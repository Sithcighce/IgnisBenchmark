This article reviews published literature on the characteristics of a liquid jet injected transversally into
a subsonic gaseous crossflow. The review covers the following aspects: (і) liquid jet primary breakup regimes,
(іі) liquid jet trajectory and penetration, (ііі) liquid jet breakup length, and (іv) droplets features and for-
mation mechanisms. The focus is on analyzing the role of different prominent parameters which include
gaseous and liquid properties, and liquid injector geometry. The review revealed that gas Weber number
plays a crucial role in defining non-turbulent primary breakup regimes, while liquid jet Weber number
is of great importance for the transition to turbulent primary breakup. Jet-to-crossflow momentum flux
ratio is the most important parameter for predicting the trajectory, penetration, and breakup length of
a liquid jet in a crossflow. The characteristics of droplets disintegrated during the primary breakup are
mostly influenced by the nozzle exit conditions, whereas the characteristics of droplets produced via the
secondary breakup are strongly dependent on the velocity of cross airflow. Although the review re-
vealed that substantial progress has been made in understanding this complex two-phase flow phenomenon,
there still remain several shortcomings which require further research.

1. Introduction

The flowfield associated with a jet injected transversely into a
crossflow (referred to as JICF), also known as a transverse jet, can
be generally classified into two main categories: a gaseous (or liquid)
jet in a gaseous (or liquid) crossflow (i.e., single-phase flow), and
a liquid (or gaseous) jet in a gaseous (or liquid) crossflow (i.e., multi-
phase flow). A transverse jet has numerous applications in industrial,
environmental and natural systems. Examples of these applica-
tions include air-breathing engines (e.g., dilution air jets, turbine
blade film cooling systems, V/STOL aircraft, fuel/air mixers and
ramjet/scramjet fuel injectors), rocket engines (e.g., thrust vector
control), environmental control systems (e.g., effluent from chimney,
smokestack, and flare stacks plumes as well as liquid effluent dis-
persal in streams), and natural flows (e.g., volcanic plumes in
crosswind, bivalve clams and blue crabs, and central venous
catheters).

Earliest research of a jet in a crossflow has been motivated by
applications related to environmental problems such as plume dis-
persal from exhaust or pipe stacks or liquid effluent dispersal in
streams [1–3]. Thrust vector control in rocket engines by injecting
an array of transverse jets to deflect the flow in the nozzle, is another
example of the applications of both a liquid and a gaseous trans-
verse jet [1,2]. This jet configuration is also adopted during takeoff,
hover, and transition to wing-borne flight in vertical/short takeoff
and landing (V/STOL) aircraft for controlling the lift and thrust vectors
[1,3]. The superior mixing properties of a transverse jet compared
to a jet in quiescent surroundings make this flowfield layout ap-
pealing especially for engineering applications when rapid injectant
mixing is desired [1,2]. Also, dilution of gaseous jets is introduced
downstream of the primary and/or secondary combustion chamber
zones in order to decrease the temperature of combustion prod-
ucts before entering the turbine section of a gas turbine engine
[1,2,4,5]. Transverse injection of a liquid fuel jet into a gaseous
crossflow is an approach which is often employed in both aviation
and stationary power generation systems where rapid fuel pene-
tration, vaporization, mixing of vapor/air and ignition, and
consequently sustained combustion process are desired. This method
of liquid fuel/air mixture preparation enhances flame stabiliza-
tion, fuel conversion efficiency, and accordingly emissions reduction
[6–9]. The overall performance of a propulsion engine, in terms of
thrust and specific impulse, can be enhanced through controlled or
actively forced dilution jet injection [1,2,10]. Contrary to film-
cooling in gas turbine engines where air jets should penetrate less
and adhere to the surface as much as possible, dilution jets require
a higher penetration and spread into a crossflow [2]. Transversely
injected air jets are also used in the primary zone of gas turbine
combustors as a means of controlling the air–fuel mixture ratio and
hence the emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx). Tunable air–fuel mixing
allows simultaneous control of NOx and carbon monoxide (CO) emis-
sions [1,2,11]. In the combustion chamber of a direct injection diesel
engine, where the air has a strong swirl movement in the cylin-
der, the interaction between a diesel spray and a crossflow is of
importance [6–8].

While the focus of the present review lies on the injection of a
liquid jet into a subsonic gaseous crossflow, the main characteris-
tics of a transverse gaseous jet are relevant to the understanding
of this topic. In essence, several published studies explored the
analogy between a transverse gaseous jet and a transverse liquid
jet to overcome the lack of comprehension of the latter [9], even

though there exist some distinct differences between their fea-
tures and controlling parameters which will be discussed later on.
For instance, earlier studies (e.g., [12,13]) hypothesized that the oc-
currence of a progressive flattening of a liquid column, due to the
acceleration of the gas flow around the jet, could induce a bow (or
kidney) shape deformation of the jet cross-section. Given the simi-
larities between these two flowfields, the general features of a
transverse gaseous jet will be presented first in the following
Subsection 1.1 followed by the general features of a transverse liquid
jet and its corresponding controversial issues introduced in
Subsection 1.2.

1.1. Features of a gaseous jet in a subsonic gaseous crossflow

A gaseous jet in a gaseous crossflow has been widely investi-
gated, and several review papers on this topic are available in the
literature [1–3,14,15]. This flowfield typically consists of a jet with
a mean velocity vj injected transversely into a gaseous crossflow with
a velocity ug, and it is usually divided into two main regions: a jet
region (near-field region), where the deflection of the jet is still small,
and a wake-like region (far-field region), in which the jet is almost
aligned with the crossflow. Between these two regions, there exists
a region of high jet trajectory curvature. The interaction of a jet and
a crossflow creates a complex set of vortex structures as is de-
picted in Fig. 1. The most obvious structure is the counter-rotating
vortex pair (CVP). Other coherent structures include horseshoe-
shaped vortices, wake vortices, and jet shear layer vortices. The
horseshoe and shear layer vortices are best described in the near-
field region, whereas the CVP and wake-like characteristics are most
evident in the far-field region [15–18].

Among the non-dimensional parameters used to correlate
the observed features of this flowfield with fluid properties,
test conditions and geometrical parameters are the jet-to-

Another important feature of a transverse gaseous jet is the jet
trajectory, which is of fundamental interest and has been widely
studied [19–23]. For instance, Karagozian [20] considered a vortex
pair issuing from a jet orifice into a crossflow, and by solving the

and Mungal [21,22] employed similarity analysis and intermedi-

flux and jet trajectory. They proposed two separate correlations for
jet trajectory, one for the near-field (or jet region) and the other one
for the far-field (or wake-like region), respectively, as follows:

where cej and ceω are the entrainment coefficients in the jet and
wake-like region, respectively. Muppidi and Mahesh [23] noted that
the scaled trajectories from different experiments showed a con-
siderable scatter even for those having nearly similar velocity ratios.
They used direct numerical simulation (DNS) to examine possible
reasons of these discrepancies. They mentioned that jet trajectory
can be defined in different ways; for example, based on the local
velocity maxima, local scalar maxima, vorticity curves, and time-
averaged center streamline, where all of which could affect the
prediction of a jet trajectory. The velocity profile at the jet exit (e.g.,
a top-hat or a fully developed pipe flow profile) has also been men-
tioned as another reason of the discrepancies in predicting jet’s
trajectory.

Overall, the non-dimensional parameters used to define the fea-
tures of a gaseous transverse jet, such as q, Rej and Reg, are equally
important parameters in analyzing a liquid transverse jet as well.
Nonetheless, in the case of a liquid jet injection into a gaseous
crossflow, there exist additional physical properties, which include
surface tension due to the existence of liquid phase discontinuity
at the interface between two different fluids (i.e., liquid–gas). This
property introduces further non-dimensional parameters, such as
gas and jet Weber numbers, Ohnesorge number, and Bond number.
Moreover, while jet flow structure and trajectory are common for
both transverse gaseous and liquid jet, the breakup process is a
unique feature of a liquid jet, which is the result of the interaction
between different forces (i.e., kinetic energy of a liquid and gaseous
flow, surface tension forces) on the liquid/gas interface. This yields
to one of the most challenging aspects of a liquid jet in a subsonic
gaseous crossflow, which is named primary breakup. The afore-
mentioned non-dimensional key parameters along with the features
relevant to a transverse liquid jet in a gaseous crossflow are dis-
cussed in the next sub-section.

1.2. Features of a liquid jet in a subsonic gaseous crossflow

A schematic view of a liquid jet penetrating into a subsonic
gaseous crossflow is illustrated in Fig. 2. From hydrodynamic in-
stability analysis perspective, liquid jet leaves the nozzle as an
unbroken column, begins to ruffle as a result of axial instability which
develops along the liquid column and finally breaks up into drop-
lets and ligaments, which is named column breakup process [25–30],
as is illustrated in Fig. 2. In this mode, the spray trajectory is un-
steady or oscillatory [31]. As liquid begins to disintegrate from the
jet surface (as a result of hydrodynamic instabilities on the jet lateral
surface [26]) and the surface breakup process becomes dominant
(see Fig. 2), the jet penetration height decreases [32]. An alterna-
tive perspective for the surface breakup of a liquid jet is the boundary

lines show the liquid column and spray plume regions, respectively. (Reprinted from

layer stripping mechanism, in which a viscous boundary layer forms
inside the jet due to the outer gas flow [26–29]. In this regard, two
major models have been developed to predict the mass shedding
due to atomization. The first is the Kelvin–Helmholtz model [33,34],
which deduces the mass removal rate from the wavelength and
growth rate of the fastest growing surface wave, calculated on the
basis of a linearized stability analysis. The second is the Boundary
Layer Stripping (BLS) model [35,36]. The basic assumption for this
model is that the mass removed from the jet coincides with the flow
rate in the liquid boundary layer at the separation point, taken for
simplicity as the equatorial plane normal to the airflow. It should
be noted that both column and surface breakup mechanisms coexist
but with the predominance of one over the other [37]. Overall, the
liquid fragments shedding from a jet along its trajectory undergo
subsequent secondary breakup process leading to smaller drop-
lets, and consequently the formation of a spray. This mode is
favorable for a better atomization and the formation of a steady or
non-oscillatory spray [31].

In order to better understand the physics of a transverse liquid
jet, it is preferable to use non-dimensional parameters to express the
level dependency of its features (such as jet’s breakup regimes, tra-
jectory and penetration, breakup length and droplets formation) on
fluid properties, test/operating conditions and geometrical param-
eters. The important variables relevant to this flowfield can be divided
into three groups [38]. The first group contains the liquid-related pa-
rameters which include jet velocity, vj, liquid density, ρj, surface
tension, σ, and dynamic viscosity, μj. The second group comprises the
gaseous phase (i.e., crossflow) parameters which include ug, ρg and
μg which are the gas density, velocity, and dynamic viscosity, respec-
tively. Finally, the third group consists of the geometrical and
surroundings parameters. For example, for a liquid jet injected trans-
versely into a gaseous medium, these parameters consist of liquid
injector/nozzle geometry (i.e., jet diameter, dj) and gravity, g. [39]. For
an angled injection, one could add another parameter to account for
the effect of the nozzle tilt. Employing different approaches like the
Buckingham π theorem to evaluate the dimensional relationship
between the different terms (e.g., [40]), a particular feature of a liquid
jet in a cross flow (e.g., trajectory and penetration) can be written
as a function of the jet-to-crossflow momentum flux ratio, q, jet Reyn-
olds number, Rej, and crossflow Reynolds number, Reg, similar to a
gaseous transverse jet. Moreover, due to the fact that a liquid jet has

different properties than a gaseous counterpart, such as liquid surface
tension, σ, additional non-dimensional parameters are then needed
to completely define its features. It includes gas Weber number

the ratio of gas and liquid inertial forces to the liquid surface

From a practical point of view, the study of a liquid jet in a
gaseous crossflow has several challenges. A reason for this is that
a transverse jet cannot be reduced to a one-dimensional scheme
as the liquid bending in a crossflow induces a greater complexity
than the injection of a liquid jet in quiescent or co-flowing sur-
roundings. Furthermore, the core of a transverse liquid jet (i.e., liquid
column) forms a continuous stream when leaving the injector/
orifice till the first point of its complete fracture, namely column
breakup point. This core may be turbulent or non-turbulent at the
injector/nozzle exit and will in either case exhibit distinct primary
breakup characteristics. The lack of a total understanding of the
mechanisms characterizing turbulent regime, as it spans between
the extreme cases of Rayleigh breakup and fully developed atomi-
zation, is reflected by the lack of models for the atomization in the
this regime [9]. Due to the complexity associated with the theory
behind this subject, a large body of studies on this topic is exper-
imental; however, several experimental challenges such as the
limitations in observing the dense spray region are slowing down
our progress in understanding this topic. Moreover, the features of
a transverse liquid jet vary significantly with liquid properties,
operating/test conditions and nozzle internal geometry. To date,
several attempts have been made to gain a global understanding
of the complex process of a transverse liquid jet. For instance, several
empirical maps for predicting liquid jet primary breakup regimes,
and numerous correlations for predicting trajectory, penetration,
breakup length and droplets formation have been reported in the
literature (e.g., [27,29,37] to cite only a few). However, as it will be
shown in the present review, there is still no general consensus about
some of these aforementioned concepts. Thus, further research is
required in order to gain a better understanding of the features of
this important process/phenomenon which in turn will help design
more efficient power and propulsion systems that employ a trans-
verse liquid jet.

In this regard, three aspects of a liquid jet in a subsonic gaseous
crossflow are reviewed in the present review paper as follows: (і)
definition and specifications of a transverse liquid jet’s primary
breakup regimes, (іі) prediction of a liquid jet trajectory and its pen-
etration behavior in a crossflow, (ііі) liquid jet breakup length, and
(іv) droplets features and formation mechanisms. The effects of dif-
ferent operating/test conditions, liquid properties, nozzle internal
geometry and other effective parameters are considered. These four
concepts are of great importance as they have direct influence on
the secondary breakup, droplets velocity and size distribution, drops
collision and vaporization, mixing rate and finally the efficiency of
liquid fuel combustion. In essence, similar to the importance of iden-
tifying whether a single-phase flow is laminar or turbulent,
specification of the topology, or liquid jet primary breakup regime,
is a critical issue in the understanding of a transverse liquid jet. Fur-
thermore, information describing a liquid jet trajectory and its
penetration in a crossflow is highly required for the design of com-
bustion chambers as it determines the distribution of fuel, which
for instance plays a key role in preventing fuel impingement onto
the walls of a combustor [38]. For example, in some configura-
tions of lean premixed prevaporized (LPP) combustion [41], the range
of q should be kept less than 15 in order to avoid fuel impinge-
ment on the combustor walls. In addition, similar to the potential
core of a single phase jet, or the liquid core of a liquid jet in qui-

escent gas, liquid jet breakup length is an important feature for
modeling a transverse liquid jet.

Motivated by the aforementioned applications along with the
features and challenges of a liquid jet injected transversely into a
gaseous crossflow, a comprehensive review on this subject seems
to be required not only to examine related published literature, but
also to shed light on the remaining challenges for future work. Due
to space limitations and also to keep coherent the topic in ques-
tion, the scope of this review is limited to recent results and major
findings of non-evaporating, non-reacting round (or canonical) liquid
jets in subsonic gaseous crossflows with uniform velocity fields and
negligible turbulence in near-wall gas boundary layers. Further-
more, conditions for the appearance of non-turbulent and turbulent
round liquid jets are obtained from the primary breakup regime map
proposed by Wu et al. [42]. According to this map, liquid jet has
smooth surface with no reattachment (i.e., implying a non-turbulent
flow) for a nozzle’s length/diameter ratio less than 4–6 at high Rej.
On the other hand, a nozzle with a larger length/diameter ratio gen-
erates a fully developed turbulent flow at the jet exit for sufficiently
high Rej. In this regard, Section 2 is intended to provide a review
of the primary breakup of non-turbulent and turbulent liquid jets
in a subsonic gaseous crossflow. The two major features of this
flowfield, namely trajectory/penetration and breakup length, are ex-
amined in Sections 3 and 4, respectively. The outcome of liquid jet
breakup which includes droplets breakup rate, size and velocity dis-
tribution is reviewed in Section 5. Finally, concluding remarks along
with future research and directions are provided in Section 6.

2. Liquid jet primary breakup regimes

2.1. Non-turbulent liquid jet primary breakup

Numerous empirical maps for predicting the primary breakup
regimes of a non-turbulent liquid jet injected into a subsonic gaseous
crossflow have been proposed in the literature. For all of these maps,
Weg seems to be the most effective non-dimensional parameter for
defining the primary breakup regimes. However, there exist other
different types of maps in the literature, such as Weg − q
(e.g.,
(e.g.,
[28,29]), We
(e.g., [28,29]), and
Weg − Rej [46].

The most common map for classifying the primary breakup
regimes is Weg − q map. It was first proposed by Wu et al. [27] to
classify the observed breakup characteristics of a liquid jet in a
gaseous crossflow. Wu et al. [27] asserted that since the breakup
process of a liquid jet and a spherical droplet in an airflow are both
caused by aerodynamic forces, the general understanding of the aero-
dynamic secondary breakup of drops could be applicable to the
primary breakup of a liquid jet. They classified the observed breakup
characteristics of a liquid jet in a crossflow into two main regimes
(i.e., column and surface breakup) based on the q and Weg. They con-
cluded that column breakup can be observed at low q and/or low
Weg, and the surface breakup regime occurs at high q and/or high
Weg. Wu et al. [27] also divided the column breakup region in their
breakup map into four sub-regions depending on Weg (i.e., en-
hanced capillary, bag, multimode and shear breakup). For Weg < 11,
the breakup process is caused by capillary forces, and referred to
as enhanced capillary breakup. At somewhat higher Weber number
(11 < Weg < 30), a transition occurs where both column and bag
breakup are observed. At 30 < Weg < 90, the breakup process is a mul-
timode with bag breakup giving way to surface stripping, and finally
shear breakup process for 90 < Weg. The breakup regime map dis-
playing the different regimes of jet breakup, as well as the transition
borderline between column and surface breakup based on
the visual observation of the work of Wu et al. [27] is depicted in

Fig. 3. Their column/surface breakup borderline is given by

. Nonetheless, they mentioned that since this is
a gradual transition, identifying a clear threshold for the transi-
tion between these two regimes is inconclusive and further studies
are needed to identify mechanisms for this transition.

Tambe et al. [41] conducted a parametric study of a liquid jet
in a gaseous crossflow at standard temperature and pressure (STP)
test conditions by focusing on the behavior of jet column and spray
after breakup. They provided a Weg − q primary breakup regime map
and observed similar breakup modes (i.e., column and surface
breakup) to those reported by Wu et al. [27], and labeled the tran-
sition between these two modes as mixed breakup mode. Their
transition (mixed) regime, however, occurred at lower q and Weg
as compared to that observed by Wu et al. [27]. They plotted the
transition borderline between the column and surface breakup mode,
and observed a steeper slope of the line, after which they con-
cluded that the effect of Weg on the transition is stronger than that
of q. Brown and McDonell [47] also proposed a Weg − q breakup
regime map using the test conditions of Wu et al. [27] while con-
sidering the effect of nozzle discharge coefficient (they examined
different nozzle diameters, 0.48, 0.94, and 1.30 mm, having dis-
charge coefficients of 0.88, 0.71 and 0.76, respectively). Similar to
earliest studies (Wu et al. [27], and Tambe et al. [41]), they ob-
served two types of breakup regimes: column and surface breakup.
They suggested that Weg plays a stronger role and the transition
region from column to surface dominated liquid breakup at lower
q than that previously suggested by Wu et al. [27], which is con-
sistent with the observations of Tambe et al. [41].

Lakhamraju and Jeng [48] investigated the effect of elevated tem-
perature at atmospheric (standard) pressure (HTSP) on the primary
breakup regimes of a liquid jet in an air crossflow. They also varied
separately the temperature of both, liquid jet and air crossflow, up
to 363 and 505 K, respectively, in order to test a wide range of test
conditions. Consistent with the earlier studies of Wu et al. [27],
Tambe et al. [41] and Brown and McDonell [47], they identified two
types of breakup regimes: column and surface breakup plotted on
a Weg − q primary breakup regime map. Similar to Tambe et al. [41],
their transition (or mixed) region occurred at lower q and Weg com-
pared to that of Wu et al. [27]. However, their transition has a steep
borderline compared with that of Wu et al. [27], which is different
from the observations of Tambe et al. [41].

Becker and Hassa [37] investigated the effect of elevated pres-
sure at room/standard temperature (STHP; that is, up to 15 bar at
290 K) on the primary breakup regimes of a plain jet in an air
crossflow. Similar to Wu et al. [27], they confirmed that two basic
breakup mechanisms can be discerned (i.e., column breakup and
surface breakup). Their data, which were taken at different range
of air pressure and velocity (50–100 m/s), showed a good agree-
ment with the primary breakup regime map of Wu et al. [27].
Elshamy and Jeng [49] also studied the effect of elevated pressure
at room temperature (STHP) on the primary breakup regimes of a
water jet in an air crossflow, where air velocity ranged from 39 to
306 m/s, and air pressure varied up to 7 bar at room temperature.
Similar to Wu et al. [27], Tambe et al. [41], Brown and McDonell
[47], Lakhamraju and Jeng [48] and Becker and Hassa [37], they pro-
vided a Weg − q primary breakup regime map and observed similar
breakup modes; that is, column and surface breakup, and labeled
the transition between these two modes as mixed breakup mode.
However, their transition (or mixed) region borders were wider (that
is; lower q and Weg for the lower limit, and higher q and Weg for
the upper limit) compared to those of Wu et al. [27]. Moreover, their
transition is somehow steeper than the transition borderline of Wu
et al. [27] consistent with the observations of Tambe et al. [41]. Re-
cently, Song et al. [50] studied the breakup, penetration, droplet size,
and size distribution of A-1 fuel jet in air crossflow at elevated pres-
sure and room temperature (STHP) test conditions. Song et al. [50]
plotted their data on a Weg − q map and proposed a correlation for
the boundary between column and surface breakup as a function
of q, liquid/gas density and viscosity ratio, and mean drop size. They
remarked that the transition borderline between the column and
surface breakup shifted towards higher q and Weg when increas-
ing the pressure of air crossflow.

The other map type used to classify breakup characteristics of
a liquid jet in a gaseous crossflow is Weg − Wej map, which was first
proposed by Vich and Ledoux [43]. They investigated the basic dis-
integration mechanisms of a liquid jet (velocity ranged from 5 to
23 m/s) in a low speed crossflow (velocity ranged from 5 to 45 m/
s) at room (STP) test conditions. Several injector diameters of 0.5 mm,
1.0 mm or 1.5 mm were tested. Similar to Wu et al. [27], Vich and
Ledoux [43] reported similarities between the breakup properties
of a round liquid jet in a gaseous crossflow and the secondary
breakup of drops. Vich and Ledoux [43] found several breakup

regimes, namely type Ι (called no crossflow action breakup), arcade
breakup named type II (i.e., liquid column breakup at small Weber
number), and bag breakup referred to as type ΙΙΙ, as depicted in Fig. 4.
It should be noted that Vich and Ledoux [43] considered Weg up to
about 100 which (will be discussed later on) does not cover the shear
breakup regime, whereas Wu et al. [27] included a wider range of
Weg, close to 1000, in order to cover all breakup regimes in their
map.

Vich and Ledoux [43] provided a breakup regime map based on
Weg − Wej by accounting for the influence of Wej in terms of q (i.e.,
as Wej = q Weg), and indicated that the type Ι mode of breakup,
defined as a breakup not modified by the crossflow, is effective up
to Weg ~ 1.5. The transition to type ΙΙ or ΙΙΙ appears also to be gov-
erned by the gas Weber number, where the same transition criterion
( Weg ∼ 8) from type Ι to type ΙΙ or ΙΙΙ was found. They pointed out,
however, that the transition from Ι to ΙΙ was obtained for Wej < 250
as is illustrated in Fig. 5. They remarked that a Weg ~ 10 has a strong
influence on aerodynamic forces. They also provided a breakup
regime map based on 1 q We j

Using the same primary breakup regime map as Vich and Ledoux
[43], Birouk et al. [44,51] studied the effect of liquid viscosity on
the primary breakup of a viscous liquid jet at STP test conditions.
They conducted experiments by injecting perpendicularly aero-
engine lubrication oil into an air crossflow. Only two types of jet
breakup regimes were identified for their explored range of test

gested by Vich and Ledoux [43]. In addition to Weg − Wej map, Birouk
et al. [44] used a 1 q We j
map to show the two identified breakup
regimes and the transition region between them. They reported that
the transition between these two modes occurred when Weg = 3–9
for the range of Wej = 149–939.

Mazallon et al. [28] extended the investigations of Wu et al.
[27] and Vich and Ledoux [43] to quantify the effect of parameters
that have influence on the properties of both the primary breakup
of a liquid jet in a crossflow and secondary breakup of drops. In-
spired by the studies of Hinze [52] on the secondary breakup of
drops exposed to shockwave disturbances at large liquid/gas density
ratio conditions, Mazallon et al. [28] exploited an analogy between
the primary breakup regimes of a round non-turbulent liquid jet
in a crossflow and the secondary breakup of drops subjected to
shockwave disturbances, and consequently classified the primary
breakup regimes in terms of gas Weber number (Weg) and Ohnesorge
number (Oh). Similar to Wu et al. [27], they found four breakup
regimes, though with slightly different transition ranges, namely
capillary breakup (Weg < 5), bag breakup (5 < Weg < 60), bag/shear
breakup (60 < Weg < 110), and shear breakup (110 < Weg). They con-
sidered the ratio of liquid/gas density, ρj/ρg, of 700–1100, and the
ratio of liquid-viscous/surface-tension forces expressed in terms
of Ohnesorge number, Oh, in the range of 0.00006–0.3. Several dif-
ferent round sharp edged (Borda) nozzles (2, 4, and 16 mm diameter)
and a round supercavitating nozzle (1 mm diameter having a sharp-
edged inlet and exit with a length/diameter ratio less than 3) were
employed in this study in order to generate uniform nonturbulent
round liquid jets. Based on the work of Dai et al. [53] and Lienhard
[54], Mazallon et al. [28] adopted an actual liquid jet diameter of
only 50–70% of the geometric diameter of Borda and supercavitating
nozzle. Both a shock tube and a subsonic wind tunnel were used
to generate a crossflow. Within the range of their test conditions,
Mazallon et al. [28] remarked that the primary breakup regimes
were relatively independent of Oh. Within the shear breakup regime,
however, they mentioned that the length of the ligament being
stripped from the sides of the liquid column increased progres-
sively with increasing Oh number. Thus, similar to the secondary
breakup of drops in the shear breakup regime [55], a long-
ligament breakup regime was defined for Oh > 0.1. They mentioned
that the long ligament regime presents significant experimental
difficulties due to the problem of tracking the flow behavior when
ligaments are long. They also reported that, due to the limited di-
mensions of their crossflow, the transition of a stable liquid jet to
the capillary breakup regime at very low crossflow velocity could
not be found. Mazallon et al. [28] observed two types of waves in
the streamwise direction along the liquid column; the wavelengths

in subsonic gaseous crossflow: no breakup (Weg = 0), column breakup
(Weg ≤ 4), bag breakup (4 < Weg < 30), multimode breakup
(30 < Weg < 110), and shear breakup (110 < Weg) regimes. These
regimes are nearly similar to those of Mazallon et al. [28]. A sample
of two-dimensional images of the different modes of jet breakup
regimes is shown in Fig. 7.

Furthermore, similar to Mazallon et al. [28], Sallam et al. [29]
used the similarities between the primary breakup regimes of a
round non-turbulent liquid jet in a crossflow and the secondary
breakup of drops subjected to shockwave disturbances, and corre-
lated the breakup regimes of a round non-turbulent liquid jet in a
crossflow in terms of Weg and Oh number. In order to show this re-
lationship, the secondary breakup regime map for drops of Hsiang
and Faeth [55] was also depicted in Fig. 8 along with the Oh − Weg
map of Mazallon et al. [28] and Sallam et al. [29].

According to Fig. 8, the main difference between the breakup of
a drop and that of a liquid jet resides in the fact that the second-
ary breakup of a drop does not exhibit behavior analogous to
enhanced capillary breakup (i.e., named in this figure as column
breakup) and it is characterized only by drop deformation regime
prior to transition to the bag breakup regime. In addition, the sec-
ondary breakup of a drop responds to a greater degree to increasing
Oh than liquid jet breakup for Oh > 0.3. For Oh < 0.3, however, the
transition to drop secondary breakup regimes becomes relatively
independent of Oh number similar to liquid jet primary breakup.
As is illustrated in Fig. 8, the secondary breakup of a drop has the
following transitions: deformation (Weg < 13), bag breakup
(13 < Weg < 35), multimode breakup (35 < Weg < 80), and shear
breakup (80 < Weg). Overall, while the effect of Oh number on
breakup regime transition was not considered in the earliest studies
(see, e.g., Wu et al. [27], and Vich and Ledoux [43]), Mazallon et al.
[28] and Sallam et al. [29] remarked that the transition between
various breakup regimes is not affected significantly by liquid vis-
cosity for low viscous liquids (i.e., Oh < 0.3) and by liquid jet exit
velocity (i.e., for q < 8000). They pointed out that an increased liquid
stream velocity would stretch out the breakup process in the liquid
jet streamwise and produces higher speed drops.

Following Mazallon et al. [28], Sallam et al. [29] reported a cor-
relation between λs/dj and breakup regimes, where λs is the
wavelength of the longitudinal waves on the windward side. They
observed column breakup for λs/dj > 1, bag breakup for λs/dj ≈ 1, mul-
timode region featuring surface stripping and column breakup for

the deflection of the entire liquid column at small Weg, and the
smaller wavelength, namely surface wavelength λs associated with
periodic disturbances of the liquid stripping along the sides of the
liquid column at larger Weg. They concluded that these wave-
lengths are mainly a function of Weg, and there is a clear relationship
between λc and λs and the properties of bag, bag/shear, and shear
breakup of a liquid jet in a crossflow. They, therefore, provided

Later on, Sallam et al. [29], following the work of Mazallon et al.

Ng et al. [45] investigated experimentally one of the primary
breakup regimes (bag breakup) of a non-turbulent liquid jet in
a gaseous crossflow at room temperature and atmospheric
pressure (STP). Similar to Mazallon et al. [28], they provided a
We
primary breakup regime map with specific Weg cor-
responding to the transition between different breakup regimes, as
shown in Fig. 10. They, however, reconsidered the map and showed
theoretically and experimentally that the wavelength of the column
waves observed by Mazallon et al. [28] for the bag breakup regime
has somewhat stronger dependence on Weg than in their case.

At the same time, Madabhushi et al. [46] revisited the Weg − q

provided a Weg − Rej map. They plotted the breakup data reported in
references [37,47] along with their data in terms of Weg and Rej, as
is illustrated in Fig. 11. From their analysis, they concluded that the
surface breakup-dominated points have jet Reynolds number of ap-
proximately 5000 or higher (i.e., beyond the laminar to turbulent flow
transition), whereas most of the column breakup dominated points
fall below this line. Thus, the Rej = 5000 line was taken as the tran-
sition between the surface and column breakup-dominated regimes.
Aalburg et al. [56] performed a numerical study to determine
the deformation and breakup properties of a non-turbulent liquid
jet in a gaseous crossflow at conditions that are difficult to address
using experiments (i.e., large Ohnesorge number where liquid vis-
cosity effect is important). Their computational test conditions were
set as follows: Reg = 12.5–200, Weg = 0.1–100,000, Oh = 0.001–100,
liquid/gas density ratios of 2–∞, and liquid/gas molecular viscosi-
ty ratios of 0.001–1000. Aalburg et al. [56] suggested that the
predicted normalized maximum (that is, (dcmax-d0)/d0 =100% where
dcmax and d0 are, respectively, the maximum dimension of the liquid
jet in the crossflow direction, and initial diameter) deformation pro-
vided a reasonable estimate of conditions required for the onset of
breakup. Using the classical Oh − Weg coordinates of Hinze [52], they
provided a liquid jet breakup regime map. Aalburg et al. [56] re-
marked that liquid/gas density ratio has a little effect on the
deformation and breakup regime boundaries of a non-turbulent
liquid jet in a gaseous crossflow for ρj/ρg > 30, and particularly when
Oh is small. They also demonstrated that there was a significant in-
crease in the resistance of a liquid jet to deformation when gas
Reynolds number approached small values typically of the order
of Stokes flow regime. They also found that at large Ohnesorge
number, where liquid viscosity effect is more important than that
of surface tension, jet deformation is controlled by a new dimen-
sionless number We
. Consequently, they constructed a
breakup regime map for large Oh using the drag/liquid viscous forces
ratio We
and surface tension force/liquid viscous forces 1/Oh
as the map coordinates, as shown in Fig. 12.

As is illustrated in Fig. 12, Aalburg et al. [56] remarked that, for
Oh < 1, the measured and predicted deformation and breakup regime
transitions are independent of Oh and can be identified through Weg,
which is in agreement with previous observations (see, e.g., Wu et al.
[27], Mazallon et al. [28], or Sallam et al. [29]). In contrast, for Oh ⪢ 1,
their predictions indicated that Weg ~ Oh2.

2.2. Primary breakup of turbulent liquid jet

The effect of liquid jet turbulence on the primary breakup regimes
of a round liquid jet in a subsonic gaseous crossflow is reviewed
in this section. Drops formation along the surface of a turbulent
liquid jet, called turbulent primary breakup, is a common mecha-
nism of spray formation in practical combustion devices. It is
worth mentioning that the contraction of a nozzle/injector must
be followed by a long orifice length/diameter ratio passage to
yield a fully developed turbulent pipe flow for sufficiently large
liquid jet Reynolds numbers [42]. There exist several published
maps for classifying the primary breakup regimes of a turbulent
liquid jet in a subsonic gaseous crossflow, which include Tb − θ

One of the first attempts to classify the primary breakup regimes
of a turbulent liquid jet at STP test conditions was conducted by
Fuller et al. [57]. They provided a breakup regime map that divided
the column breakup process into two distinct regimes: aerody-
namic regime (i.e., column fracture as a result of aerodynamic forces
associated with the gaseous crossflow) and non-aerodynamic regime
(i.e., column fracture resulting from the instability generated by liquid
turbulence and liquid inertial forces). The transition criterion between
aerodynamic and non-aerodynamic breakup Tb was found equal to

as the ratio of the aerodynamic to non-aerodynamic breakup
timescale. As is illustrated in Fig. 13, for Tb < 1, column breakup is
largely dominated by aerodynamic forces; however, surface waves
become more complex and the atomization process is enhanced as
Tb is decreased. On the other hand, for Tb > 1, column breakup is
largely dominated by nonaerodynamic forces; however, the liquid
column becomes very straight and the atomization process is in-
hibited as Tb is increased. To consider the effect of injection angle
on the breakup process of a turbulent liquid jet in a subsonic gaseous
crossflow, Fuller et al. [57] conducted an experimental investiga-
tion with water as the test liquid where 30, 45, 60, 75, and 90 degrees
injection angles (θ) were tested. Although Fuller et al. [57] consid-
ered the effect of the injection angle on the breakup properties of
a turbulent liquid jet, they did not provide much information about
the effect of liquid turbulence on the breakup properties of a trans-
verse liquid jet.

Aalburg et al. [61] investigated experimentally the deforma-
tion and breakup properties of a turbulent liquid jet in a gaseous
crossflow at STP test conditions. Following the earlier phenomeno-
logical analyses of Wu and Faeth [62], they provided conditions for
the aerodynamically-enhanced streamwise location of the onset of
turbulent primary breakup along the liquid surface as a function
of a new Weber number based on jet exit radial (i.e., cross-stream)

occurred at some distance from the jet exit, and nearing atomiza-
tion breakup conditions at large WeLΛ. They also concluded that,
within the range of their test conditions, turbulent primary breakup
dominated aerodynamic effect so that crossflow did not exert any
influence on the ligament properties. They justified this process using
the observations of Wu and Faeth [62] who found negligible aero-
dynamic effect for a liquid jet in a quiescent gaseous medium with
a density ratio of ρ ρj
g > 500 . Thus, they suggested larger crossflow
velocities and smaller ρj/ρg ratio should be considered in order to
effectively examine the effect of aerodynamic forces. Sankarakrishnan

et al. [63] extended the measurements of Aalburg et al. [61] in order
to address the effect of the degree of turbulence development in
the fluid (i.e., partially or fully developed turbulence) using a pipe
having a diameter of 2.0 and 4.0 mm with a length/diameter ratio
greater than 40 in order to achieve a fully developed turbulent pipe
flow. They reported four regimes of the primary breakup at low jet
exit Reynolds number similar to the breakup of non-turbulent
breakup regimes. They, therefore, suggested that there is an analogy
between the primary breakup of a weakly turbulent round liquid
jet in a crossflow and the secondary breakup of a drop. At high jet

crossflow. Round nozzles with longue length/diameter ratio (>40)
were used to generate fully developed turbulent pipe flow at the
nozzle exit. Consistent with the observations of Sankarakrishnan
et al. [63], they reported that, at low Rej when Weg was kept con-
stant, the breakup regimes were similar to those of a non-
turbulent liquid jet in a crossflow (bag breakup according to images
(a) and (b) in Fig. 14). At high Rej, no bags were observed where
the breakup was characterized by irregularities on the jet surface
which increased downstream of the jet exit and consequently led
to the formation of ligaments and drops (i.e., see images (c), (d)
and (e) in Fig. 14). No difference is observed in the breakup mecha-
nisms among the different liquids shown in Fig. 14(c), (d) and (e).
This is because these images are captured at atmospheric/room
temperature closer to the nozzle exit. However, at elevated tem-
perature, ethanol evaporates faster than water and consequently
would exhibit different jet characteristics particularly in the far-
field region [64].

Sallam et al. [58], therefore, classified the breakup of a fully tur-
bulent liquid jet in a gaseous crossflow into two major regimes
known as aerodynamic breakup regime (including column, bag, mul-
timode, and shear breakup, which is similar in appearance to the
breakup of a non-turbulent liquid jet in a crossflow), and turbu-
lent breakup regime (which is characterized by the appearance
of ligaments and drops at the upwind surface and an increased
jet column diameter with increasing distance from the jet exit).
These two regimes were separated by Weber number based on
jet exit radial (cross-stream) integral length scale as follows:

As is illustrated in Fig. 15, both turbulent and aerodynamic
breakup is occurred in the range of jet Reynolds number Rej = 6000–
1 3. However, only
60,000, with the transition controlled by We qLΛ
aerodynamic breakup is occurred for Rej < 6000, and only turbu-
lent breakup is observed for Rej > 60,000.

Lee et al. [65] investigated the deformation and breakup prop-
erties of a turbulent liquid jet in a gaseous crossflow. They employed
nearly the same test conditions, liquid properties, and injector ge-
ometry as those of Aalburg et al. [61]. Lee et al. [65] reported that
a turbulent liquid jet did not exhibit the same behavior as a non-
turbulent jet, which is in contrast with the observations of
Sankarakrishnan et al. [63] especially at low jet exit Reynolds number.
For instance, the Weg associated with images (a) and (b) in Fig. 16

exit Reynolds number, however, they remarked that turbulent
primary breakup dominated the surface breakup mechanism even
on the upstream side of a spray, suggesting weak aerodynamic effect
on a fully-developed turbulent liquid jet. It should be noted that
Sankarakrishnan et al. [63] did not define the transition criterion
between a weakly-turbulent and a fully turbulent breakup regime.
However, they provided the onset of turbulent primary breakup time
ti as a function of the viscosity ratio and Weg.

Following the study of Sankarakrishnan et al. [63], Sallam et al.
[58] conducted an experimental and computational investigation
on the turbulent primary breakup of a round liquid jet in a gaseous

surface as a function of WeLΛ, allowing for aerodynamic enhance-
ment of the breakup process due to the presence of crossflow.

Inspired by earlier studies of the effect of nozzle length/
diameter on liquid jet instabilities in quiescent air (see, e.g., [53,60]),
and following the study of Sallam et al. [58] on turbulent primary
breakup, Osta et al. [59,60] conducted an experimental study to
examine the effect of nozzle length/diameter ratio on the transi-
tion criterion of a turbulent liquid jet. Straight nozzles with length/
diameter ratios of 10, 20, and 40 were used to generate turbulent
liquid jet in a gaseous crossflow at STP test conditions. Similar to
Sallam et al. [58], Osta et al. [59,60] used the formation of liga-
ments on the upstream surface of a turbulent liquid jet in a crossflow
to classify the breakup-regime map into two major regimes known
as aerodynamic and turbulent breakup regimes. They concluded
that: (i) the breakup length of a turbulent liquid jet in a crossflow
decreases with increasing the injector length/diameter ratio which
is probably due to increased turbulence level induced by the longer
orifice passage, and (ii) a liquid jet issued from a longer injector
passage tends to have earlier transition to turbulent primary breakup.

correspondent to bag or multimode breakup regime for a non-
turbulent liquid jet; however, these images reveal that the jet exhibits
a behavior like shear breakup regime (i.e., identified by the pres-
ence of ligaments and absence of liquid bags). Lee et al. [65]
represented liquid turbulence using liquid Weber number Wej. As
it is displayed in Fig. 16, they observed that the increase in liquid
turbulence (Fig. 16a and b) enhanced the formation of ligaments
and subsequently drops which then accelerated the onset of breakup.
The effect of crossflow on promoting the formation of ligaments and
drops can be noticed in Fig. 16b–d.

Similar to Aalburg et al. [61], Lee et al. [65], following the earlier
phenomenological analyses of Wu and Faeth [62], provided con-
ditions for the onset of turbulent primary breakup along the liquid

Recently, Zheng and Marshall [66] conducted an experimental
study to investigate the primary breakup regimes of a round liquid
(water) jet in an air crossflow at low ranges of q = 10–50 and Weg = 4–
16 at standard/room temperature and pressure (STP) conditions. They
provided a Weg − q regime map and reported two breakup regimes:
capillary enhanced breakup (named column breakup) and bag
breakup. They concluded that the transition between these two
breakup modes occurs at Weg = 8–12. They also mentioned that for
q > 40, this transition happens earlier which they attributed to the
fact that liquid jet breakup would be facilitated/promoted at higher
q. Nonetheless, they did not explore the transition borderline
between the aerodynamic and turbulent breakup regimes.

Eslamian et al. [31] experimentally studied the effect of el-
evated temperature and pressure (HTP; ranged from 298 to 573 K

and from 207 to 517 kPa, respectively) of a subsonic air crossflow
on the primary breakup regimes of a transversally injected water
jet. Eslamian et al. [31] employed a Weg − q breakup regime map
similar to the map of a non-turbulent liquid jet. They concluded that,
at both elevated temperature and pressure (HTP) conditions, the
surface breakup mode was initiated at lower q and Weg in compar-
ison with the transition borderline of Becker and Hassa [37], who
also examined the effect of crossflow pressure but at room tem-
perature (STP) conditions. Moreover, Eslamian et al. [31] showed
that the surface breakup mode was initiated at lower q and Weg,
which is in contrast with the findings of Song et al. [50] who studied
the breakup of a non-turbulent liquid jet in a crossflow at el-
evated pressures and stated that the transition borderline between
the column and surface breakup shifted towards higher q and Weg
when increasing cross airflow pressure.

2.3. Concluding remarks on liquid jet primary breakup

Given the results available thus far concerning the primary
breakup regimes of a non-turbulent liquid jet in a subsonic gaseous
crossflow, with the exception of Weg the identified regimes seem
to be independent of q, Wej, Oh and other non-dimensional param-
eters. Published Weg corresponding to the transition of various
breakup regimes are summarized in Table 1 below.

−

As is shown in Table 1, it is interesting to notice that Wu et al.
[27] reported similar liquid jet primary breakup regimes and tran-
sition Weber number, Weg, to those reported by Hsiang and Faeth
[55] for the secondary breakup of drops. Vich and Ledoux [43] found
that Weg for the transition to bag breakup ranges from 1.5 to 8 (that
is, an average of Weg ~ 5), while Birouk et al. [44] found an average
value of Weg = 6, which is in agreement with the finding of
Mazallon et al. [28] and Sallam et al. [29]. Zheng and Marshall [66],
however, reported larger Weg (with an average value of 10) for
the transition to bag breakup, which might be due to the fact that
they used a larger length/diameter ratio nozzle (L/d = 20) which
generates a fully developed turbulent jet (though their range
of Re j =
2000 8000), or could be a result of using a protruding
nozzle to inject liquid at 20 mm away from the nozzle-wall in order
to eliminate the effect of non-uniform velocity field in the gas bound-
ary layer along the test section. Weg found by Mazallon et al. [28]
and Sallam et al. [29] are in excellent agreement for the capillary
(column)/bag and multimode/shear breakup regime transitions.
There is, however, a great difference in the bag/multimode breakup
regime transition between Mazallon et al. [28] and Sallam et al. [29],
whereas those of Sallam et al. [29] and Wu et al. [27] are in excel-
lent agreement. It is worth mentioning that completely different
breakup regimes are observed when injecting a liquid jet into a qui-
escent gaseous medium [25,67]. These regimes can be categorized
according to Wej and Weg (where Weg is based on liquid jet veloc-
ity) as: (a) Rayleigh breakup (for Wej > 8 and Weg < 0.4), (b) first wind-
13
induced regime (for 0 4
), (c) second wind-induced regime
<Weg
), and (d) atomization regime (for Weg > 40). The
(for 13
capillary and bag breakup mechanisms of a transverse liquid jet re-
semble the first two (i.e., Rayleigh and first wind-induced) breakup
mechanisms of a liquid jet injected into quiescent gaseous medium,

where long-wavelength surface disturbances along with large dis-
integrated droplets are observed. Multimode and shear breakup
mechanisms of a transverse liquid jet are also similar to the second
wind-induced and atomization regimes of a liquid jet injected into
quiescent gas, where short-wavelength waves and smaller drop-
lets are produced.

On the other hand, there is still no consensus about the crite-
rion concerning the other breakup classification of non-turbulent
liquid jet (i.e., transition from column to surface breakup regime).
Given the fact that this transition is gradual and comprises an overlap
region for both breakup mechanisms, several studies (e.g., Wu et al.
[27] and Madabhushi et al. [46]) quoted that the exact boundaries
of this transition region in a Weg − q regime map are difficult to pin-
point. In fact, some studies defined a region while others gave a
borderline between these two breakup regimes (i.e., column and
surface breakup regimes). Some remarked a stronger dependency
[46,47,49,50], and others weaker Weg dependency [41,48] of the tran-
sition region compared to the observations of Wu et al. [27]. Some
studies, such as [31,41,48], suggested that the transition region from
column to surface dominated breakup occurs at lower q and Weg,
while others, such as [50], found it to happen at higher q and Weg
compared to the observations of Wu et al. [27]. Published data on
these transition regions and borderlines, in a Weg − q map, which
indicates the transition between column/surface breakup regime
at room and elevated test conditions, are gathered and depicted in
Fig. 17.

As is illustrated in Fig. 17, the majority of the predicted transi-
tion regions and borderlines can be located between the two dashed
lines which correlate Weg with q as follows: Weg

k ≅ 3–3.7. By performing some mathematical manipulations, the fol-

sition region for a liquid jet in a subsonic gaseous crossflow at room
(STP) and elevated (HTP) test conditions.

As for the transition criterion for turbulent breakup of a liquid

established for different test conditions, all the experiments on tur-
bulent primary breakup have been conducted at STP test conditions.
Hence, investigations on the effect of high temperature and pres-
sure (HTP) on the primary breakup regimes of a turbulent liquid
jet are needed.

The effect of non-dimensional parameters, such as Wej and Weg,
on liquid jet instabilities and surface waves along the liquid column
seems to be required, as they play a key role on the primary breakup
and size of ligaments and drops. On this issue, there is still a con-
troversy among published experimental results and the data of high
fidelity simulations. As was illustrated in Fig. 9, following Mazallon
et al. [28], Sallam et al. [29] measured experimentally the charac-
teristic length scale of the KH-like instabilities along the trajectory
of a non-turbulent liquid jet and proposed a scaling law in the form
of λ d C Weg
=
for Weg > 4, where λ is the wavelength of the dis-
turbance and C1 is a constant. Ng et al. [68] confirmed their
experimental observations by using a Volume Of Fluid (VOF) sim-
ulation approach. In contrast, for constant Wej, Pai et al. [69]
employed a spectrally refined interface tracking technique and pre-
dicted a wavelength that is almost constant across their explored
range of Weg, which does not appear to agree with the experimental

results of Sallam et al. [29] for multimode breakup regime. Sedarsky
et al. [70] reported that the correlation of Sallam et al. [29] did not
hold for their experimental data. Li and Soteriou [71] used a Coupled
Level Set and Volume Of Fluid (CLSVOF) simulation technique and
indicated that while their predictions of the surface wavelengths
matched well with the empirical correlation of Sallam et al. [29]
for low gas Weber numbers, their predictions could not be com-
pared with the empirical correlation at high gas Weber number due
to the fact that two-dimensional traveling waves were not ac-
counted for in their simulation. On the other hand, Xiao et al. [72]
adopted the same approach (i.e., CLSVOF) and indicated that their
simulated surface wavelengths at different gas Weber numbers
agreed well with the experimental measurements of Sallam et al.
[29]. Farvardin et al. [73] conducted a series of experimental tests
using biodiesel and diesel as well as their blends and confirmed the
trend of the changes of surface wavelength observed by Sallam et al.
[29]. Wang et al. [74] theoretically investigated the surface waves
of a round liquid jet in a gaseous crossflow using linear stability anal-
ysis, and reported the same trend of wavelength changes as Mazallon
et al. [28] and Sallam et al. [58]. Hence, further investigations on
the wavelength of the disturbances and their connections to the
primary breakup regimes of both turbulent and non-turbulent liquid
jets at different test conditions (standard and high test condi-
tions) are required.

3. Liquid jet trajectory and penetration

Liquid jet trajectory and its penetration in a gaseous crossflow
are among the most important features of a transverse liquid jet
as they have direct impact on the distribution of fuel spray in a com-
bustion chamber, and accordingly its evaporation and mixing rate
with oxidant. This is also important for the design of a combustor
as to prevent spray impingement onto its walls. Jet trajectory and
its penetration refer, respectively, to the trajectory up to the column
breakup point (i.e., the solid line in Fig. 2), and to the liquid maximum
penetration into a crossflow (i.e., the dashed line in Fig. 2). Numer-
ous empirical and phenomenological correlations for predicting the
trajectory and penetration of a liquid jet injected into a gaseous

crossflow were proposed in the literature. These correlations were
expressed in terms of non-dimensional parameters; such as q, Rej,
Reg, Weg, Wej, viscosity ratio and density ratio. These correlations,
however, show considerable scatter (see, e.g., [24,47,75]). These dis-
crepancies originate from the complex physics of this two-phase
flowfield as liquid jet trajectory and its penetration dependent on
a number of variables including liquid properties (e.g., density, vis-
cosity, surface tension), test conditions (e.g., temperature and
pressure of crossflow), nozzle internal geometry (e.g., discharge co-
efficient, cavitation), and measurement methods (e.g., shadowgraphy,
Mie scattering, or phase Doppler anemometry (PDPA)). Inconsis-
tency in the definition of spray boundaries is another reason of these
differences, as Herrmann et al. [76] stated that the commonly re-
ported liquid jet penetration correlations for the windward side
trajectory dependent strongly on the threshold being used to iden-
tify the leading edge. Given the variety of the aforementioned factors
it may not be possible to resolve these discrepancies completely.
However, it might be possible to narrow the gap provided that these
correlations are categorized based on proper test conditions (e.g.,
liquid properties, liquid jet and cross airflow characteristics). These
correlations may also be classified according to their mathemati-
cal functional form such as power-law, logarithmic or exponential
form. They could also be further categorized based on whether they
are applicable just to a specific region, near- or far-field, or cover
both regions such as multi zone correlations, or whether they predict
the upper or lower boundaries of a spray. Liquid jet trajectory can
also be grouped according to the primary breakup regimes (bag, mul-
timode and shear breakup regimes), as the deformation of a liquid
jet depends on the breakup regime [29]. While most of published
studies were carried out at standard temperature and pressure (STP)
conditions, still several studies were conducted at elevated crossflow
temperature and pressure (HTP). In fact, a change in test condi-
tions can lead to a change in both liquid and gas properties, which
in turn affect the trajectory and penetration of a transverse liquid
jet in a crossflow.

3.1. Standard temperature and pressure (STP) conditions

There were numerous published studies which investigated
the injection of a liquid jet into a subsonic gaseous crossflow at
standard temperature and pressure (STP) test conditions
[27,32,41,47,49,66,73,77–87]. These studies correlated liquid jet tra-

jectory mostly in terms of x/dj and q. However, a few studies which
used other liquids in addition to water included the viscosity ratio
and Weg to take into account liquid properties in order to make their
correlations comprehensive. These published correlations along with
their range of test conditions are summarized in Table 2.

These correlations are also plotted in Fig. 19 for typical q = 20
and Weg = 100, and water as liquid. Correlations that used liquids
other than water were not plotted in this figure because they did
not include liquid viscosity in their expressions which is why their
correlations [32,85,86] underpredict the trend shown in this figure.
The correlation of Zheng and Marshall [66] is excluded as it was pro-
posed for a narrow range of low Weg which is limited to the column
and bag breakup regimes. Since Stenzler et al. [79,82] reported two
correlations for nearly the same liquids and test conditions, only
the recent one is plotted in this figure. Finally, only the correlation
of Lin et al. [78] based on data obtained using PDPA technique was
considered in this figure as the one found with shadowgraph tech-
nique showed significant departure from this general trend.

These correlations plotted in Fig. 19, using water as the liquid
at STP test conditions, exhibit excellent agreement with an average
difference of around 5dj at different jet locations from the nozzle
exit up to x/dj = 100. The agreement among the predictions of these
correlations remains rather similar at different q and Weg.

3.2. High temperature and pressure (HTP) conditions

There exist several studies specifically focused on liquid jet tra-
jectory and penetration at high temperature and pressure (HTP)
test conditions. To account for the effect of HTP test conditions,
the proposed correlations included parameters such as tempera-
ture ratio, pressure ratio and density ratio in addition to x/dj and q
which were used for STP conditions as presented above. It would
be useful to categorize published correlations at HTP test condi-
tions into three subgroups: (i) high temperature and standard
pressure (HTSP); (ii) standard temperature and high pressure (STHP);
and (iii) high temperature and high pressure test conditions (HTP).
This is to facilitate understanding the effect of changing each pa-
rameter independently.

HTSP studies [48,79,82,87] examined the impact of increasing
cross airflow temperature on liquid jet trajectory and its penetra-
tion. The correlations proposed along with their range of test
conditions are summarized in Table 3.

Stenzler et al. [79,82] reported that, at constant q and ug, in-
creasing temperature led to an increase in jet penetration. In fact,
increasing temperature reduces gas density and thereby de-
creases Weg. This is why Stenzler et al. [79,82] adopted a negative
exponent of Weg to reflect on this inverse relationship. At con-
stant q, if Weg (or the gas inertial force ρg
gu2 ) decreases then Wej
(or the liquid jet inertial force ρl
jv2) must also decrease proportion-
ally. Thus, there must be another reason for the increase in jet
penetration when the gas and liquid inertial forces are equally
changed. The rate of mass shedding from droplets is directly pro-
portional to ρg and ug [88,89]. Thus, at constant ug, the rate of mass
shedding from droplets decreases with decreasing ρg leading to
larger droplets. These larger droplets, which still possess greater
momentum, penetrate farther into a crossflow. This is consistent
with the numerical analysis of Herrmann et al. [76] who reported
that the post-primary atomization spray penetrates farther in both
directions of jet and transverse when increasing ρj/ρg (or decreas-
ing ρg). Lakhamraju and Jeng [48] stated that, at constant q and
Weg (and accordingly constant Wej), jet penetration decreases with
increasing crossflow temperature. This is why their exponent of
the temperature ratio is negative, which is an indication of the
inverse relationship between jet penetration and temperature
change. In fact, at constant q and Weg, the gas inertial force ρg
gu2
and the liquid jet inertial force ρl
jv2 must be constant where an
increase in temperature will lead to a decrease in ρg and hence
increase in ug. Since the exponent of ρg is smaller than that of ug in
the correlation of the rate of mass shedding [88,89], a decrease in
ρg and an increase in ug will lead to an increase in mass shedding,
which results in smaller droplets and thereby less jet penetration.
Yoon et al. [87] reported that increasing temperature had led to
an increased jet penetration due to reduced gas density, which is
consistent with Stenzler et al. [79,82]; however, increased crossflow
velocity, ug, led to decreased jet penetration, which is consistent

with the findings of Lakhamraju and Jeng [48]. These correlations
are plotted in Fig. 20 for typical q = 20, Weg = 50 and T = 500 K with
water as the liquid.

As is illustrated in Fig. 20, similar to the STP test conditions, the
predicted trends for high temperature and standard pressure (HTSP)
at these typical test conditions differ by an average of around 5dj
from the nozzle exit up to x/dj = 30.

There exist some studies which investigated the effect of in-
creasing the pressure at room temperature of a cross airflow on liquid
jet trajectory and penetration [37,49,50,90–92]. Published correla-
tions along with their range of test conditions are tabulated in Table 4
and plotted in Fig. 21.

Becker and Hassa [37] stated that small droplets were gener-
ated at high ambient pressure, which have little inertia, especially
in a high gas density, and thus cannot penetrate very far as they
were swept away by the air stream. Freitag and Hassa [91], con-
sistent with Becker and Hassa [37], reported that the stepwise
rise of static air pressure caused finer drops to form. Elshamy and
Jeng [49] observed that, at constant q and Weg, jet penetration
slightly decreased with increased crossflow pressure. In contrast,
Song et al. [50] showed that, at constant q and Weg, spray pen-
etrated farther when increasing ambient pressure. In fact, at constant
q and Weg, both the airflow and liquid jet inertial force ρg
gu2 and
ρl
jv2 must remain constant so that an increase in ρg caused by
increasing pressure will lead to a decrease in ug. Since the expo-
nent of ρg is smaller than that of ug in the correlation of the rate of
mass shedding [88,89], an increase in ρg with a decrease in ug will
lead to a decrease in mass shedding which results in an increase
in liquid jet penetration.

As is illustrated in Fig. 21, similar to STP and HTSP test condi-
tions, the predicted trends at STHP test conditions (at typical q = 20
and Weg = 500, P = 5 bar with water as the test liquid) exhibit a

crossflow air temperature led to an increase in the rate of mass shed-
ding and consequently smaller droplets which resulted in a slight
decrease in jet penetration particularly in the far-field. On the other
hand, they asserted that, at constant q and vj (or constant Wej), an
increased ambient pressure (and hence the density, while the
crossflow velocity is decreased so that Weg is remained unchanged)
decreased the rate of mass shedding and consequently the forma-
tion of larger droplets, which resulted in an increased jet penetration
height.

As is illustrated in Fig. 22, the predictions of the proposed cor-
relations at HTP test conditions differ by about 5dj up to x d j = 10 ,
however, for larger x/dj in the far-field, Eslamian et al. [31] corre-
lation overpredicts the general trend. The correlation of Masuda and
McDonell [93] is excluded in this figure as it underpredicts largely
the general trends, which is believed to be due mainly to the fact
that their injector was mounted recessed instead of flush. In fact,
Masuda and McDonell [93] asserted that their results approached
the prediction of the correlations proposed for flush type nozzle at
high q (but not at low q), when a recess of about 10dj is added to
the measured jet penetration (which is equivalent to placing the
nozzle flush).

Several computational modeling and theoretical analyses have
been carried out to predict the trajectory and penetration of a liquid
jet injected into a cross airflow over a wide range of test condi-
tions. In general, numerical studies of a liquid jet in a cross airflow
can be categorized based on the used approach; that is, Eulerian
or Lagrangian framework. Regarding the Eulerian approach, for in-
stance, Spyrou et al. [96], and Farvardin and Dolatabadi [97]
employed a Volume Of Fluid (VOF) simulation as a surface captur-
ing model to predict the liquid jet trajectory. Pai et al. [69] employed
a spectrally refined interface tracking technique to track liquid–
gas interface. They compared their predictions of the liquid jet
trajectory at different q and Weg with the experimental results of
Lee et al. [65]. Herrmann [98,99], and Herrmann et al. [76] em-
ployed a Refined Level Set Grid (RLSG) method coupled with
Lagrangian method for small drops to perform a detailed simula-
tion of the primary atomization region. They studied the effect of
liquid/gas density ratio on liquid jet trajectory [76], and compared
their predictions with the empirical correlations of Wu et al. [27],
and Stenzler et al. [82]. Li and Soteriou [71,100] used a Coupled Level
Set and Volume Of Fluid (CLSVOF) simulation integrated with La-
grangian method for small drops. They compared liquid jet trajectory

difference of around 5dj at different distances from nozzle exit up
to x/dj = 50.

The effect of both high temperature and high pressure (HTP) of
crossflow on liquid jet trajectory and penetration was also studied
[9,31,93–95]. Publications correlations along with their range of test
conditions are summarized in Table 5 and plotted in Fig. 22.

Bellofiore et al. [9] stated that high temperature and pressure
crossflow affected the atomization level due to the change in air
density. They also mentioned that, even at T = 600 K, the evapora-
tion of water drops was not significant within 100 times the jet
diameter downstream of the injection point. Li et al. [95] varied the
crossflow density by changing the air pressure in order to examine
the effect of gas Weber number on liquid jet penetration. They re-
ported that gas Weber number did not have a significant effect on
jet penetration at both room and high temperature conditions. They,
however, mentioned that the crossflow temperature ratio has a sig-
nificant effect on jet penetration where it was greater at higher
temperature. Eslamian et al. [31] reported that an increase in

ratio is negative in Lakhamraju and Jeng [48] (at constant q and Weg),
while it is positive in Li et al. [95] (at constant q and variable Weg).
This interdependency is one of the most important reasons con-
tributing to the discrepancies between published correlations.
Ragucci et al. [94] reported that, since the heat-up time of liquid
jet is longer than the lifetime of the continuous liquid column, the
density of liquid jet can be used as a reference density for exam-
ining the impact of elevated temperature cross airflow (gas flow).
Nonetheless, the surface tension depends on the temperature at the
interface between the two (gaseous and liquid) phases, which is not
easy to estimate. Hence, while most of the studies used a refer-
ence temperature, Ragucci et al. [94] employed the lowest interfacial
temperature by following the classical approach of the vaporiza-
tion of a single-component drop in quiescent gaseous medium.
Overall, q is necessary to predict the trajectory of a jet as it repre-
sents the ratio between the gas and liquid inertial forces. The
properties of liquid jet can be accounted for using the following non-
dimensional parameters; μg/μl, Rej, or Oh. Parameters such as Weg,
ρj/ρg, or Reg can be used to represent the properties of gaseous
crossflow. Weg and ρj/ρg are important for predicting the extent of
the penetration of a liquid jet into a subsonic gaseous crossflow as
they define/dictate the size of droplets in the far-field region. On
the other hand, in the near-field region, Weg plays a key role in de-
fining the primary breakup regimes, and also in predicting the onset
time of surface breakup along the jet column [29]. Altering the
primary breakup regime of a liquid jet affects its deformation, and
consequently its penetration [29]. An increase in ρj/ρg results in a
noticeable increase in liquid core penetration with reduced bending
and spreading in the transverse directions [76]. It should be men-
tioned that out of the three dimensionless numbers q, Wej and Weg,
only two are independent. Furthermore, Wej and Rej can be related
= (
using Ohnesorge number as Oh We
. Although Lee et al.
[65] asserted that the presence of turbulence in a liquid jet has little
effect on liquid column trajectory, Rej affects the primary breakup
regimes (see Section 2) of a transverse liquid jet, as it plays a crucial
role relative to the presence of instabilities on the surface of a liquid
jet where transition from laminar to turbulent behavior occurs. Bo
number becomes important only when jet nozzle diameter exceeds
the capillary length of liquid (e.g., 2.7 mm for water) [39]. The initial
injection angle [57] and nozzle geometry (e.g., discharge coeffi-
cient) [47] are also key parameters for describing liquid jet trajectory
and penetration in a crossflow. As Brown et al. [47] mentioned, it
appears that most published jet penetration correlations assumed
a liquid jet velocity based on the volume flow rate divided by the
injector cross sectional area. However, since the actual jet velocity
is inversely promotional to the discharge coefficient of a nozzle, and
because the discharge coefficient is a function of jet Reynolds number
Rej and nozzle internal geometry, difference in the nozzle internal
geometry could be one of the reasons of the discrepancies in the
predictions of these correlations. Brown et al. [47,84,112] re-
ported that the value of the discharge coefficient depends on both
internal geometry and diameter of a nozzle which can alter the mo-
mentum flux ratio, q, up to 50% for a nozzle with a length to diameter
ratio of 4. Ahn et al. [80,113] reported that liquid column trajecto-
ry of non-cavitating and cavitating jets has a similar trend, but
different from liquid column trajectory of hydraulic flip jets because
the surface of hydraulic flip liquid jet flow detaches from the inner
wall of the orifice hole. Lubarsky et al. [92] investigated spray tra-
jectories formed by Jet-A fuel injected into a cross airflow using
different injector geometries (sharp edge with L/dj = 10, and round
edge with L/dj ~ 1). They reported that the discharge coefficient of
a sharp edged orifice is relatively constant, Cd ~ 0.75, within their
tested range of Rej number, while the discharge coefficient of a round
edged orifice is Cd ~ 0.96 for Reynolds numbers exceeding
Re j = 10 000
. They indicated higher spray penetration into a cross
airflow (~12%) for a sharp edged orifice compared with a round

with the empirical correlations of Wu et al. [27], but with an ad-
justed drag coefficient based on the breakup regimes from the
measurement of Sallam et al. [29]. Xiao et al. [72] employed the same
approach (i.e., CLSVOF) to predict the trajectory of a liquid jet in a
cross airflow. There exist some studies which employed a Lagran-
gian approach (or particle tracking method) to predict liquid jet
trajectory based on modeling the breakup of droplets (instead of
a liquid column) injected into a cross airflow [35,36,101–103], fol-
lowing the study of Liu et al. [104], who studied the injection of
droplets into a cross airflow. Several theoretical analyses are per-
formed in order to predict liquid jet trajectory by taking into account
the forces exerted on a liquid jet [13,75,105–111]. Wang et al. [24],
in a recent publication, carried out a statistical analysis of pub-
lished correlations to determine the minimum average standard
deviations of their predictions of a transverse liquid jet trajectory.
Optimum values of the coefficients/exponents of a more general form
of correlation were suggested for predicting the trajectory of a trans-
verse liquid jet over a wide range of test conditions.

3.3. Concluding remarks on liquid jet trajectory and penetration

The correlations presented above exhibited discrepancies in the
prediction of the trajectory and penetration of a liquid jet in a
crossflow. This is attributed to a variety of different factors such as
errors and uncertainties in experiments and measurement methods
as well as other factors. However, these differences can be nar-
rowed down if correlations are categorized/regrouped based on
factors pertaining to the problem and its own test conditions. For
instance, different approaches (experimental [31], statistical [24],
and analytical [111]) showed the inadequacy of using solely q for
predicting the trajectory of a liquid jet in a crossflow particularly
at elevated pressure and/or temperature conditions. That is why the
effect of other dimensionless group numbers, such as jet Weber
number Wej = qWeg, jet Reynolds number Rej, gas (crossflow) Reyn-
olds number Reg, Ohnesorge number, Oh, Bond number Bo, gas to
liquid density ratio ρj/ρg, and gas to liquid viscosity ratio μj/μg, should
be accounted for depending on the degree of their contributions
and interdependency. For instance, changing temperature will change
air crossflow properties. Therefore, choosing simultaneously both
temperature ratio and a non-dimensional number based on air prop-
erties may not represent the independent effect of each parameter.
This is the reason why, for example, the exponent of temperature

edged orifice. They attributed this observation to a larger droplet
size generated by a sharp injector and, possibly by the higher ve-
locity of some droplets. Therefore, the jet velocity, calculated based
on the metered nozzle flowrate divided by a nozzle exit area (i.e.,
discharge coefficient = 1), should be normalized by an actual noz-
zle’s discharge coefficient (i.e., discharge coefficient < 1) in order to
render the injection velocity independent of nozzle’s geometry and
determine the jet actual velocity required for calculating q Re We
.

While the focus of the present review paper is on non-evaporating
liquid jets, it is worth mentioning that Prakash et al. [64] studied
the penetration of a highly volatile liquid fuel (ethanol) jet at el-
evated temperature test conditions and observed a higher trajectory
than that at standard conditions, which they attributed to the effect
of liquid vaporization.

4. Liquid jet breakup (fracture) length

As discussed earlier (Subsection 1.2), there are two modes of
liquid jet breakup processes, namely column and surface breakup.
The core of a transverse liquid jet (i.e., liquid column) forms a con-
tinuous stream between the jet exit and the location (point) of its
complete fracture (i.e., column breakup point). Knowledge of the
location of column breakup point is important for, for example, mod-
eling a liquid jet in a crossflow. Accurate determination of this
location is difficult because of high droplets density around the jet
column. That is why there exist discrepancies among the predic-
tions of this length in published literature. Similar to the trajectory
and penetration of transverse liquid jet (presented in Section 3), this
feature has been presented in published literature using different
expressions which correlated the breakup length with different non-
dimensional numbers or a constant. Column breakup length of a
transverse liquid jet is defined as the streamwise distance it travels
into a crossflow before its complete breakup, which is referred to
as the column breakup distance (i.e., x-axis direction in Fig. 2) and
column breakup height (i.e., z-axis direction, as shown in Fig. 2), re-
spectively. Published correlations of liquid jet breakup length are
categorized and discussed below.

4.1. Column breakup (fracture) distance

.

.

j =

The majority of published correlations for predicting the column
breakup distance related the non-dimensional form of this dis-
tance (i.e., normalized by the jet diameter, xb/dj) to a constant. This
suggests that the column breakup distance is insensitive to gaseous
or liquid phase properties. For instance, Inamura et al. [114] found
xb/dj to be in the range of 3.0–3.5. However, Wu et al. [27] pro-
±
posed a larger value for a transverse liquid jet as x db
8 06 1 46
.
Becker and Hassa [37], who investigated the effect of elevated pres-
sure on a transverse liquid jet, reported xb/dj ≈ 8. Sallam et al. [29]
experimentally investigated this distance for a non-turbulent round
liquid jet and found xb/dj = 8. Tambe et al. [41] defined this dis-
tance as the mean location of the formation of the first ligament,
with a mean value of 14.97 and a standard deviation of 1.37. Ahn
et al. [80] measured this distance for noncavitating flows as
x db
, while they asserted that, in cavitating flows, as
the injection differential pressure increases, cavitation develops and
liquid jet becomes turbulent, which leads to a shorter column
breakup distance. Iyogun et al. [81], and Birouk et al. [83], re-
ported this distance as xb/dj ≈ 12. The measurements of Lee et al.
[65] yielded x db
for, respectively, turbu-
lent and nonturbulent liquid jets in a crossflow. Xiao et al. [72]
adopted a Coupled Level Set and Volume Of Fluid (CLSVOF) simu-
lation approach for both turbulent and nonturbulent liquid jets. In
agreement with the experiment results of Lee et al. [65], they re-
ported a shorter breakup distance of a turbulent liquid jet than that
of a nonturbulent jet at the same gas Weber number. Gopala et al.

[115] reported a shorter distance compared to Wu et al. [27], and
Sallam et al. [29], and attributed this discrepancy to the technique
that they used in comparison with the shadowgraphy or Mie scat-
tering techniques commonly employed. Osta et al. [60] measured
the column breakup distance of a turbulent liquid jet by consider-
ing nozzles with different length/diameter ratio. They showed that
the column breakup distance of a turbulent liquid jet with differ-
ent length/diameter ratio ranges between the two constant values

et al. [29] for nonturbulent liquid jets; i.e., x db

are as follows: x db
Birouk et al. [44] experimentally showed that at lower liquid vis-
cosity, up to approximately 0.029 Pa·s, the liquid breakup distance
exhibited a tendency to be almost constant corroborating earlier
published findings. However, at higher liquid viscosity, up to
0.058 Pa·s, they reported that liquid jet breakup distance in-
creased with increasing q, and became dependent on the liquid
viscosity where its effect was accounted for using Oh. They, there-
fore, proposed two empirical correlations for the liquid breakup

parameters, air viscosity might also play a role (though quite

ratio can cause a reduction of the height of the liquid column breakup
location. Xiao et al. [72] showed numerically that the breakup dis-
tance decreases as the gas Weber number increases for a
nonturbulent liquid jet. The aforementioned numerical and exper-
imental studies demonstrated the importance of test conditions and
their consequent effects on liquid and gas properties (or in other
words, on non-dimensional parameters) and hence on the predic-
tion of the column breakup location.

becomes even smaller (<8) when (i) instabilities are present on the
liquid jet surface caused by cavitation or (ii) the transition from
laminar to turbulent jet flow regime occurs earlier. On the other
hand, this distance can increase with viscosity for viscous liquids.
Furthermore, different parameters, such as the change of gas prop-
erties at high temperature and pressure test conditions, injection
angle and measurement methods, can all affect this distance, and
make it dependent on different nondimensional parameters.

While the majority of correlations of the column breakup dis-
tance predict a constant value, the correlations of the column
breakup height are mostly expressed in a nondimensional form. For
instance, Inamura et al. [114] found that the liquid breakup height
depends on q, but did not propose a correlation. Wu et al. [27] used
a phenomenological approach to propose two correlations for the
. , and
column breakup height; one theoretical as z d
another empirical as z d
q
. Similar to Inamura et al. [114]
and Wu et al. [27], Tambe et al. [41] reported that the liquid breakup
height increased with q, but no correlation was proposed. Ahn et al.
[80] asserted that for noncavitating flows, the breakup length of a
liquid jet followed well the results of Wu et al. [27]. However, for
cavitating flows, the liquid breakup height had a smaller value,
similar to the x-directional breakup distance discussed previously
(Subsection 4.1). Osta et al. [60] measured the column breakup height
of a turbulent liquid jet by considering nozzles with different length/
diameter ratios, and proposed an empirical correlation for each

study reported that when a liquid is injected into a wind tunnel’s
crossflow, liquid jet must cross the wall boundary layer. This con-
sequently causes a delay in its breakup time, and hence yields a
shorter liquid column in comparison with that of a jet injected into
a shock-tube test facility which has a much thinner boundary layer.
Thawley et al. [85] and Wang et al. [86] reported the following cor-
relation for the liquid breakup height z d
. Zheng and
Marshall [66] used a nozzle with a length/diameter ratio larger than
20 to achieve a fully developed turbulent velocity profile, and re-

ported two different correlations for the liquid breakup height with

respect to gas Weber number as follows: z d

Birouk et al. [44] reported that, for high liquid viscosity, similar
to the breakup distance, the liquid breakup height exhibited de-
pendence on liquid viscosity in addition to q. However, their criterion
for defining the low and high viscosity regions changed from
0.029 to 0.019 Pa s. They provided two correlations for the liquid

Bellofiore et al. [9] examined high temperature and pressure
(HTP) test conditions and proposed a correlation for the liquid
breakup height as a function of q and Reg, which accounted for
both air density and viscosity effect on jet penetration, as
follows: z d
. Ragucci et al. [90] stated that
the liquid breakup height of a transverse liquid jet at high
pressure test conditions, similar to their correlation for liquid
breakup distance, is a function of q and Weaero and expressed as
z d
. However, liquid breakup height is
b
more sensitive to q and less sensitive to Weaero in comparison
with the liquid breakup distance correlation. Ragucci et al. [94],
then, included air viscosity effect to predict the liquid breakup
height at HTP test conditions with their correlation expressed
as z d
, where the breakup
height is more sensitive to air viscosity compared to the breakup
distance.

4.3. Concluding remarks on liquid jet breakup (fracture) length

5. Droplets features and formation mechanisms

Based on published literature, it appears that liquid breakup dis-
tance can mostly be predicted by a constant value, and the liquid
breakup height is correlated with q. However, these correlations show
some degree of discrepancies in predicting the breakup length,
similar to the trajectory and penetration correlations discussed in
Section 3, due to different reasons such as difficulties in observing
the breakup location obstructed by the high droplet density around
the jet column, errors and uncertainties associated with experi-
ments and measurement methods, etc. Similar to the trajectory and
penetration correlations (see Section 3), these differences can be nar-
rowed down and the correlations can be employed appropriately
provided that one considers the prevailing parameters. For in-
stance, Ahn et al. [80], Lee et al. [65], Osta et al. [60] and Birouk et al.
[118] stated that the presence of cavitation and turbulence en-
hances the process of liquid column breakup as a whole, and
consequently shortens the column breakup time and length of a tur-
bulent liquid jet in a crossflow when compared with a nonturbulent
liquid jet. Moreover, Birouk et al. [44] stated that, for high viscous
liquids, the breakup length should be correlated to Oh in addition
to q. Bellofiore et al. [9] and Ragucci et al. [90,94] also showed that,
for high temperature and pressure test conditions, in addition to
q, nondimensional parameters such as Weaero should be taken into
account for correlating liquid breakup length. According to Fuller
et al. [57], Costa et al. [116] and Kim et al. [117], for angled jet in-
jections, the breakup length can be predicted by accounting for the
effect of different nondimensional numbers which include q and Wej
in addition to the injection angle θ. Overall, column breakup dis-
j = −8 12,
tance can be approximated by a constant ranging as x db

employed a Coupled Level Set and Volume Of Fluid (CLSVOF) sim-
ulation integrated with Lagrangian method, revealed that the
calculated breakup location is slightly smaller than that reported
experimentally [27,29]. They attributed this difference to the fact
that experimental studies used only one view (a single plane) for
determining the breakup location, which can be affected by the ob-
trusion of neighboring liquid structures. Further studies are required

The breakup of a liquid jet involves two sequential processes:
primary and secondary breakup [119]. For a liquid jet injected into
a subsonic cross airflow, as is depicted in Fig. 2, the primary breakup
is governed by two mechanisms: column and surface breakup. Liga-
ments and droplets disintegrating from liquid column, via the
primary breakup, undergo secondary breakup mechanism leading
to smaller droplets, and consequently the formation of a spray in
the far-field region. Since the features of droplets and their forma-
tion mechanisms are different in the near- and far-field regions of
a liquid jet in a subsonic crossflow, they will be discussed sepa-
rately in the following sections.

5.1. Liquid jet’s near-field region

Formation of droplets in the near-field region as a result of the
primary breakup of a liquid jet is the process which determines the
initial properties of the spray dispersed phase in the far-field region
and consequently plays a key role in defining the secondary breakup,
droplets interactions and fuel/air mixing rate. On the other hand,
factors such as secondary breakup and droplets interactions in the
far-field may overrule the outcome of the primary breakup. The focus
of this section, therefore, is on the size and velocity distribution,
as well as the formation rate of droplets generated along the liquid
column surface. This is important in order to achieve better under-
stating of the underlying physics of liquid jet primary breakup. As
was explained earlier in Section 1.2 (features of a liquid jet in a sub-
sonic gaseous crossflow), two mechanisms have been proposed for
droplets formation along a liquid column jet injected into a cross
airflow; namely: hydrodynamic instability and boundary layer strip-
ping (BLS) mechanism in the near-nozzle’s cross-section of a liquid
jet, as illustrated schematically in Fig. 23.

As is shown in Fig. 23(a), hydrodynamic instability analysis pos-
tulates that the temporal growth of azimuthal instabilities (shear
instabilities) is responsible for the formation of interface corruga-
tions, which eventually shears off the jet surface [26,120–122]. The
analysis is based on a continuous formulation of the momentum
equations in which the jet and cross-flow are considered to be

mission from Cambridge University Press).

slightly miscible at the vicinity of the interface. This method sup-
ports an inviscid breakup mechanism which is opposed to the
boundary layer stripping analysis where the liquid viscosity plays
a key role. During the injection of a liquid jet into a cross airflow,
there exists another form of instability (axial instability) that de-
velops on the jet windward surface farther away from the nozzle,
which is responsible for the column breakup process [26,120–122].
The reader can find more detail about the application of the sta-
bility analysis for a jet injected into a quiescent atmosphere or
crossflow elsewhere [14,15,74,123–125].

As for the boundary layer stripping perspective, as is illus-
trated in Fig. 23(b), a viscous boundary layer is assumed to form at
the jet periphery due to the existence of shear forces between the
gaseous and liquid phases. Eventually, liquid droplets disintegrate
off the boundary layer which is formed inside the liquid jet due to
the influence of the outer airflow. The diameter of the formed drop-
lets is comparable to the thickness of the liquid boundary layer
[29,126]. While the former analysis has only been recently pro-
posed [26,122], the latter has been widely employed in order to
develop semi-empirical correlations for the size, velocity and for-
mation rate of droplets produced from the surface breakup of a
nonturbulent [29,45,58,126] and a turbulent [58,60,61,65] liquid jet
in a cross airflow. Therefore, they will be discussed in details for
both non-turbulent and turbulent liquid jets in the following
subsections.

5.1.1. Droplets formation from nonturbulent liquid jet

The formation of ligaments and droplets along a liquid surface
of a nonturbulent liquid jet in a cross airflow has been studied in
the literature [29,45,58,126]. Sallam et al. [29] asserted that, within
the shear breakup regime, the appearance of drops always pre-
cedes by the appearance of ligaments protruding downstream from
the region near the sides of liquid jet towards the wake region. In
order to find the size of droplets along the liquid jet surface, they
proposed a correlation for the size of ligaments, and then pre-
dicted the size of droplets by taking into account Rayleigh breakup
of drops at the end of ligaments. Sallam et al. [29] exploited an
analogy between the primary breakup of a liquid jet in a cross
airflow, and the primary breakup of a liquid jet in a still gas [127]
for ligaments and drops formation. By equating the momentum flux
(relative to the bulk of liquid jet) of a ligament with a given size,
dli , to the maximum surface tension force required to start the for-
mation of a ligament with such a size, they proposed two semi-
empirical correlations for the ligaments diameter at the onset of
ligament formation as follows:

They suggested a constant ratio of drops diameter, dpi , to liga-

(5)

Sallam et al. [29] associated the diameter of ligaments along the
liquid jet surface, dl, to the thickness of the liquid jet boundary layer
caused by the cross airflow. Proceeding in the same manner as Chou
et al. [128], Sallam et al. [29] identified two regimes for ligaments
formation along the liquid jet surface and the variation of their di-
ameter as a function of liquid jet streamwise distance, z; namely:
transient and quasi-steady regimes. The transient regime is asso-
ciated with the progressive growth of the boundary layer as a
function of time (or with increasing z) which supplies liquid to the
base of ligaments. They proposed a semi-empirical correlation for
the ligaments diameter as follows [29]:

For the quasi-steady regime, Sallam et al. [29] assumed that the
boundary layer reaches its maximum possible growth of a thick-
ness which is a fixed fraction of the liquid jet diameter. They
proposed the following correlation for this regime:

In both regimes of ligaments growth, the diameter of drops, dp,

ligaments diameter based on the Rayleigh breakup mechanism,
which is expressed as follows:

The velocity of droplets, disintegrated from the surface of non-
turbulent liquid jet in a cross airflow within the conditions of shear
breakup regime, has also been measured in the dense spray region
[29]. Sallam et al. [29] performed measurements close to the tip of
ligaments to minimize the effect of drops velocity relaxation to the
ambient velocity, and proposed two correlations for the compo-
nents of drops velocity in the liquid jet streamwise direction, vp, and
cross airflow direction, up, as follows [29]:

They revealed that drops velocity after breakup is nearly inde-
pendent of drops diameter. They, however, indicated that the gas-
phase drag during the breakup process affected drops velocity
[29]. This consequently caused vp component to become slightly
smaller than the jet velocity (see Eq. 9), and up component to
significantly grow higher than that of crossflow velocity (Eq. 10)
[29]. It is worth noticing that Li et al. [129], and Li and Soteriou
[71] employed a Eulerian approach to carry out a high fidelity
Coupled Level Set and Volume Of Fluid (CLSVOF) simulation in
order to directly capture liquid–gas interface involving topological
changes. Following the study of Herrmann [98,99], Li and Soteriou
[71] integrated their simulation with Lagrangian method for small
drops, and compared their results concerning the size and veloci-
ty of droplets as well as other characteristics of a liquid jet in a
cross airflow with their counterparts’ experimental data of Sallam
et al. [29]. Li and Soteriou [71] reported a similar up component
probability distribution, though with a peak value of around 12,
which is larger than that in Eq. (10). This discrepancy was attrib-
uted to the large uncertainties in determining droplets velocity
using two-dimensional images. Li and Soteriou [71] also calcu-
lated the peak value of vp distribution and found it to range from
0.5 to 0.6, which is in reasonable agreement with the value of 0.7
in Eq. (9). They revealed that the jet transverse velocity (i.e., the
third component of droplets velocity in y-direction according to
Fig. 1) is very small, suggesting that the majority of droplets travel
transversally.

Ng et al. [45] measured droplets size distribution disintegrated
from a non-turbulent liquid jet in a cross airflow at the conditions
of bag breakup regime. They revealed that the bag breakup re-
sulted in three distinctive droplets sizes as follows: (a) very small
droplets due to the breakup of the bag membrane, (b) small drop-
lets due to the breakup of the two strings of the ring, and (c) large
droplets associated with the nodes. They observed that the size of
bag-droplets, defined by Sauter Mean Diameter (SMD or d32 ), is in-
dependent of the gas Weber number, Weg, and represented by the
following relation:

and two correlations for the components of ring-droplets velocity

as well as two correlations for the components of bag-droplets ve-

direction, ubag, as follows:

Ng et al. [45] observed that the bag-droplets, immediately after
breakup, travel with a higher cross-stream velocity but with a
lower jet streamwise velocity than the node- and the ring-droplets
due to the high pressure produced by the stagnating gas on the
upwind side of the bags that upon the bursting of their mem-
branes propels the bag-droplets in the direction of cross airflow. The
bag-droplets then travel into a separate trajectory than the rela-
tively larger node- and ring-droplets.

In addition to droplets size and velocity, droplets formation
rate has also been studied in order to completely describe the
process of droplets formation. For instance, Sallam et al. [29],
inspired by their earlier studies on turbulent primary breakup of
a liquid jet in still gas [127], determined the mass flux of droplets
leaving the liquid column by measuring the volume (and hence
the mass) of the generated droplets per unit of jet-projected area
and unit time for shear breakup regime using double-pulse holo-
grams. They considered only the downstream half of the liquid
column as opposed to the entire periphery of a turbulent liquid
jet in still gas. They defined a liquid surface breakup efficiency
factor, ε, as follows:

Nonetheless, they reported that the sizes of the node- and the

Ng et al. [45] measured also droplets velocity right after the bag
breakup of a non-turbulent liquid jet in a cross airflow, and re-
vealed that droplets velocity is independent of their size. They
proposed two correlations for the components of node-droplets ve-
locity in the liquid jet streamwise direction, vnode , and cross airflow
direction, unode , as follows:

v

(14)

where (cid:3)m f
′′ is the average mass flux of liquid drops leaving the liquid
column, and up is obtained from Eq. (10). They mentioned that, al-
though the limits of ε are between 0 for the onset of drop formation,
and 1 for conditions where liquid drops form in a continuous manner
over all the downstream liquid projected area, the actual appear-
ance of liquid surface during a non-turbulent primary shear breakup,
and particularly as the result of Rayleigh breakup at the tip of the
growing ligaments along the surface, suggests that ε is generally less
than unity. Employing the dimensionless liquid jet streamwise length
z/zb between the jet exit and conditions where the liquid column
breaks up as a whole, Sallam et al. [29] proposed a correlation for
ε as follows:

Li and Soteriou [71] numerically investigated the drops forma-
tion rate of a liquid jet injected into a crossflow for different Weg
and reported a similar ε profile to that experimentally found by
Sallam et al. [29]. However, they observed a shift in the profile when

24

varying Weg, which is attributed to the difference in the definition
of the projected area compared with that of Sallam et al. [29]. It is
worth mentioning that Li and Soteriou [71] reported that, in con-
trast to the case of Weg = 40 and Weg = 160, the case of Weg = 10 has
lower breakup efficiency due to the dominant role of column breakup
compared to surface breakup at Weg = 10. However, this numeri-
cal finding needs to be confirmed experimentally.

Overall, based on published studies reviewed in this section, it
is shown that, in the shear breakup regime, the ratio of drops
diameter to ligaments diameter is a fixed value under Rayleigh
breakup mechanism (Eqs. 5 and 8). The ligaments diameter at the
onset of ligaments formation is a function of Weg (Eq. 3), whereas
the ligaments diameter along the column surface depends on vj
(Eq. 6). In both cases, liquid and gas properties and jet diameter
are of importance in defining the ligaments diameter. The liga-
ments diameter along the column surface (Eq. 6) depends also on
z, which shows that larger size ligaments, and consequently larger
drops are formed in the liquid jet streamwise direction. Further-
more, droplets formation rate can be correlated by a dimensionless
length along the liquid column (Eq. 21). In the bag breakup
regime, the size distribution of drops shows different trends. The
size of bag-droplets diameter is independent of Weg and is a fixed
fraction of jet exit diameter (Eq. 11), whereas the sizes of the
node- and the ring-droplets decrease with increasing Weg (Eqs. 12
and 13). Droplets velocity after breakup is independent of its
diameter for both breakup (bag and shear breakup) regimes.
Features of droplets disintegrated along a nonturbulent liquid
column in a cross airflow have been obtained experimentally by
Sallam and co-workers [29,45,58,126] for the both breakup regimes,
and numerically by Li et al. [129], and Li and Soteriou [71] for just
the shear breakup regime. In addition, Sallam and co-workers
[29,45,58,126] examined the effect of a supercavitating nozzle
with a sharp-edged inlet and exit on liquid jet exit conditions
(cavitation and hydraulic flip). However, the effect of round-edged
nozzles on the features of droplets generated during the primary
breakup over the surface of liquid column is still lacking and
needs to be investigated. Therefore, more numerical and experi-
mental studies are needed to shed more light on the features of
droplets of a nonturbulent liquid jet.

5.1.2. Droplets formation from a turbulent liquid jet

Semi-empirical correlations are proposed for the variation of liga-
ments diameter, dl, as a function of the distance from the jet exit,
z [58,60,61,65]. The effect of turbulent primary breakup on a liquid
jet injected into a cross airflow is accounted for by following the
approach of Sallam and Faeth [127] for a liquid injected into a still
gas as follows [65]:

where We
(i.e., cross-stream) integral length scale Λ. Lee et al. [65] demon-
strated that ligaments properties are clearly dominated by liquid
turbulence, while cross airflow has no noticeable effect for Weg < 300.
Based on Rayleigh breakup of ligaments (similar to a non-
turbulent liquid jet injected into a cross airflow), Lee et al. [65]
assumed that the SMD of drops formed by ligaments breakup is pro-
portional to the corresponding ligaments diameter, and proposed
the following correlation for the size of droplets after the turbu-
lent primary breakup.

Following the aforementioned studies of turbulent liquid jet, Osta
and Sallam [60] studied the effect of nozzle geometry (length/
diameter ratio, L/dj, and the inlet curvature, R/dj) on the ligaments
diameter along the upwind surface of a liquid jet and reported that
longer L/dj nozzle produces larger-sized ligaments. They proposed
a correlation which has the following form:

where C1 and C2 were obtained experimentally and found to depend

The velocity of droplets disintegrated from liquid jet surface as
a result of the turbulent primary breakup is reported in several pub-
lished studies [58,60,61,65]. Similar to Sallam et al. [29], Lee et al.
[65] performed measurements closer to the ligaments tip in order
to minimize the effect of droplet velocity relaxation to the ambient
velocity. Two correlations for the components of drops velocity in
the liquid jet streamwise direction, vp, and cross airflow direction,
up, are proposed [65] as follows:

Lee et al. [65] asserted that, similar to the findings of Sallam et al.
[29] for a non-turbulent liquid jet, the effect of cross airflow causes
vp component to decrease below the jet velocity (see Eq. 25), and
up component to increase significantly above crossflow velocity (see
Eq. 26). Following the approach of Sallam et al. [29] for finding drop-
lets formation rate of a non-turbulent liquid jet in a cross airflow,
Lee et al. [65] measured the flux of liquid drops due to turbulent
primary breakup along the liquid surface and proposed a correla-
tion for surface efficiency factor, ε, as follows:

(27)

It should be noted that in order for Lee et al. [65] to compare
their results with those of Sallam et al. [29], they employed (Eq. 27)
a non-turbulent breakup length (zb similar to Eq. 21) instead of the
turbulent breakup length which is shorter [65]. They reported that
their measured ε for a round liquid jet agrees well with earlier results
of non-turbulent liquid jet [29], with a smaller value of ε at the onset
of breakup but approaches unity towards the end of the liquid
column. However, they demonstrated that ε started at a smaller z/zb
for a turbulent liquid jet compared to a non-turbulent jet. This is
because turbulence precipitates the onset of breakup of a turbu-
lent liquid jet closer to the jet exit.

The literature reviewed above revealed that the diameter of liga-
ments and droplets generated along the liquid column is a function
of vj, liquid properties, integral length scale of the flow field and
jet diameter (Eqs. 22 and 23). It also depends on z where for a tur-
bulent liquid jet in a cross airflow, similar to a nonturbulent jet, larger
size ligaments and drops form as the distance from the nozzle exit
increases in the liquid jet streamwise direction. Furthermore, similar
to a nonturbulent jet, droplets velocity after breakup is indepen-
dent of diameter for turbulent breakup regime (Eqs. 25 and 26).
Similarly, droplets formation rate can be correlated with the di-
mensionless length along the liquid column (Eq. 27), but with a
higher rate compared to that of nonturbulent breakup owing to the
effect of turbulence. Similar to a nonturbulent jet, details about the
features of droplets disintegrated along a turbulent liquid column

in a cross airflow have been obtained experimentally by Sallam and
co-workers [58,60,61,65]. Finally, although features of droplets from
a turbulent liquid jet have been documented experimentally using
two-dimensional images, three-dimensional high-fidelity simula-
tions are still required.

5.2. Liquid jet’s far-field region

Droplets generated via secondary breakup are of great impor-
tance to the process of liquid fuel atomization. It is important to
mention that although a well distributed and finely dispersed
spray in the far-field region is often desired in the majority of
engineering applications (e.g., [130]), a non-uniform droplets dis-
tribution is also advantageous in some other applications (e.g.,
[131]).

Experimental measurements of droplets size distribution down-
stream of the liquid column showed its dependency on the velocity
of cross airflow, ug [35,37,40,41,50,73,130,132–137]. Gas Weber
number, Weg, is used in different studies [40,135–137] to account
for the effect of both gas inertia and liquid surface tension. Several
studies examined the distribution of droplets as a function of the
jet downstream location in addition to gas Weber number. These
studies [40,135–137] asserted that, in general, at low Weg (i.e., where
the dominant primary breakup mode is column breakup), drop-
lets size reaches its maximum at the outer periphery of spray plume
where larger droplets prevail. This is attributed to their higher mo-
mentum and longer velocity relaxation time which consequently
make them penetrate farther into cross airflow. At high Weg (i.e.,
where the surface breakup tends to be dominant), however, drop-
lets size reaches its maximum in the core region as even larger
droplets cannot penetrate farther down due to greater aerody-
namic force of cross airflow. In essence, surface breakup produces
smaller droplets during the primary breakup, as opposed to drop-
lets generated by column breakup process which easily follow cross
airflow. Nonetheless, Lubarsky et al. [137] showed a double peak
distribution of droplets size downstream of a liquid jet at low Weg
(Weg ~ 33), which suggest the existence of a multimode breakup
process.

Ingebo and Foster [132], and Ingebo [133] are the first to de-
scribe the effect of column wavelength on droplets features. They
observed that short wave-length disturbances near the nozzle exit
produce relatively small droplets, whereas long wave-length dis-
turbances farther down in a cross airflow produce relatively large
droplets. Ingebo [132,133] correlated drops mean size, defined by
Sauter Mean Diameter (SMD or d32 ), with gas Weber, Reynolds
number, and a pressure sensitive dimensionless group gl/c2 (where
g is the acceleration due to gravity, l is the mean free molecular
path, and c stands for root-mean-square molecular velocity). None-
theless, Less and Schetz [134] asserted that since Ingebo and Foster
[132] tested only high momentum flux ratio, q, conditions, drop-
lets’ mean diameter is determined independently of q and vj.
Consequently, Less and Schetz [134] included vj in their proposed
relation of SMD (see Table 8). Similarly, Tambe et al. [41] reported
that surface breakup intensifies with increasing q, which in turn
results in smaller SMD. Becker and Hassa [37] reported that the
influence of cross airflow velocity is much weaker at high pressure

than at atmospheric test conditions, which implies a lack of a strong
correlation between droplets size and Weg at high pressure test
conditions. Farvardin et al. [73] studied the effect of liquid viscos-
ity on droplets size downstream of a nozzle with a diameter of
0.5 mm and reported that droplets size distribution attained sim-
ilarity at 50 mm, which is attributed to the fact that droplets become
very fine at this flow location and hence not subjected to further
secondary breakup. Song et al. [50] employed Weg, the ratio of Rej/
Reg (or q), and liquid/gas density and viscosity ratio to account for
the surroundings air pressure and liquid properties in order to
develop a relation for predicting the mean size of drops/spray. Pub-
lished correlations of the mean diameter of droplets in the far-
field region for a liquid jet injected into a subsonic cross airflow
are summarized in Table 8.

There exist two factors which affect droplets velocity distribu-
tion downstream of a liquid jet injected into a cross airflow. The
first one is the flow wake region caused by the presence of liquid
column, and the second is the droplets size. The interplay between
these two factors defines the distribution of droplets velocity [102].
Regarding the first factor, several studies reported a lower-velocity
region in the spray wake behind the liquid jet but peaks at the outer
and inner peripheries of the jet [41,73,135,136,138]. The wake region,
hence, is used as an indication of the level of momentum ex-
change between liquid column and cross airflow [136]. Mashayek
et al. [102] stated that the effect of liquid column on the flow di-
minishes with increasing liquid jet streamwise distance, z, due to
the column breakup. This, therefore, leads to a more direct mo-
mentum exchange between droplets and the cross airflow, and thus
the acceleration of droplets. As for the second factor (droplets size),
the size and velocity profiles generally show that (see, e.g., [102])
the larger are the droplets, the slower they move downstream. For
instance, Pontus et al. [130] depicted a relationship between drop-
lets size and velocity at several planes downstream of the nozzle
exit into cross airflow. They reported that larger droplets exhib-
ited slower velocity, and the velocity–size relationship seemed to
be fully established farther downstream into a cross airflow. Similar
to size distribution, droplets velocity downstream of a liquid jet in
a cross airflow is a function of ug (or Weg) [41,135–137]. Elshamy
et al. [138] attributed the variation in the velocity distribution of
droplets to the change of Weg. In fact, liquid jet breakup regime shifts
from column to surface breakup as Weg increases. This results in the
variation of the size and velocity distribution of droplets. Lubarsky
et al. [137] studied droplets velocity components at different Weg.
They reported that the velocity of droplets in the cross airflow
streamwise direction showed a considerable lag with respect to the
incoming airflow’s mean velocity, especially within the core of spray.
They noted that the absolute value of the velocity lag is directly pro-
portional to Weg. This observation is confirmed by Mashayek et al.
[102] who asserted that it takes longer distance for droplets to merge
into the gas stream velocity for larger ug. The findings of Lubarsky
et al. [137] also corroborate previous studies, in that larger drop-
lets form at low Weg and penetrate farther away from the nozzle
exit with a higher liquid jet streamwise velocity; while smaller drop-
lets form at high Weg and closely follow the jet flow within the core
of spray and then shift back towards the nozzle exit as spray bends
due to vortex flow.

The momentum flux, q, plays a key role on the velocity distri-
bution of the secondary droplets downstream of a liquid jet where
it is a dominant factor in defining the deflection, penetration and
disintegration height of a liquid jet in a cross airflow [102]. Inamura
et al. [135] asserted that the minimum droplets velocity de-
creases with increasing q. This might be due to the increase in the
level of the momentum exchange between liquid column and cross
airflow (larger wake region), as Inamura et al. [135] mentioned that
the location where droplets velocity reaches its minimum resides
farther away from the nozzle exit in the liquid jet streamwise di-
rection. Inamura et al. [135] indicated that the minimum droplets
velocity increases rapidly downstream of the nozzle exit which con-
sequently leads to a more uniform distribution of droplets velocity;
whereas it is less uniform in the vicinity of the liquid nozzle exit.
Mashayek et al. [102] also observed the same behavior and noted
that the velocity profile of droplets velocity becomes more uniform
farther down into the cross airflow streamwise direction. Elshamy
et al. [138] examined the effect of the pressure of cross airflow and
reported that, for lower Stokes number (this number determines
how quickly droplets can respond to the change in the surround-
ings air velocity), droplets follow airstream more quickly and more
closely. Elshamy et al. [138] found that the Stokes number of a
droplet is inversely proportional to the square root of the air density
(pressure), and thus the droplets normalized velocity has more
uniform distribution at higher ambient pressures. Farvardin et al.
[73] examined experimentally the effect of liquid viscosity on drop-
lets velocity and reported an increased jet bending in the near-
field region (liquid column) due to an increase in liquid viscosity
which results in less momentum residue for carrying droplets, and
hence a decrease in the velocity of droplets. Farvardin and Dolatabadi
[97], via a Eulerian approach, coupled Large Eddy Simulation (LES)
with a Volume Of Fluid (VOF) simulation and reported the same
downward trends of droplets velocity with increasing liquid viscosity.
Several numerical simulation studies were performed to gain
knowledge on droplets features in the far-field region. For instance,
Khosla et al. [139] used a Eulerian approach to develop an atomiza-
tion model for liquid jet in a crossflow using a high fidelity Volume
Of Fluid (VOF) simulation. They developed several expressions of size,
velocity and mass flux of droplets generated via the primary breakup,
and also size and mass shedding of droplets due to the secondary
breakup. They validated their numerical simulation of volume flux
and SMD of droplets in the far-field region using the experimental
data reported in [37,136]. Liu et al. [104] employed a Lagrangian ap-
proach to model the breakup of the injection of a single droplet in
a cross airflow. In another investigation, Liu et al. [140] employed a
Lagrangian approach to examine the effect of cross airflow on the be-
havior of a liquid jet where they considered the injection of successive
droplets into a cross airflow and employed a modified drop drag co-
efficient. Their numerical drops size distribution showed a qualitative
agreement with the experimental results of Kihm et al. [40]. Similar
approach has been adopted in the literature to predict droplets fea-
tures in the far-field region (e.g., [34–36,101,102,141]). These numerical
studies were able to qualitatively capture the main spray features such
as droplets size and velocity distribution by employing submodels
for droplets stripping including Taylor analogy breakup (TAB), bound-
ary layer stripping (BLS), Rayleigh–Taylor, and Kelvin–Helmholtz (K-
H) wave model. A summary of the models developed in these studies
is available in Reference [102].

Overall, these reviewed studies above showed that Weg, q, and
liquid/gas properties are important for predicting droplets features/
characteristics in the far-field region. Liquid jet breakup regime can
change with Weg, and hence droplets size and velocity. Increasing
q has two distinct effects on the size of droplets; it can change the
breakup regime (see Fig. 3), or increase the column breakup height
(see Section 4.2). This consequently results in an increased length
of the liquid column and hence the generation of finer drops via

surface breakup. q affects droplets velocity, as it has direct effect on
the mode of breakup regime and also the wake region and hence
the momentum exchange between the cross airflow and droplets.
Clearly additional high fidelity simulations are needed to shed more
light on the effect of, for example, gas and liquid properties on drop-
lets features/characteristics in the far-field.

5.3. Concluding remarks on droplets features and formation
mechanisms

It is concluded that the characteristics of droplets disintegrated
during the primary breakup are not significantly affected by the ve-
locity of cross airflow. However, they are influenced by the nozzle
exit conditions such as turbulence. On the other hand, further studies
are needed to unravel the role of cavitation (nozzle internal geom-
etry). The size of ligaments and droplets formed by both nonturbulent
and turbulent primary breakup increases along a liquid jet streamwise
direction. Droplets velocity is independent of the size. However, the
characteristics/features of droplets produced via the secondary
breakup dependent strongly on the velocity of cross airflow, and there
is a clear relationship between droplets size and their velocity.

There is a reasonable literature on ligaments diameter and drop-
lets size and velocity generated by the primary breakup for both
non-turbulent [29,45,58,126] and turbulent [58,60,61,65] liquid jets
injected into a cross airflow at STP test conditions. On the other hand,
studies on the effect of HTP on the properties of liquid jet surface
and accordingly the characteristics of disintegrated droplets are still
lacking. Due to the discrepancies between the experimental data
[29] and numerical results [71] for the velocity distribution of such
droplets and their formation rate, three-dimensional high-fidelity
simulations and high resolution images are required.

The characteristics of droplets formed by the secondary breakup
have been investigated quite extensively at STP test conditions. There
exist also a few studies at standard temperature and high pressure
(STHP) test conditions [37,50]. Heat transfer between the liquid and
gaseous phases at high temperature test conditions (which involves
evaporation) certainly affects droplets size and consequently their ve-
locity in the far-field region [142]. This, in turn, would influence the
mixing characteristics between spray droplets and cross airflow. Thus,
further studies are needed to understand the mechanism of two-
phase interaction under more practical (HTP) test conditions.

6. Final concluding remarks and recommendations for future
research

This review paper seeks to provide an overview as well as de-
tailed analysis of the physical phenomena that dominate the primary
breakup regimes, trajectory and penetration, column breakup (frac-
ture) length, and droplets formation of a liquid jet injected
transversely into a subsonic gaseous crossflow. Owing to the im-
portance of this complex two-phase flow-field, numerous
investigations have been reported in recent decades. Although a
wealth of knowledge has been acquired, there still exist discrep-
ancies among the predictions/findings due to several factors, such
as flow-field status (e.g., cavitation, turbulence), liquid properties
(e.g., role of density, viscosity and surface tension), test/operating
conditions (temperature and pressure conditions), liquid injector/
nozzle internal geometry (e.g., discharge coefficient effect), injection
angle (forward or reverse), experimental errors and uncertainties
involved in developing correlations. This overview, therefore, clas-
sified published results and findings based on their pertaining
conditions using non-dimensional numbers. Overall, the litera-
ture revealed that gas Weber number, Weg, plays a crucial role in
defining non-turbulent primary breakup regimes, while liquid jet
Weber number, Wej, is of great importance for the transition to tur-
bulent primary breakup. Jet-to-crossflow momentum flux ratio, q,

is the most important/dominant parameter for predicting the tra-
jectory, penetration, and breakup length of a liquid jet in a crossflow.
While the characteristics of droplets disintegrated during the primary
breakup are influenced by nozzle exit conditions, the features of
droplets produced via the secondary breakup dependent strongly
on the velocity of cross airflow. However, in order to develop com-
prehensive understanding of the physical features of a liquid jet in
a gaseous crossflow with respect to different liquid properties at dif-
ferent test conditions and nozzle/injector geometry, other controlling
non-dimensional parameters, such as jet Reynolds number, Rej, gas
Reynolds number, Reg, density ratio, ρj/ρg, viscosity ratio, μj/μg,
Ohnesorge number, Oh, and Bond number, Bo, as well as the effect
of initial injection angle and nozzle geometry should not be over-
looked. The degree of the importance of each of these parameters
depends on the specific conditions of the problem at hand.

Although substantial progress has been made, several chal-
lenges and shortcomings remain unresolved. For instance, Mazallon
et al. [28] quoted the long ligaments regime presents significant ex-
perimental difficulties due to the problem of tracking flow behavior
when ligaments are long. Moreover, the effect of viscous forces on
the characteristics of a transverse liquid jet and the role of Ohnesorge
number and/or jet Reynolds number of viscous fluids on the primary
breakup regime, turbulent structures, and jet trajectories all still
require further investigations. For example, Farvardin et al. [73] re-
ported that increasing liquid viscosity causes jet trajectory to bend
more, while Birouk et al. [83], who tested relatively more viscous
liquids, reported the opposite scenario, that is an increase in liquid
jet trajectory with viscosity. It is worth mentioning that investigat-
ing viscous liquids is of great importance, as liquid biofuels such as
vegetable oils, which have relatively high viscosity, are gaining more
ground as an important source of energy for power generation.
Another application of viscous liquids concerns the injection of lu-
bricating oil into a rotating annular airflow in the cavity of aero-
engine bearing chamber [44,51]. Several atomization methods can
be used to improve spray properties of viscous liquid jets in order
to produce a more uniform distribution of finer droplets, which include
preheating liquid jet [143], employing electrostatic injection method
[144], using swirl atomizers [145], effervescent atomizers and flow-
blurring injectors [146]. Furthermore, knowledge on the effect of test
conditions (e.g., injecting liquid jet into a high temperature and pres-
sure crossflow, which is practically more relevant) on the primary
breakup regimes, turbulent structures, trajectory and penetration, and
breakup length of a transverse liquid jet is still less established. For
instance, there is lack of experimental investigations on the effect of
high pressure and temperature on turbulent primary breakup and
its corresponding aerodynamic/turbulent transition criterion of a liquid
jet in a gaseous crossflow. In fact, all published experimental studies
on this phenomenon are limited to room test conditions [57–59,62,63].
In addition, as is depicted in Fig. 19, Eslamian et al. [31] reported that
surface breakup regime is initiated at lower q and Weg under both
high temperature and high pressure test conditions, while Song et al.
[50] stated that column/surface breakup transition borderline shifts
towards higher q and Weg when increasing cross airflow pressure.
The effect of density and viscosity ratios on liquid jet trajectory in
the near- and/or far-field regions or both together would be helpful
to reach a comprehensive understanding, even though studying the
near-field region is experimentally challenging due to high drops
density around jet column. Several studies used different imaging di-
agnostics such as shadowgraph, Mie scattering, PIV, and PDA
techniques to examine some features of a transverse liquid jet. These
imaging methods are useful for determining the primary breakup
regimes, trajectory and penetration depth, column breakup length,
and droplets features in the dilute region (see, e.g., [37,138,147]).
Imaging sensor (e.g., high speed camera), however, has limited spatial
resolution particularly in optically jet/spray dense regions due to noise
from multiply-scattered light [70]. Nonetheless, only a few studies

used pulsed holography [29,65] and ballistic imaging [148,149] tech-
niques to acquire more details of the evolution of liquid column
surface and droplets formation as a result of surface breakup in the
primary breakup region (dense region). More information about ex-
perimental imaging techniques employed in the optically dense
regions of a spray can be found in a recent review paper by Linne
[150]. Because of the limitations of experiments in resolving the spa-
tiotemporal evolution of the near-field region, numerical studies such
as direct numerical simulations based on interface tracking/capturing
methods would be invaluable in this case. Nonetheless, it should be
mentioned that, computationally, it remains challenging to resolve
the wide range of spatial and temporal scales involved and to prop-
erly account for the large variation of density across a liquid–gas
interface [71]. Furthermore, while there exist several studies which
examined the effect of the thickness of non-uniform velocity field
in the gas boundary layer at a test section wall on the features of a
transverse liquid jet by employing recessed [93], or protruded [66]
jets instead of flush type, and also by using a shock tube facility [29]
instead of a wind tunnel, the effect of gas boundary layer on the fea-
tures of a transverse liquid jet still requires further investigations. In
addition, while there exist a large body of studies available in the lit-
erature which used a uniform velocity of a cross airflow with a weak
turbulence intensity in the near-wall boundary layer region of a test
section, and also there exist investigations on the effect of a liquid
jet injected transversely into a swirling crossflow [151,152], more
studies are required to examine the effect of the characteristics of a
turbulent cross airflow (e.g., turbulence intensity and turbulent length
scales) on the features of a transverse liquid jet.
