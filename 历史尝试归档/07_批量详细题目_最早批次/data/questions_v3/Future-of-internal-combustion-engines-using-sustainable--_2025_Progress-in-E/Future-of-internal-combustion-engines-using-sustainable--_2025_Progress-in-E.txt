Internal combustion (IC) engines have contributed to global economic development in industrialized societies.
Hydrocarbon fuels used for fueling the IC engines need to be replaced by sustainable and eco-friendly origins that
do not adversely impact the environment locally and globally. Electro-fuels (or E-fuels) and biofuels are essential
to displace fossil fuels. They are primarily produced using renewable electricity and feedstocks, respectively, and
represent  an  emerging  class  of  carbon-neutral  drop-in  fuels  for  the  transport  sector,  which  are  becoming
increasingly important with every passing day globally and have an essential role in the ‘net-zero’ future. This
paper  comprehensively  reviews  the  advancements  in  IC  engines  to  become  more  efficient  in  taking  the  fuel
property advantages of various E-fuels and biofuels in existing engines. The paper focuses on several fuels, among
the most studied ones in the open literature in the last decade, since their adoption might depend on factors such
as the local economic considerations, cultural contexts and the application itself, storability, power requirement,
and  government  policies.  The  paper  covers  these  fuels  by  briefly  introducing  their  production  pathways  and
properties. It then focuses on their engine use to meet the future tailpipe and greenhouse gas emissions norms.
Challenges  regarding  the  modelling  of  engines  powered  by  E-  or  bio-fuels  are  also  included.  E-fuels  offer  a
straightforward  advantage  even  in  engine-out  emissions  and  after-exhaust  emission  control  technologies.  It
represents an opportunity to limit GHG emissions. Moreover, the E(cid:0) (or Bio-) fuels powered engines can cover the
same operating range (or a larger one) with similar efficiency or greater than hydrocarbon fuels. However, using
these fuels still remain challenging. Retrofitting existing engines for using E(cid:0) (or Bio-) fuels depends on the cost
of the fuel injection system for injecting the fuel into the combustion chamber. The transition from fossil fuels can

1. Introduction

Electro-fuels  or  E-fuels  and  biofuels  are  primarily  produced  using
renewable  electricity  and  feedstocks.  They  are  an  emerging  class  of
carbon-neutral  drop-in  fuels  for  the  transport  sector,  which  are
becoming increasingly important with every passing day globally and
have an essential role in the ‘net-zero’ future. E-fuels and biofuels family
covers both gaseous and liquid fuels such as Hydrogen (H2), Ammonia
(NH3),  methane  (CH4),  Methanol  (CH3OH),  DME  (CH3-O-CH3)  (Di-
methyl ether), synthetic gasoline and Diesel. In many cases, these E-fuels
and  biofuel-powered  vehicles  are  superior  to  battery  electric  vehicles
(BEVs)  in  terms  of  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emissions,  as  per  life  cycle
assessment (LCA) studies [1]. Biofuels and carbon content fuels can be
delivered  by  the  existing  fuel  outlets  without  significant  hardware
modifications. European Union (EU) policymakers have shown interest
in adopting E-fuels and biofuels and have mandated their introduction in
a phased manner [2,3]. E-fuels are being promoted as low-emission fuels
in terms of overall GHG or carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions [4]. How-
ever, considering the stringent tailpipe emission norms being adopted
worldwide and the severe challenge of ambient air pollution in many
developing  countries,  addressing  the  issue  of  tailpipe  emissions  from
those  E-fuel-powered  vehicles  is  of  great  significance.  As  most  E-fuel
compositions are being developed as low-emission substitutes for con-
ventional  combustion  fuels  (gasoline  and  diesel),  they  offer  a

straightforward  advantage  even  in  engine-out  emissions  and  for
after-exhaust emission control technologies. Therefore, for carbon-based
E-fuels  driven  vehicles-  3-way  catalytic  converters,  closed  coupled
catalyst-based  devices  (in  case  of  lower  exhaust  temperatures  and
extreme cold conditions), as well as Diesel Oxidation Catalyst (DOC),
Partial Flow Filter (PFF), Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) and Selective
Catalytic  Reduction  (SCR)  cum  ammonia  slip  catalyst  based  nitrogen
oxides (NOx) emission control technologies can be adopted with little or
no  hardware  modifications.  Adaptation  of  existing  IC  engines  to
biofuels/E-fuels has significant scope for advancements in the IC engines
so that the advantages of well-defined compositions of these new fuels
can be harnessed appropriately to meet the low local and GHG expec-
tations.  The  advancements  in  design  and  modelling-based  tools  can
expedite  the  faster  development  of  after-exhaust  emission  control
technologies.

This paper summarizes the advancements in E-fuels and biofuels in
existing  engines  and  their  effects  on  the  tailpipe  and  GHG  emissions.
Dedicated sections providing the details of production, engine optimi-
zation methods, and performance of hydrogen, ethanol, ammonia, and
methanol for transport will be helpful  for policymakers to decide the
suitable combination of fuels and conversion technologies for the sus-
tainable  transport  sector.  This  recent  requirement  of  optimization  of
new generation engines to deliver the optimum performance on various
E-fuels/biofuels has made the latest generation engine modelling tools
essential for the advancement of the engines. Towards the end of the

comparable IC  engine. Despite  this,  higher  hydrogen consumption  by
the IC engines, hybrid electric passenger cars featuring a hydrogen IC
engine have shown a superior life-cycle environmental impact than the
FCV-powered passenger cars [19]. The environmental profile remains
favourable even for a passenger car powered by a H2-ICE. However, its
consumption  is  higher  than  that  of  the  corresponding  hybrid  version
[20], and its application on different types of vehicles could result in
lower overall total cost of ownership (TCO) and environmental impacts
[21].  Lastly,  H2-IC  engine  also  offer  excellent  features  for  car  racing
applications. Pearson et al. [22] showed, for example, that only a fuel
cell with a fuel cell mass-to-power ratio of 5 kg/kW and power output
greater  than  45  kW  can  achieve  faster  lap  time  than  a  H2-IC  engine
vehicle of 30 kW tractive power and 25 % thermodynamic efficiency.
These results highlight the importance of the fuel cell weight bottleneck
in such applications, even though the fuel cell vehicle presents higher
output and efficiency. In summary, the H2-IC engines present various
advantages for specific applications, such as mid-duty and heavy-duty,
as  they  involve  long  distance  and  long  lifetime  operation,  or  racing
applications  due  to  weight  considerations  and  fuel  purity  since  the
Proton-exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) requires a very high pu-
rity of Hydrogen to operate [23].

2. Hydrogen for Decarbonizing Transport

2.1. The hydrogen IC engine rationale

Hydrogen  (H2)  is  a  versatile  and  clean  energy  source  that  has
garnered considerable interest as a viable strategy for mitigating climate
change  and  advancing  towards  a  sustainable  energy  future  [5].
Hydrogen  is,  therefore,  a  good  candidate  for  transport  sector  decar-
bonization. It is a carbon-free fuel produced from renewable energy such
as solar and wind using electrolysis (4–9 $ per kg) [6]. A price of about
US$ 2.50 per kg of green H2 is predicted in the next decade by Glenk and
Reichelstein  [7].  Biogenic  H2  from  food  and  vegetable  waste  using  a
dark fermentation (DF) process is emerging as a sustainable production
pathway with a low-carbon entity [8]. Hydrogen can contain up to seven
times  more  energy  in  mass  basis  than  a  Li-ion  battery,  giving  it  an
advantage over BEVs [9], as shown in Fig. 1 [10].

H2-fueled IC engines represent an alternative to fossil-fuel engines
because they are cost-effective solutions based on well-known technol-
ogies.  Depending  on  the  utilization  and  local  energy  mix,  such  tech-
nology could complement BEVs  or Fuel-Cell Vehicles (FCVs). In most
widely used FCVs, a polymer electrolyte membrane produces electricity
to feed a battery and an electric motor. Depending on the scenario, rare
metals are required to operate many FCVs, often resulting in higher costs
than IC engines [11,12]. Over the years, Fuel Cell technology has made
steady progress and attained the highest energy efficiency in chemical to
electrical energy conversion. Hydrogen-based fuel cells powered vehi-
cles  have  higher  fuel  efficiency  than  traditional  vehicles,  leading  to
lower  operating  costs  and  reduced  brake-specific  fuel  consumption
(BSFC) [13,14]. Hydrogen fuel cell technology’s scalability allows it to
cater to diverse applications, providing flexibility in energy production
and usage.

In comparison to IC engines, fuel cells offer very high efficiency, but
their efficiency can drop in the case of increased hydrogen consumption
[15]. Moreover, the fuel cell performance show significant degradation
as its lifetime increases, as highlighted in several studies [16,17]. This
becomes  of  paramount  importance  in  applications  requiring  a  long
operating lifetime, such as heavy-duty (HD) vehicles [18]. Nonetheless,
as highlighted [19], the fuel cells offer higher efficiency, lowering the
hydrogen  consumption  in  a  passenger  car’s  Worldwide  Harmonised
Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP) driving cycle. This was mainly due
to  the  fuel  cell  and  electric  motor’s  higher  efficiency  compared  to

Renewable energy sources should be promoted to produce H2  and
avoid  the  LCA  penalty.  The  generation  of  hydrogen  can  be  achieved
through  various  methods,  primarily  categorized  into  renewable  and
non-renewable sources. Widely used production methods include steam
methane reforming (SMR), methanol-reforming, coal gasification, and
water  electrolysis.  Renewable  hydrogen  production  methods  include
electrolysis, where water is split into hydrogen and oxygen using elec-
tricity from renewable sources like solar or wind, and biomass gasifi-
cation,  which  converts  organic  materials  into  hydrogen-rich  gas.
Electrolysis is promising as it can produce hydrogen with almost zero
carbon emissions when powered by renewables. However, the efficiency
and cost of electrolysis remain challenges that need to be addressed for
its widespread adoption. Hydrogen production remains dominated by
fossil  fuels,  with  low-emission  hydrogen  accounting  for  less  than  1
million tons annually. However, efforts are underway to scale produc-
tion through electrolysis and carbon capture technologies, potentially
reaching 49 million tons annually by 2030 based on announced projects
[24].  Despite  challenges  in  hydrogen  storage,  several  countries  are
making strides in electrolyzer installations, notably with a final invest-
ment decision on a GW capacity project [25]. These efforts underscore
their  commitment  to  advancing  hydrogen  infrastructure  and  capabil-
ities,  positioning  it  as  a  critical  contributor  to  the  growing  hydrogen
economy.

Biomass gasification also presents a sustainable pathway, but it re-
quires a consistent supply of biomass and can be affected by variations in
feedstock  composition.  Supply-chain  challenges  are  sometimes
encountered  when  using  renewable energy sources  for  hydrogen  pro-
duction. Specific ambient conditions, such as solar irradiation for solar
energy  and  wind  speed  for  wind  energy,  affect  the  output  of  energy
produced by these renewables. In the case of biomass, the need for a
required amount of biomass at a particular place hampers energy pro-
duction  from  this  resource.  Renewable  resources’  dependence  and
intermittent nature can fluctuate hydrogen production [26]. Hydrogen
is  labelled  as  brown  hydrogen  (coal  as  feedstock  material),  grey
hydrogen (gas as feedstock material), turquoise hydrogen (gas/methane
as feedstock material), blue hydrogen (coal/gas as feedstock material),
pink hydrogen (water as feedstock material), yellow hydrogen (water as
feedstock material) and green hydrogen (water as feedstock material),
as shown in Fig. 2 [27].

Nonetheless,  studies  investigating  the  biogenic  production  route
from  wastes  represent  a  sustainable  and  low-carbon  opportunity.

waste  biorefinery  (WB)  approach  has  a  lower  environmental  impact
than standalone bio-hydrogen production, promoting low carbon foot-
prints  [30].  DF  and  methanogenesis  integration  for  producing  green
Hythane/bio-hythane from food waste is specific to the transport sector
[31]. Optimal biohydrogen production occurred at an organic load (OL)
of 40 g COD/L in the acidogenic reactor, while higher OL (50 g COD/L)
favoured biomethane production in the methanogenic reactor [32]. The
H2/(H2+CH4) ratio ranged from 0.1 to 0.3, with 5–12.6 kJ/g energy.
The bio-Hythane composition resembles hydrogen enriched compressed
natural gas (HCNG), offering the potential for biogas upgradation. Bio-
hydrogen and biomethane production from waste to enable bio-HCNG
presents a promising solution for existing transport infrastructure with
environmental  benefits  [33].  However,  optimizing  production  yields,
understanding
selecting
cost-effective  separation  techniques,  and  commercialization  of  acido-
genic processes are some of the challenges [34]. On-board production of
hydrogen through technologies based on plasma with dielectric barrier
discharge (DBD) should be re-investigated in the context of hydrogen
combustion, country-specific policies, and market constraints. It could
be a way to use hydrogen as a combustion promoter effectively, thus
pushing back the flammability limit of current fuels (such as liquified
petroleum gas (LPG) or compressed natural gas (CNG) as examples) on
the  lean  side  and  decreasing  NOx  and  fuel  consumption,  hence  CO2
emissions.  H2-IC  engines  could  be  developed  by  retrofitting  current
generation  compression  ignition  (CI)  engines  to  run  on  hydrogen  or
developing H2-IC engines from scratch: the first solution will contribute
to decarbonizing existing fleets of medium and heavy long-haul vehi-
cles,  avoiding  the  need  to  replace  the  entire  powertrain  and  thus
reducing  costs;  the  second  one  is  required  to  develop  more  efficient
engines with up-to-date technologies. Nonetheless, the development of
H2-IC  engine  must  address  three  main  challenges:  prevention  of
abnormal combustion, mixture preparation, and high efficiency. Fig. 3
provides an overview of H2-IC engine and powertrain development and
usage pathways.

2.3. Hydrogen combustion properties

Hydrogen has some peculiar properties that impact its use in IC en-
gines compared to fossil fuels. Some of them are summarized in Table 1.
Due to its very low temperature of liquefaction (>20 K), hydrogen
for  light-to-HD  vehicles  is  primarily  used  in  gaseous  form  (usually
compressed at 700 bar), leading to requirement of gas injection in the
engine. However, liquid cryogenic injections are also being investigated
[35,36]. The low density of gaseous compressed H2 (42 kg/m3 vs. 0.08
when uncompressed) requires a higher volume to be injected, leading to
a  longer  injection  duration  and  additional  compression  work.  Mixing
must  be  well-optimized  to  address  fuel-air  mixing  issues  and  ensure
charge homogeneity. The high diffusivity of hydrogen (0.71 cm2/s in air
vs 0.22 cm2/s for methane) could help this mixing process, especially in
low turbulent environments. In terms of combustion, the flammability
limits of H2 are much broader than conventional fuels, as illustrated in
Table 1.

When burned, its combustion only produces water without emissions
of  CO2,  carbon  monoxide  (CO),  hydrocarbons  (HC),  or  soot  from  the
combustion compared to fossil fuels. However, due to the higher tem-
perature  enabled  by  higher  adiabatic  flame  temperatures,  given  in
Table 2, the N2 and O2 of the ambient air combine to form NOx through
the thermal NOx formation pathway. This NOx formation can be tackled
by  decreasing  the  equivalence  ratio  (increasing
lambda),  thus
decreasing the peak flame temperature. The adiabatic flame tempera-
ture is divided by more than a factor of 2 by decreasing the equivalence
ratio from 1.0 to 0.25 (Table 2). In Parallel, advancements in design and
modelling-based tools can promote faster development of after-exhaust
emission  control  technologies,  especially  those  designed  for  carbon-
based E-fuels [37].

Hydrogen  has  a  very  high  LBV,  especially  under  stoichiometric
conditions (2.90 m/s vs. 0.48 ms for CH4 at 1 bar and 360 K), which can
lead  to  greater  efficiency  for  spark-ignition  (SI)  engines  as  the  flame
propagation tends to be isochoric combustion, brining it closer to the
theoretical  Otto  cycle.  However,  with  this  high  LBV  and  tendency  to
auto-ignite, the propensity for pre-ignition or knock increases [43,44].
The ability of hydrogen to operate at very lean conditions, with a suf-
ficient flame speed, can moderate the knock or pre-ignition occurrence.
Moreover,  due  to  its  very  low  Lewis  number,  defined  as  the  ratio  of
thermal diffusivity to mass diffusivity, the hydrogen flames are prone to
thermo-diffusive instabilities, leading to wrinkles of the flame front and
its acceleration. This behaviour will be enhanced in a turbulent envi-
ronment  since  the  interaction  between  the  turbulence  and  the  flame
front  will  generate  wrinkles  amplified  through  the  thermo-diffusive

instability mechanism, as highlighted by Abdel-Gayed et al. [45], Welch
et  al.  [46]  and  Wen  et  al.  [47].  Because  of  these  properties,  H2  can
operate with very lean mixtures, leading to lower NOx emissions [48]
(because  of  lower  peak  combustion  temperatures)  but  lower  power
output.

2.4. Challenges of hydrogen use in IC engines

Due to its peculiar properties, the main challenges for H2 IC engines
are (i) preventing abnormal combustion, (ii) reaching zero NOx, and (iii)
achieving very high efficiencies. Some pathways can be used as a bridge
between fossil fuel engines and renewable H2-IC engines to implement
Hydrogen as a fuel [49]. A first example is the development of the H2/
diesel dual-fuel engine [50] as a transition, which shows potential on the
one hand in terms of performances with efficiency similar to baseline
diesel and on the other hand in terms of reducing all emissions (e.g., 30
% reduction in NOx, and 20 % reduction in PM).

For SI engines, adding some hydrogen to the air-fuel mixture is an
excellent way to ensure stability in highly diluted engines (downsized SI
Engine with exhaust gas recirculation (EGR)) and to push back the lean
flammability  limit,  thus  possibly  decreasing  NOx  emissions  [51].  In
Europe, due to the announcement of the fossil fuel-powered IC engine
ban  from  2035,  the  need  to  demonstrate  that  a  H2  powertrain  is  a
possible zero-CO2 solution is rather urgent. The government of India has
launched a green hydrogen mission to achieve its net-zero commitment,
requiring investments in Research and Development (R&D) to develop
hydrogen powertrains.

Two pathways to design a H2  powertrain  are possible:  retrofitting
existing  IC  engines  (such  as  diesel  engines  for  delivery  trucks)  or
developing IC engines "from scratch". In the case of retrofitting diesel
engines,  using  port-fuel  injection  and  water  injection  to  tackle  NOx
emissions  is  a  way  forward  technique  [52].  The  compression  ratio
should be reduced to limit abnormal combustion. With a compromise in
NOx  emissions,  combustion  stability,  and  transient  operation,  a
maximum  indicated  thermal  efficiency  (ITE)  greater  than  45  %  is
achievable, as well as ultra-lean conditions with equivalence ratio < 0.4

[53], as shown in Fig. 4 [54]. To do so, an improvement of the turbulent
motion inside the cylinder is required. In the case of H2, a “swumble”
movement (mixing both swirl and tumble) with high turbulence seems
to  be  an  excellent  technique  to  improve  charge  homogeneity  in  the
cylinder [55].

Lastly, hydrogen lacks inherent lubricating properties, unlike gaso-
line or diesel, potentially accelerating wear and tear on engine compo-
nents  such  as  piston  rings  and  cylinder  walls.  Developing  specific
lubricants  and  coatings  for  H2-IC  engines  is  needed  to  guarantee  its
lifespan [56]. In their review, Goyal et al. [57] highlighted that due to
the  water  condensates  generated  by  hydrogen  combustion  (2.8  times
more in mass than with gasoline at the same torque), the lubricating oil
requires to be strongly resistant to emulsification [58]. Goyal et al. [57]
also underlined challenges such as deterioration of viscosity index and
oil  quality,  wearing  out  of  piston  rings,  and  reduction  in  the  friction
coefficient  upon  using  microalgae  oil  or  with  degraded  and  lower
viscous lubricants but so far,  there have been  too few studies on this
subject to draw any conclusions.

2.5. The need for fundamental studies

To  support  the  development  of  H2-IC  engine  technology,  funda-
mental studies are required to address the main challenges mentioned
above.  As  reviewed by  Verhelst  and  Wallner  [59],  hydrogen  presents
quite  different  combustion  properties  than  other  fuels.  Nonetheless,
considering the conditions encountered in IC engines, such as a very lean
equivalence ratio (down to 0.2–0.3 in some studies [60,61]) or very high
pressure (more than 60 bars [62,63]), this effort must be supported by
fundamental studies focusing on the measurement of flame speed and
ignition delay (ID), enabling the development and validation of kinetic
mechanism for engine-like conditions. Very few measurements of LBV of
hydrogen are available in open literature for very lean conditions (below
equivalence  ratio  of  0.3)  [64–66].  They  would  require  updating,
considering  the  progress  made  in  the  measurement  and  uncertainty
quantification of LBV in the last 15 years. These measurements become
scarcer at higher pressure because the hydrogen/ air mixture is prone to

instabilities,  preventing a proper  measurement  of LBV. Fig. 5 [67] il-
lustrates that the flame becomes cellular, not spherical, and experiences
strong acceleration due to its wrinkling.

These wrinkles can arise due to two instability mechanisms: thermo-
diffusive and hydrodynamic instability. The first one is caused by the
significant difference in mass and thermal fluxes in the flame fronts, thus
generating  wrinkles.  This  is  quantified  by  the  Lewis  number,  which
equals the thermal diffusivity to mass diffusivity ratio. This number is
way below 1.0 for lean hydrogen/air mixtures LeH2 = 0.3), indicating an
unstable  flame,  even  in  engine-like  conditions,  where  such  thermo-
diffusive instabilities were observed by Welch et al. recently [68]. As
underlined by Pitsch [69], this low Lewis number is responsible for an
LBV increase for stoichiometric and rich conditions and a slight decrease
in very lean conditions (ER < 0.5) compared to the unity Lewis number.
Accounting  for  this  low  Lewis  number  is  then  required  to  properly
predict the LBV from numerical simulations and correctly simulate the
flame structure morphology presenting small wrinkles [70]. The simu-
lation  and  prediction  of  the  flame  development  also  require  the
improvement  of  kinetic  mechanisms  and  their  validation  in  engine
conditions (ultra-lean, high pressure, and temperature) [71] to properly
assess  the  fundamental  flame  properties  (such  as  flame  speed,  flame
thickness, ID).

The knowledge of ID is of great importance in predicting and pre-
venting  the  occurrence  of  knock  or  even  super-knock.  Knock  occurs
when the conditions in the engine cylinder trigger the autoignition of
unburned end-gases before the premixed flame consumes them and ig-
nites them by the spark. On the other hand, super-knock is defined as a
sharp rise of the pressure induced by a detonation wave, which is pre-
ceded by low-speed pre-ignition [72]. Since both phenomena are related
to auto-ignition, kinetic mechanisms must predict the ID and must be
validated with measurement in engine-like conditions. Such measure-
ments were recently performed by Villenave et al. [73,74] for lean and
ultra-lean H2/air mixtures, with also the effect of NOx on the ID to mimic
the effect of internal residual gases or EGR. Results also show the dif-
ferences in several kinetic mechanisms among recent ones: Burke et al.
[75], Konnov [76], Mei et al. [77], and Sun et al. [78] and the impor-
tance  of  the  reaction  2 HO2⇌ 2OH + O2  introduced  by  Klippenstein
et al. [79]. Complementary to ID and kinetic mechanisms investigations,
the observation of knocks in the engine using either optical engines [80,
81] or endoscopes would help identify the phenomenon’s origin in the
engine.

In  terms  of  mixture  preparation,  which  is  crucial  for  both  engine
performance  and  emissions, implementing  optical diagnostics  such as
Schlieren [82,83] is an excellent option to support the development of
high-fidelity  models  providing  information  regarding  the  axial  and

radial  propagation  of  jets  through  the  measurement  of  penetration
length as a function of the pack-pressure and the needle motion. The
drawback of the Schlieren images is that they are a projection of a 3D
phenomenon,  inducing  a  lack  of  information  when  analyzed  as  a  2D
object.  Complementary  to  this  technique,  Inverse  laser-induced  fluo-
rescence  (LIF),  where  the  tracers,  e.g.,  hollow  plastic  particles,  are
placed  in  the  ambient  medium  and  not  in  the  air,  can  be  applied  to
characterize the aerodynamics of the hydrogen jet [84]. The evaluation
of  the  local  equivalence  ratio  to  characterize  the  homogeneity  of  the
mixture  remains  challenging.  Still,
it  can  be  achieved  using
laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy, as completed by Ki et al. [85].
All  those  experimental  data  represent  milestones  in  developing
Computational  Fluid  Dynamics  (CFD)  modelling  and  simulations,
especially for their validation, as underlined in [86].

For a better understanding of the H2  combustion process in the en-
gine,  the  knowledge  of  fundamental  combustion  properties  and  the
characterization  of  the  mixing  with  air  are,  as  said,  required  but  not
sufficient. Indeed, the H2/air flame in the engine propagates in a tur-
bulent medium due to the flow induced by the valves and the piston
motion. Therefore, the turbulent combustion regimes occurring in the
combustion chamber need a thorough investigation to understand flame

properties  better.  The  flame  may  experience  various  combustion  re-
gimes with Hydrogen, as illustrated in Fig. 6 [87]. For very lean cases,
the flame can overpass the limit where the Karlovitz number, defined as
the ratio of chemical time scale to the Kolmogorov time scale (i.e., time
scale of the smallest turbulent eddies), equals 100. Above this limit, the
validity of most of the turbulent combustion models currently used is at
stake since they are based on the flamelet regime hypothesis [88]. Yet
observing the flame to confirm the experienced combustion regime is
important as it can differ from the one predicted by the Peters-Borghi
diagram.  For  instance,  Fig.  6  shows  a  propagating  flame  in  the
so-called broken reaction zone where the Karlovitz exceeds 100. The use
of optical engine experiments or a dedicated closed combustion chamber
could be of help in providing turbulent flame speed correlation as done
in Ref. [89], which are used in some combustion models, such as the
G-Equation model [90], available in commercial CFD software to sup-
port the development and optimization of H2 engine.

3. Methanol and DME for decarbonizing transport

3.1. Rational of methanol and DME IC engine fuels

Methanol  (CH3OH)  is  a  single-carbon  fuel,  a  strong  contender  for
transport fuel. The inherent oxygen improves combustion efficiency and
lowers  carbonaceous  emissions.  Also,  particulate  emissions  and  NOx
emissions are reduced compared to conventional fuels. The favourable
physicochemical properties of methanol are [91] (i) Higher flame speed,
(ii) Higher hydrogen-to-carbon ratio, (iii) Availability in liquid state at
NTP, (iv) Requirement of lower stoichiometric AFR for combustion, and
(v) Higher specific energy. The detailed physicochemical properties of
methanol  are  given  in  Table  3.  Traditionally,  it’s  a  widely  traded
chemical  and  has  been  used  in  various  sectors  for  several  decades.
Nowadays, policy makers of different countries are attracted to it due to
vast  handling  experience,  well-established  transport  facilities,  and
easy-to-adapt  ready-made  infrastructure.  Methanol  usage  in  various
countries  as  a  blending  component  with  gasoline  is  continuously
increasing, and other countries are projecting their plans for its use in
the transport sector aggressively [92]. Methanol has garnered attention
as a fuel for SI engines because of its superior octane number compared
to gasoline, its significant heat of vaporization capable of cooling the
in-cylinder charge in direct-injection engines, and its higher fuel oxygen
content, which reduces the soot emissions significantly [93]. Methanol
blending with gasoline is the easiest path for deploying some fractions of
methanol (M5, M10 & M15) to the market. Methanol-fueled technology
is a matured technology, especially for SI engines [94]. The USA pro-
moted methanol-fueled vehicles to overcome the oil crises of the 1970s.
However, their methanol program did not expand over the years due to
lack of methanol price advantage over gasoline. However, other coun-
tries  have  learned  the  lesson  to  handle  energy  scarcity  scenarios  and
environmental impacts. This initiative acted as a foundation stone for
methanol
the
various
methanol-gasoline blending program over time. Iceland, Denmark, and
China  also  run  multiple  programs  to  test  the  feasibility  of  a
methanol-gasoline  blends  for  their  transport  sector  by  fueling  some
fleets with them. Recently, the Ukraine-Russia crisis impacted the bio-
fuel  and  food  market,  and  some  disruptions  were  experienced  in  the
supply  chain.  As  a  result,  the  evolution  of  the  non-food-based  bio--
methanol  program  started  globally  [95].  China  has  experience  in
coal-to-methanol technology; the initial pilot studies were undertaken in
the  1980s.  The  technology  matured  over  time,  and  methanol-fueled
vehicles were promoted in various provinces of China, especially those
with  abundant  methanol  resources  [96].  The  coal-to-methanol  route
does not contribute much to net zero due to its lower contribution to
carbon neutrality. Therefore, countries are beginning to invest in green

than  brown  methanol  (where  coal  is  the  main  feedstock)  [97,98].

and

shipping and has consumed ~11.16 million tons of methanol for various
applications  in  2023  alone. Europe  is also  diversifying  methanol pro-
duction as it has significant environmental benefits over fossil fuels [99].
The Chinese government’s guidelines on methanol as an automotive fuel
further encourage its use in official cars, taxis, and short-distance buses.
Blending options from M5 to M100 showcase the wider adaptability of
methanol-powered vehicles [91].

DME is also an oxygenated (CH3-O-CH3) fuel with C-H and C-O bonds
but without C-C bonds [100]. DME combustion reduces PM emissions
significantly. The energy density of DME is ~64.7 % lower than diesel,
which necessitates a higher fuel mass for producing a diesel equivalent
torque/power  output  [101].  The  higher  cetane  number  and  lower
ignition temperature make DME suitable for CI engines, as it offers a
shorter ID and lower combustion noise than conventional diesel. It is not
an appropriate fuel for the SI engines. DME fueling enables CI engines to
operate on a higher EGR ratio, drastically reducing NOx emissions. The
higher  latent  heat  of  vaporization  also  adds  to  reduction  in  the  peak
in-cylinder temperature, reducing the NOx emissions. DME is gaseous at
normal ambient temperature and even at (cid:0) 20
C. DME must be pres-
surized  to  more  than  0.5  MPa  to  maintain  its  liquid  state  at  normal
temperature  (25
C)  and  its  vapour  pressure  varies  with  temperature
[101].  Vapour  lock  issues  with  DME  can  be  easily  prevented  by
increasing  the  fuel  delivery  pressure.  DME  has  a  lower  viscosity  and
poor lubricity, making it technically challenging to operate an existing
engine [102], as seen in Table 3.

South Korea invested heavily in DME-fueled engines several decades
ago  [103].  But  the  lack  of  DME  fuel  distribution  infrastructure  and
challenges  associated  with  engine  operations  hampered  the  research
and large-scale deployment. DME could be used with LPG infrastructure
as  DME  has  the  fuel  properties  closest  to  LPG  [104].  Also,  DME-LPG
blends  are  promoted  for  cooking  and  engine  applications.  Leading
groups,  such  as  Akzo  Nobel,  Volvo  Truck,  Amoco,  AVL  Powertrain,
AVL-List, and Haldor Topsoe, are trying to come up with DME standards
[105].  Amoco  collaborated  with  the  Gas  Authority  of  India  Limited
(GAIL) and India Oil Company Limited (IOCL) to offer DME for three
versatile  applications,  namely  cooking,  power  generation,  and  as  an
alternate fuel for diesel engines [106]. Though several agreements were
made, British Petroleum (BP) merged with Amoco, to become BP Amoco
in 2000, and then terminated various projects. At a later date, the China
DME Association (CDA) and Korea DME Forum (KDF) were formed to
promote DME research [105]. DME research has again started in various
countries to mitigate the impact of stricter emission norms in automo-
tive applications. India has recently demonstrated the feasibility of 100
% DME-fueled tractor engines for agriculture [107]. India’s low petro-
leum consumption per capita is in contrast to its high population density
and it is bound to increase with time. The growth of economy in any
country is intrinsically tied to their energy access, making their transi-
tion to cleaner alternatives crucial. The potential of methanol and DME
in addressing energy demands and decarbonization goals are summa-
rized in following sub-sections.

3.2. Production of methanol and DME

Methanol  and  DME  emerged  as  strong  candidates  due  to  their
versatility  in  production  from  various  feedstocks,  including  wastes.
Their  liquid  form,  derived  from gasification  and  Fischer-Tropsch  pro-
cesses  with  the  potential  for  CO2  sequestration,  makes  them  highly
scalable.  China’s  recent  establishment  of  a  commercial-scale  CO2-to-
methanol  plant  in  Henan  Province  demonstrates  the  viability  of  such
solutions [20]. DME is generally produced through synthesis, by dehy-
drating methanol using an acid catalyst.

Methanol  production  pathways  were  established  several  decades
ago,  but  the  route  was  mainly  from  non-renewable  feedstocks.  The
regulators were discouraging the use of non-renewable feedstocks with
red  eyes  because  they  emitted  harmful  emissions  in  one  way  or  the
other.  Hence  various  regulatory  bodies  suggest  shifting  the  fuel’s

production pathways to using renewable feedstocks for lowering their
overall carbon footprint. The feedstocks and energy invested for meth-
anol production must be from renewable sources such as geothermal,
wind,  biomass,  solar,  and  hydro.  Methanol  is  labelled  with  various
colours  based  on  the  feedstocks  used  for  its  production,  as  shown  in
Fig.  7 [108].  The  variety  of  feedstocks  used  for  methanol  production
along with colour labels are (i) Brown methanol; coal as a feedstock, (ii)
Grey methanol; natural gas as a feedstock, (iii) Blue methanol; carbon
capture and storage combined with the blue hydrogen as a feedstock,
(iv)  E-methanol;  renewable  electricity used as  a  feedstock  along  with
green  hydrogen,  (v)  Bio-methanol;  Biomass  is  a  primary  feedstock.
E-methanol and bio-methanol are in green methanol category. Choosing
methanol  over  syngas  is  advantageous  due  to  its  more  energy-dense
liquid form, serving as an excellent hydrogen carrier. However, meth-
anol injection presents challenges in the engine development, combus-
tion, and spray dynamics, necessitating further research.

3.3. Methanol-operated IC engines

China has already demonstrated the applications of methanol-fueled
vehicles in its many provinces [109]. Several researchers have investi-
gated methanol-gasoline blends [110,111] or pure methanol [112,113]
for  SI  engine  applications.  Kalwar  et  al.  [114,115]  conducted  an
extensive study to evaluate the technical feasibility of M15 fueling for
the  production-grade  Bharat  Stage-VI  (BS-VI)  engine  used  for
medium-duty transport applications. The lambda values were identical
for M15 and gasoline fueling during this assessment. The combustion
characteristics  were  almost  similar  for  gasoline  and  M15  fueling,
although methanol addition improved it due to enhancement in flame
speed and higher ON. The influence of methanol addition was reflected
in the cycle-by-cycle variations as the coefficient of variance (CoV) of
IMEP  was  lower  for  M15  than  baseline  gasoline.  Also,  superior  com-
bustion stability and lower heat transfer losses were observed for M15
fueling. As a result, 1 % higher brake thermal efficiency (BTE) and 6 %
lower BSFC were observed. Methanol’s addition to gasoline reduced the
CO, HC emissions, and particulate number (PN) compared to baseline

methanol/methanol-gasoline blends. Iyer et al. [116] investigated the
effect of hydrogen addition (3, 9, 12 %) on a methanol-fueled gasoline
direct injection (GDI) engine by varying the methanol injection timing.
Results showed potential benefits with the in-cylinder pressure suddenly
increasing  because  of  9  %  hydrogen  added  to  the  methanol  mixture
compared to pure methanol operation in the model. Beyond this per-
centage, in-cylinder pressure reduced due to a drastic reduction in the
fuel energy content of the charge.

Researchers have tried to use methanol either as methanol-gasoline
blend  or in pure form. CI engines are widely used for heavy machin-
ery and HD transport/stationary applications. Researchers and original
equipment  manufacturers  (OEMs)  are  now  trying  to  harness  the  po-
tential of methanol in  fueling CI engines. Methanol can be used with
diesel  via  several  techniques,  such  as  (i)  blending  (methanol-diesel
blends), (ii) port fuel  injection  (methanol injection in  port and diesel
injection directly in the combustion chamber), and (iii) high-pressure
direct injection (HPDI) (direct injection of diesel and methanol in the
combustion chamber). HPDI can be achieved in two ways: (a) using two
different  injectors  for  methanol  and  diesel,  and  (b)  using  a  co-axial
injector (methanol and diesel injection using a single injector) [117].
The co-axial injector concept has evolved further due to its promising
capabilities to replace diesel as single and double-channel co-axial in-
jectors.  A single-channel  co-axial  injector  injects  methanol  and  diesel
through a single channel in the injector. In contrast, the dual-channel
co-axial  injector  uses  two  different  channels  for  diesel  and  methanol
injections. The HPDI technique has garnered attention from researchers,
and several case studies are discussed in the following sub-section.

Dong et al. [118] assessed a non-premixed dual fuel concept for HPDI
of methanol and pilot diesel. For this, a unique new cylinder head (1) &
(2) was designed to mount the methanol injector (4) in the centre of the
head. The diesel pilot injector (3), in the off-centre positions, is shown in
Fig. 8 [118]. This unique cylinder head was divided into upper (1) and
lower sections (2) for easier manufacturing. It was based on three valve
configuration  concept.  For  this  cylinder,  two  intake  ports  (6)  and  a
single exhaust port (5) were designed to create room for a pilot diesel
injector.  The  inlet  valve  contains  direct  zero-swirl  intake  port.  An
extruded buffer joint was provided to release the thermal stress.

The  diesel  was  injected  into  the  combustion  chamber  before

methanol injection. The idea was to ensure high temperature and high-
pressure conditions suitable for methanol combustion before its injec-
tion. The engine experiment was conducted at a constant engine speed of

1500 rpm. Two different fuel rail pressures were set for methanol (1000
bar)  and  diesel  (1200  bar)  injections.  Sufficient  airflow  ensured  sus-
tained diffusion combustion during the experiment. λ>1.7 was ensured
throughout the engine experiment. The IMEP changed from 4.2 to 13.8
bar, and the methanol substitution ratio (MSR) varied from 45 to 95 %.
Methanol  and  pilot  diesel  injection  timings  were  swapped  to  achieve
higher BTE and minimal emissions.

HPDI concept exhibited three different phases of heat release rate
(HRR): Ignition of pilot diesel and combustion (Phase I), diesel diffusion
flame  development  and  its  merger  with  the  early  stage  of  methanol
combustion (Phase II), and the phase-dependent start of methanol in-
jection, and combustion of methanol substituting baseline diesel (Phase
III).  The  experimental  results  of  combustion  stability  in  the  HPDI  of
methanol and consequent emissions are given in Fig. 9 [118].

Kumar et al. [119] proposed a co-axial injector concept based on a
simulation study for displacing 90 % diesel (on an energy basis) with
methanol  for  a  large-bore  locomotive  engine.  The  locomotive  engine
operates on eight notches: (i) 350 rpm (1st Notch), 450 rpm (2nd Notch),
550 rpm (3rd Notch), 650 rpm (4th Notch), 750 rpm (5th Notch), 850 rpm
(6th  Notch), 950 rpm (7th  Notch), and 1050 rpm (8th  Notch). The base
model  for  the  ALCO-251  locomotive  engine  was  prepared  using
‘GT-Power.’  They  validated  the  simulated  in-cylinder  pressure  traces
and  HRR  with  the  experimental  results  of  these  parameters  for  the  4
Notches: (i) 5th Notch, (ii) 6th Notch, (iii) 7th Notch, and (iv) 8th Notch,
as shown in Fig. 10 [119]. An acceptable agreement was found between
the validation parameters (In-cylinder pressure and HRR) in the exper-
iments and simulations. For the 8th and 7th notches, the GT-Power model
predicted lower in-cylinder pressure than the experimental one. It pre-
dicted a higher in-cylinder pressure than measured for the 6th  and 5th
Notches. In the simulated injector body, a couple of the injectors were
housed in a single body such that one injector injects methanol, and the
other  one  injects  diesel.  The  controllers  of  the  co-axial  injector  were
actuated such that methanol was injected in a hot environment created
by the pilot diesel combustion, as shown in Fig. 11(b) [119]. According

to  the  co-axial  injector  concept,  diesel  is  a  spark/combustion  energy
source that ignites the methanol.

They performed Pareto optimization and recommended 0.544 mm
nozzle  hole  diameter,  five  nozzle  holes  for  methanol  injection,  0.486
mm  nozzle  hole  diameter,  and  three  nozzle  holes  for  the  pilot  diesel
injection. HPDI of Methanol exhibited higher in-cylinder pressure than
the baseline diesel model. When the HPDI technique was used through a
modern  co-axial  injector  concept,  diesel  and  methanol  were  injected
directly into  the combustion chamber.  Diesel injections occurred in a
highly compressed in-cylinder environment, and combustion started in a
combustion chamber. The diesel flames acted as an ignition source for
methanol injection. This kind of strategy led to three phases of HRR, as
already discussed. Since the high methanol mass, the inherent oxygen
was  added  to  improve  combustion  efficiency  [120].  Also,  the  brake
thermal  efficiency  improved,  and  NOx  emissions  reduced  using

The common rail system was used for diesel and methanol fueling,
and fuel mass and injection timings were controlled precisely. A dual
channel injector is a double needle valve. When the inner needle moves
upward, it injects diesel, and methanol injection begins when the outer
needle  moves  upward.  In  this  case,  the  supply  lines  for  diesel  and
methanol are different, and their respective individual systems control
their injections. Also, injections of methanol and diesel do not interfere
with  each  other.  There  were  channels  inside  and  outside  the  needle
valve in a single-channel injector. The diesel supply pressure pushes the
needle valve up, and part of the diesel is injected into the combustion
chamber. Once the diesel injection ends, the needle valve falls, and the
methanol supply pushes the needle valve to inject a large quantity of
methanol. The nozzle diameters and fuel injection pressure used for the
double-channel and single-channel injectors are shown in Table 4.

They recommended diesel energy to be 10 % of the total energy for
engine operation because a diesel quantity too small or too large would
lead to engine knocking. Too small a diesel quantity leads to the com-
bination of methanol premixed combustion phase and methanol diffu-
sion  combustion  phase  heat  release,  which  eventually  increases  the
HRR, leading to engine knock. Too high a diesel quantity leads to the
combination of diesel premixed combustion phase and methanol diffu-
sion  combustion  phase  heat  release,  leading  to  knocking.  They
concluded that a combination of low fuel injection pressure and large
nozzle diameter suppresses the knock intensity and controls the HRR;
however,  it  deteriorates  the  fuel  economy.  Combining  higher  fuel  in-
jection pressure (FIP) and narrower nozzle hole diameters improves the
fuel economy and combustion. They recommended optimized FIP and
nozzle  hole  diameter  combination  for  a  single  channel  injector  to  be
0.36 mm and 27.4 MPa. They found 0.4 mm and 18 MPa pressure highly

methanol  fueling  compared  to  baseline  diesel  fueling,  as  shown  in
Fig. 12 [119]. This study established the concept of a co-axial injector
for powering large-bore locomotive engines using methanol.

Li et al. [121] evaluated the dual fuel concept for diesel methanol
fueling by directly injecting methanol and diesel without modifying the
engine cylinder head. This concept is known as the ‘co-axial injector’
concept, where a single injector directly injects methanol and diesel into
the combustion chamber. This study was conducted on a virtual plat-
form  using  commercial  3D  CFD  software  ‘Converge.’  The  in-cylinder
pressure and HRR curves were compared for experiments and simula-
tions at full load and 2500 rpm. The computational domain was defined
to cover the entire combustion process. It was set for intake valve closing
(IVC) and exhaust valve opening (EVO). This study used the chemical
kinetics  of  n-heptane  for  diesel  combustion.  The  simulated  Pmax  was
0.15 % lower than the experiment, as shown in Fig. 13 [121]. The model
was found to be reasonably accurate for further research.

Since the dual channel for diesel and methanol led to complexity in
machining  and  higher  development  costs,  they  proposed  a  single-
channel injector concept, as shown in Fig. 14 [121].

suitable for dual-channel injectors for methanol.

Liu et al. [122] assessed the potential of methanol for HD applica-
tions using the pre-chamber combustion (PCC) concept. The 6-cylinder

14

metal diesel engine was converted to a single-cylinder optical engine by
deactivating  the  valves  of  the  remaining  five  cylinders.  A  flat  optical
piston replaced the metal piston with a long sleeve, and optical access
was provided from the bottom of the piston. The new pre-chamber (PC)
assembly, the spark plug, and the fuel channel were placed in the diesel
injector  socket  to  enable  the  PCC  concept.  Two  injectors  injected
methanol. For the optical engine experiment, the engine was operated at
1200 rpm. They visualized the jet flame development using an optical
engine, as shown in Fig. 15 (a) [122]. Then, the computational domain
was developed, as shown in Fig. 15 (b) [122]. Flame luminosity images
and in-cylinder pressure traces were used as a base parameter for vali-
dating the “virtual model” with the experimental data. While exploring
the PCC concept, they evaluated different piston profiles for methanol
fueling,  namely  (i)  Flat,  (ii)  U  shape,  and  (iii)  ω  shape,  as  shown  in
Fig. 16 [122].

The comparison of experimental and predicted in-cylinder pressure
traces  for PC  and main  chamber (MC) are shown in  Fig. 17 [122].  A
reasonable  agreement  was  noticed  between  the  experimental  and
simulated  in-cylinder  pressure  traces.  However,  the  computational
domain predicted slightly higher in-cylinder pressure for both MC and
PC. For PC, two peaks were observed w.r.t. MC, where the first peak was
attributed to the flame propagation, followed by pressure increment in
PC, and the second peak was due to flame propagation and pressure in
the MC. They also compared the measured average images to the pre-
dicted  projected  hydroxyl  radical  (OH)  density,  as  shown  in  Fig.  18
[122]. According to their previous investigations, the line of sight OH
radical distribution represents the qualitative information of jet flame
evolution [123]. They  reported that the  flat piston and  optimized  PC
resulted in higher BTE because of lower wall heat transfer losses from
the combustion. They also recommended using EGR strategies beyond
12.5 bar IMEP to nullify the auto-ignition of end gas and reduce NOx
formation. Chen et al. [124] evaluated the potential of methanol for HD
multi-cylinder  engines  using  fumigation  strategy,  also  known  as  the
diesel  methanol  dual-fuel  (DMDF)  concept.  The  influence  of  three
different methanol injector positions, at (i) the intake manifold, at (ii)
the distal end of the inlet duct, and (iii) near the end of the inlet duct,
were assessed for the cylinder-to-cylinder variations. They reported that
the degree of unevenness among the cylinders reduced upon retarding
diesel injection  timings. Also, the degree  of unevenness improvement
among the cylinders was found for the DMDF concept vis-`a-vis baseline
diesel.  Cylinder-to-cylinder  variations  increased  upon  increasing  the
MSR while operating the engine on the DMDF concept. The CoV of IMEP

(COVIMEP) increased with increasing MSR at 50 and 75 % engine loads.
However, no significant effect was noticed at the full load. CO and HC
emissions  increased with increasing MSR. The engine load conditions
and  MSR  dominantly  influenced  the  soot  emissions.  At  50  and  75  %
engine  loads,  the  soot  emissions  decreased  upon  increasing  the  MSR
while it first increased and then decreased at 100 % engine load.

Hydrogen  and  methanol  enhance  the  laminar  flames  due  to
increased  charge  reactivity,  reducing  the  ID,  and  accelerating  the
laminar  flames  [125,126].  Higher  methanol  concentration  in  a  blend
enhances its reactivity at elevated temperatures while suppressing it at
lower temperatures, with the transition temperature occurring around
970–980 K, while showing negligible dependence on pressure. Further
investigations are needed to fully understand the impact  of methanol
addition  on  spark  ignition  timing,  particularly  at  temperatures
exceeding 1000 K. Flame kernel formation highly depends on the spark
timing, significantly affecting the in-cylinder pressure and engine power
output. Also, the change in spark timing compensates for the motions of
the combustion gases, depending on the combustion temperature, which
influences  cyclic  variations  [127].  The  retardation  in  spark  timing
beyond a specific limit increases the residual gases. The spark timing
needs to be optimized for the engine load conditions.

Interestingly,  the  existing  engines  only  have  the  optimized  spark
timing  for  gasoline  fueling.  Adding  methanol  changes  the  physico-
chemical properties of the test fuel, and most certainly the latent heat of
vaporization. It leads to cold-startability issues if the spark timing is not
optimized for that particular methanol-gasoline blend. Further optimi-
zation of methanol engines is needed to minimize CO2  emissions and
fuel  consumption, considering factors like BTE, noise, vibrations, and
lubricity [91,128].

direct injection (CRDI) (for high pressure) fuel system is a way to ach-
ieve/realize methanol/DME RCCI combustion in existing diesel engines.
DME has a lower calorific value than diesel, requiring either a longer
injection duration or higher pressure to cater to an energy equivalence of
diesel. Fig. 19 indicates that to meet the remaining 40 % of the energy
share from the high reactivity fuel (HRF), more mass of DME is injected
than diesel with higher injection duration and pressure.

The  engine  experiments’  results  on  the  modified  1.5  L,  three-
cylinder, turbocharged, CRDI diesel engine are presented here. Engine
modifications are shown in Fig. 20.

The use of oxygenated low-carbon fuels like methanol and DME in
RCCI  mode  would  enhance  the  in-cylinder  reactivity  due  to  the  in-
cylinder  blending  approach,  extending  leaner  operation,  resulting  in
shorter combustion duration (CD) than gasoline/diesel and methanol/
diesel combinations [20] due to superior ignition quality of DME and
faster-burning characteristics of methanol. Fig. 21 compares ID and CD
between methanol/ diesel (M/D) and methanol/ DME dual fuel RCCI
operation.

The production process of DME is simple and less expensive [129,
130].  DME  has  a  higher  cetane  number  and  lower  autoignition  tem-
perature.  DME’s  lower  boiling  point  and  vapour  pressure  result  in  a
wider spray, better charge mixing, more ignition spots, and complete
combustion inside the cylinder. So far, DME has been used as a fuel in a
CI  engine  under  conventional  combustion  and  homogeneous  charge
compression ignition (HCCI) modes and has proved to be a potential fuel
for  CI  engines.  Furthermore,  the  reactivity  gradient  significantly
improved compared to other fuel combinations using the methanol and
DME  fuel  combinations  [131].  The  enhancement  in  reactivity  is

[131]  shows  the  effect  of  DME  on  dual  fuel  Cetane  number.  The
enhanced charge reactivity due to DME as an HRF compared to diesel
with methanol shortened the ID and CD, as shown in Fig. 21.

The effect of oxygenated dual fuel methanol and DME combination
on the combustion characteristics is shown in Fig. 23 [131] at low and
medium  loads  by  comparing  them  with  methanol/diesel  RCCI  and
conventional diesel combustion (CDC).

The  results  presented  in  Fig.  23 [131]  are  compared  at  similar

maintained the same at diesel, M/D, and M/DME operations. In the RCCI
operations to attain the same, EGR and the start of injection (SoI) of HRF
(i.e., diesel/DME) were adjusted to achieve the CA50. Fuel energy input
was maintained by adjusting the low-reactivity fuel (LRF) and HRF flow
rates.  The  CDC  mode  resulted  in  a  typical  premixed  and  diffusion
combustion at the operating conditions.

In comparison,  both  M/D and  M/DME dual-fuel RCCI  combustion
presented only a premixed combustion. The absence of diffusion com-
bustion is seen clearly in the RCCI case. These combustion characteris-
tics are achieved by enhancing the mixing of air-fuel mixture through
the  RCCI  strategy.  A  port-injected  high-octane  methanol  resists  the
autoignition  of  directly  injected  diesel/DME,  thereby  providing  pro-
longed  ID  compared  to  the  diesel  operation  and  promoting  fuel-air
mixing. A preferred, advanced direct injection strategy in RCCI is also
the reason for the ID. This in-cylinder blending of two different reac-
tivity  fuels  using  a  port  injection  of  LRF  and  direct  injection  of  HRF
facilitates  reactivity  stratification,  equivalence  ratio,  and  temperature

systems. These modifications are a primary challenge for engine man-
ufacturers as they need to completely replace the engine components
that  are  quite  expensive.  Therefore,  the  efforts  were  also  focused  on
developing 100 % DME-fueled engines without major hardware modi-
fications. Tripathi et al. [132] developed a 100 % DME-fueled engine
without altering the pump pressurization capacity, changing the nozzle
opening pressure, changing the plunger diameter, enlarging nozzle hole
diameters, and increasing the number of nozzle holes. To achieve this,
the SoI timing was optimized for DME fueling; the existing SoI resulted
in significantly retarded in-cylinder combustion compared to baseline
diesel,  which  further  deteriorated  the  engine  performance.  For  this
behaviour, higher compressibility of DME was responsible, which low-
ered the acoustics velocity and delayed the injector opening [133]. For

CA  Pmax  also  came  near  diesel
with optimized SoI for DME compared to the existing SoI for DME. This
study demonstrated that existing engines could operate on DME without
significant  hardware  modifications,  which  were  also  reported  earlier.
Previous efforts focused on developing DME-fueled engines for transport
applications  such  as  bus,  truck,  and  car  engines.  Recent  efforts  are
focussed to develop 100 % DME-fueled engines. Agarwal et al. [134]

The torque/power produced by DME engine was marginally lower at
initial speeds and then became almost equivalent or higher than diesel
engine, as shown in Fig. 26 [134].

Particulate characteristics of DME-fueled engines were assessed, as
shown in Fig. 27 [135], for low (1.29 bar BMEP), mid (3.88 bar BMEP),
and high load (6.47 bar BMEP) conditions at 1600 rpm. The radar graph
was  plotted  with  four  quadrants:  NOx-soot,  total  particulate  matter
(TPM)-total  particulate  number  (TPN),  soot-TPM,  and  TPN-NOx.  The
DME  envelope  was  concise  inside  the  diesel  envelope,  demonstrating
lower TPM, TPN, NOx, and soot emissions for DME fueling compared to
baseline diesel. Agarwal et al. [136] showed that cyclic variations were
lower for DME fueling than diesel, from low-to-high loads. The higher

perature,  and  eliminating  fuel-rich  combustion.  This  helps  to  achieve
simultaneous reduction in oxides of nitrogen and soot emissions with
improved BTE. DME as a HRF helps achieve superior global reactivity
than diesel, which addresses the unburnt emissions at lower load RCCI
operation [32]. The absence of a direct C-C bond in DME further reduces
soot. M/D and M/DME dual-fuel RCCI combustion resulted in superior
combustion, performance, and emission characteristics than CDC mode.
Several researchers suggested that the DME-fueled engine operation
is possible by making major hardware modifications to the fuel injection

cyclic variations at lower loads for DME could be tackled by optimizing
the fuel injection strategy.

3.5. Future prospects of methanol and DME

Ongoing  research  into  injection  challenges,  combustion  optimiza-
tion, and advanced modes will contribute to developing high-efficiency

engines, mitigating environmental impacts, and promoting a sustainable
future.  There  is  no  conflict  between  methanol  and  DME.  The  same
feedstock and pathway are used to produce these two fuels. Once their
upscaled capacity of production is developed, it can be channelized to
either  methanol  or  DME  production,  depending  on  applications  and
specific needs. Hence, creating the production infrastructure for one fuel
would  aid  the  production  of  the  other  fuel  without  substantial

18

A.K. Agarwal et al.

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 110 (2025) 101236

investments. These two fuels have great relevance for various countries
for the development of pyrolysis or bio-oil gasification processes, which
can  leverage  the  decentralized  production  of  bio-oil/bio-crude  (made
from biomass and other wastes like plastic and tyres) and centralized or
decentralized gasification of bio-oil. The higher energy density bio-oil
will  also  lead  to  better  LCA  over  biomass  gasification-based  syngas.
Also,  the  H2/CO  ratio  can  be  better  adjusted  for  methanol  and  DME
production  with  bio-oil  gasification-based  syngas  over  direct  biomass
gasification-based  syngas.  More  pilot-scale  studies  are  needed  to
generate authentic data and move in this direction. Methanol and DME
will be important fuels for decarbonizing future transport and energy
independence.  These fuels  can be directly used in  existing fossil fuel-
based engines through blending and dual approach. Still, developing a
dedicated fuel injection system for dual fuels will result in furthering
efficiency  and  emissions  reduction.  The  issues  with  methanol  fueling
highly  depend  on  the  methanol  concentration  used  for  preparing
methanol-gasoline  blends.  The  lower  methanol-concentrated  blends,
such as M5, M10 & M15, don’t require significant modifications in the
fuel  injection system. In the  case of  M85, the  possibility of cold start
issues  remains high. Still, it  is valid for  older vehicles  where the fuel
injection system does not use the electronic components and electronic
control  unit  (ECU). The LHV  of  methanol  can be  compensated by  re-
calibrating  the  fuel  injection  system,  where  either  fuel  mass  quantity
can be increased or injection duration can be extended. A recent study
by  Agarwal  et  al.  [137,138]  demonstrated  the  M85-fueled  engine  by
re-calibrating the spark ignition and fuel maps through an open ECU.
Then, the entire engine was fitted on a vehicle chassis, the fuel maps
were  recalibrated,  and  no  operational  issues  were  observed  while
driving  the  vehicle.  Therefore,  advancements  in  electronics  made  the
retrofitting/re-calibration path easier for adapting methanol in existing
SI  engines.  The  potential  of  methanol  has  attracted  researchers  to
demonstrate methanol-fueled CI  engines. Methanol-diesel phase  sepa-
ration issues limit methanol use in CI engines. The HPDI technique has
emerged as a way to replace diesel.

Similarly, retrofitting existing engines is also possible by accommo-
dating a dedicated DME supply system and modifying the fuel injection
system, such as high pressure pump, injectors, and adding a fuel feed
pump, etc. Significant modifications are not needed in the advanced fuel
injection systems though. The only hurdle is a shorter driving range if
the existing fuel tank is used on the vehicles, which could be resolved by
adopting larger tanks or an addition of a new tank. The leakage issues of
DME  fuel  lines  can  be  addressed  by  incorporating  doubly-thick  pipe-
lines. The lower lubricity possibly results in premature failure and wear
issues  with  fuel  injectors  and  pumps,  and  this  issue  can  be  easily
addressed  by  using  lubricity  additives.  A  suitable  combination  of

methanol and DME is also promising for designing engines with ultra-
low emissions based on emerging combustion strategies such as RCCI.
Exploration  advanced  combustion  modes  is  imperative  to  develop
highly efficient methanol and DME engines. Optimizing split injections,
ranging from (cid:0) 80 to (cid:0) 3
CA, is essential for methanol/DME dual-fuel
RCCI combustion engines. During this crank angle duration, optimiza-
tion will reduce the ID and accelerate the combustion during various
combustion stages. Broadening the reaction zone for the regions of air
and  combustion  is  also  essential.  Methanol  and  DME  both  have  fuel
oxygen; thus, their air interactions must be understood and optimized
for harnessing the potential of split injection strategy.

4. Ethanol for Decarbonizing Transport

4.1. Rationale of Ethanol as IC engine fuel

To  respond  to  the  urgent  need  to  reduce  the  carbon  footprint  of
transport, ethanol could be a promising part of the solution. It is already
a  gasoline  constituent  in  pumps  in  India  and  France  and  many  other
parts  of  the  world,  and  new  engines  are  being  designed  globally  for
higher ethanol blends for performance enhancement. India has already
achieved a 4.60 % v/v ethanol blending target during the Supply year
2023-24.  Efforts  to  increase  production  with  diverse  feedstocks  are
being  made  to  reach  20  %  v/v  blending  targets  for  gasoline  engines.
Once  surplus  production  is  achieved,  ethanol  can  be  considered  for
partial substitution of diesel in higher quantities. In France, ethanol co-
blended gasoline is used as a higher research octane number (RON) fuel
and to lower GHG emissions [139].

Bioethanol in India is mainly produced from sugar-based sources and
surplus  food  grains  unfit  for  human  consumption.  The  new  biofuels
policy released in 2018 has expanded the allowable feedstock basket,
which now includes crop residues and industrial and municipal wastes,
including used cooking oils [140]. Further, the target for achieving 20 %
v/v ethanol blending in the country has been revised to Ethanol Supply
Year 2025-26, from originally 2030. The estimated ethanol requirement
for 2025-26 to achieve 20 % v/v blending is 10.16 billion litres [141]. In
addition  to  first-generation  (edible  feedstocks),  second-generation
(non-edible biomass-based feedstocks), and third-generation (algae or
engineered  biofuel  crops-based  feedstocks)  ethanol  is  also  being
attempted.  IOCL  has  set  up  2G  and  3G  ethanol  plants  at  its  Panipat
Refinery, which uses paddy straw and refinery off-gases as feedstocks,
respectively [142]. While the use of ethanol decreases most emissions,
aldehyde  emissions  (acetaldehyde  in  particular)  may  increase  with
higher  ethanol  content.  This  increase  is  minimal  for  lower  ethanol
blends (up to 20 % v/v ethanol blends). This and cold start emissions,

notably  higher  ethanol-containing  blends,  require  effective  emission
control  strategies  [143].  The  hygroscopic  nature  of  ethanol  must  be
handled to avoid any separation from gasoline. The fuel storage across
the  supply  chain  must  be  leak-proof,  ensuring  no  water  or  moist  air
ingress. However, since the ethanol-gasoline blends are being handled
for many years, no significant issues are expected in the current scenario
[144].

4.2. Performance of ethanol-fueled engines

Ethanol in diesel engines faces the main challenge of lower cetane
number, which needs attention. Likewise, the problem of lowering the
flash point of diesel due to ethanol blending also needs to be addressed
as a safety concern. Performance of ethanol in a high compression ratio
(CR 26) CI engine was investigated. It resulted in a stable engine oper-
ation with ethanol-diesel blends with 50 % ethanol. Fig. 28 shows the
variations in the in-cylinder pressure and HRR for varying SoI for E50
and D100. Diesel was tested in conventional combustion mode, i.e. at a
compression  ratio  of  17.5  and  SoI  of  27
CA  before  top  dead  center
(bTDC),  which  was  considered  as  baseline  and  E50  was  tested  in  the
engine with a CR 26 at varying SoIs in the range of 27

bTDC (at 1.8 bar BMEP). Early injection timing provided sufficient time
for  vaporization/mixing,  resulting  in  a  higher  degree  of  complete
combustion. Overall combustion phasing also advanced with an early
injection  of  E50.  Higher  engine  load  condition  (3.4  bar  BMEP)  also
showed similar Pmax  and combustion phasing advancement behaviour.
Ethanol  possessed  higher  latent  heat  absorption  during  the  fuel-air
mixing  phenomenon,  further  delaying  the  mixing  in  comparison  to
baseline diesel. This resulted in a misfiring possibility and larger cyclic
variations  during  the  combustion.  Advancement  of  SoI  from  27
CA
bTDC to 42
CA bTDC indicated a sharper and clearer premixed com-
bustion zone for E50, followed by mixing controlled combustion. This
represented an improvement in combustion phasing by advancing the
SoI in case of E50 under higher compression ratio conditions.

4.3. Ethanol Injectors and Sprays

The challenge of poor air-fuel mixing and high ID can be addressed

by designing optimized fuel injectors for ethanol injection in advanced
engines. As a solution, electrospraying could be a potential fuel injection
method  that  can  be  used  for  developing  port  fuel  injectors.  Electro-
spraying is a liquid atomization process that applies an electric field to
produce  the  mono-dispersed  particles.  It  has  several  advantages  over
conventional spray, i.e. (a) the operating pressure is much lower than
the  conventional  spray,  (b)  the  droplet  size  is  independent  of  nozzle
geometry and therefore straightforward for design and fabrication, (c)
the spray angle can be changed without affecting the droplet size dis-
tribution,  (d)  cost  of  the  nozzle  is  lower  compared  to  conventional
nozzle, (e) the droplets are mono-dispersed in nature. Gan et al. [145]
conducted  an  experimental  study  on  ethanol  electrospraying  in  a
microscale  combustor.  They  observed  that  a  nozzle-ring  system  pro-
duced smaller, more uniform droplets than the nozzle-grid system. Jiang
et al. [146] conducted an experimental study on the combustion char-
acteristics of an ethanol-biodiesel blend in a mesoscale combustor. They
reported decreased droplet size and lower CO emission due to ethanol
blending.  Gupta  et  al.  [147]  reported  the  hydrodynamics  of  ethanol
electrospray under both DC and AC actuation. Chen et al. [148] con-
ducted an experimental study on electrospray counterflow combustion
of  ethanol  in  a  new  type  of  combustor  with  a  porous  media  as  the
grounding  electrode.  Zuo  et  al.  [149]  studied  droplet  combustion  for
ethanol,  diesel,  and  biodiesel  under  electric  fields.  Chandran  [150]
carried out a combined simulation and experimental study on the design
of multi-nozzle electrospray. Fig. 29 shows a schematic of the experi-
mental setup for generating and visualizing electrospray. Fig. 30 shows
the  images  of  a  linear  and  hexagonal  arrangement  of  electrospraying
nozzles. It shows the effectiveness of multiple nozzle configuration de-
signs in electrospray operation, which is critical for engine applications.
Singh [151] studied the role of a spherical cap in electrospray design and
demonstrated its effectiveness in the electrospray of a binary mixture of
ethanol  and  water.  This  study  can  be  extended  for  electrospray  of
ethanol  and  other  fuel,  i.e.,  diesel  mixtures.  The  spherical  cap  is
observed to increase the operational range, i.e., the flow rate range of
electrospray.

High-pressure swirl injectors were used by Wang et al. [152] to study
the spray characteristics of ethanol. One must use a specially designed
injector to study diesel-ethanol blend spray characteristics at very high
FIP  [153].  It  was  found  that  ethanol-diesel  blends  form  shorter  and
expanded  sprays  than  diesel  only,  while  FIP  exceeds  a  high  critical
value.

As  a  solution,  electrospraying  could  be  a  potential  fuel  injection
method  that  can  be  used  for  developing  port  fuel  injectors  for  high-
volatility  fuels  like  ethanol.  The  fuel  is  atomized  by  overcoming  its
surface tension using electric stress. Fine droplets (micron size) can be

generated using this method. The droplet size and distribution can be
controlled by changing the voltage. Proof of concept for low flow rates
per nozzle hole has also been developed. Waits et al. [154] could pro-
duce droplets of 4 μm diameter. Maximum flow densities up to 2800 cc

per nozzle for ethanol. A minimum droplet surface temperature of 26
C
is required for ethanol. The focus is increasing the flow rate needed for
engine  applications  using  a  spherical  cap  and  multi-nozzle  connected
after a porous media.

4.4. Ethanol-ammonia engines

Dual-fuel combustion and high compression ratio operations are the
ways to improve the use of ethanol in compression engines. Adding a
carbon-free fuel such as ammonia to ethanol could be a way to decar-
bonize even more, especially since both fuels are miscible in liquid phase
making the storage easier.

Pele et al. [155] indicated that combining ethanol—ammonia in SI
engines enhances efficiency (Fig. 31 [155]). For example, 20 % v/v. of
ammonia in ethanol increased the efficiency by 1 % compared to 100 %
ethanol but by 2 % compared to 100 % CH4. However, NOx emisisons
need to be mitigated.

5. Ammonia for sustainable transport

This section describes ammonia’s candidacy as a clean thermal en-
ergy  carrier,  shedding  light  on  its  combustion  properties  and  perfor-
mance  in  various  engine  configurations.  Exploration  of  ammonia  for
transport  applications  remains  pertinent  and  merits  continued  in-
vestigations. In 2014, ammonia was declared as a very promising fuel for
IC engines by researchers at Oxford [156], with its complete combustion
being CO2-free. In 2024, several car and truck manufacturers (Toyota,
GAC, Hyundai, and Faw Trucks) intended to develop efficient and clean
ammonia  engines.  Since  the  first  presentation  of  their  roadmap  for
decarbonizing the maritime sector in 2019, the IMO has influenced the
strategy of marine engine manufacturers (MAN, Wartsila, Win GD, IHI
power systems or China Shipbuilding Power) considering ammonia as a
carbon-free fuel. Ammonia is mainly obtained from hydrogen through
the Haber-Bossch process, which is a century-old process [157].

Ammonia is also labelled in various colours based the feedstock used,
as shown in Fig. 32 [108], such as brown ammonia (coal as feedstock),
grey ammonia (natural gas as feedstock), blue ammonia (blue hydrogen
as  feedstock),  E-ammonia  (renewable  electricity  as  feedstock),  and
green ammonia (biomass as feedstock). Therefore, NH3  should be pro-
duced  from  renewable  energy  sources  such  as  hydrogen  to  consider
ammonia as a fully carbon-free fuel candidate. On the other hand, the
Haber-Bosch process remains energy-expensive even if it is unique and
efficient  process.  Recent  studies  focussed  on  producing  NH3,  for
example, directly from water electrolysis, avoiding the hydrogen step or

5.2. IC engines fueled with ammonia

by considering the biogenic route [158] since NH3  can be directly ob-
tained from gasifying nitrogenous-rich feedstocks such as manure [159]
but  many  innovative  solutions  are  emerging.  Among  its  advantages,
ammonia is easily storable as is liquid at ~9 bar and ambient temper-
◦
ature or at (cid:0) 33
C and ambient pressure. Its narrow flammability limits
make it safer from explosion risks compared to hydrogen. However on
the other hand, it is highly corrosive (especially for copper alloys) and
toxic. Ammonia is considered the best hydrogen carrier for developing a
hydrogen future.

5.1. Properties of Ammonia as a fuel for IC engines

Despite  its  low  reactivity,  mainly  due  to  its  low  Laminar  Burning
Velocity (LBV),  higher auto-ignition temperature, and  narrower flam-
mability limits, as shown in Table 5, ammonia presents a LHV compa-
rable to methanol and an energy content per kg of air more significant
than any conventional hydrocarbon fuels and alcohols, making it a po-
tential candidate to decarbonize IC engines.

Considering its very low LBV, the blending of NH3 with more reactive
fuels  such  as  methane,  hydrogen,  or  ethanol  [160–162]  is  widely
covered in the open literature, not only in terms of LBV improvement but
also on the flame stability and stretch resistivity improvement, charac-
terized by fundamental properties such as the expansion ratio, Zeldovich
and Lewis numbers, and Markstein length. However, when used as IC
engine  fuel,  as  a  function  of  operating  conditions,  promising  perfor-
mances can be obtained, comparable to natural gas [163].

Several  engine  configurations  are  possible  as  a  function  of  the  in-
jection and ignition systems as shown in Fig. 33 [164] and Fig. 34, (i) A
SI  mode  with  the  potential  addition  of  a  small  amount  of  hydrogen,
derived  from  an  on-board  ammonia  cracker,  to  help  its  combustion
[165],  (ii)  CI  mode  with  reactive  fuel  pilot  injection  to  initiate  com-
bustion under high compression ratios [166,167].

The study by Won et al. [168] underscores promising outcomes in SI
engines,  offering  a  glimpse  into  the  viability  of  ammonia  as  a
zero-carbon fuel. The NOx emissions can also be controlled by adjusting
the Air Fuel Ratio (AFR) in ammonia fuelled SI engines (Fig. 35 [168]).
The combustion exhaust emissions from an ammonia-fueled SI engines
primarily include unburnt NH3, NOx, and N2O, which all have adverse
environmental and health impacts [169].

To favour the use of ammonia as a fuel for transport, the develop-
ment of technologies or strategies allowing NH3 to be the sole fuel, i.e.,
having only one fuel tank, should be promoted. Due to its higher auto-
ignition  temperature  and  ON,  ammonia  is  highly  resistant  to  knock,
enabling  the  possibility  of  increasing  the  compression  ratio  of  the  SI
engines. This increase can increase the ITE and the extend the engine
operating limits [170]. Another possible solution is using an onboard
cracker to partly dissociate the ammonia into a blend of NH3/H2/N2, as
shown 10 years ago by Comotti and Frigo [171] and recently by Toyota
Group [172]. This solution helps ensure ignition and stable operation
even if energy output and global efficiency are reduced, especially if the
energy required to crack the ammonia is considered [173].

Regarding the emissions, it reduces the ammonia slip but can lead to
emission of unburnt H2  in the exhaust and an increase of N2O [174].

corresponds to a 1.5 % CO2  equivalent level since the global warming
potential of N2O is about 265 times greater than that of CO2. Another
solution  to  ensure  stable  operation  and  ignition  is  using  an  active
pre-chamber (PC) igniter to generate a highly turbulent jet flame with
active radicals in the Main Chamber (MC). Most studies investigated H2
as the PC fuel, contradicting the “one tank” strategy [175–177].

Despite presenting a higher efficiencies in the SI engines, the CI en-
gines are almost impossible to operate when fueled with only ammonia
due to its ignition properties. A pilot injection of a more reactive diesel-
like fuel is one promising solution to ignite and ensure stable operation.
Recent studies concluded that the energy share from this pilot injection
could be as low as 5 %. However, the best compromise has to be made
regarding performance, pollutant emissions, and carbon footprint [178,
179]. For such applications, as N2O is formed at a lower temperature
than NO but in a wide range of equivalence ratio, the optimization of
diesel  energy  share  will  be  a  function  of  local  ammonia/air/diesel
mixture.  Splitting  of  the  pilot  injection  can  enhance  the  local  mixing
[180].

For example, a recent study [181] compared the performance and
emissions in the same single-cylinder ammonia-fueled CI engine ignited
by a spark plug or a dodecane pilot injection for 8 bar IMEP at 1000 rpm.
Higher efficiency was obtained with dodecane ignition, but a slightly
higher carbon footprint impact was obtained, as seen in Fig. 36 [182].

Therefore,  to  improve  the  decarbonization  of  such  engines,  the
reactive species to enhance ammonia ignition has to be renewable, for
example, hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) obtained from waste or DME
[183].

Even  with  the  best  unburnt  ammonia-NOx  compromise,  post-
treatment systems such as Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) or/and
ammonia slip catalysts should be added. There has been commendable
progress  in  developing  catalyst-based  solutions  for  ammonia-fueled
vehicles to meet stringent emission standards. Ammonia oxidation (or
destruction)  and  NOx  reduction  catalysts  offer  effective  solutions  to
control  both  ammonia  and  NOx  emissions.  Some  manufacturers  have
claimed  that  NH3  destruction  catalysts  with  oxidation  and  reductive
functionality  can  effectively  decompose  ammonia  while  minimizing
NOx  and  N2O.  The technology  is  already  used  for  industrial  emission
control.  High  water  content  in  the  products  of  ammonia  combustion
remains a function of the operating conditions, hence water can act as an
inhibitor in SCR systems, as recently studied [184]. However, catalyst
manufacturers also demonstrated the durability of NH3  decomposition
catalysts under high moisture. Challenges to the long-term stability of
the catalysts could also be related to the NH3/NOx ratio as a function of
operating conditions [185].

In  this  way,  quite  similar  to  the  decades-proven  emission  control
strategies  through  engine  modifications,  fuel  blends,  and  exhaust  gas
after-treatment catalyst-based system appear to be in place to meet the
challenges  of  ammonia-powered  engines.  Recent  advancements  in

bifunctional  catalyst  compositions  and  functional  substrates  offer  po-
tential opportunities for further research and close-to-ready solutions for
emission control from E-fuel-powered ICengines.

5.3. The challenges of ammonia/air mixing

The local air/fuel mixture and, therefore, the choices of injections
(liquid or vapour, in the intake port or directly in the chamber) are key
parameters  for  minimizing  pollutant  emissions  and  fuel  consumption
[186].  In  the  case  of  gaseous  injection,  the  dynamics  of  a  gaseous
ammonia jet are similar to those of methane [187]. Still, the injector
must be optimized for a sufficient ammonia flow rate due to the different
air/fuel  ratios  (see  Table  5).  The  benefit  of  direct  liquid  injection,  as
opposed to port fuel injection, lies in aiding engine filling and rapidly
vaporizing the fuel within the chamber by dispersing the fuel spray into
droplets. Long back, Gray et al. [188] examined the spray characteristics
of  ammonia  from  a  diesel  injector  with  an  initial  rapid  investigation
under atmospheric conditions showing that the shape of the ammonia
spray  from  the  following  AKB  50S-type  nozzle  holder  and  30S-3-1
pintle-type  nozzle  was  close  to  that  of  a  diesel-type  spray.  However,
during this investigations, frequent injection nozzle sticking occurred in
the  ammonia  system,  sometimes  even  after  a  minimal  duration  of
operation.

Moreover, the high latent heat of vaporization of NH3 (1163 kJ/kg vs
877 kJ//kg for ethanol) implies a substantial cooling of the combustion
chamber, which can affect the spray pattern. In this regard, the study of
ammonia spray is crucial. Due to the specific vapour pressure curve and
the MC pressure, in most cases, the atomization process for ammonia
injection in an engine is affected by the flash-boiling mechanism. This
phenomenon is responsible for the narrower and longer ammonia sprays
than gasoline, as seen in Fig. 37 [189]. The ‘instantaneous’ boiling in-
duces the collapse of different jets.

Fig. 38 [190] compares the mass fraction distribution of ammonia in
the vapour phase at distances of 10, 20 and 30 mm below the injector
nozzle for two ambient pressures.

The first one, lower than the saturation pressure of ammonia (2 bar),
can correspond to the ammonia direct injection conditions in a current
Direct Injection SI engine (for a Compression ratio ~10–11) and a SoI
during  the  intake  stroke.  The  second  one,  higher  than  the  saturation
pressure  (15  bar),  can  correspond  to  a  direct  injection  during  the
compression stroke of a high compression ratio engine. In the case of 2
bar,  there  is  a  higher  concentration  of  ammonia  vapour,  which  even
exceeds 20 % of the mass fraction, whereas, in the case of 15 bar, the
amount of ammonia vapour is negligible, reaching maximum values of
~5 %.

6. Low-carbon fuels

6.1. Enhancing Air Quality and Combustion Efficiency

Carbon emission reduction, lower GHG emissions, energy security,
improving the ambient air quality, and decarbonization are the moti-
vations for using low-carbon fuels in the transport sector [191]. Using
low-carbon  fuels  in  the  transport  sector  is  crucial  for  mitigating  the
environmental impact of conventional fossil fuels [192]. Scientists have
actively  investigated  the  implementation  of  these  fuels  in  IC  engines,
including biofuels, hydrogen, natural gas, and algae-based fuels [193].
Promoting the adoption of these low-carbon fuels in the transport sector
is essential for achieving climate goals and reducing the overall envi-
ronmental  impact  of  transport  activities.  Transitioning  to  these  alter-
natives  requires  infrastructure  development,  policy  support,  and
industry collaboration [194]. To ensure sustainability, the by-products
of combustion could be repurposed into the fuel system with minimal
environmental impact, preventing pollution and waste through circular
economy practices [195].

Interim Solutions for Air Quality Improvement and Energy Produc-
tion: Alongside the objective of achieving net zero carbon emissions, it is
imperative to explore interim solutions that can enhance the air quality
index  in  various  countries.  In  this  context,  investigations  have  been
conducted on producer gas, compressed biogas, and alcohol-based fuels.
Optimal  energy  production  involves  two  crucial  factors:  centralized
energy  production  and  optimized  local  solutions.  The  properties  of
producer gas are contingent upon the biomass thermal conversion pro-
cess type, including feedstock characteristics, reactor type, and critical
operating parameters [82]. Fig. 39 [196] illustrates different types of
gasifiers, which can lead to the varying compositions in Table 6.

The impact of raw syngas composition on combustion characteristics
was meticulously examined, particularly for SI engines [199,200] and
ignition through diesel pilot fuel injection in a CI engine [201]. This is
illustrated in Fig. 40 [202], which represents the evolution of combus-
tion, BTE, and pollutant emissions as a function of equivalence ratio of
the premixed syngas/air charge for different syngas compositions shown
in Table 6.

6.2. Spray dynamics of low carbon fuels

7. Engine modelling and efficiency improvement

One viable approach to meet the legislative low carbon requirements
is  using  E-fuels.  With  this  motivation,  renewable  alcohol-based  fuels,
such  as  ethanol,  methanol,  and  butanol,  blended  with  baseline  con-
ventional fuels at 15 % (v/v), were widely investigated for microscopic
spray characteristics and particulates [203].

Fig.  41 [204]  depicts  a  piston-cylinder,  focusing  on  a  single  fuel
droplet to simplify explaining the processes involved in a firing engine.
In the combustion chamber, where temperatures and pressures are high,
the  droplet  first  heats  up,  expands,  and  evaporates.  The  authors  con-
ducted real-time evaluations and comparative studies of droplet size and
velocity distributions in a GDI optical engine combustion chamber and
in a constant volume spray chamber (CVSC). The results demonstrate
that the fuel-air mixture, droplet size distributions and velocity within
the engine chamber were influenced by fuel density, viscosity, surface
tension, and the mixing rate with intake air, which was affected by air
temperature  and  pressure.  Furthermore,  while  smaller  micron-sized
droplets  were  more  prevalent  in  the  engine  chamber,  they  tend  to
evaporate quickly. This work is pivotal for advancing combustion effi-
ciency, reducing emissions, and contributing to the goal of mitigating
carbon-based emissions in the transport sector.

Fuel vaporization and mixing are crucial for the efficient combustion
of low-carbon fuels. Fig. 42 [205] shows the details of spray and com-
bustion images highlighting changes in spray boundaries with changes
in  the  in-cylinder  pressure.  Once  the  spray  disintegrates,  the  injected
fuel vaporizes from its surface, expanding and later displaced by trailing
droplets, resulting in a vapour concentration at the edges. The vapor-
ization  rate is  affected by the FIP, where  increased FIP facilitates the
breakdown of larger spray droplets, improving their mixing with air.

Alcohols can also be blended with diesel-like fuels. Blending alcohols
with  diesel-like  fuels  presents  a  potential  pathway  for  creating  more
sustainable  fuel  options.  Macroscopic  and  microscopic  spray  charac-
teristics  of  low-carbon  fuel  can  be  investigated  using  various  optical
techniques in high-temperature, high-pressure environment in constant-
volume combustion chambers. The SMD of biodiesel was higher than
conventional fuels, resulting in an increased soot concentration due to
inferior  spray  atomization.  However,  the  incorporation  of  alcohol
blends in diesel-like fuels decreases the soot concentration.

The  process  of  a  fuel  droplet  interactions  with  ambient  air  in  a
combustion chamber, detailing its heating, expansion, and evaporation
within a firing engine, can also be explored with emphasis on real-time
measurements  in  different  chamber  environments,  showcasing  the
impact of fuel properties on droplet behaviour. This research is pivotal
for  enhancing  combustion  efficiency  and  reducing  emissions,  illus-
trating the potential of low-carbon fuels in reducing the soot concen-
tration.  Apart  from  fundamental  studies,the  direct  implementation  of
low-carbon fuels like syngas and alcohols in combating climate change
is significant [206]. Strategies such as enhanced research investments,
policy supports like carbon pricing, and stakeholder collaborations in
implementing E-fuels are essential to facilitate the transition to a sus-
tainable future.

7.1. Engine modelling for E-fuels and biofuels

E-fuels have emerged as a viable alternative to conventional fossil
fuels and support sustainable mobility growth towards net zero emis-
sions [60]. The basic building block of E-fuel is a synthetic compound of
carbon and Hydrogen. In E-fuel, carbon is sourced directly from the air
or industries. At the same time, green Hydrogen is produced by chem-
ically breaking down water, utilizing renewable energy sources such as
solar,  hydro,  or  wind  [207].  The  synthesis  process  initiates  with  the
creation of a crude oil substitute. These substitute can then be refined
into  various forms, such as petrol, diesel,  jet  fuel, lubricants, or  wax.
E-fuels  offer significant  advantages, including convenient  storage  and
transport capabilities, even over long distances. While E-fuels contribute
to limiting CO2 emissions, the emitted CO2 can be equivalent to the CO2
captured and utilized in producing E-fuels.

In  the  quest  for  sustainable  transport  and  environmental  re-
sponsibility, engine modelling for E-fuels and biofuels has been recog-
nized as a vital tool [208]. Researchers can understand the engine and
fuel  compatibility  by  meticulously  modelling  engine  behaviour  and
performance with various fuel compositions. This meticulous approach
involves  simulating  complex  interactions  between  fuels  and  engine
components to achieve the following objectives:

●  Design and optimize combustion processes: accurately simulating
interactions  allows  for  designing  and  optimizing  combustion  pro-
cesses  engineered  explicitly  for  E-fuels  and  biofuels,  leading  to
improved fuel efficiency and emission control.

●  Identify areas for improvement: engine modelling helps pinpoint
areas  where  enhancements  can  be  made  in  energy  utilization  and
efficiency, leading to cleaner and more sustainable engines.

●  Develop  real-time  control  strategies:  This  modelling  approach
underpins the development of real-time control strategies, allowing
dynamic adjustments to optimize engine performance and minimize
emissions in real-world conditions.

Critical aspects of engine modelling for E-fuels and biofuels include a
comprehensive understanding of fuel properties, encompassing chemi-
cal composition and thermodynamic characteristics [209]. The chemical
composition  involves  HCs, oxygenates,  and  other additives.  Addition-
ally,  it’s  crucial  to  investigate  the  fuel’s  thermodynamic  properties,
including  specific  heat,  enthalpy,  and  combustion  characteristics.  In
addition  to  the  aspects  mentioned  above,  combustion  modelling  of
E-fuels  entails  the  development  of  detailed  combustion  chemistry
models  to  simulate  the  combustion  process  accurately.  This  involves
considering  reactions,  intermediate  species,  and  the  formation  of
pollutants.

7.1.1. Engine modelling classification

Engine modelling classification entails categorizing the various ap-
proaches  and  techniques  to  simulate  and  assess  engine  performance.
This classification can be broadly segmented into several categories:

a) Physical Modelling: This approach focuses on detailed representa-
tion of engine components and processes, incorporating principles of
thermodynamics and fluid dynamics. It frequently utilized CFD and

finite  element  analysis  (FEA)  to  simulate  the  physical  phenomena
occurring within the engine.

b)  Data-Driven Modelling: This method relied on historical data and
statistical  techniques  to  create  predictive  models  without  needing
detailed  physical  representations.  Techniques  such  as  Artificial
Neural Network (ANN) and Extreme Learning Machines fall into this
category,  enabling  efficient  predictions  based  on  the  relationships
between inputs and outputs.

c)  Black-Box  Modelling:  This  approach  regarded  the  engine  as  a
"black-box,"  concentrating  on  the  relationship  between  input  vari-
ables (such as fuel properties and operating conditions) and output
metrics  (like  performance  indicators)  without  exploring  internal
mechanisms.  It  proved  helpful  in  analyzing  complex  interactions
involving alternative fuels [210].

d)  Empirical Modelling: Empirical models emerged from experimental
data and observations, establishing relationships based on measured
performance. This approach often employed regression analysis to
derive mathematical equations representing engine behaviour.

e)  Hybrid Modelling: By combining elements from physical and data-
driven methods, hybrid modelling sought to leverage the strengths of
each approach. It integrated empirical data with physical principles
to enhance model accuracy and reliability.

Engine modelling for E-fuels and biofuels is a complex process that
necessitates collaboration among researchers, engineers, and scientists
from  various  fields,  including  chemistry,  thermodynamics,  and  fluid
dynamics. Advanced simulation tools and computational models play a
crucial role in expediting the development and optimization of engines
for alternative fuels. Although E-fuels are currently more expensive than
conventional fuels, they offer a promising, long-term, sustainable solu-
tion for reducing environmental impact and advancing towards carbon-

Among the multiple possibilities for new alternative clean fuels, E-
fuels  and  biofuels  are  among  the  most  promising  in  fulfilling  future
expectations with negligible carbon footprint and high efficiency. For
the transport sector, decarbonization relies on them. The E-fuel can be
blended with diesel and used with the existing engine technology as they
exhibit  similar  injection  and  atomization  characteristics.  Hence,  it
shows a new, cleaner pathway for sustainable and scalable fuels with/
without engine modifications.

Integrating engine models with vehicle simulations for LCA presents
a  multifaceted  challenge  due  to  complex  interaction  of  components
within the transport ecosystem. Beyond assessing engine performance
and  emissions,  this  integration  demands  a  holistic  consideration  of
various  factors  influencing  the  transport  system’s  overall  energy con-
sumption  and  environmental  footprint.  These  factors  include  vehicle
mass,  aerodynamic  drag,  transmission  efficiency,  and  diverse  driving
profiles,  significantly  shaping  vehicles’  operational  dynamics  and
environmental  impacts  [212].  As  such,  a  comprehensive  modelling
framework must capture the complexities inherent in real-world trans-
port scenarios to assess sustainability and efficiency accurately.

The  complexity  further  escalates  when  considering  the  diverse
operating  conditions  and  usage  scenarios  vehicles  encounter  [213].
From congested urban streets to long-haul highway journeys, vehicles
operate under various conditions, each with challenges and implications
for  performance  and  emissions.  Understanding  and  modelling  these
conditions  is  crucial  for  obtaining  meaningful  insights  into  the  envi-
ronmental impact of transport systems over their entire life. Moreover, it
necessitates  the  development  of  robust  simulation  methodologies
capable  of  accurately  representing  the  dynamic  interactions  between
vehicles, drivers, and the surrounding environment.

A  key  aspect  of  LCA  in  transport  sector  requires  comprehensive
evaluation of environmental impacts across all vehicle life stages, from
manufacturing to disposal [68]. This involves assessing the operational
phase and considering upstream processes, such as fuel production and
distribution, and downstream processes, such as vehicle recycling and

To  tackle  these  challenges,  advanced  simulation  tools  and  data-
driven approaches play a pivotal role. Computational techniques such
as CFD, FEA, and agent-based modelling enable researchers to simulate
complex  interactions  and  optimize  vehicle  designs  for  improved  per-
formance  and  environmental sustainability. Because of  its lower  time
and resource requirements, CFD modelling is an appealing alternative to
the experimental technique, particularly for engine hardware improve-
ment.  Therefore,  it  is  worthwhile  to  create  an  optimization  approach
based  on  CFD  modelling  that  can  be  used  to  both  qualitatively  and
quantitatively identify the most pertinent impacts of the variables to be
optimized  (inputs)  and  to  define  the  ideal  engine  hardware/settings
combination [214]. Modelling inside CFD simulations of CI engines is
critical because the E-fuel mix and characteristics substantially impact
engine  performance.  Predictive  modelling  of  fuel  chemistry  can  be
achieved  with  modern,  detailed  chemical  mechanisms  that  include
detailed  descriptions  of  the  elementary  reaction  pathways.  However,
these  mechanisms  are  typically  computationally  too  expensive  for
computational engine design and CFD, and they are frequently limited
to  single  fuel  components  or  simple  component  mixtures  [215]. Soft-
wares  have  several  options  for  modelling  sub-grid  phenomena,
including spray breakup and atomization, droplet drag, collisions, coa-

Additionally,  machine  learning  (ML)  has  emerged  as  a  promising
tool  for  various  applications  within  IC  engine  research,  including
modelling [217–220], control [221,222], and optimization [223–225]
(Fig. 44 [226]). The inherent complexity and nonlinearity of IC engine
processes pose challenges for prediction, control, and optimization using
traditional  physics-based  or  data-driven  approaches.  ML  techniques
offer robust solutions to these challenges by providing insights into IC
engine behaviour and facilitating improved modelling accuracy.

One  of  the  critical  advantages  of  ML  is  its  ability  to  significantly

reduce the time, cost, and effort associated with IC engine calibration for
both automotive and stationary applications. Researchers can stream-
line  the  calibration  process  by  leveraging  ML  algorithms,  leading  to
more  efficient  engine  performance  and  reduced  emissions.  Moreover,
ML enables the development of augmented IC engine control strategies,
such as optimal and adaptive control methods [227], which enhance the
responsiveness and adaptability of engine systems in varying operating
conditions.  Numerous  statistical  approaches  that  may  be  applied  to
condition-based engine maintenance are included in the broad category
of ML [228]. A classifier is often trained using one of two methods in ML:
supervised  learning, which  builds  a model using  known input/output
pairings  to  forecast  future  output,  and  unsupervised  learning,  which
finds  patterns  in  the  input  data  without  labelling.  Since  an  artificial
neural  network  (ANN)  is  a  valuable  tool  for  accounting  for  dynamic
transitions  and  the  engine’s  nonlinear  characteristics,  and  since  it  is
simple to configure when switching between engines, it is employed in
conjunction with supervised learning [229].

ANNs  are  mathematical  models  that  mimic  biological  neural  net-
works’ computational capabilities. They have been employed in scien-
tific research to tackle challenging problems or conventional numerical
approaches and to model complicated systems. By allowing computers
to replicate the operations of the human nervous system using actual
data, ANNs serve a critical role in artificial intelligence by aiding with
data  prediction  and  fitting  [230].  ANN  modelling  utilized  inter-
connected neurons to analyze patterns and make predictions based on
historical data to enhance prediction accuracy for optimizing E-fuels and
biofuels  in  engine  performance  analysis  [231],  and  also  extreme
learning machine modelling employed a single hidden layer of neurons
with random weights, enabling rapid learning and high prediction ac-
curacy for optimizing engine performance with E-fuels and biofuels. The
black-box  modelling  approach  (Fig.  43 [232])  predicted  HD  vehicle
performance by analyzing the relationship between input variables and
fuel consumption. It focused on various renewable fuel blend properties,
such  as  LHV,  density,  viscosity,  and  cetane  number.  This  method
enabled robust predictions of BSFC and emissions, assisting fleet oper-
ators in managing costs and optimizing vehicle performance effectively.
Artificial  intelligence  techniques’  flexibility  and  generalization  ca-
pabilities, including black-box neural network models, enable the res-
olution  of  nonlinear  complex  and  dynamic
issues.
Comprehensive engine testing under different operating circumstances
for  E-fuels  and  biofuels  is  costly  and  time-consuming,  in  addition  to
significantly impacting the combustion characteristics due to difficulties
in precisely predicting. New combustion diagnostic techniques with in-
cylinder pressure analysis and its extraction parameters are becoming
increasingly  necessary  without  requiring  extensive  engine  testing

procedures to guarantee compliance with the higher emission criteria
with alternative diesel fuels [233].

Furthermore,  ML  enhances  existing  physics-based  models  through
grey-box  modelling  approaches  [234].  Grey-box  modelling  is  an
approach that integrates both theoretical knowledge and empirical data
to create a comprehensive model. Grey-box models are precious in en-
gine modelling because they combine the physical laws governing en-
gine  behaviour  with  data-driven  techniques  to  enhance  accuracy  and
reliability  [235].  For  instance,  in  HCCI  engines,  grey-box  models  can
predict  critical  parameters  such  as  combustion  phasing,  IMEP,  and
exhaust gas temperature by merging physical engine models with ANN
[236]. This hybrid approach allows for precise control and optimization
of  engine  performance  and  emissions,  making  it  a  powerful  tool  for
real-time applications and improving overall engine efficiency.

An ANN learns and executes certain tasks, such as pattern recogni-
tion and categorization. Neural networks come in a variety of forms, and
each one is tailored to a certain goal. A feedforward neural network, a
multiple-layer perceptron  neural network,  is employed for supervised
learning. It is made up of many processing units that resemble neurons
arranged  in  layers  known  as  hidden  layers.  Weight  is  represented  by
each neuronal connection to the neurons in the subsequent layer. Data
entered  at  the  input  layer  of  the  feed-forward  neural  network  is  pro-
cessed at the hidden layers before reaching the output layer [237].

The support vector machine approach is an essential and valuable
technique for regression and classification. A subset of support vector
regression  (SVR)  that  deals  with  function  estimation  and  regression
problems is called SVR. Due to its straightforward structure and ease of
implementation,  SVR  has  been  used  in  many  sectors  and  has  seen
tremendous  advancement.  In  contrast  to  other  AI  techniques,  SVR
avoids  the  "dimension  curse"  and  lowers  computing  costs  since  its
computational  complexity  is  based  on  the  number  of  support  vectors
rather than the dimensions of the input data. Additionally, SVR is more
resilient to noisy input than other sophisticated ML algorithms like an
ANN [238]. Researchers can improve model accuracy and reliability by
integrating ML techniques with physics-based models, enhancing pre-
dictive capabilities for IC engine behaviour. Additionally, using ML in
conjunction  with  cloud  computing  and  vehicle-to-infrastructure  (V2I)
communications offers opportunities for further performance improve-
ments in IC engines [239]. ML-enabled IC engine systems can optimize
performance, reduce energy consumption, and minimize environmental
impact by leveraging real-time data exchange and cloud-based analytics.
By  leveraging  these  tools  and  methodologies,  researchers  can
develop comprehensive models that provide valuable insights into the
environmental sustainability of transport systems and inform decision-
making processes to transition towards a more sustainable future.

Moreover,  among  chemical  species  found  in  fuels,  those  from  the
aromatic family have specific effects on combustion and emissions. They
affect fuel properties and influence atomization, mixture formation, and
combustion. Alkyl benzenes, for instance, should be preferred as lower
emissions can be expected, although toxicity must be considered.

In this context, there is a need for extensive studies for simulations
and experiments to gain fundamental knowledge of physical processes
as a step into developing clean fuel engines. Suggesting the development
of a comprehensive database of fuel properties and combustion kinetics
for a broader range of E-fuels and Biofuels would highlight a valuable
area for future R&D.

Combustion research in engines, guided by the fundamental princi-
ples  of  chemical  kinetics  and  thermodynamics,  is  typically  organized
into four hierarchical development levels, as described in Fig. 45 [241].
The  first  level  focuses  on  quantum  chemistry  calculations  and  direct
kinetic  measurements  of  rate  constants  for  key  reactions  driving  the
combustion  of  specific  fuels.  These  calculations  and  measurements
provide the essential data needed for accurate combustion modelling.
The  emphasis  shifts  to  the  fuel’s  structure  and  core  chemistry  at  the
second level. The species and reactions identified in the first level are
integrated  into  detailed  kinetic  mechanisms  that  map  out  complete

reaction  pathways  during  combustion  in  engine  conditions.  These
mechanisms  are  validated  through  experimental  setups  such  as  rapid
compression machines (RCMs), high-pressure shock tubes (HPSTs), jet
stirred reactors (JSRs), and flow reactors (FRs). The third level involves
CFD  simulations.  Here,  the  detailed  chemical  kinetic  mechanisms are
reduced to simplified versions containing fewer species and elementary
reactions  that  retain  fundamental  properties  such  as  ID,  flame  speed,
and  emissions  behaviour  necessary  for  practical  engine  modelling.
These  reduced  mechanisms  are  incorporated  into  CFD  simulations  to
study  engine  performance  across  various  operating  conditions.  The
fourth and final level focuses on designing more effective and efficient
engines by applying the insights gained from CFD simulations, paving
the way for improved engine technologies.

The  significance  of  engine  modelling  in  advancing  sustainable
transport through E-fuels and biofuels is increasing daily with system
complexity.  Collaboration  among  researchers  and  the  utilization  of
advanced  simulation  tools  are  needed  to  use  these  advancements  for
engine  development.  Additionally,  integrating  engine  models  with
vehicle simulations to assess their life cycle and address environmental
impacts will increase development speed. ML-based modelling has huge
potential  to  enhance  engine  research,  calibration,  and  control.
Furthermore, investigations of fuel chemical properties and establishing
comprehensive databases for future studies are also recommended for
using these tools for engine development.

7.2. Towards high-efficiency clean engines

Whatever is the primary energy source for transport, effective pow-
ertrains  are  required  if  the  cost  of  energy  increases.  All  scenarios  for
future  energy  production  converge  on  a  higher  energy  cost  as  fossil
deposits  are  more  difficult  to  exploit,  and  renewable  resources  have
lower  energy  production  ratios  [242].  It  is  necessary,  therefore,  to
imagine more energy-efficient powertrains and engines as future fuels,
whether  green  hydrogen,  ammonia,  or  biofuels,  will  undoubtedly  be
more  expensive
than  historical  oil  production.  Focusing  on
high-efficiency clean engines and evaluating the competitive landscape
for a new design of high-efficiency future IC engines with other solutions
such as battery and fuel cell-based electric transport is a crucial strategy
for  developing  low-carbon  viable  engine-based  prime  movers  for  the
transport sector. An evaluation of electric motors and fuel cells reveals
their efficiency but highlights the cost and challenges of precious metal
usage.

Moreover, the environmental impact of electrified vehicles is directly
dependent on electricity production-related emissions. Therefore, fully
electric or fuel cell-powered vehicles can be envisioned only in countries
or regions where  low-carbon electricity (and hydrogen) production is

implemented  (or  planned  in  the  short  term).  To  set  some  figures,  an
estimate for nuclear-based electricity production is around 12 g of CO2
per  KWh,  compared  to  820  g  per  KWh  for  coal-based  electricity  pro-
duction [243]. It is, therefore, clear that the electrification of vehicles
cannot be envisioned without a more extensive policy concerning elec-
tricity production routes and availability. The potential of IC engines in
the future is contingent on efficiency improvements (55 %) and close to
zero  emissions.  To  reach  those  efficiency  levels,  several  engine  func-
tioning aspects must be addressed. Combustion development has been
the focus of many engine-related studies to combine high-efficiency and
low emissions [244].

The fundamentals of architecture and the thermodynamic cycle must
be addressed for higher efficiency. Three pivotal levers of action were
identified: optimized expansion, cooled compression, a regenerator to
preheat  gas,  and  the  elimination  of  throttles,  incorporating  variable
valve activation (VVA) to mitigate pumping loss [245–249]. The stra-
tegies for advanced valve actuation systems entail hardware modifica-
tions,  eliminating  throttles,  implementing  VVA,  and  adopting  a  fully
flexible  valve  actuation  system  suitable  for  enhanced  efficiency.  The
overarching  objective  remains  the  achievement  of  cleaner  and  more
efficient engines, coupled with a reduction in the cost of emission con-
trol. Fig. 46 [250] shows the BSFC map of the 5-stroke engine proposed
by Keromn`es et al. [250]. Coupling the IC engine to an electric drive
allows the ideal functioning of the IC engine to be maintained close to its
nominal maximum efficiency point in the frame of hybrid powertrains.
It also allows the specific design of engines that do not need important
regime and torque variations, permitting BSFC optimization.

Addressing NOx and soot emissions, particularly in the exhaust gas
after-treatment systems, is acknowledged as a challenge. The discussion
involves  catalytic  emission  control  from  combustion  sources,  consid-
ering solutions such as new E-fuels and biofuels, catalysts, particulate
filters, and retrofitting buses with catalytic devices or options like water
injection to mitigate pollution and control emissions. While energy so-
briety must remain the primary consideration, technical solutions must
maintain emission levels under the limits necessary for public health and
climate change. IC engines have a potential for high efficiency and near
zero emission levels, particularly when comparing life cycle emissions
with other alternatives in different regions.

8. Conclusions

The local and global emissions from IC engines can be made com-
parable to other powertrains by developing advanced engines powered
by  bio/E-fuels.  Methanol,  DME,  Ethanol,  etc.  can  be  produced  using
atmospheric or industrial CO2. Ammonia and hydrogen can be produced
by renewable, clean, or bio-energy feedstocks. It will eventually reduce
the atmospheric CO2 concentration while lowering the GHG emissions.
This flexibitility to the fuel for the IC engines is the primary advantage of
E-fuel-powered IC engines over fuel-cells and battery powered vehicles.
E-fuel-powered  engines  can  support  the  global  net  zero  vision  while
fuelling the transport sector.

Therefore, R&D must be undertaken to make IC engines more effi-
cient, where E-fuels and bio-fuels should be developed as the primary
energy sources. Initially, E-fuels and biofuels could be used as drop-in
fuel for powering the IC engines and hybrid engines. Challenges asso-
ciated with using low-carbon fuels in the transport sector include fuel
production,  engine  design  modifications,  fuel  blending,  and  pollutant
mitigation.  The  resolution  of  these  challenges  necessitates  a  simulta-
neous  and  comprehensive  approach.  For  this,  academia  and  industry
should collaborate to support R&D. Overall, there is significant promise
in advancing studies toward achieving low carbon and zero emissions.
Comprehensive  attention  to  these  crucial  factors  is  essential  for  suc-
cessful  advancements  in  low-carbon,  zero-emission  technologies.
Widespread deployment of low-emission E-fuels during the next decade
will be crucial to accelerate the decarbonization of the transport sector,
including the aviation and marine sectors, which will likely continue to

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 110 (2025) 101236

depend  more  on  fuel-based  solutions  for  their  decarbonization.  Fuels
obtained from electrolytic hydrogen, or E-fuels, have the potential to be
viable pathways and quick scale-up, underpinned by an unprecedented
expansion of cheaper renewable electricity and expected cost reductions
of  electrolyzers.  E-fuels  can  also  add  to  the  diversification  of  decar-
bonization options, and there exists a significant potential synergy with
biofuel production, especially in the form of biogenic CO2 utilization. To
summarise, hydrogen, methanol, DME, ethanol, ammonia, other E-fuels
and biofuels will be important for decarbonizing transport in the future,
along  with  IC  engines.  To  make  it  happen,  R&D  efforts,  both  basic
fundamental research and product development, should be undertaken
on a large scale. It is important to address the issue of fuels, IC engines,
and transport in earnest and make decisions based on scientific aspects.
Some examples of specific future directions for implementing these so-
lutions can be summarized as follows:

●  Low-carbon fuels are vital for limiting GHG emissions and improving
air  quality.  E-fuel  integration  in  transport  requires  infrastructure
development, user-friendly policies, and industry collaborations.
●  The cost of energy in the future is expected to increase. Transitioning
from  fossil  to  renewable  energy  sources  demands  highly  efficient
powertrains for transport applications. IC engines have the potential
for  low  energy  consumption  and  emissions  when  considering
comprehensive  life  cycle  analysis,  depending  on  electricity  local
production emissions balance.

●  If produced from renewable electricity or biomass, H2 can represent
an  excellent  carbon-free  fuel  for  IC  engines,  even  if  transport  and
storage costs remain challenging.

●  To mitigate NOx emissions triggered by the high temperature of the
hydrogen flame, lean to very lean equivalence ratio can be targeted
at medium and low load conditions.

● Lean-to-very-lean  mixtures  need  to  be  studied  in  terms  of  funda-
mental  combustion properties  in  engine-like conditions  to support
the  development  and  validation  of  both  kinetic  mechanisms  and
computational  models  and,  hence,  the  development  of  the
technology.

●  The  wide  range  of  possible  equivalence  ratios  can  lead  to  very
different flame morphologies, speeds, and turbulent combustion re-
gimes, questioning the validity of existing models. Hence, detailed
fundamental investigations of flame characteristics is required.
●  Ammonia is not only an efficient H2 carrier but an carbon-free E-fuel

to power engines.

●  The low  reactivity  of NH3,  leading  to low  flame speed  or  difficult
ignition, can be counter-balanced by the increase of the compression
ratio, ammonia dissociation, or the use of a pilot diesel-like fuel in CI
engines.

●  Due to the fuel-bound nitrogen, its combustion is responsible for NOx
emissions  along  with  possible  ammonia  slip  (due  to  the  low  reac-
tivity)  that  need  to  be  addressed  to  have  a  trade-off  between  un-
burned NH3  and NOx  emissions as well as catalytic after-treatment
system such as a SCR.

●  The  flash  boiling  mechanisms  for  ammonia  vaporization  with  its
high vaporization heat results in longer and narrower liquid spray
than gasoline and ethanol. This issue needs to be addressed by the
design of efficient ammonia injection systems.

●  The  spray  investigations  indicated  that  optimizing  the  droplet
behaviour of E-fuels may enhance combustion efficiency and reduce
emissions. The optimum fuel blending can lower soot concentration
for cleaner fuel alternatives.

●  Methanol and DME are oxygenated fuels; the inherent oxygen makes

them suitable for transport applications with lower emissions.

●  The technical feasibility of lower methanol-concentrated methanol-
gasoline  blends  is  already  established.  The  current  research  is
focused on M85 or higher blends for SI engines. Electronic sensors
and control have eased the recalibration procedure of fuel injection
systems for adapting M85.

●  In  higher-efficiency  CI  engines,  methanol  is  limited  to  CI  via
methanol-diesel blends. The HPDI technique has evolved as a novel
fuel  injection  technique  for  replacing  diesel,  which  needs  to  be
further developed for large-scale use of methanol in CI engines.
●  DME utilization as a drop-in fuel through retrofitting is a solution for
adapting 100 % DME, especially for agriculture sector applications.
It could also be added efficiently to ammonia to reduce overall car-
bon footprint.

IC engines will continue to serve the transport sector using E-Fuels/
Biofuels despite negative narratives and statements such as “Death of IC
Engines”  and  “IC  Engine  Ban”  and  this  will  remain  a  fantasy in  fore-
seeable future. E-fuels produced from renewable sources would even-
tually support the countries achieving Net Zero. E-fuels/Biofuels would
also  improve  engine  efficiency  using  advanced  combustion  technolo-
gies,  which  would  evolve  with  time.  The  existing  fuel  outlets  and
infrastructure would be adapted to supply E-fuels and Biofuels. Artificial
interlligence,  machine  learning  and  other  emerging  new  technologies
would help the engine manufacturers to improve the combustion effi-
ciency and reduce emissions. The production of E-fuels from renewable
sources  and  their  usage  would  start  the  new  era  of  IC  engines  by
achieving ultra-high efficiency and eventually developing ultra-clean IC
engines.
