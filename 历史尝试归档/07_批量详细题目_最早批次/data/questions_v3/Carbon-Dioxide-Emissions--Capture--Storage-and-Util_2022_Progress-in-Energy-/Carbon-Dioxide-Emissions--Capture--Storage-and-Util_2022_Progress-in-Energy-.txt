Carbon  capture  and  storage  (CCS)  is  an  essential  component  of  mitigating  climate  change,  which  arguably
presents  an  existential  challenge  to  our  planet.  Although  CO2  emissions  have  been  on  the  global  agenda  for
several decades, progress has been extremely slow, insufficient and sporadic.

Anthropogenic CO2  emissions are the direct result of our addiction to fossil fuels, and in 2018 accounted for
68% (or, 37.5 GtCO2) out of the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of 55.3 GtCO2e globally. Capturing CO2 at
such massive quantities would require resources and technologies that can operate cost-effectively at the multi-
gigaton  scale,  which  we  currently  lack.  Moreover,  CO2  capture  is  an  expensive  and  highly  energy  intensive
process  complicated  further  by  logistics  and  the  diversity  of  the  emission  sources  that  vary  by  volume,
composition, location, type, and industry or sector. At the same time, however, such diversity also highlights that
one size does not fit all, and hence, dictates the need for a multi-prong strategy that emphasizes the necessity to
develop wide range of CCS technologies, materials and processes.

This article presents a global overview and impartial assessment of the current state of CCS challenges in an
extensive manner covered under the main headings of pre- and post-combustion CO2 capture, direct air capture,
CO2 transport and storage and utilization, and carbon pricing. Materials aspects of post-combustion CO2 capture
technologies  are  reviewed  in  detail.  The  article  provides  critical  discussions  of  fundamental  phenomena  and
recent  advances  in  the  field,  as  well  as  tutorial-type  background  information,  where  appropriate.  The  article
reviews the status of global CO2  emissions as well as carbon sources and sinks, and examines a broad range of
major technologies, methodologies, processes, and materials for CO2  capture, discusses technology options for
carbon capture from fossil fuel-based power generation, presents the challenges to storage, utilization and the
global pricing of CO2, and finishes with an assessment of knowledge gaps, mitigation options and opportunities
for advances.

The  article  emphasizes  the  fact  that  there  are  no  easy  fixes  or  cheap  technological  solutions  to  the  inter-
connected problems of energy, CO2 emissions and climate change. The threats to Earth’s ecosystems are too real
and imminent to be judged and driven only by economics. In this existential context, the choice between ‘pay
now’ or ‘pay later’ is clear and paying later will be much more expensive. The world must act now.

1. Introduction

It was not an understatement when in December 2018 the Secretary
General  Antonio  Guterres  of  the  United  Nations  (UN)  observed,
“We are in trouble. We are in deep trouble with climate change...” [1] during
the opening of the 24th annual UN Climate Change Conference held in
Poland [2]. In early December 2020, he voiced his warning bell again
and called out “Humanity is waging war on nature. This is suicidal.” [3].
Indeed,  the  Production  Gap  Report  2020  indicates  that  despite  the
impending climate crisis, the world insists on investing in fossil fuels,

and their continued use is expected to increase by 2% annually through
2030, which would double the required amount of reductions to limit
◦
the temperature rise to 1.5

C [4].

The  power  generation  sector  driven  primarily  by  fossil  fuels
accounted for 36% of the CO2 emissions across advanced economies of
the world in 2019, down from 42% in 2012 [6]. Although coal’s share in
primary energy fell to a 15-year low of 27.2%, it still remains a signif-
icant  source  for  the  global  energy  mix.  Coal  consumption  in  the  US,
India and China accounted for, respectively, 8.4%, 12.0% and 50.5% of
the global coal consumption in 2018 [7]. While China was the biggest

contributor to the global CO2  emissions in 2018 at 27.8%, US came in
2nd place with 15.2% [8].

Fossil  fuels  have  collectively  been  the  single  largest  source
of  CO2  emissions,  responsible  for  nearly  65%  of  the  global  green
house gas emissions [9]. As global emissions increased by nearly 1.5%
(or,  450  Mt  CO2)  in  2017,  developing  countries  in  Asia  were  largely
responsible for this increase, which is led primarily by the largest CO2
emitter  China,  followed  by  India.  This  is  illustrated  in  Fig.  1,  which
provides the historical record of CO2  emissions by major emitters be-
tween 1990 and 2018.

Recent  assessment  from  the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate
Change  (IPCC)  recommends  limiting  the  cumulative  quantity  of  CO2
emissions  between  2018  and  the  start  of  achieving  net-zero  global
emissions (i.e., the world’s remaining carbon budget) to 750 GtCO2 for
◦
an even chance of restraining global warming to 1.5
C of temperature
rise, or to 550 GtCO2 for a 2/3rd chance [10]. This would imply reaching
carbon  neutrality  in  35  years  for  the  750  GtCO2  budget  and  nearly
25 years for the 550 GtCO2 budget scenarios both of which imminently
demand urgent action on the part of the global community at an un-
precedented scale.

The 2019 UN Emissions Gap Report [11] and the recent IPCC reports
[12,13] strongly urged a 55% cut in CO2 emissions by 2030 in order to
◦
C.  The  reports  also  urged  rapid
limit  global  warming  to  within  1.5
transformation of the global energy systems from fossil fuels to renew-
ables in order to achieve net-zero emissions by mid-century.

The world consumed 654 EJ of energy in 2018, of which 80% was
supplied  by  fossil  fuels  that  are  also  expected  to  provide  68%  of  the
global  energy  in  2050  [14].  By  comparison,  the  global  community
consumed 80.3 EJ (or, 22,315 TWh) of electricity in 2018. For 100%
renewables, this would require building a renewable electricity gener-
ation capacity of 181,700 TWh, which is more than 8 times the total
installed  generation  capacity  we  now  have.  Transforming  the  global
energy infrastructure into solely renewables will be an unprecedented
undertaking,  especially  when  considering  the  current  generation  ca-
pacity  is  only  5490  TWh  for  all  renewables.  With  the  exception  of
pumped hydro and compressed air energy storage, both of which are
site-specific and available in only certain geographies, other renewable
sources are undispatchable in nature and have inherently variable and
intermittent power outputs, which make it difficult to integrate into the
global electric grid without adequate energy storage capacity [15].

Unfortunately, the global energy storage capacity at the end of 2020
stood  at  merely  800  GWh  [16]  and  95%  of  this  storage  capacity  is
provided by pumped hydro alone, which is largely inaccessible to the
wider global community. By the end of 2019, the world had installed a
total  of  2533  GW  of  renewable  capacity  [17].  To  store  2533  GW  of
renewable power for an average duration of four hours, approximately
10,000 GWh of storage capability would be required. It is clear that 800
GWh of storage capacity falls far too short of meeting the need by any
measure. Consequently, without synchronous build up of commensurate
storage capacity, the rate of growth and penetration of renewable power
sources  into the electric grid to dominate the global energy economy
may run the risk of slowing down.

Besides, expectations that renewables are able to provide 100% of
the global energy needs may also be unrealistic, and even be impractical.
Whether the world’s entire energy needs can truly be supplied by re-
newables only [18,19] is an ongoing debate [20,21] with arguments on
both sides of the issue. It’s not clear how fast the world can quickly shake
off its addiction to fossil fuels, and instead fully embrace renewables as
its only energy source.

Energy and climate cannot be considered independent of each other.
They are intimately linked as CO2 emissions impact climate change. So
solutions to mitigate climate change must be commensurate with and
responsive  to  the  rising  energy  demands  of  the  global  community.
Energy is also intimately linked with environment, food production, and
fresh  water  availability,  all  of  which  also  affect  population  shifts,
growth,  and  mass  migrations.  For  example,  electricity  is  an  essential
component for both the extraction and distribution of water for human
activity  and  needs.  At  the  same  time,  water  is  the  lifeblood  of
thermoelectric  power  production.  Understanding  such  complex
interlinks among these individual elements, i.e., the “grand nexus” [22,
23],  is  essential  for  proper  assessment  of  energy  options,  especially
vis-`a-vis carbon capture. The strong interlinks and dependencies among
the major components of the grand nexus are illustrated in Fig. 2. Water
is  a  critically  scarce  resource  in  many  parts  of  the  world.  It  is  also
indispensible for thermoelectric power generation, which requires close
to  1  m3/kWh  for  natural  gas  combined  cycle  plants,  while  coal  base
combustion plants demand >2 m3/kWh as depicted in Fig. 3. Moreover,
CO2  capture  processes  place  even  greater  demand  for  water  as  high-
lighted in Fig. 3, where the water demand nearly doubles with carbon
capture from various fossil fuel-based electricity production technolo-
gies [24]. Accordingly, any technology advancement in electric power
generation  from  fossil  fuels  that  helps  reduce  the  demand  for  water
presents  huge  environmental  and  economic  benefits.  In  that  regard,
oxygen-based technologies [22] discussed in the present article largely

negates  the  need  for  freshwater  withdrawal,  while  at  the  same  time
producing highly concentrated flue streams of near capture ready CO2.
It is generally agreed that increased use of fossil fuels since the start
of  the  industrial  revolution  in  the  mid  18th  century  has  been  largely
responsible for the dramatic rise in the anthropogenic CO2 concentration
in the atmosphere. Although the percent shares of fossil fuels in global
electricity  generation  have  been  steadily  falling  in  recent  years  due
mainly to the rapid expansion and deployment of renewable sources, the
actual amounts of fossil fuels consumed globally for power generation as
well as for other energy needs have been increasing and this trend is
expected  to  continue  into  the  mid-century,  as  depicted  in  Fig.  4.
Accordingly, energy-related emission of CO2 is also expected to increase
into the foreseeable future, as illustrated in Fig. 5.

Even as the prospect of imminent climate change is looming high,
many countries are electing investments in fossil fuels over renewables
and green energy [4,25]. In fact between 2010 and 2018, whereas U.S.
and  Europe  decommissioned  nearly  140  GW  of  coal-fired  power  ca-
pacity,  India  and  China  respectively  added  91  GW  and  342  GW  of
coal-fired power capacity within the same period [27] for a net gain of
293 GW. In addition, China is actively building more than 140 coal-fired
power  plants  in  countries  along  their  Belt  and  Road  Initiative  tran-
scending  China,  Eurasia,  and  Africa  [28].  Such  heavy  investments  in

coal-fired  power  generation  naturally  raise  further  concerns  for
increased CO2 emissions.

The  increased  use  of  natural  gas  as  the  low  carbon  resource  for
electrical power generation is expected to continue as long as the natural
gas prices remain competitive with coal. The preference for natural gas
is partly due its smaller carbon footprint (~ 470 gCO2/kWh of electricity
produced), which is nearly two times less than CO2 emissions from coal-
fired power plants that generate 700 to 1000 gCO2/kWh. Around the
globe, air-based combustion has been  the backbone of thermoelectric
power  generation  from  fossil  fuels,  but  the  resulting  plant  level  effi-
ciencies have been dismally low. For example, the average efficiencies of
US thermoelectric power generation plants tested and monitored by the
US Department of Energy over a 5-year period are around 33% for coal-
and  natural  gas-fired  plants  [29].  As  air  is  employed  for  fossil  fuel
combustion in these thermoelectric power plants, the stack gasses from
natural gas and coal fired plants contain, respectively, about 3% to 5%
CO2  and 10% to 15% CO2, with the remaining made up largely by ni-
trogen. In the case of natural gas power plants, water vapor is also a
significant constituent in stack gasses. Due to similarities in their mo-
lecular properties, separation and capture of such lean concentrations of
CO2  from  N2  is  difficult  and  requires  expensive  and  energy  intensive
post-separation processes.

and coal consumed for power generation are also expected to increase through mid century [26].

There is, however, an opportunity to significantly reduce the scale of
energy penalty and financial cost of carbon capture by phasing out air-
based  combustion,  while  rapidly  transitioning  into  oxygen-based
advanced  technologies  such  as  high  temperature  fuel  cells  [22,30],
some of which are discussed in the present article. They promise not only
higher efficiencies, but more importantly, possibility to facilitate pro-
duction of highly concentrated CO2 flue streams that would enable easy
and cost effective capture from these point sources. At the same time,
oxygen-based  power  generation  can  buy  time  to  rapidly  develop  and
build up requisite energy storage capacities at the TWh scale to enable
faster rates of penetration of renewables into the electrical grid.

There  is  a  wide  range  of  technology  options  for  carbon  capture,
utilization  and  storage  (CCUS).  Fig.  6  summarizes  many  of  these  ap-
proaches  and  illustrates  the  possible  pathways  as  well  as  interlinks.
Significant advances in both scientific understanding and technological
development of various options for CO2 capture, storage, and utilization
have been achieved. Many of these topical areas, but not all, are pre-
sented and discussed in this article. At the same time, the breadth and

diversity  of  these  options  necessarily  limit  the  scope  of  the  present
article to review select systems, materials and technologies that offer the
potential  for  practical  use.  It  provides  a  structured  overview  without
advocating or recommending any one particular technology option over
others, as this author believes in the need for a multi-prong approach to
address and mitigate CO2 emissions, as one size technology does not fit
all.  Accordingly,  this  review  presents  relevant  fundamental  concepts,
advances in materials and processes for carbon capture, discusses ad-
vantages and shortcomings, and highlights potential risks of individual
technological  options,  while  providing  insights  for  active  researchers
and  decision  makers.  Also,  tutorial  materials  for  the  uninitiated  are
presented, where appropriate.

Besides the 2015 National Academy of Sciences report [32], there
have been excellent reviews on various aspects of CCS provided in the
literature. A recent article provides an excellent and extensive review of
carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) technologies and their
techno-economics with focus on commercialization and integration of
CCS  into  the  electricity  system  for  decarbonization  [33],  while  the

pathways to achieve net-zero emission energy systems across a broad
range of energy services and industrial sectors were presented and dis-
cussed in a recent article [34]. Another review considered a combination
of  two  or  more  different  CCS  technologies  and  suggests  that  hybrid
processes  offer advantages in  energy penalty and CO2  recovery when
compared  to  stand  alone  systems  [35].  Capture  and  reuse  of  CO2  for
supercritical cycles was reviewed with an eye for power generation and
industrial  applications  [36].  These  and  others  [37–40]  are  valuable
contributions to our knowledge base in appreciating the complexity and
enormity of the challenge. While complementing the recent reviews, the
present article provides a broad overview of processes and materials for
CO2  capture  from  electrical  power  generation  operations,  and  distin-
guishes  itself  from  most  of  the  previous  reviews  by  the  breadth  and
variety of technological and materials options it covers.

The  present  article  also  promotes  that  placing  equal  emphasis  on
capturing the ‘output’ CO2 emissions deserves as much attention as fully
decarbonizing the ‘input’ sources for energy and electricity production.
This  author  believes  this  strategy  can  contribute  greatly  to  a  smooth
transition into renewables by allowing time for storage technologies as
well as capacities to catch up with the pace of penetration of renewables
into the electric grid. In that regard, the article discusses oxygen-based
combustion and conversion technologies, and introduces high temper-
ature fuel cells both for carbon abatement and capture, as well as for
electrochemical separation of CO2 from lean flue streams. Furthermore,
it presents the status of global CO2  emissions and updated statistics to
emphasize the scale and magnitude of the challenge, identifies many of
the  knowledge  and  technological  gaps,  and  provides  insights  for  op-
portunities to achieve clean electricity.

It  should  be  noted,  however,  that  capturing  CO2  from  industrial
processes such as cement and steel production [41] and from distributed
sources  such  as
transportation,  as  well  as  engineering  and
techno-economic analyses of different technology options all lie outside
the  scope  of  this  overview  article,  although  relevant  information  and
published cost figures, where available and appropriate, are provided
for completeness.

2. CO2  emissions, sources and sinks

2.1. Radiative impact of atmospheric CO2

CO2  is  an  oxidation  product  of  carbonaceous  fuels  and  chemicals,
and constitutes nearly ~3/4th of the global greenhouse gasses (GHG)
emissions [42], as shown in Fig. 7. Fossil fuel combustion makes up a
large portion of the global CO2 emissions. The atmospheric lifetimes of

GHGs  including  CO2  and  their  ability  to  absorb  energy  i.e.,  radiative
efficiency, differ widely by several orders of magnitude, as depicted in
Table  1.  Individual  contributions  of  CO2  and  other  GHG  gasses  on
climate are generally expressed in terms of their “global warming po-
tential” (GWP). This is a measure of the amount of energy absorbed by 1
ton of CO2 over a given period of time, usually considered over a span of
100 years, although some databases also use 20 years. By definition, CO2
has a GWP = 1 regardless of the time period. The lifetime of CO2 in the
atmosphere  is  difficult  to  ascertain  accurately,  as  portion  of  the  CO2
emissions is captured by terrestrial as well as biological sinks.

Although  not  the  most  potent  greenhouse  gas  for  its  GWP,  CO2
constitutes the largest volume GHG that greatly impacts global climate
change by absorbing outgoing infra-red radiation from the earth surface
and re-emitting part of it back to Earth. In other words, it serves as a
thermal shield placed around the planet. Indeed, CO2 is responsible for
65% (or, 1.7 W/m2) of the total global downward radiative forcing of
2.6 W/m2  for  all  greenhouse  gasses  collectively  [45].  Hence,  carbon
capture and storage (CCS) is central to curb the amount of CO2 released
into the atmosphere and mitigate climate change [46].

Once released, however, CO2 stays in the atmosphere for a long time.
The lifetimes, radiative efficiencies and relative GWP values of a select
group  of  greenhouse  gasses  [43,44]  are  summarized  in  Table  1.  The
20-year,  100-year,  and  500-year  GWP  columns,  represent  energy
absorbed over 20, 100 or 500 years. For those gasses such as CH4  that
have  a  shorter  lifetime  in  the  atmosphere  compared  to  CO2,  their
20-year  GWP  values  are  generally  magnified,  while  for  many  of  the
chlorofluorocarbons,  hydrofluorocarbons,  hydro-
fluorocarbons,
chlorofluorocarbons,  perfluorocarbons,  and  sulfur  hexafluoride  that
have longer lifetimes than CO2, their 20-year GWP values are signifi-
cantly reduced [47]. The complex interplay between CO2 and the other
greenhouse  gasses  in  the  atmosphere  with  their  respective  radiative
forces and processes collectively result in the greenhouse effect.

Interestingly,  water  vapor  in  the  atmosphere  accounts  for  nearly
60% of the greenhouse effect [43,44] and facilitates the largest positive
feedback loop, i.e., increased temperatures also increase the amount of
water  vapor  that  the  atmosphere  can  hold.  Unlike  other  greenhouse
gasses including CO2, however, human activity has very little impact on
the amount of water vapor uptake by the atmosphere. Also, both water
vapor and ozone had short lifetimes on the order of days and weeks in
the atmosphere. Curiously, the impact of CO2 (and water vapor) on the
radiative effect of sunrays was first recognized and reported as early as
in  1856  [48].  There  is  now  general  agreement  among  the  scientific
community that anthropogenic CO2 emissions indeed play a major role
in climate change [49–51].

anthropogenic CO2 emissions resulting from human activities, and those
from natural sources and causes such as wild fires. Human activity is
◦
C warming of our
considered to be responsible for approximately 1.0
planet above the pre-industrial period, and limiting global temperature
◦
rise to 1.5
C will require achieving net zero carbon by 2050 as well as
removing  100  to  1000  Gt  of  CO2  from  the  atmosphere  over  the  21st
century [13]. Achieving such unprecedented scale of CO2  removal is a
daunting,  if not  a  formidable task.  Emissions  from  natural causes are
obviously  more  difficult  to  control  and  manage,  but  man-made  emis-
sions  offer  opportunities  for  capture.  In  that  regard,  emissions  from
stationary point sources are the preferred targets for carbon capture than
those from distributed sources such as transportation. Regardless of the
type  of  CO2  emissions  sources,  most  man-made  emissions  employ
air-based combustion of fossil fuels in their process chains. The resulting
product  streams  released  to  the  atmosphere  necessarily  contain
considerable amounts of nitrogen, and also show variability in their CO2
concentrations.  This  is  summarized  in  Table  2,  which  presents  the
average concentrations and partial pressures of CO2 in the flues streams
of various industrial production and power generation plants. Typically,
the partial pressures of CO2 in flue streams of power generation plants
are  significantly  smaller  than  for  industrial  production  plants,  which
render  CO2  separation  comparatively  more  difficult  and  costly  from
power generation than from industrial flue streams [52].

Nearly 70% of global CO2  emissions is due to fossil fuels used pri-
marily  for  power  generation,  transportation,  and  various  industrial
processes including cement and steel production. The energy sector has
been the largest contributor responsible for nearly 1/3rd of the global
anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This is shown in Fig. 8,
where both distributed (e.g., transportation) and stationary point source
(e.g., electricity generation, industry) activities contribute significantly
to  total  emissions.  Such  diversity  of  emission  sources  and  technology
types necessarily demand different approaches to properly address CO2
capture and storage.

Capturing  CO2  from  distributed  sources  such  as  transportation,
which account for nearly 1/6th of the global emissions, obviously poses
greater difficulties than capturing from massive point sources. A diesel
engine vehicle emits nearly 2700 kgCO2/m3 of diesel, while a gasoline
engine  vehicle  emits  nearly  15%  less,  or  2300  kgCO2/m3  of  gasoline
[53].  In  other  words,  a  typical  passenger  vehicle  driven  18,200 km
annually  with  an  average  fuel  efficiency  of  9  kilometers  per  liter  of
gasoline emits 4.7 tCO2/year. With more than 281 million vehicles on
the  road  in  2020  in  the  US  and  nearly  1.4  billion  in  the  world,  the
resulting  annual  emissions  are  nearly  1.3  GtCO2  and  6.6  GtCO2,
respectively. The latter makes up close to 20% of the global CO2 emis-
sions. Capturing such large quantities of CO2 in gigatons from such small
and distributed emitters pose significant technical and logistical chal-
lenges  far  above  and  beyond  those  posed  by  capturing  it  from  point
sources.  Naturally,  rapid  electrification  of  the  transportation  sector
greatly helps reduce these emissions. Increased global demand in energy
heavily  dominated  by  fossil  fuels  (see  Fig.  4)  has  resulted  in

commensurate growth in CO2 emissions. Earlier reports from the Global
Carbon Project [54] and others [55,56] indicated that the global CO2
emissions have shown a stark increase in 2017 and 2018 after remaining
largely  flat  during  the  2014–2016  period  as  shown  in  Fig.  9,  which
differentiates  the  relative  contributions  of  advanced  economies
compared to the rest of the world during the period 1990–2019. In this
context, advanced economies are represented by the European Union in
addition to 13 other countries. Fig. 9 also indicates that while energy
related CO2 emissions fell by 3.2% in 2019 in advanced economies, Asia
dominated by China and India, was responsible for nearly 80% of the
emissions growth in the rest of the world (see Fig. 1 above).

Interestingly  during  the  COVID-19  lockdowns  in  2020,  the  pre-
liminary data had predicted that the world’s CO2 emissions would drop
by ~7% relative to 2019 emissions [57]. Indeed during 2020, world’s
energy  demand  dropped  4%  and  resulted  in  ~2  GtCO2  (or,  5.8%)
reduction  in  global  CO2  emissions  to  31.5  GtCO2,  but  the  downward
trend is expected to rapidly reverse itself to rebound by 4.8% increase in
CO2 emissions by the end of 2021 [58]. Hence, the impact of the 2020
pandemic on CO2 emissions has been rather limited [59].

Despite public pressure for environmental and climate change con-
cerns, the world’s addiction to fossil fuels is not easy to shake off. The
Production Gap Report 2020 by the UN Environment Programme [60]
highlights the large gap between planned fossil fuel production levels for
countries and the global levels necessary to curb the temperature rise,
and indicates that the projected growth trajectory points to increased
production in global fossil fuels by 2030 that will be more than 120% of
◦
what would have been required to limit the temperature rise to 1.5
C.
Indeed, the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, which was around 280
′
ppmv during the start of the industrial revolution in 1750
s, has been
steadily rising at an alarming rate since then. Indeed, monthly average
measurements at Mauna Loa station in Hawaii indicated that the CO2
level in the atmosphere has now reached 419.05 ppmv in April 2021,
which represents a 2.6 ppmv increase from 416.45 ppmv measured in
April 2020 [61]. This is depicted in Fig. 10. What is more disturbing is
the fact that the annual mean growth rate in atmospheric CO2 concen-
′
tration has been steadily increasing from 0.9 ppmv/yr in the 1960
s to
′
1.5 ppmv/yr in the 1990
s [62]. The 5th
Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC-AR5)  had  concluded  that  rapid  decarbonization  and  trans-
formation of the electricity generation sector into low-GHG alternatives
is  required  to  stabilize  the  atmospheric  levels  at  the  430  to  530 ppm
CO2e  (i.e., CO2  equivalent) levels by 2100 [63]. Note that CO2e  repre-
sents the same amount of time-integrated radiative forcing over a given
period of time by greenhouse gasses compared to CO2 emissions. Earlier,

the  2007  IPCC  report  had  recommended  that atmospheric  CO2  levels
should be stabilized around 450 ppmv by mid-century in order to avoid
series risks for the health and well-being of our planet’s ecosystems [43,
44].  By  either  count,  the  atmospheric  CO2  concentration  is  fast
approaching  the  critical  zone  identified  by  these  IPCC  reports  not  to
transcend in order to stabilize climate change.

The recent United Nations Emissions Gap Report of 2019 [5] sent a

similar warning and cautioned the world is on course for a 3.2

perature rise with nearly 55.3 GtCO2e  of emissions in 2018, of which
37.5 GtCO2 was from fossil fuel emissions. The 2019 report also sends a
dire  warning  to  the  global  community  to  take  immediate  action  in
dramatically reducing total emissions by 25% and 55% lower (or, 15

by 5-fold and commit to cutting their emissions by 7.6% every single
year between 2020 and 2030 in order to achieve the 25 GtCO2e  emis-
sions limit. Needless to say, this imminent and urgent threat is yet to be

lacking.

Left  unchecked,  CO2  emissions  pose  unprecedented  risks  for  the
delicate ecosphere of our fragile planet. Consequential impacts of the
rapid build-up of atmospheric CO2 are generally associated with acidi-
fication of the oceans, warming of the planet, disruption of ecosystems,
and climate change, including extremes of weather events and climatic
conditions such as extended droughts, severe storms and floods, rapid
melting of continental ice [65,66], and sea level rise, all of which may
alter  or  harm  the  earth’s  ecosystems  in  possibly  irreversible  ways.
Worse,  we  may  be  fast  approaching  a  dangerous  threshold  where
reversing the emissions trend simply by capturing CO2  from point and
distributed  emission  sources  may  not  be  sufficient  to  eliminate  the
possibility  of  irreversible  change  [67].  Unless  drastic  measures  were
implemented urgently to reverse the rising trend in CO2  emissions, ef-
forts  to  adapt  to  new  environmental  and  climatic  constraints  are  ex-
pected to face difficult choices and serious challenges.

If nations do not act but wait until 2025 to take action, more drastic
measures  including  15.5%  reduction  in  emissions  per  year  will  be
required.  Such  inaction  will  greatly  jeopardize  if  not  make  it  very

exceed  41  GtCO2e  by  2030,  while  1.8
C  will  require
larger  reductions  keeping  total  emissions  below  34  GtCO2e,  and  25
GtCO2e, respectively. The report also estimates that policies commen-
◦
surate with achieving 1.5
C rise will demand a significant annual in-
vestment between $1.8 trillion and $3.8 trillion per year by the global
community over the 2020–2050 period to upscale their energy systems.
Unfortunately, the pace and the scale of measures taken by the global
community  have not been sufficient  to meet these targets [68]. 2020
Cancun pledges by the G20 countries to collectively reduce their emis-
sion  by  1  GtCO2e  per  year  is  severely  lagging  behind  with  many
including the U.S.A., Canada and the Republic of Korea missing their
targets. In a similar manner, nationally determined contribution (NDC)
targets  for  emission  reductions  from  major  economies  have  largely
lagged  behind  as  indicated  in  Fig.  11,  which  compares  the  relative
progress  of  various  countries  towards  meeting  their  reduction
commitments.

Developing  not  only  technologies,  but also  policies  to  reduce  CO2
emissions are complicated further by indirect factors and externalities.
Emissions in one geographical location do not stay in that region but
spread across the globe. Moreover, emissions are also intimately incor-
porated into the vast scale of international trade. As CO2 production in
one country or location provide the goods and services, as well as in-
dustrial or consumer products in another country, this supply chain has
a significant impact in accurate accounting for regional CO2  emissions
[69,70].

It  is  clear  that  rapid  mobilization  of  a  concerted  global  effort  is
required  to  achieve  the  objectives  outlined  in  the  2018  IPCC-SR15
preliminary  report  [10]  as  well  as  in  the  2015  Paris  Agreement.  The
recent  meeting  of  the  Group  of  Seven (G7)  countries on  June  11–13,
2021 in Cornwall, UK, provided a glimmer of hope for the globe in this
regard, where the G7 leaders made commitments to cut their collective
emissions by 50% by 2030 and achieve net-zero emissions before 2050
◦
in order to limit the rise in temperature to 1.5
C [71]. To achieve these
goals at the global scale, multi-throng strategies must be implemented
and  deployed  rapidly  in  order  to  reduce  atmospheric  carbon  levels.
These will most likely involve several key ingredients including carbon
capture and storage, increased energy efficiency, rapid transformation
of energy supply from fossil fuels to renewables, rapid transitioning of
fossil  fuel-based  thermoelectricity  production  from  air-based  to

oxygen-based advanced power generation technologies [22], as well as
better management of terrestrial sources and sinks for CO2 [72,73].

2.3. Global CO2  sources and sinks

There are both man-made (i.e., anthropogenic) and natural sources
for  CO2  emissions,  and  human  activity  contributes  heavily  into  that
outcome.  Any  strategy  to  tackle  the  emissions  challenge  should  also
involve more effective and efficient management of terrestrial sources
and sinks for CO2. Less than half of the total CO2 emissions remain in the
atmosphere, while the rest is taken up and removed by oceans and the
terrestrial biosphere. Besides technological routes to capture CO2, nat-
ural and biological pathways for carbon fixation and storage including
forestation and photosynthesis, ocean fertilization and hydration (i.e.,
hydrate formation), and mineral carbonization should also be exploited.
However, discussion of these subtopical areas falls out of the scope of
this article, and is not covered here.

During the period 2000–2018, CO2  emissions into the atmosphere
from the burning of fossil fuels rose by 24.5 Gt of CO2 (or, 6.7 Gt of C).
Indeed, the 2019 United Nations Emissions Gap Report [74] indicated
that energy related CO2 emissions primarily due to fossil fuels use have
reached 37.5 Gt of CO2 (or, 10.2 Gt of C) by the end of 2018, and made
up more than 2/3rd of the total global GHG emissions of 55.3 GtCO2e.
Wildfires  constitute  another  major  source  for  CO2  emissions,  and
contributed an additional 7.3 to 9.5 Gt of CO2 (or, 2.0 to 2.6 Gt of C) into
the atmosphere [75].

As  depicted  in  Fig.  12,  there  are  natural  sinks  that  offset  the  CO2
emissions  from  sources.  As  CO2  has  appreciable  solubility  in  water,
oceans help capture significant amounts of CO2 by absorption, ranging
between 5.1 and 15.0 Gt of CO2 annually (or, 1.4 to 4.1 PgC/yr) [75].
Increased emissions force higher concentrations of dissolved CO2 in the
oceans to maintain equilibrium with the increasing concentrations in the
atmosphere.  Higher  concentrations  of  dissolved  CO2  decrease  the  pH
and alter the biological ecosystem of the oceans. A notable impact of
lower ocean pH is the destruction of the corrals, whose livelihood de-
pends heavily on the carbon balance.

Land is another major sink where CO2 is carbonized or mineralized to
carbonates, and adsorbed by soil. Also, the earth’s biosphere removes
significant quantities of CO2  from the atmosphere via photosynthesis.

Fig. 11. Required greenhouse gas reductions for the G20 countries for their nationally determined contributions (NDC) indicate that most countries lag behind and
urgently need to implement additional cuts in emissions by 2030 to achieve their NDC targets under unconditional (left) and conditional (right) scenarios [11].

3. Capture and removal of CO2

CO2  capture  presents  multitude  of  challenges,  as  there  are  widely
differing emission sources with different characteristics, compositions,
volumes, spatial and temporal distributions, as well as different tech-
nology options and materials for CO2 separation from flue streams [37,
40,77–80].Since the industrial revolution, it is estimated that more than
2040±310 GtCO2  has cumulatively been added to the atmosphere be-
tween the years 1750 and 2011 [81]. To accomplish emission reductions
at the gigaton scale requires commensurate industrial capacity, which
we do not have yet. The case in point is the fact that, by one estimate by
the  American  Physical  Society  [45],  it  is  necessary  to  capture  and
remove nearly 7.8 GtCO2  from the atmosphere in order to reduce at-
mospheric concentration of CO2 by only 1 ppmv. On the other hand, the
2015 National Research Council report indicates that 1 ppmv reduction
of  CO2  concentration  in  the  atmosphere  requires  removal  of  18
GtCO2/yr [32]. The disagreement in the required removal amounts may
in  part  be  due  to  differences  in  the  assessment  methodologies  and
related  assumptions  used  for  the  CO2  uptake  and  release  fluxes  from
different sources and sinks.

The average annual upward growth of atmospheric CO2  concentra-
tions in the last 60 years is shown in Fig. 14, where a net increase from
an average of 2.0 to 2.5 ppmv in last decade is related to CO2 emissions
of 35.1 and 37.5 GtCO2 [83]. Although the remnant CO2 concentration
in  the  atmosphere  is  a  result  of  complex  and  dynamic  processes  and
exchanges  among  multitudes  of  CO2  sources  and  sinks,  a  simplistic
approximation suggests that bringing down the atmospheric CO2  con-
centration even 1 ppmv will likely require annual removal of multiple
gigatons of CO2 from air. This presents an immense industrial challenge.
As  an  equivalency  benchmark  to  emphasize  the  magnitude  of  the
problem,  offsetting, i.e., avoiding, the release of 1 GtCO2  into the at-
mosphere would correspond to installing 750 GW of solar PV, 270,000
of 1 MW wind turbines, 136 of 1 GW nuclear power, 273 of 500 MW
zero-emission coal-fire plants, 1000 of Norway’s Sleipner offshore CO2
storage sites, and reforestation of 900,000 km2 of barren area almost the
combined sizes of Germany and France [84]. Aside from the technical
and economic difficulties of CO2 capture, the scale of the magnitude of
this challenge presents an unprecedented industrial built-up and finan-
cial undertaking. Needless to say, reducing the atmospheric concentra-
tions from today’s 419 ppmv to the pre-industrial level of ~280 ppmv
(or, by 134 ppmv) by active removal of CO2 from the atmosphere is an
impossibly formidable task.

The CO2  emissions at the tens of gigatons scale underline the stark
reality that any technology for carbon capture and storage (CCS) has to
be  deployed  at  comparable  scale  in  order  to  make  a  dent  in  the  net
emissions  released  to  the  atmosphere  [72,73].  The  magnitude  of  the
challenge to build the industrial capacity that can handle the volumes
necessary for capturing CO2 is daunting and is often overlooked. Table 3
compares the scales of magnitude of 2018 energy related CO2 emissions
from fossil fuel sources with the world’s total existing production ca-
pacities  of  the  largest  volume  chemicals  and  plastics,  and  provides  a
sobering snap shot of the severity of the challenge the world faces. The
wide chasm between our largest industrial capacities currently in place
and  what  would  be  needed  for  capturing  the  vast  volumes  of  CO2
emissions in the multi-gigaton scale clearly highlights the enormity of
the  problem.  Similarly,  the  total  global  volume  of  petrochemicals  in
2021 is expected around 310 Mt, not significantly different from com-
mon chemicals in Table 3. Outside the chemical industry, global pro-
duction capacities of only liquid fuels from petroleum (~6 Gt in 2019),
cement  (4.1  Gt  in  2018)  and  steel  (1.8  Gt  in  2018)  industries  are
commensurate  with  the  multi-gigaton  capacities  needed  for  CO2
capture.

Given also the widely varying nature and sources for CO2 emissions,
complementary  multi-prong  strategies  are  required  to  achieve  net
removal of CO2 from the atmosphere at the gigaton scale. In this regard,
it was recently suggested that a systems approach, including effective

Fig. 12. The annual global CO2 budgets between January 2000 and December
2018,  depicting  natural  and  man-made  sources  and  sinks  for  carbon.  During
this period, CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion rose from 6.7 PgC/yr to
10.2  PgC/yr  (1  Pg  of  C = 1  GtC = 3.67  PgCO2).  Four  types  of  surface-to-
atmosphere exchange processes are color coded in the figure for easy identifi-
cation. Tan indicates fossil fuel emissions, green represents terrestrial biosphere
flux excluding fires, red denotes direct emissions from fires, and blue indicates
gas  exchange  between  air  and  sea.  Negative  emissions  denote  CO2  removal
from  the  atmosphere, while  the  thick  black  lines  indicate  the  net  surface  ex-
change computed from the sum of the four fluxes [75].

Hence, better management of biomass and land use such as reforestation
and  afforestation,  crop  selection  and  productivity  are  important  con-
siderations [76]. Although there are wide variations in the spatial and
temporal  distribution  of  land  sinks,  terrestrial  biosphere  also  helps
remove 9.1 to 17.6 Gt of CO2  (or, 2.5–4.8 Gt C) annually from the at-
mosphere.  Collectively,  these  natural  terrestrial  sinks  remove  nearly
50%  of  the  anthropogenic  CO2  from  the  atmosphere  [75].  A  more
detailed  budget  for  the  carbon  cycle  of  man-made  and  natural  CO2
sources  as  well  as  sinks  is  presented  in  Fig.  13,  which  indicates  an
average  accumulation  of  4  GtC/yr  (or,  14.67  GtCO2/yr)  in  the  atmo-
sphere. It should be noted that another recent study on the global carbon
budget  indicates  that  the  annual  average  accumulation  of  CO2  in  the
atmosphere has been 5.1 GtC/yr (or, 18.70 GtCO2/yr) during 2010 and
2019  with  a  small  uncertainty  of  only  ±0.02  GtC/yr  [57].  The
discrepancy between the two carbon budget studies highlights the dif-
ficulty and complexity of accurate accounting for emissions.

Interestingly, gross CO2 emissions from natural processes occurring
on lands and oceans are nearly 20 times the volume of anthropogenic
CO2  emissions from fossil fuels and other human activities [32]. This
requires  that  the  efforts  for  better  management  of  lands  and  oceans
should go hand-in-hand with efforts to curb anthropogenic CO2  emis-
sions.  As  expected,  the  individual  contributions  and  roles  of  natural
terrestrial  processes  and  man-made  emissions  in  the  carbon  cycle
display  wide  variations  in  both  their  geographic  and  temporal  distri-
butions. Nevertheless, Fig. 13 illustrates the complex and intricate dy-
namic balances and fluxes among the global carbon sources and sinks.
There is concern, however, that this dynamic equilibrium may not be
robust  enough  to  tolerate  sudden  and  massive  disruptions  or  in-
terventions to the carbon cycle. Indeed, a recent report by the National
Research  Council  (NRC)  cautiously  points  to  the  possible  unintended
consequences of massive carbon capture, where significant quantities of
CO2  removal from the atmosphere may  for example lead to CO2  out-
gassing from the oceans [32].

management  of  CO2  exchange  among  the  atmosphere  and  lands  and
oceans, exploiting the natural biological carbon cycle including refor-
estation and crops, large scale carbon capture and storage (CCS), and
reutilization  of  CO2  and  conversion  into  useful  chemicals  and  fuel
products may collectively help ease the burden on requisite industrial
capacities for CO2 capture [31,73]. To respond to a global challenge of

this magnitude and diversity, a concerted effort to develop a range of
advanced  technologies  is  required  both  to  capture  CO2  as  well  as  to
avoid its production. The latter can be achieved by improved efficiencies
in the use and oxygen-based conversion of fossil fuels for energy and
electricity  production  [22].  Additional  pathways  must  include  devel-
oping  advanced  technologies  for  net-zero  emissions,  carbon-neutral
fuels and energy sources, and rapid transformation of the energy sup-
ply from fossil fuels to predominantly renewable energy sources.

At  the  same  time,  development  of  large  scale  carbon  capture  and

storage  (CCS)  options  and  technologies  have  been  struggling  to  gain
public acceptance and investments towards mitigating climate change.
This is partly due to divergence of public opinions regarding the feasi-
bility,  cost,  reliability,  and  long-term  risks  of  CCS.  Current  lack  of
accepted  and  widely  implemented  mitigation  policies  and  a  global
pricing structure for carbon emissions further complicate the picture and
in fact, partially and covertly subsidize the low cost of fossil fuel-derived
energy with potentially drastic consequences for the planet.

On the financial side, the World Energy Outlook 2016 report [86]
◦
suggested that limiting global temperature rise to within 2
C above the
pre-industrial  period  with  50%  chance  of  success  would  require  in-
vestment of at least $44 trillion. About 60% of the $44 trillion was ex-
pected to go to extraction, production and supply of fossil fuels, as well
as the use of oil, gas, and coal for power production, while only 20% for
renewable energy sources. An additional $23 trillion would be needed
for efficiency improvements in energy systems, services and products.
Even  with  such  an  enormous  investment,  the  report  expected  that
hundreds of millions of people around the world would still not have
access to basic energy services for their needs.

In  all  its  forms,  carbon  capture  and  storage  (CCS)  is  a  costly  and
energy intensive process. As expected, a 2010 U.S. Department of En-
ergy  (DOE)  report  from  the  National  Energy  Technology  Laboratory
(NETL)  has  concluded  that  CCS  adversely  impacts  the  overall  system
efficiency, plant capital cost and levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of
much of the fossil fuel-based advanced thermoelectric power production
in a substantial way [87]. Key findings of this study are presented in
Fig. 15, which indicates significant increases on both the plant capital
cost and the levelized cost of electricity, while substantially decreasing

plant  efficiency  when  CCS  is  implemented.  Similar  findings  were  re-
ported by another DOE  study, which  compared plant efficiencies and
cost  of  electricity  for  various  advanced  coal  and  natural  gas-based
thermoelectric power generation with CCS [88].

Primarily, CCS consists of three major steps, namely, CO2  capture,
transport  (in  a  compressed  state),  and  long-term  storage.  Among  the
three, capturing of CO2 is by far the most costly step in the overall value
chain, and depending on the emission source and other factors, it may
account for 50% to 90% of the overall cost of CCS [89]. This assessment
is supported by other studies that estimated the cost of the CO2 capture
step might exceed 70% to 80% of the total cost of CCS [90,91]. One of
the most advanced technology options for industrial scale CO2 capture
involves chemical separation using liquid amine-based solutions. This
also  serves  as  a  benchmark  for  comparing  other  technology  options.
However, the amine-based process is costly and energy intensive. It also
has other disadvantages including the chemical stability and environ-
mental impact of the amine solution during thermal cycling as well as
the corrosion of the vessel over long use.

Another important consideration in CO2 capture is the concentration
(or partial pressure) of CO2 in the flue stream. As expected, the cost and
energy penalty for capture increases with decreasing CO2 concentration
in the product stream (see Fig. 18 below). Additionally, the temperature
and  chemical  make  up  of  other  constituents  in  the  flue  stream  also
impact  the  suitability  and  efficacy  of  the  capture  technology.  These
considerations  may  be  particularly  important  for  capturing  CO2  from
massive point source flue streams such as fossil fuel-based power plants,
cement production, and iron and steel plants, where the product gasses
typically exit the process stream at significantly elevated temperatures,

as pumps, turbines and membranes. The figure clearly demonstrates the substantial advantage of incorporating fuel cells in power generation and their beneficial
impact on both cost and performance [87]. Filled squares – IGCC; Open squares – IGFC; Blue symbols – with CCS; Red symbols – without CCS.

which  would  require  cooling.  Capturing  especially  from  flue  streams
with  low  CO2  concentrations  presents  major  technical  challenges  to
achieve high yield at high efficiency. Furthermore, the capital costs and
energy penalties for CO2 capture show wide variations depending on the
type of power plant and fuel, geography, volume and the CO2 content of
the flue stream, and the type of capture technology adopted. The cost
estimates are also impacted by the end use. For example, it was  esti-
mated that the total cost of CCS from power plants ranges from $4.5/
tCO2 for coal-based integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) plant
with the end use of CO2 intended for enhanced oil recovery, to $72.4/
tCO2  for a natural gas combined cycle plant with long-term storage of
CO2  in  saline  formations  [92].  Similar  results  are  reported  for  other
industrial processes including iron and steel, cement, refinery, and pulp
and  paper,  where  the  costs  of  CCS  are  estimated  to  vary  between
$30/tCO2 and $70/tCO2 depending on the type of emission source and
CO2 concentration [41,93].

Needless to say, CO2 capture offers significant environmental bene-
fits  and  helps  reduce  its  global  warming  impact.  A  recent  life  cycle
analysis reported that the GWP for a pulverized coal (PC) power plant
without CCS is 876 kgCO2e/MWh while it is 203 kgCO2e/MWh for post-
combustion capture using amine solution, and only 154 kgCO2e/MWh
for  oxy-combustion  [94].  Similarly,  this  study  estimated  the  GWP  of
IGCC  plant  without  CCS  to  be  1009  kgCO2e/MWh,  while  it  is  190
kgCO2e/MWh with pre-combustion CO2 capture. It also concluded that
the GWP of power plants could be reduced significantly with CCS by
nearly 63–82%, where the biggest environmental benefit is offered by
implantation of oxy-combustion in PC and IGCC power generation.

There are more than 300 CO2 capture and storage projects at various
stages in more than 30 countries across the globe. The U.S. Department
of  Energy’s  (DOE)  National  Energy  Technology  Laboratory  (NETL)
maintains an interactive database that keeps track of these projects [95].
Among  these,  the  database  indicates  93  active,  77  completed,  36  on
hold, and 58 terminated projects. Other institutions offer similar data-
bases for the status of CCS projects as well [96–98]. Unfortunately, a
large  fraction  of  these  projects  have  annual  capacities  of  less  than  1
MtCO2, which fall far short of making a dent on the multi-gigaton scale
of CO2 emissions (see Table 3). The Global CCS Institute also keeps track
of  some  of  the  large-scale  CO2  capture  projects  including  oxy-fuel
combustion,  pre-combustion  and  post-combustion  capture  [99],  and
its  October  2019  announcement  included  51  CCS  facilities  across  the
globe,  with  19  in  operation,  4  under  construction,  and  28  in  various
stages  of  development,  for  a  combined  capture  capacity  of  only  96
MtCO2  annually [100]. Clearly, these are insufficiently low capacities
and the world urgently needs much more ambitious initiatives, policies,
and  projects  in  the  gigaton  scale  in  order  to  curb  the  rise  in  CO2
emissions.

3.1. Strategic choices and technology options

Nearly half of the anthropogenic CO2 emissions are from distributed
sources including transportation and residential and commercial heat-
ing, while the remaining is largely from massive point sources such as
power plants, cement and steel manufacturing, refineries, combustion
and  fermentation  processes.  Such  diversity  and  sheer  volume  of  CO2
emissions necessarily require investments in a wide range of technolo-
gies  to  properly  address  CO2  capture  from  these  divergent  sources.
Clearly, one size does not fit all. Accordingly, multi-prong strategies are
needed  to  achieve  dramatic  reduction  in  atmospheric  CO2,  and  these
should  involve  several  key  pathways  including  development  of
advanced technologies for negative as well as net-zero emissions, cap-
ture  and  storage  of  CO2,  improving  energy  efficiency,  developing
carbon-neutral fuels and energy sources, and rapidly transforming the
energy  supply  from  fossil  fuels  to  renewable  sources  with  access  to
adequate  storage  capacities  [101].  The  strategy  should  also  include
exploiting  the  biological  carbon  cycle  and  effective  management  of
terrestrial CO2 sources and sinks including lands and oceans [73].

There  are  several  technology  options  for  CO2  capture  from  point
sources as well as directly from air, as depicted in Fig. 16. Needless to
say, climate change mitigation measures must also involve CO2 capture
from other point sources including industrial processes such as cement
and  steel  manufacturing,  petrochemical  plants,  as  well  as  distributed
sources  such  as  transportation  in  all  of  its  forms.  Generally  accepted
carbon  capture  categories  are,  namely,  pre-combustion,  post-combus-
tion,  oxyfuel  combustion,  and  direct  air  capture.  The  latter  is  self
explanatory, as it involves capturing CO2 directly from air regardless of
the location of CO2  emissions, while oxyfuel combustion involves the
use of oxygen –  instead of air –  for burning the fossil fuel and hence,
yields a product flue stream that is highly concentrated in CO2, which
practically  eliminates  the  need  for  post  separation  operations.  Pre-
combustion capture involves gasification of the fossil fuel into syngas
(i.e., mixture of CO and H2) by reacting it with steam and oxygen, fol-
lowed by the combustion of the syngas (or, hydrogen after a water-gas
shift reaction step) in a gas turbine to generate electricity. Here, CO2
is  separated  and  captured  from  the  shifted  syngas  usually  before  the
resulting  hydrogen  is  combusted  in  a  gas  turbine.  By  contrast,  post-
combustion  capture  refers  to  collection  and  removal  of  the  product
CO2 from the process flue stream after combustion has taken place. The
present article also introduces the promising yet nascent technology of
high  temperature  fuel  cells  that  excludes  nitrogen  from  entering  the
process stream and allows easy capture of the product CO2.

Given the magnitude of the global emissions challenge, a task force
report on CO2 utilization and negative emissions technologies by the U.
S.  -DOE  Energy  Advisory  Board  (SEAB)  [31]  has  considered  various
scenarios that offer the potential for the requisite annual capacity of ≥ 1
GtCO2, and estimated that investments of the order of $100 billion will
be required to achieve 1 GtCO2/yr. For such vast investments to mate-
rialize, carbon capture must be cost-effective and needs to create value
that is bigger than its cost. Indeed, the ‘Carbon Capture Program” of the
U.S. -DOE indicates that the cost of capture came down from $100/tCO2
in 2005 with ~30% energy penalty to ~$40/tCO2 in 2020 with ~10%
energy penalty for the produced power [102].

It should be noted that most projections for the future of energy and
CO2  emissions are unfortunately based on the implicit assumption and
de  facto  acceptance  of  air-based  combustion  to  largely  prevail  as  un-
challenged status quo into the foreseeable future for power generation as
well as for other industrial processes. However, there is no fundamental
reason or basis for this to be the case. Comparative costs may be the only
argument against it. However, do the current costs provide good enough
reasons to dismiss that option? In fact, oxygen-based combustion and
power  generation  processes  offer  attractive  options  [22],  which  are
largely
ignored  by  policy  and  decision  makers.  As  a  result,
post-combustion capture has acquired most of the attention and interest
amongst  other  options.  Naturally,  nitrogen  in  the  air,  as  an  inert
bystander  throughout  the  combustion-to-power  conversion  process
chain, makes it difficult to separate out and capture the CO2. Several
technology options for post-combustion capture are available for sepa-
rating CO2  from flue gas streams, including physical and chemical ab-
sorption  in  liquid  solvents,  adsorption  on  solids,  mineralization  (or
carbonation),  and  membrane  or  cryogenic  separation.  Criteria  for
selecting the optimal process to capture CO2  requires careful consider-
ation of the type, volume (or rate), and the CO2  concentration of the
emission source, as well as the economic and energy costs for the sep-
aration  process.  Among  the  criteria,  the  composition  of  the  flue  gas
deserves critical consideration, as the CO2  content of flue gasses differ
widely  among  stationary  power  generation  sources.  For  example,  the
nominal range of CO2 content in flue gasses is 3% to 5% for natural gas
turbines but 10% to 15% for pulverized coal fired plants, while it is 40%
to  60%  after  water  gas  shifting  for  integrated  gasification  combined
cycle (IGCC) plants.

3.2. Fundamental considerations

Separation of CO2  from air, combustion exhausts, or other process
gas mixtures emitted either from stationary point or distributed sources
needs to overcome the thermodynamic barrier of demixing. A simplified
flow diagram that summarizes the essential process steps is schemati-
cally  illustrated  in  Fig.  17,  where  the  exhaust  stream  (A)  from  an
emission source, or simply air, is fed into a CO2 capture process, which
produces a CO2-depleted stream (B) and a highly enriched or pure CO2
stream  (C).  Assuming  ideal  gas  behavior  for  all  process  streams,  the

theoretical minimum work, Wmin, to separate CO2 from a gas mixture in
the exhaust stream (or, air) is equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to
the free energy of mixing, and is given by the difference between the free
energies  of  the  streams  (B)  and  (C),  and  the  feed  stream  (A).  For  an
isothermal  and  isobaric  separation  process,  this  minimum  theoretical
work requirement can be expressed by Eq. (1).

Here, N represents the individual molar flux for streams (A), (B), and
(C), and Xi denotes the molar fractions of species i in the three streams,
respectively. Based on this 2nd Law analysis, the theoretical minimum
work  requirement  to  recover  CO2  from  air  (> 400  ppmv)  with  99%
purity, while exhausting a depleted stream with only 200 ppm is esti-
mated to be 20 kJ/mol of CO2  [103]. This value is in good agreement
with 22 kJ/mol of CO2 reported for the free energy of mixing of CO2 in
air  at  300 K  [104].  The  minimum  theoretical  work  requirement  de-
creases almost exponentially as the CO2 content of the feed gas supplied
to the separation unit increases. This is shown in Fig. 18, where mini-
mum requirements are presented for CO2 capture from several industrial
power generation processes. It is clear that it is energetically much less
expensive to separate out CO2  from point sources of power generation
than removing it from air. For example, the minimum theoretical work
needed to capture 90% of CO2 from pulverized coal combustion (PCC)
plant that emits a flue stream containing 12% CO2  is estimated to be

ture  either  from  exhaust  gas  mixtures  of  emission  sources,  or  CO2  capture

nitrogen  enters  the  combustion  process  stream  negating  the  need  for
post-separation.  Integrated  gasification  combined  cycle  (IGCC),  inte-
grated  gasification  fuel  cell  (IGFC),  oxy-combustion  and  chemical
looping combustion (CLC) technologies are discussed under this cate-
gory,  which  also includes  the  nascent  technology  of  carbon  fuel  cells
(CFC)  for  coal  conversion  that  offer  efficient  power  generation  with
nearly  capture-ready  CO2  production.  However,  as  the  focus  of  the
article is on carbon capture and not on fossil fuel-based power genera-
tion,  these  technologies  are  described  in  brevity  for  context  and
completeness only, and not intended for a comprehensive review.

4.1. Air separation technologies

Separating  oxygen  from  air  is  the  requisite  first  step  towards
achieving  pre-combustion  carbon  capture  from  oxy-combustion  and
gasification  technologies  [111].  The  theoretical  minimum  energy
required to separate oxygen from air is 176 MJ/tO2 (or, 49 Wh/kgO2). In
practice,  of  course,  the  actual  energy  penalty  may  be  several  times
higher than this theoretical minimum [112]. For example, air separation
units  (ASU)  using  cryogenic  distillation  may  demand  150  to
250 Wh/kgO2,  while  energy  demand  for  pressure  swing  adsorption
(PSA) and ion transport membrane (ITM) separation may require 250 to
300 Wh/kgO2  and 350 Wh/kgO2, respectively. Such high penalty may
consume up to 8% to 12% of the energy produced at the power plant
[113].  However,  use  of  pure  or  highly  enriched  oxygen  offers  the
advantage  of  easy  capture  for  fossil  fuel-based  thermoelectric  power
generation as the stack flue stream is highly enriched in the product CO2.
Air  is  the  most  abundant  and  cheapest  source  for  oxygen.  Global
market for oxygen production made up more than one quarter of the
world’s gas industry that generated over $87 billion in revenue in 2019
[114]. Several technology options are available to produce oxygen from
air, namely, cryogenic distillation, adsorption, and membrane separa-
tion [115,116], all of which require energy expenditures for separation.
◦
By contrast, high temperature (>650
C) fuel cells such as solid oxide
(SOFC) and molten carbonate fuel cells (MCFC) electrochemically pro-
vide oxygen in a downhill process while generating electricity not by
combustion  of  fuels  but  by  electro-oxidation.  This  is  an  important
distinction  and  offers  higher  conversion  efficiencies  in  fuel  cells.  The

Fig.  18. Minimum  theoretical  work  requirements  for  capturing  CO2  directly
from air or from flue streams of various power generation processes, where the
numerical ranges indicate the different CO2 purities and the percentage of CO2
recovered  [105].  Reproduced  with  permission  from  the  Annual  Review  of
Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering.

158.1 kJ/kgCO2  while  direct  capture  from  air  is  nearly  3  times  more
energy intensive at 482.5 kJ/kgCO2 [83]. As expected, the correspond-
ing minimum work requirements are lower for 50% CO2 recovery with
134.9 and 457.8 kJ/kgCO2  for PCC and direct air capture (DAC) pro-
cesses, respectively. Naturally, these theoretical requirements represent
a grossly underestimated benchmark for the actual energy penalty for
separation and capture. In real life, irreversibilities and various losses
along  the  process  pathway  increase  this  minimum  work  requirement
substantially. Moreover, this simplistic 2nd Law analysis considers only
work,  whereas  actual  separation  processes  to  remove  CO2  typically
involve both heat and work. Nevertheless, it provides a useful guiding
tool for CO2 capture from point and distributed sources, as well as from
air.

It was estimated that the energy penalty for CO2  separation could
amount to 25% to 40% of the energy production of a power plant and up
to 70% of the additional costs for CCS [106]. This study also estimated
that the energy cost for capturing and storing 80% of the CO2  emitted
from the U.S. coal-fired power fleet requires 69 to 92 GW of carbon-free
power  that results  in  15%  to  20%  reduction  in  the  overall  electricity
consumption. Increasing the power conversion efficiency to over 50%
can offset significant reductions in the energy penalty of CCS. As dis-
cussed later in Section 4.6, it is indeed possible to achieve conversion
efficiencies  of  50%  or  higher  with  the  added  benefit  of  producing
capture-ready CO2, using high temperature fuel cells for electrochemical
conversion of fossil fuels to electricity [30,107–110].

4. Pre-combustion carbon capture technologies

Typically,  pre-combustion  capture  involves  an  apriori  step  for  the
separation  of  oxygen  from  air,  followed  by  the  use  of  pure  or  highly
enriched (>90%) oxygen for the fuel combustion or gasification process.
This upstream separation process results in product flue gas that is made
primarily  of  capture-ready  CO2  and  water  vapor  as  practically  no

different  technological  options  for  air  separation  are  summarized  in
Table 4, which presents operating principles, nominal oxygen purities,
and state of commercialization of various oxygen production method-
ologies. Each offers technological and economic advantages and disad-
vantages, but not all of them are commercially available, and not all are
at the same level of maturity.

4.1.1. Cryogenic air separation

′

This  is  the  most  mature  and  reliable  technology  for  high  volume
oxygen production, and has been commercially available for many de-
cades.  It  is  based  fundamentally  on  the  principle  of  Joule-Thomson
refrigeration of air that is followed up by selective multi-stage distilla-
s of theoretical plates to obtain high purity (>95%) oxygen.
tion via 100
To achieve this, ambient air is compressed to ~1.3 MPa pressure and
expanded in subsequent steps to cool it down to the melting point of air
◦
((cid:0) 194.35
C). Subsequent cycles allow the liquid to increasingly enrich
◦
in oxygen (BP = (cid:0) 182.93
C), while the gas phase is enriched in nitrogen
◦
(BP = (cid:0) 195.8
C).  The  oxygen  is  extracted  in  liquid  form  from  the
distillation column, and is vaporized to gaseous oxygen before it is used
as feed into the intended process stream.

Cryogenic air separation requires about 240 Wh/kgO2  of energy to
produce  95% pure oxygen [117],  which presents a significant energy
penalty that reduces the plant power by nearly 15%. However, utilizing
the waste heat from the ASU significantly improves efficiency by up to
20% [116,118]. Arguably, cryogenic separation is the most convenient
and mature technology for the production of large volumes of oxygen.
Typical cryogenic plant sizes may vary between 30,000 and 50,000 Nm3
of O2 produced per hour, or 9000 to 15,000 tO2/day.

4.1.2. Adsorption-based air separation

Adsorption-based air separation [115] exploits the relative heats of
adsorption and desorption of nitrogen and oxygen on solid sorbents. In
other words, nitrogen and oxygen are separated in accordance with the
difference  in  their  binding  energies  to  the  sorbent  material  [119].
Activated carbons and most zeolite surfaces bind oxygen more strongly
than  nitrogen.  This  leads  to  preferential  enrichment  of  the  gas  phase
with  nitrogen  while  the  oxygen  populates  and  stays  on  the  sorbent
surface,  resulting  in  preferential  separation.  Zeolites  contain  atomic
scale crystallographic features in their structure that are conducive to
seize exclusion and sieving as well as selective adsorption. A variety of
other sorbents such as activated carbon, silica, and alumina are also used
for  air  separation  [120,121].  As  the  relative  binding  strengths  of
adsorbed species on solid surfaces vary with gas pressure and temper-
ature,  adsorption-based  air  separation  at  the  commercial  scale  is
generally  achieved  using  two  related  technologies,  namely,  pressure
swing adsorption (PSA) [122] and vacuum swing adsorption (VSA), or
temperature swing adsorption (TSA). They employ typically zeolites for
the sorbent material, and are mature and reliable technologies that have
been commercially available for several decades.

Unlike  cryogenic  separation  that  requires  extreme  refrigeration,
adsorption-based separation typically operates at ambient temperature,
but  has  modest  production  capacities  of  <1500  Nm3  O2  per  hour.
Moreover,  many  adsorption-desorption  cycles  may  be  necessary  to
obtain the desired purity of about 90% to 94% O2. The plant usually
employs two reactors operating in tandem. The exhaust gasses from the
pressurized stage 1 reactor is transferred to the unpressurized stage 2
reactor until the pressure in the latter is increased to the desired level.
The sequence is reversed in the next cycle.

4.1.3. Membrane-based air separation

Membrane-based air separation provides compact and modular so-
lutions for oxygen production [115,123,124]. Its modularity allows easy
scale  up  and  more  economical  use  of  plant  real  estate,  but  is  more
expensive than cryogenic separation, with higher capital costs and lower
production rates. All membranes achieve separation under the driving
force  of  a  chemical potential  or  pressure  gradient  externally  imposed

membranes, and (bottom) ion transport ceramic membranes (ITM). P denotes
partial pressure and μ is chemical potential. CO2  separation by polymeric and
microporous membranes involve transport of molecular oxygen and hence yield

permeability.

across  the  membrane.  Basically,  there  are  three  major  types  of  mem-
brane  technologies  with  vastly  different  operating  principles  as  illus-
trated in Fig. 19. In polymeric membranes, air separation is achieved by
relative dissolution and diffusion of O2  and N2  through the structural
voids in between the polymer chains, while in microporous inorganic
membranes, which are usually made of ceramics, separation is achieved
by selective, or differential adsorption, desorption and pore diffusion of
O2 and N2. Composite membranes combine the advantages of polymers
and  solid  sorbents  to  modify  separation  properties  such  as  selectivity
[125,126].These  two  basic  types  of  membranes  and  their  composites
operate typically at temperatures close to ambient.

By contrast, membranes based on lattice transport of oxide ions (i.e.,
ion- or oxygen transport membranes (ITM or OTM)) proposed several
◦
decades ago [127] operate above 700
C and are made of highly doped
mixed conducting ceramics typically of the perovskite family of oxides
that offer selective transport of oxide ions via vacancy diffusion through
its  crystal  lattice  [128],  and  accomplishes  absolute  separation,  i.e.,
production of 100% pure oxygen from air [129].

Among the three membrane categories, only ITM offers the ability to
provide absolute selectivity to produce 100% O2, while polymeric and
microporous  membranes  can  produce  enriched  oxygen  with  purities
>35%O2. Membranes in all three categories require pressurization of air
on the feed side in order to maintain a concentration gradient across the
membrane that drives transport and preferential separation.

4.2. Oxy-combustion

Oxy-combustion  [130–134]  employs  pure  or  enriched  oxygen

usually from an air separation unit and yields flame temperatures in the
◦
vicinity  of  2500
C  in  high  temperature  boiler  designs,  and  around
◦
1600
C in low temperature boiler designs. A typical process flow dia-
gram of oxy-combustion is schematically illustrated in Fig. 20. The ad-
vantages of oxy-combustion include retrofitting on existing power plants
[136], smaller physical size, and most importantly, the ability to pro-
duce capture-ready CO2 without the need for extensive post-separation
operations, provided that highly pure oxygen is utilized for combustion.
On the other hand, the high flame temperatures in the boiler require
high temperature tolerant materials that are usually more expensive and
with shorter lifetimes. This problem is mitigated by recycling part of the
combustion products back into the boiler in order to dilute the reaction
system  and  lower  the  boiler  temperature  as  well  as  help  reduce  tem-
perature gradients in the boiler. The advantage of oxy-combustion for
ease of carbon capture from fossil fuel-based power generation is illus-
trated in Table 5, which compares the compositions of boiler flue gas
streams  from  air-based  and  oxy-combustion  of  bituminous  and
sub-bituminous coals [137].

Typically, cryogenic air separation is the preferred choice to produce
highly  enriched  (~95%)  oxygen  for  oxy-combustion  [111,116,118].
However, other means of oxygen production have also been considered,
including  polymeric  membranes,  composite  membranes,  nanotubular
carbon membranes, molecular sieve membranes, microporous ceramic
membranes as well as mixed ionically-electronically conducting (MIEC)
dense ceramic membranes, also called ITMs [111]. Although ITMs offer
absolute  selectivity  for  oxygen,  slow  and  highly  thermally  activated
lattice transport of oxide ions in the MIEC ceramic structure limits their
oxygen production rates. In addition to their unique capability to pro-
duce 100% pure oxygen while excluding other gaseous species including
N2, MIECs are also interesting for their catalytic properties and inves-
tigated for catalytic combustors that also provide an alternative option

easy  capture.  35%  O2  in  CO2  was  employed  for  flue  gas  recycle  in  oxy-com-
bustion [137].

for oxy-combustion [131,138]. Depending partly on the purity of oxy-
gen used, oxy-combustion of fossil fuels produces nearly capture ready
CO2  emissions. Unlike air-based pulverized coal power generation, the
product stream from oxy-combustion usually contains about 70% CO2
plus  water  vapor,  as  nitrogen  does  not  enter  the  process  stream,
rendering it easy to capture the CO2  from the flue stream. Absence of
nitrogen during oxy-combustion also produces nearly 75% less flue gas
volume  to  process.  When  compared  to  air-based  combustion,
oxy-combustion is reported to produce 66% less NOx and 30% less SOx
emissions [139]. But due to the absence of the diluent N2, the concen-
tration of impurities in the flue gas including inert gasses, HCl, SO2, ash,
and Hg are generally higher in oxy-combustion than in air-based com-
bustion  processes,  and  their  removal  pose  challenges  [140,141].  In
particular, high concentrations of SO2, HCl as well as fly ash in the boiler
lead to corrosion and require expensive materials of construction, and
also  increase  the  energy  demand  for  both  the  CO2  compression  and
transport steps towards storage purposes [136,142]. There  have been
excellent  review  articles  that  provide  in-depth  discussion  and  under-
standing  of  the  benefits  and  challenges  of  oxy-fuel  combustion  [130,
131,143,144].

Despite many advantages, oxy-combustion has not received the level
of interest and investments that it deserves. The major reason for this
was its cost. Indeed, the U.S. DOE had revived the former  FutureGen
program (until recently called, FutureGen 2.0 [145], which would have
provided about $1 billion assistance to FutureGen Alliance to develop
and  build  an  oxy-combustion  power  plant  (instead  of  the  originally
planned IGCC plant as designed in the former FutureGen program) in
place  of  the  168  MW  coal-fired  power  plant  near  Meredosia,  IL,  in
cooperation with Ameren Energy Resources. This would have been the
world’s first commercial-scale oxy-combustion power plant fully inte-
grated with carbon capture and permanent geologic storage. Unfortu-
nately, due to concerns about failing to fulfill the legislative deadlines
imposed on the industrial partners to meet the financial commitments
within the agreed time frame, DOE decided once again to pull its support
from the program in 2015. Nevertheless, there have been several pilot
plant size demonstration projects in oxy-combustion many of them with
capacities less than 100 MW with a handful of plants that are rated >
200 MW [132,145]. Although much of the challenges in CO2  capture
and compression, flue gas treatment, and optimization and control of the
oxy-combustion process definitely benefit from decades-long experience
in air-based combustion know-how, some of the remaining barriers that
need to be overcome include cost-effective and at-scale pure O2 supply,
demonstration  of  high  performance  at  large  industrial  scale,  public
acceptance of CCS and appropriate pricing of carbon emissions.

4.3. Chemical looping combustion

Chemical looping combustion [146–148] is an emerging technology
and  involves  delivering  the  oxygen  for  combustion  in  the  form  of  a

suitable metal oxide, which serves as the oxygen carrier. The oxide is
reduced upon reaction with coal or natural gas in the fuel reactor. The
reduced carrier is recycled into an air reactor where it is re-oxidized.
Oxidation  and  reduction  rates  of  the  particular  oxygen  carrier
employed  are  primarily  governed  by  the  defect  chemistry  and  defect
transport rates in the crystal lattice of the metal oxide [149].

The  CLC  process  is  illustrated  in  Fig.  21.  The  fuel  reacts  with  the
oxygen carrying oxide material in the fuel reactor, abstracting oxygen
from the oxide and reducing it. As no nitrogen enters the reactor, the flue
gasses from the reactor are highly concentrated in CO2 and H2O (steam).
The reduced oxide is regenerated in the air reactor and fed back into the
combustion  reactor  to  repeat  the  CLC  cycle.  The  combustion  product
CO2  can  easily  be  captured  from  the  flue  stream,  primarily  by
condensing out the water vapor. Both reactors operate at temperatures
◦
around 900
C. This is considerably lower than for oxy-combustion, and
provides  operational  and  cost  advantage.  The  efficiencies  for  power
generation and CO2  capture from coal-CLC were estimated to be 48%
and 98%, respectively [151].

Unlike  oxy-combustion,  CLC  does  not  require  prior  separation  of
oxygen  from  air.  Instead  it  uses  an  internal  redox  cycle  of  a  suitable
metal-oxygen system to provide the oxygen for combustion. Two general
categories  of  oxygen  carrying  oxides  have  been  investigated  for  CLC,
namely, those undergo phase change during the redox cycle, and those
do  not.  Comparison  of  the  theoretical  oxygen  carrying  potentials  of
select oxides is illustrated in Table 6. Major advantages of CLC include
elimination of the capital, operating and energy costs associated with
oxygen separation. On the other hand, CLC requires two reactors oper-
ating in tandem for closing the redox cycle, and involves high operating
temperatures.

Oxygen carriers can be chosen from simple binary oxides based upon
common  transition  metals  such  as  Cu,  Ni,  Fe,  Mn  in  bulk  particulate
form or dispersed on a suitable support [152,153]. Naturally occurring
ores of Cu, Fe, Mn and Ca [154] as well as others, such as ilmenite [154]
have  also  been  considered  as  oxygen  carriers.  As  expected,  oxidation
and  reduction  cycles  of  these  oxides  are  accompanied  by  significant
changes  in  their  molar  volumes  due  to  phase  transformations.  As  a
result, internal stresses induced by these repetitive structural and phase
transformations  in  the  material  compromise  and  degrade  their  me-
chanical stability and durability upon prolonged use.

Alternatively,  heavily defective multi-component oxides offer oxy-
gen  abstraction  and uptake  without  commensurate  structural change,
which eliminates some of the durability problems of phase-change ox-
ygen carriers. On the other hand, their maximum oxygen carrying ca-
pacities are inferior when compared to phase change oxide systems, as
indicated  in  Table  6.  These  oxides  are  typically  of  the  parent  ABO3
perovskite  structure, where  heavy extrinsic doping of the A and/or B

sites in the cation sublattice is charge-compensated by the creation of
vacant sites in the oxygen sublattice in the crystal structure. Under a
chemical  potential  gradient,  these  vacancies  facilitate  oxide  ions  to
diffuse  through  the  crystal lattice,  and  provide  absolute  selectivity  of
oxygen
such  as  A-site  doped
La1–xSrxMnO3–d or A-and B-site doped La1–xSrxCo1–yFeyO3–d exhibit wide
nonstoichiometry in the oxygen sublattice and fast oxide ion transport
[127,155], and allow rapid oxygen release or uptake without undergo-
ing structural or phase transformations. Such nonstoichiometric oxides
can be considered as alternative options for oxygen carriers provided of
course that they possess the proper redox stability window within the
reduction and oxidation limits at the operating temperature during CLC
cycling  [156].  On  the  other  hand,  these  multicomponent  non-
stoichiometric oxides are made of less abundant and costly elements and
have heavy molar masses. Hence, simple oxide systems including Cu and
Ni, which are cheaper and more abundant have been the preferred ox-
ygen carrier systems studied for CLC [152,153]. A recent review article
discusses  the  successful  testing  of  low  cost  oxygen  carriers  during
extended CLC cycling of solid fuels with encouraging results in carrier
lifetime, reactivity and performance, suggesting the viability of CLC for
cost effective CO2 capture [157].

4.4. Integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC)

′

Gasification offers many advantages over conventional combustion
technologies, and there have been a handful of integrated gasification
combined cycle (IGCC) plants many of which have been operating since
the  mid  1990
s  in  various  countries  around  the  world.  More  recent
projects  in  the  world  include  the  618  MW  IGCC  power  plant  in
Edwardsport, IN, in the U.S.A., which has been operating since 2013, the
650 MW GreenGen IGCC polygeneration project in Tianjin City in China,
and  250  MW  IGCC  Nakoso  Power  Station  in  Fukushima,  Japan.
Although they all aim at capturing at least part of their CO2 emissions,
none have demonstrated CCS at commercial scale yet. Recent cancel-
lations due to the widely underestimated budget of nearly AUD 7 billion
for the ZeroGen IGCC project in Australia, and massive cost overruns
($2.4 billion initial budget versus projected costs exceeding $7 billion)
of the Kemper County IGCC project [158] in Mississippi in the U.S.A at a
planned capacity of 582 MW with annual CO2 capture capacity of 3 Mt
was  indicative  of  the  treacherous  and  expensive  pathway  towards
achieving  ‘clean  coal  power’  [159].  However,  a  recent  commentary
from  the  International  Energy  Agency  (IEA)  [160]  argued  that  such
failures  should  not  discourage  or  deter  the  efforts  to  advance  carbon
capture projects, which are essential for continued use of fossil fuels for
electric power production.

The advantages of IGCC include ease of capturing CO2  before it is
released into the environment, options for gas cleanup, and the flexi-
bility and versatility it offers for product distribution. The process pri-
marily involves the conversion of the solid fuel such as coal or biomass in
the presence of steam or carbon dioxide to a synthesis gas (or, syngas)
that  consists  primarily  of  CO  and  H2.  In  the  context  of  natural  gas,

T.M. Gür

similar reaction of steam with the primary component methane as well
as other hydrocarbons in natural gas is usually called steam reforming.
However, gasification of solid fuels and reforming of gaseous (or, liquid)
fuels all produce syngas as product, and both are highly endothermic
reactions, where heat must be provided to the system externally in order
to  drive  the  gasification  and  reforming  reactions  thermally.  Heat  re-
quirements of major reactions relevant to reforming and gasification are
summarized  in  Table  7.  After  gas  clean  up,  the  syngas  may  undergo
water  gas  shift  reaction  with  additional  steam,  to  produce  more
hydrogen which is typically combusted in a gas turbine for electricity
generation. The term gasification is commonly  used when the feed is
coal or other solid fuels such as biomass, while reforming is used when
the  feed  is  natural  gas  or  other  gaseous  or  liquid  hydrocarbons.
Accordingly, the former process is labeled IGCC, while the latter is called
natural gas combined cycle (NGCC).

Gasification (or, reforming) provides an effective and environmen-
tally  friendly  way  of  converting  coal  (or,  natural  gas)  into  electricity
with carbon capture. It can also be employed for co-generation or pol-
ygeneration, i.e., production of electricity as well as hydrogen and other
high value chemicals [161]. Rather than combusting, the fuel is broken
up  into  its  chemical  constituents  during  the  gasification  process.  The
primary purpose of gasification is to transform coal or other solid fuels
into  cleaner  fuels  with  great  environmental  benefits  in  the  form  of
significantly lower emissions of SOx, NOx, particulates, heavy metals and
other  coal  contaminants.  Coal  gasification  produces  a  highly  concen-
trated (up to 90%) CO2 product stream and largely eliminates the need
for post separation operations to capture the product CO2.

A generalized process flow diagram for a polygeneration IGCC plant,
which  employs  an  ASU  to  produce  oxygen  and  utilizes  it  for  steam
gasification,  is  depicted  in  Fig.  22.  It  illustrates  the  ability  of  poly-
generation to capture CO2  and also produce electricity, hydrogen and
chemicals. The plant stack gasses are primarily CO2  and steam, which
are easy to separate for carbon capture. The process provides flexibility
to employ either gas turbines to produce electricity or high temperature
fuel cells to electrochemically convert syngas (or, hydrogen) into elec-
tricity.  It  also  offers  co-generation  capability  by  allowing  power  and
hydrogen production via membrane separation (usually made of Pd al-
loys) as well as downstream production of useful chemicals and fuels,
achievable subsequently via the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis process.

As in oxy-combustion, oxygen is a key component of the IGCC pro-
cess  and  is  used  for  burning  a  portion  of  the  coal  to  supply  the  heat
necessary  to  drive  the  endothermic  gasification  reaction.  Typically
cryogenic type of ASU is employed for large-scale oxygen production at
~95% purity. The energy penalty imposed by the air separation unit is
usually around 10–12% of the generated power and naturally burdens
the overall plant conversion efficiency [113].

4.5. Integrated gasification fuel cell (IGFC)

Incorporation of a high temperature fuel cell into the IGCC process
stream,  as  in  integrated  gasification  fuel  cell  (IGFC),  offers  many  ad-
including  higher  efficiency  of  electrochemical  power
vantages

generation  compared  to  most  thermal  conversion  processes.  This
approach,  schematically  illustrated  in  Figs.  23,  involves  a  fuel  cell  -
typically  a  solid  oxide  fuel  cell  (SOFC)  -  coupled  to  the  process  flow
downstream of the steam gasification and gas clean up steps. Coal syngas
from gasification is cleaned of sulfur and other contaminants before it is
fed into a SOFC for electrochemical power generation at elevated tem-
◦
C. In IGFC, air separation, gasification and
peratures in excess of 700
gas clean up processes involve separate steps, which are all external to
the fuel cell.

′

Early attempts that adopted variants of this approach were pursued
by Westinghouse Power Corp [163–165] (now Siemens Power Genera-
tion Corp.), Stanford Research Institute [166–168] (SRI) and others in
the 1960
s. Currently the US Department of Energy through
its Advanced Energy Systems - Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Program (formerly,
the Solid State Energy Alliance (SECA) program) [169] is supporting the
development of an integrated gasification fuel cell (IGFC) technology in
a catalytic gasifier-SOFC system.

s and 1970

′

More importantly,  incorporation of fuel  cells into  fossil fuel-based
power  generation  as  in  IGFC  and  natural  gas  fuel  cell  (NGFC)  offer
improved  plant  efficiencies  and  competitive  economics  for  cost  of
electricity  (COE).  Comparative  estimates  by  the  U.S.  Department  of
Energy [170] that also accounts for the energy and economic burden of
CCS on plant efficiency as well as COE for several advanced coal- and
natural gas-based thermoelectric power technologies demonstrate that
inclusion of fuel cells offer the potential to achieve higher performance
and efficiency at less cost than conventional power technologies. Results
of this DOE study are presented in Fig. 24, and promise the prospects of
efficient  and  cost-effective  generation  of  zero-carbon  electric  power
from  fossil  fuels  while  fully  capturing  the  highly  concentrated  CO2
product with considerable ease. However, this approach still requires an
ASU, which typically reduces the overall plant efficiency and increases
capital costs. For example, a recent study estimated that cryogenic-based
ASU may account for nearly 14% of the capital cost and can consume
10–40%  of  the  gross  power  output  of  an  oxy-fuel  combustion  plant
[111].  The  need  for  an  ASU  can  completely  be  eliminated  by  direct
conversion of the fuel to electricity inside the fuel cell proper, where the
oxidation products are highly concentrated CO2 and moisture.

4.6. Carbon fuel cells

With the impending challenge of mitigating climate change and the
need to capture CO2 from fossil fuel-based power generation, there have
been renewed interest and promising advances in the development of
specialized  fuel  cells  that  aim  towards  efficient  conversion  of  solid
carbonaceous fuels such as coal to electricity with capture-ready CO2
production  [171–174].  These  types  of  fuel  cells  are  interchangeably
called  carbon  fuel  cells  (CFC),  direct  carbon  fuel  cells  (DCFC),  or
carbon-air fuel cells (CAFC), and offer two critically important advan-
tages,  namely,  higher  conversion  efficiencies  and  concentrated  CO2
product streams. Needless to say, high efficiencies and low emissions are
imperative for sustainability and climate change mitigation.

In essence, carbon fuel cell (CFC) is an electrochemical engine that is

capable of converting the chemical energy of solid carbonaceous fuels
into electricity in a single chamber. In a similar manner, solid oxide fuel
cells  (SOFC)  have  been  developed  for  electrochemical  conversion  of
natural  gas  to  electricity  [109],  and  Bloom  Energy  in  California  has
already  commercialized  their  natural  gas-fed  SOFC  power  units.  The
SOFC structures and corresponding dominant reactions for carbon and
methane conversion, respectively, are illustrated in Fig. 25. These high
temperature fuel cells do not require an ASU as oxygen is supplied by
selective  transport  through  an  ionically  conducting  dense  solid  elec-
trolyte, typically yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ), thus avoiding the en-
ergy  penalty  for  oxygen  separation  suffered  by  IGFC,  IGCC  and
oxy-combustion technologies. Oxide ion transport through the electro-
lyte is accompanied by electron flow in the external circuit. During the
fuel  conversion  process,  eight  electrons  are  released  to  the  external
circuit for each CH4 molecule oxidized at the anode, while four electrons
are  released  for  each  carbon  atom  consumed  in  the  solid  fuel.  These
electrons travel through the external circuit from the anode towards the
cathode to reduce the molecular oxygen in the air to oxide ions, and at
the  same  time  perform  useful  electrical  work.  More  importantly,  the
major reaction products exiting the fuel cell are highly concentrated CO2
and steam, which are easy to separate for CO2 capture.

There are several types of CFCs labeled after the type of electrolyte
they  employ.  Solid  oxide-based  fuel  cells  (SO-CFC)  employ  ionically
conducting  ceramic  electrolytes  such  as  yttria-stabilized  zirconia  that
selectively  transport  oxide  ions  (O2(cid:0)
)  via  lattice  diffusion  of  oxygen
vacancies. Since this transport is highly thermally activated,  SO-CFCs

CFCs  achieve  conversion  of  coal  directly  to  electrical  power  via
electrochemical oxidation, and not by combustion. This is an important
distinction. It should be noted, however, “direct”  conversion does not
necessarily  suggest  direct  electro-oxidation  of  the  fossil  fuel  itself
directly, as oxidation products CO2  and H2O undergo further gasifica-
tion in the case of coal or other solid fuels, and reforming in the case of
natural  gas,  providing  positive  feedback  reaction  loops  as  shown  in
Fig. 25. These gasification and reforming reactions further lead to water
gas shift reactions. So in a strict sense, the term “direct” indicates that
conversion process takes place in the fuel cell proper, regardless of the
details  and  the  nature  of  the  chemical  and  electrochemical  reactions
taking place.

Another major advantage of CFCs is to reduce the number of process
steps and more importantly negate the need of oxygen separation in an
ASU. This is in contrast to gasification and combustion technologies that
require not only air separation units for oxygen production - for IGCC,
NGCC, IGFC and NGFC technologies –  but also multiple process steps
thereafter (see Figs. 22 and 23). Collectively, these multitude of indi-
vidual process steps introduce efficiency losses as expected. By contrast,
CFCs  advance  the  potential  opportunities  beyond  IGFC  and  NGFC  by
internally and thermally integrating the gasification (or, reforming, in
the case of natural gas) process inside the fuel cell proper, or chamber.
This  offers  greater  benefits  in  performance  and  efficiency,  but  more
importantly, ease of carbon capture, as CFCs eliminate the need for an
external ASU and/or a separate gasifier. The oxidant needed to gasify
and oxidize the fuel is provided electrochemically through the fuel cell’s
electronically insulating but ionically conducting electrolyte. Modified
architectures  of  typical  solid  oxide-  (SOFC)  [107]  and  molten
carbonate-based  fuel  cells  (MCFC)  [178[,or  their  hybrids,  namely,
molten  carbonate/solid  oxide  electrolyte  configurations  [177]  have
been  shown  to  be  suitable  configurations  for  achieving  efficient  con-
version of solid fuels to electricity.

Obviously, combining multiple process steps of the IGFC and NGCC
processes into a single process inside the fuel cell proper promises higher
electrical  conversion  efficiencies  exceeding  60%  [108],  simplicity  in
plant design, better thermal management and control, smaller real es-
tate, and potentially lower capital and operational costs. It may be ex-
pected that these savings promise an even more favorable comparison
with other power generation technologies presented in Fig. 24. Selective
transport of the oxidant (oxide ions in the case of SOFC, and carbonate

ions in the case of MCFC) through the fuel cell electrolyte facilitates the
gasification and oxidation reactions of the fossil fuel inside the cell, and
eliminates  the  need  for  an  ASU,  which  otherwise  reduces  the  overall
plant efficiency typically by 8% to 12% [113,131]., Although significant
advances were made in internally and thermally integrating gasification
with solid oxide fuel cells [107,176–178], carbon conversion in fuel cells
possesses  inherent  difficulties  and  technical  challenges  as  examined
elsewhere [30,179–181] and plausible mechanistic pathways to achieve
electrochemical  conversion  in  a  variety  of  CFC  configurations  were
proposed [182]. Much progress has been made recently in both under-
standing fundamental issues as well as improving cell performance, but
much  work  still  remains  to  advance  this  nascent  and  important
technology.

Although gaseous (e.g., methane) as well as solid carbonaceous fuels
such  as  coal  and  biomass  [22,23,30,107–109]  can  be  converted  to
electrical energy in SO-CFCs with the emission of highly concentrated
CO2 flue streams, there are technical challenges to be overcome. These
include the high energy barrier for methane oxidation due to the diffi-
culty in activating the strong C-H bond [109], difficulty to oxidize solid
carbon fuels due to poor solid-to-solid contact between the fuel and the
anode  surface  [182],  anode  deactivation  and  cell  degradation  due  to
sulfur poisoning, interplay among electrochemical oxidation of the fuel
with chemical reactions of gasification or reforming and water gas shift,
difficulty in achieving truly direct electrochemical oxidation of the fuel
[30], thermal and microstructural durability and stability of cell mate-
rials  and  components,  and  among  others,  materials  and  fabrication
costs.

For  MC-CFCs,  the  challenges  are  different.  Molten  carbonate  fuel
cells  cannot  directly  process  or  convert  methane,  as  the  solubility  of
methane in the alkali carbonate eutectic is rather small. However, they
can  employ  methane  in  the  form  of  hydrogen  or  syngas  (i.e.,  CO-H2
mixture) only after methane undergoes steam reforming in an external
reformer [30,109]. On the other hand, MC-CFCs are suitable to handle
and convert solid carbonaceous fuels such as coal, biomass, waste etc.
into electrical energy [176]. The challenges to conversion of solid fuels
in MC-CFCs include hot corrosion and stability of the molten electrolyte,
degree of percolation (or electrical connectivity) as well as wetting of
solid fuel particles in the molten electrolyte, sensitivity to moisture – a
byproduct  of  coal  or  biomass  oxidation,  parasitic  side  reactions

[30,179,181]. Hybrid-CFCs [180] borrow these shared challenges from
each, in addition to the long-term chemical stability of the solid oxide
ceramic electrolyte in the highly corrosive and strong solvation action of
the molten carbonate electrolyte [30,177].

potential for mitigating carbon emissions especially from point sources,
because  many  of  the  technologies  in  this  category  can  be  added  to
existing power plants without major disruptions or changes in the pro-
cess flow. Post-combustion capture technologies are designed to aim at
separating and capturing CO2 from N2-rich product gasses after the air-
combustion  step  but  before  releasing  the  flue  gasses  into  the  atmo-
sphere,  although  other  contaminants  may  also  impact  the  choice  of
capturing method. Typical composition of flue gas streams from coal-
fired  power  plants  are  compared  in  Table  8  to  flue  gas  compositions
from  water  gas  shifted  coal  gasification  and  water  gas  shifted  steam
reforming of methane. With practically no N2 present in the product flue
stream, it is clear that pre-combustion does not necessitate separation of
CO2  in  the  latter  two  processes.  For  post-combustion  from  coal-fired
power  generation,  on the  other  hand,  the  method  of  choice  demands
high selectivity for CO2  in the presence of high concentrations of N2,
with minimal interference from other contaminants.

A  wide  variety  of  CO2  capture  technologies  are  employed  down-
stream of the combustion process. Mechanistically, they differ widely in
the way each accomplishes CO2 separation and capture. They primarily
involve  absorption,  adsorption,  mineralization,  membrane  and  cryo-
genic  separation,  as  well  as  electrochemical  separation  via  fuel  cells.
Regardless  of  the  type,  however,  CO2  separation  and  capture  adds
considerable penalty to the overall process in both energy and cost.

Indeed,  a  recent  thermodynamic  study  [106]  for  post-combustion
capture  and  storage  of  CO2  from  coal-fired  plants  has  estimated  the
lower bound of the energy penalty to be 24 kJ/molCO2 into a 2-km deep
underground  injection  cavity,  assuming  perfect  2nd  law  efficiencies.
Moreover,  the  energy  requirements  for  carbon  capture  and  storage
(CCS)  for  pressure  swing  adsorption  (PSA)  and  temperature  swing
adsorption  (TSA)  processes  were  estimated  to  be  75 kJ/molCO2  and
45 kJ/molCO2, respectively, assuming no compression losses and per-
fect separation. Analyzing the spread of the actual thermal efficiencies of
420  large  size  U.S.  installed  coal-fired  plants,  which  showed  a  near
Gaussian distribution of end efficiencies between 46% and 18% where
the  average  was  ~33%,  this  study  further  concluded  that  the  energy
penalty for capturing and storing 80% of the CO2  emissions from the
entire U.S. pulverized coal (PC) fired power fleet is expected to require
an additional 390 to 600 million tons of coal (at nominal 25 MJ/kg), or
an additional 69 to 92 GW of CO2-free base-load of power, which con-
stitutes 15% to 20% reduction in the overall electricity production.

Many technological options exist for separating CO2  from flue gas
streams. Selection of the optimal process largely depends on factors such
as the type, production volume (or, rate), flue gas composition, and the

5.1. CO2  capture by liquid sorbents

Post-combustion CO2 capture in liquid solvents can be achieved both
by  physical  or  chemical  absorption.  The  latter  usually  involves  a
chemical  reaction  step,  which  is  not  the  case  in  physical  absorption.
Both types of absorption rely on the interfacial equilibrium between the
flue gas stream and the absorbent liquid phase, and employ a two-step
process.  First,  the  product  flue  gas  is  preferentially  stripped  off  from
its CO2 content by contact with a suitable solvent in an absorption tower,
then the absorbed CO2  is removed from the solvent in a regeneration
tower, which also recovers the solvent for the next batch of CO2 capture
step.  As  the  solubility  of  gasses  in  liquids  increases  with  decreasing
temperature and increased pressure, the absorption process is usually
carried out at low temperature and/or high pressure, while the regen-
eration step to recover both the CO2 and the solvent involve high tem-
low
peratures  and/or
concentrations of CO2  in the flue gas from natural gas turbines (3% to
5%) and coal-fired plants (10% to 15%) require the use of absorption
towers with large contactor areas and consequently higher capital and
energy costs for effective CO2 capture.

low  pressures.  Moreover,  the  relatively

Historically,  liquid  solvent  processes  primarily  based  on  aqueous
solutions of alkali metal hydroxides that chemically react and remove
CO2 have been employed for nearly a century as part of the life support
systems  in  confined  environments  including  submarines  and  space
crafts,  where  the  resulting  precipitates  of  the  insoluble  alkali  metal
carbonates are filtered and removed from the solution. This specialized
process,  however,  is  not  suitable  for  carbon  capture  from  large  point
sources such as coal-fired power plants.

For effective capture of CO2 from massive volumes of the flue gasses
emitted from power plants, exceptionally large interfacial contact area is
required to overcome the mass transfer resistance that exists at the gas/
liquid  interface of  the  absorber  column. This  mass  transfer  limitation
generally  necessitates  the  use  of  large  volume  absorbers,  which  add
significant cost to the capture system and may constitute up to 55% of
the total capital cost [191].

5.1.1. Capture by chemical absorption

Chemical  absorption  involves  a  reaction  step  between  the  solvent
and  the  solute,  in  this  case  CO2.  Generally  amine-based  solutions  are
considered for carbon capture as they have been used already for gas
clean  up  in  several  industries,  although  the  processes  are  costly  and
energy intensive. To increase capture rate and efficiency as well as to
lower  costs,  numerous  compounds  are  being  investigated,  including
ammonium-based solvents.

5.1.1.1. CO2 capture in amine-based solutions. Aqueous amine solutions
have been employed commercially in the gas industry for more than half
a century to strip CO2  by chemical absorption with CO2  recovery effi-
ciencies up to 98% [192], although for large scale applications 70% to
95% capture efficiency is likely more realistic. Primary challenges for
CO2 capture in aqueous amine solutions include corrosion to equipment
and  materials,  thermal  degradation  of  amines,  and  high  energy  con-
sumption. The production of amines primarily involves the reaction of
ammonia  with  ethylene  oxide.  However,  commercial  production  of
ammonia  is  highly  energy  intensive  (consumes  >1%  world’s  energy
supply) and inherently has a large CO2  footprint on its own. The esti-
mates of CO2 emissions from ammonia synthesis range from 1.15 to 1.40
kgCO2/kgNH3  [193] to 1.87 kgCO2/kgNH3  [194]. Hence, the cumula-
tive impact of amine-based CO2  capture on the environmental is quite
significant beyond the capture process per se, and must also account for

the CO2 emitted during the upstream production of ammonia.

The  tail-end  technology  of  amine-based  separation  is  reasonably
mature, and is readily suitable and adoptable for CO2 capture from the
flue streams of coal-fired power plants and other point emission sources
[195–197]. The process involves CO2 absorption from a flue gas stream
into a low volatility aqueous amine solution near ambient conditions.
Upon absorption in the scrubber, the amine solution is then regenerated
◦
by  stripping  it  with  steam  at  100  to  120
C.  The  resulting  vapor  is
condensed  to  remove  water  and  the  released  CO2  is  recovered  and
generally compressed to ~15 MPa for storage. Typically alkolamines are
employed for this purpose and the most commonly used amine solutions
contain monoethanolamine (MEA), diethanolamine (DEA), or N-meth-
yldiethynolamine (MDEA). In practice, 20% to 30% MEA solutions are
more  commonly  employed  for  CO2  capture  than  others.  Other  pro-
spective solvents of this group also include piperazine (PZ) and its de-
rivatives, which exhibit better thermal stability and higher CO2 capture
capacity than MEA, but also have higher vapor pressure that may limit
their practical application. At the same time, greater capacity for CO2
uptake minimizes heat losses during heating and cooling between ab-
sorption  and  regeneration  cycles.  These  advanced  amine  systems  can
capture  CO2  with  a  heat  duty  of  < 2.7 MJ/tCO2  and  work  <
250 kWh/tCO2  including  compression  of  the  captured  CO2  to  15 MPa
[80]. Many of the physicochemical properties of select amine solutions
are summarized in Table 9. They exhibit CO2 absorption fluxes that vary
(cid:0) 7  mol-
between  2.4 × 10
CO2/m2.Pa (for AMP/PZ). Naturally high capacities for CO2  uptake as
well as high temperature limitations for amine regeneration are desired
properties, although high Pmax is indicative of high vapor pressure and is
undesirable.  Some  piperazine  (PZ)-based  solutions  exhibit  relatively
high CO2 uptake capacities approaching 1 molCO2/kg with sufficiently
high  tolerance  to  high  temperatures  during  regeneration  when
compared to commonly employed monoethanolamine (MEA) solutions.
General categorization of alkolamines includes primary, secondary
and tertiary amines containing at least one hydroxyl and amine group.
Examples of primary amines are monoethanolamine (MEA) and digly-
colamine,  while  diethanolamine  (DEA)  and  diisopropanolamine  are
examples  of  secondary  amines.  N-methyldiethynolamine  (MDEA)  and
triethanolamine (TEA) are tertiary amines. The reactivity towards CO2
increases  with  amine  ranking,  while  the  CO2  capacity  does  not.  For
example, the capacity is about 1 molCO2/mol of tertiary amine, which is
significantly higher than the average CO2 capacity of ~0.5 molCO2/mol
of  primary  and  secondary  amine.  On  the  other  hand,  CO2  reactivity

C,  a  recent
study on the thermodynamic and kinetic characterization of nearly 30
different aqueous 30% amine solutions at 0.1 MPa pressure found that
hexamethylenediamine  (HMD)  exhibited  the  highest  loading  of  1.35
molCO2/mol of amine, and triethanolamine (TEA) showed the lowest
loading  at  0.39  molCO2/mole  amine,  while  the  loading  levels  of  the
commonly  employed  monoethanolamine  (MEA)  and  diethanolamine
(DEA) were 0.58 and 0.53 mol CO2/mole of amine, respectively [198].
The  underlying  principle  of  amine-based  absorption  involves  the
formation  of  water-soluble  compounds  such  as  carbamates  and  bi-
carbonates when amines react with CO2. This reaction is driven by the
fact  that  amine  solutions  are  basic  in  character  while  CO2  is  mildly
acidic, thus facilitating a chemical reaction.

The absorption reactions for the primary and secondary amines with
CO2  form  a  zwitterion  (a  neutral  molecule  containing  negatively  and
positively charged groups) first and then a carbamate salt as expressed
by,

RR’NH + CO2 = RR’NH+COO(cid:0)

+

RR’NCOO(cid:0) + H2O = RR’NH + HCO3

(cid:0)

(5)

The  major  drawback  for  amine-scrubbing  is  the  high  energy
requirement  for  the  solvent  regeneration  step  at  high  temperatures.
Especially MEA is not a particularly energy efficient and environmen-
tally friendly solvent for CO2 capture. It is also a costly process. An early
techno-economic  analysis  [199]  of  MEA-based  CO2  capture  from  a
coal-fired power plant of 500 MW gross capacity, the energy penalty for
capturing 84% of the CO2 brings the net plant capacity from 462 MW for
the control case without CO2 capture down to 326 MW with capture, and
increases  the  cost  of  electricity  nearly  100%  with  capture.  It  clearly
shows that CO2  capture demands a parasitic power of more than 130
MW  or  32%  of  the  produced  power  capacity.  This  techno-economic
study also concluded that the cost of carbon capture is expected to be
higher for retrofitting old power plants with carbon capture capability
than in newly designed plants.

A later study summarized the results of two earlier techno-economic
analyses on the same 450 MW power plant conducted in 2001 and 2006
for two different MEA-scrubbing solutions used for CO2 removal [195].
The results show that the concentration of the MEA solutions used for

capture has a significant impact on both the cost and energy penalty,
such that the overall cost of CO2 capture is estimated to decrease more
than 32% going from 20% MEA solution to 30% MEA solution, while the
energy penalty for capture decreases 27%, respectively.

Many  of  the  amine  solutions  also  pose  technical  challenges,
including relatively low solubilities and hence capacities for CO2, which
necessitate the use of large absorbers and hence high cost. In addition,
amines  that  are  vaporized  from  the  solution  or  emitted  from  post-
combustion carbon capture operation may undergo photo-oxidation in
the  atmosphere  [200],  where  the  products  of  oxidative  and  thermal
degradation of amines pose further problems for the environment [201,
202]. Particularly,  many of the degradation products such as nitrosa-
mines and nitramines that may form by reaction of amines with SO2,
NO2  and O2  in the flue gas are known carcinogens, and pose potential
harm  to  human  health.  Degradation  products  also  lead  to  corrosion
problems in the process equipment and piping. Advanced amines like
piperazine  and  ethyldiethanolamine  are  chemically  more  stable  and
more resistant to degradation than conventional amines, but they are
also more expensive, and more vulnerable to interactions with other flue
gas components such as SO2, NOx and fly ash, requiring pretreatment to
remove  these  contaminants  from  the  flue  gas  prior  to  the  absorption
step.

Mixtures of amines in polyethylene glycol (PEG) are also explored
[203]. PEG has low vapor pressure and almost half the heat capacity of
water,  which  leads  to  lower  energy  penalty  during  regeneration  and
significantly less corrosion. However, most of these mixtures have Tmax
◦
C  that  lead  to  onset  of  undesirable  weight  loss  at
values  around  90
temperatures  significantly  lower  than  other  amine  solutions  (see
Table 9), and pose challenges for CO2  capture at higher temperatures.
Alternative pathways to reduce the energy burden of the regeneration
step include augmentation with solar thermal energy integrated into the
CO2  capture  process  [204],  and  replacing  thermal  regeneration  with
capacitive  deionization  (CDI),  where  charged  dissolved  ions  in  the
amine solution depicted in Eqn. (2) through Eqn. (5) are collected after
electrosorption  on  the  anode  and  cathode  surfaces  by  means  of  an
externally imposed potential, and the regenerated ion-free amine solu-
tion is then fed back to the CO2  absorber, resulting in overall energy
savings of 10% to 45% [205].

5.1.1.2. CO2  capture  in  ammonia-based  solutions. In  an  attempt  to
overcome or bypass some of the technical drawbacks and deficiencies of
amine-based  scrubbing,  absorbents  other  than  amines  have  also been
investigated  for  CO2  capture.  One  of  these  is  the  “chilled”  ammonia
process, where the flue gas reacts with the aqueous ammonia solution in
a wet scrubber to form ammonium bicarbonate (NH4HCO3) or ammo-
nium  carbonate  ((NH4)2CO3).  Although  the  regeneration  of  the
ammonia solution requires heat input in order to thermally decompose
ammonium bicarbonate or carbonate, it was reported that the aqueous
ammonia process is significantly more energy efficient and requires up
to 60% less energy than the MEA scrubbing process [206]. Likewise, the
total energy requirement for ammonia-based CO2 capture was estimated
to  be  1147 kJ/kgCO2  compared  to  a  much  higher  penalty  of
4215 kJ/kgCO2  for  a  MEA-based  capture  process  using  30wt%  MEA
solution [207]. Prior to scrubbing, the flue gas undergoes pretreatment
in order to oxidize the NO and SO2 impurities to NO2 and SO3, respec-
tively. Correspondingly, the other by-products of scrubbing are usually
ammonium  sulfate  ((NH4)2SO4)  and  nitrate  ((NH4NO3),  which  are
valuable chemicals used also as fertilizers.

Similarly, a modified Solvay process was proposed [208] that em-
ploys a dual-alkali approach using ammonia to catalyze the CO2 reaction
with sodium chloride to form and precipitate sodium bicarbonate by the
reaction,

CO2 + NaCl + NH3 + H2O = NaHCO3 + NH4Cl

(6)

During  the  regeneration  step,  ammonia  is  recovered  by  reacting

ammonium chloride with lime.

2NH4Cl + Ca(OH)2 = 2NH3 + CaCl2 + 2H2O

(7)

Lime is produced from limestone by the calcination reaction followed by
hydration,

CaCO3 = CaO + CO2

CaO + H2O = Ca(OH)2

(8)

(9)

Thus the overall reaction for the dual-alkali process is,

CO2 + 2NaCl + CaCO3 + H2O = 2NaHCO3 + CaCl2

(10)

In this dual-alkali process, ammonium serves as the primary alkali
and lime as the secondary alkali. The precipitated sodium bicarbonate
can be collected, and then heated to form sodium carbonate (Na2CO3).
Despite its simplicity and low cost for ammonia, this process has also
drawbacks. It is energy intensive, partly due to the heat requirement for
calcination of the limestone, which serves as the secondary alkali. Also,
for every two moles of CO2 removed from the flue stream, one mole of
CO2  is  released  back  to  the  atmosphere  during  the  calcination  of
limestone.

Similar  to  amines,  ammonia  based  CO2  capture  also  has  two
important  drawbacks,  one  due  to  huge  energy  consumption,  and  the
other due to its large carbon footprint, both of which has to do with the
upstream production of ammonia in the first place. Ammonia, as one of
the largest quantity chemicals in the world (230 million metric tons in
2018), is produced commercially via the Haber-Bosch process that in-
volves steam reforming of methane to produce the hydrogen needed to
react with nitrogen under high pressure (typically 10 to 25 MPa) and
◦
elevated  temperatures  (350  to  550
C)  over  a  Fe-based  catalyst.  This
process  not only consumes nearly 1%  of the world’s  energy, but also
produces copious amounts of emissions up to 1.87 kgCO2/kgNH3 [194].
Furthermore, it is estimated that nearly 40% of the fertilizer nitrogen,
which is directly derived from ammonia, is lost to the environment and
into the atmosphere - as dinitrogen and NOx [209]. This loss of fertilizer
represents  not  only  a  significant  waste  of  energy,  but  also  adverse
environmental impact of the reactive nitrogen species in the atmosphere
as well as in the waterways seeping into the food supply chain. On the up
side, the byproducts of ammonia absorption typically include NH4CO3,
NH4NO3,  and  (NH4)2SO4,  which  can  all  be  used  as  fertilizers.  These
upstream  and  downstream  considerations  are  important  for  compre-
hensive  assessment  and  selection  of  the  suitable  CO2  capture
technology.

Due to their non-volatility, low corrosivity, and non-toxicity, sodium
carbonate-bicarbonate slurries were also explored for CO2 capture from
coal-fired power plants and the energy requirement for regeneration was
estimated to be 3.22 MJ/kgCO2 as opposed to a higher energy penalty of
3.8 MJ/kgCO2  for  the  MEA-based  capture  process  [210].  Although
environmentally friendly, sodium carbonate-based capture exhibit low
absorption rates compared to many of the amine-based solutions, and
require larger scrubbers with greater contact areas.

5.2.1. Capture by physical absorption

Capture by physical absorption does not involve chemical reaction
but instead dissolution of CO2 in the solvent. In principle, the limitation
for physical absorption of any gas in a liquid is governed by Henry’s law,
which simply states that at constant temperature, the concentration, ci,
of a particular gas, i, dissolved in a unit volume of liquid is related to its
partial pressure, pi, in equilibrium with that liquid. At infinite dilution,
this can be expressed by

Pi = kH.Ci

(11)

Here,  kH  represents  Henry’s  constant.  For  CO2  dissolved  in  water  at
room temperature, kH = 3.44 mol/m3 MPa. It is clear from Eqn. (11) that
the capacity of the solvent is limited by the CO2  partial pressure, and

thus higher pressures favor higher dissolved gas content. This poses a
challenge for CO2 capture from the flue gas streams of fossil fuel power
plants, where the concentration of CO2  is rather low, typically 10% to
15% for coal-fired and 3% to 5% for natural gas power plants. On the
other  hand,  CO2  capture  by  physical  absorption  from  flue  streams  of
IGCC plants looks more attractive due to the significantly higher con-
centrations of CO2.

As the solubility of gasses in liquids usually decreases with increasing
temperature, effective separation of CO2 by physical absorption in liquid
solvents involves operation at reduced temperatures and high pressures
in order to achieve higher concentrations of dissolved CO2. This is fol-
lowed by a desorption step at reduced pressure and/or increased tem-
perature, where CO2  is released and collected from the liquid solvent.
Several commercial processes based on physical absorption are available
for industrial scale separation and capture of CO2 and other impurities
from flue streams as tabulated in Table 10. Selexsol process is preferred
for the removal acid gasses (CO2 and H2S), and offers several advantages
including low vapor pressure, low toxicity and low corrosion activity.
Similarly, the primary solvent methanol for Rectisol process is stable and
less  corrosive.  Both Selexsol  and Rectisol  are commercially  employed
not only for CO2 separation but also for H2S capture from flue streams.
However, both are energy intensive due to the thermal requirements of
the absorption and desorption steps. By contrast, Purisol process offers
lower  energy  consumption,  while  Morphysorb  process  offers  30%  to
40% reduction in operating costs compared to Selexsol [184]. The high
solubility of CO2 in polypropylene carbonate renders the Fluor process
attractive for capture, while the weaker bonding between the solvent
and CO2 allows easy separation at reduced pressure [186].

Although  CO2  capture  via  physical  absorption  processes  generally
requires less energy for CO2 release and solvent regeneration steps, they
are severely limited by uptake capacity and their operating temperature
regime.  Cooling  the  flue  gas  stream  down  to  ambient  temperature  is
generally  required  prior  to  the  absorption  step  to  capture  CO2  in  the
solvent. This adversely impacts the thermal efficiency of the process. For
these and other reasons including the lack of a regulatory or financial
penalty (or, price) on carbon emissions, physical absorption technolo-
gies have not yet received wide scale attention for CO2  capture at the
industrial  scale.  There  is  need  for  developing  better  and  more  stable
solvents with higher solubility for CO2 at higher temperatures than those
available today.

5.2.1.1. Capture  in  fluorinated  solvents. Perfluorinated  compounds
(PFC) offer high stability due to the strong C-F bonds in their molecular
structure, and consequently, have moderate vapor pressures and high
boiling points. They also exhibit low molecular interactions due to the
repulsive nature of the fluorine atoms in the structure and have negli-
gibly small dipole moments. These attributes provide high solubility for
CO2 during absorption, as well as a low energy barrier to release the CO2
during the solvent regeneration step at reduced pressures or increased
temperatures.

In an earlier study [185] reported by the National Energy Technol-
ogy Laboratory (NETL) of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for the
removal of CO2 by wet scrubbing of flue gasses from large point sources
such  as  power  plants,  several  different  types  of  PFCs  have  been

(C14F24),

investigated for their CO2  solubility, stability and uptake rates over a
wide pressure and temperature regime. The compounds included per-
perfluoroperhydrophenanthrene
fluoroperhydrofluorene
(C17F30), and perfluorocyclomethyldecalin (C13F22), known respectively
as PP10, PP11, and PP25. The results indicated that CO2 is up to 7 times
more soluble than N2 in all the three PFCs tested, and found them to be
stable  and  reliable  solvents  for  selective  capture  of  CO2  from  flue
◦
streams  at  temperatures  up  to  227
C  and  pressures  up  to  3 MPa.
Nevertheless, solvent loss by evaporation, relatively low mass transfer
coefficients for the gasses in PFCs, as well as the decrease in the gas/-
liquid  interfacial  area  with  increasing  viscosity  pose  technical  chal-
lenges for the use of PFCs for effective carbon capture.

5.2.1.2. Capture in ionic liquids. Ionic liquids (IL) are considered viable
alternatives  to  amine-based  solvents  for  CO2  capture,  and  generally
exhibit exceptional chemical and thermal stability, negligibly low vapor
pressure, non-flammability, recyclability, high polarity, high viscosity,
and low toxicity [211–213]. For these reasons, ionic liquids have gained
interest in the last two decades for a wide range of applications. These
include  solvents  for  gas  separation,  electrolytes  for  batteries,  super-
capacitors and other electrochemical devices [214], or inert solvents for
catalysis [215].

Ionic  liquids  constitute  an  extremely  rich  class  of  high  molecular
weight  organic  salts  most  of  which  have  melting  points  near  room
temperature and contain an organic cation, and either an inorganic or an
organic anion. Some of the more commonly employed anions and cat-
ions are given in Fig. 26. The number of possible IL compositions is quite
large, and the properties of ILs largely depend upon the choice of anions
and  cations.  So  tuning  the  properties  of  ILs  to  obtain  enhanced  CO2

solubility for effective capture is an important technical challenge, but at
the same time an attractive opportunity for CO2  separation by absorp-
tion  in  ILs  [185,217],  and  by  IL-supported  and  facilitated  transport
membranes [218].

Results of experimental work using various spectroscopies as well as
theoretical  studies  using  molecular  simulations  are  in  good  general
agreement that interactions between CO2  and the anion moiety of the
ionic compound dominate the extent of solubility of CO2 in ILs, while the
cation  plays  more  of  a  secondary  role  [216,217].  This  interaction  is
described as of Lewis acid-base type, where the anion serves as the Lewis
base  and  CO2  acts  as  the  Lewis  acid.  Longer  cation  alkyl  side  chain
lengths  seem  to  increase  CO2  solubility  by  decreasing  the  extent  of
cation-anion  interactions  and  possibly  increasing  the  free  volume  for
CO2 in the solvent. Furthermore, there is evidence that, especially in the
case of imidazolium-based ILs, no significant difference exists for CO2
solubility  in ILs with hydrogen-  versus methyl-terminated anion, sug-
gesting that CO2-anion interactions cannot alone explain CO2 solubility
in ILs, and other factors may be in play [217]. These secondary factors
may involve the free volume mechanism, where CO2 molecules reside in
the free spaces or cavities in liquid, and also entropic effects, and mo-
lecular interactions such as electrostatic, hydrogen bonding and van der
Waals  forces  between  the  species  in  the  liquid  phase.  Computational
studies also indicated that attractive van der Waals forces dominate the
solubility of CO2, and electrostatic interactions has a secondary influ-
ence on the excess enthalpy of dissolution while hydrogen bonding did
not seem to have a significant impact [219]. Based on these findings, this
study  further  investigated  the  impact  of  increased  van  der  Waals  in-
teractions using highly brominated large anions such as 1-ethyl-3-me-
thylimidazolium hexabromophosphate (i.e., [emim][PBr6]) that led to
enhanced solubility of CO2. Contrary to the claims of solvent-solute in-
teractions governing solubility, others have suggested that entropic ef-
fects dominate CO2  solubility in ionic liquids [220]. This conclusion is
supported  by  the  observed  increase  in  CO2  solubility  with  increasing
molecular  weight,  free  volume,  and  molar  volume  of  the  ionic liquid

requires further investigation of this interesting class of organic salts.

Among the vast variety of IL compositions, imidazolium-based ionic
liquids attracted arguably the most attention due to their remarkably
◦
high solubility for CO2 [216,217,221]. The solubility of CO2 at 25
C in
several  imidazolium-based  ionic  liquid  compositions  is  presented  in
Fig.  27.  The  observed  difference  between  hydrogen-  and
◦
methyl-substituted ILs in the temperature range 10 to 50
C suggests this
substitution may influence the CO2-cation interactions. For all temper-
atures tested, ionic liquids with the [Tf2N] anion exhibited the highest
CO2  solubility [217]. Similarly, ionic liquids based on the cation trie-
thylenetetramine  (TETA)  with  suitable  anions,  such  as  with  tetra-
floroborate, i.e., (TETAH)
exhibits a CO2 absorption capacity of
0.96 molCO2/molIL at room temperature while addition of 40% water
improved the capacity to 2.04 molCO2/molIL [222]. Similarly, absorp-
tion capacity is shown to relate closely to the ionic structure, and for the
same  cation  has  followed  the  order  (NO3)  > (BF4)  > (SO4),  with  2
(TETAH)
containing  40%  water  exhibited  the  best  CO2  ca-
pacity [223]. However, these imidazolium- and amine-based ionic liq-
uids also have ammonia as the starting chemical in their production, and
suffer from similar disadvantages in life cycle considerations regarding
high  energy  penalties  and  large  carbon  footprints  of  ammonia,  as
pointed out in the previous sections of this article on CO2  capture by
chemical absorption.

For  all  gas  separation  applications,  selectivity  is  as  important  a
consideration as solubility. This is particularly true for CO2 capture from
power plants as well as sweetening of natural gas, as they are heavily
diluted with N2  and also contain other impurities. Hence, the relative
selectivity of CO2 especially with respect to N2 is most relevant for carbon
capture from flue gas streams. Fig. 28 represents relative solubilities of
various industrially important gasses in the ionic liquid [hmpy][Tf2N] (1-
n-hexyl-3-methylpyridinium  bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide),  and
hence the selectivity of CO2 with respect to other gaseous species. The
solubility of gasses in [hmpy][Tf2N] at room temperature increases in the
following order, N2<O2<CH4<C2H6<CO2<SO2 [216]. A similar trend is
observed also with other ILs. In general CO2  solubility is significantly
higher than for N2 (and CH4), which makes it attractive for these ionic
liquids to serve as physical solvents to capture CO2 from power plant flue
streams, and also for the sweetening of natural gas.

selectivity  for  separation  from  typical  flue  gas  compositions.  The  ordering  of
solubilities  follows  the  trend  N2<O2<CH4<C2H6<CO2<SO2  (in  the  inset).

Needless to say, the prospects of ionic liquids for CO2  capture ap-
plications  require  in  the  least  competitive,  if  not  superior,  attributes
when  compared  to  commercial  solvents  currently  available  for  this
purpose (see Table 10). Although ionic liquids generally possess superior
properties including extremely low vapor pressure and high selectivity
for CO2/N2  mixtures, more work is required to develop ILs with more
competitive properties than other currently available solvents. ILs are
also quite expensive and sell for ~$1000/kg [216]. Mass production is
expected to bring the price down to about $40/kg, but this is still 10 to
20 times more expensive than the commercially available solvents.

5.2. CO2  capture by solid sorbents

Compatibility between the high exit temperatures of flue gasses and
operational parameters of the CO2 capture process is highly desirable for
effective thermal management and increased process efficiency. Capture
by absorption in liquid solvents requires cooling of the flue gas stream
down to temperatures that are compatible with the chemical stability
and vapor pressure of the solvent used. By contrast, solid sorbents are
usually tolerant to and compatible with high temperatures of flue gasses
emitted  from  industrial  processes  and  power  plants,  chemically  ore
stable,  and  generally  less  expensive  than  liquid  solvents.  These  attri-
butes make solid sorbents attractive candidates for CO2 separation and
capture.

As  depicted  in  Fig.  30,  a  wide  variety  of  solid  sorbents  including
zeolites,  carbon-  and  calcium-based  sorbents,  organic-inorganic  com-
posites, and metal-organic framework structures have been investigated
for their CO2 sorptive properties and are reviewed in recent articles [39,
78,184,190,224,225].  In  general,  CO2  capture  by  solid  sorbents  pro-
ceeds  in  several  ways.  CO2  may  be  selectively  adsorbed  on  the  solid
surface (i.e., adsorption), it may chemically react with the solid to form a
stable carbonate (i.e., carbonization or mineralization – for storage), it
may diffuse into the pores of the solid (i.e., membrane separation), or its
diffusion in the solid is controlled by size selection rules (i.e., molecular
sieving). In selecting the proper solid sorbent, consideration for desir-
able attributes includes high CO2 sorption capacity, high selectivity for

which seem to be proportional to (viscosity)
permission from the American Chemical Society.

Another important consideration from a practical point of view is the
generally high viscosity of ionic liquids, which can range between 66
and  1100  cP  at  room  temperature  [186].  These  viscosity  values  are
significantly higher than most of the common solvents, which of course
adversely  impacts  interfacial  contact  between  the  gaseous  and  liquid
phases  during  absorption.  In  fact  many  ionic  liquids  can  form  highly
viscous gel-like  structures. Naturally, high viscosity is not a  desirable
property because it often limits mass transport of diffusing species, and
poses practical challenges for the separation process and construction
materials.  Fig.  29  depicts  the  relationship  between  the  self-diffusion
coefficient  of  CO2  in  various common solvents and  ionic liquids  with
their viscosities, and indicates significant reduction in diffusion coeffi-
cient with increasing viscosity. Fortunately, the properties of ionic liq-
uids can be tuned by the proper choice of anions and cations. Generally,
IL viscosity increases with the size of the anion, and also with the length

CO2, fast adsorption/desorption kinetics, ease of regeneration with low
energy requirement, operational temperature and pressures compatible
with  flue  gas  conditions,  high  recycling  stability,  and  chemical  and
thermal stability against and flue gas contaminants such as SOx, H2O,
HCl,  NOx,  and  Hg.  Unfortunately,  there  is  no  single  sorbent  that  em-
bodies majority of these attributes. Inevitably, there are always trade
offs.  On  the  other  hand,  materials  costs  for  most  solid  sorbents  are
usually  low.  Nevertheless,  it  is  estimated  that  the  cost  solid  sorbent
should  not  exceed  $10/kg  in  order  to  compete  favorably  with  liquid
solvents [190].

5.2.1. Capture by physical adsorption

The CO2  capture capacity by absorption in liquid solvents is gener-
ally limited by the liquid/gas interfacial contact area and rate of mass
transfer across this interface. To achieve significant capture capacities,
this constraint necessitates the use of large area absorption towers and
scrubbers.

Use of solid sorbents can overcome this limitation as solids with large
surface areas can be fabricated to maximize the gas/solid contact area
for  adsorption.  Moreover,  mass  transport  rates  (or,  diffusion  co-
efficients)  in  liquids  are  several  orders  of  magnitude  slower  than  in
gasses. Typically, diffusion coefficients for dissolved or ionized species
(cid:0) 9  m2/s, while in gasses the diffusion
in liquids are of the order of 10
(cid:0) 5 m2/s. This renders gas/solid interfacial
coefficients are generally ~10
rate processes to occur inherently faster and allows ready replenishment
of adsorption sites by CO2.

However, for solid sorbents to compete with amine-based CO2 cap-
ture, they need to offer capacities higher than the average MEA scrub-
bing  capacity  of  3  to  4  molCO2/kg  of  sorbent  [190].  Despite  the
significantly faster diffusion rates of CO2 in the micropores of the solid
sorbent, CO2  capture by adsorption is impacted by interference effects
particularly of water vapor and also by other gasses present in the flue
gas that compete for the same adsorption sites. CO2 adsorption involves
interaction with a free active site, *, on the surface of the solid sorbent,
and regeneration involves the desorption of CO2  from that active site,
freeing * for the next adsorption cycle according to the reactions

CO2(g) + * = (CO2)(ads)*(adsorption step)

(12)

(CO2)(ads)* = CO2(g) + *(desorption step)

(13)

Selective adsorption of CO2  (versus N2) on the sorbent material is
governed by the strength of van der Walls interaction between the polar
surface sites and the large quadrupole moment of the dipolar molecule

CO2  (4.30 D.A, or (cid:0) 14.27×10

moments, the difference in their polarizabilities also favors preferential

adsorption  of  CO2.  Summary  of  select  physicochemical  properties  of
various  gasses  typically  found  in  flue  gas  streams  are  compiled  and
presented in Table 11. The nature and extent of electrostatic interactions
of these gasses, and in particular N2 and CO2, with the sorbent surface
sites  not  only  affect  the  affinity  for  CO2  but  also  impacts  the  energy
requirements  for  the  capture and  regeneration  processes.  If  the  inter-
action is too strong, desorption becomes an energy intensive process. On
the other hand, while a weak interaction helps reduce energy demand
for regeneration, it also reduces CO2 selectivity.

There  are  several  key  requirements  for  sorbent  selection.  The
adsorption capacity of the  solid sorbent is a critical parameter  and is
determined primarily by two factors, namely the specific surface area
and the equilibrium adsorption isotherm, both of which in turn dictate
the required amount of sorbent and thus the size of the adsorption tower.
The higher the specific surface area, the higher the active surface site
population available for adsorption. Moreover fast adsorption/desorp-
tion  kinetics  is  desired  for  high  capture  throughput  and  fast  cycling
between  adsorption  and  desorption  steps.  High  selectivity  for  CO2
adsorption  versus  nitrogen  and  other  flue  gas  components  is  highly
desirable to obtain a concentrated CO2 product stream without the need
for further separation. It is also desirable for the solid sorbent to have a
low heat of adsorption, as this determines the heat requirement for the
sorbent regeneration step, which may be substantial. For example, the
heat for physisorption of gasses on solids usually ranges between (cid:0) 25 to
(cid:0) 50 kJ/mol,  while  for  chemisorption  the  range  is  between  (cid:0) 60  to
(cid:0) 90 kJ/mol [190]. Between regeneration and adsorption cycles, which
are typically carried out under different temperature and pressure re-
gimes, the sorbent is also required to exhibit good chemical, thermal and
mechanical
the
adsorption-regeneration cycles, the adsorbed CO2 can be removed from
the solid sorbent mainly in two ways, either by cycling the pressure, as in
pressure swing adsorption (PSA) and vacuum swing adsorption (VSA),
or by cycling the temperature as in temperature swing adsorption (TSA).
These  processes  usually  require  two  towers  operating  in  tandem,
each tower switching between adsorption and regeneration cycles out of
phase  in  time  with  the  other  tower.  During  the  sorbent  regeneration
step,  the  captured  CO2  is  recovered.  The  regenerated  sorbent  is  then
exposed to the flue gas for the next cycle of adsorption. Hence, the flue
gas flow is switched between these two towers. In PSA, CO2 from the flue
gas  is  preferentially  adsorbed  on  the  solid  sorbent  at  high  pressures
during  the  adsorption  step,  and  released  from  the  sorbent  during  the
regeneration step at low pressure, or under vacuum (VSA) [225,227].

PSA is a commercial technology for CO2 capture from power plants, with
efficiencies in excess of 85% [162]. In TSA, heating the sorbent tower
with  hot  air  or  steam  regenerates  the  solid  sorbent,  whereby  the
adsorbed  CO2  is  released  from  the  sorbent  surface  and  recovered  for
capture. Although the regeneration time for TSA is typically longer than
for PSA, the purity of the captured CO2 can be higher (> 95%) while CO2
recovery from the flue gas can exceed 80% [228]. A techno-economic
analysis  reported  that  the  operating  cost  for  TSA  for  direct  capture
from air was estimated to be around $80 to 150/ton of CO2 [229].

A  vast  variety  of  porous  solids  have  been  explored  towards  CO2
capture  purposes.  Typical  CO2  sorption  capacities  and  operating  con-
ditions  for  many  of  these  solid  sorbents  [184]  are  summarized  in
Table 12. It is clear from the table that in general, the adsorption ca-
pacities of most solid sorbents at ambient conditions are well below the
average CO2 capture capacities of 3 to 4 molCO2/kg of sorbent for liquid
solvents such as MEA (see Section 5.1.1. Chemical absorption - above).
Comparatively  low  CO2  selectivity  and  uptake  capacity  are  major
drawbacks for most of the untreated solid sorbents. To further improve
their  adsorption  properties,  various  pretreatment  strategies  including
surface modification by amines for imparting chemical functionality at
the solid surface or by impregnation of CO2-active liquid sorbents such
as  amines  into  the  pores  of  solid  sorbents  have  been  applied  to  pro-
spective  sorbents.  Similarly,  solid-liquid  and  solid-polymer  composite
sorbents are explored for improved CO2 capacity and selectivity.

Although carbon-based sorbents has relatively higher capacities than
silica-based sorbents, they demand high pressures and low temperatures
for increased capacity. Silica-based sorbents, on the other hand, offer
surface modification more readily than carbon-based sorbents because
of their high concentration of surface-OH groups that facilitate chemical
modifications to or functionalization of the silica surface to enhance CO2
adsorption.  Indeed,  surface  modification  or  impregnation  of  porous
solid  sorbents  with  amine-based  chemicals  such  as  polyethylenimine
(PEI), diethenolamine, (DEA), and tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA) have
resulted in improved CO2 capacities [184]. Also, CO2 uptake capacity of
5.39 molCO2/kg of as-synthesized mesoporous silica (MCM-41) sorbent
impregnated  with  TEPA  has  been  reported  [230].  The  basis  for  such
improvement  is  the  enhanced  interaction  between  the  CO2,  which  is
acidic, and the active amine site on the modified sorbent surface, which
is basic in character. Enhanced adsorption is facilitated by the covalent
bond formation between the amine site and the adsorbed CO2. Similarly,
alkali-metal  or  alkaline-earth  oxides  can  be  employed  for  surface
modification and improved capacity by providing active surface sites of
basic character that enhances CO2 adsorption. Activated carbon is one of
the cheapest, oldest and most widely used solid adsorbents for industrial
applications, and is also considered for CO2 capture from power plants
[231]. It has high thermal, mechanical and chemical stability, and ex-
hibits low sensitivity for water vapor, which otherwise competes with
CO2 adsorption with adverse impact on capacity. However, CO2 is only
weakly adsorbed on carbonaceous sorbents, resulting in poor selectivity
and low capacity. These shortcomings are mitigated by using advanced
processing  techniques  that  greatly  improve  surface  area  and  pore
structure  by  nanostructuring  of  the  carbon  sorbent,  or  by  doping  or
decoration  to  increase  the  alkalinity  of  surface  sites  to  enhance  CO2
uptake capacity [232] It is well known that processing, nanostructuring,
functionalization  and  doping  play  important  roles  in  designing
advanced functional materials with superior properties [233,234]. This
approach is reflected in the high adsorption capacities for single-walled
carbon  nanotubes  and  graphene  oxide  [235]  for  CO2  adsorption  in
Table  12,  where  the  latter  exhibits  a  capacity  of  7.95  molCO2/kg  of
sorbent. The table also points to the strong influence of temperature on
capacity.  As  the  heats  of  adsorption  for  most  gasses  on  solid  are
exothermic, it is to be expected that lowering the adsorption tempera-
ture improve their CO2 uptake capacity. Indeed, adsorption isotherms of
CO2  on activated carbon illustrates this trend clearly in Fig. 31, where
higher CO2 capacities are obtained at lower temperatures. Investigations
on various forms of nanostructured and mesoporous carbons indicated

Fig.  31. CO2  adsorption  isotherms  on  activated  carbon  measured  at  various
temperatures. Reprinted from [190].

that  water  vapor  preferentially  adsorbs  on  oxygen  containing  surface
sites or functional groups on carbons, and this adversely impacts CO2
sorption  capacity  [236,237].  By  contrast,  surface  modification  or
decoration  by  amine  solutions  improves  CO2  adsorption  capacity  by
providing surface sites that are of basic character. Indeed, the capacity of
coke-derived  activated  carbon  impregnated  with  diethanolamine  was
reported to be 5.63 molCO2/kg of adsorbent [238].

Zeolites represent another important family of solid sorbents that are
used in many industrial applications. Zeolites may occur naturally or can
be  made  synthetically.  They  have  microporous  structures  based  on  a
silicate framework with well-defined and uniform pores whose size may
vary typically from 0.5 nm to 1.2 nm [239]. Substitution by Al for Si sites
in the framework structure imparts a negative charge that is compen-
sated  by  an  alkali  or  alkaline-earth  cation.  The  cations  can  be
ion-exchanged to tune the pore size within the framework, which allows
gas separation by molecular sieving. Affinity to CO2  adsorption is also
contributed by its large quadrupole that gives rise to strong electrostatic
interaction  with  the  cation  sites.  Nevertheless,  as  the  gas  separation
mechanism is largely provided by size selection, detailed discussion of
zeolites are provided below in Section 5.2.3.1.

5.2.2. Capture by chemical reaction

Capture  by  chemical  reaction  exploits  the  base-acid  interactions
between the acidic character of CO2 and the basic character of alkali- or
alkaline  earth  metal  oxides  or  carbonates.  Use  of  amines  for  surface
modification  or  impregnation  of  solid  sorbents  similarly  serves  the
purpose  of  enhancing  the  basic  character  of  surface  sites.  Chemical
capture of CO2  from flue gasses using alkali metal carbonates (M2CO3,
where M: Li, Na, K) [240] can be expressed by the carbonation reaction,

M2CO3 + H2O + CO2 = 2 MHCO3

(14)

The enthalpy for the carbonation reaction is (cid:0) 135 kJ/mol for M = Na,
and (cid:0) 141 kJ/mol for M = K. CO2 uptake is accomplished in the presence
of steam, where CO2  and steam react with the alkali metal carbonate
◦
sorbent at 60 to 110
C and form an alkali metal bicarbonate as indicated
in reaction (14). The corresponding reaction for the regeneration (or,
decarbonation) of the solid sorbent can be expressed by,

2 MHCO3 = M2CO3 + H2O + CO2

(15)

◦
The regeneration step involves heating the bicarbonate at 100 to 200
C
during  which  the  CO2  is  released  and  captured.  The  theoretical  CO2
capacities for Na2CO3 and K2CO3 are 9.43 molCO2/kg and 7.23 molCO2/

kg  of  sorbent,  respectively.  These  values  are  more  than  2  to  3  times
higher than for sorbents that capture by physisorption. However in re-
ality, only a portion of the sorbent is actively utilized for CO2  uptake.
Indeed, most studies reported capacities ranging roughly between 1 and
3  molCO2/kg  of  either  Na2CO3  or  K2CO3  supported  on  various  solid
supports including activated carbon, porous Al2O3, silica gel, TiO2, and
ZrO2  [190]. The results demonstrate the role of bulk diffusion limita-
tions of the carbonation reaction, and despite the dispersion of the active
sorbent on solid supports, that only a fraction of the sorbent mass can
actively be utilized for CO2 capture. This limitation is one of the draw-
backs of chemical capture by solid sorbents.

5.2.2.1. Capture on oxides  and minerals. Capturing of CO2  by reacting
with  alkaline  earth  oxides  or  carbonates  such  as  calcite  (CaCO3)  or
dolomite (CaCO3.MgCO3) have long been used for sweetening of natural
gas and other flue streams for the removal of CO2 and sulfurous species
H2S  and  SO2  [241].  This  approach  potentially  lends  itself  to  calcium
looping process (CLP) at high temperatures compatible with power plant
flue gas streams [242]. Although these sorbents are cheap and abundant,
they suffer from loss of more than half of their capture capacity during
repeated carbonation-decarbonation cycles. Moreover, the rate of CO2
uptake  and  CO2  capacity  of  the  solid  is  severely  hindered  by  mass
transport effects inside the bulk. This limits the usable capacity of these
cheap  and  abundant  materials  as  an  effective  CO2  sorbents.  Doping
strategies to create lattice defects inside the crystal help enhance mass
transport rates  in the  solid sorbent. Many of  the issues  related to the
fundamental aspects of the capacity decay in the calcium-based sorbents
are reviewed recently, where hydration during or after the calcination (i.
e., decarbonation) step is proposed to reduce the loss in capacity [243].
Other oxides were also investigated for post-combustion CO2 capture
in a similar looping process. As an example, zirconates (Li2ZrO3) and
silicates (Li4SiO4) of lithium such are reported to show promise for high
CO2  sorption capacity at elevated temperatures, where the capture re-
action can be expressed as,

Li2ZrO3(s) + CO2(g) = Li2CO3(s) + ZrO2(s)

(16)

Depending  on  the  CO2  content  of  the  flue  gas,  reaction  (16)  offers
◦
reversibility within the temperature range of 450 to 590
C [78]. This
allows  improved  thermal  management  during  switching  between  the
capture and regeneration cycles simply by swinging the temperature in a
narrow window to reverse the reaction direction. Addition of other al-
kali metal oxides or carbonates such as K2CO3 also help improve the CO2
uptake rate and capacity by forming binary or ternary eutectic compo-
sitions on the surface of the zirconate particles, whereby accelerating the
absorption of CO2 in this molten carbonate film [244]. This is depicted

in Fig. 32, where K2CO3  exhibits the highest capacity for CO2  capture
among the other alkali metal carbonates.

Interestingly, lithium silicate exhibits higher CO2  capacity than its
zirconate counterpart, and up to 10 times the capacity with respect to
other  oxides,  while  offering  rapid  adsorption  kinetics,  stability,  and
operation in  a  wide range of  elevated temperatures and  flue  gas CO2
concentrations [245]. The overall chemical reaction for CO2 capture is

Li4SiO4(s) + CO2(g) = Li2SiO3(s) + Li2CO3(s)

(17)

◦
The lithium silicate reacts with CO2  below 720
C to form Li2CO3,
◦
and  then  releases  the  CO2  when  heated  above  720
C.  This  narrow
temperature  window  offers  great  thermal  advantage,  and  is  arguably
one  of  the  highest  operating  regimes  for  solid  capture  including  mo-
lecular  sieves,  membranes,  and  metal-organic  frameworks  structures.
Naturally, these attributes potentially make Li4SiO4  a viable option of
post-combustion  CO2  capture  by  carbonization.  However,  the  overall
rate of CO2  uptake, which exhibits first order kinetics with respect to
CO2  partial  pressure,  seems  to  be  controlled  by  a  highly  activated
(~120 kJ/mol) and sluggish surface reaction [246].

5.2.3. Capture by molecular sieving

Separation by molecular sieving is achieved by framework solids that
have crystal structures with sufficiently large open channels or pores of
the order of nanometers in size that are compatible with molecular di-
ameters  of  gasses.  Depending  upon  the  type  and  composition  of  the
framework  solid  structure,  these  channels  selectively  allow  size-
compatible  gas  molecules  to  pass  through  but  not  others.  Transport
mechanism through these solids is generally via Knudsen diffusion.

In many solids of this category, not only the size but also the shape of
the channel is important and permits shape selective catalysis [247]. An
important
is  the  commercial

alysts to convert methanol to gasoline.

5.2.3.1. Capture on zeolites. Zeolites are a rich class of materials, mostly
made  of  crystalline  aluminosilicates,  where  the  framework  crystal
structure is built on the periodic arrangement of SiO4  and AlO4  tetra-
hedra with well-define molecular size pores or channels, as illustrated in
Fig. 33. The framework structure is negatively charged due to the dif-
+3 ions. This negative
ference between the oxidation states of Si
charge  is  compensated by  the positive  charge of  exchangeable alkali-
metal or alkaline-earth cations located in the pore spaces.

+4 and Al

Gas separation by zeolites depends on several factors but is governed
largely by the structure and composition of the zeolite, the nature and
size of structural cations located in the pores, and the size, shape and
polarity of the individual gas molecules. The alkali cation sites that are
basic in character are primarily responsible for facilitating adsorption of

the acidic CO2  molecule. Because of the larger quadrupole moment of

(cid:0) 40C.m2) compared to N2  ((cid:0) 4.65×10
CO2  ((cid:0) 14.27×10
there is also an electrostatic contribution due to stronger interaction of
CO2 with the structural cations in the pores of the zeolite framework that
favors adsorption. Hence relative polarizabilities of CO2  and N2  play a
role in effective separation, i.e., its selectivity.

There are more than 170 unique zeolite topologies whose structures
have been approved by the Structure Commission of the International
Zeolite  Association  (IZA-SC)  [250]. Because  of  the  vastness  of  zeolite
compositions and structures, only the salient features of CO2 adsorption
on these materials are discussed below. For more details the reader is
referred to the vast literature and review papers on zeolite structures as
well as the IZA web site [225,250–255].

Some  of  the  common  features  of  zeolites  are:  (a)  they  have
exchangeable  (usually,  alkali  metal)  cations  residing  inside  the  pores
that can be tuned for enhanced catalysis or CO2 capture, (b) these cat-
ions, when exchanged with hydrogen (i.e., H
) provides strongly acidic
sites for catalysis but not for CO2 capture, (c) they have pores or chan-
nels  that  are  generally  less  that  1 nm,  which  is  compatible  with  the
effective kinetic diameters respectively, of 0.33 nm and 0.36 nm for the
CO2 and N2 molecules inside the zeolite pores [254], and (d) these pores
may  have  one  or  more  discreet  sizes  depending  on  the  type  of  alkali
cation  present.  The  last  two  features  are  critical  for  size  selection
capability because they may allow separation by molecular sieving.

+

Monovalent cations are typically large, so they tend to block a large
section of the pore cross-sectional area and reduce the pore size to below
0.4 nm,  which  limits  passage  to  only  small  molecules,  while  alkaline
earth  or  other  divalent  cations  occupy  every  other  cation  position
leaving some pores available for gas transport of larger molecules. Be-
sides  capacity,  the  rate  of  CO2  uptake  is  operationally  a  critical
parameter, and this is dominated by diffusion through the micropores of
the zeolite crystal framework. Due to its larger kinetic diameter, diffu-
sion  of  N2  to  access  adsorption  sites  inside  the  smaller  micropores  is
comparatively restricted and hinders N2 uptake in the zeolite structure.
Adsorption isotherms provide a measure of the CO2  adsorption ca-
pacities of zeolites as illustrated in Fig. 34 for a variety of commercially
available zeolite compositions as a function CO2 pressure. As expected,
adsorption  capacity  increases  with  increasing  pressure.  Composition
also plays an important role even within the same family. Indeed, the

nature  and  size  of  the  cations  are  important  considerations  as  they
impact the pore size and acid-base properties for the CO2 adsorption site.
For example, CO2  capacities for ion exchanged NaX and NaY zeolites
indicated higher capacity with decreasing cationic radius in the order
Cs
, such that at ambient conditions of tempera-
ture and pressure, CO2 capacities of Li

Comparative  sorption  capacities  of  CO2  and  N2  as  well  as  the
resulting separation factors for several zeolite families are summarized
in Table  13. Although most compositions  exhibit high selectivity, the
uptake values indicate modest sorption capacities in the range of 2 to 4
molCO2/kg  of  zeolite,  barely  competitive  with  amine-based  sorbents
discussed above. Nevertheless, many zeolite families both synthetic and
naturally occurring have been developed commercially for multitude of
industrial  applications.  For  example,  zeolite  13X  was  successfully
employed for both VSA [225] and PSA applications, where in the latter
13X was shown to recover 99% pure CO2 from 53% of the CO2 from low
CO2-content  (16%  CO2  balance  N2)  flue  gas  and  70%  from  high--
CO2-content (26% CO2  balance N2) gas mixtures [256]. Depending on
type, the synthesis of zeolites can be process-intensive and costly, but the
raw  materials  are  usually  inexpensive.  However,  zeolites  are  usually
hydrophilic  and  show  preference  for  H2O  over  CO2.  This  makes
capturing CO2 from moist environments or flue gasses quite challenging.
The primary advantage of zeolites is their ability to tune the composition
and tailor towards specific properties. The strong interaction between
the adsorbed CO2 and the cation site that is responsible for the high CO2
uptake  capacity,  at  the  same  time,  hinders  the  release  of  CO2  during
cycling and regeneration. By choosing the right cation substitution, one
can reduce electrostatic interactions between the adsorbed CO2 and the
cation and mitigate this problem, but this comes at the expense of lower
CO2 uptake capacities.

5.2.3.2. Capture  on  metal  organic  frameworks  (MOF). Metal-organic
framework  (MOF)  structures  [257,258]  have  gained  interest  as  a
promising class of new materials with potential applications in catalysis
[259,260], hydrogen and methane storage, CO2 capture [183,261], and
gas separation [262,263]. However, they are yet to be demonstrated for
CO2 capture at pilot scale [264]. MOFs are made of two types of building
units,  namely,  a  transition  metal  ion  or  a  cluster  of  ions  and  organic
linkers that connect them. Flexibility in changing these building units
allows  modification  and  tuning  of  the  structural  and  functional

properties of MOFs. The building units form three-dimensional organ-
ic-inorganic hybrid networks via multiple links between transition metal
ions such as Cu and Zn and organic ligands including a variety of car-
boxylates, azolates and phosphonates. The structure and shape of the
metal-organic assembly is governed largely by the nature of metal ions
and organic ligands, and how they are linked together in the framework
structure. The length of the organic ligand affects the accessible surface
area and hence the porosity, which increases the accessible adsorption
sites and improves adsorption capacity. However, long ligands result in
structurally more fragile MOFs.

The framework structure allows MOFs to form a wide variety (more
than 20,000) of topologically diverse structures, functional groups, pore
sizes  and  porosities.  The  cartoon  of  a  MOF  structure  is  illustrated  in
Fig. 35, where the large yellow sphere in the center represents the void
space, or the pore. Accordingly, MOFs are highly porous materials with
pores  up  to  9.8 nm  and  densities  down  to  0.13 g/cm3  [2560]. Indeed
very large specific surface areas up to 10,000 m2/g of MOF can be ob-
tained  [265].  Such  extraordinarily  high  surface  areas  and  chemically
adjustable pore sizes allow tunable internal surface functionalities and
properties  that  provide  potential  for  a  wide  range  of  applications
including  CO2  capture.  The  heat  of  adsorption  of  CO2  for  MOFs  is
generally low and comparable to those for zeolites. Values in the range
of (cid:0) 30 to (cid:0) 45 kJ/mol for MIL-53 (Al, Cr) from 0.1 to 0.4 MPa pressure,
and  (cid:0) 30 kJ/mol  for  USO-1-A1  from  0  to  0.04 MPa  pressure  were  re-
ported [224]. The metal-organic framework composition MOF-5 is one
of the very first synthesized and widely studied cubic framework group
of  MOFs  with  the  formula  [Zn4O(BDC)3]•(DMF)8(C6H5Cl),  where
BDC=1,4-benzenedicarboxylate,  and  DMF=N,N’-dimethylformamide.
Many  other  MOF  structures  and  compositions  have  been  synthesized
and investigated for CO2 adsorption since then [183,258,262,266–268].
The  adsorption  capacities  of  several  MOF  types  measured  mostly  by
thermogravimetric  analysis  (TGA)  are  presented  in  Fig.  36.  The  iso-
therms conform to a Langmuir-type shape, where the best performance
was obtained with MOF-177 above 1.5 MPa pressure. At lower pressures
of  0.1 MPa,  MOF-74, MOF-505, and Cu3(BTC)2  show  the highest  CO2
capacities  among  the  nine  MOFs  presented  in  the  figure.  However,
MOF-210 (not in the figure) that is reported to have a bulk density of
0.25 g/cm3 and a specific surface area of 6400 m2/g provided one of the

of Chemistry.

highest  reported  CO2  uptake  capacity  of  about  55  molCO2/kg  of
MOF-210 at room temperature and 5 MPa pressure [269].

A recent addition to the class of framework structure materials is the
zeolite imidazole framework (ZIF) materials where the metal atoms such
(cid:0)
as Zn are linked through N atoms imidoazolate (C3N2H3
: Im) or func-
tionalized  Im  links.  The  topology  of  ZIFs  is  largely  governed  by  the
functionality of the imidazolate, which allows topology modifications
achieved by specific functionalization of the Im group. This is illustrated
in Fig. 37, where the pore size and surface area display almost a linear
relationship. Such controllable flexibility in varying the pore size and
◦
surface area, as well as their thermal stability up to 300
C [267] makes
ZIFs  an  attractive  class  of  materials  for  gas  separation,  catalysis  and
other application.

Despite such high CO2 capacities and tunable properties such as pore
size and surface area, it is too early to assume that MOFs (or, ZIFs) may
lead  to  promising  solutions  for  post-combustion  CO2  capture.  In  fact,
thermal  and  mechanical  stability  at  temperatures  significantly  higher
than room temperature as well as thermal compatibility with flue gas
streams are general concerns. As with most solids, their CO2 adsorption
capacities rapidly decrease with increasing temperature and decreasing
CO2 pressure. Hysteresis in capacity between adsorption and desorption
cycles is also not fully understood. The impact of moisture and other coal
contaminants  on  the  structural  and  chemical  stability  as  well  as  the
adsorption capacity requires further investigation and improvement for
post-combustion CO2 capture [268]. There is of course room for progress
in improving the adsorption capacity especially at low CO2 pressures by
synthesizing MOFs with proper pores sizes and surface area, as well as
by strengthening the interactive forces between the CO2 molecules and
MOFs by introducing unsaturated metal sites in the structure. Further-
more,  devising  cost-effective  synthesis  routes  for  MOFs  can  improve
their  economic  competitiveness.  These  concerns  and  knowledge  gaps
require full understanding and resolution before MOFs and ZIFs can be
employed for post-combustion CO2 capture.

5.3. CO2  separation by membranes

Gas separation membranes have been employed in the industry for
nearly three decades,  mostly for air separation or oxygen enrichment
applications aimed for combustion processes. Recently, oxygen enrich-
ment or purification by air separation membranes have also gained in-
terest  for  thermoelectric  power  generation  by  integrated  gasification
combined cycle (IGCC) and oxy-combustion processes [111,138,270].
Despite  the  technological  gains  in  O2  separation,  however,  there  are
currently no commercial membranes available for CO2  separation and
capture from power plant flue gas streams, but there is ample interest
[89].

Major advancements in the development and commercialization of
′
gas  separation  membranes  in  the  1980
s  were  achieved  by  polymer-
based  asymmetric  membranes  used  primarily  for  oxygen  enrichment
via air separation [271]. In addition, mixed matrix or polymer-ceramic
composite membranes have been explored for enhanced selectivity and
permeability [125]. Similarly, ceramic membranes with microporous or
mesoporous microstructures have been developed. Microporous mem-
branes  may  be  employed  as  such  or  impregnated  with  a  suitable
CO2-active  secondary  phase  such  as  an  amine  solution.  Mesoporous
membranes  such  as  zeolites  and  metal-organic  framework  structures
have well defined crystallographic channels and voids that allow mo-
lecular sieving. On the other hand, dense inorganic membranes made
from Pd-alloys such as Cu-Pd and Ag-Pd have absolute selectivity for H2
through  ionic  transport  through  the  Pd  crystal  lattice  and  have  been
widely used in the industry for separation and purification of H2  espe-
cially from gas mixtures of water gas shift reaction products, but possess

no solubility for CO2  and hence not useful for CO2  separation. Neither
are  MIEC  oxide  membranes  that  are  selective  for  oxide  ion  transport
only (see Section 4.1.3), and not suitable for separation of CO2. Table 14
provides a summary of major types, properties and operating principles
of different membrane families that are relevant to separation of CO2 for
capture.

The two most important parameters for both polymeric and micro-
porous  membranes  are  selectivity  and  permeability,  the  product  of
which is defined as the separation factor (also called, separation power).

Sepration Factor = Selective × Permeability

(18)

Naturally,  high  separation  power  is  a  desirable  quality  of  a  pro-
spective membrane. However, membrane selectivity and permeability
unfortunately have an inverse relationship, whereby high permeability
results  in  low  selectivity,  and  vice  versa.  This  poses  a  fundamental
barrier  to  achieve  high  selectivity  and  high  permeability  at  the  same
time with the same membrane type or composition. Tuning and modi-
fication of materials properties by doping, pore size and porosity con-
trol,  and  process  engineering,  as  well  as  surface  treatment  and
functionalization may help achieve more favorable membrane proper-
ties. In both polymeric and microporous membranes, the driving force
for transport is the pressure difference, i.e., the chemical potential dif-
ference, of the gaseous species across the membrane. Naturally, larger
the pressure differential and thinner the membrane, steeper is the force
gradient  across  the  membrane  wall  and  higher  is  the  mass  flux,  or
permeability. So  it  is  desirable to fabricate  the  membranes as  thin as
possible, but also with adequate mechanical integrity to withstand and
maintain the pressure differential across the wall.

5.3.1. CO2  separation by polymeric membranes

necessary.

The dominant fundamental mechanism for gas separation in poly-
meric  membranes is by  preferential solution-diffusion of gaseous spe-
cies, whereby certain gas molecules absorb or adsorb within void spaces
in the polymer matrix and diffuse through the open channels among the
polymer chains, while other components of the gas mixture pass through
membrane relatively less affected. This is due to interaction of individ-
ual gaseous species with the polymer matrices with different strengths
and rates for absorption, adsorption and diffusion. Accordingly, absolute
selectivity for a certain gas in a mixture is almost impossible to achieve
with polymeric membranes. There is always a trade-off between selec-
tivity and flux (or, permeability). Typically high permeability polymers
such  as  rubbery  or  elastomeric  open  structure  polymers  offer  high
permeability  but  poor  selectivity,  while  glassy  or  semi-crystalline
polymers  offer  high  selectivity  but  low  permeability.  For  this  reason,
the gas mixture needs to be recycled many times through the membrane
in  order  to  achieve  the  required level  of  enrichment.  In  other  words,
polymeric membranes cannot accomplish absolute separation of CO2.

The difficulty of selective separation of CO2 from N2-rich mixtures is
highlighted  by  comparison  of  their  closely  related  physicochemical
properties that are presented in Table 11 above. Most importantly, the
kinetic diameter of CO2 (0.33 nm) is quite close to N2 (0.364 nm), which
makes it difficult to use size exclusion effectively. So further develop-
ment  of  CO2-selective  polymeric  membranes  is  likely  to  follow  two
strategic approaches, namely, increase the CO2  solubility and enhance
CO2  diffusion  rate  through  the  polymer  matrix.  Careful  design  and
fabrication of polymers with appropriate void spaces or channels having
a  certain  size,  side  groups,  structure,  and  chain  conformation  may
improve  both  selectivity  and  permeability.  Chain  dynamics  alter  the
void spaces in the polymer matrix and allow the diffusion of the gaseous
species. To achieve improved selectivity and permeability in polymeric
membranes,  mixed-matrix  membranes  made  by  grafting  or  blending
different  polymers  having  complimentary  properties,  or  by  blending
inorganic adsorbents into polymer matrices have been explored [125].
Partly due to its smaller kinetic diameter of 0.265 nm (see Table 11),
H2O  is  preferentially  separated  at  the  expense  of  CO2  through  most
polymer  membranes.  This  necessitates  drying  of  the  flue  gas  stream
before the membrane separation process. Selectivity and permeability
parameters  for  CO2  separation  from  CO2-N2  mixtures  using  various
single phase or blended polymeric membranes are presented in Table 15
for comparison.

Aside  from  the  mechanistic  aspects  of  separation,  CO2  capture  by
polymeric membranes from power plant flue streams pose other chal-
lenges.  The  low  concentration  of  CO2  in  the  flue  gas  stream  requires
large membrane surface area to process huge volumes of flue gas. The
membrane material must have sufficient chemical stability against the
wide range of contaminants present in the flue gas streams emitted from
coal-fired  plants.  Moreover,  the  flue  gas  requires  drying  prior  to  the
membrane separation operation as water vapor in the flue gas competes
favorably with CO2 and diffuses faster through the membrane. Hence, a
gas  clean  up  operation  prior  to  the  membrane  separation  process  is

Thermal  and  mechanical  stability  of  the  polymeric  membrane  are
also  critical  considerations.  High  exit  temperature  of  hot  flue  gasses
from the power plant is not compatible with the operating temperature
regime  of  polymeric  membranes,  and  hence  the  flue  stream  must  be

damage to the polymeric structure of the membrane. At the same time,
the  flue  gas  needs  to  be  pressurized  to  generate  a  pressure  gradient
across the membrane that drives the separation and collection of CO2 on
the permeate side. Nevertheless, progress has been made in both fronts.
A polymeric membrane made of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)-poly(acrylic

mechanical  operations  and  steps  add  cost  and  energy  penalty  to  the
overall  capture  process.  The  latter  needs  to  be  paid  by  the  produced
energy and naturally lowers the overall plant efficiency as well as for
CO2  capture.  Indeed,  a  recent  study  compared  post-combustion  CO2
capture  by  polymeric  membranes  versus  amine  absorption  and
concluded that from an energetic point of view, membrane separation is
not competitive with amine absorption, and estimated that for 10% CO2
in the flue gas, the energy requirement for polymeric membrane may be
around 8 MJ/kgCO2, while it is about 4 MJ/kgCO2 for amine absorption
[273].

5.3.2. CO2  separation by microporous inorganic membranes

In general, inorganic membranes can be viewed in two broad cate-
gories  in  terms  of  their  porosities,  namely,  porous  membranes,  and
impervious (or, dense) membranes [274]. However, only porous inor-
ganic  membranes  offer  practical  relevance  to  CO2  separation.  Major
advances in inorganic membranes for CO2 separation and capture have
been discussed and presented in recent review articles [89,275]. These
membranes  may  be  made  of  various  carbon  nanostructures  such  as
carbon nanotubes or hollow fibers, or various oxides such as zeolites,
silica, alumina, and metal-organic frameworks. Electrochemical molten
membranes  based  on  predominantly  ionically  conducting  eutectics  of
alkali-metal  carbonates  constitute  another  category  discussed  below.
Microporous inorganic membranes can be self-standing, or they may be
deposited as thin layers or dispersions on inert or active substrates that
provide mechanical support and robustness. Support materials may be
made of porous ceramics such as silica, alumina, titania, zirconia, porous
glasses, or porous metals such as stainless steel. As an example, micro-
structure of a zeolite membrane supported on a porous alumina tubular
substrate  is  presented  in  Fig.  38.  The  inherent  chemical  and  thermal
stability  of  inorganic materials  make  them attractive  for  CO2  capture
from  power  plant  flue  streams.  Their  exceptionally  wide  operating
◦
temperature regime from room temperature up to 1000
C or above is a
major advantage for thermal management of the flue gas feed directly
from  the  power  plant  and  results  in  high  efficiency  for  CO2  capture.
Despite their chemical stability and resilience against flue gasses con-
taining  coal  contaminants,  presence  of  humidity  in  the  feed  gas
adversely impacts the adsorption and selective transport properties of
most  inorganic  membranes.  Moreover,  even  though  the  membrane
materials can withstand operation at elevated temperatures, the selec-
tivity  for  CO2  diminishes  at  these  temperatures.  Hence,  the  optimum
operating temperature for most inorganic and composite membranes is

slows their development efforts.

5.3.2.1. Carbon-based  membranes. Carbonaceous  adsorbents  such  as
activated carbon have long been employed for many industrial separa-
tion  processes  due  to  their  advantages  including  abundance,  wide
availability, thermal stability, low cost, and low sensitivity to moisture.
On  the  other  hand,  despite  the  hydrophobic  nature  of  most  carbons,
moisture adsorbs competitively with CO2 on carbonaceous sorbents that
interact weakly with CO2  due to its relatively low heat of adsorption.
Comparatively, the heat of adsorption for  CO2  on activated carbon is
(cid:0) 30 kJ/mol, while it is (cid:0) 36 kJ/mol for most zeolites [190]. Moreover,
the selectivity for preferential adsorption of CO2  on carbon-based ad-
sorbents and membranes decreases with increasing operating tempera-
ture, and this limits their practical prospects for CO2  capture from hot
flue streams.

Hence,  much  of  the  recent  progress  to  improve  the  selective
adsorptive  properties  of  carbon-based  membranes  has  focused  on
increasing  surface  area,  controlling  pore  size  distribution,  nano-
structuring,  and  surface  engineering  including  functionalization  or
chemical activation to increase surface alkalinity using CO2-active ad-
ditives such as amines [190,279]. Several types of microstructures are
employed in  carbon membranes, including single-wall and  multi-wall
carbon nanotubes, carbon molecular sieves, carbon hollow fibers, and
graphene [232,235,280,281].

Many  of  the  carbon  microstructures  for  membranes  are  generally
made by pyrolysis of polymeric or organic precursors in the absence of
◦
oxygen at elevated temperatures typically in the range 500 to 1000
C.
Generally,  thermosetting  type  polymers  are  the  preferred  precursor
materials for this purpose. The resulting carbon microstructure, such as
hollow  fibers,  can  be  supported  on  porous  inert  substrates  including
alumina, zirconia, titania, or polymers for improved mechanical integ-
rity.  The  microstructures  usually  have  narrow  size  distribution  of  in-
ternal  bore  diameters  that  can  range  from  less  than  1 nm  to  several
nanometers depending on the polymer precursor type and shape, as well
as  the  pyrolysis  conditions.  Such  control  of  narrow  size  distribution
makes it possible to separate gasses by molecular sieving. Indeed, mo-
lecular sieving was recently demonstrated using several stacked nano-
sheets of graphene oxide that are supported on polyether block amide
(PEBA) copolymer substrate via hydrogen bonding, and gave superior
CO2  separation  performance  with  CO2  permeability  of  100  Barrer  (1
(STP).m/(m2.s.mHg)) and selectivity of 91 from CO2/
Barrer = 10
N2  gas  mixtures  at  room  temperature  and  0.3 MPa  pressure  [235].
Similarly,  it  was  reported  that  single-wall  carbon  nanotubes  exhibit
twice the CO2 capacity of activated carbon [282].

(cid:0) 12  m3

It should be noted that the chemical and thermal tolerance of carbon-
based  materials  and  the  ability  to  synthesize  or  fabricate  them  in  a
controlled  manner,  make  them  attractive  also  for  CO2  separation  by
pressure  swing  adsorption  [256].  As  adsorptive  capacity  for  CO2  im-
proves with  external pressure, carbon-based sorbents and membranes
are attractive for such high pressure applications. On the other hand,
capacity and selectivity of these materials for CO2 are adversely affected

when pore size and the molecular diameter of the gaseous species are
comparable, surface diffusion where one gaseous species preferentially
has a higher surface diffusion coefficient, capillary condensation within
the  pores  of  the  membrane,  and  molecular  sieving  by  size  exclusion
principle.  Several  of  these  transport  mechanisms  are  schematically
illustrated in Fig. 39. Diffusion within intersecting channels as in zeolite
structures  or  between  cages  as  in  MOFs  has  also  been  considered  as
important transport mechanisms [89].

Gas separation by inorganic microporous membranes are dictated by
several factors including the heat of adsorption, which is indicative of
how tightly or loosely the gas molecules bind to the membrane surface,
the sizes of gas molecules with respect to the pore size of the membrane,
porosity and tortuosity of the membrane, thickness of the active mem-
brane  layer,  operating temperature,  and  specific  surface  area.  Tuning
the adsorption properties of the membrane by surface engineering [277]
and/or functionalization especially by surface amine groups [278] help
improve the CO2  adsorption capacity and surface diffusion. Similarly,
micro- and nanostructuring of the membrane by advanced processing
tools  and  techniques  can  allow  tuning  of  the  pore  size  and  porosity
distribution  in  the  membrane  that  can  maximize  the  preferential
transport  of  the  desired  gaseous  species  such  as  CO2.  Nevertheless,
generally  low  selectivity  and  permeability  (or,  gas  flux)  through
microporous inorganic membranes have been a persistent problem that

by  increasing  temperature,  which  poses  a  challenge  for  practical
applications.

5.3.2.2. Silica-based membranes. Porous silica, made generally by using
sol-gel or hydrothermal synthesis techniques, is often employed not as
the active membrane but as the inert or less active support material for
the  more  active  and  CO2  selective  membrane  or  sorption  material
deposited  on  the  silica.  Accordingly,  most  of  the  silica-based  meso-
porous  membranes  used  for  active  separation  have  either  undergone
amine functionalization or grafting on its surface, or impregnation into
the  pores  in  order  to  improve  their  CO2  adsorption  and  separation
◦
properties.  At  high  temperatures  (>200
C)  mesoporous  silica  mem-
branes offer selective separation of H2  from H2/CO2  mixtures by mo-
lecular  sieving  mechanism,  and  good  permeability  that  can  compete
favorably  with  the  impervious  Pd-based  membranes  commercially
employed  in  the  industry  for  hydrogen  separation.  Similarly,  amine-
functionalized  porous  silica  membranes  at  room  temperature  exhibit
good selectivity up to 800 for CO2 separation from CO2/N2 mixtures due
to the preferential adsorption of CO2 [283]. However, typically low CO2
permeability values, which can further be reduced significantly by the
presence of water vapor in the gas mixture, render silica-based mem-
branes fall short of competing favorably with other candidates [89].

5.3.2.3. Zeolite-based membranes. Preferential adsorption and size and
shape  selective  properties  of  zeolites  are  already  discussed  in  Section
5.2.3.1. above and a representative microstructure of a porous alumina-
supported zeolite membrane is given in Fig. 38. Indeed, zeolite-based
membranes are usually fabricated on a porous substrate such as stain-
less  steel  or  alumina  by  hydrothermal  synthesis.  Size  selection  (or,
exclusion)  property  of  zeolites  is  illustrated  in  Fig.  40,  where  the
permeation rates of various gasses including CO2  through two zeolite-
based  framework  structure  membranes,  namely,  ZIF-7  and  SIM-1  are
provided as a function of their kinetic diameters. Because of their similar
kinetic diameters and physical properties (see Table 11), the permeation
rates for CO2  and N2  are quite similar in both zeolite structures, high-
lighting  the  difficulty  in  separating  CO2  from  N2-rich  flue  gasses.  To
improve  CO2  selectivity,  chemical  and  structural  modification  of  the
zeolite  cages  with  appropriate  cations  or  amine-functionalization  is
required  to  achieve  preferential  adsorption.  Although  much  of  the

zeolite-based  membrane  studies  have  been  concerned  with  CO2/CH4
separation for sweetening of natural gas and CO2/H2  for H2  recovery
from water gas shift process, the highest values for CO2 separation fac-
tors of 70 and 200 are reported for FAU (faujasite) and T-type (Linde
type T) zeolites, respectively, from a 50:50 mixture of CO2  and N2  at
room temperature [89].

For most types of zeolites, the heats of adsorption of gasses follow the
trend CO2 > N2 > CH4 > H2 consistent with the strength of electrostatic
interaction of each molecule with the zeolite lattice. As CO2 is smaller in
size  than  N2  and  also  adsorbs  more  strongly  on  most  zeolites,  it  per-
meates  preferentially  in  CO2/N2  and  CO2/CH4  mixtures  at  low  tem-
peratures.  At  high  temperatures,  however,  competitive  adsorption
diminishes,  and  results  in  CO2  selectivity  values  comparable  with  its
counterpart in CO2/N2 or CO2/CH4 systems. This is depicted in Fig. 41,
which also highlights the adverse impact of water vapor in on both the
permeability and selectivity of CO2  near ambient temperatures. How-
ever, the impact of moisture diminishes with increasing temperature, as
does  CO2  selectivity  [89].  As  in  almost  all  solid  sorbents  and  mem-
branes, weakening of the bond with increasing temperature between the
adsorbed  species  and  the  surface  site  is  a  common  drawback  that
adversely  limits  the  practical  operating  temperature  regime  for  these
membranes.

5.3.2.4. Alumina-based membranes. Because of its high chemical, ther-
mal and  hydrothermal stability,  alumina is  a  desirable material  espe-
cially  for  high  temperature  applications.  However  in  most  cases,
alumina  is  employed  as  the  porous  support  to  provide  mechanical,
thermal  and  chemical  integrity  for  the  active  membrane  material.  In
those cases where alumina is the active membrane material, it is syn-
thesized  as  a  mesoporous  structure  with  pore  sizes  in  the  nanometer
rage, such that the dominant gas transport mechanism is by Knudsen
diffusion. However, alumina has poor selectivity for CO2, and this is one
of the reasons that it is employed more often as a support material rather
than the active membrane.

5.4. CO2  capture by cryogenic distillation

This is a low temperature capture process that requires cooling, or
rather refrigeration, of the flue gas down to below the CO2 sublimation
◦
temperature  of  (cid:0) 100  to  (cid:0) 135
C  and  from  10  to  20 MPa  pressure  in
order to solidify the CO2  in the flue gas mixture. This cryogenic distil-
lation separates the gasses with respect to their boiling points, and can

recover up to 90% to 95% of the CO2  in the feed flue stream. As ex-
pected, however, this is a highly energy intensive process that requires
cryogenic temperatures and high pressures. It is estimated that the en-
ergy  penalty  for  cryogenic  distillation  may  be  in  the  range  of  600  to
660 kWh/tCO2 recovered in liquid form [284].

5.5. CO2  capture by electrochemical separation

Binary or ternary eutectic mixtures of alkali metal carbonates such as
Li2CO3,  Na2CO3,  and  K2CO3  are  excellent  electrolytes  that  selectively

temperatures.  For  this  reason,  alkali  metal  carbonate  eutectics  have
been employed as selective electrolytes in molten carbonate fuel cells
(MCFC)  for  many  decades  [285,286].  MCFC’s  typically  operate  at
◦
temperatures between 500 and 800
C. This temperature window is well
matched with the typical exit temperature regimes of flue streams from
point  source  plants  and  processes.  Furthermore,  molten  carbonate
membranes  offer  thermal  and  chemical  compatibility  with  CO2-con-
taining flue gasses for highly selective separation and capture of CO2.

The general concept of CO2  capture using a molten carbonate fuel
cell configuration goes back several decades [287]. Operationally, the
molten carbonate membrane configuration for electrochemical separa-
tion of CO2  may be employed in two different modes. It can either be
driven externally by a power source, as in typical electrolysis mode, or
via the electromotive force generated by the presence of a fuel such as H2
at the anode side, as in a fuel cell mode. In either case, typical anode and
cathode  materials  are  Ni  and  NiO,  respectively.  But  regardless  of  the
separation mode, membrane configuration or cell architecture, all these
approaches employ the same reduction reaction of CO2 to carbonate ion
at the cathode expressed by,
CO2 + 1⁄2 O2 + 2e(cid:0) = CO3

(cid:0) 2

(19)

The  carbonate  ion,  CO3

,  is  transported  through  the  molten  car-
bonate  electrolyte and  evolves  at  the  anode as  CO2  by  the  reverse of
reaction (19). Unfortunately, the anode reaction also involves the evo-
lution of one molecule of O2 for every two molecules of CO2, and hence,

Fig. 42. Schematic of a molten carbonate fuel cell for post-combustion capture

undergoes  reduction.  The  presence  of  the  H2  fuel  at  the  anode  provides  the
driving force to transport the carbonate ion in the molten carbonate eutectic,

requires  an  additional  separation  step  to  recover  CO2.  To  avoid  this
additional step, it was proposed that H2 supplied to the anode provides
the necessary downhill driving force for transporting the carbonate ions
to  the  anode  [288].  In  other  words,  this  configuration  schematically
depicted in Fig. 42 allows CO2  separation to be accomplished sponta-
neously in a fuel cell mode simultaneously generating electrical power,
rather than in electrolysis mode that would otherwise require expending
external power. An added benefit of this approach is also the fact that
CO2 and H2O are the primary products of the anode reaction, and as O2
is not a byproduct anymore in this configuration, removing the water
vapor via condensation from the anode stream allows easy capture of
CO2. However, the reported CO2 permeance (= permeability/membrane

thickness) for this configuration was low, less than 5 × 10
◦
Pa.s) at 450 to 650
C with a modest selectivity value of 16 for CO2/N2
mixtures [288]. The major drawback of this scheme is that the H2 fuel
used  to  drive  CO2  separation  does  not  occur  in  nature,  and  must  be
produced first. Accordingly, a life cycle analysis including the produc-
tion of H2 is required to assess the overall energy efficiency and cost of
separation using this electrochemical approach.

Dual-phase membrane systems based on molten carbonates have also
been proposed and explored for CO2 separation [289–291]. Variants of
this  approach  can  be  grouped  under  two  categories,  namely,  (a)
self-driven  membranes  made  typically  of  a  composite  of  molten  car-
bonate  and  a  chemically  stable  but  electronically  conducting  porous
support such as stainless steel, and (b) electrochemically-driven mem-
branes,  which  can  either  be  solely  made  up  of  the  molten  carbonate
eutectic, or as a composite of an oxide ion conducting but electronically
insulating porous ceramic such as stabilized zirconia that contains the
molten carbonate within its open porosity.

s) at 850
C [290].  Similarly, a ternary  Li-Na-K carbonate-based elec-
trolysis  concept  was  demonstrated  for  capturing  CO2,  but  taking  the
concept one step further to electrochemically splitting the CO2 fully into
pure oxygen and high surface area carbon particles [293]. In this study,
it  was  assumed  that  the  electrical  energy  required  to  drive  the  CO2
electrolysis  reaction  to  carbon  and  oxygen  is  supplied  by  renewable
sources.

Despite the promising features of molten carbonate systems, these
approaches all suffer inherent problems and difficulties, namely, their
highly corrosive nature (i.e., hot corrosion), the dissolution of the metal
support  of  the  electrode  materials  in  the  molten  eutectic,  and  their
chemical stability, which all give rise to performance degradation after
long use. In the electrolysis mode, O2 must be separated to obtain a pure
CO2 stream, while in fuel cell mode, energy penalty and cost of upstream
H2  production  must  be  considered  as  integral  part  of  the  assessment
analyses. Also, all schemes exhibit modest values for CO2 permeability,
and  hence  separation  rates,  at  best.  Many  of  these  challenges  are
fundamental in nature and difficult to avoid or overcome, which limit
the  prospects  of  this  interesting  electrochemical  approach  to  CO2
capture.

6. Direct capture of CO2  from ambient air

One  of  the  ways  to  achieve  negative  emissions  is  to  capture  CO2
directly from the atmosphere. Although methods of removing CO2 from
air in enclosed environments such as submarines go back for decades,

the concept of capturing CO2 directly from ambient atmosphere for the
explicit  purpose  of  reducing  atmospheric  concentrations  was  first
advocated  nearly  two  decades  ago  [294].  Despite  concerns  raised
regarding  the  economic  and  technical  feasibility  of  direct  air  capture
(DAC),  there  has  been  growing  interest  and  activity  to  explore  this
negative emissions technology [104,295,296]. Proponents of DAC have
long argued that even if carbon emissions were to be stopped all together
today,  CO2  that  has  already  accumulated  in  the  atmosphere  cannot
eliminate the risks of climate change and incipient warming. So atmo-
spheric  CO2  concentrations  need  to  be  reduced  expeditiously.  It  is
further argued that climate change mitigation strategies should involve
a broad range of diverse technologies that include direct air capture, in
order to affect a net reduction in the current atmospheric levels. How-
ever, CO2  capture requires large amounts of water, and hence must be
sited  in  close  proximity  to  a  water  source.  Moreover,  DAC  is  not  site
specific and does not need to be located near emission sources. It offers
the  important  opportunity  to  capture  CO2  emissions  from  distributed
sources,  which  make  up  nearly  1⁄2  of  the  global  CO2  emissions,  as
opposed  to  most  of  the  other  technologies,  which  cater  more  to
capturing from point emission sources. This is an important distinction
and an advantage for DAC.

Most  of  the  CO2  capture  technologies,  processes  and  materials
reviewed in this article above are also relevant and applicable to DAC,
and will not be discussed here further. Only the salient features of DAC
are  reviewed  and  assessed.  Recent  progress  and  advances  in  sorbent
materials and capture processes for DAC are recently reviewed exten-
sively elsewhere [297]. Besides technological CCS processes, there are of
course naturally occurring terrestrial mechanisms that help capture CO2
directly from the atmosphere including uptake by large bodies of water
such  as  lakes  and  oceans,  biomass  growth  on  land  and  in  sea,  and
mineralization  into  carbonates  by  naturally  occurring  sediments  and
minerals  on  land.  However,  these  processes  are  generally  considered
outside of DAC’s domain of interest, and not covered here.

While  the  atmospheric  concentration  of  CO2  (~  414  ppmv)  is
alarmingly high for climate mitigation but quite low for effective cap-
ture, it is not surprising that DAC is a highly energy intensive and costly
technology.  Indeed,  the  theoretical  minimum  energy  requirement  for
DAC  is  ~22 kJ/molCO2  at  room  temperature.  Naturally,  the  actual
amount  of  energy  demand  for  DAC  is  several  times  larger.  Indeed,  a
recent techno-economic modeling study assuming a scaled up DAC ca-
pacity increasing by 1.5 GtCO2/yr has estimated the energy requirement
for  DAC to be up  to  300 EJ/yr  (300×1018 J/yr)  by 2100  [298]. DAC
technology also requires a large real estate footprint, as it relies on large
contact areas for effective CO2  uptake during the scrubbing or absorp-
tion operations. This necessitates huge contactor facilities with nearly
300 times more contactor area than would be required to capture CO2
from a combustion point source such as the exhaust stream of a power
plant [299]. Indeed, large volumes of air need to be processed to over-
come the unfavorable CO2/air ratio of ~1/2500 and to remove mean-
ingful quantities of CO2. Its low concentration in air also discourages
many of the technologies that particularly require heating, cooling, and
compression from consideration. Moreover, similar molecular diameters
of  CO2  (0.330 nm),  N2  (0.364 nm)  and  O2  (0.346 nm)  render
size-selective separation of CO2  by membranes practically ineffective.
This  leaves  absorption  or  adsorption  as  technically  and  economically
more  viable  choices  for  DAC.  These  sorption  technologies  generally
involve  chemical  sorbents  that  exhibit  high  binding  affinity  for  CO2
relative to N2 and O2. These chemical sorbents include aqueous alkaline
solutions of suitable sorbent hydroxides such NaOH, KOH, and Ca(OH)2,
hybrid  organic-inorganic  sorbents,  or  a  rich  variety  of  amine-based
sorbents often supported  on solids to capture CO2. Aqueous solutions
offer the advantage of longer air-water contact times, as well as cheaper
and continuous operation of cooling towers. Fortunately, many of the
technological  options  discussed  above  for  post-combustion  separation
including solvents, membranes and sorbents are also being considered
and  assessed  for  DAC,  as  DAC  can  in  principle  be  viewed  within  the

domain  of  post-combustion  separation.  Most  DAC  processes  under
development involve scrubbing large volumes of air in alkaline solutions
and  capturing  CO2  as  solid  carbonates,  which  are  then  calcined  at
elevated temperatures to recover the CO2 in highly pure form [103].

To appreciate the scale of the challenge to DAC or CO2  capture in
general, note that to reduce atmospheric concentration of CO2 by only 1
ppmv, it is necessary to capture and remove nearly 7.8 Gt of CO2 from
the atmosphere [45]. This is a daunting task, and unfortunately, we do
not  yet  have  cost-effective  CO2  capture  technologies  available  at  the
multi-gigaton scale that can be deployed to mitigate emissions and affect
atmospheric concentrations.

As expected, the low concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere renders
DAC an economically costly process. For DAC to compete with other CO2
capture alternatives, it needs to become cost effective at large scale. The
cost of DAC was estimated to be $610/tCO2 excluding compression for
transportation and sequestration, based on the average carbon intensity
(i.e., carbon footprint per unit of energy produced) of 610 kgCO2/MWh
for  the  US  power  grid  in  2011  [45].  Comparing  this  to  the  reference
2011 cost of ~$80/tCO2  for capturing from coal power plant flue gas
stream,  DAC  was  deemed  prohibitively  expensive.  More  recently,  a
2016 U.S.-DOE task force report suggested that costs must be brought
down to below $200/tCO2  by technological advances for DAC to offer
cautious viability [31]. The report also concluded that DAC might play
at best a modest role in climate change mitigation over the next several
decades,  and  only  if  based  on  renewable sources.  Another  study  esti-
mated the cost of cutting CO2  emissions by replacing carbon-intensive
power  generation  technologies  with  solar  cells  to  be  around
$500/tCO2,  challenging  the  investments  made  for  solar  cells  [300].
Others  questioned  if  air  capture  is  the  best  way  to  spend  resources,
which may take funds away from developing more cost-effective solu-
tions,  and  concluded  that  DAC  may  make  sense  only  after  all  CO2
emissions from centralized and point sources are captured [45].

A recent techno-economic study estimated the levelized cost of DAC
to range between $94 and $232/tCO2 when CO2 is delivered at 15 MPa
using  either  8.81  GJ  of  natural  gas,  or  a  combination  of  5.25  GJ  of
natural gas and 366 kWh of electricity, per ton of CO2 captured from air
[301]. These values highlight the high thermodynamic barrier for CO2
separation  from  air  that  requires  significant  energy  expenditures  for
capture, and likely to create new emissions unless this energy is supplied
from renewable sources. Indeed, it was suggested that DAC would be
incompatible with high carbon energy sources such as fossil fuels [45].
The CO2 separation step in DAC is energetically the most intensive and
financially  the  most  expensive  step.  Indeed,  the  minimum  theoretical
work requirement is more than 20 kJ/molCO2  [103], and the mechan-
ical work to isothermally compress the recovered CO2 from 0.1 to 6 MPa
pressure adds another 11 kJ/molCO2 [104]. Accordingly for any carbon
capture  and  sequestration  (CCS)  technology  to  be  viable,  the  down-
stream benefits of capturing CO2 from air should exceed these minimum
energy requirements.

Despite the economic and technical risks, several start-up companies
are already exploring DAC technology for commercial purposes, as part
of a complementary solution to help reduce anthropogenic CO2  in the
atmosphere. Notably, Carbon Engineering in Canada and Climeworks in
Switzerland have been developing DAC technologies, and there are now
about 15 DAC plants already operating in Europe, the United State and
Canada  [302].  However,  their  capacities  are  all  rather  small.  For
example,  the  largest  DAC  plant  so  far,  named  Orca,  currently  under
construction  by  Climeworks  and  planned  to  start  operations  in  2021
aims to capture merely 4000 tCO2 annually [302]. Such small capacities
also help highlight the enormous challenges of capturing at the gigaton
scale that would be required to make a difference.

7. CO2  transport

Commercial  transport  of  carbon  dioxide  may  be  accomplished  by
pipelines, tanks, rail, and ships [303–307]. For distances typically of the

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience89(2022)10096537

order  of  1000 km,  pipelines  are  the  most  common  and  commercially
mature way to transport CO2 from point emission sources to the point of
use, usually for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) and other applications. For
distances much longer, or across large bodies of water, transport by ship
is more preferable. Rail or tanker transport may be suitable for small
quantities CO2 over short distances.

Depending  on  the  method  used  for  capturing  it, CO2  may  contain
impurities such as SOx, NOx, amines, NH3, CO, H2, N2, and O2, besides
moisture.  These  impurities  affect  the  physicochemical  and  hydrody-
namic  properties  of  the  CO2  gas  mixture,  including  its  viscosity,
compressibility,  and  fluid  dynamics,  as  well  as  the  corrosion  and
potentially hydrogen embrittlement of the transport vessel or pipeline.
Hence,  these  impurities  may  have  to  be  removed  and  the  CO2  gas
dehumidified prior to compression and transport. Moisture is a critical
component and demands special consideration. Dry CO2 typically con-
taining < 10 ppmv H2O is not corrosive to pipelines made of carbon-
manganese steels that may also tolerate the presence of other contami-
nants.  On  the  other  hand,  moist  CO2  is  highly  corrosive  even  at
moderately high temperatures and requires highly expensive corrosion
resistant alloys that are internally coated with an additional corrosion
barrier  layer  [308].  Hence,  moisture  is  generally  removed  from  CO2
before transportation in order to avoid the high cost of pipeline material.
For  distances  significantly  longer  than  1000 km,  sea  transport  offer
better  economics  and  is  generally  preferred,  but  nevertheless  require
similar measures of removing moisture.

CO2 can be transported in several forms, including gas, liquid, or as
supercritical fluid. The latter can be achieved when CO2 is compressed
◦
above the critical pressure of 7.38 MPa at or above 31
C as shown in
Fig. 43, where the densities of the liquid and gaseous CO2 phases become
equal  to  each  other  and  behave  as  a  single  fluid.  However,  the
compressibility  of  CO2  in  the  typical  operating  regime  for  pipeline
transport is nonlinear, and sensitive to the presence of impurities such as
H2S  [309].  Operating the  pipeline  at higher  pressures  (>8.6 MPa) re-
duces the nonlinear effect and increasingly pulls it more into the linear
regime.

In  order  to  maximize  the  mass-to-volume  ratio  during  transport,
dense  phases,  namely,  liquid  or  supercritical  CO2  are  preferred.
Expectedly, there is an energy penalty to achieve this state, because the
transport vehicle or the pipeline must maintain at all times the pressure
and temperature conditions commensurate with the transported phase
requirements as either liquid or supercritical CO2.

The CO2 transport system or mode chosen between the capture and
storage  sites  must  be  safe,  reliable,  energy  efficient,  environmentally
friendly, and cost-effective. The choice of transport mode, whether it is
by tanker ships and trucks, railroad tankers, or by pipeline, may also

depend on the volume of CO2, the length of the pipeline, and the dis-
tance and location of capture site with respect to the storage site. For
example, it was estimated that depending on the location of the emission
point  source,  the  costs  for  pipeline  transport  might  vary  by  30%.
Moreover, for a 500 MW plant located in the Midwest of U.S.A., it was
estimated that CO2  transport costs vary widely from $0.15/tCO2  for a
10 km long pipeline to $4.06/tCO2  for a 200 km pipeline [309]. Simi-
larly, an analysis in China estimated the transportation costs for 4000
ton  CO2  per  day  (or,  1.46  million  tons/year)  to  be  $12.64/tCO2  for
railroad  tankers,  $7.48/tCO2  for  ship  tankers,  and  $7.05/tCO2  for  a
300 km pipeline [310].

CO2 transport by ship is an alternative solution to pipeline transport
especially  to  offshore  enhanced  oil  recovery  sites,  and  involves
employing large volume (~20,000 m3) pressurized vessels or tankers at
or  above  the  triple  point  of  CO2  to  achieve  high  storage  densities.  A
North Sea tanker transport study of CO2 indicated that the liquefaction
process constitutes ~77% of the total energy requirement of 142 kWh/
tCO2  for the entire transport chain, and the cost of ship transport was
estimated  to  be  $20  to  $30/tCO2  for  annual  shipping  volumes  larger
than 2 MtCO2 and for distances limited to the North Sea [306]. Clearly,
the North Sea tanker transport study seems to indicate shipping costs are
more expensive than the cost of pipeline transport, and highlights the
importance  of  the  mode  of  transport  as  well  as  the  regional  and
geographic economics.

For long distance transport of CO2  over land, pipeline transport is
still considered the most viable option, especially if the emission source
is  a  point  source  such  as  a  power  plant  with  an  economic  lifetime
generally of several decades, which is compatible with the term of in-
vestment  for  building  the  pipeline.  However,  for  short  distances  be-
tween the CO2 source and storage, or for shorter source lifetimes, road,
railroad or even ship tankers may be more cost-effective.

Pipeline transport is a mature technology and supercritical CO2 is the
preferred form. This requires that the pipeline must be operated above
the  supercritical pressure and  temperature. Usually, supercritical CO2
pipelines are operated at pressures between 8.5 and 15 MPa, and tem-
◦
peratures between 13
C in order to maintain the stable single
phase flow of CO2 [311]. Moreover, large diameter pipelines lower the
pressure  drop  and  the  associated  pumping  losses,  and  hence  may  be
more energy efficient. But they also cost more to built. So the optimum
design must minimize both energy penalty and cost of transport. Some of
the key considerations for pipeline transport of CO2 include the pipeline
temperature and pressure, hydrate formation, corrosion, CO2 impurities,
and  last  but  not  least,  the  safety  and  reliability  to  avoid  catastrophic
failure. In Northern America, there is already 6560 km of installed CO2
pipeline  capacity  to  annually  transport  150  million  tons  of  CO2  for
enhanced oil recovery (EOR) purposes. However, this is far from the 37,
000 km of CO2 pipelines needed in the U.S. only, and over 150,000 km
needed in the European Union for large scale deployment of CCS by the
year 2050 [187].

8. CO2  storage options

Large-scale CCS at the multi-gigaton scale is considered as an effec-
tive way of mitigating CO2 emissions and climate change [187,188,312,
313]. Onshore or offshore deep underground storage of CO2 may benefit
from technologies and knowhow developed previously by oil and gas
industries. Geological structures and cavities, abandoned or depleted oil
and  gas  reservoirs,  depleted  coal  mines,  and  saline  aquifers  may  be
suitable underground options also for long term CO2  storage provided
that they offer effective trapping mechanisms to store large quantities in
a safe and economic manner. This requires fundamental understanding
and assessment of cooperative mechanisms and processes pertaining to
the  hydrology,  geochemistry,  and  geomechanics  of  the  storage  sites
[314]. Injecting vast volumes of pressurized CO2  into geological struc-
tures and formations leads to adverse effects including increased sub-
surface  pressure,  induced  seismic  activity,  contaminated  aquifers  and

subsurface water, and compromised storage integrity [315]. There are
also  socioeconomic,  environmental,  geological,  financial,  regulatory,
security,  and  policy  considerations  in  the  selection  and  evaluation  of
storage  sites.  The  multi-dimensionality  of  these  concerns  makes  it
challenging to devise consistent feasibility protocols for the assessment
and  qualification  of  potential
long-term  CO2
sequestration.

reservoirs

for

Incidentally at depths below 800 to 1000 m, supercritical CO2  pos-
sesses a density comparable to liquid (see Fig. 44) and can be trapped
effectively  underground.  Some  of  the  effective  storage  mechanisms
include  trapping  inside  the  pores  of  sedimentary  rocks  or  below  an
impervious rock layer (i.e., caprock), adsorption on organic matter in
coal  mines  or  shale  structures,  dissolution  in  underground  fluids  or
aquifers, and immobilization by reaction with natural minerals to form
solid carbonates (i.e., mineralization). Similarly, offshore underground
storage deep under the ocean is also possible. In fact, the Sleipner CCS
project, operational since the mid 1990
s, involves offshore storage of
CO2 in an underground saline formation beneath the North Sea bed.

′

However, for all onshore or offshore storage options to be viable, CO2
leakage rates from storage sites should be negligibly small, or there is
onsite recovery capability to capture the leaked CO2. Two major types of
leakage may occur at the storage site. Abrupt leakage may be caused by
catastrophic failure of the injection well or the well cap, which could
pose  great  health  and  environmental  hazard  and  even  loss  of  life  to
plants,  animals  and  humans  especially  in  the  low  lying  surrounding

and Resources.

area, as CO2  is lighter than air and settles down close to the ground.
Similarly, gradual leakage may be due to faults or fractures in the in-
jection  well  or  the  well  cap,  or  geological  fissures.  Susceptibility  to
seismic  activity  either  naturally  occurring  or  activated  by  large-scale
geological  storage  [315]  must  also  be  taken  under  consideration  as
real threats to the integrity of the seal that may trigger, when compro-
mised, abrupt or gradual leakage of CO2.

It is clear many of the storage options face multiplicity of technical,
economic, geographical, social and regulatory hurdles. For CO2 capture
to have a significant impact on reducing emissions, it has to be deployed,
implemented  and  stored  at  the  multi-gigaton  scale  annually.  Fortu-
nately,  there  is  ample  potential  capacity  for  CO2  storage  across  the
globe, with sedimentary basins offering 5,000 to 25,000 GtCO2, oil and
gas reservoirs around 1000 GtCO2, and saline aquifers adding 4,000 to
23,000  GtCO2  [187].  The  geographic  distribution  of  potential  CO2
storage reservoirs is illustrated in Fig. 45. It was suggested that under-
ground storage in deep saline aquifers potentially offers long lifetime for
CO2  storage  exceeding  100  years  [316].  At  CO2  storage  densities  of
nearly  0.6 kg/m3  [71],  storing  the  current annual CO2  emissions  that
exceed 37 Gigatons would require nearly 62,000 km3 of storage volume.
Such massive emission quantities dwarf the current industrial produc-
tion capacity worldwide (see Table 3), and pose further technical and
financial barriers for CCS in terms of the size scale of the problem.

CO2  sequestration  for  long  term  storage  presents  additional  chal-
lenges associated with safety, cost, proper site selection, induced seis-
micity [315], CO2  leakage, and active monitoring of both the storage
cavity underground and the surface site. The 2015 National Research
Council report [32] recommends further investigation of these concerns
posed by CO2  storage to fully understand and anticipate the potential
risks. It also recommends a portfolio of actions for developing advanced
CO2  removal  technologies  that  offer  the  potential  of  reducing  net
emissions.  It  recognizes  that  low  risk  strategies  and  technologies
currently  available  are  limited  by  cost  and  fall  short  of  removing
climatically significant quantities of CO2  beyond the natural processes
by land and sea.

Despite  immense  progress  in  renewable  energy  technologies
including  solar  and  wind,  their  share  in  the  total  energy  production
remains a growing but yet a small fraction, and lack of cost-effective,
utility  scale,  long-term  energy  storage  technologies  also  limit  their
rapid deployment [101]. It is likely that fossil fuels continue to play a
declining  albeit  a  major  role  in  the  global  energy  economy  into  the
foreseeable  future  [22].  Accordingly,  sequestration  and  long  term

proximity between the sources and storage sites [312].

storage of CO2 emissions is considered the most viable option to stabilize
the atmospheric CO2  concentration in the coming decades. An earlier
study estimated the total carbon storage needed in the 21st century to be
between 600 and 2400 Gt of carbon (or, 2200 to 8800 Gt of CO2) [188].
More  recently,  the  practically  accessible  global  capacity  for  geologic
sequestration of CO2  is estimated to  range between  8000 and  55,000
GtCO2 [317]. Clearly, there is sufficient geological storage potential for
CO2  sequestration.  For  large-scale  CO2  storage,  the  proximity  of  the
sequestration site to point sources is also an important consideration to
reduce the cost, logistic and technical challenges of CO2 transportation.
Fortunately,  there  is  good  matching  between  the  geographical  distri-
bution  of  large-scale  CO2  emitting  sources  around  the  globe  and  po-
tential terrestrial storage sites [312], as depicted in Fig. 46. A similar
correlation  and proximity exists between  fossil fuel power plants and
potential geological storage sites in Northern America [318].

Regional  capacities  for  CO2  storage  have  also  been  assessed  by
governmental and scientific organizations in the last decade [319]. The
results  of  this  study  indicated  that  there  is  ample  capacity  for  CO2
storage around the world, with North America, Brazil and China offering
the  largest  capacities  far  exceeding  1000  GtCO2.  However,  note  that
these  global  estimates  reflect  total  available  sizes,  but  the  actual
accessible  or  usable  capacities  that  are  economically  and  technically
feasible may be much less. With respect to source types, storage capacity
estimates for sedimentary basins range between 5,000 and 25,000 Gt of
CO2, saline aquifers can similarly accommodate 4,000 to 23,000 Gt of
CO2, and reservoirs for oil and petroleum, after full depletion, provide
about an additional capacity for 1000 Gt of CO2  [187]. Storage in the

void fraction of mineable and unmineable coal beds also offer the op-
portunity to extract the methane that is trapped in the pores of the coal
seams.  Indeed,  methane  extraction  from  coal  beds  by  CO2  has  been
successfully  used  in  practice  [320].  However,  despite  their  adequate
capacity, coal seams usually have low permeability. Furthermore, esti-
mation  of  their  potential  storage  capacity,  storage  integrity  and  reli-
ability, and environmental and safety concerns pose serious challenges.
Accordingly,  coal  bed  storage  is  generally  viewed  as  a  challenging
option.

Besides  storage  capacity  and  proximity  to  emission  source,  CCS
scenarios  also  require  consideration  of  the  storage  times  and  leakage
potential. The natural sequestration process of mineralization into car-
bonates provides long time frames for storage (of the order of 105 years)
and vast capacities approaching 105 GtCO2, albeit at slow uptake rates
[188]. Similarly, CO2  storage by absorption in oceans as carbonic acid
may  look  attractive,  but  it  trades  one  environmental  problem  with
another as acidification of the oceans by CO2  uptake acutely threatens
the marine ecosystem and coral life. Likewise, sequestration in biomass
such as afforestation and reforestation may be limited by growth rate,
time  scale  and  climatic  constraints.  So  it  is  generally  believed  that
sequestration in underground structures, formations and aquifers may
provide easier and more expedient route for long term storage of CO2. It
is also proposed [188] that perhaps another reliable way to store CO2
permanently  is  by  carbonization,  where  CO2  is  first  injected  into
geological
typically  contain
alkaline-based reactive minerals. The CO2 dissolves in the water trapped
in the pores of the rock formations. The acidified water leaches out the

formations,  such  as  basalt,

s  and  1990

The  first  commercial  CCS  project  that was  undertaken for  climate
mitigation was the Sleipner field in the North Sea 250 km off the shore of
Norway that is still in operation since 1996. Another early CCS project In
Salah that started about a decade ago in Algeria stopped its operations
recently.  Earlier  projects  between  the  1970
s  provided
reduction  in  CO2  emissions  but  did  not  target  CCS  specifically  for
climate mitigation purposes. There are several CCS projects already in
operation  (see  Table  16),  and  many  industrial  scale  CCS  projects  are
under various stages of development or construction in the U.S., Nor-
way,  Canada,  and  Australia.  Unfortunately,  the  stored  CO2  vol  (~  1
MtCO2/yr)  in  these  projects  are  clearly  several  orders  of  magnitude
lower than the annual emissions of nearly 37 GtCO2. Recent progress has
increased  the  global  capacity  for  carbon  capture  by  nearly  33%,
including the addition of 12 new commercial projects in North America
in 2020. Currently, there are 65 commercial CCS facilities under various
stages of development and completion around the world, and 26 that are
already  in  operation  capture  nearly  a  total  40  MtCO2  annually  [323,
324]. Again, this annual capacity falls far too short of making a dent in
mitigating the continued emissions of CO2 into the atmosphere.

The chain costs associated with CO2 sequestration are uncertain and
depend on many factors. Nevertheless, an early estimate had projected
that ~$30 per ton of CO2 may be achievable in the long term [188]. It
was also argued then that development of cost effective and reliable CCS
technologies would present a cheaper option than a rapid and complete
transition  from  fossil  fuel-based  power  generation  to  carbon-free
renewable  technologies.  As  expected,  the  cost  of  CCS  depends  on
many factors. For example, the total cost of CCS from coal-based inte-
grated  gasification  combined  cycle  (IGCC)  plant  is  estimated  to  be
around $4.5/tCO2 with the end use targeted for enhanced oil recovery,
while  CCS  from  a  natural  gas  combined  cycle  plant  with  long-term
storage of CO2 in saline formations may cost significantly much higher
at $72.4/tCO2 [92]. Variations in the cost of CCS are also valid for other
industrial processes such as iron and steel, cement, refinery, and pulp
and  paper,  where  cost  estimates  range  between  $30  and  $70/tCO2
depending on the industry [41].

Besides  geological  structures  and  underground  formations,  storing
CO2 deep on the ocean floor is another alternative for large-scale storage
[312]. Oceans offer enormous storing capacity and have absorbed more
than  600  GtCO2,  or  nearly  40%,  of  the  anthropogenic  CO2  emissions
since  the  industrial  revolution  [325].  They  cover  nearly  70%  of  the
world’s surface with an average depth of about 3800 m, and have served
as a major sink for removing CO2 from the atmosphere with an average
annual uptake rate of nearly 7 GtCO2.

CO2  sequestration in the ocean by reacting power plant flue gasses
with  seawater  followed  by  carbonate  dissolution  has  been  proposed
earlier  to  accelerate the  geological  time scales for  uptake and  also to
minimize the impact of otherwise increased acidity in the ocean [326,
327]. Alternatively, captured CO2  can be injected deep into the ocean
floor  to  depths  of  about  3000 m,  where  CO2  density  exceeds  that  of
seawater and sinks to the bottom. Injected CO2 can form solid CO2 hy-
drates or CO2 lakes on the seabed, and can thus be immobilized possibly
for centuries. However, this technology is not well understood yet, and

poses some risks. Increased CO2 content alters ocean chemistry and the
marine ecosystem. Dissolved CO2 increases ocean acidity (see Fig. 47),
which is implicated in the destruction of coral life and marine habitat.
Unlike  geological  storage,  however,  there  are  no  plausible  and
abrupt mechanisms for ocean storage that can cause catastrophic release
of  CO2  into  the  atmosphere.  On  the  other  hand,  gradual  release  may
certainly occur, partly due to ocean warming and also by mixing and
circulation by currents over centuries [329]. As sea temperatures rise
due to atmospheric heating, ocean’s buffer capacity for CO2 uptake will
decrease due to the reduced solubility of CO2 in warmer seawater. Many
of  these  outstanding  issues  and  knowledge  gaps  require  fundamental
understanding for the prospects of long term large-scale storage of CO2
at the ocean floor to gain comparable level of interest and momentum as
geological sequestration.

9. Downstream utilization and transformation of CO2

Although there is ample geological and deep sea capacity for CO2
storage as discussed in the previous section, the option of re-utilizing
CO2, at least in part, in industrial applications, or transforming it into
useful  chemicals  and  fuels  [36,38,330–335]  certainly  warrants  due
consideration  as  it  helps  reduce  the  amount  that  would  otherwise  be
emitted into the atmosphere. CO2  is a valuable source for carbon that
forms  the  backbone  of  wide  range  of  indispensible  industries  and
products including polymers and plastics, petrochemicals, pharmaceu-
ticals,  food  packaging,  beverage  industries,  refrigeration,  fire  extin-
guishers, synthetic fibers, and chemicals and fuels. As long as carbon
remains chemically bound in these products and materials during their
life cycles, it is effectively blocked from entering the atmosphere and
hence considered ‘chemically stored’. However, carbon life cycle con-
siderations  should  include  all  upstream  as  well  as  downstream  pro-
cesses, and not only focus on the final product. Although CO2 utilization
is not generally viewed as a game-changing strategy for emission miti-
gation,  it  nevertheless  helps  recycle  the  carbon  to  produce  useful
products,  especially  if  the  energy  input  is  supplied  from  a  renewable

source.  Dwarfed  by  the  vast  scale  of  CO2  emissions  [5],  we  are  also
severely limited by our global industrial capacity and in our ability to
channel  and  process  even  a  fraction  of  the  CO2  emissions  for
re-utilization and transformation purposes (see Table 3). Nevertheless,
development of cost effective and energy efficient technologies for CO2
conversion and utilization as a C1-building block for the production of
chemicals  and  fuels,  even  in  part,  certainly  offers  the  opportunity  to
close the carbon cycle and help reduce demand for long term storage of
CO2 [79]. Although not in volumes anywhere near emissions, there are a
variety of existing applications already commercialized that exploit the
chemical and physical properties of CO2.

9.1. Enhanced oil recovery

Currently,  the  largest  industrial  use  of  CO2  is  in  enhanced  oil  re-
covery (OER) applications, where CO2  is injected under pressure into
depleted or semi-depleted oil and gas reservoirs to force out the residual
fossil fuel trapped in the geological formations. EOR is a mature tech-
nology that has been widely used for many decades, and provides great
economic  benefits  to  the  oil  and  gas  industry,  but  most  fields  have
annual injection rates of only several MtCO2  [189]. Up to 40% of the
residual fossil fuel can be extracted by EOR, while the CO2  is perma-
nently trapped and stored in the reservoir. A recent study by the U.S.
National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) based on the possibility
of cost effective capture of 20 Gt of CO2  from power plants and other
industrial sources has estimated that nearly 67 billion barrels of oil can
be recovered from economically recoverable resources using EOR [336].
Achieving this goal requires major reduction in the cost of carbon
capture systems to approximately $40/Gt of CO2 captured at the plant
gate by the year 2025, excluding transportation and storage. Although
only 47 MtCO2  is annually employed worldwide for OER, a 2011 IEA
report estimated that implementation of state-of-the-art OER technology
in 50 of the world’s largest oil fields could produce 470 billion barrels of
additional oil and store 140 GtCO2 [337].

9.2. Other industrial applications

Aside  from  enhanced  oil  recovery  (EOR),  CO2  has  long  been
employed  in  many  industrial  scale  applications  including  sodas  and
other carbonated beverages, in fire extinguishers, as well as refrigera-
tion. More recent applications exploit its remarkable physical and sol-
vation  properties.  Liquid  CO2  has  very  low  viscosity  and  excellent
wetting  properties,  and  a  density  comparable  to  many  of  the  other
commonly  used  organic  solvents.  Similarly,  supercritical  CO2  is  an
excellent  solvent  and  employed  for  many  extraction  and  separation
processes in the food industry, and cleaning operations for the garment
(i.e., dry-cleaning) as well as the microelectronics industries. Both liquid
and  supercritical  CO2  are  considered  “green  solvents”  employed
increasingly  in  a  wide  range  of  industrial  applications  including
replacing  organic  solvents  for  precision  coatings  in  automotive  and
furniture manufacturing, polymer production and processing, biomed-
ical applications, catalysis, and decaffeinating coffee and tea [338].

9.3. CO2-to-fuels conversion

CO2  capture  and  utilization  (CCU)  complements  CCS  as  CO2  is  a
valuable  source  of  carbon  for  chemical  feedstocks  and  also  as  C1
building blocks for the production of high value C2  and higher hydro-
carbons  and fuels. Interestingly, the global market volume for hydro-
carbon  fuels  is  nearly  two  orders  of  magnitude  larger  than  that  for
chemicals, so CO2-to-fuels is an attractive goal and a qualified propo-
sition. Although this conversion process, depicted by the overall reac-
tion (20), is technically viable, it is highly energy intensive.

The conversion of CO2 into useful fuels accomplishes two objectives
simultaneously.  First,  it  recycles  CO2  and  transforms  it  into  a  useful
product that closes the carbon cycle. If energy from renewable or non-
carbon  sources  such  as  nuclear,  solar,  wind  or  hydrothermal  is
employed for this conversion, the process can also be carbon neutral.
Equally  important  is  the  fact  that  due  to  the  high  energy  density  of
hydrocarbons, CO2-to-fuels conversion also offers an effective means for
large-scale “energy storage” technology that is badly needed for utility-
scale renewable power, extending its efficacy from days to months for
the  electric  grid  [101].  Especially  liquid  fuels  are  convenient  and
portable energy carriers with high energy density, and are attractive for
a variety of energy production and storage applications. Table 17 sum-
marizes and compares the energy densities  of major liquid fuels with
battery storage and highlights their significant advantage.

CO2-to-fuels  conversion  can  be  considered  in  a  similar  realm  as
power-to-gas, power-to-liquid or power-to-X [335,339–342], and is ex-
pected to play a major role in storing electrical energy in the form of
fuels  such  as  hydrogen,  methane,  ammonia,  or  methanol,  and  useful
chemicals such as syngas (H2+CO), CO, or formate. While power-to-gas,
power-to-liquid  and  power-to-X  are  used  interchangeably  to  indicate
that  the  electrical  energy  for  these  conversion  processes  are  supplied
exclusively  by  renewable  sources,  CO2-to-fuels  concept  embraces  all
types of energy inputs. Although the costs of many power-to-gas pro-
cesses  such  as  water  electrolysis  and  methanation  are  predicted  to
decrease  75%  by  mid-century  [343],  techno-economic  and  life  cycle
assessments of many of the power-to-gas technological options indicated
that they still fall short of economically competing with conventional
gas production processes [38,344]. Feasibility of many power-to-gas or
-liquid  processes  is  quite  sensitive  to  the  price  and  availability  of
renewable power. A recent study concluded that for electrosynthesis of
fuels from CO2 using renewable power to be able to compete favorably
with  fossil  fuel-derived  synthesis  processes,  the  price  of  renewable
electricity  needs  to  fall  below  $0.04/kWh  and  the  electrochemical
conversion efficiency needs to be > 60% [345].

There are several thermal routes for CO2  re-use for the synthesis of
fuels and chemicals by partially reducing it to CO or C1  hydrocarbons,
including thermal catalytic conversion [346,347], solar thermal [348],
and  plasma  [349,350].  Also,  CO2  can  be  converted  to  hydrocarbons
directly  by  photocatalytic  [334,351,352],  electrochemical  [332,345,
353–355], or photoelectrochemical [356–358] pathways, or indirectly,
by  partial  reduction  first  to  CO  that  is  then  mixed  with  hydrogen  to
undergo  a  catalytic  conversion  process  to  produce  hydrocarbons  via
Fischer-Tropsch  (F-T)  synthesis.  The  F-T  process,  developed  in  the
1920
s  in  Germany  and  currently  employed  in  Sasol  plants  in  South

′

Africa,  is  an  established  and  mature  technology  that  allows  catalytic
conversion of CO-H2 mixtures typically of the CO:H2 ratio of 1:2 into a
wide range of hydrocarbons and liquid fuels [335,359–362].

As CO2 represents the lowest energy state in the C-O binary system, it
o = –396 kJ/mol). Any reaction
is chemically a very stable molecule (ΔGf
that involves its reduction is thermodynamically uphill with an energy
barrier of ~ 1 eV. Nevertheless, this energy barrier may be affected and
lowered by catalysis, and more so by electrocatalysis [109]. Indeed by
imposing a suitable potential bias from an external power source, elec-
trochemistry makes it possible to alter the energy profiles of reactions so
much  so  as  to  even  help  reverse  the  energy  barrier  for  a  thermody-
namically uphill reaction to a downhill gradient. This is the underlying
principle of many electrolysis and electrosynthesis reactions, as well as
electrowinning and electroplating processes.

The  first  demonstration  of  electrochemical  conversion  of  CO2
directly  into  methane  fuel  over  transition  metal  catalytic  electrodes
deposited on an oxide-ion conducting solid electrolyte yttria-stabilized
′
s  [363–365].  A  slight
zirconia  (YSZ)  was  reported  in  the  early  1980
variant of this electrochemical approach was proposed for life support
systems that directly dissociated CO2 for oxygen recovery [364–368] or
simultaneously generated oxygen and methane from CO2/H2O mixtures
using a solid state electrochemical reactor [369,370]. It was also pro-
posed  that  the  reaction  mechanism  for  the  high  temperature  electro-
chemical  conversion  of  CO2  to  methane  involved  surface  CO  as  the
intermediary,  and  the  rate-determining  step  was  the  dissociative  hy-
drogenation of the adsorbed CO [363,365]. The results further indicated
that  electrochemical  stripping  of  oxygen  sequentially  from  adsorbed
CO2  and CO has enhanced the turnover frequency of the methanation
◦
reaction by nearly two orders of magnitude at 650
C and the reaction
rate  constants  exhibited  strong  dependence  on  the  externally  applied
potential that drove the uphill reaction.

Interestingly,  the  generally  accepted  stepwise reaction  mechanism
currently accepted for room temperature electrochemical reduction of
CO2 also involves CO as the intermediary [353]. From a practical point
of view, there are obvious advantages accomplishing CO2 reduction at or
around  room  temperature,  including  the  chemical  stability  of  higher
hydrocarbons,  which  are  unstable  at  elevated  temperatures,  avoiding
large thermal loads required for high temperature electrolytic reduction
of CO2, and employing water-based electrolytes as the H2 source for the
hydrogenation reaction of CO2 to hydrocarbons.

Copper has emerged as the most preferred room temperature elec-
trocatalyst  for  CO2  reduction,  because  of  its  exceptional  ability  to
catalyze the conversion of CO2  to wide range of chemicals and hydro-
carbons.  Indeed,  since  the  first  demonstration  of  room  temperature
electrochemical reduction of CO2 on Cu electrocatalyst [353,371], there
has  been  intense  activity  for  low  temperature  electrochemical  routes
[353,372–374]. A recent study demonstrated the highest turnover fre-
(cid:0) 1  (corresponding to partial current den-
quency of 4.3 s
sities  of  132  and  84  A/m2)  respectively  for  the  electrochemical
conversion of CO2 to methane and ethylene on a Cu-porphyrin electro-
catalyst in aqueous electrolyte [375].

(cid:0) 1  and 1.8 s

For  CO2  mitigation  purposes,  it  should  be  noted  that  the  electro-
chemical  conversion  of  CO2  to  useful  chemicals  and  fuels  becomes
meaningful and impactful only if renewable electricity is employed for
this process. Besides electrolytic conversion, other pathways involving
room  temperature  photocatalytic  and  photoelectrochemical  reduction
of CO2 to methanol and other hydrocarbons have also been reported in
recent  articles  and  reviews  [376–380].  Obviously,  there  is  clear
advantage in utilizing solar energy for CO2  reduction and conversion.
Most  of  these  photon-based  approaches  employ  aqueous  electrolytes,
but  exhibit  low  conversion  efficiency,  current  density,  and  selectivity
values.

CO2  electrolyzers  also  exhibit  high  polarization  losses  due  to  the
sluggish  rates  for  the  CO2  reduction  and  oxygen  evolution  reaction
(OER)  at  the  cathode  and  anode,  respectively.  They  usually  operate
under high cell potentials in excess of 2 V with modest current densities

Fig.  48. Comparison  of  energy  efficiency  and  current  densities  for  the  elec-
trolytic  conversion  of  CO2  into  formic  acid,  syngas,  and  hydrocarbons  (pri-
marily, methane and ethylene) in aqueous electrolyte containing electrolyzers.
Efficiencies of the alkaline and PEM electrolyzers reflect total system level ef-
ficiency, while efficiencies for CO2  conversion include only the cathode losses
while  neglecting  anode  and  other  system  losses.  Reprinted  from  [372]  with

and energy conversion efficiencies of 25% to 50% [345]. Fig. 48 sum-
marizes the results from eighteen different studies, and maps the prod-
uct distribution and conversion efficiencies obtained on various cathode
materials [372]. It is clear that these low (or, room) temperature elec-
trochemical methods offer only moderate efficiencies and require large
overvoltages to drive the CO2 reduction and oxygen evolution reactions.
Even at a modest current density of 50 A/m2, the CO2  reduction over-
potentials for most metal cathodes are around 1 V, and for Cu cathode it
is 0.9 V for the CO2 to CO reaction and 1.2 V for CO2 to methane [353].
Hence, development of improved electrocatalysts with well-defined and
controlled microstructures is needed to reduce electrode overvoltages
and  render  this  electrochemical  approach  more  suitable  for  practical
considerations.  The  low  solubility  of  CO2  in  aqueous  electrolytes  is
another  limiting  factor.  Non-aqueous  electrolytes  offer  significantly
higher solubility for CO2 than their aqueous counterparts. For example,
dimethyl-formamide can dissolve more than 20 times more CO2 than the
same  quantity  of  aqueous  solutions,  while  propylene  carbonate  can
provide 8 times more solubility for CO2 [380].

The reaction mechanisms for CO2 reduction and conversion in liquid
electrolytes are complex [378], and not well understood. The product
distribution, or selectivity, and reaction pathways depend upon many
process  variables,  and  strongly  on  catalytic  properties  and  catalyst
microstructure of the cathode [353]. Design and control of surface fac-
eting  and  nanostructure  of  the  catalytic  cathode  material  profoundly
impact the selectivity and product distribution of CO2 reduction. These
challenges make it difficult to control product selectivity for the desired
fuel.  On  the  practical  side,  gas  bubbling  due  to  evolution  reaction  in
liquid electrolyte cells also poses efficiency and performance losses due
to increased resistance of the electrolyte, blockage of catalytic surfaces
by bubble formation and disruption to heat and mass transfer by rising
bubbles. More research is needed to address and overcome these tech-
nical barriers. Also, scaling up these processes to quantities meaningful
for CO2 mitigation measures is yet to be demonstrated. Developing these
advanced technologies for cost effective conversion of CO2 to fuels still
remains a desirable goal, albeit with major challenges.

It  is  important  to  note  that  CO2  utilization  may  only  complement
mitigation  at  best.  It  cannot  and  should  not  be  considered  as  a
replacement  or  alternative  to  storage.  Indeed,  an  earlier  IPCC  report

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience89(2022)10096543

T.M. Gür

[312]  had  suggested  that  CO2  utilization  may  not  make  a  significant
dent  in  reducing  atmospheric  emissions.  Similarly,  a  more  recent  life
cycle analysis on the environmental impact of CCS and CCU reported
that the global warming potential (GWP) of CCS was estimated at 276
kgCO2eq/tCO2 removed, which was 215 times lower than the GWP of 59,
400  kgCO2eq/tCO2  for  CCU  for  the  production  of  a  chemical  such  as
dimethylcarbonate  [94].  Nevertheless,  integrating  CO2  utilization  to
renewable  energy  sources  offers  a  promising  pathway  to  utilize  this
valuable carbon source and close the carbon cycle for the production of
useful materials, chemical feedstocks, fuels, and products.

Incidentally,  there  is  a  useful  resource  to  asses  the  feasibility  and
environmental viability of CCU processes that may greatly benefit from
life cycle analysis tools, namely, the NETL CO2U LCA Guidance Toolkit,
recently  developed and  provided  through the  U.S. Department  of En-
ergy,  National  Energy  Technology  Laboratory  (NETL)  website  [381].
The toolkit provides data, resources and modeling, as well as guidance
and templates to funding recipients in performing life cycle analyses for
evaluating the environmental impact of CO2 utilization ideas.

10. Pricing carbon

Mitigation measures incentivizing reductions in CO2  emissions also
require placing a price on carbon. This can be an effective policy tool to
promote investment and accelerate progress in decarbonizing the global
energy systems. In fact, many have viewed carbon pricing to be the most
effective tool to curb CO2 emissions and also serve as the cornerstone for
climate  policies  [382].  However,  assessing  and  assigning  a  price  on
carbon emissions is a complex problem that involves societal, economic,
policy, environmental and technical components. It is also important to
understand  the  social  costs  of  carbon  and  how  climate  policies  may
impact the economy [383].

The “price” or “fee” placed on CO2  emissions also needs to be fair,
transparent and uniform in its implementation. Otherwise there is a risk
that some emitters may get a free ride on the sincere mitigation efforts of
others,  or  heavy  polluters  may  relocate  to  regions  where  the  carbon

price is low [384]. There are also geographic and structural differences
and variations across the globe in implementing the carbon price. There
are  some  regions  like  California  in  the  U.S.  as  well  as  some  nations,
especially in Europe, have been practicing cap-and trade for many years.
There are few others like Northern European countries including Nor-
way, Finland, and Denmark that implement a tax on carbon emissions.
The variation of different forms of carbon pricing either implemented, in
planning or scheduled are mapped in Fig. 49, which also indicates that
large parts of the world have yet to take action.

It should be noted that the global emissions covered under the car-
bon  tax  initiatives  potentially  amounted  to  3  GtCO2e  in  2020,  which
corresponded to only 5.6% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions,
while those covered under emission traded schemes (ETS) or cap-and-
trade  targeted  9  GtCO2e  (or,  17%  of  global  GHG),  for  a  total  of  12
GtCO2e or 22.3% of the global GHG emissions [385]. In reality, however,
only a total of 9 GtCO2e (or, 16% of global GHG) of the 12 GtCO2e has
actually  been  implemented  in 2020.  Nevertheless, there  is agreement
that pricing carbon may work well for some sectors and industries with
large volume point source emissions such as electric power generation,
fertilizer production and cement or steel manufacturing, while pricing is
difficult  to  implement  for  the  transportation  sector  and  agro-food
industries.

On  the  other  hand,  the  skeptics  argue  that  carbon  pricing  has
inherent problems and most likely, its implementation may not be suf-
ficient to curb emissions and mitigate climate change [384]. It addresses
only  a  small  fraction  (~16%)  of  the  global  emissions.  Assessing  the
regional impact of the carbon price may also be complicated by external
factors. For example, should one tax the emitting plant, or its corporate
owner located in another state or country. Furthermore, the price for
carbon is naturally borne by all stakeholders in the chain including the
business and industrial sectors as well as the communities and nations,
albeit in varying degrees. It was argued that the cost of carbon pricing
unfairly burdens lower income people.  As a fraction of household in-
come, it was estimated that the lowest 10% income households in the U.
S. would end up paying nearly 3 times more in carbon tax than the upper

Fig. 49. Map of regional and national distribution of carbon pricing initiatives at various stages of planning and implementation across the globe, including carbon
tax and emission traded schemes (ETS) i.e., cap-and-trade [385].

10%  of  households  in  annual  income  [386].  This  is  because  carbon
emitting  activities  and  expenses  such  as  heating  and  transportation
make up a proportionately larger fraction of the total income of poor
families than rich households. Hence, fairness is an important consid-
eration.  Moreover,  the  price  of  carbon  should  be  sufficiently  high  to
serve as an effective deterrent. Currently, it is difficult to claim that this
is the case. Fig. 50 presents the widely varying price of carbon imple-
mented in various regions and countries around the world in the form of
tax or cap-and-trade schemes. It is clear that most of the prices lie below
$25/tCO2e, and many are even considerably lower at around $10/tCO2
to  $15/tCO2e  [385].  These  numbers  are  significantly  lower  than  the
actual cost of CCS as discussed in previous sections. So the current prices
on carbon fail to provide a strong incentive and motivation to capture
CO2  emissions.  This  poses  a  serious  problem  for  achieving  climate
◦
C  temperature  rise  target  set  by  the  2015
mitigation.  To  meet  the  2
Paris  Agreement,  the  2017  Report  of  the  High-Level  Commission  on
Carbon Prices [387] recommended implementing a price of $40/tCO2 to
$80/tCO2  by 2020, and $50/tCO2  to $100/tCO2  by 2030 to help close
the emissions gap. It was argued that voluntary measures for CCS will
not work but enforced policies will, and simply pricing carbon may also
be insufficient to incentivize decarbonization of the energy sector and
deploy CCS at large scale, especially if the price of carbon is set too high
that penalizes the economy not just the fossil fuel-based electrical power
sector [46]. The low price of carbon implemented in some form in select
countries covers only a small fraction of global emissions, and this low
pricing  is  sometimes  viewed  as  permission  to  pollute  [388].  These
considerations highlight the challenges for the global community and
the importance of correct assessment for a fair, transparent and uniform
price for carbon.

11. Assessments and outlook

Strong dependence of our energy systems on fossil fuels is the pri-
mary culprit for CO2 emissions. Hence, massive adoption of renewable
sources is critically important for climate mitigation, but it may not be
sufficient  to  achieve  total  decarbonization  of  global  energy  systems
[21].  The  sources  of  CO2  emissions  across  the  planet  range  from,  to
name a few, forest and wildfires, to transportation vehicles, to building
heating and cooling systems, to power generation plants, to industrial

processes  such  as  iron  and  steel,  cement,  fermentation,  etc.  Some  of
them are large volume point emission sources, some are distributed, and
yet some others, such as wildfires, preside over vastly large areas that
make  it  impossible  to  collect  and  capture  CO2.  Such  diversity  in  the
locations, modes, volumes, compositions, and origins of CO2 emissions
demand  equally  diverse  technologies,  processes,  methodologies  and
policies for CCS. There is no single technology that has the ability, ca-
pacity  or  maturity  to  address  the  multitudes  of  challenges  posed  by
large-scale CCS from all these emission sources. Hence, a multi-prong
approach  to  CCS  is  essential  for  climate  mitigation,  in  the  same
manner that we need a diverse portfolio of energy production and en-
ergy storage technologies for both practical and energy security reasons
[101].  With  impending  and  growing  risks  of  climate  change,  it is  ur-
gently  imperative  to  develop  a  rich  portfolio  of  CCS  technologies  to
address large-scale CO2  capture. Many of the major CCS technologies,
processes, and materials have been discussed and reviewed in the pre-
sent article. With each passing year without any significant global action
taken at-scale, the task of achieving the emission reduction goal of 25
GtCO2e  by 2030 set out by the UN Emissions Gap Report of 2019 [11]
becomes  more  daunting  and  costly,  and  the  required  reduction  rates
demand more steep cuts as depicted in Fig. 51. For example, if we had
started global emission cutting efforts back in 2010, we would have to
reduce emissions by only 3.3 per year until 2030. If we started last year
in 2020, it would have required annual reductions of 7.6% to achieve the
2030 emissions target of 25 GtCO2e. If we continue to procrastinate until
2025, the required annual reductions increase to 15.4%, which is a tall
order for the world to meet. In other words, it will be significantly more
expensive to wait.

Decarbonization of the energy economy and commensurate reduc-
tion of CO2 emissions clearly point to rapid transformation of the global
energy  system  to  renewable  energy  sources,  which  have  low  carbon
intensities  (or,  CO2  footprint  per  unit  of  energy).  Indeed,  Table  18
summarizes the carbon intensities of renewable, nuclear and fossil fuel-
based power generation sources that were reported by IPCC [389] via
life  cycle  analysis  (LCA),  indicating  the  significant  advantage  of
renewable power sources as well as nuclear when compared with fossil
fuel-based power generation. Barring its nuclear waste problem, nuclear
energy is the only carbon-free option to provide base-load electricity.

marine  are  not  stand-alone,  dispatchable  energy  sources  but  instead
require  integration  with  adequate  energy  storage  capacities.  Li-ion
rechargeable  batteries  emerged  to  become  the  preferred  electricity
storage systems widely employed today. However, life cycle analysis of
Li-ion  battery-based  storage  indicates  that  1 kWh  of  storage  capacity
requires an energy expenditure of 400 kWh over the 20-year life time of
battery  storage,  resulting  in  emissions  of  75  kgCO2  (or  75,000

intensity of 1 kWh of Li-ion battery storage to be 110 kgCO2 (or 110,000
kgCO2/MWh)[393]. The results suggest that renewable storage is nearly
100 times higher in carbon intensity than fossil fuel-based power gen-
eration, which negates the advantage of renewable energy presented in
Table 18.

When  assessing  the  impact  of  energy  technology  options,  it  is
therefore important to consider the energy penalty and CO2  emissions
along the entire value chain of energy systems, devices and technologies
in choosing the most environmentally friendly, cost effective and effi-
cient option. In that regard, net energy analysis may be an effective tool
to  account  for  carbon,  assess  sustainability  and  verify  the  impact  of
energy and climate policies on the society, environment, economy and
climate [392]. For example, it was estimated that the return of energy
investment in wind power would return 80 times the energy consumed
for  manufacturing  over  its  lifetime,  while  solar  photovoltaic  power
returns only 10 times due to its significantly higher manufacturing cost
[393].  Regardless,  however,  utility-scale  deployment  of  renewable
sources to completely displace and replace fossil fuel-based energy and
power systems is in part constrained by the current state of the global
electrical  grid,  but  it  is  also  constrained  by  the  availability  of  cost
effective, scalable, efficient, and reliable energy storage options. In other
words,  utility  scale  energy  storage  technologies  with  discharge

capacities ranging over several decades of time scales from sub-minutes
to hundreds of hours must be developed aggressively to overcome the
inherently  intermittent,  variable,  unpredictable  and  nondispatchable
nature of most renewable energy sources [101,392,394].

There is also uncertainty if 100% renewables-based energy economy
is achievable, or even realistic. Claims of total decarbonization of the
global energy economy by banking on 100% renewable sources [18,19]
were met with skepticism and viewed not to be realistic for complete
elimination of CO2 emissions [20,21]. Although efficiency improvement
measures  and  moving  away  from  coal-fired  power  generation  are  ex-
pected to help lower the global carbon (and also, energy) intensity (see
Fig. 52), world’s energy-related CO2 emission is still expected to grow at
an annual rate of 0.6% through 2050 [26]. Hence, rapid development
and deployment of cost effective and energy efficient CCS technologies
still presents an urgent need to curb atmospheric CO2 levels and mitigate
climate change for a sustainable future.

Some  of  the  primary  components  along  the  CCS  process  chain,
including CO2  separation and capture, compression for transport, and

finally  storage,  are  commercially  available,  and  some  are  still  under
development with varying energy penalties and cost estimates that are
site or process specific. Although there is sufficient industrial experience
with many of the individual components in the process chain, for any
CCS pathway to be economically viable and widely deployed at a scale
commensurate  with  the  volume  of  CO2  emissions,  systems  level  inte-
gration of its components is essential. Unfortunately, industrial experi-
ence with integration of the CCS chain is lacking at the gigaton scale.

In  its  2014  report,  the  United  Nations  Environment  Programme
(UNEP)  had  considered  the  most  cost-effective  scenarios  to  curb  CO2
emissions based on several assumptions, namely, 1) all countries begin
mitigation  measures  immediately,  2) there  is  a  single  global price  on
carbon, and 3) all key technologies are available [395]. The UNEP report
indicated that limiting the greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmo-
sphere  to  around  450  ppmv  CO2e  clearly  quantifies  the  momentous
challenge  of reducing emissions by a  factor of nearly two in order  to

have a chance to stay within the 1.5 to 2.0
pre-industrial levels. Similarly, IPCC studied the technological options
to limit atmospheric CO2 concentrations not to exceed 450 to 530 ppmv
by  2100  [396].  Many  different  technologies  and  their  CO2  emission
intensities  have  been  analyzed  for  their  impact  on  atmospheric  CO2
concentrations as well as the resulting cost of electricity, which increases
with implementation of CCS as expected. Their 2014 analyses predicted
that utility scale solar PV and wind would compete favorably with fossil
fuel-based  power,  which  recently  became  true  indeed  [397].  Even
though fuel cell power generation is inherently highly efficient and of-
fers competitive cost of electricity (see Fig. 24 above), the IPCC 2014
report did not give any consideration to this promising technology op-
tion  for  power  production.  More  importantly,  CO2  can  readily  be
captured from fuel cell power plants without post separation operations
and eliminate the need for parasitic power demand for separation.

In this regard, this author believes it is imperative to initiate efforts
to transition the conventional fossil fuel-based power generation tech-
nologies  from  air-based  to  oxygen-based  advanced,  efficient  power
generation that also offer capture-ready production of CO2 flue streams,
as discussed above in this article [22]. All credible projections provided
in  this  article  clearly  indicate  that  fossil  fuels  are  expected  to  play  a
major  role  in  the  global  energy  mix  well  into  the  foreseeable  future.
Although their share in electricity generation will decrease, the amount
of fossil fuel use actually will continue to increase (see Figs. 4 and 5).
China (~28% of global emissions) has already surpassed the U.S. (~15%
of global emissions) as the largest CO2  emitter, and while investing in
renewables  also  makes  large  investments  in  fossil  fuel  based  power
generation. China also is investing heavily in its Belt and Road Initiative
that involves building nearly 140 coal-fired power plants across Asia and
Eurasia. For all the reasons discussed and reviewed in the present article,
it is too risky to stick with conventional air-based combustion technol-
ogies for power generation as if that is the permanently ingrained law of
the land. This needs to change. Implementing a global, fair and uniform
price for carbon emissions will help incentivize private investments and

transitioning

By  its  nature,  CCS  is  a  multi-faceted,  complex  and  arguably  an
existential  technology  that  is  intimately  interlinked  with  and  conse-
quential to almost every human activity on this planet. Regardless of the
choice  of  particular  CCS  technology,  materials  or  systems  under
consideration,  all  have  their  advantages  and  shortcomings,  and  all
require vast amounts of energy for CCS. Equally important is the fact
that all options suffer also from knowledge gaps and experience espe-
cially in scaling up at least some of these CCS options to multi-gigaton
CO2 per year capacity (see Table 3).

As discussed extensively in this article, major barriers to CCS are the
cost and high energy penalty of capturing CO2 from flue streams and to
compress  it  further  for  transportation  and  storage.  Among  the  many
technological options for CO2  capture discussed in this article, amine-

based  solvent  scrubbing  has  gained  the  most  interest  in  practice,
partly because it is a commercial technology that is already employed
for  gas  cleanup  in  industrial  applications.  Similar  to  other  options,
however,  amine-based  CO2  capture  is  also  an  energy  intensive  and
expensive  process.  The  minimum  theoretical  work  required  for  CO2
capture  using  amine  solvents  followed  by  compression  to  15 MPa  is
estimated to be around 420 MJ/tCO2, where more than half of this en-
ergy penalty is due to the CO2 recovery step during solvent regeneration,
and the remaining is consumed during the compression process [216].
Effective integration of thermal processes, such as solvent regeneration
during post-combustion CO2 capture with fossil fuel-based power plants
is an important consideration to improve overall efficiency, but this is
also impacted adversely by the humidity content of the inlet flue stream
[80]. Hence, dehumidifying the flue gas stream before the CO2 capture
step  helps  lower  the  energy  burden,  contactor  area,  and  capital  cost.
Although there is an energy penalty of 8% to 12% for oxy-combustion
due primarily to separating oxygen from air [113,131], this technology
offers not only reduced SOx and NOx emissions and ease of capture for
CO2  but also higher plant efficiency and a lower threshold for retrofit-
ting oxy-combustion into existing fossil fuel-based power plants.

Direct  air  capture,  certainly  a  costly  and  highly  energy  intensive
option, is considered not only to complement CCS policies but also as a
potential countermeasure to capture CO2  emissions from uncontrolled
events such as coal mine fires, forest fires, and wildfires, or distributed
sources such as transportation vehicles, or leakages from CO2  storage
sites.  Arguably,  direct  air  capture  presents  technically  the  most  chal-
lenging  option  in  mitigating  CO2  emissions.  Although  there  is  com-
mercial  interest  in  this  nascent  approach,  the  future  prospects  of
developing and adopting DAC widely at the gigaton scale remains un-
certain. To achieve negative emissions, its success may rely on the use of
non-carbon energy sources such as renewables and nuclear to meet the
high energy demand for DAC.

Although CO2  utilization does  not seem  to have  the  magnitude of
scale in gigatons, it nevertheless provides a valuable carbon source for
the synthesis and manufacturing of a wide range of materials, chemical,
fuels  and  products  routinely  needed  and  utilized  by  the  global  com-
munity. Using CO2 as the C1 building block also helps close the carbon
cycle by recycling it back into useful products instead of deriving the
required carbon from fossil fuel sources.

The  low  hanging  fruit  of  increasing  the  efficiency  of  energy  pro-
duction, conversion and storage processes is also a critically important
consideration for CO2 mitigation. Advanced power generation technol-
ogies such as renewables and fuel cells to increase both the production
and end-use efficiency of electricity generation provides additional op-
tions to compensate for the energy penalty paid during carbon capture
and storage process. It was estimated that increasing the electrical ef-
ficiency by a modest 15% to 20% would suffice to make up the power
that would be expanded for CCS [106].

As recommended by the 2019 UN Emission Gap Report [11] for full
decarbonization  especially  of  the  energy  and  transportation  sectors,
rapid  electrification  across  various  energy  sectors  while  phasing  out
fossil  fuels  is  another  viable  strategy  to  curb  CO2  emissions.  This  in-
volves shifting most industrial processes towards electricity, decarbon-
izing  building  heating  and  cooling  systems  via  electrification  and
efficiency  enhancements,  agricultural  measures
from
animal-based  to  plant-based  food  sources,  net-zero  deforestation  pol-
icies  to  protect  natural  ecosystems,  and  restoration  and  reforestation
measures to improve land carbon stocks for increased CO2 uptake.

to  shift

It is likely that technical efforts towards full decarbonization of the
energy economy by the end of this century may fall short of addressing
the atmospheric CO2  problem alone. Given the largest carbon flux be-
tween  land  and  the  atmosphere  of  nearly  440  GtCO2/yr  occurs  via
photosynthesis  [73],  large  scale  exploitation  and  management  of  the
terrestrial biosphere and the biological carbon cycle including affores-
tation and reforestation, land and marine biota, as well as mineralization
and rock weathering, animal husbandry, food supply chains are fertile

areas to make large-scale impact on CO2 mitigation strategies.

Even  though  fair  assessment  of  carbon  pricing  is  challenging,  it
nevertheless  conveys  and  represents  the  cumulative  external  costs  of
climate mitigation for all stakeholders. It also educates the public, in-
dustry and policy makers and brings to fore the urgency of addressing
imminent danger of catastrophic climate change, and implement mea-
sures to integrate decarbonization strategies and programs into action-
able  policies.  So  carbon  pricing  should  be  considered  as  part  of  the
overall  mix  of  measures  and  policies  that  promote  reduction  in  CO2
emissions and innovation carbon capture technologies.

Most  of  the  technologies  and  processes  discussed  in  the  present
article  are  not  yet  ready  for  commercial  implementation,  with  the
exception of several including oxy-combustion, IGCC and amine-based
solvent  scrubbing  of  CO2.  Even  then,  several  amine  scrubbing,  IGCC,
and  oxy-combustion  projects  have  failed  to  demonstrate  economic
viability [158,160]. Some have abandoned their carbon capture activity
[398].  The  barriers  to  commercialization  are  complex  but  mostly
economical, technical and political in nature. Cost is still a big issue, and
unless  major  incentives  are  provided,  private  industry  will  shy  away
from  shouldering  the  risks  alone.  Technical  barriers  are  multiple  and
each  particular technology  poses many challenges yet  to be resolved.
Political barriers across the globe failed to forge a unified and urgent
response to mitigate climate change. Unfortunately, these issues paint a
rather bleak outcome, and in all likelihood, the world may not be able to
comply with the IPCC guidelines [399] to cut CO2 emissions by 55% by
◦
the year 2030 in order to limit global warming to within 1.5
C [12,13].
Unfortunately,  economic  arguments  have  often  dominated  and
diverted the public discourse away from the ultimate goal of avoiding
imminent  risks  to  life  on  planet  Earth.  In  general,  the  global  public
opinion is far ahead of the world’s governments, who in large part have
failed  to  demonstrate  the  political  will  and  the  commitment  to  enact
investments commensurate with the massive volumes required for CCS.
It is likely an even bigger price will have to be paid later if the world
continues to delay aggressive action and collective implementation of
◦
effective  CCS  policies  to  limit  the  temperature  rise  to  within  1.5
C.
Indeed,  it  is  more  expensive  to  do  nothing  now.  Impact  of  climate
change  on  food  production  and  supplies,  displacement  of  large  pop-
ulations due to sustained draft and water shortages, flooding and loss of
land along low lying coastal regions by rising sea levels are plausible
scenarios of existential consequences.

To  illustrate the immense  price of little  or no  action now but pay
more  later,  consider  the  impact  of  climate  change  on  global  commu-
nities in both direct and hidden costs. Between 1980 and 2018, the U.S.
has suffered 241 climate-related natural disasters that caused more than
$1 billion in damages per incident, for a total loss of 13,188 lives and
cumulative cost of more than $1.6 trillion, or more than $42 billion per
year [400]. More recently, the average price tag for natural disasters in
the U.S. totaled to more than $99 billion annually between 2014 and
2018. By contrast, the most recent fiscal year 2021 (FY2021) allocation
for  basic  energy research  funding for the  U.S. DOE  Office  of Science,
Basic Energy Sciences was $2.25 billion [401]. Similarly, the cumulative
totals  for  all  energy  related  federal  funding  in  the  U.S.  has  been
reasonably  steady  around  $3  billion  to  $4  billion  annually,  which  is
nearly 3% of the annual damages caused by natural disasters. This stark
comparison and large discrepancy represents a ‘pay now or pay more
later’  choice.  Obviously,  basic  research  is  not  capable  of  solving  all
problems natural or man-made, but it will guide and provide techno-
logical options to solve pressing societal and global problems. Given the
intimate interaction and interdependence of energy and climate change
(see  Fig.  2),  this  raises  the  question  if  enough  investments  are  being
wisely  made  by  policy  makers  to  support  development  of  advanced
technologies  to  address energy and climate  change  issues collectively
and strategically.

As  pointed  out  in  a  recent  U.S.  National  Academies  workshop
regarding deep decarbonization of economies [402], technology options
for rapid commercialization and deployment of CO2 capture and storage

are burdened with technical, environmental, financial, policy, and social
challenges.  This  high  degree  of  complexity  and  uncertainty  naturally
increases  investment  risks  and  also  hinders  development  efforts.  For
sure, the road to commercial CCS technologies is riddled with difficult
challenges and choices. Furthermore, lack of a globally agreed uniform
pricing structure on carbon makes any commercial undertaking politi-
cally and financially risky. The enormous magnitude, complexity, and
the time line of the problem makes it difficult for private sector to invest
heavily  in  emerging  technologies  that  complement  renewables,
including fuel cells for efficient power generation from fossil fuels with
capture-ready CO2  production. Such economic and technological risks
are certainly higher than private investments can bear. So federal pro-
grams, incentives, and assistance across the globe are needed to lower
the hurdles and gain better insight in overcoming the technical and cost
barriers for CCS.

12. Key challenges and opportunities

CCS clearly faces a diverse range of challenges on all fronts, ranging
from policy and regulatory issues, to financial and economic, to climate
and  environment,  to  quality  of  life  and  health,  to  social  and  income
inequalities, and global agreement on a fair and sound strategy to deal
with  mitigation.  On  the  technical  side,  the  diversity  of  technologies,
processes, and materials along the CCS and CCU chains present addi-
tional hurdles, knowledge gap and challenges that require fundamental
research  and  understanding  as  well  as  engineering  solutions  to  over-
come them. Although many of these issues are addressed and discussed
under their respective sections, some of the more visible challenges are
grouped and summarized below in random order:

-  Advances  in  functional  materials  that  offer  superior  properties
ranging from more efficient and cost-effective separation of oxygen
from  air and  CO2  from  flue  gas  streams,  to novel  liquid  and  solid
sorbents  that  offer  higher  CO2  uptake  capacity  with  less  environ-
mental impact are needed to expand the technology options for CCS.
-  Fundamental understanding of CO2-sorbent interactions and control
of surface binding processes that govern preferential uptake of CO2
from flue gasses will expedite progress in designing advanced ma-
terials with superior sorption properties.

-  Theoretical simulations will advance fundamental understanding of
binding mechanisms at the atomic scale as well as expedite materials
screening and selection processes.

-  Similarly,  implementation  of  advanced  materials  processing  tools
and  techniques  to  tune,  modify  and  alter  materials  properties  by
nanostructuring  and  control  of  microstructure  will  help  improve
desired properties critical for removing CO2 from gaseous streams.
-  Development of non-aqueous solvents with higher CO2  affinity will

help improve uptake capacity.

- Development  of  scalable,  stable  and  environmentally  benign  sol-
vents,  sorbents  and  processes  for  CO2  capture  will  help  lower  the
threshold for social and political barriers for global implementation
of CCS at large scale.

-  Pre-combustion and post-combustion capture both suffer from heavy

energy penalties.

-  Direct air capture (DAC) demands the highest energy penalty, and is
arguably the most costly, but still deserves attention as it removes
CO2  from the atmosphere regardless of the origin, nature or geog-
raphy  of  the  emission  source.  Advances  in  materials  and  solvents
made for post-combustion capture will also benefit DAC greatly.
-  Improving  efficiencies  of  individual  steps  along  the  combustion-
power generation-CCS process chain will help reduce emissions as
well as the financial, technical and energy burden of CO2 capture.
-  Coupling  renewable  energy  sources  and  fuel  cells  into  the  power
generation-CCS process chain will also help lower the energy penalty
of CCS.

- Developing earth abundant catalysts and understanding of elemen-
tary  mechanisms  of  CO2  reduction  on  catalytic  surfaces  to  higher
hydrocarbons and fuels will enable utilization and recycling of this
valuable carbon source to make useful products.

-  The magnitude of CCS is enormous in terms of volumes required in
the tens of gigatons scale. This is at a scale unlike the industrial ca-
pacities ever built before. This endeavor will require a different en-
gineering  approach  to  meet  the  unprecedented  magnitude  of  the
problem.

-  CCS  is  an  expensive  proposition  and  currently  the  cost  for  CCS  is
generally much higher than most of the cap-and-trade prices or taxes
on  carbon.  Even  with  regulation,  this  imbalance  encourages  in-
dustries  to  elect  the  lower  cost  to  pollute  and  emit,  and  does  not
provide the necessary incentive for industries, governments and the
private sector to invest in developing technological solutions. This
loophole must be plugged.

-  Pricing  carbon  emissions  is  certainly  an  effective  deterrent,  but
placing a fair, equitable, and uniform price agreeable to citizens and
governments of the global community is also a complex and politi-
cally complicated problem with many potholes.

-  Climate change is arguably an existential challenge and inaction is

the most expensive choice we can make.

13. Summary

This  overview  covers  and  reviews  a  broad  range  of  technologies,
processes and materials for carbon capture and storage (CCS) as well as
utilization, and critically examines their technological, economic, and
environmental  merits.  The  urgency  and  consequential  importance  of
CO2  mitigation  is  stressed.  Wide-ranging  technologies  towards  decar-
bonization of fossil fuel-based power generation with full carbon capture
are discussed. Mature as well as emerging technological options both for
CO2  capture  and  sequestration  towards  long  term  storage,  as  well  as
utilization of CO2  are assessed. Although there seems to be more than
sufficient capacity for CO2 storage around the world, persistent political
and economic hurdles, knowledge gaps, and lack of industrial experi-
ence  in  large  scale  and  long  term  CO2  storage  and  sequestration  in
geological structures hinder rapid progress and implementation.

As  expected,  all  options  for  CCS  are  energy  intensive  and  carry  a
price tag. There is no silver bullet, no single technology to resolve the
climate  mitigation  problem.  The  quantities  involved  in  CCS  are  also
massive and far exceed our current industrial capacities. The diversity of
the compositions, volumes, locations and types of CO2  emissions also
preclude singular solutions. Hence a multi-prong strategy is required to
rapidly  address  the  impending  risk  of  irreversible  climate  change.
Multiple  technology  options  need  to  be  explored,  developed  at  the
gigaton-scale and rapidly deployed to address this arguably existential
challenge to the wellbeing of the ecosystem of our planet. As this multi-
dimensional problem is a highly risky endeavor for the private sector to
take on alone, federal governments around the globe need to step in and
lower the risk barriers.

Among all technological options, amine-based chemical absorption
is commercially more mature and provide comparatively a lower com-
mercial barrier for CO2  capture, albeit not without its own economic,
environmental,  and  technical  challenges.  On  the  other  hand,  oxygen-
based combustion, pre-combustion and fuel cell-based energy conver-
sion  processes  discussed  in  this  article  offer  alternative  solutions  by
eliminating the need for CO2 separation from flue gas streams.
