The understanding of soot formation in combustion processes and the optimization of practical com-
bustion systems require in situ measurement techniques that can provide important characteristics, such
as particle concentrations and sizes, under a variety of conditions. Of equal importance are techniques
suitable for characterizing soot particles produced from incomplete combustion and emitted into the en-
vironment. Additionally, the production of engineered nanoparticles, such as carbon blacks, may benefit
from techniques that allow for online monitoring of these processes.

In this paper, we review the fundamentals and applications of laser-induced incandescence (LII) for
particulate diagnostics in a variety of fields. The review takes into account two variants of LII, one that
is based on pulsed-laser excitation and has been mainly used in combustion diagnostics and emissions
measurements, and an alternate approach that relies on continuous-wave lasers and has become in-
creasingly popular for measuring black carbon in environmental applications. We also review the state
of the art in the determination of physical parameters central to the processes that contribute to the non-
equilibrium nanoscale heat and mass balances of laser-heated particles; these parameters are important
for LII-signal analysis and simulation. Awareness of the significance of particle aggregation and coat-
ings has increased recently, and the effects of these characteristics on the LII technique are discussed.
Because of the range of experimental constraints in the variety of applications for which laser-
induced incandescence is suited, many implementation approaches have been developed. This review
discusses considerations for selection of laser and detection characteristics to address application-
specific needs. The benefits of using LII for measurements of a range of nanoparticles in the fields mentioned
above are demonstrated with some typical examples, covering simple flames, internal-combustion engines,
exhaust emissions, the ambient atmosphere, and nanoparticle production. We also remark on less well-
known studies employing LII for particles suspended in liquids.

An important aspect of the paper is to critically assess the improvement in the understanding of the
fundamental physical mechanisms at the nanoscale and the determination of underlying parameters;
we also identify further research needs in these contexts. Building on this enhanced capability in de-
scribing the underlying complex processes, LII has become a workhorse of particulate measurement in
a variety of fields, and its utility continues to be expanding. When coupled with complementary methods,
such as light scattering, probe-sampling, molecular-beam techniques, and other nanoparticle instru-
mentation, new directions for research and applications with LII continue to materialize.

1. Introduction

The past several decades have been marked by a growing concern
over the effects of combustion-generated particles on human health
and the environment. Numerous scientific studies have indicated
that soot particles, commonly produced during the incomplete com-
bustion of hydrocarbons, pose a serious public health risk, e.g. Ref.
1. The effects of atmospheric soot emissions have gained a great deal
of recent attention, stemming from growing concerns over the con-
tribution of black-carbon particles to climate change. Most
atmospheric particles reflect incoming solar radiation and tend to
partially counteract global warming; soot particles, in contrast,
strongly absorb in the visible and near infrared and are associated
with significant positive radiative forcing leading to global warming.
Models predict that the radiative forcing from atmospheric soot is
~65% that of CO2, the most abundant greenhouse gas [2]. Relative
to CO2, however, soot has a short lifetime in the Earth’s atmo-
sphere, and reducing soot emissions into the atmosphere has been
proposed as a near-term climate-change mitigation approach [3].
Black carbon can also settle on snow and ice, and thus decrease their
reflectivity. In addition to increasing the radiative forcing because
of this albedo effect, the additional surface absorption can accel-
erate melting of snow and ice, which, in turn, further enhances
surface absorptivity and global warming [2,4].

Hydrocarbon combustion is the main source of atmospheric soot
emissions, and, although soot chemistry has been studied exten-
sively over decades, some of the primary mechanisms in soot
formation, growth, and oxidation are uncertain [5–8]. Controlling
soot emissions will require focused efforts to understand soot for-
mation and oxidation under a variety of combustion conditions.
Combustion is also the main source for industrially manufactured
carbon nanostructures and provides various opportunities for the
synthesis of non-carbon nanoparticulate materials [9]. Experimen-
tal studies of particulate formation in the context of both reduced
emissions and targeted synthesis rely heavily on the ability to
measure and characterize particles over a wide range of conditions.
Whereas incipient soot is close to spherical, small (1–10 nm), and
composed of large organic species with high hydrogen-to-carbon
ratios, mature soot is composed of primary particles of 10–50 nm
in diameter with fine structures similar to polycrystalline graph-
ite (low hydrogen-to-carbon ratios) [10–14]. These primary particles
are covalently bound into branched-chain aggregates of tens to hun-
dreds of nanometers in size. These aggregates are non-spherical and
are characterized by fractal dimensions typically in the range of 1.7–
1.9 [11,14–18]. The non-sphericity of these particles complicates
optical measurements of them. In addition, these particles can be
coated with semi-volatile coatings in the combustor, exhaust stream,
or atmosphere, which can significantly change their physical

characteristics and optical properties. Mature soot, whether coated
or not, absorbs strongly in the ultraviolet (UV), visible, and infra-
red (IR) wavelength ranges, is a refractory material with a
sublimation point of about 4000 K, and is insoluble in polar and non-
polar solvents. Atmospheric scientists refer to particles with these
characteristics as “black carbon” [2,19,20]. When we speak of car-
bonaceous particles or soot without further specification in this text,
we mean the type of solid particles combustion scientists refer to
as “mature soot” and the atmospheric community has defined as
“black carbon”. To reduce redundancy and confusion, we avoid the
commonly used expression “refractory black carbon” or “rBC”
because all black carbon particles are refractory.

Laser-induced incandescence (LII) has become a workhorse for
in situ measurements of mature-soot particles in combustion and
ambient atmospheric environments. This technique involves heating
soot particles with a high-power, pulsed or continuous-wave (CW)
laser to temperatures high enough to emit measurable quasi-
blackbody radiation. This emission is recorded either with gated
(time-integrated) detection techniques, often for the spatially re-
solved visualization of particle-distribution or volume-fraction
measurements, or with time-resolved detection methods, partic-
ularly for primary-particle size or single-particle measurements. One
advantage of LII is that it is particularly sensitive to, and highly se-
lective for, soot particles because they absorb strongly and can be
heated to temperatures of ~4000 K before they sublime. LII with
pulsed and CW lasers (called pulsed LII and CW LII in this paper,
respectively) are based on the same physical processes, but the ex-
periments and the data analyses are different. They will be treated
in parallel throughout the paper.

Alternative methods for measuring the concentrations of par-
ticulate matter and particle sizes include in situ optical and probe-
sampling online and ex situ approaches. Direct comparison of the
existing techniques is complicated because they use different phys-
ical effects for detection and thus respond in different ways to the
chemical composition (e.g., volatile vs. non-volatile components) and
morphology (measuring primary-particle sizes, aggregate sizes, or
mass). Sampling techniques are additionally influenced by arti-
facts that may occur during sampling (condensation, formation of
additional particles, agglomeration) and the modification of the
structure of particles when deposited on surfaces and exposed to
environmental conditions. Nevertheless, all of these techniques have
inherent strengths and potential weaknesses and characteristics that

can be exploited for selected applications or combined with LII in
order to extend ranges of applicability.

Similarly to LII, photoacoustic techniques take advantage of the
large absorption cross section in the ultraviolet, visible, and infra-
red for selective measurements of soot particles [21,22]; these
techniques, however, do not heat the particles to the same degree,
are influenced by other absorbing species, and thus do not have the
same selectivity. Elastic light scattering (ELS) is even less selective
than photoacoustic approaches and will give signal from other par-
ticles, such as fuel or water droplets. ELS can, however, yield
information about aggregate sizes and morphologies [15,23–30].
Coupling these optical techniques can be a powerful approach for
in situ and ex situ particle characterization.

Measuring light extinction, which results from a combination of
absorption and scattering, provides absolute soot-volume frac-
tions if the optical properties are known [31–34]. It is the most direct
and commonly employed method to measure soot concentrations
in flames and is thus often used to calibrate LII volume-fraction mea-
surements [35–39]. Applications of extinction often employ a
standard approach of scanning a laser beam through a flame or other
sample or using full-field extinction [40] with an expanded light
bundle. In axisymmetric flames extinction is usually analyzed with
an Abel inversion procedure to obtain local concentrations. In non-
premixed flames application of this inversion may be challenging
[41] as regions of low soot concentration may be surrounded by
annular zones of high soot load. Considerable improvement in full-
field extinction techniques has been achieved by the introduction
of diffused light illumination, mitigating effects of beam steering
[42,43]. For atmospheric applications, particle concentrations are
generally too low to measure using single-pass extinction, and multi-
pass approaches, such as cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS), are
used [44–46]. CRDS can be sensitive enough to measure single par-
ticles [47]. As an alternative to extinction, a number of emission
techniques have been introduced to investigate soot in flames
[48–50]. These techniques also suffer from the inherent chal-
lenges of retrieving spatially-resolved information from integrated
signals. For these types of studies, LII has the advantage of appli-
cability in an imaging mode for the determination of spatial
distributions of particles.

For measurements of concentrations of carbon particles in engine
exhaust and the atmosphere, various techniques exist that are ex-
tensively treated in several review articles [20,51–53]. Methods

employed in these disparate research areas have converged in recent
years because drastically reduced particulate-matter emissions from
engines yield relevant concentrations in engine exhaust that are
similar to those in the atmosphere. In the field of engine-exhaust
analysis, the traditional procedure is Constant Volume Sampling
(CVS), combined with the deposition of particulate matter on a filter
[54]. Besides simple gravimetric analysis, various alternative ap-
proaches allow for a determination of the composition of the matter
collected. Filter-based approaches are also very common for atmo-
spheric measurements [20,46]. Another popular approach in this
area relies on the aethalometer principle, where the opacity of a
filter paper after loading is measured optically. Other instruments
in this field include photoacoustic spectroscopy, mentioned above,
and various forms of microbalances. For further information the
reader is referred to recent reviews [20,51,53,54].

For particle-size measurements, LII provides information about
primary-particle sizes. These measurements are sometimes comple-
mented by ex situ measurements of aggregate-size distributions by
differential-mobility sizing using a scanning mobility particle sizer
(SMPS). Here, particles are charged and size-selected according to
their mobility in the carrier gas within an electric field; particles
within the various size fractions are subsequently counted with a
condensation particle counter (CPC). This technique yields the elec-
tric mobility diameter, which is the diameter of a sphere that would
balance the electric force with the drag force on a charged parti-
cle in an electric field moving with a flow field. For a soot aggregate,
which is not spherical, the mobility diameter can be related to the
radius of gyration [55], but the relationship depends on the parti-
cle morphology [14] and the properties of the carrier gas. Aggregate
sizes can similarly be measured using an aerodynamic particle sizer,
the measurement concept of which is based on measurements of
drag forces from particle velocities in an accelerating carrier gas,
e.g. Refs. 56 and 57. These measurements are usually made for single
particles in the inlet of an aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) fol-
lowing an aerodynamic lens system, e.g., Refs. 58 and 59.
Alternatively, the aerodynamic aerosol classifier (AAC) measures the
aerodynamic size by balancing aerodynamic drag forces with cen-
trifugal forces generated between rotating drums at atmospheric
pressure [60,61]. Particle-mass distributions can similarly be mea-
sured using a centrifugal particle-mass analyzer (CPMA) or aerosol
particle mass analyzer (APM), which classifies charged particles sub-
jected to a centrifugal force generated between rotating drums by
their mass-to-charge ratio [62,63]. An attractive feature of the AAC
is that it does not require charging the particles and thus is not con-
founded by multiple charging effects common to the SMPS, CPMA,
and APM.

All these measurements require extractive sampling and deliv-
ery to the measurement device. Dilution techniques are often
employed in an attempt to avoid interaction of particles in the sam-
pling lines and condensation of volatile species. In practice, avoiding
condensation and nucleation in the extraction probe is difficult. Sam-
pling techniques that gather particle samples from flames and hot
gases, e.g., by thermophoretic sampling on a surface that is exposed
to the gases for a short period, have been developed for atmospher-
ic and high-pressure systems [64,65], but measures need to be taken
to avoid or account for particle modification by condensation on
the cool sampling surface. For sampled particles, imaging tech-
niques, such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning
electron microscopy (SEM), have been invaluable for characteriz-
ing aggregate morphologies and sizes and primary-particle sizes,
e.g. Refs. 13 and 66–72. X-ray spectroscopic techniques, such as near-
edge x-ray absorption fine-structure spectroscopy (NEXAFS), e.g. Refs.
73–75, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), e.g. Refs. 68, 76,
and 77, can also provide considerable information about soot-
particle fine structure and chemical composition, e.g. Refs. 68 and
73. X-ray scattering techniques, such as small- and wide-angle x-ray

scattering (SAXS and WAXS, respectively), have also been used for
in situ measurements of soot-particle size and morphology
[75,78–86].

Online measurements of particles from flames and atmospher-
ic samples have been carried out with molecular-beam and particle-
beam techniques, in which an aerosol sample is locally extracted
from a flame or the atmosphere, and further reaction is inter-
rupted by rapid expansion of the sampled aerosol into vacuum or
by rapid dilution with an inert gas. A particle-laden beam is formed
and sent into an AMS or a particle-mass spectrometer (PMS) [87–89],
which is a variant of the classical mass spectrometer for gaseous
species and very small particles [90]. A fraction of the particles in
the sample are charged either by collisions with ions or electrons,
by thermionic emission, or by photoionization. In the size range of
interest for studying primary particles, multiple charging is unlike-
ly according to Fuchs’ theory [91]. The particle beam is directed
through a velocity filter and an adjustable electric field. The par-
ticles are deflected according to their kinetic energy and charge
toward a Faraday cup, where their number is counted by measur-
ing charges. This arrangement has been used in combination with
LII measurements in low-pressure and atmospheric-pressure flames
[92–95]. Alternatively the particles are vaporized thermally or pho-
tolytically, and the particle constituents are analyzed in a mass
spectrometer, providing detailed information about particle com-
position, e.g. Refs. 92 and 96–104.

Under some conditions, LII has been combined with comple-
mentary, non-optical techniques for particle characterization and
for intercomparison of alternative methods, e.g. Refs. 69, 70, 95, and
105. The combination of methods may further be used to obtain
even more information about the morphology of complex par-
ticles. While elastic light scattering (ELS) or its combination with
LII yields radii of gyration of soot aggregates, alternative methods
may provide an aerodynamic or an electrical mobility diameter, all
demonstrating different dependencies on the structure of complex
particles.

Additional methods may also be useful for the calibration of LII
measurements. Besides extinction, such methods include the ab-
solute intensity approach, requiring knowledge of the particle
temperature from multi-wavelength pyrometry in order to deter-
mine mass and volume concentration [105–107], and comparison
to gravimetric filter methods for mass or volume concentration in
ex situ applications [108]. Single-particle CW instruments are gen-
erally calibrated using a mobility size-selected particle distribution
of a carbonaceous material that gives similar behavior to atmo-
spheric particles, such as agglomerated-fullerene particles [109–111].
This review updates and expands on previous reviews
[20,112–115]. We focus here on fundamental aspects of the tech-
nique and its implementation, highlighting new developments over
the past several years. In particular, we have included sections on
the effects of aggregation and particle coatings on LII signals, LII from
non-carbonaceous materials, and the application of the technique
to atmospheric particulates.

2. Principle and development of LII

Laser-induced incandescence is generated by heating particles
with a high-energy or high-power laser. As particles interact with
the laser and absorb light, their temperatures increase, leading to
a strong non-linear increase in thermal radiation, i.e., incandes-
cence, with temperature according to Planck’s law. Fig. 1 shows a
typical experimental setup used to measure in situ time-resolved
particle temperatures and pulsed-LII signals. There are several key
components to an LII setup for either pulsed or CW LII. The details
of implementation will vary between CW or pulsed approaches, but
the fundamental roles of the components are the same. Fig. 1 dem-
onstrates these components for pulsed LII. They include:

(1) The laser system: Particles are very commonly heated with
the fundamental beam of a pulsed Nd:YAG laser at 1064 nm.
The second harmonic (i.e., 532 nm) can be used to heat the
particles, but visible (and shorter) wavelengths are often
avoided for combustion conditions because of potential in-
terferences from laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) from
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (see Section 4.1.1).
Sometimes an injection-seeded laser is used for applica-
tions that require a smooth laser temporal profile (see Section
4.1.4).

(2) Optics for laser-beam intensity control: The laser beam in-
tensity can be attenuated to control the fluence using a
combination of a half-wave plate, which rotates the laser po-
larization, and a thin-film polarizer, which transmits only one
linear component of the polarized beam and rejects the other.
The setup shown in Fig. 1 has two thin-film polarizers for
better rejection of the off-axis polarization and better fluence
control. Sometimes a thin-film polarizer is placed before the
half-wave plate to pass the dominant polarization of the laser
output and reject portions of the beam that may have
scrambled polarization caused by strain birefringence in the
oscillator rod.

(3) Optics for managing the spatial profile of the laser beam: The
laser beam can be used directly, or it can be shaped for a spe-
cific application. For imaging of particle distributions, the beam
can be expanded in one direction and reduced in the other
using cylindrical lenses to produce a laser-sheet profile (see,
for example, Fig. 26). For applications that require a top-hat
(i.e., homogeneous) spatial profile, an optical layout like the
one shown in Fig. 1 is often used. The near-field output of the
laser is relay imaged to an aperture using a two-lens tele-
scope. The first lens is one focal length away from the laser
output coupler. The distance between the first lens and the
second is the sum of their focal lengths. In Fig. 1, the lenses
have the same focal length, and the telescope neither expands
nor reduces the beam (i.e., one-to-one imaging is employed
in the first telescope). The aperture is separated from the
second lens by the lens’s focal length. A true image of the
beam at the output coupler is formed at the position of the
aperture, where the beam is collimated. The aperture passes
only the center of the beam, which is relatively flat if the full
output of the laser is Gaussian or quasi-Gaussian. A second
telescope relays the image of the aperture to the detection
volume. In the example shown in Fig. 1, the second lens has
a focal length that is one-half that of the first lens, and the
beam is therefore reduced by a factor of 2. Any number of
two-lens image-relaying telescopes can be used in series to
relay the near-field beam quality to the detection volume. The
spatial filtering aperture can be placed at the front end of any
of these telescopes to be imaged to the detection volume. An
example of the beam spatial profile at the detection volume
is shown in the inset. In the setup in Fig. 1, the laser power
and beam spatial profile are monitored, and the laser beam
is collected in a beam dump after passing through the sample.
(4) The sample: In Fig. 1, the beam is passed through a flame,

where it interacts with soot.

(5) Detection optics: In Fig. 1, the signal is split and is passed
through imaging optics similar to those in the laser beam.
Fig. 1 shows two-lens telescopes that include achromatic
lenses separated from each other by the sum of the focal
lengths. The first lens is a focal length away from the flame,
and the second lens is a focal length away from the detec-
tor. Dichroic filters are generally placed in the collimated
region between the lenses. Other imaging configurations are
also common. In Fig. 1, there is a notch filter to block laser
scatter and filters selected for two-color LII (see Section 4.2.2).

(6) The detector(s): Fig. 1 shows two photomultiplier tubes (PMTs)
connected to an oscilloscope for time-resolved detection. There
are many detector configurations tailored to the applica-
tion. Alternatively, there could be CCD cameras for imaging
the soot distribution (see Section 4.2).

Examples of the time dependence of the particle temperature
and resulting LII signal are shown in Fig. 2 for pulsed-laser heating
of flame-generated soot. At low laser fluences (Fig. 2a), particle tem-
peratures increase throughout most of the laser pulse until the
absorptive heating rate is balanced by rates of other cooling mecha-
nisms. The cooling is dominated by conduction to the surrounding
atmosphere at atmospheric and higher pressures. After the laser
pulse, the signal decays relatively slowly at atmospheric pressure
and flame temperatures. In the low-fluence regime, when laser
fluences are increased, signal decay rates following the laser pulse
increase because the difference between the peak particle temper-
ature and the ambient temperature increases. At higher pressures
and lower gas temperatures, conductive cooling rates and LII signal
decay rates are much faster. At high fluences (Fig. 2b), particles
sublime during the laser pulse, and LII-signal-decay rates are pre-
dominantly controlled by the rate of mass loss. At these fluences,
the rate of signal decay from mass loss depends on laser fluence;
once the particle reaches the sublimation point, the signal-decay
rate increases substantially with increasing laser fluence, which shifts
the peak signal to earlier times with increasing laser fluence. An
example of this behavior, which is a distinguishing feature of pulsed-
LII signals in the high-fluence regime, is shown in Fig. 3 from Ni et al.
[116]; curves 2, 3, and 4 are in this regime.

At high laser fluences, particle temperatures reach a maximum
close to the sublimation temperature, as shown in Fig. 4. Under flame
conditions for pulsed LII, spectrally inferred temperatures are often
higher than the equilibrium sublimation temperature of ~4140 K
at which C3 sublimes, and particles sometimes appear to reach tem-
peratures of ~4460 K at which C2 sublimes [116,118–121]. The reason
for this behavior is not well understood and requires further work.
The peak-LII signals saturate when the sublimation temperature is
reached (see Fig. 4). This behavior has been observed in pulsed LII
in several studies [116,120–123]. The peak temperature inferred from
spectrally resolved incandescence, however, depends on the wave-
length dependence of the emissivity used to fit the spectra
[116,119,123,124]. The current uncertainties in this wavelength de-
pendence convey an uncertainty of ~200 K to the soot peak
temperature in the high-fluence regime for mature soot [119,123]
and an even higher uncertainty for less mature soot [123]. These
fluence curves were recorded with a top-hat laser-beam profile and
a fast detector. Influences of the experimental conditions on these
fluence curves are discussed in Section 4.

The underlying processes are the same for CW-laser heating of
the particles. In the most common implementation of this tech-
nique, individual particles are injected into the cavity of a CW-
laser beam, and the broadband-LII signal is recorded as the particles
traverse the beam. The intra-cavity-beam intensity is very high (in
the range of 1.7 × 105–1 × 106 W/cm2 [125,126]), and the particles
traverse the beam for ~10 μs before they exit the beam or are fully
vaporized [125,127–130] A typical CW-LII temporal profile is shown
in Fig. 5. The laser–particle interaction is determined by the drift
time of the particle through the laser beam [131] and is compara-
ble to particles interacting with a high-fluence laser pulse (~3 J/
cm2) with a pulse duration of ~10 μs [130]. Peak CW-LII signals
demonstrate similar behavior to that shown in Fig. 4a when the laser
power is varied [126]. Ideally, under normal operating conditions,
the particles are heated to the sublimation temperature and are fully
sublimed, and changing the laser power simply changes the amount
of time it takes to sublime the particle. Current measurements
with this technique commonly use the approach developed by

Fig. 1. Experimental setup for time-resolved pulsed-LII-signal collection: Soot particles, generated in a flame, are irradiated with the output from an Nd:YAG laser at either
1064 or 532 nm. An aperture close to the laser selects the center of the beam. This aperture is relay-imaged to the detection region in the flame to generate a collimated
beam with a top-hat spatial profile. Typical top-hat beam profiles are inset in the upper left-hand corner. The beam is monitored with a beam profiler and attenuated using
a half-wave plate and thin-film polarizers; the graphs on each side of the profiles show the intensity profile through the center of the respective beams. The resulting in-
candescence is imaged onto a combination of fast photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) equipped with different bandpass filters. Notch filters (532 or 1064-nm, depending on laser
wavelength) are also placed in front of the PMTs to block laser scatter.

Stephens et al. [133] and implemented for atmospheric measure-
ments by Schwarz et al. [125–127] and Moteki and Kondo [129,131].
This approach is employed in the Single-Particle Soot Photometer
(SP2, Droplet Measurement Technologies), which is shown in Fig. 6.
During either pulsed- or CW-LII-signal collection, the particle can
also heat by oxidation or cool by radiative emission. Other pro-
cesses can influence the signal, including changes to the optical
properties of the particle during the heating and cooling process,
e.g., by annealing of the particle fine structure or changes to the ag-
gregate morphology or composition. These processes are reviewed
in more detail in the next section.

The first published demonstration of the application of LII to
measure soot involved the use of a TEA CO2 laser to heat carbon-
black particles [134]. The signals were temporally resolved and
analyzed using an energy-balance model. Weeks and Duley [134] pro-
posed that the temporally-resolved LII signal could be used to infer
particle size. A few years later Eckbreth [135] and Burakov et al. [136]
developed energy- and mass-balance models to describe laser-
induced heating, incandescence, and saturation of LII signal from soot
by vaporization of the particle and used temporal LII profiles mea-
sured in flames to validate their models. Bukatyi et al. [137,138] and
Melton [139] later expanded the model analysis to include other
heating and cooling mechanisms. This early work provided a basis
for much of the development performed over the next decade
for applications of LII to study soot in engine cylinders [140–145],
engine exhaust [106,108,146,147], laminar and turbulent flames
[24,36,67,117,148–163], and other environments [164–166]. These
demonstrations of the applicability of LII to particle measurements
under adverse conditions were followed by an explosion of work ap-
plying LII to a wide variety of combustion and atmospheric conditions.

(solid lines) recorded for a laser wavelength of 1064 nm. The dotted lines repre-
sent the laser temporal profile. The particle temperatures were inferred from emission
spectra, and the LII signal was recorded using a 681.8-nm bandpass filter. Measure-
ments were made on mature soot in an atmospheric co-flow diffusion flame. Data
are shown for fluences of (a) 0.1 J/cm2 and (b) 1.45 J/cm2. The delay between the
rise in temperature and LII signal is related to the detected spectral range and the
strong nonlinearity of the signal as a function of the temperature. Adapted from Goulay
et al. [117].

Will et al. [120,167,168] and Roth et al. [157,169–172] made sig-
nificant advances in the modeling of time-resolved signals for
primary-particle sizing, an approach now usually referred to as TiRe-
LII. Following the earlier modeling work of Weeks and Duley [134],
Eckbreth [135], Burakov et al. [136], Bukatyi et al. [137,138], and
Melton [139], Bengtsson et al. [173,174], Smallwood et al.
[121,147,175,176], and Michelsen [177,178] developed detailed

models to serve as a means to extend the technique to a wider variety
of conditions, including high pressures and low temperatures, by
understanding and targeting the largest sources of uncertainties.
This work was complemented and followed by a considerable body
of work to develop models for predicting LII signals under a wide
range of conditions [35,129,133,146,148,155,179–191]. Vander Wal
et al. [13,37,192] performed extensive surveys of experimental pa-
rameters for optimizing the application of the technique, used LII
coupled with laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) measurements to dis-
tinguish soot precursors from mature soot particles in flames
[159,161,193], and applied the technique to carbon nanotubes and
other materials [194,195]. Snelling and coworkers [106,107,196] de-
veloped the technique of auto-compensating LII, which enabled
quantitative measurements of volume fraction without the need for
calibration via another soot measurement technique, such as ex-
tinction or gravimetric analysis. De Iuliis et al. [122] also recognized
the benefits of this approach, and it has subsequently been adopted

by others. Witze et al. coupled LII with elastic scattering measure-
ments to measure particle-size changes from laser-induced
sublimation [26] and to infer the fraction of volatile coatings on
exhaust particles [197,198]. Atmospheric black-carbon measure-
ments usually employ an approach developed by Stephens et al. [133]
in which individual particles are injected into the cavity of a CW
laser, and the LII signal is recorded simultaneously with elastic scatter
from the particle. Stephens et al. [133], Schwarz et al. [125,126], and
Moteki and Kondo [129] demonstrated that the magnitude of the
peak of the LII signal provides information about the mass of an in-
dividual particle, and the relative timing of the LII and scatter signals
provides some information about volatile coatings. Alternatively, at-
mospheric measurements can be performed with a high-sensitivity
variant of pulsed LII [199,200].

A large body of work has been published on the applications of
LII to combustion, industrial, and atmospheric environments. In this
review we give examples of some of this work to provide the reader
with an overview of what has been done and where the field cur-
rently stands. With careful experimental design and appropriate
calibration, LII measurements of volume and mass concentration
can be made without a detailed heat-transfer model or understand-
ing of all the fundamental processes. However, this fundamental
understanding is essential for an accurate determination of primary-
particle sizes, reduction of measurement uncertainties, identification
of artifacts, and resolution of issues and limitations associated with
LII measurements. We conclude with a perspective on current un-
derlying issues and limitations, and suggest possibilities for areas
of development.

3. Fundamental understanding

3.1. Underlying processes

LII measurements entail heating particles to temperatures at
which incandescence is readily observable. These temperatures are
generally in the range of 2500–4000 K. Under these conditions a
number of processes can be initiated and have significant impact
on the LII signal. A great deal of work has focused on developing

Fig. 7. Illustration of processes influencing the temperature and mass of a particle
during LII-signal collection: Particles are heated by absorption of laser radiation, and,
to a lesser extent, by oxidation and annealing. Under most conditions, particles cool
by conduction to the surrounding gas and sublimation, and, to a lesser extent, by
thermionic emission and radiative emission. Particles lose mass by sublimation and
oxidation. Signal is derived from radiative emission from the particle.

an understanding of these processes and models capable of pre-
dicting LII signals under a variety of conditions; we will refer to these
papers in the respective sections of this paper. In this section we
discuss the processes that are involved, or are likely to be in-
volved, in determining the temporal evolution of the LII signal and
highlight uncertainties associated with our incomplete understand-
ing of these processes. These individual processes contribute to the
energy and mass balance of the particle. Fig. 7 provides a summary
illustration of these processes.

Many researchers have implemented the underlying equations
into in-house software to predict and analyze LII signals. With LIISim,
one system has been made freely available [201]; this system allows
the user to calculate LII-signal decays for variable conditions and
provides data-analysis capabilities for uploaded experimental data.
The Community LII Modeling Environment (CLiiME) [202] will also
be publicly available soon. The CLiiME code uses object-oriented
modern Fortran and is modular, open-source, and user modifi-
able, and the default model has been validated over a wide range
of conditions and can be applied to either pulsed- or CW-LII
configurations.

3.1.1. Energy and mass balance

The time evolution of the particle temperature and diameter are
calculated by solving the time-dependent energy and mass balance
equations including the contributions from a number of mecha-
nisms. The energy-balance equation can be summarized as

Michelsen et al. [203] derived a modified expression with an extra
term that accounts for the loss of some ability to store sensible heat
when the mass of the particle is reduced, but this term is can-
celed in Eq. (1) by extra terms introduced in similar expansions of
terms for sublimation [176,185,203] and oxidation [185,203]. The
interested reader is referred to the respective papers; in the fol-

Solving these coupled differential equations yields the mass, di-

The LII signal is produced by radiative emission from a heated
particle. The signal per primary particle S is calculated using the
Planck function modified by the emissivity ελ to account for devia-
tions from a perfect blackbody, a function to account for the
wavelength-dependent efficiency of the detection system Σλ, and
a factor to account for the solid angle detected Ω, i.e.,

where m is the complex index of refraction and E(m) is the refractive-
index function for absorption discussed in Sec. 3.2.2. The absorption
function E(m) depends on wavelength, and, based on Kirchhoff’s law,
also describes the emission properties of a particle. The signal is
usually calculated over some narrow or broad wavelength range in
the ultraviolet, visible, or near-infrared spectral regions.

3.1.2. Laser absorption and radiative emission

The most important process for LII is the initial step involving
the heating of the particle by absorption of the incident laser light.
In the absence of any nonlinear absorption mechanism, this process
is straightforward and easily calculated, as long as the absorption
cross section is known. The absorption cross section is the geomet-
ric cross section, i.e. the cross-sectional area, πdp
2 in the case of a
spherical particle, multiplied by the so-called absorption efficiency

that represents the ratio between the true and the geometric cross
section. For a primary particle in the Rayleigh regime (dp << λL where
λL is the laser wavelength), the absorption cross section is given by

.

(8)

One important implication, e.g., relevant for the measurement
of soot-volume fraction by LII, is that the absorption cross section
for small particles scales with particle volume. This cross section
will change if the particle size changes (e.g., if the particle starts to
sublime and shrink or undergoes swelling with increasing temper-
ature and decreasing density) or if the index of refraction and E(m)
change (e.g., if the particle anneals to a more ordered form of carbon).
The absorptive-heating rate (in units of J/s) is then calculated ac-
cording to

The radiative-cooling rate is calculated using the Planck func-

there is no wavelength dependence to E(m), the radiative-cooling
rate is given by [177]

A wavelength dependence for E(m) can also be taken into account
in a similar, more complicated expression [177]. The radiative-
cooling rate is normally significantly smaller than other cooling rates,
such as the conductive-cooling rate at atmospheric pressure and
above and the evaporative-cooling rate at high laser fluence. Under
vacuum at low laser fluences, however, this mechanism is the dom-
inant cooling mechanism. Recent experimental work has been
performed under vacuum conditions to study this mechanism in
more detail [175,184,204], but more work needs to be done to
improve the experimental results and model comparisons.

3.1.3. Conduction

For CW LII and at low and moderate laser fluence for pulsed LII,
conductive cooling is the most important processes for heat loss by
the particle, particularly at atmospheric pressure and above (for the
relative importance of the various cooling processes as a function
of particle temperature, see Section 3.1.8). Understanding heat trans-
fer by conduction is critically important for inferring primary-
particle sizes from pulsed-LII decay rates. Conductive cooling also
competes with absorptive heating on the timescales relevant for CW-
LII detection and can limit the minimum particle size detectable
using this approach [126,130]. Considerable work has been devoted
to identifying an appropriate conductive-heat-transfer mecha-
nism for LII applications. In the free-molecular-flow regime (where
the mean free path is much greater than the particle diameter), the
conductive-cooling rate can be expressed as [177,205,206]

where the additional R(T – T0) accounts for the work associated with
the expansion of the heated gas molecules leaving the surface. In
many LII models the heat capacity is assumed to be constant; this
assumption has little impact on the calculated value of the
conductive-cooling rate [203]. Neglecting the work of expansion,
however, may decrease the conductive-cooling rate considerably
[203].

Whereas free-molecular-regime conduction models are valid for
flames at atmospheric pressure and below, transition- and
continuum-regime models are more accurate in simulation of con-
duction for room temperature or high-pressure applications. A review
of these models by Liu et al. [207] recommends the Fuchs boundary-
sphere model [91] for modeling particle conductive cooling in LII
applications because it has greater accuracy throughout the tran-
sition regime and beyond, i.e., to large particle-to-gas temperature
ratios. Many models use an alternative mechanism introduced by
McCoy and Cha [208] and used in the model developed by Melton
[139]. Transition-regime approaches, such as the Fuchs boundary-
sphere model [91] and the McCoy–Cha [208] mechanism, are
preferred for high-pressure applications. Work by Kuhlmann et al.
[168] suggests that, at atmospheric pressure and an ambient gas
temperature of 300 K, the Fuchs boundary-sphere model [91] pre-
dicts conductive-cooling rates as much as 20% higher than those
calculated using the McCoy–Cha approach [208] for typical primary-
particle sizes of ~30 nm, as shown in Fig. 8. Bambha and Michelsen
[130] demonstrated that the McCoy–Cha approach [208] can be used
to reproduce CW-LII temporal profiles at room temperature and at-
mospheric pressure, as long as shielding to individual primary
particles is explicitly taken into account.

The McCoy–Cha expression [208] assumes a transition regime
between the free-molecular regime and the continuum regime and
is represented as

Equation (13) can be shown to be equivalent to Eq. (11) when
GL >> dp [205]. The expression given in Eq. (14) is appropriate for
monatomic bath gases. Modifications to this model, which account
for conductive cooling by polyatomic gases, have also been em-
ployed to reproduce room temperature, atmospheric pressure, CW-
LII temporal profiles [130].

The value used for αT has a significant effect on the calculated
conductive-cooling rate. Section 3.2.1 gives an overview of the un-
certainties associated with this parameter. Snelling et al. [121] have
shown that models need to account for changes in the local gas tem-
perature resulting from heat transfer to the surrounding bath gas
under some conditions. This effect has been further investigated ex-
perimentally by Nordström et al. [209]. With respect to conductive
cooling, much of the current work focuses on understanding the
impact of aggregate size [69,130,168,207,210–214], primary-
particle polydispersity [207,213,215–217], bridging between primary
particles [214], aggregate morphology [70,130], and particle ma-
turity [218,219] on pulsed-LII-signal decay rates and CW-LII-
signal timing; the work on the influence of aggregate size and
structure is reviewed in Section 3.3. A number of studies have also
targeted high-pressure applications for which this influence is ex-
tremely important [220–225].

3.1.4. Sublimation and other vaporization mechanisms

At high laser fluences evaporative-heat loss is the most signif-
icant cooling mechanism. More importantly, however, sublimation
and other vaporization mechanisms lead to rapid decreases in LII
signal because of mass loss during the laser pulse. These mecha-
nisms are the most poorly understood of the mechanisms that have
a strong influence on LII signals. Most LII models are not able to re-
produce the rapid signal decays attributable to evaporative-mass
loss or the plateau in the peak temperature at high fluences (shown
in Fig. 4).

The majority of LII models represent the evaporative-cooling rate

as [139,147,205]

where αM is the mass-accommodation coefficient, pV is the average
saturation partial pressure of the sublimed carbon clusters, and K
is a constant that is typically equal to 0.5 but is sometimes given a
value of 0.4 to account for non-idealities of the bath gas and des-
orbed clusters [181]. Some models use temperature-dependent
parameterizations for the average mass, enthalpy of formation, and

partial pressure for the sublimed carbon clusters [147,203], whereas
others use the specific mass, enthalpy of formation, and partial pres-
sure derived from the Clausius–Clapeyron equation for each carbon
cluster sublimed [172,177]. A summary of sublimation sub-models
is given in Ref. 205.

In order to reproduce the fast signal decay rates for pulsed LII
at high fluence, however, a much faster mechanism must be in-
cluded in the model [177,187,189,205]. Such a mechanism is also
required to keep the particles from superheating to temperatures
well above the sublimation temperature (see Fig. 4). One ap-
proach is to use a photodesorption mechanism that limits absorption
of photons to states that thermalize, and allows photons to excite
states that lead to non-thermal mass loss. One such mechanism is
described in Ref. 177, and a similar mechanism is described in Ref.
205.

Experimental studies have demonstrated that soot aggregates
do not disaggregate (i.e., break into individual primary particles)
when laser heated, even at high fluences [67,70,73,153,192,193]. Mea-
sured changes in soot scattering and absorption cross sections have
indicated that vaporization leads to particle-size reductions during
laser irradiation [26,118,179,226,227]. These results are consis-
tent with conclusions drawn from transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) images of laser-irradiated soot particles, which have dem-
onstrated aggregates with smaller primary particles but the same
morphology as non-irradiated particles [67,73,153,192,193]. Further
support is provided by scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) mea-
surements of laser-heated soot particles, which showed formation
of new particles with amorphous carbon fine structure (as deter-
mined by TEM), suggesting condensation of vaporized carbon clusters
[73]. Despite these studies, considerably more work is needed to
understand and experimentally confirm these mechanisms.

3.1.5. Oxidation

Oxidation can lead to both particle heating and mass loss, but
this process is much slower and less significant than either laser
heating or evaporative-mass loss at high laser fluences. Its rate is
on the time scale of conductive cooling, however, and it tends to
slow signal decay rates for pulsed LII at low fluences [187,203]. Ne-
glecting oxidation could thus have an impact on primary-particle
sizing at low fluences. Nevertheless, most LII models do not include
this mechanism [205]. The oxidative-heating term can be ex-
pressed as [177,203,205]

2C+O2 → 2CO. The expression given by Eq. (17), however, does not
account for the temperature of the incoming O2 [185,203]. Michelsen

counts for the incoming O2, i.e.,

where NA is the Avogadro constant, and kox is the rate constant for
2C + O2 →2CO. Of course, under combustion conditions, concen-
trations of radical species OH and O can be significant, and rates
of oxidation by these species may contribute substantially to overall
oxidation rates [228–230]. In the atmosphere, NO2 can also oxidize
soot [231]. At LII temperatures, however, oxidation by O2 is rapid
and nearly diffusion controlled, and using reactions with O2 as a
proxy for oxidation by all oxygenated species is not a bad approx-
imation. Other chemical reactions at the surface, such as growth
mechanisms, happen on timescales longer than those important for
LII detection.

3.1.6. Annealing

Numerous experimental studies have demonstrated that the fine
structure of mature soot is very similar to polycrystalline graphite
with graphite crystallites preferentially aligned parallel to the par-
ticle surface near the surface and more randomly ordered near the
center of the particle [10,12,73,232–234]. Several studies have shown
that these particles can anneal when irradiated with a laser, such
that graphite crystallites originally ~2–5 nm in length and 3–10
graphite layers deep form more extended layered structures with
fewer defects [68,73,192,193,235]. At some fluences extension of
these crystallites includes introduction and migration of five- and
seven-membered ring structures, which allow curvature of these
graphitic layers, such that the primary particles can form carbon-
onion structures with hollow cores [68,73,192,193,235].

Annealing is expected to be exothermic and will thus heat the
particle. A more important contribution from this process is its po-
tential influence on all of the other processes because it changes
the physical structure of the particle on the fine scale. Little is known
about this mechanism, its rate, its energetics, and how it affects other
physical parameters, such as the particle’s optical properties. Al-
though this mechanism could have a very significant impact on LII
signals, it is disregarded in most LII models because so little is known
about how to take it into account. The heating rate for this mech-
anism can generally be expressed as

(cid:2)

−Δ

H k N

N

A

d

,

(20)

where ΔHann is the enthalpy for annealing, kann is the rate constant
for annealing, and Nd is the number of defect sites in the particle.
The one model that includes annealing assumes that the particle
anneals at low temperatures by migration of interstitial atoms that
combine with defects within the graphite planes [177]. The parti-
cle anneals at high temperatures by in-plane vacancy migration. The
number of defects is solved for explicitly. A more detailed descrip-
tion of this mechanism can be found in Ref. 177.

3.1.7. Thermionic emission

Thermionic emission has a relatively small influence on the
particle-cooling rate and is generally disregarded in LII models [205].
One reason to include this mechanism, in addition to accounting
for its impact on the energy balance of the particle, is to under-
stand and predict the charging of the particle caused by laser heating.
The expression for this term is based on a Richardson–Dushman ap-
proximation given by [183,205,236].

a For mature soot at flame temperatures and atmospheric pressure, the low fluence range includes fluences ≤~0.15 J/cm2 at 1064 nm and ≤~0.08 J/cm2 at 532 nm, and the
high fluence range includes fluences above these values [177,187,215,219,237]. These fluence ranges depend on ambient pressure and temperature and particle
composition.

b Conductive cooling and oxidation are less important during sublimation or coating vaporization [130].
c The timing for sublimation depends on particle morphology, size, and composition and laser irradiance. Sublimation becomes important after the particle reaches the

sublimation temperature, which often occurs several microseconds after the particle enters the laser beam but before the particle reaches the center of the beam [130].

3.1.8. Overview of the relative importance of the energy-loss
processes

The result presents the average for this distribution of primary
particles [130].

Table 1 provides an overview of the effects of the mechanisms
involved in the energy and mass balance of the particle. The mecha-
nisms that have the most impact on the energy balance are laser
absorption for heating, conduction and sublimation for cooling, and
sublimation for mass loss. These mechanisms are highlighted in bold
type in Table 1. The main effects on the LII signal for pulsed and CW
LII are listed separately.

For pulsed LII, a critical parameter for defining the influence of
each mechanism is the laser fluence, and the most relevant fluence
ranges for each mechanism are listed in Table 1. The fluence ranges
listed in Table 1 are approximate, as there is a transition from low
fluence to high fluence around a peak soot temperature of about
4000 K, above which sublimation becomes dominant. The rele-
vant fluence ranges depend on a number of factors, such as laser
wavelength, particle maturity, and ambient temperature and pres-
sure. Fig. 9 demonstrates the importance of these mechanisms at
atmospheric pressure, as predicted by an energy- and mass-
balance model [187] that includes all of the mechanisms discussed
in Section 3.1. For these calculations, the model assumed a primary-
particle diameter of 33 nm and used a measured laser temporal
profile with a pulse duration of 8.3 ns (FWHM), a wavelength of
532 nm, and fluences of approx. 0.03 and 1.00 J/cm2. On this
timescale, the shape of the laser profile is approximately repre-
sented by the absorption rate at low fluences, i.e., the blue line in
Fig. 9a. Fig. 10 demonstrates the increasing importance of conduc-
tive cooling with increasing pressure at temperatures below ~4000 K
and the importance of evaporative cooling at higher temperatures.
For CW LII, the integrated absorption over the laser–particle in-
teraction time is relatively high, such that the particle, or most of
it, is expected to reach the sublimation point. For this application
approach, the impact of each mechanism will depend on the state
of the particle as a function of the laser–particle interaction time.
Fig. 11 shows an example of the relative importance of these heating
and cooling mechanisms during the laser–particle interaction time,
as predicted by an LII model that includes all of the mechanisms
described in Section 3.1 [130]. Calculations were performed for a
mature soot particle with a fractal dimension of 1.9, mobility di-
ameter of 126 nm, mass of 0.415 fg, and monodispersed primary-
particle size of 13 nm. The model used a measured laser–particle
interaction time with a laser wavelength of 1064 nm. At atmo-
spheric pressure and room temperature, conductive-heat loss is the
dominant cooling mechanism. The calculations are shown for an
aggregate of primary particles with varying exposed surface area.

3.2. Physical properties and key parameters

In this section we evaluate some of the key parameters used in
LII modeling. Because of both their central role in LII models and
the on-going debate on the actual values to be employed, we will
focus on the thermal accommodation coefficient αT and the optical
absorption function E(m) of the complex index of refraction m, but

length of 532 nm. Adapted from Lemaire and Mobtil [187].

of bath-gas molecules striking the surface can be characterized by
an initial temperature T0. Likewise, the Maxwell–Boltzmann dis-
tribution of states, following interactions with the particle surface,
can be characterized by a final temperature Tf. For a surface tem-
perature of T, the accommodation coefficient is defined as [238]

(22)

When gas-surface collisions are completely elastic, i.e., no energy
is exchanged, this parameter has a value of 0. When gas mol-
ecules are fully equilibrated with the surface during these
interactions, this parameter reaches a value of 1.

No direct measurements have been made of the thermal-
accommodation coefficient with soot, but a few direct measurements
have been made on carbon surfaces, which serve as a good surro-
gate for mature soot. The accommodation coefficient has been
measured to be 0.26 for room-temperature N2 interacting with a
graphite surface at 1220–1270 K [239] and 0.20–0.25 for CH4 in-
teracting with amorphous carbon surfaces at 850 and 1400 K [240].
The latter value is suspicious because CH4 thermally decomposes
at temperatures above 1240 K [241,242]. This process is catalyzed
by carbon surfaces such that decomposition occurs at tempera-
tures closer to 900 K in the presence of carbon black [241,242].
Furthermore, the relevant temperatures for LII measurements often
range from either room temperature (~300 K) or flame tempera-
tures (1700–2000 K) to laser-heated-particle temperatures of 2500–
4000 K. The accommodation coefficient is expected to depend on
surface temperature and gas temperature [238,243], and extrapo-
lating lower temperature measurements of αT to higher temperatures
is difficult without additional information.

Michelsen [244] used state-to-state measurements of NO scat-
tered from graphite surfaces as a function of surface temperature
and incidence energy to derive partial accommodation coeffi-
cients for vibrational, rotational, and translational degrees of freedom.
These partial accommodation coefficients were combined into a
surface-temperature and gas-temperature-dependent global ac-
commodation coefficient, as shown in Fig. 12. Measurements were
made at surface temperatures as high as 700 K and gas tempera-
tures as high as 1650 K. The results were extrapolated to higher
temperatures to yield an estimate of 0.18–0.21 for αT at LII-
relevant surface temperatures and typical flame-gas temperatures.
Although the trends with surface temperature and gas tempera-
ture are consistent with previous measurements for H2, Kr, Xe, and

temperature depends on the pulsed-LII-laser fluence (see Fig. 4b). For particle peak
temperatures below 4000 K in the low-fluence regime, cooling is dominated by con-
ductive cooling; above 4000 K, evaporation/sublimation plays an important role.

will also remark on density ρ and specific heat cs of the particle.
As in most instances in this review, the discussion will be essen-
tially restricted to refractory (i.e., solid) carbonaceous particles, mostly
mature soot. A general overview of the different parameters used
by various groups in the application of LII can be found in Michelsen
et al. [205], where the status in 2007 is reflected. We are especial-
ly interested in the origin of the values in use in order to critically
evaluate their reliability and to ease the way to assessing the ac-
curacy of the values obtained on the basis of past and future
experiments and modeling activities.

3.2.1. Thermal accommodation coefficient

The thermal accommodation coefficient αT is a key parameter
for particle sizing by LII. For conditions under which the domi-
nant cooling mechanism is conduction to the surrounding
atmosphere, αT is central to linking the temperature-decay rate to
primary-particle size in pulsed LII and for distinguishing between
morphology effects and coating effects on signal timing in CW LII
[130]. A similar connection also exists for the particle density ρs and
specific heat cs, but αT has generally been assumed to contribute
more significantly to uncertainties in LII models than other param-
eters. The accommodation coefficient describes the extent to which
gas molecules exchange vibrational, rotational, and translational
energy with a surface during surface-scattering events. Given a
Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution of initial states, the initial energy

A number of studies have produced estimated values for αT from
fits of current models to LII temporal profiles measured under spe-
cific conditions with known (or assumed) particle sizes
[121,168,170,181,182,247,248,250–252]. Kuhlmann et al. [168,252]
have pointed out that LII-inferred values depend strongly on the
heat-transfer model used to derive them. Somewhat detached from
its original physical meaning, the accommodation coefficient may
often be regarded as a central calibration constant in LII particle
sizing. Values of αT used for a vast range of experimental condi-
tions include 0.05–0.5 for a number of monatomic and polyatomic
bath gases [247], 0.1–0.5 for various bath gases [250], 0.20–0.25 for
an aggregate [168,252], 0.22–0.34, depending on particle compo-
sition [248], 0.28 [181] (where the original value of 0.07 given there
results from a deviating definition of αT) and 0.37 for soot in a
laminar diffusion flame [251], 0.38 [182], 0.36–0.44, varying in-
versely with fluence and peak surface temperature [121], 0.38–
0.44 for an isolated primary particle [168,252], and 1.0 [170]. Values
below 0.1 appear to be associated with measurements on polyatomic
gases that tend to thermally decompose at temperatures above
~1000 K [247].

As mentioned above, these values also depend on a number of
other factors. For example, the dependence of αT on soot maturity
is not well established, but recent results from Bladh et al. [218,249]
and López-Yglesias et al. [219] suggest that αT decreases with in-
creasing soot maturity. These results are supported by theoretical
and experimental studies of surface roughening and enhanced gas-
surface energy transfer at graphite surfaces when hydrogen is bound
to the surface [240,253–258]. Michelsen and coworkers [219] derived
an expression for αT that depends on the surface maturity of the
particle. Using this expression, they demonstrated that the previ-
ously unexplained rapid pulsed-LII signal decay over the first ~50
ns after the laser pulse [121,247,248] could be explained by en-
hanced conductive cooling for surfaces with relatively high hydrogen
content, which decreases, as does αT, as the particle surface is oxi-
dized and annealed [219]. The data used to derive this expression
are limited, however, and did not include an easily quantifiable as-
sessment of soot maturity, such as H/C ratio or other metric for long-
range order of the fine structure of the surface; more work is
necessary to verify and quantify the dependence of αT on soot
maturity.

Calculated signal-decay rates for pulsed LII and signal timing for
CW LII are also dependent on associated uncertain parameters, such
as particle density and specific heat. Because the choice of both αT
and heat-transfer model strongly influences particle sizes in-
ferred from measured pulsed-LII temporal profiles, care must be
taken when comparing particle sizes derived from experiments using
different LII models in the analysis.

Although the uncertainties associated with αT are consider-
able, values of this parameter in common use in current LII models
span the relatively narrow range of 0.23–0.37 [205] for mature soot
in a flame with a well-ordered surface fine structure. Numbers ap-
proaching the value of 0.9 used in the original work of Melton [139]
have been inferred for soot at room temperature when the particle-
surface fine structure is disordered [219]. Melton’s value originates
from a corresponding value from McCoy and Cha [208], who in turn
state that, with the choice of this value, their theory “matches the
data of Harbour as reported by Hidy and Brock”.

These large uncertainties in the value of αT have a significant
impact on the accuracy of pulsed-LII-particle sizing and the relia-
bility of analysis of CW-LII-signal timing and shape related to particle
morphology and composition. The impact of these uncertainties

tion of a physically-derived αT that can be incorporated into
appropriate heat-transfer models. A better understanding and de-

CH4 on graphite (see Ref. 244 and references therein), the data avail-
able for such a study are limited, and no data are available to confirm
the high-surface-temperature extrapolation.

Daun and coworkers have performed molecular-dynamics simu-
lations [245,246] to derive αT. The results indicate that the
dependence of the accommodation coefficient on surface temper-
ature is insignificant at surface temperatures above 2400 K, as shown
in Fig. 13 [246]. These results do not extend to surface tempera-
tures that overlap with available data, however, and have not been
confirmed with experiments at these higher temperatures. Never-
theless, the molecular dynamic simulations for rotational and
translational accommodation are qualitatively consistent with the
results shown in Fig. 12 from experimental data extrapolated to
higher temperatures. The results from the molecular-dynamics simu-
lations for monatomic gases suggest that αT increases with increasing
gas temperature [245], which is consistent with the trends in-
ferred from surface scattering measurements [244]. The results for
N2, however, indicate that αT decreases with increasing gas tem-
perature [246], which is inconsistent with surface scattering
measurements [244]. However, the paucity of measurements as a
function of gas temperature makes these trends difficult to confirm.
At ambient pressures greater than or equal to atmospheric pres-
sure and temperatures well below the sublimation temperature of
~4000 K, the pulsed-LII-signal decay rate is believed to be largely
determined by the conductive-cooling rate. Given a model that can
accurately calculate the conductive-cooling rate and pulsed-LII-
signal decay rate for a known primary-particle size, one should be
able to infer the thermal accommodation coefficient from a mea-
sured pulsed-LII-temporal profile, assuming that the accommodation
coefficient is independent of particle-surface temperature, the LII
model is accurate, and there are no other complicating factors. Un-
fortunately most models have difficulties reproducing pulsed-LII-
signal decay rates during the first 50 ns or so [121,247,248], the
thermal accommodation coefficient is likely to be temperature de-
pendent [121,238,243,244], and there are many other ill-defined
factors that influence this decay rate, such as aggregate size
[69,168,207,210–213] and morphology [70,130] (see Section 3.3),
particle composition [218,219,248,249], oxidation and annealing
[177], and other coupled parameters with large uncertainties. These
factors make it challenging to derive a physically meaningful thermal-
accommodation coefficient from pulsed-LII-temporal profiles.

measurement conditions may finally evolve if carefully conducted
experiments are accompanied by, and are used to validate, a com-
bination of molecular dynamics and Monte-Carlo simulations.

3.2.2. Absorption function

The refractive-index function for absorption E(m) is critically im-
portant for calculating laser absorption, and hence particle-
heating rates, i.e., Eq. (8); E(m) is just as important for calculating
radiative emission, i.e., Eq. (10), and hence LII signals, i.e., Eqs. (6)
and (7). This parameter is given by

where m is the complex index of refraction, i.e., m = n – ik.

This parameter is of central importance when calibrating LII
signals for soot-volume-fraction measurements through compari-
son with extinction measurements. This calibration is only valid if
the value of E(m) is the same for the calibration (extinction) and
LII-measurement conditions. This parameter, however, may be sen-
sitive to a number of factors, such as wavelength [118,251,259–262],
particle composition [70,219,248,249,261–263], and particle tem-
perature [118,227], and controlling for some of these factors during
calibration may be difficult.

A wavelength dependence of m imparts a wavelength depen-
dence to E(m). For single-color time-resolved pulsed-LII applications,
uncertainties in the magnitude of E(m) directly affect the pre-
dicted peak temperature and calculated particle-cooling rate, which
determines the particle size inferred. The wavelength dependence
of E(m) is much more critical than its absolute value in two-color
pulsed-LII primary-particle sizing, where temperatures are in-
ferred from fits of the Planck function to measured signal in two
wavelength regions. Under these conditions, uncertainties in the
wavelength dependence of E(m) lead to uncertainties in inferred
particle temperatures [107,119], cooling rates, and inferred primary-
particle sizes.

Because knowledge of the optical properties of soot is also im-
portant for light extinction and scattering measurements of soot in
flames, combustion exhaust streams, and the atmosphere, there is
a wide body of literature covering these properties. We refer the
interested reader to several excellent reviews in this area
[15,264,265]. Here we will focus on particular aspects of these optical
properties directly relevant to LII measurements.

For the determination of E(m) the knowledge of m is sufficient,
but not necessary, and there are several ways to measure E(m). One
way of measuring E(m) is via extinction measurements. The problem
inherent in this approach is that scattering must be taken into
account, as the extinction cross section σext of a particle ensemble
is the sum of the absorption and scattering cross sections, σabs and
σsca, respectively. Although the single-scattering albedo ω = σsca/
σext = σsca/(σsca+σabs) for carbonaceous particles is small under many
conditions, it is non-negligible. Reported values are in the range of
0.19–0.47 in the visible [118,265–269] and 0.006–0.077 at 1064 nm
[118,130], depending on particle size and maturity. Therefore, for
a reliable determination of σabs and E(m) from extinction, scatter-
ing properties have to be considered, which in turn requires an
appropriate description of soot aggregates, typically based on a fractal
approach (see Section 3.3), and knowledge of the refractive-index
function for scattering

To a first approximation, the particle temperature change upon
laser heating, Tmax – T0 (with peak temperature Tmax and initial tem-
perature T0), is directly proportional to E(m), as long as sublimation
and other effects do not play a role. Because the LII signal depends
strongly on particle temperature, the LII signal itself can be used
with an LII model to infer E(m). A number of recent experiments
have addressed the determination of E(m) or its wavelength de-
pendence based directly on LII measurements. One relatively early
example for such an approach is the work of Snelling et al. [251].
From a pyrometric measurement of the soot peak temperature in
a diffusion flame, they found E(m) = 0.42 for 1064 nm under the as-
sumption of a wavelength-independent absorption function and
E(m) = 0.395 when using a linear dependence of E(m) on λ. Later
similar experiments [121] yielded a value of 0.4 for 532 nm exci-
tation in a diffusion flame, and de Iuliis et al. [270] obtained a value
of 0.29 at 1064 nm in a diffusion flame. Beyer and Greenhalgh [184]
performed low-fluence LII measurements under high-vacuum con-
ditions (102 Pa) for particles extracted from a diffusion flame. Because
conductive cooling is greatly reduced under vacuum, where radia-
tive cooling dominates, their experiments had decay times of several
tens of microseconds. From the radiative emission, they were able
to obtain an estimate for an average E(m) value of 0.4 weighted over
the wavelength range of emission.

Measuring LII at two laser wavelengths offers a convenient
method for testing the wavelength dependence of E(m) for these
two wavelengths, as first proposed by Therssen et al. [271]. The idea
is to induce an identical particle temperature increase (a proxy for
total energy absorbed) at two laser wavelengths and to calculate
the E(m) ratio from the ratio of fluences required to achieve this
target temperature change. The identical maximum temperature is
determined by matching the peak LII signal, the signal-decay rate,
or the inferred-particle temperature for the two wavelengths
[118,219,262,263,271,272]. Therssen et al. [271], Michelsen et al.
[118,219,273], and Bejaoui et al. [272] measured values in the range
of about 0.84–1.0 for the ratio E(m, 532 nm)/E(m, 1064 nm) for
mature soot in diffusion and premixed flames.

Because of structural and compositional changes due to varia-
tions in the maturity of the soot, E(m) is expected to change with
height above the burner (HAB), especially in the lower regions of
premixed flames and the central regions of diffusion flames. The ratio
E(m, 532 nm)/E(m, 1064 nm) appears to decrease with increasing
soot maturity, as shown by the results of Cléon et al. [263] (see
Fig. 14) and López-Yglesias et al. [219]. In order to study the effects
of compositional changes of E(m) with HAB in a premixed flame,
Cléon et al. [263] used a low-pressure (~0.03 MPa) premixed CH4/
O2/N2 flame to extend the soot inception zone. As shown in Fig. 14,
they observed a strong decrease in the E(m) ratio for 532 and
1064 nm with increasing HAB until a constant value was reached.
The absolute values, however, for the ratio E(m, 532 nm)/E(m,
1064 nm) found in this low-pressure, premixed flame are excep-
tionally high, exceeding unity, in contrast to investigations in
atmospheric, diffusion and premixed flames. López-Yglesias et al.
[219] observed a similar trend, i.e., a lower E(m) ratio for mature
soot in the edges of co-flow diffusion flames relative to the less
mature soot in the centers of the flames. This approach requires care
to reduce the influences of interferences from LIF [219,263]. In ad-
dition, use of UV wavelengths can yield misleading results because
such wavelengths can lead to photodissociation rather than direct
heating [274,275]. Nevertheless, these results are consistent with
many studies using other techniques that have demonstrated a shift
in the absorption cross section to longer wavelength with increas-
ing soot maturity, i.e., decreasing H/C ratio and increasing percentage
of sp2 hybridization [43,261,276–282].

In the end, the determination of the two refractive-index func-
tions E(m) and F(m) is equivalent to determining both the real and
imaginary parts of m.

In addition to a change in the wavelength dependence of E(m),
the magnitude of E(m) also changes with soot maturity. The ab-
sorption cross section or E(m) increases with increasing soot maturity

[219,248,249,263,277–279,283–285], and a higher laser fluence is
required to bring less mature soot to similar LII-signal levels (for
pulsed LII) and temporal behavior (for CW LII) as more mature soot
[219,248,263,285]. For pulsed LII this dependence results in a shift
in fluence curves (i.e., peak LII vs laser fluence) to higher fluence
with decreasing particle maturity, i.e., increasing hydrogen content
[219,248,285]. Fig. 15a shows results from Bladh et al. [286] who
measured peak pulsed-LII signal at different locations in a pre-
mixed ethylene flame. The peak LII is shifted to higher fluence at
lower heights above the burner (HAB), where the soot is less mature
and particles sizes are smaller, as indicated by faster LII-signal decay
rates (Fig. 15b). This behavior may be entirely attributable to a de-
pendence of the absorption cross section on soot maturity [285] or
to a combination of factors, including changes in density and spe-
cific heat with changes in soot maturity [219]. For a leaner flame,
the peak LII does not reach a plateau and increases nearly linearly,
as shown in Fig. 15c. These results are accompanied by very fast
signal-decay rates that do not change with HAB, as shown in Fig. 15d.
The primary-particle size inferred from these data was ~1 nm [286].
Although unusual, nearly linear fluence curves have been re-
ported previously by Mouton et al. [287] under similar flame
conditions. Bladh et al. [286] suggest that this behavior may be
related to physicochemical transformations of the particles during
laser heating or less efficient laser heating of these small par-
ticles. Identifying the reasons of this behavior will require further
investigation.

In another study Bladh et al. [249] investigated the variation of
E(m) with HAB in a premixed atmospheric flame for an incident
wavelength of 1064 nm by two-color LII and found an increase from
about 0.21 for low positions in the flame (with a corresponding
primary-particle size of about 5 nm) up to 0.45 at large HAB. Eremin
et al. [288] studied the variation of E(m) with particle size during
the formation of carbon (and iron) particles in a shock-tube exper-
iment and found very low values (E(m) ~ 0.05) for the smallest
particles with sizes of a few nanometers increasing up to 0.25 (again
at 1064 nm) for the largest particle (about 20 nm). These results
appear to have large uncertainties, however, because multiple pa-
rameters were varied simultaneously to derive both E(m) and particle

size. In addition, other parameters, such as particle density, could
easily be changing with particle size, and these parameters could
be very strongly coupled to a value for E(m) derived in this manner,
making E(m) more of an empirical fit parameter for these condi-
tions. Values of E(m) depend on soot maturity, and the magnitude
of E(m) and its wavelength dependence can vary dramatically, both
with location within a flame, and between diffusion and pre-
mixed flames (premixed flames tend to produce less mature soot
than diffusion flames). Care should therefore generally be taken to
note the conditions under which E(m) is determined.

With the high temperatures involved in LII measurements, other
effects relevant for absorption must also be considered. Particles may
expand or change in fine structure if annealing occurs. It is far from
trivial to isolate the effects on E(m) from those of other param-
eters, such as size, density, and heat capacity. Michelsen et al. [118]
coupled LII and extinction measurements at laser wavelengths of
532 and 1064 nm to derive the fluence dependence of the scatter-
ing and absorption cross sections at these wavelengths. Their
experimental results indicate that the absorption cross sections in-
crease with increasing fluence until the point at which the particle
starts to sublime (see Fig. 16), and the scattering cross sections de-
crease with increasing fluence. The magnitude of the increase in
absorption cross section is consistent with a swelling of the parti-
cle because of changes in density with temperature, but this trend
could also be attributed to a change in the optical properties of the
particle. Michelsen et al. [118] attributed the scattering trend either
to a change in the optical properties of the particle or to a change
in the morphology of the particle with temperature. Thomson and
coworkers [227,237] confirmed these trends in extinction and scat-
tering cross sections. They attempted to invoke Maxwell Garnett
theory to derive a temperature-dependent E(m), which suggested
that particle expansion could not explain the absorption-cross-
section enhancement with increasing temperature. Maxwell Garnett
theory, however, addresses the problem of calculating an average
index of refraction of a system composed of inclusions, such as soot
particles in a medium, e.g., air [15,289–291], and cannot be used
on a microscopic scale to predict the temperature dependence of
m or E(m) [292]. More work is thus required to provide a full

understanding of the changes in both the absorption and scatter-
ing cross sections with particle temperature.

A large body of work has demonstrated that coatings on soot par-
ticles can have a significant influence on their optical properties.
A non-absorptive coating on a soot particle is expected to in-
crease both the scattering cross section [198,293–295] and the
absorption cross section [264,265,293,295–298]. These predicted
enhancements in scattering and absorption cross sections have been
confirmed experimentally [97,198,299–306]. Aggregate morphol-
ogy may also influence soot optical properties. As the fractal
dimension (i.e., particle compactness) increases, the absorption cross
section is predicted to decrease for fractal dimensions below 2
[15,295,307] and increase for fractal dimensions above 2 [308]. In-
creases in scattering cross sections with increasing fractal dimension
are not well understood; scattering cross sections are predicted to
either increase [308,309] or decrease [15,198,295,310] with in-
creasing fractal dimension. Optical effects of coatings or morphology
could have a considerable influence on the time evolution of CW-
LII signals because particle composition and morphologies can vary
widely for atmospheric application, but more work needs to be done
to confirm such effects.

3.3. Influence of aggregation

In the initial years of development, LII models, including Me-
lton’s [139] original description of the basic LII process, only
considered isolated spherical particles or those in point contact and
neglected effects of aggregation on the various mechanisms in-
volved in LII. The issue of aggregation was originally addressed by

Vander Wal et al. [13], who compared primary-particle sizes in-
ferred from pulsed-LII-signal-decay rates and TEM images at various
heights in diffusion flames and found partial agreement, depend-
ing on the position in the flame, an effect they attributed to the
degree of aggregation. Filippov and Rosner [311] went much further
and argued that under certain conditions, namely, if particles are
in the near-continuum regime, aggregate-size distributions might
be inferred from the decay rates of pulsed-LII temporal profiles. Al-
though no evidence for such an application is known, this statement
highlights the fact that researchers started to think about the in-
fluence of particle structure on LII.

Soot aggregates and many other types of nanoparticles synthe-
sized in flames may be characterized by a fractal-like approach
[18,312–314], where the number Np of primary particles per ag-
gregate can be described by

Here, Df is the fractal dimension, which for soot aggregates is
typically in a range of ~1.7–1.9 [11,14–18], and kf is the fractal
prefactor, a proportionality constant of order unity [15]. Litera-
ture values span a wide range of values for the fractal prefactor
[17,315]. In some cases this spread is due to a different formula-
tion from that expressed in Eq. (25). Experimental results often
yield a value for kf of 1.9–2.8 [18,316,317], which tends to be larger
than that obtained from simulations. The enhanced experimental
value may be attributable to particle overlap found in real aggre-
gates [17,315,318].

weighted absorption cross sections are shown for (a) 532 nm and (b) 1064 nm. The
symbols represent values derived from a combination of extinction and pulsed-LII
measurements. The lines represent predicted increases in the absorption coeffi-
cient with a decrease in density and increase in particle size with increasing
temperature caused by increasing fluence and laser heating. These predictions are
based on values of the thermal-expansion coefficient for polycrystalline graphite (type
7087) and for expansion along the c-axis of single-crystal graphite. Values for in-
tegrated aggregate concentration over the path length Cl were set for best agreement
with the absorption cross sections at the lowest fluences. Reprinted from Michelsen
et al. [118].

Filippov et al. [210] investigated the influence of aggregate size
and morphology on heat-transfer rates for free-molecular and con-
tinuum regimes. The effects of aggregate size on the decay rate of
pulsed-LII signals were later incorporated into LII models, and the
consequent impact on estimations of primary-particle size param-
eters was investigated [212,251]. Liu et al. [207] illustrated that
distributions of both aggregate size and primary-particle size in-
fluence the decay rate of pulsed-LII signals (see Fig. 17). This study
showed that polydispersity in the aggregate size has little impact
in the free molecular regime but becomes important in the tran-
sition regime, and polydispersity in primary-particle diameter in
general is always important and should be considered. Liu et al. [207]
further introduced the concept of the equivalent heat-transfer sphere
to model the effect of shielding on heat conduction between ag-
gregate particles and the surrounding gas.

Apart from the overall aggregate structure, the overlap or bridg-
ing effect needs to be considered in particle sizing by pulsed LII or
assessing LII-signal timing in CW LII as it reduces the surface area
available for conductive-heat transfer. The particle overlap may be
characterized by an overlap parameter C
[17,318],
where dij may be regarded as the distance between the centers of
two particles. For point contact Cov = 0, complete sintering/
coalescence would result in Cov = 1. The value of Cov depends on
formation characteristics and, when measured in a flame, on height
above the burner, but values in the range of Cov ≈ 0.15–0.25 may be
regarded as common for many soot samples [319–321]. Because the
decay rates of pulsed-LII signals depend on the specific-surface area,
such a reduction in free surface directly influences signal-decay rates,
which, in turn, influence inferred primary-particle sizes. If an overlap
parameter is known, this reduction may be calculated in a straight-
forward manner when employing a realistic thermalaccommodation

particle diameter (dp) for conduction in the transition regime (local gas
temperature = 400 K). The model is for low fluence (0.158 J/cm2) pulsed LII at 1064 nm
laser excitation. The calculations indicate that for these conditions both the polydis-
persity of aggregate size and of primary-particle diameter must be considered in
interpreting pulsed-LII signals. Reprinted from Liu et al. [207] with kind permis-

coefficient. If, however, an effective-accommodation coefficient is
used from previous calibration measurements of LII vs TEM data,
this value implicitly takes into account this surface reduction, as long
as the calibration is performed on particles with the same mor-
phology and ambient conditions. As a kind of second-order effect,
bridging between primary particles also influences shielding phe-
nomena in heat transfer, as recently analyzed by Johnsson et al. [214].
Under some conditions, e.g., under fuel-rich premixed combus-
tion conditions and in exhaust streams [322–324], soot aggregates
can have a more compact morphology, which significantly reduces
the effective surface area and can substantially reduce the pulsed-
LII signal-decay rates [70], as demonstrated below.

Generally, the aggregate structure may influence most of the in-
dividual processes introduced in Section 3.1; in practice, however,
these effects only appear to be important for heat conduction and,
to a lesser extent, for the absorption of laser radiation. One would
certainly expect an effect of aggregation on the sublimation process;
the expanding vapor cloud from one particle will interact with that
from a neighboring particle. Why this topic has not been dis-
cussed so far may be explained by the typical conduct of particle-
sizing experiments in the low-fluence regime on the one hand and
by the general difficulty in adequately describing sublimation with
LII on the other hand. As an additional effect, analysis of scatter-
ing signal recorded simultaneously with CW LII suggests that the
radius of gyration of the particle increases significantly during sub-
limation; the effect has been hypothesized to be similar to the
expansion of a kernel of popcorn when the vaporization of water
in the kernel causes the kernel to pop [130].

Light absorption is usually described by the Rayleigh–Debye–
Gans approximation for fractal aggregates (RDG-FA) [15,316], which
postulates that primary particles in an aggregate absorb light in-
dependently of the aggregate, i.e., as if they were isolated particles.
The absorption cross section of an individual primary particle in turn
is simply computed using the Rayleigh approximation, given by Eq.
(8). Several studies, e.g. [21,307,325–329], compared more exact nu-
merical models with the RDG-FA approximation and found that RDG-
FA under-predicts laser absorption for conditions typical for LII by
roughly 10% for a small aggregate of ~100 primary particles with
a fractal dimension less than 2. The resulting effect is equivalent to
that from a corresponding error in the absorption function E(m),

see Section 3.2.2. By Kirchhoff’s law of thermal radiation, emis-
sion of radiation should also be affected by aggregation. Because
radiation provides only a minor contribution to the energy balance
under standard conditions, effects to the energy balance of the par-
ticle may be safely neglected. Aggregation may influence the LII
signal, however, and has been predicted to impart a temperature-
dependent bias in the incandescence [327]. In two-color LII, the
emission properties are differently affected for the two wave-
lengths, but this effect is second-order compared to the wavelength
dependence of the emission function. Liu and Smallwood [211] state
that the effect may be neglected for laminar diffusion flames at at-
mospheric pressures, but may become important when considering
aggregates with broader size distributions and larger primary par-
ticles, such as found in high-pressure flames and atmospheric
particles.

In practice, however, the most important effect of aggregation
to LII applications is the reduced conductive heat transfer. For quan-
tification, a shielding factor η=
is introduced, relating
(cid:2)
Q agg for an aggregate to that from Np in-
the conductive-cooling rate
dependent primary particles. A number of studies, e.g. Refs. 207, 210,
214, 251, and 330, have carried out molecular dynamics simula-
tions to quantify this effect. Although different in the detailed
approach and in their quantitative results, all of these investiga-
tions predict a strong decrease in heat conduction for the initial
addition of primary particles and a leveling off when the aggre-
gate consists of tens or hundreds of monomers (see Fig. 18).

Experimental investigations of the relationship between aggre-
gate size and heat transfer are scarce. In a study with 14 different
carbon blacks, Kuhlmann et al. [168,252] could demonstrate a clear
correlation between the number of primary particles per aggre-
gate and an effective-accommodation coefficient derived from the
comparison of LII and TEM data. Based on Fuchs’s heat-transfer
model [91] and the shielding approach by Snelling et al. [251], they
extrapolated the data to derive a thermal accommodation coeffi-
cient for an isolated particle of αT = 0.38 ± 0.03. Bladh et al. [69] used
aggregates from a soot generator based on a propane diffusion flame
with similar primary particles but various degrees of aggregation
and could qualitatively demonstrate reduced heat conduction with
increasing aggregation.

Fig. 19. Pulsed-LII temporal profiles for aggregates with the same mean number of
primary particles and different aggregate morphologies. Particles were heated to the
same peak temperature with a laser fluence of 0.15 J/cm2 at 1064 nm. Profiles were
recorded for particles with an average fractal dimension of ~1.9 (solid line) and an
average fractal dimension of ~2.4 (dotted line). Example TEM images for these par-
ticles are shown as insets. Adapted from Bambha et al. [14,70].

Because of this shielding effect, the fractal dimension also in-
fluences the conductive-cooling rate. More compact aggregates
have a smaller effective surface area. Bambha et al. [70,130] have
shown that the conductive-cooling rates and pulsed-LII-signal
decay rate can be substantially reduced for aggregates with larger
fractal dimensions. They extracted soot from a co-flow diffusion
flame, size-selected it for a mean aggregate size of 150 nm, cooled
it, coated it with oleic acid, and then removed the coating in a
thermodenuder, which caused the aggregates to become more
compact, increasing the fractal dimension from an average of 1.9
for the uncoated particles (Fig. 19, inset) to 2.3–2.4 for the coated-
denuded particles (Fig. 19, inset). The curves in Fig. 19 show a
comparison of pulsed-LII temporal profiles for uncoated and pro-
cessed (compact) particles and demonstrates the change in pulsed-
LII-signal-decay rate caused by the aggregate morphology change.
The compact particles have a much lower conductive-cooling and
signal-decay rate.

Such shielding effects can also influence CW-LII signals. Fig. 20
shows average CW-LII temporal profiles from an SP2 using parti-
cle distributions generated in the same way as those used for the
study shown in Fig. 19 [130]. Because the SP2 measures single par-
ticles, it is possible to identify the particle size associated with a
specific temporal profile, which enables studies of aggregate-size
effects. Conductive cooling competes very effectively with absorp-
tive heating on timescales relevant for CW LII in the SP2
configuration. Particle shielding reduces conductive-cooling rates
and leads to more rapid heating of particles, which shifts LII tem-
poral profiles to earlier times. Fig. 20 shows that the leading edge
of the LII temporal profile appears earlier for more compact and
larger aggregates. Bambha and Michelsen [130] were able to re-
produce these CW-LII temporal profiles with an LII model that
explicitly accounted for a distribution of surface areas for primary
particles in an aggregate. The results of this study demonstrate in-
creased shielding with increasing aggregate size and fractal
dimension.

3.4. Influence of coatings

Soot particles released into exhaust streams can be coated with
semi-volatile liquid coatings condensed onto the surface, which can

be composed of a number of components, including unburned fuel,
lube oil, sulfuric acid, water, and other combustion by-products [331].
Fresh uncoated soot particles are hydrophobic, but particles emitted
into the atmosphere can accumulate semi-volatile coatings that can
allow them to become hygroscopic and effective cloud condensa-
tion nuclei [2]. Following aging in the atmosphere, soot particles
can have a very broad range of coatings, which can affect their optical
properties and optical-detection methods, such as LII. Non-absorptive
coatings on soot particles have been shown to increase scattering
and absorption cross sections (see Section 3.2.2). Coatings on soot
particles have also been demonstrated to lead to significant
changes in particle morphology. As detailed above, uncoated
mature-soot particles have a branched-chain morphology typical-
ly described by a fractal dimension of 1.7–1.9 [11,14–18]. When
coated with oxygenated hydrocarbons or sulfuric acid, this mor-
phology changes such that the particles collapse, the fractal
dimension increases, and the mobility diameter decreases
[16,70,96,198,299,300,302,303,305,306,332–335]. Depending on the
coating, these changes are either reversible [300] or irreversible
[70,300,302,305,334,335] when the coating is removed by a
thermodenuder.

Volatile coatings can also have an effect on LII signals
[70,97,129,198,336,337]. Case and Hofeldt [336] speculated that vol-
atile coatings found on engine-exhaust particles could reduce LII
signals at low laser fluences. Witze and coworkers [198,337] used
a modification of the LII model of Michelsen [177] to predict the
effects of coatings on pulsed-LII signals. Their modeling results con-
firmed the hypothesis of Case and Hofeldt [336] and predicted that
volatile coatings will have a significant influence on the magni-
tude of the pulsed-LII signal at low laser fluences and very little effect
at high laser fluences. Preliminary experimental results with coat-
ings of sulfuric acid confirmed these predictions [337] and indicated
that the additional energy needed to volatilize the coating delays
the heating of the particle to incandescence temperatures. At low
fluences a large fraction of the available laser energy is used to
remove the coating, whereas at high fluences there is plenty of

Fig. 21. CW-LII and ELS temporal profiles are shown for single-carbon particles in-
jected into the cavity of a CW 1064-nm beam. Results are for (a) an uncoated glassy-
carbon particle with a diameter of 600 nm (reproduced from Fig. 5 for reference and
adapted from Moteki et al. [131,132]) and (b) a colloidal-graphite particle coated
with oleic acid with a core-particle diameter Dc of 110 nm and total particle diam-
eter Dp of 500 nm. The same laser–particle interaction profile is displayed in each
panel for reference and was estimated by measuring scattering signal from a non-
absorbing polystyrene sphere [131]. The timing between the laser profile and the
LII signal is not known. Adapted from Moteki and Kondo [131].

energy in the laser pulse to remove the coating and heat the par-
ticle to the sublimation temperature.

Similar results have been obtained for CW LII [97,129]. Under
these conditions there is typically plenty of energy to remove a
coating and heat the particle to the sublimation temperature, but
the process happens over microseconds. Moteki and Kondo [129]
demonstrated that the effect of the coating for these studies is to
delay the onset of LII signal in time until the coating has vapor-
ized. An example of this effect is shown in Fig. 21. The results for
an uncoated particle (shown in Fig. 5) are reproduced in Fig. 21a for
reference. This figure shows that a coating of ~195 nm of oleic acid
causes the LII to shift to later times relative to the scattering signal
[129,131].

Bambha et al. [70] have recently demonstrated that coatings of
oleic acid on flame-generated soot shift the fluence curves for pulsed
LII to higher fluence, i.e., higher fluences are required to heat the
particles to a particular temperature when a coating is applied to
the particle, as shown in Fig. 22a. The curves shift to higher fluence
with increasing coating thickness until the coating is heavy enough
(>~75% by mass) that the laser-heated particles do not fully vapor-
ize the coating, at which point the curves start to shift to lower
fluence with increasing coating thickness, as shown in Fig. 22b. The
restructuring of the particle with coating is nearly reversible if a
laser removes the coating. The coatings must be heavy enough for
rapid vaporization to forcefully open the particle, a process that also
leads to particle fragmentation of primary-particle chains from the
aggregate. Denuded particles shift to slightly lower fluences; the
reason for this enhanced LII signal is likely the reduction in
conductive-cooling rate, caused by the reduction in the effective
surface area, as discussed in Section 3.3.

interfere with LII measurements at wavelengths of 360–440 nm
[338]. Although LIF from PAHs and other species is commonly
assumed to be red-shifted relative to the excitation wavelength, the
fluorescence can be shifted to the blue if multi-photon excitation
is involved or the fluorescing species end up in a lower rovibronic
state than the one in which they started, i.e., they are anti-Stokes
shifted [116,152,338,348–351]. Polarization-discrimination ap-
proaches can be used to reduce LIF interferences from species such
as PAHs [116].

4.1.2. Laser fluence

The LII signal depends nonlinearly on the particle temperature.
For pulsed LII at low fluences, the maximum temperature reached
by the particle is approximately linearly dependent on the laser
fluence, i.e., ignoring minor heating and cooling mechanisms during
laser heating, the maximum temperature reached Tmax can be ap-
proximated by [118, 169]

where FL is the laser fluence. For CW LII, conductive cooling is always
competing with absorptive heating, and the expression to deter-
mine the peak LII signal is more involved. Assuming that the specific
heat is constant over this temperature range, performing the inte-
gration, substituting Eqs. (5) and (8) for the diameter and absorption
cross section, and rearranging gives [285]

The LII-signal magnitude increases nonlinearly with fluence until
the particle reaches the sublimation temperature. The peak of the
time-resolved signal becomes independent of fluence above the
fluence at which Tmax reaches the sublimation point. As shown in
Eq. (27), the peak LII signal reached increases with fluence, and the
fluence at which this plateau is reached depends on the laser wave-
length, the initial particle temperature, and the particle composition,
which determines E(m), ρs, and cs [118,219,262,263,271,272,285].
An example of the fluence dependence of the peak pulsed-LII signal
and Tmax is shown in Fig. 4 for laser wavelengths of 532 and 1064 nm.
At high fluences, the peak-pulsed-LII signal is independent of
fluence for a laser beam with a homogeneous spatial distribution,
but the signal-decay rate increases nonlinearly with fluence because
the sublimation rate increases with increasing fluence. At these
fluences, the gated-LII signal decreases because of the rapid decay
rate. The fluence dependence of a gated signal thus depends on the
gate width and timing relative to the laser. A gated signal tends to
increase with fluence, reach a plateau (at ~0.2 J/cm2 at 1064 nm),

the LII temporal profile is plotted relative to laser fluence on a log scale for (a) low
to moderate coating thickness and (b) heavy coating thickness, as indicated in the
legend as percent coating by mass. All curves corresponding to the denuded par-
ticles are indicated by dotted lines. Adapted from Bambha et al. [70].

4. Implementation of LII

4.1. Excitation

4.1.1. Laser wavelength

LII is typically initiated with a visible or near-infrared (IR) laser,
largely because of the ready availability of high-energy lasers in these
wavelength regions. The fundamental and second harmonic of the
Nd:YAG laser are the most common wavelengths used, but longer
wavelengths have been successfully employed [134]. The shorter
the excitation wavelength and the higher the laser fluence, the higher
is the probability of fluorescence from electronically excited evapo-
rated species or from the gas-phase environment, and thus IR
wavelengths are generally preferred. The suppression of interfer-
ing signal is simplified with excitation in the near infrared. In an
unknown experimental situation it is helpful to check the emis-
sion spectra of the signal before choosing detection filters to ensure
that no strong molecular emission bands are visible within the de-
tection range on top of the broadband LII signal (e.g. Refs. 120, 160,
338, and 339). Wavelengths in the visible and ultraviolet (UV) region
can excite electronic states of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
(PAHs), which then emit broadband fluorescence, particularly when
the PAHs are vibrationally and rotationally hot, e.g. Refs. 340–345.
UV wavelengths can lead to fluorescence from a host of other species,
e.g. Ref. 346, and references therein. Far UV wavelengths have been
shown to preferentially lead to photodissociation of soot over par-
ticle heating and incandescence [274,275].

Recommended filter wavelength ranges for soot detection are
shown in Table 2. These spectral regions are generally chosen to
eliminate the most prominent spectral interferences in soot mea-
surements, which arise from Swan-band emission from excited C2
at 468, 516, 550, and 580–620 nm [152,338,347]. High fluences can
lead to soot sublimation and interferences from C2 Swan-band

and decrease at higher fluences (>0.2 J/cm2 at 1064 nm)
[67,117,178,213]. Volume-fraction measurements are often made in
the plateau region; this approach makes the experiment less sen-
sitive to shot-to-shot variability in the laser energy and to attenuation
through the sample. High laser fluences also make the pulsed-LII
measurements less sensitive to particle coatings [70]. An alterna-
tive approach is two-color LII, which usually employs lower fluence
but measures particle temperature directly, compensating for
changes in laser energy and the presence of coatings. Particle-
sizing measurements tend to be made at low fluences to avoid the
complications of sublimation and large changes in particle size during
the laser pulse.

4.1.3. Laser spatial profile

The laser spatial profile can have a significant effect on the LII
signal. From the perspective of signal analysis, a top-hat (i.e., ho-
mogeneous) spatial profile is conceptually the most straightforward
configuration to implement because all particles at any point in the
detection volume will receive the same laser fluence (see the inset
in Fig. 1), but a top-hat profile may not be the simplest beam profile
to use in practice. Some high-energy pulsed lasers generate a Gauss-
ian or quasi-Gaussian profile, and the beam used for CW LII is also
Gaussian. Such a profile can be turned into a top-hat in pulsed LII
by selecting the center of the beam with an aperture or by using a
specially designed beam shaper. A top-hat profile will distort as it
is propagated in free space. As shown in Fig. 1, a series of two-
lens telescopes can be employed to relay the image of the aperture
or beam-shaper output to the detection volume without diffrac-
tion effects [352]. Although the beam will be collimated at the
detection volume, the final image will have a finite depth of field.
Starting with a Gaussian or quasi-top-hat multimode or injection-
seeded high-energy pulsed laser and employing relay imaging of
an aperture has been effectively demonstrated to produce a top-
hat profile that is maintained over a depth-of-field of several
millimeters [70,113,116,285,353,354].

For pulsed-LII volume-fraction measurements at high fluences,
a one-dimensional Gaussian (i.e., sheet) profile can provide gated
signals that are nearly independent of fluence [35,117,148,160,178].
For a two-dimensional (i.e., cylindrically symmetric Gaussian) beam,
gated pulsed-LII signals have been shown to increase monotoni-
cally with increasing fluence [24,151,174,178,355]. The signal will
decrease in the high-intensity center of the beam with increasing
fluence as the particles sublime. At the same time the signal will
increase in the low-intensity wings of the beam where particles have
not reached the sublimation point [174,178,355,356]. This effect was

demonstrated by Delhay et al. [356] who recorded pulsed-LII signal
in a backward configuration collinear with the laser beam. An
example of their results is shown in Fig. 23 for several laser pulse
energies using a Gaussian laser-beam spatial profile at 1064 nm. At
the lowest laser energy, the maximum signal is seen at the peak
of the laser spatial profile in the center of the beam. With increas-
ing pulse energy, the region with detectable LII signal increases in
size, and, at a high laser-pulse energy (right panel), the maximum
intensity is moved to the wings of the laser spatial profile. These
effects often compensate for each other for a Gaussian sheet. There
is a higher fraction of low-intensity wings for a cylindrical Gauss-
ian profile, and such a profile typically generates a gated signal that
does not reach a plateau and continues to increase with increas-
ing fluence [24,151,174,178,355]. Bladh et al. [213] have shown that
a top-hat profile is predicted to yield the least error in soot-volume-
fraction measurements with gated detection at low fluences, and
a two-dimensional Gaussian beam gives slightly less error than a
top-hat or Gaussian sheet at high fluences (see Fig. 24).

4.1.4. Laser temporal and spatio-temporal profile

The vast majority of pulsed-LII measurements are made using
high-energy pulsed Nd:YAG lasers with a 7–10 ns pulse duration.
Many of these lasers are multimode, and temporal profiles tend to
exhibit considerable mode structure. An example is shown in Fig. 25
for a laser with an unstable-resonator-cavity design; multimode
lasers with stable resonators may exhibit even more complex mode
structure [358]. This mode structure is random and varies from shot
to shot. Injection seeding the laser provides a smooth temporal
profile, which is compared with the multimode profile in Fig. 25.
At low fluences the multimode structure has little effect on the LII
signal. At high fluences the mode structure on the laser pulse leads
to a minor decrease (of <10% for most fluences) in the average LII
signal [357]. For most LII applications, an injection-seeded laser is
not necessary. Injection seeding is only important if the data are
being collected to validate a time-dependent LII model or study the
fine details of the temporal evolution of the LII signal.

There are a large number of mechanisms that can influence LII-
signal generation, and understanding these processes in detail
requires collecting data under a wide range of conditions. Such data
are necessary for validating LII models. Shorter pulses may be useful
in isolating heating and cooling processes that naturally occur on
different timescales. Michelsen [354] used the second harmonic of
a Nd:YAG laser with a 65-ps pulse duration and a streak camera with
an 8-ps temporal resolution to study the time evolution of the signal
on a shorter timescale. Relative to the laser pulse the LII signal
behaves in time very similarly to the typical nanosecond LII. The
results suggest, however, that such short laser pulses may be more
susceptible to generating interferences by multiphoton absorp-
tion [354]. Pulses with femtosecond durations can lead to electronic
excitation on a timescale shorter than that at which electrons can
thermalize with the lattice and heat the particle. In a bulk solid this
process initiates rapid local heating and localized material abla-
tion [359]. In a nanoparticle, significant ionization can occur, which
can cause Coulomb explosion at high laser fluences [360]. Kaldvee
et al. [361] recently used picosecond LII for enhanced range reso-
lution in a single-ended detection geometry.

For volume-fraction measurements, a laser with a longer pulse
duration may be more effective. Stephens et al. [133] developed an
approach based on intracavity irradiation of single particles in-
jected into the cavity of a CW laser. This approach allows particles
to be heated to the sublimation point using a compact laser system.
Fig. 5 shows an example of LII and ELS temporal profiles com-

doubled, injection-seeded Nd:YAG laser with an unstable-resonator-cavity design)

pared with the laser–particle interaction time using such a system.
The laser interaction time is determined by measuring the laser
scatter from a non-absorbing particle as it drifts through the laser
beam; this drift time is on the order of microseconds. The long in-
teraction time provides sufficient signal for detection of single
particles.

This approach to CW LII tends to be impractical for combus-
tion systems where in situ measurements in flames, engine cylinders,
or other combustors are required. The current implementation of
this technique also provides reduced sensitivity to soot particles with
a fractal dimension of 1.8 and a mobility diameter less than ~140 nm
(see Sections 4.2.3 and 5.4), which makes it undesirable for most
combustion measurements. Ditaranto et al. [362] performed pulsed-
LII measurements on soot in a flame using a laser with a variable
pulse length and temporal profile. Their results demonstrate ex-
tended generation of LII over the pulse duration of up to 900 ns.
These LII temporal profiles display interesting and unexpected be-
havior, i.e., a second unexplained temporal mode, which will require
further investigation to characterize and understand. Black [363]
demonstrated that a 1060 nm fiber laser with a high-repetition-
rate CW-equivalent power of 100 W could be used to measure LII
from soot in the exhaust of an aero-engine.

The high-energy pulsed Nd:YAG lasers typically used for LII mea-
surements employ a cavity design with a geometrically unstable
resonator configuration. This laser cavity is usually coupled with
variable-reflectivity mirrors to produce high quality beam profiles
[352]. This cavity design has been shown to generate a spatial profile
that varies throughout the pulse [353,364–366]. The timing of the
pulse varies by nanoseconds with radial position in the beam. The
center of the beam emerges from the laser first, and the edges of
the beam can be delayed from the center by more than 10 ns. Pas-
sively Q-switched stable resonators and microchip lasers demonstrate
similar spatio-temporal beam-profile behavior [367,368]. The time-
dependent transverse-mode structure in a multimode laser can also
lead to evolution of the spatio-temporal profile with time, but this
behavior is less predictable and is more complex for a stable res-
onator than for an unstable resonator [358]. Evolution of the spatio-
temporal profile during the laser pulse can have a substantial effect
on time-resolved LII and elastic scattering measurements if not taken
into account in the analysis or measurement design [353].

4.2. Detection

LII detection depends to a large extent on the purpose of the
measurements. Volume-fraction measurements are typically
derived from the intensity information of time-integrated pulsed-
LII measurements or accumulated histograms of peak CW-LII signals
from individual particles. These measurements are implemented
differently from pulsed-LII particle-size measurements based on
time-resolved (TiRe-LII) measurements. An alternative approach
is the absolute-intensity method, which employs time-resolved
measurements at multiple wavelengths in the measurement of
concentration (mass and volume), specific-surface area, and primary-
particle diameter. Additionally, the approach for measurements of
point-wise information is different from the approach used for
one or two-dimensional imaging. Furthermore, there is a choice
between single- and two- (and even three-) color measurements
with the purpose of accurately determining particle temperature
from pyrometry. In strongly absorbing environments, additional
detection of attenuation or local-light intensity (through extinc-
tion measurements and measurements of local elastic scattering)
has been used to evaluate local laser fluences. In all these ap-
proaches, choices must be made concerning integration times,
time resolution of detectors, and detection-wavelength ranges,
which can depend on the measurement situation. In strongly

26

H.A. Michelsen et al./Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 51 (2015) 2–48

attenuating environments, effects of signal trapping on the results
should be investigated.

4.2.1. Volume and mass fraction

For many initial applications of LII, the main focus was on the
determination of the soot-volume fraction. Signal was collected
on a photomultiplier tube (PMT), resulting in point measure-
ments [139,151]. One-dimensional line images were acquired in
turbulent flames via line-imaging onto a camera [150]. A common
approach for pulsed LII, however, uses two-dimensional imaging
with a gated intensified CCD camera equipped with appropriate
detection filters, which detects signal from a plane illuminated by
a laser-light sheet (e.g. Ref. 24). Typical detector arrangements are
orthogonal to the laser direction, at an oblique angle to increase
the measurement volume [108], or in backward geometry for single-
ended applications, such as the detection in exhaust plumes of jet
engines [38]. Kaldvee et al. [361] recently investigated the use of
LII for volume-fraction measurements in a configuration for
range-resolved single-ended detection using LII on a picosecond
timescale.

The underlying reason for the approximate proportionality
between the maximum LII signal and soot-volume fraction is
derived from the fact that soot primary particles are volume ab-
sorbers and emitters, i.e., in the Rayleigh approximation the energy
absorbed and emitted by them scales with volume and not with
surface as for macroscopic objects (see Section 3.1.2). If all par-
ticles reach the maximum signal at the same peak temperature
(i.e., the sublimation point), the peak signal will correlate with the
volume or mass of the particle. Melton’s original analysis of pulsed
LII [139] included some dependence of signal magnitude on par-
ticle size, and relevant experimental parameters and conditions
must be controlled or taken into account [113] to obtain a depend-
able measure for volume fraction. For gated pulsed-LII
measurements, the choice of the detection gate width and timing
relative to the laser pulse are important. To discriminate LII signal
against LIF, e.g., from C2 or PAHs, and elastically scattered laser light,
delayed detection (relative to the laser pulse) has been suggested.
The comparably long pulsed-LII-signal decay can then be sepa-
rated from luminescence from short-lived excited states and
scattering [149,163]. However, experimental [117,154,213,369] and
theoretical work [155,370,371] showed that long or delayed de-
tection gates bias the LII signal toward the contribution from large
particles because the signal from the small particles decays faster.
Therefore, the most common compromise is to discriminate against
interfering signals spectrally with appropriate filters, to use a laser
wavelength in the near infrared (1064 nm), and to use short (<
50 ns) detection gates that overlap with the laser pulse (i.e., prompt
detection). Using short-gate times is also desirable for high-
pressure applications [178,222]. Conductive-cooling rates increase
with increasing ambient pressure and decreasing ambient temper-
ature, thus speeding up the LII-signal decay rates and reducing the
time-integrated intensity [178,222]. Furthermore, for time-
integrated detection, if calibrations are carried out under conditions
that are different from the ambient application conditions, long
and delayed-detection gates deteriorate the validity of the calibra-
tion [178]. However, with short-gate times imperfections in the
performance of gated detectors can have an influence on the signal
integration and hence the resulting volume-fraction information
[372,373].

Measuring the soot-volume fraction fV based on the pulsed-LII
signal intensity relies heavily on the knowledge of the depen-
dence of the signal on laser fluence and of the local laser fluence
itself. The dependence of pulsed-LII signal on the laser fluence is
nonlinear and complicated (see Figs. 2, 3, 4, 15, and 22) and might
vary with the maturity of the soot and may therefore change as a
function of height above the burner or with particle composition

between flame and exhaust measurements [286,287]. A calibra-
tion against alternative measurements (such as laser extinction or
electron microcopy) is not universal for a wide variety of measure-
ment situations. Common understanding is that, if fluence curves
are similar everywhere in the zone of interest, a fixed proportion-
ality factor between the LII signal and fV can be assumed. If this
requirement is not met (e.g., Figs. 15 and 22), correcting for the com-
positional effects of the fluence dependence of the signal is a
challenge.

In measurement situations with significant laser attenuation,
the local laser fluence changes, and, for relating measured signals
to fV, information about laser attenuation is necessary or highly
desirable for reconstructing the local laser fluence and thus cor-
recting the detected pulsed-LII signal. Approaches that use the local
pulsed-LII signal as a measure of the local laser attenuation for
corrections in a post-processing step provide an experimentally
simple method, that is, however, based on many assumptions
[156,374]. Measurements of the total attenuation of the beam after
passing through the interaction volume cannot fully correct for local
variations of the laser fluence and their nonlinear influence on the
LII signal. For relatively low levels of attenuation, one does not need
to be concerned about the influence of attenuation on laser fluence.
Measuring attenuation in an LII-experiment may not only help in
monitoring the laser fluence, but can also serve as calibration for
LII and offer additional information when combined with elastic
scattering. The RAYLIX technique introduced by Bockhorn, Suntz,
and co-workers [163,375], see Fig. 26, records both variations in
the light sheet intensity for fluence control and local extinction
for the calibration of the LII-signal, and uses this information in a
further step to evaluate particle number densities and sizes from
simultaneous measurement of two-dimensional Rayleigh scatter-
ing and LII.

Using laser fluences in the plateau zone (see Sections 4.1.2
and 4.1.3), where the pulsed-LII signal appears independent
of the laser fluence, is a pragmatic way to circumvent the require-
ment of knowing local laser fluences. A plateau in fluence
dependence of the pulsed-LII signal can be reached with
Gaussian laser beams through the counteracting effects of a de-
creasing signal per unit fV in the center of the laser beam as the
particles sublime and the increasing size of the detection volume
signal increases at the periphery of the beam (see Section 4.1.3).
This method is frequently applied in practical situations for mea-
suring fV where laser attenuation is substantial and difficult to assess,
e.g., due to strong spatial fluctuations of the soot distribution. In
turbulent flames beam steering and trapping may be so signifi-
cant that, even when working in the high-fluence regime,
considerable effects on the derived soot concentration may result.
Sun et al. [376] report on a possible underestimation in soot volume
fractions of up to 30% in an atmospheric turbulent jet-flame. Fig. 27
shows images of the spatial profile of a laser sheet beam after passing
through an air jet (Fig. 27a) and through a turbulent flame
(Figs. 27b–f).

To address some of the limitations with high-fluence pulsed LII
that have been identified, a low-fluence pulsed-LII technique,
autocompensating LII (AC-LII) can be applied. AC-LII employs time-
resolved two-color pyrometry, low laser fluence, and an absolute-
intensity calibration [107,196,370]. AC-LII measures the soot-
particle temperature with two-color time-resolved pyrometry (see
Section 4.2.2). Absolute calibration of the entire detection system,
from the probe volume to the PMT, is achieved by placing a source
of known and traceable spectral radiance at the probe-volume lo-
cation and recording the signals on the PMTs [107]. This approach
results in a calibration factor for each PMT that relates the mea-
sured signal to units of spectral radiance (W m–3 sr–1). With the
absolute-intensity calibration and the temperature, fV is deter-
mined as [370]

formed into light sheets. The first, weaker sheet is used for Rayleigh scattering and extinction, which is measured through the fluorescence signals from a dye solution in
cuvettes before and after the sheet passes through the flame. These signals are recorded in the outer regions of the camera capturing the scattered light. The second light
sheet is employed for pulsed LII recorded by a second camera. Figure courtesy of R. Suntz.

where Ω is the absolute-intensity-calibration factor, and wb is the
width of the laser beam in the sample volume. The mass concen-
tration can be determined by multiplying the soot-volume fraction
by the soot-material density, ρs. This technique allows determina-
tion of the soot-volume fraction and mass concentration without
the need to correlate the result to another measurement of soot,
such as extinction.

The use of low fluence (peak temperatures below 4000 K) in AC-
LII ensures that substantial sublimation of the soot is avoided. The
direct measurement of soot-particle temperature is necessary to
permit the use of low fluence, as the LII signal varies dramatically
with fluence in the low-fluence regime. However, by measuring time-
resolved temperatures on a shot-by-shot basis, the technique
automatically compensates for any effect that could cause a change
in the peak-soot-particle temperature reached during the LII process.

Possible effects that cause variations in the measurement environ-
ment include fluctuations in local bath-gas temperature, laser energy,
attenuation of the laser beam, and the presence and quantity of con-
densed volatile material. To ensure that all soot particles are exposed
to the same laser fluence and thus heated to the same peak tem-
perature, methods described in Section 4.1.3 are applied to generate
a homogeneous laser-beam spatial profile.

CW-LII measurements are also generally made in the plateau
region to ensure that particles reach the sublimation point. Using
lower laser powers tends to reduce sensitivity to smaller particles
and to particles with semi-volatile coatings [126,377]. For CW LII
compositional effects are a particularly serious challenge. Little work
has been done to assess interference effects, and particle coatings
have been shown to have a significant influence on temporal pro-
files [97,128,129]. The peak signal is used to measure particle size
and mass fraction, and the impact of composition on the peak signal
is currently not well understood. Instrument calibrations are often
performed with materials, such as agglomerated-fullerene par-
ticles, that do not mimic the composition and fine structure of

combustion-generated particles, and these materials can give widely
varying results [109–111]. Routine calibration with combustion-
generated particles, e.g., Diesel exhaust, is also cause for concern
because the composition of these particles is not well controlled
and can be highly variable [110].

4.2.2. Primary-particle size

Determination of primary-particle sizes or primary-particle-
size distributions with pulsed LII is based on the particle-cooling
rate after laser heating, which results in a primary-particle-size de-
pendent decay rate of the LII signal, measured using time-resolved
detection (TiRe-LII) [36,158,167]. Other early applications that used
this time-dependent signal variation focused on the two-dimensional
detection of the LII signal at two different delay times after the laser
pulse with two gated cameras [36,158,167]. Because cooling rates
depend on the specific surface area, the ratio of the signal de-
tected at two different delay times is mainly determined by primary-
particle size. At high laser fluences, signal decay rates may be strongly
affected by sublimation of particles. Because of the uncertainties
in modeling sublimation, measurements for primary-particle size
should preferably be carried out in the low-fluence regime. In this
regime, particle cooling is dominated by heat conduction. With heat
conduction dominating, the temperature decay of an isolated primary
particle may well be approximated by a simple exponential decay
as the change of temperature with time is proportional to the tem-
perature difference between the particle and the bath gas. The
situation is more complicated for the LII signal decay, yet under
certain conditions a single-exponential decay may be regarded as
a first rough estimate as well [169]. Cenker et al. [378] have re-
cently evaluated the errors introduced by applying this single-
exponential approximation under various conditions.

In low-fluence LII the initial signal-decay rate is sometimes faster
than expected based on current LII models. This effect has been called
“anomalous cooling”, and the reasons for this behavior are cur-
rently not well understood [121,247,248]. One explanation for this
behavior is that the thermal accommodation coefficient and, hence,
the conductive-cooling rate is enhanced for surfaces with relative-
ly high hydrogen content; this enhancement decreases as the particle
surface is oxidized and annealed while the particle is hot, i.e., during
the initial part of the decay curve [219]. As a consequence, the initial
part of the signal curve is sometimes neglected in the analysis.

The evaluation of the signal decay requires knowledge of the peak
temperature, which is either calculated based on the soot absorp-
tion properties (see Section 3.1.2) or inferred from a pyrometric
measurement of the particle temperature (see below). The deter-
mination of primary-particle sizes is generally complicated by
particle aggregation (see Section 3.3). If the aggregates are within
the RDG-FA limit, large and small particles within these aggre-
gates are heated up to the same final temperature, as suggested by
Eq. (27). The measured or simulated temperature is then valid for
all particles in the probe volume, provided that the probe volume
is homogeneously illuminated. For some researchers, this assump-
tion is an essential element of their analysis, and all particles are
assumed to cool down from the same temperature. With increas-
ing delay after the laser pulse, however, a dispersion in temperature
develops because of the size-dependent cooling rates, and the mea-
sured effective temperature is biased by the larger primary particles
[207].

Primary-particle sizes are generally inferred by comparison of
measured pulsed-LII signal decays with simulated ones based on
an LII model, e.g. Refs. 167, 181, 182, 186, and 218. Determining the
distribution of primary-particle sizes from the decay rate of the
pulsed-LII signal, however, is an ill-posed problem because very dif-
ferent distributions may result in similar signal traces. As pointed
out in Ref. 113, the mathematical reason for this ambiguity is that
a superposition of similar nearly exponentially decaying functions

Fig. 28. Comparison of primary-particle sizes derived from TEM and pulsed LII.
Primary-particle sizes derived from TEM images (gray bars) and fit with a lognor-
mal distribution (black lines) are shown for selected HABs in an atmospheric ethylene–
air co-flow diffusion flame. Primary-particle sizes derived from pulsed-LII temporal
profiles are shown for analyses assuming a monodisperse-size distribution (green
dashed lines) and accounting for an extreme of large (red dashed lines) and small
(blue dashed lines) particles (see text). Reprinted from Cenker et al. [378] with kind

yields an almost exponential decay. During cooling, a particle en-
semble with an initially homogeneous temperature distribution
becomes inhomogeneous. Small particles cool faster than large ones,
and, therefore, the late decay is determined by the large particle
fraction. Rather than a direct inversion, the usual approach in time-
resolved LII is to use a parameterization of the distribution and to
determine the characteristic parameters of such a distribution.

For primary-particle sizes, lognormal-size distributions are re-
garded as a good approximation for various flame conditions
[35,113,215,223,379], and the distribution is typically narrow
[320,380]. However, a lognormal-size distribution may not always
be the best assumption. Normal distributions are also often em-
ployed. Banerjee et al. [381] recently pointed out that multi-
lognormal distributions may show better agreement for some specific
environments. Several approaches have been developed that cor-
relate characteristic parameters of a distribution, e.g., the count-
median diameter (CMD) and the width of the distribution (σ), with
coefficients from a fit to the LII signal decay, e.g. Refs. 215, 378, 382,
and 383, often with an emphasis on the analysis of various phases
of the decay. Fig. 28 shows primary-particle-size distributions mea-
sured using TEM images from samples collected at different HAB
in an atmospheric ethylene-air laminar-diffusion flame. LII-signal-
decay curves at these locations were fit assuming a monodisperse
distribution of primary-particles sizes (green vertical lines). The data

were also sequentially fit at times >300 ns to estimate the contri-
bution from large primary particles and at times <300 ns to estimate
the contribution from small primary particles [378]. At high pres-
sure, the situation becomes more complicated because significant
conductive heat-loss occurs during the laser pulse. Therefore, small
particles in the ensemble reach lower peak temperatures com-
pared to large ones, causing a systematic error in the experimental
determination of temperature and thus in the data analysis that
assumes initially homogeneous temperatures. An approach to es-
timate the distributions of primary-particle diameter based on the
decay of the effective temperature identified that the initial
temperature-decay rate of a soot particle ensemble at the moment
of the peak-soot-particle temperature is inversely proportional to
the Sauter mean diameter d32 of the poly-disperse primary-soot par-
ticles. The distribution width is then determined from the decay at
late times [215]. A survey and comparison of various methods for
the determination of particle-size distributions has been given by
Daun et al. [384].

Particle cooling is even more complicated in aggregates because
the individual particles are shielded by their neighbors, which makes
the cooling rate dependent on the number of primary particles
per aggregate and aggregate morphology (see Section 3.3), and the
effects of the primary-particle-size distribution may in practice be
masked by the aggregate effects. In cases where particle morphol-
ogy may vary, LII may need to be combined with ELS to determine
effective aggregate surface areas as input to the LII-decay
analysis, see Section 4.2.3. The analysis is complicated by the fact
that typically aggregate-size distributions in flames are rather broad
[385].

Measuring primary-particle sizes at elevated pressures and low
temperatures can be particularly challenging because the en-
hanced conductive-cooling rate strongly influences the particle-
energy balance during the laser pulse [177,221,386,387]. Because
of the strong desire to understand soot formation under high-
pressure conditions, considerable work has been devoted to
developing pulsed-LII primary-particle sizing for these conditions
[221,223,224,386–388].

The competition between the conductive-cooling rate and
absorptive-heating rate may be the major limiting factor in the
detection sensitivity of small particles, even at atmospheric pres-
sure and elevated temperature. A number of studies have
demonstrated the use of pulsed LII to measure particles that are
just a few nanometers in size at atmospheric and lower pressures
and at slightly elevated pressures [95,157,170,249,286,287]. Most
of these measurements were made at elevated temperatures as
well. Several of these studies have made use of pulsed LII to study
soot
formation and growth in flames and shock tubes
[95,170,249,286,287], taking advantage of the ability to make in
situ measurements without perturbing the combustion system by
sampling. The only restrictions on the use of pulsed LII for studies
of soot formation are that (1) the particles must be refractory and
(2) the particles must absorb the laser light. Results of Minutolo,
D’Alessio, and co-workers [34,389–391] suggest that incipient hy-
drocarbon particles are transparent to UV and visible light.
Absorption cross sections are even smaller at longer wavelengths,
e.g. Ref. 261. Semi-volatile hydrocarbon particles are unlikely to
be able to withstand temperatures 1000–2000 K above flame tem-
peratures required for LII detection [392]. Grotheer et al. [92] have
demonstrated that hydrocarbon-based incipient soot particles va-
porize or dissociate during laser heating. The results of Stirn et al.
[95] similarly suggest a sensitivity to soot particles >3 nm but neg-
ligible sensitivity to hydrocarbon-based incipient particles in this
size range. The balance between conductive cooling and absorp-
tive heating is likely to have a much more significant impact on
the detectible size limit for CW LII and for pulsed LII at high pres-
sures and/or low temperatures.

For point measurements the entire pulsed-LII-signal-decay curve
can be measured with fast PMTs in combination with a transient
recorder, such as a digital storage oscilloscope. The temporal res-
olution must be sufficient to capture the decay, which is on the order
of a few hundred nanoseconds for soot in atmospheric-pressure
flames, but is shorter at higher pressures or lower ambient gas tem-
peratures. At low fluence, for which decay rates are relatively slow,
time-resolved measurements can be made as coarsely as in 10-ns
intervals, although steps of 1 ns or less are often used.

Typical “fast” PMTs have rise times of 1–1.5 ns and cannot closely
follow the rapid signal increase during the heating of soot. There-
fore, the signal evaluation is often restricted to the signal decay after
the signal peak. In this case, for an accurate evaluation of the pulsed-
LII decay curves, the peak-particle temperature Tmax, which occurs
during or at the end of the laser pulse, must be provided as an input
parameter for the LII-signal model. Calculating this temperature,
based on the absorption cross section of the soot particle, the laser
fluence and the photo-induced processes during laser heating, is
associated with large uncertainties. Therefore, the time-dependent
temperature [107] or the peak-particle temperature [181,393] is often
measured via two-color pyrometry [107,181,393]. The pulsed-LII
signal is detected at two wavelengths or wavelength ranges λ1 and
λ2. Assuming a top-hat beam profile and identical temperatures
for all particles in the ensemble, the signal ratio at these two
wavelengths is related to the particle temperature [106,394] ac-

Here, h is the Planck constant, c is the speed of light, kB is the
Boltzmann constant, Sp is the detected emission signal from the par-
ticles at the two detection wavelengths, and K1 and K2 are calibration
constants that account for the spectral sensitivity of the detectors
at the two wavelengths. The emissivity, ε, given in Eq. (7), is a func-
tion of the refractive index of soot. The absolute value of E(m) is
not required here; only the ratio of E(m) at the two detection wave-
lengths is needed. The ratio ε(λ2)/ε(λ1) can be approximated by λ1/
λ2 assuming that E(m) is constant between the two wavelengths.
The validity of this approximation can introduce some uncertain-
ty to the inferred temperatures [119,395]. A careful choice of the
detection wavelengths is necessary. A theoretical study by Liu et al.
[124] compares the different strategies and suggests the 400/
780 nm combination based on the respective temperature effects
for low to moderate fluences. They especially stress the advantage
of using a short-wavelength option for the blue channel. This study,
however, did not consider the effect of spectral interferences at higher
fluences that could influence the choice of the detection wave-
length in a particular experiment. The reasons for the experimentally
chosen wavelength combinations therefore mainly are to avoid in-
terferences from C2 Swan-band emission (see Sections 4.1.1 and 4.2.1)
and to choose a spectral range where the detection system is most
sensitive. For (the commonly used) detection at 450 and 550 nm,
C2 interference can be relevant for wide bandpass filters. There is
no universal best solution. Depending on the measurement situa-
tion, the potential contribution of interfering species, and the
efficiency of the detection scheme (such as collection solid angle
and the angle between the laser propagation direction and the de-
tection axis), a compromise must be made between temperature
sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio. To increase signal collection at
long wavelengths, it may also be advisable to use a longpass filter
instead of a bandpass filter [396].

TiRe-LII measurements [381,384] with PMTs are limited to
pointwise detection. The spatial distribution of particle sizes can
be revealed only with repeating the measurements at different lo-
cations; this approach is not possible for rapidly fluctuating situations

30

like those in unsteady flames. Will et al. [36,158,167] developed a
strategy for two-dimensional particle sizing, where pulsed-LII signals
are acquired at two delay times after the laser pulse with gated in-
tensified cameras and where the particle size is deduced from the
local signal ratio with the obvious restriction that only average par-
ticle sizes can be obtained. This technique provided particle-size
distributions with high spatial resolution for laminar flames at at-
mospheric pressure. For elevated pressure, Cenker et al. [386]
presented a theoretical study of the best choice of detection pa-
rameters for two-time-step detection. Streak cameras allow TiRe-
LII measurements along a line [397], and the technique has been
recently extended to multi-time-step detection with a multi-chip
camera, which improves the possibilities of reconstructing the LII-
signal decay, as has been demonstrated in single-shot imaging
measurements by Sun et al. [398] in turbulent flames.

4.2.3. Aggregate size

Although there may be a significant influence of aggregate size
and structure on time-resolved pulsed-LII results (see Section 3.3),
depending on the heat-conduction regime, the primary-particle size
is the main size parameter to be determined from pulsed LII. TiRe-
LII can be a unique and powerful technique in this context.
Nonetheless, measuring aggregate size is equally important for de-
veloping a full understanding of particle formation; knowledge of
aggregate size and morphology is also vital for an improved mea-
surement of primary-particle size via LII. The aggregate-size
distributions are typically assumed to be log-normal, although it
has been suggested that a double log-normal may be a better de-
scriptor for soot aggregates [72].

Besides various approaches for a direct determination of aggre-
gate sizes and morphologies from light scattering alone [15], there
are a few combinations of LII and light scattering that allow for a
measurement of aggregate size. With the possibility of measuring
volume fractions by LII, the combination of LII and light scattering
may provide the diameter of a volume-equivalent sphere, similar-
ly to scattering/extinction measurements. Quay et al. [24] used this
approach for pointwise measurements of soot-particle diameters
in a diffusion flame and obtained good agreement with previous
results from scattering and extinction. Will et al. [36,158] per-
formed two-dimensional measurements on a diffusion flame and
could obtain a complete qualitative picture of aggregate sizes in such
a flame; no calibration of scattering was performed to provide quan-
titative analysis. Though addressing the determination of aggregate
sizes, these initial experiments, however, did not account for an ex-
plicit structure factor for light scattering. Later Reimann et al. [399]
took up these early approaches and performed a quantitative 2D
determination of aggregate sizes in the form of radii of gyration Rg
in a premixed flame (see Fig. 31). They pointed out that these mea-
surements are limited to a maximum of qRg ≈ 1, with q the modulus
of the scattering vector, as a general restriction from the depen-
dence of the structure factor on aggregate size. For larger values of
qRg, the sensitivity of the structure factor on particle size is dras-
tically reduced. With their conventional perpendicular arrangement
of laser sheet and direction of observation, the maximum average
size accessible was limited to about 60 nm. Ma and Long [400] re-
cently extended this approach and combined two-dimensional multi-
angle light scattering with multi-wavelength line-of-sight attenuation
and previous TiRe-LII measurements to obtain a comprehensive char-
acterization of particle parameters and soot optical properties in a
co-flow laminar non-premixed flame. Snelling et al. [29] used a
compact set-up combining pointwise LII and light scattering at an
angle of 35°. This approach provided sensitivity to particle sizes of
about 200 nm. They compared radii of gyration from this combi-
nation with those obtained from two-angle light scattering with good
agreement for a given form of the particle distribution. Crosland et al.
[401] extended these studies using LII and two-angle ELS to infer

soot-volume fraction, primary-particle diameter, and aggregate radius
of gyration simultaneously. Compared to pure light scattering, in-
tegrating LII into these measurements on aggregate sizes has the
obvious advantage that other relevant quantities, such as concen-
tration, primary-particle size, and fractal dimension, become
accessible. Aggregate sizing from light scattering alone, however,
does not rely on the refractive index. A simultaneous application
of both approaches thus allows for a consistency check regarding
m.

Where applications allow for extractive sampling from combus-
tion systems or the ambient atmosphere, CW LII provides the
capability for measuring aggregate size on a particle-by-particle basis.
Measurements using the SP2 allow resolution of mass distribu-
tions over mass ranges of ~0.5–300 fg [126,130]. This mass range
is equivalent to aggregates with Np ≈ 8–5000 primary particles with
diameter dp = 40 nm. For a typical fractal dimension Df of 1.75, this
equivalent aggregate would have a mobility diameter of ~110–
2000 nm, based on the relationship [55,402].

Although this technique lacks sensitivity to particles on the high
and low end of the size spectrum, it has the advantage that it allows
measurements of individual particles, which is very attractive for
studies of inhomogeneous or broad particle distributions. Volume
fractions or mass distributions are derived from histograms of signals
from individual particles. Fig. 29 shows a comparison of the mass
distribution of soot sampled from a co-flow diffusion flame mea-
sured by the SP2 and by a centrifugal particle mass analyzer (CPMA)
[130]. The corresponding mobility size distribution, measured with
an SMPS, is also shown. Particles were size selected for a mobility
diameter of 125 nm and had a fractal dimension of ~1.9. Fig. 29 dem-
onstrates excellent agreement between the CPMA and SP2 mass
distributions at particle masses between 0.52 and 10 fg and some
discrepancies at masses lower than 0.52 fg and mobility diam-
eters smaller than 140 nm.

selected soot particles. Soot was extracted from a co-flow diffusion flame and size

4.2.4. Particle composition and mixing state

Because LII has some sensitivity to soot maturity (see Sections
3.2.1 and 3.2.2) and volatile coatings (see Section 3.4), LII signal be-
havior can potentially provide compositional information. This area
of development is much less mature than other applications, such
as primary-particle sizing or volume-fraction and mass-distribution
measurements. Mixing state refers to how components of an aerosol
distribution with an inhomogeneous composition are combined. In
an external mixture of particles, soot particles mingle with other
materials as separate and distinct particles. In an internal mixture,
soot particles are mixed with other materials within individual par-
ticles. With respect to internal mixtures, small soot particles could
be well mixed with other materials within each particle; they can
exist in a core-shell configuration with soot sitting in the center of
the particle surrounded by a coating; or they can be segregated from
the other material, perhaps attached to the surface of a particle of
another material. The mixing state of soot has a strong influence
on its optical properties and is of great interest for climate studies,
e.g. Refs. 2, 296, 403, and 404.

Early in the development of pulsed LII for applications to engine
exhaust, Case and Hofeldt [336] noted that the volatile coatings found
on most engine-exhaust soot particles could perturb pulsed-LII
signals, particularly at lower laser fluences and in the wings of Gauss-
ian laser beams at all fluences (see Section 3.4). They combined LII
with elastic-light scattering (ELS) measurements and demon-
strated differences in the relative response of these techniques with
engine load. They suggested that the combination of LII and ELS could
be used to determine the volatile fraction of particle mass by mea-
suring the delay in the onset of LII caused by vaporization of the
volatile coating.

Witze et al. [197,198] developed an extension of pulsed LII called
laser-induced desorption with elastic-laser scattering (LIDELS) to
measure soot-volume fraction and volatile-coating fraction of exhaust
particles in real time. This technique combines LII and ELS using
two laser pulses of comparable energy separated in time. The first
laser pulse provides an ELS signal for inferring the total particle-
volume fraction. This pulse is also absorbed by the soot core particles,
causing the particles to heat sufficiently to desorb the volatile coating.
The ELS signal from the second pulse is used to infer the volume
fraction of the non-volatile core particles. LII is recorded simulta-
neously with the ELS signals for complementary measurements of
volume fraction of the non-volatile core particles.

Using pulsed LII, López-Yglesias et al. [219] propose exploiting
the shift in fluence curves to higher fluences for less mature soot
(e.g., Fig. 15) as a proxy for soot maturity. Similarly, it might be pos-
sible to determine the presence of volatile coatings from the shift
to higher fluences of the fluence curves caused by such coatings (e.g.,
Fig. 22). Coupling pulsed LII with ELS for these applications might
allow the effects of soot maturity to be isolated from the similar
effects of volatile coatings on fluence curves. In any case, much more
work needs to be done to determine whether such an approach will
be viable.

CW LII can also provide information about volatile coatings. As
shown in Fig. 21, temporal LII profiles recorded by the SP2 are
delayed in time when significant amounts of volatile coating are
present on the particles, and some studies using the SP2 instru-
ment have been focused on extracting this information [128,129].
Detection of scattered laser light as the particle traverses the intra-
cavity beam provides additional information about the particle as
it heats. If the particle has a significant volatile coating, some of the
energy absorbed by the particle will be lost to vaporizing the coating,
and the particle will take longer to reach detectable incandes-
cence temperatures. The LII signal will be delayed in time, but the
scattered signal will not be susceptible to such a delay. The differ-
ence in time between the LII and scattering signals can be used to
determine whether or not the particle has a thick coating

Fig. 30. CW-LII and scattering temporal profiles from a particle demonstrating neg-
ative lag time. Broadband (magenta line) and narrowband (cyan line) LII-temporal
profiles are shown with signal from the scattering channel (black line). The dotted
yellow line represents the laser–particle interaction time. Adapted from Sedlacek
et al. [407]. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the

[97,128,129]. This technique is promising but has not yet been shown
to be quantitative. In addition, because of conductive-cooling effects,
small aggregate sizes and open aggregate morphologies (e.g., fractal
dimensions of ~1.8) can lead to LII-signal delays for uncoated par-
ticles similar to those observed for coated particles; these effects
can mimic the effects of volatile coatings and complicate the anal-
ysis [130]. Schwarz et al. [405,406] identified coated particles by a
reduction in the scattering signal prior to the peak in the LII signal,
suggesting that, as the particle heats, the volatile coating is vapor-
ized, and scattering decreases.

Recent results have suggested that CW LII can be employed to
derive additional information about particle-mixing state. As noted
above, LII signals of soot particles coated with a semi-volatile or vol-
atile coating will be delayed in time as the coating is vaporized from
the laser-heated particle. This time delay is called the “lag time”
[407,408]. Sedlacek et al. [407] observed that, under some condi-
tions, LII signals can appear early relative to the laser-scatter signal,
as shown in Fig. 30, i.e., they demonstrate negative lag times. Sedlacek
et al. [407] hypothesized that negative lag times may be attribut-
able to soot particles sitting on the outside of larger particles; they
can heat and vaporize early during the laser–particle interaction time
without conducting too much heat to the other material within the
particle. Generally, the scattering signal is detected much earlier than
the LII signal for particles with mixed composition, as shown in
Fig. 21. Fig. 30 shows an example of a particle for which the LII signal
appeared well before the peak of the scattering signal. Although neg-
ative lag times have been observed by other groups, e.g. Ref. 408,
they are not common, and further work is needed to firmly iden-
tify the cause of negative lag times.

5. Applications

5.1. Flames

Pulsed LII has been applied to a broad variety of flames. Atmo-
spheric laminar flames have played the most prominent role in the
development of the technique, and two types of flames are of par-
ticular importance. Jet-diffusion flames have been used extensively
to demonstrate the favorable characteristics of pulsed LII for the two-
dimensional visualization of the sooting properties of flames.
Premixed burners, mostly of a McKenna type, have also been em-
ployed for the development of various implementations of LII as
these flames show an essentially one-dimensional character, i.e., to
a first approximation, properties of the flame only change with height
above the burner. An intercomparison of data derived by LII from
several groups for three different burners (McKenna burner with a

laminar co-flow burners) is documented by Schulz et al. [113].

[416,417] and the concurrent theoretical and experimental descrip-
tion of soot distributions in non-premixed flames [418–420].

For laminar diffusion flames, a number of early papers investi-
gated the visualization and quantitative measurement of soot
concentration in an imaging fashion [117,150,160,409]. Employ-
ing pointwise measurements, Quay et al. [24] addressed the
combination of LII and light scattering for the determination of
volume-equivalent diameters of soot aggregates. Soon thereafter,
Will et al. [36,158] succeeded in a two-dimensional measurement
of primary-particle sizes in an ethylene diffusion flame. Using LII
combined with light scattering, they were able to describe the char-
acteristic features of the formation, aggregation, and oxidation of
soot particles. Many other investigations employing laminar diffu-
sion flames followed; recent examples include a study on the
relationship between the prompt LII signal and volume fraction [410],
the application of two-color LII in an imaging fashion [395], and the
combination of LII with light scattering [29] and extinction [118].
Diffusion flames have often been the object of investigation under
the especially challenging conditions of microgravity, e.g.
[165,371,411], with LII allowing for an efficient assessment of the
differences of soot formation in buoyant and non-buoyant flames.
Likewise there is a long history of pulsed-LII usage in laminar
premixed flames with a number of early studies addressing fun-
damental issues of LII, e.g. Refs. 35, 152, and 160. Some recent
examples include studies focusing on the combination of pulsed LII
and light scattering [29,214,399] (see Fig. 31), a basic assessment
of the method, a study of the fluence effects using LII and ELS [285],
a comparison with other techniques [412], and a measurement of
optical properties of soot [249].

There have been a number of LII studies on these types of flames
at both low and high pressures. Investigations at pressures as low
as 12 kPa, e.g. Refs. 181, 263, and 413, have focused on issues of cal-
ibration of LII for low volume fractions, the extension of the soot
formation zone for ease of observation, and the general features of
soot formation under these conditions. There are a larger number
(e.g. Refs. 222, 414, and 415) of LII experiments at elevated pres-
sures up to 4 MPa with a focus both on LII modeling under these
conditions and on the influence of pressure on the sooting charac-
teristics of the flames investigated.

Generally, pulsed LII has been widely applied for the fundamen-
tal investigation of soot formation in flames and the development
and testing of numerical models. Desgroux et al. [348] recently pre-
sented an excellent review on the use of LII and other optical
methods in this context, and we refer the interested reader to this
paper. Applications include the characterization of the soot pro-
pensity of various fuels as derived from the soot-volume fraction
measured by LII and frequently used, e.g., by McEnally and Pfefferle

Given the ability of pulsed LII to provide instantaneous two-
dimensional characterization of the soot distribution, particular
interest is directed at measurements in turbulent flames. Simple jet-
diffusion flames are often used for these studies, which range from
visualization [148] and measurement of soot-volume fractions [117]
in the early years to the statistical analysis of soot parameters [421]
and combinations of pulsed LII with other optical techniques for a
simultaneous determination of temperature, species concentra-
tion, and flow fields [186,422–424]. Among the multitude of flames
investigated by LII, pool fires with diameters up to 2 m constitute
both particularly challenging and spectacular case studies [425,426].
Other recent applications of pulsed LII include investigations on the
soot-turbulence interaction in the soot-formation region of non-
premixed jet flames [427] and the development of surrogates for
real fuels [428] and of pulverized coal flames [429].

Pulsed LII is also well suited for studies in turbulent flames
because of the ability to perform single-shot imaging under many
conditions. Pulsed LII can also be coupled with other imaging tech-
niques, such as planar LIF (PLIF) detection of selected gas-phase
species. Fig. 32 shows an example of UV LIF detection of PAHs
coupled with pulsed LII.

5.2. Internal combustion engines

Reducing soot formation is an important goal for the develop-
ment of modern internal-combustion engines. Soot originates from
diffusion controlled (Diesel-like) combustion and pool fires. While
traditionally the focus was on Diesel engines only, soot emissions
from direct-injection gasoline engines recently became an impor-
tant topic in the light of new emissions legislation. Because the soot
emitted from engines depends in a complicated way on the in-
cylinder conditions, exhaust-gas sampling measurements do not
provide the information that is required for understanding the for-
mation process in sufficient detail. The soot that is emitted from
engines depends on two consecutive processes, soot formation (and
its spatial inhomogeneities) and soot oxidation. Soot oxidation can
fail because of local quenching of the diffusion flame that sur-
rounds (and, in the best case, burns) the soot or because of overall
low temperatures in the expansion stroke that cause reactions to
become too slow for full soot oxidation within the time available.
While soot formation has been visualized successfully based on the
light emission during the hot combustion phase, e.g., in Diesel sprays,
the soot oxidation phase tends to be invisible for this technique
because gas-phase (and hence particle) temperatures are too low
to generate sufficiently strong thermal radiation [431]. Therefore,

there is a strong interest in using LII for quantitative and qualita-
tive in-cylinder measurements. With respect to the field of
combustion in Diesel engines, great interest has been devoted to
the investigation of droplet and spray combustion. Papers in this
field include studies on single, fiber-supported [164] or freely falling
[117] droplets and soot formation from Diesel sprays in high-
pressure chambers or rapid-compression machines [65,224,432,433].
The applications of LII to exhaust measurements are treated inde-
pendently in Section 5.3. Applications range from qualitative imaging
that is used for developing conceptual models of soot formation and
oxidation, quantitative imaging of soot-volume fractions, point mea-
surements of particle size with the purpose of generating data for
model validation, and fast measurements in the exhaust gas that
outperform conventional soot-measurement techniques in terms
of real-time capability and dynamic range. Quantifying LII from
engine measurements is especially challenging because of the strong
variations in ambient pressure and temperature depending on the
timing of the measurement in an engine cycle.

Motivated by engine measurements and the goal of perform-
ing them under more “idealized” conditions, measurements have
been carried out in shock tubes [166,170], rapid compression ma-
chines [433], and Diesel sprays injected into high-pressure chambers
[224,432]. Often these experiments simplify quantitative studies that
are aimed at the development of models. These model experi-
ments allow decoupling of the chemistry from mixture formation
and turbulence and provide clean environments in which sprays are
not influenced by wall effects, and windows remain clean for ex-
tended periods of time. From a diagnostics point of view, these
experiments have the advantage of better control of measure-
ment conditions, better optical access, and, because of the
comparably high level of reproducibility (in contrast to typical engine
cycles), improved options to correct for influences such as laser and
signal attenuation.

Because of the large number of applications reported in the lit-
erature, it is not possible to fully cover all work. We will therefore
present typical examples and pioneering work.

5.2.1. Qualitative imaging of soot-volume fraction

Early measurements demonstrated the applicability of LII to in-
cylinder measurements in an optically accessible square-piston
engine in combination with NO-LIF imaging [434]. Pioneering work
about the temporal and spatial distribution of in-cylinder soot for-
mation and oxidation was carried out by Dec and coworkers
[141,144,435], which led to the formulation of a conceptual model
of DI Diesel combustion [145]. Conceptual models for “classical”

Diesel processes were expanded to cases with high air entrain-
ment and exhaust-gas recirculation, where virtually no engine-
out soot can be detected, and where the LII measurement showed
that soot was only observed in the recirculation zones close to the
bowl perimeter [436].

The simultaneous measurement of the distribution of OH LIF and
soot (via LII) provided information about soot oxidation by the dif-
fusion flame, and its failure once the flame is quenched at the wall
[437]. Fig. 33 shows an example of OH and LII distributions in an
engine cylinder; this example demonstrates that qualitative imaging
measurements can be powerful for obtaining a conceptual under-
standing of processes.

While the measurements in Fig. 33 were made in individual
engine cycles, the effect of exhaust-gas recirculation (EGR) in a heavy-
duty engine was investigated with a sequence of LII measurements.
For these measurements a laser cluster was used to generate a se-
quence of eight laser pulses for mapping the soot distribution with
an 8-chip framing camera with a time resolution of 1° crank angle
[438]. Because of the high repetition rate of laser pulses required,
however, the measurements are perturbed by the measurement tech-
nology [439].

5.2.2. Quantitative imaging of soot-volume fraction

To obtain absolute soot-volume fractions from pulsed LII, signal
intensities must be calibrated. Therefore, the accuracy of the mea-
surement is strongly influenced by the accuracy of the calibration
method. For calibration of pulsed LII measurements, in principle,
two approaches are feasible. The semi-quantitative measurement,
where the signal is proportional to the soot-volume fraction, can
be compared to a calibration measurement using pulsed LII, e.g., in
a standard flame. Alternatively, the measurement under the con-
ditions of interest is compared to an independent evaluation of the
soot-volume fraction using a different technique, e.g., laser extinc-
tion. In the first case, a calibration burner (that has been
characterized before) must be placed in the detection volume
without changing the optical setup. A more critical limitation,
however, is that calibrating measurements in a high-pressure en-
vironment with an atmospheric-pressure flame, such as in Refs. 142,
353, and 440, can be problematic, not only because the pressure-
dependent heat-conduction must be considered [223], but also
because optical properties of the soot can be different.

Some of these uncertainties can be reduced by using light ex-
tinction as the calibration method. However, this technique depends
on the knowledge of the refractive index of soot, which can differ
significantly between different experiments [441]. For calibration

34

influence of bulk-flow structures on soot formation has been in-
vestigated by combined pulsed LII and PIV (particle-image
velocimetry) measurements in a swirl-supported, direct-injection
Diesel engine [449,450]. Combinations of pulsed LII and Rayleigh
scattering were used to determine relative soot diameters from in-
cylinder [451] and high-pressure spray-chamber measurements
[374].

Other applications include low-temperature Diesel combus-
tion [452] and, with increasing regulations of particle emissions from
spark-ignition engines, the interest in LII imaging has recently been
expanded to gasoline engines. Direct-injection gasoline engines and
engines with low-temperature combustion and high dilution with
exhaust gases are of particular interest [431]. In the work of de
Francqueville et al. [453] a combination of pulsed LII and laser ex-
tinction has been applied to gasoline direct-injection engines, where
the extinction signal was used to calibrate the LII soot-volume-
fraction measurements. Under these measurement conditions, peak-
soot-volume fractions are typically lower than in conventional Diesel
combustion. In contrast, the high soot-volume fraction in Diesel
sprays can severely attenuate laser and signal light through ab-
sorption and scattering and thus influence quantitative
measurements [454]. For improving the quantification of in-
cylinder soot-volume-fraction measurements, strategies for
correcting for signal trapping have been developed for optically thick
media [156,414,455–457].

5.2.3. In-cylinder diesel particle sizing

Several experiments have focused on the determination of soot
primary-particle sizes using time-resolved-pulsed-LII measure-
ments. In-cylinder soot particle-size measurements were carried out
in a single-cylinder Diesel engine. The pulsed-LII signal decay from
the poly-disperse soot-particle ensemble was evaluated based on
the assumption of either mono-disperse or lognormal [458] and log-
normal or multi-lognormal particle-size distribution. It was found
that the time dependence of the LII signal contains sufficient struc-
ture to allow retrieval of details of the particle-size distribution and
that a multi-lognormal size distribution approach yielded the best
results [381]. Based on this approach, the typical increase and de-
crease of soot-particle sizes in early and late phases of the
combustion process were observed [459]. However, with increas-
ing pressure, the relevant time domain becomes shorter and more
difficult to analyze. At high pressure, conductive cooling during par-
ticle heating causes additional complexity, which might cause a
particle-size dependence of the peak particle temperature at the
end of the laser pulse [387]. Theoretical analyses of the effects for
pressures up to 60 bar have been carried out by several groups
[177,221,386,387].

Fig. 34 shows the results of

in-cylinder particle-size
measurements in a two-stroke Diesel engine [172]. The

with extinction, however, the experiment requires optical access from
three sides, and beam steering can cause additional losses in trans-
mitted signal. In addition, the LII measurement must cover the full
interaction length where the laser light could potentially be at-
tenuated to connect the measured attenuation with the integrated
soot mass along the beam path.

Neither calibration strategy is ideal, but combining them can
further reduce the associated uncertainties of each. In small-bore
optical Diesel engines, additional problems arise from rapid window
fouling. Additionally, measurements late in the cycle can be com-
pared to exhaust-gas measurements of particulate concentration.
In all cases, in-cylinder measurements will have significantly larger
errors compared to measurements under stationary atmospheric-
pressure conditions.

In addition to the variation of injection pressures, ambient density,
and pressure [224,442,443], the effect of nozzle geometry [374], in-
cluding cluster nozzles [444], has been investigated with pulsed LII
in high-pressure combustion vessels, and quantitative data have been
used for the validation of soot-formation simulations [445]. Because,
in high-pressure cells, Diesel combustion can be decoupled from
flow-field effects, the influence of fuel composition on soot forma-
tion has been investigated with pulsed LII [446].

Combinations of pulsed LII measurements with simultane-
ously performed laser diagnostics have been reported to investigate
the interaction of fuel concentration and flows and to gain addi-
tional information about the soot field. The correlation of soot-
volume fraction and mixture formation has been investigated with
combined measurements of soot by pulsed LII and fuel concentra-
tion via laser-induced exciplex fluorescence imaging [447,448]. The

time-resolved-pulsed-LII signal was detected at 550 and 694 nm after
excitation at 1064 nm with a laser fluence of 0.10 J/cm2. The count-
median diameter (CMD) is in the range of 30–75 nm and increases
up to a crank angle (CA) of about 10° CA and decreases again toward
a value of about 30 nm at 100° CA after top dead center (TDC). This
behavior can be explained by particle formation and subsequent par-
ticle oxidation. The geometric standard deviation of the size
distribution, σg, is constant at a value of 1.1 up to a crank angle of
70° CA and then increases toward about 1.32. The in-cylinder mea-
surements with LII were compared with TEM measurements from
samples collected with a thermophoretic sampler in the engine
exhaust. Good agreement was demonstrated between the pulsed-
LII-inferred sizes at 100° CA after TDC and the TEM determined
primary-particle sizes in the exhaust gas.

An application to measurements in a heavy-duty Diesel engine
was reported by Bougie et al. [459]. Boiarciuc et al. [460] have used
two-color time-resolved LII measurements in a Diesel engine for
the determination of soot-volume fraction and primary-particle di-
ameters. In addition, particle-size measurements are finding their
application in gasoline direct-injection engines, indicating the in-
creased interest in understanding and avoiding soot emissions from
this type of engine [461].

5.3. Exhaust gases

Pulsed LII has also been shown to be very useful for measure-
ments of soot in engine exhaust. Case and Hofeldt [146,336]
demonstrated the advantages of pulsed LII for measuring soot in
Diesel exhaust with high sensitivity for engine particulates, high time
resolution relative to the exhaust stroke and associated transient
conditions, and relative insensitivity to variable operating condi-
tions. Snelling and coworkers [105,106,108,147] and Witze and
coworkers [105,409,462,463] further developed the technique for
Diesel and spark-ignition engine exhaust, and Schraml et al.
[464–466] extended its applicability to Diesel-exhaust-particle sizing
using time-resolved pulsed LII. Jenkins et al. [467] and Black and
coworkers [38,468–470] similarly demonstrated the applicability
of LII for aircraft-engine exhaust-particle measurements.

Engine-exhaust particulates are often coated with significant vol-
atile coatings. As described in Section 4.2.4, Case and Hofeldt [336]
combined pulsed LII with elastic-light scattering (ELS) measure-
ments to study emissions as a function of engine load and noticed
differences in the response of LII and ELS, which they attributed to
volatile coatings. Witze et al. [197,198] later combined pulsed LII
with ELS in a technique called laser-induced desorption with elastic
laser scattering (LIDELS) for real-time measurements of soot volume
fraction and volatile-coating fraction of exhaust particles (see Section
4.2.4).

Commercial instruments, namely the LI2SA (Esytec) and the LII
200 and the LII 300 (Artium Technologies), have been evaluated
against numerous other nanoparticle measurement instruments for
the measurement of mass concentration in vehicle emissions
[115,471,472]. In the study by Durbin et al. [471], pulsed LII was
evaluated for potential application as an on-board emission-
measurement system for emissions from heavy-duty Diesel trucks.
Work on gas-turbine-exhaust emission measurement has led to an
international-standard method that uses LII for the measurement
of nonvolatile-particulate matter (nvPM) [473]. This standard pro-
cedure includes calibration of mass concentration by correlation with
elemental carbon (EC) determined by thermo-optical analysis as pre-
scribed in NIOSH 5040 [284]. Research to support this standard has
shown, using extractive sampling from the exhaust to transfer par-
ticles to the instrument, that pulsed LII is effective in measuring nvPM
(solid combustion-generated nanoparticles) from commercial air-
craft engines [474,475].

CW LII has also been used for studies of exhaust gases from on-
road vehicles (e.g. Refs. 200 and 476) and ships (e.g. Ref. 477). These
measurements tend to be made in the ambient atmosphere. Al-
though they have some limitations on detection of particles in the
size range typical of Diesel and gasoline engine emissions (see
Section 5.4), they provide measurements with fast (1-s) time re-
sponse and high sensitivity to a significant fraction of Diesel-
engine particulate emissions and can provide highly valuable
measurements, particularly when combined with complementary
techniques.

5.4. Ambient atmosphere

Some early applications of pulsed LII focused on characteriza-
tion of ambient particulates. Filippov et al. [157] subjected lab air
to laser pulses and found that the size distribution obtained from
the time-resolved signals was shifted to smaller values with in-
creasing pulse energy, a fact they attributed to the possible
disintegration of clusters. More recently, there have been a
number of measurements of atmospheric black carbon by LII
[125,128,199,200,478–482]. Lu and coworkers [199,200] devel-
oped a high sensitivity variant of the pulsed-LII approach pioneered
by Snelling and co-workers for use in combustion studies [107]. The
soot-volume fraction detection limit for the instrument devel-
oped by Smallwood and co-workers [107,199,200], known as the
high-sensitivity LII (HS-LII) instrument, is 8 × 10–15, which is equiv-
alent to 15 fg/cm3 for a distribution of particles [199], and Migliorini
et al. [482] recently developed a pulsed-LII instrument with a de-
tection limit of 200 fg/cm3. The lower limit on particle size is
currently unknown, but several groups have pushed the size limit
for pulsed LII to particle sizes of a few nanometers in diameter at
elevated detection volume temperatures and pressures near atmo-
spheric and lower [95,157,170,249,287,370].

Fig. 35 shows a comparison of transportation-emission mea-
surements from the SP2 and HS-LII instruments [200]. Because the
SP2 instrument may be insensitive to a significant fraction of par-
ticles in the size range emitted by some transportation sources, its
measurements tend to be lower than those of the HS-LII instru-
ment (by as much as 80%) under conditions in which the main
sources of black-carbon particulates are predominantly light-duty
gasoline vehicles [200,476]. Agreement between the instruments
is better (to within 40%) for conditions when the traffic contains a
larger fraction of heavy-duty Diesel vehicles, and a greater propor-
tion of the particles are within the measurement size range of the
SP2. The contrast in the measurements aided in assessing the rel-
ative contributions of gasoline and Diesel vehicles to the detected
emissions. These results are consistent with a studies by Holder and
coworkers [476,483].

How well the SP2 captures these smaller particles depends on
factors that include the alignment of the instrument and laser power
[377,484]. Fig. 36 shows a comparison of SP2 instruments demon-
strating the fall-off in sensitivity of the instruments for small-
particle sizes. When the instruments are well aligned, and the laser
power is high, the fall-off starts to occur at ~0.5 fg, which is con-
sistent with the results shown in Fig. 29. When the instrument is
poorly aligned or the laser power is low (dashed lines), the instru-
ment loses sensitivity to relatively large particles of <2 fg, which
corresponds to a mobility diameter of ~250 nm for a particle with
a fractal dimension of ~1.8 (see Fig. 29).

Recent work has exploited the sensitivity of the SP2 instru-
ment to coatings on atmospheric particles discussed in Section
3.4 [128,129]. Attempts have been made to correlate the amount
of volatile coating with the difference in time between the LII and
scattering signals [97,128,129] or with changes in the scattering
signal as the particle heats [405,406]. The results are promising,

but more work is required to verify that this technique can be
quantitative. In addition, a study of mature soot extracted from a
flame demonstrated that lag times used to infer thick coatings are
similar to those observed for small aggregates relative to large
aggregates and for particles with a fractal dimension of 1.9 rela-
tive to those with a fractal dimension of 2.3–2.4 [130], indicating
that particle morphology and size effects can mimic the effects of
coatings.

5.5. Engineered nanoparticles

The vast majority of LII applications have focused on soot, despite
early investigations on the application of LII to non-carbonaceous
material [157,194]; even the very first LII report by Weeks and Duley
[134] included a signal from an aluminum aerosol. Soot and other
carbonaceous particles are especially suitable for LII application
because of their high sublimation temperature of ~4000 K and their

appreciable imaginary part of the refractive index. In combina-
tion, these two properties allow for high peak-particle temperatures,
resulting in a pronounced thermal emission in the visible spectral
range with convenient detection.

Because of an increasing interest in the synthesis of engi-
neered nanoparticles in the gas phase, a wide range of materials
may potentially become a subject for the application of LII. In this
context an in situ measurement of particle sizes is of particular in-
terest because it offers the possibility of process monitoring and,
eventually, process control. The first such use of pulsed LII was de-
scribed by Dankers et al. [485] and Sommer et al. [486], who applied
the technique in various industrial production and test reactors for
carbon-black manufacturing, as shown in Fig. 37. Because of the ex-
tremely high solid concentration in industrial reactors, as compared
to flames, a different detection concept had to be employed. They
used a collinear approach and a beam splitter to perform excita-
tion and detection through the same window mounted to a flange
in the reactor, which was continuously purged. In these investiga-
tions Dankers et al. [485] could demonstrate a high sensitivity
(<1 nm) of the particle sizes measured to fluctuations and changes
in the reactor settings. They also obtained excellent correlation of
the sizes measured in situ with adsorption measurements, which
allowed characterization of the specific-surface area of the final
product.

Besides these successful measurements on particles similar to
soot, only a few approaches are reported in the literature on other
carbonaceous material. Allouis et al. [190,487] investigated the for-
mation of larger, micron-sized particles in Diesel and heavy oil spray
flames, namely so-called cenospheres (hollow particles) and
pleospheres (filled particles). They developed appropriate models
for the LII signals from these particles and were able to discrimi-
nate between these particles and much smaller soot particles, which
were present at much higher concentrations. They could also obtain
reasonable estimates for the sizes of various particles but concede
that the accuracy of the sizes obtained is low, as one would antic-
ipate in view of the very large parameter set used. Vander Wal et al.
[195] performed an extensive study on the dependence of the
pulsed-LII signal from carbon nanotubes on excitation and detec-
tion parameters. Mitrani and Shneider [488] performed studies of
pulsed LII on multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) sus-
pended in air in order to develop a diagnostic for in situ sizing. They
observed that large MWCNTs cooled faster than smaller ones, which
is opposite the behavior of soot, and concluded that MWCNT sizing
will require a detailed heat-transfer model including nonstationary
heat conduction, sublimation, defect formation, annealing, and ox-
idation. LII or similar approaches are sometimes used in the
investigation of carbon-nanotube formation. For example, with the
use of CW lasers in this process for the ablation of carbonaceous

material from a solid target, the resulting thermal radiation in the
plume is analyzed for particle temperature [489,490]. Cau et al. [491]
reported on the measurement of soot-particle sizes via time-
resolved pulsed LII in such a process.

Metals comprise another class of nanoparticles targeted for LII
investigations. Studies performed so far cover a wide range of ma-
terials, including silver [157,492], copper [493], titanium [194],
molybdenum [194,494,495], tungsten [194], nickel [496], and iron,
e.g. Refs. 170, 194, 495, 497, and 498. In a relatively early study
Vander Wal et al. [194] addressed the general viability of pulsed
LII for selected metal materials and investigated the spectral sig-
natures of these metal particles under various excitation and
detection schemes. They highlighted the need for a careful inter-
pretation of the spectra obtained because of the overlap between
atomic and molecular emission on the one hand and incandes-
cence on the other hand. Vander Wal [68] also pointed out that laser-
induced microplasmas of particles may produce a pseudo-blackbody
emission, which might be misidentified as LII. Additional complexi-
ties for application of LII to metals results from lower vaporization
temperatures and melting points and variations of the heat capac-
ity with temperature, particularly for some metals, such as iron [497].
With metal particles a laser-induced change in particle morphol-
ogy is obvious, and laser irradiation may thus also be used to induce
partial sintering in metal-particle aggregates [492,496]. When ag-
gregates from noble metals are subjected to laser radiation, however,
one must be aware that plasmonic resonances may result in local
field enhancements with the consequence of strongly nonuniform
heating within an aggregate [492]. Applications of LII to metal-
nanoparticle sizing are growing, but significant persistent limitations
are caused with large uncertainty associated with values of the
thermal accommodation coefficient αT for most combinations of par-
ticle material and bath gas. Effective accommodation coefficients
are usually obtained by matching the time-resolved-pulsed-LII signals
to independently determined particle sizes [497,499], and molec-
ular dynamics (MD) simulations [500] might eventually provide a
priori knowledge for future applications. Nevertheless, this ap-
proach requires a critical assessment of uncertainties and
experimental-verification approaches.

For other classes of particles, material reports on successful LII
applications are scarce. Eom et al. [501] and Sipkens et al. [495] mea-
sured the size of silicon particles as a representative of elemental
semiconducting materials during the growth in low-pressure plasma
reactors. For oxidic and ceramic materials a number of issues exist
that obviously prevent a broader applicability; issues include adverse
optical properties, a lack of knowledge of important physical prop-
erties, including the thermal accommodation coefficient, and the
superposition of other emissions upon the LII signal. In an early in-
vestigation Filippov et al. [157] performed measurements on a TiN

aerosol produced from commercial particles dispersed through a
shock-tube set-up. Although a reasonable time-resolved-pulsed-
LII signal could be observed, the particle sizes retrieved with a major
mode near 100 nm were one order of magnitude larger than the
specified primary-particle sizes. The authors ascribe this finding to
the generation of very compact aggregates during the dispersion
process. No published reports exist on LII investigations on silica
(SiO2) particles, the oxidic nanoparticles with the highest produc-
tion rate, which is probably due to the negligible imaginary part of
the refractive index in the visible and near infrared. A few studies,
however, have been carried out for titania (TiO2), the second-most
industrially important oxidic particulate material. Sommer et al. [486]
measured time-resolved pulsed-LII signals from nanoparticles pro-
duced in a laser-vaporization process, but could not evaluate these
signals because of interference from signals of the original coarse
material. For titania particles formed in a flame-synthesis process,
Zizak and co-workers [502,503] obtained characteristic signal–
decay curves, which reasonably correlated with heights in the flame,
but a spectral analysis showed that the signal is dominated by
narrow-band emission rather than broad-band thermal radiation.
They preferred to call their method “laser-induced emission” rather
than laser-induced incandescence. Lehre et al. [397] succeeded in
a quantitative analysis of LII signals from manganese and iron oxide
particles produced in a laser-vaporization reactor. In this case
effective-accommodation coefficients, which were not stated ex-
plicitly, were obtained by a fit to particle sizes obtained from TEM.
In summary, LII is very suitable for monitoring carbon-black pro-
duction. When it comes to non-carbonaceous material, however,
serious complications can limit the applicability of the technique.
Despite more uncertain “optical” properties of other particles, future
applications may be expected. In this context, however, knowl-
edge of the thermal accommodation coefficient and low-temperature
phase changes represent significant difficulties for quantitative par-
ticle sizing by pulsed LII.

5.6. Suspensions

Although laser-induced incandescence is commonly linked to the
measurement of nanoparticles in the gas phase, there are a large
number of investigations that deal with the properties of nano-
sized particles in a condensed phase after intense laser irradiation.
As in the early work of McEwan and Madden [504], which inves-
tigates the change of the refractive index of a colloid after a
nanosecond laser pulse, many studies use ink or more defined dis-
persions of carbon blacks. Other early papers include those of
Mansour et al. [505] and Nashold and Walter [506], which re-
ceived hundreds of citations and deal with the application of these
suspensions as “optical limiters”. The idea here is to find a medium
so that the radiant flux transmitted increases linearly with increas-
ing irradiance for low values and approaches a limiting value for
high irradiance. Many of the studies in this context focus on the
mechanisms of optical limiting and heat transfer, including the for-
mation of a microplasma around the heated particles, the generation
of acoustic waves and the formation of bubbles from the liquid
evaporated [504–507]. The term “laser-induced incandescence” for
the investigation of these phenomena in the liquid phase was prob-
ably used for the first time by Zelensky in 1999 [508], who also
performed related studies with borate glass doped with carbon
particles [509].

In 2007, Sommer and Leipertz [510] carried out an investiga-
tion devoted to the pulsed-LII-signal decay times of carbon-black
dispersions. For the ten carbon blacks employed, they found a linear
correlation between the LII-decay time and the primary-particle size
from TEM. They also identified a plateau region where both the
maximum LII signal and the decay time did not depend on the laser
fluence. In these measurements, which were performed for one type

of carbon black, they also found lack of dependence of the decay
time on the dispersion liquid, which was limited to ethanol, iso-
propanol, and methoxy-nonafluorobutane; these dispersion liquids
exhibited distinctively different liquid thermal conductivities. As a
tentative explanation for this behavior the authors mentioned similar
heat conductivities in the gas phase. No model has been pro-
posed, however, that would allow for the determination of particle
size from LII in liquids. One must conclude that sufficiently com-
prehensive models for LII in liquids would certainly be even more
complex than those for gases. Moreover, well-established methods
exist for nanoparticle sizing in liquids such as Dynamic Light Scat-
tering, which might explain the limited interest in further exploiting
LII in this context.

There is a great deal of interest in measuring black carbon in
snow, ice, and rain. CW-LII measurements have been used to make
these measurements by aspirating a liquid sample of rainwater,
melted snow, or melted ice containing black carbon [511–513]. After
the nebulized particles are dried, they are measured by the SP2 as
an airborne sample. Much of the development in this technique is
currently devoted to sample preservation and preparation and elim-
ination of coagulation effects [514–518].

6. Current research and future directions

LII has become the workhorse for soot-volume fraction and mass-
concentration determination in combustion and atmospheric
applications, and its utility continues to expand into new applica-
tion areas under a wider range of conditions. With additional work
coupling LII with other techniques, its usefulness may be further
extended into characterization of aggregate size, morphology, and
composition. Considerable progress has been made in recent years
on the development of a detailed understanding of LII. Neverthe-
less, uncertainties about the technique limit its reliability and
quantitative application under some conditions, and further re-
search will be required to narrow these uncertainties to advance
the technique.

Of general importance is the determination of reasonable de-
tection limits for volume-fraction measurements under a variety of
measurement conditions. Of particular current interest is the
minimum particle-size limit accessible by LII and the effects of par-
ticle composition and aerosol mixing state on LII signals. A related
point of interest is associated with the volatility limit for particle
detection, which defines the applicability of LII to incipient-soot for-
mation or brown-carbon detection. This topic is related to
understanding the efficiency with which LII can be used for mea-
surements of different forms of pure carbon, such as amorphous
carbon [110], which are likely to vaporize at much lower
temperatures.

Effects of particle composition include the application of LII to
materials other than carbon, which would allow application of LII
to a wide range of manufactured nanoparticles. Composition effects
also include inhomogeneous particles. As discussed in Section 3.4,
volatile coatings on carbonaceous-soot particles can strongly in-
fluence LII signals under some conditions, but the understanding
of these effects is far from complete. These effects could have sub-
stantial implications for several LII applications, particularly for those
associated with engines, exhaust streams, and the ambient atmo-
sphere, where coatings are prevalent.

There are a range of uncertainties associated with time-resolved
measurements and primary-particle sizing. One of the most im-
portant issues is the wide variability in results from different LII
models [205], which are used to analyze LII data to derive primary-
particle sizes, especially in the case of poly-disperse size distributions.
Current efforts are being directed at determining the critical energy-
and mass-balance mechanisms and how they should be imple-
mented in models and developing model-validation protocols.

Further work needs to focus on measuring the most important pa-
rameters included in these models, such as temperature-dependent
thermal accommodation coefficients of soot in various bath gases
and temperature-, wavelength-, and soot-maturity-dependent optical
properties of soot. As summarized in Section 3.3, one area of par-
ticularly active research focuses on the effects of aggregate size on
primary-particle sizing. More recent work highlights the addition-
ally important influence of aggregate morphology on pulsed-LII-
signal-decay rates and, hence, on inferred primary-particle sizes.
Because of the growing interest in engine applications, accurate mod-
eling of LII and experimental verification under high-pressure
conditions is critically important. Similarly, there is a need for re-
liable LII models for low-temperature conditions relevant to ambient
particles and exhaust streams.

Another area of active research is the application of CW LII to
ambient atmospheric particles and particles suspended in snow, ice,
and rainwater. For all of these applications, reliable instrument cal-
ibration is critical and is subject to considerable uncertainties. More
effort is needed to identify calibration standards with fine struc-
ture and characteristics similar to particles of interest. In addition,
assessing the reliability of studies of particle composition and mixing
state using CW LII is also an area of growing interest.

Optical (light extinction and scattering), probe-sampling, and
online molecular-beam techniques provide complementary infor-
mation about soot-particle sizes, morphology, composition, and
mixing state. The benefits that are connected to their combina-
tion with LII have not been fully explored. With the aim of fully
characterizing the properties of gas-borne particles, the field is open
for further development of useful combinations of techniques that
might be included in easy-to-use instruments, e.g., for atmospher-
ic and exhaust-gas analysis.

While LII is mostly understood as a method to investigate a per
se unknown particle ensemble based on a good physical under-
standing of the underlying physical processes and parameters, it
also has the potential to be seen in the opposite direction.
Once well-defined particle samples are available (well-characterized
in composition, morphology, and size distribution), pulsed
and CW LII provide ways to probe physical characteristics and
mechanisms.
