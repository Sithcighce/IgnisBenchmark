The combustion phenomenon is characterized by rapid self-sustaining reactions, which can occur in the
solid, liquid, or gas phase. Specific types of these reactions are used to produce valuable materials by differ-
ent combustion synthesis (CS) routes. In this article, all three CS approaches, i.e. solid-phase, solution, and
gas-phase flame, are reviewed to demonstrate their attractiveness for fabrication of zero-, one-, two-, and
three-dimensional nanostructures of a large variety of inorganic compounds. The review involves five sec-
tions. First, a brief classification of combustion synthesis methods is given along with the scope of the arti-
cle. Second, the state of art in the field of solid-phase combustion synthesis is described. Special attention is
paid to the relationships between combustion parameters and structure/properties of the produced nano-
materials. The third and fourth sections describe details for controlling material structures through solution
combustion synthesis and gas-phase flame synthesis, respectively. A variety of properties (e.g., thermal,
electronic, electrochemical, and catalytic) associated with different types of CS nanoscale materials are dis-
cussed. The conclusion focuses on the most promising directions for future research in the field of advanced
nanomaterial combustion synthesis.

1. Introduction

PCombustion is a complex phenomenon involving self-sustaining
chemical reactions accompanied by rapid heat release that typically
occurs in the form of a high temperature reaction front. Heat, light,
and work (engines) are the primary areas for application of combus-
tion processes. However, in some cases, the main purpose for these
reactions is the formation of condensed combustion products, i.e.
the synthesized materials. This synthesis method may be considered
as one of the most economical routes for preparation of advanced
materials, including zero-, one-, two-, and three- dimensional nano-
structures. Compared to other high-temperature techniques for fab-
rication of nanostructures, such as arc discharge [1], pulsed laser
synthesis [2], microwave heating [3], and chemical or physical vapor
deposition methods (CVD and PVP) [4,5], combustion does not
require any external heating sources, since the process uses heat
produced by exothermic reactions. Moreover, the short reaction
duration and rapid product cooling can result in the formation of
non-equilibrium products with unique electrochemical, physical,
biological, and mechanical properties [6].

PDepending on the physical state of the reactive media, three
types of combustion processes for the synthesis of nanostructured
materials can be distinguished: solid-phase combustion synthesis
(SP-CS), solution combustion synthesis (SCS), and gas-phase flame
synthesis (FS).

PIn SP-CS processes, a self-sustaining combustion wave propa-
gates in a solid mixture due to the heat released in the chemical
reaction. Solid-phase combustion was discovered by Prof. Merzha-
nov in 1967 and is also known as self-propagating high-temperature
synthesis (SHS) [7,8]. SP-CS has become a very popular approach for
preparation of various types of inorganic compounds, such as metals,
alloys, oxides, metal carbides, borides, silicides, etc. In principle, this
approach works for any solid-state exothermic mixture that is capa-
ble of maintaining a self-sustaining reaction and leads to the forma-
tion of valuable condensed products. Usually a short heat pulse is
locally applied to the surface of the solid reactants, which initiates
the combustion process. A thermal wave forms after ignition and

Ppropagates through the bulk sample, converting the precursor
powder mixture into the desired products.

PIn SCS, the initial reactive media is an aqueous solution of fuel
and oxidizer [9]. SCS involves many different physical, chemical, and
mechanical steps. However, all of these approaches include one
common step: initially solid precursors, i.e. fuel (e.g. glycine, urea,
citric acid) and oxidizer (e.g. metal nitrites) are dissolved in a liquid
solvent (e.g. water), making a reactive solution with reagents mixed
on the molecular level. Depending on the type of precursors, as well
as on the conditions used for the process organization, SCS may
occur either by volume or layer-by-layer propagating combustion
modes. Among the numerous papers published in recent years in
the SCS field, the synthesis of oxides dominate. Recently, pure metals
and alloys, along with metal sulfides and carbides, have also been
produced by this method.

PIn FS processes, the chemical reaction occurs between gaseous
components [10,11]. FS involves combustion of gaseous fuel such
as hydrocarbons and hydrogen in oxygen. In another procedure,
the precursor, which is gas or liquid droplets, is injected into the
burner and condensed particulates are formed. FS is routinely
employed for large-scale manufacturing of carbon black and differ-
ent oxides such as fumed silica, pigmentary titania, zinc oxide, and
alumina nanopowders. Currently, FS has also been successfully uti-
lized to produce 1D functional nanostructured materials grown
directly on substrates.

PThis review article consists of five main sections: (1) Introduc-
tion, (2) Solid-phase combustion synthesis, (3) Solution combustion
synthesis, (4) Gas-phase flame synthesis, and (5) Conclusions and
perspectives.

PSection 2 describes the synthesis of various nanostructured
materials by the SP-CS approach. Many aspects of the SP-CS process
are discussed, including thermodynamics, high-temperature-chem-
istry, and reaction mechanisms. In addition, relationships between
combustion parameters and the structural characteristics of as-pre-
pared nanomaterials are outlined. The SP-CS method highlights 0D,
1D, 2D, and 3D advanced inorganic compounds such as, transition
metals (Ti, Zr, W, Mo, Ta, and Nb), non-metals (B, Si, and C), metal

AlN).

PSection 3 reviews the SCS process fundamentals,

including
methodology, thermodynamics, kinetics, and nanostructure forma-
tion mechanisms during the self-sustaining reaction in the aqueous
solutions. The nanostructures are highlighted for a wide range of
inorganic compounds including simple oxides (ZnO, Mn3O4, CeO2,
WO3, MoO3, TiO2, NiO, Fe2O3, SnO2, etc.), pure metals and supported
metal nanostructures (Pt-Al2O3, Ni-SiO2, etc.), complex semicon-
ducting oxides (indium tin oxide, indium zinc oxide, and indium
gallium zinc oxide) and bioceramics (such as hydroxyapatite and
fluorapatite).

PSection 4 presents recent advances on synthesis of 1D nano-
structured thin films and their growth mechanisms comprehen-
sively. Flame assisted techniques for 1D hybrid structures are
also included. The potential applications of 1D nanostructured
thin films as catalysts for photoelectrochemical water splitting
and as electrode materials for lithium-ion batteries are out-
lined.

PSection 5 discusses and analyzes the current trends in the com-

bustion synthesis field, and the future perspectives.

PIn this article, the classification of nanomaterials is based on the
number of dimensions, which are not confined to the nanoscale
range (<100 nm). Four classes of nanomaterials are outlined: zero-
dimensional (0D), one-dimensional (1D), two-dimensional (2D),
and three-dimensional (3D). For 0D materials, all dimensions (x.y.
z) are in the nanoscale range. For 1D materials, two dimensions (e.
g. x,y) are on the nanoscale while one dimension (z) is not. 2D
materials have only one dimension in the nanoscale range, while
the remaining two are not. 0D nanomaterials include uniform
nanoparticles, core-shell spheres, spheres or clusters, all of which

Pare considered point-like particles. 1D nanomaterials include nano-
fibers, wires, rods, ropes, as well as bundles. Typical 2D nanostruc-
tures are films, plates, nanoflakes, and nanobelts. Finally, the 3D
units consist of a variety of nanostructures, e.g. nano particle skele-
tons (3D0), fiber-containing skeletons (3D1), or layered based skel-
etons (3D2).

2. Solid-phase combustion synthesis (SP-CS)

PSP-CS, as a chemical process for synthesizing useful inorganic
products, has been known since the last century when Beketov and
Goldschmidt performed self-propagating exothermic reduction
reactions between a metal oxide and aluminum. However, prior to
the development of modern combustion theory, it was difficult to
evaluate the prospects and potentialities of this approach to material
production. In 1967, the discovery of the solid flame phenomena i.e.
the self-propagating high-temperature synthesis, where both the
initial reactants and the final products are in the solid-phase, may be
considered to mark the beginning of the new synthesis era and,
with it, the development of the solid-phase combustion synthesis
approach.

2.1. Combustion reaction and process characterization

P2.1.1. Experimental set-up and synthesis procedure

PTypically, the SP-CS process is conducted in stainless steel high-
pressure reactor, under argon or nitrogen gas pressure (Fig. 1a). To
produce a reaction pellet, a solid reaction mixture of the desired
composition is prepared by mixing the precursor powders and com-
pacted into a cylindrical cup. C-type thermocouples (Tungsten-5%
Rhenium vs. Tungsten-26% Rhenium) are typically applied to

Pmeasure the values of thermoelectric voltage originated by combus-
tion wave. Ignition of the chemical reaction is achieved from the top
of the pellet (rarely from the bottom) by heat from a resistively
heated tungsten (or nickel-chromium) wire. The thermoelectric vol-
tages generated by the thermocouples are recorded by a data acqui-
sition system and then converted to temperature data in order to
obtain temperature-time profiles. After completion of the reaction,
the products are ground and, if necessary, transferred to a glass (or
plastic) beaker for further hydrothermal treatment. After purifica-
tion, the remaining solids are rinsed with distilled water and dried
at 80(cid:1)100°C.

P2.1.2. Initial systems and final products

PThe most popular route to produce refractory metal nanostruc-
tures by SP-CS is a metallothermic reduction of corresponding metal
oxides in the presence of alkali metal salts (MS) [12]:

2.2. Zero-dimensional (0D) nanostructures: Nanoparticles

P2.2.1. Refractory metals

PThe first review article devoted to the synthesis of 0D nanopar-
ticles of refractory metals from MexOy + yMg (or Zn) + kNaCl precur-
sor system using the SP-CS method was reported in [12]. Three basic
topics were examined in this report: thermodynamics of the process,
combustion wave parameters, and the characteristics of as-synthe-
sized refractory metal nanoparticles. Thermodynamic analysis of
adiabatic combustion temperature (Tad) and equilibrium reaction
phases was conducted by well-known software ‘THERMO’ designed
by Institute of Structural Macrokinetics and Materials Science Rus-
sian Academy of Sciences (ISMAN) [15]. Tad is the maximum temper-
ature when the process is performed under adiabatic conditions. The
value of Tad can be calculated on the basis of the following general
equation [6].

ð2Þ

PHere, MexOy (TiO2, ZrO2, Nb2O5, Ta2O5, MoO3, WO3, B2O3,
SiO2, etc.) is the oxidant, Mg (or Zn) is the reducing agent, and
MS (NaCl, KCl, NaF and KF) is a multifunctional additive to
reduce the process temperature and provide a molten reaction
medium so the as-formed metal nanoparticles can be preserved
from growth and oxidation processes. For most metal oxides, Mg
was used as a reducing agent, but for the thermally “weak”
oxides, such as WO3 and MoO3, Zn is preferable for creating low
temperatures. For synthesis of metal carbide nanoparticles (TiC,
WC, ZrC, B4C, SiC), amorphous carbon (black soot) or carbon
containing organic polymers (polyfluorotetraethylene (C2F4)n,
polyvinylchloride (C2H3Cl)n, polystyrene (C8H8)n, and polyethyl-
ene (C2H4)n) were also added to the MexOy + yMg(or Zn) + MS
mixture. The synthesis of metal nitride nanostructures, such as
AlN and BN was performed from the corresponding elements
and their compounds (oxides, halides) in a nitrogen atmosphere
in the presence of solid sources of nitrogen, such as ammonium
halides (NH4Cl and NH4F) and alkali metal azides (NaN3, LiN3).
The application of nitrogen-containing solid sources is a suitable
approach to increase the nitrogen concentration in the reaction
zone and to perform the synthesis process at a low nitrogen
pressure (0.5(cid:1)2.5 MPa range).

PA list of precursor materials frequently used in combustion
experiments and corresponding final products are shown in
Fig. 1b. The precursor materials are located in the left-side of
ordinate, called the pre-combustion zone, and the reaction prod-
ucts are located in the right-side of ordinate, called combustion
and after-combustion zones. Here, T* is the ignition point of the
precursor mixture, which usually corresponds to the melting
point of the reduction agent (Mg (923 K), Zn (692.5 K), or the
melting point of the inorganic salt used in the mixture (NaN3
(548 K), NaCl (1083 K) and NaF (1253 K).

P2.1.3. Combustion process

PThe combustion process in solid systems can be well illustrated
using a set of recorded n images in a B2O3-Mg-C system (Fig. 1c
[13]). After local ignition of the sample by an incandescent filament
(frame 1), a combustion wave is formed and propagates through the
cold sample (frames 2(cid:1)8). According to the presented images, the
wave shows a discrete character and consists of a number of bright
spots travelling in both longitudinal and transverse directions.
The small flame at the bottom of the pellet (frame 8) indicates that
the heat release has completed. After the wave has passed through
the entire sample, the light intensity from the sample surface
remains stable for tens of seconds. This observation provides visual
evidence of the afterburning stage, where prolonged bulk post-
combustion occurs.

PWhere DHf,298 is the reaction enthalpy and Cp is the sum of heat

capacities of the reaction products.

PThe software ‘THERMO’ also accounts for phase transitions; both

melting or boiling processes that occur during synthesis.

PThe slopes of Tad for the reduction of WO3, Ta2O5, and TiO2 using
Mg at To D 298 K are shown based on the NaCl concentration
(Fig. 2a). Additionally, the reduction of WO3 by Zn at T D 723 K is pre-
sented for comparison (the reduction reaction of WO3 by Zn is not
very exothermic and, therefore preheating of the initial mixture over
the melting point of Zn was used to initiate the synthesis reaction).
Fig. 2a shows that, in investigated systems, Tad decreases with an
increase of the mole number (k) of NaCl. The Mg reduction process
results in high adiabatic temperatures at k D 0: 3694 K (WO3 + 3Mg),
3090 K (Ta2O5 + 5Mg) and 2098 K (TiO2 + 2Mg); whereas the temper-
ature for the WO3 + 3 Zn system was only 1633 K. The preliminary
thermodynamic estimation of the adiabatic combustion tempera-
tures provided a good basis to the authors for successful implemen-
tation of synthesis experiments. The experimentally measured
temperatures (Tc) reported in, [12,16,17] are summarized in Fig. 2b.

Pcharacteristics of powders are shown in Table 1. Dine et al. [18]
investigated the milling-induced combustion process in WO3-Mg-
NaCl mixture to produce W nanoparticles. The process yielded
smaller tungsten particles, but with higher impurity of oxygen.

PThe reduction of thermally ‘weak’ oxides, such as WO3 and MoO3
by inorganic salts, such as sodium borohydride (NaBH4) and sodium
azide (NaN3) is an alternative route for synthesizing 0D W and Mo
nanoparticles. As reported in [19] very fine tungsten nanoparticles
were obtained after reduction of WO3 by NaBH4 and NaN3. Reaction
pathway analysis indicated the complex physicochemical nature of
the combustion process consisting of many elemental acts that pro-
ceed in different reaction zones: pre-combustion, combustion, and
after-combustion.

P2.2.2. Refractory metal carbides

PRecently, a series of methods have been reported for obtaining
refractory metal carbide nanoparticles. The techniques adopted for
carbide nanoparticle synthesis include the following: induction
plasma [20,21], ball milling [22(cid:1)25], chemical vapor condensation
[26,27], rapid carbothermal reduction [28,29], sol(cid:1)gel [30,31], and
laser pyrolysis [32,33].

PThe SP-CS reaction offers several advantages over these synthetic
routes. The grain size and product stoichiometry can be easily con-
trolled. The size distribution of the obtained powders is very narrow,
which enables assessment of size effects on different phenomena.
There is no oxygen contamination during the synthesis process. The
production rate is high, and the synthesis process can be easily
scaled-up. Three approaches for synthesizing metal carbide nano-
particles by SP-CS method can be mentioned based on the type of
precursor material: (1) the reduction of metal oxides in the presence
of carbon and an inert diluent; (2) the reduction of metal binary
and/or complex halides in the presence of carbon sources; and (3)
the synthesis of carbide phases from corresponding elements, where
inorganic compounds are also involved as a heat sink.

PThe main synthesis procedure of refractory metal carbides (TiC,
WC, MoC, TaC, NbC and ZrC) is analogous to refractory metal nano-
particles synthesis. The details of the synthesis procedure were
reported by Won et al. [14], where the entire combustion reaction
leading to the carbide 0D nanostructures formation was presented
as follows:

MOx + xMg + C + kNaF ! MC + xMgO + kNaF

(3)

PHere the stoichiometric factors, x and k, depend on the type of
metal oxide powder and the reaction conditions. For the investigated
metal oxides, the stoichiometric factor x is 2 (TiO2 and ZrO2), 3 (WO3
and MoO3), and 2.5 (Ta2O5 and Nb2O5). The stoichiometric factor k
depends on the exothermicity of the system, and the optimized val-
ues were 1.3(cid:1)1.5 (TiC and ZrC) and 7(cid:1)8 (WC, TaC, NbC) (see Table 1).

Fig. 3. TEM microstructures of refractory metal nanoparticles prepared by the SP(cid:1)CS
method. (adapted from [14]).

PFor the TiO2 + 2Mg + kNaCl system, the synthesis process is stable for
k D 0-1. For higher concentrations of NaCl (k>1), the combustion
wave is extinguished. The Tc for k D 1 in this system is 1580 K. For the
remaining systems, the stability limits are as follows: Ta2O5 + 5Mg,
k D 4 (1600 K); WO3 + 3Mg, k D 6.5 (1290 K); and WO3 + 3 Zn, k D 6
(920 K). Decreasing the combustion temperature decreases the wave
propagation velocities (Uc). As shown in Fig. 2c, the wave velocity
was decreased by almost an order of magnitude using NaCl additive:
near to combustion limit, the values of the Uc range from 0.05-
0.2 cm/s. Despite such a drastic decrease in the temperature, the
acid-leached samples were phase-pure metals (Fig. 2d). Sharp XRD
peaks indicate the highly crystalline nature of the metal nanopar-
ticles and the average crystal size (r), estimated from the broadening
of the X-ray peaks by Scherrer equation (r D Kλ/bcosu, where r is the
mean size of particles, nm; K is a dimensionless shape factor, which
has a typical value of 0.9; λ is the X-ray wavelength, nm; b is the line
broadening at half the maximum intensity (FWHM), in radians; and
u is the Bragg angle, in degrees) was in the 50-100 nm range.

PAs shown in Fig. 3, through the SP-CS process, ultrafine refractory
metal nanoparticles (less than 100 nm) are successfully synthesized.
The particles are round in shape and less agglomerated. The more

PThe values of the combustion temperature upon the mol number
of NaF for the MOx + xMg + C + kNaF system with different metal
oxides reported in [14] are shown in Fig. 4a. In the carbide systems,
a continuous decrease of the temperature occurred when increasing
the NaF concentration. With the selected amount of NaF (see Table 1)
the synthesis temperature drops below 1600 K. According to the
XRD patterns shown in Fig. 4b, cubic TaC, NbC, ZrC, and TiC, hexago-
nal W2C, and orthorhombic Mo2C carbide phases were obtained. The
average grain size reported in [14] ranges from 18(cid:1)42 nm (Table 1).
From the FESEM micrographs shown in Fig. 4 (c, d) it is evident that
the metal carbides consist of nanosized spherical particles. The par-
ticles are very uniform and well dispersed. Among the investigated
carbides, the smallest grains were observed for ZrC (18 nm), and
NbC had the largest grains (42 nm). All of the carbide particles dis-
played high surface area; the values range from 9.964(cid:1)45.576 m2/g.
PYermekova et al. [34] also used the magnesium reduction method
to produce 0D nanoparticles of SiC from SiO2-Mg-C mixture (without
alkali metal salt addition). The authors indicated that, while even
micro-size precursors lead to the formation of sub-micrometer par-
ticles, the scale of heterogeneity of SiO2 was a parameter which
allows one to control the size of SiC grains.

PThe second well-known approach for synthesizing 0D nanostruc-
tures of metal carbides (also silicides and borides) is the reduction of
metal halides (K2TaF7, K2TiF6, TaCl4, etc.) in the presence of carbon-
containing organic precursors. As reported in [35], a mixture of
K2TaF7-Si-(C2F4)n-C(B, Si) easily generated a self-sustaining low-
exothermic combustion wave, enabling the tantalum compound
nanoparticles synthesis. The reaction equation given below shows
the formation of these TaC (TaC/TaSi2 and TaC/TaB) nanoparticles
from K2TaF7 salt:

PK2TaF7 + 1.5Si + 0.25(C2F4)n + Si (or B) ! K2SiF6 + 0.5TaC + 0.5TaSi2 (or
TaB) + 0.5SiF4
(4)

PFig. 5a and b, adapted from [35], shows TEM, HRTEM, and SAED
(selected area electron diffraction) pattern for the TaC nanoparticles.
The relative intensities of the diffraction rings in the SAED pattern
correlate well with the standard XRD diffraction data for bulk cubic
TaC. The HRTEM image confirms that TaC particles are crystalline
with no lattice distortions, or fluctuations in the lattice spacing. The
size of individual nanoparticles measured from HRTEM ranges from
5 to 20 nm. A distance of approximately 0.3 nm between the lattice
fringes closely matched the d-spacing between the (111) planes of
the cubic TaC crystal structure (inset of Fig. 5b). The TEM image of
the TaC/TaSi2 in Fig. 5c shows the presence two sorts of particles:
large crystalline particles of approximately100nm with smaller ones
having a mean size of less than 20 nm. The authors suggest that the
large-sized particles (100 nm) were mainly TaSi2 and that the
smaller ones (20 nm) were TaC. Also, the diffraction rings of the cor-
responding SAED patterns indicate the existence of both TaC and
TaSi2 phases. The TEM image of the TaC/TaB composite shows nearly
uniform particles with sizes less than 50 nm (Fig. 5d). The SAED pat-
tern in the inset indicates the good crystallinity of the particles and a
multiphase composition of the product. The BET surface area of the
nanopowders is from 33 to 68.5 m2, depends on the powder compo-
sition (Table 2).

PThe reduction of K2TiF6 by aluminum in the presence of C, B, and
N2 to prepare TiC, TiB2 and TiN 0D nanostructures was reported in
[36]. The maximum temperature recorded in the hot sample was
from 1160 to 1440 K, and the size of TiC, TiB2, and TiN nanoparticles
was reported to be 5(cid:1)30, 10(cid:1)60, and 70(cid:1)100 nm in diameter,

Pdiameter was fabricated. Song et al. [40] fabricated ZrC ultrafine par-
ticles from Zr-C system diluted with Al powder. It was shown that
the reaction between Al and Zr to form ZrAl3 phase initially took
place, and then the reaction between molten ZrAl3 phase and C to
synthesize ZrC phase was followed. This process yielded spherical
and cubic type ZrC nanoparticles versus the content of Al in the ini-
tial mixture (Fig. 6).

P2.2.3. Metal nitrides

PThe synthesis approaches of metal nitride 0D nanostructures by
the SP-CS method can be classified into two main groups; (1)
metathesis exothermic reaction between metal chlorides or fluo-
rides and metal azides (Li3N, Na3N, Mg3N2 and Ca3N2), and (2) com-
bustion reaction between metal oxide and reduction agent in the
presence of solid nitrogen sources (NH4Cl and NH4F). In 1906, Gunz
and co-workers [41] observed that late transition-metal (Fe, Co, and
Cu) halides and Li3N react in an "incandescent" manner when heated
to 778 K, but the products, which were thought to be mixtures of
metals and metal nitrides, were not fully characterized and this
method was not pursued further. In early works of Parkin and co-
workers [42,43] was demonstrated that when a wide range of metal
chlorides are heated with lithium nitride to 778 K in sealed tubes,
similar violent reactions occur, leading to metal nitrides. O'Loughlin
et al. [44] performed solid-phase metathesis (exchange) reactions to
synthesize many different transition-metal nitrides (TiN, ZrN, TaN,
NbN and CrN). The process produced temperatures of greater than
1500 K resulting metal nitride 0D nanoparticles of different mor-
phologies and crystal structure. Metathesis combustion reaction
between AlCl3 and Ca3N2 used by Janes et al. [45] produced phase-
pure aluminum nitride nanoparticles. Using an in situ thermocouple
and a stainless steel vessel to hold the pressure, a reaction tempera-
ture of 1673 K was measured 0.8 s after initiation. Experiments with
Li3N, instead of Ca3N2, produce lower temperatures (1513 K) how-
ever, in both cases very fine AlN nanoparticles were obtained.

PRecently, an azide technology for synthesizing size tailored 0D
nanoparticles of ZrN was reported in [46]. The basic process was an
exothermic metathesis reaction between ZrCl4 and NaN3 in a nitro-
gen atmosphere:

ZrCl4 + 4NaN3 ! ZrN + 4NaCl + 5.5N2

(5)

PThe authors succeeded to decrease the synthesis temperature
from 1550 to 1020 K using NaCl salt as an additive. Produced by the
given approach ZrN nanoparticles displayed a very narrow size dis-
tribution (10-30 nm) and 50-70 m2/g specific surface area. By ana-
lyzing XRD, HRTEM, and SAED data, the authors concluded that ZrN
nanoparticles could be crystalline or quasi-amorphous depending
on the reaction temperature. In the similar manner, cubic delta-tan-
talum nitride (d-TaN) nanoparticles using a K2TaF7 + (5 + k)NaN3 +
kNH4F metathesis reaction under the combustion regime was pre-
pared in [47,48]. The combustion temperature when plotted against

and (d) TaC(cid:1)TaB nanopowders (adapted from [35]).

Prespectively (Table 2). A non-agglomerated nanometer-sized TiC
powder was obtained by Dyjak et al. [37] from 2TiCl4 + 7Mg + C2Cl6
reaction mixture loosely compacted in the graphite crucible.
After acid leaching and water purification, the reaction product was
calcined with Ca metal at 850-900 °C under argon atmosphere,
to remove residual carbon. The as-resulted TiC black powder was
consisted of spherical shape and uniform size particles, having
50-100 nm diameter and 29 m2/g surface area (Table 2).

PMetal carbide 0D nanoparticles can be also synthesized from the
corresponding elements. For instance, Jin et al. [38] attempted to
produce 0D SiC nanoparticles from the mechanically activated Si + C
mixture under 1.0 MPa nitrogen pressure. This approach was suc-
to produce b-SiC 200-500 nm nanoparticles. However,
cessful
a-Si3N4 and Si2ON2 phases were also detected in the final powder.
The synthesis of TiC nanoparticles from the Ti + C binary mixture
using NaCl was researched in [39]. It was shown that sodium chlo-
ride was effective to decrease the synthesis temperature and protect
the primary carbide particles from grain gross up to the end of com-
bustion reaction. As a result, nanosized TiC particles 100-500 nm in

Fig. 6. Typical microstructural morphologies of the synthesized ZrC ultrafine particles with (a) 30 and (b) 40, wt% Al contents. (adapted from [40]).

Pthe number of moles of NH4F used ranged from 1120 to 1440 K. At
the specified conditions, cubic d-TaN with 30.59 m2/g surface and
grain size of 5 to 10 nm was obtained. Analogically, Kim et al. [36]
attempted to produce TiN nanoparticles using K2TiF6 salt and alumi-
num as a reduction agent (instead of metal azide). The synthesis
temperature was only 1350 K and, even at this relatively low-tem-
perature, K2TiF6 was successfully converted into the phase-pure TiN
phase.

PA thermochemical pathway for the controlled synthesis of AlN
nanoparticles from the Al2O3(cid:1)Mg(cid:1)NH4Cl system was described in
[49]. The chemical reaction leading to the AlN phase formation was
presented as follows:

Al2O3 + (3 + 0.5k)Mg + kNH4Cl + N2 ! 2AlN + (3 + 0.5k)MgO + 0.5kMgCl2 +
2kH2 + 0.5kN2
(6)

PIn this approach, the synthesis temperature was controlled by the
amount of NH4Cl + 0.5Mg mixture. The authors succeeded to
decrease the temperature bellow 1870 K and produce phase-pure
AlN 0D nanoparticles. The diameter of the AlN nanoparticles and
specific surface area were 50(cid:1)200 nm and 20.8 m2/g respectively.

PThe TEM microstructures of TiN, AlN, ZrN and TaN nanoparticles
prepared by the above discussed approaches [45,46,48,49] are
shown in Fig. 7. The SAED patterns indicate the good crystallinity
and phase purity of nitride nanopowders. More information about
the combustion wave parameters (Tc, Uc), and the characteristics of
metal nitride nanopowders is shown in Table 3.

P2.2.4. Non-metal nanoparticles (silicon and boron)

PThis section describes the synthesis procedure of silicon and
boron 0D nanoparticles by the SP-CS process. Silicon nanoparticles
(Si-NP) are one of the most popular materials used in nanotechnol-
ogy today. It is an exciting and relatively new material with the
potential to revolutionize the electro-optic semiconductor industry,
which comprises solid state lighting, lasers, microelectronics and
biological tags [50(cid:1)53]. The synthesis of Si nanoparticles by SP-CS
method can be reached using different chemical approaches. Lee
et al. [54] and Yermekova et al. [55] reported the synthesis of Si
nanoparticles by magnesiothermic reduction of SiO2 in the presence
of NaCl. A unique metathesis reaction performed in Na2SiF6 + 4
NaN3 + kNaF (k D 0-4 mol) system [56] produced Si nanoparticles
less than 50 nm in diameter. In this process, three sodium salts,
Na2SiF6, NaN3 and NaF, are involved in the rapid metathesis reaction
which can be presented as follows:

Na2SiF6 + 4NaN3 + kNaF ! (6 + k)NaF + Si + 6N2

(7)

PSince the reaction temperature was low (1250 K), the nitridation
of silicon was not initiated and the combustion reaction resulted in
silicon spherical nanoparticles, 37 nm in mean diameter. Recently,

Psolid phase synthesis approach to amorphous boron nanoparticles
synthesis was reported in [57,58]. The synthesis was made from a
B2O3 + aMg non-stoichiometric mixture, where the concentration of
Mg was in the range of 1.0 (cid:2) a (cid:2) 1.5. The Mg deficiency decreased
the process temperature to 1570-1670 K and produced amorphous
phase boron spherical particles. Most of the particles were spherical
in shape, and the diameter of these particles was approximately
25(cid:1)100 nm. The purity of SP-CS synthesized boron was about 96-97
wt%. A similar approach used in [59] produced boron 0D nanopar-
ticles 350 nm in diameter and the purity less than 95 wt%. The com-
bustion parameters (Tc, Uc) and the characteristics of non-metal
nanoparticles prepared by various combustion approaches are sum-
marized in Table 4.

2.3. One-dimensional (1D) nanostructures

PRecently, one-dimensional (1D) nanostructures such as wires,
rods, belts, and tubes have become the focus of intensive research
owing to their unique applications in mesoscopic physics and nano-
scale device fabrication [60]. In the past 10-15 years, a variety of
chemical methods have been re-examined or demonstrated as

P“bottom-up” approaches for generating solid isotropic crystallo-
graphic structure to accomplish 1D growth; i) the introduction of a
liquid-solid interface to reduce the symmetry of a seed; ii) the use of
various templates with 1D morphologies to direct the formation of
1D nanostructures; iii) the use of super saturation control to modify
the growth habit of a seed; iv) the use of the appropriate capping
reagent(s) to kinetically control the growth rates of various seed fac-
ets; v) the self-assembly of 0D nanostructures; and vi) size reduction
of 1D nanostructures.

PThe SP-CS process to grow 1D nanostructures is based on vapor-
solid and vapor-liquid(cid:1)solid transition processes inside the reaction
pellet. Generally, the nanowires, nanorods, nanotubes or nanobelts
are produced when volatile compounds, such as ammonium salts
(NH4Cl, NH4F), metal azide (NaN3, LiN3) and organic polymers, such
as (PTFE-(C2F4)n and PVC-(C2H3Cl)n were used during the synthesis
process.

P2.3.1. Silicon carbide nanofibers

PIn 1995, Kharatyan and co-authors [61] reported that partially
replacing black soot with PTFE in the Si + (1-x)C(black soot) + x
(C2F4)n mixture, causes a small part of the SiC to be obtained as
nanowires. The authors also recorded formation of SiC nanowires
(whiskers) in SiC/Al2O3 and SiC/ZrO2 systems when organic poly-
mers were used as a source of carbon [62(cid:1)64]. The formation of SiC
nanowires was explained by a carburization reaction between sili-
con fluorides (SiFy, y D 2-4) and the gas-phase hydrocarbons, which
were formed after the thermal decomposition of polymers. The
diameter of the SiC nanowires was 50-500 nm and the length ranged
from several to hundreds of micrometers. The formation of SiC nano-
whiskers in the Al2O3/SiC system was also reported in [65]. At that, a
visible amount of SiC nanobelts was also detected along with nano-
whiskers. Alternatively, using carbamide (urea) as a promoter, as
conducted by Puszynski [66] and Wu [67], produced 3 mm long and
0.2-1.0 mm thin SiC whiskers. One typical micrograph of SiC
whiskers produced by SP-CS method [63] is shown in Fig. 8a. Huczko
and co-authors [68(cid:1)70] produced SiC nanofibers during the com-
bustion of Si-(C2F4)n, a highly exothermic mixture. This process

Pyielded b-SiC nanofibers approximately 20(cid:1)100 nm in diameter
with lengths of several microns.

P2.3.2. Aluminum nitride nanofibers

PIn 1999, Bradshaw et al. [71] reported the synthesis of AlN
nanofibers (or whiskers) using SP-CS. The authors investigated the
nitridation of Al in a nitrogen atmosphere and found that an approx-
imate 5 wt% addition of ammonia to nitrogen gas may cause the for-
mation of AlN nanowires. AlN whiskers were also obtained from the
Al nitridation reaction when 3 wt% MgCl2 was mixed with Al powder
[72]. Quasi-aligned and high aspect ratio AlN micro- and nanofibers
were prepared by reacting Al + 5 wt % (C2F4)n exothermic mixture
with nitrogen gas, as reported in [73]. The system temperature sta-
bly maintained between 1870 and 1970 K and structurally uniform
AlN micro- and nanofibers with hexagonal and cylindrical morphol-
ogies, having aspect ratios up to 2000, diameters in the range of
0.05-10 mm and lengths of 100-1000 mm were obtained (Fig. 8b).
Niu et al. [74] reported the fabrication of AlN whiskers via salt-
assisted combustion using Al + AlN + MeCl (Me is K, Na and Mg). The
synthesis of AlN from the Al + AlN mixture containing 5 wt. % NH4Cl
was studied in [75]. The uniform quasi-aligned nanowhiskers 60-
150 nm in diameter were grown along the [001] crystal axis.

P2.3.3. Boron nitride nanofibers

PBN nanotubes, including cylinder, wave-like, bamboo-like, and
bubble-chain were prepared by a two-step process (Fig. 8 c, d) [76].
Qian et al. [77] prepared Fe-filled BN nanotubes from a porous pre-
cursor of B31Fe17(MgO)27 obtained by combustion of B2O3 + Mg in
the presence of Fe2O3 and FeB. Then the as- prepared precursor was
heated to temperatures ranging from 1270 to 1470 K. Fe-filled BN
nanotubes were 20(cid:1)150 nm in diameter and 20 nm in wall-thick-
ness The authors heated the reaction mixture in an oven to 1020 K
to ignite a combustion reaction in the powder bed. The reaction
pathway was the following:

FeB1.3 + 6NH4Cl + 3Mg + Fe2O3 D 1.3BN + 3MgCl2 + 3Fe + 3H2O + 4.7
NH3 + 1.95H2

Fig. 8. 1D nanostructures prepared by SP(cid:1)CS method. (adapted from: (a) SiC [63], (b) AlN [73] and (c-e) BN [76]).

PThe studies described above indicate that the formation of 1D
nanostructures in the SP-CS process is based on the vapor phase
reactions inside the reaction pellet and this is the most widely
adopted approach to fabricate 1D nanostructures. Some halogen-
containing additives, such as (C2F4)n or NH4Cl, react with precursor
to produce low volatile metal and non-metal halides (TiF4, AlCl3,
SiF4, BF3 and C2F4) during the combustion process. Later, transport of
halide vapor and its condensation to the solid particle surface at low
temperatures produces nucleation and growth. Controlling the
amount of additives may allow for anisotropic growth of 1D nano-
structures by avoiding vapor supersaturation and nucleation pro-
cesses. Depending on the interface conditions (solid and/or liquid-
solid), the formation of 1D nanostructures in the combustion process
may occur by direct vapor-solid (VS) or vapor-liquid-solid (VLS)
crystallization mechanisms. The portion of 1D nanostructures in
combusted samples is small (several wt. %), because of the limited
pore volume and low additive concentration. The higher additive
concentrations may produce supersaturation, leading to uncontrol-
lable nucleation and growth. Therefore, to reach better controlla-
bility and to increase the amount of 1D nanostructures during SP-CS
process, non-standard approaches are needed.

2.4. Two-dimensional (2D) nanostructures

PIn recent years, the synthesis of 2D nanostructures has become a
focal area in materials research, owing to their many low-dimen-
sional characteristics diverging from bulk properties. These materi-
als can be promising for the sensor, photocatalysts, nanocontainers,
nanoreactors, and templates for 2D nanostructures. As of yet, no sig-
nificant recognition of research in 2D materials using the SP-CS has
been attained, however, visible progress was achieved within the
last few years.

P2.4.1. Boron nitride and carbide nanosheets

PRecently, 2D BN nanosheets (BN-NSs) have attracted interest
from the scientific community due to their structural similarity to
graphene and potential applications. It has been demonstrated
that BN-NSs exhibits remarkable mechanical properties and ther-
mal conductivity which makes it an extremely promising material
for use as filler in insulating composites of high mechanical prop-
erties and thermal conductivity. Lee and co-workers [13,78,79]
reported the synthesis of 2D BN nanosheets from a solid mixture
of B2O3 + (3 + 0.5k)Mg + kNH4Cl (k is mole number of NH4Cl) using
the SP-CS method. The influence of NH4Cl concentration on the
thermal wave parameters and the BN characteristics was investi-
gated. The authors observed a lowering of the synthesis tempera-
ture with increasing k. Fig. 9a shows the temperature-time
profiles, where Tc drops from 2200 to 1300 K when k increase
from 1 to 7 mol. It can be seen that the synthesis temperature has a
minor impact on the wave propagation velocity (inset of Fig. 9a). At
k D 1(cid:1)3, Uc shows a stable propagation rate (»0.3 cm/s), however,
at k>3, Uc was decreased to 0.2 cm/s (k D 7).

PX-ray analysis revealed that all samples prepared at k D 1(cid:1)7 con-
sisted of three main phases: BN, MgO, and MgCl. Therefore, after
acid leaching and water purification, single phase BN nanosheets
was obtained between k D 1(cid:1)7 (Fig. 9b). The XRD peaks widened
gradually with the increase of NH4Cl. This effect is most prominent
at k D 5 and 7. The broadening of XRD peaks in the B2O3 + (3 + 0.5k) +
kNH4Cl system is due to a decrease in the average crystallite size of
BN, which is caused by a reduction of the synthesis temperature.
TEM analysis performed for k D 2-7 (Fig. 9c(cid:1)f), revealed well-dis-
persed BN nanosheets with a thickness below 100 nm and edge size
greater than 1 mm at k D 2. For k D 5 and 7 (Fig. 9d,e), the surface of
BN nanosheets revealed structures with bifurcating curved fringes:
the lateral dimensions of the as-synthesized nanosheets ranged
from 50 to 1000 nm. In Fig. 9f, parallel line features can be observed

Palong the edge of the sheet under high magnification. The number of
atomic layers in one sheet ranges from 5 to 10, as estimated from
Fig. 9f. This allows for quantification of the number of layers and
measurement of the interlayer distance, which is around 0.33 nm.
SAED patterns of the BN nanosheets shown in the inset of Fig. 9e
suggest that all rings on the diffraction patterns belong to the hexag-
onal BN phase, which has a clearly recognizable crystalline structure
and lattice parameters of a D 2.5044Ao and c D 6.6562Ao. Essentially,
the formation of BN 2D nanosheets is driven by its hexagonal crystal
structure. The melted MgCl2 minimizes the energy between BN
layers and produces BN nanosheets consisting of a few atomic layers.
Furthermore, the melted MgCl2 not only increases the effect of exfo-
liation, but also stabilizes the exfoliated nanosheets and prohibits
restacking and aggregation.

PSP-CS was also adopted to produce high-quality two-dimensional
(2D) nanosheets of B4C [80]. The synthesis was conducted from a
reaction mixture comprised of boron oxide (B2O3), magnesium (Mg),
and polyvinylchloride (C2H3Cl)n, which serves as a carbon source.
Different morphological fragments of the B4C nanosheets were
detected by TEM analysis: hexagonal shaped nanosheets with edge

Plengths under 100 nm, slightly elongated nanosheets with hexagonal
and tetragonal shapes, and imperfectly-shaped nanosheets with
edge lengths above 100 nm.

PThe nanosheet thickness resulting from SP-CS ranged from 10 to
40 nm and, according to the selected area electron diffraction
(SAED) patterns, all rings indicated the rhombohedral B4C phase.
The authors suggested that 2D morphological unique modifications
of B4C were originated from temperature inhomogeneities in the
combustion wave, and the spinning character of the combustion
process. The growth mechanism for B4C nanosheets during SP-CS
was demonstrated to be a complex physical-chemical process that
involves many parallel and sequential chemical reactions, melting,
boiling, and crystallization. However, the authors [79,80] noted
three factors responsible for nanosheet formation: combustion
temperature, melting and decomposition of (C2H3Cl)n, and a large
amount of liquid B2O3 that was formed during the reaction. Particu-
larly, the melted B2O3 served as a reaction medium, where nucle-
ation and growth of B4C nanosheets could take place through a
dissolution(cid:1)precipitation mechanism. During the dissolution(cid:1)pre-
cipitation process, the liquid phase prevented physical contact

Pbetween individual nanosheets of B4C and grain growth proceeds.
Therefore, B4C nanosheets produced in a temperature range of
1670(cid:1)1970 K displayed relatively low thickness.

P2.4.2. Mesoporous carbon nanosheets

PThe discovery of a two-dimensional carbon allotrope, graphene
[81], marks an important breakthrough in physics. Two-dimensional
carbon ignited significant research efforts to produce carbon nano-
sheets with tunable electrical, mechanical, and optical properties as
well as with controllable size, shape, and chemical functionality.
Nanoscale electronics [82], nano- and biosensors [83], as well as
nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) [84] particularly benefit
from the incorporation of such two-dimensional carbon sheets in
composite materials and devices.

PSP-CS method for synthesizing 2D nanosheets of carbon has a rel-
atively short history and, therefore, few reports can be found in the
literature. The synthesis of carbon nanosheets by reacting silicon
carbide with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) was reported by Man-
ukyan and co-authors [85]. Experimentally, it was shown that tetra-
fluoroethylene (C2F4) formed after decomposition of PTFE, which
vigorously reacts with SiC, resulting SiF4 gas and mesoporous carbon
nanosheets. The continuous supply of carbon, in the form of C2F4
and higher reaction temperature (»1400 K), enables further rapid
growth of ‘‘freestanding’’ graphene 2D nanosheets. TEM images of

Pnanosheets adapted from [85] are shown in Fig. 10a, b. The edge size
of nanosheets is about 1 mm and the number of layers in sheet is
from 5 to10. The specific surface area of carbon nanosheets extracted
from the 17%SiC + 33%PTFE + 50%NaCl mixture was 430 m2/g. The
mechanism of freestanding graphene nanosheets formation needs
further explanation. However, we can assume that the thermal
decomposition of tetrafluoroethylene on the surface of SiC particles
may generate carbon nuclei, which is followed by aggregation and
sintering at high temperatures resulting in the formation of porous
graphene nanosheets.

PMore recently, Lee and co-authors [86] reported an ecolog-
ically friendly method for fabrication of carbon 2D hierarchically
porous nanosheets (HP-CNSs). A low exothermic Me2CO3 (Me is
Na or K) + Si mixture used in the combustion experiments
resulted in a sheet-type black carbon and water-soluble Na2SiO3.
TEM and HR-TEM micrographs of carbon produced in this process
are shown in Fig. 10c, d. These nanosheets are flexible; therefore,
parts of them were partially folded into nanotube-like structures.
Generally, the number of layers in one sheet can be ranged from
a few to 20 layers, and therefore the thickness of nanosheets is
between 1-6 nm Fig. 10d). The formation mechanism of HP-CNSs
is most likely driven by heterogeneous nucleation and aggrega-
tion of carbon nanoparticles in the molten silicate phases

PThe aggregation process of carbon nanoparticles leads to an
assembly of the relatively large clusters in the form of nanosheets,
which was confirmed by HR-TEM analysis. Huczko et al. [87]
extended the combustion route for processing Mg + C2.78F2 mixture
to 2D carbon materials. This process results in a bi-phase product
containing MgF2 and C, and after acid leaching of MgF2, planar
sheet-like graphite particles were produced (Fig. 10 e, f). The car-
bon nanosheets look transparent and featureless, and they are simi-
lar to few-layer graphene sheets entangled with each other. Those
multilayer carbon nanosheets can be up to tens square micro-
meters.

2.5. 3D complex and hierarchical nanostructures

P3D hierarchical structures derived from the nanoparticles (3D0)
or nanowires (3D1) or nanosheets (3D2) are attractive materials for
producing electronic and bio-imaging devices. The synthesis of 3D
structures by any of the existing methods is chemically and techno-
logically complex process, and SP-CS method is not an exception.
However,
in recent SP-CS reports, we have found synthesis
approaches of unique 3D inorganic nanostructures.

P2.5.1. Hollow carbon nanospheres

PHollow carbon 3D nanospheres (h-CNS) synthesis by SP-CS
method as a potential cathode material for lithium-sulfur (Li-S) bat-
teries was reported in [88]. The authors used organic halogen poly-
mer (C2H3Cl)n and/or (C2F4)n as a source of carbon, and sodium
azide (NaN3) as a reduction agent. The synthesis reactions with
(C2H3Cl)n was presented as follows:

NaN3 + (C2H3Cl)n ! NaCl + 2nC + 1.5nH2 + 1.5N2

(10)

PThe driving force of the reaction (10) is the heat of NaCl forma-
tion, which makes the reaction self-propagating. In the synthesis
process, the hydrogen evolved from polymer flows to the upper part
of the sample, and burns in the air creating an intense flame, as
shown in Fig. 11a.

PThe result was an increase of the overall system temperature up
to 1590-2020 K followed by the simultaneous formation of sodium
chloride-black carbon product (Fig. 11b). TEM image shown in
Fig. 11c demonstrate h-CNS obtained from (C2H3Cl)n: the diameter
and shell thickness are »100-500 nm and »20-50 nm respectively.
The diameter and shell thickness of the carbon nanospheres pre-
pared with (C2F4)n are approximately »50-200 nm and »10-20 nm,
respectively (Fig. 11d). We assume that the size difference between
the hollow spheres can be related to the combustion temperature,
which is 2023 K and 1590 K for (C2F4) and (C2H3Cl)n, respectively.
The size of the molten salt droplets increases with a decrease in the
combustion temperature, therefore the diameter of the h-CNS pre-
pared with (CH2-CHCl)n is larger than those obtained with (C2F4)n.
An alternative SP-CS route for synthesizing 3D graphene hollow
spheres was recently reported in [89]. A mixture of Mg/CaC2O4
reacted under the combustion regime resulted in carbon-covered
CaO nanocrystallites and layered graphene-related material mixture.
Acid leaching of CaO particles produced hollow graphene nano-
spheres.

PIn the above-mentioned cases, the mechanism for h-CNS forma-
tion is similar to the “self-template” approaches, and consists of the
following steps: (1) melting and coagulation of NaCl (or NaF) to form
spherical droplets; (2) thermal decomposition of halocarbons on the
surface of the molten salt droplets; (3) vacuum distillation of sodium
salts to produce h-CNS.

PHollow carbon nanospheres reported in [88] were also tested as
an electrode material for Li-S battery. First, sulfur was incorporated
into the core of h-CNS to make a cathode material. Galvanostatic
cycling was performed for 100 cycles at a rate of 0.5 C with charge
and discharge cut-off voltages of 3.0 and 1.5 V (vs. Li + /Li), respec-
tively. The specific capacity vs. voltage profiles for selected cycles
are shown in Fig. 12a [88].

synthesis; c) TEM images of (h-CNS) produced with (CH2-CHCl)n (inset is corresponding SAED patterns); d) TEM images of h-CNS produced with (C2F4)n.(adapted from [88]).

[88]).

PThe h-CNS-S(sulfur) cathode shows an initial discharge capacity
of »1318 mAh/g, whereas, the capacity of commercial carbon black-
sulfur cathode (CB-S) is only »1033 mAh/g) (Fig. 12b). The higher
discharge capacity of h-CNS-S results from its hollow structure,
which actively protects sulfur and sulfides against the electrical/
ionic isolation. During 100 repeated cycles, the capacity retention of
h-CNS-S electrode was better than the CB-S cathode. After the 100th
cycle, a discharge capacity of »700 mAh/g (»52% vs. the initial
capacity) was achieved with the h-CNS-S cathode, while the capacity
of CB-S cathode was only »286 mAh/g (»28% retention). Also, h-
CNS-S electrode showed negligible decay in the upper plateau region
as presented in Fig. 12a, which indicates that the hollow structure
created by the combustion process is able to successfully suppress
the dissolution of active materials and serve as a cathode material
for Li-S battery. The SP-CS produced 3D graphene [89] was also
tested as an electrode for supercapacitor applications. The specific
capacitance of the electrode made from 3D graphene was 187 Fg¡1
at the current density of 1 A/g.

Psensors, and optoelectronics. 3D lamellar graphene/BaFe12O19 com-
posite nanomaterial by SP-CS have been already reported by Zhao
et al. [90]. First, graphite was pre oxidized by concentrated sulphuric
acid/concentrated nitric acid/KMnO4 and then the combustion pro-
cess was realized on the precursor mixture containing pre oxidized
graphite sheets, citric acid and Ba(NO3)3. The temperature during
the reaction was increased up to 1500 °C and 3D lamellar graphene/
BaFe12O19 composite was formed. Fig. 13a shows the electromag-
netic wave adsorbing properties of lamellar graphene/BaFe12O19
composites versus the mass fraction of graphene and the best per-
formance was recorded with 30 wt. % graphene (Fig. 13 b).

PShin et al. [91] developed a one-pot processing method to pro-
duce a Fe3O4/C core-shell 3D nanocomposite. A nitrocellulose solu-
tion was impregnated into a thin layer of Fe2O3 and after the
evaporation of the solvent, the thin layer was locally ignited. The
thermal wave propagates along the interfacial boundaries between
the surface of Fe2O3 and nitrocellulose and produces Fe3O4/C core-
shell 3D nanocomposite.

P2.5.2. Carbon/metal oxide composites

P2.5.3. AlN 3D hierarchical structures

PComposite 3D nanomaterials have evoked significant scientific
and practical interest; this interest has been highlighted and demon-
strated in several articles and reports. The potential applications of
the resulting nanocomposites are varied, e.g., aerospace, automotive,

PThe synthesis of 3D porous shell, hollow nanospheres of AlN by
SP-CS was demonstrated in [92]. The starting materials mixture
composed of Al, AlN, and polytetrafluoroethylene (C2F4)n after the
combustion in nitrogen atmosphere produced AlN hollow 3D0

Pnanospheres. The diameter of these spheres was about 2(cid:1)3 mm,
similar to the diameter of the Al powder. This indicated that the Al
powder acted as a template for the growth of AlN hollow spheres.
Also, the shell of hollow sphere was porous and composed of a large
number of irregular nanoparticles 30(cid:1)120 nm in diameter, with
shell thickness of about 120 nm. Due to the high heating and cooling
rates during the combustion process, some nonequilibrium phases
and novel microstructures can be formed in the products. As
reported in [92], the combustion reaction of the Al + AlN + NH4Cl
mixture can produce imperfect flower-like 3D structures with

Pnumerous AlN islands sprouted from their surfaces. It has been
reported that the addition of NH4Cl to the reactant Al powder can
strongly promote the growth of 1D structures; the combination of
these 1D nanostructures produced 3D1 hierarchical structures.

PRecently, a number of high symmetry 3D AlN hierarchical struc-
tures were reported in [93]. These 3D AlN structures were excep-
tional, because they displayed 6-fold symmetry, like snowflakes, and
they were made from the Al + kAlF3 + N2 mixture. Fig. 14a adapted
from [93] shows 3D hierarchical AlN nanostructures classified from
their morphology: from simple to complex. The authors examined

Pthe morphological background of the combusted samples to under-
stand how AlN 6-fold crystals can grow during the combustion
reaction. Based on the experimental findings, a micro-explosion
mechanism was proposed to explain the formation of 3D struc-
tures. This mechanism includes the following steps: (1) melting
of Al particles inside protective Al2O3 layers (shells); (2) rapid
increase of pressure inside of the shells due to partial evaporation
of Al; (3) cracking of Al2O3 shells and consequent eruption of the
melted aluminum; (4) nitridation of the aluminum microdroplets,
resulting in the formation of AlN 3D hierarchical structures. A
model demonstrating this mechanism is shown in Fig. 14b. For
determining the growth directions, structure, and symmetry of
AlN crystals, the authors [93] attempted to calculate the surface
energies of different crystalline facets by using density functional
theory (DFT) calculations and the Wulff construction method
[94,95]:
DEsurf
ð11Þ
where DEcleavage D (Eb ¡ Ebulk)/2A and DErelax D (Eg ¡ Eb)/A are the
mean energy for creating the surface and the relaxation energy,
respectively; A denotes surface area. The calculation showed, that
the (01̅ 11) facet of the surface of the hexagonal pyramid facet
showed the highest surface energy (5.59 J ¢ m2) and therefore, it is
the thermodynamically most unstable area for conjunction of six
unit crystals to make flower-shaped design.

1⁄4 DErelax

PIt is worth mentioning that in the gas-phase flame synthesis field,
the micro-explosion mechanism is largely accepted to describe
nanoparticles formation in the multicomponent droplet system. For
instance, Takahashi et al. [96,97] described the disruptive burning of
slurry droplets composed of Boron/JP-10. They indicated three main
stages occur in the burning process: (1) uniform combustion accord-
ing to the d2-law; (2) shell formation at the droplet surface due to
volatility differences and pyrolysis; (3) microexplosions due to inter-
nal superheating of the high volatility component. Microexplosion of
a single isolated precursor/solvent droplet containing titanium

Ptetraisopropoxide [98(cid:1)100] and binary n-paraffin mixtures [101],
for nanoparticles production was also reported.

3. Solution combustion synthesis

PSCS has a relatively long history, which originated in the mid-
1980 s [102,103]. The pioneering work was published by Kingsley
and Patil in 1988 [9]. It was demonstrated that an aqueous solution
of aluminum nitrite (Al(NO3)3.9H2O) and urea (CH4N2O), when pre-
heated to 500°C, spontaneously ignited and after vigorous burning
resulted in the formation of highly porous fluffy product, which
appeared to be a-Al2O3.

PIn general, SCS relies on exothermic self-sustained reactions,
which can be accomplished using reactive solutions of oxidizer, typi-
cally metal nitrates, and organic fuels. In conventional schemes, the
process involves the following steps (Fig. 15a): (i) preparation of the
fuel/oxidizer aqueous solution in a chemical beaker; (ii) preheating
the reactive solution to the reaction initiation temperature (typically
between 150 and 500 °C); (iii) the combustion process, which occurs
between 500 (cid:1) 2000° C with a reaction duration ranging from sec-
ond to several minutes; (iv) and then the cooling stage.

PCurrently, many variations of SCS are exploited [103]. For exam-
ple, a reactive solution may be impregnated into reactive or inert
porous media, which is termed impregnation SCS [104(cid:1)108]. If the
porous media is used only as a template for the morphology of the
synthesized particles and is leached out after combustion, the
method is termed template SCS [109,110]. One may also spray a
reactive solution into a tube furnace in inert carrying gas, which
results in the synthesis of hollow metal spherical-like particles
through spray SCS [111]. Finally, the reactive solution can be dried
to make solid crystals and the combustion front may propagate
along the crystal, forming long (several cm) wires of different oxides
[112]. Detailed descriptions of these routes are provided in a recent
review [103]. Also depending on the heating conditions, SCS may
take place in either the volume combustion or layer-by-layer

Ppropagating combustion mode [6]. In the former case, the entire vol-
ume of the reactive media is uniformly preheated to the ignition
point (Fig. 15 a). In the latter case, the reaction is locally initiated
and the combustion front propagates along the rest of the media in a
form of the glowing reaction wave (Fig. 15 b, c). Thus, one can define
SCS as a complex self-sustained chemical process, which takes place
in a homogeneous solution of precursors. This process allows for
synthesis of a variety of nanoscale materials, including oxides, met-
als, alloys, and sulfides, which have many important applications
[102,103,113].

PIt is interesting that while solid-phase synthesis or self-propagat-
ing high-temperature synthesis (SHS) was established by experts in
the field of heterogeneous combustion [6,115], with initially minor
knowledge in material science, SCS was discovered by material sci-
entists whose understanding of the combustion phenomenon was
rudimentary. Thus, the current developments in SCS contribute, on
the one hand, in expanding the range of synthesized materials and
investigating their properties, on the other hand, in studying the
complex reaction mechanisms that occur during combustion of this
molecularly mixed reactive solution. It has been recognized, that
based on fundamental knowledge of SCS it is possible to control the
microstructure of the synthesized materials and hence their proper-
ties. Thus, before we overview SCS-produced materials with differ-
ent morphologies, let us briefly discuss recent accomplishments on
the fundamentals of combustion in these systems.

3.1. Fundamentals of SCS

PFollowing the general methodology, which was established for
SP-CS processes one may divide fundamental SCS studies into: (i)
thermodynamics; (ii) kinetics; (iii) combustion mechanism; (iv) the
structure formation mechanisms under unique conditions of self-
sustained reactions [116].

P3.1.1. Thermodynamics

PThermodynamic calculation for combustion systems provides
information about equilibrium reaction products, as well as on maxi-
mum (adiabatic) temperatures, which can be reached in the reaction
front. These combustion parameters are essential for the material syn-
thesis aspect [117]. For example, in numerous experimental works, it
was demonstrated that the phase composition, particle size, and
shape of SCS products may be changed by varying the fuel/oxidizer
(F/O) ratio [113]. The analysis shows that the adiabatic combustion
temperature significantly changes with a variance of the F/O ratio
[118(cid:1)120]. However, the dependences are different when accounting
for the reaction between the fuel and oxygen in the surrounding

Patmosphere. Fig. 16a demonstrates how Tad changes with an increase
of the F/O (F) ratio for the SCS reaction to produce WO3.

PIt can be seen that maximum temperature gradually increases
with the increase of F ratio. This behavior occurs because excess fuel
reacts with oxygen from the air. Fig. 16b illustrates the dependence
of the adiabatic temperature in the iron nitrate - glycine system if
participation of gas phase oxygen is not accounted for. In this case,
the maximum combustion temperature occurs at the stoichiometric
F ratio. Whether to account for the reaction of fuel with air depends
on the kinetics, e.g. infiltration rate of oxygen to the reaction surface.
A comparison between the calculated Tad and the measured temper-
ature may provide useful information on the combustion mechanism.
Typically, experimentally defined combustion temperatures at high
F are lower than the calculated ones, which suggest that oxygen
from the air does not participate in the combustion reaction and oxi-
dation may take place in the post-combustion zone.

PIn addition, Fig. 16b shows the amount of gas phase product as a
function of the F ratio. It can be seen that, while Tad decreases for
F values above stoichiometry, the amount of gas phase products
continuously increases. These two effects i.e. lower combustion tem-
perature and a large amount of gas phase products, both favour for-
mation of fine structures. This example elucidates how the
thermodynamics may help for optimization of the structure forma-
tion conditions during SCS.

PIt is even more important that such calculations can suggest the
synthesis conditions for the desired product phase composition.
Fig. 17 illustrates this concept [114]. It can be seen that, for the nickel
nitrate-glycine (Fig. 17a) and cooper nitrate(cid:1)glycine (Fig. 17b) sys-
tems, for F>1.25 one can synthesize pure metal (Ni, Cu) phases.
However, for the cobalt nitrate (cid:1) glycine system (Fig. 17c), to pro-
duce pure metal a higher F ratio should be used. Finally, one cannot
synthesize pure iron using the iron nitrate-glycine reaction
(Fig. 17d).

PTo conclude this section, we may state that thermodynamic cal-
culations are a powerful tool, which provides insight on the synthe-
sis conditions and is finding widespread use in the SCS community.
However, use of available advanced thermodynamic software pack-
ages, which allow simultaneous calculation of equilibrium products
and combustion parameters is recommended [117,119].

P3.1.2. Kinetics

PThe reaction kinetics is an important, but difficult to investigate,
part of combustion science. Very little work has been published on
chemical reaction kinetics in solution or in condensed reactive
media (gels and crystals) prepared from solutions. Two main
approaches have been used. The first is based on thermogravimetric

atungstate -ammonium nitrate (adapted from [120]); (b) glycine (cid:1) iron nitrate (adapted from [118]).

ammonium nitrate system. (adapted from [114] and [120]).

Por differential thermal analysis (TGA, DTA) methods, which are
often combined with in-situ mass-spectroscopy (MS), which
allows for the definition of several parameters. One may define
the reaction initiation temperature and the possible existence of
different reaction stages. The example shown in Fig. 17 e,f illustrates
this approach. It can be seen that the exothermic reaction in the
glycine - ammonium paratungstate - ammonium nitrate system
starts at » 470 K (Fig. 17e) and involves at least two stages (Fig. 17f).
The latter is suggesting by 2-3 MS peaks for gas phase products.

PThis analysis allows researchers to make an important conclu-
sion; the reaction initiation temperature is typically associated with
decomposition or melting points of a fuel or oxidizer [103,113]. In
particular, it means that this parameter does not depend on the
heating rate and one may expect similar behavior in the combustion
wave. Many papers also report on the complexity of reaction kinetics
during solution combustion, which may involve multiple reactions
[102,103,113].

PIn addition, obtaining DTA data at different heating rates and
using the Kissinger approach for data analysis, one may extract the
activation energy of the considered reactions [121]. For example, in
the nickel nitrate - urea system, it was shown that the activation
energy is »175 kJ/mol, which is only slightly higher than the thermal

Pdecomposition of anhydrous nickel nitrate (153 kJ/mol) [122]. Using
a similar approach for kinetics studies in the nickel nitrate (cid:1) glycine
system with F D 1.75, it was shown that two consecutive reactions
govern the process [123]. The first reaction occurs between NH3 and
HNO3 which are the main gas products formed during the decompo-
sition of glycine and nickel nitrate. The activation energy of this reac-
tion is 125 kJ/mol. The second is the reduction of NiO by hydrogen
and this reaction has an activation energy of about 110 kJ/mol.

PThese results again imply that the decomposition of the fuel and
oxidizer may control the reaction. An important conclusion can be
made from these observations for material applications. Indeed, this
suggests that one should not use high-temperature furnaces for SCS.
A temperature near that of the precursor decomposition (typically
do not exceed 520 K) is sufficient to initiate the reaction in either the
volume or self-propagating CS modes. In turn, lower temperatures
favor the formation of finer particles; achieving the nano-scale size
of the combustion products is typically the reason for use of SCS.

PThe second approach is based on using time-resolved x-ray dif-
fraction (TRXRD), which obtains data on the phase formation kinet-
ics during combustion [114,124]. An example of XRD-patterns
taken every 0.5 s during the combustion front propagation in nick-
el-nitrite- glycine system is shown in Fig. 18a and the corresponding

Pkinetic curves for Ni and NiO phase formation synchronized with the
temperature-time profile of the reaction front in Fig. 18b [124].
While the relatively low heating rates in DTA-TGA experiments, it
was shown that the NiO phase formed first and only much later (sec-
onds), does the Ni phase first appear, in the rapid heating conditions
of the combustion wave, these phases formed almost simulta-
neously. Usage of in-situ diagnostics is the future of SCS, especially
because current TRXRD devices permit time resolution on the order
of microseconds or even faster [6].

PThis overview shows that, while the kinetics are a key for control-
ling the reaction conditions and is essential for materials synthesis,
intensive and deep research is required to create a representative
database. It is important that all required diagnostics, including in-
situ and operando tools, which are currently available, are utilized.

P3.1.3. Mechanism and Theory

PA joint analysis of the thermodynamics and kinetics with direct
measurements of the temperature time history allows for the formu-
lation of the combustion mechanism, which takes place during the
synthesis of various materials [6]. For such a complex phenomenon
such as SCS, the mechanism means understanding the reaction
sequence, which is responsible for combustion and product forma-
tion, combined with knowledge of their apparent kinetics, which
account for heat and mass transfer processes. Ideally, based on the
suggested mechanism, a mathematical model may be suggested
which allows the description of the observed combustion features
and for prediction of the system behavior under different conditions.
We have to admit that very few works about SCS mechanisms have
been reported in literature. Let us briefly summarize these findings.
PThere is the common agreement in the literature that SCS starts
with dehydration and thermal decomposition of the homogeneous
solution [103,113]. Again, research has reported that the reaction
initiation temperature for many systems is in vicinity of the decom-
position (melting points) of the fuel or oxidizer. This conclusion was
confirmed by TGA-DTA of the reactive solution and by direct mea-
surement of
the ignition temperature for different systems
[123,125]. It is worth noting that the melting point of the less refrac-
tory compound is typically equal to the ignition temperature in gas-
less reactive systems [6]. Thus, congruent or incongruent phase
transformations play an important role in the combustion phenome-
non. A variety of chemical species is formed during this first stage of
chemical interactions, including different acids (e.g. isocyanic, cya-
nuric), nitrogen oxides, hydrazine, and of course water vapor. Also,
these gaseous species may form hypergolic combinations when they
encounter each other. In principle, the condensed mixture of the
decomposed species also can be exothermic.

PThus on the second stage, several thermally coupled exothermic
reactions could be responsible for the self-sustained combustion
process, which results in the formation of at least one primary solid
product and a large amount of gas. Two limiting scenarios are

Ppossible: (i) solely gas phase combustion takes place; (ii) reaction
occurs owing to the combustion of condensed media. The first case,
assume exothermic gas phase reactions between gaseous products
of solution decomposition provide extremely high temperatures. For
example [114,124],

N2O (g) + NH3(g) ! N2 + H2O (Tad range 2400 -1600 K)
or

(12)

NHO3 (g) + HN3(g) ! N2 + H2 + H2O (Tad range 2300 -1300 K)

(13)

PSimultaneously, the further decomposition of nitrate leads to the
formation of the corresponding metal oxide. For material fabrication,
it is just nitrate decomposition, which takes in the gas phase burner.
Note that combustion and the structure formation processes are not
“cross-linked” as one typically observes for gasless CS reactions,
where the combustion reaction directly leads to the formation of the
valuable product. For the SCS process, the reaction products formed
in the leading front are in the gas state and escape the media, being
out of interest. It was reported that this mechanism of spongy struc-
ture formation was observed for the nickel nitrate (cid:1) glycine system
(Fig. 19a).

PThe second limiting case is when all formed gaseous species are
not reactive and the combustion reaction occurs in the condensed
phase. For example, between a cyanuric acid (boiling point »600 K)
and aluminum nitrate [102]. In this case, the reaction takes place on
the boundary between condensed phases with product formation in
the combustion front. Fig. 19b shows a frame of high-speed micro
recording of combustion for an iron nitrate (cid:1) glycine gel. It can be
seen that, at one spot on its surface, there is a bright reaction front
from which a very long “wire” of iron oxide product grows into the
open space. This hot spot moves along the surface of the gel leading
to the formation of extremely long (several cm) metal oxide wires
[112].

PThe third stage of chemical

interactions, which is extremely
important for material science applications, may include: (i) the
reduction reaction between the primarily metal oxide and the reduc-
ing atmosphere of the surrounding gas phase [123]; (ii) solid-state
interaction between the primarily solid-state product and air [125].
In the former case, the reducing atmosphere (H2, NH3) may be
formed during the gas phase combustion reaction or one may per-
form experiments in a hydrogen atmosphere. In the latter case, the
primary products typically react with oxygen in the air which infil-
trates its highly porous skeleton. Fig. 19c illustrates the complexity of
the reaction mechanism in the nickel nitrate (cid:1) glycine system, and
schematically shows the existence of all described combustion stages.
PAn attempt to model the role of the released gases, as well as to
prove the necessity of the chemical reaction sequence during SCS for
an explanation of the observed experimental temperature-time pro-
files were made in two models [126,127]. Both models describe

Pimpregnated active layer (typically cellulose) combustion synthesis
(IALS), which is widely used for preparations of different catalysts
[105(cid:1)108]. The IALS consists of four stages: (i) impregnation of the
reactive solution into a porous matrix; (ii) drying of the prepared
reactive media to evaporate the water; (iii) local (»1mm3) initiation
of the reaction; (iv) combustion wave propagation along the media,
with formation of the desired solid product from the impregnated
solution and simultaneous conversion of the cellulose matrix to the
gas phase (CO, CO2) by its reaction with air oxygen. Two combustion
reactions, i.e. in the reactive solution and between the active matrix
media and oxygen, interact with each other leading to combustion
front propagation along the sample.

PThe first model is focused on the effect of released gas phase
products on the combustion temperature and the reaction front
propagation velocity [126]. It was shown that: (i) the formed gas
phase products diminish the combustion temperature and reduce
the combustion wave propagation velocity; (ii) the released gases
also increase the total porosity of the media and thus further
increase the heat losses; (iii) a much higher thermal conductivity of
the formed solid product also reduces the combustion front velocity
and increases its width. Owing to these effects, a rapid temperature
drop is observed behind the combustion front, which leads to rapid
product cooling without adequate sintering time. The latter makes
the IALS suitable for synthesis of nanopowders with high surface
area.

PThe second model accounts for the sequence of the three reac-
tions, i.e. the exothermic reactions in the impregnated solution and
the cellulose burning, as well as an endothermic reaction associated
with the decomposition/gasification of the precursors [127]. It was
considered that the solid product formation reaction trails burning
of the carrier matrix, as takes place during IALS SrRuO3 [128,129]. It
was shown that increasing the heat released via cellulose burning,

Presults in a higher degree of conversion, smaller reaction time, and
smaller distances between the two exothermic fronts. These effects
are favorable, however higher combustion temperatures may lead to
coarsening of the synthesized powders. The endothermic reactions
that are experimentally controllable, for example, through optimiza-
tion of drying process prior to IALS, were also analyzed. It was found
that increasing the heat absorbed leads to decrease of combustion
temperature and significantly diminishes the distance between the
exothermic fronts, simultaneously reducing the degree of conver-
sion. However, the reduction in product yield is not substantial and
thus by controlling the heat absorption via the endothermic reac-
tions one may effectively control the size of the fabricated particles.
PThe mentioned examples demonstrate that knowledge of the SCS
reaction mechanism, along with modeling, permit non-trivial con-
clusions related to process control and increase the possible applica-
tions of this unique approach for material fabrication. We believe,
that deep understanding of the combustion phenomenon in reactive
solutions will soon allow fabrication of almost all known species of
materials, including carbides, nitrides, and other ceramic materials.
Below we briefly overview materials with porous, hierarchical, zero-
, one-, and two-dimensional structures, which were produced by
SCS in recent years, hoping that the examples shown demonstrate
the uniqueness of this combustion-based approach.

3.2. Microstructure and properties of SCS-derived nanoscale materials

P3.2.1. Porous and hierarchical structures

PHeating reactive solutions containing metal nitrates and organic
fuels often generates a gel-like media due to evaporation of the sol-
vent. The continuous increase of viscosity, along with the gas release
due to reactant decomposition and the exothermic reaction, triggers
spontaneous nucleation and rapid solid product growth. The

Pmorphology and properties of the final product largely depend on
the fuel to oxidizer ratio, the chemical composition of the fuel, pH of
the solution, heating rate, and the gel characteristics. The reaction
temperature and the quantity of gas product, however, are the most
critical parameters that determine the final product microstructure.
The temperature facilitates grain growth, agglomeration, and sinter-
ing. The release of a significant volume of gas, on the other hand,
prevents severe aggregation of the product particles. These two
competing factors result in porous solids consisting of randomly
assembled near-spherical or irregular isotropic grains with size
ranging from 50 to 100 nm.

PA typical example of such structure is ZnO with hexagonal wurt-
zite fine nanoparticles (Fig. 20a) prepared by microwave - assisted
combustion synthesis [130]. Nanoscale Mn3O4 material with porous
hierarchical structure (Fig. 20b) prepared by reactive solution igni-
tion in a preheated furnace is another type of SCS-derived micro-
structure [131]. This material has shown the best catalytic
performance in total oxidation of some organic compounds, such as
ethylene, propylene, toluene, and their mixtures, compared to other
manganese oxides produced by similar SCS reactions.

[130], Mn3O4 [131], Ni [114,132], CeO2 [133], Cr2O3 [134]).

PDepending on the synthesis conditions, many variations of this
typical SCS microstructures are possible. One type is crystalline
metallic foams prepared by fuel-rich reactive solutions. For example,
nickel foams (Fig. 20c) produced by combustion of nickel nitrate +
glycine solutions exhibit large pores with sizes ranging from 0.1 to
3 mm [132]. This foam also contains much smaller pores (Fig. 20d)
with sizes ranging from 100 to 500 nm [114]. It is interesting that
the metallic crystallites (Fig. 20d) are larger (100-300 nm) than the
oxide nanoparticle produced by combustion of near-stoichiometric
reactive solutions [114]. This fact can be explained by the relatively
low sintering temperature of metals.

PDespite many advantages, SCS, until recently, suffered relatively
low levels of control over the morphological uniformity of the fabri-
cated materials. The preparation of regular, uniform, non-agglomer-
ated nanoparticles or ordered porous nanostructures was
challenging due to the rapid and high-temperature nature of the
process. Recently, a number of published articles indicate that cou-
pling the reactive solution with different templates and post-com-
bustion chemical or thermal treatment may significantly increase
the morphological diversity of SCS products. For example, Voskan-
yan et al. recently utilized templates to control the pore size of com-
bustion synthesized CeO2 [133]. Colloidal SiO2 nanoparticles with
size »20 nm were added to cerium nitrate - glycine solutions, which
were then heated on a hot plate until combustion reaction initiation.
The combustion products were treated with a sodium hydroxide
solution to remove the template. Fig. 20e illustrates that the CeO2
has ordered porous structure with pore size »20 nm. The obtained
mesoporous CeO2 exhibited excellent catalytic activity for soot and
carbon monoxide oxidation.

PFor example, mesoporous ceria prepared by template-assisted
SCS (denoted as ceria-3) facilitates 100% CO conversion at 770 K
(Fig. 20f) due to the high surface area, high porosity, small crystal
size, and increased Ce3 + concentration on the oxide surface. The cat-
alytic activities of combustion synthesized ceria prepared without a
silica template or commercial powder are much lower and complete
oxidation could be achieved only at »680 and 770 K, respectively.

PThe same group of authors also reported a sacrificial templating
approach for producing high surface area mesoporous Cr2O3 nano-
particles with octahedral shape [134]. Porous chromium-organic
crystals were prepared first by hydrothermal reaction of a chromium
salt and an organic ligand. Then, a reactive solution of chromium
nitrate and glycine was impregnated into the porous precursor.
Combustion of as-prepared powder led to the formation of octahe-
dral Cr2O3 nanoparticles (Fig. 20g). TEM images (Fig. 20h) indicates
that a large octahedra particle consists of small nanocrystals with an
average diameter of »20 nm.

3.3. Zero-dimensional (0D) nanostructures

PIncorporation of inert solid supports, such as alumina or silica,
could significantly prevent the aggregation and sintering of SCS-
derived nanoparticles. For example, Zavyalova and co-workers pre-
pared a catalytic system of platinum nanoparticles with diameter less
than 10 nm uniformly distributed on a-Al2O3 (Fig. 21a) using a micro-
wave-assisted gel-combustion synthesis [135]. The authors suggested
tetraammineplatinum nitrate (Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2) complexation
that
with glycerol fuel, as well as their subsequent high-temperature com-
bustion reaction on the surface of the support, followed by rapid cool-
ing, which favors the formation of dispersed metal nanoparticles and
prevents sintering. They also prepared the same catalysts by conven-
tional incipient wetness impregnation without glycerol addition fol-
lowed by calcination and reduction at 870 K. The adhesion tests
performed in an ultrasonic bath showed that high-intensity vibrations
of SCS-derived materials for extended periods of time result in only
negligible weight loss, proving that the adherence between the metal
nanoparticles and alumina support is excellent.

PCross and co-authors reported on the preparation of a dispersed
Ni phase by immersing a porous g-Al2O3 into reactive solutions con-
taining nickel nitrate and glycine, followed by initiation of combus-
tion [136]. Cross et al. have also reported direct synthesis of Ni
nanoparticles supported on fumed silica. In this case, they mixed a
reactive solution of nickel and ammonium nitrate with glycine and
fumed silica powder to obtain a soft gel-like mixture [137]. The com-
bustion of this mixture in argon resulted in dispersed metal nano-
particles with sizes below 10 nm (Fig. 21b). This approach also
allowed for in situ passivation of Ni nanoparticles through the for-
mation of a thin (»1 nm) amorphous oxide layer from the oxygen
impurity in argon gas. This catalyst possesses high activity during
ethanol decomposition into hydrogen at 470 K and excellent stabil-
ity toward deactivation with no change in catalytic activity over
100 h.

PManukyan et al. loaded mesoporous silica (SBA - 15) with a con-
centrated reactive solution containing glycine, iron, and ammonium
nitrates [109]. After drying, the powder was cold pressed to com-
pact samples and combustion initiated by local preheating. The
resultant materials were then subjected to selective removal of the
template to produce zero-dimensional hematite (a-Fe2O3) nano-
particles with average size of » 4 nm (Fig. 22a). The template with
ordered hexagonal channeled structure prevented the growth of
hematite particles even though the reaction temperature was high
(»1020 K). The primary determining factor for the nanoparticle
sizes was found to be the channel diameter in the silica template.
Compared to SCS, the template-assisted calcination at the same
temperature required at least several hours to obtain crystalline
nanoparticles. Such long process, however, also facilitates signifi-
cant growth of iron oxide particles, which eventually cause fractur-
ing of mesoporous template channels. It is also interesting that

Phematite nanoparticles produced by template-assisted SCS exhibit
unusual magnetic properties.

It

tion.
hematite nanoparticles reaches 21 emu/g at 10 kOe, which is the
largest net magnetization ever observed for the hematite phase. At
5 K, a hysteresis loop with a significant coercive field and a remnant
magnetization (Fig. 22c), resembling weak ferromagnetic behavior
was observed. The authors suggested that the record high magneti-
zation in these nanoparticles can be explained by the contribution
of a shell of uncompensated surface spins, which tend to interact
ferromagnetically, which surrounds an antiferromagnetic core of
the hematite.

PWu et al. produced CeO2:Sm3 + nanophosphors utilizing polyvinyl
alcohol as a soft sacrificial template. In this process, the cerium and
samarium nitrates, urea, and polyvinyl alcohol were mixed and the
aqueous solutions were transferred into a preheated furnace to initi-
ate the combustion reaction at 820 K [138]. The polyvinyl alcohol
served as a soft template limiting the agglomeration; this produced
fine spherical nanoparticles with a size of »10 nm. It was shown
that these materials could be excited with 370 nm UV light and
emitted an intense orange-red light after an appropriate post-com-
bustion heat treatment. The samples obtained by template-free
combustion showed weak luminescence even after prolonged heat
treatment.

PAll of the above results indicate that reactive solution combina-
tion using a solid inert support or templates provides new possibili-
ties for development of novel nanoscale materials with modulated
structures. Both of these approaches prevent sintering and preserve

Pthe primarily formed structures, thus resulting in ultra-low size
nanoparticles or nanotubes.

3.4. One-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) nanostructures

PRecent reports show that SCS allows for preparation of nano-
tubes, nanowires, nanorods, nanoplates, nanosheets, and nanoflakes.
Several works used a porous anodic aluminum oxide template to
prepare arrays of hydroxyapatite [110], ceria [139] barium ferrite
[140] nanotubes or nanowires by sol(cid:1)gel combustion. In the case of
hydroxyapatite nanotubes, the water soluble calcium nitrate and
ethylene glycol were mixed with PO(CH3O)3 in ethanol [110], then
an alumina template was immersed into the solution for 10 min at
ambient temperature. The template was then washed, dried and
transferred into a preheated furnace at 150 °C for combustion initia-
tion. Concentrated sodium hydroxide solution was used to dissolve
the template. The prepared hydroxyapatite nanotubes have a length
of 10 - 50 mm and diameter of »100 nm (Fig. 23a, b). The BaFe12O19
nanowire arrays prepared with alumina templates exhibit high
saturation magnetization (»60 emu/g), coercively in the range of

arrays; (c, d) bundle and single VO2 nanorod; (e, f) MoO3 and WO3 nanorods; (g, h)

P6000 Oe, and magnetic anisotropy due to the magneto-crystalline
anisotropy [140].

PHollow CuO microfibers were also successfully fabricated by
incorporation of cotton fibers as biotemplates. The natural cotton
was impregnated with a reactive solution containing copper nitrate
and glycine, and was followed by heating in a furnace to initiate the
reaction [141]. The as-prepared material was tested for sensor appli-
cations and exhibited superior sensitivity coupled with high selec-
tivity for detection of n-propanol.

PCuO nanosheets are another type of structures that can be pro-
duced with this method. When synthesized, they have thickness
»50 nm, and were assembled together on a common basis recently
prepared by ignition of a copper nitrate - glycine solution in a fur-
nace at 300°C [142]. It is interesting that the use of citric acid as the
fuel instead of glycine resulted in the formation of nanorods with
diameter of 20¡25 nm and length ranging from 100 to 250 nm
[143].

PNagabhushana and Chandrappa reported on the synthesis of sin-
gle crystalline monoclinic VO2 nanorods by immersing a solution
containing ammonium metavanadate (NH4VO3) and malic acid into
a muffle furnace maintained at 740 K for »5 min to initiate the reac-
tion [144]. Then, the solution was taken from the furnace and
allowed to undergo slow smoldering combustion at room tempera-
ture. TEM images of the product indicate that single crystalline
nanorods of VO2 with an approximate length of 600 nm are assem-
bled in larger bundles (Fig. 23c, d). The growth mechanism for these
nanorods is unknown. However, the authors noted that if the com-
bustion reaction was allowed to proceed in the furnace, the VO2
would oxidize to form V2O5 with isotropic grain morphology. On the
other hand, slow smoldering combustion allows complete removal
of carbon residues by formation of CO2 gas that preserves the VO2.

PVidya and co-authors reported the synthesis of MoO3 and WO3
nanorods utilizing a single step solution combustion process [145].
They used ammonium molybdate or ammonium paratungstate as a
molybdenum source or tungsten, respectfully. Citric, nitric acids,
and ammonia were added to the water solutions of these com-
pounds. The solutions were then heated using a hot plate to initiate
the combustion reaction. TEM images show that the width of as-pre-
pared MoO3 nanorods is nearly 15 nm, whereas their length is more
than 50 nm (Fig. 23e). WO3 nanorods are thinner than MoO3, with
8 nm width (Fig. 23f). The WO3 nanorod length varies from 40 to
100 nm. The synthesis of these one-dimensional nanostructures is
surprising since Morales et al. [146] and Chen et al. [120] reported
preparation of WO3 with isotopic grain structure utilizing glycine,
urea, glucose, and thiourea as fuels. On the other hand, Chen et al.
reported detailed investigations on the synthesis of W18O49 nano-
rods (Fig. 23g) utilizing reactive solutions of ammonium paratung-
state and ammonium nitrate with different fuels [120,147,148].
They showed that the most important parameters for tuning the
composition and morphology of the products are fuel type and
quantity in the initial reactive solution. The authors surmised that a
significant amount of glycine in the reactive solution could trigger
dehydration polymerization of amino and carboxy groups in the gly-
cine molecules, leading to the formation of a cross-linked network
structure, which facilitates crystal growth along the (010) direction
(Fig. 23h). Reactive solutions containing urea could not generate
one-dimensional structures regardless of the fuel contents. The
authors speculated that urea is unable to form a cross-linked struc-
ture due to polymerization, because it has two amino groups and no
carboxy groups. The utilization of urea together with citric acid,
whose molecule has three carboxy groups, resulted in one-dimen-
sional W18O49 nanorods. This fact supported the authors’ hypothesis
that cross-linked polymerization influences the crystal to grow with
a preferential orientation.

hierarchical nanostructures utilizing zinc nitrate as an oxidizer and

represents

Poxalic acid as the fuel [149]. They indicate that stirring the reactions
solutions for about 0.5 h generated a colloidal solution. Then, the col-
loidal solution was introduced into a furnace preheated to 720 K for
10 min. The flame temperature of combustion process was measured
to be »1570 K. The investigation of the microstructure showed that a
porous ZnO product
self-assembled nanoparticles
(»20 nm) in the form of rods with a diameter of about 100(cid:1)200 nm
and a length of about 1(cid:1)2 mm (Fig. 24). It is interesting to note that
incorporation of iron dopant into the ZnO lattice leads a decrease of
the porous rod aspect ratio. Also, the surfaces of the Fe-doped ZnO
become smooth, and the porosity gradually decreases with
increased dopant. The growth mechanism of these hierarchical
nanorods is unknown. Many works [150(cid:1)155] indicate that regard-
less of the fuel used, the ZnO products represent agglomerates of
randomly assembled isotropic nanoparticles similar to the one
shown in Fig. 20a. We can assume that colloidal nanoparticles
reported in Cai et al. work [149] formed during the preparation stage
may have a significant impact on growing nanorods.

PFew works [156,157] suggest that utilization of urea as a fuel may
significantly change the zinc oxide product morphology. For exam-
ple, S€ollradl et al. reported [157] that the combustion reaction in the
zinc nitrate + urea system is characterized by high temperatures,
in significant grain growth and sintering
which could result

Pprocesses (Fig. 25a). The authors did not provide high-resolution
images to understand individual particle structure. It is also unclear
whether the large ZnO particles with pyramidal shapes are nano-
crystals or aggregates of much smaller nanocrystals. It is interesting
that adding nickel nitrate to reactive solutions may change the mor-
phology of the urea-derived ZnO [158]. For example, a small amount
of Ni dopant forms thin nano-flakes on the surface of ZnO crystals
(Fig. 25b).

PThe dopant effect on the combustion product microstructure can
be demonstrated by the Co-doped SnO2 synthesis reported by Babu
and co-authors [159]. They initiated combustion on solutions con-
taining tin chloride, urea, and cobalt nitrate hexahydrate in a pre-
heated (720 K) furnace. The cobalt nitrate concentration in the solu-
tions was selected to obtain 0.01 (sample Co-1), 0.03 (Co-3) and 0.05
(Co-5) mol% Co in the final products. XRD patterns of pure and Co-
doped SnO2 nanomaterials demonstrated only diffraction peaks of
the tetragonal SnO2 structure. TEM images of the reaction products
(Fig. 26a) indicate that the cobalt content influences the resulting
product dimensionality.

PThe pure SnO2 exhibited flaky morphology, while the increased
Co content first favors nanorod formation and then spherical nano-
particles. Such significant morphological
transformations were
achieved only by doping with small amounts of Co impurity. The

Pauthors, however, did not explain the possible mechanism that
could lead to these changes. On the other hand, UV-visible spectros-
copy (Fig. 26b) showed that the absorption edge of nanomaterials
shifts to upper wavelengths and the energy bandgap decreased from
»3.15 to 2.6 eV with increased Co concentration. The authors attrib-
uted the observed absorption band shifts to a special band of d(cid:1)d
transitions of Co2 + ions in octahedral site symmetry.

PAnother interesting example of manipulation over the SCS prod-
uct microstructure is the synthesis of Sr-doped calcium hydroxyapa-
tite. Sr addition helps modify the morphology and the lattice
parameter of the products. Kavitha et al. showed that increasing the
Sr content to 30% leads increased doped calcium hydroxyapatite
crystal sizes [160]. The dopant quantity also leads a significantly
increased nanocrystal aspect ratio, making it possible to produce
nanorods.

PAn interesting strategy that combines reactive solution with
microwave heating and molten salt (e.g. NaNO3) has enabled the
development of a significant number of phosphate bioceramics,
such as hydroxyapatite, fluorapatite, and chlorapatite, with aniso-
tropic morphology [161(cid:1)164]. Fig. 27 shows fluorapatite nanowires
formed by this technique [163].

PIt can be seen that many nanowires grew from one nucleation
center. Microwave irradiation ensures uniform heating of the reac-
tive solutions, while the molten salt dissolves the phosphate precipi-
tates during combustion. These particles serve as nucleation centers
in molten salt during the salt solidification when the bioceramic
phase rapidly crystallizes along the preferred growth axis, resulting
in nanotubes or nanorods.

PRecently Wen and co-authors reported low-temperature com-
bustion (rapid pyrolysis) for the preparation of anatase nanobelts
[164]. The initial solutions contained titanium oxysulfate (TiOSO4),
an excessive amount of glycine, and nitric acid, which were then
immersed into a preheated furnace (670 K) to obtain mixtures of an
amorphous metal complex with organic residues (Fig. 28a). Room
temperature treatment of
the amorphous product with H2O2
resulted in the removal of the organic compounds and the formation
of a hydrogen titanate hydrate (H2TiO5 ¢ H2O) composed of nanobelts
with a thickness of »1 nm. Low temperature (350 °C) calcination of
hydrogen titanate formed anatase nanobelts (Fig. 28b, c). The ultra-
thin nanobelts demonstrate outstanding performance for lithium
storage because of the unique nanoarchitecture and appropriate
composition. Fig. 28d shows that the ultrathin anatase nanobelts
deliver a variable discharge capacity at current rates from 0.5 C to 30
C. It should be noted that, when the current returns to 0.5 C, the
ultrathin nanobelts resume the 204 mAhg¡1 capacity after 80 cycles,
indicating excellent rate performance and good cycling performance.
Wen and co-authors also report similar electrochemical characteris-
tics for a commercial anatase (P25) with high surface area, which
displays much lower charge/discharge capacity than the ultrathin
anatase nanobelts (Fig. 28d). The authors noted that the high electro-
chemical activity and low preparation cost makes the ultrathin TiO2
a promising anode material for high-performance and safe lithium
ion batteries.

PNickel doped anatase nanobelts were also synthesized using the
same approach by utilizing reactive solutions containing titanium
oxysulfate, glycine, nickel nitrate, and nitric acid [165]. TEM and
EDS analysis indicate that nickel was uniformly distributed onto
ultrathin TiO2 nanobelts. It was also shown that the addition of
nickel nitrate into the reactive solution did not alter the nanobelt

3.2 eV to 2.9 eV. It is evident that low-temperature combustion of
glycine-rich initial solutions forms a self-assembled metal com-
pound within amorphous carbon-rich byproduct formed during
pyrolysis of glycine. Chemical purification of these intermediates
reveal hydrogen titanate with nanobelt architectures. Upon mild
heat treatment, the titanate transformed into anatase-based two-
dimensional nanostructures.

3.5. Spray combustion synthesis of spherical particles

PSpraying reactive solutions into a preheated tube furnace enables
the preparation of a large variety of spherical nano- and miro-par-
ticles [166(cid:1)172]. For example, Xu et al. reported on the synthesis of
mesoporous Fe2O3 spherical particles by atomizing an iron nitrate
and sucrose solution [168]. The authors showed that, at low furnace
temperatures (870 K), amorphous Fe2O3 spheres form as the reaction

Pproduct, while at 870 K highly crystalline spherical nanoparticles can
be produced. Nitrogen absorption measurements suggest that the
BET specific surface area for amorphous and crystalline iron oxide
spheres is 23 and 58 m2/g, respectively. TEM analysis confirms the
mesoporous nature of Fe2O3 nanoparticles (Fig. 29a, b).

PThe lighter regions represent pores, while the darker areas are
Fe2O3 walls. High-resolution TEM analysis suggests that the pore
size is 10 nm for both materials. The electrochemical characteriza-
tion for lithium ion battery anodes showed that spherical crystalline
Fe2O3 particles exhibited a high reversible capacity of 800 mAh/g at
0.5 C over 300 charge/discharge cycles and retained 300 mAh/g at
10 C. The authors attributed this remarkable stability to the internal
open pores in the Fe2O3 particles that provide enough space
to accommodate the volume change during the charge/discharge
processes.

PShih and co-authors sprayed solutions of cerium ammonium
nitrate and glycine into small droplets while an air flow with
controlled rate carried the droplets into a tube furnace with three
heating zones of 520, 920 and 620 K [173]. Detailed microscopic
examination showed that, depending on glycine to nitrate ratio in
the initial solutions, the product particles show four distinct mor-
phologies; solid spheres, hollow spheres, flakes and porous flakes.
The solution of pure cerium ammonium nitrate yields solid spheres,
while glycine-rich solutions resulted in porous flakes. The solutions,
closer to the stoichiometric reactant composition form primarily
hollow shapes with some solid spheres and thin flakes.

PTrusov et al reported [111] a spray solution combustion synthesis
method for production of hollow spherical metallic (Cu or Ni) nano-
structured particles. The average diameter of these spheres ranges
from 0.5 to 5 mm with wall thickness of »20 (cid:1) 50 nm (Fig. 29c, d).
The furnace temperature, reactive solution composition, gas envi-
ronment, and flow rate are shown to be main parameters that define
the phase composition of the produced microspheres. By varying
these parameters, pure metals, oxides (NiO, Cu2O), or mixtures could
be prepared.

3.6. Thin films

PDuring the previous few years, a novel SCS-based method has
been reported for the production of thin films for electronic devi-
ces, solar cells, and light-emitting diodes [174(cid:1)182]. This method
involves deposition of a reactive solution on a substrate by spin
coating or spraying techniques, followed by a short heat treatment
at 420-570 K [174,183]. The reaction of thin precursor layers produ-
ces a uniform oxide film. Depending on the materials and process
condition, both amorphous and crystalline films may be produced.
For example, Wang and co-authors recently prepared [174] all-
oxide, transparent thin film transistors consisting of high capaci-
tance ZrO2 or Al2O3 amorphous dielectric layers, high conductivity
indium tin oxide (ITO), semiconducting indium zinc oxide (IZO),
and indium gallium zinc oxide IGZO channel layers (Fig. 30a). Pore-
free layers with uniform thickness prepared at low annealing tem-
peratures ensured high quality and excellent reliability of the thin
film transistors.

PRecent reports also suggest that the combustion-derived thin
films may be used as active charge transports layer in new solar

Pcells. For example, Liu et al. used acetylacetonate (AcAc) and urea
fuel mixtures to prepare tin oxide electron-transporting thin layers
for organic-inorganic perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3) solar cells [184]. It
was shown that the use of dual fuels allows tailoring of the heat
release characteristics during the combustion reaction, and results
in crystalline, homogeneous, and transparent SnO2 films at lower
ignition temperature (»420 K). More importantly, SnO2 films pre-
pared by the mixed fuel approach exhibit better charge-collecting
capability from the perovskite absorber layer, as shown by the pho-
toluminescence quenching of perovskite and SnO2/perovskite films
(Fig. 30b).

PZhao et al. [181] showed that multiple cycles of deposition and
combustion allow for obtaining thicker (several micrometers) films
of doped complex oxide-based luminescent films with strong
absorption in the ultraviolet-light and blue-light range, and consid-
erable photoluminescence emission peak centered at 551 nm with a
good quantum yield.

4. Gas-phase flame synthesis (FS) of 1D nanostructured thin films

4.1. Background

PFS has been successfully utilized for production of nanoparticles;
this approach has been well
reviewed by several groups
[10,185(cid:1)187]. Recently, nanostructured thin films grown by FS have
also gained increasing interest. Thin films composed of nanoparticles
were fabricated extensively for devices [188(cid:1)199], especially for gas
sensors [197(cid:1)199]. Li et al. [187] have made a remarkable review
recently published in PECS, which summarized the recent advances
in flame aerosol synthesis of nanostructured materials, including
processing, modeling and diagnostics. They explain nanostructured
materials mainly in the form of nanoparticles and the fabrication of
nanoparticle structured thin films and devices by flame aerosol
deposition comprehensively. In this section, instead, we put our
focus on flame synthesized nanostructured thin films, where nano-
structures are aligned in 1D and grown on substrates. The growth
mechanisms and applications of these 1D nanostructured thin films
are also discussed. In the early stage of 1D metal oxide nanostructure
growth, a metal probe was the precursor and the substrate was
placed into the flame, which was oxidized to generate metal oxide
vapors that subsequently condensed onto the probe surface, forming
crystalline metal oxide NWs [200(cid:1)202]. These seminal studies have
shown that FS is an atmospheric, fast, and catalyst-free approach for
1D metal oxide nanostructured thin film growth. However, since the
same materials are used as both a source for vapor generation and a
site for vapor condensation, the substrate choices and potential
applications of these metal oxide NWs are limited. Significant effort

Phas been made to explore FS 1D nanostructured on distinct sub-
strates, especially, on transparent conductive substrate for broader
potential uses. Great progress has been made, including develop-
ment of the FS system (e.g. flame reactor, precursor feeding system,
temperature controlling system, etc.), chemical species of 1D nano-
structures, nanostructure morphological development, their growth
mechanisms, as well as the applications of the synthesized thin
films.

PConsidering desirable thin film chemical compositions, solid
metal can be used as a precursor for metal oxides (e.g. iron oxide,
zinc oxide, tungsten oxide, molybdenum oxide etc.). In particular,
the processes for growth of tungsten oxide nanostructured thin films
are discussed. Besides, a liquid solution can also be utilized as a pre-
cursor for the growth of metal oxide nanostructures. The broader
selection of liquid precursor offers possibilities for synthesizing
more metal oxide compositions and more complex thin films (e.g.
doped materials). In addition, we also provide insight into fabrica-
tion of hybrid nanostructured thin films by combining FS with other
methods, and techniques using flame as post treatment process,
including sol-flame synthesis and flame reduction method. In addi-
tion, the growth mechanisms of nanostructured thin films by FS are
summarized below and tungsten oxide (W18O49) is taken as an
example. Finally, the potential applications of 1D nanostructured
metal oxide thin films, typically, for photoelectrochemical (PEC)
water splitting and lithium ion battery were introduced in the last
section.

4.2. 1D nanostructured thin films by FS processes

PFlame vapor deposition (FVD) is capable of producing 1D metal
oxide nanowires without using any metal catalysts. This method is
attractive for the synthesis of nanostructured thin film growth,
because it not only produces thin film with high purity and crystal-
linity, but also offers a fast fabrication rate resulting from high pre-
cursor concentration through the high flame temperature zone.
Additionally, this method also has the advantage of continuous pro-
duction and scalability. In the early stage of 1D metal oxide nanoma-
terial growth using the FVD process, it was explored using a metal
probe as precursor and substrate, which was oxidized in the flame
to generate metal oxide vapors which were subsequently condensed
onto the surface of the same metal substrate forming crystalline
metal oxide NWs. Specifically, Tse's group [203] first reported WO2.9
NW growth with diameters of 20-50 nm and growth rates higher
than 1 mm/min by oxidizing tungsten in a counter flow diffusion
flame. A variety of ZnO NWs [203]were later grown directly on a
zinc probe by oxidizing zinc in a co-flow jet diffusion flame at vari-
[201] synthesized highly
ous axial positions. Merchan et al.

Pcrystalline Fe3O4 nanorods by oxidizing an iron probe in an opposed-
flow methane oxy-flame. In all of the mentioned cases, the NWs
were grown through the vapor- solid growth mechanism. These
studies demonstrated that FS is an effective and catalyst-free route
for the growth of 1D metal oxide nanostructures. Given that the
source of vapor generation and the site for deposition are in the
same material, interest has been turned to deposit thin films on sub-
strate of different material. In particular, metal oxide NWs grown on
conductive substrates and/or with large surface area are highly
desirable for various applications.

PZheng and co-workers have pioneered the development of 1D
metal oxide nanostructured thin film growth on diverse substrates,
such as W18O49 NWs and NTs [202,204], a-MoO3 nanobelts [205],
g-Fe2O3 NWs [206], Mo17O47 NWs [207], and 1D complex metal
oxides including W-doped MoO3 nanoplates. Cu3Mo2O9 NWs, hier-
archical CuO/MoO3 core/shell NWs, and MoO3-branched CuO NWs
[208] were also successfully fabricated from this group; some nano-
structures are shown in Fig. 31. Fig. 32 shows the schematics of sev-
eral FVD setups for various metal oxide growth. Typically, for
W18O49 NW growth, a tungsten wire mesh, located in the oxygen-
deficient flame, was oxidized to generate tungsten oxide vapor
which was subsequently deposited onto the substrate in the down-
stream, forming NW structured W18O49 thin films. These W18O49
NWs with high aspect ratio could be oxidized to by post-annealing
treatment. In their earlier work [202], a co-flow multi-element diffu-
sion burner (Hencken burner) was utilized as shown in Fig. 32a. In
this design, the cooling meshes inserted between the W mesh and
substrate were used to control the temperature of the W source
mesh and substrate temperature, which inevitably caused a signifi-
cant amount of WOx vapor depositing onto the cooling meshes. Con-
sequently, dense and uniform NWs could not be obtained at low
substrate temperatures. In order to utilize these NW structured thin
films for PEC water splitting, a transparent conductive glass sub-
strate is required. NWs grown at low substrate temperature is essen-
tial because the common conductive substrate (e.g. fluorinated tin
oxide coated glass) could not resist the high flame temperature.
They later improved the FVD system using a flat premixed flame
(Mckenna burner) and employing a water-cooled plate to control
the substrate temperature [204] as shown in Fig. 32b. Substrate tem-
perature could be effectively controlled. The morphology changed
from multi-shell nanotube (NT) and single-shell NT to NW arrays by

Pincreasing the substrate temperature in the range of 800-970 K. It is
suggested that the substrate temperature has great impact on nucle-
ation process and axial growth rate of the nanostructures, which
leads to the formation of different morphologies. The WO3 NTs with
higher area number density and longer length was reported to
exhibit good PEC water-splitting performance. Later, Ding and Kim
[209] developed a FVD system by incorporating a steady tungsten
wire feeder into the designed flame reactor. This system guaranteed
constant vapor concentration during thin film deposition. Vertically-
aligned multiple tungsten oxide nanostructures including NW, NT,
multi-NT, and bush-like WOx structures could be obtained while
increasing the wire feed rate. The NW-based WO3 with an optimum
thickness of about 7.2 mm was found to exhibit superior PEC per-
formances to those of reported nanostructured WO3 photoanodes.

PApart from solid metal precursors, a liquid solution can also be
utilized as a precursor in flame deposition process. The broader
selection of liquid precursors offers possibilities of synthesizing
many metal oxide species and complex thin films. In general, a liquid
precursor (diluted if necessary) is introduced into the flame torch in
the form of vapor or liquid by bubbler or aerosol generator (com-
monly, nebulizer or atomizer), which will be pyrolyzed at a high
flame temperature to generate metal oxide vapors or particles. These
species are subsequently deposited onto the substrate to form metal
oxide thin films. A variety of nanopowder metal oxide thin films
have been synthesized such as NiO-YSZ (yttria-stabilized zirconia)
[188], LiCoO2 [189], Sn/SnO2 composite [190], Gd-doped CeO2 [191],
SiO2 [192,193], TiO2 [195,210], C-doped TiO2 [196] and Pt-SnO2/Pd-
SnO2 [197,198]. These nanoparticle structured thin films and some
of their applications have been well reviewed elsewhere [187]. It's
worth mentioning that a variety of products including binary oxide,
doped metal oxide and composite material could be synthesized by
flame spray pyrolysis.

PDespite many studies on liquid precursor FS for metal oxide thin
films, there are a few reports about 1D nanostructured thin films
directly grown on substrates by this process. Antonio et al. [211]
have prepared SiO2 NWs grown on a glass substrate and Kim's
[194] and Biswas's [212] groups have synthesized vertically aligned
columnar structured TiO2 thin film grown on conductive FTO-
coated glass substrate. The schematic of flame aerosol deposition
system and columnar and granular nanostructured TiO2 thin films
were presented in Fig. 33. The volatile liquid precursor (titanium

Ptetra-isopropoxide) was introduced to methane flame to generate
TiO2 particles and deposited onto substrate in the form of vertically
aligned structures at certain conditions. Liquid precursors can offer
diverse choices for a specific product formation and a variety of
possible products. However, 1D nanostructured thin films by FS
using liquid precursors are scarcely studied and more attention
should be paid to this research.

4.3. 1D nanostructured thin films by FS combined with other processes

P1D heterostructures have received significant attention due to
their potential ability to enhance physical and/or chemical proper-
ties, by counterbalancing the weaknesses of individual component
and utilizing both intrinsic advantages. These nanostructures can be
produced in either a single or multiple synthetic processes. Since the
FVD process has demonstrated the capability of rapid 1D metal oxide
it could be employed for 1D base structure synthesis.
growth,

PHeterostructures can thereby be accomplished in combination with
other processes. Dong and co-workers [213] have combined FS and
electrodeposition processes for NW structured tungsten oxide/alu-
minum thermite nanocomposite growth. These nanocomposites are
comprised of an array of WO2.9 NW core with diameter of 20-50 nm
synthesized by FVD process and single crystal aluminum shells with
thickness of about 16 nm by electrodeposition. Later, they decorated
flame-synthesized WO2.9 NWs with zinc/tin-oxide nanostructures
[214] by a solution synthesis approach (Fig. 34). In this study, flame
synthesized WO2.9 NWs provided active nucleation sites for hetero-
geneous nuclei formation or continuous growth sites in the second
solution synthesis process; SnO2, ZnO, and Zn2SnO4 were success-
fully grown on WO2.9 NWs in the form of nanoparticles, nanoplates
and nanocubes, respectively, as shown in Fig. 34. It is reported that
the morphologies of heterostructures with multiple components
rely on the process duration and precursor concentration. Zheng and
co-workers [215,216] have reported the fabrication of WO3/BiVO4

Pcore /shell heterojunction NW-structured thin films by combining FS
with drop-casting method, which exhibits superior performance for
PEC water splitting. WO3 NW thin films were successfully synthesized
in a FVD process after post-annealing. They coated Bi & V precursors
by drop-casting onto the as-grown WO3 NW thin films, followed by
post-annealing to obtain WO3/BiVO4 core/shell structures. The long
range WO3 cores provide not only a large surface area for BiVO4
(main light absorber) coating but also the direct pathways for photo-
electrons transport to reach the back contact. This WO3/BiVO4 thin
film generates a current density of 3.1 mA/cm2 even without an oxy-
gen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst under simulated solar light at a
potential of 1.23 V vs. RHE. By further hydrothermal deposition of
OER catalysts of Ni:FeOOH on WO3/BiVO4 photoanode [216], a
charge-transfer efficiency of 91% at 1.23 V vs. RHE was achieved.

PThe high-temperature flame offers high heating rates resulted
from strong convective and radiative heat transfers. This advantage
has been utilized in 1D nanostructure growth. Rao has reported the

Pgrowth of a-Fe2O3 nanoflakes and CuO nanoneedle arrays [217] in a
multi-element coflow diffusion flat-flame. In this work, a metal sub-
strate was placed into the post flame low-temperature region and
metal oxide nanostructures were grown via the solid diffusion
mechanism. The large heating rate from the flame causes the forma-
tion of thin and coarse oxide layers, which facilitate the rapid diffu-
sion of metal, significantly contributing to the fast growth rate. The
high-temperature flame can also be utilized as an auxiliary tool for
1D nanostructure growth. A sol-flame synthesis is a novel approach
for hybrid metal oxide growth [218(cid:1)222]. 1D structures were first
prepared by another method, e.g., hydrothermal method followed
by sol-gel process for nanoparticle or dopant precursor coating onto
the prepared 1D nanostructures. These precursors could be dissoci-
ated/oxidized in the flame either forming nanoparticle decorated
NWs (NP@NWs) or doped ones, as illustrated in Fig. 35. Sol(cid:1)gel pro-
cess offers broad material choices and possible control of chemical
composition. The high-temperature flame process provides high

Pheating rates. By this combined sol-flame method, Zheng's group has
successfully synthesized a variety of NP@NWs and doped NWs such
as ZnO@CuO [218], Co3O4@CuO [220], W-doped TiO2 [219], Co3O4@-
CuO [221] and Co-doped TiO2 NWs [222].

PAnother flame-assisted technique is the flame reduction method,
which also utilizes the unique advantages of fast heating rate owing
to high flame temperature and tunable reducing environment in fuel
rich conditions. Cho and co-workers have reported that flame reduc-
tion enables to generate oxygen vacancies in as-grown 1D structured
thin films such as TiO2 NWs [223] and NTs [224]. The amounts of
these oxygen vacancies could be tunable. As-grown 1D nanostruc-
tured thin films were inserted into the post-flame region of the co-
flow methane-air premixed flame. In fuel-rich conditions, there
were high concentrations of CO and H2, which provided a reducing
environment, as shown in Fig. 36. This technique is a facile and effec-
tive approach to create oxygen vacancies in metal oxides, while pre-
serving the morphology and crystallinity of nanostructures. It was
reported that the saturation photocurrent densities of these thin
films applied for solar water splitting applications was greatly
improved.

4.4. Growth mechanism of flame synthesized 1D nanostructures

PCurrently, 1D NWs grown in the gas phase are primarily based on
two mechanisms, vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) and vapor-solid (VS)
mechanisms [225]. The VLS mechanism [226,227] relies on nano-
sized catalytic liquid metal (e.g., Au, Ni) for nucleation and growth
via the supersaturation-precipitation process. During VLS growth
process, the metal catalyst can react with the target structures at

Phigh temperatures, which creates contamination because of the for-
mation of intermetallic compounds [228]. In the absence of catalysts,
nanowires can grow on the substrate through a VS mechanism
[229,230]. The spontaneous catalyst-free nanowire growth can be
driven by anisotropic surface energy of various facets [225], screw
dislocation [231], planar stacking fault [232], or assisted by oxides
[233]. Although the NW growth dynamics and kinetics still remain
elusive, owing to a lack of crucial information related to growth
dynamics at the atomic level, many materials have been made
through this mechanism in flame vapor deposition synthesis, partic-
ularly, for metal oxide NWs discussed earlier including WO2.9 NWs
[203] and ZnO NWs [200] by Tse's group and W18O49 NWs
[202,204], g-Fe2O3 NWs[206], and Mo17O47 NWs [207] from Zheng’
group. Significant efforts have been spent to improve understanding
of the vapor-solid growth mechanism, typically, for W18O49 NW
growth [202,207,209,230,233]. W18O49 NWs were found to grow in
the [010] direction, perpendicular to their close-packed (010) places
[202,230]. Zheng [202] suggested that
the sub-stoichiometric
W18O49 has an intrinsic anisotropic property, leading to 1D structure
growth. Also, the vapor adsorption rate at the as-grown NW tip
exceeds the defect-free NW sides, thus enhancing the NW aspect
ratio. Zhang and coworkers [230] have recently reported real-time
atomic-scale observations of the W18O49 NW growth through an
environmental TEM. They found that the (010) close-packed plane of
W18O49 has higher surface energy than the low-index planes (001),
(100), and (101). Therefore, the anisotropic surface energies explain
the anisotropic structure of the W18O49 NWs in terms of growth
kinetics at the atomic level. Ding and Kim [209] has successfully syn-
thesized sub-stoichiometric WOx NWs and NTs thin films in a FVD

as shown in Fig. 37. At low fluxes of WOx vapor, small nuclei could
be formed in the beginning stage and NW structures tend to form.
By diffusion, the vapors prefer to deposit onto as-existed NWs

Pleading to long-range axial growth. In contrast, larger nuclei could
be formed at medium WOx vapor fluxes. It is suggested that the
growth rate is faster on the outer shell of the large as-grown nano-
structure than on the central part due to the higher flux of incoming
vapors diffused in from outside region. This leads to NT growth. By
further increasing the feed rate, multi-tube structures could be

Pdeveloped. The high nuclei formation rate during primary structure
growth and the growth of newly nucleated sites in the axial and
lateral direction around the primary structures lead to several
layers wrapping around the primary structure, forming multi-
tube structures.

PIn addition, Biswas and co-workers [212] fabricated columnar
and granular nanostructured TiO2 thin films on a conductive FTO-
coated glass substrate from liquid precursors. The vapor phase pre-
cursor was introduced into the flame. They suggested that the thin
film morphology relied on the various flame deposition process
characteristic times, including precursor vapor residence time, pre-
cursor chemical reaction time, sintering time, and collision time
[234]. When the reaction time is far larger than residence time, the
vapor can only react after depositing on the substrate and this leads
to the formation of a dense film. When the reaction time is much
shorter than the residence time, particles would be formed before
reaching to the substrate, which is attributed to the formation of
highly-porous granular film. However, when the reaction and resi-
dence times were at similar magnitudes, mixed vapor and small par-
ticles deposited onto the substrate, resulting in the growth of
columnar structured films. Granular structured thin films were
formed when the particles were dominant in the gas phase before
reaching to the substrate, columnar and granular thin films are as
presented in Fig. 33.

PFS is a rapid, simple, scalable and catalyst-free technique for
metal oxide growth. Better understanding of the growth mechanism
is essential for designing and controlling nanostructure growth.
Thus, more effort is required to understand the growth mechanism
for flame synthesized 1D nanostructures grown on the substrate.

4.5. Applications of functional 1D nanostructured thin films by FS

P1D metal oxide and/or hybrid nanostructured thin films with
large surface-to-volume ratio have drawn considerable attention
because of their unique optical, electrochemical properties for their
potential use in various applications such as photoelectrochemical
(PEC) water splitting [204,215,219,222(cid:1)224,235], lithium-ion bat-
tery [236(cid:1)238], solar cell [212], gas sensor [239(cid:1)242] and so on.
Here, two typical applications including PEC water splitting and

Plithium ion battery was introduced. FS technique for 1D nanostruc-
tured thin films has gained increasing interest in the past decade.
The applications for flame synthesized 1D nanostructured thin films
remain a topic of active researches in future.

P4.5.1. 1D nanostructured thin films for PEC water splitting

PPEC water splitting is emerging as a promising route for solar
hydrogen generation and has attracted increasing interest in both
scientific and industrial communities [243]. 1D nanostructured
semiconductor materials have drawn great attention for PEC water
splitting. This is because 1D nanostructures orthogonalize the direc-
tion of electron transport and light absorption along the long axis
and direction of hole transport across the short radius, which facili-
tates light absorption and charge carrier collection. Besides, 1D
nanostructures also provide large interfacial contact area at the
semiconductor/electrolyte interface for oxygen evolution reaction.
Many metal oxides such as BiVO4, WO3, Fe2O3, TiO2, etc. have been
used as photoanodes for PEC water splitting. Biswas and co-workers
[212] fabricated columnar and granular nanostructured TiO2 thin
films grown on a conductive FTO-coated glass substrate by FS. Their
performances for PEC water splitting were evaluated. Thin films
with columnar morphology showed better performances than those
with granular morphology, achieving a UV-light to hydrogen conver-
sion efficiency of 11% for water splitting. Ding and Kim [235] fabri-
cated WO3 1D NW structured thin films by FVD process for PEC
water splitting. The best performing WO3 NW structured photoa-
node with an optimal thickness of 7.2 mm exhibited superior per-
formances to other previously reported WO3 photoanodes which
were fabricated by other methods. Besides, the fast fabrication rate
by FS makes it attractive for 1D nanostructured thin film growth. To
enhance the PEC water splitting efficiency, many researchers
attempted to constructing hybrid heterojunctional structures in
order to counterbalance the shortages and utilize the advantages of
the individual components, such as WO3/BiVO4 [215,216,244(cid:1)246],
CdS/TiO2 [247], ZnO/CuO [248], ZnO/TiO2 [249], and ZnO/BiVO4
[250]. Rao et al. [215] have fabricated a WO3/BiVO4 core/shell
NW-structured photoanode by combining flame vapor deposition
for WO3 NW growth and drop-casting for the BiVO4 coating, as pre-
sented in Fig. 38, where BiVO4 is the primary light-absorber and

PWO3 acted as the electron conductor. These core/shell nanowires
achieved simultaneous enhanced light absorption and charge sepa-
ration, producing a photocurrent of 3.1 mA/cm2 even without an
OER catalyst loading under simulated sunlight. These results dem-
onstrate that high-performing WO3/BiVO4 NWs could be synthe-
sized in an inexpensive and scalable FVD combined processes.
Later, Cai et al. [216] deposited an ultrathin oxygen evolution cata-
lyst (Ni-doped FeOOH) onto the mentioned WO3/BiVO4 NW-struc-
tured photoanodes by a hydrothermal process. The coated Ni:
FeOOH lowered the onset potential of WO3/BiVO4 photoanodes and
enhanced PEC water splitting performance by achieving a photo-
current density of 4.5 mA/cm2. This illustrates the potential for
WO3/BiVO4-based photoanodes for efficient PEC water splitting.
Thus, constructing specific nanostructures plays a critical role in
further optimization. The FVD process has demonstrated a promis-
ing route for WO3 NW growth.

P4.5.2. 1D nanostructured thin films for lithium ion battery

PRechargeable lithium ion batteries have garnered significant
interest not only for portable devices [251], but also especially for
hybrid electric vehicles as well as clean energy storage due to their
high energy capacity, long cycle life and lifespan [252]. Electrode
materials, which are safe, nontoxic and high rate capable, are highly
desirable [253]. Metal oxides present high potential to be used as
anode materials [254], however, they suffer from capacity fading
during cycling caused by poor kinetics and significant volume
expansion in the lithium intercalation/deintercalation processes. 1D
NWs can provide superior conduction pathways for charge transport
and shorter paths (radial distance) for fast lithium ion diffusion.
Moreover, NWs offer high electrode¡electrolyte contact area and
good strain accommodation [252]. All these results in an enhanced
power performance. Recently, Co3O4 NWs [237], coaxial SnO2/In2O3
heterostructured NWs [236], and MoO3-x NWs [238] have demon-
strated high-capacity retention with low capacity fading. Meduri
and coworkers [238] have synthesized single crystalline MoO3-x
NWs grown on metallic and conducting substrates in a hot-filament
chemical vapor deposition reactor. The electrodes made of MoO3(cid:1)x
NWs with diameters of about 90 nm exhibit a high capacity reten-
tion of 630 mAhg(cid:1)1 for up to 20 cycles at a 50 mAg(cid:1)1 current density,
as shown in Fig. 39 (the theoretical capacity of the most widely used
graphite anode is 372 mAhg(cid:1)1 [255]). Additionally, hybrid core/shell
Si/MoO3(cid:1)x architectures were also attempted in their research.
10 nm Si-coated MoO3(cid:1)x nanowire arrays showed a capacity reten-
tion of »780 mAhg(cid:1)1, indicating that hybrid materials are desirable
for the next generation materials for lithium ion batteries.

PAs we mentioned earlier, FS has been proved to be capable of
growing MoO3-x NWs [207] and other metal oxides on metallic sub-
strates with high aspect ratio. This process holds many advantages

Pof rapid growth rates, low cost and large-scale capability. It can be a
promising route for the growth of 1D nanostructured MoO3-x and
other metal oxides with optimized diameters via adjustment of pro-
cess variables, which need to be further, developed.

5. Conclusions and perspectives

PCombustion synthesis, in the past two decades, has not only
proven to be one of the most scalable and economical technologies
for producing inorganic oxide and non-oxide (carbide, nitride,
boride, etc.) nanostructured ceramic materials (covering most ele-
ments in the periodic table), but also has been demonstrated to be a
robust fabrication method of a single and few atomic layer nano-
sheets, functional thin films and nano-devices. Unlike the FS tech-
nique, where the type of burner is critical for the characteristics of
the powder, the combustion chamber for SP-CS reactions has a stan-
dard design and doesn't significantly affect the final powder charac-
teristics. The main factor for the synthesis of nanomaterials in SP-CS
is the initial mixture composition. By varying the precursor materi-
als and their concentration we may significantly increase (or
decrease) the combustion temperature and change the final powder
characteristics. Also, application of different types of additives dur-
ing combustion may drastically change the reaction pathway and
create favorable conditions for nanostructures formation. The vari-
ous mixtures are described and the characteristics of nanostructures
versus combustion parameters are summarized and compared. The
metal oxide-magnesium mixture, diluted with inorganic salts, had
been widely used for 0D nanoparticle synthesis, whereas metathesis
reactions with metal salt precursors are excellent tools for producing
1D, 2D, and 3D hierarchical nanostructures. SP-CS synthesis has
shown its advantages for the production of refractory metal nano-
materials and metal-based compounds, covering nearly all of the
elements from the III-VI groups in the periodic table. Control over
the mixture composition is a suitable approach for precisely produc-
ing ultrafine nanoparticles, as well as fabricating various kinds of 0D,
1D, 2D, and 3D hierarchical nanostructures.

PProgress on refractory metal, non-metal, carbide, and nitride
nanostructures synthesis are reviewed from the standpoint of nano-
composite morphological structures and phase-purity. The following
key factors were taken into account when designing combustion
reactions: (1) the combustion temperature, (2) the precursor mate-
rial physical properties, including melting and boiling points, and (3)
the amount and physical properties of additives used in the experi-
ments. In the case of carbon nanomaterials, practical tests in device
composition were also conducted. On the basis of carbon nanostruc-
ture combustion synthesis with different dimensions, investigations
are on the way. Samples are in practical testing stages in electronic
device compositions.

PAs for diagnoses of combustion synthesis processes (tempera-
tures and wave velocities), in situ methods based on thermocouple
measurement technique are applied. The application of thermocou-
ple techniques is old, but from the prospective of in situ on-line diag-
noses of combustion synthesis, it can meet the needs of simple and
complex hierarchical nanostructures. Moreover, small diameter
thermocouples (10-50 mm) are able to detect the melting and boil-
ing processes on the temperature-time profiles. This makes it a
promising way to understand the physical-chemical complexities
involved in the combustion wave at different levels. In general, a
temperature-time analysis, i.e., calculation of characteristics times
in the combustion wave, and examination of quasi-isothermal sec-
tors on temperature profiles is very helpful for understanding the
whole system and identifying the most important mechanism(s).
Despite the fruitful development of nanomaterial combustion syn-
thesis in the past 10-15 years, the challenges, and more appropri-
than simple
ately,
demonstrations of combustion synthesis to produce single- or
multi-component functional materials of elements in the periodic
table, more attention should be paid to physicochemical and
mechanical characteristics of nanostructures, which is very impor-
tant for their future practical applications. Moreover, clarification of
physicochemical characteristics of nanomaterials can trigger further
improvement of these characteristics and accelerate the practical
application of nanomaterials. Looking back to the research needs/
challenges given in the introduction, prospective work in SP-CS syn-
thesis lies in the following aspects accordingly:

the opportunities are still huge. Rather

P(cid:4) Building theoretical models for predicting the size and shape of
nanoparticles based on the existing experimental data. The
model should be based on the following parameters; combus-
tion temperature and pressure, the physicochemical characteris-
tics of precursor materials (melting, boiling and decomposition
temperatures), the physicochemical characteristics of additives,
the grow rate of individual nanoparticles versus the combustion
temperature, etc. Basically, this type of the model is needed to
overcome challenges during synthesis and selectively, to pro-
duce nanostructures with desired shape and dimensions. Specif-
ically,

for

P(cid:4) Generally, the temperature gradient in a burning sample is
directed from the center to the surface, which leads to non-uni-
form nanoparticle formation during synthesis. Therefore, con-
trolling the morphology and uniformity of nanostructures in the
radial direction of burning samples is one of the topics for fur-
ther investigation. One way to solve this issue is the minimiza-
tion of heat losses from the sample surface leading to quasi-
adiabatic conditions during synthesis. While there are many
physical approaches, the best way to do this is through the
chemical reaction mechanism. At least according to the reported
data, some additives are able to align the temperature distribu-
tion across the sample. Also, the high-temperature nucleation
mechanism, either homogeneous or heterogeneous, of nano-
structures should be studied by utilizing quantum and statistical
mechanics and then validated by modeling the experiments
with advanced quenching technology.

P(cid:4) Test-performance for practical application is an important issue
for the future study. Despite, the existence of a large number of
nanostructures prepared by the SP-CS, the test-performance of
said nanostructures in devices is poor. Only a few materials
were tested for practical application, as described in section 2.5.
Generally, the potential application of SP-CS combustion-made
materials will determine their prospects. In our eyes, these
applications should cut across many fields, aerospace, electron-
ics, military, energy-related areas, with joint interests among

Pcombustion and materials science communities. For example,
tungsten metal nanopowder is useful for military purposes as
kinetic energy penetrators, and for protection from g-radiation.
The batch amount of powders (about 100-200 kg) was already
prepared and tested in the industry for clothing-based protec-
tion from g-radiation. The test-results were promising, how-
ever, more research and development is needed to become
viable for manufacturing. Tantalum metal nanopowder manu-
factured by SP-CS was tested for high CV capacitor applications.
The process is under development. Carbon nanomaterials (hol-
low, mesoporous) were tested for commercial purposes and
future development is needed to improve the powder character-
istics and develop a low-cost and scalable production process.
P(cid:4) Nano-devices based on the SP-CS powder are one of the most
important topics for further investigation. In the current state,
there is no investigation devoted to nano-devices based on
nanostructures produced by SP-CS. Therefore, further research
should also be focusing on the preparation of various types of
nanodevices. Among them, nano-batteries for energy storage,
nano-carriers (including nano-rockets) for drug delivery, and
nano-welding can be designed for the first priority.

P(cid:4) Finally, it must be stated that significant experimental and
empiric understanding has guided the development of solid-
state combustion for nanostructure synthesis. Meanwhile,
developments in modeling, and large-scale production will cre-
ate a solid base for the recognition of SP-CS as a commercially
viable process for the production of nanostructured materials,
from simple 0D to hierarchical 3D complex structures.

PSolution combustion synthesis is the next combustion-based
approach for the preparation of simple and complex oxides, metallic
materials, alloys, composites and sulfides. This method utilizes sim-
ple procedures and affordable reactants to produce nanoscale mate-
rials. The characteristics of SCS-derived materials could be varied by
simple means, such as altering the reactant's ratios, reaction initia-
tion temperature, pH of solutions, etc. The products of the reactions
are nanoscale powders, porous items as well as thin films. One of the
most significant advantages of SCS is related to the easy formation of
high-quality compounds with complex crystal structures. The list of
such materials includes but is not limited to perovskites, garnets,
spinels, silicates, phosphides, etc. SCS also provides simple synthesis
pathways to obtain nanoscale phosphors. Many studies revealed
that the SCS-derived phosphors exhibit the highest structural unifor-
mity of doped elements in the crystal lattice. This feature is related
to the fact that the mixing of the reactants takes place at the molecu-
lar level. In addition, high reaction temperatures enable the forma-
tion of highly crystalline products.

PThe combination of the reactive solution with templates,
spray pyrolysis, the use of microwave heating and molten salts
technology had significantly enhanced the structural diversity of
reaction products. This article demonstrates that SCS allows for
the preparation of uniform non-agglomerated structures such as
nanoparticles, ordered mesoporous materials, nanorods, nano-
whiskers and 2D nanomaterials. It is also important to note that
the solution combustion could be conducted in the continuous
schemes, which can provide nanoscale materials preparation in
the kilogram-scale quantities.

PSCS-derived materials were tested for a vast variety of applica-
tions, which include energy storage and conversion devices (batter-
ies, supercapacitors, solar and solid-oxid fuel cells), optical,
magnetic and electronic devices, catalysts for fuel processing and
emission control technologies. The SCS materials have also received
much attention for light-driven neutralization of toxic chemicals
and biomedical applications. Numerous reports suggest that the
high-quality crystalline materials produced by SCS often outperform
similar products prepared by other methods.

PWe believe, however, that several major issues should be
addressed before the implementation of SCS-based large-scale pro-
duction technology of nanoscale materials.

P(cid:4) One of the most fundamental issues related to the SCS processes
is understanding the chemical mechanisms that are responsible
for combustion reactions. We believe that it is necessary to
develop the arrays of complementary diagnostic techniques,
consisting of molecular and mass spectroscopy as well as
dynamic calorimetry to probe the rapid combustion reactions.
Such novel approaches will permit in-depth understanding of
the mechanisms that govern combustion wave propagation in
aqueous or gel media and will provide valuable insides on the
kinetics of the combustion reactions. These advanced mechanis-
tic investigations will assist in rational optimization of synthesis
conditions.

P(cid:4) Another direction for future efforts is related to exploring addi-
tional means of control over the microstructure of SCS-derived
materials. The application of templates or additives and other
processing techniques has expanded the diversity of product
microstructures. Future works should be directed to understand
whether rapid combustion reactions can be tuned in ways that
will permit control over the growth processes of nanocrystal
without the use of external templates.

P(cid:4) Another main direction of research is related to possible envi-
ronmental impacts of gaseous nitrogen oxides, such as NO2, NO,
N2O, that could form during the large-scale synthesis processes.
The future works should be directed to assess the quantities of
these gases that released during the large-scale synthesis.
Implementation of different formulations can be considered.
One of the approaches could be tuning the fuel to oxidizer ratio
in the reactive solutions. Precise control over this ratio may
reduce nitrogen oxide emissions. The use of mixed fuel approach
could be the other solution to the problem. Large-scale continu-
ous SCS-based production of materials could be coupled with
commercial available selective catalytic reduction systems that
permit reduction of harmful gas emissions by utilization of urea
or ammonia.

PAnd finally, FS has been proved to be an economic, rapid and cat-
alyst-free route for nanostructures growth. To date, a variety of
nanostructured materials including single, or hybrid structures have
been successfully synthesized by this technique. We summarized
the flame deposition processes based on solid metal precursor and
liquid precursor for 1D structured thin films growth. The significant
progresses have been made on the 1D nanostructure growth and
development of flame deposition system including the design of
flame reactor, precursor feeding system and substrate temperature
In particular, McKenna premixed flame
controlling system etc.
burner could ensure the uniformity of thin film grown on large area
attributed to the uniform temperature and flow fields it could offer.
A flame burner incorporated with wire feeder could provide a con-
trollable precursor wire feed rate and guarantee constant vapor con-
centration during thin film deposition. Liquid precursor based flame
deposition process is suitable for fabricating nanostructured thin
films by controlling various processes parameters, which holds the
advantage of a broader selection of chemical species. These may pro-
vide insights into the rational design of flame deposition system and
fabrication of functional thin films. In addition, the fabrication of 1D
based heterostructured nanomaterials could be realized by combin-
ing FS method with other methods. On the one hand, FVD process
capable of rapid 1D metal oxide growth could be employed to build
1D structure base, followed by another facile method (e.g. spin-coat-
ing method) for decoration/modification of 1 structure base. On the
other hand, functional 1D nanostructures could also be obtained by
combining FS with other processes such as sol-flame synthesis and

Pflame reduction process, which utilizes the large heating rate of
high-temperature flame. The morphology development of nano-
structures and their growth mechanisms in flame deposition process
have also been discussed. In the absence of catalyst, 1D NW growth
is believed relying on vapor-solid growth. Although the growth
mechanisms regarding growth dynamic and kinetic of NWs still
remain elusive, many efforts have been made for better understand-
ing vapor-solid growth at the atomic level and physical mass trans-
port perspective.

PDespite recent constructive advances of FS in the past decade, the
future opportunities are still huge. Further attentions should be paid
not only on the fabrication of functional single/complex/hybrid
nanostructured materials but also on understanding the underlying
growth mechanisms of basic nanostructures. Morphology develop-
ment and control in FS need to be further explored by optimizing
the system design and adjusting/modifying the process parameters.
The morphologies including size, diameter, length and areal number
density etc. need to be further controlled at a specific level. Due to
the broader selection of liquid precursors, FS based on liquid precur-
sors deserves much more efforts for the growth of 1D structured
materials. Meanwhile, the in-depth understanding of growth mech-
anisms through in situ characterization techniques is desirable.
The fabrication of complex (e.g. doped materials) and hybrid (e.
g. core/shell structures) materials desirable for specific applica-
tion to enhance thin film performances should be further
attempted by either individual FS process or FS combined tech-
nique. The flame synthesized 1D structured thin films have been
attempted for various applications such as PEC water splitting
and solar cell etc. In view of the large surface-to-volume ratio of
1D structure, the more exciting applications of flame synthesized
1D nanostructured thin films remain a topic of active researches
in future.

PWe hope that this review article will be beneficial for the special-
ists working in the combustion field, and may help them for finding
new and non-standard approaches to fabricate inorganic nanostruc-
tures of various dimensions and nanodevices with improved physi-
cal, chemical and mechanical properties.
