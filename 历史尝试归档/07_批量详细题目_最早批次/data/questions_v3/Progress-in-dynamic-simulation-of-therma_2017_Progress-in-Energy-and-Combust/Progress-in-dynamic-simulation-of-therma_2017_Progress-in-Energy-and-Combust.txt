While the conventional design of thermal power plants is mainly focused on high process efficiency, market
requirements increasingly target operating flexibility due to the continuing shift towards renewables. Dynamic
simulation is a cost-efficient tool for improving the flexibility of dispatchable power generation in transient
operation such as load changes and start-up procedures. Specific applications include the optimisation of con-
trol structures, stress assessment for critical components and plant safety analysis in malfunction cases. This
work is a comprehensive review of dynamic simulation, its development and application to various thermal
power plants. The required mathematical models and various components for description the basic process,
automation and electrical systems of thermal power plants are explained with the support of practical example
models. The underlying flow models and their fundamental assumptions are discussed, complemented by an
overview of commonly used simulation codes. Relevant studies are summarised and placed in context for dif-
ferent thermal power plant technologies: combined-cycle power, coal-fired power, nuclear power, concen-
trated solar power, geothermal power, municipal waste incineration and thermal desalination. Particular
attention is given to those studies that include measurement validation in order to analyse the influence of
model simplifications on simulation results. In conclusion, the study highlights current research efforts and
future development potential of dynamic simulation in the field of thermal power generation.

1. Introduction

PThe expansion of intermittent electricity generation, in particular
wind power and photovoltaics, can lead to the seemingly paradox
situation of negative electricity prices at times of low power demand
and/or high renewable power supply. The main reason is the relative
inflexibility of dispatchable power generation such as coal and
nuclear power, which send a negative price signal in order to avoid a
cost-intensive unit shutdown. Five major approaches to maintain
security of supply and to improve flexibility of the future electricity
system can be distinguished in general [1]: (i) expansion of high-
voltage transmission infrastructure, (ii) enrollment of demand
response, (iii) modification to system operations, (iv) large-scale
energy storage and (v) flexibly dispatchable power generation. The
authors are convinced that the future electricity system will com-
prise all of these concepts, to varying degrees and with the possible
addition of value-adding processes beyond electricity (e.g. power-
to-fuels). However, the concepts differ in their potential impact,
technological maturity and economic viability. The latter aspect is
especially important, considering that there is often no direct reim-
bursement to a market participant for providing flexibility (with the
exception of participation in the limited balancing energy market).

Pi. The adequate addition of high-voltage transmission infrastruc-
ture in combination with smart power electronics is essential
to accommodate the growing renewable capacity and ensures
security of supply. By increasing the number of interconnec-
tions between major load centres, the transmission capacity
and robustness of the electricity grid can be greatly improved.
For sufficient flexibility of the overall system, the grid expan-
sion must be complemented by additional measures. Environ-
mental and political challenges are common causes for the
protracted expansion of grid infrastructure.

Pii. Demand response is the ability of end users to adjust load
demand (could be reduce or increase) according to price signals
or dispatch rules. This measure can be applied to mitigate or
counteract short-term grid imbalances.

Piii. The average forecast errors of regional wind and solar power
generation typically range from 3% to 6% one hour-ahead and
6% to 8% a day-ahead (based on rated capacity) [2]. Improved
forecasting decreases the uncertainty in residual load, resulting
in reduced utilisation of expensive peaking capacity and a
cost-effective modification of system operations. Both (ii) and
(iii) are support measures under development with the poten-
tial to effectively reduce costs associated with the transforma-
tion of the electricity system.

Piv. Large-scale energy storage, also called grid-energy storage, can
be charged or discharged flexibly to allow for high shares of
renewable electricity feed-in. Grid-energy storage is, in theory,
ideally suited to balance intermittent power supply and
demand. Pumped hydroelectric storage is commonly used, but
it is limited to suitable geographical conditions. Other technolo-
gies in various stages of development include battery energy
storage, flywheel energy storage, compressed air energy stor-
age, power-to-gas and thermal energy storage. Despite recent
advances in battery storage driven by the automotive industry,
the specific costs of these storage systems still limit their use to
small-scale applications and there is currently no economically
viable storage technology available for the required order of
capacity (TWh rather than MWh).

Pv. The most economic option for increasing system flexibility is to
improve the existing infrastructure of electricity supply. In
many countries without abundant natural resources suitable
for large hydro or geothermal energy, power generation is
mainly based on thermal power plants (and will continue to do
so in the foreseeable future, considering plant lifetimes of up to

P40 years). The operating flexibility of thermal power plants is
limited by technical constraints such as ramp rates and mini-
mum load limit. Existing power plants can be retrofitted with
optimised components and control circuits to mitigate these
constraints and to meet enhanced flexibility requirements.
Highly dispatchable generating units such as combined-cycle
power plants and gas engines are also available to replace out-
dated plants.

PIn this work, the approach of flexibly dispatchable power genera-
tion (v) is reviewed based on the scientific literature dedicated to
dynamic simulation of thermal power plants.

1.1. Flexible power generation

PA thermal power plant ideally operates at steady state design
load, but it is also required to operate on so-called off-design load
conditions due to the fluctuations of supply and demand as well as
the increased penetration of renewable energy sources. In Europe,
these requirements translate into new operating challenges that can
be divided in three categories. Firstly, higher load gradients for both
positive and negative load changes are required. Furthermore, the
dynamic of start-up and shut-down procedures should also be opti-
mised in response to a sudden load change in the grid. Secondly, the
technical operating range of thermal power plants has to be
extended by re-evaluating the minimum load limit. Lower minimal
load potentially reduces the number of shut-down/start-up proce-
dures and thus lifetime consumption of thermally stressed compo-
nents. A complete shut-down is often not an option for combined
heat and power generation unless sufficient thermal storage capac-
ity is installed. Thirdly, high efficiency at part load is relevant since
the thermal power plants that were originally operated almost con-
tinuously at nominal load should now run in load-following opera-
tion. Here, a thermo-economic optimisation at different base loads
and off-design load conditions is necessary. A thermal power plant
that meets these new requirements will have a competitive advan-
tage in the electricity market.

POperating flexibility of thermal power plants is therefore an
essential factor for reliable grid stability as well as for economic
operation. Dynamic simulation offers an effective tool for optimising
the power plant performance and control structures as well as for
assessing capabilities and limitations of the system with regard to
process, materials, emissions or economics. This implies strong
requirements on both model accuracy and efficiency of the numeri-
cal solver. Modern simulation programmes provide user interfaces,
solution algorithms and component libraries for full-scale modelling
and simulation of the dynamic processes. These simulation codes
are based on different thermal hydraulic models that are described
with the governing conservation equations for mass, momentum,
energy and empirical correlations for friction and heat transfer. For
modelling of thermal power plants, different process components
such as pipe, heat exchanger, drum and pump etc. are required. In
addition to process components, a thermal power plant includes
several automation and electrical systems. The accurate description
of automation structures and control devices are essential in order
to obtain a realistic dynamic response. The consideration of electri-
cal components in the dynamic simulation is necessary to compute
the electrical power consumption and to study malfunction cases
with loss of electricity supply.

PMost power plant processes are based on the generation of
superheated steam at high pressure, driving a steam turbine coupled
with an electrical generator. In water/steam evaporator circuits,
two-phase flows are generally present. As this flow type is compli-
cated and shows diverse flow patterns, a number of two-phase mod-
els with various levels of complexity were proposed in literature.
There are typically two categories of two-phase flow models: In the

Pfirst category, the two-phase flow is considered as mixture and
treated as single-phase flow with fairly complex thermodynamic
properties. The water and steam phases are assumed to be in ther-
modynamic equilibrium with equal velocity, pressure and tempera-
ture. The second category of two-phase flow models treats each
phase as a fluid and accordingly, separate sets of conservation equa-
tions for gas and liquid phase are formulated. In addition to the
conservation equations, adequate constitutive equations and experi-
mental correlations are required. These can be tables for thermody-
namic and transport properties or relations for heat transfer
coefficients. The classic six-equation version of the two-fluid model
is a single pressure model. Here, both phases are in mechanical equi-
librium, but not in chemical and thermal equilibrium. The seven-
equation flow model considers separate phases and does not
assume, by contrast to the six-equation flow model, pressure equi-
librium of phases. The five-equation and four-equation versions of
the two-fluid model assume mechanical and thermal equilibrium,
but not chemical equilibrium.

1.2. Structure

PThis review is divided in two main parts: In the first part (Chapter
2), the mathematical background for modelling of thermal power
plants is described, including an overview of simulation programmes
that are applied to predict the behaviour of these systems in steady
state and during transients. The mixture flow model and the two-
phase fluid models (four-equation, five-equation, six-equation and
seven-equation flow model) are explained. Process, automation and
electrical components required for the dynamic simulation of thermal
power plants are also described, supported by model examples.

PThe second part of this manuscript (chapters 3 to 7) is dedicated
to the relevant body of literature, focusing on the application of
dynamic simulation to specific energy system technologies: com-
bined-cycle power, coal-fired power, nuclear power, concentrated
solar power, geothermal power, municipal waste incineration and
thermal desalination. Most of these technologies can also supply
useful thermal energy for industrial processes, district heating and
increasing the power plant flexibility and
other applications,
decreasing the total fuel consumption. This approach is known as
combined heat and power (CHP) and relevant studies are referenced
in the corresponding chapters. The dynamic studies on CHP fre-
quently address the optimal operating strategy for a given use case,
which may be selected among following electric load (FEL), follow-
ing thermal load (FTL) or a specific mixture thereof.

PChapter 3 is a survey of publications on dynamic simulation
applied to gas-turbine based power plants, with particular regard to
combined-cycle power plants. In the field of power generation, com-
bined-cycle power plants (CCCP) are widely recognized for high
efficiency, fast start-up capability and comparatively low environ-
mental impact. The technology also supports increasing shares of
renewable feed-in due to flexible unit dispatch. After a summary of
general CCPP development, Section 3.1 introduces the reader to
basic plant dynamics by considering parameter variations and load
changes. The studies on simulation and optimisation of CCPP start-
up procedures are covered in Section 3.2. The start-up transient has
a distinct position among operating transients, which is also
reflected in the literature. Finally, Section 3.3 is a brief overview of
complementary works on dynamic simulation in the broader con-
text of gas-turbine based technology, including numerical studies of
compressed-air energy storage and integrated gasification com-
bined-cycle.

PChapter 4 gives an overview of publications that investigate the
transient operation of coal-fired power plants. With regard to
installed capacity, coal-fired power plants are the most important
generating units in many countries. Following a short description of
the working principle of the coal-fired plant, the dynamic models

Pare reviewed. Furthermore, the response of the numerical models to
disturbances is discussed, which is a common approach to verify the
model performance when operational data is missing. The relevant
investigations of start-up procedures, stress in thick-walled compo-
nents and power plant optimisation are introduced. The final section
of this chapter focuses on oxyfuel coal-fired power plants for carbon
capture and storage (CCS).

PChapter 5 offers an overview of dynamic process simulation for
nuclear power plants (NPPs). For this purpose, the differences
between nuclear power plants and conventional thermal power
plants are addressed. The chapter gives a description of the unique
and thorough validation process that is used in the field of nuclear
safety analysis and refers to further studies in that field. In this con-
text, the statistical approach to safety analysis is presented as well.
The topic of load-following operation and its challenges regarding
nuclear power plants is discussed, including the special issue of neu-
tronic-thermal hydraulic instability.

PChapter 6 is dedicated to concentrated solar power (CSP) technol-
ogy. CSP is a renewable technology that is characterized by simple
integration of energy storage. It uses mirrors, lenses or a combina-
tion of both to concentrate solar rays on a receiver, heating a work-
ing fluid that directly or indirectly runs a thermodynamic process to
generate electricity. Currently, levelised costs of energy (LCOE) are
relatively high. However, recent technical improvement and operat-
ing experience show potential for efficiency increase, standardisa-
tion and cost reduction. The review lists recent studies that were
conducted to analyse dynamic behaviour of whole CSP plants and
single sub-systems such as solar field, thermal energy storage and
power block. Results and scope of these studies are presented and
future areas of investigation are derived.

PChapter 7 offers insight into several technologies that are less
frequently considered in dynamic studies, namely geothermal
power, municipal waste incineration and seawater desalination.
Geothermal power plants use heat released from the earth's
crust to drive a Rankine cycle. Until now, a little work has been
done to explore the dynamic behaviour of these plants. Munici-
pal solid waste incineration is used to significantly decrease
waste volume as well as to produce stable and odourless residue.
Although municipal waste incineration has been applied com-
mercially for many decades in industrialised countries,
the
dynamic behaviour has not yet been investigated in the litera-
ture. Calculation results for the start-up procedure of a waste
incineration plant are shown in this review for the first time.
Industrial thermal desalination processes such as multi-stage
flash and multiple-effect desalination are very energy-intensive
and cost-intensive processes that ensure a stable and sustainable
source of drinking water in arid regions with sea access. The
chapter includes an explanation of the working principle of ther-
mal seawater desalination and an overview of numerical studies.
PIn the conclusion of this work, the results of the literature review
and current developments are summarised. Furthermore, recom-
mendations for further research effort in the field of dynamic simu-
lation of thermal power plants are given.

2. Mathematical modelling

PModern thermal power plants have to be designed for maxi-
mum efficiency, low emissions and high flexibility with regard to
load changes, start-ups and shutdowns. In complementing the
experimental works, mathematical models contribute to a better
understanding of the processes, their capabilities and limitations
and play an important role for increasing the efficiency and flexi-
bility of thermal power plants. Generally, design and optimisation
of energy systems start with steady state modelling. Here, it is
assumed that the power plant operates continuously at its design
base load. The steady state models do not require control

Pstructures and are mathematically based on mass, momentum,
species and energy balances. Using steady state simulation tools,
analyses of the thermodynamic properties of the working fluid,
mass and energy flows as well as process efficiency can be con-
ducted for a series of operating points. However, steady state sim-
ulation tools do not allow any information about
transient
operations. The relevant next step is therefore the process analy-
sis with dynamic models during transients, load changes and mal-
function cases. Dynamic simulation is preferred for the proposal
stage of a power plant project, e.g. to check whether or not the
load changes according to specific customer requirements are fea-
sible without unacceptable lifetime consumption in thick-walled
investigation into the dynamic perfor-
components. However,
mance of thermal power plants requires detailed information of
the process. The inherent complexity of the governing differential
conservation equations and the numerical solution methods make
the dynamic simulation codes very sophisticated computer soft-
ware with long development periods.

2.1. Overview

PThe first simulation program for thermal power plants dates back
to the 1960s. In the early 1970s, a method was developed, in which a
water/steam circuit was solved numerically. Here, the circuit was
constructed using individual components connected through lines.
The main components of the water/steam circuit as well as the con-
nection lines were systematised in code, so the entire circuit can be
defined as a sequence of numbers and interpreted by the computer.
This representation (selecting from the library and building compo-
nent by component) has been widely maintained in most simulation
programmes since. Based on this methodology, for example, Stama-
telopoulo [3] developed in 1995 an in-house code in the frame of a
steady state simulation project of thermal power plants. In line with
increasing interest on dynamic simulation, Stamatelopoulo and his
successors [4] presented a transient simulation program (known as
ENBIPRO) based on the finite volume method (FVM), which was fur-
ther extended by other researchers. Today, modern simulation pro-
grammes combine a graphical user interface with detailed models
for flow, thermodynamics and heat transfer. The calculations enable
rapid assessment of:

P(cid:3) New plant design.
P(cid:3) Process modifications and retrofitting of existing plants.
P(cid:3) Plant optimisation.
P(cid:3) Plant security and safety.
P(cid:3) Operating behaviour at base loads, off-design loads, start-up and

shut-down procedures.

P(cid:3) Operating behaviour during malfunctions.

PThe mathematical background of these programmes is based on
the balance equations of mass, momentum, species and energy. The
complexity of these equations and the required numerical solution
algorithms depends on, firstly whether the flow problem is steady
state, quasi-steady or dynamic:

P(cid:3) In steady state simulation, the time derivatives are eliminated

from the conservation equations.

P(cid:3) In dynamic simulation, the time derivatives must be taken into

consideration.

P(cid:3) In quasi-steady simulation, the time derivative of certain compo-
nents is not relevant and it can be consequently neglected in the
conservation equations, which in return simplifies the system of
equations significantly.

and secondly on the dimension of flow problem (zero-dimensional,
one-dimensional, two-dimensional or three-dimensional):

P(cid:3) In case of zero-dimensional modelling, the local discretisation is
not considered. The modelling of thermal power plant compo-
nents such as heat exchanger, pump, condenser, turbine, etc.,
results in an algebraic system of equations with the inputs and
output parameters of the components (pressure, enthalpy, mass
flow rate and concentration).

P(cid:3) In case of one-dimensional modelling, the thermal power plant
components are discretised between the inlet and outlet along
the flow in finite objects, resulting in so(cid:1)called numerical grid.
The partial differential equations obtained are thus approxi-
mated by an algebraic system of equations. Finally, the state vari-
ables such as temperature, enthalpy and pressure at each
discrete location can be determined.

P(cid:3) In case of two-dimensional or three-dimensional modelling, local
discretisation of the additional coordinates is required, resulting
in more detailed and computationally more expensive calcula-
tion of the thermal power plant components.

PThe knowledge of the steady state data of process components is
sufficient in many practical engineering applications. Design calcula-
tions at different loads are also conducted with such steady state
simulation models. Dynamic simulation allows investigation into
the transient behaviour of the entire thermal power plant with its
related control structures. Furthermore, the dynamic behaviour after
accidents in case of nuclear power plants is of major relevance for
safe operation. Despite the advantages that dynamic simulation
offers, the programming effort and computational time is consider-
ably higher compared to steady state calculations.

PSeveral in-house developed codes and commercial software pro-
grammes for steady state and dynamic process simulation of ther-
mal power plants are available, e.g. EBSILON Professional, APROS
and ASPEN Plus DYNAMICS. Some programmes provide specialised
component libraries for steady state and time-dependent simulation
of energy systems, including combined-cycle, simple cycle plants
and many others. Other programmes such as MATLAB/SIMULINK
offer the researcher an open interface for modelling of non-standard
components. Using the non-proprietary object-oriented, equation-
based language (MODELICA), complex physical systems with
mechanical and control subcomponents can be modelled. Based on
MODELICA, different non-commercial and commercial simulation
environments are also available such as DYMOLA, JModelica.org and
SimulationX. In nuclear technology, dynamic simulation codes cal-
culate the complex multi-phase phenomena in regular operation
and in accident situations. Such programmes were developed in
many countries that designed nuclear reactors, e.g. RELAP in the US,
CATHARE in France and ATHLET in Germany.

PThe above mentioned programmes differ in terms of function and
areas of application. Since the development of the programs is ongo-
ing, no details about scope of application can be given. The steady
state simulation programmes listed in Table 1 and the dynamic sim-
ulation programmes listed in Table 2 are the result of long-term
development by companies or universities and are usually not freely
accessible. The lists are non-exhaustive and restricted to widely
known programmes, which are both used in industrial practice and
scientific research. The cited references, among others, are matched
with the corresponding simulation code and give the reader an ori-
entation for the application fields of each program. The fact that no
study is listed for a certain application does not imply that the simu-
lation code is unable to cover it.

2.2. Thermal hydraulic models

PThe state of the art in modelling the thermal hydraulic of thermal
power plants differs in the fundamental physical models. Here, various
formulations (conservative or non-conservative) have been suggested
and different numerical methods for compressible and incompressible

Pflows were investigated. The complexity of the process is explained by
the occurrence of several two-phase flow regimes, heat conduction in
solid structures, heat transfer between fluid and solid structures, heat
and mass transfer between gas and liquid.

PThe thermal hydraulic models describe the steady state and
dynamic behaviour of a single phase flow or a two-phase flow. Many
approaches can be found in the literature in order to model the two-
phase flow in a thermal power plant such as mixture flow model or
two-fluid models, including four-equation, five-equation, six-equa-
tion and even seven-equation flow models. In the two-fluid models,
two sets of conservation equations are formulated, governing the
mass, momentum and energy balance for each phase. This formula-
tion presents considerable difficulty by reason of mathematical com-
plexity and the uncertainty in modelling the interaction between
phases at the interphase boundary. Generally, these relations cannot
be derived from fundamental physical laws and in most cases are
based on empirical assumptions. Solving the resulting differential
equations requires higher computational effort and entails parame-
ters that may cause numerical instability, especially due to improper
selection of interfacial terms. The difficulties associated with the
two-fluid models can be significantly reduced by formulating the
two-phase flow in terms of the mixture flow model. Here, three
characteristic fluid variables are computed, including local pressure,
total mass flux and temperature or enthalpy, represented by three
conservation equations (mass, momentum and energy) of the

Pmixture. Due to its simplicity and applicability to a wide range of
two-phase flow regimes, this model is of considerable relevance
since the response of the total mixture and not of each constituent
phase is often sufficient. The two-fluid models become, however,
more appropriate for special applications since they offer the possi-
bility to include non-equilibrium thermodynamic situations into the
formulation. Furthermore, the two-fluid models allow the treatment
of the conservation equations and thus the description of phase
boundaries in an easier way. This problem can clearly be observed in
the mixture flow model that uses many closure models, resulting in
approximate solutions and accordingly accuracy restrictions for cer-
tain applications.

PThe steady state and dynamic behaviour of thermal power plants
can also be described using the lumped parameter model that also
known as the lumped element model. Here, the description of the
physical system is simplified by mean of discrete control volumes
(zones or lumps) that are connected each other by means of thermal
resistors and capacitors with the assumption of a small temperature
difference inside each lump. The equivalent thermal network con-
sists of thermal resistance, thermal capacitances and power losses
inside the system. The lumped parameter model can be applied to
electrical and mechanical systems, heat transfer processes and ther-
mal hydraulic analysis of conventional thermal power plants includ-
ing nuclear reactors. The application of the lumped parameter
model is suitable, when a simplified formulation of the transient
behaviour of the process is required. The advantage of such an
approach lies in the reduced computational cost, but it does not offer
the same accuracy of more complex numerical methods such as mix-
ture and two-fluid models. The lumped element model is outside the
scope of this review and further information can be found for exam-
ple in [162].

PIn the following sections, the mixture flow model and the differ-

ent two-fluid models are explained in detail.

P2.2.1. Mixture flow model

PThe one-dimensional mixture flow model (also known as homo-
geneous or three-equation flow model) assumes thermodynamic
equilibrium between phases. The mixture flow model is represented
by three-partial differential equations for mass, momentum and
energy that describe the steady state and dynamic behaviour of the
characteristic variables. For single phase flow components (e.g.
superheater, reheater, turbine section and economiser), the three
characteristic fluid variables are the local pressure, the total mass
flux and the fluid temperature or the fluid enthalpy for subcooled
water or superheated steam. In case of two-phase flow components
(e.g. evaporator and condenser), the three variables are comple-
mented by the void fraction. The void fraction can be computed by
adding a fourth additive constitutive equation. The latter is a drift-
flux correlation that describes an adequate relation between differ-
ent two-phase parameters, e.g. a relation between the steam quality
or steam mass flux and steam void fraction. The drift-flux closure
laws that allow a slip relation between phases are based on theoreti-
cal, empirical or semi-empirical approaches. Several studies have
been carried out, resulting in numerous void fraction experiments
and different drift-flux correlations, which show significant devia-
tions. Bhagwat and Ghajar [163] evaluated the correlations available
in the literature and observed that the tested correlations, although
predicting the void fraction with desired accuracy at a certain point,
were inaccurate for a broad range of operating conditions. Further-
more, the correlations that predict the void fraction accurately for
vertical pipe orientation fail in case of inclined pipe orientations.
According to Bhagwat and Ghajar [164], the recommended correla-
tions by the above mentioned studies lose their accuracy at higher
pressure, large pipe diameter and for fluids with higher dynamic vis-
cosity than water. In conclusion, there is no closure relation that reli-
ably predicts the void fraction for a suitable range of flow patterns,

heat flow through walls per volume. The symbols r and u refer to
the density and longitudinal velocity of fluid, respectively. The func-
tion f considers the pressure losses due to valve and form frictions as
well as the hydrostatic pressure differences and the pressure force
of a pump. The total enthalpy h0 is the static enthalpy including the

contain additional mass flows into the system, or vice versa. The
pressure derivative term appears in the energy equation due to the
fact that the total enthalpy is used instead of the internal energy U.

PIn thick-walled tubes (e.g. drum and feedwater storage tank), the
lower part is pure water and the upper part is pure steam. Here, the
composition of the outflowing fluid from the tank is determined by
the water level and the connected branch height. Generally, the
number of connected branches to the tank is not limited. The branch
inlet height must, however, be in the height range of the tank. When
the water level is below the branch height, the flow consists of
steam, while it consists of water if the water level is above the
branch height. In between, there is a transition region, where the
composition of the leaving fluid is gradually changing from water to
steam.

PIn case of two-phase systems, the formulation of the mixture
flow model is the fundamental physical laws for the conservation of
mass, momentum and energy with the movement between the two
phase flow using drift-flux correlations. In this model, the four char-
acteristic fluid variables are the local pressure, the total mass flux,
the temperature or enthalpy and the void fraction. The mixture

PIn conclusion, the formulation of the homogenous flow model is
based on the mixture balance equations. In two-phase flow regions,
the relative motion between phases is taken into account by a kine-
matic constitutive equation. The constitutive equations are, gener-
ally, derived by considering interfacial geometry, body-force field,
shear stresses and interfacial momentum transfer. Due to its sim-
plicity and applicability to a wide range of two-phase flow, the mix-
ture flow model with drift-flux correlations is often used when the
response of the total mixture and not of each constituent phase is
required. Therefore, this flow model can be found in most of simula-
tion programmes such as APROS, ASPEN Plus DYNMICS and PPSD.
However, one should distinguish between the drift-flux models,
where it is assumed that the two-phase flow can be expressed by

Pthe momentum equation of the mixture complemented by a kine-
matic equation specifying the relative motion between phases and
the two-fluid models (see the following section), where the velocity
of each phase is solved separately.

P2.2.2. Two-fluid model

PThe two-fluid models, also known as heterogeneous or
Euler(cid:1)Euler flow model, formulate separate conservation equa-
tions of mass, momentum and energy for gas and liquid phase.
The two-fluid models describe the two-phase flow more accu-
rately than the mixture flow model, but the definition of the
interaction terms between phases is difficult. This is due to the
fact that the interaction terms cannot be determined from physi-
cal laws and are generally obtained from experiments under sev-
eral artificial assumptions. Here, careful study of the interfacial
constitutive equations is required, since the improper selections
of these terms may result in numerical instability. Due to the
increased number of differential equations and closure relations,
the two-fluid models,
in contrast to mixture flow model, are
related to higher computational cost and are suitable for thermo-
dynamic non-equilibrium applications. Accordingly, the complex
and time-consuming two-fluid models are only implemented in
few simulation programmes such as APROS and RELAP.

PIn the two-fluid models, the velocities and temperatures of
each phase are independent, as opposed to the mixture flow
model with drift-flux correlations, where there is only one
momentum equation and one energy equation of mixture. The
four-equation or five-equation model assumes mechanical and
thermal equilibrium, but not chemical equilibrium. In the six-
equation version of the two-fluid models, the phases are in
mechanical equilibrium (they are at the same pressure), but not
in chemical and thermal equilibrium. The seven-equation version
of the two-fluid model allows the phases to be completely in
non-equilibrium state. In the latter, each phase has its own pres-
sure, own velocity and temperature. According to Stuhmiller
[166], the seven-equation flow model avoids the non-hyperbolic-
ity of the six-equation flow model that can lead to ill-posed
Cauchy problems. Mathematically, a hyperbolic partial differen-
tial equation of order n has a well-posed initial value problem
for the first n ¡ 1 derivatives, i.e. the Cauchy problem is solved
locally for certain initial data of any non-characteristic hypersur-
face [167]. In all two-fluid models (excepting the seven-equation
model), the void fraction is generally determined by the interfa-
cial drag. The latter is calculated based on drift-flux correlations
for the distribution parameter and void-weighted area-averaged
drift velocity.

PNon-condensable gases may affect the dynamic behaviour of
thermal power plants, particularly nuclear power plants. The
non-condensable gases can be nitrogen, oxygen, helium or
hydrogen that are mixed with steam phase or dissolved in liquid
phase. These gases can also be transferred from one phase to
another. For example, when the nuclear power plant operates at
normal operation for long period, the nitrogen that is used to
pressurise the hydro-accumulators and other systems is dis-
solved into the liquid phase. In case of primary circuit breaks,
the accumulator water is injected into the primary circuit, caus-
ing lower pressure and accordingly the release of dissolved
nitrogen from liquid to gas phase [168]. Furthermore, dissolved
oxygen, carbon dioxide and other gases in feedwater leads to
serious corrosion damages in the steam generator components
and should therefore be removed using a deaerator system.
Accordingly, the treatment of non-condensable gases has to be
taken into account the simulation programmes that are used in
safety analysis work. Generally, the modelling of non-condens-
able gases can be considered in the formulation of the two-fluid
models.

This version of two-fluid model contains one mixture mass equa-
tion, one mixture energy equation and two momentum equa-
tions for gas and liquid phase. Therefore, the phase velocities are
independent from each other, in contrast to the mixture flow
model with drift-flux correlations that uses one momentum
the mixture. The four conservation equations,

perature) as well as gas and liquid velocities, are expressed as:

script ext refers to an external pressure source/sink such as pump
and losses due to valve and component-specific friction. The symbol
qwal denotes the wall heat flow per volume.

P2.2.2.2. Five-equation model.
PIn the five-equation model, mass bal-
ances for each phase are required instead of a mass equation of mix-
ture in the four-equation flow model. The five-equation model can
either be formulated with thermal equilibrium or with drift-flux cor-
relation.

PThe first version of the five-equation model assumes mechan-
ical and thermal equilibrium between phases (pressure and tem-
perature are kept equal), but the phases will generally not be in
chemical equilibrium. Here, mass and momentum conservation
equations are solved for gas and liquid separately, while the
energy equation is only solved for gas-liquid mixture. The five
transient, partial differential equations of two-phase flow can be
formulated as below.

PThe term inside the time derivative expresses the temporal
change of gas or liquid flow rate. The term inside the space
derivative is equal to the changes of flow momentum along the
integration axis z. The last term on the right-hand side of the
momentum equation describes the influence of pressure on the
momentum conservation due to the axial pressure distribution
and external pressure forces such as pump or losses due to valve
and form friction.

and liquid separately, while the momentum equation is only solved
for gas-liquid mixture. Here, the summation of gas and liquid

P2.2.2.3. Six-equation model.
PThe six-equation flow model, in contrast
to the four-equation model and the five-equation model, has
attracted more attention in the scientific literature. This flow model
allows chemical and thermal non equilibrium (velocity and temper-
ature disequilibrium between phases), but assumes mechanical
equilibrium (the phases are at the same pressure at all time). The
six-equation flow model is suitable for water/steam mixture with
dominating mass and heat transfer between phases. It is character-
ised by separate conservation equations of mass, momentum and

Penergy for gas and liquid phase. However, the formulation of two
complete sets of conservation equations presents considerable diffi-
culty by reason of mathematical complexity and modelling uncer-
tainty of the interaction terms between phases. The six-equation
model is therefore more prone to numerical instability, in particular
vis-(cid:2)a-vis the mixture flow model.

PThis section describes the six-equation flow model, as imple-
mented in the advanced process simulation software (APROS) [169].
The solution of the six-equation flow model is based on the one-
dimensional six partial differential equations, from which the pres-
sure, the void fractions, the phase velocities and enthalpies are
solved. As previously mentioned, the application of the six-equation
flow model requires the knowledge of mass, momentum and energy
transfer between phases. These interaction terms can be determined
using the flow parameters and their derivatives coupled with empir-
ical correlations for various gas/liquid flow regimes. If the two-phase
flow also includes non-condensable gases, additional conservation
equations, describing the behaviour of the non-condensable gases
are required.

refers to the interface between two phases and the subscript wal, k
denotes the interface between one phase and the wall. The term G is
the mass exchange rate between phases. The function fk considers
the effects of valves, pumps and friction on the flow. The terms Fand
q represent to the average friction force per volume and the heat
flow per volume, respectively. In the energy equation, the symbol h0

terms E and x are the rate of entrainment and the liquid concentra-
tion in the flow. The critical pressure of the steam/water mixture pcri
is equal to 22.06 MPa.

PThe wall heat flow qwal.k is determined depending on the heat
transfer zone. Generally, three heat transfer zones can be distin-
guished: wetted wall, dry wall and a transition zone between
wetted wall and dry wall. When the wall temperature is lower
than the saturation temperature of the liquid, single phase flow
is assumed to be in contact with the wall. During this stage, the
heat flux rises with increasing wall temperature. If the heat flux
has exceeded the critical heat flux, the wall starts drying out and
accordingly the heat transfer decreases sharply. The transition
zone ranges from the critical heat flux temperature to the mini-
mum film boiling temperature. Above this temperature, the dry
wall zone stars. Here, only the gas phase touches the wall and
the heat flux begins to increase again. The critical heat flux and

PThe heat flux on a wetted wall can be defined according to several
correlations, e.g. the Dittus(cid:1)Boelter correlation for forced convec-
tion and the Thom correlation for nucleate boiling [172]. The nucle-
ate boiling starts when the wall temperature exceeds the saturation
temperature of the liquid. The heat flow is expressed as follows

therefore additional equations may be required. This can be a non-

geneous mixture, then the steam and the non-condensable gas have
the same temperature and velocity. Thus, only one additional partial

required:

wall and liquid, gas and liquid must also include additional
terms in order to consider the influence of non-condensable
gases.

P2.2.2.4. Seven-equation model.
PThe two-phase six-equation flow
model accounts for significant non-equilibrium of phases, but still
assumes pressure equilibrium. The seven-equation model (also
known as two-pressure flow model) allows the phases to be
totally independent of each other. It solves the fluid dynamic
interface problems and the two-phase flow system simulta-
neously, resulting in separate pressure, velocity, temperature and
chemical potential for both phases. The model has two sets of
mass, momentum and energy conservation equations as well as
one volume fraction evolution equation that describes how the
fluid composition changes with time. Although the seven-equa-
tion flow model is different from the six-equation flow model,
many of the closure models in the six-equation flow model can
also be implemented here. The closure laws are determined from
the flow parameters and their derivatives, coupled with empirical
correlations, describing all regimes of the two-phase flow [176].

PIn the process simulation of thermal power plants and espe-
cially nuclear power plant, it is actually more common to apply
the two-fluid model with pressure equilibrium. The partial-dif-
ferential equation system related to the pressure equilibrium
suffers, however, from improper mathematical properties. The
eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix are not always real and may
assume complex values, which in turn lead to an ill-posed
Cauchy problem. The seven-equation model
systematically
allows seven real eigenvalues and is shown to have a well-
posed basis of eigenvectors, particularly in the context of com-
pressible two-phase flows.
In comparison to models using a
pressure equilibrium assumption, the unconditionally hyper-
bolic property makes the two-pressure seven-equation model
very attractive. Recently, this flow model has gained interest for
modelling of a wide range of applications, including non-equi-
free-surface two-fluid flow
librium dispersive two-fluid flow,
under the influence of gravity, boiling and flashing of super-
heated liquid as well as the bubble collapse in light water reac-
tor. However,
the seven-equation model also suffers from
several difficulties such as the model complexity and the pres-
ence of neoconservative products,
i.e. the model cannot be
equivalently recast in full conservative form. These neoconser-
vative products naturally disappear, when the void fraction is
locally constant in space and the model corresponds to two
decoupled gas dynamic systems.

PThis section describes the seven-equation model, as imple-
mented in the RELAP software [177]. The seven-equation flow model
for one-dimensional two-phase flow presents full mechanical and
thermodynamic non-equilibrium and consists of the following con-
servation equations.

PMost of the two-phase nomenclatures used in these sets of equa-
tions have already been mentioned. The interfacial mass transfer G
is here has the unit kg/m5s, while it is kg/m3s in other two-fluid mod-
els. The symbols A and Aint represent the flow cross-sectional area
and the specific interfacial area between phases (gas and liquid) per
unit volume. The terms pgas and pliq denote the gas pressure and the
liquid pressure. The symbol b refers to the interphase momentum
transfer coefficient (resistance coefficient). The terms pint and uint
represent the interfacial pressure and the interfacial velocity that
exerted on the surface of a two-phase control volume, where the
volume fraction gradients exist. These interfacial variables are
expressed as:

PSimilar to the six-equation flow model, the non-condensable
gases can be included in the framework of the seven-equation
flow model. The non-condensable gases can be a part of the gas
phase or dissolved in the liquid phase. In this case, additional
partial differential equations are expressed for non-condensable
gases in the gas phase (e.g. nitrogen, helium and hydrogen in the
steam) and for dissolved components in the liquid phase (e.g.
nitrogen, helium, hydrogen and even boron dissolved in water).

P2.2.3. Solution method

PIn order to solve the one-dimensional partial differential equations,
the finite difference solution method or the finite volume solution
method is, generally, applied. The partial differential equations are dis-
cretised with respect to space and time and the non-linear terms are
linearised. In the space discretisation (integration over the correspond-
ing element length), several discretisation schemes such as the first-
order upwind scheme, the second-order central differencing scheme
and the quadratic upwind interpolation are available. For time discreti-
sation, the implicit method is usually employed. The physical proper-
ties such as pressure, velocity and enthalpy in the model can finally be
calculated using the discretised conservation equations, the parame-
ters for inlet and outlet flows and the thermodynamic properties.

PAccording to the software APROS [169] that uses the finite vol-
ume solution method to solve the one-dimensional partial differen-
tial equations, the solution method includes:

P(cid:3) The conservation equations for mass, momentum and energy are

applied to the control volumes.

P(cid:3) Single phase flows, homogeneously mixed two phase flows, non-
equilibrium separate phase flows as well as laminar, turbulent or
critical flows can be considered. Furthermore, radiation, convec-
tion and diffusion as well as relevant heat transfer correlations
can be applied. Relevant chemical reactions can be assigned to
the control volumes in consideration.

P(cid:3) Material property libraries can be called with regard to relevant
parameters such as pressure, specific enthalpy and mass fraction.

P(cid:3) For valid application range, empirical correlations are used.
P(cid:3) The control system element models such as controllers, logical
signals and operations as well as sequential automation blocks
can be included functionality in the simulation model.

P(cid:3) The electrical components such as generator, electric motors,
electrical bus bars, network elements and converters can be
included functionality in the simulation model.

P(cid:3) The resulting one-dimensional partial differential equations are
discretised with respect to space. This can be performed using
different interpolation methods such as upwind interpolation,
linear interpolation, quadratic upwind interpolation and high-
order schemes.

P(cid:3) For unsteady flows, the time should be discretised, considering
relevant state variables and selected time steps. In order to
obtain the time dependent solution, initial conditions and bound-
ary conditions that can also depend on time must be defined.
P(cid:3) At the end of each time-step and for each control volume, mass
errors are checked and non-linearity errors are iteratively corrected.

P(cid:3) The physical values of working fluid in a control volume such as
mass flow, energy flow and separate substance are determined.
P(cid:3) The outputs of automation and electrical components are speci-

fied.

P2.2.4. Comparison

PIn the previous sections, different thermal hydraulic models
are presented such as the mixture flow model and the two-fluid
models. The selection of the appropriate flow model depends on
computational effort and desired level of accuracy. Although
the mixture flow model entails a less accurate description of
two-phase flow phenomena, in many cases it presents the most
efficient approach for
thermal
power plants. For a more detailed consideration of components
such as evaporator or condenser, a two-phase flow model
should be selected. In this section, two examples from the sci-
entific literature are presented, showing the mixture flow model
and the two-fluid models in direct comparison with measure-
ment data. The first study applied an in-house code, while the
second study used two different commercial simulation pro-
grammes.

PWippel [178] developed a dynamic simulation code (AHKSIM,
latter known as MISTRAL) with different
thermal hydraulic
models, i.e. mixture flow model and six-equation flow model. In
order to determine the volumetric void fraction,
the drift-
flow model according to Zuber and Findlay [165] was imple-
mented.

PThe distribution parameter C0 and average drift velocity of the
gas phase Vgas,j were computed using Rouhani and Chexal(cid:1)Lellouche
correlations.

PTwo heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) models were built
based on the mixture flow model and the six-equation flow model.
The investigated power plant is a simple single-pressure HRSG with-
out reheat. A breakdown case, in which the live steam valve was
suddenly opened, was simulated and the results obtained from both
HRSG models were compared to measurement. After opening the
live steam valve, the pressure in the system drops sharply and the
steam mass flow rate increases considerably. Since the heat input to
the HRSG remains constant, the steam temperature decreases by
reason of increased mass flow rate.
In Fig. 1, the comparison
between the measurement values and numerical results of mixture
flow model and six-equation flow model is illustrated. It can be
observed that the two-fluid model reproduces the system behaviour
with better accuracy compared to mixture flow model. Minor
differences can be noted between Rouhani correlation and Chex-
al(cid:1)Lellouche correlation, where the latter is slightly more favour-
able.

PAlobaid et al. [15,17] investigated into the capability of differ-
ent commercial simulation codes to predict the real behaviour of
a combined-cycle power plant during part loads, off-design oper-
ation and start-up. The combined-cycle power plant with a
three-pressure heat recovery steam generator and a single reheat
is built with the process simulation software tools ASPEN Plus
DYNAMICS using the mixture flow model and APROS using the
six-equation flow model.

PIn Fig. 2, the dynamic simulation results of the intermediate
pressure circuit including feedwater and steam mass flow rates,
pressure as well as the superheated steam temperature are pre-
sented for off-design operation. The intermediate pressure (IP)
feedwater mass flow rate obtained numerically agrees well with
measurement. Similar to the IP feedwater mass flow rate, the
simulated superheated steam mass flow rate follows accurately

Pthe measured data. However, a slight deviation that lasted for
30 min can be detected between the numerical models and the
real power plant in the period of time between t D 90 min and
t D 120 min. From t D 120 min on, both models show high accu-
racy with a maximum relative error of approximately 2%. The
superheated steam temperature calculated with the mixture
flow model overestimates the measured one, while the simulated
temperature in the six-equation model underestimates the mea-
surement. The numerical models reproduce qualitatively the
dynamic behaviour of the IP pressure. Compared to the mixture
flow model, the six-equation model simulates the dynamic pres-
sure change with higher accuracy, especially in time period
between t D 150 min and t D 400 min. Here,
the six-equation
model and the three-equation model show maximum relative
errors of about 3% and 7%, respectively.

PThe dynamic behaviour of the low pressure (LP) system
during start-up procedure is presented in Fig. 3. The calculated
feedwater mass flow rate matches very well with measurement.
However, the considerable oscillations in the measured feed-
water mass flow rate with average amplitude of 75 kg/s are not
predicted by the numerical models. Starting from t D 150 min,
the simulated feedwater mass flow rate lies marginally above
the measured data with a relative error of 2%. The computed
steam mass flow rate exiting from the LP superheater is in good
agreement with the real power plant. At t D 36 min, the timing
of first steam generation is accurately predicted by the six-
equation model, in contrast to the three-equation model. For
the latter, the steam production starts about 15 min earlier than
measurement. From t D 75 min, qualitative agreement between
simulation and experiment can be observed.

PThe steam temperature computed by the mixture flow model
shows acceptable agreement. Although the temperature jump
preceded the measured data by 20 min, the simulated gradient
is close to the real plant with a relative error of approximately
15%. From t D 75 min, the calculation of the steam temperature
is close to the measurement. Compared to the three-equation
model, the six-equation model shows quantitative agreement
with measurement. Prior to start-up, the LP drum level in the
six-equation model and experiment is equal to 2.3 m, while it is
2.22 m in the three-equation model. The level of the LP drum
obtained numerically by both models agrees very well with
experiment. However, the numerical models failed to simulate
time
the oscillations in the drum level
between t D 20 min and t D 120 min. The three-equation model
shows an almost smooth development of the LP drum level,
while the six-equation model predicts the level oscillations
more accurately.

PIn this comparative study between the three-equation flow
model and the six-equation flow model, the following conclusions
are drawn:

P1. In steady state, both three-equation flow model and six-equa-
tion flow model can quantitatively reproduce the process
parameters of a real power plant. The relative error for mass
flow rate, temperature and pressure are all within 5%, while
several parameters are captured with a relative error of less
than 1%.

P2. During off-design operation and start-up procedure, higher dis-
crepancy is observed. Both three-equation and six-equation flow
models can qualitatively follow the measurements with a

Pmaximum relative error of approximately 12%. Several parame-
ters are captured with a relative error of less than 5%.

P3. For the given case, the six-equation flow model describes the
behaviour of the real power plant during off-design operation
and start-up procedure more accurately compared to the three-
equation flow model. The correct time prediction of first steam
generation and temperature gradients as well as the better
reproduction of the measured parameter oscillations are advan-
tages of the six-equation flow model, at the cost of increased
computational effort.

2.3. Process components

PBasically, a conventional thermal power plant consists of a
flue gas side and a water/steam side. In the flue gas side, flows
of various reactants are injected into the combustion chamber,
where the reactions between oxidiser and hydrocarbon take
place. The released heat is transferred through radiation and
convection to the water/steam side, converting feedwater into
superheated steam. The latter expands in the steam turbine, pro-
ducing mechanical energy. Using an electrical generator, the
mechanical energy is then converted into electrical energy that
is transmitted to the grid. The process components required for
the modelling of a thermal power plant include points, thin-
walled tubes, thick-walled tubes, turbomachines etc. The tubes
of the economisers, evaporator and superheater heat exchangers
as well as the connecting pipes and valves belong to the thin-
walled tubes, while other components such as drum and header
belong to thick-walled tubes. The turbo-machines are rotating
devices that extract energy from or transfer energy to the work-
ing fluid. In this work, the term working fluid refers to water/
steam, flue gas, organic working fluids, etc.

P2.3.1. Connection point

PThe point or node component is the most basic process compo-
nent used in process simulation. It has no actual real process compo-
nent as a counterpart and is used to connect different kinds of
process components together. The point may have at least one inlet

Pflow and one outlet flow. The following mass and energy balances
can be expressed:

i D 1

_mout;i

_minl;ihinl;i

Xi D j

i D 1

_mout;ihout;i

ð2:69Þ

ð2:70Þ

PThe subscripts k and j represent the number of inlet flows and
outlet flows. In case of mixing two fluids with different compositions
such as natural gas and air, the materials balances of the individual
species must be computed and the mixture enthalpies calculated
accordingly. The pressure of all outlet flows involved is assumed to
be equal.

P2.3.2. Thin-walled tube

PThin-walled tubes are used as a representation of several differ-
ent structures in a power plant like pipes, valves and heat exchang-
ers. The thin-walled tubes incorporate a heat transfer model
between wall and fluid, heat storage and a pressure loss of the flow.
The wall temperature of thin-walled tubes can be modelled with a
constant temperature in the radial direction for simplification.
Berndt [179] calculated the wall temperature of thin-walled tubes,
formulating the wall energy balance under the assumption of infi-
nite thermal conductivity in the radial direction and negligible ther-
mal conductivity i;n the axial and tangential directions as follows:

characteristics of wall material such as density and heat capacity are
not subject to major change during the transient.

P2.3.2.1. Pipe.
PThe working fluid, other gaseous and liquid fluids can
be transported using pipes that entail pressure drop of the flow.
Numerically, the pipe component that is defined between two con-
nection points is applied to calculate the fluid flow (e.g. velocity).
Here, the shape and dimensions of pipes need to be specified. When
it is necessary, the heat storage into the pipe material or the heat
flow rate out from the pipe can be taken into account. In some appli-
cations (e.g. evaporator with natural circulation operation), the den-
sity differences at inlet and outlet have to be considered and are the
main driving force for the fluid.

PThe pressure drop of the flow in the pipe can be expressed as:

Dppip D fk

L

ð2:72Þ

PThe symbol fk represents the friction coefficient, rk and uk are the
density and the velocity of the fluid, L and D denote the length and
diameter of the pipe.

P2.3.2.2. Valve.
PIn a thermal power plant, the main task of a valve is to
achieve desired fluid flow rates. In the process simulation, the valve
model is considered as flow resistance. The pressure drop over the
valve can be computed as a sum of the pressure drop due to friction
coefficient fk and the pressure drop due to flow resistance coefficient
of the valve fval:

PThe valve is controlled using automation components and can
also be connected to electrical components to simulate its behaviour
during the loss of electricity. In thermal power plants, there are dif-
ferent kinds of valves used such as control valve, shut-off valve,
check valve and safety valve.

P(cid:3) For control valve, the flow resistance is calculated as a function of
the valve position that is a non-dimensional value between 0 and
1. The valve is fully closed, when the valve position is 0 and is
fully opened, when the valve position is 1. The control valve is
specified by a so-called characteristic curve that describes the

the characteristic curves are linear

Pcorrelation between the mass flow rate and the valve position.
(mass flow
Typically,
increases linearly with valve travel) or equal percentage (mass
flow increases exponentially with valve travel). In special cases,
different kind of curve types such as parabolic, hyperbolic or
square root can also be considered. The position of the control
valve is controlled by the automation system. The valve model
receives the new setpoint and computes valve movement during
the time step, taking into account the driving time of the valve.
The driving time of the valve is defined as the time required by
the valve actuator to open the valve from the fully closed position
to the fully opened position or vice versa. Large valves in thermal
power plants use hydraulic pressure or electricity, allowing typi-
cal driving times between 10 s and 30 s. Moreover, the process
simulation can incorporate loss of electrical energy supply. In
this case, there are three possible modes of valve operation: to
open, to close or to stay at the same position.

P(cid:3) The shut-off valves include different types such as butterfly
valve, flap valve and conical seat valve. The characteristic curve
of a shut-off valve is usually not known, but the driving time and
the flow resistance coefficient of a fully open valve are required.
However, there are generic characteristic curves of the flow resis-
tance coefficient as a function of the valve position for each valve
type. In contrast to the control valves, the binary signals TRUE or
FALSE control the shut-off valve. If the signal is TRUE, the valve
starts opening and the valve begins to close, when the signal is
FALSE. In break down cases (electrical power is lost), the shut-off
valve either stays in its current position, starts closing or opening
depending on the valve configuration.

P(cid:3) The check valve, also known as non-return valve or one-way
valve allows the fluid to flow through it in only one direction. It
is either fully open or fully closed. If the pressure difference over
the valve is positive, i.e. the pressure at the valve inlet is higher
than the pressure at the valve outlet, the valve is open. If the
pressure difference over the valve is negative, the check valve is
closed.

P(cid:3) A safety valve has the function of increasing the safety of thermal
power plants by limiting pressure in pressure vessels. Here, the

Pfluid is automatically discharged from a drum or other compo-
nents when the pressure exceeds the specified limit. In a pres-
sure safety valve, the opening position is linked to the pressure.

PThe

attemperator

P2.3.2.3. Attemperator/desuperheater.
(injection
cooler) limits the steam temperature to the setpoint value. In ther-
mal power plants, the attemperators are installed at superheater
and reheater surfaces to control the temperature at the inlet of the
high and intermediate pressure turbines. The attemperators use
water directly from the boiler feedwater pumps. The injected mass
flow rate is adjusted by a control circuit that controls the valve posi-
tion. While the attemperator controls the steam temperature, a
desuperheater removes the superheating of the steam and reduces
the temperature of the steam to a range between 10 °C and 50 °C
above saturation temperature. Desuperheaters are found e.g. in the
bypass system of the high pressure turbine, which routes the high
pressure steam not admitted by the turbine into the cold reheater or
condenser. Here, a desuperheater is installed that reduces the steam
temperature to approximately 50 °C above the saturated steam tem-
perature.

PIn thermal power plants, heat exchangers
P2.3.2.4. Heat exchanger.
are used, where heat transfer between one or more fluids takes
place. Based on the requirements, a variety of different heat
exchangers has been developed. Basically, the heat exchangers are
designed as regenerator and recuperator. In regenerators, the heat
transfer between fluids is carried out in two steps. In the first step,
the heat flow is transferred to a storage mass and in the second step
the energy stored is emitted to the heat-absorbing fluid after a time
delay. The charge/discharge cycle can be discontinuous or continu-
ous. An example of regenerators is the thermal wheel, also known as
a rotary air preheater. In recuperators, by contrast, the heat is trans-
ferred continuously between fluids through a solid wall. They repre-
sent the most commonly-used type of heat exchangers, including
double-pipe heat exchangers, plate heat exchangers, shell and tube
bundle heat exchangers etc. Depending on the flow configuration of
the fluids, it can be distinguished between co-current flow, counter-
current flow, cross-flow or hybrid flow arrangements. If phase-
change occurs in any of the fluids, the heat exchanger is referred to
as phase-change heat exchanger; otherwise it is a sensible heat
exchanger. In thermal power plants, the heat exchangers used are
listed as follows:

P(cid:3) Shell and tube bundle heat exchangers (economizer, evaporator,
superheater and reheater): This type of heat exchanger transfers
heat from the flue gas path to the water/steam circuit. It consists
of numerous, equally long, heated tubes installed in parallel. The
bundle of tubes is connected to one another by a header. The
working fluid flows through the tubes, while the flue gas flows
over the tubes, transferring heat between the two fluids.

P(cid:3) Membrane wall heat exchanger (evaporator): This type of heat
exchanger is installed on the combustion chamber walls of coal-
fired boilers.

P(cid:3) Feedwater preheater: This type of heat exchanger heats the feed-
water mass flow, before entering the steam generator using
steam extractions form the high and low pressure turbines.

P(cid:3) Condenser: This type of heat exchanger condensates the turbine
exhaust steam by means of cooling water or cooling air, depend-
ing on site conditions.

P(cid:3) Air and gas preheaters: These types of heat exchangers heat air or
natural gas for combustion using the heat of flue gas or process
steam.

PThe transport equations required to model the heat exchanger
used in thermal power plants are mass, momentum and energy
balances for flue gas flow and water/steam flow. Only the energy

Pbalance has to be solved for the tube wall, describing the heat
transport from the flue gas to the tube wall and from the tube
wall to the water/steam flow. In a tube bundle heat exchanger for
example, the heat flows to the tube wall
from the flue gas
(through convection and thermal radiation) and from an optional
flame-radiation zone of a combustion chamber. Then, the heat is
transferred from the tube wall to the working fluid. Fig. 4 illus-
trates the discretised structure of a counter-flow tube bundle
heat exchanger as an example. The flue gas path and water/steam
tubes are discretised in equally-spaced control volumes with one
calculation node in the centre and a calculation branch between
two adjacent nodes. Here, each control volume consists of a hori-
zontal pipe pass. To reduce the computational cost, each control
volume may consist of many horizontal pipes in parallel. The flue
gas path and the water/steam side are coupled by the heat flows
through the tube walls.

P2.3.3. Thick-walled tube

PThe assumption of constant temperature in the radial direction of
thin-walled components is acceptable for purposes of simplification.
In the case of thick-walled components that are usually not posi-
tioned in the flue gas path such as drum and header, this assumption
is non-permissible and can lead to errors, especially by calculating
the heat storage in the walls. The temperature profile in a thick-
walled component can be calculated by solving Fourier's differential
equation:

(cid:3)

D

@r

(cid:4)
λ

(cid:5)

@Twal

ð2:74Þ

PHere, the character λwal is the thermal conductivity of the wall. To
simplify the problem, the wall can be divided into individual circular
ring elements and the differential equation is solved numerically for
each segment. This discretisation is valid, if the thermal conduction
in the axial direction is negligible and the temperature distribution
is radially-symmetric [180].

PDuring start-up procedures of the thermal power plant, espe-
cially cold start-ups, the generated steam can condense on the
still-cool wall surface of
thick-walled components. The heat
transfer coefficient of the condensate is much higher than the
heat transfer coefficients of the steam and the boiling water in
the lower part of the drum, which in turn leads to different heat
fluxes along the wall. Accordingly, heat is transported in the tan-
gential direction of the drum wall. In order to consider heat
transport in radial and tangential direction, 2D calculation of the
heat conduction in the drum wall is required. In contrast, during
hot and even warm start-ups no condensation is present and
only small temperature differences between the upper and the
lower part of the drum occur. Therefore, the heat transfer in
thick-walled hollow cylinders can be reduced to heat conduction
in the radial direction.

PIn thick-walled components, the rate of temperature change is
usually required to calculate thermal stresses and thus to prove the
safety of operation during start-up and shutdown procedures of
boilers. Material stresses are calculated based on the recorded pres-
sure and temperature history. The thermal stresses are proportional
the difference between integral average wall temperature and inner
wall temperature:

stress concentration factor aT takes into account weakening of the
cylinder wall due to connected tubes, i.e. this factor is strongly
dependent on the geometry and weld joints. The average wall tem-
perature of a thick-walled component with a volume V can be

PHere, the symbols rin and rout are the inner and outer radius of the
hollow cylinder. From Eq. (2.77), it can be observed that the thermal
stresses are a quadratic function of the wall thickness, which in turn
increases with the design pressure.

PIn the following sections, the thick-walled tubes used in thermal
power plants will be explained, including header, drum, separator
and feedwater storage tank.

P2.3.3.1. Header.
PThe header is a thick wall pipe with large diameter
connected to a large number of heating surface tubes with relatively
small diameter (see Fig. 5). The headers are arranged at the inlet and
outlet of tube-bundle heat exchangers. The function of the inlet
header is to distribute the working fluid as uniformly as possible in
the tubes of the heat exchanger. The outlet header collects and
homogenises the working fluid from the tubes and feeds it to inter-
connecting pipes. As described above, the thick walls of headers can
store or release the heat from or to the working fluid during transi-
ents. Furthermore, the temperature gradients in the header walls
result in material and thermal stresses. Therefore, the headers used
in thermal power plants are designed with stringent requirements
for strength, corrosion and creep properties. The high mechanical
properties of the header are required on the one hand due to the
operation under harsh conditions, e.g. high temperature and pres-
sure, high rate of temperature and pressure changes, and on the
other hand due to the large number of connected tubes that contrib-
ute to cross-sectional weakening.

P2.3.3.2. Drum.
PThe drum is a horizontal, cylindrical shaped tank
with comparatively thick walls. In natural or forced circulation ther-
mal power plants, the drum represents the core of the evaporator
system and has a variety of functions. It is used as link between the
downcomers and the risers, enabling the circulation of the working
fluid through evaporators. Furthermore, the drum separates steam
from the water/steam mixture by force of gravity using the density
difference between gaseous and liquid phase. The separation of the
two-phase mixture can be improved with different types of separa-
force, e.g. cyclone separators or simply
tors using centrifugal

Pdeflection boxes. The saturated steam leaves the drum apex through
a steam dryer (demister) that enhances the removal of liquid drop-
lets entrained in the vapour stream. However, the saturated steam
flowing into the superheaters may include a small amount of water
droplets. The water remains in the drum bottom and flows through
the downcomers to the evaporator. Pre-warmed feedwater is fed to
the drum through economisers with a certain degree of subcooling
and mixed with the saturated water in the drum. The content of salts
in the pre-warmed feedwater cannot leave with the saturated steam
and remains in the evaporator system. Accordingly, a specific
amount of water is constantly discharged from the drum to the
blow-down tank, limiting the concentration of salts in the evapora-
tion system. The mathematical model that describes the physical
processes in the drum, by contrast to the header model, are
extremely complex. This is due to the fact that the separation of the
two-phase flow takes place under highly-turbulent flow regime. A
schematic of the drum model with all variables is presented in Fig. 6.
PIn the drum model, it can be assumed that the momentum trans-
ported into the drum with the inlet flows is completely dissipated,
but it builds up again at the pipes, when the working fluid leaves the
drum. For the definition of the drum, the volume Vdru, the height
Hdru and the cross-sectional area Adru are required. The mass of the
water and the steam in the drum can be expressed as:

mliq;dru

D rliq;druAliq;druldru

ð2:78Þ

PHere, the symbol Aliq,dru denotes the cross-sectional area of the
drum filled with water, rliq,dru and rst,dru are the densities of water
and steam in saturation state. A feedwater control valve is used to
regulate the level of the water in the drum ldru by adjusting the feed-
water mass flow rate entering into the drum (see Fig. 15). According
to mass and energy flows at inlet and outlet of the drum, the follow-

Pcan be applied. In the equations, the subscripts k, j, n represent
the number of the feedwater pipes, the number of the risers and
the number of downcommers that are connected to the drum,
respectively. The inlet mass flows are the feedwater mass flow
from economisers _mfw and water/steam mixture mass flow from
the riser _mriser. The outlet mass flows are the water mass flow to
downcomers _mdown and the water mass flow to blow-down tank
_mblow as well as the steam mass flow leaving at the drum apex _mst.
The pressure derivative appears in the energy equation, since the
internal energy of the water or the steam is replaced with the cor-
responding total enthalpy h0. The time derivatives in the mass and
energy balance equations can be approximated by using a suitable
numerical solution method.

P2.3.3.3. Separator.
PThe separator (generally called as cyclone) is a
vertical, cylindrical shaped tank with a relative small diameter and
high wall thickness (see Fig. 7). It is located at the evaporator outlet
of once-through boilers with part load recirculation or with super-
imposed circulation. The once-through boilers can be operated at
subcritical and supercritical pressures and offer a higher degree of
operational flexibility. In the once-through boiler with superim-
posed circulation, the circulation number amounts to around 1.3
(cid:1)1.7 and therefore the separator is used to separate the water from
the water/steam mixture during operation. In the once-through
boiler with part load recirculation, the working fluid is forced to
flow through all heat exchangers in a single pass. Here, the separator
is used to remove the water droplets within the steam flow and
to separate the water from the water/steam mixture only during
start-up procedures and at low part loads. If the boiler is operated at
supercritical pressure, no phase separation can take place. The work-
ing principle of the separator is that the two-phase mixture enters
tangentially into the separator, leading to a spiral flow of the gas
phase. The water droplets in the stream are centrifuged to the sepa-
rator wall, where they move downwards and are collected in the
separator storage tank. The clean steam leaves through the upper
part of the cyclone. Based on the drum model, the following applies

P2.3.3.4. Feedwater storage tank.
PThe feedwater pumped into the
steam generator is typically supplied from a heated container with
thick walls known as feedwater storage tank. The feedwater storage

Ptank stores the feedwater in order to decouple the feedwater mass
flow rate from the build-up of condensate. Generally, the storage
capacity is designed to cover a few minutes of full-load operation of
the boiler. This stored energy can be used effectively in order to yield
a rapid increase of the electrical power output (condensate throt-
tling method). Here, the steam extraction valves to the low pressure
preheaters and the condensate valve to the feedwater tank are tem-
porarily throttled or even closed. Accordingly, the extraction steam
passes through the last turbine stages, resulting in a sudden increase
in the electrical power output (up to 5% within 30 s) that can lasts
for a few minutes depending on the volume of the feedwater storage
tank and/or the condenser tank. The condensate throttling method,
although it has no impact on the main steam pressure, has compli-
cated dynamic behaviour, since it results in the variations of extrac-
tion steam flows as well as the level change of the feedwater storage
tank.

PIn thermal power plants, the feedwater storage tank is equipped
with a deaerator that removes the dissolved oxygen, carbon dioxide
and other gases from the feedwater. Dissolved oxygen in feedwater
reacts with metallic walls and forms oxides (rust). This in turn leads
to serious corrosion damages in the steam generator components. If
carbon dioxide is also present, then it combines with water to form
carbonic acid that causes additional corrosion. The feedwater stor-
age tank and deaerator are modelled as hydraulic accumulators. In
steady state modelling, the mass balance of the storage is simplified
to equalisation of the inflow and the outflow. In transient case, the
mass balance of the storage can be expressed as:

P2.3.4. Turbomachines

PTurbomachines are a vital part of every energy system. They
transfer energy between a rotor and a fluid (gas or liquid). The
energy transfer can take place from rotor to fluid (e.g. compressor,
fan and pump) or from fluid to rotor (e.g. steam and gas turbines).
Modern turbomachines have smaller gaps between rotor and hous-
ing for minimising the leakage loss. In the pump, the pressure of an
incompressible fluid is increased to a higher level, while the pressure
of a compressible fluid is increased using the compressor. According
to ASME, fans differ from blowers and compressors by the pressure
ratio that can be achieved (up to 1.1 for fans, from 1.11 to 1.2 for
blowers and more than 1.2 for compressors). In a steam turbine, the
superheated or reheated steam expands, resulting in mechanical
work. The gas turbine with its combustion chamber is a combustion
system, converting natural gas or liquid fuels to mechanical energy.
In process simulation, turbomachines are integrated into the water/
steam cycle, the electrical system and in the automation system.
This allows designer to evaluate their electric power consumption/

PThe compressor

P2.3.4.1. Compressor.
is a turbomachine that
low
increases the pressure and the enthalpy of compressible,
density fluids. The pressure increase is characterised by the com-
pressor pressure ratio that describes the ratio of the outlet pres-
sure (discharge pressure) to the inlet pressure (suction pressure).
Compressors are classified according to two different
types,
namely intermittent flow (positive displacement) and continuous
flow (rotor dynamic). The intermittent flow compressors include
rotary compressor and reciprocating compressor, while the con-
tinuous flow compressors include centrifugal compressor and
two rotors
axial compressor. Rotary compressors consist of
within a casing. The reciprocating compressors increase the pres-
sure by reducing the volume of the working fluid. This can be
carried out by a piston within a cylinder as the compressing and
displacing element, achieving high compression ratios. The cen-
trifugal compressors convert angular momentum transferred by
a set of rotating impeller blades (dynamic displacement) to the
working fluid. The axial compressors use arrays of aerofoils to
compress the working fluid. An axial air compressor is one of the
main components of the combined-cycle power plant. It com-
presses and supplies the fresh atmospheric air to the combustion
chamber of the gas turbine. Relevant input data for the compres-
sor model include the dimensions of components, design point
values for pressure and temperature before compressor, pressure
ratio, rotation speed, characteristic curve and efficiency. Basically,
the compressor model has one inlet flow and one outlet flow and

Pcombustion chamber and the cooler ambient air. Without the
induced-draft fan, excess pressure may prevail in the combustion
chamber, which should generally be prevented for safety reason
due to the flue gas leakage.

PIn the fan models, the input data of the fan such as geometry,
dimension, characteristic curve, mechanical coupling must be speci-
fied. Furthermore, the automation and electrical systems for starting
and stopping the motor as well as for controlling the inlet guide
vanes can be modeled, if necessary.

P2.3.4.3. Blower.
PThe blower is used instead of the fan, when higher
pressure ratio (approximately 1.11 (cid:1)1.2) is required. In process sim-
ulation, the mathematical model of the fan can be used for the
blower.

P2.3.4.4. Pump.
PWhile the compressor is designed for compressible
low density flow such as air or gas, a pump is designed to
increase the pressure of incompressible fluids such as water or
oil. In the pump, the mechanical energy of the shaft is trans-
formed into kinetic and potential energy of the flow. At several
locations in the thermal power plant, the pumps are used to
transport the working fluid from one location to another. For
example, the condensate pumps move the condensate water
through the low pressure preheaters into the feedwater storage
tank. The boiler feedwater pump forces the water from the feed-
water tank to flow through high pressure preheaters before
entering the steam generator.

PThe pump model can include mechanical coupling, motor and
busbar. The automation system adjusts the rotation speed of the
pump by frequency control or directly by aid of the mechanical cou-
pling. The steady state operation of a pump is computed as a func-
_

P2.3.4.2. Fan.
PA fan generates a pressure difference, allowing for a
large mass flow rate of air or gas to overcome a flow resistance. The
drive power required is supplied by a rotating shaft (generally an
electric motor). Basically, it can be distinguished between centrifugal
flow and axial flow fans. In the axial fan, the fluid flows axially along
the fan shaft without any change in the flow direction. In the centrif-
ugal fan, the fluid changes its direction relative to the shaft (forward
curved, backward curved or radial).

PIn thermal power plants, the fans used are forced-draft and
induced-draft fans. The forced-draft fan is located at the inlet of
the flue gas path, while the induced-draft fan is located at the
outlet of the flue gas path. The forced-draft fan supplies fresh air
for the combustion chamber via air preheaters. The induced-draft
fan creates a certain amount of negative pressure in the combus-
tion chamber (the pressure is below atmospheric pressure) by
sucking the flue gas through the stack into the atmosphere. For
this purpose, old thermal power plants use only the stack draft,
the density difference between the hot flue gas in the
i.e.

PThe initial values required for the pump model are maximum
pump head Hmax, nominal pump head Hnom, nominal volumetric
_
flow rate

of the pump can be controlled by automation and electrical systems.

steam to mechanical energy. The model of the steam turbine
calculates the enthalpy after the turbine module using the
enthalpy before the turbine, the efficiency and the nominal val-
ues. The mechanical power produced by the turbine is com-
puted and transferred to the generator model. The steam
turbine model may describe the turbine either with a single tur-
bine stage or with many stages in order to consider the steam
extractions.

PThe pressure and enthalpy drops over the turbine are added as
source terms in momentum and energy equations. The pressure
change in the turbine stage is specified at nominal load and com-
puted using the Stodola equation at part loads. The pressure drop is
a function of nominal mass flow rate _mnom, the nominal pressure at
the turbine inlet pinl,nom and the nominal pressure at the turbine out-
let pout,nom:

P2.3.4.6. Gas turbine.
PIn addition to compressor, combustion chamber
and steam generator, the gas turbine represents the core element of
a combined-cycle power plant (CCPP). The gas turbine (GT) converts
flue gas enthalpy to mechanical energy, driving an electrical genera-
tor that produces electrical energy. Using a heat recovery steam gen-
erator (HRSG), the waste heat of the gas turbine can be used to
generate steam and drive a steam turbine. Typically, gas turbines
can be operated with different fuels, including nature gas, crude oil
and biogas. They can extend their fuel range to cover biomass and
coal through the application of integrated gasification combined-
cycle (IGCC). Modern gas turbines can reach their nominal load
within 20 min, while 70% of the nominal flue gas temperature and
60% of the nominal flue gas mass flow are already achieved approxi-
mately 7 min after the start.

PBy contrast to steam turbines, heavy-duty gas turbines with high
inlet temperature require cooling of the first blade rows. If the cool-
ing is not required, the mathematical model of the gas turbine is
similar to the steam turbine. In case of air cooling, the entire gas tur-
bine has to be divided into many stages. The cooling air of one stage
is mixed with the combustion gases and can be considered in the
mass balance equation of the turbine stage. Based on empirical data,
Wang and Leithner [181] developed an formula to calculate the cool-
ing air mass flow required at nominal load:

P2.3.5. Additional components

PDetailed modelling of conventional

thermal power plants
requires, besides the above mentioned process components, addi-
tional components such as different firing systems, mills and flue
gas clearing devices, e.g. electrostatic precipitator and selective cata-
lytic reduction unit. Furthermore, there is an increased attention on
hybrid power plants that combine different technologies to produce
electrical power. As a result, the dynamic simulation programmes
must extend their existing libraries with new models for wind tur-
bines, solar and fuel cells applications. Examples of hybrid systems

Pare the integrated solar combined-cycle power plant (ISCC) and the
hybrid fuel cell/gas turbine power plant.

Pvolume fraction of solid is constant, while the volume fraction of
solid in the lean region decreases exponentially with height.

P2.3.5.1. Combustion chamber.
PThe combustion of the fossil fuel takes
place in the combustion chamber. The combustion chamber model
has oxidiser inlet (generally air or oxygen), fuel inlet (such as coal,
oil or gas) and flue gas outlet. Compared to combustion process of
liquid or gaseous fuels, the combustion of solid fuels (coal, biomass
or municipal solid waste) is more complex, including three major
mechanisms: drying, pyrolysis and oxidation. The flue gas formed
during combustion consists generally of O2, N2, CO2, H2O, SO2 and
Ar. The combustion calculation that predicts the composition of the
flue gas requires the type of fossil fuel, the fuel mass flow rate, the
Air/fuel ratio, temperature etc. Determining the exact composition is
of high relevance for defining the material properties of the flue gas.
The mass flow balance in the combustion chamber can be expressed
as:
_mout;fg

C _minl;fuel

D _minl;air

ð2:110Þ

and accordingly the energy balance is written as:
_mout;fghout;fg

C _minl;fuelLHVfuel

D _minl;airhinl;air

ð2:111Þ

PHere, the subscript fg refers to flue gas and the term LHV is the
lower heating value of the fuel. In addition to the mass and energy
balances, a balance equation for each substance is solved. Usually,
the combustion chamber is operated under atmospheric pressure
like in pulverised coal and incineration power plants. On the con-
trary, the combustion chamber of a gas turbine is pressurised.

P2.3.5.2. Fluidized bed.
PThe fluidized bed is a bulk of solid particles
located in a vertical vessel and the gas or liquid flows from the bot-
tom via a porous plate or nozzles. The gas-solid fluidized bed is char-
acterised by several advantages such as high heat and mass transfer
rates, resulting in uniform temperature gradients in the bed even
with highly exothermic or endothermic reactions. Practical applica-
tions of fluidized bed reactors include CO2 capture in thermal power
plants by chemical or carbonate looping process as well as solid fuels
conversion, including gasification and combustion of coal, biomass
and even fuel mixtures. Depending on the superficial fluidization
velocity, it can basically be distinguished between fixed bed, station-
ary fluidized bed and circulating fluidized bed. The fluidized bed can,
generally, be divided into a dense phase zone and a lean zone. In the
dense zone, there is a higher concentration of solids near the air dis-
tributor plate. It can be differentiated here between two phases: the
emulsion phase (uniform mixing of gas and solids) and the bubble
phase (only gas). The dense zone is followed with the lean zone, in
which the concentration of solids decreases sharply as the flow
moves upwards.

PBasically, there are two different numerical approaches for the
representation of gas(cid:1)solid flow in the fluidized bed (Euler(cid:1)Euler
and Euler(cid:1)Lagrange). In the Euler(cid:1)Euler method, also known as
two(cid:1)fluid method, each phase is regarded as a continuum and is
mathematically calculated by solving the balance equations. The
Euler(cid:1)Lagrange approach combines the continuum descriptions of
fluid phase with the Lagrange representation of dispersed phase on
the basis of Newton's transport equations. Although these numerical
models described here are already implemented in 3D simulation
programmes such as ANSYS-FLUENT (among others publications
[183,184]), OpenFOAM and CPFD-BARRACUDA (among others publi-
cations [185(cid:1)188]), they are not suitable for 1D process pro-
grammes used to simulate the entire thermal power plant system.
Therefore, semi-empirical models such as Kunii and Levenspiel
[189] are preferred by reason of low computational cost. In this
model, the fluidized bed is divided into two regions (dense and lean
regions), interacting each other based on several assumptions. The
dense region describes the lower part of the rector, where the

P2.3.5.3. Fuel cell.
PA fuel cell converts chemical energy into electricity
and forms water. The fuel cell has two electrodes, namely anode and
cathode. Generally, hydrogen is the basic fuel, but fuel cells can also
extend their fuel range to cover methane. There are four different
types of fuel cells, including molten carbonate (MCFC), solid oxide
(SOFC), phosphoric acid (PAFC) and proton exchange membrane
(PEM). The selection of the fuel cell type depends on the specific
application; whether large or small scale, stationary or mobile.

PThe modelling of a fuel cell requires the consideration of chemi-
cal reactions and additional components involved. For example, the
simulation model of a solid oxide fuel cell includes a natural gas
reformer and a sulphur removal unit. The fuel cell model is con-
nected on the one hand to the process components such as pipe or
valve, supplying it with reactants such as air and fuel and discharg-
ing products such as water. On the other hand, it is connected to the
electrical system (electrical source). The voltage of the fuel cell is
used as boundary condition for the electrical system, while the elec-
tric current of the electrical network is transferred to the fuel cell
calculation and applied as input. Further information regarding the
dynamic modelling of fuel cells can be found in the literature, for
example in [190,191].

P2.3.5.4. Weather.
PAmong renewable energy sources, solar energy
offers a promising option for electricity generation in the countries
with high solar radiation. Solar technologies can be divided into con-
centrating solar power (CSP) and photovoltaic cells (PV). In the lat-
ter, the sunlight is directly converted into electrical energy using
semiconducting materials. In CSP, the sunlight of a large area is con-
centrated using mirrors or lenses onto absorber tubes, through
which a heat transfer fluid (generally oil or water) passes. The ther-
mal energy stored in the heat transfer fluid is used as a heat source
for a power generation system. This should not be confused with
concentrator photovoltaics, a technology that directs concentrated
sunlight to photovoltaic cells. Concentrated solar power plants are
showing increasing interest in field of research and application,
mostly as parabolic trough collectors and solar tower collectors. This
is due to the fact that the CSP technology can easily be coupled with
thermal energy storage and with fossil fuel combustion system,
increasing the plant availability, especially during low radiation
periods. However, the daily and monthly variation of the solar radia-
tion is a main drawback.

PThe solar radiation module considers the variation of solar radia-
tion at different periods of day. It calculates the solar position and
both beam and diffusive irradiation on the horizontal surface accord-
ing to input parameters such as geometric coordinates of the field,
time, elevation from sea level and clear sky index. The data from
solar radiation module can be used to determine the total amount of
irradiation that is passed to different types of surfaces with different
angles of inclination. The direct irradiance received per unit area by
a surface normal to the sun is defined as direct normal irradiance
(DNI). Using DNI values obtained from weather stations at the loca-
tion, the absorbed solar energy by an absorber tube can be computed
as follows:

Sabsorb

with the mirror aperture area Aaper and the incidence angle u. The
symbol hopt represents the optical efficiency and Etrack is a tracking
error. The reduction in the absorption energy due to several factors
can also be considered, including dust on the absorber glass cover
fdust, mirror cleanliness fclean, row shadowing frow,shad and end-losses
fend ¡ loss caused by spacing between solar collector elements, spacing
between solar collector assembly as well as the non-zero incidence
angle. When the angle of incidence increases, losses that can arise

corrected by the incidence angle modifier (IAM).

P2.3.5.5. Mill.
PMills are mechanical devices used to break different
types of solid materials in small pieces by grinding, crushing or cut-
ting. In pulverised coal-fired power plants, a pulveriser coal mill
grinds the raw coal into a combustible dust. Here, the coal particles
are dried by flue gas or hot air and milled to fine size, so that stable
combustion and complete burn-out of pulverised coal can be
achieved in the combustion chamber. The coal properties such as
volatile components, ash content, hardness, humidity and grinding
fineness are the decisive factor for selecting the required mill. Basi-
cally, coal pulverisers can be divided into three assembly groups,
impact mills, gravity-force mills and external force mills. The impact
mills such as hammer and beater wheel mills are classified as high
speed mills. While the hammer mill is suitable for lignite and hard
coal, the beater wheel mill is preferred for lignite, but can be used
conditionally for hard coal. The gravity-force mills are low speed
mills and well suited for wet and hard coal. Due to their construc-
tion, they are identified as tube mills. When considering the design
of external force mills, different constructions are well-known such
as bowl mill and roller mill. In such medium speed mills, the grind-
ing bowl is rotated by a gearbox, while the grinding parts are pressed
by external force either by springs or hydraulic cylinders against the
grinding track. The external force mills are suitable for harder coals,
showing different advantages such as high grinding performance,
low wear and low power consumption.

PAlthough the dynamic of the mill has a significant influence on
dynamic behaviour of the entire coal-fired power plant, the mill is,
generally, modelled as a mixing point of the coal and the primary air
for purposes of simplification. In this mixing point, the water content
of the coal is evaporated under the assumption that no combustion
will take place. If it is required, complex pulveriser models, e.g.
[192(cid:1)194] can also be applied to achieve accurate dynamic behav-
iour of pulverised coal-fired power plants.

PParticulate matter, nitrogen oxides (NOx),
P2.3.5.6. Flue gas control.
sulphur oxides (SOx) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions emitted by
the combustion of fossil fuels contribute to global climate change
and might present a hazard for health and environment. The energy
system in terms of conversion of fossil fuels as a major emission
source is in the focus of attention. Flue gas cleaning systems are
therefore considered as an essential part of modern thermal power
plants.

PFossil fuels, except natural gas, contain non-combustibles that
form the majority of the particulate in the flue gas such as ash and
some amount of unburned carbon. Particulate control equipment is
therefore required to remove particulate, keep the particulate from
re-entering the flue gas and discharge the collected material. Differ-
ent types of particulate control equipment are available, including
electrostatic precipitators, fabric filters, mechanical collectors and
venturi scrubbers.

PThe term NOx denotes cumulative emissions of nitric oxide (NO),
nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and other nitrogen-bearing species. In ther-
mal power plants, there are three principal mechanisms of NOx for-
mation, namely thermal NOx, fuel-bound NOx and prompt NOx. A
reduction in NOx emissions can be achieved using primary and sec-
ondary techniques. The primary measures for NOx aim to reduce
both peak temperature and residence time at peak temperature,
including fuel/air staging, over fire air, less excess air, flue gas recir-
culation and combustion optimisation. The secondary techniques
are based on chemical reduction of NOx such as selective catalytic
reduction (SCR) and selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR).

PMost sulphur emitted to the atmosphere oxidizes slowly to sul-
phur dioxide (SO2) that is a reactive and acid gas. In the combustion
of fossil fuels, large quantities of SO2 are emitted. For SO2 control,

Ptwo strategies can be generally applied, either the use of low sulphur
coal or installing scrubbers. Commercialised technologies for sul-
phur scrubbing include wet, semidry and dry processes. For thermal
power plants, the technology of choice is the wet flue gas desulfuri-
zation (WFGD) scrubber and in case of lower sulphur oxides emis-
sions is the dry flue gas desulfurization (DFGD).

PA promising method to reduce CO2 emissions is the carbon cap-
ture and storage (CCS). Depending on the manner of CO2 capture
and the oxidation of fuel, it is distinguished between three CO2 cap-
ture methods, namely pre-combustion, post-combustion and oxy-
fuel.
In the pre-combustion approach, the carbon dioxide is
separated before the combustion process. The coal is gasified in a
first step at higher pressure levels and the syngas consists essen-
tially of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. In a subsequent water-gas
shift reaction, the carbon monoxide reacts under the supply of
steam to carbon dioxide and additional hydrogen. The flue gas in
the post(cid:1)combustion process, which is basically consists of nitro-
gen, oxygen, carbon dioxide and steam, is further treated. Here, dif-
ferent concepts are developed such as the chemical scrubbing of
flue gas (among others, Diao et al. [195]) and the carbonate(cid:1)loop-
ing process (among others, Str€ohle et al. [196]). In the third method
(the oxyfuel process), the coal is combusted with pure oxygen.
After cleaning the flue gas from pollutants and separation of the
steam by a condensation process, the flue gas consists of pure CO2
that can be compressed for transport and storage. Due to the provi-
sion of the pure oxygen using an air separation unit, there is an
enormous loss of overall efficiency of 8(cid:1)14 percentage points
[197]. The combustion of solid fuels by means of the chemi-
cal(cid:1)looping process, a new combustion concept, enables a CO2 cap-
ture with low energy input. Here, air and fuel are kept separate, and
the oxygen is transferred from the air to the fuel by use of an oxy-
gen(cid:1)carrier material. Generally, particles containing a suitable
metal oxide are used as oxygen(cid:1)carriers and these particles are
moved between two coupled, circulated gas(cid:1)solid fluidized beds
(air reactor and fuel reactor). In an ideal case, the flue gas at the
fuel reactor outlet consists of CO2 and H2O. The latter can be easily
removed by condensation [198,199].

PFor the modelling of flue gas cleaning devices (dust removal, NOx
removal, SOx removal and CO2 capture), the standard library compo-
nents of dynamic simulation programmes are generally insufficient
apart from a few exceptions (e.g. ASPEN Plus DYNAMICS). Therefore,
simple numerical models are used, in which the flue gas cleaning
systems such as electrostatic precipitator and selective catalytic
reduction unit are modelled as pressure drops and thermal masses.
Thus, detailed models of flue gas cleaning components should be the
subject of further research.

P2.3.6. Examples

PIn the previous sections, different process components such as
thin-walled and thick-walled tubes as well as turbomachines are
presented. Base modelling of thermal power plants is carried out by
selecting the process components and combining them to generate a
model of an existing system and/or a new process for research.
Although the building of a model is generally limited by the program
libraries, a specific component may be modelled by combining vari-
ous existing process components. All necessary specifications can be
inserted in the components that are linked by flows of either mate-
rial, energy or heat properties to finish construction. Here, two dif-
ferent examples are selected from the scientific literature, showing
detailed dynamic models of a combined-cycle power plant built in
ASPEN PLUS DYNAMICS [38] and a pulverised coal-fired power plant
built in APROS and in MODELICA [21,53].

PIn Fig. 8, a combined-cycle power plant model that comprises a
gas turbine connected to a vertical gas path is illustrated. The heat
recovery steam generator that is arranged downstream of the gas
turbine is unfired. The water/steam circuit is a three-pressure-stage

Pwith forced circulation in the HP, IP and LP evaporator paths and
reheater section after the high pressure turbine. Process components
used to build the model are: heat exchangers, drums, pumps, tur-
bines, pipes, valves and attemperator. Furthermore, different con-
trollers and electrical components are used. The LP feedwater
directed to the LP economiser is supplied by the condensate pump.
A control valve for the LP drum level is located between the LP econ-
omiser outlet and the LP drum and the heated water flows into the
LP drum. In the LP drum, the water circulates through the LP evapo-
rator tube bundle, where it is heated by the gas turbine exhaust gas
and converted into saturated steam. The saturated water in the LP
drum is separated and a significant portion of the flow is directed
into the HP and IP circuits via high and intermediate boiler feed
pumps (HP BFP and IP BFP). The dry steam exits the LP drum and
flows through the LP superheater. After leaving the superheater, the
superheated steam enters the LP turbine. Process water is extracted
from the LP circuit for fuel gas preheating, before it is returned to
the condenser.

PThe feedwater flows into the HP drum via the HP economisers.
The water in the HP drum circulates through the HP evaporator with
the help of the forced circulation pump (HP RP). The recirculated
water is heated by the flue gas and converted into saturated steam
in the HP drum. While the liquid stays in the drum and mixes with
water coming from the HP economisers, the steam exits the drum
and flows to the HP superheaters. The steam flows through the high
pressure superheaters, where it absorbs additional heat from the
flue gas. The HP superheated steam exits the HRSG and enters the
HP turbine section. A high pressure attemperator is provided at the
inlet of the last superheater to control the temperature at the inlet of
the HP turbine. The water for the HP attemperator is taken from the
high pressure feedwater pump. The high pressure feedwater mass
flow is controlled by the HP drum level control valve that is located
upstream of the HP economisers. Generally, the analogue structure
applies to the IP circuit.

PIn Fig. 9, a pulverised coal-fired power plant is modelled using
two dynamic simulation programmes APROS and MODELICA. The
power plant consists of an air/flue gas system and a water/steam
system. In the steam generator, the chemically bond energy of the
coal is converted into heat that is transferred from the flue gas side
to the water/steam circuit and used to generate steam for a Rankine
cycle.

PIn the water/steam system, the feedwater enters the economiser
(ECO) at the top of the steam generator. The water is then directed
to the membrane wall evaporator, where the evaporation takes
place. Due the once-through design the evaporation zone is not
defined and the two-phase region is load dependent. For low part
load operation, during start-up or shut-down, a forced circulation is
in operation. A cyclone is installed to separate the water droplets
within the steam flow and a separator storage tank is used for phase
separation. The circulation is forced by a circulation pump (CP) and
the level is controlled by a circulation control valve. The circulated
mass flow re-enters the steam generator at the economiser inlet.
The produced steam, saturated or partly superheated, enters the
steam cooled supporting tube system (superheater 1) of the con-
vective heat exchangers and flows downwards to the super-
heater 2 (platen superheater). After the platen superheater, the
steam flows through superheaters 3 and 4. In between the super-
heaters, three attemperator stages are arranged for steam tem-
perature control. The reheater
is divided into two heat
exchangers and has one attemperator. The steam leaves the
once-through steam generator and flows through the high pres-
sure turbine before re-entering the steam generator via the
reheater. Afterwards the steam fully expands in one intermediate
turbine and two low pressure turbines to condenser pressure.
The condensed water is fed through seven feedwater preheaters
back to the steam generator.

PIn the air/flue gas system, the primary air is supplied by two
speed controlled radial fans and flows through the regenerative
air preheater into the mill (pulverizer). The coal dust is entrained
with air, fed into the furnace and burned. The secondary air is
supplied by two parallel forced draft fans, which are specified as
axial fans with variable blade angle. Afterwards the secondary air
passes a steam coil air preheater and the regenerative air
preheater, before entering the furnace. In order to consider the
false air, which is impossible to avoid in a balanced-draft system,
ambient air is introduced at the hopper of the steam generator
and adjusted for the nominal case. After exiting the steam genera-
tor, the now 350(cid:1)400 °C hot flue gas flows through the selective
catalytic reduction, the regenerative air preheater, the electro-
static precipitator and the induced draft fan that keeps the fur-
nace at a slight negative pressure.

2.4. Automation system

PIn dynamic simulation, the selection of suitable control structures
is essential in order to accurately describe the behaviour of thermal
power plants during transients. The automation components,
explained below according to Refs. [169,200,201], include measuring
devices, analogue and binary modules, signal sources and control-
lers.

P2.4.1. Measurement modules

PMeasuring devices collect data on the physical properties and
transmit them in analogue signals. The output signal of a measuring
device can be used as an input signal for a control structure or for
other purposes such as operation monitoring or data recording. Mea-
suring values from thermal power plants include but are not limited
to pressures, temperatures, mass flow rates and levels.

PThe pressure and temperature measurement modules can be
applied to record the pressure and temperature of different process
components such as points, tanks, headers, pipes, etc.

PIt should be mentioned that measurements devices may cause a
pressure drop in the flow. This pressure drop is typically not consid-
ered in measurement modules and can be considered separately, if
required.

P2.4.2. Analogue modules

PAnalogue modules are used to modify analogue signals. In these
modules, the output signal is always analogue, but in addition to the
analogue input signal, a binary signal may be found for controlling
tasks. The analogue modules can be divided in three groups, namely
basic, static and dynamic modules. These are explained in detail in
the following sections.

P2.4.2.1. Basic modules.
PAnalog basic modules are adder, multiplier,
divider, mean value, setpoint and signal splitter (see Fig. 10). The
adder module is applied to add or subtract the signals yinl,1,yinl,2 and
yinl, i. The output signal yout is calculated according to the equation:

PThe symbol N represents the number of input signals.
PThe term “setpoint” refers to the target value of a variable. The set-
point module may have two operation modes (normal and tracking).
In normal operation, the output signal is constant. For example, the
control system of the boiler aims to maintain the steam temperature
at inlet of the steam turbine at a constant temperature setpoint. In the
tracking operation, the output signal is not constant and follows the
value of the input signal either immediately or with a given gradient.

PThe signal splitter divides the same signal in two information
flows. The input signal is yinl and the outlet signals areyout,1 and yout,2.

P2.4.2.2. Static modules.
PAnalogue static modules include delay,
memory, switch, dead band, hysteresis, limiter, Max and Min selec-
tor, polyline and square root (see Fig. 11). Some of the static modules
such as dead band and limiter are a source of discontinuity, which in
return may result in numerical instability of the simulation.

PA delay module shifts the given value of an input signal yinl by a

time constant T. The outlet signal yout is expressed as:

ð2:122Þ

PThe memory module is used as memory for an analogue signal
value. The module has an analogue input signal, an analogue output
signal and a binary input signal. If the binary input signal has the
value FALSE, the output signal value is equal to the input signal
value. If the binary input value is changed to TRUE, the value of the
output signal is fixed and remains independent of the input signal
value changes.

PThe switch module can be considered as selector between two
analogue signals. It has two analogue input signals, a binary input
signal and an analogue output signal. The output signal follows the
first input signal, if the binary input is TRUE and follows the second
input signal, if the binary input is FALSE. This can be described math-
ematically with the help of the following equation:

Psmaller than the defined dead band value (DB), the output signal is
equal to zero. If the input signal value is bigger than DB, the output
signal is the input signal value minus the dead band value. If the
input signal value is less than the negative dead band value (¡DB),
the output value is then the sum of the input signal value and the
dead band value. These relations are expressed by the following
equation:

PThe hysteresis module is used to form a hysteresis effect to an
analogue signal. The value of the output signal will follow the input
signal, so long as the value of the input signal is changing to the
same direction. If the direction changes, then the value of the output
signal is held constant as long as the total change to that new direc-
tion is smaller than the defined hysteresis value.

PA limiter limits the signal yinl within a predefined range using a
high limit value Lhigh and a low limit value Llow. If the value of the
input signal is between the given limits, the value of the output sig-
nal follows the value of the input signal. These can be expressed as:

PThe Max and Min modules are signal selectors. The value of the
output signal is equal to the highest value of the input signals in case
of a Max operator and is the smallest value of the input signals in
case of a Min operator. The equation for maximum value selection

Pfor two input signal is:

ð2:127Þ

PThe function module can be used to form a polyline (n-point
cross line curve) between two variables. The value of the output
signal is a function of the input signal and the given polyline.
The polyline will be defined by a set of (x, y) coordinate pairs. If
the input signal value is out of the range of the defined x coordi-
nates, the value of the output signal equals the function value of
the last x coordinate.

PThe square root module returns a square root of an input signal

value. The output signal is expressed as:

P2.4.2.3. Dynamic modules.
dient, integrator, differentiator, derivator and filter.

PAnalogue dynamic modules include gra-

PThe gradient module limits the rate of variation for a variable.
The rate of variation can be limited separately for increase and for
decrease direction. The value of the output signal follows the
changes of the input signal considering the defined gradient limits.
The value of the output signal is the same as the input, if the change
in the input signal is slower than the defined gradient or the input
signal does not change.

PThe integrator and differentiator modules are simple control com-
ponents. The output value of an integrator module can be expressed as:

Pis in TRUE state. The output signal is only FALSE, if all input signals
are in FALSE state.

PThe rate of change of the output value is determined according to
the given integration time Tint and the value of the input signal. If
the input signal is positive, the output value is increasing. If the value
of the input signal is negative, the output value is decreasing. The
output value remains constant, when the input value is zero. For
example, if the integration time is set to 60 s and the input signal is
1.0, the output value will increase to 1.0 within 1 min.

PThe differentiator module can be represented as first-order ordi-
nary differential equation. The rate of change of the output value is
calculated according to the given derivation time Tder and the value
of the input signal yinl as:

yout D Tder

dyinl
dt

ð2:130Þ

PThe derivator module defines the rapid changes of a variable.
The output signal of the derivator depends on the derivation time
and the derivation gain. The latter calculates the height of the
impulse, while the derivation time determines the duration of the
impulse. Using these parameters, it is possible to define the step
response of the derivator module. If the value of the input signal
does not change (steady state case), the value of the output signal
is zero.

PThe filter module performs a filtering operation on an analogue
signal. The value of the output signal is determined according to the
input signal value and the filter parameters. The simplest filter is a
moving average filter. The only parameter in this case is the time
constant of the filter Tfil.

P2.4.3. Binary modules

PBinary modules (Boolean logic elements) are required for
selection purposes in many control circuits. In such modules, the
input can be binary or/and analogue signals, while the output is
always binary. Therefore, when an expression is evaluated by
binary modules, the output signal is ether zero or unity (zero
means FALSE and unity means TRUE). The most relevant binary
modules used in the dynamic simulation of thermal power plants
are explained below.

P2.4.3.1. Basic modules.
PIn Fig. 12, basic binary modules (AND, OR and
NOT) are depicted. The logical operator “AND” is applied in order to
perform a logical operation AND for binary signals. The output signal
is TRUE, when all input signals are in TRUE state. If one of the input
signals is in FALSE state, the output signal is FALSE.

nal.

P2.4.3.2. Advanced modules.
PThe advanced binary modules include,
among others, delay, switch, n/m selector, flip-flop, limit value
checker, button, alarm and timer (see Fig. 13).

PThe delay module shifts a binary signal in time. It has one binary
input signal and one binary output signal. The output signal will fol-
low the input signal after a given delay time, which can be constant
or varied by an analogue signal. Mathematically, this relation can be
written as follows:
(cid:3)
(cid:1)
(cid:3)
D yinl t¡DT tð Þ
yout t; DT tð Þ

ð2:134Þ

(cid:1)

PThe switch module is a selector between two binary signals. It
has two input binary signals, an output binary signal and an input
binary control signal. The state of the output signal follows the state
of either of the two input signals depending on the control signal.

yinl;1 case ycon D 1

ð2:135Þ

PThe n/m selector is a logical selector module for binary signals.
The symbol m denotes the number of input signals, while the symbol
n is a given positive integer. The output signal is TRUE, when at least
n number of input signals are in TRUE state. Otherwise, the output
signal is in FALSE state.

PThe flip-flop is a bistable element, i.e. it has two stable states. The
flip-flop module can be used as a memory in logical circuits. The
state of the output only can be changed with a TRUE input signal,
either SET or RESET signal. The output signal is:

P(cid:3) FALSE, if both input signals (SET and RESET) are in FALSE state.
P(cid:3) FALSE, if the RESET input only is in TRUE state.
P(cid:3) FALSE, if both inputs are in TRUE state and the RESET input is

dominating.

P(cid:3) TRUE, if the SET input is in TRUE state.
P(cid:3) TRUE, if both inputs are in TRUE state and the RESET input is not

dominating.

PThe limit value checker compares the analogue input value to a

given limit value LV, resulting in the following output signal:

PThe operator “OR” is used to perform a logical operation OR for
binary signals. The output signal is TRUE, if any of the input signals

P(cid:3) FALSE, if the value of the analogue input signal is greater than the

given limit value.

to an analogue signal. In this case, an additional hysteresis value HV
has to be given. The output signal is:

P(cid:3) FALSE, if the analogue input signal is bigger than the given limit

value plus the half of the hysteresis value.

PA cold junction is a special case of the limit value checker. Here,

of the limit value in case of the conventional module. The output
value is then:

the value of the second analogue input signal.

PThe button module has only an output signal. When the button is
pushed, the output is in TRUE state. After a certain period of time
defined by user, the output value returns to FALSE.

PThe alarm module provides alarms triggered by logical signals. If
the input signal shows the desired value (TRUE or FALSE), the mod-
ule sends an alarm message.

PThe timer module has an inlet and an output signal. When the
inlet signal is set to TURE, the timer starts counting the time and

Pcompares it to a given max time value. The output signal is in FALSE
state, so long as the max time value is not reached. When the max
time value is reached, the output signal is in TRUE state. The timer
module can also be used as an analogue module. In this case, the
time is given as analogue output value. Moreover, the timer can be
reset via a RESET signal.

PThe signal source modules can be applied to define transient set-
points or to generate binary or analogue signals. These include pulse,
noise, sine or cosine wave, square wave and triangular wav genera-
tor (see Fig. 14). The mean value of the output signals for analogue
signal generators is zero. In the signal source modules, the output
signal is a function of time:
yout D f ðtÞ

ð2:139Þ

PThe pulse generator module generates binary pluses. The module
has a binary input signal, an analogue input signal and a binary out-
put signal. When the input signal is FALSE, the output signal is
always in FALSE state. If the input signal is changing from FALSE to
TRUE, the module will generate pulses. Each pulse lasts for half of
the defined period time, which can be constant or varied according
to the analogue input signal.

PThe noise generator module generates random signal with a
constant power spectral density. The module has a binary input
signal that is used to switch off the generator, an analogue input
signal that is used to define a given variance and an analogue
output signal. When the binary input is in FALSE state, the value
of the output signal will be zero. If the generator is switched on,
the module will generate normally distributed white noise of a
given variance.

PThe sine wave generator module generates a sine wave. The
amplitude and the time period of the sine wave can be constant or
varied depending on analogue input signals. A cosine wave has a
shape identical to that of a sine wave, with a phase-shift of p/2 radi-
ans.

PThe square wave generator module generates square waves. It
has one binary input, two analogue inputs for amplitude and the
time period of the generated wave and one analogue output. The
output of the module is zero, if the binary input is in FALSE
state. When the generator is switched on, the module will gener-
ate square waves according to the given amplitude and the time
period that can be constant or varied following the analogue
input signals.

PThe triangular wave generator module generates triangular
waves and can be switched on/off by a binary input signal. The

P2.4.5. Controller modules

PThe well-known control schemes in process and energy systems
are explained briefly below. These include feedback control, feedfor-
ward control, feedforward plus feedback control, cascade control
and cascade plus feedforward control [202]:

P(cid:3) Feedback control scheme: A feedback control system represents
the simplest form of closed loop control scheme. The error signal
resulting from the comparison between the process output and
the setpoint is used as a means for the controller.

P(cid:3) Feedforward control scheme: A feedforward control responses to
the moment when the disturbance occurs. The process variable
adjustment is therefore based on the knowledge of the process
using mathematical model and measurement disturbances with-
out having to wait for a deviation in the process variable. Due to
modeling errors and unmeasured disturbances, a flawless feed-
forward control is not possible and is, generally, used in combi-
nation with a feedback control.

P(cid:3) Feedforward plus feedback control scheme: In this control sys-
tem, the roll of the feedforward controller is to decrease or elimi-
nate the effect of outer disturbances, while the feedback
controller will respond to setpoint variations. Compared to a
feedback control system, this combined control technique can
significantly give better response to a disturbance that can be
measured, before it affects the process output.

P(cid:3) Cascade control with and without feedforward control schemes:
The cascade control consists of two loops, namely an inner loop
and an outer loop. This control scheme leads to the benefits
required, only when the inner loop has faster dynamics as com-
pared to the outer loop [203]. The cascade control is frequently
used within the control circuits of thermal power plants. A com-
bination of cascade and feed-forward control is achieved, in
which the primary and the secondary processes are controlled by
a cascade control, while the disturbance rejection is obtained
using a feedforward control.

PTypical variants of controller used in these control schemes
are P-controller,
I-controller, PI-controller, PD-controller, and
PID-controller. The output of the controller yout is determined
according to the control deviation of the controller and to possi-
ble feedforward input.

PThe parameters KP, TI, TD represent gain, integration time and der-
ivation time of the controller, respectively. In order to obtain a PD or
a PI controller, TI ! 1 or TD D 0 can be specified. In the control
schemes of thermal power plants, the controllers applied are PI and
PID controller. For the determination of controller parameters, sev-
eral tuning methods can be found in the literature, namely stereo-
typical tuning methods and intelligent methods. The stereotypical
tuning methods include Ziegler Nichols, relay auto-tuning, pole
placement and internal model control [204]. The intelligent methods
use fuzzy logic, genetic algorithms, artificial neutral networks and
particle swarm optimization for finding the controller parameters
[205].

PWhich control scheme is more appropriate to control a process, it
cannot be completely stated. For example, feedforward control may
show in some cases better performance than feedback control or
cascade control. A detailed understanding of the invistagted process
and the control theory are therefore required in order to obtain a
physically meaningful operation. Further information can be found
for example in [206,207].

P2.4.6. Examples

PThe control structures consist of various components such as
controllers, analogue and binary components, which are combined
in order to satisfy certain control requirements. In this section, dif-
ferent control structures used in thermal power plants, including
drum level, steam bypass and feedwater control circuits [14,38] are
explained as examples.

PThe three-element level controller is used to adjust the water
level in different power plant components such as feedwater storage
tank, feedwater preheater and drum. In Fig. 15, the three-element
level controller of the drum in a heat recovery steam generator is
illustrated. The controller adjusts the feedwater mass flow rate by
controlling the feedwater valve, which is located between the boiler
feedwater pump and the economisers. The operation algorithm of
the drum level controller is described as follows: on the one hand,
the difference between the feedwater mass flow rate and the steam
mass flow rate d _m is measured. On the other hand, the difference
between the drum level setpoint and the actual value dL is measured.
The deviation of these two paths (d _m, dL) affects a PI-controller. The
PI-controller commands the continuous device control (DC) that oper-
ates the drum level valve. If the pressure in the drum exceeds a certain
value, the deviation (d _m, dL) will be replaced by the pressure difference
between the drum and the maximum pressure setpoint in order to pre-
vent further increase of the drum pressure.

PThe high pressure bypass control circuit used in a combined-
cycle power plant is depicted in Fig. 16. It routes the high pressure
steam, which is not accepted by the high pressure turbine into the
cold reheater. This control circuit is in operation during the power
plant start-up, as long as the high pressure steam quality has not
matched the high pressure turbine requirements. Furthermore, the
high pressure bypass system is used during the steam turbine trip at
any load. A desuperheater has been installed, which cools the steam
behind the high pressure bypass control valve to 50 °C above the sat-
urated steam temperature, before it enters the cold reheater system.
The injection water is delivered from the high pressure feedwater
pump. The main tasks of the high pressure bypass controller are to
insure a smooth build-up of the high pressure during the start-up, to
prevent the high pressure from decreasing during the turbine trip
and to prevent the condensation in the high pressure superheater in
case of a gas turbine load rejection. The principle of the work is as
follows:

P(cid:3) During the start-up procedure, both HP bypass valve (HPBPCV)
and HP main steam valve (HPMSCV) are initially closed. This pro-
cedure enables the pressure in the high pressure circuit to
increase rapidly. When the minimum pressure setpoint is met,
the HP bypass valve starts opening to counteract further rising of
the pressure. Due to the continuous pressure increasing, the
HPBPCV is forward opened.

P(cid:3) After the HP bypass valve is fully open, the steam pressure rises
due to the steam generation increasing. At this stage, the auto-
matic setpoint adjuster is activated. It tracks the bypassed pres-
sure at interval about 1 bar below the high pressure.

P(cid:3) When a specified high pressure is reached, the HPBPCV is throt-
tled to intermediate start position (circa 70%). This process
ensures the high pressure to reach the fixed pressure setpoint
faster. After the fixed pressure is met, the HP bypass valve limita-
tion is switched off to hold the pressure at the fixed value by fur-
ther opening of the HPBPCV.

P(cid:3) When the main steam control valve starts opening, the HP bypass
valve starts closing in the same attitude. If the HPMSCV is fully
opened, then the HPBPCV is closed. The high pressure bypass
valve could be again opened, if the pressure in the high pressure
circuit is increased over a defined setpoint (the nominal pressure
pulse delta p) in order to discharge the high pressure.

P(cid:3) In case of the steam turbine trip, the HP bypass control circuit is
put in operation. While the HPMSCV is immediately closed, the

PHPBPCV controls the high pressure to reach the pressure level,
which was existent before the steam turbine trip. Holding the
pressure at high level has the advantage that the HRSG is already
prepared to the hot restart.

P(cid:3) In case of gas turbine load rejection, the gas turbine exhaust tem-
perature drops very fast to low level. In order to prevent the con-
densation in the high pressure superheater, the HPBPCV will
open to reduce the high pressure to its saturation temperature
below the gas turbine exhaust temperature.

PA schematic representation of the high pressure feedwater
control structure used in a Benson HRSG is illustrated in Fig. 17.
This control circuit offers the possibility to operate the high pres-
sure system in level mode (nature circulation) or Benson mode
(once-through). Furthermore,
it provides a save operation for
heat recovery steam generator during GT transients and fast
start-up procedures. The idea behind the feedwater mass flow
controller is based on the heat of the flue gas that can be
absorbed by HP evaporators (DhFG, EVA) as well as the enthalpies
of the working fluid at inlet and outlet of HP evaporators (DhWS,
EVA). The obtained value is then corrected by the attemperators
mass flows as function of the feedwater mass flow, by the deriva-
tive element for considering additional heat output of the metal
masses of the evaporator (Kmetal,EVA), by the derivative element
for considering mass storage process of the working fluid in the
economizer (DrWS,ECO), by the degree of sub-cooling at the evapo-
rator inlet (Dsub), by the degree of superheating in case of Benson
mode (Dsup) or the steam quality in case of level mode (Dx) at
the evaporator outlet. Depending on the operation mode (level or
Benson), a further correction is also performed. While in level
mode, the water level within the HP separator should be kept at
a fixed level independent from the HRSG load, the enthalpy at
the outlet of the HP separator in Benson mode should meet the
load dependent enthalpy setpoint.

2.5. Electrical system

PIn addition to process and automation components, a thermal
power plant contains several electrical modules that are vital for the
power plant operation. The consideration of electrical components
in dynamic simulation of thermal power plants is of high relevance
to calculate the electrical power consumption at base loads and
make sure that process and automation components get the needed

nents are used to evaluate the effect of possible failures in the elec-
trical network on automation and process components and to study
the power plant behaviour at severe break down cases such as

all motor driven components trip. The passive system should direct
the power plant to a safe operation point, which can be assessed
using dynamic simulation models.

PThe electrical components required for the dynamic simula-
tion of thermal power plants consist of node, line, switch, load,
generator, transformer, direct current source, battery, inverter,
alternating current/direct current converter and direct current/
direct current converter. The node, switch, line and load compo-
nents can be applied to both alternating current (AC) and direct
current (DC) electrical circuits. The battery and DC/DC converter
are direct current modules, while the inverter and AC/DC con-
verter connect direct current and alternating current circuits.
The generator and transformer can be used only in the alternat-
ing current system. The electrical modules described below are
explained as implemented in the process simulation software
(APROS) [169].

P2.5.1. Basic modules

PIn an electrical system model, the basic electrical components are

node, line, switch and load.

P2.5.1.1. Electrical node.

connect other electrical modules to each other. It can be applied for
both alternating current and direct current electrical circuits (for
example, see Fig. 18).

Pline represented by a resistance (Fig. 18-(a) and (b)) or an AC elec-
trical line with a pi equivalent circuit (Fig. 18-(c)). Each electrical
line has an input and an output connection node, defining the
positive direction of line from the input node to the output node.
The type of the electrical line is automatically defined according
to the type of the connection nodes (both connection nodes must
be either DC or AC nodes). The electrical line has a built-in mea-
surement for current, active power and reactive power. Transmis-
sion electrical
lines become transmission networks, when
interconnected with each other.

PIn direct current electrical circuits, the power is always active
power in steady state. Furthermore, the capacitance or induc-
tance elements are generally not considered. The reactive power
only exists considering transient cases. The impedance of a DC
electrical line contains only an active part, while the reactive
part is zero. The current in a DC electrical line has a homoge-
neous distribution over the cross-section A. Accordingly, the
resistance per length l can be described by the following equa-
tion:

PHere, the character rel is the electrical resistivity that also known
as specific electrical resistance or volume resistivity. The electrical
resistivity is an intrinsic property, describing how strongly the mate-
rial resists the flow of an electric current.

P2.5.1.3. Switch.
PThe switch is located between two electrical nodes
and can be applied to direct or alternating current electrical circuits.
The order of nodes is insignificant, but they have to be same type,
either DC (Fig. 18-(a) and (b)) or AC nodes (Fig. 18-(c)). The switch is
controlled by a logical input. If the input signal is in TRUE state, the
switch is closed. In this case, the switch is a kind of a transparent
module type, i.e. the electrical nodes on both sides of the switch
have the same voltage. If the input signal is in FALSE state, the switch
is open and there is no connection through this module to another
node.

PThe load module models the power consumption in

alternating current or direct current electrical circuits. The
load is connected to one node by either a DC node (Fig. 18-(a)
and (b)) or an AC node (Fig. 18-(c)). The load has a built-in mea-
surement for current, active power and reactive power. The reac-
tive power is zero, if the load is connected to a direct current
node.

P2.5.2. Current sources modules

PThe current sources modules are power generation devices. It can
be distinguished between alternating current generators such as
electrical generator and direct current sources such as battery and
solar photovoltaic.

PThe generator module is applied to model the
P2.5.2.1. Generator.
production of electrical power in alternating current electrical

Pcircuits (see Fig. 19). The generator is connected to one node. The
electrical power produced by the generator is the mechanical power
multiplied by the efficiency. The generator has built-in regulators for
frequency, voltage and power.

P2.5.2.2. Battery.
PA battery is an electric device, converting the
stored chemical energy into electrical energy. The battery mod-
ule can be applied to store the energy of the one-phase direct
current or to supply current to the DC electrical circuits. The bat-
tery is represented as a direct current source, variable initial
resistor and energy charging level counter. The operation modes
the battery include charge, discharge and stand-by. The
of
charge/discharge processes of the battery depend on the voltage
level of the direct current system and the remaining capacity of
the battery.

PThe operating characteristics during the discharge of a battery
depend on discharge capacity and voltage. The discharge capacity
is a function of discharge current (loading), ambient temperature
and long term warehousing, while the voltage is dependent on
discharging current and state of energy storage (loading time).
The discharge capacity Q can be described by Peukert exponen-
tial equation:

Q Ið Þ D CI1¡n

ð2:143Þ
PHere, the symbol I is the discharge current, n denotes the Peukert
exponent with default value of 1.4 and C represents a factor that is
calculated at the nominal point of the battery:

with the formula:

ð2:146Þ
PHere, Unom represents the nominal voltage, the factors K1 and K2
are dependent on discharge current and discharge time. The dis-
charge current is determined by the electricity consumption of the
DC system. The discharge capacity of a battery decreases for reduced
ambient temperature, during long term warehousing or stand-by
without recharging.

PThe charging current can be expressed as a function of capacity:

Q¡0:6Q max

I D Inome
where Qmax is the maximum capacity of battery and Inom represents
the nominal charging current. The internal resistance of the battery
can be changed to control the charging current.

ð2:147Þ

PThe self-discharge process is simulated by decreasing the
capacity of the battery by a small amount during each time step.
The
self-discharge of a battery can be considered in all operation
modes (discharge, charge and stand-by). The self-discharge time
of the battery depends mainly on the ambient temperature. For
example, at 40 °C, the capacity of the battery is assumed to
change from the maximum capacity to zero in 9 months. The
self-discharge time is 21 months at 30 °C, while it is 32 months
at 20 °C.

P2.5.2.3. Solar photovoltaic.
PThe solar photovoltaic system, also
known as solar panel, is a module type for production of DC electri-
cal power (see Fig. 20). The solar panel module is represented as DC
current source with variable internal resistance and is connected to
a weather component. The ideal DC source has constant internal
resistance, while the internal resistance of the solar panel changes
non-linearly with solar radiation. The current and voltage generated

Pby the solar panel module are dependent on the consumption of
electricity in the electrical circuit and the I-V curve of the solar
panel.

P2.5.3. DC and AC modules

PThe DC and AC modules required to simulate the electrical net-
work include DC/AC inverter, AC/DC converter, AC/AC transformer
and DC/DC converter.

P2.5.3.1. DC/AC inverter.
PThe inverter is an electrical device, convert-
ing the voltage from direct current to alternating current. It can be
applied to convert DC electricity from solar panels, batteries or fuel
cells to AC for the electrical grid. The DC/AC inverter is usually not
suitable for inductive AC and sensitive electronic devices that can be
damaged by poor waveforms.

PThe inverter module has two connection nodes and simulates
the transformation of DC electric power into three-phase AC
electric power (see Fig. 18-(c)). The input electrical node is a DC
node, while the output node is an AC type. The DC/AC inverter
module is represented as one electrical line ending in a node
with a high base admittance (nearly zero voltage) to the DC cir-
cuit, in addition to an AC three-phase generator for supplying
power to the AC circuit. The connection between the DC circuit
and AC circuit is arranged in such a way that the AC voltage is
dependent on the DC voltage and the AC apparent power is
equal to the power losses of the DC side resistance. As a result,
the AC load is transferred into the DC supply side.

PThe inverter component can either control the voltage of the AC
circuit or supply the required power. In the power supply mode, the
power of the AC circuit is controlled according to the active power
setpoint. In the voltage control mode, the inverter controls the volt-
age of the second connection node according to the nominal DC volt-
age and voltage. Generally, the single phase DC voltage UDC of the
inverter is higher than the required three-phase (phase to phase)
voltage UAC (approximately UDC D 1.634UAc).

P2.5.3.2. AC/DC converter.
PThe AC/DC converter is an electrical device,
converting the voltage from alternating current to direct current.
This device can be found in several electrical circuits (e.g. charging

Pbatteries), but is characterised by poor current overload capacity and
expensive automatic regulators.

PThe AC/DC converter module models the transformation of three-
phase AC electric power into a DC electric power (see Fig. 18-(b)).
This is represented as one electrical line ending in a node with a high
base admittance (nearly zero voltage) to the AC circuit and a direct
current source, supplying the voltage or power to the DC node. The
connection between AC and DC circuits is arranged to transfer the
DC power loss into the AC supply side. In order to achieve that, the
DC voltage should be a function of the AC voltage and the DC appar-
ent power is equal to the power losses of the AC side resistance.

PSimilar to DC/AC inverter, the AC/DC converter can either control
the voltage of the DC circuit or supply the required power. In voltage
control mode, the conversion is based on a model of ideal diode
bridge under the assumption that the ratio of AC and DC voltages is
constant. The single phase DC voltage of the AC/DC converter is
higher
(approximately
UDC D 1.35UAc). If the AC voltage is lower, then the DC voltage shows
a reduced amplitude.

the

P2.5.3.3. AC/AC transformer.
PThe generated electricity with low
level voltage must be transformed to higher voltage for efficient
electrical power transmission. In this case, the electrical current
decreases, which in turn results in a reduction in the ohmic
losses and a reduction in cross-sectional area of the electrical

Plines. Increasing the voltage by a step-up transformer at the gen-
erating side of the power network decreases the capital cost and
improves the voltage regulation of the system. With the help of
step-down transformer at the receiving end, the high voltage is
reduced to the desired level for distribution to the consumers
(see Fig. 19). The transformer consists basically of two or more
coils that are electrically isolated from each other, but wrapped
together around a closed magnetic iron circuit (core), allowing
the electrical power to be transferred from one coil to other by
induction.

PThe transformer is represented as one electrical line ending in a
node with a high base admittance to the primary circuit and an alter-
nating current generator for supplying the voltage or power to the
secondary circuit (output node). This module has a primary and sec-
ondary connection node. Both connection nodes have to be alternat-
ing current nodes and the order of the nodes is important.

P2.5.3.4. DC/DC converter.
PSimilar to the transformer that transforms
the voltage level between two AC circuits, the DC/DC converter is a
module type for modelling voltage changes in DC electrical circuits
(see Fig. 20). The DC/DC converter can either control the voltage of
the secondary circuit or supply the required power. In the voltage
control mode, the ratio of primary and secondary voltages is
assumed to be constant. The converter is represented as one electri-
cal line ending in a node with a high base admittance to the primary

to the secondary circuit (output node). The connection between the
primary and secondary circuits is arranged in such a way that the
secondary voltage is dependent on the primary voltage and the sec-
ondary apparent power is equal to the power losses of the primary
side resistance. Accordingly, the secondary circuit load is transferred
to the primary circuit supply side.

P2.5.4. Examples

PUsing the described electrical components, the impact of possible
failures in the electrical network on the energy system can be evalu-
ated. Furthermore, the power consumption of process components
can be calculated at steady state and in transient operation cases.
The Figures below show different modelling examples of electrical
networks.

PIn Fig. 18-(a) and (b), the dynamic model of a battery is illustrated
during the charge and discharge processes. In addition to the battery,
various electrical components,
including node, line, AC/DC con-
verter, generator and load are also modelled. In Fig. 18-(c), a DC
source (either a battery or a solar panel) with DC/AC inverter, switch
and AC load is shown.

PThe example of an entire thermal power plant model connected
to the power grid is depicted in Fig. 19. The thermal power plant
generates superheated steam that enters the steam turbine section.
The mechanical power obtained by the steam turbine is transferred
to the generator via a shaft. The electric power produced is fed to the
power grid in addition to other generating units. Part of the electric
power is used to cover the own electricity demand of the power
plant.

PThe dynamic model of a solar panel with battery and load is pre-
sented in Fig. 20. During the day, part of the electricity generated by
the solar panel is consumed by the load and the remaining part is
used to charge the battery (Fig. 20-(a)). In the night, the direct nor-
mal irradiance becomes zero and accordingly the battery starts dis-
charging (Fig. 20-(b)).

3. Combined-cycle power

PGas-fired power generation accounted for 22% total share in 2012
worldwide electricity generation according to IEA [208], dominated
by combined-cycle power plants (CCPP). The modern concept of the
combined-cycle is the result of an evolutionary process in the second
half of last century, mainly driven by increasing performance of the
gas turbine. As early attempts to combine a gas turbine (GT) and a
steam cycle, the GT was installed to enhance the efficiency of exist-
ing large-scale steam power plants by using the hot exhaust gas for
feedwater preheating instead of steam extractions or as a supply of
hot combustion air to the fully-fired steam generator. Korneuburg A
power station, commissioned 1960 in Austria, is considered to be
the first CCPP according to the modern definition of combined-cycle.
The general idea is that the waste heat of a gas turbine is absorbed
by a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) installed downstream in
the flue gas path (see Fig. 21). The generated steam is used in a Ran-
kine bottoming cycle, which generates additional power in the
steam turbine (ST).
Jeffs [209] reports that despite the sound
approach, process efficiency of Korneuburg CCPP did not exceed
32.5%. The GT operating temperatures at the time were as low as
620 °C at the turbine inlet (TIT) and 310 °C at the turbine outlet
(TOT), so that supplementary firing was still required to support the
steam cycle. Major technological developments including high tem-
perature resistant materials and thermal barrier coatings, low-NOx
combustion and innovative cooling methods significantly improved
GT performance since. Whereas early CCPP configurations only used
simple single-pressure HRSGs, additional pressure stages were
introduced over time in order to increase steam parameters and to
reduce the temperature mismatch between flue gas and water/

Psteam side. Today a 1 C 1 arrangement of GT and ST units in combi-
nation with a triple-pressure reheat (3PRH) HRSG is state of the art,
as shown in Fig. 22. Considering TOTs in the order of 600 °C, supple-
mentary firing is widely omitted and nominal efficiency of the pro-
cess can reach up to 60%. Also, combined-cycle power plants with
efficiency levels greater than 60% are now running, for example
Irsching 4 plant that is located in Irsching, Germany. A more detailed
introduction to the technical characteristics of the combined-cycle
process is offered in Kehlhofer et al. [210]. Combined-cycle power
plants can also supply useful thermal energy for district heating,
decreasing the total fuel consumption and reaching high efficiencies
[211].

PIn contrast to other thermal power plants, beside higher effi-
ciency combined-cycle power plants are also characterized by flexi-
ble unit dispatch, see Lu and Shahidehpour [212]. Fast response
capability is a prerequisite for increasing shares of renewable feed-
in and thus represents a competitive advantage for the operator in a
changing market environment. Three criteria are typically consid-
ered to assess the practical flexibility of a power plant: start-up
time, maximum load gradient (positive and negative) and minimum
load. Only 10 min are required for starting a simple-cycle gas tur-
bine, irrespective of its initial temperature. CCPP load transients are,
however, limited by thermal stresses in the thick-walled compo-
nents of the bottoming steam cycle, namely ST rotor, ST casing, high
pressure (HP) drum and outlet manifolds of HP superheater and final
reheater. A modern CCPP can complete the start-up procedure in less
than 30 min after an overnight shutdown and sustain challenging
load gradients up to § 60%/min, as e.g. stipulated by the Great Brit-
ain Grid Code for primary frequency response. The minimum load of
a combined-cycle is mainly determined by the gas turbine, where
stable combustion as well as CO and NOx levels in compliance with
emission regulations must be preserved. Consequently, the corre-
sponding operating point is dependent on the specific type of gas
turbine and possibly country-specific regulation. The operating load
can be decreased to 40(cid:1)50% of nominal load for typical gas turbines.
This level may be further reduced to 20% if a sequential-combustion
design is used, so that one GT combustor can be shut down entirely.
Minimum load is relevant to flexible operation since it defines the
lower boundary for negative load changes. If frequent cycling is
anticipated, a CCPP capable of operation at low minimum load may
also be an economically viable option to reduce the number of start-
ups and shutdowns.

PCalculation and optimisation of the transient system behaviour
are an integral part of the CCPP design process with particular
regard to control design. This ensures that the actual power plant
meets the contractual guarantees and regulatory requirements in
all states of operation. According to Radin et al. [213], dynamic

Psimulation is also a cost-efficient tool to support unit commis-
sioning and regular operation by estimating component lifetime
and directing maintenance. For verification of the overall plant
design and control concept, a sophisticated simulation model is
required that can be considered a virtual representation of all the
essential systems for plant dynamics. The complexity of these
simulation models, based on differential equation systems and
numerical solution procedures, entails a computational effort that
is unsuitable for optimisation purposes. Therefore, a reduced sys-
tem model must be developed, which captures the dynamic
behaviour and makes the problem accessible to mathematical
techniques such as optimal control. The results are then verified
by applying the optimised solution to the original simulation
model and e.g. checking if boundary conditions are violated.

PThis chapter gives an overview of the published studies on
dynamic simulation applied to gas-turbine based power plants,
focusing on combined-cycles. Due to its considerable inertia and
delayed system response, the bulk of the studies are dedicated to
HRSG modelling and simulation. Section 3.1 introduces the reader to
the dynamic behaviour of the CCPP by considering basic parameter
variations and load changes. In Section 3.2, the simulation of start-
up procedures and the numerous investigations dedicated to start-
up optimisation are covered. Section 3.3 is a brief overview of com-
plementary works on dynamic simulation in the broader context of
gas-turbine based power plants, including numerical studies of com-
pressed-air energy storage and integrated gasification combined-
cycle.

3.1. Load change

POne of the basic tasks for dynamic simulation in the field of ther-
mal power plants is to calculate the response of the physical system
and the control circuits to a change in load demand. While load
changes are rather simple procedures both in terms of practical exe-
cution and numerical study, they are still useful to gain insight into
the transient system behaviour of a combined-cycle power plant.

PFor the purpose of describing CCPP dynamics, the gas turbine can
typically be treated as quasi-static component since the GT system
inertia and characteristic time scale of GT response are negligibly
small in comparison to the bottoming cycle. This statement does not
hold if there is integration of gas turbine and bottoming cycle that
prevents a separate analysis of the two, such as GT steam cooling.
Detailed gas turbine modelling is not covered in this chapter: For
system-level considerations, describing GT exhaust mass flow
(including flue gas composition) and exhaust temperature as simple
functions of load is often sufficient. Constant GT exhaust tempera-
ture is typically maintained in the range between full load and
approximately 50% load whereas the GT exhaust mass flow shows a
linear variation due to the changing position of the inlet guide vanes
(IGV). Below this load range, the IGV remain at closed position and
flue gas temperature is proportional to GT load. Thus a load change
directly translates to a corresponding change of GT exhaust mass
flow and/or flue gas temperature.

PFrom a mathematical point of view, this is a perturbation of the
initial system in steady state to which the bottoming cycle responds

Pdynamically. Dechamps [214] suggested four time constants of a sin-
gle HRSG heat exchanger as measure of the time to reach equilib-
rium in response to a perturbation:

P t1 - governing the enthalpy exchange for the flue gas,
P t2 - governing the external heat transfer of the tube wall,
P t3 - governing the internal heat transfer of the tube wall,
P t4 - governing the enthalpy exchange for water/steam.

PPractical calculations show that the time constants for enthalpy
exchange processes are comparatively small (t1 » 0.1 s and t4 » 1 s)
and that the overall time constant of the single heat exchanger is
typically controlled by external gas-side heat transfer (t2 » 100 s):
t2 D mc
a0A0
PThe time constant is therefore defined as the thermal capacitance
of the heat exchanger mc divided by the rate of convective heat
transfer a0A0.

ð3:1Þ

PHowever, the HRSG is a complex arrangement of several heat
exchangers positioned in the flue gas channel according to the tem-
perature profile. In order to take into account the thermal capaci-
tance of the components (j D 1. . .i ¡ 1) between the given component
and the perturbation, G€ulen and Kim [215] state that the time con-
stant of a component ti can be approximated with sufficient accuracy
by a simple summation of all single time constants:

PThe heat exchanger closest to GT exhaust, typically the final HP
superheater, directly faces the perturbation in gas enthalpy. It is con-
sequently the first to respond and eventually reach steady state. In
contrast, the response of the next heat exchanger is delayed since
part of the perturbation is absorbed upstream. The time constant of
the individual heat exchanger in the HRSG thus increases in propor-
tion to its distance from the source of the perturbation whereas the
fraction of the heat input available to the heat exchanger decreases
(see Fig. 23).

PShin et al. [216] studied the system response of a simple 2P HRSG
to rapid changes and sinusoidal variations of GT load. The HRSG was
modelled forming unsteady conservation equations of mass and
energy for bulk heat exchangers. Fig. 24 illustrates the characteristic
time scales of the gas turbine, high pressure (HP) and low pressure
(LP) circuits using 10% load increase as example. The authors assume
that GT load is controlled by the fuel mass flow in order to yield a
step-like temperature increase, which explains the constant exhaust
mass flow. From top to bottom, the figures show the responses of
the GT system, HP and LP drum pressures as well as HP steam tem-
perature and flue gas outlet temperature (the latter is closely linked
to the temperature variation of the LP economiser).
It can be
observed that the gas turbine reaches stable operation after (tGT D 4
s), which is negligible in relation to the time constants of the HP and
LP circuits (tHP D 200 s and tLP D 2000 s) and confirms that the quasi-
static assumption is justified. The delayed response of the LP circuit
in comparison to the HP circuit due to the accumulated thermal
capacitance of the upstream heat exchangers is also reflected.

PPletl

[87] conducted transient experiments supported by
numerical simulation for a single-pressure once-through HRSG at
the combined heat and power plants of TU Munich, where the gas
turbine was simulated by a duct burner. Fig. 25 shows the mea-
sured and calculated flue gas temperatures as function of time for
different tube layers between flue gas inlet and the stack in a
rewetting experiment. The system is initially characterised by a
deliberate lack of feedwater supply for the given, constant heat
input. The steam is completely superheated already when enter-
ing the heat exchangers and no additional heat from the flue gas

Pis absorbed. Therefore, the flue gas temperatures for tube layers
36 and 40 are equal at t D 0. For 0 (cid:3) t (cid:3) 70, a linear increase of the
feedwater mass flow to the nominal value is conducted. Since the
function of heat exchangers in a once-through steam generator is
variable, the zone of evaporation is shifted downstream and addi-
tional mass is injected in the HRSG. This entails a reduction of the
water/steam temperature to saturation temperature for some
tube layers that initially contained superheated steam, so that all
heat exchangers contribute to heat transfer in steady state. The
transient between the two operating points is governed by heat
discharge of tube walls and structural material. The simulation
results presented in the figure clearly show that neglecting ther-
mal inertia in the HRSG model results in a significant underesti-
mation of time constants and an inaccurate prediction of system
response. The author also reports that compared to the consider-
ation of thermal storage masses, replacing the standard homoge-
neous model with the more sophisticated slip flow model yields
only a minor improvement of simulation results. A plausible
explanation is that the 180 ° tube baffles between the tube layers
allow for momentum exchange between water and steam phase
[87]. It should finally be noted that the effect of thermal inertia is
more pronounced in this example vis-(cid:2)a-vis a commercial plant
due to the relatively large amount of liner and structural material
in the scaled down HRSG system.

PKim and Edgar [217,218] developed a mixed-integer nonlinear
programming approach and applied it to a combined heat and power
plant. The power plant completely covers the utility's changing
demands of power, heat and cooling throughout the year. The devel-
oped model aims to maximise the net income of the power plant by
selling surplus power to the grid. The results show that the devel-
oped algorithm is an effective methodology with reasonable compu-
tation time of few hours to determine the optimal operation in 24 h
ahead.

PThe dynamic behaviour of uncontrolled HRSG is usually not
encountered in practical applications. Commercial CCPP use hierarchi-
cal plant control that is structured according to high-level unit control,
system control and component control. As the basic control circuit of a
transient HRSG model, feedwater control is addressed in the follow-
ing. However, it must be complemented by several additional control
circuits e.g. for live steam attemperation and ST bypass stations in
order to describe the transient behaviour of the overall CCPP system.

PWeiß [219] and Rieger [19] investigated HRSG test configurations
at the same plant in order to improve the performance of once-
through feedwater mass flow control
in response to rapid load
changes. Weiß distinguishes between load changes with variation of
the flue gas mass flow (upper load range) and load changes with vari-
ation of the flue gas temperature (lower load range). The former type
is controlled with relative ease since all HRSG components are influ-
enced at the same time and the temperature profile along the flue
gas path remains largely unchanged. In contrast, for the latter type
strong thermal charging and discharging processes of the storage
masses are present that dampen load following behaviour of the bot-
toming cycle. The author therefore suggests a modification of the
mass flow controller that introduces a source term for heat storage in
the calculation of the mass flow setpoint. Based on measurement
data, the current energy content of steel and water/steam inventory
is estimated and compared with the fictional energy content in steady
state for the current boundary conditions. The difference is used for
adjustment of the feedwater mass flow, considering a desired transi-
tion time [219]. Rieger studied the capability of different control con-
cepts for once-through HRSG to handle rapid load changes from full
load to 38% and vice versa. In level control mode, the separator level
is the controlled variable while steam enthalpy at the evaporator out-
let is used for once-through control mode. Due to the long distance
between control valve and measuring point, both control concepts
are initially characterised by a slow response that allows controlling a
maximum load gradient of § 7%/min. In an approach similar to Weiß,
by considering thermal storage in the HRSG material the permitted
load gradients in the test plant could be increased to 30%/min for
level mode and 14%/min for once-through mode [19].

PWhile level-based control is typical for drum-type evaporators,
this concept is not applicable for once-through evaporators after the
initial start-up phase since the separator is run dry. Alobaid et al.
[14] developed a sophisticated mass flow controller for once-
through HRSGs that covers all states of CCPP operation (see Fig. 17).
The controller switches from level control mode to once-through
control mode when a sufficient degree of steam superheating is
reached at the evaporator outlet. The control principle is derived
from the available heat input absorbed from the flue gas, which is
corrected by thermal energy storage of the evaporator mass and
divided by the desired enthalpy increase in the evaporator. Further
corrections account for fluid-side mass storage in the evaporator,

at the outlet to calculate the current mass flow setpoint [14].

3.2. Start-up procedure

PFast start-up capability is the key benchmark for flexibility of a
power generation unit and distinguishes CCPP from other conven-
tional power plant technologies. The accurate calculation of com-
bined-cycle start-up procedures and the reduction of start-up time
with various optimisation methods therefore receive considerable
attention in the literature. Start-up procedures are classified as hot
starts after overnight shutdown, warm starts after weekend shut-
down and cold starts after a shutdown of several days. However,
these categories are too broad for practical purposes. Operating tran-
sients are in fact determined as function of initial “cold” metal tem-
peratures of the thick-walled components, in particular ST rotor, ST
casing and HP drum. A conventional CCPP start-up sequence, as
shown in Fig. 26, is conducted as follows:

P(cid:3) Purging: The GT is accelerated to approximately 25% of nominal
speed using the generator as motor or with an auxiliary starter.
This speed is maintained for some minutes until the gas duct vol-
ume has been exchanged with air several times to remove any
residual hydrocarbons. Condenser vacuum is established by a
vacuum pump or ejector.

P(cid:3) Ignition and synchronisation: The burners are ignited, which
marks the actual beginning of the start-up (t D 0). The GT quickly
accelerates to nominal speed corresponding to the grid frequency,
after which it is automatically synchronised. Up to this point, the
sequence is independent of the initial metal temperatures.

P(cid:3) Steam temperature matching: The GT is loaded to minimum load
(IGV in closed position) and held until the required parameters
for steam admission to the ST (approximately 50% of nominal
pressure and a sufficient degree of superheating) are met. Mean-
while initial steam generation is accommodated by the ST bypass
system so that HP pressure is increased in a controlled manner.
The hold time increases with the duration of the preceding shut-
down. Once steam quality is confirmed, the ST control valve is
opened and first steam is admitted to the ST.

P(cid:3) Loading: The GT is loaded to the given load setpoint by gradually
shifting the IGV to open position; the permitted load gradient is a
function of the selected start-up mode. The switchover of steam

duced from reference [210]).

Padmission from ST bypass valves to the ST control valve is con-
ducted in parallel. According to the common OEM definition, the
start-up sequence is completed when all bypass valves are fully
closed and the total steam generation is admitted to the ST. This
point corresponds to approximately 90% of nominal load for a
start-up to full load, so that the load may still increase after start-
up completion.

PThis step-by-step start-up sequence is conservative in the sense
that the procedure limits thermal stresses due to a gradual increase
of metal temperatures in thick-walled components. Kehlhofer et al.
[210] specify conventional start-up times in case of a 400 MW sin-
gle-shaft CCPP as 155 min for cold start, 105 min for warm start and
47 min for hot start. Recently, dynamic simulation was used to
design fast start-up schemes for warm and hot start-ups that shorten
or omit steam temperature matching by applying measures such as
sophisticated stress control, flexible header design and cascaded HP
steam bypass. The start-up time for hot starts can thus be reduced to
less than 30 min, see Ruchti et al. [220]. The following section is ded-
icated to publications on start-up simulation and the comparison of
simulation results with measurement data. The balance between
combined-cycle start-up time and lifetime consumption of the criti-
cally stressed components is the determining factor for start-up
optimisation, as described in Section 3.2.2.

P3.2.1. Simulation

PInterest in CCPP dynamic simulation sparked in the early 1990s
primarily in Europe and Asian-Pacific countries, owing to the success
of combined-cycle in the recently liberalised electricity markets and
the rapid progress in digital computing.

PIn an early study, Dechamps [214] described an approach to
model the complex geometry of HRSG finned-tube bundles with an
equivalent one-dimensional heat exchanger. The unsteady energy
conservation equations for flue gas, metal and working fluid are dis-
cretised by finite-volume method and solved with an explicit inte-
gration scheme. The latter uses a constant time step and a density
correction for numerical stability and reduced computational effort.
Complemented by PID drum level controllers, the method is applied
to reproduce the cold start of a 2P HRSG. The comparison with mea-
surement, in particular the timing of first steam generation and the
accurate jump of drum level, suggests that the system inertia and
swelling effect are well described. Temperature results are not pre-
sented in the work, however.

PKim et al. [221] investigated the effect of CCPP cold start-up with
a flue gas bypass on thermal stress in the drum of a 1P HRSG. Using
the lumped capacitance method, heat exchangers are modeled as
bulk heat exchangers and not discretised in space. The drum is
assumed to reach thermal equilibrium after each time step, yielding
a quasi-static problem formulation. The authors show that operation
of the flue gas bypass can be scheduled to mitigate thermal stress
peaks at the inner drum surface. Despite the simplifications and
although the use of such bypass stacks has been widely omitted
since, the study is one of the first to consider thermal stress in com-
bined-cycle operation.

PAlobaid et al. [12] presented the model of a commercial-scale
3PRH HRSG, based on the six-equation flow model of the thermal
hydraulic process simulator Apros as well as detailed geometry and
heat balance data. The gas turbine is simplified as time-dependent
boundary condition of exhaust gas mass flow and temperature. Fig.
27 shows part of the presented results for a warm start-up sequence,
which are in close agreement with measurement data. The devia-
tions of initial pressure level as well as steam flow during the
switchover from ST bypass valve to ST control valve reflect unavail-
able information with regard to valve characteristics.

PMeinke [65] developed the process model of a 3PRH CCPP
with a homogeneous flow model, using DYMOLA/MODELICA. In

Pcontrast to the previously described studies, the model also
includes the GT system and the associated control circuits such
as exhaust temperature control by IGV and GT power control.
This requires proprietary information such as the detailed char-
acteristics of GT compressor mass flow as function of pressure
ratio and IGV position. The model is validated with measurement
data of a hot start to 54% load and results show generally good
agreement, part of which are depicted in Fig. 28. A typical prob-
lem is the determination of the exhaust mass flow, which is not
measured in the real plant but calculated indirectly via the resid-
ual oxygen content. This entails significant uncertainty particu-
larly at

consumption of thick-walled components in the natural-circula-
tion HRSG under a future scenario is estimated. This scenario
attempts to reflect the German electricity market in 2023, which
is characterised by the complete abandonment of nuclear power
and a high share of renewable feed-in. Flexibility improvements

Pof the current CCPP that translate into a minimum load of 40%
and a permissible load gradient of 4.8%/min are also considered.
lifetime consumption
The study concludes that the share of
attributed to warm and hot starts of the plant is predominant
and that the rate of lifetime consumption is nearly doubled in
the future due to the higher frequency of warm starts [65].

PWhile researchers usually close the differential equation system
with empirical correlations, Sindareh-Esfahani et al. [113] used a
Genetic Algorithm function of MATLAB/SIMULINK to identify
unknown parameters for heat transfer. Two separate sets of experi-
mental data gathered during HRSG cold start-up were required, one
for training and one for model validation.

PHack et al. [131] presented a methodology for adaptation of
HRSG design to cycling operation. Dynamic simulation of the
CCPP system for cold and warm start-up is conducted in a first
step, where the natural-circulation HP evaporator loop is consid-
the calculated steam

Ptemperature and pressure transients as well as the heat transfer
coefficients are applied as boundary conditions for detailed
finite-element analysis of the drum-riser connection (see Fig.
29). The obtained thermal stresses combined with pressure
stresses are used to analyse the material fatigue caused by start-
up and shutdown cycles. Discontinuities such as weld connec-
tions and surface irregularities are accounted for by a conserva-
tive reduction factor for fatigue strength. The authors summarize
that there is significant potential
for start-up time reduction
while maintaining acceptable component life.

PMertens et al. [16] compared the dynamic behaviour of two 3PRH
HRSG models - drum-type and once-through (cid:1) with equal steady
state output for cold, warm and hot start-up procedures using Apros.
Thermal stress sth is generally proportional the difference between
average wall temperature Tave and inner wall temperature Tin, which
is negative for start-up processes:

Punderestimated in the model. The sudden pressure drop after shut-
down, which is not explained by the simulation, is attributed to
manual venting of the superheater in order to prevent condensation
during extended standstill.

PG€ulen and Kim [215] developed an independent concept,
using the time constant of individual heat exchangers to model
transient processes with simplified arithmetic equations rather
than differential equations. Experience-based steam admission
logic and practical assumptions are presented to complement
the approach. For 3PRH HRSGs in combination with F-Class GT,
the proposed method is shown to reproduce the published
results of sophisticated codes with good qualitative agreement.
As most researchers use complex simulation codes, which inher-
ently impairs full transparency of the underlying methods and
the possibility of reproducing results, their approach is a notable
exception among the cited studies.

P3.2.2. Optimisation

PFig. 30 shows the temperature responses in the wall of the HP
drum vis-(cid:2)a-vis the wall of the once-through separator bottle, indi-
cating smaller temperature peaks and comparatively fast tempera-
ture adjustment for the separator. The study concludes that the
once-through HRSG is favourable for combined-cycle plants with
enhanced flexibility requirements, at the cost of slightly increased
heat exchanger surface of the HP circuit (approximately 9% in the
given case).

PRecently, Mertens et al. [18] studied the dynamic behaviour of a
commercial 3PRH CCPP for a start-up and shutdown operating cycle
with Apros. The measured and calculated responses for the HP cir-
cuit of the bottoming cycle are compared in Fig. 31, showing gener-
ally good agreement. However, the premature occurrences of the
initial temperature ramp in the HP superheater and of first steam
generation indicate that the thermal inertia of the real plant is

PConsidering a given simulation model that can successfully
reproduce the transient behaviour of the real power plant, it is
straightforward to take one further step and investigate the poten-
tial for optimisation. For instance, existing CCPPs can generate addi-
tional revenue by faster start-up procedures if the additional costs
for maintenance and replacement are appropriately taken into
account [222]. This increase of lifetime consumption can be miti-
gated by incorporating rigorous start-up optimisation in the design
of the CCPP, more precisely the minimisation of start-up time sub-
ject to operating restrictions such as thermal stress. Some recent
efforts are dedicated to introducing Model-Predictive Control (MPC)
in power plant systems, which offers performance advantages com-
pared to conventional PID control, in particular for highly dynamic
systems and systems with delayed response. In MPC the control
input is computed by solving an optimisation problem for the

PBausa and Tsatsaronis [223] found that numerical solution meth-
ods for large-scale dynamic optimisation problems, which assume
the general form of differential-algebraic equation systems (DAEs),
are available from optimal control problems in chemical engineer-
ing. The standard form of an optimal control problem is to minimise
the cost functional J subject to the state equation a, algebraic con-

PIn this notation x is the state vector, u is the control vector and t is

discussion on the necessary conditions for optimality. For the pur-
pose of this chapter and the specific application to CCPP start-up, it
is sufficient to state that numerical methods are required to solve
nonlinear optimal control problems and that direct collocation
methods have shown to be an efficient approach for large-size opti-
misation. The general idea of collocation is to discretise the state and
control variables over time and to substitute these variables as well
as the cost function with polynomial approximations (see Fig.
32). Polynomial coefficients are treated as variables of the opti-
misation process that need to satisfy the system equations at
discrete points in the time domain, also known as collocation
points. The discretised parameter optimisation problem can e.g.
be solved by sequential-quadratic programming algorithms. In

PThe neural network is trained in parallel, using start-up schedules
and operating parameters as inputs and schedule modification rates
obtained by fuzzy logic as outputs. During the optimisation, the
actual schedule modification is gradually shifted from fuzzy logic to
the neural network for fine adaptation e.g. to ambient temperature
and humidity. Constraints such as thermal stress in the ST rotor,
temperature gradient in the HP drum and NOx emissions were
imposed. The authors report a reduction in start-up time and fuel
consumption by 35.6% and 26.3%, respectively.

PShirakawa et al. [227] conducted start-up optimisation of a vali-
dated 3PRH HRSG model by sequential quadratic programming. The
nonlinear optimisation problem is formulated to reduce start-up
time, using control inputs bound by upper and lower boundaries
and operational constraints such as ST rotor stress, temperature gra-
dient in the HP drum and NOx emissions. Compared to conventional
optimisation based on the practitioner's experience, start-up time is
reduced by another 22% while satisfying the specified constraints.

PCasella and Pretolani [66] presented the simplified model of a
3PRH CCPP in DYMOLA/MODELICA for optimisation purposes, in
which the LP system is largely neglected. The radial temperature dis-
tribution in the ST rotor is calculated by Fourier's equation, discre-
tised with finite differences. Results show that the thermal stress

Ppeak is located at the beginning of ST loading phase and that both
peak stress and start-up time can be significantly reduced with
regard to the reference procedure, despite the fact that the optimisa-
tion process is described as “trial-and-error” rather than an optimal-
ity-based method.

PAlbanesi et al. [228] optimised the cold start-up procedure for
different stress constraints of the ST rotor, using the variations of GT
load and of valve position for ST admission as control variables. The
result shows that the required start-up time is reduced by 20% for a
conservative stress constraint and 48% for a standard stress con-
straint; however, the presented reference procedure is rather
lengthy (340 min).

PFaille and Davelaar [112] decomposed the start-up transient in
four phases and optimised steam temperature matching phase and
GT loading phase with MATLAB/SIMULINK. As the resulting start-up
sequence satisfies all operating constraints for the reduced model
but exceeds one constraint for the detailed simulation model, their
study demonstrates that the model to be optimised must accurately
capture the original system dynamics despite the reduction in com-
plexity.

PTica et al. [69] derived a reduced model from the simulation
model by Casella and Pretolani [66] in DYMOLA/MODELICA in order

3.3. Additional studies

PIn the following a brief overview of complementary works on
dynamic simulation in the broader context of combined-cycle power
plants is offered, including alternative concepts for GT-based power
plants.

P3.3.1. Island operation

PA case that rarely occurs in practice is the so-called island opera-
tion, i.e. power plant operation disconnected from the grid. Both
Ahluwalia and Domenichini [229] and Maderni et al. [230] studied
the transient behaviour of a 60 MW CCPP at Mirafiori,
Italy,
including the switchover from regular grid operation to island
operation. Fig. 33 shows the simulation results for opening of
the circuit breaker, yielding a rapid drop from full load to the
load level currently demanded by the local manufacturing plant.
The authors also report an effort to control high-frequency and
high-amplitude load disturbances in island mode, related to
welding stations.

P3.3.2. Compressed-air energy storage

PThe basic idea of compressed-air energy storage (CAES) is to com-
bine a simple-cycle gas turbine process with storage for pressurised
air (see Fig. 34). Operation of the plant is therefore inherently
dynamic: In storage mode, the storage cavern is loaded with pres-
surised air when excess electrical energy is available. In generation
mode, the air is used for combustion of natural gas in the GT during
peak electricity demand. The gas turbine with compressed air energy
storage can be started without additional energy from the power
grid and reaches 100% of its nominal load in approximately 6 min.
For the purpose of comparison, new gas turbines (without com-
pressed air energy storage) can be run up to full load within 20 min,
while the half of the generated power is used to drive the compres-
sor. The fast start-up of CAES power plants is of high relevance as a
standby power plant for case of electrical network failure and even
to stabilize variances of fluctuating energy sources such as wind
energy etc. For CAES a large, well-explored and pressure-tight stor-
age cavern is required, resulting in a limited number of suitable sites.
Two plants currently exist in the world: Huntorf in Germany
(290 MW, h D 42%) and McIntosh in the USA (110 MW, h D 54%). The
latter is more efficient since exhaust heat is recovered for preheating

Pto make it accessible to gradient-based optimisation methods. These
methods require continuously differentiable equations so that possi-
ble sources of discontinuity in the reference model, such as condi-
tional
functions, case distinctions and lookup tables, must be
replaced with smooth approximations. Small deviation from the
reduced model is reported when the computed solution of the mini-
mum-time optimal control problem is re-applied to the reference
model. In conclusion, the authors state that the proposed method is
able to convert nonlinear simulation models based on MODELICA
into reduced optimisation models suitable for MPC.

PIn an effort to close the gap between physical modelling on the
one hand and optimisation on the other hand, Larsson et al. [102]
extended the open-source platform JModelica.org as interface to
numerical optimisation algorithms. The nonlinear MPC optimisation
problem is formulated with the Optimica extension of MODELICA
and solved by direct collocation methods and automatic differentia-
tion. A case study of a warm combined-cycle start-up with MPC is
presented using the same reference model [66] as Tica et al. It is con-
cluded that the proposed framework can be successfully applied to
nonlinear MPC in the field of power generation, and that further

Pof the combustion air. Based on dynamic simulation of the cyclic
operation, Yoshimoto and Nanahara [231] combined CAES with a
water/steam bottoming cycle for increased efficiency. Nielsen and
Leithner [88] further improved the concept by means of a thermal
storage that absorbs heat from the hot compressed air in storage
mode for combustion air preheating in generation mode. In addition
the study proposes the use of a brine shuttle pond at the surface con-
nected to the cavern, which in contrast to conventional CAES allows
almost isobaric discharging by varying the storage volume (for
details, see Nielsen [89]).

P3.3.3. Integrated gasification combined-cycle

PThe integrated gasification combined-cycle (IGCC) is a promis-
ing concept to make the high-efficiency combined-cycle process
available to solid fuels such as coal by means of a chemical gasi-
fication and syngas treatment plant installed upstream (see Fig.
35). The distinct advantage of IGCC is the possibility to efficiently
integrate pre-combustion capture of carbon dioxide. Only a small
number of IGCC plants without carbon capture were commis-
sioned hitherto due to the substantial complexity of the process,
which drives investment costs and heavily affects practical avail-
ability. Operating experience of these plants also shows that
dynamic operation is a challenge, motivating several recent pub-
lications on the subject.

PSeparate component models and their control circuits were pre-
sented by Seliger et al. [111] for the cryogenic air separation unit in
MATLAB/SIMULINK and by Robinson and Luyben [39] for H2S
absorber unit, water-gas shift reactors and CO2 stripping unit in
Aspen Dynamics. Casella and Colonna [67] coupled the MODELICA

Pmodel of an entrained-flow gasifier to an existing CCPP model for
system-level control studies. Limited validation of the gasifier model
is conducted with steady state reference data of an operating IGCC.
Bauersfeld [68] developed a modular MODELICA library of IGCC
components, focusing on the chemical systems for syngas treatment.
Lee et al. [232] conducted dynamic simulations with the detailed
model of a Shell entrained flow gasifier, partially validated by steady
state data. Najmi et al. [95] investigated different control strategies
for IGCC load change in gPROMS. A buffer tank between sorption-
enhanced water gas shift and GT is used in order to reduce the fluc-
tuations in mass flow and composition of fuel gas. The authors state
that smooth operation during load changes can be maintained if the
load ramp of the gasifier is initiated ahead of the GT, which follows a
sequence of multiple small load changes and intermediate waiting
times.

4. Coal-fired power

PCoal-fired power plant plays a major role for the global electricity
supply at present and in the foreseeable future. The specific contri-
bution varies from country to country and depends on several
impact factors such as coal and gas prices, political framework, local
resources and access to the world market. In Fig. 36, the flow sche-
matic of a modern hard-coal fired power plant is presented. The
main component is the steam generator, where pulverised coal
entrained with the primary air flow is burned, releasing the thermal
energy stored in chemical bounds. The obtained heat is transferred
to the working fluid in economiser, evaporator and superheater in
order to generate steam for the Rankine cycle. Modern coal-fired

Ppower plants use single reheat and several low pressure and high
pressure feedwater preheaters, resulting in an increase of the ther-
mal process efficiency. The flue gas leaves the steam generator and
the remaining heat is applied to preheat the combustion air using an
air preheater. The flue gas may pass different cleaning devices like
selective catalytic reduction system, a particulate collector and a
desulphurisation unit. The size of a coal-fired power plant has a
range from small industrial units to large utility power plants with
up to 1300 MW per unit [233].

PEven though all coal-fired power plants are working on the same
principle, every power plant is individually engineered, which
leads to different operation modes and different dynamic behaviour.
Criteria that define the specific design are listed in the following
points:

P(cid:3) Coal composition: The coal composition has the most important
influence on pulverisers, burners, furnace, heat exchangers, foul-
ing and size of flue gas cleaning devices. Here, the content ash,
sulphur, volatiles, water and fixed carbon lead to specific require-
ments for each component. The list of fuel categories is long and
varies from country to country and reaches from (meta-) anthra-
cite over bituminous and subbituminous coal to lignite [234].
P(cid:3) Fuel handling and firing concepts: Normally, pulverised coal-
fired plants are equipped with a direct firing system. Here, the
raw coal is pulverised in the mill and transported by primary air
directly to the burners. Depending on coal composition, different
mills like ball tube, ball, roller, beater mills can be used. The
respond of the pulverised coal flow to a change of the raw coal
feed or the primary air has a significant impact on the dynamic
and transient behaviour. In power plants with circulating fluid-
ized bed (CFB) combustion, different dynamic responses are
occurring.

P(cid:3) Emissions limits: The local emission regulation limits define how
large the flue gas cleaning devices have to be designed and
weather to be applied at all.

P(cid:3) Water/steam cycle: While power plants with supercritical steam
parameters are always designed for once-through operation,
plants with sub-critical steam parameters may also be equipped
with a natural or a forced circulation. Even though one reheater
stage is state of the art, some plants are equipped with a second
reheater stage.

P(cid:3) Reheater temperature control: The usage of water extracted from
the feedwater pump in attemperators is the most common way
for temperature control of coal-fired power plants.
If other
reheater control concepts like flue gas recirculation, tilting burn-
ers, flue gas dampers or internal heat exchangers in the water/
steam cycle are applied, other controls are necessary and the
dynamic behaviour may differ.

PDynamic models of coal-fired power plants are developed for dif-
ferent reasons. At early stages, the models were often restricted by
the computational time and therefore limited to smaller subsections
of the power plant. Here, the models were generally divided into
small subsystems like turbine or boiler systems. One of the most
detailed model of a fossil-fired plant of the first two decades of
dynamic plant simulation was published by Armor et al. [235] in
1982. The authors used the tool, so-called modular modelling system
in order to create a model of the Mystic Unit 7 power plant
(550 MW). Although the developed model was very complex, but
the used fuel in the steam generator is oil. Apart from the missing
pulverisers and the additional flue gas recirculation, the power plant
is similar to other coal-fired power plants of the time. The authors
described the modelling process and gave an interesting overview of
the occurring problems. For a quality check of the power plant
model, several simulation tests have been performed, showing a
promising match between the measured data and the predicted

Psimulations. The general approach of the model was unconventional
for time and gave an idea for whole scope of dynamic power plant
simulation. Today, the computational resources are sufficient and
the numerical models of coal-fired power plants are becoming more
detailed, driven by increasing market pressure for high efficiency,
operating flexibility and emissions compliance. Since the response
of pulverised coal flow to a change of the raw fuel feed is of great
importance for the dynamic behaviour of a coal-fired plant, different
mathematical models were developed. For the description of ver-
tical pulveriser, several models are proposed over the last deca-
des (among others: Lee [236], Fan [237], Zhou et al. [193] or
Niemczyk et al. [238]). Others models developed for tube-balls
(Wei et al. [239]) or for beater mills used in lignite coal-fired
power plant like the model of Debelikovic et al. presented in
their work [240]. In general, the pulveriser models have different
parameters that must be adjusted to the specific type of pulver-
iser, since factors like size or geometry have an influence on the
dynamics of the power plant. The pulveriser model of Fan [237]
has been validated with operational data of a vertical spindle
mill in Australia, but for other pulveriser types the available data
is limited.

PIn this section, the dynamic models of coal-fired power plants
from the literature are categorised in different sections correspond-
ing to the published simulation results.

4.1. Response to disturbances

PAt

the beginning,

resources and powerful

researches and engineers

tried using
dynamic simulation models to understand the response of the
coal-fired power plant during a disturbance [241]. The mathe-
matical model of a 200 MW drum-type steam generator was one
of the first detailed models published by Kwan and Anderson in
1970 [242]. In order to describe the system, 109 equations have
been developed and linearized. In the 1970s, the dynamic pro-
cess simulation was at the beginning of its development and lim-
ited by the computational
tools.
Nevertheless, the illustrated results show the impact of a step
change of the governor valve, fuel, air flow or feedwater supply
to the rest of the power plant. With the aid of the dynamic sim-
ulation tools, the qualitative and quantitative behaviours after a
step disturbance became a well-known scenario. Therefore, the
simulation of a step disturbance is often used as an indicator for
the model quality of large and complex models when operational
data is missing. Lu [117] introduced a model of 677 MW unit
located at Castle Peak B power plant in Hong Kong, China using
itself has a general purpose
MATLAB/SIMULINK. The model
reaching from optimisation to personal training. The used equa-
tions are described and offer the reader a very good overview of
the mathematical structure. However,
the numerical results
obtained from dynamic simulations lack validation towards
experimental data. The model quality is checked via the response
to step changes, namely a change in the main pressure step
change and a sudden position change of the main steam valve.
The given results indicate a reasonable response of modelled
physics and control systems. Recently, an entire coal-fired power
plant model of one 500 MW unit at the Didcot power station
was presented by Oko and Wang [243]. The developed model
describes the steam generator and the complete water/steam
side without the mills and the gas side. Unlike other transient
models, it is validated with steady state plant measurements at
70%, 80%, 94.4% and 100% load. The numerical results obtained
from the model shows a good agreement for those four steady
state points. Nevertheless, no transient validation has been per-
formed due to the lack of experimental data. The quality of the
transient behaviour is uncertain; however the calculated step
load changes have reasonable characteristics.

4.2. Start-up procedures

PThe stress in the thick-walled components like headers or drums
is induced by the change of pressure and temperature during a tran-
sient. These components (see Section 2.3.3) are expensive and dam-
ages can lead to crucial economic losses for the operator. In coal-
fired power plants, the most crucial operation is the start-up when
high gradients in the metal structure occur. Since the stresses in the
drum or headers limit the absolute start-up time, they are of special
interest. In the past, start-up curves of thermal power plants often
designed on operational experience and conservative assumptions.
The use of dynamic simulations tools offered the possibility of opti-
misation of the start-up progress by limiting the stresses in the
thick-walled components. Kr€uger et al. [244,245] published an opti-
mised control concept for the start-up procedure of a drum boiler.
The model is an extended version of the well-known drum boiler
model of Astroem and Bell [246], including economiser, evaporator,
drum, superheater, attemperators and bypass system. The main
focus was the stress reduction in the thick-walled components. The
authors give a very good overview of the start-up procedure as well
as the initial conditions and show the results of standard classic
start-up and a stress-optimised start-up. In Fig. 37, both start-up
procedures are compared. Due an optimised fuel supply and bypass
control, it was possible to shorten the start-up time significantly,

Pwhile keeping the thermal stresses within the required borders. On
the base of this drum steam generator, Franke et al. [247] extended
the generic model for the on-line application in a commercial ther-
mal power plant.

PMeinke et al. [71] developed a detailed model of the 508 MW
hard coal-fired plant located in Rostock, Germany, which includes
all relevant plant components and control schemes. For the model-
ling process, the simulation platform MODELICA and the non-com-
mercial library ThermoPower [248] was used. The focuses in this
study were the additional developed components like two-phase
tanks and the gas side of the steam generator. In order to evaluate
the quality of this model, a comparison of a start-up from 0 to 90%
after 37 h shut down period between the model and operational
data was performed. The given results show a high accuracy of the
240 min long start-up procedure. Fig. 38 illustrates the mass flow
rates and temperatures at the inlet and the outlet of the steam gen-
erator as well as the pressure and temperature at the outlet of SH1.
At the beginning of the simulation, the steam generator operates at
part load recirculation mode and a constant mass flow into the high
pressure system is maintained. It is visible that the developed model
and its corresponding control schemes calculate correctly. Only in
the life steam production between 20 and 40 min, larger differences
occur. The authors used this model to investigate the stress in the
thick-walled components during start-ups and load changes.

4.3. Flexibility increase

PModifications of existing coal-fired power plants are driven by
different reasons and dynamic models can help to investigate new
innovations. Here, detailed models are often used for complete sys-
tem integration of a new control concept or component. A good
example is the work of Roth et al. in 2005 [23] reported of the waste
heat integration into the feedwater preheating system. The authors
employed the simulation software APROS for the modelling of the
392 MW coal-fired power plant. The model itself is comprehensive
and separates into 500 components. The simulation results show
how fast an additional amount of heat could be converted into elec-
tricity. Other models are used for the new control concepts like the
drum boiler model introduced by Peet and Leung [249]. It takes the
boiler, the turbines and the feedwater track into account. The study
includes a good overview of the main steam temperature and the
unit control. The reheat temperature is controlled by dampers in the
second pass of the boiler. With the non-validated model, several
simulation have
load changes
(100(cid:1)95(cid:1)100%, 55(cid:1)95% and 75(cid:1)95%) with different load change
rates and a load rejection calculation. The results for a load change
from 55% to 95% at 5%/min and 75 to 95% at 20% /min are presented
in Fig. 39. The numerical results show that the implemented controls
can maintain pressure, steam temperature and drum level after the
fast load change. Here, a classic advantage of dynamic simulation
tools is visible, i.e. the investigation of the plant response during a
load change with 20%/min with a numerical model has much less
risks.

been performed,

including

PIn order to optimise the control strategy of a 600 MW supercriti-
cal pulverized coal-fired power plant, Mohmand et al. [118] used a
MATLAB/SIMULINK model with fuel, feedwater and main steam
position as input parameters. The focus is on the water/steam side
leaving the gas side completely out of the model by converting the
fuel flow directly into heat. The reported results, like the main steam
mass flow rate and temperature during a load change from 350 to
600 MW in Fig. 40, look promising. The results and the operational
data during this specific load change have very little derivations and
the implemented control circuits behave like the original ones. Sev-
eral assumptions for model simplification have been applied, which
limit the model for other or more complex purposes.

PThe model published by Meinke et al. [71] was extended in order
to evaluate faster load change rates [65]. Here, the regular load
change rate (2%/min) was doubled (4%/min) and the corresponding
steam temperatures and the induced thermal stresses were ana-
lysed. In Ref. [65], it was shown clearly that a load change from 37%
to 100% with a doubled change rate results in unfavourable fluctua-
tion in the steam temperatures. With an optimised control strategy

Pof the load change, the simulation shows that the steam tempera-
tures can be kept within reasonable limits. Zehtner et al. [24] devel-
oped a model of the 450 MW hard coal thermal power plant Zolling,
Germany in 2008 using the commercial simulation tool APROS. Even
though the need for flexibility improvement of existing power plants
in Germany was not key motivation for this study, the model was
one of the first large detailed models that are used to investigate the
dynamic response of the hard coal thermal power plant. The model
describes the water/steam side in detail, while the gas side is not
modelled in detail as in later published studies [71,21]. The model of
Zehtner et al. [24] used to evaluate the power plant response for sec-
ondary frequency control applying different condensate throttling
variants and feedwater oversteering. Here, the standard condensate
throttling procedure of the thermal power plant, simulated with the
model, shows a good agreement with the operational data (see Fig.
41). The model also includes a stress and fatigue calculation of the
thick-walled components. A more detailed description of the numer-
ical model and the corresponding simulation results are given in
[25].

PThe recently published study by Starkloff et al. [21] of a large hard
once-through coal-fired power plant in Germany focused on the
model description and the validation of the numerical model with
operational data. Therefore, a negative load change from 100% to
27.5% is presented, e.g. live steam pressure during the load change
and the O2 content in the flue gas downstream of the regenerative
air preheater (see Fig. 42). Unlike most other models in scientific lit-
erature, the different firing levels in the steam generator are mod-

Pelled, which offer the possibility of shutting individual levels off.
Since the model was developed for flexibility increase in general, it
is modelled with minimal boundary conditions and realistic control
schemes. The validated model is prepared to investigate most think-
able flexibility increasing measures.

PRichter et al. [250] used the simulation tool MODELICA for flexibi-
lisation of coal-fired power plants. By contrast to the study in [71],
the ClaRa library is applied. The described unit and the fuel are not
specified. The structure of the water/steam side and the steam gen-
erator is detailed and comparable to [71] or [21]. However, the dif-
ferent firing levels are not discretised. The dynamic behaviour is
validated with operational data during a load change from 60 to 90
to 75% within 100 min of an unknown unit (see Fig. 43). Even though
the simulation and the experimental data show a good agreement,
some derivations are visible. The authors explained them due to the
fact of simplification of the unit control, where the developed model
is used to evaluate an energy storage system within the water/steam
cycle. The shown concept gives an idea of the future role of thermal
energy storage systems in the power plant process.

PThe supercritical model developed by Zindler et al. [251] was
generated in order investigate the British grid code. In the non-com-
mercial software Enbipro, a very simplified model of the steam gen-
erator and the water/stem side has been generated. Unfortunately,
there is no validation of the model performance at all.

4.4. Oxyfuel concept

PIn the last decade, the carbon capture and storage (CCS) technol-
ogy, which has a significant CO2 reduction potential, moved into the
focus of scientist and industry [252,253]. One of the CCS technolo-
gies is the combustion of a fuel with a nitrogen-free oxidant. Air is
therefore separated into nitrogen and 95% pure oxygen, employing
an air separation unit. The oxygen enriched air is burned together
with recirculated flue gas in order to keep the flame temperature in
the range of conventional power plants. A challenge for the design
and operation of an oxyfuel coal-fired power plant is the flue gas
side with its complex recirculation path, the air separation and the
gas processing unit. Unfortunately, the design and operation experi-
ences of large conventional thermal power plants can be only partly
applied since whole structure of the gas side is quite different. Fur-
thermore, the experiences of oxyfuel pilot facilities can be only
partly adopted for large-scale power plants due to test plants charac-
ter and inadequate knowledge of the real process. Therefore, one-
dimensional dynamic process simulation offers the possibilities to
evaluate different scenarios and to develop control strategies for the
new process. There are different designs for commercial large-scale
oxyfuel coal-fired power plants; nevertheless the basic structure of
the recirculation path is basically similar. The proposed models are
mostly complex and reasonable detailed. Most works concentrate

Pmore on the model itself than on the results like in [254], where very
detailed model of an 800 MW oxyfuel coal-fired power plant was
presented. Here, the oxygen boiler is coupled with an air separation
unit and the gas processing unit. However, no results of an air to
oxygen switch were given.

PRecently, Jin et al. [255,256] described a dynamic model of
600 MW oxyfuel power plant using ASPEN Plus DYNAMICS. The
model is very detailed on the gas side and the water/steam side,
respectively. A various number of simulations carried out like
responses to disturbances in coal feed or oxygen purity. The pro-
posed switch over from air to oxygen and vice versa occurs at the
nominal load of 100%. The proposed procedure is capable to switch
from air to oxygen firing within 17 min at recycle ratio of 0.7. In their
work, the responses of the products SO2, SO3, CO, NO, NO2 are illus-
trated, which may peak like NOx during the switch over procedure.
Here, the chemical background and the good database of chemical
reaction parameters of ASPEN Plus DYNAMICS is very supportive.
The results also indicate the changing of the flue gas composition
and the higher heat capacity that leads to lower gas temperatures at
the end of the switch over (see Fig. 44). However, it is not reported,
if the dynamic behaviour of the gas temperatures has an impact on
the steam parameters.

PApart from oxyfuel coal-fired power plants with pulverised coal
furnace, the circulated fluidized bed boiler is another option for a
large-scale application of an oxyfuel power plant. Consequently,
dynamic models of CFB plants were developed [257,258]. Complex
models of air fired CFB models are given in [259,260]. The study of a
large CFB power plant published by Lappalainen et al. [258] gives
several CFB specific aspects in an oxyfuel environment. The simula-
tion software APROS is used to model and investigate the air to oxy-
gen switch. In addition to switch over from air to oxygen and from
oxygen to air, the sensitivity of the mode switching to disturbances

P(malfunction of the coal feed, low oxygen purity or wrong oxygen
measurement) is evaluated. The authors reported relevant observa-
tions, showing the model performance. An oxygen content measure-
ment in a power plant with an error of 10% may lead to serious
problems since the recirculation of the flue gas amplifies the effect
drastically. The oxygen content in the flue gas and the oxidant are of
high importance for the safe of operation of such a power plant and
a high quality of control is required. Under safety aspects, a well-
engineered numerical model is tool with a high potential. Safety
aspects are also in the work of Postler et al., who discussed in [27]
the design of a planned 250 MW plant at Jaenschwalde, Germany.
They presented a load change and the impact of a recirculation fan
trip followed by a master fuel trip of the power plant. Interactions of
the fans, the behaviour furnace pressure and the corresponding
mass flow rate are visualized in Fig. 45 (top). Starkloff et al. [26]
extended the Postler et al. model [27] and simulated a total blackout
auf the power plant (see Fig. 45 (bottom)). The dynamic simulations
of malfunctions can help to evaluate and design controls and safety
mechanisms for this new process. Damper position, driving time or
safety sequences can be optimised. Postler [28] described the switch
from air to oxygen operation at 50% boiler load using the software
APROS. The procedure needs around 30 min, which is comparable to
[256] and [258].

PThe air separation unit and the gas processing unit are often
modelled as a boundary condition for the oxyfuel power plant, e.g.
[27,28,256,258]. The dynamic performance of these air separation
units can be the limiting factor of the overall dynamic performance.
The integration of air separation unit with its control system in the
entire oxyfuel power plant model is of high interest. Pottmann et al.
[158] used the commercial software UniSim and the in-house tool
OPTISIM in order to model the gas processing unit and the air sepa-
respectively. The presented results give a good
ration unit,

Pcompartments around the cooling circuit play a major role and are
modelled as well.

PAnother typical application of dynamic simulation tools in the
context of nuclear power plants is the training of the licensed
staff for normal operation as well as unexpected plant transients.
These trainings are usually conducted in life-size replicates of
the control rooms allowing for a very realistic training environ-
ment with the possibility of recreating a broad variety of scenar-
ios.

PThis chapter of the review delves into dynamic simulation
applied to NPPs, namely the analysis of load changes and the safety
analysis. Typical computer codes used for those tasks are presented
and exemplary results are shown and discussed. Moreover, this
chapter gives an overview of upcoming developments in the field of
dynamic simulation of nuclear power plants.

5.1. Specific features

PFirstly, a short introduction to the unique aspects of nuclear
power plants compared to conventional thermal power plants is
offered. This includes the basic principle of nuclear fission as well as
the design features of the most common plant types.

P5.1.1. Basic principle

PThe underlying principle for every nuclear power plant is the
nuclear fission of heavy elements. In Fig. 46, this is shown for 235U as
fuel. The uranium nucleus reacts, in the case of 235U, with a thermal
neutron and is split into two smaller nuclei and about 2 to 3 new
fast neutrons. At the same time, a considerable amount of energy
(about 200 MeV) is released. The fast neurons have to be decelerated
by a moderator to be able to initiate the next fission reaction. Other
fuels that use thermal neutrons for the reaction are 239Pu and 233Th.
Both are artificially produced in so-called breeder reactors. A fuel
that uses fast neutrons for the reaction is 238U. In this case no moder-
ator is needed.

PSeveral different types of nuclear power plants have been
designed and built based on the principle described above. They dif-
fer in the type of coolant (e.g. water, helium, CO2, sodium), mod-
erator (e.g. light water, heavy water, graphite and none in case
of fast breeder reactors) and the number of cooling circuits. The
most common reactor types are light water reactors, namely the
boiling water reactor (BWR) with one cooling circuit and the
pressurized water reactor (PWR) with two cooling circuits. Fur-
thermore the designs of BWR and PWR concepts vary from one
manufacturer to another.

PIn addition more uncommon reactor types, like the Canadian
heavy water reactor or the French sodium cooled fast breeder reac-
tor Superphenix, exist. The former one uses natural uranium omit-
ting the need for the highly complex enrichment process. The latter
one is able to make use of the 238U that which is accounts for 99.3%
of the isotopes in natural uranium. Due to the predominance in
power generation this review focuses on BWR and PWR power
plants.

P5.1.2. Reactor pressure vessel and reactor core

PThe reactor core is the central part of the power plant. There the
nuclear fission takes place and the energy stored in the fuel is
released. The layout is similar for PWR and BWR and therefore is
described jointly. In light water reactors the core is located in the
reactor pressure vessel. It is made up from fuel assemblies which in
turn consist of a set of fuel rods filled with sintered UO2 pellets. In
between the fuel assemblies control rods, made of neutron absorb-
ers, can be moved in and out in order to control the neutron flux and
hence the reactor power.

PIn Fig. 47, typical layouts of a PWR reactor pressure vessel (RPV)
and a BWR RPV are depicted. The control rod drives are installed on

blackout of the power plant (bottom) (reproduced from references [26,27] with per-
mission of authors and Elsevier).

Pimpression how the numerical models may be used for the develop-
ment of control and operation strategies.

5. Nuclear power

PThe first commercial nuclear power plants (NPPs) came into
operation in the 1950s. The two oil crises in 1973 and 1979 led to
the demand of an oil-independent and cheap energy source, which
spiked the number of newly built NPPs worldwide. Since then NPPs
have become a major source of power generation. To date over 430
commercial nuclear power reactors operate in 31 countries with an
installed power of about 370 GW, providing more than 2400 TWh of
electricity per year. This equals roughly 11% of the annual consump-
tion in electricity worldwide [261]. Today, new plants are still
designed, planned and built. Two main driving forces behind those
projects can be identified. Firstly,
in regard of global warming
nuclear power is considered as one of the possible measure to signif-
icantly decrease the amount of emitted carbon dioxide. Secondly,
nuclear power is a relatively import-independent power source
since comparably cheap and little amounts of fuel are needed, which
are available in a number of regions all over the world and not used
in any competing sector [262]. The second factor is closely linked to
the very low marginal cost of nuclear power, which in turn usually
puts NPPs to the far left of the merit order. Therefore, NPPs are
generally used as base load plants without the need for regular
load changes. Only in a few countries, e.g. France and Germany,
NPPs are extensively used for load following. This led to a low
demand of dynamic process simulation of NPPs during load
changes [263,264].

PNevertheless nuclear safety is a main topic during design and
operation since the erection of the first commercial plants. The mat-
ter became increasingly important over time and first computational
analyses of the dynamic behaviour of the plants during accident con-
ditions were conducted very early. Today, several sophisticated pro-
gram codes for nuclear power plants exist, which can model the
transient behaviour of the cooling circuits and the reactor core. Espe-
cially for loss of coolant accidents (LOCA) the interactions of

Pit rises through the core and evaporates. Above the core in the steam
separator the liquid is diverted to the downcomer, while the satu-
rated steam leaves the RPV at the top.

PThe power of a nuclear reactor is controlled via the neutron flux.
In light water reactors an inherent control mechanism exists
because of a temperature feedback loop. With higher temperatures,
the density and therefore the moderation of water decreases. At the
same time, the construction materials and the fuel pellets absorb
more neutrons. Both effects reduce the thermal neutron flux and
hence reactor power.

PBeyond that mechanism the power is controlled by the control
rod position and the boron concentration in PWR. In BWR no boron
is used in the coolant and the power is controlled mainly with the
recirculation pumps. At higher throughputs, the void is reduced,
resulting in better moderation and increased reactor power.

P5.1.3. Cooling circuits and auxiliary systems

PThe PWR concept is used in most of the nuclear power plants in
the world. It is a light water reactor with two cooling circuits. The
main components of the primary circuit are the RPV with the reactor
core, the main coolant loops, each with their own steam generator
and main coolant pump, and a pressurizer (see Fig. 48). The number
of loops varies from two to four. Typical pressure levels for the pri-
mary circuit are around 16 MPa.

PThe steam generators produce saturated steam at about 7 MPa
for the secondary circuit. The layout is similar to any other steam
power process (see Fig. 49) with a few variations. Firstly, because
of the comparably low pressure there are only two turbine
stages. Secondly, the superheater is powered by the main steam.
This actually lowers the plant efficiency but is necessary to limit
the steam moisture to an acceptable level for the low pressure
turbine.

PSeveral safety and auxiliary systems are integrated in the stan-
dard PWR concepts. The actual design, the purposes and the names
differ between plant manufacturers. To give an overview only the
most important systems are explained in the following. Several
safety systems are subsumed under the name Emergency Core Cool-
ing System (ECCS). They are used to remove the decay heat of the

Ptop of the RPV. The main coolant is injected through inlet nozzles,
flows through the downcomer to the bottom of the core and rises
through the core. There, the heat from the fuel assemblies is
absorbed. The coolant leaves the RPV through the outlet nozzles. In
contrast to the PWR, the control rod drives are located below the
RPV. The feedwater is injected above the core. With recirculation
pumps, the water is pumped down to the lower plenum from, where

Preactor core both after regular shut down as well as reactor scram
under accident conditions. It is therefore designed as a highly reli-
able and redundant system with emergency power supply. The ECCS
is connected to the primary circuit. Typical safety systems of the
ECCS are the High Pressure Injection System (HPIS), the Accumulator
Injection System (AIS), and the Low Pressure Injection System (LPIS).
The HPIS and the LPIS are both pump driven systems, which supply
coolant at different pressure levels of the primary reactor. The AIS
depends on pressurized accumulators, which release the inventory
through a check valve into the primary circuit.

PThe emergency feedwater or auxiliary feedwater system (AFS) is
connected to the secondary circuit and supplies feedwater to the
steam generators if the main feedwater pumps are inoperable. This
can be the case during regular start-up and shut-down procedures
as well as accident conditions.

PThe boiling water reactor is the second most common reactor
type. In contrast to the PWR, it consists only of one circuit. Here, the
reactor pressure vessel also acts as a steam generator and supplies
the main steam directly to the turbine. The layout of the cooling cir-
cuit is almost identical to the secondary circuit of a PWR. Also the
pressure level of approximately 7 MPa is similar.

PIn BWR, the ECCS typically consists of a HPIS and a LPIS. Further-
more, BWR plants contain a pressure control and relief system. It is
used to release the pressure form the RPV in accident scenarios to
avoid a plant of condition of a high pressure core meltdown at all
cost. The steam is lead to a condensation chamber, also called pres-
sure suppression pool, where it is condensed. This system is also
used in case of breaks to reduce the pressure in the containment
[265].

5.2. Safety analysis

PThe build and operation of NPPs is strongly regulated by the
authorities in any country and the safety regulations usually exceed
the regulations for conventional thermal power plants by far.
Despite the fact that several standards exist basic safety philosophy
and requirements are similar. Examples for safety requirements are
the German “Sicherheitsanforderungen an Kernkraftwerke” [266],
the US NRC Requirements, the IAEA Safety Standards [267] and the
yet to be passed European WENRA Reference Levels.

PTwo general approaches for safety analyses are differentiated in
the safety standards, the probabilistic approach and the determin-
istic approach. In the probabilistic approach, initiating events are
defined and the accident sequences are analysed respecting the fault
probability of the plant systems. Hereby, an initiating event is any
incident that requires an automatic or operator action to bring the
plant into a safe and steady state condition [268]. The final result of
the calculation is a core damage frequency. In the deterministic
approach, a set of design-basis accidents as well as beyond-design-
basis accidents is examined and the event sequence is determined
under conservative boundary conditions [269]. Typical scenarios
that are investigated in the deterministic approach are loss of cool-
ant accidents (LOCA), loss of offsite power and earthquakes.

PIn both cases, probabilistic and deterministic approach, an exten-
sively tested and validated simulation tool is needed for the simula-
tion of the accident sequence in order to convince the surveyors and
the regulatory authorities of compliance with the regulations. There-
fore, only few dynamic simulation programs, which are specifically
validated for these use cases, are used in the supervisory procedures.
Common codes are ATHLET [270], CATHARE [271] and RELAP
[272,273].

PAll these codes share the two-phase heterogeneous flow model
with the addition of non-condensable gases transport equations and
1D-discretisation. Moreover, the application in the field of safety
analysis not only requires the simulation of the water/steam process
but also the interactions with the neutron kinetics of the nuclear

Preactor, in case of reactor transients and the interactions with the
surrounding building and compartments (containment codes), in
case of loss of coolant accidents. This is achieved either by incorpo-
rating additional simulation modules or by linking the software to
external simulation programs.

PThe simulation of the surrounding building with its compart-
ments is done with very simplified models or with very simplified
discretisation, nevertheless validated with numerous experiments.
An example of an external program for containment simulation is
COCOSYS [274], typically linked to ATHLET. Other examples are
GOTHIC and CONTAIN. The thermal hydraulic is usually described
with a so-called lumped-parameter model. The containment of the
plant is subdivided into control volumes with the thermodynamic
state defined only by temperature and mass of the specified compo-
nents. Typically different zone models are available. For instance, in
COCOSYS equilibrium and non-equilibrium (two-phase) zones and
special zones for the pressure suppression pool in BWR or the jet
vortex condenser in the Russian WWER-440 PWR can be selected.

P5.2.1. Validation experiments

PThe validation of the nuclear reactor simulation codes is based on
separate effect tests, integral system tests and transients in commer-
cial plants. In 1983, a program was initiated by the OECD to compile
code validation matrices. Phenomena were identified that are
expected to occur during transients in BWR and PWR. The integral
test facilities (ITF) and separate effect test facilities (SETF) were built
and experiments, useful to characterize the phenomena identified,
were conducted. The results of several tens of ITF experiments and
about a thousand SETF experiments are compiled in [275,276]. Vali-
dation results of containment codes are summarized in [277,278].

PThe reports provide a general overview of accident progression
for light water and also heavy water reactors. The main focuses are
the phenomena and safety systems employed in these reactor types
and to highlight the differences. For example, in the report for the
containment code validation approximately 120 phenomena in the
categories of containment thermal hydraulic, hydrogen behaviour,
aerosol and fission products, iodine chemistry, core melt distribution
and system behaviour are identified and a synopsis of more than 200
experiments for those six categories are included.

PAn example for a cross reference matrix is shown in Table 3. It
allows identifying what phenomena are covered by which test and
are suitable for code assessment, in this case for large break LOCAs
in PWR. The actual validation is then conducted with pre(cid:1)test and
post(cid:1)test calculations that are compared to the experiment results.
Since the compilation of these reference matrices, more phenomena
were marked as important and additional experiments were con-
ducted.

PRevent(cid:3)os et al. [280] illustrated the general approach in code
validation, where some parameters are determined with a
parameter study and then the experiments results are compared
to the simulation results. Here, the result of one of the OECD-
SETH experiments is compared to the results of ATHLET and dif-
ferent RELAP versions. The OECD-SETH program is aimed at
investigating issues that are relevant to accident prevention and
started in 2001. The experiment in question deals with the topic
of boron dilution on resumption of natural circulation in the
steam generators following a small break LOCA. This scenario
constitutes a challenge to analytical methods. The water evapo-
rates within the core and condenses on the primary side of the
steam generators. In this so called reflux condenser mode the
boron is mainly retained in the liquid phase, so that the vapour
phase and the condensate are almost boron free. The boron dilu-
tion is an important phenomenon because recriticality can occur
if the diluted plug enters the core.

PThe experiment was conducted in the integral test facility PKL
(see Fig. 50), which is operated at the Technical Center of AREVA and

Pis a mock-up of a 1300 MW class PWR [280,281]. The test facility
simulates the entire primary side with four loops and the essential
parts of the secondary side. The elevations correspond to the eleva-
tions in an actual plant and the volumina and power are scaled
1:145.

PThe analyses were performed by six working groups from differ-
ent countries using different codes. The aim of this paper was to
both show and compare the results obtained by different working
groups in their simulation of the experiment and to analyse the main
parameters involved in order to draw conclusions on improvements
that can be made in the analytical approach to such tests. All the par-
ticipants managed to successfully predict the overall thermal hydrau-
lic system behaviour. Vessel fill-up together with slug build-up by
reflux-condensation (see Fig. 51) up to 3000 s after start of the tran-
sient are phenomena that were correctly predicted, whereas simula-
tion of natural circulation restart and transport of low-borated water
slugs (see Fig. 52) were identified as areas for improvement.

PIn conclusion, the validation of nuclear system codes is a very
broad and well discussed topic. The validation matrices allow for
a thorough test of new and changed codes and ongoing
researches ensure that newly identified phenomena are consid-
ered and experiments are added.

P5.2.2. Statistical accident analyses

PThe accident scenarios that need to be analysed in order to
receive an operating license are called design basis accidents
(DBA). Usually these are divided into two groups, loss of coolant
accidents (LOCA) and accidents or transients without loss of
coolant. For both it has to be proven, that certain criteria would
not be exceeded.

PThis is typically done in a deterministic analysis by setting
conservative values for the boundary conditions like reactor
power, reactor pressure and burn-up of the fuel (higher burn-up
yields higher decay heat). The calculations are performed
with the validated codes that are best-estimate codes, i.e. the
model parameters are not chosen in a way that necessarily
yields conservative results but are set to match the validation
experiments. Due to the choice of conservative boundary condi-
tions, the calculated result is nevertheless assumed to be a cov-
ering or conservative result
for the respective performance
criteria.

PIn a more recent approach that is propagated in the USA Code of
Federal Regulation and the German Sicherheitsanforderungen, the
boundary conditions are no longer set to values considered
conservative but are given as probability distributions. The

omit one or two outliers respectively. On the other hand, the
results of the probabilistic method are more realistic and allow
for an assessment of result's uncertainties. Additionally the influ-
ence of model parameters with a fixed but inaccurately known
value is reflected in the result. The difference between the two

PArkoma et al. [30] analysed a large break loss-of-coolant accident
(LB-LOCA) in EPR-type nuclear power plants using the described sta-
tistical method. The best-estimate code used is APROS coupled with
the fuel-performance code FRAPTRAN-GENFLO. The goal of the anal-
ysis was to show that the maximum number of failing fuel rods in
the reactor core in the transient is lower than the performance crite-
rion of 10% of failed rods. The failing of the fuel rods is mainly deter-
mined by the cladding temperature of the fuel rod.

PThe 59 results for the maximum fuel cladding temperature are
plotted in Fig. 54 together with six additional curves: the highest
and lowest temperatures in black, the average temperature in blue,
and the median in turquoise for each time step as well as the results
of two extra calculations with the nominal and conservative values
for the model parameters and boundary conditions in green and red
respectively. The lowest and highest temperatures at each time step
are represented with the black lines.

PA clear reason why certain calculations gave high and low
extreme values could not be found. More over the conservative case
in which conservative input values were chosen based on engineer-
ing judgement did not lead to the absolute highest cladding
temperatures. Several other paper on the topic of statistical
accident analysis also draw the conclusion, that parameter combina-
tions considered conservative do not necessarily lead to a conserva-
tive result.

PThis emphasizes the advantages of the statistical analysis in com-
plex systems, where the interactions between different input param-
eters are hard to predict. Therefore, the reviewers suggest a transfer
of the knowledge in statistical transient analysis from the nuclear
energy branch into other fields of study with dynamic simulations.

5.3. Load cycling

PAs briefly described in the introduction, load cycling has not yet
played a major role for nuclear power plants since NPPs are gener-
ally used as base load plants. The reasons are manifold and include
technical as well as economical aspects. Therefore, no dynamical
simulations of the power generation process during normal opera-
tion are known to the authors. Nevertheless, experience with load
following exist.

P5.3.1. Experience with load following

PA comprehensive overview on the experience with load follow-
ing in France, Germany, USA and Sweden as well as on the technical
aspects of load changes in BWR and PWR is given by Persson et al.
[283]. The goal of the report was to elicit the capability to comple-
ment the fluctuating power supply of renewable energies with the
NPPs in Sweden. In order to achieve this goal, technical aspects that
were regarded important for load following, were investigated.
These include:

P(cid:3) Thermal stress on the components, leading to increased plant

wear,

P(cid:3) The limit in neutron flux control, usually caused by limited con-

trol rod drive speed,

P(cid:3) The requirements for the in-core instrumentation,
P(cid:3) Risk of fuel damage caused be different thermal expansion coeffi-

cients for the fuel pellets and the surrounding fuel rod,

P(cid:3) The so called xenon peak that occurs a few hours after a load

reduction and prevents the return to the nominal power,
P(cid:3) Increased risk of incidents leaving normal operation, and
P(cid:3) The effect on the fuel economy.

PLudwig et al. [284] conducted a comparable study for German
NPPs only. The motivation for this paper was the decision of the Ger-
man government in favour of a lifetime extension for the German
NPPs and the question if those plants can readily react to changes in
load demand. The authors identified similar fields of interest to
investigate the fast response capabilities. Additionally, the part-load
characteristics of German PWR and BWR are explained.

PIn Fig. 55, a schematic part load diagram of a PWR is shown. For a
reactor power from 0 to 40% of the nominal power, the average cool-
ant temperature rises. Here a load following would yield high ther-
mal stress on the components in the primary circuit. Between 40%
and 100% of the nominal reactor power, the average coolant temper-
ature in the reactor is constant. This is therefore the typical range for
load following.

Fig. 56. Schematic characteristic curve for recirculation control in a German BWR
(reproduced from reference [284] with permission of AREVA NP GmbH).

PIn Fig. 56, the recirculation control curve in a BWR is depicted
for constant control rod position. Recirculation control is per-
fectly suitable for load cycling in the upper power range from
about 60% to 100% of the rated electrical output. Hereby the
power distribution is not significantly affected minimizing the
stress on the reactor components. For lower power output, the
control rod manoeuvring sequence has to be optimised. Under
these conditions load-following operation between 20% and
100% is expected to be feasible.

PBoth studies draw the conclusion that in principle there are no
technical obstacles to use the nuclear power plants in Sweden and
Germany for flexible power generation in load following with mini-
mum load of 65% and 50% respectively. Both reports also suggest
that higher rates and ranges are possible with suitable changes like
optimised fuel management, optimised control rod manoeuvring
and predictive operating strategies [283,284].

PAn exemplary overview on the maximum load change rate and
on the load cycling range for some of the current light water reactor
designs is given in Table 4.

P5.3.2. Thermal hydraulic-neutronic instabilities

PThe aforementioned studies as well as similar works (Pouret et al.
[263], Stein and Griffith [290]) omit the topic of coupled thermal
hydraulic-neutronic instabilities that can occur in boiling water
reactors. In most power plants, provisions are taken against these by
prohibiting certain combinations of control rod position and low
recirculation pump speed and thus limit the load cycling range. This

PAs several in-depth reviews on the topic of thermal hydraulic
instabilities exist (e.g. March-Leuba and Rey [291], Prasad et al.
[292], Ruspini et al. [293]), no further details are given. Nevertheless,
as load following is becoming more relevant with the addition of
fluctuating renewable energy sources, thermal hydraulic instabilities
during reactor transients should not be neglected.

6. Concentrated solar power

PIn concentrated solar power (CSP) plants, solar rays are concen-
trated by means of mirrors or lenses or a combination of both to
heat a working fluid, which then directly or indirectly drives a ther-
modynamic process in order to generate electric power. In this chap-
ter, only concentrated solar thermal power is discussed, while
concentrated photovoltaics (CPV) and plants with non-concentrating
collectors are out of scope.

Fig. 57. Instability region in the power-flow map for the Leibstadt NPP (reproduced
from reference [331]).

Pis shown in Fig. 57 for the NPP Leibstadt in Switzerland. The effect of
thermal hydraulic-neutronic instabilities is widely known since the
1980s when such instabilities were observed at the Caorso plant in
Italy.

PThe basic mechanism causing flow instabilities in BWRs is the
density wave. The coolant in BWRs flows in the upward direction
through the core. Thus, variations in the density, caused by dif-
ferent steam void fractions, travel upwards with the flow.
In
two-phase flow regimes, the local pressure drop is very sensitive
to the local void fraction and a significant part of a pressure
drop is delayed with respect to the original perturbation. If the
inlet flow is perturbed at certain frequencies, the pressure drop
can decrease with increasing flow and a self-sustained oscillation
can occur [291].

PIn addition, in BWRs the power generation is directly linked to the
neutron flux which is a function of the reactivity feedback and there-
fore depends on the void fraction. Thus a density or pressure oscilla-
tion respectively is necessarily accompanied by a power or neutron
flux oscillation. The feedback paths are illustrated in Fig. 58 [291].

PThe overall efficiency of a CSP plant (see Fig. 59) is determined by
the optical efficiency of the reflector, the efficiency of the receiver
(absorber tube), the thermal losses during fluid transport, thermal
energy storage efficiency (optional) and the efficiency of energy con-
version in the power block [294].

PThe heat transfer fluid (HTF) is usually a synthetic oil. The size of
the solar field determines the amount of electric output. As the solar
field roughly accounts for half of the capital expenditure for a CSP
plant, current research efforts are focused on increasing electric con-
version efficiency by higher process temperatures in order to down-
size the solar field and decrease the levelised cost of electricity
(LCOE). This requires application of working fluids that remain stable
at high temperatures, such as molten salt or demineralised water, i.e.
direct steam generation (DSG).

ers were commercialised in South West USA and the North-Ameri-

Fig. 59. Typical setup of a concentrated solar power plant (parabolic through) with thermal storage.

PItalian Giovanni Francia designed and built the first linear Fresnel
collector in Genoa, Italy, in 1964 and the first solar tower plant in
Sant'Ilario, Italy, in 1965. As of 2011, 29 CSP plants have been in
operation worldwide with around 1220 MWel
installed capacity
[106]. It can be seen in Fig. 60 that the large majority of the solar
thermal capacity is installed in Spain and the U.S. Furthermore, para-
bolic trough CSP plants are the most widely deployed technology,
followed by tower, linear Fresnel and Stirling dish CSP plants with
huge distance. Growth of installed CSP capacity started in 2009,
mainly in Spain (see Fig. 61). At the end of 2013, the total installed
CSP capacity amounted to 3.6 GW. About 900 MW were newly

Pinstalled in 2013 and a total of 5.5 TWh solar thermal energy
were generated. Spain leads the world in solar thermal energy
with 2.3 GW of cumulative CSP capacity. Close to 2% of annual
electricity in Spain is generated by CSP plants. This is the highest
share of all countries in the world. The U.S. ranks second with
900 MW CSP capacity installed at the end of 2013. However,
deployment of CSP grows at a high pace in the U.S. with
400 MW being added in 2013 and over 600 MW in early 2014
[295]. The Ivanpah central receiver plant in California, consisting
of three distinct towers with each operating its own power
block, is the largest CSP plant with respect to installed capacity

6.2. Specific features

PCSP plants generally consist of a solar field, an energy storage sys-
tem (optional) and a power block as described in the following sec-
tions.

P6.2.1. Solar field

PThere are different CSP technologies that are mainly distin-
guished by concentrator and receiver systems, see Fig. 62. Parabolic
trough and linear Fresnel reflectors concentrate direct sunlight on a
line (line focus), whereas parabolic dish and solar tower technolo-
gies concentrate light on a point (point focus) [106]. Furthermore,
linear Fresnel and the solar tower technology have in common that
the receiver is fixed and does not move together with the concentra-
tor device. This reduces the effort of HTF transport to the power
block. In contrast, the receiver of parabolic trough and parabolic dish
technology is mobile. In general, a mobile receiver allows collecting
more energy compared to a fixed receiver [296].

P(cid:3) Parabolic trough (PT) collectors: This technology focuses solar
rays through parabolic trough-shaped mirrors on linear receiver
tubes along the parabola's focal line (see Fig. 62-(a)). These
receiver tubes are isolated in evacuated glass envelopes. Oil is
heated inside the tubes and further transferred to a power block.
The parabolic trough technology was used in the first commercial
plants built in California and is still most widely deployed [294].
In addition to synthetic oil as heat transfer fluid, more recent
projects investigate the deployment of direct steam generation
(DSG) collectors to improve performance and reduce costs [297].
One small parabolic trough plant with DSG technology is cur-
rently operating in Thailand [296]. The thermal efficiency of par-
abolic trough collectors is relatively low. Operating temperatures
range from 50 °C to 400 °C with concentration ratios between 15
and 45 [298]. Single-axis tracking is common. However, double-
axes tracking could increase the amount of collected solar energy
by up to 46% compared to a fixed surface (experimental investi-
gation by Bakos) [299]. The overall technology maturity can be
considered as advanced with relatively low costs [298].

P(cid:3) Heliostat field collector (Central receiver system CRS / solar
tower): Multiple heliostat field collectors (large mirrors with dou-
ble-axes tracking) focus solar rays to a fixed tower mounted

Preceiver (see Fig. 62-(b)). This technology emerged as major alter-
native to the parabolic dish technology, since it is characterized by
high theoretical efficiency as well as high potential for future cost
reduction. The high concentration ratios compared to linear focus-
ing systems allow the receiver to operate at higher temperatures
with reduced losses [294]. The capacity is limited by the heat flux
that can be absorbed by the receiver surface and transferred to
the heat transfer fluid, without overheating receiver walls and
heat transfer fluid [299]. As already stated, the thermal efficiency
of central receiver systems is relatively high. Operating tempera-
tures range from 300 °C to 2000 °C with concentration ratios
between 150 and 1500. Double-axes tracking of the heliostats is
common. Overall, the technology is still relatively immature,
implying high specific costs [298].

P(cid:3) Linear Fresnel reflector (LFR): Linear Fresnel CSP plants use mul-
tiple mirrors moving on one axis. These mirrors focus the solar
rays on a downward facing fixed linear receiver (see Fig. 62-(c)).
All commercial LFR plants currently in operation use DSG. There
is one 30 MW LFR plant operating in Spain since early 2012 and
one 125 MW commercial LFR plant operating in India since 2014.
The technology is characterized through a simple design but low
overall optical and thermal efficiency [294], especially when the
sun is low in the sky in early morning and late afternoons and
during winter [296]. Operating temperatures range from 50 to
300 °C with concentration ratios between 10 and 40. Single-axis
tracking of the reflectors is common. Overall, the technological
maturity can be considered as moderate. However, relative costs
are the lowest due to its simple design [298].

P(cid:3) Parabolic dish reflector: This technology uses an array of para-
bolic dish-shaped mirrors to focus solar energy on a receiver
located at the common focal point of the dish mirrors [299]. A
heat-to-electricity engine, such as a Stirling motor or micro-tur-
bine connected to a generator, is located at the common focal
point (see Fig. 62-(d)). Parabolic dish technology is characterized
by the highest efficiency potential for solar energy conversion of
all CSP technologies (no cosine losses [294]), low start-up losses
and favourable modularity, so that the dish can be easily installed
in remote areas to meet the local power requirements. The tech-
nology requires three-dimensional tracking, rendering systems
more complex and reducing tracking accuracy [299]. However,
very high costs and risks caused the parabolic dishes to disappear
almost completely from the commercial energy landscape [296].
Recently, parabolic dish resurrected as option for future CSP con-
cepts. Operating temperatures range from 150 °C to 1500 °C with

Pconcentration ratios between 100 and 1000. Overall, the technol-
ogy maturity is low [298].

P6.2.2. Power block

PDepending on the CSP reflector type with its characteristic oper-
ating temperature, the layout and the specific dispatchability
requirements, CSP plants are equipped with one of the following
power block types:

P(cid:3) Rankine cycle (steam cycle).
P(cid:3) Organic Rankine cycle ORC (low-temperature steam cycle).
P(cid:3) Stirling engines (heat-to-electricity engine).
P(cid:3) Brayton (Joule) cycle (gas turbine cycle).
P(cid:3) Combined-cycle (Brayton combined with Rankine as bottoming

cycle) as described in [300,301].

P6.2.3. Energy storage and back-up system

PAs solar irradiation is limited to daytime and depending on the
clearance of the sky, CSP is generally not dispatchable. However, ther-
mal energy storage (TES) can be integrated in a CSP plant (see Fig.
59), making it highly dispatchable. TES also enables CSP plants to con-
vert the intermittent solar energy source to a constant power output.
Round-trip efficiencies above 97% were reported for TES units consist-
ing of two-tanks with hot and cold salt [302]. Furthermore, a storage
can increase the solar share (fraction of energy provided by solar) by

Pas much as 47% to levels over 70% on a sunny day [303]. The relative
ease of thermal energy storage for high dispatchability is the main
competitive advantage of CSP vis-(cid:2)a-vis photovoltaics.

PIn most applications, the thermal energy storage medium stores
thermal energy in form of sensible heat (heating and cooling a mate-
rial without change of phase), for instance in synthetic oil and molten
salt. However, systems that utilize latent heat (melting and freezing
of suitable high-temperature phase-change materials), thermochemi-
cal (reversible chemical reactions used to store and discharge energy)
and other sensible heat materials are the subject of ongoing research
[302]. Furthermore, energy can be stored in steam accumulators. The
energy density is low for sensible heat storage, whereas the density
increases with latent heat storage, sorption and thermochemical stor-
age. As yet, the maturity level of these storage technologies is in
opposite correlation to their prospective power density.

PTechnical aspects to be considered when evaluating thermal

energy storage technologies are:

P(cid:3) High thermal storage capacity,
P(cid:3) Good heat transfer rate between heat storage material and heat

transfer fluid,

P(cid:3) Good stability of heat storage material to avoid chemical and
mechanical degradation after a certain number of thermal cycles,
P(cid:3) Compatibility between heat transfer fluid, heat exchanger mate-

rial, and storage material,

P(cid:3) Reversibility to achieve large numbers of charging and discharg-

ing cycles,

P(cid:3) Low level of thermal losses,
P(cid:3) Ease of control [299].

PAmong the total installed capacity at the end of 2013, roughly
2.3 GW do not include storage, while approximately 1.3 GW contain
a thermal energy storage system. However, among the expected
capacity to be added until 2020, about 80% will likely incorporate
storage capability [295].

PIn addition to thermal energy storage, back-up systems with fos-
sil fuel or biomass fired auxiliary boilers make CSP plants fully dis-
patchable, which makes the technology more attractive for utilities.
Furthermore, the back-up system can compensate for thermal stor-
age losses during the night, prevent freezing and accelerate the
start-up process in the morning. Almost all CSP plants use some fos-
sil fuel as back-up, most commonly natural gas. As the power block
already exists, the additional costs for an auxiliary boiler are rela-
tively low and they are outweighed by the operational benefits of a
back-up system.

PFinally, several

full-hybrid setups are conceivable. These
hybrid systems routinely use a fuel together with solar energy.
For example, small solar fields can be added to a fossil-fired
thermal power plant (even as re-powering). These integrated
solar combined-cycle (ISCC) plants use solar energy to evaporate
steam for the bottoming cycle. Furthermore, solar boosters for
coal plants replace the economisers that are heated by extraction
flows from the steam turbine. Hence, more steam can be
expanded in the turbine so that power output is boosted [296].
Since the conventional part typically plays the major role in
these systems and the solar part is the auxiliary support, full-
hybrid systems are not further discussed in this work.

6.3. Dynamic studies

PDynamic simulation of CSP plants is conducted as the technology
relies on direct solar radiation, which in fact is dynamic in nature.
Clouding, the angle of irradiation depending on day-time and season
as well as the geographic location of a plant influence the amount of
energy that can be collected. Dynamic simulation aims to study the
performance of CSP plants under different solar irradiance condi-
tions. Furthermore, plant start-up procedures, the capacity and
dynamics of TES charge and discharge cycles as well as the annual
power output respectively the capacity factor can be analysed. Two
different types of studies can be distinguished, which either simulate
based on half to one hour time steps and treat most thermal compo-
nents as quasi-static or which attempt to track short duration cloud
and thermal transients using more fundamental approaches. Key
inputs for system performance forecasting include direct normal
irradiation (DNI) time series data, combined with the local ambient
temperature, humidity and wind speed [294].

PCommercial software for energy system modelling used in solar
thermal applications includes: IPSEpro, EBSILON Professional, Eco-
SimPro, TRNSYS, GATECYCLE, DYMOLA, MATHEMATICA and ASPEN.
A free, but closed-source package is the System Advisor Model (SAM)
from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), which is
based on the well-known TRNSYS simulation engine. An example for
a free open-source system model is SOLERGY (Lovegrove and Stein)
[294]. Recent studies also used the APROS simulation code to model
and simulate a parabolic trough CSP plant (see [35] and [36]). A
detailed overview of codes applicable to CSP technologies is given in
Ho [304]. As parabolic trough CSP plants are most widely deployed,
this technology offers the most reliable base of operating data and is
commonly used to validate dynamic simulation models. Some other
studies investigated the dynamics of central receiver and linear Fres-
nel reflector systems. However, to the authors’ best knowledge there

Pare no studies in the field of dynamic simulation for parabolic dish
systems so far. Table 5 provides an overview about recent publica-
tions on dynamic simulation of CSP systems.

PIn the following, some recent studies that include measurement
validation are selected for detailed description. Garcia et al. [106]
were the first researchers to develop a model based on the 50 MWel
solar thermal power plant Andasol II in Granada, Spain, where the
collected heat is transferred using synthetic oil as heat transfer fluid.
Their simulation is conducted using Wolfram's MATHEMATICA 7
software. The model aims to be flexible in order to analyse different
characteristics of any trough plant. Hence, it is anticipated to use
this model for designing new plants and to optimise operation strat-
egies with respect to maximizing electricity output. Fig. 63 compares
validation results with measurement data of the reference plant for
partly cloudy days.

PThe most recent studies were conducted by Al-Maliki et al. [35,36],
in which the 50 MWel Andasol II plant is also modelled, including all
required control circuits. However, the authors used the thermal
hydraulic simulation code APROS. The model includes a two-tank
thermal energy storage operated with molten salt and a detailed
dynamic model of the power block. After achieving convincing valida-
tion results, it is found that the thermal energy storage enables the
plant to deliver an almost constant power output despite small fluctu-
ations in DNI. Furthermore, the plant is capable of sustained power
generation for 7.5 h after sunset due to the storage. Comparison
between measurement and simulation for a day with strong
cloudy periods (see Fig. 64) shows good agreement in the period
between 10:00 and 17:00. The discrepancies after this period are
related to unknown operator behaviour in particular. With an
optimised operation strategy, the time of electrical power output
can be increased by about 26% compared to the reference case.

PLiu et al. [122] analysed the dynamic behaviour of a TES system
implemented in the 1 MWel central receiver direct steam generation
plant Badaling. The thermal energy storage consists of an oil-oper-
ated cold and hot tank as well as a steam accumulator. The complete
plant is modelled in DYMOLA by means of the MODELICA library
“ThermoSysPro”. A two-level control loop is designed in MATLAB/
SIMULINK and connected to the simulation model. Fig. 65 shows the
results after a dynamic perturbation of DNI. The drum pressure
increases instantaneously when DNI rises. At a certain drum pres-
sure, the system switches to storage mode and the storage steam
valve opens in order to limit the pressure in the drum. The steam
mass flow to the turbine is stabilized with constant drum pressure.
The pressure in the steam accumulator increases as steam is
injected. Not shown in the diagrams is an increase in feedwater sup-
ply to the drum in order to maintain a constant drum level. As the
results illustrate, coupling of the two-level control system modelled
in MATLAB/SIMULINK with the DYMOLA process model is successful.
The authors aim to use the model for prospective studies of further
control solutions in the future.

PMitterhofer and Orosz [81] modelled a low-cost 3 kWel micro-CSP
with a rock-bed TES system in DYMOLA. The solar-thermal loop is
represented by a dynamic model, whereas the model of the Organic
Rankine Cycle is steady state. The model is validated with experi-
mental data from a test site at Eckerd College in St. Petersburg, Flor-
ida. Results show a possible net electricity generation of 4.08 MWh/
annum at an average power output of 2.5 kW and a capacity factor
of 18.8%. Operation of the ORC condenser can be optimised by apply-
ing a control strategy that allows for a variable pinch point, which
results in an increase of annual net electricity generation by 14% in
comparison to a constant condensation pinch point (see Fig. 66).

7. Additional thermal power technologies

to the above-described, that are rarely considered in the dynamic

Psimulation studies. These
include geothermal
power, municipal waste incineration and seawater desalination.
The general lack of in-depth studies for those technologies is
mainly linked to the economics that strongly favour steady state
operation or to the comparatively small market penetration. In
this chapter, the available research on these technologies in the
literature is reviewed.

7.1. Geothermal power

PThe geothermal power plants use heat generated by radioac-
tive decay in the earth, which is removed by accessing natural
hot water reservoirs or by the so called hot-dry-rock process,
where an artificial circulation system between the heat source
and the plant is generated by injecting water into the ground.

PThe retrieved hot water than can either be flashed directly to
drive a Rankine process or the heat is transferred to a secondary
circuit using a working fluid with more favourable evaporation
characteristics. Generally, high temperature geothermal resour-
ces above 150 °C are applied to power generation. Moderate

Ptemperature geothermal resources in the range between 90 °C
and 150 °C and low temperature geothermal resources (below
90 °C) are preferably applied to direct uses. Several novel designs
are proposed recently to generate electricity from moderate or
low temperature resources geothermal resources economically,

Pbut these are not efficient like power generation from high tem-
perature geothermal resources [313].

PDue to the near-zero marginal cost for geothermal power, the
power plants are mostly used for base-load demand and there is
little motivation to investigate transient operation. On the other
hand, a number of studies on the dynamic storage behaviour of
the wells/reservoirs exist, which are typically the limiting factor
for those types of power plants. For example, Casella [314] con-
ducted a study on the modelling, control and optimization of a
double-flash geothermal plant using ProcSim, an in-house code
from Laboratory of the Politecnico di Milano. Within this study,
modelling approaches for components unique to geothermal
power plants, e.g. the stripper columns, are presented and a

Pdynamic model of the plant is generated. Other recent studies
can be found in [47,154].

7.2. Municipal waste incineration

PIn the last few decades and due to the rapid development of
national economies, continued urbanisation and improvement of liv-
ing standard, the solid waste output is constantly increasing. In order
to effectively dispose of solid waste, different solutions have been
suggested such as recycling, reduction of waste generation and land-
fills. A proven approach for the large-scale disposal of municipal
solid waste is the thermal treatment in grate systems. Municipal
waste incineration is characterised by several advantages such as

Pthe cost reduction of residual landfill due to the lower volume of end
products (10% of the original volume) and decreasing the total
organic carbon (TOC) of waste, resulting in inert residues unable to
produce landfill gas. The heat released in waste combustion can be
recovered by a water/steam circuit for the supply of electricity and
district heating. Accordingly, the residual waste can be used as sub-
stitute fuel for the conventional fossil fuels.

PA municipal waste incineration power plant, shown in Fig. 67, con-
sists basically of water/steam side, flue gas path and flue gas cleaning
devices. In a waste bunker, the delivered raw waste is classified and
treated. Here, bulky components are crushed and incombustible
materials are discharged. Using a crane, the waste is transported to
the firing system. The combustion system is composed of a primary

Pcombustion on the grate, a post-combustion zone, in which the
secondary air is injected and a zone with auxiliary burners. The
auxiliary burners are required on the one hand for plant start-up
and on the other hand for supporting the combustion tempera-
ture, when the calorific value of waste is insufficient. On the
grate, the incineration of waste takes place in different zones
using primary air (air/fuel ratio between 0.4 and 1.3). The ther-
mal process steps are drying, pyrolysis, combustion of volatile
matters and burn out of char. During the pyrolysis, the products
of char, tar, gases (e.g. carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and
nitrogen) and volatile organic compounds are basically formed,
which are released in different proportions. The char is the
remaining solid that almost consists of pure carbon. In the post-

wall evaporators, superheaters and economisers.

PMunicipal waste incinerations can also be used to remove the
sewage sludge, which denote the residual by-product of industrial
and municipal wastewater treatment. The dry sewage sludge con-
tains up to 70% organic components and the remaining 30% are com-
posed of, among others, silicates, phosphates, phosphor and heavy
metals. With a heating value of 9 to 12 MJ /kg (dried), more than half
of the sewage sludge in Germany was incinerated in 2010 with the
aim of full thermal treatment in the current decade.

PThe availability and operation efficiency of a municipal waste
incineration can be improved using numerical simulations that can
be divided in one-dimensional process simulation and three-dimen-
sional computational fluid dynamics (CFD). While 3D simulations
are often used for individual components to visualize flow patterns,
1D process simulations can model the entire power plant. In the sci-
entific literature, numerical studies of waste incinerator using CFD
and steady state process simulation were frequently reported. In
contrast, no publication on 1D dynamic simulation of a municipal
waste incineration exists to the authors’ knowledge. For the first
time, dynamic simulation results for a 60 MWth municipal waste
incineration built in Tampere, Finland, are presented in the follow-
ing. The plant burns 5.7 kg/s of waste with an ideal LHV of 10.5 MJ/
kg and discharges 36.3 kg/s of flue gas at 160 °C as well as 0.7 kg/s of
slag at 450 °C. The primary air is fed to the grate through 5 zones at
150 °C, while the secondary air that equates to about 30% of the total
air mass flow rate is then supplied through a series of jets on the
sidewalls of the post-combustion zone at 225 °C. The water/steam
circuit consists of 4 economisers, 7 superheaters and 5 evaporators
with natural circulation. At full load, the superheated steam mass
flow rate at turbine inlet amounts to 20.5 kg/s at 400 °C and 45 bar.
The gross electrical output of the steam turbine is approximately
16 MWel, which yields an electrical gross efficiency of 26.5%. The
dynamic model of the municipal waste incineration was generated
using APROS. The influence of waste heating value variations on the
plant efficiency as well as the dynamic behaviour for both part loads
and start-up procedures were investigated. In Fig. 68, the flue gas
vertical passes including post-combustion zone, auxiliary burners
and membrane wall heat exchangers are displayed.

PFig. 69 shows the temperature profile within the vertical passes
of the municipal waste incineration at full load operation. The y-axis
refers to the height above ground and the x-axis represents the tem-
perature. At the outlet of the primary combustion zone (h D 14 m),
the flue gas temperature is around 1200 °C. In the height range
between h D 14 m and h D 15 m, the temperature of the flue gas
decreases due to the heat transfer to the water-cooled combustion
In the post-combustion zone, the combustion
chamber walls.

Fig. 70. Dynamic behaviour of a waste incineration power plant during start-up proce-
dure: (top) pressure, (bottom) steam mass flow rate (red line, first axis) and gross elec-
trical output of the steam turbine (blue line, second axis). (For interpretation of the
references to colour in the text, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)

Ptemperature decreases sharply due to secondary air supply. The flue
gas enters the second vertical pass at h D 32 m and the third vertical
pass at h D 18 m. Along the flow path, the flue gas temperature
decreases to approximately 700 °C, before the horizontal pass. The
comparison between numerical results and design data shows high
consistency.

PPressure, steam mass flow rate and the gross electrical output of
the steam turbine during start-up procedure of the municipal waste
incineration are depicted in Fig. 70. Approximately 20 min after igni-
tion, the steam pressure reaches a fixed holding point at 15 bar. The
bypass valve to condenser opens in order to counteract any further
pressure rise. Subsequently, the steam mass flow increases sharply
within minutes to 15 kg/s. Between t D 120 min and t D 180 min, the
heat input starts increasing, resulting in higher steam production
rate and thus pressure increase. At t D 145 min, the main steam con-
trol valve to steam turbine starts opening and the bypass valve to
condenser closes in reverse. As a result, the electrical output of the
steam turbine increases to its nominal value of about 16 MWel. The
LHV variation of the solid waste is reflected by fluctuations of the
steam mass flow.

7.3. Seawater desalination

PIn emerging economies especially,

the growing population
together with improved living standard is accompanied by a rapid
increase in clean water demand. Recent studies unanimously expect
that in the future, stress on water availability will rise even more
due to global warming and agricultural irrigation. Desalination of
seawater is an essential part in providing drinking water in arid
regions around the world. In the Gulf Arab states for example, where
drinking water has always been a scarce and precious resource,
most of the fresh water is produced with seawater desalination
plants. Generally, desalination processes can be divided into thermal
processes and membrane processes.

PThe separation technology using membrane is a purely physi-
cal process without heating. For practical application, reverse

Posmosis (RO) that uses a semipermeable membrane is especially
relevant. In reverse osmosis, an external pressure considerably
higher than the osmotic pressure (seawater: 23 bar) is applied
on the side of seawater with high salt concentration. While the
membrane allows the solvent to pass to the other side, it keeps
the solute on the pressurized side. Reverse osmosis desalination
process utilizes electrical power generated by thermal power
plants, e.g. combined-cycle, nuclear power plant and recently
renewable energy sources [315]. Since the large-scale electricity
storage is now related to technical challenges, modern operation
concept of RO desalination offers the ability to use the excess
generation capacity at times of reduced grid demand and/or
increased renawable generation to produce clean water that can
be easily stored in containers [316,317].

PIn thermal processes or distillation processes, part of the sea-
water is evaporated, so that brine with high salt concentration
remains. After condensing the vapour and adding calcium bicar-
bonate and other mineral nutrients to the pure distillate, drink-
ing water is obtained. The thermal processes include multi-stage
flash, multiple-effect evaporation possibly combined with ther-
mal vapour compression. In multi-stage flash desalination (MSF),
the seawater is heated to a maximum temperature of about
115 °C and then passes through a series of pressure stages. In
each chamber a lower pressure than in the previous one prevails,
so that part of the salty seawater is spontaneously flashed to
steam in order to reach the local saturation state. The multiple-
In each
effect distillation (MED) consists of multiple stages.
stage, the seawater flows on horizontal pipes in the direction of
gravity, forming seawater films on the surface of pipes. The hori-
zontal pipes are internally heated by a steam flow. Accordingly,
part of the seawater is vaporized, collected and directed into the
horizontal pipes of the next stage. There, the vapour condenses;
releasing its condensation heat to another seawater film and the
process is repeated. For large applications, multi-effect distilla-
tion is often used together with vapour compression in order to
recover low temperature heat, resulting in an efficiency increase
of the MED process. The thermal desalination processes (based
on enthalpy of evaporation) are, in contrast to membrane pro-
cesses, an energy-intensive. However, the membranes are sensi-
tive to chlorine or organic components, so that an additional
pre-treatment of the seawater is essential.

PThe thermal desalination processes require heating steam that is,
generally, produced by a combined heat and power plant or a
nuclear reactor. The thermal desalinations are operated at their
nominal base loads (stable regimes) and therefore steady state simu-
lation models are adequate. However, a few studies on the dynamic
simulations of desalination plants can be found in the literature. For
example, Agha et al. [37] developed the dynamic simulation model
of a thermal desalination process (MSF-TVC) using APROS. The
model was evaluated towards the design data of an industrial desali-
nation plant in Tripoli-Libya with 1200 m3/day production capacity.
Furthermore, detailed models of thermal desalination units (MED
and MSF) coupled with nuclear reactors are presented. Al-Fulaij et
al. [99,100] developed lumped parameter dynamic models for once-
through MSF and brine circulation MSF using gPROMS. The gener-
ated models were in good agreement with measurement data
obtained from existing MSF plants with relative error below 1.5% in
steady state and dynamic conditions. Among others, further publica-
tions on the dynamic simulation of desalination plants are
[126,142,318(cid:1)324]. Recently, new technologies are developed to
desalinate seawater using renewable energy sources [325], espe-
cially solar energy [326] or even municipal solid waste [327]. These
intermittent energy sources (e.g. cloudy day in case of solar energy
and variation in heating value of municipal solid waste) require an
understanding of the transient process behaviour, which in turn can
be evaluated using dynamic simulation.

8. Conclusion and future prospects

POperating flexibility of thermal power plants is essential in order
to compensate the intermittency of renewable energy sources such
as wind or photovoltaics. Enhanced flexibility requirements for
power plants translate, among others, into high load gradients,
reducing the minimum load limit and minimising start-up duration.
This study is a review of dynamic simulation for design, optimisation
and the development of novel thermal power plants, including
hybrid concepts that integrate renewables in conventional power
plants.

PAn overview of dynamic simulation programmes widely used for
scientific and industrial application is presented, supported by
example models for different simulation codes such as ASPEN PLUS
DYNAMICS, DYMOLA and APROS. The simulation codes are generally
based on the governing conservation equations of mass, momentum,
species and energy. The specific mathematical formulation of the
balance equations depends on the underlying flow model. Many
approaches can be found in the literature such as mixture flow
model or two-fluid models, which in turn can be divided into four-
equation, five-equation, six-equation and seven-equation flow mod-
els. Due to its relative simplicity and suitability for a range of practi-
cal applications, the mixture flow model is of considerable relevance
since the calculation of average mixture properties is often suffi-
ciently accurate for system-level analysis. The two-fluid model offers
the possibility to consider thermodynamic non-equilibrium phe-
nomena. It is thus more suitable for detailed analysis of specific com-
ponents and application cases characterised by intense mass and
heat transfer between phases. The resulting partial differential equa-
tion system is discretised and typically closed with empirical corre-
lations, which are selected according to the prevailing flow regime.
Basic process components required for modelling thermal power
plants such as tubes, flow valves, heat exchangers, turbomachines
etc. are discussed, complemented by automation and electrical mod-
ules vital for power plant control. The latter include analogue and
binary modules, signal sources, controllers, generator, transformer,
inverter and others.

PRelevant publications on dynamic simulation are discussed for
the different technologies of combined-cycle power, coal-fired
power, nuclear power, concentrated solar power, geothermal power,
municipal waste incineration and thermal desalination in the indi-
vidual chapters. The results can be summarised as follows:

PCombined-cycle power: Since the gas turbine is an inherently flexi-
ble component, studies in the literature are largely focused on the
dynamic response of the water/steam bottoming cycle, in particular
the heat recovery steam generator. Detailed modelling and calcula-
tion of CCPP start-up transients are conducted rather frequently, as
well as dynamic optimisation under thermal stress restraints. In con-
trast, system-level dynamics of the IGCC process and the interaction
of syngas path components are not well understood and should be
the subject of further study. By deriving reduced models for real-
time computation from the detailed simulation models, the prospec-
tive use of model-predictive control in power engineering applica-
tions can be envisaged. Some recent studies are dedicated to shift
the field of dynamic simulation and optimisation away from com-
mercial codes towards more openly accessible models and software
tools, a promising approach that the authors would encourage other
researchers to follow in the interest of scientific progress.

PPulverised coal power: In many countries, coal-fired power genera-
tion remains indispensable in the foreseeable future in order to cover
base load demand. While all coal-fired power plants have the same
working principle, each power plant is unique engineered, leading to
individual dynamic behaviour. Here, the load change and start-up
behaviour by increasing flexibility requirements are in the focus of

Pinterest. The lack of available data for validation of the developed
models is a major problem. Although the technology of coal-fired
power is well known, there is still potential for further improvement
regarding load gradients, minimal load limit and start-up procedure,
which can be explored using dynamic simulation. Furthermore, the
combustion of coal with a nitrogen-free oxidant (oxyfuel concept)
has recently received attention. Dynamic simulation can contribute
to this field of research, since design and operation experiences from
conventional coal power plants can only be applied to a limited
degree.

PNuclear power: The topic of dynamic simulation for nuclear power
plants is broadly discussed and thorough work has already been
done, in the field of accident analyses in particular. The amount of
research on NPP load-following capability is limited but not a likely
focus for further study due to both economic and technical reasons.
The statistical analysis of transient system behaviour is an approach
only used for NPPs as yet. The existing body of literature shows that
the classic approach of selecting conservative boundary conditions
has its downsides for complex systems. Therefore, statistical analysis
should be considered as option for other applications where operat-
ing safety is paramount..

PConcentrated solar power: Due to the inherently dynamic nature of
CSP operation, a significant number of studies are available in the lit-
erature. Most studies focus on system-level plant dynamics consid-
ering transient solar radiation. Some other studies investigate the
dynamic behaviour of sub-systems such as thermal energy storage,
considering stable power output and improvement of capacity fac-
tor. In case of molten salt as heat transfer fluid, detailed analyses of
filling and draining procedures are conducted. Optimised operation
strategies are frequently reported. The considered time horizons
vary from operating transients of several minutes up to the predic-
tion of annual performance data. A certain emphasis lies on mathe-
matical models for the solar field. Most studies use a simplified
steady state model rather than a detailed dynamic model of the
power block. Thus, more attention should be dedicated to detailed
modelling of the whole plant in order to analyse the dynamic inter-
action of sub-systems (solar field, thermal energy storage, power
block) with higher accuracy.

PGeothermal power: In this technology, the heat released from the
earth's crust is removed to drive a Rankine cycle. The literature
research shows that only few works were conducted to understand
the dynamic behaviour of geothermal power plants. There are, how-
ever, several numerical studies on the dynamic storage behaviour of
the geothermal heat reservoirs. The need for more dynamic simula-
tion regarding the used processes will most likely be small. Still, the
advantages for process optimisation and for testing new control
structures can be relevant for the power plants that usually run at
nominal load.

PMunicipal waste incineration: In many industrialized countries,
municipal waste incinerations are the preferred choice for the large-
scale disposal of municipal solid waste. The variation of waste heat-
ing value has a considerable influence on the water/steam circuit
and accordingly on the plant operation and efficiency. There are no
studies in the literature on dynamic simulation of a municipal waste
incarnation plant hitherto. For the first time, selected calculation
results are presented in this review. Additional dynamic studies
have to be provided to the scientific literature, with particular atten-
tion to validation at the real plant.

PThermal desalination: In order to expand the available water resour-
ces in arid countries, large-scale seawater desalination is a mature,
but energy-intensive technology. In the literature, there are only few

Pstudies regarding the dynamic behaviour of thermal desalination
plants (e.g. MSF and MED). The absence of detailed analysis of desali-
nation process dynamics, in addition to the missing validation with
plant data should be covered with future studies. Furthermore, there
is an interest in developing new desalination technologies using
renewable energy sources, which increases the need for dynamic
simulation.

PThe desirable expansion of renewable energy sources in many
countries around the world is drastically altering the traditional
landscape of power generation, which is required to ensure security
of supply. Intermittent energy sources such as wind and solar lead to
increasing market demand for control energy in order to maintain
grid stability. However, this does not compensate for the decline in
wholesale electricity prices that impairs the economic viability of
thermal power plants. A number of measures are introduced by
power plant operators in response to the new market environment
such as retrofitting existing power plants for higher load gradients
and reduced minimum load. Thus, the accurate prediction of
dynamic system behaviour becomes an integral part of design and
operation of thermal power plants. Furthermore, process optimisa-
tion, which is not always feasible in the real plant due to economic
and safety reasons, is numerically possible. Dynamic simulation is a
valuable tool for both the researcher and the practitioner in order to
gain valuable insight and understanding of the system.

PIn closing: “Static is simple, but the universe is dynamic”.
