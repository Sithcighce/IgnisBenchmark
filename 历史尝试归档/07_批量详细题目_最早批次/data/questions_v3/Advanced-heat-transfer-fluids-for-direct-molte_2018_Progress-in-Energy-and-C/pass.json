Provide a detailed analysis of how different cations (Na, K, Ca, Li) influence the degradation pathways.",
    "standard_answer": "The thermal stability of nitrate salts is primarily governed by the equilibrium reaction NO3- ↔ NO2- + 1/2O2 (Eq. 4). At higher temperatures (>400°C), secondary decomposition occurs via Eqs. 6-7, producing oxide species (O2-) and nitrogen oxides. The stability is inversely correlated with cation charge density - higher charge density cations (Ca2+, Li+) polarize the nitrate electron cloud, weakening N-O bonds. Ca-containing salts show lower stability due to carbonate formation via CO2 + O2- → CO32- (Eq. 8). Li promotes oxide formation which increases corrosion. Na/K systems are most stable due to lower polarization effects. The maximum operating temperature is determined by the onset of irreversible decomposition (typically 3% mass loss in TGA), with Solar Salt stable to 560°C while Ca-containing HitecXL is limited to 500°C due to accelerated decomposition pathways.",
