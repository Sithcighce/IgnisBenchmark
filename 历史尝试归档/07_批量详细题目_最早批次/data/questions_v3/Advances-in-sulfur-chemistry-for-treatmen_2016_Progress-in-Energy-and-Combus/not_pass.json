    "question_text": "Explain the chemiluminescence phenomena observed in H2S combustion flames and how spectral analysis can be used to identify key intermediate species. What are the characteristic emission bands for SO*, SO2*, and HS radicals?",
    "standard_answer": "Chemiluminescence in H2S flames arises from excited electronic states of intermediate species formed during combustion. When these excited states (denoted by *) relax to ground state, they emit characteristic photons. Key emission bands identified by Selim et al. (2011) include: 1) SO* emission between 320-350 nm (A³Π → X³Σ transition), 2) SO2* continuum emission beyond 350 nm, and 3) HS absorption bands at 324.03 and 328.62 nm (A²Σ → X²Π transition). The inner cone of H2S-doped H2/air flames shows intense SO*/SO2* emission due to high radical concentrations in the primary reaction zone. Spectroscopic analysis reveals SO forms early in the flame through H2S + O → HS + OH followed by HS + O → SO + H. SO2 forms later via SO + O2 → SO2 + O. The relative intensities of these bands correlate with equivalence ratio - fuel-rich conditions enhance SO* while lean conditions promote SO2*. Quantitative laser-induced fluorescence measurements by Muller et al. (1979) confirmed these spectral assignments.",
    "original_text": {
      "1": "The inner cone showed a strong group of peaks between 320 and 470 nm. These peaks were grouped into the SO* band within 320–350 nm, SO3* and H* bands beyond 350 nm and HS absorption bands at 324.03 and 328.62 nm.",
      "2": "Muller et al. [90] measured concentrations of HS, S2, SO, SO2, and OH radicals using quantitative laser fluorescence."
