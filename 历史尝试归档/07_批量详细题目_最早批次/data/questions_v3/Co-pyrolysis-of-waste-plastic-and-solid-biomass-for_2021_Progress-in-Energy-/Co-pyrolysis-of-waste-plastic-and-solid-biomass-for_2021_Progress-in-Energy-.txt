The amount of plastics disposed from modern lifestyles have increased sharply in recent years. Solid
biomass is an abundant energy resource that exists worldwide. Transformation of these waste plastics
and solid biomass feedstock mixtures via co-pyrolysis can provide synergistic product enhancement for
fuels and value-added products. The produced products can be used as chemicals and pollutant sorbents
to foster eco-friendly pathways for waste management and sustainability. Progress into this avenue of
waste disposal and energy production is the focus of this review. Properties of characteristic solid feed-
stock mixtures are discussed with focus on elemental composition, proximate analysis, and heating value.
Effective H to C ratio of the different feedstocks is evaluated for asserting the quality of petrochemi-
cal equivalent products produced from co-pyrolysis of plastic wastes and biomass. The characteristics of
polyethylene terephthalate (PET), high density and low-density polyethylene (HDPE & LDPE), polyvinyl
chloride (PVC), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS) and other major plastic waste components are dis-
cussed with focus on synergistic effects attainable by co-pyrolyzing them with biomass. State-of-the-art
experimental methods for co-pyrolysis investigation are reviewed in detail using TGA, pyrolyzer, fixed
bed reactor, fluidized bed reactor, microwave, and multi-step reactors using GC, MS, and FTIR diagnos-
tics. In addition, different catalytic co-pyrolysis reactors are compared and discussed at different ratios
of feedstock to catalyst, reactor temperature, and other operational parameters along with an in-depth
understanding of several catalytic processing (ZSM-5 based catalyst, transition metal-based catalyst, mul-
tipurpose catalysts and ex-situ catalyst) for favorable products yield. Co-pyrolysis of waste plastic and
solid biomass mixtures are reviewed for insights into liquid products for fuels and chemicals, as well as
yield and composition of gases and solid residues evolved along with surface characteristics of the solid
residues obtained from the selected configurations. The challenges and opportunities envisioned for the
development in co-pyrolysis of several solid organic waste and plastic feedstock mixtures are also dis-
cussed. The goal was to provide favorable feasible pathways for clean and efficient disposal of plastic
wastes with the incorporation of waste biomass for enhanced synergistic effects in waste disposal along
with the recovery of energy and value-added products.

1. Introduction

Solid  waste  management  is  one  of  most  important  global  is-
sues facing the society worldwide due to its relatively slow pace
of  technological  development.  The  practice  of  landfills  is  unsus-
tainable and expensive in terms of environmental costs with the
evolution odors and by-products that are hazardous to the envi-
ronment and impacts human health [1] . Increased use of solid or-
ganic wastes can provide valuable negative cost resources that are
under-utilized and which can be converted to energy to help sup-
port issues on energy needs as well as waste disposal and waste
management [2] . Combination of environment, resources and en-
ergy could be a nexus for research to achieve environment protec-
tion, waste management and energy production.

Ease in processing, low cost, light weight, durability, and chem-
ical  and  environmental  corrosion  resistance  provided  by  plastics
have  led  to  their  rapid  growth  over  the  past  50  years  to  make

them a ubiquitous component in a wide range of commodities in-
cluding production of consumer goods [3] . However, low degrad-
ability of the plastics causes serious environmental problems and
a big challenge in waste management [4] . According to the United
States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), while 35.4 million
tons  of  plastic  wastes  were  generated  in  2017  in  the  USA,  only
75.8% of this amount were landfilled. The amounts generated and
landfilled in 2015 were also similar [ 5 , 6 ]. Amounts of plastic waste
generation  and  disposal  in  various  regions  of  the  global,  includ-
ing the USA, as well as their estimated growth from 1950 to 2050
are shown in Fig. 1 (a) [7] . In 2018, plastics production reached 359
million tons globally ( Fig. 1 (b)), out of which China contributed to
30% of the world’s plastics production, and Europe’s plastics pro-
duction reached almost 62 million tons (contributing to 17%) [8] .
It is estimated that with the current rate of waste management
the plastic generation will result in approximately 12 billion metric
tons of waste disposal into landfills or into some other natural re-

sources by 2050 [7] . Improper disposal of waste plastics including
landfilling can lead to their structural disintegration with time into
smaller  particles  of  different  sizes  that  includes  macro-plastics,
meso-plastics, micro-plastics, and nano-plastics. Micro-plastics are
small plastic particles less than five millimeters [9] , which can con-
vey as pollutants via water and fodder into food to affect human
health and the ecosystems by entering into food chain in addition
to deteriorating agricultural soils [10–12] . Oceanic plastic pollution
is also a growing problem worldwide to cause environmental con-
cern and endangering numerous marine species [13] .

Although the above reasonings make landfilling unattractive, in-
cineration is widely accepted because it can permanently decom-
pose plastic waste that also offers high volumetric reduction and
thermal energy recovery that can subsequently be used for conver-
sion to electrical energy. Incineration also provides carbon manage-
ment in the regular energy production sector by displacing other
fuels used for production [ 14 , 15 ]. Significant number of incinera-
tion plants use plastic wastes that were developed in Europe [15] .
However, incineration of these wastes causes release of toxic pol-
lutants  such  as  phosgene,  dioxins,  polycyclic  aromatic  hydrocar-
bons, polychlorinated biphenyls, heavy metals, toxic free radicals,
and dust that are hazardous to the ecosystem as well as risks of
carcinogenic, mutagenic, and neurological complications to humans
[ 16 , 17 ]. Emission of  airborne pollutants can cause  contamination
near to the vicinity of the combustion unit, thereby affecting ad-
jacent  communities  with  unpleasant  odors  and  toxic  compound
emissions, which can cause adverse effects to health, property and
building aesthetics [18] . The incineration requires extensive flue-
gas cleaning, which leads to significant increase in costs, reduced
process efficiency and thus unsustainable operation, especially in
terms of energy recovery and environmental impact.

To avoid the resource wastage and environment pollution, many
strategies have been proposed to utilize the waste plastics, espe-
cially for energy and fuels production. A better pathway to resolve
these issues is by thermal decomposition with controlled oxida-
tion due to benefits on lower pollutant’s emission, provide prod-
uct  uniformity,  high  throughput,  scalability,  efficiency,  and  feed-
stock versatility as compared to other processes such as, anaero-
bic digestion and other chemical and biochemical conversion tech-
niques  [ 19 , 20 ].  Thermochemical  disposal  techniques  such  as  py-
rolysis  and  gasification  can  provide  efficient  and  versatile  recov-
ery for fuels and value-added chemicals from the plastic wastes
with better throughput as compared to biochemical processes [2] .
The  various  types  of  solid  waste  provide  not  only  unique  chal-
lenges for energy utilization, but also the fuels and energy yield
from  gasification  or  pyrolysis  as  they  are  strongly  influenced  by

the mixed feedstock composition and fraction [ 21 , 22 ]. Pyrolysis is
the thermal decomposition of organic substances in the absence of
oxygen to form liquids (condensable), solids, and non-condensable
gases  [ 23 , 24 ].  Fast  pyrolysis  at  moderate  temperatures  and  very
short reaction times has gained considerable interest in the recent
decades  for  its  capability  to  selectively  produce  bio-oil  products
[25] . The pyrolysis of pure plastics can provide pyrolysis oil and
syngas with improved hydrogen content and calorific value along
with lowered oxygen content to result in improved oil properties.
These processes are prone to scalability issues in terms of clog-
ging the feedlines due to high viscosity of melted or softened plas-
tics in addition to the problem of inhibited fluidization [25] . Cok-
ing was also observed in these reactors, which led to downstream
blockages and decreased products yield and quality, and increased
operational difficulties. Furthermore, acquiring and separating out
the waste plastics into pure components is difficult due to lack of
proper infrastructure for waste separation with the current large
dependency on manual separation. This leads to plastics wastes of-
ten supplied as part of municipal solid wastes that are contami-
nated or mixed with other plastic or bio-wastes. So, understanding
the behavior and development of co-pyrolysis processes is essen-
tial as it not only relaxes the need for waste separation but also
offers some promise of eliminating operational issues in pure plas-
tic waste conversion [26] .

Biomass  and  biowastes  are  formed  via  photosynthetic  routes
using extracted solar energy to sequester CO
2 O in the form
of  carbonaceous  solids.  Due  to  relatively  fast  production  rate  of
biomass and its carbonaceous nature, it is considered carbon neu-
tral when converted to versatile products [27] . The products from
biomass can range from energy precursors (such as syngas, liquid
bioethanol, liquid biodiesel, solid briquette, gaseous methane, and
biodegradable  plastics)  to  biochemical  products,  which  are  simi-
lar to the counterpart fossil-fuel incumbents [28] . Bioenergy is the
only form of renewable energy that can be collected, stored, and
transported,  and  this  form  of  renewable  energy  is  most  similar
to  conventional  fossil  fuel  energy  sources  [ 29 , 30 ].  Therefore,  the
bioenergy is dispatachable energy and can be used when desired.
Fig.  2  shows  special  characteristics  and  products  of  biomass  en-
ergy in a renewable energy system. Biomass resources broadly in-
cludes various sources, such as wood or forest residues (e.g., tree
branches,  leaves,  shrubberies,  grass),  agricultural  grain  residues
(e.g.,  straw,  stalk,  corn  cob),  energy  corps  (e.g.  jatropha  curcas
seed, switchgrass, algae), food production or industry residues and
byproducts (e.g., coffee nut shell, other nut shell), animal farming
(e.g., manure that is rich in nitrogen and phosphorus, animal fat),
human waste from sewage plants and municipal plants [31] . Solid

biomass accounted for the largest share of biomass utilization in
the form of heat and electricity [32] . In 2017, industrial heat en-
ergy consumption from solid biomass was approximately 898 PJ in
the European Union with dominant contributions in pulp, paper
and printing, as well as in the wood and wood products industries,
which accounted for some 85% of the biomass energy consumption
in the industrial sector [33] . Solid biomass for energy utilization
can be obtained from different kinds of organic residues including
forestry residues, agricultural residues, energy plants or crops, in-
dustrial organic wastes or residues, and municipal solid wastes. It
is mostly used directly in the form produced by the industry (e.g.,
sawdust, forestry and agricultural chips), but sometimes upgraded
in the form of solid biofuels (e.g., briquette fuel, block shaped fuel,
densified pellet fuel, biochar, torrified biomass) [33] .

Co-pyrolysis  of  waste  plastic  and  solid  biomass  led  to  syner-
gistic  effects,  which  could  improve  products  quality  [34] .  Plastic
wastes contain high hydrogen to carbon (H/C) ratio and relatively
low oxygen to carbon (O/C) ratio which can support solid biomass’s
inherently high O/C and low H/C during co-pyrolysis to result in
increased quality and uniformity of the products while minimiz-
ing coke deposition exhibited by pyrolysis of pure plastic wastes
[35] . Co-pyrolysis offers an attractive pathway with high potential
for mixed wastes by minimizing the requirements on waste sepa-
ration [36] .

Co-pyrolysis studies on waste plastic and solid biomass in the
recent  years  include  fundamental  as  well  as  review  papers  for
studies on various reaction conditions, reactors and product yield
optimization with focus on variations in kinetics [37] , thermal be-
havior [38] , synergistic effect in products [39–41] . Activation en-
ergies required in co-pyrolysis of mixture was lower than that of
waste plastic but higher than that of solid biomass [37] . Energy
usage for co-pyrolysis of different mixtures (1.43–1.84 MJ/kg) were
higher than solid biomass (1.29 MJ/kg) but lower than waste plas-
tic (2.07 MJ/kg) [38] . Production of oil increased while the char de-
creased [39] . Increase in char amounts was also possible depending
on the co-pyrolysis conditions [ 40 , 41 ]. Abnisa et al., Hassan et al.
and Zhang et al. reviewed and summarized the research progress
in  non-catalytic  and  catalytic  co-pyrolysis  and  their  benefits  on
quality enhancement of pyrolysis oil derived from biomass mixed
with waste plastics, waste tires and coal materials during pyrolysis
to produce improved liquid fuel yields [42–44] . These studies re-
vealed that co-pyrolysis of waste plastic and solid biomass can sig-
nificantly improve the yield and quality of pyrolysis oil [42] while

catalytic co-pyrolysis of waste plastic and biomass can provide su-
perior  performance  in  upgrading  pyrolysis  oil  [43] .  Catalytic  co-
pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass with waste plastic to produce
aromatics can be a more promising technique than the catalytic
pyrolysis  alone  of  lignocellulosic  biomass  [44] .  Wong  et  al.  re-
viewed technical aspects of converting plastic wastes into fuel us-
ing thermal, microwave and catalytic pyrolysis, and fluid catalytic
cracking, as well as liquids from co-pyrolysis of plastic wastes with
biomass [3] . Uzoejinwa et al. discussed the advantages of the co-
pyrolysis  process  in  terms  of  yield,  mechanism  and  operational
control  and  found  them  to  be  promising  compared  to  biomass
pyrolysis  alone  [45] .  Block  et  al.  reviewed  literature  on  the  co-
pyrogasification  of  plastics  and  biomass  from  the  perspective  of
process pathway, reactors, feedstock characteristics and operating
conditions on the products distribution, along with synergetic ef-
fects between plastics and biomass mixtures [26] . But to be the
best of our knowledge, updated and comprehensive review of co-
pyrolysis of several different varieties of plastics mixed with solid
biomass at different scales of reactors as well as the distribution of
evolved products is still lacking. This work provides a broader re-
view of the state-of-the-art advances in co-pyrolysis of mixtures of
waste plastic and solid biomass feedstocks starting with the per-
spective of physical and chemical properties of waste plastic and
solid biomass. This is then followed by the influence of different
plastic wastes, reactors and operational conditions on the phase-
distribution and composition of products. Added discussion is then
made  regarding  the  state-of-the  art  in  catalysts  utilized  for  co-
pyrolysis. A flow chart summary of the topics discussed in this pa-
per is shown in Fig. 3 . With the broad perspective obtained from
this literature review, a discussion on the challenges and opportu-
nities are sumarized in conclusions. The results reveal the impor-
tance of co-pyrolysis research and provide pathways for the future
research needed to support sustainable and synergistic waste dis-
posal.

2. Physical and chemical properties of feedstock

2.1. Waste plastic

Plastic  wastes  contain  different  types  of  polymers  such
as,  polyethylene  terephthalate  (PET),  high  density  and  low-
density  polyethylene  (HDPE  and  LDPE),  polyvinyl  chloride  (PVC),
polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), polycarbonate (PC), Polyacryl

(PA)  and  others.  Although  each  of  these  plastics  have  different
chemical structure with different amounts of carbon, oxygen and
hydrogen  content,  their  common  feature  includes  relatively  high
volatile content, viscosity and heating value, but very low moisture
and ash content [46] . These are summarized in Table 1 on the ba-
sis of code order number (as 1, 2, 3, ...) for PET, HDPE, PVC, LDPE,
PP, PS, PC and others, respectively [ 47 , 48 ].

Hydrogen/carbon ratio (H/C

eff) is an important factor for their
potential to fuels and value-added products. This factor shows po-
tential ability of the feedstock for conversion to hydrocarbons eco-
nomically, and also assists to estimate the overall yield of olefin
and aromatics, coke yield, and the catalyst deactivation rate [54] .

Chen et al. [55] used H / C
content  of  different  feedstocks.  The  H/C
eff ratio  is  based  on  the
assumption that all the heteroatoms are completely converted to

where H, O, N, S and C are the mole percentages or number of
moles  of  hydrogen,  oxygen,  nitrogen,  sulfur,  and  carbon  in  the
feedstock, respectively.

Addition of antioxidants, ultraviolet (UV) stabilizers, plasticizers,
thermal  stabilizers,  lubricants,  photo-initiators,  antistatic  agents,
and others is carried out during plastic manufacturing to improve
and preserve the polymer properties. This can lead to variation be-
tween the theoretical pure plastic composition and industrial el-
ement analysis as these additives are not known and their addi-
tion changes the net composition of the feedstock by 0.02 to 0.5%
[ 57 , 58 ]. The actual elemental and proximate analysis, and LHV of
some characteristic plastic materials are listed in Table 2 . During
pyrolysis or gasification, plastic can act as a hydrocarbon pool in
2  and
co-pyrolysis with biomass to generate large quantities of H
H + during pyrolysis. The amounts of C and H, and the H/C ratio of
the feedstock and the oil can significantly correlate to the heating
value of pyrolysis oil produced. The availability of hydrogen dur-
ing co-pyrolysis process provides improved quality of pyrolysis oil
from biomass-plastic mixtures [ 59 , 60 ].

2.2. Solid biomass

Solid biomass covers a wide range of materials including woods,
straws,  agricultural  residues,  processing  wastes,  algae  and  sea-
weeds [94] . Solid biomass can also be attained from livestock ma-
nure,  municipal  organic  solid  waste;  the  latter  being  a  suitable
feedstock material for pyrolysis. The elemental, proximate analysis
and LHV of characteristic solid organic biomass material suitable
for co-pyrolysis are showed in Table 3 .

Compared  to  waste  plastics,  solid  organic  biomass  shown  in
Table  3  has  lower  amounts  of  volatiles,  hydrogen,  and  calorific
content  but  higher  ash  and  oxygen  content.  Lower  H / C
eff ratio
feedstocks  tend  to  produce  more  coke  which  is  not  only  harm-
ful  to  the  environment  but  also  hampers  the  production  of  oil
in  the  pyrolysis  process  [54] .  Pyrolysis-gas  chromatography/mass
spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) studies with noble metal-based catalysts
(W
eff ra-
tio of the mixture > 1.0 resulted in high relative aromatic hydro-
carbons yields [59] . Co-pyrolysis of solid biomass with plastics can
improve the H/C
eff ratio to effectively upgrade the quality of pyrol-
ysis oil produced.

Lignocellulosic  biomass  is  one  of  the  most  abundant  type  of
biomass  resources  on  the  earth  from  sources  such  as  forestry
and agricultural residues with more than 100 billion metric tons
produced  every  year  [111] .  From  this  amount  only  about  3.7–
5.1  billion  metric  tons  (approximately)  of  agricultural  residue  is
disposed-off annually [112–114] . The potential of current forestry
waste to bioenergy is estimated to be in the range of 0.8 to 10.6
EJ per year by 2050 [115] . Effective utilization of forestry wastes
has become a practical option, particularly in the European Union
countries,  where  the  energy  derived  from  forestry  biomass  ac-
counts  for  more  than  half  of  the  renewable  energy  [115] .  Fig.  4
illustrates that cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin as the three ma-
jor components that are unevenly distributed in the cell wall as
skeleton, linking material and hard solids while a small amount of
extractives and ash could also be present [116] . Cellulose is a lin-

200. Hemicelluloses are branched, amorphous and random hetero-
geneous polysaccharides of pentoses (xylose and arabinose), hex-
oses  (mannose,  glucose,  galactose  and  rhamnose)  and  acetylated
sugars [117] . Lignin is a mononuclear aromatic polymer with high
degree  of  branching  and  substitution.  It  is  often  found  as  a  lig-
nocellulosic  complex  and  often  bound  to  adjacent  cellulose  and
hemicellulose fibers [118] . Thermal analysis of these materials re-
vealed that pyrolysis of hemicellulose and cellulose occurs at 220–
315 °C and 315–400 °C, respectively. However, lignin is more ther-
mally resilient, leading to its weight loss over a wide range of tem-
peratures from 160 to 900 °C [119] .

2.3. Calculation of synergistic effect

Synergistic  effect  can  be  defined  as  binary,  ternary  or  multi-
ple mixtures of biomass and plastic to produce an effect higher or
lower than that calculated or determined from weighted value of
the individual feedstock during co-pyrolysis. Change in blend ratio
of feedstock is one of the most important factors that influences
the synergistic effects [ 43 , 45 , 85 ].

To determine the existence of a synergistic effect in co-pyrolysis
of plastic and biomass mixtures, the indexes obtained from exper-
imental and calculated value can be compared. Theoretical value

can be calculated from the proportional weighted average values
measured from the individual pyrolysis [105] . Thus, a positive syn-
ergistic effect ( (cid:3) Y ) during co-pyrolysis occurs if the experimental
value is higher than the weighted aggregate calculated value [69] .

3. Different waste plastic in co-pyrolysis

3.1. PET and solid biomass

Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) is one of the most important
commercial polyester that accounts for approximately 7-9% of the
global plastic consumption [ 120 , 121 ]. PET contains similar oxygen
content as other majority of the solid biomass with similar H/C
eff
but  PET  is  non-biodegradable.  Although  some  PET  wastes  were
recycled  to  produce  engineering  resins  [122] ,  PET  wastes  were
often  found  with  other  waste  plastics  that  lowers  their  recycla-
bility  rate  to  less  than  10%  in  the  USA  [ 67 , 122 ].  Co-pyrolysis  of
solid wastes and PET with several solid biomass such as, paulow-
nia  wood  [ 49 , 67 ],  cotton  stalk,  hazelnut  shell,  sunflower  residue
[ 37 , 123 ],  municipal  solid  wastes  [65] ,  nut  shells  [ 124 , 125 ],  and
samanea saman seeds [126] were investigated. The findings from
these studies are briefly discussed below.

Chen et al. studied fast co-pyrolysis of PET and paulownia wood
and  reported  synergistic  effects  in  both  thermal  behavior  using
TGA [49] , and gases yield using fixed bed reactor [67] . The results
showed deviation between the experimental values on the volatiles
released from the overall process and the calculated value obtained
from  the  weighted  aggregate.  Synergistic  increase  in  char  yields
from  co-pyrolysis  of  the  blends  was  observed.  In  addition,  char
yield increased with increase in PET blend ratio. The PET degra-
dation could act as controlling factor for the cross-linking reaction.
With increase in PET blend ratio, more products derived from PET
could cross-link with the char from paulownia wood resulting in
more char yield during co-pyrolysis [49] . Synergistic effects were
apparent in fast co-pyrolysis (fixed bed reactor) leading to lowered
4 release from fast co-
gas yield but increased char and oil yield. CH
pyrolysis of the blends decreased significantly as the PET amounts
in the mixture increased. However, C
2 composition increased and
reached maximum until 80 wt.% PET ratio and then decreased [67] .
Çepelio  ̆gullar et al. [123] examined slow pyrolysis for mixtures
of PET and solid biomass (cotton stalk, hazelnut shells, sunflower
residues and Euphorbia rigida) in a fixed-bed reactor and reported
the results obtained on the yields of liquid, char and gas. PET-solid
biomass blends resulted in increased pyrolysis oil and char but de-
creased gas when compared to the aggregate yields from individ-
ual component pyrolysis. Almost 50% of PET was decomposed into
benzoic acid when it was pyrolyzed alone while the pyrolysis oil
from co-pyrolysis of mixture dominated the presence of both acids
and esters. However, co-pyrolysis of PET and biomass with catalyst
enhanced decarboxylation of benzoic acid and formed aromatic hy-
drocarbons [127] . Benzoic acid was formed along with vinyl ben-

9

zoate because of beta scission at the carboxylic group wherein the
ester link was broken when PET was pyrolyzed at 395 °C [128] .
Çepelio  ̆gullar et al. [37] also investigated thermal behaviors of four
biomass and PET mixtures in a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA).
According to analysis of weight loss as a function oftemperature
of  these  mixtures,  the  temperatures  corresponding  to  the  maxi-
mum weight loss for the thermal decomposition of biomass–PET
mixtures  were  higher  than  the  individual  material.  This  was  at-
tributed to complex nature of PET polymer which decomposes in
two stages.

Ko et al. studied co-pyrolysis of PET blended with macadamia
nut  shells  using  a  large-scale  customized  TGA  and  13 C  and
1 H  solid-state  nuclear  magnetic  resonance  (NMR)  spectroscopy
[ 124 , 125 ]. The presence of aliphatic signals in the 13 C NMR indi-
cated that the char from macadamia nutshell can capture volatiles
from the PET, thereby enabling them to form char like structures.
The differential thermogravimetry (DTG) and 13 C solid-state NMR
results indicated the synergistic effect on improved carbon yield in
the co-pyrolysis products [124] . PET-biomass interaction stabilized
the radicals in the char thereby increasing the radical concentra-
tion and PET degradation at lower temperatures. Co-pyrolysis in-
creased the yield of char at reduced temperatures which was due
to enhanced PET degradation in blends as compared to solo PET.
The radical concentration in the char in the PET degradation rate
could be controlled by temperature and blending ratio. At 400 °C
in the presence of biomass, crystallites formation in PET was com-
pletely suppressed and the formation and growth of polycyclic aro-
matic hydrocarbons (PAHs) increased [125] . As an aromatic poly-
mer, PET is more selective in formation of polyaromatic (such as,
naphthalenes)  products  with  biomass  in  co-pyrolysis  [129] .  Aro-
matic  hydrocarbon  could  be  produced  via  a  combination  of  hy-
drocarbon  pool  pathway  and  Diel-Alder  reactions  from  the  co-
pyrolysis of PET and solid biomass (see Fig. 5 ) [130] .

Ansah et al. [65] studied co-pyrolysis of municipal solid waste
(MSW) components including wood, paper, and PET. Their results
showed  that  PET  plastic  pyrolysis  occurred  between  360–480  °C
(which is higher than 220–380 °C for biomass). Significant inter-
action between biomass and PET during co-pyrolysis was observed
when the biomass fraction was dominant in the mixture (biomass
and PET blend at 70:30 resulted in higher synergistic effect than
50:50 or 30:70 blend). This result is similar to the study by Mishra
et al. [126] who showed that biomass and PET blend at 3:1 re-
sulted in higher synergistic effect than those obtained for blend
ratios of 1:1 or 5:1. Energy required for the co-pyrolysis of biomass
and PET mixture increased with increase in plastic content in the
mixture since the pyrolysis of PET plastic consumes more energy
than  wood.  Torrefaction  of  MSW  boosted  the  mixing  and  inter-
action  between  wood  and  PET.  However,  torrefaction  (at  280  °C
for 30 min) increased the amount of energy required during co-
pyrolysis by approximately four times compared to co-pyrolysis of
raw wood and PET mixture (at blend ratio of 1:1) without torrefac-
tion  [65] .  Further  research  studies  are  needed  to  investigate  the
influence of torrefaction on co-pyrolysis from the point of view of
systemic energy recovery.

3.2. HDPE and solid biomass

High density polyethylene (HDPE) is one of the cheapest ther-
moplastic and fourth-largest commodity plastic material that ac-
counts  for  about  15%  of  the  global  plastic  consumption  after
polypropylene, low density polyethylene and polyvinyl chloride in
terms of volume [ 120 , 131 ]. HDPE features high strength-to-density
ratio, due to higher density and lower branching, which gives it
stronger intermolecular forces and tensile strength than low den-
sity polyethylene.

Hassan et al. investigated co-pyrolysis of sugarcane bagasse and
HDPE  for  synergistic  effect  in  the  product  distributions  [132]  as
well  as  increase  in  liquid  yield  and  quality  [101]  from  a  fixed-
bed  reactor  over  temperatures  of  40 0–70 0  °C.  The  results  re-
vealed  liquid  yield  improvement  (of  about  61wt.%)  compared  to
the  weighted  aggregate  value  (of  about  55  wt.%).  Strongest  syn-
ergistic  effect  was  observed  at  600  °C  using  60:40  mixture  ra-
tio of HDPE: sugarcane bagasse, with the maximum difference be-
ing 6 wt.%. This is because hydroxyl intermediates from sugarcane
bagasse favored the successive cracking of HDPE primary volatiles
to  promote  aliphatic  compounds  with  lower  carbon  number.  Oil
obtained from co-pyrolysis can be a precursor for oil fraction with
hydrocarbons distribution in the range of C
25 [132] . However,
when catalyst (mesoporous faujasite-type zeolite from electric arc
furnace  slag)  was  added  in  the  co-pyrolysis  (at  1:6  catalyst  to
feedstock ratio), the maximum pyrolysis oil could reach 68.56 wt.%
with HDPE-to-sugarcane bagasse ratio of 40:60 at 500 °C. This is
because  catalyst  with  strong  acidic  sites  eased  the  diffusion  of
a  wide  range  of  molecular  sizes  into  the  catalyst  pore  that  en-
hanced the cracking and deoxygenation of oxygenates to hydrocar-
bons [101] .

13 –C

Chen et al. studied co-pyrolysis of waste newspaper and HDPE
to  determine  the  synergistic  effects  from  oil  characterization
[69] and enhanced yields of alcohols and hydrocarbons [133] . The
synergistic effect was observed in the temperature range of 400–
500 °C in the form of increased oil phase by 31.6% as compared
to weighted aggregate data of individual HDPE and waste newspa-
per. Positive synergistic effects on fuel properties of co-pyrolysis
oil  were  also  observed  in  the  form  of  a  significant  decrease  in
viscosity and total acid number by 76% and 216%, respectively, in
comparison to weighted aggregate data. Waste newspaper pyroly-
sis resulted in mainly oxygenated compounds in its pyrolysis oil,
while HDPE produced hydrocarbons [69] . The maximum yields of
alcohols and hydrocarbons of 85.9% were obtained at a feed ra-
tio of 50:50 wt.% at 600 °C from the results obtained using a wide
range of waste newspaper to HDPE feed ratios (100:0, 75:25, 50:50,
25:75, 0:100) and temperatures in the range of 50 0-80 0 °C [133] .
Fig. 6 shows the effect of hydrogen supplements and deoxygena-
tion by HDPE resulted in the conversion of aldehyde/ketones (gly-
oxal, methyl glyoxal and methyl vinyl ketone) derived from waste
newspaper into hydrocarbons and subsequently the fragments re-
combination favoring the formation of branched hydrocarbons.

Co-pyrolysis of HDPE and solid biomass can also enhance the
yield of liquid and non-condensable gases. Compared to red oak

pyrolysis, co-pyrolysis of HDPE and red oak improved the yield of
organic phase oil from 23.1 to 32.5 wt.% of total feedstock. How-
ever,  the  aqueous  phase  yield  decreased  from  27.2  to  22.7  wt.%
of  the  feedstock.  The  addition  of  HDPE  increased  the  formation
of  furans,  acids,  and  methyl  or  propenyl  phenols,  and  enhanced
dehydration and hydrodeoxygenation reactions while it decreased
the amount of vanillin [134] . Compared to pyrolysis-oil from solid
biomass (almond shell) alone, presence of HDPE in co-pyrolysis can
remarkably reduce the oxygen content in the pyrolysis liquid prod-
ucts (as reported from FT-IR diagnostics showing decreased inten-
sities in 3400–3244 cm −1 and 1717–1714 cm −1 frequency ranges).
So, liquids obtained from the pyrolysis of HDPE and co-pyrolysis of
biomass/HDPE mixtures are likely to have a higher energy content
because of their high H/C ratio. Co-pyrolysis of HDPE and almond
shell (ratio = 1:1) lead to an expected increase of alkene fractions
by 75% as compared to the results obtained from individual pyrol-
ysis of almond shell [131] .

Yuan et al. [107] investigated the synergistic effects during co-
pyrolysis  of  cellulose  and  HDPE  at  mass  ratios  of  3:1,  1:1,  and
1:3. Their results showed that co-pyrolysis elevated the release of
small-molecule volatiles with such effect being strongest at cellu-
lose: HDPE blend ratio of 1:3. Hydrogen transfer from the chain
scission  of  HDPE  could  promote  decomposition  of  cellulose,  and
this  scission  and  cracking  of  HDPE  could  be  promoted  by  oxy-
genates from cellulose, see Fig. 7 .

Potatoes are essential food crop for regular diet of everyone in
the world so that potato and potato skin become an important part
of kitchen waste and a promising candidate for biomass/biowaste.
Xiong et al. and Önal et al. investigated co-pyrolysis of HDPE and
potato material using thermogravimetric analyzer and a fixed bed
reactor  [ 70 , 135 ].  The  main  thermal  degradation  took  place  be-
tween  178  and  378  °C,  while  the  HDPE  decomposition  occurred
in  a  single  stage  from  about  400  °C.  The  differences  of  weight
loss  between  experimental  and  weighted  aggregate  values  were
less than ±8% in co-pyrolysis while the apparent activation ener-
gies of blends were almost invariable. When different mixtures of
HDPE and potato were introduced into the center of the furnace
at 500 °C, the yield of condensed fraction (mixture of wax, oil and
biomass  tar)  increased  from  55.4%  to  88.4%,  while  the  gas  yield
gradually decreased from 19.4% to 11.6% with increased proportions
of HDPE in the mixture. Moreover, the solids yield decreased lin-
early from 25.2% to 0 (see Fig. 8 (a)) [70] . Potato skin decomposed
at lower temperature with mass loss to occur up to 180–200 °C,
while  HDPE  began  to  decompose  at  around  430  °C  and  showed

maximum mass loss around 470 °C. Compared to single biomass
pyrolysis at 500 °C, co-pyrolysis resulted in increased liquid yields.
Pyrolysis  oil  yield  obtained from the  co-pyrolysis using  different
mixtures of HDPE/potato skin was 41% for 1:1 mixture ratio, which
increased to 50% for 2:1 mixture of HDPE/potato skin, see Fig. 8 (b).
Carbon and hydrogen contents were increased, while the oxygen
content  decreased.  The  pyrolysis  oil  produced  from  co-pyrolysis
provided  high  energy  content  with  calorific  values  of  44.0–45.6
MJ/kg. The results of co-pyrolysis of pure and waste HDPE mate-
rials with potato skin were also compared, however, the products
yield was similar due to nearly the same ingredients of the poly-
mers [135] .

3.3. PVC and solid biomass

Polyvinylchloride (PVC) is the third largest thermoplastic com-
modity,  which  is  one  of  the  cheapest  thermoplastic  commodity
that accounts for some 16% of the global plastic consumption [120] .
It  is  a  major  source  of  halogen  in  MSW  which  makes  its  recy-
cling rather problematic. Environmental pollution from the release
of  halogens  could  be  caused  by  PVC,  along  with  the  other  im-
pacts during waste to energy conversion [136] . Chlorine is a harm-
ful component in PVC as the disposal of PVC via thermal conver-
sion  has  been  restricted  due  to  the  release  of  hazardous  chlori-
nated compounds and dioxins at elevated temperatures, which are
known to lead to process complications such as catalyst poisoning
and corrosion of plant equipment that requires increased expenses
for cleaning-up of the flue-gases [78] .

In co-pyrolysis of PVC and solid biomass, PVC usually provide a
positive synergy on solid residues [ 39 , 76 , 81 , 104 , 137 ]. Co-pyrolysis
of pine wood and PVC blends produced more char (15.5-27.9%) and
less oil (7.2-14.4%) than weighted aggregate values due to decrease
in the H/C atomic ratio that resulted in improved chemical stability
of char [39] . Hydrogen chloride from PVC could make a complex
physicochemical reaction with tobacco stalk leading to increased
yield  of  coke  by  11–12%  and  inhibited  gas  release  [81] .  Further-
more this provided a positive synergetic effect on char yield with a
maximum value of 8 wt. % from a mixture of 30 wt.% PVC in poplar
wood [76] . This was double the amounts of solid products yield
(wt.%) compared to the theoretical yield for a 1:1 weight ratio mix-
ture of PVC and biomass (hazelnut shell, sunflower residues and E.
rigida) [123] . These may be due to the reaction of HCl, released by
the cracking of PVC with the biomass components to promote the
dehydration  and  cross-linking  of  cellulose,  that  inhibited  the  re-
lease of volatiles, and promoted the charring of cellulose [ 81 , 138 ].
The  addition  of  PVC  could  cause  the  degradation  of  cellulose  at
lower temperature with improved yield of char compared to pure
PVC and cellulose. Co-pyrolysis of cellulose and PVC showed inter-
action  with  dehydration  and  production  of  aldehyde  compounds
from  cellulose  and  HCl  evolution.  HCl  evolution  from  PVC  may
act  as  an  acidic  catalyst  to  promote  anhydro-cellulose  and  char-

ring rather than depolymerization of cellulose [139] . Alternatively
it may improve the kinetics of biomass decomposition and lead to
transfer the heterocyclic aromatics to PAHs [39] . PVC showed a sig-
nificant synergy in char yield from co-pyrolysis with solid biomass
[ 39 , 49 , 76 ]. However, co-pyrolysis of poplar wood and PVC blends
showed a significant synergistic improvement in oil yield with a
maximum value of 11 wt.% (for 1:1 weight ratio) [76] .

Zhou  et  al.  [137]  investigated  the  interactions  of  co-pyrolysis
of PVC with rice or with poplar wood using TG-FTIR diagnostics.
Compared  to  co-pyrolysis  of  rice  and  poplar  wood,  the  interac-
tion from co-pyrolysis of PVC and rice, and PVC and poplar wood
were more notable. The addition of PVC to rice and poplar wood
2 and CO to occur earlier but with
promoted the generation of CO
slower kinetics. Between 350 and 500 °C, HCl generated from PVC
participated in the pyrolysis of rice and organic chlorides. This is
because the second and third peaks of HCl did not appear in FTIR
analysis of PVC and biomass mixture, which differed from the re-
sults  of  linear  superposition.  Özsin  et  al.  [140]  found  PVC  could
change  pyrolytic  behavior  of  lignocellulosic  biomass  in  terms  of
reactivity  and  activation  energy.  The  reactivity  of  co-pyrolysis  of
cherry  seed/PVC  was  two  orders  of  magnitude  higher  compared
to  pyrolysis  of  cherry  seed,  both  examined  at  the  heating  rates.
This increase in reactivity may be attributed to the chemical struc-
ture  of  PVC,  which  includes  chloride  ions  with  high  electroneg-
ativity.  The  experimental  data  on  mean  activation  energies  from
co-pyrolysis  were  160.6 to  170.8kJ/mol.  These  values  were  differ-
ent from the calculated mean activation energy values of 162.2 to
258.9 kJ/mol. These results revealed clear indication on synergistic
effect in co-pyrolysis of cheery seed and PVC.

PVC is the only plastic containing Cl content, and efficient re-
moval of HCl gas or halogens from PVC during pyrolysis is benefi-
cial for the environment during waste to energy conversion [136] .
Kuramochi et al. [141] investigated co-pyrolysis of 90–99 wt.% of
demolition  wood  with  1–9  wt.%  of  PVC  at  600  °C,  and  found
that PVC addition of 1 wt.% in co-pyrolysis could significantly re-
duce  HCl  emission.  The  presence  of  hemicellulose  is  a  key  fac-
tor in reducing HCl emission at low blended ratio of PVC in solid
biomass.  The  Cl  content  of  pyrolysis  char  and  tar  was  low,  but
the Cl content of organic compounds detected in aqueous solution
was high (about 30%), which revealed that PVC derived HCl was
partially  converted  into  organic  chlorinated  compounds.  Braden
et al. [136] conducted co-pyrolysis of mixture of cellulose and PVC
(at 1.25–3.75 wt.%) in a polar aprotic solvent. PVC decomposed in
tetrahydrofuran at early stage of reaction evolving HCl, which cat-
alytically improved cellulose depolymerization and accelerated the
conversion. Tetrahydrofuran and water co-solvent could further the
conversion rate  and  increase liquid yield  (see  Fig. 9 )  to  a  maxi-
mum value of 92%. Co-pyrolysis of cellulose and PVC yielded no
chlorinated organics in the vapors, however, 4-chlorobutanol was
formed in the liquid product wherein the PVC derived HCl reacted
with tetrahydrofuran at elevated temperatures [136] . Soybean pro-

on  the  liquid  yield  [83] .  Significant  improvement  has  been  ob-
served in the calorific value of oil produced from co-pyrolysis of
LDPE and biomass, such as sugarcane bagasse. The interaction be-
tween sugarcane bagasse and LDPE during co-pyrolysis decreased
the amounts of oxygenated compounds to produce high calorific
value  oil  of  around  40  MJ/kg  with  reduced  water  content.  LDPE
can act  as  a H-donor  media for  liquid formation during  the  co-
pyrolysis  process.  The  blends  of  liquid  yield  consisted  of  mainly
aliphatic compounds and less aromatic compounds as compared to
individual biomass [146] .

Yang et al. [147] investigated co-pyrolysis of LDPE with three
different biomass (cedar wood, sunflower stalk and Fallopia Japon-
ica  stem)  and  found  synergistic  increases  in  relative  oil  yields.
Maximum  relative  oil  yield  was  obtained  at  600  °C,  which  was
significantly  higher  than  that  from  biomass  or  LDPE  pyrolysis.
Fig.  10  shows  GC/MS  chromatographs  of  these  oils  that  reveals
the  peak  positions  of  oil  from  co-pyrolysis  to  be  rather  simi-
lar  to  that  from  LDPE  pyrolysis  alone.  However,  some  hydrocar-
bons with larger molecule weight ( > C
12 ) were produced from co-
pyrolysis because of the reactions between decomposed products
from biomass and plastic. The inorganic elements in biomass im-
proved the decomposition of LDPE. Increase in reaction tempera-
ture initiated the decomposition of LDPE. The volatiles generated in
the pyrolysis of biomass reacted with the decomposition products
from LDPE to form new species. The co-pyrolysis of pine and LDPE
enhanced the selectivity and yield of aromatics including benzene,
toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene (BTEXs). The addition of LDPE also
improved the selectivity for naphthalene family products (such as,
methylnaphthalene and 2-methylnaphthalene) during catalytic co-
pyrolysis with biomass [85] .

3.5. PP and solid biomass

Polypropylene  (PP)  represents  the  largest  commodity  of  ther-
moplastics (by volume) in the world and accounts for some 23%
of the global plastic material consumption [120] . Estimates reveal
that 60% of the waste thermoplastics produced in Europe is com-
posed  of  polyolefins,  and  polypropylene  and  is  one  of  the  most
widely used polymers in this continent [100] . Automotive manu-
facturers recycle used PP into re-granulated PP, however, its wider
use is limited because of high quality requirements for new mate-
rial and lack of technology availability for the production of con-
sumer products from the recycled polymer [100] .

Various  studies  have  focused  on  synergistic  effect  in  co-
pyrolysis of PP and solid biomass, especially on synergy for chem-
ical  composition  of  pyrolysis-oils.  Oils  obtained  from  wood  and
PP  mixtures  were  rich  in  hydrogen.  However,  the  liquids  ob-
tained from pinewood mainly consisted of oxygen-containing com-
pounds with high proportion of phenols, aldehydes and ketones.
The chemical composition of pyrolysis oil from wood and PP mix-
tures was more similar to the composition of oils obtained from
pure  polypropylene.  Decomposition  products  in  the  investigated
pyrolysis oil were dominated by the volatiles from PP decomposi-
tion when the mixture had 50 (by wt.%) solid biomass [148] . Duan
et al. [149] investigated co-pyrolysis of lignin and PP to produce
oil with cycloalkanes and aromatics. Their results showed a posi-
tive synergistic effect between lignin and PP using ex-situ catalytic
pyrolysis. The char yield was significantly decreased, and the yield
of pyrolysis oil improved during co-pyrolysis as compared to that
obtained from lignin pyrolysis. The oxygenate content significantly
decreased  to  a  minimum  value  of  6.7%  at  1:1  ratio  of  lignin  to
polypropylene. Zhao et al. [150] studied microwave-assisted ex-situ
catalytic co-pyrolysis of bamboo and PP for pyrolysis oil produc-
tion and showed that pyrolysis oil yield could reach to a maximum
value of 61.6 wt.%. The addition of PP improved the proportions of
aromatics and naphthenic hydrocarbons.

Fig. 9.  Reaction mechanism during co-conversion of cellulose and PVC with co-
solvent [136] . [Copyrights 2018 reproduced with permission from Elsevier Science].

tein of organic food waste (nitrogen enriched food) and PVC were
chosen  as  main  components  in  MSW  and  their  interaction  dur-
ing co-pyrolysis was investigated by Tang et al. [78] . Their results
showed formation of more light and heavy Polycyclic Aromatic Hy-
drocarbons (PAHs) compounds (by as much as 2–6 times) and less
nitrogen-containing components (by 61–93%) from the tar derived
from mixtures. This was because the HCl evolved from PVC pro-
moted the evolution of light to heavy components and then the tar
composition  shifted  toward  higher  molecular  weight  substances.
To  avoid  inhibitive interaction,  sorting  and  de-chlorination  could
be adopted before the pyrolysis of PVC-containing MSW, and pre-
heating to approximately 380 °C that provided the expected release
for most of the chlorine in PVC, based on TG analysis [78] .

Co-pyrolysis  of  PVC  and  solid  biomass  (e.g.  wood  and  paper)
was  also  investigated  to  incorporate  chlorine  on  the  surface  of
the  char,  and  the  synthesized  Cl-Char  composite  was  examined
as a sorbent to remove elemental mercury. Hg-removal efficiency
of Cl-Char improved compared to raw char (by as much as 2.5–5
times) and reached nearly 90% at 140 °C [142] . Magnetic chlori-
3 -laden wood and PVC
nated biochar from co-pyrolysis of Fe(NO
waste could efficiently and effectively remove elemental mercury
[143] . Co-pyrolysis of biomass with KOH greatly improved the sur-
face area of bio-char, and the addition of PVC further improved its
surface area to achieve maximum toluene adsorption capacity of
263.4 mg/g [144] .

3.4. LDPE and solid biomass

Low density polyethylene (LDPE) is the second largest volume
of  commodity  used  as  thermoplastic.  It  is  the  cheapest  thermo-
plastic and accounts for about 17 % of the global plastic consump-
tion [120] . LDPE consists of more branching (about 2% of the car-
bon atoms) than HDPE, and its intermolecular forces are weaker
than that of HDPE. It is of low tensile strength but has higher re-
silience and flexibility compared to HDPE. Lower density compared
to HDPE is from the less tightly packed molecules and lower crys-
tallinity due to the side branching [145] .

Co-pyrolysis of LDPE and cellulose synergistically increased the
yield  of  liquid  products,  with  83%  increase  in  energy  recovery,
compared to a mixture of the liquid products produced from py-
rolysis of individual components. The sum of the synergies during
devolatilization and condensation was similar to the overall syn-
ergy  observed  during  co-pyrolysis  of  the  mixture,  thus  confirm-
ing contributions of both to the overall positive synergistic effect

The  synergy  effect  in  aromatic  hydrocarbons  production  was
also  observed  by  Lee  et  al.  [151]  from  their  studies  on  catalytic
co-pyrolysis of torrefied cellulose and raw cellulose with PP over
HZSM-5 catalyst. The lowest cellulose to PP ratio (1:3) examined in
catalytic pyrolysis (using HZSM-5 catalyst) revealed that both tor-
refied cellulose-PP and raw cellulose-PP mixtures provided higher
experimental yields for BTEXs (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and
xylene) than their calculated yields from individual components in
the mixture. This can be explained by the supply of sufficient light
olefins produced from the pyrolysis of large amounts of PP. When
cellulose to PP ratio was 1:1, higher experimental yield for BTEXs
was obtained only from the torrefied cellulose-PP mixture sample.
However, when cellulose to PP ratio was 3:1 in the system, both
torrefied and raw cellulose exhibited lower experimental yields of
BTEXs. This suggests that a sufficient amount of light olefins needs
to be supplied to the system to induce a positive synergy on aro-
matic hydrocarbons from the PP [151] . The maximum BTEXs yield
of 33.4 wt.% was achieved from the catalytic co-pyrolysis of tor-
refied cellulose and PP at a catalyst to sample ratio of 3:1 and a
torrefied cellulose to PP ratio of 1:3 [151] . Akancha et al. [152] in-
vestigated co-pyrolysis of waste PP and rice bran wax (RBW). Their
results revealed that increase in temperature from 400 °C to 500
°C, increased the liquid yield of PP (1:0) and reached a maximum

value of 75.6% at 500 °C. In addition, a decrease in liquid yield was
also observed from 550 °C to 650 °C. Similarly, liquid yield of RBW
(0:1) was observed to increase from 400 °C to 600 °C, reaching to
a maximum yield of 86.5%. Pyrolytic oil at 550 °C produced from
1:3 blend of PP and rice bran provided the most suitable blend for
optimum yield of 80.5% (see Fig. 11 ) with calorific value of 43.76
MJ/kg.  The  liquid  fuel  contents,  higher  aliphatic  compounds  and
the physical properties of the pyrolytic oil were fairly comparable
to normal diesel and gasoline fuels. Paradela et al. [153] studied
co-pyrolysis  of  PP  and  pine  wood  and  their  results  showed  co-
pyrolysis provided higher liquid and lower solid yields compared
to slow pyrolysis carbonization of biomass. The addition of PP im-
proved the overall efficiency compared to pyrolysis of pine wood
alone.  The  heating  values  of  obtained  liquids  from  co-pyrolysis
were similar to that of fuel oil from petroleum fuels. The distilla-
tion curves of the liquids were between that from typical gasoline
and diesel.

Sajdak et al. investigated co-pyrolysis of PP with pine wood and
alder wood using a solid fuels pyrolysis system to show the pres-
ence of synergy as well as reduction of thermal energy needed for
conversion [100] . Blending of 30 wt.% PP in mixture decreased the
yield  of  liquid  products  by  1.5–2.5%  compared  to  the  calculated
value of PP and biomass, wherein the fractions of solid and gas

phase  increased.  The  addition  of  PP  reduced  the  energy  needed
in  the  thermal  conversion  of  biomass.  In  addition,  the  synergy
from co-pyrolysis was due to the reactions between the radicals
formed during the binding process and depolymerization of cellu-
lose, hemicellulose and lignin [100] . Addition of PP was noted to
provide an influence on the reduction of sulfur and oxygen con-
tents in the solid fraction, and an indirect influence on increased
heating value of the char. However, co-pyrolysis had a negative in-
fluence  on  the  properties  of  the  gaseous  fraction  with  less  con-
centration of CO
2 [154] . Furthermore, co-pyrolysis of
biomass with a small addition of PP was able facilitate the mainte-
nance of entire process of autothermal condition, even in the case
of raw biomass with high humidity. This was because of heating
value released from PP could cover the full energy demands in the
optimization of co-pyrolysis process [155] .

3.6. PS and solid biomass

Polystyrene (PS) is usually used in food packaging and other ap-
plications. It is also found in waste that is inevitably spoiled by
food and paper waste limiting their recyclability. PS accounts for
about  7%  of  the  global  plastic  consumption  [120] .  The  structure
of  PS  strongly  influences  the  chemical  composition  of  resulting
oils produced from this material [148] . Toluene, ethylbenzene and
naphthalene were produced in greater amounts when PS was sub-
jected to catalytic fast pyrolysis with cellulose versus other plastics
[129] .

Many studies have focused on synergistic effect in co-pyrolysis
of PS and solid biomass. Oyedun et al. [38] investigated synergistic
effects in co-pyrolysis of PS and bamboo waste and their results
showed that mass loss and volatile generation profiles have signif-
icant interactions in the mixture, to reveal appreciable synergy ef-
fect on the reduced energy usage in co-pyrolysis when the ratio of
PS to biomass was 25 to 75. Özsin and Pütün [92] reported on the
effect of co-pyrolysis of PS and biomass (walnut shell and peach
stones) during thermal decomposition by utilizing model-free iso-
conversional methods. Blending of biomass with PS decreased the
activation energy to result in multi-step reaction mechanisms. PS
addition increased reactivities of walnut shell and peach stones be-
cause the addition of PS increased the values of pyrolytic degra-
dation process considerably, such as the maximum pyrolysis rate,
as well as the initial and final temperature of the pyrolysis zone.
Déparrois et al. [19] studied co-pyrolysis of paper and PS blends
in different mixture ratios at 1173 K and showed that co-pyrolysis
positively impacted the syngas yield exhibiting a synergistic influ-
ence on cracking reactions leading to increased gaseous yield. Their
results showed almost double the amounts of hydrogen yield, and
that  the  product  gas  yields  and  conversion  were  enhanced  with
increase in PS content in the mixture. Muneer et al. [93] investi-
gated co-pyrolysis of corn stalk and PS for liquid yield and quality
and showed a maximum synergistic value at a ratio of 1:3 during
non-catalytic  co-pyrolysis  tests.  Sanahuja-Parejo  et  al.  [156]  con-
ducted co-pyrolysis of grape seeds and PS in a fixed-bed reactor,

15

and  found  significant  positive  synergistic  effects  when  PS  (5–40
wt.%) was added to the grape seeds. Fuel properties of the pyroly-
sis oil were also upgraded with oxygen contents reduced to 7.7 and
6.3 wt.% with the addition of 20 and 40 wt.% of PS, respectively to
the mixture compared to only 14 wt.% with biomass alone; higher
heating  values  were  increased  to  39  MJ/kg  with  addition  of  20
and 40 wt.% of PS to the mixture compared to 36 MJ/kg from the
biomass  alone.  The  simplified  reaction  mechanism  proposed  for
the co-pyrolysis of grape seeds (including cellulose, hemicellulose,
lignin and fatty acids) and PS is showed in Fig. 12 .

Addition  of  PS  in  solid  biomass  are  usually  favorable  to  im-
prove  the  oil  or  liquid  yield.  Abnisa  et  al.  [157]  mainly  investi-
gated  co-pyrolysis  of  PS  and  palm  shell  to  obtain  liquid  fuel  by
considering effective parameters of temperature, feed ratio and re-
action time. Maximum liquid yield of 68.3% was achieved at 600
°C with a palm shell to PS ratio of 40:60, after a reaction time of
45 min. The liquid was dominated by aliphatic and aromatic hy-
drocarbons with 40.3MJ/kg heating value, 1.9 wt.% water content
and 4.2 wt.% oxygen content. Shadangi et al. [158] used non-edible
seed (Karanja and Niger) for co-pyrolysis with PS to improve the
properties of produced oil. Their results showed that co-pyrolysis
with PS increased the calorific value, decreased the viscosity and
pH of oil, and that the co-pyrolysis had a positive synergetic ef-
fect on the quality of co-pyrolytic oil. Suriapparao et al. [103] used
PS to improve the quality of oil from co-pyrolysis with five differ-
ent solid biomass i.e. groundnut shell, bagasse, rice husk, prosopis
juliflora and mixed wood sawdust. The pyrolysis oil yields from PS
and biomass blends was obtained between 51–60 wt.% with max-
imum yield achieved from co-pyrolysis of PS and wood sawdust.
However, the maximum energy yield in pyrolysis oil was from a
mixture of PS and 80 wt.% rice husks. The viscosity of co-pyrolysis
oil from PS-biomass mixtures was lower compared to bio-oil from
biomass pyrolysis. Reshad et al. [159] investigated co-pyrolysis of
rubber seed cake and PS, which showed increased yield of liquid
product from 48.3 wt.% (at 1:0 ratio of rubber seed cake and PS)
to  65.9 wt.%  (at  1:2  ratio  of  rubber  seed  cake  and  PS).  Further-
more, the oil quality was improved with heating value increased
from  32.3 MJ/kg  to  37.5–41.1 MJ/kg  and  water  content  decreased
from 11.6 wt.% to 2.4 wt.%. Van Nguyen et al. [160] studied the co-
pyrolysis of pine sawdust and PS to improve the oil quality con-
sidering the high heating value and non-oxygen composition of PS.
Compared to oil yield of 48.8 wt.% with heating value of 17.8 MJ/kg
from pine sawdust pyrolysis, the mixture with 25% pine sawdust
and 75% PS resulted in oil with higher yield (63.3 wt.%) and higher
heating value (39.7 MJ/kg) at 500 °C. In general, with increase of PS
content in the mixture, the amounts of liquid and pyrolysis oil in-
creased while char and non-condensable gas decreased, see Fig. 13
[ 157 , 159 ]. The bio-oil yield from pure biomass was only a quarter
of that from pure PS, see Fig. 13 (b).

PS  pyrolysis  produces  styrene  monomer  via  end-chain  β-
scission  or  unzipping  reaction.  Özsin  and  Pütün  [161]  studied
the  co-pyrolysis  of  the  PS  and  solid  biomass  (walnut  shells  and
peach stones) mixture. Their results showed quality improvement

of  pyrolysis  products  and  tar  yields  (44.8  and  49.8 wt.%,  respec-
tively) were higher than the weighted aggregate yields (43.7 and
43.6 wt.%).  Liquid  products  contained  large  amounts  of  benzene
and its derivatives of 80.8% and 88.5%, respectively. The majority
of aromatics, such as benzene, toluene, and styrene and other low
molecular weight aromatic hydrocarbons were conjectured to be
formed when biomass and PS interacted through free radicals orig-
inating from pyrolysis of PS.

3.7. Others plastic and solid biomass

Polyurethanes (PU) are one of the largest polymers class with
properties that  can  be customized  for various  applications. They
can  be  thermosetting  or  thermoplastic,  rigid  and  hard  or  flexi-
ble and soft. Polycarbonates (PC) are amongst the largest volume
sales in engineering for thermo-plastic applications. Polypropylene
carbonate (PPC), polyethylene carbonate (PEC), and poly cyclohex-
ene carbonate (PCHC) are of most commercial importance [120] .
Acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) is one of the industrial plas-
tics used to produce structural frames, pipelines [162] and in au-

tomotive body parts [61] . ABS is mainly made of three different
monomers that provide different f eatures; heat tolerance is pro-
vided  by  acrylonitrile,  robust  impact  strength  by  butadiene,  and
rigidity  by  styrene  [163] . Wang  et  al.  [40]  investigated  synergis-
tic effects in co-pyrolysis of biomass and PU focusing on the yield,
reactivity, and heating value of biochar in the temperature range
of 1100 °C to 1250 °C. Their results showed higher char yields and
heating values compared to mono-pyrolysis. However, co-pyrolysis
with biomass promoted the fragmentation of plastic-char. The syn-
ergistic  effect  is  stronger  in  wood  co-pyrolysis  than  straw  co-
pyrolysis and at lower temperatures. Wang et al. [164] also stud-
ied synergistic effect in co-pyrolysis of PU and biomass and found
lower  soot  yield  from  co-pyrolysis  of  biomass  and  PU  than  the
theoretical  value  based  on  weighted  averages.  Jin  et  al.  [41]  ex-
plored synergistic effects at temperatures below 900 °C and 1100
°C  and  showed  that  synergistic  effect  of  co-pyrolysis  resulted  in
higher char yields but lower tar yields at temperatures below 900
°C. However, at temperatures below 1100 °C co-pyrolysis inhibited
the gas and soot formation, resulting in higher tar yields and this
was attributed to different soot morphologies.

PC  co-pyrolysis  with  biomass  (at  50  wt.%  PC)  showed  signif-
icant  enhancement  in  the  pyrolytic  behavior  compared  to  other
blends of plastic (PP, PET) and biomass [2] . Co-pyrolysis of lignin
with plastic polymers attained the strongest interaction between
lignin and PC compared to other blends of plastic (PS, LDPE) and
lignin. The H
2 O produced from the decomposition of lignin at low
temperature was proposed to promote the hydrolytic reaction of
2  [87] .  Co-pyrolysis  of  lignin  with  PC
PC  and  the  release  of  CO
strongly decreased the amounts of water phase and increased the
amounts of oil phase. Presence of PC also showed a strong decrease
of solid residue ( ∼12.5 wt.%). The oil from co-pyrolysis of PC with
lignin was much concentrated in phenol family products [165] . The
results obtained from the catalytic upgrading of co-pyrolysis oils
from PC (bisphenol A) and lignin showed that the composition of
the pyrolysis oils could be catalyzed to lighter compounds by con-
verting the bisphenol A into phenol and its derivatives [166] .

To the best of our knowledge, no studies are available on co-
pyrolysis of ABS and biomass mixture, but studies exist on the co-
pyrolysis of solid biomass with mixtures of different plastics (40
wt.% PET, 30% wt.% PP and 30% wt.% ABS) [61] . The liquid yields
from their co-pyrolysis followed quite a strong upward trend with
increase in temperature and with the addition of mixture of plas-
tics.

4. Co-pyrolysis with different methods and reactors

The  reported  methods  for  co-pyrolysis  of  plastic  and  solid
biomass include micro-scale characteristics of co-pyrolysis, such as
TGA, TG-MS, TG-FTIR, Py-GC/MS, and co-pyrolysis in different reac-
tors, such as fixed-bed reactors, fluidized bed reactors, microwave
reactors and other multi-step reactors. These are provided in the
following sections.

4.1. Micro-scale characteristics of co-pyrolysis

4.1.1. TGA for co-pyrolysis

Thermogravimetric  analysis  (TGA)  is  a  widely  applicable
method to examine co-pyrolysis of plastic and solid biomass for
reaction kinetics [ 27 , 63 ] and to examine synergistic effects [ 2 , 126 ].
These thermal and kinetic analysis of plastic and solid biomass are
essential for unraveling their conversion into fuel and also for the
process parameter optimization and design of efficient gasification
and pyrolysis reactors. Moreover, these results can be mathemati-
cally modeled for parameters including activation energy ( E a ), fre-
quency factor (A), and order of reaction ( n ) for quantitative kinetic
analysis[27]. These results can then be incorporated into mathe-
matical modeling for the development of advanced reactors

Approximated  methods  such  as  Ozawa–Flynn–Wall  (OFW),
Kissinger–Akahira–Sunose  (KAS),  Friedman  methods,  Coats–
Redfern,  Starink  (ST),  and  distributed  activation  energy  model
(DAEM)  are  usually  applied  [ 82 , 126 ].  Among  the  above  methods
DAEM is widely used to describe kinetics of pyrolysis for biomass
pyrolysis  as  it  allows  for  a  more  effective  visualization  of  the
results and fits the differential thermogravimetric curve (DTG) by
a series of parallel reactions of first-order with a distribution of
kinetic parameters instead of a single value [82] .

A generic global equation of heterogeneous solid pyrolysis that
could be used for mixtures of plastic and solid biomass over a lin-
ear temperature range of heating rate were described and are given
in the following [ 68 , 85 , 105 ]:

Plastic + soilidbiomass

k ( T )
−−→ Char + Volatiles

(4)

where, volatiles refer to the sum  of the gas and tar and k (T) is
the pyrolysis rate constant whose temperature dependency is ex-

pressed by the Arrhenius equation:

where, m
f are the initial, actual, and final mass of the
samples, respectively, and m α is the instantaneous mass. The f( α)
is given by:
f (α) = (1 − α) n

f or n = 1

(7)

The rate constant is defined as:
(cid:3)

k ( T ) = A × exp

(8)

where,  A = pre-exponential  factor,  min -1 ;  E a = activation  en-
ergy,  kJ/mol;  R = universal  gas  constant,  8.314  J/(mol • K));
T = temperature, K; t = time, s.
This equation then leads to:

In this equation, the right-hand side has no exact solution and
thus various approximate solutions were proposed and used to de-
termine the activation energy and pre-exponential factor including
Kissinger–Akahira–Sunose, Ozawa–Flynn–Wall, Friedman methods,
Coats–Redfern, Starink models which rely on approximations of the
above equation:

E a  and ln(A) can be obtained from the slope and intercept of
function ln(-ln(1- α)) versus 1/T revealing their dependence on the
degree of conversion. In the case of DAEM, instead of a single re-
action, the global kinetics is assumed to be a serial combination
of multiple reactions whose kinetic parameters are represented by
a uniform distribution function such as Gaussian and Weibull dis-
tributions. Such a method is used followed by error minimization
to obtain the activation energy and pre-exponential factor distribu-
tions over complete conversion and invariant of conversion degree.
Kinetic parameters analysis (activation energy distributions at
different degree of conversion) for several typical co-pyrolysis of
plastic and solid biomass are showed in Fig. 14 .

Fig. 14.  Kinetic parameters (activation energy distributions at different degree of conversion) for co-pyrolysis of plastic and solid biomass. (a) PVC, PP with tobacco stalk (TS),
weight ratio of plastic : tobacco stalk = 1:1 [81] . (b) HDPE, PP, PET with paper waste (BM), plastic mixtures, PM is [HDPE + PP + PET = (1:1:1)], BP is biomass/plastic mixtures
(BP1 = weight ratio of biomass to plastic of 9:1, BP2 = weight ratio of biomass to plastic of 3:1, BP3 = weight ratio of biomass to plastic of 1:1, BP4 = weight ratio of biomass
to plastic of 1:3, and BP5 = weight ratio of biomass to plastic of 1:9) [63] . (c) HDPE, PS with bamboo (using DAEM), weight ratio of plastic : bamboo = 60:40 [96] . (d) HDPE,
LDPE, PP with pine wood sawdust (SW), weight ratio of HDPE:SW and PP: SW = 70:30, weight ratio of LDPE : SW = 45:55 [73] . (e) PET, PVC with cotton stalk(CS) and hazelnut
shell (HS), weight ratio of plastic : solid biomass = 1:1 [37] . (f) PVC with cherry seed (using DAEM), weight ratio of PVC : cherry seed = 1:1 [140] .

Plastics showed higher activation energy compared to tobacco
stalk due to their higher thermal stability, see Fig. 14 (a). Decom-
position of PP started at 400 °C, which was delayed by 50 °C due to
the blending of tobacco stalk. The activation energy of the tobacco
stalk and PVC mixture at stage 1 was reduced by about 50% com-
pared to that of PVC and the synergistic effect dramatically low-
ered the energy requirement during the co-pyrolysis [81] .

From Fig. 14 (b), activation energy values for biomass pyrolysis
are 177 kJ/mol for the first stage, and only 32 kJ/mol for the sec-
ond stage. Among different blends of biomass and plastic, only BP1
sample had activation energies calculated in two different stages:
140 kJ/mol for 1st stage and 204 kJ/mol for 2nd stage. However,
for all others, kinetic parameters were obtained using the one-step
method. In comparing kinetic parameters between the BM and BP1,
the activation energy value of BP1 showed as an intermediate be-
tween  the  BM  and  PM,  which  increased  significantly  by  mixing
only small amounts of plastic. All other blend samples (BP2 to BP5)
showed similar pyrolysis behavior [63] .

As can be seen in Fig. 14 (c), for co-pyrolysis of bamboo with
HDPE  and  PS,  HDPE  was  more  reactive  than  PS  with  higher  E
value of 253.69 kJ/mol. Energy needed for the decomposition of

HDPE/biomass  blends  was  higher  than  that  of  the  PS/biomass
blends [96] .

From  Fig.  14  (d),  one  can  see  that  pine  wood  sawdust  (SW)
and plastic blends pyrolyzed in three stages. The activation ener-
gies ranged from 107 to 128 kJ/mol for the first stage, from 164
to 249 kJ/mol for the second, and from 426 to 498 kJ/mol for the
third  stage.  In  the  first  interval  of  temperatures  (about  286–405
°C), the reactions of SW pyrolysis were not affected significantly by
the presence of plastic, as practically only SW decomposes. Thus,
the activation energy was approximately equal to that of the SW.
In the second interval (405–461 °C), the activation energy of SW/PP
was intermediate between those of SW and PP. In the third inter-
val (461–525 °C), the blend activation energy approached that of
the plastic due to a higher contribution of the plastic. SW/HDPE
and SW/LDPE displayed similar pyrolysis behavior to SWPP [73] .

From Fig. 14 (e), a major part of the polymer conversion com-
pleted at the second step due to exceeding of this energy barrier
(completed conversion before the 3rd step was 81% for PET and
75% for PVC). The addition of polymers caused most of the conver-
sion to occur at earlier stages. The temperature and activation en-
ergy need were higher for the decomposition of biomass and PET

mixtures than those for biomass and PVC mixtures, which may due
to more stability of aromatic ring in the structure of PET [37] .

From Fig. 14 (f), the activation energy of CS pyrolysis slightly
decreased  at  the  initiation  of  pyrolysis,  then  increased  dramati-
cally up to a conversion degree of 0.4. In a conversion degree range
between 0.4 and 0.9, several fluctuations were observed. Fluctua-
tions in activation energy may be attributed to the complex reac-
tion schemes that show the involvement of parallel, complex and
competitive reactions during pyrolysis of lignocellulosic structure.
At a conversion degree between 0.5 and 0.7, the activation energy
of PVC pyrolysis continued to increase, followed by a decrease at
the end. The mean activation energies during the whole conver-
sion range was calculated as 166.5 kJ/mol using the approaches of
DAEM [140] .

In  co-pyrolysis  using  TGA,  activation  energies  and  pre-
exponential factor for these mixtures are usually lower than that
of pure plastic but comparable to solid biomass revealing synergis-
tic effect. Chin et al. [68] and Ng et al. [167] investigated the bi-
nary co-pyrolysis of HDPE and rubber seed shell (at 0.2:0.8 weight
ratio)  and  found  the  kinetic  parameters  for  the  binary  mixtures
to be lower than pure HDPE but comparable to pure rubber seed
shell irrespective of the processes involved. Chin et al. [105] also
found  that  the  activation  energies  for  rubber  seed  shell,  HDPE,
HDPE/ rubber seed shell mixtures were 47–63, 242–278, and 49–
83 kJ/mol, respectively at different heating rates of 10, 20, 30, and
50  K/min  over  the  temperature  range  of  323–1173  K.  Burra  and
Gupta [2] investigated kinetics of synergistic effects in co-pyrolysis
of PC with pinewood and mixtures and showed an overlap in their
activation  energy  distribution  between  100  and  150 kJ/mol.  This
overlap caused the set of reaction with similar energetics to mu-
tually interact chemically and enhance the composite mixture py-
rolysis. Activation energy of PC in the presence of pinewood was
reduced by some 50 kJ/mol compared to individually examined PC
decomposition.  Aboulkas  et  al.  investigated  co-pyrolysis  of  olive
residue and HDPE/LDPE, the results indicated that the addition of
HDPE/LDPE had no influence on the apparent activation energy of
thermal  decomposition  of  olive  residue.  However,  the  activation
energy  of  HDPE/LDPE  in  the  mixture  decreased  slightly.  This  ef-
fect could be due to the catalytic influence of olive residues char
on the radical degradation mechanism of HDPE/LDPE [ 168 , 169 ].

Azizi et al. [170] investigated thermal behavior of co-pyrolysis
of  microalgae,  wood  and  PP  and  found  that  addition  of  PP  de-
creased  peak  temperature  of  wood  and  microalgae.  They  also
showed  that  co-pyrolysis  of  microalgae,  wood  and  PP  showed  a

synergistic  effect  between  the  temperatures  of  300  and  400  °C.
Navarro et al. [64] used DAEM to analyze the co-pyrolysis of pine
woodchips with PS, PET, PP and HDPE using TGA. The DAEM results
accurately accounted for the shape of the fraction of mass remain-
ing curves as well as the shift to higher temperatures at higher
heating rate. Aboulkas et al. [99] studied the pyrolytic decomposi-
tion of mixtures of olive residue and plastic (HDPE, LDPE, PP and
PS). It is noteworthy to indicate here that the activation energies
of plastic in the mixture were lower than those from pure plastic
and the activation energies of the first two stage of olive residue
in the mixture did not significantly change. This is probably due to
the influence of products/char formed during olive residue degra-
dation on plastic degradation processes.

In  order  to  investigate  the  reaction  kinetics,  Mishra  et  al.
[126]  investigated  the  co-pyrolysis  of  PET  and  Samanea  saman
seeds at different blend ratios (1:1, 1:3 and 1:5) and dynamic heat-
ing rates (10, 30 and 50 °C min −1 ) using five model-free methods,
that included Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose, Friedman method, Starink,
Ozawa-Flynn-Wall method, and Coats-Redfern method. The results
showed that blending of PET and Samanea saman seeds at 1:3 pro-
vided higher value of synergistic effect, from the observed maxi-
mum formation of volatiles during pyrolysis. Kinetic analysis con-
firmed that individual samples required higher activation energy
compared to blended PET and that Samanea saman seeds required
1:3 ratio to start the reaction. Zhou et al. [104] also investigated
and  showed  that  PVC  had  strong  interactions  with  several  solid
biomass during co-pyrolysis in TGA (see Fig. 15 ). It should be no-
ticed that, the mass loss usually occurred earlier and faster with
PVC mixed with other fractions, indicating promoted pyrolysis to
occur at low temperatures. DTG peaks from the linear superposi-
tion results were usually weakened, the residue usually increased,
the liberated HCl interacted chemically with the cellulose, and also
probably catalyzing the acid hydrolysis type reactions to make cel-
lulose less stable.

4.1.2. TG coupled with FTIR and MS for co-pyrolysis

Thermogravimetry  coupled  with  Fourier  transform  infrared
spectroscopy  (TG-FTIR),  thermogravimetry  coupled  with  mass

acterization of fossil fuels and renewable energy sources for de-
termining  the  combustion  characteristics  and  kinetic  parameters

FTIR spectra could be obtained for co-pyrolysis of waste plas-
tic and solid biomass at temperature of maximum mass loss rate
from the TG results. The evolution of volatiles during co-pyrolysis
could be attained at varying temperatures. Typical compounds or
functional groups distinguished from the FTIR spectrum obtained
could be also marked [87] . Jin et al. [87] reported that the release
of CO
2 related compounds played an important role in the decom-
position of PC compared to lignin according to the maximum mass
loss at 402 °C, see Fig. 16 . It was suggested that the existence of
lignin can promote decomposition of PC, enhancing the release of

PC.

Co-pyrolysis of waste plastic and solid biomass based on TG-
MS was also suitable that revealed the extent of synergistic reac-
tions. Gunasee et al. [80] investigated the mixture of MSW com-
posed  of  lignocellulosic  and  plastic-based  materials  using  a  TG-
MS. They compared the experimental and calculated weight loss
data and relative areas of MS peaks. The negative synergistic ef-
fects observed between 330 and 550 °C during pyrolysis, associated
with higher activation energy, resulted in the formation of solid
residue that delayed the degradation of lignocellulosic materials.
Yuan et al. [107] studied the synergistic mechanism that occurred
during co-pyrolysis of HDPE and cellulose using TG-MS. The MS
curves of the gas evolved from the samples were synchronous with
the DTG curves. The peak of the main gas products appeared in the
vicinity of DTG peak, and there was a little deviation between the
two peaks which could be attributed to the transmission time of
volatiles through pipes between TG and MS, see Fig. 18 .

TG-FTIR  can  effectively  detect  functional  groups  but  cannot
identify  homoatomic  molecules,  while  TG-MS  cannot  accurately
distinguish the compounds with the same ratio of mass to charge
(m/z). However, TG-FTIR-MS is cumulative method to investigate
and  analyze  diverse  volatile  products  synchronously.  TG-FTIR-MS
can  be  applied  to  investigate  the  evolved  gases  behavior  and
understand  synergistic  effects  during  co-pyrolysis  of  plastic  and
biomass  [71] .  P  ̆arp  ̆ari  ̧t  ̆a  et  al.  [174]  used  TG-FTIR-MS  to  deter-
mine  the  mass  loss  and  associated  decomposition  products  pro-

duced  under  dynamic  heating  of  PP  and  biomass  mixtures.  The
biomass  in  composites  modifies  the  pathway  of  evolution  with
time/temperature  of  the  ionized  fragments  corresponding  to  the
compounds evolved from PP decomposition. Coupling of the FTIR-
MS  revealed  that  the  main  gaseous  products  obtained  from  co-
pyrolysis of PP and biomass were water, carbon dioxide , carbon ox-
ide, formaldehyde, methanol, methane, acetic acid, aldehydes, fu-
rans,  phenols,  guaiacols,  catechols,  etc.  Kai  et  al.  [175]  used  TG-
FTIR-MS  to  investigate  the  effects  of  interactions  between  rice
straw and HDPE on the evolution of volatile species and their dis-
tributions during co-pyrolysis. The interactions between rice straw
and HDPE were obvious in the temperature range of 435–520 °C.
The  presence  of  HDPE  or  rice  straw  delayed  the  decomposition
in a different step. The primary gaseous products for the blends
arose from the overlap of the decomposition products from indi-
vidual rice straw and HDPE. Kai et al. [71] also used this method
to investigate the devolatilization kinetics and product gas evolu-
tion during co-pyrolysis of cornstalk and HDPE. The co-pyrolysis
of HDPE and corn stalk can also be sub-divided into two decom-
position  stages  along  with  the  existence  of  plastic  and  biomass
delayed each other. The blending ratio of cornstalk-HDPE had in-
significant effect on the formation of major gaseous products. The
interaction between cornstalk and HDPE suppressed the produc-

tion of aliphatic hydrocarbons and oxygen-containing compounds
for 40 wt.% and 20 wt.% cornstalk. Özsin and Pütün [140] studied
co-pyrolytic behavior and kinetics of PVC and solid biomass using
TG-FTIR-MS. They examined in-situ determination of co-pyrolytic
degradation compounds such as CH
2 and
benzene  considering  reaction  temperature  and  time,  see  Fig.  19 .
Primary and secondary reactions related to methylation, dehydra-
tion, aromatization, fragmentation, dehydrochlorination were used
for interpretation.

4.1.3. Py-GC/MS for co-pyrolysis

Pyrolysis  or  pyrolyzer  coupled  with  gas  chromatography  and
mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) provides a good means to extend
the  utilization  of  gas  chromatography  to  the  analysis  of  decom-
posing  materials.  Gas  chromatography  can  detect  materials  such
as  gases,  or  liquids  and  solids  at  room  temperatures  by  heating
them in the vapor phase [176] . Py-GC/MS is an excellent diagnostic
tool for polymer analysis [177] . In Py-GC/MS measurements, feed-
stock  in  milligram  scale  was  instantaneously  pyrolyzed  at  about
40 0–90 0  °C  with  a  flow  of  nitrogen  or  helium  carrier  gas  fol-
lowed by separation and analysis of these volatiles using GC/MS
[ 87 , 178 ]. Py-GC/MS has been used for micro-scale fast pyrolysis of
plastics [179] , biomass [180] , mixture of plastic and biomass [85] ,

tect the by-products of fast pyrolysis without the involvement of
secondary reactions [182] , a direct conversion of pyrolysis vapors
over a catalyst bed without any need for vapor condensation and
re-evaporation associated with conventional pyrolysis oil upgrad-
ing methods [130] . The understanding of analysis from Py-GC/MS
is essential for effective utilization of wastes and development of
its application. Pyrolysis temperature, heating rate, and pyrolysis
time are the decisive factors influencing the products of biomass
pyrolysis. Several typical Py-GC/MS experimental settings used in
the experiments are given in Table 4 .

Py-GC/MS  for  co-pyrolysis  could  be  conducted  and  compared
with industrial scale analysis to understand the thermal behavior,
determine  the  relative  amount  of  produced  volatile  compounds,
and  to  identify  the  typical  pyrolysis  products  (chemical  com-
pounds) and chemical groups. The result from the Py-GC/MS eval-
uation could be used to select suitable feedstocks and mixtures for
further verification in pyrolysis pilot experiments [36] . Py-GC/MS
could be used to assess the quality of refuse material for solid fuel
by identifying the degradation behavior and produced gas in py-
rolysis condition, and could be used to build process simulation to
simulate real waste to energy plants [183] .

Many studies are available on co-pyrolysis of waste plastic and
solid biomass using Py-GC/MS to provide an understanding of the
liquid  products  as  well  as  the  associated  improvement  via  im-
proved synergetic effect. Chen et al. [133] investigated co-pyrolysis
of  newspaper  with  HDPE  using  Py-GC/MS,  with  focus  to  under-
stand the bio-fuel intermediates. The effects of feed ratio and feed-
stock temperature on co-pyrolysis derived products, especially al-
cohols and hydrocarbons were evaluated. Jin et al. [87] used Py-
GC/MS to study the co-pyrolysis of black liquor with three kinds of
plastic polymers (LDPE, PC and PS) to study the effect of plastic ad-
dition on products distribution (especially monomer aromatic com-
pounds). The production of several aromatic compounds assigned
to lignin pyrolysis was suppressed by the addition of PC or LDPE,
while the formation of monomer aromatic hydrocarbons was no-
tably promoted for the co-pyrolysis of PS and lignin. Zhang et al.
[59] used Py-GC/MS to investigate efficient production of aromatic
hydrocarbons from co-pyrolysis of corn stalk and HDPE. Their re-
eff of feedstock should be modified to achieve
sults showed that H/C
higher  aromatic  hydrocarbons.  Lin  et  al.  [108]  reported  catalytic
effects of alkali/alkaline earth metals (AAEMs) on co-pyrolysis of
cellulose  and  HDPE  based  on  Py-GC/MS  diagnostics.  Addition  of
potassium inhibited synergy between cellulose and HDPE. Gu et al.
[172] investigated the synergistic effects in co-pyrolysis of  HDPE

22

and xylan using Py-GC/MS, and the results showed that the syn-
ergy  was  attributed  to  the  release  of  hydrogen  radicals,  which
were from mono and bi-molecular dehydrogenation reactions dur-
ing HDPE decomposition, and then they were received by xylan-
derived oxygenates.

4.2. Co-pyrolysis in different reactors

4.2.1. Fixed bed reactor for co-pyrolysis

Fixed  bed  reactor  is  a  simple,  reliable,  and  proven  effective
technology for solid feedstock particles of uniform size. The reactor
is heated by an external energy source. These types of reactors are
mainly used for research and small-scale heat and power applica-
tions [184] . Fixed bed reactor analysis system for co-pyrolysis usu-
ally consists of a reactor or furnace, thermocouple, condenser, gas
collection, storage system, bag or GC analysis, under inert atmo-
sphere conditions. Electric furnaces are often used for thermal field
uniformity  in  the  reactor  to  support  the  endothermic  reactions.
Several typical types of fixed bed reactor system for co-pyrolysis
are listed in Table 5 .

This reactor type can be further divided into horizontal and ver-
tical types. Sample weight of the material is typically of the order
of grams. N
2 or Ar are the most commonly used carrier gases for
experimental purposes. Liquid products are attained by condens-
ing the products in a bath of ice water, cold water, or salted ice
for lower temperature, or in dry-ice/ethanol bath at −55 °C, or a
cooled  ethylene  glycol  bath  at  −10  °C.  Yield  of  liquid  and  solid
are usually obtained by experiment, while the gases are calculated
by difference or gas analysis. Four selected fixed-bed reactors from
Table 5 for co-pyrolysis are shown in Fig. 20 (a) −(d).

4.2.2. Fluidized bed reactor for co-pyrolysis

Fluidized bed reactors provide high heating rate and improved
mixing of the feedstock. Therefore, fluidized bed reactors are more
frequently  utilized  for  insights  into  temperature  and  residence
time effects on the pyrolysis behavior of feedstock and products
formation  during  fast  pyrolysis  with  continuous  feed  [188] .  As
higher  temperatures  support  plastic  depolymerization  over  short
reaction time, co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastic, such as HDPE
need be operated over a temperature range higher than the opti-
mal conditions of biomass pyrolysis in fluidized-bed reactors [134] .
A fluidized-bed reactor system is usually composed of a feeding
section,  reactor  section,  temperature  control  section,  gas  supply
section, and gas analysis section. The bed temperature distribution
can  vary  between  room  temperature  to  900  °C  [189] .  There  are
many reviews on pyrolysis of biomass using fluidized-bed reactors
[ 190 , 191 ]. However, to the best of authors’ knowledge, only limited
studies are available on co-pyrolysis of plastic and solid biomass
based on these reactors [ 91 , 134 , 160 ].

Zhang  et  al.  [91]  investigated  catalytic  co-pyrolysis  of  black-
liquor lignin with various plastics in a fluidized bed reactor. The
fluidized bed reactor was designed to handle 5–200 g/h feedstocks
with 32 mm ID and 280 mm free board height. Feedstocks were
separately fed into the reactor by feed screw feeders. Nitrogen at
a rate of 250 mL/min was introduced into the reactor as the flu-
2  to maintain an inert
idizing gas. The hopper was swept with N
environment  in  the  feeding  unit.  A  cyclone  was  incorporated  to
remove and collect solid residues and other particles. The vapors
were introduced into ice and dry ice condensers following the cy-
clone, see Fig. 21 . Selectivity of different products were obtained
from co-pyrolysis of lignin with different plastics. More benzene,
naphthalene and its derivatives were produced by lignin and PE.
More mono-aromatics (mainly styrene) were produced from lignin
and PS. The most propylene was attained from lignin and PP [91] .
Xue et al. [134] conducted the co-pyrolysis of red oak and HDPE
using a laboratory-scale continuously-fed fluidized bed reactor at

temperature between 525 to 675 °C. The effects of pyrolysis tem-
perature  and  ratio  of  biomass  to  HDPE  on  products  of  oil,  non-
condensable gases and char were analyzed to reveal that increase
in  pyrolysis  temperature  up  to  625  °C  promoted  oil  production.
Oil from co-pyrolysis had a higher heating value up to 36.6 MJ/kg.
HDPE increased the production of furan, acids and water from red
oak [134] . Van Nguyen et al. [160] also studied the co-pyrolysis of
PS and pine sawdust in a fluidized bed reactor, see Fig. 22 . The wa-
ter content, and acetic acid concentration of bio-crude oil from co-
pyrolysis of the mixture feedstock were proportionally decreased
with increase in PS fraction in the mixture [160] .

4.2.3. Microwave for co-pyrolysis

Electric heating and microwave heating are mainly two heat-
ing techniques used in this category to study co-pyrolysis of plas-

tic and solid biomass. Microwave-assisted pyrolysis technology is
among the most promising methods for improved chemical reac-
tions due to effective heat transfer via microwave irradiation. Com-
pared to traditional heating, microwave heating converts electro-
magnetic field into heat energy at the molecular level through di-
rect transformation induced heating to generate heat within the
feedstock sample [192] . Microwave-assisted pyrolysis properties of
fast  heating  with  low  temperatures  and  energy  input  were  re-
ported [193] . Other advantages of microwave pyrolysis is high en-
ergy efficiency due to no size reduction and drying, mild reaction
condition, and higher quality of products produced [194] . The ap-
plied electromagnetic waves to interact with matters is also vol-
umetric  and  instantaneous  [195] .  Reactor  material  of  microwave
could  be  made  of  quartz  or  glass  while  the  most  common  fre-

Feedstock can be instantaneously heated to the desired temper-
ature, with more energy efficiency and minimized secondary re-
actions than conventional heating [195] . At low microwave power
levels solid waste can be pyrolyzed to produce characteristically 50
wt.% liquid, 40 wt.% solid, and 10 wt.% gas, and that the 2nd stage
gasification seldom occurs. However, at high microwave power lev-
els, the intermediate solid would undergo gasification to produce
more gas phase species. At higher power level of microwave, about
half the intermediate solid can be converted into gases, so that dis-
tribution of final yields for liquid, solid and gas were 50 wt.%, 20
wt.% and 30 wt.%, respectively, see Fig. 23 . Further gasification of
solid residues should be difficult when the solid yield is close to
the sum of fixed carbon and ash contents of the solid waste [198] .
During microwave co-pyrolysis of microalgae (MA) and PVC (see
Fig. 24 (a)), for power rise from 800 W to 10 0 0 W, the pyrolysis oil
yields increased significantly while the proportion of aromatics and
the heating value of oil and char decreased. A remarkable syner-
gistic effect between biomass and PVC were achieved in terms of
oil yield when biomass to PVC ratios were 5:5 and 3:7 at 800 W
and 5:5 at 10 0 0 W, respectively. With the increase of PVC amounts,
the content of nitrogenous and oxygenate organic matter in oil de-
creased from 29.65% to 0.38% at 800 W [195] .

Although synergistic effect with increase in oil yield were found
in microwave co-pyrolysis of plastic and solid biomass, high qual-
ity pyrolysis oil products could not be efficiently produced along
with selectivity for valued products without catalysts [199] . Cat-
alytic microwave co-pyrolysis of LDPE and cellulose can produce

solid  products  could  be  attained  directly  while  gas  products  are
usually calculated by difference. Characteristics of microwave for
co-pyrolysis of plastic and solid biomass are reported in Table 6 .

jet  fuel  range  alkanes.  The  overall  carbon  yield,  with  mixtures
of hydrogenated organics close to jet fuels, was enhanced to 39%
along with ∼90% selectivity for jet-fuel range alkanes. The positive
synergy between cellulose and LDPE from the co-pyrolysis using
catalysts in microwave pyrolysis significantly improved the carbon
yield of raw organics and suppressed solid residue formation [193] .
Co-pyrolysis  temperature  and  catalytic  pyrolysis  temperature
could be controlled separately for improved production and char-
acteristics  of  pyrolysis  oil.  Due  to  the  problems  of  catalyst  in-
activation in microwave co-pyrolysis, ex-situ catalytic microwave-
assisted co-pyrolysis was studied using PP and bamboo with the
catalyst  installed  downstream  of  the  material  rather  than  mix-
ing  with  the  feedstock  material,  see  Fig.  24 (b)  [150] .  Microwave
co-pyrolysis of lignin and LDPE provided lignin-based char [194] .
HZSM-5 and MgO [197] as catalysts provided improved quality and
yield of pyrolysis oil. The highest quantity (19.97 wt.%) and quality
of pyrolysis oil (hydrocarbon more than 30 wt.%) were obtained at
450 °C along with syngas that had H
4 of about 40%,
20%  and  6%,  respectively  [194] .  Effects  of  pyrolysis  temperature,
lignin to LDPE ratio, MgO to HZSM-5 ratio, and feedstock (LDPE
and lignin) to catalyst ratio on the pyrolysis oil yield were inves-
tigated and optimal conditions were obtained when temperature
was 500 °C, lignin to LDPE ratio was 3:1, and feedstock to catalyst
ratio was 1:1 [197] .

In contrast to waste plastic, solid biomass usually contains more
moisture, see Table 2 and Table 3 . Torrefied solid biomass was used
as the raw materials in microwave co-pyrolysis to attain high qual-
ity pyrolysis oil due to removal of more moisture. Hydrocarbons
and  aromatic  hydrocarbons  were  dramatically  increased  to  83.9
wt.% and 22.8 wt.%, respectively by using microwave co-pyrolysis
of torrefied lignin with LDPE, while the phenols decreased signif-
icantly [192] . Biomass torrefied via microwave heating enhanced
the quality of pyrolysis oil and this may due to some volatile mat-
ter released during the baking process, which resulted in the re-
duction of final pyrolysis oil yield. The pyrolysis oil obtained from
co-pyrolysis  of  microwave  torrefied  biomass  with  waste  plastics
had higher quality pyrolysis oil than that of original biomass and
plastics [60] .

4.2.4. Multi-step reactors for co-pyrolysis

To improve the co-pyrolysis performance associated with fixed
bed, fluidized bed and microwave, a second reactor could be added
to the existing reactor for further cracking of products from the
first stage reactor. This allowed the production of more gases or
liquids at high efficiency.

Continuous pyrolysis-reforming of pine sawdust and HDPE were
conducted in a two-stage reaction system using a conical spouted
bed reactor and a fluidized bed reactor [72] . The unit was provided
with two independent feeders for biomass and HDPE to avoid the
segregation observed when both materials were mixed in a single
feeder. In addition, steam condensation in the vessel was avoided

by  feeding  a  small  flow  of  N
2  from  the  top  of  the  feeding  sys-
tem.  Fig.  25  shows  a  spouted  bed  reactor  used  for  co-pyrolysis
and a fluidized bed that was used for the subsequent reforming of
pyrolysis volatiles. Compared with gasification, improved H
2 yield
was  achieved  using  the  two-step  pyrolysis  and  reforming  along
with the benefits of lower temperatures required in co-pyrolysis
of biomass and plastic mixtures [72] .

A two-step catalytic co-pyrolysis (TSCCP) process was investi-
gated while considering advantages of conventional two-step cat-
alytic pyrolysis (TSCP) and one-step catalytic co-pyrolysis (OSCCP)
to produce aromatic-rich oil, see Fig. 26 (a). The yield and quality
of pyrolytic oil obtained from TSCCP were highest. This was due to
advantages of avoiding secondary reactions of hemicellulose and
cellulose and existence on the activation effect of lignin (hydrogen
transfer from LDPE to lignin) in TSCP process in addition to Diels-
Alder  reaction  and  H-transfer  between  solid  biomass  oxygenates
and LDPE hydrocarbons in OSCCP process, see Fig. 26 (b) [84] .

pyrolysis  with  hydropyrolysis  with  the  aim  to  improve  liquids
quality  produced  in  the  presence  of  hydrogen  in  the  reaction
medium. Co-pyrolysis followed by hydropyrolysis was not a good
option,  besides  the  higher  complexity  of  the  two  steps  process.
Solids  conversion  did  not  improve,  while  the  gaseous  yield  in-
creased much at the expenses of decreased liquid yield. The best
option seems to be co-hydropyrolysis, as higher conversions and
higher  gas  and  liquid  yields  were  obtained.  Liquids  were  richer
in  lighter  alkanes  and  in  aromatic  compounds.  However,  as  this

process has higher operating costs, its economic viability depends
on the economic value of the products obtained.

5.1. Co-pyrolysis with ZSM-5 based catalyst

5. Catalytic co-pyrolysis

Thermal degradation of plastic and solid biomass without cat-
alyst  has  a  drawback  of  non-selective  products  and  requirement
of high temperatures. Catalysts can provide an alternative lower-
energy  pathway  for  selective  product  yield.  Several  comparative
thermal and catalytic studies on co-pyrolysis of plastic and solid
biomass revealed that products yield, and composition were very
different. The relative amount of heteroatom containing molecules
and energy input for pyrolysis were reduced to enhance the quality
of pyrolysis oil [200] . In addition it accelerated the pyrolysis reac-
tion at lower temperatures [149] . Yield of aromatics significantly
improved  along  with  coke  reduction  [44] .  The  activation  energy
values were slightly lowered when catalyst was added in plastic
waste  and  solid  biomass  mixtures  compared  to  no  catalyst  case
[68] . Catalytic co-pyrolysis (CCP) of plastic and solid biomass can
be developed in two different ways of in-situ and ex-situ cataly-
sis. In in-situ system, the catalyst is mixed with the feedstock and
placed in the same pyrolysis reactor, while in the ex-situ system,
catalyst is separated from the feedstock into a separate reactor, lo-
cated downstream of pyrolysis reactor [93] .

The role of plastic to biomass ratio, catalyst, feedstock to cata-
lyst ratio, reaction temperature and co-pyrolysis method are very
important in CCP of plastic and solid biomass. The main charac-
teristics of catalytic co-pyrolysis of waste plastic and solid biomass
are summarized in Table 7 .

Natural  zeolites  consists  of  mainly  silicon  dioxide  along  with
aluminum  oxide,  ferric  oxide,  magnesium  oxide,  calcium  oxide,
potassium oxide, sodium oxide, titanium dioxide, along with the
remaining trace oxides [215] . Zeolite based catalysts are most com-
mon catalysts used in studies on co-pyrolysis of plastic and solid
biomass.  Zeolites  are  three-dimensional  solids  with  a  selective
porous  structure  known  for  their  efficient  cracking  of  large  hy-
drocarbons and dehydration reactions, leading to branched, cyclic,
or small aromatic molecules. The structure and pore size of zeo-
lite catalysts allow them to function as a sieve and also to have
a  dimensional  selectivity  towards  specific  molecules.  ZSM-5  is  a
medium pore size from zeolites ( ∼0.52nm) and is the most effi-
cient catalyst amongst all the zeolites [216] . ZSM-5 possesses high
thermal stability among zeolites, and can withstand over 1100 °C
temperature without any structural change from rearrangement of
the molecules [217] .

Catalytic co-pyrolysis (CCP) could have a lower activation en-
ergy  than  non-catalytic  co-pyrolysis,  because  the  ZSM-5  catalyst
can effectively accelerate the deoxygenation and dehydration re-
actions  [85] .  Fig.  27  shows  that  the  decomposition  of  LDPE  or
biomass resulted in single peaks at 470 and 360 °C, respectively.
However, the curves contained two peaks with their mixtures. The
high-temperature peak lowered to a lower temperature in presence
of ZSM-5 catalyst, which is lower than that from the mixture of
biomass and LDPE. The results indicated that ZSM-5 can decrease
the decomposition temperature, but the activation energy loss was
not apparent due to  the  surface coking  that caused  in deactiva-
tion of the catalyst [85] . Similar results were shown in thermal de-

HZSM-5 produced the
largest amount of BTEXs
during the CCP of PET
and yellow poplar wood
followed by H β and HY.

Promoted aromatic
hydrocarbons formation,
suppressed poly-aromatic
hydrocarbon, and
oxygenates in liquid
yield. Decreased
oxygenated compounds
and increased
mono-aromatic
hydrocarbon formation
over dual-catalyst bed
was attributed to initial
conversion of heavier
compounds to lighter
ones by CaO/MgO.
Cyclization,
aromatization, hydrogen
transfer and
vapor-catalytic reforming
reactions could be
enhanced during CCP of
LDPE and pubescens. H 2
production was promoted
due to the synergistic
effect between Ni and
Mo over KF-846.
The K 2 CO 3 and ZnCl 2
presence leads to the
significant dehydration of
the polysaccharides and
influences the chemical
composition of pyrolysis
oil . ZnCl 2 as catalyst was
generally much more
effective for removal of
hydroxyl and methoxy
groups than K 2 CO 3.
Aromatic formation was
dramatically enhanced
compared to calculated
values, because HZSM-5
promoted aromatization
of small oxygenates and
olefins, and sequential
Diels-Alder reaction and
dehydration.

composition behavior and kinetics of LDPE and biomass (cellulose,
Douglas fir sawdust) using catalytic co-pyrolysis over ZSM-5 cata-
lyst. These results reveals that kinetic study using CCP of biomass
and plastic as a good promising method that can realize input en-
ergy saving [218] .

Co-pyrolysis of LDPE and cellulose with ZSM-5 catalyst signif-
icantly improved the yield of valuable petrochemicals (monoaro-
matic  hydrocarbons  and  olefins),  decreased  the  yield  of  unde-
sired polyaromatics along with greatly improved product distribu-
tion [219] . For example, it provided a higher aromatic yield (47.5
wt.%)  than  individual  pyrolysis  of  cellulose  that  provided  (37.7
wt.%)  and  LDPE  that  provided  (34.3  wt.%).  The  results  provided
more valuable monoaromatics (85.1 wt.%) and less coke (11.9 wt.%)
from  co-pyrolysis,  than  pyrolysis  of  cellulose  alone,  which  pro-
vided 66.7 wt.% monoaromatics and 36.6 wt.% less coke [201] . This
catalytic  co-pyrolysis  with  LDPE  has  also  been  used  to  produce
petrochemical-like and aromatic-rich oil from agricultural wastes.
Co-feeding corn fermentation residues and LDPE enhanced petro-
chemical production for significant improvement of petrochemical
yield including the formation of benzene, toluene, xylenes, ethy-
lene, and propylene that were found to be present when LDPE was
blended with cellulose at 10–33.3 wt.% [220] .

Catalytic co-pyrolysis (CCP) with ZSM-5 can preserve sufficient
catalytic activity to produce valuable monoaromatic hydrocarbons
and  decrease  the  formation  of  polyaromatics.  CCP  of  LLDPE  and
carbohydrates (xylan, avicel, and torrefied avicel) over mesoporous
ZSM-5 demonstrated the synergistic formation of aromatic hydro-
carbons,  producing  higher  yields  of  monoaromatic  hydrocarbons
(MAHs) than the average of the individual yield of MAHs obtained
from catalytic co-pyrolysis of LLDPE and carbohydrates. This posi-
tive synergy of aromatic formation can be attributed to enhanced
Diels-Alder reaction between the intermediates of LLDPE and car-
bohydrates [221] . Moreover, ZSM-5 could be modified with other
metal ions to enhance its catalytic ability. ZSM-5 modification with
boron has been shown to improve the selectivity for more valu-
able p-xylene production over m- and o-xylenes via pore narrow-
ing of ZSM-5 by boron deposition. Co-pyrolysis of cellulose with
LDPE significantly improved the yield of valuable petrochemicals
(MAHs and olefins) while decreasing the yield of Polycyclic aro-
matic hydrocarbons (PAHs) compared with catalytic fast pyrolysis
of cellulose alone, thus greatly improving the product distribution
[219] . The yield of valuable petrochemicals (olefins and aromatic
hydrocarbons) increased from 42.9 C% for ZSM-5 to 52.8–54.1 C%
for P- and P/Ni-modified ZSM-5, while the yields of low-value alka-
nes and solid residue decreased from 17.3 C% and 22.6 C% to 9.6–
10.2 C% and 18.9–15.7 C%, respectively with the above catalyst, see
Fig. 28 . Modification with P and P/Ni considerably improved the
hydrothermal stability of zeolites to resist steam-induced catalyst
deactivation that  may  occur  in  CCP  of  plastic  and solid  biomass
[222] .

Fig. 28.  Carbon yields of major products evolved from catalytic fast co-pyrolysis of
pine wood and LDPE mixture (at mass ratio of 2) with conventional, P-, and P/Ni-
modified ZSM-5 zeolites [222] .(C% = Mole of carbon in a product / Mole of carbon in
reactant × 100%) [Copyrights 2015 reproduced with permission from Royal Society
of Chemistry].

HZSM-5  catalyst  is  synthesized  by  calcination  of  ammonium
form of ZSM-5, during which the zeolite (ZSM-5) catalyst is ex-
posed to air at 550 °C for 2 h or 500 °C for 5 h. The calcination
transforms the ZSM-5 solid into a protonic form called Hydrogen-
exchanged Zeolite catalyst Socony Mobil-5 (HZSM-5 or H + ZSM-5)
[ 93 , 216 ]. HZSM-5 provides a sustainably low rate of deactivation
and can be reused [200] , thus a widely accepted catalyst for high
yields of pyrolysis oil and hydrocarbons [216] . Amongst all the cat-
alysts  used,  HZSM-5  catalyst  was  most  attractive  due  to  its  in-
crease of the aromatic yield by selective intermediate deoxygena-
tion. Many investigations were conducted that showed existence
of positive synergy between plastic and biomass in terms of in-
creased aromatic hydrocarbon yield from catalytic pyrolysis using
HZSM-5 [ 50 , 129 , 203 , 209 , 223–225 ]. Carbon and hydrogen rich feed-
stocks can increase aromatic carbon yields with reduced coke/char
formation as contact time with the catalyst increased via the hy-
drocarbon pool mechanism [129] . The mechanism of CCP consists
of radical interactions in addition to Diels–Alder reactions. The cat-
alytic effect of HZSM-5 could promote the Diels–Alder reaction to
enhance the yield and selectivity of aromatic hydrocarbons [209] .
The proportion of oxygenates were decreased in the presence of
HZSM-5 catalyst, because more active sites could be provided for
accelerating aromatization and oligomerization reactions. Further-
more, the vapor from the co-pyrolysis of plastic and solid biomass
sufficiently accessed the HZSM-5 catalysts surface, to subsequently
reduce the oxygenates and increase the hydrocarbons [149] .

Fig. 29.  Reaction pathways for catalytic co-pyrolysis of biomass components and PE: (1) Diels–Alder reaction mechanism; (2) hydrocarbon pool mechanism; (3) hydrogen
transfer between PE and lignin [208] . [Copyrights 2016 reproduced with permission from Elsevier Science].

Xue  et  al.  investigated  CCP  of  biomass  (components  and  PE
in  the  presence  of  HZSM-5.  Their  results  showed  that  yields
of  aromatic  hydrocarbons  were  enhanced  due  to  Diels-Alder  re-
action  between  hemicellulose/cellulose-derived  furans  and  PE-
derived  olefins.  Lignin-derived  phenolic  compounds  were  larger
than HZSM-5 micropores, which led them to get adsorbed onto the
catalyst surface forming coke that subsequently reduced the cata-
lyst activity. However, H-transfer from plastic could promote im-
prove cracking conditions for these surficial phenolic compounds.
The catalytic interaction among co-pyrolysis is favored through a
combination of Diels–Alder reaction, hydrocarbon pool mechanism,
and hydrogen transfer. Fig. 29 shows the reaction mechanisms be-
tween biomass components and PE over HZSM-5 catalyst [208] .

During  HZSM-5  zeolite  co-pyrolysis,  acid-infused  corn  stover
and PE also produced highest yield of aromatic hydrocarbon and
lowest yield of solid residue compared to non-catalytic co-pyrolysis
from the accelerated Diels-Alder reaction. In addition to the Diels-
Alder  reaction,  hydrogen  donation  by  plastic  also  contributed  to
synergistic effects. The hydrogen atoms can stabilize reactive rad-
ical intermediates to prevent the formation of char and coke pre-
cursors. The PE-derived hydrogen atoms can also reduce adsorp-
tion of phenolics on the catalyst surface and possibly hydrocrack
the  large  phenolics  into  smaller  molecules.  The  side  chain  frag-
ments  of  the  phenolics  then  can  enter  HZSM-5  pores  to  deoxy-
genate to aromatics [203] . The pyrolysis of PE over HZSM-5 pro-
duced  ethylene  and  propylene  and  their  amounts  increased  at
higher temperatures. Ethylene and propylene can also be produced
from the cellulose pyrolysis as well as furans over HZSM-5, which
show an increased selectivity for olefin production. The presence of
plastic enhanced the production of biogenic ethylene and propy-
lene  when  these  plastics  are  co-pyrolyzed  with  cellulose  in  the
presence  of  HZSM-5.  The  formation  of  mixed  ethylene  is  possi-
ble through the oligomerization/aromatization of the primary co-
pyrolysis products followed by re-cracking of these larger olefins
and aromatics which then re-enter the hydrocarbon pool [129] . It
was proposed that the aromatization was favored mainly by strong
acid sites in catalyst HZSM-5 based on the catalytic reforming of
the pyrolytic derivatives from the co-pyrolysis of pubescents and
LDPE over HZSM-5 and desilicated zeolite ZSM-5 (DeZSM-5) as re-
ported  by  Liu  et  al.  [225] .  HZSM-5  exhibited  high  aromatization
activity  in  the  CCP  of  pubescents  and  LDPE,  whereas  DeZSM-5
(desilicated zeolite ZSM-5) exhibited high alkylation activity. The
total  relative  content  of  phenolic  compounds  in  aqueous  prod-
ucts  obtained  by  CCP  of  pubescents  and  LDPE  by  both  HZSM-5
and DeZSM-5 was high (60–65%) compared to normal thermal co-

pyrolysis (27%). The aromatization was favored mainly by strong
acid sites in catalyst HZSM-5 while the alkylation was favored by
weak acid sites in catalyst ZSM-5. DeZSM-5 showed a decrease of
hydrogen content in gas mixture that correlated with the relative
high content of alkane in resulting oil. The higher hydrogen con-
tent in gas mixture over fresh HZSM-5 corresponded to the high
content of aromatics in the oil produced.

The coke formation in CCP resulted in catalyst deactivation as
reported  by  Mullen  et  al.  on  the  effect  of  ex-situ  CCP  in  HDPE
and switchgrass on the deactivation and coke formation on HZSM-
5 [204] . The presence of olefins produced from the CCP of HDPE
reacts with furanics from switchgrass to yield aromatic hydrocar-
bons  and  lower  coke  formation  that  caused  deactivation  of  the
catalyst. This deactivation of catalyst was more rapid in the case
of  biomass  addition.  However,  catalyst  deactivation  due  to  cok-
ing  was  reduced  by  the  addition  of  PE  or  increase  of  cumula-
tive  feed  to  biomass  ratio.  Production  of  aromatic  hydrocarbons
was higher from the mixture compared than switchgrass or HDPE
alone at any catalyst exposure level. The effect of reaction temper-
ature and feedstock to catalyst ratio and the hindering influence of
biomass on HZSM-5 catalytic pyrolysis of plastic waste was studied
by Sebestyén et al. [226] . Their results revealed that mixing with
15% cellulose only hinders the sample. However, 50% cellulose or
10%  lignin  were  found  to  block  the  catalytic  activity  of  HZSM-5
on hydrocarbon polymers at slow heating rate. The HZSM-5 was
hindered by the biomass resulting in lower yield of aromatic prod-
ucts at 550 °C at a catalyst to feedstock ratio of 1:10. However,
HZSM-5 catalyst favored high amounts of aromatics at the same
temperature when ratio of catalyst to feedstock was 1:1. Sebestyén
et al. [200] reported that hindering effect of biomass can be al-
leviated using higher amounts of  catalyst  present. HZSM-5 cata-
lyst could significantly increase the yields of condensable and non-
condensable volatiles. The aromatic compounds produced were re-
duced by CCP of plastic and biomass compared to that of plastic
pyrolysis which indicated loss of HZSM-5 catalyst activity due to
cellulose and lignin.

idation  states,  to  form  co-ordinate  complexes  with  the  reagents,
and  electron  supplying  capability  make  the  transition  metals  as
good  catalysts.  Transition  metals  have  been  used  as  a  high-
efficiency and low-cost solution in catalytic pyrolysis of biomass

rials [227] .

tio. HZSM-5 improved the production of aromatics while MgO pro-
moted alkylation of phenols [197] .

Transition  metals  such  as  Ni,  Co,  Fe  and  Mn  are  necessary
minerals  for  the  growth  of  plants  making  them  widely  exist  in
biomass.  When  the  transition  metal-containing  biomass  gets  co-
pyrolyzed  with  other  solid  wastes,  they  influence  the  process
[228] . Wang et al. used transition metals (Ni, Co, Fe or Mn) to in-
vestigate co-pyrolysis of PE and lignin [228] and also cellulose and
PE [229] . For co-pyrolysis of lignin and PE, the onset of decom-
position temperature for lignin and PE mixture were decreased by
10–53 °C and 9–18 °C, respectively and the activation energy of
lignin and PE in the mixture was reduced by 66-22 kJ/mol and 8-
50 kJ/mol, respectively [228] . During co-pyrolysis of cellulose and
PE, the onset temperature of decomposition of cellulose and PE in
the mixture were reduced by 91–136 °C and 8–15 °C, respectively
and the activation energy value of cellulose and PE in the mixture
was reduced by 53–80 kJ/mol and 8–12 kJ/mol, respectively [229] .

Alkali/alkaline  earth  metals  (AAEMs)  showed  different  effects
on the decomposition characteristics of plastic and solid biomass
mixtures  during  CCP.  During  cellulose/HDPE  co-pyrolysis  with
AAEMs (Na, K, Ca, Mg) present in char as a base catalyst, the pres-
ence of AAEMs favored the ring cracking and dehydration reactions
of  cellulose  to  produce  furans  and  ketones.  Na  showed  stronger
catalytic  cracking  effect  to  promote  alkenes  formation  compared
to  that  of  K,  Ca,  and  Mg,  and  that  AAEMs  in  cellulose-derived
char catalyst promoted cracking of HDPE to produce alkenes [108] .
MgO catalysts as alkali earth metal compounds can be extracted
from  magnesite  mineral  after  calcination,  crushing  and  sieving.
These  catalysts  competitively  reduce  oxygen  content  in  the  pro-
duced pyrolysis oil [230] . MgO supported on carbon (MgO/C) ex-
hibited strongest positive synergy for the production of aromatic
hydrocarbons  during  co-pyrolysis  of  LLDPE  and  lignin.  These  re-
sults suggest that a metal oxide with base properties supported on
high-surface-area carbon offers an efficient catalyst to produce py-
rolysis oil of high energy density (to serve as fuel additives) from
lignin [110] . In addition to MgO, MgCO
3 also favored co-pyrolysis
of biomass and plastic to produce high-quality oil. Co-pyrolysis of
rice husk and PVC in the presence of MgO or MgCO
3 at 600 °C im-
proved the oils quality with decreased acid content and increased
hydrocarbon content. Particularly, the resulting oils had high hy-
drocarbon content ( > 35%) and low acid content ( < 2%) [231] .

Although several different studies have been conducted on the
co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastic over zeolite or transition metal-
based catalysts, the short lifetime of the zeolite catalyst and the
formation of coke during the process continue to remain a great
challenge. The combination of HZSM-5 catalysts with other cata-
lysts offers a novel way to overcome these shortcomings [130] . A
3 catalyst was shown
2 CO
combination of HZSM-5 and Na
to  be  more  effective  than  HZSM-5  only  for  hydrocarbons  pro-
duction,  and  also  for  18%  more  oxygen  removal  than  HZSM-5
alone.  The  optimization  studies  of  ex-situ  co-pyrolysis  indicated
that maximum yield of aromatic compounds were obtained at 700
3 ratio
°C, biomass: PET ratio of 4, and HZSM-5 to Na
of 5 [130] . CeO
2 was effective in deoxygenating from acids, alde-
hydes and methoxy phenols while HZSM-5 strongly promoted the
conversion of oxygenates to aromatics and alkenes. So, co-catalysis
over CeO
2 and HZSM-5 in tandem is expected to provide the ad-
2 and HZSM-5 enhanced hydrocar-
vantages of both catalysts. CeO
bon yield to utmost 85% and highest selectivity of monocyclic aro-
matics  of  73%  with  co-pyrolysis  of  corn  stover  and  LDPE  [224] .
Similar investigation was also conducted on CCP of lignin and LDPE
with HZSM-5 and MgO wherein the aromatics increased while the
alkylated phenols decreased with increase in HZSM-5 to MgO ra-

Catalytic co-pyrolysis of plastic (LLDPE) and solid biomass (xy-
lan) in the dual-catalyst bed of CaO and HZSM-5 showed excellent
performance to improve hydrocarbon yield as acids were first de-
oxygenated to ketones by CaO, followed by aromatization of ke-
tones over HZSM-5. Furthermore, LLDPE-derived alkenes enhanced
the  production  of  hydrocarbons  by  engaging  in  both  the  Diels-
Alder reactions and the hydrocarbon pool reactions. The yield of
aromatics was increased from about 27 wt.% without HZSM-5 to 40
wt.% with HZSM-5 [109] . For co-pyrolysis of corn stover and scum
(floatable  solids  skimmed  off from  the  surface  of  sedimentation
process in wastewater treatment plants containing plastics and or-
ganic materials) using the catalyst (CaO and HZSM-5), the conver-
sion of feedstock to aromatics enhanced to 35.8 wt.% when dual-
catalyst of CaO to HZSM-5 ratio was 1:4 [232] . Dual CCP of LLDPE
and  bamboo  sawdust  with  CeO
3  and  HZSM-5  improved
2 O
aromatics  and  provided  maximum  products  with  CeO
3
to HZSM-5 mass ratio of 1:3. In the case of naphthalene and its
derivates (NIDs), it decreased with the increase in CeO
3 to
HZSM-5 mass ratio. The relative selectivity for NIDs was decreased
3  to HZSM-5 mass
from 13.8 wt.% to 5.6 wt.% when CeO
ratio increased from 1:3 to 3:1. These results conclude that dual
CCP could not only enhance the formation of monocyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons but also inhibit NIDs production, see Fig. 30 [207] .

A study on the co-pyrolysis with multi-catalyst showed that the
arrangement of HDPE/HZSM-5/glucose/HZSM-5 had favorable ad-
vantages on pyrolysis oil yield and aromatics selectivity, see Fig. 31 .
The highest oil yield of 20.6 wt.% and aromatics selectivity of 95.9%
were achieved for pyrolysis temperature, biomass to HDPE ratio,
and feedstock to catalyst ratio of 600 °C, 1:2, and 1:1, respectively
[187] .

Several  studies  are  reported  on  comparison  of  HZSM-5  and
other  catalysts  to  determine  their  different  functions.  Compared
to Al-SBA-15 (Highly ordered hexagonal mesoporous silica struc-
tures with aluminum), mesoporous ZSM-5 (called MZSM-5) pro-
duced  increased  mono-aromatic  hydrocarbons  (MAHs)  owing  to
the presence of both micropores and mesopores, which foster the
shape  selectivity  for  aromatic  formation  and  enhanced  diffusion
of  large  molecular  pyrolyzates,  as  well  as  its  strong  acidity.  For
both  Al-SBA-15  and  MZSM-5,  the  amount  of  mono-aromatic  hy-
drocarbons increased via CCP of biomass carbohydrates and LLDPE
from the positive synergy on the formation of aromatics during co-
pyrolysis [221] . Compared to H-Beta catalyst, yield of aromatic hy-
drocarbons obtained over HZSM-5 was considerably higher in co-
pyrolysis of torrefaction of cellulose and PP, because of the critical
pore size and shape selectivity of HZSM-5 to produce more aro-
matic hydrocarbons during co-pyrolysis [151] . Kim et al. [74] inves-
tigated the CCP of torrefied yellow poplar and HDPE in the pres-
ence of microporous HZSM-5 and mesoporous Al-MCM-41. The cat-
alytic properties of Al-MCM-41 were tuned by pore enlargement
[233] . The experimental yields of aromatics from CCP of torrefied
yellow poplar and HDPE were higher than their weighted aggre-
gate yields [233] . HZSM-5 also exhibited higher activity than Al-
MCM-41 for aromatic production from CCP due to its strong acidity
and favorable pore structure. The CCP of Quercus variabilis (Chi-
nese cork oak) and plastic in Py-GC/MS resulted in additional aro-
matics formation suggesting that the interaction between pyrolytic
intermediates  of  Quercus  variabilis  and  waste  plastic  over  both
3 ratio = 23) led
HY (SiO
to  the  enhanced  formation  of  aromatics.  The  CCP  over  HZSM-5
showed higher aromatic and lower coke formation efficiency than
that  over  HY  due  to  higher  acidity  and  better  pore  structure  of
HZSM-5  [234] .  Physicochemical  properties  of  catalysts  of  meso-
porous ZSM-5, HZSM-5, Al-SBA-15, Al-MCM-41 and HY are given

product yield (39%) followed by Zn-ZSM-5 (38%), Fe-ZSM-5 (38%)
and Ni-ZSM-5 (36%), see Fig. 32 . Fe-ZSM-5 was shown to be the
most effective deoxygenating catalyst (97.4%) and provided maxi-
mum monoaromatic hydrocarbons content (83.3%) in the organic
liquid products. Xiang et al. [235] investigated Co-ZSM-5 catalyst
effect on thermal behavior and kinetics for co-pyrolysis of LLDPE
and rice straw. The pyrolysis activation energy of rice straw, LLDPE,
catalytic co-pyrolysis of LLDPE and rice straw were 79.6, 212.2 and
41.0 kJ/mol, respectively, suggesting a positive synergistic interac-
tion  in  co-pyrolysis.  Addition  of  LLDPE  to  lignin  in  catalytic  co-
pyrolysis provided a lower apparent activation energy (25.4 kJ/mol)
compared to raw lignin pyrolysis (31.2 kJ/mol).

Bio-based  and  by-product-based  catalyst  materials  have  been
the subject of recent investigations. One of the principal directives

ence of transition metal (Co, Ni, Zn, and Fe) doped with HZSM-5.
The results showed that Co-ZSM-5 produced highest organic liquid

for the use of these catalyst were for cost-effective production of
the desired compounds. Lignin-based char modification using zinc
transition metal showed to be beneficial by improving the porosity
and selectivity of the prepared catalyst in co-pyrolysis of LDPE and
lignin [194] . Activated carbon (AC) from corncob and sulfonation
of activated carbon (SAC) were investigated as catalysts in CCP of
LDPE and Douglas fir to produce bio-jet fuels by Mateo et al. [236] .
Results showed that the introduction of SO
3 H to the SAC catalysts
provided significantly improved quality of pyrolysis oil compared
to using AC catalyst alone. SAC is a promising catalyst for the co-
pyrolysis of biomass and plastic to produce hydrocarbons suitable
for the jet-fuel range. The increase in acidity of SAC catalysts con-
tributed  by  the  introduction  of  -SO
3 H  group  promoted  catalytic
cracking,  hydrogenation  and  aromatization  reactions  to  produce
alkane and aromatic hydrocarbons. The highest yield of bio-jet fu-
els (aromatics and C
9-16  alkanes) in pyrolysis oil was 97.5% from
SAC catalyst. Hassan et al. [101] used faujasite-type zeolite derived
from electric arc furnace slag (EAFS) which consists of 22.25 wt.%
3 ,  28.25 wt.%  CaO  to  investi-
SiO
gate CCP of HDPE and sugarcane bagasse. Their results showed that
this multi-catalyst with strong acidic sites eased the diffusion of a
wide range of molecular sizes into the catalyst pore and enhanced
the cracking and deoxygenation of oxygenates to hydrocarbon. The
maximum pyrolysis oil yield reached 68.56 wt.%, and the pyrolysis
oil contained mainly hydrocarbons (74.55%) with minimal amounts
of oxygenated compounds. Gandidi et al. [215] used natural acti-
vated zeolite as a catalyst to improve the production of pyrolysis
oil from CCP of real MSW (consisting of 52 wt.% waste plastic, 43
wt.% solid biomass, 3 wt.% rubber, 2 wt.% textile). The presence of
activated zeolite in the pyrolysis process improved the secondary
cracking into small hydrocarbon chains, and this provided remark-
able increases in bio-crude oil yield by around 40.8 % compared
to non-catalytic co-pyrolysis. Thermal and catalytic pyrolysis pro-
duced pyrolysis oil had properties close to gasoline and diesel, be-
ing around 15.2 wt.% and 21.4 wt.%, respectively.

5.4. Co-pyrolysis with ex-situ catalyst

In-situ Catalytic co-pyrolysis (CCP) offers lower capital cost and
higher efficiency than ex-situ but, in-situ catalysis has many disad-
vantages that have resulted in preventing its commercial success.
These  disadvantages  arise  from  the  harsh  environment  provided
during  pyrolysis,  which  results  in  these  catalysts  being  prone  to

36

deactivation by char, coke and impurities present in products from
co-pyrolysis, and that coke production causes deactivation of cat-
alyst due to the blocking of catalyst channels [237] . Production of
aromatic hydrocarbons are significantly decreased with the catalyst
deactivation and this leads to difficulty in regenerating the cata-
lysts after completing the in-situ pyrolysis reactions. This results
in the need for unsustainable amounts of high value catalysts or
their regeneration and this leads to high operating costs making
such application less attractive [ 150 , 238 ]. Ex-situ catalyst can avoid
this with separate temperature control for catalytic co-pyrolysis as
another factor to make this mode more flexible [211] . The key is to
separate out the steps of pyrolysis and catalytic reforming process
[150] .

Ex-situ Catalytic co-pyrolysis (CCP) of empty fruit bunches/PP
(using mass ratios of 75/25, 50/50, and 25/75) resulted in lower
formation of aromatic hydrocarbons than that of in-situ at 600 °C
[237] . Compared to ex-situ CCP, the in-situ CCP of torrefied yel-
low poplar and HDPE produced higher amounts of aromatic hy-
drocarbons due to improved contact between vapors evolved from
pyrolysis and their interaction with the catalyst [ 74 , 239 ]. However,
compared with no catalyst, production of aromatic compounds still
increased from co-pyrolysis of sugarcane bagasse with PET using
an ex-situ catalyst, especially BTEXs and minimized the formation
of coke [130] . Additionally, ex-situ CCP enhanced the gas yield and
decreased the oil yield as compared to in-situ CCP, for same cata-
lyst to feedstock ratio and temperature, see Fig. 33 [93] .

6. Co-pyrolysis for different products

In co-pyrolysis systems, the operating conditions are controlled
with  focus  on  increasing  one  of  the  pyrolytic  products,  such  as
solid, liquid or gas products [123] . However, in the case of waste
plastic and solid biomass, the conversion to gaseous and liquid fuel
is more meaningful for waste management and energy recovery.
Furthermore, solid residues remaining can be improved to make
them valuable by-products.

6.1. Liquid products

Production of liquids from solid wastes is an important pathway
to meet fuel and energy needs and resolve environmental issues
associated with the management of wastes.

6.1.1. Fuels in liquid

High hydrogen content, especially from HDPE, LDPE, PP and PS,
can  provide  H-transfer  during  co-pyrolysis  with  woody  biomass
and  provided  increased  liquid  yield  [ 69 , 83 , 157 , 185 ].  Addition  of
PET also offers to create higher oil yields [123] . However, PVC did
not result in increased liquid yields [ 123 , 161 ], but the addition of
PVC to biomass increased the yield of gas phase products [123] .
The synergistic effects that occurs during co-pyrolysis of cellulose
and  plastic  is  a  combination  of  different  mechanisms  leading  to
increased liquid yield. The char produced can act as a catalyst dur-
ing devolatilization while the presence of cellulosic oil and aque-
ous phase enhanced the formation of liquid from LDPE during con-
densation [83] . Positive synergistic effects can occur not only for
liquid yield but also for heating value of the liquid. Maximum liq-
uid  yield  achieved  were  over  60%  at  temperature  of  40 0–60 0 °C
[ 69 , 83 , 152 , 157 , 160 ]. The HHV of pyrolysis oil, from co-pyrolysis of
50:50 pine sawdust /PS mixtures, was almost twice compared to
that from pine sawdust alone. The pyrolysis oil of PS had HHV of
41.7 MJ/kg. The calculated HHV from linear interpolation showed
the synergistic effect from the increase in heating value using 30
wt.% PS and remaining being biomass [160] . The hydrocarbon con-
tent or H/C ratio, and oxygen content provide a significant role in
controlling the calorific value of oil. The improvement in calorific
value of 1:1 blend can be explained by the increase in H/C ratio
from 1.25 to 1.47 due to addition of LDPE. On the other hand, the
significant decrease in oxygen from 26.2% to 15.5% also contributed
to  the  increase  in  heating  value  of  the  co-pyrolysis  liquid  [146] .
Heating value of liquid fuel produced were 40 MJ/kg which is close
to gasoline or diesel fuels [ 152 , 157 , 160 , 161 , 185 ]. The physical prop-
erties from co-pyrolysis of PP and rice bran wax pyrolytic oil were
close to diesel in terms of density, specific gravity, flash point, fire
point and heating value [152] . Reported liquid products yield and
heating value from co-pyrolysis of waste plastic and solid biomass
are presented in Table 9 .

Positive  synergistic  effects  from  co-pyrolysis  of  plastic  and
biomass provided lower water and oxygen content and thus low-
ering total acid number, density, and viscosity. Higher pH, calorific
value and carbon density in co-pyrolysis oil in comparison to cal-
culated data, showed decrease in viscosity and total acid number
by 76 % and 216 %, see Fig. 34 [69] . Co-pyrolysis derived oils con-
tained remarkably lower water amounts due to the natural phase
separation and radical interaction during co-pyrolysis, leaving be-

hind  lower  amounts  of  water.  The  increased  calorific  values  are
related to low water content and oxygen density in co-pyrolysis
oil. The experimental values of viscosity obtained from co-pyrolysis
oil were significantly lower than that of calculated (or theoretical)
data and they gradually decreased with increase in the HDPE ra-
tio. This suggests that HDPE radicals released during co-pyrolysis
favors the interaction of radicals that results in the formation of
lower carbon compounds ( < C

15 ) in co-pyrolysis oil [69] .

Liquid fuel production is the main aim for oil from co-pyrolysis
of  plastic  and  solid  biomass.  Some  studies  are  available  on  oil
tested in diesel engine as fuel [240–250] or gasoline engine as fuel
[251] from pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis of waste plastics. Only a few
studies are available that provides the physical properties of py-
rolytic oil from co-pyrolysis of plastic and solid biomass in compar-
ison to commercial diesel and gasoline [ 69 , 132 , 146 , 152 ], and heavy
and light fuel oil [196] . Physical properties of some liquid prod-
ucts from co-pyrolysis of plastic and solid biomass are presented
in Table 10 . Diesel engine demonstrated operation with 100% plas-
tic pyrolysis oil without engine modification but with higher lev-
els  of  NO x ,  CO  and  unburned  hydrocarbon  emissions  from  the
burning  plastic  pyrolysis  oil  than  pure  diesel  [ 240 , 242 , 249 , 252 ].
NO x , CO and unburned hydrocarbon emissions increased with in-
crease  in  percentage  of  waste  plastic  oil  in  blends  [250] .  How-
ever, when injection timings were changed compared to the stan-
dard  injection  timing,  the  emissions  of  NO x ,  CO  and  unburned
hydrocarbon  decreased  while  the  CO
2 ,  brake  thermal  efficiency,
and  smoke  increased  [246] .  The  brake  thermal  efficiency  of  en-
gine fuel with neat plastic pyrolysis oil [ 244 , 245 , 252 ] and blends
of  plastic  pyrolysis  oil  and  diesel  [244]  were  lower  than  that
fueled  with  diesel.  This  may  be  due  to  low  cetane  number  of
plastic oil.  Smoke  emission (solid soot  particles) from plastic oil
showed reduction at rated power operated condition in waste plas-
tic  oil  compared  to  diesel  operation  [252] ,  possibly  due  to  en-
hanced  combustion  from  the  presence  of  some  oxygen  in  py-
rolysis  plastic  oil.  In  the  case  of  pyrolysis  oil  from  co-pyrolysis
of  plastic  and  solid  biomass,  smoke  reduction  was  more  signif-
icant  because  of  high  oxygen  content  in  the  original  feedstock.
Although  diesel  engine  can  operate  with  neat  plastic  pyrolysis
oil without any modification as an alternative fuel for diesel en-
gine, blended fuels would be more suitable for long-term use in
a diesel engines [ 240 , 241 ]. Pyrolysis plastic oil was able to replace
diesel fuel in terms of engine performance and energy output pro-

6.1.2. Chemicals in liquid

Co-pyrolysis of plastic and solid biomass is also useful to pro-
duce high-value aromatic (BTEXs) chemicals, which are precursor
compounds  in  pharmaceutical,  textile,  polymer,  automobile,  and
food industries as well as important additives for gasoline [130] .
Tar is a mixture of condensable hydrocarbons that can consist of
over  100  different  substances,  such  as  single  to  5-ring  aromatic
compounds, oxygenated hydrocarbons and various polycyclic aro-
matic hydrocarbons (PAHs) [253] . All the chemical material from
co-pyrolysis is separated and purified according to processing and
utilization technology of coal tar.

Usually,  the  pyrolysis  oil  from  solid  biomass  contains  chem-
icals  with  benzene  ring,  while  that  from  straight  chain  plastic
lacks  such  chemicals.  Pine  wood  oil  with  1  benzene  ring  occu-
pied 63.3% of the total oil yield, however, PE oil contained 91.9%
chemicals  without  benzene  ring  [39] .  The  oxygenated  products
can be classified into carbohydrates-derived oxygenates and lignin-
derived oxygenates. Acetic acid and furans were products of cel-
lulose and hemicellulose via dehydration reaction. The interaction
among phenolic radicals and HDPE-derived H or aliphatic radicals
could occur during co-pyrolysis [134] . Aromatic hydrocarbon yield
could be increased nonlinearly with the increase in proportion of
straight  chain  plastics  [ 85 , 207 ].  In  the  co-pyrolysis  of  LDPE  and
solid  biomass,  highest  aromatic  hydrocarbon  yield  was  obtained
at a mixture ratio of 1:1. As the effective H/C
eff ratio of the feed-
stock was increased with increase in LDPE, more of the biomass
transformed into aromatics. The oxygenates from biomass pyrolysis
further promoted the degradation of plastic with plastic addition,
with the result that the amounts of polycyclic aromatic hydrocar-
bons decreased [85] .

HDPE  produced  an  aromatic  hydrocarbon  mixture  with  sig-
nificantly  fewer  naphthalenes  that  comprised  of  mostly  sin-
gle  ring  aromatics  (alkyl  benzenes).  HDPE  favored  the  produc-
tion  of  xylenes  over  benzene  and  toluene  compared  to  solid
biomass  (switchgrass),  which  favored  less  substituted  species
[204] .  Table  11  compares  selectivity  for  aromatic  hydrocarbons.
Furthermore, increased proportion of LDPE in co-pyrolysis led to
an  increase  in  the  composition  of  aliphatic  compounds  [ 85 , 146 ].
The carbon distribution for co-pyrolysis oil ranged from C
25 in-
dicating  that  the  oil  obtained  from  co-pyrolysis  contained  more
long-chain hydrocarbon in addition to those of LDPE and that it
promoted  the  formation  of  saturated  hydrocarbons.  Decrease  in
the amounts of phenolic and acid compounds with the addition
of LDPE was beneficial for improving the stability of the obtained
co-pyrolysis oil, which can be used as a potential fuel in engines
[146] .

Overall,  straight  polymers,  such  as  HDPE,  LDPE  and  PP  were
more selective for the formation of toluene, ethylbenzene and p-
xylene, because the small olefins were produced much more than
aromatic hydrocarbons from co-pyrolysis, and that the olefins were
intermediates  in  the  formation  of  alkyl  benzenes,  which  were
formed preferentially via the hydrocarbon pool, see Fig. 35 [129] .
However,  co-pyrolysis  of  aromatic  polymers  (PS  or  PET)  with
biomass  was  more  selective  for  the  formation  of  polyaromatic
products. Production of mixed naphthalenes can also come from
the Diels–Alder condensation, dehydration of benzene, and furans
as well as the successive alkylation of toluene with intermediate
allene’s, see Fig. 36 [129] .

Aliphatic hydrocarbon was the major product group, while lin-
ear oxygenates, monoaromatics and polyaromatics were the minor
product  groups  in  the  pyrolysis  oil  from  co-pyrolysis  of  PP  and
solid  biomass,  see  Fig.  37 (a).  Phenolic  compounds,  furan  deriva-
tives  and  cyclopentanones,  known  to  be  major  pyrolyzates  from
biomass, were absent in the co-pyrolysis with PP [103] . Further-
12  aliphatic  hydrocarbons  increased
more,  the  amounts  of  C
with increase in temperature at the expense of decreased amounts
of C
13 + hydrocarbons, which suggested that high pyrolysis temper-
ature could promote the conversion of hydrocarbons with longer
chains to shorter chain products [134] . Compared to pyrolysis oil
from PP and biomass mixtures, production of monoaromatics was

significantly  higher  in  co-pyrolysis  of  PS  and  biomass  mixtures.
Monoaromatics were the major pyrolyzates followed by polyaro-
matics.  The  composition  of  monoaromatics  was  from  36.5%  to
43.7% for all the mixtures examined, see Fig. 37 (b). This shows that
the production of these biomass-derived compounds was greatly
suppressed due to the interactions with PS intermediates during
co-pyrolysis.  The  overall  increase  in  yield  and  selectivity  of  pol-
yaromatics from co-pyrolysis of various mixtures showed that in-
teractions between the aromatic hydrocarbons from PS and pheno-
lics from biomass pyrolysis contributed to enhanced formation of
the polyaromatics [103] .

Although different characteristics exist in co-pyrolysis of plas-
tic  and  biomass  based  on  straight  polymers  and  aromatic  poly-
mers with biomass, it is still difficult to give an overall explana-
tion on the robust synergistic effects in chemical products during
co-pyrolysis of plastic and biomass. However, differences were ob-
served in terms of composition of aqueous phases from pyrolysis
of synthetic polymers (PE, PP, PS) mixed with pinecone and with
cellulose. Non-aromatic ketones, guaiacols and catechols that are
degradation products of lignin were absent in the aqueous phase
from  co-pyrolysis  of  cellulose/PE/PP/PS.  Since  furans  are  formed
from  the  decomposition  of  cellulose,  the  relative  yield  of  furans
from pyrolysis of mixture containing cellulose instead of pinecone
was considerably higher than that of mixture containing pinecone.
The composition of co-pyrolysis oils depends on the type of syn-
thetic polymer in mixture whereas the type and amount of organic
compounds in aqueous phase varied with the ratio of hemicellu-
lose and lignin in biomass [185] .

6.2. Gaseous products

6.2.1. Yield of gases

As a source of hydrogen pool from plastics in co-pyrolysis, hy-
drogen  production  from  co-pyrolysis  increased  with  increase  of
plastic ratio since hydrogen content in the feedstock was higher
than  feedstock  with  biomass  alone  [254] .  Co-pyrolysis  of  plastic
and  solid  biomass  enhanced  the  hydrogen  production  with  in-
2 /100g feedstock (with only pine sawdust)
creases from 10.9 g H
2  /100  g  feedstock  (with  only  HDPE)  [72] .  Note  that
to  37.3  g  H
the  calculated  hydrogen  production  should  be  24.1  g  H
2 /100  g
feedstock, which was lower than the experimental value (approxi-
mate 25 g H
2 /100 g feedstock). On the contrary, increase of solid
biomass in the waste mixture decreased HHV of gas, from 63 to 15
MJ/Nm 3 , as hydrocarbon formation decreased. Additionally, prod-
uct gas density also increased from 1.2 to 1.4 kg/Nm 3 , due to the
increase of CO
2  with addition of pine [153] . When cellulose, in-
stead of pinecone, was mixed with plastic (PE, PP and PS) for co-
pyrolysis, the yield of gaseous products almost doubled and that of

aqueous phase slightly increased. Degradation was stronger in this
case,  as  observed  from  the  lower  amount  of  residue.  This  could
be due to lower amounts of cellulose in the pinecone/polyolefin
mixtures,  because  beside  cellulose,  pinecone  also  contains  large
amounts  of  hemicellulose  and  lignin,  as  well  as  extractives.  Be-
cause of its aromatic nature, lignin provided higher yields of solid
residues than cellulose [ 123 , 185 ]. For the co-pyrolysis of pine wood
samples with PP, the carbon and oxygen concentrations in the re-
sulting  material  were  higher  than  those  obtained  from  pyrolysis
of pure substances due to more thorough biomass decomposition
in alder wood case, which contributed to the radicals formed dur-
ing PP depolymerization. These results support the hypothesis that
addition of plastic leads to a greater degree of biomass degassing
related to types of biomass [154] . From a different perspective, co-
pyrolysis of pinewood with plastic (PP, PET and PC) reduced the ac-
tivation energy and enhanced kinetics due to synergistic behavior
making co-pyrolysis an effective pathway for thermochemical con-
version of biomass and plastic wastes to produce clean energy. The
degree of synergistic influences can be directly seen from the en-
hanced volatiles yield or carbon conversion from co-pyrolysis com-
pared to individuals pyrolysis [2] .

Some studies have shown that gas yields from co-pyrolysis of
some plastic and solid biomass, such as mixture of LDPE and cel-
lulose, were lower than for the individual components at 550 °C
due to synergistic interactions that occurred on the liquid product
from increased transforming of gas [83] . Co-pyrolysis of sugarcane
bagasse and HDPE at 40 0–70 0 °C resulted in improved pyrolysis-
oil  and  char  yield  but  low  gas  yield  [132] .  Similar  results  from
co-pyrolysis of HDPE and waste newspaper indicated transfer reac-
tion of hydrogen atoms and free radicals generation, which led to
interaction between solid biomass and HDPE during co-pyrolysis,
and degradation of functional groups bonded in cellulose structure
of solid biomass inhibiting the release of gaseous products with
low molecular weight and favoring the formation of organic com-
pounds with high molecular weight in oil phase [69] . The reason
for synergistic effects on gas yield is still debated. Synergy could
also arise from physical and not chemical pathways, meaning that
the softened plastic could provide a modified phase for biomass to
decompose and induce diffusion effects on gases yields [255] .

Catalytic  co-pyrolysis  (CCP)  with  transition  metal  is  regarded
as an effective pathway to upgrade the quality of gases products.
The Ni/Al
3 catalyst improved the gas yield as well as the hydro-
gen production in CCP of plastic and biomass due to the promo-
tion of water gas shift and steam reforming in co-pyrolysis along
with steam-gasification  [254] . The  Ni  and  Mo  over  KF-846 cata-
lysts  also  promoted  the  hydrogen  production  from  CCP  of  plas-
tic and biomass indicating a synergistic effect between LDPE and
pubescens [212] . The introduction of transition metals such as Ni,

Pd and their combination into Al-MCM-41 for co-pyrolysis of plas-
tic  and  biomass  increased  hydrogen  yield  as  compared  to  non-
transition  metals  [256] .  Cobalt  based  catalyst  was  used  in  co-
pyrolysis  of  paper  biomass  and  plastic  mixtures  (HDPE,  PP  and
PET), and gaseous products yielded the most during co-pyrolysis
of  blends  having  biomass/plastic  ratio  of  5:1  with  mixtures  of
40%Co/30%CeO
3 as catalyst. The hydrogen gas production
reached peak value of 47 vol%. Higher surface area value with in-
4  indicated better disper-
tense peak formation of CoO and Co
sion  of  metals  during  synthesis  for  better  catalytic  activity  [35] .
The effects of K
7 on co-pyrolysis of plastic and hazelnut shell
showed more gaseous product yield [257] . Investigation of Ni–Mg–
Al–Ca catalysts for Ca content was conducted. Hydrogen yield from
the pyrolysis–gasification of PP and wood sawdust reached high-
est yield with H
2 /CO ratio of 1.90 at a lower calcination tempera-
ture, which was due to the presence of reactive CaO in the catalyst
[258] .

6.2.2. Composition of gases

Increase in solid biomass content in plastic blends increased the
amounts of both CO and CO
2 gases from the co-pyrolysis of feed-
stocks, and is attributed to the presence of oxygen in solid biomass
[ 41 , 89 ]. The effect of plastic (PU)-biomass (wheat straw) mixing ra-
tio on gas compositions at 900 and 1100 °C are shown in Fig. 38
(a) and (b), respectively. At both 900 and 1100 °C, the calculated
of H
2 H m  agreed reasonably well with the measured
values; however, the deviation between the aggregated and exper-
imental  values  for  CO  and  CO
2  depended  on  the  reactor  opera-
tional temperature. This is ascribed to the significant differences in
C/H/O elemental compositions between plastic and biomass. The
C and H content was higher in plastics, while the O content was
only about half than that in biomass. During co-pyrolysis of plas-
tic and biomass, the synergistic interaction produce more OH rad-
icals which attack the polymer chains in plastic or aromatic rings
in biomass and then react with aliphatic species to generate more
CO. The synergistic effect on gas composition was stronger at lower
temperature in the examined range with an optimal mixture ra-
tio of plastic and biomass (3:1) for providing maximum interaction
(5.6 vol.% difference) [41] . On the contrary, addition of plastic (PP)
in biomass had a significant negative effect on CO and CO
2 concen-
tration in the gaseous products obtained from co-pyrolysis. How-
ever, the addition of PP had apparent positive effect on the con-
centrations of basic alkanes and alkenes (C
2–5 ) in the overall gas
phase fractions [154] . Investigation of CCP of pine sawdust showed
4 olefins increased from 0.4 to 22.4% from 400 to 650 °C
that C
4 ; on the contrary, the char and coke yield
along with CO and CH
decreased significantly [259] .

Increase  in  oxygen  content  during  co-pyrolysis  usually  in-
2 in a thermodynamic equilibrium pattern. The
creased CO and CO
synergistic influence was enhanced due to addition of plastic with
straight-chain hydrocarbon, such as PP and PE. The synergy of co-
pyrolysis  of  plastic  and  biomass  was  mainly  from  secondary  re-
actions  between  their  products  [ 255 , 260 ].  The  gaseous  products
from  the  pyrolysis  of  PP  alone  contain  more  than  75  mol.  %  of
olefins, see Fig. 39 . In the gaseous products of the beech wood/PP
mixture  (at  20/80  weight  ratio),  approximately  only  8  Vol.  %  of
the  unsaturated  hydrocarbons  were  detected.  It  is  possible  that
the olefinic products from PP conversion reacted with some prod-
ucts from cellulose and beech depolymerization. The solid prod-
ucts  from  wood  decomposition  provide  a  role  in  depolymeriza-
tion pathways of polypropylene, leading to light liquids [260] . This
behavior  seems  to  indicate  slower  plastic  decomposition,  possi-
bly due to higher consumption of radicals from the decomposition
of lignocellulosic biomass, and lower rate of hydrocarbon cracking
[261] .

6.3. Solid residues and materials

6.3.1. Yield of solid residues

The yield of solid residues from co-pyrolysis decreased with in-
crease in temperature at all mixture ratios examined, which sug-
gests  high  degree  of  conversion  [ 40 , 41 , 152 ].  The  yield  of  solid
residue was also reduced with increase of plastics in the blended
mixture [ 40 , 41 , 89 , 134 , 259 ] and diminished with application of cat-
alysts [ 35 , 201 ]. This reduction of solid yield with increase of pyrol-
ysis temperature and plastic addition suggests its conversion to oil
or condensable products during pyrolysis at higher temperatures.
However, the further higher temperatures caused the breakdown

cations such as inexpensive absorbent, carbon coating, solid fuel,
direct  fuel,  household  briquette,  carbon  sequestration  and  soil
amendment  [152] .  Temperature  dependence  on  elemental  com-
position  of  char  obtained  from  co-pyrolysis  showed  an  apparent
trend that with increase in pyrolysis temperature, carbon content
increased but oxygen content decreased in char up to certain tem-
perature. Further increase in temperature caused a decrease in car-
bon content and an increase in oxygen content. However, hydro-
gen  content  in  the  char  lowered  monotonically  with  increase  of
temperature  [134] .  Due  to  the  higher  oxygen  content,  the  char
from pyrolysis of solid biomass alone had lower calorific value than
those obtained from co-pyrolysis with plastic. In addition, the pres-
ence of very low sulfur content makes these chars attractive for
use  as  fuel  in  solid-fuel  combustion  [185] .  For  co-pyrolysis  with
PP and pine wood, PP addition had less influence on the proper-
ties of char but was noted to have influence on sulfur (less than
0.2%) and oxygen (less than 2.6%) contents in the solid fraction,
which contributed to having an indirect influence on the heating
value  of  char  [154] .  Calorific  value  of  char  varied  approximately
between  27  and  34 MJ/kg  during  co-pyrolysis  depending  on  the
type of the plastic and biomass mixture used. It is noteworthy that
all  the  solid  residues  obtained  were  acceptable  for  use  as  solid
fuel  [ 83 , 134 , 152 , 161 , 185 ].  The  elemental  compositions  and  heat-
ing value of solid residues from co-pyrolysis of plastic and solid
biomass are presented in Table 12 .

Presence of low H/C atomic ratio in the feedstock, in general,
means that the char produced predominantly consists of fixed car-
bon  aromatic  rings  making  the  char  chemically  stable.  The  H/C
atomic  ratio  of  biomass  char  decreased  from  0.415  to  0.378  by
adding  PE,  indicating  that  the  volatile  content  remaining  in  the
solid residue decreased. The H/C atomic ratios of char derived from
the co-pyrolysis of pine wood and PVC blends were lower than the
aggregated results, see Fig. 41 . This was attributed to the acceler-
ated biomass dehydration catalyzed by HCl from PVC, which di-
minished the hydrogen atoms in char [39] .

6.3.3. Surface characteristic of solid residues

Various solid residues with different morphologies can be ob-
tained  from  the  mixture  of  different  plastic  and  biomass  dur-
ing co-pyrolysis. There are two different results of solid residues
produced  from  co-pyrolysis  with  high  hydrogen  content  plastics
(HDPE, LDPE, PP, PS). One result is that plastics improve the sur-
face area of solid residues from co-pyrolysis. For example, the ad-
dition of PP resulted in some rough impure residues on the sur-
face of biochar, which were not present on the rice straw-derived
solid residues. The BET surface increased with increase in PP to rice
straw ratio [33] . The blend of pine wood with 25 and 75 wt.% PE
slightly increased the surface area from 185 to 192 and 201 m 2 /g,
respectively, see Fig. 42 (b) and (c). The interaction of pine wood

of oil to non-condensable gases. On the other hand, pyrolysis of
some plastics such as HDPE, PP, LDPE alone does not produce any
char, or produces small amount of char from PET alone, so that the
char formation from co-pyrolysis with these plastic materials was
always much reduced. The presence of catalysts influenced the C-C
and C-O bond breakage reactions, so that the production of solid
residues was much reduced and transformed to liquid or gaseous
phase products [35] . Co-pyrolysis of plastic and solid biomass ma-
terials  together  did  not  increase  the  solid  residue  product  yield
when temperature was high enough for the decomposition of plas-
tic materials and they decomposed mainly as liquid and gas phase
products [ 123 , 203 ]. But PVC is a different plastic that increased the
yield  of  solid  residue  from  co-pyrolysis  with  solid  biomass.  This
was due to the HCl evolved from PVC that enhanced acidic dehy-
dration of cellulose with increase of aldehyde production and con-
sumption of H and O atoms in cellulose. This aldehyde production
was a marker for the cleavage of glycosidic units. The lack of hy-
drogen and cleavage of intra-ring led to higher char yields [39] .

Acid pretreatments of biomass had a pronounced effect on the
solid residues during co-pyrolysis with plastic. The yield of solid
residue (the sum of thermal char and catalytic coke) was 6.5% from
co-conversion of acid-infused corn stover and PE, and 9.2% from
acid-washed corn stover and PE, and both of the acid washed were
lower than 12% from raw corn stover and PE, see Fig. 40 . Also, the
residue yields were all lower than their corresponding calculated
yields, showing positive synergy between corn stover and PE that
suppressed the formation of undesirable products [203] .

6.3.2. Composition of solid residues

Solid  residues  from  co-pyrolysis  of  plastic  and  solid  biomass
usually  contain  char  and  coke  that  can  be  processed  for  appli-

and PE caused a larger surface area due to less coke deposition
[39] . The interaction of pine wood with 25 and 75 wt.% PVC re-
sulted in decreased surface area of pine wood solid residues from
185  to  17.2 and  0.7 m 2 /g,  respectively.  With  the  increase  in  PVC
content, more agglomerative and smooth of morphologies could be
observed, see Fig. 42 (e) and (f) [39] . Similar morphologies analysis
could be obtained from co-pyrolysis of paulownia wood blended
with PVC [49] .

Co-pyrolysis of PS with walnut shells or peach stone resulted
in  the  break-down  of  the  carbonaceous  matrix  of  solid  residues
can be seen in the micrographs images; co-pyrolysis of PET with
solid biomass resulted in many cavities, wreckages, and intercon-
nected pores of the solid residues; co-pyrolysis of PVC with solid
biomass produced large pores at the external surfaces when PVC
was  molten  at  the  biomass  surface,  see  Fig.  43 .  In  addition,  the
chars produced from co-pyrolysis with PET and PS can be utilized
in such applications of adsorption, anode and functional materials,
catalyst, and other value added product applications [161] .

The other results were that solid residues from co-pyrolysis had
a lower BET surface area than biochar [134] . This is due to the syn-
ergetic interaction between solid biomass (red oak) and softened

HDPE that enhanced red oak decomposition at the contact inter-
face to form large pores, at the same time, the softened HDPE also
prevented volatiles of red oak to escape from the interior regions
and created shallow pores. So, the surface of char was reduced due
to the blockages of the pores by the particulate matter, see Fig. 44
[134] . BET surface area of the char produced from co-pyrolysis and
from red oak alone were 3.80 and 6.75 m 2 /g at 575 °C, respectively.
With increase in temperature from 525 to 675 °C, BET surface area
of char from co-pyrolysis monotonically increased from 3.07 to 7.57
m 2 /g [134] .

7. Challenges and opportunities

With the growing concerns on waste management, co-pyrolysis
of waste plastic and solid biomass have been investigated to im-
prove  synergetic  effect,  reduce  activation  energy  or  energy  con-
sumption, enhance products yield, select products transformation,
mitigate, or avoid toxins emission. To the best of our knowledge,
there are still lots of challenges that we need to focus and over-
come in the future. These issues provide ample opportunities for

researchers and engineers. Specifically, challenges and opportuni-
ties exist for:

(1) Co-pyrolysis of multicomponent mixtures of waste plastic and
solid biomass needs to be considered as feedstocks in the fu-
ture studies as current studies are limited to only binary mix-
tures. However, in the real application of co-pyrolysis technol-
ogy, it is difficult to separate the single waste plastic or single
solid biomass from the waste materials, and then blend the se-
lected feedstocks together to correspond with the optimal con-
dition to obtain desirable results from the co-pyrolysis. So, mul-
ticomponent feedstocks close to real waste mixtures need to be
examined further.

(2) Co-pyrolysis scales that needs examination for upgraded perfor-
mance and scale-up studies. Currently, research on co-pyrolysis
of waste plastic and solid biomass have been investigated both
for mechanism and yields. However, most of the investigations
have  been  at  gram  scale  or  lower.  It  is  essential  to  enlarge
the scale study, and an important target in the future will be
to complete the processes for industrial production and mar-
ket  application  of  alternative  liquid  oil  from  co-pyrolysis.  As
a potential alternative liquid oil for diesel, gasoline and boiler
fuels  from  co-pyrolysis  oil,  there  are  still  not  enough  studies
available  on  its  utilization.  Selected  methods  with  high  effi-
ciency and economic feasibility should be scaled-up and opti-
mized properly to meet the market demand and reduce pollu-
tion from both waste disposal and fossil fuel combustion based
on life cycle analysis. The amounts of waste plastic and solid
biomass that exists in the world, resource quantity would not
be the hindrance. It is also important to pursue technologies for
collection, transportation and storage for the feedstocks along

with the co-pyrolysis technology improving simultaneously. It
is also important to pursue downstream processing for recov-
ery of materials and value-added products.

(3) Autothermal  pathway  needs  to  be  considered  in  co-pyrolysis
process.  This  review  reveals  that  heat  supply  resource  in  co-
pyrolysis is still dominated by electricity, which should be re-
placed by lower grade energy resource before scale-utilization
of  the  co-pyrolysis  technology.  Thermal  energy  supplied  by
combustion of products gases, oil and solid residues from co-
pyrolysis system could be implemented for energy recovery and
waste management. Autothermal pathway in co-pyrolysis pro-
cess could cover a significant portion of the energy requirement
from itself but not from electricity supply, which will make the
technology of co-pyrolysis more economical and be competitive
in energy supply market.

(4) Although different studies have been conducted on co-pyrolysis
of waste plastics and solid biomass over zeolite catalysts, tran-
sition metal catalysts have short lifetimes, low carbon efficien-
cies and high coke formation during the process. This remain a
great challenge. Improved catalysis needs to consider the syn-
ergetic effects between plastic and biomass. The pyrolysis char-
acteristics for both plastic and biomass should also be consid-
ered to obtain the optimal catalyst for the co-pyrolysis process.
Currently, high-value catalysts such as ZSM-5 are not suitable
for operation in harsh environments of in-situ catalytic pyrol-
ysis since coke deposition and deactivation lower their activity
rapidly while lowering their selectivity. So, for future studies on
catalytic co-pyrolysis, these catalysts should be limited to ex-
situ incorporation which can provide high quality products with
minimal deactivation. Developing catalysts with improved resis-

44

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 84 (2021) 100899

tance and applicability in harsh environment needs to be pur-
sued in the future. Suitable catalysts towards this research will
involve utilizing low-value materials and developing carbona-
ceous  materials  such  as  activated  carbon  modified  for  higher
thermal and oxidative stability. However, due to the imminent
requirement for their development and our lack of in-depth un-
derstanding of co-pyrolysis and its complex reaction ensemble,
we conclude this pathway to be challenging and less attractive
compared  to  developing  non-catalytic  co-pyrolysis  with  opti-
mal process performance while the products are improved by
ex-situ  catalysts. This alternative involving ex-situ catalysis is
more  effective  and  favorable  as  it  can  be  used  with  existing
catalysts and operate sustainably for longer time duration. Fu-
ture research can involve improved selectivity towards desired
value-added chemicals with the mechanistic knowledge of co-
pyrolysis and feedstock interaction progresses further.

(5) Separation  and  purification  of  value-added  chemicals  from
co-pyrolysis  need  improvement.  Liquid  compounds  from  co-
pyrolysis are more complicated than that of pyrolysis of waste
plastic  or  solid  biomass.  Although  more  than  hundreds  of
chemical components have been detected in the liquid from co-
pyrolysis, research efforts to obtain chemicals from co-pyrolysis
oil or liquid still lacks to produce high-value products for im-
portant applications, such as medical and food industries.

8. Conclusions

The  co-pyrolysis  of  waste  plastic  and  solid  biomass  were  re-
viewed in this paper. Development of co-pyrolysis of waste plas-
tic  and  solid  biomass  with  focus  on  the  production  of  alterna-
tive fuels and value-added products is essential as this results in
synergistic solution to waste management, climate change mitiga-
tion and environmental protection. Co-pyrolysis provides with effi-
cient waste management and carbon utilization from the wastes
to  help  provide  circularity  to  the  fate  of  fossil  fuels  and  energy
utilized in waste generation while minimizing unsustainable path-
ways such as landfilling and incineration, and providing environ-
mental  protection  by  minimizing  the  growing  marine  pollution
due to plastic wastes and alleviating the toxic emissions produced
from  incinerators.  Thermochemical  characteristics  of  characteris-
tic  waste  plastic  and  solid  biomass  are  reported  in  review  arti-
cle.  Hydrogen  to  carbon  effective  ratio  of  various  waste  plastics
and solid biomass were calculated according to the reviewed refer-
ences. Co-pyrolysis were reviewed from the point of major plas-
tics  (PET,  HDPE,  PVC,  LDPE,  PP,  PS  and  other  plastics)  and  typi-
cal solid biomass followed by summarizing the synergetic effects
and influencing factors between the feedstocks. In general, HDPE,
LDPE and PP have positive synergetic effects on liquid yield in co-
pyrolysis with solid biomass, while PET, PS and PVC have positive
synergetic effects on solid resides or gases yield. The co-pyrolysis
methods and operating conditions with TGA, pyrolyzer, fixed bed
reactor,  fluidized  bed  reactor,  microwave  reactor,  and  multi-step
pathways along with TG, MS, FTIR and their combination were re-
viewed in detail.  ZSM-5  based catalyst,  transition metal catalyst,
multi-catalysts  and  ex-situ  catalytic  co-pyrolysis  (CCP)  were  re-
viewed focusing on catalytic effects with due considerations plas-
tic to biomass ratio, feedstock to catalyst ratio, pyrolysis tempera-
tures, and methods and main products produced. In general, CCP
of  waste  plastic  and  solid  biomass  offers  a  promising  technique
to substantially reduce the energy input and improve selectivity of
liquid and chemical materials. Liquid oil and chemicals, gases and
solid residues from co-pyrolysis were reviewed based on the yield,
composition,  and  special  characteristics.  Finally,  the  challenges
and  opportunities  for  future  development  in  co-pyrolysis  were
discussed.
