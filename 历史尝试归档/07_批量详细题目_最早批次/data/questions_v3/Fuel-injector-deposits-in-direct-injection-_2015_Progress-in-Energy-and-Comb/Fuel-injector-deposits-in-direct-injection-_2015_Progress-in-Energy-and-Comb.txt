Controlling fuel injector deposits is recognized as a challenge for advanced direct-injection spark-ignition
(DISI) engines. This paper gives a comprehensive overview of the research on formation, measurement,
effect, and mitigation of injector deposits in DISI engines. Methodologies for the injector deposit studies
include visual and compositional analysis. It is shown that injector deposits will reduce injector fuel flow
rates, and lead to changes in spray characteristics. Consequently, spray angle and envelope are likely to be
affected, and spray penetration distance as well as droplet diameter can be increased. Injector deposits
are revealed to be primarily fuel-derived and created by two distinct free radical pathways, i.e., low
temperature auto-oxidation and high temperature pyrolysis. Fuel compositions (olefins, aromatics, and
sulphur), as well as T90 parameter, are significant factors in injector deposit formation. The worst
consequences of injector fouling are pre-ignition, and engine misfiring and malfunction. Emissions,
especially particulates, dramatically increase as the fuel injector becomes fouled. It appears that fuel
detergent is the most effective method in controlling injector deposit formation if its chemistry and
dosage rate are optimized. Outward opening piezo-driven injector configuration with a good surface
finish, a sharp nozzle inlet, and a counter bore design, is useful in preventing injector deposit formation.
Reducing injector nozzle temperature by methods such as designing special injector cooling passages,
and improving engine design are also proven to be helpful in reducing injector fouling. Anti-deposit
coatings only delay the onset of injector deposit formation.

1. Introduction

Vehicles powered by gasoline direct injection (GDI) otherwise
known as direct-injection spark-ignition (DISI) engines entered the
car market in the late 1990s [1e8]. GDI engines provide benefits of
high engine efficiency, low fuel consumption and emissions [1]. The
global volume of GDI engines is expected to overtake that of port
fuel injection (PFI) engines by 2020 [9].

GDI engines can be classified into three categories by the
mixture formation process (e.g., air-guided, wall-guided, and spray-
guided) [1]. In the air-guided combustion system, fuel is trans-
ported near the spark plug by a strong tumble flow generated by
inlet ports with a special shape or by a flow control valve in the
intake port. The air-guided combustion system is highly sensitive to
bulk air motion; therefore it may suffer from severe cylinder-by-
cylinder and cycle-by-cycle variations. In the wall-guided com-
bustion system, fuel is directed to the spark plug by a specially
designed piston with a cavity on the crown. Wall-guided GDI en-
gines are commonly referred to as first generation GDI engines. In
both the air-guided and wall-guided combustion system, the
injector and spark plug are separated by a large distance; therefore
they are called wide-spacing concepts. In the spray guided GDI
system, which is referred to as second generation GDI technology,
the injector is close to the spark plug (close-spacing concept). The
injector of the spray guided GDI system is often centrally-mounted,
differing from the side-mounted injectors near the intake port in
both the air- and wall-guided combustion systems.

PFI engines commonly operate under a homogeneous-charge
combustion mode and stoichiometric air fuel ratio (AFR). In addi-
tion to the homogeneous stoichiometric combustion mode, GDI
engines can also run advanced combustion modes such as the
stratified-charge combustion mode. In stratified-charge combus-
tion mode, the air/fuel mixture near the spark plug is stoichio-
metric or slightly rich whilst in the rest of the combustion chamber
it is slightly lean. The stratified-charge can be achieved by injecting
all or a fraction of fuel into the cylinder during the compression
stroke.

The durability of GDI engines, however, can be a challenge due
to issues such as combustion chamber deposit (CCD), injector de-
posits, engine knocking, and pre-ignition [1,10,11]. Studies have
shown that in order to retain the benefits of the GDI technology, the
durability of GDI engines must be guaranteed throughout the
vehicle life time [12,13]. Fuel injector deposits have been identified
as highly relevant, especially when various fuel properties and fuel
qualities are involved [1,14e22].

Fuel injector deposit, or injector fouling, has been observed
since the introduction of PFI systems. This issue may be worsened
in GDI engines, because GDI combustion systems relay more
heavily on fuel spray quality, and DI injector experiences harsher
system
operating

compared to those of PFI

conditions

[1,12,14e16,18,23]. More recently, new technologies developed for
meeting stringent emission regulations, such as engine downsizing,
stratified combustion and bio-fuels, make injector operating con-
ditions more challenging [24]. A modern GDI injection system
features a fuel injection rail or accumulator, which is maintained at
high pressure typically between 80 and 200 bar depending on
system configuration. It generally employs a closed loop AFR con-
trol which can adapt to significant changes in injector flow rate that
may be caused by injector deposits. However the degraded spray
quality caused by injector deposit cannot be solved by the ARF
control; therefore measures must be taken to reduce the formation
of injector deposits.

The importance of the GDI deposit issue is indicated by its
impact on the desired in-cylinder air/fuel mixture distribution,
which is critical to combustion and emissions in such engines
[1,18,23,25e33]. Fig. 1 shows photographs of GDI injector deposits.
The area near the injector tip (Fig. 1 (a)) was covered by deposits
which were mainly fuel derived with some lubricant oil elements
such as Ca, Zn, and Mg [26]. The deposits near the flow entrance
(Fig. 1 (b)) and in the nozzle (Fig. 1 (c)) were fuel derived. Deposits
inside the nozzle can change fuel flow rate, and deposits on the
injector tip potentially distort the spray pattern [1]. Severe injector
deposit issues can cause vehicle drivability problems and misfire,
and even engine malfunction and failure. Thus, GDI injector fouling
is a significant concern for all GDI applications, and requires sig-
nificant attention.

The objective of this paper is to review the background and the
latest developments related to GDI injector fouling. The paper is
organized as follows: firstly, the mechanism of the injector deposit
formation, study methodologies, and the impact of fuel composi-
tions on injector fouling are examined, followed by effects of
injector deposits on engine performance. Finally, strategies for
reducing injector deposits are reviewed.

2. Mechanism of injector deposit formation

Injector deposit precursors are produced from the oxidation,
condensation, and precipitation of unstable HCs such as olefins and
aromatics due to their weak thermal stability [34]. Altin and Eser
[35] described thermal stability as the tendency of deposit forma-
tion on fuel lines, valves, injectors, and combustion chamber sur-
faces. These fuel system deposits can be formed by two distinct free
radical pathways: low temperature auto-oxidation, and high tem-
perature pyrolysis called coking or carbon deposition. Auto-
oxidation and pyrolysis are general terms describing the domi-
nant chemical reactions in the fuel when the temperature is low
and high respectively. A temperature that denotes the transition
between auto-oxidation and pyrolysis is not clearly identified since
the two reactions in fact overlap within a certain temperature
range. Oxidation stability, which is different from thermal stability,

deposition usually proceeds via the polymerization route [35].
Moreover, characteristics of substrate surfaces (catalytic or non-
catalytic) also influence the formation of carbon deposits. A non-
catalytic surface may affect the heat/mass transfer in the system
and act as an inert substrate to collect carbon deposits, the for-
mation of which is thermally initiated in the fluid phase.
In
contrast, a catalytic surface could, in addition, interact with the
reactive species and thus accelerate deposit formation [35]. It is
expected that after the deposit layer is formed on the catalytic
surface, the catalytic reaction is less dominant because the deposit
layer stops the direct contact between the catalytic surface and
liquid fuel. Therefore, the non-catalytic route is more important for
deposit formation on both catalytic and non-catalytic surfaces.

Aradi et al. [25] proposed an injector plugging kinetic model

beginning with two general equations:

Net deposit rate 1⁄4 Deposit rate (cid:3) Deposit removal rate

dV
dt

1⁄4 K1 (cid:3) K2 (cid:4) V

(1)

(2)

where V is a dimensionless deposit volume defined by the deposit
volume divided by the injector nozzle volume; K1 is the deposit
formation rate constant and K2 is the deposit removal rate constant.
An assumption was made in the Equation (2) that the deposit for-
mation rate is zero order and does not depend on the presence of
previous deposits, and the deposit removal rate is dependent on the
presence of deposits and is first order. Here, the flow coefficient
factor is assumed to be constant, and the flow is linear to the
pressure drop across the injector nozzle. The injector flow rate is
proportional to the flow area, which will be reduced by injector
deposits. The deposit area equals to the deposit volume divided by
an effective deposit length. Thus the fuel flow rate loss is propor-
tional to the loss of flow area determined by the net deposit rate.
The derived fuel flow loss is expressed in the Equation (3):

Fuel flow rate loss 1⁄4 (cid:3)K1=K2 (cid:4) ð1 (cid:3) expð(cid:3)K2 (cid:4) tÞÞ

(3)

Based on the Equation (3), the fuel flow rate loss versus time is
comprised of a rapid initial rate of fuel flow rate loss followed by a
stabilized fuel flow loss after a sufficiently long test time; some-
thing which was observed in many publications [18,22,26,36,37].
The basic concept of injector deposits and how they affect the
injector fuel flow rate are clear; however the mechanism of deposit
formation is more complicated.

Kinoshita et al. [22] proposed a GDI injector deposit formation
mechanism, shown by Fig. 2. They suggested that deposit pre-
cursors, as mentioned in Ref. [34], became nuclei depending on the
environment temperature. After a fuel injection event, some re-
sidual fuel was trapped in the nozzle. Initially, deposit precursors
were homogeneously dispersed in the liquid fuel (Fig. 2 (a)). The
proposed mechanism stated that if the nozzle temperature was
lower than the T90 parameter of the fuel, most of the trapped fuel
remained in a liquid state (Fig. 2 (b)) and the deposit precursors
were easily washed away by the following fuel injection. However,
when the nozzle temperature was higher than the T90 of the fuel,
most of the liquid fuel was evaporated resulting in the deposit
precursors adhering strongly to the nozzle wall (Fig. 2 (c)). It should
be noted that deposit precursor would go through the agglomer-
ation process; therefore in Fig. 2 (b) and Fig. 2 (c) the deposit
precursors were bigger. Deposit precursors mainly refer to polar
compounds [34,38e40]. Oxidized hydrocarbon species such as
hydroperoxides, which will be formed after gasoline has been
stored for a long time, are also deposit precursors. Based on the

side [100]; (c) injector nozzle cross section [14] (copyright by SAE International).

refers to the rate at which oxygen is consumed and at which
oxidative products are formed. The liquid oxidation reactions of
alkyl radicals generating hydro-peroxides and other oxidized
products are believed to be responsible for deposit formation [35].
At a temperature higher than 350 (cid:2)C, carbon deposits are usually
formed by two different routes, i.e. (1) decomposition of hydro-
carbons to elemental carbon and hydrogen; and (2) polymeriza-
tion/condensation of hydrocarbon species to larger polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons which then nucleate and grow to become
carbonaceous deposits. Metal catalysis of carbon deposition often
follows the decomposition route, whereas the non-catalytic carbon

research evidence available, metal elements such as Zn, Fe, Cal, Mg,
Na, and insoluble salt are also suspected to support deposit for-
mation [26,41e44], therefore the definition of “Deposit Precursors”
may have to be expanded. However, more research should be
conducted to confirm this.

This mechanism proposed in Ref. [22] highlighted the impor-
tance of deposit precursors, the T90 parameter of fuel, and the
injector nozzle temperature in GDI injector deposit formation. It
provides some guidelines for reducing injector deposit formation.
However, this mechanism is disputed in terms of the role of nozzle
temperature and the T90 of fuel in GDI injector formation. Reducing
nozzle temperature below T90 does not always lead to reduced
injector deposit formation; increasing nozzle temperature above
T90 does not always promote injector deposit formation. The de-
tails will be introduced later in the Section 4.1.

3. Methodologies for injector deposit study

Various methods are available for assessing GDI deposits and
their effects on the fuel injection system. These methods range
from quantitative flow rate tests to complex chemical analysis of
the deposit structure and composition. At the end of this section,
methods for accelerating GDI injector deposit formation are also
reviewed.

(constant flow through an open injector), or dynamic measurement
(pulsed flow). In order to evaluate injector flow losses in-vehicle, a
common practice is to use the injection pulse width provided by the
engine control unit. The injector pulse width will be adjusted to
achieve stoichiometric combustion by using closed-loop AFR con-
trol, if the fuel injector flow rate is changed by the presence of
injector deposits.

3.2. GDI injector spray visualization

Lindgren et al. [29] used spray visualization technologies to
study the spray of GDI injectors. The test was conducted in a
chamber with a back pressure of 150 kPa and a temperature of
20 (cid:2)C, which simulated in-cylinder conditions at the time of in-
jection corresponding to an engine speed of 2000 rpm and 200 kPa
BMEP. The injection pressure was set to 50 MPa. Fig. 3 compares the
images of spray from a clean injector (Fig. 3 (a)) and a fouled

and

scanning

Apart from the flow rate test, the analytical techniques for
characterizing deposits can be classified into three groups. The first
group covers visual analysis like high-speed spray imaging, optical
microscopy
(SEM)
[14,22,25,26,37,45e47]. The next group are the elemental analysis,
typically including energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectros-
copy (EDX or EDS) [48]. Finally, there are compositional analyses
like Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Gas Chro-
matography (GC) coupled with a mass-spectrometer (MS), namely
GCMS, which is able to identify and quantify volatile compounds.

3.1. GDI injector flow rate loss

The primary indication of injector fouling is a reduction of flow
rate. Bench tests consist of either static flow measurement

injector (Fig. 3 (b)). It is found that the pre-jet of the fouled injector
was more dense and penetrated faster compared to that from a new
injector. Controlled by the injection control system, the pilot jet of
fuel was injected before the main jet of fuel was injected. The
quantity of the main fuel jet was larger than the pilot jet of fuel.
Droplets in the pilot jet from the fouled injector had a 30% higher
mean velocity and up to a 17.5% larger mean diameter.

In general, the spray of fouled injectors tends to atomize less and
thus has a longer spray penetration distance. The original sym-
metrical spray can even become asymmetrical if the injector is
plugged to some extent.

3.3. Deposit visualization

Typical magnifications of optical microscopes are around 1000
times, which offers a good resolution. Digital microscopes are
capable of providing 3D display. Optical images help to assess the
form and the principal structure of injector deposits. They provide
researchers a first visual
indication of the nature of deposits.
Generally, magnification is limited by the wavelength of the light
source.

SEMs use an electron beam as the light source. The wavelength
of electrons is shorter than that of the visible light; therefore res-
olutions of 0.2e0.5 nm can be achieved [49]. Many researchers
have taken SEM images of injector deposits [14,22,25,26,37,45e47].

3.4. Elemental analysis

X-ray fluorescence spectroscopes use the chemical/physical
phenomena wherein atoms of one element emit characteristic X-
ray spectra, when they are exposed to high energy particles like
electrons. These spectra are unique for each element.

In the field of injector deposit analysis, EDX/EDS systems are
coupled with SEMs [41,43,48,50]. The combination of SEM and
EDX/EDS makes it possible to generate an elemental profile of de-
posits on injector surfaces. In these studies, researchers found
further elements in addition to carbon, oxygen, sulphur, and ni-
trogen, which have their origin in fuels and air as expected. For
example, Carlisle et al. [43] found further elements, like phos-
phorus, Ca, and Zn, which originated from the engine lubricant.
Fernandes et al. [41] used the same technique for injector analysis.
In addition to the above mentioned elements, he also detected Na.
The analytical techniques above are however not able to give
concrete information about the compounds or functional groups
within the deposits.

3.5. Compositional analysis

FTIR utilizes the principle that certain molecules absorb certain
infra-red radiation. The typical wavelengths used are between 400
and 4000 nm. The adsorption of IR radiation follows the Lam-
berteBeer law; therefore, the adsorption is correlated to the con-
centration of specific bonds. Bacho et al. used FTIR to compare
deposits formed in engine tests and manufactured carbon black
[46,51].

With GC, volatile components in deposits can be analyzed.
Common gasoline GC methods are typically quantitative (e.g. EN
1601 “Determination of organic oxygenate compounds”). When
coupling mass spectra (MS) to a GC, it is possible to detect indi-
vidual single components. Barker et al. [42] used GCMS to identify
organic deposits (after hydro-pyrolysis) taken from diesel high
pressure fuel injection equipment.

Thermo-gravimetric Analysis (TGA) is a technique in which the
mass of a substance is monitored as a function of temperature or
time as the sample specimen is subjected to a controlled

temperature program in a controlled atmosphere [52]. It is used for
the characterization of engine deposits [53,54]. The methods
associated with TGA can be segregated into three groups depending
on the application. The first is a single temperature ramp pro-
gramme to measure differences in the oxidation process between
deposits formed while using different types of fuels and additives
[55]. The second type of test is a more elaborated two-stage method
enabling determination of volatile organic and non-volatile organic
fractions of deposits. Deposit samples are heated in an inert at-
mosphere such as N2 at a chosen temperature rise rate i.e. 10 (cid:2)C/
min from ambient to 500 (cid:2)C (or other temperatures). Air can be
introduced at that temperature, following which the sample is held
at 500 (cid:2)C for some time to oxidize its components (i.e. 30 min). The
sample's total weight loss and rate of weight loss are recorded [56].
The third type of test is when TGA is used for verification of thermal
stability of individual additives as suggested by Ullmann et al. [57].
The above analyses can also be classified into destructive or
non-destructive methods. If a researcher wants to know what de-
posits are within an injector, non-destructive analyses like EDX/EDS
become destructive from the point of view of the injector. Dis-
assembling injectors often means the use of destructive techniques
such as cutting or cracking, which makes it impossible to use the
like spray and flow
injector
measurements.

further operational

tests

for

With currently available analytical techniques, it is possible to
describe injector deposits broadly; however, these techniques still
cannot be used to explain the deposit formation mechanism. It is
down to the judgement of the researcher to combine the analytical
results with the known history of deposits and other tests to create
a complete picture.

3.6. Methods for accelerating GDI injector deposit formation

In order to assess the effect of different fuels, detergents, and
hardware designs on injector fouling,
it is often necessary to
operate controlled laboratory experiments. A number of test cycles,
which are based upon PFI technology [14,58e60], have been
developed for both vehicle and engine dynamometer tests. These
test cycles are designed to replicate normal vehicle operating
conditions. There is also a question of whether accelerated tests are
able to represent real-field conditions. Bacho et al. [51] found that
FTIR spectral analysis of GDI injector deposits from accelerated
laboratory tests were similar to that from real-field vehicles using
commercial gasoline. Therefore they confirmed that deposits pro-
duced in the accelerated laboratory test represent real world
deposits.

The majority of accelerated methods use special fuels to inves-
tigate the effects of certain chemical and physical properties on
injector deposit formation, or to represent the worst case condi-
tions for GDI deposit formation. Many studies focus on the engine
operating conditions known to increase deposit formation. The key
parameters controlled are the injector tip temperature, fuel injec-
tion pressure, coolant temperature, and soak period; all of which
are also used in the PFI injector fouling test [36,51,61]. Several re-
searchers have developed injector tip temperature maps and use
those maps to determine the number of engine cycles required for
accelerated tests [47,51]. Vehicle tests are often related back to field
or standard driving cycles [23,26,37]. Summaries of engine and
vehicle tests reported in the literature are given in Table 1.

Fig. 4 shows GDI injector fouling test cycles, which differ in the
engine speed, injection pressure, test duration, and test mileage
depending on tested fuels, oil and engine designs. Fig. 4 (a), Fig. 4
(a) and Fig. 4 (c) are engine test cycles, and Fig. 4 (d) is a vehicle
test cycle. It should be noted that most researchers have used low
engine speeds (1500e2500 rpm) and medium engine loads in the

study of injector deposit formation. The following is a summary of
the findings revealed by the tests using those driving cycles:

1. Measurable GDI

injector deposits can be formed during

continuous engine operations.

2. Injector nozzle temperature affects injector deposit formation.
3. Fuel composition is a significant factor concerning injector

deposits.

4. The fuels with low T90s, high olefins, and high sulphur are

shown to promote injector deposit formation.

5. Low injection pressure is shown to accelerate injector deposit

formation.

Most methods mentioned above use stationary test conditions.
This is because the purpose of those tests is to achieve fast injector
fouling with typical engine loads and speeds. Compared to tran-
sient states, it is easier to maintain a constant injector tip temper-
ature using stationary state conditions. For benchmarking, the total
running time in most cases takes several tens of hours. The

publication of [36] used the shortest test time (16 h), and achieved a
flow rate loss of more than 20%. The standard ASTM D5598 Cycle
method which contained a few transient stages and some soaking
stages, took 8000 km running to reveal a significant flow rate loss
even for fuels without detergents [23]. The content above also
seems to indicate that pro-fouling strongly depends on the fuel and
injector type, which means a careful design of a testing cycle is
needed. On the other hand, those stationary tests cannot well
represent the real transient conditions, because these road running
states vary the temperature of the injector tip frequently. Currently
there is little information available for the cycle design which
mainly focuses on the impact of low loads and transient stages;
therefore further study is necessary.

4. Impact of fuel on injector fouling

region and season. The market fuel standards in different regions of

the world also vary significantly, as can be seen in Table 2
comparing the EU, US, and China 2013 specifications.

4.1. T90

There are two hypotheses about the role of the T90 parameter in
GDI injector fouling. The first one is that fuels with higher T90 tend
to have less severe injector fouling. The second one is that, for a
certain fuel, a nozzle temperature lower than T90 will lead to less
severe injector fouling than a temperature higher than the T90
value.

There is research evidence supporting the first hypothesis.
Kinoshita et al. [22], as mentioned in Section 2, found that fuel with
a higher T90 led to lower flow rate losses than fuel with a lower
T90. Another study drew a similar conclusion from experiments on
a 2.2 L four-cylinder GDI engine operating at an engine speed of
2500 rpm. 11 fuels were tested and their properties are listed in
Table 3 [26]. Five engine loads were studied with five injector
nozzle temperatures of 120, 140, 157, 173 and 184 (cid:2)C. The injector
fuel flow rate losses for 11 fuels experiencing five injector nozzle
temperatures are listed in Table 4. When comparing the results of

Fig. 5. Relation between nozzle temperature and reduction of injector fuel flow rate
[22] (copyright by SAE International).

various fuels at the same nozzle temperature, the fuels with the
same olefin and sulphur content but lower T90 consistently led to
higher fuel flow rate losses.

The second hypothesis is controversial. Kinoshita et al. [22]
pointed out that when the injector nozzle temperature is higher
than the T90 parameter of the fuel, the injector fouling is more
severe than the corresponding case, where the temperature is
lower (see Fig. 5). This finding is not supported by Ref. [26]. None of
the 11 fuels followed the pattern in Fig. 5. The data in Fig. 6 is from
Ref. [26], showing the results for Fuel 4 (Fig. 6 (a)), Fuel 7 (Fig. 6 (b)),
Fuel 10 (Fig. 6 (c)), and Howell EEE (Fig. 6 (d)). It is clear that a
nozzle temperature higher than T90 does not always lead to low
injector deposit formation. For example, injector flow rate losses at
a tip temperature of 184 (cid:2)C were lower than the cases of a tip
temperature of 173 (cid:2)C. The potential explanation is that the for-
mation rate and removal rate both increase with temperature.
However when the temperature exceeds 173 (cid:2)C, the removal rate
overtakes the formation rate. It is also clear that when the nozzle
temperature was much lower than T90, such as the case when it
was below 140 (cid:2)C, the injector flow rate loss for all 11 fuels were
low.

[26], copyright by SAE International.

Carlisle et al. concluded that T90 was not a statistically signifi-
cant parameter regarding the deposit formation in an air-assisted
direct injector [43]. This conclusion was potentially related to the
unique characteristics in air-assisted injectors comprising of a
conventional fuel injector and an interface region providing a path
between the air and fuel circuits and injectors.

4.2. Sulphur

The effect of sulphur on injector deposit formation was studied
in Refs. [26,36,41,47,62]. It seems that there is not a consensus about
the effect for fuels with sulphur content ranging from 5 to 310 ppm.
As listed in Table 3 [26], Fuel 1 was similar to Fuel 5 except for a
lower sulphur content (30 ppm versus 150 ppm). With the injector
nozzle temperature of over 140 (cid:2)C, Fuel 1, which had a lower
sulphur content, led to higher injector deposit formation than Fuel
5 (see Table 4). The same trend can be found in Fuel 2 and Fuel 6,
and Fuel 3 and Fuel 7. However this trend was not observed in Fuel
4 and Fuel 8, between which there were limited differences in
injector flow rate loss. Ashida et al. [47] reported that alkylate with
10 ppm and 310 ppm sulphur contents had limited differences in
injector fuel flow loss (4% and 3.8%).

The data from Rivere et al. [36] shows that a fuel with 155 ppm
sulphur content had similar injector deposit problems to the fuel
with 90 ppm sulphur content. However, the fuel with 90 ppm
sulphur content had only 10% olefin content whilst the fuel with
155 ppm sulphur content had 15% olefin content. It is not clear
how those two fuels were prepared. Therefore, the comparison of
flow rate loss between those two fuels is not fair and could be
inferred by the olefin factor. Research regarding fuel with high
sulphur reached a consensus [41,62]. Fernandes [41] carried out a
test on a chassis dynamometer and found that a vehicle running

with a high sulphur content fuel (523 ppm) required less mileage
to reach a 30% injector flow rate loss compared with a low sulphur
content fuel (20 ppm). Saito [62] found that fuels with sulphur
content higher than 500 ppm had a greater tendency of injector
deposit formation.

Hydrotreating is an established refinery process that will not
only reduce sulphur content within fuel, but reduce the number of
double bonds within the fuel; therefore, the fuel becomes more
stable. It is expected therefore that hydrotreating will help reduce
GDI injector deposit formation.

4.3. Olefins

The effect of olefin concentration on deposits was investigated
in Ref. [26]. As listed in Table 3, four groups of fuels (Fuel 1 & Fuel 3,
Fuel 2 & Fuel 4, Fuel 5 & Fuel 7, and Fuel 6 & Fuel 8) had similar fuel
properties except for olefin contents. An increase of deposit for-
mation was observed in fuels with higher olefin contents (see
Table 4). Uehara et al. [63] suggested that larger molecular weight
olefins led to a higher injector deposit tendency.

From a chemical perspective, olefins are highly reactive com-
ponents due to their unsaturated carbon bonds and weak thermal
stability; therefore, olefins are suspected to assist deposit formation
through low temperature auto-oxidation, and high temperature
pyrolysis [64]. More detailed discussion about the thermal stability
is given in Section 2.

4.4. Aromatics

Very limited studies have been conducted on the effect of aro-
matics on injector deposit formation. A study into blending various
aromatics with alkylate was reported in Ref. [47]. The details of fuel

properties and fuel flow rate losses are also shown in Table 5. The
results indicated that Fuel 3 (30 vol% n-propylbenzene) suppressed
the injector deposit formation whilst other aromatics promoted the
injector deposit formation. The difference seemed to relate to the
number of alkyl substitutes and their positions on the benzene ring.
It is noticeable that the base fuel had different T90 than all the other
fuels; the differences in injector flow rate loss are caused by both
the effect of T90 and blended aromatics.

4.5. Alcohol

It is widely acknowledged that ethanol is a clean fuel in terms of
soot emissions [65e67]. Since soot and injector deposits are pri-
mary composed of carbon, it is of interest to discuss the effect of
ethanol on GDI injector deposit formation.

Unlike gasoline, ethanol is a single component fuel with no
double bound, making it more thermally stable compared to olefin
components in gasoline. The ethanol molecule has only two carbon
atoms, and most importantly, it has one oxygen atom, giving it an
oxygen content of 35%. Self-supplying oxygen during combustion is
the main reason for its low soot emissions. Even though the
mechanism of PM and deposit formation in the GDI injectors are
potentially different due to the temperature of PM formation being
significantly higher than that of GDI injector deposit formation, it is
expected that ethanol leads to less deposit formation in injectors.
Besides, ethanol has a higher latent heat value; therefore it leads to
lower injector nozzle temperatures compared to gasoline, which is

supported by Taniguhi et al. [68]. They measured the injector
temperature in a 6 cylinder GDI engine at an engine speed of
3200 rpm, 0.9 bar mean effective pressure, stoichiometric AFR, and
optimized spark timing. They found that the injector nozzle tem-
perature for pure ethanol is nearly 25 (cid:2)C lower than that for
gasoline.

In addition to the advantage of using ethanol to control GDI
injector deposit formation, there is one disadvantage, which is
that ethanol has a lower boiling point compared to gasoline.
Ethanol blended gasoline has a lower T90 compared with gaso-
line alone.

There are many publications studying the effect of ethanol on
GDI injector deposit formation. Taniguhi et al. [68] tested various
ethanol blend fuels. The engine was modified to have a reduced
injection pressure of 40 bar, down from the original 120 bar. The
injector tip protrusion was also increased to raise injector tip
temperature. Fig. 7 presents the comparison of spray shapes, noz-
zles, and nozzle holes after a 10 h durability test. The test condition
is also shown at the bottom of Fig. 7. It is obvious that ethanol,
either in a pure or blended form, was able to suppress deposit
formation during dirty up tests. Ashida et al. [47] compared the
injector flow rate loss between base fuel alkylate and blended fuel
with 10 vol% ethanol. They observed that blended fuel led to less
flow rate loss (4% versus 1.5%) after an 8 h test. Dumont et al. [69]
tested E85 in a vehicle for 5000 miles and there were no visible
deposits in the fuel metering orifice and no injector performance
issues were observed.

73

The research of Taniguhi et al. [68], Ashida et al. [47], and
Dumont et al. [69] provides evidence that ethanol is able to keep
the injector clean. Apart from keeping the injector clean, ethanol is
also able to clean up fouled injectors. Dumont et al. [37] found that
E10 (10 vol% ethanol in gasoline) was able to clean the injectors, as a
result of which, the injector flow rate loss was reduced from 18.9%
to 5.5% after a 48 h of clean up test, which is a result of reduced
deposit formation and increased deposit removal. In a later study
by Russell et al. [61], the effect of various market specific ethanol
blended fuels (both corn and cellulosic based) on injector flow rate
of were examined on a four-cylinder 2.0 L GDI engine. It was found
that the fuel flow rate reduction resulting from injector deposit
build-up during a purposely designed deposit build-up test was
statistically equivalent between the different samples of ethanol
used in the study. The test fuels used were within the specification
limits of ASTM D4806 0Standard Specification for Denatured Fuel
Ethanol for Blending with Gasolines for Use as Automotive Spark-
Ignition Engine Fuel'.

Studies about other alcohols, especially methanol that is widely
used in China in blended forms, are of interest. While it has not
been proven, it is suspected that methanol may cause severe
injector plugging problems, due to its corrosive properties. On the
other hand, methanol has a high latent heat value, even higher than
that of ethanol, giving it is an advantage in lowing injector nozzle
temperature. Overall its impact on injector deposit formation re-
mains unknown, and requires investigated further.

4.6. Metallic and insoluble salt

Metal elements such as Zn, Fe, Cal, Mg, Na, and K, and insoluble
salt are detected in fuel injector deposits [26,41e44,69]. The metal
elements are introduced either by contamination, lubricants, or
additives, such as methylcyclopentodienyl manganese tricarbonyl
(MMT). Many publications report that the use of MMT in the fuel as
an octane booster led to increased HC emissions, CCD, and spark
plug [70] and catalytic deposit formation [71e74]. Roos et al. [75]
conducted a survey about injector repairs and replacements in
three cities in America and Canada where gasoline fuel was sold
with and without the additive MMT. They found that there were no
statistically significant differences in the number of repair or
replacement of fuel injectors in cities where gasoline contained
MMT, compared to cities where gasoline didn't contain MMT. De-
posits near the injector tip appear to be primarily fuel-derived but
contain lubricant elements Ca, Zn, and Mg. Internal injector de-
posits inside the nozzle are only fuel derived. Dumont et al. [69]
detected Na, K, and sulphur in the deposit using EDX and further
identified sulphur salt using FTIR. Information concerning the
quantitative impact of the metal element concentration on GDI
injector deposit formation is not available; therefore it remains a
future research interest.

5. Effects of GDI deposit on engine performance

The effects of injector deposit on engine performance and
emissions have been widely reported [1,13,14,28,29,37,43,76e79].
An accelerated deposit formation test was carried out on a four-
cylinder GDI engine, using a fuel with additives known to accel-
erate deposit formation [79]. After a 55 h steady state dirty-up test
(5 bar BMEP and 2000 rpm engine speed), a 23.5% injector fuel flow
rate loss was observed, along with an increase of 20%, 93%, and
2.45% of HC, CO, and fuel consumption respectively. The maximum
power output of the engine was reduced by 1% and the corre-
sponding fuel consumption was increased by 2.2%. As a result of
injector fouling, pre-ignition was observed. An additional 36 h
clean-up test was able to reduce CO and HC emissions to the same

level as recorded at the beginning of dirty-up test. CO and HC
emissions in the 55 h' dirty-up test and 36 h' clean-up tests are
presented in Fig. 8. Sandquist et al. [28] studied injector fouling in a
wall-guided (wide-spacing concept) stratified charge GDI engine.
They concluded that injector fouling was responsible for 80%
increased HC emissions after 60 h of a dirty-up test, which fell back
to the initial level when the fouled injectors were replaced with
new injectors. Misfires and/or partial burn were observed, and even
became unacceptable for some worse case fuels.

There are two root reasons for the deteriorated engine perfor-
mance and increased HC emissions: first, a distorted spray pattern
due to injector fouling; second, deposit formed on the injector tip.
Any deviations from optimized spray patterns, such as changed
spray angle, asymmetric spray envelope, longer penetration dis-
tance, and increased droplet size distribution, have negative im-
pacts on the engine performance and emissions [18,23,25e27].
Wall-guided, air-guided, and spray-guided engines running in the
stratified combustion mode are more sensitive to fuel spray pattern
changes than engines running in the homogeneous combustion
mode [1,16,18,23,80]. The mixture preparation relies on several
factors such as spray pattern, in-cylinder charge flow, spray and
wall interaction, fuel property, and in-cylinder temperature and
pressure [30e33,81]. The direct consequence is increased fuel
impingement and non-optimum combustion, or even misfire; thus
engine power output is reduced and emissions are increased. There
is research evidence showing that an increased mass of fuel
impinged on the cylinder liner due to higher spray jet velocity and
larger droplet diameter resulting from fouled injectors [29]. More
information about spray changes caused by injector fouling is
available in Section 3.2.

Deposits on the injector tip, even though they do not lead to
flow rate loss, can have a negative impact on engine performance.
Deposits will pick up liquid fuel droplets, which cause diffusive
combustion thus it leads to poor emissions. This is proven by
Berndorfer et al. [82] by using high speed imaging in an optical
engine. They observed diffusion combustion near the injector
nozzle.

The impact of fouled injectors on PM emissions has been studied
by the authors' research group in a single cylinder spray-guided
DISI research engine [83]. Two fouled and one clean DI injectors
were tested with gasoline and ethanol engine fuel. PM emissions
were measured by a Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer Spectrometer
(SMPS3936). Fig. 9 shows the effect of fouled injectors on particle
number (PN) and PM emissions when using gasoline as a fuel
(engine speed 1⁄4 1500 rpm, l 1⁄4 1, IMEP 1⁄4 6.5, 7.5, and 8.5 bar). Fig. 9
(a), Fig. 9 (b) and Fig. 9 (c) show the PN emissions in total, nucle-
ation and accumulation modes, respectively. Fig. 9 (d), Fig. 9 (e) and
Fig. 9 (f) show the PM emissions in total, nucleation and accumu-
lation modes, respectively. Injector 1 and Injector 2 had 8.5% and
5.3% flow rate loss respectively. Injector 3 was a clean injector used
as the benchmark. Injector 3 consistently led to the lowest total PN
and PM emissions. The maximum difference was observed at the
highest engine load 8.5 bar IMEP, in which the PN and PM emissions
of fouled Injector 1 were 58% and 300% higher than those with
clean Injector 3, respectively.

Particle size distributions are composed of particles with
different natures: (a) nuclei HCs which mainly compose the
nucleation mode, and (b) soot agglomerates with HCs condensed or
adsorbed on their surface, which compose the accumulation mode
[84]. By breaking down the total PN and PM emission into the
nucleation mode and accumulation modes, it is clear that the total
PM emission of injector 1 in Ref. [83] was increased mainly because
of the increase of the accumulation mode PM emissions. In other
words, soot emissions were much higher for the fouled injector
than the clean injector. This result is in agreement with Berndorfer

et al. [82] in which higher soot emission was found with a fouled
injector resulting from diffusive combustion near the injector tip
due to liquid fuel absorbed on deposits. The research by authors'
research group [83] also revealed that when ethanol was used as
fuel, the PM and PN emissions were not as affected by injector
conditions as gasoline was, for the reasons given in Section 4.5, i.e.,
ethanol has much better atomization and vaporisation character-
istics and in addition, it is oxygenated.

6. Strategies for injector deposit reduction

There are extensive studies on GDI injector deposit reduction
methods, mainly focussing on fuel detergents, injectors, and engine
design.

6.1. Detergents

In China, the majority of fuels are supplied without detergents at
the distribution level, and the use of detergents can be limited to
aftermarket treatment products added to the fuel tank. In the US, a
minimum detergent content is demanded by the EPA [85]. The use
of detergent within the EU is neither demanded nor limited.

There are many deposit control detergents designed for com-
bustion chamber deposits and intake valve deposits, such as poly-
ether amines, polyolefin amines, and alkenyl succinimides.
Detergents work by protecting the metal surface, dispersing the
deposit precursors, and cleaning the metal surface. Fuel detergents
generally have long chain hydrocarbons with polar head groups at
one end of its molecule. The other group in the fuel detergent
molecule does not have a polar property. The polar head group has
a property of easily attaching itself onto the metal surface, forming
a protective surface, and thus preventing the deposit precursor
from depositing onto the metal surface; this process is referred to
as ‘protection’. The polar head group can also attach to deposit
precursors therefore keeping the deposit precursors dispersed in
the liquid; this process is referred to as ‘dispersion’. In the case of
pre-existent deposits on the metal surface, the detergent with a
polar head group will pick up deposits and help to remove them
from the metal surface. Consequently the detergents molecules
break away, taking some of the deposit with them, which is
referred as ‘detergency’.

There is a report claiming that conventional deposit control
detergents designed for controlling CCD and intake valve deposit

were also effective in keeping clean and cleaning up GDI injector
deposits [86]. Many studies have been carried out on PFI injector
deposit control detergents [87e91], however investigations of de-
tergents for GDI injector deposits were only started in recent years
[18,25,36,37,47]. A study of two types of detergents (Manniches and
polyether amines (PEAs)) was conducted in a GDI research engine
[25]. Results show that Mannich detergents were more effective in
injector deposit control than PEAs. In another study of GDI injector
deposit detergents (Manniches, PEAs and polyisobutylene amines)
[36], it was found that some chemicals were more effective that the
other at the same treatment rates. Polyisobutylene amines per-
formed the best amongst the three tested detergents. In the study
of [37], four detergents were tested, and it was found that three of
them effectively removed injector deposits. Nevertheless, in almost
all the literature, the performances of different types of detergents
were difficult to assess because of the lack of detailed information,
or contradictory results of similar detergents.

The concentration of detergents needs to be optimized, since
evidence shows that detergents may accelerate combustion
chamber deposit (CCD) formation [63,92]. Other publications show
that further increasing the concentration of detergents from the
optimized concentration did not have any benefit in controlling
injector deposit formation [36,47]. According to the literature, the
optimized treatment was between 400 and 1000 ppm, depending
on the type of detergents being used.

There is some evidence showing that certain detergents can
help control GDI injector deposit formation when engines were
running in the stratified combustion mode, but not in the ho-
mogenous mode [43]. A Mannich detergent formation (Man C-2(B))
had a good clean-up effect in the stratified operation, but an
opposite effect was observed in the homogenous operation [18].

Most literature available about detergents concerns PFI in-
jectors. Even though the research of PFI detergent is highly valuable
for the design of DI detergent, there are differences between DI and
PFI detergent packages due to the differences in the deposit for-
mation mechanism. Economically, it is undesirable for fuel stations
to provide separate gasoline detergents to PFI and DI vehicles.

6.2. GDI injector design

Studies have been conducted to reduce injector temperature for
the purpose of reducing injector deposit formation. The methods
include changing cooling passages in the cylinder head [22], adding

an injector socket with a high thermal conductivity [22], adding
insulating material on the injector surface to reduce heat transfer
from hot combustion gases to injectors [22,93,94], and using
coatings with a higher thermal conductivity to conduct heat away
from injectors [95]. Katashiba et al. [96] examined a method of
reducing the heat transfer with a combination of reduced injector
surface area exposed to the heat source and the incorporation of a
front seal. Fig. 10 shows that for three different combinations of
injector adapters and injector seal positions (Fig. 10 (a) and Fig. 10
(b)), the temperature of the injector tip was different (Fig. 10 (c))
although the engine was running at the same operating condition.
The injector tip temperature was reduced from 185 to 160 (cid:2)C by
using a narrow opening adaptor and further reduced to 121 (cid:2)C by
replacing the injector rear seal with a front seal.

All of these methods provide simple and effective solutions for
low injector tip

reducing injector tip temperature. However,

temperature may have a negative effect on the spray pattern and
combustion stability [97]. High injector temperatures lead to a
compact spray and smaller fuel droplets [30,97,98]. Increasing the
injector temperature decreased the spray penetration distance and
increased the spray width in slit injectors [97]; however, a reverse
trend was observed with a swirl injector. A slit injector is a type of
injector that produces a fan spray structure. Swirl
injectors
generate thin liquid sheets by opening the needle inwards (inward
opening). Therefore, it can be expected that for slit injectors, by
reducing the injector tip temperature, the benefit of reduced
injector deposit formation will be offset by the degraded spray
quality, whilst for swirl injectors, decreased injector deposit for-
mation and higher spray quality can be achieved simultaneously by
reducing injector tip temperature. When using the strategy of
lowering the injector temperature, consideration should be paid to
match injector types.

injector event ends; therefore VCO layout can also reduce the
diffusive combustion caused by fuel leakage. Besides, the step hole
or counter bore in the outlet side can decrease the impact of the
deposit formation [100].

The robustness of injectors varies with injector geometry and
type. Since deposit formation is inevitable with the use of hydro-
carbon fuels, injectors with better tolerance to the presence of
deposits is desirable [1]. Currently, there are several injector types,
including swirl, multi-hole, and outward opening injectors. The
spray of a swirl injector is more flexible than that of a multi-hole
injector [105]. For a given deposit layer inside the swirl chamber,
circumferential and axial flow resistances inside the nozzle, which
have opposite effects on the flow rate, are both increased [105].
Zhao et al. [1] pointed out that a small amount of deposits on a swirl
injector could change the spray-symmetry. Multi-hole injectors,
which also open inwards, provide better flexibility in the spray
pattern by changing the position and orientation of the holes,
making asymmetrical spray patterns possible. However, multi-hole
injectors are highly vulnerable to deposits formed inside the nozzle
because injector flow is highly sensitive to the change in the di-
mensions of the internal geometry [14,25]. Unlike swirl and multi-
hole injectors, outward opening injectors open the needle out-
wards and generate a hollow cone spray resembling that of swirl
injectors. Outward opening injectors have less cycle-to-cycle spray
angle variation compared to swirl injectors, and do not have the
poorly atomized pre-spray structure which exists in most swirl
injectors [106,107]. Outward opening injectors have the potential to
address typical problems related to spray-guided GDI configura-
tions (close-spacing concept) due to better air utilization than
multi-hole sprays, good penetration during early injection, and the
spray angle being almost independent of back pressure [108]. The
conical shape and zero SAC volume of the nozzle passage of out-
ward opening injectors prevents carbon formation, and the
robustness of the inward opening injectors against fouling can be
improved by appropriately designing the needle tip and seat [109].
The deposit built up may only influence spray pattern, not the flow
rate [108]. The new generation of outward opening piezo-driven
injectors have better performances than, or comparable to those
of solenoid injectors [109e111]. Preussner et al. [105] compared
these three types of injectors. They concluded that the multi-hole
injectors are the least robust against fouling, whilst outward
opening injectors are the most robust. Thus outward opening
piezo-driven injector design is a promising technology for future
GDI injector deposit reduction.

Cavitation in the gasoline fuel injection system is a topic of in-
terest in recent years [112e114]. The injector temperature can have
a significant impact on the cavitation formation [113]. A strategy of
increased cavitation utilized for injector deposit control in GDI
engines is uncertain; therefore it requires more investigation.

A summary of injector design for controlling of injector deposit

formation are listed in Table 6.

6.3. Engine design

In commercial GDI engine development, engine design has to
cover a wide range of requirements. Injector deposit formation can
exhibit a high sensitivity to combustion systems. Compared with
the air-guided GDI system, the spray-guided GDI system has a more
significant injector tip wetting problem due to lower availability of
air motion near the injector tip [1]. Depending on the injector
location, the thermal environment of the GDI injector varies, with
higher temperatures observed as the injector is located closer to the
spark plug and exhaust valve. In the wall-guided GDI system, the
fuel injector experiences a low tip temperature due to a long dis-
tance to the flame front and a strong air movement around the

Fig. 10. Seal and cooling effect of injector: (a) an injector holder with a rear seal and
wide opening; (b) an injector holder with a real seal and narrow opening; (c) an
injector holder with a narrow opening and front seal [96] (copyright by SAE
International).

Anti-deposit coatings on the key injector surface, such as
fluorine-coating amorphous hydrogenated carbon films [99] and
inert amorphous silicon [100], were also tested for controlling de-
posit formation. However, researchers found that anti-deposit
coatings failed to achieve a breakthrough in preventing deposit
layer formation on GDI injectors [82,100]. The explanation is that
those anti-deposit coatings are only able to delay the onset of
deposition. Once a deposit layer is formed, the coated and uncoated
injectors exhibited limited differences in the deposit formation.
Therefore, anti-deposit coatings are not effective in controlling
injector deposit formation.

Better nozzle surface finishing and optimized nozzle shape are
also beneficial for suppressing injector deposits [100]. Laser dril-
ling holes with a smooth inner-surface and sharp inlets could
reduce injector fouling and the interactions between fuel jets
[101]. Sharp hole entrances also contributed to suppress injector
deposit formation, probably due to increased cavitation and tur-
bulence [100,101]. According to [100], a protruded injector tip
reduces the likelihood of the spray impacting the protruded seat
by providing a roughly uniform step hole depth around the
circumference of the step. The protrusion also reduces the likeli-
hood of the spray contracting the face of the seat or combustion
chamber surface by positioning the hole exit further away from
these surfaces. The temperature profile of the seat is also affected
by the protrusion.

Since deposits in the injector nozzle are mainly fuel-derived, any
attempt to reduce the residual fuel inside the nozzles contributes to
a reduced deposit formation tendency. Reducing the SAC volume,
or even using valve covered orifices (VCO) provides benefits in the
control of residual fuel [100,102e104]. In the VCO layout, the
injector orifices are completely covered by the injector needle
when the valve is closed. No fuel escapes from injectors after the

7. Conclusions and future work

A comprehensive literature review of GDI injector deposits has

been provided. The following is a summary of key findings.

1. GDI injector deposits have been found to be primarily fuel-
derived in the literature sources. The presence of injector de-
posits can reduce the injector fuel flow rate and in some cases
cause destructive changes to the desired spray patterns, such as
changed spray angle, prolonged spray penetration distance,
asymmetric spray envelope and larger spray droplet diameter.
Optimized spray is essential to the fuel/air mixture preparation,
thus injector fouling can cause deteriorated combustion and
emissions. Severe injector deposit problems can affect vehicle
drivability and increase misfire. An increase in emissions is also
indicated to result from injector fouling.

2. The primary parameters found in the literature sources are
associated with injector deposit formation are the T90 param-
eter of the fuel, the injector nozzle temperature and fuel injec-
tion pressure. Fuels with a high T90, reducing injector nozzle
temperature low enough, such as 140 (cid:2)C, or increasing injector
nozzle temperature high enough, such as 184 (cid:2)C, lead to less
injector fouling issue. Higher injection pressure contributes to
increase the deposit removal rate, therefore suppress injector
fouling.

3. Fuel composition is a significant factor in injector deposit for-
mation. Injector deposits can be created by two distinct free
radical pathways: low temperature auto-oxidation, and high
temperature pyrolysis namely coking or carbon deposition. High
olefin contents increase the tendency of injector deposit for-
mation due to their high reactive unsaturated carbon bond. High
sulphur content (400e500 ppm) can lead to increased injector
deposit problems.

4. Detergents can reduce injector deposit formation depending
on chemistry and dosage rate. Improving injector designs
(outward opening piezo-driven injector) with good surface
finish and counter bore design can be beneficial in preventing
injector deposit formation. Anti-deposit coatings only delay
the onset of injector deposit formation; however, they are
proven not work well after deposit layer is formed. Strategies
of insulating or cooling the injector tip were shown to be
effective in reducing the deposit
formation in certain
conditions.

Based on the review above, the authors believe that there are
several key areas requiring further investigation for controlling fuel
injector deposits:

International).

injector tip, reducing the amount of residual fuel. Thus it is possible
that for the spray-guided GDI engines, injectors could experience
more deposit problems compared to the wall-guided GDI engines
[26].

Fig. 11 shows the difference in injector nozzle temperature made
by the injector locations (central versus side mount) [96]. The
longer the distance between the spark plug and the injector, the
lower the injector nozzle temperature; therefore lower injector
deposit formation will be expected. Different engine types have
various spark plug and injector configurations. Bacho et al. [51]
studied the GDI injector mounting location and observed that
centrally mounted injectors tended to experience larger flow rate
loss (7.2% versus 2%) compared to side mounted injectors. Another
study also support the point that in the spray-guided GDI engines,
injectors could experience more deposit problems compared to the
wall-guided GDI engines [26]. A primary issue for the centrally
located injector was to reduce the spray structure changes resulting
from the deposit build up near injector nozzle holes [96].

Literature shows that injector flow rate loss varied with the
location of the injector in the cylinder [36]. Due to the difference in
cylinder-to-cylinder injector flow rate losses [36,41], cylinder-to-
cylinder combustion variation was therefore introduced, which in
turn increased the variation of the injector-to-injector deposit
formation.

Increasing fuel injection pressure is proven to be an effective
way of reducing deposit formation [51]. A higher injection pressure
suppresses the injector deposition formation by increasing the
deposit removal rate, and also reduces PM emissions in GDI engines
[115,116]. Currently, the injection pressure of DISI engines is in the
range of 80e200 bar, whilst the injection pressure of diesel engines
is around 2000 bar. Increasing injection pressure in gasoline en-
gines will help reduce injector deposits as well as improving
combustion quality, but will increase the parasitic losses caused by
the fuel injection system.

1. The mechanism of GDI

injector deposit formation is not
completely understood. The only proposed mechanism avail-
able in the literature concerns the deposit precursors, the T90
parameter of the fuel, and injector nozzle temperature. There is
a lack of agreement of the role of nozzle temperature and T90 in
GDI
injector formation. Therefore, a much more detailed
mechanism is required.

save significant
in
improving the understanding of the effect of injector deposits
on spray, but currently it is difficult due to the lack of deposit
geometry information. Existing methodologies are not able to
measure the 3D deposit geometry inside the injector nozzle
and thus a new technique which fulfils this purpose will be
very helpful.

3. More optical studies should be carried out to provide a better
understanding of the spray and air/fuel mixture preparation for
fouled injectors (including all injector types). The data produced
by using methods such as high-speed imaging, PDPA, and laser
induced exciplex fluorescence techniques is also useful in vali-
dating CFD spray models.

4. Several different test cycles are needed, depending on whether
the area of interest is particulate emissions, external deposits or
flow rate restriction.

5. The overall effects of T90, sulphur, olefins, and aromatics on
injector deposit formation in GDI engines require further study.
Studies on alcohols such as ethanol and methanol are highly
relevant.

6. Pre-ignition due to the present of injector deposits needs to be
included within that area of investigation. Misfire/malfunction
is not clearly identified to be an issue in the paper unless older
technology is considered, and even then it is not clearly proven
statistically. PM emissions are yet to be proven to result from
injector deposits in every application of fuel injection in gasoline
engines.
