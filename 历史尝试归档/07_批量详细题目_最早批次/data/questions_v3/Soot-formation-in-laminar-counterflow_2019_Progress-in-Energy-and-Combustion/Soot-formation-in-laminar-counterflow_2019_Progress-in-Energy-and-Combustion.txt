Many practical soot-emitting combustion systems such as diesel and jet engines rely on diffusion flames
for efficient and reliable operation. Efforts to mitigate soot emissions from these systems are dependent
on fundamental understanding of the physicochemical pathways leading from fuel to soot in laminar dif-
fusion flames. Existing diffusion flame −based soot studies focused primarily on over-ventilated coflow
flame where the fuel gas (or vapor) issues from a cylindrical tube into a co-flowing oxidizer, and coun-
terflow flame, where a reacting zone is established between two opposing streams of fuel and oxidizer.
As a canonical diffusion flame configuration, laminar counterflow diffusion flames have been widely used
as a highly controllable environment for soot research, enabling significant progress in the understanding
of soot formation for several decades. In view of the possibility of fuel/oxidizer premixing in practical
systems, counterflow partially premixed flames have also been studied. In the present work we intend
to provide a comprehensive review of the researches on various aspects of soot formation utilizing coun-
terflow flames. Major processes of soot formation (formation of gas phase soot precursors, soot inception
and surface reactions, as well as particle-particle interactions) are examined first, with focus on the most
recent (post-2010) research progress. Experimental techniques and associated challenges for the mea-
surement of soot-related properties (some knowledge of which is helpful for full appreciation of the
experimental data to be reviewed) are then introduced. This is followed by a detailed description of soot
evolution in counterflow flames, which is complemented by a discussion on the similarity and differences
of the sooting structures between counterflow and coflow diffusion flames. Parametric studies of the ef-
fects of fuel molecular structure, fuel additive, partial-premixing, pressure, temperature, stoichiometric
mixture fraction, and residence time on soot formation in counterflow flames will then be addressed
in detail. This review concludes with a summary of the knowledge and challenges gathered and demon-
strated through decades of research, and an outlook on opportunities for future counterflow flame −based
soot research towards a more complete understanding of soot formation and the development of novel
techniques for soot mitigation in practical combustion devices.

1. Introduction

1.1. Motivation of soot research

Rapid  population  growth  and  progressive  industrialization  of
developing countries assure rising worldwide energy demands in
the coming decades: A 30% increase in energy consumption is pro-
jected from 2020 to 2040, even though continuous improvement
in  efficiency  of  energy  use  is  anticipated  [1] .  Although  alterna-
tive sources such as wind, solar, geothermal, and nuclear energies
are increasingly important in the world energy mix, conventional
petroleum-based fuels are still expected to play a dominant role in
the foreseeable future. This is especially true in the transportation
sector, where the society relies heavily on internal combustion (IC)
engines fueled by natural gas, gasoline, kerosene, and diesel. Note
that IC engines use 70% of the 86 million barrels of crude oil the
world consumes every day [2] . Energy from hydrocarbons comes
with a price. Apart from contributing to the greenhouse effects and
thus to climate change, the use of hydrocarbon fuel also leads to
the formation of various hazardous pollutants, including −but not
limited  to −nitric  oxide  (NOx),  carbon  monoxide  (CO),  unburned
hydrocarbons  (UHCs)  and  soot.  Here soot  is  defined as  carbona-
ceous particles resulting from pyrolysis or incomplete combustion
of hydrocarbon fuels. In terms of elemental composition, soot is

largely carbon and may also contain small amounts of hydrogen
and oxygen. Being very fine particles with diameters typically less
than a micrometer, soot is known to be an important contributor
2.5 (particulate matter with diameters smaller than 2.5 μm).
to PM
As far as reciprocating IC engines are concerned, NOx, CO, and
UHC  can  be  effectively  removed  using  a  three-way  catalyst  in
spark-ignition  (SI)  engines  operating  with  stoichiometric  fuel-air
mixtures.  Soot  emission  is  generally  not  an  issue  in  these  con-
ventional port-injection SI engines. But with the advent of gaso-
line direct injection (GDI) technology (intended mainly to improve
fuel efficiency), soot particles can be produced at locally rich re-
gions as a result of charge inhomogeneity. Although the total soot
mass emitted from GDI engines may not be significant, its num-
ber density can still be tremendous, since GDI engines are likely
to produce very fine soot particles [3,4] . Compression ignition (CI)
diesel  engines  are  conventional  producers  of  NOx  and  soot,  and
worse, a trade-off relationship exists between NOx and soot forma-
tion in the diesel combustion process. Many measures designed to
reduce NOx emission result in inhibiting the oxidative removal of
soot, signifying the importance of soot suppression during its for-
mation stage. As environmental regulations on soot emission be-
come increasingly stringent, the incentive for combustion scientists
and engineers to develop innovative and effective methods for soot
mitigation grows with it.

Concerns about soot emission are many and justified. Being the
major  condensed-phase  by-product,  soot  originates  from  the  in-
complete combustion of hydrocarbon fuels. In most cases, the pres-
ence of soot indicates poor combustion conditions, where not all
the fuel molecules can be fully oxidized to form CO
2 O for
maximum thermal energy recovery. Soot particles contain chemical
energy in the form of C-H and C-C bonds, which could be released
as desirable thermal energy if soot formation could be avoided al-
together, or if all the initially formed soot particles were fully ox-
idized in a later stage. Therefore, the emission of soot from prac-
tical combustion devices can be translated directly to combustion
inefficiency.

More importantly, soot emission into the atmosphere has dire
consequences to human health and the environment. After being
inhaled, ultrafine soot particles with diameters less than 100 nm
(typical for flame generated soot) can travel deeply into the lungs,
deposit in the alveoli, and cross the cells to enter the circulatory
system  [5] .  These  ultrafine  particles  can  then  be  translocated  to
other organs like the liver, heart, and brain [6] , causing potential
health issues such as cardiovascular diseases. Polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons  (PAHs),  the  main  organic  component  of  soot,  have
also been associated with carcinogenic and mutagenic effects [7] .
Schwartz  and  coworkers  [8,9]  demonstrated  positive  correlations
between PM concentrations and mortality rates that reflect the se-
rious health issues caused by soot emission.

Regarding environmental implications, soot is a major contrib-
2 [10] . Such efficacy is
utor to global warming, second only to CO
believed to be caused by its influence on snow albedo as well as
its atmospheric stability at high altitudes [11] . Similarly, soot de-
posited on ice glaciers can promote melting, raising the sea level
with all the accompanying problems. Soot particles, with graphitic
carbon as the primary constituent, are the biggest contributor to
light absorption by atmospheric aerosols [12] . The reduction of vis-
ibility  in  densely  populated  urban  areas  due  to  the  presence  of
soot could cause widespread societal concerns. Recent severe haze
events  in  China,  affecting  nearly  800  million  people,  have  been
closely linked to fossil fuel use. It has been suggested that both
primary particulate and secondary aerosol precursors from fossil
fuel and biomass combustion can be controlled to minimize the
negative impacts [13] . Because of its contribution as cloud conden-
sation nuclei, soot in the upper atmosphere is also known to affect
weather in the form of clouds and precipitation [14–16] .

In most cases, soot is the unwanted by-product of hydrocarbon
combustion and its formation needs to be suppressed as much as
possible. However, there are situations in which soot production is
intentional. In utility and industrial boilers, for example, released
combustion heat needs to be effectively transferred to the feedwa-
ter. One important heat transfer mode in such large-scale systems
is radiation, which can be significantly enhanced by the presence
of soot particles [17] . Of course, these particles need to be elimi-
nated before the flue gases are emitted to the environment. In ad-
dition, carbon black is an important raw material for the reinforc-
ing filler in tires and the industry strives for maximum soot yield
for a given quantity of hydrocarbon fuel.

The need to suppress soot emission, or to produce soot with
special  properties,  necessitates  active  control  of  the  soot  forma-
tion processes. This in turn requires a fundamental understanding
of the physicochemical pathways from fuel to soot. Soot formation
is one of the most complex phenomena in combustion, involving
complicated interactions between combustion chemistry, fluid me-
chanics,  mass/heat  transport,  and  particle  dynamics,  so  that  de-
spite  decades  of  active  research,  many  gaps  still  remain  in  our
understanding of soot  [18] . In the attempt to  bridge these gaps,
the underlying mechanisms of soot formation are the objectives of
combustion scientists worldwide, evident from the large body of
literature about soot published in recent years. For instance, soot,

as a keyword, is present in the title or abstract of 45 articles pub-
lished in Combustion and Flame in the year of 2015, accounting for
more  than  ten  percent  of  the  383  total  articles.  This  number  is
even higher for 2016, with 51 out of the 374 articles investigating
soot formation.

1.2. Laboratory-scale experimental configurations

A survey of the literature reveals that a significant portion of
soot studies conducted to date are based on laboratory-scale lam-
inar  flames  at  atmospheric,  or  even  lower  pressures.  This  may
seem inappropriate, at first glance, as combustion modes in most
soot-emitting practical combustion devices are turbulent, and un-
der high pressure. Such a mismatch is certainly not because soot
formation  in  high-pressure  turbulent  flames  can  be  well  repre-
sented  by  those  in  laminar  flames.  One  only  needs  to  consider
turbulence-chemistry interactions and the pressure-dependence of
reaction rates to realize the drastic differences. However, the fol-
lowing facts limit our ability to investigate in detail the soot char-
acteristics of high-pressure turbulent flames. First, the highly tran-
sient  and  inhomogeneous  nature  of  turbulent  flames  presents  a
challenge for many soot-related experimental techniques in terms
of providing sufficient temporal and spatial resolutions. Second, a
high  peak  value  and  wide  dynamic  range  of  soot  loadings  pre-
vent many high-pressure turbulent flames from being reliably di-
agnosed.  Related  issues  include,  for  example,  probe  clogging  for
intrusive methods and signal attenuation/beam steering for opti-
cal methods [19] . Third, it is somewhat difficult to establish well-
controlled  high-pressure  flames  that  are  suitable  for  fundamen-
tal studies of soot formation and oxidation processes; several re-
searchers  have  observed  flame  stability  issues  at  high  pressures
[20,21] . With an increase in pressure, the gas-solid conjugate heat
transfer  between  flame  gas  and  burner  nozzle  becomes  increas-
ingly important and complicates the specification of flow boundary
conditions [22] .

In  addition  to  the  above  technical  constraints,  the  fact
that  physicochemical  formation  pathways  of  soot  are  still  not
fully understood −even in zero-dimensional systems −may provide
enough rationale for the wide interests in soot studies with sim-
ple  flow  configurations.  In  this  regard,  various  laboratory-scale
setups have been employed, including constant volume combus-
tion chambers [23–30] , shock tubes [31–40] , well-stirred reactors
[41–45] ,  burner-stabilized  flat  premixed  flames  [46–55] ,  coflow
diffusion flames [56–72] , and counterflow diffusion flames (CDF)
[73–92] . The conditions for soot formation can be very different
among these experimental configurations and conclusions regard-
ing  the  sooting  processes  obtained  from  one  configuration  may
not be directly applicable to others. For example, the trend that
soot loadings increase with the increase in flame temperature [93–
96] , as observed in diffusion flames, can be reversed in some pre-
mixed flames [97–99] . This can be explained (at least partly) by
noting that unlike in a diffusion flame, a very rich fuel pyrolysis re-
gion, where soot precursors are formed without oxidation, usually
does not exist in a premixed flame. In addition, certain fuel addi-
tives may play different roles, sometimes with opposite effects on
soot formation in different reacting systems. The doping of small
amounts of ethanol, or dimethyl ether, was seen to boost soot vol-
ume fractions in ethylene diffusion flames [100,101] ; but it inhib-
ited soot formation in ethylene/air premixed flames [102,103] .

Constant  volume/pressure  combustion  chambers  are  typically
used to study liquid fuel spray combustion [23–30] , a close repre-
sentation of the combustion process in CI engines. Unfortunately,
soot formation during the burning of fuel sprays depends not only
on soot chemistry but on many other physical processes such as
spray  penetration,  droplet  size  distribution,  and  velocity  field  of
the entrained air. It is challenging to isolate these factors to obtain

156

quantitative information on soot behaviors. Note that a shock tube
can  provide  homogeneous,  constant  pressure/temperature  condi-
tions, ideal for studying the chemistry of fuel pyrolysis and subse-
quent soot formation. However, the time scale of the sooting pro-
cesses in shock tube experiments is typically 1 ∼2 orders of magni-
tude shorter than that in flames [31] . For this reason, shock tubes
are primarily used for investigation of early stage soot formation;
while slower processes such as particle coagulation and aggrega-
tion cannot be effectively examined [31] . A jet-stirred reactor (JSR)
is an alternative way to reach constant pressure and temperature
conditions, and the residence time can be varied by changing the
reactants’ flow  rates.  However,  external  heat  sources  are  needed
and typical temperature achievable in JSR experiments is only at
the lower end of flame environments. Moreover, the reactants in
shock  tubes  or  JSR  are  highly  diluted  by  inert  gas  (e.g.,  argon)
in most cases, differing noticeably with practical flame conditions.
Note that the effect of reactant dilution on soot formation can be
significant [95,104] .

The details of soot formation in turbulent diffusion flames en-
tail complex study, and most combustion systems rely on turbu-
lent diffusion flames for operation. Fortunately, the concept of lam-
inar flamelets could provide a link between turbulent and lami-
nar diffusion flames [105,106] . Fundamental investigations of the
pathways from fuel molecules to soot particles in laminar diffu-
sion flames can provide essential information toward clarifying the
sooting process in practical flames.

Soot formation characteristics in laminar diffusion flames have
been extensively studied in over-ventilated coflow diffusion flames,
where the fuel gas (or vapor) issues from a cylindrical tube into co-
flowing oxidizer [107] , and counterflow flames, where a reaction
zone is established between two opposing streams of fuel and oxi-
dizer [108,109] . The general features of the flow configurations dif-
fer between these two types of flames. A coflow flame has a two-
dimensional flow field so that the species concentrations, temper-
atures, and flow velocities vary in both axial and radial directions.
A counterflow flame, on the other hand, is quasi-one-dimensional
along the normal direction of the flame, a feature that significantly
facilitates  the  analysis  of  flame/sooting  structures.  This  becomes
particularly relevant if models with detailed chemical kinetics and
particle dynamics are to be employed for the simulation of these
flames, as the decreased dimensionality of counterflow flames sig-
nificantly reduces the computational cost. To give an example, a
recent computational work [110] on an ethylene/air coflow flame
using a semi-detailed chemical reaction mechanism [111,112] and a
sectional soot model was reported to take a wall time of more than
150 hours on a 400 CPU Linux cluster (i.e., 60,0 0 0 CPU hours) for
convergence; similar work for one-dimensional counterflow flames
typically takes no more than several hours on a PC. Also, it is gen-
erally believed that a reacting zone of premixed nature is respon-
sible for the stabilization and attachment of the flame to the noz-
zle in a coflow diffusion flame. This premixed zone exists due to
the inter-diffusion of fuel and oxidizer in the vicinity of the burner
nozzle, where chemical reactions are inhibited by heat and radi-
cal losses to the wall [109,113] . Therefore, coflow diffusion flames
are also affected by the characteristics of this stabilizing premixed
edge flame. For this reason, some fundamental aspects of diffusion
combustion are thought not to be well represented by coflow dif-
fusion flames, while counterflow diffusion flames are recognized as
pure diffusion flames [109] . Finally, the residence time in coflow
flames is relatively long and sometimes difficult to parameterize.
In counterflow flames, residence time and stretch rate can be ad-
justed by varying fuel and/or oxidizer flow velocities, providing a
unique way to study soot chemistry with variable residence time.
Also,  its  much  shorter  residence  time  is  more  representative  of
the turbulent processes in practical flames [114] . Despite the above
merits, it is important to point out that counterflow flames also

have  disadvantages.  For  instance,  a  counterflow  flame  is  usually
rather confined in space, necessitating high spatial resolution for
its diagnostic. In contrast, coflow flames are more spread out spa-
tially which makes probe sampling of the gas phase or particulates
much easier.

Major  differences  exist  in  the  sooting  characteristics  between
coflow and counterflow diffusion flames. Soot formed in the fuel-
rich region of a normal coflow flame is always convected down-
stream, towards the high temperature flame front where fuel and
oxidizer are mixed stoichiometrically. As a result, oxidation of soot
by  oxygen  and  hydroxyl  radical  is  inevitable.  In  fact,  the  widely
referred smoke point condition is a critical condition where soot
formation is balanced just by its oxidation [104,115–117] . But for
counterflow diffusion flames, the absence or presence of soot ox-
idation  depends  on  the  relative  position  between  the  stagnation
plane and the flame front. By adjusting the dilution ratio of the
fuel  and  oxidizer  streams  (and  thus  the  stoichiometric  mixture
fraction),  it  is  possible  to  establish  a  soot  formation  (SF)  flame
where soot particles, once formed, are convected away from the
flame without further oxidation [73] . In this way, the soot forma-
tion process, as well as the physicochemical features of the flame-
generated  soot,  can  be  investigated  with  little  interference  from
soot  oxidation.  Detailed  descriptions  of  the  sooting  processes  in
diffusion flames are covered in a later section, but it can be seen
from the above discussion that counterflow flames provide a well-
defined,  canonical  configuration  to  complement  coflow  diffusion
flames for soot research on diffusion flames.

The  literature  on  soot  formation  is  extensive  and  excellent
reviews  [18,31,34,99,107,118–128]  were  periodically published  to
summarize research progress. Many of these reviews had a spe-
cific focus. For example, in addition to providing an excellent the-
oretical  discussion  on  the  general  kinetic  pathways  of  soot  for-
mation,  experimental  data  reviewed  by  Wang  [18]  were  largely
based on studies of burner-stabilized premixed flames. The work
of Eremin [31] focused on the formation of soot particles in shock
tubes  while  Tree  and  Svesson  [124]  analyzed  soot  processes  in
compression ignition engines. D’Anna [125] insightfully examined
both  numerical and experimental aspects of  nanoparticle forma-
tion  in  laminar  flames,  focusing  on  premixed  and  coflow  diffu-
sion flames, while with limited coverage on counterflow diffusion
flames.  Karata  ̧s  and  Gülder  [107]  offered  a  dedicated  review  on
high-pressure coflow diffusion flames. Despite the importance of
soot studies in laminar counterflow flames, and the many impor-
tant conclusions drawn from them, there has been no dedicated
review in the open literature summarizing soot research in these
flames, which dates back to 1980s and continues to contribute to
our expanding knowledge on soot. The special features of soot pro-
cesses in counterflow flames certainly deserves such efforts. Mo-
tivated by this, we intend to provide a comprehensive survey of
research outcomes resulting from investigations of soot formation
in counterflow flames, complementing existing reviews on soot re-
search in many other flame/reactor configurations.

1.3. Structure of this review

Following is the structure of this survey of soot research in lam-
inar counterflow flames. First, an overview of the soot formation
pathways is revisited, with special attention paid to the most re-
cent progress. The discussion follows the generally acknowledged
major  processes  of  soot  formation  [122] :  (1)  gas-phase  precur-
sor  formation;  (2)  soot  nucleation;  (3)  particle  surface  growth,
particle  coalescence  and  agglomeration;  and  (4)  soot  oxidation
and fragmentation. Experimental methods for soot diagnostics are
then briefly discussed to provide necessary background for follow-
ing discussions on the general sooting structures of diffusion and
partially-premixed flames. Similarities and differences in the soot

evolution  processes  between  coflow  and  counterflow  flames  are
also highlighted. Experimental and numerical counterflow flame-
based soot studies are then extensively reviewed and the materials
are organized based on the various factors affecting soot formation,
including  fuel  molecular  structure,  fuel  additives,  pressure,  tem-
perature, residence time, external fields, and flame unsteadiness.
The discussion on fuel molecular structure also summarizes vari-
ous quantitative indices developed to represent sooting tendencies
of different fuels, which may find application in assessing and for-
mulating surrogate fuels for sooting tendencies. These indices in-
clude the conventional smoke point , the coflow flame-based yield
soot  index  and  the  newly  proposed,  CDF-based  sooting  tempera-
ture index and sooting sensitivity index . This review concludes with
a brief summary and an outlook on research needs, with respect
to both experimental and numerical aspects, for promoting funda-
mental understanding of soot formation in counterflow flames.

2. Pathways of soot formation

The  physicochemical  pathways  from  gas-phase  fuels  to  soot
particles in flames are not only complex but intellectually intrigu-
ing.  It  may  seem  impossible  that  structurally  ordered  solids  can
be  formed  under  violent  entropy-increasing  flame  conditions.  In
fact,  as  noted  by  Wang  [18] ,  dehydrogenation  from  hydrocarbon
fuel molecules and the accompanied release of H
2 are important in
decreasing the Gibbs free energy of the system, driving soot forma-
tion processes forward. Nevertheless, such a thermodynamic driv-
ing force is moderate, so the soot process is kinetically controlled
and can be highly reversible [18] .

Although many details are still not fully understood, decades of
extensive research have led to the general belief that soot forma-
tion starts with the formation of gas-phase molecular species from
fuel pyrolysis, followed by incipient ring formation, PAH growth,
particle  nucleation,  heterogeneous  surface  reaction,  and  particle-
particle  interactions.  For  clarification,  Fig.  1  shows  a  conceptual
schematic of this overall physicochemical pathway. This now well-
known pathway is a frequent review subject, although new find-
ings  are  added  continuously.  This  section  provides  a  systematic
summary of the most recent discoveries in soot formation mecha-
nisms. The material in this section will not be restricted to coun-
terflow  flames,  since  the  fundamental  chemistry  involved  in  the
process of soot formation is expected to share similarities among
different flame configurations [107] .

It is our intention to provide a detailed description of our up-
to-date understanding on soot formation. We think that such in-
formation can be a useful background knowledge to put the re-
sults  of  the  to-be-reviewed  counterflow-based  fundamental  soot
studies into the context of understanding soot formation from first
principles. Before detailed presentation, it is worthwhile to point

out that the discussion below may contain historical developments
that overlapped with previous reviews such as Richter and Howard
[121] , McEnally et al. [123] , D’Anna [125] , Wang [18] , and Karatas
and Gülder [107] . Although we focused on the most recent devel-
opments after 2010, a certain degree of overlaps is unavoidable for
a systematic discussion.

2.1. Gas phase precursor formation

2 H

2 /C

Although polyacetylenes [129,130] and ionic species [131] have
historically been proposed as soot precursors, it is now widely ac-
cepted that the formation of PAHs is the key step in bridging the
gap between gaseous fuel molecules and solid soot particles. De-
tailed reaction pathways are still needed to validate polyacetylenes
hypothesis against measurements. The experimental results of low
concentrations of chem-ions [132] and low levels of ionization for
large hydrocarbons in fuel rich sooting flames [133] , as well as the
absence  of  ionic  species  in  soot-forming  pyrolysis  environments
[134] , support evidence against the ionic mechanism. These are in
contrast to the fact that the PAH hypothesis has been substanti-
ated by numerous experimental and numerical studies [122] . For
example,  through  a  computational  investigation,  Stein  and  Fahr
[135]  found that the most  thermodynamically stable species at
2 mixture were PAH molecules, sug-
high temperatures in a H
gesting their important roles in soot formation. The more recent
work by Johansson et al. [136–138] suggesting the importance of
non-stabilomer PAHs in soot formation will be discussed later. In
addition,  on  a  macroscopic  scale,  it  was  observed  in  a  series  of
shock tube pyrolysis experiments that aromatic fuels (benzene and
toluene) and cyclic compounds that can readily aromatize (e.g., 1,4-
cyclohexadiene) have the highest soot yields, followed in order by
species that can also have ring ruptures competing with aromatiza-
tion (e.g., cyclopentadiene) and those that can be easily fragmented
(e.g., cyclohexane) [139] . Many recent PAH-based soot models with
detailed chemical kinetics have gained unprecedented success in
predicting the sooting characteristics of hydrocarbon flames, espe-
cially in terms of the effects of fuel molecular structures [112,140] .
Nevertheless, we are probably still not in a position to exclude the
possible contribution of polyacetylenes and ionic species to soot
formation, and more research is required to unravel this problem.
In this study, however, we will presume that PAHs are the primary
soot precursors and detailed discussions on other alternatives are
beyond the scope of this review.

2.1.1. Formation of first aromatic ring

A number of reaction routes have been proposed for the growth
of PAHs in hydrocarbon flames, and the relative importance of each
individual pathway was shown to be notably dependent on fuel
molecular  structure,  as  well  as  pressure  and  temperature  condi-

158

tions  [121] .  For  aliphatic  fuels,  it  may  be  logical  to  expect  the
growth  of  PAHs  to  start  from  the  first  aromatic  ring,  which  in
many cases is benzene or phenyl radical. Pioneering works on py-
rolysis/oxidation of acetylene (C

The importance of (R1) and (R2) was substantiated by West-
moreland and coworkers [149,150] , who screened various benzene
formation pathways by comparing experimentally-obtained species
mole  fraction  profiles  with  predicted  ones  in  a  series  of  low-
pressure fuel-rich premixed C
2 /Ar flames. They employed the
2 /O
concept of chemical activation and considered the effects of pres-
sure falloff, proposing rate constants of relevant reactions at differ-
ent pressures instead of using high-pressure limits [149,151] . Al-
though  the  recombination  of  two  propargyl  radicals  (C
3 )  was
also seen to  be a  promising route  for benzene formation in the
initial screening, they ruled out this possibility as they presumed
that  subsequent  cyclization/hydrogen  redistribution  of  the  C
3 -
C

3 adduct would result in serious difficulties [149] .
Nevertheless, the role of C

3  in cyclization reactions has at-
tracted considerable research effort since late 1980s. This is due

partly to the recognition that C
resonantly stabilized radicals (RSRs) during hydrocarbon combus-
tion.  Being  an  RSR,  C
3  is  more  stable  than  ordinary  radicals
and its chance for survival in a hostile combustion environment
is  greater.  As  a  result,  it  can  be  accumulated  to  a  much  higher
concentration, making its reactions attractive cyclization routes. It
is also noteworthy that although C
3  is less reactive than ordi-
nary radicals, the C
3 addition is still a radical-radical reac-
tion, so its rates can be significantly higher than those of radical-
molecule reactions like (R1) and (R2) [152] .

The dominant contribution of (R5) and (R6) to benzene forma-
tion was supported by Stein et al. [153] , who independently mod-
eled benzene formation rates in C

stantiated by the following works on flames of other aliphatic fuels
such as methane (CH

also necessary to explain the relative tendency of benzene forma-
tion during the oxidation of C

The  chemical  pathway  for  propargyl  recombination  is  in  fact
more  complex  than  it  may  seem  in  (R5)  and  (R6) .  Based
on  computed  potential  energy  surfaces,  Miller  and  Klippenstein
[166] found that three varieties of energized linear C
6 adduct can
be formed, and each can further isomerize among various forms,
dissociate into bimolecular products or back into the reactants. Ad-
ditional product channels (R7) and (R8) for propargyl recombina-
tion were proposed [167] based on this theoretical analysis, and
related rate coefficients for (R5) through (R8) were modified to re-
flect more recent rate calculations [168] .

and Klippenstein [166] , (R5) through (R8) do not represent a com-
plete description of C

as  a  lumped  model,  they  are  suitable  for  applications  in  typi-
cal flame conditions. Caution is required if they are used in low-
temperature and high-pressure conditions.

Recent  developments  and  applications  of  synchrotron-based

could  provide  isomer-resolved intermediate  species  identification
and  quantification,  have  contributed  significantly  to  our  under-
standing on flame chemistry [172] . A number of premixed fuel-rich
flames  burning  aliphatic  fuels  were  investigated  with  this  tech-
nique, and it was found that reactions involving propargyl radical
(i.e., (R5) through (R9) ) are always important, while contributions
from other pathways are somewhat fuel dependent [172,173] . For

From the above discussions, it is clear that—with the notable
exception of (R1) and (R2) —the majority of the important benzene
formation pathways identified thus far for flames of aliphatic fuels
involve RSRs, suggesting their significance.

It is useful to point out that benzene is not necessarily the first
aromatic  ring  to  form  during  the  combustion  of  aliphatic  fuels.
There are several other aromatic species that can serve as precur-
sors to grow to larger PAHs and soot. Bockhorn et al. [188] pro-

2.1.2. Molecular growth beyond the first aromatic ring

The  necessity  to  form  the  first  aromatic  ring  for  the  initia-
tion of soot formation applies only to aliphatic fuels. For combus-
tion systems fueled by aromatics, molecular growths beyond the
first aromatic ring become the critical and rate-limiting steps to-
ward  soot  formation.  In  such  cases,  the  aromatic  rings  must  be
broken  to  provide  the  intermediate  species  required  for  subse-
quent  molecular  growth,  which  will  lead  to  PAHs  with  increas-
ingly  complicated  structures.  It  may  not  be  difficult  to  imagine
that the number of reaction pathways involved in forming these
large PAH molecules grows exponentially with their sizes. Wang
[18]  pointed  out  that  it  is  still  not  known  whether  the  number
can  be  treated  as  finite.  On  the  other  hand,  it  becomes  compli-

cated to obtain direct experimental evidence of any proposed re-
action pathways for large PAHs, caused primarily for the follow-
ing reasons. First, the concentrations of large PAHs in flames are
typically  very  low.  In  fact,  it  was  reported  that  peak  mole  frac-
tions  of  PAHs  can  drop  by  one  order  of  magnitude  with  every
growth of two fused rings [18] . Besides the slow kinetics for PAH
growth,  this  can  also  be  understood  from  the  fact  that  as  PAHs
get larger, they are more likely to form soot, removing themselves
from the gas phase. The result is that instruments with continu-
ous  improvements  in  detection  limits  are  needed  if  increasingly
larger  species  are  to  be  measured.  Second,  many  isomers  exist
for large PAHs, and isomeric-specific identification becomes pro-
gressively  more  difficult  as  PAHs  grow  larger.  For  example,  as  a
major isomer-specific measurement technique for small molecules,
the synchrotron-based photo-ionization flame-sampling molecular
beam  mass  spectrometry  (MBMS)  is  confronted  with  significant
challenges in isolating isomers of large molecules due (partially)
to the uncertainty of obtaining their ionization energies. Neverthe-
less,  theoretical  and  experimental  investigations  during  the  past
decades did provide considerable knowledge about the formation
pathways of large PAHs, which is being used successfully in a vari-
ety of models for the simulation of soot.

The most well-known PAH growth pathway is the hydrogen-abstraction-C

2 -addition mechanism (or HACA for short) proposed by
Frenklach et al. [141,142,146,198] . In its essence, this HACA mechanism represents a repetitive reaction sequence of (1) radical activation
2 molecule addition to the radical site. Taking the growth from benzene (A1) to
by H-atom abstraction from stable molecules and (2) C
naphthalene (A2) as an example, the HACA mechanism is realized as:

Alternatively, the addition of acetylene to phenyl radical can also lead to naphthalene formation through the following reaction:

(R23)

(R24)

(R23) and (R24) were initially included in the model for the prediction of soot formation in shock tube pyrolysis of C

2 [141] , and
it was found that (R23) played the dominant role. Frenklach et al. [141] attributed this to the instability of the A1CHCH adduct, which
2 addition can occur. After the formation
has a greater likelihood to decompose to the stable phenylacetylene molecule before further C
2 addition can lead
of naphthalene, further hydrogen abstraction from the naphthalene molecule (by hydrogen atom) and subsequent C
2 H
to the formation of phenanthrene. Similar processes continue to form larger and larger PAHs, thus repetitive . Using the notations A
i and
i -  to represent aromatic species and its radical with i -number of rings, such a repetitive process can be represented in the following

sequences:

It is important to note that as the related thermodynamic driving forces are only moderate, the HACA reaction sequences are highly
reversible. In fact, the degree of reversibility of (R25) −(R29) determines whether the HACA steps can contribute to PAH growth [122] .
Therefore, reliable thermodynamic data of PAH species [199] , from which reverse reaction rates can be calculated, become a prerequisite
for accurate modelling of PAH and soot formation.

As Wang [18] pointed out, the HACA mechanism describes a process that satisfies the core thermodynamic and kinetic requirements
of a sooting process. On one hand, soot precursors must survive hostile flame environments, and in this regard, peri-condensed PAHs are
known to be among the most important stable species in sooting flames. On the other hand, before further molecular growth can occur,
stable PAHs must be activated to form corresponding aryl radicals, achievable via hydrogen abstraction reactions. As the most important
intermediates in sooting flames, C
2 serves as the building block for mass growth. In addition, these reactions have energy barriers and
are highly reversible, giving temperature a critical role. When detailed structures of PAH and their radicals are considered, the addition
2 can have many different and complicated realizations −(R25) through (R29) are only global representations. For more details we
of C
refer to a recent work by Frenklach and coworkers [200] in which a comprehensive list of reaction channels is provided. Despite its central
importance, the HACA mechanism may be only one realization of the complex PAH growth pathways. Several other reaction sequences
have also been shown to contribute to PAH growths.

Shukla et al. [206] further examined the mass spectra of the pyrolysis products of toluene/acetone mixtures at three different tem-
peratures and found that mass peaks occurred in bundles, with intervals of 14-mass unit. In addition, an individual major mass peak
was preceded by a peak two-mass unit (sometimes also four-mass unit) lower, which became more pronounced at higher temperatures.
Based on this compelling experimental evidence and relevant chemical reasoning, they proposed the methyl addition/cyclization (MAC)
mechanism as a growth pathway for PAHs, which is depicted in Fig. 3 [206] . Note that the MAC mechanism explains the expansion from
cyclotetrafused to cyclopentafused, and then to hexagonal networks. The sequences with blue arrows in Fig. 3 provide one example. Note
that the MAC pathways were also substantiated by more recent mass spectral studies of counterflow diffusion flames of C

Indenyl radical can further contribute to pyrene formation through self-combination, or addition to benzyl radical, the global reaction

It can be inferred from the above discussions that there exist many different pathways to PAH growth, and the relative importance of
each individual pathway depends on fuel molecular structures as well as flame environments. In addition, resonantly stabilized radicals
such as propargyl, substituted propargyl, cyclopentadienyl, benzyl and indenyl radicals are important growth agents. Most of these reac-
tions are proposed only as global reactions so that further study is required for detailed theoretical analyses of the related elementary
reactions to provide more accurate and pressure-dependent product channels and rate constants. On the other hand, statistical methods
(i.e., kinetic Monte-Carlo) that allow PAHs to grow indefinitely by employing different classes of reactions in a jump manner [213–217] ,
may be more practical in the context of soot simulation. This will be discussed further in Section 2.3 on soot surface growth, as recent
models employ a chemical analogy [218] of soot with large PAHs, considering soot particles to be composed of stacks of PAHs and surface
growth can be described by PAH planar or spatial growth at edge sites.

2.2. Soot nucleation

Soot nucleation refers to the transition of gas-phase molecular soot precursors to condensed-phase carbon materials. According to
Frenklach [122] and many other researchers, this transition is probably the least known process of soot formation. Nevertheless, extensive
research in the last few decades has made it convincing that high molecular weight PAHs are the dominant −if not the sole −class of
molecular precursors for soot nucleation. The evidence includes transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of soot indicating ordered

mechanisms explaining how the first soot particles nucleate out of PAHs under flame conditions remain research in progress.

Various conceptually different pathways for soot nucleation have been suggested [18] and are briefly discussed here. More detailed
analysis can be found in the review by Wang [18] . The first pathway (with some variation in details) generally concerns the formation
and growth of fullerene-like structures. In the famous graphite laser vaporization experiments by Kroto et al. [220] in which Buckminister-
60 ) was observed with the increase in
fullerene (C
reaction residence time. The authors proposed that the consumption of these more reactive (compared to the remarkably stable C
60 ) large
carbon clusters are due to their interactions with the abundant small carbon species to form soot. It was further argued that, at typical
flame temperatures where dehydrogenation are favored, carbon tends to form stable spherical shells to satisfy the valence requirements
and curved PAHs with five-member rings can contribute to the generation of the spheroidal structures [221] . Based on this reasoning, an
icospiral mechanism was proposed in which the formation of soot is described as a consequence of faulty growth of fullerene. The error
during fullerene formation prevents cage closure, instead it leads to further molecular growth to onion-like structures [221,222] . Fig. 4 a
provides a schematic for this process. The icospiral mechanism suggests fullerenic structures to be precursors for soot, however, it should
be noted that although the authors wish to generalize soot formation in flame conditions, this mechanism was based on experiments
performed for a pure carbon system. Homann and coworkers [223–226] studied fullerene and soot formation in premixed flames using
MBMS with photon ionization and observed that whenever soot or fullerene are formed, negative ions, covering a continuous mass spec-
trum up to 20 0 0 amu, are present. Presumably, this indicates the presence of aromers (aromatic oligomers), which were assumed to be
products of PAH-PAH reactions [222,225] . It was further argued that aromers possess many five-member rings (to explain their electron
affinity) and have curved structures facilitating hydrogen loss, the features of which suggest their possible role as fullerene/soot precur-
sors [222] . Homann explained further that once aromers are formed, the conditions of flame temperature, pressure, and intermediate
species’ concentration will determine whether they continue to react with unsaturated hydrocarbons (e.g., C
2 ) to form soot or undergo
unimolecular reactions toward cage closure to form fullerene. In conventional combustion environments, where hydrocarbons are burned
in air (fuel rich) at atmospheric or elevated pressures, unsaturated small hydrocarbons are abundant, favoring soot formation [222] . The
pathway from aromers to soot is schematically shown in Fig. 4 b.

2 H

Another  nucleation  pathway  is  related  to  the  purely  chemical  growth  of  soot  nuclei  from  PAH  species.  D’Anna  and  coworkers
[125,215] proposed a growth mechanism in which PAHs chemically coalescence with each other to form three-dimensional, cross-linked,
ring-ring aromatic structures. With continuous mass and size growth of these structure, the properties of the condensed phase can finally
be acquired. This process can also be schematized by the following repetitive reaction sequences [125,215] :

In yet another pathway advocated by Frenklach and Wang [198] , soot nucleation was explained to occur through physical sticking of
PAHs. As the size of the aromatic species is increased beyond a certain critical value (via molecular chemical growth), they collide and
begin to stick together to form PAH dimers, which continue to collide with other PAH molecules to form trimers and so on. From energy
considerations, the most probable orientations for successful physical sticking are those leading to the formation of staked clusters. In this
way, the PAH stacks become increasingly larger and eventually assume the properties of solid particles.

It is probably safe to say that none of the above pathways pro-
vides a universal or consistent explanation for the soot nucleation
processes observed in different flame conditions. For instance, it
has been argued that, from a kinetic point of view, the rates of
the chemical reactions leading to fullerenic growth are too slow to
explain the observed time scale of soot inception in experiments
[198,228] . Also, experimental diffraction patterns of soot particles
were reported to suggest the presence of stacked turbostratic ben-
zenoid arrays (as opposed to the spiraling structure) [228] , which
were  also  supported  by  soot  images  taken  with  TEM  [229] .  Re-
cent measurements on soot particle sizes in premixed flames con-
firm the dominance of bimodal size distributions [4 8,4 9,230–233] ,
evidence against the icospiral nucleation pathway. The underlying
reasoning was provided by Wang [18] as follows: The solution of
the Smoluchowski coagulation equation with persistent source of
nucleation shows that the particle size distribution function would
quickly  evolve  into  a  unimodal  if  the  rate  of  nucleation  is  first
order  with  monomer  concentration  [18,234] ,  which  is  the  case
for icospiral nucleation mechanism. As a result, this disagreement
with  the  experiments  in  terms  of  size  distribution  excludes  the
icospiral mechanism to be the dominant pathway for soot nucle-
ation, at least for the premixed flame conditions investigated.

As previously mentioned, the PAH chemical coalescence path-
way has its limitations in accounting for persistent soot nucleation
in regions where the concentration of H radical is low. For molec-
ular growth reactions to occur between PAH species (R44) , one of
the PAH molecules must be activated to form aryl radical, which is
typically achieved through H-abstraction reaction involving H rad-
ical (R43) . As a result, it is expected that in the post-flame zone of
fuel-rich premixed flames (or the fuel side of non-premixed flames
where H radicals exist only in very low concentrations), the rates
of soot nucleation through chemical coalescence may be negligible.
However, experimental data provide evidence that soot nucleation
continues in such regions [230] , suggesting that other nucleation
mechanisms are responsible.

The  primary  issue  concerning  the  PAH  physical  dimerization
pathway  is  the  contradiction  between  the  need  for  large  PAHs
for dimer stability and the difficulty in forming these large PAH
molecules.  For  the  sticking  of  two  PAH  monomers  to  be  suc-
cessful in high temperature flame environments, the electrostatic
and  dispersive  binding  forces  must  be  strong  enough  to  coun-
teract  the  entropy  resistance  for  binding.  This  translates  to  the
fact that the colliding PAH monomers must reach a rather large
size if dimer formation is to be realized. A recent molecular dy-
namic  study  [235]  confirmed  that  PAH  dimer  stability  is  con-
trolled by monomer mass and solvent-accessible surface area, ac-
companied  by  the  discovery  that −in  the  case  of  heteromolecu-
lar  dimerization −dimer  stability  is  determined  primarily  by  the
size of the smaller monomer. Direct measurement of pyrene (four-
ring  PAH)  dimerization  rates  in  low  temperature  supersonic  jets
demonstrated  pyrene  dimerization,  which  is  frequently  modeled
for nucleation, cannot proceed to a significant level at flame tem-
peratures  [236] .  Similar  conclusions  were  reached  by  a  recent
molecular  dynamic  study,  showing  that  pyrene  dimerization  at
1500 K  is  almost  impossible  [237] .  It  was  further  estimated  that
a 3.6 bar partial pressure of pyrene is required for 1% pyrene to
be converted to dimers at 1500 K, while in practical hydrocarbon
flames, the volume fractions of pyrene are generally on the order
of 10 −6 . In fact, based on theoretically calculated binding energy
data [238–240] , assuming equilibrium kinetics, a size of circum-
18 ) is required for successful dimerization at typi-
coronene (C
cal flame temperatures [18] . Non-equilibrium effects were also dis-
cussed by Schuetz and Frenklach [241] , who performed molecular
dynamics simulation of pyrene dimerization with on-the-fly quan-
tum forces. They showed that a rovibrationally excited dimer can

be formed from two pyrene molecules with a lifetime significantly
longer than the collision time scale, exhibiting the possibility of
further chemical reactions leading to the formation of a covalent
bond  between  the  two  PAH  monomers.  An  unresolved  issue  of
these postulates is whether the excited dimer/initial clusters can
survive constant non-reactive collisions during their lifetimes.

On the other hand, experiments have shown that peak concen-
trations decrease exponentially for increasingly larger PAHs. For in-
stance, in a typical ethane counterflow diffusion flame [242] at at-
mospheric pressure with a benzene mole fraction on the order of
10 −4 , the mole fractions for the two-ring naphthalene and four-
ring pyrene dropped to 10 −5 and 10 −6 , respectively. In fact, it has
been pointed out that in typical sooting premixed flames, the con-
centrations of PAHs decreased by roughly one order of magnitude
with  the  growth  of  every  two  peri-condensed  rings  [18] .  There-
fore, it is expected that the concentrations of large PAHs (i.e., A
C

There  is  also  an  experimental  evidence  that  raises  questions
about nucleation from pyrene. Recent aerosol mass spectrometer
studies on extracted soot particles from a C
2 counterflow
diffusion flame showed that species with mass 202 amu (pyrene
or its isomers) contribute a very small fraction of the high-mass
species [136,137] . Even for the mass peak of 202 amu, the photo-
ionization efficiency curve (PIE, discussed later in the section on
experimental method) showed that it was most likely contributed
by isomers of pyrene, leading to the tentative conclusion that PAH
species other than the Stein stabilomers [135] may be important
for soot nucleation.

The  insufficiency  of  the  above  soot  nucleation  hypothesis  in
explaining  experimental  observations  motivates  the  investigation
of  additional  pathways  for  nascent  soot  formation;  several  re-
search  groups  have  made  significant  efforts  to  search  for  addi-
tional/alternative nucleation schemes. For example, through molec-
ular dynamics simulations, Violi and coworkers [243,244] showed
that the aliphatic chains attached to aromatic rings may be impor-
tant for facilitating the physical sticking of PAHs into clusters at
high temperatures, by accommodating the excessive collision en-
ergy into the additional internal vibrational modes of these side
chains.

Considering  the  experimental  observation  that,  in  addition  to
PAH  clusters  held  together  by  physical  forces,  aromatic  moieties
linked by chemical bonds are also present in high temperature re-
gion of a counterflow diffusion flame [89] , Mao et al. [245] pointed
out the potential importance of chemical nucleation for the forma-
tion of incipient soot formation. They investigated the soot nucle-
ation process from a pool of PAH molecules of various sizes us-
ing the reactive force-field (ReaxFF) molecular dynamic simulation,
which has the capability to account for both physical and chemi-
cal reactions. Results showed that at low temperatures, even PAHs
as small as naphthalene can nucleate into stacked structures via
physical interactions. Nevertheless, at typical temperatures in soot-
ing regions of hydrocarbon flames (i.e., ∼1600 K), physical sticking
of PAHs was not possible except for very large molecules (e.g., cir-
cumcoronene, A
19 ), which is consistent with the conclusion of Sab-
bah et al. [236] . With a further increase in temperature to above
2500 K, PAHs became chemically active through dehydrogenation
(i.e.,  formation  of  aryl  radicals).  Subsequent  PAH  fragmentation
produced polyacetylenic-like radicals or small molecules which fur-
ther contributed to molecular growth. Specifically, both PAH clus-
ters  connected  with  a  carbon  bridge  (i.e.,  a  covalent  bond  with
polyacetylenic chains) at the edge, and fullerenic structures were
observed.  This  study  essentially  supports  the  chemical  growth
pathway proposed by D’Anna and coworkers [125,215] . However,
the high temperature ( > 2500 K) required for H-abstraction through

dehydrogenation may not fully explain the ubiquitous soot forma-
tion at much lower temperatures ( ∼1500 K) [246,247] .

Motivated by the prediction that the zigzag edges of graphene,
or  finite-sized  graphenes,  contain  radical  characteristics  originat-
ing from localized π -electrons, Wang [18] pointed out the poten-
tial role of aromatic π -radicals in strengthening the binding in PAH
clusters. In a step forward, Zhang et al. [248] performed quantum
chemistry calculations to investigate the effects of π -electrons in
covalent bond formation during PAH dimerization. The bond na-
ture (i.e., number of bonds and sites for bonding) was systemati-
cally studied for dimerization of both identical and different rect-
angular  PAHs.  Their  results  confirmed  the  possibility  of  covalent
bonding,  and  that  the  radical  character  dictates  the  number  of
bonds formed, while the aromaticity of the individual six-member
ring determines the bond sites. This implies that bonding is more
likely  to  form  in  rings  with  the  largest  aromaticity.  It  must  be
pointed  out,  however,  the  discussion  of  Zhang  et  al.  [248]  was
based on a zero-temperature scenario, while at combustion rele-
vant temperatures the dimers formed were found to be thermo-
dynamically  unstable  [249] ,  primarily  due  to  the  large  decrease
of dimerization entropy. Nevertheless, the authors considered that
the lifetime of dimers may be longer than the molecular collision
time scale so that they, once formed, could still contribute to the
nucleation of soot particles. It remains to be proved whether these
unstable dimers can survive constant collisions from molecules of
other combustion gases.

The  role  of  cation- π in  enhancing  the  stability  of  PAH  clus-
ters, inspired by previous astrophysical studies in which the ex-
istence of PAHs in the interstellar medium [250–252] and the en-
hanced PAH binding by a metal cation [253,254] were discussed,
has recently drawn attention from researchers on soot. Recogniz-
ing  that  the  most  abundant  cations  in  hydrocarbon  flames  are
CHO + , C
3 O + resulting from chemi-ionization [255,256] ,
Chen and Wang [257] performed ab initio and density functional
theory calculations to investigate the binding energies and struc-
tures of complexes formed from the association of these chemi-
ions  and  1  to  4  ring  PAHs.  Their  results  showed  that  although
the cation- π interactions make a positive contribution, the cation-
enhanced  bindings  are  still  too  weak  to  account  for  soot  nucle-
ation from PAH clusters. However, similar studies on the interac-
tions between cations of transition metals and benzene molecules
[258,259]  have  shown  very  strong  binding  energies  among  the
complexes  M Z + (Bz) n ,  where  M z +  is  the  metal  cation  (i.e.,  Fe 2 + ,
Co 2 + , Cu 2 + ), Bz refers to benzene, and n is the number of benzene
molecules in the complex. Such enhanced binding strength indi-
cates the potential of M Z + (Bz) n to form the first soot nucleus [258] .
This is especially relevant considering many trace metals present
in practical hydrocarbon fuels, as well as in engine lubricating oils.
However, it must be pointed out that although theoretically plau-
sible, direct experimental evidence has yet to be produced for the
facilitation of M Z + (Bz) n in soot nucleation, despite the fact that the
effect of metal addition in soot formation was studied decades ago
[260] .  The  problem  is  complicated  because,  besides  its  potential
role  in  nucleation,  a  metal  additive  can  also  catalytically  reduce
the formation of molecular soot precursors [261,262] , enhance the
oxidation of soot once formed [45,261,263] , and suppress particle-
particle coagulation due to repulsive forces [260,264] .

More  recently,  Kraft  and  coworkers  [265,266]  noticed  that
curved PAHs (cPAH), with pentagonal ring integrated in their struc-
tures, are featured with significant molecular flexoelectric dipole
moments.  They  further  investigated  the  possibility  of  dipole-
induced homodimerization of cPAHs, only to find that the bind-
ing energy between cPAHs is comparable with or even lower than
that  of  planar  PAHs  [267] .  This  is  because  the  steric  effects  of
cPAHs caused a reduction in dispersion contribution, and thus can-
celled the effects of dipole-dipole interactions [267] . Nevertheless,

it was shown that cPAHs can bind strongly with chem-ions, the
interactions  between  which  are  long-ranged  and  can  be  signifi-
cant especially in combustion systems where concentrations of rel-
evant species are low [268] . The proposal that the interaction be-
tween  cPAHs  and  ions  may  play  an  important  role  in  soot  for-
mation [266,268] was also supported by recent experimental re-
sults that demonstrated enhanced physical clustering with cations
[54,269] . Nevertheless, further theoretical and experimental efforts
are needed to confirm this ion-induced nucleation mechanism.

From a modelling perspective, soot nucleation must be quan-
titatively accounted for in any predictive soot models because it
bridges the treatment of gas phase and surface reactions, in addi-
tion to serving as a turning point beyond which particle dynam-
ics is initiated. Historical treatments are largely empirical and in-
clude the one-step nucleation from C
2 [270] , as shown in R45 ,
and that from benzene in R46 [271] . Many modern soot inception
models follow the work of Frenklach and Wang [198] and describe
soot nucleation with irreversible [198] or reversible dimerization
[272]  of peri-condensed  aromatic species,  most notably pyrene
molecules. Although these models successfully explain many ex-
perimental observations, there has been compelling evidence sug-
gesting that these dimers, linked by physical forces, are not sta-
ble enough at flame temperature to accommodate further growth
[243] ,  and  that  chemical  bonds  between  monomers  are  essen-
tial  for  the  formation  of  stable  PAH  clusters.  The  main  chal-
lenges  for  current  chemical  nucleation  mechanisms,  mentioned
above,  are  that  they  involve  reactions  with  high-energy  barriers
(leading to slow reaction rates), which are not perfectly compat-
ible  with  certain  experimental  observations.  One  example  is  the
experimentally-observed  persistent  soot  nucleation  in  the  post-
flame  zone  of  rich  premixed  flames,  which  is  characterized  by
low temperature and low concentrations of reactive radicals (i.e.,
H atom).

Recently, a new nucleation mechanism, termed clustering of hy-
drocarbons by radical-chain reactions (CHRCR) was proposed by Jo-
hansson et al. [138] . The CHRCR mechanism highlights the impor-
tance of chain propagation of resonantly stabilized radicals (RSR).
In particular, the molecular growth process initiates with repeti-
tive additions of C
3 or
c-C
5 ), generating new RSRs with increasingly higher molecular
weights. These RSRs can subsequently cluster with different types
of hydrocarbons, including stable PAHs and unsaturated aliphatic
species,  while  preserving  the  radical  nature.  As  such,  molecular
growth can proceed without the need for high energy barrier ac-
tivation  reaction,  leading  finally  to  covalently-bonded  large  clus-
ters (incipient particles). In this way the CHRCR mechanism avoids
the challenges for existing chemical nucleation mechanisms. It also
overcomes the problem of insufficient concentration of large PAHs
because  RSRs  can  cluster  with  a  wide  range  of  different  hydro-
carbons [138] . The CHRCR mechanism was motivated partially by
experimental observations (through VUV-MS measurements) of a
class of increasingly larger RSRs in sooting flames. Note that the
chain propagation reactions involving RSRs has been confirmed by
quantum computations [138] . However, detailed rates for the var-
ious proposed radical chain propagation reactions still need to be
determined so that a complete mechanism can be assembled to
test the capabilities of the CHRCR mechanism in predicting the for-
mation of large molecular species and soot [273] .

2.3. Soot surface growth, particle coalescence, and agglomeration

Surface growth refers to the process in which gaseous species
attach to the surface of pre-existing soot particles, and their subse-
quent incorporation into the particulate phase [119,274] . It is gen-
erally believed that although inception is the first step for soot for-
mation,  providing  the  nucleus,  the  majority  of  soot  mass  comes
from surface growth [274] . For instance, the results of a numerical
simulation study on soot formation in ethylene/air coflow diffusion
flames [72] showed that the radially integrated soot mass growth
rate  from  surface  reactions  were  more  than  an  order  of  magni-
tude higher than from new particle inception. Similarly, Kennedy
[275] showed that more than 90% of the final soot volume is pro-
duced from surface growth in counterflow diffusion flames.

Although detailed physicochemical processes of surface growth
are  still  not  fully  understood,  semi-empirical  descriptions  of  its
rates  were  proposed  decades  ago,  initially  for  premixed  flames
[274,276] , and later for diffusion flames as well [277–279] . These
early studies generally showed a first-order kinetics with the gas
phase soot growth agent, for which acetylene was considered to
be a primary candidate [276] . The rate of the mass adding reac-
2 then took the simple form of
2 H
tion C
ω g = k ( T ) f ( S )[C
2 ], where ω g is the soot growth rate, k ( T ) is the
rate constant dependent on temperature, T , and f ( S ) is a function
of soot surface area [270] . The authors argued that because active
sites may decrease in concentration with the extent of soot growth
due to surface aging [119,129] , ω g  should not be directly propor-
tional to S . They went on to propose, ad hoc, that the number of
active sites is proportional to the square root of S , and the soot
growth rate can be written as:

where M
C is the molar weight of carbon, [C] is the molar concen-
tration of solid carbon, N is the number of particles per unit mix-
ture mass, and ρ
C  is the density of soot [270] . Later experimen-
tal  determination  of  mass  growth  rates  following  streamlines  in
coflow diffusion flames indicated that ω g was dependent on acety-
lene concentration raised to a power of n , slightly larger than unity
[277,279] . This difference, as compared to Eq. (1) , was thought to
be caused by soot oxidation (discussed in detail in a subsequent
section) which occurred during the experiment, thereby masking
the net soot growth rate [279] . After accounting for soot oxidation,
n was found to be close to unity [279] .

More physically based description of surface growth was stim-
ulated by the hypothesis of chemical similarity between soot par-
ticles and large PAHs that provided a possibility to treat surface
reactions  through  elemental  reactions  [122] .  In  this  regard,  the
surface  analogy  of  the  gas  phase  HACA  mechanism −that  is  the
surface-HACA  mechanism −was  proposed  to  describe  soot  mass
growth through the following reaction sequences [198,280] :

C soot –H + H → C soot · + H 2

C soot · + H → C soot – H

C soot · + C 2 H 2 → C soot –H + H

bon particle. The rate of hydrogen abstraction reaction (R47) can

In  addition  to  H  radical,  OH  [146,280] ,  CH

other hydrocarbon radicals, may also initiate hydrogen abstraction

surface-HACA  growth  mechanism,  emphasizing  the  roles  of  CH

C
3 in the surface site activation reactions to explain mea-
sured  soot  growth  rates  in  CDFs,  where  H  radical  concentration

A parameter α, having a physical representation of the fraction
of surface sites available for chemical reactions, was introduced by
Frenklach and Wang [198] to account for the surface aging of soot
particles. In principle, the extent of soot aging, and thus the value
of α ( ≤1), should depend on both particle size and soot surface
temperature [187] . By testing several different premixed flames, an
empirical correlation of α was proposed:

(cid:3)
α = tanh

where μ1 is the first moment of soot size distribution function and
a and b are linear functions of temperature, which could be de-
termined by matching with experiments. These expressions were
developed based on soot measurement data for premixed flames;
and  there  are  other  relations  that  were  used  for  different  flame
configurations [282,283] . The Arrhenius type expression of α = min
( c × exp ( d / T ), 1), in particular, was frequently used in coflow dif-
fusion  flames  [71,284] ,  where  c  and  d  are  fitting  constants.  The
value  of  α was  also  sometimes  assumed  to  be  a  constant,  for
example  in  a  previous  counterflow  flame  simulation  [78] ,  unity
value  was  used  and  a  much  smaller  constant  of  0.078  was  em-
ployed by Dworkin et al. [282] . Note also that in the surface-HACA
growth mechanism, the C
2 addition step (R49) was assumed to
be irreversible, motivated by the fact that the dependence of ther-
mal decomposition of the surface intermediates on flame temper-
ature would be overpredicted if reversible reaction was included
[122,198] . Nevertheless, the complete exclusion of reversibility then
underestimated the temperature dependence observed experimen-
tally and the inclusion of α can in a way be considered a remedy
[122] . A theoretical study was recently performed [285] to micro-
scopically investigate the surface properties of equilibrated pyrene
and  coronene  clusters  [239,286]  (as  a  representation  of  nascent
soot  particles),  demonstrating  a  decreasing  (increasing)  trend  of
surface availability with increased particle size (temperature). Note
that the relationship with temperature is different from the com-
mon concept of a decreasing α with the increase in temperature;
the authors explained this difference by pointing out that surface
availability is a local property, while α is a global property of the
soot ensemble. An upper limit of 0.8 ∼0.9 for α was also proposed
[285] ,  considering  the  pocket  surface  is  inaccessible  for  gaseous
species because of their shorter life time as compared to surface
reaction time.
Besides C

2 addition, the importance of PAH addition on par-
ticle surface in soot mass growth was also demonstrated [272,287–
289] .  A  modelling  study  on  soot  formation  in  a  high-pressure
coflow diffusion flame [72] showed that at pressures higher than
6 bar, the soot growth rate through PAH addition can even over-
take the surface-HACA growth rate. D’Anna et al. [290] also showed
that a physical mechanism such as PAH addition is more likely to
contribute to nanoparticle formation and growth in the pyrolytic
region of soot formation in CDF, where temperatures and H radical
concentration were relatively low.

2 H

From a first principle, the types and rates of reactions on soot
surfaces may depend on many parameters including temperature,
size, morphology, detailed chemical composition, type, and steric
confinements of reactive sites on the particles (note that the origi-
nal surface-HACA mechanism [198] considered only the armchair
site,  and  site  density  was  pre-specified,  while  surface  reactions

and agglomeration. Coalescence typically indicates the disappear-
ance  of  the  boundary  between  two  particles  in  contact,  result-
ing in a reduction of the total surface area; while agglomeration
refers to the sticking of particles with point contact (conserving
surface area). TEM images of nascent particles shows a spherical
shape; while mature soot particles generally have nearly spheri-
cal  primary  particles  collected  into  fractal  aggregates  with  vary-
ing numbers of primary particles [311,312] . The spherical nature of
the nascent/primary particles is probably a major motivation for an
early model [198] to treat particle coagulation as purely coalescent,
i.e., colliding particles merging to form a larger spherical particle.
However, later investigations [313–315] showed that sphericity can
also be attained by point-contact particle aggregation with simul-
taneous surface growth. Under conditions where colliding partners
were mostly small particles (in regions where soot inception rates
were high and newly incepted particles abundant), surface growth
effectively  smoothed  out  the  aggregates  towards  highly  spheri-
cal particles. On the other hand, in environments where colliding
partners were large (e.g. in the post-flame zone of rich premixed
flames), the smoothing effect of surface growth became relatively
less important and a chain-like fractal was more likely to result.

Nevertheless, coalescent growth is still highly likely for nascent
particles with liquid-like behavior. There is also experimental evi-
dence that under high temperature conditions ( > 1500 K), even ma-
ture chain-like soot aggregate can experience in-particle sintering,
and thus reduction of surface area and increased primary particle
size [316] . In a recent detailed soot model [317] , sintering was con-
sidered to be quasi-instantaneous for primary particles with a size
smaller than a critical value ( D
pp,crit ), while for larger particles, an
empirical model was used, with characteristic sintering time be-
tween two primary particles having an Arrhenius-type expression.
Complicated  surface  growth  and  particle-particle  interactions
would certainly result in poly-dispersed soot ensembles with com-
plex  particle  size  distributions  (PSD).  Recent  research  in  high-
fidelity  measurement  of  PSD  using  differential  mobility  analysis
(DMA) (see e.g., [49,52,54,97,318–321] , with a detailed discussion
provided by Wang [18] ) opened new possibilities for understand-
ing  the  above-described  processes  through  an  inverse  problem
[18,50,322,323] .  The  PAH-PP  soot  model  proposed  by  Kraft  and
coworkers [300,317] had several parameters, such as soot density,
smoothing factor, pre-exponential factor, activation energy of sin-
tering, and fractions of reactive sites, that were optimized by com-
parison  against  experimental  PSDs.  Through  analysis  of  the  PSD
data obtained from AFM and scattering measurements, D’Alessio et
al. [324] found that the sticking coefficient of coagulation (i.e., the
actual measured coagulation rate divided by the theoretical value
obtained from gas kinetic theory) for the nascent nanoscale organic
carbon  particle  (NOC,  < 3 nm)  was  orders  of  magnitude  smaller
than  the  larger  soot  particles.  Additional  PSD  measurements  us-
ing both DMA and AFM confirmed that small particles have less
propensity to coagulate at flame temperatures [325,326] . By com-
paring  the  measured  and  computed  PSD,  Sirignano  and  D’Anna
[219] further demonstrated that coagulation efficiency depends on
both particle size and temperature. Small particles had low coagu-
lation efficiency even at room temperature and they decreased fur-
ther with the increase in temperature. On the other hand, coagula-
tion efficiency for large particles did not have strong temperature
sensitivity and exhibited a high value for the entire temperature
range examined.

on other types of sites may also be possible [291] ). In addition,
more recent experimental investigations in premixed flames pro-
vide both direct (aerosol mass spectrometry, Fourier-transform in-
frared  (FTIR)  and  Raman  spectroscopy)  and  indirect  (TEM  and
atomic force microscope (AFM) [97] ) evidence for the existence of
aliphatic chains covering the aromatic core of nascent soot parti-
cles. These findings necessitate the description of mass growth re-
actions on different surface sites so that the chemical and struc-
tural details of soot particles must be tracked in soot models [18] .
Toward  this  goal,  and  considering  the  chemical  analogy  of  soot
with PAHs (as pioneered by Frenklach [218] ), Singh and Frenklach
[292]  and  Kraft  and  coworkers  [213,216,293]  differentiated soot
surface sites (as shown in Fig. 5 ) and developed detailed surface
mechanisms that take into consideration the different reactions on
the  various  sites.  In  addition  to  conventional  H  abstraction  and

bi-phenyl-like structures and so on. More details of the many sur-
face reaction classes can be found in Refs. [213,216,298,299] . These
reactions can be followed in detail for a single seed PAH molecule
(e.g., pyrene) using a Monte Carlo algorithm, resulting in the ki-
netic Monte Carlo aromatic site (KMC-ARS) model [216] , which can
specifically track the shape and chemical identity of the growing
PAH. Note that soot particles were modeled by Kraft and cowork-
ers [216,300] to be composed of planar PAHs, which contain bulk
carbon atoms and edge carbon atoms. It is on these edge atoms
(i.e., soot sites) that surface reaction can take place.

The  3-D  growth  of  PAH  structures  was  also  studied  by  Fren-
klach  and  coworkers  [292,299,301,302]  and  Violi  and  coworkers
[303–305] , partially motivated by the fact that the originally pla-
nar  PAH  structure  can  develop  curvatures  by  incorporating  five-
member  rings  [228] .  Evidence  was  provided  by  high  resolution
TEM (HRTEM) images which showed curved PAH lattices [306,307] .
The presence of curvature in PAHs have implications in terms of
soot inception, especially considering the potential interaction (yet
to be explored) between polar curved PAHs and chemi-ions [308] .
Particles  consisting  of  curved  PAH  lattices  are  also  shown  to  be
more  easily  oxidized  [309] ,  and  a  recent  soot  growth  model  by
Yapp et al. [310] managed to estimate PAH curvature with informa-
tion about the number of five- and six-member rings in the PAH
structure.

Although surface growth accounts for the majority of soot mass,
ultimate  particle  size  and  morphology  are  largely  influenced  by
particle-particle interactions (i.e., coagulation). Collisional interac-
tions between particles can be generally classified into coalescence

Soot oxidation is a process that counteracts soot growth and it
is also the primary mechanism for their removal from combustion
exhausts. Therefore, a mechanistic understanding of soot oxidation
is of both fundamental and practical importance. A comprehensive

review  of  early  experimental  and  kinetic  studies  on  soot  oxida-
tion (before 2001) was provided by Stanmore et al. [327] and a
recent informative account by Frenklach et al. [200] . It is generally
recognized that the most important soot oxidants are OH radical
and molecular O
2 O, CO
2
and NO
2 can be particularly important at
low temperatures under conditions like the regeneration of a diesel
particulate filter (DPF) [329,330] .

2 , with contributions also from O atom, H

2 [327,328] . Note that NO

At  high  temperature  flame  conditions,  OH  radicals  [331–
334]  are  particularly  effective  in  oxidizing  soot,  and  this  can  be
especially true in CDFs, where concentrations of molecular O
2  in
the sooting zone are relatively low. From a modeling perspective,
soot oxidation by OH was typically described by the collision of
a  soot  surface  site  (C soot -H)  with  OH  [198,280] ,  subject  to  colli-
sion efficiency that can be determined experimentally [334–337] .
A widely-used value of this collision efficiency is 0.13, as obtained
by Neoh et al. [334] as a lower bound value. D’Anna and cowork-
ers [214,215,338,339] also considered an activation energy for such
reactions, which was estimated from similar reactions for benzene
and PAHs. Although such relatively simple models have been suc-
cessful  in  predicting  experimental  flame  data,  recent  theoretical
studies [340–342] found that the reaction of OH + C soot -H (using
benzene as a prototype) does not lead to CO expulsion, and thus
was not considered to be a relevant soot oxidation pathway. In-
stead, OH reacting with armchair (oxidation more likely at arm-
chair site [343,344] ) soot surface radical site C soot · was shown to
form  various  oxy-radicals,  which  then  decomposed  to  eliminate
CO. Therefore, in a most  recent soot oxidation study  [200] , soot
oxidation by OH was considered to occur only through its reaction
with reactive radical surface sites.

Soot oxidation was recently studied in an environmental TEM
2 ,
[345] .  Although  the  feeding  gaseous  reactant  was  molecular  O
the high-energy electron beam of the TEM was seen to be very ef-
fective in ionizing O
2 molecules. It was thus expected that the ac-
tive soot oxidants were in fact radicals such as O atom or ion. The
results confirmed that a d 2 -law also holds for surface oxidation of
primary soot particles, regardless of their location inside the soot
aggregate. The study also provided clear evidence of both the inter-
nal and surface burning modes of soot particles, confirming previ-
ous findings using conventional TEM images [346–348] . For mature
particles with a thick graphite shell [349] , surface oxidation domi-
nates as it would be difficult for oxygen to diffuse across the outer
shell into the core of the particles. These experimental results are
believed to be helpful to model developments for soot oxidation.

Soot oxidation by molecular O

2 as a single step: C soot · + O

2  has recently attracted signifi-
cant research attention [292,345,350–361] , motivated at least par-
tially by the issue of DPF regeneration. Early models described soot
2 → products, with rate
oxidation by O
coefficients taken by chemical analogy to the reaction of phenyl
radical with O
2 [280] , later updated using rates calculated for O
2
oxidation of pyrene radical (4-pyrenyl) to form phenanthrene rad-
ical (4-phenanthryl) [293] . However, this updated rate [293] was
noted  to  be  slow  [362]  so  that  additional  detailed  mechanistic
studies were performed and results analyzed to identify more fa-
vorable oxidation pathways [351,363,364] . Sendt and Haynes [365–
2  addition on different types of surface sites,
367] investigated O
providing understanding of the mechanism on O
2 –surface sites in-
teractions. In their studies, however, multiple adjacent radical sites
were involved, which may exist only in exceedingly small concen-
trations considering the fraction of radical sites among surface sites
were already low (10 −2 to 10 −4 ). In this regard, Raj and coworkers
used quantum calculations to re-examine reaction pathways of O
2
oxidation at free-edge [362] and zig-zag edge sites [368] . Only one
radical site was present in the model reactant, and the computed
reaction pathways and high-pressure limit rate constants were pro-
vided for potential incorporation into detailed soot models.

Two  prominent  phenomena  with  respect  to  soot  burnout  in
oxygen-containing environments have been observed experimen-
tally: (1) Particles containing curved PAH structures oxidize notably
faster than those composed of planar PAHs [309,359,369] and (2)
Soot oxidation reactivity tends to decrease as oxidation progresses
[370] . Interestingly enough, as explained by Singh and Frenklach
[292] , both these enhanced and reduced soot oxidation reactivity
can  be  explained  by  the  presence  of  five-member  rings  in  soot
structures. On one hand, quantum calculations showed that acti-
vation energy for the oxidation of curved PAH (represented by 1-
corannulenyl radical with a five-member ring in the center) is no-
tably lower than that of planar PAH (represented by 4-pyrenyl rad-
ical)  [359] .  Sterically-resolved  kinetic  Monte  Carlo  simulation  on
large  graphene  sheets  also  confirmed  that  the  oxidation  rate  of
the curved PAH substrate was faster than planar ones, especially
during the initial stage of oxidation [200] . The underlying mecha-
nism was further identified: Curved PAH substrate tends to form a
larger number of sites with edge five-member rings that can po-
tentially desorb to expel carbon into the gas phase (i.e., not due
to actual oxidation reactions) [292] . On the other hand, as oxida-
tion progresses, many five-member rings at armchair sites accumu-
lated, due to oxyradical decomposition. These five-member rings
then formed zig-zag edges, which tends to decrease soot reactiv-
ity [292,350] . To summarize, the detailed work of Singh and Fren-
klach [292] confirmed that the effects of the five-member ring on
soot oxidation depends on their position in the graphene substrate,
emphasizing the importance of sterically-resolved simulations.

In  addition  to  the  reaction  between  oxygen  and  radical  sur-
face sites, the possibility of O
2 reacting with saturated C soot -H sites
was also investigated [200] . It was found that the possible reaction
channel is for O
2 . Neverthe-
less, the activation energy of such a reaction is high, making it less
favorable than the oxidation at radical sites [200] .

2 to abstract the H radical, forming HO

Soot fragmentation can be thought of as a reverse process of
coalescence  and  agglomeration.  Fragmentation  can  occur  during
thermal treatment of aggregated particles in an inert environment
[371] ,  but  are  more  likely  to  happen  during  the  oxidation  pro-
cesses. As discussed by Sirignano et al. [372] , two types of frag-
mentation are possible: The first has to do with the fragmentation
of large aggregates into smaller ones, or into isolated primary par-
ticles (i.e., aggregate fragmentation, reverse process of agglomer-
ation); The second type is the fragmentation of primary particles
into even smaller ones (i.e., particle fragmentation, reverse process
of coalescence).

Aggregate fragmentation occurs when oxidative material are re-
moved at the contact points linking primary particles; particle frag-
mentation is related to the internal structure of an individual parti-
cle [372] . Evidences for both types have been observed in different
configurations such as two-stage burners [355–358] , coflow [373] ,
and counterflow diffusion flames [372] . Visual tracking of a par-
ticular single aggregate in an environmental TEM provided direct
confirmation that the thickness of the bridge connecting primary
particles is continuously reduced by oxidation before breakup, re-
leasing two smaller aggregates [345] . These results show that frag-
mentation is an integral process of soot evolution and its accurate
description is important if particle morphology, average sizes −and
especially size distributions [374] −are to be accurately predicted
for soot particles experiencing oxidation.

2 O and CO

Due to the scope of the present review, oxidation of soot by
NOx, H
2 will not be discussed further; interested read-
ers may find relevant information elsewhere [329] . It is, however,
relevant to note, as Frenklach et al. mentioned in a recent publica-
tion [200] , that soot oxidation chemistry is very rich and could be
even more complicated than soot growth. As such, it is clear that
more experimental and numerical work is needed for the develop-
ment of predictive models of soot oxidation (and associated frag-

mentation) which will account for sterically-resolved surface reac-
tions, effects of particle nanostructures, and direct coupling of the
surface and gas phase environments.

2.5. Models of soot formation

With the above subsection providing physicochemical descrip-
tions  of  soot  formation  processes,  we  intend  to  present  an
overview  in  this  subsection  on  how  these  processes  are  numer-
ically  modeled.  In  fact,  some  modelling  perspective  has  already
been given, but here we will focus more on the numerical tech-
niques  used  to  deal  with  particle  dynamics.  Historical  develop-
ments  of  soot  models  can  be  found  in  the  review  by  Kennedy
[120] .

In many recent models for soot formation, soot inception was
modelled  as  the  physical  collision  of  large  PAHs  such  as  pyrene
[282,375–377] , or an ensemble of larger aromatics up to coronene
[111,140,378] .  In  these  studies,  nucleation  reactions  were  gener-
ally assumed to be irreversible with zero activation energy [198] .
Recently,  reversibility  of  the  inception  process  was  considered
[288,289,379] ,  and  statistical  mechanics  were  employed  to  de-
termine  the  enthalpy  and  entropy  of  the  PAH  dimerization  pro-
cesses, through which equilibrium constants and reverse rate coef-
ficients for soot nucleation reactions can be evaluated. The growth
from gas-phase to nanoparticles was modeled as a purely chem-
ical  growth  process  in  Refs.  [136,137,217,304,380,381] .  The  rele-
vant model such as Atomistic Model for Particle Inception (AMPI)
model  [304,380]  and  Stochastic  Nanoparticle  Simulator  (SNAPS)
[136,137,217,381]  were  shown  to  correctly  predict  the  order  of
magnitude of the nascent particle concentration.

Once incepted, nascent soot particles will experience surface re-
actions and particle-particle interactions, and their sizes and mor-
phology  will  change.  For  the  model  of  these  processes,  a  parti-
cle population balance equation needs to be solved, which can be
written generally as:

d N i

i  is  the  number  density  of  particle  of  size  i.  β ( i,  j )  is
where  N
the collision kernel between particles with sizes i and j . The first
two terms on the right-hand side are respectively the source and
sink terms due to coagulation process. Note the specific form of
the collision frequency depends on the coagulation regime (free-
molecular,  continuum,  and  transition),  which  is  characterized  by
the Knudsen number, K n = 2 λ
f  is the mean free path
for the gas-phase and d is the particle diameter. β ( i, j ) is a non-
liner function of the sizes of the colliding particles, and it is quite
difficult to find a closed-form solution for Eq. (3) . In this regard,
several  approximate  numerical  techniques  such  as  Monte  Carlo
(MC) method, method of moments and discrete sectional method
have been proposed.

f / d , where λ

Monte Carlo (MC) based models [382–384] could provide accu-
rate results by tracking the evolution of number density through
an  assemble  of  particles  governed  by  stochastic  processes  [382] .
Nevertheless, these simulations are computationally demanding so
that their applicability has so far been limited to simple config-
urations such as zero-dimensional reactors [385] . In contrast, the
other deterministic models including method of moments and sec-
tional method have been successfully applied to more challenging
multi-dimensional environments.

For the method of moments (MoM), the detailed description of
particle dynamics (i.e. Eq. (3) ) is reformulated in terms of the mo-
ments of particle size distribution function (PSDF). Specifically, the

r th moment M r is defined as [386] :

Numerical  scheme  such  as  the  interpolative  closure  or  vari-
ants of the quadrature method (see Ref. [375] and the references
therein) is necessary to close the system of equations for the mo-
ments. Following the work of Guo et al. [387] , the one-dimensional
transport equations for the r th moment can be written as:

where x denotes the Cartesian coordinate, ρ and u are the density

soot particles, D p, 1 is the diffusion coefficient for the smallest soot
r −2/3 is the fractional moments obtained by interpolation
particle. M
between integer moments.   ̇ M r  is the source terms due to nucle-
ation, coagulation, surface reaction (including oxidation), and PAH
addition. Similar to the coagulation term, the other source terms
are also needed to be rewritten in terms of soot moments [386] ,
and they generally involve fractional moments.

In principle, a knowledge of all these moments is equivalent to
a knowledge of PSDF itself [386] . However, in most cases the in-
terested soot properties can be adequately represented by a finite
number of moments (e.g., the first three or six moments). For ex-
ample, the overall number of particles can be represented by the
zeroth moment, M
0 ; the total volume of particles is the first mo-
ment M
1 (i.e. soot mass) divided by soot particle density; the av-
erage diameters of the particle ensemble can be derived from the
0 . As a result, the method of moments
ratio of for example, M
could  provide  many  expected  soot  properties,  and  in  the  mean-
while, keep the computational cost at a relatively low level. There-
fore, it has been widely employed to compute soot particle dynam-
ics of both laminar [122,140,198,280,375,386,388–391] and turbu-
lent flames [392–394] .

1 / M

Discrete sectional method [56,214,282,338,376,379,395–400] is
another widely used method to approximate the population bal-
ance  equation.  In  sectional  method,  the  continuous  size  distri-
bution  was  discretized  by  a  finite  number  of  sections  (or  bins).
Each section has a representative particle size (or mass) and the
mass/volume ratio of two consecutive sections is described by a
constant spacing factor. It is obvious that the PSD can be resolved
more accurately if more sections are used. In reality, the choice of
section number depends on the tradeoff between the approxima-
tion accuracy and computational cost.

The solution for population balance equation with the sectional
method  is  straightforward, since  the  prescribed sizes  i  and j  di-
rectly correspond to representative particles for the sections. Simi-
larly, the one-dimensional transport equation for the particle num-
i ) in each section can be derived as:

where  D
soot,i  is  the  diffusion  coefficient  of  soot  particle  in  sec-
tion i . Note the Brownian diffusion of soot particles is relatively
weak and in some cases its effects on particle transport can be ne-
glected [401] .   ̇ ω
soot,i is the soot source term for section i including
nucleation, coagulation, and heterogeneous soot surface processes.
Incipient  soot  particles  due  to  nucleation  reside  in  the  first  few
sections. Through coagulation or surface growth, particles in lower
section can move to higher sections. On the other hand, particles
in higher sections can move to lower sections by oxidation.

It  is  noted  that  Eq.  (9)  assumes  that  all  soot  particles
are  spherical  (i.e.,  without  considering  the  aggregate  struc-
tures).  This  assumption  was  preferred  in  several  soot  models
[56,214,378,379,397,398]  due partly to  its low computation cost.
If  the  soot  aggregation  was  considered  [282,396,402–404] ,  addi-
tional transport equation for the primary particle number density
is required. In addition, additional assumptions are necessary. Fre-
quently, it is assumed that all aggregates are comprised of equal-
sized spherical primary particles, and they also have the same frac-
tal  dimension  D
f  of  1.8,  while  smaller  primary  particles  are  as-
sumed to be dense spheres with D

f of 3.0.

Kinetics  describing  the  heterogeneous  soot  surface  processes
(i.e.  surface  growth,  oxidation  and  condensation)  are  similar  for
both the method of moments and the sectional method, although
the specific implementation is different. As mentioned previously,
the soot surface growth model is mostly based on the HACA soot
surface  reaction  scheme  developed  by  Frenklach  and  coworkers
[198,280] . The kinetics of the surface reactions are described us-
ing  the  concept  of  soot  surface  site  (Csoot-H).  The  modeling  of
soot oxidation by OH is based on the kinetic theory and a widely-
used value of this collision efficiency is 0.13. Soot oxidation rate
by O
2 can be calculated based on the concept of soot surface site,
similar to the modeling of HACA kinetics. PAH addition rate can
be modelled based on the collision rate between large aromatics
molecules  (such  as  pyrene)  and  soot  particles.  Note  that  unlike
chemical  growth  reactions,  which  require  surface  sites,  PAH  ad-
dition can be regarded as a physical process such that the rates
are independent on the concentration of surface species. As not all
collisions lead to condensation, a collision efficiency was generally
implemented to represent the probability of a successful addition
of the PAH onto the soot particle surface.

We  finally  pointed  out  the  importance  of  more  recently-
proposed sterically-resolved particle surface reaction modelling, as
discussed in Section 2.3 .

3. Experimental techniques for soot related measurements

Experimental determination for the concentrations of soot re-
lated gas- and condensed-phase species are of central importance
in soot mechanism studies. Experimentation not only provides the
data  to  validate  soot  models  but  is  also  a  source  for  new  in-
sight  into  soot  formation.  As  a  comprehensive  understanding  of
soot-related  diagnostic  methods −including  their  advantages  and
limitations −is  necessary  for  full  appreciation  of  the  experimen-
tal data, we provide in this section a brief overview of the most
widely-used experimental techniques.

3.1. Measurements of gas-phase species

3.1.1. Gas chromatography

Gas chromatography (GC) is a major technique for separating
individual gaseous compounds from their complex mixtures. The
most important part of a gas chromatograph is a specially coated

long column through which a mixture is separated. Inside this col-
umn, gaseous compounds (mobile phase) interact with the inner
coating of the column wall (stationary phase). These interactions
are  dependent  on  the  physical  properties  of  individual  gaseous
components;  therefore,  different  compounds  elute  from  the  col-
umn after different retention times, leading to mixture separation.
Additional sensors are required to detect and quantify the eluate,
and those widely used for combustion products are the flame ion-
ization detector (FID) for hydrocarbons, and thermal conductivity
detector (TCD) for H
2 and other non-combustible
gases. In many cases, a mass spectrometer (MS) is also used as a
highly effective detector, comprising a GC–MS system.

Fig.  6  shows  an  example  of  a  GC  setup  used  by  Gomez  and
coworkers [80] for the speciation of gas samples from counterflow
flames. As can be seen, this particular setup adopts three paral-
lel  columns  connected  to  different  detectors.  The  TCD  was  used
to quantify N
2 , which are present as large fractions of the
sample. The FID was employed for the quantification of hydrocar-
bons as well as CO and CO
2 , with the help of an upstream meth-
anizer. The identification of the species was achieved by checking
the molecule-specific mass spectrum.

2 and O

A GC analysis requires probe sampling; therefore, it is an intru-
sive measurement. Probe disturbance is inevitable and needs to be
considered, especially for small laboratory flames. The nozzle inner
diameter of a typical microprobe used for product extractions is
on the order of 100 μm [80,242,405,406] . Although this size seems
small, the presence of the probe can still cause the species spatial
profile to shift up to several millimeters. In addition, special care
must be given when measuring soot-laden flames since the small
nozzle can potentially become clogged by particles. Another major
drawback of GC analysis is that it may take up to several hours for
all the species of interests to elute from the column, especially for
large molecular species. This means that the GC method is an in-
herently off-line technique so that detection of short-lived radicals
is impossible. As typically performed by Jahangirian et al. [80] and
can be seen in Fig. 6 , gas samples, after being extracted from var-
ious locations of a flame, were stored in a set of sample loops to
be analyzed overnight. If the species of interest include those with
high  boiling  points  (such  as  PAHs),  the  probe,  the  sample  lines,
and the storage loops must be heated to avoid condensation [407] .
In such cases, it is necessary to determine whether thermal aging
can cause variation in the species concentration. The condensation
problem also put an additional limit on the maximum molecular
weight that can be analyzed by GC.

3.1.2. Mass spectrometry

A mass spectrometer (MS) identifies different chemical species
by ionizing neutral molecules and measuring the mass-to-charge
ratios. In addition to use as a detector in a GC-MS system, a MS can
also be used separately for combustion speciation, provided suit-
able sampling and ionization techniques are employed. Perhaps the
most popular sample introduction method is through molecular-
beam (MB) [408,409] ; its application in combustion diagnostics has
been  periodically  reviewed  by  Biordi  [410] ,  Westmoreland  et  al.
[411] , Hansen  et  al.  [172] ,  and  Qi  [412] .  Fig.  7  shows  an  experi-
mental setup used by Skeen et al. [413] for the chemical speciation
of  counterflow  diffusion  flames  using  molecular  beam  sampling.
As  can  be  seen,  the  apparatus  mainly  consists  of  a  counterflow
burner enclosed in a low-pressure chamber, a double-stage pump-
ing flame-sampling system, and a time-of-flight mass spectrome-
ter. An important advantage of the MBMS technique is its ability
to preserve radicals in a molecular beam for further MS detection.
Nevertheless, it is still noteworthy to point out that MB sampling,
as an intrusive diagnostic method, is not used directly to sample
the counterflow flames, but the material extracted from the flames
via a quartz millimeter-sized probe.

After  the  formation  of  a  molecular  beam,  neutral  atoms  or
molecules must be ionized before they can be sorted and identi-
fied based on their mass-to-charge ratios. Various ionization meth-
ods  have  been  developed,  among  which  electron  ionization  (EI),
laser-based photoionization, and synchrotron VUV photoionization
are the most widely-used in combustion research. EI is based on
the bombardment of high energy electrons to molecules in pro-
ducing ions. EI cross-sections are a strong function of electron en-
ergy, with rather low values near the ionization threshold for most
species.  Therefore,  for  strong  signals  the  electron  energy  is  fre-
quently set at a level much higher than the typical ionization en-
ergy threshold for combustion species (around 70 eV, as the max-
imum ionization cross-sections occur at this energy level). Unfor-
tunately, these energetic electrons can cause significant fragmen-
tation  of  the  parent  molecules.  If  the  sample  is  a  single  com-
pound, the fragmentation pattern produced provides a signature of
its molecular structure and thus is helpful for the structural de-
termination of unknown species. However, if the sample is a com-
plex mixture, the fragmentation may cause significant difficulties
in deconvoluting individual species, if not making the process com-
pletely impossible. In this regard, MS with EI is thought to be more
suitable for use as a detector for GC-MS systems where the mix-
tures are separated before entering MS.

To minimize or avoid fragmentation, ionizing sources with wide
tunability (in the range of ionization energy of combustion relevant
species, typically 7 −16 eV) and high energy resolution are required.
Synchrotron radiation in the VUV regime has been proven to be
an ideal ionization source [412] . The photon energy can easily be
tuned to just above the threshold ionization energy of most com-
bustion intermediates so that the neutral molecules/atoms/radicals
can be ionized (single-photon ionization) without significant frag-
mentation, resulting in much cleaner mass spectra for easy analy-
sis. Furthermore, by recording the mass spectra of a certain species
at different photon energies, a PIE spectrum can be obtained. The
information about ionization energy contained in a PIE spectrum
allows  unknown  species  to  be  identified  by  comparison  against
values  in  the  literature  or  obtained  from  quantum  computation.
Since most isomers have different ionization energy, a PIE provides
an effective way to distinguish isomers. Prominent examples are

With all its advantages, synchrotron radiation is only accessi-

combustion speciation is extremely limited. As an alternative, VUV
lasers can also be used for single-photon photoionization, although
these laser-based methods suffer from two major drawbacks: (1)
The photon energy is either fixed or inconvenient to tune and (2)
Typical maximum photon energy is not enough to ionize species
with  high  ionization  energies.  Bermudez  and  Pfefferle  [415]  fre-
quency tripled the third harmonic of a Nd-YAG laser in a xeon cell
to produce a VUV beam at 118 nm (i.e., photon energy of 10.5 eV),

However, major combustion products, and most C
2  species, have
ionization energy above 10.5 eV and thus cannot be photoionized.
To achieve tunability, a four wave sum-difference frequency gener-
ation in a krypton cell can be used, which typically requires two
dye lasers and has been shown to produce broadly tunable VUV
radiation with photon energy between 6.2 and 10.3 eV [417] . This
technique has been successfully used by Qi and McIlroy [418] and
Werner and Cool [419,420] for combustion speciation.

In  addition  to  single-photon  ionization,  resonance-enhanced
multi-photon  ionization  (REMPI)  has  also  been  used  in  MBMS
measurements [421–423] . REMPI involves the process of resonant
multi-photon (typically 1 or 2) absorption by a molecule or atom
to  reach  an  intermediate  Rydberg  state,  followed  by  additional
photon absorption that leads to ionization. The signature vibronic
transitions of individual species, together with the photon energy
tunability of dye lasers, provides species selectivity. Even in cases
where there is  an  absorption energy  band overlap so  that  more
than one species can be ionized with the same laser wavelength,
the produced ion mass may be different; thus the combination of
MS and REMPI offers the possibility for two-dimensional analysis.
When the excitation photons and the ionizing photon are of dif-
ferent  energies,  two-color  REMPI  provides  an  additional  method
if the conventional, one-color REMPI technique is insufficient for
species  selectivity.  In  fact,  REMPI-MS  is  both  mass-selective  and
isomer-selective, due to the fact that isomers with different molec-
ular structures have different spectroscopic features. It is believed
to be especially suited for selectively ionizing and measuring aro-
matic  species  [424–428] .  It  is,  however,  worthwhile  to  mention
that, ideally, the samples should be supersonically jet-cooled to an
ultra-low rotational temperature (i.e., tens of Kelvins) before being
photon-ionized, in order to reduce the broadening of energy levels
which are detrimental to REMPI energy selectivity. Fortunately, this
can be achieved by molecular beam sampling, although care must
be taken when sampling high temperature combustion products at
low pressures.

A notable advantage of REMPI, as compared to tunable laser-
based VUV, is that the beam can be more easily obtained via a
single dye-laser in the comfortable UV regime. The drawbacks of
REMPI-MS are: (1) Many necessary spectroscopic data (i.e., energy
bands, excitation cross-sections, ionization cross-sections, and etc.)
are not readily available [123] ; (2) Significant experimental time
is required as the photon energy (i.e., the laser wavelength) must
be changed [123] , and related calibration must be performed (ide-
ally) for each species of  interest; and (3) Its application is typi-
cally limited to small and medium-sized aromatic species [412] . To
summarize, of the above three different ionization methods, EI is
universal  but  not  selective,  REMPI  is  selective  but  not  universal,
and tunable VUV is both universal and selective. It is important
to mention, however, that REMPI combined with MBMS is proba-
bly the method of choice [127] for quantitative PAH measurements,
due to the sensitivity enhancement from resonance, which is espe-
cially important for species with ultra-low concentrations such as
PAHs.

3.1.3. Optically-based in-situ methods

Both GC and MS techniques are intrusive techniques, thus they
share  the  disadvantages  of  flame  perturbations.  The  presence  of
the  probe  may  affect  the  temperature/concentrations  profile  as
well as the flow field [429] . On the other hand, laser-based optical
methods can provide an in-situ determination of species concen-
trations from unperturbed (in most cases) flames.

Species-selective laser-based combustion diagnostic techniques
primarily  include  laser  absorption  spectroscopy  (LAS)  [430,431] ,
laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) [432] , and Raman scattering. Ex-
cellent books and reviews for these methods are available in the
literature [430,431,433] ; here only a brief introduction is offered.

A molecule with dipole moment can absorb photons that have
energy resonant with the spacing between two of its different ro-
vibrational  states,  which  are  the  signatures  of  individual  species
(thus  species-selective ).  The  extent  of  absorption  is  proportional
to  the  number  concentrations  of  the  absorbing  species,  through
the  Beer–Lambert  law,  I = I
0  are  the
transmitted and incident beam intensities, respectively; ηλ is the
spectral  absorption  coefficients  and,  L  is  the  path  length.  For  a
spectrally-isolated transition, ηλ can be written as:
ηλ = s ( T ) × φ ( λ) × P i
where s ( T ) is the temperature-dependent transition line strength,
φ( λ) is the line shape function depending on thermodynamic con-
ditions, and P
i  is the partial pressure (thus mole fraction) of the
probed species. Detailed expressions for s ( T ) and φ( λ) can be found
in  Ref.  [434] .  For  large  molecular  species  that  do  not  present
a  spectrally-resolved  rotational  transition,  the  overall  absorption
cross-section ( σ
ηλ = σ
abs × N i

abs ) can be used:

(10)

(11)

i  is  the  molecule  number  concentration.  Although  Eq.
where  N
(11) appears to be simpler, σ
abs must be experimentally calibrated
for a specific gas under specific thermodynamic conditions, and an
extrapolative extension to experimentally uncovered conditions is
very difficult [430] .

LAS  is  mostly  conducted  in  the  infrared  spectrum  since  ro-
vibrational  transitions  typically  involve  energy  differences  cor-
responding  to  photons  in  the  near-mid  infrared  regime.  Since
each species has specific signature transitions, tunable diode laser
source is generally the workhorse for LAS, providing wavelength
tunability  to  be  resonant  with  such  transitions,  hence  the  term
tunable  diode  laser  absorption  spectroscopy  (TDLAS).  LAS  is  espe-
cially suitable for quantitative determination of species mole frac-
tions in 0D shock tubes, 1D laminar flat premixed flames and ax-
isymmetric 2D coflow and counterflow flames. Under such condi-
tions, the local absorption coefficients ( ηλ) along the line-of-sight
are either uniform or can be obtained through simple tomographic
inversion.  For  unsteady  multi-dimensional  conditions  which  are
predominant in practical combustion devices, the line-of-sight fea-
ture of LAS becomes a major limitation for its application.

In combustion environments where many intermediates coex-
ist, the species to be quantified typically needs to have signature
transitions (at high temperatures) that are interference-free from
other  species.  Large  molecules  tend  to  have  very  complex  and
broad  absorption  spectra  and  will  therefore  likely  interfere  with
other species. As a result, quantifiable species quantification with
LAS is most frequently done for small molecules or radicals such
as CO, CO
4 . Nevertheless, if inter-
ference can be suitably taken care of or if qualitative monitoring
is targeted, measurements using LAS can be extended to practical
combustion conditions for larger molecules such as n-heptane, iso-
octane, and methyl-cyclohexane [435] .

Another concern for TDLAS is the lower limit for detection. If
the absorbance level is too low (either due to the low concentra-
tion of probed species or its low line strength), light absorption
could  be  too  weak,  which  may  adversely  affect  the  accuracy  of
measurements. In this regard, technical approaches are available to
increase the path length, or cavity ringdown spectroscopy (CRDS)
can be applied, which is based on the idea to reflect the laser beam
back and forth inside the cavity bounded by two highly reflecting
mirrors [436] . Typical mid-IR laser sources are tunable only in a
relatively narrow wavelength range. Therefore, multiple lasers are
required if more than one species specific need to be measured.
We  quote  recent  studies  using  TDLAS  to  measure  C
2  concen-
tration formed during the pyrolysis of ethylene and benzene in a
shock tube [39] , and to measure temperature via CO
2 absorption in
sooting ethylene coflow diffusion flames [437] to demonstrate the
potential of this method in quantifying important soot precursors
as well as temperature under sooting conditions.

Laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) is a process in which the target
molecule/radical is excited to a higher energy state after absorbing
one or more (typically two) photons, and subsequently returned to
the ground state by spontaneous emissions of photons (i.e., fluores-
cence). Qualitatively, species selectivity can be obtained by tuning
the laser wavelength to be resonant with the target species. Quan-
titatively, the fluorescence intensity is proportional to the number
concentrations of the probing species. A notable advantage of LIF
as compared to LAS is spatial resolution: LIF is a point-based (as
opposed to line-of-sight based) measurement with signals typically
detected perpendicular to the incident laser beam. In addition, LIF
can be configured to measure species concentration distribution in
a 2D plane (planar LIF), by manipulating the excitation laser beam
to form a light sheet and using an intensified charge-coupled de-
vice (ICCD) camera as a fluorescence signal detector.

Unlike LAS, LIF typically involves electronic transitions of target
species so that lasers in the UV–Vis spectrum are used as sources
of  excitation  (electronic state  transitions have energy  differences
corresponding  to  photons  in  the  UV–Vis  spectrum).  In  combus-
tion studies, OH, CH, H radicals and NO and CO molecules are fre-
quently measured with LIF. Note, however, due to the uncertainties
in fluorescence quenching processes and the fluctuations of laser
energies,  quantitative  determination  can  be  challenging  even  for
these small species. On the other hand, LIF is especially suitable
for qualitatively tracking the spatial distribution and temporal evo-
lution of flame front (as marked by CH or OH). By seeding fluores-
cent tracers (i.e., acetone), LIF is also frequently used to visualize
the mixing process of two streams.

In  addition,  LIF  is  used  to  measure  PAH  concentration  in  a
qualitative  manner.  PAHs  have  somewhat  complicated  molecular
structures  and  thus  have  fluorescence  with  broad  and  complex
spectrum (further complicated because both temperature and sur-
rounding  atmosphere  would  considerably  alter  the  spectra).  In
flame environments, the detected signals always represent the flu-
orescence of a mixture of PAH species, making quantitative decon-
volution  highly  challenging,  if  not  entirely  impossible.  Neverthe-
less,  it  has  been  shown  that  larger  PAHs  are  better  represented
by LIF signals detected at longer wavelengths [438–440] so that a
spectrally-resolved LIF signal can be used to qualitatively differen-
tiate between small and large PAHs. The signal intensity can also
be used to qualitatively evaluate the concentrations of these differ-
ent classes of PAHs. This method is particularly useful in evaluating
fuel effects on PAH formation by comparing the relative concentra-
tions of PAHs as represented by LIF signal intensity among flames
with different fuels or fuel additives [4 41–4 47] . Nevertheless, it is
important to note that PAH LIF signal can be highly dependent on
temperature [448] . As a result, quantitative comparisons of PAH LIF
signals can be performed only when the temperature is the same,
and care should be taken when evaluating LIF signals measured in

areas with significantly different local temperatures. Furthermore,
as  mentioned  above,  many  different  PAH  species  can  coexist  in
flame  conditions.  The  fluorescence  spectra  of  these  PAH  species
are not only complex and broad, they can also significantly over-
lap with each other. Collisional quenching with surrounding gases
serves as additional source of complications for quantitative PAH
LIF analysis [449] .

Nevertheless, there is recent progress towards quantitative mea-
surement of PAH, using LIF. The new technique −called jet-cooled
LIF −is based on the extraction of flame-generated species through
a microprobe and subsequent expansion via a supersonic jet, be-
fore being analyzed using LIF in an analysis chamber [55,450,451] .
The supersonic expansion reduced the temperature and also the
possibility  of  an  otherwise  large  number  of  vibronic  transitions,
making the fluorescence spectra more structured and amenable to
selective detection. Furthermore, the LIF quenching effect can also
be reduced, making quantification easier. Although this method re-
quires probe sampling and thus is not non-intrusive, it provides an
important alternative for quantitative PAH measurement in flames.
Nevertheless, to date, the jet-cooled LIF has been successfully used
only to measure a couple of PAH species and further effort s are
required to extend its range of application and to quantify mea-
surement uncertainties.

LIF  can  also  be  used  to  detect  flame-generated  nanoparticles
which exhibit molecular characteristics [51,290,452,453] . Differen-
tiation between particles and PAH molecules can be obtained by
time-resolved fluorescence polarization anisotropy [454–456] .

More recently, infrared LIF (IR-LIF) has attracted interests since
2 , CO
it can be used to measure important molecules such as CO
and  H
2 O,  which  are  not  accessible  by  conventional  UV–Vis  LIF
techniques  [457,458] .  The  application  of  this  technique  in  harsh
combustion environments is expected to be promising, especially
considering that it can also provide 2-D temperature distribution
using a two-color method [457] (conventional two-color OH PLIF
for temperature measurements is restricted to regions where OH
are  abundant).  We  finally  quote  a  recent  study  using  femtosec-
ond two-photon laser-induced fluorescence (fs-TPLIF) to measure
H atom in sooting premixed flames [459] to demonstrate the ap-
plicability of LIF in sooting flames.

Another  species-selective  technique  frequently  employed  in
combustion  research  is  Raman  scattering,  which  is  based  on  in-
elastic  interactions  (as  opposed  to  the  elastic  Rayleigh  scatter-
ing) between incident photons and target molecules. The scattered
light has a species-dependent fingerprint frequency shift relative
to  the  incident  light  (Raman  shift),  which  can  be  used  to  iden-
tify and quantify species. Spontaneous Raman scattering is suitable
for point measurements of major combustion species such as O
2 ,
CO, CO
2 O. An important advantage of spontaneous Raman
scattering is its ability to measure multiple species simultaneously
[460–462] ; while an important disadvantage is its very weak sig-
nal. In practice, high-energy pulsed laser beam is focused into a
measurement  point  and  the  resulting  Raman  scattering  signal  is
spectrally-resolved with a spectrograph before being recorded with
an  intensified  camera.  One  major  drawback  of  Raman  scattering
is  the  costly  and  bulky  instruments  (high-resolution  spectrome-
ter, high-energy laser and intensified detectors) it requires, which
limit its application largely to laboratory conditions. Note, the Ra-
man scattering signal intensity can be enhanced by tuning the in-
cident photon energy resonant with a specific species of interests
(i.e., resonance Raman scattering) [463] .

Both the LIF and Raman scattering techniques discussed above
are  incoherent  methods  and  the  signals  leave  the  sample  in  all
directions,  covering  the  whole  4 π solid  angle,  while  the  collec-
tion of the scattered signal can only be achieved over a relatively
small solid angle. This reduced signal collection efficiency can be
overcome  by  using  coherent  techniques  in  which  the  signal  be-

176

comes beam-like and can be effectively directed to a detector. A
thorough discussion of four-wave mixing techniques, among which
the widely-used coherent anti-stokes Raman spectroscopy (CARS)
is  a  particular  configuration,  was  provided  by  Kiefer  and  Ewart
[433] . Recent studies using CARS to measure temperature in soot-
ing coflow diffusion flames [464,465] are quoted here to demon-
strate its applicability in sooting environments.

3.2. Soot measurements

Soot loading in a flame is typically represented by soot volume
fraction (SVF, or f v ), so its experimental determination is central to
soot research. Therefore, it is worthwhile to provide a discussion
here on various diagnostic techniques developed for quantitative
SVF measurements.

3.2.1. Light extinction

Soot  particles  are  known  to  absorb  light  in  a  broad  spectral
range from UV to IR, so that the intensity of any light beam (vis-
ible or near IR) passing through a soot-laden flame is expected to
be attenuated. The extent of such intensity reduction can be cor-
related to the volumetric loading of soot particles. In typical light
extinction experiments, the intensity of a probe beam with a fixed
wavelength ( λ) is measured both before ( I λ,0 ) and after ( I λ) passing
the flame, and their ratio is defined as the light transmissivity ( τ λ).
The local extinction coefficient K
ext, λ can then be obtained through
the Beer–Lambert law as:

(cid:6)
τλ = I/ I 0 = exp

(12)

where L is the length of light path. For a homogeneous system in
which K
ext, λ is a constant along the optical path, Eq. (12) can be
reduced to a simpler form:
ext ,λ = − ln ( τλ) /L = − ln ( I/ I 0 ) /L
K

(13)

For axisymmetric cases such as counterflow or coflow diffusion
flames, an inversion algorithm [466,467] can be used to derive lo-
ext, λ from multiple realizations of line-of-sight measurements.
cal K
The inference of SVF from measured local extinction coefficients
requires  fundamental  knowledge  of  soot-light  interactions.  The
complex  soot  morphology  makes  it  computationally  demanding
to use exact  theories to analyze such interactions. Consequently,
researchers frequently use the Rayleigh-Debye-Gans–fractal aggre-
gate (RDG-FA) theory as an approximation of the otherwise inten-
sive analysis. According to the RDG-FA theory, the local extinction
coefficient can be written as:
3
E (  ̃ m λ) /λ
ext ,λ = N pp π 2
D pp
K

(14)

where  N pp  and  D pp  are  the  number  density  and  the  diame-
ter  of  primary  particles,  respectively.   ̃ m λ is  the  wavelength  ( λ)-
dependent soot complex refractive index and E (  ̃ m λ) is the light ab-
sorption function, which is defined as:
(cid:7)
λ − 1
λ + 2

(cid:6)
E (  ̃ m λ) = −Im

 ̃ m 2
 ̃ m 2

(15)

Since in the RDG-FA theory, soot particles are treated as fractal
aggregates of mono-dispersed spherical particles in point contact,
Eq. (14) further shows the total volume of the soot aggregates (i.e.,
soot volume fraction, f v ) to be:

f v  =

λK
ext ,λ
6 π E (  ̃ m λ)

(16)

Note  that  in  writing  Eq.  (14) ,  it  was  assumed  that  light  ex-
tinction is solely due to soot absorption. In reality, however, both
particle scattering and light absorption by gas-phase species (such

as PAHs) may contribute to intensity attenuation of the transmit-
ted  light.  The  ratio  of  scattering  coefficient  to  absorption  coeffi-
cient can be determined, provided the morphology of particles is
known (see, e.g. Ref. [468] ). Nevertheless, when the optical sizes of
soot aggregates are significantly smaller than the laser wavelength
(2 π R g / λ <  0.3,  where R g  is the radius  of gyration  of agglomer-
ate),  light  scattering  becomes  negligible  compared  to  absorption
[469,470] . The absorption by a gas-phase species can be estimated
by running the HITRAN code for typical combustion products. Si-
monsson et al. [471] found that for a rich-premixed flame, molecu-
lar absorption in the near-infrared regime (700 −1064 nm, typically
used for soot measurement) from major combustion products, is
2 O molecules at 978.6 nm. However, the absorption
dominated by H
strength was rather small and its contribution to soot light extinc-
tion was concluded to be marginal [471] . This is especially true in
practical cases where it is rare for the light wavelength used for
soot measurement to be coincident with the narrow spectral line
resonant for molecular absorption.

On the other hand, PAHs, with their complex molecular struc-
tures,  are  known  to  absorb  significantly  in  the  UV–Vis  spectral
range [472] . Since PAHs are precursors to soot, flames with high
soot loadings are also featured with high concentrations of PAHs,
so that  PAH interference is expected to  become worse for more
sooting flames. If the wavelength of the probe light lies in such
a UV–Vis spectrum, the interference of soot extinction from PAH
absorption must be accounted for. The simplest, and perhaps the
most effective remedy, is to perform soot extinction measurements
with light wavelength in the near-infrared regime (i.e., > 700 nm),
for which PAH absorption is minimal [473] . The employment of a
near-infrared beam may have additional benefits as the absorption
ratio for soot aggregates is predicted to decrease with increasing
λ [127] .  However,  it  is  worthwhile  to  point  out  that  previously
many studies in the literature used light in the visible spectrum
for soot extinction measurement. Thus, this fact should be consid-
ered when interpreting data in the literature.

A major source of uncertainty in light extinction measurement
is the quantitative variations of the soot complex refractive index
 ̃ m λ (and thus E (  ̃ m λ)) on wavelength, and on the physical/chemical
properties  of  soot  produced  from  different  sources.  The  spectral
dependence  of  E (  ̃ m λ)  for  mature  soot  from  coflow  ethylene  dif-
fusion flames has been studied using laser-induced incandescence
(LII, discussed later) with both 532 and 1064 nm beams. It was de-
termined that the absorption cross-sections have a λ−0.83  depen-
dence [474] . Cleon et al. [475] determined E (  ̃ m λ) along a rich pre-
mixed burner-stabilized methane flame and found that the ratio of
E (  ̃ m 532 nm )/ E (  ̃ m 1064 nm ) decreased significantly with the height above
the burner (HAB) in the nascent soot region, but it tended to level
off at higher HAB. This indicates that soot at different flame lo-
cations have different optical properties. Nevertheless, the optical
properties of mature soot appear to have a more consistent value
[127] .

In  many  cases,  a  narrow  laser  beam  is  sent  through  a  soot-
laden flame and a single-point photodiode is used to detect the
transmitted beam intensity. For a one-dimensional soot field (in a
burner-stabilized flat premixed flame, or planar counterflow diffu-
sion flames), the spatial resolution of measurement is then deter-
mined primarily by the beam size. The spatial variation of the soot
field is obtained by passing the beam through different locations of
the flame, realized by either moving the flame relative to a fixed
beam [140,476] , or moving the complete optical setup relative to a
fixed flame burner [69] . A major disadvantage of such line-by-line
measurements is that it may take a longer time to scan the entire
flame, thus it is not practical to measure soot fields that are time
dependent. Alternatively, a 2D collimated beam that covers the en-
tire flame area (projection along the direction of the beam) can be
employed, with a camera serving as the device for light intensity

the  Planck’s  law  (rather  accurate  in  the  visible  to  near  infrared
spectrum) is invoked in writing in the latter half of Eq. (18) . In
Eq. (17) , the term of ηλB λ (i.e., K

era records the intensity of a light ray transmitted through a differ-
ent location of the flame. Hence, a complete map can be obtained
at once, allowing for instant measurements of time-varying soot
fields, for example, in flickering coflow diffusion flame [479] . Note
that beam steering, which is caused by the lensing effect of flame
gases, must be minimal or its influence should be accounted for
in extinction measurements, especially in cases where a large tem-
perature gradient (therefore a large density gradient) exists. Exam-
ples of such cases include counterflow diffusion flames and high-
pressure coflow flames [477] .

3.2.2. Spectral soot emission

The  spectral  emissions  of  flame-heated  soot  particles  provide
information on both soot temperature and volume fractions. In ax-
isymmetric flames, soot radiation transmitted along a line-of-sight
can  be  detected  and  spectrally  resolved  using  a  spectrometer.  A
typical optical setup for such spectral soot emission (SSE) measure-
ment is schematically shown in Fig. 8 . The detected light intensity
can be described as [4 80,4 81] :

where y
0 denotes the distance between the line-of-sight chord and
the  symmetry  plane  of  a  flame/burner;  x  is  the  distance  along
the  chord  under  consideration,  with  0  defined  at  the  symmetry
point; ηλ is the local soot absorption coefficient, and is equal to
the soot extinction coefficient K
ext , λ under the assumption of neg-
ligible scattering [482] , so that it is related to SVF through Eq. (16) .
B λ is the Planck function of wavelength λ and temperature T and

As seen, the left side of Eq. (19) has a linear relationship with
1/ λ and the slope, hc / kT , is solely determined by temperature. In
practical applications, hc / kT can be obtained by a curve fitting us-
ing  the  method  of  least  mean  squares.  Once  the  temperature  is
known, Eq. (19) can be used again to provide f v .

One practical challenge in this spectral soot emission technique
is the accurate determination of the local values of ηλ, or equiv-
alently  K
ext , λ,  with  the  assumption  of  zero  scattering.  First,  the
detection  system  must  have  a  large  depth  of  field  to  allow  ev-
ery emitter along the line-of-sight to be properly focused into the
spectrometer. This was shown to be achievable using an imaging
lens  with  a  sufficiently  large  f-number  [480]  (for  example,  f/48
was used in recent studies [4 85,4 86] ). Second, the self-absorption
of soot emission must be accounted for [480] because: (1) Emis-
sions from different emitters along the line-of-sight will be atten-
uated unequally due to the different path lengths toward the de-
tector, causing the axisymmetric assumption needed for Abel-like
tomographic  inversion  to  break  down  and  (2)  Self-absorption  is
also dependent on λ and as such it complicates the soot tempera-
ture measurement by shifting the slope, as discussed in Eq. (19) .
In  view  of  these  issues,  Snelling  et  al.  [480]  proposed  an  itera-
tive method to correct for self-absorption, and Liu et al. [484] con-
cluded that when the maximum flame optical thickness exceeds
0.3 such correction becomes particularly important.

Also suggested by Eq. (19) , the emissions theoretically need to
be detected at only two wavelengths to find the flame temperature
and f v , considering two points in the (

ext,λ(r) B λ(r) λ6 , 1/ λ) plane can

already determine the line whose slope is hc / kT . The experimental
technique based on this fact is known as two-color pyrometry and
it was also used extensively in soot measurements. Although the
measurement uncertainty can be larger than its multi-wavelength
counterpart, a spectrometer is no longer needed and 2D measure-
ments are possible with a color filtered CCD camera as a detector
[4 87,4 88] .

This  spectral  soot  emission  (SSE)  technique  has  been  applied
successfully in many soot studies, especially for coflow diffusion
flames at high pressures (see Karatas and Gülder [107] and refer-
ences therein). A notable advantage of SSE is that no additional il-
luminating source is required, and for high-pressure applications,
optical  access  is  needed  only  from  one  side  of  a  high-pressure
chamber,  simplifying  the  design  of  the  pressure  chamber  [107] .
It  is  noted,  however,  that  SSE  was  employed  for  soot  studies  in
counterflow diffusion flames only very recently by Gleason et al.

[4 89,4 90] . By contrasting the soot temperature as determined by
SSE against the well-established temperature from the literature,
the authors were also able to obtain information on the dispersion
exponent, a soot optical property related to its hydrogen content.

3.2.3. Laser-induced incandescence

Laser-induced incandescence (LII) refers to the quasi-blackbody
radiation of soot particles after being heated up to about 40 0 0 K by
high-energy laser beams. Through analysis of such radiation, many
properties of soot ensemble can be derived, such as SVF and soot
primary particle size. Dedicated reviews on the LII technique for
soot  diagnostic  exist  in  the  literature  [126–128,491] ,  and  a  brief
overview of the basics of this promising method is given here.

The usefulness of LII stems from the fact that SVF is reasonably
proportional to LII signal intensity ( I
LII ) [4 92,4 93] . Melton [4 92] has
shown that, for soot ensembles with primary particle sizes smaller
than the incident laser wavelength, the LII signal intensity can be
written approximately as:

NP ( D ) D n

dD,  with n = 3 + 154 / λ

det

(20)

(cid:10) ∞

I LII = C 1

0

where N is the total particle number density, P ( D ) is the normal-
ized probability density for particle with diameter D , and λ
det  is
the detection wavelength in nm unit. As can be seen, for larger
detection  wavelengths,  the  exponent  n  approaches  three  and  I
becomes linearly proportional to SVF.

LII

It is noteworthy that Eq. (20) was obtained in the limit of high
laser  power.  Whether  this  limit  is  achieved  in  practice  can  be
tested by plotting I
LII as a function of laser pulse energy. Typically,
I
LII initially increases, reaching a plateau regime (saturation), then
begins to decrease again (due to soot evaporation) with progres-
sive increases in laser energy [494] . Experiments are typically con-
ducted in the plateau regime so that the signals are not affected
by the pulse-to-pulse energy variations of the laser beam. Due to
potential interference from PAH fluorescence, it is generally recom-
mended that infrared light be used as the excitation source [472] ,
although a recent work [459] showed that by delayed detection,
the SVF measured using UV (266 nm) excited LII is similar to that
excited by a near-infrared beam (1064 nm).

LII  measurement  alone  cannot  provide  the  absolute  value  of
1  in  Eq.  (20) )  depends
SVF,  since  the  proportionality  constant  ( C
on many parameters requiring experimental calibration. Additional
light extinction/spectral emission measurements [472] , or absolute
irradiance calibration [4 95,4 96] , are possible approaches that pro-
vide quantitative relations between LII intensity and absolute SVF.
When the LII signal is analyzed in a time-resolved manner, in-
formation about particle size can be obtained in addition to SVF.
This  is  based  on  the  fact  that  particles  with  different  diameters
are cooled down (after laser heating) at different rates [497] . Large
particles have low surface area to volume ratio and thus are cooled
relatively slowly compared to small particles. To obtain the quan-
titative relationship between LII signal decay rate and soot parti-
cle size, a model that describes the heat/mass exchange processes
between the particle and the surrounding gases [498] is required.
There are three major paths for energy loss: sublimation of soot
particles, heat conduction to the surrounding gas and radiation of
soot particles. Such energy losses can be corrected with the inter-
nal energy of soot particles through the following energy conser-
vation equation [126] :

ergy loss due to heat conduction to surrounding gas, sublimation
and heat radiation, respectively. The rate of change of soot internal

can be found in the review by Michelson [126] , and they are gen-
erally dependent on primary particle sizes.

An important parameter in determining heat loss rates is soot
temperature, which can be obtained by taking the ratio of soot ra-
diation intensity at two different wavelengths (i.e., two-color py-
rometry) [499] . With all the above information, a theoretical decay
rate of soot radiation intensity can be computed, and comparison
with an experimentally obtained rate would provide information
on the primary particle size ( D pp ) of soot under investigation.

In practice, time-resolved LII signals can be recorded by a pho-
tomultiplier tube (PMT) with low rise-time to provide high spatial
resolution. Multiple PMTs can be used with different spectral fil-
ters installed to detect LII signals at different wavelengths, provid-
ing spectral information necessary for the retrieval of soot temper-
ature [500] . Alternatively, planar LII can be performed using a high
energy laser sheet as the excitation source and an ICCD camera as
a signal detector. In this case, temporal resolution can be achieved
by making measurements with consecutive gate delays in steady
flames  [501]  and  a  single-shot  measurement  is  also  possible  by
using multiple ICCDs preset with different delay time [502] . The
latter  technique  is  essential  for  measurement  in  highly-transient
turbulent flames [503] .

3.2.4. Thermophoretic sampling

In  addition  to  the  optical  techniques  discussed  above,  ther-
mophoretic  sampling  is  another  important  method  for  obtaining
information regarding size distributions, nanostructures, chemical
compositions and various other important properties of collected
soot particles. The thermophoretic effect refers to the drift of par-
ticles in a direction from high- to low- temperature regions. Ther-
mophoretic sampling makes use of this particle drift to collect hot
soot particles on cool probes. The collected particles can then be
analyzed by various methods, including TEM and AFM. The rate of
deposition can also be linked to local SVF so that accurate determi-
nation of the total mass of the sample can be an effective method
for SVF measurement, as demonstrated by Köylü et al. [504] . This
method is particularly attractive as it can determine SVF without
prior knowledge of soot optical properties such as a refractive in-
dex.

One important consideration when performing thermophoretic
sampling is the dwelling time of the probe inside a flame. If the
dwelling time is too short, not enough particles can be collected
for analysis. If the probe spends too much time in the flame, pro-
cesses  like  thermal  annealing  may  change  the  properties  of  the
collected  particles  and  the  high  temperature  of  flame  may  also
break some more fragile probes, such as a TEM grid. In practice,
rapid  insertion  of  a  probe  through  double-acting  pneumatic,  or
electric-driven  piston,  is  frequently  used  and  the  dwelling  time
can be accurately controlled to the range of tens of milliseconds
[485,505] . In weakly sooting conditions, multiple insertions can be
performed to collect enough soot samples [505] .

It is noted that thermophoretic sampling is seldom performed
in CDFs [506] compared to its wider application in coflow or pre-
mixed flames. This could be explained by the fact the very nar-
row sooting region ( ∼ 1 mm) in CDF makes spatially-resolved ther-
mophoretic  sampling  using  conventional  TEM  grid  very  difficult,
especially considering the large vibration of a probe (to which the
TEM grid is attached) after its rapid insertion (confirmed by high-
speed images [507] ). An innovative solution could be to insert a

fine SiC wire into a flame, with a small angle between the flame
axis and the wire (tilted wire), as pioneered by Figura and Gomez
[508] in the PhD thesis of Figura. In this way, the wire could cover
the entire axial extent of the flame, and particles in different axial
positions of the flame will deposit on different parts of the wire.
The disadvantage with this approach is that, due to the presence of
the SiC wire (which blocks the electron beam in the TEM analysis),
the sampled particles can only be viewed from the side. Recently,
Carbone et al. [54] improved this SiC wire sampling technique and
successfully applied it in a premixed flame, producing quantitative
results (size distribution and volume fraction) via scanning elec-
tron microscopy (SEM) and helium ion microscopy (HIM) analysis
of the soot samples.

Particle sampling is inherently more difficult for high-pressure
flames  due  to  the  presence  of  a  pressure  chamber  and  associ-
ated  limited  physical  access.  The  samples  need  also  be  trans-
ferred out of the chamber for further analysis after each collec-
tion, which may involve time-consuming depressurization and re-
pressurization procedures. To address this issue, Vargas and Gülder
[509]  developed  a  multi-probe  sampling  system  housed  inside
the pressure chamber including a circular sampling disk with ten
extent-adjustable probe arms. A motor drive with programmable
control unit determines which probe is used and the circular ve-
locity of the sampling arm—and thus the sampling time. After each
sampling process, the relevant probe can be retracted and the sam-
ples stored. When all the probes are loaded by samples, the ex-
periment can be stopped, and the chamber is de-pressurized for
sample retrieval.

A  TEM  analysis  of  sampled  particles  can  provide  information
on  the  morphology  of  the  soot  aggregate  and  sizes  along  with
the  internal  structures  of  primary  particles  [510] .  In  addition,  if
enough aggregates are sampled, statistical information on the par-
ticle  size  distributions  can  also  be  obtained.  These  are  impor-
tant  information  complementary  to  what  can  be  obtained  from
optical  techniques.  Nevertheless,  it  is  worth  pointing  out  that
through  a  combination  of  multiple  diagnostic  methods,  Zhao  et
al. [505] demonstrated that nascent soot particles are liquid-like
and  are  largely  transparent  to  the  electron  beam  of  TEM.  As
a  result,  the  TEM  image  contrast  of  these  nascent  particles  is
rather  small.  In  addition,  the  evaporation  of  soot  materials,  as
well as carbon crystallization and annealing, was also observed to
be  caused  by  the  interaction  of  the  soot  sample  and  the  high-
energy  electron  beam  of  TEM  [511,512] .  These  side  effects  make
it  a  challenge  to  measure  nascent  soot  particles  with  diameters
below  10 nm  with  TEM  [511] .  Furthermore,  as  the  nanostructure
of nascent particles may be altered under the irradiation of high-
energy  electrons,  results  from  HRTEM  should  be  analyzed  with
caution.

HIM  is  a  promising  alternative  to  TEM  in  measuring  nascent
soot particles. With much less damage or alteration made to the
sample,  HIM  can  detect  nascent  soot  particles  with  higher  con-
trast [54,511] . Furthermore, HIM was reported to identify particles
as small as 2 nm [511] , notably extending the lower size limit de-
tectable by TEM (typically 10 nm). Nevertheless, it should be noted
that  HIM  cannot  provide  information  of  the  inner  structures  of
samples.

If larger amounts of soot particles are required, a water-cooled
suction tube can be used, and the particles deposited on the cool
tube walls, or filters placed inside the tube can then be extracted
by  solvents  [125] .  The  soluble  material  can  be  studied  by  liq-
uid chromatography, UV absorption and fluorescence [125] while
the  particles  can  be  further  analyzed  by—for  example—a  ther-
mogravimetric analyzer (TGA) for the oxidation characteristics, X-
ray  diffraction  (XRD)  for  crystalline  structures,  and  Raman  spec-
troscopy  and  Fourier  transform  infrared  spectroscopy  (FTIR)  for
chemical properties.

3.2.5. Differential mobility analysis

Differential  mobility  analyzer  (DMA)  is  becoming  an  increas-
ingly  popular  tool  for  the  determination  of  size  distributions  of
flame-generated soot particles [18,49,52,54,125,355,513–515] . DMA,
as a size-selecting device, is usually adopted in combination with
a  particle  counter,  constituting  a  scanning  mobility  particle  sizer
(SMPS)  system.  In  application,  soot-laden  flame  gases  were  first
sampled and diluted within a probe and then charged by a neu-
tralizer  with  known  charge  distributions.  In  an  external  electric
field, the charged particles would move to an electrode of oppo-
site charge at different speeds that are dependent on their electric
mobility and the electric field strength. By scanning the strength
of the external electric field, particles with different mobility sizes
can be separated in a similar manner as in a mass spectrometer,
and subsequent measurement in a particle counter provides num-
ber concentrations of the size-selected particles. After correcting
the mobility size for true particle size [516–518] , a size distribu-
tion can be obtained.

Either an electrometer [54] or a laser optical counter (based on
light scattering by particles) can be used to determine the num-
ber density of the classified particles. In the latter case, condensa-
tion growths of these tiny particles are required before they can
be  counted  optically,  due  to  the  insensitivity  of  the  laser-based
method  to  nano-sized  particles.  Condensation  particle  counter
(CPC) [519] is widely used for effectively counting nano-sized par-
ticles  and  a  detailed  description  of  its  working  principle  can  be
found in Ref. [520] . A brief description is as follows. A particle-
laden flow is brought into contact with a supersaturated vapor of
a working fluid, which condenses on the particles so as to increase
their sizes to an extent enough for optical detection. The level of
supersaturation of the condensing vapor is of critical importance
to the lower detection limit of particle sizes. With the increase in
the supersaturation level, progressively smaller particles can be ac-
tivated. On the other hand, however, if the supersaturation level
is too high, homogeneous nucleation of the vapor itself will take
place, interfering with the target particles and thus leading to false
counts. Iida et al. [521] pointed out that the use of working flu-
ids with high surface tension and low saturation vapor pressure is
helpful to extend the lower limit of detectable particle size. Com-
mercial instrument typically uses water, iso-propanol or n-butanol
as the working fluid with detection limit down to 2.5 nm (e.g., TSI
3776 Ultrafine CPC with n-butanol). More recently, a diethyl glycol
(DEG)-based condensation nano-enhancer, when used in combina-
tion with a second-stage growth booster, has been demonstrated
to be capable of detecting particles with sizes down to 1 nm [522] .
Through a theoretical investigation, de la Mora [523] anticipated
that water at low temperature could even activate particles with
diameter as small as 0.6 nm.

An  important  consideration  when  using  an  SMPS  to  mea-
sure probe-sampled soot particles is to avoid particle losses (e.g.,
through particle coagulation or diffusion to the wall) in the sam-
pling probe and transfer tubes. For example, it was shown that a
loss of 10% of particles can occur in 20 ms for a typical flame gas
that contains 10 10 particles per cm 3 [318] . As such, immediate di-
lution of the sampled gas is of paramount importance [49] . This
means  that  a  large  amount  of  diluent  must  be  mixed  with  the
sampled flame gas immediately, posing significant challenges for
the design of a sample system. A proven methodology was demon-
strated by Wang and coworkers [48,97,230] , who utilized a tubu-
lar probe, crossing a flame with a small pin hole drilled to sample
the flame gas, while a carrier gas of fixed flow rate served as the
diluent. Since a large flow rate of the diluent is required, the tubu-
lar probe must be relatively large (typically a tube with 1/4-inch
OD is used) so that it may significantly affect the flow field and
the flame. To address this issue Abid et al. [48] proposed, for ap-
plications in burner-stabilized flat premixed flames, to conceal the

180

probe in a stagnation plate, which also serves as a stabilizing plate
and a downstream boundary. As long as this downstream bound-
ary can be accounted for in accompanying numerical simulations,
the presence of the probe posed no problems. Nevertheless, this
proposed method is only applicable to premixed burned-stabilized
flames. For other types of flames, significant challenges still exist
in the design of suitable sampling systems with minimal influence
on the flame itself. This challenge may explain why the majority of
SMPS flame measurements were performed for premixed flames,
while limited studies for coflow diffusion were mainly performed
at the flame tip [515] .

Particle size distribution, measured using SMPS, can be a rich
source of information on various soot formation processes, as de-
tailed in a previous section. Singh et al. [322] (also summarized in
Ref. [18] ) showed that various features of a size distribution func-
tion are directly related to −for example −nucleus size, nucleation,
surface growth, and coagulation rates. In this regard, and also as
pointed  out  by  Wang  [18] ,  many  soot  model  parameters  can  be
fine-tuned and made more practical by validation against the ex-
perimentally measured size distributions.

There are additional techniques for soot characterization, such
as  dynamic  light  scattering,  X-ray  scattering,  neutron  scattering,
aerosol mass spectrometry, etc. The scope of this review does not
allow for further discussion of these techniques. More details can
be  found  in  excellent  summaries  by  Kohse-Höinghaus  and  Jef-
fries  [524] ,  D’Anna  [125] ,  Wang  [18] ,  Desgroux  et  al.  [127] ,  and
Michelsen [128] .

4. Sooting structures and soot evolution in counterflow flames

Knowledge about sooting structures is necessary for a funda-
mental understanding of soot evolution in flames. As such, we dis-
cuss  in  this  section  the  general  flame  and  sooting  structures  in
CDFs, along with their differences/similarities to those in coflow
diffusion flames. We then highlight the response of soot evolution
to flame structure variations, which is followed by a discussion on
the effects of strain rate on sooting processes in CDFs. This sec-
tion concludes with a description of soot formation in partially-
premixed counterflow flames.

4.1. Sooting structures of CDFs and comparison with coflow diffusion
flames

In a counterflow flame, the nozzle exit velocities for the fuel
and  oxidizer  streams  are  with  opposite  signs.  Therefore,  some-
where  between  the  nozzles  there  always  exists  a  location  with
zero axial velocity, that is the stagnation plane . The relative posi-
tions between the high-temperature reaction sheet and the stag-
nation  plane  have  a  strong  influence  on  soot  evolution  in  CDFs.
Specifically, sooting CDFs can be differentiated into two distinctive
types based on this relative position [73] : soot formation flames
and soot formation/oxidation (SFO) flames. The schematics shown
in Fig. 9 help to clarify this point.

Fig.  9 a  depicts  a  situation  when  the  flame  is  located  on  the
oxidizer side of the stagnation plane. In such a case, soot parti-
cles, which are incepted on the fuel side from the flame sheet, will
be convected away from the flame towards the stagnation plane,
without passing through the oxidative high temperature flame re-
gion. While being transported, these soot particles will continue to
grow through surface reactions and particle-particle coagulations.
They will eventually leak out radially to the environment, because
it is unlikely for these large particles to diffuse across the stagna-
tion plane. Soot oxidation is not present during this process, since
oxidizing species such as OH and O
2 only exist with considerable
concentrations on the oxidizer side of, or near, the flame sheet. As
a result, such flames are termed soot formation flames. In contrast,

when the flame sheet is located on the fuel side of the stagna-
tion plane ( Fig. 9 b), soot particles are convected towards the flame,
2  and  OH  radicals  occur.  In
where  intensive  soot  oxidation  by  O
many cases, the initially formed soot particles can be completely
oxidized, so no soot emission can be observed out of the flame.
This type of CDF is termed the soot formation/oxidation flame .

More detailed flame and sooting structures for SF/SFO flames
were investigated by Kang et al. [73] . The axial profiles of tempera-
ture, fuel, oxygen, and important soot precursor concentrations, as
well as those of SVF, average soot particle size and number den-
sity, are shown in Fig. 10 for typical SF and SFO flames fueled by
propane.

2 H

For  the  SFO  flame  ( X

O,0 = 0.7,  where  X  is  the
F,0 = 0.25  and  X
mole  fraction,  the  subscripts  F  and  O  indicate  fuel  and  oxygen
in the fuel and oxidizer streams, respectively; the subscript 0 is
the freestream, and z is the distance from fuel nozzle) shown in
Fig. 10 (a-d), the location of the flame sheet (represented by the
T,max ) stays close to the stagna-
maximum temperature location z
tion  plane  ( z stg,p ).  Here,  the  difference  between  the  particle  and
gas-phase  ( z stg )  stagnation  planes  can  be  attributed  to  the  ther-
mophoretic effect. Fuel pyrolysis and PAH growth occur on the fuel
side of the particle stagnation plane (also of the flame sheet), con-
firmed by the profiles of C
2 mole fraction (a) and the PAH flu-
f  (b). The sooting zone, indicated by the light
orescence signal Q
scattering signal Q
VV , is also located in this region (b). It is noted
VV begins to rise near z = 5 mm ( ∼1700 K), indicating the ini-
that Q
tiation of soot inception at this position. The coincidence of the
location of peak PAH fluorescence (represented by Q
f ) with the lo-
cation at which soot inception begins may indicate the critical role
of PAHs for soot inception. As the formed particles are convected
(to the right) towards the particle stagnation plane, their number
density continues to decrease (c), due primarily to particle-particle
coagulation. Meanwhile, the average particle size D
63 (c) and soot
volume fractions increase through surface growth and coagulation
(d), reaching their peaks near z = 6 mm, and then decreasing due to
oxidation. Note an appreciable amount of OH radicals exists on the
fuel side of the flame sheet (a), where the soot zone is situated.

2 H

F,0 = 1.0, X

In the SF flame ( X

O,0 = 0.25) shown in Fig. 10 (e-h), the
flame front is spatially separated from, and on the oxidizer side of,
the stagnation plane. C
2  and PAH fluorescence are distributed
between the stagnation plane and the flame sheet (e,f). The peak
of the number density profile and the onset of Q
VV are located near
z = 7 mm, where soot inception occurs. These newly-incepted soot
particles are then convected towards the stagnation plane ( away
from the flame sheet). Following the direction of this convection
transport (to the left), soot number density (g) decreases, but aver-
age particle size (g) and soot volume fraction (h) increase, through
both coagulation and surface growth, reaching their peaks at the
stagnation plane. In this process, soot oxidation hardly occurs be-
cause few OH radicals exist in the sooting zone of z = 5 −7 mm (e).
Note, it was observed [242,281,407,525,526] that a SF flame visu-
ally exhibited three distinct zones from the fuel side to the oxi-
dizer: an orange zone, a luminous yellow zone on the fuel side of
the flame, and a blue flame reaction zone. This is consistent with
the flame and soot zone structures shown in Fig. 10 (e-f).

The  above  work  of  Kang  et  al.  [73]  offers  general  knowledge
on sooting characteristics of SF and SFO flames, which were fur-
ther investigated through measurements of soot precursor (PAH)
concentration,  soot  volume  fractions  [281,372,447,527,528] ,  and
through numerical simulations using detailed kinetic mechanisms
[87,380] . From these investigations, major differences in the soot-
ing structures between SF and SFO flames can be identified, which
are summarized as follows.

In a SFO flame, considerable amounts of OH radicals exist on
the fuel side of the flame sheet, overlapping with the sooting zone.
The spatial proximity of soot and OH species means that significant

side of the stagnation plane (b). Mie scattering images are also included to show soot leakage (thus emission) through the particle stagnation plane in SF flame. In SFO
flame, initially formed soot can be oxidized completely, so no soot emission can be observed [73] . .

soot oxidation can take place as soot particles (formed on the fuel
side of flame) are transported by the convective flow towards the
high temperature flame sheet. In a SF flame, on the other hand,
there is a large spatial separation between the flame sheet and the
stagnation plane, and the convection is in a direction away from
the  flame.  Consequently,  unlike  in  SFO  flames,  oxidizing  species
2  do not coincide with the soot zone, so soot oxi-
like OH and O
dation is absent [73] . These differences in soot evolution result in
the distinct shape of SVF profiles between SFO and SF flames, as
can be more clearly seen in Fig. 11 [378] . In SFO flames, the profile
of SVF is somewhat symmetric, indicating that the soot particles
continuously experience inception, growth, and finally, destructive
oxidation. The SVF drops to a negligible level before reaching the
stagnation  plane,  consistent  with  the  fact  that  SFO  flames  typi-
cally do not emit soot. In contrast, the SVF profile in SF flame is
highly skewed toward the fuel side, characterized by a sharp de-
crease across the stagnation plane, a phenomenon observed also in
several other studies [78,281,529,530] . This is because the particles
have very low diffusivity and cannot effectively penetrate through
the stagnation plane, so they eventually leak out of the flame in
the radial direction.

Of  special  note  is  the  observation  by  D’Anna  and  coworkers
O,0  =  0.22  di-
[372,531]  that  in  a  C
4  SF  flame  ( X
luted by Ar), abundant small particles also exist on the fuel side
of the stagnation plane. The presence of soot in this pyrolytic re-
gion  can  be  explained,  according  to  the  authors,  by  the  forma-
tion  of  soot  nuclei  through  physical  coagulation  of  PAHs  under
low temperature conditions. At first glance, this observation seems
to be incompatible from the measurements of Xu et al. [378] , in
which  negligible  amount  of  soot  exists  on  the  fuel  side  of  par-
ticle  stagnation  plane  ( Fig.  11 ).  However,  it  is  important  to  re-

alize  that  D’Anna’s  observation  is  consistent  with  the  high  soot
number density on the fuel side of SF flames, as predicted by Xu
et al. [378] through a detailed PAH-based soot model. The parti-
cles formed on the fuel side are not likely to experience signifi-
cant mass-adding surface reactions due to the relatively low tem-
perature in the region. Therefore, these particles are nascent and
may have notably different optical properties compared to mature
graphitic soot. They can even be liquid-like [18,485] and transpar-
ent to visible/near infrared lights and so cannot be effectively de-
tected by the visible or infrared light extinction method, as em-
ployed  in  the  work  of  Xu  et  al.  [378]  and  many  others.  On  the
other  hand,  these  nanoparticles  may  well  respond  to  the  laser-
induced  emission  spectrum  method  with  the  use  of  a  UV  laser
(266 nm) as the excitation source, a technique frequently used by
D’Anna and coworkers [372,531] .

Another interesting difference between SF and SFO flames re-
gards  the  profiles  of  PAH  LIF  signals,  which  were  observed  to
have double peaks in SFO flames, but only one peak in SF flames
[281,447,528] .  Fig.  12  shows  a  comparison  of  the  measured  SVF
and PAH fluorescence profiles between typical C
4 SFO (a) and SF
(b) counterflow flames. In the SFO flames (a), a second increase of
PAH fluorescence, starting at around z = 5 mm, can be clearly seen.
Considering that it occurs in the high- temperature soot oxidation
zone, where soot oxidation by OH radicals leads to a decrease in
SVF, Hwang et al. [281] tentatively attributed this second peak of
LIF signal to PAHs generated by soot oxidative fragmentation.

direct photos and sooting structures of these flames are presented.
For the normal coflow flame ( Fig. 13 a, central fuel jet surrounded
by coflowing oxidizer), PAHs are formed in the fuel-rich pyrolysis
zone  near  the  fuel  nozzle,  and  are  then  incepted  to  form  soot
particles, which are spatially distributed downstream of the PAH
region. Soot particles are then transported further downstream to-
wards the high temperature reaction zone, where highly oxidative
OH  radicals  are  abundant.  Consequently,  the  axial  profile  of  SVF
and particle size both exhibited a rise-then-fall behavior with the
increase  in  axial  distance  above  the  nozzle  [62,72,323,403,532–
534] , similar to the case for a CDF of the SFO type.

For an inverse coflow flame ( Fig. 13 b, central jet of oxidizer sur-
rounded  by  coflowing  fuel),  the  LIF  and  LII  images  obtained  by
Mikofski et al. [535] showed that the formation of PAHs and the
soot zone occurred close to the flame wing, and the sooting zone
almost completely enclosed the central reaction sheet −a fact that
can also be visually confirmed by the relative position of the yel-
low luminous region and the blue flame zone in Fig. 13 d. As a re-
sult, after formation, soot particles are convected away from the
high temperature flame sheet and are eventually emitted out from
the flame. This evolution process is similar to that in SF CDFs; it
also explains the experimental fact that the radially integrated SVF
of inverse coflow increases and approaches a constant value down-
stream  of  the  flame  (i.e.,  no  oxidation)  [535,536] .  These  studies
demonstrated  the  important  role  of  flow  convection  in  the  evo-
lution  of  soot  particles  and  thus  in  affecting  the  overall  sooting
structures of diffusion flames.

4.2. Influences of stoichiometric mixture fraction on sooting
structures in CDFs

The above discussions on the differences in soot evolution be-
tween  SF  and  SFO  flames  highlight  the  important  role  of  flame
location  in  determining  the  sooting  behavior  in  CDFs.  The  vari-
ation  of  flame  location  can  be  achieved  by  adjusting  the  dilu-
tion level in the fuel and/or oxidizer streams. The extent can be
quantified  by  the  stoichiometric  mixture  fraction,  Z st ,  defined  as
F ) −1 . Here, Y represents the mass frac-

stoichiometric coefficients, respectively. Therefore, the value of Z st
will  change  when  fuel  or  oxidizer  compositions  vary,  indicating
the change of flame structure. A typical SF flame with undiluted
fuel/air combustion (SFO flame with diluted fuel burning in pure
oxygen) corresponds to a low (high) Z st value.

Atreya et al. [539] investigated the effect of Z st on soot forma-
tion in a series of low strain rate methane CDFs (effects of strain
rate to be discussed in Section 4.3 ). The sooting structures of four
flames, with Z st  increasing from 0.129 to 0.584, are compared in
Fig.  14 .  The  data  showed  that  as  Z st  increased,  the  flame  front
T, max ) moved progressively towards the fuel side, along with the
( z
shift of the stagnation plane ( z stg,p ) from the oxidizer to the fuel
side. Such change of flame location notably affected the structures
of the soot zone in many aspects. First, the flame with Z st = 0.129
(a) had the largest soot zone thickness but the smallest average
temperature  in  the  soot  zone;  Second,  SVF  increased  monotoni-

cally towards the stagnation plane (following the direction of par-
ticle convection) in flames with Z st = 0.129 and 0.297 (a, b) −cases
in which the reaction sheets were located on the oxidizer side of
z stg,p . However, the SVF profiles exhibited a rise-then-fall behav-
ior for flames with Z st = 0.48 (c) and 0.584 (d), where the reaction
front was either close to, or on the fuel side of, z stg,p . These re-
sults were consistent with the aforementioned sooting character-
istics  of  typical  SF  and  SFO  flames;  Third,  particle  number  den-
sity  ( N )  decreased  continuously  toward  the  stagnation  plane  for
Z st = 0.129, although it varied non-monotonically with z for the re-
maining three flames with larger Z st . This result suggests that the
soot inception process can be strongly affected by the spatial shift
of  OH  radicals  towards  the  sooting  zone  with  increasing  Z st .  As
Atreya  et  al.  [539]  explained,  this  behavior  was  also  compatible
with the fact that the calculated OH mole fraction (without soot
model) agreed well with the measured one for Z st = 0.129, but ob-
viously  higher than the  measured for  cases with Z st = 0.297 and
0.48 −suggesting  a  fraction  of  OH  radicals  may  be  consumed  for
the oxidation of soot particles in the latter cases.

Also note in Fig. 14 , peak SVFs showed a non-monotonic varia-
tion with Z st , with the flame of Z st = 0.48 having the highest peak
SVF. This phenomenon is different from the observations in Refs.
[377,540–545] , where peak SVF decreased monotonically with the
increase in Z st . Such differences may derive from the fact that the
adiabatic flame temperatures remained unchanged as Z st varied in
Refs. [377,540–545] , but they were not controlled by Atreya et al.
[539] . With fixed peak temperature, results from Refs. [377,540–
545] generally showed that the inhibition of soot and their pre-
cursors with increasing Z st can be attributed to both the hydrody-
namic effects and the alteration of flame structure.

The hydrodynamic effects refer to the directional change of soot
convection when Z st changes [542] . The change in flame structure

with Z st (i.e., the relationship between the temperature and local
species concentration) may also affect soot formation significantly,
as demonstrated by Du and Axelbaum [540] through detailed ex-
perimental and numerical studies of ethylene CDFs. In their study,
the sooting tendency of the CDFs decreased monotonically as Z st
increased, attributed by the authors to the result of flame structure
variation.  Note,  since  only  critical  sooting  condition  was  consid-
ered, the flames studied were only relevant to soot inception (i.e.,
without particle growth/transport processes), and therefore were
expected not to be sensitive to the hydrodynamic effects. The gen-
eral flame structures for flames with Z st of 0.064 and 0.78 are com-
pared in Fig. 15 . As seen, the flame with higher Z st had lower fuel
O2 ) near the
C2H4 ) but higher oxygen concentrations ( Y
(marked as Y
reaction zone. Du and Axelbaum argued that in flames with high
Z st , the low fuel concentration tended to slow down fuel pyroly-
sis and soot precursor formation. In addition, the shift of oxygen
concentration towards the fuel side enhanced the oxidation of soot
precursors, also contributing to a reduction of soot formation. Sim-
ilar arguments have been made by other researchers [377,546,547] .
Furthermore,  the  sooting  zone  was  known  to  be  constrained  in
a region bounded by the oxidizing flame sheet and the fuel-rich
zone, with temperatures high enough for soot inception [539,540] .
As Z st increased, the spatial shift of the oxidizing species towards
the fuel nozzle reduced the thickness of the sooting zone until it
reached a soot-free (permanently blue) condition [540] .

Through  numerical  simulations  with  detailed  chemistry  ac-
counting  for  aromatic  species  formation,  Skeen  et  al.  [543]  at-
tributed the soot-free phenomena in high Z st flame to the inhibited
formation of soot precursors (i.e., benzene and phenyl). In their se-
ries of ethylene CDFs investigated, an increase in Z st was seen to
decrease the temperature in the fuel pyrolysis zone where abun-
dant H radical existed, although the peak temperature remained
constant.  This,  in  turn,  drove  the  dominant  propargyl  formation

The  change  of  Z st  can  result  in  flame  structure  variations  in
both physical distance and mixture fraction ( Z ) space, which may
make it somewhat difficult to interpret the effects of Z st on sooting
behavior. In such a context, Axelbaum and coworkers [77,548] pro-
posed to understand the flame structure effect in C/O ratio space.
The parameter of C/O ratio can also indicate the local mixing pro-
cess, and unlike the mixture fraction Z , it is insensitive to variation
in fuel/oxidizer boundary composition. As shown in Fig. 16 a, when
plotting the flame structure in terms of C/O ratio, the flame sheet
is always located at (C/O) st , which has a numerical value of 1/3
for ethylene fuel, regardless of Z st . In contrast, the flame location
changed notably with Z st when expressed in Z space (see Fig. 15 ).
As an example of application, Xia et al. [77] analyzed the soot-free
phenomena in high Z st flame reported by Skeen et al. [543] . Unlike
the case where a considerable shift of H radical and temperature
profiles occurred in the physical distance space [543] , the edge of
the H profile (fall-off) remained at nearly the same C/O ratio of 0.5
( Fig. 16 b). Therefore, it was straightforward to observe the reduc-
tion of flame temperature at C/O = 0.5 when Z st increased. In this
regard, the conclusion that it is the decrease of flame temperature
in the H radical abundant region that causes the reduction of soot
precursors in the high Z st flame, becomes more evident.

4.3. Influences of strain rate on sooting structures in CDFs

Due to an accompanying significant entropy decrease [18] , soot
formations is a highly reversible and rate-limiting process; there-
fore  it  can  be  significantly  affected  by  flow  residence  time.  The
characteristic  flow  time  for  flames  under  aerodynamic  straining
(i.e.,  CDF)  is  strain  rate,  which  is  essentially  the  gradient  of  ax-
ial velocity and has a unit of inverse time [549] . Considering that
strain rate is a defining parameter for CDF, it is important to un-
derstand how it can affect sooting structures in CDFs.

Before discussing its effects, it is worthwhile to first clarify the
definition  of  strain  rate,  since  different  researchers  quantify  this
parameter in different ways. As a matter of fact, there is no true
unique definition of strain rate in the counterflow, partly because
of the axial variation of velocity gradient [550] . For studies with

direct measurement of the axial flow field, either with LDV or PIV,
it is a common practice to define the characteristic strain rate as
the absolute value of the measured axial velocity gradient in the
thermal mixing layer of the oxidizer stream [78,462] (the oxidizer
stream is chosen because most CDFs feature a very low stoichio-
metric mixture fraction so that the flame front is typically located
on the oxidizer side of the stagnation plane). Fig. 17 shows a typi-
cal axial velocity profile as measured by Du et al. [551] . The strain
rate was found by fitting the experimental data with a straight line,
as  shown  by  the  dashed  line  in  the  figure.  This  experimentally-
determined  strain  rate  will  hereafter  be  referred  to  as  the  local
L ). In the absence of experimental data, the strain rate
strain rate ( K
may be estimated from nozzle exit velocities ( V
i ) and nozzle sep-
aration distances ( L ), where i can be either fuel (F) or oxidizer (O)
stream. The simplest approach is to assume a potential boundary
condition and write the strain rate as ( V
O )/ L . This definition

plane (i.e., large Reynolds number) [553] . Although experimentally

way to select corresponding experimental conditions for paramet-
ric studies on strain rate effects, as long as the definition is con-
sistent. To avoid confusion when results from different studies are
compared with different strain rate definitions, an explicit defini-
tion of which strain rate was employed will be offered, using the
corresponding symbols. In the present section, only the effects of
strain rate on overall sooting structure will be discussed; detailed
parametric studies will be reviewed in Section 5.5 , where the un-
steady response of soot formation to time-varying strain rates are
also described.

The strong effect of strain rate on sooting structures can be vi-
sualized in Fig. 18 , where the axial profiles of SVF, average particle

As can be seen, in addition to the decrease in peak SVF (a), the
soot zone thickness decreased monotonically, consistent with the
shrinkage in flame thickness as strain rate increased. Indeed, ac-
companying numerical simulation showed that with the increase
in  strain  rate,  the  flame  sheet  and  the  stagnation  plane  were
brought closer together, leaving an increasingly narrower region for
soot growth. Average soot diameters also decreased (b), partially
explained because the increased strain rate reduced time available
for  coagulation  and  surface  growth  between  the  soot  inception
zone and the particle stagnation plane. The volumetric soot mass
growth rate ( ω
V ) also decreased with the increase in strain rate,
caused primarily by the reduced surface area in the more strained
flames. However, the soot mass growth rate per unit surface area
( ω
A ) showed an interesting behavior. In regions close to the flame
front ω
A was higher for flames with higher strain rate, while the
trend became reversed in regions adjacent to the stagnation plane.
The reason lies in the effects of strain rate on temperature profiles.
Although the peak temperature was reduced due to flame weak-
ening as the strain rate increased, in regions closer to the stagna-
tion plane, where soot surface growth peaks, the flame with higher
strain rate actually had a higher temperature. Nevertheless, the ef-

fects of this higher ω
A  were overwhelmed by the lower surface
area, a consequence of decreased PAHs, and thus, less soot nucleus,
finally resulting in lower SVF in flames with higher strain rates.

It is of interests to note here that the reduction of mass growth
rate per unit surface area near the flame front, with an increase in
straining, was also confirmed experimentally by Vandsburger et al.
[554] . In particular, the complementary measurement of the veloc-
ity profiles using LDV allowed the authors to determine the time
derivative  of  soot  concentrations,  which −after  being  normalized
by  the  total  soot  surface  area  as  estimated  from  measured  soot
sizes −gives the soot surface growth rate.

Wang and Chung [91] concluded that the reduction of soot for-
mation with increasing strain rate can be generally explained as:
(1) reduced PAH concentration and soot inception rate, leading to
less soot surface area per unit volume for mass growth to occur;
(2) reduced soot surface growth rate per unit volume; and (3) re-
duced residence time (from inception region to particle stagnation
plane) available for soot surface reactions to take place.

Before  closing  this  subsection,  we  point  out  that  for  an
originally-sooting  CDF,  progressively  higher  strain  rates  (shorter
residence  times)  sequentially  lead  to  the  disappearance  of  soot,
PAH and finally, extinction of the flame [551,555] . In fact, the crit-
ical strain rate at which soot starts to disappear ( K cr ) is frequently
used as a quantitative indicator of the sooting tendency of CDFs.

4.4. Sooting structures of partially-premixed CDFs

In a counterflow configuration, various flame interaction modes
can be realized, including single, double and triple flames [556–
559] ,  depending  on  the  degrees  of  partial  premixing  in  the  fuel
and/or  oxidizer  streams.  Partially-premixed  flames  are  especially
interesting when it comes to soot formation, since the existence
of oxygen in the fuel stream can notably influence soot formation
through its effects on both flame structures and soot chemistry.

Mungekar and Atreya [560–562] investigated the effects of par-
tial premixing of oxygen in the fuel stream on the sooting struc-
tures in methane CDFs for both SF and SFO configurations. Sev-
eral interesting features were reported for SF flames [562] . First, all
the partially-premixed flames investigated featured double flames,
with  the  sooting  zones  sandwiched  between  the  premixed  (PF)
and non-premixed (NP) reaction zones, as schematically shown in
Fig. 19 (b-d). Second, with an increase in the level of premixing
(as the equivalence ratio in the fuel stream φ decreased from in-
finity  to  φ = 3.4),  the  diffusion  flame  front  moved  closer  to  the
gas stagnation plane (marked as SP), because of fuel dilution and
consumption by oxygen. In addition, the separation distance be-
tween the premixed and non-premixed flame front increased. This
is because the rich premixed flame sheet tended to move to the
fuel nozzle with the addition of oxygen, which can be explained
by considering the balance between the stretched laminar flame
speed and the incoming reactant velocity [563] . In particular, the
flame speed of the premixture was increased due to oxygen ad-
dition so that the premixed flame sheet adjusted itself to a loca-
tion with higher incoming reactant speed (i.e., closer to the fuel
boundary). Third, the peak soot volume fraction ( f v ) and the soot

zone  thickness  decreased  and  then  increased  again  with  the  in-
crease in the level of partial premixing. As explained by the au-
thors [561,562] , the initial decrease in soot zone thickness (from
φ = ∞ to 4.5) was due to the shift of the diffusion flame towards
the gas stagnation plane; subsequent increase (from φ = 4.5 to 3.4)
was the result of increased spatial distance between the premixed
and diffusion flame front, in which the soot zone was sandwiched.
As to the variation of soot volume fraction, the authors attributed
the initial reduction of f v  to the dilution and chemical effects of
oxygen addition. As more oxygen was added, however, the flame
structure changed significantly because the location of peak tem-
perature  moved  closer  to  the  stagnation  plane,  resulting  in  in-
creased  temperature  and  longer  soot  residence  time  in  the  soot
formation region. Consequently, peak f v  increased again as φ de-
creased from 4.5 to 3.4. Compared to the case of φ = ∞ ( Fig. 19 a),
a considerable amount of OH radicals existed in the soot zone for
the partially-premixed case with φ = 3.4. This led to the different
sooting behavior: The soot particles leaked out near the stagnation
plane for case of φ = ∞ , while they became oxidized when passing
through the OH zone for φ = 3.4.

For the SFO flames [561] with diffusion flame on the fuel side
of the stagnation plane, partial premixing in the fuel side resulted
in a monotonic reduction of SVF. These results again support the
importance of flame structure changes on soot evolution.

In this section only the effect of partial-premixing on overall
sooting structures is addressed. More detailed discussions on how
partial premixing affects soot chemistry and quantitative soot load-
ing will be discussed in a later section, when it will be seen that
the effects can be drastically different for flames with different fu-

5. Soot formation in counterflow diffusion flames: Parametric
studies

Next follows a thorough review of parametric soot studies per-
formed in counterflow diffusion flames. Through a comprehensive
search of the literature, more than 100 articles have been identi-
fied and classified into six categories, based on the research ob-
jectives  of  these  studies.  These  studies  generally  focused  on  ex-
amining various factors that affect soot formation and include the
effects  of  (1)  fuel  types,  (2)  dilution,  (3)  pressure,  (4)  tempera-
ture,  (5)  strain  rate,  and  (6)  other  parameters  such  as  radiation
heat  loss  and  electric  field.  For  ease  of  reference  Table  1  lists
all  relevant  studies  ordered  by  year  of  publication.  For  each  in-
dividual study, fuel types, measured/predicted properties, diagnos-
tic/numerical techniques, and the primary research objectives are
listed. Note that several studies have more than one objective, such
cases are grouped based on their primary objective of study, thus
appearing only  once  in  the  list.  Nevertheless, they  can  be  refer-
enced in different sub-sections in discussions that follow. Before
examining the details, it is useful to summarize some general as-
pects of the factors that influence soot formation.

Generally, fuel molecular structures and additives determine py-
rolysis products, thus affecting soot inception, surface growth and
oxidation  mainly  through  the  influence  on  intermediate  radical
pools. As a controlling parameter for any kinetic process, tempera-
ture affects almost the entire soot formation process. Pressure and
dilution influence soot inception and particle-particle coagulation
by altering the concentration of important gaseous intermediates,
as well as soot particles. Soot formation can also be significantly
affected  by  flow  field  characteristics,  primarily  through  their  in-
fluence on flame structures, fuel/air mixing, strain rate and flame
interactions. The electrical field may alter the flow field through
ionic wind effects, also affecting soot formation, in addition to its
potential role in altering the coagulation efficiency of charged soot
particles.

5.1. Effects of fuel types on soot formation

It is natural to imagine that certain fuels are inherently more
sooting than others, and it is generally accepted that fuel molecu-
lar structure plays a vital role in determining the sooting tendency
of a combustion system [96,641] . This point could be best viewed
from the fact that flames fueled with different isomers may exhibit
significantly different sooting characteristics, although they share
similar flame temperature, C/O ratio, and other flow field param-
eters. For instance, in counterflow flames of neat fuels and syn-
O,0 = 0.25), it was observed that the soot volume frac-
thetic air ( X
tion of iso-butane flame was three times as much as that of n-
butane flame, although the two flames had nearly the same peak
temperatures [113] .

Fundamental  understanding  of  the  effect  of  fuel  molecular
structure on soot formation requires comprehensive knowledge of
the kinetic pathways from the fuel to the molecular soot precur-
sors, as well as the interactions between the pool of intermedi-
ate species and the soot surface growth. An important way to ob-
tain such information is through numerical simulations with a de-
tailed chemistry. Because of its simple quasi one-dimensional na-
ture of flow field, the CDF configuration is particularly amenable
to such detailed computation. In general, there are two types of
studies that focus on fuel effects. Flames can either be established
using neat fuels of the target [635] or various target fuels can be
doped into a baseline flame of −for example −ethylene [6 42,6 43] or
methane [67] .

Before  discussing  individual  investigations,  it  is  important  to
mention here that studies comparing the sooting tendency of dif-
ferent fuels should be considered in view of the changes in other

parameters (e.g. stoichiometric mixture fraction and flame maxi-
mum/adiabatic temperature) that occur when using different fuels.
In fact, it is always important to keep in mind that the conclusion
that we draw from a specific parametric study must be understood
with  the  effects  of  accompanying  variations  of  other  parameters
taken into full consideration.

5.1.1. Counterflow diffusion flames with single component (neat) fuels
Glassman and coworkers are among the pioneers using CDFs to
study the fuel-dependence on soot formation [94,113] . These rel-
atively early studies utilized the configuration in which a flame is
established in the forward stagnation region of a cylindrical porous
burner, as schematically shown in Fig. 20 (a). In Ref. [113] , a uni-
O,0 = 0.25)  was  set  to  approach  the
form  flow  of  synthetic  air  ( X
porous  burner  with  a  free-stream  velocity  of  30 cm/s.  The  mea-
surements were made along the centerline for axial velocity, tem-
perature, and soot volume fraction/size/number density using LDV,
thermocouples, and light extinction/scattering techniques, respec-
tively.  Propane,  n-butane,  and  iso-butane  fuels  were  tested,  and
the soot-related results are summarized in Fig. 20 (b). Note that
in the original work [113] , additional flames of alkene fuels such
as ethylene and propene were also established; however, the ox-
idizer  concentrations  ( X
O,0 )  used  were  different  than  those  used
for alkane fuels, making a direct comparison of sooting tendencies
across these different fuel classes difficult. Therefore, only the re-
sults for alkane fuels are re-plotted in Fig. 20 .

As can be seen, the iso-butane flame generated the highest level
of  soot,  followed  by  propane  and  n-butane  (b).  In  addition,  the
higher sooting fuels also produced larger soot particles (c). How-
ever, the number density profiles (d) were confined in a relatively
narrow band and exhibited less variation among the different fu-
els, believed to be consistent with the behavior of a coagulation-
dominated aerosol system. Due to the lack of well-validated soot
mechanisms that were able to handle multiple fuels in the early
years, the authors did not attempt to explain these experimentally-
observed  trends  through  direct  soot  simulations  of  the  CDF.  In-
stead,  inferences  were  taken  from  relevant  iso-thermal  pyrolysis
studies and it was suggested that the sooting tendency was de-
pendent  not  only  on  fuel  pyrolysis  rates  but  also  on  the  inter-
mediate species formed during the pyrolysis process [96,113,644] .
This  observation,  regarding  iso-butane’s  higher  sooting  tendency
as compared to n-butane, was consistent with an earlier ranking
using the smoke point data [645] . It was also corroborated by a
number  of  subsequent  studies  [86,231,620] .  In  particular,  it  was
pointed out that the decomposition of iso-butane leads to rather
high levels of propene and iso-butene [646] , which can be more
readily converted to propargyl, and subsequently to benzene [152] ,
as compared to C
2 species, which are among the major decompo-
sition  products  of  n-butane  [647] .  An  exception  comes  from  the
work  of  Singh  et  al.  [84] ,  where  it  was  observed  that  the  peak
soot volume fraction of the n-butane CDF was notably higher than
F,0 = 0.29,
that of iso-butane flame under the same conditions of X
E = 57 s −1 . As an attempt to
O,0 = 0.9, and effective strain rate K
X
rationalize  their  experimental  results,  the  authors  performed  ki-
netic simulations of the respective flames using both the Merchant
[648] and the USC II mechanisms [649] . The numerical results from
the two mechanisms consistently showed that although n-butane
flame  had  a  higher  concentration  of  C
2 ,  it  featured  a  notably
2 H
lower level of C
3 than iso-butane flames. This is consistent with
our previous discussions on the decomposition products of the two
butane isomers. Further considering the importance of the propar-
gyl recombination reaction in forming aromatic species, it was ex-
pected  (and  later  confirmed  by  PAH  LIF  experiments  [441] )  that
iso-butane  would  produce  more  aromatic  soot  precursors.  These
findings allowed the authors to conclude that the ranking of soot
tendencies may not be consistent with concentrations of aromatics

in the inception stage [84,441] . However, further research is still
needed to clarify the details of how the trends became reversed
during soot growth processes.

Using an opposed-nozzle counterflow configuration, Wang and
Chung  [620]  performed  experimental  work  on  the  sooting  limit
to  rank  the  sooting  tendencies  of  various  C
4  gaseous  hydro-
carbons.  The  results  showed  that  for  SF  flames,  propane  and  n-
butane  have  comparable  sooting  tendencies,  which  are  notably
higher than those of methane and ethane. In addition, the soot for-
mation with C
3 alkene fuels was significantly higher than
ethane  and  propane,  respectively,  and  the  branched  iso-butane
was more sooting than its normal-chain counterparts. Kalvakala et
al.  [377]  computationally  investigated  the  effects  of  fuel  unsatu-

ration  on  soot  formation  by  comparing  the  predicted  peak  soot
volume fraction among counterflow diffusion flames of ethylene,
propane, and propene. In agreement with the experimental results
of Wang and Chung [620] , they observed that the computed soot-
ing  tendency  follows  propene  >  ethylene  >  propane,  regardless
of the stoichiometric mixture fractions at which the comparisons
were made [377] . Accompanying kinetic simulations conducted at
O,0 = 0.21 demonstrated that the major benzene for-

mation pathway was similar in both propane and propene flames,
being the recombination of propargyl radicals. As such, their differ-
ent sooting tendency was largely a result of the different capabil-
ity of the respective fuel pyrolysis products in forming propargyl
radicals. Due to the presence of the double bond, the C-H bond

The effects of unsaturation on PAH/soot formation were also in-
7 hydrocarbon fuels (n-heptane and 1-heptene) in
vestigated for C
CDFs [610,611] . Utilizing a detailed reaction mechanism and a PAH-
based soot model, Fu et al. [610] showed that 1-heptene flame has
a  consistently  higher  soot  number  density,  average  particle  size,
and soot volume fraction as compared to the n-heptane flame, al-
though both flames had very similar heat release characteristics.
Furthermore,  the  numerical  results  also  indicated  that  the  exis-
tence of the double bond exerted increasingly pronounced effects
on PAH and soot formation as the flame strain rates and/or levels
of fuel stream partial premixing increased.

Alkene fuels are important constituents of practical hydrocar-
bon fuels [650,651] ; they are also key intermediates during alkane
oxidation  and  pyrolysis  [652] .  As  such,  detailed  knowledge  of
alkene combustion is required if the combustion and pollutant for-
mation mechanisms of more practical fuels are to be understood.
Motivated by this, Wang et al. [635] performed a systematic in-

In  addition  to  the  above  studies  focusing  on  conventional
hydrocarbon  fuels,  there  are  also  CDF-based  investigations  on
PAH/soot formation of oxygenated/bio-derived fuels. For instance,

al.  [601]  quantified  the  mole  fractions  of  stable  intermediate

which have a pronounced tendency to form aromatic species −and

2 ) and observed that tert-
butanol was the most sooting fuel, followed in decreasing order by
n-butanol, iso-butanol, and sec-butanol. Although their results re-
garding the relative sooting tendency between n-butanol and iso-
butanol (i.e., n-butanol is more sooting than iso-butanol) differed
from previous studies in premixed flames [231] and yield soot in-
dex (YSI) rankings measured in coflow diffusion flames [653] , the
authors did observe that iso-butanol had a higher tendency than
n-butanol to form small-sized PAHs, consistent with quantitative
benzene measurements in coflow diffusion flames [646,654] . Inter-
estingly,  LIF  signals  with  longer  detection  wavelength  ( > 450 nm,
typically believed to represent larger PAHs of more than four rings)
showed that n-butanol has a greater tendency to form larger PAHs
[441] , in agreement with the ranking for sooting tendency. While
no definite explanations were provided of this interesting trend re-
O,0 of
versal, it must be pointed out that in Ref. [441] , due to large X
0.9, the flames from Singh and coworkers featured a rather differ-
ent stoichiometric mixture fraction, and thus different flame struc-
tures, than the coflow fuel-air flames. It is likely that the ranking
of sooting tendencies are dependent upon flame structures.

methyl-crotonate flame consistently produced higher levels of un-
saturated species, such as C
6 , as well
2 , 1-C

as C
6 , and is thus believed to have a higher propensity to soot
than  the  methyl-butanoate  flame.  In  a  step  further,  Feng  et  al.
[82] systematically measured the soot concentrations in CDFs for
a  class  of  model  biodiesel  fuels,  emphasizing  the  effects  of  the
type of ester functional group, number of carbon atoms, and dou-
ble bonds. Since some of the fuels tested were of high molecular
weight (up to methyl-undecanoate), and thus with rather low va-
F,0 ∼0.1) to
por pressure, these fuels were highly diluted with N
maintain a moderate partial pressure. To promote soot formation
for sensitive measurements, pure oxygen was used as the oxidizer
stream, which rendered the flames with SFO characteristics [73] .
The study, summarized in Fig. 22 , showed that for the same func-
tional ester group, the maximum soot volume fractions in the CDFs
increased with the increase in fuel carbon number. Also, for esters
with the same number of carbon atoms, methyl esters exhibited
less sooting tendency than ethyl esters, and the unsaturated esters
were significantly more sooting than their saturated counterparts.
Nevertheless, the location of the double bond did not notably af-
fect sooting tendencies.

5.1.2. Counterflow diffusion flames with fuel mixtures

It is noted that there are even more studies utilizing fuel mix-
tures than single-component fuels in CDF-based soot investigations
on fuel effects. This popularity of the study of fuel mixing effects

may be attributed to the following: (1) Conventional petroleum-
based  fuels  and  natural  gases  are  always  complex  fuel  mixtures
[656] , making understanding compositional effects on soot forma-
tion of practical importance; (2) The chemical interactions of vari-
ous fuel molecules can sometimes shed light on important kinetic
pathways for soot formation that are elusive in studies of single
component  fuels  (a  notable  example  is  the  synergistic  effects  of
ethylene and propane mixtures on soot formation [528] , detailed
later); (3) The sooting tendencies of some fuels (i.e., high MW aro-
matic fuels) may be too high for accurate experimental determi-
nation of their sooting characteristics, and to study the relative ef-
fects in such cases it is usually beneficial to mix a small amount of
the target fuel to a baseline flame.

5.1.2.1. Effects  of  CO/H 2  addition.  Du  et  al.  [568]  investigated  the
2  addition in the fuel stream on soot incep-
effects of CO and H
10  fuels. Because the
4 H
tion rates in CDFs of C
additives can passively affect soot formation by altering fuel con-
centration  and  flame  temperature  (in  addition  to  directly  influ-
encing  kinetic  reactions),  the  authors  conducted  additional  con-
trast tests by adding inert species with physical properties com-
parable to the target dopant. Of special note is that helium was
used  to  contrast  hydrogen  for  the  isolation  of  the  chemical  ef-
fects  of  the  latter.  This  choice  was  justified,  since  helium  has  a
high diffusivity, similar to H
2 , while it was shown that the pref-
erential diffusion effects of these highly mobile species play im-
portant roles in strained flames [657–659] . The tendency for soot
formation in the CDFs was quantified by the critical (minimum)
local strain rate ( K cr , as measured by laser doppler velocimetry),
at which light scattering signals from soot particles disappear (i.e.,
soot inception is inhibited [551,660] ). Therefore, a higher K cr  im-
plies a stronger sooting tendency. The experimental results, sum-
marized in Fig. 23 , showed that the addition of CO inhibited soot
formation in C
4 flames, while its addition in C
10
flames had an interesting non-monotonic effect. Further analysis
4  flames
showed that CO exerted its soot-inhibitive effects in C
mainly  through  fuel  dilution.  On  the  other  hand,  the  initial  en-
hancement of the sooting tendency with CO addition in C
8 and
10  flames was thought to be caused by its chemical effects
n-C
through reaction CO + OH = CO
2 + H, which may alter the concen-
trations of H and OH radicals that are important for soot forma-
tion and oxidation, respectively. Nevertheless, the authors did not
provide direct evidence of this chemical effect and acknowledged
that such reasoning could not explain the inhibiting behavior of
CO in C
4  flames [568] . Interestingly, in a subsequent study of
coflow diffusion ethylene flames by Guo et al. [387] , a detailed ki-
netic model suggested that in addition to the dilution effect, CO
plays a chemically-enhancing effect on soot formation by: (1) rais-
ing flame temperature; (2) increasing the surface growth rates due
to higher H radical production; and (3) decreasing soot oxidation
due to higher OH radical consumption. They noticed that the over-
all soot production rate was reduced, implying that the dilution ef-
fect was still dominant. However, no further study was conducted
to explain the experimental results of Du et al. [568] that soot in-
10  CDF
ception was enhanced by CO addition in C
flames. CO may have a role in influencing fuel pyrolysis chemistry,
but further studies are needed.

flame temperatures were always enhanced. The following were be-
lieved to offset soot-promoting effects of higher flame temperature
2 addition: (1) In positively stretched flames, the preferen-
from H
tial diffusion effects of H
2 may cause precursor concentration re-
duction,  decreasing  the  rate  of  soot  formation;  (2)  In  the  HACA

the hydrogen abstraction reaction A
2 backward, pre-
venting aromatic radicals (A
i -) from participating in further mass
addition  reactions,  and  leading  finally  to  reduced  soot  precursor
concentrations; (3) The addition of H
2 also decreases the fuel car-
bon supply and thus effectively plays a role of dilution. As previ-
ously mentioned, comparison against helium addition cases may
help isolate the above effects. However, it has been noted that the
relative effectiveness of H
2  and helium in inhibiting soot forma-
tion is not always consistent. For example, in the CDFs of Du et
al. [568] , helium was more effective than hydrogen in suppressing
soot inception for all the three fuels tested, consistent with a study
on methane coflow flames [662] . But studies in ethylene/air coflow
flames [6 63,6 64] showed exactly the opposite, i.e., hydrogen was
more effective than helium in reducing soot formation. Compared
to helium, the addition of hydrogen increases flame temperature

while it may also inhibit PAH/soot HACA growth. Thus, it is highly
likely  that  the  dominating  effect  is  dependent  upon  individual
flame  conditions.  Obviously,  more  studies  are  needed  to  clarify
these interesting phenomena.

Through  visual  observation  of  soot  luminosity,  Choi  et  al.
[624] also noticed a reduction of soot formation by H
2 addition in
ethylene-air CDFs. Thermophoretic sampling of the soot particles
and subsequent analysis with HRTEM showed that the size of the
particles was reduced, while the formation of fullerenic nanostruc-
tures  (represented  by  the  curved  carbon  lamella)  was  enhanced
by  the  addition  of  hydrogen.  However,  the  exact  location  where
soot extraction was performed in the flames was not reported. The
authors postulated that the enhanced curved structure may have

5.1.2.2. Synergistic effects of ethylene-based binary fuel mixtures.  The
influence of fuel-stream mixing of ethylene and propane on soot
formation  was  investigated  by  Hwang  et  al.  [528]  in  CDFs  with
E = 55  s −1  at  various  fuel  mixing  ra-

tios. Soot volume fractions and relative PAH concentrations were
measured  with  light  extinction/scattering  and  laser-induced  flu-
orescence,  respectively.  An  interesting  synergistic  effect  was  ob-
served,  i.e.,  PAH/soot  formation  was  enhanced  in  the  flames  of
ethylene/propane  mixtures  compared  to  both  neat  ethylene  and
neat propane flames. Specifically, the PAH/soot concentrations of
the ethylene-propane flames were observed to increase first and
then decrease with more propane mixing, as can be seen in Fig. 24 .
It was argued that the monotonic changes in flame temperature
and  C
2  concentrations  with  the  propane  mixing  ratio  cannot
explain  such  non-monotonic  variation  in  PAH/soot  formation,  so
that chemical cross-linking between the fuel molecules must play
a  role.  In  this  regard,  kinetic  modelling  of  the  flames  was  con-
ducted and the results showed that the peak concentration of C
3 H
3
(known to be an important benzene precursor [152] ) also exhibited
a non-monotonic variation with the propane mixing ratio. Further
kinetic analysis [528,616] revealed that the relatively low concen-
tration of C
3  in the sooting region of the neat ethylene flame
acted  as  a  bottleneck  to  the  formation  of  aromatic  soot  precur-
sors,  while  with  a  small  amount  of  propane  addition,  the  con-

leading  to  an  enhancement  of  C

particles, the increase in benzene concentration translated to the
observed increase in PAH/soot when a small amount of propane
was added to the ethylene baseline flame. With further increases
in the propane mixing ratio, the concentration of C

notably,  contributing  negatively  to  PAH/soot  growth  through  the
HACA mechanism and leading to a decrease in sooting tendency.

chemistry in PAH growth beyond benzene, Lee et al. [582] mea-
sured  PAH  and  soot  concentrations  in  CDFs  of  ethylene-propane
mixtures  with  a  small  amount  of  benzene  addition  (1.83%,  mo-
lar concentration) to the fuel stream. It was argued that benzene
doping would significantly increase benzene concentration in the
pyrolysis  and  flame  zone,  thereby  mitigating  the  relative  impor-
3  pathways  on  initial  ring  formation  to
tance  of  the  effect  of  C
the ethylene/propane synergistic behaviors. LIF signals, detected at
different wavelengths, showed that although the synergistic effect
nearly disappeared in small aromatic species (represented by LIF
signal with 330 nm detection wavelength), it was still pronounced
in  relatively  larger  PAHs  ( > 400 nm  detection  wavelength).  These
results suggested that adding propane to ethylene affects not only
the incipient ring formation but also PAH growth beyond benzene.
In addition to the influence on benzene formation through C
3 H
3
recombination,  Trottier  et  al.  [665]  argued  (based  on  combined
experimental  and  numerical  investigations  on  soot  formation  in
coflow diffusion flames of binary fuel mixtures) that the increase

This argument was supported by numerical analyses of Liu et al.
[284] , McNesby et al. [101] , and Park et al. [6 6 6] .
It  is  important  to  note  that  for  both  the  C

3  radical,  a  direct  pyrolysis
benzene  formation  pathways,  the  CH
product from propane decomposition, always plays a critical role
in explaining the synergistic effect seen in ethylene-propane mix-
tures. It can thus be reasoned that the sooting tendency of ethy-
lene flame may also be enhanced by other fuel dopants, as long
as  such  dopant  can  decompose  to  produce  appreciable  amounts
3  radicals in the fuel pyrolysis zone. If −as a neat fuel −the
of CH
dopant  also  has  a  lower  sooting  tendency  than  ethylene,  syn-
ergistic  effects  are  then  expected  to  develop  between  ethylene
and  this  dopant.  Besides C

soot volume fractions in CDFs of these ethylene-based binary mix-
ture fuels were plotted as a function of molar mixing ratio, after
being normalized by their respective values in the neat ethylene
flames. Although not all the above studies were accompanied by
detailed kinetic investigations, the analyses of reaction pathways
for those with unanimously pointed to the role of CH
3  in induc-
ing synergistic effects (through C
2 interactions, as discussed
previously). The strength of the synergistic effects (i.e., the quanti-
tative extent by which the dopant can increase PAH/soot forma-
tion as compared to the ethylene baseline flame) were seen to be
largely dependent on the relative ease for the dopant to decom-
pose to CH
3 radicals in the flame pyrolysis zone. For instance, the
fact  that  5%  of  propane  addition  in  ethylene  CDF  increased  the
peak  SVF  by  32%  (larger than  the  14%  as  induced  by  5%  ethane
addition) can be partially explained by the higher CH
3 concentra-
tion in the case of propane doping [140] . The stronger synergis-
tic  effect  on  benzene  and  soot  formation  of  ethylene/DME  mix-
ture than in ethylene/ethanol mixture flames can also be rational-
ized by the higher production rates of CH
3 in DME pyrolysis than
ethanol [642] .

was rather small compared to cases with other dopants (e.g., C

CH

(483.6 kJ/mol) in CH

especially in the low temperature region (10 0 0 −150 0 K, fuel side of
the flame) where PAHs were formed. Therefore, the concentration
3  in the methane mixing case was rather low, resulting in
of CH
the weaker synergistic effect on PAH formation compared to other
cases. Second, the flame with CH
4  mixing has lower flame tem-
2  concentrations, which in turn lead to a lower
perature and C
2 H

soot surface HACA growth rate than in the C

4 mix-
ing cases. The slight increase in PAH concentration with CH
ing could not compensate for this reduction in surface growth rate
and, finally, a decrease in soot loading resulted. It is worthwhile
to contrast this monotonic decrease of SVF in CDFs to an earlier
investigation using coflow experiments, where a notable synergis-
tic effect of ethylene and methane mixture was observed on peak
centerline soot volume fraction [668] . Although the difference may
have been caused by the different time-temperature histories en-
countered between the counterflow and coflow configurations, it
was  noted  that  in  the  coflow  study  [668]  the  fuel  was  progres-
4  to the neat CH
sively less diluted with N

case, so that the different level of dilution may also play a role.
More studies are required to unravel this discrepancy.

soot volume fraction and PAH LIF signals showed only a trend of
monotonic decrease [100] , which can be understood since all of the
above base fuels can −by themselves −produce appreciable amounts
3 from DME de-
of CH
composition. One notable exception that cannot be explained by
this  reasoning  is  the  synergistic  effects  of  methane  and  ethane
mixtures, as observed in coflow diffusion flames of Trottier et al.
[665] . However, considering that no quantitative soot volume frac-
tion data or kinetic explanation was provided in Ref. [665] with
respect to this fact, it may be interesting to perform additional ex-
perimental and kinetic modelling studies to confirm such a trend
in CDFs.

As  demonstrated  above,  non-monotonic  variation  of  PAH  and
soot  concentrations  with  mixing  ratio  have  been  widely  ob-
served in both counterflow and coflow [71,284] diffusion flames of
ethylene-based binary fuel mixtures. However, the situation in pre-
mixed flames can be drastically different. For instance, Wu et al.
[103] measured PAH and soot in rich premixed flames of ethylene-
ethanol  mixtures  and  observed  that  ethanol  addition  monotoni-
cally decreased soot formation. Similar observations were made by
Salamanca et al. [607] for ethylene-ethanol, and by Sirignano et al.
[90] for ethylene-DME premixed flames. These interesting results
suggest that physicochemical pathways of PAH/soot formation for
the same fuels can differ notably, depending on flame conditions.
A hint of such dependence (in particular, the presence (absence)
of  the  synergistic  effects  of  ethylene-based  binary  fuels  in  non-
premixed  (premixed)  flames)  may  be  found  in  the  results  from
partially-premixed CDFs. Hwang et al. [165] found that the non-
monotonic variation of soot volume fraction in CDFs of ethylene-
propane mixtures can be mitigated −and even eliminated −by pre-
mixing  the  fuel  stream  with  oxygen.  The  explanation  lay  in  the
fact  that  with  an  oxidizer  present  in  the  fuel  stream,  the  oxy-
2 to form
gen atom may react in the fuel pyrolysis zone with C
2 + CO),  which  in  turn  interacts  with
2  radical  (C
CH
2  to form the important benzene precursor, propargyl radical
2 H
C
3 + H). In such a way, the bottleneck of benzene
2 + CH
(C

formation,  caused  by  the  deficiency  of  C
4
flame,  can  be  effectively  removed  and  as  a  result,  the  partially-
premixed C
4 flame would not be as sensitive to additional CH
3
from propane decomposition, mitigating the synergistic effect. Al-
though yet to be confirmed, the monotonic decrease in soot con-
centration in ethylene-ethanol [103] and ethylene-DME premixed
flames [90] is thought to be explainable by this mechanism.

5.1.2.3. Surrogates  for  practical  fuels.  Practical  fuels  are  complex
mixtures of hundreds of hydrocarbons [656,669–672] that prohibit
kinetic simulation with detailed chemistry models. Therefore, sim-
plified surrogates with a relatively small number of components
are needed to represent various physical and chemical properties
of real fuels. As a critical fuel property, the sooting tendency is an
important consideration in surrogate development [673,674] , ratio-
nalizing the wide interest in the compositional effects of surrogate
fuels on soot formation. Often the studies of surrogate fuels were
performed  by  doping  a  small  amount  of  the  surrogate  into  the
baseline flames of simple hydrocarbons (i.e., methane or ethylene),
so that the compositional effect could be better isolated from other
non-chemical  factors,  such  as  flame  temperature  and  flow  fields
[123,675,676] . In addition, the risk of fuel vapor re-condensation
can be minimized since the partial pressure of a target fuel may
be rather small [677] . This point is particularly important for fuel
components with a high molecular weight, and thus, a high boiling
temperature.

With in-flame gas sampling and GC/MS analysis, Bufferand et
al.  [677]  compared  the  detailed  chemical  structures  of  methane
counterflow diffusion flames doped with 10 0 0 ppm of real jet fuel
and  a  corresponding  six-component  surrogate  (Utah/Yale  surro-
gate).  With  highly-diluted  non-sooting  flames  to  facilitate  probe
sampling,  the  experimental  data  showed  that  the  jet  fuel-doped
flame produced notably more benzene and toluene (more than a
factor of two) than the surrogate-doped flame, although the sur-
rogate was seen to capture other general jet fuel behavior reason-
ably well. In a follow-up work, Jahangirian et al. [80] investigated
incipiently  sooting  ethylene  counterflow  diffusion  flames  doped
with  20 0 0 ppm  of  jet  fuel  and  two  surrogates  (six-component
Utah/Yale surrogate [677] and two-component Aachen surrogate).
Good agreement was observed between the real fuel and the sur-
rogates in terms of peak location and magnitude of benzene con-
centration. With respect to toluene formation, the Utah/Yale surro-
gate performed better in mimicking the behavior of real jet fuel.
Nevertheless, it was concluded that both surrogates exhibited ac-
ceptable agreement with real fuel in terms of aromatic formation
under incipient sooting conditions.

Realizing  the  lack  of  fundamental  studies  in  non-premixed
flames  of  critical  transport/surrogate  fuel  components,  Carbone
and  Gomez  conducted  a  series  of  investigations  on  the  chemi-
cal  structures  of  CDFs  doped  with  hundreds  of  ppm  of  toluene
[606] , 1,2,4-trimethyl benzene (TMB) [609] , n-decane [617] and n-
decane/TMB mixtures [621] . In these studies, two baseline flames
(i.e., a non-sooting methane SFO flame and an incipiently sooting
ethylene  SF  flame)  with  significantly  different  thermal-chemical
environments were used as flame reactors to provide well-defined
(and  contrasting)  environments  for  the  examination  of  reaction
pathways  of  the  target  fuels.  Profiles  of  flame  temperature  and
mole fractions of important intermediate species were measured
with thermocouples and GC/MS techniques, respectively. Analysis
of the experimental data, together with numerical results obtained
with literature-based kinetic mechanisms, also provided direction
for future improvement of chemical models, especially in the ap-
plication of non-premixed flame coupling kinetics and transport.

The addition of benzene and toluene was confirmed to enhance
soot/PAH formation, with toluene exhibiting stronger effects, which
was consistent with the higher sooting tendency of toluene [678] .
Kinetic analyses revealed that in toluene-doped flames, the forma-

With  similar  measurement  techniques,  the  sooting  character-
istics  of  n-heptane,  iso-octane  and  toluene,  components  of  the
widely-used toluene primary reference fuel (TPRF), were studied in
CDFs by Choi et al. [447] . Both SF and SFO flames were tested and
the liquid fuels were diluted only by N
2 , without employing a base
gaseous fuel. As can be seen in Fig. 26 , the fuel and oxidizer dilu-
F,0 = 0.30 and
tion levels for the SF flames were somewhat high ( X
O,0 = 0.21),  so  the  flame  was  non-sooting  when  neat  n-heptane

or  iso-octane  was  the  fuel.  Soot  loading  was  monotonically  in-
creased as more toluene was added, and the behavior was quali-
tatively similar between n-heptane/toluene and iso-octane/toluene
mixtures. Note, however, that the effect of toluene addition only
became  significant  when  the  toluene  ratio  ( R
T )  was  larger  than
0.4.  On  the  other  hand,  interesting  non-monotonic  variations  of
PAH concentrations (represented by the intensities of PAH LIF sig-

nals)  with  R
were  qualitatively  captured  by  kinetic  modelling  using  a  mech-

5.1.3. Quantitative indices of sooting tendencies

The above discussions demonstrate that fuel molecular struc-
tures are critical in determining soot production. This has impor-
tant implications for the prediction of soot emissions from practi-
cal combustion devices which typically burn real fuels (i.e., diesel
and jet fuels) with very complex compositions [669,670] . It is com-
mon  for  current  predictive  tools  to  use  surrogates  to  represent
real fuels [669,670,673] , making a quantitative index necessary to
assess whether the sooting tendencies among them are matched
[680] .  A  sooting  index  can  also  be  helpful  for  comparing  soot-
ing  tendencies  among  fuels  with  different  functional  groups,  so
that statistical information on the relation between fuel molecular
structure and sooting tendency can be obtained [678,6 81,6 82] . This
sub-section briefly reviews available sooting indices, with particu-
lar focus on the sooting temperature index (STI), which is based on
sooting limits of counterflow diffusion flames.

Sooting  metrics  have  been  proposed  for  pyrolysis,  premixed,
and non-premixed combustion conditions. Crossley et al. [683] py-
rolyzed  20  μL  of  vaporized  liquid  samples  in  an  alumina  bed
at  850 oC  and  quantified  the  amount  of  carbon  deposition  with
a temperature-programmed oxidation system. By normalizing the
soot  deposition  of  different  fuel  samples  to  two  reference  com-
pounds, a micropyrolysis index (MPI) was proposed, which was be-
lieved to provide information on the tendency of a particular fuel
to soot through oxygen-free pyrolysis (i.e., independent of heating
value, oxidation chemistry, oxidizing environment, and etc.).

For premixed systems, critical equivalence ratios, or C/O ratios
at which soot luminosity can be visually detected, were frequently
used as a quantitative metric [119,645,684] . Considering that un-
der fuel-rich conditions, fuel carbon is converted primarily to CO
instead of CO
2 , a critical effective equivalence ratio was also pro-
posed [685] , based on the stoichiometric relation in which CO and
H

2 O were the combustion products.

Sooting tendencies in non-premixed systems have been histor-
ically  quantified  using  smoke  point,  which  is  the  height  of  the
highest flame without soot leakage when the test fuel is burned
in a wick-fed lamp [686] , or in a coflow burner (for gaseous fu-
els)  [104,117] .  Laminar  co-flow  jet  flames  are  characterized  by  a
buoyancy-controlled velocity field so that the velocity at a given
height above the burner is proportional to the square root of the
height, while reasonably independent of the fuel outlet velocity or
volumetric flow rate [66] . As a result, as the fuel flow rate (or out-
let  velocity)  increases,  the  flame  becomes  longer,  increasing  the
fuel residence time, which in turn enhances the sooting propen-
sity of the flame. There exists a critical flame height above which
soot formed in the fuel-rich region of the flame cannot be fully oxi-
dized and smoke begins to pierce from the flame front to emit into
the environment. This critical flame height is typically defined as
the smoke point. Obviously, fuels with a lower smoke point have a
higher tendency to soot and there is a historical sooting index that
was defined to be inversely proportional to the smoke point [687] .
Quantitative determination of the critical flame height (i.e., the
smoke point) is somewhat subjective and can vary from one in-
strument  to  another.  Furthermore,  as  more  oxygen  is  needed  to
form  a  stoichiometric  fuel/oxidizer  condition  at  the  flame  front
higher molecular weight fuels naturally have longer flame [680] ,
irrespective their sooting tendencies. In this regard, smoke point is
affected by both the sooting tendency and the molecular weight of
the fuel. In an effort to reduce this undesirable molecular weight
effect, Calcote and Manos [645] introduced the threshold soot in-
dex (TSI), with a scale of 0 (ethane) to 100 (naphthalene), where
higher values mean higher sooting propensity. This index is a nor-
malization of smoke point data as given by:

+ b

(24)

(cid:3)
T SI = a

(cid:4)
MW
SP

where  MW  is  the  molecular  weight  of  the  test  fuel,  SP  is  the
smoke  point  and  a  and  b  are  apparatus-specific  constants.  Note
that by considering the linear relationship between flame height
and fuel volumetric flow rate, SP can also be replaced by the crit-
ical fuel volumetric flow rate in Eq. (24) for the definition of TSI.
Despite its wide use, TSI is just one way among many to normal-
ize smoke point data. Arguing that the direct inclusion of MW in
sooting index definition is not physically motivated, Li and Sunder-
land [688] revisited smoke point data and proposed a new soot-
ing metric called the normalized smoke point (NSP). Barrientos et
al. [681] proposed the oxygen extended sooting index (OESI) for
oxygenated fuels to account for the effect of oxygen atoms in the
normalization of smoke point data.

Another sooting index that received widespread attention is the
yield  sooting  index  (YSI),  as  pioneered  by  McEnally  and  Pfefferle
[689] . They doped target fuels in a methane coflow diffusion flame
and measured the peak soot volume fraction, which was then nor-
malized to determine YSI [67,653,678,690,691] . YSI was tradition-
ally obtained by measuring SVF using the LII technique, and a more
recent study [692] has shown that the techniques of color-ratio py-
rometry and spectral soot emission are also compatible. In addi-
tion, measured YSI values were also unvarying across flame con-
ditions with different temperatures and levels of partial premix-
ing, suggesting the robustness of YSI to be used across a range of
premixed and temperature conditions relevant to soot formation
[692] .

flame boundaries.

The above indices (except the MPI) are based on either coflow
or smoke point flames in which undiluted fuel and air were typ-
ically used. Recent research in novel combustion techniques such
as oxygen-enriched combustion, low temperature combustion and
flameless combustion [693] necessitates the study of the effects of
fuel and oxidizer stream dilution on sooting characteristics of dif-
fusion flames. Furthermore, considering soot formation is a rate-
limiting process [554] , and therefore sensitive to the characteristic
flow time scale, it would be ideal if the effects of residence time
are reflected in the sooting index. In coflow diffusion flames, the
residence time is typically too long to represent combustion un-
der practical conditions [114] ; challenges also exist for its active
control. In addition, as discussed in a previous section, in coflow
flames, soot once formed will be convected toward the oxidizing
zone where soot oxidation takes place, behaving as a soot forma-
tion/oxidation (SFO) flame. In such a case, the smoke point is es-
sentially a critical condition when soot formation and oxidation are
balanced. However, to quantify the sooting tendency for various fu-
els, it may be helpful to avoid the interference from soot oxidation.
CDF is a flame configuration that can provide valuable informa-
tion regarding residence time effects on soot formation; because
it is relatively easy to parameterize the strain rate (inversely pro-
portional to residence time) by adjusting the nozzle exit velocities.
Also, by utilizing SF flames, it is possible to separate the soot for-
mation  process  from  oxidation.  The  sooting  tendencies of  differ-
ent fuels have been systematically studied in CDFs in the form of
sooting limit curves [620] . An example sooting limit map is shown
in Fig. 27 for various C

be sooting or non-sooting by varying the amount of N
in the fuel or oxidizer stream (detailed discussion on dilution ef-
fect on soot formation are presented in Section 5.2 ). Experimen-
tally, whether a CDF is sooting can be determined by comparing
the  Rayleigh  and  Mie  scattering  signals  from  gas  molecules  and
soot  particles,  respectively.  As  detailed  in  Ref.  [614] ,  under  non-
sooting conditions the Raleigh scattering intensity varies monoton-
ically from the fuel to the oxidizer stream due to the change in
the scattering cross-section of gases. Once soot is formed, the Mie
scattering signal from soot is embedded in the Rayleigh signal, re-
sulting in a local maximum. The presence of this local maximum
is indicative of the onset of soot.

els. For example, the sooting region for C

larger than their alkane counterparts and iso-butane has a more
extended  sooting  zone than  n-butane.  These  are consistent  with
the known fact that, in diffusion flames, alkenes are generally more
sooting  than  alkanes  [99] ,  and  branched  alkanes  are  more  soot-
ing than those with straight chains (with the same carbon num-
ber) [688] . A more interesting observation can be made when re-

existence of a threshold temperature for the onset of soot forma-

ature above this threshold, and vice versa. What is more important
is that the threshold temperature is highly dependent on the fuel
type, with less sooting fuel featuring a higher threshold tempera-
ture at the sooting limit.

tive means for ranking the sooting tendency of different fuels. To
demonstrate and validate the possibility for its use as a quantita-
cr;SF and the threshold
tive sooting index, the correlation between T
soot index (TSI) is presented in Fig. 29 , where good correlation can
be seen. This suggests that T
cr;SF determined from counterflow ex-
periments can be a viable metric for sooting propensity. Note that
the uncertainties of determining T
cr;SF are considerably lower than
that for TSI.

By normalizing T

a similar manner as used for YSI, a sooting temperature index (STI)
can  be  defined.  This  CDF-based  sooting  index  has  the  following
novel features compared to smoke point-based ones: (1) It quanti-

ing is too excessive to be fully oxidized; (2) In the test environ-
ment for SF flames, interference from soot oxidation is absent, so
the sooting tendency can be assessed purely on the fuel’s chem-
ical reactivity to form soot; (3) The effect of residence time can
easily be incorporated quantitatively in STI, by measuring sooting
limits with different nozzle exit velocities. A sooting sensitivity in-
dex (SSI) was also proposed by normalizing the slope of T

Finally, it may also be noteworthy that the approach used to
develop YSI [689] (i.e., doping a small amount of test fuel in a base
flame and measure the peak SVF) can also be applied to CDF, and
further efforts are needed to quantify the dependence of sooting
tendency data especially on pressure.

5.2. Effects of dilution and non-hydrocarbon additives on soot
formation

2  and H

The identification of soot-inhibiting non-fuel additives is an im-
portant  research  area  for  practical  purposes  [564] .  For  example,
flue  gas  recirculation  (FGR),  which  is  essentially  the  addition  of
CO
2 O in reactants, is frequently used in utility boilers as
a measure for emission reduction [694] . Similarly, exhaust gas re-
circulation (EGR) is widely adopted in internal combustion engines.
Oxy-fuel combustion is also actively explored to reduce the cost of
2 sequestration. It is of fundamental interests to understand the
CO
underlying mechanisms on how these additives affect soot forma-
tion. Typical non-hydrocarbon additives include inert gases such as
nitrogen, argon, helium, carbon dioxide, and water vapor, as well as
oxidizing agents of oxygen (i.e., partial-premixing), ozone, and ni-
trogen dioxide. The influences of organometallic and halogenated
compounds on soot formation have also attracted research inter-
ests. In this section, relevant studies conducted with laminar coun-
terflow flames are reviewed and discussed.

5.2.1. Nitrogen and noble gas addition

The  effect  of  nitrogen  dilution  in  oxidizers  was  studied  by
Vandsburger  et  al.  [94]  in  counterflow  diffusion  flames  of  ethy-
lene and propane, stabilized in the forward stagnation region of a
cylindrical porous burner. The level of oxidizer dilution was quan-

profiles of axial velocity (LDV), temperature (thermocouples), and
soot volume fraction, number density, and average diameter (light
extinction and scattering) were all measured along the stagnation
streamline.  The  results  showed  that  for  ethylene  flames,  the  in-
crease in X
O,0 from 0.18 to 0.28 resulted in increases in the max-
imum  flame  temperature  (1750 K  to  2150 K)  and  peak  soot  vol-
ume fractions (from 3.7 × 10 −7  to 2.1 × 10 −6 ). Maximum parti-
cle number densities (maximum particle sizes) were measured to
occur  close  to  the  flame  front  (stagnation  plane),  and  increased
O,0 . Propane flames exhibited similar behavior with
slightly with X
respect  to  the  effect  of  X
O,0 ,  although  soot  loading  was  notably
lower compared to ethylene. Hwang and Chung [281] performed
similar experiments in ethylene SF CDFs and found that both soot
and  PAH  formation  were  enhanced  with  the  increase  in  X
O,0 .  In
O,0  investigated was ex-
a more recent work [614] , the range of X
F,0 = 1), and similarly,
tended further, up to 0.5 for ethylene CDF ( X
a monotonic increase in soot loading with increased X
O,0 was ob-
served. In a counterflow diffusion flame with neat methane as the
fuel stream, Beltrame et al. [576] increased X
O,0 from 0.21 all the
way to 1.0 (pure oxygen). Their experimental and numerical results
agreed, showing a monotonic increase in peak soot volume frac-
tion. As a related fact, it is interesting that Kennedy and cowork-
ers also observed the formation of multi-walled carbon nanotubes
[506,695] , as well as fullerenes [696] in methane or acetylene CDFs
with oxygen-enriched oxidizer.

At first glance, it is intriguing that an increase in oxygen con-
O,0 ) would strengthen soot for-
tent in the oxidizer stream (i.e., X
mation. It might seem that the increased amount of oxygen would
enhance soot oxidation, and therefore, result in lower soot produc-
tion. This can be true for over-ventilated coflow diffusion flames,
where the final soot loading is determined by competing effects
of soot production in the fuel-pyrolysis zone, and subsequent soot
oxidation in the oxygen-rich post-flame zone. For example, Glass-
man and Yaccarino [697] found that the sooting tendency of ethy-
lene coflow diffusion flame (represented by the normalized sooting
flame height) decreased as X
O,0 increased from 0.16 to 0.24, which
O,0  resulted  in  a  higher

soot burn-up rate. However, all the counterflow flames mentioned
above are of the SF type, so that the flame was stabilized on the
oxidizer side of the stagnation plane. As discussed in a previous
section, in such cases the soot particles would be transported away
from the oxidizing flame sheet so that soot oxidation was largely
absent. Higher X
O,0  would lead to higher temperatures in the re-
acting flame front as well as in the fuel pyrolysis zone, enhancing
fuel pyrolysis and soot formation rates [93,698] .

The effect of fuel stream dilution by inert gases has also been
studied. Du et al. [568] measured the critical strain rate for soot
inception (i.e., soot inception limit, K cr ) in CDFs of C
8 , and
10  with fuel side dilution by nitrogen and argon. The data
n-C
4 H
for the C
4  flame is re-plotted in Fig. 30 , and other flames ex-
hibit similar qualitative trends. As can be seen, and much as ex-
pected, K cr decreased (i.e., sooting tendency decreased) monotoni-
cally with the increase in the dilution level. Considering that inert
dilution can affect soot formation by variation of either the flame
temperature or the concentration of soot precursors, additional ef-
forts were taken to isolate these effects. In Fig. 30 b, the dashed
line represents the variation of K cr with flame temperature, which
was varied by substituting part of the nitrogen in the oxidizer with
equal  moles  of  argon,  without  altering  the  fuel/oxidizer  dilution
level [699] . In such a way, this line depicts only the thermal effect.
The symbols are data shown in Fig. 30 a, re-plotted as a function of
temperature. Its deviation from the dotted line indicates the inert
affecting soot inception via not only thermal, but dilution effects.
Indeed,  the  decrease  in  K cr  with  N
2 /Ar  addition  was  faster  than
expected from only thermal considerations. At a specified temper-
ature, K cr (in cases with argon dilution), was even lower than those

2 dilution. This can be explained by the fact that more argon
with N
is required than nitrogen for the temperature to be matched, due
to the lower specific heat of argon, so the argon diluted flame has
a higher level of dilution. The importance of concentration modi-
fication in explaining the reduction of soot by inert addition was
also noted in experiments of jet flames [96,700] .

F,0 = 1.0, 0.75 and 0.5 for X

In addition to K cr , sooting characteristics were also compared
carefully in moderately sooting CDFs, with and without fuel stream
inert addition [74] . Soot volume fraction, axial velocity and temper-
ature profiles were experimentally determined for ethylene CDFs
O,0 = 0.21. The dilution and tem-
with X
perature effects were isolated in additional experiments with ma-
nipulation of N
2 /Ar ratio in the oxidizer side, similar to [568] . The
data shown in Fig. 31 , with fixed temperatures, clearly demonstrate
the notable effects of concentration modification on soot forma-
tion. Note, in Fig. 31 , the SVF was plotted against convective time
from the flame front to account for the fuel stream inert addition
that would alter the flame position, and thus the residence time of
soot particles. A further analysis of the slope of SVF with time indi-
cated that the soot production rate varied linearly with initial fuel
F,0 , provided that the flame temperature remained
concentration X
constant.

As previously discussed, sooting limits in CDFs can be repre-
sented by the critical strain rate K cr , beyond which soot scattering

Fig. 32 a. The critical sooting conditions (black squares) in terms of
X

signals are about to appear, similar to the description in [551] . In
subsequent studies, similar soot maps were obtained for various
other fuels and fuel mixtures [614,620] , which were then used to
compare the sooting tendency of these neat, or mixture fuels.

Instead of using light scattering, Naik et al. [581] determined
the  critical  sooting  condition  based  on  visual  inspection  of  the
flame,  so  that  the  first  observation  of  yellow  soot  luminosity
against a darkened background was deemed to be a signal for in-
cipient  soot  formation.  Fig.  32 b  shows  the  soot  map,  developed
with this visual criterion for methane CDFs at a constant global
G of 20 s −1 . A notable difference from light scattering-
strain rate K
based measurements lies in the higher X
O region, where the obvi-
ous bending behavior, observed in the light scattering-based soot-
ing  limit  curve  (a)  is  absent  in  the  visually-based  curve  (b).  Al-
though  the  two  curves  were  measured  for  different  fuels,  later
light scattering-based experiments [620] confirmed that the phe-
nomena  of  bending  in  sooting  limit  curves  are  ubiquitous,  and
the bending is even stronger for low sooting tendency fuels like
methane.

Before explaining this discrepancy, it is helpful to identify sev-
eral important features exhibited by the sooting limit curve shown

F,0  regions  are  rather  different,
haviors  in  the  large  and  small  X
caused by the transitions of flame/sooting structures. This is con-
sistent with the distinction between SF and SFO flames, mentioned
previously;  (2)  In  SF  flames  with  large  X
F,0 ,  the  sooting  limits
closely follow the iso-temperature curve, suggesting that incipient
soot formation is controlled by temperature. On the other hand, in

preciable range of iso-temperature curves, implying that tempera-
ture is not the only factor controlling soot formation in SFO flames;

O,0  approaches  unity,  exhibiting  a  non-monotonic  be-

havior with X
O,0 . Indeed, soot volume fraction measurements and
accompanying  numerical  modelling  results  confirmed  this  non-
monotonic  influence  of  oxidizer  composition  on  soot  formation
F,0  [378] . In particular, it was experimentally
in CDFs with low X
F,0 = 0.28 and an effective strain
shown that for ethylene CDF with X
E of 100 s −1 , the peak SVF first increased—reaching a max-
rate K
imum near X
O,0  increased from
0.7 to 1.0 [378] . Further kinetic analyses revealed that, while in-
creasing X
O,0  suppresses soot inception and enhances soot oxida-
tion (tending to reduce soot production), soot surface growth rates
are enhanced with the increase in X
O,0 , contributing positively to
soot mass concentration. It is these competing effects that lead to
the non-monotonic variation of the sooting tendency with X
O,0 in
SFO flames. Since the visually-based sooting limit curve shows no
sign of bending (implying simply a monotonic dependence), it can
be concluded that visual inspection may not be suitable for judg-
ing the onset of soot—at least for CDFs of SFO types. This is con-
sistent with the findings of Du et al. [551] , that the sooting limits
determined by visual luminosity can be strongly affected by fuel
type and flame geometry, and with Zhang et al. [525] , who pos-

tulated that gaseous PAHs may also be responsible for the yellow
color emissions in CDFs.

Compared to argon and nitrogen, helium has a special feature,
that of high diffusivity. Since species diffusion is always coupled
with chemical kinetics to determine general flame characteristics,
it is reasonable to expect that the soot formation process would
also be noticeably affected by preferential diffusion [701–703] . In
this  regard,  the  effects  of  helium  addition  on  the  sooting  char-
acteristics of diffusion flames have attracted wide research inter-
ests. For instance, McLintock [704] compared the effectiveness of
adding various inert gases in an oxidizer stream in reducing the
sooting propensity of ethylene coflow diffusion flames, and found
helium to be most effective. However, in cases of fuel stream addi-
tion, Glassman and coworkers [705] noticed that helium was even
less effective than argon in inhibiting soot formation of ethylene
coflow flames. Axelbaum et al. [657] proposed an explanation for
these interesting opposing trends based on concentration modifi-
cation: When added to the fuel side, preferential diffusion effects
will cause helium to defocus to a higher extent than argon, due
to the concave curvature of the coflow diffusion flame front (i.e.,
negative stretch) [659] . As a result, concentrations of the fuel and
other fuel-related intermediate species in the helium-diluted flame
will be higher (effectively less diluted) than those in the argon-
diluted  flame,  leading  to  higher  soot  formation  in  the  helium-
diluted flame. The opposite holds when the diluents are added to
the oxidizer side, so that helium will be more focused , resulting in
more effective dilution, and lowering the sooting tendency in the
helium-diluted flame.

In addition to the effects of concentration modification, helium
has a higher thermal diffusivity, so its addition can also cause a
broadening of the temperature profile, which may thermally affect
soot  formation.  By  using  a  positively  stretched  flame,  for  which
temperature  broadening has  the  opposite  effects  (if  any)  to  that
of concentration modification on soot formation, Axelbaum et al.
[657] provided unambiguous evidence to support the dominance of
concentration modification as the underlying mechanism explain-
ing the helium addition effects. In particular, noble gases such as
helium,  argon,  neon,  and  krypton  that  have  similar  heat  capaci-
ties, but progressively lower diffusivities, were added to the fuel
stream (at a molar ratio of 0.2) of positively stretched CDFs. The
results ( Fig. 33 ) showed that peak SVF was lowest in the case of
helium addition for both ethylene and propane flames. Since tem-
perature broadening due to the high thermal diffusivity of helium
would tend to increase soot formation if effective, the experimen-
tal facts can only be explained by composition modifications. Note
that the relative extent of the effects between fuel stream helium
and argon dilutions were expected to be reversed as the signs of
stretch rates changed. This is supported by later experimental in-
vestigations [706] , where the fuel stream addition of hydrogen (a
highly mobile gas, similar to helium) was found be less effective
2  addition in reducing soot production in ethylene coflow
than N
flames, which can also be partly explained by this mechanism, es-
pecially considering that H
2 has an additional chemical role in in-
hibiting soot formation in ethylene flames [662] .

Although typically regarded as non-reactive, CO

participate  in  chemical  reactions  under  high  temperature  flame

help  validate  and  improve  existing  kinetic  models).  Besides,  the
frequent use of exhaust/flue gas recirculation (EGR/FGR) techniques
in practical combustion devices [694,707,708] also motivates such
studies.

phase soot precursors. Annunziata et al. [709] measured the laser-
induced emission (excited at 266 nm) of ethylene CDFs and found
the emissions detected both at 330/440 nm (termed LIF signals by
the authors to represent nanoparticles constituted mainly by aro-
matic compounds) and at 550 nm (termed LII signal to represent
soot aggregates of sizes higher than 10 nm) were significantly re-
duced by the addition of CO

employed in the simulation, which used fictitious CO

fined purely for numerical purposes, as a species that has the same

thermodynamic/transport  properties  with  real  CO
participate in any chemical reactions. Chemical effects of CO

the reduction in flame temperature, C

2 in reducing soot forma-
mechanisms for the chemical role of CO

2  to the oxidizer side was
more  effective  in  inhibiting  sooting  tendencies  than  in  the  fuel
side. However, this study did not directly model PAH/soot forma-
2 mole fraction as an in-
tion, instead it used the changes of C
dex to represent sooting tendency variations. Using the same FCO
2
strategy, Wang and Chung [626] performed PAH-based soot mod-
2 addition on
elling studies to determine the effects of fuel side CO
ethylene CDFs with detailed gas-phase chemistry and the method
of moments to treat particle dynamics. After validation against the
experimental data, numerical results showed that the addition of
2 had chemical effects in: (1) reducing PAH mole fraction, which
CO
in turn decreased soot nucleation rates and number density, and
thus lower surface area for mass-adding reactions, (2) decreasing
hydrogen, methyl, and propargyl radicals, causing lower H abstrac-
tion rates in the production of active surface sites for soot growth,
2 concentrations, and thus the HACA growth
and (3) reducing C
rates per unit surface area. They further measured the sooting lim-

The  above  investigations  in  non-premixed  flames  consistently
showed that CO
2 addition can reduce soot formation, however, it
is of interests to mention that there are also studies that indicated
the opposite. For instance, Abian et al. [707,711] observed that a

25% CO
experiments on temperature-controlled flow reactor fuel pyrolysis,
although  higher  levels  of  CO

2 addition, based on the increased OH radical
with a low level of CO
2 + H = CO + OH,  which  were  expected
concentrations  through  CO
2 O + H. The removal
2 by OH + H
to increase consumption of H
of H
2  will favor H abstraction reactions in the HACA mechanism
for PAH/soot growth and thus leads to higher soot production. At
a higher dilution level, CO
2 may result in a relatively large amount
of OH radicals, which help to oxidize PAHs and soot particles. Sim-
ilar enhancement of soot by CO
2 was seen by Teini et al. [712] in
2 pyrolysis. Further kinetic simulation showed
experiments of C

thus  benzene  by  C

cals,  which  were  also  seen  to  help  abstract  H  atoms  from  PAH
molecules, allowing for further HACA growth. Note that in these
pyrolysis experiments, the thermal effects of CO

because  temperatures  were  held  fixed  in  all  cases,  and  the  re-

Compared  to  CO

fects  of  water  vapor  addition  on  soot  formation  in  CDFs,  prob-
ably  due  to  the  additional  experimental  complications  of  me-
tering and vaporizing liquid water. Equipped with a counterflow
burner  with  the  capability  of  reactant  preheating,  Zhang  et  al.
[525]  found  that  the  addition  of  water  vapor  to  both  the  oxi-
dizer  and  fuel  side  could  reduce  soot  formation,  although  addi-
tion  on  the  oxidizer  side  was  more  effective.  It  was  also  quali-
tatively noticed that water vapor addition was more effective for
soot inhibition than adding the same moles of CO
2 . Although no
detailed kinetic simulation was performed, the authors reasoned
that, with H
2 , the added water produced consid-
erable  amounts  of  OH  radicals,  which  helped  oxidize  molecu-
lar soot precursors. The higher effectiveness of H

CO

5.2.3. Partial-premixing

Partial-premixing refers to the addition of oxygen—either pure
or diluted by inert gases—in the fuel side of a non-premixed com-
bustion system. The level of addition is typically kept low so that
the equivalence ratio of the premixture is much larger than unity
in the fuel stream. Motivation for studying the effect of partial pre-
mixing on soot formation includes the fact that a small amount of
oxygen is frequently present in the fuel side of diffusion flames.
As  an  example,  for  coflow  flames  which  are  widely  adopted  in
studying  soot  formation,  a  reaction  quenching  occurs  in  regions
in close proximity to the nozzle due to excessive heat and radi-
cal losses, so that a small amount of air entrainment is inevitable
[109] . Oxygen penetration into the fuel side can also occur due to
finite  rate  chemistry  (i.e.,  incomplete  combustion)  [660] .  From  a
practical point of view, air is sometimes intentionally co-injected
with fuel in industrial combustion devices, to improve fuel atom-
ization. It was also shown that in diesel engines ahead of the main
diffusion flame zone a fuel-rich premixed region is always present
influencing initial soot formation typically due to a lifted nature
of flame base [718,719] . Furthermore, studies on partial-premixing
may also clarify the underlying mechanisms that can help identify
dominant soot/PAH growth pathways in flames of different fuels.
Notable examples can be seen, for example, in the work of McE-
nally and Pfefferle [720] .

A previous section presented the general sooting structures of
partially-premixed  CDFs;  a  more  detailed  and  quantitative  dis-
cussion  on  the  hydrodynamic  and  chemical  effects  of  partial-
premixing  on  soot  formation  is  given  here.  It  is  helpful  to  first
show  some  direct  images  of  partially  premixed  CDFs.  Fig.  35
presents the variation of the visual flames as an incipiently-sooting
non-premixed  counterflow  flame  (equivalence  ratio φ = ∞ )  tran-
sited towards partially-premixed flames up to φ = 3 (taken by Car-
bone et al. [81] ). Note here that the stoichiometric mixture fraction
( Z st )  and  peak  temperature  were  held  constant  as  progressively
more oxygen was added to the fuel stream, in order to maintain
the location of the diffusion flame sheet and the thermal structure
unchanged on the oxidizer side. It can be seen that −apart from

the  purely  non-premixed  flame −all  the  other  partially-premixed
flames (PPF) featured double flame zones (represented by the CH
chemiluminescence, in blue) with the bottom zone being rich pre-
mixed flame and the upper zone diffusion flame. The soot zones
(yellow luminosity) were sandwiched between these two flames.
With the aid of thermocouples for temperature measurement, and
GC-MS  for  species  quantification,  Carbone  et  al.  [81]  performed
careful experimental investigations to resolve the detailed chem-
ical structures of these flames. It was shown that oxygen addition
led to a much more rapid temperature rise as the fuel stream was
convected downstream, as a result, there was more time for soot-
related reactions to occur in the high temperature regions. In fact,
increases in C
2 ), benzene, and soot concen-
4 H
trations were found as φ decreased. Further kinetic analysis also
revealed that an enhanced contribution from C
3 pathways to ben-
zene formation was induced by oxygen addition. It should be men-
tioned that the lowest level of premixing tested by Carbone et al.
[81] was already high enough ( φ = 6.5) to generate a separate rich-
premixed flame. As seen later, there are other studies in which the
level of premixing was much lower and no separate second flame
can be observed. In these cases, the mechanism of partial premix-
ing on soot formation can be different. In subsequent discussions,
these cases will be termed as small amounts of oxygen addition.

Hura and Glassman [113] are among the pioneers to measure
soot  volume  fraction  in  CDFs  with  partial premixing.  A  compre-
hensive  investigation  was  performed  to  test  the  effects  of  small
amounts of fuel side oxygen addition on soot formation in CDFs of
ethylene, propene, propane, n-butane, and iso-butane [113] . The re-
sults showed that soot volume fraction, average particle sizes, and
surface growth rates were all noticeably increased with an addi-
tion of 10% oxygen to the ethylene flame (a doubling of peak SVF);
while the enhancing effects were rather small for propene flame,
with even suppressive effect observed in propane and iso-butane
flames. The authors noticed that oxygen addition in ethylene led
to an increased amount of H radical, which helped to promote fuel
pyrolysis rate. However, no details were reported regarding impor-
tant soot precursors. Realizing that fuel side oxygen addition may
increase flame temperature, and thus thermally affect soot forma-
tion, Hura and Glassman, in a subsequent study [721] , manipulated
the oxidizer composition of the CDF to keep the peak flame tem-
perature unchanged. They also extended the range of oxygen addi-
tion from an equivalence ratio of infinity (purely diffusion flame)
to 3.0 and 2.6 for ethylene and propane flames, respectively. Ma-
jor results of this study are re-plotted in Fig. 36 in terms of the
variation of peak extinction coefficient (i.e., an indication of SVF)
with  equivalence  ratio.  Similar  soot  enhancing/inhibiting  effects
were observed for small amounts of oxygen addition (large equiv-
alence ratio, to avoid significant variations in flame structures) in
ethylene (propane) flames. With further addition of oxygen, both
flames exhibited a sharp increase, followed by a rapid decrease in
soot formation, attributable to the drastic change of flame struc-
tures. While enhanced fuel pyrolysis rates explained the initial soot
increase in ethylene, fuel dilution was believed to be the dominant
factor in decreasing soot production in propane CDF.

fusion flames showed the opposite to be true. It was postulated
by McEnally and Pfefferle [713] that 1,3-butadiene may isomerize

Partial-premixing is also interesting for methane flames, since
natural gas appliances typically rely on partially-premixed flames.
Mungekar  and  Atreya  [561,562]  studied  the  effects  of  partial-
premixing on soot formation in low strain rate methane CDFs, for
both the SF and SFO configurations. For SF flames, the authors ob-
served that with increasingly higher levels of oxygen addition, the
soot zone thickness first decreased (from φ = ∞ to 8.3) and then
increased (from φ = 8.3 to 6.4). While the initial decrease (consis-
tent with the observations of Nakamura et al. [731] in a methane
CDF  with  φ decreasing  from  infinity  to  10)  was  thought  to  be
caused by the shrinkage of the distance between the non-premixed
flame  front  and  the  stagnation  plane,  it  was  presumed  that  the
subsequent increase was due to the presence of a separate high-
temperature rich premixed flame front, on the fuel side of the non-
premixed flame front, where soot began to form. Peak SVFs were
observed to decrease as φ decreased from infinity to 8.3; this was
explained based on the dilution and chemical suppressive role of
O
2 , which was also shown to contribute to the soot reduction in
methane coflow diffusion flames with partial-premixing [714,732] .
As φ further decreased, the high temperature non-premixed flame
front moved closer to the stagnation plane, leading to increased
temperature and longer soot residence time in high temperature
regions, and resulting in an increase in SVF. In SFO flames, where
the flame is located on the fuel side of the stagnation plane, fuel
stream partial premixing was seen to monotonically decrease soot
formation; while it was noted that such a decrease was consistent
with the competition between soot inception, growth and oxida-
tion, no detailed explanations were provided.

Although  without  soot  measurements,  Berta  et  al.  per-
formed  temperature  and  intermediate  species  measurements  for
pre-vaporized  n-heptane  non-premixed  flames  [592]  and  PPFs

The  fact  that  small  amounts  of  oxygen  chemically  enhance
ethylene  sooting  tendency  was  confirmed  by  a  number  of  other
investigations  in  CDFs  [165,564]  and  coflow  diffusion  flames
[564,705,714,722–727] . The influence of oxygen in propane flames,
on  the  contrary,  has  been  the  subject  of  much  debate,  and  dis-
agreement appeared at two levels. First, contradictory results were
reported  in  different  studies  regarding  the  overall  effect  of  fuel
side  oxygen  addition  on  soot  formation.  For  instance,  Du  et  al.
[564]  showed  that  the  critical  strain  rate  K cr  (i.e.,  sooting  ten-
dency) of propane CDF increased monotonically with the level of
oxygen addition, up to 50%, while Hura and Glassman [113] ob-
served a decrease in peak SVF when 10% oxygen was added. Simi-
larly, in coflow diffusion flames of propane, increased soot produc-
tions were seen in [564,725,728] , but reduced soot formation was
observed in [721,722,724] with a small amount of oxygen addition.
No definite explanation was found to explain these discrepancies.
The second level of disagreement concerned the chemical effects
of oxygen addition. Even though the phenomenon of soot reduc-
tion observed by Hura and Glassman [721] was qualitatively con-
sistent with the experimental results of Gülder [714] , explanations
for the reduction differed. Specifically, through reactant preheating
to maintain adiabatic flame temperature and comparison against
2 -diluted flames, Gülder experimentally separated the chemi-
the N
cal effects of oxygen addition from thermal and dilution effects. His
results showed that oxygen significantly enhanced soot formation
through its chemical interactions [714] . However, Hura and Glass-
man [721] concluded that oxygen was mainly a fuel diluent, with
insignificant chemical effects, and Du et al. [564] showed a signif-
icantly suppressive role for oxygen in propane flame. Note that al-
though the work of Hwang and Chung [165] showed a reduction of
SVF in propane CDFs with oxygen addition, in their study the ox-
idizer that comprised both oxygen and nitrogen was added to the
fuel stream (to maintain temperature), so that the observed soot
reduction was a combined effect of chemical and dilution, and it
was unclear whether or not soot formation would be suppressed
if allowance was made for the dilution effects. It appears that ad-
ditional experiments −especially those accompanied by detailed ki-
netic simulation −are required to clarify this matter.

Based  on  a  detailed  gas-phase  kinetic  simulation  [165] ,  the
enhancement  of  soot  formation  by  oxygen  addition  in  ethy-
lene  CDFs  was  explained  through  the  increased  reaction  rates

Atreya [561] partially-premixed the fuel with pure oxygen, Berta
et al. [563] added air in the fuel stream so that a large amount of
2 was present in the fuel stream with partial-premixing. In these
N
cases, significant fuel dilution may have been the dominant con-
tributor to the observed soot reduction.

[733–735] ,  primarily  due  to  their  ability  to  scavenge  the  highly
reactive  H  radicals  in  hydrocarbon  flames  [736] .  There  were
also  concerns  about  environmental  pollution  and  the  problems
of  incineration-based  disposal  of  hazardous  wastes  [737] ,  of
which chlorinated species (as in chemical solvents, polychlorinated

able fraction.

Many investigations in shock tubes [738] and premixed flames
[739,740] , as well as diffusion flames [741] , have shown that chlo-
rinated compounds can enhance PAH/soot formation, as compared
to their hydrocarbon counterparts. For instance, a systematic work
of  Senkan  et  al.  [739]  showed  that  the  critical  equivalence  ra-
tio  ( φcr )  for  soot  formation  decreased  in  a  methane-based  pre-
mixed  flame  with  the  addition  of  CH
4 ,  and
the effects were stronger for molecules containing more chlorine
atoms. A critical review of relevant studies until the early 1990s
was  provided  by  Morse  and  Cundy  [742] .  Subsequent  works  in-
cluded the development of detailed kinetic models to understand
fundamental  combustion  characteristics  of  chlorinated  hydrocar-
bons (CHC) [420,743–745] . Several possible reasons were provided
to explain the higher sooting tendencies of CHCs: First, as the C-Cl
bond is noticeably weaker than C-H bond [746] , initial fuel pyrol-
ysis  is  easier  for  CHCs,  which  can  lead  to  higher  concentrations
of  the  radicals  essential  for  PAH/soot  growth  [737,738,740] ;  Sec-
ond, the chlorine atom enhances H-abstraction reaction from sta-
i - + HCl,  leading  to  more
ble  PAH  molecules  through  A
aromatic radicals for further HACA  growth  [737] ; Third, chlorine
may also scavenge oxidative radicals like O and OH, resulting in
reduced soot oxidation [740] , although such effects are not present
in oxygen-free pyrolysis experiments.

was qualitatively consistent with that of Yang and Kennedy [569] .
An interesting phenomenon was observed for C
3 Cl mixture
in that K cr  first increased and then decreased, exhibiting a non-
monotonic variation trend with CH
3 Cl mixing ratio. The author be-
lieved this was caused by chemical interactions between the mix-
ture components, i.e., the initial increase can be attributed to the
effect of chlorine on the fuel pyrolysis rates, while the latter de-
crease was due to the lowered ethylene concentration. However,
it is important to point out that in order for the author to main-
tain the carbon density (in g/cm 3 ) constant in the fuel stream, the
N
3 Cl
2 dilution (mole fraction) was higher in cases with lower CH
mixing ratio, so that the different dilution levels may also play a
role.

tended to move closer to the fuel nozzle, consistent with the work
of Mungekar and Atreya [561,562] , and much as expected, consid-
ering the variations in stoichiometric requirements. The rich pre-
mixed flame zone (indicated by the bump in the velocity profile
on the fuel side of the diffusion flame) was also seen to move to
the fuel nozzle as φ decreased, which can be rationalized by con-
sidering the balance between the stretched laminar flame speed
and the incoming reactant velocity. As φ decreased from infinity,
the  flame  speed  of  the  pre-mixture  increased  so  that  the  flame
front moved to a location at a higher reactant speed, i.e., closer to
the fuel nozzle. The stagnation plane, on the contrary, moved away
from the fuel nozzle as φ decreased. An increased level of partial-

with the observations of Mungekar and Atreya [561] in methane

5.2.4.2. addition  of  metal-containing  compounds.  Investigations  on
combustion  of  hydrocarbon  fuels  doped  with  metal-containing
compounds are generally related to the following topics: (1) flame
inhibition  [747–749] ;  (2)  synthesis  of  metal  oxide  nanoparticles
[750–752]  and desired carbon nanostructures (i.e.,  carbon nan-
otubes) [753–755] ; (3) PM/soot emission reduction [118,756–759] .
Here we are concerned only with soot, and it was found that iron-
containing  compounds  such  as  ferrocene  and  iron-pentacarbonyl
are studied most.

Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the effects
of metal additives on soot formation: First, some metals, such as
sodium and potassium, can easily become ionized in flame envi-
ronments. Their charges can subsequently be transferred to soot
precursors so that the rates of soot nucleation are effectively re-
duced [118] . Although more evidence is needed, this mechanism is
known to be consistent with observations of rich premixed ethy-
lene flames where potassium chloride (KCl) doping decreased both
the soot volume fraction and the particle size [756,760] ; Second,
metal  containing  compounds  can  scavenge  the  active  radicals  of
H, O and OH, affecting the fuel pyrolysis processes [748] , through
which  PAH/soot  formation  can,  in  turn,  be  influenced;  Third,
metal-containing compounds—especially iron-containing species—
can  decompose  to  form  metal  nanoparticles  which  serve  as  the
nuclei  to  provide  additional  surface  sites  for  soot  growth  [761] ;
Fourth, metal-containing species, when incorporated in soot par-
ticles,  can  notably  catalyze  soot  oxidation  [263] .  Note  that  the
third and fourth mechanisms contribute in opposite ways to the
final soot emission, while both are concretely supported by data
in the literature. For instance, shock tube studies showed that soot
yields for C
2 /Ar mixtures can be significantly en-
hanced  after  the  addition  of  a  small  amount  of  iron  pentacar-
5 )  [762] .  Studies  in  rich  premixed  flames,  where  a
bonyl  (Fe(CO)
deficiency of oxidizing species limits soot oxidation, have shown
enhanced  soot  formation  after  doping  of  either  ferrocene  or  Fe
(CO)
5 [761,763,764] . It was also observed that in diffusion flames,
particles appeared earlier in iron-seeded flames than in unseeded
flames [262,263,634,765] . These studies supported the third mech-
anism, as discussed above [757] . Strong evidence also exists for the
fourth mechanism, both for in-flame measurements near the oxi-
dizing flame front [263,757] , and ex-situ oxidation measurements
of  iron-containing  soot  [766] .  In  particular,  the  oxidation  activa-
tion energy for soot formed in iron-containing environments was
found to be 116 kJ/mol, significantly lower than the 162 kJ/mol for
soot formed in unseeded flames [767] . Furthermore, a recent study
suggested that the iron-containing particles that catalyze soot ox-
idation were primarily elemental Fe, rather than any form of iron
oxide [768] . It is generally accepted that soot reduction by metal
addition (observed in many practical combustion devices) is a re-
sult of more efficient burnout, rather than inhibition of soot nucle-
ation [761] .

of elemental iron over iron oxide of the diffusion flames. Neverthe-

could have contributed to molecular growth from methane to C
2
species. Perhaps the most striking observation of Raj et al. was the
presence of large amounts of O
2  in the fuel side for the seeded
methane CDF, even at locations very close to the fuel outlet [261] .
The authors explained this interesting behavior by the diffusion of
oxygen across the stagnation plane, due to early consumption of
the fuel; unfortunately, however, no oxygen concentration profiles
were provided in a subsequent modelling study [769] for further
confirmation. Raj et al. [634] continued to study the particle evo-
5 addition. With
lution of the same CDF with and without Fe (CO)
tube sampling of the flame gas and subsequent particle analysis
with a SMPS, the total particle number density and the size dis-
tributions were measured at different axial positions between the
two opposing nozzles. Major results are shown in Fig. 38 , where
it can be seen that under catalytic conditions, particles appeared
earlier near the fuel side, and the peak soot number density was
higher than in the unseeded case. However, the peak average parti-
cle diameter was smaller for the seeded flame, suggesting that the
addition of Fe (CO)
5  resulted in the formation of larger numbers
2  concentration [261] (thus
of smaller particles. The reduced C
slower HACA growth), and possibly reduced coagulation rates in
the  seeded  flame,  may  help  rationalize  such  findings.  More  in-
teresting  is  that  both  the  soot  number  density  and  average  size
in the seeded flame were seen to decrease more rapidly towards
the flame front, offering evidence for the catalytic effect of iron-

It  is  noted  that  there  are  other  dopants,  such  as  sulfur-  and

nitrogen-containing compounds (i.e., H

[119] ; however, since no relevant studies were performed in CDFs,

5.3. Effects of pressure on soot formation

Energy conversion systems such as IC engines, jet engines and
gas turbines typically rely on combustion at high pressure for max-
imum thermal efficiency and energy-releasing intensity, making it
of practical interests to study soot formation at high ∗pressure con-
ditions.  Understanding  the  dependence  of  soot  formation  kinet-
ics on pressure is also of vital importance from a scientific point
of  view.  Experimental  investigations  of  soot  formation  in  high-
pressure flames are notably more difficult than those performed
at atmospheric conditions, partly because of flame stability issues
[107] and partially due to the additional complexities of appara-
tus and instrumentation [127] . Also, the reduced flame thickness
and excessive soot formation at high-pressure conditions can cause
significant difficulties for quantitative soot measurements. Never-
theless, many researchers have successfully established steady flat
premixed flames [770] and coflow diffusion flames [20] at pres-
sures up to 100 atm.

2 H

A review of early studies on pressure effects was provided by
McArragher  and  Tan  [771] .  Subsequently,  optical  methods  such
as color pyrometry and laser light extinction/scattering were fre-
quently applied in investigations of sooting characteristics in high-
pressure  flames.  For  premixed  flames,  focus  was  on  the  vari-
ations  of  final  SVF,  soot  growth  rate,  particle  number  density
and concentrations of important gaseous intermediates with pres-
sure [770,772–777] . In particular, at a fixed equivalence ratio and
temperature,  the  final  SVF  were  seen  to  increase  with  pressure
( P )  proportional  to  P 2  up  to  several  bar  (approximately  7 bar)
[772] , beyond which a linear relationship between SVF and pres-
sure  was  observed,  indicating  the  absence  of  further  soot  mass
growth  at  those  extremely  high-pressure  conditions  [770] .  Later
numerical  calculations  confirmed  the  observed  pressure  depen-
dence [778] and the decay of soot growth was found to be caused
either by decreasing particle activity at moderate pressure (15 bar)
[774] ,  or  the  lack  of  a  growth  agent  (i.e.,  C
2 ),  at  even  higher
pressures  (70 bar)  [770] .  Similarly,  the  effect  of  pressure  on  the
radical levels, especially those of H radicals, which plays an im-
portant role in PAH and soot growth, can be notable. It was also
observed that pressure increase tended to reduce particle coagula-
tion rates, attributed to the alteration of soot surface properties in
high-pressure conditions that affect particle-particle sticking [776] .
Soot  formation  in  high-pressure  diffusion  flames  has  received
more  attention  in  the  last  decade,  justifiable  by  the  dominance
of non-premixed combustion in soot-emitting practical combustion
systems. A comprehensive review of soot studies in laminar diffu-
sion flames before 2012 was provided by Karatas and Gülder [107] ,
in which coflow flames has been investigated to the greatest ex-
tent. The advantage of coflow diffusion flames with concentric cir-
cular nozzles is that the flame heights can be maintained reason-
ably independent of pressure, provided that the fuel mass flow rate
(i.e., in mg/s) is fixed [107,779,780] . Also, at a given height above
the fuel outlet, the average velocity does not vary much with pres-
sure because the increase in flow density is balanced by the de-
crease in the flow cross-section area [483,781] . As a result, soot
volume fraction can be directly compared at the same height to
flames under different pressure conditions, providing tractability of
the pressure effects. From the review by Karatas and Gülder [107] ,
it is noted that before 2012, flames of gaseous fuels accounted for

the majority of these studies. At a constant fuel mass flow rate,
increases  in  pressure  generally  led  to  a  narrowing  of  the  flame,
resulting in increasingly curved inwards. Peak SVF, line-integrated
SVF, and maximum conversion of fuel carbon to soot, all increased
with pressure in the form [soot] ∝ P n , where n was fuel dependent
[61] and became smaller in the higher end of the pressure ranges
[483] . The increase of soot yield resulted not only from flame nar-
rowing, but from overall soot formation enhancement. Computa-
tional studies [782,783] suggested that the pressure increase re-
sults in earlier soot inception, but later oxidation, thus experienc-
ing more growth time. It was also shown [784] that high pressure
forces coflowing air to infiltrate into the fuel side near the flame
base, resulting in enhanced fuel pyrolysis.

More recently, research interest has gradually shifted towards
pre-vaporized  liquid  fuels  such  as  ethanol  [785] ,  C
6  hydrocar-
bon and oxygenated species [21] , n-heptane [486,786,787] and n-
decane  [445] .  The  effects  of  pressure  on  soot  properties  other
than SVF were also tackled, using light scattering [69] and/or ther-
mophoretic  sampling  [509] .  This  section  is  intended  to  comple-
ment the review on coflow high-pressure flames in 2012 [107] by
examining soot formation in high-pressure CDFs. In fact, Figura and
Gomez [788] showed that CDFs are largely immune to buoyancy-
driven instabilities, while this may pose significant issues for high-
pressure coflow diffusion flames, especially those with elongated
flame shapes, and thus, higher Richardson numbers. Together with
its advantages of quasi-1D structures, clean boundaries and easy
control of residence time, CDF is believed to be an ideal flame re-
actor for soot studies in high-pressure non-premixed systems. Nev-
ertheless, upper constraints in the pressure range for steady CDF
are caused by the transition towards turbulent flames, although the
use of helium as a diluent may delay such transition [788] .

The sooting limits represented by critical strain rate K cr  were
experimentally determined by Du et al. [573] for ethylene-air CDFs
in the pressure range from 1 to 2.5 atm; the results are summa-
rized in Fig. 39 . Similar to previous studies at atmospheric pres-
sure [551] , laser light scattering was used to identify critical soot-
2 with Ar in the oxi-
ing conditions; and partial substitution of N
dizer stream helped maintain the peak flame temperature as the
pressure was varied. As can be seen, K cr increased monotonically,
indicating an enhanced sooting tendency as pressure increased (a).
Also as expected, at a specified pressure, K cr  decreased with the
decrease of X
F,0 , demonstrating the effects of dilution on soot for-
mation. The authors argued that the effects of pressure would be
better represented by density-weighted critical strain rate, consid-
ering that, instead of the purely kinematic strain rate K , the char-
acteristic  reaction  rates  in  CDF  are  proportional  to  the  density-
weighted strain rate ρ
0 is the density of the oxi-
dizer at the nozzle exit). Interestingly, a linear relationship was ob-
served between ρ

that the data collected at different X

in the form of ρ

tion showed that the maximum partial pressure of C

The effects of pressure on PAH formation were investigated by

trations  were  estimated  experimentally  by  LIF  signal  intensities
(excited at 283 nm and detected at around 315 nm) and determined
computationally  by  simulations  with  detailed  chemistry.  An  ap-
proximate square dependence was observed for the peak PAH LIF
signal with the increase of pressure (LIF intensity ∼ p 2 ), consistent
with  the  calculated  maximum  PAH  concentration  (summing  up
to pyrene) and previous experimental data obtained in premixed
C
4 flames. It should be pointed out that the flames studied by
Böhm and Lacas [575] were close to the sooting limit but essen-
tially non-sooting. Note that the increase in pressure also led to
an increase in computed peak flame temperature (20 0 0 K at 1 bar,
2100 K at 3 bar and 2150 K at 6 bar). Thus, the authors commented
that the higher PAH concentration at elevated pressures was not
only an effect of pressure. It is relevant that the increase in peak
temperature with pressure was also experimentally confirmed by
Figura and Gomez [788] in methane CDFs using the technique of
SiC thin filament pyrometry [790] ; and it was shown that the in-
crease can be more than the change of adiabatic flame temperature
with pressure [636] .

ments  to  quantify  SVF  and  flow  fields,  respectively,  in  ethylene
CDFs up to 30 atm. While direct comparisons of soot loadings in
flames of different pressures were difficult because different dilu-
tion/strain rates were used as pressure varied, the authors showed
that global activation energy for nucleation increased exponentially
with pressure up to 20 atm, beyond which a sudden decrease was
observed. A correlation between the density-weighted critical soot-
ing strain rate and X 1 / 2
F, 0 P was confirmed again (with the exception
of the data point beyond 20 atm), although a methodology differ-
ent from previous studies was used to determine the critical strain
rate [85,573] .

flame conditions was based on the consideration of flame stabil-
ity, adiabaticity, pressure tractability, and sooting level. Too much
soot was undesirable as it would cause micro-probe clogging dur-
ing  the  sampling  process,  while  non-sooting  flame  would  have
rather low concentrations of PAHs, which was of special interest
to the authors. Two series of flames at incipient sooting conditions
were finally chosen for experiments, as well as numerical simu-
lations  using  a  detailed  reaction  mechanism  accounting  for  PAH
formation  [791] .  Flame  series  one  featured  a  constant  fuel  mass
F,0 )  of  0.122,  a  stoichiometric  mixture  fraction  ( Z st )  of
fraction  ( Y
0.408  and  a  global  strain  rate  of  K
,  while  the  pres-
sure  was  varied  from  1  to  8 bar.  Flame  series  two  covered  only
F,0 = 0.0975, Z st = 0.408 and
two flames at 8.55 and 25 bar, with Y
G = 18.4  s −1 .  The  reduction  of  Y
K
F  in  the  second  series  was  in-
tended to avoid excessive soot loading at the high-pressure con-
ditions (25 bar). A reduction of micro-probe outer diameter ( d out )
was shown to be necessary for probing CDF at increasingly higher
pressures, if sufficient spatial resolution was to be achieved [623] .
In fact, it was suggested that δ/ d out should be kept above 20 [623] ,
where δ is the thickness of the mixing layer, which decreases as
pressure  increases.  In  flame  series  one,  with  increased  pressure,

2  mole fraction remained comparable. The
enhancements  in  sooting  tendencies  from  increasing  pressure  in
both  flame  series  were  evidenced  by  significant  increases  in  in-
dene mole fractions at the highest pressure conditions; this was
attributed by the authors to the increases in reactant concentra-
tions with pressure [618] . Besides providing quantified concentra-
tion data to assist kinetic model developments for high-pressure
applications, an additional contribution of the work was an exten-
sive discussion on scaling and the invariance of temperature-time
history  under  different  pressure  conditions.  The  authors  demon-
strated  that  for  a  fixed  strain  rate,  the  mixing  layer  thickness δ
of the CDF was proportional to P −1/2 . After normalizing the axial
position and temperature by δ and peak temperature, respectively,
the non-dimensionalized temperature profiles for flames at differ-
ent pressures (but the same Y
G ) collapsed into a sin-
F,0 , Y
gle line. It was further shown that the temperature-time history
within the thermal layer would be invariant for flames at different
pressures, provided that these flames have a constant strain rate.
Such  invariance  provides  tractability  in  comparing  flames  oper-
ated at different pressures, otherwise, variations in residence time
would add to the pressure effects to an unknown extent [618,623] .
In a more recent study [636] , the density-weighted global strain
rates  ( ρK
G ,  were  kept  constant  for
moderately  sooting  ethylene  CDFs  ranging  1-8  atm.  SVF  profiles
were measured with LII excited at 532 nm, and detected at around
450 nm,  calibrated  against  measurements  with  light  extinction.

Nozzle exit velocities (and thus K
to  counteract  the  pressure  increase  to  maintain  a  fixed ρK
G .  As
expected,  both peak local and integrated SVF increased with in-
creased pressure. The pressure scaling factor n was derived from
the experimental data by plotting ln ( f v,max / f
v,max,0 ) as a function
0 ) and taking the slope, where the subscript 0 refers to a
of ln ( P / P

was larger in cases with constant ρK
G than in cases with constant
K
G . The authors also showed that the thickness of the soot zone
and the thermal mixing layer became invariant with pressure, as
long as ρK

[618] . Based on this fact, the authors pointed out the importance
of maintaining ρK

pressure effects. However, it may be worthwhile to point out that

Amin and Roberts [529] pioneered in-situ determination of the
morphology of soot particles in CDFs at elevated pressures. Specif-
ically,  laser  light  extinction  and  two-angle  scattering  were  used
to measure SVF, primary particle size, and number density, along
with aggregate size (average radius of gyration) and number den-
O,0 = 0.21. Note

G = 30  s −1 ,  rather  than  ρK
that  K
G  was  kept  constant.  A  special
high-pressure vessel with four curved windows was built, provid-
ing 160 ° of optical access to allow collection of scattering signals at
various angles with respect to the incident beam. The results are
summarized in Fig. 41 . Skewed profiles of SVF f v  (a) and scatter-
ing coefficient K
VV (b) can be seen, consistent with soot evolution
in SF flames. With the increase in pressure, SVF (a), primary par-
ticle size d p (c), and aggregate size R g (d) were all increased, but
the primary particle number density (c) decreased. The reduction
of soot number density was explained by enhanced coagulation ef-
ficiencies, and it is noted that a pressure increase was reported to
reduce coagulation efficiency in premixed flames [776] . Peak soot
yield was found to be scaled with pressure raised to the power of
2.67 [529] .

Carbone et al. [628] measured the mole fraction profiles of ma-
jor and critical soot related intermediate species in C
4 counter-
flow partially-premixed flames at 1, 4, and 8 atm. Three fuel side
equivalence ratios ( ∞ , 6.5 and 5.0) were tested at each pressure,
G constant for all the flames. For consistent
while keeping Z st and K
temperature-time histories for the reactants (so that the effects of
pressure could be better isolated), the peak flame temperatures at
high-pressure flames were deliberately reduced by increasing dilu-
tion. Nevertheless, the benzene mole fraction was still seen to in-
crease for partially-premixed flames with increasing pressure, de-
spite the higher dilution level. Reduced back diffusion of OH radi-
cal was thought to be a contributor to the enhanced soot precursor
formation,  aside  from  the  pressure  effects  in  increasing  reactant
concentrations [618] . Through kinetic simulations, it was observed
4  pathways  for  benzene
that  with  increasing  pressure,  the  C
3 + C
formation  became  increasingly  more  important  than  the  C
3
pathways.

More recently, Gleason et al. [490] complemented the experi-
mental database on chemical structures of high-pressure counter-
flow flames with soot volume fraction measurements. Flame con-
ditions were carefully selected to make sure that the normalized
temperature-time history was identical, regardless of pressure. The
measurement result showed that soot volume fraction increased by
two orders of magnitude as pressure increased from 1 to 4 atm
while peak flame temperature was kept unchanged. Further analy-
sis on soot growth rate also demonstrated that the activation en-
ergies for high-temperature soot growth are the same at different
pressures.

This discussion on pressure effects concludes by affirming the
great necessity for more quantified PAH and soot characterization
in high-pressure CDFs, with well-controlled conditions, especially
for practical liquid fuels and their surrogates. Both challenges and
opportunities exist for investigations on how, and to what extent
pressure-dependent  reactions  affect  soot  formation,  a  topic  that
has been largely unexplored by existing studies.

5.4. Effects of temperature on soot formation

The qualitative and quantitative dependence of soot formation
on  temperature  has  received  extensive  research  attention,  justi-
fiable  by  the  fact  that  soot  formation  is  a  highly  temperature-
sensitive  process.  Temperature  is  a  major  influence  not  only  on
the formation of soot particles, but also on their oxidation. Early
relevant investigations generally focused on the effects of temper-

ature on critical C/O ratios ((C/O) cr ), or critical equivalence ratios
( φcr ) for soot appearance in premixed flames [98,685,772,778,792–
795] ,  and  sooting  height,  or  SVF  profiles,  in  jet  diffusion  flames
[96,728,796,797] .

For  burner-stabilized  premixed  flames,  it  was  generally  ob-
served that φcr  first decreases (i.e., increase of sooting tendency)
and then increases with the progressive increase in temperature,
exhibiting an interesting non-monotonic variation [772] . At a con-
stant  C/O  ratio,  SVF  was  also  seen  to  peak  at  a  certain  temper-
ature,  and  either  an  increase  or  a  decrease  from  this  tempera-
ture  would  decrease  soot  formation  [97,772,794] .  These  findings
can be partially understood by the competing effects of temper-
ature  on  soot  precursor  formation  and  on  oxidative  destruction.
In the low end of the temperature range, an increase in temper-
ature would result in faster fuel decomposition to soot precursors
and an enhancement of the molecular growth processes towards
PAHs and soot particles. However, further increase in temperature
would result in a faster increase in the oxidation rates of soot pre-
cursors/particles than in the rates for their formation [796] . Also,
reduced surface reactivity [597] and decreased thermodynamic sta-
bility of soot precursors [141] can play important roles in reducing
soot formation at high temperatures.

For

jet  diffusion  flames,  Glassman

coworkers
[96,796]  showed  that  sooting  height  decreases  with  the  in-
crease in adiabatic flame temperature, demonstrating a qualitative
trend  in  these  flames  that  increases  in  temperature  lead  to  an
enhancement of the sooting tendency. Note that the adjustment of

and

tion (N
through both flame temperature and concentration modifications.
Nevertheless, the authors proved that the effect of temperature is
dominant and fuel dilution plays only a secondary role. Although
this conclusion seems to be consistent with the sooting limit curve
obtained for SF CDFs (e.g., Fig. 26 , with relatively large X
F ) where
temperature dominates the critical condition of soot formation, in
other cases it was reported that dilution can have important and
even greater effect than temperature [95,700] .

In diffusion flames, soot inception and growth occur on the fuel
side of the flame, where the concentration of oxidizing species is
rather low. Without the competing effect of oxidation, an increase
in flame temperature is expected to enhance the rates of soot pre-
cursor formation, as well as those of particle inception and surface
growth, leading to a monotonic increase of sooting tendency. Note
that for over-ventilated coflow diffusion flames, oxidation occurs
later in the post-flame zone as heterogenous reactions, which will
notably affect ultimate soot emission, but not the critical sooting
condition [796] . Also note that fuel pyrolysis in diffusion flames is
not the same as in a shock tube, where it was shown that soot
yields have non-monotonic variation with temperature [798] . In a
shock  tube,  pyrolysis  occurs  at  uniform  temperature,  and  if  this
temperature is too high, the thermodynamic stability of soot pre-
cursors  decreases,  and  soot  production  is  reduced  [141,798] .  On
the  other  hand,  there  is  always  a  spatial  profile  of  temperature
in diffusion flames, extending from boundary temperatures in the
fuel/oxidizer inlets all the way to peak flame temperature. Fuel py-
rolysis and soot inception can always be efficient locally at a loca-

tion with intermediate temperatures. As a result, the sooting ten-
dency in diffusion flames generally increases monotonically with
temperature. Beltrame et al. [576] showed that in a soot forma-
tion CDF with undiluted methane as the fuel stream, peak SVF in-
O,0  increased from 21% all the way to
creased monotonically as X
100% (although it should be noted that increases of X
O,0 reduce di-
lution as well as increasing temperature).

In fact, the variation of temperature of diffusion flames was fre-
quently achieved by adjusting the amount and type of diluents in
both fuel and oxidizer streams, so that the effects of dilution were
likely to interfere with the effects of temperature. Therefore, dilu-
tion effects must be isolated if a quantitative correlation between
soot formation and temperature is to be obtained. In this regard,
Axelbaum et al. [74] adjusted the flame temperature of CDFs by the
substitution of volume flow rate of N
2 in the oxidizer stream and
an equal volume flow rate of Ar. Since Ar has a lower heat capac-
ity than N
2 , its substitution resulted in an increase in peak flame
temperature. Since the mole fraction of the inert diluent was not
affected,  temperature  could  be  varied  without  affecting  dilution
level. Using such an approach, the effects of dilution and temper-
ature can be separated. In practice, flames with different levels of
fuel stream dilution can be compared at a fixed peak temperature;
and flames with different peak temperatures can also be compared
at constant X
F,0 . Results from these types of studies were
discussed in a previous section on inert dilution and will not be
repeated here.

O,0 and X

A well-controlled peak temperature does not necessarily mean
a controlled spatial temperature profile [74] , and the latter may be
of importance for the sooting process in SF CDFs, where the parti-
cle growth region is spatially separated from the peak flame tem-
perature region. Ideally, the effects of temperature on soot forma-
tion should be studied with a well-controlled, well-characterized
temperature-time  history  (i.e.,  not  only  the  peak  temperature)
which the soot particles may experience. Towards this goal, Car-
bone  et  al.  [628]  demonstrated  the  importance  of  keeping  the
stoichiometric  mixture  fraction  ( Z st )  and  the  global  strain  rate
G ) constant when perturbing peak flame temperatures. By doing
( K
this, the position of the flame front relative to the gas stagnation
plane −as well as the flame thickness −can be kept constant so that
after normalizing the temperature with respect to its peak value,
the normalized temperature-convective time history remains simi-
lar among flames with different peak temperatures. In other words,
the  temperature-time  profiles  become  self-similar,  so  the  effects
of peak temperature could be effectively isolated [4 89,4 90] . Note,
in order to achieve peak temperature variation while keeping Z st
constant, the dilution levels in both the fuel and oxidizer streams
must  be  altered,  although  this  additional  complexity  caused  by
the variations of dilution level may be insignificant if the required
temperature range is moderate. In particular, Gomez and cowork-
ers [489] showed that in order for the peak temperature of ethy-
lene CDF to vary from 1890 to 2186 K (variation of around 300 K),
the fuel mass fraction must increase from 0.30 to 0.39, while the
oxygen mass fraction in the oxidizer stream must increase from
0.23 to 0.30. The measured axial profiles of temperature, SVF and
soot production rate for this series of ethylene CDFs are shown in
Fig. 42 .

As  can  be  seen  in  Fig.  42 (a)  and  (b),  although  the  tempera-
ture  profiles  are  self-similar,  the  shape  of  the  SVF  profiles  vary
among the different peak temperature cases. In these flames, the
SVF  begins  to  increase  in  a  region  close  to  the  flame  front  and
then continues to grow as they are convected towards the particle
stagnation plane, exhibiting common features for SF flames. How-
ever, the rates of soot growth vary notably among the flames. As
shown clearly in Fig. 42 (c), for cases with lower peak temperature,
the initial growth rates are also lower. Since this initial growth oc-
curs in a high temperature region ( Z ∼ 0.5 mm), where HACA sur-

face reactions are expected to be efficient, their decreasing rates,
with decreasing peak temperatures, are consistent with the high
activation energy characteristics of the HACA reaction scheme. As
particles are transported towards the  stagnation plane, excessive
temperature reduction causes the soot growth rates to fall quickly
to  nearly  vanishing  values.  A  somewhat  unexpected  observation
was  a  sharp  increase  in  soot  growth  rates  in  regions  very  close
to the stagnation plane, where the temperature was below 1600 K.
The authors suggested a possible ion-induced nucleation mecha-
nism to explain this. Although this seems to be qualitatively con-
sistent with the modelling results of Wang et al. [140] , where nu-
cleation reaction and physical addition of PAH were seen to con-
tribute to soot growth in the proximity of the particle stagnation
plane, the comparable peak level of this low-temperature growth
rate  with  that  of  the  high-temperature  HACA  rate  was  not  pre-

dicted by Wang et al. More studies, involving both numerical and
experimental efforts, are needed to shed light on the mechanisms
of this interesting low-temperature soot growth. It is also impor-
tant to point out that Sirignano et al. [89] also found evidence of
low temperature soot growth and demonstrated that soot particles
can also exist in the fuel side of the particle stagnation plane.

5.5. Effects of strain rate on soot formation

In Section 4.3 , we discussed how strain rate may influence the
overall sooting structure of CDFs. Here we intend to complement
that discussion with a more comprehensive review on strain rate
effects on PAH and soot formation. Because PAH/soot formation is a
kinetically-driven rate-limiting process, quantitative investigations
on the correlation between sooting characteristics and strain rate
in CDFs can help explain the kinetics of soot formation.

A second motivation for studying strain rate effects is the link
between diffusion flamelet and turbulent flame, the latter is some-
what  difficult  to  model  due  to  the  large  variations  of  temporal
and spatial scales involved. The task becomes even more challeng-
ing when soot formation chemistry is considered, which by itself
includes  a  large  number  of  reactions,  spanning  a  wide  range  of
reaction time scales. The flamelet model, as pioneered by Peters
[106] , provides a tractable approach for simulating turbulent diffu-
sion flames with complex chemistry. In such a model, local struc-
tures of the turbulent reaction zones are approximated by strained
flamelets, which are to be convected and stretched by the turbu-
lent flow fields. A key parameter characterizing diffusion flamelets
is scalar dissipation rate ( χ ), closely related to, and with the same
unit  (reciprocal  of  time)  of  strain  rate.  In  fact,  the  structures  of
steady  flamelets  can  be  solved  entirely  in  the  mixture  fraction
space once χ is specified [799] . In this context, a CDF is an appro-
priate model because of its relevance to many physics postulated
for diffusion flamelets. The strain rate of CDF can be linked to χ of
diffusion flamelet in a straightforward way. Besides, effort s needed
to systematically vary the strain rate of CDF are minimal as it can
be achieved by simply adjusting the nozzle exit velocities. This is
in contrast to coflow flames, in which the strain rate is difficult to
control and usually too small to be a representative of turbulent
flames [114] .

It is important to highlight here that due to the slow kinetics
involved in PAH/soot formation, sooting process in highly transient
flames can have significant unsteady effects. The above-mentioned
(steady) flamelet approximation is not able to predict the forma-
tion of soot, although it may be used with success in predicting the
overall local structure of turbulent flames (i.e., major flame prod-
ucts). As a result, it is of practical interests to investigate soot for-
mation under unsteady strain rate conditions. Section 5.5.2 is ded-
icated to this matter.

5.5.1. Strain rate effects on sooting behaviors in steady CDFs

A number of studies have investigated how strain rate affects
PAH formation, both experimentally [91,114,585] and computation-
ally [91,92,114,800] . The experimental techniques that were used
to evaluate PAH concentrations were either gas chromatography or
LIF; while chromatography can provide quantified mole fractions
of individual PAH species, LIF can only provide fluorescence inten-
sities that qualitatively represent a class of PAHs in a certain size
range. These studies generally demonstrated that as the strain rate
increases, peak flame temperature, C
3 decrease mod-
erately, and the mole fractions of aromatic species decrease more
significantly. In addition, PAH species with larger molecular sizes
are more sensitive to strain rate. An example is shown in Fig. 43
O,0 = 0.25 [91] , where both nu-

fractions of which exhibited a decrease of one and two orders of
magnitude, respectively.

The  effects  of  strain  rate  on  flame  and  PAH  chemistries  re-
sult from several mechanisms. First, the flame intensity (and thus
peak  flame  temperature)  are  expected  to  decrease  with  the  in-
creased strain rate, primarily because of the reduced Damköhler
number. Since the temperature-dependent fuel pyrolysis process is
essential  in  diffusion  flames  to  produce  small  molecular  precur-
sors (i.e., C
3 , etc.) for PAH growth, decreased tem-
perature  would  lead  to  lower  PAH  formation  rate;  Second,  even
with abundant small molecular precursors, the growth of PAH is
a slow rate-limiting process and would be significantly inhibited
by decreased residence time. Since larger PAHs grow sequentially
from smaller ones, this also explains why larger PAHs are progres-
sively more sensitive to strain rate; Third, the general scaling ar-
gument [81] shows that the increase in strain rate would reduce
the characteristic thickness of the flame, resulting in the originally-
separated pyrolysis zone and high temperature OH-oxidizing zone
being  pushed  closer  together.  As  a  result,  concentrations  of  oxi-
dizing species in the fuel pyrolysis zone tend to increase, causing
increased fuel oxidation to form sequentially CH
2 O, CHO and CO.
Note,  however,  this  last  mechanism is  expected  to  be  important
only at very high strain rates (i.e., close to extinction) [114] .

The first quantitative measurement of the variation of SVF with
strain  rate  was  conducted  in  CDFs  stabilized  around  a  cylindri-
cal porous burner using laser light extinction and scattering [554] .
Similar experimental studies were later performed in counterflow
burners with opposing screened, or contoured, nozzles [78,91,576] .
Much as expected, these studies generally showed that the peak
SVF exhibited a monotonic decrease as the strain rate increased, as
has already been discussed in Section 4.3 .

It is logical to expect that fuels with distinct molecular struc-
tures will have different sooting rates when burned under similar

veloped to quantify the dependence of sooting tendency of a par-
ticular fuel to strain rate variations.

In addition to global soot loading, as characterized by SVF, the
effects of strain rate on the details of particle size distribution were
also  investigated.  Numerical  simulation  with  a  sectional  method
[92] showed that in both benzene and ethylene SF CDFs, the per-
centage contribution of the number of small particles ( ∼ 1.7 nm)
to the total soot number density was only marginally affected, but
those  of  larger  particles  decreased  notably  with  the  increase  in
strain rates.

5.5.2. Soot formation in CDFs subject to unsteady strain rates

The  preceding  discussions  focused  on  sooting  behaviors  at
steady conditions. For application in turbulent combustion mod-
elling through the flamelet approach, unsteady effects are also im-
portant [802] . In a turbulent environment, the mean strain rate of
flamelets  is  established  from  the  larger-scale  eddies,  while  fluc-
tuations around the mean values and associated unsteady effects
can  be  caused  by  smaller  eddies,  with  turnover  time  compara-
ble  to  the  diffusion  time  scale  of  the  flamelets  [803–805] .  CDF
is  an  ideal  flame  configuration  to  study  unsteady  strain  rate  ef-
fects because the unsteadiness can be established experimentally
by imposing oscillation on the nozzle exit velocity. Numerically, the
quasi-one dimensionality makes time-resolved simulation with de-
tailed chemistry much more efficient.

Before addressing soot formation in unsteady CDFs, a general
understanding of global flame responses to oscillating strain rates
is  helpful.  Relevant  studies  on  the  dynamics  of  unsteady  CDFs
[804,806–812]  showed  that  for  small  oscillation  frequencies  of
nozzle exit velocity (i.e., strain rate), the flame responds to the os-
cillations in a quasi-steady manner (characterized by heat release
rates, temperature, or OH concentration profiles). As the oscillation
frequency increases, some transient behavior (e.g., phase lag, re-
duced response) begin to develop. With further increase in oscilla-
tion frequency, the flame may fail to respond altogether. The cutoff
frequency  that  differentiates  between  quasi-steady  and  transient
responses  was  also  observed  to  increase  in  cases  with  stronger
burning  [808] .  An  example  of  the  variation  of  maximum  flame
temperature  with  oscillation  frequency  can  be  seen  in  Fig.  45 .
Through a time-resolved simulation with detailed chemistry, Egol-
fopoulos and Campbell [805] provided a physical interpretation of
the above observations: On either side of the reaction zone in a
CDF, there is a hydrodynamic zone, followed by a diffusion zone
in  which  diffusion  is  the  dominant  mechanism  for  transporting
fuel/oxidizer toward −and heat away from −the reaction zone. Al-
though  the  effects  of  oscillation  in  the  nozzle  exit  velocity  can
be propagated nearly unaltered through the hydrodynamic zone,
the oscillation can only be sensed indirectly by the flame through
the effects that far-field disturbances induce on the diffusion pro-
cesses.  It  was  further  shown  that  the  exit  velocity  oscillation  in
CDF creates an oscillation of mass fraction of the reactants. In this
regard, mass diffusion of the reactants towards the reaction zone is
the dominant mechanism controlling the flame response to oscil-
lating boundary conditions. The authors proposed an analogy be-
tween the unsteady CDF and the Stokes second problem, in which
the fluctuating velocities induced by an oscillating plate in an ini-
tially stagnant flow (through momentum diffusion) become atten-
uated with the increase in the distance away from the plate ( z ) and
the oscillation frequency ( ω). The amplitude of velocity fluctuation
in  Stokes  second  problem  is  controlled  by  the  non-dimensional
Stokes parameter ηz = z ( ω/2 ν), where ν is the fluid kinematic vis-
cosity. Similarly, it was shown that the amplitude of peak temper-
ature fluctuation in unsteady CDFs is controlled by η
K = δ( ω/2 D ) 1/2
≈( ω/2 K
G ) 1/2 , where the latter approximation is supported by the
dependence  of  the  diffusion  zone  thickness  δ on  the  diffusivity
D , and the global strain rate as δ≈( D / K
G ) 1/2 . The flame response

conditions. For instance, it is widely accepted that benzene forma-
tion  is  a  critical  step,  for  being  rate-limiting,  toward  the  forma-
tion of soot in flames of small aliphatic fuels. On the other hand,
the situation is obviously different for fuels that already contain
aromatic  rings  (benzene formation can  be  bypassed). Similar ar-
guments can be applied even to different fuels belonging to the
same class, considering that different fuel molecules lead to py-
rolysis/oxidative intermediate species that contribute to soot pre-
cursor formation through different channels and at different rates.
Variations in the sooting rate of different flames are expected to
lead to variations in the sensitivity of the final soot concentrations
to  strain  rate.  Decroix  and  Roberts  [801]  found  the  rates  of  de-
crease in peak SVF to be higher for C

experimental results were obtained by Wang and Chung [91] , with

pendence of peak SVF to strain rate can be fitted into a power law
relation: f v,max ( K

global strain rate and the subscript a is the exponent, with higher
values indicating higher sensitivity of SVF to strain rate. The value
of a was found to be fuel-dependent, and it was 0.88 for benzene

methane flames, respectively [92] .

A more interesting observation [91] is that, although the sen-
sitivity  of  soot  loadings  to  strain  rate  depend  on  fuel  type  at  a
O,0 ),  once  the  peak  SVF  is  adjusted
fixed  flame  condition  ( X
(for instance, by varying X
O,0 ) to be similar among these different
fuels at a given reference strain rate, the sensitivity of peak SVF
to strain rate becomes reasonably independent of fuel type. This
point is clarified in Fig. 44 , where the correlation between peak
SVFs and their slope of decrease with strain rate (represented by
nozzle exit velocity V
0 in the figure) are shown. Although the data
were collected for various fuels, they fall on the same line, demon-
strating that the peak SVF at a reference strain rate ( not fuel type)
dominates the strain rate sensitivity. This interesting result seems
to indicate an inherent similarity in the soot formation processes
among different fuels. It should be remembered, however, that this
conclusion  is  only  drawn  from  the  four  aliphatic  fuels  tested  in
Fig.  44 ,  and  further  investigations are  necessary to  test  whether
it can be generalized to other fuels. It is also noted that this result
is consistent with the sooting sensitivity index (SSI) data [620] , de-

mean  value.  Experiments  were  done  at  four  initial  K
G  ranging
from 15 to 90 s −1 , with unsteady forcing at frequencies from 25
to 200 Hz, and at both low and high amplitudes. Results showed
that maximum soot SVF (global maximum in terms of both tem-
poral  and  spatial  variation)  for  the  unsteady  flames  was  gener-
ally higher than their steady counterparts, this enhancement was
seen to be most prominent in cases of low forcing frequency and
high  amplitude.  The  SVF  responses  were  much  attenuated  with
high-frequency oscillations. For example, an increase by a factor of
3.4 in peak SVF was observed for propane CDF oscillated at 25 Hz
G of 60 s −1 while soot production became nearly
around a mean K
insensitive for oscillation frequencies larger than 100 Hz. Further-
more, significant phase lag between the peak SVF peaks and strain
rate troughs were noticed.

Because PAHs are the precursors of soot, their behavior in un-
steady flames is particularly important for a better understanding
of soot formation. For this reason, planar LIF was used to detect
spatially- and temporally-resolved PAH concentrations for unsteady
CDFs [585] . The LIF signals were detected at different wavelengths
to represent PAHs of different size classes, with lower wavelengths
corresponding  to  smaller  PAHs.  As  expected,  the  results  showed
that PAH concentrations only responded to low frequency oscilla-
tion, becoming insensitive to oscillations beyond a critical value,
which depends on PAH sizes and several other flame conditions
like fuel type and mean strain rate. For larger PAHs, this critical
frequency was lower, which was reasonable since the formation of
larger PAHs requires the presence of smaller ones. However, an un-
expected finding was that the critical frequency was smaller for
flames with a higher mean strain rate. For example, with an ini-
L ) increasing from 23 to 44, and then to 74 s −1 ,
tial strain rate ( K
the critical frequency for large PAH responses decreased from 200
to  50,  and  then  to  30 Hz.  This  is  in  sharp  contrast  to  the  scal-
ing laws proposed by Egolfopoulos and Campbell [805] in which

of the flame responses (i.e., flame temperature) to the oscillating

tion (mentioned above) is that the thickness of the diffusion zone
would be reduced so that free-stream oscillation could propagate
into the reaction zone with less damping in flames with a higher
strain rate. The notable deviation between the response of the PAH
concentrations  and  this  scaling  law  for  overall  flame  properties

would decrease as η
K increased, either by increasing frequency or
reduced strain, as shown in Fig. 46 , where the flame response of
many different flames collapsed into a single line with η
K . Phys-
ically,  a  decrease  in  the  global  strain  rate  can  lead  to  increases
in diffusion thickness so that the attenuation in flame responses
are expected to be stronger. The increase in frequency would be
accompanied  by  disturbances  with  shorter  wavelength,  causing
larger  gradients  and  diffusive  fluxes −again  dampening  flame  re-
sponses.

With overall flame behaviors under unsteady conditions clearly
explained by Egolfopoulos and Campbell [805] , more recent studies
focused on how PAH and soot formation are affected by unsteadi-
ness [395,577,585,593,598,630,801] . The response of PAH/soot for-
mation to strain rate oscillations does not necessarily follow that of
the peak flame temperatures or heat release since: (1) PAHs/soot
are  typically  formed  in  the  fuel  rich  pyrolysis  zone  that  lie  in-
side  the  diffusion  zone  of  CFDs,  compared  to  the  thin  reaction
zone where most heat release occurs; (2) The chemical time scale
for  PAH/soot  formation  is  notably  larger  than  the  main  heat  re-
lease reactions; (3) large PAHs and soot particles have very small
diffusivity  compared  to  gas-phase  species.  Time-resolved  in-situ
SVF measurements in unsteady CDFs were first performed by De-
croix and Roberts [801] using LII. The oscillation in strain rate was
experimentally achieved by driving two loudspeaker diaphragms,
installed  respectively  at  the  end-faces  of  two  plenums;  through
each plenum, the fuel and oxidizer were introduced to the nozzle

(i.e., peak temperature) clearly demonstrates that diffusion-limited
responses alone are not sufficient to explain the PAH behavior ob-
served under unsteady conditions. The relatively larger time scale
for PAH formation compared to that of the main heat release reac-
tion is likely to play a role. It is noteworthy that although the au-
thors in the original publication [585] attempted to correlate PAH
with η

K , the scatter of the data was fairly clear.

Besides the critical frequency, the amplitudes, symmetries and
phase lags of the variations in PAH/soot concentrations subject to
unsteady strain rates are also important. Fig. 47 shows the peak,
trough and mean values, as well as phase lags for the PAH mole
fractions as a function of oscillating frequencies [593] . Clearly, the
phase lags are always close to zero at low frequencies, indicating
quasi-steady responses. However, the peak and trough values for
PAH/soot concentrations are not symmetric around the mean val-
ues. The asymmetry becomes more significant for larger PAHs −and
most notably for soot. More interestingly, the mean PAH/soot con-
centrations (averaged over an entire oscillating period) are higher
than the steady state value, consistent with the experimental data
of  Decroix  and  Roberts  [585] .  The  asymmetry  and  the  resulting
increase in the average PAH/soot concentrations in the unsteady
flames may be attributed to the fact that PAH/soot formations are
more sensitive to the variations in strain rate (and thus residence
time) at lower strain rate instants. This is more or less consistent
with  the  findings  in  steady  flames.  For  example,  Beltrame  et  al.
[576]  showed  that  the  peak  SVF  of  a  CH
2  CDF  decreased  by
around 50% as the strain rate increased from 20 to 40 s −1 , while a

4 -O

further increase of strain rate by 20 s −1 only resulted in a decrease
of peak SVF by 28%.

As oscillating frequency continues to increase, notable phase lag
develops  between  PAH/soot  concentrations  and  strain  rates.  The
phase  lag  was  also  seen  to  be  larger  for  species  with  a  larger
characteristic reaction time scale [395,630] . Cuoci et al. [395] ex-
plained this by referring to the diffusion zone through which free-
stream oscillations must pass to affect the reaction zone, and the
species-dependent responses were attributed to the different diffu-
sion time of each species. Following analysis by Egolfopoulos and
Campbell [805] , the authors also tried to correlate the predicted
oscillation  amplitudes  of  PAH/soot  concentrations  with  the  rele-
vant Stokes number; however, it was not possible to collapse the
responses of different species into a single line. This was expected
since only diffusion-limited responses were taken into account in
the relevant discussions based on and in the very definition of the
Stokes number, while the effects of slow PAH/soot chemistry were
excluded.  In  fact,  this  point  was  considered  by  Rodrigues  et  al.
[630] and it was shown analytically (through linearized asymptotic
analysis) that the phase lag and the reduction of response ampli-
tudes of a certain flame quantity (i.e., species concentrations) with
the  increase  in  frequency,  are  directly  affected  by  the  Damköh-
ler number of the corresponding flame quantity. In addition, the
authors [630] also demonstrated that the steady response of any
flame  property  to  strain  rate  also  affects  its  responses  (i.e.,  am-
plitude damping) under unsteady conditions. It can be generalized
that flame responses to strain rate oscillation are primarily deter-
mined by: (1) the Stokes number, which compares the characteris-

220

tic diffusion time scale with the imposed oscillation time scale; (2)
the Damköhler number, which indicates the characteristic reaction
time scale of a certain quantify of interests; and (3) a parameter
that represents the steady response of a certain quantity of inter-
ests to strain rate variations [630] .

5.6. Various other effects

Noteworthy counterflow-based soot studies for various other ef-

fects are discussed next.

5.6.1. Soot formation in counterflow flames of fuel sprays

In  addition  to  use  in  the  study  of  flames  with  gas-phase  or
pre-vaporized fuels, counterflow burners have also been employed
in  spray  combustion  studies  [813,814] .  Spray  flame  is  a  highly
complex multi-phase phenomenon and much of its fundamental
physics are still not fully understood. As such, experimental [815–
817] and numerical [818–821] investigations of spray flames estab-
lished in a simple flow field are useful for clarifying their major
features. Previous studies have shown that droplet mean size, size
distributions, and droplet evaporation rates are important factors
that affect the general characteristics of spray flames, such as flame
temperature  and  species  concentration  distributions  [822–825] .
Depending  on  the  boundary  conditions,  both  premixed-like  and
diffusion-like flames can exist in the combustion of fuel droplets
[826] . Drop group combustion (i.e., the combustion of droplet clus-
ters) was observed to behave like diffusion flames [827–829] .

With  respect  to  soot  formation  in  spray  counterflow  flames,
Chen and Gomez [816] studied two CDFs of quasi-monodispersed
n-heptane  sprays  with  the  same  global  fuel/air  ratios.  The  first
flame  existed  as  a  thin  blue  sheet  and  was  observed  to  behave
similarly  to  that  of  a  purely  gaseous  flame,  which  was  rational-
ized by the fact that the droplets are completely evaporated be-
fore reaching the flame zone. In the second flame, however, with a
higher initial mean droplet size and velocity, some droplets sur-
vived  and  penetrated  the  first  flame  of  fuel  vapors  towards  the
oxygen-rich environment. As a result, a second flame, characterized
by a thick orange region on the oxidizer side, was formed. The au-
thors attributed this orange luminosity to radiation of small soot
particles,  although  quantification  of  soot  concentrations  was  not
performed. Nevertheless, this study indicated that an increase in
initial droplet size may enhance soot formation, a topic for which
Hayashi et al. [603] conducted detailed experimental and numer-
ical  investigations.  The  authors  established  n-decane  (n-C
22 )
spray  flame  in  a  laminar  counterflow  field,  with  a  burner  setup
and  flame  pictures  shown  in  Fig.  48  [603] .  A  vibratory  orifice
atomizer  (VOA),  installed  at  the  top  of  the  upper  (fuel)  burner,
provided  quasi-monodispersed  fuel  droplets  with  variable  mean
droplet  sizes.  The  fuel  spray  was  premixed  by  air  at  φ = 0.106
and  issued  from  the  upper  nozzle  against  stretch-stabilized lean
methane-air premixed flames, mimicking the conditions in prac-
tical  combustors  where  premixed  fuel  sprays  approach  the  high
temperature zone. A strong effect of initial droplet size on soot for-
mation was observed. As the initial Sauter mean diameter (SMD) of
the fuel droplets increased, an initially blue reaction zone transi-
tioned towards yellow flames with increasingly higher luminosity,
indicating an enhancement of both the peak soot concentrations
and  the  sooting  zone  areas  (further  confirmed  by  corresponding
LII  measurements).  In  addition,  an  interesting  local  inhibition  of
soot formation was observed for larger SMD conditions, resulting
in an annular shape for the spatial distribution of soot, with parti-
cle sizes being larger in the radially outer region of the soot zone.
This local inhibition can be attributed to the evaporative cooling
effects caused by group combustion of the unburned, initially large
fuel droplets.

10 H

Droplet size distribution can also significantly affect soot for-
mation. Experimental results showed that both the soot concentra-
tion and the sooting zone area were reduced in spray counterflow
flames for poly-dispersed droplets, as compared to quasi-mono dis-
persed droplets with the same SMD [612] . In poly-dispersed cases
there were a larger number of small fuel droplets, more likely to be
completely evaporated before reaching the high temperature flame
zone.  As  a  result,  the  premixed-like  combustion  mode  was  pro-
moted, which is helpful for soot reduction.

[831,832] , ions of PAHs [833] , and carbon clusters in the form of
2n  with 30 ≤ 2n ≤ 210 (both positive and negative) [834,835] ,
C
in  addition  to  charged  soot  particles  [133,836,837] .  It  is  there-
fore  reasonable  to  expect  the  flame  to  be  significantly  affected
when exposed to external electric fields. Indeed, it has been shown
that  electric  field-assisted  combustion  can  change  flame  shapes
[838,839] and temperatures [840] , improve flame instability [841–
843] , enhance flame propagation speeds [844–846] , and affect soot
emissions [527,566,847–850] .

Whether soot formation in a certain CDF can be inhibited de-
pends on the intensity, polarity (for DC), and frequency (for AC) of
the applied electric fields [527] . In sooting ethylene CDFs, where
the fuel nozzle is connected to the high-voltage terminal and the
oxidizer nozzle is grounded, a small positive voltage did not no-
tably affect the flame position or soot formation, but larger volt-
ages resulted in flame instability. However, applying negative volt-
age < − 2 kV reduced soot/PAH concentrations significantly in both
SF  and  SFO  flame  configurations.  The  measured  spatial  distribu-
tions of OH/PAH LIF, and soot LII signals, are shown in Fig. 49 for
both  the  SF  (a)/SFO  (b)  baseline  flames  and  those  with  a  nega-
tive voltage of −2.0 kV applied (c, d). The locations of the OH LIF
zones were seen to be dragged towards the fuel side by the electric
field, consistent with the direction of ionic wind [851,852] , since
there are more positive ions than negative. Similarly, the stagna-
tion plane was also forced closer to the fuel side. Since soot is al-
ways formed on the fuel side of the flame, these movements of
the flame front and stagnation plane are expected to result in a
narrower fuel pyrolysis zone and less residence time for PAH/soot
growth. Furthermore, heat loss toward the burner nozzle may also
be enhanced, leading to lower flame temperature and reduced soot
formation rates. Note that these explanations are based solely on
the effects of ionic wind. Although reasonable, they do not explain
the flame instability when positive potential is applied, or the fact
that in certain flames [850] luminosity was always seen to shift
away from the fuel nozzle, independent of the polarity of the DC
potential.

2 H

Kono  and  coworkers  [850]  applied  AC  potentials  in  sooting
2  CDFs. At an AC frequency of 327 kHz, the authors observed
C
that SVF profiles shifted away from the fuel nozzle and peak SVF
increased  when  the  peak-to-peak  voltage  was  4.8 kV,  while  the
opposite  was  true  when  it  was  1.6 kV.  These  complex  behaviors
were thought to result from forces other than the ionic wind ef-
fects. Clearly, more mechanistic investigations are required to ex-
plain these experimental observations.

5.6.3. Effects of soot radiation on flame characteristics

CDF is a classic tool for investigating critical strain rate in dif-
fusion flame extinction [109,853] , which are routinely used as an
important global flame property for the validation of detailed ki-
netic mechanisms (see e.g., Refs. [587,854–856] ). CDF can be extin-
guished at both high and low strain rates [857–860] . Available time
for mixing is short at sufficiently high strain rates, and the flame
is extinguished due to insufficient fuel/oxidizer mixing. At very low

Fig. 50.  Effects of soot loading on extinction strain rate in counterflow diffusion
flames, numerical data taken from Narayanan et al. [604] . For non-adiabatic flame,
extinction can be seen to occur at both high and low strain rates due to an ex-
cessively small Damköhler number; and the presence of soot particles noticeably
affects the lower critical strain rate for extinction.

strain rates, flame intensity is low and relative heat loss due to ra-
diation becomes critically important, which can notably decrease
flame temperature (increase reaction time) and finally, extinguish
the flame.

Heat loss due to radiation from soot particles can be significant,
especially when considering the multi-dimensional effect in prac-
tical flames where soot produced in fuel-rich regions can be trans-
ported (by convection and/or turbulence) to the high-temperature
reaction  zone  to  exert  influence  on  flammability.  To  analyze  the
effects of radiation heat loss from this non-local soot on the flame
extinction limit, an analytical study, using large activation energy
asymptotic theory, was performed for C
4  CDF, with pre-loaded
soot particles in the oxidizer stream [604] . The results, shown in
Fig. 50 , demonstrate that the presence of soot had a strong effect
in reducing the size of the flammable domain. Particularly, with
an initial soot mass fraction of 5%, the lower strain rate radiation-
extinction limit would be increased by more than one magnitude,
and the upper mixing-limited extinction strain rate could be de-
creased by around 30%.

2 H

In  vigorously  burning  CDFs,  the  presence  of  flame-generated
soot particles also tends to reduce soot formation as a result of
radiative cooling of the flame [583,613,627,861] . The extent of such
reduction is higher in flames with a lower strain rate [627] . Never-
theless, in typical SF flames, the effect of soot radiation was found
to be weaker than that of gas radiation [583] . This is because in
SF  flames,  SVF  peaks  at  the  stagnation  plane,  which  is  spatially
separated from the high-temperature reaction zone and thus has
a relatively low temperature of around 10 0 0 K. On the other hand,
the  most  effective  gaseous  radiators  such  as  CO
2 O  peak
near the reaction zone with much higher local temperature. For
the same reason, soot radiation in SF flames may be less impor-
tant than in coflow flames, where SVF peaks in regions of relatively
higher temperatures.

5.6.4. Interactions between soot and nitric oxides

The  formation  of  nitrogen  oxides  (NOx)  in  hydrocarbon-air
flames is known to be temperature sensitive and can therefore be
influenced  by  radiative  heat  loss  from  gaseous  species  and  soot
particles, if present [862,863] . In addition, oxidation of soot par-
ticles and precursors may compete with thermal NOx formation
for O and OH radicals, contributing to the reduction of NOx emis-
2 ), as a form of
sion [539] . On the other hand, nitric dioxide (NO

al. [864] .

NOx, is a strong soot oxidizing agent −even more effective than O
2
[327,330] . In this regard, soot and NOx −being the two most wor-
rying pollutants from hydrocarbon fuel combustion −can interact in
their formation processes.

2 H

A  dedicated  numerical  analysis  was  performed  to  investigate
soot and NO interactions in ethylene CDFs of the SF type [864] . The
model  included  a  detailed  reaction  mechanism  with  NOx  chem-
istry,  a  two-equation  semi-empirical  C
2 -based  soot  sub-model
[376] , and radiation heat loss from major gaseous species and soot
particles. Three simulation runs were conducted to investigate the
detailed mechanisms that determine how the presence of soot af-
fects NOx formation. In the first run (SIM1), both NOx and soot
models were included, and in the third run (SIM3) only the NOx
model was retained. The second run (SIM2) was computed with a
fixed temperature, obtained from SIM1, while all rates related to
soot were set to zero. As a result, the difference of the predicted
NOx concentrations between SIM2 and SIM3 was caused by purely
thermal effects from soot radiation. The differences between SIM1
and SIM2 were due to the chemical effect of soot formation, as
the production of soot is expected to alter the chemical structures
of the flames by −for example −consuming gaseous soot precursors.
Both thermal and chemical effects of soot on NO formation were
observed, as can be seen in Fig. 51 . In terms of the chemical effect,
analysis of the detailed reaction pathway suggests that the most
important competing species between soot and NOx chemistry is
C

2 .
On  the  other  hand,  comparison  between  two  numerical  runs
with and without the NOx sub-chemistry shows that the forma-
tion of NOx has a negligible effect on soot formation/oxidation in
the flames investigated. However, it should be noted that the au-
thors [864] only considered the effect of NO, and further investiga-
tions taking NO
2 formation into account may be needed. In addi-
tion, studies on more flame configurations, like SFO CDFs, are nec-
essary to confirm whether the insignificance of NOx on soot for-
mation can be generalized. This is especially relevant considering
that  in  SF  CDF,  the  peak  locations  of  NOx  and  soot  are,  in  fact,
spatially separated.

6. Summary, challenges, and prospects

In view of the growing global energy demand, conventional hy-
drocarbon  fuel  is  expected  to  continue  as  the  dominant  energy
source in the foreseeable future. However, the consensus is that
hazardous  emissions  from  the  combustion  of  hydrocarbon  fuels

223

must be mitigated for a sustainable future. As a ubiquitous com-
bustion phenomenon, soot formation has attracted continuous re-
search attention, not only because of its associated negative envi-
ronmental impact, but for the rich physicochemical processes in-
volved which are still not fully understood. Nevertheless, the out-
come from decades of fundamental research −especially those per-
formed in well-controlled laboratory-scale flames −confirms that it
is possible to describe soot formation from first principles.

Although the primary objective of this review is to provide a
comprehensive  summary  of  soot  research  performed  with  coun-
terflow  flames,  many  relevant  aspects  involve  fundamental  soot
mechanisms that are universally applicable and cannot be isolated
from other research. Therefore, the concluding remarks that follow
list several general challenges and opportunities for soot research,
before discussion of those more specific to counterflow flames.

As discussed extensively in the text, the conceptual stages of
soot  formation  include  (1)  gas  phase  molecular  growth  towards
large PAHs; (2) soot nucleation out of the gas phase; (3) surface
growth and particle-particle coagulations; and (4) soot oxidation
and fragmentation. Despite research progress made thus far, there
are still unresolved aspects in each of these processes that con-
tinue to challenge the soot research community. The most promi-
nent challenges (in our opinion) are as follows:

• Molecular growth from aliphatic fuels involves the formation
of the first aromatic ring, in most cases, benzene. Although
there are various reaction pathways for benzene formation,
and the relative importance of each pathway may depend
on fuel molecular structure, the number of pathways is fi-
nite, and fairly detailed knowledge is available about many
of them [172] . However, the story is far different for molec-
ular growth beyond benzene. As discussed in Section 2.1.2 ,
new pathways for PAH growth are being identified (and pro-
posed)  continuously.  But  experimental  validation  of  these
pathways becomes challenging since a) the concentration of
large PAHs are typically too low for accurate measurement;
and b) experimental techniques to resolve the many isomers
of large PAHs are limited. In fact, in view of the formidable
number  of  isomers  for  molecules  with  increasingly  larger
sizes, the question remains whether all the relevant path-
ways [865] can ever be captured. A relevant question is to
what details would we need for practical purposes.

• The transition from gas-phase molecular soot precursors to
condensed-phase particles has remained a mystery for many
decades.  The  assumption  of  physical  dimerization  of  PAHs
has been implemented in many soot models, successfully ex-
plaining many experimental observations. However, theoret-
ical  analysis  determined  that  at  flame  temperatures,  PAHs
with  enough  abundances  are  too  volatile  to  be  physically
linked. As such, it is believed that covalent interactions are
needed  to  bind  the  PAHs  to  form  molecular  clusters  (in-
cipient particles). While previous mechanisms for covalent
cluster formation required repeated high energy barrier ac-
tivation of stable PAHs (and thus not perfectly compatible
with  the  rapid  nucleation  of  soot,  even  in  low  tempera-
ture radical-starved regions), the recently proposed cluster-
ing of hydrocarbon by radical chain reaction (CHRCR) mech-
anism  [138]  highlights  the  role  of  radical  chain  propaga-
tion through resonantly stabilized radicals. This new CHRCR
mechanism  overcomes  the  issue  of  low  molecular  growth
rates  associated  with  existing  chemical  nucleation  mech-
anisms  and  also  allows  σ -dimerization  from  large  RSRs
[138,273] . Although promising, one challenge is that detailed
reaction  rates  must  be  established  for  the  proposed  reac-
tions so that an extensive kinetic mechanism can be assem-
bled to test whether CHRCR can explain experimental fea-

2 H

tures on soot formation. The target for testing may include,
for example, the bimodal size distribution in the post-flame
zone  of  a  premixed  stagnation  flame,  the  non-monotonic
variations  of  soot  formation  with  temperature  in  a  shock
tube and premixed flames, the synergistic effects between
fuels on soot formation in diffusion flames and many more.
Furthermore,  the  role  of  charged  ions  in  soot  nucleation
must be explored further; it is possible that different mech-
anisms can simultaneously contribute to soot nucleation.
• Reactions that occur on the surface of soot particles account
for  most  of  soot  mass  growth,  so  a  deeper  understanding
of these surface reactions is critical in order to predict the
amount of soot formed in flames and practical combustion
devices.  In  most  current  soot  models,  surface  reaction  is
dominated by the surface-HACA mechanism, in which C
2 H
2
is the most important mass growth agent. Rates for hetero-
geneous hydrogen abstraction and C
2  addition reactions
are  obtained  by  assuming  a  kinetic  analogy  between  soot
and gas phase aromatic species. Currently, however, it is un-
clear how and to what extent surface morphology, adsorp-
tion/desorption and other features specific to heterogeneous
reactions will affect these surface reactions [865] . The effects
of surface properties (e.g., graphitization) on soot growth are
yet  to  be  studied  quantitatively.  To  date,  there  is  no  fun-
damental models that describe how the surface properties
change as the soot particle evolves in the flame. Such lack
of detailed knowledge about surface reactions is reflected in
the  wide  variability  of  the  parameter  α (representing  the
fraction of surface site that is active for surface reactions)
in different soot models. It is a common practice to adjust
α to  match  experimental  soot  concentrations.  In  addition
2 , the recent CHRCR mechanism [138] also suggests
to C
that surface growth can proceed with radical-chain reactions
through  RSRs.  The  possibility  that  aliphatic  chains  can  be
present at the surface of nascent particles adds more com-
plexity to a complete description of surface reactions. It is
obvious that more fundamental research is required to gain
further  insights  into  the  heterogeneous  reactions  on  soot
surfaces.

2 H

• Soot oxidation is essential in determining ultimate soot pro-
duction, and in the regeneration of particulate filters, which
are  now  routinely  used  to  control  soot  emission  from  IC
engine-powered ground vehicles. The oxidation of soot in-
volves complex heterogeneous surface reactions; therefore,
many of the challenges associated with soot surface growth
discussed above also apply to soot oxidation. In addition, ex-
perimental evidence of the particle internal burning mode
[348] may also suggest the importance of surface diffusion
of oxidizing agents. However, many current models for soot
oxidation  are  still  largely  empirical  in  that  they  typically
take bulk carbon as the sole solid reactant, neglecting any
steric effects and the many different kinetic features of soot
formed in different environments. Intermediate products of
soot oxidation also require further research attention as it
was shown in SFO flames, the oxidation of soot may pro-
duce a second peak for PAH LIF signals, indicating the com-
plexity of soot oxidation products. It is clear that future re-
search  is  needed  to  uncover  more  detailed  and  sterically-
resolved  information  on  how  oxidizing  species  such  as  O,
OH, O
2 interact with soot particles for the removal
of soot mass.

2 and NO

In addition to these challenges, soot formation is further com-
plicated because of its dependence on many combustion param-
eters. The present review clearly demonstrates that research con-
ducted in counterflow flames has notably contributed to our un-

224

derstanding of the effects of fuel molecular structure, fuel/oxidizer
dilution,  pressure,  temperature,  residence  time,  flame  structure,
and unsteadiness on soot formation. Further investigations of the
underlying mechanisms of these phenomenological effects in turn
provide hints through which various aspects of soot formation fun-
damentals  can  be  uncovered.  This  review  also  identifies  several
challenges that must be addressed for more complete soot charac-
terization in counterflow flames and for further contributions to a
first principle understanding of soot. Following are some pertinent
issues, along with prospects for future research:

– Characterization  of  soot  in  counterflow  flames  is  typically
limited to soot volume fraction, primary particle size, and
total  number  densities,  while  more  detailed  information
such  as  particle  size  distribution  (PSD)  is  rarely  reported.
This is because conventional sampling methods are too in-
trusive  for  counterflow  flames,  which  have  a  very  narrow
sooting  zone  ( ∼1 mm).  However,  PSD  can  provide  valu-
able  information  about  nearly  all  aspects  of  soot  informa-
tion  and  it  is  essential  if  detailed  insight  is  to  be  de-
rived from counterflow flame experimental data. Future ef-
fort is needed to develop reliable, in-situ methods (e.g., time-
resolved LII) to measure PSD in CDFs. Challenges also exist
for the thermophoretic extraction of soot particles in coun-
terflow flames, because the TEM probe used in traditional
fast-insertion  methods  may  vibrate  too  much  to  allow  for
soot extraction at a specific location. The SiC wire method
developed by Figura and Gomez [508] may partly solve this
problem.

– The  narrow  sooting  zone  in  counterflow  flames  also  in-
dicates  that  complete  soot  evolution  from  gas-phase  soot
precursors  (via  nascent  particles  to  mature  soot  particles)
occurs  in  a  somewhat  confined  spatial  region,  necessitat-
ing high spatial resolution experimental techniques. Conven-
tional optical methods for quantitative soot measurements,
such as light extinction and scattering, are dependent on the
complex  refractive  index  of  soot,  which  is  known  to  vary
with particle size and maturity. However, a quantitative re-
lationship is yet to be determined. Additional methods may
be  necessary  (i.e.,  small  angle  X-ray  or  neutron  scattering
[866,867] ) to confirm the extent to which the varying optical
properties may affect the quantitative soot measurements in
counterflow flames.

– There  exist  a  number  of  counterflow  flame-based  studies
regarding  the  synergistic  effects  of  fuel  mixtures  on  PAH
and soot formation, demonstrating that certain binary fuel
mixtures can have higher sooting tendency than either fuel
component  (e.g.  [86,528,586] ).  These  works  highlight  the
importance  of  chemical  interactions  between  different  fu-
els  and  so  have  practical  application  for  fuel  formulation.
While  future  opportunities  exist  for  the  identification  and
kinetic  explanation  of  additional  fuel  pairs  exhibiting  syn-
ergistic effects, it is interesting to search fuel mixtures with
lower sooting tendencies than either component, which ex-
hibit a negatively synergistic effect.

– To  be  more  relevant  to  practical  combustion  systems  like
diesel  engines  and  jet  engines,  counterflow  flame  experi-
ments  must  be  extended  to  operate  with  liquid  fuels  at
high-pressure conditions. Although the counterflow configu-
ration is advantageous for controllable and stable flame op-
eration at elevated pressures (i.e., not sensitive to buoyancy-
driven  instability,  no  heat  loss  through  burner  rim)  [788] ,
it  is  important  to  design  boundary  conditions  carefully  so
that  pressure  effects  on  soot  formation  can  be  isolated
[537,618,788] . In terms of fuel types, studies on oxygenated
fuels with aromatic rings are scarce, but they deserve atten-

tion in future research because of their practical uses and
potentially different soot growth pathways, as compared to
other aliphatic and aromatic fuels.

– Counterflow flames are particularly suitable for studying the
effects of fuel-borne catalysts on soot formation and oxida-
tion (FBCs, like those metal-containing compounds reviewed
here). This is because the formation and oxidation of soot
can be separated by utilizing either SF or SFO flames. The
challenge  is  to  develop  effective  measurement  techniques
that distinguish soot and catalytic particles so that concen-
trations of each can be reliably determined. Possibilities in-
clude methods based on spectral emissions [868,869] , but it
should be considered that these methods need high spatial
resolution for applications in counterflow flames.

– Time-resolved experimental data on PAH, and soot in CDFs
subject to oscillating strain rates, are scarce [585,801] . Such
data can provide not only information about the unsteady
flamelet model, but it can validate kinetic models for PAH
and  soot  formation.  Peaks,  troughs,  and  mean  values  of
PAH/soot concentrations in oscillating flames, normalized by
their  steady-state  values,  provide  valuable  information  re-
garding the kinetics of their formation.
