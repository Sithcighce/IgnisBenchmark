Biomass is a promising renewable source that can reduce fossil fuel consumption and associated greenhouse gas
emissions, but some of its characteristics make it difficult to use in its raw form. Torrefaction has been proposed
as a thermochemical pretreatment to upgrade biomass for direct applications such as combustion and gasifica-
tion,  biochar  and  chemicals  production,  while  reducing  its  transportation  cost  and  increasing  its  shelf-life.
Research,  development,  and  demonstration  of  biomass  torrefaction  technologies  have  advanced  during  the
last few decades, but many science and engineering fundamentals as well as technological challenges remain,
especially in the areas of reaction thermodynamics and kinetics, reactor models and design, large-scale imple-
mentation,  and  environmental  performance.  In  this  paper  we  present  a  comprehensive  review  of  recent  de-
velopments  in  biomass  torrefaction  research  and  technology  focusing  on  kinetics,  particle  and  reactor  scale
models, and reactor designs. The impacts of torrefaction as a pretreatment of biomass on subsequent conversion
processes, and the novel applications of torrefied biomass are discussed. The energy management, environmental
impacts, economic and market potential of the technology as well as the deployment options are also addressed.
There  is  no  best  universal  torrefaction  reactor  and  hence  the  choice  should  be  made  based  on  the  biomass
feedstock and the expected production rate and application. To reduce process costs and competition with other
uses  of  biomass,  the  utilization  of  either  waste  or  environmentally  sustainable,  more  abundant,  and  faster
growing  biomass  should  be  targeted  for  this  technology.  Torrefied  biomass  produced  at  higher  temperatures
resemble pyrolysis biochar in several properties thereby making it suitable for most biochar applications. Finally,
considering  the  need  to  identify  the  bottlenecks  that  potentially  could  limit  the  use  of  torrefaction,  and  its
preceding or subsequent processes, the future prospects, challenges, and opportunities of torrefaction technology
are presented.

1. Introduction

Growing  energy  demand,  rising  prices  of  fossil  fuels  especially  in
rural and remote areas, and emerging environmental issues have driven

the efforts towards exploring alternative energy sources. Global energy
demand is expected to grow by about 1.3% per year between 2020 and
2030  with  developed  countries  showing  annual  rise  of  0.1%,  and
developing countries showing annual rise of 2% [1]. Excessive use of

conventional fossil fuels have led economic concerns while also result-
ing in challenging environmental problems, especially related to carbon
dioxide  (CO2) emissions  [2].  Energy  efficiency  and  renewable  energy
sources  such  as  solar,  wind,  geothermal,  hydro,  and  biomass  are  key
contributors to satisfying the growing energy demand while mitigating
the environmental concerns. Bioenergy has been the largest source of
renewable energy, and is expected to experience the 14% higher con-
sumption in the industrial heat sector in the year 2026 [3]. The global
yearly production of biomass is equivalent to 55.6 EJ (exa = 1018) with
85% coming from lignocellulosic biomass [4]. Nearly 5% of this energy
should  be  enough  to  cover  half  of  the  total  primary  energy  demand
world-wide.  However,  at  present,  bioenergy  satisfies  only  9%  of  the
world’s total primary energy demand, and half of it is linked to tradi-
tional  biomass  usage  in  rural  communities  for  cooking  and  heating,
using inefficient open fires or simple cookstoves with adverse impacts on
health and the environment [1,3].

The renewable nature, cheaper and wider availability, and carbon
carrying potential of biomass makes it a preferable energy source [5].
Biomass is a broader term usually defined as organic materials produced
by the photosynthetic activities of plants. The crops and trees that form
or produce food for human and other living organisms such as animals,
birds,  and  aquatic  species  are  also  types  of  biomass.  However,  ligno-
cellulosic biomass such as fire wood, crop or farm residue, energy crops,
and kitchen or garden waste do not compete with human food resources
[6,7]. For sustainable use, pressure is mounting to utilize non-food crops
and waste biomass, and to develop technologies for the most efficient
processing  of  such  feedstock  into  energy,  fuels,  or  other  products
currently derived from fossil sources [8].

Lignocellulose  is  the  fibrous  material  forming  the  cell  wall  of  the
plants, consisting of three major components - cellulose, hemicellulose,
and lignin. The chemical and physical properties of each of these con-
stituents  are  discussed  elsewhere  [9].  The  first  two  are  essentially
polysaccharides  and  fibrous  polysaccharides,  which  are  hydrolyzable
and  fermentable  sugars,  while  the  last  is  a  polymer  of  benzene  rings
linked with aliphatic chains. This is in contrast to the “green” part of the
plant, seeds and fruits that are rich in proteins, starch oils, simple sugars
as  well  as  other  organic  and  inorganic  components,  such  as  minerals
[10]. Different types of biomass can be procured from different sources
such as agriculture, forestry, industrial, municipal and residential. The
processes  of  converting  biomass  into  energy  include  thermochemical
conversions, biochemical conversions, and mechanical modes such as oil
extraction.

Bioenergy with carbon capture and sequestration/storage (BECCS)
has  received  increased  attention  recently  as  it  can  produce  fuels,
chemicals, and electricity while reducing atmospheric CO2. Biochemical
conversion  has  been  demonstrated  for  BECCS  but  it  has  not  been
commercialized  at  mass  scale.  Thermochemical  based  BECCS  is
receiving  more  attention  because  of  its  feedstock  flexibility  [11].
Though biomass is attractive as a carbon neutral energy source, some of
its  characteristics  make  it  a  challenging  fuel.  For  instance,  there  are
more limitations in energy production process when using biomass in its
raw form than when using fossil fuel [6,12]. The wet, loose, and bulky
nature  of  raw  biomass  makes  it  difficult  and  expensive  to  collect,
transport, process, and utilize in energy applications. Properties such as
low density, high oxygen and moisture content, low heating value, and
hydrophilicity  pose  a  challenge  for  maximizing  the  energy  output  of
biomass.  Other  challenges  in  processing  biomass  are  related  to  its
fibrous  structure  and  heterogeneous  composition,  which  complicate
process design and control, often having impact on energy production
logistics. Furthermore, certain biomass types such as agricultural wastes
are  seasonal,  and  all  forms  of  plant  material  are  biodegradable,  and
hence cannot be stored for long times. Others such as waste vegetables,
leaves litter, and grass collected from urban areas are often transported
to landfills.

Pretreatment or upgrading of biomass helps improve its utilization in
subsequent conversion processes. Most common pretreatment processes

are drying and densification (e.g., pelletization, briquetting), as well as
the different types of pyrolysis. Products of pyrolysis can also have direct
application as fuel or chemical.

◦

Torrefaction is a thermochemical pretreatment to upgrade biomass
to  a  product  retaining  up  to  90%  of  its  original  energy  [13,14].  The
process  resembles  pyrolysis  at  low  heating  rates  and  at  temperatures
C. The process products depend on different parame-
lower than 350
ters,  besides  the  original  biomass,  such  as  the  reaction  temperature,
heating rate, residence time, and reaction medium. Torrefied biomass is
an excellent solid energy carrier with several advantages compared to
the raw biomass. The majority of recent studies have been concerned
with investigating its chemistry, testing of diverse feedstocks, evaluating
equipment performance and design, and elucidation of the supply chain
impact  on  the  technology.  The  literature  reports  numerous  studies
investigating the effect of most of these parameters for a diverse range of
biomass feedstock. Other studies focus on reactor design [15–17], tor-
refaction  medium  [18–20],  reaction  kinetics  and  modeling  [21–23],
techno-economic analysis [24,25], and life cycle analysis [26,27]. Few
books on the topic have been published in the last 10 years [28–30].
There have also been some reviews on the subject, some are discussed in
the next section.

1.1. Reviews on torrefaction

The first set of journal articles reviewing torrefaction were published
in 2011, providing insight into biomass potential for power and liquid-
fuel production [12,31–33]. The authors explained torrefaction process
and highlighted the potential of the technology towards changing the
physical, chemical, and rheological characteristics of biomass materials,
to  improve  the  supply,  transportation,  and  logistics  for  large  scale
centralized production facilities (dozens of ton per hour). Subsequently
few  more  articles  were  published  which  primarily  reviewed  existing
torrefaction technologies and applications, and provided recommenda-
tions for further commercialization [34–37]. Some reviews focused on
analyzing the potential of torrefaction when integrated with densifica-
tion  processes  such  as  pelletization  [9,38–40],  and  subsequent  appli-
cations. Torrefied pellets are often found to be eco-friendlier but more
expensive  than coal or  wood pellets  because of the  additional invest-
ment  for  torrefaction  reactor.  These  studies  recommended  including
torrefaction as a unit operation in biomass supply chain closer to source
to ensure commoditization.

Few studies approached the technology from techno-economic and
environmental perspective [41–44]. The cost associated with procure-
ment  of  raw  material  is  found  to  have  the  highest  impact  on  overall
economics of torrefaction. More recently, few reviews [43,45,46] have
addressed the principles, applications and challenges of the torrefaction
technology for different biomass feedstocks. Though these review arti-
cles covered a wide range of aspects related to torrefaction, a critical
comprehensive  review  of  biomass  torrefaction  addressing  process  pa-
rameters,  kinetics,  modeling,  novel  applications,  environmental  per-
formance, deployment and market prospects is not evident. Fig. 1 shows
the progress made in the area of torrefaction in the last four decades
citing some of the important contributions during specific periods. As of
June 2022, when the article titles of last 12 years were searched for the
terms ‘torrefaction’ and ‘torrefied’, Google Scholar showed 3290 results
(starting  from  69  in  2010)  and  Scopus  showed  1997  results  (starting
from 14 in 2010), clearly reflecting the growing interest in the area.

1.2. Objective of this review

While  the  number  of  studies  on  biomass  torrefaction  has  been
growing, the technology is yet to reach a large commercial scale, and the
economics are not yet clear. On the technical side, improvements are
still needed on multiple fronts such as the kinetics, reactor design, fuel
flexibility, process control, heat integration, scale-up, to name a few. On
marketing  side,  feedstock  availability,  transport,  environmental  and

economic  performance,  plant  size,  and  site  selection  are  some  of  the
major concerns. However, as the interest in the area is growing rapidly
and so are the number of research articles, a critical and comprehensive
review  including  fundamentals  to,  lab  scale  studies,  to  pilot  level  in-
stallations and upcoming commercial set-ups is needed. The objective of
this work is to fill this gap by critically reviewing recent developments in
the  torrefaction  engineering  and  technology  focusing  on  process  pa-
rameters, kinetics and modeling, reactor design, applications, environ-
mental performance, deployment, and market opportunities. Based on
various sources of biomass, the biofuels have evolved from first gener-
ation (food crops) to fourth generation (modified algal and microbial
systems),  where  the  most  preferred  torrefaction  feedstock  of  inedible
lignocellulosic  biomass  belongs  to  second  generation.  Hereafter,  the
term “biomass” symbolizes lignocellulosic biomass such as wood, crops,
leaves litter, and forest and agricultural residues. The influence of tor-
refaction on the performance of other biomass conversion processes is
also discussed. Finally, future prospects and challenges related to tor-
refaction technology are presented.

2. Fundamentals of torrefaction

Torrefaction is defined as a thermochemical process in the range of
◦
200–300
C often under atmospheric pressure in the absence or limited
presence of oxygen (0–21%), though higher pressures can be employed
in  certain  cases.  The  process  removes  the  moisture  and  partially  de-
composes  the  lignocellulosic  components  liberating  some  volatiles,
leaving behind a solid product referred to as “torrefied biomass”, “bio-
coal” or “biochar” [47,48]. The overall process can be represented by

◦

Biomass torrefaction involves extensive decomposition of hemicel-
lulose  from  200
C  and  slight  decomposition  of  lignin  and  cellulose
◦
between 250–300
C. The breakdown of these components at different
temperatures  is  discussed  later  in  Section  3.1.  Torrefaction  products
depend on the biomass type, reaction medium, temperature, and resi-
dence  time at the  torrefaction temperature.  The solids yield (both on
mass  and  energy  basis)  decreases  with  temperature  between  200  to
◦
300
C, and is lower in oxidative medium (limited oxygen) than in inert
medium because of the oxidation of some solids along with the volatiles.
The main products are solids (in the form of char, original sugar struc-
tures,  and  ash)  and  the  volatiles  which  consist  of  mainly  non-
condensable gases and some condensable or liquids (mainly water, or-
ganics  and  lipids)  [49].  Biomass  undergoing  torrefaction  loses  more
oxygen and hydrogen than carbon, thereby increasing the heating value
of the product char. Also, C–C bonds have higher energy than C–O and
C–H  bonds  [50].  The  improved  properties  of  torrefied  biomass  are
mainly  attributed  to  the  removal  of  oxygen  from  raw  biomass  in  the
form of gaseous components (CO2, H2O and CO) and liquid compounds
(e.g.,  acids,  phenols,  furans  and  ketones).  Studies  that  examined  the
biomass deoxygenation mechanism during torrefaction reported CO2 as
the  dominant  oxygen  carrier  in  the  gaseous  product,  and  variable
dominant  carriers  in  the  liquid  product.  For  liquid  product,  oxygen
transferred  to  acids,  furans,  ketones  and  aldehydes  is  favored  under
lower  temperatures  (<250  °C),  while  more  oxygen  is  transferred  to
phenols at higher temperatures (>250 °C) [51,52].

description of the process showing variation of different chemical con-
stituents of biomass during the course of torrefaction. The process starts
with  drying  followed  by  depolymerization  and  recondensation,  and
devolatilization  and  carbonization  to  different  extents.  The  extent  of
devolatilization  and  carbonization  increases  with  temperature  and  so
does the destruction of most inter- and intramolecular hydrogen, C–C,
and C–O bonds. The change in biomass color from yellow to brown and
black  at  different  temperature  regimes  is  attributed  to  compositional
changes,  and  can  be  a  rough  indicator  for  torrefaction  severity.  The
detailed explanation can be found in [12,46].

Fig. 3 shows  the van  Krevelen diagram  which cross-plots  the H/C
atomic  ratio  against  O/C  atomic  ratio  for  different  types  of  coal  and
biomass, and the pure lignocellulosic components. The position of ma-
jority biomass on this plot gives an impression of biomass torrefaction as

superposition of torrefaction of individual components. Anthracite has
the lowest O/C and H/C ratios with almost zero oxygen, and more than
95%  carbon,  having  a  heating  value  of  26–33  MJ/kg  and  very  low
volatile content [53]. The H/C and O/C molar ratios for raw biomass is
in the range of 1.4–1.6 and 0.6–0.8 respectively, so a typical chemical
formula  for  dry  raw  biomass  is  CH1.5O0.7,  with  heating  value  in  the
range of 16–22 MJ/kg. These ratios tend to decrease, and the heating
value  tends  to  increase  with  the  severity  of  torrefaction  (higher  tem-
perature, heating rate, and residence time). The average heating value of
torrefied biomass is in the range of 20–25 MJ/kg. Increasing the extent
of torrefaction reduces H/C and O/C ratios, thereby bringing torrefied
biomass  close  to  the  properties  of  coal  and  charcoal.  The  typical
chemical formula can be roughly represented by CH1.2O0.4 (but can tend
to CH0.8O0.2 for high severity torrefaction) [45]. Hence, it can be a good

substitute for coal, charcoal, wood, and other raw biomass in a variety of
applications.

In a reactor, biomass feedstock, upon heating, goes through several
stages before reaching the actual torrefaction regime. Fig. 4 shows the
different stages in the process of heating biomass in terms of the time-
temperature histogram for a typical batch reactor along with the vari-
ation trends of dry mass yield and moisture content (it also represents
the process occurring at position L in a continuous flow reactor with the
solids traveling in plug-flow with velocity u = L/t). The initial stages of
pre-drying  and  drying  are  followed  by  post-drying  and  intermediate
heating stages before entering the torrefaction stage. As the temperature
◦
increases to 200
C, physically bound water vaporizes along with some
light  organic  compounds.  Torrefaction  starts  after  this  point,  and  in-
cludes a heating period and a cooling period, besides a period of con-
stant temperature, mostly referred to as torrefaction temperature for an
experimental run. Final stage is cooling of solids during which no further
mass loss occurs, but some evaporation of adsorbed reaction products
may occur. For fixed operating conditions, the duration of these stages
will  depend  on  the  biomass  properties,  mainly,  moisture  content  and
particle  size.  Table  1  shows  the  heat  requirements  during  different
stages in a torrefaction reactor. The heat duty required for the drying
stage is often the highest and depends on the initial moisture content of
the  biomass.  The post-drying  and intermediate  heating stages usually
have lower heat requirements than drying but higher than torrefaction.
Torrefaction  can  have  both  endothermic  and  exothermic  reactions
depending  on  the  biomass  composition,  operating  condition,  and  the
decomposition  regime.  The  experimentally  measured  and  model  pre-
dicted values of heat of torrefaction varies widely from (cid:0) 387 kJ/kg to
540 kJ/kg [14,58,59]. Some studies have reported the overheating of
the reactor and found that it is dependent on the feedstock properties
such as thermal conductivity, particle size, and average heat release rate
primarily due to thermal decomposition of hemicellulose [21,60].

Different  biomass  performs  differently  for  the  same  set  of  torre-
faction conditions primarily because of the difference in the chemical
composition  and  physical  properties.  Table  S1  (please  refer  to  supple-
mentary material) lists some of the common biomass feedstocks tested at
different torrefaction conditions. Most studies examined the process at
◦
different scales over a range of temperatures (200-300
C) and residence
times (30–60 min). The energy yield (EY) follows a similar trend to mass
yield (MY) of solid product but it is higher than MY for all the biomass
studied in literature.

The  applications  of  torrefied  biomass  depend  on  its  structure,

composition, and properties, which makes it important to analyze these
parameters using different characterization techniques. In general, the
surface and morphological characterization of the initial raw and final
torrefied  biomass  is  done  by  scanning  electron  microscopy  (SEM),
Fourier transform infrared analysis (FTIR), and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller
(BET). The variation in structural and molecular properties is generally
analyzed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD),
X-ray  photoelectron  spectroscopy  (XPS),  and  nuclear  magnetic  reso-
nance  (NMR).  Each  of  these  techniques  have  been  comprehensively
reviewed in the context of biomass torrefaction in the literature [46].

2.1. Types of torrefaction

Two types of torrefaction processes have been commonly proposed
based on the primary phase of the medium - dry torrefaction (DT) and
wet  torrefaction  (WT),  though  few  studies  have  explored  other  types

such as high pressure torrefaction [63,64], steam torrefaction [65,66]
and gas-pressurized torrefaction [67,68]. DT often recognized as mild
pyrolysis,  reactive  or  high  temperature  drying,  and  roasting,  is  most
widely  studied  and  applied  for  a  range  of  biomass.  Unless  specified,
conventional torrefaction treatment is presumed to be dry. The scope of
DT  has  been  extended  to  include  torrefaction  in  the  presence  of
non-inert  gaseous  medium  (e.g.,  CO2,  O2,  air,  NH3),  and  at  different
pressures. Almost all the commercial and pilot plants conduct DT in inert
medium to achieve higher solid mass and energy yields. However, it has
been observed that the oxidative medium, if appropriately employed,
may  substantially  reduce  the  capital  and  operational  costs  associated
with the reactor [69,70].

◦

WT  terminology  came  later,  and  may  be  defined  as  treatment  of
biomass  in  a  hydrothermal  media,  or  hot  compressed  water,  at  tem-
peratures  of  180–260
C,  often  at  elevated  pressures  in  the  range  of
15–250 bar [71,72]. In WT process, water is kept in the liquid phase,
avoiding  the  energy  loss  in  the  form  of  latent  heat  of  vaporization.
Therefore, the process is conducted at pressures higher than the satu-
rated  vapor  pressure  of  the  water  at  the  WT  temperature  [73].  The
behavior of the three main biomass components is more complex in a
hydrothermal media than in an inert gas atmosphere. With the increase
in torrefaction severity, the rate of decrease in mass and energy yields of
solid product is slower for WT, but is relatively faster for DT [72,74]. WT
employs liquid water as the reaction medium and hence can work with
aquatic residues, algal biomass, and other moist biomass wastes. While
the most preferred route for WT is neutral hydrolysis, alkaline or acid
hydrolysis  is  also  possible.  The  process  has  been  described  in  detail
[75–77]  and  has  also  been  compared  with  DT  [78,79].  Torrefaction
using  steam  explosion,  a  method  primarily  used  for  bioethanol  pro-
duction, is another variant of WT that has been investigated for Douglas
Fir  concentrating on resultant solid products [80]. Table 2 shows the
comparison between dry and wet torrefaction.

2.2. Index of torrefaction

Several attempts have been made to define indicators or indices for
severity or degree of torrefaction. Table 3 presents the definitions and
applications of some of these indices.

Weight loss or solid mass yield [81,91,92] primarily obtained from
TGA is the first indicator used to determine torrefaction severity with

some studies utilizing it to correlate the properties of torrefied biomass
[93,94].  The  reliable  measurement  of  weight  loss  at  a  specific  torre-
faction temperature and residence time can be challenging in a contin-
uous process on a commercial scale. Lee et al. [83] used the severity
factor (SF) earlier proposed by [95] for biomass pretreatment, to explain
the  torrefaction  severity  based  on  temperature  and  duration.  SF  was
later modified to TSF to address the nature and sensitivity of the biomass
using an exponential time parameter α [84]. When compared to SF, TSF
showed better match for the linear correlations with the properties of
torrefied  biomass.  To  overcome  the  issues  related  to  weight  loss

determination, Chen et al. [86] introduced torrefaction severity index
(TSI) to indicate the thermal degradation extent of biomass considering
the severe condition as the reference. The value of TSI ranges from 0 at
the start of torrefaction to 1 at the most severe condition (300 °C, 1 h).
Other  indicators  employed  by  specific  studies  include  energy-mass
co-benefit index (EMCI) [82] and relative energy efficiency (REE) [87].
The use of the mass loss or the change in carbon concentration to the
mass yield as a severity index is likely more useful for applications where
fixed carbon is the main target, such as in the metallurgical industries.
The  energy  sector,  potentially  being  the  largest  user  of  torrefied
biomass,  would  prefer  a  product  with  the  highest  energy  density  to
minimize transportation costs for reducing the cost of a fuel produced at
the feedstock source. Using the energy yield alone as the index of tor-
refaction  may  be  misleading  because  the  highest  energy  yield  corre-
sponds to mild torrefaction. Mass yield (MY), used in some studies to
define the quality of torrefaction, is related to the energy yield and/or
energy density, but the relationship is not as direct as it is for energy
density enhancement factor (EDEF) [88]. Following the suggestion in
[88], 235
C were chosen as the bracketing temperatures
between light-to-mild and mild-to-severe torrefaction, respectively.

C and 275

◦

◦

The arbitrary reference condition specified in [88] was simplified by
defining the index of torrefaction (Itorr) as the ratio of the higher heating
value  of  the  torrefied  biomass  to  the  higher  heating  value  of  raw
biomass, as reported in [90]. According to this definition, any form of
energy densification implies Itorr > 1. Same definition was applied in a
study on oxidative torrefaction of three different nutshells, and the index
was termed as HHV enhancement factor [93]. However, the role of the
enhancement  factor  in  the  reactor  design  and  scale-up  was  not  dis-
cussed. Kung et al. [90] showed a quantifiable functional relationship
between  the  defined  index  and  the  characteristics  of  the  torrefied
biomass. They correlated the index of torrefaction to solid yield, energy
densification, proximate and ultimate analysis, grindability, and cook-
ing characteristics [96].

If an indicator of torrefaction severity is linked to a specific property
of the torrefied product, it can provide a valuable insight to select the
appropriate biomass and the operating conditions for a specific appli-
cation. Kung et al. [90] showed the utility of Itorr on the air-fuel ratio and
residence time map, in selecting the desired operating condition for a
specific biomass in the moving bed reactor. A recent study [89] assessed
five indicators (WL, TSI, SF, TSF, and Itorr,) for hardwood torrefaction
and  inferred  WL  and  TSI  to  be  better  indicators  for  devolatalization
process, and SF, TSF, and Itorr to be better indicators for solid properties.
The mapping correlations eliminates the need to re-run the reactor over
a range of operating conditions to narrow down the selection of biomass
or  optimum  operating  conditions.  Hence,  it  is  worth  investigating  if
other  factors  can  be  presented  as  a  reliable  function  of  this  primary
parameter,  and  used  selectively  for  a  particular  application.  Future
research works may develop new indicators and correlations or impro-
vise on existing ones, in order to assist the reactor designers as well as
operators.

3. Influence of different factors on torrefaction

Torrefaction is influenced by several factors that include the biomass
composition and the operation conditions of the reactor. The outcome of
torrefaction  of  different  biomass  species  depends  on  the  chemical
composition,  temperature,  residence  time,  heating  rate,  particle  size,
and the process medium as discussed in detail in this section.

3.1. Biomass composition

Biomass composition includes primarily the organic matter such as
cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin and extractives, and inorganic matter in
the form of ash. The nature and source of biomass determines the rela-
tive proportions of these constituents. For example, most woody biomass
has higher cellulose (~39–54%) and lignin (~17–30%) contents than

◦
C, 275–500

herbaceous and agricultural biomass [97, 98]. The respective degrada-
tion  temperature  ranges  for  hemicellulose,  cellulose,  and  lignin  are
◦
200–450
C [99]. Torrefaction starts from
◦
200
C primarily with the decomposition of hemicellulose, however, the
physicochemical characteristics of biomass changes more significantly
◦
C with degradation of some lignin and
at higher temperatures after 250
some cellulose (Fig. 5).

◦
C, and 130–900

Chen et al. [100] investigated the torrefaction and co-torrefaction of
the pure species of hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin in the tempera-
ture  range  of  200–300
C  in  a  TGA,  and  confirmed  that  there  is  no
synergistic effect of the blend of these species. The co-torrefaction ki-
netics for the mixture of these three major constituents of biomass was
defined as

◦

X = xHemXHem + xCelXCel + xLigXLig

(2)

◦

where X is the conversion, and x is the mass fraction of a constituent in a
given  sample  of  biomass.  The  correlation  predicted  the  torrefaction
process  accurately  up  to  275
C,  but  the  difference  between  the  pre-
dicted  and  experimental  results  increased  beyond  this  temperature.
Such  linear  superposition  of  conversion  of  the  lignocellulosic  compo-
nents was also suggested by Rousset et al. [101] for low temperature
pyrolysis of wood. Lv et al. [102] investigated the torrefaction charac-
teristics  for  cellulose  in  the  temperature  range  of  200–300
C  in  a
TGA-DSC, and inferred the mass loss as a surrogate of torrefaction in-
tensity up to 50% mass loss. A later study [54] observed two decom-
position stages for xylan with a notable release in CO that increased with
temperature. They also showed that cellulose was thermally stable at
◦
short times under all conditions except at 280
C and higher. Zheng et al.
[103]  studied  the  effect  of  structural  changes  of  individual  biomass
components on pyrolysis, and confirmed the rank order of thermal sta-
bility during torrefaction as being cellulose > lignin > hemicellulose.
Though  these  studies  provided  significant  understanding  of  biomass
torrefaction,  the  characterized  yields  of  solid,  liquid,  and  gaseous
products using cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin was not systemati-
cally investigated.

◦

Chen  et  al.  [104] covered  this research  gap and  reported that the
yield  of  solid  product  from  hemicellulose  torrefaction  was  the  lowest
among the three components, whereas the yield of liquid and gaseous
products were the highest as shown in Fig. 6. Carbon to oxygen atomic
ratios of the three components increased after torrefaction, with hemi-
cellulose  showing  the  most  remarkable  variation.  Gaseous  products
from the torrefaction of the three major components were CO2, followed
by CO, and very small amounts of CH4  and H2. With increasing tem-
perature  from  210–300
C,  hemicellulose,  cellulose,  and  lignin,
respectively,  released  about  19.76–71.11%,  5.85–33.27%,  and
16.28–44.89% of oxygen, that got converted to the liquid and gaseous
products,  with  water,  CO2,  and  CO  being  the  major  carriers.  The
dominant  deoxygenation  pathways  included  dehydration  followed  by
volatilization  of  the  oxygenated  gaseous  product.  On  the  other  hand,

further in the section on the catalyst.

Other than the lignocellulosic components and extractives, moisture
is  also  a  part  of  the  raw  biomass  and  some  studies  have  specifically
investigated  the  effect  of  moisture  content  on  torrefaction  [41].  The
moisture  content  of  various  biomass  studied  for  torrefaction  in  the
literature ranges between 5 to 40%, with majority having an average
moisture content of 10%. The effect of moisture is more pronounced at
◦
C) [114] and for larger particles (r >10
lower temperatures (below 225
mm) because of longer heating period [21]. Bates and Ghoniem [21]
noticed  that  the  moisture  content  has  no  effect  on  the  processes  that
occurs  after the  biomass particles  are  dry, e.g., exothermal overshoot
during torrefaction. The facilities having a separate dryer before torre-
faction  unit,  need  not  worry  about  the  sensitivity  of  torrefaction  to
moisture content. But, the initial moisture content of raw biomass will
significantly change the utilities required for dryer, and those must be
accounted for operating cost calculations.

3.2. Temperature

Among all the variables of torrefaction process, temperature is the
most  significant  variable  as  it  dominantly  affects  the  rates  of  the  re-
actions, and hence the product yields and the composition [115,116].
The general trends observed with increasing temperature are decreasing
mass  and  energy  yields  but  increasing  energy  density  of  the  solid
product. The effects of temperature can be described in terms of changes
in  moisture  content,  heating value,  weight loss,  carbonization extent,
ash  content,  and  biomass  size  reduction  [117].  Several  studies  have
investigated these effects for woody and non-woody biomass, as shown
in Table S1 (please refer to supplementary material), in the temperature
range of 200–300

C.

◦

◦

Fig. 7 shows the effect on the HHV and mass yield of solid product for
different biomass species  for a  residence  time of 30  min. HHV  of the
solid product increases gradually with torrefied logging residue and pine
having  the  highest  values  of  25.5  and  26.5  MJ/kg,  respectively,  at
300
C.  Similarly,  the  mass  yield  of  solid  decreases  gradually  with
increasing the temperature but the decline is relatively higher towards
C).  Medic  et  al.  [114]  studied  the  torre-
the  higher  end  (above  250
faction of corn stover in an inert medium and developed the quantitative
relationship for predicted mass loss (MLp) and energy yield (EYp) based
on the experimental observations as

◦

MLp = 95.68 (cid:0) 1.0396T + 0.2491M + 0.00284T 2

EYp = 10.0379 (cid:0) 0.0144M + 0.9278T (cid:0) 0.00721M2 (cid:0) 0.002461T 2

about 6.35–34.37%, 2.26–14.43%, and 3.22–12.51% of the carbon from
hemicellulose, cellulose, and  lignin was respectively  transformed into
liquid and gaseous products.

◦

Cellulose  has a  higher  carbon content and  better thermal stability
than lignin and hemicellulose, and contributes to major energy content
in  biomass  [105].  The  energy  content  of  cellulose  (17  MJ/kg)  and
hemicellulose (18 MJ/kg) are lower than that of lignin (23–27 MJ/kg)
[98]. Hence, biomass with higher cellulose and lignin contents but with
lower hemicelluloses would be preferred to produce torrefied biomass.
Some studies have analyzed the physicochemical transformations of
biomass  and  its  constituents  during  torrefaction.  Wen  et  al.  [106]
studied  the  lignin  transformations  of  bamboo  using  FTIR  and
solution-state  nuclear  magnetic  resonance  (NMR)  techniques.  They
found  that  the  increase  in  temperature  promoted  the  integration  of
condensed aromatic carbons because of the increase in condensation of
lignin.  Also, the  disordered  or amorphous  cellulose starts to get  crys-
talline within 200–225
C, which degrades further at higher tempera-
◦
tures, 250–300
C. Other studies on torrefaction of loblolly pine and fast
growing  poplar biomass reported deacetylation  and decomposition  of
hemicellulose, cleavage of aryl ether linkages and demethoxylation of
lignin, degradation of cellulose as the reactions taking place, resulting in
overall  increased  aromaticity  of  biomass  [105,107].  Mei  et  al.  [108]
determined  the  main  deoxidization  temperature  range  of  cellulose  as
290–320
C,  which  corresponded  to  removal  of  46.32%  oxygen  and
aromatization of cellulose. The release of moisture and volatiles during
torrefaction affects the porous structure of the biomass. Until 230
C,
dehydration contributes to the removal of hydroxyl and generation of
C, hydroxyl is transformed to carboxyl and
micropores, but after 230
conjugated ketone, and pore structure is reconstructed [109]. In addi-
tion to lignocellulosic biomass and its constituents, some other types of
biomass  have  also  been  investigated  for  torrefaction.  Owing  to
increasing  importance  of algal  biomass in  the  bioenergy sector, some
studies have investigated torrefaction of various microalgae and mac-
roalgae with the objective of producing good co-firing fuel with higher
grindability index for coal power plants [86,110].

◦

◦

◦

The constituents of biomass respond differently to torrefaction and
hence, it is possible to see diverse performance for different feedstock in
the same reactor at same operating conditions. A recent study confirmed
from FTIR analysis that the cellulose in hardwoods is easier to degrade
than that of softwoods in the torrefaction temperature range [111]. In
addition to the organic fraction of biomass, inorganic constituents such
as  potassium  plays  a  role  in  torrefaction  performance,  especially  at
temperatures higher than 250
C [112,113]. Higher percentages of po-
tassium  show  a  catalytic  effect  on  the  process,  which  offer  several
benefits in terms of time savings, product flexibility, enhanced biofuel
properties,  and  a  wider  range  of  applications.  This  will  be  discussed

where T is temperature in
C and M is the moisture content in wt% dry
basis. The relations show a strong dependency of the predicted yields on
temperature over moisture content.

◦

Fig. 8 shows the general variation trends in torrefied biomass char-
acteristics  with  the  increase  in  torrefaction  temperature.  Torrefied
biomass is known to have more uniform properties than raw biomass
[12], and the increase in temperature favor this further. The moisture
retaining capacity of a biomass decreases with the temperature of tor-
refaction [35], which is similar to the rise in hydrophobicity of biomass
with  increasing  torrefaction  temperature  with  few  exceptions.  The
temperature also affects the particle size and grindability of the product
in subsequent operations. A study confirmed significantly higher frac-
◦
tion of finer particles after milling sample of biomass torrefied at 275
C
than at 225
C [120]. Higher the extent of carbonization, lower is the
power  required  for  grinding,  but  it  may  have  an  opposite  effect  on
densifying or pelletizing the torrefied biomass. Compared to raw or less
torrefied biomass, highly torrefied materials require higher pressure for
pellet  discharge,  and  hence  more  energy  for  pelleting.  However,  the
extent of torrefaction could have different influence on the mechanical
strength  of the  pellets  depending  on the  biomass.  A  study  found  that
torrefaction benefited birch and spruce in terms of less hygroscopicity,
higher energy density, and better grindability [120]. Though the process
had a positive impact on the strength of birch pellets, the strength of
spruce  pellets  was  reduced  after  torrefaction.  The  other  property
affected by temperature is the color of the torrefied product which turns
darker with increasing the temperature for a fixed residence time.

In addition to product characteristics, the process temperature also
affects  the  operational  factors  such  as  heat  losses  and  the  utility
requirement. For example, higher temperature generates more volatiles,
which if not utilized will result in waste of energy. Also, solid product
coming out of the reactor operating at higher temperatures will pose a
fire hazard, if not cooled quickly. The effect of temperature on reaction
kinetics  and  other  parameters  involved  in  reactor  modeling  will  be
discussed in later sections.

3.3. Heating rate and particle size

◦

The  heating  rate  of  a  portion  of  biomass  that  is  being  torrefied  is
determined by both the heating rate of the device and the particle size of
feedstock. For the low temperatures applied in torrefaction, the warm-
up  phase  is  relatively  short  at  slow  heating  rates  of  10–100
C/min
commonly  applied  in  TGA  equipment,  and  the  marginal  weight  loss
during this phase is acceptable [14,121]. However, the heating rate has
been observed to have some impact on the yield of torrefaction products,
though much less than that of temperature. Williams and Besler [122]
investigated the slow pyrolysis of pine wood in a static batch reactor at
◦
300–720
C/min. For the experiments
◦
conducted at 300
C and 120 min, the char yield increased from 53% to
61%, and oil and gas yields dropped down slightly with increasing the
heating rate, as shown in Fig. 9a. Mamvura et al. [123] studied the effect
of the heating rate on different parameters for the biomass of marula

C/min  which  resulted  in  torrefied

biomass with higher mass yield, HHV, energy yield, and energy density.
◦
Some of the parameters had very close values to the 15
C/min case but
◦
C/min implies less energy consumption. The increase in
operating at 10
heating rate promotes dehydration and decarboxylation reactions which
removes  the  volatiles  quickly  in  short  time  thereby  densifying  the
biomass energy. Similar observation was made by few more studies that
separately investigated the effect of heating rate.

C/min,  whereas  it  was  negligible  beyond

◦
to 55% at 50
C/min was observed during torrefaction of microalgae at
300
C and 30 minutes residence time [110]. However, at lower tem-
peratures, 200
C, it was only 1% and 3% respectively, for
the same residence time. Furthermore, the heating rate influenced the
porosity and activity of the char formed by pyrolysis at temperatures
higher than those used in torrefaction [124]. The effect of the heating
rate on char activity and porosity for the torrefaction temperature range
is  not  evident  in  literature,  with  some  exceptions  of  wet  torrefaction
◦
[71]. Hence, for less than 50
C/min, it can be inferred that the effect of
the heating rate, though relatively less than that of the temperature and
residence time, is important and should be considered.

◦

Till now, we discussed the effect of device heating rate, however, this
is the relevant parameter only at lower heating rates and for very fine
particles, otherwise the controlling heating rate depends on the particle
size.

Some studies have specifically addressed the effect of particle size on
torrefaction of different biomass at different conditions. One such study
was carried out by Peng et al. [125] using a TGA and a tubular fixed bed
reactor. They found that for small particles (d < 0.125 mm), the global
reaction rate is not limited by internal diffusion but for large size par-
ticles (d > 0.750 mm), the internal diffusion greatly limits the reaction.
For  TGA data, global  reaction rate was  found to be inversely propor-
tional to the particle size to a power of 0.24, primarily because of the
unique pore formation and enlarging process associated the torrefaction.
For a fixed bed reactor, global reaction rate was 1.29 times the global
reaction  rate  obtained  from  TGA  because  of  better  heat  and  mass
transfer rates [125]. Basu et al. [126] performed a series of experiments
on  a  single  cylindrical  wood  particle  to  show  that  the  mass  yield
increased with increasing the length to diameter ratio. They confirmed
◦
higher heating rates during the drying-preheating stage (20–200
C) for
smaller diameter particles, and an order magnitude lower heating rate
during 200–250
C but following the same trend as shown in Fig. 10a.
The temperature at the core of the biomass increases above that of the
furnace, and is a function of the particle size [126]. This observation was
confirmed  by  the  transient  2-D  particle  model  by  Granados  [127]  on
torrefaction of woody biomass in a heated vertical kiln type reactor. The
study  inferred  that  there  is  an  optimal  particle  size  to  promote  char
formation without having large residence times.

◦

Wang et al. [128] investigated the torrefaction of sawdust particles
of different sizes in a continuous slot-rectangular spouted bed reactor
integrated with cyclone maintained at the same temperature as reactor.
Fig. 10b shows the effect of different particle sizes on mass yield and
HHV  of  the  torrefied  product.  The  mass  yield  shown  in  the  figure  is
based on the total mass of torrefied sawdust collected from a cyclone and
the  mass  remaining  in  the  reactor.  The  net  residence  time  for  the
coarsest particles (d = 1–2 mm) in the reactor was much longer than for
the smaller particles because of longer preheating times [126]. Hence,
the yield of the largest particles was much lower than for the smallest
and intermediate particles. Similar effect was observed on HHV of the
torrefied product though to a lower extent.

Bates and Ghoniem [21] investigated the effect of particle size on the
torrefaction performance using 1-D particle model, and validated it with
the experiments of Basu et al. [126]. Fig. 11 shows the thermal boundary

face, R is the particle radius (m), Qr is the volumetric heat release rate
(W/m3), and k is effective thermal conductivity (W/mK). However, once
the thermal overshoot vanishes, the process no longer depends on the
particle size because of relatively uniform temperature across the par-
ticle, and is controlled purely by kinetics.

For minimum residence time, the rate of heat transfers to and within
the particle should be comparable with the reaction rate. This will bring
the  solid  and  the  surrounding  fluid  to  the  same  temperature  and  the
intrinsic kinetics will be a controlling factor. Biot number (Bi = hL/k)
close to 1 confirms the heat transfer resistances both inside and at the
surface of reactor. The intraparticle temperature gradients exist mainly
because of the internal heat transfer limitations. Other studies have also
reported that for smaller biomass particles (<2 mm), torrefaction is free
from heat and mass transfer limitations [9,33]. For the axial flow of fluid
over the particles that are dropped into an already heated reactor, the
convective external heat transfer coefficient hc  can be estimated using
the Nowak and Stachel correlation

between 4.76 mm and 25.4 mm diameter, the convective external heat
transfer coefficient ranged between 20 and 9 W/m2K, and the effective
radiative heat transfer coefficient ranged between 20 and 40 W/m2K,
depending strongly on reactor and particle surface temperature.

The particle size can have a different effect in different reactors, or in
the  same  reactor  but  at  different  scales.  Due  to  the  high  energy
requirement for grinding raw biomass, large particles are preferred at
commercial  scales.  Biomass  with  larger  particle  size  would  have  less
surface area per unit mass than that with smaller size, thus reducing the
rate of the convective heat transfer [129]. The secondary charring re-
actions  are  higher  in  a  lab-scale  or  pilot  scale  reactor  than  in  the
micro-TGA  experiments,  because  of  the  bigger  particle  size  [130].  In
addition, larger particle sizes of biomass take longer to heat-up due to
the higher heat and mass transfer resistance. Increasing the particle size
results  in  an  increased  yield  of  solid  product,  while  the  yield  of  con-
densable and non-condensable gases decreases. This is further discussed
with respect to characteristic time scales of different processes occurring
in the particle-fluid system in the Section 5.1.

3.4. Residence time

◦

In torrefaction units, the residence time is usually defined as the time
spent by the solid feedstock in the zone between 200 to 300
C, and it
typically  ranges  between  10  and  60  min  on  average.  Compared  to
combustion, gasification, and conventional pyrolysis, the reaction time
for  torrefaction  is  nearly  an  order  of  magnitude  longer  in  order  to
maximize  the  char  formation  [131].  Thus,  larger  reactor  volume  is
required. For a screw type reactor (see Section 6.4), the length and the
rotational speed of the screw, whereas for a conveyer belt reactor, the
belt speed are controlled to provide the required residence time [5,132].
For a moving bed reactor, the residence time is determined by the solid
space velocity, which depends on the reactor height and the rate of solid
removal, usually conducted by a valve or similar device. For any tor-
refaction reactor, the residence time should be sufficient to allow all the
reactions to occur, including the transition between the decomposition
regimes for lignocellulosic components [35]. For example, the transition
period from the depolymerization regime to devolatilization regime for
hemicellulose  is  shorter  than  that  of  lignin  and  cellulose,  due  to  the
higher  reactivity  and  lower  decomposition  temperatures  for  hemicel-
lulose [48].

Fig. 12 shows the effect of the residence time on the solid mass yield
and  HHV  for  different biomass  such as  spruce wood  [133], rice husk
[115], and wood briquettes [119] at different temperatures. For shorter
residence times, as in the case of spruce wood, the effect on the HHV and
mass yield is dominant as compared to that in case of wood briquettes
and rice husk. One of the main reasons for the higher HHV of spruce
wood is the possibility of some of the volatile matter being converted

into  more  fixed  carbon  in  the  solid  product  through  secondary
char-forming reactions. For wood briquettes, with increasing the resi-
dence time, the mass yield dropped by around 15% at lower temperature
and  by  around  10%  at  higher  temperature.  For  rice  husk,  the  HHV
◦
increased with residence time by about 5–8% at 250
C but
much less at 300
C. Strandberg et al. [133] studied the effect of both
residence time and temperature, and reported that the temperature was
the most significant factor, with an effect 1.3 to 1.9 times higher than
residence  time.  This  can  be  explained  using  a  kinetics  model  which
shows Arrhenius dependency on temperature and algebraic dependency
on residence time for a first order reaction as

where  CA  is  concentration  of  feed,  k  is  rate  constant,  A  is  the  pre-
exponential factor, Ea  is the activation energy, R is the molar gas con-
stant, and T is the temperature. The higher residence time may achieve a
higher degree of torrefaction at a given temperature but at the same time
some fixed carbon will start to get consumed if the feedstock stays in the
reactor longer than the time required for relatively quicker devolatili-
zation reactions. In an earlier study, Bridgeman et al. [116] obtained the
mass yields (on a dry ash free basis) as 55.1, 61.5 and 72% for wheat

residence time. They observed the heating value of torrefied product to
rise with increasing the temperature and residence time. The effect of
temperature was dominant due to the loss of moisture and drop in the
oxygen–carbon  or  hydrogen–carbon  ratio  with
the
temperature.

◦

Based on the results of the studies reported in Table S1 (please refer to
supplementary  material)  and  Fig.  12,  the  effect  of  temperature  clearly
appears to be more significant on mass and energy yields compared to
that of the residence time. In the study on torrefaction of loblolly pine
wood [134], at 250
C, as the residence time increases from 0.25 to 4
hours, i.e., by 16 times, the mass and energy yields reduce by about 2%
C  with  4  hours  of
and  18%  respectively.  For  an  experiment  at  250
residence time, the actual reduction in mass and energy yields would be
◦
32% and 19% respectively. But for residence time of 4 hours at 300
C,
the mass and energy yields reduce by about 63% and 41% respectively,
◦
almost double as compared to 250
C. Though research has examined
the residence time and temperature as independent variables, they are
interdependent in practical operation of reactors, in particular, contin-
uous reactors. Additionally, for torrefaction in oxidative environment,
change in  residence  time would have  relatively higher  impact  on the
temperature of reactor than in inert environment.

wood [134].

3.5. Torrefaction medium

Different types of atmospheres have been investigated for biomass
torrefaction. Most often, torrefaction is conducted in an inert environ-
ment (absence of oxygen) to gain higher yields of solid product. Ideally,
to  harness  the  energy  from  burning  of  volatiles  released  during  the
process without oxidation of the solids, oxygen or air is injected into an
external combustor. However, some studies investigated torrefaction in
presence  of  oxygen  at  different  concentrations  as  well  as  in  other
gaseous mediums.

Wang et al. [69] studied the oxidative torrefaction of sawdust and
pellets, and reported shorter torrefaction time and lower external energy
requirement as the primary advantages of this process. They produced
torrefied sawdust and pellets with similar density, higher heating value,
and energy yield as when using nitrogen, and only with slightly reduced
mass yield, hydrophobicity and hardness. These observations confirmed
the possibility of burning the volatiles generated from the torrefaction in
an external combustor and recycle the combustion flue gases (including
CO2, H2O, N2, and small percentage of O2) from the burner for torre-
faction and pre-drying [135]. This would make the torrefaction process
thermally neutral with no need for additional thermal energy input and
the  inert  gases,  leading  to  considerable  savings  in  both  energy  and
operating costs. The conclusion was confirmed by the thermochemical
model  [59]  employed  in  a  1-D  reactor  model  [136].  Another  study
investigated  the  effect  of  combined  oxygen  and  CO2  feeding  against
nitrogen feeding on the torrefaction of biomass with solid product yield
as indicator [137]. The solid yield got reduced by about 2–3% in the O2 -
CO2 case in comparison to the inert case primarily due to the oxidation
reaction consuming some of the solids’ carbon. Also, the liquid and gas
yields  in  oxidative  torrefaction  increased  with  increasing  the  oxygen
concentration.

Chen et al. [138] observed that fibrous biomass is more sensitive to
O2 concentration than the ligneous biomass. An increase in O2 concen-
tration in oxidative torrefaction decreases the solid mass yield and hence
the  energy  yield,  which  is  opposite  to  the  behavior  of  non-oxidative
torrefaction. Fig. 13a shows the effect of oxygen concentration on gas,
liquid, and solid yields for a study on oil palm fiber pellets [139]. On
increasing  the  oxygen  concentration  from  0  to  10%,  solid  char  yield
◦
decreased by about 20% at 275–350
C. A similar observation was made
in another study on torrefaction of different biomass, namely, marula
seeds and blue gum wood [123], as shown in Fig. 13b. In terms of yield
and  energy  content  of  char,  non-oxidative  torrefaction  is  always
preferred to oxidative torrefaction. A series of experimental studies by
Kung et al. [20,70,90,96] carried out torrefaction of different biomass
such as pine shavings, rice husks, and hay straws in the presence of air

(10–20% of the stoichiometric air required for combustion). Though the
mass  yields  of  torrefied  products  were  relatively  lower  than  in  other
studies in inert medium, the HHVs and other properties were similar.
The group proposed to make up for the yield penalty by savings in costs
related to reactor set-up, nitrogen cylinders, external combustor, fuel,
and piping. Also, for a decentralized mobile reactor of small to medium
capacities (0.1–1 ton/h), it is preferred to have a compact reactor design
with  minimal  auxiliary  parts.  A  couple  of  studies  investigated  torre-
faction of bamboo [140] and cotton stalk [141] biomass in ammonia
(NH3) medium with the objective of optimizing the elemental distribu-
tion through nitrogen doping and oxygen removal. In ammonia medium,
the nitrogen content in biomass significantly increased from 0.03% to
7.59% with increasing torrefaction temperature [140].

Uemura et al. [142] investigated the torrefaction of oil palm empty
fruit branches in nitrogen and combustion gas (with 8% oxygen) me-
dium, and analyzed the liquid and gas product compositions. As shown
in  Fig. 14a,  presence  of  oxygen  reduced  both  solid  and  gas  yields  by
4-5%,  and  increased  the  liquid  yield  by  10%.  The  main  reason  was
highlighted as the possible oxidation of hydrogen to water in presence of
oxygen, as reflected in Fig. 14b which shows no significant difference in
organic yield but 8% higher water yield in oxidative medium. In case of
gas  composition,  CO2  yield  did  not  change  considerably  between  the
two different torrefaction mediums, but CO yield dropped from 4% in N2
medium to almost 0.5% in oxidative medium. The study hypothesized
that  the  decarboxylation  reactions  did  not  change  with  the  reaction
◦
C, and CO got decomposed to C and CO2. The possibility
medium at 200
of oxidation of CO was overruled because the decrease in oxygen in gas
phase  was  consistent  with  the  increased  amount  of  water  formed  in
oxidative medium case.

In addition to the torrefaction medium, the flow rate or superficial
velocity of the carrier gas may also affect the process performance. Chen
et al. [18] characterized the solid mass and energy yields for biomass
torrefaction using nitrogen and air at different superficial velocities in a
fixed bed reactor. N2 superficial velocity did not affect the solid yield but
helped  to  move  out  the  volatile  products  during  torrefaction  [137],
suggesting that the torrefaction extent is controlled by heat and mass
transfer within the biomass. However, for the oxidative case, increasing
air velocity decreased the solids yield. The reason is that the additional
heat from the oxidation of volatiles closer to the biomass surface when
using oxygen or air leads to a regime of conversion limited by both heat
and mass transfer in the gas layer close to the surface, resulting in higher
effective heating rates and lower solid yields.

The devolatilization characteristics for a solid fuel such as coal or
biomass are different in different gas environments [143]. The presence
of oxygen in torrefaction medium has a direct impact on the rates and

extent of  reactions, and the  reaction  mechanism. Most  of the  volatile
gases  released  can  be  combusted  in  situ  by  injecting  small  amount  of
oxygen or air in the reactor [70]. The heat generated depends on the
biomass  composition  and  torrefaction  conditions.  If  the  heat  released
due to the combustion of volatiles is sufficient to sustain the torrefaction
reaction, an external combustor may not be required. Additionally, there
would be no need to have volatile gas cleaning/scrubbing step, or to mix
or dilute the volatile gas stream with steam generated from the drying
process as in the TorspydTM column reactor [144]. This will be discussed
later  in  the  section  on  the  energy  management  in  torrefaction  units
(Section 7.1).

3.6. Catalyst

Biomass contains some inorganic matter in addition to its primary
lignocellulosic components. Alkali and alkaline earth metals (AAEMs)
are known to affect the product distribution and the composition during
pyrolysis  even  at  lower  temperatures.  Many  studies  are  available  on
catalytic pyrolysis of biomass but few have studied the effect of catalyst
on biomass torrefaction.

Table 4 summarizes different catalysts used in the different studies
on  biomass  torrefaction.  Metals  such  as  sodium  (Na),  potassium  (K),
calcium (Ca), and manganese (Mn) which are bounded organically in
biomass are known to have positive effects on its reactivity during tor-
refaction [145]. This was confirmed when biomass became less reactive
to  thermal  degradation  after  acid  wash  pretreatment  and  removal  of
these metals [146]: the mass and energy yields increased but the HHV
and the properties of the char were lower. For a specific mass loss, with
the  increase  in  the  amount  of  AAEMs,  the  torrefaction  conditions
became less severe. The salts of AAEMs have been found to modify the
cellulose structure, increasing the thermal reactivity and decreasing the
thermal decomposition temperature [112]. The cellulose molecules also
form intra- and inter-molecular hydrogen bonds with each other, which
create a crystalline micro-fibrils circled by amorphous cellulose [147,
148]. One of the studies investigated the influence Mg-based additives
on torrefaction, finding that MgO-K2CO3 not only produced a low oxy-
gen  content  solid  product  but  also  improved  the  properties  of  the
gaseous and liquid co-products, which could be recovered and utilized
as fuel or chemicals [149]. Sun et al. [150] carried out a detail study to
understand the mechanism of torrefaction of tobacco stalk in the pres-
ence of the NiO and CuO additives. These additives enhanced the rate of
volatile release due to the catalytic action. Solid product yield of cata-
lytic  torrefaction  was  lower  than  that  of  non-catalytic  torrefaction,
which  confirmed  that  the  additives  promoted  the  conversion  of  raw
biomass into bio-oil and non-condensable gases. However, the additives
increased the HHV of the dry/wet torrefied biomass and promoted its
BET surface area and the pore size, in particular, for wet torrefaction.

Most studies reported the effectiveness of catalysts to improve aro-
matic  hydrocarbons  and  reduce  the  acids  in  the  liquid  yield of  torre-
faction. Both the inherent inorganic metallic components in biomass and
the externally added or doped catalysts can influence the torrefaction
reactivity and performance. It is important to understand the contribu-
tion  of  the  catalyst  influence  on  the  performance,  which  is  primarily
governed by the operating conditions. Hence, expanding and enhancing
the knowledge of catalyst in biomass torrefaction in different mediums
will play an important role in the generation of fuels such as biochar,
bio-oil, and torgas. The next section discusses the torrefaction reaction
kinetics and the associated modeling work.

4. Kinetics of torrefaction

The study of reaction kinetics includes the rate of chemical reactions,
the parameters that affect the rates, and the reaction mechanisms. The
estimation of kinetic parameters is important to determine the optimum
process conditions and to achieve the desired yields and properties of
torrefied  product.  Thermal  decomposition  of  biomass  involves  a  very
complex  set  of  reactions,  making  the  formulation  of  accurate  kinetic
models extremely difficult. For biomass torrefaction, knowledge of cel-
lulose,  hemicellulose,  and  lignin  decomposition  in  the  temperature
range of interest, is important to develop a fundamental insight of the
process. Biomass with different fractions of these lignocellulosic com-
ponents can decompose in different way under various conditions.

Torrefaction is  a mild pyrolysis process at  relatively low  tempera-
tures  and  hence,  its  kinetic  models  are  mostly  derived  from  those  of
pyrolysis  processes.  Fig.  15  shows  different  types  of  reaction  mecha-
nisms  used  for  biomass  torrefaction  in  various  kinetic  studies.  These
mechanisms  vary  in  number  of  intermediate  steps,  products,  and  the
reactions which results in different reaction rate constants. Though there
has  been  much  experimental  work  on  torrefaction  during  the  last
decade, relatively less efforts are seen on developing its kinetics. Now,
we discuss the different kinetic models ranging from simple single-step
to detailed multi-step models with underlying reaction mechanisms.

4.1. One-step models

The simplest model for torrefaction of biomass and its components is
one-step single reaction or global model (Fig. 15a), for which the overall
equation for nth order reaction can be written as

where X is the fractional conversion often on dry basis, W is the weight
of the sample at time t, Wi  the initial and Wf  is the final weight of the
sample, and k is the reaction rate constant which is assumed to follow an
Arrhenius law for its dependence on temperature [154].

◦

Repellin  et  al.  [160]  used  this  model  to  accurately  predict  the
anhydrous weight loss of woody biomass (spruce and beech) within the
temperature range of 220–260
C. The one-step model showed a good
agreement  with  the  experimental  data  similar  to  other  models,  and
hence was presented as a first choice for kinetics study because of its
simplicity. Chen and Kuo [161] had employed this model with different
orders  of  reaction  to  predict  the  torrefaction  conversions  of  the  four
components,  namely,  cellulose,  hemicellulose,  lignin,  and  xylan,  in
isothermal conditions. The other single-step models investigated two or
three  parallel  reactions  for  thermal  decomposition  of  biomass.  For
co-torrefaction  of  cellulose,  hemicellulose,  and  lignin,  Chen  and  Kuo
[161]  showed  the  final  kinetics  to  be  the  superposition  of  these  con-
stituents,  without  any  synergistic  effect  of  the  interaction  of  these  or
other biomass constituents such as inorganics and extractives. Carrasco
et al. [155] used the one-step two parallel reactions model (Fig. 15b) of
first order to describe the torrefaction of red oak in a fluidized reactor.
They  reported  one  of  the  highest  values  of  reaction  rate  constant  till
then, which varied from 0.15 to 0.22 min
C. Few
other  studies  employed  one-step  three  parallel  reactions  model  also
known as Shafizadeh-Chin model [156] (Fig. 15c) for the torrefaction of
large  biomass  particles  such  as  wood  log  and  briquettes  [144,162].
However, the model failed to fit the experimental data at temperatures
higher than 260
C, possibly because of the initiation of carbonization
reactions  not  accounted  in  the  model.  Moreover,  the  model  provides
only a small improvement given the complexity involved in considering
an additional reaction step.

Since then, numerous torrefaction studies have employed different

are  reviewed  elsewhere  [9].  The  challenge  with  this  model  is  a  huge
variation  in  the  estimated  values  of  kinetic  parameters  because  of
incorporating  several  physical  and  chemical  factors  into  a  single
expression. Moreover, prediction of product yield may not be accurate
because of the assumption of fixed ratio of pyrolytic products. However,
for a small sample in a TGA test or laboratory scale reactors which allow
only the total final yields to be obtained, a one-step model is the best
alternative to get some kinetic insight of the process.

4.2. Two-step models

Two-step or consecutive-reaction model famously known as Di Blasi-
Lanzetta  model  originally  developed  for  xylan  (hemicellulose)  [157]
uses  five  pseudo  components  including  an  intermediate  product  ac-
counting  for  secondary  devolatilization  reactions.  Pseudo  component
models are known for their simplicity and the quality of obtained results,
which  make  them  a  most  preferred  choice.  As  shown  in  Fig.  15d,
competitive reactions occur between the formation of volatiles (V1 &
V2)  and  solid  products  (B  and  C)  within  each  step.  Among  the  very
earlier  studies  on  torrefaction  kinetics,  Prins  et  al.  [50]  performed  a
detail study to verify whether this two-step mechanism can describe the
weight loss kinetics of wood in the torrefaction temperature range. The
differential equations describing the evolution of these pseudo compo-
nents are given by

proved to be a good set of validation data for several modeling studies.
Table 5 shows the estimated kinetic parameters from some of the studies
that  applied  two-step  model  for  torrefaction  of  different  biomass.
Building  upon  the  investigations  of  Prins  et  al.  [50],  the  distinction
between each step with the corresponding reaction time and mass loss is
appropriately  captured  by  Bates  and  Ghoniem  [167].  Bates  and  Gho-
niem [167] also incorporated a simplified volatile composition model
based on unique chemical mixtures of nine species measured by Prins
[14], to describe the rate of release and composition of volatiles, which
could further predict the solid product composition through elemental
balances. The first, faster step, mainly involving hemicellulose decom-
position with little lignin and cellulose decomposition, forms an inter-
mediate  solid  product  or  char  characterized  by  a  16–30%  mass  loss
within the first 15–60 min at temperatures below 250
C. The second,
slower  step,  mainly  involving  decomposition  of  cellulose  and  some
lignin, and charring of hemicellulose, results in 42–48% mass loss taking
about 120 min at temperatures between 250–300
C [30]. Similar ob-
servations were made by Bach et al. [94] when they found the activation
energy values for the first step to be lower than those in the second step,
and those for the solid formations to be lower than those for the volatile
productions (Table 6).

Several studies have used this model to investigate torrefaction ki-
netics  for  variety  of  biomass  [13,58,94,167,169,174,175],  and  have
confirmed  that  the  model  accurately  predicts  the  solid  mass  loss  and
volatiles evolution during torrefaction. The general observation ranks
the reaction rates from largest to smallest as kB > kV1 > kC > kV2, with
the second step becoming more important as the torrefaction gets more
severe. However, the estimated parameters do not explicitly account for
variations  and  interactions  of  the  lignocellulose  components,  mineral
content, and heating rate effects. As seen from Table 6, the activation
energy varies mostly between the values of 11 kJ/mol to 151 kJ/mol,
and the frequency factor vary between 10 to 1012  among the different
biomass. Hence, the application of this model will need the data for mass
loss kinetics and volatile composition of specific biomass of interests.

Another two-step scheme is the one proposed by Basu et al. [158] for
a  large  biomass  particle  ((Fig.  15e),  which  includes  two  parallel  re-
actions each for both primary and secondary steps. The primary reaction
step involves parallel reactions converting biomass (A) to primary char
(C1) and primary volatiles (V1) containing some gases (G) and heavier
hydrocarbons with lower permeability (C*). The secondary reaction step
involves  cracking  of  C*  to  produce  light  hydrocarbons  or  secondary
gases (V2), and re-polymerization reaction to produce secondary char
(C2). The secondary reactions are assumed to occur within the pores of
solid  matrix  and  the  rate  is  proportional  to  the  concentration  of  the
heavier hydrocarbons in V1, i.e., C*. At any time (t), the residual weight
fraction of solid (W) is given by
W = A + C1 + C∗ + C2

(13)

The estimated kinetic parameters given in Table 6 also account for
the catalytic effects of inorganic constituents because the biomass was
subjected to treatment without any extraction. Higher activation energy
of volatile formation than char formation reflects the higher influence of
temperature variation on volatile formation. At 200
C, char formation
rate  was 1.36 times  of that of  volatile formation,  and, at 300
C,  the
volatile  formation  rate  was  6.66  times  the  char  formation  rate.  This
means that the volatile formation rate may overtake char formation rate
with an increase in temperature. The model and the kinetic parameters
were  used  by  Granados  et  al.  [173]  in  their  2-D  phenomenological
model of the torrefaction process, which will be discussed later in Sec-
tion 5.1.

where kB, kv1, kC, and kv2  represent the Arrhenius kinetic parameters.
The model could accurately describe the weight loss kinetics for torre-
faction of willow biomass between 230–300
C, and also highlight the
time difference in two steps. In a subsequent study [166], they analyzed
the products of torrefaction including the intermediate product, which

A couple of more studies employed two-step reaction models to ac-
count for the effect of alkali metal on torrefaction. Shoulaifar et al. [176]
modeled the impact of organically bonded alkali metals such as potas-
sium on torrefaction using the approach of averaging activation energies
and  obtaining  pre-exponential  factors  dependent  on  concentration  of
potassium.  The  results  were  validated  against  the  experimental  study

[145]  revealing  the  role  of  potassium  in  increased  production  of  CO,
CO2, and water above 250  kJ/mol°C. A recent study proposed the po-
tassium responsive numerical path (PRNP) to characterize the kinetic
behaviour  of  different  biomass  impregnated  with  K2CO3  [177].  The
model is based on three-stage approach of finding global kinetics from
individual and group temperatures [178] as well as the unified activa-
tion energies (UAE) approach similar to one proposed in [176]. PRNP
could accurately predict solid yield and showed a linear correlation with
potassium content, reaction rate, and pre-exponential factors.

4.3. Multi-step models

The commonly used multi-step detailed models for torrefaction ki-
netics are the Rousset model [101], three consecutive reaction model

[159],  and  the  Ranzi  model  [179].  The  Rousset  model  [101,160]  as-
sumes thermal decomposition of wood as a superposition of the thermal
decomposition of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin as per their pro-
portion,  with  each  of  them  following  different  reaction  mechanisms.
Cellulose decomposition follows the modified Broido–Shafizadeh model
[180],  hemicellulose  decomposition  follows  the  Di  Blasi–Lanzetta
model, and lignin decomposition follows the single-step model. Table 7
shows the reactions and kinetic parameters for Rousset’s model applied
for different biomass.

The differential equations for each of the reactant and product spe-
cies associated with main lignocellulosic components can be written as

neglected the gas phase reactions at lower temperatures of torrefaction,
and reduced the final scheme to 13 reactions. They included the pres-
ence  of  secondary  char  formation  reactions,  preference  of  the  frag-
mentation  pathway  over  sugar  formation  for  both  cellulose  and
hemicellulose,  and  the  presence  of  acetyl  groups  linked  to  xylan  in
typical hemicelluloses. The group extended their work to general cate-
gories of hardwood and softwood with a known range of lignocellulosic
composition, and included the release of acetic acid from hemicellulose
in the model [130]. Though the model could predict solid mass yield and
the  main  volatile  groups,  it  could  not  be  extended  to  other  biomass
species or heating conditions because of its complexity.

4.4. Other models

In  addition  to  the  above  discussed  models,  some  studies  have
employed  two-pseudocomponent  two  parallel  reactions  model  [165].
However,  both  the  models  considered  overall  reaction  rate  as  simple
linear combination of the individual partial reactions without any syn-
ergistic interaction. The two pseudo components were labelled as fast
reaction  group  (hemicellulose),  and  medium  or  slow  reaction  group
(cellulose plus lignin) [165].

Assuming above two reactions to be of first order reactions, the re-

sidual weight fraction of biomass (WTGA) can be given by

When Repellin et al. [160] applied this model for spruce and beech
biomass, and tried to adjust the nine parameters (kC1, kC2, kT, kC3, kB,
kV3, kV4, fL, fC), they obtained negative values for fL and kV4, which made
them  infer  the  non-occurrence  of  these  reactions.  In  comparison  to
Rousset’s parameters, mainly the hemicellulose decomposition param-
eters  varied  significantly,  again  confirming  the  higher  breakdown  of
hemicellulose than lignin or cellulose during torrefaction. However, the
model predicted higher reactivity for spruce in contrast to the experi-
mental  observation  which  showed  higher  reactivity  for  spruce.  This
questions the hypothesis of superposition and the selected mechanisms
for lignocellulosic components, further implying the possible influence
of the interaction and other constituents such as inorganics on the tor-
refaction kinetics.

The  three  consecutive  reaction  model  (Fig.  15f)  was  proposed  by
Klinger et al. [159] to examine the gas-phase kinetics of torrefaction,
based on the evolution of six products: water, carbon monoxide, carbon
dioxide, acetic acid, formic acid, and furfural. The respective activation
energies and pre-exponential factors of three reactions were 105, 127,
(cid:0) 1. They
and 172 kJ/mol, and 3.32 × 109, 1.43 × 1011, and 20.8 min
applied this model to further predict the solid properties over the tor-
refaction mass loss up to 30% mainly due to hemicellulose degradation,
and  believed  it  to  cover  the  total  mass  loss  during  torrefaction  after
adding more reaction stages and additional chemical species [181].

A  detailed  chemical kinetic  scheme  originally  developed  by  Ranzi
et al. [179] to model biomass pyrolysis, is another multi-step model that
has been applied to torrefaction by few studies after slight modifications
[182,183]. The model is based on the description of chemical reactions
occurring during treatment and allows simultaneous prediction of solid
mass loss and produced volatile composition. Anca-Couce et al. [183]

where k is a rate constant following Arrhenius law, and C1 and C2 are the
concentrations  of  fast  reaction  group  and  medium  reaction  group,
respectively.

The change in reaction medium may affect the torrefaction kinetics
by additional reactions taking place in the presence of oxygen. Several
studies suggested that an increase in O2 concentration results in a higher
decomposition rate of biomass, leading to shortened torrefaction time or
lowered torrefaction temperature to achieve a targeted weight loss [69,
184,185]. In their study on torrefaction of oil palm empty fruit bunches
in  presence  of  oxygen,  Uemura  et  al.  [186]  identified  two  parallel
pathways, namely, hemicellulose decomposition representing the orig-
inal torrefaction reaction, and the biomass oxidation. Wang et al. [69]
investigated  the  torrefaction  of  pine  particles  with  different  oxygen
concentrations  in  the  carrier  gas,  and  modified  the  above  mentioned
two-component kinetic model to include the effect of oxygen according
to [186] as

where yO2  is the oxygen mole fraction, k1 and k2 are the torrefaction rate
constants following Arrhenius law, kO1  and kO2  are the oxidation rate
constants following Arrhenius law, and n1 and n2 are the oxygen reaction
orders of the fast reaction group and medium reaction group, respec-
tively. As shown in Table 8, activation energy (E) values of fast reaction
group  are  smaller  than  medium  reaction  group  in  both  inert  and
oxidative mediums. Though the overall oxidation reaction is found to be
less sensitive to the temperature than torrefaction reaction, higher value
of n2 indicates the oxidation of hemicellulose to be more sensitive to the
oxygen  concentration.  Alvarez  et  al.  [187]  estimated  the  kinetics  for
oxidative  and  non-oxidative  torrefaction  of  a  pine  wood,  but  did  not
observe significant differences in the kinetic parameters. However, they
used the one-step single reaction model with reaction order close to 2,
unlike Wang et al. [69].

focused mainly on model fitting, and hence future work should look at
different approaches to validate reliability and consistency of the kinetic
information including the effect of inorganic content and the interaction
of lignocellulosic components.

5. Modeling studies on torrefaction

Although kinetics of torrefaction is important to understand the ef-
fects of operating conditions on the rates and yields of different feed-
stocks,  pure  kinetics  seldom  limits  the  rate  of  conversion  of  biomass
particles in a reactor. Moreover, the particles in a reactor move, mix, and
react throughout a large volume, where the gas-solid contact is far from
ideal. The biomass particles may react at different rates based on their
individual  size  and  composition,  and  the  local  temperature.  This
significantly  influences  the  performance  of  the  reactor  as  well  as  the
actual yields and composition of the main species. Therefore, particle
and reactor scale models are necessary for process design, operational
optimization, and control of industrial torrefaction reactors. This section
discusses the models at particle scale followed by the models for various
types of reactors and process arrangements used in biomass torrefaction
technology.

5.1. Particle models

where X is the conversion, x is the mass proportion, and a (=0.004), b
(=1.5), and c (=1.3), are the constants associated with hemicellulose,
cellulose and lignin, respectively. However, the model still resulted in
the error levels of 10% for yellow poplar and 7% for sugarcane bagasse.
A recent study used iso-conversional model fitting and integral model-
free  methods  to  estimate  kinetic  parameters  for  torrefaction  of  oil
palm frond pellets [189]. The model included the effect of heating rate
(β  = dT/dt),  and  replaced  the  term  (-Ea/RT)  by  p(x)  which  was
approximated by model-free method, Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS),
and model fitting method, Coats-Redfern (CR). The KAS and CR models
estimated  the  activation  energy  values  of  239.03  kJ/mol  and  109.28
kJ/mol, thereby indicating the CR model to be more reliable [188].

Considering  the  distributed  nature  of  the  reactions  across  the
biomass  structure,  Sarvaramini  et  al.  [190]  evaluated  the  distributed
activation energy model (DAEM) for investigating torrefaction kinetics
for hardwood and pure biomass components. DAEM assumes an infinite
number  of  irreversible  nth-order  parallel  reactions  with  differences  in
their  activation  energies  represented  by  a  distribution  function.  The
model  when  combined  with  three-parameter  log-normal  distribution
function,  could  reliably  predict  the  experimental  volatile  release  of
xylan and lignin with time but not the cellulose. However, the possibility
of coupling DAEM with other models and methods make it a promising
approach to explore in future for various biomass.

From all the reaction mechanisms and kinetic modeling efforts dis-
cussed, a conclusion applied to torrefaction is clear: the most important
reaction is the fast decomposition of highly reactive hemicellulose, and
it should go to completion. The later stages involving cellulose decom-
position  and  secondary  charring  reactions  of  hemicellulose  reaction
products, are slower and may lead to uneconomically large equipment.
Though the one-step models have been widely used for their simplicity,
multi-step models accounting for more reactions and species along with
synergistic  interaction  effect  of  biomass  components  may  provide  a
better  fundamental  insight.  Ongoing  research  on  exploring  more
detailed  reaction  mechanism  and  kinetics  for  torrefaction  of  multiple
feedstock explains the lack of a satisfactory solid devolatilization model
under the reaction conditions of interest. Almost all discussed kinetic
models  studied  the  biomass  degradation  at  isothermal  conditions  at
different  heating  rates.  However,  for  low  heating  rates,  weight  loss
during heating period cannot be neglected, and for high heating rates,
heat  transfer  limitations  may  affect  the  results.  There  is  a  need  to
develop kinetic models coupled with heat and mass transfer effects for

The  chemical  kinetics  and  physical  processes  like  heat  and  mass
transfer that governs the biomass torrefaction can be explained using
particle models. Fig. 16 shows a simple representative schematic of the
processes occurring at single particle level during torrefaction. When a
biomass particle is subjected to torrefaction (200–300 °C), heat transfer
may  take  place  by  conduction,  convection,  and  radiation  [21,158].
Depending on the temperature of the reacting environment, the particle
gets  heated  by  external  convection  and  radiation  in  different  pro-
portions.  Then  there  is  a  transient  heat  conduction  and  internal  pore
convection  within  the  particle  [191].  The  solid  conducts  heat  from
surface  towards  inner  core  producing  drying  and  torrefaction  fronts,
which propagate with a velocity proportional to the net heat flux. At the

onset  of  torrefaction  (200

inward moving drying front. As the temperature reaches 250
exothermic  reactions  start,  but  are  negligible  in  comparison  to  endo-
thermic  ones  till  300
C  [14,21].  As  the  biomass  particles  undergo  a

complex set of reactions in addition to different interacting mass and
heat  transfer  phenomena  for  small  and  large  particles,  it  becomes
important to identify the more relevant processes before formulating a
particle level model.

The TGA crucible or small laboratory-scale apparatus typically use
fine particles whereas industrial reactors use coarse particles. Table 9
shows  the  characteristic  time  scales  of  different  processes  occurring
during  torrefaction,  which  will  help  to  identify  the  rate  controlling
mechanisms  for  smaller  and  bigger  particles.  The  transfer  resistances
may be neglected for fine particles (microscale) as torrefaction is mostly
governed by kinetics. But for coarser or thicker particles (macroscale), a
strong interaction exists between kinetics and transfer phenomena at the
level of both single particle and the reaction environment. For instance,
the ratio of the heat transfer resistances inside a body and at the surface
of a body is given by Biot number, which typically varies between 0.4–4
for a respective particle diameter of 2–20 mm. At higher Biot numbers
(>1), the gradients of temperature and species concentration across the
particle becomes significant. The detailed parametric explanation and
the conclusions of characteristic time scales are mentioned in [21]. The
particle  models  were developed  primarily for  torrefaction, with  some
models  including  a  separate  drying  stage.  Now,  we  discuss  the  1-D
particle  models  followed  by  2-D  and  more  complex  particle  level
models for biomass torrefaction.

Felfi et al. [162] proposed a 1-D phenomenological transient model
for torrefaction of wet wood log and briquette heated at temperatures
230–300  °C  to  estimate  minimum  time  of  torrefaction,  energy  con-
sumption  and  the  mass  yield.  The  model  used  the  kinetics  of
Shafizadeh-Chin [156] and assumed the generated volatiles and steam
to  be  in  thermal  equilibrium  with  the  solid,  and  neglected  geometric
changes in the solid, pressure gradients, and diffusive transport. Model
results  predicted  an  optimum  residence  time  for  wood  logs  with  a
relatively large diameter (> 50 mm). As torrefaction propagates into the
solid, the char thickness increases, insulating the core (the effective heat
conductivity decreases) and the temperature rise tends to flatten, mak-
ing  it difficult  to homogenize  the temperature profiles  inside the  log.
Ratte et al. [193] proposed a model for thermal degradation of spherical
wood particle based on the volume-averaging concept and three parallel
reactions  scheme  of  Shafizadeh-Chin  [156].  The  volume-averaging
helps  to  derive  local  volume-average  equations  which  are  valid
throughout the homogenous porous medium. The model considered a
wood  particle  as  a  heterogeneous  material  composed  of  fives  phases:
dried wood phase, char phase, bound water phase, liquid water phase
and  gas  phase,  at  a  smaller  scale  (Fig.  17).  It  predicts  intra-particle
profiles  for  several  variables  such  as  temperature,  moisture  content,
and  concentration  of  wood.  The  model  reproduces  more  physical

phenomena than Felfi et al. [162], such as the temperature distribution
inside  the  particle.  The  model  is  able  to  describe  the  chemical  and
physical processes occurring in the torrefaction column at the particle
level and in the surrounding gas. It also predicts the gas temperature
profiles inside the column.

Basu  et  al.  [158]  proposed  a  1-D  model  including  drying,  heat
transfer  resistances and shrinkage  of cylindrical wood particle  during
torrefaction,  based  on  the  two-step  kinetic  scheme  involving  primary
and secondary char formations (Fig. 15e). While the solid mass loss ki-
netics  of  the  first  stage  were  separately  fitted  under  TGA  conditions,
multiple kinetic and thermochemical parameters were tuned during the
development of the particle scale model including the heat of reaction.
For smaller particles, the model did not see any effect of particle size on
residual char because of lower heat transfer resistances. However, for
bigger  particles,  the  fractional  char  residue  increased  with  increasing
particle size for lower residence times (<30 min). The model results also
found  the  average  particle  temperatures  10–15
C  above  the  reactor
temperature. Another study reported a 1-D transient model for thermal
degradation of wood particle focusing mainly on primary char forma-
tion, but neglected convective heat transfer between the solid and the
volatiles generated inside the particle [194].

Among these models, none would provide validation for the intra-
particle  temperature  profile,  free  from tunable  parameters,  that  gives
information on the energy content of the solid product. For larger par-
ticles (d > 4 mm), which are mostly preferred in industrial applications,
significantly more complex internal heat and mass transfer phenomena
occur. Non-uniform heat release from exothermic reactions can further
aggravate  the  temperature  heterogeneity,  occasionally  resulting  in
thermal  runaway  [195]. The single  particle  model proposed  by  Bates
and  Ghoniem [21] based  on the kinetic and  thermochemistry models
proposed  in  their  earlier  works  [59,167]  addressed  these  needs  by
describing the time dependent heat and mass transfer within the parti-
cle, and the inhomogeneous thermal and physical properties. The model
used the first order two-step reaction mechanism [157] experimentally
validated by Prins et al. [50].

torrefied biomass because of the higher energy content and the lower

rate models for mass loss kinetics mechanisms and thermochemical data
are needed at higher temperatures up to 350

Some  studies  investigated  2-D  models  to  represent  torrefaction  of
biomass particles, particularly bigger particles. Turner et al. [197] used
the 2-D version of a drying code “TransPore” [198] to simulate heat and
mass transfer phenomena during torrefaction of beech (Fagus sylvatica)
wood, and compared the predicted temperature profiles to experimental
results of a large beech board. They noted a significant effect of reaction

enthalpy term on the temperature profiles, however due to the lack of
available  data,  the  reaction  enthalpy  of  hemicellulose  decomposition
was used as a tuning parameter. The model assumed biomass decom-
position kinetics to be governed by the decomposition of its individual
components, and did not consider the secondary char formation from
the volatiles. Perr ́e et al. [195] later extended this work to propose a
dual-scale model to investigate the effect of the stack configuration on
the heat treatment of the beech boards at industrial level. As shown in
Fig. 18a, the particle model involved a two-way coupling between the
heat and mass transfer (bound water, free water, vapor water, volatiles
matter) and chemical mechanisms, including the thermal activation of
the chemical reactions, together with the treatment of heat sources (or
sinks)  and  the  production  of  volatiles.  The  model  proposed  different
measures to lower the thermal runaway during torrefaction operation
such as increasing the airflow velocity or/and the sticker thickness, and
by reversing the gas flow.

Granados et al. [173] developed a transient 2-D model for a biomass
particle in an heated vertical kiln type reactor, using the kinetic scheme
(Fig.  17e)  and  the  volume-average  method.  Fig.  18b  shows  the  kiln
reactor  system  and  the  energy  transfer  between  biomass  particle  and
external system, with focus on biomass particle composition with four
components at any instant during the mid of the process. None of the
earlier models had treated these four components simultaneously. The
model was validated against the experimental data of Basu et al. [126]
and van der Stelt [58], and could predict the temperature, mass loss,
internal pressure in the biomass particle, yield/loss of each phase, and
the speed of the gas phase while exiting the particle. Around 20 mm was
found to be the optimal particle size to promote char formation without

having large residence times. Also, the model could obtain the optimum
values of temperature and residence time for maximum conversion of
biomass  for  any  particle  size.  Thus,  the  model  gave  some  additional
insights with better fit to the experimental data than the 1-D model of
Bates and Ghoniem, though at the expense of relatively complex kinetics
and more rigorous computations. There is no doubt that this model can
provide valuable information in optimizing the torrefaction process for a
given geometry and properties of the biomass.

In addition to 1-D and 2-D models, few more efforts were made to
model torrefaction of biomass particles. Kadem et al. [199] developed a
transient 3-D set of equations with Navier–Stokes equation for the fluid
and  Luikov  model  for  the  porous  solid,  to  model  the  heat  treatment
◦
(150–250
C) of wood with focus on heat and moisture transfer (drying)
processes.  The  model  assumed  laminar  flow  in  porous  medium,  and
neglected  particle shrinkage and thermal decomposition kinetics. The
model could predict the temperature and moisture distributions of the
wood during the entire process, and also investigate the effect of heating
rate. Some studies employed empirical regressions to predict the product
properties as a function of mass loss [81], but the validity of such ana-
lyses  is  unknown  beyond  the  thermal  conditions  under  which  it  was
tested. Moreover, these models could not predict the energy content of
the liberated volatiles or the reaction thermochemistry. Table S2 (please
refer to supplementary material) lists some of the particle modeling studies
on  torrefaction  of  different  biomass  in  different  operating  conditions
reported in literature.

5.2. Reactor models

The kinetic models for biomass torrefaction generally give a zero-
dimensional  description  of  process  at  microscale  particles.  However,
the  particle  models  describe  the  heat  and  mass  transport interactions
along with kinetics, and hence can be used for reactor modelling after
including additional hydrodynamic considerations in the reactor. Most
of  the  reactor  models  proposed  for  biomass  torrefaction  are  1-D
phenomenological models, with few CFD simulated 3-D models.

Park et al. [15] developed a 1-D reactor model that considered the
practical  thermal  conditions  for  biomass  torrefaction,  based  on  Bates
and Ghoniem’s particle kinetic and thermochemistry models [167,59].
They considered the TORSPYD reactor geometry with the column con-
taining  wood  chip  particles  undergoing  torrefaction  and  a  convective
gas  surrounding  the  particle  bed  (Fig.  19a).  The  model  included  the
practical  operating  conditions  such  as  recycled  gas  temperature  and
flow rate, in addition to typical process parameters. For a specified en-
ergy  yield,  the  combination  of  lower  flowrate  of  high  temperature

recycled gas, and shorter residence time produced the torrefied biomass
with better HHV and grindability. Earlier, Ratte et al. [144] also pro-
posed a mixed 1-D model for the design and optimization of a contin-
uous TORSPYD reactor developed by ‘Thermya’ France, based on their
previous particle model [193]. Though the spherical particles inside the
reactor were modeled in radial and axial directions, the gas phase and
the overall reactor equations were modeled only in axial direction. The
model  assumes  both  solid  and  gas  phases  in  the  plug  flow  along  the
height of the reactor. Since the residence time of the particles is much
higher than the gas in the reactor, they considered solid bed as a fixed
bed,  and  estimated  the  mass  and  heat  transfer  coefficients  using
dimensionless  numbers  for  fixed  bed.  Only  7%  of  the  height  of  the
reactor  encountered  thermal  degradation  reactions,  with  rest  of  the
reactor having only drying and condensation processes. The important
parameters to monitor for reactor operations were energy flowrate at the
bottom of the column and moisture content of fresh feed.

Granados  [99,127]  developed  a  1-D  model  for  torrefaction  in  a
two-stage  rotary  reactor  (dryer  and  torrefaction  unit)  with  three
distinguishable  phases:  gas  phase  generated  by  devolatilization  of
biomass, a solid phase located at the bottom forming a bed, and a second
solid  phase  generated  by  solid  particles  that  fall  from  longitudinal
reactor flights or lifters. Having a separate dryer before torrefaction unit
results  in  the  recovery  of  moisture-free  volatiles  in  the  second  step,
making  it  easy  to  burn  volatiles  and  make  an  auto-thermal  process.
Fig. 19b shows the solid flow and heat transfer between rotating and
fixed reactor walls of the reactor. Though conduction is the dominant
heat  transfer  mode,  additional  energy  transfer  occurs  by  convection
between biomass falling from the flights and gas phase, and by radiation
between biomass and reactor walls. The model inferred that the dryer
could operate at shorter residence times or reduced thermal load, and
identified the optimum length of torrefaction reactor for a given set of
conditions.  The  model  could  predict  reactor  performance  under
different operating conditions, for different reactor dimensions, and may
be applied for different biomass after changing kinetic parameters.

For an experimentally investigated moving-bed torrefaction reactor
operating under oxygen-lean conditions [70], Kung and Ghoniem [136]
developed a 1-D reactor model (Fig. 20) to describe the operation of the
reactor,  and  interrogate  the  design  concept  further  under  different
scaling  conditions.  From  the  expected  mass  yield  of  the  torrefied
biomass  at  the  same  torrefaction  severity,  it  was  concluded  that  the
reactor performance improves at larger scale because of the decrease in
the  reactor  wall  heat  loss.  The  model  captures  many  details  of  the
reactor set-up with reasonable fidelity, but has several simplifying as-
sumptions. More recently, a 1-D model was developed to simulate the

Fig. 19. (a) Scheme of commercial moving bed torrefaction reactor [15]; (b) Mass and energy transfer between considered phases of rotary drum torrefaction unit in
a differential element (qr, qh, and qc  represent heat transfer by radiation, convection, and conduction respectively) [127].

Lagrangian  approaches  for  multi-phase  CFD  modelling  of  a  pyrolysis
process are available elsewhere [203]. The discussed studies show that
CFD simulations can be used for modeling torrefaction reactors provided
enough experimental data are available for the systems.

Different reactor designs need a different set of models to explain the
overall torrefaction process performance. 1-D models seem to be more
promising for fixed or moving bed and rotary drum reactors for their
simplicity and explanation. Many studies used 1-D particle model and
two-step reaction mechanism, while few studies used 2-D particle model
and multi-step reaction schemes to give slightly better predictions. The
challenges for these reactor models would be incorporating the syner-
gistic  effect  of  interaction  of  biomass  constituents,  and  the  effect  of
heating  rate  which  will  get  more  complex  for  reactors  operating  in
partially oxidative medium. CFD models may be employed for fluidized
bed  reactors  as  these  reactors  have  excellent  heat  and  mass  transfer
characteristics  and  uniform  product  distribution.  The  challenges  with
these  models  would  be  to  account  for  maximum  number  of  reacting
particles,  having  enough  experimental  data  for  validation,  and  the
computational time for convergence.

Since most of the torrefaction models are derived from conventional
pyrolysis  models,  several  challenges  with  these  models  are  similar  to
those  for  pyrolysis.  Biomass  has  a  complex  chemical  composition
(organic,  inorganic)  and  physical  structure  (microporous)  having  a
direct impact on kinetics, and heat and mass transfer within the particles
during conversion process However, majority kinetic models typically
base their reactions only around lignocellulosic components, and par-
ticle models generally employ simplified geometries such as spheres and
cylinders  neglecting  the  intraparticle  microstructure.  The  challenges
such as complexity of devolatilization reactions in terms of mechanism
and kinetics, and morphological evolution of biomass particles in tor-
refaction conditions will require great efforts to solve in the near future.
Any  improvement  at  kinetics  and  particle  level  models  will  not  only
improve  the  process  insight  but  also  contribute  to  developing  better
reactor models.

5.3. Process simulation models

◦

The techno-economic evaluation of a torrefaction unit or a pilot plant
requires  information  such  as  material  and  energy  balances  for  each
process  equipment  and  stream,  raw  material  and  utilities,  mass  and
energy recycled or reused, and losses to the surroundings. As the tor-
C,  the  volatiles
refaction  temperature  increases  from  200  to  300
released increases which means that there is some energy that can be
captured and utilized. Appropriate process or heat integration for energy
management of a standalone torrefaction plant or integrated set-up can
reduce the energy cost of the plant. The plants, at different scales, will
have  direct  impact  on  the  equipment  sizing  and  parameters  thereby
changing the energy management of the process. For systems at different
scales, process simulation is an efficient tool along with kinetic, particle,
and reactor models for overall assessment. A process simulation model
has  the  potential  to  estimate  the  material  and  energy  balances,  effi-
ciency  of  the  system,  enabling  process  optimization  with  minimizing
energy  consumption  and  subsequent  costs.  It  can  be  a  useful  tool  to
provide data for subsequent life cycle analysis, hazard and operability
(HAZOP)  analysis,  and  cost-benefit  analysis  studies.  There  have  been
some attempts on modeling of torrefaction process using process simu-
lation software.

Bergman et al. [48] investigated the mass and energy balances for
the torrefaction of a hardwood (willow) and a softwood (pine), respec-
tively, at various temperatures and different scenarios using Aspen Plus.
None  of  the  drying  and  torrefaction  scenarios  of  wood  with  initial
moisture content of 50%, within the temperature range of 250–300
C
and residence time of 7.5–30 min was auto-thermal. Auxiliary fuels such
as natural gas were utilized along with torgas to provide the required
energy for the system. Nikolopoulos et al. [204] combined an Aspen Plus
model  and  chemical  kinetics  to  study  wheat  straw  torrefaction  in  a

operation of the vertical shaft torrefaction reactor with direct heating
and recirculation of the heat carrier which consisted of exhaust gases
from the gas piston unit and torrefaction volatile products [200]. The
degree of mass losses during torrefaction was shown to depend not only
on the temperature but also on mass flow rate of the heat carrier at the
reactor inlet. Table S3 (please refer to supplementary material) shows the
summary  of  some  of  the  reactor  modeling  studies  on  biomass  torre-
faction reported in literature.

Few  studies  employed  3-D  models  for  torrefaction  reactor  using
numerical simulations or CFD simulations. Patuzzi et al. [17] developed
a 3-D thermochemical and fluid dynamic model based on a finite volume
method, using two-step kinetic scheme [50]. The model was validated
with  experiments on  bench scale  batch  reactor for reed biomass.  The

The model hypothesized no significant change in the biomass sample
volume, but accounted for variations in the porosity and the density. The
numerical model was solved using Ansys FLUENT, and could estimate
the velocity profiles and temperature distribution inside the oven and
the reactor at different time steps. Another study [201] simulated tor-
refaction in a screw reactor using a comprehensive CFD-model reported
for slow pyrolysis [202] and tested two different kinetic schemes orig-
inally proposed for pyrolysis. The model implemented the Euler-Euler
approach to represent a multiphase system with a granular flow, and

experimental  data.  The  details  on  commonly  used  Eulerian  and

two parts, torrefaction and solids cooling, and reactions for each part
was  modeled  as  stoichiometric  (RSTOIC)  reactor.  Hot  mineral  oil
entering  the  system  at  350

provide heat for the torrefaction process. They also compared the per-
formance of single and double batch torrefaction reactors as shown in
Table 10. Though the two staged torrefaction in the case where second
stage temperature is lower than the first stage achieved higher energy
recovery while on the other hand, one has to invest in a more complex
expensive apparatus.

Another study [205] carried out energy and exergy analyses for the
torrefaction of pine and eucalyptus species at 250
C, and
found the volatiles from eucalyptus having a higher heating value than
from  pine.  The  is  because  hardwoods  like  eucalyptus  releases  mainly
acetic acid (14.6 MJ/kg) and water on torrefaction, while softwoods like
pine releases mostly formic acid (5.55 MJ/kg). Bach et al. [206] simu-
lated an entire process of torrefaction of birch branches in Aspen Plus
using kinetics from different studies [50,94,167] and obtained the dis-
tributions  of  main  product  and  co-products.  Drying  accounted  for
76–80% of the total heat demand in the process. But the details such as
dryer type, kinetics of drying, the moisture and the temperature profiles
for  dryer  were  not  scrutinized.  Recently,  Maryam  and  Mani  [207]
simulated integrated biomass torrefaction and pelletization (iBTP) plant
to determine equipment size and design parameters based on mass and
energy balances, using Aspen Plus (Fig. 21). Pre-defined reactor modules
were used to model a rotary kiln torrefaction reactor and the primary
thermal  and electrical energy requirements were estimated.  The total
thermal  energy  consumption  for  the  production  of  torrefied  pellets
ranged from 5.2 to 14.1 MJ/kg with the torgas energy contributions of
30–90% for the torrefaction temperature range of 250–290

The discussion on modeling studies in torrefaction highlights that for
an  optimal  reactor  or  process  design,  a  more  detail  accounting  of
fundamental  thermochemistry,  chemical  kinetics,  and  flow  dynamics,
especially  for  oxidative  torrefaction  is  required.  This  emphasizes  the
need for more experiments on variety of biomass in different types of
reactors at different scales. A higher-fidelity model representation of the
reactor  behaviors  can  be  achieved  both  by  experimentally  measuring
several physical and chemical parameters as well as by developing the
mathematical description for these parameters and processes. Though
extensive  efforts  have  been  made  on  particle  level  models  and  some
efforts have been made on the reactor level models for torrefaction, a
complete model for different reactors does not yet exist. Process simu-
lation studies have provided overall insight of the plant but most of them
have been conducted on torrefaction in inert medium with heat being
supplied  externally  either  through  torgas  or  other  fuel.  The  energy
management for the process may change significantly for torrefaction in
oxidative medium as it may even remove the need for external fuel at
appropriate operating conditions.

sections  include  pretreatment,  torrefaction,  and  post-treatment.  The
pretreatment processes such as washing, drying, densifying, screening,
elemental impregnation, leaching, etc. prepares the biomass feedstock
for the torrefaction process. After the torrefaction is completed, the post-
treatment processes such as cooling, densification, screening, grinding,
etc. are applied to enhance the fuel properties and assist in transport,
handling, and storage. More details on pretreatment and post-treatment
methods are available in a recently published review [43]. The torre-
faction reactor is the heart of the process incurring most of the capital
cost, yet there is no best universal reactor design because of which it is
important  to  properly  select  the  reactor  for  a  specific  feedstock  and
application.

In this section, we explore some of the existing torrefaction reactor
technologies. The manner in which the biomass is conveyed through the
reactor, the design, and heat transfer mechanism are the primary dis-
tinguishing features of the reactors. It is important to develop the reactor
models for each of these reactors for optimizing the design. The basic
functional requirements of a torrefaction reactor are heating the biomass
up  to  a  target  temperature  and  conveying  the  biomass  continuously.
Batch torrefaction have limited scale-up opportunities, and hence, most
of the pilot and commercial units under development prefer continuous
reactor. The other systematic way of classifying the torrefaction reactors
is distinguishing between directly-heated and indirectly-heated reactors
[16].  In  directly  heated  reactors,  biomass  is  heated  by  direct  contact
with the heating media that must be either completely free of oxygen or
with limited amount of oxygen. The heating media could be hot gas, hot
solids,  superheated  steam  or  electromagnetic  radiation.  In  indirectly
heated reactors, the heat carrying medium does not contact the biomass
but the heat is exchanged across the walls. Thus, it is relatively easy here
to avoid presence of oxygen in the reactor and therefore any combustion
during torrefaction. The transfer of heat to biomass particles could take
place through one or more of the means such as gas-particle convection,
wall-particle  conduction,  electromagnetic  radiation,  particle-particle
heat transfer, and liquid-particle heat transfer [28].

There  have  been  very  few  reports  and  studies  on  comparison  of
different  types  of  reactors  for  the  torrefaction  process.  A  report  by
Bergman et al. [48] was the first to compare the estimated net efficiency
of  torrefaction  for  three  types  of  reactors;  indirectly  heated  screw,
directly  heated  rotating  screw  and  moving  bed  for  a  set  of  assumed
design parameters. The next systematic study on comparison of different
reactor designs was published by Dhungana et al. [16] which stated that
the convective and fluidized bed reactors have direct heating, rotating
drum  reactor  has  indirect  heating  while  microwave  has  a  volumetric
heating (a  subgroup of direct  heating) mechanism. Fig. 22  shows the
effect of different reactor types on mass and energy yield for torrefaction
of poplar wood cylindrical particle (25 mm diameter and 64 mm height)
◦
at 250
C, 60 min [16]. Both the mass and energy yields for rotary drum
and microwave reactor are significantly lower than the convective and
fluidized reactors. Energy yield is important when torrefaction is carried
out at the point of use or at destination following transportation. Energy
density  is  important  when  torrefaction  is  carried  out  at  the  biomass
collection point, i.e., before transportation occurs. The study found that
indirectly-heated  reactors  are  superior  if  energy  density  is  important
whereas directly-heated reactors are superior if energy yield is impor-
tant.  Since  then,  there  have  been  few  reports  [36,37,132]  and  some
reviews  [41,42]  that  described  the  different  types  of  torrefaction  re-
actors  with  their  advantages  and  limitations.  This  section  discusses
several common types of continuous reactor designs that can satisfy the
above criteria.

6.1. Moving bed

This is a vertically oriented reactor where a packed bed of biomass
moves  downwards,  driven  by  gravity.  At  the  base  of  the  reactor,  a
mechanism (e.g., auger, conveyor, inclined slope) continuously removes
the  torrefied  biomass  from  the  reactor.  The  temperature  gradient  is

S.K. Thengane et al.

specific  heat  capacity.  Hot  gases  are  injected  directly  into  the  bed  of
solid  particles  at  a  much  higher  velocity  (around  1  m/s)  than  in  the
moving bed design, such that the solid particles (both biomass and the
carrier solid) are in fluidized state. These reactors for torrefaction can be
classified as bubbling fluidized beds and circulating or toroid fluidized
beds [36]. Bubbling fluidized bed ensures gentle and controlled heating
of  solids  thereby  showing  better  heat  transfer  characteristics  than
moving bed (Fig. 23b). The extensive gas-solid mixing due to fluidiza-
tion  results  in  rapid  and  homogeneous  heat  transfer  between  the  hot
gases and the solid particles. However, it becomes difficult to separate
the biomass particles from the heat carrier solid particles, especially at
higher  gas  velocities.  Laboratory-scale  experiments  have  reported  a
significant losses in the torrefied fines for such reactors [209].

One  famous  example  of  a  commercial  fluidized  bed  reactor  is  the
Torbed design (by Topell in the Netherlands), in which due to the high
rate of heat transfer, the average residence time of biomass inside the
reactor is only about 80 s, therefore resulting in a small reactor size for a
given production capacity [132]. In torbed compact reactor, the process
gas  stream  impacts  on  and  minimizes  the  insulating  microscopic  gas
layer around each particle. As a result, the heat and mass transfer rates
are greater than in other types of reactors which ensures faster and more
effective processing.

6.3. Multiple hearth furnace (MHF) or Herreshoff oven

Multiple  hearth  furnace,  also  called  Herreshoff  oven,  is  a  vertical
cylinder lined with refractory including circular hearths that rotate in a
horizontal  plane  around  a  center  shaft  as  shown  in  Fig.  23c  [35].
Biomass is fed from the top hearth passing through a drop hole to the
hearths underneath and can be retained inside the reactor for 0.5 to 3 h
depending on the shaft speed and the number of hearths. The multiple
layers of the reactor assist in uniform mixing and gradual heating. After
first layer, the temperature of biomass gradually increases in the sub-
sequent layers, for example, from 200
C. Heat is supplied to
each individual reactor layer directly using internal gas burners or by
steam injection. Scaled up MHF reactors can have diameter up to 8 m,
which results in relatively low specific investments for large scales. The
MHF technology can process a wider variety of feedstock particle sizes,
ranging from saw dust to larger chips and even scraps for torrefaction
application.  The  technology  is  well  suitable  for  R&D  activities,  since
each  step  of  the  torrefaction  sequence  can  be  conveniently  accessed,
with the facility for accurate adaptive temperature control and injection
of  additives.  Typical  processing  time  is  30  min  from  top  to  bottom,
requiring high specific reactor volumes.

established by the injection of hot gases directly into the bottom of the
moving  bed,  and  the  hot  gases  then  flow  upwards  (counter-flow)
through the moving bed. The temperature gradient can also be set up by
the conduction of heat into the moving bed from the exterior in an in-
direct fashion. The reactor can be operated in downdraft mode too but
this would need additional modifications in design ensuring release of
flue  gases  separately  from  the  char  and  at  the  same  time  ensuring
continuous  feeding.  It  can  operate  over  entire  range  of  torrefaction
temperature  and  the  residence  time  of  20–60  min,  in  crossflow,  co-
current  or  countercurrent  manner  depending  upon  the  relative  di-
rections of solid and gas [45,208].

One example of a typical moving bed reactor is the TorspydTM design
by Thermya (France) (Fig. 23a), which was supported in modeling study
by Ratte et al. [144]. The advantage of a moving bed reactor is that it is
possible  to  fill  the  entire  reactor  volume  with  biomass  (unlike  some
other designs discussed in this section). Therefore, for a given produc-
tion capacity, the reactor volume can be significantly reduced, which
results  into  a  smaller  capital  cost.  The  major  limitation  is  that  the
moving bed reactor is often prone to inhomogeneity in the heat transfer
process,  as  the  biomass  may  not get  mixed  or  stirred  uniformly.  This
inhomogeneity rises particularly when an indirect heating method (e.g.,
heat conduction from the side or bottom walls) is involved.

6.2. Fluidized bed

A fluidized bed reactor contains a dense bed of fine biomass particles,
often filled with a heat carrier solid material such as sand with a high

The Belgium company CMI was the first to employ multiple hearth
furnace for biomass torrefaction over a large range of residence time,

temperature and biomass feedstocks. The French research centers CEA
and CIRAD later collaborated with CMI to carry out experimental and
modeling  studies  on  MHF  based  unit  of  40  kg/h  capacity  to  reduce
production cost and improve the torrefied biomass properties [210].

6.4. Screw or belt conveyor

Screw  conveyor  reactor  is  a  horizontally  or  vertically  oriented
reactor, with one or more screw augers that rotate in order to continu-
ously convey biomass through the system. The hot gases are transferred
to the external wall of the reactor or within the hollow shaft of a screw,
and the heat is indirectly transferred to the biomass. The heat transfer,

however, is somewhat better than the rotary drum, as in addition to the
heated outer wall, the screw itself can also be heated, thereby providing
a larger surface area for more effective heat exchange. In order to work
properly, the screw conveyor cannot be completely filled, and hence for
a  given  biomass  processing  capacity,  the  reactor  volume  should  be
significantly  larger.  The  screw  conveyor  is  also  a  relatively  proven
technology,  with  various  existing  torrefaction  designs  such  as  BTG
(Netherlands)
(Netherlands),  and  Biolake
(Netherlands).  Another  closest  variation  of  screw  conveyor  or  auger-
based  reactor  is  the  belt  conveyor  reactor  where  a  conveyor  belt  is
employed in place of screw conveyor for carrying the biomass through
the system.

6.5. Rotary drum

The  rotary  drum  reactor  consists  of  a  slight  downward  inclined
rotating cylinder. Biomass enters into the higher end of the cylinder, and
as  the  cylinder  rotates,  the  biomass  tumbles  (Fig.  23e).  Due  to  this
tumbling motion, biomass particles alternate in their contact with the
hotter reactor wall and the gas inside the reactor, resulting in a relatively
good mixing and homogeneous heating. However, the volatiles released
inside the rotary drum typically needs to be combusted elsewhere and
then redirected back to the outside of the reactor, necessitating an in-
direct mode of heating through the wall of the rotary drum, and this
therefore imposes some heat transfer limitations. Another major limi-
tation  is  that,  in  order  to  support  the  solid  tumbling  motion,  the
maximum fill volume of the reactor is limited to about 30% [211]. This
means  that  for  a  given  rated  production  capacity,  the  volume  of  the
reactor will be at least 3 times bigger than, for example, a completely
filled moving bed reactor, thereby resulting in a higher capital cost. On
the other hand, one benefit of a rotary drum design is that it is a rela-
tively proven technology with other applications such as biomass drying
and pyrolysis [212]. Therefore, most of the companies in Europe have
preferred to develop torrefaction technologies based on the rotary drum
design  using  either  existing  rotary  drum  suppliers  or  developing
custom-designed parts [132].

6.6. Microwave reactor

◦

The microwave reactor uses radiation energy to heat up the biomass,
allowing it to reach torrefaction conditions. Microwave irradiation in-
volves electromagnetic  waves in  the range 300 MHz  to 300 GHz and
typical  microwave  ovens  or  reactors  usually  work  at  2.45  GHz  [16].
Several laboratory-scale experiments have been carried out [213,214]
(Fig. 23e); however, limited work has been done so far to scale up the
design. The power adopted in microwave based torrefaction of various
biomass ranges from 150 to 400 W for the heating rates within 10 to
135
C/min  [43,215].  A  few  examples  of  commercial  pilots  include
Rotawave  (UK),  CanBiocoal  (UK),  Airex  (Canada),  and  Torrefaction
Systems  (USA).  Due  to  heating  rapid  and  uniform  from  microwave
[215], it can reduce the solid residence time and reduce the reactor size
for  a  given  solid  throughput  [216].  However,  this  is  shown  to  cause
drastic  intra-particle  temperature  and  torrefaction  inhomogeneity  in
thermally thick biomass particles [16]. Another major disadvantage of
using a microwave reactor is that the radiation energy required is most
easily generated by electricity. It is very difficult to generate electricity
from either heat or the chemical energy contained in the volatile gases
released from the torrefaction process. The complexity associated with
generating microwave radiation also means that there is often a high
capital cost and operational expenses associated with an at-scale design.
As  discussed  above,  there  exists  various  torrefaction  reactor  tech-
nologies,  at  different  stages  of  commercialization.  The  list  is  not

Summary of different torrefaction reactor designs at commercial scale.

exhaustive but does encompass the most common types of biomass re-
actors. Some of the reactors such as vibrating reactor, rotating-packed
bed reactor, spouted-bed reactor, modern REVE reactor have been dis-
cussed in [43]. Kota et al. [217] recently applied the readiness level (RL)
approach  for  torrefaction  set-ups  under  the  domain  of  technology,
market, regulatory, organization, and acceptance. The advantages and
disadvantages of the different designs, their technology readiness level
(TRL)  based  on  EARTO  scale  of  1–9  [218],  and  the  companies  using
those reactors are summarized in Table 11. The TRLs for different tor-
refaction reactor set-ups are presumed on the basis of the TRLs for other
biomass thermochemical conversion reactors [219] and the articles on
torrefaction market [36,220]. As observed, the rotary drum, fluidized
bed, and entrained flow reactors have reached the commercialization
stage with new plants coming up recently. Next in queue are moving bed
and auger/screw operated reactors which are more suited for small to
medium size applications. Feedstock and the torrefaction unit are the
major  contributors  to  the  total  cost  of  the  plant  with  each  of  them
sometimes contributing to up to 50–60% of the total costs [217]. For
feedstock, it is mainly the cost associated with collection, transportation
and  logistics,  whereas  for  the  reactor,  it  is  the  scale.  Hence,  if  raw
biomass could be procured from sources such as farms, wood processing
industry, rice mills, etc. or the equipment scale is brought down to a
level so that it could be operated in a mobile manner as reported in [70,
221], the overall cost could be significantly brought down.

7. Energy management and environmental impacts

7.1. Energy management

Torrefaction  is  not  currently  a  widespread,  commercialized  tech-
nology  within the  energy industry,  but it  does have  potential to be a
critical factor in greening power generation facilities sustainably using
residual  biomass  and  proper  energy  management  [30].  The  highest
amount of energy in a general torrefaction unit is required for drying
step (~1.3 MJ/kg to reduce moisture from 40% to 15%) followed by
actual torrefaction step (~0.7 MJ/kg for torrefaction of wood with 15%
◦
moisture at 280
C) [42]. In the usual industrial practices, the volatiles
are burned with air and some external fuel (e.g., natural gas) to produce
and supply the heat required for the drying and torrefaction processes.
There may be a need of burning additional external fuel depending on
the temperature of torrefaction and the moisture and volatile content of
the biomass feed. This presents a good scope for energy management in
the torrefaction systems, especially, the ones having a separate drying
step.

For inert torrefaction, the heat could be provided externally using a
hot  media  such  as  hot  oil  or  hot  gas.  For  oxidative  torrefaction  in  a
continuous reactor as discussed in Kung et al. [20,70], air-biomass ratio
can be adjusted accordingly to maintain the reactor at desired temper-
ature thereby eliminating the need for any external energy supply. In

either case, external fuel may still be required if the heat produced by
burning  volatiles  is  not  enough  for  pre-drying  the  biomass  feed,
particularly with higher moisture (>15%). Kung et al. [70] considered
trade-off between the economic and environmental benefits of having
low-oxygen environment in their design of a low-cost simplified torre-
faction reactor. The penalty due to loss of the mass and energy yield of
torrefied  product  under  an  oxidative  environment  is  not  a  preferred
outcome.  However,  the  savings  in  terms  of  energy  required  for  sus-
taining  the  process,  cost  of  cleaning  volatiles,  and  emissions  for  a
properly designed reactor with optimized percentage of oxygen could
balance the penalty [61].

Fig. 24 shows the torrefaction process unit with external and internal
combustion schemes for utilizing heat from the volatiles released from
biomass. The energy content of the torgas stream depends on the tor-
refaction  conditions,  and  mass  and  energy  yields  which  respectively
ranges from 50–90% and 60–95% for various biomass feedstock [48,93,
114,222].  The  external  combustion  scheme  is  better  suited  for  inert
torrefaction  in  a  reactor  with  a  jacketed  wall  whereas  the  internal
combustion  scheme  is  best  for  oxidative  torrefaction  which  may  not
need a jacketed reactor. In case of internal combustion, start-up phase
involves  burning  of  some  feed  biomass  in  excess  air,  after  which  the
process  is  sustained  in  autothermal  manner  by  adjusting  air-biomass
ratio in such a way that the required heat is provided by oxidation of
a  fraction  of  volatiles  within  the  reactor  [223].  This  results  in  the
emission  of  lean  torgas  compared  to  inert  case,  which  may  be  either
flared or combusted externally to provide heat for dryer or other similar
equipment.

Direct contact of the hot flue gas with biomass during torrefaction
could be an efficient way for heat transfer to the biomass. However, air
consisting overwhelmingly of inert N2  results in the handling of large
flue gas volumes which would translate into increased investments in
terms of piping and ancillary equipment. This issue can be avoided if
oxy-fuel  combustion  technology  is  applied  where  pure  oxygen  is
employed  as  oxidizer  instead  of  air.  In  such  process,  the  flue  gas  is
enriched  with  CO2  compared  to  conventional  air-fuel  combustion,
therefore making it easier and more economical to capture CO2.

Oxy-fuel combustion is also considered as a method for increasing
the  combustion  efficiency  and  reducing  the  NOx  emission  due  to  the
absence of air nitrogen [143]. So, a combination of oxy-fuel combustion
with  torrefaction  would  offer  multiple  benefits  including  improved
overall  efficiency,  reduced  flue  gas  volume,  easy  carbon  capture  and
storage (CCS), and reduced NOx emission [224]. It is important to know
the material and energy balance for each unit operation in the process
prior to developing strategies for energy management. The concepts of
net  energy gain  or life  cycle energy  analysis  are usually  employed  to
assess the surplus energy available for a process. Net energy gain is the
difference between the energy spent to harvest an energy source and the
energy  gained  from  that  harvest.  A  recent  study  on  groundnut  shell
torrefaction recorded the input energy of 0.15–0.21 MJ to produce 1 kg

of torrefied material, but net energy gain available in 1 kg of torrefied
biomass was 17.15–2.53 MJ/kg, respectively [225]. With these magni-
tudes  of  energy  gain,  torrefaction  units  could  serve  as  a  standalone
system  for  generating  bioenergy  products  irrespective  of  the  targeted
application.

7.2. Environmental impacts

In the process of upgrading biomass to a better usable product, tor-
refaction  systems  may  have  implications  throughout  the  bioenergy
supply  chain  starting  from  feedstock  procurement  to  the  product
delivered  to  the  end-user.  These  impacts  become  important  while
evaluating the  life cycle emissions  of the  process,  and hence  must  be
analyzed  to  ensure  the  sustainability  guidelines.  Life  cycle  analysis
(LCA) is a common tool employed for environmental impact assessment
of  torrefaction  of  different  biomass  feedstocks.  Findings  from  LCA
studies could contribute to the strategic design of the system and oper-
ations  involved  in  the  production  of  value-added  outputs.  Table  12
shows  some  of  the  relevant  LCA  studies  on  torrefaction  of  various
biomass for different applications. Most of these studies have performed
cradle-to-gate LCA for applications such as production of heat, power,
and fuel pellets. The common functional units are per unit mass or en-
ergy of output, or per unit distance depending on the application.

Ubando et al. [233] reviewed the LCA studies on torrefaction, py-
rolysis, liquefaction and gasification, of microalgal and lignocellulosic
biomass for bioenergy production. They inferred torrefaction to have the
least global warming potential (GWP) when compared with the other
thermochemical processes, mainly because of lower heat requirement,
improvement in calorific value of the raw biomass, and the higher solid
yield.  Similar  findings  were  reported  by  another  study  [234]  which
conducted  techno-economic  and  life  cycle  emission  analyses  on  eight
different negative emission technologies for power generation. For tor-
refaction facility, GWP appears to be highly governed by the utilization
of torgas and the heat required for drying raw biomass [26,232].

Though GWP is the primary indicator for LCA studies in the energy
sector, production and application of torrefied biomass may affect other
components  of  the  environment.  For  example,  raw  biomass  degrades
faster than the torrefied biomass and emits methane and N2O leading to
photochemical  oxidation  and  acidification.  When  a  coal  fired  power
plant  in  Netherlands  was  compared  with  torrefied  biomass  (20%  on
energy  input  basis)  co-firing  scenario,  the  later  showed  reductions  of
about  12%  for  GWP,  7%  for  acidification  potential  (AP)  and  5%
photochemical oxidation potential (POP) [235]. For providing equiva-
lent energy, the procurement of biomass and procurement of coal do not
have a significant difference because of lower calorific value of biomass
and the loss of some solid mass during torrefaction. For a similar study in
Chile  [205],  co-firing  coal  with  raw  or  torrefied  pinewood  pellets
showed reductions of 28–26% for AP, 15–7% for abiotic depletion po-
tential  (ADP),  15–12%  for  eutrophication  potential  (EP),  16–6%  for

GWP, 28–23% for POP, and 17–15% for human toxicity potential (HTP),
and  12–9%  for  terrestrial  ecotoxicity  potential  (TETP).  Most  of  these
indicators  become  significant  when  other  applications  of  torrefied
biomass such as soil amendment or wastewater treatment are consid-
ered. A study employed oxidative torrefaction to produce biochar from
the slash in Jackson Forests in California [221], and predicted the GHG
emission benefits of about 2.4 ton CO2/hectare at the estimated biochar
application rate of 1.8 ton/hectare within the forest.

For conducting LCA studies, Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) is an impor-
tant phase as it involves the compilation of data to quantify resource use
and  emissions  for  each  process  within  the  specified  system  boundary
[236]. A successful LCA study will depend on the reliability of LCI that
can be based on primary data, reports, academic literature, LCI data-
bases, and expert opinion. One of the bottlenecks in performing process
and environmental assessment is access to primary data, and most of the
studies apply tertiary data from the literature. The major application of
torrefied biomass pellets is established in the energy sector for co-firing,
making it a preferred choice for environmental impact analysis studies.
One of the recent studies analyzed life cycle emissions for production of
torrefied rice husk (TRH) pellets for a 26.5 MW biopower plant in Cal-
ifornia and established the techno-economic prospects for rice mills in
the region [232]. Fig. 25 shows the mass and energy balance for 1 ton

The discussed articles and few others published recently [237], show
that almost all the studies investigated the energy sector application of
torrefaction  technology  independently  or  in  comparison  to  its  fossil
counterpart.  Feedstock  procurement,  transportation,  and  co-firing  are
the  major  contributors  to  emissions,  and  hence  strategies  need  to  be
formulated to reduce the impacts of these stages. The residual biomass
which  would  have  ended  up  being  burnt  or  decomposed  leading  to
adverse impacts on air, water, and soil, should be preferred for torre-

co-products,  employment  opportunities,  carbon  credits,  and  the
biogenic carbon could further increase these benefits. Accounting these
factors  become  more  important  while  considering  the  applications  of
torrefied  biomass  in  iron  and  steel  industry,  soil  amendment,  land
reclamation, and as adsorbents for removal of contaminants. With the
new  studies  on  novel  applications  of  torrefied  biomass,  in  the  near
future,  we  can  expect  a  greater  number  of  environmental  impact
analysis-based  studies  in  different  geographical  contexts  for  diverse
applications of torrefied biomass.

8. Torrefaction applications

Torrefaction has the potential of becoming a key unit operation in
biomass upgrading schemes for a wide range of applications, including
biomass  storage  and  transport.  Fig.  26  shows  a  typical  torrefaction
process plant in the residual agricultural biomass utilization ecosystem
for different applications. The crop residue collected after a harvesting
season is dried and transported to a pre-processing facility where it is
subjected  to  screening,  size reduction,  and  further  drying if  required.
The feedstock is then supplied to torrefaction reactor mostly operated in
inert medium for which heat is supplied through an external combustor
consuming  either  torgas  or  natural  gas.  The  torrefied  product  is  then
grinded to a desired particle size and transferred to different application
sites.  This  biomass  upgrading  technology  of  torrefaction  could  have
tremendous  influence  on  other  biomass  densification  and  conversion
processes  with  some  obvious  benefits  of  torrefied  biomass  over  raw
biomass.  This  section  discusses  the  role  of  torrefaction  on  other  pro-
cesses related to biomass utilization, the applications, and the market
potential for the technology.

8.1. Densification

Densification  processes  such  as  pelletization  and  briquetting  are
commonly  employed  for  biomass  feedstocks.  Torrefaction,  as  a

pretreatment  process,  can  influence  densification  in  different  ways
depending on the sequence of the operation. ECN BO2-technology pro-
duced  cost-effective  commodity  fuels  from  a  wide  range  of  biomass/
waste feedstock with a high energy efficiency (>90%) [238,239]. The

preliminary findings of the group included easy pelletization of torrefied
biomass, low energy input required for process, and good quality pellets
with  better  combustion  and  gasification  performance.  The  energy
consumed  in  a  pelletizer  is  used  for  grinding  of  feed  followed  by  its
compression.  Torrefaction  is  known  to  produce  brittle  particles  of
smaller  size  than  that  of  feed  with  the  increasing  temperature  [125,
240]. The brittle nature significantly reduces the energy consumption
during grinding and the smaller particle size would reduce the energy
required for compression.

Arias  et  al.  [241]  reported  the  improvement  in  grindability  and
handleability  characteristics  of  the  torrefied  biomass  to  actually
compensate for the mass loss (20%) and the heating value yield (90%)
attained after torrefaction. In a study, mass density of raw eucalyptus
was 150 kg/m3, pellet was 486 kg/m3, but after getting pellet torrefied
at  250  °C,  the  mass  density  increased  to  557  kg/m3.  Similarly,  the
volumetric energy density increased from 9 GJ/m3 for raw eucalyptus to
12  GJ/m3  for  torrefied  pellet  at  275  °C  [242].  This  increase  in  mass
density and volumetric energy density of biomass makes torrefied pel-
lets a potential fuel for co-firing.

Torrefaction  and  densification  processes  such  as  pelletization  or
briquetting  increase  the  energy  density  of  raw  biomass,  but  it  is
important to decide if it is more valuable to densify and then torrefy or
vice  versa.  The  energy  requirement  in  these  two  cases  would  be
different.

Peng  et  al.  [91,243]  found  torrefied  softwood  more  difficult  to
compress into strong pellets than regular pellets under the same densi-
fication conditions. Increased die temperature and addition of moisture
to torrefied sawdust improved the quality of torrefied pellets, but more
energy  was  still  needed  for  compacting  torrefied  sawdust  into  pellets
(Table 13). The use of low-cost binders such as lignin, starch, sawdust,
etc. could reduce the energy required for densification and improve the
strength  of  the  pellets.  But  use  of  oxygen-containing  components  as
binders  is  against  the  purpose  of  deoxidation  and  homogenization  of
torrefaction. Hence, in-situ torrefaction and densification without having
a cooling step or binder addition step could be one of the solutions to
reduce  overall  energy  consumption  [244].  Larsson  et  al.  [245]  also
suggested  increasing  the  die  temperature  to  positively  affect  the
pelletization rate and negatively affect the bulk density of the pellets. A
pilot-scale  facility  (121–203  kg/h)  consumed  -15  to  +53  kWh/ton  of
torrefied  pellets  compared  to  raw  pellets  [246].  The  best  produced
pellets exhibited mechanical durability and bulk density of 87.5–98.7%
and 662–697 kg/m3 respectively.

There have been very few studies that preferred pelletization before
torrefaction. For example, Ghiasi et al. [247] found it difficult to bind
the torrefied biomass particles without a binding agent and reasonable
energy consumption, whereas they could pelletize raw biomass without

using  binding  agents.  They  reported  ‘‘torrefaction  subsequent  to
pelletization’’ as a promising strategy to obtain torrefied wood pellets
which  has  reasonable  transportable  properties  with  high  potential  in
different  end  product  applications.  Another  study  reported  the  slight
decline in the durability and tensile strength of the pellets after torre-
faction  [248].  The  torrefaction  treatment  decomposes  the  lignocellu-
losic  components  which  results  in  weakening  and  cleavage  of
lignin-hemicellulose  matrix  thereby  creating  the  voids  and  reducing
the adhesive forces between the particles.

Some  studies  highlight  the  economic  viability  of  production  and
consumption of torrefied wood pellets. Svanberg et al. [249] developed
a static model for the supply chain of raw material supply to the torre-
faction plant, including mass and energy balances for pellet production,
capital and operational cost estimations, and distribution system. Beekes
[250] compared the production and consumption of regular and torre-
fied wood pellets and estimated 15% lower logistics costs for torrefied
wood pellets. Mobini et al.  [251] compared the torrefied and  regular
wood pellets in terms of delivered cost, energy consumption, and CO2
emissions  along  the  supply  chain.  The  higher  capital  investment  and
processing costs of torrefaction  is compensated by  lower distribution,
storage and handling costs. The results show that torrefied pellets are
preferred  compared  to  the  regular  pellets  in  terms  of  the  cost  of  the
delivered  energy  content  when  long  transportation  distances  are
involved.

Based on the overall discussion till now, Fig. 27 shows the two cases
of integration of biomass torrefaction with densification. Densification
after  torrefaction  is  relatively  expensive  and  beneficial  for  end  users
such as power plant operators whereas torrefaction after densification
incurs  lower capital and operating cost for the manufacturer.  For the
applications  requiring  torrefied  biomass  in  powdered  or  fine  particle
form, there is no need of densification. The sequence of two processes
would also depend on the scale and availability of individual units. For
example, if the torrefaction facility is a centralized one located far from
the biomass source, it may be beneficial to densify the biomass at source.
The  market  price  of  torrefied  pellets  is  not  only  determined  by  pro-
duction cost, but also by product substitution value, including perceived
risks. In the regions with low prices for coal and a high perceived risk,
there will be limited willingness to pay reasonable prices for torrefied
pellets. Only if  significant  commercial  production starts up  and  trade
volumes increase, a true market value of torrefied pellets or briquettes
will be established.

8.2. Gasification and pyrolysis

Torrefaction has been explored for gasification and pyrolysis appli-
cations  by  several  studies.  The heat  requirements  for  torrefaction  are
smaller than those for pyrolysis at higher temperatures or gasification,
and could be satisfied by the sensible heat of the producer gas coming
out from the gasifier or from the gaseous product of the pyrolyzer or
torrefaction reactor [121,252,253].

Couhert  et  al.  [252]  quantified  the  impact  of  torrefaction  on  the
behavior of wood gasification by steam to produce syngas. Amount of
syngas generated increased with the rise in torrefaction severity because
of higher calorific value and lower volatile content of severely torrefied
biomass. The combined torrefaction and gasification process is similar to
two-stage  pyrolysis  and  gasification  technology,  with  lower  energy
requirement.  Pinto  et  al.  [254]  studied  the  gasification  of  eucalyptus
stumps in a fluidized bed reactor which were obtained by the different
pretreatment methods, and observed higher gas yield and cold gas ef-
ficiency with torrefied biomass. They observed the following order for
tar  contents  in  gasification  gas:  torrefaction  + pelletization  < torre-
faction < pelletization < raw biomass. Fig. 28 shows the effect of tor-
refaction  (250
C,  30  min,  eucalyptus  stumps  wood)  and  gasification
temperature on syngas HHV and tar content [254]. A study on entrained
flow gasifier reported cold gas efficiency of 54.52% for torrefied bamboo
under the optimum conditions, which was significantly higher than that

However, when compared with other pretreatment methods and with
proper energy management, torrefaction still has better advantages and
very promising potential in gasification. As the world is looking towards
green hydrogen as an essential component of a net zero energy system
[257], biomass gasification is being explored as one of the means for
H2-rich  syngas  production  which  can  be  further  processed  to  green
hydrogen.  Cheah  et  al.  [258]  reported  the  rise  in  H2/CO  ratio,  and
reduction  in  CH4  and  tars,  when  torrefied  biomass  was  subjected  to
gasification but most of the carbon fraction was converted to char. This
loss  of  carbon  to  a  less  valuable  product  along  with  the  carbon  lost
during  torrefaction  affects  the  economics.  However,  for  large  scale
centralized gasification plants involving long transport of biomass, tor-
refaction  as  a  pretreatment could  play  a significant  role  reducing the
cost  of  feedstock  procurement.  Moreover,  if  the  torgas  is  utilized  for
heating or drying purpose [232], and the char from gasifier is upgraded
to a good quality adsorbent or soil amender [259], there is a scope to
make  this  combination  of  torrefaction  and  gasification  economically
attractive towards green hydrogen.

for raw bamboo (28.98%) [255]. Raut et al. [256] reported a significant
decrease in tar content during gasification of torrefied poplar wood at
C, as 6.4 mg/g was obtained in comparison to 10.1 mg/g for raw
250
biomass  gasification.  When  poplar  wood  was  torrefied  at  300
C,  tar
reduction was even higher (3.08 mg/g), as tar formation depended on
the volatile matter content. Another study found that the gasification
efficiency  of  torrefied  sawdust  was  lower  than  that  of  raw  sawdust
because of the energy loss due to release of gaseous and volatile products
during  torrefaction;  those  products  were  not  used  in  the  gasification
experiments [253].

◦

It is observed that torrefaction may have both positive and negative
influences on the gasification process depending on the fate of volatiles.

Few  studies  have  investigated  the  influence  of  torrefaction  pre-
treatment on pyrolysis behavior of the biomass. The primary motivation
for using torrefied biomass in pyrolysis is to obtain bio-oil and biochar
with better properties mainly attributed to lower O/C and H/C ratios for
both solid and liquid products. Use of torrefied biomass produces bio-oil
with lower organic acids, furfural, and aldehydes but higher hydrocar-
bons (phenols, furans,  ketones, aromatics) and  carbonaceous residues
[260].  Bach  et  al.  [261]  found  significant  effects  of  torrefaction  tem-
perature  but  less  pronounced  effects  of  torrefaction  medium  on  the
pyrolysis  characteristics  and  kinetics  of  the  biomass.  Non-oxidative
torrefaction  affected  only  the  contribution  factors  of  individual  com-
ponents  whereas  oxidative
the
pre-exponential factors because of higher conversion of hemicellulose.
One of the studies investigated the effect of torrefaction on the pyrolysis
of rice husk in a TGA and a laboratory scale pyrolysis reactor [262], and

found that the increase in torrefaction severity reduced the bio-oil and
gas yields but increased the yield of char (Fig. 29). The promoting role of
combined  torrefaction  and  organic  acid  leaching  treatment  on
improving the quality of produced bio-oil was also confirmed. A study
on dry and wet torrefaction of tobacco stalk confirmed that the addition
of CuO and NiO during torrefaction increased the HHV of solid product
and  significantly  reduced  the  pyrolysis  activation  energy  of  wet/dry
torrefied biochar [150]. In their study on agricultural straws, Chen et al.
[263]  found  that  torrefaction  with  rapid  temperature  elevation  im-
proves  the  economic  efficiency  of  biomass  pyrolytic  polygeneration
because of reduced grinding energy consumption, increased char yield
and reduced water content in bio-oil. They suggested the torrefaction

Hu et al. [264] studied the thermal behavior and reaction kinetics of
the pyrolysis and subsequent in-situ CO2  gasification of torrefied corn
stalk pellets in a macro-TGA. With the increasing torrefaction temper-
ature,  they  observed  the  decreased  pyrolysis  rates  because  of  lower
volatiles  and  fluctuating  gasification  rate  because  of  reduced  surface
area and reduced potassium content in the char. The carbon conversion
rate during gasification was in the order 200 °C-torrefied pellet > 250
°C-torrefied-pellet  > raw-pellet  > 300  °C-torrefied-pellet  at  900  and
◦

C. A recent study investigated the tar produced during pyrolysis of
various raw and torrefied biomass such as pine, ash wood, miscanthus,
and  wheat  straw  with  different  particle  sizes  [129].  For  all  biomass
types, the tar yields for torrefied samples were 42(cid:0) 62% lower compared
to  direct  pyrolysis  of  raw  biomass.  However,  when  considering  the
condensable liquid produced combining torrefaction and pyrolysis, the
total yield of condensable liquid decreased by 3(cid:0) 12% compared to the
direct pyrolysis. Catalytic pyrolysis of torrefied biomass with high mo-
lecular weight compounds such as tar is looked upon as a promising way
to produce useful chemicals. Kim et al. [265] obtained higher yields of
aromatic  hydrocarbons  for  in  situ  catalytic  co-pyrolysis  of  torrefied
biomass than non-torrefied biomass and ex situ catalytic pyrolysis. The
most prominent reason was more effective contact between the pyrolysis
vapors  and  the  catalyst  (HZSM-5)  over  torrefied  biomass  particles.
Torrefaction is also proposed as a means to protect the catalysts due to
reduced  vapor  production  by  pyrolysis  of  torrefied  biomass  and
decreased yield of coke because of the removal of coke precursors [266].
A  recent  review  highlighted  the  advantages  of  pyrolysis  of  torrefied
biomass  in  terms  of  the  conversion  process  and  final  product  quality
over that of raw biomass [260].

8.3. Combustion and co-firing

In the process of torrefaction, energy yields are always higher than
mass  yields,  thereby  demonstrating  the  benefits  of  technology  in
concentrating biomass energy [81]. Hence, torrefaction is believed to
greatly  improve  the  thermophysical  and  combustion  properties  of
biomass.  This  is  also  obvious  from  the  fact  that  almost  all  torrefied
biomass  have  a  higher  heating  value  than  raw  biomass.  When  tested
using  lab-scale  Combustion  Simulator  experiments,  combustion  reac-
tivity  of  torrefied  wood  was  found  to  be  enhanced  compared  to  raw
wood  [238].  Another  study  evaluated  the  effects  of  torrefaction  on
combustible properties of bamboo for it is a promising energy crop for
the future [267], due to its low ash content, alkali index and heating
value. Pimchuai et al. [115] studied the combustion behavior of both
raw  and  torrefied  rice  husks  in  a  spout-fluid  bed  combustor  by
measuring its temperature history in different zones. The torrefied husks
ignited faster and raised the bed temperature to a higher level because of
its low moisture content. CFD calculations performed in SECTOR project
showed that due to higher volatiles in the fuel, more fuel gas was pro-
duced when burning torrefied material compared to coal, causing the
combustion reaction to extend higher up in the combustion chamber.
When coal was completely replaced by torrefied biomass, the flame size
increased  up  to  about  25%  [36].  The  main  reason  for  improving

combustion properties is the reduced moisture and higher fixed carbon
content in torrefied biomass, which partially contributes to the higher
heats of combustion.

The process of torrefaction moves the chemical and physical prop-
erties of raw biomass close to that of bituminous coal, which allows co-
utilization with high substitution ratios of biomass in the existing coal-
fired  boilers  without  major  modifications.  Li  et  al.  [268]  experimen-
tally  investigated  devolatilization  and  char  oxidation  kinetics  of  the
torrefied biomass, and developed CFD modeling of co-firing with vary-
ing  substitutions  of  torrefied  biomass  in  a  pulverized  coal  boiler
(Fig. 30). They showed that pulverized coal boiler could be fired 100%
by torrefied biomass without decreasing the boiler efficiency and fluc-
tuation of boiler load. The net CO2  and the NOx  emissions also signifi-
cantly  reduced  with  increasing  biomass  substitutions  in  the  co-firing
system.  New combustion  technologies  such  as  chemical looping  com-
bustion  (CLC)  are  also  being  explored  to  evaluate  the  effect  of  torre-
faction  of  feedstock  on  the  combustion  performance.  The  concept  is
based on burning the torrefaction volatiles using metal oxide as solid
oxygen carrier whereby the CLC flue gas, mostly non-diluted CO2  and
steam,  is  recirculated  to  the  torrefaction  reactor  for  heat  integration
[269].

Co-firing  of  lignocellulosic  biomass  represents  a  low  cost,  sustain-
able,  and  renewable  energy  option  that  can  provide  reduction  in  net
CO2,  SO2  and  often  NOx  emissions  [270].  Some  of  the  studies  have
quantified the combustion emissions for different torrefied biomass in
comparison to that for raw biomass and different types of coal. Torrefied
biomass have been found to have higher ignition and burnout temper-
atures  than  the  respective  raw  biomass  [271].  Yanik  et  al.  [272]
observed  lower  NO  emissions  from  the  combustion  of  untorrefied
biomass than those from torrefied biomass, despite their higher fuel-N
content.  However,  during  co-combustion  with  lignite,  both  raw  and
torrefied biomass showed lower NO and SO2  emissions, with torrefied
biomass  showing larger  reduction in  SO2  than raw  biomass.  A recent
study by Kim et al. [273] investigated the effect of biomass torrefaction
on co-combustion characteristics of coal and biomass blends and pro-
posed  to  increase  the  blending  ratio  of  torrefied  biomass  over  raw
biomass  up  to  30%  for  enhanced  reactivity  and  reduced  emissions.
Ndibe et al. [274] studied the combustion of different fuels including
coal,  wood,  and  torrefied  biomass  in  a  20  kW  electrically  heated
drop-tube reactor. White wood and torrefied biomass ignited faster but
took longer for complete combustion because of more elongated flames
due to higher volatile yields. Fig. 31 shows the CO, NOx, and SO2 con-
centrations  in  flue  gas  at  the  furnace  exit  for  different  fuels  under
unstaged and air-staged combustion conditions. Torrefied biomass and
their  blends  with  coal  showed  lower  CO,  NOx,  and  SO2  emissions
compared  to  selected  bituminous  and  lignite  coals.  Also,  air-staged
combustion proved to be significantly efficient for reducing NOx  emis-
sions  for  all  the  fuels.  Another  study  confirmed  the  enhanced  fuel
properties of corn stalk after combined torrefaction and pelletization,
but reported higher particulate matter emissions (especially PM0.1-1) for
torrefied pellets than the raw pellets, which further increased with the

increasing torrefaction temperature [275].

The economic benefits of the use of the torrefied product against raw
biomass  or  pellets  have  been  evaluated  in  some  studies  [36,37].  The
torrefied  output  from  the  reactor  is  a  biochar-like  substance  that  has
many  versatile  applications,  ranging  from  solid  fuel  for  combustion
(household  and  hotel  cooking,  industrial  heating,  coal  power  plant
co-firing)  and  soil amendment  to precursors  for  chemical and  biofuel
synthesis  pathways  (syngas,  biodiesel,  hydrocarbons,  etc.).  Table  14
shows  the  market  potential  for  different  applications  of  torrefied
biomass through different conversion processes. As already well docu-
mented in [96,268,276], torrefied biomass, in contrast to raw biomass,

is much closer in its characteristics such as combustion temperature and
grindability  to  fossil-based  coal,  and  therefore,  has  the  potential  to
replace coal partially or completely in power plants and other applica-
tions  such  as  cookstoves.  Often  torrefaction  is  combined with  pelleti-
zation  to  achieve  energy  dense  “black  pellets”  (in  contrast  to  white
pellets  made  from  raw  biomass)  with  longer  shelf  life  and  enhanced
properties [69,268]. Solid fuel in the form of charcoal or firewood re-
mains  a  common  cooking  and  heating  fuel  for  rural  communities  in
developing countries [277].

8.4. Soil amendment

Table 15
Farming responses for different biochar feedstocks.

The quality of torrefied biomass depends on chemical composition of
◦
biomass and torrefaction conditions. At higher temperatures (>275
C),
torrefied biomass resembles biochar in appearance and properties, for
woody biomass. When used as a soil quality enhancer, biochar can be
alkaline (high in pH), making it a liming agent to counteract soil acid-
ification [279] or can be acidic (low in pH), making it viable for use in
highly  alkaline  soils.  The  choice  and  application  rate  of  torrefied
biomass  will  also  depend  on  the  crops  as  different  crops  and  plants
prefer different levels of pH in the soil for optimal growth. Few studies
have explored the application of torrefied biomass for soil amendment
and land reclamation. When torrefied biomass produced at 250 °C was
used to amend clayey as well as loamy soil (pH: 7.8-8) for maize crop, it
gave similar performance to that of pyrolyzed biomass at 400 °C and the
control fertilizer of urea (46(N)-0(P)-0(K)) [280]. The application rates
for torrefied biomass and biochar were same but lower than that of urea,
clearly implying the preference for torrefied biomass on account of its
lower cost than the biochar. A recent study [281] observed the torrefied
biomass amendment to control the weed proliferation against the ver-
micompost amendment of salt-affected reclaimed land in South Korea.
This emphasizes the use of torrefied biomass at the newly established
restoration or afforestation sites. Another study tested the torrefied pine
shavings  and  rice  husks  for  soil  amendment,  and  observed  that  the
amendments reduced soil pH, with heavy torrefied pine shavings (300
°C) positively impacting the soil quality and crop yield [208].

Fig. 32 shows the application of torrefied biomass as soil amender for
different scenarios. Biomass with high ash content such as rice husk, in
addition  to  severe  torrefaction  conditions  especially  higher  tempera-
tures,  is  ideal  for  making  alkaline  biochar.  However,  for  net  alkaline
effect of biochar, it is important that the amount of basic oxides in the
ash is higher than the amount of acidic oxides such as silica [282]. Other
advantage  is  that  the  porous  nature  of  biochar  helps  to  retain  more
nutrients and water in the soil, potentially reducing irrigation needs and
promoting better plant growth [283,284]. Torrefied biomass is also re-
ported  to  provide  beneficial  elements  such  as  potassium  (K),  inhibit
accumulation of toxic element, and increase diversity of microbes in the
soil [281]. The addition of torrefied  biomass to the soil increases the
availability  of  water-soluble  elements  (K,  Na,  and  P)  which  becomes
readily  accessible  to  plants  [284].  Also,  the  increased  percentage  of
carbon  and  AAEMs  with  increased  torrefaction  temperature  assists  in
rising the conductivity and cation exchange capacity of soil [208]. When
mixed with locally available nutrient additives (such as compost, ver-
micompost  or  pure  boosters  such  as  urea)  to  complete  the  soil  re-
quirements,  in  some  cases  it  can  even  act  as  a  standalone  fertilizer
substitute [285].

The  actual  effect  of  torrefied  biomass  or  biochar  on  crop  yield  is
somewhat  mixed,  and  vary  from  study  to  study,  as  can  be  seen  from
Table 15. This is because the outcomes from many of these studies are
highly dependent on the input feedstock as well as the soil application
conditions and the types of crops being grown. However, most studies
that  reported  positive  influence  on  soil  properties  conducted  torre-
faction  at  higher  temperatures  (>250  °C).  This  is  because  the  severe
torrefaction conditions produce solid product closer to the properties of
conventional pyrolysis biochars that have been widely explored for soil

application. Owing to the lower production costs, it is interesting to see
some companies employing torrefaction in inert or oxidative modes for
soil amendment purpose. One of the companies has acquired govern-
ment  certification  to  sell  the  biochar  product  made  from  torrefied
biomass  to  farmers  in  Kenya  [222].  Few  companies  in  Asia,  North
America and Europe are also making strides in this area.

8.5. Other applications

Torrefaction modifies the physical structure of biomass opening new
fields of utilizing it in industrial carbonization, polymer compounding,
and other carbon related processes [34]. Torrefied biomass can be used
to  produce  syngas  of  desired  quality,  which  can  be  catalytically  or
enzymatically converted into valuable chemicals, preferably by Fischer
Tropsch process. Iron and steel industry employing blast furnaces pro-
vide  other  opportunity  for  using  torrefied  biomass  as  fuel  as  well  as
using blast furnace gas as carrier gas in torrefaction process. Few studies
have investigated use of torrefied biomass for substituting coal in iron
production [10], but issues related to alkali composition and high vol-
atiles content of torrefied biomass need to be resolved. Another appli-
cation is reduction of iron oxide torrefied biomass [233] to lower the
initiating  reduction  temperature  of  iron  oxides.  Torrefied  biomass
resembling  biochar  in  properties  could  prove  to  be  an  eco-friendly
adsorbent  for  removing  various  contaminants  from  air  and  water.  A
recent study reported the torrefied spent coffee grounds as a potential
adsorbent  for  marine  oil  spill  recovery  with  1.3  times  higher  diesel
adsorption capacity than the commercial activated carbon [293]. When
the torrefied coconut waste and orange waste were analyzed to remove
polycyclic  aromatic  hydrocarbons  (PAHs)  from  water  samples,  their
respective removal percentages were 47.09–83.02% and 23.84–84.02%
[294].

A  recent  market  study  on  biochar  applications  identified  the  soil-
based  application  as  the  highest  preferred  market  followed  by  filtra-
tion and manure management [295]. Since the torrefied biomass pro-
duced  at  higher  temperatures  (~300  °C)  resemble  biochar  in  several
properties,  it  is  possible  to  replace  conventional  pyrolysis  biochar  by
torrefied  biomass  in  most  of  the  biochar  applications.  Now  that  the
torrefaction  fundamentals, kinetics, models, reactors,  energy manage-
ment, and applications, are discussed, next step is to identify the market
opportunity for the implementation of the technology.

9. Technology deployment and market potential

Fig. 32. Application of torrefied biomass in soil amendment.

The scale of deployment of torrefaction technology, especially the

reactors, depend on the availability of the feedstock and the applications
of  the  torrefied  products.  The  applications  of  torrefied  products  may
include making activated carbon, utilizing char as fuel for power or heat
or feedstock for chemicals, making biochar-based fertilizers, and so on.
For a region with highly abundant biomass supply, the centralized large-
scale designs should be preferred whereas for a region with less biomass,
the decentralized small-scale designs should be preferred.

9.1. Scale of deployment

9.1.1. Centralized large-scale designs

The  scale  of  the  earlier  developed  biomass  torrefaction  units  was
influenced by biomass gasification units. Table 16 shows the designed
production capacities of most of the existing torrefaction reactors. Even
though some of these may have started as small-scale pilots, they have
been designed with an eventual large-scale operation in mind for the
operating context of primarily Europe and North America, in the vicinity
of  a  large  biomass  producer  such  as  a  lumber  mill  or  an  agricultural
processing mill. These designs are mostly concerned about utilizing the
economy  of  scale:  by  imposing  inert  or  near-inert  conditions  to  the
reactor, these designs maximize the performance and unit economics for
large-scale  torrefaction  deployment.  However,  due  to  the  complex
infrastructure  involved,  it  is  not  trivial  to  downscale  many  of  these
technologies  cost-effectively.  Furthermore,  there  is  no  assurance  of
consistent supply of homogeneous biomass for these plants depending
on the geography, seasonal variations, transportation logistics, and the
competitors  for  the  biomass  residue.  The  heterogenity  and  non-
availability  of  feedtsock  are  amongst  the  biggest  reasons  for  some  of
these reactors either getting shutdown or not being utilized to the fullest
of their capacity.

9.1.2. Decentralized small-scale designs

As discussed previously, since it is tedious to downscale the large-
scale reactor designs, it is important to develop new reactor designs or
set-ups  for  medium  and  small-scale  levels.  A  good  small-scale  design
should  be  fuel  flexible,  portable,  and  easy  to  control  and  operate  at
different conditions. Conventional torrefaction units will require cylin-
ders of inert gas (e.g., nitrogen) and the provision for supplying heat to
the reactor. In recent years, partial oxidative medium has been explored
as an alternative to inert medium with the objective of achieving higher
energy savings during biomass torrefaction [18]. According to Svanberg
et al. [249], oxygen-lean torrefaction has the potential to dramatically
reduce the complexity and capital cost of torrefaction reactors, thereby
addressing
the  aforementioned  cost-effective  downscaling.  This
approach was continued by Kung et al. [20,70,136] who demonstrated
the feasibility and continuous operation of oxygen-lean torrefaction at a
laboratory scale. After successfully testing the laboratory scale reactor of
1  kg/h  and  pilot  scale  reactor  of  20  kg/h,  the  researchers  envision
small-scale, decentralized, and portable torrefaction equipment capable
of supporting 1 ton/day conversion. The processing unit comprises of a
reactor and an air blower which can be easily transported to different
sites using a tractor or a small truck.

9.2. Economics and market opportunity

The conversion of biomass feedstocks into energy and other value-
added products is attracting interest with the increasing global desire
of  sustainable  development.  Since  the  introduction  of  torrefaction
technology,  few  research  labs  and  companies  in  North  America  and
Europe have been actively trying to get the technology to the commer-
cial scale. Reactors used for torrefaction have been designed based on
the equipment available for known technologies such as drying, com-
bustion and gasification. Commercial torrefaction projects are officially
being implemented in different parts of the world such as Derby (UK),
Quitman and Oregon (USA), Duiven (Netherlands), County Roscommon
(Ireland), and Dilsen-Stokkem (Belgium) to name a few, with the pro-
duction  capacities  exceeding  2  ton/h  [296]. Almost  all of  these units
operate on integrated systems that include pretreatment, torrefaction,
densification, energy conversion  and combustion [78].  Another study
[24]  also  supported  the  argument  of  integrating  torrefaction  facility
with other biomass preprocessing or upgrading processes, to form the
sustainable  and  cost-effective  feedstock  supply  chain.  In  addition  to
these commercial units, there are numerous pilot projects conducted on
torrefaction  all  over  the  world  since  last  decade.  Fig.  33  shows  the
predicted  industrial  use  of  biomass  and  torrefied  biomass  in  the  year
2025, as part of the total biomass consumed for energy purpose [296].
Europe  is  a  leading  market  followed  by  USA,  Canada,  Japan,  and
Australia  in  the  torrefied  biomass  consumption.  With  the  increasing
demand for coal in Asia and the growing concerns of emissions related
health issues in Africa, the utilization of torrefied biomass is expected to
grow in these regions competing with the other established markets.

The economics of torrefaction of biomass such as wood have been
analyzed  in  some  of  the  studies.  Shah  et  al.  [24]  proposed  a
techno-economic  model  based  on  mass  and  energy  balances  for  a
production-scale  torrefaction  system  (Table  17),  and  quantified  the
sensitivity  of  energy  and  cost  results  to  changes  in  initial  feedstock
moisture  content,  torrefaction  process  temperature,  plant  operating
window, and initial capital investment. For a rated capacity of 25 ton/h
◦
operating 6 months per year, the torrefaction process cost at 240
C was
estimated as 17.5 US$/ton, which could be brought down to 12 US$/ton
with the optimized operating window and capital cost. These costs are
extremely  lower  when  compared  to  the  other  studies  because  of  the
impractical underlying assumptions. A comparative study on torrefied
pellets and traditional pellets estimated the production costs of 3.3–4.8
US$/GJLHV in the short term and 2.1–5.1 US$/GJLHV in the long term, to
make torrefied pellets competitive with traditional pellets [25]. Almberg
[297]  carried  out  the  techno-economic  analysis  of  a  farm-scale  corn
stover  torrefaction  (annual  capacity:  910  ton  torrefied  product)  to
calculate the payback period based on the profitability of the torrefied
product  and  the  input  costs.  Annual  baseline  analysis  predicted  the
payback period of less than 6 years at an annual return of investment
(ROI) of 46%. Also, the recovery of torgas reduced the energy require-
ment of the complete system by about 70%.

Total cost of a typical torrefaction unit includes the capital cost, and
the costs of feedstock, labor, energy, and other costs specific to the plant
or  technology. Table 18  reports the  costs  of different components  for
torrefaction unit from different studies and the average value for each of
the costs. Though there is not a huge variation in total cost on mass (US
$/ton) or energy (US$/GJ) basis, there is a considerable variation in the
costs of individual components. Other costs contribute to nearly 30% of
the total costs, and hence are important but these costs are highly project
and  region specific. Amongst the known specific costs, feedstock rep-
resents the significant portion of the total costs and hence is an impor-
tant factor.

Most  of  the  reported  studies  have  estimated  the  cost  of  torrefied
biomass or biochar production for a large-scale centralized facility with
very few estimating for a small scale or portable facility. For a large-scale
plant of 100,000 MT/year, a study estimated the production cost of US
$190/ODMT  (oven-dry  metric  ton)  torrefied  wood  pellets  and  the
delivered cost of US$282/ODMT for biomass feedstock costing US$45/
ODMT [301]. For a small-scale portable system of 50 ton/day, a study
reported  the  cost  of  torrefied  woodchips  production  as  $223/ODMT
[302]. Sahoo et al. [303] recently carried out a detail techno-economic
assessment of three portable systems to produce woodchips briquettes
(WCB), torrefied woodchips briquettes (TWCB), and biochar from forest
residues.  The  delivered  minimum  selling  prices  (MSPs)  per  ODMT  of
WCB,  TWCB,  and  biochar  were  US$162,  US$274,  and  US$1044
respectively.  The  major  factors  influencing  the  MSP  of  solid  product
were capital investment (16–30%), labor cost (23–28%), and feedstock
cost (10–13%). With the growing interests in carbon credits market, the
torrefaction  plant  owners  can  bring  an  additional  income  of  US
$36–72/ton of torrefied wood, and further reduce the payback period
[301]. Radics et al. [300] had predicted the production cost for torrefied
biomass in the range of 111.2 to 55.1 US$/ton corresponding to 0.05 to
0.5 million BDT/year facility in the year 2030. These estimates surely
seem  to  be achievable  owing  to interest  and  advances in  torrefaction
technology and knowhow.

For  mass  commercialization  in  next  couple  of  years,  the  torrefied
biomass or pellets price will have to be lower than the current prices for
wood or raw biomass pellets. For example, cost of wood pellets in the
United States range from 122 to 300 US$/ton for a transport distance
from pellet mills between 0 to 2000 km [304]. The detail comparison of
the capital investment and production costs of wood pellets with those of
torrefied pellets for different capacities are reported elsewhere [42].

The  economic  performance  of  a  bioenergy/biofuel  plant  depends
primarily  on  facility  type  and  location,  and  the  biomass  type  and

availability  as  it  would  dictate  the  capacity  of  the  processing  facility
[303]. For example, for residual biomass such as forest or logging resi-
dues or agricultural residues on the farms available seasonally after the
harvest  season,  portable  systems  could  be  more  beneficial.  Several
studies have proposed that the portable pretreatment depots can reduce
the total investment cost and the logistics costs for the biomass supply
chain  [305,306].  However,  for  rice  mills  generating  more  than  20
ton/day  of  husk  on  daily  basis,  having  their  own  torrefaction  facility
could be a better choice [232]. This is because of the limit on the ca-
pacity  of  a  portable  system  and  the  high  rental  costs  which  the  mill
owners  may  end  up  paying  for  the  portable  facility.  For  the  portable
systems, both forest residues  and rice husks could be available either
free of cost or with small collection cost. But for a far located centralized
torrefaction facility, such feedstock will incur substantial logistics cost
along with some direct purchasing cost. Since residual or waste biomass
is a preferred feedstock for conversion processes such as torrefaction, it
is important to identify the potential sources of feedstock.

Cherubin  et  al.  [307]  has  estimated  the  worldwide  potential  of
different crop residues as: cereals (e.g. barley, corn, millet), legumes (e.
g.  beans,  chickpeas,  groundnut),  oil  crops  (e.g.  linseed,  sesame,  sun-
flower),  and  sugar  crop  (e.g.  sugar  beet,  sugarcane,  potatoes).  Alto-
gether, the total global crop residue is estimated to be about 5.01 billion
ton/year with cereals providing about 72% and sugar crops providing
about 12.5% of the total residues. In terms of energy equivalent, this is
about 93.2 exajoules (1018 J), which is sufficient to satisfy the primary
energy demand of 16–17% of the world. For torrefaction plants, the cost
of such feedstock on dry basis falls in the range of 25 to 80 US$/ton [36,
278],  depending  on  the  location,  and  supply  and  demand.  However,
there  are  certain  possibilities  when  residual  biomass  feedstock  could
carry  a  negative  cost,  which  may  drastically  reduce  the  overall  pro-
duction cost. For example, landowners with biomass residues in areas
with  high  wildfire  hazard  or  densely  populated  community  areas  are
often  willing  to  pay  for  getting  their  residues  removed.  As  another
example,  in  peri-urban  wooded  areas,  regulations  often  impose  a
requirement to transport excess non-merchantable biomass feedstock to
the  landfill  rather  than  allowing  for  open-air  burning  as  a  disposal
method.  In such  cases,  production  of  torrefied  biomass  or  pellets  can
often reap the financial benefit of the avoided tipping fees, which could
run as high as $125/ton, with a median of $45/ton in California [308].
While  the  worldwide  biomass  potential  is  enormous,  different
geographical regions have different types of biomass and different en-
ergy needs. Thus, a broad discussion without geographical specificity is
likely going to result in no inference. Considering the huge differences in
various  costs  associated  with  equipment,  land,  manpower,  etc.  in
developed and developing countries, we examine the case of biomass
utilization in the USA, India, and the Europe.

9.2.1. United States of America

While some of agricultural biomass in the USA is already utilized for
biofuel production, much biomass in the forestry sector remains unused.
For  example,  there  are  many  small  trees,  branches,  and  wood-based
residues which are unsuitable for subsequent processing as lumber or
paper pulp. If these residues are located close enough (within 20 miles)
of a lumber mill, then often the residues are incinerated as a source of
heat (known as “hog fuel”) [222]. However, in most cases, these biomass

residues  are  too  remote  to  be  recovered  economically  as  an  energy
source.  In  some  cases,  contract  loggers  often  have  to  charge  a  forest
landowner a net cost in order to haul these residues away. When mis-
managed, the biomass residues often lead to forest fires in the summer. It
is estimated that the total amount of forestry residues is just short of 150
million  dry  ton/year [309]. While  the  fuel  price  varies  from  place  to
place, a typical number is $60 per dry ton of hog fuel, of which up to
90% can consist of transportation costs [222]. Assuming that a torre-
faction process lowers the transportation cost by 30%, this technology
can  deliver  a  potential  $2.4  billion/year  as  additional  value  to  this
industry.

Some companies and projects in the US have already demonstrated
torrefaction facilities at different scales. As of 2015, there were about 10
developers operating a semi-commercial facility processing the biomass
at  the  rate  of  10,000  ton/year  [36].  A  company  in  Philadelphia
demonstrated a facility to produce 12 ton/day of torrefied wood, using
virtually  no  fossil  fuels  in  the  process,  with  the  exception  of  some
electricity  for  fans  and  other  ancillary  equipment  [310].  In  the  year
2017,  as  part  of  the  Waste  to  Wisdom  project,  a  big  team  of
multi-disciplinary researchers demonstrated the continuous torrefaction
facility producing 550 kg/h of torrefied briquettes from the forest resi-
dues [311]. The project reported the average production cost of torre-
fied  wood residue as US$260/ODMT of feedstock. One of the biggest
torrefaction facilities with the annual capacity to process 149,000 BDT
of woody biomass, is expected to be operational in John Day, Oregon by
the end of the year 2020 [312]. The combined torrefaction–densification
can  even  further  reduce  the  costs  and  thus  improve  the  economy  of
biomass. With the new entrants in the commercialization of torrefaction,
a number of realization projects are in the pipeline, typically ranging up
to 250,000 ton per year production capacity [36].

The price of torrefied biomass as a source of renewable fuel is ex-
pected  to  increase in  the  next  few years,  as  various states  implement
more stringent renewable energy generation requirements especially for
solid  fuel  combustion.  At  present,  the  highest  number  of  large-scale
torrefaction applications are found in USA. Torrefied-biomass produc-
tion and its applications could significantly increase biomass trade in the
national market. The potential drivers for development of torrefaction
industry in USA include high biomass production potential (~48 GJ/
year per capita), Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA),
Healthy  Forests  Restoration  Act  of  2003,  emission-limit-compliance
strategies at the state level, high paper and paperboard production, and
a world-leading position in steel and iron production [296].

9.2.2.

India

For India, a study by Hiloidhari et al. [313] estimated that the total
surplus biomass can provide an equivalent of 4.15 exajoules of energy
per year, or 132 GW of energy availability in the country. However, only
5.94 GW, or 4.5% of the total surplus biomass energy potential, is being
utilized as energy, as listed in Table 19. The possibility of this portion
getting  used  for  non-energy  purposes  such  as  fertilizer  (compost)  or
animal  mulch  is  hardly  accurate,  as  Hiloidhari  et  al.  [313]  in  their
biomass  energy  estimation  already  considered  and  subtracted  these
other  competing  uses  from  the  overall  biomass  energy  availability.

Though the current literature is lacking on a detailed accounting for the
fate of the remaining 95% of the energy potential, one cannot neglect the
possibility of using part of it for torrefaction industry.

The northern states of India often face the problem of pollution due
to open burning of post-harvest crop residue. The state of Punjab pro-
duces about 17 million ton of rice stubble every year, and of that, nearly
90%  is  burned  in  the  open  [315].  This  burning  releases  tremendous
amounts of atmospheric aerosols, some of which can travel miles, and is
considered a major contributor to urban smog in cities like Delhi [316].
Therefore, the negative public health effects of aerosol inhalation [317]
extend beyond just the local regions where the open burning occurs, to
large  metropolitan  areas  with  larger  population.  Furthermore,  these
atmospheric aerosols have historically contributed to a significant un-
certainty in  modeling climate change [318]. A more recent modeling
study [319] suggests that open biomass burning can contribute up to
18% of global anthropogenic CO2  emissions. The severity of this prob-
lem and the media attention has activated the Indian government to find
a solution. NTPC, India’s largest power utility, for example, opened bids
in 2018 and 2022 for biomass procurement for its power plants to in-
crease the mix of co-fired biomass. This new interest is also accompanied
by increasing studies on the suitability of local feedstock for conversion
processes.  This  opens  up  the  opportunity  for  technologies  such  as
biomass torrefaction which will not only provide solution to managing
residual biomass but also  will generate value  added products such as
heat and power. The increasing demand and the competition for coal in
India  and  China  will  result  in  the  increased  demand  for  torrefied
biomass  in  Asia,  which  may  gradually  replace  Europe  as  the  prime
consumer of torrefied biomass [296].

9.2.3. Europe

European  Union  (EU)  has  been  one  of  the  leading  promoters  of
bioenergy increasing its usage by 150% since the year 2000. Bioenergy
accounts  for  56.6%  of  the  total  renewable  energy  consumption  in
Europe [220]. From the three main sources of forests, agriculture, and
waste, EU has the current biomass supply of 6.2–18.2 EJ/year which is
estimated to reach 8–17.1 EJ/year by 2030 [320]. European Commis-
sion has set the target to achieve a climate neutral economy by 2050,
and the Green Deal aims to reduce the EU GHG emissions by 50–55% by
2030 [220]. In the process to achieve these targets, EU has become the
biggest importer of the biomass, primarily in the form of pellets, most of
it coming from Canada and the USA [321]. If torrefaction is integrated
into the pellet production and distribution supply chain, it would lead to
lower delivery cost and lower CO2  emissions because of the increased
energy density and shelf life. For instance, a case study model estimated
9%  lower  delivery  costs  for  torrefied  biomass  pellets  shipped  from
British  Columbia  (Canada)  to  north-west  Europe  [251].  This  sets  the
perfect platform for promising prospects for torrefaction technology in
Europe.

Most of the notable demonstrations of torrefied biomass application
are found in Netherlands, Sweden, France, Finland and Spain, with new
plants starting up within the last two years. Several industrial projects
have been supplemented by the European Commission research projects
“SECTOR”  and  “LogistEC”  along  with  numerous  privately  funded
research projects [296]. The EU funded project SECTOR (Production of
Solid  Sustainable  Energy  Carriers  from  Biomass  by  Means  of  Torre-
faction), produced about 150 ton of torrefied biomass from 12 different
raw materials  in 30 different set-ups, and contributed significantly to
onset of commercialization of torrefaction [37]. In the last decade, the
number  of  projects  on  torrefaction  and  pelletization  has  increased
leading to sectorial and geographical broadening and increasing interest
in the torrefied product. Europe has at least three industrial-scale plants
with  name  plate  capacity  0.1–0.6  million  MT/year  in  commissioning
stage  in  addition  to  a  large  number  of  plants  in  the  capacity  range
7–25000 MT/year [220]. Some of the leading companies in torrefaction
arena  include  Futerra,  CEG,  National  Carbon,  Polytechnik,  and  AFS,
which  are  accelerating  the  speed  of  market  deployment  of  torrefied

Council (IBTC) at Brussels founded in 2012 by Bioenergy Europe and the

technology and the applications.

future.  The  upgradation  of  kinetic  and  particle  models  will  not  only
improve the understanding of process but also contribute to developing
better reactor models including the scaling effect which could contribute
to efficient reactor designs.

10. Challenges and future prospects

Torrefaction is primarily a biomass upgrading technology. The main
motivation  behind  current  study  is  to  identify  its  characteristics  that
could influence subsequent applications and the challenges that could
impact them. Taking a step behind for a bigger picture of biomass supply
to end-use, objective is to identify the bottlenecks that potentially could
limit the preceding or subsequent processes. Strandberg [322] identified
the main limitations as the economy and efficiency of torrefaction plant,
and suggested that high impact areas of future research include efficient
use of the torrefaction gas, process integration, and overall cost reduc-
tion. The economy and efficiency are inter-related for this technology
and  hence  would  together  depend  on  several  factors  including  the
source, quality and supply of feedstock, operating conditions, demand or
application,  and  miscellaneous  factors  such  as  plant  site,  manpower,
emissions, etc. In addition, the factors such as capital, financing, market
maturity, and competition for feedstocks also need to be addressed. We
will address in this section most of these factors.

Though several biomass types including wood and some agricultural
residues have been explored for torrefaction, many more individual and
mixed  feedstocks  still  need  to  be  explored.  For  agro-residues  with
challenging physical and chemical characteristics, torrefaction is more
complicated,  unlike  wood.  Moreover,  the  economic  feasibility  of
building a torrefaction plant for such feedstock depends on the cost of
the raw biomass. The size of the plant depends on the amount of feed-
stock that it could receive from the nearby region to keep it in operation.
This stresses the need for developing accurate models or methodologies
to  evaluate  supply-chain  logistics  for  biomass  residue  in  a  given
geographical  context.  Furthermore,  alternative  sources  of  feedstock
from non-agriculture biomass such as garden waste, kitchen waste, some
components  of  MSW,  sewage  sludge,  and  algal  biomass  should  be
promoted.

In  terms  of  technical  challenges,  the  most  important  ones  are
achieving constant and well controlled product quality, scaling up the
process,  and  product  densification.  The  product  yield  comes  before
product  quality,  and  for  continuous  torrefaction  processes,  it  is  chal-
lenging to directly determine mass and energy yield since the reactor
must be controlled to operate at a steady state. Other challenges are the
production  of  homogenous  product  and  avoiding  interruption  due  to
reactor  failure.  This  points  to  the  need  for  developing  active  control
strategies to guarantee the continuous operation of the reactor.

Very limited number of studies address the optimization of the start-
up and shutdown strategies for torrefaction reactors. Torrefaction in a
controlled  oxidizing  environment has  contributed to reducing the en-
ergy  requirement  and  simplifying  the  scale-up  of  the  reactor.  Partial
combustion of the volatiles inside the torrefaction reactor creates better
heat transfer environment and, in many cases, the gases leaving have
enough  energy  for  preheating  the  fresh  gases  or  feed  entering  the
reactor.  However,  recirculation  of  flue  gases  for  either  preheating  or
sustaining  the  reaction  requires  further  investigation  for  different
reactor designs.

The reaction mechanism and kinetics for devolatilization of biomass
need  further  development,  especially  for  oxidative  medium.  These
studies should proceed in parallel with developing particle and reactor
level models for design and scaling. These models should include heat,
mass,  and  flow  dynamics  in  the  complex  dense  multiphase  environ-
ments.  Most  studies  have  reported  1-D  particle  and  reactor  models,
while  few  studies  have  reported  2-D  particle  models  and  3-D  CFD
simulation of torrefaction reactors. However, the challenges related to
complexity of devolatilization reactions, and morphological changes in
biomass particles will require great efforts to solve in the foreseeable

More  studies  are  needed  to  investigate  the  effect  of  particle  size
distribution  and  packing  density,  and  the  fuel  feeder  stability  and
effectiveness.  Densification  is  another  area  of  interest  in  biomass
upgrading as it is aimed towards increasing mass and energy density of
the  biofuel.  Pelletization  of  highly  torrefied  materials  is  more  chal-
lenging  than  pelletizing  untreated  biomass  and  may  require  some
additional  binders  and  more  energy.  The  combination  of  torrefaction
and pelletization, and the optimization of their individual characteris-
tics  therefore  require  further  investigation.  For  densification,  other
methods  such  as  briquetting  may  be  interesting  options  to  explore
depending on the nature and the location of the application. There is a
need to develop low oxygen or oxygen free binders for densifying tor-
refied biomass to sustain the benefits achieved by torrefaction. Emission
analysis  and  safety  aspects,  in  comparison  with  competitive  uses  of
biomass, need more investigation to prove the environmental impact of
torrefaction.

Reforming the torrefaction gas for upgrading to green chemicals or
synthetic fuels is an interesting topic for further studies. The extraction
of energy in the form of chemical may often be more beneficial than in
the  form  of  heat.  The  torrefaction  gas  consists  of  high  value  green
chemicals, and hence extraction and separation of the green chemical
products could be more beneficial than using entire gas for heating the
product.

Torrefaction may provide new opportunities to implement the use of
biomass in industrial processes, increasing the share of renewable en-
ergy  and  reducing  CO2  emissions.  For  instance,  biochar  from  torre-
faction can be used as reducing agents to substitute the fossil fuels like
coke currently used in metal production industries. Another interesting
idea can be using solar energy for biomass torrefaction and then using
torrefied  biomass  as  backup  fuel  to  substitute  natural  gas  in  concen-
trated  solar  plants.  Torrefied  biomass  is  highly  reactive  and  can  be
burned in pulverized combustion chambers in very short time allowing
the quick ramping up and down necessary in these plants. Further ap-
plications include the use as catalyst for tar removal or as adsorbent in
acid gas cleaning  devices  in air pollution control  treatments in waste
incineration plants. To the best of our knowledge these new applications
have  not  been  studied  yet.  Very  recently  research  on  torrefaction  of
several fraction of municipal solid waste (MSW) has been conducted as
method to increase the fuel-from-waste for waste to energy plants [315].
The carbon neutral nature of biomass as an energy source makes it a
preferred  substitute for  fossil fuels,  having  the potential  to tackle  the
issues  of  climate  change  and  energy  supply.  Global  climate  scientists
have  included  bioenergy  with  carbon  capture  and  storage  (BECCS  or
bio-CCS) in the pathways to achieve the limit of staying below 2
C of
global warming as agreed in the Paris meet [323]. Torrefaction can be
integrated as part of BECCS in several ways such as utilizing CO2 or flue
gas as torrefaction medium [324], capturing CO2 produced during tor-
refaction [325], or by utilizing torrefied biomass in soil amendment and
land reclamation thereby sequestering carbon [221,326]. Considering
the potential contribution of biomass torrefaction towards CO2  mitiga-
tion  through  different  applications  and  preventing  biomass  from
burning  or  decaying,  there  is  a  need  of  detail  life  cycle  analysis,  and
techno-enviro-economic analysis of the technology at different scales.

11. Conclusions

The primary objective of this state-of-the-art review is to analyze the
progress in the field of biomass torrefaction on multiple fronts. The re-
view addresses the relevant significant advances in torrefaction studies
for different biomass, kinetics and modeling, reactor designs, influence
on other processes, applications, environmental performance, and the
economic  and  market  potential.  An  extended  discussion  has  been

reported  on  torrefaction  kinetics  and  modeling  as  prerequisites  for
reactor design and scale-up. The number of articles, reports and theses in
this field have been increasing since the last decade. The most relevant
studies  are  critically  analyzed  to  explain  their  contribution  in  the
development  of  this  technology,  and  the  associated  challenges  and
future perspectives for research and developments are addressed.

Torrefaction can be carried out in directly or indirectly heated re-
actors, and in inert or oxidative or other mediums depending on the user
preference and application. The choice of auto-thermal reactor opera-
tion seems to be a preferable one, provided the process has sufficient
oxygen in carrier gas, and is capable of sustaining the reaction at the
desired conditions by in situ burning of sufficient fraction of the volatiles.
Torrefaction is often an intermediate step in the fuel supply chain when
the end-use is another process such as gasification or combustion, hence
the  final  product  characteristics  should  be  the  main  concern  while
deciding  the  operating  conditions.  The  index  of  torrefaction  has  the
potential to be a single parameter representing the degree of torrefaction
in relation to other secondary characteristics such as mass yield, energy
yield, higher heating value, variations in proximate and ultimate ana-
lyses.  The  effect  of  biomass  composition,  and  different  operating  pa-
rameters was studied and temperature is found to be the most significant
parameter governing torrefaction.

Torrefaction kinetics has been systematically investigated for several
biomass  and  their  major  components,  under  both  inert  and  partial
oxidation environments. The energy and mass yield, moisture retention,
and particle size of torrefied pellets depend on the mass loss at a given
temperature  and  residence  time.  The  kinetic  model  with  appropriate
reaction mechanism incorporating all the changes occurring during the
process  throughout  the  torrefaction  zone  could  prove  to  be  the  most
desired model. Numerous 1-D models have been proposed for particle
and reactor scale, using the two-step reaction scheme with a solid in-
termediate.  However, there  is a  need to  improvise these models with
wider range of experimental data providing more detail insights. Any
improvement  in  kinetic  and  particle  models  will  reflect  in  improving
reactor models which could contribute to efficient reactor designs.

At  present,  the  torrefaction  of  biomass  is  still  at  the  experimental
level with few pilots in operation but R&D results have generated much
interest  in  the  energy community. Though  torrefaction  seems  to  be a
promising  technology  for  managing  biomass  residue  and  generating
energy  and  economic  value,  the  risk  of  widespread  consumption  of
biomass affecting water, soil, and the food supply chain should not be
ignored. Hence, the utilization of either waste biomass or environmen-
tally  friendly,  more  abundant,  and  faster  growing  biomass  should  be
targeted for this technology. Considering the market potential of pro-
ducer gas and pellets, future work should be focused on developing in-
tegrated  torrefaction-gasification  processes  for  high-quality  syngas
production, and integrated torrefaction-densification processes for the
production of torrefied pellets at pilot scale. With increasing novel ap-
plications  of  torrefied  biomass,  there  is  also  a  need  of  finalizing  the
standard  for  torrefied  biomass  in  powder  and  densified  forms  by
updating the currently followed standard of ISO TS 17225-8.

The scale of torrefaction plant and mode of operation i.e., centralized
versus decentralized are important decisions to be made depending on
the  feedstock  and  application  context.  Earlier  commercial  efforts  in
torrefaction technology were aimed primarily at centralized large-scale
plants. Increasing pressure on fuel costs in the power industry led some
developers to focus on smaller scale applications for torrefied biomass.
For  these domestic  or  small  industrial  scale  applications,  current fuel
price  levels  may  be  more  attractive.  Additionally,  these  applications
require smaller torrefaction plant capacities. Several of these plants in
the countries like the USA, India, China, Brazil, and African nations with
abundant biomass would be able to reduce their dependency on fossil
fuels, solving the increment of energy demand in the long run.
