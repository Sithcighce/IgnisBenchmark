## üìã SAMPLE QUESTIONS

### Top 3 Passed Questions


#### Question 1 (Q1)

- **Type**: reasoning
- **Difficulty**: 4/5
- **Topic**: ignition_kinetics

**Question**:  
Why does increasing pressure shorten ignition delay time in combustion systems? Explain from molecular collision and chemical kinetics perspectives.

**Answer**:  
Increased pressure raises molecular number density, causing collision frequency to increase proportionally with pressure. According to Arrhenius law, reaction rate k is proportional to collision frequency and activation energy exponential term. At high pressure, elementary reaction rates accelerate,...

#### Question 2 (Q2)

- **Type**: concept
- **Difficulty**: 3/5
- **Topic**: flame_propagation

**Question**:  
What are the fundamental differences between laminar flame speed and turbulent flame speed in combustion systems? Which one dominates in practical IC engine applications?

**Answer**:  
Laminar flame speed is a fundamental thermochemical property representing the propagation velocity of a flat flame front relative to unburned mixture under quiescent conditions. Turbulent flame speed incorporates effects of turbulence-enhanced mixing and flame wrinkling, typically being much higher ...

#### Question 3 (Q3)

- **Type**: calculation
- **Difficulty**: 3/5
- **Topic**: flame_kinetics

**Question**:  
Calculate the laminar flame speed of methane-air mixture (œÜ=1.0) at 600K, 10atm given its reference speed is 0.4m/s at 300K, 1atm. Use the correlation SL ‚àù T^Œ± P^Œ≤ with Œ±‚âà2, Œ≤‚âà-0.5.

**Answer**:  
SL_new = SL_ref √ó (T_new/T_ref)^Œ± √ó (P_new/P_ref)^Œ≤ = 0.4 √ó (600/300)^2 √ó (10/1)^(-0.5) = 0.4 √ó 4 √ó 0.316 ‚âà 0.5 m/s
