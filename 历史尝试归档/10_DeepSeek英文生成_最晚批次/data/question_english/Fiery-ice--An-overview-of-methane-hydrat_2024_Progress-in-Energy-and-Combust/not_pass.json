How do temperature variations and geometric configuration influence these interactions according to the cited experimental evidence?",
    "standard_answer": "The paper provides limited but specific experimental observations regarding the relationship between hydrate porosity, self-healing, and combustion behavior. According to the cited evidence, Misyura and co-workers have attempted to understand the role of hydrate porosity and self-healing during combustion, indicating that porosity affects how combustion heat transfers through the hydrate structure and influences self-healing mechanisms. Additionally, experimental results clearly demonstrate that flame spread behavior differs substantially across the range of initial hydrate cake temperatures from -10°C to -80°C. This temperature dependence shows that both combustion characteristics and self-healing processes depend significantly on the geometric configuration of the hydrate sample and the level of sub-cooling present. The experimental observations suggest that when hydrates are strongly subcooled, heat loss to the core can freeze the water film created during dissociation, forming a protective ice shell that limits further methane release and combustion. In cases of slight subcooling, thermodynamic energy minimization drives the phase change where residual water film gives up energy as it refreezes, again creating a protective barrier. The geometric configuration affects how water drains from the hydrate during combustion, which in turn influences the heat transfer dynamics and whether self-healing processes can dominate over sustained combustion.",

      "2": "Similarly, as shown clearly in Ref. [90], flame spread is far different over the range of initial hydrate cake temperature from -10 to -80°C, which demonstrates that hydrate combustion behavior and self-healing depends significantly on the geometry and level of sub-cooling of the hydrate cake."
