    "question_text": "Why do conventional CFD methods like LES and RANS fail to predict the distribution of flashback velocities in boundary layer flashback scenarios, and what fundamental limitations in turbulence modeling cause this deficiency?",
    "standard_answer": "Conventional CFD methods fail to predict flashback velocity distributions due to fundamental limitations in representing extreme event statistics. LES provides phase-averaged trajectories but cannot capture the full probability distribution of rare, high-velocity flashback events because it models only the resolved scales and parameterizes subgrid effects. The closure models in both LES and RANS assume equilibrium between production and dissipation of turbulence, which breaks down during extreme events like rapid flame acceleration. These methods cannot adequately represent the intermittent nature of turbulent boundary layers where rare, high-intensity fluctuations enable flashback. The statistical sampling required to characterize the tail of the velocity distribution would require prohibitively long simulation times since extreme events occur with low probability. Additionally, current turbulence models lack the physics to capture the strong two-way coupling between flame propagation and turbulent flow modification during flashback events, where the flame itself alters the boundary layer structure.",
    "original_text": {
      "1": "Currently, available computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tools such as large eddy simulation (LES) and Reynolds-averaged Navier Stokes equations (RANS) can predict the average velocity of the flame front during a flashback. However, these methods will fail if the following question is posed: what is the fastest flashback velocity possible, or more formally, what is the distribution of flashback velocities possible?",
      "2": "Even LES, which considers unsteady evolution of the turbulent flow, only represents a phase-averaged trajectory of the system. The validity of existing models depends on the predictive questions that pertain to the given extreme event."

    "standard_answer": "Using binomial distribution statistics for rare event probability estimation, the required sample size N can be determined from the relative error requirement. For a rare event probability p=0.001 with relative error ε=0.01 and confidence level 95% (z=1.96 for normal approximation), the minimum samples needed is approximately N = z²(1-p)/(ε²p) = (1.96)²(0.999)/((0.01)²(0.001)) = (3.8416)(0.999)/(0.0000001) = 3.838/0.0000001 = 38,380,000 samples. This enormous number highlights the 'data-poor' nature of extreme events - even with 38 million observations, we only achieve 1% relative error for a 0.1% probability event. This calculation demonstrates why traditional Monte Carlo approaches are infeasible for combustion extreme events and why specialized rare event sampling techniques with variance reduction are essential for practical analysis of lean blowout probabilities in engineering design.",

    "question_text": "How do spontaneous flame topology transitions between V-shape and M-shape configurations in swirl combustors represent Type III-A extreme events, and what dynamical systems characteristics enable these intermittent transitions?",
    "standard_answer": "Spontaneous flame topology transitions in swirl combustors exemplify Type III-A extreme events because they occur as intrinsic features of the system's attracting set without external triggers. The V-shape and M-shape configurations represent different regions within the same attractor where the system naturally visits during its long-term evolution. These transitions arise from the nonlinear coupling between swirling flow dynamics, flame stabilization mechanisms, and heat release feedback. The attractor contains pathological subspaces where small perturbations in the recirculation zone dynamics or local equivalence ratio cause the flame to switch between stabilization patterns. The intermittent nature stems from the chaotic dynamics of turbulent swirling flows, where the system periodically visits regions of phase space corresponding to different flame topologies. This spontaneous switching between configurations represents an extreme event because each transition exposes combustor walls to different heat flux distributions, potentially causing thermal stress and durability issues. The fact that these transitions occur without changes in operating conditions demonstrates they are inherent to the system dynamics rather than driven by external parameters.",

    "standard_answer": "Hydrogen enrichment significantly increases flame reactivity, making the fuel-air mixture so reactive that the flame may not remain confined to the combustion chamber and instead propagates upstream. In swirl combustors specifically, the flame can exploit the low velocity regions near the walls to creep upstream into the fuel-air mixing chamber. This upstream migration is problematic because premixing chambers are typically not designed to withstand high-temperature gases, making them vulnerable to damage from flashback events. The combination of hydrogen's enhanced reactivity and the favorable velocity conditions in boundary layer regions creates conditions conducive to flashback, representing a critical stability challenge in hydrogen-enriched combustion systems.",

    "standard_answer": "The dynamical systems classification categorizes extreme events based on their causal mechanisms, which directly informs the selection of computational strategies by mapping specific triggering mechanisms to appropriate computational tools. This classification framework provides a systematic approach to match computational methods with the underlying physical mechanisms driving extreme events, ensuring more efficient and accurate predictions. The classification is formulated by utilizing a dynamical systems approach where the state of the system is considered to be an infinite-dimensional vector that evolves according to the evolution equation. Extreme events can occur in different parts of the phase space and are triggered by many different causal mechanisms, including the presence of disjoint attractors. The classification based on these triggering mechanisms allows researchers to determine specific modeling paths and computational tools needed for each type of event. For instance, events triggered by controllable macroscopic inputs require different computational approaches than those arising from uncertainties in initial/boundary conditions or those stemming from intrinsic system dynamics. This systematic classification enables targeted tool selection by mapping event causality to computational requirements, avoiding generic approaches that may be inefficient or inaccurate for specific failure mechanisms in high-dimensional turbulent combustion systems.",
