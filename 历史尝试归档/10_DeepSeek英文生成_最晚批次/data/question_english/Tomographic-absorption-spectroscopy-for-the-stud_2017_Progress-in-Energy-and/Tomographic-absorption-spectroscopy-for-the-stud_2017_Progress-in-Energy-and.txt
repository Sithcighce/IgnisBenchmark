Optical imaging techniques are ubiquitous for the resolution of non-uniformities in gas flows. Planar imag-
ing techniques such as laser-induced fluorescence are well established and applied extensively in turbulent
reactive flows, offering both high temporal and spatial resolutions. However, planar imaging suffers from a
critical disadvantage, the requirement for spatially continuous optical access over large solid angles in both
the excitation and detection paths and this precludes their application in many practical situations, for
example those encountered in engine testing. Tomographic absorption spectroscopy, TAS, on the other
hand, shares many of the advantages of planar imaging techniques but reduces the demands for optical
access, because high quality data can be obtained with sparsely sampled volumes. The technique has unri-
valled potential for imaging in harsh environments, for example for in-cylinder/in-chamber engine meas-
urements. TAS is beginning to mature as a technique for the simultaneous imaging of temperature and
species concentration, and is experiencing a surge of interest due to progress in laser technology, spectros-
copy, and theoretical developments of nonlinear tomography techniques. The recent advancements in
broad bandwidth, frequency-agile laser sources massively enrich the spectral information obtainable in
TAS. Furthermore, nonlinear tomography enables the recovery of multiplexed information from a single
tomographic inversion. The utilization of multispectral information improves the immunity of TAS to exper-
imental noise and makes possible the simultaneous imaging of temperature, pressure, and multiple species.
Nonlinear tomography can also be used to empower the imaging potential of sensitive and robust absorp-
tion techniques, such as wavelength modulation spectroscopy, for use in harsh and even optically dense
environments. In combination, this greatly extends the applicability of TAS for more general and harsh sce-
narios in combustion technology. In this article we review basic concepts and mathematical foundations of
classical absorption tomography, proceeding to more advanced recent concepts based on nonlinear tomog-
raphy, and providing an extensive review of experimental demonstrations and practical applications in the
context of state-of-the-art combustion research.

1. Introduction

PCombustion remains the dominant form of energy production in
use today, and is an underpinning factor for modern society [1,2].
This dominance is expected to continue for several decades into the
future and thus a full understanding and effective control of combus-
tion processes is of paramount importance to improve energy effi-
ciency and to reduce the formation of pollutant species such as
particulates, NOx, SOx, and greenhouse gases [3,4]. Key to an under-
standing of combustion is an ability to measure chemical and physi-
cal flow parameters at high temporal and spatial resolution, and to
untangle the complex interplay between flow dynamics, chemical
kinetics, and heat and mass transfer, which remains a formidable

Pscientific challenge to this day [5]. There are several key parameters
such as temperature, species concentration, equivalence ratio, heat
release rate, and velocity, the quantification of which is essential to
any such effort, and requires their measurement under physically
realistic conditions. Numerous non-invasive optical sensing techni-
ques have been developed during the past decades for the diagnosis
of reactive flows. For simple laminar flames, such as laboratory
McKenna and Bunsen flames, point measurement techniques can be
used for the measurement of temperature, such as laser induced
grating spectroscopy (LIGS) [6], coherent anti-Stokes Raman scatter-
ing (CARS) [7(cid:1)10], and two-line atomic fluorescence thermometry
(TLAF) [11(cid:1)16]; Laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV) [17,18] for point
measurements of local velocity; line-of-sight-averaged techniques
such as tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS) [19,20]
for the simultaneous retrieval of temperature, species concentration
and pressure; and cavity enhanced techniques (CEAS) [21(cid:1)26] for

Pthe detection of minor flame species with the highest sensitivity.
Spatial variations of these scalar quantities can be measured by con-
secutive measurements in steady laminar flames. However, for more
complicated combustion phenomena such as turbulent model
flames,
ignition, flashback, and supersonic/hypersonic reactive
flows, which evolve rapidly and feature scalar gradients, the afore-
mentioned techniques are inadequate and imaging techniques with
high temporal resolution are required.

PGenerally, one can classify imaging techniques into two catego-

ries, namely planar and tomographic imaging.

PIn the former, a specific plane within the flow field is illuminated
with light from a pulsed laser source, and the ensuing signal e.g.
from Mie [27], Rayleigh [28], and Raman scattering, phosphores-
cence [29], or fluorescence [30] can then be captured via 2D array
detectors, often intensified CCD cameras. In most implementations,
the signals thus received scale linearly with excitation intensity.
Examples of planar imaging techniques include planar laser-induced
fluorescence (PLIF) [31(cid:1)34], particle imaging velocimetry (PIV) [35],
and laser-induced phosphorescence spectroscopy (LIPS) [29,36(cid:1)38];
and filtered Rayleigh scattering (FRS) [28], etc. Volumetric informa-
tion can be recovered through the sequential scanning of multiple
parallel planes [39,40]. The characteristic physical quantities
describing the flows such as the profiles of temperature [41(cid:1)44],
velocity [45(cid:1)49], and mixture fraction [50(cid:1)52] can then be inferred
from the obtained images. For example, two-line atomic fluores-
cence (TLAF) [53(cid:1)55] measures the florescence signals of two transi-
tions from the ratio of which temperature can be extracted; and
similarly simultaneous imaging of CH2O and OH yield heat release
rate in premixed flames [56(cid:1)59]. For ultimate spatial resolution, pla-
nar imaging techniques are indispensable, offering snapshots of
flame chemistry over spatial scales down to tens of micrometers
with ns temporal resolution and kHz repetition rate [34,60(cid:1)66].
Such capability is essential for the resolution of the characteristic
length scale of flow turbulence and its interplay with chemical kinet-
ics [67(cid:1)76]. However, the requirement for optical access often
makes them inapplicable in practical flame environments, for exam-
ple the combustion chamber of an automotive engine or a ramjet/
scramjet. Optical engines have been designed and fabricated to miti-
gate this drawback; nevertheless, the mechanical properties of the
original engines cannot be fully replicated. In addition, due to their
high costs, optical analogs are impractical to implement for many
engine models. Thus, planar imaging techniques are ideal for the
measurements of model flames for computational model valida-
tions, but less suited in the practical design of better practical com-
bustion technologies.

PTomography is the other imaging category, and here some of the
latter disadvantages are less prominent. In tomography one recon-
structs scalar fields from multiple projections, which represent sig-
nal integrals along various directions [77]. For applications in which
optical access is ample and where volumetric illumination is possi-
ble, tomographic reconstructions of 3D fields can be realized without

Pspatial sweeping of the illumination fields and thus without associ-
ated loss of time. Examples of volumetric tomography techniques in
combusting flows include tomographic PIV for volumetric velocime-
try [78,79], tomographic X-ray imaging for fuel mass distributions
[80,81], tomographic emission spectroscopy of either radicals or
soot distribution [82(cid:1)84], tomographic deflectometry [85(cid:1)89], and
tomographic interferometry [90(cid:1)97] for imaging of refractive index,
which can then be used to infer temperature distributions. There is
great potential also to implement other techniques of value to the
combustion community into tomographic variants. For example,
tomographic laser-induced phosphorescence could be conceived by
combining the work presented in [36] and tomography, hence one
could envisage the simultaneous measurement of volumetric tem-
perature and velocity distributions. On the other hand, for applica-
tions with limited optical access, planar tomographic variants can be
implemented. With both the illumination and detection arranged in
the same plane, the requirement for optical access can be greatly
reduced. In difference to planar imaging, in which the target field is
radiation intensity, the object field of tomography can be other phys-
ical quantities, such as absorption/extinction coefficients and refrac-
tive indices of flows. For example, absorption spectroscopy can be
combined with tomography to image the fields of absorption coeffi-
cients of the absorbing species at two or more transitions; the fields
can then be processed to simultaneously recover temperature and
species concentration fields [98]. A brief review of tomographic
techniques for flame diagnostics has been presented in Ref. [99].
Also, tomographic PIV has been the subject of several review articles
[100(cid:1)102] and book chapters [103,104]. Table 1 summarizes the
various tomographic techniques discussed so far and their applica-
tions in combustion research. The table also lists the range of years
over which the cited papers have been published, to give an indica-
tion of research trends that have emerged over time.

PAmong all tomographic methods, tomographic absorption spec-
troscopy (TAS) is the most promising for engine diagnostics, since it
does not require spatially continuous optical access, and mechanical
modifications (e.g. the drilling of holes) are minimal to adapt engines
for TAS. TAS also offers high species specificity and can be sensitive.
These features make TAS a powerful and attractive complement to
planar imaging techniques for technical combustion research. The
aim with this review is to provide a comprehensive summary of both
classical absorption tomography (CAT) and also the newly emerging
absorption based nonlinear tomography (ABNT) methods for the
study of gas dynamics and reactive flows. As indicated by its name,
CAT is an implementation of classical tomography [105], where one
records projections for one or two optical transitions along various
directions, resulting in the recording of so called sinograms. Sino-
grams can be recorded from multiple line-of-sight measurements
across a lateral plane through the sample volume, recorded, for exam-
ple on a line detector (2D tomography). Using an array detector one
can record several such planes at once (3D tomography), as demon-

Psinograms are obtained which are post-processed to obtain the distri-
butions of fundamental parameters such as temperature and species
concentration [108,109]. Since in a CAT process the target field is line-
arly related to the LOS measurements, i.e. the latter are the line inte-
grals of the former, it is also referred to as absorption-based linear
tomography. Theoretically, to make the equation system well-posed,
a large number of projections are required to obtain a sufficient num-
ber of equations. However, for practical engine measurements only a
few projections are usually available due to limited optical access and
hence the obtainable linear equation system often becomes rank-defi-
cient [110,111]. To alleviate this problem, many algorithms that were
originally developed for X-ray tomography techniques, where similar
problems exist, have been adapted to CAT for combustion diagnostics
[112,113]. For practical
irregular beam arrange-
implementations,
ments (‘regular’ means the projections are arranged in an equiangular
manner and the rays in each projection are equidistant) were also
adopted. Such methods maximize the spatial sampling efficiency, but
come at the cost of increased experimental complexity [114]. A fur-
ther problem in classical tomography is that it necessarily is only
applicable for measurands that are integratable (accumulative) along
the LOS. This greatly limits its compatibility with more advanced var-
iants of absorption techniques. For example, the calibration-free
wavelength modulation spectroscopy (CFWMS) technique [115] can-
not be combined with classical tomography in scenarios where the
optical depth is thick [116], since in this case the harmonic signals
cannot be linearized and the line of sight measurements do not repre-
sent the integrals of any physical quantity.

broad-bandwidth, wavelength-sweeping

PThese and related shortcomings can be addressed and overcome
by the recently proposed concept of nonlinear tomography [117,118].
Absorption based nonlinear tomography, ABNT, takes advantage of
rich spectral information that becomes accessible through use of
sources
novel
[117,118]. The extra information afforded by ABNT can enhance the
immunity of the technique against noise and successful reconstruc-
tions with ABNT were recently demonstrated from only two orthogo-
nal projections, when multiple absorption transitions were probed
simultaneously. This would be difficult to achieve with CAT and opens
the potential for ABNT to be used for engine measurements where
optical access is restricted [119]. The simultaneous processing of
information from a multitude of spectral transitions furthermore
enhances the immunity of the technique against experimentally gen-
erated noise [120,121]. In addition, ABNT enables use of advanced,
noise immune absorption techniques, such as CFWMS, which offers
enhancements in signal-to-noise ratios, SNR, of 10(cid:1)100 times over
standard absorption techniques and is exempt from a requirement to
fit baselines, offering immunity to laser intensity fluctuations. All
these features are highly desirable for the harsh conditions prevailing
in technical combustion systems [122]. Data from ABNT measure-
ments are fed into a set of nonlinear equations from which tempera-
ture, species concentration, and pressure distributions can be
recovered simultaneously [117]. In situations where optical access is
ample, ABNT achieves a similar spatial resolution as CAT for the same
number of projections, but offers improved immunity to noise [108].
However, ABNT is vastly superior to CAT in situations with restricted
optical access. In summary, the advantages of ABNT are two-fold:
first, it can accommodate more dimensions in the tomographic recon-
struction (e.g. multiple spectral channels) and it works more robustly
than CAT in data-limited situations, for example where the geometry
of the combustor is restricted and, e.g., only two orthogonal projec-
tions can be retrieved; second, it allows a combination of tomo-
graphic reconstruction methods with absorption techniques such as
CFWMS that are more advanced than possible with CAT. These advan-
tages open the field of tomographic absorption imaging to extremely
harsh environments such as coal-fired power plant boilers filled with
flying ashes or those encountered during in-flight engine monitoring
in the presence of vibrations, etc.

PThe purpose of this review is to give the reader a comprehensive
introduction into the physical concepts behind absorption based
tomographic imaging, exploring both theoretical and experimental
concepts. State of the art applications in reactive flow imaging are
reviewed and an outlook is given on potential developments in the
field. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: chapter 2
focuses on CAT and begins with foundations of tomographic imaging
and an explanation of common inversion algorithms, before present-
ing experimental considerations and applications of CAT; similarly,
chapter 3 includes the mathematical formulation, numerical studies,
experimental demonstrations and applications of ABNT. The review
concludes in Chapter 4 with a summary and an outlook on how the
field might develop into the future.

2. Classical absorption tomography

PClassical tomography originated from medical applications and
was later extended to other industrial fields such as process engi-
neering [152,153]. As indicated by the name, CAT is a combination of
absorption spectroscopy with classical tomography, and recon-
structs the distribution of absorption coefficients from integrated
line-of-sight (LOS) measurements along various orientations i.e. pro-
jections. CAT was initially demonstrated in axi-symmetric flames
[129,154] and later applied to more complicated flow scenarios to
reconstruct spatial varitions across a measurement plane, e.g. the
combustion process in an automotive engine [114,155,156]. In this
chapter, we summarise the mathematical formulation, inversion
algorithms, experimental implementations, and applications of CAT.

2.1. Algorithms for 1D classical absorption tomography

PIn some applications the scalar field to be investigated can be
mathematically represented in terms of only one independent spa-
tial variable, for example for a field that is rotationally symmetric. In
this case, the projections along arbitrary orientations are equivalent.
Thus a measurement of one single projection is sufficient to enable
tomographic reconstruction of the field and this is called 1D tomog-
raphy. The concept is illustrated in Fig. 1(a). For a target field that
varies only along the radial direction, its spatial distribution can be
described by a function f(r) and the corresponding LOS measure-
ments along the vertical line at x can be expressed as [157,158]:

λ ðxÞ(cid:3), where
λ ðxÞ denote the measured transmitted and incident light
Iλ(x) and I0
intensities at the wavelength λ, respectively. There are a number of
algorithms available to retrieve the field distribution f(r) from Eq. (2.1),
including two-point/three-point Abel transformation, the so called
onion peeling algorithm [157(cid:1)165], and finally the filtered back-pro-
jection algorithm [166], which will be introduced in detail in Section
2.2.1, because of its importance for non-axisymmetric tomography
applications. These algorithms have been thoroughly reviewed and
compared in Ref. [166] and for 1D applications the three-point Abel
(TPA) transform wins, as it is the easiest to implement, the fastest to
compute, and the least sensitive to noise of all three methods. The deri-
vation of TPA is briefly summarized below for the reader's convenience.

to investigate axisymmetric flames are reviewed in Ref. [157].

2.2. Algorithms for 2D classical absorption tomography

with two independent variables. In this case, many projections are
required for the reconstructions along various directions. The

Precovery of the field as a function of two spatial variables is defined
as 2D tomography. There are typically two categories of algorithms
to perform 2D inversions, they are either analytical (or transform-
based) or algebraic-iterative methods, respectively. The filtered
back-projection (FBP) algorithm is an example of an analytical algo-
rithm and has been widely applied in industrial X-ray tomography
[167]. On the other hand, the algebraic-iterative methods formulate
the inversion problem in a discrete manner and arrive at the solution
through iterative computation. Examples include the algebraic

PFourier space; and 2) take the inverse Fourier transform of the map
obtained to recover the object. However, due to the finite sampling
size of the LOS measurements, the low frequency image information
is amplified in the Fourier space. As a result, performing a direct
inverse Fourier transformation usually results in image blur, even
when the measured projections are free of noise. To de-blur the
reconstruction, an additional step is included, namely the filtering of
the original projection data. The entire operation is captured by the
following equation:

domain direct inversion [171], level set method [172], and the low
third derivative method [40,173] also exist, but are less widely used
in practice. The basic working principles of the most important algo-
rithms will be introduced in the following sub-sections.

P2.2.1. Filtered back-projection algorithm

PThe filtered back-projection, FBP, algorithm is based on the ana-

lytical solution of the Radon transform [174(cid:1)176], defined as

Z

pðu; tÞ D

f ðx; yÞdl

l

ð2:4Þ

where p(u,t) is the line-of-sight measurement at an inclination angle
of u with respect to the x-axis and located at a distance t from the
origin as shown in Fig. 2; and l specifies an integration path. Obvi-
ously, p is a 2 dimensional function and it is of key importance in
tomography. It is essentially the assembly of all projections into a 2D
format. The process of recovering the original function f from p is the
essence of classical/linear tomography. The foundation of the FBP
algorithm lies in the so-called central slice theorem, which states
that the Fourier transform of a projection at a specific angle is equiv-
alent to one slice of the 2D Fourier transform of the field at that
same angle, as illustrated in Fig. 2. Based on this theorem, the algo-
rithm can be implemented in two steps: 1) take the Fourier trans-
form of each projection sequentially and organize the results into a
2D map. The map then contains information of the original object in

where |w| is a ramp filter used to remove blurring.

PThe FBP algorithm works well if a large number of projections are
obtainable from the measurement object. One of its disadvantages is

the red square. The absorption length of the ith beam (the green line) within the jth
pixel is labeled as Aij. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure leg-

Fig. 4. Illustration of the working principle of the AART algorithm with one iteration step on a simple 2 £ 2 tomographic problem sampled with two orthogonal projections.

Pthat the projections need to be arranged at regularly spaced angles
to permit the Fourier transformations [177]. Thus, FBP is recom-
mended for applications where optical access is ample and many
projections can be arranged freely along arbitrary orientations.
Some example applications, ranging from simple flat flames to
exhaust flows from scramjet combustors, where the FBP algorithm
came to use, are found in Refs. [178(cid:1)188].

P2.2.2. Algebraic reconstruction technique

PThe CAT problem can also be formulated in a discrete format as
illustrated in Fig. 3. For this purpose, the region of interest (ROI), to be
probed in the measurement object is discretized into square pixels
which are probed by numerous laser beams. One representative beam,
with index i, is highlighted in green and the absorbance measured for
it denoted as pi. The absorption coefficient for the jth pixel in the sam-
ple is labeled as xj and correspondingly the absorption length of the ith
beam within the jth pixel as Aij. The absorption lengths of all beams
within every pixel can be compiled into an I £ J matrix. The forward
projection process can then be described by the following equation
* D AI£J x
p
*
where p
represent the sinogram and the original map of the
absorption coefficients, respectively, both organized in a vector format.
Since the tomographic problem is here modeled with a linear equation
system, classical tomography is also referred to as linear tomography.
Intuitively, the system can be solved by either calculating the inverse
of the matrix A or using Gaussian elimination. However, in practice,
the available number of projections is always limited, which can lead
to an underdetermined equation system, and because of noise, which
is always present, the matrix A is typically ill-conditioned.

PThe ART algorithm is iterative and features several critical advan-
tages that can overcome the ill-posedness of the tomographic prob-
lem typically encountered in combustion applications [68]. These
advantages include 1) robustness in the presence of noise; 2)
ability to reconstruct a field from a limited number of views; 3) abil-
ity to incorporate a priori information (e.g., smoothness or bounded-
ness) into the formulation to improve reconstruction fidelity; and 4)
the flexibility with the geometry of
the projections which
need not necessarily be arranged in an equiangular manner
[112,123,124,189(cid:1)200].

PThe ART algorithm is recommended for usage when the number
of the LOS measurements is moderately small (ca. 100(cid:1)1000). It is
discrete in nature [60,77] and has numerous variants such as the
additive ART (AART) [201] and multiplicative ART (MART) [39] algo-
rithms, and the simultaneous iterative reconstruction technique
[9,10,69], each with their own advantages in certain
(SIRT)

Papplication domains. Among these, AART is the most widely used
variant and is introduced in detail in the following paragraphs.

PFig. 4 illustrates the working principle of the AART algorithm on a
simple 2 £ 2 tomographic problem, sampled with two orthogonal pro-
jections. The upper left panel defines the tomographic problem. The
numbers in this panel indicate the measured projections. The objec-
tive is to find the values for each pixel that give rise to the measured
projections. As a first step (middle panel on the top) the algorithm
begins with a guessed solution, e.g. here assigning each pixel the value
0; in Step 2 the differences e between the guessed and measured pro-
jections are calculated for every LOS; in Step 3 e is divided up evenly
and distributed among (in practice: added to) all pixels along the LOS
and their values are updated; and the same procedure is repeated for
the second projection as shown in Steps 4 and 5. These steps consti-
tute one iteration in the algorithm. The iteration stops when a termi-
nation criterion is met. For example, the algorithm can be terminated
when the relative difference between the measured and predicted
projections is smaller than an acceptable error. We want to point out
that for the convenience of illustration, a 2 £ 2 tomographic problem,
which is fully determined, was used here as an example. In practice,
TAS measurements will normally lead to an underdetermined prob-
lem in combustion diagnostics. A rigorous mathematical expression of
the algorithm is encapsulated in the following equation [202]:

k is the estimated solution at the kth iteration; b a relaxation
where x
factor that controls the rate of convergence; <, > denotes the inner
product operation; pi the measured absorbance of the ith beam; and
*
a
k the ith row of the weighting matrix AI£J. It is obvious that the
computational cost is directly proportional to the number of projec-
tions and computational iterations.

PThe ART algorithm has been widely adopted in cases where a mod-
erately small number (c.a. 100(cid:1)1000) of LOS measurements is avail-
able. A few example applications can be found in [98,196,198,203,204].
The major drawback of this algorithm lies in the fact that it is only
semi-convergent [205,206], i.e. ART approaches the true solution at an
early stage but diverges away as the iteration steps increase. A detailed
description of this problem and ways of mitigation are found in [207].

P2.2.3. Landweber algorithm

PHaving become the most commonly used method in electrical
tomography [208], the Landweber algorithm is another iterative
method that has been widely
adopted in CAT problems
[67,114,155,156,169,209,210]. The values of x* in Eq. (2.7) can be ini-

from the equation, the errors in the estimated projections p

are back-projected through simple matrix multiplications. The Land-
weber algorithm has been effectively used in applications, where
only a very limited number of LOS measurements are available
(20(cid:1)100) and is the most suitable for harsh environments, e.g. dur-
ing in-cylinder/in-chamber measurements [155]. Similar to the ART
algorithm, the Landweber algorithm also suffers from semi-conver-
gence, which, in this approach, can be alleviated e.g. by defining an
appropriate termination criterion [211].

P2.2.4. Maximum likelihood expectation maximization

PThe maximum likelihood expectation maximization (MLEM) is
another iterative algorithm and has been widely used for tomo-
graphic PIV [212(cid:1)217]. Similar to the ART and the Landweber algo-
rithms, the measured projections are used to update and correct
initially guessed values of the pixels. The pixel values are updated
one by one during each iteration. The correction for the jth pixel can
be written as

PAll the beams passing through the specific pixel are used simulta-
neously to update the value with the absorption lengths used as
weighting factors. Compared with the FBP algorithm, the MLEM
algorithm does not require equally spaced projection data and can
produce fewer artefacts [218]. But the major issue with MLEM is its
slow convergence and high computational cost. In [219] the ART and
MLEM algorithms were compared for medical imaging applications
and shown to exhibit similar reconstruction performance, however
the former was estimated to be up to an order of magnitude less
costly computationally than the latter for a given task. Thus, the
MLEM algorithm seems to be appropriate only in cases which are
well-posed and where large numbers (> 1000) of LOS measurements
are available, and computational efficiency is not an issue. Examples
of MLEM in TAS are presented in [128,212].

Pbecomes underdetermined. The tomographic reconstruction via
Karhun-Loeve basis (TRKB) algorithm [220(cid:1)222] is a method
that takes advantage of available a priori information and thus
greatly reduces the dimensionality of the inversion problem. The
a priori information used in the method is contained in what is
called a training set, for example distributions of the target field
obtained from computational fluid dynamics simulations or from
alternative experimental methods. By performing a so called
proper orthogonal decomposition,
the eigenfunctions can be
extracted and used to approximate the reconstruction as
described by

obtained through POD are optimal since the minimal number of
terms is required to reproduce the original training distribution for a
given desired accuracy. The first eigenfunction is simply the mean of
the training set and the second represents the most prominent fluc-
tuation from this mean. By utilizing both the a priori (the training
set) and posterior (the measured projections) information, the eigen-

where k k2 denotes 2-norm, p
m are the measured projections, and
Peigen is a matrix with each column containing projections that are
calculated treating each eigenfunction as the real distribution. The
reconstruction can then be obtained using Eq. (2.10). Typically, only
a few eigenfunctions (ca. 10(cid:1)30), are needed for the tomographic
reconstruction; compared with the previous inversion formulation,
the number of variables is greatly reduced, making this method
especially suitable for scenarios where only a small number of LOS
measurements are available.

PTo summarize, the transform-based and iterative algorithms are
the most widely adopted methods for TAS to date. Although they
have been used in a number of specific applications, there has been
little discussion so far on how and why a specific algorithm was cho-
sen instead of another. In Table 2 we summarize the major algo-
rithms adopted in the context of TAS and point to relevant literature
and indicate relative merits and limitations.

Pthe noise from the LOS measurements. This leads to instability dur-
ing the deconvolution process and small perturbations to the mea-
surement data incur huge errors in the solution. This case is called a
discrete ill-posed problem. On the other hand, when the equation
system is underdetermined, i.e. the number of beams is smaller than
them number of grid points, the ill-conditioning is dominated by the
non-unique nature of the solution. This is referred to as a rank-defi-
cient problem. Because the mathematical manifestations of ill-pos-
edness vary, the appropriate strategy must be adopted to alleviate
ill-conditioning in a given case. We describe these in the following
sections.

PAs can be seen, g is used to regulate the relative weights between
the SVD components, resulting in a weakened influence of the com-
ponents with the smallest singular values.

PTo summarize, the ill-posedness of an overdetermined CAT
problem can be alleviated by either removing (via truncated
SVD regularization) or
reducing the weights (via standard
Tikhonov regularization) of the detrimental SVD components. For
a more in depth review of these methods, the reader is referred
to [127].

P2.3.2. Regularization for rank-deficient problems

P2.3.1. Regularization for discrete ill-posed problem

PFor discrete ill-posed problems, two regularization methods are
commonly used: The truncated singular value decomposition
method and standard Tikhonov regularization. Both are subjects of
this section.

As can be seen from the right-most term, the reconstruction error
is inversely proportional to singular values and will be greatly
dominated by the smallest ones. The solution can be improved by
removing a certain number of terms with the smallest singular
values in Eq. (2.15). This method is called truncated SVD regulari-
zation.

PAlternatively, standard Tikhonov regularization can be used to
mitigate the negative impact from measurement noise. Here the
problem can be formulated as:

PIn contrast to the discrete ill-posed problems, in which the recon-
struction error is dominated by noise contamination, the rank-defi-
cient (underdetermined) problems suffer from insufficient posterior
information, i.e. an insufficient number of LOS measurements. To
compensate for this, additional a priori
information should be
included in the analysis [116]. In CAT, the mostly widely used prior
information is the non-negativity constraint and a smoothness con-
dition for the target flow field. In this case one can perform a so
called constrained first order Tikhonov regularization, which accom-
modates this information as follows

PWe note that constrained first order Tikhonov regularization can
also be applied to discrete ill-posed problems discussed in the previ-
ous section; in this case, the regularization not only damps the insta-
bility caused by small singular values, but also enforces a priori
information such as non-negativity and spatial smoothness. For this
to be effective, g needs to be carefully chosen so that neither the a
priori (smoothness) nor a posterior (measurements) information
dominates over one another. So far, two methods have been
reported for successful estimation of g in absorption tomography,
the so-called L-curve method or a method based on SVD. The former
approach will be illustrated in detail in Section 3.2.2. The SVD
method suggests that the first I values (corresponding to the number
of beams) of singular values of the augmented matrix [A; λL] should
not be larger than the singular values of [A] alone. In contrast the
remaining (J-I) singular values of [A; λL] should be as large as possi-
ble. In this case, the regularization does not significantly affect mea-
surement fidelity while at the same time providing additional SVD
components (from the smoothness condition), which provide maxi-
mal noise immunity. Other interesting techniques might be feasible
for a determination of g, such as the unbiased predictive risk estima-
tor method or the generalized cross validation method, however
their merits in CAT have yet to be demonstrated. For more details
the interested reader is referred to [209].

PAs mentioned, the negative effects of ill-posedness can be miti-
gated through incorporation of prior information, as was shown for
the constrained Tikhonov regularization in the previous section. An
alternative approach has recently been demonstrated for CAT and
shown promise. It is based on a Bayesian formulation of the problem,
which provides a versatile tool to integrate a variety of prior infor-
mation in the inversion process. This can then be solved via maxi-
mum a posterior (MAP) estimation. Here, we provide one example
to show how the spatial smoothness and non-negativity priors can
be utilized in combination with the measured information in a

PThe values of prob(p|x) are always smaller than unity in the pres-
ence of measurement noise and their distribution can be predicted
by Eq. (2.22), below, if the noise spectrum is assumed to be normally

Panalogous to a first order Tikhonov regularization with a non-nega-
tive constraint.

PIt has to be noted that by customizing Eq. (2.21), more prior infor-
mation in addition to smoothness and non-negativity can be easily
accommodated. Bayesian formulation can further include temporal
information as prior. An example has been demonstrated where data
from computational fluid dynamics simulations have been combined
with CAT measurements data to improve the reconstruction and the
method works well even in low SNR measurement situations [127].

PTo summarize, the regularization strategy should be chosen
according to both the nature of the ill-posedness and how much
prior information is available. For discrete ill-posed problems which
suffer majorly from the measurement noise, a truncated SVD or
standard Tikhonov regularization can be applied to reduce the
impairing effects of SVD components with small singular values.

extensively and the authors are referred to [127,223(cid:1)225] for a

Preproducible fashion is critical since this determines the spatial sam-
pling efficiency and thus the reconstruction quality. In addition, as
an imaging technique, the quantification of spatial resolution is also
a crucial topic as it defines the applicability of TAS. The following
sub-sections will reflect on these considerations.

P2.4.1. Light sources and detectors

PVarious light sources have been used, or proposed, for tomographic
CAT measurements including HeNe lasers [170,198,221,226,227], KCl-
Li color-center lasers [171,222,228], semiconductor lasers (both tun-
able and single-mode) [112,114,155,162(cid:1)165,174,178(cid:1)180,184,185,
193(cid:1)197,199,200,216,229(cid:1)236], ND:YAG lasers, dye lasers [237], Ar-
ion lasers [188], light-emitting diodes [183], tunable fiber-ring lasers
[119,238], Fourier Domain Mode-Locking (FDML) lasers [239,240],
supercontinuum radiation sources [117], and frequency-combs [161].
PThe most widely adopted technology consists of tunable semi-
conductor lasers (TSLs), which offer advantages of low cost, narrow
emission line-width, rapid wavelength-tunability, and operation at
room-temperature. Furthermore, a broad wavelength range is avail-
able, e.g. 400(cid:1)3000 nm for tunable diode lasers (TDLs), 3 to 6 mm for
interband cascade lasers (ICLs), and 6 to 14 mm for quantum cascade
lasers (QCLs) [242,243]. Note that lead-salt lasers used in early appli-
cations [235] can today be replaced with QCLs [235]. Depending on
how the laser radiation is emitted, TSLs can be categorized into sur-
face-emitting and edge-emitting lasers, respectively. The selection
of longitudinal laser modes in TSLs can be realized either within the
cavity itself or externally and a few popular geometries are shown in
Fig. 5 above. The structures of TSLs include distributed feedback
(DFB), distributed Bragg reflector (DBR), external-cavity Littrow (EC-
Littrow), external-cavity Littman (EC-Littman), and vertical cavity
surface-emitting as illustrated in Fig. 5 [241,242,244(cid:1)247]. Panel (a)
shows the structure of a DFB laser, where a Bragg reflector is posi-
tioned above the gain medium. The Bragg reflector is made of hun-
dreds of dielectric layer pairs, each containing two layers with
slightly different refractive indices and acting as a reflective filter
with a narrow bandwidth (tens of MHz). Typically, one facet of the
DFB laser is high-reflection (HR) coated so that most of the light can
be channeled out through the other end which is anti-reflection (AR)
coated. Wavelength tuning can be realized by either modulation of
the driving current (fine tuning) or chip temperature (coarse tuning),
which induces thermal expansion and mechanical strain, causing
variations in the periodicity of the Bragg reflector [248]. Panel (b)
shows the structure of a DBR laser in which the Bragg reflector is
positioned adjacent to one AR coated facet and the other facet is
low-reflection (LR) coated. For DFB/DBR lasers, the wavelength-
selection element is integrated in the semiconductor chip. However,
wavelength selection can also be implemented outside of the chip.
For example Panel (c) shows the external cavity Littrow (EC-Littrow)
configuration in which one facet is HR-coated and the other one AR-
coated [246]. The emitted light is collimated with a lens and shone
on a diffraction grating, which feeds the first order diffracted beam
back into the chip. Both the output wavelength and the propagation

Pdirection can be adjusted by rotating the grating. The uncertainty in
beam orientation limits its applications for CAT. Panel (d) shows the
EC-Littman structure in which the grating is fixed and an additional
reflective mirror is introduced. This configuration guarantees a fixed
output direction and a narrower line-width at the cost of reduced
power since the loss incurring, and wavelength-dependent, diffrac-
tion occurs twice. Panel (e) shows the vertical cavity surface-emit-
ting structure of a laser diode which includes two Bragg gratings
both on top and bottom of the gain medium. Compared with DFB/
DBR lasers, VCSELs can achieve a broader spectral tuning range and a
higher modulation bandwidth, which makes them more suitable for
high pressure applications [246]. It has to be noted that CAT has
been evolving for decades and some of the lasers that had been used
in the past are now obsolete and have been replaced with a new gen-
eration of laser sources. Great potential exists for supercontinuum
sources, which will be discussed in the nonlinear tomography chap-
ter at a later stage in this review.

PFor the previous implementations, semiconductor photodetec-
tors as well as photomultiplier tubes were used for signal registra-
tion. Table 3 summarizes the lasers and detectors that have been
used. A more detailed summary of the detector technologies can be
found in [233,236,238,249].

P2.4.2. Beam arrangement and optimization

PAs illustrated in Fig. 6, there are three types of beam arrangement
for CAT, which are fan-beam [253], parallel-beam [175], and irregu-
lar-beam [114,169,232] arrangements respectively. In fanned beam
implementations, a diverging beam arrangement is used to produce
various projections directions as shown in Fig. 6(b). Mathematically,
the fan-beam setting (Panel (b)) is equivalent to the parallel-beam
version (Panel (a)). However, in an experimental sense, the optics is
simpler to set up for the former. On the other hand, the energy den-
sity of the fanned beams is lower than the line illumination that is
usually used in a parallel-beam arrangement, resulting in a smaller
SNR. Irregular-beam arrangements (Panel (c) and (d)) have also been
in cases where optical access is

PThe motivation for optimizing the beam arrangements is four
fold [169,255(cid:1)257]: 1) limited optical access in most practical appli-
cations; 2) beam obstructions, e.g. the beams cannot pass the central
axial of the drive shaft of an internal combustion engine; 3) cost
caused by requirement for multiple lasers and detection systems;
and 4) better beam arrangements to reduce perturbations from mea-
surement noise. The beam arrangement can be optimized using the
concept of the resolution matrix [255], which will be derived here.
As mentioned earlier, the tomographic problem results in a linear
equation system described by Eq. (2.6), which is usually rank-defi-
cient and underdetermined due to the limited number of projec-
tions. In order to make the equation system complete, a priori
information such as the smoothness of the distribution of the
absorption coefficients should be included and the optimal solution

For applications with limited optically access, the equation system
would not be complete and the regularization is used as a filter that
selects a solution that satisfies the measurements and at the same
time matches the a priori information best. It has been shown that
for limited-data tomography, the perturbation error is negligible
over a wide range of g and the regularization error dominates [113].
In this case, the optimal beam arrangement can be achieved when
the regularization error is minimized. The error can be quantified as
the Frobenius norm [255] of (R-I), defined as

is a vector of complex numbers,

(imaginary part) of a specific beam. The beam arrangement optimi-
zation can now be converted into a minimization problem, which
can be solved with a global minimizer such as the genetic algorithm
[256]. However, F is a good predictor for the reconstruction error
only when the number of beams are the same for all arrangements.
Otherwise, F has to be normalized by the number of beams so that
arrangements with different numbers of beams can be compared in
terms of efficiency.

P2.4.3. Quantification of spatial resolution

PAs an imaging technique, the spatial resolution (SR) of CAT is a
critical parameter for practical applications. However, there are only
a few studies available so far on this topic, for the following reasons:
1), the tomographic images are synthetic (i.e. reconstructed) and the
quantification of SR is not as straight-forward as is the case for pla-
nar imaging techniques; 2), there is a plethora of ways to define SR
(see [258]); 3), an experimental determination of SR is non-trivial
for CAT, because valid experimental phantoms are difficult to con-
struct for gaseous flows; 4), the SR for practical turbulent flames can-
not easily be inferred by applying the same tomographic system to
validation phantoms, because the SR does not only depend on the

Pspatial sampling (i.e. the beam arrangement) used, but also on the
SNRs of the individual LOS measurements. These may be dramati-
cally different for different measurement objects; 5), even within a
flow field, the SR may thus differ from position to positon, as they
are sampled with different beams and thus likely to result in various
SNRs; and finally 6), since noise levels of the LOS measurements
evolve over time, the SR changes even for the same position within
the imaging plane. There is still a lot of work to be done to provide a
framework for a quantitative comparison of SR between different
measurement scenarios in CAT. We provide an introduction to the
topic in this section, so that the reader can appreciate the challenges
and current thinking on this topic. We follow the approach taken in
[258], where SR was defined as a measure of the ability to resolve
non-overlapping features within the imaging space. In the article,
the authors quantified the SR through the calculation of a modula-
tion transfer function (MTF). The latter can theoretically be obtained
either from measurements of a point spread function (PSF), a line
spread function (LSF), or an edge spread function (ESF). However, it
is almost impossible in practice to fabricate point or line phantoms
with gaseous flows, and the authors demonstrate that the generation
of an ESF via two parallel flows is much more convenient to achieve
[258]. From the ESF, one can calculate the LSF, and PSF as follows:

Þ

ð2:30Þ

Þ D PSFðs; r0

r D r0 LSFðs; r0

ESFðs; rÞ D LSFðs; rÞ !

d
dx
where r and s are the axis parallel and perpendicular to the edge
respectively; and r0 defines a specific location along the edge. The
assumption here is that the PSF is rotationally symmetric, in which
case the LSF is a good approximation for it. The MTF can then be cal-
culated as a measure of SR as follows:
DFT1⁄2PSFðs; r0
ð2:31Þ
where DFT means discrete Fourier transform and fs stands for the
spatial frequency along the s axis. The MTF thus obtained provides
the experimentalist with a useful measure to adjust experimental
parameters, such as spatial sampling, beam size, to maximize SR and
also to assess reconstruction artefacts that come from measurement
noise and discretization errors.

P2.5.1. Overview

PCAT has found numerous applications in practical flow diagnostics.

The applications are summarized into the following three categories:

Pi) Laboratory flames

laser source on a flat-flame burner [175]; Villarreal and Varghese
demonstrated their system on an axis-symmetric flat-flame burner
[235]; Wang at al. demonstrated their system on NH3 flows [196]
and also a premixed methane/air [98] flame; Liu et al. demonstrated
their fan-beam system on an axis-symmetric flat flame [254,259];

tion to low-pressure stoichiometric premixed CH4/O2 flame

Pal. demonstrated a proof-of-concept system for simultaneous
imaging of both temperature and species concentration on a flat
burner [180]; the system was later applied to the exhaust plane
of the University of Virginia's Supersonic Combustion Facility
(UVaSCF) as well as at the NASA Langley Direct-Connect Super-
sonic Combustion Test Facility (DCSCTF) [178,179] to calculate
the combustion efficiency; Deguchi et al. developed a CAT sys-
tem for measurements of 2D temperature distributions in diesel
engine exhausts [229]; and Lindstrom et al. used CAT to study
the shock train structure in the isolator section of the supersonic
combustion facility at Wright-Patterson AFB [232].

Piii) Other applications
PBelotti et al. used CAT to reconstruct distributions of CO2 over
a volcanic site [250]; Bennett et al. were the first to demonstrate
the fan-beam tomography for tomography of gas dynamics and
measured the distribution of an iodine-vapor plume to experi-
mentally confirm a predictive noise theory [188]; Zhang et al.
used their system to study development of arcjet plumes as well
as how the mass flow rates and discharge current affect maxi-
mum temperature and argon number density [184]. Kasyutich et
al. used CAT to recover water vapor concentration to better
understand the chemical mechanisms of the chemical vapour
deposition process, aiding in the design of new coating heads
and providing a possible tool for process control leading to opti-
mized film properties [195]; Salem et al. used their tomographic
sensor to map the H2O concentration to investigate the break-
through of a packed bed adsorber [197]; and Kauranen et al.
demonstrated their high-sensitivity system for the measurement
of weak-absorbing O2 gas flows [216].

P2.5.2. Principle of two-line imaging thermometry

PThe principle of CAT for simultaneous imaging of temperature
and species concentration is summarized here. By performing
the tomographic reconstructions at two pre-selected transitions
(v1 and v2) with different temperature dependencies, two maps
of integrated absorbance can be obtained. According to Beer's
law, the integrated absorbance at frequency of n in the jth pixel
is defined as

where an [cm¡1] is the absorption coefficient at a frequency of n,
P [atm] the pressure, F is the lineshape, S [cm¡2(cid:5)atm¡1] the line
strength of temperature T, T [K] the real temperature, X the spe-
cies concentration, and L [cm] the absorption path length. As can
be seen, the integrated absorbance is a nonlinear function of T,
but a linear function of both X, and P. The ratio between the
integrated absorbance at v1 and v2 for the jth pixel can be

non-premixed mg flames [163]; Dahm et al. used CAT to map local
mixture fraction in a microgravity vortex ring diffusion flame [162]
to study how differential diffusion affects flame-votex interactions;

onstrated their technique on a flat burner [228], a non-reacting lami-
nar flow [170], a steady non-reacting flow of methane and argon
[221], and forced jet flows to study dynamics and structures of these
jets [171]; Santoro et al. applied their system to an off-axis turbulent
methane-air free jet to determine the mean methane concentration
throughout the mixing region [227]; and Shimizu and Sakai demon-
strated a tomographic system on a pulsed jet flame for temperature
and sodium number density imaging [260].

Pii) Practical combustors
PKawazoe et al. applied their system to an internal combustion
gasoline engine to investigate the hydrocarbon fuel distribution
[186]; McCann's group has developed tomographic systems for
the measurement of hydrocarbon fuels within automotive
engines [114,155,156,199,231,236,238,249]; Dahm et al. tested
their sensor on a model gas turbine combustor for potential
monitoring of premixing degree of fuel and air [198]; Bryner et

P2.5.3. Exemplar engine measurements

PAs mentioned earlier, CAT is highly complementary to planar
imaging techniques and is more suitable for applications where opti-
cal access is severely limited such as engine measurements. Fig. 7
shows an exemplar CAT imaging system [114], which was designed
for the imaging of hydrocarbon distributions in a 4-cylinder

Pautomotive gasoline engine (Ford Duratec New I4). The system was
tested extensively in laboratory phantom experiments [169] prior to
the engine tests. The key components of the system include an OPti-
cal Access Layer (OPAL), as shown in Fig. 8(a) and an optoelectronic
system. The OPAL defines the optimized layout of 27 measurement
beams and is illustrated in Fig. 8(b). Two fiber-coupled diode lasers,
with a wavelength of 1700 and 1651 nm respectively, were used to
probe the reactive flow within one cylinder of the engine. The
1700 nm laser was used to measure the hydrocarbon absorbance,
and the 1651 nm laser was used to probe a non-absorbing wave-
length for intensity referencing. The intensity of both lasers was
modulated at a frequency of 500 kHz and 300 kHz, respectively using
a direct digital synthesis module. An integrated wavelength multi-
plexing fiber coupler and 1 £ 32 splitter connects the sources to the
launch channels of the OPAL using single-mode fibers. On the detec-
tion side, multi-mode fibers transfer collected radiation to InGaAs
photodiodes. The transmitted signals were recovered using lock-in
amplifiers for demodulation of both wavelengths before transfer to a
PC for post-processing. A relatively homogenous fuel vapor distribu-
tion was generated within the cylinder for a validation experiment.
The pressure inside the cylinder was monitored with a transducer;
and the absorbance was assumed to be independent of temperature
(the temperature variation was calibrated up to 150 °C i.e. the limit
of the laboratory setup, and was found to be approximately constant
[155]). Before reconstruction, the quality of the measurements was

The figure reproduced from [114], with the permission from Elsevier.

Pexamined and data with an SNR below a certain threshold were
removed. The remaining data were then used for reconstruction.

PFig. 9 shows the reconstructions for six sequential engine cycles
using 15 qualified beams. The data sets were collected with the
engine running at 1500 rpm and 1.5 bar BMEP (brake mean effective
pressure) load, conditions under which the fuel distribution was
expected to be homogeneous. Each row represents one of the six
fired cycles, over the period between 150° crank angle (CA) and 30°
CA before top dead center (TDC) with intervals of 30° CA. The recon-
structions were quite homogenous and the absorption increased as
the fuel was compressed, as expected. Fig. 10 shows the reconstruc-
tion for one engine cycle in the period from 42° to 30° before TDC
sampled at 3° CA intervals. They were obtained under the same
engine conditions and using the same probing beams as Fig. 9. The
distribution of hydrocarbons varies significantly between neighbor-
ing crank angles and was successfully captured by the imaging sys-
tem. The measurements were validated qualitatively by comparing
the reconstruction to an estimated homogeneous distribution
assumed for the phantom. The same opto-electronic system, with 31
beams arranged in four parallel-beam projections, was successfully
used to image fuel distributions in single-cylinder optical research
engines, with direct fuel injection, running in both the spark ignition
mode [156] and the compression ignition mode [261].

PFor this application with limited optical access, absorption tomog-
raphy is uniquely qualified as an imaging technique that can be
applied without requirement for significant modification of the
mechanical and thermal properties of the engine. Nevertheless, the
implemented CAT system suffers from several disadvantages. For
example, referencing is mandatory to monitor the measured laser
intensity in absence of absorption, and the method is adversely
affected by mechanical deformations of the engine, for example due
to pressure changes. Furthermore, some probing beams may become
unusable due to lens contamination, making the data collection ineffi-
cient. The aforementioned limitations can be alleviated/overcome by
introducing a new imaging concept, which we have called nonlinear
absorption tomography, and its combination with recent develop-
ments in frequency-agile absorption spectroscopy and 1f-nomalized
CFWMS. These will be introduced and discussed in the next chapter.

3. Absorption-based nonlinear tomography

PAs can be seen from the previous chapter, CAT processes the pro-
jections measured at a single transition of the target species in the
tomographic reconstruction [196,198]. Theoretically, to make the
equation system full-rank, intensive spatial sampling is necessary to
obtain a sufficient number of equations. This increases experimental
complexity to provide access for projection deliveries. However, in
practice, applications such as engine measurements, have only limited
optical access and only a few projections will be available; the ill-
posed nature of the resulting inversion problem worsens. To alleviate
this problem, many algorithms that work well for limited-data tomog-
raphy have been adopted from X-ray tomography and adapted to CAT
for combustion diagnostics. As mentioned earlier, in practical imple-
mentations, an irregular beam arrangement was also adopted to max-
imize the spatial sampling efficiency, which increases the complexity
of the experimental setup. In addition, classical tomography is limited
in nature since it can only be applied when the physical quantity to
be reconstructed is integratable (accumulative) along the LOS. Such
requirements greatly limit the compatibility of CAT with more
advanced absorption techniques. In addition, for luminous reactive
flows, the tunable diode laser is the mainstream laser source but this
features only a limited spectral range in the near-infrared, making the
simultaneous measurement of multiple species difficult.

developments

PFacilitated by recent advances in broadband, narrow linewidth,
high repetition rate wavelength-swept laser sources, the simultaneous
sampling of numerous absorption features from multiple flame spe-
cies has now become possible [24,25,262(cid:1)267]. On the other hand,
lasers
the
[243,246,268(cid:1)270] and in frequency-multiplexed CFWMS [271(cid:1)276]
also enable the simultaneous detection of multiple orders of harmonic
signals. Encouraged by this progress, a new breed of tomographic
techniques, which sample not only the spatial but also the spectral
and/or harmonic domains were recently proposed. As opposed to CAT,
in which the target field is linearly related to the LOS measurements,
the target fields in the new variant have nonlinear dependencies on
the LOS measurements. In this case, the inversion problem can be
numerically modelled as the solution to a set of nonlinear equations

Pwhose variables are the profiles of temperature and species concentra-
tion. This circumvents the step of retrieving the distribution of absorp-
tion coefficients as required in CAT [117,118]. The result is a new
imaging concept, which we call nonlinear tomography, which brings
additional capacities. For example, it was numerically demonstrated
that pressure imaging is possible with this concept [117], pushing the
application limit of absorption tomography to scenarios where pres-
sure non-uniformities cannot be ignored e.g. the flow field in a scram-
jet where shock waves prevail [277]. The aim of this chapter is to
summarize the definition, mathematical formulation, simulative stud-
ies, and experimental demonstrations of absorption-based nonlinear
tomography, ABNT.

3.1. Mathematical formulation of ABNT

PIn the previous chapter, it was seen that for linear tomography 1)
the field has to be integratable along the LOS, and 2) the integration
has to be physically meaningful. Such requirements prevent the
implementation of CFWMS with CAT in scenarios where the optical
depth is thick [116], since in this case the harmonic signals cannot
be linearized and are not integrals of any physical quantity. Similar
limitation exists for combination of other advanced spectroscopic
techniques with CAT.

PTo overcome such limitations, the concept of absorption-based
nonlinear tomography was recently proposed [117]. As opposed to
CAT, which first recovers the profile of absorption coefficients, ABNT
circumvents this intermediate process, by directly solving for the dis-
tributions of temperature, species concentration, and even pressure,
avoiding the requirement that LOS signals have to be integratable.

PThe mathematical formulation of a typical nonlinear tomographic
problem is the focus of this section. As shown in Fig. 11, multiple
parallel monochromatic laser beams pass through the region of

Pinterest (ROI), which is discretized into a grid of M £ N squares along
the x and y directions respectively. The wavelength of the beams is
labelled as λ1; and the laser paths as lq, with q enumerating all the
beams. The measured LOS signals are denoted as ‘s0 and can also be
predicted with the function P, which describes the physical interac-
tion processes between the light and the ROI. They are a function of
both the wavelength and the spatial distribution of multiple inde-
pendent physical parameters denoted as m0s. As in CAT, the assembly
of LOS measurements along one orientation in nonlinear tomogra-
phy is termed projection, which leads to a set of nonlinear equations
as shown on the right of Fig. 11. If the monochromatic laser beams
were replaced with polychromatic ones as shown in Fig. 12, then a
2D (i.e. lateral and spectral dimensions) projection can be obtained
as shown on the right of the figure. Through rotational scanning of
the ROI, a set of 2D projections can be obtained, resulting in a 3D
map (i.e. containing lateral, angular, and spectral dimensions) as
shown on the right of Fig. 13. As can be seen, each stack (indicated
by a specific color) of the 1D projection shown in the figure is essen-
tially the counterpart of a sinogram in CAT for a specific wavelength.
The difference is that each element in the sinogram is treated as a
nonlinear equation rather than a linear one as modeled in CAT. In
addition, the nonlinear version of the sinogram can bear more
dimensions including the harmonic dimension if CFWMS is used to
detect multiple orders of harmonic signals. The sinogram contains a
set of simultaneous nonlinear equations whose variables are the
spatial distributions of the independent variables, i.e. m. The process
of recovering m from the nonlinear sinogram is called nonlinear
tomographic reconstruction.

PSo far the feasibility of ABNT as an imaging concept has been
demonstrated both with DAS [117] and CFWMS [118].
It has
been shown that two orthogonal projections are sufficient for a suc-
cessful tomographic reconstruction featuring intermediate spatial

Prespectively; S is the line strength of the contributing transition; P
the pressure; F the normalized Voigt lineshape function, which
approximates the convolution of the two dominant broadening
mechanisms (Doppler and collisional); and D is the grid spacing.
Panels (b) and (c) of Fig. 14 illustrate how different flow parameters
affect the spectrum of a specific absorption feature of water vapor.
Panel (b) contains three example spectra modeled using data from a
spectroscopic database with panel (c) showing normalized versions
of the same spectra to allow a better comparison of their shapes.
Each spectrum is modeled for a different combination of Tq, Xq, and
Pq. Water vapor was chosen in the model due to its prevalence and
abundance in hydrocarbon/hydrogen flames, and the availability of
frequency agile laser sources to target this species. Collisional and
Doppler are the dominant homogeneous and inhomogeneous broad-
ening mechanisms and overall broadening is a convolution of the
two, well approximated by a Voigt profile. At atmospheric pressure,
the typical full width half maximum (FWHM) of absorption features
is »0.1 cm¡1 or » 0.02 nm in the near infrared and this can easily be
resolved by the aforementioned laser sources. We want to point out
here that beyond scanning rates of approximately 1 nm per ns, line
broadening by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle becomes sig-
nificant [262]. However, resolution down to 0.1 cm¡1 resolution
is achievable at moderate sweep rates (ca. 100 kHz) [262]. Also,

Presolution, but greatly improved temporal resolution. The mathe-
matical formulation for both DAS and CFWMS are summarized in
the following sections.

tomography,

PIn DAS-based nonlinear tomography, the function P defines
Beer's law and m are the spatial distributions of the flow param-
eters such as temperature and species concentration. With the
aid of nonlinear
the absorption measurements
taken at different transitions can be used simultaneously during
the reconstruction process, which is not possible with CAT. In
this case, by increasing the number of sampled transitions, we
can effectively scale up the number of simultaneous equations
but at the same time retain the number of variables, i.e. the flow
parameters, at every coordinate. The inclusion of additional spec-
tral information can effectively mitigate the harsh requirement
in both the physical and the
for spatial sampling. However,
mathematical senses the spectral information is not equivalent
to the spatial counterpart, and thus the deficiencies in spatial
sampling can only be compensated to a limited extent by
increasing the spectral sampling. However, the incorporation of
multispectral information in the tomographic reconstruction will
enhance the noise immunity as compared with CAT [120]. Since,
in addition to spatial sampling, noise also has a determining
effect on spatial resolution, a better immunity to noise will bring
beneficial effects to the spatial resolution. In addition, there is no
limitation per se in the number of projections that can be accom-
modated by the DAS-based nonlinear tomography, however, this
comes with a commensurate loss in temporal resolution, due to
the beam scanning requirement [108]. But in this case, DAS-
based nonlinear tomography enjoys a much improved recon-
struction fidelity, due to better immunity against experimental
noise, such as originates from beam steering, window fouling,
and etalon fringing [278].

[23,280(cid:1)282], and
Fourier domain mode locking lasers [283(cid:1)286] could be used to
cover a large number of spectral signatures. For the tomographic
measurements, the light source is split into multiple beams to
map out the ROI or alternatively the beam is translated across
the sample volume. This is shown in Panel (a) of Fig. 14, which
also serves to illustrate the mathematical
formulation of the
problem. One of the laser beams positioned at the jth location,
denoted by lj, is directed along the LOS across the non-uniform
flow field (left sub-panel). Since the absorbance is accumulative
over the absorption path length, the overall absorption spectrum
along the LOS is obtained by summing up the spectra of each
resolution element traversed by the laser beam (indicated by
blue squares in Fig. 14(a). This leads to a projection spectrum
(right sub-panel) p(lj,λ) with λ indicating the monitored wave-
length. The absorption peaks that can be used for tomographic
inversion are named as λi with the subscript specifying wave-
length indices. The absorbance by the targeting species at λi is
the summation of contributions from non-negligible neighboring
transitions, as expressed by the following equation

Pthe features broaden quickly as pressure increases, which make
them easier to resolve. It is found that, for the particular feature
shown, the absorption intensity decreases with temperature and
that the FWHM changes slightly due to the impact of tempera-
ture on both line strength and shape. Other spectral features may
have different dependencies on temperature. It can also be seen
that absorption strength varies almost linearly with concentra-
tion. However, the problem is further complicated by the non-
uniform distributions of flow parameters. Looking at this problem
from another perspective, all information about the flow parame-
ters is contained in p(lj,λi); and through suitable mathematical
formulation and post-processing, the entanglement of all these
factors can be resolved and the spatially-resolved flow field infor-
mation can be recovered.

PThe DAS-based nonlinear tomography seeks to reconstruct distri-
butions of flow parameters over ROI and can be formulated into an
algebraic nonlinear minimization problem with a cost function
defined as

lem can then be solved via use of a global minimizer.

P3.1.2. Mathematical formulation of CFWMS-based nonlinear
tomography

PHere, we briefly summarize the basics of the CFWMS with
TSLs to facilitate the discussion of CFWMS-based nonlinear
tomography. In the CFWMS, the wavelength modulation can be
simply realized by imposing a high-frequency sinusoidal modula-
tion on the laser injection current, resulting in laser frequency
variations as:

nðtÞ D n C a cosð2pfmtÞ
ð3:5Þ
where n* is the line-center frequency; t the time; and fm and a are
the modulation frequency and depth respectively. The correspond-
ing laser intensity modulation can be described by

Þ C i2 cosð4pfmt C c2

0 is the average laser intensity at the line-center; i0 and i2 the

linear and nonlinear modulation amplitudes; and c1, c2 are the cor-
responding phase shifts with respect to frequency modulation. For
small a, e.g. a < 0.1 cm¡1, i2 is negligible and in this case the laser
intensity scales linearly with driving current.

structed and the actual profiles. The terms contributing to D are the
errors in projections, normalized to ensure their equal weighting in
the optimization. In an ideal case, where measurements are noise-
free and the spectroscopic database is accurate, D reaches its global
minimum (zero) when the reconstructions match the true profiles.
Additional information, such as smoothness conditions due to ther-
mal and mass diffusion, can be incorporated to steer the optimiza-
tion process toward a reasonably smooth solution by adding
regularization terms into the cost function. For example, the
smoothness of temperature can be implemented as the following
regularization term:

where Ttrial is the trial temperature distribution for the minimization

smoother and reaches zero when the temperature remains constant
(flat profile) across the ROI. Similar term RX can be implemented
analogously for concentration respectively. The cost function can
thus be modified as

PHere G is a scaling factor accounting for both the optical and elec-
trical gains of the detection system and transmission losses caused
by scattering, reflections, beam steering, window fouling, etc. By tak-
ing the ratio of Eqs. (3.11) and (3.12), the pre-factor cancels out. The
result, labeled as S2f/1f, defines the 1f-normalized, 2f signal that pro-
vides a calibration-free measurement unaffected by G. The normal-
ized signal thus only depends on laser parameters and absorber
properties (i.e. temperature and concentration) [288(cid:1)290]. For
CFWMS-based nonlinear tomography, Eqs. (3.11) and (3.12) actually
serve as the function f as introduced in Section 3.1. It has to be noted
that a more accurate model for the calculation of the 1f-normalized,
2f signals have been developed [276,291], which will be imple-
mented in a future version of ABNT.

PFig. 15 illustrates how the CFWMS-based nonlinear tomography
might be implemented in principle using currently available tech-
nology. Multiple laser diodes are used to probe multiple transitions
of the target species at the line centers with frequencies of nq, and
their output is combined using a wavelength multiplexer. Each of

the diodes is modulated at a frequency that is different from the
others so that its harmonic signals can be differentiated using lock-
in amplifiers. The multiplexed laser source can then either be split
into multiple beams to map out the ROI, or laterally translated across
the ROI in a step-wise fashion at the cost of reduced temporal reso-
lution. As illustrated in Fig. 15, a beam at the jth measurement loca-
tion,
is attenuated on passage through the ROI by sample
absorption, and picked up by a photo detector. The registered signal
is digitized and post-processed using a lock-in detection algorithm,
implemented in software, to recover the harmonic signals. This
recovers Q nonlinear equations for S2f/1f at each lj, where Q corre-
sponds to the number of transitions probed. Each S2f/1f is a function
of the profiles of temperature and species concentration along the
LOS. Thus, the tomographic sampling essentially results in a 3D
(angular, lateral, and spectral) sinogram and also a system of lj £ Q
to DAS-based nonlinear
coupled nonlinear equations. Similar

Eqs. (3.4) and (3.13), we can see that the only difference between
the cost functions is the term D, which is the model that is used to
predict the measured signal. So far, the pressure distributions have
been assumed to be uniform in demonstrations of CFWMS-based
nonlinear tomography. For applications with non-uniform pressure
distributions, the situation becomes more complicated because the
optimal modulation depth is lineshape-dependent, and both pres-
sure and concentration have an effect on the line profile. However,
the entanglement between pressure and concentration can be
resolved just like in the FAT case because the 1f-normalized 2f signal
has different dependencies on pressure and species concentration, i.
e. the absorption signal has a strong nonlinear dependency on pres-
sure but scales almost linearly with species concentration.

3.2. Numerical investigations

PIn contrast to CAT, which leads to a set of linear algebraic equa-
tions with local absorption coefficients as the variables, both DAS-
and CFWMS-based nonlinear tomographies result in an algebraic
nonlinear equation system. Because of this, none of the tomographic
algorithms introduced in Chapter 2 can be applied here. As discussed
in previous sections, the nonlinear tomographic problem is usually
converted to an optimization problem, so that additional informa-
tion such as the smoothness conditions acting as the constraints can
be incorporated to alleviate the underdetermined problem and
guide the optimization process towards a more sound physical solu-
tion. However, optimization, or to be more specific, minimization of
the cost function, is not a trivial task since it involves hundreds, or
even thousands, of variables, which create millions of local minima
in the solution space and make the gradient-based techniques
[292,293] impractical. Thus, a robust global optimization algorithm
is needed to escape local minima effectively and to land in the vicin-
ity of the global minimum. It has been proven that heuristic algo-
rithms such as the simulated annealing (SA) algorithm [294(cid:1)298],
genetic algorithm (GA) [299(cid:1)301], and differential evolution (DE)
algorithm [302(cid:1)304] are efficient in solving large-scale optimization
problems. So far, the SA algorithm has been favored for the solution
of the nonlinear tomographic problems; it is briefly summarized
here.

P3.2.1. The simulated annealing algorithm

PThe SA algorithm is a well-established tool that has been
widely employed in large-scale optimization problems to pinpoint
the global minimum among interfering local minima. A well-rec-
ognized advantage of SA is its insensitivity to the initial guesses,
which is a critical difference to derivative-based algorithms [119].
The SA concept originated from metallurgy and was first proposed
in 1983 [15]. The algorithm mimics the annealing process of
liquids, which are cooled down slowly until crystallization occurs,
i.e. a state with minimal internal energy is reached. During the
annealing process, the temperature of the liquid has to be low-
ered slowly enough such that the system can escape local energy
minima via random thermal fluctuations; otherwise, the system
can become trapped in a higher energy state. In the SA algorithm,
the cost function that is to be minimized is analogous to the inter-
nal energy of the liquid system that has to be lowered. The corre-
sponding parameter, TSA, is defined so that the annealing rate can
be artificially controlled. The random “thermal fluctuations” are

Psimulated mathematically by the so-called Metropolis criterion,
whose algorithm is defined as

where x* represents the variables of F; x

adjusting one of the variables in x
function. Eq. (3.14) represents the key step of the SA algorithm, in
*
which a new solution (x
new) is always accepted if it results in a lower
F; however, even a new solution which results in a higher F, is not
automatically rejected and is instead accepted with a certain proba-
bility pSA (to mimic random thermal perturbations). During the
annealing process, TSA is gradually reduced, and the probability of
acceptance as well as the magnitude of the thermal perturbations
decrease, resulting in convergence toward the optimal solution
within the searching space. The Metropolis criterion distinguishes
SA from deterministic optimization algorithms,
in which the
improvement
is always accepted and deterioration is always
rejected.

PThe block diagram shown in Fig. 16 gives an exemplar implemen-
tation of the SA algorithm, which is detailed in [298]. Before the
algorithm starts, the lower and upper bounds for the flow parame-
ters, i.e. T and X, are estimated. For better computational efficiency, a
database a of absorption coefficients for the chosen transition are
pre-calculated for the flow parameters delimited by the bounds. The
tomographic inversion process follows these two pre-processing
steps and mainly consists of three computational loops. In the inner-
*
most loop (Loop 1), one variable of x

The loop cycles through all the variables sequentially and is repeated
for NS times by the middle loop (Loop 2). The step lengths (the mag-
nitude of x* variations) are then optimized according to the accep-
tance rate [298]. The outermost loop (Loop 3) then repeats the
middle loop for NT times. If the convergence criterion is met after
completion of the three nested loops, the algorithm will be termi-
nated; otherwise the temperature TSA is reduced (TSA D TSA £ ξ,
where 0 (cid:3) ξ (cid:3) 1) and the loops are iterated until the termination cri-
terion is satisfied. The termination criterion can be set, e.g., as the
relative improvement in Fopt between the last two, or even more,
consecutive temperature states (TSA). The higher the thermal pertur-
bation, the more iterations the algorithms will go through, the
annealing rate slows down as (ξ ! 1), and the more likely the opti-
mal solution can be located; however this comes at the cost of

Pincreased computational time. It can be inferred from the optimiza-
tion process that the number of function evaluations will increase as
the discretization grid becomes more finely spaced. Since the
computational cost for each function evaluation also increases with
pixel number, the computational cost increases exponentially with
the size of the nonlinear tomographic inversion problem. It has been
shown in [108] that the performance of ABNT will first improve and
then deteriorate as the meshing scale increases.

P3.2.2. Determination of the regularization factors

PAs introduced in the previous sections, one of the advantages of
nonlinear tomography is that additional flow information can easily
be accommodated in the cost function. For example, the smoothness
conditions for temperature and species concentration profiles can be
integrated in the cost function, via inclusion of regularization terms
as shown in Eqs. (3.4) and (3.13). However, the regularization fac-
tors, which control the relative strengths of the posterior and a priori
information have to be determined properly, so that a good approxi-
mation of the optimal solution can be obtained. For example, if the
regularization factors are larger than optimal, then the final solution
will be over-smoothed; in the opposite case, the smoothness condi-
tions will not be satisfied. The method of choosing appropriate regu-
larization factors was systematically investigated through numerical

Psimulations in Ref. [306]. In the study, H2O was assumed to be the
target species, and phantoms of T and X were created to mimic mul-
timodal and asymmetric distributions as are typically encountered
in practical combustion devices (Fig. 17(a)). The ROI was meshed
into 10 £ 10 square pixels. The simulations were performed for ten
absorption transitions measured with two orthogonal projections,
over ten LOS measurement locations. To quantify the reconstruction
quality, the normalized temperature and concentration errors eT and
eX were defined as

where superscripts distinguish between the phantoms as the ground

PAs discussed earlier in Section 3.1.1, the temperature affects the
lineshapes of the absorption features and the species concentration
has a major impact on the magnitude of the absorbance. Due to their
distinct signal responses, the profiles of temperature and concentra-
tion can be recovered in two separate steps. As demonstrated in Ref.
[306], a faithful reconstruction of the temperature profile is achieved
by optimizing Eq. (3.4), regardless of the quality of the concentration
reconstruction. This is shown in Fig. 17(b) (squares), which was

Pobtained when the regularization parameter g X is set to 0, i.e. no
smoothness condition is applied for the spatial concentration distri-
bution. The triangles represent the cases for g X D 1 £ 108g T. Good
performance is evident for g T spanning multiple orders of magni-
tude for both settings of g X. At a certain g T, both D and RT, as defined
in Eq. (3.13) contribute equally to the regularized cost function as
shown in both Fig. 18(a) and (b). In this case, good solutions were
obtained. Sensitivity analyses of this type can be used to provide
guidelines for the selection of values for g T.

with a dimension of 200 £ 100 (20 beams, 10λ0s, and 10 £ 10 pixels),
which contains the calculated absorbance values for a pure absorb-
ing gas at each transition line within each individual pixel that is
covered by each LOS measurement using the obtained Trec. Eq. (3.16)

can be solved via least-squares minimization to yield X
. However,
the S matrix is usually ill-conditioned, i.e. with a large condition
number, and the solution of Eq. (3.16) is therefore usually compro-
mised by noise. A linear regularization technique is necessary to alle-
viate the rank-deficiency of Eq. (3.16). The regularized version of Eq.
(3.16) is defined as follows:

where the k (cid:6) k notation represents the Euclidean norm of a vector, L
again is a regularization operator realized in a matrix format, and g
is the corresponding regularization factor that controls the relative
strengths of the two terms in Eq. (3.17). This regularization method
is well-established and has been studied extensively [307(cid:1)310]. The
so-called L-curve method described in Ref. [308] can be applied to
determine the optimal g for a valid solution of the concentration dis-
tribution.

Pwhere Tr is the trace of the matrix. A good choice of g, according to
Eq. (3.18), results in the residual and regularization factor to become
comparable in magnitude [311]. Then, a range, centered at g0, is
determined to vary g. The corresponding values of g around the cor-
ner are labelled on the plot and, as Fig. 19(b) demonstrates, these
values of g indeed yield a small eX. In this example, the minimum eX
(4.9%) occurs at a g of »1 £ 10¡4, which is very close to the turning
point of the corner. As demonstrated in Ref. [120], this method yields
a stable and accurate reconstruction of X.

P3.2.3. Selection of the optimal transition lines

PIn both DAS- and CFWMS-based tomography, multiple absorp-
tion transitions are used in the tomographic reconstruction. The
selection of the optimal set of absorption transitions that can be cov-
ered by the laser sources are extremely important since their sensi-
tivity and response to variations in temperature and species
concentration vary greatly, which can significantly affect the recon-
struction quality. The method of selecting the optimal set of transi-
tions is detailed in Ref. [312] and is only briefly summarized here. In
[263], a limited number of promising candidate transitions were
pre-selected (only 15 were used in the demonstration to reduce the
computational cost) according to criteria widely used in two-line
thermometry methods with a view to maximize the temperature
sensitivity of the LOS measurements. The details of the pre-selection
can be found in Ref. [287]. The candidate transitions were then
tested to solve the two-zone problems based on the hypothesis that
if a set of transitions is optimal for a specific two-zone field, it should
also be optimal for a general non-uniform field distribution. It has to
be noted that for a two-zone problem, the absorption measurement

PThe method involves the solution of Eq. (3.17) at different values
of g and the calculation of the corresponding residual (the left term in
Eq. (3.17)), and the regularization term k H ¢ X* k . When the two
terms are plotted against each other, an L-shape curve is obtained as
exemplified in Fig. 19(a). The optimal regularization factor is then
determined by locating the position near the corner of the curve, which
has the maximum curvature. In this example, a gT of 10¡10 and a gX of
10¡2 were used in a first step to obtain the Trec, corresponding to an eT
of 1.44%. After the S matrix is evaluated using this Trec obtained, Eq.
(3.17) is solved for various values of g, ranging from, g D 10¡9 to 103.
The range of g is suggested by the following quantity:

and X can be recovered for both, as demonstrated in Fig. 20(a) and

cess is then repeated until the desired resolution is achieved. The

sentative two-zone problems. Each subset is used to solve the prob-
lem repeatedly and the worst case featuring the maximal DT

were compared to those of a non-optimal set for various representa-

sions were drawn for all examples. Hence, here we only reproduce
one such example from [312] in Fig. 23. It clearly shows that the
optimal transition set outperforms the non-optimal set.

reaching MHz repetition rates, can be realized for tomographic
measurements. But the associated high cost for the tomographic

PIn the demonstration, all possible combinations of 4 out of the 15
pre-selected transitions were used to solve five basic two-zone prob-
lems. An artificial Gaussian noise of 1% (relative) was added to the
LOS measurements to simulate experimental conditions. The DT's of
each combination were calculated according to Eq. (3.21) and the
maximum DTmax recorded. The overall DTmax was then obtained by
summing up the DTmax obtained from each individual two-zone
problem. The temperature error eT obtained using each combination
is plotted in Fig. 21 with DTmax arranged in an ascending order, so
that the correlation between eT and DTmax can be easily observed.
The best 50 combinations feature a consistently smaller eT and vari-
ance than the worst 50 combinations, which proves the validity of

reconstructions is often intractable. On the other hand, reactive
flows can often be approximated to be smooth in the temporal
domain, such that there is a correlation between consecutive
measurement frames. This can be taken advantage of to reduce
the size of the optimization problem, i.e. the number of varia-
bles, and hence the computational complexity is decreased. Even
dynamic events, such as flame lift off and blow out, often occur
on the ms timescale, and can be sampled frequently during their
occurrence, such that flow properties are nearly unchanged
within a grid element between consecutive frames. The over-
arching criterion is that the sampling rate exceeds the rate of
change of flow properties to a significant degree. The tool that

PThe major advantages of using the POD method are three-fold: 1)
regularization is not needed since the extracted eigenfunctions are
smooth; 2) better reconstructions can be obtained since the scale of
the optimization problem is reduced and also the control of the bounds
is improved; and 3) the application of POD also improves the noise-
immunity of the tomographic inversion, as discussed in Ref. [305].

3.3. Experimental demonstration and applications

P3.3.1. Wavelength-swept lasers

PTheoretically, any lasers with sufficiently narrow line-width for
gas sensing can be used for absorption tomography as long as it can
be wavelength-tuned to cover a good number of absorption features
of the target flow species. However, for certain reactive flows, such
as turbulent flames, a high temporal resolution is necessary to freeze
the flow and track transient phenomena. Thus, wavelength-swept
lasers with high tuning agility are desirable for these applications.
Rapid wavelength tuning can be realized by either extra- or intra-
cavity filtering, depending on where the wavelength selection takes
place. In the former case, the wavelength-selective element, e.g. a
dispersing fiber, is positioned outside of the cavity and wavelength
sweeping takes place after broadband laser radiation is generated. In
the other case, the wavelength-selective element is contained inside
the laser cavity so that only a certain wavelength is amplified during
the lasing process. The wavelength agile lasers that have been suc-
cessfully used, or have the potential to be used, for DAS-based non-
linear tomography are illustrated in Fig. 24 and are briefly
introduced in the following sections.

PPanel (a) of Fig. 24 shows a standard fiber-ring swept wavelength
laser, which contains a fiber Fabry-Perot tunable filter (FFP-TF)
within the ring cavity. The gain medium is a semiconductor optical
amplifier (SOA) sandwiched between two optical isolators to sup-
press reflections from optical surfaces and to guarantee a unidirec-
tional propagation of the photons. Through amplified spontaneous
emission, the SOA starts to emit broadband radiation which is then
spectrally filtered by the FFP-TF. The filtered radiation will then be
amplified through stimulated emission (SE) after multiple round-
trips within the cavity, until the active medium is saturated. The out-
put wavelength can be tuned via the waveform driver, which tunes
the FFP-TF to sweep through the gain window of the SOA. The
sweeping rate of the laser is limited by the rate of slow lasing pro-
cesses, i.e. ASE [313]. To overcome this limitation, a new design of
the ring cavity was recently proposed, as illustrated in Panel (b). The
new design incorporates a delay line, so called dispersion compensa-
tion module (DCM), within the cavity so that some photons remain
in the cavity to act as seeds for the SE processes of following sweeps.
The driving frequency of the filter must match the delay time of the
stored sweep in the delay line so that the correct seeding wave-
lengths pass the filter at the correct time to be amplified by the SE
processes. This conceptually simple modification greatly reduces the
lasing buildup time and thus increases the achievable sweeping rate
dramatically. Theoretically, the sweeping rate of the laser is only
limited by the SOA carrier relaxation time, which is typically below a
nanosecond. In addition, the spectral range of the laser is limited by
the gain window of the SOA, which usually spans tens of nano-
meters. Since the frequency or spectral information is transformed
into temporal information through wavelength chirping, the device
is named Fourier domain mode locking (FDML) laser [283(cid:1)285,314].
PSupercontinuum radiation is another type of spatially coherent
broad bandwidth radiation, which can be rapidly wavelength tuned
outside of the laser cavity as depicted in Panel (c). Octave spanning
supercontinuum radiation is generated by pumping short (ps or
shorter) pulses into a photonic crystal fiber [25] where nonlinear
effects such as self-phase modulation, stimulated Raman scattering,
and four-wave mixing lead to massive spectral broadening
[265,315]. The color spectrum of the ensuing broad bandwidth

pensation module (DCM) for spectral dispersion.

Pcan be employed to exploit temporal correlations is again the
POD technique, which was briefly introduced in Section 2.2.5
and is also detailed in Ref. [305].

PIn difference to CAT, in which the training functions are the dis-
tributions of the absorption coefficients, the counterpart in DAS-
based nonlinear tomography are the T and X distributions obtained
from previous measurements or numerical simulations. By perform-
ing POD, the eigenfunctions for both T and X can be obtained. A frac-
tion of the eigenvectors with the largest eigenvalues can be used to
predict the reconstructions. The mathematical expression for this
step is defined as

where F*
k are the eigenfunctions, zk represents the weighting fac-
tors, T * is the temperature distribution arranged in a vector format,
and K is the total number of eigenfunctions used in the representa-
tion. The X distribution can be reproduced in a similar way. When
the approximations of T and X are substituted into Eq. (3.4), the cost
function, F, becomes a function of the weighting factors instead of T
and X on each grid point. Since the number of weighting factors (K)
is significantly less than that of the grid elements, the scale of the
optimization problem can be greatly reduced. The POD approxima-
tion greatly reduces the number of variables in the problem with an
associated reduction in the computational cost proportional to N2/K,
where N2 is the number of elements in the ROI.

Ppulses is temporally dispersed via passage through a long dispersive
fiber. A spectrum is then recorded for each pulse simply by recording
the time resolved signal on a high bandwidth photo-detector and
sweep rates of up to 1 nm per ns are possible, beyond which the
spectral resolution becomes limited by the Heisenberg uncertainty
principle [265]. Detailed implementations of this ultra-fast wave-
length-sweeping technique are covered in [22,24,264].

P3.3.2. Experimental applications

PHigh-speed tomographic imaging has found a range of applica-
tions in the combustion area, e.g. the development of next-genera-
tion engines such as the Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition
and scramjet engines. The DAS-based nonlinear tomography, on the
other hand, has so far been experimentally validated with a two-
zone problem [316], and demonstrated on a Hencken burner [119]
and a gas turbine engine [239].

PHere we summarize the most recent application of DAS-based
nonlinear tomography for flow measurements at the exhaust plane
of the augmenter-equipped J85-GE-5 gas turbine engine as an exam-
ple [239]. The tomographic sensor consisted of three synchronized
FDML lasers covering different regions in the near-infrared spec-
trum. The outputs from the lasers were combined and split into 32
beams using an optical multiplexer. A total of 30 laser beams were
used to probe the ROI, with 15 arranged horizontally and 15 verti-
cally as shown in Panel (a) of Fig. 25. The remaining two beams were
monitored to provide references for the laser intensity and wave-
length scan, respectively. The probing beams were installed on a

taken at a repetition rate of 50 kHz and measured projection data

only two orthogonal projections were used in this application, there
is no limitation per se in the number of projections that can be
accommodated by DAS-based nonlinear tomography. Both the spa-
tial resolution and accuracy will be improved, as more projections
are used. The reader is referred to Ref. [239] for more details.

4. Conclusions

PTomographic absorption spectroscopy (TAS) is evolving into a
mature technique in studies of gas dynamics and reactive flows. It is
capable of mapping major non-fluorescent flow species such as H2O,
CO2 and hydrocarbons with high sensitivity and speed. Examples
include the successful demonstration on multi-cylinder and single-
cylinder automotive engines for hydrocarbon imaging with crank-
angle resolved temporal resolution. This imaging capacity makes it a
perfect complement to planar imaging techniques such as laser-
induced fluorescence. The latter usually provide better temporal and
spatial resolution compared to tomographic absorption methods,

Pbased nonlinear tomography can effectively take advantage of the
spectral sampling and CFWMS-based nonlinear tomography further
extends the tomographic sampling into the harmonic domain, using
the wavelength modulation method.

PTo summarize, this paper has reviewed the definition, mathemat-
ical formulation, inversion algorithms, and experimental demonstra-
tions as well as applications of both CAT and ABNT for practical
flow tomography. Tomographic absorption spectroscopy is comple-
mentary to planar imaging techniques and has been experimentally
demonstrated with minimal optical access for engine measure-
ments. Recent progress in ABNT is set to extend the applicability of
CAT to more difficult combustion scenarios, such as coal-fired power
plant boilers filled with flying ashes and in-flight engine monitoring
in the presence of severe vibration, etc. We note though, that ABNT
is still in its early days and work has so far been mostly theoretical in
nature. Important topics such as spatial resolution and sensitivity
offer scope for future numerical and experimental investigation.
However, the many potential advantages of the technique hold great
promise for the future and we hope that this review serves as a
pointer into new directions along which the field will develop. Full
scale experimental demonstrations and practical applications are
bound to follow in the near future. In addition, the theory of nonlin-
ear tomography is a new mathematical approach for data processing
quite generally, which can potentially be applied to other tomo-
graphic areas, such as ultrasonic tomography [317], electrical resis-
tance tomography [318], electrical impedance tomography [26], and
interferometric tomography [319]. Finally, we point out again that
tomographic absorption spectroscopy quite generally, whether lin-
ear or not, is not limited to reconstructions in 2 dimensions. There
are interesting new developments in so called imaging Fourier trans-
form spectroscopy [320] which may enable volumetric absorption
tomography in the future and proof of concept numerical studies are
being conducted to explore the viability of this concept [108].

schemes. CAT: classical absorption tomography; CFWMS: calibration-free wavelength
modulation spectroscopy; DAS: direct absorption spectroscopy; NT: nonlinear tomog-
raphy.

Phowever they are restricted to situations where optical access is
abundant and to the detection of fluorescent species, which makes
them impractical in many technical combustion environments. The
field is likely to see enormous developments in the near future
through recent progress in the technology of broadband sweeping
lasers, detector technologies, advancing absorption spectroscopy
modalities, and in the theory of nonlinear tomography, bringing
new opportunities for TAS to be deployed for combustion diagnos-
tics. For example, the advent of high-repetition rate, octave-span-
ning supercontinuum sources makes the simultaneous imaging of
multiple flame species possible. The establishment of nonlinear
tomography enables the incorporation of multispectral information
within a single tomographic inversion, something that is not possi-
Its realization also brings other
ble with classical tomography.
advantages, such as an enhanced immunity against experimental
noise. Furthermore nonlinear tomography enables a combination
with wavelength modulation spectroscopy, which is calibration free
and features high sensitivity.

PThe conceptual difference between classical absorption tomogra-
phy (CAT) and absorption-based nonlinear tomography (ABNT) is
not the number of absorption transitions that are used in a measure-
ment but the way in which the measured data are processed. For
example, multiple wavelengths can also be used in CAT but the sino-
grams are processed sequentially one by one to recover the distribu-
tion of absorption coefficients for a specific transition. In ABNT, on
the other hand, the projection data for all transitions are assembled
into one sinogram and processed simultaneously in a single tomo-
graphic inversion. In other words, the sinogram for nonlinear tomog-
raphy has higher dimensionality (i.e. spectral dimensions) than the
classical case. Furthermore, in ABNT the distributions of tempera-
ture, species, and pressure are reconstructed directly without prior
recovery of the spatial profiles of absorption coefficients. We point
out also that the ABNT is not inherently limited in spatial resolution;
it achieves the same level of spatial resolution as CAT for the same
number of projections but, as mentioned earlier, enjoys better noise
immunity. However, in cases with extremely limited optical access,
ABNT provides useful data already from only two orthogonal projec-
tions, which is not possible with CAT.

PFig. 26 summarizes all the tomographic absorption techniques
that have been either numerically or experimentally demonstrated,
in terms of optimal sampling schemes. The sampling in spatial, tem-
poral, and harmonic dimensions is represented by three axes,
respectively. The distance along each axis indicates the intensive-
ness of the sampling in the corresponding dimension. As can be
seen, CAT is in the plane z-O-x and samples the spatial dimension
intensively at only one specific absorption transition. With the aid of
nonlinear tomography, the sampling in the other two dimensions
can be accommodated in the inversion process. For example, DAS-
