    "question_text": "According to the provided paper content, what is the role of microstructure in CO₂ transport membranes (CO₂ TMs) and how is it mathematically incorporated into the flux equations? Specifically, what microstructural parameters are explicitly mentioned in the paper's flux equations for MOCC membranes, and what is the stated relationship between these parameters and CO₂ permeation flux?",
    "standard_answer": "The paper states that microstructure plays a critical role in CO₂ transport membranes by determining the transport pathways for ionic species. For MOCC membranes specifically, the paper explicitly mentions that 'a microstructure-corrected Wagner flux equation is derived' which incorporates porosity (ε) and tortuosity (τ) as key microstructural parameters. The flux equation shows that CO₂ permeation flux (J_CO₂) is directly proportional to the ratio of porosity to tortuosity (ε/τ) in the membrane structure. This mathematical relationship indicates that higher porosity and lower tortuosity enhance CO₂ permeation flux by providing more continuous and direct pathways for ionic transport through the molten carbonate phase. The paper further explains that 'the microstructure of the solid matrix' must be optimized to achieve dense membranes with good wettability between the solid matrix and molten carbonate phase, which is essential for forming continuous ionic networks that maximize CO₂ transport efficiency.",
    "original_text": {
      "1": "For MOCC membranes, assuming homogeneous distribution of MC within solid matrix and the local chemical equilibrium CO₂ + O²⁻ = CO₃²⁻, a microstructure-corrected Wagner flux equation is derived to describe the relationship between CO₂ permeation flux (J_CO₂) and CO₂ partial pressure (p_CO₂) as follows.",
      "2": "The microstructure of the solid matrix in CO₂ TMs is microstructurally dense. Based on the charge carriers of the solid material, CO₂ TM can be grouped into three categories: (1) mixed oxide-ionic and carbonate-ionic conductor (MOCC) membrane, (2) mixed electronic and carbonate-ionic conductor (MECC) membrane, and (3) mixed electronic, oxide-ionic and carbonate-ionic conductor (MEOCC) membrane."
