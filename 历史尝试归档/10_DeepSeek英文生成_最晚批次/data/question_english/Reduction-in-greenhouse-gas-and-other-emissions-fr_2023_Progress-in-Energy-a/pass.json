    "question_text": "Calculate the theoretical SO2 emission rate in g/kWh for a marine engine burning fuel with 2.5% sulfur content, assuming complete conversion of fuel sulfur to SO2, and explain how this changes with scrubber efficiency.",
    "standard_answer": "To calculate SO2 emissions, start with the fuel's sulfur content and energy basis. For marine fuels, typical lower heating value (LHV) is ~42 MJ/kg. Sulfur mass fraction: 2.5% = 0.025 kg S/kg fuel. Upon combustion, S + O2 → SO2, so molecular weights: S (32 g/mol) to SO2 (64 g/mol), giving a conversion factor of 64/32 = 2. Thus, SO2 produced per kg fuel = 0.025 kg S/kg fuel × 2 = 0.05 kg SO2/kg fuel. Energy input per kg fuel = 42 MJ. SO2 emission per MJ = 0.05 kg / 42 MJ = 0.00119 kg/MJ = 1.19 g/MJ. Convert to g/kWh: 1 kWh = 3.6 MJ, so SO2 = 1.19 g/MJ × 3.6 MJ/kWh = 4.28 g/kWh. This is the engine-out emission without control. With a scrubber of efficiency η (e.g., 99%), post-scrubber SO2 = 4.28 × (1 - η) g/kWh. For η=0.99, SO2 = 0.0428 g/kWh, demonstrating scrubbers' effectiveness even with high-sulfur fuels.",

    "question_text": "How does the NOx/PM trade-off manifest in marine diesel engines, and what are the underlying combustion mechanisms that cause this inverse relationship?",
    "standard_answer": "The NOx/PM trade-off in marine diesel engines arises from competing chemical and physical processes during combustion. NOx formation is primarily thermal, occurring at high temperatures (>1800K) through the Zeldovich mechanism where N2 and O2 from intake air react to form NO. Higher combustion temperatures and oxygen availability favor NOx production. Conversely, particulate matter (PM), especially black carbon (BC), forms under fuel-rich conditions during the diffusion combustion phase where incomplete combustion leads to soot nucleation and growth. When engine parameters are adjusted to reduce NOx (e.g., delayed injection timing, exhaust gas recirculation), combustion temperatures decrease, reducing NOx but extending the fuel-rich zones and residence time for soot formation, increasing PM emissions. This trade-off is quantified in engine tuning: higher compression ratios and advanced injection raise temperatures, increasing NOx but enhancing soot oxidation, while EGR reduces oxygen and peak temperatures, cutting NOx but elevating PM due to reduced oxidation rates. The inverse relationship is inherent in conventional diesel combustion, though technologies like turbocharging and electronic control can mitigate it by optimizing air-fuel mixing.",
    "original_text": {
      "1": "This physical phenomenon is known as the NOx/PM trade-off, or rather the NOx/BC trade-off since other constituents of PM (e.g., organics, sulphates, metals) do not necessarily follow this principle.",
      "2": "EGR is an internal technology of an engine to reduce NOx emissions by mixing a part of the exhaust gas into the intake combustion air to reduce the oxygen availability and increase the water and CO2 concentration in the intake air, which suppresses combustion temperatures and hence, NOx formation. On the other hand, EGR tends to increase PM emissions."

    "standard_answer": "The paper states that carbon-neutral fuels are typically sulphur-free, which enables negligible SOx emissions and facilitates the use of efficient exhaust aftertreatment technologies like particle filtration. This sulphur-free characteristic eliminates one of the major barriers to implementing advanced emission control systems in marine engines. Additionally, the paper notes that HVO consists of paraffins (alkanes) and has a very high cetane number and high quality sufficient for road transport, with similar paraffinic fuels produced through biomass gasification followed by Fischer-Tropsch liquefaction to produce BTL fuel. The combination of these properties in carbon-neutral drop-in fuels allows for effective emission control while maintaining compatibility with existing marine engine infrastructure, supporting the transition toward near-zero emission shipping through the integration of fuel properties and aftertreatment technologies.",

    "standard_answer": "According to the paper, N2O emissions from ammonia combustion in marine engines present significant environmental challenges. The combustion of NH3 produces N2O, which has a high global warming potential (GWP100) of 265, making it a potent greenhouse gas. Additionally, N2O emissions contribute to depleting the stratospheric ozone layer, and its role as an anthropogenic contributor is increasing along with decreasing halocarbon emissions. When considering NH3 as fuel for internal combustion engines, exhaust emission control to remove N2O is essential. The paper emphasizes that harmful exhaust emissions, including N2O, need to be removed using emission control achieved by fuel, engine, or exhaust aftertreatment technologies. While the paper doesn't specify particular N2O removal technologies, it highlights that carbon-neutral fuels combined with efficient emission control technologies would enable (near-)zero-emission shipping. The environmental impact of N2O is particularly concerning given its dual role in both global warming and ozone depletion, necessitating comprehensive emission control strategies for ammonia-fueled marine engines.",

The paper states that 'SOx scrubbers enable low SOx emissions even with high-sulphur residual fuels' and that 'scrubbers on-board have demonstrated the potential of SO2 emissions at a very low level, for example, 0.07 g/kWh using fuel with a sulfur content of 1.9 wt% and generally lower SOx emissions than when using fuel of 0.1wt% sulphur content.' Different scrubber types include fresh water (closed loop), seawater (open loop), and hybrid systems, which provide flexibility in operation. Performance is influenced by the scrubbing medium and system design, with hybrid systems allowing adaptation to different water types. Compared to low-sulfur fuels, scrubbers allow continued use of high-sulfur fuels while meeting emission standards, but require energy for operation and may have discharge considerations. The choice between scrubbers and low-sulfur fuels depends on operational routes, fuel availability, and regulatory compliance, with scrubbers offering a retrofit solution for existing ships to reduce SOx emissions effectively.",
