    "standard_answer": "The paper identifies two primary mechanisms through which heat release modifies turbulence structure and dynamics at highly turbulent conditions. First, thermochemical gradients generated by combustion chemistry influence turbulence through altered transport properties and thermal expansion effects. As stated: 'Thermochemical gradients generated by combustion chemistry also influence the turbulence, both by altering transport properties and through thermal expansion (e.g., flow divergence, density gradients, etc.).' Second, the turbulent flow itself is fundamentally affected by heat release, resulting in differences compared to classical non-reacting turbulence: 'At the same time, the turbulent flow itself is affected by heat release from the flame, resulting in differences compared to classical non-reacting turbulence and to turbulence in flames at lower intensities.' These mechanisms manifest in specific ways across turbulence quantities. For turbulence kinetic energy, heat release affects the energy budget through thermal expansion-induced flow acceleration and density variations that modify production and dissipation terms. The paper explicitly addresses this through the question: 'How are turbulence structure and dynamics modified by premixed flames at highly turbulent conditions? in terms of fluxes, spectra, kinetic energy, and other relevant quantities.' For turbulent stresses, the modifications occur through altered velocity correlations and pressure-strain interactions due to density gradients and thermal expansion. Regarding spectral characteristics, heat release affects both structure and dynamics across different scales, with energy transfers modified by combustion-induced flow acceleration and scalar-turbulence interactions. The multi-scale nature of these modifications is captured in the paper's discussion of spectral and multi-scale characteristics of turbulence in reacting flows, where heat release alters both the spectral distribution of energy and the dynamics of energy transfer between scales.",
