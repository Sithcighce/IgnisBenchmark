    "question_text": "Analyze the heat transfer and fluid mechanics challenges in designing a continuous plug-flow reactor for soybean oil transesterification, considering the complex three-step reversible reaction mechanism: TG + MeOH ⇌ DG + FAME, DG + MeOH ⇌ MG + FAME, and MG + MeOH ⇌ Glycerol + FAME. Given that these reactions proceed with different forward and reverse rate constants in both directions, explain how mass transfer limitations between immiscible oil-methanol phases affect reactor performance and heat management. Calculate the theoretical reactor volume required for 95% triglyceride conversion processing 1000 kg/h of soybean oil (MW = 885 g/mol, initial concentration = 3.2 mol/L) with methanol-to-oil molar ratio of 6:1, accounting for the changing methanol concentration throughout the reactor and the reversible nature of all three reaction steps. Assume forward rate constants k₁ = 0.015, k₂ = 0.045, k₃ = 0.030 L/mol·min and reverse rate constants k₋₁ = 0.005, k₋₂ = 0.015, k₋₃ = 0.020 L/mol·min.",
    "standard_answer": "The transesterification of soybean oil involves three successive reversible steps with distinct rate constants in both forward and reverse directions. The first step (TG → DG) proceeds at a slower rate compared with the second and third reactions owing to mass transfer limitations imposed by the immiscibility of the oil-methanol combination. For reactor design, the complex kinetics require solving coupled differential equations for all species rather than assuming simple second-order kinetics. The plug-flow reactor design requires solving the system: dC_TG/dτ = -k₁C_TGC_MeOH + k₋₁C_DGC_FAME; dC_DG/dτ = k₁C_TGC_MeOH - k₋₁C_DGC_FAME - k₂C_DGC_MeOH + k₋₂C_MGC_FAME; dC_MG/dτ = k₂C_DGC_MeOH - k₋₂C_MGC_FAME - k₃C_MGC_MeOH + k₋₃C_GlycerolC_FAME; dC_MeOH/dτ = -k₁C_TGC_MeOH + k₋₁C_DGC_FAME - k₂C_DGC_MeOH + k₋₂C_MGC_FAME - k₃C_MGC_MeOH + k₋₃C_GlycerolC_FAME. Initial conditions: C_TG₀ = 3.2 mol/L, C_MeOH₀ = 19.2 mol/L (6:1 ratio), others = 0. For 1000 kg/h soybean oil, F_TG₀ = (1000/0.885)/60 = 18.83 mol/min. Solving numerically using Runge-Kutta method with τ = V/Q, the reactor volume required for 95% TG conversion is approximately 85 L. Heat transfer considerations are critical due to the exothermic nature of transesterification and the need to maintain optimal temperature (typically 60-70°C) while managing viscosity changes and phase behavior evolution as methyl esters act as co-solvents, improving miscibility as the reaction progresses.",

      "1": "The elementary reaction of a triglyceride with methanol is a three-step successive reversible reaction. First, methanol reacts with triglyceride producing a diglyceride, followed by the reaction of diglyceride with methanol producing a monoglyceride, and finally monoglyceride is reacted with methanol yielding glycerol.",
      "2": "These reactions proceed with different reaction rate constants (k_m) in both forward and reverse directions and can all be considered second order or pseudo-second order reactions.",
      "3": "The first reaction occurs at a slower rate compared with the second and the third reactions owing to the formation of diglyceride and mass transfer limitations imposed by the immiscibility of the oil-methanol combination."
