This article offers a comprehensive overview of research on fuel reforming in internal combustion engines (ICE). It
includes a historical perspective of research in this field, a discussion on the considerations to be made prior to choosing
a primary fuel for reforming purposes, and the main processes in fuel reforming. Steam reforming offers a moderate
degree of thermochemical recuperation and is applicable to methanol and ethanol feeding. Reforming with air reduces
the degree of recuperation, but opens up the use of heavier fuels such as gasoline and diesel fuel. Dry reforming (with
CO2) offers the best recuperation but is prone to fast coking. The choice of catalyst and the expected side reactions for
each fuel are also discussed. While there is extensive literature on steam reforming catalysts and kinetics at atmo-
spheric pressure, studies at higher pressures and/or on decomposition reactions are very few. The thermodynamics of
fuel reforming in ICE and simulation approaches are also discussed. The paper also reports on engineering aspects of
fuel reformer design and provides an overview of engines with thermo-chemical recuperation (TCR), fuel supply, and
load control strategies in ICE with TCR. In-cylinder fuel reforming as well as application of fuel reforming for perfor-
mance improvement of emission aftertreatment systems are subsequently discussed. This overview reveals ongoing
diverse research activities in the field of onboard fuel reforming. However, several problems, including reformate burn-
ing velocity at typical for ICE conditions, in-cylinder behavior of directly injected reformates and particle formation still
need to be addressed. A discussion on some of these unresolved issues is attempted herein.

1. Introduction

1.1. Required improvement of energy efficiency and emission
mitigation

PTransportation is responsible for the majority of global fuel con-
sumption. According to the data from the International Energy
Agency (IEA) [1], about 26% of all energy-related CO2 emissions in
2007 were caused by transportation. This value is likely to increase
in future unless special measures are adopted. Following the recom-
mendation of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Cli-
mate Change (IPCC), by 2050, the annual global greenhouse gas
(GHG) emissions must be reduced by 50 - 85% of the emission levels
recorded in 2000. This will result in limiting the long-term global
heating to 2.0 - 2.4 deg. C [2]. However, more recent studies have
indicated that climate change is occurring faster than previously
expected and that even a 50% reduction in global GHG emissions by
2050 may not be enough [3].

PIn 2006, road transportation was responsible for about three-
quarters of the global energy consumption in the transportation seg-
ment [4]. In Europe this number is even higher and reached 82.5% in
2009 [5]. Nowadays, road transportation is almost entirely depen-
dent (» 95%) on crude oil [6]. Therefore, to meet GHG emission tar-
gets and decrease oil dependency, the overall energy consumption
of road vehicles must be significantly reduced. The major challenge
in reaching this goal is to reduce vehicle carbon emissions without
disrupting transportation patterns and population mobility.

PAccording to the World Business Council for Sustainable Devel-
opment (WBSCD), the vehicle GHG intensity is determined from the
following factors [7]:

P1) The amount of energy required by an average vehicle to perform
a given amount of transport activity in each transportation
mode. This factor depends on the energy consumption of the
vehicle.

P2) The carbon content of the used fuel together with its production

and distribution methods.

P3) The total volume of transportation activity, which is dependent
on the number of operating vehicles and their usage patterns.
This is a function of consumer demand.

P4) The modal composition of transportation activity, which is
dependent on consumer choice, mode pricing, and fiscal meas-
ures that influence mode selection.

PThe first two modes have the biggest impact on vehicle GHG
intensity. According to the IEA, 80% of the necessary reduction in
GHG emissions can be achieved by improving vehicle energy effi-
ciency and fuel decarbonization. This provides a strong incentive for
research and development of new technologies based on alternative
energy sources and energy carriers [8].

1.2. Thermochemical recuperation as a method of simultaneous waste
heat recovery and hydrogen production

PIntensive research aimed at the development of internal combus-
tion engine (ICE)-based propulsion systems with 60% brake thermal
efficiency and ultra-low pollutant emissions is ongoing [9(cid:1)12].
There is wide consensus that waste heat recovery (WHR) is

Pnecessary in achieving this ambitious goal [12,13]. Various known
WHR methods, including turbocharging [14], turbo-compounding
[15], thermo-electrics [16], the Rankine cycle [17], in-cylinder WHR
[18], and cabin heating and cooling [19] are being developed at dif-
ferent rates of intensity. The most mature and widely applied WHR
method is turbocharging [8]. Waste heat can also be used to sustain
endothermic reactions of fuel reforming, a method often referred to
as thermochemical recuperation (TCR) [20]. TCR presents two major
advantages over turbocharging: firstly, the amount of utilized energy
is not limited by isentropic expansion and secondly, the gaseous
reforming product mixture (reformate) usually comprises a high
hydrogen content to afford increased flame velocity, wider flamma-
bility limits, and reduced combustion irreversibility [21]. Hence, TCR
improves the ICE efficiency because of the increased heating value of
the fuel as a result of WHR as well as lean burning options,
approaching the efficiency of an ideal Otto cycle and providing the
possibility of applying higher compression ratios.

PNotably, fuel reforming through TCR allows convenient vehicle
fueling with a liquid fuel, while the engine is fed by a gaseous H2-
rich reformate produced onboard. Thus, the major issues related to
H2 use as an alternative fuel, such as fueling infrastructure and H2
storage onboard a vehicle, are eliminated. The challenge of onboard
H2-storage is directly related to the physical properties of hydrogen:
a very low volumetric energy content (10.3 MJ/m3 at 1 bar or »
3000 MJ/m3 at 350 bar compared to 33,750 MJ/m3 for gasoline) and
extremely low boiling point (20 K). Fig. 1 compares various hydrogen
storage technologies with reference to conventional and some alter-
native liquid fuels. None of the H2 storage methods reach the volu-
metric energy densities of gasoline and other liquid fuels to provide
a vehicle driving range comparable to that afforded by conventional
and liquid alternative fuels.

PWide flammability limits and very low ignition energy of H2 pres-
ent storage safety concerns at limited ventilation conditions because
of the danger of explosive mixture formation that may cause severe
damage. However, this is partially compensated for by a very high
mass diffusivity of H2 (0.78 m¢10¡4/s), which is an order of magni-
tude higher than that of gasoline (0.07 m¢10¡4/s). Storage of syngas
(mainly hydrogen and carbon monoxide) has also proven to be prob-
lematic for the same reasons. The hazards of pure H2 and syngas
storage and transport hamper the commercialization and market
penetration of hydrogen- and syngas-fed engines. Taking this into
account, the production of H2 or H2-rich gaseous fuel by onboard
reforming of a liquid primary fuel with coincident WHR through TCR
is attracting much attention. To date, works in this area have been
reported by Dai et al. [22], He et al. [23], Ji et al. [24], Liao & Horng
[25], Li et al. [26], Sall et al. [27], Tartakovsky et al. [28], Nguyen
&Verhelst [29], among other.

PNowadays, TCR has been commercialized and is successfully used
in various stationary applications, including gas turbines in power
plants for distributed power generation [30(cid:1)33] and furnaces [34].
Fuel reforming is being broadly studied as an onboard hydrogen pro-
duction method for fuel cells. A comprehensive review of fuel
reformers for fuel cells was performed by Pettersson & Westerholm
[35]. Additionally, recent progress in this field was surveyed and
analyzed in detail in review articles by Alves et al. [36], Xu et al. [37],
Iulianelli et al. [38], Gur [39] and Timurkutluk et al. [40]. Proton-
exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells require pure hydrogen for their
efficient operation as even small traces of CO result in degradation of

Pfuel cell performance. CO poisons the anode reaction through prefer-
ential adsorption onto the platinum surface, thereby blocking active
sites [41]. To afford onboard pure H2 production, several research
groups have used membrane reformers to incorporate H2 separation
with selective Pd and Pd-alloy membranes. To supply the required
energy, Sheintuch et al. used auto-thermal membrane reformers
[42(cid:1)44] in which the reformer effluents are mixed with air and oxi-
dized in a catalytic reactor imbedded within the reformer. Compared
to the strict requirement of high-purity hydrogen in fuel cells, ICE is
much more flexible and can effectively burn different mixtures of
hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and other gases. This characteristic
greatly reduces the cost of energy produced from renewable fuels
[45]. Thus, for ICE applications, the reforming conditions should be
optimized to achieve a reformate composition that is favorable as an
ICE fuel.

PThis overview focuses on recent advances in fuel reforming in
internal combustion engines. The paper begins with a short histori-
cal retrospective (Section 2), followed by a discussion on the funda-
mentals of
reforming (Section 3) and reformer design
peculiarities (Section 4). ICEs with thermochemical recuperation,
including fuel reforming for exhaust aftertreatment purposes and
in-cylinder reforming are discussed in Sections 5-7. Section 8
focuses on considerations for fuel reforming in ICE. Finally, some
open questions and future research directions are summarized in
Section 9.

2. Historical retrospective

PInitial research in the field of onboard fuel reforming aimed at
hydrogen generation began in the United States in the late 1960 s
and was mainly directed towards reducing pollutant emissions from
spark-ignition engines [46]. Lee and Wimmer [46] were the first to
demonstrate that a fuel gas (the name they gave to the reformate),

Pwhich could be steam-reformed from a liquid fuel, exhibited better
lean burning behavior and produced lower emissions than propane
and methane. Various fuel reforming technologies were investigated
in the 1970 s and 1980 s, including steam reforming (SR), decompo-
sition (thermal dissociation), partial oxidation and exhaust gas fuel
reforming [47].

PMartin [48] was the first to consider a reformer and internal com-
bustion engine as a total energy conversion system. He attempted to
utilize waste heat from the engine to sustain the endothermic fuel
reforming reactions and suggested catalytic SR of gasoline at a tem-
perature of 893 K. Martin was also the first to theoretically predict
the possibility of engine efficiency improvement from the increase
in the reformate heating value and the possibility of pumping loss
reduction. The latter is due to the wide flammability limits of a
hydrogen-rich reformate. This makes the operation of an engine at
partial loads with wide-open throttle (WOT) possible, thereby pre-
cluding the necessity for charge throttling. The benefits of fuel
reforming are discussed below (Section 5).

PHouseman and Cerini [49] applied a gasoline partial oxidation
technique to produce hydrogen onboard an engine. They utilized
partial oxidation over a nickel-based catalyst. The developed
reformer exhibited a thermal efficiency of 78.5% (ratio of the net
enthalpy of combustion of the reforming products to the net
enthalpy of combustion of the primary fuel), corresponding to 96%
of the maximum theoretical value. The process afforded H2 and CO
yields of 21.6 and 23.6% vol, respectively. Houseman and Cerini were
the first to apply dual-fuel engine operation where the reformate
gas was added to the engine intake manifold together with the gaso-
line-air mixture.

PResearch activities on exhaust gas fuel reforming also began in
the 1970 s. Lindstr€om [50] proposed that 5(cid:1)50% of the engine
exhaust gases could be conveyed to a reformer where they could
mix with gasoline. He suggested that endothermic SR reactions, sus-
tained by the enthalpy, CO2 and steam content of the exhaust gases,
would afford a gaseous fuel comprising H2 and CO. Any additional
energy required to sustain the endothermic reactions of gasoline
reforming would be supplied by combustion of the gasoline or refor-
mate fraction.

[54,55], making efficient exhaust heat recovery possible. Petters-
son & Sjostrom [56] overviewed most of the research on metha-
nol reforming for ICEs conducted up to the early 1990 s. Finegold
[57] and Sakai et al. [58] even built cars with on-board methanol
decomposition and reported up to 40% increase in energy effi-
ciency compared to a gasoline-operated vehicle of similar type.
Brinkman and Stebar [59] pointed out that the increased effi-
ciency was a result of the beneficial properties of the H2-rich
methanol reforming products, such as higher burning velocity
and wider flammability limits, compared to gasoline. The main
problems reported in these early studies were backfire and pre-
ignition, coke formation on the reformer catalyst, cold start diffi-
culties, engine power loss due to reduced air charging, and form-
aldehyde
liquid methanol
combustion). A few years later, in 1994, Jamal & Wyszynski [60]
reviewed the use of H2 and H2-enriched gasoline as fuels for SI
engines. They also analyzed the techniques used to generate H2
from liquid fuels such as gasoline and methanol on-board a vehi-

3.1. Chemical reactions of fuel reforming

PAs previously mentioned, catalytic fuel reforming is normally
performed to produce a hydrogen-rich reformate. Chemical reac-
tions taking place in this complex process are influenced by many
factors that include both engineering choices and physical condi-
tions.

PThe selection of a primary fuel is very important for any engine,
more so for an ICE with TCR. In principle, a wide range of energy
sources can be used as a primary fuel for reforming. The selection of
fuel type for the generation of H2 takes into account the availability
of the primary fuel and fuel supply infrastructure, the energy value
of the fuel, the thermal conditions of the reforming process, the
reformate composition, the cost of catalysts needed for reforming,
and long-term stability [61]. This choice is coupled with the selec-
tion of the heat recuperation process. Thus, the subsequent discus-
sion is divided into the following subsections:

P(cid:3) Recuperation by decomposition and SR (in the absence of oxy-
gen). This is probably the most promising approach and we pro-
vide a detailed description of the main reactions (Section 3.1.1),
operating temperatures and side reactions (Section 3.1.4).

P(cid:3) Partial recuperation by autothermal reforming, where part of
the feed undergoes catalytic combustion in presence of oxygen
(Section 3.1.2).

P(cid:3) Dry reforming where the exhaust gas is used to reform the feed
(Section 3.1.3). This process and to a lesser extent SR, exhibit
catalyst deactivation due to coking (Section 3.3).

P3.1.1. Main reactions in steam reforming (in the absence of oxygen)

PA schematic layout of steam fuel reforming application to an

internal combustion engine is displayed in Fig. 2.

PHerein, we describe the main factors that affect the choice of fuel,
while limiting ourselves to the main reactions [SR, water gas shift
(WGS), and decomposition reactions (Eq. 1)] that are inevitable in
most systems:

PThese are overall (unbalanced) reactions that do not describe the
atomistic mechanism and ignore the formation of many other possi-
ble products (several specific cases are outlined below). However,
for reformer design purposes, most studies present the kinetics in
terms of one (overall SR), two (SR, WGS), or the three reactions.
Product composition depends on the catalyst and reaction condi-
tions, however, with leading selective catalysts, the selectivity to
other products may be small or even negligible. Sufficiently high
temperatures, high steam/carbon ratios (S/C), and long residence
times lead to syngas (CO + H2) that partially undergoes a WGS reac-
tion (Eq. 1b) to form CO2. Whether one should aim for sole decompo-
sition (in the absence of steam (cid:1) Fig. 2) or the overall reaction
depends on various factors including the S/C ratio, available heat
transfer areas, coking, and reformate feed dependence of ICE behav-
ior.

PTo make the discussion more concrete, the following examples

are considered:

PMethane SR: Natural gas (mainly comprising methane) has cap-
tured the attention of researchers as a potential primary fuel for
onboard reforming [23,62(cid:1)64]. Compared to diesel fuel and gaso-
line, natural gas is a truly low carbon intensity fuel [65]. Moreover, it
is normally free from aromatic hydrocarbons, thereby contributing
towards lower particle emission [66].
In addition, natural gas
reserves are globally more evenly distributed, thus contributing
towards energy supply security and more stable market prices [23].
Methane SR is usually described by Eq. 2a, followed by the WGS
reaction (Eq. 1b).

ð2aÞ

CH4 þ 2H2O gð Þ $ CO2 þ 4H2DH0

298 1⁄4 165kJ=mol

ð2bÞ

PEq. 2b describes the overall system. The reforming temperature
of methane is relatively high (723(cid:1)1023 K) [63,67] and is mainly
determined by the equilibrium conditions required for high conver-
sions. Catalyst deactivation caused by the sulfur content in natural
gas can also be challenging in onboard fuel reforming [23], however
technologies for sulfur removal (desulfurization) are available.

PAlcohol reforming: The overall steam reforming processes of
methanol (MSR), ethanol (ESR) and glycerol (GSR; by-product of bio-
diesel production) are represented by Eqs. 3a(cid:1)5a. On the other
hand, the kinetic scheme of higher order (C (cid:2) 2) alcohol reforming
involves many possible side reactions, so that other compounds,
such as alkenes, aldehydes etc. are produced along with the compo-
nents of the reaction set. Many studies have reported that when SR
is conducted on various catalysts based on Ni, Ir, Co, Ru, Rh, Pt or
others, the most significant products are CH4, CO2, CO and H2. These
are created by the decomposition of methanol, ethanol, glycerol
(Eqs. 3b(cid:1)5b), and other oxygenates, which are endothermic with
negative DG values and can be considered irreversible at low pres-
sures. The decomposition is followed by an endothermic SR reaction,
an exothermic WGS reaction, dehydrogenation and methanation
[68(cid:1)78]. At the right conditions (temperatures > 573 K, moderate
pressures, but mainly high residence times), the conversion of
methanol, ethanol and glycerol is complete, as predicted thermody-
namically [79].

PMethanol decomposition can occur on Cu at temperatures as low
as 473 K. Since the subsequent WGS reaction is already active at
these temperatures, high MSR conversions can be achieved at low
temperatures. Moreover, large temperature gradients can be estab-
lished for heat transfer in the recuperation process. Ethanol decom-
position can proceed at low temperatures but produces methane (as
well as syngas). Thermodynamic analysis suggests that to achieve
reasonable conversions in the subsequent methane SR reaction
(Eq. 2a), temperatures > 873 K are required. The same applies to GSR
[80,81]. Evidently, the reformer limiting temperature is that of
decomposition and methane can be fed as part of the fuel. Moreover,
higher temperatures are required for more complex feeds.

PNowadays, ethanol reforming is still attracting much attention.
This process affords a high hydrogen production yield, and with a
proper selectivity - low rates of side reactions [82]. The thermody-
namics of ESR has been widely discussed in the literature [82(cid:1)85].
Methods and main findings of the reforming thermodynamic analy-
sis are discussed hereafter (sub-Section 3.2). Attempts to analyze
ESR in view of its use in ICE with TCR were made in [45,86]. It was
shown, using the equilibrium approach and considering SR, metha-
nation, ethylene formation and polymerization reactions, that the
optimal ESR energy efficiency (sub-Section 3.2) and the highest
hydrogen yield are achieved at T = 1073 K and a steam-to-ethanol (S/
E) ratio of 1.2 (at atmospheric pressure). CH4 and CO2 molar fractions
reach a minimum at T = 1073 K and S/E = 1.2 and increase with a fur-
ther rise in the S/E ratio. This S/E value is substantially lower than
the one recommended for fuel cell applications (S/E = 3. . .6) [85,87].
In these latter applications, CO formation must be eliminated via the
WGS reaction (Eq. 1b) to avoid the fuel cell electrodes from being
poisoned by CO [85]. Conversely, in ICE application, CO does not act
as a poison. Thus, compared to fuel cell applications, the S/E ratio
required for onboard ESR can be greatly reduced. This implies less
energy required for water heating and evaporation. Unfortunately,
analysis of the whole ICE-reformer system [86] revealed that high-
temperature ethanol steam reforming is not a practical option for
ICE with TCR and does not allow final efficiency improvement of the
whole engine-reformer system. This is due to the large energy
demand of the high-temperature SRE process, which cannot be satis-
fied without compromising the engine efficiency.

PHence, experimental attempts to reduce the reforming tempera-
ture have been made to maximally utilize the engine waste heat
[26,88(cid:1)90]. Hu et al [89] focused on reforming hydrous ethanol
(75% ethanol and 25% water) by applying a dielectric barrier dis-
charge plasma reactor filled with quartz beads. A 45% conversion
was reported. Shimada & Ishikawa [90] studied SR of hydrous etha-
nol with 40(cid:1)60 wt.% ethanol over Pt/Al2O3 catalyst at 573 K report-
ing relatively low conversion that decreased with a reduction in
ethanol concentration (hydrous ethanol). Li et al [26] argued that
rich feed is not viable and suggested as optimal S/E = 1 (i.e.75%
hydrous ethanol). They studied ESR over CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst,
using the exhaust gases to heat the reformer, and achieved up to
57% conversion at 673 K that dropped to 27% at 573 K. However, cat-
alyst deactivation due to pulverization and coking was also reported.
Morgenstern and Fornango [88] suggested another approach to low-
temperature ethanol decomposition (Eq. 4b) at 523(cid:1)573 K, thus
enabling utilization of exhaust waste heat. The method was exten-
sively tested by the authors [27,91,92]. They reported that compared
to E85 (reference fuel), 50% fuel reforming led to a substantial
increase in BTE (10(cid:1)17%) at medium and light loads. The pre-igni-
tion problems observed in ICE with TCR were resolved by limiting

Pthe hydrogen content in the induced fuel via partial fuel reforming at
light and medium loads and by using the liquid unreformed fuel
(E85) at high loads.

PEfficient high-pressure fuel reforming plays an important role in
realizing the significant advantages of ICE with direct fuel injection.
These include a higher maximal power per unit cylinder volume and
prevention of pre-ignition problems [13].

POctane/gasoline reforming: Due to the difficulty of replacing the
existing distribution infrastructure of gasoline, there is vast interest
in the reforming of octane. This usually requires high temperatures
and was investigated mainly in the context of H2 and synfuel pro-
duction for fuel cells (PEM and solid oxide fuel cell - SOFC, respec-
tively). Al-Musa et al. [93] studied isooctane SR on supported Cu
catalysts. In the absence of side reactions, the desired reactions
(Eq. 6) were predicted to yield H2 selectivities of 17/25 and 25/33 for
S/C ratios of 8 and 16, respectively.
C8H18 þ8H2O ! 8COþ17H2 DH0 1⁄4 1310kJ=mol
C8H18 þ16H2O ! 8CO2 þ25H2 DH0 1⁄4 1684kJ=mol

ð6Þ

PAl-Musa et al. [93] also revealed that high conversion can be
achieved at temperatures (cid:2) 973 K and S/C ratio of 24. H2 selectivity
of »55% with relatively high selectivity towards methane ( > 20%)
and several higher alkanes is obtained (Fig. 3). These values should
be compared to equilibrium calculations exhibiting > 70% selectivity
towards H2 with nil production of methane and other alkanes. The
interpretation by Kopasz et al. [94] suggests breakup of isooctane
into lighter hydrocarbons, followed by SR, WGS reaction, methana-
tion, and other reactions to produce the observed distribution. The
results in Fig. 3 afforded when using a ceria support, are significantly
better than those on other supports that exhibit smaller conversions
and smaller H2 selectivities and higher methane concentrations [93].
However, Cu/Ceria catalytic activity deteriorates with time due to
coking.

PWe have elaborated on isooctane SR to demonstrate that: (i) the
thermodynamic predictions may be limited, and (ii) SR of octane
requires high temperatures that may render recuperation impracti-
cal. Still, future discoveries of better catalysts may alter this conclu-
sion.

POther fuels: Other considered primary fuels for onboard reform-
ing include dimethyl ether (DME) [95], urea/ammonia [96(cid:1)98], glyc-
erol [81], and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) [99,100]. Cracknell et al.
[101] attempted to formulate synthetic fuels that are compatible
with both the reformer and the ICE.

PIn summary, the reaction temperature should be sufficiently low
to allow heating of the feed with the engine exhaust gas at a reason-
able heat transfer area. Typical exhaust gas temperatures for SI
engines range from 823 and 1073 K, depending on the operation

Pmode. Conversions at the given reformer temperature may be lim-
ited by kinetics or thermodynamics in a reversible reaction. In gen-
eral, alcohols and oxygenates are more reactive than hydrocarbons
[102]. Hence, these alcohols can be reformed at relatively low tem-
peratures by using relatively cheap catalysts. The low reforming
temperature for methanol (523 (cid:1) 573 K) [54,55] and ethanol (573 (cid:1)
873 K) [55,88,103] (depending on the desired reaction, decomposi-
tion or SR) along with sufficient heat transfer between the exhaust
gas and the reformer, afford a complete reforming by utilizing only
the exhaust gas heat. However, according to thermodynamics, con-
siderable amounts of methane may be produced in ESR. Complete
ESR to H2 and CO2 requires significantly high temperatures 873 (cid:1)
1073 K [104,105], which cannot be attained with the reformate as a
standalone fuel. High conversion in methane SR requires tempera-
tures > 1023 K. Gasoline and diesel fuel reforming usually requires
temperatures > 1073 K. This is considered impractical unless cou-
pled, to some degree, with fuel combustion (Section 3.1.2). Most of
these results are limited to atmospheric pressure. An increase in
pressure would lead to declining equilibrium conversions with
stronger effects at lower temperatures (Fig. 4).

P3.1.2. Auto-thermal reforming (in the presence of oxygen)

PTo overcome the endothermicity of SR and coke deposition, sev-
eral studies introduced a limited amount of oxygen (air) to achieve
partial oxidation (Eq. 7a and Fig. 5) or oxidative SR (Eq. 7b and
Fig. 6). The latter may allow achieving an energetically near-neutral
system.
Partial oxidation reforming : CnHm þO2 ! COx þH2 þH2O DHr < 0

ð7aÞ

Oxidative SR :

CnHm þO2 þH2O ! COx þH2 DHr » 0
ð7bÞ
PThe above equations are not balanced and exothermicity depends
on reaction selectivity to H2, which in turn depends on the operating
conditions. However, one cannot simply control the product distri-
bution. Hydrogen is usually more reactive to oxidation than alkanes
and alcohols and will probably be consumed if oxygen is available.
Higher amounts of oxygen in the reactor will allow greater internal
heat production through exothermic oxidation reactions, however
at the expense of a lower heating value of the resultant reformate.

PPartial oxidation reforming (Eq. 7a) may look simpler, because it
does not require water as a reactant (Fig. 5). However, its design
raises many issues. For example, should the partial oxidation be cat-
alytic? Otherwise the reformer temperature may exceed that of the
exhaust. The SR technique affords a larger H2 yield and a higher
reforming product heating value over partial oxidation reforming

P[106]. Oxidative SR (auto-thermal reforming - Eq. 7b), a hybrid pro-
cess that combines the first two strategies (Fig. 6), enables energeti-
cally balancing exothermic partial oxidation and endothermic SR by
proper selection of O2/CnHm and H2O/CnHm molar ratios [107]. Again,
its design raises several questions and optimization problems.

PAs argued earlier (sub-Section 3.1.1), the high temperatures
required for steam reforming of methane and higher hydrocarbon
fuels (gasoline and diesel fuel) make this approach unpractical for
most applications of ICE with TCR. In this case, partial oxidation
(Eq. 7a), where the energy required to sustain the endothermic reac-
tions is supplied through exothermic reactions of fuel oxidation, is
more suitable for onboard fuel reforming [108]. The catalysts used to
promote partial oxidation reactions should withstand high tempera-
tures [109]. Moreover, they should be resistant to the effects of
adsorption of sulfur species originating from the fuel [110] and to
the formation of inert carbon-rich species that could block the cata-
lytically active sites [108,111]. However, the use of fuels that
undergo hydrodesulfurization is anticipated in future applications.

PPartial oxidation can be used with gasoline as a fuel to offer cer-
tain advantages for engine startup. However, it requires a specific
reformer design, while recuperation of the exhaust energy is

Pdoubtful. This process can afford high CO and H2 selectivities but
only within a narrow parameter domain. Moreover, its product dis-
tribution (including some olefins) may lead to coke formation [112].

P3.1.3. Dry reforming and exhaust gas fuel reforming

PEndothermic dry reforming is another possible type of reforming
reaction, which is intensively considered by researchers, especially
for gasoline and diesel fuel reforming [113,114]. For methane:
CH4 þ CO2 ! 2CO þ 2H2 DHr > 0

ð8Þ
PIts main advantage is in using exhaust gas for fuel reforming
[47,60,108,115]. This method was developed in the past few decades
by researchers from the University of Birmingham [113,116]. It relies
on achieving energy recovery from hot and wet exhaust gases by
endothermic catalytic dry reforming and SR of hydrocarbon fuels
with a fraction of the engine exhaust gas (Fig. 7). The presence of
oxygen in the exhaust gas also results in exothermic reactions of
fuel oxidation. Thus, exhaust gas fuel reforming can be described by
the ideal reactions of partial oxidation reforming (Eq. 7a), SR
(Eq. 1a), dry reforming (Eq. 8), WGS (Eq. 1b), and complete fuel oxi-
dation. However, Tsolakis and Golunski [117] claimed that there is

PReactions such as methanation (Eq. 9b) and reverse methane SR
(Eq. 1a) are also possible. These reactions can be suppressed by
choosing the appropriate catalyst and S/C ratio.

PDeactivation by CO disproportionation (Boudouard reaction,
2CO!C + CO2) is considered less favorable for MSR since the higher
CO2/CO ratio minimizes the thermodynamic driving force. Changes
in oxidation state [Cu(0)/Cu(I)] may also result in decreased activity
and changes in selectivity. Twigg & Spencer [121] reported that cok-
ing and catalyst poisoning (chloride, sulfur) remain the main sources
of deactivation in methanol decomposition and methanol SR reac-
tions involving advanced promoted CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts.

PFor ESR, aside from the desired reactions (Eq. 4a), several other
reactions including ethanol decomposition (Eq. 4b), ethanol dehy-
drogenation to acetaldehyde (Eq. 10a) and its subsequent decompo-
sition (Eq. 10c) or SR (Eq. 10d), ethylene formation (Eq. 10b), and the
Boudouard reaction, may also occur [82,122].

3.2. Thermodynamic analysis of the reformer-ICE system

PThermodynamic analysis of fuel reforming is usually performed
to evaluate the influence of the reforming process parameters (reac-
tants ratio, temperature, pressure, etc.) on the reformate composi-
tion. Thermodynamic analysis of various reforming methods
(mainly for H2 production in fuel cell applications) is quite common
[82,123(cid:1)125]. However, most studies are limited to atmospheric
pressure and high S/C ratios. For the analysis, the reactions or the set
of species should be specified. The analysis is performed either using
equilibrium constants [123,126], or by minimization of Gibbs free
energy [82].

PAs previously discussed, the fuel reforming process is a complex
multiple reaction system. The total enthalpy of combustion of the
reforming products depends, in a complex manner, on the process
conditions. To analyze the efficiency of the fuel reforming process, it
is essential to know the integral effect of the process variables on
the total enthalpy of combustion of the reforming products and the
heat duty (enthalpy of reaction + enthalpy of vaporization + sensible
enthalpy). The latter is the invested resource [127]. Based on the 1st
law, this efficiency can be defined, as the ratio of the difference
between the enthalpy of combustion of the reforming products
Hcomb, and enthalpy of the primary reactants Hin, to the invested
resource - heat duty Hd (Eq. 11) [45]:
h 1⁄4 ðHcomb (cid:1)HinÞ=Hd

ð11Þ
PIn [128] a comparative analysis of energy efficiency of different
alcohol reforming processes was performed for various reforming
temperature and steam-to-fuel (when relevant) conditions. The
maximal energy efficiencies of the ESR, MSR and low-temperature
ethanol reforming (ethanol decomposition) processes were deter-
mined at 0.59 (T = 1073 K and steam-to-ethanol ratio = 1.2), 0.66 (T
(cid:4) 573 K and steam-to-methanol ratio = 1.2) and 0.42 (T = 570 K, no
water added), respectively. The above-discussed approach is some-
times adopted for tasks where an ICE with TCR is considered. In the
latter case the reformer and the engine are analyzed separately and
outputs of the reforming process investigation are used as inputs for
the engine performance analysis and vice versa [86,128].

PClearly, when fuel reforming is employed for waste heat recovery
and hydrogen production in ICE, the ICE and the reformer units are
coupled and thus, the system should be considered as a whole. This

Pno conclusive evidence of direct partial oxidation (Eq. 7a) in exhaust
gas reforming. High temperatures ((cid:2) 1073 K) are required to sustain
exhaust gas fuel reforming reactions [60,118].

PThe thermodynamic benefit of exhaust gas fuel reforming
depends on the dominance of the endothermic reactions of SR
(Eq. 1a) and dry reforming (Eq. 8) [115]. In these reactions, a hydro-
carbon fuel is converted to a mixture of H2 and CO (both ICE fuels)
by consuming exhaust gas energy. Thus, a gaseous reformate fuel
with higher enthalpy than that of the primary fuel is produced. Reac-
tants required to sustain the steam and dry reforming reactions are
water and carbon dioxide, both of which are present in engine
exhaust gas. As mentioned above, oxygen is also usually present in
exhaust gas (especially in diesel engines) and is consumed through
complete or partial fuel oxidation reactions. These exothermic oxi-
dation reactions reduce the process efficiency, but are required to
raise the reformer temperature. The main disadvantage of this
approach is coke formation [47]. Thus, the reforming conditions
must be carefully controlled to avoid intensive carbon formation
and deposition on the catalyst. The hydrogen-rich reformate is usu-
ally recirculated into the intake manifold so that the term “reformed
exhaust gas recirculation (REGR)” is frequently used [115]. Tsolakis
et al. [119] reported a 3% fuel consumption reduction with REGR
addition. They also determined that the bioethanol-fueled homoge-
neous charge compression ignition (HCCI) engine demonstrates
higher tolerance to REGR than EGR, thus enabling extension of the
HCCI operating mode and a reduction of pressure rise rates due to
the higher REGR levels. Lebouvier et al. [120] studied exhaust gas
fuel reforming of diesel fuel by a non-thermal arc discharge for NOx
trap regeneration. This and other applications of fuel reforming for
exhaust gas aftertreatment are discussed below in Section 6.

P3.1.4. Side reactions

PAs stated above, several undesired products may be formed dur-
ing the reforming process. Byproducts, such as dimethyl ether
(Eq. 9a), methyl formate (Eq. 9c), and formaldehyde (Eq. 9d) may be
formed during methanol decomposition and MSR. These in turn may
promote deactivation routes via pyrolysis.

Prequires an appropriate modeling approach. Relatively few efforts
have been made to perform thermodynamic analysis of a complete
system that includes an ICE and a reformer. Information on 2nd law
analysis of an ICE with TCR is especially limited. Chakravarthy et al.
[20] have performed a detailed 1st and 2nd law thermodynamic
analysis of thermochemical recuperation (TCR) applied to an ideal
internal combustion engine. They assumed the engine to be operat-
ing over an ideal cycle at constant pressure or constant volume gas-
eous fuel/ air mixing in the combustion chamber,
isentropic
compression of the air-fuel mixture, adiabatic constant-volume
combustion of the mixture at the point of maximum compression,
and isentropic expansion of the burned gases to atmospheric pres-
sure. The adiabatic reformer is assumed to reach the equilibrium of
the SR reaction (only CO + H2 products). At constant-pressure mix-
ing, primary fuel reforming, reformate cooling and mixing of the
cooled reformate with air are performed at constant ambient pres-
sure prior to entering the combustion chamber. For constant-volume
mixing, reforming and reformate cooling with subsequent refor-
mate-air mixing are assumed to take place at constant volume.
Hence, contrary to the constant-pressure case, the initial pressure in
the combustion chamber is higher than the ambient pressure. Nota-
bly, in their analysis, Chakravarthy et al. significantly simplified the
processes that occur in a real ICE with TCR. Moreover, the authors of
[20] considered various fuels and showed that due to an extension
of the lean combustion limit, ICE fed by hydrogen and CO yielded
more work per unit fuel exergy. They also determined that for a stoi-
chiometric methanol/air mixture, TCR can increase the estimated
ideal engine 2nd law efficiency by »3% (percent-points) or > 5% for
constant-pressure or constant-volume reforming, respectively. The
better efficiency of the latter process is attributed to the increase in
the net expansion work caused by a higher initial cylinder pressure.
For ethanol and isooctane, the estimated second law efficiency
increase for constant volume reforming is 9 and 11 percent-points,
respectively. These results reveal that the 2nd law efficiency
improvement observed for TCR is mainly due to the higher inherent
exergy of the reformate and the pressure boost associated with an
increase in the number of moles of the gaseous reforming products.
Evidently, the idealistic simplified approximation of the engine
working cycle does not take both the finite duration of fuel combus-
tion and the increase in pumping work due to throttling into consid-
eration. Thus, the important benefits of H2-rich reformate fuels
(high burning velocity and wide flammability limits), which enable
the system to approach the efficiency of an ideal Otto cycle and
unthrottled operation, cannot be assessed. Although this work sug-
gests that ethanol and isooctane SR are viable recuperation vectors
(Fig. 8), a single reaction under equilibrium is assumed and tempera-
tures are significantly larger than expected because of the assumed
adiabaticity.

PThe exhaust gas exergy upstream and downstream of a reformer
was analyzed to assess exhaust energy recovery in an SI ICE fed by
gasoline (primary fuel) with exhaust gas fuel reforming [129].
Exergy analysis allowed the investigation of the influence of the
reformed EGR (REGR) flow rate and the reformed fuel fraction on
exhaust gas energy recovery. An increasing energy recovery trend
(reduction of exhaust gas exergy) with increasing REGR rate and
reformed fuel fraction was revealed [129]. Applying 2nd law ICE-
TCR system analysis through the exergy destruction approach allows
a comparison between various fuel reforming methods and targeting
of the system components where most exergy (ability to produce
work) is lost. This approach was recently applied by Chuahy & Kok-
john [130] to a CI engine fed by diesel primary fuel and a dual-fuel
combustion strategy in which the reformate was employed as a sup-
plement to the primary fuel. A comparison of three different fuel
reforming methods (partial oxidation, auto-thermal reforming, and
SR) revealed that the highest exergy destruction was afforded for
partial oxidation (due to its exothermic nature, while SR provided

sis of a reformer-ICE system (note the required temperatures for high conversions),

Pthe highest 2nd law efficiency. Notably, the 2nd law analysis per-
formed in this work enabled identifying a substantial exergy
destruction source in the investigated TCR system layout (cid:1) refor-
mate cooling downstream of the reformer. This was responsible for
up to 13.6% system exergy destruction of the endothermic reforming
systems [130]. To mitigate this exergy loss, primary fuel pre-heating
by a hot reformate can be applied [131] (Figs. 2, 5-7).

PThe inclusion of reforming kinetics into the combined ICE-
reformer model is essential to predict reformer size, reforming
dynamics, and the mutual relationship of the ICE and reformer per-
formances. A joint engine/reformer operation must be considered to
accurately predict the exhaust manifold and reformer effluent condi-
tions. Such a combined model was developed for a DI SI engine with
TCR and methanol primary fuel using GT-SUITE software [132] and
is described in [133]. A common approach to reformer modeling as a
1-D non-isothermal homogeneous packed bed reactor (no inter-
phase gradients were assumed) with co- or counter-current heat
exchange was applied. This method allows more flexibility in the
choice of catalyst type. An empiric power-law rate equation was
used instead of full kinetic-derived schemes.

PThis model was further developed and applied to the thermody-
namic analysis of a direct injection (DI) SI ICE with high-pressure
TCR [13] and of a DI HCCI engine with reforming-controlled com-
pression ignition [134]. In the latter case, a single-zone HCCI com-
bustion process was assumed and the combustion rate was
predicted based on the chemical kinetics equations suggested by
Kaiser et al. [135] (standard ChemKin-II formatted mechanism file).
Thermodynamic properties of the species used in the chemical
kinetic model were acquired from the ChemKin-II thermodynamic
data. These methods of TCR are discussed later in this article (Sec-
tion 5).

PApplication of the joint ICE-reformer model with reforming
kinetics allows the prediction of the transient behavior of complex
ICE-TCR system and the peculiarities of heat transfer phenomena as
well as optimization of the reformer design and reformate supply
strategy. Moreover,
it numerically proves that the contribution
towards BTE improvement from lean engine operation (possible
because of the H2-rich reformate fuel) is greater than that from the
fuel LHV increase [133]. Results of thermodynamic analysis per-
formed using this model revealed that the reformate direct-injection
carried-out under
method is unviable when reforming is

Patmospheric pressure [13]. The significance of cooling the reforming
products prior to their injection into the engine-cylinder was dem-
onstrated.

PNumerical approaches to reformer or/and engine (fuel-air mixing
and combustion) modeling can be applied when detailed informa-
tion about species flow and concentration fields is required
[136(cid:1)138].

3.3. Carbon deposition and S/C effect

PCarbon deposition is probably the most important concern that
needs to be addressed in all catalytic techniques employed in hydro-
carbon and oxygenate fuel reforming, including oxidative reforming
[107,111]. Carbon can be formed mainly either through a strongly
endothermic hydrocarbon thermal decomposition reaction [139]:
CnHm ! nCsolid þ ðm=2ÞH2
ð12aÞ
or through associations and polymerization of olefins. This unde-
sired phenomenon is especially relevant when processing heavy
fuels, since thermal cracking reactions can easily occur at relatively
low temperatures and the formed byproducts (mainly olefins) can
induce the formation of carbonaceous deposits [140(cid:1)142]. More-
over, when alcohols are reformed (e.g. ethanol) in an insufficient
steam supply, they can dehydrate to ethylene according to Eq. 10b
with subsequent carbon formation through ethylene polymerization
[82]:
C2H4 ! polymers ! 2C þ 2H2

ð12bÞ
PCarbon can also be formed from decomposition or hydrogenoly-
sis (Eq. 9b or 4b and Eq. 13a for methanol and ethanol, respectively)
and the subsequent methane decomposition reactions (Eq. 13b), as
well as from the Boudouard reaction (Eq. 13c):
C2H5OH þ 2H2 ! 2CH4 þ H2O DHr < 0

ð13aÞ

CH4 ! C þ 2H2

ð13bÞ

2CO ! C þ CO2

ð13cÞ
PThe rate of coking crucially depends on the S/C ratio, since the
coke can react with surface oxygen produced from water dissocia-
tion. Most ICE-with-TCR studies (both experimental and numerical)
have naturally focused on methanol as a primary fuel due to its rela-
tively low reforming temperature [25,56,128,143] trying to find an
optimal steam-to-methanol (S/M) ratio. In their review, Iulianelli
et al. [38] reported that S/M < 1 can provoke coke formation and cat-
alyst deactivation. As a result, most research on MSR has focused on
S/M > 1. In their work [144], Choi and Stenger demonstrated that at
S/M > 0.76 (mole/mole), the MSR products are limited to CO, CO2,
H2O and H2 only. While the decomposition reaction is fast and

Palmost complete, the subsequent WGS reaction is limited by kinetics
(low temperatures) or equilibrium (high temperatures). The overall
reaction for methanol is:

where x is the CO selectivity [145]. Thus, CO selectivity is the only
factor affecting the heating value (HV) of the methanol reformate,
and HV increases linearly with x. Higher S/M ratios lead to a decline
in CO formation [146] and therefore, a reduction in reformate heat-
ing value. Moreover, the energy necessary for water evaporation
requires a larger heat transfer area between the exhaust gas and the
methanol-water mixture at the evaporator. A high S/M ratio usually
implies a more stable catalyst, however, this effect is not accounted
for in most models. Agarwal et al. [147] reported an increase in the
MSR reaction rate when the S/M ratio was increased to 1.4, thereby
allowing downsizing of the reformer. However, in many cases, the
rate is determined by heat transfer. Data reported by Santacesaria &
Carr(cid:2)a [148] only agree with the findings of Agarwal et al. at tempera-
tures (cid:3) 453 K. Results afforded by Lee et al. [149] also do not support
these findings. These data imply that for an ICE with TCR using
methanol as primary fuel, the S/M ratio should be in the range of 1
and 1.4 [133]. Thattarathody et al. [150] studied the kinetics and
deactivation of MSR over CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 at 0 < S/M < 1 and
P < 6 bar. They found deactivation rates to be marginal at 1 bar for S/
M > 0 but become appreciable at higher P and/or S/M = 0 (Fig. 9). It is
attributed to coke formation based on Temperature Programmed
Oxidation of spent catalyst. CO concentrations are negligible at S/
M = 1 and significant at S/M = 0 and/or high pressure.

PRostrup-Nielsen [152] studied the thermodynamic proclivity of
gaseous mixtures to coke formation with subsequent carbon deposi-
tion on the catalysts. Equilibrium with respect to SR (Eq. 1a) and
WGS (Eq. 1b) reactions was assumed in this work. However, other
factors also influence the likelihood of carbon (coke) formation. For
example, the nature of the solid catalyst is important both in terms
of the metal and support [102] (sub-Section 3.4).

PIn summary, carbon formation is strongly dependent on the type
of hydrocarbon to be reformed, catalyst type, reaction temperature,
and O/C and S/C molar ratios. Higher O/C and S/C ratios reduce coke
formation.

3.4. Reforming kinetics and catalyst selection

PCatalysts should be active, selective, stable over time, inexpen-
sive and safe. Activity and selectivity are determined by the active
metal choice and sometimes by interaction with the support. Cata-
lysts are usually build with a porous support to provide high surface

Parea, active metals that catalyze the reaction and promoters that are
usually added to enhance stability by suppressing coking (carbon
deposition) or inhibiting sintering (coalescence of catalyst crystalli-
tes), two of the main causes of deactivation. However, the support is
not inert and in many cases, it affects deactivation or even reaction
rates. Catalyst components are still chosen based on experience and
qualitative understanding.

PMost of the reported results were conducted with steam at atmo-
spheric pressure and isothermal conditions. Conditions in the actual
reformer can be different in an ICE with direct reformate injection,
since the reformer must operate at pressures as high as those in the
engine cylinder during the compression stroke. Furthermore,
decomposition reactions maybe superior to those observed in SR.
However, information about deactivation under such conditions is
scarce. Catalyst selection and the determination of reaction kinetics
still require a lengthy experimental study and cannot be presented
as a methodical procedure. Over the past two decades, emerging
studies have employed computational catalysis (DFT) for catalyst
selection (mainly of active metal) and derivation of kinetics, how-
ever, a description of this is beyond the scope of this review.

PMethanol SR: Two groups of catalysts are employed in methanol
SR: copper-based catalysts, which are inexpensive and active and
group VIII - X catalysts, which exhibit better thermal and long-term
stability. Copper-based catalysts are preferred for economic reasons
[54]. However, these catalysts display some disadvantages including
pyrophoricity and deactivation by thermal sintering, coke deposi-
tion, and changes in oxidation state [144,153,154]. Copper crystalli-
tes readily undergo sintering at temperatures > 573 K [121]. Indeed,
for conventional copper-based catalysts, an operating tempera-
ture (cid:3) 533 K is recommended. Copper sintering is also reported to be
a function of steam concentration.

PA detailed review of MSR studies published by Sa et al. [54]
lists the active catalysts, supports, promoters, mechanism, and
kinetics of
the process. When the SR temperature ranges
between 473 and 573 K, e.g. when methanol is employed as a
primary fuel, SR is favored over the commercially available cata-
lyst - alumina-supported Cu/ZnO [25,56,128]. The CuO/ZnO/
Al2O3-based catalysts have been extensively studied both at low-
temperature (453 (cid:1) 483 K) and higher temperature (473 (cid:1)
573 K) ranges [121,145,146,155(cid:1)163]. More importantly, copper-
based catalysts are not active in the methanation (reverse
reforming) reaction (Eq. 6b) and gas that is almost methane-free
can be produced at low temperatures and high pressures to fully
convert a primary fuel to CO2, CO and H2. CuO/ZnO formulations
usually comprise stabilizers and promoters, such as alumina,
alkaline earth oxides, and other oxides, to inhibit sintering and
absorption of catalyst poisons. Table 1 summarizes main recent
findings on the most popular copper-based catalysts. Notably,
most studies do not employ the S/C = 0 (i.e. decomposition) sce-
nario.

PSeveral studies have focused on the effect of catalyst structure
and catalyst synthesis procedures. Zirconia was shown to have a
promotional effect on Cu-Zn catalysts by decreasing CO selectivity
[167,168]. In addition, ZrO2 can increase Cu dispersion [167]. Al2O3
can increase both the total surface area and Cu dispersion [168],
while Cr2O3 was reported to stabilize Cu against sintering [169,170].
The promotional effects of CeO2 on Cu proved better than those of a
ZnO, Al2O3, or ZnO-Al2O3 system under the same reaction conditions
[171]. This was attributed to the high dispersion of Cu metal par-
ticles and strong Cu-CeO2 interactions. In the mixed oxide catalyst
CuZnGaOx [165], the interface between Cu metal-defective oxides
plays an important role in determining the activity. For the recently
developed PdZn/ZnO catalyst [172], a strong synergism between
active sites on the PdZn alloy and those on the ZnO support is neces-
sary for excellent catalytic activity. The activity and selectivity are
strongly influenced by the calcination atmosphere of the ZnO pre-
cursor with increased activity from oxidation to reduction. The
increase in the concentration of oxygen vacancies on the surface of
the ZnO support increases the activity by providing additional sites
for water adsorption. Thus, the replenishment of oxygen vacancies
on this support leads to the suppression of CO formation. However,
catalyst activity dropped by 24% after a 48-h stability test under
MSR conditions. The activity and selectivity of the Pd/ZrO2-m
(monoclinic) catalyst were further enhanced by the addition of cop-
per as a promoter particularly at low temperature ( < 493 K) [166].
The enhanced activity results from the strong interactions between
Pd and Cu as well as enhanced metal phase dispersion when mono-
clinic ZrO2 was used. Zn/TiO2 catalysts were also considered for
methanol reforming [173]. Pinzari et al. [173] reported that an ade-
quate amount of zinc (xZn > 0.02) in the catalyst is necessary to pre-
vent coke formation and reduce the formation of undesirable
byproducts. Pd-based catalysts are also receiving much attention
due to their high activity and selectivity [174,175].

PSeveral studies have correlated measured data to a reaction rate
expression, usually presented as a single reaction. Initial attempts
described the kinetics by power law rate expressions. Jiang et al.
[176] analyzed the reaction mechanism of MSR on Cu/ZnO/Al2O3.
They employed the Langmuir-Hinshelwood rate equation, assuming
that the r-WGS reaction is negligible. Peppley et al. [160,161] devel-
oped a comprehensive model for the kinetics of MSR on Cu/ZnO/
Al2O3 catalysts from the analysis of the surface mechanism; this
accounted for all three possible overall reactions. Certain questions
about process modeling, such as whether the process comprises
decomposition and WGS (Eqns. 3b, 1b) or overall SR and r-WGS (3a,
reverse 1b), remain open. At high contact times and temperatures,
the WGS (Eq. 1b) reaches equilibrium with the result being indepen-
dent of the route. Under other conditions, the predicted CO/CO2 ratio
is dependent on the assumed mechanism. Thattarathody et al. [150]
studied the kinetics and diffusion effects of MSR over CuO/ZnO/
Al2O3 at 0 < S/M < 1 and P < 6 bar in a packed-bed for application as

Pthe feeding reformate to ICE utilizing TCR. A simple kinetic model
assuming methanol decomposition followed by WGS was used to
describe the results and its parameters calibrated (Ea = 50 kJ/mole,
independent of S/M). At atmospheric pressure, conversions at S/
M = 0 were inhibited (Fig. 9), probably due to CO inhibition. The
apparent methanol decomposition rate constant (kMD) is almost dif-
fusion-free for a 0.7-mm particle size. Analysis and experiments sug-
gest that 1 - 2 mm pellets are optimal.

PEvidently, the kinetics can be significantly more complex than
the models described above. A parallel study [151] using an Auto-
Chem Micromeritics 2920 micro-reactor reported oscillatory behav-
ior evident by MS signals observed at 523 K (Fig. 9, right). A complex
model is necessary to account for this behavior, however, such a
model is not expected to change the recuperation properties of the
system significantly.

PEthanol SR: A comparative study of product distribution on vari-
ous catalysts at 973 K, atmospheric pressure and stoichiometric feed
was presented by Aupretre et al. [177]. This suggested the following
order in terms of hydrogen yield: Rh»Ni > Pd > Pt > Cu»Zn > Ru
(Table 2). Note that Rh and Ni also produce little ethylene (a coke
precursor) and methane.

PCatalysts based on Ni, Cu and Co active phases supported on zir-
conia, alumina, and magnesia are frequently used for ethanol steam
reforming [122]. There is rich evidence to suggest that Ni-based cat-
alysts are often prone to coke deposition [178,179]. Ni/La catalysts
have also displayed high activity in ethanol reformation and
improved stability at increased temperatures and high S/C ratios
[180]. Resini et al. [181] have studied Ni(cid:1)Zn(cid:1)Al- and Ni(cid:1)Mg(cid:1)Al-
based catalysts for ethanol steam reforming and only observed H2,
CO2, CO, and CH4 in the products at temperatures (cid:2) 750 K. Under
these conditions, the H2-yield is limited by the fast WGS reaction
that reaches equilibrium. At lower temperatures, the yield is also
limited by the ESR equilibrium [181]. Furtado et al. [182] reported
that applying 1% Cu and 10% Ni on ceria/zirconia resulted in a sub-
stantial improvement of catalyst activity. Goula et al. [183] studied
ESR over a Pd/g-Al2O3 catalyst to afford a hydrogen selectivity up to
95% at »923 K. They observed an increase in coke formation when
water-to-ethanol ratio in the feed stream decreased below the stoi-
chiometric value; this was well in agreement with works that inves-
tigated MSR. Promising results were achieved by Benito et al. [122].
They found that Co-based catalyst supported on zirconia displays
high resistance to coke formation and excellent stability. In addition,
complete ethanol conversion was achieved at temperatures (cid:2) 873 K.
Morgenstern and Fornango [88] developed a novel Raney-type Ni-
Cu catalyst (sponge-metal catalyst, porous structure with a large
surface area) from Raney nickel coated with a high loading of copper
(28%). In the absence of water, high ethanol decomposition activity
was achieved at temperatures typical for MSR (523 (cid:1) 573 K). Such
low reforming temperatures enable the use of ethanol reforming in
the energy required to sustain the
ICE with TCR, when all

Pendothermic reaction of ethanol decomposition can be recovered
from the engine exhaust gas [27].

PCatalysts comprising more than one active species have also been
investigated because of their significantly different catalytic proper-
ties with respect to either of the parent metals [184,185]. The syner-
getic effect of Pt addition to Ni-based catalysts improved the activity
of the non-noble metal towards hydrogenation reactions to afford
lower coke formation rates than those observed for monometallic
Ni-catalysts [184]. When Pt and Ni were supported on CeO2 by
depositing the non-noble metal on the support surface before the
noble metal, Pt became directly available at the gas-solid interface
and ethanol adsorption was favored. Thus, better agreement with
thermodynamic data from a regular fixed bed was observed
[74,103]. Zhong et al. [186] reported that Rh/ZrO2 and Rh-Fe, and
Rh-Co/Ca are good catalysts for ESR. They demonstrated that FexOy
incorporation reduces CO adsorption on Rh by CO spillover and sub-
sequent WGS on Fe [187].

PHydrocarbons SR: More expensive noble metal-based catalysts are
usually required for hydrocarbon fuels reforming due to poisoning
(by sulfur) and coking (Section 3.1.2). Amongst the catalysts aimed
at onboard hydrocarbon fuel reforming, Pt(cid:1)Rh-based catalysts sup-
ported on ceria-zirconia, K-promoted Co(cid:1)Rh catalysts, and Rh/Al2O3
catalysts are frequently considered [188(cid:1)190]. Peucheret et al. [190]
reported that a slightly less active but less sulfur-sensitive catalyst
can be designed by using a more sulfur-tolerant support material
and excluding Pt (oxidizes SO2 in the exhaust to SO3). They con-
cluded that the Pt(cid:1)Rh catalyst is most suited to exhaust-gas fuel
reforming in engines fed with a sulfur-free fuel, whereas the Rh-
only catalyst is the better choice when the fuel contains sulfur.
Nickel has also been considered as a catalyst for gasoline fuel
reforming (mainly for fuel cell applications) because of its high elec-
tronic conductivity, thermal stability, activity, and low cost [191].
However, it presented low conversion of gasoline-type fuels at low
temperatures typical for modern ICEs (especially for diesel engines)
and was easily deactivated at high temperatures [192(cid:1)194]. Addi-
tion of a second metal (Co, Mo, W, Re, or Pd) to the Ni-alumina cata-
lyst resulted in some activity improvement at lower operating
temperatures [195].

3.5. Reformate gas constituents

PH2, CO2, CO, CH4 and H2O are the main products of fuel reforming
(unreformed fuel usually presents in the reforming products as
well). In oxidation reforming, N2 and O2 can be found in the final
reformate. Knowing the physical properties of various reformate
components is essential to assess the physical properties of the
reformate mixture. Table 3 lists various properties of the main refor-
mate constituents as well those of the most common primary fuels
for comparison.

PThe parameters that influence the composition of the reforming
products include the primary fuel type, reforming method, steam-

P(Table 3) for unreformed methanol and ethanol, respectively. As
mentioned previously, higher burning velocity of the fuel in ICE, ena-
bles getting closer to the most efficient ideal Otto cycle with heat
supply at a constant volume.

PNote that reformate mixtures can be substantially different com-
pared to syngas and vary widely in composition. For example, MSR
products consist mainly of H2 (75% mol) and CO2 (25% mol), whereas
ethanol decomposition products comprise even molar fractions of
H2, CO and CH4. Available data on reformate combustion is fragmen-
tary and not well-systematized. Thus, information on reformates
burning velocity and its dependence on reformate composition and
combustion conditions is clearly essential.

PPoran et al. [133], and Tartakovsky et al. [28,128] simulated
reformer-ICE systems operating at different reformate compositions
applying the Wiebe model with correction for combustion velocity
and reported strong performance improvement with H2-rich ICE
feed.

PSome data is available on the laminar burning velocities of syn-
gas/air premixed flames with varying H2/CO ratios (5/95 - 75/25)
diluted with N2 or CO2 (dilution rate from 0% to 60%) at atmospheric
pressure and room temperature at various fuel/air ratios [213]. Nota-
bly, presence of a diluent gas, (nitrogen or carbon dioxide), in the
reformate leads to a reduction in flame temperature and conse-
quently a decrease in burning velocity. The latter is proportional to
the heat capacity of the diluent gas (multiple of its mass and specific
heat). The effect of pressure on the burning velocity of some syngas
compositions was also investigated in [214,215] for a limited

Pto-fuel ratio, reforming temperature and catalyst selectivity [54].
The highest hydrogen yield (up to 75 mol % H2) is achieved with
MSR (Eq. 3a) and ESR when other reactions are ignored. A very high
reformate hydrogen content results in higher values of burning
velocity and wider flammability limits (Table 3). Reduction in the
steam-to-fuel ratio contributes towards a decrease in the H2 fraction
and to the replacement of CO2 with CO. For example, the use of a
nickel-based catalyst can contribute towards the formation of CH4
for both methanol and ethanol reforming [54]. When methane is
formed during the reforming process, whether intentionally or as a
byproduct,
the reformate volumetric energy density increases
(Table 3), while the hydrogen content decreases, thus affecting the
burning velocity and flammability limits of the reformate.

3.6. Reformate combustion

PInformation on the fundamental combustion properties (mainly
combustion front velocity) of the reforming products is essential for
a comprehensive analysis of the ICE-TCR system, as well as for the
design of a dedicated combustion chamber. Data on the dependence
of the laminar burning velocity on pressure, temperature, mixture
composition, and stretch rate are essential for engine combustion
models.

PAn acceptable approximation for laminar burning velocity (SL)

was suggested by Frank Kamenetskii [209]:

Þ1=2

ÞD

SL 1⁄4 k Tmð
ð15Þ
ð
where k(Tm) is the first-order reaction rate constant estimated at the
maximal temperature (Tm), usually from the Arrhenius relation;
k = Aexp(-E/RT); and D is the diffusivity that exhibits D»1/P behavior.
PNumerous studies of the burning velocities of pure H2 and some
syngas (H2/CO) mixtures were reported [210(cid:1)212]. Verhelst and
Wallner [196] have compiled a detailed overview of hydrogen com-
bustion in internal combustion engines along with relevant informa-
tion on phenomena leading to hydrogen flame cellularity (flame
front instability), laminar and turbulent burning velocities at atmo-
spheric conditions (Fig. 10) and the effects of various factors on the
flame speed in engine-relevant conditions.

PIn summary, Verhelst & Wallner [196] have pointed out that
experimental data on the laminar burning velocity of H2(cid:1)air mix-
tures at engine-relevant conditions are still rare and consequently,
available numerical data are non-validated. A comparison of data on
laminar burning velocity of alcohol reformates (Fig. 11) with those
of unreformed methanol and ethanol (Table 3) clearly shows a great
advantage of burning H2-rich reformates. For example, burning
velocity of MSR products containing 75% mol. H2 and 25% mol. CO2
(x = 0 and z = 0 point on Fig. 11) at stoichiometric conditions (λ = 1.0)
is well above 1.30 m/sec as compared to 0.43 and 0.41 m/sec

Ppressure range (from 1 to10 bar). Shy et al. [214] correlated experi-
mental measurements of turbulent burning velocities (ST) of syngas
(H2/CO) spherical flames with constant turbulent Reynolds numbers
and suggested the power-law relation:

1⁄4 a Dab

ST =u0
ð16Þ
where Da = (LI/u')(SL/dF) is the turbulent Damk€ohler number, dF (cid:4)
a/SL is the laminar flame thickness, SL (cid:1) is the laminar burning veloc-
ity, u' (cid:1) is the r.m.s. turbulent fluctuation velocity, LI (cid:1) is the integral
length scale of turbulence and a (cid:1) is the thermal diffusivity of
unburned mixture. The values for coefficient a (0.52) and exponent b
(0.25) were suggested in [214] for a lean H2/CO flame with a Lewis
number Le (cid:4) 0.76. The expression Eq. 16 was experimentally vali-
dated by the authors at a pressure range of 1(cid:1)10 bar. Goswami et al.
[215] studied the influence of elevated pressure (in the same
range (cid:3) 10 bar) on the laminar burning velocity of one specific syn-
gas composition (85% vol H2, 15% vol CO).

PAn experimental study on the effect of reformate composition on
the laminar burning velocity at atmospheric conditions was per-
formed by Omari et al. [216] for a wide range of possible reformate
compositions that included various H2, CO, CO2, and CH4 contents
and for various fuel-air ratios (excess air factor λ ranging from 1.0 to
1.9). Fig. 11 [216] shows that regardless CH4 selectivity (z values),
the laminar burning velocity of the reformate decreases slightly
with rise of CO selectivity (x values). A stronger reduction in burning
velocity with x increase is observed for leaner fuel-air mixtures.

PA decrease in H2-content contributes towards the reduction in
laminar burning velocity. Replacement of CO2 with CO leads to a
reduction in the dilution of the fuel-air mixture with CO2 and hence,
to an increase in the laminar burning velocity. Both factors compete
to control the laminar burning velocity, however, due to the signifi-
cantly higher laminar burning velocity of hydrogen, the H2-content
is dominant. This results in a monotonic reduction in reformate lam-
inar burning velocity with increasing CO selectivity. This trend
becomes stronger for higher excess air factors because of weakening
of the CO2-dilution effect in the initially air-diluted mixture.

PAn increase in methane content in the reformate, i.e. the rise of
CH4 selectivity (z values in Fig. 11), leads to a strong reduction in
laminar burning velocity. Although the increase in CH4 selectivity at
constant CO selectivity is associated with a simultaneous rise in CH4
content and a reduction in H2 content, the latter is not the dominant
factor that leads to the reduction of the reformate laminar burning
velocity. An analysis of the increase in z along a H2 constant-fraction
line helps to confirm this statement (Fig. 11). A similar decrease in
laminar burning velocity is afforded in both cases (z increase at
x = constant and z increase at H2-content = constant). This proves
that the increase in reformate CH4 content is mainly responsible for
the reduction in reformate laminar burning velocity.

PNotably, the results discussed above are afforded at atmospheric
conditions. Among the few works attempting to address the influ-
ence of factors typical for reformate combustion in ICE, the recent
study of Nguyen & Verhelst [143] who developed laminar burning
velocity correlations over a wide range of ICE-relevant fuel-air
equivalence ratios (0.5 (cid:1) 1.5), temperatures (550 (cid:1) 800 K), pressures
(10 (cid:1) 85 bar) and EGR levels (0% (cid:1) 30% mass) are worth mentioning.
Varga et al. [217] suggested a joint hydrogen and syngas combustion
model based on available experimental data on hydrogen and syngas
combustion. This data claimed to cover a wide range of tempera-
tures, pressures, equivalence ratios, and C/H ratios. Moreover, new
recommended rate parameters together with their covariance
matrix and the temperature-dependent uncertainty ranges of the
optimized rate coefficients were provided. The optimized model was
compared to 19 recent hydrogen and syngas combustion mecha-
nisms and provides an acceptable reproduction of the experimental
data [217].

PSimulation of the flame structure and propagation of the pre-
mixed laminar flame fronts allows investigation of the knock ten-
dency in spark-ignition engines fed by reformate-enriched fuels.
Nguyen & Verhelst [29] applied this approach to methanol-refor-
mate addition over a wide range of dilution levels and unburned gas
temperatures and proved that reformate addition, when ICE oper-
ates in a dual-fuel mode, reduces the knock tendency. A detailed
analysis of knock phenomena in a spark-ignition engine, including
super-knock in highly-boosted ICE, with deep insights into the pro-
cesses occurring during knocking combustion can be found in the
recent review of Zhi et al. [218].

4. Design of fuel reformer

PCorrect design of a fuel reformer is critical for achieving maximal
primary fuel conversion, the desired composition of the reforming
products, efficient utilization of the exhaust gas energy, low back
pressure and negligible coke formation together with compact
design and acceptable cost. We review the advantages and short-
comings of popular catalytic reactors like the fixed beds, monoliths
and fiber packed beds.

PMany fuel reformer designs are based on fixed-bed reactors
[26,27,63] that are simple to build and operate. However, fixed-beds
are not vibration-resistant and undergo mechanical attrition with
time [35]. Another important drawback of the fixed-bed reactors is
the relatively large pressure drop. On the other hand, solid-gas heat-
and mass transfer, are good. Monolith reactors, which are widely
used in exhaust gas aftertreatment systems, are characterized by a
low pressure drop and structure robustness [219]. Thus, they have
attracted much interest for their potential for application to hydro-
gen generation [220(cid:1)223]. The monolith reactor can also be

Pconstructed as a reactor-heat exchanger with a large surface area.
One drawback is the laminar flow in the monolith channels, which
results in poor (inter-phase) solid-gas mass- and heat transfer. On
the other hand, the wall heat transfer and the radial conductivity are
better in the monolith compared to the fixed-bed reactor. Novel
types of heat-conducting substrates have been recently developed,
notably compressed Ni-Al foam, Fe-Cr-Alloy foil, and Cr-Al-O micro-
channel cermets [222]. These advancements contribute towards
intensifying heat transfer in monolith-type fuel reformers, thus
improving their attractiveness for application to ICEs with TCR.

PA substantial part of the energy necessary for the reforming pro-
cess is consumed in the vaporization step. This often goes unnoticed
but should be addressed in the system design [35]. In their work,
Pettersson & Westerholm [35] overviewed various fuel reformers for
fuel cell applications and addressed the main challenges in the
reformer design, some of which are relevant for ICE thermochemical
recuperation systems. The issue of reactant mixing (e.g., ethanol and
water) was stressed by Kumar et al. [224] and much later by Li et al.
[26] in their works on the development of a reformer for an ICE
fueled by hydrous ethanol. Kumar et al. [224] suggested injecting
methanol and water to the reformer via an ultrasonic nozzle, which
generated a fine spray of 20-mm droplets. Li et al. [26] designed a
special mixing chamber in the reformer to improve gaseous steam
and ethanol premixing and to ensure subsequent homogenous cata-
lytic reactions according to the expected water-to-ethanol ratio.
Dams et al. [225] have described a reactor made of aluminum with a
plate-and-fin heat exchanger design. After oxidation of the alumi-
num surface, the thin washcoat layer was applied directly on the
reactor material. This approach resulted in favorable heat transfer
characteristics, the most important feature in ICE-based TCR systems
which utilize the waste heat from the engine exhaust gas.

PSall et al. [27] developed and tested three different reformer
design versions for low-temperature ethanol reforming (ethanol
decomposition; Eq. 4b) intended for automotive applications. They
demonstrated that the best catalyst retention and heat-transfer
properties are afforded by embedding the catalyst into a fibrous
metal basis with a density gradient. The longitudinal shell-and-tube
finned tube reformer exhibited efficient heat transfer and acceptable
ethanol conversion but proved unsuitable for automotive applica-
tions because of its high thermal mass, catalyst settling, and an unac-
ceptable rise in backpressure. The authors suggested a novel
transverse shell-and-tube reformer design, where banks of parallel
vertical catalyst tubes are extended through a transverse stack of
exhaust-side heat-exchange plates. This reformer exhibited high
ethanol conversion [27]. Moreover, it featured a relatively low ther-
mal mass and demonstrated a low and stable fuel-side pressure
throughout a 500-h test.

5. Engines with thermochemical recuperation

PVarious types of engines with thermochemical recuperation were
built and theoretically studied throughout decades of research in
this field [26,56,59,80,226]. Most works on alcohol (mainly ethanol
and methanol) reforming consider the application of TCR to spark
ignition engines [13,25(cid:1)27,56,90]. Exhaust gas and in-cylinder fuel
reforming processes can be efficiently applied to both SI and CI
engines [60,108,115,119,227(cid:1)229]. Shudo et al. [230,231] suggested
and experimentally studied an HCCI engine where thermochemical
recuperation was applied to both waste heat utilization and control
of the combustion process. Their approach is based on reactivity-
controlled compression ignition [232,233], which requires in-cylin-
der burning of two different fuels. This method utilizes DME and
hydrogen-containing methanol decomposition products as high-
and low-reactivity fuels, respectively. The main advantages of this
concept include the need for only one fuel tank with liquid methanol
as a primary fuel and improved energy efficiency. The latter is

Pachieved by exhaust heat utilization to sustain the endothermic
reactions of methanol dehydration to DME (Eq. 9a) and decomposi-
tion to syngas (Eq. 3b) [231]:

2CH3OH ! CH3OCH3 þ H2O

ð9abÞ

CH3OH ! 2H2 þ CO

ð3bcÞ
PHowever, the method utilizing on-board production of DME and
syngas from primary methanol requires two separate reactors,
which complicates the fuel supply system. Furthermore, the applica-
tion of methanol thermal decomposition for syngas production
(Eq. 3b) exhibits an increased rate of coke formation [153] (section
3.7) that may result in catalyst deactivation, thereby slowing down
or even terminating the process.

PAnother method that employs reforming-controlled homoge-
neous charge compression ignition was suggested and theoretically
proven by Eyal & Tartakovsky [134]. The main difference from the
method reported by Shudo et al. is the application of only one
reformer to control the production of both DME and H2.

PThe common finding in all studies on SI and CI TCR ICEs is that the
achievable improvement in energy efficiency is generally propor-
tional to the hydrogen content of the reformate combusted in the
engine cylinders. Evidently, the CO(cid:1)(cid:1)CO2(cid:1)(cid:1)CH4 balance in the
reforming products affects both engine performance and emissions.
A high burning velocity and wide hydrogen flammability limits
afford the closer approach to the efficiency of the most efficient ideal
Otto cycle, and achieve a reduction in cycle-to-cycle variability
together with possibility of unthrottled engine operation. Lean burn-
ing, possible due to the wide flammability limits of hydrogen, also
allows reduction in heat transfer losses and mitigation of pollutant
formation. Maximal efficiency gains can be achieved when the ICE is
fed with a fuel reformate as a standalone fuel. Recent data of [234]
illustrate the experimentally measured benefits of combusting MSR
and ethanol low-temperature reforming (ethanol decomposition)
products in a direct injection single-cylinder SI engine. The high
burning velocity of MSR and ethanol decomposition reformates
resulted in significantly lower flame development angles (compared
to the gasoline baseline), which was reflected in the reduction in
cycle-to-cycle variability. The results of experiments demonstrated
that the high hydrogen content in the MSR reformate (75% mol. H2)
allows the engine to operate with acceptable cycle-to-cycle variabil-
ity [coefficient of variation (COV) < 5%] up to λ = 3.4. The engine was
able to run unthrottled at idle at λ = 7 as opposed to the lean flamma-
bility limit of unreformed methanol at λ = 1.81 [235]. Lean burning of
H2-rich fuels allows substantial reduction of NOx formation. When a
hydrogen-rich reformate is used as a standalone fuel for ICE, dra-
matic reduction in pollutant emissions together with substantial
improvement in energy efficiency is possible. For example, reduc-
tions in NOx, CO, HC, and CO2 emissions by 73(cid:1)94%, 90(cid:1)96%,
85(cid:1)97%, and 10(cid:1)25%, respectively, were measured in a DI single-
cylinder ICE fed by MSR products (Fig. 12) [131]. Notably, a relatively
significant CO2 content ( (cid:3) 25% mol.) in the MSR reformate works as

improved by 18(cid:1)39% over engine operation with gasoline (Fig. 12).
As previously mentioned, this improvement is a result of the joint
influence of the following factors:

Padvancement in adaptive control strategies. Further research is
required to resolve the startup and transient behavior challenges
and bring the ICE-with-TCR concept to a market-ready development
level.

P(cid:3) Higher burning velocity of the hydrogen-rich MSR reformate.
This affords the closer approach to the efficiency of the most
efficient ideal Otto cycle (heat supply at constant volume).

P(cid:3) Wider flammability limits of the hydrogen-rich MSR reformate.
This allows unthrottled ICE operation in the whole range of
studied engine loads. Thus, a more significant improvement in
efficiency was observed at lower engine loads.

P(cid:3) Fuel-air mixture dilution with excess air and carbon dioxide (an
inherent component of the MSR reformate). This resulted in
lower temperatures in the combustion chamber and as a result,
lower heat losses.

P(cid:3) Waste heat recovery, which resulted in a higher MSR reformate

heating value.

PNotably, the percentage efficiency improvement (18(cid:1)39%) over
ICE feeding with gasoline is higher than the reduction in CO2 emis-
sions (10(cid:1)25%) because of carbon redistribution from CO and HC
emissions to CO2. For ICE feeding with gasoline, the carbon supplied
with the fuel is emitted as CO2, CO, and unburned hydrocarbons
(HC). On the other hand, for ICE feeding with MSR products as a
standalone fuel, emissions of CO and HC are mitigated by 90(cid:1)96%
and 85(cid:1)97%, respectively (Fig. 12). Hence, almost all the carbon
introduced by the fuel into the ICE is emitted as CO2, thereby result-
ing in lower reduction in CO2 emissions relative to efficiency
improvement. The results reported in these two works [131,234]
give an indication of the good potential of high-pressure TCR appli-
cation in achieving a substantial reduction in pollutant emissions
without aftertreatment. However, because the experiments reported
in these studies were conducted at constant speed, it is too early to
indicate whether exhaust gas aftertreatment would be necessary at
an automotive scale. Should exhaust gas aftertreatment be required,
a catalytic converter should be placed upstream of the reformer. In
such a configuration, cold start performance of the aftertreatment
system would not be affected and no significant influence on the
TCR performance is predicted.

PCold start and transient behavior of engines with TCR were iden-
tified as a major drawback of this concept [56,59]. Combustion of a
primary fuel has been considered as a tool for enabling ICE-with-
TCR cold starting and quick regime changing, thus leading to dual-
fuel engine operation with subsequent limitations of burning pri-
mary fuels [56]. Some new approaches to address the startup and
transient operation challenges have been recently suggested. Shudo
et al. [231] proposed the use of two accumulation vessels that allow
HCCI operation in a wide range of engine loads and speeds. Conse-
quently, the system weight and volume are increased, which may be
critical in some applications. Tartakovsky et al. [45,128] suggested
integrating an engine with TCR into a series-type hybrid propulsion
system, thus ensuring ICE operation at a constant regime favorable
for TCR, with the possibility of a reformer startup through electric
heating. The main disadvantage of this approach is the need for a
more complex design with all inherent disadvantages of a series
hybrid propulsion. Notably, an ICE with TCR integrated into a series
hybrid propulsion has not been reported to date.

PIn summary, nowadays, research and engineering aimed at
developing an ICE with TCR is attracting much attention. Promising
improvements in efficiency and emission mitigation have been dem-
onstrated. However, market implementation of this technology is
still remote. Reformer design should aim towards the development
of compact, reliable, and durable systems. Applying the TCR concept
further
to modern high-performance

engines will

6. Fuel reforming for emission aftertreatment systems

PThe positive effect of hydrogen on engine performance and emis-
sions has been well documented [196,236] and is discussed briefly
in this article. Moreover, when applied directly, hydrogen addition
positively affects the performance of various aftertreatment devices,
including catalytic converters, diesel particle filters (DPF), and NOx
traps [237,238]. The addition of hydrogen into the exhaust gas,
upstream of the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) catalyst in the
presence of unburned or injected HCs is known to improve low-tem-
perature NOx conversion by preventing catalyst poison accumula-
tion [239(cid:1)241]. There is also general agreement over the positive
effect of hydrogen on activating various hydrocarbons and on the
overall rate of HC-SCR NOx reduction [241(cid:1)243]. In their study, Sit-
shebo et al. [241] revealed that during HC-selective catalytic reduc-
tion of NOx over silver(cid:1)alumina, the known promoting effect of H2
is sensitive to the engine exhaust gas temperature, H2 concentration,
HC concentration, HC/NOx ratio, and space velocity.

PHemmings & Megaritis [238] studied the effect of a H2/CO mix-
ture at varying ratios on the diesel particle filter regeneration pro-
cess, whereas syngas was produced onboard through diesel fuel
exhaust gas reforming. They revealed that the most effective DPF
regeneration is achieved when syngas comprising 60% H2 and 40%
CO is supplied to the filter inlet. The addition of a H2/CO mixture
resulted in the complete afterburning of methane, ethylene, propyl-
ene, and acetylene. At the same time, an increase in NOx concentra-
tions was observed after the filter. Gill et al. [244] investigated the
influence of the reformed EGR on soot loading in DPF and catalyzed
DPF. They demonstrated that the reforming products introduced
along the EGR into the engine intake manifold contributed towards
the improvement of both engine combustion and aftertreatment
system performance. A significant decrease in total engine-out NOx
emissions together with an increase in both NO2 concentration and
NO2/NOx ratio was also observed. This resulted in improved filter
efficiency and overall soot loading reduction attributed to enhanced
soot oxidation through the NO2-oxidation mechanism. Soot loading
reduction leads to a lower pressure drop on DPF, which is an impor-
tant filter performance parameter affecting its durability and engine
efficiency. Evidently, the application of fuel reforming to improve
the performance of emission aftertreatment systems leads to a more
complex emission control system, increase in weight and volume
(due to addition of a catalytic reformer), and hence, a rise in the cost
of production.

fuel

PMost frequently, the reformate intended to improve the perfor-
mance of exhaust aftertreatment devices is produced onboard by
using catalytic exhaust gas
reforming (Section 3.1.3)
[237,238,241,244]. However, other approaches based on the applica-
tion of non-thermal plasma for fuel reforming, aimed at supplying
hydrogen to exhaust aftertreatment systems, have also been devel-
oped [120,245,246]. Plasma-based reformers can be combined with
catalysts, as was suggested by MIT researchers [245,246]. This allows
reduction in the required amount of catalytic materials. When noble
metals are applied as catalysts, cost savings could be significant. An
important advantage of plasma-reforming as compared to its cata-
lytic counterparts, is its rapid startup and transient response [245].
The main challenges are electrode erosion and high electrical power
consumption. For example, according to results reported by Lebouv-
ier et al. [120], when considering real NOx trap regeneration behav-
ior, the power necessary to run the plasma during the regeneration
phase (»12 sec every 11 km), is estimated at 2.2% of the engine

with performance improvements are required.

7. In-cylinder reforming

PIn-cylinder fuel reforming is another method of onboard hydro-
gen production in internal combustion engines [227(cid:1)229]. The main
benefit of this approach is the possibility of using the available
engine hardware and elimination of the need for a fuel reformer.

PIn-cylinder reforming is usually based on one of two basic
approaches: (i) burning a rich fuel-air mixture in the engine cylinder
to produce partial fuel oxidation products (mainly H2 and CO) and
their subsequent addition to a fresh charge and further combustion
[227]; (ii) use of a catalytic coating accompanied by water injection
to promote in-cylinder fuel SR [228]. Nickel-based catalysts, such as
Ni/MgAl2O4 and Ni/ZrO2 have been considered as coatings for the
combustion chamber surfaces [228]. Results from the theoretical
analysis performed by Sher & Sher [228], suggest the possibility of
improving the thermodynamic efficiency of the ideal ICE (compres-
sion ratio 25:1) with the in-cylinder fuel SR by nine percent-points
(from 66 to 75%).

PTo achieve partial fuel oxidation, some researchers suggest the
use of a dedicated cylinder in which rich-burn combustion occurs.
Researchers of the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) [227] sug-
gested a dedicated exhaust gas recirculation (D-EGR) concept based
on this principle, where one cylinder out of four was a dedicated
EGR cylinder, providing a constant 25% EGR to the engine (cid:1) Fig. 13.

PHydrogen presence in EGR contributes towards a higher burning
rate and as a result, better EGR tolerance of the engine. Notably, the
engine operation stability can decline when a dedicated cylinder is
used for reformate production [247]. This is a result of the indicated
mean effective pressure (IMEP) discrepancy between the cylinder
with fuel reforming and the rest of the engine cylinders. Such a dis-
crepancy can be reduced when a fuel with higher burning velocity
and wider flammability limits is applied [247]. The D-EGR concept
was proven to work efficiently with different primary fuels such as
gasoline, methane, ethanol, and methanol
[248(cid:1)252]. SwRI
researchers converted a 2012 Buick Regal GS car engine to D-EGR
operation [248]. They demonstrated an improvement in brake

Pthermal efficiency of at least 10% across the engine performance
map. This was attributed to improvement in EGR tolerance and com-
bustion quality. Avoiding the need of a reformer allowed the mainte-
nance of a good ICE transient response. Application of the D-EGR
concept allows improvement of the ICE antiknock performance.
According to recently reported results [249], an increase in ICE knock
resistance is linearly proportional to the fuel reformation ratio and
the slope of this improvement is not fuel-dependent. According to
this work, a 10% increase in overfueling in the dedicated cylinder
(amount of a primary fuel devoted to reforming) equaled a 1.8-point
increase in the fuel antiknock index.

PPartial fuel reforming can be also achieved through fuel injection
during the period of negative valve overlap (NVO) at O2-deficient
conditions and results in reforming products containing significant
levels of H2 and CO [253]. Notably, a dedicated cylinder is not
required for hydrogen production. NVO-reforming is a kinetically
controlled process. Concentrations of the in-cylinder reforming
products strongly depend on the fuel injection timing and injected
fuel type, however, they exhibit weak changes with NVO duration
and initial temperature variations [253]. Thus, NVO-reforming can
also serve as a tool for controlled variation of the fuel-air mix-
ture reactivity in low-temperature combustion processes. More-
over,
the NVO-generated reformate can improve the main-
combustion-period reactivity through both chemical and thermal
effects, although significant heat losses during the NVO-period
reduce the total-cycle thermal efficiency of the engine [254].
Thermal barrier coatings can be applied to reduce these losses
[255]. Acetylene was found to exhibit the largest impact on
increasing the fuel-air mixture reactivity for various tested fuels
due to its strong relative impact on reactivity and high concen-
tration in the reforming products [254].

PAnother approach of in-cylinder fuel reforming based on partial
fuel oxidation was suggested by researchers from the University of
Duisburg-Essen and investigated in cooperation with Karlsruhe
Institute of Technology [256(cid:1)259]. They applied an ICE as a polygen-
eration source producing syngas (a base chemical), heat and
mechanical work in a single device. Polygeneration is not intended
for automotive use, but can be beneficial in a variety of industrial
applications, for example in the chemical industry [256].

reactor-involved fuel

PIn summary, the biggest advantages of the in-cylinder reforming
approach are the avoidance of a catalytic reformer and the inher-
ently good transient and startup behavior. This facilitates its imple-
mentation into engine production technologies. Despite a lower
potential of in-cylinder reforming in onboard hydrogen production
significant
over
improvement in fuel economy and emission reduction can be
achieved. For example, recent data from D-EGR concept testing in a
2012 Buick Regal over FTP-75 and HWFET driving cycles displayed a
fuel economy improvement of 13% and 9% for city and highway driv-
ing, respectively, accompanied by a significant reduction in NOx
emissions (85% in FTP cycle) [250].

8. Decisions to be made when considering fuel reforming for ICE

PAs evident from the abovementioned information, the choice of
the primary fuel and reforming method is not straightforward and
depends on several factors. The main reforming approaches are:

P(cid:3) Decomposition: This approach can be conducted with alcohols
at low temperatures but not with low alkanes and requires high
temperatures for high alkanes. It is likely to lead to deactivation
due to coking (decomposition-to-carbon technology suffers
from very fast catalyst deactivation [260]). It does not require
energy investment for water evaporation or onboard water stor-
the resulting reformate displays a higher
age, moreover,
enthalpy of combustion compared to SR.

P(cid:3) Steam Reforming: This approach can be applied to methanol
(and maybe ethanol) at relatively low temperatures but requires
high temperatures for octanes. It is less susceptible to coking
but requires energy for water evaporation as well as water stor-
age.

P(cid:3) Partial oxidation (or autothermal reforming): This approach is
achieved by introducing air to the feed to reach the desired feed
enthalpy. This avoids coking but reduces the degree of recupera-
tion.

P(cid:3) Exhaust gas reforming: This approach requires high catalyst bed
temperatures ( > 1000 K) to allow heat recovery and is also lim-
ited by coke formation. However, compared to autothermal
reforming, it increases the potential for recuperation due to the
presence of both steam and dry reforming reactions. It also ena-
bles convenient reforming of conventional motor fuels. Gaso-
line-fed SI engines are well-suited for exhaust gas reforming
because of the high temperature and low oxygen content of the
exhaust gas.

PThe range of ICE operating modes in which the system is only fed
by the reformate is a very important issue that influences the trade-
off between system complexity and efficiency gain. Evidently, at
lower loads, a high H2-content fuel would be beneficial because of
the wide flammability limits and high burning velocity of H2. This
makes unthrottled engine operation with a lean fuel-air mixture
possible. At high-load regimes it is debatable whether H2-rich refor-
mates should be used alone or in combination with a primary fuel to
increase the volumetric energy density of the fuel. The latter method
could allow downsizing of the reformer-ICE system, improving its
transient behavior and providing high peak power. On the other
hand, engine feeding with just the reformate at higher loads has the
benefit of waste heat recovery through the reforming process. Signif-
icant CO2 concentrations in the reformate at high-load operating
modes would allow efficient mitigation of NOx formation, thus pre-
venting or at least relieving a need for EGR and other NOx emission
reduction strategies. The low volumetric energy density of the refor-
mate could be addressed by enhancing methane formation in the
reforming process [216].

PThe selection of an appropriate fuel reforming approach for an

ICE requires a number of considerations:

P(cid:3) Whether a catalytic reformer can be applied.
P(cid:3) Type of ICE considered for fuel reforming application.
P(cid:3) Type of primary fuel.
P(cid:3) Whether the reformate will be employed as a standalone fuel or
as an additive to be burned together with a primary non-
reformed fuel.

P(cid:3) The main purpose of fuel reforming: improvement of ICE effi-
ciency versus improvement of exhaust aftertreatment system
performance.

POther factors must also be considered. For example, when con-
sidering an alcohol as a possible primary fuel, one is faced with
issues of fueling infrastructure, suitability of onboard fuel storage
system, etc. Depending on the engine load control strategy, the
reformate can be used as a standalone fuel for power output produc-
tion or as a supplement fuel in a dual-fuel ICE intended for engine
performance improvement or/and power production in part of the
engine operating range.

PBased on the reforming fundamentals (Section 3) and engineer-
ing aspects of fuel reforming application in ICEs (Sections 4-7) dis-
cussed earlier, in this section we summarize and analyze factors
which mutual relationship should be taken into account when con-
sidering fuel reforming for ICE.

8.1. Considering whether a catalytic reformer can be applied

PA variety of reasons may inhibit the use of a catalytic reformer. In
such cases, various types of in-cylinder reforming processes should
be considered. Clearly, the complete elimination of a reformer to
produce a powertrain system of lower weight and size is desirable.

PThe incorporation of a catalytic reformer imposes additional chal-
lenges in terms of powertrain startup and transient behavior. This
may limit the range of possible applications and will require appro-
priate engineering solutions. These include engine startup with a
non-reformed primary fuel (with consequent efficiency and espe-
cially emission penalties), onboard reformate storage (weight and
size penalty), and integration of an ICE with TCR into a series hybrid
propulsion system (complexity penalty) [45,59]. Notably, for in-cyl-
inder reforming, the startup and transient behavior problems inher-
ent for reformer-containing applications are eliminated. On the
other hand, application of in-cylinder reforming does not allow the
maximal possible onboard hydrogen production potential to be
reached. This is because only a part of the primary fuel is replaced by
the hydrogen-containing reformate and subsequently combusted in
the ICE. The application of an in-cylinder catalytic coating [228]
raises concerns on catalyst stability that should also be taken into
account.

8.2. Primary fuel selection

PThe type of primary fuel determines the possible fuel reforming
approaches (Table 4). The distribution of conventional fuels (gaso-
line and diesel fuel) is simple and relies on the current fueling infra-
structure. However, such infrastructure is incompatible with ICE-
reformer systems that employ fuels like ethanol and methanol. The
chemistry of a fuel (or fuel mixture) in an ICE combustion chamber
affects the 1st and 2nd law thermodynamic efficiencies of the ICE
through a number of factors. These include the influence of the
molar expansion ratio (MER) (cid:1) a molar ratio of combustion reaction
products versus reactants, reaction product dissociation, and specific
heat ratio (k) [261]. Szybist et al. [261] demonstrated that 1st law
efficiency is mainly affected by MER and the k values of the reac-
tants, whereas 2nd law efficiency is greatly affected by product dis-
sociation.

PWhen adding a reformer to the powertrain system is a viable
option, the type of combustion process in the ICE, for which fuel
reforming is considered, naturally affects the spectrum of available
primary fuels to be considered. However, theoretically, the type of
combustion process does not preclude the use of a high-reactivity
primary fuel (e.g. diesel and jet fuel) in a spark-ignition engine with
fuel reforming. In the latter case, adding a hydrogen-containing
reformate to the combustion reaction can improve antiknock stabil-
ity, as is well documented in literature [262].

PWhen conventional fossil oil-derived fuels are the only options
that can be considered, the use of fuel reforming is normally
restricted to produce hydrogen as an additive to a primary non-
reformed fuel (dual-fuel operation) or a tool for improving the per-
formance of exhaust aftertreatment systems (Section 6). This is
mainly attributed to the high temperature required to sustain the
endothermic reactions of steam- and dry reforming of gasoline and
diesel fuel ( > 873 K; Table 4). Thus,
in this case, auto-thermal
reforming (Section 3.1.2) or exhaust gas fuel reforming (Sec-
tion 3.1.3) should be employed. Notably, higher amounts of oxygen
in the reactor will allow greater internal heat production through
exothermic oxidation reactions, however, this occurs at the expense
of a lower heating value of the resulting reformate.

PUsing low-carbon-intensity alternative fuels, like methanol and
ethanol, offers much higher flexibility in fuel reforming. The sub-
stantially lower reforming temperature (523(cid:1)573 K; Table 4) ena-
bles full substitution of a primary fuel by a hydrogen-rich reformate

Por the use of reformate gas as a hydrogen additive source. Engine
feeding with a reformate as a standalone fuel allows maximal bene-
fits in terms of efficiency improvement and emission reduction. On
the other hand, the dual-fuel approach enables downsizing of the
system. The choice of partial versus full substitution of the primary
fuel by a reformate will subsequently influence the selection of the
reforming method, preferred strategy of reformate supply to the
engine cylinders, and the possibility of unthrottled engine operation
(affects possible efficiency and emission gains). For example, Nguyen
& Verhelst [143] have performed a comparative analysis of MSR and
exhaust gas reforming methods in the dual-fuel operation of an SI
engine with methanol as a primary fuel. They concluded that for the
considered conditions, exhaust gas fuel reforming could be benefi-
cial. Clearly, if reforming is considered as a tool to improve the per-
formance of an exhaust aftertreatment
fuel
reforming will be sufficient with the consequent flexibility in choos-
ing a primary fuel and a reformate supply strategy.

8.3. Strategies of reformate supply to ICE

PIn earlier versions of ICEs with TCR the reformate was usually
supplied to the engine via fumigation into the intake manifold of the
engine [56]. Nowadays, diverse strategies of reformate supply to ICE
are available. The selection of a specific strategy depends on the
reforming application and load control method.

PThe following methods of reformate supply to ICE are considered

[59,202,266]:

P(cid:3) Fumigation into the intake manifold
P(cid:3) Low-pressure injection into the intake manifold or exhaust gas
upstream of the catalytic converter/particle filter (depending on
reforming application)

P(cid:3) Direct injection into the engine cylinders

PReformate fumigation into the intake manifold is still very popu-
lar and is the simplest method of reformate supply. However, this
strategy poses several limitations such as backfire and pre-ignition
phenomena, and maximal power loss due to the high volume of
hydrogen-rich gaseous reformates [59]. Due to the relatively low
volumetric energy density, a higher volume of reformate is required
for the engine to afford the same power. When the reformate is sup-
plied through the intake manifold, the gaseous fuel replaces the air.
Thus, at maximal loads, supplying the required amount of energy
with a gaseous reformate will result in subsequent reduction of air
mass being ingested by the cylinder, and maximal power reduction.
The same results are achieved when a lower amount of gaseous
reformate is supplied to ensure its complete combustion. In addition,
when the fumigation strategy is applied, the reformate flow rate
depends on both the reformate pressure and the instantaneous pres-
sure in the intake manifold. Thus, a decline in fuel flow control accu-
racy is observed. To mitigate some of these disadvantages, pressure
stabilizing valves and flame arresters are frequently installed in the
reformate line and intake manifold (between the intake valve and
the reformate supply point), respectively [26,266].

PIn some works, electronically controlled low-pressure injectors
have been applied to ensure accurate control of the flow rate at
which the reformate is supplied to the engine [23,266]. However,
this strategy does not resolve the problems of power loss, backfire,
and pre-ignition.

PSome studies have attempted to resolve the pre-ignition problem
by limiting the hydrogen content in the induced fuel [92]. This was
achieved by partial fuel reforming at light and medium loads and
the use of an unreformed primary fuel at high loads. Notably, if the
pre-ignition problems of ICE operating with a stoichiometric air-
reformate mixture and fuel supply to the intake manifold or port
fuel injection would be resolved, its maximal power output would
still be substantially lower than that observed for a gasoline-fed

Pengine of the same-size. This is a result of the high partial volume of
hydrogen in the intake mixture (hydrogen substitutes air in the fresh
charge) and absence of charge cooling that takes place during liquid
fuel evaporation in the intake manifold.

PUsing direct injection (DI) as the reformate supply method can
solve the above-mentioned problems. Previous studies on CNG- and
hydrogen-fueled engines confirmed that DI of a gaseous fuel is the
most promising method to achieve high efficiency and a power den-
sity comparable to that of gasoline engines, while resolving the pre-
ignition and backfire problems [267,268]. For direct injection of gas-
eous fuel, a relatively high injection pressure is required for two
main reasons: firstly, to enable fuel injection late in the compression
stroke thereby allowing mixture stratification. Secondly, to limit the
increase in compression work caused by the higher partial volume
of gaseous fuel compared to its liquid-fuel counterpart. Retarded
injection of the gaseous fuel may relieve this negative influence,
however, it presumes high injection pressure to overcome the pres-
sure build-up in the engine cylinder. Increased fuel penetration into
the densely-charged cylinder and choked flow through the injector
(simplifies the fuel flow-rate control) are additional advantages of
high-pressure injection of a gaseous fuel [13]. These benefits suggest
its suitability for application to an ICE with TCR [128]. Reformate DI
eliminates some of the major TCR disadvantages (pre-ignition, back-
fire, and maximal power loss) without limiting the hydrogen content
of the reformate or injecting a liquid non-reformed primary fuel at
high engine loads. Of course, the main benefit of DI, namely preven-
tion of engine power loss, is only relevant when the reformate is
applied as a standalone fuel for power output production. Contrary
to engines fed by a gaseous fuel from the compressed-gas vessels
(CNG), in fuel reforming, the energy necessary to compress onboard-
generated fuel prior to direct injection must also be taken into
account. Poran & Tartakovsky [13] reported that DI-ICE with thermo-
chemical recuperation is unviable if reforming is carried out at atmo-
spheric pressure. Researchers from the Technion suggested a
concept of high-pressure thermochemical recuperation based on
compression of the liquid primary fuel-water mixture prior to its
evaporation. This would significantly reduce energy investment in
reformate compression and thus, makes direct reformate injection
feasible (Fig. 14) [13,269].

PWhile reformate DI is the only known method that allows the use
of reformate as a standalone fuel, it requires a more complex TCR
system with a catalytic reformer and heat exchanger/s operating at
relatively high pressures (25 (cid:1) 60 bar). Availability of reformate
direct injectors with a large reference flow area is essential for DI ICE
with high-pressure TCR (Fig. 15) [13,131].

PThere are also several other noteworthy issues that might exhibit
a substantial influence on the system performance, including cata-
lyst deactivation at high pressures, the influence of reformate com-
position on fuel-air mixing inside the engine cylinder and
subsequent combustion, and the wall-adjacent reformate flames
that affect particles formation.

PWhen different fuel reforming methods are possible and a pre-
ferred method needs to be selected together with the desirable
reforming conditions, additional aspects, including catalyst stability
and performance and amount of water introduced into the reform-
ing process, should also be considered.

PIn summary:

P(cid:3) When the goal is ICE feeding with a reformate as a standalone
fuel, primary fuels with low reforming temperature (e.g. metha-
nol) should be selected. To prevent maximal power loss and
abnormal combustion and to maximize efficiency and emission
reduction advantages, a concept of high-pressure thermochemi-
cal recuperation with direct reformate injection to engine cylin-
ders would be beneficial.

P(cid:3) When the main goal is to improve the exhaust aftertreatment
performance, any primary fuel can be applied. When using con-
ventional primary fuels (diesel fuel and gasoline), the preferred
methods of fuel reforming are exhaust gas fuel reforming and
plasma-assisted reforming.

P(cid:3) When dual-fuel operation (reformate serves as an additive in the
combustion of a primary fuel) is sufficient, any primary fuel can
be applied in principle. The choice of fossil fuel (gasoline, diesel
fuel and natural gas) would require exhaust gas- or plasma-
assisted fuel reforming as the preferred methods. Special atten-
tion should be paid to the issues of coke formation and/or cata-
lyst sintering. The choice of an alcohol primary fuel, such as
methanol and ethanol, would allow SR application. In the latter
case, coke formation can be mitigated by employing an appro-
priate S/C ratio (Table 4).

P(cid:3) When a dual-fuel operation concept is applied, both direct and
external (to intake manifold) methods of reformate supply to
ICE are possible. Power loss and preignition will
limit the
amounts of reformate that can be supplied into the intake mani-
fold.

9. Open questions and future research trends

PWhile many diverse research activities have been performed in
the field of onboard fuel reforming, many issues still need to be
addressed to make it a viable technology. In this section we attempt
to list some of these open questions:

P(cid:3) The issues of fuel selection and appropriate reforming technolo-
gies are summarized in Table 4 and discussed in Section 8. Given
the efficient infrastructure for fuel distribution, the possibility of
using gasoline for heat thermochemical recuperation should
either be addressed or ruled out. Simple SR seems to be inappro-
priate due to the high reforming temperature required. Auto-
thermal reforming requires modeling to determine the degree
of partial oxidation required and the structure of the reformate.
This should be followed by experimental verification. The use of
exhaust gas reforming requires a catalyst that can withstand the
expected coking.

P(cid:3) Amongst all the fuels reviewed herein, the main focus has been
on methanol, which is already supplied in fuel stations in several
countries (e.g. China). Because ethanol reforming requires
higher temperatures, it has received less attention. However,
ethanol has the potential of higher heat recuperation. In both
cases, the effect of high pressures ( (cid:3) 60 bar) and sub-stoichio-
metric S/C feeds should be studied.

P(cid:3) As emphasized herein, one of the reforming advantages is asso-
ciated with the high combustion velocities of H2. The burning
velocities of various reformate compositions in conditions close
to those taking place in an ICE combustion chamber should be
investigated to allow further optimization of the reformate com-
bustion process in ICE. Reformate composition can be controlled
onboard, thus data on burning velocities are essential for perfor-
mance optimization of engines with TCR. While the combustion
velocities can be estimated from their kinetic parameters
(Eq. 15), the prediction of their behavior in a mixture is more
complex.

P(cid:3) Even though some information on penetration, mixing, and tur-
bulent combustion of hydrogen and methane directly injected
into the ICE cylinder is available, a dedicated study is required to
understand the in-cylinder behavior of multicomponent refor-
mate jets of various compositions. Unlike pure hydrogen and
methane, reformate mixtures comprise constituents with very
different properties (e.g. H2 and CO2) that can significantly alter

Ptheir behavior inside a cylinder, as compared to pure hydrogen.
This knowledge is necessary for performance improvement and
emissions reduction in engines fed by syngas or an onboard gen-
erated reformate.

P(cid:3) Further knowledge on reformates/syngas penetration, mixing,
and turbulent combustion will serve as a basis for further devel-
opments in reformate direct injectors. Similar to hydrogen direct
injectors [196], in reformate injectors the issue of flow rate
increase is crucial.

P(cid:3) Compared to DI engines fed by H2, CNG, or syngas from pressur-
ized vessels, in DI ICEs with high-pressure TCR the issue of injec-
tion pressure should be investigated and optimized in joint
consideration of engine performance and high-pressure reform-
ing parameters.

P(cid:3) Research aimed at improving the startup and transient behavior
of ICE with TCR is required to widen the range of possible appli-
cations. Possible solutions include (i) the use of super-capacitors
and (ii) the use of partial oxidation to heat the reformer.

P(cid:3) Investigation of heat transfer processes in ICE with TCR is
required to elucidate the optimal configuration for this complex
system involving, contrary to conventional ICE, multiple pro-
cesses of fuel heating, evaporation and reforming while utilizing
the heat of the exhaust gas, and cooling of the reforming prod-
ucts before they are supplied to the engine. Further knowledge
on heat transfer in ICEs with TCR is crucial for the development
of compact and light automotive-scale TCR systems.

P(cid:3) Information on emissions of gaseous pollutants from engines fed
by reformates of various compositions,
including dual-fuel
engine configurations, is relatively well documented. There is
general agreement on the effects of the main constituents of the
reformate on CO, HC, and NOx formation. Conversely, available
data on ultrafine and nanoparticle size distributions and emis-
sions from an ICE fed by reformates is fragmentary and limited.
Information on the composition and morphology of particles
formed in an ICE with TCR is scarce. The low quenching distance
of hydrogen, which is the main constituent of the reformate
mixtures, raises questions about the possible contribution of
engine lubricants to particle formation in an ICE fed by a refor-
mate or syngas.

10. Summary and conclusions

PProperties of hydrogen, such as wide flammability limits, low
ignition energy, and very low energy density, make onboard storage
and supply of hydrogen to ICE cylinders challenging. Thus, onboard
production of hydrogen-rich fuels is attracting increasing interest.
The possibility of syngas production from diverse sources with its
subsequent use as a hydrogen-rich fuel in ICE further contributes
towards the intensification of research in this field.

PIn principle, a wide range of energy sources can be used as pri-
mary fuels for reforming purposes. For many years, gasoline and die-
sel fuel have been considered as the primary fuels for onboard
reforming because their usage does not require any changes in pro-
duction, distribution, and fueling infrastructure. However, gasoline
and diesel fuel reforming usually require temperatures > 1073 K.
Compared to these fossil fuels, lower alcohols, such as methanol and
ethanol, exhibit some important advantages that make them suit-
able as primary fuels for ICE with TCR. These alcohols can be
reformed at relatively low temperatures (523(cid:1)573 K) using rela-
tively cheap catalysts. Moreover, because they can be produced from
both fossil and renewable feedstocks, these two alcohols are also
favorable from a fuel production and availability viewpoint. Natural
gas has also captured attention as a potential primary fuel. Com-
pared to diesel fuel and gasoline, natural gas is a truly low carbon
intensity fuel. The reforming temperature of methane is relatively

Phigh 723(cid:1)1023 K, therefore, similar to gasoline and diesel fuel, addi-
tional heat should be supplied to sustain endothermic reactions of
methane reforming.

PMany techniques have been considered for onboard fuel reform-
ing in ICEs with TCR. Method selection depends on several factors
including the primary fuel used, available heat sources, and propul-
sion type: (i) the simple SR approach requires relatively low reform-
ing temperatures and was studied mainly for application to
methanol and ethanol. Methanol decomposition is an advantageous
process but is susceptible to catalyst deactivation. MSR may be
described by the main reactions of decomposition, WGS, and possi-
bly direct SR. When ethanol is considered as a primary fuel, the
method of low-temperature ethanol reforming (based on the reac-
tion of ethanol decomposition) can be a viable option. (ii) Partial oxi-
dation (auto-thermal reforming) can be used when the required
reforming temperature is too high, however the process is more
complex. (iii) Exhaust gas fuel reforming is usually applied when
gasoline and diesel are the primary fuels and applies pre-combus-
tion (with oxygen available in exhaust gas) to alleviate the high
reforming temperature required. It is considered to improve both
engine and aftertreatment device performances. This process can be
described by reactions of partial and complete oxidation, SR, dry
reforming, WGS, methanation and others, and usually yields a mix-
ture of products.

PInformation on the fundamental combustion properties of
reforming products with respect to the change in the heating value
of the air-fuel mixture is necessary for comprehensive analysis of
the reformer-ICE system as well as for a dedicated combustion
chamber design. Some progress has been made in recent years in
studying the laminar burning velocity of various reformate composi-
tions. However, data on the combustion properties of reformates at
engine-relevant conditions are still lacking.

PWhen fuel reforming is considered in an ICE with TCR, the two
units are coupled. Models simulating joint operation of
the
reformer-ICE system have been recently developed and used in a
few specific reforming applications. While the reformer model is rel-
atively simple, various complexities can be incorporated into the ICE
model and the prediction of the effect of hydrogen enrichment is
challenging.

PSome progress has been recently made in the design of reformers
for ICEs with thermochemical recuperation. However, all these activ-
ities remain at laboratory scale. Further study, probably with more
attention to monolith substrates, is required to develop reformers
suitable for automotive-scale demonstrations.

PSeveral engines utilizing various TCR concepts have been built.
The experimental results prove that when a hydrogen-rich refor-
mate is used as a standalone fuel for ICE, significant reduction in pol-
lutant emissions together with substantial improvement in energy
efficiency can be achieved. Further research is required to better
understand the role of CO2 in the combustion process of an ICE with
TCR. The achievable emission reductions and efficiency improve-
ments are generally proportional to the reformate hydrogen content.
Evidently, the CO(cid:1)(cid:1)CO2(cid:1)(cid:1)CH4 balance in the reforming products
affects both engine performance and emissions.

PNew approaches have been suggested to overcome the cold start
and transient behavior limitations of ICEs with TCR. Integrating the
engine with TCR into a series hybrid propulsion system ensures ICE
operation at a constant regime favorable for TCR, with the possibility
of a reformer startup through electric heating. Further research is
required to better understand the processes occurring in the ICE-
TCR system during a transient event.

PIn-cylinder reforming avoids the need for a catalytic reformer
and enables inherently good transient and startup behavior. This
facilitates its implementation into engine production technologies.
Despite the lower potential of in-cylinder reforming in onboard
hydrogen production compared to reactor-involved fuel reforming

Papproaches, significant improvement in fuel economy and emissions
reduction can be achieved.

PIt is well documented that the reformate supply to the intake
manifold exhibits several limitations such as backfire, pre-ignition
phenomena, and maximal power loss. In addition, accuracy of fuel
flow control deteriorates when a fumigation strategy is employed.
Applying the concept of direct reformate injection eliminates back-
fire, pre-ignition, and power loss but requires high-pressure reform-
ing. A study on the reforming process at high-pressures together
with advancements in the development of a reformate direct injec-
tor with acceptable flow rate capability are required to achieve fur-
ther progress in the development of this approach.

PThere are still numerous subjects that require further investiga-

tion.
