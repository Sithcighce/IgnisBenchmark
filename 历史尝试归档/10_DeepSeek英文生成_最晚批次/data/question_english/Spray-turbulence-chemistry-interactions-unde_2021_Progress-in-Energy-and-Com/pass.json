    "question_text": "How does turbulence-chemistry interaction (TCI) affect ignition delay time in low-temperature combustion (LTC) strategies, and what are the underlying physical mechanisms?",
    "standard_answer": "Turbulence-chemistry interaction significantly prolongs ignition delay time in LTC strategies through multiple mechanisms. At low initial temperatures (e.g., 850 K), turbulent fluctuations enhance the dissipation of heat and radical species during the first-stage ignition process, retarding the transition to high-temperature combustion. The transport probability density function (PDF) model shows that unresolved turbulent fluctuations broaden the thermochemical state distribution, increasing mixing timescales and delaying autoignition. Compared to well-stirred reactor models, TCI consideration reveals a 0.95 ms longer ignition delay at 850 K versus only 0.27 ms at 1000 K, demonstrating stronger TCI effects at lower temperatures. This occurs because turbulence enhances molecular interdiffusion through eddy breakup, steepening concentration gradients while simultaneously dissipating critical intermediate species like H2O2 and CH2O that drive low-temperature chemistry pathways.",

    "question_text": "How does the inclusion of turbulence-chemistry interaction in combustion models affect soot formation predictions in diesel spray flames?",
    "standard_answer": "The inclusion of turbulence-chemistry interaction (TCI) in combustion models significantly alters soot formation predictions through multiple mechanisms. Transport PDF models considering TCI effects typically predict lower soot mass compared to well-stirred reactor models, primarily due to enhanced soot oxidation rates and narrower soot distributions. TCI consideration moves soot onset and peak locations further downstream, as turbulent micromixing broadens the thermochemical state distribution and promotes more uniform mixture preparation. The wider range of local equivalence ratios and temperatures achieved with TCI models reduces regions favorable for soot nucleation and growth. However, contradictory findings exist where PDF models sometimes predict higher soot formation, attributed to the broader coverage of rich mixture conditions that are conducive to soot precursor formation. This discrepancy highlights the complex interplay between turbulent mixing timescales, chemical kinetics of soot formation pathways, and local scalar dissipation rates that collectively determine net soot production in spray flames.",

    "question_text": "How does combustion-induced dilatation affect flow reversal and fresh air entrainment in spray flames, and what are the implications for flame stabilization?",
    "standard_answer": "Combustion-induced dilatation significantly alters the flow field in spray flames through gas expansion effects. The chemical heat release increases gas temperature and causes volumetric expansion, which modifies velocity components at downstream positions. This dilatation magnifies existing vortices and can reverse flow direction back toward the nozzle. The velocity component toward the nozzle accelerates the transport of hot combustion products upstream, which influences spray evaporation and mixture preparation. Concurrently, this flow reversal counteracts fresh air entrainment into the spray flame. Compared to non-reacting cases, the entrainment of fresh air is reduced by approximately 25% for reacting cases, with the first drop in entrainment rate appearing at the location of the flame lift-off length. This reduction in entrainment affects mixture preparation and flame stabilization by limiting the availability of fresh oxidizer while enhancing the recirculation of hot products that can promote ignition and sustain combustion in the stabilization region.",

    "standard_answer": "The turbulent Weber number provides a quantitative framework for characterizing droplet deformation in spray atomization by relating turbulent kinetic energy to surface tension forces. Kourmatzis and Masri defined the turbulent Weber number as We' = ρg(u')²d/σ, where ρg is gas density, u' is RMS velocity fluctuation, d is droplet diameter, and σ is surface tension coefficient. This dimensionless parameter captures the competition between turbulent disruptive forces and cohesive surface tension effects. Experimental studies revealed a linear relationship between droplet aspect ratio and turbulent Weber number, where higher We' values correspond to more deformed, non-spherical droplets. Additionally, turbulent fluctuations were found to delay the evolution from deformed to more spherical droplet shapes by continuously introducing velocity gradients across droplet surfaces. The turbulent Weber number thus serves as a key predictive parameter for droplet morphology evolution in turbulent spray environments.",

    "standard_answer": "Turbulence affects premixed flames of hydrogen and dodecane differently due to their distinct global Lewis numbers. For lean hydrogen flames with a global Lewis number around 0.35, turbulence interacts with the premixed flame structure by creating regions of high positive curvature that enhance the burning process. This occurs because hydrogen's low Lewis number indicates higher fuel diffusivity relative to thermal diffusivity, allowing preferential diffusion effects to intensify burning in curved flame regions. In contrast, for premixed dodecane flames, the thickening effect of turbulence becomes more pronounced at high Karlovitz numbers. The paper specifically notes that while basic oxidation pathways remain largely unaffected by turbulent mixing, significant differences in species distribution in temperature space are observed between laminar and turbulent flames for these fuels. These differences stem from how turbulence alters convective transport and mixing characteristics based on the fuel's Lewis number properties.",
