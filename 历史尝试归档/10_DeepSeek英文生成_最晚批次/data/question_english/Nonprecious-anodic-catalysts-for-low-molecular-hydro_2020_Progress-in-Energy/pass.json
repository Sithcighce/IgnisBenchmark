    "question_text": "How do non-oxide metal catalysts like carbides and phosphides improve the electrochemical oxidation activity of Ni for hydrocarbons, and what electronic structure modifications contribute to their Pt-like behavior?",
    "standard_answer": "Non-oxide metal catalysts such as carbides (e.g., WC) and phosphides (e.g., NiP) enhance Ni's oxidation activity through electronic structure modifications that impart Pt-like behavior. When carbon or phosphorus atoms incorporate into interstitial metal sites, the metal lattice expands, increasing metal-metal distances. This causes a contraction of the metal d-band, leading to a higher density of states (DOS) near the Fermi level, similar to noble metals. For carbides, this band contraction reduces the density of unoccupied d-orbitals, enhancing catalytic properties. In phosphides, phosphorus's surplus valence electrons modify Ni's electronic structure, improving electrical conductivity and corrosion resistance. These changes facilitate easier electron transfer, reduce activation barriers for fuel oxidation, and mitigate poisoning by intermediates like CO. For example, Ni NPs supported on WC show synergetic electron transfer that promotes C-N bond scission in urea oxidation, while metal phosphides provide high ECSA and stability. The tunable interaction between non-oxygen elements and metals in these compounds results in superior physicochemical properties, including higher activity, selectivity, and anti-poisoning capability compared to oxide counterparts.",

    "question_text": "Explain the mechanism of urea oxidation over Ni catalysts in alkaline media, focusing on why CO₂ removal is the rate-determining step and how it leads to catalyst degradation through nickel carbonate formation.",
    "standard_answer": "Urea oxidation on Ni catalysts in alkaline media proceeds through both indirect and direct mechanisms, with NiOOH as the active site. In the indirect pathway, Ni(OH)₂ is electrooxidized to NiOOH (Ni(OH)₂ + OH⁻ ↔ NiOOH + H₂O + e⁻), which then chemically oxidizes urea to N₂, CO₂, and H₂O. In the direct mechanism, urea adsorbs on NiOOH, forming intermediates that decompose via sequential dehydrogenation and C-N bond cleavage steps. Density functional theory studies reveal that in all reaction paths, the last reaction (CO₂ removal) is the rate-determining step, as clearly supported from the highest free energy and the lowest reaction rate constant as confirmed by other researchers. Moreover, CO₂ is found to be the main reason for the degradation of urea oxidation compared to CO because it reacts with the Ni catalyst to form inactive nickel carbonate. This step involves desorption of CO₂ from the catalyst surface, which is thermodynamically unfavorable and kinetically slow, limiting overall oxidation efficiency and causing catalyst degradation through carbonate formation.",

    "question_text": "How does alloying Ni with Co enhance the electrochemical oxidation activity of Ni-based catalysts for methanol, ethanol, and urea in alkaline media, and what are the underlying mechanisms?",
    "standard_answer": "Alloying Ni with Co enhances oxidation activity through multiple synergistic mechanisms. First, Co facilitates the formation of CoOOH at lower potentials compared to NiOOH, reducing the onset potential for fuel oxidation. This is due to Co's ability to adsorb fuel molecules via interaction of free electron pairs from the fuel's O-atom with Co's partially vacant d-orbitals, improving reactant accessibility. Second, Co acts as a CO tolerance material by providing OH groups that oxidize adsorbed CO intermediates to CO2, mitigating catalyst poisoning. The improved performance with Co alloying is ascribed to the role of Co as a CO tolerance material by providing OH groups and/or a ligand effect, and the ability of Co to adsorb fuel molecules on its surface by the interaction of free electron pairs of the O-atom of the fuel to the partially vacant d-orbital of Co and its role as a CO anti-poisoning agent. However, excessive Co content decreases current density due to reduced Ni active sites, indicating an optimal Co ratio is critical for maximum performance enhancement.",
    "original_text": {
      "1": "Co is a well-known transition metal that significantly increased the oxidation activity of Ni toward methanol, ethanol, and urea. Regardless of the fuel used, an increase in the Co content in the NiCo alloys resulted in a general decrease in the onset potential due to the formation of CoOOH at lower potential than that of Ni.",
      "2": "The improved performance with Co alloying is ascribed to the following reasons: i) the role of Co as a CO tolerance material by providing OH groups and/or a ligand effect; ii) the ability of Co to adsorb fuel (ethanol) molecules on its surface by the interaction of free electron pairs of the O-atom of the fuel (ethanol) to the partially vacant d-orbital of Co and its role as a CO anti-poisoning agent."
