In this work, advanced technologies concerning warm gas carbon capture and hydrogen production from
carbon-based fuels are reviewed, with a primary focus on the elevated-temperature pressure swing ad-
sorption process coupled with the water gas shift reaction and in-situ CO 2 adsorption. Key progress in
the development of adsorption kinetic models, study of adsorption mechanisms, synthesis of efficient CO 2
adsorbents, design and process optimization of adsorption/desorption reactors, and integration of purifi-
cation systems, as well as major challenges and perspectives for the fundamental study and pilot-scale
system development are discussed. This review provides a theoretical basis for the scaling-up of the next
carbon capture system, and has scientific value and strategic significance for alleviating carbon emission
pressure, developing hydrogen fuel cell energy system, and reducing energy consumption of hydrogen
production in coal processing industries.

1. Introduction

Over the past one and a half centuries, the combustion of fossil
fuels such as petroleum, coal and natural gas has increased the at-
mospheric CO
2 concentration from 280 to more than 400 ppm [1] .
As a result, the global mean surface temperature has risen + 1 °C
since  the  pre-industrial  era  [2] .  If  the  trend  continues  without
artificial control, the global temperature might increase 2.5–7.8 °C
by the end of this century [3] . Considering more than 80% of the
current energy demand comes from fossil fuel-based power plants,
carbon capture and storage (CCS) is expected to become the pre-
dominant strategy against global warming [4] . On the other hand,
hydrogen, which can serve as the energy source for gas turbines
and fuel  cells,  or  as the  raw material for  chemical industries, is
facing  increased  demands  [5] .  Considering  that  natural  gas,  coal
and biogas provide more than half of the power sources in China,
one  technically  feasible  and  economically  attractive  solution  is
hydrogen production from carbon-based fuels with in-situ carbon
capture.  Although  there  are  several  technologies  for  hydrogen
production  from  renewable  energy  sources,  fossil  gaseous  fuel
reformation and coal gasification are still the most cost-effective
and practical methods at present [6] .

One of the key challenges for hydrogen production is the design
of an efficient purification process. In conventional hydrogen pro-
duction plants, the shifted gas should first be pre-cooled to meet
2  absorption  units,  and  then
the  temperature  requirement  of  CO
be reheated after the CO
2 removal ( Fig. 1 ). Additional purification
units are needed to remove the residual trace CO because of the
thermodynamically limited conversion rate in the water gas shift
(WGS) reactor [7] , which may otherwise degrade the electrochem-
ical performance of catalysts in the subsequent synthesis or power
units. Alternatively, the elevated-temperature pressure swing ad-
sorption  (ET-PSA)  process  based  on  WGS  catalysts  and  elevated-
2 adsorbents is able to achieve triple functions: CO
temperature CO
2 adsorption, and CO purification in
catalytic conversion, in-situ CO
a  single  unit  [8] .  ET-PSA  is  much  more  energy-saving  compared
with conventional purification units such as Selexol TM , Rectisol ®,
and MDEA: It works at elevated temperatures, which are between
200 and 450 °C, to avoid pre-cooling and re-heating the syngas; It
adopts the pressure swing to regenerate the saturated adsorbents,
thus avoiding energy consumption for heat regeneration [9] . In ad-
dition, ET-PSA overcomes the trade-off between the H
2 purity (HP)
2 recovery ratio (HRR) in conventional PSAs, where the
and the H
high HP is the key to ensuring the long-term operation of H
2 con-
2 produc-
sumers and the high HRR greatly improves the overall H
tion efficiency.

There are several controversial problems and bottlenecks con-
cerning the scaling-up of ET-PSA. On the adsorbent scale, effort s on
the elevated-temperature CO
2 adsorbents have been undertaken to
understand the adsorption mechanism and kinetics in real working
conditions (elevated temperature, high pressure, and in the pres-
ence of H
2 O), whereas the realization of the practical applications
and commercialization still require some breakthroughs on highly-
efficient, low-cost, and highly-stable adsorption materials. On the
column scale, specific reactors and separation processes should be

designed  to  achieve  both  efficient  CO
2
leakage. On a system scale, novel ET-PSA strategies are necessary
to break the trade-off between HP and HRR. Methods for quanti-
tatively comparing the energy consumption between parallel pu-
rification systems are needed. There have been published reviews
on warm gas carbon capture at the adsorbent scale [10–14] and
the system scale [15,16] . However, comprehensive reviews that dis-
cuss the key and controversial issues hindering the development of
ET-PSA, rather than summarizing all the scientific problems with
only general discussions for each topic, are still lacking. In addi-
tion, technical progress in recent years, such as in-situ characteri-
zation, novel adsorption testing methods, and new PSA strategies,
enable us to gain a deeper understanding of ET-PSA. Thus, we be-
lieve that a review paper covering the key progress on the develop-
ment of adsorption kinetic models, the study of adsorption mech-
2  adsorbents, the design and
anisms, the synthesis of efficient CO
process optimization of adsorption/desorption reactors, and system
integration would be highly valuable.

This review is structured as follows. In Section 2 , the research
2  adsorbents is presented. Spe-
status of elevated-temperature CO
cial attention is paid to LDOs-based materials, which appear to be
one of the most suitable adsorbent candidates for ET-PSA. Progress
on  the  understanding  of  adsorption  mechanisms  and  adsorption
models  are  discussed  according  to  three  controversial  problems:
the enhancement of alkali metal promotion, the adsorption mech-
2 O, and the adsorption kinetics. Possi-
anism in the presence of H
ble improvements of LDOs for CO
2 capacity using advanced design
and  fabrication  are  then  illustrated.  In  Section  3 ,  studies  on  the
design  of  adsorption/catalysis  hybrid  columns  for  ET-PSA  are  re-
viewed. The discussion focuses on how to achieve efficient CO/CO
2
purification without consuming H
2 . First, current purification tech-
nologies are reviewed and their common advantages/disadvantages
are discussed. The concept of adsorbent/catalyst hybrid systems for
CO and CO
2 co-purification is then illustrated, and recent progress
on thermodynamics, experiments, and modeling are analyzed. In
Section 4 , the system performance of ET-PSA, including both the
system efficiency (HP and HRR) and the purification energy con-
sumption are reviewed. First, the trade-off between the HP an HRR
in normal temperature PSA (NT-PSA) is summarized, and new PSA
strategies  based  on  one-train  and  two-train  ET-PSA  is  discussed.
The second topic is the quantitative evaluation of the energy con-
sumption of ET-PSA, including through the standard method, and a
comparison with conventional purification technologies and the ef-

fect of process optimization. Finally, in Section 5 , major challenges
and perspectives for ET-PSA based on the research/engineering ex-
periences of the authors for the fundamental study and pilot-scale
ET-PSA development are reviewed.

2. Advanced adsorbent materials and their design and
fabrication

2.1. Introduction of CO 2 adsorbents

A promising CO

2  adsorbent for applications in ET-PSA should
have properties such as a large CO
2 working capacity at elevated
2 adsorp-
temperatures, fast adsorption/desorption kinetics, low CO
tion heat, high selectivity, and high cyclic stability [17] . Currently,
CO
2  adsorbents  for  pre-combustion  carbon  capture  mainly  in-
clude carbon based adsorbents, zeolites, metal organic frameworks
(MOF), alkali metal carbonates, amine-based solid adsorbents, lay-
ered double oxides, double salts, metal oxides (CaO, MgO, etc.), and
lithium metal oxides (Li
4 , etc.) [11] . Fig. 2 shows typ-
ical adsorption capacities and adsorption/desorption temperatures

2 adsorbents.

It  is  generally  recognized  that  the  adsorption  of  physical  ad-
sorbents such as activated carbon [19] , alumina [21] , and zeolites
[20] is weak and sensitive to temperature. Some studies attempted
to  improve  the  selectivity  of  physical  adsorbents  and  enhance
their  interaction  with  CO
2  using  surface  chemical  modifications,
2  adsorption  capacities  at  elevated  temperatures
but  their  CO
(0.1–0.3 mmol/g) are still too low to be commercialized [18,27–29] .
MOFs are a new class of porous materials, which have a very high
surface area and adjustable surface functional groups [30] . These
physical  properties  lead  to  extremely  high  adsorption  capacities.
2 at room
For instance, MOF-177 could capture 33.5 mmol/g of CO
temperature  and  35 bar  [31] .  When  applied  in  pre-combustion
carbon  capture,  however,  the  selective  adsorption  of  CO
2  in  the
presence  of  water  is  a  great  challenge  [32] .  In  addition,  MOFs
face  problems  such  as  poor  chemical  and  thermal  stability  [33] .
To  date,  there  are  no  reports  on  the  elevated-temperature  CO
2
adsorption on MOF-based materials.

Chemical adsorbents such as calcium oxide [24] , lithium-based
materials  [25] ,  and  sodium-based  materials  [26]  exhibit  a  high
adsorption  performance  at  elevated  temperatures,  but  their  ap-
plications  are  limited  by  poor  reversibility,  slow  kinetics,  and  a
large energy demand for thermal regeneration. LDOs, which derive
from  layered  double  hydroxides  (LDHs),  have  a  long  research
history as elevated-temperature CO
2  adsorbents since the end of
last  century  [29,34] .  LDOs  achieve  a  good  balance  between  the
2  capacity  and  the  reversibility,  owing  to  the  moderate  CO
CO
2
adsorption heat between that of zeolites and alkali metal oxides
[11] .  The  CO
2  uptake  of  LDOs  has  reached  60–70%  of  the  total
adsorption  capacity  in  less  than  10 min  [35] ,  which  is  especially

and A n − is the interlayered anion. Owing to a flexible composition
and “memory effect” feature, LDH has been widely applied in drug
delivery  [51] ,  as  a  catalyst  [52] ,  for  waste  water  treatment  [53] ,
energy storage [54] , and as a fire retardant additive [55] . LDH is
synthesized through a series of methods including co-precipitation
[56] , urea hydrolysis [57] , sol-gel [58] , ion exchange [59] , calcina-
tion reduction [60] , and reverse micro-emulsion [61] , followed by
different  aging  processes  including  hydrothermal  treatment  [62] ,
microwave  irradiation  [63] ,  and  sonication  [64] .  Annually,  thou-
sands of tons of commercial LDH are produced by companies such
as  BASF,  Sasol,  Clariant,  Kisuma  Chemicals,  Sakai  Chemical,  etc.
[13] . In particular, the MgAl-CO
3  family, which is the most com-
mon  and  inexpensive  LDH,  has  been  recognized  as  an  excellent
candidate  for  CO
2  adsorption.  One  of  the  commercial  sources  of
MgAl-CO
3 from Sasol, Germany, is named MG x , where x represents
the MgO and Al

3 mass ratio.

2 O and H
2 S, on the CO
2 O  could  even  increase  the  CO

suitable for application in pressure swing adsorption. Due to the
2 /H
weak chemisorption feature, LDOs exhibit extremely high CO
2
selectivity  [36] .  There  is  no  negative  influence  of  gas  impurities
2  adsorption of LDOs,
in syngas, such as H
as  the  presence  of  H
2  adsorption
capacities  [37]  and  the  H
2 S  can  be  co-removed  with  different
adsorption sites [38,39] . High strength was required for adsorbent
particles to avoid crushing after cyclic high-pressure gas flushing,
and  commercial  LDOs  could  reach  very  low  performance  degra-
dation  after  thousands  of  adsorption/desorption  cycles  [40,41] .
Because of these excellent physical and chemical properties, LDOs
are commonly selected as CO

2 adsorbent candidates for ET-PSA.

MgO is another candidate for an elevated-temperature CO

2 ad-
sorbent. The CO
2 adsorption capacity of pure MgO at 200 °C is only
0.24 mmol/g [42] . Harada et al. [43] and Vu et al. [44] found that
coating  alkali  metal  nitrates  with  low  melting  points  largely  in-
creases the CO
2 adsorption capacity of MgO. Since then, there have
been increasing studies reporting the synthesis and characteriza-
tion of molten salts-promoted MgO for CO
2 adsorption. In a recent
breakthrough,  (Li-Na-K)NO
3 -promoted  MgO  was  synthesized  and
captured  15.7 mmol/g  at  340 °C  under  ambient  pressure  [43,45] .
An even higher CO
2  adsorption capacity, up to 16.8 mmol/g, was
reported  after  optimizing  the  ratio  of  Li/Na/K  [46] .  The  molten
salts  are  able  to  accelerate  the  CO
2  adsorption  rate  by  dissolv-
ing  the  solid  MgO  to  form  [Mg 2 + ...O 2 −]  ionic  pairs  with  much

functional  theory  calculation  that  promoting  MgO  with  Na
K
2  adsorption temper-
3  increases the allowable CO
atures due to the formation of double salts with more thermally
stable properties. Recently, molten salt-promoted MgO-CaCO

2.2. Design, fabrication and characterization of LDHs and LDOs

Also known to be a hydrotalcite-like compound, LDH is a kind
of anionic clay assembled by positively charged layers with MO
6
structure. The general formula of LDH is [ M 2+
2 ] [ A n −] x/n ·
z H 2 O , where M 2 + and M 3 + are metal cations located in the layers,

1 −x M 3+

x  ( OH )

Upon thermal treatment, LDH transforms into LDO by dehydra-
tion (70–190 °C), dehydroxylation (190–405 °C), and decarbonation
(405–580 °C) processes [65] , and LDO exhibits abundant basic sites
for the adsorption of acidic gases such as CO
2 . In 2001, Yong et al.
[37] investigated the effect of synthetic conditions and methods,
including  compositions,  M 2 + /M 3 +  ratios,  the  presence  of  H
2 O,
temperature, cycle number and chemical modification, on CO
2 ad-
sorption capacities of LDOs. The maximal CO
2 uptake of the com-
mercial LDOs (MG30, MG50, MG70) was 0.44 mmol/g at 300 °C and
1 bar [17] . Since then, there have been increasing numbers of stud-
2 adsorption capacities
ies on the synthesis of LDOs to improve CO
[11,12] . Approaches for the modification of LDOs can be classified
into changing compositions, such as using divalent cations (Mg 2 + ,
Co 2 + , Ca 2 + , Cu 2 + , Zn 2 + , Ni 2 + , etc.), trivalent cations (Al 3 + , Ga 3 + ,
Fe 3 + , Mn 3 + , etc.), and anions (CO
6 ) 4 −,
etc.) [66–73] , as well as changing synthesis conditions such as im-
plementing physical stirring, or changing pH and supports [73–77] .
After 2011, research interests shifted to the replacement of organic
anions, hybrid materials, particle size effects, and adsorption mech-
anisms [78–86] .  Table  1  lists  representative studies  of  LDOs  and
their performance for CO

2 adsorption.

In short, divalent/monovalent cations mainly affected the opti-
mal  adsorption temperature,  such  as  Li +  below 200 °C  [70] ,  and
Ca 2 +  and  Co 2 +  above  350 °C  [67] ,  whereas  trivalent  cations  af-
fected the structure evolution of LDOs during thermal treatment
[71] . Anions with larger sizes could lead to higher interlayer spac-
ing  in  LDH  precursors,  thus  making  it  easier  for  CO
2  molecules
to  diffuse  into  the  interlayer  regions  to  interact  with  the  active
sites [17] . Compared with compositions, synthesis methods have a
2 adsorption capacity of LDOs [86] . Loading
smaller effect on the CO
LDOs into supports did not significantly increase the CO
2 adsorp-
tion capacity, but the cyclic performance was improved [80] and
the mechanical stability of sorbent pellets was enhanced [83] . The
morphology  of  LDH  precursors  played  an  important  role  in  the
2  adsorption  capacities  of  LDOs.  Increasing  the  pH  above  the
CO
isoelectric point may cause rapid nucleation in a negative charge
environment,  and  led  to  a  uniform  nano-spherical  morphology
[85] .  Conversely,  a  higher  pH  may  decrease  the  surface  area  of
LDH precursors [75] . Physical stirring during co-precipitation was
found to be necessary, without which the flower-like morphology
of LDH precursors would change to a dense layered morphology
with much lower surface area [74] . By comprehensively consider-
2 adsorption capacity, thermal stability, and reversibility,

A common strategy to improve the CO

3  [95] could also enhance the CO

of  LDOs.  Qiang  et  al.  [96]  investigated  various  alkali  metal  car-
bonates  and  suggested  that  replacing  a  K
3  aqueous  solution
with  organic  solvents-dissolved  Li
3  led  to  a  better  modifica-
tion  effect.  Most  researchers  introduced  alkali  metals  into  LDOs
through  impregnation  methods.  Meis  et  al.  [97]  recommended
leaving the residual K (or Na) during the synthesis process with-
out  a  washing.  Iruretagoyena  et  al.  [98]  reported  that  2 wt.%  of
residual Na could double the CO
2 adsorption capacity of LDO. Re-
3 /LDOs were successfully synthesized using a simpli-
cently, K

2.3. CO 2 adsorption mechanism

2.3.1. Adsorption mechanism of LDOs

It was reported that LDOs contain abundant surface sites, in-
cluding sites with strong (O 2 − anions), medium (Mg-O pairs), and
low  (OH − groups)  basicity.  After  adsorbing  CO
2 ,  surface  carbon-
ates, such as unidentate, bidentate, bridged, and bicarbonate car-
bonate, with different bonding strength were formed [67] . In an
early study, Di Cosimo et al. [100] discovered that the Al 3 + content
plays an important role in determining the density of basic sites of
LDOs. As shown in Fig. 3 , MgO exhibits the highest CO
2 chemisorp-
tion capacity at both 200 and 300 °C. Increasing Al 3 + content leads
to a second maximum capacity at an Mg/Al ratio of 1. When the
Al 3 + content was low (Mg : Al > 5), the decreased basic sites of
MgO were due to the formation of surface AlO y that partially cov-
ered the Mg-O pairs. When the Mg/Al ratio was between 1 and 5,
the Al 3 +  within the MgO lattice of LDOs created defects to com-
pensate  for  the  generated  positive  charges,  making  the  adjacent
oxygen  anions  coordinatively  unsaturated.  The  decrease  of  basic
site density at high Al 3 + content (Mg : Al < 1) was due to the seg-
regation of bulk phase MgAl
4 into spinels. In later works, Meis
et al. [76,97] proved that the oxygen atoms at corners and edges of
3 with decreased coor-
the crystal structure of supported Mg
dination number exhibited stronger basicity. These results indicate

2 adsorption sites of alkali metal-modified Mg

For instance, Ebner et al. [101] suggested that the formation of a
Mg
2  adsorption rate. Meis et al.
[76,97] suggested that doping alkali metals create additional low-
coordinated oxygen sites at the surface by the partial substitution
of  Mg 2 +  with  K +  or  Na + .  Wang  et  al.  [102]  indicated  that  the
introduction of K + may lead to the replacement of OH − groups to
form Mg(Al)-O-K with weak basicity, and the reaction with O 2 − to
form Mg-O-K with strong basicity. Leon et al. [103] demonstrated
that the CO
3 Al-CO
3
are heterogeneous. However, most of these assumptions were pro-
posed based on CO
2  adsorption tests or ex-situ characterizations,
which  are  difficult  to  directly  validate.  In-situ  analytical  tech-
2 adsorption
niques are needed to gain deeper insights into the CO
mechanism  of  alkali  metal-promoted  LDOs.  It  should  be  noted
that in-situ XRD is not available in this case as there is no obvi-
ous  structure  change  of  K
2  adsorption  and
desorption  [90] .  In-situ  Fourier  Transform  Infrared  Spectroscopy
(FTIR), on the other hand, was found to be a powerful technique
to monitor the change of surface functional groups during the CO
2
adsorption  and  desorption  process  [104] .  The  free  carbonate  ion
has  an  active  IR  band  at  1415  cm −1 .  When  CO
2  is  chemisorbed
3 /LDO, the symmetry is lowered and the IR
on the surface of K
band is split into two bands on both sides of 1415 cm −1 [105] . The
splitting intervals ( (cid:6)ν
3 ) can inform on the strength of basic sites,
such as ∼100 cm −1 for unidentate, ∼300 cm −1 for bidentate, and
∼400 cm −1 for bridged species.

2 CO
ranged  the  surface  carbonates  on  Mg
3 ,  and  the  forma-
tion  of  strongly  basic  active  sites  came  from  the  interaction
between K + ions and Al centers. Following their work, Kim et al.
[107] investigated the enhancement mechanism of NaNO
3 impreg-
nation  on  LDOs  with  different  Mg/Al  ratios.  Thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) results indicated that the CO
2 adsorption capacity of
3 /MG30 at 200 °C and 1 bar (1.14 mmol/g) was 148%
30 wt.% NaNO
higher than that without impregnation, whereas the improvement
3 /MG70 (0.77 mmol/g) was only 22%. In-situ FTIR results
for NaNO
implied  that  the  enhanced  CO

2 O
impregnated  LDOs  with  increasing  Al
3  content  was  related  to

the  destabilized  structure.  During  CO

in NaNO
between the K + ion and Mg-O, which is more likely to be the CO
2
adsorption site for LDOs, should be considered.

created by the substitution of Mg 2 + with Al 3 + may be the CO
2 ad-
sorption sites of LDOs at elevated temperatures.

Gao et al. [86] proposed another possible approach for the for-
mation  of  coordinatively  unsaturated  surface  O 2 − species.  When
increasing the  calcination temperature  of  Mg
3  from  25  to
800 °C,  the  environment  of  Al 3 +  was  partly  changed  from  six-
coordinated to four-coordinated ( Fig. 4 ). Al 3 + may therefore diffuse
out of the octahedral lattice sites to the interlayer with a tetrahe-
dral structure during the thermal treatment, and the Al 3 + vacan-
cies could subsequently introduce active Mg–O species on LDOs.
This assumption successfully explained the existence of an optimal
calcination temperature, as too low temperatures cannot break the
Mg-OH and Al-OH bonds, and too high temperatures cause the for-
mation of an MgAl

4 phase with a reduced surface area.

unidentate and bridged carbonates to bulk polydentate carbonate
( νas = 1445 cm −1 , νs = 1375 cm −1 ) was observed after 1 h of ad-
sorption, which may explain the CO

in cyclic operations. During desorption, both the decomposition of
bidentate carbonate and the formation of free carbonate ions oc-
curred 4 min later than that of unidentate and bridged carbonates.
This delay may indicate that the increased number of active sites
from the decomposition of unidentate and bridged carbonates fa-
cilitated the transformation of bidentate carbonate back to free car-
bonate ions.

2.3.3. Adsorption mechanism in the presence of H 2 O

For most low-temperature physical sorbents, such as activated
2 O has an adverse effect
carbon, zeolite and MOF, the presence of H
2 capture ability. As syngas/reformed gas contains a con-
on the CO
2 O (10–30%), the hydrothermal stability of
siderable amount of H
adsorbents is required. However, the effects of H
2 ad-
sorption capacity of LDOs were difficult to quantitatively evaluated,
which may be due to (1) various testing conditions and simplifying
assumptions, (2) both the cycle time and the pre-treatment condi-
2  cyclic working capacities of LDOs, (3) the
tions affected the CO
2 O was easily neglected when investigating the ef-
adsorption of H

2 O partial pressures [17,37,91,111] . They proved
at relatively low H

presence  of  H
enhanced CO
2 O
was assumed to be due to the formation of the surface hydroxyl
[37,111] and the prevention of carbonate deposition [37] . The effect
of H
2 adsorption of alkali metal-modified LDOs was
also studied [89,106,113,114] . Contrary to previous work however,
these  authors  found  that  although  the  presence  of  low  pressure
2  adsorption  capacity  and  inhibited  the
H
deactivation  rate,  excessive  amounts  of  H
2 O  above  30%  reduced
the capacity due to the blockage of pore mouths that increased the
intra-particle diffusional resistance for CO
2  transport ( Fig. 9 ). The
presence  of  H
2 O  could  improve  the  cyclic  performance  of  LDOs
by  promoting  the  desorption  rate  [113,  115] ,  but  it  may  reduce
the  temperature  for  the  irreversible  decomposition  of  surface
carbonates  of  K
3 /LDOs,  thus  leading  to  the  decrease  of  CO
2
cyclic working capacity at high operating temperatures [116] .

Recently,  Coenen  et  al.  [112,116,120–122]  proposed  a  compli-
cated mechanism for the interactions between H

on the results of a series of designed TGA adsorption/desorption
cycles. Fixed bed experiments with the same procedure were also
conducted to verify the composition of the outlet gases. Accord-
ing to the results, at least four different adsorption sites were re-
quired to fully understand the CO

behaviors  [120] .  As  shown  in  Fig.  11 ,  sites  A  and  B  referred  to

lower  than  the  adsorption  rate,  therefore  this  was  the  limiting
step for the cyclic working capacity. Conversely, the working ca-

The CO 2 adsorption/desorption behavior of Mg 3 Al-CO 3 in dry-, wet-, and wet mixed-gas conditions was
investigated. Mg 3 Al-CO 3 was able to adsorb 0.38 mmol/g of H 2 O at atmospheric pressure . The CO 2
adsorption capacities of Mg 3 Al-CO 3 in dry and wet conditions were 0.61 and 0.71 mmol/g, respectively.
High pressure adsorption capacities of CO 2 and H 2 O separately on K 2 CO 3 /MG30 were measured using a
high pressure TGA. By fixing the adsorption time at 30 min, the cyclic working capacity of H 2 O
(1.06 mmol/g, p H 2 O = 4.2 bar) exceeded that of CO 2 (0.47 mmol/g, p C O 2 = 8 bar).
The CO 2 adsorption capacity of Mg 2 Al-CO 3 was 0.1 mmol/g higher in the presence of H 2 O than at dry
conditions.
The CO 2 adsorption capacity of K 2 CO 3 /MgAl-CO 3 was 10% higher in the presence of H 2 O than in dry feed
conditions and was insensitive to the H 2 O concentration.
An increase of 10–17% for the CO 2 adsorption capacity of commercial K 2 CO 3 /MG61 in the presence of H 2 O
was observed with a maximum value of 0.97 mmol/g. The presence of 20 vol.% H 2 O reduced the desorption
time of K 2 CO 3 /MG61 by a factor of 7 to achieve full regeneration.
The CO 2 adsorption capacity of K 2 CO 3 /Na 2 CO 3 /Mg 3 Al-CO 3 was 1.109 mmol/g under wet conditions.
By replacing the inert gas purge with the steam purge, the CO 2 adsorption capacity of K 2 CO 3 /MG30 could
be recovered to its initial value.
K 2 CO 3 /LDOs with higher Al 2 O 3 contents showed higher thermal stability, and thus were beneficial in
long-term operation in the presence of H 2 O.
A high CO 2 adsorption capacity for K 2 CO 3 /MG70 in the presence of high H 2 O pressure ( > 15 mmol/g,
p C O 2 = 20 bar, p H 2 O = 20 bar) was detected with a carbonation procedure under hydrothermal conditions.
A CO 2 adsorption capacity of 11.6 mmol/g for K 2 CO 3 /MG70 ( p C O 2 = 3.4 bar, p H 2 O = 13.4 bar) was reported
after 900 adsorption/desorption PSA cycles based on the integral of released CO 2 in the final steam purge.

to study the carbonate species on the surface of LDO, this was the

on CO
rectly subtract the contribution of background gas from the sam-
ple spectrum, otherwise the 1600 cm −1 and 3600 cm −1 bands may
cover up the information regarding surface carbonate. Upon expo-

ties [34,129] , the hysteresis for the desorption isotherm [101] , and
various diffusional time constants in the literature [34,89,124,130] .
Several modified models were then proposed but were still based

which  contained  an  exothermic  physical  adsorption  and  an  en-
dothermic  chemical  reaction  ( Eq.  (6) ).  Both  the  two  parts  were
based on Langmuir equations with adsorption heats of 40.0 kJ/mol

[72] , but the Henry’s law constant at 400 °C is much higher than

The  LDF  model  was  also  not  accurate  to  fit  the  CO
2  adsorp-
tion kinetics of LDOs due to lack of insight into the CO
tion phenomena. Ding et al. [89] ascribed this deviation mainly to
the simplified consideration of intra-particle diffusion. After mod-
ifying the mass-transfer coefficient with molecular, Knudsen and
surface diffusion, the model successfully predicted the CO
2 adsorp-
3  at 400–450 °C and 0–0.6 bar of

model (BPM) and homogeneous surface diffusion model (HSDM),
respectively. The BPM, which considered the existence of both dif-
fusion in the intercrystalline porous region and microparticle dif-
fusion, offered a more accurate fitting.

Another idea is to use the deactivation model to describe the
2 adsorption kinetics of LDOs [67,131] . The model assumes that
CO
2 adsorption due
the activity for LDOs decreases with ongoing CO
2 diffusion resistance and the increased prod-
to the increased CO

adsorption and no axial dispersion, the deactivation rate constant
k
0 can be calibrated by Eq. (8) us-
d and the initial sorption rate k

ever, there is no direct evidence that the existence of the prod-

van Selow et al. [118] demonstrated that there are two CO
2  ad-
sorption steps for MG70 at 400 °C, a fast adsorption step with a
low adsorption capacity followed by a slow adsorption step with
a  high  adsorption  capacity.  Miguel  et  al.  [132]  and  Silva  et  al.
[128]  observed  the  same  phenomenon  for  CO
2  adsorption  on
K
3 at 300 °C, and proposed a kinetic model through
the mathematical fitting of experimental data, assuming that the
3  was  a  fast  process  fol-
adsorption  of  CO
lowed by a slower sorption ( Eq. (9) ). The kinetic model that en-
compasses  the  two  reactions  fitted  well  with  experimental  data
up to 0.2 bar. In fact, in-situ FTIR results have indicated that four
2 adsorption, including uni-, bi-
carbonates were formed during CO
,  bridged,  and  polydentate  carbonates  [109] .  The  first  three  car-
bonates were linked with the fast reversible CO
2  uptake and the
polydentate  carbonate  was  associated  with  the  slow  irreversible
uptake. The bridged and unidentate carbonates eventually trans-
formed to polydentate carbonate after 1 h.

Ebner  et  al.  [101,133]  observed  that  with  an  increase  of

a balance, even after 700 min of CO
2  adsorption. Based on these
observations,  a  reversible  non-equilibrium  kinetic  (RNEK)  model,
including  three  completely  reversible,  high  coupled,  and  kinet-
ically  limited  reactions,  was  proposed.  As  shown  in  Fig.  13 (a),
2  was  first  fast  chemisorbed  on  the  surface  of
the  gas  phase  CO
K
2 (ad)). The equilibrium for
this chemisorption step was reached immediately and its degree
depended on the CO
2 partial pressure and temperature. Two moles
of A were then consecutively transformed to more stable phases
via  an  intermediate  reaction  of  A + E  →  B  and  a  slow  reaction
of A + B  →  C. Fig. 13 (b) illustrates the change of each carbonate

In a later study, mathematical expressions containing 12 param-

model assumed that the fast chemisorption (A ↔ CO

transfer limited, and that the slow reaction (C ↔ B + A ) and inter-
mediate reaction (B ↔ A + E ) were of a Langmuir-Hinshelwood type
[133] . After calibrating with a 700 min adsorption/700 min desorp-
tion  experiment  at  400 °C,  the  model  successfully  predicted  the

The applicability of this model was also extended to larger tem-

limited inlet flow rate may cover up the CO
2 adsorption kinetics.
Breakthrough tests based on the fixed bed were also not a satisfy-
ing choice, as the shape of the breakthrough curve was affected by
both the adsorption properties at different pressures and the mass
transfer properties of the fixed bed. Recently, Zhu et al. [35] pro-
posed a novel testing device for high pressure adsorption kinetics,
which was based on a modified static bed. As shown in Fig. 15 , the
setup contained two volume-calibrated and temperature-controlled
tubes, where a given amount of adsorbents was loaded into the
adsorption tube. Before testing, CO
1 was
filled into the reference tube. After the temperature T became sta-
ble,  the  stop  valve  between  the  two  tubes  was  opened  and  the
2  instantly filled the adsorption tube. The pressure of the two
CO
tubes dropped immediately to p

2.4.2. High pressure adsorption model

Although there have been many experimental and simulation
2  adsorption of LDOs, most of the pro-
studies concerning the CO
posed adsorption models focused on relatively low operating pres-
2 capture or high purity H
sures. Note that in pre-combustion CO
2
production from carbon-based fuels, the CO
2 partial pressure of the
syngas is usually 10–15 bar. It is not appropriate to use the nor-
mal pressure adsorption model directly in these conditions. How-
ever, the development of a high pressure kinetic model faced ex-
perimental challenges. The most straightforward method to obtain
the adsorption kinetics, namely high pressure TGA, suffered from
2  at
the displacement effect. While switching the inlet gas to CO
the beginning of experiments, the low displacing rate due to the

2 adsorption kinetics of K

Note that the pressure equalizing step in this method could be
completed within seconds, and the replacement effect was there-
fore avoided. By controlling the loading of adsorbents, the change
of p
2  should be microscopically large to guarantee the measure-
ment  accuracy  but  macroscopically  small  to  keep  the  operating
pressure relatively stable. In addition, methods for the error cor-
rection, such as the temperature deviation caused by the dead vol-
2  leak-
ume  of  the  pipelines  exposed  to  the  atmosphere  and  CO
age,  were  also  put  forward  [35] .  By  using  the  proposed  testing
method, the CO
3 /MG30 under the op-
erating conditions of 300–450 °C and 1–20 bar were obtained for
the  first  time.  Fig.  16  shows  that  the  CO
2  uptake  in  all  condi-
tions were in proportion to the logarithm of the adsorption time,
which indicated that the CO
3 /MG30
at high pressures also followed the Elovich equation. The desorp-
tion rate was much slower than the adsorption rate, which led to
irreversible adsorption capacities at a limited cycle time. When in-
creasing the temperature, both the adsorption and desorption rate
increased, and therefore the total working capacities increased. The
increased CO
2 partial pressure also promoted the adsorption rate,
but the improvement decreased after 10 bar. A simplified one-step
Elovich-type kinetic model with nine fitting parameters was then
proposed, which successfully explained the effect of temperature

build a CO
The model contained a low pressure surface adsorption part and
a high pressure nanopore adsorption part, where the surface sites
adsorbed  either  CO
2 O  with
a  Freundlich  isotherm,  and  competitive  adsorption  described  by
Dubinin–Astakhov  equation  was  expected  in  nanopores.  The  pa-
rameters were calibrated by breakthrough experiments at 400 °C
and 0.5–24 bar, feeding CO
2 O mixtures ( Fig. 17 ).
Despite many studies that proved that the presence of low pres-
sure steam promoted the CO
2 adsorption of LDOs by forming hy-
droxides  [17,89,91,111,139] ,  evidence  showed  that  at  high  steam
pressures, competitive adsorption between CO
2 O occurred
[41] .  In  addition,  the  model  successfully  verified  that  high  pres-
sure steam was able to desorb trace amounts of remaining CO
2 on
the adsorbents, a CO
2 O interaction which was experimentally
observed by Ding et al. [89] and Reddy et al. [111] . However, the
accurate measurement of isotherms by a bench-scale setup mea-
suring 6 m in height and 38 mm in internal diameter was a signifi-
cant challenge, and the testing device was complicated in order to
prevent steam condensation from occurring during the whole ex-
periment.

As  previously  mentioned,  Coenen  et  al.  [120]  proposed  four
sites for the adsorption of H
3 /MG30 from the
2 O and CO
results  of  TGA,  and  verified  their  chemical  components  using  in
situ FTIR. Recently, these authors developed a kinetic model based
on the multi-site theory [140] . The model adopted the Elovich-type
equation to describe the heterogeneous surface sites and the Fre-
undlich isotherm for the reversible adsorption of H
2 O (site A) and
CO
2 O was described
by a third site, C. As shown in Eqs. (19) and (20) , the adsorption
rate for site C contained an adsorption part with a total capacity
2 O, and
of q
a desorption part. The developed kinetic model was quite accurate
to describe TGA experiments at 0–1 bar and 30 0–50 0 °C, and was
meaningful as it was the first kinetic model that described the ad-
2 O.
sorption/desorption performance of CO
However, the proposed model was still too simple to cover all com-
plicated adsorption behaviors of CO
2 O [133,134] . In particu-
lar, more parameters were needed to give better descriptions of the
desorption performance. In addition, experiments at higher pres-
sures were required to calibrate the kinetic model if its terminal
application was the adsorption column for ET-PSA.

Despite great effort s on the optimization of material chemistry,
2 capacities of LDOs are still too low to be comparable with
the CO
the industrial standard (monoethanol amine, MEA) [141] . Currently,
the average CO
3 at 20 0–40 0 °C
2 adsorption capacities of MgAl-CO
with and without K
3 impregnation are only 0.5 [17,78,142] and
0.8 mmol/g [36,73] , respectively. Silva et al. [128,143] reported that
3  with  microwave  aging  reached  an  ad-
K
sorption capacity of 2.09 mmol/g at 3.10 bar and 300 °C, which was
3 ( Fig. 18 ). The partial substitution
twice the amount of Mg
of Al 3 + by Ga 3 + was previously reported to enhance the CO
2 ad-
sorption  capacity  of  K
3  at  elevated  temperatures
3 /Mg
due to a synergic effect, where the doped K + ions promoted chem-
ical properties of adsorption sites and the substituted Ga 3 +  ions
provided  a  robust  superstructure  with  higher  stability  [132,144] .
The enhancement of CO
2 adsorption capacity using microwave ir-
radiation or ultrasonication during precipitation synthesis was due
to the disruption of the layer stacking of LDH precursors, which
effectively exposed their internal surfaces [145] .

The conventional LDH precursors commonly exhibited a highly

areas. If the basic sites hidden in the interlayers could be exposed,

a considerable improvement of adsorption capacity could be ex-
pected. By keeping the pH of the precipitation solution higher than
the isoelectric point, the structure of Mg
3  changed from a
platelet-like  morphology  to  nano-sized  spheres,  and  the  surface
area  increased  to  103  m 2 /g.  The  CO
2  adsorption  capacity  of  the
3 at 200 °C and 1 bar before and after impreg-
modified Mg
nating with 20 wt.% K
3 reached 0.83 and 1.21 mmol/g, respec-
tively  [85] .  Another  facile  method  was  using  long  carbon-chain
organic anions to expand the interlayered space of LDH precursors
[78] . Upon thermal treatment, the organic anions decomposed and
the LDH layers with reduced interlayer forces collapsed, forming
a  more  amorphous  structure.  Recently,  Qin  et  al.  [146]  and  Li
et al. [147] investigated the effect of organic anions with different
carbon  atoms.  They  concluded  that  with  the  increase  of  carbon
atoms from 8 to 16, the interlayer distance of Mg
3 Al-C x increased
from 2.64 to 4.28 nm and the CO
2  adsorption capacity increased
from  0.45 mmol/g  to  0.91 mmol/g  at  200 °C  and  1 bar.  The  in-
creased gallery height also favored the diffusion of K ions into the
bulk phase of LDHs to modify the hidden basic sites [92,146,147] .
After  doping  with  12.5 wt.%  K

and 90% higher than that of Mg

Optionally, the surface area could be increased if the LDH was
directly exfoliated into layers or thin nanosheets using “top-down”
or  “bottom-up” methods  [148] .  Theoretical  calculations  for  LDH
indicate that the specific surface area would be dramatically in-
creased to more than 500 m 2 /g if the number of stacked layers
was  less  than  3  and  the  particle  size  was  smaller  than  60 nm
[149] .  However,  exfoliated  LDH  layers  are  easily  re-stacked  after
drying due to the high surface charge and hydrophilicity [150] . A
possible method to stabilize the exfoliated layers is to load them
into carbon-based substrates with high surface area, such as car-
bon nanofibers (CNF) [76,97] , graphene oxide (GO) [82,98,151–154] ,
multi  walled-carbon  nanotubes  (MWCNT)  [79,98,155] ,  activated
carbon (AC) [83] , and hybrid materials [156] . LDO/GO was found to
2 adsorption, where the exfoli-
be one of the best materials for CO
ated graphene oxide (GO) flakes with negative charges formed self-
assembly “layer-by-layer” 2D nanostructures [82,157] ( Fig. 19 ). The
comparative charge density of LDH and GO led to either single-
sided or double-sided coatings. Upon mixing only 7 wt.% GO, the
3 /GO compounds increased by
2 Al-CO
CO
62% [82] . Iruretagoyena et al. [98] indicated that the enhancement
mechanism of GO was due to better thermal stability, which pre-
vented the loss of site heterogeneity over thermal cycling. The ad-
dition of alkalis such as Na, K or Cs increased the CO

provide a more robust structure with increased surface areas that promoted the
thermal stability of exfoliated LDHs. With a GO:MWCNT loading ratio of 1:1, the

aqueous  miscible  organic  (AMO)  solvents  to  wash  the  wet  LDH
slurry in-situ during the co-precipitation synthesis procedure. The
treated LDH was re-dispersed in the same AMO solvent to thor-
oughly remove the interlayer water with relatively strong hydro-
gen bonds. The solvent was then evaporated during the subsequent
vacuum drying, leaving the LDH layers easy to slide. The AMO sol-
vent treatment led to an extremely high surface area of LDH pre-

solvent treatment could also be applied for the synthesis of cata-
lysts with core-shell compounds, where porous materials such as
silica [160,161] and zeolite [162] serve as the core and LDH serves
as the shell. Despite the potential of AMO-LDH for CO
2  capture,
there  are  currently  only  a  few  published  papers  using  a  similar
concept. Very recently, Zhu et al. [163] investigated the AMO sol-
vent treated-LDOs with three different Mg/Al ratios, and found that

types of AMO solvents should be tested, the process parameters

In addition, during K

partial reconstruction was found to occur on the exfoliated LDH
layers. New impregnating methods, such as in situ impregnation

to avoid the structural re-stacking.

Molten metal nitrates have been applied in the modification of
MgO and double salts, which improved the CO

ties to 5–15 mmol/g [45,48,164,165] . The molten salts were able to
dissolve CO

to  ions,  and  thus  greatly  accelerated  the  CO

3.1. Methods for CO purification from H 2 -rich gas

2 , H

The conventional process for coal to hydrogen is complicated
and energy consuming. The syngas produced from coal gasification
mainly contains CO, CO
2 , and is cooled to room tem-
2 O, and H
perature or even negative temperature after WGS to meet the tem-
2  absorption  units,  and
perature  requirement  of  conventional  CO
subsequently reheated. Optionally, if CO
2  is removed at elevated
temperatures (200–450 °C) by solid sorbents, the sensible heat loss
of syngas can be avoided and the process can be shortened. How-
ever, the shifted gas after the WGS reactor contains over 70% CO
2
2 , which inhibits the further conversion of CO to CO
2  and
and H
H
2  [7] .  Additional  CO  purification  units  are  therefore  needed  to
remove the residual trace CO, which may otherwise degrade the
electrochemical  performance  of  catalysts  in  the  subsequent  syn-
thesis  or  power  units.  The  current  CO  purification  technologies
for H
2 -selective membranes, normal temper-
ature pressure swing adsorption (NT-PSA), CO-selective methana-
tion  (CO-SMET),  and  CO  preferential  oxidation  (CO-PROX)  [168–
171] . Table 5 compares the pros and cons of different purification
technologies.

2 -rich gas include H

The development of H

2 -selective membrane technologies is still
in  early  stages  as  the  commercialization  of  large-scale  selective
H
2  membranes,  which  are  commonly  dense  phase  metal  mem-
branes,  was  limited  by  fast  permeability  degradation,  low  mass
transfer  surface  area,  and  ease  to  fracture  [172,173] .  In  addition,
the representative noble metals for membranes, Pd [174] and Pd
alloys [175] , commonly suffer poor resistance to H
2 S and CO. The
2 -selective membranes can be coupled into the WGS reaction to
H
increase the CO conversion rate and reduce the CO
2  capture cost
[176] . The long-term operation of WGS membrane reactors relies
on  thermally,  mechanically,  and  chemically  stable  membranes,
which are able to work at high temperatures and pressures as well
as in harsh gas conditions. However, the HRR (40–90%) of zeolite
based  membranes,  which  were  considered  the  most  attractive
materials  for  membrane  reactors,  was  restricted  by  the  low  H

permeability  (0.9–2.9 × 10 −2 mol/(s  m 2  bar))  [177–180] .  Another
physical purification technology, NT-PSA, has been widely adopted
in the USA, Spain, France, Argentina, China, Brazil, etc., to produce
hydrogen  from  gases  with  60–90%  H
2  [181] .  When  a  high  HP
above  99.999%  is  required,  the  NT-PSA  suffers  problems  such  as
low HRR ( < 90%), with a complex system and high cost.

Chemical  purification  technologies  such  as  CO-SMET  and  CO-
2 , but
PROX are preferable for the purification of fuel cell-grade H
they inevitably consume H
2  due to the chemical similarity of H
2
and  CO  [170,171] .  For  example,  to  purify  one  mole  of  CO,  three
moles of H
2  are consumed in CO-SMET. In addition, using noble
metals  such  as  Au  [182,183] ,  Pt  [184] ,  Ir  [185]  and Ru  [186]  as
catalysts for the chemical CO purification leads to high capital in-
vestment. Recent progress has involved replacing the noble metal
catalysts with transition metal oxides [187–194] , but the high CO
leakage in the product hydrogen remains a problem. For CO-SMET,
despite a very low inlet CO concentration ( < 0.5 vol.%), the residual
CO concentration was still 30–50 ppm [195] .

When most of the CO

2  in the syngas is separated at elevated
temperatures, the restriction for the WGS thermodynamic equilib-
rium is circumvented based on Le Chatelier’s principle. One fea-
sible method to indirectly purify the CO is therefore to add WGS
catalysts into the CO
2  adsorption columns ( Fig. 21 ). By removing
2 in-situ in the working conditions of the WGS reaction, the CO
CO
can be simultaneously converted to CO
2  and then removed in a
single purification unit [196] . There are two advantages of the ad-
sorbent/catalyst system: (1) conventional CO purification technolo-

2 ,  as  illustrated  previously  [181] ,
gies  usually  consume  10–20%  H
2 owing
whereas the proposed system even produces additional H
to a higher CO conversion rate; (2) the residual CO concentration
for the hybrid system depends on the performance of CO
2 adsor-
bents and the S/G ratio, and it is easy to reach an extremely low
level [197,198] .

3.2. Thermodynamic study of WGS with CO 2 capture

The  concept  of  combining  CO

2  adsorbents  and WGS  catalysis
in  a  single  adsorption-reaction  column  is  similar  to  the  SEWGS
2 capture, which was first proposed in 1931
for pre-combustion CO
[199] , developed by Air Products in the 1990s [34] , and scaled by
ECN  [200] .  Fixing  the  temperature  at  400 °C  and  CO  conversion
rate at 95%, the S/C ratio could be reduced from 2.5:1 in the ab-
sence of adsorbents to 1.3:1 with 75% of CO
2 capture ratio [201] .
Jang et al. [202] performed a thermodynamic calculation and in-
dicated that the CO equilibrium concentration in the WGS reaction
by fixing the S/C ratio at 3 is more than 60 0 0 ppm at 300 °C. When
the CO
2  capture ratio reaches 99%, the residual CO concentration
reduced to 130 ppm. Stevens et al. [201] reported a similar con-
clusion that a 99% CO conversion with an S/C ratio of 2:1 could
be achieved even at 600 °C if 99% of CO
2 was captured in-situ. Lu
et al. [203] identified seven candidate adsorbents for elevated tem-
perature CO
2  capture, which were able to achieve a 98% carbon
capture ratio at 400 °C and lead to over 98% CO conversion in the
adsorbent/catalyst column. The WGS reaction commonly suffered

By  co-feeding  methanol  into  the  adsorbent/catalyst  reactor,
there were additional thermodynamic benefits as the heat released
by the CO
2  adsorption and WGS reaction could be consumed by
the  steam  reforming  of  methanol  to  enhance  the  hydrogen  pro-
ductivity [206] . Advantages of using sorption enhanced processes
to drive the reaction limitations were also discovered in reforming
(SER) of methane [207–212] , biomass [213,214] , glycerol [215,216] ,
bio-oil [217] , and ethanol [218–223] . However, SEWGS was more
thermodynamically suitable due to the best fit of the working tem-
peratures of WGS catalysts and LDO-based CO

2 adsorbents [207] .

On the other hand, the adsorbent/catalyst hybrid system is ap-
plied to produce high purity hydrogen, the requirement for the car-
bon capture ratio is much higher than that of SEWGS. Note that
2 was affected by
the residual CO concentration in the produced H
2 capture ratios, and
operating conditions such as temperature, CO
steam-to-carbon (S/C) ratios in the feed gas. The detailed descrip-
tion of the chemical equilibrium was therefore necessary to design
efficient purification units. The WGS equilibrium constant with in
situ CO

2 capture is represented by Eq. (27) .

Zhu et al. [197] evaluated the WGS thermodynamic equilibrium
with feeding gases consisting of 5% CO, 95% Ar/H
2 , and an S/G ratio
of 1–5, and found that the balanced CO concentration is between
0.1–1% for Ar as the balanced gas and between 1 and 10% for H
2
as the balanced gas. Later, the WGS equilibrium with in-situ CO
2
capture was calculated [198] . As shown in Fig. 22 , the WGS bal-
anced CO concentration at 400 °C without CO
2  capture exceeded
4%. To reduce the residual CO concentration to less than 1%, multi-
stage WGS configurations with lower operating temperatures have
to be adopted in actual industries, which would inevitably degrade
the reaction kinetics. Alternatively, if more than 99.99% of CO
2 (ap-
proximately 100 ppm of residual CO
2 concentration) is removed in
situ without changing the temperature, the residual CO concentra-
tion could be lowered below 10 ppm.
Note  that  the  maximum  CO

2  capture  ratio  of  chemical  ad-
sorbents was determined by the reaction equilibrium CO
2  partial
pressure  at  a  given  temperature  [205] .  However,  the  theoretical
2 balanced pressure of LDOs was challenging

as it was difficult to clarify the structure and thermodynamic pa-
rameters of the adsorption product of LDOs. Zhu et al. [198] pro-
vided another way to experimentally measure the thermodynamic
2 partial pressure by breakthrough tests. When in-
equilibrium CO
creasing the fixed bed residence time by reducing the feed gas flow
2  molecules in the fixed bed bulk phase could reach
rate, the CO
pseudo-thermodynamic equilibrium. The residual CO
2 in the prod-
2  was ascribed to the dy-
uct gas before the breakthrough of CO
namic adsorption/desorption balance between the bulk phase CO
2
and  the  chemisorbed  CO
2  on  the  surface  of  LDOs.  Results  from
breakthrough tests under different adsorption and desorption con-
ditions  indicated  that  the  residual  CO
2  concentration  highly  de-
pended on the purge gas amount. Steam purge was found to en-
2  working  capacities,  but  no  direct  evidence
hance  the  cyclic  CO
suggested that it had a better effect on the recovery of residual
2 concentration. After purging with Ar at 400 °C overnight, the
CO
residual  CO
2  concentration  at  400 °C  and  20 bar  was  reduced  to
8.5 ppm, which was equal to 1.7 × 10 −4 bar of thermodynamically-
2 partial pressure ( Fig. 23 ). When increasing the des-
balanced CO
orption  temperature  to  450 °C,  the  residual  CO
2  concentration
could be further reduced to 3.2 ppm.

3.3. Adsorption/catalysis hybrid column

Despite  the  enthusiasm  towards  developing  new  CO

2  adsor-
bents with higher capacities, researchers have paid less attention
to  the  control  of  residual  CO  and  CO
2  concentrations  ( Table  6 ).
Early studies confirmed the possibility of producing hydrogen with
simultaneous  CO
2  removal  using  dolomite  precursor,  where  the
CO
2 was trapped by the bulk reaction of CaO carbonation and the
MgO  in  the  calcined  dolomite  could  be  used  as  the  WGS  cata-
lyst [224–227] . However, complete removal of residual CO/CO
2 us-
ing  CaO  based  adsorbents  was  thermodynamically  restricted  by
high operating temperatures. For instance, Han et al. [224] indi-
cated  that  the  residual  CO  and  CO
2  concentrations  of  the  fixed
bed loaded with CaO/MgO were 10 0 and 30 0 ppm, respectively, at
550 °C. Liu et al. [226,227] reported that for feeding gas consist-
2 , the CO conversion at 500–
ing of 10% CO, 20% H
600 °C with Fe
3 as the WGS catalyst and CaO as the CO
3 /Cr
2
adsorbent was 95–97%. In addition, the significant sintering prob-
lem caused by high regeneration temperatures might also decrease
2  control  ability  of  CaO  during  multiple  cycles.  Re-
the  trace  CO

The development of LDOs as elevated-temperature CO

2  adsor-
bents  offered  the  possibility  to  limit  both  the  adsorption  and
desorption  temperatures  of  adsorbent/catalyst  systems  to  200–
400 °C,  thus  promoting  CO  conversion/purification.  Beaver  et  al.
[229]  built  a  tubular  reactor  (inner  diameter:  0.0173 m;  length:
0.502 m) with 50 wt.% K
2 adsorbent and

50 wt.%  Cu/ZnO/Al
residual  CO  and  CO
2  concentrations  at  400 °C  and  1 bar  can  be
controlled to be less than 70 0 ppm and 10 0 0 ppm, respectively. An
adsorption-reaction column model that coupled the LDF equation
[36] and the empirical WGS model [230] was subsequently pro-
posed [202] . According to the simulation results, the CO conver-
sion increased with higher S/C ratios, higher adsorbent/catalyst ra-
tios, and lower temperatures. ECN conducted a 550 cyclic exper-
iment  in  a  2 m  tall  fixed-bed  with  891 g  MG70  and  434 g  Fe-Cr
catalyst [118] at 400 °C and 28 bar. When feeding with 12% CO

the CO conversion ratio remained above 99.2% over 550 cycles and
the residual CO and CO

high MgO content were easy to fracture and powder during cyclic

3 /MG30  with  a  reduced  Mg/Al  ra-
2  slips
tio  exhibited  better  mechanical  strength  and  lower  CO/CO
[40,41] . Further reducing the operating temperature led to higher
CO conversion but may cause reduced WGS reaction kinetics. Re-
cently,  Rodrigues’s  group  investigated  the  performance  of  adsor-
bent/catalyst systems by adopting WGS catalysts with higher cat-

alytic activity at low temperatures, such as Ni/Al
[231] , CuO/CeO
2 at 125–295 °C [232] , and CuO/zeolite 13X at 125–
275 °C [233] . The CO conversion rate could reach 97.7% at 275 °C
2 /CuO as the WGS catalyst when feeding with

Studies  have  also  focused  on  developing  novel  adsor-
bent/catalyst  systems.  Stevens  et  al.  [201]  demonstrated  that
sodium-promoted  CaO  pre-treated  with  steam  could  be  used  as
both a CO
2 adsorbent and catalyst, and the CO conversions of the
WGS  reaction  packing  only  NaOH/CaO  reached  99%  at  moderate
conditions  (50 0–60 0 °C  and  1–11.2 bar).  Lee  et  al.  [234,235]  de-
veloped  a  thermal  swing  sorption  enhanced  process  that  could
continuously  produce  fuel-cell  grade  H
2  owing  to  an  enhanced
desorption  performance  with  pressure  and  temperature  swing.

to avoid the uniform packing of adsorbent and catalyst. The col-
umn  was  divided  into  several  sections  packing  a  mixture  of
catalyst and adsorbent with different ratios [236] or one-body hy-
brid materials [237] . In a two-section column, both H
2 productivity
and CO conversion could be increased by packing more catalysts
in the first section and more adsorbents in the second section.

Note  that  the  main  objectives  of  studies  related  to  the  ad-
sorbent/catalyst hybrid column was to reduce the steam require-
ment for the WGS reaction without reducing the CO conversion,
2 .  The  relatively  large
rather  than  to  produce  fuel  cell  grade  H
CO/CO
2  leakage might be ascribed to unreasonable working con-
ditions such as feeding gas compositions, temperatures, pressures,
flow rates, etc. Recently, Zhu et al. [197,198,238,239] comprehen-
sively investigated the effectiveness of the hybrid system in deep
2 -rich gas. The values of residual
2 co-purification from H
CO and CO
CO and CO
2  concentrations were accurately measured on line by
an infrared gas analyzer with a measuring range of 200 ppm [197] .

3 as the WGS catalyst. By fixing the feeding gas at
cial Fe
5–20% CO and balanced Ar, and the S/C ratio at 1.25–10, the resid-
ual CO concentration in tested conditions of 350–450 °C and 10–
30 bar could be less than 10 ppm [197,239] . The CO
2 effective ca-
pacity was affected by both the total capacity and the adsorption
kinetics.  When  the  feeding  gas  CO  concentration  increased,  the
q C O
2  therefore increased but the q CO _ 10 remained relatively stable.
The CO purification ability could be enhanced by increasing the op-
eration pressure, the S/C ratio, and reducing the temperature [197] .
When the temperature exceeded 450 °C, the sharply decreased per-
formance was probably due to irreversible adsorbent decomposi-
tions at high temperature [134] . In addition, the decreased τ at an
S/C ratio of 5 was ascribed to the competitive adsorption of CO
2
and H
2 O partial pressures. The existence of a large
2 in the feeding gas would cause CO leakage due to a
amount of H
lower CO conversion and the reverse WGS reaction of the residual
CO
2  on the surface of adsorbents after regeneration. An exciting
observation was that when feeding with syngas (5.17% CO, 20.8%
CO
2 O, 1.60% Ar), the hybrid system was able
to reduce the CO concentration from 5% to below 20–80 ppm, and
did not show performance degradations in multi-cycle tests [239] .
Modelling of mixed packing columns was necessary when scal-
ing  up  the  adsorbent/catalyst  column,  as  it  was  usually  time
consuming  to  obtain  all  the  design  parameters  from  the  break-
through experiments. The column model could also provide further

insight into the purification process through the parametric study,
such  as  the  change  of  the  gas  distributions  along  the  column
length. The following assumptions were commonly adopted by re-
searchers [130,136,202,239,240] :

• The flow pattern was axially-dispersed plug flow;
• Mixed gas fitted the ideal gas behavior;
• There were no radial mass and velocity gradients;
• The adsorbent and catalyst were uniform particles;
• There were no intra-particle mass and heat gradients;
• The gas phase and solids reached thermal equilibrium.

the adsorption capacity of LDOs was much easier [113,248] . The
2 continuous purification using adsorbent/catalyst
concept of CO/CO
hybrid  columns  with  a  reduced  purge  gas  amount  was  there-
fore  proposed  ( Fig.  26 ),  which  included  co-current  adsorption,
co-current steam rinse, counter-current depressurization, counter-
current steam purge, and counter-current pressurization [198] . The
idea was to use part of the adsorbent to reversibly remove most
2 and the remaining part near the exit of the column to
of the CO
2 . High temperature steam purging was period-
control the trace CO
ically conducted to maintain the trace CO/CO
2 purification ability
of the hybrid system.

2 , CO, and CO

Table  7  lists  the  mathematical  equations  for  the  adsor-
bent/catalyst hybrid column model, obtained by integrating the gas
phase mass and momentum balance, the adsorption/catalysis ki-
netic models, as well as the dynamic boundary conditions [238] .
The proposed column model was able to accurately describe the
2 breakthrough curves with different feed gas com-
H
positions (CO/Ar or CO/H
2 ), CO concentrations (5–20%), and S/C ra-
tios (1.25–5). Note that the column model could be more complete
but more complicated by reducing the above assumptions, such as
the approaches in the studies of Zheng et al. [136] and Wu et al.
[220,223] , which considered the mass and heat transfer within the
solid particles, respectively. In addition, adiabatic [209,210,241] and
non-adiabatic [211,240,242] temperature boundary conditions were
commonly  used  in  adsorption-reaction  column  modelling.  How-
ever, breakthrough experiments indicated that when using LDOs as
CO
2 adsorbents, the rise of column temperature would not exceed
40 °C due to a low adsorption heat [118] , unless the feed gas was
syngas with a large amount of unconverted CO [243] . The assump-
tion of isothermal conditions was therefore sufficiently reasonable
[136,238,244] .

One important finding of the simulation work was that the ad-
sorption  rather  than  the  catalysis  was  the  rate-controlling  step,
that is, in all the testing conditions the WGS equilibrium of gases
was reached almost instantaneously after feeding into the column,
but the CO and CO concentration profiles were highly related to
the feed flow rates. One typical example was that when the flow
rate  was  200 mL/min,  the  residual  CO  concentration  was  below
15 ppm for over 1500s. However, when the flow rate doubled, the
residual CO concentration increased to 28 ppm within 400 s. The
column-scale simulation for 17 cases in Fig. 25 with different feed-
ing conditions also verified again that the adsorbent/catalyst hy-
brid system was able to control the residual CO concentration from
an  original  10 0 0–30,0 0 0 ppm  to  less  than  10 ppm,  although  the
utilization ratio of adsorbents was restricted by the adsorption ki-
netics.

The aforementioned results suggested that although the hybrid
system with fresh LDOs exhibited trace CO/CO
2  purification abil-
ity,  to fully  regenerate the saturated  adsorbents required signifi-
cant  gas  purging.  On  the  other  hand,  to  simply  recover  most  of

4. System-scale study

4.1. Industrial application of ET-PSA

Despite the great application prospect in pre-combustion car-
bon capture and hydrogen production, the development of ET-PSA
is  still  in  early  stages.  In  a  project  funded  by  the  United  States
Department of Energy (DE-FE0 0 0 0469), TDA Research, Inc. devel-
oped  two  pilot-scale  4-column  ET-PSAs  for  pre-combustion  CO
2
capture, which worked at 190–260 °C by adopting mesoporous car-
bon  as  a  CO
2  adsorbent  [18] .  Feeding  with  coal-derived  syngas,
the systems maintained their performance for over 1030 adsorp-
tion/desorption  cycles.  In  the  following  projects  (DE-FE0013105
and DE-FE0026142), 0.1 MW e -scale ET-PSA units were applied at
the  Wabash  River  Integrated  Gasification  Combined  Cycle  (IGCC)
power plant and at the National Carbon Capture Center coal-to-
liquid plant [249] . During 2010 to 2015, the Research Triangle Insti-
tute (RTI) carried out warm syngas cleanup demonstration projects
that successively removed H
2  at elevated temperatures
2 S and CO
[250,251] .  The  desulfurization  and  decarbonation  efficiencies  by
using ZnO as an H
2  adsorbent
were  above  99.9%  and  90%,  respectively.  Since  2005,  the  Energy
Research Centre of the Netherlands (ECN) has been scaling-up the
PSA-based sorption enhanced water gas shift (SEWGS) technology
with potassium-promoted layered double oxides (LDOs) as CO
2 ad-
sorbents [252] . The aim of the latest project, STEPWISE, is to cap-
ture  85%  CO
2  at  400 °C  and  25 bar  with  60%  lower  energy  con-
sumption from Blast Furnace Gases (BFG). Starting from 2011, our
research group conducted a series of applied basic studies on ET-
PSA  for  carbon  capture  and  hydrogen  production.  During  a  five-
year project (2011–2015) funded by the National High Technology
Research and Development Program of China, we built a 4-column
ET-PSA for pre-combustion carbon capture with a handling capac-
ity of 6 Nm 3 /h. The system successfully passed 75 h of continu-
ous operation and 10 0 0 h of accumulative operation with a 95.7%–
98.6% CO
2 S removal ratio [8] .
Since 2016, we have carried out a demonstration project named
Shanxi  Provincial  S&T  Major  Projects  (MH2015-06),  aimed  at

Fig. 25.  Predictions of CO 2 total and effective capacity for the hybrid column filled with Fe 2 O 3 /Cr 2 O 3 catalyst and K 2 CO 3 /MG30 adsorbent. The total CO 2 capacity was divided
into seven parts based on the residual CO concentration in the product H 2 . The nomenclature used for each feed condition is as follows: gas compositions–S/G ratio–flow rate.
The CO 2 total capacities were 0.5–0.6 mmol/g despite cases 5, 6, 7. A GHSV of no more than 600 h − 1
(equal to 200 mL/min) was therefore recommended [238] . Reprinted

Fig. 26.  Concept of continuous CO/CO 2 purification in H 2 -rich gas. Syngas first passed through the hybrid column to produce high purity hydrogen. After a given portion
(e.g. 80%) of the adsorbent was saturated, the bulk H 2 in the column was squeezed out by a co-current steam rinse. The column was then counter-current depressurized,
followed by a counter-current steam purge to regenerate most of the CO 2 working capacities. Finally, the column was counter-current pressurized with steam or hydrogen.
The column was periodically regenerated with high temperature steam purging to maintain the trace CO/CO 2 purification [198] . Reprinted with permission from Elsevier,

producing high purity hydrogen for ammonia synthesis with above
99.999% HP and 99% HRR from syngas with a handing capacity of
50 0 0 Nm 3 /h [253,254] . This pilot-scale ET-PSA will be finally built
by the end of 2020.

On the technology readiness level (TRL) scale analysis, the cur-
rent ET-PSA carbon capture and hydrogen production technologies
are  at  TRL  4  (lab  prototype)  and  TRL  5  (lab-scale  plant).  A  few
projects such as STEPWISE aimed to reach TRL 6 (pilot plant).

4.2. Trade-off between HP and HRR

NT-PSAs  based  on  physical  adsorbents  such  as  zeolite,  silica
gel, and activated carbon are commonly used as the last step to

produce fuel cell grade hydrogen from carbon-rich and hydrogen-
rich gases, such as refinery fuel gas, reformed gas, ethylene plant
effluent gas, and coke oven gas [255,256] . The adoption of NT-PSA
reduces the purification energy consumption due to the avoidance
of thermal regeneration in temperature swing adsorption (TSA). In
addition, the cyclic operation of NT-PSA was much faster than that
of  TSA.  NT-PSA  is  a  cyclic  process  consisting  of  multi-beds  with
several  successive  steps  [257–259] .  The  sequence  of  the  typical
Skarstrom cycle is as follows [260,261] . In the feed step, gas im-
purities are adsorbed on the surface of physical adsorbents. After
the adsorbents are saturated, the pressure of the adsorption bed
is  reduced  in  multi-stage  pressure  equalization  depressurization
steps, where the released gases are fed to other beds to recover

2 capture [264–266] . One benefit of NT-PSA is that it enables a
CO
very high HP to be reached. The residual CO and CO
2 concentration
after  treating  with  NT-PSA  could  be  reduced  from  a  percentage
level to below 10 ppm [267] . However, while achieving 98–99.999%
HP from the reformed gas, NT-PSA suffered from high complexity

and low HRR. Lee’s group investigated the effect of operating pa-
rameters (pressure, step time, purge-to-feed ratio, etc.) and steam
parameters (particle diameter, bed diameter, etc.) on bulk H
2 sepa-
ration efficiencies of NT-PSAs with a 1-bed 5-step [268,269] , 2-bed
6-step [270] , and 2-bed 7-step [271–273] configuration and the op-
timal case reached 50–75% HRR when achieving > 99.99% HP. Lively
et al. [274] developed a rapid cycle 1-bed 4-step NT-PSA by adopt-
ing a novel fiber sorbent module, and reported a much higher HRR
of 76.2% when achieving 99.99% HP from a gas mixture of 75% H
2
and 25% CO
2 in isothermal operating conditions. However, the H
2
loss on the bulk phase of beds after the adsorption step was ne-
glected in their calculation of HRR. Yang et al. [275] investigated a
4-bed 9-step NT-PSA by layered packing of activated carbon (AC)
and zeolite 5A, where the AC was mainly used for bulk removal
4 , and CO, and zeolite 5A for deep purification of the
of CO

4  and CO. The system reached 99.999% HP with 66%
residual CH
4 , 2.03% CO,
HRR from the shifted gas containing 72.2% H
and 21.6% CO
2 . A similar simulation was conducted by Park et al.
[276] , who proved that the optimal AC/zeolite ratio depended on
superficial velocity, HP and heat transfer resistance.

from 65% to 45% with decreasing feed flow rate and increasing purge to feed ratio
and longer beds. Both the HP and HRR increased with an increasing zeolite length,
within a certain value. After that, however, the same trend was observed again,
which was due to the insufficient removal of CO 2 by the AC layer [282] . Reprinted

of different operating and bed parameters on the performance of a
4-bed 8-step NT-PSA with layered packing of AC and zeolite to pro-
duce H
4 ,
CO, and N
2 . As shown in Fig. 27 , the HP of NT-PSA increased while
the HRR decreased with decreasing feed flow rate and increasing
purge-to-feed ratio,  AC  length, and  zeolite length.  The  only  case
where  the  HP  and  HRR  showed  the  same  trend  was  when  the
activated  carbon  length  was  changed  by  fixing  the  total  length
within a limiting value, and this was owing to the optimization of
adsorption layer structure. In another study, it was demonstrated
that by reducing the adsorption time from 160 to 120 s, the HP in-
creased from 99.8193% to 99.9992% while the HRR decreased from
71.8% to 62.7% [280] . In fact, the trade-off between HP and HRR
was  determined  by  a  technical  feature  of  NT-PSA.  By  increasing
the adsorption time or feed flow rate, more H
2 was recovered in
the adsorption step. On the other hand, the large amount of feed
gas  easily  caused  the  penetration  of  gas  impurities  and  reduced
the HP. By increasing the purge-to-feed ratio, which would directly
2  loss, the increased HP was due to a more thorough re-
cause H
generation. The reason for the low HRR of NT-PSA when achieving
an HP above 99.999% could be summarized as (1) limited CO2/H2
selectivity of physical adsorbents; (2) residual H2 in the bed after
the  adsorption  step;  and  (3)  the  adoption  of  H2  as  the  purge
gas.

One of the main purposes of pressure equalization steps was
2  loss in the blow down and purge steps on the CO
to avoid H
2
product, due to the remaining bulk H
2 in the adsorption bed after
the adsorption step. The HRR could therefore be improved with-
out reducing HP by increasing the number of pressure-equalization
steps.  Moon  et  al.  [286]  compared  the  performance  of  NT-PSAs
with 2-bed 6-step and 4-bed 8-step configurations, and indicated
that the HP increased from 73.30–77.64% to 79% when the num-
ber  of  pressure-equalization  steps  was  increased  from  1  to  2.
Lopes  et  al.  [285]  demonstrated  that  a  NT-PSA  with  3  pressure-
equalization  steps  achieved  81.6%  HRR  and  99.981%  HP.  Luberti
et al. [279] reported that, when fixing the HP at 99.99%, the HP of
NT-PSA increased from 73.4% to 93.0% by increasing the bed num-
ber from 4 to 12. The optimal case with a 12-bed 13-step config-
uration reached 92.7% HRR and 99.994% HP from the raw hydro-

tivity decreased with the increase in bed number from 1 to 12. A slight decrease
of HP for the 12-bed configuration was due to the breakthrough during the third

gen gas in an IGCC power plant. However, the increased pressure-
equalization depressurization steps would definitely decrease the
productivity and increase the system complexity and capital cost.
Nikolic et al. [287] provided a general framework for the design of
NT-PSA cycles with different configurations. As shown in Fig. 28 ,
improved HP ( ∼3%) and HRR ( ∼38%) were observed as the num-
ber of beds increased from 1 to 12, but the productivity decreased
from 9.18 × 10 −2 to 2.42 × 10 −2 mol/kg.s.

Another strategy to increase the HRR in NT-PSA is to reduce the
2 loss in the purge step. The conventional NT-PSA adopted the H
H
2
as the produced gas, where the tail gas containing 45%–66% CO/H
2
was used as the heat or power source from combustion. Recently,
Moon et al. [284] replaced the purge gas from the produced H
2
by  residual  gas  in  the  adsorption  bed  after  the  equalization  de-
2 purge in NT-PSA, the
pressurization steps. Compared with the H
HRR of the new configuration could be improved by ∼3–6% [284] .
However, using the residual gas as the purge gas increased the CO
2 ,  which  was  unfavorable  when
concentration  in  the  produced  H
2 loss in the purge step could also be
applied in fuel cells. The H
avoided by adopting a CO
2  reflux step, where the tail gas in the
purge step is compressed and co-currently added into the bed after
the adsorption bed to displace the residual H
2 . As the reflux step
consumes as large amount of compression energy, it is more eco-
2 capture with lower
nomic for application in post-combustion CO
adsorption pressures [288,289] .

chemisorbents,  ET-PSA  provides  a  feasible  solution  to  break  the
trade-off between  HP  and  HRR  in  NT-PSA.  First,  the  use  of
chemisorbents with high capacity and fast kinetics avoids the H

2  selectivity. Second, by increasing
loss due to the limited CO
the adsorption temperature to 200–450 °C, steam rinsing and stem
purging can be adopted, where the high pressure steam rinse af-

ter the adsorption step drives the residual H
the low pressure steam purge replaces the H

loss. The steam was chosen as the rinse/purge gas because it can
be separated by simply condensing. Several ET-PSA processes have
been proposed, including a 4-bed 8-step cycle [136] , a 6-bed 8-step

forward a 7-bed 10-step ET-PSA process to produce an H
2 -rich de-
carbonizing stream for gas turbines from the reformed gas, which
operated at 350–450 °C and 35 bar by using K
3 /MG70 and an
iron chrome catalyst ( Fig. 29 ). The proposed system adopted a co-
2  rinse  step  and  a  counter-current  steam  purge  step,
current  CO
where the high pressure CO
2 came from the compressed dry CO
2
product and the steam came from the heat recovery steam gen-
erator (HRSG) in the steam turbine system. At any particular time,
two beds were fed and one bed was purged, resulting in a constant
flow of feed and product gas being attained.

2 CO

Although the CO

2 rinse minimized the loss of H

2 , the pressure
recovery of the CO
2 product consumed a large amount of compres-
sion energy. The addition of a CO
2 rinse step also caused the re-
2  working capacity, thus increasing the size of
duction of the CO
reactors. In the European FP6 project (CACHET), van Selow et al.
[292,293] and Wright et al. [294] replaced the CO
2  rinse with a
counter-current  steam  rinse,  where  the  effluent  gas  with  a  high
CO
2 concentration was mixed with the feed gas ( Fig. 29 ). As CO
2
2 rinse step, the steam rinse reduced
was adsorbed during the CO
not only the amount of the rinse gas by half but also the amount
of purge gas. Therefore, although the use of a steam rinse caused a
power penalty, it was offset by the remove of CO
2 -product energy
consumption of the compressor.

Instead  of  the  H

2  loss  in  NT-PSA,  the  total  steam  consump-
tion for the steam rinse and steam purge steps is the major en-
ergy  source  for  ET-PSA.  Therefore,  in  the  European  PF7  project
(CAESAR),  studies  focused  on  the  sensitivity  analysis  of  operat-
ing parameters to minimize the steam consumption. Reijer et al.

[290] showed that the CO
2  capture  ratio  was  mainly  affected  by  the
flow  rate  and  the  CO
purge flow rate. While achieving a 90% CO
2  capture ratio and a
98%  CO
2  purity,  the  minimum  rinse-to-feed  (R/F)  and  purge-to-
feed (P/F) ratios for a 6-bed 8-step ET-PSA were 0.157 and 0.371,

respectively. Wright et al. [295] demonstrated that increasing the
number  of  equalization  steps  enabled  the  rinse  steam  to  be  re-
duced without significantly changing the purge steam, as the addi-
tion of equalization steps reduced the H
2 remaining inside the bed
before blow down. Another possible method to reduce the steam
consumption in ET-PSA was to develop improved adsorbents with
an  advantageous  adsorption  capacity  and  isotherm  [200,298] .  In
addition, Zheng et al. [136] proved that a 20% improved adsorp-
tion capacity increased HRR by approximately 5% when fixing the
P/F ratio.

The state of the art ET-PSA process uses the co-current steam
2  product. The rinse steam is then
rinse to produce additional H
expanded during the pressure equalization steps to transport the
syngas to the other beds, leaving relatively pure CO
2  and steam
for the depressurization step. Fig. 30 shows the 9-bed 11-step ET-
PSA process cycle and sequence with co-current steam rinse and
counter-current  steam  purge  proposed  by  Boon  et  al.  [39] .  This
process achieves continuous operation because at every moment
two beds are being fed with syngas, one bed is being rinsed, and
two beds are being purged. After coupling an adsorption model by
considering both the competitive adsorption and surface adsorp-
tion of CO
2 O [138] , these authors indicated that the effect
of the steam rinse step in ET-PSA was underestimated. By neglect-
ing the H
2 O adsorption of adsorbents, the rinse steam easily mixed
with the gases in the bed during the pressure equalization steps.
However,  if  part  of  steam  was  adsorbed  during  the  steam  rinse
step,  the  release  of  adsorbed  steam  during  the  pressure  equal-
ization steps could achieve more efficient displacement. By taking
into account the effect of H
2 O adsorption, a rinse-to-carbon ratio
of only 0.03 and a purge-to-carbon ratio of 0.08 were needed to
achieve a 95% carbon capture ratio and a 99% CO

2 and H

2 purity.

A potential challenge of the ET-PSA system is to ensure the con-
tinuity of the operation. Based on the 8-bed 11-step process pro-
posed by Wright et al. [295] , Najmi et al. [243] investigated the
dynamic behavior of ET-PSA, and observed a significant fluctuation
of  product  flow  rate  caused  by  the  H
2  consumption  for  the  re-
pressurization step, which may affect the operation of the down-
2 -
stream power unit. In particular, the fluctuation of produced H
rich  stream  was  not  allowed  when  feeding  into  the  gas  turbine
with a given output power. The H
2 production fluctuations could
be smoothed by setting a multi-train, multi-bed ET-PSA, where dif-
ferent trains run  with an  asynchronous  schedule  [296] ( Fig.  31 ).
When fixing the number of trains at 10, the “pentuple-train” con-
figuration, which operates two sets of five trains in parallel while
leaving a time lag between them, was found to reduce the fluctua-
tions from ∼±33% to ∼±14%. A “double-train” configuration could
further  reduce  the  fluctuations  to  ∼±11%  but  with  much  more
complex operating strategies. In addition, their work also showed
that  an  upstream  WGS  reactor  was  necessary  for  ET-PSA,  other-
wise the adsorbents/catalysts may be destroyed by hot spots due
to exothermic reactions at the base of the bed.

Adding buffer tanks is another strategy to avoid the fluctuations
in flow rate. Zhu et al. [297] proposed an 8-bed 13-step ET-PSA,
including a co-current steam rinse, a counter-current steam purge,
and four pressure equalization steps to produce H
2 -rich gas with
above 95% HP from the shifted gas ( Fig. 32 ). In this process, the
purge time was two times longer than the sum of feeding and rins-
ing times, which was beneficial to produce hydrogen with higher
purity. The R/F and P/F ratios were adjustable by changing the flow
rate of feeding, rinsing and purging gases or the ratio of adsorption
to rinse time. Note that in this process, both the flow rate of the
feed gas and product gas suffered fluctuations, which were caused

by the addition of a rinse step and the pressurizing stage at the
beginning of the feeding step (for the feed gas), and by the steam
consumption in the re-pressurization step and the different flow
rates of feed gas and rinse gas (for the product gas). After setting
buffer tanks with a size five times larger than that of the adsorp-

tion bed both before and after the ET-PSA systems, the discontinu-
ity of the flow rate was balanced with a pressure change within
±0.5 bar [297] .

It should be noted that the optimization objective of the ET-PSA
2  rather

processes  described  above  was  to  efficiently  capture  CO

to avoid the breakthrough of gas impurities during the feed step.
The short regeneration time would thus cause incomplete desorp-
2 would finally lead to trace CO/CO
tion, and the accumulated CO
2
leakage [118] . In addition, the desorption kinetics of K
3 /LDOs at
elevated temperatures were commonly slower than the adsorption
kinetics [89,113] . The marginal benefit obtained by increasing the
P/F ratio in a single ET-PSA was therefore small.

2 CO

Recently, Riboldi et al. [265] proposed a two-train NT-PSA to co-
2 , where
2 -rich gas for power generation and ultrapure H
produce H
the first-train NT-PSA loading AC removed CO
2 from the shifted gas
and the second-train NT-PSA purified the residual trace gas impuri-
ties. Inspired by this idea, a two-train ET-PSA was proposed, which
was  able  to  achieve  a  99.9994%  HP  and  97.51%  HRR  with  0.188
R/F ratio and 0.263 P/F ratio from the shifted gas [297] ( Fig. 34 ).
After the first-train ET-PSA, both the CO and CO
2  concentrations
were greatly reduced with an HP higher than 95%. It was therefore
possible to choose a process with a much longer adsorption time
of 240 0–480 0 s for the second-train ET-PSA. The longer cycle time
allowed fewer pressure-equalization steps, as the ratio of H
2 loss
2 produced in the feed/rinse step was
in blow down step to the H
lower. In addition, the R/F and P/F ratios to achieve high purity H
2
2 produced
were greatly reduced owing to the higher amount of H
in a single feed step and a longer and thorough purge step. An-
other benefit of using the two-train ET-PSA system was that the
tail gas of the second-train ET-PSA with a low CO/CO
2 concentra-
tion could be re-used as the purge gas for the first-train ET-PSA,
which was termed the “reflux structure”. The proposed structure
guaranteed that the final total steam consumption was comparable
to that of SEWGS but with a much higher HP and HRR. The conti-
nuity of the two-train ET-PSA relied on buffer beds for the product
gas and for the tail gas.

Fig. 35 shows a summary of different PSA technologies for car-
bon capture and hydrogen production. NT-PSA with layered pack-
ing beds could achieve above 99.99% HP but with an HRR com-
monly lower than 90% [181,275,277–286] . The main reasons for H
2
loss  were  its  adsorption  by  physical  adsorbents,  the  residual  H
2
2  consumption for
in the bulk bed after the feed step, and the H
the purge step. In the pre-combustion CO
2 process, a high HP was
not required for the power source of the gas turbine, and therefore
the HRR of NT-PSA could be improved by reducing the amount of
purge gas [262,263] . The adoption of ET-PSA in SEWGS further in-
creased the HRR to above 95% owing to the high CO
2 selectiv-
ity and the addition of steam rinsing and purging steps [39,290–
292,294–296] . The one-train ET-PSA was not adequate to produce
high purity H
2 directly from the shifted gas [9,136,297] , unless the
2 concentrations for the feed gas were reduced to less than
CO/CO
5% [299] . When adopting two-train ET-PSA with reflux structures,
both a high HP ( > 99.999%) and high HRR ( > 95%) were achieved
and steam consumption was comparable with that of SEWGS [297] .

4.4. CO/CO 2 purification energy consumption

It  is  generally  difficult  to  quantitatively  compare  the  energy
consumption of different types of gas purification technologies. The
energy sources for the conventional absorption-based technologies
2 -rich solvents us-
are mainly derived from the regeneration of CO
ing flashing, stripping, heating, etc. When thermal regeneration is
applied, the purification energy consumption can be evaluated by
the ratio of the heating load of the reboiler (MJ t ) to the mass flow
rate of captured CO
2 (kg) [300,301] . However, this definition does
not reflect information such as the purification efficiency and the
temperature range of the required heating loadings [301] . NT-PSAs
achieve the adsorption and desorption of gas impurities through
pressure swing, and therefore the thermal swing can be avoided.
Alternatively, the low HRR due to the adoption of low tempera-
2  loss in the blow down step reduces
ture H

bed 7-step ET-PSA for high purity H 2 production from an H 2 -rich gas containing 1%
CO, 1% CO 2 , 10% H 2 O, and 88% H 2 . Each of the beds was packed with a mixture of
K 2 CO 3 /MG30 adsorbents and Fe 2 O 3 /Cr 2 O 3 WGS catalysts with a volume ratio of 5.

than to produce high purity hydrogen. To achieve a 90–95% capture
2  purity, the HP according to Eq. (31) was
ratio and a 95–99% CO
usually  below  99%.  On  the  other  hand,  previous  studies  have
proven the feasibility of using a composite column to purify trace
CO/CO
2 [197,198,238] . To verify the high purity hydrogen produc-
tion process of ET-PSA, a 2-bed 7-step process including co-current
steam rinsing and counter-current steam purging was proposed for
dealing with a hydrogen-rich gas [299] ( Fig. 33 (a)). By reducing the
carbon ratio in the feed gas, both the adsorption and desorption
times were extended to 50 0–70 0 s. The long adsorption time al-
lowed relatively low R/F and P/F ratios, and the long desorption
time guaranteed a complete regeneration for the next adsorption
step. Fig. 33 (b) exhibits the relationship of HP and HRR with the
R/F ratio and P/F ratio. The steam rinse mainly affected the HRR
and the steam purge mainly affected the HP. The model could sta-
bly achieve above 99% HRR and 99.999% HP with less than a total
steam-to-feed ratio of 0.25. In an optimized case, the steam rinse

pushed 2/3 of the residual H
the other bed. The released CO
2  in the rinse step did not pene-
trate the bed due to re-adsorption near the exit of the bed, which
led to a high HP. The self-purification ability of the ET-PSA system
was also verified. While the adsorption bed was accidentally pen-
etrated, the HP of the ET-PSA could recover its initial value within
80 cycles. A periodic thermal regeneration by increasing the oper-
ating temperature to 450 °C could greatly accelerate the recovery
rate.

4.3.2. Two-train ET-PSA

The current research direction concerning ET-PSA for H

2 purifi-
cation is to achieve both a high HP ( > 99.999%) and a high HRR
( > 95%) with the lowest purification energy consumption (R/F ratio
and P/F ratio). In the 8-bed 13-step ET-PSA, the addition of a rinse
step increased the HRR from 82.11% to 97.92% to achieve above a
95% HP, and by increasing the P/F ratio to 0.3, there was a signif-
icant increase of HP from 94.952% to 97.715% [297] . However, one
shortcoming  of  ET-PSA  was  that  the  further  improvement of  HP
was limited by the short adsorption/desorption time. To reach an
HP above 99% in a single ET-PSA, the steam consumption for the
purge step was unacceptable. In fact, when feeding with shifted
2 , a short cycle time was required

duction of the purification unit on the performance of the entire
system. In the DOE DE-FE0 0 0 0469 project, the TDA compared the
thermodynamic performance of IGCC systems with different CCS
technologies [18] . It was reported that the ET-PSA based on meso-
porous carbon achieved a net electric efficiency of 34% in an IGCC
power plant ( Fig. 36 ). This value with a carbon capture ratio of 90%
was much higher than that of the Selexol process (31.6%). Techno-
economic analysis indicated that the cost-of-electricity with trans-
port,  storage,  and  monitoring  was  132.6  $/MWh  for  ET-PSA  and
148.6 $/MWh for Selexol [302] . Recently, a CFD model with vali-
dating data from the Wabash River IGCC was built, with the aim
of further reducing the cost of this ET-PSA [303] . When combining
several advanced technologies such as the ion transport membrane
for air separation, the TDA’s ET-PSA for warm gas carbon capture
and the H class gas turbine, the advanced IGCC achieved efficien-
cies of 36.7–38.3% [304,305] .

Applications  of  ET-PSA  with  other  adsorbents  have  also  been
reported.  Ito  et  al.  [306]  applied  an  ET-PSA  unit  based  on  zeo-
lites operating at 150 °C for pre-combustion carbon capture in an
IGCC power plant, and reported a higher plant efficiency than for
chemical CO
2  absorption technologies. Similar results were found
by Liu et al. [9] for their 8-bed 11-step ET-PSA with MgO-based
adsorbents,  although  they  also  suggested  that  the  hydrogen  loss
during  the  desulfurization  process  reduced  the  advantage  of  ET-
PSA. Chi et al. [307] revealed that the net efficiency of a IGCC sys-
tem undergoes a 2.8% improvement when replacing MDEA-based
decarbonation  with  ET-PSA  with  Na
3 -promoted  MgO.  Coul-
ing  et  al.  [308]  compared  different  IGCC–CCS  systems  and  con-
firmed that the efficiency of IGCC with a hypothetical ET-PSA pro-
cess was higher (33.2 ± 3.8%) than that with Selexol (32.6 ± 3.8%),
Pd-alloy  membrane  (32.9 ± 3.3%),  and  CO
2  membrane  processes
(32.3 ± 3.3%). Later, these authors identified four metal hydroxides
with an enthalpy of 15–20 kg/mol as adsorbent candidates for ET-
PSA, which could have overall IGCC–CCS efficiencies higher than or
equal to those of Selexol [309] .

the power output in power plants, thus indirectly generating en-
ergy consumption [297] . As mentioned before, ET-PSAs replace the
H
2  purge  step  in  NT-PSAs  with  steam  rinsing  and  steam  purg-
ing, where the high pressure rinse steam squeezes the residual H
2
out of the column after the adsorption step, and the low pressure
purge steam promotes CO
2 desorption on the surface of adsorbents
and pushes the gas impurities into the tail gas column after the
blow down step [118] . The rinse and purge steam, which comes
from the HRSG system, therefore becomes the main energy con-
sumption in ET-PSAs.

The  above  analysis  indicates  that  the  energy  consumption  of
the purification units closely correlates with the environment, and
simply  using  the  power  loading  or  thermal  loading  is  not  accu-
rate. A more accurate way is to evaluate the effect of the intro-

when the carbon capture ratio was fixed at 90%, the HRR of ET-
PSA should be at least 93.5% to reach the efficiency of the Selexol
process. In a later study, the energy consumption of a 4-bed 8-step
ET-PSA developed by Zheng et al. [136] was evaluated under the
same framework [312] . When the purification unit is applied in a
power plant, the energy consumption can be evaluated by specific
primary energy consumption for carbon avoided (SPECCA) [313] as
shown in Eq. (34) :
SPECCA = ( HR − H R REF ) / ( E REF − E )

Despite the benefits of warm gas cleanup, the proposed ET-PSA
2 purge step was less energy efficient than that
system with an H
of the Selexol process. A slight improvement was noted when in-
creasing the bed number from 4 to 5. However, when steam rins-
ing and steam purging were introduced into the original sequence,
the SPECCA of ET-PSA was reduced to 2.32–2.52 MJ/kg, which was
20.3–26.6% lower than that of the Selexol process. The total steam
consumption for the rinse and purge steps can be adjusted to meet
different requirements of HP and HRR in energy and chemical in-
dustrial processes, among which the HP is more sensitive to the
steam purge and the HRR is more sensitive to the steam rinse.

In  the  CAESAR  project,  Gazzani’s  group  evaluated  the  en-
ergy  consumption  of  SEWGS  for  pre-combustion  CO
2  capture  in

5. Technological challenges, perspectives and research
directions

To achieve the goal of bring the ET-PSA into TRL 6, there still
exist  several  technological  challenges  on  the  adsorbent,  column,
and system scales.

During  the  discussion  on  the  CO

K
3 /LDO, most studies assumed that unsaturated oxygens rep-
resented  the  adsorption  sites  of  LDO.  However,  there  is  still  no
direct evidence proving the existence of unsaturated oxygen. This
impedes a deeper understanding of the enhancement mechanism
of K +  ions on the CO
2  adsorption performance. However, it may
be possible to observe the unsaturated oxygen through more ad-
vanced technologies, such as in-situ Electron Spin Resonance (ESR)
or in-situ Raman. Experiments on the direct observation of the ap-
pearance and disappearance of O − using ESR would be helpful to

2 CO

3 /LDOs have been proven to exhibit a good performance
for elevated-temperature CO
2 adsorption. However, even after var-
ious  modifications,  their  adsorption  capacities  are  still  relatively
low. Novel adsorbents with much higher capacities need to be de-
signed. The current literature reports the synthesis and characteri-
zation of molten salts-promoted MgO, which has a near 20 mmol/g
capacity at 300 °C [321,322] . This could represent a possible solu-
tion to develop better adsorbents.

1 Design and optimization of multi-train ET-PSA

Although using a two-train ET-PSA could achieve both high HP
( > 99.999%) and high HRR ( > 95%), there is scope for further opti-
mizing the purification process. For instance, ET-PSAs with simpler
configurations are needed to reduce or even avoid the utilization of
buffer tanks. The adoption of multi-train ET-PSAs or advanced pro-
cess sequencing might improve HRR and reduce the total steam
consumption.  In  addition,  most  published  ET-PSAs  use  only  one
2  adsorbent. However, by using adsorbents with large
kind of CO

adsorption capacities in the first train with a low thermodynami-
cally balanced CO
2 pressure in the last train, a better purification
performance could be achieved.

1 Purification energy consumption in other applications

Most of previous studies regarding the energy consumption of
ET-PSA were based on IGCC–CCS systems. However, the configura-
tion of purification systems might be different in high purity hy-
drogen production plants. More studies are needed to clarify the
relationship between purification efficiency, total steam usage, and
the  purification  energy  consumption  of  ET-PSA  in  other  applica-
tions  such  as  integrated  gasification  fuel  cell  power  plants  and
coal-to-ammonia plants.

1 Pufirication of other gas and solid impurities at warm gas con-

ditions

Besides CO and CO

2 , there are other gas and solid impurities
existed in the syngas/reformed gas. Although several works have
tried to apply elevated temperature adsorbents in removing H
2 S
[323–325] , COS [326] , HCl [327] , and heavy metal elements [328] ,
more fundamental research is needed to finally bring the warm gas
cleanup technology into industrialization.

6. Conclusions

In this review, recent advances on the development of elevated-
temperature  CO/CO
2  purification  technologies  for  hydrogen-rich
gas were summarized. By using ET-PSA combining the WGS reac-
tion and elevated-temperature CO
2 capture, the advanced purifica-
tion process avoids sensible heat loss and reheat energy consump-
tion. The trade-off problem between purity and recovery ratio in

NT-PSA was solved by the introduction of steam rinsing and steam
purging. The latest breakthroughs regarding several bottlenecks of
ET-PSA technologies were discussed, and are listed as follows.

1. Calibrating, testing, and correcting methods for high pressure
adsorption kinetics have been developed to avoid the dis-
placement effect in conventional methods. A high pressure
non-equilibrium dynamic model has been proposed to de-
scribe the adsorption performance of K
3 /LDOs at 300–
400 °C and 1–20 bar.

2. CO

2 adsorption mechanisms of K

3 /LDOs either in the ab-
sence or in the presence of H
2 O have been clarified, which
are able to explain their changeable adsorption capacities in
different  operating  conditions  and  the  excellent  trace  CO
2
purification  performance.  New  adsorbents  with  higher  ad-
sorption  site  densities  and  better  K +  ion  dispersion  have
been synthesized using the organic solvent washing method.
3. The influence of adsorption temperature, pressure, inlet com-
ponent, and flow rate on the CO/CO
2 purification capacity in
composite  single  columns  with  coupling  high  temperature
WGS catalyst and K
3 /MG30 adsorbent have been stud-
ied. Column models have been established by comprehen-
sively considering adsorbent/catalyst kinetics, the mass and
momentum balance of the adsorption column and dynamic
boundary conditions, and the strategy of adjusting the oper-
ating conditions has been clarified.

4. ET-PSAs have been set up for the CO/CO

2  purification from
hydrogen-rich gas, and both high HP ( > 99.999%) and high
HRR ( > 95%) in product gas have been achieved by adding
steam rinsing and steam purging steps. When the shifted gas
was used as the feed gas, the necessity of adopting multi-
train ET-PSA with tail gas reflux structures was proven.
5. The quantitative comparison standard between ET-PSA and
conventional purification methods has been established. The
purification unit has been coupled into power plants, where
the purification energy consumption of CO/CO
2  was calcu-
lated using the reduction of power generation efficiency and
the total purification amount. When applied in IGCC, the pu-
rification energy consumption of the ET-PSA system was ap-

In  many  ways  ET-PSA  should  be  attractive  to  researchers,
students,  academics,  industry  professionals  and  related  manu-
facturers,  as  well  as  the  hydrogen  energy  industry,  but  further
adsorbent-, column-, and system-scale studies are needed for this
technology to ultimately become industrialized.
