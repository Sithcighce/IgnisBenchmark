    "question_text": "How does the Biot number classification distinguish between thermally thin and thermally thick particles in biomass combustion, and what are the implications for intra-particle temperature gradients and conversion stages?",
    "standard_answer": "The Biot number (Bi = h_eff * d / λ) distinguishes thermally thin (Bi < 0.1) from thermally thick (Bi > 0.1) particles based on the ratio of internal to external heat transfer resistance. For thermally thick particles, significant intra-particle temperature gradients exist due to limited internal conduction relative to surface convection/radiation, leading to simultaneous drying, devolatilization, and char conversion stages occurring at different radial positions. In contrast, thermally thin particles exhibit uniform temperature, resulting in sequential conversion stages. This gradient in thermally thick particles necessitates modeling intra-particle transport phenomena, as varying temperatures affect reaction rates, product yields, and overall conversion times. The characteristic length (d) and thermal conductivity (λ) are critical, with larger particles or lower conductivity exacerbating gradients, impacting heat and mass transfer during combustion.",

    "question_text": "Why does anisotropic thermal conductivity in wood logs significantly affect heat transfer during combustion compared to isotropic pellets, and how does this influence devolatilization rates?",
    "standard_answer": "Wood logs exhibit anisotropic thermal conductivity due to their cellular structure, with higher conductivity along the grain (longitudinal direction) than across it (radial/tangential directions), whereas pellets are often modeled as isotropic. This anisotropy causes non-uniform heat penetration in logs, leading to faster heating along the grain and slower transverse heating. Consequently, devolatilization initiates earlier in regions aligned with the grain, creating asymmetric reaction fronts and varying volatile release rates. In contrast, isotropic pellets heat uniformly, promoting symmetric conversion. The anisotropic effect complicates modeling by requiring direction-dependent properties, impacting temperature distributions, and potentially leading to localized hotspots or incomplete conversion in transverse directions, which can affect pollutant formation and combustion efficiency.",
    "original_text": {
      "1": "Wood logs are considered anisotropic. Therefore, e.g. the thermal conductivity of wood is smaller in the radial and the tangential direction to the grains compared to the longitudinal direction.",

    "standard_answer": "The effective diffusion coefficient is calculated as D_eff = (ε * s_c * D) / τ, where ε is porosity (0.6), s_c is constriction factor (1.2), D is binary diffusion coefficient (1e-5 m²/s), and τ is tortuosity (2.5). Substituting values: D_eff = (0.6 * 1.2 * 1e-5) / 2.5 = (7.2e-6) / 2.5 = 2.88e-6 m²/s. This value is approximately 29% of the binary diffusion coefficient, indicating significantly reduced species transport due to the porous wood structure. The reduction arises from longer diffusion paths (tortuosity) and pore constrictions, slowing down mass transfer of volatiles and gases. In combustion modeling, this lower D_eff emphasizes the importance of convective transport via Darcy's law and can lead to higher intra-particle concentrations, affecting reaction rates and product yields.",
    "original_text": {
      "1": "It is suggested by Fogler that it can be related to the binary diffusion coefficient, D, such that D_eff = (ε_g s_c D) / τ, where τ is tortuosity, s_c is a constriction factor and ε_g is the volume fraction occupied by the gas phase, which is equal to the porosity in the case of dry wood.",

    "question_text": "How does the assumption of local thermal equilibrium simplify the energy equation in wood combustion models, and under what conditions is this assumption valid based on Peclet number analysis?",
    "standard_answer": "The local thermal equilibrium assumption simplifies the energy equation by considering a single temperature for all phases (solid, liquid, gas), reducing computational cost by avoiding separate energy equations. This is valid when heat transfer between phases is rapid compared to internal gradients, typically justified by high Peclet numbers (Pe = d * u * ρ * c_p / λ), where convective transport dominates over conductive transport. For wood combustion, large Peclet numbers indicate that gas flow through pores efficiently couples phase temperatures, supporting equilibrium. However, deviations occur if phases have significantly different thermal capacities or if flow rates are low, leading to errors such as overestimated conversion times. The assumption is more accurate for smaller particles or higher flow velocities, but in large logs with slow heating, separate phase temperatures may be needed for precision.",

    "question_text": "What mechanisms explain the formation of intra-particle pressure peaks during wood devolatilization, and how do these pressures influence mass transfer and product distribution?",
    "standard_answer": "Intra-particle pressure peaks during devolatilization arise from rapid volatile production within the porous wood structure, where gas generation rates exceed outflow capacities. Key mechanisms include: (1) Thermal degradation of biopolymers (cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin) releasing gases and tars, increasing local gas density. (2) Restricted permeability due to pore structure and possible tar condensation, reducing gas escape. (3) Temperature-dependent reaction kinetics accelerating gas production in heated regions. These pressure gradients drive convective mass transfer, affecting product distribution by altering residence times—higher pressures can force volatiles inward, leading to secondary reactions like tar cracking or condensation, which modify yields of char, gases, and tars. Conversely, lower pressures favor outward flow, reducing secondary reactions. Modeling this requires coupling Darcy's law for flow with reaction kinetics to capture transport-reaction interactions.",

      "1": "It has been experimentally shown that significant pressure peaks can form inside a wood log.",
