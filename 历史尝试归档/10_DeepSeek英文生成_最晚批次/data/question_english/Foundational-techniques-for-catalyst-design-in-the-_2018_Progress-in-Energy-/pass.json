    "question_text": "In the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of phenolics over Pd/MₓOᵧ catalysts, how does support oxophilicity affect the keto-enol tautomerization mechanism and selectivity to aromatics?",
    "standard_answer": "Support oxophilicity in Pd/MₓOᵧ catalysts enhances HDO selectivity to aromatics by shifting the keto-enol equilibrium toward the keto-tautomer intermediate, facilitating C–O bond cleavage. Phenolics like phenol undergo surface-mediated tautomerization to cyclohexadienone, where the carbonyl group interacts with oxophilic supports. DRIFTS shows redshifted ν(C=O) modes from ~1715 cm⁻¹ to 1666–1687 cm⁻¹, with larger shifts on more oxophilic supports (e.g., Pd/TiO₂ at 1666 cm⁻¹) correlating with higher deoxygenation activity. This redshift indicates weakened C=O bonds due to strong Lewis acid-oxygen interactions, stabilizing the keto-intermediate. Hydrogenation by Pd nanoparticles then forms cyclohexanol, which dehydrates to aromatics. The oxophilicity, quantified via cyclohexanone adsorption, shows that supports with greater carbonyl vibrational shifts (>1695 cm⁻¹ to <1660 cm⁻¹) promote tautomerization by lowering the energy barrier for enol-to-keto conversion. Thus, support oxophilicity descriptors guide catalyst design by enhancing intermediate stability and directing reaction flux toward deoxygenation over hydrogenation pathways.",

    "question_text": "How does the adsorption geometry of furfural on metal surfaces influence selectivity in biomass upgrading reactions, and what role do surface composition and coverage play in controlling reaction pathways?",
    "standard_answer": "The adsorption geometry of furfural on metal surfaces critically determines selectivity in biomass upgrading by controlling which functional groups interact with active sites. On non-oxophilic metals like Ni(111) and Pt(111), furfural adsorbs in a flat orientation with the furan ring parallel to the surface, enabling strong ring-surface interactions that favor decarbonylation to furan. In contrast, when oxophilic metals such as Fe are added to Ni(111) surfaces, furfural adopts a tilted adsorption configuration where the furan ring is no longer bound to the surface. This tilted geometry suppresses ring chemistry pathways like decarbonylation and ring hydrogenation by preventing ring-surface interactions, instead promoting alternative reaction pathways. Surface coverage also influences adsorption geometry - high hydrogen coverage on Pt surfaces forces furfural into tilted configurations by reducing available surface sites, shifting selectivity from decarbonylation to hydrogenation. These geometric effects demonstrate how manipulating surface composition and coverage can direct reaction pathways by selectively exposing different functional groups to catalytic sites.",
    "original_text": {
      "1": "HREEL spectra reveal that FAL adsorbs in a flat orientation on surfaces which are selective for decarbonylation to furan, e.g., Ni(111) and Pt(111); the same is true of oxygenated aromatics such as benzaldehyde.",
      "2": "The addition of an oxophilic metal, i.e., Fe, to a Ni(111) surface causes FAL to adsorb in a tilted configuration with the furan ring no longer bound to the surface, rendering ring chemistry, i.e., decarbonylation or ring hydrogenation, less likely."

    "standard_answer": "The deprotonation enthalpy (DPE) of surface hydroxyl groups in Me₁-Me₂Oₓ catalysts directly correlates with ring-opening hydrogenolysis activity, where lower DPE values enhance Brønsted acidity and facilitate the protonation of ether oxygen atoms. Computational studies using DFT calculations on model clusters reveal that the DPE of hydroxyl groups on Rh-ReOₓ clusters is approximately 1140 kJ/mol, which is lower than most zeolites (DPE ~1150–1200 kJ/mol) and comparable to highly acidic heteropolyacids. This lower DPE is attributed to the high oxophilicity of the Me₂ component (e.g., Re), which weakens O–H bonds and increases surface acidity. The experimental rate of ring-opening to products like 1,5-pentanediol is correlated with the average surface DPE, indicating that the protonation step is kinetically relevant. For instance, catalysts with lower DPE (e.g., Rh-ReOₓ) exhibit higher activity compared to those with higher DPE (e.g., Rh-MoOₓ), supporting the role of DPE as a thermodynamic descriptor in the protonation-hydrogenation mechanism where the noble metal (Me₁) provides hydrogenation sites.",

    "standard_answer": "In situ generated Brønsted acid sites (BAS) in NaY zeolite decrease methyl lactate dehydration selectivity by catalyzing side reactions such as decarbonylation to acetaldehyde and decomposition to coke. These BAS are formed through an ion exchange process between methyl lactate and Na⁺-form zeolites, generating sodium-carboxylate salts and BAS. Transmission FTIR spectroscopy identifies the in situ generated BAS through the characteristic ν(Al-O⁺H–) band in the range of ~3645–3635 cm⁻¹ and the sodium-carboxylate salt via the ν([O–C–O]⁻) stretching mode at ~1605–1570 cm⁻¹. The role of BAS in reducing dehydration selectivity is confirmed by quenching experiments: adding an alkaline species like pyridine to the methyl lactate feed titrates the BAS, evidenced by pyridinium formation, and increases dehydration selectivity by more than 20% by suppressing the side reactions catalyzed by BAS. This spectroscopic evidence directly links BAS generation to decreased selectivity, highlighting the importance of controlling BAS formation to optimize catalyst performance in biomass upgrading processes.",

    "standard_answer": "The high oxophilicity of Mo₂C surfaces, characterized by elevated oxygen binding energy (OBE), promotes selective C–O bond cleavage over C–C scission in oxygenated biomass molecules through specific molecular mechanisms. HREEL spectra of adsorbed ethylene glycol (EG) at 100 K on both Mo₂C and 1 monolayer (ML) Ni-covered Mo₂C surfaces show the absence of ν(OH) (3085 cm⁻¹) and τ(OH) (744 cm⁻¹) bands, indicating the formation of an ethylenedioxy species (–O–CH₂–CH₂–O–) in both cases. This suggests strong surface-oxygen interactions that stabilize oxygen-containing intermediates. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations of atomic binding energies reveal that Mo₂C has a similar carbon binding energy (CBE = 736 kJ/mol) to common reforming catalysts like Pt (690 kJ/mol), but a much higher OBE (674 kJ/mol vs. less than 400 kJ/mol), indicating that oxophilicity is a key descriptor for deoxygenation activity. The strong oxygen binding facilitates preferential adsorption through oxygen atoms, lowering activation barriers for C–O bond rupture while preserving C–C bonds, as evidenced by the persistence of C–C vibrational modes in HREELS studies.",
