    "question_text": "Why does the ideal selectivity of gas pairs like H₂/CO₂ increase with temperature, while selectivity for pairs like O₂/N₂ or CO₂/CH4 decreases? Explain the competing effects of diffusivity and solubility selectivity.",
    "standard_answer": "The temperature dependence of ideal selectivity (α_A/B = P_A/P_B) arises from the relative changes in diffusivity and solubility selectivities. Diffusivity selectivity (D_A/D_B) generally decreases with temperature because the activation energy for diffusion (E_D) is higher for larger molecules; thus, heating disproportionately increases the diffusivity of larger penetrants, reducing the diffusivity advantage of smaller gases. Solubility selectivity (S_A/S_B) depends on the condensability difference: for pairs where the larger gas is more condensable (e.g., CO₂ over H₂), heating reduces the solubility of the condensable gas more sharply (ΔH_s < 0), increasing solubility selectivity. For H₂/CO₂, H₂ is smaller and less condensable, so diffusivity selectivity decreases slightly, but solubility selectivity increases significantly because CO₂ solubility drops with temperature. This net increase in solubility selectivity outweighs the diffusivity loss, raising overall H₂/CO₂ selectivity. Conversely, for O₂/N₂ or CO₂/CH4, both gases have similar condensability, and the smaller gas (O₂ or CO₂) is also more condensable, so both diffusivity and solubility selectivities decrease with temperature, leading to reduced overall selectivity.",
    "original_text": {
      "1": "In the case of H2/CO2 separation, however, a significant decrease in the solubility of more condensable gas with temperature causes a substantial increase in solubility selectivity that consequently offsets the decreasing diffusivity selectivity.",
      "2": "When one component is smaller, and at the same time, more soluble than the other one (e.g., O2 over N2 or CO2 over CH4), both solubility and diffusivity selectivities decrease as temperature increases."

    "question_text": "Calculate the permeability of CO₂ through a polyimide membrane at 150°C if its permeability at 25°C is 10 Barrer, given an activation energy for diffusion of 40 kJ/mol and an enthalpy of sorption of -15 kJ/mol. Assume the pre-exponential factors remain constant.",
    "standard_answer": "To calculate the permeability at 150°C, use the combined solution-diffusion model where permeability P = S × D. First, convert temperatures to Kelvin: T₁ = 25°C = 298 K, T₂ = 150°C = 423 K. The diffusivity D follows Arrhenius: D₂/D₁ = exp[-(E_D/R)(1/T₂ - 1/T₁)], with E_D = 40,000 J/mol, R = 8.314 J/mol·K. Thus, D₂/D₁ = exp[-(40000/8.314)(1/423 - 1/298)] = exp[-(4810.5)(0.002364 - 0.003356)] = exp[-(4810.5)(-0.000992)] = exp[4.773] ≈ 118.3. Solubility S follows van't Hoff: S₂/S₁ = exp[-(ΔH_s/R)(1/T₂ - 1/T₁)], with ΔH_s = -15,000 J/mol. So, S₂/S₁ = exp[-( -15000/8.314)(1/423 - 1/298)] = exp[(1804.5)(-0.000992)] = exp[-1.790] ≈ 0.167. Then, permeability P₂ = P₁ × (S₂/S₁) × (D₂/D₁) = 10 Barrer × 0.167 × 118.3 ≈ 197.6 Barrer. This calculation shows that despite the decrease in CO₂ solubility at higher temperature, the large increase in diffusivity dominates, resulting in a net increase in permeability.",

    "question_text": "How does temperature affect the diffusivity and solubility of gases in polymeric membranes according to the solution-diffusion model, and what are the underlying physical mechanisms for these temperature dependencies?",
    "standard_answer": "In the solution-diffusion model, gas transport through dense polymeric membranes involves three steps: sorption at the upstream, diffusion through the membrane, and desorption at the downstream. Temperature impacts both diffusivity and solubility through distinct mechanisms. Diffusivity (D) follows an Arrhenius relationship: D = D₀ exp(-E_D/RT), where E_D is the activation energy for diffusion, R is the gas constant, and T is absolute temperature. Increasing temperature exponentially increases diffusivity because higher thermal energy enhances molecular motion and chain segment mobility, reducing the energy barrier for penetrant jumping between polymer free volumes. For solubility (S), the van't Hoff equation applies: S = S₀ exp(-ΔH_s/RT), where ΔH_s is the partial molar enthalpy of sorption. For less condensable gases (e.g., H₂, O₂), ΔH_s > 0, so solubility increases with temperature due to endothermic mixing. For condensable gases (e.g., CO₂), ΔH_s < 0, leading to decreased solubility with temperature as exothermic sorption is disfavored. The combined effect on permeability (P = S × D) means smaller, less condensable gases see increased permeability with temperature, while larger, condensable gases may experience reduced permeability due to solubility decline outweighing diffusivity gains.",

    "question_text": "How do the molecular structure and bond energy characteristics of thermally stable polymers influence their resistance to thermal degradation, and what role does resonance stabilization play in enhancing thermal stability according to the principles outlined in the paper?",
    "standard_answer": "Thermally stable polymers derive their resistance to thermal degradation primarily from the strength of primary chemical bonds in the polymer chain, which sets an upper limit on vibrational energy before bond rupture occurs. The paper states: 'The principal source of thermal stability is the primary bond energy that exists between the atoms in the polymer chain. The strength of a chemical bond imposes an upper limit on the vibrational energy that a molecule may possess without bond rupture.' Additionally, resonance stabilization provides significant enhancement to thermal stability. As the paper explains: 'High thermal stability in polymers can also be achieved by making full use of resonance stabilization. Resonance stabilization of aromatic structures, such as benzene or quinoxaline, provides an additional amount of thermal stability and bond strength.' This resonance energy in aromatic cyclic structures contributes substantially to the overall thermal stability by distributing energy across the molecular structure and resisting localized bond scission. The combination of strong primary bonds and resonance stabilization creates polymers that can withstand elevated temperatures without significant degradation, making them suitable for high-temperature gas separation applications where conventional polymers would fail.",

    "standard_answer": "Thermoplastic and thermoset polymers exhibit fundamentally different thermal behaviors due to their distinct molecular architectures. Thermoplastic polymers undergo reversible physical changes when heated - they soften or melt and return to a solid state when cooled, with the chemical nature remaining unchanged during this process. This reversible behavior stems from weak intermolecular forces between polymer chains that allow chain mobility upon heating. In contrast, thermosetting polymers do not soften but instead undergo irreversible decomposition at high temperatures, characterized by charring and breakdown. This irreversible behavior results from strong chemical crosslinks between molecules that prevent chain mobility. The maximum service temperature for thermoplastics is primarily limited by their softening point, which occurs above their glass transition temperature (T_g) where polymer chains gain sufficient mobility for deformation. For thermosets, the service temperature is determined by the onset of decomposition since they maintain structural integrity until chemical bond breakdown occurs. These differences are critical for gas separation membrane applications where maintaining structural integrity at elevated temperatures is essential for long-term performance and reliability, particularly in processes like CO2/syngas separation in coal gasification where operating temperatures can exceed 200°C.",
