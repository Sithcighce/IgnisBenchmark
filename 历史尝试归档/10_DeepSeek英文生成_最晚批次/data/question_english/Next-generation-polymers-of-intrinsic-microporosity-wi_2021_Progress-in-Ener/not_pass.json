    "standard_answer": "Thermal treatment is a post-modification strategy that can mitigate physical aging in PIM membranes by applying controlled thermal energy to modify polymer chain mobility and rearrangement kinetics. From a heat transfer perspective, the temperature profile and heating rate during thermal treatment influence the polymer's free volume distribution and chain packing efficiency. In fluid mechanics terms, the stabilized microstructure resulting from thermal treatment maintains more consistent pore size distribution and free volume elements, which directly impacts gas transport properties by preserving both permeability pathways and molecular sieving capabilities. The treatment enhances mechanical stability by balancing inter- and intra-chain rigidities, though the specific mechanisms of how thermal treatment achieves this balance require detailed analysis of the thermal energy transfer and polymer response dynamics. The paper's thermal treatment section provides specific insights into how controlled heating protocols can optimize membrane performance while minimizing aging effects.",
