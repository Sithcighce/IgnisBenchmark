    "question_text": "How does flame-flame interaction in closely spaced annular combustors influence flame dynamics, and what experimental evidence supports this interaction?",
    "standard_answer": "Flame-flame interaction in closely spaced annular combustors influences flame dynamics by altering the spatial distribution and merging of adjacent flames. When nozzle spacing is small relative to flame dimensions, adjacent flames merge in the inter-nozzle regions, creating a continuous reaction zone rather than discrete flames. This merging is clearly demonstrated in experimental studies using time-average OH* chemiluminescence imaging from overhead views. The extent of flame interaction depends on nozzle spacing, with distinct flame shapes maintained at larger spacings but significant merging occurring at smaller spacings. This level of interaction can distinctly influence the flame dynamics, as discussed in the literature. The experimental evidence shows that at the largest spacing, flames retain distinct shapes, while at the smallest spacing, they are significantly merged in the regions between the nozzles, indicating that flame-flame interaction becomes more pronounced as nozzle spacing decreases.",
    "original_text": {
      "1": "Flame-flame interaction is important in closely spaced flames, and is illustrated in Fig. 11, which compares two nozzle configurations with different nozzle spacings. At the largest spacing, the flames retain distinct shapes, but at the smallest spacing, they are significantly merged in the regions between the nozzles.",
      "2": "This level of interaction can distinctly influence the flame dynamics, as will be discussed in Sec. 5."
