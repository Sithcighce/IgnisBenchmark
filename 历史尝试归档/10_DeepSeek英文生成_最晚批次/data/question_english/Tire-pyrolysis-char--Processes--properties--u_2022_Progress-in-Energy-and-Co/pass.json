    "question_text": "Calculate the approximate energy required to pyrolyze 1 kg of waste tire rubber from 25°C to 500°C, assuming an average specific heat capacity of 1.5 kJ/kg·K for the rubber and a heat of pyrolysis of 500 kJ/kg. How does this energy compare to the higher heating value (HHV) of tire char (∼23 MJ/kg)?",
    "standard_answer": "To calculate the energy required for pyrolysis, we consider the sensible heat to raise the temperature and the heat of pyrolysis for decomposition. Sensible heat Q_sensible = m * c_p * ΔT = 1 kg * 1.5 kJ/kg·K * (500 - 25) K = 712.5 kJ. Heat of pyrolysis Q_pyrolysis = m * ΔH_pyrolysis = 1 kg * 500 kJ/kg = 500 kJ. Total energy Q_total = Q_sensible + Q_pyrolysis = 712.5 + 500 = 1212.5 kJ or 1.2125 MJ. The HHV of tire char is about 23 MJ/kg, which is significantly higher than the energy input (1.2125 MJ), indicating that the pyrolysis process is energy-efficient, as the char's energy content is nearly 19 times the required input. This favorable energy balance highlights the potential of tire pyrolysis for net energy recovery, though practical systems must account for heat losses and reactor efficiency.",

    "question_text": "In waste tire pyrolysis, how do secondary cracking reactions at high temperatures (600-900°C) affect the yield and composition of tire char, and what mechanisms drive the reduction in char yield with increasing temperature?",
    "standard_answer": "Secondary cracking reactions at high temperatures (600-900°C) in waste tire pyrolysis reduce tire char yield and alter its composition by promoting further decomposition of primary pyrolysis products. As temperature increases, volatile matter from initial rubber degradation undergoes cracking into lighter gases (e.g., methane, hydrogen) and aromatics, which escape the solid matrix, decreasing char mass. Mechanisms include radical-initiated scission of long-chain hydrocarbons and dehydrogenation reactions, which convert fixed carbon into gaseous products. For instance, at 700-900°C, char yield drops from 59.4 to 46.8 wt.% due to enhanced cracking rates, governed by Arrhenius kinetics where higher temperatures exponentially increase reaction rates. Additionally, secondary reactions can lead to carbon deposition from volatiles, but net char reduction dominates due to gasification and volatilization of carbonaceous material. This temperature-dependent behavior underscores the trade-off between char yield and quality, as higher temperatures may improve char porosity but at the cost of lower mass recovery.",

      "1": "The second stage involves secondary cracking of the produced pyrolysis products that mainly takes place in the temperature range of 660-850 °C, which has also been reported in the works of Han et al. [78] and Li et al. [76].",

    "standard_answer": "The thermal decomposition kinetics of NR and SBR in waste tires differ significantly due to their distinct polymer structures and bond characteristics. According to thermo-gravimetric analysis studies, NR and SBR/BR degrade between 250 and 500°C during tire pyrolysis. The activation energy values reveal important differences: SBR has a lower activation energy of 212 kJ·mol⁻¹, while NR requires higher energy for decomposition with an activation energy of 265 kJ·mol⁻¹. This difference can be explained by considering the molecular structures - NR (polyisoprene) contains predominantly C-C and C=C bonds that require substantial energy for cleavage, whereas SBR's complex structure with aromatic styrene units and butadiene segments may undergo different decomposition pathways. The thermal degradation behavior varies between different tire components, with waste tires typically showing multiple decomposition stages corresponding to the different rubber types present. These kinetic differences are crucial for optimizing pyrolysis conditions, as the varying activation energies affect the energy requirements and temperature profiles needed for efficient decomposition of the different rubber components in waste tires.",

    "question_text": "How do dispersion coefficients and gas flow velocities in different pyrolysis reactors (e.g., fixed bed vs. fluidized bed) correlate with the observed char yields and secondary reaction extents during tire pyrolysis, and what are the implications for tire char properties based on the reactor operating conditions?",
    "standard_answer": "The dispersion coefficient (D) and gas flow velocity (υ) are key parameters that characterize reactor hydrodynamics and mixing behavior, which correlate with observed pyrolysis outcomes. According to the literature, fixed bed reactors typically operate with D = 0.0-0.02 m²·s⁻¹ and υ = 0.02-0.6 m·s⁻¹, while fluidized beds operate with D = 0.001-0.6 m²·s⁻¹ and υ = 0.015-0.7 m·s⁻¹. These parameters help quantify the degree of back-mixing and deviation from ideal plug flow behavior, which influences residence time distribution. The char yield obtained in fast pyrolysis is usually slightly higher than the carbon black content of original tire rubber, i.e. in the 25 to 35% range. However, the opposite effect can be observed under slow pyrolysis conditions with a higher extent of secondary reactions, higher char yields, and carbon black adulteration, typically yielding 35-45% char. Reactor type influences these conditions - fluidized beds often operate under fast pyrolysis with high heating rates (10³-10⁴ °C·s⁻¹) and short residence times, minimizing secondary reactions and producing char closer to original carbon black content. Fixed beds typically operate under slower heating rates (5-40 °C·min⁻¹) with longer residence times, promoting secondary condensation reactions that increase char yield and alter char properties through carbon black adulteration. The dispersion coefficient is therefore crucial for reactor design as it determines the residence time distribution in the reactor, which affects the extent of secondary reactions and consequently the balance between char yield and quality.",

Explain the relationship between dispersion coefficients, gas flow velocities, and their combined effect on reactor hydrodynamics, with specific reference to how these parameters quantify deviation from ideal plug flow behavior.",
    "standard_answer": "The dispersion coefficients and gas flow velocities significantly influence residence time distribution and mixing behavior in tire pyrolysis reactors through their effect on hydrodynamic regimes. Fixed bed reactors operate with low dispersion coefficients (0.0-0.02 m²·s⁻¹) and gas velocities (0.02-0.6 m·s⁻¹), resulting in minimal back-mixing and behavior approaching ideal plug flow. This leads to longer residence times and narrower residence time distributions. In contrast, fluidized bed reactors exhibit higher dispersion coefficients (0.001-0.6 m²·s⁻¹) and gas velocities (0.015-0.7 m·s⁻¹), creating intense mixing with significant back-mixing and broader residence time distributions. Conical spouted bed reactors show intermediate dispersion coefficients (5×10⁻⁴-0.06 m²·s⁻¹) with moderate gas velocities (0.1-0.5 m·s⁻¹), while rotary kiln reactors display variable dispersion coefficients (0.0-0.35 m²·s⁻¹) and gas velocities (0-0.7 m·s⁻¹). The dispersion coefficient directly quantifies the degree of back-mixing and deviation from ideal plug flow behavior, determining the residence time distribution in the reactor. Higher dispersion coefficients indicate greater deviation from plug flow and more uniform mixing, while lower values suggest behavior closer to ideal plug flow with minimal axial dispersion. Gas flow velocity affects particle movement and contact efficiency, with higher velocities promoting better mixing and heat transfer. The combined effect determines the extent of secondary reactions in tire pyrolysis, as wider residence time distributions can lead to varying reaction extents for different fluid elements.",
