    "question_text": "Based on the provided paper content, explain how the equivalence ratio (ER) and steam-to-biomass ratio (S/B) influence syngas composition and calorific content during biomass gasification, and discuss how these operational variables affect the progression through primary, secondary, and tertiary reaction stages.",
    "standard_answer": "The paper explicitly states that 'Equivalence ratio (ER) and steam-to-biomass ratio (S/B) are critical operational variables that determine the composition and calorific content of produced syngas.' This indicates that ER and S/B directly control the chemical equilibrium and reaction pathways during gasification. The paper further explains that 'The entire gasification process is divided into primary, secondary and tertiary reaction stages according to the reaction chemistry and temperature ranges.' While the paper does not provide detailed mechanisms for how ER specifically affects each stage, the relationship can be understood through thermodynamic principles. Higher ER values increase oxygen availability, promoting exothermic oxidation reactions that raise gasifier temperatures, thereby accelerating the transition between reaction stages. Lower ER values may favor primary pyrolysis reactions, while moderate ER values optimize the balance between providing sufficient thermal energy through partial oxidation while minimizing complete combustion. The steam-to-biomass ratio similarly influences water-gas shift reactions and steam reforming processes that occur predominantly in the secondary and tertiary stages. The combined effect of these operational variables determines the final syngas composition (H₂, CO, CO₂, CH₄ ratios) and consequently the heating value through controlled progression through the three reaction stages.",
