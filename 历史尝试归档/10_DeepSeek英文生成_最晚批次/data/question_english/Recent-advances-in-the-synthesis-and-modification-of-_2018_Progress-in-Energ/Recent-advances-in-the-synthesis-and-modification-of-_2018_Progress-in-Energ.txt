Graphene, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and derived materials have emerged as promising solutions for
applications in renewable energy storage/conversion devices. No alternatives are known to simultaneously
exhibit large specific surface area, high electrical conductivity, good chemical stability, high mechanical
strength and flexibility. This review article is a collection of some of the most relevant research efforts pub-
lished in the last few years focusing on the synthesis and modification of graphene/rGO as well as doped
and hybrid bi-dimensional carbon materials. For research on graphene growth, the choice of precursor and
physical state (gas, solid or liquid) has been proved to be as important as the environment and synthesis
approach. On the other hand, research focused on graphene oxide reduction has relied on the development
of simple and efficient techniques for rGO conversion and device structuring. Modifications applied to gra-
phene (during synthesis) or rGO (during reduction) have included doping, decoration with nanoparticles
and the formation of composite microstructures. Fabrication of electrodes based on graphene/rGO for appli-
cation in energy storage and conversion has been reported, including relevant performance data from real
devices (supercapacitors, lithium ion batteries, fuel cells or solar cells). This review concludes with a brief
discussion of some of the possible directions for promising research in the area of graphene/rGO fabrication
for energy conversion and storage devices.

1. Introduction

PSince its discovery, graphene has been the most extensively stud-
ied 2D material due to its exceptional properties, such as high theo-
retical surface area (2600 m2 g¡1) [1], excellent thermal conductivity
(4840(cid:1)5300 W m¡1 K¡1) [2], extreme mechanical properties (tensile
strength up to 130 GPa, elastic modulus of 1000 GPa) [3,4] and ultra-
high electron mobilities (2 £ 105 cm2 V¡1 s¡1) [5,6]. Graphene is
made up of sp2 hybridized carbon atoms bonded together in a one-
atom thick plane consisting of a repeating pattern of hexagons [7,8].
Mass production of graphene remains an elusive goal, due to expen-
sive and difficult processing. In this context, graphene oxide (GO),
with oxygen-containing groups attached to the graphene sheets
(GSs) as shown in Fig. 1, has attracted the attention of researchers
[9(cid:1)11]. GO is usually produced by the chemical oxidation of graphite
with subsequent dispersion and exfoliation [10]. The presence of
oxygen-containing functional groups in the basal plane (epoxy and
hydroxyl) and the sheet edges (carbonyl and carboxyl) allows GO to
interact with a wide range of metal oxides, so that functional hybrids
and composites with unusual properties can be utilized for energy
storage [12-16]. These functional groups render GO strongly hydro-
philic, generating good dispersibility in many liquids and providing
potential advantages for easier device processing [17(cid:1)20]. The oxy-
gen-containing groups on GO surfaces strongly affect its electronic,
mechanical, and electrochemical properties [21]. By promoting the
total or partial reduction of GO, a material akin to graphene and
exhibiting similar property values can be generated; this reduction
product is named reduced graphene oxide (rGO). Alternatively, the

Pfunctional groups in GO may work as sites for chemical modification
or functionalization, further extending the scope for achieving a
wide range of chemical and physical properties.

PThere are some well-known approaches for the reduction of GO
utilizing thermal energy (thermal annealing, microwave and photo-
reduction) and chemical energy (chemical reduction, electrochemi-
cal reduction, solvothermal reduction and photocatalytic reduction).
These are frequently used for removal of oxygen-containing func-
tional groups from GO surfaces [22]. Photoreduction and photocatal-
ysis provide excellent alternatives for replacing harsh chemical and
high temperature treatments for GO reduction [23(cid:1)29]. Schematic
representations of graphite, graphene and GO containing epoxide,
hydroxyl, carbonyl and carboxyl groups are shown in Fig. 1a(cid:1)c [30].
PResearch on environment-friendly energy conversion and storage
devices and their practical application has attracted increasing
attention in the past decades [31,32]. Lithium ion batteries (LIBs),
supercapacitors (SCs), fuel cells and solar cells are some of the most
attractive devices which are currently under intense development
[33(cid:1)37]. Fig. 2 shows the synthesis of graphene/rGO applying vari-
ous approaches and its application for different kind of energy stor-
age/conversion. Graphene, rGO and related hybrids with unique
targeted properties have an important role to play as enabling mate-
rials in this vigorous research effort.

PIn this work we tried to provide a comprehensive review of the
latest developments in the synthesis of graphene and the process of
GO reduction. As the knowledge about the factors involved in the
formation of graphene evolved along the years, the synthetic strate-
gies started to incorporate a combination of operations, becoming

Pincreasingly more difficult to classify into any particular category.
For this reason, the corresponding text was organized according to
the types and physical states of the precursors used for graphene
synthesis. For the conversion of GO to rGO, a more common classifi-
cation based on the techniques for GO reduction was adopted. The
review concludes with a collection of results obtained through the
application of graphene/rGO in electrodes for energy storage and
conversion and a brief discussion on the fabrication strategies per-
ceived as having greater potential for yielding high performance
devices in the near future.

2. Graphene synthesis from carbon-containing substances

PVarious methods have been used to prepare 2D carbon based
materials,
including both top-down and bottom-up approaches.
CVD, laser assisted synthesis, hydrothermal/solvothermal synthesis,
micromechanical exfoliation, electrochemical methods, exfoliation
and thermolysis etc. are some of the most popular graphene synthe-
sis strategies, but several other techniques have also been reported.
CVD growth is an effective technique for obtaining mono-layer or
few-layer graphene (FLG) films using various kinds of gaseous, liquid
and solid precursors. In this method the thermal decomposition of
carbon sources on appropriate substrates generates the graphene
layers. Laser-based approaches for localized graphene synthesis and
modification have been developed and applied to the fabrication of
various electronic devices. Direct writing of graphene patterns for
micro-supercapacitors (MSCs), flexible electrodes, field effect-tran-
sistors, and sensors are some of the examples.

2.1. Synthesis from gases

PEdwards and Coleman [38] reviewed the CVD synthesis of gra-
phene layers on a variety of polycrystalline metal and metal alloy
substrates using gaseous precursors. They reported syntheses car-
ried out across a range of experimental conditions, providing insight
into key factors affecting growth. The role of different metals in the
task of assisting the growth of high-quality graphene layers is a valu-
able knowledge. Specifically, group 8 metals (Fe and Ru), group 9
metals (Co, Rh and Ir), group 10 metals (Ni and Pt), and group 11
metals (copper and gold) can support the growth of graphene films.
Stainless steel and other commercial Cu(cid:1)Ni alloys have also been
successfully used as substrates for graphene film growth [38]. The
formation of monolayer to FLG deposits by CVD on metal surfaces
such as Ni [39(cid:1)48], Cu [49(cid:1)58], Pt [59(cid:1)65], Au [66], Co [65,67(cid:1)69],
Fe [57,70], Pd [71], Re [72], Rh [73], Ru [74(cid:1)77], Ir [78,79] and

Pgraphitic [80] substrates have also been reported. Practical nano-
electronic devices require 2D materials to be deposited or trans-
ferred onto dielectric surfaces. Several research groups have synthe-
sized high-quality CVD graphene on insulators or semiconductors
like h-BN [81,82], sapphire [83], SiC [84,85], Si3N4/Si [86], ZrO2 [87]
and MgO [88].

P2.1.1. Hydrocarbons

(cid:3)

PMethane (CH4) gas has been extensively studied as the carbon
source in the CVD process and it is one of the most common gaseous
precursors for growing graphene films [89,90]. The Cu and Ni are the
most widely used catalysts for graphene synthesis due to their low
cost, etchability and large grain size [91,92]. Continuous, highly flex-
ible and transparent graphene films were grown on Ni substrates by
Gomez De Arco et al. [39]. For the CVD processing, Ni films were
thermally evaporated onto pre-cleaned Si/SiO2 substrates up to a
thickness of »1000 A
and the Ni-containing substrates were heated
for 8 min at 900 °C under H2 and CH4 flow rates of 600 sccm and
100 sccm, respectively [39]. Graphene has been synthesized on poly-
crystalline Ni, with several numbers of layers and therefore various
film thicknesses [40(cid:1)42,47]. The controlled carbon precipitation on
polycrystalline Ni surfaces in atmospheric CVD induces the growth
of large area single- and bi-layer graphene [40]. By controlling both
the CH4 concentration and the substrate cooling rate the authors
could significantly improve the graphene thickness uniformity, with
87% film area containing one- or two-layer graphene regions. The
regions grew across multiple grain boundaries of the underlying
polycrystalline Ni film and the number density of sites with multi-
layer graphene/graphite ( > 2 layers) was reduced as the cooling rate
decreased [40].

PGraphene was grown by CVD using CH4 on single crystal Ni (111)
and polycrystalline Ni substrates at different annealing rates (175 °
C min¡1, 58 °C min¡1 and 27 °C min¡1) [41]. For polycrystalline Ni
samples, the slower thermal annealing favors the formation of Ni
(111) grains with few grain boundaries. Graphene was synthesized
using CH4 by CVD at 900 °C at atmospheric pressure, and a cooling
rate of 16 °C min¡1 was used down to 500 °C. The preferential forma-
tion of monolayer/bi-layer graphene on Ni (111) was attributed to
the atomically smooth surface and the absence of grain boundaries.
However, the synthesis on polycrystalline Ni leads to a higher per-
centage of multi-layer graphene ( (cid:2) 3 layers), implying that the pres-
ence of grain boundaries in Ni might serve as nucleation sites for
multi-layer growth. Fig. 3 shows schematic diagrams of the mecha-
nisms for the formation of graphene during carbon segregation and
precipitation on Ni (111) (Fig. 3a) and on polycrystalline Ni (Fig. 3b)

Psurfaces. Carbon diffuses into bulk Ni, and then segregates and
precipitates onto the Ni surface. In the carbon/Ni (111) system,
uniform segregation of carbon on the surface was observed, thus
forming single-layer graphene. In the carbon/polycrystalline Ni
system, the Ni surface is heavily populated by grain boundaries,
which allow the accumulation of carbon at these sites during the
segregation phase and lead to the formation of multi-layer gra-
phene [41].

PStefan et al. [42] described the formation of FLG films on sput-
tered polycrystalline Ni thin films (500 nm) on SiO2/Si substrates by
CVD at 900(cid:1)1100 °C using Argon, H2 and CH4 gases. The high tem-
perature and Ar pressure during Ni deposition promoted the growth
of Ni films with bigger grain sizes and (111) orientation. High
annealing temperatures and short times yielded larger Ni grains free
of surface defects due to hydrogen blisters [42].

PThe CVD grown graphene requires a process for transferring onto
a desired flexible substrate for further electronic applications. Such
transfer process is inconvenient and may also cause additional con-
tamination, wrinkling, and breakage of the graphene, with potential
problems in the final electronic devices. Bosc(cid:1)a et al. [93] developed
an advanced technique that automatically transfers graphene (com-
mercially available CVD monolayer graphene on 25 mm-thick Cu
foil) to an arbitrary target substrate via an all-fluidic manipulation of
the graphene to avoid mechanical damage, strain and contamina-
tion. The process is assisted by a combination of capillary and elec-
trostatic repulsion forces between the graphene and its container to
center the film with respect to the target substrate. This process for
automatic transfer of graphene demands no handling skills, showing
good reproducibility and large throughput. Kim et al. [94] reported a
simple method for large-scale growth of graphene patterns on Ni
films (300 nm thick) deposited on SiO2/Si substrates and its transfer
on stretchable substrates. They patterned the Ni film before growing
graphene by the CVD method using gas mixtures (CH4: H2: Ar
50:65:200 sccm) at 1000 °C. The cooling rate was critical for sup-
pressing the formation of multilayer graphene and for efficiently
separating graphene layers from the substrate. The patterned films

Pwere transferred to stretchable substrates by simple contact meth-
ods, and the number of graphene layers was controlled by varying
the thickness of the catalytic metals, the growth time and/or the
ultraviolet treatment time. The growth, etching, and transferring
processes for the large scale CVD-grown graphene films are shown
in Fig. 4 [43].

PReina et al. [40] synthesized large area FLG films on polycrystal-
line Ni substrates via ambient pressure CVD (at 900(cid:1)1000 °C) using
5(cid:1)25 sccm and 1500 sccm flow of CH4 and H2, respectively, for
5(cid:1)10 min. The use of ambient pressure and Ni films enables the
inexpensive and high-throughput growth of graphene over large
surface areas with properties closer to micro-cleaving highly ori-
ented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG). The Ni films were e-beam evapo-
rated onto Si/SiO2 substrates and thermally annealed before CVD
synthesis, generating a Ni film microstructure with grain sizes
between 1 and 20 mm. Fig. 5 shows AFM and optical images of as-
grown graphene films consisting of regions having 1(cid:1)12 graphene
layers, with single- or bi-layer regions up to several micrometers in
lateral size [40].

PCopper has low carbon solubility and thus even at high tempera-
tures, graphene forms at the surface with negligible carbon dissolu-
tion into the bulk. This enables a self-terminating monolayer growth
unlike, for example, on Ni where growth proceeds by carbon segre-
gation from the bulk [54]. Lee et al. [56] obtained wafer-scale, ambi-
ent-pressure CVD growth of high-quality graphene films on 3 in.
diameter SiO2/Si substrates coated with Cu (700 nm thick) or Ni
(300 nm thick). The substrates were heated up to 1000 °C under
ambient pressure with flowing H2 and Ar (or He). Graphene growth
proceeded by flowing reaction gas mixtures (CH4: H2: Ar = 250: 325:
1000 sccm for Ni and CH4: H2: He = 50: 15: 1000 sccm for Cu) for
»5 min. The FLG grew on the Ni catalyst (3(cid:1)8 layers), while mono-
and bi-layer graphene was formed on the Cu catalyst. Fig. 6a(cid:1)e

PThe growth of graphene with average domain sizes of »140 mm2
was reported by Li et al. [53] for low-pressure CVD using controlled
CH4 and H2 exposure on Cu foils (25 mm thick) at 1025 °C. The films
were polycrystalline, with domains having areas of tens of square
micrometers [53]. Luo et al. [55] and Lee et al. [56] reported that by
using the CVD method under ambient pressure conditions, graphene
growth on polycrystalline Cu films using CH4 as the carbon source
occurred readily and was continuous across Cu grain boundaries.
Electro polished Cu metal surfaces and low CH4 concentrations
enabled the growth of uniform, large size single layer graphene [55].
The flat surface morphology and low CH4 concentration were crucial
factors leading to enhanced homogeneity and electronic transport
properties of the resulting graphene layers. Similarly, chemical
mechanical polishing of Cu foils resulted in improved graphene films
compared with unpolished samples and this was attributed to the
reduction in graphene nucleation sites on the smoother metal surfa-
ces [57].

PThe relatively higher melting temperature (1768 °C) and lower
thermal expansion coefficient (8.8 mm m¡1 K) of Pt can reduce sur-
face atom agglomeration and rough morphology at the high temper-
atures of CVD graphene growth, hereby decreasing the density of
wrinkles after the sample cooling process [59]. Platinum introduces
minimum effects on the electronic properties of graphene due to the
weak Pt-graphene interactions [59]. The CVD growth of uniform
mono-layer and bi-layer graphene films on Pt substrates was also
achieved by Kang et al. [60] using CH4 as carbon source. In this study,
the temperature was found to be a crucial factor for adjusting gra-
phene thickness, with thicker films ( > 5 layers) being produced at
higher temperatures. The Pt films (100 nm thick) were deposited on
SiO2/Si substrates and annealed at 1050 °C before graphene synthe-
sis which took place at the 1050(cid:1)1250 °C temperature range [60].
The growth of centimeter-scale graphene on polycrystalline Pt foils
by the CVD method using CH4 gas at 1050 °C has also been reported
[64]. The graphene layers grew mainly according to the symmetries
of Pt (111), Pt (110), and Pt (100) facets, leading to hexagonal lattices
and striped superstructures. The carbon lattices grown on neighbor-
ing Pt grains with different orientations were connected seamlessly,
enabling graphene growth from nanometer to micrometer levels.
Graphene deposits formed on Pt foils exhibited smoother surfaces
than those grown on Cu foils, with the growth of monolayer

Pgraphene on Pt foils being dictated by a surface-catalyzed mecha-
nism [64].

PThe growth of graphene on Au has been extensively studied
because the interaction between graphene and the gold substrate
can change the optical properties of graphene [95]. Oznuluer et al.
[66] described the ambient-pressure CVD growth of graphene on
thick (25 mm) Au foils and studied the effects of growth tempera-
ture, pressure, and cooling rate on the graphene layers formed. The
partially (111) oriented gold surfaces exposed to CH4 at 850(cid:1)1050 °
C produced a high percentage of mono-layer graphene. Tempera-
tures in this range had a minimal effect on graphene thickness and
defect concentration, but higher temperatures resulted in the forma-
tion of highly defective multi-layer graphene. Fig. 7 shows a sche-
matic representation of the steps in the process for growing
graphene layers on Au foil and their transfer onto SiO2/Si substrates.
The foils were heated up to 975 °C under Ar/H2 flow and CH4 gas
was then introduced in the CVD chamber (10 sccm for 10 min) [66].
PThick graphene nanosheets (GNSs) have been effectively synthe-
sized using CH4 gas without any catalyst or pre-deposition treat-
ment using a variety of substrates. Wang et al. [96,97] reported the
synthesis of GSs with thicknesses of less than 1 nm (1(cid:1)3 graphene
layers) on a variety of substrates including metals, semiconductors
and insulators (Si, W, Mo, Zr, Ti, Hf, Nb, Ta, Cr, 304 stainless steel,
SiO2, and Al2O3). They used radio-frequency (RF, 13.56 MHz) PECVD
without any catalyst or special substrate treatment. The GSs were
produced from a gas mixture of 5(cid:1)100% CH4 in H2 (pressure
»12 Pa), at 900 W RF power and 680(cid:1)900 °C substrate temperatures
[96,97]. Zhu et al. [98] investigated the growth mechanism and per-
formed structural analysis of atomically thin and self-aligned verti-
cally oriented GSs produced by RF PECVD (13.56 MHz) deposition
using CH4 diluted at various concentrations (5(cid:1)100%) in H2, at
600(cid:1)950 °C. The electric field during RF PECVD induces dipoles in
the GSs, helping to generate the observed self-aligned vertical orien-
tation [98].

PFreestanding and vertical FLG has also been synthesized by
microwave PECVD on different substrates [99,100]. Alexander et al.
[99] reported the synthesis of freestanding FLG containing microme-
ter size flakes via microwave PECVD (2 kW microwave power) with-
out any catalyst. Successful graphene growth was achieved on the
surface of different substrates (including quartz, stainless steel,

CH4: H2 ratio of the gas mixture was 1:8 with a total flow rate of
200 sccm at the deposition pressure of 40 torr. FLG deposits were
obtained for various growth times ranging from 1 to 3000 s [99].
Fig. 8a,b shows the typical morphology and overall dimensions of
the GSs, which are aligned vertically in relation to the substrate sur-
face. The average thickness of the flakes varies between 4 and 6
atomic layers, as revealed by TEM analysis (Fig. 8c,d). The expected
hexagonal atomic lattice structure of graphene was confirmed by
results of electron diffraction and STM experiments (Fig. 8e,f).

PThe flame synthesis method for fast graphene processing offers
simplicity, high efficiency and low cost
the advantages of
[101(cid:1)103]. Menon et al. [101] reported the synthesis of graphene on
different metal substrates in an open atmosphere using a flame
burner with CH4 gas. The substrate material, temperature and
hydrogen treatment strongly affected the quality and uniformity of
the graphene films. The growth of FLG occurred at the temperature
range of 750(cid:1)950 °C for Cu and 600(cid:1)850 °C for Ni and Co. The
unique synthesis configuration employed in this work is based on a
non-premixed flame burner, where the oxidizer is in the center por-
tion of the flame and the fuel (e.g., CH4) injected in the outer region
surrounds the oxidizing gas. Menon et al. [102] also showed that the
advantages of this specific flame synthesis method are scalability for
large-area surface coverage, increased growth rates, high purity and

Pyield, continuous processing, and reduced costs due to the efficient
use of fuel as both heat source and reagent. Additionally, by adjust-
ing local growth conditions, other carbon nanostructures, including
carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were readily synthesized [104]. The FLG
films were grown on 25-mm-thick Cu and Ni foils. Prior to the syn-
thesis, the metal substrates were reduced in a hydrogen environ-
ment to remove surface oxide layers. For FLG film synthesis, CH4
was used as the fuel on depositions lasting 5 min for Ni and 10 min
for Cu substrates.

PGraphene synthesis has been achieved by employing direct laser
irradiation of thin metal substrates in the presence of hydrocarbons
and other reducing gases, even at room temperature (more pre-
cisely, without any other means of substrate heating) [105(cid:1)107].
Park et al. [105] have reported the synthesis of graphene by laser-
induced CVD with a continuous wave laser (Nd: YAG, λ = 532 nm). In
this approach, laser irradiation was applied to a thin Ni foil in CH4/
H2 gas mixtures. The local heating generated graphene patterns on
precisely controlled positions. In this process, patterns of 10 mm2
area grew in 0.2 s, a much shorter time than in the conventional
thermal CVD method. Jiang et al. [107] have reported a fast and sim-
ple technique to fabricate FLG nano-ribbon films. The films were
formed at room temperature at the gas ratio (CH4: H2: Ar = 1:4:5) by
scanning a continuous wave laser (2000 W, λ = 1064 nm) on a Ni sub-
strate. According to the authors, laser scanning speed was the most

Pimportant parameter in the synthesis of FLG, whereas the quality of
the films was controlled by varying the laser power. Uniform gra-
phene nano-ribbons (GNR) (width = 1.5 mm, length = 16 mm) were
obtained in a few seconds using a scan speed of 1.3 mm/s, and a laser
power of 600 W. The schematic experimental setup for synthesis is
shown in Fig. 9a. Fig. 9b(cid:1)e show optical images of the samples
obtained at a fixed laser power (600 W) with different scanning
speeds (3.0, 2.5, 2, and 1.3 mm/s). The inset in Fig. 9b shows the sur-
face of a bare Ni substrate. At scanning speeds of 2.5 and 2 mm/s, a

Pfew dark spots can be seen in Fig. 9c,d and these spots were identi-
fied as FLG islands.

PGraphene growth on Pt has been studied under ultrahigh vacuum
(UHV) conditions by Gao et al., which reported the growth of gra-
phene by direct decomposition of C2H4 on Pt (111) surfaces at about
800 K [59]. With an C2H4 exposure of 37.6 L the quality of graphene
was improved due to sparse nucleation. The authors found that the
proportion of different rotational domains varies with the growth
temperature and the graphene quality was improved by adjusting

Pmoir(cid:1)e structures with different unit cells. The growth kinetics is
affected by the initial orientation of the graphene nuclei [62].

PUsing C2H4 gas as precursor, Ru and Ir have also been used as sub-
strates for the synthesis of high quality monolayer graphene over
large areas. V(cid:1)azquez de Parga et al. [77] reported epitaxial fabrica-
tion of high quality, periodically rippled graphene mono-layers and
islands on Ru(0001) under UHV conditions
(base pressure
4 £ 10¡11 torr). The epitaxial graphene mono-layers uniformly cov-
ered the substrate over lateral distances larger than several microns.
The graphene layers were produced either by controlled segregation
of C from the bulk of the substrate or by thermal decomposition
(1000 K) of C2H4 molecules pre-adsorbed on the Ru surface at 300 K
[77]. Vo-Van et al. [79] showed that extremely high quality, large
area, single-layer graphene can be prepared by UHV CVD on single
crystalline Ir films grown on sapphire [a-Al2O3 0001] wafers with
C2H4 as a carbon precursor. The Ir films (a few nanometers thick)
were prepared by pulsed laser deposition on the sapphire wafers.
The graphene films had a very low density of defects, with their
structural quality being as high as that of graphene produced on
bulk Ir single crystals [79].

PStudies of CVD-grown graphene on Fe substrates report multi-
layer graphene formation at low pressure and relatively low temper-
atures. Han et al. [57] synthesized graphene on thick Fe foils
(100 mm) using thermal CVD with C2H2 as the carbon source. For
low C2H2 flow rates and short exposure times, single to FLG sheets
partially covering the Fe substrate were formed. With the appropri-
ate exposure times and C2H2 flow rates, continuous graphene layers
were obtained at temperatures ranging from 600 to 800 °C [57].
Condo et al. [70] studied the hot-filament CVD synthesis of multi-
layer graphene over Fe catalyst with a mixture of C2H2/Ar gases
(1:9) at 1000 °C. The as-synthesized multilayer graphene films
exhibited different thicknesses. The growth of thin, high-quality
graphene on Fe required a careful balancing of parameters like
Fe thickness and temperature. Iron films 6(cid:1)20 nm thick yielded
multilayer graphene growing on the top of CNTs, while for Fe
films < 5 nm, only CNTs were formed. Thinner GSs were obtained
on thicker Fe films. The graphene thickness was increased and
the defects were decreased for higher growth temperatures [70].
Ramon et al. [65] synthesized large-area graphene on Co, a
complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)-compatible
metal, using C2H2 as a precursor in a plasma-enhanced CVD-
based method. The number of graphene layers was influenced by
the Co film thickness and the deposits were predominantly
monolayer (»80% monolayer surface coverage) and exhibited
high mobility values of »1600 and »1000 cm2 V¡1 s for holes
and electrons, respectively.

[62] studied the growth of graphene on Pt (111) and the interaction
between graphene and substrate using C2H4 as carbon precursor
around 1000 °C. Graphene on Pt can be grown by carbon segregation
from the bulk or by a self-limiting decomposition of carbon-contain-
ing substances at the Pt surface. The weak interaction between
monolayer graphene and the metal substrate leads to the formation
of many rotational domains, giving rise to two distinct families of

P2.1.2. Other gases

PBesides hydrocarbons, other carbon-containing gases such as CO
and CO2 have also been used for the synthesis of graphene. Kim et al.
[108] reported the synthesis of GSs by reduction of CO. The method
involved the calcining of aluminum sulfide (Al2S3) under a mixed
gas flow of CO and argon. The reaction of CO with Al2S3 produced
a-Al2O3 and GSs. A more oxidized form of carbon has been also used
for the synthesis of FLG by Chakrabarti et al. [109]. They described a
new methodology that can be potentially scaled up, directly captur-
ing CO2 to produce FLG. Although the exact mechanism of the forma-
tion of graphene was not provided, the high temperature generated
during the burning of magnesium metal undoubtedly plays a crucial
role in the process.

PNitrogen-doped (N-doped) graphene (substitutional doping) may
also be synthesized using the CVD approach by introducing appro-
priate gas, liquid or solid reactants during growth [46,110(cid:1)112].
Nitrogen atoms are incorporated into graphene layers as pyridinic,
pyrrolic, and graphitic forms. Qu et al. [46] synthesized N-doped gra-
phene on a thin Ni film layer deposited on SiO2/Si substrate by sput-
ter coating. The substrates were heated up to 1000 °C in an argon
atmosphere and a nitrogen-containing reaction gas mixture (NH3:
CH4: H2: Ar 10:50:65:200 sccm) was introduced into the quartz tube
and kept flowing for 5 min. The doped graphene was used for oxygen
reduction in fuel cells where the N-doped graphene electrodes
yielded a steady-state catalytic current three times higher than the
one for Pt/C electrodes over a large potential range [46]. C2H4, pyri-
dine (C5H5N) and acrylonitrile (C3H3N) molecules were found to
form graphene upon contact with suitably heated Pt(111) substrates
[63]. The growth of N-doped graphene was strongly dependent on
the temperature of the Pt substrate and the choice of carbon and
nitrogen source materials. The optimal substrate temperature was
found to be 500 °C for N-doped graphene synthesized from C5H5N.
Exposure to C3H3N also produced graphene, but nitrogen doping
was not observed at any of the substrate temperatures investigated.
Fig. 10 shows a schematic illustration of possible growth mecha-
nisms for the two precursor molecules [63].

2.2. Synthesis from liquids

PThe use of liquid precursors in the synthesis of graphene has been
reported for benzene (C6H6), xylene (C8H10), toluene (C7H8), hexane
(C6H14) methanol (CH3OH), ethanol (C2H5OH), propanol (C3H8OH),

cal Society.

Pmonoethanolamine (C2H7NO), dimethylformamide (C3H7NO) and
various natural carbon-containing precursors [50,113(cid:1)124]. Negishi
et al. [80] described the layer-by-layer (LbL) growth of graphene by
CVD on graphene templates prepared by the mechanical exfoliation
of graphite crystals. They used C2H5OH as the carbon feedstock in a
custom-built CVD apparatus where the furnace was divided into
three zones with independent temperature control. The authors con-
sidered that CVD processing using multi-temperature zones could
provide better control and wider temperature windows, more
appropriate for growing graphene layers. Typical
temperature
ranges for thermal decomposition of ethanol and graphene growth
were 870(cid:1)900 °C and 680(cid:1)740 °C, respectively, with an Ar flow rate
of 30 sccm [80].

PLiu et al. [103] reported a rapid and low cost transfer-free flame
synthesis method for growing FLG films directly on Ni films (500-
nm-thick) deposited on SiO2/Si substrates by C2H5OH/H2 flame in
less than 2 min. The C2H5OH/H2 flame works as heat source, carbon
source and protective atmosphere during the growth process. The
schematic mechanism for the rapid flame synthesis of FLG on SiO2/Si
substrates is illustrated in Fig. 11 along with TEM images of the sam-
ples.

PSolvothermal processing involves the use of a solvent under
moderate to high pressures and temperatures, facilitating the inter-
action of precursors during synthesis. The reduction of GO through
solvothermal/ hydrothermal route is an important method in the
field of graphene synthesis and reduction [125(cid:1)127]. Solvothermal
processes can be defined as chemical reactions or transformations in
a solvent under supercritical conditions (or in the nearby pressure-
temperature domain) resulting from heating the liquid reactants or
suspensions in closed vessels [128]. Choucair et al. [129] synthesized
graphene samples from non-graphitic precursors in a scalable, low-
cost approach using a solvothermal method based on the common
laboratory reagents C2H5OH and sodium. The reactants gave an
intermediate solid that was then pyrolized, yielding agglomerated
GSs that were dispersed by mild sonication [129].

PMicrowave-assisted synthesis and modification has successfully
been applied in the field of carbon nanomaterial synthesis [130].
Dato et al. [131] reported a method for synthesizing GSs using a sub-
strate-free, atmospheric pressure microwave plasma reactor. The
GSs were synthesized by exposing liquid C2H5OH droplets to an
argon plasma. They also investigated the effects of applied micro-
wave power, gas flow rate, and precursor composition on the sub-
strate-free synthesis of graphene [132]. Based on their findings,
C2H5OH and dimethyl ether have the most appropriate ratio of C, H,
and O atoms for graphene synthesis.

PThe spray pyrolysis-assisted CVD method has also been used for
the synthesis of graphene powder materials in bulk quantities. Her-
ron et al. [133] introduced a simple and scalable CVD approach to
produce FLG platelets using C2H5OH and a sodium compound
(NaOCH2CH3). The authors claim that in this method no additional
metal catalysts are required to produce FLG platelets or graphene
films on substrates. The filtered solution containing sodium and car-
bon compounds was sprayed into a hot tube furnace at 900 °C. For
purification, the resulting powder was suspended in DI water, soni-
cated, filtrated and treated with HCl for obtaining the final product.
Fig. 12a shows a schematic drawing of the spray-CVD apparatus
used for synthesizing graphene platelets. Fig. 12b,c shows TEM
images of the graphene platelets with sizes between a few hundreds
of nanometers and several microns obtained through the method
[133].

PSubstitutional doping, which introduces heteroatoms into the
carbon lattice of graphene, significantly broadens its applications in
a number of devices [134]. Deng et al. [135] used a solvothermal
method for direct synthesis of gram-scale N-doped graphene via the
reaction of tetrachloromethane (CCl4) with lithium nitride (Li3N)
under mild conditions. Fig. 13 illustrates the proposed mechanism

Pfor the formation of N-doped graphene. The reaction between Li3N
and CCl4 was carried out at 250 °C for 10 h in a 40 mL stainless steel
autoclave in nitrogen. The nitrogen content in the graphene could be
controlled in the 4.5¡16.4% range, allowing further modulation of
the properties. Enhanced catalytic activity when compared to pure
graphene and commercial carbon black samples was demonstrated
[135].

PFeng et al. [136] used a low-temperature process to synthe-
size N-doped graphene in large quantities. The material was
demonstrated to act as a metal-free electrode with excellent
electrocatalytic activity and long-term operation stability for

Poxygen reduction in a neutral phosphate buffer solution. Nitro-
gen substitution with 12.5% N/C atomic ratio was reported. The
N-doped graphene applied as the cathode catalyst in microbial
fuel cells gives high power density, comparable to that of the
conventional platinum catalyst [136]. Geng et al. [137] also used
a low temperature solvothermal process for the synthesis of
nanoflower-like, N-doped graphene. Pentachloropyridine was
adopted as both carbon and nitrogen source, reacting with potas-
sium. Electrochemical tests showed that N-doped graphene has a
higher durability as a Pt support for fuel cells than commercial
carbon black (Vulcan XC-72) [137].

PDirect laser-assisted transformation: The direct laser-based techni-
ques for synthesis of various carbon based materials have several
advantages over alternative methods. The direct laser-assisted tech-
niques provides low temperature, shorter reaction times, environ-
mentally friendly, energy saving, catalyst free growth on insulating
substrates, better reproducibility, scalability, excellent control over
experimental parameters [155(cid:1)157]. The laser assisted synthesis of
graphene at room temperature on different substrates has been
studied for various kinds of energy related applications [158]. The
method has been also considered by some authors as a promising
way to shield metals from corrosion [159,160]. Graphene protects
the metal from oxidation due to its excellent barrier properties and
the strong interaction with the substrate. Ye et al. [159] have synthe-
sized graphene on carbon steel using a high power density continu-
ous wave fiber laser (λ = 1.07 mm, Pmax = 2000 W) in Ar (25 L min¡1)
atmosphere. The authors first introduced Ni
into carbon steel
through a laser alloying process (94.08 wt% Ni and 5.92 wt% Fe) at
high power density (21.5 kW cm¡2) with a laser scan rate of
4 mm s¡1. In a second step, a 14 mm thick carbon paste layer
(0.625 g mL¡1 carbon powder in ethanol) was deposited on the car-
bon steel surface using a spin coater. Finally, this pre-coated carbon
source on the Ni/Fe substrate was irradiated by the laser (power
density = 14.1 kW cm¡2, scan rate = 10 mm s¡1) for the growth of
graphene. During laser irradiation of the thick carbon layer, the car-
bon coating transfers the heat to the Ni substrate without melting.
At the melting point of Ni, a molten pool is formed on the substrate
surface which dissolves the carbon from the coating to form Ni(cid:1)C

2.3. Synthesis from solids

PA wide range of solid precursors have been used for the synthesis
of graphene after decomposition at high temperatures. Some
research groups have used natural and solid waste materials as gra-
phene precursors [138(cid:1)143].

P2.3.1. Synthesis from non-graphitic solids

PHigh temperature pyrolysis: Different types of natural solid prod-
ucts have been used as carbon feedstock for growing high quality
graphene [144]. Single, bi-layer and FLG have been synthesized by
CVD pyrolysis of camphor (C10H16O) as a solid precursor on Cu and
Ni catalyst substrates [145(cid:1)147]. Kalita et al. [145] reported the syn-
thesis of large GSs (4(cid:1)13 layers) on polycrystalline Ni by controlled
pyrolysis of camphor in a CVD furnace at 800 °C. The synthesized
graphene was used for the fabrication of transparent electrodes. The
authors claim that this technique is viable as well as scalable for
potential large area optoelectronic applications. In a later report,
Kalita et al. [146] demonstrated a process for producing iodine-
doped graphene films on a Ni substrate. Camphor was mixed with
an iodine precursor for simultaneous evaporation and CVD pyrolysis
at 800 °C, with argon as the carrier gas. Ravani et al. [148] have
reported a similar CVD process for the production of continuous
high quality graphene layers using C10H16O and Ar on polycrystalline
Ni foils at 850 °C. Shams et al. [149] have synthesized FLG by using
camphor leaves pyrolysed under nitrogen atmosphere at 1200 °C.
The samples were then treated using chemical processes and after
sonication FLG suspensions were obtained.

PImpressive graphene synthesis results were obtained by Seo et al.
with unusual carbon sources [150(cid:1)153]. They reported the growth
of vertical GNSs using edible products (honey, sugar, butter, con-
densed milk and cheese) in different physical states [150]. Their
low-temperature (450 °C), plasma-enhanced process does not
require any catalyst or hazardous precursor and uses renewable nat-
ural resources. Another benefit of this approach is that the same pro-
cess works for several precursors. Fig. 14 shows SEM images of
graphene synthesized from edible substances. The GSs grew verti-
cally in relation to the substrate, irrespective of the precursor.

PThe tea-tree extract

is an abundant commercial

resource
obtained by distillation from the leaves of Melaleuca alternifolia,
commonly known as tea-tree. Studies by Jacob et al. [154] have
shown that high quality graphene films can be grown on silicon sub-
strates using the tea-tree extract. Their catalyst-free plasma-assisted
CVD process is a fast, simple, sustainable, scalable and low cost
method for graphene synthesis. According to Ruan et al. [139], inex-
pensive carbon-rich sources can be used without purification to
grow high-quality monolayer graphene on the backside of Cu foils at
1050 °C under vacuum and H2/Ar flow using the CVD method. The
carbon sources tested by the authors included food (cookies and
chocolate), waste (grass, plastic, dog feces) and insects.

phy of graphene observed by optical microscopy and SEM. The

PDirect laser writing (DLW) is a suitable tool for fabrication of high
performance electronic devices in a very short time [161(cid:1)163]. DLW
was used for the fabrication of flexible interdigitated MSCs on a pol-
yimide substrate by CO2 laser induced metalorganic framework
(MOF)-derived graphene (LIMDG) [164]. The authors suggested that

Pspecific attributes of MOFs as precursors and the long-wavelength
laser writing approach (which creates high localized transient tem-
peratures due to strong absorption by lattice vibrations) are both
responsible for the final formation of interdigitated MSCs. Also, DLW
was used for the synthesis and patterning of high quality graphene
on co-sputtered Ni/C thin films on various insulating substrates
using a femtosecond laser (λ = 780 nm) in air at room temperature
[165]. The authors reported that the applied method is cost-effec-
tive, enabling the direct production of graphene patterns on insulat-
ing substrates, thus evading complex transfer processes. Fig. 16a

Pshows a schematic drawing of the DLW process to fabricate gra-
phene on insulating substrates. A variety of patterns are demon-
strated in Fig. 16b(cid:1)e. Line-width of the as-fabricated graphene
patterns is around 800 nm (Fig. 16f). TEM of an as-fabricated gra-
phene pattern shows the formation of bi-layer graphene (Fig. 16g).

PThe energy transferred during direct laser irradiation of a solid
carbon source can rearrange the carbon atoms into a graphene film.
Quartz with photoresist [166], SiC [167(cid:1)169], PMMA on silicon
[170] and polyimide sheets [95] have recently been used for the
growth of graphene without resorting to transition metal catalyst/
templates. Wei [166] and co-workers demonstrated a metal-free
laser-based technique to directly synthesize FLG on insulating quartz
substrates. A continuous wave Nd: YAG laser (λ = 532 nm) was
focused onto an S-1805 photoresist film through the transparent
quartz substrate using a 150 mm focal length lens. The spin-coated
film on quartz wafers was heated (5 min at 120 °C) and irradiated by
laser light in nitrogen gas at 0.1 torr pressure. The carbon atoms
from the decomposed photoresist are dissolved in the molten quartz
and precipitated as graphene on the substrate surface. This graphene
growth route is schematically illustrated in Fig. 17a. Fig. 17b displays
optical microscope images of areas irradiated for different times
showing the progress of graphene formation. For the first 5 seconds,
the surface shows no significant change on morphology. After longer
times, the diameter of the rings where graphene is being formed
increases continuously reaching 50 mm after 5 min of laser heating.
PSiC can be used in the synthesis of carbon materials such as large-
area graphene [170(cid:1)172], carbon nanotubes [171,172], nano-crys-
talline diamond [173], and porous carbon [174]. Under the appropri-
ate conditions, laser irradiation generates local thermal treatment
resulting in the formation of FLG from the carbon atoms in SiC. Lee
et al. [167] reported single step, room temperature epitaxial gra-
phene (EG) growth and micropatterning by laser for rapid prototyp-
ing of devices. The n-type 4H-SiC(0001) substrates, on-axis, cut from
a single crystal wafer, were irradiated with a KrF excimer laser beam
in a UHV chamber (pressure < 10¡9 torr). The laser irradiation was
performed at 1.2 J cm¡2 fluence on a 2 mm2 spot size over a 25 mm2
area of the sample for 500 pulses. Yannopoulos et al. [168] reported
large area homogeneous EG film growth on SiC(0001) surfaces
employing infrared CO2 laser (λ = 10.6 mm) as the heating source in
an Ar atmosphere. Graphene nucleation and growth appeared to be
highly dependent on the morphology of the SiC surface. Choi et al.
[169] have shown that N-doped graphene could be directly synthe-
sized on the surface of an insulating hexagonal SiC substrate by laser
incidence on a solid dopant source. CO2 laser has been also used to
convert Ni/sucrose mixtures into 3D graphene foams (GFs). An auto-
mated metal powder 3D printing method for in situ synthesis of
freestanding 3D GFs was developed [175] . In this work, sucrose and
sintered Ni act as the solid carbon source and catalyst, respectively,
for the growth of graphene. The 3D printed GFs show excellent

Pphysical properties with high-porosity (»99.3%),
low-density
(»0.015 g cm¡3), remarkable storage modulus (»11 kPa), high
damping capacity (»0.06), high-quality and multilayered graphene
features.

PWei et al. [170] have reported the metal-free, laser-induced
growth of FLG on a silicon substrate. The growth was conducted in a
vacuum chamber, at a N2 pressure of »0.1 torr by directing a contin-
uous Nd: YAG laser of 532 nm wavelength on a poly(methyl methac-
rylate) (PMMA)-coated silicon wafer. The diameter of the laser spot
on the sample surface was about 20 mm. The molten silicon absorbs
carbon atoms decomposed from PMMA under laser irradiation, and
these carbon atoms are segregated in the cooling process to form
FLG. The amount of decomposed PMMA (and carbon atoms absorbed
by Si) can be controlled by the laser illumination time, which deter-
mines the number of graphene layers.

PThermal annealing/ heating with chemicals: Shin et al. [176]
reported transfer-free growth of FLG on a dielectric substrate by
pyrolysis of a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of carbon materials
sandwiched between a catalytic metal (Ni) and the SiO2/Si substrate.
Heating was performed under low pressure and the temperature
was increased up to 900 °C in 10 min, maintained at 900 °C for a few
minutes and then cooled to 500 °C in 10 min. After synthesis, the Ni
layer was removed by chemical etching [176].

PYan et al. [177] demonstrated a transfer-free method to directly
grow large areas of uniform bi-layer graphene on insulating sub-
strates (SiO2, h-BN, Si3N4, and Al2O3) from solid carbon sources such
as films of poly(2-phenylpropyl methylsiloxane)
(PPMS), poly
(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), polystyrene, and poly(acrylonitrile-
butadiene-styrene) (ABS). Illustrating a typical experiment, a PPMS
film (»4 nm) was deposited on the SiO2 substrate and a Ni film
(500 nm) was deposited on top of the PPMS film. At a temperature of
1000 °C, with a reducing gas flow (H2/Ar) and under low-pressure
conditions (»7 torr), bi-layer graphene was formed between the
insulating substrate and the Ni film. The Ni film was removed by dis-
solution, leaving the bi-layer graphene directly on the insulator.
Fig. 18 shows a schematic process for the transfer-free growth of
graphene on insulating substrates [177].

PSun et al. [142] reported a one-step method for the for the con-
trolled growth of pristine and doped graphene using solid carbon
sources such as polymer films or small molecules deposited on a
metal catalyst substrate at temperatures as low as 800 °C. The first
solid carbon source used was a spin-coated PMMA thin film
(»100 nm) and the metal catalyst was a Cu film. In the temperature
range between 800 and 1000 °C, under a reducing (H2/Ar) gas flow
and low-pressure conditions, a single uniform layer of graphene was
formed on the substrate. The authors found that by changing the gas
flow rate, the thickness of PMMA-derived graphene can be con-
trolled to give monolayer, bi-layer, or FLG. Li et al. [14] reported the
exfoliation-intercalation-expansion of graphite using H2SO4, HNO3

Pand NaCl to produce high-quality single layer GSs in a stable organic
solvent suspension. The single layer GSs were synthesized by exfoli-
ating expandable graphite at 1000 °C in forming gas. The exfoliated
graphite was subsequently ground with NaCl crystallites and sepa-
rated by dissolving the NaCl in water followed by filtration and
repeated washing. The resulting sample was ultra-sonicated in DMF
(10 mL) solution with TBA (tert-Butyl alcohol) (130 mL). After being
left at room temperature for 3 days to let the TBA fully penetrate
into the graphene layers, the suspension was bath-sonicated and
centrifuged, yielding the final single layer GSs [14]. Liu et al. [178]
reported a mild, one-step electrochemical approach for the prepara-
tion of functionalized graphite sheets with the assistance of an ionic
liquid and water. The graphite sheets were exfoliated into function-
alized GNSs homogeneously dispersed into polar aprotic solvents
without the need for further oxygen-removing reactions. Different
types of ionic liquids and ionic liquid to water ratios were used in
order to evaluate their influence on the electrical properties of GNSs
and graphene-polymer composites.

PPenuelas et al. [179] produced graphene using 6H-SiC(0001) sub-
strates without any additional carbon source by direct annealing the
carbide at various temperatures (1100(cid:1)1300 °C) under UHV. When
the substrate is heated under UHV, Si atoms sublimate and the
removal of silicon leads to a rearrangement of the surface carbon
atoms into graphene layers. The thickness of GSs highly depends on
the annealing temperature and time [179]. An argon atmosphere
was also used for the growth of epitaxial graphene layers on the C-
faces of 4H(cid:1)SiC and 6H(cid:1)SiC [180]. The presence of argon during
growth slows the rate of graphene formation on the C-face. The
argon-mediated growth generated graphene islands, whose appear-
ance was a function of Ar gas pressure and temperature, but islands
were also observed during vacuum growth, implying that Ar does
not change the growth mechanism [180].

PThe growth of graphene on Ni surfaces has also been demon-
strated based on diffusion and segregation of carbon from underly-
ing amorphous carbon (a-C) or nano-diamond films [44,45]. Zheng
et al. [44] reported a simple and efficient method to synthesize gra-
phene layers via metal-catalyzed crystallization of a-C to graphene
during thermal annealing. In this process, the number of graphene
layers was primarily dependent on the initial thickness of the a-C
layer, resulting in highly controllable graphene synthesis. This is in
contrast to CVD processes, where the carbon source is virtually
unlimited and controlling the number of graphene layers depends
on the strict control over a number of deposition parameters.

PGarcia et al. [45] achieved multi-layer graphene growth by pre-
cipitation upon cooling of a thin Ni film deposited by e-beam evapo-
ration on single-crystal diamond (001) oriented substrates. The Ni
acted as a strong catalyst, inducing the dissolution of carbon from
diamond into the metal. Carbon segregation produced multi-layers
of graphene on the top Ni surface. Zhao et al. [181] prepared GSs by

Pflame calcining mixtures of CaCO3 and Mg powder. By this method
they obtained large amounts of high purity graphene at 850 °C.
Besides the GSs, the end products, CaO and MgO, were also obtained
after the reaction.

P2.3.2. Synthesis from graphitic solids

PLaser ablation from graphite: Laser ablation is the process of
removing material from a solid (or occasionally liquid) surface
through laser irradiation. It is a versatile method, used for the syn-
thesis, thin film deposition and patterning of a vast range of materi-
als with applications in many research fields [182]. In the most
common configuration for this process, the output of a pulsed laser
is focused onto a target material maintained at low pressure or at a
pre-determined background gas pressure. Through laser ablation,
carbon clusters of various sizes can be generated simply by irradiat-
ing a graphite surface [183(cid:1)185]. By manipulating the laser energy,
ablated volume and focusing, the graphite can be ablated in the form
of carbon nanoparticles (NPs). A substrate kept at a suitable temper-
ature and placed in front of the target is used to collect the ablation
products.

PLasers with various wavelengths have been used for ablation,
ranging from the mid infrared (e.g. CO2 laser, 10.6 mm) to the ultra-
violet (e.g. KrF excimer laser, 248 nm). By this method, several
researchers have synthesized graphene using different substrates,
substrate temperatures and gas surroundings [186(cid:1)191]. Lenner
et al. [192] reported single-shot femtosecond laser ablation of graph-
ite for the detachment of charged carbon products (graphene nano-
flakes). The laser ablation generates graphite NPs that are recon-
structed into a thin graphene layer at the substrate. The authors also
performed time-resolved measurements of the Coulomb explosion
efficiency as an alternative means to track the lattice dynamics of
solid surfaces in situ and employed this method to study the motion
of the topmost graphene layers of graphite.

PSynthesis of hydrogen-terminated graphene using what the
authors called a “laser vaporization controlled condensation” (LVCC)
method was reported by Afshani et al. [193]. They achieved rapid
deoxygenation of solid bulk graphite oxide in an atmosphere of He
or in a mixture of He/H2 by focusing a Nd: YAG laser (532 nm,
8(cid:1)10 ns pulse width) into a 100 mm diameter spot using a laser
power of 1 mW. The laser vaporization/ionization generated carbon
clusters in the range of 4 to 30 atoms.

PQian et al. [186] have reported free-standing micron-sized FLG
synthesized through laser exfoliation of HOPG using a pulsed Nd:
YAG laser (λ = 532 nm, t = 7 ns). The final product contained three
different phases, namely: amorphous carbon, FLG sheets, and thin
graphite films. Fig. 19a shows the experimental setup for the synthe-
sis of FLG on a Si wafer. First, the chamber was evacuated to the
pressure of 10¡5 torr and then filled with Ar gas at the desired pres-
sure. The target ablation was performed with a repetition rate of

shown in Fig. 20b and Fig. 20c, respectively.

PThe synthesis of FLG on different non-metallic substrates (quartz,
sapphire and n-silicon) has been reported by Xu et al. [188]. An exci-
mer KrF laser (λ = 248 nm, pulse width = 25 ns, repetition rate = 5 Hz)
was used to ablate carbon from pyrolytic graphite in an Ar atmo-
sphere. The ablated material was deposited on the substrate, which
was placed 5 cm apart from the target and kept at 750 °C. The num-
ber of graphene layers formed on the substrate could be controlled
by adjusting ablation time, laser fluence and substrate temperature.
PThe effect of deposition temperature over the formation of gra-
phene layers during laser ablation of graphite was also investigated
by Kumar et al. [189]. They fabricated FLG and multi-layer graphene
on fused silica substrates using a pulsed Nd: YAG laser (fluence
»5 J cm¡2) and varied substrate temperature from room tempera-
ture to 700 °C. Based on the observation of Raman spectra and TEM,
the authors concluded that at room temperature multilayered gra-
phene (»10 layers) is formed, whereas less than five-layered gra-
phene is formed at the substrate temperature of 700 °C.

PLaser ablation carried out in a liquid medium is a simple tech-
nique that allows the fabrication of a number of nano-materials. Due
to its versatility, low cost and ease of execution, the method has
attracted considerable interest [194,195]. One important difference
between laser ablation of solids in a gas ambient and in liquids is
that liquids provide a much stronger confinement, restricting the
expansion of the plasma plume formed in the ablation process [194].
The liquid also brings an environment in which cooling, condensa-
tion and phase formation are all affected. The processes are kineti-
cally different from those taking place in a low pressure gas
atmosphere [196].

PA method for graphene fabrication based on the ablation of
graphite targets inside liquid N2 (¡195.79 °C) with a pulsed nanosec-
ond Nd: YAG laser (λ = 1064 nm) was reported by Mortazavi and co-
workers [190]. As the target is immersed in liquid nitrogen, mono-
layers of 2D-fluid diffuse into the interlayer spacings of graphite.
The infiltration of liquid N2 and the exfoliation by expansion of nitro-
gen during laser heating leads to the formation of GNSs. Fig. 21a

P1 Hz and laser fluences from 0.8 to 20.0 J cm¡2. Silicon substrates
were used to collect the ablated carbon materials in front of the
HOPG target. In the laser fluence range from 1 to 10 J cm¡2, ultrathin
fragments were removed from the HOPG and deposited on the sub-
strate as graphene (Fig. 19b).

PKaushik et al. [187] reported the continuous wave CO2 laser abla-
tion synthesis of graphene ribbons from a pyrolytic graphite target
placed in a vacuum chamber at the pressure of »10¡6 torr. The gra-
phene films were deposited on Cu foils kept at different tempera-
tures and placed »5 cm apart from the rotating target, as shown in
Fig. 20a. Elevating the temperature of Cu to 700 °C led to the forma-
tion of large grains on its surface as shown in the schematic drawing

Pillustrates the irradiation setup. A schematic drawing showing the
structure of graphite infiltrated by N2 and the formation of graphene
by laser ablation are shown in Fig. 21b.

PRusso et al. [191] have reported the formation of porous gra-
phene (PG) and graphene quantum dots (GQDs) using a femtosecond
laser (λ = 800 nm,1 kHz, fluence 20(cid:1)30 J cm¡2). Ablation of HOPG
was performed in a liquid medium (water or liquid N2) for the syn-
thesis of PG and GQDs. The authors suggested that the decomposi-
tion of water plays a crucial role in the process by generating
reactive species. The laser pulses exfoliate the graphite, causing the
detachment of GSs and, subsequently, O2 and H2O2 molecules oxi-
dize the GSs and convert them into GO. The PG flakes consist of one
to six stacked layers of spongy graphene and the GQDs have dimen-
sions of about 2(cid:1)5 nm.

PLiquid phase exfoliation of graphite: Liquid phase exfoliation (LPE)
of graphite to pristine graphene is an attractive approach. LPE of
graphite in various liquid media is a well-known top-down method
for exfoliation of graphite and subsequent stabilization of graphene
in liquid [197(cid:1)200]. The exfoliation of graphite is facilitated by large

Pshear forces generated in the liquid media either through sonication,
high-shear mixing or alternative processes such as wet ball milling
[201]. By applying shear forces to the graphitic layers, the layers are
delaminated from the graphite and subsequently converted into gra-
phene layers. This occurs due to strong internal interaction as well as
solvents that minimize the interfacial tension between the liquid
and the graphitic flakes. Several class of LPE methods for graphite
conversion into graphene have been proposed, however ion interca-
lation, ion exchange and sonication are the main techniques for
exfoliation of graphitic layers, as shown in Fig. 22 [198]. Sonication-
assisted exfoliation is very easy to perform and graphene can be gen-
erated by ultrasonication of graphite in various liquid media. Some
reagents, like benzyl benzoate, 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP), g-
butyrolactone (GBL), N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA), N-vinyl-2-pyr-
rolidone (NVP), and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), are used for
exfoliation because their surface energies mattches for graphene.
These are classified as good exfoliating reagents, while others such
as ethanol, acetone, and water behave like a poor media for graphite
exfoliation because their surface energies are significantly lower

Pthan that of graphene [202(cid:1)205]. Coleman's group first reported the
high-yield production of graphene by the sonication assisted LPE of
graphite in organic solvents such as N-methyl-Pyrrolidinone (NMP)
in 2008 [203]. After that several surfactant systems have been used
for exfoliation of graphite to graphene [206(cid:1)209]. Xu et al. [210]
synthesized graphene from graphite using LPE in an aqueous
medium by tip sonication. Ma et al. [211] have studied the direct
exfoliation of graphite in water (without any surfactants or organic
solvents) with addition of ammonia to get graphene using LPE by
sonication.

PHigh-quality graphene suspensions were prepared directly from
expandable graphite via intercalation and exfoliation using n-butyl
lithium as the intercalating agent, water and DMF as the exfoliating
agent applying sonication [212]. Durge et al. [213] obtained gra-
phene by sonicating natural graphite powder in DMF using a low
power bath sonicator and a high power probe sonicator. High power
sonication for longer time yields exfoliation with fewer graphene
layers. LPE of expanded graphite by sonication in DMF and water
(DMF: H2O = 9:1) was applied to produce GNSs (»2 mm) [214].

PSingle-layer graphene was prepared from natural graphite by LPE
using NMP employing different sonication times [215]. Zhang et al.
[205] reported that graphene can form relatively stable high concen-
tration dispersions in ethanol by mild sonication using a solvent
exchange process from NMP. Desai et al. [216] made highly disper-
sive graphene inks by LPE of bulk graphite in NMP. The viscosity of
the NMP-based ink was changed by addition of poly(3,4-ethylene-
dioxythiophene): poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT: PSS). Single- and
FLG flakes by exfoliation of graphite were reported in NMP, in the
presence of heneicosane linear alkanes terminated with different
head groups [217] . These molecules act as stabilizing agents during
exfoliation by sonication. Perto et al. [218] performed LPE of graphite
using sonication in NMP/NH4OH, sodium cholate and H2O. The inclu-
sion of NH3 during liquid exfoliation helps to prevent the aggrega-
tion of GSs. One to four-layer graphene production were reported in
different solvents (NMP and isopropanol) and surfactants (sodium
dodecyl sulphate and sodium cholate) from flaky graphite using LPE
by ultrasonication [219]. The graphite in the form of millimeter-size
pieces can be more advantageous for extended graphene flakes.
Tubon Usca et al. [220] applied LPE on natural graphite by sonication
or mixer treatments in order to produce FLG suspensions in NMP

Pwith zeolite 4A (Z4A) to improve exfoliation. Singh et al. [221]
reported preparation of graphene via LPE of graphite in organic sol-
vents with addition of anthracene. Anthracene intercalates into the
edges of graphite and results in graphene concentration enhance-
ment. In the presence of anthracene in benzonitrile (BZN) solvent,
the
increased from 0.01 to
0.03 mg mL¡1 and the effect of anthracene in concentration
enhancement was most prominent in NMP, ODCB and BZN solvents.
Sahoo et al. [222] reported one pot synthesis of graphene by LPE of
graphite in a versatile and high boiling point solvent (ODCB) by soni-
cation.

PLPE of graphite was performed by mixing graphite powder in an
aromatic solvent (hexafluorobenzene, octafluorotoluene, pentafluor-
onitrobenzene, pentafluorobenzonitrile, pentafluoropyridine, or pyr-
idine) and sonicating for 5 days [223]. FLG was obtained by LPE of
tetraethylammonium as graphite intercalation compound (TEA-GIC)
by high-power tip-sonication of graphite in TEA aqueous solution
[224]. Noroozi et al. [225] obtained graphene in large quantity with
low defect density by using a high intensity probe sonication in
water containing liquid hand soap and PVP.

PLPE of graphite was used to produce high-quality graphene also
using organic salt such as disodium edetate, sodium tartrate, potas-
sium sodium tartrate and sodium citrate by sonication [226]. Shih
et al. [227] demonstrated a LPE technique using ultrasonication for
the production of large-area, bilayer or trilayer graphene from
graphite, with controlled stacking. The ionic compounds iodine chlo-
ride (ICl) or iodine bromide (IBr) intercalate the graphite starting
material at every second or third layer, creating second- or third-
stage controlled graphite intercalation compounds, respectively and
producing graphene with flake areas as large as 50 mm2.

PElectrochemical exfoliation is part of a growing number of gra-
phene production routes [228]. Typically, HOPG, graphite rods,
graphite foil, graphite powders, or graphite flakes are used as the
working electrode [229(cid:1)231]. Su et al. [232] have demonstrated a
fast electrochemical method in ionic solution to exfoliate graphite
into thin GSs, with a large lateral size. The ionic solution was pre-
pared by H2SO4 diluted in 100 mL of DI water. The electrochemical
exfoliation was carried out by applying DC bias on the graphite elec-
trode (from ¡10 to + 10 V). Fig. 23 shows the experimental setup,
typical AFM image and TEM image of exfoliated GSs which contains

Pbilayer graphene. FLG production was also reported by electrochem-
ical exfoliation via intercalation of tetraalkylammonium cations
[233]. The non-oxidative electrochemical intercalation of tetraalky-
lammonium cations into pristine graphite was achieved in a
solution of 0.1 M TBAClO4 in NMP. A facile processing approach
for synthesis of GNSs using anodic exfoliation of graphite in a
mild NaOH/H2O2/H2O system was also developed [234]. In this
system, H2O2 plays a key role in exfoliation, with exfoliation effi-
ciency drastically increasing between H2O2 concentrations of 0
and 130 mM.

transport properties of

PTransformation of CNTs: Other method for the synthesis of gra-
phene is the unzipping of CNTs to form GNRs. Valentini [235]
reported the formation of short GNRs through a simple and scalable
CF4 RF plasma treatment of single wall CNTs (SWCNTs). Jiao et al.
[236] developed controlled unzipping of CNTs to produce single-, bi-
, and multi-layer GNRs by an Ar plasma etching method. Kosynkin
et al. [237] described a simple solution-based oxidative process for
producing a nearly 100% yield of GNRs by lengthwise cutting of
MWCNTs. The ribbon structures with high water affinity were
obtained by subsequent chemical reduction of the GNRs. The same
unzipping process in SWCNTs was used to produce narrow GNRs,
but their subsequent disentanglement was difficult to achieve. Xie
et al. [238] investigated the atomic structures, Raman spectra and
electrical
(widths
10(cid:1)30 nm) derived from sonochemical unzipping of MWCNTs. Cho
et al. [239] fabricated GNSs by means of radial followed by longitudi-
nal unzipping of MWCNTs grown by catalytic CVD, using a chemical
method with sulfuric acid and nitric acid. The mixing ratio of H2SO4
and HNO3 and the treatment time were varied, and their effect on
the unzipping of MWCNTs was investigated. Kang et al. [240] dem-
onstrated unzipping of flattened double wall CNTs by acid cutting
along the folded edges. The precise unzipping of flattened CNTs
allows the formation of regular GNRs with controlled width and
straight edges. The degree of unzipping and extent of oxidation were
controlled by the acid concentration and reaction temperature.
Kumar et al. [241] explored a single-step method of unzipping
MWCNTs by employing laser irradiation. This method required little
time, yielding GNR samples without surface contamination. In order
to carry out unzipping of MWCNTs, an excimer laser (100(cid:1)500 mJ
energy) was used. The authors also carried out laser irradiation of N-
and B-doped MWCNTs with diameters in the 50(cid:1)70 nm range pre-
pared by CVD. Around 60% of the CNTs were unzipped by this
method.

PThe selection of physical state of precursor for the controlled syn-
thesis of graphene layers is very important. Generally, for the syn-
thesis of single layered graphene by CVD with controlled number of
layers, gaseous or liquid fossil precursors (C2H2, C2H4, CH4, C6H6,
CH3OH, C2H5OH etc.) can be preferred. Synthesis of graphene using
fossil carbon-containing chemicals may be costly and there are dis-
advantages in some cases due to toxicity or explosive character. Fur-
thermore, some precursors are dangerous for the environment and
for the human health. Natural and waste precursors are emerging as
a new class of materials that provide efficiency to produce high qual-
ity graphene/rGO [242,243]. A wide range of greener and environ-
ment friendly liquids and waste precursors are available, which have
several advantages since they are renewable and very cheap when
compared to fossil hydrocarbons for mass production of graphene/
rGO. Several research groups have used natural seed oils, camphor,
plastic, plant extracts (tea-tree extract), foods (cookie, chocolate,
honey, sugar, butter, milk, cheese), vegetal wastes (wood, leaf, grass,
fruit waste), animal/bird/insect waste (bone, cow dung, dog feces,
chicken feather, chicken egg) and agricultural waste for the synthe-
sis of graphene/rGO [123,139,145(cid:1)154,244(cid:1)248]. Thus, research on
natural carbon precursors and waste materials has increased in
recent years as they promise to produce graphene/rGO in large
quantities at low price.

3. Graphene/rGO by modification of graphene-based materials

PThe large scale reduction of graphite oxide/GO into rGO by a com-
bination of high temperature and/or reducing agents is very conve-
nient in applications for energy storage/conversion [249(cid:1)251]. The
resulting rGO resembles graphene, but contains residual oxygen or
other hetero atoms and a bigger concentration of structural defects.
During the reduction process the p-electron conjugation within the
aromatic system of graphite is partially restored. The properties of
rGO are very similar to those of graphene prepared through different
pathways.

3.1. Chemical/thermal methods

PThe chemical reduction of graphite oxide using various surfac-
tant/reducing agents has been used for the synthesis of highly
ordered graphitic carbon, rGO or crystalline graphite/graphitic nano-
platelets [250,252]. Stable aqueous dispersions of polymer-coated
graphitic nanoplatelets were prepared by Stankovich et al. [252]
through exfoliation/in-situ reduction of graphite oxide in the pres-
ence of poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate). The graphite oxide was
produced by the oxidative treatment of graphite. Hydroxyl and
epoxide groups were attached to basal planes, while carbonyl and
carboxyl groups were attached to the edges of GSs in graphite oxide.
The attached oxygen-containing functionalities altered the Van der
Waals interaction between the layers of graphite oxide, rendering
them hydrophilic, thus facilitating their hydration and exfoliation in
aqueous media [252].

PThe chemical reduction of graphite oxide with several com-
pounds revealed that hydrazine hydrate is one of the best reducing
agent for producing very thin graphene-like sheets [22,253]. The
reduction of graphite oxide by hydrazine has already been used
before the discovery of graphene [254], and the use of hydrazine to
prepare chemically derived graphene was first reported by Stanko-
vich et al. [252,255]. The authors prepared graphite oxide from natu-
ral graphite by the Hummers’ method [256] and then reduced the
colloidal suspension of exfoliated GO sheets in water with hydrazine
hydrate. This process yielded materials with graphitic characteristics
that were comparable to pristine graphite. The characterization of
the reduced graphite oxide indicated that hydrazine treatment
resulted in the formation of unsaturated and conjugated carbon
atoms, which in turn imparted high electrical conductivity [255].

PSurfactant-wrapped chemically converted GSs were synthesized
by Lomeda et al. [257] from reduction of GO with hydrazine and
functionalization by treatment with aryl diazonium salts. The result-
ing nanosheets disperse readily in polar aprotic solvents, allowing
alternative avenues for simple incorporation into different polymer
matrices [257].

PXu et al. [258] prepared stable aqueous dispersions of GSs using a
water-soluble pyrene derivative, 1-pyrenebutyrate (PB-), as a stabi-
lizer. The pyrene moiety has strong affinity with the basal plane of
graphite via p-stacking. In their experiment, graphite oxide was syn-
thesized from natural graphite powder by a modified Hummers’
method. To prepare a PB-functionalized graphene (PB(cid:1)G) suspen-
sion, NaOH and pyrenebutyric acid were added to disperse graphite
oxide, then this mixture was reduced with hydrazine monohydrate.
The reduction provided a homogeneous black dispersion with a
small amount of precipitation. Large area flexible PB(cid:1)G films with
layered structure showed a conductivity seven orders of magnitude
larger than that of the graphite oxide [258].

PBecerril et al. [259] synthesized water-processable single layer
GO by a modified Hummers’ method. The graphite flakes were
treated with NaNO3, KMnO4, H2SO4 and H2O2 for complete oxida-
tion. Thermal treatments and hydrazine monohydrate were used for
chemical reduction of GO. Fig. 24 shows AFM height images of spin-
coated GO films. The as-synthesized GO and GO heat-treated and

Pexposed to hydrazine vapor have different values of surface rms
roughness (Rq) [259].

PHydrazine-treated and annealed GO thin films with low sheet
resistance were also prepared by Eda et al. [260]. They found that
the thinnest films exhibit graphene-like ambipolar transistor charac-
teristics, whereas thicker films behave as graphite-like semimetals
[260]. Si and Samulski [261] reported an easy and scalable route to
isolated, water-compatible graphene, in which the majority of oxy-
gen-containing functional groups was removed. The resulting gra-
phene was in the form of single carbon sheets exhibiting an
electrical conductivity comparable to graphite. The graphene from
GO was prepared in three steps. (i) pre-reduction of GO with sodium
borohydride to remove the oxygen-containing functional groups (ii)
sulfonation with the aryl diazonium salt of sulfanilic acid and (iii)
post-reduction with hydrazine to remove remaining oxygen-con-
taining functional groups. After the final reduction step, the lateral
dimensions of graphene ranged from several hundred nanometers
to several micrometers. The AFM images shown in Fig. 25a(cid:1)c con-
firm that evaporated dispersions of GO and graphene are composed
of isolated graphitic sheets and Fig. 25d shows a TEM image of a sin-
gle graphene layer [261].

PG(cid:1)omez-Navarro et al. [262] described the synthesis and proper-
ties of chemically prepared rGO sheets for electronic transport. First,
GO was synthesized via the Hummers(cid:1)method and the resulting oxi-
dized material was dispersed in water under mild ultrasonication
and then deposited onto different substrates (mica, Si/SiO2, and
HOPG). The individual GO sheets were subjected to chemical reduc-
tion by hydrazine or hydrogen plasma and then electrically charac-
terized as a function of temperature and external electric fields.
Chemical reduction resulted in a pronounced increase in conductiv-
ity. In both reduction methods, the time evolution of conductivity
displayed a plateau, followed by a decrease upon further exposure.
This plateau was reached after 24 h of treatment with hydrazine and
very quickly (after 5 s) in the case of hydrogen plasma treatment
[262].

PFan et al. [263] followed a green route for the large scale synthe-
sis of graphene with excellent dispersibility in water. The fast
removal of oxygen-containing groups on exfoliated graphite oxide
was achieved with the help of strong alkaline solutions (NaOH or
KOH solutions) at moderate temperatures. Graphite oxide was

Pprepared and purified according to the Hummers method. Yellow-
brown GO suspensions were obtained by dispersing graphite oxide
in distilled water under intense sonication (100 W, 40 KHz, 1 h). In
order to prepare aqueous graphene suspensions, the graphite oxide
suspensions and NaOH or KOH solutions (8 M) reacted inside a dou-
ble-walled vessel subjected to mild sonication (25 W, 40 kHz) and
hot (50(cid:1)90 °C) water flowing through the outer chamber of the ves-
sel. The addition of NaOH or KOH to the graphite oxide suspensions
improves the solubility of the alkyl free-radical initiator, which is
carboxyl terminated. The reaction was accompanied by a fast color
change in the suspension from yellow-brown to homogeneous black
(Fig. 26) [263].

PParedes et al. [264] produced functionalized GSs through rapid
thermal expansion of graphite oxide at 1050 °C. The GNSs were
obtained by chemical reaction with a reducing agent (hydrazine
monohydrate) at low temperature. The chemically reduced nano-
sheets displayed a smoothly undulated morphology, with typical
vertical variations in the sub-nanometer range. They could be readily
discriminated from their unreduced counterparts through phase
imaging in tapping-mode AFM, probably because of differences in
hydrophilicity arising from their distinct oxygen contents [264].

PGeng et al. [265] proposed a route to produce GSs starting with
the direct exfoliation of natural graphite flakes by ultrasonication in
formic acid. The graphene aqueous dispersions were obtained by
chemical oxidation of the graphite NPs to graphite oxide nanoplate-
lets, followed by chemical reduction to graphene using a hydrazine
solution [265].

PGraphene thin films with very low concentrations of oxygen-con-
taining functional groups were produced by Akhavan [266]. The
authors reduced GO nanosheets using two different heat treatment
schedules in a reducing environment. The first treatment was per-
formed at a higher temperature (1000 °C) in a one-step reduction
procedure, with the formation of thin films composed of single layer
GNSs with a minimum thickness of 0.37 nm and almost without any
functional groups. Similar, high-quality graphene thin films were
obtained at a lower temperature of 500 °C in a two-step reducing
procedure. This indicated that the efficient reduction of GO thin
films was possible at even lower heat treatment temperatures [266].
PThe FLG sheets were produced in gram scale by a low-tempera-
low pressure

Penvironment by Lv et al. [267]. The graphite oxide powder (synthe-
sized by modified Hummers method) was exfoliated at low-temper-
atures (as low as 200 °C) under high vacuum. Fig. 27 shows TEM

Pimages indicating the presence of thin, homogeneous micrometer-
sized flakes composed of one to seven graphene layers [267].

PZhu et al. [53] reported the exfoliation and thermal reduction of
suspensions of GO platelets in propylene carbonate (PC). Heating of
GO suspensions at 150 °C effectively reduced the GO platelets.
Graphite oxide powder (synthesized by the modified Hummers
method) was dispersed in PC (concentration of 1 mg mL¡1) and soni-
cated for the formation of GO suspensions. For thermal reduction,
the suspensions were heated in an oil bath with magnetic stirring
[53].

heating the pristine exfoliated-GO suspension without the hydroxides. The three
reactions were carried out at 90 °C for 5 h with the aid of sonication. One should
notice that no obvious color change is apparent in the control sample, even after pro-
longed heating at relatively high temperatures [263]. Reprinted (adapted) with per-

PResearchers are constantly challenged to consider more environ-
mentally friendly methods for the fabrication of new materials, com-
ponents and devices. The rapid reduction and exfoliation of graphite
oxide/GO are very important for performing more accurate experi-
ments within a shorter time period, with low energy input and with-
out
[268,269].
Microwave-assisted reduction and exfoliation fulfills the promise of
being a rapid and facile technique because of the deep MW penetra-
tion causing nearly volumetric heating of materials.

PResearch articles have been published on MW assisted synthesis
of nanostructured materials such as metals [270(cid:1)272], nanoporous
materials [273,274], colloidal nanocrystals [275], inorganic nanoma-
terials [276,277] and polymer nanocomposites [278]. As expected,
MW assisted synthesis was successfully applied in the field of carbon
nanomaterials, because carbon materials interact strongly with MW
radiation yielding fast heating rates. Thus, nanostructured carbon

P[286(cid:1)297] and metal oxide supported on carbon nanotubes have
been obtained by MW-assisted synthesis [298(cid:1)300]. Besides metal
oxide supported CNTs and graphene, other types of carbon materials
have been synthesized and investigated for various applications, e.g.
three-dimensional carbon composites, activated carbon, carbon
nanocapsules, etc.

PSeveral researchers have adopted microwave techniques for the
reduction and exfoliation of graphitic carbon materials [301(cid:1)303].
Wei et al. [304] obtained exfoliated graphite materials by microwave
processing over a short period of time (4 min). Under MW irradia-
tion, a marked exfoliation of the precursors is accompanied by fum-
ing and lightning sparks. Tryba et al. [305] have shown the
exfoliation of graphite using MW irradiation at room temperature in
a short time with low energy consumption. Hu et al. [306] investi-
gated the response of oxidized graphite with varying degrees of oxi-
dation under MW irradiation. A local heating stimulated by
graphene creates an avalanche-like deoxygenation reaction of GO,
triggering graphene conversion.

PChen et al. [307] reported a rapid thermal reduction of GO to gra-
phene under mild conditions with the assistance of microwaves in a
mixed solution of N,N-dimethylacetamide and water. The mixed
solution works as solvent for the produced graphene and a medium
to control the temperature of the reactive system up to 165 °C.

PFalcao et al. [308] have prepared exfoliated graphite from a potas-
sium-THF co-intercalation compound using MW irradiation. Zhu
et al. [309] reported a versatile MW method to simultaneously exfo-
liate and reduce graphite oxide within 1 min. The simple synthesis
route provides scalable and cost-effective production of easily pro-
cessable graphene materials. Jiang et al. [310] presented a facile and
novel method to fabricate FLG (about 3(cid:1)8 layers) via microwave-
assisted NH3 intercalation-exfoliation of graphite. The MW irradia-
tion has been employed in the initial step, in order to increase the
interplanar spacing of graphite. The process of graphene formation
by microwave-assisted intercalation exfoliation is schematically
illustrated in Fig. 28.

3.3. Laser treatment of GO

PPatterning of various types of electronic circuits and optical devi-
ces is a challenge, particularly for the development of energy genera-
tion and storage devices. Different types of techniques including
DLW, photolithography, nano imprinting, scanning probe lithogra-
phy, etc. are continuously being developed for obtaining features at
the nanometer to micrometer length scale. Among these methods,
direct laser patterning of carbon-containing materials is very attrac-
tive for the fabrication of graphene-based devices because it does

Pnot require complex processing, the use of dangerous chemicals or
post-fabrication treatments [311(cid:1)315]. For reduction by lasers with
a wavelength < 390 nm (energy > 3.2 eV), the GO to rGO conversion
should be triggered by a photochemical process, whereas for lasers
with wavelengths > 390 nm (energy < 3.2 eV), photo-thermal effects
must account for the GO reduction [316].

P3.3.1. Gas media

PGraphite oxide has been converted into reduced graphene
employing different laser sources and atmospheres [317,318]. GO,
TiO2 and TiO2/GO composites were synthesized by matrix-assisted
pulsed laser evaporation (MAPLE) in a controlled O2 atmosphere
[319]. The MAPLE target dispersions were prepared using distilled
water as solvent matrix, with TiO2 NPs and GO platelets serving as
host materials. Two different laser sources, a free-running IR Er: YAG
(λ = 2940 nm, tfwhm ffi350 ms, n = 10 Hz) and a UV KrF excimer
(λ = 248 nm, tfwhm ffi 25 ns, n = 10 Hz), were used for the transfer and
immobilization experiments by infrared (IR)- and ultraviolet (UV)-
MAPLE, respectively. Reduction of graphite oxide to graphene by
pulsed laser irradiation has also been studied by Trusovas et al.
[320]. The graphite oxide samples were treated with a pico-second
laser (10 ps, 100 kHz) working at 1064 nm with a laser power of
50 mW. Modeling of the temperature dynamics during processing
revealed increases in temperature of up to 1400 °C at the surface
and up to 600 °C inside the 300 nm thick graphite oxide layers. At
these temperatures most of the carboxyl, hydroxyl and epoxide
groups are removed from the graphite oxide, reducing it to gra-
phene.

PA single-step technique was reported by Strong et al. for the gen-
eration and electronic tuning of graphene-based materials using an
infrared laser (λ = 788 nm) [321]. This inexpensive method was
employed in the fabrication of graphene-based NO2 gas sensors,
using a common CD-drive laser-scriber on thin flexible substrates.
The DLW process using a continuous wave diode laser with wave-
length of 663 nm and a maximum output power of 80 mW can also
be employed for reducing and cutting multilayer GO films, as shown
by Zhou et al. [322]. DLW of micron-sized lines on insulating GO thin
films with a continuous-wave diode laser (λ = 532 nm) has also been
demonstrated [323]. Applying the focused beam over GO films
deposited on SiO2/Si substrates, conductive strips 1 mm wide could

Pbe directly patterned either as a channel in the GO matrix, or as a
stand-alone microbelt.

PZhang et al. [324] reported the fabrication of graphene microcir-
cuits on GO films via direct laser reduction processing with a femto-
second laser (790 nm wavelength, 120 fs pulse width and 80 MHz
repetition rate). The beam was focused onto the GO films by a £ 100
objective lens with a high numerical aperture (NA = 1.4). The electri-
cal conductivity of as-reduced graphene strongly depended on the
output power of the laser. Fig. 29a presents a schematic illustration
of the femtosecond DLW technique used by the authors. The reduced
micropatterns observed by both optical microscopy and AFM are
shown in Fig. 29b,c and Fig. 29d,e, respectively, for two different pat-
terns.

PMask-free and programmable patterning of graphene by ultrafast
DLW using femtosecond laser on GO films has been reported by
Chen et al. [325]. At lower laser power, the patterns are not clear
due to the incomplete reduction of GO. At higher laser powers, some
of the laser scanned regions were ablated, leaving a defective micro-
pattern. The optimized power between 3 and 8 mW was considered
as suitable for GO patterning. Bandgap tailoring and synchronous
micro-device patterning of GO can also be performed by DLW for
field effect transistors (FETs) using femtosecond laser [326]. During
the laser irradiation of GO solutions spin-coated on quartz sub-
strates, oxygen content in the reduced regions could be modulated,
setting the band gap of rGO.

PA versatile technique to create a 3D GO(cid:1)rGO stacked-layer struc-
ture with the added attribute of defining micro-patterns in each
layer was presented by Fatt Teoh et al. [327]. The focused laser beam
(λ = 532 nm) was used to convert GO to rGO on a heated substrate
with spin-coated GO. By tuning the laser power and the temperature
of GO during the patterning operation, rGO (positive development)
or GO (negative development) could be preferentially removed from
the SiO2 substrate by ultrasonication in acetone-water mixtures.
Direct patterning of rGO circuits on a GO thin film using KrF excimer
laser (λ = 248 nm, 20 ns pulse width and 200 mm s¡1 scanning speed)
has also been studied [328]. The nanosecond laser directly defines
the patterned circuits on the GO film, causing significant reduction
in resistivity.

PSokolov et al. [317] converted graphite oxide to reduced gra-
phene via continuous-wave (532 nm) laser excitation in both air and
N2 ambient. For comparison, irradiation of graphite oxide using the

Pfrequency-doubled (532 nm) and frequency-tripled (355 nm) out-
puts of a pulsed ((cid:5) 9 ns, 20 Hz) Nd: YAG laser was also carried out
[317]. P(cid:1)erez del Pino et al. [329] studied the UV laser irradiation of
films composed of GO and GO-Fe3O4 NPs deposited on PDMS sub-
strates. The laser irradiations were performed in vacuum and NH3-
rich gas environments. They demonstrated that GO-based films with
different types of oxygen- and N-containing chemical groups can be
obtained by laser treatment. Further laser irradiation induces the
reduction of initial GO and transformation of pyridinic N(cid:1)(cid:1)O to
amine groups, and to graphitic nitrogen in ammonia ambient. A pho-
tochemical method for the simultaneous reduction and doping of GO
through UV KrF excimer laser (20 ns pulses, λ = 248 nm, 1 Hz repeti-
tion rate) irradiation in the presence of a dopant precursor gas
(50 torr Cl2 or NH3 gas) was developed [330]. A few seconds of laser
irradiation was sufficient to dope the GO lattice and the doping and
reduction level was controlled by varinge laser irradiation time. This
method was also employed for the in-situ laser induced modification
of prefabricated GO field effect transistors.

PBy splitting the laser output into two beams and recombining
them on the same spot in the sample surface, periodic grating pat-
terns can be generated. The sample can be rotated and exposed fur-
ther, enabling the formation of bi-dimensional grids of transformed
regions. These operations are performed on static samples, preclud-
ing the use of motion control equipment. This two-beam laser inter-
ference technique has been used for the simultaneous reduction,
patterning and nanostructuring of GO for superhydrophobic [331]
and humidity sensing applications [326]. Wang et al. [331] reported
that the contact angle of water on the graphene surface could be
tuned by either tailoring the amount of surface functional groups, or
by controlling the surface roughness. This unique photoreduction
method using two laser beams allows the formation of hierarchical
micro-nanostructures with the simultaneous modulation of the
chemical composition. Both periodic grating micropatterns and
nanoscale layered structures formed during the laser-induced
removal of oxygen functional groups contribute to the superhydro-
phobic features.

PTwo-beam laser interference reduction, patterning and nano-
structuring of GO for the production of flexible humidity sensing
devices using a Nd: YAG laser on flexible PET substrates was
reported by Guo et al. [332]. When two laser beams irradiate the GO
film at the same position, removal of oxygen-containing groups
takes place in the regions of constructive interference. By tuning the
laser power, the conductivity could be controlled, affecting the
response/ recovery times of the sensors. Fig. 30a shows a schematic

Prepresentation of GO patterning by two-beam laser interference
reduction. The SEM images in Fig. 30b(cid:1)e show the change in the
width of the rGO lines on GO films reduced under different laser
powers.

P3.3.2. Liquid media

PVarious research groups have studied the reduction of graphite
oxide/GO suspended in liquids using different laser sources. In their
research they tested different values of pulse energy and duration,
focal point position, lens focal length, exposure time, and concentra-
tion of graphite oxide/GO in suspension. The advantage of perform-
ing the laser-induced conversion in a liquid is that the natural
motion of the suspended solid causes the constant exposure of new
surfaces to the laser. The presence of basic species in solution helps
to disperse the graphene flakes.

PChemical-free laser reduction for synthesis of graphene in aque-
ous suspension using 532 and 355 nm lasers has been reported by
Abdelsayed et al. [333]. The irradiation time required for deoxygen-
ation of graphite oxide varies from a few to several minutes. The
degree of deoxygenation depends on laser power and the concentra-
tion and volume of the graphite oxide suspension.

PThe reduction of GO suspended in ammonia has also been
reported using high-power laser sources [334,335]. A simple
approach to form rGO in the presence of ammonia employing
248 nm excimer laser irradiation was adopted by Huang et al. [334].
In the presence of ammonia, GO was reduced after laser irradiation
for 5 min at room temperature in a quartz flask. The ammonia solu-
tion inhibited the aggregation of rGO after the pulsed laser irradia-
tion. Ghadim et al. [335] also reduced GO sheets in ammonia
solution at room temperature using a pulsed nanosecond laser
(λ = 532 nm, P = 0.3 W). N-doped rGO in bulk form was also synthe-
sized by laser irradiation of GO dispersed in an aqueous solution of
ammonia [336]. A pulsed Nd: YAG laser with different emission
wavelengths (IR λ = 1064 nm, Vis λ = 532 nm, and UV λ = 266 nm)
were employed for the preparation of the N-doped rGO samples. The
UV and Vis laser irradiations yielded higher N doping. With the
increase of laser fluence, the opposite trend was observed for the IR
processing. High level of N-doping (4.9 at% N) was achieved with UV
laser radiation at a fluence of 60 mJ cm¡2.

3.4. Green/environmentally friendly reduction

PRecently, researchers are seeking to replace toxic and harmful
chemicals and petroleum-based reducing agents with natural

0.3 W. The insets show magnified images and results of theoretical calculation of laser intensity distributions for each condition [332]. Reprinted (adapted) with permission from

Pand Karak [345] reported green reduction of GO by aqueous phyto-
chemicals which were obtained using aqueous leaf extracts of Colo-
casia Esculenta and Mesua Ferrea Linn and an aqueous peel extract of
orange (Citrus Sinensis). The rGO exhibited good specific capacitance
(17(cid:1)21 F g¡1), high electrical conductivity (3032.6(cid:1)4006 S m¡1) and
high carbon to oxygen ratio (5.97(cid:1)7.11). The group also reported
reduction of GO by a green sonochemical approach using the com-
bined effect of sonication and Fe3+ ions in the presence of aqueous
extracts of Colocasia Esculenta leaves [346]. The reduction occurred
very fast (in 3 min), while 8 min was required without sonication.
The GO was also reduced using seven different types of plant leaf
extracts (Cherry, Magnolia, Platanus, Persimmon, Pine, Maple, and
Ginkgo) [347]. The cherry leaf extract was found to be most effective
among the seven plant leaf extracts used for the reduction of GO.
Suresh et al. [348] used spinach (Spinacia Oleracea) leaves as an effi-
cient green reduction agent to produce multifunctional rGO. The
resulting RGO exhibited high potential antioxidant activity. Guruna-
than et al. [349] reported that Ginkgo Biloba extract (GbE) is a natural
reagent for the synthesis of water-soluble and cytocompatible gra-
phene since GbE acts as a reducing and stabilizing agent. The bio-
compatibility of the prepared Gb-rGO was investigated using a
water-soluble tetrazolium 8 assay on human breast cancer cells. GO
exhibited a dose-dependent toxicity, whereas Gb-rGO-treated cells
showed significant biocompatibility and increased ALP activity com-
pared to GO. Mhamane et al. [350] demonstrated single step reduc-
tion of graphite oxide into GSs from the aqueous extract of four
different plants (Potamogeton Pectinatus L., Ceratophyllum Demersum
L., Lemna Gibba, and Cyperus Difformis). For this purpose, graphite
oxide solution was mixed with each of these plant extracts sepa-
rately and refluxed at 90 °C for 24 h. The results revealed that the
properties of the plant extract-converted GS are comparable to
chemically converted GSs. Jana et al. [351] demonstrated the green
reduction of GO using drained water from soaked mung beans (Pha-
seolus Aureus L.). The resultant rGO exhibits good specific capaci-
tance with 98% retention even after 1000 charge(cid:1)discharge cycles.
Suresh et al. [352] reported a facile green method for the effective
reduction of GO using Cloves (Syzygium Aromaticum) extract by a
reflux method at 100 °C for 30 min. Kartick et al. [353] reported a
green route for the synthesis of graphene by reduction of graphite
oxide with Cocos Nucifera L. (coconut water) as reducing agent which
is naturally available, non-toxic and environmental friendly. Chu
et al. [354] further used Hibiscus Sabdariffa L. extract to reduce GO
and the rGO exhibited a good specific capacitance.

PBovine serum albumin (BSA) is a globular protein derived from
cows. Proteins are complex amphiphilic biopolymers, featuring
hydrophobic and hydrophilic patches on their surfaces, which make
them well-known for the adhesiveness to solid surfaces [355,356]. It
has been demonstrated that BSA is a good reducing agent and stabi-
lizer due to its amino acid moiety in the tyrosine residue. Liu et al.
[357] reported BSA conjugated GO and rGO formation. The change in
conjugation conditions (temperature and/or pH) provided two dif-
ferent types of complexes, mainly BSA-GO and BSA-rGO conjugates,
as shown in Fig. 32. The phenolic groups of tyrosine are probably
ionized only at high pH values, affecting electron transfer to GO. The
protein adsorbs onto the rGO surface possibly by hydrophobic and
p-p stacking interactions. The BSA-GO and BSA-rGO conjugates pro-
vide a scope for synthesis of different metal NPs such as Pt, Pd, Au,
and Ag [357].

PGlutathione is a protein made from three amino acids: glutamate,
cysteine and glycine. L-glutathione (GSH) is known as reduced gluta-
thione and composed of a single glutathione molecule with the addi-
tion of a sulfhydryl group. It is a natural antioxidant capable of
reducing many reactive oxygen species. Pham et al. [358] have
reported a green approach for reduction of GO using GSH in an aque-
ous solution under mild conditions. The synthesized rGO shows
good dispersion stability in DI water and several polar aprotic

Pmaterials. A large number of natural products which are considered
to be green/environmentally friendly have been tried for synthesis
and reduction of GO [337].

PTea extract has been frequently used for the reduction of GO.
Green tea is a popular beverage worldwide and rich in polyphenolic
compounds, whose content is about 10(cid:1)15% in green tea leaves
[338]. The tea polyphenols (TPs) are biocompatible and biodegrad-
able and mainly consist of epicatechin (EC), epicatechin gallate
(ECG), epigallocatechin (EGC) and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG).
The structures of these compounds are shown in Fig. 31a [339].
Wang et al. [340] reported synthesis of soluble graphene via a green
reduction of GO in tea solution. The presence of TPs in the tea solu-
tion acts as both reducing agent and stabilizer and thus enables the
solubility in water and a variety of organic solvents. The synthesized
rGO shows a conductivity of 53 S m¡1 and good dispersion in polar
solvents such as ethanol, methanol, acetone, DMF, NMP, DMSO, and
N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc). The method for synthesis of solu-
ble graphene is illustrated in Fig. 31b. In another work, green and
low-temperature (40 °C) GO reduction by increasing the antioxidant
activity of green TPs in the presence of iron was demonstrated [341]
of. The GO reduced by green tea solution in the presence of iron at
reduction temperatures of 40(cid:1)80 °C was found to be comparable to
hydrazine-reduced GO and better than the GO reduced by green tea
alone.

PTannin substances constitute the third major class of plant com-
ponents after cellulose and lignin. The abundant units of catechol
and pyrogallol in tannin molecules give them unique reducing char-
acteristics. Tannic acid (TA), one of the typical hydrolysable tannins,
is mostly extracted from the oak apple. Lei et al. [342] reported
hydrolysable tannin as environmentally friendly reducer and stabi-
lizer for GO. The GO suspensions were stirred with tannin for 10 h at
80 °C. The resultant rGO was found to be easily dispersible in etha-
nol, DMF, and DMSO, but it exhibited poor solubility in THF, acetone,
2-propanol and chloroform. Bo et al. [343] reported a new, green
and efficient reducing agent (caffeic acid/CA) for GO reduction. The
CA-rGO shows a high C/O ratio (7.15). Gas sensors and SCs made
with this CA-rGO show good performance. The presence of natural
antioxidants in rose water makes it a green reducing agent. The rose
water reduced and stabilized exfoliated graphite oxide (rGO) exhib-
ited good dispersibility in aqueous solution for more than 1 month
and the electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy shows a low
charge transfer resistance of rGO at 0.18 kV (graphite oxide: 28 kV,
bare glassy carbon: 0.40 kV) [344]. Other phytoextracts have also
been shown to be reducing agents for the reduction of GO. Thakur

Psolvents, including THF, DMF and DMSO. The proposed mechanism
shows that GSH is able to release a proton and it undergoes intermo-
lecular reactions with another GSH to form a glutathione disulfide as
revealed in Fig. 33. The released protons bind to the oxygen func-
tional groups present on the surfaces of GO, subsequently being
released as water molecules.

PGelatine is a linear polypeptide consisting of different amounts of
18 amino acids which is generally prepared by the partial hydrolysis
of collagen, the chief protein component in skin, bones and white
connective tissues [359]. It contains triple helical structure and
offers distinctive advantages, such as excellent membrane-forming
ability, good adhesion, biocompatibility, biodegradability, non-toxic-
ity, and is non-immunogenic. Due to these characteristics, it is
widely utilized in the food and pharmaceutical industries [360,361].
An et al. [362] demonstrated the formation of rGO by stirring GO
with gelatin solution for 24 h at 95 °C. The biocompatible gelatin-
rGO shows excellent dispersibility and stability in water and in vari-
ous solutions. Gelatin-rGO also demonstrates a high drug-loading
capacity for methotrexate (MTX) and the release of MTX from
MTX@gelatin-rGO in a pH-dependent manner.

PHumanin, a 24 amino acid mitochondrial polypeptide chain

(Met-Ala-Pro-Arg-Gly-Phe-Ser-Cys-Leu-Leu-Leu-Leu-Thr-Ser-Glu-
Ile-Asp-Leu-Pro-Val-Lys-Arg-Arg-Ala) with a molecular weight of
2656.3 Da, was first identified from a cDNA library of surviving neu-
rons in the human Alzheimer's disease brain [48]. Gurunathan et al.
[363] have used humanin as an agent for GO reduction. The good

Pwater dispersibility of the resulting rGO is reflected by the lower
amount of protein dispersant residue found on its surfaces. The elec-
trical conductivity of rGO was measured to be 105 S m¡1 and that of
GO 0.05 S m¡1. Both Bacteriorhodopsin [364] and Herceptin [365]
have also been demonstrated to have the potential to reduce GO.

PGallic acid (3,4,5-Trihydroxybenzoic acid) is a natural organic
acid and widely used as an effective antioxidant in the areas of food
processing, food packaging and toiletries in order to prevent rotting
induced by lipid peroxidation and spoilage [366,367]. Xiao and co-
workers [368] have used gallic acid for the reduction of GO in the
presence of ammonia solution. There are three adjacent hydroxy
groups present on its benzene ring and thus it might show consider-
able reducibility. On this basis, it is significant to mention that pyro-
gallol has also been established as an efficient reductant of GO [369].
The reduction process was carried out at room temperature (24 h
stirring) and 90 °C (6 h stirring). The as-synthesized rGO exhibits dif-
ferent conductivity at different condition; 0.96 S m¡1 (room temper-
ature, 24 h stirring) and 36 S m¡1 (90 °C, 6 h stirring). The as
synthesized rGO could be dispersed in various solvents such as
water, NMP, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), DMF and methanol due to
the presence of the adsorbed oxidized gallic acid.

PHeparin, a straight-chain anionic glycosaminoglycan, is widely
used as an anticoagulant. Wang et al. [370] have used heparin for
the reduction of GO and preparation of functionalized rGO in aque-
ous solution. The heparin acts as reducing agent and an effective sta-
bilizer. Highly negative charge density of heparin can prevent the

Paggregation of rGO in aqueous solution by strong electrostatic repul-
sion. The synthesized heparin-rGO showed good biocompatibility to
cells in vitro. Blood anticoagulation results shows that the heparin
rGO could inhibit both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of coagula-
tion.

PMelatonin (MLT, N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine), a lipophilic
hormone produced by the pineal gland, has been used for reduction
of GO.MLT can work as a potent antioxidant, in addition to its func-
tionality as synchronizer of the biological clocks in animals and
plants. In fact, MLT acts as good scavenger of reactive oxygen/nitro-
gen species, due to its electron-donating properties. In contrast to
usual antioxidants, MLT is known as a suicidal antioxidant because it
does not contribute to the reduction(cid:1)oxidation cycling. Esfandiar
et al. [371] have used MLT for the reduction of GO. The reduction
was carried out in the presence of ammonia (pH 9(cid:1)10) at 80 °C for
3 h in order to prevent aggregation of rGO and promotion of the
reduction rate. Higher amounts of nitrogen are adsorbed on rGO
with the use of MLT. The rGO-MLT showed good dispersion stability
due to the presence of the oxidized melatonin, which adsorbs on the
surface of rGO via p(cid:1)p interaction.

PZhao and co-workers [372] used urea as a green reagent for
reducing graphite oxide to rGO. Urea works by removing oxygen
containing groups from graphite oxide under alkaline conditions.
The obtained rGO was easily dispersible in water, ethanol, 2-propa-
nol, ethylene glycol (EG), and DMF. The rGO displayed excellent
cycle stability and superior capacitive performance, indicating that
urea is a good reducing agent for mass production of graphene-
based materials for energy storage.

PThe large number of natural antioxidants also includes micro-
organisms (bacteria), vitamins, amino acids, saccharides, all of which
can be readily used to reduce GO. Different kinds of nature-based
microorganisms as Escherichia coli bacteria [373,374], Shewanella
bacteria [375,376], gram-positive bacteria, Bacillus subtilis [377],
extremophilic bacteria [378], baker's yeast (containing NADPH)
[379] and bacterial cellulose (gluconacetobacter xylinus) [380] has
been used for the green reduction of GO. Different types of vitamins,
such as vitamin C [369,381] and vitamin B2 [382] have been also
used for the reduction of GO. Saccharides are considered another
class of essential nutrients that are used as reducing agents. Zhu
et al. used reducing sugars such as glucose, fructose, and sucrose in
aqueous ammonia solution for the reduction of GO [383]. Kim et al.
reported the use of dextran (polysaccharide) in aqueous ammonia
solution for reduction of GO [384]. Akhavan et al. demonstrated that
GO can be reduced by glucose under neutral conditions in the pres-
ence of Fe foil, which acts as a photocatalyst [385]. Different kind of
amino acids like glycine [386], L-cysteine [387] and L-lysine [388]
have also been used for the reduction of GO. Bacteriorhodopsin
[364] and herceptin [365] also have exhibited potential for GO
reduction.

PAfter the discovery of graphene, several synthesis methods have
been reported by various research groups using different kind of car-
bon-containing precursors, as already discussed in the preceding
text. Some of the synthesis methods like mechanical exfoliation,
CVD, epitaxial etc, are useful only for production of microgram
amounts of graphene for laboratory research into electrical/optical/
thermal related devices and applications. Among these CVD is maxi-
mally utilized for the growth of large area (upto meter dimension)
single and few layer grapheme required in several applications like
transparent conducting electrodes, transistors, ultrathin electromag-
netic shielding film, osmotic energy production, highly selective sin-
gle molecule gas detection, desalination, DNA sequencing, etc. [389].
But these methods are not scalable or suitable for the mass produc-
tion needed for large scale fabrication of energy storage devices. On
the other hand, chemical oxidation of graphite and its reduction by
various approaches have the potential to achieve the production
rate of rGO in an industrial scale. Highly reduced and fully exfoliated

PrGO contains tiny amounts of oxygen and a few layers (nearly 1(cid:1)4
layers) with a somewhat defective structure in their morphology.
This kind of rGO does not show the similar class of properties (e.g.
electrical/optical/thermal) as seen in pristine graphene, but highly
reduced and fully exfoliated rGO shows the best performance in
energy storage/conversion applications and is frequently used in SCs
and batteries. The physical defects on rGO surfaces helps electrolyte
penetration deep inside the material and the small amount of oxy-
gen functionalities anchors the metal/metal oxides for formation of
hydride materials which are also useful for energy storage applica-
tions.

4. Application in energy conversion and storage

PWith the depletion of fossil fuels and increasing environmental
pollution, among other factors, it is ever more urgent to develop
clean and sustainable sources of energy, as well as new technologies
associated with energy conversion and storage [144,390(cid:1)394].
Some of the most efficient technologies for energy conversion and
storage are solar cells, fuel cells, batteries and electrochemical
capacitors (ECs) [395(cid:1)402]. The batteries and ECs have been receiv-
ing enormous attention as energy sources for electric vehicles, cell
phones and other mobile electronic devices. Graphene, its deriva-
tives and hybrid materials are well suited for these applications. Gra-
phene-based hybrid materials consist of metal/metal oxide NPs
strongly attached to negatively charged oxygen-containing func-
tional groups on the surface of oxidized graphene [403].

4.1. Supercapacitors

PSupercapacitors deliver much higher capacitance than conven-
tional capacitors. A SC device contains two electrodes with high sur-
face area or redox-active materials separated by an electrolyte layer.
The conventional capacitor stores charge by polarization of the
dielectric between the two plates, but in SCs, the charge is stored in
the electrodes themselves. Based on the charge storage mechanism,
SCs can be divided into two categories as electric double layer
capacitors (EDLC: stores charge from ion adsorption and desorption)
and pseudocapacitors (stores charge by Faradic reactions). Nowa-
days, SCs are receiving great attention for its potential applications
in electric and hybrid electric vehicles because of their ability to
store energy, alongside with the advantage of delivering the stored
energy much faster than batteries [404]. The high electrocatalytic
activity makes graphene an alluring material for electrochemical
energy storage [405(cid:1)409]. Graphene-based SCs have been shown to
exhibit high power density, excellent reversibility and long cycle life
[410(cid:1)414].

PSahu et al. [415] synthesized lacey rGO nanoribbons for SCs
applications. The holes created during synthesis enhanced the
electrolytic accessibility and helped to expand and exfoliate the
stack of graphene layers through protrusions at edge planes and
corrugation in individual GSs. The SCs exhibited high energy/
power density: 15.06 W h kg¡1/ 807 W kg¡1 in aqueous electro-
lyte at 1.7 A g¡1, 90 W h kg¡1/ 2046.8 W kg¡1 in non-aqueous
electrolyte at 1.8 A g¡1, and 181.5 W h kg¡1/ 2316.8 W kg¡1 in
ionic electrolyte at »1.6 A g¡1 as shown in Fig. 34a. Zhang et al.
[416] developed highly conductive, free-standing, and flexible
porous carbon films by simple KOH activation of rGO paper. The
SCs constructed with these films as electrodes yielded outstand-
ing power and frequency performance, while simultaneously
maintaining excellent energy densities. The Ragone plots dis-
played in Fig. 34b demonstrate the ultrahigh-power performance
of the films in both organic and aqueous electrolytes. A very
high power density of about 500 kW kg(cid:1)1 was achieved with
high energy density of 26 W h kg(cid:1)1 (specific capacitance of
120 F g(cid:1)1 at the current density of 10 A g(cid:1)1).

PAn alternative and effective route to prepare conducting polyani-
line (PANI)-grafted rGO composites with highly enhanced properties
was reported by Kumar et al. [417]. The inclusion of PANI improved
the electrochemical performance of rGO SCs electrodes, with the
devices exhibiting a specific capacitance value of 250 F g¡1. Pedr(cid:1)os
et al. [418] developed 3D hierarchical porous composite structure
via controlled electro-deposition of PANI nanofiber sponge (PANI-
NFS) that fills the pores of a CVD grown GF for the application of SCs.
The PANI-NFS/GF composite synergies the efficient electronic trans-
port in the GF scaffold with the rapid diffusion of the electrolyte ions
into the high-specific surface-area and densely-packed PANI-NFS.
PANI-NFS/GF composite electrodes showed specific and volumetric
capacitances (at a current density of 0.31 A g¡1) of 968 F g¡1 and
86 F cm¡3, respectively. The as synthesized PANI-NFS/GF composite
exhibited retention of 83% after 15,000 cycles at a current density of
28 mA cm¡2.

PHierarchical structured electrodes with nanoacanthine-style
PANI deposited onto a carbon nanofiber/ GO (PANI/CNF/GO) tem-
plates were prepared by Xu et al. [419] via an in situ polymerization
process. The high electrical conductivity and flexibility, in combina-
tion with the hierarchical architecture, suggest that free-standing
PANI/CNF/GO hybrid porous electrodes have significant potential as
electrode materials for lightweight and flexible energy storage devi-
ces with stable high performance. The hierarchical free-standing
electrodes showed a specific capacitance of 450.2 F g¡1 at the voltage
scan rate of 10 mV s¡1. Xu et al. [420] prepared GO/PANI nanocom-
posites by in situ polymerization with the assistance of supercritical

Pcarbon dioxide. The GO/PANI nanocomposites exhibit better specific
capacitance and cycling stability than pure PANI and GO, owing to
synergistic effects. The SCs made with the promising material exhib-
ited high specific capacitance (425 F g¡1) at a current density of
0.2 A g¡1, as shown in Fig. 35a. A ternary nanocomposite system,
composed of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), NH2-treated gra-
phene nanodots (GND), and rGO, was synthesized by Cho et al.
[421]. The SCs made with the resulting PVDF/NH2 treated GND/rGO
nanocomposites exhibited higher dielectric constant (e0 (cid:5) 60.6) and
larger energy density (Ue(cid:5) 14.1 J cm¡3) when compared to pristine
PVDF (e0 (cid:5) 11.6 and Ue(cid:5) 1.8 J cm¡3). An ultrathin SCs electrode was
fabricated by solution-processed assembly of rGO nanosheets with a
photo-crosslinked polymer by Jo et al. [422]. UV treatment triggered
cross-linking of a diazoresin with PEDOT: PSS, causing pure electro-
static interactions to be converted into covalent bonds. The SCs fab-
ricated with the hybrid rGO thin films exhibited a capacitance of
354 F cm¡3 (scan rate of 20 mV s¡1) and maintained a capacitance of
300 F cm¡3 even at the high scan rate of 200 mV s¡1 in 1.0 M H2SO4
electrolyte as shown in Fig. 35b.

PXing et al. [423] reported a facile photochemical reduction
method for producing graphene hydrogels with 3D porous struc-
tures from GO suspensions. The SCs based on this material showed
good stability and high reversibility in the charge/discharge cycling
tests. They exhibited high specific capacitance (254 F g¡1 at 1 A g¡1)
in KOH electrolyte and 64% of this value was maintained after
increasing the discharging current density to 4 A g(cid:1)1. Kumar et al.
[299] reported the electrochemical performance of 3D structures

Pcomprised of hierarchically stacked Co3O4 nanobeads, 1D CNTs and
2D graphene. The electrodes based on this interesting hierarchical
structure allowed the fabrication of devices with a maximum spe-
cific capacitance of 600 F g¡1 at the charge/discharge current density
of 0.7 A g¡1 in KOH electrolyte. Three-dimensional rGO/Ni foam
composites were prepared by Yang et al. [424] by low temperature
reduction of GO by Ni foam in a pH 2 aqueous suspension over long
periods of time. The rGO/Ni foam composite reduced for 5 h showed
an areal capacitance of 206.7 mF cm¡2 at 0.5 mA cm¡2 and good rate
performance and cycling stability, with areal capacitance retention
of 97.4% after 10,000 cycles at 3 mA cm¡2. Further extending the
reduction time to 9 h at 70 °C, the composite showed an areal capaci-
tance of 323 mF cm¡2 at 0.5 mA cm¡2. Li et al. [425] prepared hierar-
chical flower-like NiO/rGO composites for hybrid SCs which
exhibited good stability and retained 90% of their initial capacitance
even after 5000 cycles. Fig. 36a shows the maximum specific
capacitance in a 6.0 M KOH electrolyte, which was found to be
»428 F g¡1 at a discharge current density of 0.38 A g¡1. Hsieh et al.
[426] reported high specific capacitance, superior rate capability,
and excellent cyclic stability of rGO nanosheets decorated with SnO2
nanocrystals as electrode materials for electrochemical capacitors.
Fig. 36b shows the specific capacitance as a function of current den-
sity for electrochemical capacitors fabricated with the SnO2/rGO
composites. The nanocomposites are designated rGS1, rGS2, and
rGS3, having SnO2/rGO weight ratios of 1/4, 1/2, and 1/1, respec-
tively. Specific capacitance reached 348 F g¡1 (for rGS1) at a current
density of 50 mA g¡1, showing an increase of up to 98% in compari-
son with the values obtained with a pristine rGO electrode.

PPatterned microscale features have also been achieved by using a
KrF excimer laser (λ = 248 nm) to reduce graphite oxide into multi-
layer graphene in both vacuum and N2 [318]. The DLW technique on
graphite oxide films shows obvious advantages for manufacturing
[427, 428]. The DLW on hydrated graphite oxide films was used to
form rGO electrodes for SCs [428]. Different micro-patterns were
designed and fabricated by scanning the samples with a CO2 laser
printer (Power: 2.4 W). The untreated GO region between the pat-
terned rGO electrodes served both as an electrolyte and an electrode
separator due to OH and epoxy groups present in this region, which
makes GO to simultaneously behave as a good ionic conductor and
an electronic insulator.

PThe incidence of laser beams on polyimide sheets can transform
them into graphitic carbon materials and the patterning in the form
of electrodes can be used for SCs applications. Tour and his group
[429(cid:1)432] demonstrated the conversion of polyimide films into
porous graphene for the fabrication of flexible SCs employing a com-
puter-controlled CO2 infrared laser system (Universal X-660 laser

Pcutter platform). Lin et al. [431] also reported laser-induced forma-
tion of porous graphene films from commercial polymers for SCs
application. The converted polyimide films have high electrical con-
ductivity and can be readily patterned to form interdigitated electro-
des for in-plane SCs.

PThe micro SC (MSC) devices are promising for future electronics,
due to their small size, fast power delivery, long cycle life and capa-
bility of on-chip integration [433(cid:1)435]. MSCs as single devices
enable effective integration of large-scale MSC arrays to attain excel-
lent collective electrochemical performance. Full-inkjet-printing
techniques are utilized for the scalable fabrication of graphene-
based MSCs on various substrates [436]. High performance graphene
inks were formulated by integrating electrochemically exfoliated
grapheme and used to reliably print graphene interdigitated electro-
des with tunable geometry and thickness. This adopted approach
increases the areal capacitance of printed all-solid-state grapheme
electrode. Along with the printed polyelectrolyte, poly(4-styrenesul-
fonic acid), the fully printed graphene-based MSCs achieved the
maximum areal capacitance of » 0.7 mF cm¡2. In a different research
group, MSCs via standard microfabrication technology were fabri-
cated on graphene nanowalls (GNWs) supported on a Ni thin-layer
(GNW/Ni) heterostructures [437]. The fabricated MSCs have high
rate capability, large specific energy density (2.1 mWh cm¡3) and
high power density up to 5.91 W cm¡3 was attributed to an efficient
harnessing of the properties of GNW as well as Ni-based active
materials. Applying another approach, interdigitated MSCs were fab-
ricated by laser writing using Co-MOF (ZIF-67) on a polyimide sub-
strate [164]. The as fabricated MSC devices exhibited ultrahigh
cycling stability up to 2 £ 105 cycles as well as 98% capacitance
retention at a 150° bending angle.

PVertically grown aligned 3D epitaxial GNWs on flexible carbon
cloths (CCs) via a microwave plasma-enhanced CVD method were
demonstrated [438]. Nitrogen doping was achieved by introducing
in situ NH3 plasma to form N-doped GNWs (NGNWs). The NGNW
SCs exhibited an excellent specific capacitance of 991.6 F g¡1, an
apparent area-normalized capacitance of 1488.9 mF cm¡2 and an
energy density of 275.4 Wh kg¡1 at a power density of 14.8 kW kg¡1.
Vertically grown GNW and NGNW without using binder were also
fabricated for application as electrodes of MSCs [439]. The upper
potential limit of a positive electrode of EDLCs was increased from
0.1 to 1.5 V (vs Ag/AgNO3) and the lower potential limit of a negative
electrode were changed from ¡ 2.0 V to ¡ 2.5 V in 1 M TEABF4/PC.
This asymmetrically designed EDLC exhibits a cell voltage of 4 V,
specific energy of 52 Wh kg¡1 (energy density of 13 Wh kg¡1),
specific power of 8 kW kg¡1 and 100% retention after 10,000
charge(cid:1)discharge cycles.

4.2. Lithium ion/sulfur batteries

PLIBs as high energy density storage devices have dominated the
market for energy storage due to its huge demand for portable prod-
ucts such as cell phones, tablets, laptops, cameras and power tools.
They also show immense performance potential in electric vehicle
prototypes which are becoming popular as a means for reducing
environmental pollution. A LIB contains three major components
(anode, cathode, and electrolyte) and converts chemical potential
into electrical energy via Faradaic reactions. During the charging
process, Li ions are extracted from the cathode material and inserted
into the anode via migration through the electrolyte, while electrons
flow in the external circuit from the cathode to the anode. Due to its
excellent physical and chemical properties, graphene has been
widely used as electrode material in lithium ion batteries. Gra-
phene/rGO with metal/metal oxide NPs, provide additional alloying,
insertion and conversion reactions with Li+, leading to enhanced
charge storage capacity [440].

PGraphene materials with metal NPs have been proposed as anode
materials in LIBs [425,441(cid:1)445]. Few layer rGO was utilized as an
electrode material in LIBs, displaying a 346 mAh g¡1 capacity at a
charge/discharge current density of 1C, even after 60 cycles, which is
comparable to the theoretical capacity of graphite (372 mAh g¡1).
The rGO was synthesized from a GO suspension using ethylenedi-
amine as a reducing agent and a cross-linker [446]. A three layer-
structured hybrid nanostructure consisting of TiO2 NPs sandwiched
between PANI and GNSs enabled fast charge/discharge battery oper-
ation when compared to TiO2, as reported by Zhang et al. [51]. The
nanocomposites enabled a discharge capacity of 149.8 mAh/g with
a Coulombic efficiency of 99.19% at a current density of 5 C
(1C = 1675 mA g¡1). Wang et al. [447] reported the application of Si-
carbon nanocables sandwiched between rGO sheets (SiNW@G@rGO)
as an anode material for LIBs. The morphology of the material pre-
vents the direct exposure of the encapsulated Si nanowires to the
electrolyte, ensuring structural and interfacial stabilization. This
electrode enabled LIBs with a reversible specific capacity of
1600 mAh g¡1 at 2.1 A g¡1, 80% capacity retention after 100 cycles
and superior rate capability (500 mAh g¡1 at 8.4 A g¡1).

PGao et al. [448] reported the fabrication and testing of multi-lay-
ered Si-rGO electrodes displaying stable charge(cid:1)discharge perfor-
mance at high rates. A reversible capacity of 2787 mAh g¡1 (at the
rate of 100 mA g¡1) and a stable capacity over 1000 mAh g¡1 (at
1 A g¡1) were retained after 50 cycles, with a coulombic efficiency of
99% during the whole cycling process. An architecture of rolled-up
Si/rGO bi-layer nanomembranes was utilized in anodes for LIBs by
Liu et al. [449]. They demonstrated a long life of 2000 cycles at
3 A g¡1 with a capacity degradation of only 3.3% after 100 cycles.
Electrochemically sTable 3D Si-CNT/rGO nano-heterostructures
were also synthesized for anodes in LIBs [450]. In the heterostruc-
ture, Si NPs offer high capacity, CNTs act as a mechanical/ electrically
conductive support to connect Si NPs, and rGO provides a matrix
with void spaces to accommodate the volume changes of Si NPs
upon lithiation/ delithiation. High reversible initial capacity of
1665 mAh g¡1 and stable cycling performance over 500 cycles with
an average capacity decay of 0.02% per cycle was achieved. The Si-
CNT/rGO electrodes also showed a high-rate capability with
755 mAh g¡1(45.3% retention) at 10 C (16.2 A g¡1).

PA Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) sheath over SnO2 hollow
spheres/GO (SnO2 HS/GO/PEDOT) hybrid behaved as high perfor-
mance anode in LIBs [451]. According to the authors, the hybrid
material showed an excellent rate capability, as a capacity of
381 mAh g¡1 was attained at a current density of 2 A g¡1. GNS-SnO2
composites were synthesized using hydrothermal and electron-
beam irradiation (EBI) strategies where SnO2 quantum dots were
supported on GNSs [452]. The 210 kGy irradiated GNS-SnO2 and
unirradiated GNS-SnO2 electrodes maintained reversible capacities

Pof 932.4 and 655.9 mAh g¡1, respectively, after 30 cycles at 5 C and
shows excellent cycle response, high specific capacity, and high
reversible capacity for a LIB.

PFlexible spinel-type oxide/ rGO composite aerogels as binder-free
anodes for Li ion batteries, where the spinel (MFe2O4; MHCo, Mn, Ni)
NPs were integrated in an interconnected rGO network were fabri-
cated [453]. The as-synthesized spinel/rGO composite aerogels dem-
onstrated enhanced rate capability and long-term stability without
capacity fading after 1000 cycles (4.5 A g¡1) in the case of CoFe2O4.
Yao et al. [454] reported self-assembled CoMoO4 NPs anchored on
rGO enhanced the specific capacity of LIBs anodes, reaching up to
920 mAh g¡1 at a current rate of 74 mA g¡1. The half cells displayed
impressive cycling stability, with 8.7% capacity loss after 600 cycles
under a current density of 740 mA g¡1.

PCoO hollow cube/rGO composites enhanced the charge stor-
age capability of LIBs. A value of 1170 mAh g¡1 at a current den-
sity of 150 mA g¡1 has been reported, as shown in Fig. 37a. This
performance is much better than the one obtained with rGO-free
hollow CoO nanocubes [455]. Zeng et al. [453] presented a sim-
ple approach to fabricate flexible spinel-type metal oxide/rGO
composite aerogels as binder-free anodes for LIBs. In the case of
CoFe2O4, the composite enhanced the rate capability and long-
term stability after 1000 charge/discharge cycles at 4.5 A g¡1, as
shown in Fig. 37b.

PZhu et al. [456] have used microwave processing in order to
obtain rGO platelets decorated with Fe2O3 NPs and applied the
resulting material as anodes in LIBs. The material enabled charge
and discharge capacities of 1227 and 1693 mAh g¡1, respectively.
Fe2O3/rGO nanocomposites were synthesized using direct self-
assembly of oppositely charged Fe2O3 NPs and GO sheets using a
hydrothermal reduction process without any surfactants or chemical
linkers [457]. The synthesized Fe2O3/rGO nanocomposite shows out-
standing electrochemical performance as an anode material for LIBs.
It shows a high reversible specific capacity of 600 mAh g¡1 (at
0.1 A g¡1), superior rate performance (180 mAh g¡1 at 10 A g¡1 for
300 cycles) and long cycling stability (more than 550 cycles).

PHydrogen-enriched rGO as an anode for LIBs yields an enhanced
electrochemical performance, as reported by Yoon et al. [458]. Bat-
teries incorporating the material showed high reversible capacity
(1331 mAh g¡1 at 50 mA g¡1 after 100 cycles), excellent rate-perfor-
mance (328 mAh g¡1 at 5 A g¡1), and good cycling stability up to
1000 cycles (at a current density of 10 A g¡1) [458]. Ge NPs encapsu-
lated in N-doped rGO through a PVP-assisted hydrolysis method
were utilized as an anode material for LIBs by Xu et al. [419]. With
the Ge/rGO composite a discharge capacity of 1475 mAh g¡1 and a
reversible capacity of 700 mAh g¡1 after 200 cycles at a current den-
sity of 0.5 A g¡1 were achieved. Moreover, Ge/rGO showed a capacity
of 210 mAh g¡1 even at a high current density of 10 A g¡1.

PSeveral other rGO-based composites show good potential as
anode materials for LIBs. Some of the examples are: crumpled rGO/
MoS2 nanoflowers [459], CuS nanowires/rGO [460], hollow nanobar-
rels of a-Fe2O3 on rGO [461], amorphous GeOx-coated rGO balls
[462], Si/Ti2O3/rGO [463], fluorine-doped tin oxide nanocrystal/rGO
[464], MnS hollow microspheres-rGO [465], hierarchical rGO-
Co2V2O7 nanosheets [466] and copper silicate hydrate hollow
spheres-rGO [467]. Graphene-based composites have also been used
as cathode materials for LIBs applications. Guo et al. [468] prepared
a GO/LiFeSO4F composite which served as a cathode material with
improved cycle stability and rate capability in LIBs. This unique
structure forms an effective conducting network, facilitating the
charge transfer reactions at the electrode/electrolyte interface and
improving the lithium diffusion in the electrode bulk. The authors
achieved a discharge capacity of 113.2 mAh g¡1 at the 0.1C rate with
99% capacity retention after 100 cycles. The batteries were able to
deliver 85.1, 73.4, and 30.3 mAh g¡1 at the high current rates of 1C,
2C, and 10C, respectively.

PLithium(cid:1)sulfur (Li(cid:1)S) batteries hold great promise for next gen-
eration high density energy storage, however, the shuttle of polysul-
fide induces rapid capacity degradation and poor cycling in these
cells. The loss of sulfur cathode material causes significant capacity
fading in rechargeable lithium/sulfur cells. By incorporating gra-
phene/rGO, the performance of Li-S batteries was enhanced, because
it can be wrapped around sulfur by the solution ionic strength
[469,470]. In ionic solutions, the graphene/rGO crumples to mini-
mize its surface energy which wraps the particles in the process and
forms a core-shell structure [471].

PAmylopectin-wrapped GO-sulfur composites were prepared by
Zhou et al. [472] in order to build a 3-dimensionally cross-linked
structure through the interaction between amylopectin and GO for
stabilizing the performance of Li(cid:1)S batteries. Li(cid:1)S battery cathode
materials were synthesized by applying a coating of GO on S, Si and
C particles in suspension through manipulation of the ionic strength
of solutions. Wang et al. [473] developed a flexible slurry-less nano-
Li2S/rGO cathode paper which was directly used as a free-standing
and binder-free cathode without metal substrate showing an excel-
lent rate capability and cycle life. Ji et al. [474] used a chemical
approach to immobilize sulfur species via the reactive functional
groups on GO. The strong interaction between GO and sulfur or poly-
sulfides enabled Li(cid:1)S cells with a reversible capacity of 950(cid:1)1400
mAh g¡1, and stable cycling for more than 50 deep cycles at 0.1C as
shown in Fig. 38a. Hwa et al. [475] reported the use of lithium sul-
fide/GO nanospheres with conformal carbon coating ( Li2S/GO@C) as
a high-rate, long-life cathode for Li(cid:1)S batteries. The Li2S/GO@C cath-
ode exhibited high initial discharge capacity (650 mAh g¡1 of Li2S)
with a decay rate of 0.046% per cycle. The authors also observed a
high Coulombic efficiency of up to 99.7% for 1500 cycles at the dis-
charge rate of 2C as shown in Fig. 38b [475].

PHuang et al. [476] proposed a unique Li-S battery configuration
with a permselective ultrathin GO membrane for high stability. By
the incorporation of the membrane, the decay rate during cyclic
capacity testing was reduced from 0.49 to 0.23% per cycle. The GO
membrane blocks the diffusion of polysulfides, being also advanta-
geous for decreasing battery self-discharge [476].

4.3. Fuel cells

PFuel cells are devices that convert chemical energy to electrical
energy through the oxidation of a fuel with the aid of catalysts
immobilized on the electrodes [400,477(cid:1)479]. They show great
promise due to their high-efficiency and clean energy conversion.
They differ from batteries in requiring a continuous source of fuel
and oxygen to sustain the chemical reactions. There are several types
of fuel cells, but all of them consist of an anode, a cathode, and an
electrolyte that allows positively charged hydrogen ions (protons) to
move between the two electrodes. Fuel cells have important applica-
tions due to their high energy and power density, high energy con-
version efficiency and low operational temperature [405,480]. The
performance of a fuel cell is strongly dependent on the electrode
materials. Platinum and its alloys show excellent performance as
catalysts in high efficiency fuel cells but the high cost of Pt severely
limits its practical application. In this context, graphene has started
a new generation of catalyst supports with ultra-high surface area,
excellent electrical conductivity, good chemical and environmental
stability and strong coupling with many catalytic NPs.

PKou et al. [481] assessed the specific surface area, electrocatalytic
activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and stability of Pt NPs
supported on functionalized GSs. The material showed high surface
area and ORR activity with excellent stability after 5000 voltamme-
try cycles. The improved properties were attributed to the smaller
aggregation of Pt particles immobilized on graphene [481]. Liu et al.
[482] reported a green electrochemical approach for producing Pt/
graphene composites which have good prospect for application in
various systems, including fuel cells and nanoelectronic devices. Guo
et al. [483] investigated the synthesis of 3D Pt-on-Pd nanodendrites
supported on GNSs and their catalytic activity in CH3OH oxidation.
The current density from the oxidation catalyzed by this bimetallic
composite was about 3(cid:1)9.5 times higher than that of Pt black or
commercial E-TEK Pt/C catalysts as shown in Fig. 39.

Pstrongly enhanced the oxidation efficiencies for both CH3OH and
C2H5OH (Fig. 40). The incorporation of Ru reduced the adsorption of
CO-like carbonaceous species on the surfaces of Pt particles.

PQu et al. [46] reported the CVD synthesis of N-doped graphene
using CH4 and NH3. This N-doped graphene was used as a metal-free
electrode in alkaline fuel cells. Much better electrocatalytic activity,
long-term operation stability, and tolerance to crossover effect than
Pt was obtained for ORR via a four-electron pathway [46]. N-doped
graphene synthesized by nitrogen plasma exhibited much higher
electrocatalytic activity toward ORR and H2O2 reduction than gra-
phene. The doped graphene electrodes also presented much higher
durability and selectivity than Pt for oxygen reduction [485]. Zhang
et al. [486] prepared N-doped graphene by heating GO in an ammo-
nia flow at various temperatures (300, 500, 700 and 800 °C). The
loading of Pt NPs on N-doped graphene synthesized at 800 °C
yielded excellent activity towards methanol oxidation due to the

Phigh dispersion of Pt NPs and superior conductivity induced by the
incorporated nitrogen. Imran Jafri et al. [487] investigated N-doped
graphene nanoplatelets as the catalyst support of Pt for ORR. The N-
doped graphene was produced by nitrogen plasma treatment of gra-
phene. Fuel cells with Pt/N-doped graphene and Pt/graphene com-
posite catalysts achieved power densities of 440 and 390 mW cm¡2,
respectively.

PYang et al. [488] prepared S-doped graphene which was an effi-
cient metal-free cathode catalyst for ORR. The S-doped graphene
exhibited better catalytic activity than the commercial Pt/C in alka-
line media, indicating once again that doped graphene holds great
potential as an alternative for Pt-based catalysts in fuel cells. Mah-
mood et al. [489] reported hydrothermal synthesis of Co3S4 nano-
tubes on GSs. The composites reacted with dissolved oxygen in the
ORR by four- and two-electron mechanisms in both acidic and basic
media with an onset potential close to that of commercial Pt/C. The
stability of the composites was much higher than that of Pt/C, and
they exhibited high CH3OH tolerance [489].

4.4. Solar cells

PA solar cell, or photovoltaic cell, is an electrical device that con-
verts the energy of sunlight directly into electricity by the photovol-
taic effect. It has been estimated that the solar energy output from
the sun is 3 £ 1024 J year¡1, which is 104 times more than the con-
sumption rate of mankind [490]. Organic photovoltaic (OPV) materi-
als have significant potential for enabling the fabrication of high
power conversion efficiency, mechanically flexible and low cost
solar cells [491(cid:1)496]. Nevertheless, further material development is
still required for the technology to achieve full commercial viability.
In particular, the performance and durability of many current
generation OPV cells are limited by poorly understood interfacial
phenomena. Graphene and rGO have been used as electrodes for
active layers of organic solar cells and for polymer electrolyte mem-
branes of fuel cells [497]. Radich et al. [498] reported the application
of a rGO-Cu2S composite for high-efficiency quantum dot solar cells.

Pusing the optimized rGO-Cu2S composite counter electrode exhib-
ited a high power conversion efficiency of 4.4%. The utilization of GO
thin films as the hole transport and electron blocking layer in OPV
cell was demonstrated by Li et al. [499]. The incorporation of GO
deposited from neutral solutions between the photoactive poly(3-
hexylthiophene)
(P3HT): phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester
(PCBM) layer and the transparent and conducting indium tin oxide
led to decreases in electron-hole recombination and leakage current.
This resulted in a dramatic increase in the OPV efficiencies up to val-
ues that are comparable to devices fabricated with PEDOT: PSS as
the hole transport layer.

PDye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are attractive due to their low
cost production, easy fabrication, and relatively high energy conver-
sion efficiency. Generally, DSSCs are composed of a dye, a working
electrode, a counter electrode and an electrolyte [500]. Kavan et al.
[501] used optically transparent cathodes for Co(iii/ii)-mediated
DSSC based on GO. Thin semitransparent films were fabricated on F-
doped SnO2 (FTO) from single layer GO either pure or in a composite
with graphene nanoplatelets. The electrochemical performance of
GO improved prominently upon chemical reduction with hydrazine
and/or heat
treatment. The high electrocatalytic activity and
enhanced stability of GO-containing films is beneficial for applica-
3+/2+ as the redox shuttle as shown
tion in DSSC employing Co(bpy)3
in Fig. 41a(cid:1)d [501]. Han et al. [502] reported the fabrication of mes-
o-structured perovskite solar cells based on a rGO/mesoporous-TiO2

Pnanocomposite that showed improved electron transport properties
owing to the reduced interfacial resistance. This effect significantly
increased the short circuit current density and open circuit voltage.
The nanocomposite film with an optimal rGO content of 0.4 vol%
shows 18% higher photon conversion efficiency then solar cells
based on TiO2 NPs as shown in Fig. 41e [502].

PMurray et al. [503] demonstrated the use of electronically tuned
GO as an effective interfacial layer (IFL) for templating the optimum
donor polymer p-stacking orientation for high efficiency OPVs. In
addition to functioning as a solution-processable PEDOT: PSS alter-
native, GO significantly enhances the durability of fully fabricated
devices by increasing the active layer-IFL interfacial stability under
thermal and environmental stress [503]. Electrodes for flexible OPV
cells by in-situ photoreduction of spin-coated GO using femtosecond
laser (λ = 800 nm) have been reported by Kymakis et al. [504]. The
thin films from GO suspensions in ethanol were deposited onto flexi-
ble PET substrates. The technique does not require transfer of the
reduced graphene film onto the PET substrate.

PVarious other types of counter electrodes incorporating rGO have
been also tested in an effort to improve the overall performance and
efficiency of solar cells. Some of the exemples are: rGO-TaON com-
posites [505], MWCNTs@rGO nano ribbons [506], TiO2 photo-anodes
with nitrogen-rGO [507], rapid atmospheric pressure plasma jet
processed rGO [508], nanocomposite of tin sulfide NPs with rGO
[509] and GO-anatase TiO2 nanosheets [510].

PBy using a focused laser beam as a localized energy source, laser
induced CVD allows simultaneous synthesis as well as device pat-
terning. The very short processing times as compared to the conven-
tional CVD, results in less consumption of energy and raw materials.
Another benefit is the possibility to use heat-sensitive substrates
(like polymers, for example) because the synthesis can be performed
at low temperatures (even at room temperature in some cases). The
method also allows more flexibility in the selection of precursors
and better control over the number of graphene layers on the final
product. On the other hand, the initial investment to implement the
technology is quite high and the method is not satisfactory when
large area synthesis is required. Even when using ultraviolet lasers,
there are intrinsic optical limitations for obtaining graphene devices
with features much smaller than a micron, so the technique is not
suitable for nanoscale work. However, this technique is well suited
for fabrication of flexible energy devices like supercapacitors, where
the lateral dimensions of features are relatively large (dozens of
microns). It is also important to emphasize that applications in
energy usually do not require the highest crystallinity of GSs, as the
electrochemically active nanomaterials must have high surface area
and nanoscale porosity.

PMany other methods among those referenced in this review
exhibit very favorable characteristics for synthesis of graphene in
various forms, and their use in research is determined by multiple
factors including previous experience of the researcher, available
infrastructure and production cost. Thermal/chemical methods are
particularly attractive as they are cheap and can be used to synthe-
size large amounts of graphene flakes of variable sizes and quality.
These methods can also be used for synthesis of graphene hybrids
with other electroactive components like metal oxides, metal sul-
fates and conductive polymers. The use of these components also
helps to create stable 3D architectures and reduce the restacking of
GSs due to strong van der Waals interaction between them, resulting
in partial loss of device capacitance. On the other hand, these
approaches are not capable of directly generating films or devices,
since the synthesis is just a first step and further steps like layer
assembly and device patterning demand other suitable strategies.

PMicrowave processing shares most of the characteristics of other
thermal/chemical methods, but provides advantages in terms of
lower energy consumption, possibility to achieve very high tempera-
tures in a short time and in a controlled way, thus providing tighter
control over the level of GO reduction, as well as a wider variety of
possible product morphologies. The method is very simple and con-
venient for obtaining rGO hybrid materials, but is limited to the syn-
thesis of rGO flakes for further processing and manipulation in order
to generate more device-appropriate forms.

PThe localized rGO conversion taking place in the GO regions illu-
minated by a laser beam focused in a tiny spot has been developed
as an alternative technique for direct device patterning at room tem-
perature. High purity rGO lines formed by scanning the laser beam
on GO films with low power consumption and control over the
degree of GO reduction are easily obtained by adopting this
approach. Compared to the other methods, laser reduction may
demand a higher initial investment, but in the long term the running
costs are quite low. The method is clearly oriented for direct pattern-
ing in spatially limited areas, but it may also be applied to continu-
ous large area films, although this can only be achieved with long
time consumption. Powder conversion might also be achieved by
laser reduction performed in aqueous GO suspensions, especially for
smaller amounts of material.

PConsidering the applications of graphene/rGO in electrochemical
energy conversion and storage devices, the important point is that
most devices have an essentially 3D arquitecture, so that the meth-
ods of localized processing are not easily applicable, with an excep-
tion in the case of supercapacitors. For these devices, especially
when fabricated in a planar configuration, an increasing trend

5. Conclusions and future perspectives

PThe synthesis of graphene/rGO, their manipulation/modification
and the large number of applications have attracted enormous
attention from the scientific community working in the interdisci-
plinary area of material science. Keeping this intense interest in
view, we have systematically reviewed herein the recent progress
on the synthesis and modification of carbon-based 2D materials.
Graphene synthesis has been reported by various methods and each
have their own advantages in terms of product morphology/micro-
structure, properties and yield. Depending on the interest and moti-
specific techniques are adopted.
vation of each researcher,
Sometimes the goal is to acquire a better understanding of the
parameters controlling the growth and their effect on the properties
of the final product. On the other hand, shifting to a new methodol-
ogy could be attractive due to the recognition that the new approach
may bring unique advantages in terms of cost, ease of fabrication or
material properties.

PNowadays, CVD is the most widely used synthesis strategy in
many laboratories as well as in the industries involved in the fabrica-
tion of electronic devices. Thermal CVD exhibits various advantages
for thin film deposition, including the fabrication of graphene films
of high quality, low-defect density and large area. Besides the initial
cost for implementation of the technique, CVD processing is time-
consuming, uses large amounts of high purity gases and demands
like plasma-
high energy input. Some variants of the method,
enhanced CVD, have helped to lower the processing temperatures,
but precise control over the quality and the number of graphene
layers across large areas remains still a challenge and the technique
is appropriate for depositing films only, not for the direct device
fabrication.

Ptowards the adoption of DLW methods can be detected. This ten-
dency has emerged from the architecture of 2D SCs, which is funda-
mentally different from the other devices due to the inherent need
for layer structuring.

PThe investigations in graphene based hybrid materials have dem-
onstrated great progress since last decade and hold great promise
for numerous applications in novel energy conversion and storage
devices, perfectly meeting the requirements of lightweight, flexible,
bendable electrodes. The use of 3D structures based on 2D GSs and
their hybrids with electrochemically active materials is a very prom-
ising way to develop compact, lightweight and efficient energy stor-
age devices for emerging wearable and portable electronics. Such
structures have high potential in achieving tunable pore size and
structures, large specific surface areas, fast mass and charge trans-
port. However, the mechanisms of formation of these 3D structures
are still not well understood and further optimization of fabrication
technologies, along with development of specific characterization
techniques and methods require new research efforts and thorough
investigation. It is also very important to develop a deeper under-
standing of the surface chemistry of graphene and its derivatives/
hybrids, and the energy storage mechanisms. In particular, the inter-
facial reactions between the electrodes and electrolytes are still a
subject under intense study. It is also fundamental to develop an
adequate assembly strategy that is able to avoid the restacking of
GSs in the assembly processes in order to achieve stable macroscopic
graphene-based materials on a large scale.

PMany other challenging issues still remain unresolved, including
controllable preparation of graphene-based materials with desired
quality, size distribution of flakes, conductivity, porosity, defect
engineering, high specific surface area and electrochemical activity
at low cost and high yield. Another important issue is the develop-
ment of new approaches to create various hybrid nanostructures
and specially designed 3D hybrid architectures rather than the ran-
dom mixtures of 2D, 1D and 0D nanomaterials with specific func-
tionalities using graphene or rGO sheets as main building blocks to
achieve high volumetric capacity and stable performance of energy
storage devices. Finally, properly addressing these issues, we can
expect numerous revolutionary changes in basic research, novel
industrial applications, and our daily life in the near future.
