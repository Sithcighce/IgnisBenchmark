Since its discovery, the Flameless Combustion (FC) regime has been seen as a promising alternative combus-
tion technique to reduce pollutant emissions of gas turbine engines. This combustion mode is often charac-
terized by well-distributed reaction zones, which can potentially decrease temperature gradients, acoustic
oscillations and, consequently NOx emission. However, the application of FC to gas turbines is still not a real-
ity due to the inherent difficulties faced in attaining the regime while meeting all the engine requirements.
Over the past years, investigations related to FC have been focused on understanding the fundamentals of
this combustion regime, the regime boundaries,
its computational modelling, and combustor design
attempts. This article reviews the progress achieved so far, discusses the various definitions of the FC regime,
and attempts to point the directions for future research. The review suggests that modelling of the FC regime
is still not capable of predicting intermediate species and pollutant emissions. Comprehensive experimental
databases with conditions relevant to gas turbine combustors are not available, and moreover, many of the
current experiments do not necessarily represent the FC regime. By analysing the latest developments in
computational modelling, the review points to the most promising approaches for the prediction of reaction
zones and pollutant emissions in FC. The lessons learned from previous design attempts provide valuable
insights into the design of a successful gas turbine engine operating under the FC regime. The review con-
cludes with some examples where the gas turbine architecture has been exploited to advance the possibili-
ties of FC in gas turbines.

1. Introduction

The manufacture of stone tools and manipulation of fire are the
most important extrasomatic milestones in our early evolutionary tra-
jectory. Hominids learned to make fire and use it for beneficial pur-
poses more than a million years ago [1]. Thus, combustion technology
is the second oldest technology of human kind. However, it was only
in the 19th century, during the industrial revolution that combustion
was looked into scientifically. The energy harness through the combus-
tion process made the modern civilization possible.

Even though the advances in combustion sciences made in the
20th century were phenomenal with the progress in experimental
techniques and numerical modelling, we still do not understand
every aspect of combustion. The advances in combustion in the
21st century will be driven by fuel flexibility and emission reduc-
tion, due to increase in the “energy mix” and a strong drive to
reduce emissions.

Gas turbines play an important role, both in the transport and
energy sector. Thus in order to reduce global warming and to make
our environment more sustainable, it is important that the emissions
from gas turbines are reduced substantially.

Even though sustainable energy sources and storage systems are
increasingly becoming more important, alternatives to combustion in
aviation are still underdeveloped and will not become feasible solu-
tions in commercial aircraft for the next decades due to the extremely
low energy density of batteries [2].

The trends and goals in aviation engines are paradoxical in rela-
tion to NOx emissions. Turbine inlet temperatures (TIT) and overall
pressure ratios (OPR) have been increasing over time in the pursuit of
increasing thermal efficiency and thereby reducing the fuel consump-
tion and CO2 emissions [3]. While on the other hand, NOx emissions
have to be reduced, in spite of their tendency to increase with both
TIT and OPR. T.

The data displayed in Fig. 1 shows the trend of increasing OPR
over time and the corresponding NOx emission index. In order to
lower or maintain NOx emissions while increasing OPR and TIT, new
combustion technologies have to be developed. According to the
goals set by the Advisory Council for Aviation Research and Innova-
tion in Europe (ACARE), the NOx emission levels in 2050 should be
only 10% as compared to a baseline aircraft of year 2000 [5].

Pollutant emissions regulations for land-based gas turbines differ
significantly in relation to that of aero engines because of their inter-
action with the systems operating at power plants and the larger vari-
ety in terms of power output, fuels and usage (mechanical drive or
electricity). A summary of existing regulations in different countries
was presented by Klein [6]. Regardless of the differences, the regula-
tory pressures on land-based gas turbines have also been a concern
to designers and operators. Emission regulations for NOx and CO
have been increasingly stringent, while greenhouse gases taxation
and emission trading schemes have already been introduced in some
countries.

Although the current trend in electricity generation is to shift towards
sustainable and renewable energy conversion methods, land-based gas
turbines are far from becoming obsolete. Gas turbines are pointed as one
of the solutions to be employed along with wind or solar [7] energy

systems to deal with the inherent intermittency of these energy sources
[8]. Energy storage in the form of fuels and the decoupling of the com-
pression and expansion cycles of gas turbines with compressed air
energy storage are regarded as feasible approaches in combined cycle
power plants based on wind or solar energy [9].

Consequently, research and development have been focused on
options that minimize the environmental impact of gas turbine com-
bustion while retaining high efficiencies. Broadly, it may be achieved
by using alternative fuels, improving current combustor designs, or
adopting new combustion concepts. The latter is arguably the most
complex alternative but has more potential for providing significant
improvements.

A few approaches have been investigated and attempted as new
combustion concepts for aeronautical gas turbines, such as the Trapped
Vortex Combustor (TVC) and Lean Direct Injection (LDI). However, these
concepts are not likely to be able to meet the ambitious ACARE and
NASA emission reduction goals for aero engines as the pressure ratio
and operating temperatures are being increased in the pursuit of
increasing efficiency. Therefore alternative combustion concepts like
Flameless Combustion (FC) have to be explored. A qualitative compari-
son of different types of combustors with FC is shown in Table 1, in
which the advantages of FC are clear: the well-distributed reactions that
characterise the FC regime often yield low temperature gradients, low
NOx emissions, high stability and low acoustic oscillations. It is worth
pointing out that the level of readiness for application of FC-based com-
bustors is lower than that of the other types, therefore the characteris-
tics stated in Table 1 are based on its potential.

Some of the advantageous characteristics are results of the decou-
pling between fluid dynamics and heat release under the FC regime
[10]. The most attractive feature is the potential for low NOx emissions,
which is a result of three factors that come into play under FC: i)
homogenization of the reaction zones, ii) local reduction of the avail-
ability of the main reactants for NOx formation and iii) alteration of the
NOx formation chemistry, with effects on pathways as NNH, N2O and
prompt, as well as increased NOx reburning. The link between homo-
geneity and lower NOx is well-established [11(cid:1)13], as thermal NOx
formation is reduced if temperatures peaks decrease. The reduction of
the reactants is because FC is attained with lower O2 concentration,
which in the context of gas turbines is often realised by flue-gas recir-
culation, which results in lower N2 as well. The recirculation of com-
bustion products is also responsible for changing the NOx chemistry, as
further discussed in Section 4.2.

A similar situation is found for land-based gas turbines, as the
goals for reduction are also challenging. Additionally, the intermit-
tent and flexible operation required from gas turbines for their
application along with renewable energy sources makes the scenario
even more demanding, as broad operational range is required due to
the fact engines would often have to constantly operate at part-load.
One of the alternatives to achieve stable and efficient part-load oper-
ation is through exhaust gas recirculation (EGR). From the combus-
tion point of view, EGR may be used to achieve FC conditions [14].

Therefore, the FC regime is an opportunity for both aeronautical
and land-based gas turbines. Although FC is already successfully
applied in industrial furnaces, the conditions required to attain the FC
regime are not trivial to be obtained in a gas turbine. The requirement

to preheat the reactants and to lower O2 concentrations present a sig-
nificant challenge for the designers. Limitations in volume, which is
translated into high heat density, as well as strict requirements in
terms of pressure losses and operational range combined with lower
overall equivalence ratios and residence times, impose challenging
barriers to the design.

The present work intends to provide an overview of the current
development concerning FC for gas turbine engines. The goal is to
summarize the lessons learned from previous efforts and to identify
the gaps to be filled by future research.

This paper first reviews the progress made so far towards under-
standing the fundamentals of the FC regime and discusses the differ-
ent definitions of the regime and their consequences. Subsequently,
the fundamental canonical research focused on the understanding of
the phenomena involved are reviewed, followed by a comprehensive
overview of the computational modelling efforts, and finally the
design attempts are presented (Table 6).

2. Definition of flameless combustion

Since its first description, the FC regime received different desig-
nations. This fact is in part related to the absence of a formal and con-
sensual definition of the boundaries of the regime or of the features
that characterize it. Acronyms such as MILD (Moderate or Intense
Low Oxygen Dilution), HiTAC (High Temperature Air Combustion),
HiCOT (High Temperature Combustion Technology), and CDC (Col-
ourless Distributed Combustion) refer to the FC regime or slightly dif-
ferent but overlapping concepts.

Cavaliere and de Joannon [15] tackled the issue of the different
designations in their review paper. They pointed that HiCOT is a
broader concept which comprises of combustion with reactants at
relatively high temperatures. HiTAC was then defined by them as a
subarea of HiCOT, in which only the air was heated up to high tem-
peratures. The authors then defined Mild Combustion (not as the
MILD acronym) as a subset of HiTAC, which could be identified by
two parameters: temperature of reactants and temperature rise due
to the release of combustion energy.

However, Cavaliere and de Joannon [15] acknowledged the possi-
ble differences between FC, CDC and Mild Combustion as a matter of
terminology that could not be fully clarified. As the FC and CDC
denominations are the result of aspects related to the emission of vis-
ible radiation during the combustion process, the authors pointed
that their definition of Mild Combustion could overlap but not neces-
sarily coincide with the FC regime, considering FC to be simply a com-
bustion regime without emission of visible radiation.

The issue is more complex if one considers that FC is often attain-
able using recirculation of exhaust gases, without actual air preheat-
ing (HiTAC); or that having lower luminosity is not necessarily
related to distributed reactions and lower emissions [16]. As will
become clear throughout the present review, the FC regime requires
a precise definition to guide the research on the subject.

Historically, the regime was first described by W€unning and
W€unning [17] and was referred to as Flameless Oxidation (FLOX(cid:1)).
The study was in the context of industrial burners and furnaces. The
authors described the main features and advantages of the regime,
and the definition of the boundaries was based on the furnace tem-
perature and recirculation ratio. According to the authors, the regime
these parameters were above certain
could be attained if

approximate values, which were obtained from their practical experi-
ence in industrial furnaces.

The recirculation of combustion products was a central parameter,
defined by the recirculation ratio. The air was split into two streams,
one injected along with the fuel (primary) and the other directly into
the furnace (secondary). By varying the ratio between primary and
secondary air, the furnace studied by W€unning and W€unning [17]
changed its regime from normal to FLOX. It was observed that
increasing the relative amount of secondary air allowed the reactants
to mix with the combustion products prior to reacting with the fuel.
In other words, the recirculation ratio increased with increasing sec-
ondary air.

Cavaliere and de Joannon [15] proposed the most used definition
for the FC regime. Also referred to as a PSR-like definition [18], such
definition imposes the reactant mixture to be above auto-ignition
temperature at the inlet while the temperature rise due to energy
release has to be lower than the same temperature. The authors
defined auto-ignition temperature in the context of PSRs: the lowest
reactor Tin in which any increment in temperature shifts the system
to the higher branch of the S-shaped curve (Tin vs. final temperature,
in this case). In systems relying on recirculation to preheat the reac-
tants, as usually done for gas turbine combustors aimed to operate in
the FC regime, such definition poses difficulties. Considering the reac-
tants inlet temperature prior to the mixing with vitiated gases is not
sufficient to describe the attainment of the regime, while considering
the reactants and recirculated gases to be perfectly premixed prior to
any reaction is also inaccurate.

Retaining the focus on the application to gas turbines, one of the
most comprehensive definitions was that of Rao and Levy [19]. The
proposed diagram, an improved version of which is shown in Fig. 2,

highlights the roles of Tin, the O2 concentration, and the recirculation
ratio. However, the depicted values are only representative and can
vary significantly depending on the specific application. The diagram
is useful to understand the difficulties in achieving FC in gas turbine
combustors, as the values of recirculation ratio required to achieve
lower O2 concentration are quite high.

Recently, Evans et al. [18] made a distinction between FC (or MILD)
and auto-ignition non-premixed flames by extending the proposition
of Oberlack et al. [20], which was developed for premixed flamelets.
Their definition imposes the S-shaped curve (Da vs. T*) to be mono-
tonic under the FC regime. Therefore, a strong and arguable assump-
tion is made: FC flames do not exhibit auto-ignition and extinction in
their structures. This has serious implications to the Jet-in-Hot-Coflow
(JHC) experiments discussed in the following section of this paper since
most of them would be outside the FC regime (as highlighted by Evans
et al. [18]). Consequently, Evans et al. [18] considered the definition of
Cavaliere and de Joannon [15] to be inaccurate, as it comprehends both
auto-igniting and gradual combustion flames.

A comparison of the aforementioned definitions is shown in Fig. 3.
The calculations are performed for methane combustion using the
Cantera package [21] along with the GRI 3.0 mechanism [22], utilizing
chemical equilibrium (for the PSR-like definition), premixed flamelets
and non-premixed flamelets (for the S-shaped curve definitions). The
considered value for the auto-ignition temperature and the one-step
reaction effective activation energy were 1000 K and 40 kcal/mol,
respectively, as previously assumed [15,18].

The plots for the S-shaped curve definition for premixed flames
are made with an assumption for the non-dimensional heat of com-
bustion introduced by Cavaliere and de Joannon [15] Q* (cid:3) DT/Tin,
while the original formulation defined Q* = (QYFin)/(cpWFTin). As the
criterion for a monotonic S-shaped curve is E* (cid:2) 4[(1 + Q*)/Q*], the
approximation neglects the influence of varying fuel mass fraction
and cp for different F and O2 concentrations at the inlet. Therefore,
the resulting FC region using these approximations is larger than
without it. Moreover, it is worth highlighting that the formulation of
Oberlack et al. [20] is valid only for lean mixtures.

The definition for non-premixed flamelets presents no difference
between different F as the regime is evaluated in relation to the tem-
perature reached at stoichiometry. For low enough F, the PSR defini-
tion [15] is only dependent on Tin, as the temperature increase is low
enough for every O2 concentration considered, as shown when
F = 0.4. The only requirement is then to have Tin above auto-ignition
temperature. For F close to unity, the FC region is smaller, as the
temperature increase is higher, which is also the case for the defini-
tion of Oberlack et al. [20].

All three formulations are ultimately dependent on initial tempera-
ture and temperature rise (once auto-ignition temperature and activa-
tion energy are given). Additionally, their assumptions are at first

glance opposing: on one hand being above auto-ignition temperature
[15], and on the other hand not exhibiting ignition or extinction [18,
20]. However, that is not the case, as the definitions share common
regions. Fundamentally, the assumption of Cavaliere and de Joannon
[15] is that in FC the reactions energy barrier imposed by the activation
energy should be surpassed by the reactants initial temperatures, while
not reaching a final state of very high temperature, defined arbitrarily.
On the other hand, the monotonic S-shaped curve assumption is to
some extent concerned with how the energy release takes place, and
not strictly with the initial and final states. The smooth heat release
imposed by the monotonic S-shaped curve is especially translated into
high Tin and low Zel’ dovich numbers, as well as low fuel concentra-
tions for premixed cases.

On a more fundamental standpoint, the Damk€ohler number (Da)
has been constantly pointed as a good indicator for the FC regime, as
it is has been shown that the interaction between turbulence and
chemistry is strong under the regime. Therefore, values of Da are
likely to be close to unity under the FC regime [23(cid:1)25]. The analyses

performed by Cavaliere and de Joannon [15], referred to by the
authors as being “more suggestive than propositive”, focused largely
on chemistry, while turbulence and its interaction with chemistry
were left out of consideration. Many of their investigations were
based on a Da < < 1 assumption. While such assumption is useful to
simplify the study, most authors defend that the FC regime is funda-
mentally linked to turbulence-chemistry interaction.

The generic definition of Da is the ratio between a flow (or
turbulence) time-scale and a chemical time-scale. The difficulty
dwells on how these time-scales are correctly defined to better
represent the phenomena in FC. Examining the diagrams for con-
ventional premixed (as proposed by Borghi [26] and Peters [27])
and non-premixed [28] flames (Fig. 4), the distributed reactions
regime corresponds to values of Da near unity and high Ka (Kar-
lovitz number), considering the flow time-scale of Da to be the
integral time-scale (DaT).

Industrial applications usually have high Reynolds numbers

Fig. 4. Combustion regime diagrams for premixed flames (left) and for non-premixed flames, based on the diagrams proposed by Borghi [24], Peters [27] and Law [28]. If the FC
regime is considered related to distributed reaction zones, the regions highlighted by the dashed lines are relevant for the regime.

considering Da close to unity, integral-scale Re is dependent only
on the square of Ka, defined as the ratio between the chemical
and the Komolgorov time-scales. To which extent the FC regime
is dependent or affected by the value of Ka is still unknown due
to the difficulties involved in achieving a broad range of condi-
tions experimentally or through DNS. However, the high turbu-
lence intensities normally associated with high Re have been
reported to aid the attainment of the FC regime [29].

From the perspective of gas turbines, combustion is usually placed
on the premixed diagram in the thin reaction zones region, with high
Re, Ka in the vicinity of 100, and Da greater than 1 [30(cid:1)32]. In order to
attain the region where FC is expected to occur, higher values of Ka
and Re are expected, while Da has to drop. One can conclude that the
chemical time-scales have to be increased in relation to the flow time-
scales. The high pressures required in gas turbine combustors make
that particularly difficult, as reactions tend to occur faster with pres-
sure. Therefore, investigations in high-pressure conditions are neces-
sary. However, as shown in Sections 3 and 5, there is a dearth of
experimental investigations in high pressure environment.

As FC is classified as partially-premixed for most applications,
the classical approaches employed for defining the flow and chem-
ical time-scales for premixed flames are not necessarily valid,
while the definition for non-premixed flames is not consensual.
Isaac et al. [33] proposed a method to determine the chemical
time-scale using the Jacobian of the chemical source term based
on Principal Variable Analysis (PVA). As there is no possible valida-
tion for the method, its analysis comprised the application to sim-
ulation results of representative cases described to be in and out
of the FC regime. They employed simulation results based on the
experiments of Dally et al. [34] (discussed in Section 3.1) to repre-
sent FC conditions, while Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) data
of non-premixed jet flames were used for conventional combus-
tion. A range of Da was then calculated by considering the full
range of the turbulence (or mixing) scale between the Kolmogorov
and integral scales. As expected, FC showed results close to unity,
while conventional combustion exhibited higher values of Da for
integral mixing scales.

Similarly, Li et al. [35] compared their proposed method for calculat-
ing chemical time-scales with others present in the literature (including
the aforementioned PVA of Isaac et al. [33]). The input to the evaluations
was a CFD simulation of a CH4 diffusion flame in a hot coflow, which
was expected to operate under the FC regime. The authors’ method pre-
sented Da values closer to unity, while the other methods had lower Da.
However, Da was calculated considering the Kolmogorov scale as the
flow scale, which is one of the many options to define it. Furthermore,
the evaluation relied on many assumptions that eventually arrive at the
starting point: (i) the chosen case was assumed to be representative of

FC; (ii) the CFD modelling was assumed to accurately capture the flame
characteristics; (iii) the methods were compared based on the expected
Da values for FC. Therefore, this work demonstrates well the difficulty
related to defining FC solely based on Da.

The classification of combustion regimes has been disputed for
decades, even when considering the aforementioned regime dia-
grams (Fig. 4), whose predictive value is limited because of the
assumptions involved. More importantly, even canonical laboratory
flames are spread over different regions of the diagrams instead of
occupying a single point, since the conditions vary locally. Given the
complexity involved in FC, perhaps global parameters alone cannot
define its occurrence.

If a new FC definition would be based on Da and Ka numbers, the
FC regime could be perceived as a local property. One could then set a
global threshold or statistically determined value to define whether
the system is under the FC regime. The inconsistencies found in all the
aforementioned classifications are possibly a result of the simplifica-
tions incurred in estimating local characteristics using global parame-
ters, a common and useful practice in many fields.

The importance of having a widely accepted definition goes
beyond classification. As it is shown in the following sections, the
conclusions of flame structure and modelling studies are not neces-
sarily incremental if there is no certainty that the same regime was
studied. Authors constantly disregard part of the previous works
because of the inconsistencies in the classification or definition.

From a purely practical point of view, a definition including the
advantages of the regime would be useful. Whether the reaction zones
exhibit auto-ignition, are well-distributed, or have low visibility is of
little importance if they do not yield lower emissions and acoustic
oscillations. Evidently, a definition based solely on such advantages
would certainly not be precise, as the conditions are not univocally
achieved in combustion systems. However, this discussion is to point
that while the debate on the boundaries of the FC is ongoing and
requires more scientific support, the technological advance can take
place exploiting the advantages provided by the regime.

3. Basic experimental investigations

The study of combustion often relies on measurements of simple
canonical flame configurations, useful in providing an understanding
of the physics involved in the combustion process and to systemati-
cally change the parameters that govern the flame characteristics, as
well as to provide databases for model validation. Conventional com-
bustion experiments of this type usually utilize burner stabilized
flames for premixed cases, and opposing jets or lifted flames for non-
premixed cases. This section is dedicated to reviewing experiments
intended to investigate the FC regime.

3.1. Axisymmetric burners in non-enclosed environment

Researchers often take advantage of bi-dimensional and axisym-
metric flame configurations in order to simplify measurements and
simulations. Non-enclosed flames have been preferred due to the eas-
ier access for diagnostics. The most used approach to create the nec-
essary conditions to achieve FC is to have a jet containing fuel within
a coflow of oxidiser which may be preheated and/or diluted, as
depicted in the example shown in Fig. 5. Usually called as Jet-in-Hot-
Coflow (JHC), this configuration offers several advantages and unique
features. The generation of vitiated gases in the coflow eliminates the
need for aerodynamic recirculation of combustion products, thereby
providing good control over the local composition. By applying low
O2 concentrations in the coflow, it became clear that this type of
experiment could be suitable to reach the FC regime.

JHC setups have many degrees of freedom as there might be sev-
eral variations: fuel and coflow temperatures, ratio between fuel and
coflow velocities, ratio between jet and coflow widths, fuel types,
coflow composition, etc. For this reason, the identification of patterns
and parameters that govern the attainment of the FC regime is still an
open problem to some extent. Additionally, there is no consensus
regarding the attainment of FC in all cases.

The first set of experiments using JHC to investigate FC was per-
formed by Dally et al. [34], using a burner that is often referred to as
the Adelaide burner. The experiments used a mixture of H2 and CH4
as fuel (equal in volume) and explored three different O2 concentra-
tions (3, 6 and 9% in the mass base) in the preheated coflow, while
maintaining temperatures and fuel jet Reynolds numbers. The coflow
contained constant fractions of CO2 and water, while nitrogen con-
centration was varied. Radial profiles of species concentrations and
temperatures were measured in few axial stations with point meas-
urements.The key findings of Dally et al. [34] were mostly related to
consequences due to the decrease in reactivity with decrease in the
O2 concentration: peak temperatures dropped and OH concentrations
were lower (both due to a decrease in its overall quantity and to reac-
tions becoming more distributed). The overall CO and NOx emissions
were reduced, with NO showing distinct formation patterns in axial
locations closer to flame. The case with the lowest O2% presented
higher NO formation at axial stations closer to the inlet when com-
pared to the cases with higher O2%. This fact pointed to the possibility
of having different dominant chemical paths in the FC regime, as well
as to the importance of the chosen diluent, since a different behaviour

could take place if O2 concentration would be decreased by increasing
CO2 or water.

According to the definition proposed by Evans et al. [18], this set
of experiments is the only one to capture the transition from FC to
auto-igniting flame when increasing the O2 concentration in the
coflow. This observation was corroborated to some extent by the
analysis of Parente et al. [37], in which an interesting statistical analy-
sis of the data showed differences in the flame structures between the
cases with 3 and 9% O2.

The work of Medwell et al. [38] employed practically the same
experimental setup of Dally et al. [34] to assess OH and formaldehyde
(CH2O) distributions via LIF (Laser-induced Fluorescence). The compari-
son between the two works is an interesting example showcasing the
multiple variables in such systems. The set of experiments had coflows
with 3 or 9% O2 volumetric concentration, and different fuel jet Rey-
nolds numbers were imposed by changing the fuel mass flow. The two
data sets are not considering the same system configurations, as there
were differences in fuel composition, coflow velocity and temperature.

Nevertheless, important conclusions arose by simultaneously
acquiring temperature and intensities of OH and CH2O. Lower O2
concentrations led to reduced levels of OH and thickening of the
zone where OH is pronounced. Additionally, the high CH2O levels
pointed to a pattern in the reactions path similar to that found in
auto-ignition. The role of the CH2O radical in such conditions was
further evidenced by other studies [39(cid:1)41], which are discussed
later in this review paper.

Medwell et al. [38] also discussed the effect of ambient air entrain-
ment, which often caused local extinction in spite of the higher O2
concentration. The influence of ambient air is a limitation (or compli-
cation) of such experiments and was found to be mostly dependent
on coflow Reynolds number and the ratio between the fuel and
coflow pipe diameters.

In another paper [39], Medwell et al. used the Adelaide burner with
the same measurement techniques to test the effect of changing the
fuel stream composition. Ethylene was used in four conditions: pure,
mixed with H2, diluted with N2, and diluted with air (partially pre-
mixed). The fuel jet Reynolds number was maintained and the coflow
had 3 or 9% of O2. The authors concluded that the flame stabilization
mechanism in such conditions could be fundamentally different from
that present in conventional diffusion flames. They identified a region
with “weak” reaction (marked by the presence of CH2O and low con-
centrations of OH) upstream of the main reaction zone, at a position
that would normally be identified as the lift-off height. This behaviour

is related to the high temperatures of the reactants which cause auto-
ignition in spite of the low O2 concentrations.

The levels of CH2O below the apparent lift-off height were higher in
the case of ethylene premixed with air, as expected, since CH2O is a pos-
sible indicator of premixedness [42]. Interestingly, H2 addition showed
its potential to radically change the behaviour. The CH2O levels were
the lowest when using H2 due to the increase in reactivity.

Further investigating the CH2O formation in the conditions of these
experiments [38], Meldwell et al. [40] performed laminar flame calcu-
lations showing that the molecular transport of O2 to the rich side of
the reaction zone plays an important role. Such transport occurred in
larger proportions for lower O2 concentration in the coflow. Possibly,
the lower reactivity under O2 deficient conditions allows enough time
for the transport of O2 to the fuel side. In turn, the O2 availability regu-
lates the production of CH2O and, consequently, auto-ignition. The rela-
tion between CH2O, auto-ignition, and O2 levels was further explained
when experiments were conducted adding CH2O to the fuel stream of
the Adelaide burner [43]. The reaction zones moved upstream with
increasing CH2O and this effect was more prominent for lower O2 con-
centrations. One example is shown in Fig. 6.

Moreover, the dependence on highly intermittent features became
evident with the study, although these could not be precisely quanti-
fied. It was observed that the presence of O2 in the unburnt region
increased with higher strain rates, which tend to be associated with
large eddies. Therefore, one could expect the interaction between the
largest turbulence scales and chemistry to be crucial.

The experiments using the Adelaide burner revealed important
conclusions regarding stabilization and the overall behaviour of this
JHC system. In parallel investigations, a slightly different configura-
tion was developed by Cabra et al. [44] to study a jet of a H2(cid:1)(cid:1)N2 mix-
ture injected in a hot coflow generated by lean combustion of H2 and
air to achieve a concentration of 14.74% O2, thus much higher than
those in the Adelaide burner. The burner is often referred to as the
Cabra burner or the Dibble burner. The focus, according to the
authors, was to replicate the coupling between chemical kinetics and
turbulence (i.e. Damk€ohler numbers close to one) present in many
applications. The coflow was created with many H2/air lean laminar
flames. Such coflow was shown to provide reasonably uniform fields,
an important criterion for computational modelling.

The jet Re was considerably larger than that used by Dally et al.
[34], as shown in Table 2. The fuel jet was another major difference
between the two experiments, as Cabra et al. [44] employed H2 with
approximately 25% molar fraction in the central jet, with the rest
being N2 (contrasting with the H2(cid:1)(cid:1)CH4 mixture used in the Adelaide
burner). Simultaneous point measurements of temperatures and
major species concentrations were performed, while planar measure-
ments of OH and NO were done using LIF. Assisted by CFD modelling,
the authors advocated that auto-ignition should be the mechanism
responsible for stabilization, while turbulent mixing of products and
reactants could be present, although they were unable to capture
these features experimentally.

As a means of extending the data acquired with the H2/N2 flames,
Cabra et al. [24] performed a complementary study using a CH4/air
mixture jet. As in the previous study, only point measurements were
performed, and therefore the difference between the behaviour of
the two fuels was shown by the larger scatter of the measured quan-
tities in the stabilization region for the CH4 case. In accordance with
what was later exposed by Medwell et al. [39], these results pointed
to a different behaviour of H2 in relation to stabilization. Indications
of this fact were already present in the experiments with Adelaide
burner in which most of the experiments required an addition of H2
to allow stabilization of the flames. Further evidence arose as differ-
ent fuel blends containing H2 showed similar behaviours [45], the sta-
bilization of hydrocarbon JHC flames was shown to be dependent on
stochastic ignition kernels [46], and when the effect of gradual H2
addition was studied [47].

The Cabra burner operating under similar conditions to those of
Cabra et al. [44] was used by Wu et al. [48] with the objective of gath-
ering data on the velocity fields. They employed LDV to measure
velocity fluctuations and Reynolds stresses. They also tested the setup
with non-reactive flows to draw a comparison. With the additional
data, they further supported the conclusions of Cabra et al. [44]
regarding auto-ignition as the possible stabilization mechanism. The
most noteworthy result was related to the high sensitivity of the sys-
tem. Using the same fuel jet and imposing a reduction of 13 K to the
coflow temperature (from 1034 to 1021 K), the apparent lift-off
height doubled and the profile of turbulent kinetic energy changed
significantly. This change in the coflow was achieved by reducing the
H2 molar fraction in the coflow pre-burner by only 0.2%. They sug-
gested that the flame with the hottest coflow behaved as a conven-
tional diffusion flame, while the other relied on auto-ignition for
stabilization, as fluctuations were more intense.

A more detailed experimental campaign using the same burner was
presented by Gordon et al. [49]. They were able to simultaneously
acquire temperature and to perform OH and CH2O imaging. The experi-
ments were conducted using a natural gas, CH4 and He mixture instead
of the H2(cid:1)(cid:1)N2 mixture used in the previous experiments. This mixture
was developed to match the fuel and coflow Rayleigh cross-section, in
order to minimize errors and allow quantification of temperature and
OH. The results showed the presence of CH2O and ignition kernels early
in the jet. Supported by transient laminar simulations, these character-
istics were speculated to be necessary for the formation of a stable
flame further downstream. The authors analysed the flames statistically
and identified three distinct regions. Such regions were located
sequentially downstream the jet and were based on the frequency of
structures. The first region was characterized by the presence of CH2O
with practically no OH and was related to the “building of a radical
pool”. Further downstream, ignition kernels were frequent, marked by
the presence of OH radical in an intermittent fashion. The last region
was identified as the stabilized flame, with a discernible flame front.
Therefore, Gordon et al. [49] provided insights into the structures and
mechanisms involved in auto-ignition and stabilization for that particu-
lar system.

By comparing the works of Gordon et al. [49] and Medwell et al.
[39], it is again possible to identify how difficult it is to reach a general

The works of Oldenhof et al. [46,54,55] were able to demonstrate
that the mechanism of stabilization in the investigated hot diluted
coflows is fundamentally different from that of conventional diffusion
flames, supporting previous works [40,41,49]. In conventional lifted
flames, the propagation of energy and radicals from the reaction zone
to the incoming reactants is responsible for stabilization. In most of
the hot coflow flames, the entrainment of coflow into the fuel stream
causes auto-ignition at sparse random regions due to the low reactiv-
ity of the mixture and its high temperature. The stabilization is then a
combined effect of both auto-ignition and flame propagation. The
main particularity of this series of experiments was the combined use
of PIV and OH measurements, as well as comparisons with ambient
temperature coflows.

Usually, a precise prediction of lift-off height for diffusion flames is
a good indicator for assessing the modelling accuracy as it is depen-
dent on turbulent mixing, chemistry and their interaction. In a hot
coflow environment, as the reactions become distributed and the gra-
dients decrease, such definition is not as straightforward and the dif-
ferent possible definitions give rise to large discrepancies. Medwell
et al. [39] pointed out that the definition used to define the lift-off is
arguable for hot coflow conditions. This issue was later approached
by Oldenhof et al. [54]. The proposed lift-off height evaluations were
statistically derived based on several instantaneous chemilumines-
cence snapshots, instead of an average image. One of the definitions
proposed was the height in which the probability of finding flame
luminescence was 50%.

The effect of fuel jet Re on lift-off heights was found to be rather
remarkable and is explained by the stabilization mechanism. The
lift-off height was lower with increasing Re up to a certain value of
Re, after which the lift-off height started to increase. With jet Re
higher than 5000 (bearing in mind this value is case-dependent) the
lift-off height increased with increasing Re. The initial reduction in
the lift-off heights is explained by the entrainment of hot coflow
caused by the fuel stream momentum, which compensates the
increase in convection. The authors pointed that higher jet Re, and
consequently higher turbulence levels, decrease the growth of
ignition kernels and even extinguish nascent kernels.

These conclusions pointed to possible difficulties in computational
modelling. As stabilization in such conditions is highly dependent on
local stochastic phenomena, RANS approaches would tend to fail,
unless a robust statistical treatment can be employed. Additionally, the
local transient entrainment should be well predicted [54], further
pointing towards unsteady RANS or LES approaches.

The effect of having higher alkanes in the fuel stream was also
investigated by Oldenhof et al. [54], by adding C2H6 to CH4 or
natural gas. Such investigations are interesting from a practical
point of view since commonly used fuels are more complex than
CH4 or H2. As result of the C2H6 addition, the chemical time-scales
were reduced, causing a reduction in the lift-off height (similar
effect as raising coflow temperature). Evans et al. [56] observed
the same behaviour for CH4(cid:1)(cid:1)C2H4 blends in the Adelaide burner
with the increase of C2H4: the visual lift-off height of the flames
decreased substantially and the luminosity gradients increased,
suggesting the C2H4-rich flames are more similar to conventional
diffusion flames. Such behaviour can be expected as the auto-igni-
tion temperatures tend to decrease for higher hydrocarbons.
Therefore, the use of higher hydrocarbon fuels can prevent or
impair the attainment of FC, especially for configurations that
mainly rely on mixing prior to ignition.

The effect of fuel composition was approached differently by Med-
well and Dally [45]. The Adelaide burner was used to compare the
behaviour of natural gas, ethylene, and LPG, all diluted in a 1:1 volu-
metric ratio with H2. The coflow had again 3 or 9% oxygen in volume
and jet Re was constant for all cases. They found the behaviour to be
similar between the three fuels in terms of OH, CH2O, and tempera-
ture, probably due to H2 addition. Notably, H2 addition was necessary

conclusions. Although measured quantities were the same, the tech-
niques employed had different capabilities. Moreover, fuel composi-
tion, jet velocities, Reynolds numbers and coflow composition were
different. Therefore, two different structures have been reported: (i)
flames with a weak region of OH followed by a stronger reaction zone
[39] and (ii) flames with the three regions as described by Gordon
et al. [49]. However, the apparent difference could be a result of dif-
ferent setups and measurement systems.

As an attempt to reach more general conclusions, Gordon et al. [41]
further analysed the obtained data [49] while also comparing to data
from other sources. The authors used the product of the OH and CH2O
images to represent the heat release rate (HRR), as first suggested by
Najm et al. [50]. They verified the validity of this approach on the auto-
igniting flames and concluded that while the progression of these
flames is different from well-known lifted diffusion flames, they behave
similarly from the height where medium-sized kernels appear. More-
over, the flame structures had similarities with triple flames (as
described by Dold [51]), evidencing the partially-premixed nature of the
JHC flames analysed. The correlation between species concentrations
and HRR was recently studied by Sidey and Mastorakos [52]. They per-
formed extensive calculations comparing conventional flames and
flames under FC conditions to correlate HRR and chemical species. They
found HCO to be a poor marker, while CH2O performed better. Addi-
tionally, OH* emission was significantly lower than in conventional
flames, even when OH peaks were similar, further explaining the low
luminosity of flames under FC. Therefore, the analysis of Gordon et al.
[41] is in line with the most recent developments.

Another series of experiments was introduced by the work of Old-
enhof et al. [53]. The authors presented the Delft-Jet-in-Hot-Coflow
(DJHC) burner (shown in Fig. 7) and results regarding the symmetry of
the velocity and temperature fields, key for good quality of the experi-
ments. Further investigating the stabilization characteristics mentioned
by Medwell et al. [39] and Gordon et al. [49], Oldenhof et al. [46,54,55]
compared flames in cold and hot coflows, the formation of ignition ker-
nels, and the stabilization mechanisms especially relying on a statistical
approach. The studies made use of velocity, temperature, flame lumi-
nescence and OH radical data to draw conclusions regarding the effects
of fuel jet Re and fuel composition (natural gas and CH4(cid:1)(cid:1)C2H6 blends
were tested) on flame stabilization.

to avoid flame blow-off, pointing to its high influence in the overall
behaviour. The authors performed laminar flame calculations to ana-
lyse conditions with and without H2, as an attempt to determine its
effect. Although the auto-ignition temperature of H2 is relatively
high, the analysis showed that H2 improves reactivity by increasing
the concentration of essential radicals as CH2O and HCO.

Given the unique behaviour of H2 in such systems, Arteaga Mendez
et al. [47] compared different proportions of H2 feeding the DJHC setup.
Natural gas was used undiluted or blended with 5, 10 or 25% H2 (in vol-
ume). Ignition kernels were clearly visible for the flame with no H2
addition, and were only discernible for the flame with 5% H2, while it
was not possible to capture kernels in the 10 and 25% H2 flames.

Interestingly, when calculating the lift-off height as proposed by
Oldenhof et al. [54], the probability of spotting flame luminescence
was much more distributed for the case without H2 (Fig. 8). Therefore,
H2 either shifts the stabilization mechanism to that present in conven-
tional lifted flames, or the occurrence and development of auto-ignition
kernels happen in a much shorter length. How such differences would
affect pollutant emissions is not completely clear. However, the tem-
perature data provided by Arteaga Mendez et al. [47] shows larger gra-
dients of temperature for the case with more H2, which would
it is also not clear
potentially increase NOx emissions. Moreover,
whether the cases are actually operating under the FC regime.

As the importance of auto-ignition and sparse ignition kernels in the
JHC configuration became evident, the interest in the transient response
of such systems emerged [57-60]. Especially, the difference (if any)
between conventional and auto-ignited FC is not clear, and studying the
development of a fuel jet can reveal the mechanism regulating flame
stabilization. Although the analysis of transient conditions is complex, it
allows a simplification related to the stabilization mechanisms: as there
is no developed flame, the energy transfer from the downstream reac-
tions is limited. Such studies shall continue to help identify conditions
in which auto-ignition occurs. For example, Oldenhof et al. [57] pointed
out that ignition tends to occur in regions where the velocities are close
to that of the coflow, which means less shear.

Remarkably, in view of the objective of this review, the most impor-
tant conclusion derived from the experiments with the DJHC is regard-
ing how representative JHC flames are in relation to industrial

applications. Analysing velocity data conditional to the presence of
flame zones, Oldenhof et al. [55] concluded that most of the flame was
not exposed to strong turbulence, since reactions occurred mostly in
the low Re coflow streams entrained by the jet. The highest coflow Re
had been achieved with the Cabra burner and were below 6000, as
shown in Fig. 9. Therefore, many JHC flames studied so far may not be
representative of conditions encountered in industrial applications and
thus conclusions derived from their analysis and modelling should be
extrapolated cautiously. JHC burners operating at higher Re and Ka
may overcome this limitation, as discussed below.

Medwell and Dally [61] also dealt with how well JHC flames repre-
sent FC. They proposed a distinction between lifted flames and FC
flames (treated by the authors as MILD) in the experiments using the
JHC configuration. According to the authors, the experiments per-
formed with the Cabra burner and the DJHC [44,24,46,54] should be
considered as lifted flames, while the experiments with the Adelaide
burner [34,38,39] are in the FC regime. However, this classification
was based on the observed lift-off heights, which is an arguable
parameter, as pointed out by Oldenhof et al. [54].

Interestingly, the authors extended the conditions previously experi-
mented with the Adelaide burner (from 3 to 9% up to 11 and 12%),
attempting to analyse the change from FC to conventional lifted flame.
The work of Medwell and Dally [61] is the responsible for the broader
range of O2 concentration and fuel jet Re in the Adelaide burner, depicted
in Fig. 9. It was difficult to identify patterns in the lift-off height behav-
iour while varying coflow temperatures, coflow O2 concentration, and
fuel-jet Re separately. This could be either a result of the complex physics
not regulated by single variables, or by limitations in the definition of the
lift-off height. Anyhow, the lack of a good definition for the FC regime
once again impedes the interpretation of results.

Duwig et al. [62] presented a coflow burner with a premixed cen-
tral jet surrounded by a McKenna burner to generate the coflow
(Fig. 10). The burner was named Distributed and Flameless Combus-
tion Burner (DFCB). Attempting to address the problems mentioned
by Oldenhof et al. [55], this burner was able to operate at high Ka
(estimated to be up to 14,000), with increased levels of turbulence as
compared to previous experiments. Premixed mixtures were injected
through the central plug, thus, the setup shares similarities with the
piloted premixed jet burner, studied by Dunn et al. [63].

Different CH4/air equivalence ratios were explored in the central
jet composition, with two lean mixtures (0.6 and 0.8) and one rich
(6.0). The premise was to compare FC under very lean conditions, cre-
ated by the lean central jets and the vitiated coflow (gas turbines),
and conditions close to stoichiometry (furnaces). The authors showed
that the cross-correlation of the OH and CH2O signals was negative,
pointing that OH starts to increase as the initially produced CH2O
begins to decay in these flames, corroborating the aforementioned
findings of Gordon et al. [49]. The differences between the lean and

temperature affected fuel viscosity, similarly to what Cavaliere and
de Joannon [15] predicted to happen under FC. Such characteristics
change the velocity field near the atomizer, altering the entrainment
of coflow. These experiments pointed to the need of an accurate
spray model for such conditions. Such models would be useful for
application in gas turbines.

Analysing the studies using the JHC mentioned so far, it is evident
that the gap between these laboratory scale experiments and condi-
tions that would be encountered in practical applications is not yet
bridged. Despite the fact that JHC burners provide the most detailed
databases and a relatively simpler configuration for modelling, its
suitability for gas turbine related conditions is arguable. Furthermore,
most experiments disregard pollutant formation, a key aspect in the
analysis and application of FC.

3.2. Experiments in enclosed environment

The conventional JHC open-air configuration is certainly the most
studied related to FC conditions. However, a range of experiments
was performed using laboratory devices with enclosures. Their com-
plexity tends to be higher than for JHC in terms of geometry and flow
characteristics, while optical access is rather limited. Usually, there is
a trade-off between complexity and diagnostics: more complex
geometries and enclosed flames are not easily accessible for advanced
combustion diagnostics techniques, but are potentially more repre-
sentative of the actual application. Importantly, data on emissions is
usually present. Experiments in enclosures were performed in both
axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric environment.

The experiments discussed in the following two sub-sections often
focus on pollutant emissions, as this is one of the main benefits of using
enclosures. The emissions generated in such systems is to some extent
dependent on residence times (especially to allow CO to be converted
into CO2) and recirculation (especially due to NOx reburning, further
discussed in Section 4.2). Changing operational conditions of systems
such as equivalence ratio, inlet temperatures, velocities, etc., inevitably
modifies residence times and/or recirculation, partly explaining the diffi-
culties in achieving low emissions for broad operational range. This is
also the case for the designs discussed in Section 5.

The works reviewed in the next two sub-sections are summarized
in Table 3. As can be seen, most of the experiments are still conducted
at atmospheric pressures, which indicates that the field is nascent.

3.2.1. Axisymmetric environment

A fuel jet surrounded by a hot coflow in an enclosure was pre-
sented by Rebola et al. [73]. Preheated air surrounding a methane jet
entered the combustion chamber at the same axial location. The
setup did not have optical access as priority was given to thermal
insulation. Temperatures and species (including CO, NOx and UHC)
were point-measured at axial and radial stations, for several operat-
ing conditions. The type of data available is entirely different from
the aforementioned JHC experiments. The focus was on measuring
pollutant emissions, while flame structure and intermediate species
could not be accessed. Although model validation is hardly possible
using the dataset, its focus on emissions provides an opportunity to
assess some relevant aspects for FC. The NOx emissions were
observed to be lower than 10 ppm throughout all operational condi-
tions. On the other hand, CO emission levels reached thousands of
ppm for the leaner operation conditions.

Some works reported the use of reverse flow combustion
chambers. This configuration is better suited for FC as the recircu-
lation ratio is higher due to the geometry. Kruse et al. [74] adapted
a laboratory scale rig (Fig. 11) previously used to study furnaces
[14,75] for gas turbine relevant operating conditions. As the optical
access was limited, only OH* chemiluminescence was measured in
a small portion of the chamber. The most valuable output of this
experiment was related to the behaviour of CO and NOx emissions

centre of a McKenna burner. Premixed methane and air was injected through the plug.

rich jets were mostly exhibited in the joint PDF of the estimated layer
thicknesses of OH and CH2O at the axial location with the lowest val-
ues of cross-correlation. A thicker CH2O brush followed by a thinner
and more defined OH brush was found in the rich case, as opposed to
the thinner CH2O region followed by a wrinkled and less intense OH
brush for the lean cases.

The authors concluded that the turbulence-chemistry interaction
would therefore be fundamentally different between a gas turbine
application and a furnace in the FC regime. However, full validation
of such statement requires more studies, especially on the influence
of higher Ka, which is still unclear. Furthermore, the lean and rich
cases also differ in the degree of premixedness. This fact is one of the
possible explanations for the differences in the size and characteris-
tics of the CH2O and OH regions. The higher premixedness of the lean
cases possibly allowed auto-ignition to occur closer to the injection
(causing a thinner CH2O brush).

In order to simplify experiments and modelling, gaseous fuels
were chosen for the first sets of experiments with JHC. To study fuels
that are normally in the liquid state without getting into the compli-
cations of the spray dynamics, a burner analogous to the Adelaide
burner was employed using pre-vaporized ethanol [65] and n-hep-
tane [66]. The ethanol flames showed behaviour similar to previous
investigations when varying coflow O2 concentrations (3, 6, 9 and
11% by volume). The apparent lift-off height peaked at 6% O2, thereby
exhibiting a non-monotonic behaviour. The same was observed for
CH4 and C2H4 [61], but not for n-heptane [66], for which the lift-off
height decreased with increasing O2 in the coflow. The authors had
previously related the non-monotonic behaviour of lift-off height in
relation to O2 coflow concentration in the Adelaide burner to a shift
between FC and conventional lifted flames [61]. Regardless of the dis-
pute concerning the lift-off height definition, these results indicate
anew that attaining FC is possibly more challenging with more com-
plex hydrocarbons.

As fuels in the liquid state are very important for a series of appli-
cations, the use of vitiated coflows along with fuel sprays was also
addressed with JHC burners. Cabra et al. [67,68] performed droplet-
size measurements using methanol in the Cabra burner as early as
2000. However, more in-depth experiments with sprays were only
performed later, first focusing on auto-ignition [69,70], followed by
investigations related to FC [71,72].

The spray structure and stabilization were discussed through a
comparison between non-preheated air coflow and diluted hot
coflow [71] on an improved burner compared to the DJHC with
respect to increased coflow diameter and more uniform temperature
and velocity profiles in the coflow. Gas phase velocities on the plane
of the fuel atomizer were measured, data was acquired on droplets
velocity and sizes, as well as temperatures. Similar to the stabiliza-
tion mechanism for gaseous fuels, the authors concluded that auto-
ignition plays a central role, as there was sufficient energy to vapor-
ize and ignite the fuel in the hot coflow case. The hot environment
led to the faster breakup of the liquid sheets as the coflow

in relation to equivalence ratio and operational pressure. The NOx
emissions dropped for increasing pressure and a low-emission
operating window was identified.

Ye et al. [76] explored the same setup but employing pre-vapor-
ized fuels (ethanol, acetone and n-heptane). Fuel was injected up to a
pressure of 5 bar in the combustion chamber. The results showed a
comparison between the fuels operating at different pressures and
equivalence ratios. Interestingly, the NOx emissions increased with
operating pressure, in contrary to what was observed in some of the
cases using CH4 explored by Kruse et al. [74].

Comparison between the different fuels is difficult due to the fixed
geometry. If the equivalence ratio is to be kept constant, airflow rate
has to be varied, thereby influencing the velocity fields, residence
times and reaction zones. Castela et al. [77] evidenced the limitation
of such geometries using a similar reverse flow configuration. The
experiments were carried out at atmospheric pressure as the com-
bustion took place within a quartz-glass cylinder to allow optical
access. The coupling between air inlet temperature, air velocity and
equivalence ratio does not allow to easily extrapolate the results to
different systems. However, some patterns could be identified.
Increasing air inlet velocity caused a reduction in NOx emissions for
the same inlet temperatures. This behaviour is expected since equiva-
lence ratio decreased as air velocity was increased.

Veríssimo et al. [78] introduced a series of experiments carried
out in a combustor very similar to the one used by Castela et al.
[77] but with a direct flow configuration. The geometry shares
similarities with the FLOX(cid:1) architecture (presented in Section 5
of this paper), having one central air jet surrounded by 16 radially
distributed fuel jets. Until recently, the only optical diagnostics
were performed was OH* chemiluminescence, while temperatures
and species were point-measured with probes. The authors
focused on the effect of changing operating parameters on pollut-
ant emissions and OH* distribution: namely equivalence ratio
[78], air jet velocity [79], power input [80], and air temperature
[81], although it is important to note that these parameters are
not necessarily independent in such a system.

Their first set of experiments [78] focused on the combustion
regime and emissions, while equivalence ratio was altered. The
power input was constant, as well as inlet air temperature. Therefore,
lower equivalence ratios represented higher air flow. Due to
increased mixing, the reaction zone moved upstream (closer to the
injection) with lower equivalence ratios. The intensity of the reac-
tions was also higher in terms of OH* (Fig. 12).

Regarding the emissions, while NOx increased up to a certain
level of excess air (F = 0.53) and then decreased slightly, the CO
emissions exhibited an opposite behaviour. This is in contrast with
what is expected from typical combustion systems in which the NOx
emission increases with equivalence ratio and peaks at around an
eq. ratio of 1. The authors mentioned that, possibly, the effect of
enhanced entrainment competed with the reduction in global resi-
dence time for decreasing equivalence ratios, and the balance
between the two shifted, explaining the behaviour of CO emissions.
The increase in NOx is consistent with increased intensity and possi-
ble generation of hotspots. However, the reason for its slight reduc-
tion with further decrease in equivalence ratio is not clear.

Subsequently, Veríssimo et al. [79] attempted to systematically
investigate the effect of heat input on the emissions. They kept the air-
fuel-ratio constant throughout all conditions, as well as inlet tempera-
tures. As thermal input was increased, reactions moved downstream as
a result of increased momentum. While the NOx emissions exhibited
little variations, the CO emission increased with thermal input. Hypo-
thetically, maintaining the ratio between air and fuel, as well as their
jets momenta did not change the overall mixing pattern much and
therefore the emissions were not affected. In the case of NOx, the shift
in the reaction zone downstream did not affect the final value of NOx,
but the CO formation increased, probably due to a lower residence
time. These results once again point to difficulties in attaining a sys-
tematic variation of operational parameters in combustors with jet
induced mixing (subject also discussed in Section 5).

Maintaining mass flows while increasing air flow velocity (by
decreasing the nozzle area), did not shift the reactions downstream.
The peaks of OH* occurred at the same location, while the reactions

were more distributed for higher air velocities. The CO emissions also
increased with velocity, but NOx emission reduced due to the distrib-
uted reaction zone. Hence, the works of Veríssimo et al. [79,80] are
another indication that mixing and recirculation drive the emissions
behaviour in FLOX(cid:1) type combustors.

The effect of air preheating was also analysed [81] at a chosen F of
0.77. Due to the change in density,
increasing air temperature
increased jet velocities, thereby enhancing the mixing. At this equiva-
lence ratio, an increase in the oxidiser inlet temperature caused an
increase in both CO and NOx emissions. The NOx increased due to
higher initial
temperatures and higher peak temperatures, as
denoted by the higher gradients in OH*. The increase in CO is proba-
bly caused by the reduction in the residence time.

The works of Veríssimo et al. [78(cid:1)81] provide a good database for
model comparison and for descriptive analysis, especially regarding
pollutant emissions. However, the varied parameters are coupled with
other variables in such systems, hindering the comprehension regard-
ing why each parameter variation yields a certain effect, also the heat
loss from the combustor is an important parameter which is not mea-
sured in detail during the experiments. In order to provide more infor-
mation related to this geometry, the work of Zhou et al. [82] presented
measurements of OH and CH2O for three cases previously explored,
named “conventional”, “transitional”, and “flameless” (e, c and a in
Fig. 12, respectively). As pointed in various JHC experiments, the forma-
tion of CH2O occurred upstream in relation to the region with higher
OH* for the “flameless” case. Also in line with previous experiments,
the standard deviation of the OH signal was larger in the “flameless”
case, indicating higher intermittency. By increasing the operational
parameters and measured variables of this experimental setup,
it
would be possible to build a valuable database.

Swirl stabilized flames are common in gas turbines, and experi-
ments were performed to explore this technique [83(cid:1)87], in the
geometry schematically shown in Fig. 13. The use of vitiated oxidiser
is especially interesting for land-based gas turbines, as external recir-
culation is a possibility to attain the required dilution and preheating
of the reactants. Again, oxidiser was diluted with N2 and CO2 at vari-
ous ratios [83], while CH4, C3H8, a H2(cid:1)(cid:1)CH4 mixture [84], ethanol and
JP-8 [85] were used as fuels. The reactions took place in a transparent
tube to enable acquisition of OH chemiluminescence, while emissions
were monitored. A more detailed analysis was carried out having
only CH4 as fuel, as velocity fields under reactive and non-reactive
flows were assessed using PIV [86]. Additionally, OH was measured
with PLIF. To some extent, these works share similarities with the
above-mentioned jet-stabilized experiments by Veríssimo et al. [78-
82], in terms of the difficulty encountered in generalising the results
of the experiments due to the large number of dependencies encoun-
tered in the system.

3.2.2. Non-Axisymmetric environment

The advantages of having axisymmetric configurations were
previously mentioned. However, not every condition can be
achieved with such geometries, especially those involving large
recirculation rates. Furthermore, several engineering application

Gupta [87].

of FC have non-axisymmetric geometries and experiments aimed
at replicating their conditions occasionally have to adopt non-axi-
symmetric configurations.

Sidey and Mastorakos [88] tested a canonical three-dimensional
configuration: a jet in crossflow Fig. 14. A methane jet was studied
for several crossflow compositions (from 3.7 to 8.7% O2) and tempera-
tures. Both steady and transient conditions were assessed via OH PLIF
and OH* chemiluminescence, and the findings were in line with most
of other JHC experiments. The geometry was highly three-dimen-
sional, posing complex flow patterns as compared to JHC cases. The
main advantages of using such configuration are the examination of
pollutant formation in an enclosure and the attainment of possibly
higher Ka numbers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only
work that reported such configuration specifically to study FC. There
is extensive literature concerning auto-ignition in cross-flow, as
reported by Medwell and Dally [61], but not with a focus on examin-
ing FC. Therefore, it is still not clear if such 3D configuration would be
able to provide more relevant insights or if it would be more suited to
operate in the FC regime.

Khalil and Gupta [89] explored another configuration to achieve
the FC regime in a relatively simple design. They used a cylindrical
chamber with relatively low aspect ratio and a nearly tangential air
inlet, while the exhaust was placed in the centre of the cylindrical
chamber. They tested four configurations of fuel inlet, including a pre-
mixed case, coaxial injection (partially-premixed) and different injec-
tion positions for non-premixed. The location and direction of fuel
injection was shown to directly affect the emissions. As the premixed

low for most of the operational range. A drawback of this experiment is
its large residence time (average of 0.5 s), which does not corroborate
with the residence times encountered in gas turbines.

Notably, this kind of setup does not allow to clearly follow the
path-lines of incoming reactants and their mixing pattern with recir-
culated combustion products as in e.g. JHC experiments. Quantifying
the recirculation of products is one of the main difficulties. Therefore,
these configurations are not suited for understanding auto-ignition
or reaction progress. However, they can be useful to the development
of concepts relying on large recirculation zones, such as FLOXCOM,
FOGT and AHEAD, discussed in Section 5.

3.3. Observations and recommendations

The aforementioned works provide valuable information and data
for model validation and comparison. Further investigation should be
performed in order to make this type of experiment even more useful
towards the application of FC to gas turbines. As an example, having a
JHC operating in an enclosed and pressurized environment, while
employing conventional and candidate alternative fuels could pro-
vide valuable indications for future gas turbine designs. It is notable
that most experiments performed in enclosures had atmospheric
conditions.

Many works point to the fact that stabilization under the FC
regime depends on auto-ignition kernels, which in turn are highly
dependent on local fluctuations and conditions. Disregarding the dis-
pute related to the definition of the FC regime (discussed in Section
2), this hints to the need of using statistical models or unsteady
approaches to achieve successful modelling.

However, it is not proven if it is necessary to model all the features
of the flame in order to predict the emissions accurately. From a
design point-of-view, experiments should also contain emissions
measurements, which unfortunately is not provided by most of the
JHC experiments. Data on pollutant emissions from JHC flames are
not necessarily the most
they are
non-enclosed and, therefore, not representative of any application.
On the other hand, modelling could benefit from comparisons with
such data, as the literature lacks detailed data combining flame mor-
phology and structure with pollutant formation. If these would be
combined with an enclosed and pressurized environment, the resul-
tant data would be even more relevant.

relevant due to the fact

The huge gap between laboratory scale experiments and gas tur-
bine operating environment is evident. On one hand, effort should be
concentrated to determine the conditions in which FC would take
place in gas turbines in terms of energy density, turbulence intensity,
Da, Ka, and recirculation ratios. On the other hand, the design of
experimental setups able to replicate these conditions in simplified
configurations, while allowing range modulation and state-of-the-art
diagnostics, are required. These two combined can provide the

[90].

case had the lowest emission values, one can argue that the mixing
between products and incoming fuel and air was poor, leading to the
existence of hot-spots (higher NOx emissions) and incomplete com-
bustion (higher CO emissions). Furthermore, whether the experi-
ments come under the FC regime is uncertain.

Another cyclonic combustion chamber was presented by Sorren-
tino et al. [90,91]. The prismatic chamber had oxidiser jets positioned
along opposing corners to generate swirling motion, while the
exhaust was positioned at the centre of the top face (Fig. 15). The
design intended to achieve relatively high residence times. The cham-
ber was operated with several levels of dilution (by either CO2 or N2)
and preheating temperatures, with propane as fuel. As a result, they
were able to build diagrams indicating the combustion regime as a
function of equivalence ratio and inlet temperature (Fig. 16). With
temperatures lower than approximately 925 K, no combustion
occurred. Between 925 and 1000 K, reactions took place but were not
complete as temperature rise was not significant, while for higher
inlet temperature, reactions were sustained and the authors consid-
ered it to be under the MILD regime. An intermediate region was
identified for a range of equivalence ratios categorized as “dynamic”
because of the large intermittency.

As far as gas turbine application is concerned, dilution with CO2 is
more interesting than with N2. Due to different behaviours in relation
to third body reactions, the results for each diluent had slight dissimi-
larities. The regimes showed less dependence on the equivalence
ratio when using CO2.

The system presented hysteresis when altering the inlet temperature
[92]. The CO emissions increased up to a certain level when gradually
increasing the inlet temperature. After a given value of inlet tempera-
ture, CO emissions suddenly decreased. On the other hand, if tempera-
tures were decreased starting from the highest temperatures the
emission levels remained low. The NOx emissions were reported to be

necessary bridge to enhance our understanding of the FC regime and
enable us to come-up with design methods.

4. Computational modelling

The challenge of modelling reacting flows is often related to how
simplifications and assumptions impose discrepancies in relation to
the actual behaviour and how these deviations change for different
operating conditions. The comparison between computational
modelling and experimental data is not only interesting to assess the
validity of models, but also to provide information on variables that
were not measured or are difficult to measure during an experiment.
Throughout the years the effect of possible simplifications in the
modelling of premixed and diffusion flames has become clear. How-
ever, development of models able to yield good results across differ-
ent regimes (partially premixed combustion) or for a broad range of
operational conditions still remains a challenge.

Typically, the main interest in simulating gas turbine combustors
is for predicting temperature fields and emissions. The latter is espe-
cially important for FC, since it is the main reason why the combus-
tion regime is attractive. However, no consensus exists on which
features of the flow field and chemical reactions must be accurately
modelled in order to have accurate pollutant emissions prediction.

Taking the previous remarks into account, in this section we give
an overview of modelling approaches, report on new developments
that have been made especially aimed towards representation of FC
conditions. Subsequently, an overview of the main results obtained
with direct numerical simulation and in the various model evaluation
studies, which most often are done using the experiments discussed
in Section 3 as validation database.

4.1. Overview of modelling approaches

Due to the uncertainties regarding the underlying physics, virtu-
ally every known approach has been tried for modelling the FC
regime. Bilger et al. [93] have very well summarized such approaches
or paradigms, and the theoretical background is not discussed in
details here. The models discussed in this work are presented in the
schematic of Fig. 17. Different models are given a location considering
two criteria: the level of detail in the description of turbulence and
the level of detail in the chemistry. The size of the boxes given to a
model reflects the actual practice in published works related to
modelling of the FC regime. The colour shading gives an indication of
the complexity of the description of the turbulence-chemistry inter-
action.

Fig. 17. Schematic of the most used approaches for modelling FC in relation to turbu-
lence, chemistry, turbulence-chemistry interaction, and computational costs.

Solving the flow field via Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) pro-
vides a complete description of the turbulence. The computational
cost is very high and therefore most often is carried out in combina-
tion with simple chemistry. The configurations that can be handled
have a simple geometry, relevant for fundamental studies and far
away from practical applications. Chemical Reactor Networks (CRN)
on the other hand put the computational effort in the detailed kinet-
ics and handle flow effects via mass flow rates between reactors and
the residence time in each reactor. Their parameters have to be cali-
brated for specific applications. The combination of turbulent flow
and chemical reaction can be handled in many different ways, work-
ing either in a Reynolds Averaged Navier(cid:1)Stokes (RANS) framework
or using Large Eddy Simulation (LES). In both approaches, the closure
of the mean or filtered chemical source term is the main issue [93].
The simplest option is to use RANS with an eddy dissipation model
(EDM) considering a comparison of chemical time scale deduced
from very simple chemistry and flow time scale from a turbulence
model to find the effective global reaction rate.

In flamelet models and their generalisations like Flamelet Generated
Manifold (FGM) [94] or Flamelet Progress Variable Approach (FPVA)
[95], a laminar flame structure is considered and all important thermo-
chemical properties and source terms are tabulated as a function of a
few independent variables using detailed chemistry. These approaches
fall in the more general category of ‘tabulated chemistry methods’.
Detailed chemistry can be included in these flamelet calculations. The
types of flamelets can cover both premixed and non-premixed or par-
tially premixed situations. To properly represent differential diffusion
effects it is important to use detailed laminar transport properties (non-
unity Lewis numbers) in the calculation of the laminar flames. To repre-
sent the combined effect of mixing and ignition in JHC flames, an ignit-
ing mixing layer (IML) has been proposed as a canonical flame structure
[96] as alternative for the unsteady counterflow diffusion flame. The
mean or resolved turbulent flame structure is computed using the state
or the source terms of the laminar flames and performing ensemble
averaging. The turbulence chemistry interaction is taken into account
via the probability density function (PDF) of independent variables,
which is most often taken as an assumed mathematical function
depending on a few parameters, typically mean and variance of mixture
fraction and progress variable. For low Reynolds number flames it may
be important to keep the mean laminar diffusion term including differ-
ential diffusion in the mean scalar transport equations. However, it has
lower impact than including the differential diffusion in the creation of
the lookup table [97]. Having the relatively low computational cost as an
advantage, these approaches have been extended and tested under sev-
eral conditions. A priori, it would seem that flamelet-based models for
FC are not a recommended option because the high mixing intensity
and dilution are supposed to lead to well-mixed conditions or at least
widely distributed reaction zones. However, some of the DNS studies
discussed in the next section concluded that thin reaction zones are also
present in FC conditions.

In contrast, many other models are built upon a micromixing model.
In principle, the importance of proper handling of the micromixing of
reacting scalars is high in FC because the chemical and flow time-scales
are in the same order of magnitude. In the Eddy Dissipation Concept
(EDC) model the micromixing model distinguishes between reaction
zones, often modelled as perfectly stirred or plug flow reactors and their
non-reacting environment. The time-scale of the large and small turbu-
lent eddies is taken into account to find the mass exchange rate
between the reaction zones and their surroundings. In the EDC frame-
work, skeletal or even more detailed chemistry can be afforded, but the
role of turbulent fluctuations on determining effective reaction rates is
not well represented. Transport equations for mean mass fractions are
solved and it is straightforward to include a detailed laminar diffusion
term when necessary. Calibration of model constants is often needed
and this aspect has received attention for FC, as is discussed in the sec-
tion on RANS applications below. More involved representations of

turbulent fluctuations are used in Conditional Moment Closure (CMC)
[98] and Conditional Source Estimation (CSE) [99] and in transported
PDF models [100]. Especially the transported PDF models allow for a
wide variety of micromixing models and their performance has received
a lot of attention in the past decades. CSE has similarities with CMC in
its formulation. Both CSE and CMC use conditional averages to compute
the chemical source term, while the conditional fluctuations are
assumed to be negligible (conditioned to mixture fraction). In the CMC,
transport equations for the conditional means of species and tempera-
ture are solved, while in the CSE these conditional means are obtained
by inverting the integral equation that relates the unconditional to the
conditional mean in a relation involving the (presumed) PDF. In the sec-
tions below, each addressing one of the types of models mentioned in
Fig. 12, more detailed description of the different models is given and
results reported. But before doing so the selection of chemical kinetic
scheme for FC is discussed in the next section.

4.2. Chemical kinetics

Here we briefly review the progress in the selection and perfor-
mance of detailed and reduced chemical kinetic schemes for combus-
tors working in the FC mode. Using appropriate chemical kinetics is
crucial, especially for emission predictions. It is known that under FC
reaction pathways and the interaction with transport phenomena are
different if compared to canonical premixed and diffusion flames. How-
ever, there is no complete consensus on the exact nature of these dif-
ferences and their influence on combustion and emissions.

Idealised reactors incorporating detailed kinetics on the one hand
are an affordable tool to study the relative importance of kinetic
pathways and on the other hand, are often considered representative
of intensely mixed conditions in FC. Such models are expected to be
able to predict trends in pollutant formation as overall parameters
change, making them suitable for sensitivity analysis. Nicolle and
Dagaut [101] presented ideal chemical reactor simulations performed
to analyse the NOx formation and destruction mechanisms under FC
conditions. Based on the definition of Cavaliere and de Joannon [15],
they employed a Partially Stirred Reactor (PaSR) model to evaluate
the behaviour of NO formation. The study pointed to the relevance of
chemical pathways that are frequently neglected in conventional
applications, such as the NNH and N2O pathways.

The reburning of NOx was also found to be relevant. Since the
beginning of the investigations on the FC regime, reburning has been
pointed out as an important mechanism [17], having more relevance
than in conventional combustion. Several works acknowledged the
need to include reburning reaction pathways in simulations related
to FC. Earlier works reported the use of simple approaches, as a single
global reaction representing reburning [102], while more recent
works included several reactions and analysed their relative contri-
butions [103]. Despite the tangible advances, there is no consensus
regarding which reactions should be included to a “reburning mecha-
nism” in order to achieve accurate predictions.

Recognizing the necessity of including usually neglected reactions,
Galletti et al. [104] proposed two new reduced chemical mechanisms
for CH4/H2 to be used under FC conditions, based on their analysis of
ideal chemical reactors. They analysed reaction rates at various tem-
peratures and pressures using detailed mechanisms in order to select
the most important reactions. Each of the two new mechanisms was
developed based on a different detailed mechanism (namely, the
POLIMI and the Glarborg mechanisms). The developed mechanisms
were then compared to other contemporary reaction mechanisms
used in CFD simulations related to the Adelaide burner. The newly
developed mechanisms showed better (and very similar) results.
Again, the NNH pathway proved to be relevant for the overall values,
while the inclusion of HNO and NO2 pathways was pointed as the
responsible for the better results with the developed reduced mecha-
nisms. Although deviations in relation to experimental data were still

present, it is not possible to attribute them solely to the chemical
mechanisms, as deviations could be a result of the CFD models and
their implementation.

Calculations of laminar flames with a simple flow pattern also
present an opportunity to validate detailed mechanisms by compari-
son with measurements. Sepman et al. [105] reported experimental
measurements and detailed computations of laminar jet flame of CH4
diluted with N2 in either preheated air or in a hot coflow containing
products of lean combustion of CH4. The calculations were performed
with two detailed mechanisms, GRI-mech 2.11 [106] and GRI-mech
3.0 [107], with well-documented modification of the NO chemistry,
based on recent literature, in the latter. The rate-of-production analy-
sis demonstrated that the Fenimore mechanism is the dominant
pathway of NO formation in all flames studied. The NO formation in
the MILD flame appears to be negligible (few ppm). The reported
detailed results obtained with the modified GRI-mech 3.0 mechanism
were found to be in good quantitative agreement with the measure-
ments. It would be of interest to investigate whether the same level
of agreement is achieved with different detailed and reduced mecha-
nisms mentioned above.

4.3. Direct numerical simulation

The DNS studies can provide valuable insight into the physical behav-
iour of the FC regime rather than directly aiding the design. This
approach avoids the uncertainties of turbulence modelling by employing
a computational grid that is able to capture the smallest turbulence
scales, without necessarily capturing the details of the flame structure.

Due to the immense computational cost of such simulations, the
domain size is limited. Therefore, DNS is not suited to compute most
of the laboratory scale experiments or (semi-) industrial scale appli-
cations. Nevertheless, valuable conclusions can be drawn from DNS
studies, especially concerning the interaction of flow and reaction
zones. They provide detailed databases to check the validity of com-
bustion models and provide inspiration for the development of new
models. However, the uncertainty in the definition of the FC regime
affects the relevance of DNS investigations. Many works use the con-
ditions of JHC experiments as a baseline to perform DNS and, there-
fore, may be out of the range of interest from a design point of view,
as highlighted in the previous section.

One of the first DNS related to FC, based on JHC configurations was
presented and analysed in a series of papers by Yoo et al. [25,108], Lu
et al. [109] and Luo et al. [110]. Using rectangular domains (a typical
requirement of DNS codes), H2 combustion in hot and diluted coflow
was simulated [25]. Jets and coflows were not round, but rectangular
as in slot-burners. Chemical Explosive Mode Analysis (CEMA) was
performed later to reach conclusions regarding the presence of auto-
ignition [109]. Similar steps were taken for an ethylene flame
[108,110], providing an interesting comparison between the behav-
iour of two fuels.

The findings were in line with the most recent JHC experiments:
auto-ignition and quenching were identified for both cases in a region
with high intermittency. The difference between C2H4 and H2 was on
the base structure of the flame. The H2 flames showed both auto-igni-
tion and upstream propagation of the kernels, while ethylene flames
exhibited no propagation. The comparison shown in Fig. 18 exhibits
the sudden variations in ethylene flames with step-like shapes, while
H2 had smoother spikes. Both the stabilization point (defined by a
threshold value of OH mass fraction) and the mixture fraction exhib-
ited such behaviour.

The CEMA results discussed for both cases [109,110] further sup-
ported the conclusions and showed that this may be a powerful
method to identify the type of ignition structures present in DNS and
LES. The delimitation of auto-igniting and diffusion flame regions is
done via the local evaluation of the eigenvalues of the chemical
source term Jacobian. The application of this method should be

further investigated as it has the potential to provide insights into the
boundaries and definition of the FC regime.

Another set of investigations [111,112] was performed using mix-
ing layers to mimic conditions found in the Adelaide experiments
[34]. Both 2D and 3D simulations were performed to evaluate the
effect of preferential diffusion, especially due to the presence of H2. In
the 2D simulations [111], the effect of preferential diffusion was
more important, as H2 chemistry was shown to be dominant for the
occurrence of ignition. However, such effect was shown to be less
prominent in the 3D simulations by G€oktolga et al. [112] as turbu-
lence structures were able to cascade to smaller scales as compared
to 2D. Such difference causes higher interaction between chemistry
and turbulence (as expected under the FC regime). Therefore, 2D DNS
is an incorrect representation of this case.

In the same investigations, the authors included the cooling effect
caused by the entrainment of ambient air in the coflow by imposing a
non-uniform temperature profile to the layer representing the
coflow. The results pointed to large differences in ignition behaviour
when including heat loss, once again pointing at the shortcomings of
JHC configurations and their consequences on simulations. Addition-
ally, these studies were the base for improving the definition of prog-
ress variables for chemical tabulations discussed in the following
section, as the role of radicals as HO2 was highlighted.

Focusing on the flame structures present in FC, a series of DNS was
performed for comparing representative conditions of FC and con-
ventional premixed flames. Boundary and initial conditions typical of
these regimes were carefully created before allowing the solutions to
evolve [113(cid:1)116]. The procedure to create such conditions involved
the evaluation of 1D laminar flames, which were referred to as MIFE
(MILD Flame Element) for the FC cases.

One of

the most

important conclusions from these works
[113,114] was that the flames in FC conditions displayed thin struc-
tures with frequent interaction between each other, having a com-
plex reaction front (Fig. 19) providing a surprising physical picture of
the typical portrayal as ‘well-distributed’ . The interaction between

the flamelets locally increases the reaction rates and thickens the
reaction zones [115].

Interestingly, the authors attempted to draw conclusions about LIF
by extracting the signal that would be acquired from 2D slices of their
DNS. In accordance with previous investigations, they concluded that
it is necessary to have signals from both OH and CH2O to represent
the heat release in FC conditions since OH gradients are not as large
as in conventional combustion.

In another creative approach, the DNS data was treated mathemati-
cally to evaluate the shapes of the reaction zones [116]. While the clas-
sical premixed case pointed to well-defined thin surfaces, FC was
shown to be composed of several shapes (distinguished by values of
planarity and filamentarity), while the probability of having “pancake-
like” structures (intermediate values of planarity and low values of fila-
mentarity) is the highest. The analysis pointed to a relation between
temporal progression and the probability of the shapes.

Following their findings using DNS, Minamoto and Swaminathan
[117] attempted to reproduce filtered DNS data. The PSR approach
with presumed PDF showed better results, especially for intermediate
species concentrations. The lack of interaction between the flamelets
was said to be the cause of the poor results for the MIFE approach.
The authors pointed that flamelet models should be modified to suc-
cessfully represent FC, with a formulation capable of taking the inter-
action between flamelets into account

As a conclusion, DNS may deliver more detailed information than
experiments and is extremely valuable for understanding and assessing
FC. However, in all mentioned works, Re and Ka are lower when com-
pared to most experiments and applications. Additionally, there are
always sensitivities with respect to chemistry modelling and numerical
treatment that should be considered before generalizing the results.

4.4. Extension of tabulated chemistry

Both FGM and FPVA are examples of tabulated chemistry meth-
ods. These methods combine detailed treatment of reactions and dif-
fusion with a relatively low computation cost because of the use of a

low-dimensional representation of the set of states accessed in a
flame (depending only on a selected set of controlling variables). In
short, they can provide an efficient and simplified description of the
thermochemical state of the reacting flow. They can be used in com-
bination with any type of flame calculation, from laminar flow and
DNS, to RANS and LES. In the case of RANS and LES, they have to be
supplied with a model for the fluctuations of the independent vari-
able. In this section, we only consider the novel developments needed
in the creation of the lookup tables, whereas the applications in RANS
and LES are discussed in subsequent sections.

Even when a given detailed mechanism is chosen, the application
of tabulated chemistry methods can be performed according to differ-
ent procedures. The set of laminar flames or other idealised reactors
used as input must be chosen and also the set of progress variables
selected as independent variables in the representation of the lami-
nar flame results must be chosen. Some new developments were
needed in order to address dilution and ignition aspects encountered
in the FC regime.

First, in order to represent the influence of dilution (due to
external or internal recirculation in applications), it is possible to
introduce diluted streams as boundary conditions in flamelets.
This leads to an extra independent variable representing the
degree of dilution. Locci et al. [118] and Colin et al. [119] and
also Lamouroux et al. [120] introduced such approaches with the
objective of simulating furnaces operating in FC mode. These
works resulted in equations describing mixture fraction, progress
variable and dilution variable. The model was applied to the fur-
nace experiments of Veríssimo et al. [78-82]. An FGM model with
dilution variable proposed by Huang et al. [121,122] is included
in the comparative study presented in Section 4.8.

In the case of the JHC configuration the dilution of the oxidiser
stream is predefined by the settings of the secondary burner and it
would seem that a dilution variable taking a range of values would
not be needed, but in practice the coflow is not perfectly homoge-
neous in composition and an additional
independent scalar to
describe the deviations from homogeneity is needed to accurately
represent this. If the inhomogeneity is describing a local excess of
oxygen, to very good approximation the same extra variable can also
be used to describe entrainment of air from the surroundings further
downstream. Ihme et al. [123,124] developed this extension in the
frame of the FPVA. The chosen progress variable was a linear combi-
nation of CO2, H2O, CO and H2 mass fractions. Sarras et al. [125] intro-
duced a similar approach in the frame of FGM based on unsteady
igniting flamelets and steady flamelets as inputs for the tabulation.
An additional independent scalar was introduced representing nor-
malised O2 concentration in the range between minimal value occur-
ring in the coflow and in air. The progress variable was based on CO2,
H2O, and H2. They also added normalised enthalpy loss as a fourth
independent variable in the FGM, in order to represent the inhomo-
geneous profile of mean and standard deviation of temperature in
the coflow. The results obtained by Ihme et al. (using LES) and Sarras
et al. (using RANS with transported PDF) are discussed in Sections 4.6
and 4.5.3, respectively.

Domingo et al. [126] proposed the combination of auto-ignition
chemistry (using PSRs) and premixed flamelets as input for the crea-
tion of tabulated chemistry for auto-igniting flames. The relative
weight of PSR and premixed flamelet was then made dependent on
the value of progress variable, assuming a larger contribution of the
auto-igniting regime for low values of progress variable, while the
premixed tabulation was dominant for high values of progress vari-
able. The results are discussed in the section on LES (4.6).

The use and extension of the FGM approach for FC conditions was
investigated by G€oktolga et al. [127], based on some of the conclusions
from the DNS study presented by G€oktolga et al. [112]. The conditions
of the JHC experiment performed by Dally et al. [34] were considered,
and the authors investigated the behaviour of the solution with different

definitions of progress variable. As pointed by G€oktolga et al. [112], the
studied FC combustion cases were more suited to have H2O and/or HO2
present in the definition of progress variable instead of carbon com-
pounds. The authors compared the DNS solution using detailed chemis-
try or FGM with different combinations of H2O and/or HO2 mass
fractions as progress variable. They concluded that it was not possible
to accurately model the reaction using a single progress variable, due to
the characteristics of pre-ignition and post-auto-ignition zones in this
FC case. The authors proposed a method to incorporate two progress
variables in the model, each of interest in a different part of the flame,
with a transition between them in the final model. Transport equations
of both were solved across the whole domain, and a threshold value
(maximum HO2 mass fraction) was established to make the transition
between the two pre-calculated lookup tables. This type of solution
demonstrates that based on a prior investigation, it is possible to create
a tabulated chemistry model able to cope with a qualitative change in
flame structure at an a priori unknown spatial position. This appears to
be an attractive feature from a design point of view. The application of
this approach has to be explored further.

4.5. RANS-based modelling

4.5.1. Early studies

Along with the early JHC experiments, many simulations were
carried out using the models already available for calculation of
canonical premixed and non-premixed flames. Especially the joint
scalar transported PDF models were employed as they are in principle
independent of the combustion regime. Their relatively high compu-
tational cost was not a severe constraint for the simple JHC configura-
tion as the geometry could be simplified to a 2D axisymmetric case in
RANS. Variations of PDF and EDC approaches along with RANS domi-
nated most of the works related to the JHC configuration in the past
15 years.

Cabra et al. [44] together with their experimental results presented
computational results on a comparison between a transported PDF
model and the EDC model using the k-e turbulence model. A Reynolds
stress model (RSM) for turbulence was also applied but only with the
EDC model. None of the approaches was able to replicate the experi-
mental data with a high degree of accuracy. Especially the OH mass
fraction showed major discrepancies. The comparison regarding mix-
ture fraction and O2 concentration extracted from point measurements
at radial stations suggested that the turbulence modelling had a signifi-
cant influence. The best results were obtained when using the RSM tur-
bulence model, as both PDF and EDC approaches with k-e showed large
disagreement. Further studying the behaviour of the PDF model in
these conditions, Masri et al. [128] assessed the use of the storage and
retrieval algorithm ISAT and the choice of the chemical reaction mech-
anism. The tolerance imposed in ISAT had a significant influence on
the results as well as on computational time, pointing to the need for
convergence studies.

Similarly to Cabra et al. [44], Christo and Dally [36] performed a
comparison between a PDF model, a flamelet-based model, EDM and
EDC, in an attempt to replicate the Adelaide burner results [34]. Using
EDM with three-step chemistry, different versions of the k-e model
were compared and using the value of 1.6 for the model constant Ce1
provided the best results. This comparison was made based on the
results of the mixture fraction field. Next, it was shown that EDM per-
forms best among the turbulence-chemistry interaction models. This
illustrates the difficulty, commonly encountered in turbulent reacting
flow studies, of attributing deviations to a given submodel. For example,
the calibration of a turbulence model could be sensitive to the chosen
turbulence-chemistry interaction model, and conclusions regarding
which model performs the best might be sensitive to the case studied.

Along with the experiments on the Cabra burner using CH4, Cabra
et al. [24] presented simulations using a PDF method. A comparison
between micromixing models was performed and the influence of

48

A.A.V. Perpignan et al. / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 69 (2018) 28(cid:1)62

such models was shown to be significant. The results showed that the
modified Curl micromixing model performed slightly better than
other common micromixing models. Interestingly, the effect of modi-
fying the chosen micromixing model was shown to be unimportant
for the Cabra burner H2 flame [129].

Using data from both the Adelaide burner and the DJHC, De and
Dongre [130] investigated the EDC, steady-flamelet with presumed-
PDF, and transported-PDF models. Additionally, micromixing models
were compared in detail. The comparison pointed to better predic-
tions by the Lagrangian transported PDF, along with either the EMST
(Euclidian Minimum Spanning Tree) or the IEM (Interaction by
Exchange with the Mean) mixing models. However, the authors
pointed to the need of providing the temperature fluctuations as a
boundary condition to enhance the accuracy. Whether or not this can
be done depends on the type of model and the completeness of
experimental information. Furthermore, the prediction of minor spe-
cies was relatively poor, representing a challenge for prediction of
pollutant formation (especially CO).

4.5.2. Application of EDC

The EDC model has been popular since the early works on JHC
flames. Comparisons were carried out in relation to turbulence mod-
els and chemical reaction mechanisms [131(cid:1)134]. The computational
costs are highly dependent on the chosen chemical mechanism, but
are usually lower than those of PDF-based models.

In several JHC cases, the standard EDC model was found to pre-
dict ignition far upstream, leading to a clear peak in the radial
mean temperature profile not present in the experiments. This is
not surprising as EDC by its definition in no way represents igni-
tion by separate local events (ignition kernels) responsible for the
ignition in many JHC flames. Nevertheless, several authors have
remedied the failure by paying more attention to the role of turbu-
lent boundary conditions and the role of differential diffusion or by

two model
parameters appear. The key model features are the volume fraction
of the reaction zones (g) and the residence time in these zones (t),
which are dependent on two constants, Ct and Cg respectively.
Aminian et al. [134] proposed adjusting the value of Ct. Similarly,
Evans et al. [138] investigated a range of values for the model con-
stants and recommended values for CH4/H2 and C2H4/H2 flames.
Both works were based on the Adelaide burner experiments and
showed improvement in relation to the standard constants.

Indeed,

the

values of the turbulent Re and Kolmogorov scale Da. They employed
the fuel jet as a reference for the Re calculation, while the method of
Isaac et al. [33] was used to calculate a global Da. Therefore such
approach requires a previous model solution in which the chemical
analysis can be performed in order to calculate Da. For the second
approach of calculating model constants locally, the turbulent Re was
calculated for each domain cell. However, the calculation of Da would
ideally require using the same method employed for the global
approach at each location. The method involves evaluating the Jaco-
bian of the chemical source term, and would be very expensive for
cell-based calculations. As a consequence, the authors opted for an
estimation of the chemical time-scales based on one-step chemistry
and the local conditions of temperature and concentration. Both
global and local approaches showed improved results in relation to
the standard EDC model.

Also employing the Adelaide JHC as a test case, Li et al. [141]
assessed the performance of EDC for varying parameters: formula-
tions of the EDC with respect to the mass fraction on the fine struc-
tures, EDC model constants, k-e model C1e constant, chemical
reaction mechanisms, assuming the fine structures to be PSRs or
PFRs, and including or not differential diffusion. While adjusting the
EDC and k-e constants have shown to affect the solutions, the other
parameters did not considerably influence it. The prediction of minor
species was still sub-optimal for all cases. Additionally, they per-
formed a comparison of EDC to a PaSR model, which notably per-
formed better in the prediction of NO.

Having the DJHC as test case, Bao [142] presented another formu-
lation of the EDC with locally determined constants. The difference in
relation to the model developed by Parente et al. [140] is on how the
laminar flame speed is calculated in order to evaluate the constants.
While Parente et al. [140] had Cg proportional to the square-root of
the Kolmogorov scale Da, Bao [142] derived a relationship in which
Cg is proportional to Da3/4. The temperature predictions were shown
to be superior in comparison to the formulation of Parente et al. [140]
for the chosen test case. Some of the results of Bao [142] are further
discussed in Section 4.8.

The improvement of the EDC model is promising if the calculation
of local constants can be made more consistently and at a low compu-
tational cost. All the aforementioned developments were performed
using RANS simulations and could possibly be validated using DNS or
transferred to LES.

The proposed changes of model constants in the EDC model were
not only purely empirical but were also motivated by the argument
that the FC combustion regime is different from the conditions for
which the EDC was formulated originally. Indeed, as pointed out by
Minamoto et al. [116] in their DNS study, the modification of EDC mod-
els can potentially take into account the increased volumes caused by
the different shapes of the reaction zones in the FC regime. This was in
corroboration with earlier findings, also pointed in the conclusions of
De and Dongre [130]. Being characterized by distributed reactions, FC
has Da close to unity, when calculated using the integral time-scale, as
discussed in Section 2 and shown in the diagrams of Fig. 4.

Recently, more comprehensive modifications were suggested.
Aminian et al. [139] proposed the modification of the extinction crite-
rion of the EDC model. They employed the PaSR (Partially Stirred
Reactor) concept to the fine scales instead of the PSR assumption. In
this approach, both a finite rate mixing process and a finite-rate
chemistry are taken into account. Therefore, the critical residence
time (which ultimately determines extinction) has different values as
it is dependent on the required time for chemistry within the fine
structures.

Parente et al. [140] compared two different approaches with the
Adelaide flames as test cases: global and local model constant evalua-
tion. For the first approach, the Ct and Cg were determined based on

4.5.3. Application of statistical models (CMC, CSE, PDF)

Kim et al. [143] were the first to apply the Conditional Momentum
Closure (CMC) model to FC flames. The CMC is a general modelling
approach that in principle is suitable for flames in all regimes. In this
approach, closure assumptions are made concerning the conditional
expectation values of thermochemical variables, conditional on val-
ues of a few key variables. The model allows its validity throughout
combustion regimes, as it has no a priori assumptions regarding tur-
bulent or chemical time or length-scales. This fact makes the
approach attractive for FC applications, given the complexity of the
regime characterisation. However, the number of investigations deal-
ing with CMC for FC is relatively low. This fact is possibly due to its
theoretical complexity in combination with the need to solve trans-
port equations in a space with the conditioning variables as extra
dimensions. Additionally, the associated computational costs are rela-
tively high, although being lower than transported PDF models with
similar chemistry [144].

The work of Kim et al. [143] showed results obtained for the three
cases explored during the first experiments with the Adelaide burner
[34]. Considering the fact that a RANS approach was adopted, the
results were consistent with the experimental observations. Even the
usual difficulty with the predictions of CO and NO profiles was over-
come and the simulation results had a reasonable agreement.

A.A.V. Perpignan et al. / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 69 (2018) 28(cid:1)62

49

A similar approach was used to simulate experiments with the
Cabra burner. Patwardhan et al. [145] compared their results to those
of transported-PDF [128]. The CMC approach showed slightly better
results while none of the models were good at predicting lift-off
heights. This could also be an artefact of the turbulence model, as
both combustion models employed only k-e model.

Sarras et al. [125] simulated the DJHC experiments for cases with
natural gas and a synthetic biogas as fuel using a transported-PDF
approach in combination with the extended FGM method using up to
four independent variables (two mixture fractions, a progress vari-
able and enthalpy deficit). The FGM was a means to reduce the high
computational cost usually associated with transported PDF methods.
A comparison between a 3D FGM (without enthalpy deficit) and a 4D
tabulation (with enthalpy deficit) was carried out. The progress vari-
able was based on CO2, H2O and H2 mass fractions. Additionally, the
authors investigated the effect of including effects of differential dif-
fusion. Agreement with the experimental data was achieved only
when the 4D approach with differential diffusion was considered.

Labahn et al. applied CSE to model the DJHC flames with natural
gas fuel in the frame of RANS [99] and LES [146]. Their approach
employed two mixture fractions as conditioning variables: the first
was the conventional mixture fraction and the second was a variable
representing at the same time the oxygen profile and temperature
(or enthalpy deficit profile) at the inflow boundary. Handling oxygen
and temperature profile with only one variable induces an approxi-
mation but was found to be effective. Chemistry was tabulated with
an approach called Trajectory Generated Low Dimension Manifold
(TGLDM), which was stored as a function of the two mixture fractions
and mass fractions of CO2 and H2O as progress variables. This RANS-
CSE approach was found to perform very well. Remaining discrepan-
cies were attributed to inaccuracies in the turbulent mixing due in
RANS. The RANS-CSE results of Labahn et al. [99] are included in the
comparative study presented in Section 4.8.

4.6. LES-based modelling

After the very first attempts to model JHC flames with RANS,
researchers employed LES. Kulkarni et al. [147] used an Eulerian formu-
lation of the transported PDF method (stochastic field method) along
with tabulated chemistry based on PSRs was. Later Bhaya et al. [148]
performed a comparison between a Lagrangian and an Eulerian formu-
lation (particle method versus moment method), along with the effect
of
two chemical reaction mechanisms and mixing models. The
Lagrangian approach was shown to be superior to the Eulerian, and, as
expected, the LES results were better than their RANS counterparts.

In the framework of LES, Domingo et al. [126] presented simulations
intended to reproduce experiments performed on the Cabra burner
[24]. Chemistry was tabulated using their approach combining auto-
ignition chemistry (using PSRs) and premixed flamelets in the tabula-
tion, described above. The results were fairly good. The largest devia-
tions in relation to experiments were present in intermediate species
and pollutants, as OH, CO and NO were not correctly predicted.

Using LES, Ihme et al. [121] applied the extended FPVA to the Ade-
laide JHC flames and compared to the usual approach (with only two
controlling variables). The results with three controlling variables
were superior, particularly in predicting CO. However, to achieve bet-
ter results for every measured variable, the mean values and the tur-
bulent intermittency of the three controlling variables imposed as
boundary conditions proved to be important and were optimized
based on the experimental results.

Possibly the best simulation results achieved so far related to
the DJHC experiments were achieved using CSE in combination
with LES [146]. This approach was able to capture most of the
features observed in the experiments, pointing to CSE and related
approaches as very promising. Compared to the RANS-CSE results
of [99], the peak temperatures and shape of the temperature

profiles were better captured in LES-CSE. The fact that tempera-
ture fluctuations were assumed absent in the inlet boundary con-
ditions was mentioned as an area for improvement. The LES-CSE
results of Labahn and Devaud [146] are included in the compara-
tive study presented in Section 4.8.

4.7. Chemical reactor networks

Application of a CRN to describe the reacting flow in a combustor
requires a definition of the network parameters (number and type of
reactors, mass flow rates and residence times). To provide these
parameters, insight on the flow field has to be used. The type of infor-
mation used can be derived from overall characteristics of flow pat-
terns such as expected presence of a recirculation zone or based on a
separate CFD simulation of the flow field, either inert or with simple
chemistry. Some works have focused on post-processing of CFD solu-
tions by splitting the computational domain according to certain crite-
ria to form a CRN. Detailed chemistry can then be employed in CRNs at
relatively low computational cost, while the same CRN can be used to
quickly simulate variation in operating conditions.

Within this framework, Frassoldati et al. [135] developed a
postprocessor for NOx prediction by building a CRN using the
same grid as the one employed in CFD simulation. The CFD was
done using a simple kinetic scheme and their detailed kinetic
mechanism (PolimiC1C3HT1201) was adopted to predict the NOx
formation. The tool was first applied to the Adelaide burner with
CH4/H2 as fuel. The approach was further developed by using the
splitting criteria based on temperature and species concentra-
tions to build CRNs with lower number of reactors [149]. Their
method included a correction to the temperature due to turbu-
lence interaction (based on the temperature variance)
that
should be available from the CFD solution. In addition to this
imperfect mixing was represented by considering a fraction of
the PSRs as inert. The volume of reacting portion was deter-
mined by the estimated volume of the fine structures, calculated
based on local turbulence parameters. This clearly comes close to
the procedure used in the EDC model. The authors compared
their results with experimental data from laboratory flames and
also to the experiments performed by Veríssimo et al. [78]. The
predictions of CO and NO showed deviations from experimental
data, which were attributed to the insufficient accuracy in the
mean temperature prediction.

In conclusion, both mean and variance of temperature should be
correctly predicted before the CRN NOx post-processor can give accu-
rate predictions. Because of the dilution and strong mixing in FC con-
ditions the level of temperature fluctuations is not so strong and
simple variance models would be sufficient. However, more compari-
sons and validation should be accomplished using experimental data
to come to clear conclusions on the way to represent the role of tem-
perature fluctuations in the CRN approach. Furthermore,
in the
approach using a reactor associated with clusters of CFD cells, the cri-
teria for clustering the CFD cells and the use of information contained
in the CFD simulations should be optimized.

4.8. Modelling comparison of a DJHC flame

The JHC experiments discussed in Section 3.1 have served as
canonical test bench for model validation. In this section we present
results for the DJHC-I flame [46,54], coming from different research
groups. A representative set of modelling approaches to date was
selected in order to showcase their capabilities.

The modelling approaches compared in this section are listed in
Table 4. They comprise EDC with RANS [142], CSE with RANS or LES
[99,146] and an FGM-method using “diluted air” flamelets (DA-FGM)
with RANS or LES [121,122]. This DA-FGM model builds the FGM from
non-premixed flamelets diluted at the air boundary with a diluent

which is defined as products of stoichiometric combustion[146] and
differs from the approaches proposed in [118(cid:1)120]. The EDC with
RANS cases presented here are taken from [137] and comprise stan-
dard EDC with either k-e or Reynolds Stress Model (RSM) and an EDC
with local modified model constants (here abbreviated to as “local
parameters”: EDC-LP. In the following some key aspects of the base
case DJHC flame are discussed via a comparison of the relative perfor-
mance of the models. Results are presented in Figs. 20(cid:1)24.

4.8.1. Velocity predictions

The prediction of the radial profile of axial velocity (Fig. 20) is gen-
erally good for all the approaches. The differences are related to the
well-known problem of predicting the spreading rate of a round jet in
RANS and the influence of temperature prediction on the density.

On the other hand, the agreement between model and experiment
in the profile of radial velocity (Fig. 21) is not good close to the
burner. This might be explained by a bias in the experimental results
due to an unequal density of seeding particles in the fuel jet com-
pared to the coflow, leading to an underestimation of the radial
spreading close to the nozzle. However, the experimental paper of
Oldenhof [46] explains that careful attention was paid to the equal
seeding density of fuel and oxidiser.

Further downstream (x = 90 mm) the CSE-LES prediction deviates
significantly from other model predictions and from the experiments.

This might be due to insufficient averaging time for constructing the
mean values.

4.8.2. Temperature predictions

A key problem in the prediction of mean radial temperature pro-
files is the identification of the height at which the ignition is suffi-
ciently strong to significantly affect the mean temperature. In the
experiments, the presence of ignition kernels (detected via their
chemiluminescence) affected only the high temperature tail of the
temperature PDF (measured using CARS) and did not have significant
effect on the mean profile. The EDC model in combination with stan-
dard k-e tends to over predict the ignition and lead to a clearly visible
peak in the radial temperature profile already at x = 30 mm, which
becomes clearer at x = 60 mm (Fig. 22). Choosing the Reynolds Stress
Model (RSM) instead of k-e does not eliminate the early temperature
peak but predicts its position closer to the centreline in agreement
with the prediction of a smaller spreading rate of the cylindrical jet.
The more elaborate EDC model with local parameters (EDC-LP), as
discussed in Section 4.5.2, does lead to a prediction without a too
early peak.

The conditional source term estimation (CSE) model in combination
with RANS gives a lower peak. The CSE in combination with LES and
the DA-FGM give no peak, as shown in Fig. 23. The agreement between
model predictions and experiments for mean temperature in the core

of the coflow is not as good at x = 60 mm as it is at x = 30 mm. This is
rather caused by a shift in the temperature level of the experimental
results than caused by recognisable model features. All models assume
a coflow in chemical equilibrium at the outlet of the coflow annulus,
but the evolution of the experimental profiles shows an increase
between x = 15 mm and 30 mm which tend to indicate a heat release
effect not compatible with the equilibrium assumption made in the
model calculations. The differences in predicted temperature can partly
be explained by the different ways in which experimental information
on mean oxygen profile is converted into the model boundary condi-
tions employing mixture fractions and/or a dilution variable.

Laboratory air is entrained at the outer edge of the coflow
leading to reduction of
the mean temperature. The rate of
entrainment depends on the boundary conditions in the air
region. At the inlet the laboratory air should be given a low

nonzero axial velocity in order to properly describe the entrain-
ment of stagnant air into the coflow stream. In the CSE approach
the air inlet velocity was set to 0.5 m/s which led to the best
results. On the other hand, the mean temperature at the centre-
line at axial distance 60 mm and 120 mm is better predicted by
the RANS approaches compared to the LES approaches.

The experimental radial profile of temperature standard deviation
at x = 15 mm (Fig. 24) is flat and more than 100 K, similar to what is
present in the measured profile at x = 3 mm (not shown). None of the
models presented here has taken this initial level of temperature fluc-
tuations into account or is able to predict the initial development of
temperature rms correctly (See Sarras et al. [125] for a simulation
including the temperature rms profile as a boundary condition at the
inlet). Nevertheless, the increase in temperature rms due to the pres-
ence of the mixing layers between fuel and coflow and between

coflow and air is predicted in agreement with the experiments by
both CSE and DA-FGM.

We can conclude that the reviewed simulations of the DJHC
base allow the identification of the key aspects to be taken into
account to reach agreement with the experiment: jet spreading
rate, ignition delay, and entrainment. The available DJHC database
contains cases with different Re, coflow composition and temper-
ature and allow for further analysis to identify whether the mod-
els also capture all trends correctly. A deeper understanding of
the differences between the predictions of CSE and FGM
approaches could be achieved by extending the comparison to
the probability density function of temperature as done by Sarras
et al. [120].

4.9. Conclusions and future outlook for computational models

The review and discussions provided above are concerned about
simulations of FC in canonical configurations and lab-scale experi-
ments. In this section we comment on which models perform best
and in which directions more efforts are needed. Next, we make an
attempt to formulate recommendations towards computation model-
ling in support of designing new combustors.

As has been explained, several types of models, based on widely
different (and occasionally contradictory) assumptions have been
employed to simulate FC and numerous authors reported to have
been successful in reproducing experimental data. For several rea-
sons, the reported success of a given model does not necessarily
make it recommendable for all cases related to FC. The final evalua-
tion is sometimes difficult due to the lack of consistency in the defini-

tion of FC. Additionally, the results reported have not been bench-
marked to a specific level of accuracy, and are thus subjective.

The following conclusions and recommendations can be made:

(cid:4) Possibly, the most used turbulence-chemistry interaction model
is the EDC, due to its availability in commercial codes, its long
standing tradition in the field, and the possibility of using diverse
chemical reaction mechanisms. The EDC with suitable model
constant calibration, as already has been attempted [139(cid:1)142],
is relatively straightforward to use and reasonably accurate. If a
robust and flexible modification of the model can be developed,
this model can become even more popular.

(cid:4) Tabulated chemistry models, especially FGM, are attractive because
they are computationally efficient and can be relatively easily
extended with a model for turbulent fluctuations (presumed PDF).
But to be accurate, it is necessary that the applicable local flame
structure and the related progress and control variables can be
determined for a given case with little a priori information. How-
ever, one must be aware that the flamelet structure ceases to exist
or at least is strongly affected in FC applications.

(cid:4) CMC/CSE approaches seem to offer optimal combined represen-
tation of chemistry and turbulent fluctuations at (just) affordable
cost. Given the high quality of the reported results, they can
become popular if the knowledge on their implementation and
operation spreads and if further investigations confirm their
good performance.

(cid:4) It can be effective to use a different modelling approach for the
predictions of flow and heat release, and the predictions of emis-
sions. The CRNs are attractive for predicting emissions, especially
in situations where the role of fluctuations is low or easy to rep-
resent. Under FC conditions, due to the characteristics of the
regime (lower temperature and species gradients), this seems to
be the case. The development of recommended strategies for
clustering CFD domain cells into the idealised reactors that form
the CRNs might help in the handling of practical flow configura-
tions in a sufficiently accurate way.

An important question is whether it is worth using LES instead of
RANS. The more complex the flow field, the more one can expect a
clear benefit from LES. Until now the use of LES related to the design
attempts is not common, although there are exceptions [151]. This is
mainly due to its larger computational cost, which is aggravated by
the higher complexity in the geometries. Therefore for several design
studies where multiple simulations are needed, the RANS approach
will be preferred. Additionally, RANS approaches may be sufficiently
accurate (as shown in Section 4.8). It should be stressed though that
the usual difficulties in predicting the intermediate species are closely
related to the influence of turbulent fluctuations [152]. Using suffi-
ciently resolved LES, the sensitivity to different choices of turbulence-
chemistry interaction model will be smaller because the modelling
only concerns the subgrid scale phenomena.

5. Conceptual designs for gas turbine FC combustors

A number of concepts and designs of Flameless combustors for gas
turbines have been proposed, simulated or tested. The lessons

learned through these attempts are key to the possible success of
future designs. This section presents the most relevant aspects and
findings of the previous design attempts.

In contrast with industrial furnaces, there is no easy solution for
preheating and diluting the reactants in a gas turbine combustor. The
design is far more challenging because:

(cid:4) Gas turbines usually operate with an overall equivalence ratio
of 0.3(cid:1)0.4 close to peak power settings, which hinders the
reduction of O2 concentration in the recirculated combustion
products.

(cid:4) The heat density (thermal energy density) of gas turbine combus-
tors is an order of magnitude greater than that of industrial fur-
naces and this hinders the application of FC to gas turbines. This
is especially true for aero engines as aircraft performance is sensi-
tive to any increase in the volume and weight of the propulsion
system.

(cid:4) Unlike in most furnaces, the gas turbine combustor is adiabatic,
which means that the recirculated combustion products are at a
high temperature. This can become a problem when increasing
the recirculation ratio as the temperature after mixing of incom-
ing fresh mixture and recirculated combustion products can
reach significantly higher temperature than the auto-ignition
temperature, which can increase the NOx emission from the
combustor.

(cid:4) Pressure losses due to the recirculation in the combustor can

degrade the gas turbine efficiency.

It is worth highlighting the differences in the requirements
between aero engines and land-based gas turbines. The latter has less
restrictions in terms of combustor volume and weight, and no
requirement for re-light capabilities. Additional restrictions could be
imposed due to cycle differences (recuperation or intercooling, for
example)[153]. Other differences are the possibility of having exter-
nal recirculation (EGR) in land-based gas turbines, which may have a
major impact on design constraints and strategies, and their usual
longer residence times [154]. Until recently, land-based gas turbines
required narrower operational range. However, as mentioned in Sec-
tion 1, gas turbines shall be employed along with renewable energy
sources to cope with the inherent intermittency of solar and wind
energy. Therefore, the gas turbine operation will have to be more
flexible. The main differences between the requirements of land-
based gas turbines and aero engines are summarized in Table 5.

The FC-based combustor design attempts for gas turbines often
rely on the internal recirculation of combustion products. Mixing air
with combustion products is an obvious solution as it increases tem-
perature of the reactants and reduces O2 concentration. The challenge
is in designing a combustor that is able to promote mixing at the
required rates without excessive pressure losses and within the lim-
ited available volume.

The requirements for operational range in aero engines is one of
the main challenges for combustor design, and that is also the case
for FC application. The attainment of low emissions while maintain-
ing stability at part-load conditions is crucial. However, this joint
requirement has not been extensively evaluated for most design con-
cepts herein reviewed. This is partly explained by the fact FC-based

with optical access and was operated at 20 bar. Using natural gas as
fuel they concluded that the low emission range (for both CO and NOx)
was extended with increasing jet velocity (shown in Fig. 25), which
influenced the mixing behaviour. This fact points to issues regarding
pressure losses, which increase with jet momentum.

Additionally, the operational range was relatively narrow. The
reported variation in equivalence ratio is shown in Fig. 25 as well. The
behaviour of emissions with varying excess air ratio was usual: increas-
ingly leaner mixtures yielded lower NOx and higher CO emissions.
These results are in contrast with those of Veríssimo et al. [78], dis-
cussed in Section 3.1. Although the geometries of L€uckerath et al. [163]
and Veríssimo et al. [78] share similarities, the latter was non-premixed,
while the former had a significant level of premixedness. Essentially,
L€uckerath et al. [163] pointed out that the largest difficulties of the
FLOX(cid:1) concept for gas turbine conditions are emissions and operational
range. Instabilities and flame blow-offs took place while altering the
equivalence ratio and power in settings that would be required for a
gas turbine operation. In most enclosed systems the rate of recirculation
almost solely depends on the jet momentum which relates to the jet
diameter and the heat capacity of the system. Hence, these systems end
up having a limited operational range. Duwig et al. [151] also pointed
to the problem of narrow operational range, while estimating the
required amount of recirculated products to be approximately the same
as the incoming reactants in order to sustain FC.

Lammel et al. [164] tackled the problem of having low power den-
sities in FLOX(cid:1) by increasing the diameter of the fuel nozzle to allow
more fuel. However, this led to stability problems and higher emis-
sions as the partial premixing was impaired. The burners were then
redesigned to a configuration with air surrounding the fuel nozzle.
The reactants further mixed in mixing tubes before entering the
chamber. This design was named HiPerMix(cid:1). The authors experimen-
tally analysed the performance of the design from 5 to 7 bar, using OH
chemiluminescence, temperature and velocity measurements, as well
as flue gas concentrations. The fuels tested were natural gas, natural
gas-H2 mixture, and natural gas-C3H8 mixture.

Lammel et al. [164]pointed that the temperature fields displayed
inhomogeneity due to the mixing characteristics of the HiPerMix(cid:1). Fur-
ther improving the mixing would increase pressure losses to undesir-
able levels. Nevertheless, they showed that low NOx emissions were
low (< 10 ppm) for the cases in which peak local temperatures were
below the global adiabatic flame temperature. In practice, these condi-
tions were translated to equivalence ratios lower than approximately
0.6, as their analysis maintained oxidiser mass flows and varied fuel
input. For low equivalence ratios local temperatures were less likely to
reach temperatures close to the global adiabatic flame temperature.
This was probably due to the mixing characteristics of the design. This
work showcased the compromise between mixing, pressure loss and
emissions using the FLOX(cid:1) concept. However, more detailed studies are
still required in order to develop this concept, as the results are not gen-
eralized easily.

combustors are still in an early stage of development. On the other
hand, it will become clear that the success of design concepts would
be more likely if such central issues would be addressed already from
the conceptualization phase.

The adopted strategies to recirculate gases internally within the
combustion chamber are: (i) recirculation induced by jet momentum
and (ii) recirculation induced by geometry. In the first category, the
FLOX(cid:1) type combustors have been proposed and are primarily derived
from industrial burners. These burners rely on high momentum jets to
promote recirculation and the mixing between oxidiser, fuel and com-
bustion products. Combustors with FLOX(cid:1) burners oriented to gas tur-
bine applications were tested and simulated with different approaches.
In the FLOX(cid:1) burners, the fuel is injected through radially distributed
nozzles in a pre-chamber section, where it is partially premixed with the
oxidiser stream. Both fuel and oxidiser promptly enter the combustion
chamber via larger nozzles, positioned in the same axes as the fuel noz-
zles (Fig. 26). This concept was first developed for gaseous fuels. The
axial distance between the fuel nozzles and the main nozzles (through
which both air and fuel enter the combustion chamber) determines the
premixedness. The radial position of the nozzles is related to mixing
behaviour inside the chamber and, consequently to the chamber vol-
ume, which determines the intended energy density of the combustor.
However, these design parameters were never openly discussed in liter-
ature and their effect on performance is not precisely known.

L€uckerath et al. [163] presented one of the first investigations
regarding the adaptation of the FLOX(cid:1) concept to gas turbines. A
FLOX(cid:1) burner with 12 nozzles was adapted to a combustion chamber

Fig. 26. FLOX(cid:1) combustor employed by Sadanandan et al. [165] and the two nozzle configurations.

similar to a conventional combustor. The authors reported that a
good operational range and relatively low NOx emissions was
obtained. They suggested that CO could be reduced further by opti-
mizing the split between the swirler burner and the FLOX(cid:1). These
results were achieved in an atmospheric pressure test rig and
requires further testing, especially with respect to the complexity
involved in fuel splitting. This concept shares similarities with the
design studied by Guillou et al. [169] in which the oxidiser was
injected through a swirler positioned at the centre of the burner,
while the fuel jets were displaced radially and injected tangentially in
order to increase the swirling motion.

These concepts [166(cid:1)169] are examples of how the FLOX(cid:1)
approach could incorporate solutions to broaden the operational
ranges similarly to pilots employed in modern lean-premixed com-
bustors. These candidate solutions must also be evaluated with
respect
to emissions, as low emissions should be maintained
throughout the whole LTO cycle for aero engines.

The FLOX(cid:1) combustors are primarily suited for gaseous fuels. Using
liquid fuels would require a different architecture as the fuel jet momen-
tum and evaporation play an important role in the partial premixing,
which is essential for this type of combustors. Attempting to overcome
this limitation, Zizin et al. [170] tested possible configurations and
designs that would allow the use of liquid fuels. Different atomizers and
nozzles were tested for a single-nozzle and a 12-nozzle configuration
with diesel, light heating oil and kerosene fuels. The authors reported no
clear advantage of one configuration over the others.

Gounder et al. [171] further developed the study performed by
Zizin et al. [170] and performed measurements in a 8-nozzle square-
shaped combustor (shown in Fig. 28) intended for a micro gas tur-
bine. The authors mentioned that the spray atomizers could be easily
incorporated in large FLOX(cid:1) gas turbines due to the large ratio
between air nozzle diameter and atomizer diameter. However, the
usual difficulties faced in previous works with gaseous fuels were still
present.

Apart from the above mentioned difficulties, the applicability of
FLOX(cid:1) based gas turbine combustors is still uncertain. The integration
of an FC combustor within a gas turbine has not been discussed in
detail by researchers, especially for aero engines, which use annular
type combustion chambers.

Other experimental variations relying on jet-mixing are present in
the literature. The architectures of such concepts were summarized by
Arghode and Gupta [173], with variations being mostly in the relative
positions of oxidiser jets, fuel jets, and exhaust. The overall difficulties
and strategies to tackle them in such concepts are similar to those pre-
sented for the FLOX(cid:1) configuration. Along with their summary, the
authors explored the challenge of achieving high energy density inside
the combustors, an important requirement of gas turbine engines.

Examining the works mentioned in this section, the gap in relation
to the basic experiments (Section 3) is evident. For example, formal-
dehyde (CH2O) was not measured in realistic setups, while its role
was shown to be of great importance. A better correspondence
between canonical and applied experiments would also be of great
value to discuss the FC regime itself and to check the validity of fun-
damental experimental conditions to applications.The most impor-
tant experiments are summarized in Table 6.

The designs with recirculation induced by jet momentum were
studied in more detail than those based in primary flow recirculation
and the difficulties with operational range, combustion efficiency and
engine integration are still significant obstacles. Attempting to bridge
the gap between designs and basic experiments in combustors based
on jet momentum, a single-nozzle premixed burner in a non-sym-
metrical combustion chamber was designed to represent one of the
nozzles found in the FLOX(cid:1) concept. An early work provided data on
OH, OH* and velocity fields [174], being useful for model validation,
while a study on jet-flapping was presented using the same measure-
ment techniques [175].

Fig. 27. The configurations of the partially premixed nozzles studied by Sch€utz et al.
[166] in the EZEE(cid:1) concept.

In the experiments described by Lammel et al. [164] different
fuels were compared based on their NOx emission characteristics.
Sadanandan et al. [165] further investigated the effect of
fuel
composition using a preceding FLOX(cid:1) combustor operating at
20 bar to determine the effect of H2 addition to natural gas in var-
ious proportions while maintaining the thermal power. Addition-
ally, two types of nozzles were tested: partially premixed, with a
fixed axial distance between fuel inlet and combustion chamber
inlet, and non-premixed, with fuel and air entering at the same
plane directly in the combustion chamber (Fig. 26). Once again,
the addition of H2 increased the levels of NOx emissions and
moved the reactions upstream because of higher reactivity. Thus,
such addition should be followed by adaptations in the jet veloci-
ties. In turn, the effect of having partial or no premixing on emis-
sions was minor as compared to the recirculation ratio (for a
given equivalence ratio). Emissions were lower for higher recircu-
lation ratios, achieved by higher jet velocities.

As narrow operational range is a common problem faced by
FLOX(cid:1) based combustors, the EZEE(cid:1) configuration was developed
[166] in an attempt to improve the operational range of the high
energy density HiPerMix(cid:1) design. The design retained the 12 inlets to
the combustion chamber as in previous designs, but each of the pre-
mixing tubes was fed by two fuel nozzles placed in the same plane
and radial coordinate. These fuel nozzles were tested both in centric
and excentric configurations, as shown in Fig. 27. The idea was to
extend the power modulation by regulating the fuel distribution
between the nozzles. The fuel partitioning was able to enhance the
operational range using natural gas and was regarded as satisfactory
by the authors.

Yet another attempt using a modified FLOX(cid:1) design was explored
by Roediger et al. [167] and Zanger et al. [168]. The idea was to have a
staged combustion with a swirler-stabilized flame in the centre of the
combustor, upstream of the axial position at which the usual concen-
tric FLOX(cid:1) jets were positioned. It is worth highlighting the relevance
of the experiments done with JHC discussed in Section 3.1 for config-
urations intended to employ staged combustion, as the (fuel) jets are
injected in a vitiated environment. Such architecture provides more
freedom to extend the operational range and stability as the core is

Interestingly, the setup was employed to study the combustion
regimes by varying the jet velocity [176]. With increasing velocity,
transitions from laminar premixed flames to turbulent premixed jets
that could not be stabilized occurred. Further increase in the jet
velocity caused flame stabilization possibly due to the increase in
recirculation, with evidence of auto-ignition kernels. The authors sug-
gested that the no-flame region corresponds to jet velocities higher
than the flame propagation velocity and too low to cause enough
recirculation. Furthermore, the authors estimated positions of the
investigated conditions on the Borghi diagram. They pointed that the
flames with the lowest jet velocities populated the laminar flame
region. A gradual increase in velocity made the flames unstable until
velocities were high enough to achieve stable combustion through
recirculation, and the flames populated the corrugated flamelet and
thin reaction zone regions of the diagram (see Fig. 4). Although the
methodology to calculate Ka and Da is arguable (as discussed in Sec-
tion 2), it is certainly valuable to relate the fundamentals of the FC
regime with an experiment similar to an application. Therefore, this
type of experiment shall provide better understanding and modelling
databases for the relevant conditions of FC applications.

As previously mentioned, another possible strategy to attain FC in
gas turbines is to impose a large recirculation to the primary flow.
This strategy was adopted by the FLOXCOM combustor [177(cid:1)181].
The authors were able to define a preliminary geometry as well as
some key design parameters like air split, recirculation ratio and the
temperatures of the different streams. By means of a CRN analysis,
Levy et al. [179] pointed out that increasing recirculation ratio (condi-
tion necessary to attain FC using this concept) could have negative
impact on CO emissions. This trend was later confirmed by Melo et al.
idea of the design was the generation of a
[180]. The central
large recirculation zone inside the combustor and to have the fuel

injected in a region where the incoming air is already mixed with
combustion products. Such design would allow the combustor to be
annular and would therefore be easier to integrate into an engine.
The concept was developed into a prototype [180].

The experiments performed by Melo et al. [180] employed 60°
sectors of the annular concept as shown in Fig. 29. They investi-
gated different configurations of air inlets (using slots or holes in
different angles) while retaining fuel injection and key geometri-
cal features. The cold flow recirculation ratios, as well as emis-
sions for a range of equivalence ratios for different configurations
were compared. Recirculation ratios and emissions showed signif-
icant sensitivity to the air inlet design. However, there was no
assessment in terms of pressure losses, an important parameter
for the application to gas turbines.

In another work, Melo et al. [181] focused on velocity and turbu-
lent kinetic energy distributions on different conditions in relation to
power input for one of the air inlet configurations previously studied
(Melo et al. [180]). Additionally, point measurements of temperature
and main species were performed inside the combustor using probes.
The authors identified relatively uniform temperature profiles, sug-
gesting attainment of the FC regime. In both works, the experiments
confirmed low NOx emissions, while the attained combustion effi-
ciencies and CO emissions were not at acceptable levels. The authors
suspected that the residence times within the combustion zone were
too low and could be improved by changing dimensions or fuel injec-
tion location. Therefore, it is yet to be proven if the concept is able to
attain high combustion efficiencies, broad operational range and low
pressure losses. Furthermore, the FLOXCOM concept would require
further tests in high pressure environment and possibly using liquid
fuels.

Most of the proposed designs did not include aspects related to
the integration in the gas turbine or modifications on the engine
architecture strategies that would contribute to a successful design.
The concept of staged combustion with turbine stages in between
was explored by Joos et al. [185], as early as 1996, but with no focus
on FC. Already pointed as a solution for reduction of NOx emissions,
the authors reported on aspects of the design development of the
ABB GT24 and GT26 design family, especially related to performance
and emissions. Interestingly, the concept was presented in the review
of Cavaliere and de Joannon [14] as one of the options to achieve FC
in gas turbines. Nevertheless, it was largely ignored in open literature
for a long time.

Recently, the hybrid engine concept presented within the AHEAD
project [186] employed a similar approach for aero engines. The project
explored advantages and challenges of using cryogenic fuels in avia-
tion, and proposed a multi-fuel blended wing body aircraft as a possi-
ble solution. The engine was conceptualised to have two sequential
combustors separated by a turbine section as shown in Fig. 32. The first
combustor would burn cryogenic fuels (natural gas or H2), while the
second combustor, referred to as Inter-turbine Burner (ITB), would
operate with Jet-A or biofuel under the FC regime.

The advantage of this strategy from a combustion point of view is
that the gases entering the second combustor would have high tem-
perature and reduced O2 concentration. Such conditions would facili-
tate the attainment of the FC regime with lower recirculation thereby
reducing the required volume and pressure losses. Additionally, the
possibility of regulating the power in each combustion chamber could
provide broader operational range if explored wisely [187].

The preliminary design of the ITB was presented by Levy et al.
[188], and was based on chemical kinetics and CFD analysis. The
authors were able to design the combustor and estimate emission
values. The annular FC combustor would split the incoming vitiated
oxidiser into the dilution and the combustion streams. The latter
would enter a large recirculation zone where fuel is injected. The
design of the ITB was evaluated by a comparison between experimen-
tal data on NOx and CO emissions with CFD and CRN simulations by
[189]. The authors identified opportunities to
Perpignan et al.
improve the design and elaborated on the NOx formation pathways.
Interestingly, the prompt pathway was shown to be dominant in the
overall NOx formation, while the thermal pathway had relatively lit-
tle contribution. This finding is related to the main reason why FC
yields lower NOx emissions: abatement of the thermal pathway.
However, a shift in the NOx formation chemistry due to the abun-
dance of combustion products in the reaction zones is also an impor-
tant factor.

Overall, the experimental assessment of concepts based on large
recirculation zones is difficult due to their predominantly annular

Fig. 29. Cross section of the 60° sector employed by Melo et al. [181].

On a more conceptual level, Levy et al. [182,183] studied the idea
of having smaller recirculation zones where fuel would be injected.
According to the analysis performed with the aid of CRNs, having
a smaller portion of the gases being recirculated to generate local
low O2 regions could reach a compromise between achieving FC
and the pressure losses causes by recirculation. The concept
(Fig. 30) also explored imposing heat transfer to the secondary air
flow, which would allow combustion to take place at near-stoi-
chiometric conditions without excessive temperature increase. In
principle, such solution could improve stability and broaden the
operational range, one of the largest concerns faced by the FLOX(cid:1)
concept. However, a proof of concept is required to back the pre-
liminary analyses performed.

A more recent concept relying on a large recirculation zone was
presented by Levy et al. [184], and was referred to as FOGT (Flameless
Oxidation Gas Turbine) combustor. The authors employed the same
analyses developed by Levy et al. [174(cid:1)179], but developed a different
geometry as compared to the FLOXCOM (Fig. 31). The central idea was
to have an annulus with a recirculation zone and the outlet in a direc-
tion opposite to the air inlet, thereby forcing mixing with burnt gases.
The authors proposed the fuel injection to be either along with the air
inlet, or inside the recirculation zone.

The computational analysis performed using CFD showed promis-
ing results in terms of emissions and pressure losses. However, the
concept requires a rigorous experimental analysis involving conven-
tional fuels and assessment of the operational range. Additionally, the
integrational aspects within the engine should be looked into.

configuration, which limits diagnostics and makes the use of proto-
types challenging. Therefore, the current trend is that these concepts
are being explored with available numerical tools. Designs with recir-
culation induced by geometry require more exploration, especially in
relation to experiments. The design of experiments able to simplify
the analyses while being representative of the phenomena involved
should be pursued.

6. Conclusions, open challenges and recommendations

This paper reviewed several studies directly related to FC in gas
turbines. The study of this subject has multiple levels, ranging from
the definition of FC to canonical experiments and modelling to design
attempts for gas turbine combustors.

The generalization of results or their classification is currently
impaired by the different and uncomprehensive definitions of FC. The
lack of a broadly accepted definition limits the effectiveness of
research, as results cannot be easily correlated.

The conclusions and recommendations of this review are summa-

rized below.

Concerning the definition of FC:

(cid:4) Existing definitions of FC are based on global parameters. How-
ever, because the regime is a result of local conditions, it is diffi-
cult to qualify it solely based on global parameters.

(cid:4) As far as the development of applications is concerned, pollutant
emissions could be incorporated in the definition of the FC
regime boundaries, as it is the reason to explore the FC regime.
However, as mentioned in Section 2, a definition based on pollut-
ant emissions would not be physically consistent.

Concerning basic experimental investigations:

(cid:4) Most of the fundamental experiments have been dedicated to
JHC. Although the configuration has several advantages and has
evolved to provide comprehensive databases, different test cases

have to be developed to support the developments for applica-
tions in gas turbines, especially for design concepts relying on
large recirculation zones.

(cid:4) Fundamental experiments should be developed to include pollut-

ant formation diagnostics and high operating pressures.

Concerning computational modelling:

(cid:4) DNS studies have shown that reaction zones in the FC regime con-
sists of thin reaction zones, intensely interacting with each other,
and are not completely homogeneous. Although some experiments
have shown similar behaviour [75],
it remains to be further
explored experimentally as the scales investigated in DNS are con-
siderably smaller than those of experimental investigations.

(cid:4) Virtually every turbulence-chemistry and combustion modelling
approach has been attempted for FC related problems. As far as
JHC data is concerned, the best results were obtained using CMC
and CSE. Recent adaptations and improvements in the EDC and
flamelet-based models also show promising results.

(cid:4) Even though computationally expensive, the evidenced importance
of unsteady structures point to the an advantage of LES-based
modelling to accurately capture the ignition and the extinction pro-
cesses, resulting in better intermediate species predictions.

(cid:4) The conclusions from JHC modelling should be extrapolated care-
fully as these experiments are not a good representation for all FC
related applications.

(cid:4) Modelling is still unreliable in terms of predicting emissions and
intermediate species. This is one the main impediments of using
numerical models in designing gas turbine combustors.

of the phenomena involved. This fact does not mean that a design is
not possible, since similar situations are common in engineering
practices. Full understanding is not a requirement for an engineering
product.

However, we understand that the current difficulties can be tack-
led by studying key features of the FC regime, namely reaction zone
structures, influence of local Damk€ohler and Karlovitz numbers, role
of heat transfer and higher pressures, and emissions formation. There
is a lack of experiments combining pollutant related chemistry data
and reaction zone structures. Progress in these areas will ultimately
lead to more effective design strategies, that will remain effective
also when transitions to power and propulsion technologies with
lower CO2 footprint are made.

Concerning conceptual designs for gas turbines:

November 2016.

(cid:4) The current concepts attempting to design a FC combustor for gas
turbines rely on recirculation created either by jet entrainment, a
large recirculation zone, or a combination of both. The former
method might be limited in operating flexibility as the recircula-
tion is directly proportional to the jets momenta.

(cid:4) Data available from experiments performed on combustors oper-
ating in the FC regime is scarce. High pressure experiments and
the use of advanced diagnostic techniques should be pursued to
increase our understanding.

(cid:4) Most designs failed mainly because of low combustion efficiency
(high CO emissions), higher pressure loss, narrow operational
range, higher complexity, or unfeasibility of integration in the
engine.

(cid:4) The full required operational envelope should be considered in
the development of FC-based designs. The attainment of low
emissions should be guaranteed also for part-load operation.
(cid:4) The integration of combustor concepts within engines is usually
neglected and should be considered in the early stages of the
design in order to increase its feasibility.

(cid:4) Systematic investigation regarding acoustic oscillations and sta-
bility should be performed in the framework of FC, as there is a
lack of studies in this area, which prevents designers from taking
advantage of the regime in that respect.

(cid:4) The exploration of innovative engine architectures may pave the
ground to the successful attainment of FC in gas turbines, as
shown by the use of an inter-turbine burner.

(cid:4) Staged combustion could be a possible way of reducing O2 con-

centration to facilitate FC in practical combustion systems.

(cid:4) If the level of development for FC-based designs allows, compari-
sons with other approaches should be performed to either justify
or disprove the design.

We can conclude that the designers of a gas turbine engine oper-
ating in the FC regime currently cannot rely on the full understanding

Dirk Roekaerts is a Full Professor in the Faculty of Mechani-
cal, Maritime and Materials Engineering at Delft University
of Technology (TU Delft) since 2005 and in the department
of Mechanical Engineering at Eindhoven University of Tech-
nology (TU/e) since 2016. His research aims to develop and
validate accurate computational models of combustion pro-
cesses and more generally concerns reactive flows with
phase change and heat transfer as occurring in many energy
applications. Prof. dr. Dirk Roekaerts obtained his PhD in
Theoretical Physics from Katholieke Universiteit Leuven in
Belgium in 1981. Next, during his civil service, he was
responsible for organization of activities on ‘Science, Tech-
nology and Society’. As a Postdoc Researcher at the Univer-
sities of Essen, Germany, and Leuven, Belgium, he went on to investigate links
between nonlinear phenomena, supersymmetry and stochastic processes. From 1987
to 2005 he was a Research Physicist at the Shell Research and Technology Centre in
Amsterdam, investigating complex flows in industrial equipment such as furnaces,
gasifiers and chemical reactors. From 1991 until 2005 he was part-time professor at
TU Delft.
