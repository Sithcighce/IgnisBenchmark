    "question_text": "Based on the paper by Sallam et al. [58], what distinguishes the turbulent breakup regime from the aerodynamic breakup regime in a fully turbulent liquid jet within a gaseous crossflow, and how is the transition between these two regimes characterized using the parameter We_LΛ q^(1/3)? Include the specific visual characteristics and physical manifestations that differentiate these regimes according to the cited work.",
    "standard_answer": "According to Sallam et al. [58], the breakup of a fully turbulent liquid jet in a gaseous crossflow is classified into two major regimes: the aerodynamic breakup regime and the turbulent breakup regime. The aerodynamic breakup regime includes column, bag, multimode, and shear breakup, which appears similar in appearance to the breakup of a non-turbulent liquid jet in a crossflow. In contrast, the turbulent breakup regime is characterized by the appearance of ligaments and drops at the upwind surface and an increased jet column diameter with increasing distance from the jet exit. The transition between these two regimes is governed by the Weber number based on the jet exit radial (cross-stream) integral length scale, specifically We_LΛ q^(1/3). When We_LΛ q^(1/3) = 17,000, it serves as the separation criterion between the aerodynamic and turbulent breakup regimes. This transition occurs within the jet Reynolds number range of Re_j = 6000–60,000, with aerodynamic breakup prevailing for Re_j < 6000 and turbulent breakup dominating for Re_j > 60,000. The physical distinction lies in the surface morphology: aerodynamic breakup exhibits wave-induced patterns similar to non-turbulent jets, while turbulent breakup shows direct ligament formation from surface irregularities due to turbulent fluctuations.",

      "1": "Sallam et al. [58], therefore, classified the breakup of a fully turbulent liquid jet in a gaseous crossflow into two major regimes known as aerodynamic breakup regime (including column, bag, multimode, and shear breakup, which is similar in appearance to the breakup of a non-turbulent liquid jet in a crossflow), and turbulent breakup regime (which is characterized by the appearance of ligaments and drops at the upwind surface and an increased jet column diameter with increasing distance from the jet exit).",
      "2": "These two regimes were separated by Weber number based on jet exit radial (cross-stream) integral length scale as follows: We_LΛ q^(1/3) = 17,000."
