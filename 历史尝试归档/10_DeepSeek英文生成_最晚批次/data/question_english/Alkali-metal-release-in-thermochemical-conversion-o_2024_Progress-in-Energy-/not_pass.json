    "question_text": "Using the Beer-Lambert law as the foundation for Tunable Diode Laser Absorption Spectroscopy (TDLAS), derive the quantitative relationship for potassium atom concentration measurement in combustion environments. Based on the provided paper content, explain how pressure affects TDLAS measurements and discuss the detection limits achievable with this technique, citing specific quantitative values from the paper.",
    "standard_answer": "The quantitative relationship for potassium atom concentration using TDLAS is derived directly from the Beer-Lambert law: -ln(I/I0) = σNL, where I0 and I are the incident and transmitted light intensities, σ is the absorption cross-section, N is the number density of potassium atoms, and L is the optical path length. Rearranging this equation gives the potassium concentration as N = -ln(I/I0)/(σL). For TDLAS measurements, the wavelength of the tunable diode laser scans across potassium absorption lines, and the absorption profile is recorded to determine absorbance. According to the paper, pressure affects TDLAS measurements through spectral broadening and line shift. The paper states that 'The effect of the pressure on the spectral broadening and line shift was determined' in potassium atom measurements using TDLAS in pressurized coal combustion systems. While the paper does not provide detailed mechanisms or quantitative relationships for pressure effects, it confirms that pressure impacts the spectral characteristics that must be accounted for in quantitative analysis. The detection limit for potassium atoms using TDLAS in combustion environments can reach '10 ng m⁻³ with a time resolution of 1.7 s' as reported in the paper, making it suitable for monitoring alkali release during biomass and coal thermochemical conversion processes. This high sensitivity enables tracking of potassium atom dynamics in various combustion environments including pressurized systems where pressure effects on spectral features must be considered.",
