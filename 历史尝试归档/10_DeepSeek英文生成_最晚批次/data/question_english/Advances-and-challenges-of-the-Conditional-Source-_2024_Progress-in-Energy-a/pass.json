    "question_text": "In turbulent premixed combustion, why is the β-function PDF often inadequate for modelling the reaction progress variable, and what alternative PDF models provide better accuracy?",
    "standard_answer": "The β-function PDF is inadequate because it does not accurately represent the bimodal or multi-modal distributions typical in premixed flames, where scalars like temperature or species mass fractions exhibit sharp gradients across flame fronts. Specifically, the β-PDF tends to overpredict mean reaction rates and filtered flame speeds, as it smooths out the distinct states of reactants and products. This inaccuracy arises from its assumption of a continuous distribution, which fails to capture the delta-function-like peaks at unburned and burned states observed in DNS and experiments. Alternatives include the flamelet PDF (Eq. 23), which incorporates contributions from unburned reactants, burning intermediates, and fully burned products via Dirac delta functions and laminar flame profiles. This model better represents the actual PDF shape, especially at high variances, but may require ad hoc clipping for low variances. Other approaches, such as the Linear Eddy Model (LEM)-based PDF, offer improved accuracy by simulating sub-grid scalar mixing, though at higher computational cost. These alternatives are essential for reliable predictions in LES and RANS, as they more faithfully reproduce the physical structure of turbulent premixed flames, reducing errors in species formation and heat release rates.",

    "question_text": "How does the doubly conditional source-term estimation (DCSE) approach enhance the accuracy of turbulence-chemistry interaction models in complex combustion regimes like local extinction or mixed-mode combustion?",
    "standard_answer": "DCSE enhances accuracy by incorporating two conditioning variables, which further reduces fluctuations around conditional means compared to single conditioning. In complex regimes such as local extinction in non-premixed flames or mixed-mode combustion in engines, single conditioning may insufficiently capture the multi-dimensional nature of scalar fields. DCSE addresses this by using a joint probability density function (PDF) of two scalars, typically mixture fraction and a progress variable, to close the mean reaction rates. This allows for better resolution of phenomena where both mixing and reaction progress vary significantly, such as during extinction events where scalar dissipation rates peak or in stratified flames where fuel-air mixing is inhomogeneous. The mathematical formulation involves solving a doubly conditioned integral equation (Eq. 13), which, despite increased computational cost, provides more precise conditional averages by leveraging the reduced spatial gradients under double conditioning. This is particularly critical in LES where filtered scales may miss small-scale events like local ignition or extinction, as DCSE's improved closure helps capture these dynamics more reliably.",
    "original_text": {
      "1": "The modelling error in the first-moment singly-conditioned CMC hypothesis increases as the fluctuations around the conditional means increase.

    "question_text": "Why is the Conditional Source-term Estimation (CSE) model considered an improvement over first-moment closure for turbulent reacting flows, and what physical mechanisms underlie its ability to reduce errors in mean reaction rate predictions?",
    "standard_answer": "The CSE model significantly improves upon first-moment closure by addressing the high non-linearity of reaction rates with respect to temperature and species concentrations, which are subject to substantial fluctuations in turbulent flows. First-moment closure evaluates reaction rates using mean/filtered scalars, leading to large errors because the mean of a non-linear function does not equal the function of the mean. CSE mitigates this by employing conditional averaging, which reduces scalar fluctuations around conditional means. Specifically, it uses the identity between conditional and unconditional scalars (Eq. 6) and assumes conditional homogeneity over ensembles, allowing inversion of an integral equation to estimate conditional reaction rates. This approach leverages the fact that conditional averages exhibit lower spatial gradients, as supported by experimental data, thereby providing more accurate closure for turbulence-chemistry interactions. The reduction in error is physically due to the decoupling of chemical kinetics from turbulent mixing scales, enabling better resolution of local extinction and reignition events that are poorly captured by unconditional means.",
    "original_text": {
      "1": "Reaction rates are highly non-linear functions of temperature and species concentrations. Turbulence results in significant fluctuations in these scalars that typically cannot be resolved in a tractable, affordable simulation since the length-and time-scales associated with these fluctuations can be orders of magnitude smaller than those associated with the mean flow.",
      "2": "Conditional averaging/filtering results in significantly lower fluctuations in the mean/filtered scalar quantity. Thus, using the conditional scalars in the chemistry model to evaluate the conditional reaction rates results in a significantly lower error compared to the no-model approach."

These parameters shape the β-PDF: a < 1 indicates a peak near ξ = 0, while b > 1 skews the distribution towards lower mixture fractions, reflecting the given mean and variance. In CSE, this PDF serves as the inversion kernel in Eq. 8, influencing the estimation of conditional scalars. A skewed PDF implies that conditional averages at certain mixture fractions (e.g., near 0) are weighted more heavily, affecting reaction rate integrals. Accurate PDF modelling is crucial because errors propagate through the CSE inversion, potentially misrepresenting local extinction or ignition events. For instance, an inaccurate PDF could smooth out high-gradient regions, leading to underprediction of peak temperatures or pollutant formation like NOx, underscoring the need for precise moment transport equations in turbulent combustion simulations.",

    "question_text": "What are the numerical challenges associated with solving the CSE integral equation, and how does Tikhonov regularization address the ill-posed nature of this inverse problem?",
    "standard_answer": "The CSE integral equation is ill-posed, meaning that small errors in the input data (e.g., unconditional scalars) can lead to large, non-physical oscillations in the solution for conditional averages. This ill-posedness arises because the integral equation is a Fredholm equation of the first kind, which is inherently unstable. Numerically, discretization transforms it into a linear system Aα = b, where direct least-squares minimization (Eq. 9) often produces oscillatory solutions due to the kernel matrix's poor conditioning. Tikhonov regularization mitigates this by adding a penalty term that minimizes both the residual and the deviation from an a priori solution α0 (Eq. 10). The regularization parameter λ balances data fidelity and solution smoothness, preventing overfitting to noisy data. Physically, this ensures that conditional averages remain smooth and physically plausible, such as adhering to laminar flamelet profiles. Methods for selecting λ, like the L-curve criterion, help optimize this balance. Without regularization, solutions may exhibit unphysical peaks or negative values, undermining combustion predictions, especially in regions with sparse data or high gradients.",

      "1": "The reason for such behaviour is that the CSE integral equation is ill-posed and needs to be regularized.",
