Conditional Source-term Estimation (CSE) is a turbulence–chemistry interaction model to simulate reacting
flows. This model is similar to the Conditional Moment Closure (CMC) approach in using the conditional scalar
field to calculate the conditional reaction rates. However, unlike CMC, where transport equations are solved
for the conditional scalars, an integral equation is inverted in CSE to estimate the conditional scalars. The
model has been developed and applied to a wide range of combustion regimes, including diffusion, premixed,
stratified premixed, mixed-mode combustion in lifted flames, spray combustion and MILD combustion in
the past two decades. It has been tested against several Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) databases in a
priori analyses and also coupled with both Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) and Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes
(RANS) flow solvers to simulate benchmark burners. The CSE model has also been used in the simulation
of practical combustion devices such as internal combustion engines and industrial furnaces. In this paper,
the fundamental basis of the CSE model is first presented, and the model’s limitations and strengths are
described. The challenges of the application of CSE to different combustion regimes are discussed through a
comprehensive review of the past published works. Mathematical and numerical implementation techniques are
presented, and future challenges in developing this turbulence–chemistry interaction model are also proposed.

1. Introduction

According to the International Energy Agency 81% of the world
total energy supply in 2019 comes from burning fossil fuels [1]. The
remaining 19% are renewable energy from which almost 60% (i.e. 9%
of the total) comes from biofuels and waste. The chemical energy of
such fuels in automotive, aircraft and rocket engines, as well as power
generation engines and many industrial processes is predominantly
released in a turbulent reacting flow field. Modelling such flows plays
a key role in the design optimization of these combustion devices to
reduce harmful combustion emissions and greenhouse gases. A minor
increase in the efficiency of such devices goes a long way in mitigation
of climate change because 64% of the global anthropogenic greenhouse
gas emissions are from fossil fuel burning and other industrial pro-
cesses [2]. At the same time, predictions of pollutant emissions from
these devices can be used in design optimization to simultaneously
improve efficiency and minimize harmful emissions, with unburned
hydrocarbons, oxides of nitrogen and particulate matter all having been
identified as being of particular concern [3].

Obtaining an acceptable estimate of the mean reaction rates is a
significant challenge for modelling a turbulent reacting flows. Reac-
tion rates are highly non-linear functions of temperature and species
concentrations. Turbulence results in significant fluctuations in these
scalars that typically cannot be resolved in a tractable, affordable
simulation since the length-and time-scales associated with these fluc-
tuations can be orders of magnitude smaller than those associated
with the mean flow. Estimating the mean/filtered reaction rates by
evaluating the rate expressions using the mean/filtered scalars di-
rectly is ordinarily unacceptably inaccurate (an approach known as
‘‘first-moment closure’’)

̃̇ωk

≠ ̇ωk( ̄ρ, ̃Yk, ̃T )

(1)

where ̇ωk is the net production rate of species k and ̄ρ is the mean
density when a Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) turbulence
model is used or the filtered density field in the Large-Eddy Simulation
(LES) context. In the above equation, ̃T and ̃Yk are the density-weighted
mean/filtered temperature and species mass fractions, respectively;
a density-weighted mean/filtered value of a scalar φ, which is also
known as the Favre averaging/filtering, is defined as ̃φ = ρφ∕ ̄ρ.

Transport equations for these Favre averaged/filtered scalars are often
used in simulations of reacting flows so as to avoid the additional
need to obtain closure for extra terms that otherwise arise in the
Reynolds-averaged or filtered transport equations due to fluctuations
in density.

A turbulence model is required to calculate the mean/filtered scalar
fields, and a chemistry model provides the species production rates
given the scalar fields. Both turbulence and chemistry are multi-scale
phenomena, and it is usually computationally intractable to calcu-
late all the scales in modelling practical combustion devices. Thus,
reduced-order models are required for these two phenomena.

The consequences of ignoring the need for a model for Turbulence–
Chemistry Interactions (TCI) in simulations of turbulent combustion
are that one risks having an extremely inaccurate prediction—so in-
accurate as to be potentially misleading, even for design purposes.
In RANS, one is most definitely not obtaining a time-resolved flow-
field, even if using an unsteady formulation, so there will inevitably be
significant, unresolved fluctuations in the temperature and species mass
fractions; the reaction rates are most highly non-linear with respect to
temperature and evaluating the reaction rate expression using the mean
will very often significantly underpredict the mean reaction rate—
the underprediction will even be different for each different reaction,
further complicating the error and its impact on the results.

With LES, the issue is more convoluted, since one is only filtering
out ‘‘small’’ time-scales. However, chemical time-scales are often very
small—indeed, as will be mentioned shortly, there are many widely-
used TCI models that presume that the chemical time-scales are all
shorter than the Kolmogorov scale. In premixed combustion, it is com-
mon for the thickness of the flame to be thinner than the Kolmogorov
length; in extreme cases, the turbulence can be so intense as to drive
the Kolmogorov length to be smaller than the thickness of the flame,
but it is nevertheless very unlikely for the flame ever to be so thick
as to be well-resolved on an LES mesh. While one could conceive
of using an extremely fine mesh in LES to model a non-premixed
flame with an extremely broad reaction zone, such that the fine LES
mesh would be fully resolving the reaction layers; there would still
be a danger of inaccuracy in such an approach: should there be, at
any point in this flow, any kind of extinction event—which could
subsequently lead to a premixed reacting front in a reigntion—that
front would likely not be resolved on the LES mesh. What is most

pernicious about this phenomenon is that extinction events are typically
associated with peaks in the local scalar gradients, which themselves
are associated with the smallest length- and time-scales in the turbulent
mixing field [4,5]; these length- and time-scales would not be present
in the LES since they would be filtered away by the LES filter. There are
surely very few flames for which one can be certain that they remain

which the reaction zone is always sufficiently broad to be well-resolved
on even a fine LES mesh. Furthermore, it is rare that one is afforded the
luxury of knowing, in advance, that one can presume such things as the
relative thickness of the reaction zone in a turbulent flame, never mind
having certainty that extinction and subsequent reignition will never
happen in the flame one intends to simulate. As such, a TCI model is
almost always required to provide an accurate estimation of ̃̇ωk in a
simulation of a turbulent flame.

Many different TCI models have been proposed that can be classified

into the following four categories:

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience104(2024)1011723

M.M. Salehi et al.

1. Algebraic models such as the Eddy Break-Up model [6], which
is based on fast chemistry and mixing-controlled reaction rate
concept.

2. Models that are based on reactor-type calculations in the com-
bustion zone using detailed chemistry such as the Eddy Dis-
sipation Concept model [7] and the Partially-Stirred Reactor
model [8].

3. Models that are based on the laminar flamelet assumption,
i.e., the flame is assumed to be locally similar to laminar flames.
The coupling between laminar flame calculations and the tur-
bulent flame in models such as the steady [9,10] and unsteady
laminar flamelet [11] models is achieved through a statistical ap-
proach by using a presumed Probability Density Function (pPDF)
model. Alternatively, topology-based approaches, including the
flame surface density model [12], the G-equation model [13,14],
and the artificially thickened flamelet model [15] have been
used.

4. Models that use the Conditional Moment Closure (CMC) ap-
proximation [16,17], where the conditional scalars are used to
calculate the conditional reaction rates.

5. The Transported Probability Density Function (TPDF) model
[18], where a joint-PDF for the scalar field is solved, and a
perfect closure for the mean/filtered reaction rates is obtained.

The relative benefits and computational costs of these different
types of models are well-documented in the literature [3,19]. Hybrid
models have also been proposed to improve accuracy and reduce
computational cost. For example, the Multiple Mapping Conditioning
model [20] is a combination of the CMC and TPDF models, or a
flamelet-type model can be coupled with the TPDF model instead of
a pPDF for better estimation of the mean reaction rates [21].

The majority of the TCI models were initially developed and tested
in the RANS context and then extended to LES. However, a few ex-
ceptions, such as the artificially thickened flamelet model [15], were
originally proposed for LES. The Conditional Source-term Estimation
(CSE) model [22] was also initially proposed for LES. This model is
based on the CMC approach for calculating the mean/filtered species
production terms, but instead of solving transport equations for the
conditional scalars, a dynamic approach is utilized to calculate the
conditional scalars from the unconditionally filtered ones.

The CSE model was proposed by Bushe and Steiner in 1999 [22].
Their initial intention was to extend the CMC model from RANS to
the LES context. However, a new TCI model was released that was not
only formulated and used in LES but also was later extended to RANS
solvers. This approach has evolved in the past two decades to model a
wide range of turbulent reacting flows from laboratory-scale flames to
actual combustion devices.

In this review paper, the theoretical basis of the model is first
explained in Section 2. The formulations of CSE with single and double
conditioning variables are presented. Next, the mathematical chal-
lenges of solving the underlying ill-posed problem are discussed, and
the solutions are explained. Finally, the necessary sub-models such as
the pPDF models are also reviewed. Then, the application of the CSE
model to non-premixed, premixed, partially-premixed and other com-
bustion regimes are reviewed in Section 3 followed by a summary and
detailed discussion of the future challenges of the model in Section 4.

2. Theory of the conditional source-term estimation model

The CSE and CMC models share a few similar modelling steps/
assumptions and assumptions, but they also differ in certain aspects.
Table 1 summarizes the modelling steps in these two models. The
conditional moment closure hypothesis is introduced in Section 2.1.
Transport equations for the conditional and unconditional scalars and
the CSE integral equation are presented in Section 2.2. The homogene-
ity assumption for conditional scalars in an ensemble is introduced

in Section 2.2 and ensemble section approaches are then reviewed
in Section 2.5. Both CSE and CMC models require a presumed PDF
sub-model which is described in Section 2.7. Other sub-sections cover
a wide range of numerical and implementation aspects of the CSE
model. Finally, the two approaches are compared in the same numerical
settings in Section 2.10.

2.1. Conditional moment closure

The CSE model relies on the first conditional moment closure hy-
pothesis, which is distinct from the unconditional first moment closure
(Eq. (1)) in that the conditional mean/filtered reaction rate is mod-
elled by evaluating the reaction rate expressions using conditional
mean/filtered scalar fields

̃̇ωk ≈ ∫

0

̇ωk(ρ|ξ, ̃Yk|ξ, ̃T |ξ) ̃Pξ(ξ)dξ

(2)

where ξ is the sample space variable for a conditioning scalar; ̃Pξ (ξ)
is the Favre-PDF of the conditioning variable; ρ|ξ, ̃Yk|ξ and ̃T |ξ are
the conditionally averaged/filtered density, species mass fractions and
temperature, respectively. For premixed combustion, where the flame
is characterized by a propagating front behind which the combustion
products are formed, a reaction progress variable is often the choice for
the conditioning scalar. This variable is defined based on temperature,
a reactant/product species mass fraction or a linear combination of
species mass fractions so that it is zero in reactants and approaches
unity in the complete combustion products. The mixture fraction is
the most common choice for the conditioning variable in non-premixed
combustion, where the heat release is predominantly controlled by the
mixing processes. This parameter is defined as the local fraction of mass
coming from the fuel stream and thus is unity in the fuel stream and
zero in the oxidizer stream [3]. More details on the conditioning scalars
and their PDF will be given in Section 2.7.

Conditional averaging/filtering results in significantly lower fluctu-
ations in the mean/filtered scalar quantity. Thus, using the conditional
scalars in the chemistry model to evaluate the conditional reaction
rates results in a significantly lower error compared to the no-model
approach, i.e., the equality in Eq. (1).

In order to quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness of the first-
moment CMC hypothesis in the mean reaction rate evaluation, an
a priori analysis using Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) data of a
statistically planar turbulent premixed flame [23–26] was performed.
The instantaneous temperature and OH mass fraction field of a plane in
the DNS data are shown in Fig. 1(a) and (d), respectively. Throughout
the paper, it is assumed that a finite volume discretization is being
used and we use the word ‘‘cell’’ to refer to an individual, discrete
finite volume; in this instance, that volume has a characteristic di-
mension of the filter scale Δ in which scalars are averaged together.
An example of an LES cell is shown with a square in the figure. The
conditionally-filtered temperature and OH mass fraction are shown in
Figs. 1(b) and (e), respectively, while he filtered temperature and OH
mass fraction in the LES cell are shown in Fig. 1(c) and (f), respectively.
The error bars represent one standard deviation of the sub-grid data.

error bars represent one standard deviation of the sub-grid temperature fluctuations. The filtered CO2 production rate in the LES cell is also calculated using the CMC and the
no-model approach.

The conditioning variable is a reaction progress variable defined as the
normalized CO2 mass fraction. Fig. 1 clearly shows that conditional
filtering significantly reduces the magnitude of fluctuations around the
mean values. The error in evaluating the species production rates is,
therefore, reduced when Eq. (2) is used compared to first-moment
closure.

As an example, the CO2 production rate is calculated with both
the first-moment closure and the CMC approaches. Two elementary
reactions contribute to the production/consumption of carbon dioxide
(CO2) in the reduced chemical kinetics mechanism used to generate the
DNS data [27]

form, as detailed in Table 2. Using this simplified mechanism, the
directly filtered CO2 production rate in the DNS data in the LES cell
shown in Fig. 1(a) is ̃̇ωCO2
= 26.2 s−1, the filtered rate using the
first-moment closure and CMC approaches are 37.0 s−1 and 28.1 s−1,
respectively. Therefore, the relative error in using the first-moment
closure approach is 41%; but this error drops to 7% when the first-
moment CMC hypothesis is used. It is worth noting that the exact PDF
was extracted from the DNS for use in Eq. (2) to calculate the filtered
production rate from the conditional rates.

2.2. The CSE inverse problem

In the original CMC combustion model, transport equations are
solved for the conditional species scalars. For example, the conditional
≡ ̃Yk|ξ are obtained from the following
species mass fractions Qk
equation [16,17]

∂tQk + ̃ui|ξ∂iQk +

k |ξ ̃Pξ)

∂i( ̄ρ̃u′
iY ′
̄ρ ̃Pξ

= ̃χ|ξ∂2

ξ Qk + ̃̇ωk|ξ

i and Y ′

where ̃ui|ξ is the conditional velocity and ̃χ|ξ is the conditional scalar
dissipation rate. Also, u′
k are the velocity and mass fraction
fluctuations around their conditional values, respectively. This trans-
port equation has an extra independent variable (i.e., the conditioning
variable ξ) in addition to the temporal and spatial coordinates. Thus,
this transport equation must also be discretized in the ξ-space. The suit-
able number of ξ grid points is determined by performing a sensitivity
analysis. It depends on the problem under consideration and selected
conditioning variable. There is no unique value. The discretized condi-
tional space must be sufficiently fine to resolve the chemical kinetics
and large gradients of the scalars in conditional space. In turbulent
non-premixed combustion, typically between 50 and 100 grid points
are found to be sufficient for the mixture fraction space discretization
[28–31]. Further examples are given in the context of CSE and DCSE
in Section 2.5. Effectively, this is adding ξ as an independent variable
to the system of equations to be solved; in order to make solution
of this equation more tractable, it is often recognized that the spatial
gradients in the conditional averages are often small, so one can use a
much more coarse grid in space [29,30]. This is justified by noting that
the gradients in conditional averages are often dramatically lower than
those in the unconditionally averaged fields.

The CSE combustion model also takes advantage of the low spatial
gradients in conditionally averaged fields, but in a different way; it
is based on solving transport equations for unconditionally averaged
scalars and then, to obtain the conditionally averaged values by solving
an inverse problem that is formed by assuming that the conditional
averages are uniform in some predetermined region in space, within
which there are many cells in which the unconditional averages are
known.

The transport equations for the unconditional species mass fractions

can take this form

̄ρ∂t

̃Yk + ̄ρ̃ui∂i

̃Yk + ∂i( ̄ρ̃u′′
i Y ′′

k ) = ∂i( ̄ρ

k∂i

̃Yk) + ̄ρ̃̇ωk

(5)

i and Y ′′

where ̃ui is the Favre-filtered velocity field, u′′
k are the velocities
and mass fraction fluctuations around the filtered values, respectively,
k is the molecular diffusivity of the kth species. The ̃u′′
and 
i Y ′′
k term
represents the sub-grid scale turbulent scalar flux, which is unclosed
and is often modelled using a gradient transport model [3]. The CSE
inverse problem is formulated from the following identity between the
conditional and unconditional scalars

(4)

̃φ = ∫
0

̃φ|ξ ̃Pξ (ξ)dξ

(6)

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience104(2024)1011725

M.M. Salehi et al.

where φ in this equation represents any scalar required by the chem-
istry model, such as temperature and/or species mass fractions. Trans-
port equations in the form of Eq. (5) are solved for these scalars on a
computational grid with a filter scale of Δ. The essential assumption
in the CSE model is that the conditional scalars are homogeneous in
an ensemble of cells in the spatial domain, often referred to as the test
filter with ̂Δ > Δ in the LES terminology. Using this assumption, Eq. (6)
is re-written for all of the points in the ensemble in the following form:

1

xi ∈ E ̂Δ

̂φ|ξ ̃Pξ (ξ, xi)dξ

̃φ(xi) = ∫
0
where xi is the spatial coordinates of the LES points in the ensemble E ̂Δ,
and ̂φ|ξ is the conditionally-filtered value of φ at the ensemble (i.e., test
filter) level. Eq. (7) is a Fredholm integral equation of the first kind with
̂φ|ξ being the unknown and ̃Pξ (ξ, xi) the inversion kernel.

(7)

As mentioned above, the CSE homogeneity assumption is similar
to that commonly made in the CMC combustion model when it is
applied to LES, where a separate CMC grid – much larger than the
LES grid ΔCMC ≫ Δ used to solve for the velocity field – is used to
reduce the computational cost [29,30]. Experimental results of the non-
premixed Sandia flame series away from local extinction events [32]
and partially-stratified Cambridge-Sandia [33] flames show that the
spatial variation of conditional scalars is significantly lower compared
to the unconditional ones.

The approach taken in the CSE model is similar to other dynamic
sub-grid scale LES models. For example, in the dynamic Smagorinsky
model, the effect of sub-grid scales on the resolved velocity field is
modelled utilizing the Germano identity (analogous to the Eq. (6)
identity used in the CSE model) [34]. The Germano identity is a
tensor identity that reads: ̂̄ui ̄uj − ̂̄ui ̂̄uj = Tij − ̂τij , where the left-
hand side is known, and the right-hand side terms are modelled as
̄Sij .
Tij − (Tkk∕3)δij = −2Cs
≡ 1∕2(∂j ui + ∂iuj ) is the strain-rate tensor. Similar to the CSE
The Sij
homogeneity assumption, the model parameter Cs is assumed to be
constant at the test filter level. Then, a least-squares error approach can
be used to calculate this parameter from the nine equations provided
by the Germano tensor identity [35].

The number ratio of the test filter size to the LES filter is often
between 2 to 3. This ratio in CMC/CSE is often much larger to reduce
the computational cost. If a localized phenomenon such as local ignition
is to be captured, this ratio is reduced. For example, Navarro-Martinez
et al. [29] used a 4 × 4 × 64 CMC grid in a 96 × 96 × 320 LES
grid in LES-CMC of the Sandia flame D jet diffusion flame. The CMC
grid is fine in the axial direction (i.e. 64) but is coarse in the radial
and tangential axi-symmetric direction. The Reynolds number in this
flame is relatively low and local extinction does not occur. Garmory and
Mastorakos [36], on the other hand, performed LES-CMC of the higher
Reynolds number flame of the Sandia series (i.e. Flame F) with frequent
local extinctions. They used a much finer CMC grid of 23 × 23 × 23 to
resolve the spatial variation of the conditional averages due to local
extinction.

2.3. Numerical solution of the integral equation

In order to solve the Eq. (7) numerically, the conditioning space is
discretized into M bins. For each bin [ξ
], an average value of
the conditional average ̂φ|ξj is calculated. Thus, Eq. (13) is transformed
into the following linear system of equations

progress variable in LES of a turbulent premixed flame in a Bunsen
burner [37]. The reason for such behaviour is that the CSE integral
equation is ill-posed and needs to be regularized.

Tikhonov regularization [38] is the most common approach in past
CSE works, where not only the residual of the linear system of equations
A⃗α = ⃗b is minimized, but also the norm of the difference between the
solution and an a priori knowledge of the solution ⃗α0 is also minimized

where I is the unity matrix, and λ is the regularization parameter.
The ⃗α0 is obtained from the solution of the previous time, canonical
laminar flame calculations or simply set to null vector. Fig. 2 shows
the solution of Eq. (10) for the conditional H2O mass fraction when a
one-dimensional freely-propagating laminar flame solution is used for
⃗α0. Further mathematical details on the nature of ill-posedness, other
regularization approaches and how the regularization parameter λ is
selected are presented in Section 2.9.

Initiating a CFD solver with the CSE model can be accomplished
through various methods. In stationary flames, where the time-averaged
solution is steady, an initial flamelet solution can be used for the
conditional scalars ̃φ|ξ and the forward integral of Eq. (6) is solved for
a few time steps to obtain a meaningful initial flamelet solution [37].
Alternatively, the unconditional scalars can be initialized from the first
time step, followed by solving the CSE inverse problem. For example,
product species can be initialized to their equilibrium values [39]. In
this approach, if the previous time step is used for ⃗α0, then the zero
value can be used for this vector in the first time step [40]. It is also
possible to set the conditional product species to burning values in the
initial time steps to maintain a reacting solution prior to solving the
CSE inverse problem [41].

The modelling error in the first-moment singly-conditioned CMC
hypothesis (i.e., Eq. (2) with a single conditioning variable) increases
as the fluctuations around the conditional means increase. Exam-
ples of such conditions are non-premixed flames with local extinc-
tion [42], combustion in homogeneous charge compression ignition
engines where both auto-ignition and propagating fronts exists [43,
44], partially-stratified combustion where both mixture fraction and
progress variable have significant spatial variations [45], spray flames
with mixed-mode combustion [46], and super-critical non-premixed

ditions, the doubly-conditioned CMC hypothesis can be used to close
the filtered/mean chemical reaction source terms

where ̃Pzc (ζ, ξ) is the joint-PDF of the two conditioning variables, and
̃φ|ξ, ζ is the filtered/mean value of the scalar φ doubly conditioned on
ξ and ζ. The details on how the joint-PDF is modelled are discussed
in Section 2.7. Recently, Sekularac et al. [48] performed Principal
Component Analysis (PCA) on Sandia flames experimental data to au-
tomatically select two conditioning variables for DCSE. They identified
a strong correlation between these variables and a temperature-based
progress variable, as well as the mixture fraction. Furthermore, they
observed that doubly-conditional averaging decouples the conditional
means from the spatial domain.

The first application of Doubly Conditional Source-term Estimation
(DCSE) is the work of Dovizio et al. [40] where they extended the
identity of Eq. (6) to two conditions

Similar to the singly-conditioned CSE, the above equation is used in an

dient of the conditional averages is substantially reduced with double
conditioning compared to single conditioning. The above integral equa-
tion is discretized in a Nξ × Nζ grid in the sample space. For each cell

ijk is a 3D inversion kernel matrix. This equation can be simply
cast into the A⃗α = ⃗b form, with A being a 2D M × N matrix with
M = Nξ ×Nζ . Therefore, the inverse problem can be solved numerically
using the same numerical approach described for single-conditioned
CSE (i.e., Eq. (10)).

2.5. Ensemble selection

The CSE integral equation is solved in an ensemble E ̂Δ with N
LES cells. Most of the previous CSE simulations were performed on
laboratory-scale benchmark burners with axisymmetric flames. The
unconditional and conditional statistics are thus homogeneous in the
tangential direction. Furthermore, the ensembles must span partly in
the radial and axial directions to have enough statistics for the CSE
inversion process. The ensembles are thus taken to be full discs or disc
sectors. These ensembles can be set manually in jet-type flames with
simple cylindrical [37,39,51,52] or conical frustum [53,54] geometries.
For complex geometries, on the other hand, domain decomposition is
not trivial and one may need to resort to more complex algorithms. Ni-
varti et al. [55] proposed a modified Morton ordering [56] approach
that not only automatically partitions the mesh but also enforces spatial
locality of the partitions. Fig. 3 shows an example of the CSE ensembles
generated by using this approach in a section of a bluff-body burner.

The minimum number of LES cells per ensemble depends on the
number of unknowns M, i.e., the number of bins in the conditioning

a modified Morton-ordering approach.

space. In singly conditioned CSE, M = 40 was used in LES of turbulent
non-premixed Sandia flames [53,54]; a value of M = 50 was used
in LES of a turbulent premixed Bunsen flame [37,51] and a spray
flame [52]. The number of unknowns increases in LES-DCSE to a value
between M = 500 to 1000. Labahn and Devaud [57] used 500 bins
in DCSE modelling of a turbulent diffusion flame under Moderate or
Intense Low-oxygen Dilution (MILD) conditions [58] with 50 bins in the
mixture fraction sample space and 10 bins in the oxidizer split (i.e. a
second mixture fraction defined to distinguish between the reacting
mixtures and the co-flowing air). Mortada and Devaud [39] used 50
bins in the mixture fraction space and 20 in the progress variable
space to model a lifted flame. The number of bins in the mixture
fraction space was reduced to 35 by Dovizio and Devaud [59] to model
a partially-stratified flame with relatively limited values of mixture
fraction resulting in M = 700.

The number of LES cells per ensemble, in practice, should be much
larger than the number of unknowns. For example, Labahn and Devaud
[57] decomposed a mesh of 1.5 million cells into 64 CSE ensembles,
resulting in N being approximately 24,000 in their LES-DCSE mod-
elling, aimed at solving for M = 500 unknowns. Similarly, Shahbazian
et al. [37] decomposed a mesh consisting of 1,638,400 cells into 800
ensembles, each comprising N = 2048 cells, for LES-CSE modelling
of a premixed flame with M = 50. Similar numbers are used in
CMC super-grids; for example, Farrace et al. [30] used 3000 cells
per CMC cell in a large-eddy simulation of a bluff-body stabilized
premixed flame. Although this decision in the CMC model is not
necessary and is solely taken to reduce the computational cost, using
such large ensembles is essential to obtain a meaningful solution in the
CSE model. The main reason is that many LES cells in an ensemble
contain non-reacting mixtures and thus do not have useful information
to reconstruct the conditional averages. Furthermore, regression-type
models require (10) training data per parameter for a good fit [60].
Thus, the number of reacting cells in an ensemble in single-conditioned
CSE is recommended to be of (103), and in DCSE, is recommended to
be (104). The following condition can be used to distinguish reacting
cells from the non-reacting ones [51]

̃c(1 − ̃c) > ε

(15)

where ̃c is the filtered reaction progress variable, and ε is a threshold
that is usually kept between 10−2 to 10−3 [51]. Another important
factor in the CSE ensemble selection is the computational cost. The
computational complexity of the numerical solution of the CSE inverse

problem is of (M 2N) [61]. Since the computational cost is linear
with respect to the number of points in the ensemble, the number
of ensembles does not have any effect on the computational cost
in a single-processor simulation. For example, it does not matter if
the computational domain is split into 20 ensembles, each having N
reacting cells or 40 ensembles with N∕2 reacting cells. This is certainly
not the case in parallel simulations where the computational cost of the
CSE inversion is split between the processors. Mortada and Devaud [39]
performed a numerical experiment on LES-DCSE simulations of a lifted
flame using different ensembles as shown in Fig. 4. They use one CSE
ensemble per processor. Their results show that the computational cost
decreases as the number of ensembles increases. This trend is partly
due to the CSE inversion cost reduction as the number of reacting cells
per ensemble decreases with increasing the number of processors. They
finally selected the 24 ensembles case shown in Fig. 4(c) because the
number of reacting cells in the 48 ensemble case (Fig. 4a) occasionally
decreases below the minimum value in a few ensembles near the flame
base resulting in non-physical solutions for the conditional scalars.

For large-scale parallel cases, the reacting cells on different proces-
sors can be combined to form an ensemble, as proposed by Tsui and
Bushe [51]. The algorithm is shown schematically in Fig. 5. In this
approach, each processor sends its number of reacting cells to a master
processor. The master processor dynamically determines the ensembles
and assigns each ensemble to a set of processors. A local master proces-
sor constructs the CSE least-squares error problem (i.e. Eq. (10)). This
problem is then solved [62] in parallel with the local master and slave
processors using a parallel version of the Least-Square QR-factorization
(LSQR) of Paige and Saunders [63]. This dynamic ensemble selection
algorithm improves the parallel load-balancing properties of the CSE
solver, i.e., the CSE inversion computations are evenly distributed
between all the processors.

The above works reviewed and discussed are restricted to the reg-
ular CSE and DCSE approaches explained in Sections 2.2 and 2.4.
Recently, Mahdipour and Salehi [61] proposed a new regularization
approach where the conditional scalars are approximated with a series
expansion of the Bernstein basis functions. This approach, which will
be discussed in detail in Section 2.9, substantially reduces the number
of unknowns in the CSE integral equation. Therefore, the number of
LES cells per ensemble can be reduced to as low as 16, resulting in a
so-called localized CSE approach.

2.6. From LES to RANS

Although the CSE combustion model was initially proposed for LES,
it can be easily extended to the RANS context. Transport equations for
the temporal or ensemble-averaged velocity field and scalars (similar
to Eq. (5)) are solved. The averaged scalar field is then used in the
CSE integral equation to calculate the conditionally-averaged value of
the scalars in an ensemble of points. The first applications of the CSE
model in the RANS context were on the simulation of auto-igniting
non-premixed jets [64,65]. Because of the successful applications of
the CSE model in the RANS context, as well as the substantially-lower

computational cost of the RANS calculations compared to LES, the
extension of the CSE model to premixed [66], partially-premixed [40]
and other regimes (e.g., Ref. [67] for MILD combustion) were first
performed in the RANS context. More details will be presented in the
second part of the paper in Section 3.

Overlapping ensembles may be beneficial, especially in RANS simu-
lations in two-dimensional domains [40,41,68]. Under such settings,
the number of reacting cells may not be sufficient for accurate CSE
integral inversions. Overlapping ensembles increases the number of
cells per ensemble and allows data sharing for the inversion process,
resulting in smooth spatial variations of the conditional averages. In
LES, the ensembles are typically defined without overlap due to much
larger numbers of reacting cells in the ensembles and easier domain
decomposition for parallel processing [39,52,69]. The number of active
cells in each ensemble is much higher compared to typical RANS setups.

2.7. Probability density function model

The CSE inversion kernel in Eq. (8) (Eq. (14) in DCSE) is constructed
from the PDF of the conditioning variable (the joint-PDF in DCSE).
Similar to the flamelet and CMC models, a presumed PDF model is used
in CSE, where a functional form is presumed for the PDF and formed
as a function of the first two statistical moments of the conditioning
variable.

2.7.1. Turbulent non-premixed combustion

In non-premixed flames, the conditioning variable is often taken to
be the mixture fraction. This quantity is defined as the mass fraction
of the material originating from the fuel stream [70]. Assuming unity
Lewis number for all species, the mixture fraction becomes a passive
scalar with the following instantaneous transport equation

ρ∂tz + ρui∂iz = ∂i(ρ∂iz)

(16)

where z is the mixture fraction. The β-function distribution – that was
originally proposed by Richardson et al. [71] – provides a good approx-
imation of the mixture fraction PDF in turbulent mixing layers [9,72].
This function has the following form

̃Pβ (ζ; a, b) =

ζ a−1(1 − ζ)b−1
∫ 1
0 ζ a−1(1 − ζ)b−1dζ

(17)

where the denominator can be represented as a function of Gamma
functions Γ (a)Γ (b)∕Γ (a + b) [20], and a and b are the PDF parameters
≡ ̃(z − ̃z)2 of the

as 
t = νt∕Sct, where νt is the turbulent viscosity that is obtained from
the turbulence model, and Sct is the turbulent Schmidt number. This
number is set to a constant value of 0.7 in RANS simulations [3]. In LES,
this parameter can either be calculated dynamically [73], or constant
values of 0.4 [74–76] and 0.7 [77–79] have been used in the literature.
Recently, Zhao and Zhang [80] performed a sensitivity analysis on
the turbulent Schmidt number and found that changing this parameter
between 0.4 and 0.7 does not have a significant effect on the velocity
field and the species mass fractions. The mixture fraction variance is
also required by Eqs. (18) and (19) to construct the PDF. Algebraic
models are proposed for this parameter in the LES context [81–83],
but solving a transport equation is often preferred in both RANS and
LES [84]

̃χz = cd ̃zv∕τ, where cd is a constant of the order of unity and τ is a
mixing time scale. This time scale is modelled as τ = Δ∕u′
Δ in LES,
with Δ and u′
Δ being the filter scale and the sub-filter scale velocity
fluctuations, respectively. Several different models are available for
u′
Δ [85]. For example, Lilly [86] proposed u′
Δ = νt∕(Cν Δ) where Cν is a
model constant. In the RANS context, the mixing time scale is estimated
from τ = ̃k∕̃ε, where ̃k is the mean turbulent kinetic energy and ̃ε is
mean dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy.

2.7.2. Turbulent premixed combustion

The conditioning variable most commonly used in premixed flames
is a reaction progress variable, which is c = 0 in reactants and
approaches c = 1 in products. This variable is often defined based on a
normalized product species mass fraction

species [92]. A reactant species mass fraction [93] or normalized tem-
perature [72,94] were also used to define a progress variable. Rigorous
optimization algorithms are available to automatically define a reac-
tion progress variable to be strictly monotonic and resolve important
kinetic processes in different layers of the flame [95]. Principal Com-
ponent Analysis (PCA) of turbulent flame data can also help identify
the reaction progress variable that minimizes fluctuations around the
conditional averages [48,96].

Similar to non-premixed flames, the β-distribution was also used
for the PDF of the reaction progress variable initially by Peters et al.
[72] and Bradley et al. [94] in flamelet modelling of turbulent pre-
mixed flames. This PDF model was also used in CMC modelling of
turbulent premixed flames both in the RANS [97,98] and LES [30,99]
contexts. Bray et al. [100] was the first to show that the β-PDF over-
predicts the mean production rates in the RANS simulation of turbulent
premixed flames. Fiorina et al. [101] and Salehi et al. [102] showed
that using the β-PDF may result in over-prediction of the filtered flame
speed in LES unless the filter scale is of the order of the laminar flame
thickness as shown in Fig. 6.

The actual PDF shapes obtained from DNS [87] and experiment
[102] are substantially different from the β-function. An example is
shown in Fig. 7. Several alternatives were proposed in the litera-
ture [87,100,103–107]. Bray et al. [100] proposed the flamelet PDF
as

̃Pf (ξ; c0, c∇, c1) = c0δ(ξ) + c∇

ρ(ξ)
̄ρ|dξ∕dx|

+ c1δ(1 − ξ)

(23)

where ξ is the sample space variable for c, δ(ξ) is the Dirac delta
function, and ρ(ξ) and dξ∕dx are obtained from the solution of a
one-dimensional
laminar premixed flame using detailed chemistry.
The three model parameters, i.e., c0, c∇ and c1 are calculated from

can be cut at both or either end [66,87,102,106,107], or the flamelet
PDF model can be combined with the β-PDF for low variance val-
ues [103,104,108]. Fig. 7 shows an actual PDF shape obtained from
DNS data [109], the β-PDF, and the modified flamelet PDF of Jin
et al. [87] for the DNS mean and variance values. As can be seen, the
flamelet-PDF is a superior candidate compared to the β-PDF, but the ad
hoc clipping results in noticeable deviations from the actual PDF. Tsui
and Bushe [105] proposed to use the Linear Eddy Model (LEM) of Ker-
stein [110] to model the PDF. The results in Fig. 7 demonstrate that the
LEM-PDF compares more favourably with the DNS-PDF than the other
two options; it is worth noting, however, that the LEM-PDF requires
considerably more implementation, data processing and computational
pre-processing time, which may not be justified.

The mean/filtered progress variable and its variance are obtained
from the following transport equations, which are similar to Eqs. (20)
and (21) with chemical source terms [3,103]:

̄ρ∂t ̃c + ̄ρ ̃ui∂i ̃c = ∂i( ̄ρ

filter scale variance [74]. Eqs. (26) and (27) are usually obtained with a

i c′′ = −

gradient-type transport assumption for the mean/sub-filter scalar flux,
i.e., ̃u′′
t∂i ̃c. However, a reactive scalar may have a counter-
gradient scalar flux, especially under low-turbulence conditions [111].
Algebraic models are available for this phenomenon for RANS [112]
and LES [113] turbulence models. The scalar dissipation rate ̃χc in
Eq. (27) is more complicated compared to the mixture fraction dissi-
pation rate in Eq. (21). In addition to turbulent dissipation, one needs
to account for the dilatation, curvature, chemical reaction and the
interaction between turbulence and the scalar gradient effects to be
̃χc. These physical effects are included in the
able to correctly model
transport equations for this parameter in the RANS context
[114–
116]. Kolla et al. [117] assumed that the production and dissipation
terms of such transport equations are assumed to be in equilibrium
to propose an algebraic model. Another algebraic model in the RANS
context is proposed by Vervisch et al. [118] based on the flame surface
density modelling approach. The progress variable dissipation rate
of Kolla et al. [117] was extended to LES by Dunstan et al. [119],
and further developed by Langella et al. [120] to dynamically calculate
the model constants. Tsui and Bushe [105] also proposed a scalar
dissipation rate model obtained from the Linear Eddy Model (LEM-SDR)
that compares well with both DNS [105] and experiments [121].

2.7.3. Turbulent partially-premixed combustion

The most convenient and thus widely-used approach in modelling
the joint-PDF of the reaction progress variable and the mixture fraction
in partially-premixed flames ̃Pzc (ζ, ξ) is to assume statistical indepen-
dence between the two variables and multiply the marginal PDFs as

̃Pzc (ζ, ξ) ≈ ̃Pz(ζ) ̃Pc (ξ)

(28)

Many simulations have successfully used the β-distribution for both
marginal PDFs in the CSE [122] and CMC [46] modelling of spray
flames. The same choices were made in flamelet modelling of lifted
flames [123], partially-stratified swirl combustors [78,124], and flames
with mixed-mode combustion regimes [125–128]. The marginal PDF
of the reaction progress variable ̃Pc has also been taken to be a single
Dirac delta function δ(ξ − ̃c) in LES-flamelet modelling of mixed-mode
flames [129–131]. Another choice for ̃Pc is the flamelet PDF used in
CSE simulations of lifted flames [40] and partially stratified flames [59,
89]. A combination of four Dirac delta functions has also been used in
both mixture fraction and progress variable sample space to model the
joint-PDF for RANS simulations of partially stratified flames [132,133].
Direct numerical simulation data [134,135], experimental data
[136,137] and transported-PDF modelling [138] – where the joint-
PDF is solved – show that the joint-PDF obtained from Eq. (28) with
the statistical independency assumption may deviate from the actual
PDF. The deviation may be significant as shown in Fig. 8 when the
covariance between the mixture fraction and the reaction progress
variable ̃c′′z′′ is significant. Furthermore, when the mixture fraction
variance ̃zv is low, the joint-PDF obtained from Eq. (28) may be a good
representation of the actual PDF [135].

A few presumed-PDF models for the joint-PDF have been proposed
to relax the statistical independency assumptions [134,139–141]. Kro-
nenburg and Kostka [139] proposed to use Bayes’ decomposition to
model the joint-PDF
̃Pzc (ζ, ξ) = ̃Pz(ζ) ̃Pc|z(ξ, ζ)
where a β-PDF is used for ̃Pz(ζ) and the conditional PDF is formed
from a presumed PDF model (e.g., β-PDF or the flamelet PDF) using
the conditional mean ̃c|ζ and variance ̃cv|ζ as the PDF parameters,
i.e., ̃Pc|z(ξ, ζ; ̃c|ζ, ̃cv|ζ). A similar approach was taken by Grout et al.
[134]. CMC-like transport equations similar to Eq. (4) should be solved
to calculate ̃c|ζ and ̃cv|ζ. Such transport equations involve several
unclosed terms that need to be modelled, especially for the second
moment. Furthermore, since the joint-PDF is required in each compu-
tational cell, the transport equations cannot be solved in a grid larger

than the computational grid. Therefore, this model is computationally
expensive.

Another approach is to use the covariance ̃c′′z′′ to form a correlated
joint-PDF. Robin et al. [140,142] simply used four Dirac functions in
the ζ − ξ sample space to form a presumed correlated joint-PDF model:

̃Pzc(ζ, ξ) ≈ α1δ(ξ − c1)δ(ζ − z1) + α2δ(ξ − c3)δ(ζ − z1)
+α3δ(ξ − c3)δ(ζ − z2) + α4δ(ξ − c4)δ(ζ − z2)

(30)

same approach was also used by Chen et al. [148] to model the joint-
PDF using DNS data of turbulent reacting flows under MILD conditions.
Machine learning tools were also used to model the marginal PDFs of
the reaction progress variable [149] and mixture fraction [150]. Yang
et al. [149] showed that although the modelled PDF was trained using
DNS data of turbulent reacting flows under MILD conditions, it can also
predict the reaction progress variable PDF in premixed swirling flames,
V flames and stagnation flames as well.

where the model parameters (i.e., α1, ... , α4, c1, ... , c4, z1 and z2) are
determined from ̃c, ̃cv, ̃z, ̃zv, ̃c′′z′′ and the fact that the definite integral
of the joint, marginal and conditional PDFs over the entire sample space
are equal to one. Darbyshire and Swaminathan [141] proposed to use
the copula approach to construct the joint-PDF from the marginal PDFs
and the covariance [143]

where  is a copula function with ̃c′′z′′ as an input parameter. This
model was successfully used by Ruan et al. [144] and Chen et al.
[145] to simulate lifted flames, and by Mousemi and Bushe [136]
to model the ̃Pzc(ζ, ξ) in a stratified swirl-stabilized flame. Obtain-
ing the covariance ̃c′′z′′ from an extra transport equation [146] is
recommended.

Machine learning techniques were proposed by de Frahan et al.
[147] to model the joint-PDF of the mixture fraction and the reaction
progress variable. They trained several models using DNS data of a low-
swirl burner and found that the accuracy and computational cost of the
deep neural network are better compared to the other approaches. The

2.8. Inclusion of chemical kinetics

The CSE combustion model was introduced in different combustion
regimes using single-step [22,47,135] and two-step [53,87] chemical
kinetic mechanisms, mainly because the DNS data used for the a priori
analysis was generated using such simplified mechanisms. Neverthe-
less, the CSE model was further used in numerous CFD simulations
with tabulated chemistry models such as Trajectory-Generated Lower-
Dimensional Manifold (TGLDM) model and flamelet chemistry models
in different combustion regimes. Realistic detailed chemistry models
with elementary steps are only coupled with CSE in an a priori analysis
using DNS data [61] as will be discussed below.

2.8.1. TGLDM

The TGLDM model [151] is a tabulated chemistry model similar
to the Intrinsic Lower-Dimensional Manifold (ILDM) approach of Maas
and Pope [152]. In the ILDM approach, the detailed chemical kinetics
is reduced using a dynamical systems approach. The conservation

equation of species mass fractions of constant pressure and constant
enthalpy reacting dynamical system is as follows

∂tYk = ̇ωk

(32)

The trajectories in the hyper-dimensional composition space of such
dynamical systems approach one another and lie on a ns-dimensional
manifold as they advance towards the equilibrium. Fig. 9 shows differ-
ent trajectories in a three-dimensional composition sub-space and their
convergence before reaching the equilibrium state. The eigenvalues of
the reacting Jacobian matrix J = ∂ ̇ωk∕∂Yj determines the chemical time
scales of the reacting dynamical system. Using species with slow time
scales, a ns-dimensional manifold can be formed as a reduced chemical
kinetics model [152]. This can be done by either Schur decomposition
of the Jacobian matrix [152] or the Fraser algorithm [153,154].

In the TGLDM approach, the dynamical system of Eq. (32) is solved
directly using detailed kinetics from the realizable boundary of the
composition space, resulting in many trajectories in this space. The
trajectory starting points on the realizable boundary are obtained from
element balance using ne + ns major species, where ne is the number
of elements in the reacting mixture, and ns is the dimension of the
lower-dimensional manifold (i.e., the number of progress variables)
ne+ns∑

Y(e, k)Yk = Ye

(33)

k=1
here Ye is the mass fraction of element e, and Y(e, k) is the mass fraction
of element e in species k. This linear system of equations determines the
realizable boundary of the composition space. For example, for CH4-O2
combustion, ne = 3 and YC , YH and YO are calculated from the initial
mixture, knowing the mixture equivalence ratio. For a two-dimensional
and YH2O as the two progress variables, values of
manifold with YCO2
≥ 0, and the mass fraction of
YCO2
CH4, O2 and a third species (often CO) is calculated from Eq. (33). The
other species are either set to zero or obtained from the constrained
equilibrium assumption [155], and the temperature is calculated from
an energy balance. Fig. 10 shows the trajectory starting points and the
generated trajectories for acetone spray flames [156].

and YH2O are changed subject to Yk

The thermo-chemical state realizations data along the trajectories
are tabulated as a function of ns progress variables. A Delaunay tri-
angulation algorithm [157] can then be used for interpolation in the
lookup table as shown in Fig. 11.

This approach was successfully used in the simulation of non-
premixed flames involving methane–air combustion [41,54,65,158,
159]. Attempts to generate TGLDMs for longer-chain hydrocarbons

have been unsuccessful because, as the chemistry becomes more com-
plex, the trajectories cross one another more frequently—indeed, for n-
heptane, trajectories can even be found to cross themselves, which has
proven to be a particularly vexing challenge to overcome. Furthermore,
premixed flames cannot be accurately modelled with this approach
unless a large number of progress variables are used [160,161]. The
reason is that, unlike non-premixed combustion where chemical re-
actions happen under high-temperature conditions, low-temperature
combustion occurs in the premixed flame front. The dominant mech-
anism for flame front propagation in the low-temperature zones of
premixed flames is molecular diffusion. Fig. 12 compares the diffusion
and production terms in species balance equations along the centre-line
of a counter-flow premixed flame in a reactant-to-product configuration
and a diffusion flame. As shown in Fig. 12, the thin premixed flame
enhances the species concentration gradients and thus the diffusion
flux to the upstream low-temperature zones of the flame results in
fuel pyrolysis and initiates chemical reactions. In contrast, the chemical
reactions in a diffusion flame typically occur under high-temperature
conditions and the diffusion rates remain in balance with chemical
production rates.

It was, therefore, suggested by van Oijen and de Goey [160]
and Gicquel et al. [161] to solve the balance equations of a one-
dimensional freely propagating premixed flame instead of Eq. (32) to

This approach was named Flame-Prolongation of ILDM (FPI) by Gicquel
et al. [161] and Flame-Generated Manifold (FGM) by van Oijen and
de Goey [160]. Bykov and Maas [162] also proposed to include the
diffusion effects in the lower-dimensional manifold by extending the
original ILDM approach to a Reaction-Diffusion Manifold (REDIM).

Salehi et al. [88] used Eq. (34) along with a similar equation for
energy balance to generate the trajectories shown in Fig. 10. They
used this tabulated reduced chemistry model with the CSE approach
to simulate a turbulent premixed Bunsen flame. The same approach
was used by Dovizio et al. [163] to simulate a bluff-body stabilized
premixed flame using a RANS-type turbulence model. Shahbazian et al.
[37] also used the same chemistry model in a large-eddy simulation of
a turbulent premixed Bunsen flame.

2.8.2. CSE with flamelet solutions

Unlike CSE and CMC, where transport equations are solved for
the conditional moments ̃φ|ξ, flamelet models use the solution of the
canonical flames to presume the conditional moments. The most com-
mon configuration is the counter-flow flames at different strain rates,
where the governing equations can either be solved in the physical
coordinates [128,164] or the conditioning variable coordinate [9,165].
Using such flamelet libraries, the conditional moments can be approx-
imated as a series expansion of flamelets at different hydrodynamic
strain rates

̃φ|ξ ≈

Nf
∑

n=1

anφn(ξ)

(35)

where Nf is the number of flamelets, φn(ξ) are flamelet values of the
scalar φ, and an is the discrete PDF of the hydrodynamic strain rate
upstream of the flame, which is unknown. Using Eq. (35) in Eq. (6)
gives

̃Pξ(ξ)dξ

(36)

Since the an is independent of ξ, and also if the presumed-PDF model
used in Eq. (36) does not depend on the strain rate (which is often the
case), the summation and the integral can be interchanged as

̃φ =

Using the CSE approach described in Section 2.2, a transport equation
is solved for ̃φ, and it is assumed that an is the same for every point xi

in an ensemble of LES cells to arrive at the following linear system of
equations

∑

̃φ(xi) =

where Φn(xi) ≡ ∫ 1
0 φn(ξ) ̃Pξ(ξ, xi)dξ can be calculated before the LES
simulation and tabulated as a function of the mean and the variance of
the conditioning variable. This linear system of equations can be solved
using a non-negative least-square (NNLS) error approach [166] because
the unknowns an are positive.

This approach was introduced by Bushe and Steiner [167] and
termed Laminar Flamelet Decomposition (LFD). They performed an a
priori analysis using DNS data of a non-premixed turbulent flame. Wang
and Bushe [168] and Ferraris and Wen [169] used this approach in
LES of Sandia flame D. This approach was also used by Grout et al.
[64] in RANS simulation of a turbulent igniting jet flame and by Fang
et al. [170] in LES of a spray flame. Mahdipour and Salehi [171]
extended this approach to premixed combustion simulation in a priori
tests using DNS data. The accuracy of this model relies on how close
the flamelet solutions represent the actual conditional moments. This
is case-dependent and indeed depends on the combustion regime and
turbulent conditions, as will be discussed case by case in Section 3.

2.8.3. CSE with detailed chemistry

The CSE model was never used in LES/RANS simulations with
realistic chemistry consisting of elementary reaction steps including
detailed – or even simplified skeletal – mechanisms. The only CSE test
with such chemical kinetics models was the work of Mahdipour and
Salehi [61]. They assessed the performance of the CSE model using
a DNS database generated with the skeletal mechanism of Smooke
and Giovangigli [27] for methane–air combustion with 16 species and
35 reactions. They showed that CSE with an optimized regularization
approach – as detailed in Section 2.9 – is comparable to the coarse-grid
CMC approach. Nevertheless, in the CMC approach, conservation equa-
tions are solved for the conditional species mass fractions. Although
there exist modelling errors in the convection, diffusion and rates of
reactions, these processes intrinsically conserve the elemental mass
fractions. In the CSE method, on the other hand, the conditional species
mass fractions are obtained from solving an inverse problem, and there
is no intrinsic guarantee that the atomic mass fractions are conserved.
The a priori tests in Ref. [61] were performed using one single snapshot
of the DNS data. The errors in the mass conservation of the elements
will likely accumulate over time in a RANS/LES simulation, leading to
the failure of the CSE method.

The RANS/LES calculations performed with the CSE model so far
were utilizing TGLDM/flamelet tabulated chemistry models where the

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience104(2024)10117213

M.M. Salehi et al.

atomic mass fractions are intrinsically conserved. This is certainly not
the case with detailed realistic chemistry models. One way to avoid
this problem might be to invert for all species simultaneously while
explicitly adding a constraint that requires elemental conservation. This
is a matter for future research.

2.9. Regularization of the CSE inverse problem

As discussed in Section 2.3, the numerical solution of the discrete
form of the CSE integral equation, i.e., A⃗α = ⃗b, cannot be obtained by
a simple least-squares error approach because the problem is ill-posed.
In this section, the nature of ill-posedness is first discussed, and the
solutions with detailed numerical implementation techniques are then
presented.

2.9.1. Ill-posed problem

According to Hadamard [172], the solution of a well-posed problem
should (I) exist, (II) be unique, and (III) not be sensitive to small
perturbations in the input data. The Fredholm integral equation of the
first kind is ill-posed because it fails to satisfy conditions (II) and/or
(III). The type and nature of ill-posedness can be diagnosed using
Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of the inversion kernel matrix

A = UΣVT

(39)

where A is an N × M matrix, Σ is a diagonal matrix with M singular
values σi, and U and V are orthogonal matrices. Knowing the singular
values and the U and V matrices, the solution of A⃗α = ⃗b can be obtained
from

⃗α =

M
∑

j=1

⃗Uj ⋅ ⃗b
σj

⃗Vj

(40)

where the ⃗Uj and ⃗Vj are obtained from the rows and columns of the U
and V matrices, respectively. If A has zero singular values, it is rank-
deficient and thus, A⃗α = ⃗b has infinite solutions. This results in type (II)
ill-posedness as defined by Hadamard [172]. This situation is likely to
happen in CSE if an insufficient number of reacting cells are present in
the ensemble. Even absent zero singular values, if the singular values
are nevertheless very small, then type (III) ill-posedness may still occur.
In practice, the right-hand side vector ⃗b contains numerical and physical
modelling errors δ⃗b. These errors may be amplified by small singular
values [173]

⃗α =

M
∑

j=1

⃗Uj ⋅ ⃗bexact
σj

⃗Vj +

M
∑

j=1

⃗Uj ⋅ δ⃗b
σj

⃗Vj

A solution for Eq. (40) can only be obtained if the Fourier coefficients
⃗Uj ⋅ ⃗b decays faster than the singular values σj , a condition known as
the Picard condition [174]. Labahn et al. [173] calculated the singular
values and Fourier coefficients of one CSE ensemble in a non-premixed
CH4-air jet flame with 200 grid points in the mixture fraction sample
space. The conditional average of CO2 mass fraction ̃YCO2|ζ is taken
from the experiments to calculate ⃗bexact. A random noise based on a
normal distribution with standard deviation of 10−10 is superimposed
on ⃗bexact. Fig. 13 shows the singular values and the Fourier coefficients.
As seen in Fig. 13, the Picard condition is satisfied with ⃗bexact.
However, if the error perturbations δ⃗b are added to ⃗bexact, the Fourier
coefficients grow faster than the singular values and the Picard condi-
tion is no longer satisfied. As a result, type (III) ill-posedness occurs;
i.e., small perturbations completely destroy the solution.

2.9.2. Regularization

Many different numerical approaches exists to regularize the Fred-
holm integral equation [175]. As mentioned in Section 2.3, Tikhonov
regularization is the most widely-used approach in the CSE combustion

model. Another approach in the context of Eq. (40), is Truncated
Singular Value Decomposition (TSVD) [176]

⃗α =

k
∑

j=1

⃗Uj ⋅ ⃗b
σj

⃗Vj

(42)

where the singular values σj are ranked in descending order, and k < M
is the regularization parameter. In this approach, the small singular
values are truncated, with only the large values kept to construct the
solution. Filtering the small singular values satisfies the Picard condi-
tion. Both the TSVD and Tikhonov (Eq. (10)) with ⃗α0 = 0 approaches
can be formulated in terms of filter functions fj

⃗α =

M
∑

j=1

fj

⃗Uj ⋅ ⃗b

⃗Vj

where the fj for the TSVD approach is

0 if j > k

(41)

and for Tikhonov is

f (σj ) =

σ2
j
σ2
j + λ2

(43)

(44)

(45)

These two filter functions are plotted in Fig. 14. It is evident that the
Tikhonov regularization approach also filters the effect of the small
singular values on the solution, in line with the Picard condition.

The Tikhonov approach in Eq. (10) is termed the zeroth-order
Tikhonov approach. The a priori knowledge of the solution ⃗α0 can be
set to the null vector [177] to simply prevent the least-square algorithm
from over-fitting the solution with large fluctuations, as previously
shown in Fig. 2. Another widely-used option in CSE solvers is to use the
solution from the previous time step as the prior knowledge for ⃗α0 [41,
54,57,64,64,67]; this approach is similar to Kalman filtering [178].
Another choice for ⃗α0 is simplified laminar flames such as the Burke-
schumann diffusion flame [47,135] or the unstrained one-dimensional
laminar premixed flame [37,87,88].

Another variant of the Tikhonov approach, first-order Tikhonov,

This approach requires fewer memory resources compared to zeroth-
order Tikhonov because the solution of the previous time step need not
be stored for the next time step. First-order Tikhonov was also used in
CSE [53,167]. This approach is not recommended for CSE with flamelet
chemistry (i.e, LFD) because the contributions of the two flamelets next
to each other in the flamelet library are not necessarily required to be
correlated [64]. However, The solution of the zeroth-order Tikhonov
may not be smooth and an explicit smoothing operator may be required
in post-processing the conditional scalars [88,173].

Several other approaches are also available to solve this type
of inverse problem using Bayesian statistics [179] and neural net-
works [180], but their computational costs are prohibitively expensive
to be used in each time step/iteration in an unsteady/iterative steady
flow solver. Nevertheless, the Bayesian inverse problem can be used to
determine the uncertainties in the solution of the CSE inverse problem,
as shown in Fig. 15 [173]. If these uncertainties can be obtained in
real-time with economic computational costs, then a second-order CMC
approach may be utilized to reduce the CSE homogeneity assumption
error in large ensembles [181].

2.9.3. Regularization parameter

An important parameter in both the Tikhonov and the TSVD ap-
i.e, the parameter λ in
proaches is the regularization parameter;
Eqs. (10) and (46) and k in Eq. (42). This parameter can be simply
obtained from the following algebraic equation for the zeroth-order
Tikhonov approach [182]

λ2 =

T r(AT A)
T r(I)

(48)

where the T r operator is the trance of the matrix. This equation
provides a balance between the integral equation and the a priori
information. The minimization problem for the zeroth-order Tikhonov
can be re-arranged in the following form by left-multiplying Eq. (10)

Eq. (49) clearly shows how Eq. (48) provides a balance between the two
terms corresponding to the inverse problem and the a priori knowledge
of the solution. More advanced algorithms are also available to calcu-
late the regularization parameter such as the L-curve approach [175]
and the Generalized Cross-Validation approach [183]. These two ap-
proaches extract as much information as possible from A⃗α = ⃗b, and
apply enough a priori knowledge only to make the problem well-posed.
In the L-curve approach, the norm of the solution is plotted vs. the
least-square error in A⃗α = ⃗b for different values of the regularization
parameter. Fig. 16 shows L-curves of the zeroth-order Tikhonov and the
TSVD approaches for the CSE integral equation in one CSE zone in a tur-
bulent premixed flame [88]. With no regularization the solution norm
is large. As the solution is regularized by increasing λ in the Tikhonov
approach or decreasing k in TSVD, the solution norm decreases and
the regularization stops at the point where the least-square error in the
integral equation starts to increase. This point corresponds to the corner
of the L-curve, as shown in Fig. 16 indicating the optimal value for λ.
This approach was implemented in a CSE-LES simulation program to
automatically calculate λ in each time step [37].

2.9.4. Linear solvers

The Tikhonov regularization equations (Eqs. (10) and (46)) have
been solved using several different numerical approaches. To convert
the equations into an m × m linear system of equations, they are left-
multiplied by the transpose of the augmented matrix. For example, the
following equation is obtained for the first-order Tikhonov approach

(AT A + λ2LT L)⃗α = AT ⃗b

(50)

Since the number of unknowns in this system of equations is of the
order of 50 to 500, classical linear solvers such as LU-decomposition
solvers can be used to solve Eq. (50). Another approach with a slightly
lower computational cost is to directly apply a QR-factorization on
the augmented matrix [184]. For example, for the first-order Tikhonov
approach

These approaches may lead to negative solutions, especially for
small values of the conditional species mass fractions. Such non-
positivity behaviour deteriorates with poor regularization. To enforce a
positive solution for the conditional averages, NNLS can be used [166].
The numerical experiment showed that the computational cost of
the NNLS approach is, on average, ten times the QR-factorization
approach [61].

The computational cost of all these approaches increases as the
number of points in the ensemble increases. Tsui and Bushe [51]
suggested to use an iterative QR-factorization approach [63] for a large
((104) rows and higher) and sparse kernel matrix. This iterative solver
can be implemented in parallel using multiple processors to speed up
the calculations [185].

2.9.5. Regularization with polynomial expansion

Similar to the LFD approach presented in Section 2.8.2, where the
conditional scalars are modelled as a series expansion of the flamelet
solutions, other basis functions can also be used for the series expan-
sion. As a result, the need for having a grid in the conditional space is
eliminated. Ilgun et al. [186] used the Jacobi polynomials to represent
the conditional moments in the CMC approach. Mahdipour and Salehi
[61] used Bernstein polynomials to model the conditional scalars in the
CSE approach

where βj are the unknown coefficients and Bj,NB
polynomials of degree NB defined as

B2,4 and B3,4 are similar to the radical intermediate species’ conditional
mass fractions.

The similarity between Bernstein basis polynomials and species’
conditional mass fractions results in Eq. (53) being an excellent reduced-
order model for the conditional species mass fractions. Therefore, the
number of unknowns to be found for the species conditional mass
fractions in CSE can often be reduced to less than 10 [61].

Using Eq. (53) in the CSE integral equation (i.e. Eq. (7)) with the
CSE homogeneity assumption, the following linear system of equations
are obtained

where ⃗β is the vector of unknowns βj s. The integration in the above
equation can be done prior to the CFD simulations, and if the β
distribution is used for the presumed PDF can be done analytically [61].
Numerical experiments show that this polynomial representation of the
conditional averages is an effective regularization approach if NNLS is
used

in this way, no further regularization (such as the Tikhonov approach)
is needed. Another benefit of this approach is that the number of
unknowns is reduced from 50 in the regular CSE approach to less than
10. Consequently, the ensemble (i.e. test filter) size can be significantly
reduced resulting in a more localized CSE approach. Fig. 18 shows that
the number of LES cells per ensemble can be reduced considerably more
using the localized CSE approach compared to the conventional CSE
approach with Tikhonov regularization. The relative error is calculated
from an L1-norm of the difference between the modelled CO2 produc-
tion rate and the DNS values over all the LES cells relative to the norm
of the DNS data [61]. According to Fig. 18, the number of LES cells
per ensemble can be as low as 16 in this a priori analysis using DNS
data. Ensembles with 2 × 2 × 4=16 LES cells are easily formed from
DNS data, but in an actual LES the ensemble is formed by extending one
filter width in each direction resulting in at least 27 cells per ensemble.

using the factorial notation. For example, Bernstein basis polynomials
of degree NB = 4 are plotted in Fig. 17. As shown in Fig. 17, the
similarities between these basis polynomials and the conditional species
mass fractions are clearly seen in a turbulent flame. For example, in a
turbulent premixed flame, the B0,4 and B4,4 are similar to the reactant
and product species’ conditional mass fractions, respectively; and B1,4,

Labahn et al. [187] implemented CMC and CSE in the same CFD
code in RANS with the same numerical schemes, mesh, and boundary
conditions to minimize possible discrepancies between the two models.
They performed simulations of Sandia flames D, E and F for a side-by-
side comparison with experimental data to assess CMC and CSE in a fair
manner. For Sandia flame D, both sets of predictions for turbulent flow
and mixing fields, conditional and Favre averaged species mass frac-
tions, CMC and CSE produced similar results, as expected. There were
some differences noted for the conditional mass fractions of H2 and OH

due to the some inaccuracies in the TGLDM tables. Larger differences
were observed for flame E. The effects of local extinction seen in
decreased levels of temperature and major species mass fractions, were
reproduced by the CSE simulations, albeit too strongly. However, the
CMC results could not capture the correct trends. It was concluded that
CMC predictions were more sensitive to the inlet boundary conditions
and the conditional scalar dissipation modelling. Both models, in this
study, could not get good results for Sandia flame F. CMC was shown
to require more computational resources in comparison to CSE for
these flames in RANS. The mesh was more easily set up for conditional
averages in CMC, than what was needed for the CSE ensembles (see
Table 3).

These results of this side-by-side comparison study were focused on
numerical set-up and performance for the predictions of temperature
and species concentrations without NOx, soot and radiation. Radiation
can be addressed in a similar fashion in CMC and CSE. CMC can handle
conditional transport equations for NOx and soot easily and this is an
advantage compared to the current CSE implementations relying on
tabulated chemistry. One remedy would be to implement a CSE method
without chemistry tabulation and using direct chemistry, capable of
including detailed kinetics and differential diffusion in conditional
space. This is not trivial and currently being investigated [188].

3. Applications of the CSE model

3.1. Turbulent non-premixed combustion

3.1.1. A priori assessment using DNS data

The first publication of CSE as a combustion model was an a priori
test against DNS data—indeed, as mentioned earlier, this first paper
considered what later came be known as CSE as a mere extension of
CMC to the LES paradigm; Bushe and Steiner [22] tested the concept
of CSE against the DNS of Vervisch [189]. That DNS database was a
simple, shear-free temporal mixing layer (fuel mixing with oxidizer)

and included only one-step chemistry; the DNS domain was a mere
128 × 64 × 64 box. The test included applying a top-hat filter with
dimensions 16 × 8 × 8 to obtain a coarse ‘‘LES filtered’’ field. Within
each of these filtered ‘‘cells’’, unconditional averages were calculated
for each of the reactive scalars. The unconditional mean and variance
of the mixture fraction were also determined; these were used as inputs
to a β-PDF model. This data was then fed into the CSE algorithm, using
four ensembles (two narrow regions either side of the centreline of the
mixing layer and two large ones extending to the outflow boundaries
on either side) to perform an inversion for the conditional means of the
reactive scalars within each ensemble, invoke the first moment CMC
closure hypothesis to obtain the estimate for conditional mean of the
reaction rate, and finally combine the model PDF with this estimate to
get a prediction of the unconditional reaction rate in each LES ‘‘cell’’.
The results were then directly compared to the filtered reaction rates
by simply plotting all predicted filtered reaction rates with the directly
filtered counterpart, as shown in Fig. 19.

Bushe and Steiner [22] also considered the possibility of adding
scalar dissipation rate as a second conditioning variable, modelling
the PDF of χ as being log-normal, assuming that scalar dissipation
of mixture fraction has a simple functional dependence on mixture
fraction and is otherwise statistically independent of mixture fraction.
They repeated the test with this two-condition method and found that
the results improved marginally, particularly in regions where the
reaction rate was particularly low, as can be seen in Fig. 20.

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience104(2024)10117217

M.M. Salehi et al.

More recently, in trying to address non-premixed combustion at
extreme pressures, Bellan [190], Devaud et al. [47] and Bushe et al.
[135] again turned to doing a priori tests against DNS, this time against
the much larger DNS database of Bellan [191]. This database was
constructed to mimic combustion of heptane at high pressures; there
are four different simulations against which to compare, representing
pressures of 60 and 80 atm and turbulent Reynolds numbers of 1000
and 2000 (grid sizes range from 480 × 530 × 288 to 768 × 804 × 460).
While the chemistry in the DNS was still only one-step, the Peng–
Robinson real-gas equation of state was applied to represent the effects
of the extreme pressures and multi-component species mass diffusion
was accounted for with a fully populated diffusion matrix; the Soret
effect, the Fourier term and Dufour effects were also included.

Bellan [190] performed a test essentially identical to the one-
condition test of Bushe and Steiner [22], and found that, while CSE
performed very well when using the PDF taken directly from the DNS,
subsequently switching to the β-PDF led to significant errors in the
predictions of the reaction rates, suggesting that CSE can be extremely
sensitive to errors in the PDF model—and that the β-PDF may not be
an appropriate model for the mixture fraction PDF at high pressures.

Devaud et al. [47] then explored the potential for using a second
conditioning variable, looking at both a normalized product species
mass fraction and normalized temperature. The DCSE results repre-
sented considerable improvements over the single condition tests, how-
ever, in these tests, the joint PDF for the conditioning variables was
simply taken from the DNS. The study was expanded to include as
many aspects of the different modelling assumptions made as practi-
cal, and it was found that, again, the model for the joint PDF was
a major source of error [135]. Indeed, among the different sources
of error possible—including the selection of ensembles, the integral
equation inversion process and the modelling of the joint PDF—the
latter was found to have by far the greatest impact, with the model
for the reaction progress variable (modelled as being a β-PDF) and the
assumption of statistical independence between the two conditioning
variables having, in some cases, an extreme impact on the predictive
ability of the DCSE method. This is illustrated in Fig. 21. The first test
examines how well a two-condition conditional moment closure for the
chemical source term works, using 1, 8 and 22 ensembles, evaluating
the reaction rate expression using the DNS conditional averages of the
reactive scalars within each ensemble and calculating the ‘‘LES’’ filtered
reaction rate using the DNS-PDF, comparing that to the actual filtered
rate from the DNS. This is illustrated in Fig. 21 (upper figure) for 1
ensemble. Results collected in [135] show negligible changes in the
scatter plot between 1, 8 and 22 ensembles (the reader may refer to
Figs. 3–5 (a) in [135]). The second test (in the lower figure) shows what
happens when the statistical independence assumption is employed to
use a double-β PDF model; the points labelled DNS were obtained from
using the DNS conditional averages of the reactive scalars—so using the
same inputs to the model as was used in the upper figure, aside from
the PDF model; the points labelled DCSE show the full test, including
inversion for the conditional averages, assuming only one ensemble for
the entire domain.

Clearly, the main culprit behind the poor representation of the
reaction rates is the poor representation of the joint PDF. This has led
to considerable further effort in trying to improve the joint PDF model,
as discussed earlier.

3.1.2. Turbulent jet, bluff-body and buoyant flames

Şteiner and Bushe [53] applied CSE to Sandia flame D in LES using a
two-step chemical mechanism for methane–air combustion, as detailed
in Table 4. In this initial study, no tabulated chemistry was included.
The conditional filtered averages for the species mass fractions and
temperature were expressed as functions of two conditional variables,
one representing fuel consumption and one for oxidizer consumption.
Therefore, the number of integral inversions could be reduced by half:
one for each of these variables, instead of four if the reactive species

were considered. The mixture fraction grid consisted of 41 nodes,
refined around the stoichiometric value of 0.352. Each ensemble was
defined as a cylindrical slice with 2016 CFD cells. The predicted major
species mass fractions and temperature were in reasonable agreement
with experimental data. However, as displayed in Fig. 22, this work
showed the limitations of the extremely reduced kinetics for predictions
of minor species and indicated that the numerical parameters in CSE
needed further investigation.

Sandia flame D was further examined in LES-CSE by Wang et al. [54]
with tabulated detailed chemistry (GRI 3.0 and 2.11) using the TGLDM
method with two progress variables, mass fractions of CO2 and H2O. In
LES, in addition to the continuity, Navier–Stokes and mixture fraction
equations, transport equations were solved for temperature and mass
fractions of CO2, H2O and NO. The other minor species were retrieved
in conditional space from the TGLDM tables. This significantly reduced
computational time. The CSE-TGLDM code structure is presented in
Fig. 23. Good agreement with experimental data was obtained for all
species. Some discrepancies could be seen for H2 on the fuel-rich side,
probably due to the equal diffusivity assumption, as demonstrated in
Fig. 24.

Most recent CSE simulations for turbulent non-premixed flames
have relied on the TGLDM approach for tabulated chemistry with good
results, instead of using LFD for the chemistry. Wang and Bushe [168]

showed that the accuracy of the LFD approach went as far as the
accuracy of the underlying flamelet library. They demonstrated that
using a steady flamelet library [9] for non-premixed flames results in
under-prediction of the NO mass fraction. Then, they switched to an
unsteady flamelet library [75,193] and the NO mass fraction was over-
predicted. They also showed that one could effectively tune the solution
by including or excluding different flamelet solutions from the manifold
used as elements for decomposition; in particular, a combination of
steady and unsteady flamelet solutions could be formed to improve the
solution, but with no clear justification. Sample results at x∕D = 30 are
shown in Fig. 25. Similar trends exist at other axial locations (see for
example Figs 8, 13 and 14 of Ref. [168]).

The numerical implementation and performance of CSE were also
investigated in RANS for different turbulent non-premixed flames, with
auto-ignition [65,158] and in enclosed conditions [41]. Huang and
Bushe applied CSE with TGLDM to predict auto-ignition delays in
a transient turbulent methane jet inside a shock tube facility [65].
The predicted ignition delay was defined to be the time from the
start of injection until there was a significant change in the slope of
temperature or C2H2 mass fraction with respect to time. In this study,

both temperature and C2H2 were tested and it was decided to keep
C2H2 as an ignition marker accounting for the fact, in the experiments,
the light intensity was a result of emission from glowing particulate
matter, correlated to the concentration of C2H2, in methane–air flames.
This RANS-CSE-TGLDM approach was able to predict the experimental
ignition delay and ignition kernel locations reasonably well, given the
significant scatter in the experimental data. NOx predictions were also
considered in this work by solving an additional transport equation
for NOx in the CFD code. The mean NOx chemical source term was
determined by integrating the conditional NOx reaction rates with the
PDF over mixture fraction space. A correction based on isentropic gas
expansion was also added to account for cooling due to the rarefaction
wave that took place in the experiments. The cooling effect through
this correction significantly improved the NOx predictions, as shown
in Fig. 26.

The same approach was tested to predict auto-ignition delays in a
constant-volume combustion bomb facility using the experimental data
collected by Naber et al. [194] and good agreement between predicted
and measured auto-ignition delays was found. This RANS-CSE-TGLDM
approach was extended by Wang et al. [195] to account for variations
in chemical kinetics by using a Stochastic Particle Model (SPM) to
generate alternate trajectories in TGLDM. This modified formulation
was applied to the simulation of auto-ignition in the same transient
turbulent methane jet, previously investigated by Huang et al. [65].
Substantial variations in ignition delay time were predicted; however,
the magnitude of the variations about the mean remained several
times smaller than what was observed in the measurements, therefore
suggesting that the turbulent fluctuations had a significant impact on
the auto-ignition process. Later, the limitations of RANS were clearly
shown with poor agreement between experimental ensemble-averaged
OH mass fractions the initial RANS-CSE-TGLDM predictions obtained
in the transient turbulent methane jet in a shock tube [158].

Building upon these initial findings, CSE was further examined in
RANS for a non-premixed turbulent methane–air flame [41]. A sensi-
tivity analysis was performed related to the number of CSE ensembles
and mean fraction range for which CSE cells are declared active or not
in the ensembles for the integral inversion. The CSE ensembles were
created using the CFD grid domain, between 0 and 725 mm in the axial
direction, effectively introducing a spatial variation of the conditional
averages in the dominant flow direction. The number of CSE ensembles
was shown to have a significant effect on the results. For this particular
case, 24 ensembles of equal size produced the temperature predictions
in best agreement with experimental data [196] and further increase
to 32 ensembles yielded negligible temperature variations, smaller
than 1%, relative to the values obtained with 24 ensembles. In this
work, very lean mixture mixtures outside the flammability limits were
removed from the ensemble active cells used for inversion, keeping the
cells with 0.015 ≤ Z < 1 for computational cost reduction without
any impact on the predictions. In these RANS-CSE calculations, no soot
model was included and further improvements would be seen with
a soot model farther downstream in the flame where soot concentra-
tions are the largest. Soot modelling within CSE will be discussed in
Section 3.1.3.

The applicability of CSE was investigated for two well-characterized
turbulent methanol flames by Lee and Devaud [159], one piloted
flame, denoted by M1 in the experiments [197], and one bluff-body
flame [198]. Compared to methane combustion, methanol flames have
a wider flammability range with a stoichiometric mixture fraction value
of 0.135. For the piloted flame, four different ensemble sizes were
tested in the axial direction, covering the entire radial distance with
a slight overlap between the ensembles. The Favre-averaged species
concentrations and temperatures changed by less than 1% between 40
and 80 ensembles, therefore 40 ensembles were selected for the piloted
flame simulations. Likewise, the CSE ensemble sensitivity test was
applied in the bluff-body flame case and 40 ensembles were also found
to be best suited for these simulations. With a GRI-Mech 2.11 chemistry

mechanism tabulated via the TGLDM method, the CSE conditional and
unconditional mass fractions of species and temperature were in good
agreement with experimental data at different axial locations. Large
discrepancies could be seen for H2 in both flames, believed to be due
to inaccuracies in reaction constants in GRI-Mech 2.11 and neglect of
differential diffusion. The CSE conditional and unconditional species
mass fractions and temperature for both flames were also comparable
to previously published CMC results [199,200] which is expected for
non-premixed turbulent flames without extinction or reignition.

As a very first step towards fire modelling, CSE was also imple-
mented in LES to simulate a buoyancy-driven turbulent line flame
burning methane [69]. The experimental test case was characterized
by the University of Maryland, typically referred to as UMD flame and
this is one of the target flames/fires discussed at the Measurements
and Computations of Fire Phenomena (MaCFP) [202], working group
part of the International Association for Fire Safety Science (IAFSS).
In fact, the UMD target flame consists of several conditions related to
the concentration of nitrogen in the coflow to examine the extinction
behaviour. In the work of Abdalhamid and Devaud [69], the case
without extinction was considered, being simpler as a first CSE val-
idation for this type of flame and more experimental measurements
are available for this condition. The objective was to assess the LES-
CSE approach for this buoyancy-driven flame in a simple configuration
with different strategies for radiation modelling while keeping detailed
chemistry and including effects of sgs turbulence-radiation interactions
(TRI). For this study, the LES solver was FireFOAM [203], being one
of the common LES tools developed for fire simulations. Radiation was
accounted for in four different ways. In the first method, a radiative
source term was determined using unconditional quantities for the
filtered enthalpy equation combined with adiabatic TGLDM tables.
The second approach, the same source term was calculated with non-
adiabatic TGLDM tables. Non-adiabatic TGLDM tables were generated
using a conditional enthalpy loss defined as the different between
the conditional adiabatic enthalpy (reference value) and the actual
conditional enthalpy, similar to what was done for turbulent spray
flame calculations [52]. With non-adiabatic tables, the conditional
reaction rates and species mass fractions change according to radiation
losses. In the last two methods considered in [69], the radiation loss
term for the filtered enthalpy equation was determined in conditional
space to include the effect of TRI, combined with adiabatic or non-
adiabatic TGLDM tables. For the conditional radiation loss calculation,
the conditional temperature was needed and was obtained by integral
inversion. This strategy was derived to evaluate which part of the

radiation loss calculation was most important for this specific case of
turbulent buoyant methane line flame. In all cases, no radiative transfer
equation was solved and an optically thin approximation was applied
for radiation. Good agreement was obtained between predictions and
experiments for temperature and rms, and flame height. Fig. 27 gives
an indication of the instantaneous flame structure given by LES-CSE
compared with a snapshot from the experiments. Due to low radiation
losses in atmospheric methane–air combustion and simple set-up, the
effect of TRI was found to be small, only a 7% temperature peak
reduction and the inclusion of non-adiabatic TGLDM tables had a slight
impact on the unconditional predictions. However, these initial CSE
calculations with radiation provide a good basis for further radiation
modelling developments for more complicated situations.

Recently, motivated by the benefits of Bernstein polynomials to ap-
proximate the conditional averages and the need for improved compu-
tational efficiency in CSE calculations, two different CSE formulations
were investigated in the framework of RANS calculations applied to
Sandia flames D and F [177]. One CSE method considered a first-
order Tikhonov regularization, instead of zeroth-order used until now
in CSE applications. The second implementation included Bernstein
polynomials. In addition to these two CSE formulations, the existing
CSE routines in OpenFOAM were also modified to include an optimized
search and storage method using hash tables for tabulated chemistry
(still with TGLDM) and pre-tabulated integrated presumed PDF (instead
of on-the-fly PDF integrations). First-order Tikhonov regularization
was shown to yield smooth conditional profiles without additional
smoothing required in conditional space on the regularized solution.
Further, with a zero a-priori solution, this technique minimizes user’s
input or any external information which is important for the sought
generalization of CSE applications. For Bernstein polynomials, the de-
gree of polynomial was selected to be equal to 10 following the a-priori
analysis by Madhipour and Salehi [61]. Both implementations resulted
in predictions of temperature and species mass fractions very close
to each, with occasional small advantages for the Bernstein polyno-
mials. Good agreement with experiments was found for flame D, but
as expected, larger discrepancies could be seen for flame F, due to
the limitations of RANS and single conditioning in the occurrence of
transient extinction/ignition phenomena. It was also important to check
the computational cost of these two techniques that produced similar
level of prediction accuracy with the new storage and search algorithm
implemented. It was interesting to see that the computational cost of
the CSE routine had gone down from 85% (from previous CSE calcula-
tions using zeroth-order Tikhonov and without any optimization [187])
to 10% when first-order Tikhonov regularization was used and under
3% with Bernstein polynomials, of the total computational cost of the

simulations. The cost of the inversion process was also found to be very
small, no matter which technique was implemented. These are impor-
tant and encouraging findings for future CSE applications aiming at
larger and more complex combustion systems with potentially the need
of multiple conditioning variables and direct chemistry integration.

3.1.3. Turbulent sooting flames

Yao et al. [204] proposed what they refer to as an ‘‘alternative’’
CSE, in which they used what amounts to a standard CMC approach to
calculate conditional mean scalars – temperature, density and gaseous
species mass fractions – and used these as inputs to a simple model
for particulate matter formation to calculate conditional source-terms
for soot; then they took the modelled PDF for the mixture fraction
to obtain the unconditional source-term. This alternative CSE method
gave predictions that were of comparable quality to those of CMC in
the RANS context when using extremely simplified chemistry for PM;
since it was more computationally efficient than solving CMC equations
for the soot mass fraction (which requires dealing with differential
diffusion effects, and therefore adds complexity to the CMC method that
can be avoided using the alternative CSE approach), Yao et al. [204]
suggested this to be an acceptable compromise. It is worth noting that
the chemistry they used for soot was simplified to the point that the
rate of oxidation did not depend on the soot mass fraction itself; had
they used chemistry in which the rate expressions depend on soot mass
fraction (or indeed any other variable that might describe local soot
properties, such as number density), they would have needed to do
inversion for conditional means and the computational advantage they
found with CSE over CMC would be affected – possibly even nullified.
However, the use of such simplified chemistry for soot formation is
not uncommon in fire modelling, which suggests that this simplified
alternative CSE approach could be useful in such applications.

Recently, a two-equation semi-empirical soot model was coupled
with CSE in RANS for two turbulent flames, one operating at atmo-
spheric pressure and one at 3 atm (with higher soot levels compared to
atmospheric conditions) [205]. The two turbulent methane–air flames
of Brookes and Moss [196] were selected due to detailed measure-
ments of mixture fraction, temperature and soot volume fraction in
the flames, availability of previously published soot predictions with
other modelling approaches [206,207] and simple configuration for
this very first CSE-soot implementation. In order to account for the
large radiative losses due to non-negligible soot concentrations, in par-
ticular at 3 atm, non-adiabatic TGLDM tables were considered including
six different levels of total enthalpy, one for adiabatic conditions and
five different radiation levels. The semi-empirical soot model by Leung
et al. [208] was selected including particle inception, agglomeration,

surface growth and oxidation. Two additional transport equations,
one for soot mass fraction (Ys) and one for particle number density
(Ns), were solved. The conditional source terms were split into differ-
ent components for particle inception, surface growth, oxidation, and
agglomeration. The soot inception and growth were assumed to be first-
order functions of the acetylene (C2H2) concentration. The soot surface
growth term was proportional to the square root of the soot surface
area to account for the reduced reactivity of soot particles due to the
effect of ageing throughout the flame [208]. The oxidation steps for
O2 and OH were taken from [209]. Another source term in the soot
number density equation was included to account for the decrease in
soot particles due to particle agglomeration. The soot volume fraction
was expressed by fv = Ys × ρ∕ρs. The CSE-soot coupling is shown
in Fig. 28. For radiation modelling, the grey, optically thin radiation
model was included with losses associated to H2O and CO2 as well as
soot. The Planck mean absorption coefficient for soot was determined
by KP ,soot = 2370 1
.fv.T [210]. Following the previous RANS-CSE
mK
study (without soot) [41], the ensembles were set as planes normal to
the axial direction. After re-doing a sensitivity analysis on the number
of ensembles, 24 ensembles were created. Starting with the results for
the atmospheric flame, good agreement between predicted temperature
and measurement was noted. At all locations, the predicted centreline
temperature was within 5% of the experimental value resulting in good
prediction of flame height. Flame width was reasonably well captured
too given the RANS framework.

Considering the limited availability of experimental soot data (3
data points only), reasonable agreement with experiments was noted
at the first axial locations, x = 300 and 350 mm, keeping in mind the
large experimental error of 50% on soot volume fractions, as presented
in Fig. 29. In the experimental measurements, the highest fv value
available was shown at x = 425 mm, while the CSE peak value was
located slightly closer to the fuel inlet, at x = 390 mm, with a lower
magnitude, approximately 56% lower. For additional comparison, the
radial predictions at different axial locations are given in Fig. 30. Con-
sistent with the centreline values, the predicted soot volume fractions
were smaller than the experimental data. At x = 300 mm, the predicted
values were within the experimental error. However, at x = 350 and
425 mm, larger discrepancies with the measurements were observed.

For example, at x = 425 mm, the predicted fv is 54% smaller than
the measurement. The peak in soot concentration was shown to occur
earlier in the domain compared to the experimental observations. To
note, Kronenburg et al. [207] also mentioned that ‘‘The bulky shape of
the measured fv profiles is, however, an artefact of the measurements’’
due to data processing and low soot concentrations.

Also included in Figs. 29 and 30 are the previously published
predictions using CMC [207] and steady flamelet model [196]. These
previous numerical studies were also undertaken in RANS with k-ε
model with the optically thin radiation assumption, and only some
small differences in the soot chemistry. In particular, the surface growth
term was determined by a linear function of As in [206,207], instead
of including the square root of As. Further, soot oxidation was either
neglected or significantly reduced in [206] to get closer agreement
with the experimental data. Beyond these, the main difference was the
inclusion of differential diffusion in the CMC work [207]. The shape of
the predicted fv profiles were similar for the three numerical studies. At
1 atm, the soot levels are low. Further insight is obtained for the 3 atm
flame in which higher soot volume fractions are present and additional
experimental measurements are available (see Figs. 31 and 32).

For the 3 atm flame, the predicted centreline temperatures were
within 1.3% of the experimental values. The experimental peak temper-
ature reached the centreline around x = 250 mm to be compared with
280 mm in the simulations yielding good flame height prediction. The
flame width was also well captured. For the soot predictions, the axial
centreline profiles of fv were in good agreement with the experimental
data until x = 300 mm, within the experimental error of 50%, as
seen in Fig. 31. The predicted centreline fv values are shifted slightly
downstream in comparison to the experimental profile. The predicted
centreline fv peak is at x = 300 mm, whereas the experimental peak was
located between x = 200 mm and x = 250 mm. However, the predicted
peak value, irrespective of the location, was within the experimental
error. Considering this shift in predicted profile, the CSE predictions
reproduced the magnitude and shape of the experimental values.

Given the good agreement between the predicted temperatures and
experimental values, the discrepancies observed in the fv profiles were
not believed to be due to the impact of temperature difference. Instead,
these may be explained by the use of k-ε, experimental errors, lack of
differential diffusion modelling and the pre-exponential rate constants
that have not been specifically determined for these two methane–air
flames. The surface growth dependence on the surface area had a clear
impact on the magnitude of the soot volume fractions.

In Ashrafizadeh’s PhD research [211], a more detailed soot model,
the Quadrature Method of Moments (QMOM) [212,213], that accounts
for soot aerosol dynamics was implemented in the CSE framework. This

method solves transport equations for the moments of the population
balance equation and the source terms of the moments were closed
using quadrature approximation. The test case was the Sandia turbulent
ethylene diffusion flame [214]. This flame has higher values of soot
compared to the low sooting flame of methane at 1 atm, and is known
as a moderate sooting flame. The predictions of soot volume fraction
using the CSE-QMOM method matched the experimental data well.
Further, for comparison, the simulations were run using the Leung
et al. [208] semi-empirical model. The CSE-QMOM provided signif-
icantly improved results over those obtained by the semi-empirical
model.

3.2. Turbulent premixed combustion

3.2.1. A priori assessment using DNS data

The first application of the CSE model to turbulent premixed com-
bustion was the a priori assessment of Jin et al. [87]. They used the DNS
data of a freely propagating flame in homogeneous isotropic turbulence
in a cubic box [109]. The DNS was generated using a simple two-step
chemistry mechanism for CH4-air [215] with modified constants to be
able to resolve the flame in the DNS grid. The details of the mechanism
are shown in Table 5.

The inversion kernel was constructed from the modified flamelet
PDF described in Section 2.7.2. The zeroth-order Tikhonov regular-
ization (i.e. Eq. (10)) was used with the unstrained flamelet solution
as the a priori knowledge of the solution. Fig. 33 presents the CSE
predictions of conditional reaction rates compared to the DNS values.
As seen in Fig. 33, the CSE results compare favourably with DNS with
slight over-predictions.

The a priori analysis of Jin et al. [87] was performed in the RANS
context; the scalars were averaged over planes normal to the flame

propagation direction. Mahdipour and Salehi [61] conducted a similar
a priori analysis in the LES context. The DNS data was filtered using
a top-hat filter with Δ∕δT = 0.7. The data is then coarsened resulting
in an LES grid with 8 × 8 × 16=1024 cells. Similar to the DNS
of Grout [109], a statistically planar turbulent premixed CH4-air flame
was simulated, but with more realistic chemistry over a wide range of
turbulent intensities [24]. The chemical kinetics mechanism consists of
35 elementary reactions with 16 species. Four single realizations of the
DNS data at Karlovitz numbers 6, 74, 540, and 4100 were available.

This DNS database was used to investigate the modelling errors
in the CSE combustion model. There are four different sources of
errors: (1) The error in the first moment CMC hypothesis (2) the CSE
homogeneity assumption, i.e., the conditional scalars are constant in
each ensemble (3) the error in the presumed PDF model, and (4) the
error in solving the CSE inverse problem. The first two and partly
the third error also exist in the Coarse-Grid (CG) CMC model. The
filtered CO2 production rate was calculated in three different ways to
understand the relative magnitude of these errors:

(ρ|ξ, ̃Yk|ξ, ̃T |ξ)

1. The conditionally-filtered density ρ|ξ, species mass fractions ̃Yk|ξ
and temperature ̃T |ξ were directly calculated from the DNS data
at all the 1024 LES cells. The first moment CMC hypothesis
with the detailed chemistry model was used to approximate the
conditionally-filtered CO2production rate in each LES cell:
̃̇ωCO2 |ξ ≈ ̇ωCO2
The exact PDF extracted from the DNS data was then used to
̃̇ωCO2 |ξ ̃Pξ(ξ)dξ.
calculate the filtered production rate: ̃̇ωCO2
The only modelling error in this analysis is thus the first-order
CMC hypothesis The results, shown in the first row of Fig. 34,
demonstrate that this modelling error is insignificant, and the
first-moment CMC hypothesis with single conditioning works
well for turbulent premixed flames at low and high values
of Karlovitz number. Similar results were obtained by Swami-
nathan and Bilger [216] for H2-air flames at low Karlovitz
numbers.

= ∫ 1

(57)

2. In order to estimate the CSE homogeneity assumption error,
the DNS data was used to calculate the conditionally-filtered
scalars at the ensemble (i.e. coarse grid) level. Here, one single

ensemble was formed from all the 1024 LES cells and it is as-
sumed that ρ|ξ, ̃Yk|ξ and ̃T |ξ are constant in the ensemble. Then,
Eq. (57) was used to calculate one single ̃̇ωCO2 |ξ for the entire
DNS domain. The filtered production rate is then evaluated using
this number and the DNS-PDF obtained locally at each LES cell.
The second row of Fig. 34 shows that this error is significant
when a large ensemble with 1024 LES cells is used.

3. Finally, The conditional scalars (i.e., ρ|ξ, ̃Yk|ξ and ̃T |ξ) were
calculated from the unconditional ones (i.e., the filtered and
coarsened DNS values for ρ, ̃Yk and ̃T ) using the CSE integral
equation, Eq. (9). Here, the DNS-PDF was again used, and the
unstrained laminar flamelet solution is utilized as the a priori
knowledge of the solution ⃗α0 for the Tikhonov regularization.
The results, shown in the third row of Fig. 34, indicate that the
CSE predictions are comparable to the coarse-grid CMC results
(i.e. second row). Therefore, the modelling error in the CSE
inversion process is not significant.

Similar results were obtained for other reaction rates and species mass
fractions. The analysis was also repeated using a presumed β-PDF,
which slightly increased the modelling error, as shown in Fig. 14
of Ref. [61]. It is noted that in an actual LES, both the CSE and
CMC combustion models involve other modelling errors. These errors
arise from modelling the diffusion and mixing terms in the transport
equations for the conditional (Eq. (2)) and unconditional (Eq. (5))
scalars in the CMC and CSE models, respectively. Such terms also exist
in the transport equations for the first and second moments of the
conditioning variable that are solved in both models to construct the
presumed-PDF – Eqs. (20) and (21) in the non-premixed and Eqs. (26)
and (27) in the premixed combustion regime.

Mahdipour and Salehi [61] also compared the performance of the
conventional regularization approach and regularization with the Bern-
stein polynomial expansion – also known as the localized CSE, as
described in Section 2.9.5 – in their a priori analysis. The results
were compared with the filtered and coarsen DNS in Fig. 35. In the
conventional CSE approach, 1024 cells existed in an ensemble, but this
number could be as low as 16 in the localized CSE approach. Therefore,
significantly smaller ensembles were used, and as a result, Fig. 35
shows that this new approach can better predict the distributed CO2
production peaks. These distributed peaks resulted from the highly-
turbulent flow field in the Ka=4100 DNS case where strong turbulent
eddies shred the flamelets, as shown in the DNS progress variable and
̇ωCO2

contours in Fig. 35.

3.2.2. Laboratory-scale flames

After the successful a priori assessment of Jin et al. [87], the next
step forward was to implement the CSE model in a reacting flow solver
to investigate whether the model was stable and converged to the
correct solution. As a matter of fact, the over-predictions shown in
Fig. 33, could have happened in each time step/iteration loop for the
progress variable source term (Eq. (26)) leading to divergence of the
reacting flow solver. Salehi et al. [88] implemented the premixed CSE
in OpenFOAM [217] using the TGLDM chemistry model and a RANS
turbulence model. They simulated the F3 flame of the turbulent Bunsen
burner of Chen et al. [218]. They used the Tikhonov regularization ap-
proach with the unstrained flamelet solution as the a priori knowledge
of the solution.

Numerical experiments showed that the number of reacting cells
was not large enough to calculate the CSE integral equation at different
axial locations because the RANS simulation was performed in a two-
dimensional axisymmetric geometry. Thus, the entire computational
domain was therefore selected as one global ensemble. The estimated
conditional averages are shown in Fig. 36. It is evident that the CSE
solution was not regularized enough, and thus an explicit filter was ap-
plied to the solution to obtain a smooth solution. Nevertheless, the main
conclusion from this study is that the CSE combustion model is stable

and the radial profiles of two selected major species mass fractions and
two minor species. H2O, CO2 and OH predictions compare well with
the experimental results. The minor over- and under-predictions in the
radial profiles were mainly attributed to the limitations of the simple
RANS model used in the correct estimation of turbulent mixing. How-
ever, The CO mass fraction was significantly over-predicted at all axial
locations. Other simulations of this flame with different combustion
models also reported similar over-predictions [219–222]. The reason
may likely be due to uncertainties in experimental measurements.

A similar simulation was performed by Dovizio et al. [163] using
the same CSE-TGLDM solver in the RANS context. They simulated a
bluff-body stabilized flame, where the velocity and OH fields were
measured [223,224]. This flame is in the thin reaction zone regime
with a Karlovitz number higher than the F3 flame. Nevertheless, the
conditional H2O mass fraction was very similar to the unstrained
flamelet solution. The mean velocity field and a progress variable field
– calculated from the OH field – were in reasonable agreement with the
experimental measurement using a tuned k − ω model.

Dovizio et al. [89] also simulated the turbulent premixed V-flame
of Robin et al. [142] using the same solver. Similar to the previous
work, the CSE results for the conditional averages were close to the
unstrained flamelet solution. This flame was relatively larger compared
to the previous two flames and thus more reacting cells were available
for the CSE integral equation. As a result, the domain was decomposed
into 8 CSE ensembles. They reported that using more than 8 ensembles
led to numerical instability of the solver which is due to not having
enough reacting cells in each ensemble and therefore, non-physical
solutions were obtained from the CSE integral equation. They also
performed a sensitivity analysis on the choice of the scalar dissipation
rate model on turbulent flame speed. They compared the simple linear
relaxation model ̃χc = ( ̃ε∕̃k) ̃cv, the model of Vervisch et al. [118], and
the model of Kolla et al. [117]. They concluded that the model of Kolla
et al. [117] performed the best.

The CSE-TGLDM model was then implemented in an in-house LES
solver [225,226] by Salehi [181] and Shahbazian et al. [37]. This solver
was first used in the LES-CSE of the F3 flame. The mesh was decom-
posed into 128 disc-like ensembles in the axial direction — similar
to the ensembles shown in Fig. 4b. In contrast to the RANS results,
the conditional H2O mass fractions at different axial locations exactly
followed the unstrained flamelet profiles, as displayed in Fig. 38(a).
The LES data could be used to map the location of the flame in
the regime diagram proposed by Pitsch and Duchamp De Lageneste
[227], as shown in Fig. 38(b). As seen in Fig. 38(b), the F3 flame
is predominantly in the low-Karlovitz flamelet regions of the regime
diagram. Recent analysis using DNS data confirms that for such low

values of the Karlovitz number, the conditional scalars are very similar
to the unstrained flamelet solutions [171].

The LES-CSE approach was also used in the simulation of the Gülder
Bunsen burner with higher inflow turbulence intensity levels [228].
The inflow mixture in this burner is partly blocked by a metal mesh
screen for turbulence generation. Unlike the F3 flame, the estimated
conditional H2O mass fraction profiles in this flame were deviated from
the unstrained flamelet values, as depicted in Fig. 38(a). The regime
diagram in Fig. 38(b) shows that this flame is mainly in the Thin
Reaction Zone regime and is partly extended to the Broken Reaction
Zone regime. Although the existence of the ‘‘Broken Reaction Zone’’
regime is argued by Skiba et al. [229] for back-supported turbulent
premixed flames at such Karlovitz numbers, it is evident that the flame
is highly stretched under such extreme turbulence conditions. To our
knowledge, the effect of turbulence-induced stretch on such a map in

the composition space (i.e. Fig. 38(a)) is not reported in any experi-
ment. However, this effect can be estimated using counter-flow flames
in a reactant-to-product configuration. It is shown that such a canonical
configuration can represent the DNS data reasonably well [230]. Fig. 39
shows these flamelets at different values of strain rate — which are
varied by changing the mass flow rates of the reactants and products. As
seen in Fig. 39, the flamelet profiles on the H2O-progress variable map
tends to a straight line connecting reactants and products. This trend
is also observed in direct numerical simulations [171,231]. Comparing
Fig. 39 with 38(a) indicates that the flame in the Gülder burner is more
strained at lower axial locations. This is likely due to the grid-generated
nature of inflow turbulence in this burner; it decays exponentially
because there is no significant shear layer downstream [232].

The time-averaged velocity and species profiles of the LES-CSE
simulations of the F3 flame were also similar to the LES-flamelet results

This was obviously expected as the conditional H2O mass fraction
results were similar to the unstrained flamelet solutions. Fig. 40 shows
an instantaneous density contour and the mean CH4 mass fraction at
two sample axial locations. More detailed results of other major and
minor species are presented and discussed in Ref. [102]. The two radial
profiles shown in Fig. 40 clearly show that the fuel mass fraction
is over-predicted. This over-prediction is most likely due to using a
simplified sub-grid scale scalar dissipation rate model in Eq. (27)

phenomenon; thus, the sub-grid scale wrinkling was not properly
modelled. This is likely the reason behind the underestimation of the
fuel consumption rate shown in Fig. 40. This model was later on
modified by Dunstan et al. [119] to include other physical phenomena
such as curvature, dilatation and chemical reaction, as described in
Section 2.7.2. Repeating the simulation with this scalar dissipation rate
model is a matter for future investigation.

The only scalar measured in the Gülder burner is temperature.
The time-averaged LES-CSE and LES-flamelet results for this scalar are
calculated and compared with the experiment. Fig. 41(a) shows the ⟨ ̃cT ⟩

here Tu and Tb are the burned and unburned temperature values.
Fig. 41(a) shows that both models over-predict the flame height. These
results are consistent with the F3 simulation results in Fig. 40, and as
explained above, the over-prediction is likely due to the poor scalar
dissipation rate sub-model. The LES-CSE simulation of the Gülder flame
was repeated with the LEM-SDR model of Tsui et al. [121], and the
mean normalized temperature field is compared with the experiment
in Refs. [185,233]. Fig. 41(b) shows that the results are significantly
improved. The experimental results shown in Fig. 41(a) were obtained
from the Rayleigh scattering approach by Yuen and Gülder [228],
whereas in Fig. 41(b) the Mie scattering approach by Tamadonfar and
Gülder [234] was used, and thus are slightly different.

Recently, Latifi and Salehi [68] revisited the RANS-CSE simulation
of the F3 and Gülder Bunsen flames using the new localized CSE
approach described in Section 2.9.5. Since this approach is based
on a Bernstein polynomial expansion for the conditional averages,

the number of unknowns are much smaller than the regular CSE
approach, and thus smaller ensembles are required compared to the
regular CSE. Fig. 42 presents the estimated conditional averages using
this approach at different zones (i.e ensemble). According to Fig. 42,
this new approach correctly predicts the flamelet conditional aver-
ages approximately similar to the LES-CSE results given in Fig. 38(a).
The computational cost of the new approach is also reduced by 20%
compared to the regular CSE approach.

The same approach was also used to model the Gülder burner,
which is mainly in the thin reaction zone regime. The conditional aver-
ages are shown in Fig. 43(a) and the predicted flame shapes – obtained
from the iso-line of the temperature-based mean progress variable equal
to 0.5, as explained above – are compared with the measurements in
Fig. 43 (b). Similar to the LES results previously shown in Fig. 38(a), the
conditional averages exhibit significant deviation from the unstrained
flamelet values. The predicted flame height was under-predicted when
the unstrained flamelet was used for ̃YH2O|ξ, but showed significant
improvement with CSE. The accurate prediction of the flame height
indicates that the turbulent flame speed is very well predicted by the
CSE model. It is worth noting that more advanced flamelet models
proposed in the literature incorporate the flame stretch effects to im-
prove predictions of the turbulent flame speed at high Karloitz numbers
compared to the simple unstrained flamelet model [221,235,236].

3.3. Turbulent partially-premixed combustion

Following the separate applications of CSE to non-premixed and
premixed combustion regimes, CSE was further extended to partially-
premixed and stratified turbulent flames for which double conditioning
was implemented leading to DCSE. As part of double conditioning
on two variables, commonly mixture fraction and progress variable,
several modelling aspects need to be examined carefully such as de-
termination of the joint mixture fraction-progress variable PDF and
closure of the progress variable transport equations. Before examining
some specific applications, Fig. 44 shows an overview of the DCSE
implementation (initially in RANS). The mean and variance of the
progress variable are needed to calculate the joint PDF. The DCSE
routine calculates the doubly conditional averages, starting from the
unconditional values and the kernel. First order closure remains for
conditional chemical source terms. Detailed chemical kinetics are incor-
porated using a chemistry tabulation technique, TGLDM. The resulting
TGLDM tables would be four dimensional, functions of progress vari-
able (c); mixture fraction (Z); YCO2 and YH2O. However, the progress
variable was selected to be equal to the CO2 mass fraction normalized
by its equilibrium value at a given mixture fraction. Thus, the TGDLM
tables were reduced to three dimensions with the conditional mass

fraction of CO2 being extracted from the value of the progress variable,
knowing the equilibrium value at a given mixture fraction. This means
that the only unknown parameter required to determine the conditional
chemical reaction rates is YCO2|Z, c obtained by inverting the integral
equation.

3.3.1. Stratified combustion

As a first step, these initial DCSE studies were conducted in RANS.
Dovizio et al. [89] applied DCSE to three different turbulent stratified
V-shaped methane–air flames for three different stratification condi-
tions characterized by an equivalence ratio gradient, ranging from a
maximum value at the centre of the combustion chamber (the three
different values were 1.0, 0.8 and 1.2) to a value equal to 0 at the pe-
riphery of the domain [142]. These experiments covered three different
levels of stratification from lean, stoichiometric and rich combustion
regimes and therefore creating strong equivalence ratio gradients and
a large study zone. Measurements were available for Reynolds mean
progress variable and mean axial and transverse velocity profiles. The
joint PDF was determined by two different expressions assuming sta-
tistical independence between mixture fraction and progress variable.
The second method for the joint PDF partly relaxed the assumption of
statistical independence, but still included the unconditional progress
variable variance in the PDF. The mixture fraction PDF was approxi-
mated by a β function and the progress variable PDF was calculated
using the modified laminar PDF. The simple algebraic model for the
scalar dissipation rate was used for both mixture fraction and progress
variable transport equations. Six CSE ensembles were shown to be
sufficient for these DCSE calculations. Close to the rod, where the
flame was narrow, a larger ensemble was defined to get enough points
that are non zero for the inversion process. For the three stratified
flames considered, the progress variable predictions were in reasonable
agreement with available experimental data and the predicted flame
was shown to be narrower than what was observed in the experiments.
It was concluded that the closure of the scalar dissipation found in
the transport equation of the progress variable variance needed to be
improved.

This led to the follow-up study [59] of DCSE applied to the same
turbulent stratified V flames with improved formulation of scalar dis-
sipation rate including a more detailed analysis with discussion of the
boundary conditions and effect of stratification on the flame thickness.
An extension of the scalar dissipation model initially proposed by Kolla
et al. [117] for premixed flames to partially premixed combustion was
applied.

The terms were expressed differently to extend model validity to
fuel rich and fuel lean stratified conditions. For partially premixed
combustion, characterized by a range of different values of the equiva-
lence ratio, the dependence on the equivalence ratio must be included
in the formulation that did not exist in the expression proposed by
Kolla et al. [117]. For the lean and rich cases, the mean progress
variable predictions were significantly improved compared to previous
DCSE results [89] and were in good agreement with experiments. This
indicates the significant impact of the scalar dissipation rate model
for the variance of the progress variable. Further, consistent with the
experimental observations, the flame thickness was found to be reduced
when the stratification increased, being the largest for fully premixed
combustion.

3.3.2. Turbulent lifted flames

In parallel, the applicability of DCSE was also investigated first
in RANS [40] then in LES [39] for the difficult problem of flame
stabilization by focusing on the prediction of lift-off height in turbulent
lifted flames. In lifted turbulent jet flames, the fuel injection or coflow
velocity is too high for the flame to stay attached at the burner rim.
Additional increase in the jet exit or coflow velocity will lead to flame
blowout/blowoff. The lift-off height is defined as the distance measured
between the burner rim and the base of the flame. The selected ex-
perimental cases were three turbulent jet flames (same configuration
for three different Reynolds numbers) burning methane issuing into
cold air with a small air coflow, equivalent to still air [237–239].
Experimental data were available for mean methane (CH4) concentra-
tion and lift- off height, and some information was also given for the
flame structure around the flame base such as the flammable region
width, averaged velocity, instantaneous velocity measurements using
Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and OH planar images. In RANS, the
2D grid was nonuniform, with high density of grid points close to the
central jet and the shear layer with a total number of cells of 22,400.
A simple linear model was applied for the scalar dissipation rate. Six
ensembles were defined as a result of sensitivity analysis. The joint PDF
is approximated using the same strategy as in [59,89]. The predicted
lift-off heights and radial locations of flame stabilization were in good
agreement with the experiments within the experimental uncertainty
with a larger noticeable discrepancy for the second flame (Reynolds
number being equal to 12,000). Several parameters related to flame
structure were consistent with the experimental observations: location
of predicted stabilization point on the fuel lean side, deflections of mix-
ture fraction isolines around the flame base and flame width increasing
with increasing Reynolds number.

This study was then extended to LES for further improvement of
turbulent flow/mixing fields and inclusion of transient effects [39].
This LES-DCSE also incorporated a more recent and detailed SDR
model based on the LES developments of Kolla et al. [117] and more
accurate closure of the transport equation of the progress variable.
The computational domain was cylindrical and consisted of 3,302,400
hexahedral cells. After a sensitivity analysis for the ensembles and
computational cost, 24 ensembles were defined. For consistency with
the previous RANS-DCSE calculations for the same flames [40] and
experiments [237–239], OH mass fraction (YOH ) equal to 0.0006 was
applied to estimate the flame base location. As can be seen in Table 6,

excellent agreement between the LES-DCSE results and experimen-
tal data is found for the three flames. The predicted flammability
region width matched the experimental measurements well within
experimental uncertainty with a clear improvement over the previous
RANS-DCSE, in particular for the two flames with the largest Reynolds
numbers due to better turbulent flow and mixing field description in
LES. Some instantaneous images of the flame base are also include in
Fig. 45 for the three Reynolds numbers.

3.4. IC engines, spray and MILD combustion

3.4.1. IC engines

Nivarti et al. [93] applied CSE to simulations of a homogeneous-
charged spark-ignition engine; the test-case for which experimental
data had been obtained was a Ricardo Hydra single-cylinder engine
with a flat piston (hence, the geometry for the simulation could be
very simple, with a moving mesh implementation in OpenFOAM). A
pressure trace and global NOx emissions had been obtained in the ex-
perimental measurements. The field was treated as fully premixed and
simulated with a simple RANS model. The spark ignition was modelled
by setting 5% of the field to fully burned, timing this jump to match
the experimental field. The CSE-RANS model, using a simple TGLDM
approach to the chemistry for methane/air, was then used to calculate
the flame propagation speed; this was then converted to a pressure
trace to compare to the experimental measurements of Reynolds [240].
CSE was able to predict the pressure trace very well and, while the
predictions of NOx emissions were low by a factor of 2–3, the trend in
NOx emissions as a function of changing the air/fuel ratio of the engine
was well predicted, as shown in Fig. 46.

In terms of compression ignition engines, simulations using CSE
on actual engine combustion have also focused on natural gas as the
primary fuel. Both RANS and LES paradigms have been explored with
varying success [241–245]. The approach has typically involved using
TGLDM for the chemistry and, in a method similar to what Nivarti et al.
[93] used, ignition is initiated artificially: natural gas does not ignite
sufficiently rapidly to be used as the sole fuel in a compression ignition
engine, and one needs to provide some kind of ignition source, such as
a small fraction of diesel to act as a pilot flame. The CFD calculations
in these studies are often used to better understand findings in the
experimental measurements from the engines. For example, McTaggart-
Cowan et al. [244] considered a dual-fuel system where a small diesel
pilot was first injected, followed by the main jet of natural gas, which
was ignited by the diesel pilot. The CFD calculations indicated that a
higher gas injection pressure improved mixing, especially in the later
stages of the combustion event, which led to significant reductions in
engine-out particulate and improvements in fuel consumption. How-
ever, the higher temperature in the combustion chamber also resulted
in an increase in NOx emissions and increased heat losses from the
combustion chamber, consistent with observations in the experiments.

jet, a low-temperature oxidation zone, and a high-temperature oxi-
dation zone. Both RANS and LES approaches produced quantitative
predictions of the auto-ignition delay time and flame lift-off length with
slight over-prediction in RANS, including two-stage ignition. The LES
temperatures were in good agreement with the Schlieren images for
the location and rate of flame propagation. Comparing the simulated
formaldehyde field with experimental measurements in Fig. 47 showed
that formaldehyde appearance prior to ignition is observed at the tip
of the fuel-rich gas jet; second-stage ignition was well captured by
the consumption of formaldehyde near the time of auto-ignition. The
predicted OH values were also in good agreement with experiments, as
shown in Fig. 48.

Turbulent spray jet flames have also been simulated using CSE/DCSE
with a Lagrangian description for the spray in RANS [122,156] and
LES [52]. First a series of turbulent acetone spray flames were con-
sidered, AcF1, 2, 3 and 5 from the University of Sydney [251,252].
These flames are noted to have a diffusion flame like structure and well
below blow-off which was useful for the non-premixed CSE formulation
using a single conditioning variable, mixture fraction. The selected
flames included dilute sprays only. TGLDM tables were generated
with the extended GRI-MECH 3.0 including an additional acetone
sub- mechanism of seven reactions [253]. An optically thin radiation
model was included. The computational domain was cylindrical with
a diameter of 140 mm and a height of 420 mm with a grid including
a total number of cells of 604,800. The particles were sent into the
domain at z/D = 0.3 where the particle statistics were measured. In
the simulations, the particles were injected with a constant velocity
for all sizes that matched the inlet jet velocity for each flame. Rosin–
Rammler size distribution was used to define the size distribution at
the jet exit. The Lagrangian equations were solved to determine the
droplet position, velocity, temperature and size of each parcel. The
liquid break-up was determined using Reitz and Diwakar model [254].
The turbulent dispersion of the droplets was represented by a stochastic
dispersion model.

The mean gas temperature profiles were well captured. However,
over-prediction near the peak was observed for all flames, in particular
at farther downstream locations. Further, the peak temperature was
also shifted radially outwards at downstream locations. The temper-
ature was slightly under-predicted for flames AcF1 and AcF2 and
significantly under-predicted for flame AcF5 near the jet-core. These
discrepancies were likely due to inaccuracies in the turbulent mixing
field due to RANS limitations, increased levels of premixing that could
not be captured in the non-premixed CSE version, the neglect of spray
effect on the conditional averages in the chemistry tabulation and a
larger experimental uncertainty in the temperature measurements in
high temperature regions. The mean droplets velocity profiles matched
the experiments well for the four flames.

3.4.2. Turbulent spray jet flames

In attempting to develop CSE for compression ignition engines
where the primary fuel is a liquid, it becomes necessary to also model
the ignition and flame propagation in a turbulent spray. One effort
to simulate the ignition of the 900 K Engine Combustion Network
‘‘Spray A’’ baseline conditions [248,249] used CSE in combination with
an FGM chemistry approach, comparing CSE-FGM to a homogeneous
reactor combustion model and a flamelet combustion model with the
same chemical mechanism [170,250]. Overall, the CSE-FGM model
reproduced the experimental trends better than the other two methods,
both quantitatively and qualitatively. The approach demonstrated the
capability of realistically predicting the essential structure of the diesel-
fuelled transient spray combustion processes, including the liquid fuel

Overall, the mean velocities were in good agreement with the exper-
imental data. It was clear that the accuracy of temperature prediction
was not as good with increased levels of premixing. Considering these
first results, improvements were undertaken in steps, (i) application of
DCSE in RANS coupled to the same Lagrangian solver to predict partial
premixing and possible blow-off and (ii) LES for better description of
the turbulence and mixing fields including the evaporation effects in
the chemistry tabulation.

As a step-wise approach, Hussien and Devaud [122] implemented
DCSE to deal with partially-premixed regimes, still in RANS, before
moving to LES and accounting for non-adiabatic effects in the chemistry
tables. The DCSE implementation was also improved compared to
previous DCSE studies [39,59]: transport equations of a non-normalized
progress variable and its variance were solved. This removed uncer-
tainties in the modelling of additional unclosed terms for the progress
variable statistics transport. The progress variable was defined as the
mass fraction of CO2. For validation, flames EtF1, EtF3, and EtF4
were selected with flame EtF1 being predominantly non-premixed and
flames EtF3 and EtF4 including increasing levels of premixing [252,
255]. The presumed joint PDF was calculated as the product of the sin-
gle PDF, both approximated by a β PDF, therefore assuming statistical
independence. Without additional information on joint statistics, it is
difficult to assess the validity of the statistical independence assump-
tion. Marinov kinetics for ethanol [256] including 56 species and 383
reactions was implemented through the TGLDM technique. The same
computational domain used in [156] was taken due to the same burner
configuration with the same bulk jet velocity. For the three flames,
DCSE resulted in improved mean temperature over CSE and the results
closely matched the experimental data, except for z/D = 10 near the
centreline for flames EtF1 and EtF3 where the DCSE temperatures were
clearly lower than the experimental values. Similar discrepancies in the
core jet were also observed in other previously published numerical LES
studies [257–259] and DNS [260], and it was also noted that the exper-
imental measurement errors were larger at these locations. However,
the DCSE improvements over CSE were smaller than initially expected
for EtF4 in which more partial premixing occurred. DCSE was shown
to reproduce some features of the complex flame structure found in the
selected flames, in particular a double peak in the mean HRR could be
seen in EtF1 and EtF4 at some locations and DCSE could include the
effect of larger conditional fluctuations more accurately than CSE. For
this flame EtF4, DCSE temperature predictions were found to be closer
to the experimental data in comparison to what was reported in the
studies using LES-FGM [261] and MMC-LES [258]. Additional compar-
isons are available in the DCSE study [122] with previously published
work relying on different turbulent combustion models. Chemistry,
sgs models and boundary conditions were not always the same and
this makes the comparison between models difficult. Droplet statistics
were also collected and compared with available experimental data.
Predicted mean droplet velocity and liquid volume flux were in good
agreement with experiments with similar discrepancies observed in
other LES.

It was a logical step to move up to LES and include non-adiabatic
chemistry tables for spray and radiation effects on the conditional aver-
ages. For this, Hussien and Devaud selected three other ethanol flames,
EtF3, EtF6, and EtF8, from the same experimental database [252,255].
These flames have the same fuel loading with different carrier mass
flow rates with differ-ent Reynolds numbers and varying levels of
pre-evaporation. For more challenging conditions, flame EtF8 has ex-
tinction and reignition events [255]. The effects of heat loss due to
spray evaporation and gas radiation were accounted for in the TGLDM
tables. For illustration, some instantaneous gas temperature profiles are
shown in Fig. 49. The turbulent flame structure was observed to be well
captured in comparison to experiments. As can be seen in Fig. 50, for
flame EtF3, LES improved he mean temperature profiles compared to
previous RANS simulations [122], but the centreline temperatures were
still under-predicted. The addition of enthalpy loss to the chemistry

tables improved the gas temperature predictions near the peak loca-
tions, however it also accentuated the existing underprediction near
the jet core. Examining the heat loss components, the evaporation heat
loss was found to be much larger than the radiative heat loss at all
locations. The profiles of spray mean velocity, rms, and Sauter mean
diameter were in good agreement with experiments. In this work, a
simple stochastic dispersion model was implemented and more complex
models could have an impact.

3.4.3. Moderate and intense low-oxygen dilution (MILD) combustion

A DCSE formulation was also developed in the context of multi-
stream combustion configuration, as found in MILD combustion when
the oxygen concentration in the coflow is not constant. In this case, a
second mixture fraction, W is defined to track the oxygen concentra-
tion, following the work of Ihme and See [262] such as

stream. One significant advantage of Eq. (60) is that W is conserved
and independent of Z. The two conditioning variables are Z and W.
Due to statistical independence, the joint PDF was determined as the
product of the two single PDFs, both determined by a β function. In
this case, the TGLDM manifolds become four-dimensional, functions of
Z and W, and two species mass fractions, YCO2 and YH2O. The selected
test case was the DJHC reacting case burning Dutch natural gas with
two different flames, DJHC-I 4100 (Re = 4,100) and DJHC-I 8800 (Re =
8,800) [263,264]. The first implementation was in RANS [67]. For the
DJHC-I 4100 flame, the radial CSE temperature predictions followed
the experimental data closely. For the DJHC-I 8800, larger discrepan-
cies were seen probably due to some inaccuracies in predicting the
entrainment of the ambient air and coflow due to RANS limitations.
The trend of lift-off height decreasing with increasing Reynolds number
was well captured, but the values were smaller than the experimental
values, noting that the lift-off height in the simulation was determined
based on OH concentration, different from what was done in the
experiments.

Further improvements were sought by applying the same formula-
tion to LES [57]. The predicted turbulent velocity field was improved
compared to those found in RANS [67] and the other turbulent velocity
statistics from LES were in good agreement with the experimental
profiles. The mean temperature profiles were also better predicted in
LES. Now, the lift-off height could be determined following the same
experimental method relying on the he probability of the presence of
flame pockets. Still, the predicted lift-off heights were found to be lower
than the measured values by 36 and 44% for the DJHC-I 4100 and
DJHC-I 8800 flames, respectively. These results may be explained by
several factors: the fuel composition (100% methane in LES, but diluted
in Dutch gas with other hydrocarbons), lack of turbulent fluctuations
set at the inlet and need of a third conditioning variable for more
accurate predictions of extinction and reignition.

Labahn and Devaud [187] applied single CSE to a semi-industrial
2 m × 2 m × 6.25 m furnace operating with a single burner [265].
At steady-state operation, a fuel input of 0.58 MW was supplied to
the furnace with 0.35 MW of vitiated air. The vitiated air consisted
of the following volume fraction distribution: 59.1% wet N2, 19.5%
wet O2, 6.4% wet CO2, 15% wet H2O and 110 vppm (volume parts per
million) dry NO [13]. The inlet temperatures for the fuel and vitiated
air were equal to 298.15 and 1573.15 K, respectively. In this furnace,
the radiative heat flux at the wall was estimated to be large, up to 300–
350 kW/m2 along the entire furnace [266]. Therefore, radiative effects
had to be included consistently with non-adiabatic TGLDM tables using
a third parameter characterizing radiation losses. Along the regular
gaseous species, NOx had to be considered as well by adding reactions
for thermal and prompt NO. The peak velocities and general shape
of the velocity profiles at each axial location were in good agreement
with the experimental data. The temperature and species mass fractions
profiles were also in good agreement for most axial positions. The
predicted peak temperature was closer to the centreline compared to
the experimental observations. This seems to point towards inaccura-
cies in mixing rate predictions The NOx concentrations were in good
agreement with the experimental measurements near the burner exit.
Farther downstream, the centreline concentration of NOx was close
to the experimental values when calculated following the method of
Peters and Weber [267]. Improved NOx predictions could be obtained
from the TGLDM tables by accounting for NO in the oxidizer stream
properly. Further improvements are expected by extending the current
formulation to LES so that the time-dependent and 3-D interaction
between the weak and strong jets can be modelled better.

4. Summary, recommendations and future directions

A comprehensive review of Conditional Source-term Estimation was
presented in this paper. Since its first introduction in 1999 by Bushe and
Steiner [22] as an alternative CMC formulation for LES, CSE has been

going through detailed investigations and has significantly evolved to
become a modelling framework on its own capable of handling turbu-
lent non-premixed, premixed, partially-premixed and spray flames with
radiative effects. There are clear potentials for future growth towards
more complex applications and CSE developments are the topics of
ongoing active research.

4.1. Summary

Before stating a few recommendations and examining potential
future research directions, the key elements of CSE approach are sum-
marized.

• Integral inversion

One key aspect is the integral inversion process that requires a regu-
larization technique and a sufficient number of data point in a given
ensemble. Several options have been tested and now available with
proven capabilities for the regularization such as Tikhonov zeroth and
first order techniques or Bernstein polynomials. There is an inherent
restriction on the minimum of points that must be selected for the
integral inversion to take place. If there is not sufficient information on
the turbulent mixing/reactive field provided as input in each ensemble,
CSE will not be able to provide accurate predictions for the reactive
species for this ensemble of points. This constraint on the minimum
number of points in a given ensemble is shown to be more critical in
RANS for which computational grids are smaller than those considered
in LES. In most CSE applications, the ensembles are defined prior to
the simulations with a simple domain decomposition, but there have
been some interesting methods [51,55] to define the CSE ensembles
more efficiently. Although the numerical implementation of CSE is the
subject of continuous improvement for best balance between accuracy
and computational cost, CSE has reached a certain level of maturity on
the aspect of regularization technique.

• Closure of joint or single PDF

Beyond the regularization technique and ensemble definition, the CSE/
DCSE performance is strongly linked to the closure of the joint or
single PDF. This has been shown to be the largest source of error in
a priori DNS calculations — indeed, the effects of this error can even
be larger than any improvements that can be associated with CSE. The
(joint or single) PDF is critical to calculate the unconditional scalars
(forward integral) and to determine the conditional mass fractions
(inverse problem). Until now, the vast majority of CSE/DCSE studies
have included the common and usual presumed shapes (β and laminar
flamelet forms) and statistical independence assumption. This is a key
issue, not unique to CSE/DCSE, that deserves additional efforts for
future developments.

• Chemistry tabulation

CSE has relied on static tabulated chemistry (FGM or TGLDM). This
has worked well for simple fuels like methane, methanol, ethanol and
acetone. The chemistry tables may be generated for non-adiabatic con-
ditions with a parameter characterizing enthalpy loss due to radiation
and fuel evaporation. TGLDM has shown some limitations when more
complex fuels and fuel blends are considered. In the latest CSE calcu-
lations, search, retrieval and interpolation of data from the tabulated
chemistry have become the most computationally expensive tasks in the
CSE routine. Similar to the closure of the PDF, the generation, storage
and efficiency of multi-dimensional chemistry tables are not challenges
unique to CSE/DCSE, but these aspects will require more attention for
future CSE modelling developments.

4.2. Recommendations for a new CSE user

• Chemistry treatment and heat transfer

As described throughout this paper, CSE has some clear potential
to reproduce accurately the complex and coupled effects of turbulence
and chemistry, and as in all turbulent combustion models, there are
challenges that need to be addressed and carefully investigated. For
a researcher new to CSE and interested in trying it out, a few initial
recommendations may be given. First, it is much faster to test and run
calculations in RANS, an initial CSE implementation in a RANS CFD
code is best, knowing that the CSE routine is the same in RANS and
LES. In terms of the ‘‘barebones’’ formulation, it seems appropriate to
start with single conditioning using a progress variable for premixed
combustion or mixture fraction for non-premixed cases, choose Bern-
stein polynomials (simpler implementation compared to regularization)
or zeroth-order Tikhonov regularization for the integral inversion—
the choice will also depend on the researcher’s background—and in-
clude well-known presumed PDF with a well-established chemistry
tabulation. There is a learning curve, but, with this initial model
implementation, the new user will be able to simulate well-documented
experimental test cases and understand how CSE operates. For future
development, first-order Tikhonovov seems to be most promising, but
has not been tested as much as zeroth-order Tikhonov or Bernstein
polynomials. The number of integral inversions depends on the di-
mensions of the chemistry tabulations; typically two chemical progress
variables and if needed, one for temperature or enthalpy, seem to be
sufficient in most cases.

4.3. Future directions

In light of these key CSE elements, future directions may be iden-
tified to move the CSE framework up to the next levels of tackling more
complex turbulent combustion cases including ignition/extinction,
multi-combustion regimes, complex fuels and large radiation effects
found in industrial applications and fire events.

• Computational efficiency

Past CSE calculations have largely relied on manual and static defi-
nition of the ensembles. Future CSE development should include the
implementation of adaptive CSE ensemble assignment, similar to al-
gorithms used for adaptive CFD meshes. This would be a major step
forward towards industrial applications including more complex ge-
ometries. Regularization implementations using zeroth- or first-order
Tikhonov methods have worked well with significant computational
cost reduction in comparison to the early CSE studies. Further tests
are needed for larger matrices that are found in DCSE. The extension
of Bernstein polynomials to double conditioning appears much more
challenging and Tikhonov regularization appears more tractable when
multiple conditioning variables are considered. Overall, it would also
be useful to assess the performance further on large parallel CPU/GPU
systems.

• PDF modelling and DCSE

Perhaps the most key issue is the closure of the PDF, in particular
the joint PDF. Future research should examine the presumed joint PDF
models and their effect on the predictions which will benefit the CSE
model to a great extent. Solving a transport equation for the PDF similar
to the transported PDF model is also possible, however, this approach
likely comes with substantially higher computational costs and extra
modelling challenges for the mixing terms. Successful implementation
of the DCSE model is, therefore, dependent on developing predictive
models for the sub-grid scale mixing to be able to correctly predict
the scalar variance and model the joint PDF of Z and c or other
variables. At this point in time, given the current challenges of double
and even triple conditioning, if enthalpy is added for example, it is hard
to envisage higher levels of conditioning with a complete joint PDF
without assuming a Dirac Delta function and it is not clear that this
would be needed.

More advanced tabulation techniques should be explored in the context
of CSE such as neural network methods. Direct chemistry integration
without the need for tabulated chemistry also needs to be examined in
further detail. With more and more combustion applications using hy-
drogen as a single fuel or as a component in a fuel mixture, the effect of
differential diffusion cannot be ignored and must be incorporated in the
CSE formulation. Some preliminary calculations have been performed
including soot and radiation. Much more needs to be examined for soot
chemistry, inclusion of soot variables in conditional space coupled with
more sophisticated radiation models. This is critical for further CSE
applications, in particular in fire modelling. Until now, CSE has only
considered optically thin radiation models.

This list is far from being exhaustive. The extension of CSE to lean
premixed or partially premixed gas turbine combustors is promising.
The complex geometries in such applications and complex physical phe-
nomena such as flame-wall interaction and thermo-acoustic instability
pose real challenges for the CSE model. Likewise, more research is
needed on the inclusion of spray models with DCSE for turbulent spray
flames that are often in the partially-premixed combustion regime. CSE
can be expected to evolve as new advances are made and new issues
arise.
