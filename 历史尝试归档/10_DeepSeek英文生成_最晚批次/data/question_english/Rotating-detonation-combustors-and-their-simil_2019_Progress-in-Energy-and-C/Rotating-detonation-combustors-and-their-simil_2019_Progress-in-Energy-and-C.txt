Rotating detonation combustors (RDC) are at the forefront of pressure gain combustion (PGC) research,
utilizing one or more azimuthally spinning detonation waves, an intrinsically unsteady process, to effect
a stagnation pressure rise across the device. The prospective step-increase in efficiency, simplicity of de-
sign without the requirement for mechanical actuations and the ease of assembly make it an especially
promising technology that could be integrated into existing propulsion and power generation architec-
tures. This is coupled with the significant complexity of the detonation-based multi-axis flow field and
the associated combustion modes and coupling mechanisms. The current paper is an overview of the re-
search done worldwide to address some of the challenges and questions pertaining to the physics of RDC
operation. When appropriate, notable parallels are drawn to the phenomena of low and high frequency
instabilities in solid and liquid rockets that have been recognized as the most severe hindrance to their
operation.

1. Introduction

The  supersonic  combustion  phenomenon  of  detonation  pro-
duces  a pressure ratio increase of  13–55 in gases  [1] across  the
wave due to the shock wave linked to the combustion front. While
pulsed detonation combustors (PDCs) were the widely investigated
type of pressure gain combustion (PGC) systems, the majority of
recent  research  has  migrated  to  rotating  detonation  combustors
(RDCs). Please consult the comprehensive review of Roy et al. for
a  broad  description  of  the  various  facets  of  gaseous  detonation
physics  and  PDCs  [2] .  The  higher  power  density  [3] ,  the  lack  of
a need to regulate periodic ignition and fuel/oxidizer injection, as
opposed to a PDC, and the steadier exit flow profile [4] circum-
vents the notable issues besetting PDCs. This is due to the very
nature of RDCs, which constitutes one or more rotating detonation
waves (in an ideal operation) spinning about the circumference of
a combustor (with or without channels) in the kilohertz regime, as
long as the reactants are fed into the device after the initial igni-
tion. An image of a transparent RDC in operation is presented in
Fig. 1 a. Fig. 1 b gives the averaged rotating detonation wave struc-
ture obtained from OH radical chemiluminescence, when viewed
from the combustor side.

Despite the considerable progress made to date on the differ-
ent facets of RDCs, substantial research is still warranted to ascer-
tain the physics, and apply RDCs as a real-world, power-generation
device. Until the last few years, the probable efficiency increases
afforded by RDCs, due to detonative burning [5] , remained a fig-
ment of numerical or analytical solutions, with studies claiming: a
notable increased in total impulse over pulsed detonation combus-
tors [4] , a decrease of 9% in fuel consumption compared to tradi-
tional gas-turbine engines [6] , an increase of up to 15% in the total
pressure in the combustor due to detonation [7] , an increase of 5%
in  thermal efficiency  (with an RDC  in a  gas-turbine setting)  [8] ,
an increase in thermal efficiency of 4.6% (with just the combus-

tor) [9] , and finally up to 14% increase in power plant efficiency
over conventional J class turbines [10] . Recently, a handful of ex-
perimental investigations have supported the theoretical promul-
gations of increased efficiency of the detonation cycle. For instance,
in their rocket engine configuration, while duly noting the issue of
unoptimized combustors, the Frolov et al. have shown that RDCs
do indeed have a higher efficiency — by 7–13% — than correspond-
ing deflagrative combustors [11] . Wolanski has estimated a reduced
SFC — by 5% — when RDCs were integrated into their unoptimized
GTD-350 helicopter engine [12] . In the USA, the Air Force Research
Laboratory’s investigation into an open looped, turbine-integrated
RDC resulted in an increased turbine factor — defined as the com-
parison of the total fuel energy input to the system to the energy
extracted by the turbines — with RDCs, as opposed to deflagrative
combustors [13] . Members of the same team [14] , along with Pax-
son [15] , has shown that there is indeed a stagnation pressure rise
across an RDC. These advancements provide hopeful results con-
cerning the efficacy of RDCs to provide the required step-change
increase in gas-turbine efficiency.

In  the  following  sections,  a  panoptic  review  of  RDCs  is  pre-
sented. Since there have been other reviews on the same in the
recent past [3,16–19] , for brevity, the emphasis here is placed more
on issues that have not been dealt with thoroughly. Wolanski’s re-
view contains broad discussions on various combustors that uti-
lize detonative combustion in general, and RDC behavior in partic-
ular [3] . A broad review of numerical simulations is also provided.
The review by Lu and Braun contains in-depth discussions about
analytical  models  in  describing  RDC  performance  [18] .  The  sur-
vey by Schwer and Kailasanath on the progress (and some short-
comings) of simulations in modeling detonation dynamics for pres-
sure gain combustion (PGC) is thorough, recent, self-sufficient and
provides the necessary background on the state-of-the-art meth-
ods and procedures [19] . Kailasanath has also authored two other
reviews on RDCs, with the first providing a detailed history of RDC

development as an engine [16] , and the second one detailing the
country-wise research impetus placed on RDCs [17] . Hence, in the
current review, significant thrust is directed towards experimental
findings and concomitant theories on fundamental mechanics. Nu-
merical simulations and analytical models are discussed whenever
pertinent to the broader discussion of RDC physics. Special stress is
placed on drawing parallels to rocket engine combustion instabil-
ities, when appropriate. The decades-wide issue of the latter pro-
duces a wide gamut of unsteady phenomena — low frequency in-
stabilities (LFI and high frequency instabilities (HFI) — that closely
align with observations attained from RDC mechanics. As will be
argued later with evidence, the observed kinship between both ap-
pears to be driven by the same processes.

1.1. The origins of rotating detonation waves

To appreciate the origins of rotating detonation waves, it needs
to be viewed through the lens of fundamental gaseous detonation
wave physics — a field that has been studied intensively since its
inception in 1883, when two French engineers discovered the phe-
nomenon of detonations in coal mines [21] . Detonation was widely
regarded  as  a  one-dimensional  combustion  wave,  even  after  al-
most  half  a  century  after  its  discovery,  as  the  Chapman-Jouguet
(C-J)  theory  of  modified  Rankine-Hugoniot  equations  with  “zero
reaction width thickness” was able to accurately predict the peak
pressures and wave speeds of the phenomenon. This perception,
however,  was  shattered  in  1926  when  Campbell  and  Woodhead
[22] reported the entirely three-dimensional phenomenon of spin-
ning detonations (SD), which move helically in a tube with station-
ary mixture [23] . Since then, and due to intense research over the
next several decades, several discoveries were made, the most im-
portant of which is the true nature of detonations — the complex
three-dimensional interaction between Mach wave, incident wave,
transverse wave and the reaction zone that together form what is
now  called  the  ‘detonation  cell’  [21] .  Thus,  spinning  detonations
were responsible for the new outlook  on detonation waves, and
naturally have been researched extensively, in spite of which there
are still outstanding issues and questions to be answered. One such
researcher that investigated the complex phenomenon was Voit-
sekovskii [24] . Since a comprehensive analysis of spinning detona-
tions required detonation tubes of considerable length, depending
on the mixture used (even up to 10 m [24] ), Voitsekhovskii’s pro-
posed “fixing” the detonation wave in a stationary frame of refer-
ence, which could potentially alleviate the demanding facility re-
quirements. He reasoned that when a premixed mixture of the re-
quired reactants is fed into an annular chamber at the required in-
let velocity (so as to balance the spinning detonations’ axial veloc-
ity in a stationary premixed tube), the resulting transverse waves,
composing the detonation wave, could be fixed in the laboratory
frame, thereby lending it to be studied more easily. However, since
such a premixed injection was prone to intense flash back events,
he resorted to experimentally testing the next best configuration
— a non-premixed injection that is continually fed into an annular
chamber; or, in other words, what we now know to be a rotat-
ing detonation combustor. Voitsekhovskii’s intention seems to not
have been to create a pressure gain device, but rather to efficiently
study spinning detonations. Over the next several decades, RDCs
have been recognized as a device with very high potential, but the
origins of its inception and its strong links to spinning detonations
have apparently been overlooked for the most part, as pointed out
in Ref. [25] .

The  fundamental  difference  between  the  two  is  that  a  rotat-
ing detonation is axially fixed at a given point in space whereas a
spinning detonation moves helically in an enclosed structure, and
therefore has an axial velocity component [22] . Spinning detona-
tions have a leading shock front (incident wave) that is coupled to

the transverse wave [26] . The secondary difference is that it trav-
els in premixed stationary reactants [21] , whereas rotating deto-
nations move through non-stationary reactants [3] . A comprehen-
sive explanation of spinning detonations is provided in Lee’s mono-
graph [21] and will not be dealt with here. An image acquired from
axially-compensated photography [24] of four laps of spinning det-
onations is given in Fig. 2 a. Fig. 2 b shows four laps of rotating det-
onations, once again acquired from open-shutter photography [27] .
Immediately, the commonality in the structures is evident. Highest
heat  release  (deciphered  by  the  brightness)  occurs  at  the  trans-
verse  detonation  wave  (TDW),  attached  to  a  Mach  stem  (in  the
case of spinning detonations) [21] or an oblique shock wave (in
rotating detonations) [28] . A simplified schematic of spinning det-
onation and its different elements is presented in Fig. 2 a. The ax-
ial direction of motion of the leading detonation front is marked,
along with the locus of the triple point (helical grooves marked
on the tube wall in gray) inscribed by the transverse wave (red
tab). Note that the axially moving detonation front only marginally
coincides with the cross-sectional plane of the tube (i.e., the deto-
nation front has an inherent angular inclination to it - see Fig. 2 a),
whereas the other regions of the front (composed of the incident
wave and Mach stem circumferentially on the wall, and a Mach
leg extending radially inwards towards the tube axis) are warped
downstream  in  conjunction  with  the  TDW.  It  can  be  seen  that
the incident wave pre-compresses and causes some contact surface
burning of the mixture upstream of the TDW. The intersection of
the three waves (triple point) is thought to produce the fine heli-
cal striations seen on soot foil records in detonation tubes during
spinning detonations [21] . One of the most interesting and impor-
tant characteristics of spinning detonations is that the ratio of the
pitch of this helix traced by the transverse wave composing a spin
and the diameter of the enclosure is, for the most part, indepen-
dent of the mixture used [21] . That is, the pitch-to-diameter ratio
( p/d ) of spinning detonations is notionally constant across a rather
extensive spectrum of conditions, and is usually about 3 [26] . A
simple schematic of rotating detonations (composed of the TDW
and the attached oblique shock wave) in an annular space, with
channel width w
ch , in given in Fig. 2 b. Here, the detonation wave
is fixed  in the  laboratory frame at  a  given axial location,  unlike
spinning detonations, while the reactants are injected at a velocity
fill . Thus, a single complete lap of rotating detonation
denoted by v
entails that there be a column of fresh mixture of height, h , be-
fore the start of the second lap, which is called the fill height in
RDC literature [27] . Anand and Gutmark claim that this fill height
is to a rotating detonation what the pitch is to a spinning deto-
nation. That is, if one were to “untangle” the rotating detonation
wave spatially, in the axial direction, by taking into account the
velocity of injected reactants it would result in a helical construct,
the pitch of which is dependent on v
fill , and is equal in magnitude
to the fill height, h . Hence, for rotating detonations, the term anal-
ogous to p/d would be h/d . It is imperative to note here that p/d is
to be construed as the ratio of the pitch to hydraulic diameter ( d H )
and not the geometric diameter. This effect of hydraulic dimension
on spinning detonations in geometries other than a circular cross-
sectional tube was established by analyzing the process in rectan-
gular cross-sectional tubes [29] and annular tubes [30] . For annular
cross-sections (RDCs), the term analogous to the diameter length is
equal to twice the annular width [30] , and hence d H = 2w
ch . Us-
ing a comprehensive literature review of the two detonation phe-
nomena, it was shown that while the pitch-to-hydraulic diameter
ratio of spinning detonations is known to range from 2 to 6 across
a wide range of conditions, the fill height-to-hydraulic diameter of
rotating detonations also extends across a similar range — between
1 and 5 across diverse facilities and conditions [25] . Due to this
similarity between both, the authors deliberated on the possibility
that rotating detonations might be type of near-limit detonation

propagation behavior, like spinning detonations, which Lee [21] as-
certains is “the nature’s last resort for maintaining the detonation
mode of combustion for most mixtures.”

Twelve properties peculiar to the two processes are identified
in Ref. [25] , and the tabulation comparing both has been repro-
duced in Table 1 , with original references. There is a noteworthy
similarity in the observed characteristics of the processes (proper-
ties: 2–6, 8 and 9), with regard to the higher modes of onset and
sustenance,  and  the  velocity  deficits.  This  qualitative  confluence
of different traits furthers the notion that the underlying physics
might be common to both rotating and spinning detonations. Of
the  listed  traits,  the  last  (perturbation  of  shock  front  by  down-
stream combustion) is the most important. If a detonation wave
travels at C-J speed, then by definition, the products expand at a
sonic  speed  relative  to  the  upstream  shock  front  [21] .  However,
considerable velocity deficit is observed in TDWs in spinning deto-
nations. Consensus regarding this is that spinning detonations are
not C-J detonations and the continual propagation of TDW is due
to the strong coupling of the shock wave with the products down-
stream  which  is  only  possible if  the  products  are  subsonic  with
respect to the shock wave. Such a condition normally only occurs
in an overdriven detonation wave, which is not steadily propagat-
ing  and  fails  after  a  finite  time  [21] ,  unlike  a  spinning  detona-
tion.  Lee  attributes  this  “paradox” [21]  to  strong  boundary  layer
effects and two-dimensionality of TDW, which is not captured in
the ideal C-J theory. In light of this finding — of rotating detona-
tion wave’s quantitative and qualitative similarity to spinning det-
onations — it is essential to consider the possibility that rotating
detonations might be a type of near limit propagation of detona-
tion waves. Note that, in gaseous detonations near limit is defined
not only by chemical limits imposed by equivalence ratio, but also
by physical limits that are dependent on the boundary conditions
[21] . It needs to be punctuated here that some of these overlap
between spinning detonation characteristics and rotating detona-
tions (or “detonation-like waves”) have been recognized before by
Voitsekhovskii  and  his  colleagues  back  in  1968  [31] .  They  noted
that the different properties between spinning detonations and the
tangential high frequency instability (to be discussed in the next
section) in rocket engines “show them to be in many respects sim-
ilar”. The difference, Ar’kov et al. argued, is that in spinning det-
onations the reactants upstream of the TDW are pre-compressed
by the main detonation front composed of a strong shock wave,

whereas in the “spinning detonation-like” waves they observed in
rocket engines, there is no such pre-compression. However, they
claim that the only requirement for the propagation of the trans-
verse  front  in  both  cases  — spinning  detonations  and  high  fre-
quency tangential instability — is that it be fed continuously by
chemical reactions downstream of it; or in their words: “the condi-
tions created in proximity of nozzles of a LRE (liquid rocket engine)
are the same as those behind the forward front of a spinning deto-
nation”. Apparently, it is this publication by the team that included
Voitsekhovskii that deliberated, probably for the first time, the idea
of an RDC as we now know it: “The most effective means (of com-
bating HFI) would apparently be the use of transverse waves for
(improving the) burning of fuel. It could ensure a more complete
combustion in chambers of reduced dimensions, since the shock
waves produce further atomization of (fuel) droplets and reduce
ignition arrests”. In the subsequent years following the findings of
Voitsekhovksii, considerable efforts were spent in trying to design
rocket engines with rotating detonation waves, due to the prospec-
tive efficiency increase, as witnessed by the initial pioneering (in
the USA) work of Nicholls et al. [32] – who also recognized the
similarity  with  tangential  HFI  – and  the  later  research  done  by
Adamson and Olsson [33] , and Shen and Adamson [34] on perfor-
mance analysis of rocket engines-based RDCs. In the next section
we will dwell on this mostly forgotten kinship between detona-
tions and HFI.

1.2. The high frequency combustion instability perspective

Broadly,  detonations  can  be  stable  or  unstable  [21] .  Unsta-
ble detonations exhibit a highly time-dependent three-dimensional
behavior  and  manifest  as  different  peculiar  phenomena,  such  as
spinning detonations discussed above. While their actual onset and
exact physics are actively studied, there is common consensus that
unstable detonations have a decoupled shock wave-reaction zone
structure that is brought about due to the quality of reactants (high
activation  energy),  boundary  conditions,  or  both  [21] .  However,
based on the mechanism of a coupled propagation, detonations ex-
ist in one of three sub-types: strong detonation, C-J detonation and
weak detonation [21,52] . A strong detonation has a subsonic flow
of products behind the detonation front, relative to it. As such, a
strong detonation (“piston supported”) cannot sustain indefinitely,
since the detonation wave weakens due to the expansion waves

Symmetricity (property of multiplicity

It has been noted that when there are two waves, the

of waves/heads)

distance between them is lesser than half the
circumferential distance of the RDC [51] . Hence, the
multi-wave modes are not symmetric.

Two heads are unsymmetrical when there is no axial
insert (when the tube is circular), i.e. one head is
stronger than the other. Two heads are symmetric
when there is an axial insert with diameter that is
20% - 50% the tube diameter [24] .

upstream fresh reactants before it is consumed by
the TDW [24] .

There is widespread contention that spinning

detonation is sustained due to acoustic perturbations
from the downstream products interacting with the
upstream detonation front [21] . The frequency and
pitch angle of spinning detonations can be rather
accurately explained using acoustic theory, by
considering pressure antinodes to exist in the
product gases behind the detonation fronts [24] . For
high frequency spins away from the operational
limits, acoustic theory breaks down in describing the
frequency. When the cell size is small compared to
the tube diameter / annulus width, the sustenance
seems not to be due to the acoustic eigen-mode but
due to chemistry [21] . This “paradox” of the
downstream products interacting with the upstream
shockwave suggests that these detonations do not
behave like C-J detonations, despite travelling
steadily (in laboratory frame).

interacting  with  the  reaction  zone.  C-J  detonations  (“unsup-
ported”),  on  the  other  hand,  can  be  freely  propagating  (steady
state), and most mixtures subscribe to the solutions obtained from
the  simple  Rankine-Hugoniot  relation  with  an  additional  energy
release term. Here, the combusted products are sonic with respect
to the detonation front, which means the detonation wave can be
continually sustained, provided the upstream and boundary condi-
tions are held constant. The third detonation type — weak detona-
tion — is theoretically possible [52] , but requires special conditions
to exist. In fact, despite both Zel’dovich and Neumann showing the
theoretical  possibility  of  steady-state  weak  detonations  [21] ,  no-
table apprehensiveness seemed to exist for some time among ex-
perimentalists regarding its possibility in the physical world. Weak
detonations have a shock wave that is supersonic relative to the
expanding products, and as a result have a comparatively (to C-
J) higher propagation velocity and lower peak detonation pressure
[21,52] . It is at this juncture that we seek to divert the attention to
the work of Adams [53] , who tried to experimentally show that
weak  detonation  waves  can  exist  in  gaseous  mixtures,  by  vary-
ing the boundary conditions of the detonation tube. His work was
partly motivated by the results of Voitsekhovskii, who was the first

to show the possibility of having sustained and stably propagating
rotating detonation waves in an annulus [54] . He observed deto-
nation waves moving at half the C-J velocities of the mixture that
was used. While the final results of Adam’s investigation into weak
detonations were ultimately inconclusive, the questions raised by
him regarding the peculiarities observed by Voitsekhovskii in his
rotating detonation combustor are of heightened significance, both
from a fundamental physical inquiry and from an engineering per-
spective.

Multiple researchers [31,55–58] studying rocket engines (both
liquid  propellant  engines  and  solid  motors)  have  observed
“detonation-like” waves  spinning  around  the  rocket  combustion
chamber at thousands of Hertz. This high-frequency tangential in-
stability  in  rocket  engines  has  been  a  source  of  constant  adver-
sity  to  the  development  of  rocket  engine  programs,  mainly  due
to the lack of understanding of the fundamental behavior of the
complex combination of combustion and fluid dynamics. This had
traditionally lead to the highly demanding and economically detri-
mental process of trying to treat the rocket-specific symptoms of
the  high-frequency  instability  by  adopting  a  trial-and-error  pro-
cess of altering the rocket geometry and mixing scheme, among

other things, rather than addressing the nuclei of the issue [59] .
For instance, the F-1 engines for the Saturn V program had to be
subject to over 20 0 0 full-scale test runs to detect and avoid the
intrinsic (starts only after injection of reactants and subsequent ig-
nition) instabilities, as it appeared to be highly sensitive to the in-
jection scheme and flow rates used [60] . Of note is Ariane 5 rocket,
which experienced significant high-frequency tangential instability
events in its Viking engines [61] . The high-frequency instabilities
in rocket engines have been attributed to a variety of factors, some
making more sense than others depending on the research facil-
ity [59] . A combustion-acoustic coupling in the form of an acoustic
wave, conforming to the Rayleigh heat addition criterion [62–64] ,
velocity fluctuations, entropy waves, detonation-like waves, liquid
stream shattering and supercritical droplets explosion are some of
the proposed theories [59] . It is to be emphasized that significant
contention still exists among the researchers of rocket engine in-
stabilities on the fundamental nature of the high-frequency tan-
gential instability. Most studies still prescribe to the Rayleigh heat
addition process through in-phase pressure and heat addition and
explain the “steep-fronted, detonation-like” waves to be a kind of
acoustic wave. However, some other studies [31,55,65] have rightly
pointed out the debilitating shortcomings, both logical and obser-
vational, of this theory. Flandro et al., who are responsible for one
of the most accurate analytical models on these high-frequency in-
stabilities [65–68] , go as far as to say that the theories that are
purely based on the acoustic wave point of view have spent “much
time  and  energy  on  attempts  to  correct  deficiencies  in  the  lin-
ear model by introduction of ad hoc fixes that are often based on
guesswork, and misinterpretation and/or distortion of experimen-
tal evidence”. Flandro et al. note that linear models that only take
into account acoustic effects to describe HFIs in rocket engines are
incorrect owing to the glossing over of the fact that shock waves
are widely observed in rocket engines during unstable operation
[67] . Therefore, the physical mechanisms responsible for these in-
stabilities have not yet been pinpointed, and as a result two main
unanswered questions remain: (i) what is the mechanism causing
these shock-type fronts? [69] , and (ii) why is the injector region
always prone to the strongest erosion that is distinctly segregated
from the rest of the combustor erosion rate if the mode of propa-
gation is acoustic , which would imply a linearity in the instability
strength, combustor-length-wise? [65] . The primary reason behind
not  considering  detonation  physics  to  explain  HFI  in  rocket  en-
gines seems to be attributed to the rather large mismatch between
the ideal C-J model-predicted wave speeds and peak pressures and
the measured values, when such an effort was undertaken [58,70] .
However, this mismatch can now be explained by recent findings
in  the  field  of  RDCs,  where  the  rotating  detonation  wave  speed
and peak pressure across all the facilities worldwide always exhibit
varying levels of deficiencies from the expected ideal C-J values in
an RDC [39,51,54,71–73] . In this regard, rotating detonations dif-
fer from weak detonations since they actually exhibit lower wave
speeds from C-J, which is in contrast to the higher wave speeds
that  should  be  sustained  if  they  were  weak  detonations.  Lower
peak pressures and wave speeds suggest that rotating detonations
are a type of near-limit detonation phenomena, and probably not
weak detonations as questioned by Adams. The preceding section
on the similarities between spinning detonations (near-limit phe-
nomenon) and rotating detonations offer additional support to this
claim.

On the other hand, the rationale behind attributing the Rayleigh
heat addition criterion to explain HFI processes in rocket engines
is  because  there  are  indeed,  oftentimes,  clearly  linear  processes
that tend to operate at very similar frequencies [58,74–76] . This is
seen in symmetric sinusoidal pressure oscillations at high frequen-
cies [77–81] . The problem arises when the same process is also
used to explain the patently non-linear, non-isentropic detonation-

like processes that are also categorized under the umbrella of high
frequency instabilities [65,82] . The origins of this confusion could
perhaps be exemplified in the pressure and ionization traces from
a hollow RDC studied in Ref. [83] . Shown in Fig. 3 are pressure
and ionization traces obtained from the same azimuth of continu-
ous hot-fire operating point. This setup has the ability to track the
relative changes between pressure and ionization since both sen-
sors are at the same azimuth. Note that data acquisition is simul-
taneous and hence the data — pressure (blue) and ionization (red)
— are time-synced, and since they are at the same station, they
give the pressure and ionization behavior of the detonation wave
as it passes through that point in the circumference. Upon ignition
( t ≈ 0 s), it is seen from Fig. 3 a, that initially there is no pressure ac-
tivity; just ionization activity. At t ≈ 0.02 s, rotating pressure waves
with considerable peak pressure magnitudes (and hence rotating
detonations) appear. However, at t ≈ 0.05 s, the rotating detonation
wave  seemingly  descends  into  highly  unstable  propagations  that
are characterized by “packets” of subsequent laps that have ampli-
tude modulated (AM) sinusoidal component. This unstable behav-
ior extends till t ≈ 0.28 s, after which there is, once again, sustained
periodic rotating detonations without the packets of instability. Of
interest is the fact that, for a given packet of instability, ionization
(red) is recorded for only about roughly the first half of the sinu-
soidal packet, whereas the second half is composed of just pres-
sure activity ( Fig. 3 a). Fig. 3 b shows pressure and ionization data
from an arbitrary duration from the same test point when there
is stable rotating detonation wave propagation. It can be seen that
the shock wave precedes the ionization (combustion) peak, as is
to be expected in a detonation wave. A further magnified image of
this snippet ( Fig. 3 c) shows this distinction — pressure peak pre-
ceding the ionization peak — better. The black circles denote the
peak pressure and ionization values, and are acquired by a time-of-
flight algorithm that captures peak values, for a given lap. Fig. 3 d
contains pressure and ionization data during two subsequent pack-
ets of unstable operation, from the same test case. As explained
earlier, for a given amplitude modulated packet of subsequent ro-
tating pressure waves, ionization activity exists for roughly the first
half of the packets. Periods between the two packets do not exhibit
any ionization, but do exhibit very weak rotating pressure waves
that do not exceed 0.5 bar — this is indicative of an acoustic wave
and not a detonation wave generally. A striking difference from the
pressure-ionization coupling behavior seen during stable operation
( Fig. 3 c) is evident in Fig. 3 e during unstable behavior. During un-
stable propagation, most laps in a given cycle have the peak pres-
sure succeeding the ionization/combustion peak. While this result
is seemingly contradictory at first glance this is postulated [83] to
be due to the flame acceleration and transition to detonation phe-
nomenon, most commonly observed in ducts with deflagration-to-
detonation inducing obstacles [84] . In their comprehensive review
of  the  said  phenomenon,  Ciccarelli  and  Dorofeev  [84]  state  that
“flame propagation in an enclosure generates acoustic waves that,
after  reflections  from  walls  and  obstacles,  can  interact  with  the
flame front and develop flame perturbations through a variety of
instability mechanisms” and say that if such a flame propagation
is fast enough, it “can result in severe flame distortion which can
induce flame acceleration and, in extreme cases, cause transition
to detonation” [84] . It was postulated that the concave surface of
the RDC outer wall acts like a reflecting obstacle thereby sustaining
the propagation process. It is a well-known property of detonations
in curved channels to have pronounced collision and subsequently
stronger ignitions at the outer concave wall [85,86] . Even in the
absence of an actual detonation wave, fast deflagrations are known
to accelerate much faster near concave surfaces, such as U-bends in
tubes [87] . The alternate coupling and decoupling of the pressure
and ionization front seen here is also widely noted in detonation
propagation  in  tubes,  where  they  are  called  galloping  and  stut-

tering  detonations  [21] .  Indeed,  very  similar  steepening  of  wave
profiles  from  an  initial  wave  that  appears  to  be  acoustic  in  na-
ture, to a final form that is highly discontinuous has also been ob-
served in rocket engines (see Fig. 4 a reproduced from Blomshield
[88] ). The usually non-linear nature of HFIs is clearly visible in the

oscillogram-acquired  pressure  traces  in  a  rocket  engine  chamber
( Fig. 4 b). The propensity of highest erosion to occur close to the
injector headwall (and not distributed through the chamber, if one
assumes an acoustic mode) is seen by the image of an F-1 engine
after an HFI event ( Fig. 4 c). Clearly, from the above information it

can be ascertained that there seem to be two scientific fields —
detonation physics and combustion instabilities — operating rather
independently of each other, trying to solve variations of what ap-
pears to be the same problem. The next section is a review of the
findings related to the structure and propagation characteristics of
rotating detonation waves that apparently answers the speed and
pressure deficits, and the inclination to produce the highest heat
transfer near the injector elements.

2. Rotating detonation structure and dynamics

Before proceeding further it is essential to realize that a rotating
detonation wave is composed of multiple structures, namely the
transverse detonation wave, attached oblique shock, and slip line,
among other fluid dynamic phenomena. This is akin to spinning
detonations which also include multiple parts: transverse detona-
tion wave, primary shock front, Mach leg, etc., as explained in the
previous section. A schematic of an annular RDC with an aerospike
nozzle is presented in Fig. 5 a. The specifics of different nozzles and
other RDC geometries like hollow and disk will be dealt with later
in the review. For understanding the most important particulars of
the rotating detonation wave structure, annular configuration of-
fers  the  best  possibility.  The  schematic  shown  in  Fig.  5 a  can  be

unwrapped in a two-dimensional plane as shown in Fig. 5 b. Due
to the high injection velocity required to stabilize the rotating det-
onation wave (D) at a given location axially near the injector, the
wave is always tilted towards the headwall as seen in the figure (a
rotating detonation can be formed, at least in theory, for injection
velocities ranging between a non-zero value to the ideal C-J value
[90] ; beyond this it becomes a standing oblique detonation). The
process is better visualized when in a detonation-fixed frame of
reference schematized by Nordeen et al. [91] . Shown in Fig. 6 a is a
detonation wave which is moving with a tangential velocity, U wave ,
when  supplied  by  an  injector  with  flow  velocity,  V.  In  this  sce-
nario, the true wave speed is the one that results in the closure of
the velocity triangle composed of U wave and V. That is, the actual
rotating detonation wave speed is higher than the experimentally
measured (mostly from a time-of-flight algorithm or frequency es-
timates) speeds. Despite Nordeen et al. noting this issue, most ex-
perimental investigations on RDCs resort to assuming the tangen-
tial wave speed as the actual wave speed. While such an assump-
tion induces only a small error at low injection velocities, it causes
considerable error at higher flow rates. For instance, if V is 500 m/s
(most  RDC  injectors  are  considerably  choked  to  reduce  the  cou-
pling between the supplies and combustor) and U wave is 1500 m/s,
D is actually 1580 m/s — a 5% error in estimated velocity. As can be

seen in the figure, in a detonation-fixed frame, the reactants enter
the detonation at an angle, get consumed by the wave and exit as a
burnt products, also at an angle. Refocusing our attention back on
Fig. 5 b, it is seen that a triangular wedge shaped region is formed
upstream of the wave, composed of fresh reactants for the wave
to consume. This shape in caused due to the nature of expansion
of the products downstream of a rotating detonation wave, which
has both an axial and lateral component, due to the initial mo-
mentum supplied by the injected reactants upstream of it. The net
result of this is that there is considerable pressure-difference in-
duced swirl (pressure downstream of the detonation front is higher
than that upstream of it) throughout the combustor, as denoted
by the laboratory-frame product velocity, u p . Owing to this multi-
dimensional expansion of the burnt products, which occurs at the
high pressure region behind the detonation wave, the associated
backpressure imparted by this process on the injectors cause them
to completely cease supplying flow momentarily. The subsequent
relaxing of the injector is linked to the gradient in pressure in the
products region (shown by orange for more intense pressures, and
yellow for the less intense region). This pressure gradient is what
causes the wedge shaped refill region of the upstream fresh reac-
tants. Note that the nature of the swirl produced by RDCs is a re-
gion of notable debate. There is a net swirl in the flow-field exiting
the combustor, when it exits into atmospheric conditions [19,40] .
However, addition of a convergent-divergent nozzle which chokes
the exit flow, or pressurizing the combustor by other means, re-
sults in producing strong reflected shock waves from the exit plane
that moves in a direction opposite to the rotating detonation wave
[40,92] , actively working on negating the swirl caused by the lat-
ter. This process was seen by Nordeen et al. [40] , by analyzing the
direction and magnitude of the velocity of multiple streamlines in
an RDC with three different exit conditions. Other effects of noz-
zle addition will be discussed in later sections. The refill process is
quantified in RDC literature by the maximum height of the region,
and is called fill height. The importance of fill height in dictating
not just stable one-wave mode, but also higher number of rotat-
ing  detonation  waves  was  discovered  by  Bykovskii  et  al.  [27] .  If
the fresh mixture upstream exceeds a critical fill height, then more
than one detonation wave is spawned and exists in the annulus si-
multaneously. This process of rotating detonation wave multiplicity
is reviewed later in the paper.

In  the  section  above,  attention  was  directed  to  the  mecha-
nism responsible for large deviations of waves in rocket engines
and RDCs from C-J conditions. To explain this, one must first un-
derstand the velocity deficit mechanisms observed in fundamen-
tal studies on detonation propagations in tubes. As first explained
by  Lee  and  his  associates  [21,94,95] ,  velocity  deficits  (from  the
C-J speed) at near-limits are due to two fundamentally different
mechanisms. Using argon-diluted and argon-undiluted mixtures in

a porous-walled tube, they established that there are two types of
near-limit detonation wave behavior: stable and unstable. In sta-
ble detonation wave propagation (argon diluted), despite there be-
ing  a  velocity  deficit,  the  detonation  wave  travels  with  a  rather
steady velocity over time and distance. In this case, the velocity
deficit is due to the area divergence effects im parted by boundary
layer effects. In the shock wave-fixed reference frame, there is a
negative boundary layer displacement where the density is lower
than that in the free-stream products and the velocity higher. This
causes a divergence in the streamtube area, which induces two-
dimensionality  to  the  detonation  wave  structure.  This  “area  di-
vergence” effect  was first noted by  Fay,  who used it  to explain
the observed velocity deficits in planar detonations [96] . Since the
streamlines diverge due to negative boundary layer thickness, the
products expand with subsonic velocities through the virtual di-
verging nozzle, thereby establishing a strong coupling between the
downstream products and the upstream shock wave. This idea was
expanded further by Dabora et al. [97] to account for the veloc-
ity deficits in detonations propagating with a lateral relief (inert
compressible mixture on one side and flammable reactants on the
other for detonation to sustain). The second mechanism responsi-
ble for velocity deficits at near limits (argon undiluted) is due to
inherently unstable cellular detonation caused by severely limiting
geometric constraints. In this case, detonation propagation is not
steady and consistent failing and re-ignition of detonation waves
is observed, which brings along with it considerable variations in
detonation cell width and length. This effect is produced when the
detonation cell size becomes comparable to the size of the geo-
metric cross-section, thereby heightening the effect of TDW inter-
action with boundary layer losses [21] . It is important to note that
the above two velocity deficit types not only vary in their driv-
ing physics, but also in their characteristic dimensions and mag-
nitude of deficits. Velocity deficits caused by area divergence (of
which lateral relief is a subset of) exhibit only low deficits from C-
J, not falling below 20% of the ideal speed. Higher deficits of more
than 20% are caused by the unstable detonation propagation [21] .
Area divergence is dependent on the parameter of the finite reac-
tion width based on the Zel’dovich – von Neumann – Döring (ZND)
model. Lee explains that shock plane and the C-J plane are sepa-
rated by the reaction zone width [97] , which can be approximated
to be the cell length, L c , for stable detonations (chemistry depen-
dent) [21] . For unstable detonations exhibiting large deficits, cell
length is no longer the defining factor, owing to the high insta-
bility of the propagation front which ignites and fails. Here, the
characteristic dimension is the cell width, λ, i.e. it is geometry de-
pendent.

Some evidence for lateral relief causing velocity deficits in RDCs
is  shown  by  Paxson  in  his  numerical  simulations  [98] .  Contours
of  temperature  in  an  RDC  flow-field  shown  in  Fig.  6 b  represent

191

the “turbulence induced reaction zone enlargement” effect of lat-
eral relief accompanying rotating detonations. This enlargement re-
sulted in reduced chemical reaction rate, and thus lower speeds
and temperature. Deficits of 15% −40% were reported in the numer-
ical study of Paxson, which tends to mimic the observed deficit
magnitudes seen experimentally [98] . Paxson also notes that this
effect  is  peculiar  to  RDCs  and  is  not  seen  in  pulsed  detonation
combustors. Uneven mixing due to non-premixed reactants injec-
tion, heat transfer to the combustor wall and wall friction also con-
tribute to the velocity and pressure deficits in rotating detonations,
as shown by the simulations of Paxson and Co-authors [15,91,99–
103] . This is not surprising since the same factors are also known
to cause deficits in planar gaseous detonations [104] . An endeavor
trying to simulate an analogue to this unwrapped RDC structure
(detonation wave moving in a linear channel with an unbounded
edge), without reactants injected laterally to the RDC, measure a
deficit of not more than 20% [105] . This adds further emphasis to
the notion that the peculiarity of wave speed deficits in RDCs is
linked to the presence of a moving flow-field upstream of the det-
onation wave. Since Paxson attributes this effect to his observed
deficits, one has to question why there is still a 20% deficit even
when there is no lateral mixture injection. This could perhaps be
answered by the simulations of Houim and Fievisohn, who found
that detonations moving through a layer of combustible and in-
ert mixtures tend to propagate stably dependent on critical con-
ditions pertinent to the acoustic impedance and shock structures
formed  at  the  inert  boundary  interface  [106] .  Strong  cellular  in-
stabilities, akin to the unstable deficit mechanism discussed above,
were observed due to formation of Mach lens structure at the in-
teraction points. They argue that if one were to assume completely
burnt products after a rotating detonation wave, it is reasonable
to assume that the wave sees an inert boundary on one side and
combustible  mixtures  in  the  wedge-shaped  profile  on  the  other
side  close  to  the  injector  wall  (see  Fig.  5 b).  Thus,  results  from
diverse  simulations  and  experiments  suggest  that  rotating  deto-
nations are amenable to both types of velocity deficits observed
in  basic  detonation  propagation  mechanics  — stable,  predicated
on chemistry, and unstable, dictated by physical bounds. In other
words, it is possible to explain the discrepancy of the character-
istics of detonation-like waves (with C-J estimates) in combustors
based on “non-ideal detonation” physics [21] .

The remaining two prominent structures that need to be ad-
dressed are the oblique shock wave attached to the TDW, and the
slip line. The oblique shock is produced due to the differential den-
sity between the inert layer (which is the burnt products of the
prior detonation lap in RDCs) and the supersonically moving TDW
[28] . A slip line is seen in RDC flow-field originating at the inter-
section of the TDW and oblique shock, since they are discontinu-
ities that separate regions of different velocities, which are at pres-
sure equilibrium [107] . Due to pockets of unburnt reactants, there
is also significant burning here, and is sometimes called contact
surface  burning  to  indicate  the  different  densities  and  tempera-
tures behind the TDW and oblique shock [108] . At this juncture,
the  exact  nature  of  this  discontinuity  is  still  under  scrutiny  and
hence researchers have resorted to also using slip lines or contact
surface to explain this discontinuity [108,109] . Hishida et al. dis-
covered  significant  vortex-roll  ups  in  the  in  the  wedge  of  fresh
mixture  upstream  and  speculated  it  to  be  produced  due  to  the
Kelvin-Helmholtz  instability  (velocity  difference  across  the  inter-
face) [110] . Li et al. studied this interface between the products and
fresh reactants further and confirmed that the interface is in actu-
ality a second contact surface in the RDC flow field, owing to the
difference in density and temperature on the two sides of it [111] .
Additionally, they also obtained canonical structures that suggest
strong Rayleigh-Taylor instability (density difference across the in-
terface)  to  be  present  here,  in  addition  to  the  previous  instabil-

ity ( Fig. 7 a). Considerable baroclinic torque was also discovered in
this interface implying the possibility of high shear strength which
might cause instabilities downstream. The same team, in another
publication authored by Liu et al. [112] furthered this investigation
by analyzing the slip region formed downstream of the intersec-
tion of the detonation wave and oblique shock. Interestingly, while
the effects of baroclinic torque along the slip line were found to
be negligible, two strongly unstable modes of vorticity were ob-
served, with each exhibiting a spin in a direction opposing each
other ( Fig. 7 b). This was attributed to originate from the transition
shock (the protruding notch marked by red arrow in Fig. 5 a be-
tween the TDW and oblique shock) that connects the detonation
wave with the oblique shock. Numerical simulations have indeed
observed this transition shock in rotating detonation waves before
[113] , but did not address it in much detail. The protrusion into
the flow-field upstream of the detonation wave was posited to be
caused due to the higher velocity of this wave owing to its pas-
sage through hot gas (higher sound speed). Uemura et al., however,
proposed that the transverse detonation wave is formed due to ex-
plosions occurring at this transition shock region when it passed
over the unreacted gas pockets at the interface between fresh re-
actants and products [114] . This newly formed wave was shown to
move towards the injector elements and bounces off the surface
and causes a subsequent explosion event at the transition shock
point. Though Houim and Fievisohn did not simulate rotating det-
onations, they suggest the presence of both Kelvin-Helmholtz and
Richtmyer-Meshkov  instability  (caused  by  impulsive  acceleration
of fluids with different densities) in the contact surface/slip line
in  their  inert  gas-bounded  detonation  motion  in  linear  channels
[106] . Additionally, Davidenko et al. [115] observe two groups of
expansion waves originating from the top and bottom point of the
TDW. This is marked in Fig. 7 c. These waves are used to explain
flow turning in the vicinity of the detonation wave. In this regard,
there appears to be a disagreement between the actual points of
origins of these groups of expansion waves. Zhdan et al. [116] in
their numerical simulations and Bykovskii et al. [117] in their in-
terpretation of high speed images propose two groups of expan-
sion fans, but both originating from within the base of the RDC,
i.e. near the headwall where the detonation wave interacts with
the  fresh  reactants.  As  shown  by  the  derivation  of  the  rotating
detonation wave structure by Fievisohn and Yu [109] based on a
first principles-based, method of characteristics approach, Prandtl-
Meyer expansion fans would originate from the top and bottom
of the TDW, as seen by Davidenko et al. [115] . This is a modifi-
cation  from  the  observed  structure  in  an  unbounded  detonation
moving through an inert mixture on one side and stationary re-
actants on the other. Since at C-J plane, the Mach number is unity
and after it, the products expand supersonically, Prandtl-Meyer ex-
pansion fans are to be expected right after the C-J plane at the
interface due to flow turning [97,118] , as shown by Dabora’s sem-
inal work on this issue [97] , where he used a shock-tube analogy
to systematically derive the resulting angle of the interface contact
surface burning, which in turn causes an oblique attached shock.
It is to be noted that Zheng et al. [119] claim, from simulations
and subsequent computations of the Gibbs free energy, that the at-
tached oblique shock wave is responsible for high inefficiencies in
an RDC flow-field because of unnecessary entropy production from
the shock. A lower RDC length is recommended to overcome this
issue of decreased Gibbs free energy of the system.

The exact nature of the axial flow velocity at the RDC exit ap-
pears to be a point of contention. Since there have been no ex-
perimental studies specifically investigating that, simulations have
been  used  to  predict  flow  conditions  downstream.  Zhdan  et  al.
[116,120,121] and Bykovskii et al. [27] infer that there is a “nor-
mal Mach line” midline of the RDC at which “transonic transition”
occurs. This line was posited to wrap onto itself thereby creating

a purely supersonic axial flow at the RDC exit. This, however, ap-
pears  to  be  an  artifact  of  the  methods  used,  since  both  Schwer
and Kailasanath [122] , and Dubrovksii et al. [123] show the drastic
variations in the two-dimensional unwrapped assumption of an ac-
tual RDC flow-field, by comparing it to a three-dimensional, more
realistic, model. In three-dimensional simulations which take into
account the annulus width dictated by the presence of the inner
and outer wall, significant recirculation zones were found near the
inner wall of an annular RDC where the detonation fails periodi-
cally. This effect of detonation enhancement on the outer wall and
failure  near  the  inner  wall  is  a  well-known  occurrence  in  deto-
nation  propagation  in  curved  channels  — the  outer  wall  acts  as
a compression surface and strengthens the wave while the inner
wall acts as a decompression surface and causes detonation cell
enlargement (weakening) [85,86,124] . This was found to cause ex-
tensive regions of subsonic axial flow at the RDC exit, which would
not be attainable in two-dimensional simulations. An example of
this three-dimensionality of an RDC flow field is given in Fig. 8 a,

from the work of Schwer and Kailasanath [125] . One should note
that  the  important  element  here  is  the  three-dimensionality  in-
duced curvature , since a three-dimensional simulation of a linear
RDC analogue with continuous injection of mixture also showed a
completely supersonic exhaust [122] . Hence, the assumption of an
“unwrapped” RDC flow-field being the same as the original three-
dimensional one should be brought into question [126] . Under the
conditions of the propagation along a curvature with a finite width,
the normal (perpendicular) detonation velocity-curvature relation-
ship, commonly known as the D n - κ rule [124,127] , seems to have
a significant impact on RDC behavior. The effect of adding an ex-
haust plenum to the simulations [122] to generate real-world ef-
fects was also found to cause a notable change by removing two-
dimensional artifacts of reflected shocks from the exit end of RDC
as seen in Fig. 8 b. The phenomena described above are non-trivial
to investigate on their own. When occurring in conjunction with
each  other  in  a  high-frequency,  high-temperature  detonative  en-
vironment  with  swirling  flows  and  strong  system  level  coupling

(discussed later), the process of analyzing RDC flow fields becomes
a monumental task. The fast progress in computational fluid dy-
namic  algorithms  [128]  and  rapid  increase  in  computing  power
[129] might help decipher internal RDC dynamics in the coming
years.

3. Geometries

3.1. Annular

In  this  section,  effort s  pert aining to  the  most  tested  configu-
ration of an annular cylinder are discussed. As such, the driving
geometric variables are the annulus width, the overall combustor
diameter and the length of the RDC. Each will be discussed sepa-
rately. Zhou and Wang [130] , numerically, tested the effect of all of
these parameters to reveal the differing behaviors. Maintaining a
constant diameter of the inner wall, while increasing the channel
width was found to produce a curvature on the detonation front
and additional reflected shocks from the outer wall, as shown in
Fig. 9 . For the largest channel width, the detonation front is very
weak at the inner wall due to decompression caused by the convex
surface, which results in the production of expansion waves. The
outer wall produces a stronger detonation region near it since it
compresses the wave. Note that the outer portion of the wave also
travels at a faster linear tangential velocity than the inner portion
(it is a product of a constant angular velocity and radius). These
effects result in considerably smaller cell sizes near the outer wall
and enlarged cells by the inner wall, as seen in the experimental
and numerical soot foil records obtained by Pan et al. [86] in a pre-
mixed, non-moving reactants setup ( Fig. 10 a). A schematic of a det-
onation wave in a stable propagating mode as it traverses a curved
channel is illustrated in Fig. 10 b from the work of Nakayama et al.
[85] .  In  the  RDC,  increasing  the  diameter,  while  having  a  con-
stant channel width, produces shock trains that get progressively
stronger and extend further downstream of the detonation wave.
This was attributed to the reflection of shock waves, not only from
the outer wall, but also from the inner wall, a process implied to
be caused due to the product gases not fully exiting the chambers
with larger diameter. A similar effect was also observed when the
diameter and width were fixed, but the length was varied. Longer
RDC lengths tended to causes stronger shock trains through the an-

nulus, with a corresponding increase in the strength of the Mach
wave  reflecting  from  the  inner  wall.  Interesting,  here,  the  shock
train got shorter, despite getting stronger, as opposed to the cases
with increased diameter. These effects were explained to be the
effect of product gas expansion — lack of complete exit from the
annulus causes significant secondary and tertiary shock structures.
This amplifies the discussion made in the last section that three-
dimensionality is integral to the RDC flow-field. Support for these
reflected  shock  waves  is  present  in  the  pressure  traces  of  Kin-
dracki et al. [54] , whose experimentally acquired pressure traces
show secondary peaks adjacent to the main detonation peak pres-
sures at lower annulus widths. This double-peak behavior is also
seen by Zhang et al. [131] in their experimental investigation of
different annulus widths. It should be noted that having reflected
shock waves emanating from the annulus walls do not hinder RDC
stability.  In  fact,  the  results  of  Kindracki  et  al.  suggest  the  con-
trary.  Larger  diameter  and  larger  annulus  widths,  overall,  aid  in
having  highly  stable  RDC  operation  defined  by  repeatable  peak
pressure and detonation lap speeds. This appears to be an effect
of geometry-confined, near-limit cellular instability (discussed be-
fore) occurring in the detonation waves when the channel width is
small, and is comparable to the detonation cell width, i.e. bound-
ary  layers  losses  occur  at  lower  widths.  Additionally,  increasing
the diameter has the effect of producing higher plenum recovery
after every passage of the wave, since the detonation wave now
has to travel a longer circumferential distance, which would entail
enough time for the injector elements to recover and allow proper
propellant flow. These effects are inferable from the data of Kin-
dracki et al. [132] presented in Fig. 11 . Results from Driscoll et al.
[133] also indicate higher stability at increased channel widths, and
widespread unstable RDC operation at smaller widths. However, as
pointed out by Bykovskii et al. [27,134] , it is important to bear in
mind the effects of changing a channel width at a given flow rate.
Higher width tends to lower the overall mass flux through the an-
nulus, which in turn translates to lower fill height of the fresh mix-
ture upstream of the wave. Under these low fill height conditions,
once again the combustor is prone to unstable operation. A similar
facet holds true for RDC diameter as well, with lower fill heights
being produced at larger diameter. Hence, it is apparent that there
are multiple tradeoffs pertaining to the annulus width and diam-
eter. This could be attributed to the largest RDCs tested so far in
laboratories not exceeding 20" in diameter [51,57,73,135] . Attaining

stable detonation wave propagation depends on all of the above-
mentioned factors.

3.2. Hollow

The parameters dictating annular RDC physics also holds true
for hollow RDCs. However, here, there are additional parameters
owing  to  the  removal  of  the  inner  wall.  In  such  a  scenario  the
“unwrapped” RDC analogue does not hold owing to the very pro-
nounced  three-dimensionality  of  the  wave  [37,136] .  In  a  hollow
RDC, curvature of the rotating detonation front, radially, is unavoid-
able as seen in Fig. 12 a from Tang et al. [137] . The outermost part
of the wave propagates at about twice the speed of the lower tail
end of the wave. As explained earlier, this is due to the compress-
ibility provided by the concave wall. From the simulations of Tang
et al. and Songbai et al. [44,138] , it can be seen that there is a fi-
nite radial depth to the detonation wave structure, after which the
“tail” terminates ( Fig. 12 a and c). Currently, it is unclear if this is
an effect of the injection schemes used in the simulations (fresh
mixture is not injected at the center of the combustor), or if it’s
the natural tendency of a detonation wave to always terminate at
the center. This causes considerable burning by deflagration at the
RDC axis ( Fig. 12 a and b), where the burnt products are imparted

considerable swirl before they exit the chamber. Moreover, it was
noted that the fresh mixture is dispersed more evenly in the hol-
low RDC, as opposed to the annular one. Songbai et al. show this
effect by comparing the fill height of the fresh mixture upstream of
the detonation wave for both cases, and showed that hollow RDC is
prone to producing a more even fill height, radially. This was pro-
posed to be a negative effect, as the strongest part of the detona-
tion front is by the outerwall, which would mean that the annular
RDC would produce a more efficient burning of the reactants since
the fill height is highest near the wall. Owing to the two reasons
discussed in the section above (inefficient non-detonative burning
and  product  entrapment  in  the  combustor),  hollow  RDCs  might
be prone to an inherent loss in efficiency. On the other hand, be-
cause of the removal of the channel width-dependent dimensional
constraint, it would be possible to attain detonations in mixtures,
which  were  otherwise  non-detonable.  Evidence  for  this  is  seen
in ethylene-air powered annular RDCs of Wilhite et al. [139] and
Andrus  et  al.  [140] .  Both  non-premixed  (former)  and  premixed
(latter) injection only resulted in barely isobaric sound speeds of
the rotating detonation wave, for a wide range of flow rates and
equivalence ratios. The presence of continuous sharp, discontinu-
ous pressure waveforms traveling at isobaric speeds suggests the
propagation mode could be quasi-detonations, per Lee [21] . Since

quasi-detonations  can  travel  even  at  30%  of  the  C-J  speed,  they
have velocity overlaps with fast deflagrations, which makes their
mechanism hard to understand [21] . It should be noted that these
detonations are mostly seen in rough-walled tubes, suggesting ge-
ometric limitations or factors causing their occurrence. Hence, less
reactive  mixtures  in  annular  RDC  appear  to  be  affected  by  the
channel width. However, a different study [83] utilizing the same
RDC outer diameter (6”) showed wave speeds upwards of 95% of
the C-J speeds (assuming a global equivalence ratio) at select op-
erating points in their hollow combustor in ethylene-air mixtures.
Peak pressures of this wave were considerably high and even ex-
ceeded 20 bar for certain laps. It seems likely that this is an effect
of removing the boundary-based losses associated with detonation
propagation in an annulus, similar to the same effect seen in pla-
nar detonations through tubes which become progressively weaker
at smaller characteristic dimensions [21] . Perhaps, hollow RDCs are
one of the solutions that could tackle the widely measured velocity
deficits seen in annular RDCs [39,51,54,71–73] . It is yet to be quan-
tified if this increased strength of detonations is worth the tradeoff
of having vast regions of deflagrative burning. One method to over-
come this is to provide an air stream through the center of the de-
vice. Stoddard et al. have shown both numerically and experimen-
tally that rotating detonations can be sustained in a “flow-through”
hollow  RDC,  where  injection  is  done  transverse  to  the  combus-
tor, which in turn does not have a headwall [141–144] . A specially
shaped lip at the upstream end of the RDC helps entrain significant
air flow from the atmosphere into the combustor. Simulations and
experiments show that, in such a scenario, there is very minimal
burning at the RDC center, which could lower the inefficiencies of
hollow RDC designs. Any region in the RDC head plane not covered
by injection holes (as is the current scenario with all hollow RDC
studies done so far) should be expected to produce vast regions
of recirculation causing deflagrative burning – a design flaw that
needs to be rectified in future iterations.

At  this  juncture,  it  is  essential  to  reconsider  the  discussions
from Section 1.2 regarding high frequency instabilities in rocket en-
gines. As argued earlier, if one were to only observe the essence
of  the  instabilities  — very  fast  moving,  shock-fronted,  steep,  ro-
tating waves capable of producing high heat transfer close to the
injectors, in hollow combustors — there should not be objective
difference between a hollow RDC and a rocket engine experienc-
ing HFI. Fig. 13 a shows high-speed aft-end images from a hollow
RDC [35] that shows a detonation wave (the foremost part clearly
visible  and  marked  with  a  red  dot)  propagating  clockwise  after
the initial blast wave deposition from the pre-detonator (red ar-
row).  There  is  a  brief  period  of  apparently  non-luminescent  ac-

tivity (but considerable pressure activity at low magnitudes) that
separates  the  ignition  event  from  the  onset  of  a  stable  rotating
detonation wave, suggesting a complex DDT event [35,145] . Also
shown ( Fig. 13 b) is the high speed images obtained from the exit
of a rocket engine with tangential HFI (clockwise rotation), from
the experiments of Clayton et al. [70] . One could see the qualita-
tive congruence of the combustion activity of the two devices —
characterized by a sectorally-distributed combustion wave stronger
(more luminescent) at the wall, and less so at the center — with
the  rotating  detonation  wave  temperature  profile  from  the  sim-
ulations  of  Tang  et  al.  (see  Fig.  12 a).  Additionally,  this  “rotating
detonation-like wave” captured by Clayton et al. [70] in a series
of experiments performed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (con-
sult  the  references  section  of  the  cited  paper)  shows  that  “the
peak amplitude of the disturbance varies with the location of the
measurement” with “the greatest amplitudes occur near the injec-
tor end of the chamber wall and in the outer half- radius of the
injector  face  (i.e.,  near  the  corner  of  the  chamber)”.  They  mea-
sured  pressure  ratios  of  20:1  near  the  injector,  which  decays  to
4:1  at  the  entrance  of  the  nozzle.  Heat  transfer  was  measured
to exceed rates obtained during normal steady combustion by an
order  of  magnitude  at  the  injector  headwall  section.  Shown  in
Fig.  14 a  are  the  pressure  profiles  obtained  at  various  radial  dis-
tances  in  their  rocket  engine  headwall,  clearly  representing  the
propensity for highest pressure near the concave combustor wall,
and considerably lower pressure towards the rocket engine’s cen-
tral axis. Based on the compilation of the phase and peak pressure
obtained by the different circumf erentially and axially distributed
probes, Clayton et al. presented an “artist’s conception of the ro-
tating detonation-like wave front”. The original image along with
the complete title used for it is given in Fig. 14 b. The striking simi-
larity of the rendering of the wave’s shape to the pressure contour
plot obtained by Songbai et al. [138] in a hollow RDC with a noz-
zle cannot be overlooked (see Fig. 12 c). Flandro et al. [65,67] , using
their novel analytical model using a superposition of twenty acous-
tic modes (to indirectly obtain nonlinearity), were able to match
the  pressure  and  shape  of  the  nonlinear  waves  seen  by  Clayton
et al. The tangential nonlinear wave modeled by them is shown
in  Fig.  14 c,  as  it  moves  in  a  clockwise  direction.  They  also  pro-
posed this high speed spinning wave to be behind the production
of “sloshing” in a rocket engine, which is an occurrence charac-
terized by circumferentially or radially varying reactants flow rate
due to “transverse oscillations” [67] . In RDCs, this is attributed to
the reactants filling height after detonation wave passage. Also of
importance  is  that  Clayton  et  al.  do  not  see  significant  pressure
activity after the choked nozzle from their instrumentation setup.

This  is  also  the  case  in  RDCs  with  a  CD  nozzle  at  the  exit  (see
the  section  on  RDC  boundary  conditions).  Different  names  have
been used over the years in rocket  engine literature to describe
this occurrence, namely tangential instability, resonant combustion,
acoustical  disturbance,  transverse  instability,  spinning  instability,
screaming instability, etc. [58,59,70,146] . However, the observations
across these studies regarding shock-fronted waves, very high peak
pressures and heat transfer rates have remained the same. Clay-
ton  et  al.  deliberate  on  this  conundrum  as  follows:  “Regardless
of whether the phenomenon is called a detonative or an acous-
tical disturbance, it is believed that the definition of the param-
eters controlling it requires understanding of the generating and
sustaining  mechanisms  for  steep-fronted  combustion-supported
pressure  waves  sweeping  about  the  periphery  of  circular  cross-
section  chambers”.  In  subsequent  sections,  discussions  on  RDC
physics will be further supplemented by similarities seen in rocket
engines.

3.3. Disk

The third main variant of RDC designs is a disk-shaped RDC,
or  “disk  RDC” [147] .  Bykovskii  et  al.,  who  pioneered  this  con-
cept [36,148–151] resort towards calling this variant a “plane-radial

combustor”. The physical difference between the two geometries
mentioned in the above sections and the current one is exempli-
fied in Fig. 15 a. In contrast to the more traditional RDC designs, in
a disk RDC the reactants are fed either radially inward (as shown
in the figure) or radially outward (not shown). One or more rotat-
ing detonation waves are formed between the straight-walled con-
fines of the disk-shaped combustor, and the burned products are
expanded through the central axis. Because of the circular shape,
the flow inside experiences continuously changing cross-sectional
area (dependent on the radius from the center) from the inlet to
the outlet when the two chamber walls are parallel to each other.
Hence, to attain a constant cross-sectional area for the flow-field, it
is imperative to increase the channel width continually as the ra-
dius is shortened, as pointed out by Huff et al. [152] . Traditionally,
this issue has been overlooked in most disk RDC studies, which
might cause inadvertent flow choking, due to highly reduced areas
at low radii. This class of devices is proposed to overcome strict
spatial restrictions, and is pitched as an auxiliary power unit (APU)
for aircrafts [152] , as well as a combustor for radial compressors
and turbines [153] . Due to the injection of reactants along a radial
plane,  disk  RDCs  are  especially  amenable  to  easier  visualization
(such as Schlieren) of the wave due to having combustor walls that
are not curved [38] . The problem of detonation wave analysis can

be made even simpler by extracting the essence of this design in a
premixed setting: wave propagation in rectangular cross-sectioned
curved  channels  prefilled  with  reactants  [85,124,154] .  Studies  of
this simplified nature have produced notable results pertaining to
the importance of channel curvature and radius on the sustenance
and stability of the detonation wave. Particularly, it has been es-
tablished that the ratio of inner channel radius to the detonation
cell size needs to be higher than 23 to warrant stable detonation
wave propagation, irrespective of the mixture used. The findings
from Kudo et al. on detonation wave properties in curved channels
[154] was noted to apply reasonably well for rotating detonation
waves  with  continuous  reactants  injection  in  a  disk  RDC  by  Xia
et al. [155] , who performed a wide range of two-dimensional nu-
merical simulations to ascertain the driving parameters controlling
wave propagation in a disk. As expected, both the radius of the
inner wall, r
i , (which in turn controls the strength of the expan-
sion fans emanating from there as noted in a prior section) and
the  pressure  in  the  medium,  p a ,  (which  controls  detonation  dy-
namics) had an effect on stability. They propose a minimum in-
i + 0:464 p a > 80.932 to
ner radius of 40 mm and the relation of r
produce  stable  rotating  detonation  waves  in  a  disk-shaped  RDC.
The  operating  regime  for  such  a  combustor  from  simulations  is
presented in Fig. 15 b. Note that detonation stability, in this sec-
tion, is defined as per the notions used in basic detonation stud-
ies [21] — see the section on rotating detonation wave structure
above.

Experimental studies so far on disk RDCs have noted consider-
ably higher velocity deficits — more so than in an annular RDC —
from the ideal C-J speed, most times never exceeding 80% of the
isobaric sound speed in the medium of propagation [38,152,153] .
Nakagami et al. [38] , in particular, note that they do not observe
shock waves in their RDC, suggesting acoustic propagation pred-
icated  on  the  Rayleigh  criterion  of  in-phase  pressure  and  heat
addition rather than detonation mechanics. The pressure profiles
from Nakagami et al. [38] and McClearn et al. [147] also suggests
the mode of propagation to be more of a quasi-detonation as op-
posed to a proper stable detonation wave (very high peak pres-
sure deficits and relatively more prolonged rise times). This might
be  an  artifact  of  the  fact  that  in  this  type  of  RDC  the  normal
component  of  the  rotating  detonation  wave  (D n ),  which  as  dis-
cussed earlier is the “true” detonation wave velocity and is higher
than  the  tangential  velocity,  is  directly  incident  on  the  reactant
injectors, thereby causing significantly higher plenum disturbance,
which in turn leads to rather inefficient rotating detonation waves.
This could also be an effect of no longer having a solid concave
boundary that produces strong compressibility effects on the det-

onation wave thereby strengthening it, as discussed above. Com-
pounding these issues is the current inability to accurately deter-
mine the exact location of the “head” of the detonation wave. Ow-
ing to the methodology of determining wave speed from frequency
and distance traveled between sensors, and the widely observed
nature of the detonation wave to “lift-off” from the injector ele-
ments at certain conditions, significant error could be introduced
in the estimated velocity due to the geometry of disk RDC (since
linear velocity is a product of radial distance and angular velocity)
[147,152] . Moving forward, it is thus imperative that these ques-
tions be answered before practical application of disk RDCs. Disk
RDCs share other traits seen in annular and hollow RDCs. An ex-
emplary schematic of a wave rotating in a disk RDC with reactants
supplied radially inwards is shown in Fig. 16 a, using data obtained
from Schlieren imaging [38] . As can be seen, there is a finite time
and distance for the fuel and oxidizer plenums to recover after the
wave passage (denoted by θ ), not unlike that seen in other RDC
geometries. The rotating wave induces significant swirl not only in
the products of combustion but also in the injected reactants, as
evidenced by the slant of the individual jet streams. A peculiarity
of this design is brought forth by Levin et al. [156] , who performed
a three-dimensional numerical simulation of a disk RDC running
on propane-air mixtures, utilizing billions of cell elements in the
Lomonosov Supercomputer. They note that the product expansion
in their studied setup had a swirl in the direction opposite to the
direction of the rotating detonation wave (see Fig. 16 b). Addition-
ally, the centerline of this vortical region is asymmetric (does not
fall in the axis of the combustor) and is non-parallel to the axial
line (the z-axis perpendicular to the x-y plane shown in Fig. 16 b).
At this juncture, it is unknown if this is an artifact of the specific
combustor geometry. It is to be noted that the detonation wave
once again has a distinct forward tilt as it passes over the injectors
[157] , as observed in Fig. 16 a. It is, however, unclear if this forward
tilt is maintained when the reactants injection is radially outward,
where no such distinct tilt is visible — see the difference between
radially  inward  vs.  radially  outward  injection  in  Fig.  17 a  and  b.
One could speculate that the effect of expansion waves emanating
from the convex surface (discussed above) might alter the detona-
tion dynamics — this area is not yet studied in this RDC variant.
Nevertheless, the typically observed modes of RDC operation such
as  contra-rotating  waves  [147] ,  counter-rotating  waves  [157]  and
longitudinal pulsed detonation [149] (these modes are discussed
in detail below) are observed in disk RDCs at corresponding rep-
resentative  conditions  similar  to  annular  RDCs,  which  suggests
that  the  driving  mechanisms  in  the  various  RDC  geometries  are
similar.

4. Reactants

A variety of reactants have been tested so far across different
facilities world-wide, the most prominent of which is hydrogen-air
mixtures owing to the ease of detonating this mixture. There have
been  other  gaseous,  liquid  and  solid  particulates  tested  to  pro-
duce rotating detonations. Listed in Table 2 are the mixtures tested
and reported in open literature currently. Note that this list distin-
guishes sustained propagation as success (including unstable prop-
agation) and everything else (momentary presence of a detonation
wave from the pre-detonator, or pure deflagration) as failure in a
given mixture (as reported by the authors); the negative results of
failed detonations are still valuable to understand detonation dy-
namics or the lack thereof. In order to avoid redundancy, not more
than three references are provided for a given mixture. We refrain
from commenting on the speed of the rotating detonation wave/s
since it varies considerably based on the injection flow rates (since
relative wave speed is the actual speed), and also depends strongly
on the mixing inside the combustor. It is recommended to consult
the associated references to understand the case-specific properties
of the dependence of detonation parameters on the reactants.

Before proceeding to the list of reactants tested in RDCs, it is
asserted  that  it  would  an  understatement  to  claim  that  the  re-
search  on  heterogeneous  detonations  – both  liquid-oxidizer  and
solid  particulates-oxidizer  – is  narrow  in  comparison  to  funda-
mental studies on gas-phase detonations [160,161] . While both the
phases do exhibit a lot of the observations made in gaseous det-
onations – such as the alteration of detonability with changes in
pressure and temperature – there are considerable differences that

have been noted so far, and prospectively many more to discover
[161] . Since a comprehensive treatment of the same is beyond the
purview of the present review, we do wish to only provide some
context to the prospective usage of liquids and solids in an RDC
environment. The readers are recommended to further pursue this
topic from the references discussed herein. Heterogeneous detona-
tions mainly differ in that energy is released discretely at the re-
gions at or near liquid droplets [161] or solid particulates [160] ,
which  is  in  contrast  to  the  relatively  continuous  energy  release
seen in gaseous detonations. This entails an added layer of com-
plexity to these detonations that are governed by mass, momen-
tum and energy transfer in addition to chemical non-equilibirum
processes [160] . Naturally, the size of the droplets/ particles them-
selves assume a paramount importance with regards to detonabil-
ity and the associated deficit from the ideal C-J speed for a com-
parable  gas-phase  reaction.  While  liquid  detonations  behave  al-
most like their gaseous counterparts when it is highly vaporized,
this  situation  is  altered  rapidly  as  the  droplet  size  is  increased
due  to  the  energy  lost  due  to  droplet  heating,  vaporization  and
drag effects (bow shocks are formed commonly upstream of the
bluff-body-shaped dropelets [162] ) [161] . Thus, concurrently higher
deficits from the C-J speed is observed as the droplet sizes are in-
creased; the detonation velocity in kerosene-oxygen mixtures go
from 2400 m/s to 1600 m/s as the droplet size is increased from
10 μm  to  about  30 0 0 μm  [163] .  Similar  trends  are  seen  in  det-
onations  through  reactive  solid  particulate-gas  oxidizer  medium,
where an increase in the  particle diameter  of  a chosen  reactant
above a finite size renders the solid as an almost-inert structure
within the main detonation reaction zone (from ZND theory), and

ends up reacting after the sonic plane [160] . Additionally, the im-
pulse loading of a gaseous detonation is altered when combined
with combustible solid particles, which in turn also dictates the
driving physics [160] . For instance, a representative heterogeneous
charge with solid particles provides twice the impulse than a ho-
mogenous charge containing the same amount of explosive in the
near-field [164] . However, in solid-phase detonations, the recorded
cell sizes are an order of magnitude larger than the comparable
sizes in gaseous detonations, implying severe restrictions on the
usage of RDCs as solid propellant rockets [160] . Despite both liquid
and  gaseous  detonations  exhibiting  the  generic  diamond-shaped
structure on soot-foil records (more or less), there appears to be
drastic  changes  in  the  physics  associated  with  burning.  At  cer-
tain  conditions,  both  the  phases  are  prone  to  secondary  shocks
that form from the droplet [161] or the particulate [160] eventu-
ally moving in both direction (towards and away from the leading
shocks). The elusive weak detonations (where the majority of prod-
ucts are supersonic relative to the leading shock) are rather promi-
nent in liquid [165] and solid [160] detonations, as well. Hence, it
can be concluded that the above-mentioned parameters and intri-
cacies of heterogeneous detonations are of heightened importance,
but were not necessarily considered – but should certainly should
be in the future – in the literature surveyed in Table 2 . We forecast
significant effort s being diverted to fundamental studies on hetero-
geneous detonations so as to better-design injection systems, igni-
tion methods and motor-casings to be used in RDCs.

5. Ignition and onset

During the beginnings of what would become a decade of in-
tense  research  on  RDC,  considerable  focus  was  directed  towards
the problem of proper ignition of RDCs [18,73,185,186] . However,
multiple  recent  effort s  have  shown  that  detonation  initiation  in
an RDC is one of the simpler problems to overcome, since mixing
is the dictating factor as discussed in the Section 6 . A very brief
overview of detonation initiation is in order. Broadly speaking, det-
onations can be initiated in one of two ways: (i) direct detonation,
and (ii) deflagration-to-detonation transition (DDT) [21] . The first
method produces a detonation wave in a combustible mixture al-
most instantaneously [187] , with the caveat that it requires igni-
tion  energy  deposition  that  is  usually  about  an  order  of  magni-

tude higher than the DDT process, in a given mixture [21] . For a
propulsive device, direct detonation cannot be depended upon due
to the prohibitive requirements of energy to be carried onboard,
and hence DDT is preferable for RDC ignition. DDT, however, is one
of the most complex physicochemical processes observed widely
in  nature,  in  both  confined  and  unconfined  spaces.  An  excellent
compilation of the apparently disparate events that are dependent
on DDT is given by Oran [128] , aptly titled: Understanding explo-
sions – From catastrophic accidents to creation of the universe . DDT,
in its essence, is a process dependent on small-scale fluid dynamic
and chemical interaction. However, when the right conditions are
met, it can rather dependably produce detonations that manifest
as large-scale events, through a variety of mechanisms. While the
right conditions are a subject of intense scrutiny [2,128] , some of
the processes responsible for DDT are known currently, and range
from hot spots through flame accelerations and synchronized elec-
tric discharges to turbulence generation [21,128,188] . For the pur-
poses of the current review, DDT in mostly gaseous media within
confined  spaces  is  of  interest.  In  this  regard,  flame  acceleration
seems to be the primary mechanism responsible for DDT [84,187] .
Since this process requires a certain run-up length for the defla-
gration wave to accelerate, cause compression waves to form up-
stream of it, which then finally transforms into a detonation wave,
different mixtures require different tube geometries to induce DDT
[84] .  Flame  acceleration  ending  in  a  detonation  event  is  widely
conceded to be caused due to the Zeldovich mechanism (or the
shock wave amplification by coherent energy release — SWACER)
[187,189,190] . This is seen clearly in the pressure-time traces pro-
vided in Fig. 18 a, where the formation of the initial compression
wave from the accelerating flame is seen at about 0.05 m, which
eventually leads to a DDT  event at a  time of about  0.16 m with
a 70 atm pressure peak, finally stabilizing to a stable detonation
wave. The process is visualized experimentally in Fig. 18 b, which
shows the warped flame front, the upstream compression waves,
which in turn produces a detonation event in the last frame after
a finite distance. To overcome this geometric limitation, methods
like turbulence enhancing obstacles [191] , shock wave deposition
[192] , etc. have been used in PDCs to continually produce detona-
tions, reliably [2] .

In RDCs, the widely adopted way to ignite the device is to use
what is called a “pre-detonator”, which is essentially a miniature

PDC that is oriented in a way (either directly into the combustor
[195] , or facing into it from the aft-end [47] ) that would let it de-
posit a blast wave into an RDC. This is similar to the “pulse guns”
used to bomb rocket engines to ascertain if the geometry and re-
actants can be triggered to produce HFI [59] . When the mixture
inside the combustor is amenable to sustain detonations, this blast
wave from the pre-detonator can easily and constantly induce DDT
inside an RDC. Over the years, a variety of techniques other than
pre-detonators have been used to initiate RDCs, each as efficient
as the other. A prior review from Lu and Braun [18] on RDCs has
a comprehensive list of the different procedures used to initiate
RDCs — we recommend reading their publication for information
regarding it. Irrespective of the strategy used, RDC initiation has
to follow the DDT process. This was verified by a study from St.
George et al. [196] dedicated to quantifying the energy deposited
by the pre-detonator blast wave into an RDC annulus. They found
that  the  estimated  energies  are  significantly  lower  than  that  re-
quired to cause direct detonations — by an order of magnitude for
the hydrogen-air mixtures tested. After the instance of the blast
wave injection (or the first instance of a high peak pressure event
inside the previously cold-flow RDC), there is always a visible pe-
riod of chaos. This duration, called the “onset time” [197] , varies
significantly depending on the reporting facility, even for the same
fuel-oxidizer mixtures. An example of RDC ignition and onset pro-
cess  is  seen  in  Fig.  19 a–c,  which  shows  pressure  and  ionization
traces from three sectors in the combustor, along with the pres-

sure dynamics in the air injector. As seen, detonation wave propa-
gation barely completes a lap (cannot be tracked across the three
sectors) from ignition (time of about 0 s) until stable propagation
begins at approximately 0.022 s. From this point onwards there is a
set directionality and speed for the rotating detonation wave (red
- > black - > blue traces till fuel supply lasts). A study by Peng et al.
utilizing a 30 mJ spark found that, for a given operating point, the
onset time lasts between 1 ms and 7 ms [198] . They followed up
this study with another, utilizing three different ignition sources
with vastly different energy depositions, and found that the onset
time remained largely unaffected [199] , which should be unlikely if
the onset times are dependent only on the DDT process, since such
a process lasts merely for a few milliseconds in tubes [200] . While
there is still a large degree of variability in the onset time for the
same case ( ±50%), the higher energy ignition source only yields
a  slightly  lower  average  DDT  time,  differing  by  a  few  millisec-
onds.  Bykovskii  et  al.  [175]  utilized  multiple  initiation  strategies
to achieve detonation of fuel-air mixtures in an RDC, including a
low-power heat pulse, injection of a product jet, and transmission
of a detonation. For the detonation transmission case, none of the
experiments resulted in a direct transition of the initiating wave
into a stable rotating detonation. All cases exhibited a transitional
process of 4–80 ms duration, which was associated with the recov-
ery of uniform air injection for detonation transmission, or the de-
velopment of tangential instability and subsequent DDT when us-
ing the other ignition sources. Another study by St. George et al.

the pressure dynamics in the combustor during onset and stable propagation, and (c) pressure dynamics from the air inlet indicating the strong disturbance induced in it
[20] .

[197] also strongly pointed towards the supply plenums as the pri-
mary reason for the onset times seen in RDCs. They investigated
four different operating points ten times each to attain statistical
rigidity  (since  the  onset  process  is  highly  chaotic).  By  changing
the air flow rates, the equivalence ratios and the backpressure, it
was revealed that despite some variability between tests, the av-
erage onset time between the different cases was clearly distin-
guishable based on the operating conditions. For an air flow rate
of  0.5 kg/s,  the  onset  time  was  in  tens  of  milliseconds,  whereas
0.4 kg/s (at two different equivalence ratios) always tends to pro-
duce onset times that extend to hundreds of milliseconds. When
the system is backpressurized, there is very low variability in on-
set times between the ten tests and stable detonation propagation
always started within 6–7 ms. Fotia et al. [195] have also gathered
some evidence that suggests injector conditions dictate RDC igni-
tion process. It is, thus, apparent that there is a plenum conditions-
related  variable  that  dictates  a  significant  duration  of  the  onset
times reported for RDCs.

Towards this end, Gutmark [20] suggests that the supply plena
sizing and geometry may have an equally important role to play in
the onset behavior of RDCs. They modeled the pressure dynamics
in the combustor and air inlet as a type of feedback loop defined
by  a  single  input  (combustor  dynamics)  and  single  output  (air
plenum dynamics) system [20] . By using a systems-identification
model capable of validating and predicting the output of the sys-
tem (air inlet dynamics), it was found that the settling time of the
air injector impulse response was behind the onset times observed
in pressurized RDC operations. However, in an atmospheric RDC,
the onset time seemed to be linked to intense reverberations oc-
curring  inside  the  fuel  plenum  due  to  shock  wave  leakage  from

the detonation wave. This caused the fuel plenum to come to rest
a considerably longer time after the air plenum. Because of these
reverberations, the fuel plenum acts as a notably higher order sys-
tem and was not able to be modeled like the air inlet (third or-
der). The experimental settling time of the air inlet after the ini-
tial blast wave deposition in cold-flow RDC (no fuel supplied, and
hence no combustion) and the impulse response function obtained
by the modeling approach is given in Fig. 20 a and b, respectively.
It can be seen that the settling times match decently within an
order of magnitude; so does the underdamped nature of the air
injector pressure oscillations after the disturbance from steady air
flow conditions. The pulse guns used in rocket engines are known
to trigger both tangential spinning and standing modes inside the
chamber, irrespective of the angular orientation to the combustor
[59] . A similar scenario was discovered by Miller et al. [186] , who
determined that the rotating detonation wave propagation is not
linked  to  the  direction  of  orientation  of  the  pre-detonator.  Sim-
ilar  to  RDCs,  there  is  also  a  settling  time  linked  to  this  “initial
shock wave’s perturbation of steady-state”, which can be easily as-
certained experimentally by using only cold-flow. This impulse re-
sponse of a rocket engine combustor is observed in Fig. 20 c from
Harrje and Reardon [59] . From this section, it should be clear that:
(i) detonation initiation in an RDC is through a DDT process, and
(ii)  the  onset  times  are  predominantly  caused  due  to  the  injec-
tor and plenum recovery from steady-state conditions of cold-flow.
In  subsequent  sections,  evidence  is  presented  that  shows  injec-
tion and mixing are perhaps the most important feature that dic-
tates RDC operation. Note that the method of ignition should not
cause any drastic changes in the onset times, per Peng et al.’s find-
ings. Since the peak pressure of detonations inside the combustor

is roughly equal to the initial blast wave from the pre-detonator
(see  Fig.  19 b),  this  implies  that  regardless  of  the  method  used,
one should expect a similar magnitude of disturbance when a det-
onation  wave  is  formed  inside  an  RDC.  The  authors’  own  expe-
rience  and  anecdotal  statements  from  other  researchers  support
using  spark  plugs  to  ignite  RDCs,  as  opposed  to  pre-detonators,
since the former is highly reliable, durable and easily replaceable.
The added complexity of pre-detonator ignition is warranted only
when it is not possible to ignite the engine any other way; quartz
walled RDCs need to be ignited by a pre-detonator shooting into
the combustor from the exit since, quartz cannot be machined to
have grooves [47] .

6. Injection and mixing

Injection and mixing are perhaps the most important param-
eters that constitute RDC operation. In fact, as evident from the
discussion in the above sections, the onset and sustenance of det-
onations in an RDC are almost assured if the reactivity and qual-
ity of the mixture is susceptible to DDT- just like in planar det-
onation waves [21,84] . This, of course, is highly non-trivial to ac-
complish owing to two reasons: (i) strong coupling of the injec-
tor elements with the detonation wave, and (ii) the unknowns of
the mixture requirements needed to generate detonation waves in
an annular or hollow RDC. Broadly, both non-premixed and pre-
mixed reactants injection can be used in RDCs. However, the lat-
ter is harder to obtain owing to the very high probability of flash-
back occurring because of the considerable shock leakage and com-
busted products backflow from the detonation wave into the injec-
tor. A study by St. George et al. [174] utilizing a partially premixed
RDC (ethylene and air was premixed, but hydrogen was supplied
separately) showed that higher equivalence ratios tended to pro-
duce severe flashback events that permanently stopped the opera-
tion. In order to avoid this, Andrus et al. [173,201,202] resorted to

using specially-designed premixing and flame-arresting injectors in
their ethylene-air powered RDC, which resulted in the comprehen-
sive  avoidance  of  flashbacks  throughout  the  tested  points.  How-
ever,  usage  of  hydrogen-air  in  the  same  premixed  RDC  resulted
in violent flashback events that curtailed RDC operation to a few
milliseconds. Another study by Li et al. [183] showed the possi-
bility of attaining rotating detonations by premixing pre-vaporized
liquid Jet A-1  with heated air. However, the premixed operation
tended to behave poorly in comparison to the non-premixed op-
eration, showing a continued weakening of the wave (in terms of
peak pressures) as the test progressed. The results above indicate
that premixing of an RDC might not necessarily be an advisable
venture. This is due to the presence of a detonation wave that pro-
duces, locally, both upstream product flow and shock wave leakage
into the supply plenums (see Fig. 21 a and b) which could subse-
quently ignite the reactants when premixed [140] . Bedick et al. in-
vestigated the extent of plenum penetration from “one-shot” deto-
nation events from a pre-detonator to find that very strong shock
waves leak into the air plenum (slotted injection) due to the blast
wave from the pre-detonator (comparable peak pressure to rotat-
ing  detonation  waves).  This  initial  strong  shock  wave  then  pro-
ceeded  to  get  reflected  from  the  multiple  corners  of  the  encas-
ing plenum as well as bounce off as reflected waves from its base.
A similar effect was also observed in the fuel plenum, albeit at a
much lower level, due to the damping / isolation provided by the
small-holed injectors of the fuel plenum, as opposed to the slotted
air injector [203] . Numerical investigations of RDC behavior and its
dependence on injection usually utilize premixed schemes because
of the simplicity in boundary conditions setup [28,92,116,137,204] .
However,  there  is  a  notable  variation  between  idealized  models
with a slotted injection, in comparison to a non-ideal model with
discrete  injection  elements  and  associated  plenums  [205] .  Such
simulations  observe  pronounced  shock  trains  inside  the  supply
plenums  stemming  from  the  incident  wave  leaked  from  the  ro-

tating  detonation  front  [206,207] .  Considerable  overpressure-to-
underpressure  ratio  fluctuation  in  the  reactants  plenum  with  an
increase  in  the  ratio  of  exit  area  to  throat  area  of  the  injector
micro-nozzles  is  observed  [206,207] .  Relative  to  the  detonation
wave, the reflected waves travel opposite to it, inside the plenum,
as  observed  in  Fig.  21 c  [208] .  These  results  indicate  the  impor-
tance  of  pressure  ratios  – alterable  by  changing  the  mass  flow
rate  – across  the  injectors  in  determining  stable  RDC  operation
[14,27,133,134,209–212] .  Choked  injectors  are  susceptible  to  dis-
turbance only momentarily, at a given location in space, whereas
unchoked  injectors are prone to significant alteration of  internal
flow and pressure dynamics [46,209] . On the flip side, it should be
noted that too high a pressure injection ratio would counteract the
performance gain offered by detonative combustion, thereby mak-
ing the overall process inefficient, as pointed out by Paxson [15] .
Very high ratios cause a pressure loss across the system, whereas
lower ratios produce an increase in entropy (total pressure loss)
due to the backflow into the injectors and subsequent reorienta-
tion of the streamlines towards the RDC exit [15] . Besides this, the
actual spacing and shape between the injectors is also of a high
consequence. Generally, a dense injector spacing tends to promote
uniform mixing, thereby avoiding random auto-ignitions that can
spawn a new detonation wave in an altered direction (more on this
under Section 8 ) [47,207,213] .

Uniformity of mixing needs to be enforced, not only in the cir-
cumferential direction, but also in the radial direction, as seen by
the  results  of  Liu  et  al.  [204]  who  showed  that  the  fresh  mix-
ture  is  predisposed  to  significant  deflagrative  burning  (wasteful)
along the radius, when the injection schemes were altered along
this axis. Depending on the injector shape (cylindrical, convergent
nozzle, divergent nozzle, pintel, cavity slot, diode slot, etc.), there
could also be trackable changes pertaining to the wave propagation
[206,207] . Strong reflected shocks are produced as the detonation
wave interacts with the individual injector elements [207,208] . Also
of importance is the fact that slanting orientations of the injector
appear to predicate the nature of the flow after the choked nozzles,
i.e. overexpanded jets are not observed when the tilt of the cylin-
drical slots are 40 ° to the RDC headwall, irrespective of the relative
direction of the detonation wave [207] . Researchers have also pro-
posed having angled wedges on the injector headwall and differen-
tial injection velocities to promote a stable and single directional-
ity of the wave — to the detonation wave, a backward facing step
would produce divergence and cause failure — but this needs to
be tested experimentally [144,214] . Thrust vectoring has also been
demonstrated, numerically [215] and experimentally [216] , in RDCs
by altering the local stagnation pressure of the injection plenums,
sectorally. Despite all this progress, there is yet to be broad guide-
lines dedicated to RDC injector designing, as none of the parame-

ters tested to date offer a significant reduction in plenum distur-
bance.

The above discussion pertains purely to premixed RDCs. In actu-
ality, almost all RDCs successfully tested so far are non-premixed.
This produces more layers of complexity — the relative temporal
and spatial recovery of the different plenums after interaction with
the detonation wave [133,220–222] , and the required mixing be-
tween oxidizer and fuel [19,83,205,223] . An “unwrapped” RDC ex-
perimental study by Fotia et al. [224] visualized the fuel plenum
dynamics and concluded that detonation wave passage inflicted a
time delay of 200 μs before the plenum could recover to its nom-
inal fuel supply state (this would be higher for air plenum due to
the larger injection area). The pressure wave inside this plenum
was found to travel at about 60% of the detonation wave’s speed
in  the  combustor,  which  led  the  authors  to  postulate  a  possible
“pressure beating” phenomenon in the air and fuel plenum due to
the relative difference in the two waves’ speeds (the leaked shock
wave  from  the  second  lap  of  the  detonation  wave  will  interact
with the one from the first lap causing interference by superpo-
sition). These effects can cause strong secondary coupling effects
as well (discussed in the Sections 7 and 8 ). Depending on the flu-
idic damping provided by the injector sizes and the pressure ra-
tio across it, different supply plenums exhibit varied responses to
the forcing impulse function (detonation event) [225,226] . Driscoll
et al. [133] , followed by Deng et al. [222] , showed, using basic gas
dynamic equations and experimentally measured pressure values,
that this uneven plenum recovery can be approximated by a func-
tion called blockage ratio, which essentially is the percentage of
the injection area of the fuel/oxidizer that is completely occluded

and cannot supply gases through it due to detonation wave pas-
sage. Driscoll et al. correlated the values of this function for air and
fuel plenum separately and found that unstable operation (chaotic
propagation; discussed in Section 8.1 ) of RDCs is prevalent when
there is a mismatch between the two. This relative recovery pro-
duces a process called “stratification” where the mixture in the re-
gion  of  the  detonation  wave could  either be  highly  lean  or  rich
depending on which plenum starts proving gas supply again [47] .
As a result, the local equivalence ratio tends to be drastically dif-
ferent  from  the  global  equivalence  ratio.  The  same  mismatch  is
possible even if the recovery times are equal. One could postulate
that non-uniform mixing contributes considerably to the observed
velocity  deficits  from  the  C-J  speed.  Driscoll  et  al.  [227]  identi-
fied the widely used slotted air-fuel injection holes mixing scheme
to  be  a  type  of  jets  in  a  cross  flow  (JICF)  issue.  By  varying  di-
verse injection parameters, it was shown that strong recirculation
zones and counter-rotating vortex pairs (CVPs) are prevalent in the
RDC flow-field ( Fig. 22 a), even during cold-flow conditions, mak-
ing the assumption of minimal changes in local equivalence ratios
invalid. Bluemner et al. [228] and Rankin et al. [229] have iden-
tified this large recirculating zone experimentally. Since most RDC
testing so far has resorted to using choked flow for both fuel and
oxidizer, the jets-based issue at hand is compounded, since super-
sonic JICF produces a wide array of fluid dynamic structures, such
as strong bow shocks, shock barrels, separation bubbles that oscil-
late at a low frequency [230–233] . Though it might be tempting to
avoid these processes by using rocket engine-type injectors where
both oxidizer and fuel are supplied through meticulously arranged
holes  [234] ,  it  should  be  noted  that  such  a  setup  would  cause

tangible  pressure  losses  across  the  air  injectors,  which  as  was
discussed  earlier  counterproductive  to  increasing  RDC  efficiency.
So  far,  Bykovskii  et  al.  [235] ,  experimentally,  and  Gaillard  et  al.
[122,236] , numerically, appear to be the only research groups to
analyze RDC operation with impinging injectors. The importance of
using non-premixed simulations in describing RDC injectors is seen
in Fig. 22 b from Fujii et al. [219] . They imitated a non-premixed in-
jection scheme in a two-dimensional simulation to show that vast
regions of deflagrative burning exist in the RDC. When the spac-
ing between the injection holes is increased, for the non-premixed
scheme, the rotating detonation wave structure deviates tremen-
dously from the ideal, as seen in Fig. 22 b. They quantified the ef-
fect of the detonation wave passing through vast regions of burned
gas to cause a deficit of 16% from the ideal C-J value for the mix-
tures  used.  However,  from  the  discussions  above,  it  is  apparent
that  there  are  many  other  factors  that  contribute  to  this  deficit
in addition to improper burning. While a three-dimensional reac-
tive flow simulation of an RDC with separate plenums is time- and
computation-intensive, it is able to qualitatively and quantitatively
predict the detonation wave shapes recorded experimentally [47] ,
as shown by Cocks et al. [205] , and is warranted for the problem
at hand.

Edwards [57] was the first to propose pre-burned mixtures to
be behind the pressure and velocity deficits seen in rotating det-
onation waves, and specifically used this inefficient burning pro-
cess to try to link tangential HFI in rocket engines to RDC physics,
in his annular 20" combustor running on ethylene and enriched
air. In this regard, it is crucial to ask a very important question:
if  rotating  detonation  waves  can  be  produced  in  both  a  hollow
and  an  annular  combustor,  what  is  the  physical  mechanism  re-
sponsible  for  its  production  and  continued  sustenance?  That  is,
under what conditions does an ordinary combustor become a ro-
tating detonation combustor and vice versa, and is it something
that can be controlled? In fact, if rotating detonation waves can
be produced in a hollow combustor that are of equal strength (in
terms of pressure and velocity) to the waves produced in an an-
nular combustor, it would be logical to resort to this design, con-
sidering the heightened heat transfer to the annular walls [137] .
Since it is well known that a planar detonation in a tube with the
same mixture concentration gets progressively weaker, and eventu-
ally fails when the tube diameter is reduced below a critical value
of detonation cell size [21] , logic dictates that we move away from
the annular designs that have been the singular signature of ro-
tating detonation combustors until now. Towards the resolution of
this question, Ref. [83] showed that mixing is the primary variable
that  dictates  the  functioning  of  a  hollow  combustor  as  an  RDC.
They demonstrated that a hollow combustor exhibiting transverse
(radial) acoustic oscillations (high frequency) with peak pressures
ranging  below  2 bar,  can  be  “converted” into  an  RDC  capable  of
sustaining strong rotating detonation waves with speeds of more
than 95% of the C-J velocity and peak pressures sometimes exceed-
ing  20 bar,  by  merely  integrating  a  3 mm  thick  circular  plate  on
the RDC headwall to divert the incoming flow towards the com-
bustor’s outerwall (every other parameter was held constant). The
hollow RDC geometry with the flow-turning obstacle is depicted
in Fig. 23 a, along with contours of variation in ethylene mass frac-
tion with radius, from a notional two-dimensional simulation. It
was concluded that having fresh reactants by the concave wall of
the combustor and proper injection velocities (so as to not cause
decoupling  of  the  wave,  or  produce  a  lift-off)  were  required  to
produce and sustain rotating detonations. Incidentally, in an un-
related work from 1960s rocket engine researchers appear to have
asked a similar question [59,237,238] , differing only in semantics:
how  does  injection  layout  affect  the  performance  of  the  engine,
stability-wise? Multiple injector configurations were parametrically
tested, with the resulting velocity profiles shown in Fig. 23 b. Their

problem was characterized as one of “energy release per unit area”.
Of the six profiles depicted in Fig. 23 b (predicated on the energy
and velocity input into the three concentric regions of the combus-
tor, A, B and C), profiles II and V produced stable smooth deflagra-
tive combustion. Profile IV showed radial HFI with peak pressures
of 13 psi, which was attributed to all the energy deposited in cir-
cle B, where a pressure antinode could be sustained by Rayleigh
criterion. Profiles I, III and VI were recorded to produce tangen-
tial HFI, having peak pressures of 7 psi, 11 psi and 40 psi, respec-
tively, i.e. increasing amount of energy deposition near the com-
bustor wall produced increasingly stronger tangential instabilities.
Though the rocket scientists state that the formation of pressure
antinodes (powered by Rayleigh oscillations) near the wall are re-
sponsible for “Profile VI (injection near the chamber wall) resulting
in very strong tangential oscillations”, one must question this claim.
Acoustic waves (sound waves) are longitudinal waves that propa-
gate adiabatically , by compression and rarefaction [239] . Hence, for
a wave to be acoustic, it has to be sinusoidal with equal magni-
tude of over- and under- pressure [239] . These requirements can-
not be met in an oscillation with a peak pressure of 40 psi, because
of the high nonlinearity and impossibility of exhibiting a negative
40 psi oscillation (pressure cannot go below vacuum). As per the
thesis  put  forth  in  the  prior  sections,  it  seems  more  likely  that
shock waves are associated with Profile VI, and not sound waves. It
should also be mentioned that the observations from Anand et al.
[83] in hollow RDCs and Osborn et al. [237,238] in rocket engines
match — radial oscillations are produced when the fuel concen-
tration is at the combustor axis, and tangential oscillations (rotat-
ing detonations) are incurred when the concentration is close to
the combustor wall. It is likely that the concave wall of combus-
tors is a fundamental aspect of rotating detonation waves due to
the compressibility they provide to strengthen and sustain detona-
tion waves (explored in Section 3.1 ). This proposal may, however,
not be an absolute requirement since Bykovskii et al. [240] were
able  to  sustain  rotating  detonations  through  an  annular  layer  of
gaseous mixture injected radially outwards from a tubular struc-
ture, with no outer enclosing boundary. But, the short duration of
testing (0.2 s) and the fact that only pairs (four or five) of counter-
rotating detonation waves (which are inherently a transitory phe-
nomenon — (explored later in Section 8.2 ) were observed during
this time, should bring additional scrutiny to the basic physics that
allows such a phenomenon.

7. Exit conditions: pressure and nozzle effects

The previous sections dealt with the rotating detonation com-
bustor  itself  and  the  conditions  upstream  to  it,  i.e.  the  injec-
tion  and  plenum  elements.  Nevertheless,  equally  important  are
the boundary conditions downstream of an RDC. In this section,
the issues bearing on the effect of different types of nozzles on
RDCs  is  to  be  discussed  along  with  a  comprehensive  survey  of
the  effect  of  pressure  (atmospheric  vs.  backpressurized  vs.  vac-
uum) on RDC dynamics. Broadly speaking, based on the relative
cross-section of the RDC exit plane with respect to the combus-
tor cross-section, the nozzles can be either straight (just the annu-
lus with no area change), divergent or convergent (or convergent-
divergent). The straight nozzle RDC exit [46,180,241,242] is shown
in Fig. 24 a. Fig. 24 b shows two RDC schematics that produce an ex-
panding, or diverging, nozzle [243,244] . This configuration makes
use of the inner wall of the RDC to effect this [54,182,244–249] ,
whereas the second sub-type uses the outer wall to give a higher
exit area [243] . Note that both the walls can be used in tandem
to provide the required divergence as well [243,250] . The last type
is  an  RDC  with  a  CD  nozzle,  the  schematics  of  which  are  given
in Fig. 24 c. Here, once again, two methods have been used to at-
tain the required changes in area at the RDC exit. The first con-

sists of using an aerospike integrated within a rocket engine-type
CD  nozzle  that  produces  convergence  at  a  finite  distance  away
from the RDC centerbody [40,251–253] . The second method is to
use the RDC centerbody itself to have a notch on it (or, have an
aerospike with a bulging protrusion) to develop a CD section at the
exit [14,46,49,51,252] . In general, for stand-alone RDC applications,
shaped nozzle additions seem to be required to prevent strong re-
circulation zones at the exit of the engine [19,125] . Nozzle addi-
tion also causes considerable changes to the supersonic flow field
after RDC exit, as observed in Figs. 25 and 26 . These effects must
be taken into consideration when designing an RDC for integration
into existing engines.

Drastic variations in performance, defined in terms of specific
impulse, are noted between the three boundary conditions. For the
discussions herein, the baseline case will be that of the straight-
nozzled RDC. The specific impulse of the divergent nozzle is lower
in comparison to the baseline case, as established by both numeri-
cal and experimental studies [54,250,255] . The CD nozzled RDC, on
the other hand, provides considerably higher specific impulse than
the baseline, thereby making it the most efficient configuration of
all the cases [14,138,250,255–258] . For instance, Kato et al. report
a 10% increase when using a CD nozzle [257] . This is mostly at-

tributed to the presence of a sonic choke at the CD nozzle throat
which in turn causes a pressure increase upstream of the nozzle
[14,225,259] . Note that Fotia et al., and Paxson and Naples have
shown, mathematically, based on empirical evidence related to the
mass flow parameter (MFP) that RDC does indeed provide a stag-
nation pressure increase [14,15] , owing to the presence of one or
more detonation waves. It has also been speculated that this in-
crease in pressure upstream of the nozzle throat causes significant
deflagrative burning of the unburnt / vitiated mixtures, thereby ex-
tracting the maximum possible efficiency from these devices [260] .
It is emphasized here that the driving factor behind these perfor-
mance increases is linked to the increase in pressure in the com-
bustor, and not the mere nozzle geometry itself. This pressure in-
crease could be arrived at either by using a choked nozzle at the
exit [46] , or by increasing the ambient exit pressure aft of the com-
bustor using backpressurizing valves or operating in a high pres-
sure ambient medium [209] . Indeed, direct evidence for this is pre-
sented by Bykovskii et al. [209] who show that the most defin-
ing fact of backpressurized RDC operation — longitudinal pulsed
detonation which will be Section 8.3 — can be induced even in a
significantly expanded nozzle RDC configuration provided the exit
pressure is high enough. Roy et al. also observe LPD even though

their  RDC  had  a  straight  nozzle  [43] .  Overall,  the  reported  spe-
cific impulse in RDCs extend even up to 70 0 0 s with hydrogen-air
mixtures, with the caution that this would incur a tradeoff with
the thrust produced — a 20% thrust increase would require a 25%
decrease in specific impulse [260] . Irrespective, these results bode
positively for the attainment of the prospective benefits of RDCs.

Continuing further on the effect of pressure on RDC behavior,
other  than  just  its  import  on  the  global  performance,  Bykovskii
et  al.  found  that  it  exerts  significant  control  on  the  internal
combustion  and  fluid  mechanics  [134,244] .  The  normal  Mach
line of existence after which the products expand supersonically,
axially,  moves  considerably  upstream,  towards  the  RDC  injector
headwall, when the device is backpressurized [27,209] . It should
be  noted,  however,  that  further  proof  of  this  Mach  line  is  re-
quired to confirm its existence, as discussed in Section 2 . When
the  counterpressure  is  high  enough  at  the  RDC  exit,  the  shock
waves  from  the  exit  are  found  to  penetrate  the  fresh  injection
region ahead of the detonation front, thereby causing significant
stochastic occlusion of the feed orifices [209] . By utilizing several
hundred images acquired from their Plexiglas-integrated visualiz-
able RDC, Bykovskii et al. found that there is a sweet spot which
defines  RDC  operation  under  such  backpressurized  (subsonic
injection) conditions. This is based on the fill height of the fresh
reactants,  which  when  decreased  below  a  threshold  value  due
to  the  reflected  shock  waves  from  the  exit  causes  the  inception
and sustenance of LPD in their RDC. Above this threshold value,
the  RDC  is  still  able  to  sustain  rotating  detonations.  When  the
fill  height  is  reduced  even  further  than  that  of  the  LPD  regime,
completely  chaotic  detonation  is  observed  by  Bykovskii  et  al.,
which they attribute to a total breakdown of the injection process
and  destructive  coupling  between  the  reflected  waves  from  the
pressurized exit and the injector elements. Anand et al. [46] and
Codoni  et  al.  [261]  also  claim  a  reduction  in  mixture  fill  height
when the combustor is pressurized. The latter also observes highly
unstable  behavior  in  their  RDC  with  a  CD  nozzle.  Interestingly,
Schwer and Kailasanath [262] report that their three-dimensional

simulation  of  an  RDC  with  backpressure  encountered  glaring
issues stemming from very strong reflected waves from the nozzle
throat.  In  another  study,  they  report  seeing  strong  shock  waves
moving inwards towards the plenum when the RDC backpressure
is  increased  [92] ,  as  does  Paxson  [221] .  Moreover,  Anand  et  al.
[71]  and  Driscoll  et  al.  [133]  observe  an  RDC  conduct  similar
to  that  elucidated  by  Bykovskii  et  al.  However,  as  opposed  to
demarcating RDC behavior (LPD vs rotating detonation) based on
visual  imaging  and  estimated  fill  heights,  Anand  et  al.  attained
an  operating  map  based  on  pressure  ratios  across  the  air  inlet
and  combustor  across  multiple  flow  rates  and  geometries,  and
found  that  LPD  was  only  prone  to  occur  between  ratios  of  1.2
and 1.6. Anything higher tended to produce rotating detonations
and pressure ratios of injection lower than 1.2 tended to produce
completely chaotic detonations. The latter phenomenon of chaotic
detonation presence in RDCs will be dealt with later in Section 8.1 .
It is important to note here that the fill height is proportional to
the  pressure  ratios  across  the  injector.  Hence,  the  experimental
findings  from  the  above  researchers  concur  — when  the  RDC  is
backpressurized, it produces LPD by virtue of not having enough
fill height to sustain a proper rotating detonation. Bykovskii et al.
[209] thus arrive at the conclusion that RDC stability is inversely
proportional  to  the  backpressure.  They  also  tested  an  extension
of  this  idea  by  integrating  their  RDC  exhaust  to  a  vacuum  tank
with sub-ambient pressure conditions. This resulted in widespread
improvement  in  the  stability  of  the  rotating  detonation  waves
with  the  proposed  Mach  line  now  pushed  further  downstream,
close  to  the  exit  of  the  nozzle  [244] .  A  similar  behavior  is  also
observed at ambient exit conditions, but with expanding nozzles
[244] .  Therefore,  existing  data  on  RDC  suggests  a  conundrum:
increase the propulsive performance of the device at the cost of
stability, or sacrifice stability and probably the required mode of
operation at the price of higher efficiency. Note that the decreased
stability is inside the RDC chamber itself and not at the exit of the
nozzle  after  the  choked  throat.  Rankin  et  al.  [263]  and  Nordeen
et al. [40] remark that a CD nozzle addition causes the removal of

208

flow unsteadiness after the choked throat. Nordeen et al. further
found  that  the  flow  swirl  induced  by  the  very  motion  of  the
rotating detonation waves is curtailed by the CD nozzle, thereby
producing  an  exit  flow  field  without  any  significant  azimuthal
velocity component. This is in contrast to the other nozzles, where
a significant swirling flow is persistent in the exit flow field [40] —
this is well suited for turbine integration. Since most practical RDC
operation is bound to have a backpressure at its exit plane, either
by  having  a  choked  nozzle  or  turbine  blades  [264] ,  this  issue
is  posited  to  assume  paramount  importance  as  the  community
moves  towards  engineering  this  process  in  practical  applications
and  has  accordingly  been  given  increasing  attention  as  seen  by
the  specific  impetus  towards  pressurized  RDC  operation  [11,13–
15,43,46,49,51,54,133,136,138,182,209,250,251,255,257,258,260–
262,264–270] .

Unfortunately,  besides  the  above-mentioned  issues,  there  are
still many other complex secondary issues related to backpressur-
ized RDC operation. As explained earlier, Fotia et al. have shown
that  RDCs  sustain  stagnation  pressure  gain.  This  is  in  line  with
the  claims  of  Zel’dovich  [271] .  The  net  effect  of  this  increase  is
to produce a sharp transient increase in the static pressure inside
the combustor when its exit is choked by any appropriate means,
which is the RDC system attaining another new steady-state con-
dition from the initial conditions of cold-flow operation prior to
ignition. Predictably, all facilities running their combustor at back-
pressurized conditions show these sharp low speed pressure shifts
from their static gauge sensors [14,167,255,257,265] . Still, owing to
diverse factors, this transience is either ignored and not discussed
or has been even attributed to improper sensors [269,270] . How-
ever, as noted in Ref. [46] , there is indeed a physical, transient av-
erage static pressure increase when a backpressurized RDC is ig-
nited; lasting about 0.95 s for the conditions they tested. Fotia et al.
[14] ,  subsequently,  also  noted  the  same  transience  in  their  RDC
testing as well, but there it lasted between 0.75 s and 1.25 s, after
which it plateaued to a steady-state pressure. In this aspect, the
mean pressure shift in RDCs described above is similar to the “DC
shift” seen in rockets [272–279] . The DC shift (derived from the
electrical terminology of direct currents, owing to a net non-zero
average in the obtained signal) in rocket motors is defined as an
increase in the average static pressure of a combustor that almost
always accompanies the onset and sustenance of high frequency
combustion instabilities [66] . Interestingly, this DC shift instability
in rockets seemingly occurs only during the presence of HFI events
inside the combustion chamber, and its exact origins appear to be
unknown  to  the  specialists  dealing  with  it.  This  congruence  be-
tween HFI and DC shift is best explained in the words of Flandro
et al. [69] who conclusively proved the causality of the latter as an
effect of the former, and pronounced: “...the same mechanism that
drives the non-linear oscillations is also the source of the DC shift
phenomenon. This is a new result that has been shown to agree
very well with experimental data in the solid motor case.” Empha-
size is placed on the fact that liquid rocket engines [69] and hybrid
rockets [272] are also prone to witnessing DC shift; however, here
the average shift in pressure can either be positive (higher average
pressure than the time instant preceding its inception) or  nega-
tive (lower average pressure). Moreover, it is rarely seen in liquid
rockets,  which  is  suggestive  of  this  effect  being  dependent  on  a
major difference between motors and engines: in solid rockets the
burning rate increases proportionally to chamber pressure, thereby
causing an in-phase increase of consumed mass and rising pres-
sure,  whereas  in  liquid  rockets  the  momentary  average  increase
in the combustor static pressure incurs a lower injection pressure
drop (and therefore, lower mass flowrates) since the flow rates are
controlled by pumps, and therefore causes lower average pressures,
because  of  damping  [280] .  Thus,  caution  is  recommended  when

linking DC shift events in all rocket types with that seen in pres-
surized RDCs – there might be extra factors at play.

One  should  note  that  DC  shifts  usually  result  in  catastrophic
destruction  of  rockets,  specifically  solid  rocket  motors  [82,277] .
Fig. 27 a from Anand et al. [46] gives two pressure traces obtained
from the same flow rates, but at two different geometries — with-
out and with a CD choked nozzle at the exit. The clear shift in
mean pressure acquired by the high speed piezoresistive sensors
is patently seen. Provided in Fig. 27 b is two other pressure traces
from the data of Blomshield [277] , which was in turn used by Flan-
dro et al. to arrive at their highly accurate model to predict this
instability [66,69] . Red traces represent a normal functioning solid
rocket  motor  without  any  high  frequency  non-linear  oscillations
despite multiple pulsing (triggering to cause instabilities [59] ). The
blue trace is an operation characterized by the successful trigger-
ing and sustained presence of HFI. The phenomenon of DC shift
is clearly visible in the latter case, and is nonexistent in the for-
mer case. Owing to the tremendous increase in the static pressure
throughout the solid rocket motor, it underwent catastrophic fail-
ure at about 3 s. This is a direct result of DC shift, and establishes
its maliciousness in a rocket environment. As rightly pointed out
by Stechmann et al. the operating chamber pressures in RDCs at
present barely coincide with the lower threshold (25 bar) of what
would  be  expected  in  rocket-type  combustion  chambers  [281] .
Thus, one should expect DC shifts in RDCs to have as drastic an
impact as it does on rockets, as we move forward, towards higher
pressure variants required for conventional propulsion and power
generation systems. As was argued earlier, the difference between
RDC  and  a  rocket  engine/motor  in  HFI  operation  appears  to  be
a case of semantics dependent on the people researching it. The
work of Zhang et al. best exemplifies this argument, where they
call their hollow combustor with a de Laval nozzle a rotating det-
onation engine [136] . Another phenomenon of interest relevant to
rockets and other traditional combustors is the chugging instabil-
ity that is characterized by acoustic coupling between the injec-
tor plenums and the combustor [59,60,282–284] . It is considered
a type of low frequency instability (LFI) since the occurrence fre-
quency is below 500 Hz. Sometimes, this instability sets up “organ-
pipe” oscillations throughout the entire reactants supply manifolds
at distances significantly upstream of the combustor, as witnessed
in F-1 engines [59] . While the exact cause of its onset is yet un-
known,  it  appears  that  higher  reactants  feed  pressures  remove
this instability due to increased fluidic impedance across the in-
jectors that resist the feedback from the combustors [59] . Expect-
edly, akin to all the other kinships with rockets discussed so far,
RDCs also happen to exhibit chugging instability. While this is ob-
served even without backpressurization at select operating points
[225,285,286] , addition of pressure at the RDC exit appears to pro-
nounce  the  effects.  This  is  characterized  a  base-pressure  oscilla-
tion (frequency modulated signal on top of the carrier wave signal
that is from the detonation wave propagation) inside the combus-
tor, upstream of the choked nozzle throat. Fig. 28 a shows pressure
traces from static piezoresistive pressure sensors acquired during
pressurized RDC operation with a CD nozzle at the back end. Al-
though DC shifting is clearly visible from the traces after ignition at
about 0.1 s, one can also easily notice considerable low frequency
variations built on top of the detonation wave pressures. A mag-
nified  image  provided  in  the  same  figure  clearly  shows  the  fre-
quency modulated low frequency oscillation that is chugging in an
RDC annulus. Not coincidentally, numerical simulations performed
by Levin et al. [287] of an RDC fed from an air plenum with lin-
early decreasing stagnation pressure showed combustor pressure
traces very similar to the experimentally attained measurements.
This  is  seen  in  Fig.  28 b  which  gives  the  ratio  of  cycle-averaged

sinusoidal  oscillation)  static  pressure  to  the  constant  stagnation
pressure of the plenum in the y-axis and the time passed in x-
axis. The authors do not explain the origins for this “complex, pe-
riodic and oscillatory” behavior, but it was shown by a different
facility [225] , in a separate effort, that there is considerable mis-
match between predicted static pressure increases in the pressur-
ized combustor (using MFP and C-J detonation conditions) and the
measured pressures at the end of DC shift only at higher mass flow
rates. At lower flow rates, the developed model appeared to predict
the plateaued pressure rather well, leading to the suggestion that
higher flow rates produce highly inefficient combustion character-
ized by notable stagnation temperature losses.  Thus,  once  again,
there appears to be harmony in inferences across different facili-
ties to describe some of the RDC mechanics. This drastic and con-
tinual change in temperature was postulated to produce acoustic
oscillations defined as chugging.

8. Modes of operation at off-design conditions

8.1. Chaotic propagation

RDC  operation  near  the  lean  limits  tends  to  produce  non-
repeatable, varying pressure profiles suggesting the lack of proper
detonation  propagation  [132] .  These  traces  resemble  those  ob-
tained during the onset period shown in Fig. 19 . While the pres-
sure  suggests  the  presence  of  detonations  inside  the  combustor,
the  lack  of  repeatability  of  pressure  profiles  and  the  vastly  dif-
fering  detonation  speeds  [288]  suggest  the  disintegration  of  the
detonation  wave  into  a  deflagration  wave,  and  a  subsequent  re-
ignition  into  a  detonation  wave  again.  Kindracki  et  al.  proposed
this  mechanism  of  “small  detonation  wavelets  propagating  chaoti-
cally and eventually transitioning to deflagration ” and attributed it to
substandard mixing [132] . They also performed numerical simula-

cited at the same frequency of the rotating detonation wave, which
is indicative of high frequency coupling between the plenum and
the injector. An ideal RDC design should incorporate methods by
which this pressure feedback into the injectors is as low as pos-
sible  [206] .  However,  this  is  easier  said  than  done,  as  a  similar
plenum disturbance is caused in rocket engines also, when there is
rough combustion in the chamber. Shown in Fig. 30 d are the pres-
sure traces from the combustor, oxidizer injector and fuel mani-
fold used in F-1 engines [60,89] . During HFI in the combustor the
peak dynamic pressures were found to routinely increase instanta-
neously to 50 0 0 psi, causing a similar magnitude of oscillation in
the reactants supply assembly. Owing to the vast variety of vari-
ables to be considered when designing injectors, this problem has
been difficult to overcome [59,76] .

Because  of  this  inherent  randomness  in  wave  propagation,
when the RDC operates in this mode, it renders usual wave speed
calculations  futile,  since  speed  is  predicated  on  the  requirement
that there is a continuous wave travelling between two sensing lo-
cations [288–292] . Alternatively, an additional step could be incor-
porated in the usually simple time-of-flight algorithm to filter out
fallacious values by making sure that three consecutive speed mag-
nitudes fall within 10% of each other, thereby constituting what is
probably a full wave rotation [289] . This method has been used
successfully by Deng et al. to characterize wave speeds accurately
[222] . This type of RDC operation is widespread when the combus-
tor is backpressurized (choking at the nozzled exit causes injection
to become subsonic and hence once again uneven recovery caus-
ing substandard mixing). Chemiluminescence imaging [47,293] of
RDCs  with  subsonic  reactants  (atmospheric  and  backpressurized
cases)  injection  record  highly  chaotic  propagation  of  detonation
waves with considerable deflagration activity. This implies a loss of

tions of the process, by altering the injection conditions to effect
poor mixing. The resulting pressure trace, defined by stochasticity,
and  the  unwrapped  annulus  showing  multiple  detonation  waves
propagating transiently is seen in Fig. 29 [132] . The poor mixing
causing this process is due to under-recovery of supply plenums
owing to the reduced pressure ratio across the injectors which is
ineffective in counteracting the instantaneous high backpressures
produced by the detonation wave, and hence occurs at low flow
rates [132,209,289] . An example of the effect of detonation waves
on the injectors is seen in Fig. 30 a–c. Peak pressure values in the
air inlet and the base of the fuel plenum are about 60% and 20%
of the values seen inside the combustor [285] . They are also ex-

RDC’s prospective efficiency due to non-detonative burning of fuel.
Another offshoot of this mode is the directionality (clockwise to
counter-clockwise, and vice versa) of the rotating detonation wave,
which  is  observed  to  stochastically  change  within  the  same  test
point, across multiple facilities [18,186,197,199] . The drastic changes
in the wave’s direction have a considerable impact on its interac-
tion with the downstream and upstream components, owing to the
effect of the angular arrangement of the turbine vanes on the re-
flected shock wave from the detonation wave. Zhou et al. obtain
notably different pressure profiles and coupling with downstream
turbine vanes depending on the direction of rotation of the deto-
nation wave [294] . At higher flow rates, chaotic propagation and
directionality changes are present only during the transient onset
time and steady rotating detonation is formed after. Since an RDC
is required to operate unsteady by its very conception, high impor-
tance needs to be placed on injector design to avoid chaotic propa-
gations. At present, there are no design guidelines to approach this
problem in RDCs. It can also be concluded that during chaotic det-
onations, RDC operates as if it is in perpetual onset.

8.2. Multiplicity: co-rotating and counter-rotating waves

At certain conditions RDCs house more than a single rotating
detonation wave at a given instance inside the combustor annulus.
This occurs in two ways: (i) co-rotating, and (ii) counter-rotating.

In the first case, as the name implies, all the waves move in the
same direction, in contrast to the counter-rotating waves discussed
later in this section. The common finding among various studies
is  that  increasing the  mass flow  rates  seemingly increments the
number of rotating detonations [27,43,46,51,168,295,296] . RDC op-
eration with one wave [27,54,72,185,297] , two [10,27,46,168] , three
[10,27,42,43] , four [4 9,51] , five [4 9] , six [24,4 9] , seven [50] , eight
[49] and even nine waves [298] have been observed — see Fig. 31 .
Considering the content provided in the prior sections of this pa-
per,  not  surprisingly,  rocket  engines  are  also  susceptible  to  one
or more waves rotating about the combustor circumference; it is
called first, second-tangential spinning mode, and so on [59] , as
evident in Fig. 32 . Like RDCs, the direction of these waves is ran-
dom and prefers either clockwise or counterclockwise direction to
rotate [78] . In RDCs, smaller fuel orifice area [167] also supports
multiple detonation waves inside the combustor. While the waves
themselves might be relatively stable (repeatable wave speeds), the
actual switching from a wave mode to another (and sometimes,
back)  rather  abruptly  during  a  same  testing  duration  [289]  sug-
gests the presence of a strong instability associated with certain
RDC operating regions. Moreover, the peak pressures of the det-
onation in the chamber are much higher for one-wave mode, as
opposed to the two-wave mode — it is roughly about twice that
of the single detonation in one wave mode [295] . The symptoms
of  wave  multiplicity  extend  to  more  than  just  the  variations  in

peak pressures. When there is ascension to a higher-wave mode
in an RDC, the individual velocity of each wave drops sharply, as
seen  by  a  telling  plot  from  Bykovskii  et  al.  [27] ,  reproduced  in
Fig. 33 a. This multiplicity-linked velocity deficit from the idea C-
J speeds has also been a recurring theme about rotating detona-
tion waves [27,134] . In fact, when there is eight [49] or nine-waves
mode [298] , it was noted that they could be “acoustic waves” in-
stead of C-J detonations, owing to the very high wave speed deficit
(about 50%).

At present, neither the mechanism behind multiplicity nor the
deficit related to it is known. Irrespective, these phenomena can
be construed as a physical homeostasis peculiar to RDCs where the
magnitude of pressure and speed of each detonation wave in the
system varies depending on the number of detonation waves in the
system at any given moment, which in turn depends on a critical
fill height that each wave can consume [3] . This is the proposi-
tion by Zhdan and Syryamin [121] who show this issue to be an
eigenvalue problem and subsequently show that a stable solution
is  attained  when  the  domain  supporting  the  detonation  has  the
shortest possible length; or in other words, the equilibrium state
of RDCs is to have the highest possible number of waves at a given
time.  Bykovskii  et  al.  [27]  and  later  another  group  [167]  claim
that the ratio of this critical fill height (function of mass flux) to
cell width, λ, determines the number of detonation waves in the
combustor. Bykovskii et al. note from their extensive visualization
studies that the minimum h/ λ required to sustain a rotating det-
onation  wave  is  12 ±5,  after  which  it  would  bifurcate  into  unit-
incrementally higher modes. Using mass conversation conditions,
Ref. [167] estimates an h/ λ of about 7 for bifurcation to occur.
Though not explicitly stated, we can estimate the h/ λ values from
the data of Frolov et al. [51] and Rankin et al. [47] to be 8–11 and
2–5, respectively. Such a wide discrepancy does not lend itself to-
wards easy engineering of RDCs. Nevertheless, by altering the RDC
geometry using three channel widths and the mixture reactivity by
altering the amount of oxygen enrichment (at an almost constant
equivalence ratio), St.  George et  al.  also considered a third vari-
able - channel width - to ascertain its importance in determining
multiplicity [42] . Increasing the oxygen percentage (of the enriched
air  oxidizer)  at  a  given  channel  width  caused  a  shift  from  one-
wave to two-wave mode, and finally three-wave mode, for a given
channel width. A similar multiplicity behavior was also observed
when the channel width is reduced for a given oxygen percent-
age and equivalence ratio. The tangential speed of the individual
detonation waves decreases every time a new wave is spawned,
as reported by other studies. Assuming the cross-sectional area of
the rotating detonation to be a rectangle (dimensioned by the RDC
channel width and the detonation wave height), they recognized

that the three apparently independent factors — fill height, channel
width and mixture reactivity— could be linked together by normal-
izing the detonation wave’s perimeter (P) by the cell size, λ, of the
global mixture. A new detonation wave spawned when the ratio of
the perimeter of the individual rotating detonation wave’s P/ λ ex-
ceeds 7.4. To elaborate, one wave operation transcends to two wave
operation  when  P/ λ (a  function  of  mixture  reactivity  and  chan-
nel width) exceeds 7.4, for the given conditions of geometry and
flow rate. Another divergence from two waves to three waves oc-
curred when the normalized perimeter of the newly formed waves
increases above 7.4, as witnessed in Fig. 33 b. Thus, it is apparent
that detonation scaling that has been so successful in character-
izing the diverse behaviors seen in conventional detonation wave
propagation [21] is also useful in ascertaining rotating detonation
wave dynamics.

Finally, it is worth pointing out that this issue is far from re-
solved, as knowledge of the exact physics determining multiplic-
ity is lacking. Though there have been numerous numerical simu-
lations that have reported producing multiple rotating detonation
waves in their computational models, most have so far not been
able to predict the velocity deficits that go in tandem with wave
multiplicity.  Hence,  one  should  question  the  notion  of  excessive
presence  of  unburnt  pockets  of  cold  reactants  being  responsible
for this intriguing RDC behavior, which is what is contemplated by
many numerical studies [110,132,208,213,299,300] . Songbai et al.,
however, do observe a relative decrease in wave velocity with more
waves (dependent on the number of ignition points), but their ab-
solute individual wave speeds are very close to the C-J speed, un-
like  the  considerable  deficits  seen  experimentally  [301] .  Further-
more, they observe up to eight simultaneous waves in hydrogen-
air mixtures which has not been reported elsewhere. Even when
the  reactants  plenum  are  modeled  separately  (as  is  the  case  in
the real-world), it was found that numerical solutions over-predict
the velocities (measured speeds were 8% to 14% lower) despite ac-
curately  predicting  the  exact  number  of  co-rotating  waves  for  a
given condition of flow rate and geometry [302] . This discrepancy
between  predicted  and  measured  velocities,  however,  was  non-
existent  when  there  is  only  one  wave  [302] .  Hence,  it  is  appar-
ent that an integral part of fundamental detonation physics is still
missing  in  these  models.  Consideration  of  this  issue  would  pro-
vide closure of to the issue at hand, and once again, aid in treating
rocket engine combustion instabilities as well.

Counter-rotating  waves  are  also  observed  widely  in  RDCs
[47,48,123,145,196,261,299,303,306–309] . Their driving physics can
be  reasoned  to  be  quite  different  from  co-rotating  waves,  be-
cause  of  the  regime  and  nature  of  occurrence.  First,  counter-
rotation seemingly occurs only at lower flow rates [47,303,307,310] ,

which is in complete contrast to co-rotating waves which only oc-
curs  at  higher  flow  rates.  Second,  most  observations  of  counter-
rotations in RDC indicate that is a very transient event, that might
quickly evolve into a steadier mode within a finite passage of time
[196,299,309,310] . Though Bluemner et al. [303] have posited that
this is a steady-state process from their data it is possible that the
very short run durations used in their study (150 ms) might have
incurred this appearance. Further testing is required to claim that.
Third, there is very strong evidence that counter-rotation is linked
to the mixture quality inside the RDC. Rankin et al. observe that
for the same flow rates at a constant air injection width and to-
tal fuel injection area, counter-rotation is only seen for the case
with a smaller number of fuel holes [47] . OH ∗ chemiluminescence
of an RDC during counter-rotation mode is presented in Fig. 34 a.
This was attributed by Rankin et al. to improper mixing brought
about by the longer distance between each individual hole. Zahn
et al. see a similar behavior, where counter-rotation is a function
of the spacing between fuel injection holes [310] . Additionally, they
see two different types of counter-rotations: (i) stationary collision
point, and (ii) moving collision point [310] . In the first case the col-
lision point rotates about the annulus at a much lower frequency
than the detonation wave, whereas in the second case, the point
appears  to  be  fixed  at  a  given  azimuthal  sector.  Collision  point
has been defined by different researchers as that localized region
where the two (or sometimes more [299] ) opposite moving waves
pass each other [47,303] . During this interaction, constructive su-
perposition appears to cause a two-fold rise in peak pressures at
the collision points [310] . It should be realized that, experimentally
in an RDC, it is rather difficult to have direct evidence of whether
the waves after colliding merely pass over each other, or explode
(explosions causing another explosion) and retreat their respective
paths.  However,  it  could  be  inferred  from  the  visualization  data
of Bluemner et al. (see Fig. 34 b) that there is no time lag in the
waves’ speeds as they move about the annulus, suggesting no mo-
mentum loss — they are probably passing over each other.

Dubrovskii et al. have numerically studied this process and offer
a compelling explanation that tends to explain most of the exper-
imental observations [123] . They claim that the production of two
waves of varying strength is an inevitable component of the RDC
ignition process, especially in an annulus. Depending on the point
of ignition and how far away it is from the most reactable pocket
of  mixture,  the  stronger  wave  is  always  the  one  that  is  formed
closest to the fresh mixture. They further explain that owing to the
instantaneous backpressure produced by the detonation event after
ignition, the injector location closest to the ignition point will tend
to occlude, thereby causing what they call a “non-uniform spread-
ing” due to reactants inhomogeneity. This is clearly seen in their

Fig. 35.  Onset and propagation of two counter-rotating detonation waves after ig-
nition at a point slightly offset from the airline indicated by the broken white lines

images reproduced in Fig. 35 . Note that the very slight offset of the
ignition point from the air inlet manifold causes the right moving
detonation wave to be stronger in contrast to the left moving wave,
when they both collide with each other at the diametrically oppo-
site point (not seen here). This is implied to be an effect of DDT,
which requires sufficient mixture strength and distance to produce
a strong detonation wave [21] . In such a scenario of unevenly in-
tense  detonation  waves, Dubrovskii et  al.  further  note  that  their
simulations  always  resulted  in  the  “dominant” wave  exerting  its
influence over the other wave, since the latter originates in the tail
of  the  former,  thereby  only  consuming  inhomogeneous mixtures
(uneven  plenum  recovery  by  the  time  the  weak  wave  comes  to
the recovering injector elements) and hot products from the for-
mer wave. This can either result in a two-wave co-rotating mode
as seen in their three-dimensional simulations, or produce a sin-
gle rotating detonation wave as seen in experiments [299,303] . It
also explains the apparent difference in strength between the two
counter-moving  waves  (see  the  increased  speed  of  one  wave  in
comparison to the other in Fig. 34 ). It is of interest to note that
two-dimensional simulations of counter-rotating waves cause both
the  waves  to  extinguish  owing  to  the  lack  of  fresh  mixture  up-
stream to them [206] . This might be an effect of an inherent multi-
dimensionality of the process, or a result of assuming an ideal in-
jection.

In light of this theory, it could be formulated that the final out-
come  of  all  fixed  colliding  point  counter-rotations  is  to  become

214

moving colliding point counter-rotations that ends in either a one-
wave or multi-wave mode depending on the previously discussed
conditions of high flow rates and reactivity. One can also explain
the  propensity  for  this  process  to  occur  at  larger  fuel  injection
areas (but constant flow rates) by considering the fact that large
areas, and thus lower pressure ratios across the injectors, are af-
fected to a larger degree than injector designs with smaller areas
[46] . Since the former is disturbed more than the latter by the ini-
tial detonation event, it produced relatively pronounced inhomo-
geneity in the newly formed fill height region, which as Dubrovskii
et al. showed is the asymmetry that is essential to the subsidence
of counter-rotating detonation waves. Pointedly, co- and counter-
rotating waves are a prevalent type of azimuthal instability in an-
nular gas-turbine combustors [311–313] . However, there, it is com-
posed of rotating acoustic waves with equal strength in pressure
nodes and anti-nodes. It is for this reason that gas-turbine burn-
ers employ “symmetry breaking” — a process in which unevenness
in mixture distributed is effected by altering the geometry or type
of burners distributed over the combustor — to reduce azimuthal
instabilities [312] . Wolf et al. also show that a standing azimuthal
acoustic instability mode is always unstable since its natural state
is to rotate, which depending on the experiments can be between
seconds to hours [311,314] .

8.3. Longitudinal Pulsed detonation

Though  the  preferred  operating  mode  of  RDC  is  to  have
the  eponymous  rotating  detonation  inside  the  chamber,  it  has
been  observed  by  a  few  prior  studies  [27,43,48,51,133,170,209,
255,266,267,289,299]  that  at certain  geometries and  mass flow
rates, the RDC transitions from housing continuous rotating det-
onations to producing axially-moving pulsed detonation inside the
combustion chamber, like a PDC. This pulsation, which was first
observed  in  an  RDC  and  christened  longitudinal  pulsed  detona-
tion  (LPD)  by  Bykovskii  et  al.  [27,235,248,249] ,  is  an  intriguing
phenomenon  because  it  occurs  in  the  absence  of  any  mechani-
cal  valves  to  actuate  the  reactant  flow,  which  is  tantamount  to
a  PDC  of  the  simplest  design.  Additionally,  the  frequency  of  the
pulsation  is  noted  to  occur  in  the  kiloHertz  regime,  which  bet-
ters  the  operating  frequency  of  any  known  PDC  by  more  than
an  order  of  magnitude.  Frolov  et  al.  [51]  noted  the  existence  of
LPD  for  H
2 -air  mixtures  in  their  larger  RDC  with  a  diameter  of
406 mm. LPD was found to occur at 1 kHz at higher air injection
gap width. While a specific case of LPD was discussed for an op-
erating case with the higher injection area and a convergent noz-
zle (and hence presumptively a choked RDC exit leading to sub-
sonic air injection), it is unclear if they observed the phenomenon
without a choked exit. Simultaneous azimuthal pulsations in the
RDC are also noted by Wang et al. [48] during their RDC opera-
tion with vitiated air. It could be speculated that heat addition may
have caused a thermally choked exit in the RDC. While Frolov et al.
used ion probes in their study and Wang et al. used pressure sen-
sors in theirs, both concurred that the instigation for LPD started
downstream, near the RDC exit. Anand et al. [71,289] and Driscoll
et al. [133] observed LPD at lean operating conditions for H
2 -air
mixtures  with  a  CD  nozzle,  and  thus,  once  again,  subsonic  air
injection.

The proclivity to occur at subsonic air injection and lean equiv-
alence ratios was explained by Bykovskii et al. to be due to the
causality  of  having  a  backpressurized  RDC  which  causes  the  fill
height to drop below the critical value required to allow rotating
detonation wave existence, as explained in Section 7 on RDC exit
boundary conditions [209] . In terms of equivalence ratio, Bykovskii
et al. discovered that the LPD mode demarcates the regions of de-
flagrative combustion and rotating detonative combustion at lean
2 -air operation [170] . Flandro et al. [69] ob-
and rich limits of H

served a similar conduct in their pressurized RDC, where LPD was
only prone to occur between pressure ratios of 1.4 and 1.85. Be-
low and above this there was chaotic detonation existence and ro-
tating detonations, respectively. They subsequently proposed shock
wave  amplification  by  coherent  energy  release  (SWACER)  as  the
mechanism by which the weak reflected shock waves from an RDC
exit  can  cause  instantaneous  explosions  near  the  injector  head-
wall.  SWACER,  named  as  such  by  Lee  et  al.  [315]  in  analogy  to
LASER,  requires  a  mixture  with  gradually  varying  reactivity  that
would be susceptible to cause direct detonations when an acoustic
wave is incident on it [21] . A mutation of this effect is used in ho-
mogenous charge compression ignition (HCCI) engines and shock-
less explosion combustion (SEC) cycles [316] , and has even been
suggested to be responsible for pulsejet operation [317] . In RDC,
this was hypothesized to be the case, axially, during LPD Ref. [69] .
It was showed there is a complete occlusion of injector elements
circumferentially  during  LPD  in  an  RDC.  See  the  pressure  traces
from three azimuthal sensors in the air inlet in Fig. 36 a that shows
this simultaneous hammering of the slotted air inlet. During such
an event, it is reasonable to assume that there would be an axial
stratification of reactivity after the relaxation of the injectors. Pres-
sure traces ( Fig. 36 b) from four axially distributed pressure sen-
sors in the same RDC clearly shows the primary explosion (blue
peaks from Axial #1) which descends to a weak acoustic wave as
it moves towards the CD nozzle throat is given. This weak acoustic
wave after reflecting from the nozzle transforms into a weak shock
wave  (aqua  blue  trace  from  Axial  #4)  with  a  strength  of  about
1 bar and propagates upstream, finally causing another primary ex-
plosion in between Axial #1 and the headwall, thereby maintaining
the high frequency cycle of LPD. The frequency of operation was
also found to vary proportionally with the chamber pressure prior
to ignition and the global equivalence ratio. At this juncture, it is
imperative to point out that no numerical studies exist at present
that have been able to demonstrate LPD, even though it is a major
component of pressurized RDCs.

Similar to the notable kinships between tangential HFI in rocket
engines and rotating detonations in an RDC, liquid rocket engines
are known to be susceptible to longitudinal HFI, which is also char-
acterized by axially travelling pressure pulses between the injec-
tion head and the nozzle throat at frequencies greater than 1 kHz;
they are not yet comprehensively explained, despite the consider-
able research into the phenomenon during 1950–90 s [59,76] . An
example pressure trace during longitudinal LFI from a location near
a rocket engine injector headwall is presented in Fig. 36 c, where
the uncanny resemblance to the LPD pressure profile ( Fig. 36 b) is
patently seen. Male et al. [58] visually captured the onset of “lon-
gitudinal  shocks” moving  within  the  thrust  chamber  at  10 0 0 Hz
when fuel transition was effected from furfuryl alchohol to JP-3.
Hybrid modes of operation with both the longitudinal and other
high-frequency instability — lateral oscillations — at 60 0 0 Hz were
also recorded. The shock waves were found to occur with a maxi-
mum pressure ratio of 2.8, with the highest recorded pressure peak
of about 44 bar. Highly uniform rocket chamber erosion was ob-
served near the injectors for operations with the longitudinal in-
stability. A nonlinear analytical method to model this instability,
based on its “shock wave characteristics” was developed by Lores
et al. [318] , while conceding the model’s shortcomings in predict-
ing the triggering of the instability. Commendable work was done
by Berman et al. [319,320] in subsequent articles in visually charac-
terizing this longitudinal instability. They recorded the presence of
this “intermittent shock-type axial instability” around 10 0 0 Hz up-
stream of the nozzle throat when the total reactants flow rate was
lowered beyond a critical value, for a constant head pressure drop
(pressure ratio  across  injectors).  Moreover,  the  instances of  tests
producing these instabilities became progressively scant when the
nozzle throat area is gradually increased. In RDC terminology, both

these parameters would result in decreasing the effect fill height
of  fresh  reactants  — however,  since this was  observed in rocket
engines no such inferences were made. Using a novel moving slit
photography  technique,  their  partially  transparent  rocket  engine
revealed a process consisting of an upstream moving shock wave
with gradually increasing strength, which eventually impinges on
the  injector  head  (with  an  absolute  velocity  of  1005 m/s),  and
almost  instantaneously  initiates  a  highly  luminous  downstream
propagating  shock  wave  (absolute  velocity  of  1433 m/s).  Berman
and Cheney also observed that the presence and strength of this
longitudinal instability is a function of the angle of convergence of
nozzle throat (amplifier and reflector), injector type, and chamber
length, finally concluding that while the chamber pressure (predi-
cated by flow rate and throat area) had a significant influence on
this instability, the head pressure drop across the injectors was the
driving factor. In synopsis, the above-mentioned sources on rocket
engine combustion instability implicitly attribute the phenomenon
in rocket thrust chambers to be caused due to periodic explosions.
The  confluence  of  similar  observations  made  by  disparate  facili-
ties over a period of several decades should not be assumed to be
merely happenstance, and evidence suggests that LPD in an RDC
is dictated by the same physics as longitudinal HFI in rocket en-
gines. Gray-scale images (during LPD) morphed from the voltage
magnitudes of 9 axially arranged ion probes and 8 circumferen-
tially distributed ion probes in an RDC operated by Frolov et al.
[51] are given in Fig. 37 a. Since the x-axis is time, one can see the
periodic excursion of combustion events (ionization activity gath-
ered by the probes) from the injector headwall (bottom edge of
the image) to the choked nozzle throat section (top edge). The in-
stantaneity of the pulsed explosions can also be observed based
on the relative time the combustion wave spends near the injec-
tors. Since LPD is azimuthally simultaneous, the circumferential ion
probes are excited at the same time, and hence appear as vertical
bands when the x-axis is unwrapped in the temporal coordinate.

In Fig. 37 b, high speed images captured during longitudinal HFI by
Berman and Cheney [319] in their rocket engine using a continu-
ous rolling strip camera (of the type Bykovskii et al. use for RDC
visualization)  is  laid  out.  Again,  the  remarkable  qualitative  simi-
larity between the processes in the supposedly different engines
is  hard  to  neglect.  Thus,  this  pulsed  detonation  instability  in  an
RDC is of paramount importance, because: 1) it could commence
research into truly valve-less PDCs with an increase in frequency
by at least an order, 2) it is imperative to understand this signifi-
cant instability, if literal employment of RDCs is ever to be realized
since most RDC operation would require it to be pressurized, and
3) understanding the kinship between the longitudinal instabilities
in  rotating  detonation  engines  and  rocket  engines  would  greatly
further the development of both propulsive devices.

8.4. Low frequency oscillations/instabilities

LFI  in  an  RDC  seems  to  be  almost  ubiquitous,  and  is  quali-
fied by sinusoidal variations in the maximum pressure of multiple
laps  of  rotating detonations.  A  brief  survey  of  the  pressure-time
traces  published  by  the  different  RDC  facilities  worldwide  gives
concrete evidence of the overarching existence of this instability
[72,73,132,166,168,182,185,198,285,289,295,303,321] . Two very alike
hypotheses were put forth initially to explain LFI in an RDC. Anand
et al. [290] and Liu et al. [166] proposed that the occlusion caused
by  the  detonation  wave  as  it  passes  by  the  injector  elements
causes  the  next  lap  of  the  wave  to  see  a  less-than-optimal  fill
height  which  was  posited  to  cause  the  current  lap  to  weaken
in  strength.  This  weakened  lap  of  detonation  wave  would  then
produce  a  lesser-than-average occlusion  on  the  injectors  thereby
causing the succeeding lap to pass through an optimal fill height
thereby making the wave stronger again. This cycle of feedback be-
tween “fluidic hammering” of the injectors and detonation wave
strength was used to explain LFI in RDCs. Yet, this proposed pro-

injector elements (Reprinted from Ref. [319] with permission from American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics).

cess does not explain why a “packet” of LFI is composed of more
than  three  waves;  in  actuality  there  are  anywhere  between  five
and about five hundred rotating detonations per packet of LFI, de-
pending  on  the  flow  rates  and  fuel  injection  hole  sizing  [290] .
Since both of the above facilities employed only one pressure sen-
sor in the combustor, they subsequently have drawbacks in accu-
rately capturing the spatial variance of LFI, and hence the inference
presented  could  be  corrupted.  Follow  up  studies  have  identified
three distinctly different types of LFIs in RDC [322] . While all three
types are characterized by a sinusoidal amplitude modulation of
the rotating detonation wave’s peak pressure, their driving mecha-
nisms appear to be divergent: (i) acoustic resonance-induced spa-
tially homogenous oscillations in the air injector, (ii) detonation-
induced disturbance causing spatially non-homogenous oscillations
in  the  same  injector,  and  (iii)  combustion-induced  spatially  ho-
mogenous oscillations inside the combustor. The first two types of
LFI are linked to the supply plenum dynamics [225,285,286] , and
the last is inherently combustion-induced [83] . One could differen-
tiate the first two types from the last one by recording the wave
speed between subsequent laps of rotating detonations. Only the
combustion-induced LFI manifests a sinusoidal variation in succes-
sive laps’ wave speeds in addition to the oscillation in the wave’s

peak pressures [83] . No such congruence is observed in the first
two.  For  the  first  case,  a  “locked-in” [323] ,  azimuthally  simulta-
neous, low frequency mode was observed at 235 Hz in the air in-
let, at all air and fuel flow rates tested, which was attributed to
a Helmholtz resonation coupling between the air plenum and the
combustor [225,285,286] . The locked-in oscillations in the air inlet
manifests as a low frequency instability in the combustor, albeit
at a broader frequency range [289] . Such a coupling is observed
in gas-turbine combustors with a choked exit nozzle [324] and is
also similar to the chugging instability widely reported in rocket
engines. There also, it is proclaimed to depend on supply line and
plenum acoustics. Additionally, similar to chugging occurrence in
most rocket engine occurrences [325] , the RDC chugging instabil-
ity exists usually only during the initial transient phase after ig-
nition of the engine, suggesting it might be linked to the system
reaching a new dynamic state after ignition [225,285,322] . An ex-
ample pressure trace from the air inlet of an RDC during chugging
(showing the base-pressure oscillation) and the associated locked-
in chugging frequency 235 Hz) along with the detonation wave fre-
quency (3642 Hz) is given in Fig. 38 a and b. In Fig. 39 , a similar

genic methane-oxygen rocket engine (part of the broader Propul-
sion and Cryogenic Advanced Development project) is given [326] .
Hulka  and  Jones  report  LFI  across  most  of  the  injector  patterns
tested,  with  frequencies  between  150–250 Hz.  For  select  injector
configurations, chugging magnitude was lowered by increasing the
injection  pressure  ratio.  Once  again,  it  is  worth  noting  that  the
asymmetric, shock-fronted pressure traces with peak overpressures
exceeding 50 psi were attributed to acoustic modes in the chamber.
The second type of LFI is distinguished by a slow-moving ro-
tary event in the combustor and the air inlet and combustor [286] .
Fig. 40 a shows pressure traces from three sensors distributed at
three azimuthal locations 120 ° from each other in an RDC air in-
let from the study of St. George et al. [327] that shows the sec-
torally varying, non-homogenous nature of this instability. Fig. 40 b
shows the same type of instability in the facility of Bluemner et al.
[303]  during  counter-rotating  detonation  waves  propagation  (de-
scribed in detail in Section 8.2 ). Note that counter rotation pro-
duces a crisscross of the low frequency packets (see the relative
position  of  the  dark  blue  packets  with respect  to  the  aqua blue
and yellow packets as the test progresses). It is evident that, once
again, the individual wave’s high-speed motion causes a low speed
AM  event,  and  should  thus  be  taken  to  be  independent  of  the
mode (one-wave, multi-wave, counter-rotating, etc.). This type of
LFI is also witnessed in rocket engines during it sustaining tangen-
tial HFI and is termed a “precessing tangential mode” [59] . Fig. 40 c
shows this mode in a rocket engine as recorded by four pressure
sensors distributed at different azimuths in the combustor, record-
ing about 8 cycles/ period. In RDC, this rotary sinusoidal oscilla-
tion  in  detonation  peak  pressure  moves  in  a  direction  opposite
to  the  direction  of  the  rotating  detonation  wave,  and  was  sub-
sequently hypothesized to be caused due to a complex construc-
tive and destructive interference of the shock waves leaked into
the supply plenum [286] . This is based on experimental and nu-
merical studies that show the detonation wave significantly alter-
ing the plenum dynamics owing to the locally high peak pressures
[206,218,224,328] . A trailing shock wave that is attached to the ro-
tating detonation wave tends to travel into the reactants plenum,
thereby significantly altering the dynamics [206,218,224] . Schwer
and Kailasanath note the existence of a subsequent reflected wave
(from the back of the plenum) that is spawned when this trail-
ing shock wave reaches the base of the reactants plenum [206] .
This reflected wave moves in a direction opposite to the detonation
wave, in the latter’s frame of reference [206,208] . Fotia et al. note

that the trailing shock wave moves at about 60% of the rotating
detonation wave’s speed and proposed the possibility of “pressure
beating” inside the slotted air injector owing to the relative differ-
ence in the two speeds [224] . However, in their two-dimensional
experimental unwrapped analogue of the RDC-plenum system, this
pressure beating effect was not observed due to the study using
only a single detonation wave (rotating detonations cannot be pro-
duced in a linear setup). Bluemner et al. [303] , on the other hand,
attribute this rotating low frequency instability to the presence or
absence of counter-rotating detonation waves. The sinusoidal fluc-
tuations are attributed due to the constructive/destructive interfer-
ence occurring when two opposite-moving waves pass each other.
It remains to be seen if one or both of the above theories — re-
flected shock wave emanating from the plenum / counter-rotating
waves’ interaction — is true regarding the origins of this rotating
instability.

Finally, the last LFI type is linked to the combustion wave dy-
namics. It was shown that such an LFI is marked by a complex in-
terplay between the pressure wave and the combustion front that
together make a revolving wave. During stable operation in a hol-
low RDC, the shock wave precedes the combustion front, whereas
during LFI-defined unstable operation in the same RDC, the com-
bustion wave precedes the pressure wave implying the presence
of the phenomenon of flame-acceleration in ducts causing a det-
onation wave, rather than a detonation event itself. This process
is similar to the alternative coupling and decoupling of the shock
wave and combustion front, which is observed widely in unstable
detonation propagation at near-limits in tubes [21] . This LFI was
discussed extensive in Section 1.2 . The field of instabilities analy-
sis in RDCs is nascent in comparison to the decades of research
on the same in rocket engines, where there are considerable un-
knowns even at present. Considering the crippling effects of LFI in
rocket engines, supersonic inlets and hypersonic vehicles owing to
their tendency to couple with the natural resonant frequency of
the structure [70,230] , it is imperative to acknowledge and treat
LFI as we move forward with RDC research.

9. Heat production and transfer

As can be noted from the preceding and succeeding sections, it
is apparent that tremendous strides have been made with regard
to understanding the internal physico-chemical mechanics of RDCs
within the last few years. While there are still many outstanding

issues to be resolved, perhaps none is more pressing and adverse
to overcome than the heat loading produced by RDCs. By virtue of
using detonation to combust fuel, extreme product temperatures
are an inherent nature of RDCs, which in turn causes structural and
sensor-related degradation. The wall surface exposed to the gases
shows rises to 10 0 0 K (from atmospheric conditions) in 3.5 s after
ignition in the study of Randall et al. [329] , whereas it increases
to about 500 K in the experiments by Bykovskii et al. [330] , and
to 1600 K in 2.5 s in Kindracki’s experiments [264] . Falempin et al.
note a climb to approximately 1300 K in 0.6 s when their RDC is
run  on  kerosene  –oxygen  and  to  10 0 0 K  in  0.35 s  when  run  on
hydrogen-oxygen, and subsequently propose composite RDC walls
to overcome this drastic heat transfer [331] . Ishihara et al. record
a  temperature  growth  to  up  to  10 0 0 K  after  6.3 s  since  ignition
at higher flow rates in their carbon-carbon composite-bodied RDC
running on ethylene-oxygen [332] . Despite using composites, the
last study reported significant thermal erosion of their wall. This

is the primary reason that a vast majority of experimental tests
from across multiple facilities worldwide curtail their hot-fire du-
rations to within a second [330,331,333] . So far, the longest pub-
licly reported continuous RDC operation under detonative regime
is 30 s by Stoddard et al. [142] , by making use of their 3D-printed
and water-cooled, flow-through RDC which does not require head-
wall cooling, on account of the lack of the very structure. The sec-
ond longest run was demonstrated by Ishihara et al. [257] and Roy
et al. [43] , who achieved a run time of 6–10 s. This is closely fol-
lowed by Aerojet Rocketdyne who tested their RDC for about 7 s
[334] . Other long duration tests are usually about 3 s, as seen in
the publications of Randall et al. [329] and Kindracki [264] . The
obvious result of such relatively short testing durations is that the
sub-field of heat transfer characteristics of RDC is rudimentary, ow-
ing to the lack of a steady-state heat transfer analysis. Despite this,
multiple studies have lent significant insights using a wide array of
techniques, both numerical and experimental.

Since the primary source of heat in RDCs is the rotating detona-
tion wave (and LPD, depending on the mode), the temperature pro-
duced therein is of foremost importance. Because the detonation
wave propagates in the kiloHertz regime, traditional temperature
sensing  using  thermocouples  cannot  capture  the  time-resolved
temperature values of the waves. This necessitates usage of state-
of-the-art  techniques  for  accurate  high-frequency  measurement.
Goldstein et al. used two-color tunable diode laser (TDL) absorp-
tion sensors in a high-bandwidth, scanned-wavelength-modulated
spectroscopy setup to attain temperature and H2O information at
the throat section of a nozzled RDC [335] . The two sensors used in
the tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS) technique
had different characteristics, with the first one utilizing two near
infra-red TDLs modulated at 225 kHz and 2858 kHz, whereas the
second sensor used two mid-infrared TDLs that were modulated
at 90 kHz and 1132 kHz. By integrating the two sensors in an or-
thogonal, co-planar arrangement at their throat, it was shown that
2 O  oscillation  frequency  obtained  by  this
the  temperature  and  H
method coincided precisely with the detonation wave frequency,
thereby giving credence to the notion of time-resolved tempera-
ture diagnostics. Both sensors recorded a temperature oscillation
about  1500 K  per  lap  at  the  nozzle  throat.  Increasing  the  global
equivalence ratio tended to increase the recorded average temper-
ature; however no such trend was observed for H
2 O mole fraction.
McGahan  et  al.  also  applied  the  TDLAS  technique  in  two  differ-
ent RDC geometries (same combustor diameter, but different noz-
zle throat diameters) to attain not only temperature and water va-
por concentration like the previous study, but also velocity at the
measuring  location  [336] .  Note  that  unlike  the  last  study  which
measured at the nozzle throat, this one contained sensors instru-
mented in a duct a finite distance away from the throat. Across di-
verse flow rates, the average temperature of the exhaust tended to
stay around 1500 K, like the prior study. They also reported mean
velocities  of  around  400 m/s  at  the  exhaust  duct,  while  conced-
ing  that  this  value  could  take  into  account  acoustic  modes  that
might  incur  inside  the  duct  /  RDC.  Rein  et  al.  also  used  a  tun-
able laser system (at 100 kHz) to record gas temperatures, but this
time inside the actual RDC annulus (and by extension, the deto-
nation  region),  and  not  at  the  exhaust  [337] .  This  was  achieved
by using multiple photodiodes to decipher the difference between
the transmitted light through sapphire windows on the RDC outer-
body  and  the  subsequent  reflected  light  from  a  mirror-polished
RDC inner-body. A given cycle of rotating detonation varied from
10 0 0 K  (deflagration)  to  1500 K  (detonation)  at  0.61 kg/s  at  stoi-
chiometric hydrogen-air conditions, 25.4 mm away from the RDC
headwall. Interestingly, this value changed considerably at differ-
ent air flow rates, even when the equivalence ratio was maintained

constant,  with  the  lowest  flow  rate  of  0.15 kg/s  exhibiting  very
minimal temperature oscillations about 500 K, suggesting chaotic
detonations ( Section 8.1 ). A follow-up study from Rein et al. ex-
tended their prior setup to four axial sensing locations / beams (si-
multaneously) thereby arriving at a rigorous characterization of ro-
tating detonation wave temperature in both space and time, at dif-
ferent flow rates and equivalence ratios [338] . A remarkable find-
ing from this study was that both the average and peak-to-bottom
temperatures, cycle-to-cycle, was lowest and comparable for axial
locations right near the headwall and right at the exhaust. It was
higher at the mid-axis regions of the RDC (see Fig. 41 a — beam 1
is closest to the headwall and beam 4 is farthest).

Incidentally, a similar (but not same) finding was also reported
by  Bykovskii  et  al.  [330]  in  their  acetylene-air  and  hydrogen-air
powered RDCs using six axially distributed Chromel-Alumel ther-
mocouples  ensconced  in  steel  casings.  Though  testing  was  per-
formed only for about 0.5 s, and therefore not thermally steady-
state,  highest  average  temperatures  were  measured  at  the  mid-
plane,  where  the  detonation  front  attaches  to  the  oblique  shock
wave, followed by locations near the injector headwall (detonation
front itself), and finally axial locations near the exhaust (product
gases).  Kindracki  performed  a  similar  experiment  of  axially  dis-
tributed type-k thermocouple array to reveal that, contrarily, his
RDC has highest average temperature closest to the headwall [264] .
However, it is to be remarked that the used thermocouples had a
specified range of 1600 K, and hence the higher values recorded
by the different sensors by the end of the test needs to be cau-
tiously interpreted. Bykovskii et al. explained the tendency to have
lower temperature at the detonation wave location to be due to
regenerative cooling provided by the high-velocity fresh mixture
that is injected during every passage of the wave. Incidentally, re-
generative cooling due to pronounced convection at the fill zone
is used also by Roy et al. to explain the same observation seen in
their 1-D analytical and 2-D numerical models [339] . Since their
model  was  validated  to  an  appreciable  degree  with  the  experi-
mental results of Randall et al. who characterized the temperature
rise  time  using  type-k  thermocouples  at  different  depths  along
the  combustor  outer-wall  [329] ,  one  needs  to  properly  consider
this  effect  in  future  studies  on  rotating  detonation  wave’s  heat
production.

Overall,  numerical  simulations  tend  to  accurately  predict  the
detonation  wave  temperature  and  structure  well,  as  seen  in
Fig. 41 b where detonation temperatures are alike to that obtained
by  the  multi-beam  technique.  Rankin  et  al.  used  mid-infrared
imaging  using  a  high  speed  camera  integrated  with  a  bandpass

below  the  detonation  propagation  frequency  in  their  RDC,  they
were  able  to  attain  instantaneous  images  from  select  frames
to  affirm,  both  qualitatively  and  quantitatively,  the  detonation
wave  shape  and  size  acquired  from  the  simulations  performed
by Cocks et al. [205] . The detonation wave temperature from the
simulations of Cocks et al. matches well with the experimentally
obtained temperatures from the multi-beam method of Rein et al.
These results bode well for the predictive capability and efficacy of
numerical simulations in understanding RDC dynamics. By using
convective  boundary  conditions  Roy  et  al.  estimate  that  a  long
duration RDC operation (10 min) would inevitably result in ther-
mal fatigue of the metallic walls owing to the asymptotic trend of
the wall temperature towards the product gas temperature inside
the RDC, and suggest that a hollow RDC is preferable to avoid the
requirement of cooling by convection two walls of the combustor
[339] . Fundamental calorimetry estimation based on the flow rate
of water and the associated change in water temperature was used
to arrive at accurate values of convective coefficients by Stevens
et al. in their RDC geometries [341] . They tested two outer-bodies,
which differ in their thickness and the number and geometry of
water cooling passages, at different flow rates and backpressuriza-
tion  (atmospheric  vs.  with  nozzle)  to  reveal  that  the  convection
coefficient  ranges  from  300  to  900 W/m 2 -K.  It  was  found  to  be
proportional  to  the  detonation  wave  frequency  and  the  extent
of back-pressurization (which would cause extensive pre-burning
throughout  the  combustor  due  to  a  choked  exit  downstream),
and appears to marginally increase with increased mass flux and
heat  addition  (equivalence  ratio).  These  values  are  noted  to  be
in  line  with  those  attained  by  Ishihara  et  al.  (627 W/m 2 -K  to
1114 W/m 2 -K, depending on the axial location in the combustor)
and Meyer et al. (20 0–10 0 0 W/m 2 -K) [342] .

The latter result from Meyer et al. is a part of a broader en-
deavor  from  AFRL,  which  has  pioneered  heat  flux  characteriza-
tion of RDCs using specially made resistance temperature detector
(RTD) sensors. A trial-and-error process was carried out to over-
come the considerable challenges using them in their initial stud-
ies on account of sensor destruction [333,343] . Increase in mass
flow  rate  and  equivalence  ratio  always  tended  to  raise  the  heat
flux  to  the  walls.  Using  time-synced  high  speed  chemilumines-
cence  imaging  from  the  aft-end  and  an  array  consisting  of  axi-
ally arranged four two-sided RTD sensors, Theuerkauf et al. found
that  the  unsteady  heat  flux  of  an  RDC  has  a  distinctly  different
profile  during  the  onset  time,  not  exceeding  4  MW/m 2  until  a
duration  of  100 ms  (onset  time  in  their  RDC)  [306] .  After  onset

and during steady operation, however, individual detonation laps
tended to produce at least 4 MW/m 2 cycle-to-cycle, with the ten-
dency to even exceed 9 MW/m 2 routinely. They also note intrigu-
ing instances of negative heat fluxes after detonation wave passage,
which was theorized to be due to the high-velocity reactants fill
region recovering after detonation passage. This would be in accor-
dance with the regenerative cooling process proposed by Bykovskii
et  al.  and later  by  Roy  et  al.  This study  was furthered by  using
a  heat  flux  surface  sensor  consisting  of  a  twelve  element  array
that was able to accurately capture the detonation wave structure
based on part-dependent heat production [344] . A quasi-two di-
mensional, single species, reactive Euler equations-based numerical
simulation performed by Paxson, to attain heat flux data for similar
flow rates and combustor size showed congruence with the exper-
imentally attained heat flux shape, but over-predicted the actual
values by 40%. This is seen in Fig. 42 . A follow-up study by Meyer
et al. utilizing the twelve-element array gauge in addition to TD-
LAS sampling of the gas in the annulus derived, for the first time,
high frequency heat transfer coefficients [342] . Significant lap-to-
lap  variations  in  heat  flux  was  reported  for  the  largest  annulus
width of 22.9 mm, which was attributed to the possibility of the
detonation wave exhibiting considerable radius-wise motion in ad-
dition to the circumferential propagation [345] . However, the rela-
tionship between heat flux and channel width exhibited a com-
plex,  non-linear  trend.  Moving  from  a  7.6 mm  annulus  width  to
16.3 mm width produced a decrease in flux by 73% −82%, whereas
moving from 16.3 mm to 22.9 mm caused a heat flux increase of
12%. The exact reason behind this is unknown currently, but was
alluded to be a function of the strength and size of the recircu-
lation zone associated with their injection scheme [339] . Further
experimentation is required to validate this. One also needs to con-
sider the findings of Schwer and Kailasanath, who argued that the
mixedness of the fill region, the injector size and shape and even
the supply plenum pressures controlled the minutiae of heat re-
lease from different regions of the combustor [346] . Additionally,
both Bykovskii et al. and Stevens et al. report higher heat flux dur-
ing higher modes of operation, such as two waves or more. It is
unclear if this is an effect of the implicit efficiency of multi-wave
modes in burning the reactants, or the higher heat loading pro-
duced  by  having  an  increase  in  the  operating  frequency  of  the
device.  Addition  of  an  aerospike  nozzle  (probably  a  choked  exit
which can cause LPD, as discussed in Section 8.3 ) appears to cause
a notable change in the location of the highest heat flux — it in-
creased at lower axial locations, but decreased at regions close to

the nozzle [345] . However, it is unclear if this constituted a funda-
mental mode change to LPD. These are open questions that are yet
to be answered.

Similar to the above sections where an effort was made to link
the  findings  from  RDC  to  those  from  rocket  engine  combustion
instabilities, we offer a very peripheral discussion of the subject
here. Time and again, during HFI in rockets, the highest erosion
levels are either reported at the injector headwall and the com-
bustor wall close to it or at the nozzle throat section, depending
on if the HFI is tangential (spinning) or longitudinal, respectively.
Both these erosion mechanisms have proven to be catastrophic to
rocket engines resulting in instances where the injector headwall
causes a significant degradation producing highly uneven reactants
injection leading to an explosion, or producing enough heat load-
ing and structural degradation at the nozzle throat to cause the
nozzle  to  completely  separate from  the  main  combustion  cham-
ber. Though it has been reported that the highest heat flux is not
at the injectors in an RDC, we should also consider the observa-
tions of Cho et al. who saw detonations through ethylene-air mix-
tures lifted-off from the injector wall to a higher distance than that
through hydrogen-air [347] . This “stand-off” behavior was postu-
lated to be due to the lower reactivity of ethylene which induces a
finite distance to react. Considering that Nordeen et al. also notice
this stand-off behavior in their simulations when there is higher
“un-mixedness” upstream of the detonation wave [103] , one needs
to consider the possibility that the injection style used predomi-
nantly in RDCs (slotted oxidizer-holes for fuel) or even the mixture
itself could be the driving factor that causes lower heat flux at the
injector headwall. Moving forward, one should expect these pitfalls
in long duration RDC operation as well, which makes an in-depth
analysis of heat production in an RDC even more important. Be-
sides these systems-level impact of heat flux, numerical study by
Wang et al. report a fundamental change in the rotating detonation
wave structure (radially) when the wall temperature is maintained
at or above 800 K — an oblique detonation is formed adjacent to
both the inner and outer walls of the annulus due to heightened
kinetic rate of reaction at the boundary regions near the wall [348] .
Increase  in  the  rotating  detonation  wave  speed  is  also  observed
when the RDC wall heating is significant. It is the contention of the
authors that heat transfer characteristics of an RDC is the foremost
impediment in its path to realize highly efficiency power genera-
tion and propulsion systems.

10. Emissions

10.1. Pollutants

Owing to a variety of issues ranging from very short experimen-
tal run times due to prohibitions from pronounced heat transfer
from the detonation wave to the lack of a well-established exper-

imental methodology to characterize the spatially and temporally
varying wave, studies pertaining to gaseous pollutants emissions
from  RDCs  are  sparse.  At  present,  open  literature  contains  only
two studies — one numerical and the other experimental — that
deals specifically with RDC emissions characteristics. Numerically,
Schwer  and  Kailasanath  [349]  used  the  Jachimowski  H2/O2  ki-
netic  mechanism  [350]  which  was  later  incorporated  with  NOx
chemistry as a 12 species, 27 steps reaction by Yungster [351] to
tackle  pulsed  detonation  combustion  to  attain  two-dimensional
RDC emissions profile with representative hydrogen-air mixtures.
The greatest production of NOx occurred right after the detonation
front,  where  the  temperature  is  highest  (see  Fig.  43 a).  Three
independent  parameters  were  studied;  namely,  feed  pressure  in
the plenums, equivalence ratio and RDC length and radius. While
the NOx emissions index varied from 1 to 26, it strongly depended
on some of the varied parameters. Feed pressure and RDC length
were  found  to  cause  a  negligible  change  in  NOx  production,
whereas equivalence ratio impacted a considerable variation with
a lower equivalence ratio of 0.6 producing a NOx flux of 20 ppm in
contrast to stoichiometric conditions that produces about 500 ppm
— emissions  indices  reduce  by  about  16  times.  This  is  to  be
expected since NOx emission is a function of temperature, which
in turn is dependent on the hydrogen-air equivalence ratios [352] .
NOx  emissions  were  also  found  to  vary  proportionally  with  the
RDC  radius  owing  to  the  increase  in  residence  times  at  higher
temperatures (bigger volume for the mixture to traverse). By ex-
tension, having multiple waves in the device also produced lower
emissions because of the decrease in residence times. Nonetheless,
this needs to be confirmed by experiments.

Experimentally, a flow-through hollow water-cooled RDC pow-
ered by hydrogen and enriched air was run for 30 s to allow for
proper plateaued measurement of NOx emissions at a single oper-
ating point ( Fig. 43 b), which was tested multiple times to ensure
statistical rigor [142] . Four different locations at the aft-end of the
combustor were sampled to gather the emissions profile across the
RDC cross-section. Highest NOx was produced consistently by the
combustor wall, whereas there was almost no NOx being recorded
at the central axis of the device. This is attributed to the inher-
ent design of such flow-through RDCs which have a core flow that
is cold and for the vast majority, non-reacting [143,144] . Average
NOx measurement by this method stayed at approximately 35 ppm
(by volume) across the multiple test cases investigated, forecast-
ing promising RDC NOx emissions characteristics in future config-
urations and fuels. It is also noted here that though the numeri-
cal simulation was two-dimensional and assumed an ideal injec-
tor,  the  estimated  values  of  NOx  are  within  an  agreeable  range
(in terms of ppm) of the experimental measurements. Moving for-
ward, it is essential to attain hydrocarbon-related emissions such
as unburned hydrocarbons (UHC), carbon monoxide (CO) and car-
2 ).  This,  however,  needs  to  be  preceded  by  sta-
bon  dioxide  (CO

ble hydrocarbon fueled RDC operation, which has proven to be a
non-trivial  task.  For  now,  numerical  and  experimental  investiga-
tions  performed  with  methane  appear  to  suggest  that  N
2 O  is  a
bigger component than NO due to the rather short characteristic
times that are representative of an RDC environment ( ∼0.2 ms), as
discussed by Frolov et al. [353] .

10.2. Noise

Similar  to  the  field  of  gaseous  emissions  characterization  of
RDCs, the arena of acoustic emissions produced by RDCs is also
nascent.  To  date,  the  authors  have  not  come  across  an  acoustic
analysis of this device that is performed in an anechoic chamber.
However,  some  studies  have  dealt  with  nominal  measurements
of  the  sound  produced  by  RDCs  [343,354–356] .  Using  a  micro-
phone placed 1 m away, perpendicularly, from the RDC central axis,
Bykovskii et al. determined that the magnitude of sound produced
by their RDC is inversely proportional to the number of rotating
detonation waves in the chamber, with the three-wave mode pro-
ducing about 100 dB, and the two-wave and one-wave mode pro-
ducing 120 dB and 150 dB respectively [355] . By comparing their
acoustic  pressure  trace  with  the  luminosity  time  trace  acquired
from high speed imaging, they were also able to determine that
the  acoustic  sensing  was  able  to  capture  the  different  dynamics
(based  on  frequency)  of  the  RDC,  such  as  the  number  of  waves
in  the  annulus  and  the  onset  period  after  ignition.  Additionally,
by using radial partitions in the combustor, the noise produced in
the same combustor during deflagration was also measured at the
same  flow  rates  to  ensure  a  proper  comparison,  which  resulted
in  the  surprising  finding  that,  in  their  study,  the  rotating  deto-
nation  mode  did  not  exceed  the  sound  produced  by  traditional
deflagrative burning. The highest frequency of the acoustic spec-
trum was also comparable across both the burning modes, with
the caveat that the source of such frequency during deflagrative
burning remained unidentified. A concomitant study in the same
paper also researched the vibration dynamics of RDCs during op-
eration  in  detonation  vs.  deflagration  mode,  and  concluded  that
vibration  sensors  are  also  efficient  in  ascertaining  the  operating
frequency (detonation speed and mode) of RDCs. However, as op-
posed to the noise production, lower number of waves tended to
produce lesser vibration of the combustor. The cause behind this
is  unknown.  All  the  tested  operating  points  were  also  noted  to
exhibit a distinct start-up period (for both detonation and defla-
gration), vibration-wise, after ignition, which had a frequency of
about 8 Hz and amplitude of 430 dB. This is attributed to an “in-
trinsic oscillation” of the products-gathering tank at the end of the
RDC which is posited to produce this oscillation in the accumu-
lated mixture owing to the disturbance (ignition) of the initially

non-combusting  system  from  its  steady,  stable  state.  It  is  worth
noting  here,  in  the  same  vein,  that  the  shape  of  the  amplitude
measured by the vibration sensor during the onset period is very
similar to the impulse response function of an RDC that was ac-
quired by a systems-identification approach mentioned previously
(ignition and onset section). Fig. 44 a shows this decaying wave af-
ter ignition. Fig. 44 b is a representation of the vibration amplitude
during  rotating  detonation  propagation  (trace  1)  compared  with
the luminosity profiles from imaging (trace 2). Fig. 44 cis a snippet
of a trace that shows DDT occurrence inside the RDC, and it can
be seen that there is negligible difference in vibration amplitudes
between the two modes.

This method — of using far-field acoustic signatures to deter-
mine  the  operating  mode  — was  also  used  by  Theuerkauf  et  al.
to  remotely  monitor  the  dynamics  of  their  RDC  which  was  wa-
ter cooled to run for prolonged durations, which is inhospitable to
flush-mounted sensors that are prone to destruction [343] . Thus,
acoustic sensing is useful from the perspective of monitoring RDC
behavior without hindering the internal fluid mechanics and sen-
sor disintegration during prolonged runs, as noted by Frolov et al.
by comparing it with data acquired from ion probe arrays [356] .
Pandiya  et  al.  furthered  acoustic  analysis  of  RDCs  by  using  two
microphones  perpendicular  to  the  RDC  axis  to  attain  azimuthal
recordings of noise [354] . Using these microphones in conjunction
with exit-plane PCB piezoelectric pressure sensors revealed, once
again, that microphones are indeed highly sensitive to not just ob-
taining frequency changes inside the RDC, but also to the mode
changes responsible for it. For instance, both the pressure sensors
and the microphones are exited in-phase during the azimuthally
simultaneous LPD operation and out-of-phase excitation during ro-
tating detonations. Amplitudes of up to 134 dB were observed at
about 1.5 m away (radially) from the RDC exit, depending on the
mode and equivalence ratio of the hydrogen-air mixture that was
tested — this value is in line with the findings of Bykovskii et al.
It is important to note here that both Bykovskii et al. and Pandiya
et al. contend that LPD mode of operation produces higher noise
than RD mode. This was hypothesized by Bykovskii et al. to be due
to the very nature of the axially travelling pressure pulses which
would presumably produce higher exhaust velocities as opposed to
the products from the slanted RD, thereby emitting higher noise
owing  to  the  eighth-power  dependency  that  noise  has  on  flow
velocities [357] . Irrespective, since experimental details about the
RDC  exhaust  flow-field  is  still  lacking,  we  need  more  evidence
to  corroborate  these  claims.  Currently,  it  can  be  contended  that
there is considerable congruence between different groups on RDC
acoustic signature in non-anechoic test facilities. Moving forward,
detailed experiments are required to assess the sound generation
mechanisms in RDCs.

11. Integration effort s

Broadly, three regions of interest have been studied in utiliz-
ing RDCs: gas-turbines, ramjets and rocket engines. Note that this
is by no means a definitive list of all the possible applications of
an  RDC,  but  rather  the  most  researched  ones.  There  have  been
propositions to use RDCs to “de-swirl” the flow-field leaving the
fan  section  of  a  turbofan  engine,  thereby  bypassing  the  need  to
have  an  outlet  guide  vane  (OGV)  [358] .  It  has  also  been  shown
that  RDCs  act  as  excellent  flame-holders  when  housed  within  a
surrounding concentric reactive flow capable of deflagration [359] .
A multi-physics modeling of Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) power
extraction from an RDC, which was exposed to a magnetic field of
1 T, computed an instantaneous power extraction of up to 1.75 kW
per detonation wave at the electrodes, which in turn translates to
an  averaged  power  of  about  10  MW/m 3  at  the  detonation  front
[360] .  This  use  of  Lorentz  force  to  extract  power  from  the  ion-
ized medium produced by the very high temperatures in an RDC
can  be  effectively  used  in  space  thrusters.  In  the  realm  of  gas-
turbine  engines,  the  issue  of  downstream  mating  of  the  turbine
to the RDC has taken a higher precedence to the problems asso-
ciated with compressor-RDC coupling; the latter is opined to be as
significant a problem, if not bigger. Depending on the orientation
of the turbine stator blades, drastically different pressure profiles
are  observed  in  the  combustor  upstream,  suggestive  of  the  pos-
sibility  of  strong  coupling  between  the  two  elements,  owing  to
the marked change in the oblique shock wave reflection charac-
teristics from the solid stator surface. Experimentally, Zhou et al.
[294] record this reflected shock wave from the stator stages to
even routinely exceed half the magnitude of the peak pressure of
the attached oblique shock wave. Stronger reflections are formed
when the oblique shock wave is incident on the stator surface at
angles close to the normal. This result is unsurprising considering
the sensitivity of reflected shock waves to the curvature of and an-
gular incidence on solid surfaces [361] . Bach et al. [169] attempted
to  overcome  these  multiple  factors  by  using  a  symmetric  guide
vane at the exit at a zero angle of inclination, and yet noticed sig-
nificant pressure variations along the entire length of the RDC at-
tributable to the “periodic disruption from the individual vanes”.
Hence, while a choked guide vane section can, essentially, produce
the same effects seen in a choked nozzle RDC [270] , it also appears
to induce additional issues predicated on the actual vane’s prop-

erties. On a similar note, it is prudent to recall the issue of the
RDC exhausts flow-field, which as discussed earlier in Section 2 ,
is composed of both subsonic and supersonic flows that is highly
dependent on the operating condition. This presents a particularly
daunting challenge with regards to turbine blade selection since
vast degrees of flow separation could be caused depending on the
nature of the flow and the direction of the wave. Therefore, an as-
sumption  of  a  completely  supersonic  inlet  flow  into  the  turbine
section, like the one made by Sousa et al. [8] to arrive at a 5% ef-
ficiency increase due to pressure gain combustion might not accu-
rately represent the actual physics of the complex interaction. On a
more systems-level approach, Naples et al. [13] and Kindracki have
tested an RDC integrated to an open-loop gas-turbine setting — see
Fig. 45 a and b respectively. Both the studies estimate higher ben-
efits brought by detonative combustion in their respective RDCs,
with Naples et al. claiming an increased turbine factor — defined
as the comparison of the total fuel energy input to the system to
the energy extracted by the turbines — with RDCs, as opposed to
deflagrative combustors, and Wolanksi [12] ascertaining a reduced
SFC — by 5% — when RDCs were integrated into their unoptimized
GTD-350 helicopter engine. These results are promising consider-
ing that both these studies were performed without first optimiz-
ing the coupling between the combustor and the associated sub-
systems, which as reviewed above is significant and sensitive to a
wide array of variables.

With regard to ramjet engines, both computational [245,362–
364]  and  experimental  [26 6,267,365,36 6]  studies  have  been  per-
formed  that  have successfully  demonstrated  the  feasibility of  an
anchored rotating detonation wave in a supersonic incoming flow.
Frolov et al. [266,267,365] record specific impulse of up to 3300 s
by running their modified rotating detonation ramjet facility (see
Fig. 46 a) at a variety of conditions ranging from freestream Mach
number  of  5  to  8  and  a  stagnation  temperature  of  even  up  to
1500 K.  Dubrovskii  et  al.  [245,362]  performed  simulations  (see
Fig.  46 b)  of  the  experimentally  tested  configuration  and  suggest
that  the  high  frequency  azimuthal  propagation  of  rotating  deto-
nations tend to be highly beneficial for turbulence-based molec-
ular mixing and reactants jet break-ups in rather short distances,
which is of paramount requirement for ramjets. In a separate en-
deavor, Liu et al. [366] also demonstrate sustained rotating detona-
tions in their ramjet facility utilizing hydrogen-air and ethylene-air
mixtures. These results indicate that it is possible to make use of

rotating detonation wave dynamics to effect a prospective increase
in ramjet thermodynamic efficiency. Schwer et al. [363,364] also
provide  strong  support  for  this  possibility  through  their  simula-
tions  which  produced  a  stable  rotating  detonation  wave  at  su-
personic inlet Mach numbers. Thus, the claim of rotating detona-
tions becoming oblique detonation waves at injection speeds that
are closer to or higher than the wave propagation speed [90] can
be refuted. It should, however, be noted that strong instantaneous
pressure gradients are observed in the intake duct of such devices
due to the backpressurizing effect of the rotating waves [363] . Fu-
ture research is expected to quantify and attain design guidelines
on  modifying  the  current  inlet  designs  of  ramjets  to  allow  for
stable operation with detonation waves in the combustor down-
stream; unstarting could be expected to be an area of concern in
actual ramjets operating with RDC.

RDC-integrated rocket engines could be argued to be the most
mechanically  simplistic  implementation  of  the  combustor.  How-
ever, the combustion chamber of rocket engines tend to operate
at considerably higher pressure than that of gas-turbine or ram-

jet engines. In this regard, considering the sensitivity of detona-
tions to ignition pressure and temperature, one should expect this
rendering of RDC-integrated system to perhaps be the most com-
plex, physico-chemically. The topics covered above holds true for
all facets of RDC-powered rocket engines, and will not be delib-
erated again here. Barring the combustion chamber, the nozzle is
the most important part of a rocket engine. There have been few
works that have dealt with the issue of nozzle optimization for the
highly  unsteady  flow-field  produced  by  an  RDC.  When  the  noz-
zle does not have a throat, i.e. when it is unchoked, the oblique
shock wave attached to the detonation front extends all the way to
the nozzle aft-end, and causes significant changes to the flow-field
[253] , and by extension, thrust charactersistics. Shown in Fig. 47 a
are the temperature contours for an unchoked aerospike nozzle af-
ter an RDC, showing a normal shock (along the same azimuth as
the oblique shock front) formed by the nozzle spike tip due to the
underexpanded nature of the unchoked flow, which in turn lends
itself to the possibility of a barrel shock structure that could re-
volve at the frequency of the detonation wave. As pointed out ear-

Government).

lier (in Section 7 ), mass flow choking at the throat tends to remove
most of the unsteadiness [40,367] . As witnessed in Fig. 47 b, there
are still weak shock waves that are formed by the nozzle (trun-
cated plug) surface after the throat constriction due to the sud-
den flow expansion after the throat. For low nozzle pressure ratios,
Schwer et al. [368] argue that a truncated aerospike is sufficient
to provide the required degree of expansion after an RDC. While
this  is  posited  to  save  considerable  dry  weight,  an  unoptimized
truncation is estimated to produce strong recirculation zones (see
Fig.  47 c)  by  the  flat  surface  thereby  causing  commendable  base
drag across the nozzle. It is, once again, important to bear in mind
that there are vast regions of the operating regime that tend to
produce highly unstable RDC operation ( Section 8 ) when the back-
pressure exerted on the combustor is too high. Hence, an accept-
able operation can only be realized by optimizing the throat while
bearing in mind the effect it produces on the upstream combus-
tion  chamber  (reduced  fill  height,  strong  reflected  shock  waves,
LPD mode, etc.). Having said that, it has been shown by multiple
studies that a convergent-divergent nozzle (as opposed to constant
area, diverging, etc.) is best suited for extracting the highest thrust
performance from RDCs [14,138,250,257,369] .

12. Challenges and future prospects

Rotating detonations have been reported and observed for more
than five decades now. Yet, the fundamental understanding of this
class of detonation phenomenon has been rather curtailed. This is,
although, unsurprising considering the complexity of the processes
that constitute detonation waves, which at its crux [21] has the
last unsolved problem (arguably) of classical physics [370] : turbu-
lence. On another note, from the discussions above, it appears rea-
sonable to attribute some of the widely dreaded high frequency
combustion  instability  mechanisms  to  detonation  dynamics.  The
failure to consider this possibility more readily appears to origi-
nate in the shortcomings of directly using the current theory on
detonation  propagation  in  stationary  mixtures  to  rotating  deto-
nation waves, which by construct move in a nonstationary reac-
tive medium. In this regard, one could comment that an upgrade
is required in terms of adapting fundamental gaseous detonation
physics  theory  to  better  match  rotating  detonations;  this  could
most certainly resolve some of the issues pertaining to velocity and
pressure deficits from C-J and ZND theory. It should be expected
that issues such as area divergence, stable vs. unstable detonation
propagation (based on induction length and cellular instability, re-
spectively) and detonation decoupling, etc. [21] will manifest in ro-
tating detonations as well, albeit with some difference on account
of the rotary dynamics and non-stationary upstream flow. The na-
ture of pollutants emissions from detonative action also appears to
be a nascent field, with barely a handful of approaches trying to
model it [349,351] . These are issues of fundamental nature that,
in the authors’ opinion, is required to form a solid foundation to
support this new combustor architecture. Considering the sensitiv-
ity of the most problematic of pollutants, NOx, on the temperature
and the time of residence at the temperature, it is all the more
imperative to have a detonation theory tailored to the peculiarities
of an RDC environment so that any endeavor on emissions mod-
elling  in  RDC  may  be  remotely  successful.  Along  the  same  line,
it is known that detonation propagation along a curved boundary
might induce regions of lower temperature within the wave due
to products divergence, thereby effectively simulating a patholog-
ical (weak) detonation, which has lower pressure and higher ve-
locity than the ideal C-J predictions [52,127] . This particular issue
of curvature on rotating detonation wave chemistry and propaga-
tion is yet to be investigated, and is expected to have a signifi-
cant consequence on its propagation and characteristics, including
pollutant formation. A representative normal detonation velocity-

Fig. 48.  The dependency of normal detonation velocity (D n ) on the curvature of
the leading shock front ( κ). The D n -t curve is composed of three segments and two
turning points. The higher point causes detonation extinction due to excessive cur-
vature, whereas the lower one encourages ignition from the isobaric sound speed.
The top segment is the most important once relating to stable detonation propaga-
tion, whereas the middle segment is unstable since detonation acceleration tends
to increase curvature. The lowest segment has very weak detonation propagation at
near-sonic speeds (Reprinted from Ref. [127] with permission from Elsevier).

curvature dependence is shown in Fig. 48 , depicting the possibility
of significant wave deficits with increasing shock front curvature.
We should consider the possibility that some manifestations of ro-
tating detonation waves may actually be weak detonations, unless
it has been comprehensively proven otherwise. The fact that tan-
gential wave speeds of almost the same magnitude as the ideal C-J
speed has been recorded in hollow RDCs with ethylene-air mix-
tures [83] — the actual wave speed will be notably higher consid-
ering its angular orientation with the wall and the injection re-
actants’ velocity — lends credence to this line of questioning. In
short, current detonation theory needs to be expanded to account
for the peculiarities of rotating detonation wave physics, and an
in-whole application of the former should be expected to only pro-
duce a partial description of the latter.

Second, the other part of the current shortcomings lie in the
very  nature  of  the  system  under  consideration,  the  essence  of
which is as follows: to attain the highest possible thermodynamic
efficiency through detonative combustion, which usually accompa-
nies with it large pressure and temperature peaks along with the
associated  strong  sensitivity  of  the  mixture  to  these  peaks.  This
needs to be performed without letting these exorbitant pressure
dynamics  completely  alter  the  inlet  and  outlet  conditions  from
the cold-flow state so as to make the system almost unrecogniz-
able by the time it overcomes the transient operation stage. De-
spite this, numerical simulations (as discussed above) have been
remarkable in their accuracy in determining both qualitatively and
quantitatively, the rotating detonation wave structure. While this
is highly promising, it is clear that there are indeed notable limi-
tations, which include the lack of simulations or models that are
able  to  get  the  same  type  of  velocity  and  pressure  deficits  that
are noted in experiments. As reviewed above, simulations have so
far yet to “properly” model co-rotating waves, since the individual
simulated waves do not incur the same type of increased velocity
deficits from multiplicity, as observed in experimental works. This
might be an artifact of applying the classical detonation theories
to rotating detonation wave dynamics, which are different enough
to  warrant  a  separate  first-principles  approach  to  deal  with  the
transverse upstream reactants injection. The fact that most simu-
lations pertaining to RDCs do not model the individual detonation
cells separately, but rather utilize a “zoomed out” ZND theory-type
approach might also contribute to the mismatch between simula-
tions and experiments. Tsuboi et al. note this effect to be a result
of a lesser than optimal grid resolution; in their study increasing
the resolution in the circumferential direction tended to produce
the well-known diamond shaped soot foil record [371] . The deto-
nation wave composed of three cells transversely arranged along

with their triple points (TP) is shown in Fig. 49 a, while Fig. 49 b
gives the computational soot foil record obtained from such a high
resolution, three-dimensional numerical study. While it is acceded
that this simplification is necessary to model this complex com-
bustor, it is beneficial to bear in mind the assumptions made in
attaining  such  representations.  It  is  also  important  to  note  that
longitudinal pulsed detonation, which assumes a significant por-
tion of an RDC’s operating regime when backpressurized — which
will be the device’s actual operating condition across most systems
such as rocket or gas-turbine engines and afterburners — has not
yet been simulated numerically. Since most of the current simu-
lations use an ideal premixed injector, unburdened by the tempo-
ral (flow recovery timing) and spatial impacts (poor mixing) im-
parted  by  the  detonation  wave  on  the  injector  elements,  a  vast
swath of RDC operating modes might not be simulated. To arrive at
a more accurate picture, future undertakings must incorporate not
only the actual combustor, but also the actual upstream and down-
stream conditions, in a manner similar to the effort of Yellapantula
et al. [372] , who recently modeled an entire RDC system including
the plenums, the pre-detonator igniting tube, and the individual
non-premixed injectors in a three-dimensional, reactive, unsteady
solver. To surmise, the conventional methodology of delineating a
problem into a smaller, more malleable subset might render some
of the RDC  physics obscured from recording and subsequent in-
terpretation.  This  claim  is  argued  to  hold  true  for  experimental
methodologies as well. For instance, while “unwrapped RDCs” (lin-
ear structures supposed to imitate one lap of a rotating detonation
wave [224] ) might lend themselves to simplicity in visualization
they inherently lack the concavity of the outer wall, which signif-
icantly alters the strength of the detonation wave. On the other
hand,  detonation  wave  propagation  in  stand-alone  curved  chan-
nels, while simulative of the geometric specifics of an actual RDC,
has a premixed stationary upstream reactant mixture which is con-
trary to the scenario in an RDC. As a result, the assumptions made
to attain a representative system might intrinsically skew the inter-
pretation of RDC behavior. The authors contend that a problem of
this complexity and magnitude compels solutions of similar ampli-
tude. The recent works of Levin et al. [156] , who simulated an RDC
using billions of cells in a supercomputer, and Codoni et al. [261] ,
who experimentally captured both mid-infrared and OH ∗ chemi-
luminescence spectrum of rotating detonations simultaneously ap-
pear to head in the right direction.

The third and final part of the current section that the authors
wish to bring attention to, deals with the main motivation behind

Fig. 50.  Manifestation of periodic flow unsteadiness as a body force potential on a
fluid element as it moves through time and space (Reprinted from Ref. [376] with
permission of American Society of Mechanical Engineers).

RDC: pressure (stagnation) gain combustion. It is critical to under-
stand that pressure gain is dependent not merely on the detona-
tion wave by itself; but of the unsteadiness caused in the flow-field
by the wave. As shown and argued by Wintenberger and Sheperd
[373] , if a detonation wave were to be made stationary by attach-
ing it to a supersonic intake (as is the case of an oblique deto-
nation wave engine: ODWE [374] ) it would actually produce lower
efficiency than a comparable ramjet engine owing to the significant
stagnation pressure loss caused by the strong standing shock wave.
As a corollary, there have been other PGC devices, such as pulse-
jet combustors [317,375] , that have been proposed to produce an
increase in stagnation pressure not by virtue of detonations (there
aren’t any), but by having an unsteady flow inside the device. Bor-
rowing from the results from turbomachinery (stagnation pressure
increases  across  a  compressor  stage),  Hodson  et  al.  [376]  show
that the stagnation pressure of a fluid increases due to the static
pressure, which “has been shown to play the same role as does
a time-dependent body force potential in particle mechanics”, i.e.
“when the unsteadiness is due to a nonuniformity that translates
at a constant speed, as in a turbomachine, an interpretation can
be made in terms of a local power input per unit mass to a fluid
particle” (see  a  representation  in  Fig.  50 ).  With  regards  to  RDC,
this increase in stagnation pressure has been estimated and con-
firmed numerically [15,243] . Experimentally, however, there have
not yet been any study that has shown this to be the case, rig-
orously, directly . A main detriment towards this goal is the very
strongly time-dependent, high temperature, strongly swirling and
angular flow-field that has not lent itself to direct measurements
of stagnation pressure. As a result, the scientific community is un-

sure at present as to the methodology to follow to attain it, as wit-
nessed by the words of Kaemming and Paxson [377] , who say, “all
of these PGC devices are unsteady and, as such, a reasonable and
conclusive validation of their promised pressure gain is elusive”,
and that “it is not obvious that a simple average of exit total pres-
sure is a meaningful measure of available total pressure”. Hence,
barring  a  revolutionary  breakthrough  in  sensing  technologies,  a
pragmatic approach on this predicament should instead focus on
quantifying pressure gain by indirect means. Fotia et al. [14] show-
case one such method to infer an increase in stagnation pressure
by utilizing a choked RDC and applying the mass flow parameter
(MFP) at the nozzle throat section (Mach number of unity). This
method, unfortunately, cannot be used when the RDC exit is not
geometrically choked. Additionally, it is desirable to know the ex-
act change in performance brought about by the addition of a noz-
zle  for  component  selection.  In  this  regard,  the  efforts  of  Frolov
et al. [11,176] appear enticing. They do not try to ascertain stagna-
tion pressures, but rather directly contrast a detonative combustor
to a comparable (in ignition pressure, size and mass flow rates)
deflagrative one. The method, though simplistic at first glance, car-
ries a practical benefit of showing a direct improvement in per-
formance brought about by RDCs over conventional combustors. A
case in point is the successful demonstration of an RDC powered
by natural gas and oxygen, which produced a specific impulse of
270 s at a mean combustor pressure of 32 atm [176] . This perfor-
mance, in terms of specific impulse, is noted to be about the same
as that of the widely used RD 170-A engine, but at a mean cham-
ber pressure of 61 atm, leading to the conclusion that an RDC is
more energy efficient since it produces the same impulse at half
the  chamber  pressure,  which  suggests  a  prospective  decrease  in
turbopump unit sizes. It is the opinion of the authors that more
such novel methodologies need to be investigated in the next few
years before the field settles on a well-accepted “benchmark” to
quantify RDC performance.

13. Concluding remarks

The  benefits  of  RDCs  in  increasing  the  thermal  efficiency  of
rocket engines and gas-turbine combustors appear to no longer be
a  promise  based  solely  on  theoretical  models.  Multiple  research
groups  have  provided  experimental  evidence  that  increased  effi-
ciency is realizable through RDCs (pressure gain, though, has not
been measured directly). While, undoubtedly, there are numerous
challenges  to  overcome,  it  is  important  at  this  juncture  for  en-
gine manufacturers and policy makers  to acknowledge the  step-
change performance increase offered by this class of combustors,
so they can subsequently invest in it. Though many green energy
prospects  have  been  proposed  to  overcome  the  challenges  per-
taining to emissions and energy efficiency as humanity refocuses
its  attention  towards  the  coming  decades,  the  fact  remains  that
the more traditional power generation and propulsion systems like
gas-turbines and rocket engines are a necessity to support the de-
manding missions of the present and future. Cases in point are the
SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy rocket engines and GE’s Harriet and 9X gas-
turbine  engines.  It  is  emphasized  that  about  10%  of  the  energy
consumed  in  the  US  is  by  gas-turbines  (2.5%  from  aviation  and
6.9% from power generation). A 1% improvement in the thermody-
namic efficiency of these devices would be tantamount to remov-
ing 1,360,0 0 0 cars off the roads, as pointed out by Paxson [378] . It
is thus self-evident that, moving forward, rotating detonation com-
bustors will need to occupy a significant portion of the effort s re-
lated to reducing emissions and increasing systems efficiency.

On the other hand, in the authors’ opinion, an equally impor-
tant take-away from the present review is that the modes of op-

eration of RDCs share numerous striking similarities with combus-
tion instabilities observed in rocket engines, both qualitatively and
quantitatively. These overlaps, listed and discussed above, are one
too many to be a result of mere coincidence. Not surprisingly, the
field  of  RDCs  has  started  “looking  back” into  the  issue  of  high
and low frequency instabilities that have plagued many a rocket
engine development program. While some of the programs were
able to overcome these crippling instabilities, which usually tend
to destroy engines within seconds, some have not been as fortu-
nate  [88] .  In  this  regard,  the  authors  contend  that  research  into
RDCs  has  a  two-pronged  merit:  one  is  its  offer  of  increased  ef-
ficiency,  and  the  other  is  the  treatment  of  combustion  instabil-
ities  that  plague  conventional  engines  using  detonation  physics.
Needless  to  say,  the  latter  should  be  construed  to  be  as  critical
as the former considering the lack of first-principles understanding
of why, when and how the crippling instabilities form. Though the
thrust in this paper has been on establishing the overlaps in RDC
mechanics and rocket engine physics, it is emphasized that many
other combustion systems (afterburners, premixed burner, etc.) are
also susceptible to very similar destructive phenomena [379] . The
issue of demarcating these off-design behaviors based on an en-
gine type is one stemming from the human need for classification
and not of an inherent difference in physico-chemical processes oc-
curring therein. In this vein, studying RDCs is theorized to have a
tremendous  impact  on  understanding  the  physics  of  deflagrative
combustors due to the essence of what an RDC is: a hollow or an-
nular geometry that is fed reactants continuously, which at certain
conditions, tends to produce strong, shock-fronted, high-frequency,
combustion-coupled oscillations that produce notably higher heat
transfer, erosion rates and thrust compared to normal operation.
Additionally, as seen by the similarities between rotating detona-
tions  and  spinning  detonations  (discussed  above  in  Section  1.1 ),
one  should  view  the  tertiary  benefit  of  RDCs  to  be  its  prospec-
tive application in answering some of the many unknowns in fun-
damental detonation physics. This, once again, is important in the
engineering-sense in order to avoid explosions in industries where
reactive mixtures need to be moved in tubes or stored in tanks;
understanding the onset of spinning detonations in tubes is instru-
mental in avoiding unnecessary explosions.

Finally, it should be agreed that some of the shortfalls that have
led  to  inaccurate  descriptions  of  the  observed  RDC-related  phe-
nomena are due to the lack of appropriate sensing techniques. For
instance, the current need of the hour is to have a high-frequency
pressure sensor that does not degrade within a second of being
exposed to the RDC environment. To measure the operation of a
pressure  gain  combustion  system,  this  is  a  rather  critical  short-
coming.  The  same  issue  holds  true  for  high-frequency  heat  flux
sensors  as  well,  which  have  been  known  to  disintegrate  within
a  second.  Finally,  current  technology  also  appears  to  be  insuffi-
cient in clearly visualizing the inherently three-dimensional phe-
nomenon of gaseous detonations. It is apparent that the advance-
ment  and  subsequent  application  of  RDCs  require  a  commensu-
rate  development  in  the  field  of  fluid  and  combustion  dynamic
instrumentation.  The  last  point  of  required  future  focus  accord-
ing to the current authors is the need to develop materials and
structures that can withstand the extreme heat, pressure and fre-
quency loading produced during RDC operation. If structural lim-
itations  weren’t  the  primary  bottleneck  faced  by  rocket  engines
during HFI, it would be a reasonable assumption that rocket en-
gine researchers would have preferred to operate in this mode that
produces higher efficiency and thrust. Unfortunately, such an oper-
ation has mostly been linked with catastrophic structural failures
after  a  finite  time.  RDC  implementation,  thus,  requires  heighted
concentration on these elements as well, along with a focus on ac-
tive and/or passive cooling systems.
