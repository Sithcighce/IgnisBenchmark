    "question_text": "Calculate the theoretical maximum power density for an AAEMFC operating at 60°C with humidified H₂ and O₂, given an open-circuit voltage of 1.23 V. Explain the fundamental thermodynamic basis for this calculation, including the relationship between Gibbs free energy, reversible potential, and maximum theoretical power density. Then describe how activation, ohmic, and mass transport overpotentials reduce the actual power output, citing specific examples from the provided paper.",
    "standard_answer": "The theoretical maximum power density calculation begins with the thermodynamic maximum work principle. For the overall reaction H₂ + 1/2O₂ → H₂O, the maximum electrical work equals the negative Gibbs free energy change: W_max = -ΔG. The reversible cell voltage is E_rev = -ΔG/(nF), where n = 2 electrons transferred and F = 96485 C/mol. Using the provided E_OCV = 1.23 V as the thermodynamic reversible potential, the maximum theoretical power density occurs at half the reversible voltage (0.615 V) due to the polarization curve characteristics. At this point, P_max = (E_rev/2) × (i_max), where i_max is the current density corresponding to this voltage. However, in practice, 'the theoretical cell voltage cannot be realized due to a series of irreversible losses, such as overpotentials caused by activation, ohmic, and mass-transport processes.' Activation overpotential arises from slow electrode kinetics, particularly at the cathode for oxygen reduction. Ohmic overpotential results from resistance to ion transport in the AAEM and electron conduction. Mass transport overpotential occurs at high currents when reactant diffusion limits reaction rates. The paper provides specific performance examples, noting that 'the peak power density of 400 mW cm⁻² in an AAEMFC fabricated with Pd (1.5 mg cm⁻²) as anode electrocatalyst and Ag (3 mg cm⁻²) as cathode electrocatalyst' represents actual performance far below theoretical maximum due to these cumulative losses. The actual power density P_actual = i × (E_OCV - η_act - η_ohm - η_conc), where optimization involves enhancing catalyst activity, membrane conductivity, and electrode structure to minimize these losses.",
