The Co-Optimization of Fuels and Engines (Co-Optima) initiative from the US Department of Energy aims 
to co-develop fuels and engines in an effort to maximize energy eﬃciency and the utilization of renew- 
able fuels. Many of these renewable fuel options have fuel chemistries that are different from those of 
petroleum-derived fuels. Because practical market fuels need to meet speciﬁc fuel-property requirements, 
a chemistry-agnostic approach to assessing the potential beneﬁts of candidate fuels was developed using 
the Central Fuel Property Hypothesis (CFPH). The CFPH states that fuel properties are predictive of the 
performance of the fuel, regardless of the fuel’s chemical composition. In order to use this hypothesis 
to assess the potential of fuel candidates to increase eﬃciency in spark-ignition (SI) engines, the indi- 
vidual contributions towards eﬃciency potential in an optimized engine must be quantiﬁed in a way 
that allows the individual fuel properties to be traded off for one another. This review article begins by 
providing an overview of the historical linkages between fuel properties and engine eﬃciency, including 
the two dominant pathways currently being used by vehicle manufacturers to reduce fuel consumption. 
Then, a thermodynamic-based assessment to quantify how six individual fuel properties can affect eﬃ- 
ciency in SI engines is performed: research octane number, octane sensitivity, latent heat of vaporization, 
laminar ﬂame speed, particulate matter index, and catalyst light-off temperature. The relative effects of 
each of these fuel properties is combined into a uniﬁed merit function that is capable of assessing the 
fuel property-based eﬃciency potential of fuels with conventional and unconventional compositions.

greatly inﬂuenced the history and coevolution of fuels and engines, 
not only in the “fuel improvement age” but also throughout the 
twentieth century. Beginning in the late 1910s through the 1930s, 
researchers identiﬁed engine and fuel relationships between knock, 
compression ratio, performance, and eﬃciency [5] . 

Despite concerns about toxicity [6–9] , TEL became an econom- 
ically viable pathway to increase AKI, and allow corresponding in- 
creases in r c ,  as shown in Fig. 1 . However, the toxicity concerns 
did limit its concentration, to initially 3.17 g-Pb/gal in 1925 [6] , fol- 
lowed  by  an  increase  in  1959  to  4.23 g-Pb/gal  [10] .  Reﬁning  ad- 
vancements provided an additional path to increased AKI, includ- 
ing continuous process vacuum distillation, improved thermal re- 
forming  in  the  late  1920s  and  1930s,  catalytic  cracking  during 
World War II, and platinum reforming in the 1950s [11] . These fac- 
tors allowed the AKI of both regular and premium grade gasoline 
to increase by more than 9 points from 1953 to 1970. 

Simultaneous with AKI increases in the 1950s and 1960s, the 
real  price  of  gasoline  decreased  (i.e.,  adjusted  for  inﬂation)  [1] , 
resulting  in  the  “Power  Wars” age  ( Fig.  1 )  where  the  ﬂeet  av- 
erage  horsepower  doubled  between  1953  and  1969  with  virtu- 
ally  no  increase  in  vehicle  weight  (127 vs.  284  HP  and  3850 vs. 
3879 lb, respectively). While improvements in AKI enabled power 
increases  through  higher  r c ,  there  were  also  other  contributing 
factors. Speciﬁcally, because there were no criteria emission stan- 
dards at that time, increasing power through fuel enrichment was 
widespread. Fuel enrichment is when there is more fuel than can 
be burned to completion with the amount of air present in the 
combustion chamber, and while this increases power, it also re- 
duces fuel economy and increases emissions of unburned hydro- 
carbons (HCs) and carbon monoxide (CO). Until oxygenated com- 
pounds  were  added  to  fuel  at  appreciable  levels  starting  in  the 
late 1990s and early 20 0 0s, the stoichiometric mass air-fuel ratio 
(AFR) for gasoline was approximately 14.5. The ﬂeet-average AFR 
decreased from approximately 15:1 in 1955 to approximately13:1 
by  1961  and  persisted  at  approximately  13:1  through  1965  [12] . 
The combined trajectories of these effects are presented in Fig. 2 . 

The  rapid  advances  in  performance  during  the  late  1950s 
through the 1960s (“power wars age” in Fig. 1 ), were quickly halted 
by emissions regulations resulting from urban air quality concerns 
and fuel economy regulations resulting from geopolitically-caused 
fuel shortages in the 1970s. In 1970, the US Congress passed the 
Clean Air Act, which included the ﬁrst national tailpipe emissions 
standard that regulated tailpipe emissions of CO, volatile organic 
compounds (VOCs), and oxides of nitrogen (NO x ), and went into 
full effect by 1975. 

In order to implement the emission standards of the Clean Air 
Act, the composition of the fuel had to be changed so that the ex- 
haust was compatible with the emerging catalytic aftertreatment 
technologies. Speciﬁcally, beyond the widespread contamination of 
the environment with lead, which had known negative health ef- 
fects  [13–19] ,  TEL  tended  to  cause  deposit  formation  inside  the 
combustion chamber. In order to prevent deposits, halogenate anti- 
deposit fuel additives such as dichloroethane and dibromoethane 
were  developed  in  the  1920s  and  added  to  gasoline  to  prevent 
metal deposits from rapidly forming on combustion chamber sur- 
faces  [ 16 , 20 , 21 ].  Initially  these  anti-deposit  additives  were  not  a 
technical concern, but it was found that they poisoned catalysts 
and  prevented  compliance  with  the  Clean  Air  Act.  Thus,  to  en- 
able catalyst use in 1975, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA) deﬁned the associated fuel lead phasedown process in 1973 
[22] , ruling that unleaded gasoline must be offered by all point-of- 
sale vendors by July 1974 [22] . Despite improved reﬁning technolo- 
gies, removing the TEL from gasoline caused the AKI to decrease by 
approximately 2 points from 90 AKI in 1970 to 88 AKI in 1974, as 
seen in Fig. 1 .

1. Eﬃciency trends in spark ignition engines 

1.1. Historical trends in spark ignition engines (190 0–20 0 0) 

The composition and properties of fuel for spark ignition (SI) 
engines have historically been affected by many factors dating to 
the invention of the SI engine. Engine performance has only been 
one of the factors, while others are related to fuel production re- 
sources and technology, engine technology, regulations, and soci- 
etal acceptance. Most of this review article focuses on the ways in 
which fuel affects engine performance and eﬃciency, but this sec- 
tion includes discussion of the larger societal and regulatory im- 
pacts for context. 

Recently, Splitter et al. [1] provided an in-depth review of the 
coevolution of SI engines and fuels that relied on the antiknock 
index (AKI) as the primary performance metric of the fuel. In a re- 
view of knocking combustion, Wang et al. [2] describe knock as the 
noise associated with autoignition of a portion of the fuel-air mix- 
ture ahead of the propagating ﬂame front, and add that knock is 
an inherent problem that plagues SI engines. The AKI is intended 
to be a metric of knock resistance, and is the average of the re- 
search octane number (RON, ASTM D2699 [3] ) and motor octane 
number (MON, ASTM D2700 [4] ), which are standardized tests un- 
der two different engine operating conditions. In general, the more 
resistant a fuel is to autoignition or knock, the more eﬃcient an 
SI engine can be. Section 3 provides a more detailed analysis of 
the  relationship  between  knock  resistance  and  engine  eﬃciency, 
including the shortcomings of the RON, MON, and AKI metrics, as 
well as other fuel properties that affect knock. However, from a 
historical perspective on the evolution of fuel quality, we will rely 
on the analysis from Splitter et al. [1] , which used AKI. 

In an effort to better understand the historical trends, Splitter et 
al. [1] identiﬁed developments and segmented the history of fuels 
into ﬁnite time frames or “ages,” which are bounded by the onset 
of, or changes to, technical, societal, and regulatory factors. These 
ages are indicated in Fig. 1 , which also illustrates the average en- 
gine compression ratio ( r c ) of all vehicles sold on an annual basis, 
the average AKI of regular-grade gasoline, and the concentration of 
tetraethyl lead (TEL), a fuel additive that was used to increase the 
AKI of gasoline in the United States from the 1920s until the late 
1980s. 

The initial age pointed out in Splitter et al. [1] consisted of en- 
gine and fuel coevolution that stemmed from fuel improvements. 
Speciﬁcally, improvements to reﬁning and fuel additives (e.g., TEL)

Initially, emission standards were met with the use of an ox- 
idation catalyst to treat CO and VOC emissions, and by reducing 
NO x emissions through in-cylinder methods [23] . The widespread 
methods  to  reduce  NO x  emissions  in-cylinder  were  to  reduce  r c 
and to introduce exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) [ 23 , 24 ]. The re- 
duced r c to comply with NO x emission standards also had the ef- 
fect  of  masking  the  reduced  performance  of  the  lower  AKI  un- 
leaded  fuel  [ 11 , 21 , 22 , 25–27 ].  To  meet  the  more  stringent  NOx 
emission standards in 1981, three-way catalysts (TWCs) were de- 
veloped and deployed, simultaneously reducing NO x while oxidiz- 
ing  CO  and  VOC  emissions  [27] .  These  effort s  proved  successful 
at reducing emissions and improving air quality, including reduc- 
ing  NOx  emissions  by  a  factor  of  4  by  1981  relative  to  a  pre- 
regulations vehicle, from 4 g/mi NO x to 1.0 g/mi [ 23 , 27 ]. However, 
reducing r c to comply with NO x emission standards decreased the 
maximum theoretical and achievable eﬃciency of the engine [28] . 
Fig. 2 shows that the fuel economy of vehicles in the mid-1960s 
was higher than that of vehicles in the early 1970s. 

Motivated  by  fuel  supply  volatility  in  the  1970s,  the  United 
States  passed  the  Energy  Policy  Conservation  Act  of  1975  [29] , 
which among other things, imposed fuel economy standards to re- 
duce fuel consumption. The average fuel economy standards were 
15,  19,  and  20  mpg  for  the  model  years  1978,  1979,  and  1980, 
respectively,  and  an  eventual  requirement  of  27.5  mpg  for  1985 
[29]  that  automakers  met  primarily  through  sharp  reductions  in 
vehicle weight—nearly 20%—from 1976 to 1980. Further fuel econ- 
omy improvements, as well as engine performance improvements 
were necessary, but unlike in the fuel improvement and power war 
ages, AKI of the gasoline was not increasing, as shown in Fig. 1 , and 
therefore could not be used as a basis for engine improvements. 

Further engine improvements were enabled during the digital 
age, which, as shown in Fig. 1 , effectively enabled r c to be decou- 
pled from AKI. The digital age accelerated advances in engine de- 
sign through computer-aided simulations, and through electronic 
controls combined with low-cost sensors and computing. On-board 
controls  included  knock  sensors  [30]  coupled  with  active  spark 
control [31] to mitigate knock, and improved air-fuel-ratio control 
[32–34] to enable higher catalyst conversion eﬃciency at stoichio- 
metric operation [ 23 , 35 , 36 ]. Both computational design tools and 
on-vehicle controls became critical to building vehicles that com- 
plied  with  increasingly  stringent  exhaust  tailpipe  emissions  lim- 
its  and  fuel  economy  standards  [23] .  As  a  result,  in  the  1980s 

and  1990s it  was possible to  increase r c  and performance with- 
out changes to fuel AKI, thereby increasing both performance and 
eﬃciency. This allowed vehicle power and acceleration to be in- 
creased an average of 4% every year from 1980 to 2004 without 
improvements in AKI [37] . 

1.2. Recent trends in SI engines (20 0 0–Present) 

The  2018  EPA  Automotive  Trends  Report  provides  recent  fuel 
economy data [38] and, as shown in Fig. 3 , vehicle fuel economy 
has been increasing sharply since 2005. This recent fuel economy 
increase comes after a period of fuel economy decrease between 
1986 to 2005, likely due to several circumstances. The oil glut of 
the mid 1980’s resulted in a return to very inexpensive gasoline 
after the price shocks of the 1970’s. During the Reagan Administra- 
tion in 1986, the corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards 
enacted  in  1975  were  frozen  at  26.0  mpg  for  cars  and  19.5  for 
trucks, instead of the 27.5 mpg and 20.0 mpg, respectively as des- 
ignated in the Clean Air Act [39] . Under the George H. W. Bush Ad- 
ministration in 1989, the standards returned to 27.5 mpg and 20.0 
mpg, but attempts to raise them further were thwarted through 
the  Bush  Administration  and  the  Clinton  Administration  [39] .  At 
the same time, consumer preference was shifting markedly from 
small cars to heavier light trucks and SUVs, thus resulting in an 
overall decrease in real-world fuel economy [39] . Safety concerns 
also led to increases in vehicle weight as body reinforcements and 
other safety systems added to the weight of the vehicles. In 20 0 0, 
late  in  the  Clinton  Administration,  Congress  lifted  the  freeze  on 
fuel economy that had been in place since 1989, setting the stage 
for future CAFE increases. This occurred during the George W. Bush 
Administration  when  Congress  passed  the  Energy  Independence 
and Security Act (EISA) which increased CAFE as a ﬂeet-wide av- 
erage for all vehicles to 35 mpg by 2020, and then was increased 
further during the Obama Administration. Interestingly, while vehi- 
cle weight has been largely level since 2005, horsepower has con- 
tinued to increase as fuel economy has improved. 

The increase in vehicle fuel economy is partly attributable to 
engine  technologies  and  partly  attributable  to  non-engine  tech- 
nologies. Non-engine technologies include advancements in trans- 
missions  [40]  that  allow  the  engine  to  be  operated  at  higher- 
eﬃciency operating conditions throughout a drive cycle [41] , ad- 
vancements in the light weighting of vehicles [42] , and the energy

recovered through regenerative braking in hybrid electric power- 
trains [43] . Those technologies are very important to vehicle fuel 
consumption and eﬃciency, but they are beyond the scope of this 
article, which focuses speciﬁcally on engine eﬃciency and the role 
that fuel properties can play to maximize engine eﬃciency. 

Many of the engine technologies employed to enable a simul- 
taneous  increase  in  vehicle  power  and  fuel  eﬃciency  have  been 
combined in complementary ways. Broadly speaking, there are two 
dominant  pathways  to  increase  vehicle  eﬃciency:  one  pathway 
with high power density (HPD) that aims to decrease the engine 
displacement through engine downsizing, which allows engines to 
be used in more eﬃcient operating regions; and another pathway 
with lower power density (LPD) that aims to use an overexpanded 
Atkinson or Miller cycle to increase the peak engine eﬃciency. An 
overview of these two pathways is given in Sections 1.2.1 and 1.2.2 , 
respectively; the pathways are compared in Section 1.2.3 . The ther- 
modynamic basis for each of the contributing technologies is dis- 
cussed  in  Section  2.2 ;  the  way  that  fuel  properties  can  interact 
with these technologies to provide further eﬃciency improvements 
is discussed in Section 3 . 

1.2.1. High vehicle eﬃciency pathway 1. engine downsizing through 
high power density 

Engine  downsizing  is  the  process  of  using  a  smaller- 
displacement engine than was used in the previous generation of 
vehicle to deliver equivalent or improved performance. The extent 
of downsizing is shown in Fig. 4 as the production share of engines 
having 3, 4, 6, or 8 cylinders as a function of time [38] . During the 
increase in fuel economy from 2005 to the present, shown in Fig. 3 , 
the production share of four-cylinder engines has increased from 
just over 25% to more than 60%. Further, during this same time pe- 
riod, vehicle power continued to increase, which is also shown in 
Fig. 3 [38] . Thus, there has been a dramatic increase in the power 
per unit displacement, also known as speciﬁc power, of light-duty 
vehicles since 2005. 

Increasing the power density of an engine can be accomplished 
by increasing the maximum engine load, increasing the maximum 
engine  speed,  or  through  a  combination  of  these.  Conventional 
naturally-aspirated (NA) engines achieve maximum brake mean ef- 
fective pressures (BMEPs) of less than 15 bar. High-power concepts 
are deﬁned as anything that exceeds that threshold. Similarly, en- 
gine speeds above 70 0 0 rpm are generally considered to be high- 
speed concepts [44–46] , as shown graphically in Fig. 5 . For high 
eﬃciency,  modern  downsized  engines  operate  at  high  loads  us- 
ing charge boosting rather than higher speeds, where the friction 
penalties increase, and typically combine direct injection (DI) fuel- 
ing and boosting through the use of turbochargers. Typical forms 
of charge boosting increase the BMEP to about 20 bar, but further 
increases in high-load engine concepts employing more aggressive 
downsizing strategies are possible, with some production engines 
achieving  30 bar  BMEP,  and  several  researchers  reporting  engine 
operation up to 35 bar BMEP [47–52] . 

Turner et al. deﬁned a downsizing factor; as follows: 

DF = 

d NA − V 
V 
d 
Downsized 
V 
d NA 

(1) 

where DF is the downsizing factor and V 
NA  is the displacement 
d 
volume for comparably-powered NA and downsized engine alter- 
natives [52] . They reported that most downsized gasoline engines 
in  current  production  vehicles  have  a  DF  of  about  35%  to  40%. 
Some prototypes with a DF of 60% have been shown [ 47 , 52 ]. For 
production engines, downsizing is most often combined with down 
speeding as an effective measure to improve fuel eﬃciency, and 
beneﬁts of up to 10% have been shown in vehicle applications [44] . 
The  penetration  of  downsized  boosted  engines  in  the  market 
has increased dramatically since 2005 during the recent increase 
in fuel economy. The percentage of boosted engines sold increased 
from 1.7% in 2005 to 30.8% in 2018 [38] . Table 1 provides three ex- 
amples comparing the conventional and downsized engine conﬁg- 
urations with approximately constant vehicle conﬁguration and en- 
gine power. The examples shown include a small car (Honda Civic

1.2.2. High vehicle eﬃciency pathway 2. Low power density 

The technologies  for  the  high-eﬃciency pathway that  utilizes 
LPD vary to some degree but generally include direct fuel injec- 
tion and overexpanded engine cycles combined with high r c . Some 
of the engines in this category also utilize cooled EGR. As will be 
discussed in more detail in Section 2 , the overexpanded Atkinson

or Miller cycle, combined with the high r c , delivers higher peak 
eﬃciencies than the downsized engines can achieve, but because 
the displacement volume is not fully utilized with overexpanded 
cycles, the power densities of the engines are lower. 

The  US  EPA  benchmarked  one  of  these  engines,  the  2014 
Mazda  2.0 L  SKYACTIV-G  engine  [53] .  As  opposed  to  the  down- 
sized boosted engines discussed in the previous section, this en- 
gine had a very high r c (13:1), allowing it to produce a high peak 
η
b  (37.9%) [53] . However, it also had a signiﬁcantly lower power 
density (57.5 kW/L) than the boosted HPD engines. 
LPD engines that include EGR can increase η

b even more. Two 
examples of research involving hybrid-speciﬁc engines are reported 
by Hwang et al. [54] , who provided an overview of a 2016 1.6 L en- 
gine from Hyundai-Kia Corporation, and by Matsuo et al. [55] , who 
reported on a 1.8 L engine from Toyota Motor Corporation. The two 
studies produced similar results. Both engines achieved 40% η
b by 
combining DI fueling, Atkinson cycle operation, high geometric r c 
(13.0:1), and high levels of cooled EGR dilution (20% [54] and 25% 
[55] , respectively). Because they utilized high levels of EGR dilu- 
tion, the engines had low speciﬁc power outputs of 48.3 kW/L[54] 
and 39.4 kW/L [55] . 

A  similar  design  approach  was  taken  by  Hakariya  et  al.  [56] , 
who presented a 2.5 L engine from Toyota, which was then later 
benchmarked by the US EPA [57] . This engine achieved an η
b  of 
40%  using  DI  fueling,  Atkinson  cycle  operation  with  late  intake 
valve closing (LIVC), a high mechanical compression ratio (13:1), 
and up to 25% cooled EGR dilution. The difference with the 1.8 L 
Toyota engine is that the 2.5 L engine was intended for a conven- 
tional power train rather than a hybrid application, and it achieved 
a  higher  power  density  (60 kW/L)  than  the  Mazda  SKYACTIV-G 
[53] . 

1.2.3. Comparison of the high vehicle eﬃciency pathways 

Relative to the boosted HPD, the LPD pathway can produce a 
higher peak engine eﬃciency, up to 40% η
b  [54–56] . The higher 
η
b is largely due to these engines having a higher r c , but can also 
include  the  use  of  overexpanded  engine  cycles  and  EGR,  which 
are discussed in more detail in Section 2.2 . However, peak engine 
eﬃciency  alone is  not  a  good  predictor of  vehicle fuel  economy 
because the engine power demands can vary dramatically based 
on vehicle drive cycle, and the majority of engine operation dur- 
ing  drive  cycles  is  not  at  the  peak-eﬃciency.  Fig.  6  shows  the

energy-weighted speed and torque and corresponding energy ef- 
ﬁciency over the course of the urban dynamometer driving sched- 
ule (UDDS) and the US06 driving cycle for a mid-sized sedan with 
a continuously variable transmission [58] . The UDDS is a light-load 
driving cycle. Most of the fuel is consumed at less than 50% of the 
peak load and at speeds between 10 0 0 and 150 0 rpm. In contrast, 
the US06 driving cycle is much more aggressive, and a much larger 
fraction of the fuel is consumed at higher loads and at speeds over 
20 0 0 rpm. 

The HPD and LPD pathways differ in that they provide an eﬃ- 
ciency beneﬁt from different portions of the load range. To illus- 
trate  the  difference,  Fig.  7  shows  eﬃciency  as  a  function  of  en- 
gine torque for an NA port fuel injection (PFI) engine from 2005

eﬃciency  pathway  1  ( Section  1.2.1 ),  and  a  LPD  engine  to  repre-

sent  high-eﬃciency  engine  pathway  2  ( Section  1.2.2 ).  The  base- 
line engine data are from a GM 2.4 L 2005 NA PFI engine with a 
maximum power of 132 kW presented by Dugdale et al. [59] , from 
which a plot of brake speciﬁc fuel consumption at 1200 rpm was 
digitized and then converted to η
b assuming a fuel lower heating 
value (LHV) of 43.5 kJ/g. The downsized boosted data are from a 
Honda 1.5 L engine with a maximum power output of 130 kW that 
was benchmarked by Stuhldreher [60] . The η
b data for this engine 
were  not  available  at  1200 rpm.  Thus,  the η
b s  at  both  1001 rpm 
and 1251 rpm are plotted to illustrate that η
b  changes very little 
as a function of speed within that speed range. The overexpanded 
LPD Atkinson cycle engine of a Toyota 2.5 L engine with a max- 
imum power output of 150 kW was presented by Hakariya et al. 
[56] and was later benchmarked by Kargul et al. [57] . The η
b data 
from Kargul et al. [57] were available at 1153 and 1326 rpm. 

Fig. 7 shows that, relative to the 2005 GM NA PFI engine, there 
are  eﬃciency  advantages  for  both  the  high-power-density  path- 
way using a downsized boosted engine and the low-power-density 
pathway using an overexpanded Atkinson cycle and EGR dilution. 
At the lightest engine loads, the HPD pathway provides more of an 
eﬃciency beneﬁt than the overexpanded cycle, but at higher en- 
gine loads, the LPD pathway provides more of a beneﬁt. Thus, the 
way that the engines are used in a vehicle, in terms of transmis- 
sion pairing and vehicle duty cycle, determines which of the en- 
gines can provide the most eﬃcient vehicle. As a result, both are 
viable pathways moving forward. 

2. Factors that increase eﬃciency in SI engines 

Prior to understanding how fuels can improve eﬃciency in SI 
engines,  it  is  important  to  understand  the  thermodynamic  ba- 
sis for eﬃciency, as well as the engine technologies that are be- 
ing deployed by engine manufacturers to improve eﬃciency. Thus, 
Section  2.1  provides  a  thermodynamic  framework  by  which  to 
evaluate the ways that higher eﬃciency can be attained in an en- 
gine and Section 2.2 provides a discussion of the effect that indi- 
vidual technologies can have on eﬃciency from a thermodynamic 
standpoint.  Section  2.3  then  introduces  the  role  of  fuel  proper- 
ties on increasing engine eﬃciency in the context of the engine 
thermodynamics and other engine technologies being deployed for 
high eﬃciency. 

2.1. Thermodynamic expressions for eﬃciency in an SI engine 

Brake  thermal  eﬃciency  may  be  expressed  as  the  following

These component eﬃciencies are deﬁned below.

where BMEP is the brake mean effective pressure (the shaft work 
performed in one cycle divided by the engine’s displacement vol- 
ume) and IMEP n is the net indicated mean effective pressure (the 
indicated work performed in one cycle divided by the engine’s dis- 
placement  volume).  The  main  difference  between  indicated  and 
brake work can be attributed to engine friction.

leased by combustion to the amount of available fuel energy):

able to perform work (typically assumed to be equal to the fuel’s 
LHV). 

ηGE is  the  gas  exchange  eﬃciency  (representing  the  work 

penalty required to move air into the engine): 

ηGE = 1 +

IME P g 

(5) 

where  PMEP  is  the  pumping  mean  effective  pressure  (the  net 
amount of  work  performed during the gas exchange process di- 
vided by the engine’s displacement volume; for boosted operation, 
PMEP can be positive, so it is possible for ηGE  to be larger than 
unity). For reference, Section 2.2.3 includes a discussion of mini- 
mizing PMEP , including a visualization of the pumping work on a 
pressure-volume diagram in Fig. 10 . 

IMEP g is the gross mean effective pressure (the amount of work 
performed during the compression and expansion strokes divided 
by the engine’s displacement volume). 

σ HT is the proportion of total heat release available after wall 

heat losses have removed energy from the system: 
σHT = 1 − Q HT 
Q HR

where Q HT is the total energy lost via wall heat transfer during one 
engine cycle. 

ideal is the eﬃciency of the ideal working cycle, which is fre- 
quently represented as the ideal Otto cycle ( ηOtto ), Eq. 7 . As is dis- 
cussed in Section 2.2.3 , however, η
ideal can be represented by other 
cycles as well.

2.2. High-Eﬃciency Engine Technologies 

For  engine  technologies  to  increase  η

b  and  ultimately  to  de- 
crease vehicle fuel consumption, they must affect one or more of 
the  terms  on  the  right-hand  side  of  equation  9 .  The  individual 
technologies  that  enable  these  eﬃciency  increases  are  discussed 
in Sections 2.2.1 through 2.2.7. Many of the technologies are ulti- 
mately used to increase r c within the acceptable knock limitations, 
which maximizes η
ideal , as described by Eq. 7 , or they are used to 
minimize pumping, maximizing ηGE . Thus, these two goals are dis- 
cussed before the individual technologies.

All engines aim to minimize friction to maximize η

mech . How- 
ever, while recognizing the importance of friction, this review arti- 
cle is focused on in-cylinder and emissions processes where fuel 
properties  can  provide  an  impact.  Thus,  direct  friction-reducing 
technologies are out of scope for this study, such as surface treat- 
ments and low-friction lubricants. However, fuels can have an in- 
direct impact on engine friction through downsizing. The down- 
sizing effect is accounted for empirically through the downsizing 
eﬃciency multiplier in Section 3.1.5 . 

In  order  to  achieve  an  acceptable  compromise  between  eﬃ- 
ciency and power density, all modern SI engines are knock-limited 
over the high-load portion of their operating range. This is illus- 
trated by Sluder et al. [61] in Fig. 8 , which shows speed-load oper- 
ating points over two different engine driving cycles, and which of 
those are knock-limited [61] . These results are speciﬁc to the en- 
gine and vehicle combination studied, which was typical of mid- 
size sedans in the U.S. market. While other combinations of en- 
gines and vehicles yield somewhat different percentages, the ma- 
jority of driving conditions on both schedules for a wide variety of 
engine and vehicle combinations are not knock-limited. Interest- 
ingly, Sluder et al. report that 92% of the engine operating condi- 
tions over the UDDS driving cycle are not knock-limited. The city 
portion of the US06 cycle is a much more aggressive driving sched- 
ule, but even that schedule results in over 67% of the engine op- 
erating conditions occurring in the knock-free region [61] . Engines 
are designed such that r c  is as high as possible while still being 
able  to  achieve  the  maximum  load  of  the  engine  at  a  predeter- 
mined level of knock mitigation. Thus, the selection of r c is a com- 
promise between maximizing eﬃciency over the lower load por- 
tions of the engine operating map while maintaining a high power 
density. 

At loads higher than the knock limit, spark ignition is retarded 
to later in the engine cycle, which is effective at mitigating knock 
because it reduces the pressure and temperature of the unburned 
gas prior to the consumption of the end-gas, slowing the autoigni- 
tion  reactions  that  cause  knock.  Retarding  the  ignition  also  de- 
creases σ
ideal by moving the heat release away from the point of 
minimum cylinder volume. The lost opportunity to extract work 
that is caused by late combustion phasing for knock avoidance was 
illustrated by Szybist and West [62] and is shown in Fig. 9 . 

Fig. 9.  Pressure-volume diagram illustrating the effect of late combustion phasing 
on engine eﬃciency at an engine load of 10 bar IMEP n at 20 0 0 rpm. One fuel (E85, 
green) is not knock-limited and advanced combustion timing is possible. The other 
fuel (UTG-96, blue) is phased later due to knock avoidance. The shaded area in 
red represents a lost opportunity to extract work from the engine cycle due to re- 
tarded combustion phasing for knock mitigation. Reprinted from Szybist and West 
[62] with permission of SAE International. 

Boosted HPD engines, as discussed in Section 1.2.1 , typically uti- 
lize a lower r c  than is used by LPD Atkinson-cycle engines, dis- 
cussed in Section 1.2.2 . This difference is partly due to engines be- 
coming more knock-prone at higher engine loads and partly due 
to the LPD Atkinson-cycle engines having a lower effective r c be- 
cause of the valve timing strategy being used, as will be discussed 
in Section 2.2.3 . Another emerging engine technology that aims to 
maximize r c  throughout the engine operating map is the use of 
variable  compression  ratio,  which  is  discussed  in  more  detail  in 
Section 2.2.6 . 

Minimizing pumping work, or maximizing ηGE , is another strat- 
egy that is commonly applied to various engine technologies, and 
there are numerous methods to achieve it. Pumping work at light 
engine operating load conditions occurs because the mass of fuel 
in-cylinder needs to be limited, and due to the requirement of a 
stoichiometric mixture for the effective function of the TWC, the 
mass of air also needs to be limited. Historically, this was achieved 
by throttling the intake airﬂow to lower the manifold pressure, re-

sulting  in  the  primary  source  of  pumping  losses.  Using  boosted 
HPD  engines  is  itself  a  strategy  to  minimize  pumping  work  be- 
cause, relative to a naturally aspirated engine, the intake manifold 
pressure only needs to be maintained below ambient pressure for 
the lightest loads and is above ambient pressure for much of the 
operable  load  range.  Such  a  situation  reduces  the  use  of  intake 
throttling.  This  de-throttling  effect  is  what  makes  HPD  boosted 
engines more eﬃcient than LPD engines at the lightest operating 
loads, as shown in Fig. 7 . 

LPD engines, and to a lesser extent HPD engines, utilize a host 
of  additional  technologies  to  maximize  ηGE  by  reducing  pump- 
ing  work.  The  technologies  include  overexpanded  engine  cycles 
( Section  2.2.3 )  and  cylinder  deactivation  ( Section  2.2.7 ),  both  of 
which reduce the effective displacement of the engine under part- 
load conditions. They also include utilization of cooled EGR dilu- 
tion ( Section 2.2.4 ), which maximizes the in-cylinder mass for a 
given load condition without increasing the air or fuel mass. Some 
technologies provide additive or even synergistic beneﬁts in fuel 
consumption; others may compete with one another because they 
represent  different  approaches  to  addressing  the  same  eﬃciency 
losses.  For  example,  combining  overexpanded  engine  cycles  and 
cylinder deactivation technologies has diminishing returns because 
both attempt to reduce pumping work by decreasing the effective 
engine displacement. 

2.2.1. Boosted engine operation 

As Heywood [63] explains, the maximum load that a given en- 
gine  can  deliver  is  limited  by  the  amount  of  fuel  that  can  be 
burned inside the engine cylinder, and the amount of fuel that can 
be burned is limited by the amount of air that can be inducted. 
Compressing the air to a higher density increases the air mass that 
can  be  inducted,  which  enables  the  engine  to  operate  at  higher 
load operation relative to a naturally aspirated engine. Thus, boost- 
ing the air system is a key enabling technology for HPD downsized 
engines. 

Boosting the intake manifold pressure can be done through ei- 
ther turbocharging, which uses exhaust gases to drive a compres- 
sor,  or  through  supercharging.  While  superchargers  are  effective 
at increasing engine power, they typically use mechanical power 
from the engine to drive a compressor, leading to eﬃciency loss. 
It is worth pointing out that electric superchargers can be paired 
with electricity recovered from regenerative braking in a mild hy- 
brid conﬁguration, resulting in some high eﬃciency synergies [64] . 
However, such use of electric superchargers is still under develop- 
ment and further consideration of this conﬁguration is outside the 
scope of this review. Turbochargers, on the other hand, are energy 
recovery  devices  that  use  waste  heat  in  the  exhaust  to  perform 
compression work on the intake air, making them a more eﬃcient 
technology than superchargers. With the trend of engine downsiz- 
ing, the use of turbochargers in gasoline engines has become com- 
mon, and the sale of boosted engines has risen from 1.7% in 2005 
to 30.8% in 2018 [38] . 

2.2.2. Direct injection fueling 

DI fueling uses either central-mount or side-mount fuel injec- 
tors to deliver fuel directly into the combustion chamber and is 
differentiated from PFI or carbureted fueling, which introduce the 
fuel upstream of the combustion chamber. DI fueling is advanta- 
geous for knock mitigation relative to PFI fueling because more of 
the heat of vaporization (HoV) of the fuel comes from the charge 
air itself rather than the metal surfaces of the engine [65] . Addi- 
tionally, a combination of DI fueling with variable valve phasing, 
over-scavenging,  or  some  fresh  air  blowing  directly  through  the 
cylinder during gas exchange can be used to remove all burnt gases 
without introducing un-burnt air-fuel mixture into the exhaust gas 
stream because of the ﬂexibility in timing the injection [66–68] . 

Together, these technologies act to reduce the in-cylinder temper- 
ature with DI fueling, thereby mitigating knock and allowing r c to 
be increased. DI fueling also increases the in-cylinder turbulence, 
which serves to shorten the combustion duration [69] , which ben- 
eﬁts σ
ideal . Using modern injection hardware and advanced engine 
calibration, DI fueling can also reduce fuel-wall interactions by tai- 
loring  spray  patterns  and  injection  durations  to  the  combustion 
chamber and the intake-generated ﬂow [70] . This makes more of 
the fuel available to the combustion event and increases combus- 
tion eﬃciency ( η

comb in Eq. 9 ). 

When the ﬁrst generation of modern gasoline DI engines was 
launched, in the late 1990s, the emphasis of improved eﬃciency 
was  squarely  placed  on  the  ability  to  run  fuel-lean  in  stratiﬁed 
charge  mode  [ 44 , 67 , 68 ].  Due  to  the  need  for  complicated  NOx 
emission controls systems and the restricted fuel eﬃciency gains 
made as a result of the limited operating range in that mode, au- 
tomotive manufacturers soon switched to a homogeneous stoichio- 
metric charge mode while utilizing the beneﬁts of DI, thus achiev- 
ing  an  increase  in  power  density  [ 45 , 66 , 71 , 72 ],  thereby  enabling 
engine downsizing. 

Thus,  DI  fueling  combined  with  turbocharging  are  the  essen- 
tial technologies for the HPD engine pathway with downsized en- 
gines discussed in Section 1.2.1 . Additionally, DI fueling is a key 
technology enabler to LPD engines. Because LPD engines are also 
knock-limited, they can take advantage of the HoV of the fuel for 
charge-cooling, which helps to mitigate knock. Further, the addi- 
tional turbulence from the DI fuel injection is useful for extending 
the EGR dilution tolerance, which is discussed in Section 2.2.4 . 

2.2.3. Overexpanded engine cycles 

The Otto cycle gives up potential for additional work extraction 
from  exhaust  gasses  which  are  at  higher  than  ambient  pressure 
at the end of the expansion event. Over-expanded cycles, namely 
the Atkinson and Miller cycles, utilize expansion ratios which are 
larger than the r c to allow further expansion of the exhaust gases 
for additional work extraction [73] . Thus, the ideal eﬃciency for an 
overexpanded cycle, ηOE , is higher than ηOtto for a given compres- 
sion ratio. 

Over-expanded engine cycles can also have a second major ef- 
fect of increasing the gas exchange eﬃciency ( ηGE ) by decreasing 
pumping work when the over-expansion ratio is continuously var- 
ied to act as a form of variable displacement. Most overexpanded 
cycles function by utilizing only a portion of the displacement vol- 
ume of the intake stroke. This is typically accomplished by using 
either early intake valve closing (EIVC) or LIVC. With EIVC, the in- 
take valve closes during the intake stroke, causing cylinder pres- 
sure to temporarily decrease below the intake manifold pressure, 
before returning to manifold pressure and above during the com- 
pression  stroke,  with  the  effect  of  reducing  the  trapped  air  and 
fuel mass without requiring throttling. Similarly, LIVC reduces the 
trapped air and fuel mass by drawing in a full cylinder charge, but 
then expelling a portion of the charge mass back into the intake 
manifold before the intake valve is closed. The effect of these two 
valve timing strategies on pressure-volume diagrams is illustrated 
in Fig. 10 [74] . 

Numerous  mechanical  strategies  can  be  used  to  implement 
EIVC  and  LIVC,  including  some  strategies  that  use  multiple  cam 
proﬁles through a lost-motion system [ 75 , 76 ] and some that use 
a cam-in-cam arrangement [77] . Using EIVC or LIVC to produce a 
high-eﬃciency engine allows the use of high mechanical r c , as is 
evident in the numerous production engines with r c  = 13:1 (see 
Section 1.2.2 ). This is possible because the effective r c is lower than 
the mechanical r c  when the compression stroke is only partially 
utilized. 

Overexpanded engine cycles are becoming common with LPD 
NA engines. However, numerous studies have shown that it is pos-

sible  to  combine  the  downsized  boosted  pathway  with  overex- 
panded technologies for further eﬃciency gains (for example, see 
Osborne et al. [78] ). 

2.2.4. Exhaust gas recirculation 

Cooled EGR is an engine technology that is being deployed as 
a method to increase engine eﬃciency. When cooled external EGR 
is  used,  a  fraction  of  the  exhaust  is  cooled  and  mixed  with  the 
incoming fresh air. This technology beneﬁts the ηGE , σ HT , and η
terms, but it can adversely impact the η
ideal terms. 

comb and σ

ideal 

The  overall  eﬃciency  advantages  for  high-EGR  conditions  are 
summarized in a  thermodynamic modeling study  by  Caton  [79] . 
The  additional  mass  added  by  the  EGR  causes  the  manifold 
pressure  to  increase  without  increasing  the  intake  oxygen  ﬂow, 
thereby maintaining a stoichiometric charge while decreasing en- 
gine pumping and increasing engine eﬃciency at part-load condi- 
tions, beneﬁting the ηGE term in Eq. 9 . Additionally, the adiabatic 
ﬂame temperature decreases with EGR dilution, typically causing 
the  heat  transfer  to  decrease,  beneﬁting  the σ HT  term  in  Eq.  9 . 
Also, due to a combined thermal and composition effect, the ra- 
tio of speciﬁc heats ( γ ) of the working ﬂuid increases with EGR, 
beneﬁting the η

ideal term in Eq. 9 , as described by Eq. 7 . 

In addition to the γ beneﬁt for η

ideal , Alger et al. [80] showed 
that EGR also reduces the knock propensity, through the reduced 
in-cylinder temperature, which could allow r c to be increased. Al- 
ger et al. [80] also concluded that every one percent increase of 
EGR was equivalent to a 0.5 octane number increase. Splitter et al. 
[ 81 , 82 ] conﬁrmed the reduced knock propensity effect using 15% 
EGR, which allowed the maximum load limit to be increased by 
more than 10% in a single-cylinder engine experiment. 

EGR can also alter the combustion process in ways that have 
adverse impacts on the terms in Eq. 9 . Speciﬁcally, EGR decreases 
the laminar ﬂame speed ( S L ) of the fuel, resulting in a longer com- 
bustion  duration  [ 83 , 84 ],  adversely  impacting  the  σ
ideal  term  in 
Eq.  9 .  In  addition  to  a  decrease  in  σ
ideal ,  the  use  of  EGR  dilu- 
tion is limited because of increased cycle to cycle combustion vari- 
ability, as measured by the coeﬃcient of variation (COV) of IMEP g 
[ 73 , 85 , 86 ]. Ozdor et al. showed that the increase in COV of IMEP g 
was directly attributable to the decrease in S L  and, in particular, 
the increased duration of the initial ﬂame kernel development [86] . 
Additionally, Szybist and Splitter [84] showed that EGR decreases 
the combustion eﬃciency, adversely affecting the η

comb in Eq. 9 . 

2.2.5. Advanced Ignition Systems 

Conventional  electrical  ignition  systems  are  comprised  of  ei- 
ther inductive coils or capacitor discharge units, and the underly- 

ing physics of these spark ignition processes are well-understood 
[ 63 , 87 ]. The total spark energy delivered to the gas in the spark 
plug is generally around 30 mJ [88] , which is one to two orders of 
magnitude greater than the minimum ignition energy required for 
stoichiometric  combustion  with  low  dilution.  Using  an  advanced 
ignition system can impact the terms in Eq. 9 to provide improved 
eﬃciency:  decreased  combustion  duration  for  a  higher  σ
ideal as 
well as higher η
comb . Further, advanced ignition systems can en- 
able higher levels of EGR dilution, which is thermodynamically ad- 
vantageous as discussed in Section 2.2.4 . Several types of advanced 
ignition systems are listed below: 

• Multiple spark plugs [ 88 , 89 ] 
• Discharging multiple ignition events in a single cycle [ 90 , 91 ] 
• An extended spark discharge ignition event [92] 
• Breakdown or blast wave ignition units [93–96] 
• Laser ignition systems [97] 
• Corona discharge ignition systems [96–99] 
• Plasma jet and rail plug ignition systems [100–106] 
• Low temperature plasma ignition systems [107–110] 
• Pre-chamber ignition systems [111–118] 

2.2.6. Variable compression ratio 

Variable compression ratio (VCR) technologies enable the use 
of increased mechanical r c  in the region of the engine operating 
map that is not knock-limited. This is done by varying the clear- 
ance volume at top dead center through four categories of mecha- 
nisms that do not involve varying the stroke of the engine: 

• vary the position of the crankshaft relative to the engine head 

(e.g., install the crankshaft in an eccentric cradle) [119] ; 

• vary the effective linkage distance between the crankshaft and 
piston,  which  can  include  using  a  variable-length  connecting 
rod  [120–122]  or  an  intermediate  linkage  between  the  crank 
throw and connecting rod [123–125] ; 

• move the head relative to the crankshaft [ 126 , 127 ]; or 
• use movable elements in the head as well as within the piston 

to contract or enlarge the clearance volume [128–133] . 

VCR strategies can be implemented in a continuously variable 
manner within a range of authority or can instead be designed in 
a two-step manner, where the system can vary between two dis- 
crete values of r c . The beneﬁts of both types of systems have been 
quantiﬁed. Shelby et al. estimated the beneﬁts of both continuous 
and two-step VCR for an r c range of 10:1 to 13:1 and found that a 
two-step implementation reduced fuel consumption 2.5% to 3.6% 
and  that  a  continuously  variable  strategy  was  similar,  offering  a

2.7% to 3.7% improvement [134] . Wolfgang et al. [122] estimated 
a larger fuel consumption decrease of 8.5% by combining VCR with 
an overexpanded engine cycle. 

2.2.7. Cylinder deactivation 

One early application of cylinder deactivation occurred in 1916, 
but it was not until the 1980s that several more attempts were 
made. In recent years, cylinder deactivation has become a main- 
stream technology that is being used to reduce vehicle fuel con- 
sumption, and in 2018, 12% of vehicle sales incorporated this tech- 
nology [38] . 

Cylinder deactivation is a technology that can be employed to 
change  the  effective  displacement  of  the  engine.  In  addition  to 
stopping  the  fuel  injection,  both  the  intake  and  exhaust  valves 
stop  actuating  so  that  there  is  no  excess  air  present  in  the  ex- 
haust,  allowing  the  TWC  to  maintain  high  NO x  conversion  eﬃ- 
ciency. Cylinder deactivation increases engine eﬃciency primarily 
by  decreasing  pumping  work,  or  increasing  ηGE .  For  example,  if 
half the cylinders are deactivated, the remaining cylinders are re- 
quired  to  double  their  net  power  to  maintain  demanded  power, 
allowing those cylinders to operate more eﬃciently at conditions 
that reduce throttling losses [135] . 

Cylinder  deactivation  has  historically  been  limited  by  tran- 
sient control and noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) constraints 
[135] .  In  recent  years,  however,  many  of  those  constraints  have 
been overcome. NVH constraints have been overcome with cylin- 
der deactivation largely due to improved control technologies, and 
the  next  generation  of  advanced  control  for  cylinder  deactiva- 
tion,  Dynamic  Skip  Fire  technology  [ 136 , 137 ],  has  recently  been 
commercialized  and  promises  to  extend  the  market  penetration 
of cylinder deactivation even further. Struhldreher [138] baselined 
a  4.3 L  six-cylinder  engine  with  and  without  cylinder  deactiva- 
tion and found that, at conditions between 1 and 4 bar BMEP at 
1250 rpm,  deactivation  can  increase η
b  by  more  than  three  per- 
centage points, which is more than a 20% relative improvement at 
the lightest loads. 

2.3. Fuel Property Impacts on SI Engine Eﬃciency 

Like the engine technologies discussed in Section 2.2 , fuel prop- 
erties that enable increases in η
b do so through changes to one or 
more of the terms on the right-hand side of Eq. 9 . Changes to the 
terms may be the direct result of the fuel property, or they may be 
indirect effects resulting from changes in engine design and oper- 
ation enabled by the fuel or required to mitigate undesirable ef- 
fects  of  a  fuel  property.  These  effects  may  be  analyzed  through 
knowledge of the impact of each fuel property on each term on 
the right-hand side of Eq. 9 . 

To  evaluate  the  merits  of  new  fuel  formulations  in  terms  of 
their expected impact on engine eﬃciency, the combined impact 
of the fuel’s properties on brake thermal eﬃciency must be quan- 
tiﬁed. It is useful to compare the merits of a new fuel with a refer- 
ence fuel, such that the relative improvement in thermal eﬃciency 
resulting from the use of the new fuel may be estimated. To this 
end, the merit function is deﬁned as the relative change in brake 
thermal eﬃciency computed as a linear combination of the new 
fuel’s properties:

• an established set of reference properties p 
• knowledge of the sensitivity of brake thermal eﬃciency to each

Identifying the fuel properties that can enable increases in ef- 
ﬁciency, and subsequently quantifying the potential eﬃciency con- 
tribution of each individual fuel property in an optimized engine 
conﬁguration, is not straight-forward. Performing these tasks was 
the major focus of the Co-Optima initiative’s effort s on SI engines 
as well as the focus of the remainder of this article. Section 3 de- 
scribes the fuel properties that have an eﬃciency impact through 
in-cylinder processes affected by knock-resistance metrics, HoV, S L , 
and PMI. Section 4 describes how fuel properties can impact ve- 
hicle eﬃciency due to the emissions controls required. In particu- 
lar, Section 4 focuses on the catalyst light-off temperature and the 
sooting tendency of the fuel. 

3. How fuels affect in-cylinder eﬃciency 

A  guiding  principle  of  the  Co-Optima  initiative  is  the  central 
fuel properties hypothesis (CFPH), which states that fuel properties 
provide an indication of the performance and emissions of the fuel, 
regardless  of  the  fuel’s  chemical  composition.  Historically,  some 
gasoline standards have been performance-based, which implicitly 
align with the CFPH. For instance, the composition of the fuel is 
not  considered  for  the  distillation  and  volatility  speciﬁcations  in 
the  ASTM  standard  for  gasoline  [140]  or  in  the octane  number 
measurements.  Rather,  they  are  performance-based  indicators  of 
fuel quality. However, other fuel standards are composition-based, 
such as the sulfur content of gasoline [140] and the California re- 
quirement to limit the aromatic content of the gasoline to 35 vol % 
and the oleﬁn content to 10 vol % [141] . 

Within the Co-Optima initiative, fuel components derived from 
biomass  are  being  considered  for  blending  with  gasoline  feed- 
stocks, and the evaluation criteria extend beyond fuel performance 
in an engine. The Co-Optima initiative is also evaluating the life- 
cycle  environmental  and  economic  impacts  of  bio-derived  fuels 
and the technology readiness and scalability of the fuel production 
technology [142] . The combined analysis of engine performance as- 
pects with environmental, economic, and scalability considerations 
can be found in a report by Farrell et al. [143] . The present study 
aims to provide an in-depth review of the engine performance as- 
pects of the Co-Optima initiative. 

A number of the fuel components and blending streams identi- 
ﬁed within the Co-Optima initiative have oxygen-containing func- 
tional groups that are not conventionally associated with fuels for 
SI  engines.  Historically,  fuel  for  SI  engines  has  been  limited  to 
petroleum-derived  hydrocarbon  streams  from  reﬁneries  (alkanes, 
oleﬁns,  aromatics,  and  naphthenes),  along  with  a  small  number 
of oxygenated compounds, namely ethanol, methanol, and methyl 
tertiary butyl ether. The potential for signiﬁcant changes in gaso- 
line  composition  calls  into  question  whether  performance-based 
metrics  that align with the CFPH are accurate  indicators of per- 
formance across the full engine operating map with changing fuel 
chemistry. 

To  develop  a  better  understanding  of  the  contributions  of 
individual  fuel  properties  and  their  adherence  to  the  CFPH, 
Section  3  focuses  on  the  role  that  fuel  properties  have  on  in- 
cylinder processes that can impact eﬃciency. Subsection 3.1 con- 
siders the various ways to measure and quantify antiknock prop- 
erties as well as their ability to accurately predict knock propen- 
sity  under  different  operating  conditions.  Subsection  3.2  focuses 
on  the  impact  of  the  various  ways  that  HoV  affects  engine  eﬃ- 
ciency, after which the role of S L is considered in Subsection 3.3 .

Subsection 3.4 examines the current state of knowledge on the im- 
pact of fuel properties on low-speed preignition (LSPI). 

References  are  made  to  the  Co-Optima  fuels  throughout 
Sections 3 and 4 . The ﬁve Co-Optima fuels were designed within 
the Co-Optima initiative as a means to test the CFPH (detailed de- 
scriptions of these fuels are given in Fouts et al. [144] ). The ﬁve Co- 
Optima core gasolines all have matched nominal RON of 98. One of 
these fuels, referred to as alkylate 
Co-Optima , has low octane sensitiv- 
ity ( S octane ), which is the difference between RON and MON and is 
discussed further in Section 3.1.2 , while the other four fuels have 
nominally matched S octane  between 10.2 and 10.9. Despite nomi- 
nally matched fuel properties, the four fuels with high S octane have 
signiﬁcantly different chemical compositions, as shown in Table 2 . 

3.1. Knock resistance 

3.1.1. Historical antiknock metrics 

The knock phenomenon was observed as early as 1876 [145] , 
but it was not until around 1900, when the advent of the carbu- 
retor  solved  the  major  challenge  of  providing  a  combustible  gas 
mixture, that knock became problematic and garnered more seri- 
ous attention [146] . Knock was initially diagnosed to occur as a re- 
sult of preignition, but by 1905, Ricardo concluded that it was the 
shock of a gaseous wave striking the walls of the cylinder, which 
he called “detonation” [146] . This inspired research into the knock 
phenomenon and the effect of fuels, including development of VCR 
research engines [ 147 , 148 ]. 

In conjunction with VCR engines to study knock, there was also 
a need to develop detailed cylinder pressure analysis to measure 
knock events. Midgley and Boyd, working with the National Bu- 
reau  of  Standards,  improved  upon  the  original  cylinder-pressure 
indicator designs invented by Watt for steam engines [149] . They 
also  compared  techniques  used  to  measure  “detonation” in  en- 
gines, such as using the listening method, cylinder pressure indi- 
cator method, temperature, and the bouncing pin, and concluded 
that  the  bouncing  pin  method  was  superior  [149] .  This  method 
consisted of a free pin placed loosely in a guide with the lower 
end placed on the cylinder head. During non-knocking operation 
the pin merely ﬂoated with the small ﬂexing of the cylinder head, 
however,  under  knocking  combustion  “the  cylinder  head  would 
ﬂex so violently that the pin was thrown free of its contact . ” [5] . 
The bouncing-pin mechanism was able to provide a robust mea- 
surement  device  for  quantifying  knock  by  comparison  of  results 
obtained with reference fuels by measuring the bouncing pin ﬂuc- 
tuation in a given time period using an electrolytic cell containing 
sulfuric  acid  and distilled water  [149] , as shown  in Fig.  11 .  This 
device was ultimately implemented in the standard knock-testing 
equipment, the Cooperative Fuels Research (CFR) engine [150–153] . 
Several groups recognized the need to have standard reference 
fuels to characterize the knock tendency of a test fuel, measured at 
the same time and under the same conditions [ 149 , 154 , 155 ]. Midg- 
ley and Boyd investigated using aromatics (benzene and toluene) 
as the non-knocking fuel and diethyl ether as the knock-enhancing 
fuel, but these were rejected because their knock tendency was ex-

mission of SAE International. 

tremely sensitive to AFR [149] . Other potential reference fuels pro- 
posed by Midgely and Boyd included cyclohexane, hexane, diethyl 
selenide, and a hexane-isopropyl nitrite [149] . 

The Ethyl Corporation subsequently proposed using n-heptane 
and 2,2,4 trimethyl pentane (iso-octane) as the reference fuels for 
octane rating [155] , and those fuels are still used today in the RON 
[3] and MON [4] tests and are known as the primary reference fu- 
els (PRFs). They argued that using iso-octane was deemed to be 
more suitable than toluene due to having a very similar hydrogen- 
carbon ratio and similar speciﬁc gravity as well as viscosity to that 
of n-heptane [155] . By 1931 the CFR Committee implemented the 
PRF octane number scale as part of the knock-testing equipment 
and designated it the Research Method, which later became the 
RON. 

It  was  soon  discovered  that  the  combustion  chamber  surface 
temperatures of the CFR engine during the RON test were not rep- 
resentative of automobile engines at the time. Although they met 
the RON speciﬁcation, some samples of gasoline were found to be- 
have differently in the ﬁeld. To rectify that, the MON test method 
was developed based on modiﬁcations to the RON test. Speciﬁcally, 
the engine speed and intake mixture temperature were increased 
to obtain combustion chamber surface temperatures representative 
of engines at the time [156-159] . 

While the RON [3] and MON [4] standardized tests are still used 
as the basis to quantify the knock tendency of a fuel, there has 
been a signiﬁcant amount of recent research to develop a better 
understanding  of  what  is  measured  in  the  RON  and  MON  tests. 
Speciﬁcally, the instrumentation of the CFR octane rating engine 
does not respond to the pressure oscillations after autoignition, but

rather the sharp pressure inﬂection prior to the oscillation [160–
164] . However, in a more recent study, Rockstroh et. al. [165] con- 
cluded that these phenomena were closely correlated. 

3.1.2. Octane index and the importance of octane sensitivity 

The MON test was developed after the RON test because the in- 
vehicle performance of the fuel was not adequately being charac- 
terized by the RON test [156–159] . The need for this was not sim- 
ply in absolute terms, but also in relative terms. In other words, 
the highest RON fuel would underperform lower RON fuels in ap- 
plication. Thus, the MON test conditions were an effort to address 
the reality that the relative ranking of knock resistance among a 
set of fuels changes as the engine conditions change. As a mea- 
sure of this, the concept of S octane was introduced, deﬁned as the 
difference between RON and MON. 

Leppard [166] investigated the chemical origin of S octane , focus- 
ing on different chemical classes. For alkanes, there is a two-stage 
ignition process: low-temperature heat release (LTHR) followed by 
a negative temperature coeﬃcient (NTC) region wherein the reac- 
tion rate becomes inversely proportional to the temperature. Those 
processes are followed by a high-temperature heat-release event. 
The chemical origins and dependencies of the two-stage ignition 
process were later elucidated in the development of chemical ki- 
netic  mechanisms  for  the  PRFs,  n-heptane  [167]  and  iso-octane 
[168] ,  the  paraﬃnic  fuels  that  deﬁne  the  RON  and  MON  scales. 
The  PRFs  undergo  knock  at  about  the  same  r c  in  the  RON  and 
MON tests even though the intake manifold temperature increases 
signiﬁcantly.  Thus,  the  NTC  behavior  makes  the  fuels  insensitive 
to changes in intake temperature. The insensitivity of autoignition 
to intake temperature with NTC was recently conﬁrmed by Split- 
ter et al. in a more modern gasoline DI engine where the knock 
limited combustion phasing did not change signiﬁcantly when in- 
take temperature was increased from 90 °C to 160 °C [169] . Because 
other paraﬃnic fuels also exhibit two-stage ignition behavior, low 
S octane  is  ubiquitous  among  paraﬃnic  fuels.  In  contrast,  Leppard 
[166] showed that neither aromatics nor oleﬁns exhibited the two- 
stage ignition behavior, and as a consequence, the r c for those fuels 
at the knocking condition in the RON test is signiﬁcantly different 
than at the knocking condition in the MON test, meaning that they 
have higher S octane . 

The  effect  of  S octane  was  further  investigated  by  Mittal  et  al. 
[170] in a chemical kinetic modeling study of an engine using three 
fuels with a RON of 96 and with S octane varying from 0 to 17. Fig. 12 
shows the crank angle of autoignition as a function of temperature 
for these fuels. At an intake temperature of 50 °C, which is similar 
to the RON test, all of the fuels autoignited at a similar crank angle. 
At cooler temperatures, the fuel with lowest S octane was the most 

prone to autoignition, but the trend is reversed at high intake tem- 
perature, where the fuel with the highest S octane is the most prone 
to autoignition. With the intake air temperature range of 50 °C to 
150 °C, the fuel with the lowest S octane is the least sensitive to the 
impact of changes in intake temperature, which is in agreement 
with Leppard [166] , who found that the NTC behavior of paraﬃnic 
low- S octane fuels made them insensitive to changes in intake tem- 
perature. 

In validation of the crossover in modeled autoignition propen- 
sity by Mittal et al. in Fig. 12 [170] , a crossover in the knock re- 
sistance between different fuels as engine conditions change has 
also been observed experimentally in modern engines by Vuilleu- 
mier et al. [171] and by Szybist and Splitter [172] . Vuilleumier et 
al. [171] observed the change in the rank ordering of fuel knock 
limits as a function of intake manifold pressure using nine fuels 
of varying compositions, shown in Fig. 13 , using a fuel matrix that 
included the Co-Optima core fuels discussed in Section 3 and de- 
scribed by Fouts et al. [144] . Knock limits were measured for both 
conventional steady-state continuously ﬁred operation with a 100% 
duty cycle and skip-ﬁred operation with a lower 20% duty cycle. 
The skip-ﬁred operation has lower surface and gas temperatures 
and  represents  the  knock  response  during  a  transient  from  low 
to  high  load,  which  engines  experience  during  vehicle  accelera- 
tion. Under the transient conditions, the knock-limited combustion 
phasing of the low- S octane  alkylate 
Co-Optima  fuel crosses over that 
of the research gasoline representative of commercial regular-grade 
gasoline (RD5–87). Relative to the alkylate 
Co-Optima , the RD5–87 has 
a lower RON (91 vs 98 RON) and a higher S octane (7 vs. 1.4 S octane ). 
Thus, despite its signiﬁcantly higher RON, the alkylate 
Co-Optima fuel 
is only more knock-resistant at low intake manifold pressures; it 
becomes more knock-prone under boosted conditions. 

Recently, the chemical origins of S octane  have been further in- 
vestigated by Westbrook et al. [173] . They conclude that electron 
delocalization caused by features of molecular structure, such as a 
carbon-carbon double bond incorporated in, or a hydroxyl group 
attached to, a carbon chain, leads to preferential hydrogen abstrac- 
tion  on  sites  that  have  a  low  probability  of  leading  to  isomer- 
ization after characteristic low-temperature oxygen addition reac- 
tions. The low rates of isomerization reduce the overall rate of low- 
temperature chain branching, which is responsible for LTHR. This 
leads to reduced low-temperature reactivity and reduced NTC be- 
havior, causing a difference in behavior between these types of fu- 
els (e.g., oleﬁns, alcohols) relative to paraﬃns, which is expressed 
as S octane . 

Independent  kinetic  modeling  studies  performed  by  Yates  et 
al.  [174]  and  Mehl  et  al.  [175]  demonstrated  that  the  RON  and

ally, the typical knock-limited pressure-temperature conditions for different engine technologies are highlighted. Reprinted from Yates et al. [174] with permission of SAE 
International. 

MON tests represent two different pressure-temperature trajecto- 
ries, as shown in Fig. 14 . The MON trajectory has a higher tem- 
perature at a given pressure and consequently avoids the pressure- 
temperature conditions that result in LTHR before encountering the 
pressure-temperature conditions of the NTC region. In contrast, the 
RON trajectory has a lower temperature at a given pressure, lead- 
ing to conditions that yield a much stronger LTHR event prior to 
entering  the  pressure-temperature  conditions  of  the  NTC  region. 
The stronger LTHR raises the temperature of the unburned fuel-air 
mixture, leading to increased knock propensity under these condi- 
tions. Thus, the relative knock-resistance order of fuels can change 
depending  on  the  pressure-temperature  trajectory,  and  the  rela- 
tive change in order is largely dependent on S octane . Further, Yates 
et al. [174] showed that carbureted engines operate at pressure- 
temperature trajectories between RON and MON, PFI engines oper- 
ate closer to the RON trajectory, and boosted DI engines can oper- 
ate at pressure-temperature trajectories outside the bounds of RON 
and MON. While Yates et al. [174] describe these engine technolo- 
gies in terms of their fueling technologies, the movement toward 
the RON trajectory can be attributed to a variety of technologies 
that reduce the temperature of the charge at intake valve closing, 
with  engine-breathing  technologies  being  particularly  important. 
There is also a signiﬁcant timescale difference between these tests 
such that the MON test (900 rpm) operates at an engine speed that 
is 50% faster than the RON test (600 rpm). However, considering 
that both of these tests operate at engine speeds that are signiﬁ- 
cantly slower than the speeds of modern engines, both tests rep- 
resent long-timescale conditions. 

To  relate  the  speciﬁc  performance  of  an  engine  and  fuel  to 
the  RON  and  MON  tests,  Kalghatgi  [ 176 ,  177 ]  pioneered  a  prac- 
tical  method  to  correlate  the  RON  and  MON  values  to  knock- 
limited spark advance (KLSA). This method requires a parameter, 
K, which is dependent on the engine operating conditions, to act 
as a weighting factor between RON and MON. The resultant octane 
index (OI) rating ( Eq. 11 ) correlates to the actual knock propensity 
of the fuel much more strongly than either RON or MON in mod- 
ern engines [177–179] . This allows the relative knock resistance of 
fuels to be determined at conditions in real engines, which differ 
from the RON and MON tests, as shown by Kalghatgi in Fig. 15 
[176] . 

OI = RON − K ∗S Octane 

(11) 

RON = 0 and K 

The variable K in Eq. 11 is a heuristic that allows the chang- 
ing knock propensity for different engine conditions to be under- 
MON = 1, but for all other op- 
stood. By deﬁnition, K 
erating  conditions  K  is  derived  empirically  and  does  not  have  a 
fundamental underpinning. In his early work, Kalghatgi [ 176 , 177 ] 
explained that K is determined through a multivariable linear re- 
gression analysis of KLSA. Since then, a variety of methods have 
been introduced to estimate K, including an empirical correlation 
that was dependent on the temperature at a compressive pressure 
of  15 bar  [180] ,  nonlinear  regression  analyses  [ 181 , 182 ],  and  di- 
rect comparisons with PRFs [179] . Zhou et al. [183] compared four 
methods of calculating K and determined that each method had 
strengths and weaknesses. For the linear and nonlinear regression 
methods, the determination of K was very sensitive to the design 
of the fuel matrix. In particular, if RON and S octane were highly cor- 
related, the determination of K was unreliable. When attempting to 
determine K from direct comparisons with PRFs, only OI values be- 
low 100 may be compared with PRFs, because the maximum OI for 
a PRF blend ( S octane = 0) is 100. Extension of the PRF scale to values 
> 100 requires the addition of TEL [ 3 , 4 ], which introduces a differ- 
ent chemical pathway to knock mitigation, a conceptual deviation 
from the < 100 RON and MON scale, and more uncertainty. This is 
of particular consequence when K is negative because negative K 
values coupled with high- S octane fuels can yield OI values in the 110 
to 150 range, making direct comparison between a high- S octane fuel 
and a lead-free PRF impossible at those conditions. Considering the 
various ways in which K can be estimated for a given engine and 
operating condition, combined with a lack of ﬁrst-principles physi- 
cality associated with K, a regression from experimental data is the 
most accepted method to determine K, judged by representation in 
the literature [ 171 , 176 , 178 , 180 , 184 , 185 ]. 

Kalghatgi  [ 176 , 177 ]  also  explained  that,  although  an  empiri- 
cal  correlation  is  the  most  reliable  method  of  determination,  K 
is also a descriptor of the trajectory of the compression process 
in the engine through the pressure-temperature domain. Pressure- 
temperature trajectories that have a negative K value are “beyond 
RON” because they have a higher pressure at a given temperature 
than the RON test. Pressure-temperature trajectories that have a K 
value that is greater than unity are “beyond MON” because they 
have a temperature that is greater than the MON test at a given 
pressure. Boosted SI engines typically correspond to a negative K 
value under knocking conditions [ 184 , 185 ], whereas homogeneous

temperature trajectory is in the “beyond MON” region. At an intake 
manifold pressure of 1 bar, the pressure-temperature trajectory is 
close to that of the RON test. All the boosted operating conditions 
are “beyond RON.” This trend also agrees closely with the varia- 
tion of unburned gas temperature with different conditions shown 
by Amer et al. [184] . 

Szybist and Splitter [190] explored the relationship between the 
physicality of the pressure-temperature trajectory and the K factor 
as determined by a linear regression analysis for boosted operating 
conditions. The analysis involved varied intake temperatures and 
EGR rates at stoichiometric operation for seven different fuels, in- 
cluding three of the Co-Optima core fuels discussed previously in 
Section 3 [144] . Their ﬁndings, shown in Fig. 17 , illustrate that the 
physical description of K representing a trajectory in the pressure- 
temperature domain is incomplete or that it is not completely de- 
scriptive of the physical phenomenon. As expected, the most neg- 
ative K value has the pressure-temperature trajectory that is the 
pressure-temperature  trajectory  furthest  beyond  the  RON.  How- 
ever, their results show that there is a maximum K value where 
K approaches zero and that it then starts to decrease again as the 
RON condition is approached. Thus, while the physical explanation 
of the K factor explains much of the trend, it does not fully explain 
the phenomenon. 

K  is  not  strictly  a  representation  of  the  compression  trajec- 
tory in the pressure-temperature domain; however, thinking of it 
as  such  can  provide  useful  insights.  Speciﬁcally,  several  studies 
have shown that the fuel can shift the trajectory in the pressure- 
temperature domain and hence can change K. Szybist and Split- 
ter [190] and Ratcliff et al. [191] show that fuels with higher HoV

charge compression ignition (HCCI) engines correspond to K values 
greater than unity [ 179–184 , 186–188 ]. 

This  pressure-temperature  framework  was  illustrated  graphi- 
cally by Szybist et al. [189] and paired with a notional model of 
pressure-temperature trajectory across a range of intake pressures, 
as  is  shown  in  Fig.  16 .  The  results  of  the  notional  model  illus- 
trate that the trajectory through the pressure-temperature domain 
changes  signiﬁcantly  with  intake  manifold  pressure.  At  the  two 
lowest intake manifold pressures, 0.5 and 0.75 bar, the pressure-

such as ethanol blends can cause lower temperature at intake valve 
closing, hence producing a lower temperature trajectory. Addition- 
ally, the exhaust temperature is affected by the knock-limited com- 
bustion phasing [192] , which has an effect on the trapped residual 
fraction and intake valve closing temperature and ultimately on the 
pressure-temperature trajectory. Thus, K may best be viewed as a 
factor that is not strictly an indication of the engine operating con- 
dition, but as a variable that can be affected by engine design, en- 
gine operating condition, and fuel-engine interaction. 

In a separate study, Szybist and Splitter [172] present results to 
show that the regions of LTHR that lead to knock do not vary lin- 
early with S octane . Their results, shown in Fig. 18 , illustrate that the 
regions of LTHR that lead to low- S octane  fuels being more knock- 
prone in the beyond-RON region can be identiﬁed through kinetic 
modeling. The regions of LTHR are fuel-speciﬁc but are generally 
larger for the low- S octane  fuels, thereby providing a directionally 
correct kinetic basis for OI. 

3.1.3. Accuracy and limitations of octane index 

While  the  OI  approach  to  ranking  fuel  knock  resistance  has 
proven to be a more effective predictor of knock than RON, MON, 
or AKI [ 176 , 178 , 180 , 184 ], the OI metric is not fully predictive for 
knock-limited SI operation. Szybist and Splitter [190] investigated 
seven fuels at eight different boosted knock-limited operating con- 
ditions and reported R 2 correlation coeﬃcients ranging from 0.60 
to  0.88.  Similarly,  Vuilleumier  and  Sjöberg  [171]  reported  an  R 2 
value of 0.84 using nine different fuels, including the Co-Optima 
core fuels, under boosted knock-limited conditions [144] . However, 
Fig. 19 shows that even with an R 2 correlation coeﬃcient of 0.84, 
the departures from the predicted combustion phasing can be sig- 
niﬁcant, with knock-limited combustion phasing differences of up 
to 4 crank angle degrees (CAD) for fuels of similar OI [171] . The 
study  encompassed  an  uncertainty  assessment  which  suggested 
that  these  deviations  are  caused  by  real  fuel  effects  that  the  OI 
approach  cannot  fully  capture,  but  the  chemical  and/or  physical 
causes for the deviations were not determined. 

In addition to individual fuels behaving as a outliers when de- 
termining  K  at  a  given  operating  condition  in  a  speciﬁc  engine, 
the  determination  of  K  does  not  appear  to  be  transferrable  be- 
tween  different  engines.  Vuilleumier  and  Sjöberg  [171]  reported 
a K value of -3.2 under a load-transient condition when the in- 
take pressure was 146 kPa. In contrast, under steady-state condi- 
tions with a similar intake manifold pressure of 143 kPa, Szybist 
and Splitter [190] reported a K value of -1.25. While these exper- 

iments had many differences, including engine speeds (1400 rpm 
vs 20 0 0 rpm) and r c (12:1 vs. 9.2:1), this is a very large difference 
in K value given the similar intake manifold pressures. Similarly, in 
a vehicle study, Prakash et al. [185] found a wide range of K val- 
ues for similar operating conditions, including values as low as -4, 
which they considered to be nonphysical. They concluded that the 
roles of other fuel properties, speciﬁcally the effect of vapor pres- 
sure on the fuel-air mixing process, can have a large impact on 
the K value determination, and that those effects can be vehicle- 
speciﬁc. In supporting this conclusion, Rockstroh et al. [193] deter- 
mined that K was highly dependent on the fuel subset that was 
used to determine K. For a single operating condition, they found 
that  K  could  vary  from  -0.68  to  + 0.69  simply  by  the  choice  of 
the fuel subset used. This is consistent with Zhou et al. [183] who 
reported that the determination of K via regression analyses was 
highly sensitive to the fuel matrix that was used. The lack of trans- 
ferability demonstrates the challenges of attempting to capture the 
differences in engine design, engine operating conditions, and fuel- 
engine interactions into a single term. 

The  results  of  Szybist  and  Splitter  [190]  and  Vuilleumier  and 
Sjöberg [171] are somewhat in contrast to other works in the lit- 
erature, which demonstrate good agreement between the OI and 
observations of knock resistance in stoichiometric SI engines, often 
yielding R 2 values of 0.90–0.99 [ 178 , 180 ] . These discrepancies nat- 
urally lead to questions regarding the underlying causes. However, 
it  has  previously  been  shown  that  extending  the  OI  framework 
beyond  conventional stoichiometric operation, and speciﬁcally to 
HCCI  operation,  has  had  mixed  results,  indicating  that  universal 
application to autoignition problems is not appropriate. Kalghatgi 
[186] reported that the OI framework could be extended to HCCI 
operating  conditions  in  which  the  charge  conditions  differ  from 
those found in stoichiometric SI engines. However, conditions have 
been identiﬁed in which the OI approach to ranking fuel behavior 
does not hold. Risberg et. al. [194] found that internal EGR rates 
above  50%  by  mass  leading  to  high  in-cylinder  temperatures  in 
beyond-MON-type HCCI conditions caused all tested fuels to be- 
have similarly despite varying RON and MON ratings. Shibata et. 
al. [195] demonstrated the lack of physicality of the K factor arising 
from NTC behavior and suggested that this makes the OI inappro- 
priate for use with HCCI engines. These studies raise the question 
of what are the ranges of conditions under which the OI is applica- 
ble; it is clear that, as autoignition conditions deviate too far from 
the RON and MON conditions, eventually an extrapolation of these 
data points will not be suﬃcient.

To  better  understand  the  uncertainty  associated  with  OI,  and 
speciﬁcally the K factor determination, Vuilleumier et. al. [ 196 , 197 ] 
performed a detailed uncertainty analysis using the data shown in 
Fig. 19 [171] of matched RON and MON fuels to assess the relative 
contributors of different sources of uncertainty and how the rela- 
tive uncertainty varies with operating conditions (as represented 
by  K).  The  uncertainty  analysis  was  carried  out  through  Monte 
Carlo  simulations,  which  perturbed  the  inputs  to  the  linear  re- 
gression used to determine K—namely the RON, MON, and knock- 
limited phasing of each fuel at each condition based on the indi- 
vidual uncertainties associated with each measurement. They de- 

termined that there were probabilistic distributions of the K value 
and that a high degree of uncertainty exists in the linear regression 
of K for highly negative K values. Fig. 20 summarizes the results 
of the Monte Carlo simulations across a range of conditions, plot- 
ting the nominal K value (regressed with nominal data), the mode 
K value of the distribution (peak of the probability distribution in 
[171] ), and 10th and 90th percentile values of the distribution. This 
ﬁgure highlights the characteristic increase in uncertainty in the OI 
as the operating conditions are extrapolated to K << 0, which is a 
condition that may be encountered for boosted SI operation.

Returning to the question of the extent of the applicability of 
OI, both HCCI and SI engine studies have demonstrated that such 
limits  can  be  exceeded.  Considering  the  K  values  in  Fig.  20 ,  it 
is  shown  that  a  relatively  moderate  level  of  intake  pressure  in- 
crease  leads  to  highly  negative  K  values  at  a  low-temperature, 
transient operating condition. Kalghatgi [180] shows the pressure- 
temperature trajectories associated with various K values ranging 
from -0.33 to 1, shown in Fig. 21 . The nonlinearity of K as a func- 
tion  of  temperature  at  a  constant  pressure,  and  particularly  the 
steep decrease in K for K values < 0, hints that if the charge tem- 
perature is decreased signiﬁcantly below the RON test temperature, 
the K value will become highly negative, leading to greater errors 
in extrapolating the RON and MON test results, as was found to be 
the case in the global sensitivity analysis performed by Vuilleumier 
et. al. for a negative K condition [171] . Further insights into the 
uncertainty of the OI in the negative K value regime are provided 
by Prakash et. al. [185] , where the octane appetites of modern ve- 
hicles were assessed using both steady-state and transient testing 
methodologies. Prakash et al. demonstrated both the low K values 
that can be encountered in the operation of modern vehicles and 
the uncertainty associated with assessing the K value. Steady-state 
testing at 1500 RPM with two of the vehicles used in the study 
yielded K values of -4.2 and -6.1; the authors reveal that these two 
vehicles are in fact of the same make and model and that they 
deliver a signiﬁcantly different assessment of K, highlighting the 
variations in K value determination caused by presumably small 
differences in the vehicles or testing. 

3.1.4. The impact of knock resistance on eﬃciency 

In Subsection 3.1.3 it was shown that much about the OI rat- 
ing and K value determination remains uncertain. However, there 
is an overwhelming dataset that shows that the performance of OI 
is superior to other standard antiknock metrics that have been de- 
veloped, as discussed in Section 3.1.2 . Thus, OI will be used as the 
basis to determine the thermodynamic impact of a fuel’s knock re- 
sistance on eﬃciency. If the increased knock resistance provided by 

a fuel is exploited to increase the engine’s r c and decrease its dis- 
placement volume, knock resistance can affect η
b in several ways: 

• Increasing a fuel’s knock resistance enables increases in r c and 

therefore in the ideal thermal eﬃciency, η

ideal 

• The higher η

ideal that is enabled by a higher knock resistant fuel 
and higher r c increases the engine power if the engine displace- 
ment  is  held  constant.  Thus,  for  a  given  power  requirement, 
the engine can be downsized (a decrease in V 
d ), which affects 
pumping losses and changes ηGE for a given torque level. 

• For a given torque, increasing r c and downsizing may both af- 

fect the mechanical eﬃciency η

mech . 

• For a given torque, increasing r c and downsizing may both af- 

fect the heat transfer factor σ HT . 

Even when the r c is not increased and the engine is not down- 
sized in response to improved knock resistance of the fuel, increas- 
ing knock resistance typically allows spark timing to be advanced 
for operating points that would otherwise be knock-limited, as il- 
lustrated in Fig. 9 . Advanced combustion phasing increases the de- 
gree of constant volume combustion, σ
ideal , and thereby increases 
η
b . This effect is expected at high loads that are infrequently ex- 
perienced in light-duty drive cycles (see, for example, Chow et al. 
[65] ). However, it is neglected for this analysis because the impact 
of such operating points on the total fuel consumed during a typi- 
cal drive cycle is expected to be small (see Fig. 8 ). 

A merit function term will now be deﬁned to quantify the com- 
bined effects of knock resistance on η
b as described above, using 
the OI as the characteristic property. The chain rule is used to de- 
scribe how eﬃciency changes as a function of r c , V 
d , and OI as fol- 
lows:

3.1.5. Estimating the Impact of Knock Resistance on Eﬃciency from 
Literature 

Deﬁning the terms of Eq. 13 is not a simple exercise, as they 
are inﬂuenced by engine design parameters as well as details of 
the engine operating conditions within the speed/load map. Chow 
et al. [65] and Leone et al. [198] approach this with a three-step 
method. 

The ﬁrst step is an assumption about the degree to which an 
∂ r c 
increase in OI enables an increase in r c , expressed as 
∂OI . Leone 
et  al.  provide  a  range  of  values  for  the  increase  in  r c  enabled 
by  increases  in  knock  resistance  based  on  experimental  studies 
(RON + improved  knock  resistance  from  HoV,  to  be  addressed  in 
Section 3.2 ). They show that the value of this term can vary widely 
but estimate its value to be 1/3 for a well-developed combustion 
system that has been optimized for the higher compression ratio 
[198] . This is similar to Yokoo et al. , who found the value to be 
0.3 for a naturally aspirated engine [199] . Chow et al. assume this 
value to be ¼ but do not provide further support for their assump- 
tion [65] . For this derivation, it is assumed that the increase in RON 
is equal to the increase in octane index; S octane is assumed to re- 
∂ r c 
main constant. A value of 1/3 is used for 
∂OI , meaning that an in- 
crease in octane index of three points is assumed to enable an in- 
crease in compression ratio of one point. This is a critical assump- 
tion and the range of fuel properties, engine designs, and engine 
operation over which it is valid remains to be demonstrated. 

The  second  step  is  to  estimate  the  change  in  eﬃciency  that 
results from this increase in compression ratio. In the context of 
Eq. 13 , this is equivalent to the following sum:

Leone et al. provide data for experimental and theoretical stud- 
∂ η
ies that indicate  1 
∂ r c  decreases as the engine’s initial r c increases 
η
b 
and  that  it  is  in  the  approximate  range  of  1%  to  3%  per  unit 
compression-ratio increase for compression ratios between 9:1 and 
12:1 [198] . Engine system modeling using GT-Power software was 
performed by Chow et al. and supports this ﬁnding for r c between 
10:1 and 11:1 [65] . Based on the data provided in the two stud- 
∂ η
ies, a conservative estimate for the value of  1 
∂ r c  is 1.6% per unit 
η
b 
compression-ratio increase. 

∂ η
The third step in estimating  1 
∂OI  is to determine the addi- 
η
b 
tional eﬃciency beneﬁts that result from downsizing an engine to 
maintain its performance level after the r c  increase. These bene- 
ﬁts depend on the engine operating point, the degree to which the 
engine’s operation is knock-limited, and whether the engine is tur- 
bocharged. While Smith et al. [200] report a downsizing eﬃciency- 
multiplier factor of 1.6, this is an aggressive estimate that is spe- 
ciﬁc to boosted engines. Leone et al. suggest downsizing eﬃciency- 
multiplier factors of 1.3 and 1.1 for NA and turbocharged engines, 
respectively [198] . To make the analysis broadly applicable to both 
boosted and NA engines, an average value of 1.2 is assumed in this 
discussion and the following analysis. 

∂ η
To summarize the process described above to estimate  1 
b 
∂OI , 
η
b 
the conclusion based on several studies reported in the literature 
indicate that an increase in OI of three points allows the compres- 
sion ratio to be increased by a single point, thus increasing the ef- 
ﬁciency by 1.6%. With the eﬃciency multiplier of 1.2 due to down- 
sizing, the three-point OI increase results in a 1.9% eﬃciency in- 
1% 
crease. Therefore,  1

loop. Simulations are run for a range of engine speeds and loads at 
two different r c values and for two different V 
d values. Heat release 
proﬁles are simulated using a Wiebe function. Combustion dura- 
tion is assumed to be a function of engine speed, and combustion 
phasing is retarded at lower speeds and higher loads to simulate 
knock-limited operation. The parameters for these functional rela- 
tionships are taken from engine experiments and/or from the four- 
cylinder turbocharged engine example in GT-Power. These combus- 
tion phasing and duration relationships are maintained regardless

of r c and V 
33% of the US06 cycle may be expected to involve knock-limited 
operation, so the impact of these simplifying assumptions on cu- 
mulative fuel consumption is expected to be limited [61] , as shown 
in Fig. 8 . The simulation parameters are summarized in Table 3 .

eﬃciency by 1% is smallest at lower loads and higher speeds. The 

b 

largest contributor to this eﬃciency improvement is the increase in 
ideal cycle eﬃciency due to the increased r c . However, heat trans- 
fer losses also increase as r c is increased; the beneﬁts of increased 
OI are reduced at lower engine speeds, as more time is available 
for  heat  transfer  to  occur.  Increasing  r c  also  increases  throttling 
losses for a given torque output, but downsizing the engine and 
maintaining this torque output results in a net increase in gas ex- 
change eﬃciency, especially at lower loads where throttling losses 
are more signiﬁcant. Finally, downsizing the engine decreases fric- 
tion more at low loads than at high loads, so the mechanical eﬃ- 
ciency is improved most at low loads. Thus, the amount OI must 
be increased to achieve a 1% eﬃciency improvement is lowest for 
high engine speeds and low loads. 

While the eﬃciency beneﬁts of increasing OI depend strongly 
on engine design and operation, the intention of the merit func- 
tion is to provide a basis for evaluation and comparison of alterna- 
tive fuel candidates. The strong nonlinearity in engine eﬃciency at 
lower loads leads to strong dependence of relative eﬃciency im- 
provements on OI. Powertrain design decisions that determine en- 
gine operating speeds will also inﬂuence the potential relative ef- 
ﬁciency beneﬁt for a given increase in OI. The extent to which an 
increase in OI can enable an increase in r c  has been assumed to 
be constant for this analysis, but it may be expected to decrease at 
higher r c due to changes in chemical kinetic behaviors for different 
fuels. Changes in knock-limited operation have been neglected for 
this analysis, speciﬁcally the engine load at which the engine ini- 
tially encounters knock-limited operation and the extent of com- 
bustion phasing retard at peak load. While any changes made to 
these design inputs will affect the realizable eﬃciency beneﬁts as 
OI increases, there is insuﬃcient information available to provide 
insight on the magnitude of these changes. Furthermore, wall heat 
transfer has a signiﬁcant impact on the eﬃciency beneﬁts that may 
be realized as fuel knock resistance is increased, and changes in 
engine design may alter these eﬃciency beneﬁts.

3.2. Heat of vaporization 

3.2.1. Thermodynamic impacts of HoV on engine eﬃciency 

The fuel’s HoV can impact eﬃciency in multiple ways. The ﬁrst 
is through its inﬂuence on the fuel’s knock resistance. For DI en- 
gines, the in-cylinder fuel vaporization process reduces the charge 
temperature. This increases charge density, resulting in either in- 
creased power output or increased throttling requirements through 
improved  volumetric  eﬃciency,  and  the  reduced  charge  temper- 
ature  can  provide  improved  eﬃciency  through  knock  mitigation 
[201–205] . Cooling for hydrocarbon fuels provides the same effect 
as an increase of roughly 5 OI units in a boosted DI engine relative 
to  a  PFI-fueled  engine [198] —consistent with  an earlier  estimate 
that  7 K  of  cooling  is  equivalent  to  a  1  octane  number  increase 
[206] . 

Low-molecular-weight alcohols such as methanol and ethanol 
exhibit  much  higher  HoV  than  gasoline  boiling  range  hydrocar- 
bons. Blending of ethanol into gasoline has been shown to signiﬁ- 
cantly increase HoV, as shown in Fig. 23 [207] . The thermodynamic 
maximum charge cooling can be estimated by assuming that the 
fuel is evaporating into the air at the same temperature, evapora- 
tion is completed during the intake stroke, and there is no heat 
transfer. The temperature change for this ideal adiabatic cooling is 
shown in Fig. 24 for stoichiometric mixtures of ethanol blended 
into several gasoline blendstocks at different fuel/air starting tem- 
peratures [207] . The amount of cooling decreases with increasing 
temperature because HoV decreases with increasing temperature, 
ultimately becoming zero at the critical temperature (for a pure 
component). Kasseris and Heywood showed that, for their test en- 
gine, between 70% and 80% of the theoretical maximum cooling 
was typically achieved [202] . Based on simulations, they suggested 
that a higher percentage of the theoretical maximum cooling could 
be obtained at higher intake air temperatures. 

While the beneﬁts of DI are well established, and many of those 
beneﬁts are derived from charge cooling and increased charge mo- 

tion, there is a lack of consensus in the literature regarding the 
magnitude of the effect of additional charge cooling from methanol 
or ethanol blending. For example, Wyszynski and coworkers mea- 
sured a 9% improvement in volumetric eﬃciency for DI versus PFI 
using a hydrocarbon gasoline at wide open throttle (WOT), and a 
further 3% improvement for a 10 vol % methanol or ethanol blends 
[205] . Kasseris and Heywood report that increased HoV increases 
the  effective  octane  rating  at  a  rate  of  about  0.15  octane  num- 
ber/vol % ethanol, and that the rate of increase is approximately 
linear in ethanol fraction, as summarized in Fig. 25 [203] . Stein and 
coworkers found that the chemical octane and evaporative cooling 
effects of ethanol blends on knock were of comparable importance 
[208] . In contrast, a comprehensive multicylinder engine study has 
indicated that, for ethanol fractions of less than 30%, there is a neg- 
ligible  impact  of  HoV  on  knock-limited  spark  advance  at  low  to 
moderate loads, and only a small effect at high loads, when RON 
and MON are held constant ( Fig. 26 ) [209] . The authors suggest 
that the charge cooling effect of added ethanol is at least partially 
captured in the RON test because intake air temperature is set up- 
stream of the carburetor [3] . 

Foong and coworkers studied evaporative cooling from ethanol 
blends on the RON test [210] . They showed that increased evap- 
orative cooling reduced the intake mixture temperature to below 
that observed with the hydrocarbon fuels for ethanol blends up to 
about 40 vol % ethanol ( Fig. 27 a). No further cooling was observed 
above that ethanol level, likely because the fuel-air mixture was 
saturated and liquid fuel droplets were being inducted into the en- 
gine. A modiﬁed RON test was developed where the intake air was 
heated to maintain intake mixture temperature at the same level 
as observed for hydrocarbon-only fuels. A comparison of RON and 
the modiﬁed RON for ethanol blends from zero to 100% ( Fig. 27 b) 
shows little impact of increased HoV on RON up to approximately 
30 to 40 vol % ethanol, but at higher ethanol levels RON was sig- 
niﬁcantly higher on the standard RON test. Note that heating the 
intake air temperature caused the ethanol blends to have higher 
knock  intensity,  and  therefore  lower  modiﬁed  RON  ratings  than 
their initial standard RON ratings. From those results, Leone et al. 
concluded that the effect of HoV may be fully accounted for in the 
RON test for blends up to approximately E30 [209] .

Kolodziej et al. [211] used an instrumented CFR engine to fur- 
ther  study  Foong’s  modiﬁed  RON  method,  which  heats  the  up- 
stream intake air temperature (IAT), before the carburetor, for fuels 
with  higher  HoV  to  match  the  downstream  mixture  air  temper- 
ature (MAT), after the carburetor, to that of PRFs. This was done 
using PRFs (mixtures of n-heptane and iso-octane) blended with 
0  to  50 vol  %  ethanol  while  holding  RON = 98  constant.  Consis- 
tent with the ﬁndings by Foong et al. , increasing the IAT temper- 
ature  of  the  ethanol  blends  to  match  the  MAT  caused  them  to 
have higher knock intensities relative to the blend containing no 
ethanol  (PRF98),  resulting  in  a  reduced  RON  rating.  However,  it 
was also found that increasing the IAT upstream of the carbure- 
tor introduced three test artifacts to the modiﬁed test method: re- 
ductions to the cylinder pressure at spark timing (P 
ST ), the engine 
load  (IMEP g ),  and  fueling  rate,  shown  in  Fig.  28 .  To  compensate

proportion to the HoV of the fuel. When both the cooling effect 
of the increased HoV of the fuel and the reduced P 
ST were com- 
pensated for, the estimated effect of HoV on the RON of a given 
PRF-ethanol blend approximately doubled. However, the effect of 
HoV on RON was still ≤1 ON for 10 and 20 vol % ethanol blends. 
For 30–50 vol % ethanol, the effect of HoV on RON was estimated 
to be approximately 1.3–2.8 ON, respectively. 

Fig. 29 shows four methods for estimating the HoV effect on 
RON. The ﬁrst is the methodology from Foong et al. [210] of in-

sated P 
ST until it was the same as PRF98. The third case (demon- 
strated on the right side of Fig. 28 ) matched MAT with PRF98, but 
ST of that fuel at stan- 
matched P 
dard RON conditions. Most knock-limited spark advance studies of 
fuels on modern engines are carried out at constant IMEP g . There- 
fore, the fourth case matched MAT with PRF98 for each ethanol 
blend but also increased the intake pressure until the same IMEP g 
was achieved for all ethanol blends as PRF98. The HoV effect was 
estimated to have approximately a factor of 2 higher effect on RON 
with both cylinder pressure and MAT compensation than with only 
matching MAT [210] . When the intake pressure was increased to 
achieve constant IMEP g conditions for all ethanol blends as PRF98, 
the HoV effect on RON was estimated to be even higher, approxi- 
mately 3.5 times higher than the Foong et al. IAT heating method 
[210] . In all methods, the effects of HoV on RON were ≤1 RON for 
10 and 20 vol % ethanol blends. However, possibly important con- 
tributions from HoV start to occur for 30 vol % ethanol levels and 
higher. 

Sluder and coworkers [212] observed that, in studies showing 
an HoV beneﬁt, HoV and S octane are covariant because blending of

tions [ 191 , 215 ]. Ratcliff and coworkers showed that, for fuels with 
matched RON and S octane  but different HoV, there was no differ- 
ence in knock tendency at low intake-manifold temperature [191] . 
However, a substantial advantage was observed at higher intake- 
manifold temperatures. This group noted that as IAT was increased, 
the fraction of theoretical (adiabatic) cooling observed for the in- 
take mixture based on the temperature at the time the intake valve 
is closed also increased, likely because of more rapid evaporation 
and reduced heat transfer [202] . These results can be understood 
by again considering the OI, where, as discussed in the previous 
section, K is not strictly a representation of the compression tra- 
jectory in the pressure-temperature domain, but thinking of it as 
such can provide useful insights. With this view, the reduced tem- 
perature produced from the high-HoV fuels moves the compres- 
sion curve in the pressure temperature domain to lower temper- 
atures. This physical representation implies lower values of K for 
high HoV fuels (in agreement with Stein and coworkers [208] ), en- 
hancing the effect of S octane on knock resistance. A similar trend of 
shifting the pressure-temperature trace to lower temperatures for 
high-HoV fuels was observed in another study conducted within 
the Co-Optima initiative using the Co-Optima core fuels [190] . At 
high engine speeds when engine breathing becomes less eﬃcient, 
the higher trapped residuals act to increase the intake valve clos- 
ing temperature, indicating conditions where the HoV may play a 
more signiﬁcant role in knock reduction. 

Until further clariﬁcation is obtained, we conservatively assume 
that a fuel’s effective OI is affected only modestly by HoV and in- 
creases at a rate of about 0.01 OI units per kJ/kg of HoV. In other 
words, 
kJ/kg  . This value is supported by the increase 
in the RON value for the IMEP-matched condition in Fig. 29 and

blend under standard RON conditions, and (4) match MAT and compensating the 
engine IMEP g to that of PRF98. Adapted from Kolodziej et al. [211] . 

ethanol increases both HoV and S octane [ 202 , 203 , 208 , 213 ]. They also 
observed that studies that employed match blending to hold S octane 
constant while varying HoV do not show additional knock beneﬁt 
for higher-HoV fuels [ 209 , 214 ]. They proposed that HoV be consid- 
ered as a thermal component to S octane . While this theory holds at 
many conventional operating conditions, subsequent research has 
determined that even with matched S octane , HoV might have ad- 
ditional  knock  mitigation  potential  under  some  operating  condi-

than the level reported for splash-blended fuels by Kasseris and 
Heywood  of  0.15  ON/ethanol  vol  %  and  the  value  suggested  for 
ethanol blends above E40 of 0.16 ON/ethanol vol % by Leone et al.

measured value of the heat of combustion in a way that is not rep- 
resentative of the fuel injection and vaporization process in the en- 
gine, because the fuel begins in the liquid phase in the HoV mea- 
surement [216] . Thus, the actual amount of chemical energy that 
can be released as heat in the combustion chamber is higher than 
the measured LHV for any fuel with a positive HoV [217] . Because 
E85 has a higher HoV than gasoline, the amount of chemical en- 
ergy that can be released as heat during the combustion process 
is larger than is indicated by the LHV. This effect accounted for 
roughly half of the part-load eﬃciency improvement observed for 
E85 and is considered in the deﬁnition of combustion eﬃciency:

The HoV of a fuel mixture affects brake thermal eﬃciency by 
several other mechanisms. Jung et al. performed experiments and 
analysis to determine the mechanisms by which eﬃciency is im- 
proved with a blend of 15% gasoline and 85% ethanol (E85) com- 
pared  to  operation  with  gasoline  for  throttled  conditions  [214] . 
With  the  E85  fuel,  HC  and  carbon  dioxide  (CO

reduced, and η

cooling of the E85 reduces the cylinder pressure during the intake 
stroke  and  therefore  increases  the  pumping  work,  thus  decreas- 
ing ηGE ,  although  that  effect  was  very  small  for  E85  and  would 
be even less signiﬁcant for mid-level ethanol blends. Lower tem- 
peratures before and after combustion with E85 reduce wall heat 
losses, thereby increasing σ HT . These lower temperatures act to in-

Jung et al. provided an empirical estimate for the second group 
of  terms  in  Eq.  21  and  found  that,  overall,  vaporization  cool- 
ing  increased  the  thermal  eﬃciency  of  a  throttled  DI  engine  by 
about 4.2% between E0 and E85 or 1% for an increase in HoV of 
∼130 kJ/kg [214] . The estimate is likely conservative due to the rel- 
atively large displacement of the test engine compared to the dis- 
placement expected for a downsized engine. Thus, an estimate for 
the second group of terms in Eq. 21 is given by

Although considerations in this analysis are limited as to how 
HoV affects engine eﬃciency, HoV can also have other important 
impacts on engine operation, such as cold-start behavior and dif- 
ferences in the degree of enrichment needed for catalyst protec- 
tion. Both Szybist and Splitter [192] and Stein et al. [208] demon- 
strate that fuels with differences in high HoV and advanced com- 
bustion  phasing  can  result  in  reduced  exhaust  temperature  that 
can result in signiﬁcant changes to the need for catalyst protection 
at conditions near peak torque. This effect is diﬃcult to incorporate 
into the merit function because it strongly depends on the engine 
hardware system and the calibration. Some engines might not reg- 
ularly operate at conditions where the HoV will mean the differ- 
ence between enrichment and stoichiometric conditions, but other 
engine conﬁgurations could operate there frequently. It therefore is 
recommended that this factor be taken into account when individ- 
ual systems are being modeled with greater ﬁdelity.

3.3.1. Thermodynamic effects of ﬂame speed on engine eﬃciency 

A higher S L  can shorten the total burn duration and this has 
the  potential  to  increase  the  thermal  eﬃciency  if  a  more  ideal 

28

constant-volume  combustion  process  can  be  achieved.  However, 
for conventional non-dilute stoichiometric operation, the burn du- 
ration is normally suﬃciently short that very little gain is expected. 
Instead, it is considered here that the primary impact of increased 
S L on engine eﬃciency in stoichiometric SI engines is to increase 
the  EGR  dilution  tolerance.  The  overall  eﬃciency  advantages  for 
high-EGR conditions are described in detail in a thermodynamic 
modeling study by Caton [79] . First, additional mass from the EGR 
causes the manifold pressure to increase without increasing the in- 
take oxygen ﬂow, which at part-load conditions can decrease en- 
gine  pumping  losses  and  increase  engine  eﬃciency.  Second,  the 
peak in-cylinder temperature decreases with EGR, causing the in- 
cylinder heat transfer to decrease. Third, due to a combined ther- 
mal and composition effect, the γ increases with EGR relative to a 
stoichiometric mixture due to the dilution of the very low γ fuel 
components. 

Increasing S L increases EGR dilution tolerance by decreasing the 
cycle-to-cycle  variability of  the combustion  event [ 84 , 218 ]. Com- 
bustion stability and cycle-to-cycle  variability in SI engines have 
been  the  subjects  of  extensive  research  over  multiple  decades, 
and Ozdor et al. [86] performed a comprehensive literature review 
in1994 that  remains relevant. They  characterize the initial ﬂame 
kernel development, which is typically about a third of the total 
combustion  duration,  as  being  the  most  crucial  to  cycle-to-cycle 
variation because of its high sensitivity to a large number of fac- 
tors. During ﬂame kernel development, the laminar ﬂame speed of 
the mixture dominates the combustion rate; the turbulent ﬂame 
propagation stage dominates only after the ﬂame kernel is suﬃ- 
ciently large to be inﬂuenced by multiple turbulent eddies simul- 
taneously. Fuels with high ﬂame speed complete the early ﬂame 
kernel development process more quickly, making them less sus- 
ceptible to the stochastic cycle-to-cycle differences in turbulence 
and ultimately provide more stable combustion. 

The aforementioned reduction in throttling losses with EGR acts 
to increase ηGE . The γ of EGR is different from that of fresh air, 
so η
ideal may change with EGR addition. Assuming EGR 
dilution tolerance depends only on laminar ﬂame speed, the effect 
of the S L on brake thermal eﬃciency is given as

Data available in the literature do not provide a means to eval- 
uate all of the individual terms in Eq. 25 , but they are suﬃcient for 
an empirical estimate of the right-hand side of Eq. 24 . 

3.3.2. Determination of laminar ﬂame speed 

Diﬃculties and uncertainties in determining S L complicate the 
use  of  this  fuel  property  in  a  merit  function.  S L  is  dependent 
on pressure, temperature, and dilution, but measuring S L  at ele- 
vated pressures representative engine conditions at spark timing 
precludes the use of most ﬂat-ﬂame burners, which is the most 
common way to measure S L . Using a constant volume vessel has 
the advantage of reproducing pressure and temperature conditions 
that are relevant to engines [ 219 , 220 ], but these vessels produce 
spherical  ﬂames  and  burning  rates  that  can  differ  substantially 
from ﬂat ﬂame burners due to ﬂame stretch, or varying degrees

of ﬂame curvature and aerodynamic strain in the experimental de- 
vices [221–224] . While there are well-established theoretical meth- 
ods to extrapolate the unstretched S L from spherical ﬂames using 
the stretch rate, Markstein Length, and ﬂame area [225] , there is 
a signiﬁcant amount of uncertainty and disagreement with how to 
perform this extrapolation in-practice [ 219 , 226–234 ]. 

As a result of these complications, it is recommended that un- 
stretched  S L  measurements  from  ﬂat  ﬂame  burners  be  used  for 
merit function evaluation. Even for ﬂat ﬂame burners, S L measure- 
ments can be found in the literature at a variety of temperature 
and pressure conditions. Thus, the S L will be considered at a stan- 
dard condition of 1 atm and 353 K. In order to use S L  data mea- 
sured at other pressure-temperature found in literature, a power- 
law  scaling  correlation  (e.g.,  Metghalchi  and  Keck  [235] )  can  be 
adopted. Such a relationship scales the typical behavior of ﬂame 
speed  to  increase  with  temperature  and  decrease  with  pressure, 
allowing the ﬂame speed to be estimated over a broad range of 
conditions. 

3.3.3. Quantifying the effect of ﬂame speed 

Two  studies  have  quantiﬁed  the  extended  dilution  tolerance 
of stoichiometric SI combustion using fuels with a known range 
of  S L [84,  218].  The  increased  dilution  tolerance  was  assessed  at 
3% COV of IMEP g  [84] or IMEP n  [218] for low- and high- S L  fuels 
composed of pure components (iso-octane, n-heptane, toluene, and 
ethanol). Values for S L have been calculated both using a Le Chate- 
lier energy and the molar-weighted mixing law [236] at peak S L 
( (cid:9) = 1.1) and stoichiometric chemical kinetic modeling in Chemkin, 
at initial conditions of 1 atm and 358 K. 

In the ﬁrst of these studies, Szybist and Splitter [84] observed 
that, at 20 0 0 rpm and 3.5 bar IMEP g , there was a 50% relative in- 
crease (8% to 12%) in EGR dilution tolerance ( Fig. 31 ) when fuel 
S L increased from 45 cm/s (Fuel 1) to 50.3 cm/s (Fuel 5); each per- 
centage point (p.p.) increase of EGR indicated a rise in thermal ef- 
ﬁciency (ITE) of 0.064 p.p. In the second study, at 1500 rpm and 
5.6 bar  IMEP n ,  Kolodziej  et  al.  [218]  also  observed  a  4%  increase 
in EGR dilution tolerance (18.6% to 22.8%) when fuel S L increased 
from 45.7 cm/s (Fuel 2) to 52.1 cm/s (Fuel 4), as shown in Fig. 32 . 
For this study, each p.p. increase of EGR raised ITE by 0.11% for a 
total absolute eﬃciency gain of 0.3% (from 39.5% to 39.8%).

These estimates of eﬃciency gain per p.p. of EGR, 0.064 from 
Szybist and Splitter [84] and 0.11 from Kolodziej et al. [218] , equate 
to an ITE increase of 1.3 to 2.2 p.p. for a 20% EGR condition relative 
to a baseline engine operating condition. This estimate is largely in 
line with the eﬃciency gains of 1 to 1.5 p.p. ITE increase at 20% 
EGR found by Chang and Szybist [83] , Caton [ 79 , 237 ], and Alger et 
al. [80] . 

Eq. 25 can be evaluated with the underlying assumption that a 
relative increase in indicated thermal eﬃciency is equal to the cor- 
responding relative increase in η
b . The measurements by Szybist 
and Splitter [84] provide one estimate:

Since these calculations are in terms of absolute increased en- 
gine eﬃciency, it is necessary to convert to relative eﬃciency gains, 
by  dividing  by  the  eﬃciency  of  the  base  0%  EGR  condition.  For 
the data from Szybist and Splitter [84] , dividing by a base ITE of 
27% and converting to relative percent (multiplying by 100) pro- 
vides  0.179%  relative  ITE  increase  per  centimeter  per  second  in- 
crease in S L . Applying this same approach to the data by Kolodziej 
et al. (2017) [218] , which had a base ITE of 37.2%, provides 0.190% 
relative  ITE  increase  per  centimeter  per  second  increase  in  S L 
Eq. 25 can now be estimated in full: 

The reciprocals of these terms are used to deﬁne the laminar 
ﬂame speed term in the merit function, and the average of the two 
values is used. This yields the following:

3.3.4. Additional laminar ﬂame speed effects 

While strong evidence has been presented that increased fuel 
S L  allows increased SI dilution tolerance and therefore increased 
engine ITE, it is not clear whether the effects of fuel S L are mea- 
surable for  nondilute  stoichiometric SI  combustion.  For  example, 
Heese  et  al.  modeled  ﬂame  speed  impacts  on  eﬃciency  under 
nondilute  operation  for  conditions  that  were  both  knock-limited 
and not knock-limited and found only minor differences ( < 0.2 %) 
with large changes in ﬂame speed ( > 20%) [238] . Remmert et al. 
demonstrated that there was an eﬃciency beneﬁt for higher- S L fu- 
els at a constant spark timing, but it was not clear whether it could 
be adjusted for by matching combustion phasing through differ- 
ent spark timing [239] . For experimental studies, it is not possible 
to change the ﬂame speed in isolation from other fuel properties, 
which  makes  it  diﬃcult  to  deconvolute  the  effects  of  individual 
fuel properties. For example, it is well known that adding ethanol 
to a fuel blend increases its S L (see Broustail et al. ) [240] . However, 
ethanol addition also increases the fuel’s HoV. Increased fuel evap- 
orative cooling reduces in-cylinder gas temperatures and therefore 
also a fuel’s S L , as demonstrated by Szybist and Splitter [84] and 
illustrated in Fig. 33 . 

In  addition  to  lean  stratiﬁed-charge  conditions,  Sjöberg  and 
Reuss investigated nondilute SI combustion with E0 gasoline and 
E85  gasoline  [241] .  The  results  show  that  the  increased  HoV 
of  ethanol  can  counteract  the  inherent  tendency  of  ethanol  to 
increase  S L  for  a  given  charge  temperature.  Rockstroh  et  al. 
[193]  found  that  the  cooler  temperature  with  a  high  HoV  fuel 
(E50, approximately 90 K lower than the non-ethanol fuel) caused 
the combustion duration to be slower despite the higher S L when 
compared at the same temperature. This phenomenon is demon- 
strated in Fig. 34 , with fundamental ﬂame measurements by Zhao 
shown  in  Fig.  34 (a),  and  corresponding  temperature  and  heat- 
release traces for engine experiments with the same fuels shown 
in Fig. 34 (b) and (c). Fig. 34 (a) illustrates that going from a regu- 
lar grade of gasoline without ethanol (RD3–87) to E85 increases S L 
by roughly 14% for stoichiometric conditions, yet Fig. 34 (c) reveals 
that the heat-release rate is invariant with fuel type.

[ 1 , 37 , 190 ]. Although boosted HPD engines are effective at improv- 
ing fuel economy, their increased power density makes them more 
prone  to  damaging  preignition  phenomena  followed  by  super- 
knock, which is a very high-pressure knocking event that can cause 
engine damage. Preignition is a phenomena in which the premixed 
fuel-air mixture is ignited unintentionally prior to the ﬁring of the 
spark plug and can have a number of different causes. In many 
instances, preignition is not destructive [244] . However, in down- 
sized boosted engines, the high-load and typically low-speed op- 
erating conditions result in preignition coupled to intense super- 
knock events referred to as low-speed preignition (LSPI). Despite 
its name, LSPI and superknock have recently been reported during 
an on-road study at engine speeds in excess of 30 0 0 RPM [245] . 
LSPI can be detrimental to engine hardware as the early ignition 
of the fuel-air mixture can lead to heavy knocking or detonation 
events resulting in very high peak pressures and pressure oscilla- 
tions. Fig. 35 provides an illustration of the magnitude of an LSPI 
superknock event that exceeds 300 bar during an engine operating 
condition that normally has a peak pressure of about 50 bar [246] . 
LSPI effectively limits vehicle eﬃciency because it is a barrier to 
further engine downsizing and downspeeding; manufacturers size 
and  calibrate  engines  and  transmission  combinations  for  vehicle 
powertrains to avoid engine operation that is prone to LSPI. 

3.4.1. Causes of low speed preignition 

Chapman et al. [244] explain that, for these damaging events to 
occur, there is a multi-step sequence where each step is required 
but not suﬃcient on its own, as illustrated in Fig. 36 . The ﬁrst step 
is initiation, where an ignition source deposits energy into the fuel 
and air mixture. If this ignition source transfers suﬃcient energy, 
it leads to a preignition where there is ﬂame propagation in the 
combustion chamber prior to spark ignition. The preignition event 
causes compression heating of the end gas, leading to end gas au- 
toignition. Wang et al. [247] conclude that preignition can result in 
a full spectrum of outcomes, including non-knocking cycles, mild 
knock that does not require mitigation, or heavy knock can dam- 
age the engine. It is only if there is suﬃcient coupling of the en- 
ergy release rate with the surrounding thermodynamic conditions 
that will result in a developing detonation to produce superknock 
[248] . 

While the LSPI event and the resulting superknock event are re- 
lated, they are distinct phenomena, and not all LSPI cycles exhibit 
superknock [247] . LSPI occurs stochastically and, under appropri-

ature with increased HoV of E85. (c) Heat-release rate for gasoline and E85. Fuel 
properties are given in Sjöberg and Reuss [241] . 

Farrell  et  al.  [226]  claimed  that  increased  fuel  S L  caused  in- 
creased engine ITE. However, the magnitude of the ITE increase is 
diﬃcult to see solely through a comparison of the rates of heat 
release between the fuels. Ayala and Heywood [243] investigated 
signiﬁcant increases to mixture S L by introducing hydrogen. How- 
ever, no gain in ITE was detected for stoichiometric nondilute SI 
engine  operation.  This  may  be  explained  by  the  relatively  short 
10–90% burn duration of 20 °CA for the baseline gasoline, provid- 
ing near ideal constant-volume combustion even without hydrogen 
addition. 

Thus, for the purposes of quantifying the impact of S L on eﬃ- 
ciency unrelated to dilution tolerance, no conclusive relationships 
could be established based on the examined literature.

ometry). The results illustrated the sensitivities of LSPI to differ- 
ent operating conditions, resulting in strategies to reduce the fre- 
quency  of  preignition  events:  use  of  a  high-volatility  fuel,  fuel 
sprays that target the piston top rather than the cylinder liner, and 
using multiple fuel injections. Fig. 38 illustrates some of the ﬁnd- 
ings  of  that  work  that  highlight instances where increased fuel- 
wall impingement correlated with increased LSPI event count. 

Further studies on fuel properties show that physical proper- 
ties that minimize fuel-wall impingement, speciﬁcally reduced dis- 
tillation temperatures, correlate with reduced LSPI frequency and 
support the fuel-oil ejection theory. For example, Chapman et al. 
illustrate in Fig. 39 that LSPI frequency is correlated with distilla- 
tion T50 (temperature at which 50% of the fuel evaporated) [257] . 
A number of other researchers also showed a linear dependency 
of LSPI frequency on the fraction of fuel that boiled above 150 °C 
[273–275] . 

In addition to the distillation curve, Mansﬁeld et al. noted that 
fuels with high aromatic content were particularly prone to LSPI 
[ 249 , 259 ]. Since the high temperature fraction of gasoline distil- 
lation  tends  to  contain  an  increased  fraction  of  aromatics,  it  is 
diﬃcult  to  separate  the  difference  between  distillation  and  aro- 
matic content on LSPI. It is noteworthy, though, that, in a study 
where  liquid  sample  was  collected  from  the  crevice  region  and 
speciated, the aromatic content at the heavy end of the distillation 
curve preferentially remained in this area [276] . Further,  Splitter 
et al. recently showed that nitro compounds, which can be read- 
ily formed from liquid phase aromatics with elevated temperature 
and pressure and the presence of NOx, are a possible LSPI ignition 
source [277] . Thus, there is evidence supporting that both distilla- 
tion curve and aromatics promote preignition tendency. 

3.4.3. Additional LSPI fuel-effects 

The previous section speciﬁcally focused on fuel effects of LSPI 
initiation, but Fig. 36 illustrates that LSPI is a sequential process, 
and fuel effects can occur at multiple steps in the process. First, 
both Zaccardi and Escudie [250] and Splitter et al. [278] noted the 
importance  of  the  thermodynamic  state  of  the  fuel-air  mixture. 
Splitter et al. [278] showed that fuel-air mixtures that undergo pre- 
spark heat release due to LTHR are highly kinetically active and in- 
crease LSPI tendency. 

Kalghatgi  et  al.  [ 270 , 271 ]  investigated  the  magnitude  of  en- 
ergy input necessary to cause LSPI using a series of surrogate fuel 
formulations and found that fuels with higher S L  had more LSPI 
events. From this, Kalghatgi and Bradley [270] developed a preig- 
nition rating (PR), where a high PR indicates that a fuel is resis- 
tant to LSPI. Fig. 40 illustrates that PR increases with the inverse 
of ﬂame speed. Kalghatgi and Bradley attributed this effect to the 
ﬂame  thickness:  fuels  with  increased  ﬂame  speed  will  have  de- 
creased ﬂame thickness, allowing the ﬂame to more reliably prop- 
agate, similar to ﬂame propagation under dilute combustion dis- 
cussed in Section 3.3 . Rudloff et al. [279] expanded upon this work 
in a modeling study and showed the possibility of high S L  fuels

cycles [249] . However, LSPI can also manifest as a cluster of many 
events that occur in an alternating pattern; wherein, every-other- 
cycle exhibits LSPI behavior. Additionally, though rare, the occur- 
rence of consecutive LSPI cycles has also been reported [249] . 

3.4.2. Fuel-related causes of LSPI initiation 

Fuel  interactions  with  LSPI  and  superknock  are  complex  be- 
cause fuel properties can act to either promote or mitigate any of 
the events in the sequence shown in Fig. 36 , with many studies 
focusing on fuel effects associated with preignition initiation. As 
explained by Zaccardi and Escudie [250] , there can be a number of 
distinct initiation steps for LSPI, such as autoignition in the gaseous 
phase and the ignition of the fuel-air mixture due to either liq- 
uid droplets or solid particles. While a number of researchers have 
shown that ﬂaking deposits or other solids can initiate LSPI events 
[251–253] , Gupta et al. [254] concluded that it would be improb- 
able for those sources to persist over multiple cycles, making this 
cause an unlikely cause of clustered LSPI events. 

A  more  probable  initiation  mechanism  is  droplets  of  fuel  or 
lubricant  ejected  from  the  top-ring  land  of  a  piston,  as  shown 
in Fig. 37 [ 249 , 255 ]. A signiﬁcant amount of recent LSPI research 
on the droplet ejection theory has focused on understanding the 
effects  of  fuel  [256–259]  and  lubricant  [260–267]  properties  as 
well  as  the  interaction  of  fuel  sprays  and  lubricating  oil  in  the 
top crevice region [ 24 9 , 26 8 , 269 ]. Kalghatgi et al. [ 270 , 271 ] noted 
that the ignition source must be highly reactive, more so than n- 
heptane, to successfully produce a preignition event. In addition, 
the stochastic nature of LSPI has also partially been attributed to 
variations  in  piston  ring  motion  [249]  and  cycle-to-cycle  turbu- 
lence variations [272] . 

Zahdeh et al. [249] evaluated an engine’s LSPI frequency with 
hardware conﬁguration (e.g. injector targeting, piston top-ring ge-

leading to developing detonations in strong LSPI events. This work 
showed that fuels with high S L  are more prone to high intensity 
superknock events and not just increased preignition frequency. 

Jatana et al. [246] studied the frequency and severity of LSPI 
as part of the Co-Optima initiative by changing the composition 
of  the  fuel  components  to  vary  S L  while  holding  the  distillation 
curve constant. To accomplish this, three blendstocks were blended 
into a baseline gasoline at 25% mass fraction, with the blendstocks 
having a similar RON (99.5 ± 1.5) and boiling point (131 ± 5 °C). 
This boiling point range was chosen to increase the distillation T50 
temperature  relative  to  the  baseline  gasoline,  which  was  identi- 
ﬁed by Chapman et al. as correlating strongly with LSPI frequency 
[257] . The three blendstocks included a ketone (cyclopentanone), 
an alcohol (2-methyl-1-butanol), and an aromatic (ethylbenzene). 
The study found that, relative to the baseline fuel, all the fuel can- 

didates investigated in this study increase LSPI events signiﬁcantly. 
However,  despite  having  a  similar  number  of  LSPI  events,  there 
was a large difference in LSPI intensity, as is shown by the pres- 
sure rise associated with the LSPI event in Fig. 41 . Speciﬁcally, the 
fuel components with the higher S L , cyclopentanone and 2-methyl- 
1-butanol,  resulted  in  the  most  severe  LSPI  events,  and  the  fuel 
component with the lowest S L , ethylbenezene, resulted in the low- 
est magnitude LSPI events. 

3.4.4. Quantiﬁcation of the fuel-related causes of low-speed 
preignition 

While it is clear from Section 3.4.3 that there are fuel effects 
that extend beyond preignition initiation, the fuel properties that 
affect initiation, discussed in Section 3.4.2 , are the best understood 
and  will  form  the  basis  for  the  quantiﬁcation  of  eﬃciency  im-

pacts discussed here. This section illustrated that LSPI frequency 
increases with both higher aromatic content [ 249 , 259 ] and with 
higher distillation temperature [ 257 , 273–275 ]. While not originally 
intended to apply to LSPI fuel effects, the particulate matter index 
(PMI), which was developed by Aikawa et al. [280] to predict the 
PM formation tendencies of a fuel, is a fuel property metric that 
accounts for both distillation temperature and aromatic content, as 
shown in Eq. 31 

P MI =

where DBE (double bond equivalent) is a structural descriptor of 
each component’s unsaturation (i.e., rings and double bonds) and 
VP is the vapor pressure. Aikawa et al. [280] further explain that 
the vapor pressure and boiling point for the higher boiling point 
species are closely correlated, as shown in Fig. 42 . 

While  PMI  was  not  developed  to  be  predictive  of  LSPI  fre- 
quency, there is evidence to suggest that this fuel property pro- 
vides a superior indication of LSPI frequency than distillation curve 
alone. While PMI data were not originally published by Chapman 
et al. [257] , the LSPI data were obtained from the authors and re- 
evaluated, as shown in Fig. 43 . The correlation between SPI events 
using PMI marginally improved relative to the T50 correlation, in- 
creasing the R 2 correlation coeﬃcient from 0.73 to 0.78. An addi- 
tional study by Swarts et al. [281] investigating LSPI frequency for 

17 different fuels again showed a strong correlation to PMI, but the 
PMI correlation only held for LSPI frequency and not severity. 

Thus, for the purpose of attempting to quantify the effects of 
LSPI on engine eﬃciency, PMI will be used as a fuel property in- 
dicator of LSPI frequency. As shown in Fig. 43 , this is an imperfect 
indicator, but this is to be expected given that LSPI occurrence, and 
ultimately superknock, is a series of events where fuel properties 
can affect the outcome in multiple different ways in the sequence, 
as was shown in Fig. 36 . 

The next step is to quantify the impact of LSPI frequency on en- 
gine eﬃciency. As noted at the beginning of Section 3.4 , LSPI limits 
the degree of engine downsizing. Downsizing and downspeeding 
with high power density engines has been a widespread trend in 
the automotive industry, as evidenced by the trend since 2005 to- 
wards engines with fewer cylinders as shown in Fig. 4 . Further, in 
Section 3.1.5 , the engine eﬃciency increase associated with an in- 
crease in OI incorporated a downsizing multiplier, which was then 
extended to the ﬁrst HoV term associated with knock mitigation. 
For  the  purposes  of  quantifying  the  effects  of  LSPI  on  eﬃciency 
with the merit function, this downsizing multiplier will be elimi- 
LSPI,crit ) value where LSPI 
nated above a critical threshold PMI (PMI 
is prone to occur. 

Thus,  the  terms  in  Eqs.  (15 )  and  (22)  can  be  combined  into 
Eq. 32 to show the net impact of improved knock resistance on en- 
gine eﬃciency. This Eq. also incorporates the limitation on down- 
sizing imposed by LSPI for fuels with PMI > PMI 
LSPI,crit . This control 

34

term is based on the Heaviside function, H (x), which is a form of 
step function between zero and one. In this case, the presumptions 
LSPI,crit , the downsizing eﬃciency multiplier ap- 
are that below PMI 
plies, but above this value, LSPI is too prevalent and prevents fur- 
ther downsizing.. While this analysis provides a structure of how 
this term will be incorporated, the quantiﬁcation of PMI 
LSPI,crit for 
LSPI to occur still needs to be done, and it may be different for 
different engine designs.

necessary  to  meet  emissions  regulations,  they  also  incur  a  fuel 
penalty  since  the  engine  is  purposefully  operated  at  abnormally 
low-eﬃciency conditions during the cold start process [283–286] . 
The  magnitude  of  the  fuel  penalty  will  depend  on  how  long  it 
takes for the catalyst to achieve light-off: higher light-off temper- 
atures will require more time under the cold-start strategy, result- 
ing in a larger fuel penalty. The cold-start fuel penalty provides a 
means for linking emissions with engine eﬃciency.

4. How fuels inﬂuence eﬃciency through emission controls 

Section 3 focused on in-cylinder impacts, which are the most 
direct ways fuel properties affect engine eﬃciency, and ultimately 
vehicle  fuel  consumption.  However,  all  vehicles  sold  must  meet 
emissions  standards,  and  fuels  can  inﬂuence  the  emissions  pro- 
duced by the engine in either a positive or negative way. In this 
section, the ways in which fuel properties affect emissions from 
stoichiometric SI engines are discussed, and then the effect of dif- 
ferences in emissions on fuel eﬃciency is quantiﬁed. This is done 
ﬁrst for gaseous emissions in Section 4.1 and then for particulate 
matter (PM) emissions in Section 4.2 . 

4.1. Gaseous emissions 

4.1.1. Derivation of the gaseous emissions merit function term 

The motivation and derivation for the gaseous emissions merit 
function  term,  including  detailed  discussions  of  the  assumptions 
and  data  analysis  methods  used  in  numerical  evaluation  of  the 
merit function term, have been described elsewhere [282] . A brief 
summary of that work is included in this section. Note that some 
of the variables used in that analysis have been updated from ref- 
erence [282] to match the conventions used in other parts of this 
review. 

All  vehicles  sold  in  the  United  States  must  comply  with  US 
EPA emissions regulations for three classes of gaseous emissions: 
CO, NOx, and nonmethane organic gases (NMOG). To comply with 
these regulations, all modern SI vehicle engines sold in the United 
States operate with a nominally stoichiometric AFR to enable the 
use of TWCs for exhaust aftertreatment. As discussed in Section 1 , 
TWCs  are  extremely  effective  at  removing  CO,  NOx,  and  NMOG 
from  the  exhaust  of  a  properly  calibrated  engine/emissions  con- 
trol  system  at  typical  SI  engine  exhaust  temperatures.  However, 
TWCs do not work effectively when they are at ambient temper- 
atures. The TWC temperature must be above a certain threshold, 
commonly  referred  to  as  the  “light-off temperature,” before  the 
catalytic oxidation/reduction reactions required to convert the reg- 
2 O  become  active.  Thus,  the 
2 ,  and  H 
ulated  pollutants  to  N 
majority of the regulated pollutants emitted by modern vehicles 
equipped with SI engines are released during the cold start period 
immediately after the engine is turned on [282] . This can be ob- 
served in emissions data collected during the US EPA Federal Test 
Procedure (FTP) city driving cycle, such as in Fig. 44 . Most emis- 
sions (60% of CO; 80% of HCs, equivalent to NMOG in this case, 
and 60% of NOx) occur during the ﬁrst 120 s of the cycle, before 
the catalyst achieves light-off. Once the catalyst is hot, the gaseous 
emissions are quite low for the remainder of the FTP cycle. 

2 ,  CO 

To comply with emissions standards, engine operation during 
cold start must be carefully controlled to heat the TWC above the 
light-off temperature as quickly as possible. Methods for catalyst 
heating  include  operation  with  excess  fuel  and  air  and  delayed 
spark timing, creating hot chemically reactive exhaust to rapidly 
increase  TWC  temperature  [283–285] .  While  such  strategies  are 

Data from the EPA FTP city driving cycle provides one method 
for  estimating  the  fuel  penalty  associated  with  catalyst  heating 
during cold-start operation. The FTP is broken into three sections, 
also known as “bags” 1, 2 and 3, as shown in Fig. 44 . Since the 
engine  and  emissions  control  catalysts  are  at  ambient  tempera- 
ture at the beginning of the test, the ﬁrst section begins with a 
cold start. The third section is identical to the ﬁrst, except for one 
important detail: the engine and emissions control catalysts begin 
at elevated temperatures since it is run shortly after the second 
section is completed. The third section is therefore considered a 
“hot” start. The calculations for fuel economy and emissions mea- 
surements actually include a fourth section with the same speed 
and  load  proﬁle  as  the  second,  but  since  the  fuel  consumption 
and emissions for the second and fourth sections are so similar, in 
practice fuel economy calculations multiply the second section fuel 
consumption by two to reduce testing time. The total fuel energy 
consumed is calculated according to the following formula: 

Q tot = Q 1 + 2 Q 2 + Q 3 

(33) 

Note that this formula is not strictly accurate, as the US EPA 
regulations in fact weight the fuel consumed during Sections 3 and 
4  slightly  higher  than  the  fuel  from  Sections  1  and  2 .  However, 
the relative weighting factors are not large enough to signiﬁcantly 
impact the analysis laid out in this section. 

Comparing the total fuel consumed during the ﬁrst and third 
sections of the FTP allows for calculation of (cid:3)Q LO , the fuel penalty 
during cold start: 
(cid:3)Q LO = Q 1 − Q 3 

(34) 

The  increased  fuel  consumption  during  cold  start  is  not  en- 
tirely caused by the catalyst heating strategy; higher friction due 
to cold vehicle components and lubricants also contributes to the 
cold  start  fuel  penalty  [282] .  However,  there  have  not  been  de- 
tailed analyses of the relative contributions of catalyst heating and 
friction published in the open literature, so for this analysis it is as- 
sumed that all of the cold start fuel penalty prior to catalyst light- 
off (roughly 120 sec) is due to the catalyst heating strategy [282] . 
Substituting the expression for cold start penalty into the formula 
for total fuel consumed during the FTP cycle gives: 
Q tot = (cid:3)Q LO + 2 Q 2 + 2 Q 3 

(35) 

Next,  (cid:3)q 

LO is  deﬁned  as  the  average  difference  between  the 
cold-start fuel consumption rate and the hot-start fuel consump- 
tion rate, which is calculated by dividing the total fuel penalty dur- 
ing cold start ( (cid:3)Q LO ) by the time to achieve catalyst light-off ( t LO ):

Changing the fuel composition will change the composition and 
concentration of the unburned and partially burned organic gases 
emitted  from  the  engine.  Since  different  organic  gases  can  have 
different catalytic reactivities, changing fuel composition can raise 
or lower the light-off temperature of the TWC. Shifting the light- 
off temperature would change the time required to reach light-off,

et al. [282] with permission of SAE International. 

and,  therefore,  the  fuel  penalty  associated  with  catalyst  heating. 
Note  that  a  reduced  light-off temperature  could  be  leveraged to 
provide several different beneﬁts to an automaker: the aforemen- 
tioned reduced catalyst heating fuel penalty, lower overall emis- 
sions, lower cost emissions control catalysts, or some combination 
of all of these beneﬁts. Predicting how automakers would actually 
make use of a lower light-off temperature is beyond the scope of 
this analysis. Since the intent of this section is to link emissions 
control performance back to the merit function, which is based on 
fuel eﬃciency, it is assumed that a reduced light-off temperature 
would be used to decrease the fuel penalty for catalyst heating. 

To obtain an expression relating the time to light-off with the 
light-off temperature, we start with the observation that the cat- 
alyst  temperature  continuously  increases  with  time  during  cold 
start[284] from ambient temperature, T 
amb , to the light-off temper- 
ature T c,90 . If α is deﬁned as the average catalyst heating rate: 

α = 

T c, 90 − T

(37) 

then the time to light-off can be calculated from the catalyst light- 
off temperature: 

t LO =

( T c, 90 − T

(38) 

Substituting Eq. 38 into Eq. 36 yields the following expression 

for the light-off fuel penalty:

and the total fuel consumed during the FTP can be calculated from:

Note that this derivation relies on the fact that the total amount

hicle, as the test protocol deﬁnes the speed/load proﬁle. Substitut- 
ing the expression for Q tot that was derived above yields:

Since catalyst light-off temperature will depend on the catalyst 
formulation and catalyst age in addition to the fuel composition, it 
is important to normalize for these effects. Thus, the change in ef- 
ﬁciency with catalyst light-off temperature for a new fuel mixture 
should be evaluated relative to the light-off temperature of a base- 
line fuel over the same catalyst. Evaluation of Eq. 43 for two fuels 
(designated as “conv” for conventional and “mix” for a new fuel 
mixture) yields the ﬁnal Eq. for the catalyst light-off merit func- 
tion term:

To place the cold start fuel penalty in the same functional form

Evaluation of the heating rate term requires the light-off time 
(120 s)  as  well  as  the  difference  between  the  light-off tempera- 
ture and ambient temperature. Ambient temperature for the FTP 
test is 25 °C. TWC light-off temperature will depend on catalyst 
formulation,  catalyst  age,  and  fuel  composition.  Typical  gasoline 
constituents light-off between 250 °C and 300 °C under realistic 
exhaust mixtures over commercially relevant TWCs. The light-off
curve for an E10 surrogate measured in a synthetic exhaust ﬂow 
reactor over an aged commercial TWC is shown in Fig. 46 . 

Based  on  the  analysis  and  assumptions  described  above,  and 
detailed  by  Pihl  et  al.  [282] ,  the  merit  function  term  associated 
with gaseous emissions control simpliﬁes to a difference between 
the  catalytic  light-off temperatures  of  a  candidate  fuel  ( T 
c,90,mix ) 
and a conventional fuel ( T c,90,conv ). The light-off temperatures for 
candidate fuels can be measured through several different meth- 
ods. A method using synthetic exhaust ﬂow reactor experiments 
is described by Majumdar et al. [289] . Fig. 47 shows the light-off
temperatures  for  a  wide  range  of  both  conventional  and  poten- 
tial high-performance biomass-derived fuel constituents. Measure- 
ments such as these can be used to evaluate the gaseous emissions 
merit function term. 

4.2. Particulate Emissions 

The  combustion  of  fuel  in  engines  produces  PM,  a  regulated 
pollutant that can be both physically and chemically heterogeneous 
material. It may consist of soot (i.e. black carbon or elemental car- 
bon,  which  is  referred  to  here  as  PM soot ),  unburned  or  partially 
oxidized hydrocarbons (i.e. organic carbon), and/or ash (inorganic 
material) [290] . 

4.2.1. PM emissions regulations 

Light-duty gasoline DI vehicles have been in commercial pro- 
duction since the late 1990s [ 188 , 291 ] and, in 2016, reached 50% 
of new market share for passenger cars in the US ﬂeet. Gasoline DI 
engines tend to produce more PM on a mass basis than their PFI 
counterparts [292–296] ; PM levels of early gasoline DI vehicles ex- 
ceeded those of diesels equipped with diesel particulate ﬁlters and 
conventional PFI vehicles [297] . Because of the impact of mobile 
sources on air quality, any large-scale change in engine technology 
and fuel may have far-reaching effects. As ambient air standards 
for ﬁne PM decrease, direct emissions of PM from gasoline DI ve- 
hicles may affect the air quality attainment status of some regions. 
Regulation of PM from US mobile sources began in the 1980s as 
part of the Tier 0 emission standards and continued with stricter 
emission  standards  under  the  Tier  1  regulation,  which  started 
phase-in with model year 1994 [298] . While both Tier 0 and Tier 
1 passenger vehicle emission standards were applied to all light- 
duty vehicles regardless of fuel, there was an exclusion in which 
the PM emission standard was only applicable to diesel vehicles 
[298] . However, this was not the case with the Tier 2 PM emis- 
sion standards for passenger vehicles that were phased in between 
model years 2004 and 2009. All Tier 2 gasoline light-duty vehi- 
cles were required to meet a 10 mg/mile PM standard over the FTP 
drive  cycle,  at  a  full  useful  life  of  120,0 0 0  miles,  and  on  an  in- 
dividual vehicle basis rather than a ﬂeet average basis [ 299 , 300 ]. 
Limited data are available on PM emissions from vehicles certiﬁed 
under the Tier 2 standards due to a waiver of PM emission testing

requirements [299] . This testing waiver was not extended to EPA’s 
Tier 3 PM regulation, which applies to all vehicles, phases in be- 
tween 2017 and 2020, and has a limit of 3 mg/mile over the FTP 
drive cycle [301] . California’s Air Resources Board (CARB) plans to 
phase in a stricter LEV III regulation of 1 mg/mile between model 
years 2025 and 2028 [302] . Historically, EPA often follows CARB’s 
lead on emission regulations. Therefore, if PM regulations follow 
historical trends, the EPA may adopt the 1 mg/mile standard some- 
time after 2025. Thus, the 1 mg/mile PM standard will be used as 
a basis for evaluating the PM Control term for the merit function. 
In  Europe,  there  has  been  additional  concern  about  particle 
number (PN) emissions from mobile sources. The Euro 6 standards, 
which were implemented beginning in 2015 [303] , were widely re- 
garded as a technology-forcing regulation for diesel vehicles due to 
the incorporation of a PN standard. Previously, many heavy-duty 
and light-duty diesel vehicles had used in-cylinder methods such 

as advanced timing and high-pressure injection to control PM to 
below the standard and then applied aftertreatment to meet the 
NOx standard. The Euro 6b regulation speciﬁed that PN emissions 
> 23 nm in diameter must be below 6 × 10 12 particle #/km as mea- 
sured by the Particulate Measurement Protocol by 2016, and then 
6 × 10 11  #/km  by  2019  (Euro  6c)  [303] .  Of  particular  interest  to 
this analysis, the PN standard only applies to diesel-fueled vehicles 
and gasoline-fueled vehicles equipped with DI engines. Researchers 
[304–306]  have  seen  a  strong  correlation  between  PN  and  PM 
mass for solid particles (e.g. 2 × 10 12 #/mg [306] ) and found that 
the newest Euro 6 b, c, and d PN standard of 6 × 10 11 #/km rep- 
resents  about  one  order-of-magnitude  lower  PM  mass  emissions 
than  the  Euro  6  b,  c,  and  d  PM  mass  standard  requires  (0.3 vs. 
4.5 mg/km). Therefore, for a vehicle to meet the PN standard, its 
PM mass must be an order-of-magnitude less than is required by 
the current PM mass standard.

4.2.2. Methods for controlling PM Emissions from gasoline DI Engines 
There  are  two  predominant  pathways  to  complying  with  PM 
and/or PN emissions regulations: using a gasoline particulate ﬁl- 
ter (GPF) and reducing the generation of particles in-cylinder. PM 
ﬁltration  technology  has  proven  to  be  an  effective  means  to  re- 
move particles from the exhaust for diesel engines, with Platt et 
al. reported that the PM emissions from diesel vehicles equipped 
with  PM  ﬁlters  are  signiﬁcantly  lower  than  gasoline  DI  vehicles 
that  do  not  use  GPFs.  GPF  technologies  are  currently  being  de- 
ployed in both Europe and China as a way to reduce PM emissions 
from SI engines, and vehicles using GPFs to comply with PN reg- 
ulations emit orders of magnitude lower particles than allowed by 
the regulations [307] . Thus, it is clear that GPFs are a highly ef- 
fective technology that is rapidly maturing, and will continue to 
be considered as a method to achieve PM mass and PN emissions 
compliance with the increasingly stringent standards motivated by 
PM health concerns [308] . However, as will be discussed and quan- 
tiﬁed in Section 4.2.4 , a GPF introduces backpressure on the en- 
gine, creating a thermodynamic penalty. Thus, if it can be avoided, 
a GPF is not the preferred route for PM emissions control. 

A second way to control PM emissions is to improve combus- 
tion system performance through better fuel-air mixture prepara- 
tion. PFI engines generally have lower PM emissions than gasoline 
DI  engines  because  more  time  is  available  for  evaporation.  Fur- 
thermore, the DI spray can contact combustion chamber surfaces 
under some conditions, which inhibits fuel evaporation, whereas 
PFI  spray  typically  has  reduced  interaction  with  the  combustion 
chamber surfaces. Continued development of gasoline DI combus- 
tion systems is reducing PM emissions, and the improvements will 
probably allow most vehicle manufacturers to meet EPA’s PM reg- 
ulation  of  3 mg/mile  without  a  GPF.  A  recent  technology  assess- 
ment by CARB predicts that vehicle manufacturers will meet their 
1 mg/mile PM regulation primarily through improved combustion 
systems [309] . Minimizing PM formation in gasoline DI engines de- 
pends primarily on avoiding liquid fuel deposition on combustion 
chamber surfaces and on achieving rapid spray breakup, evapora- 
tion and air mixing. Examples of technology improvements toward 
these objectives include: 

• piezoelectric  injectors  that  allow  multiple,  shorter  injections, 
which reduce spray penetration length and spray impingement 
on combustion chamber surfaces [310] ; 

• intake ports and combustion chambers designed for better mix- 

ing that further reduce spray impingement; 

• higher  fuel  pressures  coupled  with  injector  nozzles  that  im- 
prove spray breakup and resist deposit formation [ 311 , 312 ]; and 
• dual injection systems that feature both direct and port injec- 
tors, which enable more ﬂexible engine calibrations to reduce 
PM  emissions  under  conditions  where  DI  injectors  alone  are 
challenged, such as cold start and acceleration [313–315] . 

Higher injection pressures may reduce PM formation, but they 
can also reduce engine eﬃciency due to increased parasitic losses. 
For  instance,  Husted  et  al.  [316]  estimated  an  associated  fuel- 
economy penalty of roughly 0.4% on the new European driving cy- 
cle if the injection pressure was increased from 100 bar to 400 bar 
across the speed and load range. However, for a more optimal im- 
plementation (and to reduce the fuel penalty), the fuel pressure 
would be modulated for operating conditions that do not require 
high fuel mass ﬂow rates and/or enhanced spray breakup. 

4.2.3. Fuel effects on PM emissions 

A third way to reduce PM emissions is through improved fuel 
properties  and  fuel  chemistry.  The  PMI  of  gasoline,  previously 
shown in Eq. 31 , has been shown to correlate well with PM mass 
and  PN  emissions  trends  in  PFI  engines  as  well  as  DI  engines 
[ 280 , 317 ]. Depending on the regulatory transient drive cycle, PM 

emissions  can  increase  several  times  over  for  a  unit  increase  in 
PMI.  PMI  is  based  on  the  detailed  hydrocarbon  analysis  of  the 
gasoline, from which two properties of the individual components 
(DBE and VP) are applied and summed to calculate PMI [280] . It is 
noteworthy that, since PMI was ﬁrst developed, a modiﬁcation to 
the detailed hydrocarbon analysis method has been developed as 
a way to provide more resolution to the heavy end of the gasoline 
boiling range to provide more accurate PMI numbers [318] . 

DBE  is  intended  to  capture  the  tendency  of  highly  unsatu- 
rated compounds such as aromatics to form more soot than satu- 
rated compounds such as alkanes. In the PMI calculation, shown in 
Eq. 31 , DBE + 1 is used as the intrinsic chemical sooting tendency 
of the molecule – arbitrarily assigning a value of 1 to all normal 
and iso-alkanes. The VP, computed at 443 K for each component, 
represents the tendency of less volatile compounds to resist evap- 
oration and therefore experience rich combustion that forms soot. 
However, while PMI has shown good correlation with PM emis- 
sions for a range of commercial gasolines [293] , the presence of 
oxygen in the fuel can affect the tendency of the fuel to make PM. 
A  recent  study  by  Barrientos  et  al.  [319]  compared  PMI  with 
other indices of fuel PM potential. These included Threshold Soot- 
ing Index and Oxygen Extended Sooting Index, using one set of fu- 
els reported by Aikawa et al. [280] , as well as a series of gasoline 
blends with ethanol, n-butanol, and isobutanol. The general ﬁnd- 
ing was that none of the alternative indices improved upon PMI 
for the prediction of PM emissions over various vehicle test cycles. 
Another study, by Ratcliff et al. [320] , used a wider range of oxy- 
genates blended into gasoline and showed that the PMI model can 
break-down in cases of (1) oxygenates with facile routes to soot 
not available to hydrocarbons (underpredicted PM soot ) and (2) oxy- 
genates with very low vapor pressure (overpredicted PM soot ). Com- 
bustion of low-vapor-pressure hydrocarbons may similarly lead to 
overpredicted PM, and the hypothesized mechanism would involve 
substantially  incomplete  evaporation,  leading  to  dissolution  into 
the lube oil, or potentially carbonaceous deposits in the combus- 
tion chamber. 

Research with a single-cylinder gasoline DI engine using a full 
factorial design fuel matrix [321] suggests there is a vapor pres- 
sure threshold for aromatic hydrocarbons, below which they can 
produce signiﬁcant increases in PM emissions when the fuel blend 
also  contains  ethanol  and  at  injection  timing  intended  to  cause 
spray impingement on the piston. However, ethanol blending also 
dilutes aromatics in gasoline on a molar basis, even when aromat- 
ics are held volumetrically constant, as was the case in reference 
[321] .  Molar  dilution  occurs  because  ethanol’s  molecular  weight 
(46) is approximately half the averaged molecular weight of gaso- 
line, and only 31% to 38% that of the aromatics used in this study. 
Thus,  the  effects  on  aromatic  vapor  pressure  and  aromatic  dilu- 
tion from ethanol blending are in competition. For example, Fig. 48 
shows that, at 2500 rpm and 13 bar IMEP n , blends of E30 contain- 
ing  10  or  20 vol  %  of  low-vapor-pressure  4-t-butyltoluene  (VP  @ 
443 K = 58 kPa) in gasoline produced signiﬁcant increases in PM soot 
relative to the matching blends having no ethanol. In contrast, for 
similar blends containing 10 or 20 vol % of the more volatile aro- 
matic cumene (iso-propylbenzene; VP @ 443 K = 152 kPa), the dilu- 
tion effect of ethanol prevailed, resulting in slightly lower or equiv- 
alent PM soot emissions from the E30 blends. Thus, cumene appears 
to be above the vapor pressure threshold for ethanol to negatively 
affect PM soot , while 4-t-butyltoluene is below the vapor pressure 
threshold. PM mass in Fig. 48 is PM soot , as measured by an AVL 
Microsoot Sensor (MSS). 

Across  the  designed  fuel  matrix,  PMI  was  poorly  predictive 
of  PM  emissions with an adjusted  R 2  ranging from  0.53 to  0.74 
for  different  engine  test  conditions.  Characterization  of  the  fuel 
blends by the advanced distillation curve method [322] revealed 
that ethanol blending suppressed the evaporation of aromatic hy-

al. [321] . PM soot measured by an AVL Microsoot sensor (MSS). 

drocarbons in gasoline until all the ethanol evaporated [ 323 , 324 ]. 
The aromatic concentration effect was also observed in fuel spray 
droplet  evaporation  simulations  under  engine-relevant  tempera- 
ture and pressure conditions. The models also demonstrated that 
ethanol blending signiﬁcantly reduced the droplet temperature be- 
cause  of  ethanol’s  higher  HoV,  prolonging  droplet  lifetime.  The 
increased  PM  emissions  that  were  observed  for  the  E30 + 4-t- 
butyltoluene blends can be attributed to the combined effects of 
suppression of aromatic vaporization and longer droplet lifetimes, 
in conjunction with postulated increased fuel spray impingement. 
These distillation and droplet evaporation results suggested some 
nonlinear  interactions  between  ethanol  and  the  aromatics.  The 
LASSO method [325] was used to identify two predominant com- 
bined variable terms, shown in this Eq.: 

P M = X 1 + X 2 ∗ [ ( EtOH% ∗ Aro% ) /AroV P @443 K ] 
+ X 3 ∗ [ ( AroY SI ∗ Aro% ) /AroMW ] 

(48) 

where  ethanol  ( EtOH )  and  aromatic  ( Aro )  concentrations  are  in 
mole percent, 

VP@443 K is the vapor pressure at 443 K, 
YSI is the yield sooting index, and 
MW is the molecular weight. 
YSI is a metric  for the  intrinsic soot-forming tendency  of in- 
dividual fuel molecules, as measured by color pyrometry for low 
concentration,  constant-mole-fraction  blends  of  the  molecules  in 
a  methane/air  ﬂame  [326] .  The  ﬁrst  combined  variable  term  in 
Eq.  48  represents  the  delaying  effects  on  aromatic  evaporation 
caused by ethanol blending and aromatic vapor pressure; the sec- 
ond combined variable term reﬂects the kinetic tendency of the 
aromatic to form soot. Using this regularized regression model re- 
sults in an adjusted R 2 of 0.96 for predicting PM from the fuel ma- 
trix [321] . More research is required to incorporate these improved 
terms into a generalized model such as PMI. Therefore, the merit 
function developed in this work continues to rely upon the PMI 
model as the most established approach currently available. 

The PM emissions from several different fuel blends, including 
the Co-Optima core fuels described in Section 3 [144] , were mea- 
sured as part of the Co-Optima initiative. Steady-state conditions 
were  employed,  and  exhaust  PM soot  was  measured  with  an  AVL 
model 415S smoke-meter, which reports both native Filter Smoke

Smoke Number) corresponding to the engine tests reported in Vuilleumier et al. 
[171] . 

Number as well as PM soot  concentrations calculated from the ﬁl- 
ter blackening using a built-in correlation that assumes a constant 
relationship  between  optical  properties  and  PM soot  regardless  of 
the fuel used. The emissions trends, both in terms of PM soot  and 
smoke, are plotted in Fig. 49 . To ﬁrst order, the data show a linear 
relationship between PMI and PM soot for these steady-state condi- 
tions. 

Because cold start accounts for much of the total PM emitted 
by gasoline DI vehicles during the FTP [ 297 , 327 ], cold-start PM 
emissions were examined as part of the Co-Optima initiative for 
a fuel matrix that included the Co-Optima core fuels discussed in 
Section 3 [144] as well as six blends based on the same blendstock 
for oxygenate blending (BOB) that was used to make E30 
Co-Optima . 
Co-Optima BOB included the BOB by 
The six blends based on the E30 
itself,  the  BOB  with  10 vol  %  EtOH  (E10),  E30 
Co-Optima ,  and  three 
blends  that  contained  the  BOB  with  10 vol  %  EtOH + 20 vol  %  of 
other oxygenates (total 30 vol % oxygenate). Fig. 50 shows the for- 
mulation  of  each  fuel  and  the  chemical  structures  of  the  oxy- 
genates studied. For comparison, a US Tier III regular grade cer- 
tiﬁcation E10 fuel was also studied. 

Cold-start behavior was studied using a reproducible 90 s cold- 
start idle transient run on an engine start-cart that included a 2012

4.2.4. Particulate matter impact on engine thermodynamics 

Adding a GPF to the exhaust system can degrade SI engine ef- 
ﬁciency  because  a  GPF  increases  back  pressure,  which  increases 
pumping work. Increased back pressure could also require spark 
retard  or  lower  r c ,  both  of  which  would  decrease  eﬃciency,  to 
compensate for an increased knock propensity due to an increase 

J.P. Szybist, S. Busch and R.L. McCormick et al. / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 82 (2021) 100876 

41 

in trapped residuals. However, recent studies indicate that the im- 
pact of a GPF on vehicle fuel consumption over regulatory drive cy- 
cles is minor [329–332] . Yang et al. showed that there was no sta- 
tistically signiﬁcant difference [333] . Thus, the effects of increased 
back pressure and more frequent application of spark retard may 
be tempered by the fact that most drive cycles include substantial 
operating time at conditions of low exhaust ﬂow rate that are not 
knock-limited. 

As  discussed  in  Section  4.2.2 ,  there  is  currently  a  signiﬁcant 
amount  of  uncertainty  whether  compliance  with  PM  emissions 
regulations will necessitate using a GPF. There could be different 
regional outcomes, where they are used in some countries or re- 
gions  and  not  others,  depending  on  regulations.  As  discussed  in 
Section 4.2.3 , Eq. 48 improved PM emissions predictions compared 
to PMI ( Eq. 31 ) by including terms for YSI and the interactions be- 
tween ethanol and aromatics. However, Eq. 48 is based on a study 
with  single  speciﬁc  aromatics  blended  into  an  otherwise  highly 
paraﬃnic  gasoline  and  were  investigated  under  a  speciﬁc  set  of 
engine operating conditions. Therefore, its present form does not 
have the general utility of PMI, which sums relevant property val- 
ues from each gasoline component. Consequently, PMI is used here 
to  predict  PM  effect  on  engine  eﬃciency  in  the  merit  function. 
This  section  develops  a  framework  to  account  for  the  effect  of 
fuel properties, speciﬁcally PMI ( Eq. 31 ), on engine thermodynam- 
ics and assumes that there is a threshold value of PMI over which 
a GPF will be required. 

The  presence  of  a  GPF—as  well  as  the  degree  to  which  it  is 
loaded with PM—increases the exhaust back pressure and thereby 
decreases ηGE . The increased back pressure also increases the mass 
of hot residual gas retained in the cylinder after the exhaust stroke. 
The increased hot residual gas increases the engine’s propensity for 
knocking, which would likely require retarded spark timing (de- 
creased  σ
ideal )  or,  in  extreme  cases,  a  decrease  in  r c  (decreased 
η
ideal ). The trend of the PM soot  generation propensity for a given 
set  of  fuels  is  reasonably  well  captured  by  PMI  [280] ,  although 
more robust properties are being developed. Since the effect of PM 
on eﬃciency depends on whether a GPF is installed on the engine, 
it is assumed that a GPF will be necessary when the fuel’s PMI 
exceeds some threshold value. These effects and relationships are 
described by the following Eq.:

Eq. 49 does not consider any fuel economy penalty associated 

with engine operation to regenerate the particulate ﬁlter. 

At this time, no deﬁnitive study has been identiﬁed from which 
we  can  conclude  or  deduce  that  current  technology  DI  vehicles, 
tested with gasoline having a PMI greater than a given threshold, 
will require a GPF to meet a given emission regulation. The lim- 
ited data available [ 280 , 317 ] suggest that a very low PMI of about 
1 is required for a DI vehicle to meet 1 mg/mile of PM without a 
GPF with current production technology. Given that almost no re- 
tail gasolines have PMI values that low [280] , we might conclude 
that all vehicles will require a GPF. However, the referenced studies 
used early DI technology and engine manufacturers are continuing 
to improve the combustion systems to minimize PM formation. 

Similar to the fuel effect on LSPI, the PM Control term in the 
merit  function  is  also  based  on  the  Heaviside  function,  H (x).  In 
this case, the presumptions are that, given a PM emission regula- 
tory target and some state of DI combustion system development 
to control PM, a fuel property that quantiﬁes soot-forming poten- 
tial can be used to trigger the step function. The PM Control merit 

function term is

where the fuel property PMI is the step function trigger. If PMI < 
1.6, then H (x) = 0, meaning that no GPF is required and engine ef- 
ﬁciency  is  not  degraded.  If  PMI  ≥ 1.6,  then  H (x) = 1  and  engine 
eﬃciency  is  degraded  by  the  amount  dictated  by  the  other  fac- 
tors in the PM Control term. Because certiﬁcation gasoline is used 
to determine compliance with emission regulations, the literature 
was surveyed for PMI data of these fuels. PMI values for certiﬁca- 
tion gasolines range from about 1.4–1.8 [ 280 , 309 , 317 ], from which 
the mid-point value of 1.6 was selected. Furthermore, 1.6 is in the 
same PMI range for the soot measurements from the Co-Optima 
cold-start idle transient study that correlates to an EPA FTP equiv- 
alent of 1 mg/mile (see Table 4 ) [328] . However, there is a signif- 
icant amount of uncertainty about both future emissions regula- 
tions around the world and the potential of future engine tech- 
nologies to reduce PM emissions. Thus, it is best to consider the 
PM control merit function term in Eq. 50 as a framework where 
the threshold value of 1.6 can be updated based on PM emission 
Ref in 
regulations and engine technology. Note that the value of PMI 
Eq. 50 refers to the PMI of the merit function’s baseline gasoline 
(shown in Section 5 , Table 5 ) and is distinct from the PMI value 
that is the Heaviside step function trigger. 

The other factors in the PM control term represent a 0.7% en- 
gine eﬃciency loss from increased back pressure of the GPF (in- 
cluding some lifetime averaged loading of ash) and an additional 
0.5% eﬃciency loss per unit increase in PMI from increased back 
pressure arising from fuels with PMIs higher than that of the merit 
function’s baseline fuel, which has the value of 1.4 (see Table 5 ). 
The analysis of Mamakos et al. [332] concluded that, over a ve- 
hicle’s lifetime, higher back pressure from the GPF increases fuel 
consumption by 0.5% to 1.5%, plus 0.17% for GPF regeneration, sum- 
ming to a 0.67% increase in fuel consumption. A study by Mikulic 
et al. [334] reported fuel consumption increases of 2% to 3% at high 
vehicle speeds. A more recent report by Lambert et al. showed that 
exhaust ﬂow rates of 600 kg/h resulted in back pressures ranging 
from  ∼12  to  42 kPa  over  a  variety  of  fresh  and  dyno-aged  GPFs 

during clean ﬁltration; however, engine eﬃciencies were not re- 
ported as part of that study [335] . Until more data and analyses 
are available, we attempt to make a conservative assumption that 
ash-loaded GPF back pressure will reduce engine eﬃciency by 0.7% 
[336] . An eﬃciency loss for GPF regeneration is not explicitly in- 
cluded because previous studies have shown that regeneration oc- 
curs passively during periods of deceleration, when fuel cutoff and 
throttle control can be used to elevate the oxygen concentration 
for burning out soot in the GPF [337] . 

5. The merit function 

The purpose of the merit  function is to assess the combined 
ability of a set of fuel properties to improve eﬃciency relative to 
a baseline fuel representative of a current “regular” grade gasoline. 
Initially presented in a US Department of Energy report [139] , the 
merit function is the summation of the individual fuel property ef- 
fects on eﬃciency, as discussed in the previous sections, normal- 
ized to a relative eﬃciency improvement. That is, a merit function 
score of 10 indicates the potential for 10% more work output for a 
given amount of fuel energy in an optimized engine relative to the 
baseline fuel (or, an 9.1% decrease in fuel consumption for a given

While the merit function provides a tool to assess the eﬃciency 
potential of individual fuel properties in an SI engine, the merit 
function  needs  to  be  exercised  to  provide  insights  about  which 
fuel properties have the largest effect on eﬃciency and which fu- 
els provide those properties. In this section, the fuel properties will 
be assessed ﬁrst through a sensitivity analysis over realistic fuel 
property ranges, and then with blends with potential alternative 
gasoline-range fuel components. 

5.1. Realistic fuel property ranges for the sensitivity analysis 

In order to assess the ranges of fuel properties of interest, we 
must ﬁrst quantify realistic ranges of fuel property variability. For 
the purposes of the sensitivity analysis, the ranges of properties 
considered primarily consist of limiting the blend concentration of 

the  sensitivity  plots  for  “E85” is  included,  assuming  the  ethanol 
concentration  is  75 vol  %.  The  ranges  for  each  of  the  ranges  are 
summarized in Table 6 , and the justiﬁcation for each of the fuel 
property ranges selected is discussed in Section 5.1.1 to 5.1.6 . 

5.1.1. Realistic range of RON 

The lower limit of RON for the sensitivity analysis was selected 
to be 89, a value that marginally expands the lower limit compared 
to  the  value  of  89.5  from  a  market  survey  of  459  regular-grade 
gasolines [198] . The upper limit of RON was selected at 102, which 
is a value that was investigated in a reﬁnery economics study but 
was found to be marginally beyond what is economically feasible 
for  blending  with  ethanol  at  30 vol  %  [338] .  By  comparison,  the 

J.P. Szybist, S. Busch and R.L. McCormick et al. / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 82 (2021) 100876 

43 

RON value for a 75 vol % ethanol blend fuel can be as high as 107 
[339] . 

5.1.2. Realistic range of S octane 

The  lower  limit  of  S octane  for  the  sensitivity  analysis  is  zero, 
which is the S octane value of iso-octane. Near-zero S octane  can also 
be found in reﬁnery streams that are primarily alkanes, such as 
the alkylate reﬁnery stream. An upper limit of 15 is used for this 
sensitivity analysis. That limit is marginally higher than would be 
expected for a 30 vol % ethanol blend [208] . By comparison, S octane 
for a 75 vol % ethanol blend can be as high as 17 [339] . 

The S octane  is also dependent on K value, and for the purpose 
of this sensitivity analysis, three K values are used in determin- 
ing the merit function score. The signiﬁcance of the K factor to the 
pressure-temperature domain was discussed in Section 3.1.2 . While 
Figs. 16 and 17 illustrated that the pressure-temperature trajectory 
changes with engine operating condition, thereby changing the K 
value within a given engine, this analysis is only concerned with 
the K value at the most knock-limited conditions. This is because 
the knock-limited engine operating conditions effectively limit r c 
and engine eﬃciency. The upper boundary of K for naturally aspi- 
rated engines is K = 0 [185] , where the knock-limited cases follow 
a pressure-temperature trajectory that is close to that of the RON 
test. Next, lightly boosted engines are represented by K = -0.5, and 
highly boosted downsized engines are represented by K = -1.25. 

5.1.3. Realistic range of HoV 

The  lower  limit  of  HoV  can  be  assumed  to  be  a  petroleum- 
derived  gasoline  stream  that  does  not  contain  any  oxygenates, 
which Chupka et al. [207] report to be 350 kJ/kg. The most effec- 
tive way to vary the HoV over wide ranges, however, is by using 
an alcohol, such as ethanol. The upper limit can be assumed to be 
a blended fuel that contains 30 vol % ethanol, which has an HoV 
of approximately 530 kJ/kg [207] . By comparison, the HoV for 75% 
ethanol blends is reported to be 800 kJ/kg [339] . When exercising 
the HoV term in the merit function, the stoichiometric air-fuel ra- 
tio can also change and needs to be accounted for, as explained in 
Section 3.2.1 . 

5.1.4. Realistic range of ﬂame speed 

The  selection  of  upper  and  lower  limits  of  S L  was  done  in 
a  three-step  manner.  First,  the  fuels  that  bound  the  upper  and 
lower  ﬂame  speed  limits  were  identiﬁed  by  Farrell  et  al.  [234] , 
who  measured  the  S L  of  a  wide  variety  of  chemical  structures 
and identiﬁed ethanol as having the fastest ﬂame speed and 1,3,5- 
trimethylbenzene as having the slowest. However, the quantitative 
results from that study cannot be used directly because they were 
collected at elevated pressure and temperature in a spherical com- 
bustion vessel. Thus, the second step was to determine S L of these 
components  at  the  reference  condition  of  1  atm  and  353 K.  For 
ethanol, which is the upper-bound fuel, an S L value of 55 cm/s was 
used [236] , and for 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, an S L value of 39 cm/s 
was used [340] . The ﬁnal step was to assume that the high and 
low  S L  components  are  blended  with  the  baseline  gasoline  at  a 
maximum of 30 vol %. Using the methodology from Sileghem et al. 
[236] ,  S L  of  the  blends  were  estimated  using  an  energy  fraction 
mixing rule, where ﬂame speed is a linear function of the blend 
energy  of  the  components.  From  that  we  can  assume  an  upper 
S L limit of 48.0 cm/s for 30 vol % ethanol and a lower ﬂame S L of 
43.7 cm/s for 30 vol % for 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene. By comparison, 
using the same methodology, the S L for a blend containing 75 vol 
% ethanol is signiﬁcantly higher at 52.0 cm/s. 

5.1.5. Realistic range of PMI 

The selection of a lower limit for the PMI term is not required 
since the merit function term uses a Heaviside function, making 

fuels with a PMI < 1.6 not contribute to the merit function term. 
An upper limit to PMI of 4.0 will be used for the merit function 
sensitivity analysis, which is marginally higher than PMI = 3.86 re- 
ported by Aikawa et al. [280] as the maximum PMI observed in 
a global sample of 1445 gasolines. Since the PMI for ethanol as a 
pure substance is 0.06, E85 will not contribute to an increase in 
PMI relative to the base fuel. However, as described in Section 4.2 , 
using PMI has shortcomings associated with the sooting tendency 
of oxygenated fuels. 

5.1.6. Realistic range of Tc,90 

c,90 of 276 °C. T 

For the catalyst light-off term of the merit function, the refer- 
c,90 for liquid-phase pure hydro- 
ence fuel has a T 
carbons  and  alcohols  ranges  between  219  °C  for  iso-propanol to 
342 °C for mesitylene [289] . However, follow-on work [341] by the 
same authors shows that, at a 30 vol % blend level, the light-off be- 
havior of the petroleum-derived blendstock dominates, and addi- 
tion of up to 30 vol % of other components only varies the light-off
behavior within a ± 15 °C range. For the purposes of this sensi- 
tivity analysis, we will assume that the T 
c,90 can vary by as much 
as 20 °C from the baseline fuel, providing low and high limits of 
256 °C and 296 °C, respectively. No data are available for the T 
c,90 
of a blend of 75 vol % ethanol. 

5.2. Merit function sensitivity analysis 

Fig. 52 shows the sensitivity of the merit function score as a 
function of each individual property over their individual ranges 
and  includes  data  points  for  E85  when  available.  This  exam- 
ines  variations  of  each  individual  term  of  the  merit  function  in 
Eq.  51  without  considering  the  contributions  from  other  merit 
function  terms.  As  described  in  Section  3.4.4  ( Eq.s  32 ),  there  is 
a PMI 
LSPI,crit  threshold above which LSPI becomes too severe and 
the  engine  can  no  longer  be  downsized.  This  is  represented  in 
Fig. 52 through the use of dashed lines in the ﬁrst three terms. Ad- 
ditionally, the form used in the merit function assumes a constant 
linear response for each term. However, there will likely be some 
degree of diminishing returns for large values, thus the uncertainty 
in the merit function response increases for large changes in fuel 
properties relative to the reference fuel. Observations for each fuel 
property follow in Sections 5.2.1 through 5.2.6. 

5.2.1. RON impact on merit function 

RON  has  the  largest  impact  on  the  merit  function  of  all  the 
fuel properties, with the potential to increase the merit function 
score by 7.5 points at RON = 102 from this fuel property alone. The 
dashed line, which represents the RON impact on the merit func- 
tion if LSPI prevents the downsizing eﬃciency multiplier from be- 
ing used, is a minor relative change to the overall RON effect, but is 
substantial relative to some of the other fuel properties considered. 
Using E85, the RON component of the merit function is increased 
by 10 points. 

5.2.2. S octane impact on merit function 

As was discussed in Section 5.1.2 , the impact of S octane was eval- 
uated  at  three  K  values  for  this  sensitivity  analysis  to  represent 
naturally-aspirated  engines,  lightly  boosted  engines,  and  highly 
boosted engines. Naturally-aspirated engines are represented with 
K = 0, and for these conditions, S octane  does not change the merit 
function  score.  Next,  lightly  boosted  engines  are  represented  by 
K = -0.5, and highly boosted downsized engines are represented by 
K = -1.25.  For  conditions  where  K  is  negative,  a  high  S octane  im- 
proves the merit function score. As a result, high S octane  beneﬁts 
highly boosted and downsized engines more than it beneﬁts lightly 
boosted engines because of their lower K values. For cases where 
K is negative, S octane represents the second-biggest impact on the 

44

merit function score behind RON. The S octane for the baseline fuel 
in the merit function score is 8, and S octane values lower than that 
of the baseline fuel have a substantially detrimental impact on the 
merit  function  score  when  K  <  0.  The  dashed  line,  which  rep- 
resents the S octane  impact on the merit function if LSPI prevents 
the downsizing eﬃciency multiplier from being used, is a minor 
change relative to the overall S octane effect, but increases in impor- 
tance with lower K values. The very high S octane value of 17 for E85 
means that this fuel would provide more of a beneﬁt than any of 
the fuels where fuel components would be blended at 30 vol %. 

5.2.3. HoV impact on merit function 

The impact of HoV on the merit function is less signiﬁcant than 
that of either RON or S octane for boosted engines, providing an in- 
crease in the merit function of up to 1.1 for the expected range 
of values. The dashed line, which represents the HoV impact on 
the merit function if LSPI prevents the downsizing eﬃciency mul- 
tiplier from being used, is such a small change that it is diﬃcult 
to  see  the  difference  between  the  lines  on  the  scale  used.  It  is 
also interesting that E85 derives a substantially higher change in 
merit function score from HoV, reaching nearly 5, because of both 
its high HoV and its low stoichiometric air-fuel ratio. 

5.2.4. Flame speed impact on merit function 

The impact of ﬂame speed variation on the merit function score 
over the expected range is small, ±0.4, for fuels up to the expected 
blend level of 30 vol %. Similarly, the merit function score for E85 
is also smaller than for RON, S octane , and HoV, increasing the merit 
function score by 1.1. 

5.2.5. PMI impact on merit function 

The  PMI  term  cannot  provide  a  positive  contribution  to  the 
merit  function.  Rather,  it  provides  a  penalty  for  fuels  with  too 
much sooting propensity because they will require that a partic- 
ulate ﬁlter be used, as discussed in Section 4.2 . As a result, fuels 

with a PMI that is less than the 1.6 threshold do not contribute 
to the merit function score. For fuels with higher PMI, the merit 
function penalty can be signiﬁcant, as much as −2 for a PMI of 4. 

5.2.6. Catalyst light-off temperature impact on merit function 

In comparison to the other terms in the merit function, the cat- 
alyst  light-off term  has  a  small  inﬂuence  ( ± 0.2)  on  the  overall 
merit function score. 

5.3. Exercising the merit function 

In order to exercise the merit function for a variety of poten- 
tial  fuel  candidates,  representing  a  condition  where  the  engine 
has  been  optimized  for  each  fuel  candidate  with  a  conventional 
SI combustion strategy, the properties of the fuel candidates must 
be evaluated. However, many of the fuel properties, such as RON 
and  MON,  do  not  blend  linearly.  The  nonlinear  blending  behav- 
ior  of  RON  and  MON  with  numerous  blendstocks  being  consid- 
ered by the Co-Optima initiative was reported by McCormick et al. 
[342] . Some fuels, such as ethanol and methanol, exhibit a con- 
vex curve in Fig. 53 , which indicates synergistic blending behavior 
in which the octane number of the mixture is higher than would 
be expected.  Other fuels exhibit a straight line, indicating linear 
blending, or a concave curve which indicates antagonistic blend- 
ing where the octane number of the blend is lower than expected 
based on a linear by volume or mole model. The nonlinearity of 
octane response with ethanol is more linear on a molar basis than 
on a volumetric basis [ 339 , 343 ], but there has also been research 
that shows a nonlinearity on a molar blending basis [344] . 

To  account  for  this  nonlinearity,  the  blending  research  oc- 
blending )  and  blending  motor  octane  numbers 
tane  numbers  (RON 
(MON 
blending )  approach  was  adopted,  as  described  by  Gary  and 
Handwerk [345] . Blending octane numbers describe what the oc- 
tane  number  of  the  pure  component  would  need  to  be  if  the 
blend exhibited linear behavior. For the purposes of this analysis,

blend can be readily calculated, all of the components considered 
for  this  analysis  have  PMI  <  1.6,  which  prevents  the  Heaviside 
function for this term from being activated. Additionally, since the 
PMI < 1.6 for all components of interest, we assume that this is be- 
low the PMI 
LSPI,crit threshold value, thus the downsizing eﬃciency 
multiplier is active. 

The  fuel  properties  for  the  selected  bioblendstocks  shown  in 
Table 7 were calculated at blends of 0, 10, 20, 30, and 100 vol% 
using the BOB properties shown in shown in Table 7 . These BOB 
properties  are  based  on  data  from  Chupka  et  al.  [207]  and  can 
be considered typical properties for the BOB that is used to pro- 
duce a regular grade E10 gasoline. The merit function scores are 
shown in Fig. 54 , and note that the data for 100 vol% is presented 
using  a  different  y-axis  scaling.  The  results  show  that  methanol 
and  ethanol  have  the  highest  potential  to  increase  eﬃciency  for 
boosted SI engines of the candidates considered here. Methyl fu- 
ran also scores high at 20 and 30 vol% while diisobutylene scores 
high at 30 vol%. Interestingly, because of the non-linear blending of 
RON and MON, methanol, ethanol, and methyl furan provide nearly 
the same merit function score at 20 vol% as they do at 30 vol%. In 
contrast, both iso-butanol and diisobutylene exhibit a much more 
linear blending behavior, with a substantial merit function increase 
between  20  and  30  vol%.  Finally,  despite  ethyl  acetate  having  a 
very high RON (118), its low S octane ( −2.3) and antagonistic blend- 
ing behavior make it a very low value blendstock. 

The merit function scores for this subset of fuel candidates is 
not a comprehensive assessment of the eﬃciency potential for all 
fuels.  Rather,  it  is  a  demonstration  of  the  technique  to  estimate 
the eﬃciency improvement potential of a fuel if the engine is opti- 
mized for the fuel. Further, the merit function produces reasonable 
results when compared with values published in the literature. For 

blending and MON 

blending  and  MON 

blending for each fuel component were calcu- 
RON 
lated from the nonlinear blending relationships reported by Mc- 
Cormick  et  al.  [342] .  The  RON 
blending  change  as 
the blending concentration changes. Thus, these values were cal- 
culated for concentrations of 10, 20, and 30 vol % for a relatively 
small set of fuel components intended to represent a range of fuel 
chemistries (alcohols, furans, oleﬁns, and acetates); these data are 
shown  in  Table  7 .  A  more  comprehensive  list  of  the  fuel  merit 
function scores and blending properties for the fuel blends con- 
sidered within the Co-Optima initiative, including the lifecycle en- 
vironmental beneﬁts for these speciﬁc fuel blends, is provided by 
Gaspar et al. [346] . 

The other properties needed to calculate the merit function are 
HoV, S L , PMI, and T c,90 . Both S L and T c,90 have very small impacts 
on  the  expected  merit  function  score,  as  shown  in  Fig.  52 ,  and 
therefore will be neglected for this analysis. HoV blends nearly lin- 
early on a mass basis [207] , and therefore is readily accounted for 
if the HoV as the pure component or blending stream values were 
taken from McCormick et al. [342] . Similarly, while PMI blends lin-

Fig. 54.  Calculated merit function score for select components at 0, 10, 20, 30, and 100 vol %. Note that the 0 vol % concentrations represents a sub-octane BOB and thus has 
a negative merit function score relative to the baseline gasoline. 

instance, for a blend of 30 vol % ethanol, the merit function score 
is 10, or a 10% relative improvement compared to a baseline regu- 
lar grade gasoline. In a paper from Leone et al. [209] , a fuel blend 
containing 30 vol % ethanol combined with a compression ratio in- 
crease from 10:1 to 13:1 produced a relative eﬃciency increase of 
8.6% over the baseline regular grade gasoline. Similarly, Splitter and 
Szybist [347] reported a relative eﬃciency gain of 7% compared to 
the base gasoline at a lower compression ratio, but also showed 
that a higher load was achievable with the E30, meaning that the 
compression ratio and eﬃciency could likely have been increased 
further,  or  the  engine  could  have  been  downsized,  to  achieve  a 
matched engine power density. 

The merit function was developed as a tool to determine the 
eﬃciency potential of a fuel blend in an SI engine based on its fuel 
properties, representing a condition where the engine has been op- 
timized for each fuel candidate with a conventional SI combustion 
strategy. However, there are other potential criteria for the merit of 
a particular fuel or blending component, such as criteria emissions 
compliance, lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions, or production cost. 
Thus, fuel properties that are not included in the merit function, 
or that produce a negligible eﬃciency difference in the merit func- 
tion, can still be signiﬁcant in other contexts. 

6. Future prospects 

The  analysis  presented  in  this  paper  provides  a  systematic 
methodology to assess the eﬃciency potential of a particular fuel 
blend on the basis of its fuel properties in a chemistry-agnostic 
manner,  according  to  the  CFPH.  While  much  of  the  information 
that contributed to the development of this methodology was pre- 
viously known, this all-encompassing approach is new. As a result, 
in most instances, the merit function was based on fuel-property 
studies that were not speciﬁcally designed to quantify the impact 
of  an  isolated  fuel  property  on  eﬃciency.  Thus,  research  can  be 
recommended for each term in the merit function with the objec- 
tive of reducing uncertainty and/or including fuel effects that are 
not yet accounted for in the current merit function form. This is 
described for each of the fuel properties below. 

6.1. Improvements to antiknock properties 

In this analysis, measures of fuel antiknock properties were ac- 
counted for using OI, which is superior to RON, MON, or AKI, as 
described in Section 3.1 . However, OI is an extrapolation of RON 
and MON tests that do not represent modern engines. These tests 

do not use stoichiometric AFR, operate at engine speeds that are 
slower than modern engines, have long combustion duration due 
to the low turbulence levels, use advanced spark timing and com- 
bustion  phasing,  and  test  for  knock  at  light  loads  with  ambient 
pressure intake manifolds. Further, the knock sensing technology 
in these engines is different from the accelerometer that is used in 
modern engines. 

Thus,  potential  future  work  for  improving  the  merit  function 
would center on developing an improved antiknock fuel property 
metric  that  is  more  representative  of  knock  in  modern  engines, 
both for boosted HPD and naturally aspirated LPD engines. Such 
a development program should consider the fundamental kinetic 
basis for the knock event, such that the K factor isn’t a required in- 
put since the uncertainty of OI increases as the K factor decreases 
below zero [171] . 

6.2. Improvements to heat of vaporization impact 

Despite  signiﬁcant  progress  in  decoupling  the  effects  of  HoV 
from S octane , as described in Section 3.2 , the isolated effect of HoV 
still  is  not  clear.  This  is  partially  due  to  the  different  ways  that 
HoV can impact the RON and MON tests, which, as described by 
Kolodziej et al. [211] and shown in Fig. 29 , can lead to a factor of 
4 difference in the impact of HoV on the knock propensity. Thus, 
in order to better quantify the effect of HoV on knock propensity 
in an unambiguous manner, we recommend that HoV be consid- 
ered in the development of the new antiknock metric proposed in 
Section 6.1 in a way that the HoV effect can be isolated. 

6.3. Improvements to ﬂame speed impact 

Despite  it  being  well-known  to  fuels  and  engine  combustion 
engineers that high ﬂame speed is important for engines, this lit- 
erature review, which focused on stoichiometric combustion, did 
not  ﬁnd  clear  evidence  that  ﬂame  speed  could  provide  an  eﬃ- 
ciency beneﬁt in stoichiometric SI engines beyond the ability to ex- 
tend the dilution limit. Instead, it was found that slow ﬂame speed 
could degrade eﬃciency in the absence of modiﬁcations to engine 
operation, and it was not clear that the  degradation would per- 
sist in an optimized engine when, for example, combustion timing 
could  be  optimized with  advanced  spark  timing.  Thus,  it  is  rec- 
ommended that the effect of ﬂame speed on engine eﬃciency be 
studied to determine what ﬂame speed impacts exist under non- 
dilute operating conditions.

6.4. Improved quantiﬁcation of LSPI fuel impacts 

Our understanding of fuel impacts on LSPI is still very much 
under development. In order to attempt to quantify the effects of 
LSPI on engine eﬃciency, PMI was used as a fuel property basis be- 
cause is increases with high distillation temperatures and with aro- 
matics. However, linking PMI with LSPI is a relatively new concept. 
Thus, it is recommended that this proposed fuel property basis for 
LSPI be validated across several different engine platforms and for 
a  wide  range  of  fuels.  Further,  it  is  recommended  that  the  eﬃ- 
ciency penalty associated with LSPI be further developed. In this 
review, it was hypothesized that LSPI prevented further downsiz- 
ing of the engine, thereby precluding the use of the downsizing ef- 
ﬁciency multiplier, but this hypothesis has not yet been validated. 
Lastly, because LSPI is a multi-step sequence where each step is 
required but not suﬃcient on its own, as described by Chapman 
et  al.  [247]  and  shown  in  Fig.  36 ,  it  is  recommended  that  non- 
initiation LSPI fuel effects be further developed. A number of these 
were described in Section 3.4.3 , but they are at an early stage of 
development and cannot yet be quaniﬁed in the merit function. 

6.5. Improved particulate matter impacts 

Although presently PMI (a fuel property) appears to be the best 
available model for predicting PM emissions from gasoline compo- 
sition, the literature has demonstrated PMI’s shortcomings regard- 
ing effects on PM from blending oxygenates into gasoline. There- 
fore, continued development of better models is warranted. How- 
ever, because ethanol is the dominant oxygenate currently in the 
gasoline market, and C3-C4 alcohols appear to have similar poten- 
tial, near term PM model improvements might be constrained to 
account for alcohol-aromatic interaction effects. 

In addition to being able to predict PM in a more accurate man- 
ner, developing a better understanding of how PM can affect ef- 
ﬁciency is necessary. Speciﬁcally, the impact of PMI was quanti- 
ﬁed with a Heaviside function that assumed that a GPF would be 
necessary  above  a  certain  threshold  value.  There  is  a  signiﬁcant 
amount of uncertainty about the development of engine technolo- 
gies and emissions standards, such that identifying such a thresh- 
old value is challenging. Thus, it is recommended that studies be 
conducted to quantify the threshold value of PMI (or an improved 
PMI replacement) such that the threshold value can be identiﬁed. 
Further investigations into the eﬃciency impacts of GPFs are also 
warranted. 

6.6. Improved understanding of catalyst light-off

Section 5.2 illustrated that the catalyst light-off temperature is 
expected to only have a minor impact on engine eﬃciency. How- 
ever, it remains true that all engines must meet applicable emis- 
sions standards to be sold. Further, allowable emissions of criteria 
pollutants continue to decrease such that meeting these emissions 
standards at the full useful life of the engine is becoming more 
challenging. Thus, it is recommended that a different merit func- 
tion be developed that quantiﬁes how fuel properties and chem- 
istry impact the ability to achieve criteria emissions. 

7. Summary/conclusions 

ing a thermodynamic expression of brake engine eﬃciency as the 
product of several component eﬃciencies that include: 

• mechanical eﬃciency 
• combustion eﬃciency 
• gas exchange eﬃciency 
• proportion of total heat release available after wall heat losses 
• ideal cycle eﬃciency 
• degree to which the actual heat release proﬁle resembles the 

ideal proﬁle. 

Using this framework, the incremental eﬃciency potentials of 
individual fuel properties were quantiﬁed by their ability to incre- 
mentally change one or more of the component eﬃciency terms 
identiﬁed in the thermodynamic analysis through in-cylinder pro- 
cesses. Speciﬁcally, the fuel properties quantiﬁed were: the ability 
to resist knock, as described by OI which includes both RON and 
S octane ; the combined effects of HoV; and the effect of S L  on the 
EGR dilution tolerance. Note that the eﬃciency improvements were 
considered for an optimized engine where, for instance, if a fuel 
property enhanced the knock resistance of the fuel, the quantiﬁed 
eﬃciency improvement considers a corresponding r c increase. Sig- 
niﬁcant fuel effects on LSPI were also reviewed, and a framework 
on how fuel properties affecting LSPI can limit engine eﬃciency by 
preventing downsizing was proposed. The fuel property threshold 
at which this downsizing limit is met has yet to be quantiﬁed. 

Additionally, this study considered the effect of fuel properties 
on  the  use  of  exhaust  aftertreatment,  which  is  needed  to  meet 
emission standards. For gaseous emissions, this was done through 
quantifying the difference in fuel consumption, relative to a base- 
line fuel, to achieve three-way catalyst light-off, where the tem- 
perature at which light-off occurred was fuel-speciﬁc. For particle 
emissions, it was done by assuming there was a threshold sooting 
tendency, quantiﬁed by PMI, over which a GPF would be required 
to achieve emissions compliance. Under this PMI threshold, no ef- 
ﬁciency penalty would be incurred, but above the threshold the 
penalty would continuously increase. 

Each of these individual terms was normalized on the basis of 
a relative eﬃciency improvement and combined into a merit func- 
tion. Performing a sensitivity analysis of the merit function over 
the expected ranges of fuel properties, it is apparent that RON and 
S octane have the most potential to improve eﬃciency, and that HoV 
can also provide a signiﬁcant beneﬁt. However, S L , PMI, and the 
catalyst light-off temperature were found to have small effects on 
eﬃciency. 

As  constructed,  the  merit  function  provides  a  tool  for  com- 
paring  the  advantages  and  disadvantages  of  different  fuel  prop- 
erties  as  they  relate  to  eﬃciency  for  different  fuel  blends.  The 
merit function is applicable, to the ﬁrst order, to both conventional 
petroleum-derived fuels, bio-based fuels, or blends of the two. Fur- 
ther, the merit function applies to all types of stoichiometric SI en- 
gine architectures that use a ﬁxed r c , including both boosted and 
naturally aspirated engines. As a result, this is a tool that can be 
used to guide producers of alternative fuels towards formulations 
that can enable the highest eﬃciency engine operation.
