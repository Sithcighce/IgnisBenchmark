    "question_text": "How does the mesoscale lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) approach described in the paper simulate H₂O diffusion in porous CaO structures for thermochemical energy storage applications, and what specific insights about gas transport mechanisms are explicitly supported by the provided citations?",
    "standard_answer": "The paper describes that Xia et al. simulated H₂O diffusion within CaO by first reconstructing the mesoscale porous structure of CaO using a random-walk model to generate realistic pore networks. The lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) was then employed to describe gas diffusion through these complex pore structures by solving the lattice Boltzmann equations, which track fluid particle distributions and their evolution over discrete lattice sites and time steps. This mesoscale approach captures gas transport through the tortuous pore networks without requiring explicit resolution of individual pore geometries. The simulation provides insights into how H₂O molecules navigate through the porous media, revealing diffusion patterns and concentration gradients. Additionally, the paper notes that appropriate temperature selection is crucial to both improve the energy storage performance and reduce crushing risk, and the calcium-based particle showed a high energy storage efficiency and cycle stability when the radius fell into 300–500 μm. These findings help understand gas transport limitations and optimize operational parameters for thermochemical energy storage systems.",
