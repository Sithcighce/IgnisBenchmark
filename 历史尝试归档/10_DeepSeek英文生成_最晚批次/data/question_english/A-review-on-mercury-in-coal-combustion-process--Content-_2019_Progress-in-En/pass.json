    "question_text": "How do different chlorine species (HCl, Cl₂, Cl radicals) affect homogeneous mercury oxidation in coal combustion flue gas, and what is their relative effectiveness?",
    "standard_answer": "Chlorine species exhibit distinct roles in homogeneous mercury oxidation due to their varying reactivity and oxidation mechanisms. Cl radicals are the most effective oxidizers, initiating Hg⁰ oxidation through radical reactions. Cl₂ acts as a secondary oxidant that can further oxidize mercury intermediates, though it is less efficient than radicals due to slower kinetics. HCl is the least effective chlorine species for mercury oxidation, requiring higher temperatures for significant reaction. The relative effectiveness follows the order: Cl radical > Cl₂ > HCl. Temperature plays a crucial role in determining which chlorine species dominates mercury oxidation - Cl₂ is more effective at lower temperatures while HCl becomes more favorable at higher temperatures. The oxidation process is kinetically controlled rather than thermodynamically controlled, which explains why measured Hg²⁺ fractions in actual systems (30-95%) differ from equilibrium predictions that would suggest complete oxidation to HgCl₂ below 452°C.",

      "1": "It has been shown that the Hg⁰ reaction with HCl was favorable at higher temperatures while it reacted favorably with Cl₂ at lower temperatures.",
      "2": "The degree of effect of Cl forms on Hg⁰ oxidation is the Cl radical, Cl₂, and HCl in decreasing order."

    "question_text": "Based on the provided paper content, what are the observed effects of SO₂ and NO on homogeneous mercury oxidation by chlorine in coal combustion flue gas, and what specific experimental evidence supports these effects?",
    "standard_answer": "According to the paper content, SO₂ inhibits Hg⁰ oxidation with the presence of HCl in the gas mixture. The paper specifically states that 'an SO₂ concentration of 500 ppmv decreases the percentage of Hg²⁺ from 27% to 20% at an HCl concentration of 200 ppmv.' This demonstrates a clear inhibitory effect where SO₂ reduces mercury oxidation efficiency. For NO, the paper indicates that 'NO significantly decreased mercury oxidation with the addition of chlorine (Cl = 500 ppmv).' These experimental observations show that both SO₂ and NO act as inhibitors to mercury oxidation by chlorine species in homogeneous reactions. The effects are concentration-dependent, as shown by the specific ppmv values provided. The paper does not provide detailed chemical mechanisms for these inhibitory effects, but presents the experimental evidence of reduced Hg²⁺ formation when these gases are present alongside chlorine compounds in the flue gas environment.",
