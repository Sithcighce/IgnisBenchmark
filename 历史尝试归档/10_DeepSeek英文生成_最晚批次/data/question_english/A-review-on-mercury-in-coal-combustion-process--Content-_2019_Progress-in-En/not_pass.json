    "question_text": "Based on the review paper, explain the specific catalytic mechanisms of metal oxides and unburned carbon in fly ash during heterogeneous mercury oxidation, and describe the detailed interactions between these fly ash constituents and key flue gas components (HCl, SO₂, H₂O) that influence mercury transformation in coal-fired power plants. Include the molecular-level reaction pathways and how these interactions affect mercury oxidation efficiency.",
    "standard_answer": "The review paper indicates that metal oxides in fly ash serve as active catalysts for heterogeneous mercury oxidation through surface-mediated redox reactions. Metal oxides like Fe₂O₃, CuO, and MnO₂ provide active sites where Hg⁰ adsorption occurs, followed by electron transfer processes that oxidize elemental mercury to Hg²⁺. The catalytic activity depends on the specific metal oxide's redox potential and surface area. Unburned carbon in fly ash enhances mercury oxidation through both physical adsorption and chemical reactions. The carbon matrix provides abundant surface area and active functional groups that facilitate Hg⁰ adsorption and subsequent oxidation. The paper specifically states that 'Unburned carbon in fly ash... plays an important role in Hg⁰ oxidation' by creating reactive sites where mercury can be transformed. Regarding flue gas interactions, HCl promotes mercury oxidation by providing chlorine species that react with adsorbed mercury on fly ash surfaces, forming mercury chloride compounds. In oxy-coal combustion specifically, 'HCl has a higher oxidation effect on Hg⁰ than that in air-coal combustion atmosphere' due to different gas composition effects. SO₂ interacts with fly ash components by potentially competing for active sites on metal oxides and carbon surfaces, though the paper does not provide specific mechanistic details about SO₂ inhibition in heterogeneous oxidation. H₂O vapor enhances the oxidation process as 'H₂O promotes the oxidation' in the context of fly ash's role in Hg⁰ oxidation, likely by facilitating surface reactions and maintaining catalyst activity. The complex interplay between these components determines the overall mercury transformation efficiency, with optimal conditions depending on the specific fly ash composition and flue gas environment.",

Include the mechanisms supported by the paper's findings and explain the apparent contradiction between CO₂'s dual role in mercury oxidation without adding unsupported mechanistic explanations.",
    "standard_answer": "Oxy-coal combustion significantly alters mercury transformation pathways compared to conventional air-fired combustion due to fundamental changes in flue gas composition. In oxy-firing, nitrogen (N₂) is replaced with recycled CO₂, creating a combustion atmosphere with high CO₂ concentrations (typically 70-90%) and elevated O₂ levels (often 25-30%). According to the paper, 'For the mercury transformation in oxy-coal combustion, O₂ promotes Hg⁰ oxidation with Cl₂ while NO and CO₂ inhibit or do not favor that reaction.' This indicates that O₂ enhances mercury oxidation through chlorine pathways, while CO₂ acts as an inhibitor in this specific reaction context. However, the paper also explicitly states that 'CO₂ increases Hg⁰ oxidation' in oxy-coal combustion, which appears contradictory but must be accepted as reported without unsupported mechanistic explanations. The paper further states that 'HCl has a higher oxidation effect on Hg⁰ than that in air-coal combustion atmosphere,' suggesting that HCl becomes more effective for mercury oxidation under oxy-firing conditions. In homogeneous oxidation pathways, the elevated O₂ levels promote oxidation through enhanced chlorine chemistry, particularly with Cl₂ formation. The enhanced effectiveness of HCl under oxy-firing conditions contributes significantly to improved mercury oxidation. For heterogeneous pathways, the paper states that 'Fly ash plays an important role in Hg⁰ oxidation,' though it does not make comparative significance claims between oxy and air conditions. The apparent contradiction regarding CO₂'s role must be acknowledged as reported: CO₂ inhibits Hg⁰ oxidation with Cl₂ specifically, while simultaneously increasing overall Hg⁰ oxidation through other pathways not explicitly detailed in the paper.",

Given: SCR Hg⁰ oxidation rate = 6.5–79.9%, ESP Hgₜ removal rate = 28.5–90%, WFGD Hgₜ removal rate = 3.9–72%. Assume initial mercury distribution: 85% Hg⁰, 5% Hg²⁺, 10% Hgₚ.

    "standard_answer": "Initial mercury speciation: Hg⁰ = 85%, Hg²⁺ = 5%, Hgₚ = 10% (total Hgₜ = 100%). After SCR: SCR oxidizes elemental mercury to oxidized mercury. With 43.2% Hg⁰ oxidation, the amount oxidized = 0.432 × 85% = 36.72% of initial Hgₜ. New speciation: Hg⁰ = 85% - 36.72% = 48.28%, Hg²⁺ = 5% + 36.72% = 41.72%, Hgₚ = 10%. After ESP: ESP removes total mercury at 59.25% rate, but is particularly effective for Hgₚ removal. Total mercury to ESP = 100%. ESP removal = 59.25% of initial Hgₜ. Remaining Hgₜ = 100% - 59.25% = 40.75%.

After WFGD: WFGD captures total mercury at 37.95% rate. WFGD removal = 0.3795 × (19.67% + 17.00% + 4.08%) = 0.3795 × 40.75% = 15.46% of initial Hgₜ. Remaining Hgₜ = 40.75% - 15.46% = 25.29%.
