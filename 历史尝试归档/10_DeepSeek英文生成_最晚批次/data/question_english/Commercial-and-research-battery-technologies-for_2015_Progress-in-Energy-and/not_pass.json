    "question_text": "Based on the provided paper excerpt, explain how polarization losses affect the operating voltage and available energy in electrochemical cells used for electrical energy storage systems. Describe the three types of polarization losses and their relationship to the cell's voltage characteristics, including how these losses lead to voltage drop as a function of operating current. Also explain why the available energy can be maximized when the cell operates close to the open-circuit voltage.",
    "standard_answer": "According to the paper, electrochemical cells experience three main types of polarization losses that significantly impact their operating voltage and available energy. The polarizations are classified as: activation polarization that is related to the kinetics of electrochemical reaction at the interface between electrode and electrolyte, concentration polarization that is caused by mass transport limitation, and ohmic polarization that is related to contact resistance within cell. These different polarization losses lead to a voltage drop as a function of operating current, as shown in Figure 3b of the paper. The operating voltage, Eop, is given by Eop = Eoc - η, where Eoc is the open-circuit voltage and η is the overvoltage representing the deviation from the equilibrium open-circuit voltage caused mainly by polarization. Therefore, the available energy can be maximized when the cell is close to the open-circuit voltage, because its value is associated with the cell capacity and average operating voltage. The cumulative effect of these polarization losses reduces the operating voltage below the theoretical open-circuit voltage, directly decreasing the energy that can be extracted from the electrochemical cell during discharge operations in electrical energy storage applications. Each polarization type contributes to the overall voltage loss in different ways, with activation polarization affecting reaction kinetics, concentration polarization limiting mass transport, and ohmic polarization creating resistance-based voltage drops throughout the cell structure.",
