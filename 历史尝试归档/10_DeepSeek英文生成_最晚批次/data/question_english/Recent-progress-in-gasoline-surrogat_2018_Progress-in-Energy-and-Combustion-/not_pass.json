    "question_text": "Based on the provided paper content, explain how fuel volatility characteristics (specifically distillation profile and vapor pressure) influence mixture formation in port fuel injection (PFI) versus gasoline direct injection (GDI) engines, focusing on the physical mechanisms involved. Support your explanation with specific evidence from the paper regarding cold-start performance, spray behavior, and emissions relationships.",
    "standard_answer": "Fuel volatility characteristics significantly impact mixture formation through different physical mechanisms in PFI and GDI engines due to their distinct injection strategies and evaporation timescales. In PFI engines, fuel is injected into the intake port where it has longer residence time for evaporation. The paper states that 'the front end of the distillation curve determines the initial volatility of the mixture, which impacts cold start performance and evaporative losses.' Under cold-start conditions, only 20-30% of fuel is vaporized in the inlet port, making wall wetting significant. The paper notes that 'fuel volatility has a significant impact on HC emissions' in PFI engines, where fuels with high T50 result in leaner air/fuel ratios due to poor vaporization, causing lean misfiring and increasing HC emissions. In GDI engines, the paper emphasizes that 'the distribution of the fuel spray has a significant impact on the in-cylinder combustion process due to the short time available for fuel/air mixing.' Higher volatility components in multi-component fuel mixtures evaporate quickly when fuel temperature is high, resulting in disruption of the spray structure and formation of a vapor core within the spray core. Fuel volatility also impacted spray penetration length and spray width, with higher volatility decreasing liquid and vapor penetration distances. The physical mechanisms involve competing effects of droplet evaporation rates governed by vapor pressure and boiling points, spray breakup dynamics, and turbulent mixing with air, all determining local equivalence ratio distribution before combustion.",
