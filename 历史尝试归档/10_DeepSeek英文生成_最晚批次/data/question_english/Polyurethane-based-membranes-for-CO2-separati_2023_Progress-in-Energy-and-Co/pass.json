    "question_text": "Calculate the CO₂ permeability in barrer for a dense polyurethane membrane with a thickness of 50 μm, if the steady-state CO₂ flux is 2.5 × 10⁻⁶ cm³(STP)/(cm²·s) under a pressure difference of 2 atm. Assume standard conditions and interpret how hard segment content might alter this value based on free volume considerations.",
    "standard_answer": "Using the permeability equation P = (flux × L) / ΔP, where flux = 2.5 × 10⁻⁶ cm³(STP)/(cm²·s), L = 50 μm = 5 × 10⁻³ cm, and ΔP = 2 atm. Note that 1 barrer = 10⁻¹⁰ cm³(STP)·cm/(cm²·s·cm Hg), and 1 atm = 76 cm Hg, so ΔP = 2 × 76 = 152 cm Hg. Thus, P = (2.5 × 10⁻⁶ × 5 × 10⁻³) / 152 = (1.25 × 10⁻⁸) / 152 ≈ 8.22 × 10⁻¹¹ cm³(STP)·cm/(cm²·s·cm Hg). Converting to barrer: P = 8.22 × 10⁻¹¹ / 10⁻¹⁰ = 0.822 barrer. This low permeability suggests high hard segment content, as hard segments reduce free volume and chain mobility. Increasing hard segment percentage decreases fractional free volume, as hard segments form compact, impermeable domains that restrict soft segment dynamics. For example, a PU with 43 wt% hard segments showed CO₂ permeability of 38.2 barrer, while at 26 wt%, it increased to 79.5 barrer. Thus, higher hard segment content typically lowers permeability by reducing diffusion pathways, though it may increase selectivity due to enhanced size-sieving in rigid domains.",

    "question_text": "Why do polyurethane membranes with polyether soft segments like PEG exhibit higher CO₂ solubility selectivity over N₂ compared to polyester-based soft segments, and how does crystallization in PEG affect this behavior?",
    "standard_answer": "Polyether-based soft segments (e.g., PEG, PTMG) enhance CO₂ solubility selectivity due to the presence of ether oxygen atoms, which engage in strong dipole-quadrupole interactions with CO₂'s quadrupole moment. CO₂ has a significant quadrupole moment (-4.3 × 10⁻²⁶ esu cm²), while N₂ has a weaker one, leading to preferential solubility of CO₂ in ether-rich domains. In contrast, polyester soft segments (e.g., PCL) have ester groups that are less polar and may form weaker interactions with CO₂, reducing solubility selectivity. However, PEG tends to crystallize, forming impermeable crystalline domains that reduce overall permeability by blocking diffusion pathways. This crystallization diminishes the effective area for gas transport, as crystalline regions do not participate in the solution-diffusion process. To mitigate this, copolymers like PEG-b-PPG are used, where PPG units disrupt PEG crystallization, maintaining amorphousness and preserving chain mobility. For instance, PU membranes with PEG-b-PPG triblock copolymers show higher CO₂ permeability and selectivity than pure PEG-based ones, as the amorphous structure allows sustained dipole-quadrupole interactions without crystalline barriers. Thus, while ether groups boost CO₂ solubility, crystallization in PEG must be suppressed to maximize permeability and selectivity.",

    "question_text": "Using the solution-diffusion model, derive the relationship between gas permeability (P), solubility (S), and diffusivity (D) for dense polymeric membranes, and explain how this model predicts CO₂/N₂ selectivity in rubbery versus glassy polyurethanes.",
    "standard_answer": "The solution-diffusion model describes gas transport through dense membranes as a three-step process: adsorption/dissolution at the upstream surface, diffusion driven by concentration gradient, and desorption at the downstream. Permeability (P) is derived from Fick's first law (Flux = -D dC/dL) and Henry's law (C = S p), where C is concentration, p is pressure, and L is membrane thickness. Combining these, steady-state permeability is P = (flux × L)/ΔP. Substituting Flux = -D dC/dL and integrating across the membrane with boundary conditions C₁ = S p₁ and C₂ = S p₂ gives P = S × D. For ideal selectivity of gas A over B, α_A/B = P_A/P_B = (S_A/S_B) × (D_A/D_B). In rubbery polyurethanes (above T_g), chains are flexible, and gas transport is dominated by solubility selectivity because diffusion coefficients are similar for small molecules; CO₂/N₂ selectivity arises primarily from CO₂'s higher condensability and strong dipole-quadrupole interactions with polar groups (e.g., ether oxygen), leading to S_CO₂/S_N₂ >> 1. In glassy polyurethanes (below T_g), chains are rigid, and selectivity is governed by diffusivity selectivity; smaller molecules diffuse faster, but since CO₂ and N₂ have similar kinetic diameters, D_CO₂/D_N₂ is modest, resulting in lower overall selectivity. Thus, rubbery PU membranes favor CO₂/N₂ separation via solubility, while glassy ones rely less effectively on diffusivity.",
    "original_text": {
      "1": "Based on the solution-diffusion model, the permeability depends on solubility (S) and diffusivity (D) coefficients and can be determined using the following equation: P = S × D",

    "question_text": "How does the degree of phase separation (DPS) between hard and soft segments in polyurethane membranes affect CO₂ permeability and selectivity, and what molecular mechanisms drive this relationship?",
    "standard_answer": "The degree of phase separation (DPS) critically influences CO₂ transport in polyurethane membranes through competing mechanisms. Higher DPS enhances CO₂ permeability by increasing chain mobility in soft segments and free volume, as hard segments aggregate into rigid, impermeable domains. This occurs because hard segments (urethane/urea groups) form strong hydrogen bonds among themselves, reducing intermixing with soft segments (polyether/polyester chains). Consequently, soft segments remain flexible with higher fractional free volume, facilitating gas diffusion. However, increased DPS often reduces CO₂ selectivity due to diminished solubility selectivity; when hard and soft segments are highly separated, there are fewer polar groups (e.g., –NH, ether oxygen) dispersed in the soft domains to interact with CO₂ via dipole-quadrupole interactions. The DPS is quantified via FTIR using the carbonyl hydrogen bonding index (R = A₁₇₀₂/A₁₇₃₀), where higher R values indicate more hydrogen bonding within hard segments, promoting phase separation. For instance, membranes with aliphatic diisocyanates like HDI exhibit higher DPS and permeability but lower selectivity compared to aromatic ones like TDI, due to better hard segment ordering and reduced phase mixing. Thus, optimizing DPS balances permeability (favored by separation) and selectivity (favored by some mixing).",

    "standard_answer": "The incorporation of bulky chain extenders in polyurethane-urea membranes enhances CO₂ permeability and plasticization resistance through specific structural modifications. Bulky chain extenders increase the fractional free volume and degree of phase separation while lowering the glass transition temperature, which collectively improves gas transport properties. The larger inter-chain spacing created by bulky groups in hard domains allows typically impermeable hard segments to contribute to gas transport pathways. This structural disruption prevents close packing and maintains membrane integrity under high CO₂ pressures, thereby resisting plasticization. The relationship between these parameters is demonstrated by experimental observations where membranes with bulkier chain extenders exhibit superior gas permeation correlated with higher fractional free volume, increased phase separation, and reduced glass transition temperatures. This combination of structural characteristics optimizes the permeability-selectivity trade-off while enhancing pressure stability in CO₂ separation applications.",
