    "question_text": "In smouldering combustion of biomass materials, how does the temperature-dependent production of CO and CO₂ differ between nitrogen and air atmospheres, and what mechanisms explain the observed CO/CO₂ ratios at different temperature stages based on thermal degradation processes?",
    "standard_answer": "The temperature-dependent production of CO and CO₂ in smouldering combustion of biomass materials shows distinct differences between nitrogen and air atmospheres, with specific mechanisms explaining the observed CO/CO₂ ratios. In nitrogen atmospheres, CO₂ production occurs across the entire temperature range above 100°C, while CO production only begins above 225°C, indicating oxygen-independent decomposition pathways from biomass components. At approximately 325°C, the CO/CO₂ ratio remains around 0.25 in both air and nitrogen environments, demonstrating this reaction is oxygen-limited but chemically consistent across atmospheres. The most significant difference occurs at higher temperatures around 425°C, where the CO/CO₂ ratio drops to approximately 0.05 in air. This reduction occurs because after all lignocellulosic biomass components have thermally degraded to char, the increased surface-to-volume ratio allows surrounding oxygen to attack the highly exposed char surface, promoting more complete combustion that favors CO₂ formation over CO. The spatial distribution of these reactions creates distinct temperature zones where different thermal degradation mechanisms dominate, with lower temperature decomposition occurring ahead of the main oxidation front while char oxidation dominates at the highest temperature regions.",

      "1": "The production of CO and CO₂ in nitrogen covers the entire temperature range above 100°C while the production of CO only begins above 225°C.",
      "2": "For the final peak (~425°C), the CO/CO₂ ratio is 0.05. After all the lignocellulosic biomass has been thermally degraded to char, thereby increasing the biomass' surface to volume ratio, the surrounding O₂ attacks the highly exposed surface of the remaining char and promotes complete combustion, resulting in a lower CO/CO₂ ratio."
