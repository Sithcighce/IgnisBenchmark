Fuel consumption gap
Passenger cars

Official laboratory-measured monitoring data indicate a progressive decline in the average fuel consump-
tion and CO2 emissions of the European passenger car fleet. There is increasing evidence to suggest that offi-
cially reported CO2 values do not reflect the actual performance of the vehicles on the road. A reported
difference of 30(cid:1)40% between official values and real-world estimates was found which has been continu-
ously increasing. This paper reviews the influence of different factors that affect fuel consumption and CO2
emissions on the road and in the laboratory. Factors such as driving behaviour, vehicle configuration and
traffic conditions are reconfirmed as highly influential. Neglected factors (e.g. side winds, rain, road grade),
which may have significant contributions in fuel consumption in real world driving are identified. The mar-
gins of the present certification procedure contribute between 10 and 20% in the gap between the reported
values and reality. The latter was estimated to be of the order of 40%, or 47.5 gCO2/km for 2015 average fleet
emissions, but could range up to 60% or down to 19% depending on prevailing traffic conditions. The intro-
duction of a new test protocol is expected to bridge about half of the present divergence between laboratory
and real world. Finally, substantial literature was found on the topic; however, the lack of common test pro-
cedures, analysis tools, and coordinated activity across different countries point out the need for additional
research in order to support targeted actions for real world CO2 reduction. Quality checks of the CO2 certifi-
cation procedure, and the reported values, combined with in-use consumption monitoring could be used to
assess the gap on a continuous basis.

1. Introduction

PRoad transport contributes about one-fifth of the European
Union's (EU) total emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), the main
Greenhouse Gas (GHG), 75% of which originates from passenger cars
[1(cid:1)3]. Despite the fact that these emissions fell by 3.3% in 2012, they
are still 20.5% higher than in 1990. Transport is the only major sector
in the EU where GHG emissions are still rising [4]. The automotive
sector accounts for 4% of the European GDP and 12 million jobs, or
5.6% of the employed population in Europe [5,6]. In terms of policy,
the European Commission's (EC) 2011 White Paper for Transport [7]
highlighted the importance of reducting GHG emissions in order to
make the transition to a low carbon economy. In its 2016 communi-
cation to the European Parliament the EC stressed the potential of
the transport sector to further contribute to reducing the EU's emis-
sions and contribute to the EU's commitment under the Paris Cli-
mate Change Agreement [8]. Since 2009 the EU has set mandatory
targets for the average CO2 emissions of each vehicle manufacturer

P(OEM) at 130 CO2/km (2015) and 95 CO2/km (2021) [9]. In recent
years, the issue of fuel consumption and CO2 emissions has received
significant attention by the public, environmental and consumer
organizations [10]; certain consumer organizations have taken legal
action against vehicle companies claiming they have exaggerated
the fuel-saving credentials of their vehicles.

PCO2 emissions of passenger cars are measured as part of the vehi-
cle certification [11] test which is based on the New European Driv-
ing Cycle (NEDC), and is also referred to as the NEDC test. The fuel
consumption of the vehicles is indirectly derived from the measure-
ment of carbon dioxide (CO2), hydrocarbons (HC) and carbon mon-
oxide (CO) emissions measured during the certification tests,
considering the carbon mass balance in the exhaust gas. Modern
vehicles meet Euro standards (Euro 5 and 6) have low tailpipe CO
and HC emission levels (contributing to approximately 1% of the fuel
consumption). In this sense, CO2 emissions can be considered to be
proportional to the fuel consumed during vehicle's operations. Here
we use both terms interchangeably so any results and conclusions

Pcan be considered to be applicable to any of the two, unless stated
otherwise.

PData from the European Environmental Agency (EEA) for year
2015 [12] have confirmed that OEMs have achieved their 130 gCO2/
km in 2014, and that the average EU emissions of all manufacturers
was 123.4 gCO2/km. In addition, provisional EEA data [13,14] sug-
gests a further decrease as of 120.7 gCO2/km in 2015. The OEMs
have already achieved significant improvements in fuel efficiency.
However, there is extensive criticism on the representativeness of
these figures in terms of real-world CO2 emissions and fuel con-
sumption performance [15]. The difference between the two used to
be estimated of the order of 12(cid:1)20% [16,17] while more recent stud-
ies present even wider differences ranging up to 30% or 40% [18,19].
There is indeed increasing evidence [20(cid:1)28] suggesting that fuel
consumption improvements originate from test-oriented optimiza-
tions and test-related practices rather than from the implementation
of fuel-saving technologies. An official investigation funded by the
French ministry of transport [29] has shown that most of the
reported CO2 values cannot be reproduced under laboratory test
conditions and that a reproduction of the certification test results in
consistently higher CO2 emissions by 15%, on average, with a stan-
dard deviation of 8%. Similar differences (3(cid:1)17%), between declared
CO2 and ex-post NEDC measurements, are reported by other
researchers [30]. Studies show (see Table 1.1) that the offset
between officially reported values and real-world vehicle CO2 emis-
sions is increasing over time.

PThe gap between the certification value and real-world emissions
raises scepticism at multiple levels: policy, industry, market. In
terms of policy, the progress of the EU's commitments and the effec-
tiveness of the measures adopted so far are put into question. For
example, assessing current and planning future policy is hard
because of the divergences in fuel consumption erode a significant
portion of the expected CO2 benefits [32]. However, industry has rec-
ognized that CO2 emissions from road transport have not decreased
as expected [5]. In terms of market impact, targets that were origi-
nally set to be met with the introduction of new technologies (e.g.
introduction of lightweight materials and vehicle electrification)
now misleadingly appear to be achievable only with conventional
approaches, and thus, slowing down innovation [33]. In addition,
new fuel-saving technologies might be less appealing to consumers
when compared to existing widespread and cheaper options because
their fuel consumption reduction potential appears to be smaller.
Furthermore, the consumer labelling legislation requires new cars to
display a label showing their fuel consumption and CO2 emissions in
order to promote efficient vehicles and provide a stimulus for fuel
saving options. According to an EC study [34], it is difficult to fully
quantify the impact of labelling due to the divergence between
actual and communicated fuel consumption value. Inaccurate con-
sumer information or diverging reference fuel consumption values
creates an uneven playing field and masks benefits of certain
vehicles and technologies or overestimates others [35].

PThe increasing divergence between real-world and type-approval
fuel consumption, as well as the difficulty to evaluate the actual
effect of the CO2 reduction technologies, led the EU to review the
type approval procedure for passenger cars and light commercial
vehicles and resulted in the introduction of the new Worldwide har-
monized Light-duty Test Procedure (WLTP). The new test procedure
will be used for the assessment of emissions, including CO2, in the
framework of the type approval of light duty vehicles as of Septem-
ber, 1st, 2017. However, CO2 targets will be still assessed with
respect to NEDC CO2 values [36]. Consequently, the present vehicle
certification test and its shortcomings will remain relevant at least
for another five years.

PA series of factors have been identified that cause the increasing
divergence between the current official fuel consumption and the
one experienced in real-world driving conditions [37]. Due to the
diversity of operating conditions, drivers' behaviour, car usage and
other external factors, it is unlikely that any test protocol, no matter
how carefully designed, will be able to accurately capture the real-
world performance of vehicles. As a result, there will be always a
need to identify which factors influence emissions under real-world
driving conditions and which are captured by the vehicle certifica-
tion tests in order to assess their impact on real-world fuel con-
sumption. Once this impact has been better quantified the real-
certification CO2 gap could be further analysed and broken down to
contributing factors and, if possible, be corrected a posteriori.

PThis paper attempts to address two key questions of concern to
scientists, analysts, policy makers and the public through an exten-
sive literature review of existing publications on the factors affecting
passenger car fuel consumption in real-world driving and laboratory
conditions. The questions are:

P1. Which factors affect the fuel consumption of vehicles and to

what extent?

P2. What would be a realistic estimate of the in-use CO2 emissions

of European passenger cars?

PIn the following sections the factors that affect fuel consumption
and CO2 emissions under real-world driving conditions and labora-
tory tests are categorized as follows:

Pa) factors related to vehicle characteristics and systems. This category
focuses on the main contributors in energy consumption, which
define fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, such as vehicle
mass, vehicle aerodynamics, tyres and auxiliary systems;

Pb) factors related to the environmental and traffic conditions, includ-
ing factors such as weather conditions, road morphology and
traffic conditions;

Pc) factors related to the vehicle driver, such as driving style and vehi-

cle maintenance.

PFinally the influence of vehicle certification test conditions,

boundaries and elasticities are discussed separately.

PThe paper concludes with a consolidation of the information col-
lected on the effect of the various factors, an estimate of the real-
world CO2 emissions of an average European passenger car (as
defined in Table 2.1) and a short discussion on the findings of this
study. It should be noted that specific engine and drivetrain technol-
ogies have not been included and are only discussed in passing,
where they are linked to other vehicle-related factors affecting the
real world-certification gap. This is done for two main reasons. First,
it is hard to identify without detailed modelling tools the differences
in the performance of individual powertrain components, inside or
outside the current vehicle certification test. Second, their effect on
vehicle fuel consumption is high, and hence, it would require a sepa-
rate study in order to describe and present the influence of individ-
ual technologies and components on fuel consumption. In view of
the introduction of the WLTP, we attempt a targeted analysis on the

2. Background

2.1. Regulatory framework

PThe NEDC and the respective test protocol were first introduced
in the seventies for measuring pollutant emissions and not CO2 or
fuel consumption. In the early 1980s, CO2 emissions measurement
was added to the European mandatory vehicle certification process,
also known as Type Approval process (TA). However, no specific lim-
its or targets were set at the time [38]. Curbing CO2 emissions from
road transport, especially passenger cars,1 is a cornerstone of Euro-
pean climate change mitigation policies [40]. In 1995 the EC made a
proposal to set a fleet average CO2 emissions target of 120 g/km for
2005. The subsequent discussions, between the EC and the vehicle
manufacturers, led to a voluntary auto industry commitment (1999)
to achieve fleet average emissions of 140 gCO2/km by 2008 [41];
reductions were monitored via an annual CO2 emissions monitoring
scheme [42]. The failure of the automotive industry to live up to
their commitment led to the addoption of the 2009 European regula-
tion for mandatory CO2 emission limits (EU Regulation 443/2009). A
fleet average mass-dependent CO2 limit of 130 g/km by 2015 was
adopted. Another 10 g of CO2 were expected to be gained from sup-
plementary measures not covered by the type approval test (i.e. bio-
fuels, gearshift indicators, improved air-conditioning systems, driver
education etc), in order to reach overall emission levels of 120 gCO2/
km [9]. Since then the EU implemented a strategy for reducing fur-
ther CO2 emissions and fuel consumption from passenger cars
[43,44] foreseeing compulsory, fleet average and mass dependent
targets of 95 g/km by 2021. Failure of a manufacturer to comply
with mandatory limits results in fines ranging from €5 to €95 per
gram of excess CO2 per vehicle sold.

PThis policy has caused significant changes in the average official
CO2 emisisons and a shift in the major characteristics of European
passenger vehicles over the past decade (see Fig. 2.1), resulting in
2015, in the sales-weighted average characteristics2 that are pre-
sented in Table 2.1 [14]. This has been accompanied by a reduction in
average engine capacity despite the apparent increase in engine
power and is a direct result of engine downsizing for both diesel and
gasoline engines. In constast, mass has remained relatively constant
between 1300 and 1400 kg despite its significance in vehicle energy
consumption. However, there is critiscism of the accuracy of these
CO2 figures and how representative they can be considered in terms
of real-world CO2 and fuel consumption [15,45]. The generic term
Alternative Fuel Vehicles (AFV) refers to vehicles that utilize com-
pressed natural gas, liquified petroleum gas, ethanol, biodiesel and-
other non diesel and petrol fuels. These vehicles are grouped together

1 Similar initiatives have been established for light commercial vehicles, where the
limit values are higher (2017: 175 g/km, 2020: 147 g/km), thus covering the entire
light duty vehicle (LDV) market in the EU. This study focuses on passenger cars only
as their sales (89%) greatly outweigh those of light commercial vehicles (11%) [39].

2 If not mentioned differently, the average CO2 and vehicle characteristics’ values

used in the text hereafter refer to those of Table 2.1.

average vehicle characteristics (b). Chart adapted from [45], data for 2015 estimated
based on the EEA provisional data [14].

Pdue to their low sales volume (»2.7% altogether). Consequently the
steep annual reduction of CO2 emissions in this case, might be a result
of changes in the share of each fuel type within AFV each year. For
example, ethanol vehicles have higher emissions than liquified petro-
leum gas vehicles which, in turn, have a higher market share in the
earlier years [45].

PIn parallel, most major vehicle markets worldwide have adopted
similar CO2 related targets or limits, (see Table 2.2). For comparison
purposes the emission targets in Table 2.2 have been normalized to
NEDC equivalent values3 [46,47].

2.2. Emissions measurements and road load determination

PThe reference methodology for measuring CO2 emissions, the test
cycle (NEDC) [48], test boundary conditions, vehicle set up and
results collection and analysis follow the procedure for pollutant
emissions measurements that was originally established in the early

P1970s. The test procedure has undergone slight modifications since.
Currently it abides to the standard set in the global technical regula-
tion R83 [49] of the World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Reg-
ulations of the United Nations’ Economic Commission for Europe
(UNECE) and is used in the type-approval system of several vehicle
markets in the world (with the exception of US, Japan and Canada).
The NEDC-based procedure for CO2 and fuel consumption measure-
ment is described in UNECE R101 [50].

PThe NEDC consists of mild accelerations and decelerations and
several steady state points which fail to reflect modern driving pat-
terns [51,18]. In addition, the test procedure disregards various real-
world conditions such as additional weight, number of passengers,
use of air conditioning, realistic gear shifting, cold starts, operation
at higher velocities and congestion [52,53] and examines only a
small area of the operating range of the engine [51]. The testing pro-
cedure exhibits unrealistic or loosely defined boundary conditions
such as temperature ranges of 20(cid:1)25 °C, restricted use of auxiliary
systems which are widely used in real driving, lower vehicle mass,
lack of air-conditioning use, unclear or even erroneous definition of
resistances. The combined effects of these factors result in a system-
atic bias in the recording of CO2 emissions.

PThe EU vehicle certification test foresees driving of the vehicle
over the NEDC on a chassis dynamometer, an instrument that simu-
lates the resistive forces imposed on the vehicle technically referred
to as the road loads [54]. The chassis dynamometer consists of a
roller, where the vehicle is placed and stabilized. The roller simulates
road loads according to the test cycle's speed profile. During the test
exhaust emissions are collected into sample bags and are analysed
after the test is completed [54]. The procedure takes place in a test
cell under controllable ambient conditions, in order to deliver accu-
rate and reproducible results. Several other test cycles and accompa-
nying protocols have been proposed as being more representative of
real driving conditions. Most notable are the Artemis cycles [55],
which have served as a basis for emissions performance assessment
and emissions factors development for several years [56,57]. To
address the shortcomings of the existing test procedure and limit
the extent of the gap the new WLTP test procedure, designed at a
global
level [58], will be implemented in the European type-
approval system in 2017. The development of the procedure was
supported by the automotive industry, governmental and non-gov-
ernmental organizations [5]. However, the WLTP is not expected to
change the established CO2 targets or the way policy is being
assessed [59], and a translation of the WLTP into the NEDC-based
system will take place until year 2020. To what extent, and how, the
new procedure will be used in Europe for policy making and vehicle

3 The methodology to estimate the conversion equation was based on the simula-
tion of representative vehicle models over the investigated cycles. Subsequently, the
simulation results were imported in a regression model to estimate the conversion
coefficients.

Plabelling with regards to vehicle fuel consumption and CO2 emis-
sions, remains (as of 2017) unclear.

PThe resistances applied during the NEDC test are determined
through a coast down test which takes place at an outside test-
track prior to the measurement. In this procedure, the vehicle is
accelerated to 120 km/h and then it is allowed to coast down in
neutral gear until it slows down to 20 km/h or until it stops. The
time and vehicle speed is recorded for regular speed intervals
allowing the calculation of the mean deceleration of the vehicle
and the forces (resistances) acting on it. A second order polyno-
mial model is applied in order to describe resistances [60] as
follows.

where:

Pm is vehicle reference mass

ð1Þ

fx are the road load factors (road loads) fitted on the coast down data

PThe model's coefficients f0, f1, f2, referred to as road loads, result
from applying the above equation to the coast down test data; f0
represents the rolling resistance that acts on the vehicle due to the
deformation of the tyres, f1 the resistance that is proportional to
velocity, which mainly originates from internal losses due to rotating
parts of the drivetrain such as the output shaft of the gearbox, and f2
the aerodynamic resistance that is proportional to a vehicle's frontal
area (FA) and aerodynamic resistance factor (Cd) [61].

PRoad loads together with vehicle mass are used for setting up the
test facility (chassis dynamometer) in order to apply the appropriate
resistances during a driving-cycle. Practically, the chassis dynamom-
eter is being calibrated to reproduce the resistances calculated dur-
ing the coast-down test, with few differentiations in the boundary
conditions that are imposed by the respective test procedure (e.g.
the simulated mass is not exactly equal to the reference mass as the
legislation foresees a mass-based binning of vehicles). According to
the NEDC test protocol, in laboratory conditions the total resistance
applied at the wheel of the vehicle should match the sum of resistan-
ces described by Eq. (1). However, in real-world driving additional
resistances and energy losses occur such as, the resistances to climb
up a slope, losses due to auxiliary consumers (e.g. air-conditioning),
and weather conditions. Furthermore, the vehicle mass is rarely
equal to the official reference test-mass, due to the presence of addi-
tional passengers in the vehicle or other factors that increase the
total mass. Such factors are presented in detail in the following para-
graphs.

2.3. Divergence of official and real-world emissions

PVarious studies highlight the inadequacy of the certification test
to simulate real-world vehicle performance [62(cid:1)64,18,65,66], while
the European Automobile Constructors Association (ACEA) points to
the influence of the drivers on the final vehicle CO2 emissions. For
example, two drivers driving the same vehicle under the same con-
ditions are likely to have different CO2 emissions [66]. Meanwhile,
the pressure exerted by European laws for reaching the mandatory
targets has resulted in vehicle OEMs exploiting the margins of the
prescribed test conditions. Such practices have widened the differ-
ence between the official values and those reported in real-world
CO2 measurements (see Table 1.1). As a result the gap between offi-
cially reported and real-world CO2 emissions appears to increase
with time. Fig. 2.2 shows the evolution of the divergence between
official and measured real-world fuel consumption according to

Fig. 2.2. Evolution of the divergence between official and drive “real-world” fuel consumption according to different data sources. Adaptation from [19].

Pdifferent data sources [19]. It is expected that these divergences in
CO2 emissions may appear also in countries where the European test
procedure (e.g. Australia and India) is used, while similar trends are
reported for markets with different certification systems (e.g. US
and China) [67,68].

PSeveral of these (Fig. 2.2) fuel consumption measurements origi-
nate from car magazines or car related portals and websites and can
be questioned as to their scientific merit. However, editors state that
they follow a representative real-world driving pattern, while in
most of the cases the fuel consumption is estimated based on tank
fill-ups at the end of the test and subsequently CO2 emissions are
calculated assuming fixed carbon contents per fuel type [19]. It can
be argued that these datasets are biased. However, all sources pres-
ent the same increasing trend over time and similar relative annual
changes. Based on values reported in previous studies [16,62,69],
the gap in the period 2000(cid:1)2005 was estimated to be 10%, a figure
very similar to the values presented in Fig. 2.2 for the same period
across all datasets. This demonstrates that any bias of these datasets
is probably limited.

PAt this point one should distinguish between reported CO2 emis-
sions used for the assessment of specific policy targets and the fuel
consumption values communicated to the driver of a vehicle. Indeed,
the CO2 emissions are reported for the combined NEDC value and
monitoring is based on this single value that characterizes the vehi-
cle. However, with regard to fuel consumption vehicle labelling
requires that three values for fuel consumption are communicated
to the public corresponding to urban driving cycle (UDC) and the
extra-urban driving cycle (EUDC) together with their combined
(NEDC) value. These three fuel consumption values may vary from
10 to 30% depending on vehicle characteristics for the attributed
fuel consumptions tend to underestimate the equivalent conditions
(e.g. when comparing UDC fuel consumption directly to that experi-
enced over real urban driving).

PIn United States (US), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
revised its type approval procedure in 2008. It now provides two
fuel economy values, expressed in miles per gallon units (MPG)
[70,71]. The first is the fuel economy measured following the official
vehicle test procedure in the laboratory, and it used for monitoring
policy related targets. The second is an adjusted value that is the
combination of
weighted fuel economy measured over

a

Psupplementary tests, in addition to the official test [72]. These sup-
plementary cycles include driving at higher speeds, use of air condi-
tioning and low ambient temperatures. The adjusted fuel economy
values are considered more realistic and are therefore communi-
cated to car buyers. No extensive studies exist on the divergence
between US real-world and laboratory emissions; the US EPA, how-
ever, monitors emissions of in-use vehicles to ensure that they
remain within a margin of 30% of the standard limits [18, 38].

2.4. Eco-innovations

PThe European eco-innovation scheme is set out in legislation [9]
and aims to promote the implementation of innovative technologies
that reduce CO2 emissions in real life and not (or only partially) in
the certification test. Eco-innovation means an innovative technol-
ogy which is accompanied by an EC approved evaluation (experi-
mental or calculated) [74]. Vehicle manufacturers or component
manufacturers can apply for a technology or a combination of tech-
nologies to be granted an eco-innovation status if they prove that
the “innovation” provides benefits of more than 1 gCO2/km com-
pared to the standard technology and fulfils certain applicability cri-
teria such as market penetration,
technology relevance and
accountability [74]. EcoD
X-innovations enable a CO2 emissions dis-
count of up to 7 g/km (at fleet level) depending on their effective-
Xthe performance of an
ness. The latter is considered when assessing D
OEM D

3. Vehicle characteristics and sub-systems

3.1. Mass and road loads

P3.1.1. Vehicle mass

PVehicle mass is one of the main factors influencing a vehicle's fuel
consumption under low velocity driving conditions [76(cid:1)78,80]. The
operating mass of a vehicle consists of: (i) the empty vehicle; (ii) the
fuel in the tank; and (iii) the passengers and cargo. During the cur-
rent European vehicle certification test a single vehicle mass value is
considered (reference mass which is a vehicle empty mass aug-
mented by 100 kg) which is then used to identify a specific inertia
class for running the laboratory CO2 measurement. An increase in
the operating mass increases fuel consumption, as more power
is needed to accelerate the vehicle during acceleration phases and
rolling resistance is also increased proportionally [47(cid:1)49]. Despite
its influence on energy consumption, the average official mass of
vehicles in Europe has remained constant over the past decade
(see Fig. 2.1) stabilizing between 1340 and 1400 kg. This suggests an
inversion of the trend of the previous years that led to continuous
mass increases as vehicles became bigger, safer and incorporated
more driver and passenger aids.

PThere are no common metrics or approaches for the measure-
ment and quantification of the impact of additional mass on fuel
consumption and CO2 emissions of passenger cars. A wide range of
values have been reported with most studies converging on figures
of the order of 5(cid:1)9% (6.5(cid:1)12 g/km over NEDC) for mass additions of
50(cid:1)200 kg over various cycles and operating conditions [50(cid:1)54].

PSeveral studies demonstrate the effect of vehicle weight reduc-
tion on fuel consumption, particularly over vehicle certification con-
ditions. In general, weight reduction is reported to reduce fuel
consumption between 5 and 10% [87,88]. The NEDC [89] reports a
linear relationship between mass reduction and fuel consumption
reduction with a 5%(cid:1)10% decrease in vehicle weight leading to
decreases between 1.3(cid:1)1.8% and 2.7(cid:1)3.6%, respectively. Approxi-
mately a 0.6% reduction is achieved for each 1% saving in total vehi-
cle mass [90]. A 100 kg reduction represents fuel savings of
0.3(cid:1)0.5 l/100 km (6%(cid:1)10% for a fuel consumption of 5 l/100 km)
[91] while a 100 kg increase in mass is reported by Mickunaitis et al.
[92] to increase fuel consumption by 6.5% (petrol cars) and 7.1% (die-
sel cars) [92]. Similar ranges are reported also in US vehicles with a
10% reduction in weight estimated to deliver a 5% improved fuel
economy [93].

PConsidering the effect of mass over real-world driving, an addi-
tional 100 kg can increase fuel consumption by an average 5(cid:1)7% for
a medium-sized car of 1500 kg [83]. In absolute numbers, an addi-
tional 100 kg load is reported to cause an increase from 0.3 to
0.5 l/100 km (7.5(cid:1)12.5 gCO2/km) [94(cid:1)98].

PWeight reduction is also linked to powertrain characteristics
such as engine power. With lighter vehicles and improvements in
component efficiency, the peak power requirement of powertrains
could further be reduced over time [99] leading to improvements in
fuel consumption. A 10% weight reduction can improve fuel econ-
omy by 4(cid:1)8%, depending on whether or not the engine is downsized
to maintain the same acceleration performance [100].

PFrom a load carrying capacity perspective, which is more relevant
for light goods vehicles, an increase of a vehicle's mass equal to 50%
of its load carrying capacity results in an average increase of fuel
consumption of about 5.6%, with a scatter not greater than §1.2%
[63]. Fig. 3.1 summarizes the effect of vehicle weight on fuel con-
sumption as found in the literature.

PAt this point it should be noted that not all literature sources
make clear reference to the reference vehicle mass considered during
the measurements or the calculations of fuel consumption. In most
cases discrete mass increases are reported together with their effect
on CO2 emissions. These discrete increases make sense for passenger

Pcars, where the vehicle is used for transporting passengers rather
than goods. In real life, the factor causing the greatest variation in
passenger vehicle weight is the number of passengers, also referred
to as the occupancy rate. A high occupancy rate reduces the CO2
emissions per passenger-kilometre, which is desirable from an envi-
ronmental perspective, and is examined separately.

P3.1.2. Aerodynamic resistance

PVehicle aerodynamic resistance is one of the primary factors
influencing fuel consumption over high speed driving conditions
[101,79] and is expressed as a function of the square of vehicle's
velocity and proportional to the product of aerodynamic drag coeffi-
cient (Cd), frontal area (A) and air density (r).

PThe aerodynamic drag coefficient is affected by the design of the
car. Increases in the Cd x A product, hence forward referred to as
aerodynamic drag, induced either by changes in the size of the vehi-
cle or in its shape and aerodynamic design, translate directly into
increased aerodynamic resistance, and thus, to decreased fuel econ-
omy and higher CO2 emissions. Aerodynamic resistance improve-
ment by 20% can result in fuel consumption reduction over NEDC of
about 3(cid:1)7% [102]; reductions of 5% and 10% in aerodynamic resis-
tance could lead to a decrease of CO2 emissions for NEDC of about
0.6(cid:1)1.2% and 1.2(cid:1)2.4% respectively [89].

PImprovements of aerodynamic characteristics reduce the aerody-
namic drag and increase vehicle stability by alleviating lift and side
forces [79]. Focusing on the improvement of vehicle aerodynamic
losses during the design and manufacturing process in the past deca-
des has resulted in the reduction of the vehicle drag coefficient
[100]. However, a continuous increase in vehicle dimensions has off-
set much of these resistance benefits as the frontal area of the
vehicles has also increased [103].

PAerodynamic resistance under real-world driving conditions
is also affected by various vehicle elements and different shape con-
figurations [104], which are not necessarily captured by the
current vehicle certification procedure. Even small modifications can
increase vehicle aerodynamic resistance leading to measureable
changes in fuel consumption. It is estimated that an increase of the
order of 10 to 20% can result in 2(cid:1)4% additional fuel consumption in
highway operation [16]. Achieving drag coefficients of 0.24 in the

Ppossibly non representative for modern vehicles. It is possible that
the practice of certain drivers of adding retrofit aerodynamic devices
on their vehicles for enhancing down-force and stability at high
speed driving actually increases fuel consumption. No studies on the
topic were found.

P3.1.3. Rolling resistance and tyres

PRolling resistance refers to the energy loss occurring in the tyre
due to the deformation of the contact area and the damping proper-
ties of the rubber [79]. The resistance in vehicle motion induced by
the tyre's deformation is proportional to the vertical force applied
on the tyre due to vehicle weight and to the rolling resistance coeffi-
cient. The rolling resistance coefficient is a dimensionless quantity
that is considered as constant or as proportional to vehicle velocity.
Rolling resistance is frequently expressed in mass per mass units
(kg/t). Many factors [61] influence rolling resistance tyre properties
such vehicle velocity, temperature, tyre type and size. Rolling resis-
tance of tyres under NEDC conditions is reported to account for
20(cid:1)25% of total vehicle energy loss [109]. Reported reductions in
rolling resistance are of the order of 5(cid:1)30% (see Fig. 3.3) which leads
to fuel consumption improvements of 1(cid:1)3.5%. Not all reference
sources use the same drive cycles or make reference to the same
vehicle operating conditions and in most cases the absolute or rela-
tive values of the rolling resistance examined is not mentioned.
Hence a more refined comparison is difficult to make.

PDue to their influence on the fuel consumption of vehicles, tyres
are officially categorized in energy efficiency classes (see Table 3.1)
based on their measured rolling resistance. The European Regulation
[110] lays down a scale of classes based on the rolling resistance
coefficient (RRC). The classes range from A being the most efficient
to G the least efficient. For a passenger car, category A tyres have a
RRC of less than 6.5, while a category G tyre has a RRC of more than
12.1. The variation in RRC can reach 90%, where such a difference in
RRC could result in a consumption increase of 7.5% [111]. Choosing
tyres of the next higher energy class can signify a reduction in rolling
resistance of the order of 10(cid:1)15%, which translates to a reduction of
fuel consumption of approximately 1(cid:1)1.5% [89,112]. Maximum RRC
limits are foreseen for passenger car tyres sold in Europe post-2016.
The value of rolling resistance should not exceed 12 kg/t for
all(cid:1)season tyres and 13 kg/t for snow tyres from November 2016
and 10.5 kg/t and 11.5 kg/t respectively from November 2018 [113].
It is estimated, based on tyre sales, that the average RRC of the tyres

mum(cid:1)maximum values. The references cited in this figure are [16,63,89,108].

Pnear future is plausible and could lead to savings of approximately
1.6 l/100 km over motorway driving (130 km/h) [105].

PFig. 3.2 presents a summary of the findings of the effect of air

drag changes on fuel consumption.

PAir density, which varies depending on altitude and ambient con-
ditions, influences fuel consumption but is not directly related to the
aerodynamic design of the vehicle as will be presented onwards.

PFinally, one issue that is referenced in non-scientific literature is
the addition of designed devices such as spoilers [106,107], vortex
generators [108] or combinations of the two for improving the aero-
dynamics of passenger cars. The latter devices can reduce aerody-
namic resistance between 1 and 7% [106(cid:1)108]. However, given the
importance CO2 emissions have gained in recent years it is likely
that vehicle manufacturers have already exploited most of the bene-
fits obtainable by an improved aerodynamic design or the addition
of simple aerodynamic add-ons. Hence such improvements are

Psold in the EU 1was 9.25 kg/t (class E tyres) in 2015 presenting an
improvement compared to 2013 (9.5 kg/t) due to the introduction of
the labelling scheme [114].

PThe tyres sold with the vehicle are not necessarily of the same
energy efficiency class as the tyres that were fitted during certifica-
tion. The vehicle during coast down should be equipped with the
widest tyre and if more than three tyre sizes are available, the sec-
ond widest should be chosen [48]. In general, the wider the tyre the
higher is its rolling resistance. Nevertheless, this does not define the
energy class of a tyre, so the widest class “A” tyre can be chosen
while a vehicle is sold with a narrower tyre of a lower energy class.
It is expected that most vehicles when undergoing the type approval
procedure are equipped with a high energy class tyre (A or B) while
the majority of vehicles are sold with tyres of lower energy class.
This situation creates a discrepancy between the certified and the
in-use fuel consumption because the assumed rolling resistance dur-
ing the certification test is different from the one actually occurring
on the road. An increase of 20% in rolling resistance, which corre-
sponds to a change from tyre of energy class A to a tyre of energy
class C, can increase fuel consumption by 2% [115]. This situation is
expected to improve with the introduction of the WLTP which stipu-
lates that a vehicle shall be measured with the best and worst case
tyres. When the same vehicle is sold with tyres belonging to an
intermediate RRC class the fuel consumption should be corrected
accordingly via linear interpolation of the two limit values.

PAn important issue relates to the use of replacement tyres. The
majority of aftersales tyres (replacement tyres) in the EU falls within
classes C and E [116] with the penetration of higher energy class
tyres in the market remaining as low as 1% [114]. The average annual
mileage of a passenger car is estimated to be 14,000 km [117], thus
over a 10 year period and until a vehicle is retired, three to five sets
of tyres are replaced. This tendency of European drivers to choose
low energy class tyres contributes in the widening of the gap. On
the other hand, important benefits in real world CO2 emissions
can be gained, relatively easily, by promoting replacement tyres of
higher energy class in existing, older model-year vehicles.

PWinter tyres, which are mandatory during winter season in some
European countries (e.g. Germany) [118], also exhibit higher rolling
resistance compared to regular tyres and lead to an increase in fuel
consumption [119]. Winter tyres of the same characteristics and size
can be to be one or two energy efficiency classes lower. A 1 kg/t dif-
ference between all weather and winter tyres foreseen by the legis-
lation for maximal allowed values [114]. This can lead to increases of
the order of 2(cid:1)3%. It is expected that winter tyre RRC will improve
with time as does RRC of regular tyres.

P3.1.4. Factors affecting both mass and road loads

PThe factors discussed below present two distinct characteristics.
Their effect on fuel consumption can be attributed to more than one
factor, namely changes in mass and road loads. In addition, their
contribution to the real world fuel consumption cannot be easily
captured with simple fuel consumption reporting or tests such as
those used for producing the data of Fig. 2.2. Hence, a wide variation
in test conditions and eventually the reported impacts on fuel con-
sumption should be expected.

P3.1.4.1. Trailer towing.
PTrailer towing affects both the total mass and
the road loads of the vehicle leading to increased fuel consumption.
The total mass is increased due to the additional weight of the trailer
and its load, while the extra wheels introduce additional rolling
resistance. Vehicle aerodynamic resistance is also influenced by the
trailer, which can increase both the frontal area and the drag coeffi-
cient [120]. The driving style is also adjusted to the towing condi-
tions. In general, towing causes a reduction in vehicle speed and
leads to a milder driving. The reduced speed counterbalances
the effect of deteriorated aerodynamics. Finally, additional energy
is needed for lights and other trailer accessories.

PThe increase in fuel consumption due to towing was examined in
a study [121] in which a passenger car was tested towing an
unloaded trailer and the same trailer loaded at 60% of full load
capacity. The total weight of the empty trailer was 310 kg and
564 kg including the 60% capacity load. Tests were carried out at
speeds ranging from 70 to 90 km/h. The vehicle mass was 1408 kg
with a 2.15 m2 frontal area and the trailer had a length of 4.3 m and
a width of 2.2 m. The height of the trailer was minimal and its frontal
area was within the frontal area of the vehicle, so any effect on aero-
dynamic resistance is expected to be limited. Fuel consumption was
correlated to vehicle speed and resulted in an increase from 33% to
43% for the unloaded trailer and from 37% to 45% for the loaded
trailer for the tested speed range. Experiments performed [122] on a
Sports Utility Vehicle (4.0 L V6 engine, 2268 kg, 2.53 m2 frontal area)
towing a trailer of 1588 kg total weight, width of 1.83 m and height
of 1.83 m revealed similar trends but higher increases compared to
the reference test performed without the trailer. The frontal area
was increased by 37% (to 3.47 m2) when towing. Fig. 3.4 presents the
fuel consumption in comparison to the standard configuration in the
two cases.

P3.1.4.2. Roof rack and roof box.
PRoof racks act as the basis for attach-
ing a roof box (i.e. luggage box, ski boxes or for other equipment).
Although roof racks usually serve as a basis for installing a roof box,
they can be also found as a stand-alone component. Their installa-
tion worsens the aerodynamic resistance of the vehicle and leads to
increases in fuel consumption estimated of the order of 1(cid:1)3% for a
speed range of 70(cid:1)90 km/h [121].

Fig. 3.5. Percentage increase in fuel consumption for a non-laden roof box. The references cited in this figure are [82,121,122,124,125,206,207].

PA roof box increases the aerodynamic resistance and mass of
the vehicle leading to an increase in fuel consumption. The addi-
tion of a roof box on a roof rack increases vehicle frontal area
between 0.22 and 0.45 m2 and increases vehicle aerodynamic
drag [123]. The average increase in frontal area is estimated to
be 0.37 m2or 15% for an average European passenger car. Apart
from the effect on aerodynamics, the additional average weight
of the empty roof box is estimated at 15 kg, and hence, has a
marginal effect on fuel consumption. During motorway condi-
tions at 120 km/h a non(cid:1)laden roof rack can on average increase
fuel consumption by 7.5% [124]. Depending on conditions and
box type, the effect of non-laden roof boxes is reported to be of
the order of 5(cid:1)14% compared to the fuel consumption measured
without the box (see Fig. 3.5).

PTaking into consideration an average maximum load of 60 kg
[123], a laden roof box increases the mass of the vehicle on average
by 75 kg resulting in a 5.5% mass increase for a vehicle with 1360 kg
mass, equal to the weight of an average passenger. According to the
values presented in Fig. 3.1, this can increase consumption between
by 2 to 5%., without taking into consideration the impact on air drag.
A study [125] observed an increase between 20 and 30% for a loaded
roof box in highway operation, without specifying the average
speed of the vehicle. Regarding the combined effect of weight and
aerodynamic resistance increase due to a laden roof box, an effect
ranging from 5 to 25% depending on the vehicle speed was found
averaging at about 15% for speeds between 100 and 120 km/h (see
Fig. 3.6).

PVarious items such as taxi signs and advertis-
P3.1.4.3. Roof add-ons.
ing signs attached on a car can also increase the frontal area, drag
coefficient and fuel consumption (see Table 3.2). Based on the find-
ings of Chowdhury et al. [104] the combined effect on fuel consump-
tion was calculated for an average (see Table 2.1) European gasoline
vehicle under realistic driving conditions.

PThe literature reviewed did not provide information to cover in
full detail the effects of these add-ons individually. Nonetheless,
vehicles with add-ons are expected to circulate in an urban environ-
ment with low relative speeds, where the effect of aerodynamics on
fuel consumption and CO2 emissions is minimal.

3.2. Auxiliary systems

PThe auxiliary systems of a car comprise of all the elements that
improve driving safety and comfort. This however at the cost of an
increased electrical, or mechanical power supply that in turn
increase fuel consumption [126,86]. The main vehicle systems
reported in literature are:

P(cid:3) Air conditioning systems;
P(cid:3) Heating systems;
P(cid:3) Steering assist systems; and
P(cid:3) Other electrical consumers and auxiliaries (e.g. headlights,

windscreen wipers, heated seats).

the

European certification conditions. During

PVehicle's auxiliaries were found to represent 3.2% of the fuel con-
sumption over the NEDC [127], a rather high value considering offi-
official
cial
certification test eventually the vehicle battery is fully charged, so
no engine power is directed to electric components, and auxiliary
components operate at the lowest power consumption level possible
(see paragraph 6.1D
X). The additional fuel consumption induced by
auxiliary systems in real world conditions is estimated to be of the
order of 3% [128], with the air-conditioning effect not taken into
consideration. Other studies do not quantify the impact of auxiliary
systems on fuel consumption but attempt to quantify fuel savings
gained by the application of certain technologies like the full electri-
fication of auxiliary systems. The latter is reported to reduce fuel
consumption by 3% (gasoline and diesel) [129], a figure that is proba-
bly overestimated given the findings of the studies presented previ-
ously.

PIn terms of absolute energy consumption induced by auxiliary
systems, a wide range of values is reported by Carlson et al. [130]
over chassis dyno tests, ranging from 135 W to 1200 W, depending
on the test cycle investigated. In the same study, the required on-
road auxiliary load over 12 months, for a variety of ambient and
driving conditions, was calculated to be between 310 and 640 W.
The electric power demands of auxiliary systems and other compo-
nents are expected to increase in the future bringing current 12 V
electrical systems to their limits of operation [131]. The total electric
loads of present vehicles can reach up to 2.2 kW but could increase
to 4.2 kW in the future pushing the need to adopt 48 V systems to
handle higher loads with lower electric currents, and hence, with
less power lost due to Joule heating. According to K€uhnlenz [131]
48 V systems can replace 12 V systems by 2030, facilitating also a
transition to mild hybrid vehicles.

P3.2.1. Air conditioning (cooling)

POne of the most influential factors affecting real-world fuel
consumption is the operation of Air Conditioning (A/C) systems
[132,16,133(cid:1)136,130]. While in 1993 the share of cars sold with
A/C as standard was ca. 10%, it is reported to have risen to 85%
by 2011 [137]. Although it was estimated in 2002 that by 2014
the majority of the vehicles sold in the European, American and

PAsian markets would be equipped with A/C systems [138], the
use of A/C is not included in the present (NEDC) or future (WLTP
as of 2017) European type approval tests, but is considered for
future inclusion.

PThe effect A/C use on fuel consumption depends mainly on the
desired interior temperature [130] and ambient conditions (temper-
ature, air humidity and solar radiation) and to a lesser extent on
other aspects such as speed and driving patterns [139]. Because of
this weak connection to traffic conditions, the additional litres of
fuel per hour of driving (l/h) is proposed [135,139] as the most
appropriate metric for quantifying the impact of A/C on fuel con-
sumption, instead of a percentile increase. Some researchers, how-
ever, claim a stronger connection between traffic conditions and the
additional fuel consumption induced by the A/C operation, with the
relative influence being reduced as vehicle speed increases (4%, 2.5%,
and 1% for urban, rural and motorway driving respectively [140]).
This observation does not necessarily contradict the fixed fuel con-
sumption-per-driving-hour approach; increased fuel consumption
at high speed conditions reduces the relative fuel losses resulting
from the A/C system.

PThere is a lack of consensus on the measurement conditions
and the reporting of the impact of A/C on fuel consumption.
Measured [133] CO2 emissions of an air conditioned vehicle
without any heat soaking and of a vehicle exposed to solar radia-
tion of 850 W/m2 resulted in increases in CO2 emissions over
NEDC of 2056 gCO2/h (an additional consumption of 0.85 l/h).
Similarly an increase in fuel consumption of 1 l/h is reported in
[141] but without making explicit reference to the conditions of
A/C operation. Certain studies report the effect of A/C on a
l/100 km basis. According to [139], fuel consumption increases
and exceeds 1 l/100 km at high load points, which are rare in
real-world driving conditions, and the same study recommends
common guidelines for determining A/C effect. An average
increase of 1.25 l/100 km was found over the NEDC in an EU
funded project [142] aiming to develop a common type approval
procedure for A/C systems. Finally, relative increases of 14%, 10%
and 11% for the urban, highway and combined cycle respectively
have been reported [143] (see Table 3.3).

PThe type of A/C, manual or automatic, has an impact on fuel con-
sumption. Manual A/C are considered systems that operate continu-
ously while automatic A/C try to maintain a predefined cabin
temperature. Tests of the effect of manual and automatic A/C at
50 km/h and 100 km/h showed that the impact on CO2 emissions is
higher in manual A/C than in automatic ones and that, similarly to

Pwhat has already been discussed, the overall impact is lower at a
speed of 100 km/h than at 50 km/h [144,145].

PFor hybrid vehicles the relative effect of A/C operation is reported
to be higher compared to conventional vehicles, an expected out-
come as hybrid vehicles present much lower fuel consumption.
Comparing a conventional (1406 kg, 3000 cc) against a hybrid vehi-
cle (907 kg, 1300 cc), [146] performed tests over the US SFTP SC03
Supplemental Federal Test Procedure, which is a sub-cycle of the
FTP-75 test cycle where the A/C is turned on, at an ambient tempera-
ture of 35 °C. Fuel consumption increased from 10.7 l/100 km to
14.7 l/100 km and from 2.77 l/100 km to 6.57 l/100 km for the con-
ventional and the hybrid vehicle respectively.

PRegarding the contribution of specific A/C components in the
additional energy demand, Nielsen et al. [147] reports that 175 W of
the A/C imposed electrical load can be attributed to the cooling fan
and the clutch operation of the compressor, while another 475 W of
the mechanical load can be attributed to the energy needs of the
compressor. Experimenting with various improvements they have
achieved a 46% reduction in the electrical load and a 27% in the
mechanical load.

PFig. 3.7 provides a summary of the results retrieved from the vari-
ous sources. In order to normalize the findings, an average speed of
100 km/h was assumed for calculating the respective values. Differ-
ent studies consider different assumptions regarding the ambient-
cabin temperature; it has not been possible to take those into con-
sideration.

P3.2.2. Heating (electric heating or A/C)

PRecent improvements in engine fuel efficiency have reduced the
performance of the vehicle heating system, due to lower engine heat
rejection to the coolant, for systems that rely on engine heat to
maintain cabin temperature or remove the vapour from vehicle

Pwindscreens. Missing heat is compensated by electric heating which
in turn leads to an increase in electric power demand [148]. Such
systems may require an additional 400(cid:1)2000 W [149] of electric
power to operate. The additional power requirement has an impact
on fuel consumption, with an increase of 600 W resulting in fuel
consumption increases of 5(cid:1)10% (about 6(cid:1)12 gCO2/km for a 2015
average car) over the NEDC [150].

PA study [148] examined the operation of heating systems for
various outside temperatures and found that their use in Frank-
furt (Germany) resulted in an increase in fuel consumption of
0.15 l/100 km and 0.25 l/100 km (3.7(cid:1)6.2 gCO2/km), which corre-
sponds to 2.6% and 4.4% respectively for an average European
car. It is expected that hybrid electric vehicles, which exhibit
prolonged periods of engine shut-off, are affected more by the
operation of heaters in terms of available range in electric mode
and fuel consumption.

P3.2.3. Steering assist systems

PSteering assist systems contribute to driving safety and comfort,
but they also require an additional energy supply that results in
increased fuel consumption. Steering action is considered rare com-
pared to the total vehicle operating time. In typical highway travel
the power steering assisted system can remain idle for about 76% of
the time [151].

PThere are three types of steering assist systems [152]: Hydraulic
Power assisted Steering (HPS); Electro(cid:1)Hydraulic Power assisted
Steering (EHPS); and Electric Power assisted Steering (EPS). HPS has
been the main power assisting system for many years and is pow-
ered by the combustion engine belt drive, even when in standby
hence it is a significant energy consumer. In recent years, there has
been an effort to implement power-on-demand type of systems that
led to the evolution of EHPS, a partially on-demand system, and EPS.

values that are not expressed in l/100 km. The references cited in this figure are [16,94,128,135,136,140,143(cid:1)145,163,209].

PIn EHPS the hydraulic pump is driven by operating an electric motor
that has a lower power demand. In contrast, the EPS steering assis-
tance comes directly from an electric motor, which is only activated
when power assistance is required, resulting in lower energy con-
sumption [153]. In terms of required power, HPS can demand
»270 W, EHPS »38 W and EPS »18 W [154]. The HPS system may
cause an 8% increase in fuel consumption with the EHPS and EPS a
2% and less than 1% increase, respectively [152]. According to [16],
electrical power steering increases fuel consumption by 2(cid:1)3%, a
value that lies probably in the high range considering modern
vehicles.

PSince the HPS is the most fuel inefficient system it has been sug-
gested [151] that the use of EHPS is needed, where HPS pump is dis-
connected by an electromagnetic clutch when steering is not
required. On-road measurements on vehicles featuring these sys-
tems showed a decrease of 5% and 4.1% for highway and urban driv-
ing accordingly compared to normal use of the HPS system. The
overall decrease in the NEDC was 3.9%, where the decrease was
higher in the UDC than the EUDC, 4.8% and 2.7% respectively. This
suggests that the steering system can have a measureable impact on
vehicle certification CO2 emissions.

PBased on the data collected, the operation of the steering assist
system can increase fuel consumption by 1(cid:1)2%. Part of this extra
fuel consumption is possibly also captured during the vehicle certifi-
cation test despite the lack of actual steering. Steering is fundamen-
tal under real-world operation therefore the impact of driving
assistance systems on CO2 emissions cannot be avoided. No specific
study was found that quantifies the contribution of the steering
assist system over the European vehicle certification fuel consump-
tion test. Further investigation is therefore necessary to provide
accurate estimates.

P3.2.4. Other electrical consumers and auxiliaries

PComponents and devices such as lights, pumps or the ventilator,
monitors and sound systems, can be classified in this category. These
require additional electric energy to operate and hence result in
increased fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. Systems such as
engine and vehicle control units, fuel pumps and injection systems,
various sensors (i.e. gas, speed, temperature, force and torque, etc.)
are excluded as they affect fuel consumption under any driving con-
ditions and it is difficult to distinguish potential CO2 increases they
impose over real driving compared to the vehicle certification test
[155,156].

PDuring the past 40 years there has been a trend towards a higher
in-use electrical power demand, which in the case of the US market,
appears to be increasing since 2005 [156]. Such trends are expected
also for the European passenger cars as new and more sophisticated
auxiliary systems such as GPS, air cleaning, air conditioning, adap-
tive cruise control, collision warning and avoidance systems are
introduced in the fleet [155]. Such devices impose higher electrical
loads resulting in increased alternator operation, which in turn
increases the engine power demand and subsequent fuel consump-
tion. Officially, the total electrical power requirements of a European
passenger car over real-world driving are estimated to be 750 W
[157]. This figure is lower compared to the 2500 W reported for US
vehicles [156] but still higher than the 350 W estimate for the Euro-
pean vehicle certification test [157]. Only limited use of electrical
consumers takes place during the European vehicle certification test
and some OEM experts suggest that 350 W might be an overesti-
mated value and that 150 W is a more representative one [158]. This
discrepancy, however, suggests a measureable shortfall between
type approval and real-world consumption. In addition to the above
a standard practice, in the present certification scheme, is to run the
test with battery fully charged, hence the operation of the alternator
is restricted further increasing the deviation between real fuel con-
sumption.

increase fuel

PEstimates on the effect of electrical systems on fuel consumption
and CO2 emissions diverge. Johnson [159] claimed that the use of
accessories can increase fuel consumption by 2.8% (3.6 gCO2/km for
a 2014 vehicle), while a research found that a vehicle with all electri-
cal systems switched on can present an increase of up to 16% or
about 20 g/km of CO2 in terms of certification values [18]. A study
[160] regarding lighting equipment found that complete lighting
functions (i.e. Xenon headlamps, front position bulbs, rear LED
lamps, licence plate bulbs and interior lights) requiring 144 W of
electric power
consumption by 0.14 l/100 km
(3.5 gCO2/km). Older lighting equipment technology used during
the 1980s led to an increase between 0.18 and 0.28 l/100 km
(4.5(cid:1)7 gCO2/km). The use of LED headlamps in the future can
decrease power demand as they are more efficient. The use of day-
time running light can also increase fuel consumption by 0.28 l/
100 km (7 gCO2/km). This was one of the main arguments against
the mandatory adoption of this technology, a measure proposed by
the EC in 2008 [161,162]. Fig. 3.8 presents the power needs and the
potential increase in fuel consumption of various auxiliaries. Based
on these results in a rainy, winter, night scenario (i.e. where use of
headlights, windscreen wiper, rear window heating and wiper and
electrical booster heater is assumed) a car would consume 1.5 l/
100 km more fuel, an increase of 26% compared to the official value
for an average European car.

P3.2.5. Eco-innovations related to electrical systems

PThe EC has approved the implementations of innovative low-
energy consuming vehicle technologies. These can be categorized
into three groups: LED lighting; solar photovoltaic roofs; and effi-
cient alternators.

PRegarding LED lights, various applicants have demonstrated
that LED lights were more efficient compared to standard lights,
such as halogen headlights [164(cid:1)167]. The average benefits in
CO2 emissions from this technology are expected to be about
1 gCO2/km. As of 2016, many new European cars are fitted with
this technology.

PSolar roof systems have been awarded an eco-innovative status
[168,169] and such systems utilize a photovoltaic panel that is
attached to the roof and charges an on-board battery. The stored
electricity is then used for powering various electric systems of the
vehicle and can result in direct savings due to reduce electric power
demand. The expected benefits in terms of real world CO2 reductions
are estimated at 2 gCO2/km.

PVarious high efficient alternator implementations (See Table 3.4)
have also been granted eco-innovation status. In this case, a compar-
ison was conducted with a baseline alternator exhibiting 67%

Pefficiency over the NEDC, a value that is assumed representative for
new passenger cars. The average benefits in CO2 emissions from this
technology are expected to be about 1(cid:1)2 gCO2/km.

3.3. Friction and lubricants

PIt is estimated that up to 25% of fuel energy spent during the
vehicle certification test is consumed to overcome the friction
of the car's components, which refers to the engine, transmis-
sion and brakes. According to [175], a passenger car consumes
on average 340 l of fuel annually to overcome friction for an
average mileage of 13,000 km. The most common technology
option for reducing friction in the vehicle's mechanical parts is
the use of lubricants with low viscosity. A lubricant's viscosity
should be:

P(cid:3) Low enough for the lubricant to flow to the parts that need it;

and

P(cid:3) High enough for the lubricant to form a protective film between
the surfaces it is supposed to protect from contact. This lubrica-
tion film must have the appropriate properties to withstand
the loads and pressures occurring between the surfaces.

PWhen viscosity is lower than necessary, the film formed by the
lubricant will not provide sufficient protection for the moving parts.
This can result in increased friction, wear, heating and oxidation.
When viscosity is higher than necessary problems may also occur.
Inadequate flow could lead to increased drag and friction leading to
higher operating temperatures and energy consumption. Low vis-
cosity lubricants maintain their ability to protect the mechanical
parts of the vehicle. Therefore the characterization of a lubricant as
low-viscosity or energy efficient has to take place considering the
type, characteristics and the operation of the respective mechanical
component.

PAccording to literature,

low friction lubricants
decreases fuel consumption [94,175(cid:1)179]. This effect seems to be
greater in the urban than in the suburban cycle [177]. An average
improvement in fuel consumption is estimated at about 4% and

the use of

Palternating motor oil of high and low viscosity between summer and
winter seasons could also contribute to decreased fuel consumption
[180].

PMotor oil viscosity is inversely dependent on temperature: the
higher the temperature, the lower the viscosity but the measure of
viscosity decrease is important. At low ambient temperatures lower
viscosity allows easier engine cranking and starting, rapid oil distri-
bution in various components and lower friction losses. At normal
engine operating temperatures (T>90 °C) viscosity should be in the
proper range to maintain good lubrication characteristics, minimize
oil consumption and friction losses [181]. For a cold start cycle such
as the NEDC, normal operating temperature is reached close to the
end of the test (1180 s), while it could take longer in congested traf-
fic [182]. During the warm up phase the fuel consumption is affected
by the rate of viscosity decrease with temperature. A 5W-30 oil at
30 °C fuel consumption can be up to 20% higher than at 80 °C [183].
Another study [184] focuses on the effect of oil temperature on fuel
consumption over the NEDC for initial ambient temperatures of 25
and ¡7 °C. The higher viscosity of the oil at ¡7 °C resulted in signifi-
cant increases of about 15% compared to 25 °C ambient temperature.
Fig. 3.9 summarizes the findings regarding the impact of lubricant
on fuel consumption.

PIt is expected that for the vehicle certification test, OEMs use the
most appropriate and fuel efficient lubricants exploiting any poten-
tial CO2 benefit. The same practice is advisable for in-use operation
but cannot be guaranteed. It is up to the driver or the car owner to
follow the manufacturer's suggestion regarding the replacement/
use of fuel efficient engine lubricants

3.4. Maintenance and ageing

P3.4.1. Tyre maintenance and pressure

PIn addition to tyre category and characteristics, tyre condition
and maintenance can also influence the RRC. While tyre wear may
reduce the RRC it is also associated with loss in grip and other unde-
sirable characteristics that can make tyres unsafe and dangerous to
use [185]. It is difficult to assess these influences on fuel consump-
tion. Tyre wear control is part of the mandatory technical inspection

Pof European cars that is performed on a biannual basis [186]. The
most important aspect of proper tyre maintenance is tyre pressure
control.

PAgeing, accumulated mileage and temperature variations can
lead to pressure losses. Low tyre pressure results in higher rolling
resistance [16,187], directly increasing fuel consumption [188,189].
All tyres have a designated operating pressure and deviating from it
affects their rolling resistance. Fig. 3.10 demonstrates how rolling
resistance and fuel consumption can be linked to tyre pressure, mak-
ing use of data reported in [61]. The effect of pressure on rolling
resistance is not linear with deflations of 0.3 bar causing increases of
6%, while deflations of 1 bar causing increases of 30%. The same
study found that 21% of the French vehicles had under-inflated tyres

Fig. 3.10. Evolution of tyre rolling resistance as a function of tyre pressure. Base roll-
ing resistance equals 100%, measured at 2.1 bar according to ISO 8767 (Adapted from
Michelin [61]).

Pby 0.3 and 0.5 bar while a 35% had underinflated tyres by more than
0.5 bar below the recommended pressure. Only 32% of the vehicles
had pressure levels within the recommended range and 12% had
over inflated tires by 1 bar reducing rolling resistance by 20% in the
expense of tire life.

PA study [122] examined the effect of low tyre pressure on fuel
consumption over constant speed conditions in a range between
64 and 129 km/h with an 8 km/h interval and found a 6(cid:1)10%
(0.40(cid:1)0.46 l/100 km) increase in fuel consumption. An average
under-inflation of 0.18 bar results in a 0.7% increase in fuel con-
sumption in a city and 1% on a highway [190]. Fig. 3.11 presents a
summary of the findings of tyre pressure effect on fuel consumption.
PDue to the influence of tyre pressure on fuel consumption and
safety all new passenger car models released in the United States
(from 2008), and the European Union (from 2012) must be equipped
with a tyre pressure monitoring system (TPMS). The extent of the
availability of technology in the EU is presently unknown. In addi-
tion, no studies were found regarding how much drivers respond to
the indications of the TPMS or whether tyre deflation has been
improved.

P3.4.2. Other factors

POther factors related to vehicle maintenance and condition may
also affect fuel consumption in real-world driving conditions. In par-
ticular, wheel misalignment, suspension system maintenance and
air filter clogging.

PWheel alignment is the adjustment of the tyre's camber, toe and
caster angles to ensure that the vehicle is not deviating from its
direction [191]. Misaligned wheels can increase fuel consumption by
increasing hysteresis losses [16,137,192,193] by up 3% for a 2 mm of
toe misalignment [194]. In some extreme cases, it is suggested that
wheel misalignment can reduce tyre life from 80,000 km down to

Pcreates a layer of water that the wheels have to overcome and
increases road loads and hence fuel consumption. A limited number
of studies have quantified the effect of rain and wet roads on fuel
consumption. A study [211] examined the effect of water presence
on the fuel consumption of real vehicles travelling under transient
conditions. Tests in two flat routes with water depths of 1, 2 and
4 mm were compared against tests on a dry road surface and con-
cluded that the fuel consumption in each case increased by 30%, 90%
and 80% respectively. Fuel consumption was found to be higher for
2 mm than 4 mm depths because of the reduced vehicle speed at
4 mm caused by the increased amount of rain and reduced visibility.
A US study regarding heavy-duty vehicles (HDV) also indicates that
fuel consumption increases [212] with rain. Snow and ice can also
increase fuel consumption. The wheels can slip on the road wasting
energy as they have reduced grip, while driving speeds are lower
than normal. In addition, some cars use four(cid:1)wheel drive for better
grip, fact which results in higher fuel consumption [213].

P4.1.2. Ambient temperature

PAmbient temperature can influence all kinds of external resistan-
ces on the vehicle. Low ambient temperature results in increased air
density and higher aerodynamic resistance [103], while increased
air temperature decreases aerodynamic resistance [214]. The tyre
condition is also affected by the increased temperature, as the con-
tained air pressure, the stiffness and the hysteresis of the rubber all
change, resulting in lower rolling resistance [189,215]. Temperature
can also have a more significant impact on the fuel consumption of
hybrid electric vehicles under real-world driving conditions because
battery capacity is reduced with lower temperatures [216].

P4.1.3. Cold-start

PAmbient temperature determines the temperature of the vehicle
and its components when starting after prolonged parking periods,
resulting in increased fuel consumption during the their warm up
phase (cold start effect). Cold start occurs when the vehicle starts
operating and lasts until all vehicle components reach their nominal
operating temperature for the first time (warm up phase). Cold start
is known to influence fuel consumption particularly in the case of
short distance trips [213,217]. Lubrication systems and their compo-
nents [218], tyres [188,189], vehicle transmission, engine and
exhaust after-treatment system [201,219] operate differently at
starting conditions and during the warm up phase of the trip, leading
to increased fuel consumption. The effect of cold start depends on
the initial temperature of the various components and the duration
of their warm up phase. The latter is not the same for all components
with exhaust after-treatments system usually reaching operating
temperature within 200 s regardless of the operating conditions,
while components such as the gearbox stabilize thermally after
more than 15(cid:1)20 km, depending on the operating conditions
[220(cid:1)223]. The cold start effect of each individual component on
fuel consumption disappears after its warm up phase. Predicting the
full impact of ambient temperature at cold start conditions on a
vehicle's fuel consumption is not straightforward.

PThe type approval test foresees a starting temperature of
20(cid:1)30 °C, with most tests performed at 25 °C, although according to
[224] starting a vehicle at 25 °C is not representative of average real-
world operation. A temperature in the range of 14 § 4 °C is consid-
ered more representative of the European average ambient tempera-
ture in autumn and spring [224]. Starting temperatures lower than
20 °C instead of 25 °C can result in a 6% increase in fuel consumption
due to excess cold start consumption [201]. Even within the foreseen
temperature range, measured fuel consumption can vary by more
than 2% [18,225], while [214] reports an increase of 2(cid:1)3% in fuel
consumption per 10 °C decrease in air
temperature. Finally,
despite that type approval foresees emissions tests also at very
low temperatures (¡7 °C), which are not uncommon in northern

P8000 km and increase vehicle fuel consumption by 30% compared to
its operation with wheels fully aligned [195]. Only a few studies
quantify this effect. However, there are several studies for heavy-
duty vehicles, where the impact seems to be greater [193,196].

PClogged air filters were found to increase fuel consumption in old
carburetted cars by 2 to 6% [126], but there was no information on
similar effects occurring on modern fuel injection spark ignition
cars. It is assumed that the effect is much lower as fuel injection in
modern cars is adapted to ensure a correct mixture. One report [16]
states that fuel consumption can increase by 6% due to filter clog-
ging. This case, for old carburetted cars, is also verified by the U.S.

and presented on their fuel economy website. Tests [197] on two
turbocharged vehicles with clean and clogged air filters resulted in
no significant change in fuel economy or CO2 emissions. According
to [198] for compression ignition engine vehicles the greatest
effect of a clogged air filter is a decrease in maximum power and
acceleration.

4. Environmental and traffic conditions

4.1. Weather conditions

PWeather conditions refer to all factors associated to meteorologi-
cal phenomena that can have a direct or indirect influence on vehicle
fuel consumption. The current vehicle certification test is performed
at fixed temperature, pressure and humidity; such conditions do not
reflect weather variations that a driver experiences throughout the
year. Three categories D
Xappear to have the largest impact on the fuel
consumption and CO2 emissions of passenger cars: wind, tempera-
ture and altitude (ambient pressure) [211]. Weather conditions such
as rain, snow or fog can also impact fuel consumption by affecting
the way the vehicle is driven and by influencing resistance, the oper-
ation of auxiliary units or the engine. Ambient conditions are not sta-
ble and may vary depending on geographical location, weather
pattern, and yearly seasons.

vehicle as they change the characteristics of the road surface. Rain

PEuropean countries, CO2 and fuel consumption are not reported in
this case. According to [226] the fuel consumption of Euro 4 petrol
and diesel cars was measured to be 78% lower at 23 °C (0.04 l) com-
pared to ¡20 °C (0.18 l) and 69% lower compared to ¡7 °C (0.13 l).

PThe cold start effect may have a different impact on vehicle fuel
consumption depending on powertrain technology. Vehicles tested
[227] over NEDC under temperatures of 25 °C and ¡7 °C showed
increases in fuel consumption of 21% for a multiport injection (MPI)
spark ignition vehicle and 16% for a direct injection spark ignition
vehicle (DISI). An American study [221] on the effect of the cold start
in the urban cycle found an increase of 15% and 20% for conventional
vehicles and a 20% to 37% for hybrids at temperatures of ¡6.7 °C
compared to warm operation. In the same study, the difference
between cold start at 22 °C and warm operation was between 6%
and 12%. Measurements in Europe over the NEDC [217] on 8 petrol
and 5 diesel cars at temperatures of 22 °C and ¡7 °C showed an
increase a 15% increase in fuel consumption for the gasoline vehicles
and 20% for the diesel. Finally, the effect of cold start on the starting
temperature is more pronounced in hybrid electric vehicles. A Cana-
dian study [228] tested a conventional petrol vehicle and three
hybrids at temperatures of ¡8 °C and 20 °C. The increase in fuel con-
sumption for the hybrids varied from 56% to 107% for the city cycle
and from 31% to 77% in the unified cycle, while the discrepancy for
the conventional car was lower at 23% and 19% respectively.

PFig. 4.1 presents a summary of the values found in literature link-
ing cold start temperature to excess fuel consumption over certifica-
tion cycles. Literature data are combined with the results of an
analysis undertaken by the EC's Joint Research Centre (JRC) [229]
that was based on internal vehicle measurements following the
NEDC at various temperatures [217,230].

PIn real-world driving conditions the effect of cold start on fuel con-
sumption depends on the distance travelled, the duration of the trip
and the number of sub-trips. Short distance trips exhibit higher fuel
consumption compared to medium or longer distance due to high
energy losses of non-thermally stabilised components [120,231]. For a
trip with characteristics similar to those of NEDC (11 km, 20 min,
20(cid:1)25 °C, 33 km/h) fuel consumption increases by 10% due to cold
start (Fig. 4.1). This increase is higher for shorter distance trips and
lower average speed values. An increased frequency of short urban
trips where vehicle components are partly or fully cooled down can

Presult in additional fuel consumption compared to the officially
reported value. According to [205], performing many short trips under
urban conditions instead of a single long trip amplifies the effect of
cold start and may lead to high fuel consumption up as much as 30 l/
100 km. However, allowing the car to idle in order to warm up and
reduce the cold start effect does not save fuel [120,231].

PAdvanced thermal management systems can accelerate the
warm up phase for the engine and gearbox and limit the effect of
cold start on fuel consumption These systems incorporate separate
cooling circuits for engine block and cylinder head, cooling systems
with switchable components (e.g. the coolant pump, cooled exhaust
manifolds), exhaust gas heat recovery (e.g. Rankine cycle and ther-
moelectric generator) and other technologies that control the vehi-
cle's cooling system. Fig. 4.2 presents the effect of such systems.
Advanced thermal management can have a benefit over the vehicle
certification test cycle and real-world conditions but it is not possi-
ble to quantify the contribution of such systems to the gap between
official and real fuel consumption. In the case of hybrid vehicles,
heat storage systems ensure that the cooling down of the powertrain
system during low load or fully electric operation mode does not
exceed certain boundaries [232].

P4.1.3.1. Eco-innovations related to cold start.
PTwo groups of technolo-
gies that relate to cold start have received the Eco-innovation status:
engine encapsulation and enthalpy storage tanks. Engine encapsula-
tion is a technology that reduces the cold start effect by reducing the
cooling of the powertrain system during the stop time [233]. The
system reduces the heat loss by slowing the cool-down of the engine
when it is turned off. This technology can have important savings in
urban driving where a large number of non-consecutive trips take
place.

PWith regard to the enthalpy storage tank, heat from the coolant is
stored into a thermally insulated tank when the vehicle is turned off
[234]. Upon restarting the engine, the hot coolant is circulating in
order to heat the engine compartments, therefore reducing the cold
start effect. The average CO2 emissions benefits of these two technol-
ogies considering various parking times at a 14 °C ambient tempera-
ture (the average European temperature) are expected to be about
1(cid:1)4 gCO2/km depending on the vehicle type, size and technology.

P4.1.4. Wind conditions

PAmbient winds are almost always present and affect the aerody-
namic performance of vehicles when driving at higher speeds. Wind

Pdirection tends to change during on-road driving due to weather
conditions, the varying landscape or vehicle turning. Wind perpen-
dicular to the car's motion is called crosswind and apart from pre-
vailing ambient winds it can be caused by another passing vehicle
and result in an asymmetric flow around the vehicle affecting drag,
lift and pitching moment that can cause instability [235]. When the
vehicle turns, or when the velocity is reduced, the angle between
the direction of the apparent wind and that of the vehicle speed
(yaw angle) changes and the car exposes a larger area to the wind
than its actual frontal area. Depending on the conditions this may
lead to increases in aerodynamic resistance. In real-world conditions
wind is affected by roadside objects and other vehicles that cause a
non(cid:1)uniform airflow and turbulence, conditions that deviate from
the ideal ones found in the laboratory or during the coast down test
[236]. Despite the effect of crosswinds, yaw angle and speed, the
majority of published studies examine aerodynamics at zero yaw
angle wind conditions [237].

PWind tunnel tests for yaw angles from 0° to 40° found that the
aerodynamic coefficient obtains the maximum value at a 35° yaw
angle [238] having a significant impact on large square shaped
vehicles such as sports utility vehicles (SUVs) or trucks. A study
[235] focusing on the impact of crosswind angle and velocity on the
air drag coefficient showed a decrease in drag coefficient from
0.55 to 0.45 when yaw angle changed from 0° to 15° respectively.
However, drag coefficient increased at higher yaw angles reaching
0.60(cid:1)0.65 at 90° for crosswind speeds of 80(cid:1)120 km/h respectively
(9(cid:1)18% increase compared to 0°).

PThe effect of crosswind under different yaw conditions on car
aerodynamics was investigated by Landstr€om et al. [237] taking into
consideration the effects of the rotating wheels and air inlets.
Fig. 4.3 presents the difference in the drag coefficient for various
yaw angle values for four car configurations. There is a significant
increase in drag in yaw angles between 8° and 18°.

PAdditionally, wind velocity is important as for example a velocity
of 3 m/s can influence air drag, either positively or negatively, by up
to 10% [116] that in turn translates in a 2% average CO2 emissions
increase [89,101]. Wind conditions can therefore have a measurable
impact on in-use fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, increasing
the gap between reported values and the consumption experienced
by the drivers.

Fig. 4.3. Difference in aerodynamic coefficient for various yaw angle values (adapted
from [237]).

4.2. Altitude

PAn increase in altitude is reported to decrease fuel consumption
[18] as lower atmospheric pressure leads to reduced air density and
lower air drag [81,239]. At 1000 m above sea level the density of air
is approximately 10% lower compared to that foreseen for the official
testing of vehicle road loads (air drag) and fuel consumption. The
resulting decrease in air drag can lead to a 2(cid:1)3% reduction in fuel
consumption reduction.

PLower air density can also influence fuel consumption by affect-
ing engine operation when the air/fuel mixture in the engine is con-
trolled by means of throttling. Due to the lower oxygen content of
air, a wider throttle opening is necessary for charging the engine in
order to achieve the same power output, fact which in turn may
result in lower pumping losses and lower fuel consumption. Operat-
ing at high altitude has been found to result in a 3.5% decrease in
fuel consumption compared to the NEDC measurement and 2.6%
decreased compared to the FTP cycle [240]. Decreases in the same
order of magnitude (4(cid:1)5%) have been also reported for test tracks
located at high altitude and in warm climates [18]. Paradoxically, an
increase in fuel consumption of 6.2% was found [240] in highway
driving conditions. A possible explanation of this observation at high
speed/load conditions could be that the vehicle operated close to full
load conditions. In such cases the reduction in engine power output
due to the engine's lower volumetric efficiency may result in fuel
enrichment introduced to compensate the power deficit and [241]
notes that such enrichments would increase fuel consumption in the
case of naturally aspirated engines. A study [239] on naturally aspi-
rated engines investigated the effect of altitude on fuel consumption
and exhaust emissions over a cruising driving cycle and the NEDC.
The authors found an increase in fuel consumption that accounts for
0.2 l/100 km per 1000 m of altitude increase for both cycles.

4.3. Road

PWith the term “road” we refer to the road characteristics such as
morphology, road surface and road shape. All of them can impact
real-world CO2 emissions but none of them is currently reflected in
vehicle certification tests. Road morphology refers to the geomor-
phological characteristics of the road. The characteristics that have
an effect on fuel consumption are altitude, road shape, road surface
and grade. The structural condition of the road surface is described
by the roughness and the texture while construction materials used
for the road surface include asphalt and cement.

P4.3.1. Road grade

PA car that is driven uphill requires more power to overcome grav-
ity than one that is on a flat road while a car that is going downhill
requires less. Road grade has an important effect on vehicle CO2
emissions. Researchers [242] performed measurements and simula-
tions on a passenger car, investigating the effect of grade on CO2 and
testing the CO2 emissions sensitivity over a fixed route. They identi-
fied increases in CO2 emissions of up to 2% for grades of 0.25% and
5% for grades of the order of 1%. In the case of negative slope the
reductions in fuel consumption reported were approximately ¡1%
and ¡3.5% for grades of ¡0.25% and ¡1% respectively. The study
notes that in order to estimate vehicle CO2 exhaust emissions at a
micro-scale in real-world conditions, a representative road grade
profile for each second of the test data is needed and concludes that
transport management and urban planning projects should be incor-
porating road grade into their analysis where prediction of real-
world vehicle CO2 emissions and fuel consumption is required. As
reported by Park and Rakha [243] a 1.5% increase in roadway grade
increases fuel consumption by 9%. Measurements [244] of passenger
car fuel consumption over two different routes leading to the same
destination, with one route being flat while the other one containing

Puphill and downhill sections, showed increases of 15(cid:1)20% for
the hilly route. The fact that the additional fuel consumed when
travelling uphill is not fully compensated by the fuel savings when
travelling downhill contributes to the fuel consumption gap. This
hysteresis in fuel consumption due to road grade should be taken
into consideration when comparing real-world fuel consumption
with official data.

P4.3.2. Road roughness and texture

PThe roughness of the road is the vertical deviation of the intended
longitudinal profile of the surface [245] and is measured by means of
the International Roughness Index (IRI). The IRI is based on the aver-
age rectified slope (ARS), a filtered ratio of a standard vehicle's
accumulated suspension motion (in mm, inches, etc.) divided by the
distance travelled by the vehicle during the measurement (km, mi,
etc.) [246]. Roughness depends on the construction and the condi-
tion of the road and is used as an indicator for maintenance. A typical
range of IRI values is 2(cid:1)16 mm/m, with 2 being high quality surface
similar to that of airport runways and superhighways while values
of 12 mm/m and above correspond to eroded surfaces with deep
depressions. An IRI value between 3 and 7 mm/m can be considered
as typical for most European roads. Rough roads limit maximum
speed, while causing discomfort to the passengers [247,248]. Fuel
consumption increases by up to 3% for an average light commercial
vehicle and by 4% for a medium sized passenger car for an IRI value
of 5 mm/m compared to a reference IRI D 2 mm/m surface [248].
The roughness of roads deteriorates with time leading to increases
in fuel consumption of vehicles.

PTexture is the deviation from a planar surface and plays a part in
road surface friction resistance and assists in the braking of vehicles
[249]. While vehicle suspension deflection and dynamic tire loads
are affected by longer wavelength (roughness), road texture affects
the interaction between the road surface and the tyre footprint.
Road texture is defined based on its wavelength and its effect varies
accordingly with its size. As a means of quantification in a single
value the root mean square (RMS) of texture depth is used [250].
The smaller the wavelength the more beneficial its effects such
as better friction, lower rolling resistance and noise reduction. The
texture RMS is linearly linked to the rolling resistance coefficient
with pavements of higher RMS exhibiting higher rolling resistance
coefficients and fuel consumption [251]. High RMS values can
increase rolling resistance by 5 to 10% [252], while changes in tex-
ture could result in a 5(cid:1)10% increase in fuel consumption [188].

PRoad construction materials define road texture and roughness.
Cement pavements tend to exhibit high roughness and texture com-
pared to asphalt pavements [188]. In Sweden fuel consumption
increases by 0.8% on cement roads compared to asphalt roads at a

Pspeed of 50 km/h. This difference increases to 3.3% at a speed of
70 km/h. In the Netherlands a speed of 90 km/h increases fuel con-
sumption by 2.7% on concrete roads. In the US urban driving speeds
of less than 50 km/h fuel consumption is 4% higher by on asphalt
than on concrete roads [253].

4.4. Traffic conditions and congestion

PTraffic refers to the number of vehicles that are moving on a road
at a given time. Increased traffic will affect the speed profile of the
vehicles during a trip but may also influence the behaviour of
the drivers. Increased traffic in most occasions leads to increases
in the vehicles’ fuel consumption [254] that may be severe under
low speed urban driving conditions and in heavy traffic [255]. The
urban part of NEDC represents relatively intense traffic conditions
[136,256,257] exhibiting an average speed of 18 km/h.

PIncreased traffic affects fuel consumption in several ways. It
reduces the average and maximum speed of the trip, it increases
transient operation (accelerations-decelerations) and can result in
congested conditions that are characterized by low vehicle speeds,
vehicle standstills and increased engine idling [254,258,259,261].
The impact of traffic on vehicle fuel consumption is not uniform
and depends on the characteristics of the vehicle fleet and the geo-
graphical area where the vehicle is driven [200(cid:1)202].

PIn the case of Europe, a typical example of the effect of average
speed/traffic conditions on CO2 emissions and fuel consumption
[262] can be found in Fig. 4.4. The continuous lines demonstrate the
predictions of two widely used European emission inventory tools
(COPERT and HBEFA) [263,264] while the dots and the correspond-
ing error bars demonstrate the average experimental results and
their standard deviation respectively. The experimental results
which were obtained from tests on various Euro 5 vehicles over dif-
ferent driving cycles (NEDC, Artemis, and WMTC) confirm the capac-
ity of such tools to capture the effect of different traffic conditions
on CO2 emissions. Trips with low average speed (<30 km/h) exhibit
the highest CO2 emissions and the highest divergence from the
NEDC result which, at 18 km/h, reaches on average 40% for the diesel
and 60% for the petrol cars. The optimal trip speed in terms of CO2
are in the range of 60 to 80 km/h where emissions tend to be 15%
and 23% lower compared to the NEDC ones for diesel and petrol
vehicles respectively. The trend is reversed above 80(cid:1)90 km/h and
the gap is widened as speed increases. The situation is different
for hybrid vehicles where the contribution of the electrical system,
during urban driving conditions, offers significant fuel consumption
reductions [265].

PIt is reported that in high speed driving increased traffic may
lead to reduced fuel consumption as drivers are forced to maintain

Plower speeds and to adapt their driving to the trajectory of the
leader vehicle [266].

PHeavy traffic can result in congestion and alter operating con-
ditions on a given road. Congestion is the deterioration of smooth,
free-flowing traffic conditions due to increased travel demand
and/or reduced traffic movement capacity [267]. Congestion is in
general considered to be the traffic condition leading to the high-
est fuel consumption and can result in a 40% higher fuel consump-
tion compared to driving the same trip in uncongested conditions
[268]. A US study [269] estimated that the fraction of fuel wasted
due to traffic congestion will reach 2.6% of the overall fuel con-
sumption by 2020. Another study [266] compared CO2 emissions
from cars operating at steady state conditions to the emissions
during real-world driving conditions and found an increase of 40%
at 45 km/h due to congestion. The average increase in fuel con-
sumption for congested roads calculated from all the examined
cases is about 26%. Fig. 4.5 shows the effect of congestion on fuel
consumption for various route types.

PVehicle standstill in congested roads leads to prolonged idling
times, which in turn has a fuel consumption penalty. Vehicle
idling applies if the vehicle does not feature any engine start and
stop system [270,18] as start stop systems are designed to switch
off the engine at vehicle standstill. In the EU an estimated 43% of
new gasoline vehicles and 55% of new diesel vehicles (2013) [271]
are equipped with start stop systems. The suppression of idling
during the vehicle certification test and in real-world driving can
reduce fuel consumption [272] by up to 8% for a small size and
9.5% for an average sized vehicle [273]. The latter values are con-
sidered relatively high for modern European passenger cars, not
equipped with start stop systems, tested over NEDC where the
contribution of idling in the total CO2 emissions is about 2(cid:1)3% for
manual transmission vehicles and 4(cid:1)5% for automatic transmis-
sion vehicles.

PFinally, congestion can lead to fuel consumption increases by
affecting how the drivers actually drive as it can cause delays and
increases drivers’ stress [274]. In an effort to compensate for such
delays, drivers may adopt a more aggressive driving style compared
to how they would normally drive for the rest of their trip. However,
optimizing driving behaviour is considered important to improve
the overall energy consumption [275] with the eco-driving concept
being discussed as early as 1986 [276].

5. Driver and user related factors

5.1. Driving

PThe way the vehicle is driven has a substantial impact in fuel con-
sumption. The term more frequently used to characterize the way a
vehicle is being driven is driving behaviour. Driving behaviour refers
to the personal driving style of a driver and is characterized by
instantaneous and average speed, acceleration and choice of gears
[280]. Driving behaviour may depend on the personal character, age
and gender of the driver [126,280], as well as on external factors
such as roads, journey type, weather and traffic conditions [281].
Aggressive driving is known to increase fuel consumption and CO2
emissions [126,137,281], while driver training leads to decreased
fuel consumption [16,282,283].

P5.1.1. Aggressive driving

PAggressive driving, in some cases referred to also as “dynamic
driving”, is characterized by high accelerations and decelerations,
high maximum vehicle speeds and high engine operating RPMs that
lead to increased fuel consumption [281,126,86]. It is difficult to
define an average driving behaviour to be used as a European refer-
ence. The maximum speed is the factor with the highest influence
on fuel consumption [284]. In a dataset of over 500,000 vehicles,
where users register online their fuel consumption between fuelling
events and provide also information about their driving style, users
who declared a “speedy” style have on average 7% higher fuel con-
sumption compared to those declaring a balanced driving [19]. How-
ever, it should be noted that when testing vehicles in real-world
driving conditions, it is difficult to distinguish the effect of traffic
conditions from that of aggressive driving [285]. Fig. 5.1 summarizes
the values collected regarding the effect of aggressive driving on
fuel consumption.

PConsidering the average value of the results presented in Fig. 5.1,
it has been estimated that fuel consumption for aggressive driving
can increase by 25%. Increases are substantially more pronounced in
urban driving conditions. This observation is attributed to the

Fig. 4.5. Effect of congestion on fuel consumption compared to free flow traffic by
route type. The references cited in this figure are [254,266,268].

Pinfluence of idle consumption, the frequent start and stops and the
frequent accelerations in urban conditions. The tests on the highway
resulted in lower increases because of the minimal idling and accel-
erations and high average speed. The identified difference between
EU and US could be traced back to the fact that cars in the US exhibit
higher fuel consumption compared to their European counterparts.
This means that the baseline fuel consumption is already higher in
the US (see also Table 2.2) so the relative fuel penalty introduced by
aggressive driving is lower [218].

P5.1.2. Driving mode

PSome cars offer built-in driving modes for achieving more
dynamic performance or reduced fuel consumption. These modes
can adjust engine tuning, gear shifting in the case of automatic gear-
boxes, perform suspension adjustment and engage four-wheel drive
when necessary.

PAn internet search of manufacturers’ websites for information
about these technologies revealed three general types of modes:
(a) Eco, for reducing fuel consumption; (b) Normal, which is the
baseline operation of the car; and (c) Sport, for better performance
in terms of vehicle responsiveness and power output, which is
expected to be the most fuel consuming mode.

PCertain modes [286] claim to offer a 20% improvement in fuel
consumption by using pedal and gear recognition, brake energy
recuperation, optimizing shifting and A/C temperature control,
while providing additional information for more efficient driving to
the driver. The same manufacturer offers a “Sport” mode option,
where the car is adjusted to a more dynamic style, while the engine
is more responsive and the suspension is stiffer, but no figure for the
fuel consumption penalty associated with this mode was found
[287]. Similarly, Toyota [288] claims that the “Sport” mode option
leads to faster acceleration by increasing throttle response, higher
gear shifting, more performance (cid:1) oriented RPM and adjusted elec-
tric power steering assist for a sportier feeling. However, the CO2 or
fuel consumption penalty was not reported. According to VW [289],
the “Eco” mode leads to more environmental friendly driving with
less emissions and lower fuel consumption by optimizing engine,
gearbox and A/C performance. The decrease is not specified by the
manufacturer and the expected CO2 penalties for the sport mode,
which results in faster accelerations and better steering response,
are not provided. Certain non-OEM affiliated sources [290] claim to
have observed a 11% increase in fuel consumption for the “sport”
mode without providing detailed information on how such numbers
are produced. Finally, some hybrid electric cars offer the option to
use the vehicle in an all-electric mode (EV). Manufacturers encour-
age the use of this mode for a short distance at low speeds, in traffic,
in closed spaces such as garages and to decrease noise late at night
[291,292]. It was not possible to find an extensive scientific study
regarding driving modes, as there is no common definition for the
terms and every manufacturer uses its own settings.

P5.1.3. Eco(cid:1)driving

PDrivers can be trained in practices that reduce fuel consumption,
pollutant emissions [293] and result in safer driving. Fuel efficient
driving consists of earlier gear shifting for achieving lower engine
RPMs, maintaining steady vehicle speeds, anticipation of traffic
movement, smooth deceleration and stopping [16,219]. The web-
site of the Natural Resources of the Government of Canada [294]
shows five fuel efficient driving techniques compared to an average
driving style, without quantifying their benefit. These techniques
include gentle accelerations, coast down decelerations, maintaining
a steady speed and avoidance of high speeds, which in essence sum-
marize the main principles of Eco-driving.

PA study investigated the effect of four speed patterns on fuel con-
sumption in three vehicles for a fixed distance on a chassis dyna-
mometer [295]. Eco-driving conditions comprised smooth changes

Pin velocity and maintaining constant speed. The study found an
11.7% decrease in fuel consumption compared to average driving.
It was also found that the installation of certain accessories on
the vehicle, such as the gear shift indicator or fuel consumption
indicators, which directly or indirectly instruct the driver how to
drive in a more efficient manner, have a quantifiable effect in
decreasing fuel consumption [265,18]. Of course this does not guar-
antee that all drivers follow the suggested gear shifting in real-world
driving conditions. The use of gear shifting indicators was tested
during the NEDC and it was found that the most prominent improve-
ment was in the urban phase, while the gains in the extra-urban
phase were negligible [296]. However, higher CO2 savings were
achieved in the cold start accounting for a 4.3% reduction compared
to the baseline, while in the warm start the reductions were
estimated to be 3.6%.

PFig. 5.2 summaries the effectiveness of eco-driving strategies. The
simplest strategy presented here is optimal gear shifting, while fur-
ther training consists of more elements such as smooth accelerations
and decelerations, braking and traffic anticipation. A study [297]
suggests that improved navigation systems and intelligent use of
navigation data is expected to improve the efficiency of eco-driving
strategies. The authors of [19] have conducted a statistical analysis
on data provided by individual drivers who declared their fuel
consumption and driving style voluntarily. Although eco-driving
technique was not specified in the data collection form, drivers
who characterized their style as economical resulted in 9% lower
fuel consumption compared to the ones who declared normal
driving style.

P5.1.4. Four-wheel drive

PMany cars are sold with a switchable two-wheel (2WD) and four-
wheel (4WD) drive mode. It is not obligatory to test such vehicles
during certification in 4WD mode and the common practice is to
perform the vehicle certification test in two-wheel mode [158]. Lab-
oratory measurements [298] on a chassis dyno over a low speed
driving cycle in 2WD and 4WD modes revealed 1.5% savings in fuel
economy for the 2WD mode. Engaging four-wheel traction in real-
world driving conditions increases the power losses in a vehicle's
driveline leading to an increase in fuel consumption. A four wheel
drive vehicle in real-world operation can have an increased fuel con-
sumption of 0.5 l/100 km [141]. No scientific references were found
with regard to the extent to which drivers use the 4WD mode in
real-world driving conditions.

P5.1.5. ADAS

PSeveral new vehicles are equipped with Advanced Driver Aid Sys-
tems (ADAS) that deploy a series of sophisticated sensors such as
rear view cameras and radars to provide additional information to
the driver and the vehicle [299]. These systems are marketed as fuel
saving technologies [300], offering advice to the driver on optimal
practices or in some cases by acting independently of the driver on
the vehicle's operation and controls [301]. The deployment of such
systems does not aim only to reduce fuel consumption, but also to
increase road safety by providing warnings such as possible colli-
sions with other vehicles and by detecting pedestrians and traffic
signs [302,303]. In addition, integrated communication systems uti-
lize data collected by ADAS that is shared with other vehicles and
infrastructure and inform other drivers on the traffic conditions
[303]. The EC funded ICT-emissions project investigated vehicle and
infrastructure information exchange in order to optimize traffic flow
[304]. The study showed that information exchange can lead to
reductions in CO2 emissions exceeding 15% in urban driving for a
combination of ADAS, stop-start systems and eco-driving patterns
[305]. An ACEA backed study investigated the effect of ADAS on fuel
consumption by deploying dynamic navigation tools to reduce trip
fuel consumption and driving recognition patterns that provide

Pfeedback to the driver. The study found a 5(cid:1)20% improvement in
fuel consumption compared to average driving [306].

P5.1.5.1. Eco-innovations related to ADAS systems.
PTwo groups of tech-
nology, which can be considered as ADAS systems, have been
granted eco-innovation status: predictive energy management and
coasting. Predictive energy management is a technology that focuses
on hybrid vehicles [307]. The technology receives geospatial data
from the navigation system of the vehicle and adapts energy usage
strategy and recuperation by predicting upcoming changes to the
slope of the route. The expected CO2 reduction benefits of this tech-
nology are approximately 1(cid:1)3 gCO2/km.

PCoasting technology [308] utilizes an automatic gearbox that dis-
engages the engine from the wheels to permit the vehicle to coast
when engine idling leads to fuel savings compared to engine braking
mode. The engine is idling and continues to provide power to the
auxiliary equipment. The expected CO2 reduction benefits are about
1(cid:1)5 gCO2/km.

5.2. Open windows

POpen windows affect the normal flow of the air around the vehi-
cle influencing its aerodynamic resistance. The range and magnitude
of this influence depends on the vehicle's shape, the average speed
and how much and which windows are open. The data collected on
the issue were scarce and insufficient for drawing a solid conclusion.
The main source found was a study [122] for US vehicles quantifying
the effect of open windows on CO2 emissions. The study presents
the results of measurements on two vehicles over 64 to 129 km/h
with an 8 km/h interval. A sedan and an SUV vehicle were tested
with all windows closed and open. In the case of the sedan in a speed
range between 65 and 130 km/h, open windows resulted in an
increase in CO2 emissions of 5.6 to 8.3%. The influence of open win-
dows was less prominent in the case of the SUV, leading to increases
between 0.3 to 2.3%. The increased in aerodynamic resistance caused
by the opening of windows is low in the case of the SUV compared to
the resistance of the aerodynamically optimized sedan vehicle.

POpening the windows could be viewed as a more fuel efficient
practice for reducing the temperature in the car's cabin compared to
the use of air-conditioning. Limited information is available as to

Pwhich of the two is the best in terms of fuel saving and up to what
speed. OEAMTC [144] claims that for speeds up to 90 km/h the
impact of open windows on fuel consumption is lower than the use
of A/C. Auto Alliance [309] in their Eco-driver's manual suggests that
windows should be left open up to the speed of 65 km/h.

5.3. Occupancy rates

POccupancy rate is defined as the number of passengers per vehi-
cle, including the driver, and it directly affects the weight of the cars
under real-world driving conditions operation and its fuel consump-
tion. The EEA [310] reported a decreasing trend in occupancy rates
from 1.75 in 1980 to 1.6 in 2003 for Denmark, the Netherlands and
the United Kingdom. The International Energy Agency (IEA) [180]
reported even lower figures, 1.37 for urban vehicle occupancy and
1.15 for commute vehicle occupancy in Europe. The EEA [311] states
that according to the last available data (pre 2008), the average num-
ber of passengers per car (including the driver) was approximately
1.45 passengers per vehicle for the selected countries (in the UK (cid:1)
1.58; Germany (cid:1) 1.42 and Netherlands (cid:1) 1.38). The possible reasons
for this decrease is the greater individualization of society, the
decline in household sizes and the increase in car ownership, but
they comment that the rate of decline has slowed in recent years.
EEA considers the trend to be representative of the whole EU.

PBased on the information collected, an occupancy rate of 1.5 pas-
senger/vehicle can be considered representative of the EU average
conditions. However, this value varies between countries and
depends on the driving conditions with long distance trips having
higher rates than short urban trips. Given the rate of decrease one
would expect even lower occupancy rates today. Nevertheless, since
2008 the promotion of car-pooling, the appearance of new car-shar-
ing services and the economic crisis may have further slowed down
this trend because commuters have more opportunities for sharing a
trip and have fewer resources to spend in order to drive their
vehicles individually. It was not possible verify this assumption nor
to retrieve more updated information regarding occupancy rates at
the European level. The EEA has decided to discontinue the reporting
of the occupancy rate indicator and archived the content as of 2015.
This lack of data is an issue that needs be addressed in future
research.

PAn occupancy rate of 1.5 passengers/vehicle corresponds to an
additional mass of about 40 kg, not accounted for during the vehicle
certification test. The average payload, excluding passengers, is esti-
mated to be 55 kg [65], adding up to a total 95 kg of average extra
load, that is not taken into consideration. This additional weight
could lead to a 5(cid:1)7% increase of in fuel consumption according to
the values (see Fig. 3.1). The reduction in vehicle occupancy limits
the gap between official and real-world fuel consumption because
the vehicle mass is closer to the one used in the official test [260].
However, a high occupancy rate is desirable in all transport modes
as it leads to lower emissions and consumption per passenger. Con-
sidering the inelastic nature of passenger transport demand,
increased occupancy rates can lead to CO2 savings. Assuming an
occupancy rate of 1.5 passengers per vehicle, the 2015 average CO2
emissions of 120.7 g/km would translate into approximately
80 gCO2/(passenger*km).
the equivalent values
In comparison,
for city buses are estimated to be in the range of 15(cid:1)30 gCO2/
(passenger*km) [312,313] depending on the operating conditions
and bus type.

5.4. Fuel choice

PAutomotive fuels are blends of various types of hydrocarbons and
other organic compounds, whose characteristics are regulated by
the relevant standards [49,314]. In the certification test, vehicles use
standardized fuels and their physical properties vary within a lim-
ited range. On the other hand, commercial fuel composition and
characteristics may vary within a wider range due to climatic condi-
tions, regional policy and market availability of blend-stocks.
The latter becomes more evident considering variations of bio-
components in commercial fuel. For example the ethanol and biodie-
sel contents in conventional petrol and diesel fuels respectively are
not uniform across EU [315]. In several countries different biofuel
blends are available in the market in addition to standard fuel e.g.
10% or 85% Ethanol (cid:1) Gasoline blends (E10, E85).

PChoosing a fuel with high biofuel concentration is beneficial con-
sidering the overall GHG emissions over its lifecycle but can have a
noticeable effect on fuel consumption and to a lesser extent on tail-
pipe CO2 emissions. Using straight biodiesel is reported to increase
fuel consumption by 9% [316] due to biodiesel's lower energy den-
sity. Biodiesel's effect on tailpipe emissions is limited leading to
lower increases of about 2 § 1% [317] as a result of the lower carbon
content of the biofuel. Using E10 fuel increases the fuel consumption
by 3.5(cid:1)4% and marginally reduces tailpipe CO2 [230,318,319] while
E85 may increase fuel consumption by 30(cid:1)35% while reducing tail-
pipe CO2 by 5(cid:1)7% [230].

PFinally, climatic conditions require variations in fuel properties,
in particular for diesel fuels, related to volatility, viscosity, formation
of wax crystals and freezing point. The creation of crystals can lead
to irregular fuel flow, filter clogging, loss of power, engine stall
after start, or engine failure [320]. In order to prevent these effects,
permissible diesel characteristics are adjusted each season [321],
depending on country and climate. No data were found on the effect
of seasonal fuel variation on fuel consumption, which will essentially
depend on the fuel's energy content variation.

6. Vehicle certification test

PA divergence between certification and in-use values can be
expected due to the vehicle certification test's boundary conditions
and other related factors related to the inherent inability to capture
all possible operating conditions in a laboratory based test, particu-
larly if this is a single driving cycle test. It is impossible for any kind
of standard and lab-based test to cover all possible conditions
of real-world driving. Nonetheless, it is important to point out
the significance of various elasticities associated with any official

Plaboratory test as they make reproduction of the results difficult for
individual researchers. In addition, it is important that any test pro-
cedure retains a stable offset, or gap, compared to reality, at least on
a statistical basis. Divergences appear to increase over time as dis-
cussed previously and can be linked mainly to two factors:

Pi. Vehicle technologies or vehicle use do not display same CO2
effect in the laboratory and in real-world driving conditions,
therefore requiring test procedures to be revised and updated;
Pii. Vehicle manufacturers have learnt to exploit the margins of flex-

ibility allowed by any test procedure.

PThe second element is important as it can be used by vehicle
manufacturers at zero cost and can disrupt market competition.
Manufacturers who exploit the test margins obtain an unfair com-
petitive advantage compared to those who achieve the same fuel
consumption by implementing costly technologies. As a conse-
quence, when the vehicle certification test is undertaken by an inde-
pendent body, significant deviations (beyond the natural test-to-test
variability) between the test result and the official certification value
arise.

PA series of laboratory tests [328] conducted on petrol and diesel
vehicles under the European type approval test procedure (NEDC
test) showed a discrepancy of 15 § 10% between laboratory meas-
urements and type approval values. This difference is attributed to
the preparation of the vehicle in terms of, for example, tyre pressure
and state of battery charge and to the chassis dynamometer settings.
Within the same project, the vehicles were driven on PEMS test
routes and a deviation of 18 § 10% for petrol vehicles and 24 § 7%
for diesel was reported. (see Fig. 6.1). Recent tests [29] carried out
on behalf of the French ministry of transport have shown in some
cases even higher deviations. Vehicles tested in an ex-post reproduc-
tion of the certification test were found to emit on average 15% more
CO2 than the certification value (with some vehicles emitting up to
50% more CO2). The deviation represents a clear indication that the
current European type-approval system, at least for what concerns
the certification of fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, has signifi-
cant flaws that are being exploited in a way that the improvements
in fuel consumption appear only during the vehicle certification pro-
cedure and have very little or no relevance in real driving conditions.
In the following section, an overview of the main test flexibilities in
the NEDC test procedure is reported.

tory test for petrol and diesel vehicles. Emissions target refers to 130 gCO2/km in

Real(cid:1)world road loads are 30% higher at high speeds compared to type approval;
Coast down tests performed with different wheels compared to the one actually
sold with the vehicle (lower rolling resistance, higher moment of inertia result
in artificially lower road loads and consequently CO2)

Setting the chassis-dynamometer to reproduce the vehicle road-loads requires
the vehicle to be warmed up to reproduce the conditions of the coast-down
tests. An NEDC cycle is foreseen for vehicle warm up, resulting in lower temper-
atures in the vehicle's driveline and hence higher internal losses compared to
those occurring during the actual coast down test. As a result, lower forces are
applied to the vehicle by the dyno to match the same road loads which in turn
lead to lower CO2 emissions by 1(cid:1)3 gCO2/km.

6.1. Test margins

PThe terms “margin”, "flexibility" or “elasticity” refer to a specific
provision or interpretation of the certification procedure or an
absence of such a provision or clear interpretation that, if applied,
results in the measurement of lower CO2 emission values. The com-
parative term “lower” assumes as a reference the values that would
occur if provisions, interpretations or practices more accurately
reflect real-world driving conditions within the boundaries and
technical
limitations of the applicable measurement procedure.
Although such flexibilities might not be “illegal” their intentional
and systematic exploitation in order to achieve benefits should be
considered to be against the spirit of the law.

PThe lack of binding prescriptions for certain elements of the test
procedure can be due to two main reasons: (i) to make the proce-
dure manageable in practical terms; and (ii) due to the lack of
knowledge on the effect of a particular flexibility. In both cases, the
problem arises for CO2 and fuel consumption certification if the mar-
gins can be legally exploited in order to deliver lower values. Many
European studies have been conducted on this issue. Table 6.1
presents a summary of the factors related to the test margins and
their effect. In addition, Fig. 6.2 presents the test elasticities (average
values per elasticity group) found in literature.

PRegarding the longitudinal vehicle dynamics resulting from the
speed profile of a single test cycle, researchers [55] argue that a set
of driving cycles should be used instead. Different vehicles, differing
in performance levels and usage characteristics, should be tested
under different conditions.

PThe reference mass, as introduced in the current type approval
process, equals the empty vehicle mass with an additional 100 kg to
account for the driver and fuel. The reference mass is considered by
definition lower than the operating mass as it does not take into
account the weight of additional passengers, equipment transported

Por variations of the vehicle mass caused by extra components and
accessories and different levels of equipment. The NEDC reference
mass is linked to specific tiers (inertia classes). Inertia classes define
the vehicle inertia that is simulated during the vehicle certification
test. Each tier represents a range in the vehicle reference mass. The

Pinertia used in each tier is the average mass of the tier. This led to a
non-continuous distribution of vehicle mass contrary to what hap-
pens in reality where mass is a continuous quantity. This has been
further exploited by vehicle manufacturers who have designed
their vehicles in order to have a reference mass always close to the
higher limit of the tier, and thus resulting in a vehicle inertia which
is systematically lower that the reference mass.

PAnother important element affecting directly tyre rolling resis-
tance during the test is tyre pressure. In NEDC there is no prescrip-
tion concerning the tyre pressure, the common practice is therefore
to inflate the tyre up to the maximum permissible pressure (»3 bar),
obtaining an advantage on the RRC. Keeping the pressure to the
maximum permissible pressure results in a small but measurable
benefit in CO2 emissions due to the reduction of the tyre's rolling
resistance characteristics and its contact surface with the chassis
dyno. In addition to the pressure, another element affecting the
vehicle rolling resistance is the tyre tread. In particular, the higher
the depth of the tyre tread, the higher the RRC [175]. During type-
approval tyre depth can be between 50 and 90%. Adopting the
minimum depth [48], CO2 emissions can be thus underestimated,
capturing only a fraction of the tyre's tread lifetime contribution to
emissions.

PThe present vehicle certification test is undertaken with the bat-
tery fully charged, as no indications on the state of charge of the
battery are reported in the legislation, something that does not cor-
respond to real-world driving conditions where battery status is
subject to a series of factors ranging from weather conditions to fre-
quency of vehicle use, traffic conditions and battery health. As vehi-
cle controllers are set to maintain a constant state of charge at
about 80(cid:1)90% of the battery's capacity, it is likely that all electrical
demands during the test are met through the discharge of the bat-
tery and no loads burden the alternator and the engine. In practical
terms, electric loads are excluded from the officially reported CO2
values [65].

PThe above constitute a summary of the main test flexibilities that
can be used to artificially reduce CO2 emissions during the certifica-
tion tests. Going into the details of all possible flexibilities is beyond
the scope of the present paper.

6.2. Vehicle certification testing in Japan and the United States

PThe majority of the vehicles sold in Europe (about 90%) are pro-
duced by European manufacturers [39], followed by manufacturers

Pbased in the USA and Japan and with a low portion of the sales from
South Korea [39]. The vehicle certification test in Japan and the
United States has been revised to provide realistic values. In Japan
the certification test was based on the 10(cid:1)15 mode that was a cycle
comprised of three segments accounting for urban driving (10
mode) and one segment for highway driving (15 mode) [334]. The
10(cid:1)15 mode was replaced by the JC08, which is a more stringent
procedure, that was phased in from 2008 to 2011 [335,336]. The
JC08 is considered to deliver realistic emission values [337] but it
has a lower average speed than the NEDC (22.7 km/h compared to
44.1 km/h of the NEDC, excluding stops) in order to compensate for
the lower speed limits in Japan, which are set at 100 km/h at the
express way [338], comparatively lower than the 120(cid:1)130 km/h
[339] set in Europe.

PThe US EPA utilizes a set of cycles that comprised of city
and highway cycles, with an average speed of 34.1 km/h and
77.7 km/h, respectively. After 2008 three supplementary tests
were included to address different driving conditions. The high-
speed supplementary test includes the US06 test cycle that has
an average speed of 77.9 km/h, but has higher top speed than
the highway speed cycle (128.7 km/h and 96.5 km/h, respec-
tively) and stronger accelerations (13.6 km/s2 and 5.1 km/s2,
respectively). The effect of the use of air-conditioning is mea-
sured over the SC03 test cycle at 35 °C with the A/C switched on.
Finally, the effect of low temperature on emissions is measured
with a city cycle at a laboratory temperature of ¡6.7 °C [72].
Emission standard compliance is measured under the city and
highway cycles that provide the unadjusted emission values,
but they do not take into consideration the driving conditions
previously mentioned. For this reason the values are adjusted
based on the supplementary tests and the adjusted fuel economy
is provided to the customers [340]. Fig. 6.3 presents the ratio
between on-road and official CO2 emissions. A divergence of
about 30% for the unadjusted values and close to zero for the
adjusted can be seen. Additionally, the data shows that while
there was a negative gap in the adjusted values there has been
a converging trend to zero in recent years [136]. In addition
to the certification procedure, the US EPA has a surveillance
programme and conducts tests on in-use vehicles to ensure
that they comply with emission standards and they do not devi-
ate from the laboratory measurements by a factor of 1.3 [15,73].
Violations can lead to significant fines for the vehicle manufac-
turer [10].

6.3. The WLTP introduction

PThe limitations in the NEDC procedure has resulted in the
demand for a new, more realistic and robust test procedure. As a
result, in 2009 the World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regu-
lations initiated action to develop a new harmonized procedure. In
2014 the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE)
adopted the first global technical regulation including the main
aspects of the new procedure [59]. The Worldwide Harmonized
Light Duty Test Procedure, WLTP, is the name of the procedure. In
2016 a new package was adopted to cover all the aspects of the vehi-
cle tests for fuel consumption, CO2 emissions and pollutant emis-
sions. The introduction of the new test procedure in the different
type-approval systems will depend on the specific country. The EU
will be the first to introduce it (by the end 2017) followed by Japan.
China, India, South Korea are expected to introduce it immediately
after. US will first assess the possible benefits before deciding
whether to adopt it or not.

PIn Europe the WLTP is expected to address many of the limita-
tions of the current type approval test and act as a valuable reference
basis for vehicle CO2 certification and monitoring. Table 6.2 presents
the main improvements of the WLTP with respect to the NEDC. The
changes are divided in four categories, namely: (i) road-load deter-
mination; (ii) laboratory test; (iii) processing test results; and (iv)
Certificate of Conformity (CoC).

PWith regards to (i) a series of changes take place. In WLTP for
example the definition of the mass has changed (to be more real-
istic by e.g. including the effect of optional equipment). In addi-
tion, the mass is allowed to vary in a continuous way (inertia
classes have been removed). A new more detailed protocol regard-
ing the calculation of resistance forces is introduced; tyre charac-
teristics are strictly defined as are the boundary conditions for
tyre pressure and pressure during the test. For example, the WLTP
prescribes that the type-approval test is carried out with the
tyre pressure set at the minimum of its range, resulting in an

Xbetween the test temperature (23 °C) D

Papproximate 0.3% increase in CO2 emissions [341]. D
XThe WLTP stan-
the minimum tyre tread depth is more stringent
dard for
X(cid:1)90%). In category (ii) the new
(80%(cid:1)100%) than under NEDC (50D
speed profile and gears shifting calculation algorithm are the main
changes whereas more strict definitions regarding the test tem-
perature boundaries and the vehicle preconditioning are intro-
duced. The world harmonized driving cycle (WLTC) is expected to
address the issue of a non-realistic speed profile or traffic condi-
tions. The WLTC cycle was produced from around 1 million km of
real-world vehicle activities and is subdivided in four different
phases reflecting traffic conditions at different average speeds
[59]. With regards to the processing of the final results, new con-
cepts are foreseen such as the correction of the fuel consumption
for the difference D
Xand the
average European temperature value of 14 °C and the correction
addressing the effect of battery depletion during the test (battery
State Of Charge correction). Finally, the current type approval
extension D
Xmechanism, resulting in up to 4% lower emissions com-
pared to the tested one, is abolished and a new definition of vehi-
cle families and how the certification can be extended to vehicles
of similar characteristics is introduced. Errors and flexibilities in
the test execution and road load determination have been also
corrected. This will contribute to achieving a more realistic certifi-
cation value. The impact of the introduction of WLTP on the aver-
age fleet-wide CO2 is estimated to be of the order of 15(cid:1)25%
[26,277,342,343],
increasing the average CO2 of new passenger
cars between 18 and 30 g/km (although any calculation has a
wide margin of uncertainty due to the fact that the new defini-
tions in the protocol regarding vehicle classification, road load
determination and type approval extension cannot be easily quan-
tified). WLTP in its first stage is lacking any correction for the use
of air-conditioning and there is no ex-post correction of the proto-
col based on the real-world performance of vehicles. So although
the real world (cid:1) certification gap will be reduced to a certain
extent a measurable difference is likely to remain. Due to the

gets until year 2021.

7. Summary discussion and conclusions

PSeveral studies have focused on the issue of the gap between
real-world and vehicle certification fuel consumption and CO2 emis-
sions. Passenger car emissions are reported to be higher in real-
world driving conditions compared to the official laboratory test-
based values. The present (2014(cid:1)2015) gap is estimated to be of the
order of 30D
X(cid:1)40% while there are sources claiming that it reaches as
much as 50%. For an average European passenger car, which is
reported to emit in 2015 slightly more than 120 gCO2/km, this gap
translates in an extra 36(cid:1)48 gCO2/km or an increase of fuel con-
sumption of about 1.5 to 2 l/100 km (petrol equivalent). This corre-
sponds to a significant increase in the operating costs of vehicles in
realD
X-world driving conditions. A conclusion common in almost all
studies is that the gap has been increasing with time. This trend can
be traced back to a series of factors related to the actual use of
vehicles (e.g. frequent use of A/C systems, electric auxiliaries, traffic
conditions) and test related shortcomings. Some researchers con-
clude that the introduction of European mandatory CO2 targets in
2009 pushed vehicle OEMs to optimize the fuel consumption over
the official cycle taking advantage in several cases of the margins
allowed by an old and to some extent outdated test procedure. These
margins are also the topic of various studies with an approximate
influence estimated to be between 10 and 20%. This range has been
also demonstrated by recent tests conducted in various countries.

PA series of factors affecting fuel consumption of passenger cars
over laboratory and real-world driving conditions were identified.
Several factors had been thoroughly assessed in previous studies,
such as the influence of ambient temperature on cold start or the
influence of mass increase. For some other factors such as rain or
snow, scarce data were available despite their apparent influence on
vehicle fuel consumption. The majority of the studies reviewed
investigate the impact of these factors on CO2 emissions and/or fuel
consumption over experimental tests undertaken on-road or in the
laboratory. In fewer cases simulation and other analytic approaches
are used for quantifying the effect. One of the difficulties in pooling
together all this information and extracting quantifiable results is
the absence of a common reference. Indeed the baseline in each
study is different as are the test conditions and the vehicle under
investigation. In order to consolidate the information collected, the
reported effect of each factor on consumption or emissions was nor-
malized and expressed as a percentile effect on CO2 emissions over
real-world driving conditions when compared to the respective lab-
oratory reference test. The median D
Xof these normalized values can
be considered as an indicator of each factor's potential impact on
fuel consumption (Table 7.1). In addition to the median value, the
standard deviation of the findings is provided as a measure of the
spread of the results and the accordance between different studies.
The standard deviation, together with the extreme values found,
provide a first estimate of the uncertainty associated with the quan-
tification of the effect of each factor. It is observed that for most fac-
tors the value of the standard deviation is comparable or even
higher than the median value. Hence, there is a high uncertainty in
these estimations and also a high dispersion of the results from dif-
ferent studies. The latter occurs due to a number of reasons such as
the use of different types of vehicles and the absence of common
protocols and testing procedures.

PThe information of Table 7.1 was used for formulating a scenario
on the passenger car real-world CO2 emissions and for calculating
an indicative value for the CO2 gap in 2015. The characteristics
of the vehicle considered in the calculation correspond to those of
the average European passenger car as presented in Table 2.1

P(120 gCO2/km, 1380 kg, 1600 cc). Wherever it was necessary to
translate from fuel consumption to CO2 emissions a fuel mix of 46%
Xand 54% diesel was considered and a weighted average value
petrol D
was used. The main assumptions made for this “real-world” opera-
tion scenario were the following:

P(cid:3) A flat 15% increase was considered due to the test protocol flexi-
bilities; 6% originated from optimal adjustments of the certifica-
tion vehicle compared to the production vehicles, 5% originated
from the protocol design and its foreseen boundaries and 4%
reflected the fixed homologation tolerance allowed.

P(cid:3) An additional mass equal to 100 kg was assumed accounting for
an occupancy rate of 1.5 person/vehicle, extra luggage and addi-
tional equipment compared to the certification vehicle

P(cid:3) An increase of 2% in CO2 emissions was assumed D

Xreflecting an
increased aerodynamic resistance due to factors such as side-
winds, lower average air density, open windows, differences in
vehicle body/shape

P(cid:3) A 20% increase in rolling resistance was considered (2.4%
increase in emissions), 15% of which is attributed to the use of
lower energy class replacement tyres and 5% to the combined
effect of winter tyres, deflated tyres and driving on wet roads
P(cid:3) The weighted effect of annual temperature variation on vehicle
cold start emissions was estimated to be 2.9%; vehicle operation
was assumed to take place at four different ambient tempera-
tures 4, 12, 20 and 28 °C for 15, 35, 35 and 15% of the year
respectively resulting in a mean annual temperature of 14 °C.
P(cid:3) Additional auxiliary electric loads were set equal to 250 W

resulting in additional 6 gCO2/km

P(cid:3) A constant increase of 2.5% was considered to account for the
hysteresis in fuel consumption when driving at mild road grades
of 0.5(cid:1)1% (zero altitude change)

P(cid:3) An additional fuel consumption of 0.5 l/100 km due to the use
of air-conditioning for 50% of the year (temperatures > 20 °C)
resulting in a weighted average increase of 5%

PFinally, the effect of the traffic conditions should be taken into
account. Increases and decreases in fuel consumption and CO2 emis-
sions can occur, depending on the mix of traffic conditions, when
comparing against conditions similar to those experienced over a
cycle/trip with characteristics similar to those of the NEDC. The
NEDC has a relatively mild mix of 36% urban driving and 64% extra
urban driving with a total average speed of 33 km/h. Based on the
results presented in Section 4.4, in the majority of traffic conditions
fuel consumption lies between §15% of the fuel consumption expe-
rienced at 33 km/h. The same range was assumed as the lower
and upper boundary of the real-world emissions calculated in this
exercise.

PFig. 7.1 presents the results of the gap calculation broken down
to the main contributing factors. Starting from a baseline of
120 gCO2/km, an additional 18 gCO2/km would account for the mar-
gins of the present certification test and a more realistic baseline for
an average European car would be at 138 gCO2/km. With the main
test margins addressed, an emissions level of 140 gCO2/km could be
considered as the low starting point of the upcoming WTLP certifica-
tion scheme (16% increase compared to baseline). Other vehicle
related factors such as mass, aerodynamics and road loads contrib-
ute another 10.4 gCO2/km to the gap, 4.4, 2.6 and 3.4 gCO2/km
respectively each. Part of their effect is also likely to be captured by
the WLTP as more strict definitions for vehicle mass and road loads
are foreseen, which take into account the least favourable conditions
(e.g. lowest energy class tyres, vehicle with higher aerodynamic
resistance). The effect of annual temperature variation on cold start
was estimated to contribute another 4.1 gCO2/km. When including
the temperature effect, vehicle emissions reach at 152.6 gCO2/km, a
value that could be viewed as the highest end point of the WLTP

extracted from literature. Error bars indicate the minimum(cid:1)maximum values.

P(26.5% increase compared to baseline). Further to these contributors,
additional electric consumption over realistic conditions, road grade
and air conditioning would add an extra 5.9, 3.5 and 5.9 g/km
respectively increasing the total real-world emissions to 168 gCO2/
km. The latter translates in a CO2 gap of 40%, a value that is in line
with the observations of several studies (see Fig. 2.2 and Table 1.1).
Of course this estimate does not take into account the possible traffic
conditions in which a vehicle may operate, but should be considered
as an indicative average situation. Traffic conditions add substantial
uncertainty to the calculation. Real-world emissions of the same
vehicle could reach up to 193 gCO2/km in cases of intense traffic or
when driving at very high speeds. Similarly emissions could be as

Plow as 142.8 gCO2/km for mild speed, free-flow driving. In such
extremes the difference from official emissions would be 61% and
19% respectively.

PThe above calculation should be viewed from a qualitative per-
spective rather than from a strictly quantitative one. The uncertainty
behind the qualified assumptions made for the calculation remains
high and difficult to quantify. In addition there are other factors
influencing the performance of vehicles in real world. In reality not
all factors are equally present. Calculations of higher accuracy would
require the application of in-use weighing factors on each individual
factor in Table 7.1 to account for its share in real-world operation.
Highly influential factors, such as trailer towing, rarely occur hence

Ptheir contribution in the CO2 gap is minimal. On the other hand,
some factors, which on a first view appear less influential (e.g. side
winds), might have a more significant contribution to the gap as
vehicles are exposed to side winds when driven in highway condi-
tions. Unfortunately, only scarce information can be found in exist-
ing literature that would allow a robust calculation of a realistic in-
use share for each factor. Few studies are investigating how vehicles
are actually used in real life, despite the fact that the real-world ver-
sus type approval fuel consumption gap is being frequently studied.
In conclusion, the values presented here regarding the real-world
CO2 gap could be viewed as a realistic estimate of an average Euro-
pean situation on which additional more focused and thorough
research can be based in order to support policy initiatives in the
future and technology development in the future.

PThe upcoming WLTP is expected to address many of the limita-
tions of the current legislation,
including several of the issues
highlighted in this paper. The values provided by the WLTP are
expected to be closer to real-world driving conditions by about 26 §
6 gCO2/km. However, WLTP cannot fully bridge the gap. The lack of
quantified understanding of the real-world driving conditions is a
problem that has to be addressed even after the new testing protocol
is established in Europe. The main reason is that no single test, no
matter how sophisticated and well designed, will ever be represen-
tative of the real-world operation of all vehicles and conditions.
There are factors affecting fuel consumption in everyday operation
which are neither included in the test nor easily identified. In order
to reduce the gap and ensure that the on-road emissions are within
a reasonable margin, there should be established some form of vehi-
cle in-use monitoring contributing to the strategic target of reducing
overall CO2 emissions from the transport in the future. Vehicle man-
ufacturers will eventually learn how to optimize vehicle perfor-
mance over the new test procedure. Hence, attention should focus
on the evolution of the gap over time, which shall not increase pro-
gressively, and on the underlying factors causing it. Furthermore,
technology progresses fast and D
Xany test procedure sooner or later
becomes outdated. Given the pace of new technology development,
a more dynamic approach should be foreseen, including verification
activities, continuous research on the topic and real-world data col-
lection. Some form of ex-post calculation of the gap or correction of

Pthe in-use emissions estimates will be necessary for environmental,
policy or consumer information purposes. Even if part of the road
transport sector becomes electrified, the need to reduce energy con-
sumption of vehicles will remain as mobility needs will continue to
grow.

PAt this point it should be stressed that defining a single pan-Euro-
pean CO2 emission targets and gap correction factors may not be the
most effective approach for reducing road transport CO2 emissions
in real world. Each region has its own characteristics, particularities
and mobility needs. Proposing actions tailored at regional level
would maximize the CO2 benefits but is very difficult due to the lack
of data and information sources. Even at regional level, environmen-
tal, traffic and vehicle operating conditions may vary significantly
making any estimates difficult to validate and policy initiatives diffi-
cult to assess. As discussed previously, there is a lack of consistent
information generation and data collection practices that would
facilitate the definition of a more precise “reality” and enable more
accurate estimates of the real-world fuel consumption. These are
issues which should be raised for further discussion by researchers,
policy makers and other stakeholders, i.e. how additional informa-
tion on traffic, environmental conditions, and vehicle characteristics
can be generated and made available for more targeted research and
in-depth analysis.

PAchieving sustainable mobility is a challenge that surpasses the
borders of individual countries or regions. It is important for the
global scientific community to revisit the issue of road transport CO2
emissions in a more systematic manner if we are to achieve the tran-
sition to a low-carbon transport sector.
