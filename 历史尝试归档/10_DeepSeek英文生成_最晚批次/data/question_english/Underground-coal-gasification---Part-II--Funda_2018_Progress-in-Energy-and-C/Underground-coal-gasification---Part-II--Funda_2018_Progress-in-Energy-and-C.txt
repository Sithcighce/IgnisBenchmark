Underground coal gasification can convert deep coal into synthesis gas for use in the production of electric-
ity, fuels and chemicals. This paper provides a review of the fundamental physical phenomena in under-
ground coal gasification and associated modeling efforts. The relevant fundamentals of coal gasification are
described and the phenomena of cavity growth at the sidewall and roof of the underground cavity are
examined in detail. The transport phenomena and chemical reactions occurring in the permeable bed of
char and ash and the void space are reviewed. The modeling of the transport of heat and mass, including
contaminants, in the near- and far-fields surrounding an underground coal gasifier are also summarized. An
overview of the geomechanical phenomena and the coupled interactions between transport and mechani-
cal phenomena are provided. Finally, integrated UCG models are reviewed and recommendations for future
model development are provided.

1. Introduction

PUnderground coal gasification (UCG) is the process of convert-
ing hydrocarbon materials into synthesis gas in-situ. The process
has been developed over more than a century and many aspects
of the process are well understood. Despite this, no large scale
commercial UCG plants have been constructed recently, with
only one Soviet-era plant from the 1960s still operating in Uzbe-
kistan. Various articles and studies indicate that UCG is techni-
cally feasible and economically attractive as a method to utilize
the energy of deep coal resources (e.g. [1(cid:1)8]) and there is ongo-
ing interest to develop the technology in several nations with
large coal reserves, such as China, India, Pakistan, Bulgaria and
Poland [9(cid:1)12].

PReviews on UCG have been reported by Gregg and Edgar [13],
Shafirovich et al. [14], Bhutto et al. [15] and Khan et al. [16]. This
paper, which is Part II of a two part series, focuses on the fundamen-
tal physical phenomena occurring within UCG together with associ-
ated modeling efforts. Fig. 1 shows a schematic of an underground
coal gasifier and the main zones which are reviewed in this paper,
including the sidewall and roof, the permeable bed, the void space
and the near-field which immediately surrounds a UCG cavity.
Beyond the near-field, there exists the far-field which is not shown
on Fig. 1. The physics of cavity growth, permeable bed gasification
and transport phenomena in the void spaces within a developing
cavity are comprehensively examined in this work. The controlling
physics in the various regions of the gasifier are investigated and the
transport and geomechanical phenomena in the near- and far-fields
surrounding an underground coal gasifier are reviewed. Collectively,
this work provides a comprehensive review of the fundamental

Pphenomena and mathematical modeling of underground coal gasifi-
cation.

2. Phenomena of coal gasification in UCG

2.1. Coal pyrolysis

PThe first stage of coal gasification in UCG, is the slow heating and
pyrolysis of large blocks of coal. Moisture is evaporated at low tem-
peratures (»100 °C) and at higher temperatures (»350(cid:1)600 °C)
pyrolysis occurs over many hours and is accompanied by simulta-
neous changes in chemical and physical structure [17(cid:1)19]. Heating
rates in UCG are on the order of 1 to 10 °C/min, which is much slower
than in other coal gasification technologies, such as fixed and fluid-
ized beds. For low rank coals with moisture contents greater than
»15 wt% coal pyrolysis leads to extensive decrepitation, increases
porosity and permeability and leads to shrinkage and fissuring of the
coal matrix [20,21]. Under in situ conditions, it is believed that many
lower rank coals fail mechanically, breaking into pieces and falling
into the developing cavity, in a process known as thermo-mechani-
cal spalling [22]. The relatively high volatile content of low rank
coals makes them easier to ignite and the decrepitation of the coal
matrix increases the surface area available for reaction and does not
inhibit the transport of heat and mass [20]. High rank coals, such as
bituminous coals, are more likely to soften and may go through a
plastic phase, in which gas bubbles form from the release of volatile
matter, grow and migrate through the softened coal matrix inhibit-
ing heat and mass transport [23].

PExperimental studies performed with small coal particles show
that the ultimate yield of the volatiles released from the coal

Fig. 1. Schematic of an underground coal gasifier and the main zones discussed in this
review.

Pdecreases as the pressure is increased [18,24]. In UCG, heating rates
are slow, so the residence time of the volatiles in contact with the
hot char are long, providing the opportunity for secondary reactions,
such as cracking of tar [25]. Campbell reported the gas evolution and
char compositions of a low-rank coal under slow heating rate condi-
tions [26]. Table 1 shows a summary of the common pyrolysis mod-
els. Much of the prior work has focused on fast pyrolysis at
atmospheric pressure of small particles representative of the condi-
tions found during pulverized coal combustion (e.g. [17,27,28].).
According to Solomon gas formation from coal pyrolysis can be mod-
eled reasonably well by multiple first order kinetics and with a dis-
tribution of activation energies, but tar and char formation is more
complex [29]. As a result it is recommended that single step, multi-
ple step and distributed activation energy (DAE) models for coal
pyrolysis are most suitable for use in UCG modeling.

PAn implication of the low temperature operation of UCG is that
some heavy molecular weight products such as tars, benzene, tolu-
ene and so forth, will not be completely cracked to smaller mole-
cules. A portion of these components may remain trapped in the
coal or underground cavity and can have negative effects on the
environment. Proper site selection and operation of the process can
minimize and mitigate the potential adverse effects as discussed in
Part I [30].

2.2. Char reactivity and gasification kinetics

PThe most important chemical reactions taking place in an under-
ground coal gasifier are summarized in Table 2. These include evapo-
ration of moisture (R1), pyrolysis (R2),
the char combustion
reactions (R3, R4) and the char gasification reactions with steam
(R5), carbon dioxide (R6) and hydrogen (R7). Gas phase combustion
reactions (R8(cid:1)R11), the water gas shift reaction (R12) and the
steam-methane reforming reaction (R13). Reforming of higher
hydrocarbons (R14) and cracking/reforming of tar (R15) are also
present. Reactions involving other higher molecular weight hydro-
carbons released during pyrolysis may be significant [44], and reac-
tions involving nitrogen and sulfur are important for determining
the minor species and contaminants present in the syngas [45,46].

PModeling work indicates that char reactivity is not as important
in UCG as many other factors, such as the water influx rate into the
coal seam or the thermo-mechanical behavior of coal [47]. Field
scale demonstrations have mostly been undertaken in low rank coals
which have a relatively high reactivity, and this may be further
enhanced by minerals in the ash that catalyze the char gasification
reactions [48]. High rank coals are less porous, less reactive and have
lower moisture and volatile matter contents than low rank coals.
Therefore gasification reactions rates are likely to be much lower

cussed in the work of Roberts, Harris and co-workers [49(cid:1)53] and

PIn UCG modeling, using Eq. 2 should be sufficient to derive
the char gasification kinetics from experiments and to use for
forecasting performance, when applied over the narrow pres-
sure range planned for the gasification project. Internal mass
transfer effects may be incorporated through the inclusion of

2.3. Char structure and internal mass transport

PThe porous structure of the char created by pyrolysis effects
internal heat and mass transport and therefore impacts on the over-
all reactivity of the char. Unlike coal particle gasification, reactants
of steam and CO2 from moisture evaporation and pyrolysis can be
supplied continuously by heat transfer into the coal block in UCG as
well as being supplied via external mass transfer from the void space
and/or permeable bed [47,60].

PThe effective reactivity of the char is a function of its intrinsic
reactivity, the total available surface area and the diffusion of the
reactants and products within its porous structure [61]. Fig. 2 shows
microscopic images of the exposed surfaces of coal monoliths after
drying, pyrolysis and partial combustion. The development of
micro-cracks are clearly evident.

PCoals exhibit a complex pore structure, with micro-, meso- and
macro-pores present in most coals [63]. Generally, high rank coals
are more microporous, while low rank coals are more macroporous
in nature. A number of models for pore structure have been reported
in the literature, including the average pore structure model of
Wheeler [64] and the random pore model of Bhatia and Gavalas

P[65,66]. The random pore model reproduces the increase in surface
area with conversion at low conversions and the decrease at high
conversions, observed in experimental studies of char particle gasifi-
cation [67]. Perkins used a bi-modal representation of the pore
structure in a model of UCG coal block gasification [60].

PHowever, despite many different models for pore diffusion, most
coal gasifier models do not explicitly model it, and those that do,
normally use simple representations of the pore structure and ignore
its evolution as a function of conversion. Many models in the litera-
ture use effective reaction rates based on the external surface area of
the particle, which implicitly include the combined effects of chemi-
cal kinetics and pore diffusion. This approach is popular for modeling
moving bed gasifiers, in which gasification occurs at moderate tem-
peratures (see for example Hobbs et al. [68(cid:1)70], Syamlal [71], and
Di Blasi [72,73]). When gasification is performed at high tempera-
tures (> 1500 K), diffusion processes have a greater potential to limit
the reaction rate, leading researchers to incorporate more detailed
submodels for pore structure evolution into their models. For exam-
ple Beath incorporated a random pore model into a 1D entrained
flow gasifier model [74] and Liu included detailed pore evolution in
a model for entrained flow gasification [75,76].

PDetailed modeling of intrinsic kinetics and pore diffusion may not
be critically important in a global underground coal gasifier model. It
is also worth noting, that experimental data on the pore structure
and intrinsic reactivity of coal chars is only available for a small

Psubset of coals, and the data that is available has generally been
obtained under high heating rate conditions using candidate coals
for use in entrained flow gasification [24]. For UCG there is a need to
characterize coal chars from coal block and/or coal particle gasifica-
tion experiments under representative conditions, such as slow
heating rates and high pressure.

PThe multi-component gaseous diffusion in coal is usually calcu-
lated using the Stefan(cid:1)Maxwell equations in the gas film and a bi-
dispersed dusty gas model in the dried coal matrix [60,77,78]. Both
binary diffusion and Knudsen diffusion are important in the small
pores of the coal matrix. Representing the cleat structure and the
development of cracks during pyrolysis and gasification should also
be important for forecasting the progression of UCG, however to
date there is little published work focusing on these aspects.

2.4. Homogeneous reactions

PIt is expected that turbulent mixing will be an important trans-
port mechanism in UCG (see Sections 3 and 5), therefore global
kinetic models using either a one-step or two-step formulation
together with a representation of turbulent mixing rates are consid-
ered to be adequate to model the homogeneous reactions. While
more complex schemes exist for modeling homogeneous flames
(see for example Westbrook et al. [79,80], Jones and Lindstedt [81]
and Ranzi et al. [82]), the priority areas for further model develop-
ment are associated with the heterogeneous reaction rates and the
behavior of coal upon heating in the underground environment. A
generic one-step model of gaseous fuel combustion is:

Fuel þ n1O2 ! n2CO2 þ n3H2O;
ð3Þ
where the stoichometric co-efficients, ni, are determined by the
choice of fuel [79]. A general one-step reaction rate is usually
expressed as:

where n, a and b are exponents; the values of a and b depend on the
assumed rate controlling step in the detailed combustion mecha-
nism. The above reaction rate form can be further generalized for all
homogeneous reactions to a power law form:

Ppotentially have a great impact on the composition of syngas from
underground coal gasification are the water gas shift reaction (R12)
and the methanation reaction (R13).

2.5. Transport phenomena and model classes

PThe transport phenomena in porous media can be modeled using
a set of convection(cid:1)diffusion equations which represent the conser-
vation of mass and momentum for each phase, the conservation of
mass for each chemical species and the conservation of energy.
Table 5 shows an example of the main conservation equations for
the transport phenomena formulated in differential form [84(cid:1)86].
In general four phases can be identified within an underground coal
gasifier: gas, water, oil and solid. The oil phase, being mostly con-
densed tars, will be present in only very localized regions, while the
solid phase consists of reactive components such as volatiles and
fixed carbon (char) and inerts such as mineral matter/ash and rock.
Fig. 3 shows a representative elemental volume (REV) within the
coal reservoir.

PEach UCG model involves a selection of the relevant phases, con-
servation equations and applicable models for physical properties,
constitutive relationships and source terms. Based on these selec-
tions, the mathematical models of the UCG process can be divided
into classes: process models, coal block models, coal wall models,
packed bed models, channel models, computational fluid dynamic
models, resource recovery models and reservoir models. Table 6 out-
lines the characteristics of these model classes.

PThe implications of these large range of time and length scales for
modeling UCG is that models generally can only represent detailed
phenomena across a subset of this range and must approximate
details at substantially smaller scales using sub-models or simplifi-
cations. This leads to the classes of models shown in Table 6. A major
challenge for the modeler, is how to incorporate and represent sub-
scale phenomena within each model.

3. Phenomena in the sidewall and roof

PThe behavior of the sidewall and roof determine how the UCG
cavity grows and hence, the overall performance of the process. The
main mechanisms for cavity growth are: i) chemical reaction, ii)
thermo-mechanical (spalling) failure and iii) bulk mechanical col-
lapse [87]. Fig. 4 shows a representation of the gasification of a block
of coal. In the following sections the laboratory experiments on coal
gasification of small cores and large blocks are summarized, before
the main mechanisms of cavity growth are reviewed in detail.

3.1. Laboratory experiments

PLaboratory experiments for investigating underground coal gasi-

fication include use of particles, small cores and larger blocks.

P3.1.1. Gasification using small cores

PThe objective of experimental studies with small cores or lumps
of coal is usually to measure the rate of penetration of the drying,
pyrolysis and gasification fronts and to determine the rate control-
ling mechanism of the process. Previous experimental studies have
mostly focused on atmospheric combustion and gasification,
in
which the controlling mechanism is mass transfer. Forrester con-
ducted pyrolysis and gasification experiments on cylindrical coal
cores and measured the penetration rate of the drying front into the
coal in a reducing atmosphere [89]. Wellborn undertook combustion

Pexperiments using Texas lignite cores mounted vertically in a com-
bustion chamber [90]. The coal cores were 1 cm in diameter. Well-
born found a linear relationship between the burning rate and the
oxygen concentration in the feed gas [90]. Massaquoi and Riggs
developed a comprehensive model for the combustion and gasifica-
tion of a wet coal block and compared the model’s outputs with the
experimental results of Wellborn [91,92].

PThe combustion behavior of Texas lignite cores was studied at
atmospheric pressure in a laboratory reactor [93]. It was found that
the burn rate was a linear function of the oxygen mole fraction, pro-
viding evidence to support the conclusion that the reaction was
mass transfer controlled. Higher blast temperatures also showed a
direct correlation with the burn rate [93]. During the combustion
experiments, cores orientated parallel to the bedding plane shrank
by 20%, while those orientated perpendicular to the bedding plane
did not shrink at all [93]. Shrinkage was caused by the release of
moisture and volatiles from the coal matrix and it was found that
coal cores orientated parallel to the bedding plane were able to sup-
port themselves, unlike those orientated perpendicular to the bed-
ding plane [93]. The experiments of Poon showed that the ash layer
presents a significant barrier to the transport of mass to and from
the coal surface [93].

PIn a study by Yeary and Riggs [94], 30 cm blocks of coal were
exposed to hot gases at atmospheric pressure and orientated either
parallel or perpendicular to the bedding plane. Two coals were used
in the study — a Texas lignite and a subbituminous coal from Hanna,
Wyoming [94]. The sidewall tests, in which the coal was orientated
with the bedding plane parallel to the horizontal, showed that aver-
age recession rates for the lignite were 0.61 cm/h at 1200 K and
0.93 cm/h at 1300 K [94]. This compared with measured recession
rates of 1.23 cm/h at 1200 K and 1.62 cm/h at 1300 K with the subbi-
tuminous coal. Sidewall and roof growth in underground coal gasifi-
cation was
simulated in the experiments by changing the
orientation of the coal block. In the sidewall experiments, small

Plocalized areas of ash detached from the surface of the coal char. In
the roof experiments, the bedding plane was set perpendicular to
the horizontal, and structural failure of the lignite was observed. The
spalling of the lignite was attributed to the presence of clay stringers
in the coal, which resulted in differential thermal expansion of the
coal upon heating and led to delamination and structural failure of
the coal matrix [94]. Spalling was not observed in the roof growth
tests conducted with the subbituminous coal [94].

PBell conducted combustion tube experiments using crushed coal
using two size fractions and compared the results with field demon-
strations [95]. He recorded the rate of penetration of the drying
front, the pyrolysis front and gasification front in eight experiments.
The drying, pyrolysis and gasification front velocities varied from 0.1
to 0.7 m/h, which are comparable with field measurements [47]. Bell
showed that the combustion tube performance data compared well
with field measurements from the Hanna demonstration project
when correlated with the parameter of heat loss plus latent heat of
influx water [95].

PXi et al. investigated the pyrolysis and swelling behavior of lignite
particles of diameter »1 mm and lumps of size »50 mm when
heated up to 900 °C [21]. They found that most of the swelling
occurred between 100 and 600 °C and that the gas released during
pyrolysis of the lumps was richer in CO and H2 than the gas from the
particles. It was also reported that the high temperature heat treat-
ment led to the formation of a highly porous and permeable char
around the gasification channel [21].

P3.1.2. Gasification using large blocks

PThe combustion and gasification of large coal blocks at pressure
in ex-situ reactors allows more representative conditions to be sim-
ulated in the laboratory. Early experiments focused on the pyrolysis,
combustion and gasification at atmospheric pressure [96,97].
Creighton and Thorsness studied the gasification of a coal block initi-
ated through a 1 cm borehole [98]. A series of gasification tests were
conducted on large blocks at the WIDCO mine at Centralia, Washing-
ton by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory [99(cid:1)101]. Prabu
and Jayanti have reported on the examination of the gasification
zone after gasification experiments on wood and coal using air, oxy-
gen and steam [102,103]. Fig. 5 shows photos of the dissected coal
blocks after gasification with oxygen and steam mixtures. The
experiments show that a tear-drop shaped reaction zone develops
around the oxidant injection location. Inorganic ash residues remain
after the reaction zone has converted the hydrocarbons into gas.
Measurements also showed that the heat affected zone around the
periphery of the gasification zone was several centimeters thick
[103]. Significant loss of moisture and volatiles was recorded in the
heat affected zone. Under air gasification conditions, the loss of
moisture from the coal, led to a reduction in the gasification rate due
to the Boudouard reaction, and highlighted the importance of steam
in gasifying hard and less reactive coals [103]. In many papers
(including this one), the reaction zone is often referred to as a cavity.
It is important to recognize that the “cavity” is not completely
empty, but filled with permeable mineral matter residues and
unconverted coal and char as seen in the laboratory photographs
and excavations of field demonstrations [104,105].

PFacilities which are currently active in conducting ex situ com-
bustion and gasification experiments with large coal blocks exist at
the Chinese University of Mining Technology (CUMT), Beijing, the
Central Mining Institute in Poland, the Institute of Control and Infor-
mation of Production Processes at Technical University of Kosice in
the Solvak Republic [106] and Center for Environmental Science and
Disaster Mitigation for Advanced Research at the Muroran Institute
of Technology, Japan.

PFig. 6 shows a photo of the ex-situ UCG reactor facility at the
CUMT, Beijing. The facility can be tilted on an angle to simulate dip-
ping coal seams [107]. Experimental results and mathematical

Pmodeling has been reported by Yang and co-workers [108(cid:1)111]. Liu
et al. examined the minerals remaining after gasification with oxy-
gen enriched oxidants using 40%-O2 and 80%-O2 [112].

PThe Central Mining Institute in Poland has constructed an ex situ
UCG reactor as seen in Fig. 7. The feasibility of gasifying lignite and
hard coals using air and oxygen have been investigated [113(cid:1)115].
In a recent paper, Kapusta et al. investigated the feasibility of gasify-
ing high-moisture lignites [116]. While a syngas with a heating value
of up to 10 MJ/Nm3 was obtained, the energy efficiency using oxygen
blown gasification was only 59% and the low mechanical strength of
lignites was identified as a potential issue for exploitation on a larger
scale [116]. The production of hydrogen from coal gasification was
also studied with lignite and hard coal, using a two-stage approach
where oxygen and steam were injected in an alternating sequence
to generate a hydrogen rich syngas [117,118].

PSu et al. at the Muroran Institute of Technology have focused on
developing acoustic emission (AE) techniques to monitor the cavity

PThe appropriate selection of a mass transfer co-efficient depends
on the nature of the fluid flow occurring in the void spaces adjacent
to the wall. The Sherwood number is Sh1⁄4 hmL
; where hm is the co-
D
efficient of mass transfer. Mass transfer can occur via forced convec-
tion due to an external force such pressure difference, or natural
convection via differences in density of the fluid. The mass transfer
rate at the coal wall is typically correlated with the Reynolds number
(Re) for forced convection and the Grashof number (Gr) for natural
1⁄4 a RebScc and Shnc 1⁄4 a GrbScc where a, b,
convection, using: Shfc
and c are co-efficients to be determined through fitting of the equa-
tions to the experimental data. For turbulent natural convection,
Grashof numbers higher than about 109 are required.

PEarly thinking in UCG assumed that forced convection was the
dominating mass transfer mechanism, but modeling studies could
not explain field observations [123]. Eddy and Schwarz [124,125]
showed that heat and mass transfer rates resulting from natural con-
vection were up to an order of magnitude greater than forced con-
vection rates under typical conditions. Comparison of model results
with estimates of cavity evolution in the Hanna and Pricetown field
trials, showed reasonable agreement [125]. Bruining et al. [126]
argued that natural convection is important for high pressure gasifi-
cation in thin, deep coal seams. Experimental measurements of tur-
bulent natural convection in a 3D enclosed cavity, were conducted
by van Batenburg, using laser doppler anemometry [127]. The
experiments were conducted at a Rayleigh number of Ra 1⁄4 4 (cid:5) 109;
and reached a steady-state. The orientation of the enclosure was var-
ied by up to 10o, and the walls were configured as either smooth or
rough, with roughness elements approximately 2 mm in height.
Mass transfer rates in the inclined cavity were greater than those in
the vertical cavity, however the differences were small (< 10%).
These experimental findings were used by van Batenburg to justify
the use of a vertical flat plate correlation for natural convection in a
channel model for the gasification of thin seams [127,128]. Table 7
shows the correlations used for modeling mass transfer to the side-
wall from a selection of prior work.

PDetailed modeling using the Navier(cid:1)Stokes equations for natu-
ral convection in inclined enclosures under laminar and turbulent
conditions in two and three dimensions was performed by Kuyper
using a finite volume computer code [130]. As shown in Fig. 9,
good agreement was achieved between the correlation for a
heated cavity (see Table 7) and the computational fluid dynamic
simulations.

PPerkins has made estimates of the Sherwood number and bound-
ary layer thickness using the relationship: Sh 1⁄4 L=d [88] (see Table 8).
The calculated estimates indicate that Sherwood numbers are in the
order of 101(cid:1)103. It can be seen that Sherwood numbers for turbu-
lent natural convection are 2(cid:1)3 orders of magnitude larger than for
turbulent forced convection.

PThe ash layer may impede mass transfer of oxygen to the coal and
gasification products into the void space [47]. Recently, Lin et al.
investigated the effect of an ash layer on syngas combustion using a
Chinese low volatile bituminous coal at 1250 °C and 1300 °C and
reported that the ash layer does not inhibit the diffusion of oxygen
until it is thicker than 1.3 mm [131]. When the ash layer is thick,
exothermic combustion of CO occurs in the ash layer, with the endo-
thermic gasification of char occurring at the ash/char interface [131].
The high temperatures of combustion occurring in the ash layer, can
cause ash melting and the formation of slag, depending upon the
properties of the ash [112].

PThe implications for UCG modeling are that natural convection
dominates the mass transfer rate from the void spaces to the coal
wall, but the overall rate may be limited by mass transfer through
the ash layer if it is not molten. The detailed behaviors of ash forma-
tion, melting and slagging on heat and mass transfer need to be
approximated by the modeler. The ash mass transfer behavior may
be approximated by using an effective mass transfer co-efficient or

Pgrowth and fracturing behavior of coal blocks during gasification
[119,120]. Recently, researchers at Hokkaido University and the
Muroran Institute of Technology have observed the initiation of
radial cracks in UCG model tests and attributed these to thermal
contraction during coal carbonization [121].

3.2. Cavity growth due to chemical reaction

PThe factors which may control the rate of cavity growth due to
chemical reaction include: external heat and mass transfer, internal
heat and mass transfer and chemical kinetics. Fig. 8 shows a repre-
sentation of the rate of cavity growth as a function of temperature
and the regimes of the rate controlling phenomena, including bulk
diffusion, pore diffusion and chemical reaction.

P3.2.1. Mass transfer to the sidewall

PMass transfer processes in the void space can affect the rate at
which the cavity grows at the sidewall and the roof, through trans-
port of the key reactants of steam, CO2 and to a much lesser extent
H2, from the turbulent core through the boundary layer and to the
wall. The transfer of mass to and from the sidewall can be repre-
sented by:

where F is a view factor for the radiant heat exchange, Tg is the bulk
gas temperature and Tw is the wall temperature. The radiative heat
transfer inside the gasifier is partially non-transparent due to the
presence of gas species such as CO2 and H2O which emit and absorb
radiation. Table 9 shows selected expressions of the heat transfer
co-efficients, in term of the Nusselt number Nu 1⁄4 hL
λ ; used in prior
work.

PCombustion in the gas phase and gasification of the char leads to
Tg > Tw [131] and the heat flux to the sidewall is typically dominated
by radiant heat transfer, but may become limited by heat conduction
through the ash layer. Perkins calculated that the cavity growth rate
decreased from »0.7 to »0.1 m/day when the ash layer thickness
increased from 0 to 0.01 m under steam/O2 blown gasification condi-
tions with a gas temperature of Tg 1⁄4 1500 K [88].

PFig. 10 shows a comparison of the heat flux due to various modes
of heat transfer to the sidewall. The calculations assume: Ra 1⁄4 1010;
Re 1⁄4 500; 000; Tw 1⁄4 1100 K, view factor F 1⁄4 1; an ash layer thickness
of 0.01 m, ash thermal conductivity from Massaquoi and Riggs [91]
and the heat transfer correlations of Eddy and Schwarz from Table 9.
The rate of heat conduction through the ash layer is about one third
of the radiant heat flux and the rates of heat transfer due to forced

Pand natural convection are two orders of magnitude smaller. Rela-
tions for the thermal properties of coal and ash can be found in
various references (e.g. [91,92,125].) and Merrick undertook an
extensive investigation of the evolution of the properties of coal in
coke ovens [132(cid:1)136].

PThe implications for UCG modeling are that radiative heat trans-
fer dominates, but that the overall rate of heat transfer to the coal
wall may be limited by conduction through the ash layer.

P3.2.3. Chemical reaction of the sidewall

PA number of modelers have assumed that chemical reaction is
the mechanism which controls cavity growth (e.g. [128,130,137].).
Direct removal of the carbon at the char-gas interface by combustion
reactions with oxygen has been suggested as the main cause of cav-
ity growth in the early stages of a gasifier [138]. Table 10 shows the
chemical reaction rate expressions used by a number of authors.
Massaquoi and Riggs applied an effective reaction rate including the
impact of chemical equilibrium [91]. Van Batenburg developed an
expression for a cylindrical pore [127], while Perkins derived an
expression for an infinitely long pore [88]. Kuyper applied the
assumption of chemical and thermal equilibrium at the char inter-
face [130]. Perkins and Sahajwalla implemented the random pore
model with a bi-modal pore distribution [60], and more recently
Samdani et al. have also used the random pore model [139].

PThe choice of reaction rate expression is dependent upon the
available kinetic data and the modeler. Most of the char reactivity
data used in UCG modeling has been derived from small particles
subjected to fast heating rates. In future, it is recommended that the
reaction rate expression is derived from laboratory experiments on
char derived from slow pyrolysis of coal cores obtained from explor-
atory drilling, at temperatures and pressures representative of those
in UCG. Depending upon the experimental work and char characteri-
zation, it would probably be appropriate to either fit an effective rate
expression or an intrinsic reaction rate and pore surface area evolu-
tion expression to the experimental data. The use of an effectiveness
factor is an easy way to model the effects of chemical reaction and
pore diffusion:

PRoberts and Harris [50], Beath [74] and Bliek [140]. For high rank
coals, such as the bituminous coal reported by Bliek [140], the char
reactivity is low in comparison to mass transfer at typical tempera-
tures. The calculations indicate that if UCG is performed in high rank
coals, the rate of cavity growth will be controlled by the chemical
reactivity of the char.

PMost previous UCG field trials have been undertaken in coals
with a lower rank (e.g. subbituminous coals) which generally have a
high char reactivity [48,141]. For these coals the reactivity measure-
ments of Roberts [50] and Beath [74] are considered to be more rep-
resentative and the rate controlling step at typical operating
temperatures is found to be in the combined mass transfer and
chemical kinetics regime. Poon investigated the impact of chemical
kinetics and mass transfer during the combustion of Texas lignites.
He found that diffusion effects were significant for temperatures
between 800 and 1100 K, and that pore diffusion controlled the
mass transfer rate [93].

PA number of models have been reported in the literature which
enable the calculation of the cavity growth rate as a function of vari-
ous coal and operating parameters (e.g. Tsang [96], Massaquoi and
Riggs [91,92], Park and Edgar [138], Beath [142,143], Perkins and
Sahajwalla [47,60]). These models generally incorporate a treatment
of mass transfer and chemical reaction and thus enable the rate con-
trolling mechanism to be determined. For highly reactive coals, such
as lignites, external mass transfer control appears to be possible,
assuming that heat and mass transport is not inhibited by an ash
layer on the coal surface or the presence of a porous bed of ash and
rock rubble.

PKuyper has shown that the equilibrium assumption for the coal
wall reactions are valid in a channel configuration at moderate to
high pressure and when the oxygen injection rate is < 0.04 mol/s
per meter of channel [130]. Kuyper therefore concluded that in the
channel regime, the gasification process is generally mass transfer
limited. However, for higher oxygen injection rates, lower pressure
and/or for low reactivity coals, the rate of coal consumption becomes
increasingly kinetically limited.

Pwhere m < n, the true order of reaction. Use of such an expression
should be sufficiently accurate for UCG given the uncertainties in
char gasification, including kinetic rates, ash conditions and the
char’s fragmentation behavior.

P3.2.4. Rate controlling mechanisms

PTypical char surface temperatures in UCG are estimated to be
between 1000 and 1500 K, based on the experimental results of
Poon [93] and Wellborn [90], and the numerical modeling of Van
Batenburg [127] and Kuyper [130]. Calculations of chemical reaction
and combined chemical reaction and pore diffusion for a number of
chars over a wide temperature range are shown in Fig. 11, together
with the apparent rates based solely on external mass transfer [88].
Reported intrinsic reactivities were taken from Van Batenburg [127],

char are found in UCG cavities

Pof unconverted coal
(eg.
[104,105,147]). A laboratory investigation of coal spalling of three
coals by Upahye et al. did not reveal significant rates of spalling [87].
This was attributed to the soft nature of coal which may allow the
material to yield to internal stresses through shrinking and delami-
nation [87]. It was also suggested that the lack of an applied load on
the coal block in the experimental procedure was another potential
cause for the lack of observed spalling [87]. Early work confirmed
that the spalling mechanism was induced by temperature gradients,
rather than high temperatures alone [148].

PBhaskaran et al. have investigated gasification and spalling
behavior of Indian lignites [62,149]. They found significant differen-
ces between the behaviors of a hard lignite (with low volatile and
moisture content) and a soft lignite (with high volatile and moisture
content) in an experiment designed to mimic the UCG process. The
hard coal produced a lower calorific value syngas, did not spall sig-
nificantly and had a much lower reactivity than the soft coal which
produced a much higher calorific value syngas and was observed to
spall significantly during the experiments [149]. Bhaskaran et al.
relate these observations to the proximate analysis of the coal, with
the soft coal developing a more porous and reactive surface area dur-
ing heating and pyrolysis due to the higher volatile and moisture
content. In a second paper, Bhaskaran et al. concluded that spalling
in soft coal was due to the formation of vertical micro-cracks during
the initial stages of drying, and the subsequent development of hori-
zontal cracks during drying and pyrolysis, leading to cross-linking of
cracks and the breakage of small pieces of coal from the parent
block, generating spalled material [62]. Fig. 12 shows a schematic of
how Bhasakaran et al. envisage coal spalling [62].

POne consequence of spalling is that it continually exposes fresh
coal to the hot cavity environment, and therefore the average heat
transfer to the coal seam is higher than would be possible by heat
conduction alone [129,150].Since coal is ignited low in the seam,
coal spalling helps form a permeable bed gasifier [13]. In thin seams,
the coal spalling mechanism may be less significant, since the coal
roof will be reached very quickly. Modeling of coal blocks by Perkins
and Sahajwalla found that the spalling behavior is the coal property
that most affects the cavity growth rate [60].

PSu et al. undertook laboratory studies on coal specimens heated
to temperature and observed crack and fracture formation using
acoustic emission (AE) and X-Ray CT scans [119]. The micro-crack
generation was monitored using AE in both small coal samples sub-
jected to heating from a face and in large coal samples subjected to
gasification conditions in an ex-situ reactor [119]. Su et al. found a
positive correlation between the temperature change and AE activ-
ity, with most AE sources located in the ignition area and along the
linkage hole [119] and also applied the technique to monitor coal
gasification in an ex-situ reactor [120]. The impacts of crack initia-
tion and fracturing on the development of UCG as envisaged by Su
et al. is summarized in Fig. 13. Recent work indicates that radial
crack initiation and growth from UCG cavities is driven by thermal
expansion and contraction in the vicinity of the sidewall [121].

P3.3.2. Rock spalling

PBakker et al. performed rock spalling experiments under bi-axial
stress conditions [151] and Hettema studied the thermo-mechanical
behavior of sedimentary rocks exposed to high temperatures [145].
Hettema’s investigation considered the following rock spalling
mechanisms: i) differential thermal expansion, ii) steam pressure
and iii) compressive failure. Hettema concluded that the spalling
process is strongly influenced by the microstructure of the rock
[145], and developed a new theoretical model for the spalling due to
compressive failure, incorporating three different failure criteria:
critical strain-energy density, thermal crack growth and compres-
sive buckling. Experiments on rock spalling included: i) uniform
ii) linear heating rate from one side at
heating experiments,

coal chars for carbon-steam gasification at 1MPa with a steam mole fraction of 0.2.
(from Perkins [88]).

PWall et al. report that in general reaction rates increase with
pressure, however the pyrolysis yield, char reactivity and bulk diffu-
sivity decrease with pressure [24].

P3.2.5. Growth rates

PTo make quick estimates of cavity growth rate (CGR), Najafi et al.
developed a correlation based on non-linear regression of the cavity
growth data from 11 UCG field trials, given by [144]:

which gave a reasonable match to the reported growth rates as
determined from field trials. Since Eq. (9) does not include the
impact of some important parameters such as the oxygen injection
rate, it should be used with caution. However, it may be useful to
make initial estimates of cavity growth rates, before applying funda-
mental models like those discussed in Section 3.4.

3.3. Cavity growth due to thermo-mechanical failure

PIn this mechanism, otherwise known as spalling, the coal or sedi-
mentary rock matrix fractures and small pieces break away from the
parent material and fall into the developing cavity [145]. Spalling is
not that well understood but is thought to be caused by one or a
combination of:- (i) differential thermal expansion, (ii) explosive
fracturing due to steam pressure, (iii) compressive failure or (iv) for-
mation and linking of micro-cracks [146].

PWhat is envisioned is a cyclic process as summarized in the fol-
lowing: Initially a relatively cool section of parent material is exposed
to the hot cavity environment. The surface of the material increases
in temperature due to radiant heat transfer and heat is transferred
into the material by thermal conduction. The non-uniform heating of
the material causes thermal stresses to develop, and at sufficiently
weak points the stresses initiate the formation of cracks. With con-
tinued exposure to the hot environment, crack propagation occurs
until the cracks link up and the material fractures, causing a small
piece of material to break away (spall) from the parent material,
thereby exposing a relatively cool portion of material to the hot envi-
ronment and causing the process to begin again.

P3.3.1. Coal spalling

excavations and inspections which showed that substantial amounts

PThe uniform heating experiments showed that moisture was a
necessary condition for the occurrence of explosive spalling. Above a
critical heating rate of »2.5 °C/min air-dried silt-laminated shale
cores spalled explosively. The linear heating rate experiments

(a) oven-dried samples and (b) saturated samples (from Hettema [145]).

Pshowed that explosive spalling by steam pressure occurred in the
range 4(cid:1)8 MPa. At slow heating rates at temperatures up to 900 °C,
temperature alone does not lead to spalling or macroscopic fractur-
ing of rock.

PSpalling experiments performed on cubic rock samples under bi-
axial stress showed that temperature was the main factor in the
spalling behavior. Three regimes for the radiation temperature were
identified [145]:

T < 600 °C:
600 < T < 900 °C:
T > 900 °C:

neither spalling or fracturing occurs
rock fracturing occurs without spalling
spalling occurs

PFig. 14(a) and (b) shows the measured average spalling rates in
relation to the heat flux, qs/DTsp, for oven-dried and saturated rock
samples, respectively. Also shown on these figures are calculated
theoretical curves for a heat flux of qs 1⁄4 50; 000 W/m2, and varia-
tions in the volumetric water fraction, XL. Experimental spalling
rates were found to be consistently lower but reasonably in line
with the theoretical values based on the conservation of energy,
if the effects of clay bound water are taken into account [145]. The
calculated heat fluxes under spalling conditions varied from 35 to
64 kW/m2 with the oven-dried silt-laminated shale samples,
127(cid:1)227 kW/m2 for laminated sandstone and »127 kW/m2 for air-
dried shale-laminated siltstone samples. This range (cid:1) from »104 to
»105 W/m2 (cid:1) is well within the range of potential radiant heat
fluxes from the hot cavity (see Fig. 10).

PThermo-physical properties of coal and rock that are useful
in building UCG models are reported in Wolf and de Pater [152], Het-
tema [145] and Wolf and Hettema [153] and Wolf and Bruining
[154].

Pgasification. Tsang describes a model for coal block combustion [96],
and Massaquoi and Riggs developed a 1D numerical model of a dry-
ing and combusting wet coal slab and compared results to laboratory
combustion experiments of Texas lignites conducted at atmospheric

Ppressure [91,92]. Park and Edgar developed a model which
accounted for evaporation, pyrolysis and gasification of the char,
plus the development of an ash layer [138]. Under oxidizing condi-
tions the above models find that the coal conversion is controlled by
mass transfer [138].

PCoal block models enable the evolution of the detailed profiles
through the coal to be predicted. Modeling consistently shows that a
steady-state condition for coal block gasification is reached in about
3 h and that the length of the dry zone is only about 3 cm in length
[91,92,129]. These results are supported by laboratory experiments
(e.g. [103].) and field scale measurements (e.g. [104].). A typical set
of profiles through the dry coal zone once pseudo-steady-state has
been obtained, is shown in Fig. 15. The change in conversion Xc, due
to volatile matter at low temperatures and char gasification at high
temperatures is apparent.

PThe effects of operating conditions and coal properties on cavity
growth have been studied [47,88]. The sensitivity of the cavity
growth rate vc, to a change in model parameter p, was calculated by
a finite difference formulae where p0 represents the base value of
parameter p and Dp is a perturbation to the value of parameter p.
Table 12 shows the top five parameters with the highest sensitivity
of the cavity growth rate to operating conditions, while Table 13
shows the top five coal properties. Cavity growth rates are most
affected by temperature, the level of water influx from the wet coal
seam, the steam content in the gas and the pressure. The coal prop-
erties which most affect cavity growth rates are the thermo-
mechanical spalling behavior, the fraction of fixed carbon, the coal
density, ash content and ash layer thickness.

4. Phenomena in the permeable bed

PIt is envisaged that residual ash and spalled char and rock form a
permeable bed of material inside the developing UCG cavity in the
vicinity of the oxidant injection location. Bulk collapse of material
can also contribute to the permeable bed. The bed is referred to as
“permeable” since its material structure is not well defined - the
characteristic particle size may range from small particles generated
by spalling, chunks of material breaking off to large sections of the
sidewall and roof collapsing. The permeable bed is typically repre-
sented in models as a packed bed with a uniform particle size.

PGrens and Thorsness considered the effect of bed properties on
cavity growth [156], while Kang et al. developed a multi-dimen-
sional model of packed bed gasification relevant for underground
coal gasification [157]. Yang and co-workers have developed several
models for the fluid flow, heat transfer and reaction inside perme-
able beds relevant for UCG [111]. Dasappa and Paul analyze the gasi-
fication of char particles in a packed bed [158], while Peters has
classified the combustion regimes and simulated a packed bed as a
set of individual discrete and reacting particles [159,160]. Baggio
et al. outline some considerations for modeling heat and mass trans-
port in porous media [161]. In addition, there is a significant body of
literature of relevance to UCG, from which correlations of heat trans-
fer via conduction and convection, mass transfer, gas dispersion and
pressure drop have been developed using laboratory experiments
with packed beds (e.g. [162(cid:1)168].).

4.1. Transport phenomena

PInside the underground cavity, ash, char and rock pieces accumu-
late, forming a porous media, which is essentially stationary. Table 14
shows the main conservation equations for multi-phase flow and
reaction in the permeable bed.

PAlthough the flow leaving the injection well will be turbulent,
expansion into the cavity will cause a significant reduction in veloc-
ity over a short length scale (»1(cid:1)10 m) and potentially a transition

Pto laminar flow depending upon the temperature and pressure. The
interphase heat and mass transfer in the bed has been determined in
experiments. Fig. 16 shows the variation in Sherwood number with
Reynolds number for four correlations taken from the literature
[165,169]. Typical values of the Sherwood number in the permeable
bed of UCG are between 10 and 100. It can be seen there is a varia-
tion in the reported correlations by a factor of around two. In partic-
ular, the behavior of the correlations at low Reynolds numbers,
which corresponds to the regime of maximum temperature in a
counter-current packed bed, shows even greater deviation.

PIn the bed, chemical reactions may occur in the gas film sur-
rounding the particle, on the surface of the particle and inside the
pores of the particle. Various formulations for the combined chemi-
cal reaction and mass transport can be derived. While detailed pore
evolution and chemical reaction as presented for the sidewall may

Palso be applied in the permeable bed, simplified models of the
combined reaction and mass
transfer are usually assumed
[139,157,172,173]. From modeling of conventional packed bed gasif-
iers, Hobbs et al. recommend the shell progressive model wherein
the ash layer is allowed to build up around the particle, as opposed
to the ash segregation model in which the ash layer is assumed to
break away from the particle core [68]. The use of the shell progres-
sive model seems appropriate when considering the images of the
permeable bed from laboratory studies (e.g. [103].) and field excava-
tions (e.g. [104,105]).

4.2. Bed properties

PGenerally, the bed generated from spalled char, ash and roof rub-
ble is relatively permeable with significant porosity, eb, and with aver-
age particle sizes dp in the range of 0.2(cid:1)2 cm [104]. Britten and
Thorsness found that the permeability ratio of rock rubble to ash rub-
ble (Kr/Ka) has a significant impact on the cavity development once
the overburden rock had been exposed [174]. For cases in which the
rock was less permeable than the ash rubble, the injected oxygen
was forced to the coal sidewall where it generated heat and gasified
coal, producing a high calorific value product gas. When the rock rub-
ble was more permeable than the ash rubble, the oxygen would flow
preferentially into the void space and combust gasification products
generated at the sidewalls, leading to a poor quality gas [174].

4.3. Controlling phenomena in the permeable bed

PThe phenomena controlling the conversion of char to gaseous
products in the permeable bed may be either mass transfer or chem-
ical kinetics. Whereas, in the sidewall, some of the reactants may be
transported from within the coal block, in the permeable bed the
spalled char is likely to be fully pyrolyzed, implying that further con-
version requires reactants to be transported from the bulk gas to the
surface of the char particles.

PA simplified model for combined mass transfer and chemical
reaction of char particles in the permeable bed has been developed
to assess
the controlling phenomena. Two reactions using
apparent chemical kinetics from Hobbs et al. [68] are considered:

Paround each char particle. For the combustion reaction it can be
seen in Fig. 17(a), that ash diffusion is the limiting rate at tempera-
(cid:1)4Þ and chemical kinet-
tures higher than about 1400 °C (1=T < 6 (cid:5) 10
ics is limiting at temperatures below 1400 °C. The model confirms
the general expectation that the combustion process will be mass
transfer limited at the temperature levels that are likely to be pres-
ent inside the UCG cavity. In Fig. 17(b) it can be seen that gasification
is dominated by the chemical kinetics and only becomes mass trans-
fer limited at very high temperatures which are hard to sustain due
to the endothermic nature of the gasification reaction. However, if a
thick ash layer on the char particles developed, which is possible
based on excavations and laboratory photos (e.g. [103,104]), then
ash layer diffusion would become a rate limiting step assuming the
ash is not in a molten state. Modeling of the ash layer behavior will
often require simplifications as discussed in Section 3.2.1.

PThe simplified model for mass transfer and reaction shows that
when considering the rate limiting phenomena in the permeable
bed, the combustion reaction will likely be mass transfer controlled
and the gasification reactions will be kinetically controlled, which is
consistent with literature [44]. Thus it is recommended that both
mass transfer and chemical kinetics should be incorporated into the
modeling of the permeable bed. While a number of tools are avail-
able to model permeable and packed beds, computational fluid
dynamic simulators offer the ability to represent the complex three
dimensional shapes that have been observed in field excavations of
UCG projects.

4.4. Oxidant distribution and impact on cavity development

PIn practice the permeable bed is not one-dimensional nor homo-
geneous, but multi-dimensional and heterogeneous, and the distri-
bution of materials that occurs in the bed will impact on the flow of

Poxidant and hence on how the UCG cavity will develop over time.
Whether the coal seam is thick or thin will also influence the devel-
opment of the cavity. There is also an interaction of the coal and
over-burden roof with the development of the permeable bed [175].
Together with the rate controlling phenomena in the bed, and the
behavior of the coal and over-burden upon heating, these factors
will determine how the in situ cavity will evolve over time.

PThe behavior of the mineral matter in the coal during under-
ground gasification could control the development of the overall
process. Liu et al. have reported on investigations of the minerals
generated during experimental simulations of UCG under oxygen
blown conditions, with varying levels of oxygen in the oxidant [112].
The ratio of the permeability of the roof rubble to the ash (Kr/Ka) has
been found to be a key determinant in the development of the cavity
[174]. Fig. 18 shows interpretations of how the ratio of Kr/Ka could
affect the development of the cavity in a reasonably thick coal seam,
following the original analysis of Britten and Thorsness [174]. Here,
a “thick” coal seam is one being »5 m thick or more. If the value of
the ratio Kr/Ka (cid:6) 1, then the cavity will have a propensity to grow
upwards, as seen in Fig. 18(a), as any oxidant reaching the rubble,
will preferentially move through it and into the void space. If the
value of the ratio Kr/Ka (cid:7) 1, then the rubble will act as a barrier to
oxidant flow up and into the void space. In this situation, the oxidant
will preferentially distribute towards the sidewalls and into regions
with unconsolidated ash and char that build up towards the lateral
extremeties, as shown in Fig. 18(c). When the ratio of Kr/Ka»1, then
the cavity will develop rather uniformly upwards and outwards as
indicated in Fig. 18(b). Therefore, the parameter Kr/Ka has a signifi-
cant impact on the UCG process.

PFig. 19 shows a schematic of the potential development of the
cavity in a thin and spalling coal, with “thin” coal seams being those
< 5 m in thickness. Like in thick coals, the cavity will initially grow
upwards, forming an ash layer at the bottom of the cavity and a char
layer above the ash due to coal spalled from the roof. However, the
cavity will reach the over-burden roof rock very quickly, perhaps in
a few days, leading to the build up of rock rubble in the cavity due
either to rock spalling or due to slumping and bending of the overly-
ing strata. For an economically attractive process, further lateral
growth implies that oxidant is pushed to the sidewalls where its
combustion generates heat to drive the endothermic gasification of
the coal. Several models assume that the channel region can develop
at the periphery of the cavity and sustain the continued distribution
of oxidant to sidewall as the inner region of the cavity fills up with
roof rubble and becomes consolidated by over-burden layers col-
lapsing onto it. The Wilks conceptual model is an example of this
assumption [176] and has been used for the development of various
subsequent mathematical models for thin seams (e.g. van Batenburg
et al. [128]; Kuyper et al. [130,177]). However, given the generally
low volumes of coal converted to date in UCG projects conducted in
thin seams, it is not possible to verify this cavity development
assumption. There appears to be a high risk that the oxidant will
break through the inert roof rubble to the production well, leading

Pto low resource recovery and poor cold gas efficiencies. In thin
seams, if the coal conversion does not occur laterally to a significant
extent, then it will be challenging to achieve satisfactory project eco-
nomics.

4.5. Lateral extent

PThe lateral extent of cavity development is important since it
directly affects the cost of syngas produced as discussed in Part I
[30]. It is expected that the lateral extent of a cavity will depend on
numerous factors, such as oxygen injection rate, coal quality, coal
seam height, minimum acceptable syngas quality, operating pres-
sure, ratio of rock and ash permeabilities etc. An empirical rule of
thumb for the lateral width, W, of a UCG cavity is [30]:
W 1⁄4 h ¢ H;
where h is the cavity width factor with a value typically in the range
2 < h < 5. Eq. 11 is likely only valid for thin to moderately thick coals,
ie. H < »15 m. The Soviet projects produced low calorific value syn-
gas with air and with high resource recovery, generally yielding
»4 < h < »5. For example in the Moscow Basin the cavity width was
»20 m and the seam thickness was »4 m, giving h » 5 [178]. At the
short duration Hoe Creek II project, the cavity width was »16 m, giv-
ing h » 2 [179,180]. In the Hanna II, Phase II project 2124 tons of coal
were converted to gas leading to a cavity about 15 m wide in a 9 m
coal seam, giving h » 1.7 [180]. Demonstration projects aiming for
high cold gas efficiency and using oxygen blown gasification have
typically led to values of h between 2 and 3. In the Rocky Mountain I
project h » 2.4 [181,182] and in the Chinchilla Gasifier 5 project
»2 < h < »2.5.

ð11Þ

PWhile Eq. (11) could potentially be improved by incorporating
some of the physical phenomena controlling lateral cavity growth in
UCG, even better estimates can be made with numerical modeling
tools, such as those reviewed in Sections 5 and 8.

4.6. Permeable bed modeling

PThe early models of Winslow [166] and Thorseness [183] were
one-dimensional and assumed a highly permeable porous medium,
analogous to a moving bed coal gasifier, albeit with a stationary coal
bed which is consumed over time. Using their packed bed model,
Thorsness et al. [184] were able to make good predictions of gas
production, gas composition and coal consumption for laboratory
experiments with crushed coal for a feed gas with a steam to oxygen
ratio of 6:1. Thorseness and Kang [172,173] developed the first gen-
eral 2D packed bed gasification model and used it to investigate the
physics in cavity wall region. They conducted simulations to deter-
mine the conditions under which the production of char from the
wall layer by pyrolysis balanced the consumption of char in the bed

Table 16
Summary of significant underground coal gasification packed bed models.

Pdue to oxidation and gasification reactions. Thorsness and Kang
found that the char layer was found to be around 7.5 cm thick [172].
This cavity wall concept was first proposed by Grens and Thorse-
ness [156,185] and a simplified model of the phenomena was later
incorporated into the CAVSIM global UCG simulator [174]. Several
authors have adapted the packed bed modeling approach to repre-
sent the permeation theory of UCG (cid:1) for example Whitman and
co-workers [186,187] and Abdel-Hadi and Hsu [188]. Akkutlu and
Yortsos developed a dynamic model of the reaction fronts in
porous media [189]. Recently, Samdani et al. used a 1D plug flow
reactor model to represent the flow through char rubble in their
UCG simulator [139].

PTable 16 provides a summary of the most significant packed bed
models for UCG. It can be seen that most prior work has used a 1D
geometry and there is only one work assuming a multi-dimensional
bed. The discussion of the impact of oxidant distribution on the
development of the cavity and permeable bed in UCG indicates that
there is more work to do, to understand how the phenomena in
the permeable bed can impact on the overall performance of the
UCG process. Computational fluid dynamics simulation software
such as ANSYS FLUENT and multi-phase flow packages such as
MFIX are good candidates to use to simulate and explore the phe-
nomena in the permeable bed [190,191]. It is recommended that
modeling incorporate prediction of temperature and multi-compo-
nent mass transfer with chemical reactions in multi-dimensional
beds using geometries like those found in the excavations of UCG
(see Part I for some examples). Incorporating both mass transfer
and chemical kinetics for the main heterogeneous reactions is
required since the rate controlling step can switch between these
two phenomena.

5. Phenomena in the void space

PIn UCG, the existence of void spaces in the UCG cavity is guaran-
teed by virtue of the removal of coal atoms as syngas from the coal
seam. In the general depiction summarized in Part I, it is imagined
that the large void spaces exist between the spalled ash and char
permeable bed and the roof [30]. In practice the shape and connec-
tivity of the void spaces is likely to be more complex than shown in
the schematics. The void spaces play a significant role in determining
the syngas composition, by way of providing the residence time for
reaction, and also act as high permeability, paths of least resistance
for flow from the injection wells to the production wells.

(from Trevisan and Bejan [195]). While studies on the heat and mass
transport due to natural convection have been reported extensively
in the literature (e.g. [195(cid:1)200]), there are relatively few studies
concerned with double diffusive natural convection in which both
temperature and concentration gradients play a role in the transport
processes. Beizen performed natural convection experiments in a
trapezoidal enclosure, in an attempt to simulate the transport phe-
nomena occurring in the void space of a UCG cavity located above a
reacting porous medium [201]. This study showed that the heat and
mass transport in the cavity is transient. Van der Eyden performed
numerical simulations of a trapezoidal enclosure in which nitrogen
and argon were injected at different temperatures [202]. The simula-
tions were in general agreement with the measurements of Biezen
[201] and a hystersis effect was observed for the transition between
laminar and turbulent flow. In related work, van der Eyden et al.
showed that increasing gas injection in the cavity resulted in a tran-
sition from a temperature dominated natural convection flow to a
concentration dominated natural convection flow [202].
It was
found that in the temperature dominated regime, the flow structures
were turbulent and oscillating [202]. In the concentration dominated
regime, the flow structures were laminar, as the greater concentra-
tion of heavy gas species damped out turbulent fluctuations [202].
The hysteresis effect was also found within a certain range of operat-
ing conditions. Numerical studies in an anisotropic porous cavity in
which double diffusive natural convection was established, have
also found the existence of multi-solutions [203], and simulations of
the unsteady transport behavior under laminar and turbulent flow
regimes have also been reported [204].

PIn the double diffusive studies, the concentration of each species
is known at the wall boundaries. In UCG, the concentrations at the
sidewalls are not known a priori. Due to the chemical reaction of the
coal, the wall concentrations depend on both the transport phenom-
ena and chemical reaction rate. Kuyper developed a channel model
for UCG, which solved for the Navier(cid:1)Stokes equations and the k(cid:1)e
turbulence model, using a finite volume computer code, and also
included chemical reactions on an exposed coal wall [130]. This
study showed that the injected oxygen was consumed by volatile
species in the gas phase and did not directly react with the coal wall.
It was also shown that fluid flow and gasification processes in the
channel were time(cid:1)dependent, with the frequency of oscillation
related to the transport of CO(cid:1) and CO2(cid:1)bubbles in the channel
[130,205].

PIn summary, natural convection processes play a significant role
in underground coal gasification and must be included in fluid flow
models of the void space. In channel models where a detailed simu-
lation of forced and natural convection by way of computational
fluid dynamics may not be practical, simplified methods can be used
to model the effects of natural convection. Perkins [88] used an over-
all effective diffusivity, Deff, calculated as the sum of the molecular
diffusivity and the diffusivity representing the convection processes,

5.2. Radiant heat transfer

PRadiant heat transfer is important in the void spaces since tem-
peratures exceed 1000 K in most parts of the cavity, and may exceed
2000 K in the combustion zone. The main impact of radiant heat
transfer is to smooth out peak temperatures and provide a mecha-
nism for heat transfer over long distances in the underground cavity.
The presence of large void regions mean that radiant heat transfer is
important in determining the heat transport to exposed coal surfa-
ces, resulting in self- gasification of the coal or thermo-mechanical
failure due to the imposed heat fluxes. The heat flux to the char face
due to radiation is given by:

Þ;

1⁄4 FesðT 4
g

(cid:1)T 4

qrad
where F is a view factor, s is the Stefan(cid:1)Boltzman constant, Tg is the
temperature of the gas in the void and Tw is the temperature of
the char at the wall. The coal emissivity, e, is typically »0.85.

ð14Þ

PModeling of radiative heat transfer is complicated by the pres-
ence of gas species such as CO2 and H2O which emit and absorb radi-
ation, and hence interfere with the radiative transfer between the
walls of the gasifer [206]. The Rosseland model treats the radiation
heat transfer with an effective thermal conductivity and is only
applicable of optically thick media [190]. Various approximations of
the radiative transport equation have been developed, including the
P-1 radiation model, discrete transfer models and discrete ordinates
models [190]. The choice of radiation model is influenced by the
required accuracy and available computational resources. Given the
many uncertainties regarding the behavior of the coal in UCG and
the influence of the environment on the process, it is expected that
radiative heat exchange can be adequately represented by approxi-
mate models, such as the P(cid:1)1 model or discrete ordinates model
[207].

PKuyper developed a CFD model for the gasification of coal in a
channel formed in thin, deep coal seams [130]. Kuyper studied the
impact of the radiant properties of the gas on the fluid flow and dis-
tribution of syngas composition within the channel. Fig. 20 shows
calculations of the velocity vectors and CO mass fraction for the case
when the gas was modeled with radiant properties of k 1⁄4 0 m(cid:1)1 and
k 1⁄4 0:12 m(cid:1)1; respectively. When the gas interacted with radiant
heat exchange between the walls of the channel, the circulation pat-
terns were moderated and the concentration of CO in the channel
became more stratified.

PThe implication for UCG modeling is that radiation heat exchange
must be included and that the radiative properties of the synthesis
gas components, particularly CO2 and H2O, should be accounted for.

5.3. Mixing behavior

PThe size and connectedness of the void space will depend on a
variety of factors, including the bulking factors of the char, ash and
rock rubble in comparison to their respective virgin states; and
deformation of the coal seam and overburden due to the formation
of the cavity. An important question is whether the void space in
UCG is well mixed. If the void space is well mixed, it will behave like
a continuously stirred tank reactor; if it is not well mixed it could
behave like a plug flow reactor. The relative importance of convec-
tion and dispersion in a chemical reactor can be characterized by the
Peclet number (Pe), defined as:
Pe 1⁄4 ugL
Deff

ð15Þ

;

PThis approximation dramatically speeds up computational times,
since a steady-state form of the conservation equations can be
solved and a much coarser grid can be used because the details of
the flow field are not resolved.

in which Deff is the effective dispersion co-efficient, ug is a character-
istic velocity, and L represents the characteristic length scale of the
reactor [208]. A stirred tank reactor has Pe (cid:7) 1, while a plug flow
reactor has Pe (cid:6) 1.

(from Kuyper [130]).

PTests using deuterium in the Hoe Creek III test showed that
the tracer data could be reasonably well fitted using a stirred-
tank model [209]. More complex models such as a combined
stirred-tank and plug flow model and a parallel path plug flow
model led to improved fitting of the experimental data but also
involved more model parameters (cid:1) therefore it is not clear that
these models provided a better representation of the underlying
physics [209]. Tracer tests at the El Tremedal trial conducted in
Spain, indicated that the mixing processes in the gasifier behave
“like a small number of stirred tanks in series with a high level
of back mixing” [210].

PDaggupati et al. have investigated the fluid flow in UCG cavities
using computational fluid dynamics and compartment modeling
[211,212], with the aim of characterizing the mixing characteristics
and developing simplified models of combined mass transfer and
Isothermal experiments and CFD modeling

showed UCG cavities had non-ideal mixing behavior and Daggupati
et al. found that a compartment model with a main stream with 5
CSTRs and a bypass stream with 5 CSTRs and a PFR provided a good
match with the data [211]. Non-isothermal simulations confirmed
that the location of the combustion zone has a strong impact on the
flow behavior in the cavity and influences the mixing characteristics
[211]. Fig. 21 shows the impact of temperature and flow rate on the
RTDs.

PThe experimental and numerical work show that the flow charac-
teristics in UCG are non-ideal and also depend somewhat on the
spalling behavior of the coal. Therefore, to accurately represent the
fluid flow and mixing in UCG cavities, compartment or CFD models
should be used.

5.4. Impact of coal spalling

PEarly work with low rank spalling coals, assumed that the reac-
tion of the oxygen with the char will be most intense in the vicinity
of the interface between the ash and char bed layers in the perme-
able bed [150]. If the char layer becomes sufficiently thick due to

Fig. 21. Effect of (a) temperature and (b) flow rate on the residence time distributions

American Chemical Society).

Phigh rates of coal spalling, then the oxidant will be fully consumed
before entering the void space above. In this case a reducing zone is
formed in the void space and the hot char layer radiates to the
exposed cavity wall surfaces, causing coal drying and pyrolysis and
leading to dried coal being spalled onto the bed to replenish the char
layer [150,175]. However, if a hard coal with little or no propensity
to spall is being gasified, then it is expected that the oxidant will
enter into the void, leading to (some) combustion of the volatiles
emanating from the drying, pyrolysis and gasification of the coal
sidewalls and roof. The peak temperature in this case will likely
migrate towards the top of the cavity and drive faster roof growth
and lead to poor mixing of the void space [213].

PThe effect of spalling was considered by Daggupati et al. by per-
forming CFD and compartment simulations of the void space with
the following boundary conditions: i) high roof temperature, ii)
high floor temperature and iii) spalled particles on the floor at
high temperature [211,212]. High floor temperatures (due to com-
bustion of spalled char) led to greater mixing, while the compart-
ment flow modeling showed higher active volumes in the case of
spalling. Oxidant injected into a gasifier operating in this mode
would then have a greater probability of combusting the product
syngas and/or migrating towards the production well leading to
poor lateral growth rates and to eventual bypassing the reaction
zone. This behavior is often observed when the cavity roof reaches
the overburden, leading to a decline in syngas quality and process
efficiency.

5.5. Impact of combustion zone location

PThe location of the combustion zone will be influenced by the
development of the permeable bed, the distribution of permeability
in the bed and the behavior of coal spalling from the roof and side-
wall. Britten and Thorsness studied the impact of the ratio of
rock and ash permeability, Kr/Ka, on cavity development [174]. If
Kr/Ka > 1, then the injected oxidant migrates towards the rubble
zone and forms a combustion zone above the injection point. Fig. 22
(a) shows a schematic of this scenario. Since ash and rubble contain
little organic material, the oxidant will react with the volatile com-
ponents in the syngas, consuming CO, H2 and CH4 produced from
gasification reactions at the sidewall and roof of the cavity. The
higher temperatures towards the center of the cavity, will establish
natural convection flows predominately upwards above the injec-
tion point with a rotation outwards to the sidewall. Fig. 23 shows
computational fluid dynamic simulations of this scenario from Per-
kins and Sahajwalla [213]. Fig. 23(a) shows the geometry used, while
23(b) shows the velocity vectors and 23(c) shows contours of tem-
perature, respectively. The swirling motion of the fluid in the cavity
and the high temperatures due to combustion of some of the syngas
produced at the sidewall and roof are clearly visible.

PIf Kr/Ka < 1, then the injected oxidant is found to migrate out-
wards towards high permeability zones of char near the sidewall of
the cavity [174]. In this situation, the oxidant will combust and then
gasify char and volatile components, causing the highest tempera-
tures to be close to the sidewall [174]. This situation establishes
upwards close the sidewall of the void space and a rotation back
towards the center of the cavity, as shown in Fig. 22(b). An advan-
tage of this scenario is that lateral cavity growth is maximized and
the injected oxidant is used efficiently to gasify char pyrolyzed and
spalled from the sidewall, rather than combusting volatile syngas
products.

5.6. Channel models

PChannel models generally represent the UCG reactor as a one-
dimensional channel with the gasification reactions occurring on the

combustion zone: (a) combustion zone above the injection point in middle of cavity
and (b) combustion zones towards sidewall of cavity.

Pwall of the channel. An early channel model assumed that the gas-
ifier behaved as an expanding cylindrical cavity in the coal seam,
with forced convection mass transfer and reactions occurring on the
surface of the cavity walls [123]. Van Batenburg developed a 1D
model of a section of the longwall face and used it to predict the per-
formance of the Pricetown I gasifier [127,128]. The model assumes
that mass transport is dominated by natural convection in the chan-
nel. Debelle et al. modeled flow at the Thulin UCG test site [214].
Coeme et al. [215,216] developed a channel model, which assumed
chemical equilibrium at the coal wall and modeled mass transfer
using a correlation derived for forced convection over a packed bed
of spheres. Yang extended earlier models to incorporate a free chan-
nel and compared the results with laboratory measurements of coal
block gasification [109]. More recently, Seifi et al. developed a sim-
plified formulation of a channel model and solved the model using
an analytical approach [217]. Table 17 provides a summary of the
reported channel models.

5.7. Computational fluid dynamic modeling

PKuyper pioneered the application of CFD to underground coal
gasification, presenting some of the first research in which double
diffusive natural convection and chemical reaction on a wall were
studied numerically [130,177,205]. Kuyper used a finite volume
code with the k(cid:1)e turbulence model and focused on understanding
the transport phenomena in a channel during the gasification of thin
seams (<3 m thick) [130,176]. Kuyper found that the fluid flow was
dominated by either buoyancy due to temperature or concentration
gradients depending on the operating conditions. The double diffu-
sive natural convection processes were also found to cause periodic
generation and collapse of CO2 bubbles in the channel [130]. For the
cases investigated, mass transport was reported to be the rate limit-
ing step in the production of the valuable chemical species. Table 17
provides a summary of the CFD models.

PPerkins developed a two-dimensional CFD model assuming an
axi-symmetric cavity shape to enable simulation of thick coal seams,
generally recognized to be more suitable for exploitation via UCG
[88]. An axi-symmetric two-dimensional approximation was used
based on the expectation that Gr/Re2 (cid:6) 1. Several three dimensional
CFD based models have been developed by Liu, Luo, Chokendar,
Koning and Perkins. The first model was developed by Luo and co-
workers extended the geometrical approach of Schwarz et al. and

Pincorporated chemical reactions in both the gas phase and with the
char [221,222]. Liu developed a 3D CFD model using ANSYS-FLUENT
to interpret operational data from Gasifier 3, 4 and 5 at Chinchilla,
Australia [225,226]. The model extended the 2D work of Perkins to
3D and incorporated additional gas components, including O2, CO,
CO2, H2, H2O, CH4 and N2. The FLUENT wall reaction submodel was
used to model the heterogeneous coal reactions and coal volatile
data using the expressions from Hobbs et al. [68]. Fig. 24 shows the
schematic of the 3D model used to represent the first 3 months of
operation of Gasifier 5, with an assumed maximum cavity width of
16 m, cavity length of 30 m and cavity height of 5.5 m. The overall
volume for the UCG cavity is 1142 m3. Fig. 25 shows calculated
temperature profiles through the cavity and some velocity vectors.
It is seen that the injected oxygen reacts close to the injection
point leading to high temperatures, which due to buoyancy are
carried towards to the top of the cavity. Thus the simulation pre-
dicts that the cavity grows upwards and outwards around the
injection point, as has been observed in actual field trials. There is
very good mixing within the cavity as shown by the velocity vec-
tors and contours of the gaseous components (not shown) reveal
they are well mixed due to the high turbulence and buoyancy
driven flows in the cavity.

PLiu extended the model to incorporate multiple cavities, as may
exist during UCG gasification via the CRIP method [227,228]. Fig. 26
shows the geometries of a single and double cavity configuration
and shows the cavity growth rates on the external coal wall.

PChokendar, et al. evaluated the capability of the ANSYS-FLUENT
software to automate the generation of the cavity growth using
the dynamic mesh functions. This methodology started with a
drilled link and then calculated a series of steady-state CFD

Psolutions to evolve the cavity shape in time based on the combined
heat and mass transfer and chemical reactions occurring in the
UCG cavity. The wall movement at each time step is calculated
as DL 1⁄4 Dt ¢ vc. The major challenges encountered with this meth-
odology were that the cavity growth rates, vc, needed to be
very smooth, and the time steps Dt very small in order to avoid
introducing excessive skewness into the meshes. In addition, the
boundary layer close to the wall was not well resolved which
made achieving a smooth velocity profile difficult. While the basic
procedure worked it was neither robust nor fast. Eventually, it was
decided that the approach was not robust enough for day to day
modeling applications.

PMore recently, Chatterjee provided a brief review of computa-
tional fluid dynamic modeling [229] and Zogala and Janoszek
described a CFD model for a coal block gasification experimental rig
at the Central Mining Institute in Poland [224].

6. Phenomena in the near and far fields

PThe “near field” is a zone around the immediate cavity which is
impacted by the presence of the UCG process. The near field under-
goes chemical,
thermal, geo-mechanical and hydro-geological
impacts. The region of the near field is expected to extend between
tens of meters to hundreds of meters from the center of the UCG cav-
ity. The exact distance depends on site specific geology, project scale,
gasifier design and operational parameters.

PThe “far field” is the zone that extends indefinitely from beyond
the near field. The impact of UCG process on the far field should be
very low, with the phenomena of most interest being the transport
of fluids and the distribution of pressure. Obviously, the boundary
between the near field and far field is not well defined, but to an
order of magnitude the far field exists between hundreds and thou-
sands of meters from the cavity.

Pmass transfer of gases and liquids, evaporation and condensation,
sources and sinks of various components such as organic contami-
nants, the conduction and convection of heat from the cavity into
the formation and geo-mechanical impacts due to the presence of
the cavity on its surroundings.

6.1. Heat transfer into overburden

PThe mechanism of coal and over-burden spalling increases the
rate at which heat will be transferred upwards into the overburden
formations. The geo-mechanical impacts of the cavity on its sur-
rounding will also change the nature of the formation, inducing
cracks and fractures which increase the porosity and permeability
and which also impact on the heat transfer characteristics. The pres-
ence of a hot zone in the cavity can also lead to the establishment of
natural convective heat transfer between the cavity and the overly-
ing formations [230].

PMallett has presented summary results of the temperature pro-
files around the UCG cavity over a 24 month period from the Blood-
wood Creek Panel 1 UCG project, as shown in Fig. 28 [231].
Monitoring 12 m above the coal seam, showed that temperatures
exceeded 100 °C during gasification operations. In the vicinity of the
sidewall of the reactor, temperatures were lower than 70 °C after 24
months and there were no detectable impacts on temperature,
below the coal seam, at 60 m above the coal seam, or more than
50 m laterally from the main reaction zone. These results are consis-
tent with calculations and measurements from the Rocky Mountain
I demonstration project [232] and observations from the Chinchilla
Gasifier 5 project [226].

PJi’an et al. modeled the heat transfer from a hot UCG cavity to
overlying rock formations [233]. Zhao et al. developed a model of
the coupled hydro-thermal phenomena occurring in orebodies dur-
ing mineralization processes [234]. The model captured the effects
of double-diffusive natural convection, chemical reactions and mate-
rial deformation [234].

6.2. Heat transfer into coal seam

PYang developed a series of models for gas flow and reaction in a
solid porous media to represent various configurations for under-
ground coal gasification [109,111,235,236]. In this work, a two-
phase model of gas and solid phases was assumed and the model
solved for the conservation of mass, momentum and energy with

Fig. 26. Schematic of a 3D UCG cavity simulated with CFD with colors showing cavity
growth rate (m/d).

PFig. 27 shows a schematic of the near and far field regions in the
vicinity of an underground coal gasifier. Immediately, around the
cavity, there is a hot zone due to the exothermic nature of the com-
bustion reactions. The hot zone grows upwards more than outwards
due to natural convection and coal and rock spalling. The presence
of the hot zone generates two-phase flow regions in the vicinity of
the cavity, where gases and liquids interact. Heat transfer from the
hot cavity into the coal, leads to evaporation of moisture and the
pyrolysis of the coal, including the generation of organics such as
phenols, BTEXs and light gases. The removal of coal material, via gas-
ification reactions, leads to the creation of a rock-mass damage zone
around the cavity. The degree of rock-mass damage depends on vari-
ous factors such as the size of the cavity and the properties of the
coal, under, and over-burden formations. Rock-mass damage leads
to changes in the permeability and porosity of the formation materi-
als around the cavity, impacting on heat and mass transport pro-
cesses. The over-burden material above the cavity will have some
tendency to slump, while the under-burden will have a tendency to
heave, just like in conventional underground mining operations. The
near field is a particularly important region, especially for managing
the environmental impacts of the UCG process. In order to manage
these impacts an understanding of the transport of materials to/
from the reaction zones inside the hot cavity are required. Therefore,
in the near field, the important phenomena include the heat and

Pchemical reactions between the gas and solid. The work focused on
modeling the coal gasification process and simulating gas produc-
tion and temperature profiles in coal blocks. In one paper, Yang
modeled the temperature field in a large coal block and compared it
to experimental results [235]. Another paper focused on gasification
in an inclined coal seam [107], and in a separate paper Yang simu-
lated the dynamic two-stage technique as used in the long-tunnel
two-stage gasification method [236]. Yang also simulated the UCG
process in a coal block with a free channel (drilled permeable link)
[109] and the UCG process in a blind borehole configuration [237].

PFig. 29 shows the measured and simulated temperature profiles
in a laboratory gasification panel 70 h after ignition [235]. It can be
seen that the temperature gradients are steep with temperatures
dropping to below 100 °C within about 1 m of the hot gasification
zone. These results are also consistent with other simulation results
such as coal block modeling made by Perkins [60].

6.3. Mass transfer around coal gasification zone

PThe transport of contaminants in the gas and groundwater
around an underground coal gasifier is of practical interest but is

Palso a complicated process, involving multiple factors including
heat, stress, seepeage and physio-chemical reactions [238,239]. The
contaminants of interest include organics such as BTEX, poly aro-
matic hydrocarbons (PAHs), phenols and inorganic species such as
sodium, sulfate, bromide and ammonia. Measurements of contami-

PKnowing the initial concentration of the solute, C0, the ground-
water flow velocity, v, and the effective diffusion properties of the
solution (Deff, B), then Eq. 17 can be used to calculate the concen-
tration at any time and at any distance from where the solute is
introduced.

PDalton and Campbell investigated the impacts of groundwater
transport around a UCG cavity using laboratory experiments
designed to mimic the bed permeability and water flow rates
measured at the Hoe Creek site [248]. Fig. 30 shows calculated
solutions for the relative concentration of phenol as a function of
time and distance from a UCG cavity assuming the natural
groundwater flow, v, is zero and using the values for Kd

Deff found by Dalton and Campbell [248]. According to the calcu-
lated solutions, the concentrations reduce very quickly with dis-
tance from the cavity, with the zone of influence on the order of
meters. In time there is dispersion of the solute, however Eq. 17
ignores the affects of biological reactions which may break down
some of the components [244].

residues, that could leach inorganic contaminants into the ground-
water and which could in turn pose an environmental concern if

tions have ceased.

PThe inorganics of interest are ionic species including calcium,
sodium, sulfate, bicarbonate and metals such as aluminum, arsenic,
boron, iron, zinc, selenium, hydroxide and some radioactive species
such as uranium [238]. Recent laboratories studies by Strugu-
la(cid:1)Wilczek et al. found that the majority of the tested heavy metals
leached to a stronger degree from ash residues than chars [250]. The
metals eluted from gasification residues include Al, Mo, B, Se, Cr, Zn,
Pb, Ni, Co, and Fe and, to a lesser extent, Mn, Ti and Cu [251].

PGroundwater studies from several UCG projects provide detailed
water quality sampling over time from around the post-gasification
site (e.g. Rocky Mountain I [252(cid:1)256]). Investigations conclude
that the risk posed by the inorganics depend heavily on post-
gasification ground water flows, which in turn are affected by spe-
cific site conditions [238].

6.5. Adsorption in coal

PMorgan studied the adsorption of organics in coal using samples
from the Hanna sub-bituminous coal seam in Wyoming [257]. Teng
and Hsieh studied the adsorptive capacity of activated carbon
derived from Mount Thorley bituminous coal using a phenol solution
[258]. Xu et al. investigated the sorptive properties of semi-coke
samples of Hebi coal [259]. Table 19 shows a summary of the adsorp-
tive capacity of various materials for phenol, which ranges from
about 1(cid:1)100 mg/g adsorbent.

PThe adsorptive capacities can be described by equilibrium iso-
therm models. The two most well known, are the Freundlich and the
Langmuir isotherm. The Freundlich model is given by:

where qe is the equilibrium adsorptive capacity and qm is the adsorp-
tive capacity per unit mass of adsorbent corresponding to complete
coverage of the adsorptive sites [258]. Table 20 shows the parame-
ters for the Freundlich and Langmuir isotherm models fitted from
phenol adsorption experiments using a variety of materials, includ-
ing coal, activated char and oxidated carbon. Morgan found that the
adsorptive capacity, arranged from low to high was: coal < char <
activated char < ash [257]. Morgan also investigated the adsorptive
properties of these materials using non-phenolic total organic car-
bon (TOC), o-cresol and p+m cresol [257]. Humenick and Mattox
report Freundlich isotherms for burn cavity waters (with and with-
out condensate) for lignite and clay materials [243].

PThe mass transfer and adsorption phenomena of coal, char and
ash show that the organic compounds that are of concern for
groundwater contamination do not travel far from the UCG cavities
and are preferentially adsorbed onto the coal’s surface. In situ field
monitoring from a number of UCG demonstrations confirm this
general conclusion [240(cid:1)242,256].

6.6. Contaminant transport modeling

PGarner and McTernan used a Monte Carlo method to determine
the probability of contamination in underground coal gasification
[260]. Beath et al. calculated contaminant distributions for salinity
and benzene in the vicinity of a proposed UCG project in the Surat
Basin, Queensland, using a numerical model [142]. Salinity increases

Pwere less than 100 mg/L within 100 m of the cavity with the radius
of influence decreasing after gasification operations ceased. Calcula-
tions of the benzene distribution were conservative, ignoring the
impact of adsorption and reaction. Under these conservative
assumptions, 100 years after gasification, the zone of influence based
on a trigger value of 1 mg/L was less than 300 m [142]. Mallett has
summarized the environmental performance of the Bloodwood
Creek UCG project in Australia, and provides a detailed discussion of
gas and groundwater interactions and their impact on migration of
contaminants [261,262].

PYang and Zhang developed a model of contaminant transport in
the vicinity of UCG and used it to simulate the phenomena around
the No. 2 Shaft at the Xinhe Mine in Xuzhou, China [239]. The model
employed a liquid phase, a vapor phase, groundwater temperature
and solid temperature, using equations similar to those in Table 14.
Contaminant concentration was represented by the sum of phenol
and CN(cid:1) and NHþ; with the initial concentration of 0.211 mg/L and
a source concentration value of 18.25 mg/L [239]. Fig. 32 shows the
measured and simulated temperature fields at 20 months after the
end of gasification operations.

PSoukup et al. characterized gas transport through samples taken
from around the gasifier in the “Barabara” mine in Poland [263] and
also modeled solute transport in the vicinity of the gasifier [264].
It was found that the structural characteristics (porosity, pore
diameter and tortuosity) play a major role in the overall permeation
transport of gaseous contaminants compared with the physical
characteristics such as pressure and temperature. The modeling
study investigated propagation rates of contaminants through five
aquifers (clay, silt, loam, sand and gravel) and found that the key
liquid transport parameters are the hydraulic conductivity, soil total
porosity and concentration of organic carbon in soil [264]. In general,
compared with gaseous transport, liquid transport is significantly
slower [264].

7. Geomechanical phenomena

7.2. Thermo-mechanical properties of rock and coal

PThe UCG process removes material from the coal seam via chemi-
cal reactions and in a manner analogous to a coal mine. As in under-
ground coal mining (UCM), this removal of material has impacts on
the under- and over-burden formations which surround and contain
the coal. The main differences between the UCG and UCM are: i) in
UCG high temperatures, pressure and reducing gases are present;
ii) in UCM ambient temperature, pressure and air are present; iii)
UCG cavities are relatively thin, being on the order of several tens of
meters, while in UCM long-wall faces of several hundred meters are
possible; iv) there is no opportunity to install supporting structures
in UCG as is common practice in UCM to keep access paths open for
equipment and personnel. Because of the long experience modeling
the surface and sub-surface subsidence in UCM, the existing techni-
ques have been used to estimate the geomechanical performance of
UCG. Geomechanical modeling enables prediction of the stress and
deformation of formation materials, the subsidence at surface and
the stability of the UCG cavities. When coupled with thermo-
hydraulic models, forecasts can be made of the impacts on transport
phenomena such as groundwater flows in the vicinity of the cavities.

PA knowledge of the mechanical behavior and properties of rocks
at high temperatures is necessary in order to establish the heat
transfer rates and mechanisms into the overburden. Wolf et al. con-
sidered the chemical and petrophysical properties of coal and rock
[152]. Wolf and Hettema studied the thermo-mechanical behavior
of rock from the El Tremedal UCG site [153]. Hettema performed lab-
oratory studies of the spalling characteristic of overburden rocks
[145], while Baker considered spalling and bi-axial stresses in the
overburden [151] and Akbarzareh and Chalaturnyk reviewed struc-
tural changes in coal at elevated temperature [269]. Ji’an measured
the mechanical properties of mudstones subjected to temperature
[270]. Recently Otto et al. considered the importance of tempera-
ture-dependent rock properties on modeling the thermo-mechani-
cal behavior of the strata surrounding a UCG cavity [230,271]. The
common conclusion from the work is that the behavior of sedimen-
tary rocks is largely governed by the heating rate, the in-situ stress
state and the absolute temperature, but the failure mechanism is
dependent upon the detailed properties of the micro-structure of
the material.

7.1. Basic principles

PThere are four distinct modes of geomechanical failure: stoping
or bulking subsidence, chimneying, bending subsidence and plug
failure [265]. Stoping or bulking subsidence occurs due to the pro-
gressive spalling of the roof coal and rock in brittle materials. Such
materials have a tendency to form an arch, however when the cav-
ity reaches a sufficient size that it cannot support the full weight of
overburden, forming a fracture zone from which some material fails
and falls into the cavity [265]. Chimneying starts over a relatively
small area due to progressive caving of material, but its impacts
are restricted to very shallow lying coal seams [266,267]. Bending
subsidence results when the overburden bends and sags into the
developing underground cavity and above a critical span size, dis-
placement may be observed at surface [13,265]. Generally, the sur-
face impact depends on the ratio of the lateral extent of the mined
area to the depth of the coal seam; forming subcritical, critical and
supercritical stages which are discussed in detailed by Gregg [265]
and shown in Fig. 33. A common profile for the vertical displace-
ment, S(x), is [265]:

1(cid:1)tanh

ð21Þ

(cid:10)
;

(cid:3)

(cid:4)

where S max is the maximum vertical displacement. Lastly, plug fail-
ure, involves a sudden failure and lowering of an unsupported span
of material and occurs weakly consolidated sediments.

PThe intact rock properties are generally measured using small
samples such as cores retrieved from exploratory drilling, which are
free from discontinuities such as joints and bedding planes. The in
situ rockmass properties are lower than those measured due to the
presence of the discontinuities, often at scales larger than the cores
from which measurements were made. The in situ rock mass proper-
ties are estimated from the measured values using failure criterion,
such as the Hoek-Brown criterion, defined by the equation [272]:

shows mechanical properties for rock and coal determined using
this methodology for the Wyodak coal seam located in the Power
River Basin, Wyoming, USA. The rock mass properties in this particu-
lar example are in the range of 10 to 30% of the measured intact
properties of small samples.

7.3. Pillar design

PWhen considering a UCG project with multiple injection-produc-
tion well pairs, the spacing and layout of the coal conversion/extrac-
tion becomes an important consideration. Having large coal pillars
increases stability at the expense of resource recovery. Kazak and
Kapralov outline a method to design pillars applied to a UCG project
in a steeply dipping coal seam in the South Abinsk area of Russia
[275,276]. Recently, Najafi et al. developed a calculational method to
estimate the width of protection pillars in the design of a multi-well
layout of CRIP gasifers and verified the method using numerical sim-
ulations with the FLAC3D computer code [268]. Fig. 34 shows the
side view of the configuration studied by Najafi et al. [268]. The pillar
strength, sp, is calculated using:

PThe development, side and front loads on the pillar are functions

and density [268]. As such, given a set of geological properties and
the geometrical and operational parameters for the gasifier layout,
Eq. 25 can be used to estimate the safety factor for the design.

7.4. Sub-surface geomechanical impacts

PSince the UCG process disturbs and removes a significant fraction
of the coal seam, the geomechanical impacts of the process are of
interest. In this sense UCG is similar to a mining process, whereby
large volumes of coal are removed from the underground resource.
However, unlike mining, there are no people underground and so
the modeling interest is more on how the removal of the coal will
impact sub-surface and surface subsidence and what the environ-
mental impacts could be.

PAdvani et al. conducted some of the earliest studies on the ther-
mal and structural responses in bituminous coal seams being consid-
ered for underground coal gasification [277,278]. They concluded
that existing primitive stress and thermally-induced stresses played
a major role in advancing UCG processes [277].

PFig. 35 shows an example of the simulated yield state of materials
surrounding a UCG cavity for a proposed project in the Wyodak coal
of the Power River Basin, Wyoming, USA. The coal is sub-bituminous
with a thickness of 10 m at a depth of circa 300 m. The rock mass
properties are the same as those provided in Table 21. In this case,

Pthe presence of the cavity, led to failure of the coal in the local vicin-
ity and movement up to 0.33 m, tension and shear failure up to
3.3 m into the overlying shale formation with no subsidence and no
impact on the confining sandstone above the shale and unconsoli-
dated sand layers.

7.5. Subsidence modeling

PMeasurements of surface subsidence from several UCG field dem-
onstration projects are available. Maximum vertical displacement at
Soviet projects which used the LVW concept and targeted high
resource extraction were generally in the range of 0.5(cid:1)1.0 m [279].
Avasthi and Harloff report that the surface subsidence at the Rawlins
I demonstration project was negligible [280], while the Hoe Creek III
demonstration developed a substantial surface crater, because the
chosen site as very shallow (»40 m), had weak and wet over-burden
material and the operations were conducted in a lower coal seam
with minimal separation from an upper seam [281(cid:1)283]. The learn-
ings from the earlier UCG projects have been incorporated into
recent projects. Demonstrations of the LVW, L-CRIP and P-CRIP
methods at the Chinchilla and Bloodwood Creek projects in the Surat
Basin of Australia have reported no significant surface impacts
[226,284,285]. Deep projects such as that at Thulin and Swan Hills
have also reported no surface subsidence [286(cid:1)289].

PEstimates of surface subsidence for future projects can be made
using analytical and numerical geomechanical models. Avasthi and
Harloff developed an empirical fit to the subsidence data from
underground mining, and also considered the surface subsidence
associated with single and multiple UCG cavities [280]. Trent and
Langland developed finite difference and finite element numerical
the subsidence in UCG [290]. Agapito Associates

underground coal gasification project in the Wyodak coal seam
would be less than 1 mm [274]. Yang et al. used an ABAQUS model
to calculate that surface subsidence within a few days of the ignition
of a UCG project in Bulgaria would be negligible (circa 0.1 mm)
[291]. Akbarzareh and Chalaturnyk calculated surface subsidence
induced from a UCG project conducted in a coal seam located
1400 m deep using a sequentially coupled thermo-hydraulic geome-
chanical model [292]. Maximum vertical displacement was esti-
mated at 0.04 m [292]. Li et al. developed a FLAC model of UCG and
underground mining and concluded that the subsidence behavior in
UCG is similar to UCM [293]. On the basis of that conclusion, Li et al.
adapted an analytical model for predicting surface subsidence in
UCM for use in UCG [293]. Calculations of the surface subsidence for
a project in China varied from 0.03 m to 0.17 m depending upon the
excavation scheme [293].

PThe aforementioned numerical studies generally show that UCG
has limited impact on the surface, however most studies are for
small demonstration scale projects operated for short periods of
time. There remains a need to undertake geomechanical modeling of
the entire UCG field development (which could involve hundreds of
wells) over several decades, to estimate the impacts of a commercial
UCG project.

7.6. Thermo-mechanical modeling

PWhile subsidence modeling may be undertaken using isothermal
models, the high temperatures generated by UCG and the changes in
thermo-physical properties of coal and rock that these temperatures
induce mean that a complete description, especially of near-field
phenomena, requires thermo-mechanical modeling. Advani and co-
workers developed a series of thermo-mechanical and geo-mechani-
cal models for application to estimating the boundaries of UCG cavi-
ties [278]. Ji’an et al. used a heat conduction model to estimate the
temperature field in the overburden above underground coal gasifi-
cation [233]. Akbahzadeh [269] has reviewed the structural changes
in coal relevant for underground coal gasification.

PWhile the thermo-hydraulic transport equations and the geome-
chanical equations may be solved simultaneously using a single
computer code, they are more commonly solved by separate soft-
ware and a coupling between the codes is established to solve both
sets of equations. Rutqvist et al. describe a method of coupling the

PTOUGH2 code with the FLAC3D code to solve multiphase flow, heat
transfer and deformation in fractured rock [294]. Minkoff et al. used
the IPARS reservoir simulator and the JAS3D mechanical finite ele-
ment code to simulate several oil production scenarios [295]. Li
describes application of EXOTHERM and FLAC compute codes to sim-
ulate problems of relevance in oil sands [296(cid:1)298]. Yang developed
a code to solve the temperature and stress field in underground coal
gasification [299]. Seifi et al. report on using the STARS reservoir
simulator to simulate the Thulin underground gasification demon-
stration [300]. Akbarzareh and Chalaturnyk describe iteratively cou-
pling STARS and FLAC3D [292,301]. In the coupling process, as
shown in Fig. 36, at each iteration the temperature, T, and pressure,
P, from the thermo-hydraulic code is transferred to the mechanical
code. The resulting effective stress, s0, and volumetric strain, ɛv, are
used to update the porosity, f, and permeability, K, fields, using: f 1⁄4

and geothermal reservoirs, which eliminates the convergence diffi-
culties of the iteratively coupled procedure [302,303].

Þexpð(cid:1)evÞ; and K 1⁄4 K0

PIn a recent study, Otto and Kempa have concluded that the tem-
perature-dependent thermo-mechanical properties which have a
notable direct influence on stress changes and deformation are the
elastic modulus, tensile strength and linear thermal expansion coef-
ficient, while thermal conductivity mainly influences the spatial
temperature distribution around the UCG reactor, and thus only
indirectly affects stress changes and deformation [230,271]. Fig. 37
shows simulations of the temperature field around a UCG reactor
using temperature-dependent and temperature-independent prop-
erties [271]. They also found that permeability changes calculated
based on volumetric strain showed negligible differences between
simulations using temperature-dependent and temperature-inde-
pendent parameters [271]. Otto et al. constructed a regional scale
thermo-mechanical model of UCG and studied the impact of a fault
[304].

PNaka et al. conducted coupled heat transfer and stress analysis on
a small-scale UCG model test to estimate the stress state in a high
rank crushed coal specimen [121]. They identified three regions:-

PA: thermal expansion as temperature increased from 20 to 430 oC

PIt was concluded that the initiation of radial cracks observed in
the model test was due to tensile stresses induced by thermal con-
traction in region C and that the propagation of the cracks was
halted in regions A and B which experienced compressive stress at
lower temperatures, as shown in Fig. 38 [121]. The radial cracks
were observed to align well with the direction of principal stress cal-
culated with the model.

8. Integrated UCG modeling

PIntegrated UCG models aim to describe the most important
aspects of the entire UCG process with a focus on syngas production
rate and composition, coal conversion rates and cavity shape. In this
section efforts on integrated UCG modeling are reviewed and recom-
mendations are provided on future UCG model development.

8.1. Resource recovery modeling

PResource recovery models are a class of integrated models which
apply sub-models to represent different regions or phenomena in
the UCG process. Often these models will explicitly track moving
boundaries which represent the delineation of one zone from
another. Table 22 shows a summary of the significant UCG resource
recovery models.

PThe CAVSIM model was developed by Britten and Thorsness at
the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory [174,311]. The model is
based on a few key assumptions — that cavity roof growth occurs
due to thermo-mechanical failure, that a packed bed of char forms
over the injection well, that the cavity is axi-symmetric and that an
outflow channel full of dried and pyrolyzed coal char links the
main cavity and the production well. Many of the submodels incor-
porated into the main model, have been reported separately
[150,172,174,175,192,311(cid:1)313]. Britten and Thorsness used CAV-
SIM to simulate the Partial Seam CRIP test [104,314,315] (see
Fig. 39) and the Rocky Mountain I field test [181,182,316,317] (see
Table 23) with considerable success. The main limitation of the

Pmodel is its axi-symmetric assumption and its focus on flat lying,
thick sub-bitumonous coals.

PBiezen developed an integrated resource recovery model using a
3D computational domain, porous medium approach and relations
for permeable bed and channel surface gasification together with
thermo-mechanical failure of both coal and rock [201,318,319]. A
probabilistic method was used to solve the flow equations and the
model was used to simulate a range of UCG scenarios in thin seams.
PNitao, Camp and co-workers developed an integrated 3D
resource recovery model for UCG [308,309]. This simulator is called
UCG-SIM3D and aims to be a “full scope” UCG simulator enabling
the full range of engineering decisions to be made regarding UCG,
including: i) site selection, ii) wells and module geometry, iii) injec-
tion rates and composition of the oxidant, iv) location and extraction
rates of groundwater pumping wells and v) environmental monitor-
ing plan [308]. The integrated simulator represents all the important
zones in UCG as shown in Fig. 40. UCG-SIM3D removes many of the
limitations of the earlier CAVSIM model and holds promise in being
able to model complex multi-well UCG configurations. Nitao has
reported validation of the model using the Hoe Creek III field trial
[308].

PSamdani and co-workers have developed a dynamic process
model using MATLAB that simulates the roof zone, the void, the rub-
ble zone and the outflow channel [139,310]. The roof is modeled as a
1D coal block, the void is assumed to be perfectly well mixed, the
rubble zone is modeled as a plug flow reactor and the outflow chan-
nel is modeled with a compartment approach. Comparison of the
model outputs with micro-UCG experiments and several field trials
shows reasonable agreement for the syngas heating value and com-
position [139,310].

8.2. Reservoir modeling

PReservoir models aim to forecast coal conversion and syngas pro-
duction using a set of equations on a continuum. These models

gas model, thermal-hydrological model and geomechanical model in the integrated
3D UCG simulator of LLNL (from Niato et al. [308]).

Passume a number of phases in each control volume of the model (e.g.
gas, water, oil, coal/rock) and apply the concept of a representative
elemental volume (see Fig. 3) to derive the multi-phase conservation
equations (see Table 5). Only a small number of reservoir simulators
have the capability to model multiphase systems with both the
energy equation and chemical reactions which is necessary for an
accurate simulation of UCG. The STARS software from CMG is com-
monly used for simulating thermal oil recovery, including in situ
combustion, which has a lot in common with UCG [86]. The ECLIPSE
software from Schlumberger and the GPRS simulator developed at
Stanford University provide similar capability [320(cid:1)322]. In the res-
ervoir models the volume fraction, fb, of each phase b is calculated
in each cell at each time step and thus can be used to track the loca-
tion of the coal walls when modeling UCG.

PSeifi et al. developed a 3D reservoir model for UCG using the CMG
STARS software and simulated a deep, low moisture, low ash coal
representative of those in the Western Sedimentary Basin of Canada
[323(cid:1)325]. A coal seam with dimensions of 25 m length, 12.5 m
width and 9 m height was simulated using grid blocks of 0.25 m £
0.25 m £ 0.25 m in size [323]. While the grid block size is small in
relation to typical values used for reservoir simulation applications,
it is large when attempting to resolve the interplay of the drying,
pyrolysis and gasification fronts of a coal block. Fig. 41 shows results
from the model after 50 days of simulation. The general form of the
cavities in terms of shape and the formation of various zones
throughout the coal seam for gasification, combustion, pyrolysis and
drying appear to be qualitatively reasonable. The model predicts
fairly large pyrolysis and drying zones, which may be an artifact of
the relatively large grid block sizes. Results of the gas rates of various
species were presented, though they were not compared with any
field trial data. Temperature profiles along the gasifier reported by
Seifi et al. [323] seem to be reasonable, reaching peaks of approxi-
mately 1200 °C.

PIn later work, Seifi et al. compared simulation results from the L-
CRIP and P-CRIP configurations and concluded that the P-CRIP con-
figuration does not increase the volumetric sweep efficiency above
the L-CRIP configuration [300]. Fig. 42 shows contours of tempera-
ture for the L-CRIP and P-CRIP configurations from Seifi et al. [300].
While the model captures most of the physico-chemical phenomena

Pin UCG, the simulations should be run for longer periods of time with
multiple CRIP retractions to better quantify the volumetric sweep
efficiency for each configuration.

8.3. Recommendations for UCG model development

PWhile there are many areas for future work, the recommenda-
tions here focus on the development of modeling tools which could
be used to simulate and optimize the performance of multiple well
UCG projects. Such tools, should be able to forecast the rate of coal
conversion from complex well configurations in 3D, the production
and composition of the syngas, the environmental impacts of hydro-
carbon liquids and gases and the geo-mechanical impacts of the UCG
process.

P8.3.1. Simulation platforms

PTable 24 shows some of the most promising software platforms

for developing UCG models in each class.

PCFD simulators can be best applied to study the interaction of the
heat and mass transport and chemical reactions within the void
space, within the permeable bed and on the cavity walls. The learn-
ings from CFD simulations can be used to inform how mixing pro-
cesses are modeled in the simpler process models and how
transport and reaction may be best represented in reservoir simula-
tors. Based on this review, CFD simulations should include models
for radiative heat transfer and chemical kinetics for both homoge-
neous and heterogeneous reactions as the rate limiting step could be
either mass transfer, heat transfer or chemical kinetics. It is recom-
mended that heterogeneous reaction rates use an effectiveness fac-
tor to represent the impacts of pore diffusion. Simulation of the
complex reacting flows within three dimensional representations of
UCG cavities would provide valuable insights into the processes in
UCG.

PThe development of specific UCG models in oil and gas reservoir
simulation tools such STARS and ECLIPSE should be explored more
fully. The tools could potentially simulate all of the important phe-
nomena in UCG simultaneously, including process performance such
as coal consumption, gas production, cavity shapes and environmen-
tal
impacts, such dispersion of contaminants, subsidence and
groundwater changes in pressure and composition. The modeling of
complex well designs and operating methodologies is also possible
enabling the optimization of the conversion of coal into gas at the
field scale while accounting for complex geological features such as
faults. The MRST toolbox developed by SINTEF which is an open
source simulator for rapid prototyping also holds promise, however
it is not yet capable of simulating thermally reacting flows [326].

PA major advantage of the reservoir simulators is that they can be
coupled to geo-mechanical models as shown in Fig. 36 to predict
how the extraction of coal as gas impacts on the near-field perme-
ability and hence the transport of gasification products from the
UCG cavities. These coupled simulations will likely be important in
providing confidence to regulators that the proposed UCG design
and operating envelope can adequately manage the environmental
impacts. Simulations of the near-field and far-field can also be

P8.3.2. Upscaling chemical kinetics

PA challenge with using reservoir simulation tools is the need to
upscale the chemical kinetics in reacting flows due to the very fast
rate of reaction compared to convective fluid flow [322,327]. The
Damk€ohler number (Da) expresses the ratio of residence time for
the convective fluid flow to the chemical reaction rate, Da 1⁄4 tres
1⁄4
tchem
_v ¢ L
r ¢ u [328]. In laboratory combustion tube tests Da » 103, while under
actual reservoir conditions Da » 107. The kinetic parameters used in
reaction models are derived from fits to laboratory combustion tube
experiments. While it is feasible to use very small grid block sizes of
(cid:1)2 m to model laboratory scale experiments, under actual
» 10
reservoir conditions grid block sizes are necessarily much larger,
typically with a length scale of » 100 (cid:1)102 m. Unfortunately, the
kinetic parameters and the predictions forecast from kinetic models
are sensitive to the size of the grid blocks used, requiring the devel-
opment of a robust upscaling methodology.

(cid:1)3 (cid:1)10

PPrior work has been focused on oil combustion: Marjerrison and
Fassihi [329] developed a procedure which modified the kinetics
obtained from combustion tube runs and combined the cracking and
combustion reactions into a new pseudo-reaction in an effort to
avoid unphysical “coking up” in field simulations. Kovscek and co-
workers have developed a procedure for upscaling of reaction kinet-
ics for in situ combustion of heavy oils called Work-flow-based
Upscaling-for Grid-Independence (WUGI) [322,327,330].

PWhile Seifi et al. proposed a methodology to convert intrinsic
reaction kinetic parameters for UCG into those suitable for use in
reservoir simulators the approach does not consider upscaling of the
kinetics [324]. For UCG, Perkins [88] developed a 0D model for cavity
growth and compared its results with a 1D model of coal block gasi-
fication. The 0D model has been used within a channel model but
has not been adapted for use within a reservoir simulator. A work-
flow similar to WUGI could be developed for coal gasification appli-
cations.

P8.3.3. Experimental data sets for model validation

PThere is a need for better designed and documented experimen-
tal data sets in order to enable UCG models to be validated and to
develop deeper insights into the site, design and operational factors
which differentiate a successful UCG project. There are many needs,
including the need to design common experiments and apply them
to different coals; perform experiments at different scales with the
same coal; develop common reporting methods for field demonstra-
tions and to develop multi-scale modeling approaches that repre-
sent the coal gasification process from the pore scale to the block
scale. To validate resource recovery and reservoir models, data sets
should include as a minimum, dynamic data from pilot and demon-
stration projects that include mass and energy balances for all
phases. Ideally pre- and post-gasification data at the site as well as
data collected during operations such as temperatures, pressures,
site and regional gas and water quality, along with post-gasification
coring and monitoring results. It is well known that determining
mass and energy balances for UCG demonstration projects is difficult
[331]. The establishment of joint academic and industry projects
would be very beneficial to aid in the development of common
methods and procedures and providing well documented data sets
for model validation.

P8.3.4. Optimization of field development

PIntegrated UCG models can help answer many outstanding ques-
tions in UCG. For example, how do L-CRIP, P-CRIP and Soviet-era
stream methods compare when applied at the field scale? While
recent L-CRIP and P-CRIP demonstrations have converted over
10,000 tons of coal into syngas, commercial gasifiers are expected to

Pconvert several hundred thousand tons of coal to syngas in the vicin-
ity of each injection-production well pair. There is very little pub-
lished work investigating the trade-offs that are expected in
commercial development between high efficiency, high resource
recovery and managing acceptable environmental impacts such as
subsidence and contaminant transport. Only integrated UCG models
offer the capability to model all of these aspects simultaneously and
are therefore going to be critical to both optimizing the coal conver-
sion in UCG and providing confidence in the environmental impacts
of large field developments.

9. Conclusions

PThis paper has provided a comprehensive review of all the funda-
mental physics occurring in underground coal gasification. The rele-
vant fundamentals of coal gasification have been described and the
phenomena of cavity growth at the sidewall and roof of the under-
ground cavity have been examined in detail. The phenomena of
mass transfer, heat transfer and chemical reaction have been sum-
marized and the controlling physics have been identified under vari-
ous conditions. The transport phenomena and chemical reactions
occurring in the permeable bed of char and ash and the void space
have been reviewed. The impact of the permeability ratio of rock
rubble and ash on distribution of the oxidant and on cavity growth
has been discussed and the various classes of UCG models have been
reviewed. The transport of heat and mass, including contaminants,
in the near- and far-fields surrounding an underground coal gasifier
have been summarized along with experimental and numerical
results. The geomechanical phenomena and the coupled interactions
between heat and mass transport and mechanical phenomena have
also been reviewed. Integrated UCG models have been reviewed and
recommendations for future model development have been pro-
vided.
