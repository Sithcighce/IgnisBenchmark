    "question_text": "Calculate the characteristic time for pore diffusion in a coal char particle during CO2 gasification at 1200 K, given a mean pore diameter of 10 nm and a tortuosity of 2.5. Use typical values for porosity (0.5) and diffusion length (0.1 mm) based on the paper's discussion of pore structure and mass transport in coal chars. Assume Knudsen diffusion dominates. Then, using the provided paper citations, explain how pore diffusion affects the effective reactivity of char in underground coal gasification without making unsupported claims about reaction time comparisons.",
    "standard_answer": "To calculate the characteristic pore diffusion time, we use τ_diff = L²/D_eff, where L is the diffusion length and D_eff is the effective diffusivity. For Knudsen diffusion, D_K = (d_pore/3) * √(8RT/(πM)), with d_pore = 10 nm = 1e-8 m, R = 8.314 J/mol·K, T = 1200 K, and M for CO2 = 0.044 kg/mol. First, compute the mean molecular speed: √(8*8.314*1200/(π*0.044)) = √(79872/0.13823) ≈ √(577,800) ≈ 760 m/s. Then D_K = (1e-8/3)*760 ≈ 2.53e-6 m²/s. The effective diffusivity D_eff = D_K * ε / τ, where ε is porosity and τ is tortuosity. Using ε = 0.5 (typical for coal chars due to micro- and macro-pore development during pyrolysis, as char structure affects internal mass transport) and τ = 2.5, D_eff = 2.53e-6 * 0.5 / 2.5 ≈ 5.06e-7 m²/s. For diffusion length L = 0.1 mm = 1e-4 m (based on the paper's discussion of pore structure and internal mass transport in coal chars, where characteristic lengths for diffusion in porous coal matrix are on the order of 0.1 mm), τ_diff = (1e-4)² / 5.06e-7 ≈ 1e-8 / 5.06e-7 ≈ 0.0198 s. According to the paper, 'Both binary diffusion and Knudsen diffusion are important in the small pores of the coal matrix' and 'The effective reactivity of the char is a function of its intrinsic reactivity, the total available surface area and the diffusion of the reactants and products within its porous structure.' These citations indicate that pore diffusion is a key factor influencing char reactivity in UCG by controlling mass transport within the porous char structure, which can limit or enhance the overall gasification rate depending on pore characteristics and operating conditions, as diffusion affects the accessibility of reactants to the internal surface area.",

Using √(8*8.314*1200/(π*0.044)) should give √(79872/0.13823) ≈ √(577,800) ≈ 760 m/s, but the molecular weight M for CO2 should be in kg/mol (0.044) and R in J/mol·K, so the calculation is dimensionally inconsistent. The correct calculation should use consistent units: √(8RT/(πM)) = √(8*8.314*1200/(π*0.044)) ≈ √(79872/0.13823) ≈ √(577,800) ≈ 760 m/s is actually correct numerically, but the explanation of units is confusing. More importantly, the Knudsen diffusion coefficient formula D_K = (d_pore/3)*√(8RT/(πM)) is standard, but the subsequent calculation of D_eff and τ_diff appears correct numerically."
