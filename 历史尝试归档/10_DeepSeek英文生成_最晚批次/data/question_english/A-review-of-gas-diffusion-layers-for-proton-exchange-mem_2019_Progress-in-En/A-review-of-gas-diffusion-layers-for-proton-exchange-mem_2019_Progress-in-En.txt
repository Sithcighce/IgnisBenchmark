Proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells are at the dawn of commercialization. Their operation and
design characteristics, hence their performance, are closely linked to the multiphase transport of mass,
heat, and electricity in the cell constituents, a critical of which is the gas diffusion layer (GDL). The GDL’s
transport capability is represented by its effective transport properties: an effective diffusion coefficient
for the diffusional transport of mass, absolute and relative permeabilities for the convective transport
of mass, effective thermal conductivity for the heat transport, and effective electron conductivity for the
electricity transport; in addition, surface wettability impacts the transport of liquid water. These transport
properties depend on the GDL’s mechanical, morphological, microstructural, and physical characteristics,
which are in turn controlled by its materials and design parameters. This review article therefore focuses
on the insights and comprehensive understanding of three critical issues of the GDLs: (i) their morpho-
logical, microstructural, and physical characteristics, (ii) ex- and in-situ characterization techniques for
the determination of their effective transport and mechanical properties, and (iii) frequently used mate-
rials and design strategies and their relevant influences on the effective transport properties in order to
achieve reliable and durable performance of PEM fuel cells with high power densities.

1. Introduction

Fuel cells, as the energy-conversion device for direct and effec-
tive conversion of the chemical energy of a fuel and an oxidant
into electrical energy, are now on the verge of becoming compet-
itive for clean power generation in a variety of sectors [1–5] . The
primary fuel cell types are proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel
cells (also known as PEFCs), (ii) solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), (iii)
alkaline fuel cells (AFCs), (iv) molten carbonate fuel cells (MCFCs),
and (v) phosphoric acid fuel cells (PAFCs) [1,3,6–8] . Among them,
specifically PEM fuel cells have garnered a great deal of attention
and  are  regarded  as  an  up-and-coming  power  source  for  trans-
portation, stationary, and portable applications, owing to their high
energy-conversion efficiency, quick startup, simple design, and en-
vironmental benignity [7,9–14] .

A  PEM  fuel  cell  possesses  a  multi-layered  architecture  and
typically  consists  of  anode  and  cathode  flow-field  plates  and  a
membrane-electrode assembly (MEA), as schematically illustrated
in Fig. 1 [15] . The flow-field plates are mainly responsible for the
distribution of hydrogen and oxygen over the respective surfaces of
the MEA via the flow channels. The MEA is the pivotal part of the
fuel cell system and comprised of anode and cathode gas diffusion
layers (GDLs) and catalyst layers, the anode and cathode sides be-
ing separated by a proton-conducting membrane. The membrane

is primarily responsible for proton transport from the anode to the
cathode, besides acting as a barrier that prevents reactant and by-
product species as well as electrons other than protons from reach-
ing the cathode. The catalyst layer is made of electrochemically ac-
tive  nanoparticles  (usually  platinum)  dispersed  on  comparatively
larger particles, typically carbon or graphite [16,17] , all these parti-
cles are surrounded by an ionomer [18] ; so that the catalyst layer
provides a platform for the simultaneous transport of the reactants,
products, and charged species including both electrons and protons
[19–21] . Both the ionomer and the membrane require hydration for
the effective transport of the protons.

During  the  cell  operation,  humidified  hydrogen  and  oxygen
gases  are  distributed  over  the  surfaces  of  the  anode  and  cath-
ode GDLs, respectively, via the anode and cathode flow channels
grooved into their respective flow-field plates. Under the combined
effect of comparatively dominant diffusion and a lesser degree of
convection, hydrogen and oxygen are transported through their re-
spective GDLs, then diffuse into the catalyst layers where the hy-
drogen  oxidation  reaction  (HOR)  and  oxygen  reduction  reaction
(ORR) occur as follows:

Anode reaction :  H 2 → 2 H

+ + 2 e
−

Cathode reaction :  1 / 2 O 2 + 2 H

+ + 2 e

− → H 2 O

(1)

(2)

Thus the whole cell reaction becomes:

Overall reaction :  H 2 + 1

2 O 2 → H 2 O + electricity + waste heat

(3)

The  electrons  generated  successively  travel  through  the  elec-
tronically conductive catalyst nanoparticles within the anode cata-
lyst layer, anode GDL, and anode flow-field plate to reach the exter-
nal circuit. Then, the electrons flow back into the cell through the
cathode  flow-field  plate  and  the  cathode  GDL,  eventually  reach-
ing  the  catalyst  nanoparticles  inside  the  cathode  catalyst  layer.
The  protons,  however,  consecutively  travel  through  the  ionomer
in the anode catalyst layer, proton-conducting membrane and the
ionomer  surrounding  catalyst  nanoparticles  in  the  cathode  cata-
lyst layer. As the protons travel through the membrane, they also
carry water molecules along with them, a mechanism known as
“electro-osmotic  drag” [22,23] .  The  water,  either  formed at  the
ionomer/cathode catalyst layer interface or carried by the protons,
is  then  successively  (i)  absorbed  into  the  ionomer,  (ii)  diffused
through  the  void  regions  within  the  cathode  catalyst  layer,  (iii)
transported through the available pores of the GDL, and eventu-
ally (iv) exhausted from the cell through the cathode flow chan-
nels [24] . However, a certain amount of the water at the mem-
brane/cathode catalyst layer interface may diffuse from the cath-
ode to the anode through the membrane, because of the hydraulic
pressure and/or water concentration difference between the cath-
ode and anode, a phenomenon commonly referred to as “back dif-
fusion” [23,25] .

under high-current density operation [45] . Therefore, optimization
of transport properties within porous components will conclusively
advance cell performance, particularly in the “concentration over-
potential” region, which is quite desirable for commercial applica-
tions because operating efficiently at high-current densities means
that smaller and more cost-effective fuel cells can be manufactured
for a desired power requirement, and that a relatively longer range
can be achieved without refilling [46] .

In this regards, the criticality of the GDL, as the performance-
limiting porous component that plays vital roles in mass, heat, and
electricity transport, has been increasingly recognized [47,48] . The
GDL  is  typically  a  wet-proofed  and  carbon-based  product,  com-
prised of a macroporous substrate (MPS) ( i.e. , single layer GDL) and
often an MPL. The MPS consists of horizontally and anisotropically
stacked carbon fibres and is in direct contact with the flow-field
plate, thus serving as a bridge for mass, heat, and electron trans-
port [49] . However, as schematically described in Fig. 1 , the MPL,
typically  comprised  of  a  carbon-based  powder  and  a  hydropho-
bic agent, is mainly responsible for the management of multiple-
phase flow [50] . The capability of the GDL for mass, heat, and elec-
tron transport is represented by its effective transport properties:
the diffusion coefficient, permeability, surface wettability, thermal
conductivity, and electrical conductivity, respectively [51] . For two-
phase flow conditions, absolute and relative permeability are the
representative of the fluid transport through the GDL, while cap-
illary  pressure  is  indicative  of  its  surface  wettability  characteris-
tics  [52] .  The  transport  properties  of  the  GDL  are  closely  linked
to its morphological, microstructural, and physical characteristics,
which are the strong functions of its material and design param-
eters (see [53–57] , for example). Hence, a complete understanding
of the parameters affecting the GDL transport properties and the
experimental methods for the in- and ex-situ characterizations of
GDLs would greatly help optimization and accurate evaluation of
the  GDL  transport  properties,  which  would  conclusively  advance
the commercial viability of PEM fuel cell technology.

The present work is therefore aimed at providing effective in-
sights and a comprehensive understanding of these critical issues,
i.e. , morphological, microstructural, and physical characteristics of
GDLs;  ex-  and  in-situ  GDL  characterization  techniques;  and  fre-
quently employed materials and design strategies for GDLs, along
with their potential impacts on the GDL transport properties. This
article is specifically organized as a comprehensive and fundamen-
tal  review  that  introduces  interested  readers  to  fundamental  as-
pects of PEM fuel cell technology, with a particular focus on GDLs.
The article provides a critical and detailed review of the advances
made to date in the above-mentioned aspects and highlights the
remaining knowledge gaps that require further research. It begins
with an overview of GDL characteristics and experimental charac-
terization techniques, with subsections focusing on each of the ob-
jectives listed above, and then ends with a brief synopsis of the
progress achieved and outlook for future studies.

2. The gas diffusion layer

As  schematically  described  in  Fig.  1 ,  the  gas  diffusion  layer
(GDL), as a wet-proofed and carbon-based material, is employed
between the flow-field plates and the catalyst layers on both the
anode and cathode sides of the cell. The GDL plays multifaceted
roles  in  cell  operation  by  controlling  mass,  heat,  and  electron
transport. It also provides robust mechanical support and protec-
tion for the delicate catalyst layer and membrane during both as-
sembly and operation. The GDL is specifically designed as a porous
material for the simultaneous accomplishment of these functions.
The void region mainly controls the transport of reactants and by-
product water that flow in reverse directions, while the remaining
solid structure provides pathways for electron and heat transport.

cell, adapted from [26] .

Waste heat is another by-product generated as a consequence
of the ORR and HOR, as well as continuous charge transport within
the  cell  constituents.  The  heat  transfer  during  cell  operation  is
largely driven by conduction through the stacked cell constituents,
with slight influence coming from convection and radiation, par-
ticularly through the void regions [24] . The heat generated inside
the cell is predominantly expelled by conduction to the neighbor-
ing cooling cell in a stack environment (not shown in Fig. 1 ) and
on a lesser degree by the fully humidified reactant gas streams in
the flow channels [26,27] . Current state-of-the-art PEM fuel cells
are typically assembled with perfluorosulfonic acid membranes, in
which proton transport is controlled by two well-known mecha-
nisms – “Vehicular” and “Grotthus” – which only function prop-
erly in the presence of sufficient water [28–30] . Accordingly, any
dry-spot formation within the membrane due to ineffective water
(or heat) management induces a marked increase in local mem-
brane  resistance,  deteriorating  overall  cell  performance,  stability,
and durability [31] . The availability of water is thus essential. How-
ever, excess water in the porous electrode structure should be ef-
fectively  removed  to  prevent  from  performance  loss  (that  is,  to
avoid  the  so-called  “water  flooding” phenomena)  and  potential
freeze-thaw  degradation  [32–37] .  Establishing  a  delicate  balance
between water production and water removal trade-off is therefore
of paramount importance. If the balance favors the former, notice-
able deterioration in cell performance will likely occur, mainly trig-
gered by the mass transfer limitations [38–40] . If, however, the bal-
ance favors the latter, similarly, substantial performance decay re-
lating to increased membrane resistance will unavoidably emerge
[41,42] .

By  all  accounts,  mass,  heat,  and  electricity  transport  mech-
anisms  are  interrelated  and  connected  in  series  and/or  se-
ries/parallel combinations; therefore, any weakness in one mech-
anism will likely adversely impact the others, and thus decrease
cell performance [24,43] . A better understanding of the influence
of the transport phenomena on cell performance might be gained
through taking a closer look at a typical PEM fuel cell polarization
curve – a plot of the relation between the output cell voltage and
current density [26] . As seen in Fig. 2 , the polarization curve can
be characterized into three different regions: activation overpoten-
tial,  ohmic  overpotential,  and  concentration  overpotential.  These
regions are named after considering the dominant transport phe-
nomenon in a certain voltage range, even though all the transport
mechanisms are active in a large range of cell voltages [26,44] . The
region named “concentration overpotential” is the representative of
the mass transport limitations coming into prominence, especially

The GDL in general has two distinct layers: a macroporous sub-
strate (MPS) and a microporous layer (MPL). The following subsec-
tion provides further information on the structure of the GDL.

2.1. Structures

2.1.1. Macroporous substrate

A carbon-based MPS, typically a carbon paper, may be identi-
fied  best  as  a  carbon-carbon  composite,  in  which  randomly  and
horizontally stacked brittle carbon fibres (with 7–9 μm diameter)
are bound into a web-like matrix by a polymeric binder [58,59] .
This unique architecture is formed in the fabrication process [60] ,
through  which  stacked  carbon  fiber  sheets  undergo  consecutive
carbonization and graphitization stages in specifically designed fur-
naces.  On  completion  of  these  stages,  the  carbon  fibers  acquire
graphite-like properties, while the resin-based binder remains as
amorphous carbon; the resulting microstructure therefore contains
anisotropically oriented carbon fibers in both the in- and through-
plane  directions  [24,60] .  Following  high-temperature  treatment,
MPSs are impregnated in a suspension of polymeric binder prior
to a final treatment for stabilization. The obtained structure is then
subjected to hydrophobic agent treatment for adequate hydropho-
bicity. As summarized in Table 1 , with today’s technology, MPSs
with wide range of specifications are available from more than one
manufacturer at reasonable costs. However, depending on the MPS
manufacturer,  the  manufacturing  process  can  show  slight  differ-
ences. Fig. 3 schematically describes the methodology followed for
the manufacturing of Sigracet ® GDL (MPS + MPL) [61,62] .

The  MPSs  are  basically  180–400 μm  carbon  sheets  and  pos-
sess a quite porous morphology, such that a majority of pores in
MPSs is in the range of 10–30 μm according to Ref. [58] , but more
likely  in  the  range  of  20–100 μm  according  to  Refs.  [60,63] .  The
physical structure of the MPS is generally analyzed according to
its ex-situ characteristics, such as porosity, pore size distribution,

thickness, compressibility, and effective diffusion pathway length;
however, as often noted [11] , these characteristics can significantly
change,  due  to  the  mechanical  compression  applied  in  cell  op-
eration.  The  MPSs  are  often  coated  with  the  MPLs  to  achieve  a
porosity-gradient structure. Further information on the structure of
MPLs is provided in the next section.

2.1.2. Microporous layer

An  MPL  may  be  best  described  as  a  simple  composite  of  a
carbon  powder  and  a  hydrophobic  agent.  As  the  name  implies,
the MPL is conventionally pronounced as a stand-alone layer, but
it  is  not  a  layer,  which  has  a  clear  interface  with  the  MPS.  Be-
cause the MPL structure is comprised of small-scale carbon pow-
der/hydrophobic  agent  agglomerates;  some  of  these  agglomer-
ates  can  be  even  several  orders  of  magnitude  smaller  than  the
open  pores  of  the  MPSs,  and  hence  they  are  likely  to  penetrate
into these comparatively larger pores, with possible modification
to  their  architectures.  This  penetration  pattern  is  a  strong  func-
tion  of  several  parameters,  such  as  specifications  of  the  carbon
powder,  hydrophobic  agent,  MPL  slurry,  and  manufacturing  pro-
cess, and can significantly affect the resulting MPL thickness. The
manufacturing of a typical MPL involves three consecutive steps:
MPL slurry preparation, deposition, and sintering. In the first two
steps,  carbon  or  graphite  particles  are  mechanically  mixed  with
hydrophobic-agent dispersed in water, and/or sometimes organic
additives, and the resulting slurry is deposited onto the MPS sur-
face.  The  MPL  deposition  can  be  done  through  different  meth-
ods, such as brushing, blading, spraying, and dipping/floating. In
recent years, interestingly, the MPL has also been separately pre-
pared as a self-supported substrate and then assembled onto the
MPS  surface  [65] ;  however,  this  manufacturing  technique  is  not
a  common  practice  in  the  fuel  cell  field.  On  completion  of  the
MPL deposition, the resulting now GDL is subjected to heat treat-
ment, typically around 240 °C for 30–40 min to remove any remain-

ing moisture, a crucial step for the accuracy of the carbon load-
ing. The fully dried GDL is then sintered at a higher temperature
(typically  350  °C)  for  30–60 min  to  ensure  that  the  hydrophobic
agent distributes throughout the MPL, as this distribution is critical
to imparting homogeneous surface characteristics [66] . Depending
on the specifications of the manufacturing process as well as the
aforementioned parameters, the MPL thickness can show a great
variation, typically between 10 and 100 μm [67] . Since the MPL is
not a stand-alone layer, its pore size is practically considered in
terms  of  its  contribution  to  the  known  pore  size  distribution  of
the MPS; however, building on the above description, its deposi-
tion onto the MPS causes a significant drop in the pore size range.

2.2. Characteristics

2.2.1. Morphology

As  discussed  in  depth  later,  the  morphology  of  the  GDL  can
be investigated via various characterization techniques and appa-
ratuses. Among them, the scanning electron microscope (SEM) is
commonly used for MPS, GDL, and even catalyst layer characteri-
zation [68] . SEM can provide a great deal of information pertaining
to the overall description of surface topographies, including surface
cracks and valleys [69] . The images recorded via SEM from the sur-
face and cross-sectional views of MPSs (carbon papers with and
without a hydrophobic treatment) and the GDL (MPL coated MPS)
are shown in Fig. 4 . As evident from Fig. 4 (a), the MPS possesses
open pores with the sizes of tens of micrometers, formed by the
interconnected network built up by the carbon fibers. The carbon
fibers are indeed superfine cylinders positioned arbitrarily in the
in-plane direction. The carbon fibers that lie in the in-plane direc-
tion are also stacked randomly. The MPS yields highly anisotropic
microstructure characteristics, due to the arbitrarily oriented car-
bon fibers, particularly in the in-plane direction, confirming that
the MPS itself would not provide a desirable platform for catalyst

deposition  and  would  greatly  increase  interfacial  electrical  resis-
tance. The influence of hydrophobic agent treatment on the mi-
crostructure of the MPS is also clear; the hydrophobic agent ac-
cumulated  mainly  in  the  regions  near  the  surface  takes  on  the
shape of the interconnected network ( Fig. 4 (b)), which may lead
to a decrease in the macro-pore volume and shrinking in the pore-
size distribution [70] . This observation has been quantitatively con-
firmed by Zamel et al. [71] through standard porosimetry analyses.
Even though SEM imaging provides qualitative information about
pore  characteristics,  standard  porosimetry  analyses,  as  discussed
later, provide quantitative and more-precise information in terms
of pore characteristics (see [47,53,72] , for example).

Fig.  4 (c)  shows  the  SEM  image  obtained  from  the  GDL
(MPS + MPL).  Clearly,  the  MPL  coated  MPS  possesses  distinctively
different morphology; it has a more compact porous structure to-
gether with no visible open pores, along with interconnected sur-
face cracks ranging from 5 to 15 μm in width (as dimensioned by
the  blue  dimension  line),  analogous  to  mud  cracks  in  soil.  This
crack-containing surface morphology is quite common for the MPL
coated MPSs; for example, see Refs. [73,74] . As a matter of fact,
such  a  compact  layer  could  reasonably  provide  better  mechani-
cal support and protection for the catalyst layer and minimize the
electrical interfacial resistance. It is also clear that the MPL layer
tends to penetrate into the MPS and form a compact composite-
like architecture ( Fig. 4 (d)), which likely lessens the volume of the
macropores within the MPS and makes some of the physical char-
acteristics ( e.g. , electrical and thermal conductivities) more uniform
in the in- and through-plane directions. This uniformity correlates
well with the formation of a uniform penetration profile. The pen-
etration of the MPL into the MPS and formation of the mud cracks
mainly  relate  to  the  MPL  deposition  process,  which  is  typically
through wet-coating [75] . The penetration profile, however, is also
affected by the specifications of the employed carbon powder ( e.g. ,
particle size and shape), and hence different powders may exhibit

different penetration behavior. As is clear from the above discus-
sion, the MPS and GDL (MPS + MPL) are quite dissimilar in terms of
morphology and microstructure, and microstructural and morpho-
logical characteristics are interdependent.

2.2.1.1. Techniques for morphology determination.  The scanning elec-
tron  microscope  (SEM)  [76,77] ,  optical  microscope  [78] ,  atomic
force microscope (AFM) [79] , confocal laser scanning microscope
(CLSM)  [80] ,  and  three-dimensional  surface  profiler  [81]  are  key
apparatuses  for  the  morphological  characterization  of  the  MPSs
and GDLs, as well as the catalyst layers. Since each has been specif-
ically  engineered  for  different  measurement  purposes,  the  scope
and accuracy of information obtained from the measurements con-
ducted  with  these  different  tools  exhibit  noticeable  differences.
Herein, the usage scope of these tools, together with their main
strengths and weaknesses, is described briefly.

SEM, as a commonly employed apparatus for morphology and
microstructure characterizations, can provide large quantities of in-
formation  in  two  dimensions.  However,  its  capability  in  provid-
ing information on surface perturbations that specifically demon-
strate  great  variations  in  the  vertical  direction  is  quite  limited.
Hence, it is fairly challenging to acquire quantitative, and more im-
portantly, accurate information regarding surface roughness from
two-dimensional images [69] . Very recently, SEM imaging has been
also used together with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS)
analysis  to  quantify  the  fluorine  (F)  content  distribution  in  the
through-plane direction of GDLs, since F is a clear indicator of the

presence of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) in the GDL microstruc-
ture, owing to its abundance in PTFE and absence in carbon-fiber
GDL;  for  example,  see  Refs.  [58,82,83] .  Besides  SEM,  the  opti-
cal  microscope  is  also  a  widely  employed  tool  for  imaging,  be-
cause  it  is  relatively  cheaper  and  faster  and  also  applicable  to
many varieties of samples with any surface roughness. Although
SEM and optical microscope can be used for the similar measure-
ment purposes, the latter’s capability to provide quantitative sur-
face information is not very satisfactory, because of its limited fo-
cus depth and resolution capabilities [69] . AFM is also extensively
used  to  investigate  the  surface  morphology  of  MPSs  and  GDLs,
and it provides more-precise information about quantitative sur-
face roughness from three-dimensional data, together with other
surface characteristics, including conductive regions and adhesion
force distributions.

However, AFM’s applicability to the MPSs and GDLs is restricted
by  its  limited  scanning  area  and  measurement  speed.  Confocal
laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) is another tool that can be em-
ployed to gain deeper understanding of morphological details. For
example, it can provide specific information about the physical in-
teractions between the binder and fibrous material; this informa-
tion can further be utilized to develop binder models [80] . A three-
dimensional surface profiler allows determination of the two- or
three-dimensional surface profiles of the MPS and GDL, along with
crests  and  valleys  [81] .  Fig.  5  compares  the  topographies  of  the
MPS ( i.e. , carbon paper with and without hydrophobic treatment)
and the GDL (MPL coated MPS), and Fig. 6 presents the detailed

consists  of  approximately  8 μm  diameter  carbon  fibers  that  are
chemically and mechanically bound to each other to form an ap-
proximately  180–400 μm  thick  sheet  with  adequate  mechanical
strength  [84] .  The  MPS  thus  contains  macro-scale  pores  ranging
from 10 μm to 100 μm – that is, a large portion of its pore volume
is taken up by macro-scale pores [85] . However, the GDL generally
contains an additional thin layer, known as the MPL, which typi-
cally consists of nano- to micro-scale carbon particles bounded by
a hydrophobic agent [86–88] . Upon deposition of a thin MPL on
the MPS, the resulting GDL mean pore size can be in the range of
15–200 nm, which is noticeably smaller than that of the MPS [67] .
Also, the pore structure of the resulting GDL is fairly complex due
to the inherently different pore structures of the MPS and GDL, as
well as the way they are linked.

The pores within the MPSs and GDLs basically fall into three
categories according  to their size: those  with the radius smaller
than  50 nm  are  classified  as  micropores,  those  with  the  radius
between  50  and  70 0 0 nm  as  mesopores,  and  those  with  the  ra-
dius  larger  than  70 0 0 nm  as  macropores  [89] .  This  categoriza-
tion  facilitates  the  description  for  the  different  pore  characteris-
tics of various porous materials and may demonstrate small vari-
ations in different reports (see [47,90,91] , for example). The fun-
damental  concept  behind  this  categorization  is  to  gain  a  better
understanding of the mass transport capabilities of porous medi-
ums with different microstructures. The gas-phase reactant trans-
port in a porous medium is primarily accomplished by two dif-
ferent mechanisms: diffusion and convection. The reactant trans-
port  through  diffusion  makes  up  a  large  portion  of  the  overall
mass transport and involves the effects of bulk diffusion and Knud-
sen  diffusion  [92] .  Herein,  determination  of  the  volume  of  each
pore category (or pore size distribution) offers an opportunity to
understand which diffusion mechanism has the dominant impact
on  the  overall  gas-phase  reactant  transport.  Under  the  assump-
tion that the mean free paths of hydrogen and nitrogen at stan-
dard  conditions  are  ∼74 nm  and  ∼68 nm,  respectively,  the  mean
free  path  of  air  may  be  estimated  to  be  ∼70 nm  [89] .  The  gas-
phase  reactant  transport  through  bulk  diffusion  becomes  domi-
nant, as the diameter of the pores, through which gas-phase re-
actants diffuse, is two orders of magnitude higher than the mean
free path of air or 70 0 0 nm, while the Knudsen diffusion becomes
dominant, as the diameter of the pores is less than one-tenth of
the mean free path of air or 7 nm [93] . For any pore diameter be-
tween these defined limits, the diffusional gas transport occurs un-
der the combined effect of these two mechanisms. Since the diffu-
sion coefficient in the bulk diffusion regime is significantly higher
than that in the Knudsen diffusion regime (up to three orders of
magnitude), the presence of larger pores (or macropores) substan-
tially contributes to bulk diffusion, thus facilitating gas-phase mass
transport [89] .

However, as we have seen, the pores inside a porous medium
are  not  straight  in  the  through-plane  direction;  therefore,  gas
molecules  inevitably  follow  an  indirect  and  convoluted  route  to
traverse the void region [94] . Such a microstructure decreases the
diffusion coefficients to a specific value, termed effective diffusivity
( D
eff) [95,96] . Therefore, the gas-phase reactant transport within a
porous media is closely related to the microstructural character-
istics,  which  will  be  discussed  later.  This  inherent,  macroscopic,
and effective transport property – effective diffusivity – should be
carefully optimized to establish a delicate balance between reac-
tant  transport  and  water  management  [97] .  Thus,  both  the  MPS
and GDL must undergo a hydrophobic treatment to achieve ade-
quately hydrophobic and favorable pore characteristics, and hence
desirable effective diffusivity.

The importance of balanced transport characteristics might be
better  understood  through  a  closer  look  at  the  Young-Laplace
equation  – which  correlates  the  pore  radius  with  the  capillary

topography of the MPS, together with its thickness uniformity. The
three dimensional (3D) topographic images are recorded by a digi-
tal microscope (Keyence VHX-20 0 0), equipped with a surface pro-
filer module. As shown in Fig. 5 , the profiler has the ability to de-
pict the highest and lowest points on the surface, as well as the
regions between these points – that is, the profiler allows deter-
mination of the entire surface profile, and hence the thickness uni-
formity of the sample. In Fig. 6 , the surface topology of the MPS is
shown in the top left side, and the actual MPS surface, from which
the surface topology obtained, is presented in the top right side,
while the surface profile of the MPS between two points (as indi-
cated by the red crosses) along the line (as indicated by the blue
line) is quantitatively presented in the bottom side of the image –
that is, the surface profiler provides information pertaining to the
surface elevation profiles of the porous fuel cell components along
a desirable axis.

2.2.2. Pore structure

As  mentioned  earlier,  carbon-based  MPSs  and  GDLs  possess
distinctively different morphologies and microstructures. The MPS

pressure and surface wettability, as follows [98,99] :

r

(4)

P c = − 2 γ cos θ
where P c is the capillary pressure, γ is the surface tension of the
liquid, θ is the contact angle of the liquid with the pore surface,
and r is the radius of the pore. The capillary pressure in a porous
medium is defined as the difference between the pressures of the
liquid and gas phases, P c = P g − P
l , across the static liquid-gas inter-
faces [100] . A common approach to evaluate the GDLs’ wettability
characteristics is to obtain the water-air capillary pressure curves
experimentally (for example, see Ref. [101] ) or incorporate the Lev-
erett J function into continuum models to consider the relation-
ship between capillary pressure and water saturation (for example,
see Ref. [102] ). In cell operation, the water vapor becomes satu-
rated at the triple-phase boundary. Then, it starts to fill the void
regions and builds up a pressure gradient – from higher to lower
liquid saturation areas – which is the main driving force for wa-
ter transport. For a hydrophilic porous medium, liquid water can
more easily penetrate and fill the void regions, whereas for a hy-
drophobic porous medium, the liquid phase is difficult to penetrate
(or more work is required) [89] . The capillary pressure increases
with  decreasing  hydrophobic  pore  radius,  whereupon  larger  hy-
drophobic pores are more susceptible to water flooding [89,103] ,
clearly accounting for why application of an MPL facilitates water
removal. Such behaviour can be considered a simplified form of a

far complex phenomenon – usually referred to as “hysteric wet-
ting/dewetting” [104,105] .

To highlight the microstructure achieved upon MPL deposition,
a  comparison  is  made  of  the  differential  pore  size  distributions
in the MPL and GDL (MPL + MPS), as seen in Fig. 7 [67,106] . The

58

porosities  (defined  as  the  ratio  of  cumulative  pore  volume  over
bulk volume) of the MPS and GDL are calculated to be around 73–
74% and 65–66%, respectively [67,106] . For the MPS, approximately
7% of the cumulative pore volume is in the micro-pore range, 42%
is  in  the  meso-pore  range,  and  51%  is  in  the  macro-pore  range
[67,106] . However, for the GDL (MPS + MPL), about 33% of the cu-
mulative pore volume is taken up by the micropores, while 39%
and 28% of that comprises the mesopores and macropores, respec-
tively [67,106] . It is clear that deposition of the MPL causes a no-
ticeable increase in the micro-pore volume, but a substantial drop
in the meso- and macro-pore volumes. The increase in the micro-
pore volume can be attributed to the small spaces formed at the
interfaces of the hydrophobic agent/carbon particles/carbon fibers,
while the reduced meso- and macro-pore volume indicates that a
certain portion of the pre-existing meso and macropores is filled
with the carbon particle/hydrophobic agent agglomerates [67,106] .
Overall, it seems that the GDL (MPS + MPL) possesses more uniform
micro-, meso-, and macro-pore distribution than the MPS.

The pore characteristics achieved upon deposition of the MPL
are  known  to  reduce  water  saturation  near  the  catalyst  layer,
contribute  to  the  formation  of  more  uniform  water  distribution,
and  mitigate  water  flooding  at  the  cathode  by  increasing  the
back-diffusion  rate  of  water  [107–109] .  In  recent  years,  contin-
uum models have been developed to understand the mechanisms
behind  the  transport-enhancing  influences  of  the  MPL.  However,
their effectiveness is still “questionable”, since they do not include
macroscopic-level water transport phenomena. There is also a lack
of a clear understanding of electrochemical dynamic processes, be-
cause of the difficulties ( i.e. , technical limitations) in examining the
macroscopic level water transport phenomena inside the GDL dur-
ing cell operation [109] . Thus, the techniques in use today mainly
rely on ex-situ investigations. For example, X-ray tomographic mi-
croscopy (XTM) analysis can be considered as a good example of
these investigations. XTM allows for resolutions as high as in the
order of one micrometer, and thus it can be used for examining
local water saturation regions in GDLs [110] . Owing to its high spa-
tial resolution as well as concurrent contrast for water and carbon
fibers, XTM enables researchers to investigate the water condensa-
tion profiles in GDLs through 3D-imaging of the liquid and solid
regions [110] . For interested readers, some interesting illustrations
of water condensation patterns in GDLs can be found in Ref. [110] .
More recently, several physical models that rely on either syn-
chrotron X-ray radiography visualizations or environmental scan-
ning  electron  microscopy  (ESEM)  observations  supported  with
water-transport pore-network analyses have been proposed to pro-
vide insights into the transport-enhancing roles of the MPLs (see
[111,112] , for example). These models hypothesize that water satu-
ration occurs primarily in the catalyst layer, because it possesses an
adequate solid-fluid interfacial region, and that the condensed liq-
uid water starts to fill the pores at the catalyst layer/MPL interface
and  progressively  spreads  over  the  entire  MPL  surface  [111,113] .
Interested  readers  can  also  refer  to  Ref.  [111]  for  the  ESEM  mi-
crographs describing the vapor saturation and liquid water break-
throughs obtained at different elapsed times from the CL, MPL, and
MPS. As is clear from the micrographs [111] , once sufficient wa-
ter is accumulated and a critical breakthrough pressure is reached,
the liquid water penetrates gradually into the MPL from the first
breakthrough locations. Herein, presence of the MPL is expected to
be advantageous for forming more breakthrough locations, through
which liquid water can percolate in a more effective manner [114] .
ESEM micrographs recorded for the MPL indicate that the perco-
lated water initially forms a few small water droplets on the sur-
face  of  the  MPL,  but  they  increase  in  number  substantially,  and
eventually,  in  some  locations,  small  water  droplets  coalesce  into
a  larger  droplet  [111] .  However,  the  resulting  water  droplets  are
still much smaller than those formed on the MPS. Because of its

large macro-pore volume (and hence porosity), the MPS is highly
susceptible to water flooding; in which large liquid droplets ini-
tially fill the macropores of the MPS and then coalesce into large
connected water clusters, prior to percolating through the break-
throughs  [112] .  The  differences  in  the  condensation  and  trans-
port patterns of liquid water are summarized in Fig. 8 , depend-
ing  on  the  microstructural  characteristics  of  the  MPS  and  GDL
(MPS + MPL).

Even though some insights into the general water generation
and transport phenomenon can be gained, these ex-situ investiga-
tions still have some limitations, as they are not performed un-
der actual fuel cell operating conditions. However, as mentioned
earlier,  experimental  difficulties,  such  as  small  scale  and  limited
optical access, have been the biggest challenge towards the suc-
cessful application of in-situ investigation techniques [115] . Owing
to its high sensitivity for liquid water transport, Neutron radiog-
raphy  (NR)  has  been  the  very  first  technique  applied  for  in-situ
water  transport  examination  [115] .  However,  the  technical  limi-
tations, such as limited water attenuation averaging capability of
both the radiography setup and the resolution of neutron imaging
have prevented the clear visualization of individual water clusters,
hence local solid/liquid interactions, in GDLs [115] . Very recently,
in the experimental study conducted by Eller et al. [115] , XTM has
been successfully applied as an in-situ technique to visualize wa-
ter transport in GDLs on the pore scale level. The technique has
been applied in specifically designed cell setups, and it provides
the advantage of high quality data acquisition through the setup’s
spatial resolution to solid to liquid contrast [115] . In the setup, the
image processing script has also been specifically designed to sepa-
rate the phases and identify the critical properties of the liquid, i.e. ,
droplet size and local saturation, in pores of the GDL [115] . Further
information on the technique and experimental setup can be found
in [115] , while model predictions as well as their comparison with
the experimental data obtained through XTM and NR can be found
in [116,117] .

2.2.2.1. Techniques for pore structure determination .  The pore struc-
ture of the MPS and GDL (MPS + MPL) can be qualitatively exam-
ined by the methods discussed in the previous section for mor-
phological characterization. Accordingly, in this section, the focus
will be mostly on methods that can provide quantitative informa-
tion about the pore structures of MPS and GDL. Mercury porosime-
try [118,119] , capillary flow porometry [82,120] , standard porosime-
try  [13,121] ,  and  kerosene  density  [122]  are  probably  the  most
popular methods for the quantitative characterization of a porous
medium. As discussed in the following subsections, each has ad-
vantages  and  limitations.  As  an  illustration,  they  all  obtain  the
quantitative data with the assumption that the capillary structure
of  porous  media  is  represented  by  a  bunch  of  cylindrical  tubes.
Therefore,  the  inferences  about  the  internal  structure  of  porous
medium through these techniques should be made with particu-
lar consideration [68] . In recent years, quantitative techniques have
been integrated into visual analyses to obtain more accurate and
complete information. The combination of computerized X-ray to-
mography (CXT) and mercury porosimetry can be a good exam-
ple. Even though CXT was originally employed to investigate small-
scale structures – for example, secondary pore structures within
the catalyst layer, its nominal resolution ( ∼50 nm) is not sufficient
to distinguish the materials within the catalyst layer. This limita-
tion is fairly reasonable when considering that the catalyst layer is
comprised of 2–7 nm Pt nanoparticles, 5–15 nm-thin ionomer films,
and 20–40 nm carbon or carbon-like supports [123] . The combina-
tion of CXT and mercury porosimetry enables accurate detection
of the length scales down to 3 nm [124] – a combination that of-
fers benefits in examining nano-scale structures over macroscopic
dimensions [123] . Likewise, the use of CXT, together with another

intrusion method – low melting point alloy intrusion – is an ef-
fective approach for accurate characterization of small-scale struc-
tures [125] . In summary, it may be understood that, particularly
for small-scale pore structures, visual and quantitative methods are
complementary, thus facilitating interpretation of any ambiguity in
the data explored.

2.2.2.1.1. Method of standard porosimetry . Standard porosimetry
is  a  non-destructive  and  simple-to-perform  method  by  which  a
porous medium comprising of pores in a wide range of 0.3 nm–
100 μm can be characterized under room conditions. It can be em-
ployed  with  various  working  fluids,  i.e. ,  octane,  decane,  ethanol,
and water, depending on the specifications of the samples. How-
ever,  for  the  structural  characterization  of  MPS  and  GDL,  octane
is  preferred,  owing  to  its  distinctively  small  wetting  angle  [24] .
Even though standard porosimetry is basically used to obtain in-
formation about pore size distribution and porosity, this method
also offers an opportunity to achieve other parameters, such as the
cumulative  pore  surface  area,  bulk  density,  and  mean  pore  size.
In a basic experiment, three samples, two of them standard and
the other a test sample, are employed. The standard samples are
porous disks specifically designed so that the contact angle at the
solid/fluid interface is exactly 0 ° [71] . The method relies on deter-
mining the capillary pressure curve of porous medium by utilizing
the known capillary pressure curves of the two standard samples
[126] . Prior to measurements, both the test and standard samples
are dried out at the temperature of about 180 °C under a vacuum
environment to ensure the complete evacuation of all the pores.
The samples are then immersed in the working fluid, say octane,
under a vacuum environment for 15 min, and all the pores within
them  are  filled  with  the  working  fluid.  As  shown  schematically
in Fig. 9 , the test sample is then sandwiched between the stan-
dard samples. According to the capillary equilibrium, the samples
will have the same capillary potentials; the capillary pressure of
the  test  sample  will  be  equal  to  those  of  the  standard  samples.
Hence, any variation in the capillary pressure of the samples, say
due to evaporation of the working fluid, will affect both the tested
and standard samples. The amount of saturation can be measured
through sequential weight measurements, and the capillary pres-
sure  curve  of  the  test  sample  can  be  generated  by  utilizing  the
known capillary pressure curves of the standard samples. As dis-
played  in  Fig.  9 ,  the  procedure  followed  to  obtain  the  capillary
pressure versus saturation curve for a porous media has three steps
[24] :

Step #1: The respective saturation level of each sample is ob-
tained by weighing the test and standard samples individually at

regular  time  intervals.  Because  the  capillary  pressure  curve  for
each individual standard sample is known prior to the measure-
ments, the capillary pressure curves can be generated by utilizing
the information of evaporation.

Step #2: The capillary pressure of the test sample is determined
under the assumption that all samples have the same capillary po-
tentials – the capillary pressure of the test sample is equal to those
of the standards.

Step #3: Lastly, the first two steps are repeated for each evapo-

ration point until the sample is free of the working fluid.

2.2.2.1.2.  Mercury  intrusion  porosimetry .  Mercury  intrusion
porosimetry (MIP) is a destructive but simple-to-perform method
and  allows  characterization  of  a  porous  medium  that  contains
pores  in  the  range  of  3 nm–100 μm  [124] .  Similar  to  MSP,  the
MIP is used to obtain information about pore characteristics, such
as  porosity,  specific  pore  volume,  spatial  pore  size  distribution,
and pore connectivity [118,128] . As the name implies, mercury is
used as the working fluid, since it has distinctively high surface
tension ( σ = 486.5 mN m −1 ), it is non-wetting fluid for most sur-
faces [68] . This property of mercury makes the method applicable
for porous mediums containing both hydrophobic and hydrophilic
pores. MIP utilizes the magnitude of the pressure required to over-
come  the  surface  tension  to  determine  the  pore  characteristics.
Prior  to  the  measurements,  the  test-of-interest  sample  is  placed
in a glass tube, from which air is removed to guarantee that all
the  pores  within  the  sample  are  completely  evacuated.  Mercury
is then introduced into the glass tube at ambient pressure. Since
no pressure is applied, there is no liquid inside the pores of the
sample prior to the experiment. MIP is carried out by following a
five-step procedure: (i) increasing the pressure progressively from
ambient, (ii) allowing the system to reach equilibrium, (iii) deter-
mining  the  volume  of  the  mercury  that  migrated  into  the  sam-
ple during the first step, (iv) repeating the first three steps until
the maximum possible pressure is achieved, and finally (v) decre-
menting the pressure gradually back to ambient [124] . A curve that
correlates the imposed pressure with the injected mercury volume
is thus obtained. This correlation can then be converted into pore
size distribution using the equation given below [124] :

r

f = − 2 γ cosθ
p l
f  represents  the  hydrostatic  pressure  of  the  mercury,  γ
where  p l
stands for the surface tension,  and θ denotes the contact  angle.
This correlation is derived with the assumption that a porous ma-
terial is comprised of long cylindrical pores, and thus it omits the

dependency of surface tension and contact angle on pore size dis-
tribution, in turn leading to a hysteresis between the mercury in-
trusion and extrusion curves [124] . The back streaming of the ex-
truded mercury is the main drawback of this method, preventing
accurate detection of the pore characteristics of porous materials
with small pore sizes [120] .

2.2.2.1.3. Capillary flow porometry .  Capillary flow porometry  is
based on a principle similar to that of mercury intrusion porosime-
try  (MIP).  However,  unlike  MIP,  it  is  a  non-destructive  and  rel-
atively  faster  method  and  uses  a  wetting  fluid.  The  selection  of
the  working  fluid  should  be  made  with  careful  consideration  of
the specifications of the porous material under investigation. For
example, octane, as a fully wetting fluid, provides the capability
to determine the pore characteristics of the materials containing
both hydrophobic and hydrophilic pores, whereas water can give
only reasonable results for materials containing hydrophilic pores.
Prior to measurements, the test-of-interest porous sample is held
under a vacuum environment to ensure that all pores within the
sample are completely evacuated. The sample is then immersed in
a  wetting  fluid  under  a  vacuum  environment  until  all  pores  are
thoroughly filled with the working fluid. In the measurements, the
porous sample is weighed before and after soaking in the working
fluid to determine its bulk density. Once the pores of the sample
are  completely  filled  with  the  working  fluid,  the  sample  is  sub-
jected to a non-reacting and pressurised gas to sweep the liquid
away  from  the  pores.  The  pressure  of  the  gas  required  to  com-
pletely remove the fluid from the pores is utilized to determine
the pore diameter within the sample, as follows [68] :

D =

4 γ cosθ
P

(6)

where D is the pore diameter, γ is the surface tension of the work-
ing  fluid,  θ is  the  contact  angle  of  the  working  fluid,  and  P  is
the pressure difference between the non-reacting gas and working
fluid. The pore size distribution function can also be determined
from the change of the flow rate with the differential pressure in

the through-plane direction, as follows [68] :

(cid:3)
(cid:2)
(cid:5) F w
100
F
d
(cid:5)D

f = −

(7)

where f is the pore size distribution function, F w is the flow rate
of the wet gas, and F
d is the flow rate of the dry gas. The negative
sign appears because a decreasing pore size leads to an increased
flow rate [129] .

2.2.2.1.4. Water intrusion porosimetry . The method of water in-
trusion  porosimetry  relies  on  the  same  principle  as  MIP.  How-
ever,  it  represents  an  opportunity  to  conduct  experiments  with
a  non-toxic  working  fluid  (water)  and  a  lower  imposition  pres-
sure. Conducting experiments with water provides numerous co-
benefits,  such  as  low  risk  of  sample  damage  and  less-complex
equipment requirements [68] . However, the low surface tension of
water makes the method unsuitable for the characterization of hy-
drophobic pores. Water intrusion porosimetry has been previously
used  to  describe  the  water  management  capabilities  of  various
GDLs [130] . Results obtained via this method can also be combined
with those obtained via mercury and capillary flow porosimetry to
determine the ratio of hydrophobic pores over hydrophilic pores,
and hence wettability characteristics [82] .

The basic concept behind water intrusion porosimetry is that
the test-of-interest sample is situated between hydrophilic and hy-
drophobic membranes, and water is supplied and removed through
the  hydrophilic  membrane  while  a  pressurized  gas  is  supplied
from the hydrophobic side. The pressure level of the water is ad-
justed  so  that  the  hydrophilic  membrane  is  full  of  water,  while
the hydrophobic one is completely empty. The capillary pressure
curve of the sample is then generated by utilizing the pressure im-
plemented and the volume of water injected into the hydrophilic
membrane.

2.2.3. Effective electrical conductivity

In PEM fuel cells, electrons are generated within the anode cat-
alyst layer and then transported successively through each individ-

ual constituent in the anode and cathode electrodes – specifically,
electrons  travel  through  all  the  constituents,  except  the  electron
insulator  membrane.  However,  protons  are  generated  within  the
anode catalyst layer and then transported through the electrolyte
membrane  to  reach  the  cathode  catalyst  layer.  Thus,  fuel  cells
should be specifically engineered to eliminate the “ohmic losses”
associated  with  the  transport  of  electrons  and  protons  flowing
through the above-described routes [131] . The ohmic losses rep-
resent the combination of the internal resistances of the cell con-
stituents  and  the  interfacial  resistances  when  these  constituents
are in contact.

The internal resistances, as the name implies, are directly re-
lated to the inherent characteristics of the cell constituents. Thick-
ness,  morphology,  uniformity,  hydrophobic  treatment,  and  pore
characteristics  are  the  critical  parameters  affecting  GDL  inherent
characteristics, and hence internal resistance. The interfacial resis-
tances, however, occur due to the differences in the morphological,
structural, physical, and chemical properties of the cell constituents
that are in contact. The interface between the catalyst layer and
GDL can be given as a good example. The catalyst layer is com-
posed of catalyst nanoparticles supported on relatively larger car-
bon particles that are surrounded by an ionomer, whereas the GDL
is comprised of carbon fibers that are mechanically and chemically
bound to each other. When these morphologically and structurally
dissimilar constituents are in contact, a transition region reason-
ably  forms,  through  which  electron  transport  is  not  continuous,
due to the complexity of the electrically conductive pathways, and
hence the electrical resistance is distinctively high. A similar sce-
nario is also valid for the interface at the catalyst layer/membrane,
as both are specifically designed to yield a high ionic conductivity,
but  the  ionomer  inside  the  catalyst  layer,  unlike  the  membrane,
is purposely designed to be gas permeable so as to function rea-
sonably. The differences in their functions, and hence morphologi-
cal and structural characteristics, inevitably create an interface be-
tween the catalyst layer and membrane, where the resistance in-
creases substantially [24] . However, this phenomenon falls outside
the scope of this review and will not be further discussed here.

As mentioned, one of the critical functions of GDLs is to pro-
vide  a  platform  for  effective  electron  transport  between  catalyst
layers and flow-field plates and vice versa, implying that both of
them must ensure high electrical conductivity. As noted, the GDL
inherently  yields  significant  structural  differences  in  the  in-  and
through-plane directions; thus, its electron transport capabilities in
these directions show noticeable differences such that the in-plane
electrical conductivity could be higher by an order of magnitude
than the through-plane electrical conductivity [132] . The MPS (the
sublayer of the GDL) is principally composed of vertically stacked
carbon fiber sheets bound to each other, and each individual sheet
consists of anisotropically oriented fibers; such a structure reason-
ably offers more direct pathways for electron transport in the in-
plane direction [133] . However, even in the in-plane direction, the
fibers are preferentially aligned in a specific direction, making the
structure  rather  anisotropic.  The  electron  transport  capability  of
the MPS thus exhibits noticeable differences in the in-plane direc-
tion as well. These differences are closely linked to the orientation
of the fibers, such that the conductivity obtained from a reference
direction can differ by a factor of around two in the perpendicu-
lar direction [132,134] . On the other hand, the previously discussed
conductivity differences in the in- and through-plane directions are
strongly related to the interfacial (contact) resistance. The through-
plane electrical conductivity measurements are typically conducted
while the MPS sample is under compression; therefore, the resis-
tance recorded captures the contributions from both the bulk and
contact  resistances  [135,136] .  The  contact  resistance  makes  up  a
substantially large fraction of the recorded resistance and is known
to have a clear relationship with the content of the hydrophobic

agent  in  the  carbon  matrix.  The  contact,  and  thus  the  through-
plane electrical resistance, increases with rising hydrophobic agent
content.  However,  since  measurements  in  the  in-plane  direction
are  independent  of  contact  resistance  and  the  carbon-fiber  net-
work in the in-plane direction does not change upon hydropho-
bic treatment, the electron transport capability of the MPS in this
direction remains almost constant, regardless of the hydrophobic
agent loading. Herein, the MPL deposition onto the surface of the
MPS is useful in reducing the contact resistance or increasing the
through-plane electrical conductivity, because relatively high com-
pressibility of the MPL facilitates filling of the macro-scale spaces
between the MPS and flow-field plate [132] .

The deposition of the MPL onto the MPS may also influence the
electron transport in the in-plane direction; however, this trans-
port is closely related to the MPL design parameters, as well as the
resulting structure achieved upon MPL deposition. For example, the
type of carbon powder making up the MPL significantly influences
the electron transport capabilities of the resulting GDL. Thus, if the
electrical  conductivity  of  the  carbon  powder  employed  is  higher
than that of the carbon fibers, the resulting electrical conductiv-
ity of the GDL will be correspondingly higher than that of pristine
MPS.  The  carbon  powder  particle  size  also  influences  the  pene-
tration behavior of the MPL. For instance, when it is significantly
small,  the  MPL  is  more  likely  to  penetrate  deeply  into  the  MPS
and form a composite-like architecture. In some cases, intrusion of
the carbon particle/hydrophobic agent agglomerates into the MPS
can  build  up  more  direct  and  additional  electron-carrying  path-
ways between the carbon fibers, significantly unifying the electri-
cal conductivity characteristics in both the in- and through-plane
directions [53] .

On  the  basis  of  the  above  discussion,  the  electron  transport
within the GDL depends markedly on its morphological and mi-
crostructural characteristics; any direction-dependent variation in
these characteristics will substantially affect its electron transport
capabilities. Thus, the electrical conductivities (or electrical resis-
tances)  of  GDLs  reported  in  the  open  literature  show  great  dif-
ferences, mainly depending on the compositions of GDLs as well
as the conditions under which the electrical conductivity measure-
ments are conducted. Table 2 summarizes the electrical properties
of GDLs in the in- and through-plane directions, along with the
specifications  of  the  experimental  techniques  used  for  the  mea-
surements. Optimization of the electron transport in PEM fuel cells
requires a thorough understanding of the electron transport capa-
bilities of GDLs, which is acquired through accurate measurement
of electrical conductivities in the in- and through-plane directions.
The following subsections are therefore devoted to reviewing the
most frequently used techniques and tools for electrical conductiv-
ity measurements.

2.2.3.1. Techniques for electrical conductivity measurement
2.2.3.1.1 . Through-plane  electrical  conductivity .  The  through-plane
electrical conductivity of GDL, as discussed in [132] , can be mea-
sured by an experimental apparatus whose measurement principle
is quite similar to four-probe technique, which was originally de-
veloped  for  in-plane  electrical  conductivity  measurements.  How-
ever, unlike in-plane electrical conductivity measurements, in this
method, a disk-like sample (10 mm in diameter) extracted from a
test-of-interest porous medium is sandwiched between two highly
conductive stainless steel discs (10 mm in diameter). This config-
uration is akin to the placement of the GDL in actual cell opera-
tion. The test sample and steel discs all are then sandwiched be-
tween two copper electrodes mounted on insulator plates. The bolt
on  the  top  insulator  plate  provides  the  flexibility  of  conducting
the experiments under different clam ping pressures. The measure-
ment with the setup involves applying a direct current between
the top and under sides of the sample through copper electrodes

resistivity can be utilized to calculate the electrical conductivity of
the sample ( σ GDL ) , as follows [132] :

σGDL =

(13)

To eliminate the error associated with the direction-dependent
differences  in  the  in-plane  electrical  conductivity,  the  measure-
ments should be conducted with multiple samples extracted from
the GDL bench in different directions [132] .

2.2.4. Effective thermal conductivity

As a consequence of electrochemical reactions and related ir-
reversibilities, a PEM fuel cell generates a substantial amount of
heat that spreads through the constituents, giving rise to a signif-
icant temperature gradient across the cell [139] . Temperature gra-
dient is a critical parameter and simultaneously impacts both wa-
ter and heat transport mechanisms, and hence the durability and
longevity of cell constituents [140,141] . The temperature distribu-
tion  is  closely  related  to  several  transport  mechanisms,  such  as
water and species transport, the rate of water phase change, and
electrochemical reaction kinetics [142] . Effective heat management
is therefore a critical goal to be achieved for the manufactured of
fuel cells with high efficiency, durability, and stability, which can
be  acquired  through  effective  excess  heat  removal  from  the  cell
and requires the development and implementation of sound cool-
ing strategies. The effectiveness of these strategies hinges on con-
current consideration of heat and water management phenomena
[143] . This fact is paramount specifically when the amount of la-
tent heat released or absorbed due to the condensation and evap-
oration  of  water  is  considered  [144] .  This  is  particularly  reason-
able, when considering that the temperature and pressure gradi-
ents trigger formation of vapor-phase diffusive flux, and that the
water in the vapor phase involves the latent heat of evaporation,
leading to heat (energy) delivery. This mechanism starts initially
through  water  evaporation  at  relatively  hotter  regions,  proceeds
through water vapor diffusion through the void regions, and ends
with  water  condensation  at  relatively  cooler  regions  [145] .  This
heat transfer mechanism is generally referred to as heat pipe effect
[145] ;  and  there  exists  studies  experimentally  investigating  this
heat transfer mechanism in GDLs with different wettability char-
acteristics; for example, see Ref. [145] .

Thermal analyses are key tools used to glean insights into the
thermal-related  mechanisms  that  trigger  hydro-thermal  stresses
and degradations in cell constituents [146] . Since temperature dis-
tribution is a strong function of the cell constituents’ thermal con-
ductivities, a detailed thermal analysis of a fuel cell must include
accurate knowledge of the thermal conductivity of the catalyst lay-
ers,  electrolyte  membrane,  and  particularly  the  GDL  [71,147,148] .
The  thermal  conductivity  of  the  porous  materials  is  generally
represented  by  the  “effective  thermal  conductivity” – a  thermo-
physical property that captures the contribution of each species to
thermal  conductivity  [149] .  In  theory,  the  effective  thermal  con-
ductivity of the GDL is a simple function of porosity and the ther-
mal conductivities of the solid (carbon fibers) and fluid (air/water)
phases.  However,  the  fairly  complex  and  anisotropic  microstruc-
ture of the GDL and the noticeable differences in the thermal con-
ductivities of the solid and fluid phases make the determination
of effective thermal conductivity fairly challenging [150,151] . Fur-
ther, heat transfer within the GDL involves several complex mech-
anisms  occurring  simultaneously,  such  as  heat  transfer  through
solid phase; heat transfer through fluid phase; and heat transfer
between  interconnected  fibers,  making  the  heat  transfer  process
dauntingly complex. Thus, a vast majority of thermal analyses have
been greatly simplified and restricted to simple model representa-
tions. In many analyses, thermal conductivity has been predicted
by combining series and parallel models and/or by taking the mean

resistance between the GDL sample and steel disc can be expressed
as [132] :
(cid:4)
R GDL −s =

ov erall − R a − R s − R GDL
R
2

(10)

(cid:5)

where  R
overall  and  R a  are  the  previously  determined  quantities,
while R s can be calculated by using the thickness and bulk resis-
tance of the stainless steel disc. However, as recommended in Ref.
[132] , the resistance of the GDL sample can be calculated by uti-
lizing its resistivity. Since the volume of the porous GDL sample is
comprised of void and solid regions, its bulk resistivity can be es-
timated by utilizing the volume fraction of each region and their
respective resistivities [132,137] :

1

ρGDL =

(11)

( ε/ ρair ) + ( ( 1 − ε ) / ρ

solid )
where  ρGDL  is  the  bulk  resistivity  of  the  GDL  sample,  ε is  the
porosity  of  the  GDL  sample  (ratio  of  void  region  over  cumula-
tive volume), ρ
air  is the resistivity of air, and ρ
solid  is the resis-
tivity of the carbon fibers. The resistivity of carbon fiber is around
4.02 × 10 −5 (cid:6) m [132] . Also, the first term in the denominator may
be neglected with the assumption that air has extremely high re-
sistivity. The resistivity of the sample can then be multiplied by its
thickness to calculate the bulk resistance.

2.2.3.1.2.  In-plane  electrical  conductivity .  The  in-plane  electri-
cal conductivity of the GDL can be determined by the four-probe
method [138] , along with a correlation that involves a geometry-
dependent correction term, whose value depends on the distance
maintained  between  the  probes  and  the  dimensions  of  the  test
sample.  As  discussed  in  detail  in  [132] ,  prior  to  measurements,
the GDL sample is mounted on an insulator plate, and electrodes
made of copper are attached to each end of the sample. In a typi-
cal measurement, as schematically presented in Fig. 11 , the current
supplied from the copper electrodes flows through the GDL sam-
ple, and the corresponding voltage between the two inner probes
is measured. The resistance of the path between the inner probes
can then be calculated according to Ohm’s Law. The resistivity of
the GDL sample ( ρ
GDL ) can also be calculated by the linear corre-
lation, as follows [132] :
ρGDL = CtR

(12)

where C is the geometry-dependent correction factor, t is the thick-
ness of the GDL sample, and R is the resistance calculated. The in-
verse proportion between the electrical conductivity and electrical

geometric average of the thermal conductivities of solid and liquid
phases; for example, see Refs. [152,153] .

Only a few modeling studies have considered the thermal con-
ductivity of the GDL as anisotropic and parametrically investigated
its impact on polarization behavior under different operating con-
ditions [154–156] . The parametric investigations have revealed that
operating conditions, i.e. , temperature and pressure, substantially
influence the expectations about GDLs in terms of thermal conduc-
tivity. In another study, Zamel et al. [149] numerically estimated
the impacts of GDL parameters, such as porosity, fiber distribution,
and compression, on the effective thermal conductivity of the GDL.
It  was  found  that  the  effective  thermal  conductivity  is  a  strong
function of porosity and compression, such that it increases with
decreasing porosity and increasing compression. It has also been
reported that embedding supportive carbon fibers in the through-
plane direction of the GDL significantly increases thermal conduc-
tivity in this direction. In another study, an interesting GDL design
has been proposed to reduce performance losses under dry con-
ditions associated with membrane dehydration, such that the GDL
specifically designed to possess gradually decreasing through-plane
thermal conductivity farther away from the cell inlet [155] . In an-
other study, a statistical unit cell model, which considers geomet-
rical parameters ( i.e. , angle distribution and aspect ratio) together
with porosity, has been developed to explicitly estimate the ther-
mal conductivity of GDLs. This study demonstrated that geometri-
cal parameters, i.e. , angle distribution and aspect ratio, are as im-
portant as porosity in determining heat transfer through conduc-
tion. It was also noted that a porous medium with a higher poros-
ity provides a lower thermal conductivity, and that porous samples
with the same porosity but different aspect ratios can yield com-
pletely different thermal conductivities, implying that geometrical
parameters significantly influence heat transfer in the GDL. Also,
maximum thermal conductivity has been found to be a function
only of porosity and fiber angle, rather than fiber diameter and as-
pect ratio [156] .

As more complex and realistic models being developed, addi-
tional  parameters,  including  the  material  characteristics  of  solid
phase; shape, size and size distribution of pores; and properties
and phase of fluids, have been incorporated into analyses to in-
vestigate their effects on heat transfer phenomena [151] . Of these
parameters, pore characteristics came into particular prominence
after  two  critical  heat-transfer  driven  mechanisms  – convection
and  radiation  – were  proven  to  be  closely  related  to  pore  size
distribution [151] . Convection heat transfer, which occurs as fluid
phase  experiences  intensive  circulation,  has  been  shown  to  be-
come more dominant through pores larger than 100 μm but less
dominant through those smaller than 100 μm [157] . Further, this
transfer  mechanism  has  been  confirmed  to  effectively  occur  at
temperatures larger than 100 °C – temperatures noticeably larger
than the regular PEM fuel cell operation temperatures (70–75 °C)
[158] . Radiation heat transfer, however, has been found to occur as
heat is emitted by the walls of pores, requiring high temperatures
( > 600 °C) unlikely to be encountered in PEM fuel cell operation.
Therefore, radiation heat transfer has been generally neglected in
thermal analyses of PEM fuel cells and given special consideration
in those of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), whose operating tempera-
ture is relatively higher (60 0–10 0 0 °C) [159,160] . Because the tem-
peratures at which these two mechanisms function well are dis-
tinctively  higher  than  the  regular  operating  temperature  of  PEM
fuel  cells,  heat  transfer  in  the  GDL  of  a  PEM  fuel  cell  depends
strongly on conduction, rather than convection and radiation. As
well  as  modeling  studies,  there  have  also  been  critical  advance-
ments in experimental approaches for the ex-situ thermal charac-
terization of GDLs, as will be discussed in the following subsection.
As discussed earlier, the effective thermal conductivity coefficients
in both the in- and through-plane directions can show clear dif-

ferences, depending on the microstructural characteristics of GDLs,
such as porosity, pore size distribution, fiber diameter, and aspect
ratio. The GDLs’ microstructural characteristics can in turn show
differences, depending on their compositions as well as manufac-
turing techniques. Table 3 presents the effective thermal conduc-
tivity values obtained for GDLs with different properties through
ex-situ characterizations.

2.2.4.1.1 . Steady-state methods

2.2.4.1.1.1. Through-plane thermal conductivity . The through-plane
thermal conductivity as well as thermal contact resistance of thin
films  can  be  measured  by  the  guarded  heat  flux  meter  – a  de-
vice compatible with the ASTM standard [112,162] . The measure-
ments with this device, as schematically described in Fig. 12 , in-
volve  sandwiching  a  disk-like  specimen  between  two  cylindrical
rods – the top rod is connected to the hot plate, while the bot-
tom one is in contact with the cold plate [24] . The cylindrical rods
are made of highly conductive material (aluminum bronze) with a
known thermal conductivity. The temperature difference between
the top and bottom rods creates a heat flux in the axial direction
of  the  cylinders  from  top  to  bottom,  as  the  apparatus  is  specif-
ically  engineered  to  allow  heat  transfer  only  in  one  dimension.
The heat flux generates a temperature gradient along the cylinder
away from the top plate – the temperature differences across the
rods  are  then  measured  with  a  set  of  thermocouples  positioned
on roads with the same intervals [24] . Prior to experimentation,
the whole system should reach steady state – an ideal steady-state
condition is said to be achieved once the temperature fluctuation
at each measurement point is less than 0.5 °C over a sufficiently
long period, say 30 min [164] . Once the steady state is achieved,
the temperatures measured from the measurement points are uti-
lized to generate temperature distribution curve along the roads.
The  heat  flux  through  the  roads  can  be  determined  by  utilizing
the temperature differences between the measurement points, to-
gether with accurate knowledge of thermal conductivity and cross-
sectional area of the rods, as follows [24] :

Q = −k ( T ) A r

dT
dx

(14)

where Q is the heat flux, k ( T ) is the thermal conductivity of the
roads, A r is the crosssectional area of the roads, and  dT
dx  is the tem-
perature gradient. The total thermal resistance across the specimen
( R t )  can  be  calculated  by  utilizing  the  known  heat  flux  ( Q )  and
temperature drop along the specimen ( (cid:5)T s ), as follows [24] :

R t =

(cid:5)T s
Q

(15)

(16)

where the total thermal resistance ( R t ) captures the contributions
from the thermal resistance of the specimen ( R s ) and the thermal
contact resistances between the specimen and the top and bottom
rods ( R c ) , as expressed in [24] :
R t = R s + 2 R c
where R s = f ( k s , A c , P c ) and R c = f ( k s , k
flux , P c ) are highly and intri-
cately correlated to the thermal conductivity, crosssectional area,
and contact pressure [24] . The thermal contact resistance ( R c ) is
also a function of the surface characteristics of both the specimen
and rods. Thus, it is fairly complicated to determine both through a
single measurement. Conducting several experiments with a stack
of specimens (composed of one, two, and three layers of test speci-
mens) could be a potential approach to estimate the thermal resis-
tance of the specimen, as well as the thermal contact resistance
[24] .  Since  the  contact  resistance  will  remain  virtually  constant
during successive measurements, a linear correlation relating the
measured thermal resistance to the number of layers could be es-
tablished to predict the thermal resistance of the specimen, as well

relation can then be utilized to estimate the thermal conductivity
of the specimen ( k s ) [24] :

More recently, another steady-state method has been developed
to investigate the change in the through-plane thermal conductiv-
ities of GDLs with altering saturation level under various mechan-
ical compressions [33] . The experimental apparatus, schematically
described in Fig. 13 , has two steel cylinders to keep the sample un-
der compression. The setup is capable of determining the stress-
strain  relation.  A  spiral  shape  transient  plane  source  (TPS)  sen-
sor is equipped with a setup to record the time-dependent rise in
temperature while minimizing undesired water vaporization. The
measurements are carried out with two disk-like samples (53 mm
in diameter). The samples are compressed between the two steel
discs. The compression leads to a substantial decrease in the poros-
ity of the samples. Porosity is a key parameter to be determined as

a function of compression, since it provides information about sat-
uration of the samples [33] . The correlation that relates porosity
with compression is shown below [33] :

∗ = 1 −

(cid:4)

(cid:5)
1 − ∅

(18)

where ∅ ∗ is the compressed porosity of the samples, ∅ is the un-
compressed (or initial) porosity of the samples, and ε is the total
strain on the compressed sample. Prior to measurements, the un-
saturated weight and thickness of the samples are measured. The
samples are then artificially saturated by soaking them in deion-
ized (DI) water under a vacuum environment. A sonic bath is also
employed during the immersion and saturation processes, to re-
move  any  remaining  bubbles  from  the  samples  [166] .  The  com-
pressed thickness of the samples can be calculated as follows [33] :

where l is the compressed thickness of the sample, l o  is the un-
compressed (or initial) thickness of the sample, ε is the total strain
on  the  compressed  sample,  and εo  is  the  strain  on  the  uncom-
pressed (or initial) sample. In the measurements, the samples are
first fully saturated and then allowed to vaporize until the desired
level of saturation is achieved. The saturated weight of the com-
pressed sample can be calculated as follows [33] :

m wet = m

saturation due to compression can be found by [33] ,

To  ensure  steady-state  conditions,  each  measurement  is
recorded after approximately 30 min of pre-testing time. Overall,
this  newly  introduced  method  allows  determination  of  through-
plane thermal conductivity of GDLs as a function of compression
and saturation [33] – which could be particularly useful for un-
derstanding the thermal transport phenomena in an operating cell
and providing experimental data for modellers.

2.2.4.1.1.2.  In-plane  thermal  conductivity .  The  in-plane  thermal
conductivity measurements of GDLs rely on more compelling pro-
cedures, with respect to through-plane measurements. Two steady-
state methods have been developed for the measurement of the
in-plane  thermal  conductivity  of  porous  materials  [150,167] .  The
experimental apparatus employed by Sadeghi et al. [150] is quite
similar in terms of construction to the one discussed in the pre-
vious subsection for the through-plane thermal conductivity mea-
surements.  As  schematically  illustrated  in  Fig.  14 ,  the  measure-
ments  involve  mounting  two  pieces  of  specimen  on  the  sample
holders by their ends and creating a heat flux from the top-left
side to the bottom-right side of the apparatus [150] . Placing the
experimental apparatus inside a vacuum chamber is a critical step
in allowing solely one-dimensional heat transfer through the axis
of the upper and lower fluxmeters [150] . With the assumption that
heat transfer occurs purely through conduction, the heat flux from
the  upper  fluxmeter  to  the  lower  one  can  be  expressed  accord-

butions from (i) the low conductivity material, thermocouple and
heater wires, and (ii) radiation to the surrounding. Since the exper-
imental setup is situated inside a vacuum chamber, the effect of
natural convection can be neglected. Next, the previously followed
procedures are repeated while the test sample is situated between
the two ends of the horizontal sample holder, and the distance be-
tween the two edges of the sample is measured to determine the
length of the heat transfer pathway. The thermal resistance for the
second measurement ( R ) can be calculated by utilizing the temper-
atures measured at the edges of the horizontal sample holder and
the current and voltage applied to the heater. The thermal resis-
tance recorded for the second measurement can be expressed by

a slight heat loss was detected from the upper fluxmeter to the
wooden  insulator.  Similar  to  the  approach  used  in  the  through-

The second steady-state technique, known as parallel thermal
conductance  (PTC)  method,  was  originally  developed  by  Aaron
et al. [169] to measure the thermal conductivity of single crystals
and then adopted by Teertstra et al. [167] for the in-plane ther-
mal conductivity measurements of GDLs. In the measurements, as
schematically illustrated in Fig. 15 , two layers made of a low con-
ductivity material are placed between the ends of the vertical sam-
ple holder, and the heater is set to a steady-state temperature by
arranging the voltage of the direct current supply. The temperature
of the base plate is also kept at a constant and cooler temperature.
Upon reaching steady state, the data for both the applied current
and  voltage  to  the  heater  and  thermocouple  recordings  are  col-
lected, which typically requires 2–3 h. The collected data are then
utilized to determine the thermal resistance between the two ends
of the sample holder ( R o ) [167] :

can be calculated as follows [167] :

The second steady-state technique offers an advantage of fast
data collection, because it involves only two consecutive simple-
to-perform steps. Since the measurements can be conducted with
a single sample, the time for sample preparation is relatively short.
Moreover, the technique provides high measurement accuracy such
that the measurements can be conducted without the need of fur-
ther assumption or measurement for thermal contact resistances
[167] .

2.2.4.1.2. Quasi-state techniques
2.2.4.1.2.1. Through-plane thermal conductivity . One of the practi-
cal quasi-steady techniques used to investigate the through-plane
thermal conductivity of GDLs is the slug calorimeter method, es-
sentially developed to measure the thermal conductivity of fiber
insulation materials and later adopted for the thermal conductivity
measurements of GDLs [170,171] . The method relies on the prin-
ciple of monotonous heating and offers the benefit of being able
to measure materials of different geometries. The slug calorime-
ter also provides enough flexibility to carry out the experiments
over a wide temperature range, say from −50 °C to 120 °C, which
substantially reduces the time for data collection. In fact, measure-
ments that would require up to weeks using steady-state meth-
ods can be successfully completed in 1–2 h [171] . As schematically
shown in Fig. 16 , in this method, two pieces of test sample are
in direct contact with a heat source and a slug. The slug is made
of a highly thermally conductive material, typically steel. Because
the samples are exposed to continuous heating, a heat flux passes
through them and enters the slug, raising the temperature of the
slug. This temperature increase is controlled by three parameters,
namely: the mass and heat capacity of the slug and the heat flux
entering the slug’s boundaries. Therefore, the slug literally serves
as a “flux-gauging instrument” and hence allows for precise esti-
mation of the thermal conductivities of the samples. Further infor-
mation on the slug calorimeter method can be found in Ref. [24] .
2.2.4.1.2.2. In-plane thermal conductivity . The monotonous heat-
ing method was specifically developed to determine the in-plane
thermal  conductivity  of  GDLs  by  measuring  their  thermal  diffu-
sivity  in  a  monotonous  heating  regime.  This  regime  is  best  de-
scribed as a process of either heating or cooling when tempera-
ture variation throughout the specimen is virtually uniform [172] .

ductivity measurements of porous materials, adapted from [171] .

The regime is a generalized form of the “theory of quasi-state con-
ditions” for scenarios, in which the heating rate is constant and
physical  characteristics  of  the  specimen  demonstrate  no  depen-
dence on temperature and no internal heat source [172] . In other
words, the rate of temperature increase is constant and almost the
same  in  all  locations  inside  the  test  specimen.  The  method  en-
ables the measurement of porous materials’ thermal properties at
a broad range of temperature without the need for any assump-
tion pertaining to the linearity of the thermal conduction correla-
tion [171] . In this technique, as described in Ref. [71] , the thermal
diffusivity measurements are conducted with a multi-layer speci-
men comprised of several layers of samples with identical porous
structures. The thermocouples are situated between the layers of
the specimen through the center axis in the through-plane direc-
tion. The specimen is fixed by its two ends between two plates
made of a thermally conductive material. The outer surface of the
specimen is insulated to ensure that heat transfer occurs solely in
the in-plane direction. The physical model of the heat transfer in
the monotonous heating regime has been previously described for
a square by Zamel et al. [71] . As schematically illustrated in Fig. 17 ,
a temperature field [ T ( x = 0, t )] through the entire sample is devel-
oped with constant properties ( i.e. , heating rate) according to the
non-linear correlation of thermal conduction, and the decrease in
temperature away from the base section is θ ( x, t ) = [ T ( x
1 , t ) − T (0,
t )]. The governing equation for these conditions can be expressed
as follows [71] :

2.2.5. Effective diffusion coefficient

As  PEM  fuel  cells  have  been  progressively  designed  to  en-
sure trouble-free performance at high current densities, develop-
ing strategies to surmount the performance decays associated with
mass transport limitations becomes more critical than ever [173] .
Accordingly,  there  has  been  a  significant  drive  in  the  fuel  cell
community to provide additional insights and gain a full under-
standing of the underlying causes of these so-called mass trans-
port limitations. The mass transport through the electrodes is pri-
marily  driven  by  two  well-established  mechanisms:  convection
due to pressure gradients and diffusion due to molecular motions
[174] . During cell operation, as the limiting current density is ap-
proached, concentration overpotential associated with the limited
transport of gaseous species ( i.e. , oxygen and hydrogen) through
the electrodes becomes more severe. Thus, relatively low diffusiv-
ity of oxygen makes the cathode electrode problematic in terms
of mass transfer limitations [175,176] . The pathway of oxygen from
the cathode flow channels to the electrochemical reaction region is
schematically illustrated in Fig. 18 . As detailed in Fig. 18 , oxygen is

cient by assuming that the effective transport properties are inter-
related and similar. Equation (35) suggests that the effective dif-
fusion  through  a  porous  medium  is  less  than  the  bulk  diffusion
coefficient resulting primarily from the presence of the solid re-
gion and the saturation of liquid water within the void region. It
is also seen that the difference between the effective diffusion and
its bulk counterpart is proportional to the porosity.

Similarly,  the  effective  medium  approximation has  been  used
to develop analytical correlations to estimate the effective diffu-
sion coefficient of an isotropic porous media composed of spherical
particles (see Eq. (36) ). However, none of these correlations took
the presence of liquid water inside the porous medium into con-
sideration. Later, this omission was addressed by Das et al. [183] ,
who developed a more-detailed correlation ( Eq. (37) ) to estimate
the  effective  diffusion  coefficient  through  an  isotropic  medium
made of spherical particles, by considering the presence of water.
The correlation enabled estimation of the effective diffusion coef-
ficients under flooding conditions – a relatively closer approxima-
tion  when  considering  the  transport  phenomena  during  cell  op-
eration.  Notwithstanding this  correlation  is relatively  more com-
prehensive, it still has some conceptual limitations. For instance, it
was derived with the assumption that a porous medium is made of
uniformly distributed spherical particles – a rather oversimplified
approach, particularly when considering that the true GDL struc-
ture is anisotropic and primarily comprised of cylindrical carbon
fibers. The percolation theory has also been used to develop a the-
oretical correlation that is more capable of estimating the effec-
tive diffusion through a porous medium composed of freely over-
lapping fibers oriented in different directions (see Eq. (38) ). This
correlation is relatively more detailed and advantageous in inves-
tigating the effect of dimensionality on a structure and Knudsen
number.

Even though the correlations discussed so far present several
clear differences, they were all derived with the assumption that a
porous medium has a rigid matrix, which is not completely true,
or at least does not represent the realistic structure of GDLs, thus
likely making the correlations somewhat incapable of explicitly es-
timating the diffusion coefficients. This hypothesis was later con-
firmed  through  simple  comparisons  made  between  theoretically
and experimentally obtained effective diffusion coefficients. Over-
all, these correlations were found to rely on far too simplified as-
sumptions  and  so  do  not  fully  represent  a  GDL’s  true  structure,
or the diffusional mass transport through it [180,186] . As is clear
from Table 4 , the theoretical derivations discussed so far depend
solely on the accurate knowledge of porosity, with the assumption
that porosity is a key indicator of the micro/nano structural char-
acteristics. This approach may be regarded as “narrow in scope”,
specifically  when  considering  the  criticality  of  other  parameters,
such as tortuosity, pore size distribution, and mean pore size. The
tortuosity  is  a  measure  of  the  complexity  of  the  diffusion  path;
consequently,  it  is  closely  linked  to  the  pattern  of  the  network
constructed by the interconnected pores inside a porous medium
[187] . Hence, it is virtually impossible to gain an accurate knowl-
edge regarding tortuosity without a three-dimensional (3D) real-
istic structure of the GDL. In this context, rigorous determination
of the pore size distribution and mean pore size of GDLs seems
to pave the way towards better understanding of their 3D struc-
ture. Given the limitations of conventional correlations, a shift to-
wards developing more-comprehensive models, which consider the
realistic pore structures of GDLs, provides an opportunity to esti-
mate the effective diffusion coefficients through them more pre-
cisely. With a clear representation of the actual structures of GDLs,
it  is  correspondingly  possible  to  determine  their  pore  character-
istics, and hence the effective diffusion coefficients through them
[188] .  Two  well-established  methods  can  be  used  to  reconstruct
the pore structure of porous media [189] : 3D volume imaging ( i.e. ,

first transported through the cathode GDL and MPL and then the
cathode catalyst layer – that is, the diffusion pathway is shrink-
ing along the diffusion direction. When oxygen reaches the three-
phase boundary, there are three significant barriers that decelerate
oxygen transport: a gas/ionomer interface, an ionomer film, and an
ionomer/catalyst interface [177–179] .

Diffusional gas transport makes up a large portion of the overall

mass transport and is generally represented by Fick’s law [180] :

regarded as an indicator of the flux of gaseous species through the
porous media and can be expressed as follows [24] :
i  = D bulk
D eff
where D bulk
is the bulk diffusion coefficient of the gaseous species,
and  s  is  the  liquid water  saturation  in porous  media.  Obviously,
the effective diffusion through the porous media is closely related
to its porosity and the liquid water saturation within its pores. The
diffusion-based gas-phase transport can also be broken down into
two elements: “Knudsen diffusion” and “bulk diffusion”. Either of
them can become dominant depending on the size of the pores
within the porous media – that is, the pore characteristics substan-
tially influence the mechanism by which diffusion is mainly gov-
erned. As such, any reduction in the porosity of the porous media,
say due to the hydrophobic treatment or MPL deposition, substan-
tially reduces the effective diffusion coefficient through it [12] .

(34)

Developing correlations to determine the effective diffusion co-
efficients  through  GDLs  according  to  a  comprehensive  criterion
has been a key challenge, but one essential to a full understand-
ing of the GDL’s capability in gas-phase transport. As summarized
in Table 4 , many correlations currently under consideration were
originally developed to estimate the various transport properties
of a general porous media composed of spherical particles. They
thus tend to provide inaccurate data for the effective diffusion co-
efficients  through  GDLs,  which  are  inherently  made  of  cylindri-
cal carbon fibers. For instance, the Bruggeman approximation ( Eq.
(35) )  was  initially  developed  to  predict  the  electrical  conductiv-
ity and dielectric constant of a porous medium comprised of ran-
domly distributed non-conducting spherical particles [181] . How-
ever, it was afterward used to predict the effective diffusion coeffi-

X-ray  computed  morphology  [190,191] )  and  stochastic  3D  recon-
struction [192–194] .

In 3D volume imaging, the porous medium is continuously sec-
tioned while capturing the two-dimensional images from its sur-
face.  The  collected  2D  images  are  then  combined  to  construct
the realistic 3D structure of the porous medium [24] . As a pop-
ular 3D volume imaging technique, X-ray macro-tomography with
a relatively limited resolution has been employed in reconstruct-
ing  the  3D  structure  of  the  MPS,  so  as  to  determine  the  effec-
tive diffusion coefficient  as  a  function of  liquid water  saturation
[195] . X-ray tomographic reconstruction of occupying water pro-
files  has  also  been  used  in  Lattice  Boltzmann  (LB)  simulations,
to explicitly determine the effective diffusion coefficients in par-
tially saturated MPSs [94,196] . Similarly, the water configurations
obtained  via  X-ray  tomographic  microscopy  has  been  utilized  to
verify the predictions made through three-dimensional volume-of-
fluid (VOF) method [102] – this enables fuel cell researchers to in-
vestigate the two-phase flow in MPSs efficiently [98] . Reconstruct-
ing the 3D structure of the MPS is possible with current state-of-
the-art X-ray facilities, but the equipment in use today does not
fully satisfy the visualization requirements needed for quantifica-
tion of the complex and random 3D structures achieved with MPL
deposition [188] . The cells employed in X-ray tomography experi-
ments are also limited by size and X-ray exposure time [97] . More-
over, the measurements through X-ray tomography require long-
lasting  sample  preparation  steps,  which  is  not  practically  viable
when considering the delicate architectures of GDLs. Thus, in an
attempt to eliminate the extensive sample preparation steps and
obtain the critical microstructural features from rather chaotic pore
spaces,  focused  ion  beam  scanning  electron  microscope  electron
microscopy (FIB-SEM) has also been utilized (see [197,198] , for ex-
ample).

On  the  other  hand,  in  stochastic  3D  reconstruction,  a  porous
medium is assumed to be macroscopically uniform or spatially sta-

tionary. That is, microstructural characteristics are independent of
the  location  from  which  the  sample  is  extracted  [199] .  The  3D
quantification  of  the  microstructure  is  obtained  from  either  3D
images  or  light  macroscopic  cross-sectional  views.  On  the  com-
pletion  of  image  acquisition,  the  model  is  constructed  by  fitting
model  parameters  accordingly.  The  parameters  should  be  deter-
mined in such a way that the characteristic features of the GDL, i.e. ,
porosity, pore size distribution, fiber diameter, fiber co-alignment,
fiber pitch and binder, and/or hydrophobic agent content, are rep-
resented  properly  [193,200–202] .  Zamel  et  al.  [185]  utilized  this
technique to predict the effective diffusion coefficient through car-
bon paper in the in- and through-plane directions. In their work,
the  structural  characteristics  of  the  carbon  paper  were  obtained
with  the  assumptions  that  the  carbon  fibers  are  cylindrical,  in-
finitely long, and have a constant diameter, and also that the fiber
system yields isotropic structural characteristics in the material di-
rection [185] . They estimated the effective diffusion coefficients as
an average quantity in three directions (x, y and z) by solving Fick’s
Law Eqs. (33) and ( (34) ) in the void region of the carbon paper and
obtaining the concentration gradient. By calculating the effective
diffusion coefficients in the in- and through-plane directions as a
function of porosity, they found that the Bruggeman approximation
( Eq. (35) ) does not fully represent the pore structure of the carbon
paper under investigation. In their study [185] , the correlation ( Eq.
(37) ) proposed by Das et al. [183] was also expanded on to develop
two  different  correlations  ( Eqs.  (40)  and  (41) )  for  through-  and
in-plane effective diffusion coefficients. The correlations were also
made sensitive to fiber orientation and geometry by incorporating
a factor referred to as the “geometry factor”. Stochastic 3D recon-
struction has also been used together with different mass diffusion
simulation methods, such as Lattice Boltzmann (LB) [95,203–206] ,
volume-of-liquid (VOF) [194,207] , direct simulation [208] , to accu-
rately predict the mass transport characteristics in GDLs of differ-
ent microstructures.

There have also been considerable efforts on the development
of  analytical  models  based  on  fractal  theory  (see  [175,209–211] ,
for example). This approach is meaningful, particularly when con-
sidering that a vast majority of natural pores demonstrate fractal-
like characteristics, and that fractal theory has been confirmed to
have a great capability towards quantitative description of porous
materials with complex and random structures. In most of these
models,  fractal  theory  has  been  utilized  to  determine  a  definite
relationship between the microstructural characteristics and diffu-
sivity. However, in many of them, porosity has been regarded as
a major contributor to the effective diffusion coefficient, and the
undeniable influence of pore size distribution has been somewhat
overlooked. This omission led to the estimation of a misleadingly
high effective diffusion coefficient for porous samples comprised
of  relatively  small  pores,  spanning  from  a  few  nanometers  to  a
few micrometers [212] . Hence, specifically for the porous materials
with a broad range of pore size distributions, the criticality of the
detailed GDL structure construction has been increasingly appreci-
ated. For such materials, even considering the influence of Knudsen
effect – an effective gas-diffusion mechanism through nano-scale
pores – on effective diffusivity is strongly suggested [210] . How-
ever,  in  only  a  few  fractal  models  [175,209,210] ,  their  criticality
has been taken into account. For example, Wu et al. [209] devel-
oped a fractal model that identifies the GDL structure according to
tortuosity and area fractal dimensions and considers the Knudsen
effect, to estimate the effective diffusivity of oxygen through the
GDL under dry and wet conditions. Their investigation highlighted
the criticality of the Knudsen diffusion effect in understanding oxy-
gen transport. Specifically under dry conditions, oxygen diffusivity
was shown to raise with increasing area fractal dimensions and de-
creasing tortuosity fractal dimensions; whereas under wet condi-
tions, the wettability characteristics of the GDL were found to be
a critical factor affecting oxygen diffusivity. In another study [210] ,
taking the Knudsen diffusion effect into account resulted in a rela-
tively smaller effective diffusion coefficient. The effective diffusivity
was also found to correlate positively with pore area fractal dimen-
sion and porosity, but negatively with tortuosity.

In summary, as we have seen, most of the models/correlations
developed to estimate the effective diffusion coefficients consider
only a few structural parameters under the conditions, and so do
not fully represent the diffusion phenomena during cell operation.
The main limitation related to these models therefore comes from
the fact that the fundamental diffusion phenomena remain poorly
understood. The pressing need for more reliable data has been the
primary  motivation  of  many  experimental  efforts  aimed  at  pre-
dicting the effective diffusion coefficients through GDLs more ac-
curately. Hence, the effective diffusion coefficients have also been
experimentally estimated via ex- and in-situ characterization tech-
niques, as will be discussed in the following subsection. Table 5
summarizes the effective diffusion coefficients for GDLs with dif-
ferent specifications obtained through these experimental charac-
terizations.

2.2.5.1. Techniques for effective diffusion coefficient measurement .  In
this section, an overview is provided for the common in- [97,214–
216] and ex-situ [12,180,217–219] techniques that have been used
to determine the effective diffusion coefficient through the GDL.

2.2.5.1.1. In-situ methods for effective diffusion coefficient measure-
ment. In-situ characterizations for the effective diffusion coefficient,
or  more  commonly  for  the  “oxygen  diffusion  resistance”,  in  the
presence of liquid water can be conducted through direct or in-
direct measurements. Indirect measurements can provide insights
into the underlying causes of mass transfer limitations, but they
cannot explicitly correlate mass transfer limitations with liquid wa-
ter saturation [97] . One such measurement is AC impedance spec-
troscopy [220] , which can also be coupled with visualization tech-

niques, specifically when quantification of liquid water saturation
is needed [221] . Direct measurements, however, rely on several dif-
ferent techniques and procedures and can provide more quantita-
tive results. Since the limiting current density is the representative
of the oxygen transport limitations, in most of these techniques,
the  cell  is  operated  at  the  limiting  current  density  under  either
dry or humidified conditions [222] . In principle, these techniques
can  provide  accurate  knowledge  about  the  contribution  of  each
cell  constituent  to  the  overall  oxygen-transport  resistance.  How-
ever, the measurement accuracy depends very much on the uni-
formity of the oxygen concentration along the cathode flow field;
thus,  measurements  are  generally  conducted  with  the  cells  hav-
ing small active areas at high reactant stoichiometries. The over-
all oxygen-transport resistance can be described as the change in
oxygen concentration from the cathode inlet to the electrochemi-
cal reaction region, divided by the mean molar flux of oxygen to
the electrochemical reaction region, which gives the following ex-
pression [223] :

where R o is the overall oxygen-transport resistance, (cid:5)c is the oxy-
gen concentration gradient from the flow field inlet to the cathode
electrode, N o is the molar flux of oxygen, F is the Faraday constant,
and i is the current density. When the limiting current density is
approached, the oxygen concentration at the electrochemical reac-
tion region becomes nearly zero, and thus the term representing
the concentration difference can be assumed to be equal to the in-
let oxygen concentration, which is in turn proportional to the dry

where  p g  is  the  cumulative  gas  pressure,  p w  is  the  water  vapor

ature. From Eqs. (42) and (43) , the general form of the oxygen-
transport resistance can be derived as follows [224] :

measurements, except for the limiting current density ( i
is recorded during the measurements by potentiostatically decreas-
ing  the  cell  voltage  until  the  current  no  longer  rises.  The  over-
all  transport  resistance  ( R o )  can  be  broken  down  into  contribu-
tions from pressure-dependent constituents ( i.e. , molecular gas dif-
fusion)  and  pressure-independent  constituents  ( i.e. ,  the  Knudsen
diffusion or diffusion through the water/ionomer layers), as follows
[223] :
R o = R PD + R PI

(45)

PI )  stand  for  the  resistances  of  pressure-
where  ( R
dependent constituents and pressure-independent constituents, re-
spectively.  This  classification  is  based  on  the  size  of  the  pores,
through which different diffusion-controlling mechanisms become
dominant. For instance, through relatively large pores, the molec-
ular gas diffusion is more dominant, whereas through the small
ones, the Knudsen diffusion is the effective mechanism. The third
contributing mechanism represents the diffusion through the lay-
ers of liquid water and/or electrolyte, whose diffusion coefficient
can be determined by relating the oxygen concentration within the
water/ionomer layers with the equilibrium concentration value of
the adjacent gas. However, the third mechanism only becomes ef-
fective with the presence of a catalyst layer, thus it may be ne-
glected if the GDL is not catalyzed [223] . From the cathode flow
field to the electrochemical reaction region, at least two cell con-
stituents contribute to the overall oxygen-transport resistance ( R o ):

Such a contributor separation could be suspicious when consider-

oxygen concentration shows noticeable differences in two dimen-

where f is the geometry-dependent correction factor and d is the

In this section, the fundamental concepts for the limiting cur-
rent density technique are discussed. The procedures and condi-
tions adopted for the measurements may show slight differences
in different reports (see [97,224,225] , for example).

2.2.5.1.2. Ex-situ techniques for effective diffusion coefficient mea-
surement . A diffusion cell, also known as Loschmidt cell, is com-
monly  utilized  to  measure  the  effective  diffusion  coefficients
through GDLs (see [12,180,217] , for example). The measurements
via  the  Loschmidt  cell  are  hinged  on  the  closed-tube  method,
which  was  developed  by  Loschmidt  in  the  late  1800s  [226] .  As
schematically illustrated in Fig. 19 , the experimental apparatus re-
sembles a closed-tube, comprised of two chambers – one top, one
bottom  – which  can  be  separated  (position  19 (a))  or  connected
(position 19 (b)) via a sliding gate [180] . The gate is a part of the
bottom chamber, and its top surface corresponds to the center of
the diffusion cell, which is marked as the z = 0 position on the co-
ordinate system [180] . This is also the position where the specimen
is mounted between the chambers. The apparatus is equipped with
two mass flow controllers to control the gas flow rate. An oxygen
sensor with the response time of approximately 1 s and an accu-

racy of no more than 1% is also placed at z = 19 mm (marked by
the black dot) to monitor variations in oxygen concentration over
time [180] . The humidification of the supplied gases is ensured by
the  humidifiers  placed  at  each  of  the  inlet,  marked  by  the  blue
dots. Both the top and bottom chambers are equipped with hu-
midity  sensors  (marked  by  the  red  dots),  which  allow  measure-
ments at a wide range of humidification (0–90%). The experimen-
tal setup was specifically engineered so that the diffusion of gases
inside the cell occurs according to Fick’s Law for one-dimensional
diffusion [180] . The validity discussion for such an assumption has
been covered in Refs. [227,228] . The diffusion process in the cell

where D eq
i − j  denotes the equivalent binary diffusion coefficients of
the gaseous species, and z represents the spatial dimension. The
solution of Eq. (48) for the one-dimensional diffusion process gives
the following expression [229] :

where C bottom
represents the gas species’ concentration inside the

fully starting. Fitting of Eq. (49) to the data recorded for the con-
centration variation with respect to time gives the equivalent dif-
fusion coefficient ( D eq
) , which can then be used to calculate the

equivalent diffusion resistance ( R eq ) in both the specimen and the
chambers, as follows [12] :

(cid:11)

(cid:12)

R eq =

(50)

where z is the distance between the zero axis and oxygen sensor,
and A c is the cross-sectional area of the interior chamber, through
which diffusion occurs. The resistance to the diffusion of species i

in species j inside the chambers ( R

When  Eqs.  (50 )–(52)  are  combined  by  considering  the  resis-

the following expression can be obtained for the equivalent diffu-
sion resistance ( R eq ) [180] :

In summary, the experimental technique presented in this sub-
section offers the benefit of calculating the effective diffusion coef-
ficient in several simple steps. The accuracy of the measurements
through this technique is another advantage that should be men-
tioned. The standard deviation analyses conducted by Zamel et al.
[180]  showed  that  approximately  60  different  effective  diffusion
coefficients calculated for each data point present a standard devi-
ation of only about 5%, which indicates the reliability of the tech-
nique.

2.2.6. Absolute permeability

Under standard operation, a PEM fuel cell generates nine mass
units of liquid water per second for each eight mass units of oxy-
gen  being  consumed  [24] .  The  cathode  electrode  therefore  faces

oversaturated conditions. The continuous consumption of oxygen
unavoidably establishes a negative gas pressure gradient between
the two sides of the cathode electrode. Such a pressure gradient
in turn makes the dominant gas-phase transport mechanism con-
vection. However, the transport of the liquid water in counter-flow
calls for establishment of a positive pressure gradient between the
two sides of the cathode electrode. Effective water removal is pos-
sible with the prerequisite that the negative gas pressure gradient
is successfully overcome by the positive pressure gradient or the
capillary pressure. A high resistance to flow (or alternatively low
gas permeability) induces a high negative gas pressure gradient, re-
sulting in high saturation levels within the GDL – this correspond-
ingly shrinks, sometimes blocks, the pathways through which oxy-
gen is transported from the cathode channels to the three-phase
boundary. Thus, the absolute gas permeability is a critical parame-
ter that indicates the GDL’s capability of convection governed mass
transport.

The absolute permeability is an intrinsic material property, and
thus it is independent of the properties of a gas phase. The gas
permeability of the GDL is mainly governed by its structural char-
acteristics. Hence, many models developed to estimate the gas per-
meability coefficients of GDLs are based on the pore characteristics,
as summarized in Table 6 . In most of these models, the gas per-
meability coefficients have been somewhat related to the readily
determinable characteristics of porous media. Thus far, the most
widely  known  model  is  the  Kozeny–Carman  correlation,  whose
general  form  is  given  in  Eq.  (55) .  It  is  clear  that  the  Kozeny–
Carman  correlation  predicts  the  gas  permeability  coefficients  by
considering the critical structural characteristics, such as porosity,
tortuosity, and mean pore radius. However, this equation has limi-
tations, specifically for a porous medium made of randomly pack-
aged fibers, because for such a structure, the value of Kozeny con-
stant ( K c ) cannot be derived directly, as it is not only the func-
tion of porosity but also of the geometrical properties of the flow
distributors.  Thus,  the  values  assumed  for  the  Kozeny  constant
( K c ) vary approximately two orders of magnitude in different re-
ports, resulting in estimation of far different gas permeability coef-
ficients even for fairly similar materials [230] . The general form of
the Kozeny–Carman correlation ( Eq. (55) ) was afterward specified
for  the  porous  medium  composed  of  randomly  distributed  non-
overlapping fiber structures, as given in Eq. (56) . Unlike the gen-
eral form, the specified form provides the advantage of predicting
the dimensionless permeability ( k
r 2 ) of a porous medium by us-
ing the data that can be simply transformed into the Kozeny con-
stant [230] . Tomadakis and Sotirchos [184] estimated values of the
bulk diffusion tortuosity and percolation threshold for the porous
medium  composed  of  randomly  overlapping  fiber  structures  via
random-walk  simulations.  Eqs.  (57)  and  (58)  were  then  derived
by  solving  the  generalized  form  of  Archie’s  Law  for  the  readily
available  bulk  diffusion  tortuosity  and  percolation  threshold  val-
ues. These two equations represent a specific condition such that
Eq.  (57)  is  valid  for  the  porous  medium  composed  of  randomly
overlapping  fiber  structures  in  two  dimensions,  and  Eq.  (58)  for
the porous medium made of randomly overlapping fiber structures
in three dimensions. The equations are sensitive to the direction
of  flow  ( i.e. ,  in-  and  through-plane  directions)  and  the  fiber  ra-
dius. The practical viability of these models was also investigated
by validating the theoretically calculated gas permeability coeffi-
cients with the experimentally reported results [231,232] ; however,
the  experimental  data  presented  in  these  studies  were  typically
obtained from reinforced polymer composites made of continuous
fibers, whose structures are not akin to those of GDLs.

As it is seen, significant effort s have been steered towards de-
veloping a truly comprehensive mathematical model that is capa-
ble  of  estimating  the  gas  permeability  coefficients  of  GDLs  pre-
cisely.  However,  such  a  model  has  not  hitherto  been  developed,

since gas permeability is closely related to several interrelated pa-
rameters, i.e. , porosity, pore size distribution, and fiber diameter.
These parameters also represent the contributions of only the MPS
and are likely to proliferate, if the intrinsically complex structure
of the MPL is taken into consideration. Since there is a lack of reli-
able experimental data, in many modeling and simulation studies,
the gas permeability coefficients are either taken from previously
conducted numerical works or calculated via the correlations pre-
sented in Table 6 . Therefore, the gas permeability coefficients avail-
able in the open literature differ by several orders of magnitude
from one literature source to another. Table 7 summarizes the ex-
perimentally obtained gas permeability coefficients. As will be dis-
cussed in the following subsections, there have also been attempts
to experimentally determine the in- and through-plane permeabil-
ity coefficients for GDLs.

2.2.6.1. Techniques for absolute permeability measurement .  The fun-
damental concept behind the absolute permeability measurements
is to determine the pressure drop between the two edges of the
porous media. Therefore, by simply altering the relative flowing di-
rection of the working fluid, the pressure drops (and hence the ab-
solute permeability coefficients) in both the in- and through-plane
directions can be determined. The measurements can be conducted
with various working fluids, such as oxygen, nitrogen and air, ei-
ther in dry or humidified form. In general, air in humidified form

is used to mimic the conditions in actual cell operation. Since the
principle for the measurements (and also the calculations) is well-
established,  experimental  equipment  employed  for  the  measure-
ments resembles one another, but have several simple architectural
differences. In general, with the assumptions that the velocity of
the working fluid is sufficiently small and the pressure drop across
the sample is predominantly caused by viscous drag, the solution
of Darcy’s Law for a compressible fluid flowing only in one dimen-
sion can be utilized to calculate the absolute permeability coeffi-
cients of GDLs, giving the following expression [239] :

where K is the absolute permeability coefficient, μ is the viscosity

been specifically engineered to ensure the aforementioned condi-
tions assumed for the calculations.

utilize  the  pressure  difference  between  the  two  edges  of  a
porous  medium;  therefore,  their  designs  are  conceptually  simi-
lar to each other, albeit with several architectural differences (see
[174,236,243,246,247] ,  for  example).  Thus,  here,  only  the  funda-
mental  concept  is  presented  for  through-plane  gas  permeability
measurements  through  one  of  the  well-established  apparatuses,
previously used by Gostick et al. [239] . The measurements via this
apparatus, as schematically illustrated in Fig. 20 , are based on sup-
plying  the  working  fluid  from  the  inlet  of  the  cell  through  the
specimen to the outlet of the cell. The specimen used for the mea-
surements is in the shape of a disk with a diameter of 25.4 mm,
mounted between the upper and lower parts of the cell. Adequate
sealing is ensured with a gas-tight seal that can provide enough
sealing for the pressures encountered in the measurements. The
experimental  apparatus  is  equipped  with  a  differential  pressure
sensor and a digital flow meter to measure the pressure drop be-
tween  the  inlet  and  outlet  of  the  cell  and  the  flow  rate  of  the
working  fluid  passing  through  the  specimen.  The  pressure  drop
across the specimen is measured for various flow rates for better
accuracy. For each measurement data, Darcy’s Law for compress-
ible fluids flowing in one dimension ( Eq. 59 ) can be utilized to de-
termine the absolute gas permeability coefficient of the specimen
[239] .

2.2.6.1.2. In-plane measurements . The determination of the gas
permeability coefficients in the in-plane direction relies on a con-
cept similar to that for the through-plane measurements. The mea-
surements  can  be  conducted  with  very  different  types  of  fluids,
such  as  oxygen,  nitrogen,  and  air,  either  in  dry  or  humidified
forms.  For  the  in-plane  gas  permeability  measurements,  several
designs with slight architectural differences have been developed,
whose  technical  details  can  be  found  in  [83,246,248] .  Here,  the
basic  principle  for  the  in-plane  gas  permeability  measurements
will be given through the experimental setup employed by Gostick
et al. [239] , a schematic rendering of which is presented in Fig. 21
[239] .

It is seen that the experimental apparatus is designed in such
a way that the working fluid passes only through the cross-section
of the rectangular test specimen. The upper and lower cells can be
tightened by two bolts, with a rectangular specimen is mounted
between them, offering the flexibility of conducting the measure-
ments under various compression torques. The space between the
upper and lower cells can be adjusted by situating feeler gauges
with known and constant thickness between them. Each side of
the  middle  cell  is  sealed  by  clamping  on  a  face  plate.  A  gasket
made of rubber is situated between the each side of the middle

ability measurements: (a) sectioned view of the setup (showing the internal con-

cell and the face plates. The pressure difference between the cell
inlet and outlet is determined by a pressure gauge. A digital flow
meter connected to the setup is used to determine the flow rate
of the working fluid passing through the specimen. Similar to the
through-plane measurements, the measurements can be conducted
with  various  flow  rates,  to  establish  a  clear  correlation  between
the flow rates and the corresponding pressure drops. The data ob-
tained from the measurements can be used to determine the gas
permeability coefficient of the specimen in the in-plane direction
via Eq. (59) [239] .

2.2.7. Relative permeability

The transport of the liquid phase through the GDL is controlled
by  capillary  action  [249] .  This  form  of  transport  is  defined  by
Darcy’s Law, which is an empirically derived correlation for creep-
ing flow [245,250] :
u i = − k k r,i
μi
i represents the superficial velocity of phase i . For multi-
where u
phase flow (air and water flow) in a PEM fuel cell, water velocity
( u w ) can be derived by utilizing capillary pressure ( p c = p a − p w ),
which gives the following expression [245] :

The water relative permeability – the ratio of the permeability
of phase i at a certain saturation level over the absolute permeabil-
ity of the GDL with a given porosity – is a critical parameter, which
can be regarded as the macroscopic-level indicator of the mani-
festation of fluid–fluid interaction within the pores [245] . The wa-
ter relative permeability is correlated with the pressure gradient,
which is the driving force for single-phase flow through the pores
of the GDL [251] . Hence, the water relative permeability is not an
intrinsic property of the GDL but a strong function of the porous

76

media characteristics ( i.e. , microstructural characteristics) and fluid
properties ( i.e. , multiple-phase flow conditions). The water relative
permeability can show significant variations (up to several orders
of magnitude) over the scope of water saturation encountered dur-
ing cell operation [245] .

Despite its great importance, there is still a lack of information
on the measurement of the water relative permeability of GDLs.
Probably the only available experimental procedure and setup for
the water relative permeability measurements is the one proposed
by  Sole  [252] ,  which  was  later  used  by  Ramos-Alvarado  et  al.
[253]  for  the  experimental  characterization  of  the  water  relative
permeability characteristics of Toray TGP-090 carbon paper. In an-
other experimental study, conducted by Hussaini and Wang [245] ,
the  water  relative  permeabilities  as  a  function  of  water  satura-
tion were experimentally investigated in both the in- and through-
plane directions for commercial GDLs, such as TGP-H-060, TGP-H-
090, TGP-H-120, and E-TEK carbon cloth. This investigation high-
lighted the dependence of water saturation on the type of porous
medium; carbon papers were found to present similar saturation
levels in both the in- and through-plane directions, while the car-
bon cloth yielded relatively lower saturation levels in the in-plane
direction than in the through-plane direction. Additionally, relative
water permeability measurements in the through-plane direction
demonstrated large uncertainties, attributable to severe water ac-
cumulation within the end layers – this makes the relative water
permeabilities in the in-plane direction more reliable. In this study
[245] , for the in-plane relative permeability of the test-of-interest
materials, the proper correlation – the best fitting of the experi-
mental data for  the water  saturation level between 0  and 0.5 –
was reported to take the following form [245,254] :
rl = s 3
K

(62)

As expressed earlier, the water saturation (and hence the water
relative  permeability)  depends  markedly  on  the  porous  medium
specifications. For instance, hydrophobic treatment significantly af-
fects the water saturation characteristics of porous materials be-
cause  water  saturation  is  relatively  more  difficult  in  materials
treated  with  hydrophobic  agents  [254] .  Other  than  the  intrinsic
material  characteristics,  mechanical  compression  also  affects  the
saturation levels such that water can more easily saturate within
the uncompressed porous materials at a given flow, compared to
their compressed counterparts [253] . This finding is due to the fact
that a compressed porous material yields relatively less void region
(or lower porosity) and more intricate (or tortuous) water path-
ways, leading to fairly complex flow patterns. The fitted function
of the relative permeability data obtained for mechanically com-
pressed (23.8%) TGP-H-090 with a PTFE treatment of 20 wt.% gives
the following expression [253] :
rl = s 2
K

(63)

Due  to  a  lack  of  experimental  data,  the  correlations  empiri-
cally developed for porous structures have been utilized in many
modeling studies investigating liquid water transport in GDLs. One
rl = s 3 ), which is the third-
such correlation is Willie’s equation ( K
order power correlation between water saturation and water rel-
ative permeability. Although Willie’s equation was used in many
modeling  studies  [255–257] ,  it  was  later  demonstrated  to  give
“inadequate” results  for  GDLs  in  an  experimental  study  [258] .
Willie’s equation was originally derived for well-sorted hydrophilic
sands,  whose  microstructural  characteristics  are  quite  different
from  those  of  GDLs  [258] ;  and  these  microstructural  differences
seem to yield significantly different water saturation behaviors for
GDLs. Hence, this equation is not fully applicable for the PEM fuel
cell GDLs.

Relative permeability has been also predicted via numerous cor-
relations,  developed  from  models  of  flow  in  capillary  tubes  and

Mualem  (M)  ( Eq.  65 )  [261]  correlations,  both  of  which  express
relative permeability as a function of the capillarity and wetting
phase saturation, can be given as a good example as shown below:

These correlations involve terms for capillary pressure, wetting
phase saturation and flow tortuosity. Further, in both the correla-
tions, the integration is taken over the wetting phase saturation.
The integration limits are based on the information obtained from
a soil-water retention curve – that is, relative permeability is deter-
mined as a function of water retention in a soil-water system [24] .
These two equations have provided a good basis for many expres-
sions derived to assess the capillary pressure in fuel cells. The van
Genuchten (VG) ( Eq. 66 ) [262] and the Brooks–Corey (BC) ( Eq. 67 )
[263] functions are probably the most-suitable examples of these
expressions as given below:
(cid:4)

where  P c  stands  for  the  characteristic  capillary  pressure  (also
known as breakthrough pressure), n and m denote the fitting pa-
rameters, and λ corresponds to pore size distribution.

In general, the van Genuchten (VG) function ( Eq. 66 ) is used
together  with  the  Mualem  function  ( Eq.  65 ),  while  the  Brooks–
Corey (BC) function ( Eq. 67 ) is used along with the Burdine func-
tion ( Eq. 64 ) to identify the relative permeability in the form of
wetting phase saturation [24] . Thus, the relative permeability takes
the following forms [24] :

where  VGM  is  the  Genuchten–Mualem  function,  BCB  is  the
Brooks–Corey–Burdine function, and η is the length required for
the permeation of the liquid into the porous medium. Eq. (68) was
derived with the assumption that both m and η are integers and
the relation between them is m = 1 − 1/ η for 0 < m < 1, which is
required to  achieve a  closed  form  for  Eq.  (68)  [24] .  The  readers
may also refer to [262] for further information about Eqs. (68) and
(69) . As mentioned earlier, these correlations were derived to de-
termine  the  relative  permeability  of  certain  wetting  and  non-
wetting  fluids  through  porous  media,  and  hence  they  have  not
been directly used for GDLs [24] . However, the equation, known as
the power law equation, was specifically derived to determine the
relative permeability of both the wetting and non-wetting phases
through different types of GDLs, and its general expression is de-
fined as [264] :
η
K rwp = s 2

where η denotes the fitting parameter.

Relative  permeability  has  been  also  investigated  through  nu-
merical  studies  in  which  the  pore  structure  of  GDLs  has  typi-
cally been obtained through stochastic models and the transport

of the liquid water is simulated via full morphological models (see
[52,265] , for example). Additionally, relative permeability through
GDLs  has  been  also  investigated  via  fractal  models,  which  share
the similar concept with those developed for the estimation of dif-
fusion coefficients; for example, see Refs. [266–269] .

2.2.7.1. Techniques  for  relative  permeability  measurement .  Experi-
mental  determination  of  the  relative  permeabilities  for  different
phases through porous media as a function of saturation is fairly
challenging. Accordingly, the reliability of the procedures for the
relative  permeability  measurement  through  GDLs  has  not  been
proven yet. In contrast, the measurement procedures for the rel-
ative  permeabilities  for  several  phases,  i.e. ,  oil,  natural  gas,  and
water,  through  soil  are  well-established.  This  is  particularly  im-
portant because the relative permeability measurements through
soil  are  quite  critical  for  the  recovery  of  natural  resources.  The
measurements for such resources depend on either steady-flow or
unsteady-flow experiments. In the former, two phases are concur-
rently supplied to a porous core at a constant ratio. Over a suffi-
ciently long period, the core becomes saturated with each phase
until steady-state condition is achieved. Upon achieving a steady-
state, the saturation of the core is gravimetrically determined. With
the accurate knowledge of the liquid phase saturation and the flow
rates of both the liquid and gas phase, the relative permeability for
each phase can be calculated through simple correlations. Details
of these correlations can be found in [252] .

One  of  the  most  popular  techniques  that  relies  on  steady-
state flow experiments is the Penn State method, which was also
adopted for relative permeability measurements of porous GDLs by
Sole  [252] .  The  experimental  apparatus  designed  for  these  mea-
surements is schematically presented in Fig. 22 [252] . As evident
from Fig. 22 , in the apparatus, the water and gas flow rates are
controlled by a syringe and a gas flow meter, respectively. To en-
sure  homogeneous  water  introduction  to  the  pre-mixing  section
from the upstream face, a PTFE distributor is mounted on the inlet
of the pre-mixing chamber. This chamber is purposefully made of a
tightly rolled hydrophilic cloth to provide well-proportioned water
distribution throughout the gas phase and ensure that the liquid
water enters the GDL mixing section. At the exit of the pre-mixing
section, the liquid water enters a multi-layer GDL mixing section
to minimize end effects. The chamber is sealed by inserting rigid
capillary tubes through its wall to accurately measure the pressure
differential across the layers. Both the liquid and gas phase differ-
entials are assumed to be constant across the specimen. With this
assumption, the relative permeabilities of water ( K r,w ) and gas ( K r,g )

can be expressed as follows [252] :

where μ is the dynamic viscosity, K is the absolute Darcy perme-
ability, (cid:5)P is the pressure drop, t is the thickness of the specimen,
n is the sum of the GDL layers between the pressure taps, A is the
cross-sectional area through which phases flow, and   ̇ V  is the vol-
umetric flow rate. For interested readers, further discussion on the
experimental procedure and the experimental setup can be found
in Ref. [252] .

2.2.8. Surface wettability

Proportional  to  the  efforts  steered  towards  making  fuel  cells
completely viable for high-current density operation, the criticality
of the surface wettability characteristics of the GDLs has also been
progressively recognized. The optimization of the surface wettabil-
ity characteristics for a wide range of operating conditions is diffi-
cult task, but one quite critical to provide effective water manage-
ment, independent of operating conditions during cell operation. In
particular, at high-current density operation, where the production
of water becomes greater, the excess water should be effectively
removed from the electrochemically active regions to inhibit mass
transport limitation related performance losses [270] . Herein, the
hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity of the GDLs are of paramount
importance, since they directly impact the water movement and
water removal patterns – this phenomenon has been experimen-
tally and numerically demonstrated in the open literature; for ex-
ample, see Refs. [271–274] . The hydrophobic and hydrophilic char-
acteristics of a porous medium are generally represented by the
concept of a static contact angle. The static contact angle measured
from the surface of a porous medium is an indicator of its water
retaining or water expelling characteristics, and thus it is a strong
function of that medium’s surface properties, such as its surface
roughness and surface energy [275,276] . The static contact angle
can be described as the angle formed at the interfaces of solid, liq-
uid, and gas phases. As schematically presented in Fig. 23 (a), the
surfaces are classified according to their surface wettability charac-
teristics into two categories: a surface with a static contact angle
higher than 90 ° is identified as hydrophobic, while the one with
a static contact angle lower than 90 ° as hydrophilic [277,278] . In
theory, for a completely flat surface, the static contact angle is de-

phases’ intrinsic properties, as calculated below:

sin ( θs ) =

σ Rk ( cos ( θr ) − cos ( θa ) )
mg

(74)

which is a correlation derived by Furmidge [282] . Notice that in
Eq. (74) θ s is the sliding angle, θ r is the receding contact angle, θ a
is the advancing contact angle, σ is the surface tension coefficient,
R is the length scale, k is the shape constant, m is the mass of the
liquid droplet, and g is the gravitational acceleration. For interested
readers, further discussion on the sliding contact angle of materials
can be found in Refs. [275,282,283] .

The  approaches  discussed  so  far  are  only  useful  for  obtain-
ing  qualitative  information  about  the  wettability  characteristics
of  the  surfaces,  either  the  droplet  on  them  are  in  motion  (dy-
namic  wettability)  or  motionless  (static  contact  angle).  However,
fuel cell environment is rather complicated, and the specifications
of  GDLs  can  be  quite  different,  depending  on  the  compositions
of  the  materials,  either  of  which  gives  rise  to  different,  some-
times  unforeseen,  surface  characteristics.  For  example,  as  often
noted, the static contact angles of the many hydrophobic agents
to water are smaller than those obtained, when these hydrophobic
agents are deposited onto GDLs; potentially related to the newly
gained surface characteristics, such as surface roughness, since the
surfaces  with  a  roughness  about  1 μm  leads  to  relatively  higher
static contact angles, as compared with the completely smooth sur-
faces [68] . Likewise, the degree of GDL’s inherent surface rough-
ness  can  affect  the  liquid  water  removal  from  the  micro  chan-
nels grooved into the cathode flow field. For instance, in the study
conducted by Chen et al. [284] , increasing surface roughness has
been numerically demonstrated to reduce the contact line at the
solid/liquid/gas  interface  on  the  GDL  surface,  thus  giving  rise  to
relatively  higher  contact  angles.  That  is,  a  higher  degree  of  sur-
face roughness induces relatively smaller retentive forces, which in
turn increases the detaching forces on the water droplets, acceler-
ating the droplet separation and preventing substantial water cov-
erage on the surface – the characteristics expected to facilitate the
mass transport (owing to the less complex multi-phase flow) dur-
ing cell operation. Therefore, the approaches discussed in this sec-
tion have some limitations, especially in terms of providing quanti-
tative information that can be utilized for design and/or calculation
purposes [285] .

For relatively more accurate and quantitative information, the
concept of internal contact angle measurements can also be con-
sidered to be alternative technique, to gain practical insights into
the wettability characteristics of the surfaces. In its simplest form,
the internal contact angle represents the average angle over the
properties of GDLs at a small-scale [68] . The measurements for the
internal contact angle rely on recording the mass of a working fluid
injected into the porous surface as a function of time [286] . The
measurements are preferentially conducted with the working flu-
ids, whose contact angles to the material under investigation are
close to zero [68] . After conducting the experiments with a stan-
dard working fluid, the data collected can be utilized to determine
the internal contact of the porous material to water by using the
surface tension constituents of water [68,287] . The internal con-
tact angle measurements are said to be more accurate and reliable
than the previously discussed static contact angle and sliding con-
tact angle measurements, such that it is even possible to achieve
uncertainties less than 3 ° for the porous materials upon comple-
tion of five consecutive experiments [285] . However, this technique
is mentioned to be rather laborious than the previously discussed
static contact and sliding contact angle techniques [68] . The fol-
lowing subsection is devoted to providing further information on
the techniques used in the determination of the surface wettabil-
ity characteristics of GDLs.

where γ s − g is the surface energy of the solid–gas interface, γ
s − l
is the surface energy of the solid and liquid interface, and γ
l − g
is  the  surface  energy  of  the  liquid  and  gas  interface.  Here,  it  is
important to note that Eq. (73) is derived for ideally smooth sur-
faces, and thus it does not take the surface roughness into account
[279] , even though the surface roughness has a significant impact
on the static contact angle of an unsmooth surface. As clearly seen
from  Eq.  (73) ,  the  static  contact  angle  depends  only  on  the  in-
trinsic  properties  of  the  materials  that  are  in  contact  with  each
other [275] . Clearly, Young’s correlation ( Eq. (73) ) correlates the ex-
perimentally measurable θ c  and ( γ
l − g ) to non-measurable γ s − g
and γ
s − l . According to Young’s correlation, for fixed value surface
tensions, θ c is unique, which shows clear contradictions with the
observations made for many material systems. This fact becomes
more reasonable, when considering that θ c can take more than one
value and that contact line takes on a constant value for different
θ c values – this phenomenon is generally described as the “contact
angle hysteresis” [280] . As discussed in Ref. [280] , in an attempt
to take the contact angle hysteresis effect into considerations, cer-
tain  modifications  to  Young’s  correlation  have  been  proposed.  A
comprehensive review of these modifications can be found in Ref.
[281] .

The concept of the static contact angle measurements provides
a  general  understanding  about  the  investigated  surface’s  wetta-
bility characteristics under static conditions. However, considering
the  mobility  of  the  water  droplets  under  the  effect  of  capillary
pressure during cell operation, it is also quite important to deter-
mine the wettability characteristics of the surfaces when the liquid
droplets placed on them are in motion [275] . For such a specific
condition,  the  wettability  of  a  surface  is  represented  by  the  dy-
namic wettability characteristics, and the concept of sliding angle
is defined as a quantitative indicator of these characteristics [275] .
As schematically illustrated in Fig. 23 (b), the sliding angle repre-
sents the critical surface angle, at which the droplet on the sur-
face starts sliding down from the surface [275] . Building on this,
a lower sliding angle indicates the hydrophobicity level of the sur-
face – for example, a liquid droplet is more likely to slide down
from a more-hydrophobic surface at a lower sliding angle [275] .
The sliding contact angle is a strong function of the liquid and solid

2.2.8.1. Techniques for surface wettability determination
2.2.8.1.1 . Sessile  drop  technique .  Sessile  drop  technique  is  a  com-
monly used technique for measuring the static contact angles of
GDLs. The measurements in this technique basically rely on sev-
eral consecutive steps: (i) placing a droplet of the working fluid
(water is preferred for better representation of the fuel cell envi-
ronment) onto a circular-shaped specimen extracted from the test-
of-interest  porous  medium,  (ii)  fitting  a  tangent  line  to  the  in-
tersection  of  the  solid,  liquid,  and  gas  phases  (where  the  liquid
droplet touches the surface), and (iii) determining the external an-
gle [288] . The experimental setup used in the sessile drop tech-
nique is equipped with a sample holder with a controllable sur-
face inclination, a high-resolution video camera for monitoring of
the droplet, software for fitting the tangent line to the three-phase
intersection  [67] .  The  experimental  setup  is  generally  placed  on
an anti-vibrating bench to prevent any vibration dependent errors
during the measurements. For the droplet placement, a dispenser
is used to place the liquid droplets on the surface with constant
volumes [67] . Even though the volume of droplets chosen can vary
between 5 and 10 μl in different reports (see Refs. [72,288,289] ),
it should not be extremely small or large to avoid evaporation or
penetration dependent measurement errors, usually around 7–8 μl,
as suggested in Refs. [67,288,289] . In the measurements, the static
contact  angle  data  should  be  collected  straight  after  placing  the
droplet onto the surface, to prevent or minimize penetration of the
water droplet into the porous medium. Due to the convenience of
conducting the measurements, the experiments are suggested to
be carried out with different specimens, and data should be col-
lected from multiple measurement points determined on the sur-
face of each specimen. The data obtained can be presented as a
range or as an accurate value with a standard deviation [67,118] .
The accuracy of the measurements seems to demonstrate a large
variation (see Refs. [67,288,289] , for example), such that the stan-
dard deviation of the experiments can be as high as ±5 °, depend-
ing  on  the  specifications  of  the  test-of-interest  surface,  working
fluid, and experimental procedures and conditions, and sometimes,
even the hands-on skills of the experimenter.

2.2.8.1.2. Wilhelmy plate technique . Wilhelmy plate technique is
another widely used practice that can be applied either statically
or dynamically for the contact angle measurements of porous ma-
terials [122,290] . In the static version, a rectangular specimen ex-
tracted  from  the  test-of-interest  porous  medium  is  inserted  into
a  working  fluid  ( i.e. ,  a  solution  of  hexane)  at  a  constant  inser-
tion rate until a previously determined distance, and the force ap-
plied to insert the specimen is monitored concurrently [122] . The
force  required  is  then  utilized  to  calculate  the  contact  angle  of
the  specimen.  On  achievement  of  a  certain  distance,  the  move-
ment is reversed, and the specimen is moved in the opposite di-
rection at the similar rate [122] . The data obtained allow determi-
nation of the wetting characteristics of the specimen for the in-
sertion and removal stages with the information of receding and
advancing angles [68] . The obtained receding angle can be used
to understand the surface repellency of the working fluid, while
the  advancing  angle  is  a  representative  of  the  surface  attraction
for the working liquid [68,291] . The main advantage of the Wil-
helmy plate technique to its sessile drop counterpart is said to be
the accuracy of the measurements, because in the former one, the
three-phase boundary built up at the measurement point is rela-
tively larger, and thus the measurements are less likely to be af-
fected by the surface morphology [68] . However, the main draw-
back of this technique is that the measurements can only be con-
ducted for the materials with the same surface properties on both
sides; therefore, the technique is suitable only for the characteri-
zation of the single-layer GDLs without any hydrophobic agent de-
position [68] . For the other materials, an alternative solution sug-
gested is to combining two materials together so that both sides

possess the similar surface characteristics. For interested readers,
further  information  on  the Wilhelmy  technique  can  be  found  in
Refs. [68,122,291] .

2.2.8.1.3. Capillary rise technique . Capillary rise technique is an-
other commonly used practice to determine the surface energy and
wetting characteristics of GDLs. In essence, capillary rise technique
was firstly derived from the Wilhelmy plate gravimetric technique
by  Cain  et  al.  [292] ,  and  afterward  modified  by  Lim  and  Wang
[293] to be able to directly obtain the capillary meniscus height in
a more accurate manner. The measurements involve inserting the
porous specimen into a pool filled with heated water via a hor-
izontal translator and monitoring the height of the meniscus via
a microscope connected to a camera. The height of the capillary
meniscus provides information about the contact angle of the test-
of-interest material, according to the capillary law ( Eq. (75) ):

sin θ =

2 σ − (cid:5)ρg h 2
2 σ

(75)

where θ is the contact angle, σ is the liquid-gas surface tension of
the working liquid, (cid:5)ρ is the pressure difference, g is the gravi-
tational acceleration, and h is the height of the capillary meniscus.
Unlike the Wilhelmy plate method, the capillary rise technique can
be used for the materials with asymmetric surface wetting charac-
teristics – that is, it can be used in the characterization of GDLs.

2.2.9. Mechanical properties

Optimum  mechanical  properties  of  GDLs  are  prerequisite  for
manufacturing fuel cells with improved performance, stability, and
durability.  In  a  typical  PEM  fuel  cell,  the  GDLs  are  assembled
into  the  MEA,  and  the  MEA  is  then  sandwiched  between  the
channel-machined anode and cathode flow-field plates. All these
constituents are held together with an optimal mechanical com-
pression to minimize the contact resistance and prevent leaking in
the fuel cell. The mechanical compression has a substantial impact
on the effective transport properties of GDLs, the interfacial inter-
actions between the catalyst layer/GDL and GDL/flow-field plates,
and all these unavoidably affect overall performance [50] . When
a cell is assembled with a high compression force, probably the
most visible dimensional change occurs in the GDL, whose orig-
inal  thickness  can  even  be  reduced  by  half.  This  reduction  oc-
curs because the GDL is the most porous cell constituent; in some
instances,  its  porosity  can  reach  about  85%.  Thus,  many  of  the
performance-affecting characteristics, such as electrical and ther-
mal  conductivity,  as  well  as  gas  permeability  and  diffusivity  of
GDLs, depend greatly on the mechanical compression applied dur-
ing cell operation [135] . As often noted [294] , compressing a cell
with  high  compression  force  enhances  the  contact  between  the
carbon fibers of the GDL as well as between the constituents in-
side the cell. These enhanced contacts in turn improve the elec-
trical and thermal transport in the cell, leading to reduced ohmic
overpotential [295,296] . The influence of compression on the effec-
tive transport properties of GDLs has been well-documented and
deeply discussed; for example, see Refs. [233,297–302] . Fig. 24 pro-
vides a summary of these discussions. As is clear from the sum-
mary, increasing clamping force establishes a trade-off relationship
between  the  concentration  and  ohmic  overpotentials,  confirming
that there is an ideal compression force for optimum cell perfor-
mance.

Even if the cell is assembled with the optimum compression
force, because of its inherently brittle architecture, the GDL may
suffer from mechanical failure. Compression with a minor intensity
could be reversible; specifically, the GDL can immediately return to
its original thickness when the compression is released. However,
in  general,  the  deformation  caused  by  the  mechanical  pressure
applied  on  the  GDL  is  not  reversible,  as  demonstrated  in  [304] .
Beneath  the  land,  a  GDL  experiences  the  so-called  “crashing  ef-

fect”, bringing its cumulative pore volume down. This in turn pre-
vents water removal and triggers water flooding. Under the chan-
nel,  a  GDL  is  exposed  to  relatively  less  compression  force,  lead-
ing to an uninfluenced region, through which both reactants and
by-products can flow effectively [294] . However, such a mechani-
cal deformation generates a compression gradient through the land
interface. This phenomenon, known as “tenting”, occurs when the
displacement is transferred through the lateral carbon fibers from
the regions underneath the land [294] . Particularly high compres-
sion forces can cause serious damages to the GDL by shearing the
carbon fibers at the channel/land interfaces. That is, the GDL can
experience both elastic and plastic deformations depending on its
compressive, tensile, and shear limits. These limits are the strong
function  of  the  orientation  of  the  carbon  fibers  within  the  car-
bon  matrix  and  the  geometrical  characteristics  of  the  flow-field
plates. Thus, GDLs should be manufactured to align with compres-
sive, tensile, and shear limits by taking the maximum encountered
compression pressures into consideration, because when the com-
pression  forces  exceed  these  limits,  high-stress  regions  between
the intersecting carbon fibers will inevitably emerge. In such cases,
the carbon fibers underneath the land are broken and compacted,
whereas those under the flow channels intrude into the channels,
decreasing cumulative pore volume. Much discussion on all these
phenomena can be found in Ref. [294] . Large dimensional changes
upon mechanical over-compressions may also negatively affect the
wettability characteristics of GDLs, resulting from the detachment
of the hydrophobic agent from the carbon matrix. However, this
phenomenon is more pronounced when GDLs are exposed to cyclic
compression [305] .

Another critical mechanical property of the GDL is “stiffness”,
which indicates a GDL’s capability to distribute compressive pres-
sure in a well-proportioned manner throughout the ribs and miti-
gate any volumetric deformation [50] . Thus, a GDL with high stiff-
ness can homogeneously disperse the compressive pressure on the
ribs and minimize the risk of mechanical failure due to volumetric
deformations. A high stiffness is of significant importance particu-
larly for transportation applications where the cell is more likely
to be exposed to sub-freezing conditions [34,50] . For example, fuel
cells in automobiles parked for a long period in winter are likely to
face ice formation, which can occur inside the cell constituents, as
well as at the interfaces. Since water is indispensible for cell opera-
tion, when the operating temperature dips below the freezing tem-
perature of water, critical problems may arise during the start-up
and run-up stages. Further, continuous freezing and thawing due
to decreasing and increasing cell temperature amplifies many MEA
degradation mechanisms, such as the formation of cracks, the loss

of precious metal catalyst, the delamination of the catalyst layer,
and an increase in overall cell resistance due to loss of mechanical
cohesion between the cell constituents [306–308] .

Even though the GDL plays a key role by distributing compres-
sion force throughout the ribs during the freeze/thaw process, only
very limited effort s have been steered towards investigation of the
GDL degradation. The available studies, however, highlight the crit-
icality  of  higher  GDL  stiffness  for  uniform  compressive  pressure
distribution  over  the  catalyst  layer  (see  [309,310] ,  for  example).
This is because the uniformity of the compressive pressure on the
catalyst layer can prevent potential interfacial delamination at the
GDL/catalyst layer interface [310] . The location of the GDL relative
to the flow channels can affect its overall stiffness, and hence the
uniformity of the compressive pressure on the catalyst layer. It has
been demonstrated that the bending stiffness presents a significant
anisotropy such that it has been found to be higher in the machine
direction than the transverse direction [310] . Thus, the machine di-
rection arrangement yields relatively less risk of catalyst layer de-
tachment, compared to its transverse direction counterpart.

2.2.9.1. Techniques for mechanical property determination
2.2.9.1.1 . Tensile  strength .  In  order  to  function  properly  as  a  me-
chanical damper between the membrane and the flow-field plate,
a GDL must have sufficient mechanical strength. As discussed ear-
lier, when the cell is assembled with high compression pressures,
the GDL intrudes into the flow channels, bringing about a signif-
icant drop in cell performance. To tolerate the compression pres-
sure during cell operation, there should be a good balance between
the softness and hardness of the GDL. On the other hand, if the cell
is assembled with high compression pressures and operated over a
long period, it is likely that the GDL will soften as a result of car-
bon corrosion, since the fuel cell environment is highly oxidative
and also reductive depending on which side of the fuel cell. Thus,
determining the tensile properties, such as yield strength, tensile
strength at break and elongation, for pristine and/or post-mortem
GDLs, provides insights into their mechanical properties before and
after  performance  analyses.  With  accurate  knowledge  of  tensile
properties prior to and following performance tests, GDLs can be
better assessed in terms of mechanical characteristics; or alterna-
tively, the changes in the mechanical properties of GDLs over con-
tinuous cell operation can be better detected. Even though the GDL
is not intensively exposed to tensile stress during cell operation, it
could be an important parameter to determine, particularly when
considering the applicability of further treatments, such as consec-
utive coating or lamination processes [311] .

There are several standardized methods proposed for the deter-
mination of tensile properties. Among them, one of the most popu-
lar is probably the ASTM standard D828-97: “Standard Test Method
for  Tensile  Properties  of  Paper  and  Paperboard  Using  Constant
Rate-of-Elongation Apparatus” [312,313] . However, this method, al-
beit widely utilized by GDL manufacturers, was withdrawn without
any modification or replacement [68] . Additionally, DIN EN 29073-
3: “Test Methods for non-wovens” and “Determination of tensile
strength and elongation” have been used by QuinTech [314] and
Freudenberg  [315] ,  respectively.  Similar  methods  have  also  been
used  in  laboratory-scale  investigations.  For  instance,  ASTM  stan-
dard  D638-10:  “Standard  Test  Method  for  Tensile  strength  and
elongation” and ASTM standard D3039/d3039M-08: “Standard test
method  for  tensile  properties  of  polymer  matrix  composite  ma-
terials” have  been  used  to  determine  the  tensile  properties  of
GDLs [286,316] . Although all these methods have slight differences,
all  rely  on  obtaining  the  stress-strain  curve  by  using  machines
equipped with strain extensometers. The dimension and shape of
test specimens extracted from the GDL bench can demonstrate dif-
ferences depending on the specifications of the method adopted.
Test specimens are typically fixed at their two edges to the testing
machine, and the tensile test is carried out with a constant head
speed. The head speed can also show differences depending on the
specifications of the method adopted. The test is typically contin-
ued until the test specimen is broken up, through which the strain
data at the corresponding stress values are obtained.

2.2.9.1.2.  Compressibility .  Compressibility  is  a  critical  mechani-
cal property, since GDLs are directly exposed to compressive forces
during cell operation. Considering the critical effects observed with
increasing mechanical compression ( Fig. 24 ), an ideal GDL is ex-
pected  to  conserve  its  original  dimensional  and  microstructural
characteristics under compressive forces. Compressibility of a GDL
can be regarded as the change in its thickness as it is exposed to
a compression force. If the change in the GDL thickness is more
than 20 μm (or 10% of its original thickness), then the cell might
not be sealed adequately, causing severe leaks and reducing cell
performance.  An  ideal  GDL  should  in  principle  be  compressible
enough to allow thickness to be easily adjusted during MEA manu-
facturing, by controlling the compressive load. In general, an overly
compressible GDL tends to intrude into flow channels under com-
pression, preventing reactant flow and causing significant pressure
drops.  The  compressibility  of  a  GDL  is  determined  by  mounting
the  test  specimen  between  a  base  plate  and  a  steel  rod  and  by
measuring the deflection upon mechanical compression. The test-
ing equipment employed for tensile tests are generally used for the
compressibility measurements as well.  The experiments are typ-
ically  conducted  by  following  standard  measurement  procedures
with several different test specimens extracted from different re-
gions of the GDL bench. The reduction in the GDL’s initial thickness
– also called residual strain – is determined when the compressive
load is released [317] .

The stress-strain behavior of SGL Sigracet 10BA has been inves-
tigated by Nitte [317] via an experimental apparatus, as schemat-
ically presented in Fig. 25 . The experimental setup allows adjust-
ment of the compression pressure on test specimens by varying
the loading weight. The measurements are conducted either with
single or multiple GDLs. The compression force exerted onto the
GDL is gradually increased to vary the compression pressure from
0.10  to  5.50 MPa.  The  most  significant  changes  in  the  strain  are
detected when the compression pressure is around 0.20 MPa, and
are  attributed  to  the  smoothing  of  the  initially  rough  surface  of
the test specimens. When the compression pressure is further in-
creased, two different linear regions are identified: the first occurs
in the pressure range of 1.00 and 3.50 MPa, while the second is
observed between 3.50 and 5.50 MPa. This trend is explained by
the inherent pore characteristics of the carbon paper. The first lin-

ments of GDLs, adapted from [317] .

ear region is ascribed to the crushing of hydrophobic pores, while
the second is explained by the crushing of hydrophilic pores [317] .
In  another  study,  conducted  by  Han  et  al.  [318]  in  an  attempt
to provide insights into alignment effects, variations in the thick-
ness of GDLs were determined as a function of compression pres-
sure by adopting a procedure described in [310] . Results indicate
that the GDL yields more resistance to mechanical compression in
the cross-machine direction than in the machine direction. That is,
the GDL is less prone to intrude into flow channels in the cross-
machine  direction  at  a  given  compression  pressure.  This  finding
suggests that, for a cross-machine GDL cell, the water accumulated
in the cell operation will preferentially flow out to the flow chan-
nels through the machine direction of the GDL (perpendicular to
the flow channels), likely forming more water pathways within the
GDL and thus facilitating gas-phase transport [319] . The compress-
ibility of GDLs has also been investigated from different aspects;
for example, in several studies, the focus has been on investigating
the effects of local and cyclic loading and hysteresis behavior on
GDL characteristics [304,320,321] .

2.2.10. Summary

As  a  critical  constituent  of  a  PEM  fuel  cell,  the  gas  diffusion
layer (GDL) plays key roles in mass, heat (energy), electron, and
species transport. The GDL is typically comprised of two distinct
layers: macroporous substrate (MPS) and microporous layer (MPL).
The MPS comprises of horizontally and anisotropically stacked brit-
tle carbon fibers with the diameters of 7–9 μm, and these carbon
fibers are bound into a web-like matrix by a polymeric binder. The
MPS’s  highly  porous  microstructure  provides  pathways  for  mass
and a lesser degree of heat transport, while its solid region pro-
vides effective pathways for electron and heat transport. The MPL,
however, may be best described as the simple composite of a car-
bon or graphite powder and a polymeric binder. In the MPL, the
nano-scale carbon or graphite particles provide effective pathways
for  electron  and  heat  transport,  while  the  void  regions  formed
at the carbon particle/polymeric binder interfaces provide narrow
pathways for reactant and by-product transport. The GDL’s capa-
bility in dealing with mass, heat, and electricity transport is rep-
resented  by  its  effective  transport  properties:  an  effective  diffu-
sion coefficient for the mass transport, effective thermal conduc-
tivity for the heat transport, and effective electron conductivity for
electricity  transport.  For  multiple-phase  flow,  absolute  and  rela-

tive permeabilities are the considerations for effective fluid trans-
port. These transport properties can be maintained, if the porous
components are manufactured with desirable mechanical proper-
ties. The GDL’s transport properties are closely related to its mor-
phological, microstructural, and physical characteristics, which are
in turn largely controlled by its materials and design parameters.
Through  improved  understanding,  precise  estimation,  and  hence
optimization  of  these  characteristics,  fuel  cells  can  be  optimized
for a particular application. Thus, in this section, we provide sci-
entific and practical insights and a comprehensive understanding
about two critical issues: (i) morphological, microstructural, physi-
cal, and mechanical characteristics of GDLs and (ii) ex- and in-situ
characterization techniques for precise determination of effective
transport properties.

3. The macroporous substrate (MPS)

The transport properties of the MPS depend to a large extent
on its engineering parameters, such as specifications of materials
and  designs.  Hence,  development  of  MPSs  with  optimum  trans-
port properties has been the focus of many investigations for at
least  two  decades.  As  the  research  and  development  advanced,
many promising performance enhancements, through either sim-
ple or radical modifications to the existing designs and materials
of MPSs, have been achieved. However, there is still a lack of in-
depth  understanding  about  which  characteristic  of  the  MPS  has
been the target of these modifications or which MPS characteris-
tic has the dominant impact on cell performance. In recent years,
remarkable effort s have brought several potential answers to these
open questions. In particular, there has been tremendous interest
in  optimization  of  the  MPS  characteristics  for  specific  operating
conditions or understanding of how the demand on the MPS al-
ters with changing operating conditions. The following subsections
are therefore devoted to discussing the milestones in these issues.

3.1. Material and design

Optimization of MPSs begins with the development of suitable
materials  for  simultaneous  mass,  heat,  and  electricity  transport.
Apart from these primary functions, an ideal MPS material should
fulfill certain other requirements, which can include but are not
limited  to  high  mechanical  strength,  high  thermal  and  chemical
resistance, and high stability and durability. At least two decades
of intense research and development have confirmed the require-
ments for MPS materials for fuel cell applications. As will be elab-
orated on in the following subsections, a wide spectrum of porous
materials has been investigated as potential MPSs. However, for the
sake of brevity, these materials are generally categorized into two
groups: carbon-based MPSs and metal-based MPSs. Carbon paper,
carbon cloth, carbon foam, and carbon felt are in the former group,
while metal mesh, metal foam, and micro-fabricated metals are in
the latter.

As  the  name  implies,  carbon-based  MPSs  are  wet-proofed
porous materials, typically made of carbon, sandwiched between
the  catalyst  layer  and  flow-field  plate,  and  thus  mainly  respon-
sible  for  mass,  heat,  and  electron  transport.  The  MPS’s  void  re-
gion controls mass and, to a lesser extent, heat transport, while
the remaining solid structure is responsible for electricity and heat
transport. Carbon-based MPSs have been the materials most fre-
quently employed for PEM fuel cell applications, due to their suit-
able characteristics, such as high gas permeability, high chemical
stability, high electron conductivity, high elasticity, and controllable
pore structure. Several types of carbon-based MPSs exist, with dis-
tinct architectures; and their transport properties depend mainly
on microstructural characteristics. For instance, carbon cloth is typ-
ically made of a woven carbon cloth; consequently, it has a more-

uniform microstructure, while carbon felts possess a microstruc-
ture composed of randomly curved carbon fibers. Because carbon
cloth is subjected to heat treatment at relatively low temperatures,
it shows relatively less resistance to corrosion [60] . Alternatively,
carbon  paper,  one  of  the  most  common  types  of  carbon-based
MPS,  is  comprised  of  arbitrarily  stacked  superfine  carbon  fibers
and generally undergoes a hydrophobic treatment via hydropho-
bic agents. Upon this hydrophobic treatment, carbon paper is said
to achieve the desirable microstructure for effective mass transport
functions [322] . The main focus in the fuel cell community is cur-
rently  on  carbon  paper,  with  a  few  exceptions,  since  the  woven
carbon contains high amounts of precious carbon fiber, and hence
is far too expensive than its paper counterpart [11] . Also, in gen-
eral, carbon papers possess a relatively more tortuous microstruc-
ture, and thus they are more suitable for partially humidified cell
operation at intermediate current densities [323] .

Metal-based  materials,  e.g. ,  sintered  stainless  steel  fiber  felts,
metal foams, and micromachined metal substrates, have also been
investigated as potential substrates – motivated not only by their
alluring intrinsic characteristics, such as high electrical and thermal
conductivities, mechanical strength, weldability and plasticity, but
also the properties achieved upon their employment – for exam-
ple, a high specific surface area and controllable pore, permeability,
and wettability characteristics [324] . Even though these materials
offer many obvious benefits as highlighted above, they are still at
an early-stage of development, and thus further efforts are needed
to prove their practical viability.

As  will  be  reviewed  in  the  next  two  subsections,  a  number
of experimental and numerical studies focusing on MPSs have re-
ported  the  substantial  influences  of  engineering  parameters,  i.e. ,
MPS materials, modifications to the architectures of MPSs and hy-
drophobic treatments, on PEM fuel performance.

3.1.1. Macroporous substrates (MPSs)

This subsection discusses various types of carbon- and metal-
based MPSs, with a specific focus on their characteristics and im-
pacts on cell performance. As mentioned, the microstructural and
morphological characteristics of the employed MPSs greatly influ-
ence  cell  performance.  For  example,  Kimball  et  al.  [325]  deter-
mined pore characteristics ( i.e. , pore size distribution) to be dom-
inant factor affecting cell performance through comparison stud-
ies between carbon cloth and carbon paper. The adhesive energy
between  the  water  inside  the  pores  and  water  droplets  on  the
MPS surface is proportional to the pore cross-sectional area; thus,
the force required to detach water droplets from the MPS surface
is distinctively high for carbon cloth, whose largest pores are al-
most  7  times  larger  than  those  of  carbon  paper.  In  theory,  the
smaller water droplets emerging from the carbon paper are less
likely to span the flow channel by detaching into individual wa-
ter droplets, whereas the bigger droplets are more prone to form a
slug within the flow channel prior to detachment [325] . However,
the differences in the water formation profiles and hence in cell
performances  are  case  dependent,  such  that  no  location  depen-
dent current variation is detected when the stoichiometries of gas
streams are high, whereas noticeable location-dependent current
fluctuations  are  noted  under  low  stoichiometries,  resulting  from
the  potential  starvation  at  regions  near  the  cell  outlet.  Using  a
network model, Nam and Kaviany [326] also investigated the ef-
fects of MPSs’ structural characteristics, i.e. , carbon fiber diameter,
porosity, and capillary pressure, on cell performance through in-
tense investigations of the dynamic behavior of the condensed wa-
ter within a porous medium. It was experimentally demonstrated
that a larger porosity results in a noticeable increase in the limit-
ing current density by mitigating water saturation. Similarly, Frey
and Linardi [327] compared carbon paper and carbon cloth in the
scope of MEA optimization studies. It was claimed that the influ-

ence of microstructural characteristics of the MPSs on cell perfor-
mance is significant, even larger than that of many other MEA fab-
rication parameters such as hot press and spraying conditions. In
another study [328] , effort s have been directed to the microstruc-
ture through three dimensional (3D) simulations to understand the
fundamentals behind the experimentally proven performance dif-
ferences between carbon paper and carbon cloth. In parallel with
the  results  of  the  study  conducted  by  Kimball  et  al.  [325] ,  this
study confirms the case-dependent behavior of the MPS substrates,
as such carbon paper yields better cell performance, notably un-
der  low-humidities,  because  it  has  a  more  tortuous  (more  com-
plex) structure, facilitating water retention and minimizing ohmic
resistance.  However,  carbon  cloth  is  reported  as  a  better  choice,
specifically for high-humidity operation, since it has a less tortuous
structure that provides more direct pathways for water removal –
a characteristic particularly beneficial for preventing water flooding
under  high  humidities.  Carbon  cloth’s  intrinsically  rough  surface
is  also  found  to  facilitate  the  detachment  of  water  droplets  and
hence water removal, improving cell performance at high humidi-
ties. There have also been attempts to control the water movement
in cells through simple modifications to the existing microstruc-
tures of carbon cloth and carbon paper. For instance, Kimball et al.
[325] modified two types of carbon cloth by opening up a single
large pore (around 400 μm in diameter) in different relative loca-
tions to the cathode flow channel and conducted performance tests
in  a  model  cell  for  “cathode  up” and  “cathode  down” positions
to correlate the current distribution profile with the liquid water
movement. They found that the water movement in the cathode
flow  channel  is  mainly  governed  by  gravity,  shearing  force  and
surface tension, and that water droplets can be forced to emerge
from the carbon cloth from a specific location by creating a single
large pore. The control of water formation profile and water move-
ment was utilized in their study to minimize current fluctuations.
In similar studies [329,330] , a perforation technique has been used
to  tailor  a  commercial  carbon  paper  to  improve  mass  transport
characteristics under two-phase flow conditions. This approach re-
lies on drilling holes ( i.e. , 80 μm in diameter) on the carbon pa-
per in consecutive under channel locations along the cathode flow
channel to provide effective water removal without the need for
a large pressure gradient [329] . Up to now, there exists very lim-
ited information on explicit determination of the perforated MPSs’
effective transport properties, such as absolute and relative perme-
ability, diffusivity, and thermal conductivity, as well as these prop-
erties’ relationship with the perforation diameter. Potentially, very
first attempt towards understanding the correlation between the
perforation diameter and mass transport properties has been made
by Haußmann et al. [331] . In their study, synchrotron radiography
and tomography have been utilized to examine the water trans-
port in GDLs, and the mass-transport enhancing roles of the perfo-
rations applied through the whole GDL (MPS + MPL) have been re-
vealed. Further, the perforation diameter has been correlated with
the power density obtained from the fuel cell. The optimum perfo-
ration diameter for the particular GDL investigated has been found
to be 60 μm. More recently, in the numerical study, performed by
Fang et al. [332] , the critical transport properties, including perme-
ability,  diffusivity,  and  thermal  conductivity,  have  been  precisely
predicted  in  the  in-  and  through-plane  directions  via  multiple-
relaxation-time Lattice Boltzmann technique relying on stochastic
reconstructed microstructures, and the correlation between the ef-
fective transport properties and the perforation diameter has been
predicted.

Carbon foams with different characteristics have also been con-
sidered  as  a  potential  substrate.  For  instance,  Nakagawa  et  al.
[333] investigated a highly porous solid foam made of multi-walled
carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) as an MPS. The foam was shown to
yield desirable cell performance, due to its high electron conduc-

tivity, but did not provide satisfactory microstructural characteris-
tics. In another attempt, by Du et al. [334] , a hierarchy carbon pa-
per based on uniformly growing CNTs is proposed as a remedy for
the hydrophobicity losses occurring at the sintering stage of the
MPS hydrophobic treatment process, because of the migration of
the  hydrophobic  agent  – a  frequently  encountered  phenomenon
deteriorates cell performance by increasing the mass transfer limi-
tations ( i.e. , pore blockage effect) and reducing the MPS hydropho-
bicity [335] . Consequently, the incorporation of CNTs into the MPS
structure was found to be an effective method for the mitigation of
performance losses caused by the hydrophobic agent migration. In
another study [336] , a 3.50 mm thick Reticulated Vitreous Carbon
(RVC) foam was employed as a multifunctional constituent (as a
cathode MPS and flow-field plate), due to its appealing characteris-
tics such as isotropic microstructure and high electrical conductiv-
ity and mechanical strength. Even though the use of the RVC foam
was found to be beneficial for reducing the cost, weight and com-
plexity of the cell (by eliminating the flow-field plate use), its cell
performance was a bit lower than those of its conventional coun-
terparts. However, in another experimental study [337] , the inser-
tion of carbon foam into the cathode flow channels was proved ad-
vantageous for mitigating the flow maldistribution and improving
water management.

Metal  porous  materials,  such  as  sintered  stainless  steel  fiber
felts,  titanium  and  nickel  meshes,  nickel–chromium  alloy  foams,
and copper fiber sintered felts, have also been investigated as po-
tential  materials  in  fuel  cells  for  eliminating  the  drawbacks  of
carbon-based MPSs. For instance, carbon-based MPSs are typically
composed of anisotropically oriented brittle carbon fibers, and a
high  fraction  of  their  volume  is  taken  up  by  macro-scale  pores,
making them highly susceptible to deformation upon the applica-
tion of a clamping force [338] . The large compression deformations
give rise to the formation of arbitrary pore characteristics ( i.e. , non-
controlled variations in pore characteristics) and usually a notice-
able drop in porosity, which consequently increases the capillary
pressure required to drive the water through the MPS, thus facili-
tating water flooding [339] . From a practical standpoint, the brittle
and superfine carbon fibers in the MPSs are also “questionable” in
terms of commercial applicability, in particular when the potential
vibrations and shocks in cell operation are considered [316] . Fur-
ther, conventional carbon-based MPSs typically undergo hydropho-
bic treatment via electrically non-conductive hydrophobic agents,
leading  to  a  substantial  decrease  in  their  electrical  conductivity
[132] . Thus, metal-based MPSs’ controllable architectures and de-
sirable intrinsic characteristics make them potential MPS materials
and stimulate keen research interest, specifically for their use in
direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) (see [119,340–342] , for exam-
ple).

However, only very limited attention has been paid to inves-
tigating their feasibility for PEM fuel cells. For instance, Yi et al.
[316] experimentally evaluated the applicability of sintered stain-
less  steel  fiber  felt  as  an  potential  MPS.  They  found  that  even
though the felt has morphology and microstructure similar to the
conventional carbon-based MPSs, its superior mechanical charac-
teristics  ( i.e. ,  high  tensile  and  compression  modules)  enables  it
to provide enhanced cell performance. However, this performance
enhancement  was  not  related  only  to  the  improved  mass  trans-
fer but also to the largely reduced interfacial resistance achieved
upon  amorphous  carbon  (a-C)  film  deposition.  Likewise,  Zhang
et  al.  [343]  manufactured  a  MPS  made  of  12.55 mm  thick  cop-
per foil, with enhanced electrical and thermal conductivities and
controllable pore characteristics via micro/nanotechnology to elim-
inate the ohmic resistance and mass transfer limitations encoun-
tered in PEM fuel cells. It was reported that the copper foil not
only improves water management under partially humidified con-
ditions  but  also  enhances  oxygen  transport  specifically  at  low

stoichiometries,  owing  to  its  relatively  small  thickness  and  non-
interconnected  (or  straight)  pore  structure.  More  recently,  Choi
et al. [344] manufactured an alternative titanium (Ti) foam (with
the  thickness  of  240  ± 5 μm,  having  the  dimensions  of  5 cm  ×
5 cm,  and  the  porosity  of  66%)  via  a  freeze-casting  process  as
a promising MPS with excellent ductility and fracture toughness,
along with high corrosion resistance for its use in PEM fuel cells.
Their  results  demonstrated  that  an  MPS  made  of  Ti  foam  yields
far superior cell performance (up to 66%), compared to the con-
ventional carbon-based MPS (Toray, TGP-H-060), due to its distinc-
tive 3D structure, promoting catalytic reactions substantially. Per-
haps more significantly, the MPS made of metallic Ti foam showed
much  higher  corrosion  resistance  than  the  conventional  carbon-
based  MPS  (Toray,  TGP-H-060)  – a  characteristic  that  would  re-
duce  catalyst  losses  and  facilitate  the  manufacture  of  fuel  cells
with long-term reliability, chemical stability, and economical fea-
sibility.

In another attempt, by Tanaka et al. [345] , the critical param-
eters  that  influence  cell  performance  of  perforated  metal-sheet
MPSs  were  investigated  through  a  single-phase,  isothermal,  and
multiphysics simulation. It was found that apart from the intrin-
sic  characteristics  of  the  perforated  metal  sheet,  other  parame-
ters, such as the incorporation of an MPL and design of flow field,
have a decisive impact on the mass, electron, and heat transport
properties of MPSs. However, independent of these parameters, the
use of perforated metal sheet was found to minimize ohmic resis-
tance. Similarly, Blanco et al. [346] investigated the transport and
performance characteristics of MPSs made of stainless steel perfo-
rated sheets of various thicknesses, channel widths, and channel
depths through in-situ experiments in PEM fuel cells. In the scope
of this work, they also compared the transport properties of MPS
in  which  perforations  are  specifically  engineered  to  interconnect
through  the  in-plane  direction,  with  those  of  MPS  with  straight
(non-interconnected) perforations. Results highlighted the impor-
tance of an interconnected pore network for better mass transport
and hence enhanced cell performance. They also found that these
specifically engineered MPSs have a potential to be used in par-
ticular applications and operating conditions ( i.e. , at low current
densities), specifically when their alluring mechanical characteris-
tics are considered. In another study, conducted by Huo et al. [347] ,
nickel metal foam has been employed as the cathode flow distrib-
utor, and its performance has been experimentally investigated. In
terms of cold-start performance, the cell with the nickel foam has
been demonstrated to not only yield relatively higher maximum
net  power  density  than  the  one  with  the  conventional  parallel
flow distributor but also provide superiority over its conventional
counterpart under galvanostatic control, owing to its highly porous
microstructure and uniform mass and energy (heat) transport ca-
pability. As is clear from these studies, metallic porous materials
present a good potential for the manufacture of MPSs with control-
lable microstructural, physical and electrochemical characteristics,
if further advancements are made towards fabrication techniques
and technologies, as well as modeling and optimization studies.

3.1.2. Hydrophobic treatment

An  MPS  is  primarily  responsible  for  mass,  heat,  and  species
transport in cell operation. However, in essence, development of
a single material capable of handling all these functions concur-
rently is quite challenging. Even though carbon-based porous ma-
terials are the most suitable candidate by definition, they must still
undergo a microstructure-adjustment process prior to being em-
ployed in fuel cells [348] . This microstructure process, in its sim-
plest form, involves hydrophobic treatment via hydrophobic agents,
such as perfluoroalkoxy (PFA) [349] , perfluoropolyether (PFPE) per-
oxide  [350] ,  fluorinated  ethylene  propylene  (FEP)  [351,352] ,  CF
4
plasma  [353] ,  hexamethyldisiloxane  (HMDSO)  [354] ,  polyvinyli-

dene fluoride (PVDF) [355,356] , and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)
[321,357] . The main motivation for the hydrophobic treatment on
MPSs is to improve their hydrophobic (water expelling) character-
istics.

As mentioned earlier, establishing a delicate balance between
water generation and water removal is a key challenge that must
be overcome, especially for high-current density operation targets.
The  proton  transport  through  the  electrolyte  membrane  as  well
as the ionomer depends to a large extent on the humidification
level,  because  the  proton  transport  governing  mechanisms  func-
tion adequately in the presence of sufficient water. However, excess
water  should  also  be  effectively  removed  from  the  cell  to  make
the pathways available for gas-phase reactant transport. If an ef-
fective balance between water generation and water discharge is
established,  then  both  the  ohmic  losses  and  the  mass  transport
limitations are minimized; consequently, cell performance can be
boosted  substantially.  Hence,  the  MPS  is  generally  treated  with
hydrophobic agents. The morphological and microstructural char-
acteristics  achieved  upon  hydrophobic  treatment  have  been  dis-
cussed in Section 2.1.1 .

A  hydrophobic  agent  can  be  applied  as  an  aqueous  solution
in various ways, namely: spraying, brushing, and dipping/floating
[235] . The hydrophobic agent content is controlled by either the
dipping time or concentration of the deposited suspension. The hy-
drophobic agent deposition is usually followed by drying and sin-
tering processes to achieve a homogeneous distribution throughout
the surface, which is fairly critical for uniform surface hydropho-
bicity. The engineering parameters of the hydrophobic treatment
process, i.e. , hydrophobic agent properties, deposition techniques,
hydrophobic  agent  loading,  and  drying  and  sintering  conditions,
directly  or  indirectly  influence  the  resulting  morphological,  mi-
crostructural,  and  physical  characteristics,  and  hence  overall  cell
performance, durability, and stability.

Optimizing all these parameters for a specific fuel cell is rather
difficult, because many MPS characteristics have a trade-off rela-
tionship with each other, such that an engineering parameter op-
timized for a certain characteristic may lead to serious deteriora-
tions in others. The hydrophobic agent content can be considered
as a good example of such an antagonistic relationship. An increase
in the content of the electron insulating hydrophobic agent within
the MPS can improve its hydrophobicity but may also deteriorate
its electrical and thermal conductivity to some extent. Such a trend
has been experimentally confirmed by Velayutham et al. [358] . Al-
ternatively, excessive increases in hydrophobicity may induce un-
desirable side effects. For example, Park et al. [359] reported that
higher hydrophobic agent loadings facilitate deactivation based on
water flooding, which is attributed to the capillary condensation
phenomenon. Specifically, as the content of the hydrophobic agent
inside the MPS increases, the average pore size of the layer de-
creases, and water can more easily condense within the smaller
pores  than  in  the  bigger  ones.  The  second  challenge  is  that  the
expectations  from  the  MPS  in  terms  of  characteristics  can  vary
somewhat  depending  on  the  operating  conditions.  For  instance,
under dry conditions, the MPS is expected to retain as much water
as possible for the membrane humidification, whereas under wet
conditions, the water is expected to be removed as fast as possible
to avoid mass transfer limitations. Thus, unfortunately, most of the
designs proposed to date have satisfied performance expectations
under only a very limited range of operating conditions; for exam-
ple, see Refs. [360–362] . This fact identifies a pressing need in the
fuel cell community for MPSs that can function adequately under
a full range of operating conditions. Despite this pressing need, no
significant advancement has been made in recent years, because
only very limited effort s have been devoted to clarifying how the
expectations for MPS vary with application, or alternatively how
those expectations can be met by tailoring the MPS microstructure.

ing of MPL powder, type and loading of hydrophobic agent, mi-
crostructure modification, and architectural properties. In addition,
the MPL deposition methods as well as the conditions of MPL de-
position, drying, and sintering have been demonstrated to affect
cell performance; for example as reported in Refs. [367,368] . Nev-
ertheless,  these  effects  have  been  neither  well-documented  nor
sufficiently debated in the open literature.

4.1. Carbon materials

An optimal MPL powder should have high electrical and ther-
mal conductivity, well-proportioned pore characteristics, high in-
ertness under severe chemical and electrochemical conditions, low
cost, and high compatibility with currently employed MPS materi-
als [369] . Most of the MPL designs investigated to date have been
made of carbon or carbon-like materials, such as Vulcan [370,371] ,
Ketjenblack  [372] ,  Black  Pearls  [373] ,  and  Acetylene  Black  [84] ,
since these materials fulfill a large portion of the required char-
acteristics.  For  example,  they  are  electrically  and  thermally  con-
ductive and commercially available from more than one supplier
at reasonable cost. Other materials, e.g. , pelletized carbon blacks
[374] , carbon nanotubes (CNTs) [375] , coke derivatives [11] , com-
mercial  [67]  or  synthesized  graphene  [376] ,  amorphous  graphite
or flake graphite [323] , have also been studied as alternatives to
conventional MPL materials. However, most of them are suscep-
tible  to  oxidative  corrosion,  which  was  the  motivation  of  a  few
attempts  that  aimed  at  replacing  some  of  these  materials  with
graphitized particles that have stronger oxidative resistivities [377] .
The use of CNTs as an MPL material can be given as a good ex-
ample of these effort s. Within the scope of the EU-funded Impala
project [323] , CNTs have been shown to be highly promising by
the virtue of their high durability through reduced oxidative cor-
rosion, albeit with widely recognized cost limitations. Aside from
carbon  or  carbon-like  materials,  metallic  particles,  e.g. ,  titanium
(Ti)  [378] ,  iridium  oxide  (IrO
2 )  deposited  Ti  particles  [379] ,  and
iridium-titanium  nitride  (Ir-TiN)  [76] ,  have  also  been  considered,
due to their high corrosion resistance and high electron conductiv-
ity.

When selecting an MPL material, the specifications of the tar-
geted  fuel  cell  application  are  fairly  important.  For  example,  for
cells operating under dry conditions, materials with medium par-
ticle sizes (5–20 μm) are known to show better performance than
materials with small pore sizes ( < 5 μm) [11] . This generalization, of
course, is made by considering that the materials being compared
have identical properties, except for particle size. Such a trend oc-
curs because materials with medium particle sizes help in retain-
ing water at the three-phase boundary under dry conditions, and
hence the membrane is kept well-hydrated even under dry condi-
tions. Further increase in the particle size may lead to performance
decay because of the increased mass transport limitations. For wet
conditions, however, materials with small particle sizes yield bet-
ter cell performance, due to their capability of fast water removal.
However, any interference about particle size should be made with
particular consideration, because surface and cross-sectional mor-
phology achieved upon MPL deposition is also quite important and
may completely change the overall mass transport characteristics.
For  instance,  the  MPLs  based  on  materials  with  a  small  particle
size are more prone to have cracks in the through-plane direction,
akin to desiccation cracks in soil, and these cracks sometimes are
deep enough to form direct pathways between the GDL and the
three-phase  boundary;  such  pathways  can  unpredictably  change
the overall mass transport capabilities. This phenomenon has been
previously observed and discussed well in Ref. [67] .

[360] .

Rather, most recent effort s, as discussed later, have been directed
to the MPLs, and the criticality of the MPS designs for fuel cells
has been somewhat overlooked.

4. The microporous layer

For PEM fuel cells, water management is one of the two prob-
lematic issues and hence has a direct impact on the ORR. Hence,
management of water has become the focus of research and devel-
opment in the fuel cell community. The presence of excess water
inside the cell is the major cause of reactant mass transport limita-
tions, in particular at the cathode electrode. During cell operation,
as noted previously, water is transported from the anode to the in-
terface of the membrane/cathode catalyst layer via electro-osmotic
drag, in addition to being produced by the ORR. Then, the water
is first absorbed into the ionomer existing in the cathode catalyst
layer and then transported through the void region of the cathode
catalyst  layer,  where they  are  desorbed  either  into  liquid  or  gas
phase. The water in either liquid or gas phase is then transported
through  the  pores of  the  MPS  and  eventually  expelled  from  the
cell via the cathode flow channels [363] . Optimized cathode flow
channel  geometry  is  thus  critically  important  for  effective  water
removal [364] . On the other hand, as schematically presented in
Fig. 26 , a portion of the water existing at the membrane/cathode
catalyst layer interface can be transported to the anode through
the membrane, if a sufficiently large hydraulic pressure is built up
at the cathode catalyst layer/GDL interface. This phenomenon is of-
ten referred to as back diffusion [365] , by which an MPL placed be-
tween the catalyst layer and MPS can act as a pressure valve that
retains the water at the membrane/catalyst layer interface until a
critical breakthrough pressure is reached. The fundamental concept
behind such an arrangement is to keep the three-phase boundary
humidified during cell operation. However, the MPL may also of-
fer several co-benefits as well. These include (i) distributing oxy-
gen over the three-phase boundary homogeneously, (ii) reducing
liquid water saturation by increasing capillary pressure owing to
its highly hydrophobic surface, (iii) improving interfacial interac-
tions between the catalyst layer and the GDL (and hence decreas-
ing electrical and thermal contact resistance), (iv) enhancing me-
chanical compatibility between the catalyst layer and the GDL, and
(v)  improving  catalyst  utilization  by  preventing  migration  of  the
catalyst nanoparticles into the GDL [366] . For interested readers, a
summary of the MPL application’s co-benefits can be found in Ref.
[107] .

The design parameters of MPLs have a significant influence on
the morphological, microstructural, and physical characteristics of
the resulting GDLs. These parameters include the type and load-

As aforementioned, the specifications of an MPL material sub-
stantially impact the characteristics of the resulting GDL, which can
include but are not limited to porosity, pore size distribution, pore

shape,  connectivity,  bulk  density,  wettability,  surface  and  cross-
sectional  morphology,  surface  roughness,  compressibility,  electri-
cal and thermal conductivity, mechanical integrity, interfacial in-
teractions, and mechanical and corrosive durability. However, there
is  certainly  a  lack  of  comprehensive  analysis  in  the  open  litera-
ture about the practical viability of MPL materials. MPL materials
are generally evaluated based on only a set of morphological, mi-
crostructural, physical characterizations, and cell performance anal-
yses, and many other practical considerations are overlooked. For
example,  fuel  cells  are  rather  sensitive  to  cation  toxicity,  partic-
ularly from metallic materials, hence depending on the specifica-
tions of the materials, further analyses, i.e. , of contamination and
long-term durability, should be conducted [11] . Further, MPL ma-
terials should be commercially available from several suppliers at
reasonable costs, or alternatively should be easily accessible with-
out any geographical limitations. In consequence, a potential MPL
material should be compatible with commercially available carbon
blacks in terms of cost and accessibility, while yielding better per-
formance, stability, and durability.

4.2. Hydrophobic and hydrophilic treatment

The current state-of-the-art MPLs are made of carbon particles
surrounded by a hydrophobic agent. The presence of a hydrophobic
agent within the MPL is often considered essential, to impart ade-
quate hydrophobicity, and hence to keep the membrane hydrated
under dry conditions and offer effective water management under
wet  conditions.  The  hydrophobic  agent  inside  the  MPL  also  acts
as a binder to keep the carbon particles in mechanical integrity.
In  essence,  the  microstructural  characteristics  achieved  with  the
hydrophobic treatment affect the condensation and movement of
water within the MPL. Water condenses as the pressure of water
vapor exceeds the water saturation level. An increase in the hy-
drophobic agent content reduces the pore sizes within the MPL,
and thus water is more likely to be present in the liquid phase. The
liquid  water  is  then  transported  through  the  available  pathways
and removed from the cell through the cathode flow channels. The
liquid water transport though the pores is primarily governed by
the capillary pressure, which is defined as the difference between
the gas and liquid phase pressures. In hydrophobic pores, the pres-
sure  of  the  liquid  phase  is  higher  than  that  of  the  gas  phase;
whereas,  for  hydrophilic  pores,  the  gas  phase  pressure  is  higher
than the liquid phase pressure. As often expressed [380] , the driv-
ing force for the liquid water transport in a hydrophobic porous
medium is relatively high, compared to its hydrophilic counterpart
– this clearly indicates why MPLs contain a certain amount of hy-
drophobic agent. Much discussion on water condensation and liq-
uid water transport phenomena can be found in Ref. [380] .

The  hydrophobic  agents  incorporated  into  the  MPLs  could
be  very  different  types,  namely:  polytetrafluoroethylene  (PTFE)
[381] ,  fluorinated  ethylene  propylene  (FEP)  [351] ,  polydimethyl-
siloxane (PDMS) [382] , polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) [383] , per-
fluoroalkoxy vinyl ether (PFA) [349] , polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) [56] ,
and  perfluoropolyether  blocks  (PFPE)  [349] .  The  optimum  hy-
drophobic agent loading is a function of several parameters, such
as  operating  conditions  and  inherent  characteristics  of  the  cell
components.  For  example,  a  cell  running  under  dry  conditions
will probably need more water to be retained at the three-phase
boundary, and hence will require a more hydrophilic MPL, whereas
for a cell operating under wet conditions, the expectation from the
MPL will be otherwise. Similarly, a cell assembled with a mem-
brane, which can retain adequate water even under low humidi-
ties for effective proton transport, will probably require a less hy-
drophilic MPL. The same phenomenon is also valid for the ionomer
inside the catalyst layer, such that a more hydrophilic ionomer will
be able to retain sufficient water even under dry conditions. Thus,

any attempt to keep more water inside the cell will likely induce
excessive water accumulation, and hence performance will dete-
riorate  due  to  the  mass  transfer  limitations.  The  microstructural
characteristics of the MPS on which the MPL is deposited are also
of paramount importance. If the MPS has undergone a hydropho-
bic treatment prior to being employed as a substrate for the MPL,
then the content of the hydrophobic agent inside the MPS becomes
fairly critical – it could even be decisive in the content of the hy-
drophobic agent to be incorporated into the MPL. Due to differ-
ences in these issues, the optimum hydrophobic agent content re-
ported in the literature varies between 5 and 35 wt.%; for example,
see Refs. [384–386] .

4.3. Microporous layer thickness

MPL  thickness  is  a  parameter  critical  to  overall  cell  perfor-
mance. Every single carbon particle in the layer contributes to elec-
trical  and  thermal  conduction,  and  every  single  pore  formed  at
the interfaces of carbon/hydrophobic agglomerates impacts on the
transport of reactant gases and liquid water. In fact, the thickness
of the MPL has a substantial effect on the overall electrode resis-
tance, due to its separate impacts on electrical, thermal, and flow
resistances. The MPL thickness is typically determined by control-
ling the carbon particle loading through several subsequent coat-
ing  and  weighing  steps.  In  essence,  an  optimum  MPL  thickness
facilitates  the  flow  of  reactants,  by-products,  and  electrons.  MPL
thickness  tends  to  have  conflicting  tendencies  of  influence,  such
that enhancing one transport property may worsen another. Gener-
ally speaking, an extremely thick MPL leads to severe mass trans-
fer limitations and electronic resistance, due to lengthened path-
ways  between  the  catalyst  layer  and  flow-field  plate,  whereas  a
superfine MPL is not capable of providing effective interfacial char-
acteristics and adequately homogeneous reactant distribution; and
the joint effect of these two phenomena will be reflected as a sub-
stantial increase in the interfacial electrical and thermal resistances
and in particular in the mass transport limitations.

Specifying a general optimized thickness for MPLs is rather dif-
ficult, because they can be made of materials with different char-
acteristics; or alternatively, the conditions at which they are tested
could be quite different. Thus, the specifications of the materials
making up the MPL are rather critical. The type of carbon powder
can  be  given  as  a  good  example  to  elucidate  this  situation.  Nu-
merous types of powders have a significant potential to be used in
MPLs, and each powder has inherent particle characteristics ( i.e. ,
shape, size, and bulk density) that can cause significant differences
in morphological and microstructural characteristics upon MPL de-
position. These differences are likely to result in dissimilarities in
the physical characteristics as well. Besides this, the inherent char-
acteristics of carbon particles have a significant effect on the re-
sulting  surface  morphology;  for  instance,  a  carbon  powder  with
relatively  smaller  particle  sizes  is  more  prone  to  the  formation
of surface cracks of various widths and depths; these cracks are
wide and direct pathways that facilitate mass transport. In such a
scenario, contribution of the thickness to the overall mass trans-
port  will  likely  be  affected  (either  positively  or  negatively),  and
the thickness identified as “optimum” for such an MPL will likely
not  be  “optimum” for  a  crack-free  MPL.  The  surface  wettability
characteristics  may  also  indicate  substantial  differences,  depend-
ing  on  the  specifications  of  the  employed  carbon  powder,  being
another critical factor that could create clear differences in the op-
timized  MPL  thickness.  Such  a  trend  is  also  valid  for  hydropho-
bic agents. As discussed earlier, the specifications of a hydrophobic
agent cause substantial dissimilarities in the microstructural char-
acteristics, and hence resulting physical characteristics, such as gas
and water permeability and electrical and thermal resistances, both
in the in- and through-plane directions.

higher  capillary  pressure  (see  Table  8 ))  and  ultimately  establish
a  good  balance  between  water  removal  and  reactant  transport.
The  cell  performance  obtained  at  a  high-current  density  region
( > 700 mA  cm −2 )  was  highly  promising;  however,  there  was  no
discussion on cell performance at low- and intermediate-current
density regions. For a similar goal but from a different perspec-
tive, Chun et al. [392] designed two different MPL designs: in the
first design, the layer in contact with the catalyst layer was hy-
drophilic and the one in contact with the GDL was hydrophobic,
while in the second design, the placement of the layers was the
other way around. Results highlighted the criticality of the loca-
tion of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic layers relative to the cata-
lyst layer. When the hydrophilic MPL was in contact with the cat-
alyst layer, it served as an internal humidifier and conserved suf-
ficient water at the three-phase boundary when the cell was par-
tially humidified (50% RH). In contrast, when the cell was operated
under high-humidity conditions (100% RH), the hydrophilic layer
retained excessive amounts of water, and the cell suffered from se-
vere water flooding. For the second design, observations were the
opposite, namely; the cell performed much better at high humidi-
ties (100% RH), but experienced visible performance drops caused
by membrane dehydration under intermediate humidities ( i.e. , 50%
RH). Performance trends observed in this study for the hydrophilic
and  hydrophobic  layers  are  in  good  agreement  with  those  illus-
trated in Fig. 27 (see the red and blue lines). Similarly, Weng et al.
[393] designed a triple-layer MPL; each layer’s microstructure was
controlled  by  altering  the  hydrophobic  agent  loading  in  such  a
way that the porosity was continuously increased from the catalyst
layer/MPL interface to the MPL/GDL interface. They reported that
the hydrophobicity-gradient design enhances cell performance vir-
tually over a full range of humidification; nevertheless, the cell ex-
periences continuous voltage fluctuations under high loads at full
humidity.

In  another  study,  conducted  by  Kitahara  et  al.  [56] ,  ef-
forts  have  been  devoted  to  improve  cell  performance  under  no-
humidification  conditions  through  hydrophilic  and  hydrophobic
double-layer MPLs. The main principle of the design was to retain
as much water as possible at the three-phase boundary, because
performance losses under no-humidification conditions mainly re-
sult from membrane dehydration (as indicated in Fig. 27 ), as there
is no excessive water accumulation that would hinder the reactant
supply (oxygen in the present case). Therefore, mitigating mem-
brane  dehydration  through  adequate  water  retention  boosts  cell
performance substantially. However, the design was intentionally
optimized to enhance cell performance under no-humidification at
the cathode – a fairly specified operating condition that would be
encountered solely in the transient period of cell start-up. Thus,
a cell assembled with such an MPL might suffer from severe wa-
ter  flooding,  especially  under  high-humidity  operation.  In  an  at-
tempt to address this omission, in their next study, Kitahara et al.
[384]  directed  their  focus  to  improving  cell  performance  under
both low- and high-humidity operation, using another hydrophilic
and  hydrophobic  MPL  design.  However,  this  time,  the  material
used in the hydrophobic layer was titanium dioxide (TiO
2 ). In the
MPL design, an extremely thin hydrophilic layer (as thin as 5 μm)
2  particles  was  in  direct  contact  with  the  catalyst
containing  TiO
layer, while a relatively thick (as thick as 90 μm) hydrophobic layer
was further away from the catalyst layer. The design proposed was
reported to be effective not only at water conservation under low-
humidity operation but also at water removal when the cell was
operated at elevated humidification levels. On the basis of these
findings,  the  proposed  design  seems  to  have  a  great  promise  of
being employed in the next-generation fuel cells; nevertheless, it
is worth noting that the performance characteristics reported were
obtained from a small-scale fuel cell (with an electrode geometric
area of 4.2 cm 2 ); in such a small-scale cell, a majority of the mass

operating conditions, adapted from [108] .

Aside  from  the  materials’  inherent  characteristics,  operating
conditions  are  also  of  significant  importance.  For  example,  two
MPLs of different thicknesses may perform differently under differ-
ent humidification levels, such that a thicker one is likely to per-
form better under dry conditions by creating a larger barrier for
water removal, whereas a thinner one is likely to perform better
under  wet  conditions,  since  there  will  be  less  resistance  to  wa-
ter  removal.  This  comparison  is  made  with  the  assumption  that
both  the  MPLs  are  manufactured  from  the  same  materials  with
the  identical  compositions.  Recently,  such  a  trend  has  been  ex-
perimentally confirmed by Morgan et al. [11] . Due to the differ-
ences mentioned above, the optimized MPL thicknesses reported
in the open literature demonstrate clear differences; for example,
see Refs. [387–390] .

4.4. Innovative microporous layer designs

It has gradually become clearer that performance of a PEM fuel
cell depends to a large extent on the establishment of a delicate
balance between water removal for smooth reactant transport and
water retention for effective membrane hydration; such a balance
is largely possible with optimization of multiple-phase flow of re-
actant  and  by-product  species.  Nevertheless,  due  to  the  antago-
nistic relationship between water management and reactant trans-
port, the GDL designs proposed up to now have been optimized for
only particular applications or operating conditions, as schemati-
cally illustrated in Fig. 27 [108] . However, this is not fully satis-
factory for end-use applications. To make the fuel cells completely
viable for commercial applications, GDLs have to be developed by
concurrently  considering  any  operating  conditions  that  could  be
encountered [108] . A GDL designed in such a way is expected to
present virtually constant performance under a full range of hu-
midification at high current densities, as represented by the green
line in Fig. 27 .

Up to now, in an attempt to optimize the water management
over these specified operating conditions, very different types of
GDLs (MPSs + MPLs) have been proposed. As an example, some re-
cently introduced design concepts are shown in Table 8 . For ex-
ample, double and triple layered MPLs with various levels of hy-
drophobicity  and  porosity  have  been  designed;  however,  all  the
proposed  designs  still  have  some  certain  limitations.  Tang  et  al.
[391] developed a triple-layer MPL; each layer’s porosity was con-
trolled by a pore forming agent (NH
4 Cl), such that the diameter
of the pores was gradually reduced from the interface of the cata-
lyst layer/MPL to the GDL. The main concept behind the porosity-
gradient design was to increase the driving force applied on the
liquid  droplets  (by  tailoring  microstructural  characteristics  for  a

transport  limitations  – which  are  far  more  noticeable  in  scaled-
up fuel cells – are inherently minimized. Consequently, the perfor-
mance of the MPL design proposed should be verified for scaled-
up fuel cells as well. More recently, as summarized in Table 8 , Ki-
hatara et al. [375,394,395] have proposed several other innovative
MPL designs containing hydrophobic and hydrophilic layers. As a
matter of fact, the proposed designs have a remarkable potential
to improve the water management and reactant transport under
a wide range of humidification levels; nevertheless, the scope of
these works has been limited only to small-scale PEM fuel cells.

In  addition  to  the  MPLs  made  of  multiple  hydrophobic  and
hydrophilic  layers,  there  have  also  been  some  efforts  at  fabri-
cating  MPLs  made  of  a  single  layer  with  both  hydrophobic  and
hydrophilic  characteristics.  For  example,  Ahn  et  al.  [396]  intro-
duced a commercial copolymer containing hydrophilic functional
groups  into  the  conventional  MPL  slurry;  namely,  the  MPL  was
comprised of three materials: carbon powder, hydrophobic agent,
and  copolymer.  Interestingly,  it  was  demonstrated  that  with  an
optimum copolymer content (10 wt.%), it was possible to enhance
cell performance under a wide range of operation conditions (see
Table 8 ). The performance improvements achieved were largely at-
tributed to the presence of the hydrophilic functional groups, as
these  groups  facilitated  absorption  of  the  liquid  water  from  the
catalyst/ionomer agglomerates. The effective water removal prob-
ably  led  to  an  extension  on  the  three-phase  boundary  and  re-
duced  the  charge  transfer  resistance.  However,  all  these  obser-
vations  were  made  when  the  cell  was  operated  at  low  current
densities. As expected, at intermediate and high current densities,
the charge transfer resistance demonstrated a noticeable increase,
which  likely  resulted  from  excessive  water  accumulation  at  the
three-phase boundary. The performance analyses of the MPLs pro-
posed were obtained in a small-scale PEM fuel cell (with an elec-
trode geometric area of 5 cm 2 ); in such small-scale cells, as men-
tioned  earlier,  due  to  dimensional  advantages,  the  performance-
limiting  mass  transport  limitations  are  automatically  minimized.
Thus, the proposed MPL design should be further investigated in
large-scale PEM fuel cells to reveal its potential for practical viabil-
ity.

In another study, conducted by Chun et al. [397] , thermal ex-
pandable  graphite  was  employed  as  an  MPL  material  to  create
a porosity gradient inside the MPL. Thermal expandable graphite
particles  are  relatively  large  (with  respect  to  conventional  car-
bon particles) and show large expansion upon heat treatment, so
that when these particles are incorporated into the MPL, they are

surrounded  by  carbon  particles  and  hydrophobic  agent,  produc-
ing large agglomerates. When the MPL is subjected to heat treat-
ment,  these  agglomerates  expand  up  to  a  factor  of  two,  hence
new  pores  are  formed.  Hence  if  the  content  of  the  thermal  ex-
pandable graphite loaded onto the MPL is increased progressively
from  the  catalyst  layer/MPL  interface,  the  volume  of  the  large-
scale pores near the MPL/GDL surface will increase, generating a
porosity-gradient. Due to such favorable microstructural character-
istics, both the gas and water permeability of the MPL were visi-
bly improved; the improvements in the physical characteristics of
the MPL enabled the cell to perform better at high humidities and
high loads. Based on these findings, the proposed design is highly
promising; however, a better understanding of its potential to be
used in the next-generation of fuel cells requires further investi-
gation of its performance characteristics under low-humidity oper-
ation. Similarly, Wang et al. [72] prepared MPLs with unique mi-
crostructural  and  wettability  characteristics  by  depositing  a  thin
layer made of a silica/poly(dimethylsiloxane) composite onto the
MPSs. With the deposition of this MPL, the surface characteristics
of the MPS were greatly improved such that a static contact angle
of 162 ± 2 ° and a sliding angle of 5 ° were achieved. The silica par-
ticles inside the MPL generated more hydrophilic pores, and in this
way, the pore size distribution became much more uniform. Over-
all, the MPL yielded favorable microstructural and morphological
characteristics, which further led to better cell performance under
high-humidity operation; however, there was no consideration of
dry or partially humidified conditions.

In  recent  years,  there  has  also  been  a  shift  towards  the  use
of graphene – a monolayer of carbon atoms packaged in a two-
dimensional  matrix  – as  an  MPL  material.  This  trend  has  been
primarily  motivated  by  the  inherently  unique  characteristics  of
graphene, such as its unprecedentedly high single-particle electri-
cal  conductivity  ( ∼10 8  S/m)  and  thermal  conductivity,  alongside
desirable mechanical stiffness and elasticity [67,398,399] . Graphene
is comprised of flake-like particles, which are prone to build up a
horizontally packaged and well-connected network upon deposi-
tion onto a porous medium. Along with graphene’s unique phys-
ical characteristics, this compact and well-organized surface mor-
phology has been demonstrated to provide relatively less in- and
through-plane  electrical  resistance  and  thermal  resistance,  desir-
able  interfacial  characteristics  (a  better  mechanical  integrity  and
a  higher  degree  of  surface  contact  with  the  catalyst  layer)  and,
even more importantly, enhanced water management, regardless of
operating conditions. In addition, recently developed cost-effective

graphene production techniques have a significant potential to take
graphene a step further towards being employed as an MPL mate-
rial in the next-generation fuel cells.

Leewner  et  al.  [400]  situated  commercial  graphene  foam  be-
tween  the  catalyst  layer  and  GDL  as  a  free-standing layer  – the
mechanically integrity between the cell constituents was ensured
upon mechanical compression. Since the graphene foam was not
originally engineered as an MPL, its surface became non-uniform
upon compression. Further, the graphene foam had not undergone
any  hydrophobic  treatment;  thus  its  surface  wettability  charac-
teristics were not satisfactory as well. Nevertheless, the graphene
foam showed desirable in-plane electrical conductivity, because the
graphene flakes constructed a well-connected network in the in-
plane direction. Hence, there were more direct electron carrying
pathways within the foam. Another probable reason for such low
electrical resistance was that the foam did not contain any elec-
tron insulator hydrophobic agent. It was also observed that upon
mechanical  compression  during  cell  assembly,  the  free-standing
graphene  foam  was  firmly  adhered  to  the  catalyst  layer,  due  to
the affinity of graphene to the polymer binder embedded in the
catalyst layer. In terms of cell performance, it was seen that the
cell assembled with the graphene foam did not suffer from ohmic
overpotential too much, because the graphene foam obstructed the
water removal from the three-phase boundary and thus conserved
sufficient  water  for  membrane  humidification  under  dry  condi-
tions. The durability characteristics were also promising, such that
the graphene foam yielded excellent durability over 80 polariza-
tion cycles during 150 h of continuous operation. However, slight
voltage fluctuations were noted when the cell was operated under
high loads, likely because of water flooding.

Najafabadi  et  al.  [376]  employed  electrochemically  exfoliated
graphene as an MPL material. This was probably the first study to
investigate graphene as an MPL material, as the MPL ink was made
of graphene and a hydrophobic agent, unlike in the previous study.
In this study, it was observed that graphene showed great promise
to mitigate kinetic and ohmic losses due to the achieved interfa-
cial characteristics between the catalyst layer and MPL. However, it
was seen that electrochemically produced graphene micro sheets
in  the  MPL  constructed  a  firmly  packaged  layer  that  prevented
water removal from the three-phase boundary, and hence led to
performance  drops  under  high-humidity  operation.  As  a  remedy
for  the  water  flooding  problem,  a  composite  of  graphene  micro
sheets  was  considered  with  the  conventional  carbon  black  with
spherical particles. The performance characteristics of this compos-
ite  MPL  revealed  that  when  the  graphene  was  mixed  with  con-
ventional  carbon  black,  cell  performance  greatly  improved,  since
the presence of graphene improved the interfacial characteristics,
while that of carbon black provided more water pathways for ef-
fective  water  removal.  However,  the  performance  characteristics
reported in these two studies were obtained only in small-scale
fuel cells with electrode geometric areas of 5 cm 2 . In consequence,
even though these studies established a solid basis by providing
insights  into  graphene’s  potential  as  an  MPL  material,  there  re-
main several open questions; for example, there was clear uncer-
tainty about graphene-based MPLs’ practical viability for scaled-up
fuel cells. This uncertainty was afterward addressed in the study
conducted by Ozden et al. [67] . They conducted detailed morpho-
logical, microstructural, and physical characterizations and single
scaled-up cell performance analyses to elucidate the reasons be-
hind the previously determined performance improvements. It was
observed that, by its very nature, graphene provided almost two
times  higher  electron  transport  capability,  and  that  the  unique
morphology of the graphene-based MPL established a good balance
between  water  management  and  reactant  transport  over  a  wide
range  of  humidification  levels  (from  40%  RH  to  100%).  However,

there was no investigation into the long-term performance of the
graphene-based MPLs, and this remains open for future studies.

5. Scientific challenges and future prospects

While there have been significant advancements, technical and
scientific milestones remain ahead in PEM fuel cell technology de-
velopment. These milestones will certainly be achieved as our un-
derstanding of transport phenomena widens. Below a list of the
scientific and technical limitations is summarized as the most crit-
ical ones restricting further advancements in PEM fuel technology.

1. The greatest challenge for numerical and modeling studies is
still  the  complexity  of  transport  phenomena  inside  the  GDL.
The  dauntingly  complex  transport  mechanisms  make  it  diffi-
cult  to  understand  even  the  experimentally  observed  perfor-
mance improvements. The performance improvement obtained
with  the  deposition  of  a  microporous  layer  (MPL)  onto  the
macroporous substrate (MPS) can be considered as a good ex-
ample. Many developed models do not consider macroscopic-
level transport phenomena, because there is a lack of complete
understanding of the electrochemical dynamic process due in
part to experimental difficulties in examining the macroscopic
level water transport during cell operation. Only very recently,
a few physical models, which rely on synchrotron X-ray radio-
graphy  visualizations  or  environmental  scanning  electron  mi-
croscopy (ESEM) observations supported with water-transport
pore-network  analyses,  have  been  developed.  However,  there
is still a significant room for investigation into the transport-
enhancing roles of MPLs.

2. Thermal  analyses  of  GDLs  still  remain  highly  simplified.  The
dauntingly  complex  and  simultaneously  occurring  heat  trans-
fer mechanisms, fairly intricate and anisotropic microstructure
of  the  GDL  and  high  differences  in  thermal  conductivities  of
solid and gas phases make the determination of effective ther-
mal conductivities quite challenging. Thus, many thermal anal-
yses are still based on the simple model representations.

3. The basic diffusion phenomena in the GDL remains poorly un-
derstood; thus, many developed models/correlations so far have
estimated the diffusion coefficients by considering only a few
microstructural parameters, and the true microstructural char-
acteristics of the GDLs have not been fully represented. The lack
of a general correlation/model for explicit estimation of the ef-
fective diffusion coefficients motivated the experimental efforts,
and correspondingly there has been significant progress in both
in- and ex-situ techniques for the determination of the gas dif-
fusion coefficients of GDLs.

4. A truly comprehensive mathematical model for rigorous esti-
mation  of  the  gas  permeability  coefficients  of  GDLs  has  not
hitherto been developed, because gas permeability is the strong
function of several interrelated microstructural parameters, i.e. ,
porosity,  pore  size  distribution,  fiber  diameter,  and  orienta-
tion. Further, these parameters are prone to proliferate, if the
rather complex microstructure achieved upon MPL deposition is
considered. The current models/correlations consider only very
basic microstructural characteristics and generally neglect the
contributions  from  the  MPL.  Even  though  experimental  tech-
niques  provide  much  more  reliable  data,  there  is  currently  a
lack of experimental data, and thus in many modeling studies,
the gas permeability coefficients are either taken from previ-
ously conducted numerical works or calculated via simple cor-
relations.

5. Although water relative permeability is a representative of wa-
ter transport in the GDL, there is still a lack of clear informa-
tion on its measurement. The only experimental procedure and
apparatus for relative permeability measurement has been de-

93

veloped very recently; correspondingly, there is currently a lack
of experimental data. Thus, many empirical correlations in use
today  were  originally  developed  for  porous  materials,  whose
microstructural  characteristics  are  far  different  from  those  of
GDLs.

6. Mechanical  properties  of  GDLs  are  of  significant  importance,
particularly when considering that the GDL is the most porous
cell constituent and its thickness can reduce to half of its orig-
inal thickness during cell assembly, and this displacement sig-
nificantly changes its effective transport properties. Moreover,
a  fuel  cell  environment  is  highly  oxidative,  and  a  GDL  com-
pressed  over  a  long  period  will  likely  soften  because  of  car-
bon corrosion. Determining the mechanical properties of GDLs,
i.e. ,  yield  strength,  tensile  strength  at  break  and  elongation,
for the pristine and/or post-mortem GDLs will provide insights
into mechanical properties prior to and following performance
tests. With this information, GDLs can be optimized in terms
of mechanical properties, or the mechanical deformations over
a certain period can be better detected. Despite its great im-
portance,  there  has  been  very  limited  focus  on  the  mechan-
ical properties of GDLs. In the available studies, however, the
presence of MPLs has been generally overlooked. Furthermore,
there  is  currently  significant  room  for  experimental  and  nu-
merical works on other GDL characteristics, such as compress-
ibility  and  bending  stiffness.  In  summary,  the  criticality  of
the mechanical properties of GDLs to overall cell performance,
durability, and stability is not yet understood and sufficiently
documented.

7. For the macroporous substrates (MPSs), most of the designs de-
veloped so far have satisfied performance expectations only un-
der a very limited range of operating conditions. Hence, MPSs
that  can  perform  reasonably  over  a  wide  range  of  operating
conditions are immediately needed and critical for practical ap-
plications.  Despite  this  pressing  need,  no  significant  progress
has occurred in recent years, mainly because of insufficient ef-
forts  to  understanding  completely  how  the  demands  on  the
MPS change during cell operation, or how those demands can
be met through innovative design strategies.

8. For  the  MPLs,  progress  made  can  be  divided  into  two  cate-
gories:  in  materials  and  in  designs.  For  MPL  materials,  there
has been substantial progress in developing new, non-precious
carbon-like and metallic materials. There has been also a shift
towards  replacing  conventional  carbon-based  materials  with
graphitized or metallic particles with stronger oxidative resis-
tivities,  such  as  carbon  nanotubes  (CNTs),  titanium  (Ti),  irid-
2 )  deposited  Ti  particles,  and  iridium–titanium
ium  oxide  (IrO
nitride (Ir-TiN). The recent discovery of graphene has also in-
troduced a whole new dimension to MPL designs. These highly
thermally and electrically conductive, flake-like structures ap-
pear to improve cell performance over a wide range of oper-
ating conditions through better water management. However,
the MPLs made of graphene are currently at the initial-concept
phase and have not been investigated for their durability and
stability  characteristics  yet.  Further,  there  is  certainly  a  lack
of  understanding  of  whether  they  are  fully  viable  for  practi-
cal applications or not, since there is only one study, which re-
ports their performance characteristics for scaled-up fuel cells,
available in the open literature. In general, significant room re-
mains  for  complete  investigations  of  the  practical  applicabil-
ity of MPL materials. The investigations of MPL materials are
generally  limited  to  the  characterization  of  a  set  of  morpho-
logical, microstructural, and physical characteristics, and many
other  important  practical  considerations,  such  as  contamina-
tion  and  long-term  durability  analyses,  have  not  been  exam-
ined yet. Moreover, in many studies, the cost of the materials

under investigation has not been taken into consideration, such
that most of the proposed materials are not currently available
from  more  than  one  supplier  at  low  costs.  For  MPL  designs,
even though there has been robust investigation of the devel-
opment of alternative design strategies to improve cell perfor-
mance over a full range of operating conditions, so far, unfor-
tunately, no design has fully satisfied the performance expec-
tations for all the conditions that can be encountered in cell
operation.

6. Concluding remarks

Proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells have been receiv-
ing significant attention as an efficient energy conversion device
and  clear  power  source,  due  to  their  significant  potential  to  re-
place many conventional power sources in the next-generation au-
tomotive,  portable,  and  stationary  applications.  Current  research
effort s are thus centering largely on developing strategies to make
them completely viable for end-use applications. These efforts have
been primarily directed to sophisticated design strategies that en-
sure  effective  cell  operation  at  high  current  densities.  Achieve-
ment  of  such  a  target  would  certainly  drive  the  technology  one
big  step  further  towards  widespread  commercialization,  since  in
such a scenario fuel cells could be manufactured far smaller and
be cost effective for a given power requirement. The main tech-
nical challenge in improving the power generation in such a way
is  to  optimize  multiple-phase  flow  of  mass,  heat,  and  electric-
ity  in  the  cell  constituents,  which  will  only  be  possible  with
complete understanding, accurate determination, and hence opti-
mization of the parameters affecting these three major transport
mechanisms.

The criticality of the gas diffusion layers (GDL), as a constituent
that  plays  primary  roles  in  mass,  heat,  and  electricity  transport,
has  been  increasingly  recognized.  The  effectiveness  of  a  GDL  in
mass,  heat,  and  electricity  transport  is  typically  determined  by
its  effective  transport  properties,  namely,  the  effective  diffusion
coefficient,  absolute  and  relative  permeability  coefficients,  effec-
tive thermal conductivity, and effective electron conductivity, re-
spectively, in addition, the surface wettability conditions. An ideal
GDL should maintain these transport properties over a sufficiently
long period, which is largely dependent on its mechanical prop-
erties.  Both  the  transport  and  mechanical  properties  of  the  GDL
are closely related to its morphology, microstructure, and physical
characteristics; which are all in turn a strong function of its ma-
terial and design properties. In this article, a detailed review and
complementary discussions have been focused on the experimen-
tal,  numerical,  and  theoretical  efforts  devoted  to  (i)  understand-
ing  the  morphological,  microstructural,  and  physical  characteris-
tics, and hence the effective transport properties of GDLs, (ii) esti-
mating the effective transport properties of GDLs through ex- and
in-situ characterizations, and (iii) investigating potential materials
and design strategies for GDLs and their relevant impacts on cell
performance.

In recent years, there has been significant progress towards un-
derstanding the morphological, microstructural, and physical char-
acteristics of GDLs, in particular through newly developed ex-situ
characterization  techniques,  which  has  allowed  a  better  under-
standing  of  GDLs’  performances  over  a  wide  range  of  operating
conditions.  Despite  such  considerable  progress,  the  high  level  of
complexity of transport phenomena and technical difficulties in in-
situ  characterizations  has  been  the  biggest  obstacle  towards  ac-
curate  determination,  and  hence  optimization  of  effective  trans-
port properties of GDLs. Since there is a lack of rigorous descrip-
tion of effective transport properties under actual cell operation,
a vast majority of the numerical and models do not consider the

true  transport  phenomena,  whereupon  they  only  rely  on  simple
model representations. In addition, despite their significant impor-
tance for maintaining effective transport properties, there is still
a considerable room for experimental and numerical investigation
into  mechanical  properties  of  GDLs,  such  as  compressibility  and
bending stiffness. In particular, in numerical and modeling studies
on mechanical properties, the presence of the microporous layer
(MPL) should be taken into account for better representation of the
GDL architecture.

For the macroporous substrates (MPSs), large numbers of the
materials employed and designs proposed have satisfied the per-
formance demands under only a very narrow range of operating
conditions, mainly related to the lack of understanding pertaining
to how the expectations about MPSs change with altering operat-
ing  conditions  or  how  MPSs  can  become  less  sensitive  to  varia-
tions in operating conditions. For MPLs, despite the promising ad-
vancements in the development and implementation of new mate-
rials, most of the investigations have been limited to rather super-
ficial analyses. To better evaluate their practical applicability, the
investigations into MPLs should include variety of aspects, such as
contamination, long-term stability and scaled-up cell performance
characteristics, and cost and accessibility. Lastly, MPLs should be
designed considering all the operating conditions that could be en-
countered in cell operation, and hence they should be able to es-
tablish an effective balance between reactant transport and water
removal independent of operating conditions.
