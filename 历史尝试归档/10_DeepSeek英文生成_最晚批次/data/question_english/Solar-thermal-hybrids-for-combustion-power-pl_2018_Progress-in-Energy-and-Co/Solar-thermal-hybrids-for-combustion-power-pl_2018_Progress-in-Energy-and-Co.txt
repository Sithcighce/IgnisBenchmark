The development of technologies to hybridise concentrating solar thermal energy (CST) and combus-
tion technologies, is driven by the potential to provide both cost-effective CO2 mitigation and firm
supply. Hybridisation, which involves combining the two energy sources within a single plant, offers
these benefits over the stand-alone counterparts through the use of shared infrastructure and
increased efficiency. In the near-term, hybrids between solar and fossil fuelled systems without car-
bon capture offer potential to lower the use of fossil fuels, while in the longer term they offer poten-
tial for low-cost carbon-neutral or carbon-negative energy. The integration of CST into CO2 capture
technologies such as oxy-fuel combustion and chemical looping combustion is potentially attractive
because the same components can be used for both CO2 capture and the storage of solar energy, to
reduce total infrastructure and cost. The use of these hybrids with biomass and/or renewable fuels,
offers the additional potential for carbon-negative energy with relatively low cost. In addition to
reviewing these technologies, we propose a methodology for classifying solar-combustion hybrid
technologies and assess the progress and challenges of each. Particular attention is paid to “direct
hybrids”, which harness the two energy sources in a common solar receiver or reactor to reduce total
infrastructure and losses.

1. Introduction

PConcentrating solar thermal energy (CST) technologies make use
of the entire solar spectrum to provide a source of high-temperature
process heat in the range 500(cid:1)2000 °C, which is compatible with
temperatures generated by combustion, to produce power, fuels,
and materials [1]. CST technology is commercially available at the
lower end of this temperature range for power production, while
higher temperatures in a wide range of applications presently per-
formed by combustion have been demonstrated at lab or pilot-scale
using CST [1(cid:1)3]. Another driver for CST is its compatibility with
thermal energy storage, which is a very low-cost method of storage.
Nevertheless, its reliance on the intermittent and variable direct
solar radiation resource makes it complimentary with combustion,
which utilizes the energy-dense source of stored energy in fuels.
This, combined with the strong temperature compatibility, provides
a strong driver to integrate them to achieve one continuous process
rather than two variable ones. This combination is hereafter termed
“CST-hybrids” for brevity.

PCST-Hybrids offer both low net CO2 emissions and firm supply,
providing greater security of supply than is possible with only “dis-
patchability” . Firm supply is increasingly sought in OECD nations
because the growth in intermittent renewables is leading to the
increased curtailment of their output, while the strong growth in
total demand in non-OECD nations is providing strong incentive to
install new plants that cannot provide firm supply [4]. In addition to
the capacity to provide firm supply, CST-hybrids offer more cost
effective power generation than is possible with the equivalent
stand-alone solar thermal and combustion power plants because of
the opportunities for infrastructure sharing, increases in efficiency,
and greater capital utilisation [5,6]. For example, Spelling and Lau-
mert [7] found that hybridising the topping cycle of a Gas Turbine
Combined Cycle (GTCC) is more economic under most conditions
than “hybridising” with solar photovoltaic (PV) energy behind the
meter (to share electrical infrastructure), which results in the gas
turbine being turned down to operate at lower efficiency to accom-
modate the solar resource. However, many other possible hybrid
configurations are also possible and no systematic review is avail-
able of their relative merits. The overall aim of the present review is
to meet this need.

PGiven the wide range of technologies under development for
both concentrating solar thermal and combustion technologies in
isolation, the number of potential combinations of hybrids between
them is even greater. It includes those that harness a relatively small
fraction of solar energy into commercially available combustion
plant without carbon-capture, such as the low temperature solar
heating of the feedwater to a steam boiler [8(cid:1)12], hybrids with a gas
turbine [7], hybrids that integrate solar thermal into a CO2 capture
process [13(cid:1)17], including hybrids with chemical looping combus-
tion [18(cid:1)21]. However, the majority of hybrid technologies reported
to date have combined components developed for stand-alone CST
or combustion technologies. It is only relatively recently that fully
integrated components are also beginning to emerge that are pur-
pose-designed to harness both energy sources, such as the Hybrid
a
Solar Receiver-Combustor

[6,22,23]. Given this diversity,

Psystematic approach is needed to classify and compare them.
Another aim of the present review is to provide this classification.

PThe available reviews of hybrids-CST technologies have been lim-
ited mostly to the configuration for which a regenerative Rankine
cycle is hybridised by the addition of relatively low temperature to
the feedwater in to the boiler [24,25]. In contrast, the recent review
by Nathan et al. [3], addressed the combustion-related research chal-
lenges associated with the range of emerging hybrid technologies,
but did not review the strengths and limitations of these technolo-
gies directly. For this reason, the present review aims to meet the
need for a review of the wide range of hybrid technologies that have
been proposed previously, and also to propose an overarching
framework with consistent definitions against which to evaluate
their relative merits.

PIn light of drivers described above, the aims of the present review

are as follows:

P1. To identify the potential benefits of hybridising CST and com-

bustion technologies;

P2. To identify and classify the range of approaches with which CST

and combustion can be combined into a hybrid system;

P3. To identify the CST-hybrid technologies with greatest potential
to meet the need for carbon-neutral or carbon-negative emis-
sions;

P4. To identify technology development challenges for those tech-

nologies found to exhibit strong potential;

PThese aims are addressed firstly by reviewing the key drivers to
hybridisation. Following this, the key elements of concentrating
solar thermal technologies are reviewed, together with the key
parameters that influence their efficiency, with a view to identifying
the implications of these features on hybridisation. We then review
hybrids compatible with the steam Rankine cycle, despite its rela-
tively low efficiency, owing to its compatible temperature with CST,
suitability to use with tubular receivers and relevance to CO2 capture
technologies. Some of these approaches are also compatible with
emerging power cycles such as the CO2 power cycle [26(cid:1)29].
Approaches to hybridising CST with the air Brayton (gas turbine)
cycle are then reviewed, owing to the potential to operate at higher
temperature and hence achieve higher cycle efficiency than a Ran-
kine cycle. This leads to consideration of hybridising with chemical
looping combustion. Chemical looping is a class of reduction-oxida-
tion (redox) technology using metal oxides, which has received con-
siderable attention both in combustion-only cycles [30(cid:1)41], and in
solar-only cycles [1]. Chemical looping combustion uses an oxygen
carrier to oxidise the fuel (and reduce the carrier), following which
the metal particle is oxidised in air. This approach avoids direct con-
tact between the fuel and air to achieve inherent CO2 capture and
has been the subject of several reviews [41(cid:1)45]. Redox cycles under
development for solar thermochemical processes include those
directed to the splitting of water and CO2 [1, 46, 47]. Particular atten-
tion is paid in the present review to the hybrids between CST and
chemical looping combustion, in which the endothermic energy for
the reduction reaction is provided with CST. Thus, these cycles have
great potential for application in solar-combustion hybrids with

Pintegrated CO2 capture and re-use/sequestration, to separate O2
from air for oxy-fuel combustion [48] or to regenerate a fuel from
the captured CO2 [1]. Furthermore, the fuel reactor can potentially
also be used to provide energy dense storage of solar energy, com-
bining both chemical and sensible heat [18,19,49].

2. Key drivers to hybridise concentrating solar thermal energy
with combustion

2.1. Global drivers

PFig. 1 presents the IEA's anticipated mix of energy sources in the
year 2035 [50]. This assessment, which is similar to other major
assessments of future global energy supply [51], anticipates an ongo-
ing role for the combustion of both fossil fuels and biomass, despite a
rapidly growing contribution from intermittent renewable energy
sources such as solar and wind. This expectation of an ongoing need
for both energy sources leads to an economic driver to integrate
them, due to the economic advantages of hybridisation over stand-
alone systems. Furthermore, when combined with a low-carbon
fuel, such as one derived from biomass, such systems have potential
to achieve carbon-negative emissions, a component of which is
expected to be needed to meet the global CoP-21 emission targets
[52,53]. For example, Guo et al. [2], calculated that the solar thermal
gasification of a biomass that is 80% carbon-neutral, has potential to
achieve carbon negative production of Fisher Tropsch liquids, when
combined with CCS. The low-carbon syngas could alternatively be
used directly in a combustion plant to meet the need for process
heat, for example.

2.2. Firm supply

PHybridisation offers to CST the potential to increase the cost
effectiveness of thermal energy storage (TES) by enabling the capac-
ity of the TES to be optimised independent of any commitments to
meet supply. This is important on the one hand because of the grow-
ing demand for energy storage [54] and, on the other hand, because
the maximum economic utilisation of TES occurs at much smaller
storage capacities than that needed to maintain firm supply [55].
Furthermore, the much lower cost of the storage of heat relative to
that of electricity has been identified as a key driver for the ongoing
development of CST technology despite the rapidly reducing costs of
solar photo-voltaic (PV) for un-stored energy [54]. Hybridisation
also offers capacity for a CST plant to provide firm supply and to fur-
ther increase its capacity to provide other electrical services such as
inertia. The need to provide firm supply may often be greater for

Pchemical process plants than for electrical generation. This is firstly
because the demand is more difficult to turn down, secondly,
because it is often more difficult to harness distributed energy sour-
ces in a chemical process than in an electrical network and, thirdly,
because both process efficiency and product quality are greater with
steady-state than variable operation. Nevertheless, the present
review is limited to hybrids for power generation.

PFig. 2 presents the dependence of the calculated probability of
an unscheduled reduction in output from a single solar thermal
plant (electrical or chemical) due to solar resource variability as
a function of storage capacity for six sites of excellent solar
resource. This particular analysis was performed as the lower
limit of the amount of storage required to maintain supply, since
it assumes the storage device is 100% efficient and ignores the
exergetic losses associated with charging and discharging. How-
ever, it does account for the unavoidable need to dump energy
when the storage device is full. It can be seen that, even under
this best-case scenario, the capacity of a dedicated storage sys-
tem required to provide continuous output from a single genera-
tor is unlikely to be economic for the foreseeable future. For
example, for the case that the probability of an unscheduled
reduction is 0.3% (i.e. 1 day in 3 years), not only would the stor-
age capacity need to be between 50 and 300 hours (depending
on the site), but the peak capacity of the heliostat field relative
to the required input to the thermal conversion unit (e.g. power
block or chemical process) is a factor of ten [55]. This degree of
oversizing is so great that 90% of the energy is dumped at solar
noon in mid-summer, which would be very expensive. In addi-
tion, given that the capacity of the molten salt storage systems
employed in commercially available solar thermal plants is
12(cid:1)16 hours [56], substantial further development of the storage
technology would be required to achieve the required 50 (cid:1)
300 hours, even for this idealised system.

PThe above study also shows that the storage facility becomes
increasingly under utilized as the storage capacity of the plant is
increased above about 12 hours (depending on the site). That is, the
storage facility and the heliostat field must be progressively over-
sized to reduce the probability of an unscheduled shut-down, which
increases cost. Hence, while many other demand scenarios and turn-
down scenarios are possible than those shown here, this assessment
is sufficient to illustrate that it is likely to be uneconomic to provide
sufficient oversizing for firm supply under “worst-case” scenarios of
relatively rare periods of extended cloud cover. Instead, it will be
cheaper to design the storage facility to be near-fully utilised and to
provide the capacity for firm supply through an alternative approach
such as a hybrid [55]. Many other approaches are also under

with a growing role of renewable energy [50].

unit (TCU), based on a model of a plant that assumes steady state at each half-hour time-step from a 10-year time series of historical direct normal irradiance at six sites with
excellent resource. The peak capacity of the heliostat field is also a factor of 10 larger than that of the TCU [55]. Note: Alice Springs, Darwin and Mildura are in Australia, while
Albuquerque, Daggett and Prescott Love Field are in the USA.

Pdevelopment to contribute to meeting the challenge of matching
supply and demand with the use of intermittent renewable energy
at both the supply and demand end of the challenge. Nevertheless, a
significant component of firm supply is anticipated to be needed
into the future. Furthermore, it is also possible to generate fuels
renewably, including from the same plant using excess electricity
during high flux periods. These become tradable stored chemical
energy and are utilisable in a hybrid in the same way as a fossil fuel.

2.3. Technical compatibility

PTable 1 presents a high level comparison of the compatibility of
the four classes of thermal energy source for which hybrids have
been proposed or are already commercially available. These are the
combustion (of fossil, biomass and/or solar fuels), CST and geother-
mal energy. (Note that, although nuclear energy is also a type of
thermal energy, to the best of our knowledge, no hybrid system with
nuclear energy has been proposed to date1). Table 1 shows that com-
bustion and CST are the most compatible for hybridisation of these
three energy sources. Furthermore, combustion is also more widely
available than geothermal (and nuclear) power. Thus, hybrids
between CST and combustion are likely to be developed first and
also to be more prevalent than between any other types of thermal
energy sources in the short to medium term.

PThe key technical drivers to hybridise CST with combustion in
preference to other combinations of thermal energy sources (as
shown in Table 1), are as follows:

P(cid:3) Temperature compatibility: Of the renewable thermal energy
sources, CST is more compatible with combustion than is geo-
thermal because both can generate the maximum inlet

Ptemperatures of currently envisaged thermal power plant, cur-
rently »1350 °C for gas turbine power plant [58], while geother-
mal cannot. The relatively low temperature of geothermal
energy sources (typically < 300 °C) implies that they must inevi-
tably either provide only the low temperature heat into a high
temperature cycle, which will result in them providing only a
small fraction of the total energy of the plant, or else limit the
maximum temperature of the cycle, which would lower the
thermal efficiency of the plant.

P(cid:3) Availability compatibility: Of the three options for steady out-
put to complement the inherent variability of the solar resource,
combustion offers the lowest cost source of flexible high tem-
perature heat. The rapid response of combustion systems to a
change in demand has made natural gas open cycle gas turbines
the dominant form of peaking power plant with well-estab-
lished capacity to rapidly respond to changes in either supply or
demand [50]. The main limitation of the use of hydrogen-
derived fuels (e.g. NH3) or hydrogen-blended fuels (e.g. syngas)
is their availability and cost.

PSome of the options for solar-geothermal hybrids to be proposed
to date include solar super-heating of the working fluid with geo-
thermal energy and the geothermal pre-heating of the feedwater to
a solar thermal plant [59]. However, while the thermal efficiency of
a hybrid solar geothermal power plant is typically higher than that
of a stand-alone geothermal power plant, it is also lower than that of
a stand-alone solar power plant [60(cid:1)62]. This implies that there is
little incentive to hybridise solar with geothermal plants given the
alternative option to hybridise with combustion, which typically
lowers the cost of CST [5,6]. Furthermore, there is a relatively low
probability of co-location of high quality solar and geothermal

Presources, at least until such time as Engineered Geothermal Sys-
tems, sometimes known as “hot-dry rocks”, may potentially become
economically attractive. For example, locations at which geothermal
energy is presently attractive such as New Zealand and Iceland, do
not have a high quality solar resource. For these reasons, together
with those already discussed with regard to Table 1, it is reasonable
to conclude that the potential to hybridise CST with combustion is
much greater than that for CST and geothermal for the foreseeable
future.

3. Definitions and classification of thermal energy hybrids

3.3. Classification by comparison with the best alternative option

PHere the performance of the hybrid compared with the relevant
state-of-the-art stand-alone technology, after accounting for start-
up and shut-down losses. We further propose that the default refer-
ence combustion cycles be a gas turbine combined-cycle and an
open cycle gas turbine, as the most efficient power plants for sched-
ulable and peaking plant, respectively, while the default reference
cycle for a solar thermal plant is a two tank, molten salt plant. How-
ever, other reference cycles can be adopted as appropriate. The pro-
posed sub-classifications are:

PWe define a hybrid thermal process to be ‘a process that integrates
multiple types of thermal energy sources’. The word “integration”
implicitly implies an improvement, relative to the stand-alone coun-
terparts, in performance via reduced cost, decreased CO2 emissions
intensity, and/or increased dispatchability. This definition is more
general than those proposed previously. For example, Williams et al.
[24] define a solar hybrid system to be one that uses a combination
of solar and fossil energy to generate electricity. Such a definition is
limiting because it does not include non-fossil sources of combus-
tion or other applications than electricity generation.

PGiven the wide range of systems that can be identified as a hybrid
under the above definition, we further propose a series of classifica-
tions with which to compare different types of thermal hybrid.
While the focus here is on CST-combustion hybrids, the classifica-
tions are more broadly applicable:

3.1. Classification by solar share

PThe solar share is typically defined as the fraction of the input
energy that is derived from a solar source. Importantly, this should
be based on the annually averaged values derived from unsteady cal-
culations of historical time-series to fully account for solar resource
variability. The proposed classes and ranges of solar share are as
follows:

Pa. Solar Aided Combustion Generation (<33% solar, annually aver-
aged). This name is adapted from the name “Solar Aided Power
Generation” given to the use of solar feedwater preheating in a
Rankine Cycle [12,63], where 30% is approximately the upper
limit of energy that can be provided in this way [64].

Pb. Balanced Solar-Combustion Generation (33(cid:1)66% solar, annually

averaged);

Pc. Combustion Aided Solar Generation (>66% Solar, annually

averaged)

3.2. Classification by extent of integration

PHere, the criterion assesses the extent of integration between CST
and combustion (or other energy sources), and hence the relative
potential to reduce capital cost and energy losses through hybridisa-
tion. Hence, the proposed sub-classifications are as follows:

P(cid:3) Auxiliary: shares only the supporting infrastructure, such as

electrical cabling and control systems;

P(cid:3) Indirect: Transfers reactants and/or products from a solar ther-
mochemical cycle to a power cycle, together with the auxiliary
infrastructure;

P(cid:3) Semi-direct: Shares the major non-solar components of the
solar and combustion power cycle (e.g. the turbine and the con-
denser), together with the auxiliary infrastructure;

P(cid:3) Direct: shares the solar and combustion thermal harvesting
equipment (e.g. receiver and combustor), together with the
semi-direct and auxiliary components;

Pa. Solar positive (cid:1) combustion negative hybrid: A system effi-
ciency that equals or exceeds the efficiency of the relevant
state-of-the-art solar-only system, but not of the relevant state-
of-the-art combustion plant;

Pb. Solar negative (cid:1) combustion positive hybrid: A system effi-
ciency that equals or exceeds the efficiency of the relevant
state-of-the-art combustion-only system, but not of the relevant
state-of-the-art solar plant;

Pc. Solar positive (cid:1) Combustion positive hybrid: A system effi-
ciency that equals or exceeds the efficiency of both the relevant
state-of-the-art solar system and of the relevant state-of-the-art
combustion-only plant.

PIt is important to note that the above comparisons should be
based on case-by-case, dynamic assessment over a one year period.
This is because the net benefit from a hybrid will depend on a range
of case-specific conditions, including the solar resource variability.
For example, it is possible that a net benefit may still be derived
from a hybrid whose steady-state operation may be poorer than the
stand-alone counterpart because of the role of compensating bene-
fits such as avoided (or reduced) start-up and shut-down losses and
less total infrastructure.

4. General considerations of solar thermal power generation

PThe efficiency of solar thermal power generation hsolar-to-work is
determined by the product of: (1) the efficiency of concentrating the
direct solar normal irradiation (DNI) hconc, (2) the efficiency of
absorption of the high-temperature heat by the solar receiver hrec ,
and (3) the conversion into power by the heat engine hheat-engine. The
limitations and trends of these combined influences is illustrated
by considering: the theoretical maximum efficiency for an ideal
solar concentrator (no reflectivity or spillage losses), an ideal solar
receiver (no convection/conduction heat losses and blackbody
absorption), and an ideal heat engine. For this case, the maximum
theoretical solar-to-work energy conversion efficiency of an ideal
system is given by [1],

where C is the mean solar flux concentration ratio over the receiver's
aperture area, normalized by the DNI I, s is the Stefan-Boltzmann
constant, and TH and TL are the upper and lower operating tempera-
tures of the equivalent Carnot heat engine, respectively. This ideal
solar-to-work efficiency hsolar-to-work,ideal is plotted in Fig. 3 as a func-
tion of TH, for TL = 298 K, and for various solar flux concentration
ratios. From the perspective of the Carnot cycle alone, it is desirable
to operate the heat engine at the highest possible temperature,
assuming that the cold reservoir temperature, TL is that of the atmo-
sphere. However, from the perspective of the solar receiver alone, it
is desirable to lower TH to minimise the re-radiation losses (as well
as the convective/conductive heat losses). This results in the opti-
mum temperature for the power-plant-receiver combination, Topti-
mum, being lower than that for the power cycle alone (i.e. a non-solar

Ppower plant), as shown in Fig. 3. In practice, when considering con-
vection/conduction losses in addition to radiation losses, the effi-
ciency will peak at a temperature even lower than that shown, while
the efficiency will also be lower owing to the use of cycles less effi-
cient than Carnot. Furthermore, the need to operate throughout the
solar year also implies that the concentration ratio will sometimes
be lower than the design value, requiring operation over a range of
values of C in practice.

PFrom Fig. 3 we can derive the following important implications

for solar hybrid systems:

P1. There is an incentive to minimise re-radiation losses from a solar
receiver, which does not apply to combustion plant. This may
lower the optimal temperature of the hybrid relative to that of
the combustion process. Notwithstanding this, re-radiation
losses can be reduced by increasing the concentration ratio of
the concentrating optics, although the associated increase in
efficiency must be weighed against the additional cost of high-
precision concentrating optics.

P2. There is an incentive to operate the solar receiver at higher temper-
atures for coupling to more-efficient heat engines. However, the
associated increase in efficiency must be weighed against the addi-
tional cost of high-temperature materials. Where air is the working
fluid, the enthalpy of combustion does not need to be transferred
through a wall, offering the potential to mitigate this limitation.
P3. In a hybrid, there is an incentive to introduce the enthalpy of
from the
combustion downstream, rather than upstream,
receiver. This increases the temperature of the power cycle
above that of the receiver, reducing the limitation of the re-radi-
ation losses described above. Several potential routes to achieve
this are discussed below, with the use of hybrid chemical loop-
ing cycles offering a particular significant opportunity because it
also offers the potential for both stored high temperature output
and integrated CO2 capture.

PThe dependence of radiation losses on the fourth power of tem-
perature also has important implications on the shape of the
receiver, and hence also on the maximum thermal scale. For

Ptemperatures below »600 °C, radiation losses from a solar receiver
can be managed by careful choice of the surface material to yield
low emissivity in this temperature range. This allows the use of the
“surround field” configuration, in which a tower-mounted tubular
receiver is surrounded by heliostats, allowing radiation to be col-
lected from all directions (see Fig. 4a). The collection of radiation
from all directions allows the greatest thermal input that is possible
for a single tower, which maximises the economies of scale, mini-
mises the surface area to volume ratio and also offers some advan-
tages in managing the variability of the solar resource by careful
control of the heliostat focus. On the other hand, the use of a cavity
receiver makes use of the lower radiation losses from a cavity and
therefore becomes increasingly advantageous for higher tempera-
ture cycles or processes (see Fig. 4b). Nevertheless, cavity receivers
suffer from the disadvantage of a lower thermal capacity due to
the need to limit the collection angle from the field and due to the
greater precision required from the heliostats to concentrate the
radiation into the aperture of the cavity receiver, together with a
degradation in-efficiency at larger distances from the tower. The
beam down option offers another possibility to increase the thermal
scale, reduce capital cost and heat losses. However, this option also
suffers from reduced concentrating ratio resulting in reduced overall
efficiency, together with increased vibration and the anticipated
requirement for a large secondary concentrator on the tower, so that
the conditions for which a net benefit can be derived is yet to be ade-
quately evaluated. The third class of receiver, termed a “billboard”
receiver is intermediate between these. It has a flat receiver that also
collects from a narrow field angle. The above considerations of solar
receivers have the following further implications on solar combus-
tion hybrids:

P(cid:3) Lower temperature cycles, such as the Rankine cycle, are suit-
able for either surround field or bill-board style receivers. These
types of receivers are difficult to hybridise at the receiver, so
must be hybridised in other ways. Also the relatively low effi-
ciency of these cycles implies that hybridisation without carbon
capture will be “combustion negative” (i.e. lower efficiency than
other combustion options);

Fig. 4. The two main classes of tower-mounted solar receiver, namely (left) a surround field, which collects radiation from all 360° allowing the largest possible thermal scale but
also suffers from relatively high radiation losses, and (right) a cavity receiver, which collects from a narrow arc generated by a polar field to yield much lower radiation losses, but
at the expense of a smaller field, adapted with permission from [65].

P(cid:3) Higher temperature cycles, such as the Brayton cycle, are most
compatible with cavity receivers. Cavity receivers offer the
opportunity to hybridise the receiver by introducing combustion
into it, but are limited to a smaller scale by the need to collect
from a smaller segment of the heliostat field.

5. Hybridising with the steam side of a Rankine cycle

5.1. General options to hybridise a steam cycle

PA wide range of options for hybridising a Rankine cycle are avail-
able, particularly for cycles involving CO2 capture, for either storage

Por re-use, since solar energy can potentially be added not only to the
working fluid (i.e. the steam), but also to the reactants and/or prod-
ucts (discussed in section ). The two main options for adding solar
thermal heat to the working fluid in a semi-direct hybrid system are
shown diagrammatically in Fig. 5. These two options, which could
potentially be employed together in the same power plant, are as
follows:

P(cid:3) Provision of low temperature solar heat, Qsol,LT, typically less
than 300 °C, notably to heat the feedwater to the boiler. Multiple
stages of feedwater preheating are typically employed, although
only one is shown in Fig. 5 for clarity. This low temperature
heating has the dual advantages of allowing the use of low-cost

Fig. 5. Basic options for thermal indirect hybridisation of solar heat into the steam side of a Rankine cycle powered by combustion technology. The use of solar feed-water heating
displaces the higher temperature steam, which is otherwise “bled” from the turbine in a regenerative Rankine cycle, to achieve higher thermodynamic efficiency than a stand-
alone solar system of the same temperature.

Psolar concentrators and also of achieving thermodynamic lever-
age in a regenerative Rankine cycle since it displaces higher
temperature steam that is otherwise extracted from the turbine
to heat the feedwater (Table 2). In this way solar feedwater pre-
heating achieves higher efficiency than is possible from a solar-
only cycle at the same temperature [64]. However, it has the dis-
advantage of achieving a relatively low solar share of typically
less than 8% if employed as the only solar input to a power cycle
[66]. In addition, the cost of commercially-available low temper-
ature thermal storage is presently relatively high due to its rela-
tively low energy density, although this may change as new TES
technologies emerge;

P(cid:3) Provision of high temperature solar heat, Qsol,HT, to meet the
high temperature boiling and superheating loads of a boiler.
This can be performed either directly with the working fluid,
typically steam, or with a separate heat transfer fluid, such as
molten salt, which is the leading commercially available heat
transfer fluid for which thermal storage of up to 13 hours capac-
ity has been demonstrated [67]. Hence a major advantage of the
high temperature hybridisation is its compatibility with thermal
storage, which increases the solar share of the process (Table 2).
The temperature limit of currently available commercial tech-
nology is approximately 650 °C [67], due to the temperature
limit of the molten salt heat transfer fluids employed, although
this is expected to increase as commercial systems for other
heat transfer fluids are developed. Another disadvantage of this
approach to hybridisation is the inefficient heat transfer associ-
ated with indirect heat transfer process through tubes, together
with the materials limitations. However the other limitation is
associated with the use of the Rankine cycle, whose efficiency is
relatively low;

PFig. 5 also illustrates a key disadvantage of a semi-direct hybrid
system, in that two sets of heat exchangers are required to collect
(or transfer) each of the high and low sources of temperature heat.
That is, the solar heat is collected when it is available with the solar
receiver, while the alternate component is employed to harvest the
enthalpy of combustion when the solar resource is insufficient. The
need to operate two devices intermittently results in additional
heat losses over what would be possible with operation of a single
device, particularly when the transients are significant, which in
turn, generates the incentive to replace these two components with
the single component counterpart of a direct hybrid. While direct
hybrids are not yet commercially available, they are now under
development [6, 68-70].

5.2. Specific options for low temperature Rankine cycle hybridisation

PDespite its limitations of a relatively low efficiency, the Rankine
cycle is not only the dominant thermal power cycle in use today, it is
also expected to continue to be important because of its relatively
low cost and high reliability, together with its relevance to combined
heat and power. The Rankine cycle is incorporated into the majority

Pof contemporary base load thermal power stations in the world, for
coal, biomass and waste fuels [63]. It is also used as the bottoming
cycle in the more efficient natural gas combined cycle power genera-
tors. Furthermore, it is the dominant power cycle for solar thermal
power generation because its relatively low temperature is compati-
ble with solar receivers and thermal storage technologies as is noted
above. However, its relatively low efficiency also offers an opportu-
nity to achieve highly efficient and relatively low cost solar boosting
through a process termed Solar Aided Power Generation. While this
approach has typically been considered for boosting of coal-fired
boilers in the past, it is not limited to these applications and can also
be used in combination with other energy sources and cycles, as is
explained in Fig. 5.

PModern power stations typically employ a regenerative Rankine
cycle, which modifies the basic Rankine cycle to increase the thermal
efficiency. In the regenerative Rankine cycle, part of the steam from
each of the stages of the turbine is extracted to pre-heat the feed-
water to the boiler in Feed-water Heaters (FWHs). This offers the
potential to employ solar heat (or indeed for another source of low
grade heat including geothermal) to heat the feedwater and thereby
displace the extracted steam and allow it to continue to expand
through the turbine to generate additional work. The key feature of
this approach, typically referred to as Solar Aided Power Generation,
SAPG [12,63], is that the solar heat does not enter the turbines
directly so that the thermal efficiency of the solar power is capped
by the temperature of the boiler rather than that of the solar collec-
tor [10]. This allows higher efficiency for the solar plant than is pos-
sible for a solar-only cycle at the same receiver temperature and also
allows the use of lower cost concentrators for this solar boosting
step. However, this is achieved at the expense of a lower solar share
and can also be limited by practical considerations such as the turn-
down capability of the steam turbine.

PA schematic diagram of a typical SAPG configuration is presented
in Fig. 6 [71]. This shows that the heat provided to the FWHs is typi-
cally required at temperatures ranging from 90-350 °C. At these rela-
tively low temperatures, relatively low cost concentrators can be
employed and the heat losses can also be managed to achieve rela-
tively high collection efficiency. Indeed, while previous assessments
of SAPG have only considered solar concentrators [72,73], the lower
end of its temperature range can even be provided by non-concen-
trating technologies. The net solar (to power) efficiency of non-con-
centrating solar collectors has potential to be even greater than that
from higher temperature concentrators [74].

PFig. 7 presents the calculated steady-state efficiency of the input
of SAPG into different types of cycle for a range of temperature
inputs. It can be seen that the use of low temperature heat in a SAPG
cycle is 2 to 3 times more efficient than in the stand-alone cycle at
the same temperature of the solar receiver. Furthermore, the effi-
ciency boost is greatest for the super-critical cycle owing to the
higher temperature of the displaced steam (typically at 350 °C) in
the super-critical cycle over the sub-critical counterpart (typically at
330 °C). In addition, the extent of the boost increases as the tempera-
ture of the renewable input decreases, owing to the greater

Pdifference between the boiler temperature and the renewable tem-
perature. Finally it can also be seen that, for the case in which the
solar (or geothermal) input is provided at 260 °C to the super-critical
boiler, the efficiency of the solar power in the SAPG is 45.3%, which
is higher than the Carnot efficiency of 42.2% at the same solar tem-
perature of 260 °C [9]. This trend is consistent with those reported
for other assessments with the lower temperature range [10,75].

PFig. 8, which is modified from previous work [76], presents the
instantaneous solar share at various solar input temperatures. The
instantaneous solar share is defined as instantaneous solar heat
input on the (instantaneous) boiler thermal load. The other way to

Pdefine the solar share is the solar input on the total plant thermal
loads including boiler load and solar heat input. The instantaneous
solar share (in terms of Qsolar/Qboiler) is only »5%, when solar thermal
input is provided at 90 °C, while it approaches »25% at 260 °C in the
super-critical case. While data for the annually averaged solar
share are not available,
it is reasonable to anticipate that this
could approach »17% with sufficient storage, which is a worthwhile
target.

PThe possibility of operating a SAPG plant in either the Power
Boost or Fuel-Saver modes was first noted by Kolb [5]. These models
are illustrated qualitatively in Fig. 9 [11]. The power boosting mode

Presults in additional power being generated when the solar resource
is available without changing the fuel consumption of the boiler,
while the fuel-saving mode maintains a constant generating capacity
by reducing the fuel consumption from the boiler. The power-boost
mode typical offers greatest economic return either from reducing
the need to install additional generating capacity [5] or from the
potential to sell more power during periods of high demand, with
the associated high price of power. Furthermore, the extent of fuel-
savings in the Fuel-Saver mode may be less than the solar input
because the efficiency of the boiler typically reduces with turn-
down. Perhaps more significantly, the extent to which SAPG can be
implemented in a retrofit configuration is limited by the design
point of the turbine and a range of practical constraints [66]. These
include limited land-access for solar concentrators and a limited
solar resource at many pre-existing sites. It was found that the
annual solar share of a 300 MW power plant in Greece was only
about 7.91% (120,000 m2 solar collectors) [73]. However, no assess-
ment of the potential for new plant that incorporated SAPG together
with other CO2 mitigation strategies has been performed to date to
the best of our knowledge.

PHere DWe is the increased power output (from the plant) due to
the solar heat input, Qsolar is solar heat transferred into feedwater,
and DQboiler is the possible change of the boiler load after solar input
[12].

PIf the SAPG plant is operated in the power boosting mode, DWe
could be determined relatively easily, as the difference between the
output from the power plant with and without a solar heat input.
However, it is not straightforward to determine the values of hse or
DWe, in the fuel saving mode, because the output from the turbine
does not change significantly with the solar input. Two possible
ways to quantify hse or DWe, for the fuel saving mode are as follows:

P(1) The annual solar power generation (Esolar,a), i.e. annual DWe, can
be defined as that component of the electricity generated by
solar energy [73], as follows:

the reference fuel-fired power unit in the nth hour [72,73]. However,
this method of calculation over-estimates the solar contribution
because it does not consider the efficiency changes of the boiler

P(2) In the absence of measured data of boiler efficiency with turn
it is possible to estimate DWe from the difference
down,
between the plant's power output at a reduced boiler flow rate
(in fuel saving mode) but without any solar input, and the
designed plant's output [74]. This approach requires the effi-
ciency changes of the turbine with turn down to be known or
estimated.

PThe two DWe definitions described above can be used to bench-mark
solar performance in the fuel saving mode against power boosting
mode. However, neither the estimates of hse or DWe are absolute.

PThe performance of an SAPG plant also depends on the detailed
configuration of the connections to the plant's feedwater heaters
and the operational strategies adopted to adjust the flow-rates of
extraction steam with variation in the solar input [77,78]. Of the 12
possible “configuration and operation” combinations, it found when
all the extraction steam to the displaced feed water heaters (FWHs)
has been displaced by the solar thermal energy, SAPG plant's techni-
cal performance would be identical for all 12 proposed combina-
tions. However, when for reduced quantities of displaced steam, a
particular configuration has the highest annual solar share, annual
solar power output per collector area and solar thermal to power
efficiency [77]. In addition, the operation of the non-displaced FHWs
also has an impact on performance of the SAPG plant [78]. That is,
adopting the constant temperature flow (CT) strategy for each non-
displaced FWHs is generally better than that adopting the constant
mass flow (CM) strategy. However, if the SAPG plant is to be located
in a region of rich solar resource, a SAPG plant adopting the CM strat-
egy can achieve better performance [78].

PPrevious economic evaluations on the use of SAPG with coal-fired
boilers have shown that it increases the LCOE [79] comparing with
coal fired power generation without CO2 mitigation. However, the
LCOE of the SAPG plant is lower than the same size of solar-only
power plant [73]. In addition, while there is an optimal solar area for
an SAPG plant to achieve the lowest LCOE [80,81], these previous

Passessments do not account for resource variability. The economic
potential of the use of power boosting to capitalise on the market
pricing using SAPG is yet to be evaluated either for use with a coal-
fired boiler or for alternative system configurations including other
types of system with lower net CO2 emissions such as those shown
in Fig. 5. Similarly, there is significant potential to develop alterna-
tive configurations of FWH and solar plant configuration to further
lower the cost of SAPG.

5.3. Specific options for high temperature Rankine and emerging
efficient cycles

PThe Hybrid Solar Receiver Combustor, HSRC, is a new patented
concept that integrates the combustion system within a solar cavity
receiver [6], shown in Fig. 10. The cavity receiver is fitted with multi-
ple burners to heat the same heat exchanger that is also used for the
solar mode. Heat is recovered from the exhaust gases and is used to
preheat the combustion air and to provide an aerodynamic curtain
as described below. Noteworthy is that cavity receivers are well
suited to high temperatures due to their lower radiation losses,
when compared to other configurations, but are currently limited in
scale, as is described above [82]. The HSRC can be operated in three
modes:

P(cid:3) Solar-only: here the operation is similar to a conventional solar-

only device.

P(cid:3) Combustion-only: here the aperture is sealed with a flap to
avoid the additional radiation and convection losses during the
combustion-only mode. The device incorporates heat recovery
from the combustion products to pre-heat the combustion air.
The heat transfer to the heat transfer fluid is similar to a stand-
alone combustor [22,23], although additional exergy losses may
be incurred relative to heating the working fluid directly.

P(cid:3) Mixed mode: here the two energy sources can be introduced at
the same time, which offers the potential to manage rapid
changes in solar heat flux and/or operate at lower solar heat

Pfluxes than would otherwise be possible [6]. Net benefits are
anticipated, despite some additional heat losses through the
open aperture.

PThe integration of the combustor and solar receiver has the
advantages of reduced infrastructure relative to a back-up combus-
tion system (such as a stand-alone boiler on the same site), reduced
losses from both start-up/shut-down and heat exchange surface
area and greater capacity to manage heat flux during periods of rapid
change in solar resource. On the other hand, it has the disadvantage
of a compromised receiver-combustor design to extract the heat effi-
ciently from both a radiation source (solar energy) and a combined
radiation and convection source (combustion energy). An added dis-
advantage is the additional control required to address the challenge
of a potential reduction in thermal efficiency during mixed mode
operation arising from hot products escaping the cavity or cold air
(induced by wind) entering the cavity. The combustion-related chal-
lenges associated with operation in the mixed mode have recently
been reviewed [3]. However, the technology-related challenges have
not been reviewed before. Therefore this section addresses this need
for the HSRC.

PLim et al. [22] conducted a techno-economic assessment using a
piecewise-continuous (i.e. pseudo-dynamic) model that accounts for
solar variability on performance for different sites with high DNI.
They compared the performance of the HSRC with a conventional
standalone solar system backed up by a conventional boiler (termed
a Solar Gas Hybrid system) sharing the same power block. They
found that, for a 100 MWth system, the Hybrid Solar Receiver-Com-
bustor (HSRC) reduces the net fuel consumption relative to the
equivalent Solar Gas Hybrid system by 12% to 31% depending on the
size of thermal storage capacity. The benefits were attributed pre-
dominantly to the avoidance by the HSRC of the start-up and shut-
down losses of the backup boiler of the SGH [22,83]. In addition, sig-
nificant benefit is also derived from the reduced electrical energy
consumption from the trace heating associated with the need to pre-
vent molten salt from solidification. The combined value of these
benefits is a reduction in the Levelised Cost of Electricity (LCOE) by
up to 19%, depending on the price of the natural gas [22].

PTo achieve a reasonable match in the heat flux profile across the
different modes, while also achieving low NOX emissions, the use of

PModerate or Intense Low oxygen Dilution, MILD, combustion has
been proposed. MILD combustion is characterised by a volumetric
reaction, high recirculation, wide stability limits, low pollutant emis-
sions and a relatively uniform temperature distribution [84(cid:1)86].
These features increase the thermal efficiency of the system, provide
a more distributed heat flux to the heat exchanger and maintain a
clean combustion process. Low sensitivity to variation in external air
ingress into the cavity is also anticipated. To mitigate the convective
heat losses during operation in the mixed mode, the use of an aero-
dynamic curtain (i.e. a fluidic “seal” ) using the combustion exhaust
gases has been proposed, as is illustrated in Fig. 10. This aerody-
namic curtain is under development to reduce the external air flow
into the cavity without the use of a window. Noteworthy, is that the
MILD combustion mode operates with high level of exhaust gas
recirculation and any part of the shielding gas that enters the cavity
is expected to be manageable through a control system and a sensor
of the O2 concentration at the exhaust. Lim et al. [68], also consid-
ered the potential benefits of integrating MILD combustion with the
HSRC. They found that there is potential to achieve up to 41% in fuel
saving and 4% saving in LCOE for the MILD HSRC relative to the HSRC
operating with conventional combustion for a receiver size of 30
MWth.

PFig. 11 presents the effect of the cavity length to diameter ratio
on heat transfer and its impact on thermal efficiency. From this Fig.
it is clear that for Lc/Dc > 4 the thermal efficiency can be higher than
a standard boiler for several scenarios. For example, the rate of hot
combustion products recirculation (denoted by S as the ratio of
recirculated versus exhausted gases) which provides a favourable
thermal efficiency is found to be 75:25 (75% of the hot combustion
products recirculated directly and 25% released via exhaust). The
figure also shows that MILD combustion has potential to increase
heat transfer and efficiency from the high rates of heat transfer to
the heat transfer fluid.

PChinnici et al. [69,70] conducted an extensive CFD study to inves-
tigate the thermal performance of the HSRC under the three operat-
ing modes for a range of design and operating parameters. They
confirmed many of the findings of the analytical models presented
by Lim et al. [22,23,68] and showed that it is possible to select a
HSRC geometry that provides similar efficiency under the three
modes, with low energy losses. Configurations suitable for achieving

Fig. 11. Effect of varying the length to the diameter ratio of the Hybrid Solar Receiver Combustor (HSRC) on the overall thermal efficiency for an overall output of 30MWth. Results
are reported for several configurations of MILD combustion and the conventional combustion for a range of assumed values of Heat Transfer Improvements (HTI) from use of the
MILD combustion mode spanning the range of 0 - 30%. Various configurations of split ratios of recirculated gases of ??= 75:25 and ??= 60:40 are also shown. The performance of a
conventional combustion boiler is also shown for reference, adapted with permission from [68].

PHTF temperatures of up to 800 °C were also identified under realistic
assumptions. These temperatures are greater than those usually
employed for Rankine cycles and demonstrate the compatibility of
the two energy sources and their suitability for integration.

PRecent unpublished work at The University of Adelaide has
provided further support for the findings reported above using a
20 kWth experimental prototype of the HSRC. Using natural gas as a
fuel and a 5 kWe Xenon lamp (to simulate solar radiation), the
device has operated at thermal efficiency of up to 88% in all three of
the three modes of operation (i.e. solar only, combustion only and
the mixed mode), with measured NOx and CO concentration in
exhaust of less than 5 ppm and 100 ppm, respectively.

5.4. Critical research challenges for the HSRC

PThe research challenges of greatest priority to support the further
development of the HSRC technology can be summarised to be as
follows:

P1. Better understanding the scaling parameters that will allow the
effective operation under the three modes at greater thermal
scale;

P2. Development of fuel flexible burners to allow the use of alterna-
tive fuels; such as syngas, ammonia or hydrogen within a highly
confined reactor;

P3. On-sun testing of larger scale HSRC to identify any unforeseen
potential practical problems and assess methods with which to
manage solar flux variability;

P4. Development of control systems that mitigate destructive ther-
mal stresses due to rapid reductions in solar flux induced by the
passing of clouds by ramping up the combustion system to com-
pensate for short term reductions in solar flux;

P5. Developing effective strategies to mitigate convective losses
through the aperture (e.g. through aerodynamic curtains) and
increase efficiency in the mixed mode;

P6. Investigating the feasibility of utilizing the HSRC technology for

combined heat and power.

6. Hybridising via the fuel or oxidant

6.1. General options to hybridise with the fuel side of a power cycle

PA range of additional options for hybridising CST with combus-
tion technologies are emerging from the plethora of new technolo-
gies under development for CO2 mitigation. One class of these

Ptechnologies are associated with the range of options for introducing
thermal energy into the fuel side of a combustion process for which
carbon capture technology is potentially applicable. These are appli-
cable to a range of power cycles including the Rankine and Brayton
cycles, but also to alternative power cycles under development
such as the CO2 Thermodynamic Cycle. These options, illustrated in
Fig. 12, are as follows:

P(cid:3) Solar thermal fuel upgrading: CST can be used to drive a wide
range of endothermic reactions to increase the heating value of
a fuel, such as through the gasification of solid carbonaceous
feedstocks or solar steam reforming of natural gas [87]. This
approach offers potential to increase the heating value of the
original fuel by up to 40% depending on the carbon-hydrogen
ratio of the feedstock and 20% of natural gas [88]. This would
correspond directly to a reduction in the net carbon intensity of
the process if the fuel were to be upgraded entirely with renew-
able energy and if the fuel were to be utilised with the same effi-
ciency in the power generation plant. However, the conversion
of a solid fuel into syngas introduces some parasitic losses. The
production of a gaseous fuel enables it to be used in as a gas-tur-
bine or combined cycle as an alternative to a Rankine Cycle, or
to other thermodynamic cycles under development. However,
further work is required to better evaluate the relative techno-
economic merits of these various options for CO2 mitigation. For
example, the present cost of CO2 capture from a Brayton cycle is
more expensive and energy intensive than for the Rankine cycle.
P(cid:3) Solar thermal oxygen production: Technologies are also under
development to employ CST to drive the endothermic reactions
for oxygen production from the thermochemical splitting of
water or thermochemical oxygen separation [48,89,90]. The for-
mer process is targeted at the production of H2 and CO from H2O
and CO2 [91,92], although pure O2 or O2-rich inert gas can also
be co-produced. Similarly technologies are also under develop-
ment for thermochemical energy storage that offer potential for
the co-production of industrially pure O2 with power [90,93,94].
Solar oxygen production has potential to avoid the 0.4 kW h/m3
parasitic loss that is associated with the present state-of-the art
in oxygen production via cryogenic air separation that is needed
to enable CO2 capture via oxy-fuel combustion [95,96]. How-
ever, considerable work is required to better evaluate both the
net CO2 mitigation after all energy requirements of the process
are considered, together with the relative techno-economic
potential of the various technology options under development
for oxygen production with CST, particularly in a manner that
reliably accounts for the variability of the solar resource. In

Fig. 12. Basic options for hybridising solar thermal heat (thermo-chemically) into a Rankine cycle with CO2 capture, or into another combustion with near-stoichiometric ratios of
fuel to air.

Pparticular, the purity of oxygen produced in thermo-chemical
splitting of water depends on the method used to achieve a low
partial pressure of O2 in the reduction reactor. While high purity
O2 can be produced with a vacuum, this approach incurs the par-
asitic losses of generating a vacuum. On the other hand the costs
of vacuum production can be avoided by use of CO2 as the purge
gas in the reduction reactor, although this comes with the pen-
alty of making oxygen storage more expensive.

P(cid:3) Solar thermal CO2 reuse: A range of technologies are under
development to employ CST to regenerate CO2 into a fuel [1].
These technologies have potential to be used to regenerate the
CO2 captured from combustion processes (Fig. 12). Nevertheless,
these technologies can be considered to be an indirect approach
to hybridisation and are also in the early stage of development.
Hence they are considered to be beyond the scope of the present
review.

PTable 3 presents a summary of the advantages and disadvantages
of the various options presented above. It can be seen that, while
there is significant potential for these approaches, they are at a rela-
tively early stage of development so that further research and tech-
nology development is required to realise this potential.

7. Hybridising with a Brayton cycle

7.1. The need to consider CO2 capture

PThe Brayton cycle, which is the present state-of-the-art in heat
engines for power generation, is particularly well suited to the com-
bustion process because its use of air as the working fluid allows the
enthalpy of combustion to be added directly to the pressurised fluid
through the chemical reaction. This direct process of heat addition
avoids the need to transfer heat to a high pressure fluid through a
wall. This, in turn, avoids both the exergy loss of indirect heat trans-
fer and the need for expensive and specification-constrained materi-
als that must provide both high rates of heat transfer and resistance
to high temperature and pressure. In this respect the Brayton cycle
is better suited to combustion than solar thermal, because the low
absorptivity of the solar spectrum by air makes it necessary to rely
on indirect heat transfer. On the other hand, the use of combustion
must bear the compensating penalty of the need to achieve zero-net
CO2 emissions, which brings alternative penalties that offset, and
can even outweigh, the above advantages. Although a few sources of
low-carbon gaseous fuel are available (e.g. from methane generated
from the digestion of biomass), its future use with natural gas will

Prequire either CO2 capture, whose penalty is greater than for a Ran-
kine cycle owing to the higher dilution of CO2 in the exhaust [97].
Alternatively, carbon-neutral fuels, such as those derived from
renewable energy, are another option although this path is likely to
be energy intensive and expensive in the immediate future. On the
other hand, a CST hybridised Brayton cycle requires either that the
radiation be transmitted through a window to a radiation absorbing
surface, which is technically challenging and expensive, or that the
heat be added indirectly, either through a conducting, high pressure
materials or through an indirect process such as via particles. These
points explain why a CST Brayton cycle is typically less efficient than
a combustion cycle without carbon capture, but have strong poten-
tial to achieve comparable efficiencies to a carbon neutral combus-
tion cycle. Furthermore, hybridising offers potential to achieve
higher net efficiency than either of the stand-alone processes for a
given level of CO2 mitigation.

PBrayton cycles are employed in one of two configurations, each of
which performs a different function in power networks that must be
considered separately in their comparison with a CST hybrid. These
two options are:

P(cid:3) Open cycle gas turbines (OCGT): These are predominantly used
to provide peaking power, owing to their high availability and
short start-up time. They are used to meet periods of relatively
high demand that can result either from peak periods of uncon-
trolled demand or to compensate for the rapid reduction in
power that arises from the cessation in supply from intermittent
generation from wind-power and/or solar PV without electrical
storage. The efficiency of current open-cycle gas turbines for
power generation typically spans the range 35(cid:1)40%, depending
on the scale, so that the efficiency increases with thermal input
[98(cid:1)102]. In addition, no CO2 capture technology has yet been
proposed for OCGT. This is because the cost penalty for CO2 cap-
ture will increase very significantly for peaking plant, since the
capital cost for the capture technology must be repaid over a rel-
atively short operating time through the year;

P(cid:3) Combined cycle gas turbines (CCGT): While CCGT offer much
greater efficiency over OCGT of 55(cid:1)60%, also depending both on
scale and on the ambient temperature. These have a longer
start-up time caused by the greater inertia of the steam turbine
cycle, which limits their application for peaking load.

PThe need to integrate CO2 capture with an intermittent combus-
tion system generates a further opportunity for hybrid technology,
particularly for higher temperature cycles such as the Brayton cycle.

PBrayton cycle of a combined cycle plant can be converted into elec-
tricity with a solar to electrical efficiency of up to 30% [106(cid:1)108].

PIn a hybrid solar Brayton cycle, the combustion of a fuel is
employed together with the concentrated solar thermal energy to
heat the pressurised air before introduction to the gas turbine [109].
The potential points in a Brayton cycle into which solar thermal
energy can be added to the system are shown in Fig. 13. While solar
thermal energy could hypothetically be used to preheat atmospheric
air prior to its introduction to the compressor, this increases the
work required for compression, which decreases the efficiency of
the cycle, even though it enables the use of volumetric air preheat-
ers. On the other hand, heating the air after compression introduces
the challenge of sealing the high pressure air stream, although this
comes with the benefit of a higher heat transfer coefficient.
Several high temperature solar air heaters suitable for pressurised
air have been experimentally demonstrated at laboratory scale
[105,110,111]. An after-burner can also be employed both to close
the temperature gap between the receiver outlet temperature and
the desired turbine inlet temperatures of »1300 °C and to compen-
sate for any reduction in the fluctuating solar input relative to the
design value [109,112]. In a such a hybrid, the solar share increases
with the temperature of the output pressurised air from the solar
receiver [6], highlighting the significance of the receiver. Also, while
TES has not been demonstrated at these temperatures, several tech-
nologies are under development that target these temperatures,
such as the porous bed technologies with a thermocline [113,114].
Nevertheless, thermal storage would only make sense in a hybrid
device where combustion is used to provide a small supplement to
the solar energy. Otherwise, the additional losses from the storage
device and from operating at a lower temperature, than is possible
with a combustion-only device, can outweigh the gains [7].

PVarious configurations of solar receivers for heating pressurised
air have been proposed, using either directly or indirectly irradiated
concepts. For directly irradiation configurations, such as the one
developed at DLR (Figs. 14 & 15) and the small particle solar receiver
designed at San Diego State University [115], the working fluid is
heated by a volumetric absorber that is directly exposed to concen-
trated solar radiation. This provides an efficient means of heat trans-
fer but requires the use of a transparent window to achieve high
pressure, which is then a critical component since it must also oper-
ate at high-temperature [105]. In contrast, for an indirect irradiation
configuration, such as the one developed at ETH Zurich (Fig. 16), the
working fluid is heated by a porous structure that in turn is heated
by an opaque cavity-type absorber, eliminating the need of a win-
dow at the expense of having a less efficient heat transfer by conduc-
tion through the absorber walls.

PWhile the approach of indirectly hybridising a conventional
gas turbine (Fig. 13) is technically feasible, significant challenges
remain to be overcome before it is likely to be implemented

Fig. 13. Basic options for thermal hybridisation using sensible solar heat into a Bray-
ton cycle. This option has limited options for carbon-capture (and storage or re-use)
owing to the high level of dilution of the combustion air, but can use fuels that have
been thermo-chemically upgraded with solar energy.

PThat is, the cost penalty associated with intermittent use of CO2 cap-
ture technology can be avoided by sharing the infrastructure associ-
ated with capture CO2 with that employed for the solar thermal
process itself. This is possible with the hybrid solar thermal chemical
looping processes described below.

7.2. Different options for hybridising a Brayton cycle

PIn a Brayton cycle, as shown in Fig. 13, air at ambient conditions
is first drawn into a compressor to pressurise it to 5(cid:1)30 bar and
increases the temperature through the compression process [103].
For a conventional Brayton cycle, the pressurised and heated air is
then introduced to a combustion chamber where the fuel is burned
to further increase the temperature of the pressurised air. Finally,
the high pressure and temperature flue gas is passed through a gas
turbine, expanding to the atmospheric pressure and thus producing
power [103]. The operating temperature of the commercially avail-
able gas turbines is presently approximately 1250 °C [58] and is
anticipated to increase to 1700 °C in the foreseeable future [104].
The thermal efficiency of a simple Brayton cycle is typically higher
than that of a simple steam Rankine cycles due to its higher operat-
ing temperature. Similarly, a higher solar to electrical efficiency can
be achieved using hybrid Brayton cycles than for hybrid Rankine
cycles and could be applied to a wide range of power levels from 1
to 100 MWe [105]. A solar hybrid Brayton cycle can be also combined
with a “bottoming” Rankine cycle [7] or other processes that need
low to medium operating temperature such as desalination [106].

Pcoal combustion in a boiler when the added costs of CO2 capture
are accounted for. Given that this high cost results from the
much lower concentration of CO2 in the exhaust from a gas tur-
bine over a boiler, the penalty will be even greater for a hybrid,
since the combustion products are even more dilute.

PThe integration of the pressurized-air solar receiver into a gas
turbine cycle involves a trade-off. The power cycle efficiency
increases with the turbine inlet temperature, although the effi-
ciency of a solar receiver decreases at a higher average operating
temperature due to re-radiation losses. Up to a temperature of
700 °C, the air receiver based Brayton cycle would not always be
competitive vis-a-vis a steam receiver based Rankine cycle. The
main advantage of the air receiver becomes evident at tempera-
tures above 700 °C where the higher achievable efficiency pro-
vides a competitive advantage. The downside is that the high-
temperature air needs to be contained and transported to the
power generation unit using expensive piping made of nickel-
based alloys. Table 4 presents a summary of the advantages and
disadvantages of the various options presented above.

8. Hybrid solar chemical looping combustion

PNew concepts are emerging for technologies that hybridise CST
with chemical
looping combustion (CLC), termed Hybrid Solar
Chemical Looping Combustion (Hy-Sol-CLC). This concept is shown
schematically in Fig. 17.

Pwidely. For example, the solar share of the European REFOS proj-
ect, which employed an after-burner system, was measured to
be only 28.6% during periods where the solar resource is avail-
able [105]. This would reduce significantly if it is to be used
when the solar resource needs to be supplemented. Furthermore,
this configuration does not achieve CO2 capture and, while cap-
ture is technically possible from a gas turbine, it is also both
expensive and energy intensive with currently available technol-
ogy. Indeed Mathieu and Bolland [97] found that there is little
benefit in the use of natural gas combined cycle over pulverised

lated porous ceramic foam contained in a stainless steel pressure vessel, with a secondary concentrator (CPC) attached to its windowless aperture, adapted from previous work,
modified from [111].

Fig. 17. Schematic representation of a hybrid solar chemical looping combustion (Hy-Sol-CLC). Solar thermal energy can be stored in the oxygen carrier (OC) particles as both
chemical and sensible heat, which are reduced in the Solar Fuel Reactor and oxidised in the Air Reactor, while also achieving inherent capture of the CO2 emissions from the
combustion.

PStand-alone CLC technology is under development owing to its
potential to achieve efficient CO2 capture using Reduction-Oxidation
(redox) reactions, with low energy penalty [116]. In CLC a metal
oxide, referred to as oxygen carrier (OC), is employed to oxidise the
fuel in one reactor (the fuel reactor), thus avoiding direct contact
between the fuel and the nitrogen in the air while also reducing the
OC. The reduced OC is then oxidised in a second reactor (the air reac-
tor) using oxygen from air [42,43,117]. The reduction of MeaOb (as
oxygen carrier) to MegOh with CnH2m within the fuel reactor, and
the oxidation of MegOh to MeaOb with oxygen from air within the air
reactor are described as follows [118]:

PLoop seals are currently the leading method employed to miti-
gate gas leakage between the air and fuel reactors during the cycling
of the oxygen carriers between the reactors [42]. The oxygen carriers
are typically in the form of particles and comprise an active metal
oxide and an inert support. The inert support is typically used to
increase the mechanical strength and reactivity of the OC particles
in successive redox reactions [117].

PThe key driver for CLC technology is its strong potential to
achieve low cost CO2 capture. Indeed, it has been identified as a pre-
ferred approach from the four classes of carbon capture technologies
of CLC, pre-combustion capture, post-combustion capture and oxy-
fuel combustion [51,119,120]. Nevertheless, the use of a solid OC
limits the operating temperature of the CLC systems to typically
around 1000 °C to avoid softening, sintering or other damage to OC
in successive redox reactions [42,121(cid:1)123]. This is significantly
lower than both the temperature that can be achieved through
combustion of the fuels in conventional combustion systems and
the operating temperature of the state-of-the-art in commercially
available gas turbines, which is currently around 1250(cid:1)1300 °C
[104,124]. Hence, the use of CLC results in an exergy loss that
lowers the maximum thermodynamic efficiency of the CLC-based
power cycles relative to that which can be achieved with conven-
tional natural gas combined cycles (NGCC) [125,126]. In contrast,

Pthis temperature is higher than the state-of-the-art in commercial
solar thermal systems, which typically operate at temperatures of
»600 °C but are expected to reach temperatures of »1000 °C in the
near future [67]. That is, Hy-Sol-CLC can be classified as both solar-
positive and combustion-positive”, because the temperature range
of CLC is compatible with solar thermal technology and also does
not involve a compromise relative to the equivalent combustion
technology with carbon capture.

PAnother synergistic element between CST and CLC is the inherent
use of thermo-chemical storage in CLC systems [19,20]. More specifi-
cally, for those CLC systems in which the reduction reaction in the
fuel reactor, Eq. (4) is endothermic (noting that exothermic reduc-
tions are also possible for some combinations of fuel and the metal
oxide [118,127]), there is potential to supply the enthalpy of the OC
reduction reaction with CST. That is, there is potential to use the
same reactor to also provide chemical storage of solar energy [118].
Additional storage of solar thermal energy can be achieved using the
thermal mass of the OCs to provide sensible storage. This stored
energy can then be recovered from the oxidation of the reduced
oxygen carriers (within the air reactor), which always employs an
exothermic reaction (Eq. (5)) [118,127]. The stored energy can be
used to either increase the output from the CLC-based power plant
or decrease the specific fuel consumption [19,20]. Furthermore,
integration of storage vessels for the OC particles to manage their
circulation between the fuel and air reactors, as shown in Fig. 17,
enables both the long-term storage of solar thermal energy and
dispatchable/base-load power production [19,20]. That is, the two
reactors in a CLC system (Fig. 17) offer potential for shared infra-
structure in achieving thermochemical and sensible storage, and
hence reduced costs, through a hybrid system while also achieving
inherent carbon capture from the combustion component of the
energy source [19,20,118].

PThe hybridising of CST with CLC technology offers potential to
increase the exergetic efficiency relative to a solar-only process. This
is because the use of a fuel as reducing agent within the fuel reactor
enables the stored heat to be released at a higher temperature than
the solar receiver through oxidation reaction within the air reactor
[21,118]. This stands in stark contrast to all other thermal energy
storage systems previously proposed to our knowledge, for which
the storage process results in a significant reduction in temperature,
and hence in exergetic efficiency [128,129]. The slight exception to
this is the closely related thermochemical energy storage system
proposed by Haseli et al. [90] and Jafarian et al. [93] for which
changes to the partial pressure of oxygen in the gas phase is
employed as the driving force for the reduction and oxidation of the

Pmetal oxide. Nevertheless, these processes are estimated to achieve
a similar temperature for storage and release of solar thermal
energy, while the Hy-Sol-CLC achieves a temperature increase in the
oxidation reactor. It is also worth reiterating that, for a conventional
solar-only plant, exergy losses are incurred both in the transfer of
heat from the receiver to the storage vessel and in the subsequent
transfer to the working fluid [67,128].

PIn summary, the potential advantages of Hy-Sol-CLC concept are

as follows [18(cid:1)20,130]:

P(cid:3) an increase in exergetic efficiency over a solar-only equivalent
by adding the enthalpy from the fuel downstream from the solar
receiver;

P(cid:3) inherent CO2 capture which, to our knowledge, is one of the few
solar-combustion hybrid technologies that achieves carbon cap-
ture;

P(cid:3) similar exergetic efficiency relative to the equivalent non-solar

CLC technology with CO2 capture;

P(cid:3) the sharing of infrastructure, in that the thermal storage system
is also utilised for the CO2 capture. This offers potential to lower
cost over the stand-alone counterparts;

P(cid:3) firm supply through potential to revert to conventional CLC
operation in the event of extended periods of low solar radiation
[20];

P(cid:3) high energy density of the thermal storage relative to present
sensible energy storage systems due to the use of both thermo-
chemical and sensible energy [17].

PTable 5 summarises the Hy-Sol-CLC systems that have been
proposed to date. As can be seen, solar hybridization of CLC with
CST was first proposed by Hong and Jin [18]. This Hy-Sol-CLC gas
turbine cycle proposes to employ the concentrated solar radia-
tion to provide heat to reduce NiO with CH4 at a temperature of
530 °C, within the reduction reactor. This process advantageously
converts the CST to chemical energy at a temperature of 530 °C,
which is achievable with commercially available solar thermal
technology. The stored heat is then released within the air reac-
tor at a temperature of 1200 °C. However, this cycle does not
provide any energy storage and is estimated to offer an instanta-
neous solar share of only 10(cid:1)16%, during periods when the solar
resource is available. Furthermore, the use of the pure NiO par-
ticles for the OC at temperatures of more than 1000 °C, as was
proposed both for the cycles of Hong et al.’s [18,130] and of
Jafarian et al.’s first cycle [19], is not realistic with present tech-
nology. When subjected to repeated reduction/oxidation at these
conditions, both agglomeration and deactivation were observed
[43]. Pure NiO particles also have a low reaction rate due to their
low porosity [131,132].

PMore recently, Jafarian et al. [20] proposed a Hy-Sol-CLC gas
turbine combined cycle (GTCC), in which the operating tempera-
ture of the solar fuel reactor is maintained constant by varying the
flow rates of fuel and OC particles in response to the variations in
the input of CST. The configuration of this Hy-Sol-CLC GTCC is
shown in Fig. 18. The cycle comprises two main sections: (i) a hot
gas generator and (ii) a combined cycle power generation plant.
Concentrated solar thermal radiation from the solar collector field
is proposed to be captured and stored within the solar fuel reactor
of the hybrid-CLC section by the OC particles. The stored heat is
then released in the air reactor at a higher temperature to produce
a steady stream of hot gas. Two reservoirs are also proposed to
store the OC particles. This provides a means with which to control
the flow rate of OC particles to the air reactor despite variation in
the solar energy input. A direct air-particle heat exchanger is also
proposed to be added to the process between the air reactor and
reservoir R1 both to lower the temperature of the stored OC par-
ticles in reservoir R2, which increases their thermal mass without

Preducing the oxidation reaction rate in the air reactor, and to pre-
heat the input air to the air reactor. An after-burner was also pro-
posed as an option with which to further heat the hot and
pressurised outlet stream from the air reactor before its introduc-
tion to the gas turbine. However, this option requires additional
fuel, so that the increase in power cycle efficiency comes at the
trade-off of releasing some uncaptured CO2 and lowering the solar
share. Table 5 also shows that the estimated solar share of this
Hy-Sol-CLC GTCC for the cases with and without the supplemen-
tary heating from the after-burner, is 41% and 60%, respectively,
while the corresponding first law efficiencies are 44% and 35.4%.
This efficiency includes the energy needed to capture and com-
press the CO2 ready for reuse or storage. It can also be seen that
the after-burner offers a trade-off between cycle efficiency and
CO2 capture.

8.1. Critical research challenges for the Hy-Sol-CLC

PNotwithstanding the potential advantages of hybrids between
CST and CLC, they are at a relatively early stage of development.
Hence further research, development and demonstration is required
if they are to be implemented. In particular, there is a critical need to
develop further improved OC materials that are robust to a very
large number of cycles without significant degradation. There is also
a need to develop, or adapt, reduction reactors that convert the con-
centrated solar radiation to sensible and chemical energy with high
efficiency at the desired temperature, since these hybrid cycles
are yet to be demonstrated. Finally, further research in alternative
power cycles is warranted to identify alternative reactions and/or
configurations with even further potential than those proposed to
date.

PThe vulnerability of the particles to breakage leads to serious
challenges both in their efficient circulation between the reactors
and in the application of the CLC to gas turbine combined cycles
(GTCC), which are vulnerable to fine particles. Hence, arguably
the biggest challenge to their commercial implementation is the
need to develop OC materials that satisfy the multiple criteria of
high oxidative capacity together with both physical stability and
good kinetics over large number of redox reactions. This, in turn,
implies the need for a large active surface area, such as can be
obtained with high porosity. For the cases where the OC is to be
circulated between interconnected fluidised beds, the require-
ment for mechanical robustness is even greater, while suitability
for fluidisation is also required.
In addition, the OC material
employed in Hy-Sol-CLC need to react endothermically with the
fuel (Eq. (4)), which imposes further restrictions on the material
selection [118].

PWhile no solar fuel reactor has been developed specifically for
Hy-Sol-CLC process, there is potential to draw on those reactors that
have been developed to heat particles for other processes, employ-
ing both direct and indirect in different processes [136(cid:1)138]. This
work has shown that it is desirable to employ direct heat transfer
systems if possible, since these offer the potential advantages of
high heat transfer and low exergy loss [137]. However, for the reac-
tors proposed to date, this comes at the expense of relying on a win-
dowed reactor, which have thus far proven to be vulnerable to
particle deposition, thermal shock, high pressure and the need for
effective sealing [87,136,139,140]. On the other hand, indirect heat-
ing systems offer more robust configurations at the expense of lower
rates of heat transfer [3,138]. A suitable reactor for Hy-Sol-CLC will
also need to avoid excessive radiative heating rates of the OC par-
ticles to avoid overheating and deactivation from melting, sintering
or carbon deposition [141]. Hence the challenge of developing
solar fuel reactors for the Hy-Sol-CLC process can benefit from, or
contribute to, that of reactors for a number of similar solar chemical
processes.

Fig. 18. A schematic diagram of hybrid solar-CLC combined cycle, modified from [134]. Reservoirs R1 and R2 are used to store the hot and cold particles, respectively. A direct air-
particle heat exchager is proposed to also incoprorate sensible thermal storage. The hot and pressurised stream from the air reactor is used to generate power by means of a
three-stage gas turbine. Additional heat is recovered with the heat recovery steam generators (AR-HRSG and FR-HRSG). An after-burner can optionally be used to increase the
temperature to the gas turbine inlet using valves V2 and V3.

9. Comparison of technology options and scientific challenges

PThe overall potential of the various alternative types of hybrid
technology that have been proposed to date is summarised in Table 6
and discussed in turn below

P(cid:3) Solar feedwater preheating: This technology has limited poten-
tial as a stand-alone technology, primarily because of its rela-
tively low solar share of below 2% on an annually averaged basis
reported to date, although this could be increased with the use
of thermal storage. In addition TES is yet to be demonstrated
with SAPG, to our knowledge. Furthermore, the potential for
retro-fit of this technology to existing (mostly coal-fired) boilers
is limited by the relatively few sites with sufficient solar
resource, available land on which to accommodate a solar helio-
stat field and/or by the constraints of the existing turbine [66].
Hence the main potential of this option is likely to be either
to augment the carbon-mitigation potential of a future plant
designed with carbon capture or to augment a Hybrid-Solar
Receiver Combustor. This latter option offers potential to offer
power boosting and/or increased flexibility with the use of
lower cost solar concentrators.

P(cid:3) Direct integration of solar receiver and combustor: Strong
potential
is anticipated for the direct integration of solar
receivers and combustors, pending its demonstration at suffi-
cient scale. This technology has potential to be compatible both
with existing CSP technology and TES, offering firm supply at a
greater efficiency than from a stand-alone combustion back-up.

PThe technology also has potential to be made compatible with
carbon capture during the combustion-only mode, and can also
be used with low carbon fuels such as natural gas or syngas
derived from biomass. However, since it is limited to cavity
receivers, it is most likely to be applicable mostly to relatively
high temperatures where cavities are desirable, such as greater
than about 500 °C.

PThe challenges associated with the further development of this tech-
nology are:

Pa. Quantifying the impact of the different design and operating
parameters on performance (i.e. efficiency and emissions) as a
function of scale for all three modes, namely: solar only, com-
bustion only and the mixed mode;

Pb. Developing effective strategies to mitigate convective losses
through the aperture (e.g. with an aerodynamic curtain) to
increase efficiency in the mixed mode;

Pc. Investigating burner designs that allow fuel flexibility and the

use of alternative fuels;

Pd. Deeper understanding of the effect of concentrated solar radia-
tion on the structure of, and emission from, turbulent flames in
the HSRC;

Pe. Investigating the feasibility of utilizing the HSRC technology for

combined heat and power.

Pthe temperature of air from a pressurised solar air heater, this
approach appears to have relatively limited potential without a
break-through. This is, in part, because the costs of TES are sig-
nificantly increased by the need to store pressurised air and, in
part, because gas turbines are poorly suited to carbon capture
owing to the low concentration of CO2 in the exhaust from a gas
turbine. Furthermore, without storage, a relatively low solar
share is anticipated. Hence, without a breakthrough, other
options are likely to be more attractive.

isation of CST with Chemical Looping Combustion (Hy-Sol-CLC)
has significant potential to make a contribution to a low-carbon
energy sources on the proviso that the technical challenges asso-
ciated with chemical looping (or redox) technology can be over-
come. The value proposition for this hybrid relative to NGCC
with carbon capture is the potential to achieve both a lower fuel
consumption (and hence running costs) and a lower production
of captured CO2 for sequestration or re-use, relative to NGCC
with carbon capture, which will also lower running costs. The
development of new materials for the oxygen carrier offers
potential to further increase this potential. A state-of-the-art
NGCC with carbon capture has an efficiency of around 50% and
produces approximately 0.395 kg CO2/kWh [97], while a Hy-Sol-
CLC GTCC (without an after burner) is estimated to achieve an
efficiency of approximately 44% and to produce approximately
0.18 kg CO2/kWh, which is around 45% of the CO2 produced in
NGCC with carbon capture [134]. Furthermore, relative to the
equivalent solar-only technology, the Hy-Sol-CLC offers an
increased exergetic efficiency because the fuel increases the
temperature of the outlet gas relative to the solar reactor, which
reduces radiation losses. It also offers a high solar share and
capacity for firm supply. Nevertheless, to achieve this potential,
significant technology development is required both for the
solar receivers and for the oxygen carrier to enable the process
to operate for many cycles of oxidation and reduction without
significant degradation or attrition.

P(cid:3) Hybridising through low carbon oxidants and fuels: The
potential to introduce solar oxygen into a combustion plant for
oxy-fuel combustion technology can avoid approximately a
decrease in the net efficiency of a power cycle by approximately
ten percentage points, caused by the energy consumed in air
separation units [142,143]. The potential use of solar syngas via
solar gasification of solid carbonaceous feedstocks or solar steam
reforming of natural gas in a Rankine cycle can reduce the net
carbon intensity of the process due by increasing the heating
value of the feedstock with CST by »40% (or 23% for natural gas)
[87,88,147]. Alternatively, the solar syngas can be utilised in a
more efficient gas-turbine combined cycle.

10. Summary and conclusions

PHybrids are expected to play an increasingly important role in
future power generation, both for centralised power plant and for
combined heat and power. This is because combustion can play as
an important complement to thermal energy storage in being able to
accommodate both seasonal (i.e. long term) and weather-based (i.e.
short term) variability in the solar resource. Hybridising combustion
with CST upstream from the turbine offers the potential to avoid (or
reduce) the need to turn-down the turbine, with the associated loss
in efficiency. In the short-term, hybrids offer potential to reduce the
amount of fossil fuel needed to provide firm supply, while in the lon-
ger term they offer potential to lower the cost of carbon-neutral
cycles over their stand-alone counterparts.

PWhile some hybrids systems are already commercially available,
these are limited to “indirect” systems, which combine within one
operation.

PNevertheless, even these existing systems demonstrate the potential
to achieve firm supply with both a higher solar share and lower net
CO2 emissions than their stand-alone counterparts. They also offer
potential to lower capital cost through the sharing of infrastructure
and to increase efficiency through reduced heat losses arising from
the use of fewer components, through improved cycle efficiency and
reduced turn-down, and through reduced start-up and shut-down
losses. The potential benefits of hybridisation are potentially even
greater with “direct hybrids”, which integrate the solar receiver and
the combustor, the turbine, the cooling system, the thermal storage
systems and/or the CO2 capture system.

PThe two classes of CST-hybrids that are commercially available
today are the use of CST to preheat the feedwater to a regenerative
Rankine cycle, termed Solar Aided Power Generation, and the use of
back-up boiler in a solar thermal Rankine cycle plant. The SAPG sys-
tem is solar positive, in that it offers improved performance over a
solar-only option because it displaces steam that is withdrawn at a
higher temperature than the solar receiver. However, it has a rela-
tively low annual solar share of 3(cid:1)15% and can be applied only to a
limited number of sites for a retrofit. Nevertheless, SAPG also has
potential to be used upgrade other solar plants employing a regener-
ative Rankine cycle, although this is yet to be implemented to our
knowledge. A conventional solar hybrid provides increased plant
efficiency by reducing turn-down compared with a stand-alone solar
plant, together with infrastructure sharing of the turbine and cooling
cycle.

PAn emerging technology that is applicable (but not limited) to
the Rankine cycle, is the hybrid solar receiver-combustor. This is
a direct hybrid that has been estimated to offer up to 17% reduc-
tion in LCOE, together with a reduction in net fuel consumption
by up to 40%, relative to an equivalent hybrid from stand-alone
components through reduced capital cost and further reduced
start-up and shut-down losses. This option is both solar-positive
and combustion-positive for the case where the reference com-
bustion process is an equivalent boiler, although it is combustion
negative when compared with a gas-turbine combined cycle. The
hybrids are also compatible with post-combustion carbon cap-
ture, although the economics of these options are yet to be eval-
uated to the best of our knowledge. Furthermore, while none of
these options offer integrated CO2 capture, they appear to be
well suited to combined heat and power applications.

PThe hybrid between chemical looping combustion technology
and solar thermal (Hy-Sol-CLC) has potential to be both solar posi-
tive and combustion positive for the case of hybrids with integrated
CO2 capture, although the technical feasibility is yet to be demon-
strated. Its potential advantages, relative to both combustion-based
peaking plant and to baseload combustion technologies with CO2
capture, are as follows:

P(cid:3) Similar efficiency to combustion process with CO2 capture:
The turbine inlet temperature for a Hy-Sol-CLC process is similar
to that of the CLC process, so that the base-load efficiency is the
same. However, hybridising before the turbine avoids the need
to turn down the turbine in response to the solar load, so that
part-load operation is greater.

P(cid:3) Integrated thermal energy storage: this concept offers the
potential for relatively low cost thermal energy storage because
the same reactors required for the chemical looping process can
be used to provide chemical (and sensible) storage of solar
energy.

P(cid:3) Greater efficiency than the equivalent solar-only process:
Because the solar energy is added to the reduction reactor, the
temperature of the receiver is lower than the turbine inlet tem-
perature. For this reason, the radiation losses from the receiver
(which scale with the fourth power of the temperature differ-
ence between the receiver and ambient) are lower than for the

Pequivalent solar-only process. In addition, this process avoids
the exergy losses of solar energy storage that are inherent in
conventional solar only processes that follow from the tempera-
ture of the turbine being lower than that of the receiver;

PFinally, while the potential benefits of hybridising concentrating
solar thermal energy with combustion are significant,
further
research and technology development is required to harness their
full potential. Critical among these research needs, which the pres-
ent review aims to stimulate, are the following:

P(cid:3) New approaches and understanding are needed to mitigate
losses from direct hybrids between CST and combustion, such as
the mitigation of convective losses through the aperture for the
hybrid solar receiver combustor during the mixed mode of oper-
ation.

P(cid:3) Development of a robust approach and understanding with
looping combustion, such as

which to implement chemical
through use of robust oxygen carriers;

P(cid:3) Development of a reliable hybrid fuel reactor to enable the
implementation of the reduction of the oxygen carrier with con-
centrated solar radiation.

P(cid:3) Development of alterative configurations of direct hybrids
between concentrating solar thermal energy and combustion,
such as those that can be suited for the heating of particles.

P(cid:3) Further identification of novel hybrid cycles and/or materials
involving chemical looping, together with integration into low
carbon cycles such as oxy-fuel combustion.
