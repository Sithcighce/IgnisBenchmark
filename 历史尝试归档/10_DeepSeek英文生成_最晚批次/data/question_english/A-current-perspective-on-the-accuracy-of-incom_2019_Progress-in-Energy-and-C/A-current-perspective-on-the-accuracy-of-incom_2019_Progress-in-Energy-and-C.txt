The state-of-the-art in the accuracy of solar resources forecasting is obtained by using results reported
in 1705 accuracy tests reported in several geographic regions (North America, Europe, Asia, Australia).
There is a tendency in literature to avoid reporting model performance assessments in places, or on time-
horizons, where it is known that the models have low performance. Usual bias and spreading statistical
indicators are useful tools but taking proper decision by managers of funding agencies and policy makers
requires usage of additional error measures. Several classes of forecasting models have been compared:
persistence, classical statistics, machine learning, cloud-motion tracking, numerical weather prediction
and hybrid models (combining classical statistics with machine learning approach and/or exogenous in-
puts). Forecasting errors increase by increasing the time-horizon. Forecasting model performance depends
on time-horizon and climate. Machine learning and hybrid models have the best performance for intra-
hour performance in all climates. The best intra-hour forecasts are provided in all climates by machine
learning and classical statistics models while the hybrid models perform well in tropical and snow cli-
mates. For day-ahead forecasts the hybrid models have very good performance in all climates. Generally,
the hybrid models have the best performance. The accuracy of the forecasting models significantly in-
creased in the last decade. The normalized MBE and RMSE have been reduced by two thirds and one
third, respectively.

1. Introduction

Fossil fuels have been used from ancient times. This is under-
standable by the conjunction of three facts: (1) fossil fuels are easy
to exploit, (2) some primary sources (coal) can be used in practice
as they are, and (3) increasing the volumetric density of energy
(e.g. oil refinement) can be obtained by relatively simple technolo-
gies. Currently, fossil fuels still supply over 80% of the world’s en-
ergy consumption. According to the IEA statistics a slowly decreas-
ing trend in the world total primary energy supply by fossil fuels
is noted, from about 86% in 1973 to 81% in 2016 [1] .

Events like the oil crisis in 1973, the Chernobyl catastrophic nu-
clear accident in 1986 and especially the awareness of the ever-
increasing degradation of the environment have led to global sus-
tainable development policies. Starting with the Kyoto Protocol, the
world entered in a new developing stage with new targets cov-
ering sustainable living supported by renewable energies. Within
this stage, the climate change represents a major challenge, global
communities trying to find different energy saving strategies along
with the increasing use of renewable energy. Irrefutably, the mix of
the energy systems will play a significant role in designing a sus-
tainable society [2] . Currently there are many concerns regarding
energy sources and consumption patterns, including: (1) the grow-
ing needs of a rising worldwide population that makes effort s f or
better living standards and (2) the strong evidence that continuing
use of fossil fuels without actions to reduce the greenhouse gas
emissions may lead to irreversible environmental damage. With re-
gards to these concerns, Ref. [3] concludes that conservation is of
the highest priority. While targeting significantly better conversion
and end-use efficiencies, conservation preserves energy resources
and reduces the environmental impact. It is generally accepted that
in the future solar energy will have a substantial contribution in
the conservation of the energy resources concurrently with meet-
ing the global energy demand.

On  the  other  hand,  closely  related  to  our  high-tech  lifestyle,
among our energy options electricity has won a privileged place.
Even if some primary sources can be used directly in thermal or
mechanical applications, the preoccupation to get electricity from
them remains at forefront, both for research and industry. In this
context, no wonder that the weight of solar electricity in the en-
ergy mix experienced an impressive augment and this trend is ex-
pected to continue. The total installed solar power capacity in the
world has multiplied in ten years by 46 times, from 6.6 GWp in
200 6  to  30 6.5  GWp  by  the  end  of  2016  [4] .  The  global  market
was by far dominated by China with 34.5 GWp connected to the
grid in 2016, which means an advance of 128% over the capacity
installed in 2015. Solar power in the EU continued its downward
trend in 2016, adding 6.7 GWp, a 21% decrease compared to the

8.6 GWp installed in 2015. Sometimes, aided by favorable policies,
reality exceeds the most optimistic predictions. A good example is
the amazing growth of the solar power capacity installed in Ro-
mania, where at the end of 2011 the installed capacity was less
than 2 MWp, while the Governmental PV Systems Strategy has a
target of 260 MWp by 2020 [5] . Remarkably, in May 2014 the in-
stalled PV capacity in Romania has exceeded 1.1 GWp (According to
Ref. [6] , quoting the Romanian Transmission and System Operator
- Transelectrica). However, after this success story, the PV sector
in Romania experienced a decline in state subsidy, the growth rate
decreased and currently, June 2018, the total installed PV capacity
in Romania is 1.37 GWp. It is worth noting that in addition to the
grid-connected applications, there is enough room for using solar
energy in many other off-grid domestic and industrial applications.
For example, solar electricity may have a notable potential of use
in the global petroleum sector, ranging from 6 to 11 GW in ex-
traction and transport operations and 17 to 91 GW in refining [7] .
Solar-thermal conversion is another facet of domestic solar energy
use. An outstanding review on exergy analysis of solar-thermal col-
lectors and processes is presented in [8] .

However, a challenge standing against the growth of the share
of solar electricity in the energy mix stems from the stochastic na-
ture of solar energy. Unlike the power generated by the traditional
power plants based on fossil or nuclear fuels, the output power of
the wind and photovoltaic plants is highly variable to erratic. This
variability is quantified in [9] based on measured time series in the
year 2014. Data were collected from the EU transmission system
operators. Solar thermal systems react to solar irradiance changes
in  minutes  or  more  while  the  PV  systems  react  in  milliseconds.
The thermal inertia smooths the output power of the solar-thermal
plants. Even so, due to the potential to provide cost-effective CO
2
mitigation  and  firm  supply,  the  development  of  technologies  for
hybridizing  concentrating  solar-thermal  and  combustion  are  cur-
rently considered [10] . In order to reduce the effective-costs of in-
tegrating  the  PV  plants  into  the  existing  power  grid,  forecasting
the energy production of the PV plants is a key issue. High-quality
forecasting will enable grid operators to schedule non-renewable
traditional capacities (e.g. gas power plants) to compensate for the
PV power output variation.

Inherently,  forecasting  the  output  power  of  a  solar  plant  in-
volves  two  interrelated  issues  [11] :  (1)  forecasting  the  solar  re-
source and (2) realistic modeling of the photovoltaic converter re-
sponse. Certainly, the accuracy of forecasting the energy produc-
tion of a PV plant is mainly conditioned by the accuracy of fore-
casting the solar resources. This motivates the focus of this study
on reviewing the methods of solar resources forecasting.

This introductory section continues by outlining and motivating
the objectives of this study, followed by a brief overview of so-

lar radiation variability and ends with a description from a broad
perspective of the solar resources forecasting models. The specific
radiometric quantities referred in this study are briefly defined in
Appendix A .

1.1. Objectives and motivation

The number of papers published on the topic of forecasting so-
lar resource has been growing at an exponential rate throughout
the  last  decade,  as  Fig.  1  shows.  Generally,  the  studies  are  site-
specific, the results strongly depending on the model nature, the
time horizon of the forecast and the local climate, along with a
large number of  other  characteristics  pertaining to  the  data and
models. This is a major limitation, which makes the generalization
of  the  results  difficult. What  is  needed  is  to  test  a  given  model
over all different mentioned factors, so that their effect can be av-
eraged out. Furthermore, in order to draw clear conclusions about
the performance of a given forecasting model, applied in a particu-
lar scenario (time horizon, local climate, etc.), it would be ideal to
test the model independently in as many locations as possible pre-
serving the scenario. These views apply to our study too, where the
investigated dataset consists of a sample of statistical indicators of
solar irradiance forecasting accuracy. The dataset, built with statis-
tical indicators reported by different studies (see Section 2.4 ), must
be large enough so that it can be assumed statistically significant.
In other words, the conclusions of this study disclose a global pic-
ture about the current performance of solar irradiance forecasting
models and its trend. Fig. 1 shows that such an analysis as we pro-
pose here could never have been performed a few (4-5) years ago,
simply because of the lack of published papers. Even though sev-
eral of the previously published review papers warn about paying
attention to influential factors when comparing results from differ-
ent publications [12,13] , none has actually performed such a study.
This study presents an in-depth analysis of the performance of
solar irradiance forecasting models aiming to chart out the exist-
ing gaps in the scientific literature. A large number of papers pub-
lished between 2006–2017 were analyzed. The studied dataset was
collected from forty papers selected on the following criteria: the

time, June 3, 2016. The graphs are built by using data recorded at high frequency of

accuracy of the results reported by the selected papers are pre-
sented  in  terms  of  normalized  root  mean  square  error  ( nRMSE )
and normalized mean bias error ( nMBE ) (see Section 2.1 for def-
initions). This allows comparing samples of different sizes includ-
ing data of different magnitudes, thus ensuring a common basis
for inter-comparison analyses. The selection according to this cri-
terion leads to an arbitrary sampling, and thus this review gener-
ates a reliable picture of the state-of-the-art in the accuracy of so-
lar resources forecasting. A number of 1705 tests reported by the
selected  papers  in  terms  of  nRMSE  and  nMBE  were  analyzed.  In
other words, the dataset analyzed in this paper contains a num-
ber of 1705 entries, each entry consisting of a pair of nRMSE and
nMBE along with stamps for the class of the tested model, climate
zone of the location from where the testing data were collected,
recording  period  and  forecasting  horizon.  The  analysis  was  per-
formed from four perspectives: classes of forecasting models (clas-
sical statistics CS, machine learning ML, cloud motion tracking CM,
numerical weather prediction models NW and hybrid models HY),
time-horizon (intra-hour, intra-day and day ahead), climate (tropi-
cal, arid, temperate and snow) and performance trend over time.

1.2. Solar resource variability in brief

Fig. 2 illustrates the variation of global solar irradiance at dif-
ferent time scales. There are two major causes of the global solar
irradiance variability:

(1) The apparent movement of the Sun on the sky. The solar ir-
radiance varies continuously  at different time scales along
the  year,  during  the  seasons  and  throughout  the  day  (see
the nice bell shape in day 7 from Fig. 2 a) and drops to zero
at night. This is a deterministic component in solar irradi-
ance variability, which is accurately accounted by the clear-
sky models [14] .

122

(2) Passing  clouds  on  the  sky.  The  solar  irradiance  fluctuates,
many times in an erratic way ( Fig. 2 b, c). On smaller time
scale,  the  predominant  concern  is  the  variability  induced
by the wandering clouds. Fast variation of solar irradiance,
called  solar  ramp ,  is  an  extreme  obstacle  in  operating  the
power grid. The motion of a cloud shadow across a small
PV capacity can cause the output power to fall down to al-
most zero and then back to full capacity over the span of
a few seconds. Indeed, the change in solar irradiance at a
point due to a passing cloud can exceed 60% of the peak of
solar irradiance in seconds [15] . The time it takes for a pass-
ing cloud to shade an entire PV plant depends on various
factors, namely the PV plant size and cloud speed. As exam-
ple, in case of a 13.2 MWp PV plant in Nevada, an 80% ramp
measured by a pyranometer in 60 seconds is associated with
50% ramp in the power output measured in the same time
[15] . It was shown that the geographical distribution of PV
plants connected to the same grid has a smoothing effect on
the aggregate amount of fluctuations [16] .

Quantification of the solar irradiance variability is a hot topic in
solar  energy  research field  [17,18] . Different proposed  quantifiers
capture different facets of the variability in solar irradiance series
and currently there is no general consensus on which particular
quantifier is the most suitable for classifying different intervals of
time according to the variability of the solar radiative regime.

To conclude, the solar irradiance may fluctuate with high am-
plitude at different time scale. Thus, the development of tools for
both  nowcasting  and  forecasting  solar  irradiance  is  a  timely  re-
search  area  for  safely  operating  the  power  grid  partially  fed  by
solar plants. The next section introduces the main classes of the
existing solar irradiance forecasting models.

1.3. Classes of forecasting models

In this section, different models for forecasting solar radiation
are  briefly  discussed  from  a  formal  perspective.  The  models  are
stratified into six classes depending on their nature: classical sta-
tistical models (CS), models based on machine learning techniques
(ML),  cloud  motion  tracking  models  based  on  either  ground  or
satellite data (CM), numerical weather prediction models (NW) and
hybrid  models  (HY).  The  sixth  class  comprises  various  types  of
persistence models (PS), which commonly provide the benchmark
forecasts against which the performance of other models is tested.
For each class, a taxonomy tree diagram is presented (see [19] for
an introduction in taxonomy). It is worth to note that such taxon-
omy diagrams are not unique (different authors may classify differ-
ent models differently). An illustration of each class is performed
in Section 2.3 where the papers included in this study are inven-
toried.

In the following u denotes a generic variable, which can be as-

sociated with any radiometric quantity.

1.3.1. Persistence

The persistence method is the simplest way to produce a fore-
cast. It assumes that the state of a system at time index t − 1,
given by the observation u t- 1, will not change in the future. Thus,
the forecast generated at the time t − 1 for the next time t is:

1.3.2. Classical statistical models

Time series forecasting is a popular technique in many domains
such as economics [20] , sociology [21] , engineering [22] and so on.
In solar energy field, the classical statistical analysis of time series
is applied to generate forecasts at short-time scale, usually intra-
hour, but sometimes even up to three hours ahead [23] . Time se-
ries models make use of the high autocorrelation for short lags in
time series of solar irradiance and provide solar irradiance fore-
casts using only past measured values of solar irradiance as input.
From the multitude of the methods that have been tested and eval-
uated in this class, Markov processes, ARMA and ARIMA modeling
seem to be the main competitors.

A Markov process (see e.g. [24] ) is a stochastic process where
the present state encapsulates the process history, but also con-
tains information about its evolution in the future. Both defined by
the present state of the system, future and past are however inde-
pendent; the Markov process being a memoryless process. Future
states are reached through a probabilistic process instead of a de-
terministic one. Currently, various radiometric quantities are being
modeled on basis of the Markov processes [25] .

The acronym ARMA refers to an auto-regressive moving aver-
age model, a combination of autoregressive (AR) and moving aver-
age (MA) models [26] . These models are fitted to time series data
either aiming to better understand the data or to predict future
points in the series. ARMA provide a parsimonious description of
a stationary stochastic process in terms of two polynomials. The
general equation of an auto-regressive moving average model, de-
noted ARMA( p, q ), evaluates the variable u at the discrete time t as
a function of its values at previous time moments (see [26] for a
detailed presentation):

from [27] ).

In case of solar energy forecasting, the stationarity of the so-
lar irradiance series is ensured by removing the deterministic com-
ponent. This is generally obtained by dividing the measured value
of the solar irradiance at ground G to the corresponding quantity
evaluated at the top of the atmosphere G ext :
k t = G/ G ext

(3)

Eq. (3) defines the clearness index [28] , which isolates the stochas-
tic component of the solar irradiance time series. In general, the
clearness index is the radiometric quantity forecasted by the ARMA
models. The readers are encouraged to consult Refs. [29–31] for ap-
plications of the ARMA models in solar energy field.

The  acronym  ARIMA  refers  to  an  auto-regressive  integrated
moving  average  model.  ARIMA  models  can  be  applied  to  non-
stationary data. In this case, an initial differencing step should be
applied to remove the non-stationarity. This step corresponds to
the integrated part (I) of the model. A typical ARIMA( p,d,q ) model
is expressed by Eq. (2) where the variable u t is replaced by a new
variable w t obtained by differencing u t of d times:
w t = ( 1 − B ) d

models in terms of taxonomy diagram.

In the field of solar energy, the extent to which a model im-
proves the forecasting accuracy over the persistence is frequently
used to quantify the model quality. For this reason, in this study
the persistence-based models are treated as a separate class.

1.3.3. Machine learning

Machine  learning,  as  part  of  the  artificial  intelligence  theory,
studies the algorithms that can learn from and make predictions

on data. Different from traditional statistics, machine learning algo-
rithms are highly successful in dealing with incomplete and/or un-
certain data sets. Machine learning algorithms seem to be capable
to solve problems where the existing dependencies are non-linear
relationships between inputs and outputs or insufficiently known
to be programmed in a traditional, rigid manner. These qualities of
the machine learning theory are highly significant in the field of
weather and solar energy modeling and forecasting [32] as well as
in many other fields (e.g. medical field [33] ).

There  are  several  approaches  developed  under  the  machine
learning  theory  such  as:  Artificial  Neural  Networks  (ANN),  Ge-
netic  Algorithms  (GA),  Expert  Systems  (ES),  Support  Vector  Ma-
chine (SVM), Gaussian Process (GP), Decision trees (DT), Extreme
Learning Machine (ELM) and some hybrid systems that combine
the  above  algorithms  (see  the  taxonomy  diagram  from  Fig.  B2 ,
Appendix B ). Each of these approaches comes with advantages and
disadvantages. For example, ELM is quoted as learning faster than
other conventional algorithms [34] . The most popular method used
in solar energy forecasting is ANN, and this is the reason why it is
briefly described below.

The key element of any ANN is an artificial representation of
the biological neuron, as Fig 3 a illustrates schematically. The com-
putational implementation of an artificial neuron resides in an al-
gorithm in four steps [11] : (1) The inputs are multiplied by a pre-
determined weight and summed-up; (2) A bias is added to the re-
sult; (3) The sum is subjected to the activation (or transfer) func-
tion and is modulated accordingly; (4) The signal flows to the next
neuron. The bias input is an offset value that regulates the signal.
The common activation functions are logistic and Gaussian, respec-
tively, but, in principle, they may take any form. Mathematically,
the output u of an artificial neuron may be written as:

(cid:4)

(cid:6)

(cid:5)

u = f

(5)

ANN is a collective set of such neural units, in which the in-
dividual  neurons  are  connected  through  complex  synaptic  joints
characterized  by  weight  coefficients  and  every  single  neuron
makes its contribution towards the computational properties of the
whole  system.  In  solar  energy applications, a  typical  ANN  has  a
three layers feed-forward topology: input, hidden and output lay-
ers.  An  example  of  such  a  network,  the  Multi-Layer  Perceptron
(MLP) is given in Fig. 3 b. An ANN is not a priori programmed to
perform specific tasks, but instead it is trained using a backpropa-
gation procedure until patterns in input data are learned. The ANN
is typically initialized with random weights on its synapses, then
being trained in four steps: (1) forward propagation of the training
pattern input, (2) calculating the error function by comparing the
output with the target value; (3) backpropagation of the error in
order to generate the change in each weight (cid:6)w
ij  for all neurons

+ λ(cid:6)w

= w old

ij using a rule like w new

from the output and hidden layers and (4) updating the weights
i j , where λ is a learning pa-
w
rameter. As the training proceeds, the network’s response to the
input data becomes better and better. Once the network is trained,
all the synaptic weights are frozen (i.e. only the step (1), forward
propagation, remains enabled) and the network is ready to use. As
far as the number of hidden layers is concerned, two layers are
sufficient for almost any application since one layer can approx-
imate any kind of function. The number of hidden neurons in a
layer is established empirically between one and the number of
input variables.

Definitely  the  artificial  intelligence  techniques  have  gained
more and more ground in renewable energy modeling. The follow-
ing works outline a picture of the breadth and diversity of the ap-
plication of the technique. The book by Kalogirou [35] includes a
comprehensive review of the artificial intelligence techniques re-
lated to the renewable energy field, Ref. [36] reviews the artificial
intelligence methods in modeling the hydrogen production while
Ref. [37] reviews the artificial intelligence methods related to fore-
casting solar radiation data.

1.3.4. Cloud motion tracking

The  most  important  and  at  the  same  time  the  most  variable
attenuating factor for solar radiation at ground level is the cloud
cover.  Models  from  this  class  forecast  cloud  cover  from  full-sky
images  obtained  from  either  ground-based  cameras  or  satellites.
The approach uses various algorithms that identify cloud patterns
from  subsequent  images.  The  information  collected  from  subse-
quent images is converted into cloud motion vectors (CMV), which
encapsulate  the  magnitude  and  direction  of  the  displacement  of
individual clouds. CMV is used to forecast cloud cover, usually by
assuming persistence in cloud shape, velocity and transparency. Fi-
nally, a semi-empirical model is applied in order to obtain the so-
lar irradiance at ground level, from the predicted cloud cover.

CMVs  derived  from  ground-based  sky  imagers  are  useful  for
nowcasting or very short term forecasts, on time horizons of up
to a few hours. Over larger time intervals, the clouds can pass out
of the field of view of the camera. The satellite-based images on
the  other  hand,  are  images  with  a  wide  field  of  view,  but  with
lower space and time resolution, making them adequate for longer
term forecasts (day ahead or longer). Ref. [16] presents a compre-
hensive review of sky-imaging hardware and analysis techniques.
Fig. B3 from Appendix B shows a classification of the cloud motion
approaches in terms of taxonomy diagram.

1.3.5. Numerical weather predictions

Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) uses the current weather
conditions as input into mathematical models describing the pro-
cesses  occurring  in  the  atmosphere,  aiming  to  forecast  weather
in  a  future  period.  A  short  history  of  NWP  models  and  their

124

R. Blaga et al. / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 70 (2019) 119–144

evolution  followed  by  a  step-by-step  description  of  the  various
model  equations  and  how  to  solve  them  numerically  can  be
found  in  Ref.  [38] .  The  NWP  models  may  be  classified  in  two
groups  ( Fig.  B4  from  Appendix  B ):  (1)  General  Circulation  Mod-
els  (GCM),  which  describe  the  processes  at  global  scale  and  (2)
mesoscale  models,  whose  application  is  restricted  to  a  regional
area. Generally, the mesoscale models use boundary conditions ob-
tained  by  running  GCMs.  Among  GCMs,  the  most  popular  mod-
els are GFS – Global Forecast System [ http://www.emc.ncep.noaa.
gov/GFS/.php ] and - IFS, a model developed by the European Cen-
tre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) [ https://www.
ecmwf.int/ ]  while  among  the  mesoscale  models  one  may  quote
WRF  – Weather  Research  and  Forecasting  Model  [ https://www.
mmm.ucar.edu/weather-research-and-forecasting-model ]. WRF has
a wide range of physical parameterizations, which allow setting the
model for better capturing the physical processes peculiarities for
a given location, resolution and application.

NWP models are the basis of solar resources forecasts in time
horizon  ranging  between  6  and  72  h.  The  forecast  horizon  of
24 h. ahead is of particular interest for decision making in the en-
ergy market.

1.3.6. Hybrid models

The models from this class are built by combining two or more
methods  from  the  other  classes  (see  Fig.  B5  from  Appendix  B ).
Such a  model can compensate some of  the shortcomings of the
individual models, at the expense of added complexity. The hybrid
models fall into two broad categories.

The  first  category  includes  models  that  combine  CS  and  ML
models, either successively or in parallel on different components
of the solar irradiance series [39] . Studies on such combination of
forecasting models have been proposed by many researchers (e.g.
[40,41] ), indicating that the hybrid forecasting methods outperform
the individual forecasts. The parallel approach requires the a pri-
ori spectral decomposition of the measurements series, performed
commonly with Fourier or wavelet transform [42–44] .

The second category contains models that apply different post-
processing techniques (algorithms from CS or ML classes) to the
output of either a model from CM or NW class [23] . This is par-
ticularly useful for adjusting the NWP outputs to account for site-
specific sub-grid effects induced by the local climate or geography.
Forecast improvements are performed by comparing NWP output
to measured data during a training period, the results being used
subsequently to develop corrected forecasts. This type of approach
is  often  referred  to  as  MOS,  Model  Output  Statistics.  In  the  last
years different MOS approaches have been proposed. The simplest
but powerful types of MOS are bias removal and spatial averag-
ing, in other words adjusting the systematic forecast errors [45] .
Since these approaches do not combine two models from different
classes (as we defined the HY class), in this work we assigned such
models to NW class. The genuine hybrid MOS approaches (in sense
of the HY class definition) forecast global solar irradiance by com-
bining NWP outputs with CS and ML post-processing techniques.
For example, Ref. [46] deals with day ahead solar irradiance fore-
casts covering Reunion Island with a horizontal resolution of 3 km.
The WRF forecasts are refined with a Kalman filter using high qual-
ity ground measurements. The main feature of the post-processing
method is that it removes the bias in the global solar irradiance
forecasts  without  need  for  a  long-term  historical  data  database.
Ref. [47] explores a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in combi-
nation with two post-processing techniques (Neural Network and
Analog  Ensemble)  for  the  forecasting  of  wind  and  solar  irradi-
ance.  The  PCA  is  applied  to  reduce  the  datasets  dimension.  The
study  shows  that  combining  PCA  with  the  post-processing  tech-
niques leads to better results when compared to the implementa-
tion without the PCA reduction. The work [48] aims at combining

state-of-the-art  implementations  of  the  WRF  model  with  multi-
variate statistical learning techniques to provide accurate forecasts
of day-ahead hourly irradiance in Singapore. The authors show that
WRF-solar combined with the statistical learning method outper-
formed GFS for day-ahead forecasts of solar irradiance.

2. Methodology and data

2.1. Statistical indicators of accuracy in solar energy forecasting

A thorough description and discussion of the performance in-
dicators used in the solar energy modeling is presented in [49] .
The study emphasizes three basic features of the performance in-
dicators: (1) Most indicators are summary statistics that attempt to
synthesize the overall performance of a model with only one num-
ber,  (2)  There  is  a  strong  motivation  for  more  elaborate  metrics
(particularly those derived from the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test) and
(3) The major potential of visual indicators. Ref. [50] points out the
unavailability of a consistent and robust set of metrics to measure
the accuracy of a solar forecast and propose a suite of generally
applicable and value-based metrics for solar forecasting in a com-
prehensive set of scenarios (i.e., different time horizons, geographic
locations, and applications). In a subsequent paper [51] the same
research group reported the framework for deriving the target val-
ues for the suite of solar forecasting metrics. On the whole, the
methodology represents a reasonable approach that can be used
to assess the economic benefits gained from improvements in ac-
curacy of solar forecasting. The quality metric proposed in [52] , de-
fined as the ratio of solar uncertainty to solar variability, compares
the forecasting error with the solar variability directly. Unlike the
traditional statistical indicators (root mean square error, the deter-
mination coefficient, etc.) the proposed metric in [52] conveys a
measure of the variability of the time-series for the solar irradiance
data. From a different perspective there are proposals of metrics
very relevant in the context of ramp prediction such as prediction
interval coverage probabilities and prediction interval normalized
average widths.

Despite of the above observations a significant part of the pa-
pers  dealing  with  solar  resources  forecasting,  assess  the  results
only in terms of traditional statistical indicators of accuracy: mean
bias error MBE , root mean square error RMSE and mean absolute
error MAE. They are defined as [49] :

MBE ≡ 1
M

M (cid:5)

i =1

( c i − m i )

RMSE ≡

MAE ≡ 1

In order to compare the quality of models applied to samples
with different size, these indicators are usually normalized to the
mean μ =  1
i of measured data: nM BE = M BE /μ, nRM SE =
M
RMSE /μ and nM AE = M AE /μ respectively.

that

MBE  captures  overall  trends  or  biases  in  the  data.  A
positive/negative  value
the  model  overall
over/underestimates  the  predicted  quantity.  On  the  other  hand,
RMSE is very sensitive to large individual errors, since it contains
squared values. As such, it captures variability rather than overall
trends. MAE is somewhere in between, quantifying the prediction
errors with more emphasis on mean error and less on individual
extreme events.

125

Ref. [53] gives an assessment of the usefulness of these three
statistical  indicators  for  quantifying  forecast  errors  and  makes  a
set  of  recommendations  for  PV  industry  standards.  The  authors
define three time scales: a) operational (from minutes to hours),
b) management (from hours to days) and c) planning (from days
to weeks). The first two time scales broadly overlap the forecast
horizons classes used in this study: intra-hour (IH), intra-day (ID)
and day-ahead (DA). Ref. [53] outlines that for short-time scales,
forecasting extreme events (severe solar ramps) is the key require-
ment. Therefore, in order to assess the model performance, an ap-
propriate statistical indicator of accuracy is to be used. This means
that the indicator should be able to capture the model’s perfor-
mance in forecasting such events. Therefore, the most suitable in-
dicator is RMSE . Ref. [53] notes that the performance of a model
estimated in terms of MAE would be most appropriate for man-
agement purposes, while for long-term predictions and planning
the MBE should be used, because it captures overall trends rather
than variability.

There are numerous difficulties in comparing the results of dif-
ferent studies amongst themselves. The most often used quantifier
of forecast errors is the RMSE . It is sometimes accompanied by an-
other indicator, either MAE or MBE , and seldom by some others.
The indicators are regularly reported in absolute values, not in a
normalized form, which excludes inter-comparison from the out-
set. Furthermore, where normalized values are given, it is not al-
ways stated what the reference quantity is. Most of the time this is
the average value of the solar irradiance measurements at ground.
For example, another choice is the normalization to the maximum
−2
of the measured values or the peak nominal irradiance 10 0 0 Wm
used to rate the capacity of PV plants [54] . This choice has become
benchmark in the wind energy industry [55] . Occasionally also the
difference between the maximum and minimum measured values
is  used.  Ref.  [54]  also  shows  that  different  normalization  proce-
dures may lead to deviations as high as 50% for the same statistical
indicator. Based on the observations made in [54] , Ref. [12] pro-
poses the usage of the average value of measurements and peak
nominal irradiance for normalizing MBE and RMSE , respectively. In
our opinion, the average value of the measurements should be the
standard  for  normalizing  all  statistical  indicators  in  solar  energy
forecasting.

Another ambiguity arises from the choice of considering only
daylight measurements or considering the full 24-h. interval. Al-
though the solar irradiance is zero during nighttime, the inclusion
of these measurements in the dataset, changes the total number
of  data  entries  and  the  average  values  of  the  considered  quan-
tities. When the former choice is made, there is also a problem
with  the  threshold  value  below  which  solar  irradiance  data  are
excluded. However, this has been shown not to have a consider-
able  influence,  given  a  reasonable  choice  for  the  threshold.  Ref.
[54] shows that the inclusion of nighttime values increases nRMSE ,
leaves nMBE and nMAE unchanged, and decreases all other error
indicators. If the reported error indicators are normalized to the
average measured values, it would thus be counter-productive to
consider night-time values.

In  this  study,  we  have  included  all  choices  of  normalization.
The overwhelming majority of studies uses the average value of
measurements. Where it is not stated explicitly we assume this is
the case. As we consider papers reporting forecast performances
in terms of RMSE and MBE , normalized with average values, we
assume  that  daylight  values  have  been  considered  in  all  studies
where it is not stated explicitly.

Ref.  [13]  highlights  that  the  granularity  and  spatial  aggrega-
tion of the datasets on one hand and the testing periods on other
hand, play important roles, hindering the objective comparison of
the different models performance. Ideally, the scientific literature
should be extensive and comprehensive enough, such that all these

attributes can be averaged over, allowing statistically relevant con-
clusions to be drawn.

2.2. Selection criteria

At the first stage of the review process we have used Google
Scholar search engine. A concise introduction to scientific reviews
using Google Scholar along with a comprehensive review on his-
tory and trends in solar irradiance and PV power forecasting us-
ing  text  mining  can  be  read  in  Ref.  [56] .  The  study  reported  in
the current paper started with Google Scholar search. We searched
for “solar radiation forecasting” and the results (limited by default
in Google Scholar to one thousand) were ranked according to the
degree of overlap in the title and abstract of the papers with the
search terms and further prioritized according to the number of ci-
tations. We have included in our study only regular journal articles
and conference papers dealing with solar irradiance forecasting (as
opposed to output power forecasting). Only results published dur-
ing  the  period 2006–2017 have been considered.  This  procedure
has resulted in 162 papers, which were subjected to a further se-
lection as described below.

The criteria for a paper to be selected for this study are the

following:

(1) The paper has been published during the last decade.
(2) The subject of the paper is the forecasting of global solar irra-
diance or direct normal irradiance over time horizons between
minutes and several days.

(3) The  results  have  been  assessed  in  terms  of  both  nRMSE  and
nMBE,  or  equivalently,  these  indicators  can  be  obtained  from
the information that is provided.

The number of papers from the publications studied by us that
are  eligible  according  to  the  first  two  criteria  is  162  ([29,30,40–
47] and [57–207] ) and out of these 40 ([6,29,30,40,41,45,144–177])
satisfy the third criterion, and were thus included in our analysis.
From the 40 selected papers, we have collected the statistical in-
dicators of accuracy nRMSE and nMBE . The final quality-controlled
database contains 1705 entries (pairs of nRMSE and nMBE ), with
data from 88 locations spread across 18 countries (which includes
French off-seas territories and the US state of Hawaii, which have
been  classified  separately  to  highlight  their  remote  insular  loca-
tion). The locations are represented on the world map in Fig. 4 ,
along with the locations from the remaining 122 papers. We can
see that the studied publications cover all continents and climate
zones. The papers that are eligible according to the third criterion
are predominantly concentrated in Europe and the USA, along with
a number of locations spread throughout the rest of the world.

In  Fig.  4  and  consistently  throughout  this  paper,  the  Geiger-
Köppen  climate  classification  system  is  used  for  ascribing  the
climate  zones  to  land  surfaces.  The  Geiger-Köppen  data  down-
loaded from http://koeppen- geiger.vu- wien.ac.at/were plotted onto
the world map, from the maps library of the R programming lan-
guage. Only the main climate groups are considered: tropical (A),
dry/arid (B), temperate (C), continental/snow (D) and polar (E). As
none  of  the  forecasting  tests  refers  to  polar  climates,  we  effec-
tively work with the first four groups in our study. The data are
evenly distributed among the four climate groups: A–390, B–374,
C–647  and  D–294.  The  temperate  climate  group  is  naturally  the
most populated as most developed countries are situated in this
zone (western European countries, Japan, parts of the USA and of
Australia) and it is the most suitable for current PV applications.
On the other hand, some of the newly industrialized and devel-
oping countries, like China, India, Brazil, Mexico, Chile, are some
of the largest investors in renewable energies in the present [209] .
These countries reside mostly in tropical and arid climate regions.
As PV applications become more effective when operating under

and persistence (PS). According to the forecast horizon the data are
categorized into three classes: intra-hour (IH), intra-day (ID) and
day-ahead (DA) forecasts.

Table 1 shows a large diversity of the models’ nature. For moti-
vating our classification in respect to this criterion, a brief descrip-
tion of the papers follows, with focus on the forecasting models’
nature.

2.3.1. Classical statistical models

Keywords: autoregression, removing seasonality/detrending, in-
sular  vs.  continental  site,  AR/ARMA/ARIMA,  state  space  models,
nonparametric  bootstrap,  vector  autoregressive  model,  prediction
filters.

2.3.1.1. ARIMA.  Ref. [6] introduces four new tailored models, based
on  ARIMA  type  regression,  upgraded  with  different  physically
motivated  features.  A  combined  model  (ARMA  and  GARCH)  for
solar  irradiance  forecasting  at  IH  and  ID  time  horizons  is  re-
ported  by  [29] .  GARCH  (Generalized  AutoRegressive  Conditional
Heteroskedasticity),  typically  used  in  financial  series,  is  proved
suitable for modeling the variability of high-frequency data [29] .
The performances of ARMA and ANN models at continental and
coastal versus insular sites are compared in [30] .

The data from insular sites prove to be more difficult to fore-
cast, independently of the model used [30] . Ref. [144] proposes an
innovative  method  for  short-term  forecasting  of  solar  irradiance.
The method is based on forecasting the sunshine number, a binary
variable stating if the sun shining or not on the sky, from which
the solar irradiance is reconstructed using a clear sky model and
information about cloud transmittance.

2.3.1.2. Other autoregressive (AR) models.  Ref. [145] deals with solar
irradiance  forecasts  using  an  Exponential  Smoothing  State  Space
model and report good results for high-resolution data. A model
based on Nonparametric Bootstrap for probabilistic forecasting of
solar irradiance is introduced in [146] . The method gives good re-
sults and, at the same time, it is computationally very efficient. Ref.
[147] proposes a Vector Autoregressive Model suitable for forecast-
ing on sparse spatio-temporal data. A comparative study about the

the  increased  solar  output  conditions  around  the  equator  (espe-
cially in the cloudless desert areas), without drastically losing con-
version efficiency, it is expected that these countries’ share in the
renewable energy market will increase. It is thus prescient to study
the climate-sensibility of forecasting models.

tistical methods (CS), machine learning (ML), cloud motion track-
ing (CM), numerical weather prediction (NW), hybrid models (HY)

effect on solar irradiance forecasts of the time-series seasonal ad-
justment is reported by [148] . Various types of statistical models
are tested at 1-h. time horizon and a time-adaptive procedure for
fitting the models parameters is proposed.

2.3.1.3. Prediction  filter.  2-D  linear  prediction  filter  approach  for
predicting  hourly  solar  irradiance  is  used  in  Ref.  [149] .  Differ-
ent multi-dimensional filters are applied to data, from which the
forecasted  values  of  the  solar  irradiance  are  extracted.  The  per-
formance  of  dynamic  harmonic  regression  model  for  predicting
hourly  global  horizontal  irradiance  is  investigated  by  [150] .  The
proposed model, based on Kalman filter and fixed interval smooth-
ing algorithm, operates in the frequency domain.

2.3.2. Machine learning

Keywords:  Artificial  Neural  Networks,  Muti  Layer  Perceptron,
Support  Vector  Machine,  Random  Forest,  Neuro-Fuzzy  Estimator,
Gaussian Processes

2.3.2.1. Artificial neural network.  Ref. [151] reports an artificial neu-
ral network using as input predicted meteorological variables from
a weather forecasting database. Two models, a k-nearest neighbor
and an artificial neural network model for forecasting global solar
irradiance on IH intervals, are proposed by [152] . The performance
of the models is found to be good in general, but varying strongly
with the local climate [152] . A Multilayer Perceptron Neural Net-
work model is introduced by [153] , which takes as input past ir-
radiance and temperature measurements. The model is applied for
day ahead forecasts with good results [153] . Sometimes the Multi-
layer Perceptron models for day ahead forecasts of solar irradiance
are found to outperform CS class models [154] .

2.3.2.2. Other  ML  techniques.  Ref  [155]  introduces  two  machine
learning  models,  Support  Vector  Regression  and  Random  Forest,
respectively, which take as input meteorological records. The mod-
els, show significant improvement over persistence and other refer-
ence models [155] . A neuro-fuzzy estimator based on meteorolog-
ical input for medium term forecasting is reported by [156] . Ref.
[157] performs a thorough analysis of ML forecasting techniques
(NNs,  Gaussian  Processes  and  SVM).  The  authors  concluded  that
the ML models perform comparably to the simpler AR models at
IH intervals, while for larger horizons the former show much bet-
ter results than the latter.

2.3.3. Cloud motion tracking

Keywords: all-sky camera, satellite images, cloud tracking; max-

imum cross-correlation method

2.3.3.1. Ground based sky imagers.  A study on the use of ground
based  sky-images  for  predicting  solar  irradiance  over  IH  periods
was presented in [158] . A frozen cloud advection model was used
to extrapolate the location of clouds. Differently, [159] use a regres-
sion technique to predict the clearness index from all-sky images,
from which solar irradiance is subsequently derived.

2.3.3.2. Satellite based sky imagers Refs.  [160] and [161] reports a
forecast model based on cloud motion vectors extracted from se-
quences  of  satellite  images.  Beam,  diffuse  and  global  irradiance
are  forecasted  separately  on  IH  horizons.  For  beam  and  global
radiation,  the  nRMSE  value  is  lower  than  10%  under  clear  skies.
Ref. [162] proposes a satellite-to-irradiance model, which relies on
cloud motion vectors generated from sequences of satellite images
and improved with ground data. An extensive validation of vari-
ous models for both ID and DA horizons is reported in [163] . The
models used for ID horizons are based on cloud motion vectors

derived from satellite images, while the model used for DA hori-
zons rely on gridded cloud cover data from a public database. The
authors use the maximum cross-correlation method to obtain the
cloud motion vectors. The models are tested against ground mea-
surements [163] .

2.3.4. Numerical weather prediction

Keywords: Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP), Weather Re-
search  and  Forecasting  (WRF),  Global  Environmental  and  Multi-
scale Model (GEM), post-processing data

2.3.4.1. Numerical weather prediction.  Ref. [164] compares the per-
formance  of  three  NWP  models  for  ID  forecasts.  A  thorough  as-
sessment of some of the well-established NWP models is reported
by [165] . Ref. [166] results of testing a WRF-based model for DA
predictions at a location in Spain. Both global horizontal and di-
rect normal irradiance are forecasted. The model presents signifi-
cant improvement over persistence [166] . A comprehensive anal-
ysis,  comprising  independent  validations  of  different  NWP  mod-
els, with a focus on post-processing for site-specific forecasts, is
reported in [167] . A simple averaging of the outputs of all NWP
models proves to be significantly more accurate than the indepen-
dent results of each model. A WRF-based model was developed in
[168] . The model performance was assessed for both ID and DA
forecasting.

2.3.4.2. NWP  with  post-processing.  The  performance  of  DNI  fore-
casts based on a WRF model is evaluated in Ref. [169] . The authors
show  that  spatial  averaging  of  the  predictions  significantly  im-
proves the forecasts accuracy by reducing the errors. Ref. [45] ap-
plies  two  post-processing  techniques  (spatial  averaging  and  bias
removal) to forecasts obtained using the Global Environmental and
Multiscale model. DA forecasts of DNI using different NWP-based
models, to which re-forecasting methods are applied to improve
accuracy, is reported by [170] .

2.3.5. Hybrid models

Keywords:  Classical  statistics,  Mycielsky  algorithm,  Support
Vector Machine with Particle Swarm Optimization, combination AR
with ANN, hybrid exponential smoothing, decomposition methods,
Markov chain.

2.3.5.1. Classical statistics and machine learning hybrid models.  Ref.
[41] introduces a model based on the Mycielsky algorithm, which
looks  for  sub-patterns  in  time  series,  combined  with  Markov
chains  to  forecast  hourly  solar  irradiance.  Ref.  [40]  proposes  a
model that combines Self-Organizing Maps, used for the decompo-
sition of the time series, and Support Vector Machine with Particle
Swarm Optimization for forecasting solar irradiance.

2.3.5.2. Adaptive  models.  Ref.  [171]  introduces  a  model  based  on
a combination of a linear autoregressive process and an artificial
neural network. The data series is decomposed using various meth-
ods,  and  different  models  are  applied  adaptively  on  each  com-
ponent, resulting in a hybrid model that shows improved perfor-
mance as compared to the simple models. A novel adaptive ap-
proach, which alternates between forecasting with linear predic-
tion filter and using an empirical statistical model, is reported by
[172] . The choice between the two approaches is made according
to whether the clearness index is below or above a given thresh-
old value. A method of forecasting DNI that uses wavelet decom-
position on clear-sky index time series is reported by [173] . The
proposed model applies a regression model on the longer wave-
length components and a SVM algorithm on the rapidly varying
components of the solar irradiance. The results show that the hy-
brid model performs significantly better than the reference AR and
ML models separately [173] .

2.3.5.3. Other hybrid models.  Ref. [174] introduces a model that re-
lies on satellite images, to which a hybrid exponential smoothing
state space combined with an artificial neural network model is
applied. A post-processing technique, called Model Output Statis-
tics, applied to Meteosat NWP predictions is reported by [175] . Ref.
[176] presents an improved MOS routine based on a linear regres-
sion  algorithm,  which  takes  as  input  a  large  number  of  meteo-
rological variables resulting from NWP simulations. Correction of
the NWP results with the introduced method shows a significant
improvement over both the raw output and the correction with a
simpler equation based on solar zenith angle and clearness index.
Ref. [177] introduces an algorithm called MOS cascade, which ap-
plies two different types of MOS to outputs of the WRF model.

2.4. Description of the dataset

The dataset analyzed in this study consists of pairs of nRMSE
and nMBE collected from all the selected 40 papers discussed in
Section 2.3 .

Fig. 5 summarizes the performance of the forecasting models,
as it has been reported by the selected papers, in terms of average
quality of the forecasts. The averages are calculated over all values
of nRMSE and nMBE , respectively, reported by a given paper. The
plot is per se illustrative, not quantitative. The size of the circles is
related to the number of entries in the dataset from a given paper,
and as such, the plot highlights which ones have the largest weight
in terms of number of data entries. It can be observed from the fig-
ure, that from the 40 papers, some contain only a handful of data
entries while others comprise a significant fraction of the whole
dataset. The results are distributed randomly throughout the do-
main of nRMSE and nMBE values, including ones with small nRMSE
but large nMBE and vice-versa. This is a good indication that the
application of the selection criteria results in a random sample.

In our study, we divide the dataset according to various crite-
ria, such as the model class, forecast horizon, climate zone and the
year of publication, both in detailed and coarse categories. Most
of the analysis are performed on classes broken down over one or
two criteria. If we would further sub-divide the dataset, the result-
ing subsets may be too small to draw statistically sound conclu-
sions from them. This limitation is due to the scarcity of the sci-
entific literature in the field of solar resources forecasting. Thus, in
this study, we aim for soft conclusions, which can be drawn from
the available data.

According to their nature, the analyzed models are categorized
into six classes (see Section 1.3 ). Table 2 shows the dataset dis-
tributed into the six classes.

According  to  the  forecast  horizon  (cid:6)t ,  the  data  are  catego-
rized into three classes of forecasts: IH intra-hour ( (cid:6)t ≤ 1 hour),
ID  intra-day  (1 hour  <  (cid:6)t  <  6 hours)  and  DA  day-ahead  ( (cid:6)t  >
12 hours).  Table  3  shows  the  dataset  distributed  into  the  three
classes. The data are reasonably well distributed, with none of the

Fig. 6.  Two-dimensional histogram of the dataset, broken down by class of models
and time horizon of the forecast. The relative height and width of the bars represent
the relative sizes of the different data subsets. For example, looking on the vertical
axis, 60% of the data from the cloud motion class (CM) falls roughly into the intra-
hour class (IH), 40% into intra-day class (ID) and the day ahead class (DA) is not
populated. Looking on the horizontal axis, roughly 10% of the entire dataset falls
into the cloud motion class (CM).

data subsets too small. Overall the granularity of the data ranges
between 15 seconds and 1 h The subset IH contains the greatest
diversity in both data granularity and forecast horizons. The gran-
ularity takes values from 15 sec. to one hour ( Table 3 ), with a quite
uniform distribution. ID forecasts and DA forecasts are (almost) ex-
clusively performed on hourly solar irradiance data series.

The  2-dimensional  histogram  presented  in  Fig.  6  displays  a
qualitative picture of the relative sizes of the different data sub-
sets, i.e. the number of entries in different subsets. Visual inspec-
tion shows that the data is reasonably well distributed. The most
significant bias, recognizable with the naked eye, is the fact that
the models from CS and CM are rarely used for DA forecasts, while
models from NW are predominantly applied for DA forecasts, and
seldom for ID and IH forecasts. The number of entries in the CS
and NW classes is visible larger than the dimension of the others,
however, the ratio between the largest and smallest class is around
4, which is reasonable for performing statistical analysis.

From a different perspective, Fig. 7 presents the forecast accu-
racy per model classes and per forecast horizon classes. Visual in-
spection shows that the models from the CS class have on aver-
age the smallest nMBE , followed closely by those of the PS and HY
models, then the ML and CM classes, and finally, with significantly

larger errors, the NW models. In terms of nRMSE , the models from
the CM and ML class perform best, followed in order by those from
the HY, CS, NW and PS class. Apparently, Fig. 7 suggests that the
NW models on average perform poorly, having large systematic bi-
ases; however in order to obtain in depth understanding one needs
to look at the interdependence of model class and forecast horizon,
and the relative number of entries in each subset of the dataset. In
this case, the large errors are because NW models are applied pre-
dominantly for DA forecasts. Furthermore, the average values hide
information about the spreading of the errors (quantified in terms
of the standard deviation) at which we look in more detail below.
In addition, it is interesting to note the relatively small bias errors
introduced by the PS models, which sets quite high standards for
newly developed forecast models. The CS, HY and ML models have
comparable biases with the PS ones, but the CM models have con-
siderably larger errors, and the ones from the NW class have very
high errors compared to it. On the other hand, in terms of nRMSE
the PS models perform the poorest, as expected. This observation
draws attention, from the outset, to the need for having several dif-
ferent types of indicators for the performance of forecast models.
This is particularly important to note, as most studies emphasize
the nRMSE of the forecasts, but this is only sometimes accompa-
nied by another indicator ( nMBE, nMAE , skill of improvement over
persistence), and very rarely by several. From Fig. 7 b we can ob-
serve that, as expected, the IH predictions are the most accurate in
terms of nRMS E, followed by those of the ID and the DA forecasts.
In terms of nMBE , surprisingly, the forecasts over ID time scales
perform slightly better than the IH ones. Forecasts over DA time
scales are encountered by significantly larger errors than the IDs
and IHs.

3. Performance analysis of the forecasting models

In this section, the data series of nMBE and nRMSE, collected
from  the  papers included in  this  study,  are  assessed statistically
in  terms  of  box  plot  (graphically  depicting  groups  of  numerical
data through their quartiles) and standard deviation (quantifying
the amount of variation in a dataset):

The  analysis  is  performed  from  four  perspectives:  classes  of
forecasting models, time-horizon, climate and performance trend
over time.

3.1. Classes of forecasting models

The variation in nMBE and nRMSE data is presented in Fig. 8 in
terms of box plot. The distribution is qualitatively quite different in
the six classes of forecasting models:

- PS: The models from this class represent the simplest type of
forecasts, used generally as benchmarks for other models and
as  such  are  expected  to  perform  poorly.  This  is  indeed  the
case if one looks at the forecast errors quantified in terms of
nRMSE , for which it presents both the highest values among all
classes (mean nRMSE = 43.1%) and the highest volatility of er-
rors ( σ nRMSE = 21.9). In terms of mean bias error, the average
error  is  in  fact  quite  small  (mean  nMBE = −0.14%),  similar  to
those  from  the  CS,  ML  and  HY  classes,  and  significantly  bet-
ter than the CM and NW models. The volatility of the mean
bias  errors  is  also  good  ( σ nMBE = 3.23),  with  even  the  larger
over/undercasts being consistently below 15%. This shows that
persistence forecasts have in general low systematic biases, but
can have very large singular errors. Considering that persistence
models make predictions based on the last measurements, we
can  assume  that  the  large  errors  happen  when  the  radiative
regime is unstable, i.e. fast moving broken clouds on the sky.

• CS: Models from this class have the smallest average mean
bias errors, and also the volatility of the bias errors is the
smallest ( σ nMBE = 1.89). Overall the CS models perform qual-
itatively similarly with the PS models, having very small sys-
tematic biases, but considerably large nRMSE . The CS mod-
els however, outperform the latter on every account, most
considerably in terms of the volatility of the nRMSE errors,
which is small ( σ nRMSE = 12.92).

• ML : Models from this class have relatively small mean biases
on average. The volatility of the bias errors however, is quite
large( σ nMBE = 8.52). This comes from large positive outliers
which represents significant overcasts, some larger than 15%,
while  the  undercasts  are  all  below  10%.  As  we  shall  see
later, these large errors arise when applying ML models to
large horizons forecasts. In terms of nRMSE , the errors are
very small, with the average error being nRMSE = 23.3%. The
volatility of the nRMSE s is similar to that of the CS class.

• CM : Models from this class have notably larger bias errors
than PS, with a clear tendency for overcasting. The volatil-
ity  of  the  bias  errors  is  also  quite  large  at  ( σ nMBE = 5.46).
The performance in terms of nRMSE on the other hand, is
the best among all classes, with an average error of (mean
nRMSE = 22.8%) and volatility of errors just a bit larger than
that of the CS models.

• NW:  At  first  glance,  the  models  from  this  class  seem  to
have the poorest performance. They have large bias errors,
with volatility ( σ nMBE = 8.88). There is significant tendency
of overestimating, however outliers are larger than 20% for
both  over-  and  under-estimation.  In  terms  of  nRMSE  the
situation  is very interesting.  The average error  is large, at
nRMSE = 40.4%, but the volatility is comparable to the mod-
els from the CS, ML and CM class and significantly smaller
than  that  of  the  PS  class.  As  we  shall  see  later,  part  of
the explanation for the large errors is that the NW models
are predominantly used for large horizon forecasts (mainly
DA). The large nRMSE with small volatility means that these
models  produce  large  errors  systematically,  not  stochasti-
cally, which gives hope that the models accuracy might be
improved by post-processing of the outputs.

• HY : The models from this class combine the best that the
other  classes  have  to  offer.  Consequently,  they  have  small
nMBE s and reasonable nRMSE s, both with small volatilities.
Actually, the performance of these models is obscured partly
by the fact that HY class encompasses forecasts on the en-
tire  range  of  time  scales,  from  models  tailored  for  IH  to
those  tailored  for  DA.  When  we  perform  the  analysis  of
HY models per classes of forecast horizon, we shall see in
Section 3.2 that these models have excellent performance on
each class.

3.2. Forecasting horizon

Before  moving  further  with  the  forecasting  horizon  analysis,
some comments about data granularity and its impact on the fore-
casts  accuracy  are  presented.  While  most  studies  from  IH  class
perform  one-step-ahead  forecasts,  there  are  some  studies  where
minute (or smaller) granularity data are used for predictions at one
hour ahead. This probably accounts for a significant amount of the
volatility within the IH data subset. Roughly half of the ID fore-
casts are one-step-ahead, with the other half being several steps
(most studies of this type include time horizons between 1 and ei-
ther 6 or 12 h.). The DA forecasts entail a large number of time

steps. Some volatility is clearly induced by the multi-step forecasts
for both ID and DA classes. The universally used (hourly) granu-
larity makes the comparison between results within each forecast
horizon quite robust. However, taking into account the broad range
of data granularity, the inter-comparison of models from different
forecast horizon classes is sometimes questionable. The diversity
within  classes  is  expected  to  be  averaged  out,  as  the  literature
grows in bulk, while the inter-class differences are systemic and
pertain to the nature of the forecasting models.

Generally, the dataset considered in this study shows that the
forecast accuracy decreases with increasing ratio of forecast hori-
zon to data granularity. This behavior is most predominant within
the IH class, taking into account that this class has the largest di-
versity in granularity and forecast horizons. For example, for the
same 5 min. forecast horizon, the forecast error depends signifi-
cantly on the granularity as follows: (1) Ref. [156] reports nRMSE
below 10% for one-step-ahead forecasts (i.e. 5 m granularity data);
(2)  Ref.  [159]  reports  results  for  1-minute  data,  with  nRMSE  of
around 25%; (3) Ref. [158] reports results for 30 s data, with a large
volatility in results. nRMSE values are of 20% on average, and occa-
sionally take values higher than 40%; (4) Ref. [144] reports results
for 15 s data, with nRMSE often above 30% .

Fig. 9 displays the dataset broken down by categories of fore-
cast horizon. The plot confirms our previous observations that IH
and ID forecasts, performed mainly with CS and ML methods, have
good performance in terms of nMBE and nRMSE . IH forecasts reach-
ing on average smaller values of nRMSE than the ID forecasts. The
DA forecasts are less reliable. As we have seen earlier, the nRMSE
increases with the increase of the time scale of the forecast. This
can be seen from the mean and medians, and also from the first
and third quartiles of the nRMSE distribution ( Table 4 ).

Fig. 10 presents in detail the dependence of nRMSE and nMBE
on time horizon. The forecast horizon values have not been strat-
ified into coarse categories. Note that the forecast horizon values
on the x axis are not equidistant. The time horizons for which data
were available are as follows: 15 sec., 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50 min.,
1 h, 1 h15 min., 1 h30 min., 1 h45 min., 2 h, 2 h15 min., 2 h30 min.,
2 h45 min., 3 h, 4 h, 5 h, 6 h and 1, 2, d, 4, 5, 6, 7 days ahead.

The values of nMBE s presented in Fig. 10 a have an interesting
behavior. The PS errors increase from very small values for IH time
horizons, stabilize at ID values and slightly decrease for larger DA
forecasts. The behavior of the CS, ML and HY models mimics the
PS behavior, with similar variation as a function of forecast hori-
zons and overall comparable magnitudes. The models from the CM
class are studied for IH and ID forecasts only, while the NW mod-

forecasts. The CS models show a much slower time variation, hav-
ing larger errors than PS at IH forecasts and smaller ones at DA
times. The ML models show a very similar behavior with the PS
ones, but with much lighter increase in errors at ID times. No val-
ues are available for DA forecasts. The CM models perform remark-
ably well for ID forecasts. The NW models are used mainly for DA
forecasts,  where  they  have  smaller  errors  than  PS,  which  slowly
grow with the forecast horizon.

The interpretation of Fig. 10 has to be considered with care, as
the different subsets may have very small number of data entries.
The ones that do have large number of data entries are the 1 h
and 1d horizons, which may be considered representative ID and
DA forecasts. It is thus expected that the performance of the mod-
els for these horizons to be statistically representative. For IH fore-
casts, no single time horizon is representative enough and, thus,
we chose to average over the whole class. Results are presented in
Fig. 11 .

- IH horizon: The PS models represent a good reference bench-
mark for newly developed models. Only the models from the
ML  and  HY  class  show  better  performance,  both  in  terms  of
nMBE  and  nRMSE .  The  HY  class  consists  of  only  one  model
reported  by  [159] .  They  introduce  a  wavelet  forecast  model
and study its performance for DNI forecasting. The model con-
sists in decomposing the DNI time series using a wavelet tech-
nique  and  applying  various  AR  and  SVM  models  on  the  low
and high frequency components, respectively. The ML class, al-
though not showing a performance as good as the HY model, it
still contains a larger dataset and the forecasts are performed
on  GHI.  The  CM  models  show  good  enough  performance  in

els are used for DA forecasts (also some data exist for 1h-ahead
predictions). Both classes have mean bias errors much larger than
the ones from all the other classes.

In  terms  of  nRMSE  the  PS  forecasts  have  small  errors  for  IH
prediction. The errors slowly grow with time, then start growing
rapidly for ID forecasts and finally flatten at a large value for DA

terms of nRMSE ; however it introduces large mean biases. By
contrast, the CS models have small bias errors, but introduce
large nRMSE values. This latter observation is unexpected and
it may be due to the large number of data points. This does
not  exclude  the  possibility  that  any  singular  CS  model  per-
forms well on this horizon. Overall, we recommend using mod-
els from the ML class for forecasting at IH.

- 1 h  horizon:  The  models  from  the  CS,  ML,  CM  and  HY  show
a bias comparable with the models from PS class. In terms of
nRMSE , both CM and ML models present improvements over PS,
while the performance of the CS and HY models is considerably

weaker. The NW performs poorly as compared to all other mod-
els. We recommend the CM models for performing ID forecasts.
- 1d horizon: In this case,  even if  all the PS  models introduce
very small mean biases, their performance is poor, having the
largest nRMSE . The CS and HY models present the smallest er-
rors. The CS class contains very few entries and the very low
errors may not be representative. The HY models are all NWP-
type models, to the output of which post-processing techniques
where applied. Similarly, the NW models are NWP models, but
without post-processing and show significantly weaker results.
Finally, the ML models seem completely inappropriate for pre-

dictions  at  this  time  scale.  Overall,  we  recommend  using  HY
(NWP + MOS) models for performing DA forecasts.

3.3. Climate influence

Fig.  12  shows  the  dataset  in  terms  of  box  plot  broken  down
over climate zone. The models are assessed in terms of the mean
and standard deviation of nMBE and nRMSE. The mean and stan-
dard deviation were calculated over all available data in a climate
zone. In the case of nMBE a large positive or negative mean value is
a sign that the measurements has been over- or under-estimated,
while the standard deviation quantifies the amplitude of the fore-
cast errors. Forecasts in the tropical zone have very good perfor-
mances, both in terms of nMBE and nRMSE values. In fact, it has
the lowest average bias error (mean nMBE = −0.64%) and volatil-
ity of errors ( σ A
nMBE = 2 . 06 ) . The models performance in terms of
nRMSE is also good, and has the lowest volatility ( σ A
nRMSE = 11 . 96 ) .
The forecasts in the arid climate tend to overestimate the measure-
ments with a mean bias of nMBE = 2.1%, but achieving the smallest
mean nRMSE of 2.1%, with low volatility. In the temperate regions
the forecasts have large errors in terms of both nMBE and nRMSE
(mean nMBE = 1.7% and mean nRMSE = 26.4%).

nMBE = 9 . 55 ,  σ A

Also, they are very volatile ( σ A

nRMSE = 17 . 7 ) . The
errors for snow climate zones are the largest on average, but have
smaller volatility than those performed in the moderate climates.
From the above observations, we can conclude that the available
solar resource may be forecasted in a reliable way in regions with
tropical and arid climate, with accuracy greater than in moderate
climates.

Next,  we  look  at  the  distribution  of  data  into  model  classes
and forecast horizon classes for each climate group. The subsets of
data are well equilibrated in any of the four climate groups, with
the partition given in Tables 5 and 6 . Among the studies included
in  this  analysis,  very  few  use  CM  and  NW  models  in  the  tropi-
cal climate-zone. This may be explained by the fact that the ra-
diative regime is often unstable in tropical regions, especially con-
sidering that the most locations from our study are insular. This

makes forecasting difficult in general and long-term forecasts par-
ticularly unreliable. Considering that, as we have seen from Fig. 10 ,
the  studies  that  use  models  from  the  NW  class  perform  mainly
day-ahead forecasts, thus the low number of such studies applied
to stations in tropical areas is understandable. The reluctance in
performing day-ahead forecasts for tropical regions is confirmed in
Table 5 . The other notable aspect found in Table 5 is that very few
ML models are applied in locations with snow climate. Also, from
Table 6 , we note that IH forecasts are rarely performed in location
with snow climate. We conjecture that this may be related with
the more stable radiative regimes in snow climates, which allows
relatively accurate day-ahead forecasts

In order to see the influence of the climate on the performance
of the forecast models, we must look at the way in which the rela-
tive performance of the models from different classes changes per
each category of forecast horizon.

Fig. 13 shows the values nMBE and nRMSE from IH class per
each climate region. The PS, CS and ML models have comparable
errors in terms of nMBE over all climates, with the exception of C,
where the CS models have very high errors. The HY models have
similar performance as the first three classes as indicated by the
nMBE values, and represent significant improvements over them in
terms of nRMSE . The HY class contains only one model, reported
by [173] and tested for all climates. The CM models have large bi-
ases and root mean square errors for both arid and temperate cli-
mates where data are available. According to [53] , the nRMSE er-
ror is the most relevant at IH horizons. Based on the performance
assessment  presented  in  Fig.  13 ,  the  ML  or  HY  models  are  thus
recommended for such short-term forecasts. Note that individual
ARIMA-type models might also perform very well [210] , in spite of
the CS class, which as a whole has only limited performance.

The  ID  forecast  errors  for  each  climate  zone  are  represented
in Fig. 14 . The situation is interesting, as the PS mean bias errors
seem to jump around, being the lowest out of all models for trop-
ical and temperate climates and the largest for arid and snow cli-
mates. The ML and CS models show low errors consistently over
all climate types. The HY models perform well at sites locates in

tropical and snow local climates, and poorly in temperate climate.
The CM and NW models perform less well overall than the other
models. In terms of nRMSE the picture is a little bit clearer. The
PS models have quite large errors over all climate regions. The CS
shows a small improvement over PS, while the HY and ML mod-
els perform much better than PS, in all climates but the temperate
zone. In the temperate climate only the ML models show an im-
provement over PS, while the models from the CS and HY class
perform  worse.  CM  models  consistently  perform  better  than  PS,
with  a  larger  improvement  in  the  arid  and  snow  climates,  and
a  smaller  one  in  the  temperate  climate  (data  are  not  available
in tropical regions). The NW models have a weaker performance
than PS, for the B and C climates, where data are available. Ref.
[3]  suggests  that  the  nMAE  is  the  most  relevant  error  metric  at
this  time  scale.  In  its  absence,  we  look  at  nRMSE  for  classifying
the model performances. The situation is very interesting as most
models  present  improvements over  PS,  but  none  of  them  is  the
best in all climate zones. In fact, based on the results included in
our study and presented in Fig. 14 a, the ML and HY models are
recommended  for  tropical  climate  (A),  ML  and  CM  for  arid  and
temperate climates (C), and CS and HY for csnow climate (D), re-
spectively.

The DA forecasts are mainly performed with models from the
PS,  NW  and  HY  classes  ( Fig.  15 ).  The  latter  ones  are  NWP-type
models, with and without post-processing techniques. Surprisingly,
the  PS  models  have  very  small  mean  biases  for  all  climate  re-
gions. The HY models show an improvement over PS for the trop-
ical and snow climate, while for the arid and temperate climate
they have larger errors. The NW models are weaker than the HY
models  for  all  climates.  In  terms  of  nRMSE ,  the  PS  models  have
large errors, over which the NW models show a slight improve-
ment, and the HY models perform much better. The relative per-
formances maintain over all climate regions. For the temperate cli-
mate, data are available also for ML and CS models. The former
performs poorly, while the latter seems to perform much better
than  all  other  models.  The  CS  class  contains  a  single  model  re-
ported in [154] . Note that most of the data are from [167] , which
despite being a very rigorous study, is restricted to locations across

the  USA.  Also  note  the  lack  of  validation  of  models  from  other
classes, although these are expected to perform poorly for DA fore-
casts.  The  HY  models  have  very  good  performance  overall  both
in  terms  of  nMBE  and  nRMSE  and  we  recommend  them  for  us-
age  over  all  climate  regions.  However,  more  studies  are  needed,
including testing models from other classes and sites around the
globe,  to  see  whether  such  forecasting  models  show  an  actual
improvement  over  persistence  (especially  in  arid  and  temperate
climates).

3.4. Trend over time

As seen in Fig. 1 , the number of publications concerning fore-
casting solar irradiance has increased exponentially during the last
decade. It is worth checking whether the increased interest in the
subject materializes into quantifiable overall improvement of fore-
casts accuracy. In order to analyze this, we look at our dataset of
forecast errors with respect to the year of publication of each en-
try.

Fig. 16 presents the nMBE and nRMSE with respect to the year
of publication of the studies, in semi-logarithmic scale. The fore-
casting errors can never be reduced to zero. This would only be
possible if we had a complete physical model, together with suffi-
ciently high-resolution initial conditions, for exactly simulating the
entire atmosphere. Therefore, it is natural for new researches to
provide  progressively  smaller  improvements  in  forecasting  accu-
racy over time. A decreasing exponential fit is then most suited
for estimating the yearly trend of the forecasts errors.

The  linear  fit  with  slope α on  the  logarithmic  quantities  de-
picted in Fig. 16 , translates into a variation with a factor of exp ( α)
in the value of the errors. The linear fit for log | nMBE | as a function
of publication year is α = −0.12, which means that the mean bias
error decreases with a factor of exp ( − 0.12) = 0.89 per year. This
means that under a five-year period, the bias error reduces with
a factor of 0.89 5 = 0.55 (to almost half of its value), and under 10
years it reduces to roughly a third from its initial value. The slope
of the linear fit of log( nRMSE) as a function of publication year is
α = −0.05, which means that the root mean square error decreases

with a factor of 0.95 each year, with 0.78 under a 5 year period,
and 0.61 under a 10 year period (i.e. roughly two thirds from its
initial value).

Finally, we want to mention that the progress experienced in
forecasting  the  solar  energy  production  is  one  of  the  facets  of
maintaining the stability of the power grid partly fed by PV plants.
On a different perspective a huge effort is paid for accurately fore-
casting the load [211] of a power grid. The increase of photovoltaics
weight in the energy may be a result of the progress in both fields.

hybrid models have very good performance and we recom-
mend them for usage over all climate regions.

(4) Performance trend over time. Generally, the accuracy of the
forecasting  models  increased  in  time.  Our  analysis  shows
that over the last ten years the forecasting errors decreased
significantly,  on  average  nMBE  being  reduced  with  two
thirds  and  nRMSE  being  reduced  with  one  third,  as  com-
pared to the values at the beginning of the considered pe-
riod.

4. Conclusions

This study presented an in-depth analysis of the performance
of solar irradiance forecasting models. The study has gone beyond
the  main  limitations  of  previous  works,  namely  the  difficulty  of
comparing different forecasting models due to the large number
of different metrics used for assessing the models’ performance. A
rigorous framework for comparing different classes of models was
introduced, thus generating a reliable picture of the state-of-the-
art in the accuracy of solar resources forecasting. The results can
be stratified from four perspectives:

(1) Classes of forecasting models (persistence, classical statistics,
machine learning, cloud-motion tracking, numerical weather
prediction and hybrid models). The forecasting models from
the hybrid class (combining classical statistics with machine
learning approach and/or exogenous inputs) demonstrate the
best performance, which is not expected at first sight.

(2) Time-horizon  (intra-hour,  intra-day  and  day  ahead).  The
forecasting error measured by nRMSE increases with the in-
crease of the time scale of the forecast. Intra-hour forecasts
reach on average smaller values of nRMSE than the intra-day
forecasts while the day-ahead forecasts are less reliable.
(3) Climate influence (tropical, arid, temperate and snow). For
all climate regions, the models from the machine learning
and  hybrid  classes  are  recommended  for  intra-hour  fore-
casts. The individual ARIMA-type models may also perform
well,  in  spite  of  the  classical  statistics  class,  which  as  a
whole has only limited performance. For intra-day forecasts,
the models from the machine learning and classical statistics
classes show low errors consistently over all climate types.
The  hybrid  models  perform  well  at  sites  located  in  trop-
ical  and  snow  local  climates.  For  day-ahead  forecasts,  the

At a general level, it can be concluded that there are currently
still significant gaps in the literature. This is partially due to the
scientific paradigm, which does not encourage the publication of
negative results. In the context of our study, this would entail re-
porting performance assessments of models in places where these
models are expected to have low performance or on time-horizons
which are not practically useful. In order for a study to contribute
significantly to our shared body of knowledge, authors are strongly
encouraged to report forecast performances using a larger set of
statistical indicators of accuracy, thus providing a more complete
perspective on the models’ potential. Usage of the traditional indi-
cators MBE and RMSE , preferably normalized to mean values, still
is  mandatory.  But,  additional  statistical  error  measures,  like  the
Kolmogorov-Smirnoff Integral [212] or the quality metric proposed
in [52] , are highly recommended. This would help program man-
agers of funding agencies and policy makers in taking appropriate
decisions.

Appendix A. Radiometric parameters used in this study

Solar  resource  is  quantified  by  several  physical  quantities,

briefly described here (see Fig. A1 for angles definition):
- G n [W/m 2 ] – Direct-normal irradiance (DNI), the density of the
solar energy flux incoming from the solid angle subtended by
the Sun’s disc, on a unitary surface normal to the rays.

138

R. Blaga et al. / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 70 (2019) 119–144

- G

d [W/m 2 ] – Diffuse irradiance represents the density of the so-
lar energy flux incoming on a horizontal surface from the entire
sky hemisphere, excluding the Sun’s disc.

- G [W/m 2 ] – Global horizontal irradiance (GHI) is the sum of the

direct-horizontal and diffuse components, given by:

G = G

b + G

d = G n cos θz + G

(A2)

The  term  “global” is  associated  to  the  fact  that  solar  radiation
comes from the entire celestial vault.
- G t  [W/m 2 ]  – Total  solar  irradiance  (TSI)  received  by  a  sur-
face tilted with an angle β in respect to the horizontal plane
( Fig. A1 ) is the sum of three solar energy fluxes beam, diffuse
and reflected by ground G r :

Such  classifications  are  not  unique.  Sometimes  the  difference
between adjacent classes is very fuzzy. Therefore, the diagrams be-
low summarize the vision of the authors of this paper on the clas-
