    "question_text": "Why does the H2/CO electrochemical co-oxidation mechanism in SOFC anodes require careful modeling of competitive adsorption and surface diffusion processes?",
    "standard_answer": "H2/CO electrochemical co-oxidation in SOFC anodes requires careful modeling of competitive adsorption and surface diffusion because both species compete for the same active sites at triple phase boundaries, and their oxidation mechanisms involve different intermediate steps with varying kinetics. Hydrogen typically oxidizes directly through H2 adsorption, dissociation, and reaction with O2- ions, while CO oxidation may proceed through direct electrochemical oxidation or via the water-gas shift reaction followed by H2 oxidation. The competitive adsorption arises because both H2 and CO molecules adsorb on Ni sites, with CO having stronger adsorption affinity that can potentially poison active sites and reduce overall cell performance. Surface diffusion becomes critical because reactants must transport from gas pores to active sites, and the presence of multiple species creates diffusion limitations that affect local concentrations and current distribution. Proper modeling must account for the different electrochemical kinetics (exchange current densities, activation overpotentials), adsorption isotherms (Langmuir, Temkin), and surface coverage effects that modify the effective reaction rates. The co-oxidation behavior also depends on operating conditions - at lower temperatures, CO oxidation kinetics become sluggish, while at higher temperatures, both species contribute significantly to current generation, requiring accurate representation of their competitive and synergistic effects on overall cell performance.",

    "standard_answer": "The effective binary diffusion coefficient accounting for both molecular and Knudsen diffusion is calculated using the Bosanquet formula: 1/Deff = 1/Dmol + 1/DKn. First, the molecular diffusion coefficient for H2-H2O at 800°C (1073 K) can be estimated from Chapman-Enskog theory or standard correlations. Using the Fuller-Schettler-Giddings correlation: D12 ∝ T^1.75/P, with D12 ≈ 0.1 cm²/s at 300K, 1 atm for H2-H2O, we scale to 1073K: Dmol = 0.1 × (1073/300)^1.75 ≈ 0.1 × 12.3 ≈ 1.23 cm²/s = 1.23×10^-4 m²/s. For Knudsen diffusion: DKn = (d_pore/3)√(8RT/πM) where d_pore = 1 μm = 1×10^-6 m, R = 8.314 J/mol·K, T = 1073 K, M_H2 = 0.002 kg/mol. DKn = (1×10^-6/3)√(8×8.314×1073/(π×0.002)) = 3.33×10^-7 × √(35700) ≈ 3.33×10^-7 × 189 ≈ 6.3×10^-5 m²/s. Then combined diffusion: 1/Dcomb = 1/1.23×10^-4 + 1/6.3×10^-5 = 8130 + 15873 = 24003, so Dcomb = 4.17×10^-5 m²/s. Finally, effective coefficient in porous media: Deff = (ε/τ)Dcomb = (0.3/2.0)×4.17×10^-5 = 0.15×4.17×10^-5 = 6.26×10^-6 m²/s. This shows Knudsen diffusion significantly reduces the effective diffusivity in fine-pore electrodes.",

    "question_text": "How does radiative heat transfer couple with temperature distribution in SOFC modeling, and what are the mathematical formulations for radiosity in planar and tubular configurations?",
    "standard_answer": "Radiative heat transfer in SOFCs couples strongly with temperature distribution through the radiosity method, which accounts for energy exchange between solid surfaces (PEN, interconnector, air supply tube) and with the environment. The coupling occurs because surface radiosities depend on both local temperature (through the blackbody emission term) and the radiation arriving from other surfaces (through view factors). For the planar and tubular geometries, the radiosity BPEN at position z on the PEN surface is governed by an integral equation that includes: emission from the local surface (εPENσBTPEN^4), reflection of incoming radiation from other surfaces, and view factors that geometrically weight the contributions from all other surface elements. The mathematical formulation involves solving coupled integral equations for each surface element's radiosity, where the view factors F account for the geometric configuration and determine how much radiation from one surface element reaches another. In planar SOFCs, radiation occurs between parallel PEN and interconnector surfaces, while in tubular designs, cylindrical geometry creates more complex view factor relationships involving the air supply tube and annular flow passages. This radiation coupling significantly affects temperature gradients, particularly in high-temperature operation where radiative fluxes can be comparable to convective and conductive heat transfer.",

    "question_text": "How does the dusty gas model (DGM) account for Knudsen diffusion and pressure-driven flow in porous SOFC electrodes, and why is it superior to Fickian and Stefan-Maxwell models in predicting concentration overpotential?",
    "standard_answer": "The dusty gas model (DGM) treats the porous solid matrix as an additional stationary 'dust' species with large molecular weight, enabling it to capture three transport mechanisms simultaneously: molecular diffusion, Knudsen diffusion, and viscous (pressure-driven) flow. Knudsen diffusion becomes significant when pore sizes are comparable to the gas mean free path, where gas-wall collisions dominate over intermolecular collisions. The DGM incorporates Knudsen diffusion through the Knudsen diffusion coefficient Di,K and accounts for pressure gradients that develop due to non-equimolar fluxes in multicomponent systems. This is particularly important in SOFC electrodes where electrochemical reactions create stoichiometrically determined flux ratios that violate the equimolar counter-diffusion assumption. The DGM's superiority over Fickian and Stefan-Maxwell models lies in its ability to correctly predict the concentration overpotential by accurately capturing the species concentration profiles at the triple phase boundaries. Fickian models underestimate concentration gradients in concentrated systems and poorly handle Knudsen effects, while Stefan-Maxwell models without proper Knudsen corrections fail to account for pore-gas interactions and pressure-driven flow components that significantly affect species transport in fine-pore electrodes.",

    "question_text": "How does the steam-to-methane ratio influence the reaction order with respect to steam in methane steam reforming kinetics on Ni-based catalysts, and what empirical evidence supports this relationship?",
    "standard_answer": "The reaction order with respect to steam in methane steam reforming on Ni-based catalysts exhibits a strong dependence on the H2O/CH4 ratio. Experimental studies have shown that the steam reaction order transitions from positive to negative as the steam-to-methane ratio increases. At low H2O/CH4 ratios (much less than 2), steam is necessary for the reaction and shows a positive reaction order. As the ratio approaches the stoichiometric value of approximately 2, the reaction order becomes zero as competing effects balance. When the H2O/CH4 ratio becomes significantly greater than 2, the reaction order becomes negative, typically in the range of -0.35 to -0.8. This behavior has been observed across different Ni-based catalyst formulations, with specific studies showing first-order dependency with respect to methane (m = 0.85-1.4) and slightly negative-order dependency with respect to steam (n = -0.35 to -0.8) under high steam-to-methane conditions. The empirical evidence clearly demonstrates that the reaction order of steam is dominated by the H2O/CH4 ratio, with the transition occurring around the stoichiometric ratio of 2.",
