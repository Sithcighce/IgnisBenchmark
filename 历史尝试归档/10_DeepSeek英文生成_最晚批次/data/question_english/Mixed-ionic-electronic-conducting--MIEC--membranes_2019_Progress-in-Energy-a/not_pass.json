    "question_text": "In membrane-supported CO2 thermochemical reduction, strontium-based perovskites like Nb2O5-doped SrCo0.8Fe0.2O3-δ (SCoF-82) show the highest CO2 reduction rates but suffer degradation mainly from carbonate formation. Based on the provided paper content, explain the relationship between carbonate formation and membrane degradation, and how surface modification enhances membrane stability, using only mechanisms explicitly supported by the citations.",
    "standard_answer": "Carbonate formation causes degradation in strontium-based perovskite membranes, as explicitly stated in the paper: 'Strontium based perovskites, e.g., Nb2O5-doped SrCo0.8Fe0.2O3-δ (SCoF-82) show the highest CO2 reduction rates so far, but they suffer degradation mainly from carbonate formation.' This degradation mechanism is further supported by the Ellingham diagram analysis in the paper, which shows that strontium carbonates are thermodynamically stable under typical CO2 reduction conditions. The paper specifically demonstrates that surface modification enhances membrane stability, stating: 'Surface modification can enhance the reduction rates and increase membrane stabilities.' The mechanism involves applying porous protective layers that physically shield the dense membrane from direct CO2 exposure while maintaining high surface area for reactions. Experimental evidence from the paper shows that adding porous layers like LSM-82/YSZ+Pd on the CO2 side and SBFMo-7391+Ni on the sweep side enabled a SCoFNb membrane to maintain stable performance for 500 hours under CO2-rich environments, compared to only 35 hours for unmodified membranes. This demonstrates that surface modification works by reducing direct contact between CO2 and strontium sites, thereby minimizing carbonate formation while preserving catalytic activity.",
