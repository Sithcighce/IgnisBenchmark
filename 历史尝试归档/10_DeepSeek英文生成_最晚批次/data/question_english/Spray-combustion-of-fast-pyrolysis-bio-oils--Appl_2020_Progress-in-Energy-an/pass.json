    "question_text": "Quantitatively, how does the stoichiometric air-to-fuel ratio (AFR) of FPBO compare to conventional diesel, and what implications does this have for combustor air supply systems and emission control?",
    "standard_answer": "FPBO has a stoichiometric AFR of approximately 5–6 on a mass basis, roughly half that of diesel fuel (∼14.5). This reduction arises from FPBO's high oxygen content (30–40 wt.% dry), which supplies intrinsic oxidizer, reducing the external air required for complete combustion. The lower AFR means that for the same energy output, FPBO requires about 10–20% more combustion air by mass compared to diesel, due to its lower heating value (16–19 MJ/kg vs. 42–45 MJ/kg for diesel). Specifically, the volumetric air flow rate increases because LHV_FPBO/LHV_diesel ≈ 0.4, while AFR_FPBO/AFR_diesel ≈ 0.4, resulting in a higher air demand per unit energy. Combustors must be modified to provide increased air supply and enhanced mixing to avoid fuel-rich zones that elevate CO and UHC emissions. Staged combustion can leverage the lower AFR to create initial fuel-rich zones that convert fuel-bound nitrogen to N2 rather than NOx, reducing emissions. However, the higher air flow rates may increase pressure drops and require larger compressors or blowers, impacting system design and efficiency.",

    "question_text": "How does the high water content of fast pyrolysis bio-oil (FPBO) affect its spray combustion characteristics, particularly regarding ignition delay, flame stability, and pollutant formation?",
    "standard_answer": "The high water content (15–30 wt.%) in FPBO significantly impacts spray combustion through multiple mechanisms. First, water's high latent heat of vaporization (approximately 2257 kJ/kg) and specific heat capacity absorb substantial energy during droplet heating, delaying vaporization and increasing ignition delay times. This reduces local flame temperatures, slowing chemical reaction rates and potentially causing flame instability if vaporization is incomplete within the combustor residence time. Second, the reduced flame temperature suppresses thermal NOx formation via the Zeldovich mechanism, as NOx production is exponentially temperature-dependent. However, the lower temperatures can also promote incomplete combustion, increasing CO and unburned hydrocarbon emissions if mixing is inadequate. Third, water content increases FPBO's surface tension (36 mN/m at 25°C versus 28 mN/m for light fuel oils), hindering atomization by resisting droplet breakup, which further impairs fuel-air mixing. Paradoxically, water content reduces viscosity and aging rates, slightly mitigating some combustion challenges but overall demanding higher atomization energy and optimized combustor designs to maintain efficiency.",
    "original_text": {
      "1": "The higher water content of FPBO compared to fossil oils leads to combustion/flame instabilities because it results in a lower energy density, delayed/poorer ignition from slow vaporization and reduced flame temperatures and combustion rates due to the high heat capacity and high latent heat of vaporization of water.",

    "question_text": "How do char particles and alkali metals in fast pyrolysis bio-oil (FPBO) promote aging reactions, and what is the role of rapid heating in reducing char formation during combustion?",
    "standard_answer": "Char particles in FPBO, particularly those containing alkali metals like potassium on their surfaces, act as catalysts that significantly accelerate polymerization aging reactions. These reactions transform low molecular weight compounds into high molecular weight species, increasing the fuel's viscosity and solids content over time, which degrades atomization and combustion performance. During combustion, the non-volatile residue from FPBO contributes to char formation, but this can be minimized through rapid heating. When small droplets of pyrolysis oil are heated very quickly through the 100–350 °C temperature range, significantly less char is formed—only about one quarter compared to slower heating rates. This occurs because higher heating rates favor molecular cracking reactions over polymerization reactions, and the reduced time available for polymerization limits solid residue development. Proper atomization that creates small droplets enables these high heating rates, collectively improving combustion efficiency by addressing both fuel stability through reduced aging catalysis and combustion performance through minimized char formation.",

    "standard_answer": "FPBO's high viscosity directly impairs atomization quality by increasing resistance to droplet formation and breakup during spray processes. Higher viscosity fuels require more energy to overcome cohesive forces, resulting in larger droplet sizes and poorer spray distribution. The paper states: 'FPBO is considered to be a high viscosity fuel, especially compared to transport-grade fuels, such as diesel or gasoline.' Preheating reduces viscosity and improves atomization, but must be carefully managed due to FPBO's chemical instability. The aging process, where low molecular weight compounds react to form high molecular weight compounds through polymerization, accelerates with temperature. As noted in the paper: 'Temperature is the dominant parameter which determines the rate of aging (occurring rapidly above 80°C)... and thus to prevent or reduce aging related reactions from taking place, FPBO must be stored at low temperatures.' This creates a critical trade-off: while preheating reduces viscosity for better atomization, temperatures above 80°C significantly accelerate aging reactions that increase viscosity over time and can lead to nozzle clogging and fuel degradation. Therefore, preheating strategies must balance the immediate viscosity reduction benefits against the long-term thermal degradation risks, typically requiring careful temperature control below 80°C and minimizing residence time in heated systems.",

    "standard_answer": "FPBO's unfavorable properties compared to fossil oils create significant challenges for spray combustion through several interconnected mechanisms. The high water content (15-30 wt.%) leads to combustion/flame instabilities because it results in lower energy density, delayed/poorer ignition from slow vaporization, and reduced flame temperatures due to water's high heat capacity and latent heat of vaporization. The high viscosity and elevated surface tension adversely affect atomization quality, requiring more energy for proper droplet formation. FPBO is a complex mixture of over 300 components with wide range of molecular weights and boiling temperatures, necessitating consideration of multicomponent evaporation behavior. The suspended solids content causes clogging, erosion, and deposition issues that affect nozzle longevity and combustor reliability. Additionally, FPBO's chemical instability and aging characteristics mean its properties change over time, further complicating combustion predictability. These combined properties demand combustion strategies that account for multiphase flow behavior, complex evaporation patterns, and chemical kinetics that differ significantly from conventional fossil fuel combustion processes.",
