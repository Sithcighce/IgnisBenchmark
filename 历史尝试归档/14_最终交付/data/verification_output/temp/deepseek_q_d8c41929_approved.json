  "question_text": "According to the provided paper, how are droplet-wall interaction regimes classified in SCR systems, and what specific thermal regimes are identified for heated targets? Explain the classification framework and the role of thermal mechanisms in droplet behavior.",
  "standard_answer": "The paper classifies droplet-wall interaction regimes into two main categories: thermal and hydrodynamic regimes. This classification framework provides a systematic approach to understanding droplet behavior during impingement on surfaces in SCR systems. For non-heated, dry impingement targets, the outcome is governed by hydrodynamic regimes, which include deposition, splash, and rebound based on the kinetic energy of the impacting droplets. In the case of heated targets, thermal interaction regimes become significant in addition to hydrodynamic effects. The paper specifically identifies breakup and rebound as thermal regimes. Breakup describes the disintegration of the droplet primarily driven by thermal mechanisms, such as boiling or vaporization effects, which can lead to droplet fragmentation. Rebound, in this thermal context, refers to the reflection of the entire droplet from the heated surface, influenced by factors like vapor layer formation. These thermal regimes are critical in SCR systems because they affect liquid-wall contact, heat transfer efficiency, and the potential for deposit formation, ultimately impacting ammonia preparation and NOx reduction performance. The interplay between thermal and hydrodynamic regimes determines whether droplets deposit, splash, or rebound, with thermal mechanisms like breakup enhancing secondary atomization but also posing risks for incomplete evaporation and solid by-product formation.",

    "1": "Classification of droplet impact generally comprises thermal and hydrodynamic interaction regimes as indicated in Fig. 14.",
    "2": "In case of heated targets, thermal interaction regimes, such as Breakup and Rebound, are considered in addition to hydrodynamics. Here, breakup describes a disintegration of the droplet by dominant thermal mechanisms."

It correctly identifies the two main categories (thermal and hydrodynamic regimes), properly describes the thermal regimes for heated targets (breakup and rebound), and accurately explains that breakup involves disintegration by dominant thermal mechanisms.
