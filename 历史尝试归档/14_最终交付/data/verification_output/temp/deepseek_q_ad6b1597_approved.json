  "question_text": "In high-temperature PEMFCs (HT-PEMFCs), how does the balance between CO production from the reverse water-gas shift reaction and CO electro-oxidation determine cell degradation, and what role does humidity play in reducing anodic overpotential through OH_ads species?",
  "standard_answer": "HT-PEMFCs exhibit distinct CO poisoning behavior due to competing reaction pathways that determine cell degradation. The reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction (CO₂ + H₂ → CO + H₂O) becomes significant at elevated temperatures, continuously generating CO from CO₂ impurities present in the fuel stream. Due to the endothermic nature of the RWGS, the production of CO is increased at higher temperatures. Simultaneously, increasing temperature also favors CO electro-oxidation, where adsorbed CO is oxidized to CO₂. The degradation of cells is determined by the ratio: CO_production/CO_electro-oxidation, with HT-PEMFCs being particularly sensitive to this balance. When electro-oxidation dominates, CO tolerance improves. Humidity plays a critical role in this system - in high-temperature PEMFCs, an increase in the humidity reduces the anodic overpotential. This is due to the presence of the OH_ads groups, which are consumed in the oxidation of CO. The availability of water promotes the formation of these hydroxyl species that facilitate CO removal through electrochemical oxidation pathways, thereby mitigating poisoning effects and maintaining cell performance.",

    "1": "Due to the endothermic nature of the RWGS, the production of CO is increased at higher temperatures. As incrementing the temperature also favours the CO electro-oxidation, the degradation of cells is determined by the ratio: CO_production/CO_electro-oxidation, HT-PEMFCs are particularly sensitive to this.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately reflects all key points from the original text. It correctly explains: (1) the RWGS reaction (CO₂ + H₂ → CO + H₂O) and its endothermic nature leading to increased CO production at higher temperatures, (2) the competing CO electro-oxidation process that also increases with temperature, (3) the critical CO_production/CO_electro-oxidation ratio determining cell degradation in HT-PEMFCs, and (4) the role of humidity in reducing anodic overpotential through OH_ads species that facilitate CO oxidation. The answer provides appropriate context and elaboration (e.g., mentioning CO₂ impurities in fuel stream, explaining the mechanism of OH_ads consumption) that is consistent with combustion science principles and does not contradict the original text. All cause-effect relationships are correctly stated, and the thermodynamic principles are sound.",
