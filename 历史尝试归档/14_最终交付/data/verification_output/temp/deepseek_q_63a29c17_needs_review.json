  "question_text": "Based on the provided paper content, explain how the different thermal behaviors of organically-associated REY versus REY phosphates during coal combustion affect their partitioning between fly ash and bottom ash. Include specific mechanisms supported by the paper's content.",
  "standard_answer": "The paper indicates that organically-associated REY and REY phosphates exhibit fundamentally different thermal behaviors during coal combustion that significantly impact their partitioning. Organically-associated REY in low-rank coal are 'bound with carbon functional groups (e.g. -COOH and OH) or form organometallics' and decompose as organic matter volatilizes during combustion. This releases REY ions that can become mobile. In contrast, REY phosphates are described as having 'high melting, boiling, and thermal decomposition temperature,' making them refractory minerals that largely resist decomposition. The paper summarizes that 'thermal behavior and transformation of various REY forms in coal during combustion process, including organic-associated REY, REY phosphates, REY carbonates, clay-bound REY and among others were summarized.' Two retention mechanisms are proposed: 'the incorporation of the individual REY phases into the glass as inclusions and the diffusion of REY phases throughout Si-Al glass structures in the melting process.' Consequently, organically-associated REY exhibit higher mobility and are more likely to be transported with fine particles to fly ash, while refractory REY phosphates tend to remain in coarser bottom ash fractions due to their thermal stability and resistance to volatilization.",
