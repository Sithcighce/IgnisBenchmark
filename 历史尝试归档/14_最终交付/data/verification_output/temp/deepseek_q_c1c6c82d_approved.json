  "question_text": "How does hydrogen enrichment in swirl combustors lead to flame flashback, and what role does the near-wall velocity profile play in enabling upstream flame propagation according to the provided paper?",
  "standard_answer": "Hydrogen enrichment significantly increases flame reactivity, making the fuel-air mixture so reactive that the flame may not remain confined to the combustion chamber and instead propagates upstream. In swirl combustors specifically, the flame can exploit the low velocity regions near the walls to creep upstream into the fuel-air mixing chamber. This upstream migration is problematic because premixing chambers are typically not designed to withstand high-temperature gases, making them vulnerable to damage from flashback events. The combination of hydrogen's enhanced reactivity and the favorable velocity conditions in boundary layer regions creates conditions conducive to flashback, representing a critical stability challenge in hydrogen-enriched combustion systems.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "Hydrogen use has a negative impact on the stability properties of the flame. In particular, the fuel-air mixture can be so reactive that the flame may not remain in the combustion chamber but instead, propagate upstream.",
    "2": "In swirl combustors, for example, the flame can take advantage of the low near-wall velocity to creep upstream into the fuel-air mixing chamber. The premixing chamber is typically not designed to support the presence of high-temperature gases and can be damaged because of the flashback."
