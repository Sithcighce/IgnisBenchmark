  "question_text": "In non-thermal plasma methane coupling, how does the reduced electric field (E/N) control electron energy distribution and influence methane fragmentation pathways? Using the provided paper, explain the quantitative relationship between E/N values and the resulting fragmentation patterns, including how specific E/N values shift the dominant radical formation.",
  "standard_answer": "The reduced electric field (E/N) directly governs electron energy distribution in non-thermal plasma by controlling electron acceleration in the electric field relative to gas density. Higher E/N values increase mean electron energy, which shifts methane fragmentation pathways toward more endothermic dissociation channels. According to the paper's simulation results, at E/N = 80 Td (corresponding to methane's breakdown field), fragmentation into methyl radicals reaches maximum at approximately 60%. As E/N increases up to 500 Td, the methane fragmentation pattern shifts from CH3 radicals toward CH2, CH, and atomic carbon formation. This shift occurs because higher E/N values produce electrons with sufficient energy to overcome the threshold energies for more extensive fragmentation pathways. The electron energy distribution function determines collision probabilities with methane molecules, with electron impact reactions dominating the dissociation process rather than three-body recombination. The quantitative relationship shows that methyl radical formation is optimized at lower E/N values, while higher E/N promotes more complete fragmentation through stepwise dehydrogenation pathways.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "The electron energy is controlled by the reduced electric field strength, E/N. It is defined by the electric field (E, V cm⁻¹) divided by the gas number density (N, cm⁻³).",
    "2": "From a simulated fragmentation pattern as a function of external electric field, the author showed that fragmentation into methyl radicals is maximum (60%) at an electric field of 80 Td, which corresponds to the breakdown field of methane. As the electric field increased (up to 500 Td), methane fragmentation pattern shifted from CH3 radicals to CH2, CH and C, affecting the final product distribution."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately reflects all key information from the original text. It correctly explains that E/N controls electron energy distribution, states the maximum methyl radical formation (60%) at 80 Td (methane's breakdown field), and describes the shift toward CH2, CH, and C formation as E/N increases to 500 Td. The answer provides additional context about electron acceleration, endothermic dissociation channels, collision probabilities, and stepwise dehydrogenation pathways - all of which are scientifically sound elaborations consistent with plasma physics principles. No factual errors or contradictions with the original text were found.",

        "reasoning": "The answer aligns with the ground truth: it correctly states that E/N controls electron energy, cites the 80 Td value where CH3 formation peaks at ~60%, and notes the shift toward CH2, CH, and C as E/N increases to 500 Td. The causal explanation (higher E/N increases mean electron energy enabling deeper fragmentation) is physically sound. Added context about EEDF and electron-impact dominance is reasonable and does not contradict the original text.",
