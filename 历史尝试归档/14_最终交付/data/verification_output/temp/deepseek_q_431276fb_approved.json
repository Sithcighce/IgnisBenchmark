  "question_text": "How do energy management strategies for connected HEVs and PHEVs utilize V2I communication to enable eco-driving and coordinate velocity control with power split optimization across different vehicle scenarios, and what general mechanisms support fuel economy improvements according to the provided paper?",
  "standard_answer": "Energy management strategies for connected HEVs and PHEVs leverage V2I communication to enable eco-driving by optimizing velocity profiles using traffic signal information, which is then integrated with power split optimization to enhance fuel economy. The paper emphasizes that 'With the available information from GPS, ITS (V2V/V2I), the velocity can be optimized in an economic manner (e.g., Eco-driving), in order to reduce fuel consumption.' This velocity optimization is fused with powertrain energy management, where the predicted velocity profile enables more efficient power distribution between the engine and electric motor. The coordination operates through hierarchical control frameworks where eco-driving provides optimal velocity trajectories that avoid unnecessary stops and maintain efficient speeds, while energy management controllers use this information to optimize power allocation. The paper notes that 'Eco-driving for connected vehicles using V2I communication is emphasized as well,' indicating this integration is a key focus area. For multi-vehicle scenarios, the paper states 'The objective of EMS in a multi-vehicle scenario is to investigate the EMS for each vehicle by coordinating the velocity control and power split, resulting in improvements of the overall performance (mobility and fuel economy).' This coordination reduces fuel consumption by minimizing energy losses from frequent acceleration and deceleration, optimizing engine operating points, and leveraging regenerative braking opportunities more effectively through the synergistic combination of velocity optimization and power split control.",
