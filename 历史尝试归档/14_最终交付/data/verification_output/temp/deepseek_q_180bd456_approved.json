  "question_text": "How do microstructured reactors enhance heat and mass transfer in catalytic ammonia decomposition compared to conventional reactors, and what specific advantages do they offer for hydrogen production applications?",
  "standard_answer": "Microstructured reactors significantly improve catalytic ammonia decomposition performance through enhanced transport phenomena resulting from their high surface-to-volume ratios. The small characteristic dimensions drastically reduce diffusion path lengths, enabling rapid mass transfer of reactants to catalytic surfaces and products away from active sites. This minimizes concentration gradients and prevents pore diffusion limitations that affect conventional reactors. Thermally, the thin walls and close catalyst packing enable efficient heat transfer to the endothermic decomposition reaction, maintaining favorable thermal conditions. The structured flow patterns in microchannels provide uniform flow distribution and absence of backmixing, eliminating channeling issues common in conventional reactors. These transport advantages allow microstructured reactors to achieve higher conversion efficiency while maintaining compact reactor volumes suitable for distributed hydrogen production. The enhanced heat and mass transfer characteristics make them particularly valuable for overcoming hydrogen inhibition effects and improving catalyst utilization in ammonia decomposition systems.",

It correctly identifies: (1) high surface-to-volume ratios enabling enhanced heat and mass transfer, (2) minimization of H2 inhibition, (3) uniform flow distribution and absence of backmixing in microchannels, and (4) enhanced conversion efficiency. The answer provides mechanistic explanations (reduced diffusion path lengths, thin walls for heat transfer, structured flow patterns) that are consistent with fundamental transport phenomena principles and the original text's claims. The discussion of endothermic reaction characteristics, pore diffusion limitations, and catalyst utilization represents valid elaboration on the mechanisms underlying the advantages stated in the original text.
