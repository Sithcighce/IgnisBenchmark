  "question_text": "How do coordination number and bond strength of metal nodes in MOFs influence their thermal and hydrothermal stability for post-combustion CO₂ capture applications, and what are the underlying physical mechanisms?",
  "standard_answer": "The thermal and hydrothermal stability of MOFs for post-combustion CO₂ capture is fundamentally governed by the coordination number and bond strength between metal nodes and organic linkers. Higher coordination numbers provide greater structural rigidity by distributing stress more effectively across the framework, resisting thermal degradation. The bond strength directly determines the energy required to break node-linker bonds, with stronger bonds requiring more energy for framework disintegration. Hydrothermal stability is enhanced by strong bonds that resist hydrolysis under steam exposure, as water molecules can coordinate to metal sites and cleave coordination bonds. The underlying mechanisms involve the distribution of thermal stresses across multiple coordination sites and the resistance to water attack through robust metal-oxygen bonds. MOFs with trivalent or tetravalent metal centers typically exhibit higher coordination numbers and bond strengths compared to divalent metals, making them more suitable for harsh post-combustion conditions where thermal cycling and moisture exposure are common.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "Generally, the thermal stability of MOF is related to the strength of the bond between node and linker and the number of linkers bonded to each node. Hence, the higher the node-linker bond strength and the greater the number of linkers connected to each node results in higher thermal stability of the MOF.",
    "2": "The hydrothermal stabilities of MOFs are strongly dependent upon the node-linker bond strength of MOF. Those having a high heat of formation of the node-linker bond are more hydrothermally stable as compared to low heat of formation of the node-linker bond."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately reflects the information in the original text and applies sound physical principles. It correctly states that: (1) higher coordination numbers provide structural rigidity and distribute stress effectively, (2) stronger bonds require more energy for framework disintegration, (3) hydrothermal stability depends on bond strength and resistance to hydrolysis, and (4) trivalent/tetravalent metals typically show higher coordination numbers and bond strengths than divalent metals. The answer appropriately elaborates on the mechanisms (stress distribution, water attack resistance) which are logical extensions of the principles stated in the original text. The connection between heat of formation and hydrothermal stability mentioned in the original text is correctly represented through the discussion of bond strength. No factual errors or logical contradictions are present.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer matches the ground truth: thermal stability increases with stronger node–linker bonds and a higher number of linkers per node; hydrothermal stability is primarily governed by node–linker bond strength/heat of formation. The added mechanisms (stress distribution, resistance to hydrolysis, water attack at metal sites) are physically reasonable and consistent. The general trend that higher-valent metals (e.g., Zr4+, Al3+) often yield higher coordination numbers and stronger bonds is broadly correct and does not contradict the provided text.",
