  "question_text": "Based on the provided paper, what are the proposed theories explaining increased NOx emissions in biodiesel combustion, and how does cetane number relate to ignition delay in fuels containing compounds with low-temperature reactivity?",
  "standard_answer": "The paper identifies several proposed theories for increased NOx emissions in biodiesel combustion, stating that 'Higher combustion temperature, ignition delay, oxygen content, and radiative heat loss are the most proposed theories to explain the increased emitted NOx pollutant of biodiesel combustion.' These are presented as theoretical explanations rather than established facts, with the paper noting that 'the impact of using biodiesel as diesel additive on NOx emission is largely controversial for there is no general agreement among the experimental results reported in the literature.' Regarding cetane number and ignition delay, the paper explains that 'fuels containing higher amounts of compounds with low temperature reactivity and heat release have shorter ignition delays or in better words ignite earlier as they have higher cetane numbers than fuels containing lower amounts of compounds with low-temperature reactivity.' This relationship between cetane number and ignition delay is presented as a general principle applicable to various fuels, including those with oxygenated compounds that exhibit different low-temperature reactivity characteristics.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately represents the information from the original text. It correctly quotes the four proposed theories for increased NOx emissions (higher combustion temperature, ignition delay, oxygen content, and radiative heat loss) and appropriately characterizes them as 'proposed theories' rather than established facts. The answer also accurately conveys the controversial nature of NOx emissions from biodiesel. Regarding cetane number and ignition delay, the answer correctly explains the inverse relationship: fuels with higher amounts of compounds with low-temperature reactivity have higher cetane numbers and shorter ignition delays. The answer provides appropriate context by noting this is a 'general principle applicable to various fuels.' All statements are factually accurate, logically consistent, and faithful to the original text.",
