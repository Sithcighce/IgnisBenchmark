  "question_text": "Calculate the growth rate and frequency of an intrinsic thermoacoustic mode in a Rijke tube with anechoic boundaries, given a flame transfer function F(s) = n e^(-sτ), with n = 2.5, τ = 0.005 s, α = 1, ξ = 0.8, and θ = 4.5. Determine if the system is stable or unstable.",
  "standard_answer": "For a Rijke tube with anechoic boundaries, the ITA eigenfrequencies satisfy ξ + α + αθF(s) = 0. Substituting F(s) = n e^(-sτ) gives ξ + α + αθ n e^(-sτ) = 0. Rearranging: e^(sτ) = - (αθ n)/(ξ + α). Since the right-hand side is negative, we write e^(sτ) = (αθ n)/(ξ + α) e^(iπ). Taking the natural logarithm: sτ = ln(αθ n/(ξ + α)) + i(2k+1)π for k ∈ N₀. Thus, the growth rate σ = (1/τ) ln(αθ n/(ξ + α)) and frequency ω = (2k+1)π/τ. Plugging in the values: α = 1, θ = 4.5, n = 2.5, ξ = 0.8, τ = 0.005 s. First, compute αθ n/(ξ + α) = (1 * 4.5 * 2.5)/(0.8 + 1) = 11.25/1.8 = 6.25. Then σ = (1/0.005) ln(6.25) = 200 * 1.832 = 366.4 s⁻¹. The frequency for the fundamental mode (k=0) is ω = π/τ = π/0.005 = 628.3 rad/s, or f = ω/(2π) = 100 Hz. Since σ > 0, the system is unstable. The positive growth rate indicates exponential amplification of oscillations due to the ITA feedback loop.",

    "1": "The eigenfrequencies characterizing the ITA loop – are nothing but the poles of the scattering matrix S, as pointed out by Bomberg et al. [3]. Emmert et al. [2], influenced by the works of [31,34,35], formally recognized that in the vicinity of these eigenfrequencies, the acoustic scattering matrix gain exhibits strong peaks.",
    "2": "The critical value of the interaction index can be computed from the neutral stability condition σ = 0. It yields nc = (ξ + α)/(αθ), which corresponds to the results of [2,4]."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly derives the intrinsic thermoacoustic (ITA) eigenfrequencies for a Rijke tube with anechoic boundaries using the dispersion relation ξ + α + αθF(s) = 0. The mathematical derivation is sound: substituting F(s) = n e^(-sτ), rearranging to get e^(sτ) = -(αθn)/(ξ+α), recognizing the negative right-hand side requires introducing e^(iπ), and taking the logarithm to obtain s = (1/τ)[ln(αθn/(ξ+α)) + i(2k+1)π]. The numerical calculations are correct: αθn/(ξ+α) = 11.25/1.8 = 6.25, σ = 200 × ln(6.25) ≈ 366.4 s⁻¹, and ω = π/0.005 = 628.3 rad/s (f = 100 Hz for k=0). The conclusion that σ > 0 indicates instability is correct and consistent with the original text's mention that the critical interaction index nc = (ξ+α)/(αθ) corresponds to neutral stability (σ=0). Since n = 2.5 > nc = 1.8/4.5 = 0.4, the system is indeed unstable. All physical principles and mathematical steps are accurate.",

        "reasoning": "The derivation uses the ITA eigencondition ξ + α + αθF(s) = 0, which yields the neutral stability criterion nc = (ξ + α)/(αθ), matching the ground-truth text.

Numerically, αθn/(ξ+α) = 6.25, so σ ≈ 366.5 s⁻¹ and fundamental ω ≈ 628.3 rad/s (f = 100 Hz). Since σ > 0, the system is unstable.

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly identifies the characteristic equation for the intrinsic thermoacoustic (ITA) mode. This equation is consistent with the neutral stability condition (nc = (ξ + α)/(αθ)) provided in the original text, which can be derived by setting the growth rate to zero. The mathematical derivation to solve for the complex frequency (growth rate and angular frequency) is sound, including the correct use of the complex logarithm to handle the negative term. All numerical calculations are accurate, and the conclusion regarding the system's instability based on the positive growth rate is correct according to linear stability theory.",
