  "question_text": "How does the transition from kinetic to diffusion-limited heterogeneous reaction during particle ignition affect the thermal structure and propagation mechanism of flames in solid fuel suspensions?",
  "standard_answer": "The transition from kinetic to diffusion-limited heterogeneous reaction fundamentally alters the flame structure and propagation mechanism. Initially, in the kinetic regime, particle ignition is controlled by surface reaction kinetics and is highly sensitive to local temperature and oxidizer concentration. As particles heat up in the flame preheat zone, they transition to diffusion-limited combustion where the reaction rate is governed by oxidizer transport to the particle surface. This transition creates a 'flame-inside-the-flame' structure where each burning particle acts as an independent heat source. The thermal structure becomes distributed rather than continuous, with heat release occurring discretely at particle locations. This distributed combustion front enables flame propagation through sequential ignition of downstream particles by conductive and radiative heat transfer from already-burning particles. The diffusion-limited regime ensures that once ignited, particles burn rapidly and completely, maintaining high local temperatures that sustain the flame propagation. This mechanism explains why heterogeneous flames can propagate efficiently even when individual particle ignition temperatures are high, as the collective heat release from burning particles creates conditions favorable for igniting subsequent particles.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately describes the transition from kinetic to diffusion-limited heterogeneous reaction and its effects on flame structure and propagation. It correctly explains: (1) the kinetic regime being controlled by surface reaction kinetics and temperature/oxidizer sensitivity, (2) the transition to diffusion-limited combustion governed by oxidizer transport, (3) the 'flame-inside-the-flame' structure mentioned in the original text, (4) distributed rather than continuous thermal structure with discrete heat release at particle locations, and (5) the propagation mechanism through sequential ignition via conductive and radiative heat transfer. The answer is consistent with the original text's key points about particle self-heating, the transition process, and the flame-inside-the-flame structure being central to heterogeneous flame peculiarities. All physical principles stated (Arrhenius kinetics, diffusion-limited combustion, heat transfer mechanisms) are correct. The answer is detailed but contains no factual errors or logical contradictions.",
