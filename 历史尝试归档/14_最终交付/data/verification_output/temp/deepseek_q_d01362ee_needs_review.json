  "question_text": "Why does ammonia exhibit significantly lower laminar burning velocity compared to conventional hydrocarbons, and what molecular properties and reaction kinetics cause this behavior?",
  "standard_answer": "Ammonia's low laminar burning velocity stems from its unique molecular structure and reaction kinetics. The strong N-H bonds (BDE ≈ 435 kJ/mol) require substantial energy for hydrogen abstraction, making the initial decomposition steps highly endothermic. The primary initiation reaction NH3 → NH2 + H has an activation energy of ~460 kJ/mol, significantly higher than C-H bond cleavage in hydrocarbons (~420 kJ/mol for methane). Furthermore, the ammonia oxidation mechanism involves multiple slow intermediate steps: NH2 radicals predominantly react through NH2 + NO → N2 + H2O rather than chain-branching pathways, and the NH + O2 → HNO + O reaction has a high activation barrier. The system also suffers from radical termination through reactions like NH2 + NH2 → N2H4, which consumes reactive radicals without producing chain carriers. Additionally, ammonia's high nitrogen content leads to significant heat sink effects as energy is consumed in breaking strong N≡N bonds (941 kJ/mol) during N2 formation. The combined effect of high bond dissociation energies, slow radical production rates, and efficient termination pathways results in laminar burning velocities typically 5-7 times lower than methane under similar conditions.",

The formation of the strong N≡N bond (941 kJ/mol) is a highly exothermic process that releases a significant amount of energy.

While the high stability of N2 is a thermodynamic driver, the statement misrepresents its role as a 'heat sink' during its formation."

It correctly identifies most of the key kinetic reasons for ammonia's low burning velocity (high N-H BDE, slow initiation, termination pathways), which are consistent with the original text. However, the claim that forming N2 acts as a heat sink by breaking N≡N bonds is fundamentally incorrect and reverses the thermodynamic principle. Energy is released, not consumed, when the stable N2 molecule is formed.",
