  "question_text": "Why does the ideal selectivity of gas pairs like H₂/CO₂ increase with temperature, while selectivity for pairs like O₂/N₂ or CO₂/CH4 decreases? Explain the competing effects of diffusivity and solubility selectivity.",
  "standard_answer": "The temperature dependence of ideal selectivity (α_A/B = P_A/P_B) arises from the relative changes in diffusivity and solubility selectivities. Diffusivity selectivity (D_A/D_B) generally decreases with temperature because the activation energy for diffusion (E_D) is higher for larger molecules; thus, heating disproportionately increases the diffusivity of larger penetrants, reducing the diffusivity advantage of smaller gases. Solubility selectivity (S_A/S_B) depends on the condensability difference: for pairs where the larger gas is more condensable (e.g., CO₂ over H₂), heating reduces the solubility of the condensable gas more sharply (ΔH_s < 0), increasing solubility selectivity. For H₂/CO₂, H₂ is smaller and less condensable, so diffusivity selectivity decreases slightly, but solubility selectivity increases significantly because CO₂ solubility drops with temperature. This net increase in solubility selectivity outweighs the diffusivity loss, raising overall H₂/CO₂ selectivity. Conversely, for O₂/N₂ or CO₂/CH4, both gases have similar condensability, and the smaller gas (O₂ or CO₂) is also more condensable, so both diffusivity and solubility selectivities decrease with temperature, leading to reduced overall selectivity.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "In the case of H2/CO2 separation, however, a significant decrease in the solubility of more condensable gas with temperature causes a substantial increase in solubility selectivity that consequently offsets the decreasing diffusivity selectivity.",
    "2": "When one component is smaller, and at the same time, more soluble than the other one (e.g., O2 over N2 or CO2 over CH4), both solubility and diffusivity selectivities decrease as temperature increases."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly explains the temperature dependence of ideal selectivity for different gas pairs. It accurately describes: (1) diffusivity selectivity generally decreases with temperature because larger molecules have higher activation energies for diffusion; (2) for H₂/CO₂, solubility selectivity increases with temperature as CO₂ (more condensable) loses solubility faster than H₂, offsetting the diffusivity decrease - consistent with original text [1]; (3) for O₂/N₂ or CO₂/CH₄ pairs where the smaller gas is also more condensable, both selectivities decrease with temperature - consistent with original text [2]. The physical principles (activation energy for diffusion, condensability effects on solubility, ΔH_s < 0 for condensable gases) are correctly stated. The cause-effect relationships are sound and the explanation is logically consistent throughout.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly explains the competing effects of diffusivity and solubility selectivity on overall gas separation selectivity as a function of temperature. It accurately states that for H₂/CO₂, the strong increase in solubility selectivity (due to the sharp drop in condensable CO₂ solubility) outweighs the decrease in diffusivity selectivity. For pairs like O₂/N₂ and CO₂/CH₄, it correctly identifies that both diffusivity and solubility selectivities decrease with temperature because the smaller, faster-diffusing gas is also the more soluble one.
