  "question_text": "How are local catalytic reaction rates determined from transverse species measurements in confined channel flows, and what is the relationship between the catalytic reaction rate and the transverse fuel gradient at the wall?",
  "standard_answer": "Local catalytic reaction rates in confined channel flows are determined through non-intrusive laser-based measurements of transverse species concentration profiles, particularly using spontaneous Raman spectroscopy. The catalytic molar reaction rate of the fuel, ̇s_F, is directly proportional to the transverse fuel gradient at the catalytic wall according to the relationship: (ρD_F ∂Y_F/∂y)_w = W_F ̇s_F. This fundamental equation shows that the fuel mass flux at the wall equals the catalytic reaction rate multiplied by the fuel's molecular weight. The normalized wall gradient (1/Y_F,IN)Y'_F,w serves as a direct measure of local catalytic activity since it is proportional to the catalytic reaction rate. This methodology requires spatially-resolved measurements across the channel height to capture the boundary layer profiles, which exhibit significant stratification with fuel concentration decreasing toward the catalytic wall due to heterogeneous reactions. The measurements are typically performed at conditions where the catalytic Damköhler number is below the ignition threshold to ensure the reaction rate changes appreciably with Damköhler number variations, allowing for meaningful kinetic investigations.",

    "1": "The catalytic molar reaction rate of the fuel, ̇s_F, is hence: ̇s_F = B_s (ρY_F/W_F)_w exp(-E_s/RT_w).",
    "2": "The local wall gradient is proportional to the catalytic reaction rate: (ρD_F ∂Y_F/∂y)_w = W_F ̇s_F, such that the normalized gradient of the fuel is also proportional to the catalytic reaction rate."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly explains the methodology for determining local catalytic reaction rates using transverse species measurements. It accurately states the fundamental relationship (ρD_F ∂Y_F/∂y)_w = W_F ̇s_F from the original text, correctly identifying that fuel mass flux at the wall equals the catalytic reaction rate multiplied by molecular weight. The answer also correctly notes that the normalized wall gradient is proportional to catalytic reaction rate, consistent with the original text. While the answer provides additional context about measurement techniques (spontaneous Raman spectroscopy), boundary layer profiles, and operating conditions (catalytic Damköhler number below ignition threshold), these elaborations are reasonable and do not contradict the original text. The core physical principles and mathematical relationships are accurately presented.",

It also notes that a normalized wall gradient tracks catalytic activity, consistent with the ground truth.
