  "question_text": "Explain how combustion temperature affects the volatilization-condensation mechanism of trace elements in coal fly ash formation, and analyze how this mechanism influences the distribution of Group II elements across different particle sizes according to the provided paper.",
  "standard_answer": "Combustion temperature plays a critical role in the volatilization-condensation mechanism during coal fly ash formation. At high combustion temperatures (typically between 400°C and 1500°C), mineral elements undergo phase transformations where certain elements volatilize and subsequently condense onto finer fly ash particles as the flue gases cool. This mechanism creates distinct enrichment patterns based on element classification. According to the volatilization-condensation theory, Group II elements (As, Cd, Mu, Pb, Sb, and Se), defined as 'chalcophiles', display increasing concentration with decreasing particle size due to their volatilization behavior at combustion temperatures and subsequent condensation onto the surfaces of smaller fly ash particles. In contrast, Group I elements (Al, Ca, Fe, K, Mg, Na, and Ti), classified as 'lithophiles', show little or no enrichment in smaller particles, while Group III elements (Be, Cu, Ni, V, and Co) exhibit intermediate behavior with some enrichment in smaller particles but to a lesser extent than Group II elements. The combustion temperature directly affects the extent of mineral element volatilization, with higher temperatures promoting greater enrichment of these volatile elements on smaller particles through this condensation mechanism.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "Volatilization-condensation theory distinguishes three groups of elements [151,152]: Group I elements (Al, Ca, Fe, K, Mg, Na, and Ti), which are classified as 'lithophiles', show little or no enrichment in smaller fly ash particles; Group II elements (As, Cd, Mu, Pb, Sb, and Se) are defined as 'chalcophiles' and display increasing concentration with decreasing particle size; and, finally, Group III elements (Be, Cu, Ni, V, and Co) exhibit intermediate behaviour, being enriched in smaller particles but to a lesser extent than elements in Group II.",
    "2": "For coal fly ash, many literature studies have focused on the mechanism that determines the large amount of inorganic compounds and toxic elements that vaporize and condense onto fly ash particles during combustion at high temperatures (400 °C–1500 °C)."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately explains the volatilization-condensation mechanism and its relationship to combustion temperature. It correctly identifies the three groups of elements and their behavior patterns as stated in the original text: Group I (lithophiles) show little/no enrichment in smaller particles, Group II (chalcophiles) display increasing concentration with decreasing particle size, and Group III exhibits intermediate behavior. The temperature range (400°C-1500°C) is correctly cited. The answer correctly explains that high combustion temperatures cause volatilization of certain elements which then condense onto finer particles as flue gases cool, creating the observed enrichment patterns. All factual statements align with the original text, and the logical flow from combustion temperature to volatilization to condensation to particle size distribution is sound. The answer is detailed but contains no errors.",

        "reasoning": "The answer aligns with the provided text: it correctly links high combustion temperatures (400–1500 °C) to volatilization and subsequent condensation onto fly ash and accurately describes the particle-size enrichment trends for the element groups. Specifically, it correctly states that Group II elements show increasing concentration with decreasing particle size, while Group I shows little/no enrichment and Group III shows intermediate behavior. The causal link between higher temperature and increased volatilization is a reasonable elaboration consistent with the mechanism and does not contradict the source.",
