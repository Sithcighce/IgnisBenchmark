  "question_text": "Calculate the combined uncertainty in laminar flame speed prediction due to three dominant reactions with sensitivity coefficients S1=0.3, S2=0.2, S3=0.1 and respective rate uncertainties of 20%, 25%, and 40%, assuming independent log-normal distributions.",
  "standard_answer": "For independent log-normal uncertainties, the combined relative uncertainty in the model prediction can be calculated using error propagation through the sensitivity coefficients. The contribution from each reaction is given by (S_i × δx_i/x_i), where δx_i/x_i is the relative uncertainty in the rate coefficient. For reaction 1: contribution = 0.3 × 0.20 = 0.06; for reaction 2: contribution = 0.2 × 0.25 = 0.05; for reaction 3: contribution = 0.1 × 0.40 = 0.04. Since the uncertainties are independent and log-normal, the total variance is the sum of squares of individual contributions: σ²_total = (0.06)² + (0.05)² + (0.04)² = 0.0036 + 0.0025 + 0.0016 = 0.0077. The standard deviation is σ_total = √0.0077 ≈ 0.0877, meaning the combined uncertainty in the laminar flame speed prediction is approximately 8.77%. This calculation demonstrates how even moderate uncertainties in multiple sensitive reactions can combine to produce significant overall prediction uncertainty. The result assumes first-order approximation and independent parameters, which is reasonable for most combustion applications where the dominant sensitive reactions are often chemically distinct.",

    "1": "The product of the first-order sensitivity coefficient and the uncertainty in the rate coefficient measures of the influence of the uncertainty in an individual rate parameter on the uncertainty in a kinetic model prediction.",
    "2": "For example, if a particular combustion response has a logarithmic sensitivity coefficient of 0.2 with respect to k1—a value typical for the laminar flame speed—the uncertainty of k1 causes the predicted combustion response to be uncertain by ±3% due to this uncertainty alone."

          "The standard answer incorrectly applies the uncertainty propagation formula. According to the original text, a sensitivity coefficient of 0.2 with a 15% uncertainty (0.15) gives ±3% uncertainty in the prediction (0.2 × 0.15 = 0.03). This implies direct multiplication, not sum of squares.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer applies an incorrect uncertainty propagation method. The original text clearly demonstrates that for a sensitivity of 0.2 and uncertainty factor that produces ±3%, the relationship is direct multiplication (S × δk/k). For log-normal distributions with logarithmic sensitivity coefficients, the uncertainties combine additively in log-space, not through sum of squares.
