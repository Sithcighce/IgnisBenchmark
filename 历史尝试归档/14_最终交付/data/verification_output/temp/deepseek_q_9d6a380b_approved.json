  "question_text": "How does the Biot number classification distinguish between thermally thin and thermally thick particles in biomass combustion, and what are the implications for intra-particle temperature gradients and conversion stages?",
  "standard_answer": "The Biot number (Bi = h_eff * d / λ) distinguishes thermally thin (Bi < 0.1) from thermally thick (Bi > 0.1) particles based on the ratio of internal to external heat transfer resistance. For thermally thick particles, significant intra-particle temperature gradients exist due to limited internal conduction relative to surface convection/radiation, leading to simultaneous drying, devolatilization, and char conversion stages occurring at different radial positions. In contrast, thermally thin particles exhibit uniform temperature, resulting in sequential conversion stages. This gradient in thermally thick particles necessitates modeling intra-particle transport phenomena, as varying temperatures affect reaction rates, product yields, and overall conversion times. The characteristic length (d) and thermal conductivity (λ) are critical, with larger particles or lower conductivity exacerbating gradients, impacting heat and mass transfer during combustion.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "The Biot number is defined as Bi = h_eff d / λ, where the thermal conductivity (λ), characteristic length (d) and effective heat transfer coefficient (h_eff) are used.",
    "2": "For low Biot numbers (< 0.1), a thermally thin regime is present, whereas large Biot numbers (> 0.1) indicate the presence of a thermally thick regime."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly defines the Biot number (Bi = h_eff * d / λ) and accurately distinguishes between thermally thin (Bi < 0.1) and thermally thick (Bi > 0.1) particles, consistent with the original text. The physical interpretation is sound: thermally thick particles have significant intra-particle temperature gradients due to limited internal conduction relative to external heat transfer, while thermally thin particles have uniform temperature. The explanation of simultaneous vs. sequential conversion stages follows logically from these temperature profiles. The discussion of how characteristic length and thermal conductivity affect gradients is physically correct. While the answer is more detailed than the original text, all statements are accurate and represent valid extensions of the core concepts without contradicting established combustion science principles.",

It accurately explains that high Bi leads to significant intra-particle temperature gradients and spatially overlapping conversion stages, while low Bi implies near-uniform temperature and temporally ordered stages.
