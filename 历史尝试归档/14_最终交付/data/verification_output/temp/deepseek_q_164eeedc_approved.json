  "question_text": "How does the adsorption geometry of furfural on metal surfaces influence selectivity in biomass upgrading reactions, and what role do surface composition and coverage play in controlling reaction pathways?",
  "standard_answer": "The adsorption geometry of furfural on metal surfaces critically determines selectivity in biomass upgrading by controlling which functional groups interact with active sites. On non-oxophilic metals like Ni(111) and Pt(111), furfural adsorbs in a flat orientation with the furan ring parallel to the surface, enabling strong ring-surface interactions that favor decarbonylation to furan. In contrast, when oxophilic metals such as Fe are added to Ni(111) surfaces, furfural adopts a tilted adsorption configuration where the furan ring is no longer bound to the surface. This tilted geometry suppresses ring chemistry pathways like decarbonylation and ring hydrogenation by preventing ring-surface interactions, instead promoting alternative reaction pathways. Surface coverage also influences adsorption geometry - high hydrogen coverage on Pt surfaces forces furfural into tilted configurations by reducing available surface sites, shifting selectivity from decarbonylation to hydrogenation. These geometric effects demonstrate how manipulating surface composition and coverage can direct reaction pathways by selectively exposing different functional groups to catalytic sites.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "HREEL spectra reveal that FAL adsorbs in a flat orientation on surfaces which are selective for decarbonylation to furan, e.g., Ni(111) and Pt(111); the same is true of oxygenated aromatics such as benzaldehyde.",
    "2": "The addition of an oxophilic metal, i.e., Fe, to a Ni(111) surface causes FAL to adsorb in a tilted configuration with the furan ring no longer bound to the surface, rendering ring chemistry, i.e., decarbonylation or ring hydrogenation, less likely."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately reflects the information from the original text and extends it logically. Key facts verified: (1) Flat adsorption on Ni(111) and Pt(111) favors decarbonylation to furan - consistent with original text [1]. (2) Addition of oxophilic Fe to Ni(111) causes tilted configuration preventing ring-surface interactions and suppressing ring chemistry - directly matches original text [2]. (3) The answer correctly identifies the causal relationship between adsorption geometry and selectivity. The additional discussion about hydrogen coverage effects on Pt surfaces, while not explicitly in the provided excerpts, represents a reasonable extension of the geometric control principle and does not contradict the original text. The mechanistic explanations are scientifically sound and logically consistent with surface chemistry principles.",

        "reasoning": "The answer accurately reflects the ground truth: flat adsorption of furfural on Ni(111)/Pt(111) correlates with decarbonylation to furan, while adding oxophilic Fe to Ni(111) induces a tilted geometry that suppresses ring chemistry (decarbonylation and ring hydrogenation). It correctly links adsorption geometry to selectivity and composition effects. The added point about hydrogen coverage influencing geometry/selectivity is an extrapolation beyond the provided text but does not conflict with it.",
