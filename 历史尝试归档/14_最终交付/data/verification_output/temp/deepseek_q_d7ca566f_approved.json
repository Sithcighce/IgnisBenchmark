  "question_text": "Calculate the effective diffusion coefficient for a gas species in dry wood with porosity 0.6, tortuosity 2.5, constriction factor 1.2, and binary diffusion coefficient 1e-5 m²/s. How does this value impact species transport compared to free diffusion?",
  "standard_answer": "The effective diffusion coefficient is calculated as D_eff = (ε * s_c * D) / τ, where ε is porosity (0.6), s_c is constriction factor (1.2), D is binary diffusion coefficient (1e-5 m²/s), and τ is tortuosity (2.5). Substituting values: D_eff = (0.6 * 1.2 * 1e-5) / 2.5 = (7.2e-6) / 2.5 = 2.88e-6 m²/s. This value is approximately 29% of the binary diffusion coefficient, indicating significantly reduced species transport due to the porous wood structure. The reduction arises from longer diffusion paths (tortuosity) and pore constrictions, slowing down mass transfer of volatiles and gases. In combustion modeling, this lower D_eff emphasizes the importance of convective transport via Darcy's law and can lead to higher intra-particle concentrations, affecting reaction rates and product yields.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "It is suggested by Fogler that it can be related to the binary diffusion coefficient, D, such that D_eff = (ε_g s_c D) / τ, where τ is tortuosity, s_c is a constriction factor and ε_g is the volume fraction occupied by the gas phase, which is equal to the porosity in the case of dry wood.",
    "2": "In some works, diffusion of the gas species is neglected, since it is assumed that it is much smaller compared to convection."

        "reasoning": "The answer correctly applies the formula D_eff = (ε * s_c * D) / τ from the original text, with accurate substitution of values: (0.6 * 1.2 * 1e-5) / 2.5 = 2.88e-6 m²/s. The calculation is mathematically correct. The interpretation that this represents ~29% of the binary diffusion coefficient (2.88e-6 / 1e-5 ≈ 0.288) is accurate. The physical explanation of reduced transport due to tortuosity and constriction is sound and consistent with the original text. The discussion of implications for combustion modeling, including the importance of convective transport and effects on intra-particle concentrations, is a reasonable extension that doesn't contradict the original text. The reference to Darcy's law for convective transport and the note from the original text that diffusion is sometimes neglected compared to convection further supports the answer's discussion. No factual errors or logical inconsistencies detected.",
