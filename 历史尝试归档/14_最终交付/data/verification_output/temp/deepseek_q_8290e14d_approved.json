  "standard_answer": "Bubble growth in water electrolysis occurs in three distinct stages, each governed by different physical forces and characterized by specific mathematical relationships for bubble radius (r) as a function of time (t). In the first stage, internal pressure and surface tension forces dominate, leading to a linear growth relationship: r(t) = A·t, where A is a growth coefficient. This stage involves the initial expansion driven by gas accumulation against surface tension. In the second stage, growth is controlled by the flux of dissolved gas from the liquid phase to the bubble interface, resulting in a diffusion-limited growth described by r(t) = A·t^(1/2). This parabolic growth occurs because gas transport is rate-limited by concentration gradients. In the third stage, growth is governed by the electrochemical reaction rate or direct gas injection into the bubble, leading to r(t) = A·t^(1/3). This cubic root dependence arises from the reaction kinetics becoming the limiting factor, where gas production rate directly influences bubble expansion. These stages reflect transitions from surface tension dominance to diffusion control and finally to reaction rate limitation, impacting overall electrolysis performance due to bubble coverage effects.",

    "1": "Three bubble growth stages are involved in water electrolysis. In the first stage, the internal and surface tension forces dominate the bubble growth. The growth rate of the bubble can be described by a time-dependent bubble radius r(t) = A·t, where A is the growth coefficient and t is the time.",
    "2": "In the second stage, the growth rate of the bubble is controlled by the flux rate of dissolved gas from the liquid phase to the bubble, and r(t) = A·t^(1/2). The last stage is governed by the electrochemical reaction rate or so-called direct injection of gas into the bubble and r(t) = A·t^(1/3)."
