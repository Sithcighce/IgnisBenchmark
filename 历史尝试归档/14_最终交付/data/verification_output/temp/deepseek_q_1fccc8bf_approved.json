  "standard_answer": "Detonations can propagate through unconﬁned detonable mixtures without congestion because they are self-sustaining waves comprising a tightly coupled leading shock and reaction zone. The shock compresses and heats the unreacted mixture, triggering rapid chemical reactions that release energy, which in turn sustains the shock wave. This feedback loop allows detonations to maintain high velocities (~1800 m/s) and overpressures (~18 atm) independently of external obstructions. In contrast, deﬂagrations are subsonic combustion waves where burning is driven by molecular and turbulent transport. Congestion (obstacles) is necessary to sustain overpressure in deﬂagrations because it enhances turbulence, increasing flame surface area and burning rates, which generates and maintains pressure waves. Without congestion, the flame speed decays rapidly due to lack of turbulence generation, and overpressure decreases. The paper states: 'no congestion is necessary to sustain detonation propagation through the detonable mixture. In contrast to the case of a detonation, congestion is required to sustain the overpressure in deﬂagrations. Outside of the congested regions, the flame speed decays quickly and, therefore, the deﬂagration overpressure decreases quickly.' This fundamental difference arises from the detonation's reliance on shock dynamics versus the deﬂagration's dependence on diffusive and turbulent processes.",

        "reasoning": "The answer correctly explains the fundamental difference between detonations and deflagrations. It accurately describes detonations as self-sustaining shock-coupled combustion waves that maintain high velocities and pressures without external obstructions, and deflagrations as subsonic combustion requiring congestion to generate turbulence and sustain overpressure. The physical principles (shock compression, chemical energy release feedback, molecular/turbulent transport, flame surface area enhancement) are all correct. The answer directly quotes and properly interprets the original text. The numerical values cited (~1800 m/s, ~18 atm) are reasonable for detonations. All cause-effect relationships are logically sound, and there are no contradictions with established combustion science or the original text.",
