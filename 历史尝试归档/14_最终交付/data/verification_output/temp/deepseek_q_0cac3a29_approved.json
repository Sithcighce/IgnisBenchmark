  "standard_answer": "The double distribution function (DDF) approach in LBM enables accurate simulation of thermal compressible flows by decoupling the evolution of translational and internal energy modes through two distribution functions: f_i for mass and momentum, and g_i for total energy. This separation allows independent control over relaxation processes, facilitating variable Prandtl numbers. The key mechanism involves a quasi-equilibrium formulation where relaxation to equilibrium occurs in two stages: a fast relaxation to an intermediate quasi-equilibrium (f_i*, g_i*) followed by a slow relaxation to the full equilibrium (f_i^eq, g_i^eq). The Prandtl number is adjusted by tuning the relaxation times τ and τ1, with Pr = (2 - δt/τ)/(2 - δt/τ1). The quasi-equilibrium g_i* modifies the first-order moment to control non-equilibrium heat flux, ensuring correct recovery of Fourier diffusion and viscous heating terms in the energy equation. For multi-species flows, additional corrections account for enthalpy flux due to species diffusion and non-linear dependence of enthalpy on composition. This approach overcomes limitations of single-distribution models, such as fixed Prandtl numbers and specific heat ratios, by leveraging kinetic theory principles to separately handle different energy modes and transport phenomena.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "The double distribution function (DDF) can be represented through the following general form of the evolution equation: ̄fi(x + ciδt, t + δt) − ̄fi(x, t) = (δt/̄τ)(f_i^eq(x, t) − ̄fi(x, t)) + (δt/̄τ1)(f_i*(x, t) − ̄fi(x, t)),",
    "2": "Setting λ = (̄τ1/δt) - 1/2 c_p p, one recovers the energy balance equation with variable Prandtl number as Pr = (2 - δt/̄τ)/(2 - δt/̄τ1)."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately describes the DDF approach in LBM for thermal compressible flows. It correctly identifies the use of two distribution functions (f_i for mass/momentum, g_i for total energy) and the quasi-equilibrium formulation with two-stage relaxation. The Prandtl number formula Pr = (2 - δt/τ)/(2 - δt/τ1) matches the original text exactly. The answer correctly explains how this decoupling enables variable Prandtl numbers through independent control of relaxation times. While the answer provides additional detail about multi-species flows and specific mechanisms not explicitly mentioned in the brief original text excerpt, these elaborations are consistent with established LBM theory and do not contradict the provided ground truth. The core mechanisms are accurately presented.",

It reproduces the correct Pr relation Pr = (2 - δt/τ)/(2 - δt/τ1) and aligns with the ground-truth form involving relaxation to equilibrium and quasi-equilibrium.

        "reasoning": "The standard answer is factually and logically correct. It accurately explains the core principle of the Double Distribution Function (DDF) approach, which is the decoupling of momentum and energy transport via two separate distribution functions (f_i and g_i). This allows for independent relaxation times, which in turn enables the tuning of the Prandtl number. The answer correctly cites the relationship between the Prandtl number and the two relaxation times (τ and τ1), which is consistent with the provided original text. Furthermore, the explanation of the quasi-equilibrium state's role in recovering the correct energy equation terms (like viscous heating) is a key aspect of advanced thermal LBM and is stated correctly.",
