  "question_text": "Why does reverse RCCI combustion configuration reduce hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions compared to conventional RCCI at low loads?",
  "standard_answer": "Reverse RCCI (R-RCCI) reduces HC and CO emissions through improved combustion efficiency and reduced charge cooling effects. In conventional RCCI, a significant portion of premixed low reactivity fuel becomes trapped in squish volumes and crevice regions where temperatures remain too low for complete oxidation. The high volatility of gasoline-like fuels in these regions creates substantial charge cooling that further suppresses combustion. R-RCCI addresses this by premixing only a small quantity of high reactivity fuel while directly injecting the low reactivity fuel. This strategy minimizes fuel trapping in cold boundary layers since the premixed HRF has higher oxidation tendency and the DI LRF achieves better vaporization and mixing. The reduced charge cooling from lesser premixed fuel quantity allows higher local temperatures for complete combustion. Additionally, the reverse reactivity stratification maintains controlled combustion phasing while ensuring more fuel burns in optimal temperature regions, significantly improving combustion efficiency and reducing unburned hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "In R-RCCI combustion mode, a relatively smaller quantity of HRF than conventional RCCI is premixed, resulting in lesser fuel trapped in the squish and crevice regions.",
    "2": "The higher oxidization tendency of the trapped premixed HRF is another important aspect of the R-RCCI combustion mode, enhancing the combustion efficiency."
