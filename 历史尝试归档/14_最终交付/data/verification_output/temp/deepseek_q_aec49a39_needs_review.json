  "question_text": "Calculate the theoretical maximum hydrogen yield from steam gasification of cellulose (C6H10O5) considering complete conversion via the reactions: C6H10O5 + 6H2O → 6CO + 11H2 and CO + H2O → CO2 + H2, and determine the steam-to-biomass ratio required for stoichiometric hydrogen production.",
  "standard_answer": "For cellulose (C6H10O5) with molecular weight 162 g/mol, the complete steam gasification follows: C6H10O5 + 6H2O → 6CO + 11H2. This produces 11 moles H2 per mole cellulose. The water-gas shift reaction: CO + H2O → CO2 + H2 converts each CO to additional H2. Combining both reactions: C6H10O5 + 12H2O → 6CO2 + 17H2. Thus, maximum H2 yield = 17 moles H2 per mole cellulose = 17 mol × 2 g/mol = 34 g H2 per 162 g cellulose = 0.21 g H2/g biomass or 210 g H2/kg biomass. The stoichiometric steam requirement is 12 moles H2O per mole cellulose. Steam mass = 12 mol × 18 g/mol = 216 g. Biomass mass = 162 g. Therefore, steam-to-biomass ratio (S/B) = 216/162 = 1.33 kg steam/kg biomass. In practice, higher S/B ratios (1.5-2.0) are used to drive the equilibrium toward hydrogen production and prevent carbon deposition. The theoretical hydrogen energy content is 34 g H2 × 120 MJ/kg H2 = 4.08 MJ per kg cellulose, representing the maximum possible hydrogen energy yield from complete steam gasification.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer provides a comprehensive and accurate analysis of hydrogen production from cellulose steam gasification. The chemical equations are correctly balanced: C6H10O5 + 6H2O → 6CO + 11H2 for initial gasification, and CO + H2O → CO2 + H2 for water-gas shift. The combined reaction C6H10O5 + 12H2O → 6CO2 + 17H2 is correctly derived. All calculations are accurate: molecular weight of cellulose (162 g/mol), hydrogen yield (17 mol × 2 g/mol = 34 g per 162 g cellulose = 0.21 g H2/g biomass), steam requirement (12 mol × 18 g/mol = 216 g), and steam-to-biomass ratio (216/162 = 1.33). The energy calculation (34 g × 120 MJ/kg = 4.08 MJ/kg cellulose) is correct. The answer is consistent with the original text regarding steam gasification producing H2-rich syngas and S/B ratio being a critical operational variable. The mention of practical S/B ratios (1.5-2.0) and reasons for using higher ratios (driving equilibrium, preventing carbon deposition) represents sound engineering knowledge that doesn't contradict the original text. All thermodynamic and chemical principles are correctly applied.",
