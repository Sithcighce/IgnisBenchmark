  "question_text": "How do collisional-broadening coefficients vary with temperature and perturber composition in combustion gases, and what physical interactions govern their species-specific dependencies?",
  "standard_answer": "Collisional-broadening coefficients γ_k for a given absorber depend on the perturber species k, temperature T, and the quantum states involved. The temperature dependence is typically modeled as γ_k(T) = γ_k(T_0) (T_0/T)^n_γ, where n_γ is the temperature exponent. Physically, γ_k arises from intermolecular forces during collisions: stronger interactions (e.g., dipole-dipole, dipole-induced dipole, dispersion forces) increase broadening. For H2O broadened by N2, γ is smaller than for H2O broadened by CO2 due to CO2's larger quadrupole moment enhancing interaction strength. The exponent n_γ reflects how collision cross-sections change with temperature; for hard-sphere collisions, n_γ ≈ 0.5, but real molecules exhibit deviations due to potential energy surfaces. In multi-component gases, the total broadening is Δν_C = 2P ∑x_k γ_k(T), requiring knowledge of all γ_k. High temperatures activate more rotational states, altering averaged γ_k values. Databases like HITRAN provide γ_k and n_γ, but extrapolation beyond fitted ranges can cause errors. In combustion, where gas composition varies (e.g., CO2, H2O, N2, O2), accurate lineshape modeling must account for these dependencies to prevent biases in temperature and concentration retrievals, especially at elevated pressures where collisional broadening dominates.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly explains collisional-broadening coefficients and their dependencies. Key points verified: (1) Temperature dependence formula γ_k(T) = γ_k(T_0)(T_0/T)^n_γ matches original text exactly. (2) Total broadening formula Δν_C = 2P ∑x_k γ_k(T) is correctly stated. (3) Physical mechanisms (intermolecular forces, dipole-dipole interactions, dispersion forces) are accurately described. (4) Species-specific examples (H2O-N2 vs H2O-CO2) demonstrate correct understanding of interaction strength effects. (5) Temperature exponent discussion (n_γ ≈ 0.5 for hard-sphere) is physically sound. (6) Multi-component gas treatment and combustion applications are correctly explained. The answer is detailed but contains no factual errors or logical contradictions. All statements are consistent with established spectroscopy and combustion science principles.",
