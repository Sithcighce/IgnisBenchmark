  "question_text": "Calculate the percentage increase in decomposition heat release for HMX when catalyzed by nano PbSnO3, given the baseline HMX heat release is 1350 J·g⁻¹ and the catalyzed value is 1573 J·g⁻¹. Based on the paper's findings, explain how nano additives generally enhance combustion efficiency in solid propellants through their effects on thermal properties and reaction mechanisms.",
  "standard_answer": "The percentage increase in decomposition heat release is calculated as: [(1573 - 1350) / 1350] × 100 = 16.52%. This 223 J·g⁻¹ increase represents enhanced energy conversion efficiency during HMX decomposition. According to the paper, nano-sized additives like PbSnO3 enhance combustion efficiency through multiple mechanisms: they increase decomposition rates and burning rates by changing thermal conductivity, lowering the energy barrier of thermolysis, increasing heat of reaction, and modifying gas-phase reaction mechanisms. The extremely large specific surface areas of nano additives provide significant catalytic effects in both condensed and gas phases during decomposition and combustion, activating reactants and accelerating their transition state formations. These additives could increase both the decomposition and the burning rate as well as enhance the combustion efficiency of the corresponding solid propellants by changing the thermal conductivity, energy barrier of thermolysis, heat of reaction, and gas-phase reaction mechanisms of the main ingredients such as RDX, HMX, and AP. The enhanced heat release directly contributes to improved propellant performance in rocket propulsion applications where specific impulse depends on combustion temperature and completeness of energy release.",

        "reasoning": "The answer correctly calculates the percentage increase as 16.52% using the formula [(1573-1350)/1350]×100. The calculation is accurate (223/1350 = 0.1652 or 16.52%). The explanation of how nano additives enhance combustion efficiency accurately reflects the original text, correctly citing the mechanisms: changing thermal conductivity, lowering energy barrier of thermolysis, increasing heat of reaction, and modifying gas-phase reaction mechanisms. The answer appropriately mentions the large specific surface areas of nano additives and their catalytic effects in both condensed and gas phases. The additional context about rocket propulsion applications, while not in the original text, is scientifically sound and represents reasonable elaboration rather than error. All physical principles stated are correct, and there are no contradictions with the original text.",
