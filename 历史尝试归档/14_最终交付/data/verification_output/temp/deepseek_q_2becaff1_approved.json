  "question_text": "Using the distributed model for SS-AD, derive the partial differential equation for the concentration change of soluble substrates along the vertical direction of the reactor, considering both diffusion and leachate flow.",
  "standard_answer": "The distributed model for SS-AD describes the concentration change of soluble substrates (e.g., acetate) along the vertical direction (Z) using a partial differential equation that incorporates diffusion and leachate flow. The general form is derived from mass balance principles: ∂S/∂t = D_S (∂²S/∂Z²) - q (∂S/∂Z) + Σ production terms - Σ consumption terms, where S is the soluble substrate concentration, D_S is the diffusion coefficient, q is the volumetric liquid flow rate per unit surface area, and t is time. For acetate in SS-AD, the production term includes the conversion from hydrolytic products via a stoichiometric coefficient (χ) and hydrolysis rate (k_h X f(S)), while the consumption term involves microbial uptake following Monod kinetics (ρ_max S B / (K_S + S) g(S)). Thus, the specific equation is: ∂S/∂t = D_S (∂²S/∂Z²) - q (∂S/∂Z) + χ k_h X f(S) - [ρ_max S B / (K_S + S)] g(S). This equation accounts for spatial-temporal variations, where diffusion (D_S ∂²S/∂Z²) and convection (-q ∂S/∂Z) govern mass transfer, and the reaction terms represent biochemical transformations, highlighting the interplay between transport and kinetics in heterogeneous SS-AD systems.",

    "2": "∂S/∂t = D_S (∂²S/∂Z²) - q (∂S/∂Z) + χ k_h X f(S) - [ρ_max S B / (K_S + S)] g(S), where S (g L^-1) is the concentration of the soluble substrate (acetate in this study) in the whole system; f(S) and g(S) are the inhibition functions of acetate to hydrolysis and microbial growth, respectively; Z (cm) represents the vertical coordinate of the reactor; D_S (cm^2 d^-1) is the diffusion coefficient of the soluble substrate; q (L cm^-2 d^-1) is the volumetric liquid flow rate per unit surface area; χ is the stoichiometric coefficient of different hydrolytic products to acetate; K_S (g L^-1) is the half saturation constant of acetate; ρ_max (d^-1) is the maximum acetate utilization rate."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately derives and explains the partial differential equation for soluble substrate concentration in SS-AD systems. It correctly presents the equation ∂S/∂t = D_S (∂²S/∂Z²) - q (∂S/∂Z) + χ k_h X f(S) - [ρ_max S B / (K_S + S)] g(S), which matches the original text exactly. The answer properly identifies all terms: diffusion (D_S ∂²S/∂Z²), convection (-q ∂S/∂Z), production (χ k_h X f(S)), and consumption (ρ_max S B / (K_S + S) g(S)). The physical interpretation is sound, correctly explaining that the equation accounts for spatial-temporal variations through mass balance principles, with diffusion and convection governing mass transfer while reaction terms represent biochemical transformations. All variable definitions and their roles are consistent with the original text. The answer is detailed but contains no factual errors or logical contradictions.",
