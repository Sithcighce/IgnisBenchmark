  "question_text": "Why does the presence of oxygen in the feed gas enhance CO₂ permeation flux in mixed electronic, oxide-ionic, and carbonate-ionic conductor (MEOCC) membranes, and how do the relative conductivities of electrons and oxide ions modulate this effect?",
  "standard_answer": "In MEOCC membranes, oxygen in the feed gas enhances CO₂ permeation flux by providing an alternative charge compensation pathway via electron conduction, which can dominate over oxide-ion conduction depending on the material's conductivity ratios. The permeation chemistry involves CO₂ ionization to CO₃²⁻, which is charge-compensated by either electrons (e⁻) or oxide ions (O²⁻). When O₂ is present, it facilitates the reaction CO₂ + 1/2O₂ + 2e⁻ → CO₃²⁻, increasing the driving force for CO₂ transport. The flux equation for MEOCC membranes shows that J_CO₂ depends on the sum of electronic (σ_e⁻) and oxide-ionic (σ_O²⁻) conductivities. If σ_e⁻ is high (>1 S cm⁻¹), increasing σ_O²⁻ has a diminishing or negative effect because electron transport becomes the preferred pathway, and additional O²⁻ flux may counter CO₃²⁻ transport. Conversely, at low σ_e⁻ (≤0.1 S cm⁻¹), higher σ_O²⁻ significantly boosts flux by enabling efficient charge balance. For example, in membranes with dominant electronic conductivity, O₂ presence shifts the permeation mechanism toward MECC-like behavior, where CO₂ flux is proportional to (p_CO₂ * p_O₂^(1/2)), exploiting both CO₂ and O₂ partial pressures for enhanced performance. This interplay ensures that MEOCC membranes adapt to feed compositions, optimizing flux through dynamic charge carrier selection.",

    "1": "For MEOCC membranes shown in Fig. 2c, CO₃²⁻ charge compensation mechanisms depend on feed-gas composition. If there is O₂ in the feed side, the following equation is adequate to calculate J_CO₂.",
    "2": "J_CO₂ can be enhanced by the presence of oxygen in feed side, increasing electronic conductivity of solid matrix, increasing oxide-ionic conductivity at a low electronic conductivity (≤0.1 S cm⁻¹); while J_CO₂ decreases with increasing oxide-ionic conductivity at a high electronic conductivity (>1 S cm⁻¹)."
