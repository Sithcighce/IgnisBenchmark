  "question_text": "How do heat losses to electrodes influence laminar MIE (MIEL) and why does electrode thickness (dth) and spark gap (dgap) play critical roles?",
  "standard_answer": "Heat losses to electrodes significantly increase MIEL by dissipating energy from the spark kernel through conduction. Thicker electrodes (larger dth) have higher thermal mass and conductivity, enhancing heat sink effects and raising MIEL. For example, MIEL increases from 2 mJ at dth = 1-2 mm to 20 mJ at dth = 5 mm for methane-air mixtures. Similarly, smaller spark gaps (dgap) reduce the distance for conductive heat transfer, intensifying losses. At dgap = 0.5 mm, up to 90% of spark energy can be lost to electrodes, causing kernel quenching. The critical flame radius must exceed both the quenching distance and the thermal penetration depth into electrodes for successful ignition. Thus, optimal dgap balances reduced heat loss against practical constraints, while minimal dth minimizes parasitic cooling, directly linking electrode geometry to ignition efficiency through fundamental heat transfer principles.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "At dth = 5 mm, the value of Eig(50%) can be as high as 20 mJ, showing a significant increase of heat losses to the thick electrodes [61].",
    "2": "Heywood and co-workers [58] applied a constant Eig = 2.8 mJ at a fixed τp = 100 μs to estimate the ratio of energy loss to energy supplied using three different values of dgap = 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mm. As shown in Fig. 12, they found that about 90% of the ignition energy supplied was lost at the case of dgap = 0.5 mm, resulting in a quench of the initial kernel (No Go)."

          "The answer states 'MIEL increases from 2 mJ at dth = 1-2 mm to 20 mJ at dth = 5 mm for methane-air mixtures' but the original text only states that at dth = 5 mm, Eig(50%) can be as high as 20 mJ. There is no mention of 2 mJ at dth = 1-2 mm in the original text, making this a fabricated comparison.",
          "The answer attributes the 90% energy loss figure to dgap = 0.5 mm correctly, but the original text specifies this was for a 'constant Eig = 2.8 mJ at a fixed τp = 100 μs' - these specific experimental conditions are not mentioned in the answer, which could be misleading about the generality of the 90% figure."
        ],
        "reasoning": "The answer contains a factual error by creating a specific numerical comparison (2 mJ at dth = 1-2 mm) that does not appear in the original text. While the original text does mention 20 mJ at dth = 5 mm, it does not provide the baseline value of 2 mJ at smaller electrode thickness. This is a fabricated data point that misrepresents the original source. The rest of the answer's mechanisms and explanations are generally sound and consistent with combustion physics, but the inclusion of unsupported numerical data constitutes a factual error.",

        "reasoning": "The answer correctly states that heat losses to electrodes raise MIEL and that thicker electrodes and smaller gaps intensify losses. It accurately reflects the ground-truth findings: ~20 mJ at dth = 5 mm and ~90% energy loss at dgap = 0.5 mm leading to quenching. Minor issues are limited to terminology (conductivity), an unverified numeric example for thinner electrodes, and a non-standard statement about critical radius, but these do not undermine the core correctness.",
