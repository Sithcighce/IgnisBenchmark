  "question_text": "How do zeolite pore structure and acidity distribution affect product selectivity in catalytic plastic pyrolysis, and what mechanisms explain the differences between ZSM-5 and Y zeolites?",
  "standard_answer": "Zeolite pore structure and acidity distribution fundamentally control product selectivity in catalytic plastic pyrolysis through shape selectivity and reaction pathway modulation. ZSM-5, with its medium pore size (5.1-5.6 Å) and strong Brønsted acidity, favors production of lighter hydrocarbons (C2-C4 olefins) and mono-aromatics due to spatial constraints that prevent formation of larger molecules. The confined pore environment promotes cracking reactions through carbenium ion mechanisms, followed by oligomerization, cyclization, and aromatization of the smaller fragments. In contrast, Y zeolites with larger pore sizes (7.4 Å) allow access to internal acid sites for bigger hydrocarbon chains, producing heavier products (C11-C19 hydrocarbons) with higher alkane content. The mechanism difference arises from hydrogen transfer reactions: Y zeolites facilitate rapid bimolecular hydrogen transfer between carbenium ions and alkanes, yielding saturated hydrocarbons, while ZSM-5's constrained geometry limits these bimolecular reactions, favoring olefin preservation and aromatic formation through monomolecular pathways. Additionally, the stronger acid sites in ZSM-5 promote deeper cracking and aromatization, while Y zeolites' milder acidity maintains heavier hydrocarbon chains. This explains why ZSM-5 typically produces hydrocarbons no larger than C14 with high aromatic content, while Y zeolites generate C11-C19 range products dominated by alkanes/alkenes.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "It was found that lighter hydrocarbons can be generated over medium-pore zeolites, as compared to large-pore zeolites, in the order of (lighter hydrocarbons) ZSM-5 ˂ mordenite ˂ β ˂ Y ˂ Ultrastable Y (heavier hydrocarbons)",
    "2": "US-Y, Y, and β zeolites mainly produced alkanes, whereas the major products were alkenes over mordenite and ZSM-5, due to rapid bimolecular hydrogen transfer reactions"

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately explains the mechanisms of zeolite pore structure and acidity effects on catalytic plastic pyrolysis. It correctly states that ZSM-5 (medium pore, 5.1-5.6 Å) produces lighter hydrocarbons and olefins, while Y zeolites (larger pore, 7.4 Å) produce heavier hydrocarbons and alkanes. The explanation of bimolecular hydrogen transfer reactions in Y zeolites producing alkanes versus ZSM-5 favoring olefins is consistent with the original text [2]. The product distribution trends (ZSM-5 producing lighter vs Y producing heavier) align with original text [1]. The mechanistic explanations involving carbenium ions, shape selectivity, and the differences in hydrogen transfer reactions are scientifically sound and consistent with established catalytic cracking principles. While the answer is detailed, all statements are factually accurate and logically consistent.",

        ],
        "reasoning": "The answer correctly ties pore size to product selectivity (medium-pore ZSM-5 yields lighter, olefinic/aromatic products; large-pore Y/US-Y yields heavier, more alkane-rich products) and explains differences via shape selectivity and hydrogen transfer vs monomolecular pathways, consistent with the ground truth. Minor issues involve unsupported specificity in carbon-number ranges and a broad acidity-strength claim, but no core contradictions.",
