  "question_text": "Calculate the minimum number of computational samples required to estimate the probability of lean blowout in a gas turbine with 95% confidence that the estimate is within 1% of the true probability, assuming the true probability is 0.001.",
  "standard_answer": "Using binomial distribution statistics for rare event probability estimation, the required sample size N can be determined from the relative error requirement. For a rare event probability p=0.001 with relative error ε=0.01 and confidence level 95% (z=1.96 for normal approximation), the minimum samples needed is approximately N = z²(1-p)/(ε²p) = (1.96)²(0.999)/((0.01)²(0.001)) = (3.8416)(0.999)/(0.0000001) = 3.838/0.0000001 = 38,380,000 samples. This enormous number highlights the 'data-poor' nature of extreme events - even with 38 million observations, we only achieve 1% relative error for a 0.1% probability event. This calculation demonstrates why traditional Monte Carlo approaches are infeasible for combustion extreme events and why specialized rare event sampling techniques with variance reduction are essential for practical analysis of lean blowout probabilities in engineering design.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "Data-poor problems are particularly relevant when related to extreme events (also called anomalous events) that can lead to catastrophic failure of the system.",
    "2": "Rare events refer to low-probability events. There is no probability level that universally defines a rare event. Instead one can consider that an event is rare when the overall observational cost is so large that a specific procedure is required to induce this outcome."

        "reasoning": "The answer correctly applies statistical sampling theory for rare event probability estimation. The calculation uses the appropriate formula N = z²(1-p)/(ε²p) for determining sample size needed to estimate a rare event probability with specified confidence and relative error. The arithmetic is correct: (1.96)²(0.999)/((0.01)²(0.001)) ≈ 38,380,000 samples. The answer appropriately connects this to the original text's concepts of 'data-poor problems' and 'extreme events,' correctly explaining why such a large sample size demonstrates the impracticality of traditional Monte Carlo methods for rare events like lean blowout. The conclusion about needing specialized variance reduction techniques is logically sound and consistent with the original text's statement that 'an event is rare when the overall observational cost is so large that a specific procedure is required.' All physical and statistical principles are correctly stated.",
