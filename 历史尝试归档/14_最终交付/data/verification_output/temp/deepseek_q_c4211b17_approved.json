  "question_text": "How do in situ generated Brønsted acid sites (BAS) in NaY zeolite affect methyl lactate dehydration selectivity, and what spectroscopic techniques identify these sites and their role in the reaction mechanism?",
  "standard_answer": "In situ generated Brønsted acid sites (BAS) in NaY zeolite decrease methyl lactate dehydration selectivity by catalyzing side reactions such as decarbonylation to acetaldehyde and decomposition to coke. These BAS are formed through an ion exchange process between methyl lactate and Na⁺-form zeolites, generating sodium-carboxylate salts and BAS. Transmission FTIR spectroscopy identifies the in situ generated BAS through the characteristic ν(Al-O⁺H–) band in the range of ~3645–3635 cm⁻¹ and the sodium-carboxylate salt via the ν([O–C–O]⁻) stretching mode at ~1605–1570 cm⁻¹. The role of BAS in reducing dehydration selectivity is confirmed by quenching experiments: adding an alkaline species like pyridine to the methyl lactate feed titrates the BAS, evidenced by pyridinium formation, and increases dehydration selectivity by more than 20% by suppressing the side reactions catalyzed by BAS. This spectroscopic evidence directly links BAS generation to decreased selectivity, highlighting the importance of controlling BAS formation to optimize catalyst performance in biomass upgrading processes.",

    "1": "Further investigations into the origin of this mode uncovered a general ion exchange process between organic acids and Na⁺-form zeolites, generating non-volatile sodium-carboxylate salts, identified via a characteristic [O–C–O]⁻ stretching mode (ν([O–C–O]⁻) ~1605–1570 cm⁻¹), and Brønsted acid sites (BAS, ν(Al-O⁺H–) ~3645–3635 cm⁻¹).",
    "2": "Based on the spectroscopic identification of in situ generated BAS, including an alkaline species (pyridine) in the methyl lactate reactant feed to quench these sites increased dehydration selectivity by more than 20%."
