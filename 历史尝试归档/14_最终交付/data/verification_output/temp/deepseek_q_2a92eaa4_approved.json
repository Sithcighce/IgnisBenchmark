  "question_text": "What role do pore topology and diffusional limitations in zeolite catalysts play in SRO efficiency, and how do hierarchical structures mitigate these effects?",
  "standard_answer": "Zeolite pore topology significantly impacts SRO efficiency by influencing mass transport of bulky polyaromatics and products. Microporous zeolites (e.g., HZSM-5 with 0.53–0.56 nm channels) impose severe diffusional limitations on large molecules like triaromatics, reducing accessibility to active sites and increasing residence time for secondary reactions like overcracking or coke formation. Coke precursors trapped in micropores deactivate catalysts by blocking pores and acidic sites. Hierarchical zeolites introduce mesoporosity (2–50 nm) alongside micropores, enhancing diffusion pathways. For example, increasing mesoporosity from 19% to 41% in a Ru/USY catalyst improved hexadecane hydrocracking conversion by 12% and jet-fuel yields by 8% by facilitating reactant and product transport. This reduces coke deposition and improves stability. Additionally, mesopores allow better dispersion of metallic sites, optimizing hydrogenation-cracking synergy. The balance between microporosity for shape selectivity and mesoporosity for diffusion is crucial for processing heavy feeds like light cycle oil, where molecular sizes exceed micropore dimensions.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately reflects and expands upon the original text. It correctly explains that hierarchical zeolites overcome diffusional limitations by introducing mesoporosity alongside micropores. The specific data from Azkaar et al. [70] is accurately cited (19% to 41% mesoporosity increase leading to 12% conversion improvement and 8% jet-fuel yield increase in 2.5% Ru/USY catalyst for hexadecane hydrocracking). The answer provides additional context about micropore dimensions (0.53-0.56 nm for HZSM-5), diffusional limitations with bulky polyaromatics, coke formation mechanisms, and the importance of balancing microporosity for shape selectivity with mesoporosity for diffusion - all of which are consistent with established zeolite catalysis principles and do not contradict the original text. The physical and chemical principles regarding mass transport, pore blocking, and catalyst deactivation are correctly stated.",
