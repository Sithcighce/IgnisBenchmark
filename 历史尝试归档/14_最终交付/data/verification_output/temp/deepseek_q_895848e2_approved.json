  "question_text": "Calculate the permeability of CO₂ through a polyimide membrane at 150°C if its permeability at 25°C is 10 Barrer, given an activation energy for diffusion of 40 kJ/mol and an enthalpy of sorption of -15 kJ/mol. Assume the pre-exponential factors remain constant.",
  "standard_answer": "To calculate the permeability at 150°C, use the combined solution-diffusion model where permeability P = S × D. First, convert temperatures to Kelvin: T₁ = 25°C = 298 K, T₂ = 150°C = 423 K. The diffusivity D follows Arrhenius: D₂/D₁ = exp[-(E_D/R)(1/T₂ - 1/T₁)], with E_D = 40,000 J/mol, R = 8.314 J/mol·K. Thus, D₂/D₁ = exp[-(40000/8.314)(1/423 - 1/298)] = exp[-(4810.5)(0.002364 - 0.003356)] = exp[-(4810.5)(-0.000992)] = exp[4.773] ≈ 118.3. Solubility S follows van't Hoff: S₂/S₁ = exp[-(ΔH_s/R)(1/T₂ - 1/T₁)], with ΔH_s = -15,000 J/mol. So, S₂/S₁ = exp[-( -15000/8.314)(1/423 - 1/298)] = exp[(1804.5)(-0.000992)] = exp[-1.790] ≈ 0.167. Then, permeability P₂ = P₁ × (S₂/S₁) × (D₂/D₁) = 10 Barrer × 0.167 × 118.3 ≈ 197.6 Barrer. This calculation shows that despite the decrease in CO₂ solubility at higher temperature, the large increase in diffusivity dominates, resulting in a net increase in permeability.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly applies the solution-diffusion model (P = S × D) and uses the appropriate temperature-dependent relationships from the original text. The Arrhenius equation is correctly applied for diffusivity with E_D = 40 kJ/mol, and the van't Hoff relationship is correctly applied for solubility with ΔH_s = -15 kJ/mol. The mathematical calculations are accurate: D₂/D₁ ≈ 118.3 (diffusivity increases with temperature), S₂/S₁ ≈ 0.167 (solubility decreases due to negative enthalpy of sorption), and the final permeability P₂ ≈ 197.6 Barrer correctly shows the net increase. The physical interpretation that diffusivity increase dominates over solubility decrease is sound and consistent with membrane transport principles.",

Signs are handled correctly (positive activation energy increases D with T; negative sorption enthalpy decreases S with T). The temperature conversion, use of R, and numerical calculations are consistent and lead to a plausible result (~198 Barrer). No factual or logical errors detected.",
