  "question_text": "Calculate the collisional linewidth for CO in air at 10 atm and 1000 K, given a collisional broadening coefficient γ_CO-air = 0.046 cm⁻¹/atm at 296 K and a temperature exponent N = 0.75. How does this compare to the Doppler linewidth for a CO transition at 2200 cm⁻¹, and what implications does this have for lineshape modeling in high-pressure combustion systems? Consider the actual composition of air (79% N₂, 21% O₂) and justify your choice of transition frequency.",
  "standard_answer": "First, calculate the temperature-adjusted collisional broadening coefficient using γ(T) = γ(T₀) × (T₀/T)^N. With T₀ = 296 K, T = 1000 K, N = 0.75, γ_CO-air(1000 K) = 0.046 × (296/1000)^0.75 = 0.046 × (0.296)^0.75 ≈ 0.046 × 0.405 = 0.01863 cm⁻¹/atm. For air composition, we must consider both major components: N₂ (79%) and O₂ (21%). Assuming similar broadening coefficients for simplicity (γ_CO-N₂ ≈ γ_CO-O₂ ≈ γ_CO-air), the collisional linewidth ΔνC = 2P Σ χkγk = 2 × 10 atm × (0.79 × 0.01863 + 0.21 × 0.01863) = 20 × 1.00 × 0.01863 ≈ 0.3726 cm⁻¹. For Doppler linewidth, ΔνD = ν₀ √(7.1623×10⁻⁷ T/M). For CO, M = 28 g/mol, ν₀ = 2200 cm⁻¹ (typical for fundamental vibrational band), so ΔνD = 2200 × √(7.1623×10⁻⁷ × 1000 / 28) = 2200 × √(2.558×10⁻⁵) ≈ 2200 × 0.005058 = 0.1113 cm⁻¹. Comparing ΔνC ≈ 0.3726 cm⁻¹ and ΔνD ≈ 0.1113 cm⁻¹, collisional broadening dominates by approximately 3.35 times. Implications: At high pressure (10 atm), collisional broadening is significant, requiring Voigt profiles that combine Lorentzian (collisional) and Gaussian (Doppler) components. The lineshape is primarily Lorentzian-dominated, necessitating accurate temperature-dependent γ and pressure measurements. For modeling, line mixing may occur at high pressures, and laser linewidth must be much smaller than ΔνC for accurate Beer-Lambert application. In combustion systems, these factors are critical for precise species concentration and temperature measurements using laser absorption spectroscopy, particularly in engines, turbines, and industrial furnaces where pressure effects significantly alter spectral lineshapes.",

    "1": "The collisional linewidth ΔνC is a strong function of the gas pressure: ΔνC = 2P Σ χkγk(T), where Xk represents the mole fraction of every kth component within the gas mixture and γik denotes the collisional broadening coefficient of the ith absorbing species with respect to the jth component.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly applies the formulas from the original text. It properly calculates the temperature-adjusted collisional broadening coefficient using γ(T) = γ(T₀) × (T₀/T)^N, obtaining 0.01863 cm⁻¹/atm. The collisional linewidth calculation using ΔνC = 2P Σ χkγk is correctly applied with air composition (79% N₂, 21% O₂), yielding 0.3726 cm⁻¹. The Doppler linewidth calculation is performed correctly using standard formulas for CO at 2200 cm⁻¹, giving 0.1113 cm⁻¹. The comparison showing collisional broadening dominates by ~3.35 times is mathematically sound. The implications for lineshape modeling (Voigt profiles, Lorentzian-dominated behavior, line mixing at high pressure) are physically accurate and relevant to high-pressure combustion systems. All calculations follow correct physical principles and are consistent with the original text's formulas.",

          "Doppler linewidth computation is numerically incorrect: using the stated formula gives 2200 × 0.005058 ≈ 11.13 cm⁻¹, not 0.1113 cm⁻¹, indicating an internal arithmetic error.",
          "The Doppler constant/units are misapplied; the correct Doppler FWHM for CO at 1000 K and 2200 cm⁻¹ is about 0.03 cm⁻¹, not 0.111 cm⁻¹, so the answer overestimates Doppler width by ~3–4×.",
          "Because of the Doppler error, the comparison understates the dominance of collisional broadening; the collisional-to-Doppler ratio is ~12, not ~3.3.",
          "Minor: Statement that laser linewidth must be much smaller than ΔνC for accurate Beer–Lambert application is not generally required for integrated absorbance, though narrow linewidth aids lineshape-resolved techniques."
        ],
        "reasoning": "The collisional width calculation and use of ΔνC = 2 P Σ χk γk(T) with γ(T) = γ(T0)(T0/T)^N are consistent with the ground-truth relations and yield ΔνC ≈ 0.37 cm⁻¹ at 10 atm and 1000 K. However, the Doppler linewidth is substantially miscalculated: the provided arithmetic is inconsistent and the resulting value (0.111 cm⁻¹) is too large; the correct Doppler FWHM is ~0.03 cm⁻¹. Consequently, the answer underestimates how strongly the Lorentzian (collisional) component dominates. The qualitative implications (Voigt with Lorentzian dominance, potential line mixing) are reasonable, but the numerical Doppler error is a factual issue.",
