  "question_text": "Based on the provided data, explain the correct interpretation of the '50% below' statement regarding trapped vortex combustor (TVC) lean blow-out (LBO) performance compared to conventional swirl-stabilized combustors. Detail the combustion stability mechanisms that enable this enhancement, focusing specifically on the aerodynamic features described in the paper, and clarify what the paper states about the dependence of LBO limits on loading parameters without making unsupported claims about specific improvement calculations or thermal mechanisms.",
  "standard_answer": "The '50% below' statement indicates that TVC LBO limits are approximately 50% of the values for conventional combustors, meaning if a conventional combustor has an LBO equivalence ratio of φ_conv, the TVC would sustain combustion down to about 0.5 × φ_conv. This enhanced stability stems from the TVC's cavity-based design, which creates stable recirculation zones. When properly sized, these cavities form 'locked' vortices that rotate smoothly without shedding. The hot recirculation zone remains shielded from the main flow, providing continuous ignition sources even under lean conditions. The cavity geometry minimizes flow disturbances, reducing susceptibility to extinction from velocity fluctuations. The paper specifically notes that 'the TVC LBO limits do not depend strongly on the loading parameters as those for conventional combustors,' indicating greater operational robustness. This aerodynamic stability allows TVCs to operate reliably at equivalence ratios where conventional systems would experience flameout, with the cavity design providing inherent resistance to flow field disturbances that typically affect swirl-stabilized systems.",

    "1": "The LBO limits for the TVC are found to be about 50% below those for the conventional combustors. Furthermore, the TVC LBO limits do not depend strongly on the loading parameters as those for conventional combustors.",
    "2": "Because of the stable recirculation zones in the flame-holding cavities, a TVC is expected to have low lean-blow-out (LBO) limits and good altitude relight capabilities."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately interprets the '50% below' statement, correctly explaining that TVC LBO limits are approximately 50% of conventional combustor values (meaning TVCs can operate at lower equivalence ratios before blowout). The explanation of stability mechanisms - cavity-based design creating stable recirculation zones with 'locked' vortices that provide continuous ignition sources - aligns with the original text's statement about 'stable recirculation zones in the flame-holding cavities.' The answer correctly quotes that 'the TVC LBO limits do not depend strongly on the loading parameters as those for conventional combustors,' demonstrating greater operational robustness. The physical principles regarding aerodynamic stability, shielding from main flow, and resistance to flow disturbances are sound and consistent with combustion science. While the answer is detailed, all statements are factually accurate and logically consistent with the original text.",

        "reasoning": "The answer correctly interprets '50% below' as TVC LBO limits being about half those of conventional combustors and accurately attributes the improvement to stable cavity recirculation (trapped vortices), which aligns with the cited aerodynamic mechanism. It also faithfully reflects the paper’s statement that TVC LBO limits do not depend strongly on loading parameters. No unsupported calculations or thermal mechanisms are introduced, and the causal explanations are physically sound and consistent with the original text.",

It accurately explains the stability mechanism based on the cavity's stable, shielded recirculation zone, which acts as a continuous ignition source. This explanation is a correct and standard elaboration on the principles mentioned in the original text.
