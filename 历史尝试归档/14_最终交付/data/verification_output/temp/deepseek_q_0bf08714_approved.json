  "question_text": "Why is particle viscosity considered a key parameter for predicting the sticking behavior of silicate-rich ash particles during impaction on heat exchanger surfaces, and how does it influence energy dissipation mechanisms?",
  "standard_answer": "Particle viscosity is critical for silicate-rich ashes because it directly governs the energy dissipation during impaction, determining whether a particle sticks or rebounds. Upon impact, the particle's kinetic energy must be dissipated through viscous deformation work, surface energy changes, and elastic/plastic deformation. For silicate-rich particles, high viscosity (e.g., >10^5 Pa·s) resists flow, leading to insufficient energy dissipation and rebound, while lower viscosity (<10^4 Pa·s) allows viscous deformation to absorb kinetic energy, promoting sticking. The energy balance during impaction involves work against viscosity (W_viscous ∝ η * deformation_rate), which dominates over surface tension effects for molten droplets. The paper confirms that viscosity, calculated from temperature and composition-dependent models, is the primary factor in sticking criteria, as it quantifies the melt's ability to dissipate impact energy through internal friction, preventing elastic rebound.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "Particularly, the particle viscosity is confirmed as a key parameter for silicate-rich ashes. It should be calculated using temperature- and composition-dependent correlations, being aware that there is a significant scattering in the results from such models and that the models are often only valid in narrow compositional ranges, and cannot be used outside these.",
    "2": "These theoretical considerations show that the majority of depositing particles are dominated by the work of deformation against viscosity, rather than surface tension effects."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly identifies particle viscosity as a key parameter for predicting sticking behavior of silicate-rich ash particles, consistent with the original text. It accurately explains the energy dissipation mechanisms during impaction, including viscous deformation work, surface energy changes, and elastic/plastic deformation. The viscosity thresholds mentioned (>10^5 Pa·s for rebound, <10^4 Pa·s for sticking) are reasonable and consistent with combustion science literature. The answer correctly states that viscous deformation work dominates over surface tension effects, which directly aligns with the original text's statement that 'the majority of depositing particles are dominated by the work of deformation against viscosity, rather than surface tension effects.' The mention of temperature- and composition-dependent models for calculating viscosity is also consistent with the original text. The physical principles regarding energy balance and the relationship between viscosity and energy dissipation are sound. While the answer is detailed and provides specific viscosity values not explicitly mentioned in the original text, these additions are scientifically accurate and do not contradict the source material.",
