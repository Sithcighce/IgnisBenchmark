  "question_text": "Using the kinetic model from Aradi et al., derive the relationship between net deposit rate and fuel flow rate loss, and explain how deposit formation and removal rates influence long-term injector performance.",
  "standard_answer": "The kinetic model by Aradi et al. describes injector deposit dynamics with the equation: dV/dt = K1 - K2·V, where V is dimensionless deposit volume, K1 is the zero-order deposit formation rate constant, and K2 is the first-order deposit removal rate constant. Integrating this gives V = (K1/K2)·(1 - exp(-K2·t)). Fuel flow rate loss is proportional to the reduction in flow area due to deposits. Since flow area loss relates to deposit volume, the flow rate loss becomes: Flow rate loss = -(K1/K2)·(1 - exp(-K2·t)). Initially, at small t, exp(-K2·t) ≈ 1 - K2·t, so loss ≈ -K1·t, showing rapid initial deposition. As t increases, exp(-K2·t) approaches zero, and loss stabilizes at -K1/K2, indicating equilibrium where formation and removal rates balance. High K1 (e.g., from high olefin content) accelerates initial fouling, while high K2 (e.g., from detergents or ethanol) enhances cleaning, reducing steady-state loss. This model explains why injector fouling shows an initial sharp decline in flow rate followed by a plateau, as observed in experiments.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly presents the Aradi et al. kinetic model with the differential equation dV/dt = K1 - K2·V and its integrated solution V = (K1/K2)·(1 - exp(-K2·t)). The fuel flow rate loss equation matches the original text exactly: Flow rate loss = -(K1/K2)·(1 - exp(-K2·t)). The mathematical approximation for small t (exp(-K2·t) ≈ 1 - K2·t leading to loss ≈ -K1·t) is correct. The physical interpretation is sound: initial rapid deposition transitioning to equilibrium at -K1/K2 when formation and removal balance. The discussion of K1 and K2 effects (high K1 from olefins accelerating fouling, high K2 from detergents/ethanol enhancing cleaning) is logically consistent with the model. All statements align with the original text and fundamental kinetic principles.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer reproduces the Aradi et al. kinetic model (dV/dt = K1 - K2·V) and correctly integrates it to V(t) = (K1/K2)(1 - e^{-K2 t}). It matches the ground-truth expression for fuel flow rate loss as –(K1/K2)(1 – e^{–K2 t}). The early-time linear behavior (≈ –K1 t) and long-time asymptote (–K1/K2) are correctly interpreted, and the roles of K1 (formation) and K2 (removal) in determining transient and steady-state injector performance are sound. No factual or logical contradictions with the original text.",
