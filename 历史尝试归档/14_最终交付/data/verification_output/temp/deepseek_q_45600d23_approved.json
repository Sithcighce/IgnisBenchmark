  "question_text": "How does cellulose crystallinity affect thermal degradation behavior during pyrolysis, and what is the relationship between crystallinity index and activation energy for thermal degradation?",
  "standard_answer": "Cellulose crystallinity significantly influences thermal degradation behavior during pyrolysis through structural differences between crystalline and amorphous regions. The cellulose crystalline region has better thermal stability than the amorphous region due to its packed cellulose structure, which creates a more organized and dense hydrogen-bonding network. This structural arrangement requires more energy input to initiate decomposition. Samples with lower crystallinity start to degrade at lower temperatures and exhibit sharper DTG curves, indicating faster decomposition kinetics in the amorphous regions. The relationship between crystallinity index and activation energy is inverse - lower crystallinity corresponds to lower thermal degradation activation energies. This occurs because amorphous cellulose has a less organized structure with weaker intermolecular forces, making it more susceptible to thermal breakdown. The ordered crystalline regions resist thermal disruption due to their dense packing and stronger hydrogen bonding, requiring higher energy barriers to be overcome during pyrolysis. This fundamental relationship between cellulose structure and thermal stability has important implications for biomass pyrolysis optimization and reactor design in energy conversion systems.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately reflects the information in the original text and demonstrates sound understanding of cellulose pyrolysis. Key points verified: (1) Crystalline regions have better thermal stability than amorphous regions due to packed structure - matches original text [1]. (2) Lower crystallinity correlates with lower degradation temperatures, sharper DTG curves, and lower activation energies - matches original text [2]. (3) The mechanistic explanations (hydrogen bonding networks, molecular packing, intermolecular forces) are scientifically sound and consistent with established polymer thermal degradation principles. (4) The inverse relationship between crystallinity index and activation energy is correctly stated and properly explained. The answer provides appropriate elaboration beyond the original text, but all additional explanations are accurate and logically consistent. No factual errors or contradictions detected.",
