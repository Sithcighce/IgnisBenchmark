  "question_text": "Based on the provided paper, what dual role do alkenes play in soot formation processes, specifically regarding polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) growth? Explain how this dual role relates to the production of resonantly stabilized free radicals (RSFRs) and small stable molecules during alkene pyrolysis.",
  "standard_answer": "According to the paper, alkenes play a dual role in soot formation processes that begin with the growth of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). First, during pyrolysis, alkenes supply resonantly stabilized free radicals (RSFRs) in large quantities through cleavage of the weakest allylic bonds. Second, alkene pyrolysis also produces small stable molecules like acetylene, which subsequently react to form PAHs. The paper explicitly states: 'Concerning soot formation processes, which begin with a growth of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), alkenes are believed to play a dual role. First, their pyrolysis supplies resonantly stabilized free radicals (RSFR), in large, by cleaving the weakest allylic bonds, and small stable molecules like acetylene which then react to form PAHs.' This dual mechanism involves both radical and molecular pathways for PAH precursor formation. However, the paper notes that 'Mechanistic details of these processes are still far from being well understood and their temperature- and pressure-dependent kinetic data are largely unknown,' indicating significant gaps remain in our understanding of the specific reaction pathways and their dependence on combustion conditions.",
