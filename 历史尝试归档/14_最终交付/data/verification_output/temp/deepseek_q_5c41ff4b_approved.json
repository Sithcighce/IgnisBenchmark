  "question_text": "Based on the provided paper content, how does the energy efficiency of fast gas heating (ηR) vary with reduced electric field (E/N) in air, and what general relationship between E/N and FGH efficiency can be established from the available experimental data and theoretical analysis?",
  "standard_answer": "The energy efficiency of fast gas heating (ηR) exhibits a strong dependence on reduced electric field (E/N) in air, with ηR increasing as E/N increases. This relationship is systematically analyzed across three different ranges of reduced electric field: E/N ≤ 150 Td, E/N = 150–400 Td, and E/N > 400 Td. The paper establishes that fast gas heating is more efficient at high E/N because more energy is stored in high energy electronic states of atoms and molecules. The fraction of energy spent on fast gas heating ηR has been suggested as a universal parameter to generalize the results of empirical research on energy relaxation, and this paper specifically considers the dependence of ηR on reduced electric field among other parameters. The analysis of available experimental data and theoretical calculations shows that as E/N increases, the efficiency of fast gas heating increases due to enhanced energy deposition into electronic excitation pathways that contribute more effectively to rapid thermalization. The paper provides a comprehensive overview of the progress in understanding fast gas heating kinetics and indicates that ηR serves as a key parameter for systematizing knowledge gained from studying different plasmas under varying discharge conditions.",
