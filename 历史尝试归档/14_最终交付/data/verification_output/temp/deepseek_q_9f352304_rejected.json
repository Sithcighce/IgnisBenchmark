  "question_text": "Quantitatively, how does the stoichiometric air-to-fuel ratio (AFR) of FPBO compare to conventional diesel, and what implications does this have for combustor air supply systems and emission control?",
  "standard_answer": "FPBO has a stoichiometric AFR of approximately 5–6 on a mass basis, roughly half that of diesel fuel (∼14.5). This reduction arises from FPBO's high oxygen content (30–40 wt.% dry), which supplies intrinsic oxidizer, reducing the external air required for complete combustion. The lower AFR means that for the same energy output, FPBO requires about 10–20% more combustion air by mass compared to diesel, due to its lower heating value (16–19 MJ/kg vs. 42–45 MJ/kg for diesel). Specifically, the volumetric air flow rate increases because LHV_FPBO/LHV_diesel ≈ 0.4, while AFR_FPBO/AFR_diesel ≈ 0.4, resulting in a higher air demand per unit energy. Combustors must be modified to provide increased air supply and enhanced mixing to avoid fuel-rich zones that elevate CO and UHC emissions. Staged combustion can leverage the lower AFR to create initial fuel-rich zones that convert fuel-bound nitrogen to N2 rather than NOx, reducing emissions. However, the higher air flow rates may increase pressure drops and require larger compressors or blowers, impacting system design and efficiency.",

The original text states that 10-20% more air is required for FPBO to maintain the same thermal energy release rate. However, the answer's mathematical explanation contradicts this: if AFR_FPBO is half that of diesel (≈0.5 ratio) and LHV_FPBO is also about 0.4 times diesel's LHV, then the air required per unit energy would be approximately (0.5/0.4) ≈ 1.25, which would be 25% more, not 10-20%. More critically, the answer misinterprets the mechanism - the increased air requirement is a direct consequence stated in the original text, not something that needs complex derivation from heating values. The answer also correctly identifies the stoichiometric AFR ratio and oxygen content, but the flawed reasoning about air requirements constitutes a significant logical error.",

However, it includes a key logical error: using AFR and LHV ratios both near 0.4 would imply equal air per unit energy (AFR/LHV), not higher, contradicting its own claim of increased air demand. It also implies that the lower AFR itself causes higher air demand, which is inaccurate; the lower LHV is the primary driver. The added staged-combustion/fuel-N discussion is speculative for FPBO.",

If these premises were true, the air demand per unit energy (which is proportional to AFR/LHV) would be roughly equal for both fuels (0.4 / 0.4 ≈ 1).
