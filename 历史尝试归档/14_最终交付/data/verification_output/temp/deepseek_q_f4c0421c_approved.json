  "question_text": "How does the Doppler shift in laser absorption spectroscopy enable flow velocity measurements, and what are the practical limitations in achieving high precision for high-speed flows?",
  "standard_answer": "The Doppler shift enables velocity measurements through the frequency shift Δν = (U/c) ν0 cosθ of absorption lines when gas flows relative to the laser beam. This shift arises from the motion of absorbing molecules altering the apparent laser frequency in their rest frame. For accurate velocity determination, the beam must propagate at an angle θ ≠ 90° to the flow direction. Practical limitations stem from the small magnitude of Δν: even at 300 m/s, Δν ≈ 0.003 cm^-1 for a 3000 cm^-1 line, requiring high-frequency-resolution techniques like frequency modulation spectroscopy (FMS) or dual-comb spectroscopy to resolve shifts smaller than the absorption linewidth. Beam steering due to density gradients and mechanical vibrations introduces noise, while temperature and pressure variations affect line position and width, complicating shift detection. Additionally, the path-averaged nature of LAS means velocity measurements represent an integrated value along the beam, limiting spatial resolution. Achieving high precision demands stable laser frequencies, precise angle alignment, and compensation for thermodynamic changes, often necessitating calibration under known conditions or simultaneous T/P measurements to decouple effects.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "If the beam propagates at an angle θ relative to the bulk velocity [72], the Doppler shift can be calculated as Δν = (U/c) ν0 cosθ, where U represents the mean bulk flow velocity and ν0 denotes the center frequency of the absorption line.",
    "2": "Because of the division by c in Eq. (13), the Doppler shift value of the absorption line is very small, even for velocities close to the speed of sound in ambient air."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly explains the Doppler shift mechanism for velocity measurements using the formula Δν = (U/c) ν0 cosθ, which matches the original text exactly. It accurately states that the shift arises from molecular motion and correctly notes the requirement for θ ≠ 90°. The answer properly identifies that Δν is very small even at high velocities (consistent with original text's statement about division by c making shifts small even near speed of sound), providing a concrete numerical example (0.003 cm^-1 at 300 m/s for a 3000 cm^-1 line) that illustrates this limitation. The discussion of practical limitations (beam steering, temperature/pressure effects, path-averaging, need for high-resolution techniques like FMS and dual-comb spectroscopy) represents reasonable elaboration on the challenges implied by the 'very small' shift mentioned in the original text. All physical principles are correctly stated, with no contradictions to the original text or fundamental combustion/spectroscopy science. The answer is detailed but contains no factual or logical errors.",
