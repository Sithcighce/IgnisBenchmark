  "question_text": "Based on the provided paper content, explain the role of nickel-based catalysts in biomass gasification systems, focusing on how they address tar formation and contribute to syngas production. Include the specific tar composition mentioned in the paper and describe the general catalytic functions without unsupported mechanistic details. Your answer must strictly use only information from the provided citations.",
  "standard_answer": "Nickel-based catalysts play a crucial role in biomass gasification by effectively reducing tar formation and enhancing syngas quality. According to the paper, 'Tar produced during gasification consists of mixed oxygenates, alkyl phenols, phenolic ethers, heterocyclic ethers and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons.' These complex tar compounds can cause operational problems in gasification systems. Nickel catalysts address this issue through their ability to facilitate specific catalytic functions. The paper states that 'Ni-based catalysts are extensively employed for tar reforming due to their high activity for C-C bond cleavage and steam activation.' This catalytic activity helps convert these tars into useful syngas components, improving the overall quality and composition of the syngas produced during biomass gasification processes. The use of nickel catalysts represents an important technological approach for managing tar-related challenges in biomass gasification systems while enhancing the production of valuable syngas for downstream applications.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately represents the information from the original text. It correctly quotes the tar composition ('mixed oxygenates, alkyl phenols, phenolic ethers, heterocyclic ethers and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons') and the catalytic properties of Ni-based catalysts ('high activity for C-C bond cleavage and steam activation'). The answer appropriately explains the role of nickel catalysts in reducing tar formation and enhancing syngas quality, which is a logical extension of the stated catalytic functions. The causal relationships are sound: tar causes operational problems → Ni catalysts facilitate C-C bond cleavage and steam activation → tars are converted to syngas components → syngas quality improves. No factual errors, contradictions, or logical flaws are present. The answer stays within the bounds of the provided citations and does not introduce unsupported mechanistic details.",
