  "question_text": "What distinguishes self-sustained smouldering from smouldering propagation, and how do heat and mass transfer inefficiencies affect the transition between these states?",
  "standard_answer": "Self-sustained smouldering is a local chemical process where net exothermic reactions (e.g., char oxidation) release sufficient energy to sustain themselves without external heat input, defined intrinsically by fuel chemistry and activation energies. In contrast, smouldering propagation is a global phenomenon involving the spatial and temporal movement of the reaction front through the porous bed, governed by heat and mass transfer. The transition from self-sustained smouldering to propagation requires that heat and mass transfer efficiencies allow the generated energy to preheat adjacent fuel and maintain oxygen supply. Inefficiencies—such as low thermal conductivity delaying heat diffusion or high flow resistance limiting oxygen access—can prevent propagation even if local reactions are exothermic. For instance, in opposed smouldering, oxygen diffusion against the front direction may starve reactions, while in forward smouldering, forced convection enhances oxygen delivery but increases convective losses. Thus, propagation depends on the interplay between local kinetics and global transport, where optima in permeability and thermal properties determine success.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "Self-sustained smouldering is an intrinsic (i.e., local) chemical process that does not consider heat and mass transfer throughout the porous fuel bed. Smouldering propagation is the result of complex heat and mass transfer processes.",
    "2": "The conditions leading to smouldering propagation always involve inefficiencies associated with heat and mass transfer that do not need to be considered when analysing the conditions leading to intrinsic self-sustained smouldering."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly distinguishes self-sustained smouldering as a local/intrinsic chemical process from smouldering propagation as a global phenomenon involving spatial/temporal movement governed by heat and mass transfer, which aligns with the original text. The answer accurately explains that propagation requires efficient heat and mass transfer to preheat adjacent fuel and maintain oxygen supply, and correctly identifies that inefficiencies (low thermal conductivity, high flow resistance) can prevent propagation even when local reactions are exothermic. The examples of opposed vs. forward smouldering correctly illustrate how transport limitations affect propagation. The answer appropriately elaborates on the original text's core concepts without contradicting them, providing mechanistic details that are physically sound and consistent with combustion science principles.",

It accurately distinguishes between self-sustained smouldering as a local chemical phenomenon and smouldering propagation as a global transport-driven process, which is perfectly aligned with the original text. The explanation of how heat and mass transfer inefficiencies (e.g., low thermal conductivity, high flow resistance) can prevent the transition from a self-sustaining state to a propagating one is sound.
