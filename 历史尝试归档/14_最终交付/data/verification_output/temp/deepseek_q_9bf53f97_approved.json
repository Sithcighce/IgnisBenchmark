  "question_text": "Based on the provided paper content, explain how biodiesel's higher viscosity and density affect engine performance and emissions in compression ignition engines, and what general engineering approaches are recommended to address these challenges according to the review.",
  "standard_answer": "Biodiesel's higher viscosity and density compared to mineral diesel significantly influence engine performance and emission characteristics in compression ignition engines. The paper states that 'Biodiesel has higher viscosity and density, 10-15% lower calorific value, higher bulk modulus, higher oxygen content, and lower stoichiometric air-fuel ratio compared to baseline mineral diesel.' These physical property differences directly contribute to the observed increase in brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) when using biodiesel, as the lower calorific value requires more fuel mass to be injected to achieve the same energy output. The higher oxygen content in biodiesel promotes more complete combustion, which helps explain the 'substantial reduction in particulate matter (PM), total hydrocarbons (THC) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions in comparison to mineral diesel' reported in the review. However, the combination of physical property differences necessitates hardware modifications to optimize engine performance. The review specifically emphasizes that 'future studies should focus on optimization of fuel injection equipment and hardware modifications to develop dedicated biodiesel engines' to properly address these challenges. This indicates that while the exact spray characteristics and injection timing adjustments aren't detailed in the provided excerpts, the fundamental property differences require systematic engineering optimization of the fuel injection system and engine hardware for biodiesel compatibility.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately reflects all key information from the original text. It correctly identifies biodiesel's physical properties (higher viscosity and density, 10-15% lower calorific value, higher oxygen content) from [1], properly explains the emission characteristics (reduction in PM, THC, CO; increase in BSFC and NOx) from [2], and accurately cites the recommended engineering approaches (optimization of fuel injection equipment and hardware modifications) from [3]. The causal relationships are logically sound: lower calorific value → higher BSFC, higher oxygen content → more complete combustion → reduced PM/THC/CO. The answer appropriately acknowledges that specific spray characteristics and injection timing details aren't provided in the excerpts while correctly emphasizing the need for systematic engineering optimization. All statements are consistent with combustion science principles and the original text.",
