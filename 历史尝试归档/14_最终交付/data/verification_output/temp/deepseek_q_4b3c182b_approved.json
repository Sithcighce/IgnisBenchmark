  "question_text": "Why do nitrogen-containing functional groups on biochar become more influential than pore texture for SO2 adsorption at elevated temperatures (~120°C), and how do these groups facilitate chemisorption?",
  "standard_answer": "At elevated temperatures (~120°C), physisorption diminishes due to reduced van der Waals interactions and increased molecular kinetic energy, making pore texture less effective. Nitrogen-containing functional groups, introduced via ammonia or amine modification, dominate chemisorption by acting as Lewis bases that donate electrons to the electrophilic sulfur atom in SO2. This forms stable complexes, such as sulfates or sulfites, through reactions like R2CH3N + SO2 + 1/2 O2 + H2O → (R2CH3NH)2·SO4. The pre-oxidation of biochar creates oxygenated anchoring sites that enhance nitrogen incorporation, further boosting chemisorption. These groups provide active sites that are thermally stable and facilitate chemical bonding, overcoming the limitations of physical adsorption at higher temperatures.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "At the higher adsorption temperature of 120°C, the SO2 adsorption capacity of biochar presented a strong linear relationship with its N/C mass ratio, indicating the chemisorption come from nitrogen-containing functional groups were primary factor.",
    "2": "The nitrogen functionalities onto the biochar are more influential than the pore texture for the adsorption of SO2, with the conversion to N–H groups."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly explains why nitrogen-containing functional groups become more influential than pore texture at elevated temperatures. It accurately describes: (1) the diminishing of physisorption at higher temperatures due to reduced van der Waals interactions and increased kinetic energy, making pore texture less effective; (2) nitrogen groups acting as Lewis bases for chemisorption with SO2; (3) the formation of stable complexes like sulfates/sulfites; and (4) the role of pre-oxidation in creating anchoring sites. The answer is consistent with the original text's statements about the linear relationship between SO2 adsorption and N/C ratio at 120°C, and that nitrogen functionalities are more influential than pore texture. The mention of N-H groups in the original text aligns with the answer's discussion of amine modification. While the answer is detailed and includes specific reaction mechanisms not explicitly stated in the original text excerpts, these additions are scientifically sound and do not contradict the source material. The core mechanisms are correctly explained.",

        ],
        "reasoning": "The answer correctly states that at ~120°C physisorption weakens, making pore texture less decisive, and that nitrogen functionalities dominate SO2 adsorption via chemisorption—fully consistent with the original text’s emphasis on N/C correlation and the primacy of nitrogen groups. The mechanistic explanation (basic N sites interacting with electrophilic SO2 and forming sulfite/sulfate species, aided by oxygen/water) is physically sound and aligns with literature. Minor issues are the lack of explicit mention of N–H conversion and a somewhat imprecise illustrative reaction, but these do not undermine the core correctness.",

It accurately states that physisorption (dependent on pore texture) diminishes at higher temperatures due to increased kinetic energy, while chemisorption via nitrogen functional groups (acting as Lewis bases) becomes dominant. The proposed mechanism of Lewis acid-base interaction between N-groups and SO2 is chemically sound and consistent with the original text. All statements are factually and logically correct.",
