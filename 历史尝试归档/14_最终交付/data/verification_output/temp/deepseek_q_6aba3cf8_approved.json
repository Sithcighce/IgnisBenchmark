  "question_text": "How does radiative heat transfer couple with temperature distribution in SOFC modeling, and what are the mathematical formulations for radiosity in planar and tubular configurations?",
  "standard_answer": "Radiative heat transfer in SOFCs couples strongly with temperature distribution through the radiosity method, which accounts for energy exchange between solid surfaces (PEN, interconnector, air supply tube) and with the environment. The coupling occurs because surface radiosities depend on both local temperature (through the blackbody emission term) and the radiation arriving from other surfaces (through view factors). For the planar and tubular geometries, the radiosity BPEN at position z on the PEN surface is governed by an integral equation that includes: emission from the local surface (εPENσBTPEN^4), reflection of incoming radiation from other surfaces, and view factors that geometrically weight the contributions from all other surface elements. The mathematical formulation involves solving coupled integral equations for each surface element's radiosity, where the view factors F account for the geometric configuration and determine how much radiation from one surface element reaches another. In planar SOFCs, radiation occurs between parallel PEN and interconnector surfaces, while in tubular designs, cylindrical geometry creates more complex view factor relationships involving the air supply tube and annular flow passages. This radiation coupling significantly affects temperature gradients, particularly in high-temperature operation where radiative fluxes can be comparable to convective and conductive heat transfer.",
