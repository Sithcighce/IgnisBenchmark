  "question_text": "How does the thermal runaway mechanism in lithium-ion batteries transition from stable thermal equilibrium to self-accelerating decomposition, and what critical temperature conditions govern this transition according to the Semenov model?",
  "standard_answer": "The transition from stable thermal equilibrium to self-accelerating decomposition in lithium-ion batteries is governed by the balance between heat generation from exothermic reactions and heat dissipation to the environment, as described by the Semenov model. Initially, at lower ambient temperatures, the system reaches a stable equilibrium where any temperature deviation is counteracted by higher heat loss rates. However, as ambient temperature increases, the heat loss line becomes tangent to the exponential heat generation curve at a critical point called the 'Temperature of No Return (T_NR)'. Beyond this point, even a slight temperature increase causes heat generation to exceed dissipation, leading to uncontrolled temperature rise and thermal runaway. This critical equilibrium temperature corresponds to the self-accelerating decomposition temperature (SADT), where the system can no longer maintain stability. The exponential heat generation follows Arrhenius kinetics, driven by reactions such as SEI decomposition, anode-electrolyte interactions, and cathode decomposition, while heat dissipation follows Newton's law of cooling. The Biot number condition (Bi < 0.1) ensures negligible internal temperature gradients, validating the Semenov approximation for uniform temperature scenarios in LIBs under external heating.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "When the ambient temperature increases to B, line 2 has one tangent point D with line 4. At this point, the heat loss rate is equal to the heat generation rate, and once the system temperature increases a little, the system’s temperature will continue to rise at a progressively higher rate. This critical equilibrium temperature is called the 'Temperature of No Return, T_NR'.",
    "2": "And the ambient temperature B is the self-accelerating decomposition temperature (SADT). LIB can be regarded as a reaction system, in which the heat comes from the electrochemical reactions between its components."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately describes the thermal runaway mechanism in lithium-ion batteries according to the Semenov model. It correctly explains: (1) the balance between heat generation and dissipation, (2) the critical tangent point where heat loss equals heat generation (T_NR), (3) the relationship between T_NR and SADT, (4) the exponential nature of heat generation following Arrhenius kinetics, (5) Newton's law of cooling for heat dissipation, and (6) the Biot number condition for uniform temperature. All statements are consistent with the original text and fundamental thermophysical principles. The answer provides additional valid context (SEI decomposition, Arrhenius kinetics, Biot number) that enhances understanding without contradicting the source material.",

        "reasoning": "The answer correctly describes the Semenov balance, tangency condition, Arrhenius heat generation, Newtonian cooling, and the Biot number assumption. However, it incorrectly associates the critical equilibrium temperature (T_NR) with SADT. Per the provided ground truth, SADT refers to the ambient temperature at which the system’s heat-loss line is tangent to the heat-generation curve; the corresponding system temperature is T_NR. This mismatch constitutes a factual inconsistency with the original text.",
