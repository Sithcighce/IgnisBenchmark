  "standard_answer": "The transition from column breakup to surface breakup in a non-turbulent liquid jet in a gaseous crossflow is governed by the gas Weber number (We_g = ρ_g u_g^2 d_j/σ), which represents the ratio of aerodynamic forces to surface tension forces. According to the paper, 'column breakup can be observed at low q and/or low We_g, and the surface breakup regime occurs at high q and/or high We_g.' This indicates that at lower We_g values, column breakup dominates, where the liquid column undergoes large-scale deformations and fractures. As We_g increases, surface breakup becomes prevalent, characterized by small-scale instabilities on the windward side of the jet leading to continuous stripping of ligaments and droplets. The paper states that 'both column and surface breakup mechanisms coexist but with the predominance of one over the other,' highlighting the competitive nature of these instabilities. The transition is gradual, and while We_g is a key parameter, the exact thresholds can vary with conditions like momentum flux ratio (q). The mechanisms involve aerodynamic forces similar to droplet breakup processes, where increased We_g enhances surface instabilities, reducing jet coherence and promoting atomization through surface stripping.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "Wu et al. [27] asserted that since the breakup process of a liquid jet and a spherical droplet in an airflow are both caused by aerodynamic forces, the general understanding of the aerodynamic secondary breakup of drops could be applicable to the primary breakup of a liquid jet.",
    "2": "They concluded that column breakup can be observed at low q and/or low We_g, and the surface breakup regime occurs at high q and/or high We_g."

The descriptions of both breakup regimes are physically sound. The answer correctly links the jet breakup process to the aerodynamic breakup of droplets, as supported by the original text. While it misattributes a statement about the coexistence of mechanisms as a direct quote, the concept itself is a correct physical interpretation of a transition between two regimes and does not contradict the source text, which only describes the limiting cases.
