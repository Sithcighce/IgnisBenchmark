  "question_text": "How does the thermal decomposition of hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin during torrefaction influence the energy density enhancement of biomass, and what are the key reaction mechanisms driving this transformation?",
  "standard_answer": "The thermal decomposition of lignocellulosic components during torrefaction significantly enhances biomass energy density through selective devolatilization and deoxygenation. Hemicellulose decomposes first at 200–300°C, releasing substantial volatiles (CO2, CO, H2O) and reducing oxygen content via dehydration and decarboxylation, which increases the carbon-to-oxygen ratio. Cellulose, being more thermally stable, degrades slightly at higher temperatures (250–300°C), contributing to energy retention due to its high carbon content. Lignin undergoes demethoxylation and condensation reactions, forming aromatic structures that boost heating value. The key mechanisms include: (1) Dehydration reactions removing hydroxyl groups, reducing hydrophilic nature and increasing carbon concentration. (2) Decarboxylation and decarbonylation releasing CO2 and CO, which lowers oxygen content disproportionately to carbon, elevating the higher heating value (HHV). (3) Recondensation of lignin and cellulose into more stable, energy-dense aromatic chars. As the paper states, 'Biomass undergoing torrefaction loses more oxygen and hydrogen than carbon, thereby increasing the heating value of the product char.' This selective removal, coupled with the preservation of carbon-rich structures, results in energy density enhancement factors (EDEF) greater than 1, making torrefied biomass a superior solid fuel.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately describes the thermal decomposition mechanisms during torrefaction and is consistent with the original text. Key points verified: (1) Correctly states hemicellulose decomposes first at 200-300°C, aligning with original text stating torrefaction starts at 200°C with hemicellulose decomposition. (2) Accurately describes cellulose degradation at 250-300°C, consistent with original text noting significant changes after 250°C with degradation of cellulose and lignin. (3) Correctly explains the fundamental mechanism that biomass loses more oxygen and hydrogen than carbon, directly quoting the original text. (4) The chemical mechanisms described (dehydration, decarboxylation, decarbonylation, lignin condensation) are scientifically sound and consistent with established torrefaction chemistry. (5) The cause-effect relationship between selective devolatilization and energy density enhancement is logically correct. (6) The concept of EDEF > 1 follows logically from the preferential removal of oxygen and hydrogen. While the answer is detailed and comprehensive, all statements are factually accurate and no contradictions with the original text exist.",

        ],
        "reasoning": "The answer is consistent with the ground truth: hemicellulose decomposes first around 200–300°C; more pronounced changes occur after ~250°C with some cellulose and lignin degradation. It correctly links selective loss of O and H (via dehydration, decarboxylation/decarbonylation) to increased HHV/energy density and notes lignin condensation/demethoxylation. Minor imprecisions do not contradict the core mechanisms.",
