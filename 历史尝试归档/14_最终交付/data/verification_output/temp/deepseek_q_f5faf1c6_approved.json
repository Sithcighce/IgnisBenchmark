  "question_text": "What is the primary degradation mechanism for silver-based MECC membranes at high temperatures, and how can surface modifications address this issue?",
  "standard_answer": "The primary degradation mechanism for silver-based MECC membranes at high temperatures is sintering of the porous silver matrix. This sintering process causes structural changes in the silver matrix that reduce CO₂ flux over time. Surface modifications and microstructural optimization are effective strategies to improve the stability of Ag-MC membranes by preventing or minimizing silver particle agglomeration and maintaining the structural integrity of the porous matrix. These modifications help preserve the continuous network required for electronic conduction and maintain the triple-phase boundaries where CO₂ ionization reactions occur, thereby extending membrane operational lifetime and maintaining CO₂ transport performance.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "The cause for the degradation was attributed to the sintering of porous silver matrix as indicated in Fig. 5b and c. Surface modification and microstructural optimization were considered to improve the stability of the Ag-MC membranes.",
    "2": "To avoid the chemical compatibility problem between SS and MC, silver (Ag), which shows not only a higher electronic conductivity, but also better stability with MC, has been studied as a porous matrix material by Huang group."

It correctly explains that sintering causes structural changes reducing CO₂ flux, and appropriately identifies surface modifications and microstructural optimization as solutions to improve stability. The answer provides reasonable elaboration on the mechanisms (preventing agglomeration, maintaining structural integrity, preserving triple-phase boundaries) that are consistent with established principles of MECC membrane operation and the context provided in the original text. All factual statements are accurate and logically sound.",
