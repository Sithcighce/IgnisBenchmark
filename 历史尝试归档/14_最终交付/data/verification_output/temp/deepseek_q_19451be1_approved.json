  "question_text": "What are the key mechanisms by which methane absorbs infrared radiation and contributes to global warming, and how does the saturation effect influence the relationship between methane concentration and radiative forcing?",
  "standard_answer": "Methane acts as a potent greenhouse gas through absorption of long-wave infrared radiation in specific wavelength bands where its molecular vibrations create dipole moment changes. The carbon-hydrogen bonds in methane vibrate at frequencies that correspond to infrared wavelengths clustered at 7-13 μm (wave numbers 1200-1400 cm⁻¹), with the most significant absorption feature at 7.66 μm (1306 cm⁻¹). When Earth-emitted infrared radiation at these wavelengths encounters methane molecules, the energy is absorbed, exciting the vibrational modes of the C-H bonds. This absorbed energy is then re-emitted in all directions, with a portion returning to the Earth's surface, creating the greenhouse effect. Unlike carbon dioxide, methane's absorption bands are not completely saturated at current atmospheric concentrations, meaning each additional methane molecule continues to contribute to radiative forcing. However, the relationship follows a square root dependence on concentration due to partial saturation effects in the absorption bands. This means that while methane's global warming potential is 28-36 times that of CO2 over 100 years, the incremental warming effect decreases as concentrations increase. The non-saturated nature of methane's absorption bands, combined with its atmospheric chemistry feedbacks through OH· consumption, makes it a particularly important short-term climate forcer despite its relatively short atmospheric lifetime.",

Key facts verified: (1) Methane absorbs infrared radiation at 7-13 μm wavelengths (1200-1400 cm⁻¹) with the most important feature at 7.66 μm (1306 cm⁻¹) - matches original text exactly. (2) The square root dependence of radiative forcing on concentration due to partial saturation is correctly stated and explained. (3) The physical mechanism of C-H bond vibrations absorbing and re-emitting infrared radiation is scientifically sound. The answer provides additional context (GWP values, atmospheric lifetime, OH· chemistry) that goes beyond the original text but is factually accurate and relevant. No contradictions, factual errors, or logical flaws detected.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly describes methane’s infrared absorption in the 7–13 μm region with a key feature at 7.66 μm (1306 cm⁻¹), and accurately states that radiative forcing increases approximately with the square root of concentration due to partial saturation—both matching the original text. The greenhouse mechanism explanation is physically sound. Minor extraneous content (GWP value range) may be imprecise but does not undermine the core correctness regarding mechanisms and saturation effects.",
