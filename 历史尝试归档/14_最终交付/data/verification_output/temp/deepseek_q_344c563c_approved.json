  "standard_answer": "Fluidized-bed reactors effectively overcome ammonia's combustion challenges through several key mechanisms. The hot bed material acts as a massive heat reservoir that ensures reliable ignition despite ammonia's high autoignition temperature (~930 K) and large minimum ignition energy (~20 mJ). This thermal mass provides continuous energy input to sustain combustion, addressing ammonia's difficulty in achieving stable flame propagation. The intense mixing environment characteristic of fluidized beds creates excellent heat and mass transfer between bed particles, reacting gas, and heat transfer surfaces, which compensates for ammonia's slow laminar flame speed (~6.5 cm/s) and high lower flammability limit (15-28% V/V). This enhanced transfer environment allows for higher burning rates and volumetric heat release rates than would be possible in conventional combustion systems. The fluidized-bed's operational flexibility enables combustion at lower temperatures (1000-1300 K range) than traditional systems, which is particularly beneficial for ammonia given its poor combustion characteristics. Additionally, the presence of solid bed material facilitates more complete combustion across a wider range of operating conditions, overcoming the flame stability issues that plague ammonia in conventional burners and furnaces.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "The hot bed material in the fluidised-bed acts as a huge heat reservoir which ensures reliable ignition and stable combustion at relatively low temperatures. Additionally, the effective heat and mass transfer environment yields high burning rates and thus higher volumetric heat release rates.",
    "2": "This results in effective mixing which, coupled with the high heat capacity of the solid particles, leads to excellent heat and mass transfer between the bed particles, reacting gas, and any other heat transfer surfaces present."

The answer correctly explains how these mechanisms address ammonia's combustion challenges. However, the answer includes numerous specific numerical values and technical details about ammonia properties that are not verifiable from the provided original text excerpts. While these values appear plausible for ammonia combustion characteristics, I cannot confirm their accuracy without access to the full paper. The elaboration on how these mechanisms specifically overcome ammonia's poor burning characteristics (slow flame speed, high ignition energy, etc.) represents logical extension rather than direct quotation, but the reasoning appears sound. Given that the numerical values cannot be verified and represent a significant portion of the answer's content, I'm marking verification_confidence as medium rather than high.",
