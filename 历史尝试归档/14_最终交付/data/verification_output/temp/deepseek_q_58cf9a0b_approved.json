  "question_text": "How does bed channelling affect the stability and efficiency of fixed-bed biomass combustion, and what operational or design strategies can mitigate its occurrence?",
  "standard_answer": "Bed channelling occurs when interconnected void spaces in the packed bed create preferential pathways for air flow, leading to non-uniform ignition front propagation. This phenomenon destabilizes combustion by causing chaotic burning patterns, significant temperature fluctuations, and localized peaks that can damage equipment. Channelling reduces combustion efficiency because air bypasses densely packed regions, leaving unburned fuel and increasing carbon-in-ash losses. It also exacerbates pollutant emissions by creating oxygen-rich and oxygen-deficient zones that promote CO and NOx formation. Mitigation strategies include optimizing particle size distribution to minimize void spaces, using graded bed packing to ensure uniform porosity, and employing grates that induce gentle bed movement to disrupt channel formation. Additionally, controlling air flux below critical levels where channelling initiates and implementing staged air injection can help distribute oxidant more evenly. In laboratory settings, uniform particle sizing and careful bed preparation are essential to avoid channelling and obtain reproducible results that accurately reflect industrial conditions.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "Channelling is caused by interconnected void spaces in the matrix formed by the packed bed, allowing air or gases to flow in preferential paths. These preferential routes cause the ignition front to propagate much faster along the inner surfaces of the passage than over other surfaces of the bed, causing chaotic burning patterns and significant fluctuations and peaks in temperature.",
    "2": "Fuel particles are ideally packed in a laboratory-scale fixed-bed reactor with a uniform size distribution. Otherwise, the odd high-porosity spots inside the bed may induce bed channelling."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately describes bed channelling mechanisms and is fully consistent with the original text. It correctly explains that channelling occurs due to interconnected void spaces creating preferential air flow pathways, leading to non-uniform ignition front propagation, chaotic burning patterns, and temperature fluctuations (matching [1]). The answer appropriately extends beyond the original text to discuss efficiency impacts, pollutant formation, and mitigation strategies - all of which are scientifically sound applications of the core channelling mechanism. The mention of uniform particle sizing and bed preparation to avoid high-porosity spots aligns with [2]. The additional details about operational strategies (air flux control, staged injection, grate design) represent reasonable engineering solutions to the described problem and contain no factual errors or logical contradictions. The answer is comprehensive but accurate throughout.",

        "reasoning": "The answer aligns with the ground truth: it correctly attributes channelling to interconnected voids creating preferential flow paths and links it to chaotic burning and temperature fluctuations. It reasonably extends impacts to efficiency (unburned fuel, carbon-in-ash) and emissions (maldistributed oxygen leading to CO/NOx), which are consistent with combustion principles. Mitigation via uniform particle sizing and careful bed preparation matches the source; additional strategies (graded packing, gentle grate movement, staged air, managing air flux) are plausible and do not contradict the original text.",
