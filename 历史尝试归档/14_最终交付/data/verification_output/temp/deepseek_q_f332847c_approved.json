  "question_text": "How do the governing equations for premixed (G-equation) and non-premixed (Z-equation) flames differ in their treatment of flame dynamics, and what physical mechanisms underlie these differences?",
  "standard_answer": "The G-equation for premixed flames and Z-equation for non-premixed flames differ fundamentally in their mathematical structure and physical interpretation. The G-equation (∂G/∂t + u·∇G = s_d|∇G|) is nonlinear due to the flame propagation term s_d|∇G|, where s_d represents the displacement speed relative to the flow. This term accounts for flame propagation normal to itself, making premixed flame dynamics dependent only on the local flow velocity at the flame sheet. In contrast, the Z-equation (∂Z/∂t + u·∇Z = D∇²Z) is linear and contains a diffusion operator rather than a propagation term, reflecting that non-premixed flames do not propagate but rather exist where fuel and oxidizer mix diffusively at stoichiometric conditions. Physically, this means premixed flame dynamics are determined solely by the velocity field at the flame surface, while non-premixed flame dynamics depend on the entire velocity field throughout the domain. The G-equation is only physically meaningful at the flame surface (G=0), whereas the Z-equation describes the actual mixture fraction field everywhere, requiring solution of the entire field to extract the flame sheet position Z=Z_st.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "The G-equation is physically meaningful and valid only at the flame itself where G(x,t)=0 (i.e., although it can be solved away from the flame, the resulting G values have no physical significance).",
    "2": "In contrast, the Z-equation describes the physical values of the mixture fraction field everywhere. This point was alluded to earlier as well for constant property surfaces, whose dynamics are determined by the instantaneous property field, rather than simply the velocity at the surface."

It accurately states that: (1) G-equation is nonlinear with propagation term s_d|∇G| while Z-equation is linear with diffusion term D∇²Z; (2) G-equation is physically meaningful only at the flame surface (G=0), consistent with original text point [1]; (3) Z-equation describes the mixture fraction field everywhere and requires solving the entire field to locate the flame at Z=Z_st, consistent with original text point [2]; (4) The physical mechanisms are correctly explained - premixed flames propagate normal to themselves based on local velocity, while non-premixed flames exist where diffusive mixing achieves stoichiometric conditions. All mathematical expressions, physical principles, and cause-effect relationships are accurate and consistent with the original text.",

          "The phrase 'premixed flame dynamics dependent only on the local flow velocity at the flame sheet' is imprecise; dynamics depend on both local velocity and displacement speed s_d (which can include effects of stretch/curvature).",
          "The statement 'non-premixed flames do not propagate' is a simplification; more precisely, the flame sheet position arises from advection–diffusion of mixture fraction (and chemistry), not a front-propagation law."
        ],
        "reasoning": "The answer correctly contrasts the G-equation’s front-propagation character (valid at G=0) with the Z-equation’s advection–diffusion nature that defines a physical field everywhere and requires solving the full domain to locate Z=Z_st, consistent with the ground-truth text. Equations provided are standard forms; the recognition of nonlinearity in G and linearity in Z is accurate. Minor wording issues do not affect the core correctness.",
