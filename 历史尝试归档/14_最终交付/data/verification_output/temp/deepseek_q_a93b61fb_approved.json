  "question_text": "How does the global energy balance concept explain the ability to predict smouldering reaction fate before global heat exchange impacts the reaction, and what role does the cumulative integration of processes in space and time play in this prediction?",
  "standard_answer": "The global energy balance concept reveals that smouldering front evolution, while appearing as a local process, is actually determined by a cumulative energy balance integrated over the entire system volume and time. This approach allows prediction of smouldering reaction fate before global heat exchange effects manifest in the reaction. The key insight is that smouldering propagation results from complex heat and mass transfer processes involving exchange of heat, oxygen, and combustion products that enable self-sustained smouldering to propagate through porous media. By considering the integral of energy generation and loss processes across the entire fuel bed and over time, rather than focusing solely on local temperature peaks or instantaneous conditions, operators can anticipate whether smouldering will be self-sustaining or lead to extinction. This predictive capability is particularly valuable in engineered smouldering applications where maintaining self-sustained propagation is essential for harnessing the energy released by the reaction effectively.",

The answer appropriately elaborates on these concepts by explaining the practical implications (predictive capability, self-sustained vs extinction outcomes, engineered applications) without introducing factual errors or contradictions. The physical principles are correctly stated, and the cause-effect relationships are sound.
