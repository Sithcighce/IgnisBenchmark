  "question_text": "How do redox reactions of metal catalysts and oxygen vacancies in functionalized biochar enhance NOx removal performance in selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems, and what is the role of NH3 adsorption ability in this process?",
  "standard_answer": "In biochar-based SCR catalysts, the redox reactions of metal catalysts and the formation of oxygen vacancies significantly enhance NOx removal performance through improved catalytic activity and NH3 adsorption. The redox reactions of metal catalysts in biochar, particularly transition metals like Mn and Ce, facilitate electron transfer and oxidation processes that convert NO to more reactive species. Oxygen vacancies created during functionalization adsorb oxygen from the flue gas to form chemisorbed oxygen, which is more active and has higher mobility than lattice oxygen, playing an important role in catalytic reactions. These oxygen vacancies and redox-active sites improve the adsorption ability of NH3 on the biochar surface, where NH3 can bind to both Lewis and Brønsted acid sites. The enhanced NH3 adsorption capacity, combined with the redox activity, enables more efficient reaction with NO according to the standard SCR reaction (4NH3 + 4NO + O2 → 4N2 + 6H2O), leading to higher NO conversion efficiencies, particularly at low temperatures where traditional catalysts are less effective.",

The answer provides appropriate elaboration on transition metals (Mn, Ce), Lewis and Brønsted acid sites, and the standard SCR reaction mechanism, which are all consistent with established SCR catalysis principles.
