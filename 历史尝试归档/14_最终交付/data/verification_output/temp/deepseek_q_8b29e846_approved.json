  "question_text": "How does preferential diffusion of hydrogen relative to oxygen affect the catalytic equivalence ratio and surface temperatures in fuel-lean H₂/air combustion on platinum catalysts?",
  "standard_answer": "Preferential diffusion of hydrogen relative to oxygen significantly alters the local catalytic equivalence ratio and surface temperatures in fuel-lean H₂/air combustion due to the substantial difference in molecular diffusivities. Hydrogen has approximately 4 times higher diffusivity than oxygen in air, leading to enhanced transport of H₂ to the catalytic surface compared to O₂. This diffusional imbalance causes the local fuel-to-oxygen ratio at the catalyst surface to be approximately 2.4 times higher than the bulk gas equivalence ratio. The enhanced hydrogen concentration at the surface drives higher catalytic reaction rates and produces superadiabatic surface temperatures exceeding the adiabatic flame temperature. This phenomenon occurs because the preferential diffusion enriches the boundary layer with the more mobile hydrogen molecules, creating a locally fuel-rich environment at the catalyst despite the overall fuel-lean bulk mixture. The superadiabatic temperatures result from the combined effects of enhanced reaction rates due to hydrogen enrichment and the exothermic nature of catalytic oxidation. Conversely, for high hydrocarbon fuels (C₂+), the catalytic equivalence ratio becomes lower than the bulk gas equivalence ratio due to their lower diffusivities relative to oxygen, leading to underadiabatic surface temperatures. Turbulence moderates these preferential diffusion effects by equalizing species transport rates, further complicating the identification of the true deficient reactant in practical catalytic systems.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately explains the preferential diffusion phenomenon and its effects. Key facts are correct: (1) H₂ diffusivity is ~4x higher than O₂, (2) local catalytic equivalence ratio is ~2.4x the bulk ratio for fuel-lean H₂/air, (3) this leads to superadiabatic surface temperatures in fuel-lean H₂ combustion, (4) opposite effect occurs for C₂+ hydrocarbons leading to underadiabatic temperatures. The mechanistic explanation (hydrogen enrichment at boundary layer, enhanced reaction rates, exothermic oxidation) is physically sound and logically consistent. The answer provides additional context about turbulence effects and diffusivity differences, which are correct elaborations. All statements align with the original text and established combustion science principles.",
