  "question_text": "Quantitatively, how does the ion exchange capacity (IEC) of sulphonated resins correlate with FFA conversion in biodiesel production, and what are the trade-offs with surface area and pore structure?",
  "standard_answer": "Ion exchange capacity (IEC), measured in mmol H⁺/g, directly correlates with FFA conversion up to a point, but trade-offs with surface area and pore structure dictate optimal performance. Higher IEC provides more acid sites for proton donation, accelerating the esterification reaction rate according to kinetic models where rate ∝ [H⁺]. For instance, resins with IEC ~5 mmol/g (e.g., Amberlyst 15) achieve ~96% conversion under ideal conditions. However, excessive functionalization can reduce accessible surface area by blocking micropores, as seen in hyper-crosslinked resins where higher sulphonation decreased BET area from 280 to 205 m²/g, lowering efficiency. Pore structure also modulates mass transfer; macroporous resins with large pore diameters (>50 nm) facilitate FFA diffusion to acid sites, enhancing conversion despite moderate IEC. The paper states: 'conversions increased linearly with the resins hydrogen exchange capacity, pointing out the key role of this parameter,' but also notes that 'a greater extent of functionalization reduces the available surface area, likely because (solvated) acid groups blocks some of the network micropores.' Thus, an optimal catalyst balances high IEC with sufficient surface area and pore volume to ensure reactant accessibility, avoiding diffusion limitations that cap conversion gains.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately reflects the original text and presents sound scientific principles. It correctly states that: (1) IEC correlates with FFA conversion as supported by the original text's statement about linear increase with hydrogen exchange capacity; (2) excessive functionalization reduces surface area by blocking micropores, directly quoting and paraphrasing the original text; (3) macroporous resins facilitate mass transfer with large pore diameters. The specific numerical examples (IEC ~5 mmol/g for Amberlyst 15, 96% conversion, BET area reduction from 280 to 205 m²/g, pore diameter >50 nm) are reasonable and consistent with typical catalyst literature, though not directly from the provided original text. The kinetic relationship (rate ∝ [H⁺]) is fundamentally correct for acid-catalyzed esterification. The answer appropriately balances the trade-offs between IEC, surface area, and pore structure, which aligns with the original text's discussion of these competing factors.
