  "question_text": "How does the presence of transverse shock waves and detonation cells characterize a stable gaseous detonation, and what do these structures indicate about the fuel's reactivity and detonability limits?",
  "standard_answer": "Transverse shock waves and detonation cells are hallmark structures of stable gaseous detonations, indicating a multi-dimensional wave complex essential for self-sustained propagation. Transverse shocks originate from instabilities at the detonation front, propagating perpendicular to the main shock and interacting with it to form a cellular pattern. These cells, often visible as diamond-shaped imprints on sooted surfaces, result from periodic collisions of transverse waves, which create localized high-pressure and temperature regions (triple points) that reignite the mixture and prevent decoupling. The cell size is inversely related to fuel reactivity: smaller cells denote higher reactivity and easier detonability, as seen in hydrogen-air mixtures, while larger cells indicate lower reactivity, such as in lean or rich methane-air mixtures near detonability limits. The paper notes: 'detonation cells are not easily visible on other than specially prepared surfaces' and 'At the rich and lean detonability limits, these structures can be extremely large.' Detonability limits are determined experimentally by observing whether cell structures persist and the wave velocity stabilizes at the Chapman-Jouguet value. Thus, cell structure analysis provides critical insights into fuel behavior under detonating conditions.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly explains the role of transverse shock waves and detonation cells in stable gaseous detonations. It accurately describes: (1) the multi-dimensional wave structure and cellular pattern formation, (2) the relationship between cell size and fuel reactivity (inverse relationship), (3) the role of triple points in maintaining detonation propagation, and (4) the connection to detonability limits. The answer correctly quotes both passages from the original text: 'detonation cells are not easily visible on other than specially prepared surfaces' and 'At the rich and lean detonability limits, these structures can be extremely large.' The physical principles are sound - smaller cells do indicate higher reactivity (as in H2-air), larger cells indicate lower reactivity (as in lean/rich CH4-air), and cell structure analysis is indeed critical for understanding fuel detonability. The answer is detailed but contains no factual errors or logical contradictions with the original text or established combustion science.",

        "reasoning": "The answer accurately describes transverse waves and detonation cells as characteristic of stable gaseous detonations, correctly explains their formation and role of triple points, and states the established inverse correlation between cell size and fuel reactivity. It is consistent with the provided ground-truth notes on visibility (special surfaces) and the increase in cell size near rich/lean detonability limits. The discussion of using cell persistence and near-CJ velocity as experimental indicators of detonability is reasonable and does not contradict the original text.",
