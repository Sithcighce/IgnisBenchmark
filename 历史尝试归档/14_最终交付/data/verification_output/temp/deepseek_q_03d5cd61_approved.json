  "question_text": "In the context of combustion machine learning applications, how does the maximum likelihood estimation framework enable parameter determination from experimental and computational data, and what are its key statistical properties according to the provided paper?",
  "standard_answer": "Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) provides a rigorous statistical framework for parameter estimation in combustion machine learning applications by maximizing the joint probability distribution of observed data given model parameters. The likelihood function L(θ|L) = Px|θ(x1=X1, x2=X2, ..., xN=XN|θ) represents the joint probability distribution of the data conditioned upon the parameterized probability distribution. When samples are independent, this simplifies to L(θ|L) = ∏Ni=1Px|θ(xi=Xi|θ). The maximum likelihood estimator is defined as θ̂_MLE = arg maxθ∈P L(θ|L), converting the inference problem into an optimization problem that can be solved using tools like gradient descent. The maximum likelihood estimator exhibits desirable statistical properties: it is consistent, unbiased, and invariant under transformation. Additionally, under some regularity conditions, the maximum likelihood estimator is normally distributed with a mean at the true population parameter and a variance inversely proportional to the estimated Fischer information. In practice, it's often more convenient to maximize the logarithm of the likelihood (log likelihood) since the logarithm is a monotonic function and this transformation simplifies subsequent calculations without affecting the estimator.",
