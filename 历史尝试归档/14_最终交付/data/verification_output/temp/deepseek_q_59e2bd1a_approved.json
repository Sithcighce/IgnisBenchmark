  "question_text": "Explain how pyrolysis temperature affects the structural evolution of biomass-derived carbon during carbonization, focusing on the stacking arrangements of graphene sheets and the relationship between temperature and crystallite growth patterns, as described in the provided paper.",
  "standard_answer": "Pyrolysis temperature significantly influences the structural evolution of biomass-derived carbon through thermal reorganization processes. At lower temperatures around 700°C, the poor stacking of C-C aromatic structures leads to the formation of micropores due to irregular arrangements. As temperature increases to the 600-1200°C range, hydrogen atoms are removed and the structural organization becomes more defined. Based on the nature of the carbon resource, the wrinkled graphite sheets stack either in a near-parallel fashion in regions called 'organized carbon' or arrange in a geometry resembling a 'house of cards'. The crystallite growth shows distinct temperature-dependent behavior where increasing carbonization temperature promotes more horizontal growth of pseudographitic structures rather than vertical growth. Consequently, at higher temperatures, the La value (basal-plane correlation length) becomes higher than the Lc value (c-axis correlation length), indicating preferential lateral expansion of graphitic domains over vertical stacking. This temperature-dependent structural evolution creates the characteristic microporous architecture of biomass-derived carbons with irregular cross-linked graphene sheets forming the interstices that define the pore structure.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "At this low temperature range (~700°C), the poor stacking of C-C aromatic structures can lead to the formation of micropores. In the second stage, at 600-1200°C, the H atoms are removed and, based on the nature of carbon resource, the wrinkled graphite sheets are stacked either in a near-parallel fashion in regions called 'organized carbon' or arranged in a geometry resembling a 'house of cards'.",
    "2": "Increasing the carbonization temperature will cause more horizontal growth of pseudographitic instead of vertical growth, therefore at higher temperature higher La value than Lc value is expected."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately reflects all key points from the original text. It correctly describes: (1) micropore formation at ~700°C due to poor stacking of C-C aromatic structures, (2) H atom removal in the 600-1200°C range, (3) the two stacking arrangements ('organized carbon' near-parallel fashion vs 'house of cards' geometry), (4) the temperature-dependent crystallite growth pattern showing preferential horizontal over vertical growth, and (5) the resulting relationship where La > Lc at higher temperatures. The answer also appropriately elaborates on the implications for pore structure formation, which is consistent with the mechanisms described in the original text. All physical principles are correctly stated, and there are no factual errors or logical contradictions.",
