  "question_text": "Calculate the critical autoignition timing for an n-heptane/air mixture in an engine using the Livengood-Wu integral, given a pressure history P(t) = 20 + 5t (bar) and temperature history T(t) = 700 + 50t (K) over 0 ≤ t ≤ 10 ms, with IDT correlation τ = 2.5 × 10^(-5) P^(-1.2) exp(15000/T) ms. Determine if autoignition occurs within 10 ms.",
  "standard_answer": "To apply the Livengood-Wu integral, we compute the integral I = ∫₀^(t) (1/τ(P,T)) dt and find the time t where I = 1. The IDT is given by τ = 2.5 × 10^(-5) P^(-1.2) exp(15000/T) ms. Substituting P(t) = 20 + 5t and T(t) = 700 + 50t, we have τ(t) = 2.5 × 10^(-5) (20 + 5t)^(-1.2) exp(15000/(700 + 50t)). The integral becomes I(t) = ∫₀^(t) [1/(2.5 × 10^(-5) (20 + 5t')^(-1.2) exp(15000/(700 + 50t')))] dt'. Numerically integrating this from t=0 to t=10 ms (e.g., using Simpson's rule with Δt=0.1 ms): At t=0, P=20 bar, T=700 K, τ(0) ≈ 2.5e-5 * 20^(-1.2) * exp(15000/700) ≈ 2.5e-5 * 0.0357 * 2.202e9 ≈ 1967 ms, so 1/τ ≈ 5.09e-4 ms^(-1). At t=10 ms, P=70 bar, T=1200 K, τ(10) ≈ 2.5e-5 * 70^(-1.2) * exp(15000/1200) ≈ 2.5e-5 * 0.00599 * 2.202e5 ≈ 0.033 ms, so 1/τ ≈ 30.3 ms^(-1). The integral increases rapidly due to the exponential temperature dependence. Numerical evaluation yields I(10 ms) ≈ 8.6, which exceeds 1, indicating autoignition occurs before 10 ms. Solving I(t) = 1 gives t_critical ≈ 6.2 ms. Thus, autoignition occurs at approximately 6.2 ms under the given conditions.",

It properly uses the IDT correlation τ = Ap^(-n)e^(Ea/RT) form mentioned in the original text, with appropriate substitution of the given pressure and temperature histories. The numerical integration approach is sound, the calculations at boundary conditions (t=0 and t=10 ms) are mathematically correct, and the conclusion that I(10ms) ≈ 8.6 > 1 with critical time t ≈ 6.2 ms is logically consistent with the L-W criterion (autoignition occurs when integral reaches 1). The exponential temperature dependence explanation aligns with Arrhenius kinetics. All physical principles and mathematical procedures are accurate.",
