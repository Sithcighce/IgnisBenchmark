  "question_text": "Why does the integration of CO2 in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis via the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction increase hydrogen consumption, and how do tandem catalysts optimize H2 utilization while maintaining high hydrocarbon yields?",
  "standard_answer": "Integrating CO2 into FTS requires the RWGS reaction (CO2 + H2 → CO + H2O), which consumes one H2 molecule per CO2 converted, before the standard FTS step (nCO + (2n+1)H2 → CnH2n+2 + nH2O). This additional H2 demand arises because CO2 is a fully oxidized carbon source, whereas CO is partially reduced. For direct CO2 hydrogenation to hydrocarbons (nCO2 + (3n+1)H2 → CnH2n+2 + 2nH2O), the stoichiometric H2/CO2 ratio is higher than for syngas-based FTS, increasing overall H2 consumption by approximately 45% for equivalent carbon output. Tandem catalysts optimize H2 utilization by co-localizing RWGS and FTS active sites (e.g., Fe-based catalysts with inherent WGS activity), where water produced in FTS drives RWGS equilibrium toward CO generation, reducing net H2 demand. Promoters like potassium enhance CO2 adsorption and dissociation, while zeolite components in mixed-bed configurations crack long chains, reducing the average chain length and thus the H2 required per carbon atom. This spatial and functional integration minimizes H2 waste by ensuring intermediates are rapidly converted before desorption.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly explains the increased H2 consumption in CO2-FTS via RWGS. It accurately presents the stoichiometric equations (RWGS: CO2 + H2 → CO + H2O, and direct CO2 hydrogenation: nCO2 + (3n+1)H2 → CnH2n+2 + 2nH2O), which is consistent with the original text equation [1]. The answer correctly identifies that CO2 is fully oxidized requiring more H2 than partially reduced CO. The explanation of tandem catalysts optimizing H2 utilization through co-localization of RWGS and FTS sites, water-driven equilibrium shifts, and the role of promoters and zeolites is chemically sound and logically consistent. The statement about ~45% increase in H2 consumption is reasonable given the stoichiometric comparison. The answer addresses both parts of the question (why H2 consumption increases and how tandem catalysts optimize it) with accurate thermochemical principles. While more detailed than the original text, all additional explanations are factually correct and do not contradict the ground truth.",

        "reasoning": "The answer correctly notes that integrating CO2 requires an RWGS step consuming H2 and that CO2 hydrogenation has higher H2 demand than CO-based FTS, consistent with the cited reaction. However, it contains key factual errors about RWGS equilibrium being driven forward by FTS-produced water (incorrect) and the effect of chain cracking on H2 demand (reversed trend). It also implies catalysts can reduce stoichiometric H2 demand, which is misleading. Therefore, the answer is not acceptable despite some correct elements.",

          "The answer incorrectly states that cracking long chains to shorter ones 'reduc[es] the average chain length and thus the H2 required per carbon atom'. For alkane synthesis via FTS (nCO + (2n+1)H2 → CnH2n+2 + nH2O), the H2/C ratio is (2n+1)/n. This value increases as n decreases, meaning shorter chains require *more* H2 per carbon atom, not less."
