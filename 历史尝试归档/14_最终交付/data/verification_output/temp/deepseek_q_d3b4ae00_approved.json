  "question_text": "Why does increasing pressure negatively affect methane conversion and benzene yield in methane dehydroaromatization (MDA), and how does this relate to the reaction's stoichiometry and equilibrium?",
  "standard_answer": "Increasing pressure reduces methane conversion and benzene yield in MDA due to the reaction's stoichiometry and Le Châtelier's principle. The global MDA reaction (6CH4 → C6H6 + 9H2) produces a net increase in moles (from 6 to 10 moles), making it favored at lower pressures. According to equilibrium thermodynamics, higher pressure shifts the equilibrium toward the reactant side to minimize volume expansion. Quantitatively, at 700°C and 1 bar, methane conversion is limited to around 12%, but increasing pressure to 4 bar decreases conversion to 7%, and at 10 bar it drops to approximately 5.5%. This pressure dependence stems from the ideal gas law and equilibrium constant expressions, where KP = (P_C6H6 * P_H2^9) / (P_CH4^6) for partial pressures, and increasing total pressure elevates reactant partial pressures more significantly due to the exponent differences. Additionally, higher pressures may accelerate undesired side reactions like naphthalene formation or coke deposition, further reducing selectivity.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly explains the pressure dependence of MDA using Le Châtelier's principle and stoichiometry (6 moles reactant → 10 moles product). The numerical values cited (12% conversion at 700°C/1 bar, 7% at 4 bar, 5.5% at 10 bar) match the original text exactly. The thermodynamic explanation via equilibrium constant expression KP is sound and correctly shows why higher pressure shifts equilibrium toward reactants. The mention of side reactions (naphthalene, coke) as additional factors is reasonable and doesn't contradict the original text. All physical principles are correctly stated, and the answer is consistent with the original text's assertion that 'increasing pressure actually compromises the performance of the reformation process.'",

          "Minor technical misstatement: \"increasing total pressure elevates reactant partial pressures more significantly due to the exponent differences\" is incorrect. Both reactant and product partial pressures scale with total pressure; the reaction quotient scales as P^(Δν)=P^4 because the product-side exponent sum (10) exceeds the reactant-side (6), which disfavors the forward reaction at higher pressure.",
          "The note about higher pressure accelerating side reactions (e.g., naphthalene or coke) is plausible but presented without support and is not required for the equilibrium-based explanation."
        ],
        "reasoning": "The answer correctly explains that the MDA stoichiometry (6CH4 → C6H6 + 9H2) increases total moles and thus is disfavored by higher pressure per Le Châtelier’s principle, aligning with equilibrium thermodynamics. It reproduces the quantitative trend from the cited text (conversion ~12% at 1 bar, ~7% at 4 bar, ~5.5% at 10 bar). The Kp expression is correct, though one explanatory clause about partial pressures is misstated; the correct rationale is that Qp scales as P^4, shifting equilibrium toward reactants at higher pressure. Overall, the core explanation and data are accurate and consistent with the ground truth.",
