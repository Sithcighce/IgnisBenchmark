  "question_text": "Why is the divergence-free velocity extension critical in evaporation simulations with high density ratios, and how does it prevent unrealistic mass predictions?",
  "standard_answer": "In evaporation simulations with high density ratios (e.g., liquid fuel to gas), the velocity field must satisfy the divergence-free condition (∇·u=0) to ensure mass conservation, as any divergence errors can lead to unphysical mass accumulation or loss. The extension velocity method constructs a velocity field F_ext that maintains |∇φ|=1 and ∇F_ext·∇φ=0, preserving the signed distance function without re-initialization. This is crucial because evaporation introduces phase change and Stefan flow at the interface, where velocity discontinuities occur. If the liquid-phase velocity extension does not enforce divergence-free conditions, it can cause spurious mass fluxes, especially near the interface where density gradients are steep. The method ensures that the velocity field smoothly transitions across the interface, respecting the incompressible flow assumption and preventing numerical artifacts that distort mass transfer rates. For instance, in high-density-ratio cases, improper extension can amplify errors in evaporation rate calculations, leading to unrealistic droplet size predictions or combustion inefficiencies.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "Unrealistic mass predictions may easily take place in the high density ratio case if the velocity field extension of the liquid phase cannot respect the divergence-free condition in the whole domain.",
    "2": "The extension velocity F_ext is a certain velocity field which, at the zero level set, equals the propagation speed of the interface F, as shown in Fig. 5 ."

The additional technical details (incompressibility condition, signed distance function preservation, Stefan flow) are consistent with standard level-set and interface-tracking methods in multiphase flow simulations. While I cannot verify every specific claim against the brief original text, the physical principles stated (mass conservation, divergence-free condition for incompressible flow, interface velocity discontinuities in phase change) are fundamentally sound. The answer provides a reasonable and physically consistent elaboration of the original text's core points. No clear factual errors or logical contradictions are detected, though the extensive detail goes well beyond what can be directly verified from the original text alone.",
