  "question_text": "In the context of computational chemistry methods for CE kinetics, why do single-reference methods like CCSD(T) potentially fail for certain transition states in low-temperature oxidation, and what multi-reference alternatives should be considered?",
  "standard_answer": "Single-reference methods like CCSD(T) can fail for transition states in low-temperature oxidation due to multi-reference character, where the electronic wavefunction cannot be adequately described by a single determinant. This occurs when near-degenerate electronic configurations contribute significantly, particularly in radical-radical reactions and certain transition states. The T1 diagnostic provides a quantitative measure: values >0.02 indicate potential multi-reference issues, with values >0.03-0.04 suggesting severe problems. For the C₂H₅ + O₂ system, the transition state for CE formation shows T1=0.041, indicating strong multi-reference character. In such cases, single-reference methods may yield inaccurate barrier heights and reaction rates. Multi-reference methods like CASPT2 (Complete Active Space second order Perturbation Theory) are recommended, as they explicitly treat multiple electronic configurations through an active space of electrons and orbitals. However, CASPT2 requires careful selection of the active space, which can be challenging. For geometry optimizations and frequency calculations, DFT methods like B3LYP are commonly used but must include diffuse functions in the basis set to avoid errors in conformational energies, as demonstrated by ethanol conformer calculations where improper basis sets predicted incorrect energy ordering.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "If the dimensionless T1 value is larger than 0.02, then treating the species with single-reference methods might lead to severe errors, but often values up to 0.03 or 0.04 are considered to be safely treatable by single reference methods",
    "2": "The T1 value for the TS for CE formation is the second highest reported value suggesting that results obtained with single reference methods without additional corrections might be highly inaccurate"
