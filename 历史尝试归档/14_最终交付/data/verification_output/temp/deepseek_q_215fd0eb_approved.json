  "question_text": "How does the incorporation of bulky chain extenders in polyurethane-urea membranes affect CO₂ permeability and plasticization resistance, and what is the relationship between fractional free volume, degree of phase separation, and glass transition temperature in this context?",
  "standard_answer": "The incorporation of bulky chain extenders in polyurethane-urea membranes enhances CO₂ permeability and plasticization resistance through specific structural modifications. Bulky chain extenders increase the fractional free volume and degree of phase separation while lowering the glass transition temperature, which collectively improves gas transport properties. The larger inter-chain spacing created by bulky groups in hard domains allows typically impermeable hard segments to contribute to gas transport pathways. This structural disruption prevents close packing and maintains membrane integrity under high CO₂ pressures, thereby resisting plasticization. The relationship between these parameters is demonstrated by experimental observations where membranes with bulkier chain extenders exhibit superior gas permeation correlated with higher fractional free volume, increased phase separation, and reduced glass transition temperatures. This combination of structural characteristics optimizes the permeability-selectivity trade-off while enhancing pressure stability in CO₂ separation applications.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately reflects the information in the original text and applies sound polymer science principles. It correctly identifies that bulky chain extenders lead to: (1) higher fractional free volume, (2) increased degree of phase separation (DPS), and (3) lower glass transition temperature (Tg), all of which correlate with enhanced CO₂ permeability. The explanation of how bulky groups create larger inter-chain spacing in hard domains, allowing them to contribute to gas transport pathways, is consistent with established polymer membrane science. The discussion of plasticization resistance through structural disruption preventing close packing is logically sound. The answer appropriately synthesizes the relationship between these structural parameters and their collective effect on gas transport properties, which aligns with the original text's statement that 'bulkier PUU membranes exhibited better gas permeation ability which is correlated to the higher DPS, larger fractional free volume, and lower Tg.' While the answer is more detailed than the original text, all elaborations are scientifically accurate and do not contradict the source material.",
