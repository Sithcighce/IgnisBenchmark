  "question_text": "How do infrequent bursts of black carbon production in flare plumes affect the statistical distribution of species concentration ratios, and what implications does this have for accurately measuring combustion efficiency?",
  "standard_answer": "Infrequent bursts of black carbon (BC) production in flare plumes create positively skewed statistical distributions in species concentration ratios like BC/H₂O. These bursts populate the long tail of the distribution and have an outsized influence on the mean value. The skewed distribution means that a single measurement would most probably return the mode of the distribution, which was approximately 13% less than the mean for both types of flare gas tested. This statistical behavior calls into question the assumption that species concentration ratios used to derive combustion efficiency are highly correlated and fixed. Inadequate sampling that misses these infrequent high-emission events would cause combustion efficiency estimates to be biased toward higher values, as the measurement would capture the more frequent low-emission periods while missing the bursts that substantially reduce global efficiency. The positive skewness observed in BC/H₂O ratios suggests that BC/CO₂ ratios would follow similar trends, introducing considerable uncertainty into measurements that assume fixed concentration ratios.",

    "1": "The infrequent bursts of BC production in laboratory-scale flare plumes [59], evidenced by the positive skewness in BC/H₂O ratios, are one such example. These bursts populate the distribution's long tail and have an outsized influence on the mean value",
    "2": "How do we capture rogue events in flaring and account for their impact on the global, time-integrated CE? The solution may lie in coupling experimental measurements taken at higher spatial resolution over longer time frames"

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately captures the key points from the original text: (1) infrequent BC bursts create positively skewed distributions in BC/H₂O ratios, (2) these bursts populate the long tail and disproportionately influence the mean, (3) the mode is approximately 13% less than the mean, and (4) inadequate sampling missing these bursts would bias combustion efficiency estimates toward higher values. The answer correctly extends the logic to explain why single measurements would likely capture the mode rather than the mean, and appropriately infers that BC/CO₂ ratios would show similar behavior. The physical reasoning about statistical distributions and their implications for combustion efficiency measurements is sound and consistent with the original text. While the answer is detailed, all statements are factually accurate and logically coherent.",

It correctly identifies that infrequent bursts of black carbon lead to a positively skewed distribution of species ratios, where the mean is significantly influenced by rare, high-emission events.
