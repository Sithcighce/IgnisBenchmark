  "question_text": "What physical mechanisms cause concentration jumps at fluid-solid interfaces in porous media mass transport, and how do these jumps affect the interfacial boundary conditions in pore-scale modeling?",
  "standard_answer": "Concentration jumps at fluid-solid interfaces arise from thermodynamic equilibrium conditions governed by Henry's Law, where the solute concentration in the solid phase (Cs) relates to the fluid phase concentration (Cf) through Cs = Cf/H, with H being the Henry constant. This creates a discontinuity C_jump = Cs - Cf = Cf(1/H - 1). The jump affects mass conservation by introducing additional flux terms at the interface. The complete interfacial conditions become: Cf = Cs + C_jump for concentration continuity and -Df∂Cf/∂nf = Ds∂Cs/∂ns + q_jump for flux continuity, where q_jump represents any additional interfacial flux from reactions or adsorption. In pore-scale modeling, these conditions require specialized numerical schemes that can handle both the concentration discontinuity and potential flux jumps. The lattice Boltzmann method addresses this through modified streaming operations that incorporate both Henry's constant (σ = Ds/Df) and jump parameters, ensuring accurate prediction of mass transfer resistance across interfaces, which is particularly important in electrochemical devices where interfacial transport dominates overall performance.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "Unlike heat transfer where the temperature is continuous across the interface, for mass transport, according to the Henry's law, the concentration is not continuous at the interface of different constituents, and this discontinuity is termed as the concentration jump.",
    "2": "The interfacial conjugate conditions for concentration are given as Cf = Cs + Cjump and -Df∂Cf/∂nf = Ds∂Cs/∂ns + qjump"

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly explains concentration jumps at fluid-solid interfaces in porous media. It accurately states that these jumps arise from thermodynamic equilibrium governed by Henry's Law (Cs = Cf/H), correctly derives the concentration jump expression C_jump = Cf(1/H - 1), and properly presents the interfacial boundary conditions that match the original text: Cf = Cs + Cjump for concentration and -Df∂Cf/∂nf = Ds∂Cs/∂ns + qjump for flux. The answer also correctly notes the discontinuity differs from heat transfer (where temperature is continuous), consistent with the original text. The additional discussion of numerical schemes, lattice Boltzmann methods, and electrochemical applications, while more detailed than the original text, represents valid extensions and applications of the core principles without introducing factual errors or contradictions.",
