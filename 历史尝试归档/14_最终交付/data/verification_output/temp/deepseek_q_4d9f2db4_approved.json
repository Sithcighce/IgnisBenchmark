  "question_text": "Why are ammonia/air flames more susceptible to heat loss and local extinction compared to hydrocarbon flames, and how do properties like quenching distance and extinction stretch rate contribute to this behavior?",
  "standard_answer": "Ammonia/air flames are more susceptible to heat loss and local extinction due to their inherently low reactivity, slow laminar flame speed, and large flame thickness. The quenching distance (δQ) for NH3/air flames is significantly larger than for hydrocarbons—approximately an order of magnitude greater than CH4/air flames. This larger δQ implies a thicker thermal boundary layer where heat conduction to walls or cold surfaces is enhanced, leading to greater heat loss. The relationship δQ = ΔT·λ / Qw shows that for similar gas thermal conductivity (λ) and temperature difference (ΔT), a larger δQ results in a lower maximum wall heat flux (Qw), making the flame more vulnerable to quenching. Additionally, the extinction stretch rate (Kext) for NH3/air flames is lower, meaning they cannot withstand high strain rates before extinguishing. In turbulent flows, small-scale vortices impose stretch that can locally extinguish NH3 flames more easily than CH4 flames. The combination of large δQ and low Kext means ammonia flames have poor resistance to both conductive heat loss and aerodynamic stretching, necessitating careful combustor design to minimize cooling surfaces and manage flow strain in swirl stabilizers.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "The quenching distance relates to maximum wall heat flux by δQ = ΔT⋅λ/Qw ... δQ of NH3/air flame is an order of magnitude larger than that of CH4/air flame, indicating the maximum wall heat flux is much smaller for NH3/air flame, which can be easily affected by wall heat loss.",
    "2": "The flame is more prone to be locally extinguished by turbulence due to the lower extinction stretch rate, since the resistance of the flame to turbulence is low."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately explains why ammonia/air flames are more susceptible to heat loss and local extinction. It correctly cites that δQ for NH3/air is an order of magnitude larger than CH4/air, properly applies the relationship δQ = ΔT·λ/Qw to explain that larger δQ results in lower maximum wall heat flux (making the flame more vulnerable to quenching), and correctly states that lower extinction stretch rate (Kext) means NH3 flames cannot withstand high strain rates. The answer appropriately connects these properties to practical implications (thicker thermal boundary layer, enhanced heat conduction, vulnerability to turbulent stretching). All physical principles are correctly stated, the cause-effect relationships are sound, and the explanation is consistent with the original text from the PECS review. The additional context provided (slow laminar flame speed, large flame thickness, turbulent flow effects, design considerations) represents reasonable elaboration that does not contradict the source material.",

          "Internal inconsistency: the answer first says heat conduction to walls is enhanced with larger δQ, but later correctly states (via δQ = ΔT·λ/Qw) that larger δQ leads to lower maximum wall heat flux."
        ],
        "reasoning": "The answer correctly identifies that NH3/air flames have larger quenching distance and lower extinction stretch rate, consistent with the original text, and properly uses the relation δQ = ΔT·λ/Qw to explain increased vulnerability to wall heat loss. However, it incorrectly asserts that a thicker thermal boundary layer enhances heat conduction to walls, which contradicts both the cited relation and basic heat-transfer scaling, leading to a logical contradiction within the answer.",
