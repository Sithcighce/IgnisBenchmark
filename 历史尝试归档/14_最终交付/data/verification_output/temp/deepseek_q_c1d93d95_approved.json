Include specific reaction sequences and temperature regimes as supported by the paper.",
  "standard_answer": "The paper identifies two distinct chain-branching pathways that dominate hydrocarbon combustion at different temperature regimes. At low temperatures (below approximately 750 K), the dominant pathway is the peroxy chemistry sequence: R → RO₂ → QOOH → O₂QOOH → OQ'O + 2OH. This pathway involves sequential oxygen additions and decompositions that produce multiple OH radicals, driving the partial fuel oxidation and limited temperature rise characteristic of cool flames. The key reactions include fuel radical (R) formation via H-abstraction, O₂ addition to form RO₂, internal isomerization to QOOH, second O₂ addition to form O₂QOOH, and subsequent decompositions that yield ketohydroperoxide and ultimately produce two OH radicals. At high temperatures (above approximately 1050 K), the dominant chain-branching pathway shifts to H + O₂ = OH + O, which provides rapid radical multiplication that sustains hot flames with complete fuel oxidation and significant temperature increases. The chemical difference lies in the molecular complexity: low-temperature pathways involve large, fuel-sized molecules and sequential oxygen additions, while high-temperature pathways focus on small radical interactions. These distinct pathways govern flame transitions as temperature increases: low-temperature chemistry becomes suppressed due to faster decomposition of intermediates and reverse reactions, allowing high-temperature chemistry to take over, explaining the transition from cool flames to hot flames observed in staged ignition processes.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately describes both chain-branching pathways from the original text. It correctly identifies the low-temperature pathway (R → RO₂ → QOOH → O₂QOOH → OQ'O + 2OH) and high-temperature pathway (H + O₂ = OH + O), provides appropriate temperature regimes (~750 K for low-temp, ~1050 K for high-temp), explains the chemical differences (large fuel-sized molecules with sequential O₂ additions vs. small radical interactions), and correctly describes their roles in cool flame vs. hot flame formation. The mechanistic details about peroxy chemistry, internal isomerization, and the transition between regimes are all consistent with established combustion science principles and the original text. The answer is detailed but contains no factual errors or logical contradictions.",
