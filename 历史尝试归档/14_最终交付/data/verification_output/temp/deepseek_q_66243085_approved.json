  "question_text": "What are the fundamental thermodynamic principles governing open-circuit voltage (OCV) behavior in Li-ion cells, and how do phase transformations in electrode materials affect the OCV-SoC relationship?",
  "standard_answer": "The OCV of Li-ion cells is governed by thermodynamic principles described by the Nernst equation: E = E₀ - (RT/ze)log(a⁺/a⁻), where E₀ is the standard redox potential, a⁺ and a⁻ are chemical activities of positive and negative electrodes. The full-cell OCV is determined by the difference between positive and negative electrode potentials, modified by loading ratio and offset parameters. Phase transformations in electrode materials significantly affect OCV behavior through their impact on Gibbs free energy. During phase transformations, the system exhibits voltage plateaus because the Gibbs free energy of the pure reaction remains constant while two phases coexist. In solid solution regions, the voltage varies continuously with composition as the Gibbs free energy changes. Materials undergoing multiple phase transformations display characteristic voltage signatures with alternating plateaus and sloping regions. The specific electrochemical response depends on transition metal redox couples, atomic structure, and counter ions. The OCV-SoC relationship also changes with temperature due to shifts in phase transformation boundaries and entropic effects, though these changes are typically minimal for most commercial cell chemistries.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "At the full-cell level, the OCV vs. SoC curve is defined by the OCV curves of both active electrodes and two other significant parameters: the loading ratio that relates the capacity of the PE with respect to the NE and an offset that takes into consideration eventual SoC shifts between the electrodes",
    "2": "Phase transformations present a voltage plateau because there is a mixture of two phases which convolute, and thus ΔG⁰ remains constant. The voltage of solid solutions varies with the composition because the Gibbs free energy of a pure reaction changes with the composition"

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly explains the thermodynamic principles governing OCV in Li-ion cells. The Nernst equation formulation is appropriate for electrochemical systems. The answer accurately describes how full-cell OCV depends on both electrode potentials, loading ratio, and offset parameters, which aligns with the original text [1]. The explanation of phase transformations is consistent with [2]: voltage plateaus occur during two-phase coexistence because ΔG⁰ remains constant, while solid solution regions show varying voltage due to composition-dependent Gibbs free energy changes. The additional details about temperature effects and transition metal redox couples, while not in the original text excerpts, are scientifically sound elaborations that don't contradict the provided information. All core mechanisms are correctly explained with no factual errors or logical contradictions.",

        ],
        "reasoning": "The answer aligns with the ground-truth statements: full-cell OCV arises from the difference between electrode potentials and is shaped by loading ratio and SoC offset; two-phase regions yield voltage plateaus due to constant Gibbs free energy, while solid solutions give sloped regions. However, it contains a factual/units error in the Nernst expression by using RT/(ze) instead of RT/(zF) (or equivalently kT/(ze)). This constitutes a clear factual mistake, so the answer cannot be accepted as fully correct.",
