  "question_text": "How does the oxophilicity of metal carbide surfaces like Mo₂C influence selective C–O bond cleavage in biomass-derived oxygenates, and what molecular mechanisms explain this selectivity based on spectroscopic evidence?",
  "standard_answer": "The high oxophilicity of Mo₂C surfaces, characterized by elevated oxygen binding energy (OBE), promotes selective C–O bond cleavage over C–C scission in oxygenated biomass molecules through specific molecular mechanisms. HREEL spectra of adsorbed ethylene glycol (EG) at 100 K on both Mo₂C and 1 monolayer (ML) Ni-covered Mo₂C surfaces show the absence of ν(OH) (3085 cm⁻¹) and τ(OH) (744 cm⁻¹) bands, indicating the formation of an ethylenedioxy species (–O–CH₂–CH₂–O–) in both cases. This suggests strong surface-oxygen interactions that stabilize oxygen-containing intermediates. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations of atomic binding energies reveal that Mo₂C has a similar carbon binding energy (CBE = 736 kJ/mol) to common reforming catalysts like Pt (690 kJ/mol), but a much higher OBE (674 kJ/mol vs. less than 400 kJ/mol), indicating that oxophilicity is a key descriptor for deoxygenation activity. The strong oxygen binding facilitates preferential adsorption through oxygen atoms, lowering activation barriers for C–O bond rupture while preserving C–C bonds, as evidenced by the persistence of C–C vibrational modes in HREELS studies.",

The answer provides reasonable elaboration on the molecular mechanisms (preferential oxygen adsorption, lower activation barriers for C-O cleavage, preservation of C-C bonds) that logically follow from the high oxophilicity. These mechanistic interpretations are consistent with established surface chemistry principles and do not contradict the original text.

        "reasoning": "The answer accurately reflects the ground-truth points: Mo2C’s high OBE indicates strong oxophilicity, which is a descriptor for deoxygenation activity; HREELS absence of OH bands indicates ethylenedioxy formation on Mo2C and Ni/Mo2C; DFT values for CBE and OBE match. The mechanistic inference that strong O binding promotes O-anchored intermediates and lowers barriers for C–O cleavage while avoiding C–C scission is logically consistent. Only minor overreach is the claim about C–C vibrational mode persistence, which is not stated in the provided source.",
