  "question_text": "What is the physical significance of the Q-terms in the strongly stretched flamelet equations, and under what combustion conditions do they become non-negligible?",
  "standard_answer": "The Q-terms in the strongly stretched flamelet equations represent transport processes along flame surfaces due to gradients of scalar quantities (enthalpy, species mass fractions, element mass fractions) tangential to the flame front. Physically, they account for conduction/diffusion parallel to the flame surfaces when local iso-surfaces of these scalars are not aligned with the progress variable iso-surfaces. These terms become significant when: (1) the flame is partially premixed, creating mixture fraction gradients along flame surfaces; (2) heat loss mechanisms create enthalpy gradients along flame surfaces (e.g., flame stabilization near burners); or (3) when the characteristic length scale of tangential gradients becomes comparable to or smaller than the flame thickness (∇_tZ_j ~ 1/δ_f). In fully premixed adiabatic flames, Q-terms are typically negligible compared to stretch and reaction terms, but in stratified flames or flames with strong heat loss, the scalar dissipation rate along flame surfaces makes Q-terms physically important for accurate flame structure prediction.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "The Q-terms in Eq. (29) describe conduction/diffusion along the flame surfaces and are presumably small.",
    "2": "When the typical length scale of the gradient is comparable to or smaller than the flame thickness (e.g., ∇_tZ_j ~ 1/δ_f), then the Q-term cannot be neglected."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly identifies Q-terms as representing transport processes along flame surfaces due to tangential gradients, which aligns with the original text's description of 'conduction/diffusion along the flame surfaces.' The answer accurately states the condition for non-negligibility: when tangential gradient length scales become comparable to or smaller than flame thickness (∇_tZ_j ~ 1/δ_f), which directly matches the original text. The additional physical context provided (partially premixed flames, heat loss, stratified flames) represents valid elaboration on when such tangential gradients would arise, without contradicting the original text. The statement that Q-terms are 'presumably small' in the original text is consistent with the answer's claim that they are 'typically negligible' in fully premixed adiabatic flames. All physical principles are correctly stated.",

It also accurately gives the non-negligibility condition when the tangential gradient length scale is comparable to or less than the flame thickness (∇_tZ_j ~ 1/δ_f).
