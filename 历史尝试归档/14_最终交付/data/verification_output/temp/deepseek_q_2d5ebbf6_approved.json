  "question_text": "Using thermodynamic principles from combustion science and fluid mechanics, explain how CO2+N2 mixtures enhance CH4 recovery efficiency in natural gas hydrate reservoirs compared to pure CO2 injection, focusing specifically on the cavity occupation mechanism and recovery percentages supported by experimental evidence.",
  "standard_answer": "The enhanced CH4 recovery efficiency with CO2+N2 mixtures is primarily due to the distinct cavity occupation behavior in structure I (sI) hydrates and synergistic thermodynamic effects. Experimental studies show that N2 and CO2 occupy different hydrate cavities during the replacement process: N2 molecules preferentially occupy the small (512) cavities, while CO2 occupies the large (51262) cavities of sI hydrate. This complementary occupation maximizes cavity utilization and facilitates more efficient CH4 displacement. The inclusion of N2 can increase CH4 recovery from 64% to approximately 85%, demonstrating significant improvement over pure CO2 injection. From a thermodynamic perspective, the mixture adjusts the system's phase behavior, potentially expanding the operating window between CO2 hydrate formation and CH4 hydrate decomposition conditions. The different molecular sizes and hydrate formation characteristics of N2 and CO2 create a more favorable driving force for replacement, where N2 destabilizes CH4 hydrate structures while CO2 fills the liberated cavities, leading to higher recovery rates without requiring additional energy-intensive processes.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "The inclusion of N2 can increase the CH4 recovery from 64% to approximately 85% but the injection approach with the aim of ocean storage needs pure CO2 (without N2).",
    "2": "N2 and CO2 occupy the small and large cavities of sI hydrate, respectively, during the replacement process."

The answer provides additional thermodynamic context and mechanistic explanations that are consistent with established combustion science and hydrate thermodynamics principles. The explanation of complementary cavity occupation, synergistic effects, and the thermodynamic driving forces are logically sound and do not contradict the original text.
