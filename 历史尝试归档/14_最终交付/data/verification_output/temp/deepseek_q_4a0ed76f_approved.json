  "question_text": "Calculate the heating efficiency for a battery-powered air heating system where a 2.2 Ah cylindrical cell with mass 45g and specific heat 1100 J/kg·K experiences a temperature rise from -20°C to 20°C in 201 seconds, with internal heat generation rate of 2.5W and output power to external heater of 8W.",
  "standard_answer": "To calculate the heating efficiency η, we apply the formula: η = (c_pC m_C dT_C/dt) / (q̇_C + P_out). First, determine the temperature rise rate: dT_C/dt = (20 - (-20)) / 201 = 40/201 = 0.199 °C/s. The mass m_C = 0.045 kg, specific heat c_pC = 1100 J/kg·K. The numerator becomes: c_pC m_C dT_C/dt = 1100 × 0.045 × 0.199 = 9.85 W. The denominator is the total power consumption: q̇_C + P_out = 2.5 + 8 = 10.5 W. Therefore, the heating efficiency η = 9.85 / 10.5 = 0.938 or 93.8%. This high efficiency indicates effective thermal management, though in practical systems, additional heat losses to the environment would reduce this value. The calculation demonstrates that battery-powered heating can achieve high efficiency when properly designed, with most electrical energy converted to useful thermal energy for battery warm-up.",
