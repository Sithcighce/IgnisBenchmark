  "question_text": "Calculate the theoretical specific capacity of a lignin-derived carbon anode assuming it operates solely by intercalation mechanism with a graphitic structure, and compare it to experimental values from the paper. What factors account for any discrepancies?",
  "standard_answer": "The theoretical specific capacity for a graphitic carbon anode via intercalation is based on the formation of LiC6, giving a capacity of 372 mAh g−1. For lignin-derived carbons, experimental values often exceed this (e.g., 520 mAh g−1), indicating additional storage mechanisms. The discrepancy arises because lignin-derived carbons are typically hard carbons with turbostratic structures, not perfect graphite. Hard carbons have disordered layers with larger interlayer spacing, allowing more lithium insertion sites and additional capacity from pore filling and surface adsorption. Specifically, micropores in activated lignin carbons can store lithium ions through adsorption, contributing pseudocapacitance. Functional groups and defects from heteroatom doping (e.g., nitrogen, sulfur) create extra active sites for lithium binding. For example, nitrogen doping improves electronic conductivity and introduces defects that enhance reversible capacity. The calculation neglects these contributions, so experimental capacities are higher due to combined intercalation, adsorption, and pseudocapacitive effects. In the paper, capacities up to 520 mAh g−1 are achieved with K2CO3-activated lignin carbon, where high surface area and hierarchical pores amplify non-intercalation storage.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "a much higher capacity of 470 mAh g−1 was achieved for the cell with the LHPC anode compared to that of pristine carbonized lignin anode (180 mAh g−1)",
    "2": "The cells with ALC-K2CO3 anodes could maintain reversible capacities of 520 and 260 mAh g−1 after 200 cycles at current densities of 200 and 1000 mA g-1, respectively."

The cited experimental values (520 mAh g−1 for K2CO3-activated lignin carbon) match the original text.
