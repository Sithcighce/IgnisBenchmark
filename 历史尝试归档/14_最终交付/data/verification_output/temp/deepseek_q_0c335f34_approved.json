  "question_text": "How does H2S poisoning affect the electrochemical performance of Ni-based SOFC anodes through competitive adsorption mechanisms at the triple-phase boundary?",
  "standard_answer": "H2S poisoning severely degrades Ni-based SOFC anode performance through competitive adsorption mechanisms. H2S molecules adsorb strongly on Ni active sites, displacing hydrogen adsorption and reducing the triple-phase boundary area where electrochemical reactions occur. This competitive adsorption follows Langmuir-type behavior where H2S coverage increases with concentration, effectively blocking sites for hydrogen oxidation. The displacement of hydrogen from active sites directly impacts the electrochemical performance by reducing the available surface area for the hydrogen oxidation reaction. This adsorption-driven degradation mechanism occurs even at trace contaminant levels and is particularly detrimental because it affects the critical triple-phase boundary regions where ionic conduction, electronic conduction, and gas transport converge for efficient electrochemical conversion.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately describes H2S poisoning mechanisms in Ni-based SOFC anodes and is fully consistent with the original text. Key points verified: (1) H2S severely degrades performance through competitive adsorption, (2) H2S adsorbs strongly on Ni sites displacing hydrogen, (3) reduces triple-phase boundary area for electrochemical reactions. The answer appropriately elaborates on Langmuir-type adsorption behavior and the importance of triple-phase boundary regions, which are scientifically sound extensions consistent with SOFC fundamentals. The mention of 'trace contaminant levels' and detailed explanation of triple-phase boundary function (ionic/electronic conduction and gas transport convergence) represent valid additional context that doesn't contradict the original text. No factual errors, logical inconsistencies, or contradictions detected.",
