  "question_text": "Using the thermodynamic equilibrium data from the provided paper, explain why the reverse water-gas shift reaction (RWGS) significantly affects the hydrogen concentration in syngas during dry reforming of methane at 800°C and 1 bar with equimolar CH₄ and CO₂ feed. Describe how this side reaction alters the expected H₂/CO ratio compared to the ideal DRM stoichiometry, and quantify the thermodynamic driving forces for both DRM and RWGS at this temperature based on the equilibrium constants provided.",
  "standard_answer": "According to the paper, the dry reforming of methane (DRM: CH₄ + CO₂ ⇌ 2CO + 2H₂) and reverse water-gas shift (RWGS: CO₂ + H₂ ⇌ CO + H₂O) are both equilibrium-limited reactions that occur simultaneously at 800°C. The paper states: 'Full conversion of CH₄ and CO₂ is obtained at temperature above 800°C' (Citation 1), indicating that thermodynamics favor complete reactant conversion. However, the RWGS reaction 'is often responsible for lower hydrogen concentration in the syngas due to its consumption of part of the H₂ produced to reduce CO₂ to CO' (Citation 2). At 800°C, Figure 2 in the paper shows that both DRM and RWGS have positive equilibrium constants (ln(K) > 0), meaning both reactions proceed forward. The ideal DRM stoichiometry would yield H₂/CO = 1, but RWGS consumes H₂ to produce additional CO and H₂O, lowering the H₂ concentration and increasing the CO concentration. This shifts the H₂/CO ratio below 1. The simultaneous equilibrium of both reactions means that even with complete CH₄ and CO₂ conversion, the final gas composition reflects a balance between DRM producing H₂ and RWGS consuming it. The thermodynamic driving force is substantial for both reactions at 800°C, as evidenced by their equilibrium constants being greater than 1, but RWGS actively reduces the hydrogen yield from the theoretical maximum.",

        ],
        "reasoning": "The answer correctly explains the core mechanism: DRM and RWGS occur simultaneously at 800°C, RWGS consumes H₂ to produce CO and H₂O (lowering H₂/CO ratio below the ideal 1:1), and both reactions are thermodynamically favorable above 800°C. These points are consistent with the original text citations. However, the answer makes specific claims about Figure 2 and equilibrium constant values that cannot be verified from the provided original text excerpts. The fundamental chemistry and thermodynamics are correct (RWGS: CO₂ + H₂ → CO + H₂O consuming hydrogen, both reactions proceeding forward at high temperature), and the logical reasoning about H₂/CO ratio deviation is sound. The unverifiable claims about Figure 2 are presented as supporting evidence rather than core arguments, so they don't invalidate the main explanation, but they do introduce uncertainty about complete accuracy.",
