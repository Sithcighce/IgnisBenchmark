Diesel engines are preferred over spark ignition counterparts for heavy-duty applications and power gen-
eration plants because of their higher efficiency, durability, and productivity. Currently, the research inter-
ests have been propelled towards renewable and sustainable diesel fuels such as biodiesel in order to ad-
dress the environmental and energy security challenges associated with these energy systems. However,
the most challenging issue concerning large-scale production of biodiesel is its relatively high cost over
fossil-based diesel owing to high feedstock and manufacturing costs. Therefore, cost-effective and eco-
friendly biodiesel production technologies should be necessarily developed and continuously improved in
order to make this biofuel more competitive vs. its petroleum counterpart. Accordingly, this paper com-
prehensively reviews biodiesel manufacturing techniques from natural oils and fats using conventional
and advanced technologies with an in-depth state-of-the-art focus on the utmost important unit, i.e .,
transesterification reactor. The effects of the main influential parameters on the transesterification process
are first discussed in detail in order to better understand the mechanisms behind each reactor technol-
ogy. Different transesterification reactors; e.g. , tubular/plug-flow reactors, rotating reactors, simultaneous
reaction-separation reactors, cavitational reactors, and microwave reactors are then scrutinized from the
scientific and practical viewpoints. Merits and limitations of each reactor technology for biodiesel produc-
tion are highlighted to guide future R&D on this topic. At the end of the paper, the sustainability aspects
of biodiesel production are comprehensively discussed by emphasizing on the biorefinery concept utiliz-
ing waste-oriented oils.

1. Biodiesel production

1.1. Physical approaches

Biodiesel (the most attractive biofuel types) as a biodegradable,
sustainable,  clean-burning,  and  nontoxic  transportation  fuel  has
gained a lot of interest in recent years [1–3] . In fact, this green fuel
has gradually become more economical and widely used in many
regions of the world due to the implementation of subsidiaries and
tax  exemptions.  In  order  to  further  boost  the  economic  benefits
of biodiesel industry, glycerol as the main by-product of biodiesel
production plants, which amounts to approx. 10 wt.% of the pro-
duction volume, can be valorized into combustion improvers for
diesel/biodiesel, such as solketal, solketalacetin, and acetins [4–6] .
In spite of these effort s, the production cost of biodiesel has still
remained a challenge toward its commercialization and industrial-
ization phases as well as competition with fossil fuels [7] . Biodiesel
highly resembles diesel fuel in terms of cetane number, density,
and viscosity [7–9] . Chemically, biodiesel is an alkyl ester (mostly
fatty acid methyl ester abbreviated as FAME) of long chain fatty
acids  (C14–C24)  synthesized  from  various  renewable  lipid  feed-
stocks such as vegetable oils and animal fats [10–12] . It is notewor-
thy that natural oils and fats can be used either in modified diesel
engines in their neat form (direct use and blending as well as mi-
croemulsion;  also  known  as  physical  approaches)  or  in  existing
diesel engines in chemically modified form (pyrolysis and trans-
esterification; also known as chemical approaches) [13,14] . Table 1
compares these techniques with respect to their advantages and
disadvantages.

In  physical  methods,  specific  proportions  of  diesel  fuel  and
other additives are employed to improve viscosity and volatility of
natural oils. Since the chemical characteristics of natural oils re-
mains unchanged, inherent problems of straight natural oil persist
as discussed in the subsequent section.

Direct  use  and  blending.  The  combustion  of  vegetable  oils  as
diesel fuel was coined in 1893 when Rudolph Diesel, the German
inventor  of  diesel  engine,  examined  peanut  oil  in  his  compres-
sion  engine  [15] .  Although  the  application  of  vegetable  oils  was
completely boycotted due to higher availability and lower cost of
petrol-diesel in 1920, researchers again suggested the possibilities
of  fueling  diesel  engines  with  natural  oils  in  1980.  Brazilian  re-
searchers successfully powered pre-combustion chamber diesel en-
gines  with  no  adjustments  using  a  diesel  blend  containing  10%
sunflower oil. The application of up to 50% vegetable oil in diesel
was tested by different scientists as well. In 1982, the first inter-
national conference on plant and vegetable oils as fuels was held
to consider various aspects of using vegetable oil directly in diesel.
These included oil production (oilseed processing and oil extrac-
tion) and fuel preparation methods to determine fuel cost, spec-
ifications, and impact on engine performance and durability. Ad-
ditionally, waste cooking oil (WCO) was filtered and mixed with
5% diesel fuel to run a diesel fleet [16–18] . Although this cheap
diesel fuel contained high thermal efficiency and no carbon build-
up issue (coking), the blend required pre-heating for liquefaction

at  cold  temperatures  and  also  contaminated  lubricating  oil.  The
viscosity of lubricating oil was increased to the point of replace-
ment after every 6440–7240 km because of the polymerization of
polyunsaturated vegetable oils. Finally, it was concluded that some
properties of vegetable oils including gum formation, high density,
high FFA content, high viscosity, low volatility, lubricating oil thick-
ening, and unsaturated hydrocarbon chains reactivity make direct
application of pure vegetable in diesel engines inappropriate and
impractical  [19] .  If  engine  remains  unmodified,  these  drawbacks
lead  to  inappropriate  fuel  combustion,  injector  nozzles  plugging,
poor  atomization,  engine  durability  reduction,  higher  air  pollu-
tion emission, higher engine maintenance costs, and higher engine
wear.

Microemulsion.  The  viscosity  of  vegetable  oil  and  its  low  liq-
uidity as well as high nitrogen oxide (NO x ) emissions of biodiesel
can be improved through microemulsification without formation of
by-product and waste. This method is classified into two groups,
i.e. ,  water  in  oil  and  Winsor  Type  II  and  involves  mixing  mi-
croemulsions,  solvents,  or  surfactants  with  animal  fats  and  veg-
etable oils to produce a clear, single phase, and thermodynamically
stable  colloidal  equilibrium  dispersion  of  optically  isotropic  fluid
with micro-structures (1–150 nm in size) and droplet diameter of
10–100 nm [18] . Different solvents including 1-butanol, 2-octanol,
butanol, ethanol, hexanol, and methanol can be applied in prepara-
tion of microemulsions, with or without diesel fuel. A microemul-
sion  comprising  of  soybean  oil,  2-octanol,  methanol,  and  cetane
improver (52.7:33.3:13.3:1.0) has been already approved by 200 h
Engine Manufacturers Association test [20] . Moreover, when short-
term performance is considered, ionic and non-ionic microemul-
sions prepared by mixing ethanol with soybean oil have qualities
close to No. 2 diesel fuel.

Nguyen  et  al.  [21]  extracted  peanut  oil  (95%  efficiency,
10 min,  room  temperature)  using  diesel-based  reverse-micellar

microemulsions to produce a peanut oil/diesel mixture that met
the biodiesel fuel standards. Najjar and Heidari [22] formulated a
nine-month  stable,  low  viscosity  microemulsions  containing  wa-
ter  droplets  of  4.6 nm  by  blending  1-butanol  as  co-surfactant
with  diesel/colza  oil  (4:1 w/w),  water,  and  Span  80  surfactant
(47:44:5:4 wt.%). The addition of diethylene glycol ethyl ether and
ethyl acetate improved the fuel properties while considerably low-
ered the emissions of CO and NO x of microemulsion biofuels made
from  diesel/palm  oil  (1:1  v/v),  ethanol,  as  well  as  some  surfac-
tants and co-surfactants [23] . An ecofriendly microemulsion biofuel
with comparable fuel properties with biodiesel was generated by
blending sorbitan monooleate (a sugar-based surfactant) and oc-
tanol  (1:8  molar  ratio)  with  palm  oil  [24] .  A  number  of  studies
produced bio-oil via thermochemical liquefaction (250–350 °C, 5–
10 MPa) of sludges and subsequently mixed it with various solvents
(such as biodiesel, diesel, ethanol, methanol) and surfactants (such
as rhamnolipid) to produce diesel fuel microemulsion, represent-
ing better cold flow properties, improved stability and solubility,
reduced activation energy, satisfactory viscosity, and shorter igni-
tion  delay  [25,26] .  However,  microemulsification  of  oils  must  be
further improved to address heavy deposition of carbon residue,
inadequate combustion, increased viscosity of lubricating oils, and
random injector needle sticking.

1.2. Chemical approaches

These methods modify the chemical nature of natural oils and

fats itself for its better exploitation in fuel industry.

Pyrolysis. This is a thermochemical process applying heat (300–
700 °C or higher) to convert various feedstocks into value-added
chemical species (such as energy carriers) under anoxic condition
at atmospheric pressure [27] . More specifically, this technique al-
lows the degradation of animal fat, methyl esters of fatty acids, or

242

vegetable oil into a fuel resembling diesel fuels under a predefined
process duration with or without catalyst. Pyrolysis of oils is par-
ticularly suitable for areas with well-established hydro-processing
industry  due  to  its  similarity  to  conventional  petroleum  refining
method [28,29] . A second generation biofuel was synthesized from
pyrolysis-treated WCO (800 °C, 15 °C/min) to yield 80 wt.% bio-oil
with a high heating value of 8843 kg/kcal. The by-products of this
process, i.e., syngas and biochar could also be conveniently con-
sumed as energy source for the pyrolysis reactor and iron-rich fer-
tilizer, respectively [30] .

Abdelfattah et al. [31] synthesized castor-based diesel fuel via
pyrolysis of crude castor oil in presence of 1% v/v NaOH and ZMS-
5 as catalysts. The resultant diesel fuel showed satisfactory phys-
ical and chemical properties and was suitable as 5–10% blend in
diesel to run single cylinder four stroke direct injection compres-
sion ignition engine. In another study, a high energy (42–49 MJ/kg),
low nitrogen and oxygen, sulfur-free liquid oil with C13–C24 hy-
drocarbons was obtained through microwave co-pyrolysis of WCO
and waste polyolefins under vacuum (20–25 °C/min, 62 wt.% yield)
[32] . Despite the high versatility of pyrolysis technique, it is not
highly appreciated due to high production cost as well as complex
equipment  requirement.  Moreover,  the  generated  biofuel  has  no
oxygenated value and harsh reaction conditions lead to production
of short chain molecules with more similarities to gasoline than
diesel fuel.

Transesterification. The most widely employed chemical meth-
ods for converting natural oils and fats into diesel fuel is trans-
esterification [33–35] , in which, stoichiometrically, three moles of
light alcohols (mainly methanol) react with one mole of triglyc-
eride. This process is usually performed in the presence of a cat-
alyst (60–70 °C, atmospheric pressure, 90 min) and results in the
production  of  a  mono-alkyl  ester  (mainly  methyl  ester)  called
biodiesel and glycerol as a by-product [36,37] . The unreacted al-
cohol can be recovered to some extent at the end of the process
and  glycerol  can  be  sold  to  existing  markets  to  reduce  the  pro-
duction costs. The separation of glycerol is extremely important to
enhance the quality of biodiesel and to prevent formation of haz-
ardous gases, i.e., acetaldehyde or formaldehyde during its combus-
tion  [38] .  The  application  of  dry  alcohol  and  oil  (with  low  con-
centration of FFA) is crucial for inhibiting the saponification and
increasing biodiesel formation. The holding time is in inverse re-
lation with temperature; however, temperature must be elevated
above 60 °C in combination with pressure due to methanol boil-
ing point (65 °C) as the most widely used alcohol. Alternatively, a
higher temperature at ambient pressure can be applied when other
alcohols such as butanol or ethanol is used. In contrast, lower cost
of methanol as well as its chemical and physical features is highly
preferable  for  transesterification  though  it  develops  a  two-phase
system.

Among  different  catalysts,  i.e.,  acids,  alkalis,  and  lipases  (en-
zymes),  alkaline-catalyzed  process  is  currently  regarded  as  the
most  popular  and  commercial  approach  by  accelerating  the  re-
action  up  to  40 0 0  times.  Alkoxides  such  as  sodium  methoxide,
hydroxides  such  as  potassium  or  sodium  hydroxides,  and  potas-
sium  and  sodium  carbonates  are  some  common  alkalis  for  this
purpose. Despite the higher price, the best alkaline catalysts are
alkaline  metal  alkoxides  that  provide  up  to  98%  yields  at  low
concentrations  (0.5  mol%)  after  30 min  reaction  time.  At  higher
molar concentration of catalyst (1–2 mol%), alkoxides can be sub-
stituted  by  cheaper  catalysts  including  potassium  or  sodium  hy-
droxides. In contrast, acidic treatment, catalyzed by hydrochloric or
sulfuric  acids,  is  mostly  applied  as  a  pre-treatment  process  (es-
terification)  for  raw  materials  with  high  FFA  contents.  Although
enzyme-catalyzed transesterification can be done in both aqueous
and organic systems and it is chemically clean and specific reac-
tion,  the  high  cost  of  enzyme  and  long  processing  time  render

it economically unfeasible and hinder its commercial application
[18,39,40] .

The  elementary  reaction  of  a  triglyceride  with  methanol  is
a three-step successive reversible reaction. First, methanol reacts
with triglyceride producing a diglyceride, followed by the reaction
of diglyceride with methanol producing a monoglyceride, and fi-
nally monoglyceride is reacted with methanol yielding glycerol. A
mole of FAME is produced in each of the above-mentioned steps
[41,42] . Thus, the overall reaction can be summarized as follows
[43] :

TG + 3 MeOH

catalyst
−−−−→ Glycerol + 3 FAME

(1)

These reactions proceed with different reaction rate constants
(k m ) in both forward and reverse directions and can all be con-
sidered second order or pseudo-second order reactions [41] . The
first reaction occurs  at a slower rate compared with the second
and the third reactions owing to the formation of diglyceride and
mass transfer limitations imposed by the immiscibility of the oil-
methanol combination [44–46] . The second reaction, however, is
the  fastest  step  of  all  because  the  produced  methyl  esters  con-
tribute  to  the  development  of  a  homogeneous  phase  by  acting
as  a  solvent  or  co-solvent  in  the  reaction  [47] .  Unlike  the  first
two steps, the third reaction tends to reverse because of the low
amount of reactants remained [48] .

1.3. Aim and scope

Currently, the high cost of biodiesel induced by high feedstock
and process costs is the major obstacle hampering its widespread
commercialization.  Therefore,  this  paper  is  aimed  at  reviewing
biodiesel  production  techniques  from  natural  oils  and  fats  using
conventional  and  advanced  reactors  with  an  in-depth  state-of-
the-art  focus  on  the  transesterification  process  as  the  beating
heart  of  biodiesel  plants.  The  effects  of  the  main  influential  pa-
rameters  including  quantity  and  type  of  catalyst,  FFA  content  of
feedstock, mixing intensity, alcohol/triglyceride molar ratio, reac-
tion  temperature,  alcohol  type,  water  content  of  feedstock,  type
of  oil,  and  reaction  time  [19,39,4 8,4 9]  on  the  transesterification
process  are  first  discussed  in  detail.  Different  transesterification
reactors;  e.g. ,  tubular/plug-flow  reactors  (packed  bed  reactors,
fluidized bed reactors, trickle bed reactor, oscillatory flow reactors,
micro-channel  reactors),  rotating  reactors  (stirred  tank  reactors,
rotating/spinning tubes reactors, spinning disc reactors), simulta-
neous  reaction-separation  reactors  (membrane  reactors,  reactive
distillation  reactors,  annular  centrifugal  contactors),  cavitational
reactors  (sonochemical/ultrasonic  reactors,  hydrodynamic  cavita-
tion reactors, shockwave power reactors), and microwave reactors
are then scientifically and practically scrutinized. Advantages and
disadvantages  of  each  reactor  technology  are  comprehensively
described. Some of the challenging issues impeding commercial-
ization  of  each  reactor  technology  are  also  highlighted.  In  the
final  part  of  this  paper,  the  sustainability  aspects  of  biodiesel
obtained through transesterification of various available feedstocks
have been analyzed with respect to net GHGs emission, impacts
on  tropical  forests  and  biodiversity,  socioeconomic  impacts,  and
food/water vs. fuel debate. The biorefinery concept utilizing waste-
oriented oils is also elaborated as a potential strategy to further
boost  the  economic  viability  and  environmental  sustainability  of
the biodiesel industry.

Overall, the present manuscript is very relevant to ongoing re-
search on biodiesel production and processing while the detailed
information provided will be very useful for researchers ( i.e. , en-
couraging  future  R&D)  in  the  field,  industrial  experts  and  policy
makers.

2. Main parameters affecting transesterification reaction

2.1. Catalyst

2.1.1. Type of catalyst
2.1.1.1. Homogenous  catalysts.  Homogeneous  catalysts  have  been
conventionally used in transesterification reaction by the biodiesel
industry. Homogeneous basic and acidic catalysts are inexpensive
and effective, but both require excess amount of alcohol and rela-
tively high energy to complete the conversion. Moreover, their ap-
plication is usually limited to batch processes and a catalyst sepa-
ration step is inevitable.

Homogeneous  basic  catalysts.  Alkaline  metal  hydroxide  and
methoxides such as potassium hydroxide (KOH), sodium hydrox-
ide (NaOH), potassium methoxide (CH
3 KO), and sodium methox-
ide  (CH
3 ONa)  are  the  most  commonly  used  homogeneous  base
catalysts  in  transesterification  reaction  [50] .  Among  them,  NaOH
and KOH are extensively used by the industry in transesterifica-
tion process. Although catalysts containing sodium are preferable
compared with potassium-based catalysts because of their lower
molecular  weight,  potassium  phosphate  could  be  obtained  after
neutralization of KOH at the end of the process and used as fer-
tilizer in agriculture [51] . Alkaline-catalyzed biodiesel production
follows a simple mechanism through which a tetrahedral interme-
diate is initially formed as a result of the interactions between the
3 O −) and
negative species of the incorporated alcohol (such as CH
the  carbonyl  groups  of  the  oily  feedstock.  Afterwards,  new  O –H
bonds are formed by the departure of R
3 . Reformation of
carbonyl groups will continue for two more identical cycles so that
a methyl ester is formed ( Fig. 1 ).

1 COOCH

A  study  conducted  by  Dias  et  al.  [52]  revealed  that  sodium-
3 ONa  have  higher  activities  in
based  catalysts  like  NaOH  and  CH
comparison with KOH for conversion of sunflower oil, WCO, and
soybean  oil.  Notably,  some  investigations  have  documented  that
alkali  methoxides  are  more  desirable  in  the  industry  than  alkali
hydroxides  because  they  do  not  generate  water  in  reaction  sys-
tem. Application of homogeneous alkali catalysts in the industry
has advantages such as high catalytic activity, low cost, wide avail-
ability, and short reaction time. However, it is accompanied with
some unfavorable issues as well. For example, homogeneous ba-
sic catalysis is limited to batch process, which needs high amount
of energy and high product cost. Moreover, water production, and
subsequently saponification could lower the final yield of methyl
esters. Importantly, alkali catalysts are sensitive to high content of
FFA in feedstock. Therefore, substrate containing more than 3 wt.%
of FFA must be pre-treated using acid catalysts to decrease the acid
value before alkali catalyzed-transesterification [53] .

Homogeneous  acid  catalysts.  Acid  catalysts  are  used  less  com-
monly than their basic counterparts in transesterification reaction
mainly  due  to  their  slow  reaction  rate  and  corrosive  nature.
In  addition,  higher  alcohol  requirement,  compared  with  that  of
the  homogeneous  basic  catalysts  is  another  major  shortcoming
associated with the application of acidic catalysts [54] . In contrast
to  alkali  catalysts,  acid  catalysts  can  be  used  for  conversion  of
low  cost  feedstocks  into  biodiesel  due  to  their  insensitivity  to
the  high  amount  of  FFA  in  oils.  Moreover,  saponification  never
occurs  during  acidic  catalysis.  The  most  common  acid  catalysts
applied in esterification reaction are sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid,
hydrochloric  acid,  and  sulfonic  acid.  During  the  acid-catalyzed
biodiesel production process, tetrahedral species are resulted from
the  interaction  of  positively-charged hydrogen ions  and  carbonyl
groups by the nucleophilic attraction of alcohol. In the next step,
H + is mobilized and the process is carried out for two more cycles
so that a methyl ester is formed ( Fig. 2 ).

Trifluoroacetic acid (0.2 M) was used for acid catalysis of soy-
bean  oil  at  80 °C  using  methanol-to-oil  molar  ratio  of  20:1  for

the production of biodiesel with 98.4% yield [55] . Su [56] tested
three homogeneous acid catalysts including hydrochloric acid, ni-
tric acid, and sulfuric acid to convert soybean oil into biodiesel. All
these acids showed high catalytic activities; however, hydrochlo-
ric  acid  was  the  only  recoverable  acid  and  could  be  reused  for
up to five cycles. After optimization of the process, a conversion
of 98.1% was obtained at 76.6 °C and methanol-to-oil molar ratio
of 7.9:1.

2.1.1.2. Heterogeneous  catalysts.  The  biodiesel  production  cost
can  be  discounted  by  applying  heterogeneous  catalysts  [57,58] ,
offering  several  advantages  such  as  easy  recovery  from  the  end
products ( i.e ., biodiesel and glycerol) as well as high tolerance to
feedstock  moisture  and  FFAs  contents.  These  advantages  reduce
saponification and contribute to the production of up to 24% more
pure biodiesel and glycerol, compared with that of homogeneous
catalysts  (75%  purity).  Nevertheless,  heterogeneous  catalysts  also
suffer from several disadvantages including more costly operating
conditions  (higher  temperature  and  pressure),  less  contact  with
the reactants (lower conversion rate), and the possibility of leach-
ing solid supports and consequent contamination of the produced
biodiesel as well as loss of the catalyst [49] .

Heterogeneous  basic  catalysts.  Various  types  of  heterogeneous
basic catalysts including hydrotalcites, metal oxides, mixed metal
oxides, supported hydroxides and oxides, and zeolites have been
used in transesterification reaction. Among the alkaline metal ox-
ides, calcium oxide (CaO) has been known as a non-corrosive and
ecofriendly alkaline catalyst with a high catalytic activity. Mixed
metal  oxides  have  also  been  introduced  as  promising  heteroge-
neous basic catalysts. These catalysts consist of two or more met-
als and the characteristics of the catalyst depend on the type and
the amount of each of these metals. The efficacy of various un-
supported mixed metal oxides including CaMnO x , BaMnO x , CaFeO x ,
BaFeO x ,  CaZrO x ,  and  CaCeO x  in  conversion  of  animal  fats  into
biodiesel have been studied by Dias, Alvim Ferraz [59] . Although
all the mixed metal oxides presented great basicity, the only un-
supported mixed metal oxides that showed catalytic activity was
CaMnO x with a biodiesel yield of 98% (4 wt.%, 60 °C, 9 h).

2 O

Taufiq et al. [60] synthesized CaO –La

3  metal oxide as cata-
lyst for transformation of jatropha oil into methyl ester. The cata-
lyst was synthesized through co-precipitation procedure with vari-
ous Ca:La atomic ratios. A yield corresponding to 87% was resulted
when the reaction was carried out with 4% catalyst at 60 °C and
methanol-to-oil molar ratio of 24:1. The catalyst was regenerated
through washing with methanol and calcination at 900 °C, but it
lost  its  activity  after  three  cycles  and  the  conversion  of  oil  into
biodiesel reduced to 18%. Sahani et al. [61] examined the strontium
lanthanum mixed metal oxide as catalyst for converting Schleichera
Oleosa oil into biodiesel. A FAME conversion of 76% was obtained in
the presence of 1.5% of catalyst loading with methanol-to-oil molar
ratio of 14:1 at 60 °C for 40 min.

Zeolites  are  another  effective  heterogeneous  catalyst  used  in
4  and
transesterification  process.  Zeolites  are  constructed  by  SiO
AlO
4 -tetrahedral structures,  which constitute  a  crystalline alumi-
nosilicate with high surface area. This microporous structure and
high capability in adsorption mark zeolites as efficient catalysts in
biodiesel production. These compounds are categorized in cation-
exchange materials, which can generate various types of structures
with different chemical and physical characteristics by substitution
of cations during ion exchange process. Zeolites Beta, X, A, Mor-
denite,  USY  and  ZSM-5  are  the  most  common  zeolites.  Babajide
et al. [62] investigated the catalyst activity of zeolite FA/NaX for
conversion of sunflower oil into methyl ester. FA/NaX was synthe-
sized from coal fly ash, a by-product of coal combustion, and ion
exchanging with K + . Conversion of oil was conducted in methanol-
to-oil molar ratio 6:1 at 65 °C with 3 wt.% of catalyst concentration.

The  biodiesel  production  yield  was  reported  as  56%  after  8 h  of
reaction  time.  To  achieve  higher  yields,  they  used  ion  exchange
process with potassium acetate to synthesize the catalyst FA/KX.
The substitution of catalysts increased the product yield to 83.5%
with same reaction time. The catalyst was also reused for further
reactions without activity loss after three cycles.

Hydrotalcites are anionic clays which are known as aluminum
and magnesium hydroxycarbonates. Hydrotalcites can be thermally
decomposed  and  mixed  oxide  elements  including  MgAl
4  and
MgO can be generated. These elements with high surface area pro-
vide suitable catalysts for biodiesel synthesis. In a study presented
by Navajas et al. [63] , magnesium-aluminium hydrotalcites (2 wt.%)
was used for transformation of sunflower oil into methyl ester at
methanol-to-oil  molar  ratio  of  48:1  and  reaction  temperature  of
60 °C. High yield (96%) was achieved after 8 h of reaction time and
the  catalyst  was  successfully  recovered  for  reutilization.  Another
group of heterogeneous basic catalysts are alkaline hydroxides sup-
ported on inorganic oxides. Li et al. [64] explored the effect of vari-
ous oxides as supporter of KOH on catalysts activity. Thirty percent

Heterogeneous  acidic  catalysts.  Heterogeneous  acid  catalysts
must meet some criteria such as having hydrophobicity, high num-
ber of active sites, and mild acid strength to be appropriate cata-
lysts for transesterification reaction [51] . Although acidic catalysts
are less attractive than basic catalysts for biodiesel synthesis be-
cause of their low activity rate, recent investigations have led to
new advancements in acidic catalysis minimizing their limitations.
Development of solid acid catalysts which possess both character-
istics of heterogeneous basic catalysts and mineral acids (such as
cation exchange resin, hetero-polyacids, silica-alumina, sulfonated
polystyrene, and zeolites) capable of performing simultaneous es-
terification and transesterification reactions while being resistant
to  water  content  and  high  FFA  content  is  among  such  advance-
ments [65] .

Non-edible oils or waste products of agriculture and food indus-
try can be used for biodiesel production which in turn can solve,
to  some  extents,  the  food  vs.  fuel  debate  [66–68] .  If  this  is  the
case, the application of heterogeneous acid catalysts is critical for
conversion of these low cost feedstocks. Guldhe et al. [69] tested
tungstated  zirconia  (WO
2 )  as  a  heterogeneous  acid  catalyst
for biodiesel synthesis from microalgal lipids. They compared the
tungstated  zirconia  activity  with  homogeneous  acid  catalyst  and
enzymatic catalysts. Their results demonstrated that 94.6% FAME
conversion was achieved with WO
2 at 100 °C which was com-
parable with that of the homogeneous catalyst but was superior vs.
the enzyme catalyst. Recently, a magnetic solid acid nano-catalyst
(SO
2 ) was synthesized and used for conversion of WCO
into biodiesel. The nano-catalyst showed high activities with 96%
of FAME yield under experimental conditions with remarkable sta-
bility  for  reutilization  over  10  cycles  [70] .  Table  2  tabulates  a
summary  of  the  most  recent  research  works  conducted  (2016–
2018) on the application of different kinds of homogeneous and
heterogeneous  catalysts  for  converting  natural  oils  and  fats  into
biodiesel.

used catalysts.

2.1.1.3. Enzymatic  catalysts.  Application  of  enzymatic  catalysts  in
transesterification  reaction  provides  remarkable  advantages  over
chemical catalysts. Enzymatic catalysts that are immobilized or sol-
uble  lipases  are  ecofriendly  materials,  which  can  be  used  as  ef-
ficient catalysts to convert low cost feedstock such as non-edible
oils  into  biodiesel  in  the  presence  of  high  amounts  of  FFA  and
water. In an enzymatic catalysis, feedstock treatment and catalyst
removal  are  not  needed.  Moreover,  the  reaction  occurs  in  mild
conditions  with  low  energy  consumption,  offering  a  sustainable
way for biodiesel production. Lipases used as catalyst are mainly
originated from biological sources such as microorganisms, plants,

and animals [104,105] . Although the price of enzymatic catalysts
are relatively high, their industrial applications have been adapted
by some companies around the world such as Hainabaichuan Co.
LTD  and  Lvming  Co.  LTD  (China),  Piedmont  Biofuel  (USA),  and
Sunho Biodiesel Corporation (Taiwan) [106] . Enzymatic mechanism
( Fig. 3 ) is, however, slightly different as both positive and negative
charges are available. Active sites containing acidic or basic char-
acteristics initiate the reaction by donating or accepting protons in
a mechanism known as Bi model. Accepting or donating behavior
is in relation with the nature of the incorporated enzyme. Whilst
enzymes like lipase act as a hydroxyl (OH  ̄) group acceptor, other
enzymes like those bearing amine groups are expected to donate
protons. Afterwards, the reaction is completed by the same steps
previously discussed in the acidic or basic mechanisms ( Fig. 3 ).

Table 4 tabulates a summary of the most recent research works
conducted (2016–2018) on the application of enzymatic catalysts
for converting natural oils and fats into biodiesel.

2.1.2. Effect of catalysts concentration on transesterification

Catalyst  loading  in  transesterification  reaction  is  recognized
as  one  of  the  critical  factors  to  achieve  the  maximum  biodiesel
yield.  The  lowest  concentration  of  catalyst  is  normally  decided
in primary steps of process, and then it is gradually raised based
on  the  reaction  conditions  and  products  content.  Amani  et  al.
[115]  showed  that  FAME  content  increased  to  some  point  with
increasing the  catalyst  loading.  In  their  study,  the  optimum  cat-
alyst  loading  was  characterized  as  3 wt.%  in  which  the  FAME
content  stood  at  90%.  Higher  concentrations  of  catalyst  had
negative  influence  on  biodiesel  production  as  the  FAME  content
decreased to 83% in the presence of 4 wt.% of catalyst. According
to Ezebor et al. [116] , increasing catalyst loading leads to product
adsorption and finally FAME yield reduction. Chuah et al. [117] ex-
amined the impact of basic catalyst loading on biodiesel produc-
tion from WCO. They tested various NaOH concentrations ranging
from 0.5 to 1.25 wt.% while keeping other reaction factors constant.
Their results revealed that the conversion of triglyceride to methyl

ester  occurred  incompletely  at  catalyst  concentrations  of  less
than 1 wt.%, delivering just 63% yield at 0.5 wt.% NaOH. Increasing
catalyst  loading  to  1 wt.%  improved  triglyceride  conversion  to
97%. In contrast, more catalyst concentration (1.25 wt.%) decreased
the  triglyceride  conversion  to  90%.  The  main  issue  about  using
high concentrations of basic catalysts is the reaction of FFA with
catalyst  leading  to  saponification  and  water  generation,  both  of
which  finally  contribute  to  reduction  of  biodiesel  yield.  It  has
been also reported that using 3 wt.% of H
4  resulted in 86.4%
biodiesel  yield  whereas  higher  concentrations  of  the  catalyst  (5
and 7 wt.%) did not have significant effect on FAME yield [118] .

2.1.3. Effect of catalyst shape and size on transesterification

Catalyst  shape  and  size  could  influence  reaction  process  as
well as functionality of the system. Generally, catalysts with lower

particle  sizes  have  higher  surface  area;  and  therefore,  could  in-
crease  the  transesterification  reaction  by  reducing  mass  trans-
fer limitations. Rahimzadeh et al. [57] synthesized and compared
SO
3 H-functionlized  multiwall  carbon  nanotubes  with  acid  acti-
vated  bentonite  and  found  that  the  latter  had  higher  biodiesel
production  yield  mainly  due  to  its  larger  pore  volume  (0.76  vs .
0.25 cm 3 /g) and surface area (230 vs . 92.37 m 2 /g). However, sepa-
ration of very fine catalysts from reaction medium could be prob-
lematic.  Moreover,  the  application  of  these  catalysts  could  plug
packed bed reactors (PBRs) by occupying the spaces between pel-
lets.  Alternatively,  some  shape  designs  ( e.g.,  solid  cylinders,  hol-
low cylinders with axially extruded holes, etc. ) allow synthesizing
larger catalysts with high surface area while at the same time in-
fers higher stability and rigidity. Therefore, it is obvious that the
shape and size of catalysts are among the important criteria for

determining the right packing particles for the reactor technologies
consisting catalyst beds.

2.3. Mass-transfer

2.2. Methanol-to-oil molar ratio

The  alcohol  content  determines  biodiesel  yield  by  preventing
transesterification reaction from proceeding in reversible direction
at the end of reaction. Various alcohols such as methanol, ethanol,
tert-butanol, butanol, and isopropanol can be applied for transes-
terification of oils. Among them, lower alcohols, i.e. , methanol and
ethanol, are the most common alcohol used in this process. Other
alcohols are hardly applied because they are expensive and have
no economic justification. Methanol is advantageous over other al-
cohols,  mainly  due  to  its  specific  chemical  and  physical  charac-
teristics. For instance, it has the capability to react quickly with
triglyceride and dissolve very well in NaOH. The content of water
in alcohol is also a significant factor in transesterification reaction
as excessive water amount can react with triglyceride and causes
saponification. Generally, it is supposed that high methanol-to-oil
molar ratios facilitates the triglycerides conversion into monoglyc-
erides and accelerates the transesterification process. Stoichiomet-
rically, the alcohol-to-oil molar ratio must be 3:1, however, in a
real reaction system a higher molar ratio is needed to raise the
miscibility of methanol and triglyceride molecules as well as the
possibility of their contact for improving the final product yield.
Moreover, high amounts of methanol are required to dissociate the
linkage between triglyceride and fatty acid to increase the produc-
tivity and complete the reaction in a shorter time. In this regard,
the formation of alkyl esters is induced in commercial transesteri-
fication processes by surplus amount of dry alcohol, 6:1 ≤ alcohol-
to-oil molar ratio [119] .

Glycerol can be easily separated from reaction slurry by settling
or centrifugation since it is essentially insoluble in biodiesel [120] .
However, when using high alcohol-to-oil molar ratios, glycerol sol-
ubility in biodiesel increases and free glycerol may remain either
as suspended droplets or as small dissolved amount in biodiesel
[120] .  This  can  be  attributed  to  the  fact  that  alcohols  can  func-
tion as co-solvents increasing the solubility of glycerol in biodiesel.
In  addition,  separation  and  recycling  of  the  remnant  content  of
methanol  at  the  end  of  reaction  needs  high  amount  of  energy.
Therefore, an appropriate amount of methanol must be determined
to  avoid  yield  loss  and  uneconomic  methanol  recycling  process.
In  line  with  that,  Wu  et  al.  [121]  probed  the  NaOH  catalyzed-
transesterification of soybean oil into biodiesel at methanol-to-oil
molar ratios (4.5:1–9:1). The reaction was conducted in a 500 mL
3-neck mechanically-stirred flask reactor equipped with condenser
and sampling port. Their findings indicated that a methanol-to-oil
molar ratio of 7.5:1 resulted in FAME yield of 97.45% after 60 min
residence time. The main reason for using the alcohol-to-oil molar
ratio higher than 6:1 in this study was the employment of ben-
tonite  as  moisture  remover,  which  could  adsorb  small  amounts
of  methanol  as  well.  In  another  study,  Sanli  et  al.  [122]  exam-
ined  the  effect  of  alcohol-to-oil  molar  ratio  ranging  from  3:1  to
20:1 on the transesterification process in the presence of potas-
sium hydroxide, sodium methoxide, and potassium methoxide cat-
alysts.  They  noted  that  the  highest  yield  (99.08%)  obtained  at
ethanol-to-oil molar ratio of 8:1 and 1.40 wt.% sodium methoxide
after 2 h.

Behzadi and Farid [123] reported that the transesterification re-
action is generally controlled by three important stages, viz. mass
transfer, equilibrium and kinetic of the reaction. Notably, the mass
transfer  in  reaction  is  the  slowest  stage  among  the  others  be-
cause of weak immiscibility of methanol and triglyceride. The ki-
netic of reaction is controlled through a second order mechanism
with alcohol-to-oil molar ratio of 6:1 or follows a pseudo-first or-
der mechanism for high ratios like 30:1.

The  efficiency  and  the  rate  of  the  catalytic  transesterification
are considerably diffusion controlled. The slow reactions in initial
and final stages are respectively due to reagents immiscibility and
reactant  unavailability,  i.e.,  catalyst  extraction  by  glycerol.  These
phenomena slow down the reaction to the point that is not practi-
cal for an economic one-step process [124] . The miscibility can be
improved by application of different types of mixers or agitators
as well as optimization of mixing intensity, alcohol-to-oil molar ra-
tio, pressure, temperature (heating system), and their combinations
thereof.

2.3.1. Mixing system

Awareness about the effect of mixing intensity on the rate of
transesterification reaction dates back to early 1980s [119] . In the
biodiesel production process, agitation is a vital parameter due to
its  critical  influence  on  mixing  degree  ( i.e .,  turbulence)  between
immiscible alcohol-oil phase, the mass transfer, and reaction rate
of alcoholysis. Therefore, in-depth understanding of the impact of
mixing on the transesterification process is a crucial parameter in
the scaling-up and design of reactors.

Industrial  agitators  and  mixers  for  biodiesel  production  pro-
cess  may  include:  anchor  agitators,  helix  mixers,  high-shear
mixers,  magnetic  stirrers,  mechanical  stirrers,  turbines  agitator,
micro-mixers,  motionless  or  static  mixers,  two  flat-blade  paddle
agitators, and ultrasonic mixers. Moreover, there are other novel
mixing methods such as mixing with the help of the oscillatory
frequency in baffled tubes in continuously oscillatory flow reactors.
This  novel  mixing  method  provides  a  performance  equivalence
of  80  ideal  continuously  stirred  tank  reactors  (CSTR)  in  series,
which is enough to produce biodiesel commercially from rapeseed
methyl esters in the presence of 50% excess methanol (0.3–0.5 wt.%
NaOH, 60–70 °C, 15–30 min) [125] . Noureddini et al. [126] analyzed
the influence of motionless and high shear mixers on continuous
biodiesel  production  individually  and  in  combination  with  each
other. They recorded more than 97% conversion of soybean oil into
FAME when at least one of the mixers was present in the process.
However, it was emphasized that the motionless mixer was more
effective  than  the  high-shear  mixer.  Sánchez  et  al.  [127]  also
applied high-shear mixer at 40 0 0 rpm to vigorously increase mass
transfer  in  transesterification  reaction.  In  the  presence  of  1 wt.%
catalyst  and  methanol-to-oil  molar  ratio  of  6:1,  nanodroplets  of
reagents were formed, and subsequently, converted into biodiesel
within 60 s of dispersion at 22 °C. In another study, a mechanical
stirrer was applied to synthesize biodiesel with American Society
for  Testing  and  Materials  (ASTM)  D  6751  properties  through
methanolysis of 50:50 wt.% blend of castor seed oil and waste fish
oil (0.5 wt.% KOH, 8:1 methanol-to-oil molar ratio, 32 °C, 600 rpm,
30 min) with yield of 97.7% [128] .

Sungwornpatassakul  et  al.  [129]  compared  static  mixer  with
mechanical stirrer with respect to reaction rate and droplet size.
In addition to faster reaction rate, the former also formed droplets
that 90% of them had diameter less than 5 μm. Ji et al. [130] de-
veloped alkaline-catalyzed transesterification method coupled with
ultrasonic mixer (19.7 kHz). Similarly, soy-based biodiesel (94.71%
yield)  with  ASTM  D6751  and  IS  15607:2005  standards  was  ob-
tained using the same type of mixer adjusted at 35 kHz (6.15 wt.%
KI-impregnated  zinc  oxide,  10.2:1  methanol-to-oil  molar  ratio,
62 °C)  [131] .  Ultrasound  mixing  system  forms  cavities  in  liquid-
liquid interface, and subsequently creates micro fine bubbles. Then,
micro jets are developed as a result of asymmetrical collision of
the  bubbles,  causing  an  intensive  blending  of  the  liquids  [132] .
However, appropriate power of ultrasonic mixer must be optimized
according to the size and volume of reactor; otherwise, excess mix-
ing power generates heat. This heat introduces bubbles in the re-

action system through vaporization of the solvent, which in turn,
sequentially  reduce  solvent  content,  the  interface  area,  and  the
yield  of  biodiesel.  Compared  with  mechanical  stirring,  hydrody-
namic and ultrasonic mixers have lower requirements for catalyst
(up to three-time less) and shorter reaction times (10–60 min). Hy-
drodynamic mixer is even a better mixer than ultrasonic one, al-
lowing better mixing for immiscible liquids as well as easier scale-
up process regardless of geometric characteristics of reactor. This
technology provides simultaneous injection of all reagent liquids
in pre-defined proportions into a vessel through a mixing collec-
tor. Therefore, no mixing vessel is required for homogenization and
both mixing time as well as energy consumption could be reduced
while precision of portioning could be improved.

Joshi et al. [133] compared the contribution of hydrodynamic
mixer  (high-speed  homogenizer,  12,0 0 0 rpm)  to  heterogeneous
catalyzed-transesterification  reaction  of  soybean  and  WCOs  with
that of the conventional stirring method with respect to reaction
time. The former delivered microscale turbulence and fine emul-
sions, reducing the reaction time from 120–180 min to 30 min with
same  yields  of  biodiesels.  Kolhe  et  al.  [134]  used  cooking  oil  as
feedstock  and  transformed  it  into  biodiesel  using  hydrodynamic
mixer (0.55 wt.% KOH, 4.5:1 methanol-to-oil molar ratio, 20 min).
Compared with stirred tank reactor (STR; 88.5% yield, 60 min), over
5% more conversion of the same feedstock was obtained in three-
time faster reaction rate. Yadav et al. [135] utilized hydrodynamic
mixer for conversion of Thevetica peruviana (Yellow Oleander) oil
into  biodiesel  (1 wt.%  KOH,  6:1  methanol-in-oil  molar  ratio,  40–
55 °C,  30–45 min)  with  97.5%  yield.  The  mixing  system  included
a closed loop fluid circuit supported by a 10 L mixing collector, a
2.2 kW centrifugal pump, control valve, and 5 cm orifice plates con-
taining up to seven holes ranging from 1–4 mm pore diameters.

Mixing performance has inevitable influence on designing re-
actors,  which  is  crucial  for  the  development  of  a  homogeneous
reaction  environment.  However,  excess  mixing  reduces  the  eco-
nomic feasibility of process by increasing equipment and operation
complexities, interfering with the proper alcohol-to-oil molar ratio
by making alcohol less available due to vaporization and/or bub-
ble formation, and ultimately surging production costs because of
higher capital and energy requirement and lower yield of conver-
sion. As an example, power supply requirements for mild, moder-
ate, and intense mixing in continuous reactors are 0.1–0.2 kW/m 3 ,
0.4–0.6 kW/m 3 , and 0.8–2.0 kW/m 3 , respectively [136] . The degree
of mixing as a result of a moving part is mainly determined by
frequency of mixer rotation, and to a lesser extent, by geometry of
system, characteristics of mixer ( i.e ., impeller, direction, etc. ), and
physical properties of fluid ( i.e ., viscosity, volume, etc. ). For a sys-
tem with specific flow characteristics, geometric and power supply,
the mixing rate can be determined by applying the interrelation of
two dimensionless numbers as described in Eqs. (2) and ( 3 ) [136] :

where N p  denotes the power number, N Re  the Reynolds number,
P the mixer power consumption, g c the Newton’s gravity accelera-
tion, ρ the fluid density, N the impeller speed, μ the fluid dynamic
viscosity, and D a the impeller diameter.

Stamenkovic et al. [137] measured size distribution of droplets
during  KOH  catalyzed-methanolysis  of  sunflower  oil  in  a  stirred
reactor  (10 0 0 mL,  10 cm  diameter)  with  two-flat-blade  paddle  of
7.5 cm in diameter. Using microphotographic technique, it was ob-
served  that  intensifying  agitation  forms  smaller  size  drops  with
less size variations ( i.e ., droplet size distribution). Similarly, Li et al.
[138]  reported  a  direct  relation  between  increasing  the  rotation

speed  (20 0–80 0 rpm)  and  biodiesel  production  yield.  The  stirrer
speed considerably controls the mass transfer kinetics with respect
to economic transesterification of J. Curcas oil [139] . It has been re-
vealed that the influence of stirring rate on the control of biodiesel
production is highest during initial stages of reaction, and then its
significance drops as the reaction proceeds. Different kinetics mod-
els have been presented for quantification of the impact of rotation
frequency of mixer on transesterification process [42,46,140–143] .
These  models  have  the  ability  to  predict  the  reaction  evolution
for only specified mixing scenarios, i.e., single mixing model. This
disadvantage was corrected in a methodology proposed by Brásio
et al. [144] who further validated their model by applying it to in-
dependent sets of experimental data previously provided in some
single mixing models.

2.3.2. Temperature (heating system)

Although there is a controversy regarding the role of tempera-
ture in transesterification reaction, operational temperature is con-
sidered  by  many  as  an  important  factor  for  proper  production
of biodiesel. Table 5 presents the contribution of temperature, in
combination with alcohol-to-oil molar ratio, to the transesterifica-
tion reaction rate of different feedstocks.

From Table 5 , it can be postulated that at least no economically
profitable  reaction  could  be  conducted  at  temperatures  below
32 °C.  Moreover,  the  application  of  temperatures  lower  than  the
melting  point  of  oil,  for  example,  50 °C  in  the  case  of  palm  oil,
would not be practical due to elevated viscosity. Generally, higher
temperatures shorten the reaction time by facilitating mass trans-
fer.  However,  beyond  certain  limits,  the  increase  in  temperature
either has adverse effects on reactants/reagents (degradation, side-
reactions, vaporization) or is not cost-efficient. Therefore, optimiz-
ing temperature is necessary for both designing reactors as well as
commercial production of biodiesel. It is noteworthy that the tem-
perature near to alcohol boiling point is the optimum temperature
for  non-enzymatic  conventional  processes.  Beyond  this  tempera-
ture,  both  mass  transfer  and  yield  of  transesterification  reaction
drop due to loss of one of the reagents, i.e., alcohol through vapor-
ization. To address this issue, novel processes have been introduced
that use heat in combination with pressure (see Section 2.3.3 ).

Freedman  et  al.  [119]  reported  temperature  as  a  significant
variable  for  speeding  up  the  transesterification  of  various  veg-
etable oils including cottonseed, peanut, soybean, and sunflower.
According to their results, the reaction rate was four-time faster
when conducted at ≥60 °C rather than 32 °C. Darnoko and Cheryan
[44]  assessed  the  influence  of  temperature  (50–65 °C)  on  the
methylation process of palm oil in a batch system (1 wt.% KOH, 6:1
methanol-to-oil  molar  ratio).  They  observed  that  relatively  same
yield  of  biodiesel  was  produced  in  higher  temperatures  within
shorter time, compared with lower temperature. Thompson and He
[153]  produced  canola-based  biodiesel  by  several  connected  and
continuously fed static mixers as the reactor. They emphasized that
at a fixed reaction duration of 30 min, the catalyst concentration
below 0.5 wt.% of oil and the temperature of 40 °C were the lim-
iting factors for the progress of transesterification reaction. Aniya
et al. [154] studied mass transfer during karanja FAME production.
It was observed that both temperature and time govern the overall
reaction kinetics in a batch reactor (1 wt.% KOH, 6:1 methanol-to-
oil molar ratio, 600 rpm). A 20 °C increment in the reaction tem-
perature from 35 °C to 55 °C improved the volumetric mass transfer
coefficient by 6.5 times, reaching 20 L/h. Moreover, the methanoly-
sis reaction was initially irreversible at high temperatures due to a
more dominant equilibrium reaction rate.

Some  examples  of  conventional  heating  systems  in  biodiesel
production  reactors  are  batch  bath,  heating  coils,  and  jacketed
reactors.  More  recently,  infrared  heater,  microwave  irradiations,
and  radio  frequency  heater  have  also  been  applied  as  new  di-

electric heating technologies with improved economic feasibilities.
Among  these  novel  heating  systems,  microwave  is  the  most  ex-
tensively studied method for biodiesel production whereas radio
frequency is most economic heating system. In a similar transes-
terification process, the outcome of microwave-assisted system is
advantageous over its thermally heated counterparts in terms of
reaction rate and energy consumption. Microwave irradiation im-
proves reaction rate by affecting activation free energy and/or in-
creasing  the  frequency  of  molecular  vibrations.  The  latter  factor
leads  to  an  induced  molecular  mobility.  Commonly,  microwave-
heating is applied in conjunction with mixing to avoid formation
of  hot  spots.  Leadbeater  and  Stencel  [155]  applied  a  600 W  mi-
crowave heating system with a 5-L vessel for conversion of 3 kg
of  an  unspecified  vegetable  oil  into  biodiesel  in  the  presence  of
either ethanol or methanol (1 wt.% KOH, 6:1 alcohol-to-oil molar
ratio, 50 °C, 1 min). The reaction mixture was continuously stirred
with the help of an overhead paddle agitator with an unspecified
rate. Azcan and Danisman [156] studied the possibility of apply-
ing  67%  of  exit  power  generated  by  a  1200 W  microwave  heat-
ing system for methanolysis of cottonseed oil (1% wt.% KOH/NaOH,
6:1 methanol-to-oil molar ratio, 50 °C, 3–5 min). Interestingly, they
observed  a  positive  correlation  between  biodiesel  purity  (96.1–
99.4%) and reaction temperature (40–60 °C). Compared with con-
ventional  heating  systems,  the  microwave-assisted  process  is  up
to six-time faster. Surprisingly, a much more reduction in reaction
time (360 times) was claimed by Lin and Chen [157] during syn-
thesis of biodiesel by microwave heating assisted methanolysis of
pre-esterified jatropha seeds oil (1 wt.% KOH, 6:1 methanol-to-oil
molar ratio, 65 °C, 200 rpm, 10 s). Milano et al. [158] stated that un-
der optimize conditions (0.8 wt.% KOH, 59.6 vol.% of methanol:oil,
10 0 °C,  60 0 rpm,  7 min),  a  biodiesel  yield  of  up  to  98%  could  be
obtained from alkaline-catalyzed methylation of a blend of Calo-
phyllum  inophyllum  and  WCOs  (vol.  ratio  of  3:7)  using  a  850 W
microwave-assisted  process.  During  optimizing  reaction  time  (2–
10 min), they noticed that the reaction time was doubled by every
10 °C drops in the process temperature.

Compared  with  microwave-heating  system,  radio  frequency
heater  is  more  efficient  in  conversion  of  electricity  into  electro-
magnetic  power  with  more  penetrative  characteristics  and  more
simple configuration. Heat is quickly generated as the result of di-
rect  collision  of  a  radio  frequency  electromagnetic  field  with  an
object.  Radio  frequency  heating  was  efficiently  employed  by  Liu
et al. [159] for the esterification of WCO with a high amount of
FFA (3 wt.% H
4 , 80 wt.% methanol, 8 min) as well as its subse-
quent methanolysis (0.9 wt.% NaOH, 14.2:1 methanol-to-oil molar
ratio, 5 min), yielding 99% biodiesel. They emphasized that temper-
ature influences the ionic conductivity of reagents, and subsequent

radio frequency heating efficiency. Therefore, pre-heating by con-
ventional heaters to increase the process temperature to 35 °C was
suggested before application of radio frequency heater. In a sep-
arate study, Liu et al. [160] reported a conversion yield of 96.3%
during  transesterification  of  beef  tallow  using  a  radio  frequency
heater  (0.6 wt.%  NaOH,  9:1  methanol-to-beef  tallow  molar  ratio,
5 min). Unfortunately, none of these two studies reported the re-
action temperatures and had no control on it as well.

2.3.3. Mass transfer intensification systems

As elaborated earlier, to nullify mass-transfer limitation, either
mixing or heating systems must provide significantly high amounts
of energy, which is not economically favorable. Moreover, temper-
atures  higher  than  boiling  point  of  solvents,  for  example,  65 °C
in the case of methanol is not practical at atmospheric pressure.
Therefore, these systems ( i.e., mixing or heating) are applied to-
gether and are supported by a number of other intensification sys-
tems, including addition of co-solvents and/or alternative solvent,
or  phase-transfer  catalysts  (PTCs)  to  simultaneously  cope  with
mass transfer limitation in the biodiesel synthesis process as well
as to simplify the isolation of catalysts, products, and reagents. For
instance, in alkaline-catalyzed methanolysis, mass transfer limita-
tion occurs due to immiscible alcohol and oil phases. This barrier
can be overcome through converting the system into single-phase
by application of co-solvents, for examples, biodiesel, supercritical
carbon  dioxide (SCCD),  hexane,  methyl tert-butyl  ether,  propane,
or tetrahydrofuran. However, the rate of co-solvent-added (single-
phase) methanolysis reaction drastically falls due to drop of system
polarity caused by catalyst precipitation [124] . To compensate this
shift in polarity, alcohol-to-oil molar ratio must be considerably el-
evated, which makes the process complicated by raising the size of
manufacturing plants.

Moreover,  it  was  observed  that  in  an  enzyme-catalyzed
methanolysis reaction of canola oil, the yield of biodiesel increases
with  co-solvent  concentration  to  some  point  due  to  miscibility
improvement, after which they show an inverse relation because
of lipase inactivation [161] . Alternatively, phase separation during
methanolysis can be prevented through application of supercritical
methanol (SCM; 9–43 MPa, 200–350 °C), a popular alternative sol-
vent method. Solvents at their supercritical states have gas-like dif-
fusivity and liquid-like density. Regardless of catalyst application,
these properties provide an ideal system for convenient, efficient,
and quick production of FAMEs via transesterification of oils even
in presence of water and FFAs [49] . The energy consumption of the
supercritical technique can be reduced through introduction of co-
solvents as well. Maçaira et al. [162] combined alternative solvent
method with addition of co-solvent technique through application

252

of SCM and SCCD as solvent and co-solvent, respectively. This cat-
alytic process was used on a fixed-bed reactor for continuous pro-
duction of biodiesel (yield of 88%) at 200 °C with 2 min reaction
time. In a similar approach, propane was combined as a co-solvent
with  SCM  to  make  soy-based  biodiesel  production  process  less
energy  intensive  (24:0.01:1  molar  ratio  of  methanol:propane:oil,
12.8 MPa, 280 °C, 10 min) [163] .

SCM cannot be applied in enzymatic transesterification process
since its high temperature (up to 350 °C) inactivates enzymes. On
the contrary, enzymatic transesterification (20-30 wt.% Novozyme
435)  could  commonly  be  carried  out  using  normal  methanol
and SCCD (6:1 methanol-to-oil molar ratio, 20 MPa, 45–50 °C) as
acyl  acceptor  (solvent)  and  co-solvent,  respectively  [164] .  Com-
pared with catalyzed-SCM transesterification process, catalyst-free
SCM transesterification involves a more simple, trouble-free, and
ecofriendly purification step. For instance, tobacco-based biodiesel
with yields more than 91%, meeting EN14214 standards, was re-
portedly produced via catalyst-free SCM methylation of Nicotiana
tabacum seed oil (43:1 methanol-to-oil molar ratio, 27 MPa, 303 °C,
90 min)  [165] .  Aboelazayem  et  al.  [166]  converted  91%  of  WCO
into  FAME  with  EN14214  properties  by  adapting  a  non-catalytic
SCM process (37:1 methanol-to-oil molar ratio, 19.8 MPa, 253.5 °C,
14.8 min).  Similarly,  a  catalyst-free  SCM  system  (5:1  molar  ra-
tio, 9 MPa, 270 °C, 20 min) was applied for in-situ methylation of
wet spent coffee grounds, containing 86.33 wt.% esterifiable lipids
[167] .

Sakdasri  et  al.  [168]  analyzed  the  commercial  feasibility  of
40,0 0 0  t/year  FAMEs  production  from  palm  oil  in  two  different
SCM  systems;  viz.  advanced  SCM  with  low  alcohol-to-oil  molar
ratio  of  12:1,  and  conventional  homogeneous  alkaline-catalyzed
SCM  with  high  alcohol-to-oil  molar  ratio  of  42:1  using  Aspen
plus ® software.  Although  the  advanced  SCM  required  about  1.5-
time higher capital investment than the conventional method (4.91
million USD), it was commercially profitable by providing close to
22% greater net present value than manufacturing cost. In contrast,
the conventional SCM was found uneconomic due to the require-
ment for recycling large amounts of methanol.

Alternative solvent technique can also be performed using ionic
liquids, i.e., organic salts that melt at or below ambient temper-
ature.  These  non-volatile,  easy-to-produce  green  solvents  could
provide  flexible  hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity  through  appropri-
ate  modifications  in  their  anion  or  cation  moieties.  Therefore,
these designer solvents are highly appreciated for their contribu-
tion in two-phase catalysis via simplifying the catalyst/biocatalyst
dispersion  (mass  transfer  improvement),  recovery,  and  recycling.
Wu  et  al.  [169]  applied  1-(4-sulfonic  acid)  butylpyridinium  hy-
drogen  sulfate  as  ionic  liquid  for  methanolysis  of  cottonseed  oil
and  achieved  92%  yield  of  conversion.  Isahak  et  al.  [170]  also
5  ̄ cat-
used ionic liquid for the synthesis of choline chloride.ZnCl
alyst for transesterification of palm oil. Yanfei et al. [171] gener-
ated soy-based biodiesel with a yield close to 95% in the presence
of  4 wt.%  [(CH
4  ionic  liquid  of  oil  (14:1
methanol-to-oil  molar  ratio,  120 °C,  8.7 h).  Additionally,  1-ethyl-
3-methylimmidazolium  methyl  sulfate  ionic  liquid  was  coupled
with  microwave  irradiation  for  in-situ  methanolysis  of  wet  alga
Nannochloropsis  sp.  biomass (4:2:1 v/v/w ratio of  methanol:ionic
liquid:wet  biomass,  25 min),  leading  to  more  than  42%  yield  of
biodiesel  per  dry  weight  of  alga  [172] .  Recently,  Ding  et  al.
[173] intensified the transesterification of palm oil by combining
an ionic liquid 4-(3-methyl-1-imidazolio)-1-butanesulfonic acid hy-
drogen sulfate with microwave-heating system. A yield up to 99%
was  achieved  in  the  presence  of  9.2 wt.%  ionic  liquid  and  11:1
methanol-to-oil molar ratio with 168 W microwave power (equal
to 108 °C) for 6.43 h.

During  transesterification  process,  further  to  the  above-stated
advantages,  ionic  liquids  can  also  increase  the  stability  and  per-

formance  of  enzymes  against  adverse  effects  of  short-chain  al-
cohols and accumulated glycerol, respectively. Many studies have
applied  different  combinations  of  enzymes  and  ionic  liquids  for
the  production  of  biodiesel.  Among  many  ionic  liquids,  1,3-
dialkylimidazolium  salts  in  water  soluble  form,  i.e.,  1-butyl-3-
methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate, [BMIm][BF
4 ]; and water in-
soluble  form,  i.e.,  1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium  hexafluorophos-
6 ] have been commonly utilized in various stud-
phate, [BMIm][PF
ies.  [BMIm][PF
6 ]-containing  40%  enzyme  was  used  to  catalyze
methanolysis  of  waste  oil  into  biodiesel  with  72%  yield  (6:1
methanol-to-oil molar ratio, 50 °C, 14 h) [110] . Up to 99% biodiesel
yield  was  achieved  during  Novozyme  435  catalyzed-methylation
6 ] (2 wt.% lipase, 8:1 methanol-
of sunflower oil using [BMIm][PF
to-oil molar ratio, 1:1 wt. ratio of ionic liquid:oil, 58–60 °C, 10 h).
While in both studies, the effort s to obt ain high biodiesel yields
using  another  ionic  liquid,  i.e.,  [BMIm][BF
4 ]  ended unsatisfactory
[110,174] .

As  mentioned  earlier,  addition  of  co-solvents  and  alterna-
tive  solvents  methods  positively  influence  the  mass  transfer  of
transesterification reaction by integrating the phases system into
single-phase system. A different principle is also applied in PTCs
approach,  in  which,  an  appropriate  compound  speeds  up  the
reaction  between  two  immiscible  liquid  reagents  through  pro-
moting  the  interphase  transfer  of  species  [175,176] .  The  supe-
riority  of  this  technique  over  conventional  methods  is  aprotic-
solvent-free and shorter reaction with easier scale-up process. In
alkaline-transesterification of oils, the anion transfer between po-
lar methanol/glycerol and non-polar oil phases, and subsequently
mass transfer limitation as well as side reactions can be reduced
via dissolving organic PTCs in the organic phase, i.e., liquid-liquid
PTC (LLPTC) mode [176] . Crown ethers, cryptates, and quaternary
ammonium are commonly applied PTCs in chemistry. Despite the
great adaptability of LLPTC, its application remained undervalued
in  biodiesel  industry.  PTC  potential  in  transesterification  process
was  first  noticed  during  facilitated  migration  of  reactants  in  the
presence of a small amount of soap produced due to saponifica-
tion phenomenon [177] . Then, Zhang et al. [176] investigated sev-
eral  PTCs  containing  different  anions  and  cations  in  methylation
of soybean oil. A biodiesel yield of 96.5 wt.% was achieved in the
presence  of  tetrabutylammonium  hydroxide  or  tetrabutylammo-
nium acetate (1:1 KOH-to-PTC molar ratio, 6:0.2:1 methanol:total
hydroxide:oil  molar  ratio,  60 °C,  15 min).  The  most  recent  study
in this field was conducted by Hailegiorgis et al. [178] , in which
the  reaction  rate  of  in-situ  transesterification  of  J.  curcas  L.  was
improved by the application of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide
(CTMAB).  They  reported  CTMAB-to-NaOH  molar  ratio  of  1.5:1,
methanol:biomass of 6.8 vol./wt., NaOH:biomass of 1.3 wt.%, 43 °C,
and 1.8 h as optimum conditions.

2.4. Residence time

Another  parameter  that  must  be  optimized  for  improving
biodiesel  yield  is  residence/reaction  time,  which  can  be  defined
as  the  time  that  chemical  species  expend  in  the  reactor  till  the
reaction  is  completed  or  stopped.  The  required  residence  time
is directly dependent on other parameters that enhance the rate
of transesterification reaction, such as mixing intensity, residence
time distribution (RTD), and temperature. Unlike batch reactors, in
which all chemical species have an identical residence time, the
continuous  (flow)  reactors  lead  to  a  phenomenon  referred  to  as
RTD. RTD is generated due to continuous introduction of feedstock
and removal of the products from these reactors. The RTD of the
flow within a given geometry can be considered as a probability
distribution for the time an element of fluid takes to travel within
that geometry [179] . In another word, some chemical species stays

253

less time than other chemicals, and consequently, leave the reac-
tors upon their introduction into reactor through product outlet.

In two main continuous flow reactors, i.e., CSTRs and plug flow
reactors  (PFRs),  the  major  reasons  of  RTD  are  bypassing  stream,
dead  zones,  longitudinal  mixing  induced  by  vortices  and  turbu-
lence, and even the failure of mixing system [180] . It is frequently
favorable to establish plug flow operation rather than continuous
stirred process since it provides very accurate control of the pro-
cessing history, each element of fluid spends exactly the same time
in each condition in the reactor [179] . This reduces by-products as
compounds of fluid are not, for instance, subjected to higher tem-
peratures for any longer than required for the conversion. It also
greatly  decreases  the  size  of  reactor.  Both  undertime  and  over-
time  processes  lead  to  uneconomic  production  of  biodiesel  due
to uncompleted conversion of oil (lower yield) and higher oper-
ating  costs  with  lower  productivity  rate,  respectively.  Moreover,
biodiesel may be evaporated or even degraded during an unaccept-
able lengthy process under harsh conditions.

In a batch reaction, the reaction time is the time after which
the reaction is stopped and mixture is subjected to downstream
processing, i.e., separation, feed recycling, neutralization, and wash-
ing.  In  contrast,  residence  time  for  a  continuous  reaction  is  de-
fined as reactor volume divided by flow rate. Darnoko and Cheryan
[44] attained that variations of the plot of residence time in com-
parison with produced methyl ester from palm oil in a CSTR was so
that with increasing the residence time, the methyl ester yield in-
creased logarithmically. In their study, the optimal residence time
was 60 min. Other researchers claimed that higher residence time
could shift the reaction in the reverse side or biodiesel evapora-
tion, reducing the overall conversion yields [181,182] . Alamu et al.
[183]  studied  30–120 min  reaction  time  (with  15 min  intervals)
for alkaline-catalyzed ethanolysis of palm oil while other param-
eters were kept constant (1 wt.% KOH, 20 wt.% ethanol, 60 °C) and
a plateau of yield (96%) was observed after 90 min. Falahati and
Tremblay  [184]  studied  the  influence  of  flux  and  reaction  time
in the biodiesel synthesis from various feedstocks by means of a
membrane reactor. They reported the reaction time as a main in-
fluential factor affecting the operating pressure in the reactor. The
quantity of unconverted oil in the reactor increased at very low
residence time, enhancing the pressure inside the reactor. In an-
other study, Azam et al. [185] investigated the influences of cat-
alyst loading and reaction time on biodiesel synthesis from palm
oil via micro-tube reactors. The results showed that oil transfor-
mation and FAME yield were proportional to the catalyst loading
and reaction time. This finding could be explained by the complete
methylation process of oil in response to longer reaction times and
efficient  mixing  in  micro-tube  reactor.  Similar  results  have  been
previously  observed  by  Ab  Rashid  et  al.  [186]  and  Rahimi  et  al.
[187] who studied FAME synthesis from palm oil and soybean oil
in a milli- and micro-channel reactors, respectively.

It should be pointed out that the fatty acid compositions of oils
are immune against transesterification reaction, and hence, their
unchanged natures influence some fuel characteristics of biodiesel.
As an example, high amount of saturated fatty esters in beef tallow
oil resulted in a biodiesel with higher cloud point than that of soy-
based biodiesel [191] . The effect of fatty acid composition on cloud
point, cold flow, density, oxidation stability, pour point, and cetane
number of produced biodiesel has also been highlighted in other
studies [190,192–194] . Generally, cetane number, cold filter plug-
ging point, iodine index, oxidation stability index, and cold flow
characteristics improve as the degree of saturation of fatty acid in
oil increases. The FFA content can be decreased to the appropriate
amount for transesterification reaction through acid esterification
process. Pinzi et al. [195] optimized the transesterification of sev-
eral vegetable oils with different fatty-acids compositions (iodine
values) and FFA contents. They analyzed the influence of fatty acid
composition on the production of methyl ester through compari-
son of the obtained optima. Accordingly, it was concluded that the
chain length of fatty acids influences biodiesel yield by controlling
reaction time, with longer chains slowing the process by two times
than shorter chains.

Similarly, higher iodine index of vegetable oils requires higher
concentration of catalyst whereas lower amount of catalyst would
be required for optimum biodiesel yield from vegetable oils with
lower  iodine  index.  Moreover,  higher  amounts  of  saturated  fatty
acids were prone to soap generation in the presence of excess cat-
alyst.  During  conventional  transesterification  of  oil,  this  negative
side-product (soap) appears in larger quantities in presence of wa-
ter. The other negative effect of presence of water is its contribu-
tion to the introduction of a mass of small bubbles in alcohol-oil
mixture in combination with agitation, decreasing the mass trans-
fer. In addition to lower yield, the operating cost would also be in-
creased due to problematic separation of glycerol from biodiesel in
the presence of soap. In contrast to conventional transesterification
reaction, water content would have no significant effect on conver-
sion yield during biodiesel production by SCM technique and even
the yield was reportedly improved with the existence of water at
certain concentrations [196,197] .

Kwiecien  et  al.  [198]  examined  the  effect  of  acidity  on  the
alkaline-catalyzed methylation process by adding various amounts
of oleic acid, one of the most abundant fatty acid in vegetable oils
(up to 80 wt.%), to artificially increase the acid number from about
0.9 to 12.3 mg KOH/g of oil. In each experiment, they calculated the
necessary dose of KOH with respect to acid numbers to keep the
concentration  of  catalyst  constant.  Under  similar  reaction  condi-
tions, the higher acid number of oil deteriorated biodiesel produc-
tion due to both saponification as well as dissolution of biodiesel
into  glycerol  phase.  It  also  required  higher  alkaline  catalyst  and
longer separation time, both of which are directly correlated with
economic aspects of biodiesel synthesis [198] .

2.5. Composition of oil

3. Reactor technologies

The FFA content of feedstock, its composition, and water con-
centration are critical factors markedly affecting biodiesel yield and
quality. These compounds have detrimental effects on yield dur-
ing biodiesel production process, but the extent of their effects de-
pends on production techniques. Generally, higher concentrations
of alkaline catalyst would be required in the reaction in order to
neutralize high FFA contents ( > 1%) or decreased yield should be
expected.  Increasing  the  FFA  content  from  0%  to  4%  resulted  in
2.2% drops in biodiesel yield obtained from WCO [188] . The con-
centration of each fatty acid in oil feedstock determines the prop-
erties and quality of the triglyceride and the resultant biodiesel.
The physical properties of triglycerides and fatty acids are deter-
mined by length of chain and quantity of double bonds [189,190] .

3.1. Biodiesel production process modes

There are four main steps in a typical biodiesel production plant
via oil alcoholysis with an additional step for treatment of glyc-
erol. In the first step, reagents and reactants are added depend-
ing on the process mode into the reactor where the transesterifi-
cation of oil takes place under controlled reaction conditions. Upon
completion of the process, the resultant slurry is allowed to stand
in  a  settling  vessel  (decanter)  or  subjected  to  centrifugation  for
inducing  phase  separation  in  the  second  step.  In  addition,  other
methods of separation such as filtration and sedimentation can be
used [199,200] . In the third step, biodiesel and unreacted alcohol
are sent to an evaporator or a flash unit to separate alcohol from

biodiesel.  Fourth  step  involves  neutralization  and  purification  of
biodiesel from other undesired compounds such as catalyst, soap,
and unreacted triglyceride by using wet or dry washing methods.
In wet washing which is both water- (2–120 L of wastewater/100 L
of  biodiesel)  and  energy-intensive,  the  product  is  neutralized  by
acids  followed  by  treatment  with  water.  Treatment  of  generated
wastewater and drying the final product are also costly processes.
Dry  washing  is  considered  as  a  more  environmental  compatible
approach  compared  with  wet  washing  but  because  of  using  ab-
sorbents and additional equipment, it may not be economical un-
der certain industrial circumstances [201] . Alternatively, the crude
biodiesel  may  be  purified  using  membrane  filtration  which  has
been discussed in detail in Section 4.3.1 . In a subsidiary step, the
generated glycerol is neutralized, washed using soft water, and di-
rected  towards  the  glycerol  refining  section.  For  feedstocks  with
high amounts of FFA, the system should be slightly modified with
the  incorporation  of  an  acid  esterification  unit  and  storage  tank
for the acid catalyst [202] . Batch, semi-batch/semi-continuous, or
continuous process modes are available depending on how these
steps are conducted, each of them having specific cons and pros
( Table 6 ).

The most commonly used method for commercial production
of biodiesel is batch-mode process [136] . In a typical batch process,
there are no streams flowing into and out of the reactor during the
process, and therefore, a finite amount of product is synthesized
in a specific period of time. At the end of batch-mode reactor, the
entire slurry is sent to separation and purification sections. Semi-
batch process mode is a variation of batch-mode process with a
higher  selectivity  and  better  control  on  reaction  temperature,  in
which  as  the  reaction  proceeds,  one  reagent  or  product  may  be
intermittently or continuously added to or removed from the re-
actor,  respectively.  Moreover,  large  methanol-to-oil  ratios  can  be
maintained by gradual or intermittent introduction of one reagent,
i.e., oil to improve the reaction rate and process yield. The reaction
equilibrium can be broken in favor of biodiesel production through
removal of product as well. Similar to the batch-mode process, the
production rate in semi-batch process is limited while operating
cost is relatively high. However, like continuous process, the scale-
up and design is more complex than the batch mode.

In contrast to the batch-mode process, feeds are continuously
introduced  into  the  flow/continuous-mode  reactor  while  product
stream leaving the system. In should be noted that biodiesel in-
dustry is shifting toward continuous process mode in order to ad-
dress disadvantages of batch process operation [203–205] . Despite
of this tendency, batch processes still contribute to major portion
of the biodiesel production plants worldwide as it is the process of
choice in small and medium scale biodiesel synthesis plants. It is
worthy of mention that continuous processes offer lower operat-

ing costs whereas delivering higher quality and uniform products
[128] .

3.2. Types of chemical reactors for biodiesel production

Several types of reactors are available for biodiesel production
through transesterification of oils, each of which allows different
operating conditions with respect to chemical nature of reactants,
reagents,  and  products  as  well  as  physical  parameters  of  opera-
tion. These factors, together with the optimum pressure and tem-
perature of reaction and production size (reaction mode), define
the  choice  of  reactor.  In  general,  any  reactor  types  should  pro-
vide appropriate residence time, heat exchange, and mass trans-
fer for efficient product formation. Reactors are classified based on
phase numbers, existence of mixing systems, and process modes.
Flow chart of various chemical reactors for biodiesel production is
shown in Fig. 4 .

Table 7 summarizes the operating conditions under which sev-
eral types of reactors have been proven to perform desirably. The
feasibility of these reactors for application in biodiesel industry is
also highlighted. Although batch STR and CSTR have been reported
to be of low efficiency and difficult to control, they are extensively
applied at industrial scale due to their simplicity and low cost na-
ture.

3.2.1. Tubular/plug-flow reactors

The  simplest  chemical  reactor  is  tubular,  also  known  as  pipe
or PFR, in which reactants and reagents are entered in one end,
spent  specific  time  for  passing  through  pipes  at  a  constant  ve-
locity,  and  mixed  while  flowing  towards  the  outlet.  This  mixing
can  be  performed  successfully  by  passing  highly  turbulent  flow
through  empty  pipes  and  piping  fittings  (such  as  elbows).  The
length of mixing device as well as its time is significantly reduced
by adjusting pressure. However, more laminar flow operating con-
ditions  are  resulted  in  tubular  reactors  when  fluid  viscosity  in-
creases. To avoid this, and also to further improve the reaction time
and size of reactor, side stream additive injection devices (imping-
ing jet mixer, spray nozzle, Tee mixer), in-line mechanical mixer, or
static mixer can be applied. Static/motionless mixers take advan-
tage of stream energy to impose efficient radial mixing of two or
more immiscible liquids when these fluids pass through it ( Fig. 5 )
[216,217] .

In the simplest configuration ( Fig. 5 A), static mixing can be ob-
tained through tubular reactor with horizontal back-and-forth and
vertical upflow-and-downflow configurations. Other configurations
( Fig. 5 B–F) includes installation of static mixing element inside a

perature, Reynolds number, and viscosity of fluids. These config-
urations  are  suitable  for  both  low  and  high  viscosity  fluids  and
the subsequent increase in polar-apolar interfacial area, particularly
through local micromixing, significantly facilitates the transesteri-
fication of oils. Compared with a tank or vessel reactors, pipe re-

actors with/without static mixing internals provide more efficient
and economic place for blending when quick mixing, short hold-
ups, and low maintenance are desirable.

Tubular reactors require lower capital as well as space for con-
struction. However, these reactors have a limitation for Reynolds

3.2.1.1. Packed  bed  reactors.  PBRs  are  popular  reactors  for  the
production  of  biodiesel  by  heterogonous  catalysts  (including  ba-
sic,  acidic,  ion  exchange  resins,  and  superacids  active  catalysts)
with  the  ability  to  switch  into  supercritical  mode.  Packed  bed
can  provide  a  great  substrate  for  enzyme  immobilization  in  the
transesterification  process  as  well.  Some  support  particles  such
as  magnetic  magnetite  nanoparticle,  poly(stearyl  methacrylate-
co -ethylene dimethacrylate) monolith grafted with vinylazlactone,
or  polyurethane  foam  have  been  successfully  utilized  in  lipase-
catalyzed PBRs [234–236] . PBR is in fact a PFR filled by roughly
equal size of solid packing materials (such as catalysts, activated
carbon, etc .). The catalyst size distribution and bed structure deter-
mine the accessible surface area, void spaces, and therefore, trans-
port and performance of the system. As PBRs consist of fixed or
immobilized bed of catalyst, they are also called fixed bed reac-
tors.

The packing process in these reactors is controlled by (i) phys-
ical characteristics of container (pipe) and particle (catalyst), such
as shape, size, and surface properties; (ii) the intensity, method,
and speed of deposition; and (iii) treatment approach [237] . Un-
desirable flow distribution and pressure variations must be mini-
mized by avoiding particles charging, segregation, and their irreg-
ular distribution during bed generation. Moreover, bed shrinkage
phenomenon as well as packing reproducibility must be improved
by  applying  appropriate  procedures  such  as  snow  storm  filling
method. During loading, the free fall distance should be < 50 cm to
avoid significant damage to catalysts. Compared with PFRs, PBRs
allow higher conversions of oils per unit mass of solid catalysts in
shorter reaction time because the liquid flow is close to ideal plug
flow [238] . A very high operation pressure can be applied in PBRs
with high ratios of L/D because of absence of mixing system. An-
other advantage of PBRs is that the catalysts are fixed in the pipes
(reactors), and hence, no downstream process would be required
for their separation.

In spite of the advantages mentioned, PBRs are suffering from
several pressure drops during operation attributed to a number of
factors  namely,  friction  of  fluid  around  as  well  as  its  expansion
and contraction through spaces among packing particles, length of
reactor,  and  fluid  viscosity.  These  pressure  drops  would  increase
the  operation  cost  as  higher  energy  in  form  of  pressure  would
be required. On the other hand, increasing pressure could break
the  catalysts  into  small  fragments.  These  minute  particles  could
plug the spaces between pellets, and in turn, lead to pressure drop
again. Therefore, based on intended process, catalysts with resis-
tant shape configuration and higher surface area must be applied
in PBRs. For instance, solid cylinders are pressure-resistant while
providing 14.5% < higher surface area as well as 25% less voidage
values than spheres of same volume [237] . Raschig rings (hollow
cylinders) are even better than solid cylinder owing to their posi-
tive influence on system pressure and providing extra surface area
(20–30%) [237,239,240] . Nevertheless, the number and size of ax-
ially extruded holes must be optimized for better performance of
hollow cylinders.

The RTD in PBRs narrows with increasing the ratio of bed depth
to the diameter of particle ( L/d p ), and is almost negligible at the ra-
tio greater than 40 [238] . The application of larger catalyst size as
well as lower liquid-solid mass transfer coefficients reduces the ef-
ficiency of PBRs [238] . In PBRs, a feed pipe and a distribution hood
are applied prior to the flow of feedstock into the tube bundle or
fixed bed in order to prevent flow bypasses. In better words, when
there  is  no  formation  of  flow  bypasses,  there  is  a  significantly
greater pressure loss in the entrance hood than in the tube bun-
dle or fixed bed leading to uniform traverse of liquid with equal
residence time in each tube [239] . Although PBRs are considered
as continuous operation, however, since recycling of the ingredi-
ents might be necessary in most cases, therefore, by nature they

numbers,  which  is  necessary  for  appropriate  generation  of  high
velocity  and  suitable  turbulence.  Therefore,  the  ratio  of  length
to  diameter  ( L/D )  should  be  greater  than  20  and  200  for  tur-
bulent  and  laminar  flows,  respectively  [218] .  It  should  be  noted
that  the  RTD  narrows  as  the  ratio  of  L/D  grows  [218] .  Nar-
row  RTDs  as  well  as  large  ratios  of  pipe  wall  to  pipe  vol-
ume  lead  to  efficient  heat  transfer.  Moreover,  these  reactors  ex-
perience  significant  temperature  changes  at  different  points  be-
tween inlet and outlet. To address this phenomenon, appropriate
heating  systems  such  as  heating  jacket  or  radiation  heating  ex-
change must be used during their application in the transesteri-
fication process. Similar to temperature, pressure drop is also ob-
served  at  different  points  inside  tubular  reactors,  which  is  cor-
related  with  viscosity  of  fluid,  length  of  pipe,  and  the  presence
of  internals.  The  drop  in  pressure  reduces  both  mass  and  heat
transfers.

Overall, tubular reactors can best be exploited under high pres-
sures and continuous mode with steady-state condition of reagents
injection rates and concentration of small size solid particles (cata-
lysts, immobilized enzymes, etc. ). The products are separated from
discharged feed, and then methanol and untreated oils are recy-
cled to the feedstock storage. The advantages and disadvantages of
various types of PFRs are presented in Table 8 whereas Table 9 pro-
vides some examples of these reactors for biodiesel production via
transesterification of oil.

have to be performed under batch mode [241] . For isothermal pro-
cess (such as transesterification of oils), PBRs are commonly used
in  multi-tubular  arrangements,  in  which  heat  carrier,  i.e.,  liquid
(water, molten salt) or gas externally circulates around the tubes
containing  the  catalyst  and  through  an  external  heat  exchanger
[234–236,239] .

3.2.1.2. Fluidized  bed  reactors.  Liquid-solid  FBRs,  also  known  as
expanded  bed  reactors,  are  used  for  transesterification  reaction.
These reactors consist of a reservoir for preparing the liquid feed-
stock,  prior  to  being  pumped  into  the  FBR  column.  The  column
consists of a calming section for equalizing liquid flow, followed
by a distributor, a fluidized bed ( i.e., catalyst bed), and freeboard.
The length of calming section is up to several times of fluidized
column, filled with immobilized packings (rings, saddles, spheres)
or even fluidized bed packing (catalyst, immobilized enzyme), and
has  a  wire  screen  at  the  bottom  [242] .  Distributor  must  gener-
ate a sufficiently large frictional pressure drop across itself, com-
pared with the one occurring across the fluidized bed. Above the
distributor, a laterally-directed uniform distribution of longitudinal
liquid  velocity  must  be  formed.  Multi-layer  metal  gauze  or  sin-
tered metal glass plate are two examples of good liquid distrib-
utors  [242] .  Calming  section  and  distributor  reduce  or  eliminate
channeling or bulk circulation in catalyst bed.

FBRs are similar to PBRs  in many ways; however, their main
difference is that solid particles in the reaction vessel of FBR are
suspended by the upward-flowing drag of incoming gas or liquid
[242] .  In  this  case,  solid  particles  inside  the  bed  show  a  liquid-
like  behavior,  allowing  even  fluid  distribution,  uniform  tempera-
ture,  and  vigorous  mixing  with  higher  heat  and  mass  transfers
than in PBRs. Moreover, plugging is less likely to happen because
foreign objects can be separated based on their density differences

from  packing  particles,  i.e.,  heavier  objects  sink  whereas  lighter
ones float [241] . For selection of proper packing particles, in ad-
dition to intrinsic static characteristics (density, shape, size), dy-
namic behavior of particles with respect to flow of fluid (buoyancy
factor, drag coefficient, terminal velocity) must also be considered
[242] .  At  low  fluid  velocities,  the  particles  in  the  vessel  remain
still as the fluid passes within the voids in the material, similar
to the PBRs. As the fluid velocity increases and at a specific veloc-
ity, drag forces will dominate the weight force so that the particles
are capable of initial upward movement. This stage can be con-
sidered as incipient fluidization and takes places at this minimum
fluidization  velocity  [243] .  Once  this  minimum  velocity  is  sur-
passed, particles begin to expand and swirl around in fluidized bed
[244] . Next to fluidized bed is a freeboard that prevents the flow-
ing of catalysts out of the column. Based on the operating condi-
tions and characteristics of solid phase, different flow regimes such
as inverse fluidization, upward fluidization, or vertical moving flu-
idized systems (continuous fluidization) can be used. Internal or
external liquid-fluidized bed heat exchangers arranged either ver-
tically or horizontally may be used to control reaction temperature.
Alternatively, a pre-heating line can be used for this purpose. Com-
pared with PBRs, intense mixing in FBRs could cause high attri-
tion of catalysts due to particle-fluid, particle-particle, and particle-
wall contacts forming solid fines. The elutriation and entrainment
of these solid fines could lead to significant operational challenges
[242] .

3.2.1.3. Trickle bed reactor.  TBRs provide a structure for contact of
solid, liquid, and gas based on gravity or pressure forces. Liquid
feed is supplied at the top of the column which flows downward
over a solid catalyst bed forming droplets or fine films. The pro-
cess may be in either continuous or semi-continuous modes with

a different study, Meng et al. [233] carried out the methanolysis
of rapeseed oil in a TBR consisting of a packed bed of alkaline het-
erogeneous Ca/Al composite oxide-based catalyst with a 91 mL cat-
alyst bed volume. A biodiesel yield of 94.5% was achieved using re-
spective methanol and oil flow rates of 0.3 mL/min and 0.6 mL/min
at 65 °C. The advantages and disadvantages of TBRs are previously
presented in Table 8 .

3.2.1.4. Oscillatory flow reactors.  OFR are another type of vertical or
horizontal continuous tubular reactors consisting of one or several
tubes (continuous OFR; Fig. 7 ) each with equally distanced baffles.
Bellows, diaphragms, or pistons at one or both of tube/s ends are
used to generate oscillatory flow with periodic changes in flow di-
rection ( Fig. 7 ). A vortex mixing is produced and fills almost the
whole cross section of baffles’ downstream cavity because of di-
recting or obstructing fluids by the baffles. This phenomenon also
occurs in the opposite side of the baffles after reversing the bulk
flow. The flow reversal cycle is repeated causing an efficient mixing
due to interaction with the opposite vortices formed in the previ-
ous oscillation cycle [245] . Technically, in OFRs, each zone located
between two baffles acts as a stirred tank. Therefore, a relatively
ideal PFR can be obtained by implementing a sufficient number of
baffles in series [125] . The interaction of bulk and imposed oscilla-
tory velocities controls the RTD through intensifying radial mixing,
which in turn improves heat and mass transfer under low shear
and convenient global mixing conditions [125,209,246,247] . In gen-
eral, OFR configuration allows vigorous mixing control using baffle
geometry and feeding pulsation.

Standard meso-OFRs contain tubes of less than 15 mm in diam-
eter  and commonly  orifice  baffles,  requiring low bulk  flow  rates
of several millimeters per hour to maintain plug flow. Moreover,
various  baffle  geometries  such  as  central  axial,  helical,  integral,
and wire wool configurations are available for meso-OBRs to max-
imize mixing characteristics or to minimize frictional loss ( Fig. 8 )
[245,248] . Integral baffle configuration provides very smooth con-
striction and is generally used for shear-labile reactions while the
central axial baffle has found applications for single phase reac-
tions and provides higher shears than the integral one. In contrast,
wire  wool  configuration  and  helical  baffles  with  a  central  insert
design are advantageous for facilitating inter-phase dispersion of
two-phase liquid-liquid systems (such as methanol and oil in the
transesterification reaction). Other helical baffles can also be ap-
plied in various oscillation conditions for the production of an ef-
ficient plug flow.

Unlike  conventional  PFRs,  mixing  in  OFRs  is  directly  depen-
dent on oscillatory conditions rather than Reynolds number of the
bulk flow through the reactor. This would make possible success-
ful completion of time-consuming reactions, such as transesterifi-
cation of oil, in continuous compact tubular type reactor with sig-
nificantly short L/D ratios. Consequently, these advantages lead to
lower capital cost, lower operation cost (control, pumping, main-
tenance), improved yield of biodiesel, and lower reaction time. In
OBRs, ratio of baffle spacing, open area of baffle flow, oscillatory
and bulk flows, Reynolds numbers, Strouhal number, and velocities
ratio of oscillatory to bulk flows determine the oscillatory condi-
tions  and  the  fluid  mechanics.  The  first  two  parameters  control
eddy expansion and width, respectively, with optimum length of
baffles to reactor inner diameter of 1–2 ( l
b / D ; commonly 1.5) and
square ratio of baffle constriction diameter to reactor inner diam-
eter of 0.2–0.4 [245,249] . An efficient mixing can be obtained by
thinner baffles (1–3 mm), since thicker ones lead to vortex distor-
tion  from  lengthy  surface  adhesion  [250] .  Moreover,  it  has  been
stated by Ni and Stevenson [251] that smaller gap sizes between
the tube and baffles increases the axial dispersion coefficient, per-
haps by preventing the generation of a second vortex ring. Com-
pared with PFRs which require Reynolds number of 2100 for gen-

concurrent or countercurrent flow of gas and liquid flows. Various
equipment designs are possible for TBRs; however, the examined
design for biodiesel production consists of a tubular tank with a
support structure (wire mesh, sieve plate) for packed bed hetero-
geneous catalyst close to the bottom of the reactor ( Fig. 6 ). The
hold-up of the liquid, and hence, biodiesel yield can be improved
by increasing the height of packed bed as well as by decreasing
feed flow rate. The oil is fed from top of the column whereas the
methanol can be fed from either top or bottom points. The desired
temperature, i.e., higher than boiling point of methanol is main-
tained by heating jackets (exterior heaters) on the reactor wall or
heating coil in the packed bed (interior heaters). Moreover, the un-
reacted methanol is separated from products by a separate heating
system placed at the bottom of TBRs. As the result of this heating
system, methanol is completely vaporized at this point and starts
rising in the column. A gas distributor breaks the methanol vapor
into bubbles prior to its direct introduction into the packed bed
catalyst, which causes intense mixing and dispersion of oil droplets
within the bed before they are collected and refluxed by an up-
stream condenser. Similarly, an even distribution of liquid through-
out the bed is maintained by using a bubble cap, fine layer of inert
particles, or sieve plate distributor prior to packed bed.

There are two outlets in TBRs; one on top of the reactor for
methanol gas recycling while the other one is located at the bot-
tom  of  the  reactor  for  liquids  (products  and  unreacted  oil).  The
application of TBR configuration for transesterification of oils into
biodiesel  has  been  reported  in  a  few  studies  only.  For  instance,
Son  and  Kusakabe  [232]  continuously  produced  sunflower-based
biodiesel with 98% yield using a TBR with a calcium oxide packed
bed  (1–2 mm  in  diameter  and  125 mm  in  thickness)  at  100 °C,
methanol flow rate of 3.8 mL/h, and oil flow rate of 4.1 mL/h. In

flow, mainly diffusion, rather than a turbulence flow, making the
movement of chemical species predictable and the reaction calcu-
lable [256] . However, for an efficient molecular diffusion, a lengthy
path is required. To address this challenge and to facilitate molec-
ular  diffusion  while  the  diffusion  path  is  shortened,  passive  mi-
cromixers could be employed to improve contact surface between
two or more liquids [257] . This type of micromixers can be applied
as microfluidic working with no need for external force. They are
categorized with respect to the arrangement of mixed phases into
Dean vortices, droplet, injection, and lamination (parallel and se-
rial) [257,258] . Moreover, some passive mixing channels with spe-
cial geometries, called chaotic advection, can also induce advection
through breaking, folding, splitting, and stretching ( Fig. 9 ).

In  parallel  lamination,  the  inlet  streams  are  split  into  sev-
eral narrow sub-streams, which are subsequently merged into one
stream as laminae. Under this concept, the basic configurations are
T-shaped or Y-shaped micro-channels ( Fig. 9 ) [257] .

Serial lamination micromixers use the same concept as parallel
lamination micromixers, i.e., splitting the inlet streams and joining
them later. However, in serial lamination micromixers, the merging
occurs horizontally first, followed by vertically [257] .

In  injection  micromixers,  the  oil  stream  is  split  into  sub-
streams. Then, alcohol is injected through an array of nozzles that
are present on the top of one stream [257] . Droplet micromixers
use an internal flow field for the production and transportation of
the mixed liquids droplets by capillary effects, pressure, and flow
instability between two immiscible liquids [257,259,260] .

Although  clogging  and  corrosion  impose  considerable  chal-
lenges in the application of micro-channel reactors, the main dis-
advantage of using these reactors for biodiesel production is their
very small liquid capacity [255] . A process known as numbering-up
is used to address this issue by increasing the number of channels,
and hence, volumetric capacity [255] . However, the shortcomings
associated with this solution are channels arrangement in the re-
actor as well as uniform distribution of fluids through them. Kobe
Steel  Company  designed  a  large-capacity  micro-channel  reactor,
called stacked multichannel reactors (SMCR ®), to solve these prob-
lems with the help of plates consisting of parallel multi-channels
on either side. The channels on both sides are then connected to
each  other  through  a  through-hole.  Either  T-shaped or  Y-shaped
mixing can be applied by combining channel configurations in the
mixing part. A characteristic flow pattern in micro-channel reac-
tor is slug flow, i.e., the alternate arrangement of immiscible fluids
(methanol and oil) in channels and large specific interfacial area.
Other flow conditions including two-layer flow and annular flow

eration of flow separation, i.e., transition to turbulent flow, meso-
OBRs produce similar conditions with oscillatory Reynolds number
of just 50 [245,246,252] . For biodiesel reaction screening purpose
(such as selection/comparison of solid catalysts), novel meso-OBRs
with lower diameters (4.4-5 mm) than the above-mentioned stan-
dard ones could be applied to save construction as well as feed-
stock  costs.  In  these  OBRs,  oscillatory  Reynolds  number  of  10  is
sufficient to generate turbulent flow [245] .

It should be mentioned that axi-symmetrical vortex rings are
formed  in  each  baffle  cavity  during  each  fluid  oscillation  with
oscillatory  Reynolds  numbers  of  100  and  250  in  novel-  or  stan-
dard  meso-OBRs,  respectively  [245,252,253] .  These  chaotic,  non-
axisymmetric, and intensely mixed flows generated within cavities
could enhance axial mixing in a way similar to STRs. Velocity ratio
of oscillatory to bulk flows must be more than one for efficient full
flow reversal [246] . The Strouhal number is in inverse relationship
with eddy formation; hence, a Strouhal number lower than 0.13
would be required for an intense eddy formation and the subse-
quent appropriate vortex generation in the adjacent baffle cavities
[245,254] .

3.2.1.5. Micro-channel reactors.  Mirco-channel reactors (also known
as micro-reactors or micro-structured reactors) use numerous nar-
row channels of millimeter range diameter allowing high surface-
to-volume  ratios  and  short  diffusion  distances  for  effective  heat
and  mass  transfer.  According  to  Table  10 ,  such  configuration  re-
sults in rapid reaction rates with high yields of up to 99.5–100%.
Accurate temperature control, continuous mode, energy efficiency,
and quick phase separation are among its other advantages [255] .
All of these features are ascribed to the occurrence of a laminar

are also possible ( Fig. 10 ). The main factors affecting the final re-
sult of the reaction in the aforesaid systems were reported to be
micro-channel size, mixing mechanism, residence time, and reac-
tion temperature [255] .

Martinez  et  al.  [261]  compared  the  impact  of  different  inter-
nal  geometries  (omega,  T-shaped,  Tesla)  on  the  performance  of
micro-channel reactors for ethanolysis of castor oil. Among them,
the Tesla-shaped micro-channel reactor showed the most favorable
performance  by  reaching  96.7%  biodiesel  yield.  In  another  study
on the mass transfer simulation of biodiesel production in micro-
channel reactors, higher residence time and lower micro-channel
reactor height (higher ratio of surface area to volume) were found
as significant factors [262] . Table 10 summarizes recent experimen-

tal research works conducted on biodiesel production using micro-
channel reactors.

3.2.2. Rotating reactors

Mechanical agitation facilitates the mass and heat transfer, de-
creases the hold-up of reactants and reagents, and allows the uti-
lization of more efficient (usually costlier) materials in the fabri-
cation  of  resulting  smaller-sized  reactors.  Rotating  reactors  have
single  or  multiple  rotating  elements  with  various  configurations
(discs, impellers, tubes, etc. ) and rotational characteristics (power,
speed). Various types of rotating reactors suitable for transesterifi-
cation of oil have been discussed in this section.

3.2.2.1. Stirred tank reactors.  In general, a STR is a cylindrical vessel
equipped with a central shaft which harbors one or more stirrers.
Lack of mixing is usually observed in tanks of large sizes especially
when multiphase reactions occur. This poor mixing can affect the
rates of mass transfer and reaction [273] . Two forms of catalyst dis-
persion in a stirred tank are considered, including heterogeneous
and homogeneous forms. Heat transfer in stirred tanks is managed
through external jackets or by applying coils inside the tank. Al-
though the application of internal coils provide higher rates of heat
transfer in system, it can cause some issues such as increasing the
possibility of fouling, disturbance of mixing, and difficulties in re-
actor cleaning.

Various  methods  have  been  developed  to  enhance  mixing  in
STRs.  For  example,  bottom  to  top  movement  of  mixture  is  hin-
dered  by  using  vertical  wall  baffles  fasten  on  the  inner  wall  of
the tank. The four most common stirrer types used in reactors are
turbine, impeller, monolithic, and foam stirrers [274] . Additionally,
more complicated stirrers such as Rushton stirrer can also be used
to improve the mixing intensity. Rushton stirrer is a kind of turbine
mixers that has been in use since 1940s [274] . This stirrer consists
of six vertical blades placed on a disc, generating a radial flow in
mixture. Physical characteristics of mixture and geometry of vessel
mainly determine the power properties of this stirrer [275] .

Gas-distributing inlets can also be used for improving the mix-
ing rate in stirred tanks [274] . For instance, gas-inducing impellers
could introduce an unreactive gas phase to the liquid phase in a
reactor  in  order  to  enhance  mixing  and  productivity  [276] .  In  a
CSTR with a gas-inducing impeller, electrical capacitance tomog-
raphy (ECT) could also be used for monitoring the gas flow in the
liquid phase and consequently to increase the efficiency of the gas
distribution in the system, further improving mixing times and re-
action parameters [277] . Another type of mixing system used in
CSTRs is the monolithic stirrer suitable for reactions with dispersed
catalysts. This type of stirrer consists of a ceramic part with many
channels placed in parallel. The first idea for developing monolithic
stirrers was presented by Albers et al. [278] for low viscose mix-
tures. Immobilization of enzymatic catalyst or other types of cata-
lysts inside the channels may be an advantage of monolithic stir-
rers. In addition, there is no need for catalyst separation step while
immobilizing the catalysts inside the channels [279,280] .

Solid foam stirrer is a more recent stirrer, which consists of two
foam blocks with a reticulated structure. The blocks possess high
surface area providing an ideal situation for catalyst immobiliza-
tion. It has been demonstrated that tanks equipped with foam stir-
rer present higher yields of liquid-solid and gas-liquid mass trans-
fer [281,282] . Some examples of STRs are presented in Table 11 .

Batch stirred tank reactor. As mentioned earlier, BSTR was the
premier biodiesel production technology and is still very popular
for industrial-scale production processes. For a batch process in a
ideally stirred tank, the reaction rate is the same as the changes
in reactants or product/s concentrations [238] . Fig. 11 represents a
schematic illustration of a typical batch stirred reactor.

Fig. 11.  A schematic illustration of a typical batch stirred reactor.

Batch  reactors  are  classically  composed  of  a  mixed  tank  in
which  a  reaction  is  initiated  by  adding  the  reactants  and  cata-
lysts and proceeds during a determined time. Batch reactors were
extensively used at the initiation of chemical industry era dating
back to the seventeenth and the eighteenth centuries. Along with
the development of the chemical industry in the twentieth cen-
tury, continuous reactors were introduced and employed in vari-
ous industries. In spite of that, batch reactors still possess some
significant kinetic features as well as advantages making them as
an important system for various reactions ( Table 6 ).

Batch reaction systems are frequently developed by direct scale
up  from  laboratory  trials.  If  the  feed  concentration  and  reaction
temperature  are  kept  identical  to  the  lab  operational  condition,
similar residence time is often needed for the same reaction since
the reaction rate (kmol/hr/m 3 or lb mol/hr/ft 3 ) does not vary with
the reactor volume. The minimum required reactor volume could
be determined on the basis of the yearly desired production rate
and the time for a complete batch cycle, including times for charg-
ing the reactants, heating, reaction, product discharge, and clean-
ing. A slightly larger reactor than standard size might be chosen
for a different run schedule or increases in production rate [238] .

A critical factor to reach high productivities in batch systems is
the precise calculation of the time required for complete conver-
sion of reagents into products. In a batch system, optimum tem-
perature  profiles  are  determined  through  the  chemistry  of  reac-
tion. For instance, in exothermic reversible reactions, temperature
is adjusted to increase with initiation of reaction so that the pro-
cess proceeds in the desired pathway. Thereafter, the temperature
decreases with certain time to inhibit the reduction in chemical
equilibrium constant. The temperature profile is different for en-
dothermic reversible reactions. Under this condition, temperature
increases quickly as much as possible to the highest amount be-
cause raise of chemical equilibrium constant depends on tempera-
ture elevation.

In a batch operation, the concentration of reagents is in their
maximum amounts at the beginning of the reaction which causes
a high reaction rate that needs high heat transfer load. The pro-
cess  must  be  checked  frequently  because  the  batch  system  is  a
time-varying process in which main parameters can change with
time.  Thus,  applying  control  planning  such  as  “gain  scheduling”
is needed during the process. A non-linear model is used for an-
alyzing  batch  reactors  while  in  a  condition  close  to  steady-state
level which occurs in continuous systems, a linear model is usually
used [288] . The non-linear behavior of batch process contributes to
complexity in reaction kinetics that leads to inaccurate measure-
ments. Consequently, this would prevent complete optimization of
conditions to obtain maximum productivity and economic benefits.
Overall, a batch system can be operated optimally through two ap-
proaches.  The  first  is  to  specify  optimal  set  points  of  significant
process parameters such as temperature of reaction and the sec-
ond step is to monitor the system through a controlling approach
to obtain the optimal profile [289,290] . Modeling errors are usually
unavoidable due to external disturbances and complex conditions
of batch systems affecting the final products yield. To solve these
problems in control process, often on-line optimization has been
used to efficiently estimate the desired profile [291] . Examples of
BSTR for biodiesel synthesis using transesterification of oil are pro-
vided in Table 11 .

CSTR. A CSTR is simply a vessel equipped with feed input (inlet),
product outlet (output), an agitator, as well as cooling and heating
jacket. It is more suitable for the industrial scale biodiesel produc-
tion [206] due to several benefits over batch operation as elabo-
rated in Table 6 . This reaction system can make products contin-
uously every time it is run, whereas a typical BSTR is operational
for only about half the time of CSTR. CSTR can be integrated with
other reactor types to improve effectiveness. For example, PBR in
the forms of columns have been integrated with mixing/rotating
nature of CSTR reactors to develop a simple rotating PBR (RPBR)
( Fig. 12 ). The enhancement achieved in mass transfer in RPBRs is
due to the decline in boundary layer of reactants over the hetero-
geneous catalysts, and the subsequent reduction in mass transfer
resistance  [292] .  More  complex  RPBRs  are  discussed  in  detail  in
Section “3.2.2.2 ”.

In the CSTR configuration, controlling temperature is straight-
forward than in the BSTR configuration due to the fact that the
reaction rate is fixed and the heat release rate does not vary with
time [238] . Finally, conversion and selectivity may show batch-to-
batch variations in a batch reaction system, whereas they are more
likely to be fixed in a CSTR system with appropriate controlling
means [238] . A CSTR system is generally modeled with respect to
conditions in which there are no variations in temperature, con-
centration, or reaction rate throughout the vessel. Composition and
temperature  of  output  stream  are  exactly  the  same  as  the  mix-
ture in the tank throughout the reaction. This feature is also true

for concentration of reactants/reagents in both vessel contents and
stream of products. The rate of conversion and quantity of reac-
tants are in a reverse relation, in better words, a high rate of con-
version needs a low amount of reactants. Apparently, the reaction
rate is highly dependent on primary throughput of reagents. This
issue can be solved thorough increasing the volume of reactor ves-
sel [288] .

The  design  of  appropriate  controlling  strategy,  which  is  im-
portant  for  achieving  maximum  conversion  possible  with  mini-
mum cost, is very challenging in CSTRs due to highly second or-
der complex non-linear dynamics [242] . Accordingly, external dis-
turbance  attenuation,  one  relative  degree,  state  estimation,  and
zero dynamics are four difficult issues in controlling CSTR. Feed-
back linearization, general predictive control, multi-model control,
proportional-integral-derivative controller, Taylor-linearization, and
terminal sliding mode control model have all been used for con-
trolling different parameters of CSTRs applied for biodiesel produc-
tion [293–297] . Zhao et al. [297] have designed two new output
integral terminal sliding mode strategies, namely sign integral ter-
minal sliding mode control and fraction integral terminal sliding

wire screen was used to prevent their washing from this cham-
ber. The volumetric flow rate of 4 L/min was found as the optimum
value for suspending the catalyst within the chamber and elimi-
nating external mass transfer resistance [287] . It was found that
jet velocity and Reynolds number were appropriately raised at this
flow rate. Similar to the previously explained study [207] , the low-
est diameter of examined nozzle (2 mm) also provided better yield
of biodiesel by providing a higher Reynolds number. The internoz-
zle distance influenced the collision of the jets; and therefore, sus-
pension of the solid catalyst within the chamber. The distances of
0.5 and 1 cm were reportedly appropriate for the complete suspen-
sion of catalyst, and hence for the maximum reaction rate [287] . A
biodiesel yield about 76% was obtained under optimum transes-
terification conditions (4 wt.% KOH/ γ -Al
3 , 15:1 methanol-to-oil
ratio, 65 °C, 3 h) [287] .

Overall,  JSRs  are  more  suitable  for  heterogeneous  catalyzed-
transesterification  reactions,  compared  with  mechanical  stirrers
due to protecting structures of solid catalysts.

3.2.2.2. Rotating/spinning  tubes  reactors.  Rotating  tube  reactors.
Rotating tube reactors (RTRs) use tubular geometry with low shear
stress. To fulfill that, they rotate a moveable hollow cylinder with
a typical rotational speed of less than 10 0 0 rpm. In these reactors,
a  sheared  thin  liquid  film  (0.7–1.4 mm  in  thickness)  is  formed,
which improves mass and heat transfers by significantly elevating
the  ratio  of  surface  area  to  volume  (about  10 0 0:1)  as  well  as
generating  a  small  conduction  path  length  [48,302] .  Therefore,
together with low pressure drop over the cylinder as well as sim-
ple design, RTRs are capable of providing a suitable basis for bulk
transesterification processes. This technology has been successfully
examined  by  Lodha  et  al.  [302]  for  continuous  production  and
separation  of  canola-based  biodiesel  in  the  presence  of  NaOH.
They  injected  a  mixture  of  methanol  and  oil  into  an  RTR  and
controlled  the  temperature  by  means  of  cooling/heating  jacket.
Under  optimized  conditions  (1.5 wt.%  NaOH,  1:6  methanol-to-oil
molar ratio, 900 mL/min flow rate, 40–65 °C, 670 rpm, 45 s), a high
oil to biodiesel conversion rate of 97.6% was obtained. The result
was very promising compared with membrane reactors (480-time
longer  residence  time,  147.5-times  lower  flow  rate)  as  well  as
CSTRs  (eight-time  longer  residence  time,  2.4-times  lower  flow
rate) [302–304] .

Rotating bed reactors. RPBR ( Fig. 14 ) are the most common type
of  rotating  bed  device  in  HiGee  technology  that  has  been  men-
tioned  in  the  literature.  Other  rotating  devices  are  also  possible
which  include  blade  packing  rotating  packed  bed,  counter-flow
concentric-ring  rotating  bed,  crossflow  concentric-baffle  rotating
bed, rotating fluidized bed, rotating zigzag bed, rotating bed with
blade packing and baffles, single-block rotating packed bed, split-
packing  rotating  bed,  two-stage  counter-current  rotating  packed
bed  [305] .  RPBR  is  an  intensified  variation  of  PBR  in  which  a
centrifugal  force  is  applied  to  facilitate  alcohol-oil  interface,  mi-
cromixing (molecular scale mixing of two liquids), and mass trans-
fer  while  reducing  both  height  and  volume  of  the  conventional
PBR up to 10.5–11.1 times [306] . It has been reported that mass
transfer  coefficients  have  inverse  relations  with  average  lifetime
of  liquid  film  [306] .  In  fact,  a  resistance  is  observed  when  sur-
faces  of  two  immiscible  fluids  (such  as  alcohol  and  oil)  are  ap-
proaching each other, forming a liquid film [307] . In the case of
pure  miscible  liquids,  zero  lifetime  of  liquid  film,  i.e.,  no  resis-
tance is encountered and the surfaces immediately mix and van-
ish.  In  RPBRs,  the  most  important  part  of  the  reactor  for  mass
transfer is the end-effect zone of packing. More specifically, RPBR
produces  a  high  energy  dissipation  region  and  passes  the  liquid
stream through it [308,309] . This part extend from the inner edge
of  the  packing  to  the  capture  site  of  liquid,  by  the  rotary  pack-
ing  [306] .  Maximum  relative  velocity,  between  liquid  and  rotat-

mode  control,  with  powerful  robustness  to  system  disturbances.
In a different study, an event triggered sliding mode control was
designed by Sinha and Mishra [298] for maintaining the tempera-
ture and concentration states of an CSTR at equilibrium points. This
controller was in a relaxed status when the predefined conditions
were not violated and could provide stability in the system with
lower computational load and cost within a short period of time.

Jet-stirred reactors. The main advantage of JSRs over PFRs and
shock  tubes  is  that  both  time  and  space  are  zero-dimensional
whereas  in  the  latter  two  reactors,  only  one  parameter  can  be
zero-dimensional. Potentially, the mixing time is shorter than res-
idence time and both can be dissociated from each other in a JSR.
In  contrast,  mixing  and  residence  times  can  never  be  separated
in PFRs [299,300] . However, JSRs have been rarely employed for
biodiesel production from natural oils and fats.

As an example, Reyes et al. [207] developed a self-heating batch
transesterification reaction system using two-impinging-jet-flow as
hydrodynamic agitation driving force and converted soybean and
sunflower oils (85:15 wt.% blend) into biodiesel in the presence of
1 wt.% of NaOH at methanol to-oil molar ratio of 6:1 ( Fig. 13 ). They
obtained more than 90% relative biodiesel yield in the first 5 min
of the process while this value was increased to 98% after 60 min
of residence time. The reactor consisted of a 9-L tank connected to
two centrifugal pumps at the conical bottom. These pumps forced
the mixture to pass through two injectors located in the top part of
the reactor wall. This configuration generated dual opposite radial
jet flows in internozzle distance of 15 cm to produce a local zone
of high mass transfer with small size droplets of oil due to the col-
lision of oil jets at that space. They also examined four nozzle di-
ameters ranging from 5 to 13 mm and argued that nozzles size had
an inverse relationship with Reynolds number and reaction tem-
perature. More specifically, the highest initial Reynolds number of
6470 was delivered by nozzle diameter of 5 mm. This could be as-
cribed to the high temperature of the mixture in response to high
friction created which in turn lowered density and viscosity of the
mixture, and consequently led to flow increments [207] .

In a more recent study using JSR configuration, Ghasemi and
Molaei Dehkordi [287] used KOH/ γ -Al
3 millimetric particles for
accelerating the transesterification process of WCO. The millimet-
ric size catalyst eliminated some drawbacks associated with their
conventional smaller size counterpart, viz. , leaching of potassium
moiety into the solution, dropping of activity in recycled catalyst,
and separation difficulty. However, intense mixing was required to
overcome the external mass transfer resistance all over the solid
catalyst particles [287,301] . Therefore, they applied two-impinging-
jet technique in the JSR to deliver vigorous micromixing of reaction
mixture. The catalyst was located in the reaction chamber and a

the rotational speed which can in droplet, film, or pore flow forms
at low, medium, or high centrifugal forces, respectively [310] . The
process is completed by flowing the stream of liquid into the hous-
ing and leaving the reactor through outlets [309] .

RPBR efficiency depends on operational parameters, including
flow rate of liquid, speed of rotation, volumetric ratio of two liquid
streams, and fluid viscosity; as well as design parameters, includ-
ing packing (length, inner and outer radii, type, porosity), liquid
distributor (pipe, premixed, impinge), and liquid velocity charac-
teristics [308,309] . Rotational speed has a linear relationship with
segregation index, to some point, after which its influence is non-
linear [309] . Micromixing is facilitated at higher rotational speeds
by  providing  higher  energy  dissipation  [309] .  Similarly,  the  flow
rate  of  liquid  and  the  volumetric  ratio  of  two  supplied  liquid
streams  have  more  or  less  inverse  relationship  with  segregation
index.  In  contrast,  viscosity  has  a  proportional  relationship  with
segregation index and at higher viscosities, the average size of liq-
uid  fragments  increases  whereas  the  deformation  and  shrinkage
of liquid elements are reduced at a given energy dissipation rate
[309,311] .

The  application  of  RPBRs  for  the  transesterification  of  oils  is
still immature. It has been expressed that RPBRs can enhance the
transesterification  reaction  by  intensive  mixing  of  reactants  and
reagents within a short time [292,301] . More specifically, the mi-
cromixing  time  and  RTD  of  liquid  are  about  10 −4 s  and  within
several seconds [308, 312] . The subsequent centrifugation results
in glycerol phase separation and heterogeneous catalyst recovery
(in  the  case  of  its  application).  This  strategy  has  been  success-
fully  performed  for  continuous  production  of  biodiesel  from  ho-
mogeneous  or  heterogeneous-catalyzed  methanolysis  of  soybean
oil  [292,301] .  KOH  catalyzed-methylation  of  soybean  oil  (3 wt.%
KOH,  6:1  methanol-to-oil  molar  ratio,  60 °C)  was  conducted  un-
der continuous flow rates of methanol (69 mL/h) and oil (271 mL/h)
at  900 rpm  centrifugation.  Yield  and  productivity  of  97.3%  and
0.83 mol/min  were  achieved  with  43.2 s  residence  time,  respec-
tively [292] .

Spinning tube-in-tube reactors. STT reactor or inline high shear
mixer  is  another  reactor  with  tubular  geometry  which  was
patented  by  Richard  Holl  in  2010  [313] .  It  works  by  quickly  ro-
tating one tube inside another concentric fixed tube to generate
high shear micro-mixing. Major components of the system are ro-
tor (rotating cylinder), stator (stationary cylinder), two inlets, and
one  outlet.  Stator  encompasses  rotor  with  a  narrow  annual  gap
of 0.25–0.44 mm between them. Once reactants and reagents are
entered into this small annual space, the Couette flow and high
rate of shear induces instant mixing of the two liquids and their
subsequent  movement  as  a  coherent  thin  film  through  the  gap.
This  leads  to  a  very  large  interfacial  contact  area  which  in  turn
increases the reaction rate [314] . The enhanced rate of reaction re-
duces reaction time and energy consumption in the form of mix-
ing.  The  reactor  volume  and  centrifugal  force  are  typically  10–
10 0 0 mL and 30 0 0–12,0 0 0 rpm, respectively.

In the biodiesel production processes using STT reactors, two
separate streams of oil and methanol/catalyst are fed into the re-
actors  from  their  individual  inlets.  STT  fluid  flow  is  depicted  in
Fig.  16 .  Fluids  flow  through  the  slots  or  holes  around  the  rotor
and stator and pass through a gap between rotating and station-
ary parts of the reactor. High shear interaction of the two reactants
leads to elimination of mass transfer resistance and improves heat
transfer as well. It may be assumed that STT reactors may not be
an appropriate option for large-scale production of biodiesel due to
their low reaction volume. However, these reactors have been al-
ready utilized by COSTELLO Company for industrial scale biodiesel
production ( Fig. 17 ) [209] . The commercial version of STT system,
i.e., Cryon TM Reactor allows rapid scale-up as well as instant mix-
ing of alcohol and oil for trans/esterification reactions ( Fig. 18 ). This

ing  packing,  tears  and  shears  the  liquid  in  this  section.  Conse-
quently, smaller droplets and thinner liquid films are formed en-
hancing surface area, and hence, volumetric mass-transfer coeffi-
cients are surged 10–100 times [306] . The high gravitational force
(50 0–250 0 rpm) improves the speed of reaction, which is already
speeded up because of packed bed process.

RPBRs’ lower capital and space requirements as well as its pro-
cess  intensification  power  justify  its  higher  energy  consumption
for rotation. RPBR consists of a motor mounted either on the side
or underneath the reactor according to the rotation axis. It spins
a ring-shaped cylindrical packed bed rotor (moving part) with or
without a series of concentric perforated baffles placed in a cylin-
drical casing, i.e., housing (static part) ( Fig. 14 ). The center of ro-
tor is a hollow structure called as eye that distributes liquid. The
packing  bed  is  composed  of  three  sections,  viz.,  inner  rim  (im-
pingement zone), bulk zone, and outer rim. Both rims have a high
liquid hold-up whereas the bulk zone has a high liquid distribu-
tion and lower hold-up. The introduction of alcohol and oil into
the  rotating  packed  bed  can  be  performed  by  three  approaches
( Fig. 15 ), viz ., distribution pipes spraying droplets of alcohol and
oil separately, premixed distributor spraying droplets of previously
mixed alcohol and oil feed, or impinging stream distribution jet-
spraying alcohol against oil in the eye of the rotor [309] . The liquid
streams then sharply collide, i.e., impinge with the rotating packed
bed in its first 7–10 mm in length (also called the impingement
zone). Subsequently, the liquid is fed in the same direction as of
centrifugation  rotation  towards  the  outer  rim.  The  rate  of  pass-
ing the alcohol-oil mixture through the bulk zone is dependent on

flows  across  the  surface  of  spinning  disc  are  directly  controlled
by  rotational  speed,  which  forms  characteristic  finite-amplitude
waves  (concentric,  spiral)  and  sophisticated  interfacial  dynamics
[274,315] ( Fig. 20 ). An increase in the liquid flow rate and/or ro-
tational speed triggers radial velocity growth [316] . This excellent
fluid  dynamics  allows  a  continuous  and  efficient  production  of
chemicals using a compact SDR operating under appropriately high
rotational speeds. Moreover, SDR provides a great degree of control
on side-reactions, and hence, increases the process yield while re-
duces the cost of downstream purification. Both homogeneous re-
actions and heterogeneous catalysis ( i.e ., disc as the catalysis sup-
port) can be conveniently performed by SDRs [315] .

Wave formation in SDRs can be further intensified through the
application of a temporally and spatially varying electric field with
specific intensity and electrode geometry [318] . Further improve-
ment was done in a SDR variation known as rotor-stator spinning
disc reactor (RSSDR), consisting of three discs, i.e., one rotating disc
(rotor) and two stationary discs (stators) [319] . The rotor is placed
between the stators with an axial distance of 1 mm with a speed of
up to 4500 rpm. Later, another variation of SDR was also patented
[320] , consisting of two rotatable discs each with an input and an
output. The first rotatable disc was larger and contained a hollow
disc-shaped cavity where the second smaller rotatable disc with
channeled cavity was located. Both discs had an input and an out-
put and were concentric about an axis at a distance of 0.05 mm.
The  discs  were  counter-rotating  or  co-rotating  with  a  rotational
speed of up to 50 0 0 rpm to provide efficient multi-phase contact-
ing.

Studying disc radius and rotational speed of disc and volumet-
ric flow rate of liquid is important for scale-up process of SDRs
because they determine liquid film thickness as well as residence
time.  In  the  case  of  scaling-up  of  the  RSSDR,  it  is  important  to
increase  the  number  of  rotors-in-series  rather  than  the  diame-
ter  of  rotor.  This  is  because  increases  in  the  latter  would  result
in  a  significant  surge  in  energy  consumption  [274,321,322] .  Dur-

process can support rapid ( < 1 s) continuous process in a single re-
actor with single pass delivering minimal soap formation and high
conversion yield.

According to COSTELLO Company, the application of STT reac-
tor can increase the process yield up to 3% while providing higher
feedstock flexibility. The process requires about 33% lower capital
cost, no requirement for water wash step and hence save water
recovery costs, and occupy low space.

ing transesterification of oil using SDRs, the liquid feedstock is in-
troduced into the center of reactor chamber containing rotatable
disc.  Consequently,  a  liquid  film  with  thin,  unstable,  and  wavy
characteristics  is  distributed  across  the  disc.  The  movements  of
liquid  within  this  film  is  plug  flow  and  from  center  to  the  pe-
riphery [318,323] . A two-disk spinning reactor (one rotating and
one  stationary)  was  studied  by  Qiu  et  al.  [324]  for  continuous
NaOH-catalyzed  transesterification  of  canola  oil  (1 wt.%  catalyst,
6:1 methanol-to-oil molar ratio, 10 0 0 rpm, 30–50 °C, few seconds).
They observed a 20–40 folds shorter reaction time than BSTR un-
der similar conditions. They also argued that conversion was most
importantly influenced by sick surface morphology, rotation speed,
feed rate, and the intra-disk gap. Among them, the most influen-
tial parameter was found to be the intra-disk gap (optimum dis-
tance of 0.1 mm), which was inversely correlated with local shear

stresses, mixing intensity, and hence, the conversion. The optimum
gap  distance  led  to  55%  conversion  at  room  temperature.  Simi-
larly,  Wen  and  Petera  [325]  investigated  the  potential  of  a  two-
disc SDR for intensifying the biodiesel production process. The two
flat discs were concentric with a gap of 0.2 mm between upper ro-
tating disc and lower stationary disc. Methanol and triglycerides
was coaxially fed along the center line of stationary and rotating
discs. They noticed that despite the lower residence time, increas-
ing  the  rotational  speed  improved  the  conversion  process.  More
recently, Chen and Chen [317] applied a SDR for continuous soy-
based biodiesel synthesis (1.5 wt.% NaOH, 6:1 methanol-to-oil mo-
lar ratio, 773 mL/min flow rate, 60 °C, 2400 rpm, 2–3 s). Under such
optimum conditions, a yield of up to 97% was achieved with a pro-
duction rate of 1.86 mol/min. The findings of these studies high-
lighted the suitability of SDR and its intensification capability for

ric, composite) containing organic [ i.e., cellulose acetate, polyacry-
lonitrile,  poly(dimethylsiloxane),  polysulfone,  poly(vinylidene  di-
fluoride)], inorganic materials ( i.e., carbon, ceramic, α-Al
2 ,
ZnO
2 /C), or their hybrid ( i.e., organic-inorganic membranes) have
been  investigated  [ 328 , 332–338 ].  The  above-mentioned  conven-
tional  configurations  are  the  most  common  systems  for  mem-
brane housing and for preventing the negative impact of operating
pressure. Plate-and-frame membranes have a planar arrangement,
which is mainly in rectangular form providing a moderate aspects
ratio (surface-to-volume ratio). Some disadvantages of this config-
uration are possibility of plugging at flow stagnation points, diffi-
cult cleaning, and high cost [339] . While hollow fibers offer high
membrane aspect ratios and low energy utilization; however, they
are susceptible to plugging by particulates. In addition, the replace-
ment of the whole module is inevitable due to possible fouling of
fibers [340] .

Asymmetric  membranes  differ  from  their  composite  counter-
parts in the number of building materials. In another word, asym-
metric membranes are produced from a single material whereas
composite  membranes  include  at  least  two  structural  elements
produced from two different materials.

Various membranes have successfully been applied for the re-
tention  of  glycerol  (0.261–10 wt.%)  from  crude  biodiesel  with  or
without  the  presence  of  alcohol  and/or  oil.  After  passing  crude
biodiesel through these membranes, glycerol content in permeates
was reportedly dropped to about ∼0.01–0.19 wt.%, corresponding to
glycerol rejection percentages of more than 90–99.6 [ 328 , 341 , 342 ].
The  mechanisms  of  glycerol  retention  could  be  reversed  micelle
formation by glycerol or glycerol and soap molecules in microfil-
tration,  swelling  of  glycerol  droplet  by  adsorption  of  added  wa-
ter in ultrafiltration, or simply by sieving effect in nanofiltration
[ 328 , 334 , 341–343 ]. It should be noted that the amount of glycerol
in crude biodiesel plays a significant role in biodiesel quality on
the permeate side, possibly due to the action of trapped glycerol
as filter aid.

Inorganic membranes are more frequently studied for the sep-
aration and purification of biodiesel, compared with their organic
counterparts.  This  is  because  inorganic  membranes  are  chemi-
cally  inert  and  provide  unique  surface  characteristics  with  good
resistance  against  microbial  contamination  while  also  withstand
harsh  industrial  operation  conditions  such  as  high  temperature,
mechanical  stress,  and  organic  solvent  [ 340 , 343 ].  Despite  many
considerable  advantages  of  inorganic  membranes,  some  critical
disadvantages  of  these  membranes  including  brittleness,  compli-
cated sealing at high temperatures, difficult scale-up, low aspect
ratio, low selectivity (with few exceptions), and high capital and
maintenance  costs  hinder  their  industrial  application  [ 343 , 344 ].
Therefore,  the  application  of  organic  membranes  such  as  poly-
meric nanofiltration and reverse osmosis are recommended [343] .
It  should  be  noted  that  polymeric  membrane  materials  are  pH-
labile; and therefore, the pH of biodiesel must be reduced from
12.4 to below 8.7 to avoid physical damage to membrane structure
[ 338 , 343 ].

Saleh  et  al.  [334]  efficiently  reduced  the  glycerol  content  of
crude  biodiesel  from  0.04 wt.%  to  as  low  as  0.013 wt.%  (59–71%
glycerol rejection) using ultrafiltration membrane of polyacryloni-
trile, supported on frame-and-plate configuration. The ultrafiltra-
tion  was  conducted  with  molecular  cut-off of  100 kDa  at  pH  7,
25 °C,  0.55  MP  with  the  cross  flow  velocity  of  0.6 m/s.  Under
these optimum conditions, the membrane flux was 10 L/m 2 /h. The
permeate was taken whereas the retentate was recycled back to
the  feed  tank.  This  biodiesel  purification  process  required  slight
amounts of water for improvement of the two-phase system, and
hence,  very  low  amount  of  wastewater  (1 kg  water/500 L  of  the
treated  FAME)  was  generated  [334] .  It  is  worth  mentioning  that
the efficiency of separation is generally decreased with increased

simple and efficient synthesis of biodiesel in a small production
space.

3.2.3. Simultaneous reaction-separation reactors

This  group  of  reactors  combines  chemical  reactions  with  si-
multaneous  extraction  of  products  from  reactants  and  unreacted
reagents in a single unit operation, an intensification method also
known as reactive separation process. This intensification process
is  generally  used  for  equilibrium  reactions,  for  example,  trans-
esterification. The separation of product changes the equilibrium
of  the  reaction  in  favor  of  products  formation.  Moreover,  these
reactors  provide  excellent  mixing,  and  hence,  better  quality  and
higher yield of conversion are achieved. Two classes of reactors,
viz., membrane reactors and annular centrifugal contactors (ACCs),
and one technology, i.e., reactive distillation using simultaneous re-
action  and  separation  principle  for  biodiesel  production  are  dis-
cussed  in  this  section.  Other  types  of  reactive  separation  tech-
nologies, including reactive absorption and distillation, reactive ad-
sorption, reactive chromatography, and reactive extraction have not
been covered in this review due to space limitations.

3.2.3.1. Membrane  reactors.  Membranes  offer  a  selective  way  to
transport the target substances through them, which could be used
in  separation  of  liquids,  vapor,  and  gasses  with  different  mass
transfer rates [326] . The intensification of biofuel production pro-
cesses with membranes is becoming increasingly attractive [327] .
However,  the  application  of  membrane  separation  technology  in
biodiesel  production  process  is  relatively  a  new  concept  [328] .
It  can  be  applied  as  either  complementary  step  ( i.e.,  separation
and purification method) or integrated process ( i.e., simultaneous
reaction-separation reactor) in the transesterification process of oil
for biodiesel synthesis. In general, membranes are classified based
on their geometry, separation basis, and nature and are used for
enhancement of biodiesel quality to meet, for examples, DIN EN
14214 and/or ASTM D6761 standards for biodiesel with 100% pu-
rity. The selection of the right membrane type for a given process
depends  on  various  parameters  such  as  reaction  condition,  pro-
ductivity, separation method, lifetime, and the cost of membrane
[326] .

Separation  and  purification  of  biodiesel  via  membrane  tech-
nology  have  significant  advantages,  compared  with  conventional
methods.  This  ecofriendly  technology  produces  low  amounts  of
wastewater and utilizes low energy. Moreover, membrane can be
used as a mean for the treatment of wastewater generated during
separation and purification of biodiesel [329,330] . Membranes are
resistant to organic solvents and occupy a small area for their oper-
ation. In addition, membrane reactors could provide higher quality
biodiesel vs. conventional separators [331] . For the separation and
purification step, three configurations ( i.e., hollow fiber, plate-and-
frame,  tubular),  three  membrane  processes  ( i.e.,  microfiltration,
ultrafiltration,  nanofiltration),  and  two  structures  ( i.e.,  asymmet-

concentrations of methanol in this step due to increasing glycerol
solubility in FAME [334] .

Torres  et  al.  [338]  prepared polymeric  nanofiltration compos-
ite  membranes,  named  PVDF-12SI,  by  covering  the  surface  of
asymmetric membrane of poly(vinylidene difluoride) with 12 wt.%
poly(dimethylsiloxane)  solutions  in  hexane.  Interestingly,  PVDF-
12SI  could  tolerate  harsh  conditions  (pH  ∼12,  60 °C,  1.5 MPa)  of
ethyl ester purification with high stability permitting flux recovery
ratios of up to 0.95 after 20 cycles of use. Under these conditions,
PVDF-12SI rejected 70% of the glycerol and 69% of the total glyc-
eride with a membrane flux of 7.4 L/m 2 /h.

The  oily  nature  and  viscosity  of  crude  biodiesel  mask  the
good  selectivity  and  impurities  rejection  of  solvent  resistant
nanofiltration membranes by minimizing biodiesel permeation and
membrane  performance  efficiency  [337] .  Nevertheless,  the  flux
permeation may be increased by application of organic-inorganic
membranes  [ 337 , 345 ].  Such  type  of  void-free  membrane  is  gen-
erated by dispersion of inorganic particles into polymeric matrix.
Some examples of inorganic particles incorporated into polymeric
membranes to form organic-inorganic membranes are hydrotalcite,
multiwall carbon nanotubes, ZrO
2 [ 337 , 346 , 347 ]. In-
organic phase can be used as carrier of catalytic sites (in the case
of catalytic membrane in membrane reactors) and/or as support to
improve membranes characteristics. Other advantages of organic-
inorganic composite membranes are fouling resistance, and good
hydrophilicity and selectivity [337] . Peyravi et al. [337] added dif-
ferent concentrations of functionalized multiwall carbon nanotubes
in the polyimide casting solution for fabrication of nano-composite
solvent  resistant  membranes.  They  used  these  membranes  for
purification of laboratory synthesized canola-based biodiesel and
achieved up to 100% glycerol removal (pH 7, 25 °C, 0.5 MPa).

Transesterification  membrane  reactors  are  a  type  of  simulta-
neous reaction-separation intensification process in which the re-
action  is  integrated  with  in  situ  membrane  separation.  In  the
biodiesel production process, membrane system prevents passing
glycerol molecules or rejects the unreacted triglyceride molecules
from biodiesel stream [333] . Overall, compared with conventional
methods of biodiesel production, the application of membrane re-
actors provides lower operating cost because there is no need for
additional intermediate steps. Cao et al. [333] synthesized biodiesel
from  various  substrates  with  different  FFA  contents  via  continu-
ous membrane reactors. They obtained high yields of final prod-
uct with lower amount of glycerol in comparison with the conven-
tional batch techniques [ 348 , 349 ]. Some other examples of mem-
brane reactors applied for transesterification of oils have been pre-
sented in Table 12 .

Membrane reactors have two simultaneous functions, viz. pro-
ceeding  transesterification  reaction,  and  separation  of  undesired
compounds such as alcohol, catalysts, and glycerol from biodiesel
stream.  These  roles  can  be  fulfilled  through  three  most  pop-
ular  membrane  reactor  configurations  ( Fig.  21 ),  namely,  extrac-
tor  membrane-reactor,  distributor  membrane-reactor,  and  flow-
through membrane-reactor [ 354 , 355 ]. In the first configuration, the
yield of equilibrium-limited reactions is improved by selective re-
moval of the generated products by membrane so that the reaction
is shifted towards the products formation ( Fig. 21 A). The second
configuration selectively regulates the concentration of one reac-
tant/reagent that is required in successive reactions with the help
of membrane ( Fig. 21 B). Therefore, distributor membrane-reactor
minimizes the side reactions or further conversion of the desired
products. In the case of flow-through membrane-reactors, inert or
catalytic membranes could be used. In the former, the inert mem-
brane only acts as mixing system by forcing reactants and reagents
to flow through the membrane ( Fig. 21 C) while in the latter, which
is  the  most  common  configuration  used  for  biodiesel  synthesis
by alcoholysis reaction in membrane reactor, the catalytic mem-

brane participates in the reaction to generate biodiesel permeate
[ 352 , 356 ] ( Fig. 21 D). Technically, this configuration involves the im-
mobilization  of  desired  catalyst  on  or  into  a  suitable  membrane
(such as ceramic or polymeric membrane), which acts as micro-
structure catalyst carrier and may also perform separation task in
the case of integration of pervaporation technique (see further in-
formation at the end of this section) or hydrophilic polymeric ma-
trices  (glycerol,  methanol,  and  water  separation)  [ 351 , 356 ].  Me-
chanical  and  thermal  stability  of  these  membranes  can  be  im-
proved through cross-linking technique with appropriate amount
of a suitable compound. Cross-linking is also applied for the gen-
eration  of  catalytic  membrane  by  introducing  catalytically  active
site(s)  for  performing  reactions.  For  example,  the  application  of
cross-linking agents containing sulfonic groups, which also act as
active sites, produces more stable catalytic membrane for biodiesel
synthesis by alcoholysis of oil [356] .

As  mentioned  earlier,  membrane  reactors  can  also  be  classi-
fied based on the position of catalyst and membrane into (i) in-
ert  membrane  reactor  and  (ii)  catalytic  membrane  reactors.  The
catalyst  is  physically  separated  from  the  membrane  in  the  inert
membrane  reactors  and  the  membrane  ( e.g. ,  ceramic  membrane
with  a  microporous  structure,  carbon  membrane,  etc. )  does  not
directly participate in the reaction, but acts as a barrier to reac-
tant, reagents, and some products. In contrast, in the latter mem-
brane reactor  type,  either  the  catalyst  is  dispersed  in  the  mem-
brane or membrane itself acts as catalyst. Homogeneous catalysts,
glycerol, and biodiesel are soluble in methanol whereas the lipid

droplets  are  suspended  in  the  mixture.  Inert  membrane  reactor
prevents unreacted lipid to pass through it because the molecular
size of lipid molecules differs with soluble elements of the mixture
[ 333 , 348 ].

From simultaneous reaction-separation process, catalytic mem-
brane  reactors  are  better  choice  than  inert  membrane  reactors
[ 354 , 357 ].  Catalytic  membrane  performs  separation  and  conver-
sion through interaction between functional groups of membrane
and specific molecules in a mixture. Agarose, polypropylene, and
poly(vinyl  alcohol)  are  some  examples  of  membrane  that  have
been respectively applied as supports for catalytically active com-
pounds  including  Tungstophosphoric  acid  (H
2 SiO
3
and  N-[(2-hydroxy-3-trimethylammonium)  propyl]  chitosan  chlo-
ride,  and  acid  sulfosuccinic  for  biodiesel  production  via  transes-
terification of oil ( Table 12 ). In the transesterification process by
this  type  of  membrane,  methanol  and  glycerol  generate  bonds
with  OH  groups  of  the  membrane  and  are  eliminated  from  the
reaction  slurry  whereas  biodiesel  and  unreacted  lipids  are  re-
jected  by  the  membrane  due  to  their  different  chemical  struc-
tures  [ 334 , 350 ]. The suitability of  poly(vinyl alcohol) for  fabrica-
tion  of  catalytic  membranes  is  due  to  its  inherent  ability  to  be
functionalized  by  acidic  functional  groups  [350] .  Poly(vinyl  alco-
hol) and Nafion membranes were experimentally compared with
each  other  for  transesterification  of  soybean  oil.  According  to
the  results  obtained,  poly(vinyl  alcohol)  showed  better  charac-
teristics  as  a  basic  substance  for  catalytic  membrane  fabrication
[358] .

Membrane reactors, particularly organic synthetic hallow fiber
or plate-and-frame membranes, can act as good carriers of lipase
used in enzymatic transesterification. More specifically, lipase can
be immobilized on membrane to form catalytic membrane reactors
through adsorption, covalent binding, entrapment, microencapsu-
lation, or their combination thereof [359] . However, it should be
noted that the activity of enzyme could be reduced due to loss of
enzyme  during  immobilization  process  [360] .  Moreover,  reaction
processes  with  immobilized  enzymes  have  lower  mass-transfer,
compared  with  enzyme-free  reactions.  Despite  these  drawbacks,
improved  stability  of  immobilized  enzyme  leads  to  higher  eco-
nomic profitability of overall production process [360] .

Among the different enzyme immobilization techniques intro-
duced, adsorption is the most simple and cost-effective technique
[360] . In this method, lipase is adsorbed on the surface of mem-
brane through the weak linkages of hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic
interaction, ionic binding, and van der Waals interaction. However,
this method is also associated with some drawbacks including en-
zyme loading limitation and convenient desorption of enzyme by
aqueous solvent or even due to ionic strength, pH, and tempera-
ture of the reaction [ 359 , 360 ]. Covalent binding of lipase to various
organic and inorganic carriers is considered as the most advanta-
geous immobilization technique in terms of improved stability of
enzymes, high loading capacity, and minimized enzyme leaching
issue. Nevertheless, this method is time-consuming and often re-
quires harsh conditions such as toxic coupling reagents that may
inactivate enzyme [360] . Overall, very little is available in the pub-
lished literature on the use of enzymatic membrane reactors for
transesterifying oils.

Another technique known as pervaporation may also be cou-
pled with inert or catalytic membrane reactors to separate mix-
tures  of  liquid  by  partial  vaporization.  Separation  based  on  this
technique employs a non-porous dense membrane, composed from
zeolite or polymer [361] . In this method, separation occurs based
on  relative  rates  of  permeation  mediated  by  specific  membrane.
Pervaporation  separation  is  mostly  used  for  removal  of  organic
substances from an organic or aqueous mixture. The most distin-
guishable feature of pervaporation method is that both permeation
and  evaporation  occur  in  one  module.  The  main  mechanism  to

pass the substances is solution-diffusion, which is observed in non-
porous membranes [362] .

The  process  flow  diagram  of  a  typical  inert  membrane  reac-
tor  for  biodiesel  synthesis  by  transesterifying  oils  is  depicted  in
Fig.  22 .  This  configuration  normally  comprises  a  packed  or  flu-
idized bed of catalysts (in the case of heterogeneous catalyst) or
a feedstock/catalyst mixing chamber (in the case of homogeneous
catalyst).

The  critical  parameters  which  could  impact  membrane-based
biodiesel production include temperature, alcohol-to-oil molar ra-
tio, catalyst dosage, residence time, as well as membrane thickness
and  pore  size.  The  optimum  temperature  for  biodiesel  synthesis
via a membrane reactor is 50–70 °C depending on oil droplet size
[ 336 , 363 ]. Higher temperatures decreases FAME yield by compli-
cating the separation of alcohol and lipid phases due to increases
in the homogeneity of the system. It has been demonstrated that
elevation in methanol to-oil molar ratio enhance the process yield
in membrane reactor and the common methanol to-oil molar ratio
in a separation membrane reactor is 24:1 [ 333 , 336 ]. The separation
quality in a membrane reactor also depends on catalyst dosage. In-
creasing the catalyst loading can enhance the reaction conversion
through elimination of mass transfer limitation in a membrane re-
actor  [336] .  Otherwise,  more  residence  time  will  be  required  to
compensate for the low amount of catalyst. Another critical fac-
tor in membrane reactors is the membrane pore size, which is de-
termined with respect to the molecular size of the compounds of
the reaction mixture. In the transesterification reaction, oil droplets
have an average size of 12–1400 μm [333] . Therefore, the pore size
of  membrane  should  be  in  the  range  of  0.05–1.4 μm  to  prevent
passing of oil molecules to the permeate stream [333] . The stage
of a reaction is a main factor to determine the membrane thick-
ness. Accordingly, at the initiation of the process, the conversion
rate  increases  with  reducing  the  membrane  thickness.  However,
the  membrane  thickness  has  no  effect  on  the  reaction  rate  and
conversion at the end of process.

3.2.3.2. Reactive  distillation  reactors.  Traditionally,  in  reversible
liquid-phase reaction, the synthesis of products is induced accord-
ing to Le Chatlier’s principle through recovering of one or more
products in a separate process with the help of distillation [364] .
Thereafter, the unreacted reagents are recycled back into the re-
actor  for  further  conversion  into  products.  Alternatively,  surplus
amount of one reagent (such as alcohol) is added to the process
to obtain higher desired product yields (such as biodiesel) by bet-
ter  conversion  of  other  reagents  (such  as  oil)  at  the  expense  of
higher cost of distillation and recycling process. In contrast, this
goal can be achieved via continuous removal of the products al-
lowing neat operation of transesterification of oil, i.e., at the stoi-
chiometric molar methanol to-oil ratio of 3:1, pulling the equilib-
rium to efficient conversions. Although this conventional process
is effective for overcoming equilibrium limitations, it significantly
increases both capital and operating costs up to several times. Re-
active  distillation  ( Fig.  23 )  is  a  breakthrough  process  engineered
by merging chemical reaction and product separation ( i.e., distilla-
tion) in a reactive distillation column and could address the above-
mentioned challenges.

Technically, in reactive distillation, as the separation is induced
by thermal driving forces through distillation, the process is appli-
cable when there is a difference in chemicals’ boiling point or va-
por pressure [366] . In an ideal scenario, one product is the heaviest
and the other one is lightest with reactants as intermediate boiling
components [ 364 , 366 ]. The size of the reactive distillation column
can  be  greatly  lowered  by  a  deliberate  addition  of  an  appropri-
ate entrainer, which selectively reacts with one compound for its
simple removal from solution, or increasing the column pressure.
The process integrates enthalpy exchange, mass flow, multiple cat-

alyst systems, liquid and vapor traffic over the catalyst, and sep-
aration into one unit [364] . Reactive distillation has many socio-
economic and environmental advantages, including safer process,
lower capital (small and simple plant size) and operating costs (20-
time faster, maximum conversion, lower energy consumption, long
uninterrupted process), and lower emission, over conventional se-
quential processes.

From the operation point of view, a reactive zone is placed be-
tween a rectifying zone and a stripping zone [238] . The distillation
column may be packed or be built from a set of distinct stages
(trays). Typically, heavier reagents should be supplied at the top of
the reactive zone whereas the lighter reagents should be supplied
at the bottom of the reactive zone. In the case of biodiesel produc-
tion, the preheated alcohol and oil can be fed separately into the
reactive zone at different stage points or they can be mixed in a
pre-reactor to bring the system close to chemical equilibrium, and
then, the mixture of products, reagents, and reactants is fed to the
mentioned zone [238] .

In the case of heterogeneous catalyzed-transesterification, bas-
kets  or  screens  are  placed  between  trays  of  column  to  confine
the  catalyst  particles.  An  alternative  solution  would  be  the  ap-
plication of a packed bed prepared with standard catalyst shapes
such as rings and saddles. The countercurrent flow in small parti-

cles packed bed is intensified by integrating crimped wire meshes
into the design with catalyst held between their layers [238] . The
transesterification  reaction  proceeds  in  the  container  of  agitated
fluid  on  the  distillation  trays  while  aerating  with  alcohol  (com-
monly methanol) vapors produced in a re-boiler. Finally, the prod-
ucts, reagents, and reactants, leave the reactive zone and enter one
of the two distillation zones, either rectifying or stripping zones,
based on their volatility differences leading to their purification.
The rising methanol vapor, produced from unreacted methanol in
the re-boiler, takes part in the reaction while also contributing to
system agitation (through bubbling) and stripping water from the
reaction. This causes increasing concentrations of water and prod-
ucts (glycerol, FAME) towards the top (rectifying zone) and bottom
(stripping zone) of the distillation column, respectively ( Fig. 24 ). In
the rectifying zone, methanol and water are enriched, sent to con-
denser, and separated from each other with the help of decanter.
Water is removed from the system as distillate whereas methanol
is recycled back as a reflux and feeding stream. In the stripping
zone,  the  products,  i.e.,  biodiesel  and  glycerol  are  enriched,  fol-
lowed  by  their  heating  in  a  re-boiler  and  pumping  to  decanter
(settling tank). In the settling tank, biodiesel is separated from the
mixture and then methanol is separated from glycerol and other
impurities in a flash drum. Methanol is recycled back as vapor into

pared with a reactive distillation with upstream recycling because
of the lower total investment cost and energy requirement [307] .
However,  a  higher  production  cost  was  recorded  in  the  absence
of upstream recycle ( i.e. , alcohol recovery). Overall and based on
the  data  presented,  it  could  be  deduced  that  despite  the  higher
total production cost of biodiesel production using reactive distil-
lation without recycling upstream, this process would be the most
economical one in terms of return on investment and net present
value.

Noshadi  et  al.  [370]  continuously  converted  WCO  into
biodiesel  in  a  reactive  distillation  column  using  methanol  in
the  presence  of  catalyst  12-tungestophosphoric  acid  hexahydrate
2 O).  Under  optimum  conditions  (10 wt.%  catalyst,
(H
67.9:1  methanol  to-oil  molar  ratio,  116.2 mol/h  total  feed  flow,
1.3 kW re-boiler duty), a 94% biodiesel yield was achieved with re-
cycling the catalyst and pure methanol from the product stream
and condenser, respectively. This unacceptable large methanol to-
oil ratio about 70 may be ascribed to the shortcoming of this re-
search in considering the temperature of reactive distillation col-
umn.  In  better  words,  more  favorable  results  could  have  been
obtained  if  the  authors  had  considered  higher  temperature  val-
ues beyond the sub-optimal range considered, i.e. , 20–30 °C. More-
over, the total flow rate range considered in this study was 115–
150 mol/h  with  the  optimum  value  recorded  at  116.2 mol/h.  The
proximity of the optimum point to the minimum limit of the range
could be indicative of the weakness of the boiler duty in delivering
high heat energy to quickly raise the temperature of the column.
It is noteworthy that feed temperature as well as boiler duty must
be carefully assessed as they determine the process yield by di-
rectly influencing methanol availability, reaction rate, or biodiesel
degradation.

He et al. [205] designed a bench-scale reactive distillation sys-
tem containing 20 sieve-trays for continuous production of up to
75 mL/min  biodiesel  (90.7%  yield)  by  methanolysis  of  canola  oil
at 65 °C. The catalyst, i.e., KOCH
3 was introduced into the system
as a mixture (32 wt.%) in methanol feed stream of 11.64 mL/min.
The methanol-oil ratio was 4:1 and oil flow rate was 70 mL/min.
The  hold-up  of  about  5 min  makes  this  proposed  reactive  distil-
lation  reactor  up  to  12–36  times  faster  than  the  existing  indus-
trial batch reactor processes. In another study by Prasertsit et al.
[371] , a simple lab-scale reactive distillation packed column was
applied  for  KOH  catalyzed-methylation  of  palm  oil  (1 wt.%  KOH,
4.5:1 methanol-to-oil molar ratio, re-boiler temperature of 90 °C,
5 min hold-up in column). Up to 93% biodiesel was produced un-
der these conditions with a requirement for 25% less fresh feed
methanol than the conventional process.

3.2.3.3. Annular centrifugal contactors.  ACC, also known as centrifu-
gal  reactor/contactor,  has  been  developed  since  more  than  four
decades ago. Its prototype was designed at the Savannah River Lab-
oratory,  and  Argonne  National  Laboratory  modified  it  further  to
produce ACC. Monostage ACC uses single unit for mixing and sep-
aration of liquids by means of a vertical centrifuge. Multistage ACC
has several mechanical stages and is simply formed by intercon-
necting several monostage ACCs. The separation is performed due
to difference in the specific mass, i.e., density between liquids. The
process begins with feeding two immiscible liquids through two
separate inlets located close to the top of ACC into narrow annu-
lar spaces between the stationary housing wall and spinning ro-
tor. This gap defines the intensity of mixing, liquids volume hold-
up, and residence time [372] . In this region, liquids are mixed and
chemical reactions occur. Then, the fluid is directed through radial
stationary vanes in the housing base toward the rotor bottom, i.e.,
beginning of separation zone working by action of the spinning ro-
tor. The fluid rotation in a vortex manner is prevented by these
vanes. Subsequently, the mixed liquids are accelerated toward the

system. Glycerol can be deliberately purified in another distillation
column. If homogeneous catalyst is used, it is introduced at top of
column with water and methanol, which must be later decanted
from water and recycled back to the column [364] .

Reactive  distillation  is  an  active  field  of  study  for  many  sci-
entists, concentrating on the process control as well as operation
conditions,  i.e.,  agitation  intensity,  catalysts  loading  and  concen-
tration, condenser, re-boiler duties, feed inlets ratios, reflux ratios,
and temperature profiles.

The economic profitability of reactive distillation can be signif-
icantly  increased  by  improving  heat  exchange  efficiency  and  the
ability  of  the  system  to  maintain,  adsorb,  and  recycle  back  the
energy in the form of heat, for example, using thermal coupling
method. Such novel integrated process is suitable for a variety of
feedstock (palm fatty acid distillate, WCO, and animal tallow) and
is associated with reduced heating and cooling demands by 43%
and 47%, respectively [367] . Petchsoongsakul et al. [368] designed
a single reactive distillation column, packed with amberlyst-15 in
top and CaO/Al
3  in bottom as two heterogeneous catalysts, for
combined  esterification  and  transesterification  processes  to  con-
tinuously produce biodiesel from WCO. The column required four
esterification  and  20  transesterification  stages  when  operated  at
atmospheric pressure (0.1 MPa). They reduced the reactive stages
from 24 to 8 stages (three esterification stages, five transesterifica-
tion stages) by increasing the column pressure to 0.3 MPa. More-
over, the developed hybridization process required a net specific
energy of 216 kWh/kmol biodiesel, which was 8 and 449 kWh/kmol
biodiesel lower than that of two reactive distillation columns in se-
ries and conventional process, respectively.

Simasatitkul  and  Arpornwichanop  [369]  applied  the  reactive
distillation to convert from palm fatty acid distillate into biodiesel
and  improved  the  performance  of  both  reaction  and  separation
phases. Their simulation outcomes showed that a reactive distil-
lation system could discount not only production cost but also to-
tal investment cost in comparison with a conventional two–step
catalyzed system. In addition, they also concluded that a reactive
distillation without upstream recycling offered more benefits com-

wall as soon as they enter the separation zone with a speed cor-
responding to that of the rotor. The high-speed rotation facilitates
the phases separation by about 300 times, compared with grav-
ity conditions [372] . Moreover, it causes an upward movement of
fluid in the separation zone which extends from diverter disk to
the lighter phase weir [ 372–374 ]. This extended zone allows the
required transition time for the formation of a sharp liquid-liquid
interface, which in turn split off by flowing over their respective
weirs and exit through their respective outlets by gravity. At this
point, first mechanical stage is completed and each phase either
enters into next mechanical stage and so on (in the case of mul-
tistage ACC) or collector (in the case of monostage ACC). A suit-
able heavy phase weir ring, together with proper rotational speed,
is used for positioning the interface midway between the lighter
fluid  weir  and  the  heavier  fluid  undercurrent  at  the  uppermost
point of the separation zone [374] . This separation strategy is ro-
bust in response to slight changes in liquid ratios or flow rate as
the efficiency of separation is not reduced by considerable shift in
distance of interface position. In contrast, bulk flow rate, density,
and viscosity of two liquids with respect to reaction temperature
and  rotational  speed  must  be  considered  for  an  optimized  per-
formance. Moreover, it should be mentioned that Taylor number
which defines the significance of inertial forces (centrifugal forces)
depends  on  rotation  direction,  radius  ratio  of  the  cylinders,  and
column height.

The  main  challenge  in  ACC  is  their  uncontrollable  and  ex-
tremely low residence time (up to 10 s) that does not allow com-
plete  transesterification  reaction.  This  drawback  can  be  partially
addressed  by  using  additional  delay  loops  and  processing.  Alter-
natively,  Wardle  [372]  reported  that  an  improvement  in  mixing
zone residence time and generation of smaller droplet size could
be obtained through operating ACCs at less than half of its maxi-
mum capacity with a four straight vane design. This approach low-
ers the flow rates, and hence, increases hold-up volume as well
as overall performance in processes with kinetic limitation [310] .
Nu-Energie, LLC with cooperation of Oak Ridge National Laboratory
developed a novel ACC to increase the residence time to several
minutes  [375–377] .  For  this  purpose,  they  decreased  the  pump-
ing  rate  from  the  outer  chamber  to  inner  chamber  by  modify-
ing the inlet between the mixing and separation zones. Addition-
ally,  this  variation  of  ACC  could  provide  convenient  reagent  ad-
dition (methoxide/methanol), online sampling, and monitoring of
the  transesterification reaction  due  to  incorporation of  recircula-
tion and sampling zones into the design [ 375 , 376 ]. For batch pro-
duction of biodiesel by this modified ACC, two liquid phases, i.e.,
soybean oil and methanol including base catalyst were separately
supplied to the reactor. They were mixed and reacted with each
other  in  the  mixing  zone  (0.6 wt.%,  5.1:1  methanol-to-oil  molar
ratio, 0.26 MPa, 80 °C, 3600 rpm, 2 min) and then, the immiscible
products, i.e. , methyl esters and glycerol were recovered in the sep-
aration  zone  and  collected  by  their  respective  weirs.  It  was  re-
ported that after a single-pass, ASTM specifications for bound acyl-
glycerides were reached; higher quality biodiesel could be achieved
through the second and third passes of the biodiesel obtained in
the previous pass with minor addition of methanol [375] . More-
over, the yield could be increased to as high as 95% by a total of
10 min residence time, i.e. , five consecuti ve stages (5 × 2 min) with
addition of methanol only in first stage [ 375 , 376 ]. It was also re-
ported that at 60 °C and 4200 rpm and by increasing the pressure
of  system,  a  continuous  production  of  ASTM-passed  biodiesel  in
the ACC could be achieved with 1 min residence time [375] .

CINC Industries also designed a series of liquid-liquid ACC with
a capacity of 1.9–757 L/min ( Fig. 25 ). This series provides a good
environment for batch or continuous chemical processes and per-
forms  neutralization  and  separation  in  one-step  with  optimum
mass transfer to reduce solvent usage. The device is equipped with

tries [267] .

an internal clean-in-place system, allowing easy and quick cleaning
of the reactor with no need for disassembling.

The  performance  of  the  CINC  ACC,  particularly  CINC  V02,  for
continuous synthesis of biodiesel has been examined by some sci-
entists. For instance, Kraaj et al. [378] fed a CINC V02 with two
separate  feed  streams;  a  stream  of  sunflower  oil  and  a  solution
of sodium methoxide in methanol, with flow rates of 12.6 mL/min
and  3.1 mL/min,  respectively.  Under  optimum  conditions  (1 wt.%
CH
3 NaO, 6:1 methanol-to-oil molar ratio, 60 °C, 2400 rpm), a con-
tinuous  production  of  biodiesel  with  a  yield  of  96%  was  deliv-
ered. Similarly, Abduh et al. [379] achieved a biodiesel yield of 98
mol% with a volumetric production fatty acid ethyl ester (FAEE) of
112 kg/m 3
liquid /min  through  sodium  ethoxide  catalyzed-ethylation
of  J.  curcas  L.  oil  at  optimum  conditions  (1 wt.%  C
5 ONa,  6:1
ethanol-to-oil molar ratio, 60 °C, 2100 rpm, 28 mL/min oil flow rate,
10.3 mL/min  ethanol  flow  rate  containing  dissolved  C
5 ONa)  in
a CINC V02. In this study, the ACC provided a similar conversion
yield  corresponding  to  about  57%  less  than  standard  yield  that
obtained with optimized batch reactor. However, the process was
found suitable for small-scale mobilized biodiesel units with ap-
preciable robustness, size, and flexibility in production.

3.2.4. Cavitational reactors

Two types of energy, acoustic or flow energy, are used in cavi-
tational reactors to intensify chemical processes through the cavi-
tation phenomenon [380] . The other two types of energy, i.e., optic
or particle energy are not appropriate for induction of good chemi-
cal and physical intensification of reactions [380] . The formation of
cavities, their subsequent growth, and their collapse release huge
energies over a very small area leading to large energy densities,

276

which in turn efficiently improve the physical and chemical charac-
teristics of reaction [380] . In better words, as a result of the simul-
taneous incidents of cavitation (at ambient conditions) within the
reactor, local hot spots with over hundred mega Pascal pressure
and thousands Celsius temperature are formed. The cavitation also
facilitates the transport process (mixing intensity) through promo-
tion of micro-turbulent eddies, shock waves, and acoustic stream-
ing (liquid micro-circulation) [ 380–382 ]. Additionally, free radicals
responsible for chemical transformation are probably formed un-
der this condition. Maximum size and life of the cavity are the two
important characteristics of any cavitational reaction which respec-
tively determine the amount of pressure pulse upon collapse of the
cavity and active volume of the reactor [ 380 , 383 ]. Therefore, vari-
ous parameters must be optimized to increase these quantities for
maximum intensification of the process [380] . During the transes-
terification of oils, very fine emulsions are generated due to dis-
ruption and mixing caused by cavitational collapse near or at the
two liquids interface. Consequently, the surface area at which alco-
hol, catalyst, and oil interact with each other is increased, followed
by an increase in the reaction rate. The advantages of cavitation
as an emulsifying technique is the generation of smaller and more
stable emulsions than conventional techniques in the presence of
little to no surfactant, which is perfect for biphasic systems or PTC
technique.

3.2.4.1. Sonochemical/ultrasonic  reactors.  These  reactors  are  based
on acoustic cavitation which involves sonochemistry, i.e., enhanc-
ing chemical reaction due to modification in pressure through the
passage of sound waves. The most common sound waves are ul-
trasound  in  the  range  of  16 kHz  to  100 MHz  [380] .  Complete  si-
nusoidal waves including both expansion (positive pressure) and
constriction  (negative  pressure)  generate  sonoluminescence  bub-
bles  (vacuum  micro  regions  filled  with  reagent  vapors).  In  con-
trast  to  the  number  of  cavitation  bubbles,  the  size  of  cavitation
bubble,  and  hence,  energy  released  by  bubble  implosion  has  an
inverse relationship with the ultrasonic frequency. Cavitation oc-
curs as the formed bubbles expand and collapse [384] . With re-
spect to biofuel production, ultrasound-assisted technologies have
been proven to be beneficiary far beyond the scope of esterifica-
tion/transesterification reactions [385] . It is crucial to appropriately
select energy intensity in relation with average behavior of bub-
bles,  control  active  cavitation  population  (cavitational efficiency),
and provide uniform distribution of the ultrasonic activity for an
efficient utilization of ultrasonic energy as well as cavitational ef-
fects [ 380 , 385 ]. Every ultrasound-assisted reaction consists of three
main steps [386] . In the first step, electrical energy is converted
into mechanical energy by means of piezoelectric or piezomagnetic
transducers. Then, acoustic energy is transmitted from the emis-
sion tip to the medium in the second step, followed by energy con-
version to the final form leading to the chemical transformation in
the last step. Any energy loss during these three steps reduces the
overall process efficiency [386] .

Different  aspects  should  be  considered  while  designing
ultrasound-assisted  reactive  systems  including  angle,  depth
and position of probe with respect to geometry, size and working
capacity of reactor, quantity and output densities of transducers,
as  well  as  skin  morphology  and  shape  of  probe  [ 387–389 ].  For
example,  cavitational  blocking  phenomenon,  which  is  observed
when power densities near to the emission tip are very high, can
be  avoided  by  using  several  low-output  transducers.  Moreover,
in multi-transducer systems, lower erosion and particle shedding
is  observed  as  the  ultrasonic  intensity  is  concentrated  on  the
central  axis  and  away  from  the  vessel  walls  [380] .  Manickam
et  al.  [390]  compared  single,  dual,  and  triple  sonochemical  fre-
quencies  and  obtained  the  highest  yield  of  palm  oil  conversion
into  biodiesel  using  triple  frequency  operation  in  the  hexagonal

reactor design ( Fig. 26 ). They successfully decreased the reaction
time  to  15 min  with  a  yield  as  high  as  93%,  compared  with  a
3 h  conventional  stirring  process  with  a  biodiesel  yield  of  75%.
However,  further  improvements  in  yield  were  not  economically
feasible due to higher costs of downstream processes.

Ultrasonic  horn  reactors  are  the  most  common  sonochemical
reactor design [380] , which typically utilize an immersion type of
transducers to produce very high pressure intensities next to the
horn. The intensity is lowered exponentially by increasing the dis-
tance from horn depending on the operating frequency and power
input [391] . The efficiency of this sonochemical reactor design is
enhanced either by constraint of liquid within longitudinal high-
intensity  region  or  vigorous  mixing  of  liquid.  Two  variations  of
this design are sonochemical reactors with concentrator horn and
those with telsonic horn (with radial vibrations) [ 392 , 393 ]. Com-
plex scale up, erosion and particle shedding on the surface of emis-
sion tip, and cavitational blocking are among the main disadvan-
tages of this design and its variations.

Bhangu et al. [394] speeded up Candida rugosa -derived lipase-
catalyzed transesterification of canola oil from 22–24 h to 90 min
by applying a 3.5 cm ultrasonic horn (40 W, 20 kHz frequency). The
second common sonochemical design, i.e., ultrasonic bath (cleaner)
reactor consists of an ultrasonic bath encompassing the bottom of
the reactor. The irradiation of the working liquid is conducted by
single or multiple transducers. This configuration limits the active
zone to a vertical plane on top of the transducers with the high-
est intensity at the center of transducer [380] . Therefore, increasing
the bottom surface area of the reactor increases the irradiating sur-
face, and hence, improves the emission of sonochemical energy in
the reactor. Consequently, a higher pressure intensity is obtained
with lower ultrasonic intensity at the end of the cavitation pro-
cess [395] . Other configurations or sonochemical designs include
(i) tubular reactors with one transducer and one reflector at oppo-
site ends or one transducer at each end, (ii) transducers on each
side of a hexagon, and (iii) parallel plate reactors each irradiating
with different or same frequency [380] .

Sonochemical  reactors  result  in  better  transesterification  op-
eration  parameters,  including  lower  alcohol-to-oil  molar  ratios,
lower  catalyst  concentrations,  lower  temperatures,  shorter  resi-
dence times, than conventional processes [382] . For homogeneous
catalyzed-batch transesterification processes, the intensification is
mainly achieved by replacing magnetic or mechanical stirring de-
vices  with  ultrasonic  probes.  Feedstock  streams  of  catalyst  and
raw substances are generally mixed in an individual pretreatment
chamber. Ultrasonic irradiation step could be followed by different
downstream separation/purification scenarios. The process flow di-
agram of a typical of homogeneous ultrasound-assisted biodiesel
production system is represented in Fig. 27 .

Georgogianni et al. [396] compared different homogeneous and
heterogeneous  catalysts  during  ultrasound-assisted  synthesis  of
rapeseed biodiesel. Amongst Mg-MCM-41, Mg–Al hydrotalcite, K-
impregnated zirconia, and NaOH, the last catalyst led to the lowest
mass resistance and highest efficiency. Sequential ultrasound and
microwave irradiation was studied by Hsiao et al. [397] for con-
verting rapeseed oil into biodiesel in the presence of NaOH in a
step-wise process of 1 min ultrasound and 2 min microwave irra-
diation.  They  reported  that  the  method  quite  was  successful  for
biodiesel production due to lower energy requirements, lower op-
eration temperature, as well as elimination of mechanical stirring
and cooling systems.

Sáez et al. [398] emphasized on the significance of appropriate
fatty  acid  compositions  of  oil  feedstocks  for  batch  sonochemical
biodiesel  production  (20 kHz  frequency).  Accordingly,  shorter  hy-
drocarbon chains and higher saturation resulted in higher produc-
tion of FAME and lower glyceride concentrations vs. when longer
hydrocarbon chains and unsaturated fatty acids were used. They
also  emphasized  that  the  combination  of  three  ultrasound  am-
plitude  cycles  (generated  by  an  ultrasonic  probe  at  20 kHz  fre-
quency, 50% amplitude, and 70% duty cycle) with two 5-min ag-
itation intervals conducted at 900 rpm for 13 min and 48 s at 50 °C
was  an  efficient  method  for  transesterification  of  vegetable  oils
[352] . Recently, a high-frequency, energy-efficient piezoelectric ul-
trasonic reactor was introduced and analyzed from technical, en-
ergetic, exergetic, exergoeconomic, and exergoenvironmental view-
points  and  optimized  using  advanced  soft  computing  techniques
[ 11 , 132 , 399 , 400 ].

Table 13 presents more examples of sonochemical production
of biodiesel. Accordingly, it can be deduced that methanol, calcium
oxide, and potassium hydroxide are the most frequently used al-
cohol, heterogeneous catalyst, and homogeneous catalyst, respec-
tively. It is worth mentioning that alcohol molecular size and struc-
ture could have significant effect on the transesterification reaction
[283] . More specifically, as the number of carbons in alcohol struc-
ture increases, transfer of ester molecules formed in the glyceride
phase will be hindered more [283] . Additionally, primary straight
chain alcohols are the most suitable structure of alcohols among
primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols [ 401 , 402 ].

Arisdyne  System,  Inc.  has  developed  a  commercial  retrofit
biodiesel reactor, called controlled flow cavitation (CFC TM ) process,
based on sonochemical cavitation to form micro droplets and sub-
sequent  emulsion.  The  process  provides  a  tight  control  with  re-
peatable droplet size distribution, delivers lower amount of mono-
glycerides with no increase in catalyst concentration, and reduces
residence time and catalyst consumption (up to 25%) [413] . The ad-
vantages of this add on the reactor are efficient and rapid process,
simple installation, little pipefitting and small space requirements,
and low maintenance. Similarly, Hielscher Company supplies con-

tinuous biodiesel processing equipment based on ultrasound tech-
nology. In their technology, the oil is heated (45–65 °C) and con-
tinuously mixed with catalyst by adjustable pumps and an inline
static mixer. The mixture receives 5–30 s ultrasonic cavitation ex-
posures (up to 16 kW power, 20 kHz) by passing through the flow
cell. Then, it enters a reactor column for allowing the transester-
ification reaction to complete (60 min retention time). Finally, the
mixture is subjected to centrifugation to separate the biodiesel and
glycerol [413] .

3.2.4.2. Hydrodynamic cavitation reactors.  The second type of cavi-
tational reactors is hydrodynamic cavitation reactors, mainly con-
sisting of a pump and a constriction channel or interface, located
at the downstream of the pump’s discharge. Similar to sonochem-
ical reactors, these reactors also enhance the reaction rate through
cavity formations by pressure variations. These pressure variations,
unlike acoustic cavitation, are generated by using specific geome-
try of the system that causes velocity variation when a high flow
of fluid passes through the constriction channels/interface (orifice,
throttling valve, venture, etc. ) [414] . This passage elevates the ve-
locity of stream at the expense of its pressure. A permanent loss
in  pressure  is  resulted  because  of  the  generation  of  eddies  mo-
tion. Once pressure drops below the cavitation threshold pressure
(vapor pressure in the liquid at reaction temperature) millions of
cavities are produced [380] . As the stream proceeds, the pressure
recovers partially and the cavities collapse leading to an intense
local agitation [ 380 , 415 ]. The number of cavities can be modified
by opening the valve fully or partially. Moreover, flow rate can be
controlled with the help of a bypass [416] . Irreversible loss in pres-
sure head and friction as well as turbulence loss are the principal
factors affecting the cost of fluid pumping.

The  advantages  of  hydrodynamic  cavitation  reactors  are  their
simplicity  with  respect  to  design,  structure,  operation,  main-
tenance,  and  immediate  scale-up  [416] .  Moreover,  this  type  of
reactors provides a specific reaction or physical condition through
modification of pressure and temperature pulses. These pulses can
be adjusted by manipulation of bubble behavior through physical
and  geometrical  parameters,  for  examples,  discharge  pressure,
diameter ratio of constriction channel to pipe, and the dimensions
of the pipe located downstream of the constriction channel [416] .
In  contrast  to  linear  pressure  change  in  the  case  of  permanent
orifice, a rotating valve can be applied to exert a sinusoidal varying
pressure  field  on  bubbles  that  are  generated  at  the  shear  layer.
Additionally,  bubbles  with  more  violent  collapse  (large  pressure
and  temperature  pulses)  can  be  obtained  through  installation  of
two or three successive orifices to develop a fluctuating pressure
field at the shear layer [416] . Compared with acoustic cavitation,
hydrodynamic cavitation leads to lower erosion issues because the
cavitation takes place at the shear layer in bulk [416] . An intense

of micro-cavities and heat and/or mass transfer, a process known
as shockwaves. The cavitation is controlled and is away from the
metal surfaces to minimize the corrosion damage ( Fig. 29 B). Hydro
Dynamics, Inc. supplies SPRs in various models for biodiesel pro-
duction with annual input capacity ranging from 3–495 kton based
on continuous flow and 95% uptime [423] . Various feedstocks such
as beef tallow, poultry fat, and low-grade soybean oil can be uti-
lized and the process can be handled either in batch or continuous
mode. SPRs also have the advantages of the conventional hydrody-
namic cavitation reactors mentioned in the previous section.

3.2.5. Microwave reactors

Microwave  is  an  electromagnetic  base  irradiation  with  wave-
lengths  ranging  from  0.01  to  1 m  and  the  corresponding  fre-
quencies of 0.03 to 300 GHz [424] . The advantages of microwave
irradiation ( i.e., simple control, time and thermal efficiencies, clean
products, and less downstream processing) as well as microwave-
effect were partially explained under Section 2.3.1 . In spite of its
promising  features,  one  of  the  main  problems  associated  with
microwave  reactors  is  the  difficulty  of  controlling  power  and
temperature, and hence, low process reproducibility [ 425 , 426 ]. A
microwave reactor consists of a microwave source equipped with
a  power  supply  and  controls  (the  duty  cycle)  that  transfer  the
electromagnetic  energy  through  either  coaxial  cables  (for  lower
power) or waveguide (for higher power) into the chemical reactor,
enclosed  within  an  applicator  (a  metallic  cavity)  [ 426 , 427 ].  The
reactor vessel or tube can be constructed from various materials
such as polytetrafluoroethylene, polyether ether ketone, quartz, or
silicon carbide which are transparent or adsorptive of microwave
energy, allowing heating of reactants/reagents directly or indirectly,
respectively. In commercial microwave ovens, stirrers are used or
the reactor vessel is rotated to homogenize the electric field profile
[ 426 , 428 ]. These reactors are also equipped with online pressure
and  temperature  control  systems  and  have  a  specific  geometry
design  with  respect  to  the  penetration  depth.  All  commercial
microwave reactors support pressures and temperatures up to 3–
8 MPa and 250–300 °C, respectively [426] . Generally, the reaction
is completed within several minutes, although microwave reactors
have the ability to be operated for longer times (several hours).

Biodiesel  production  can  be  assisted  with  microwave  energy
through  two  main  routes,  including  oil  extraction  from  some
feedstocks  [ 429 , 430 ]  and  transesterification  reaction  of  oil  into
biodiesel. The second route has been discussed hereafter in which
microwave  irradiation  is  mainly  used  as  an  alternative  for  heat-
ing system (see also Section 2.3.2 ). Conventional heating, i.e., wall
heating and microwave heating have been illustrated in Fig. 30 .

The thermal energy is produced due to dipole reorientation (po-
larization) [432] . Under this condition, atomic or electronic polar-
ization, i.e., displacement of electrons around atoms or nuclei oc-
curs trillion times per second when polar molecules are exposed
to  microwave  irradiations.  Heat  is  generated  as  a  result  of  fric-
tion between rotating molecules. The other two mechanisms for
microwave heating are Maxwell-Wagner and conduction [ 432 , 433 ].
The  best  alcohol  as  acyl  acceptor  for  microwave-assisted
biodiesel production is methanol due to the presence of –OH group
providing polar characteristics as well as anchoring behavior [434] .
Consequently, more localized rotation of methanol molecules in-
duces more superheating capability. This allows more rapid reac-
tion with better performance and lower costs than other alcohols,
for example ethanol [435] . The sustainability of microwave-assisted
biodiesel  production  system  was  studied  through  comparison  of
the electrical energy demands of microwave generator and mixers
during biodiesel production with the electricity generated through
the combustion of the produced biodiesels [424] . Based on the re-
ported findings, the microwave-assisted biodiesel production gen-

turbulence and the subsequent uniform cavitation throughout the
reactor  allow  efficient  conduction  of  reactions  requiring  milder
conditions  of  pressure  and  temperature.  Interestingly,  hydrody-
namic  cavitation  requires  up  to  10  times  lower  energy  input
per  unit  of  reactant/reagent  volume  than  ultrasound  cavitation
[ 380 , 416 ]. Compared with conventional mixing processes, hydrody-
namic cavitation is a more cost-effective alternative as it reduces
the  energy  consumption  by  more  than  half  [417] .  Formation,
growth, and collapse of hydrodynamic cavities ( Fig. 28 ) release an
energy density equal to 1 × 10 18 kW/m 3 [418] .

Pal  et  al.  [417]  used  a  hydrodynamic  cavitation  system  con-
sisting  of  a  feed  tank,  a  pump,  an  orifice,  and  control  valves  to
produce biodiesel with Thumba ( Citrullus colocyntis ) oil. The pro-
cess achieved 80% yield within 30 min residence time. Same pro-
cess  approach  was  reported  by  Gole  et  al.  [419]  who  esterified
and  transesterified  non-edible  Nagchampa  oil.  In  the  transester-
ification  step,  20 min  treatment  of  pre-esterified  oil  with  1 wt.%
KOH and 6:1 alcohol-to-oil ratio yielded 92.1% biodiesel. Sunflower
oil was successfully transesterified into biodiesel (1% w/w NaOH,
6:1  methanol-to-oil  ratio,  ∼8450 rpm,  0.86 L/min  inlet  flow  rate,
3.5 min)  with  a  yield  of  88%  using  hydrodynamic  cavitation  re-
actor [420] . Bokhari et al. [421] also used a hydrodynamic cavi-
tation for cleaner synthesis of rubber seed ( Hevea brasiliensis ) oil
methyl ester. They synthesized FAME with 96.5% yield in 50 L pi-
lot hydrodynamic cavitation reactor consisting of orifice plate with
21 holes of 1 mm each and inlet pressure of 0.3 MPa (1 wt.% KOH,
6:1 alcohol-to-oil molar ratio, 55 °C, 18 min). Compared with me-
chanical stirring, hydrodynamic cavitation resulted in up to 4.9, 5,
and 6.5 times higher rate constant, less reaction time, and higher
energy efficiency, respectively [421] . It should be pointed out that
pressures beyond the optimum condition could lead to the chocked
cavitation phenomenon in which downstream is filled with a cav-
ity cloud resulting in liquid scape without collapsing, and conse-
quently reduced microturbulence and conversion [422] .

3.2.4.3. Shockwave power reactors.  SPRs ( Fig. 29 A) are in fact rotat-
ing hydrodynamic reactors that have a rotor with dead ended cav-
ities ( Fig. 29 C). Low pressure zones are created at the bottom of
the cavities due to rotor spinning [423] . Therefore, micro-cavities
are formed as the mixture of methanol and catalyst is fed into the
machine housing and passed through the specially designed rotor
[209] . The collapse of these low pressure zones leads to collapse

4. Environmental sustainability, economic viability, and
policy-making aspects of biodiesel

Scares et al. [436] obtained an ethyl ester yield of 84% by trans-
esterifying soybean oil in a continuous flow microwave reactor un-
der  optimum  conditions  (1 wt.%  NaOH,  9:1  ethanol-to-oil  molar
ratio, 42.5 L/h flow rate, 56.4 °C, 33 s, 10 0 0 W microwave power).
Panadare  and  Rathod  [437]  also  investigated  the  microwave-
assisted enzymatic (lipase 435) synthesis of biodiesel from WCO
and dimethyl carbonate. The reaction was completed in 4 h, result-
ing in a biodiesel yield of up to 94%. Milano et al. [158] successfully
transesterified a mixture of Calophyllum inophyllum and WCO (yield
of about 97%) using Anton Paar Monowave 400 high-performance
microwave reactor (0.77 wt.% KOH, 59.6 vol.% methanol-to-oil ratio,
60 0 rpm, 10 0 °C, 7.15 min). Thirugnanasambandham and Sivakumar
[438] also obtained a high conversion yield of 99.5% by transester-
ifying cotton seed oil in the presence of undetermined amount of
KOH (17:1 ethanol-to-oil molar ratio, 70 °C, 380 rpm, 12 min, 270 W
microwave power).

Microwave  irradiation  has  also  been  used  for  in  situ  transes-
terification of microalgae in combination with ultrasound or ionic
liquid (see Section 2.3.3 ) [172,439] . For instance, Ma et al. [439] di-
rectly transesterified Chlorella vulgaris microalgae in the presence
of  heterogeneous  KF/CaO  catalyst  in  a  ultrasound-microwave-
assisted process. A biodiesel yield of 93% was reached under the
optimum  conditions  (12 wt.%  catalyst,  8:1  methanol-to-oil  molar
ratio, 60 °C, 45 min).

4.1. Economic aspects and impacts of biodiesel production

The  total  investment  cost  for  any  biodiesel  production  plants
includes capital investment and operating costs. Briefly, the former
could  be  estimated  through  different  methods,  viz.,  class  1  ( i.e.,
detailed estimates), class 2 ( i.e., definitive estimates), class 3 ( i.e.,
preliminary estimates), class 4 ( i.e., study estimates), and class 5
( i.e., order-of-magnitude estimates) [ 4 40 , 4 41 ]. Of these, study esti-
mate is the most commonly applied approach for determination of
the cost of capital investment for biodiesel production [4 40–4 43] .
This  approach  is  useful  for  preliminary  feasibility  assessment  of
different  scenarios  [440]  with  respect  to  the  direct  plant  costs
( i.e., piping, instrumentation, electrical facilities, auxiliary facilities,
equipment  installation,  and  yard  improvement)  and  equipment
purchasing costs [441] . Therefore, the accuracy of this estimation
greatly relies on the precise design of the complete process flow,
selection  of  equipment  type  (their  construction  materials  and
size),  considering  their  most  updated  and  adjusted  prices,  and
execution of energy and material balances [ 4 40 , 4 41 , 4 4 4 ].

Total equipment costs  for  biodiesel production  have been es-
timated  by  different  researchers  [ 4 40 , 4 42 ].  For  instances,  Turton
R = 15,0 0 0 V .55  (V  is  volume)  for
et  al.  [440]  used  the  formula  C °
calculation of the fixed on board cost of each type of equipment
investigated in the design whereas Haas et al. [442] developed an

282

estimation method based on Chemcost Capital Cost and Profitabil-
ity Analysis Software as well as Cost Data Online ( i.e., Richardson
Construction Estimating Standards). In addition to the direct plant
costs and equipment purchasing costs, other criteria determining
the total investment cost include direct ( i.e., materials and labor
for installation) and indirect ( i.e., purchased taxes, insurance and
transportation, contractor fee, auxiliary facilities, and construction
overhead) expenses. Therefore, following the screening of the alter-
native processes by study estimates, the capital cost required for a
profitable process is estimated using preliminary estimates by in-
corporation of the mentioned criteria on the basis of percentage
allocation of the total equipment purchasing cost [ 4 40 , 4 41 ]. For in-
stances, a percentage allocation method has been used in Chilton
and Holland methods for estimating direct plant costs for biodiesel
production processes [445] .

Another cost associated with any biodiesel production plants is
the  operating  cost  which  includes  costs  of  repairs,  maintenance,
labor, utilities, and raw materials. Of these, raw materials ( e.g., al-
cohol,  oil,  catalyst,  wash  water,  etc. )  constitute  the  largest  frac-
tion of the operating cost [441] . The cost of raw materials for any
given plants could be estimated by knowing the capacity of the
biodiesel production plant and the final proportions of these ma-
terials  in  the  transesterification  reaction.  Moreover,  utilities  con-
sumption could be estimated according to the energy balance of
transesterification reaction and is dependent on size and type of
equipment and the applied process [ 4 41 , 4 46 ]. As mentioned ear-
lier, the current high cost of biodiesel is mainly due to the high
cost of feedstock, which may hinder its large-scale production as
well.  As  an  example,  the  cost  of  feedstock  for  small  and  large
scale biodiesel production plants contributed up to 75% and 90% of
the total production cost, respectively [ 4 40 , 4 41 ]. In another study
[442] , soy feedstock cost amounted approximately to 88% of the
total biodiesel production expenses scored. Typically, annual oper-
ating cost of a biodiesel plant is the sum of the costs of raw (i)
material, (ii) utilities, (iii) miscellaneous materials (1% fixed capi-
tal investment, FCI), (iv) maintenance (10% FCI), (v) operating la-
bor (manning estimates), (vi) labor (20% of operating labor), (vii)
supervision (20% of operating labor), (viii) overheads (50% of op-
erating labor), (ix) capital charges (15% FCI), and (x) insurance and
taxes (4% FCI) [ 4 40 , 4 41 ]. The sum of items i-iii stands for variable
cost, while the sum of items iv-x indicates fixed cost. The sum of
these two costs ( i.e., variable and fixed costs) determines the di-
rect production cost which is equal to annual production cost in
biodiesel production plant without R&D. If R&D is considered, the
annual production cost is increased by 5%. By dividing annual pro-
duction cost by plant capacity, unit production cost is determined
[ 4 40 , 4 41 ].

Overall, different technologies require different equipment and
may consume different raw materials; therefore, result in different
total cost of investment for biodiesel production. Nevertheless, the
operational biodiesel production systems around the world cannot
deliver a cost-competitive diesel fuel with the current technologies
and feedstocks. Therefore, the present manufacturers of biodiesel
have been incentivized by offering government supports ranging
from  subsidies  and  tax  exemption  to  mandatory  application  of
biodiesel as diesel extender and imposing taxes on petrodiesel. It is
obvious that the proper production and consumption of biodiesel
have obvious environmental benefits ( i.e., GHG emission reduction)
and possible positive economic impacts ( i.e., job creation) on coun-
tries. For example, National Biodiesel Board [447] analyzed the US
economy in 2013 with respect to biodiesel production (6435.2 mil-
lion  L).  Accordingly,  this  production  had  an  economic  impact  of
$16.8 billion, supported about 62 thousand jobs, and paid $2.6 bil-
lion wages. In the same study [447] , it was reported that produc-
tion and consumption of 4277.5 million L of biodiesel could ap-
proximately abate 10 million metric tons of CO

2-eq in the US.

It is worth to mention that the extension of biofuels (such as
biodiesel)  industry  has  indirect  and  direct  economic  impacts  on
the related markets such as energy, forestry, and agriculture [ 448–
451 ].  For  example,  as  a  result  of  land-use  change,  over-zealous
biodiesel production may have noticeable economic consequences
on  the  prices  of  forest  products,  land  values,  agricultural  com-
modities, fossil fuel energy, and food and feedstuffs [448] . Even-
tually, commercial production of biodiesel may economically influ-
ence country spending resulted from any biofuel competitiveness
policy. The increase in government expenditures and decrease in
its revenue may also negatively affect national development pro-
grams.

4.2. Biodiesel policies and mandates

As mentioned earlier, the current higher price of biodiesel com-
pared with fossil-based diesel substantially impedes its widespread
production and application by private sectors. More specifically, an
individual might be a staunch supporter of biodiesel but they are
not  willing  to  pay  a  cent  more  for  a  liter  of  biodiesel.  Regard-
less of price, the place of biodiesel as a fuel could negatively be
under vigorous political pressure by oil-rich countries or oil com-
panies. In another word, every liter of biodiesel sold is a liter of
petrodiesel  that  is  not  ( i.e.,  the  product  of  an  oil  company).  On
this basis, the biodiesel industry could not stand alone without a
strong policy supporting it. It should be noted that a single pol-
icy on biodiesel industry could not be applied worldwide as ef-
ficiency and success of any legislated policy depends on various
socio-economic  criteria  ( e.g.,  the  energy  state  of  country,  popu-
lation, economics, public acceptance, unemployment rate, etc., ) of
the destination country. For example, the success of Brazilian bio-
fuel policy could not be replicated in India owning to the frequent
failures of monsoon and seasonal variations [452] . Therefore, Na-
tional Biodiesel Mission was launched by government of India in
2003 based on the Committee on Development of Biofuel’s report.
The  goal  was  the  exploitation  of  13.4  million  ha  wastelands  for
Jatropha -based biodiesel in two phases including experimentation
and demonstration, and Jatropha cultivation, biodiesel production
and marketing [452] . In 2006, the government mandated oil mar-
keting companies for buying standard biodiesel at Rs. 26.5 (0.38
USD/L), including all taxes, in specific centers [452] . Despite these
effort s, the National Biodiesel Mission put an end and up to this
date, noticeable commercial production of biodiesel in India was
unsuccessful [452] . These were due to unscientific cultivation and
maintenance  of  Jatropha  oil  feedstock  and  lack  of  trust  between
industry  players  and  farmers.  Nevertheless,  the  main  constraint
was the price of biodiesel production which was 20–50% higher
than the purchase price determined in the biodiesel purchase pol-
icy [452] . Consequently, National Policy on Biofuels was adopted
by the government of India. According to its 2018 approved policy
[453] , the biofuel feedstocks were further expanded and farmers
were allowed (with National Biofuel Coordination Committee’s ap-
proval) to sell food feedstocks during the surplus production phase
to biofuel companies. The policy supported the foundation of sup-
ply chain mechanisms for production of biodiesel from WCO, non-
edible oilseeds, and short duration crops. Eventually, synergistic ef-
forts were encouraged by defining responsibilities and roles of each
department  or  ministry  involved  with  respect  to  biofuels  [453] .
The  expected  outcome  from  such  policy  would  be  cleaner  envi-
ronment, health benefits, infrastructural investment in rural areas,
employment rate improvement, increase in farmers’ income, and
decreased dependency on energy import [453] .

On  the  other  hand,  the  main  justifications  of  the  European
Union for development and coordination of a mandatory biofuels
policy at continental level have been environmental criteria ( e.g., at
2 abatement by 2020, compared with 1990) and fuel
least 20% CO

security [454] . The Directive on the promotion of the use of biofu-
els or other renewable fuels for transport was introduced in 2003,
setting 2 and 5.75% of biofuel shares in transport fuel by 2005 and
2010,  respectively  [454] .  In  the  same  year,  Member  States  were
allowed for biofuels tax reductions and exemptions under certain
conditions defined by the Energy Taxation Directive. Despite some
success, the share of biofuel stood at 1.4% in 2005, 0.6% lower than
the set point [ 454 , 455 ]. Therefore, “A European Union strategy for
biofuels” was released by the European Commission in 2006 to fa-
cilitate biofuels developments by setting out seven strategic policy
areas. This communication included “support to developing coun-
tries”; “research and development”; and “discussing the opportuni-
ties and biofuel demand improvements” [454] . In 2007, the Europe
Union endorsed the “Renewable Energy Roadmap” for turning the
Europe into a low-carbon and highly energy-efficient economy by
increasing the share of renewable and sustainable energies up to
20% by 2020. In line with this, the minimum share of biofuels for
phasing out diesel and petrol in the transport sector was targeted
at 10% [454] . The endorsement was further supported with some
legal  measurements,  i.e.,  Climate  and  Energy  Packages  legislated
and adopted in 2008 and 2009, respectively [456] . However, dif-
ferent stakeholders and Member States weakened the position of
liquid biofuels in the transport sector in the original proposal dur-
ing negotiations for legislation by stating that renewable resources
( i.e., bioelectricity, biohydrogen, biodiesel, etc. ) must source 10% of
the energy ( i.e., not only diesel and petrol) in the transport sector
[454] .

Recently, the energy and climate objectives for 2030 set in 2018
increased the share of renewable energies up to 32% of total energy
consumption in all sectors with a minimum GHG emission reduc-
tion targeted at 40% [ 457 , 458 ]. More specifically, the exchange of
the total transportation energy by renewable ones were agreed to
be 14% with 3.5% share of advanced biofuels (such as WCO and/or
animal fats derived biodiesel) [458] . It should be noted that in both
2020 and 2030 Renewable Energy Directives (REDs), the WCO and
animal  fats  derived  biofuels  could  count  double  towards  the  re-
spective targets of 10% and 14% renewable energy sources. Marine
and aviation sectors were exempted from these mandates; how-
ever, the application of each unit of biofuel in these sectors could
be counted at 1.2 times of other transportation sector [458] .

The encouraging mechanisms for biofuels production and con-
sumption range from total or partial tax exemptions (or fossil fuels
taxation) for making the price of biofuels lower than fossil fuels to
force blending of biofuels. The latter mechanism was adopted by
many European countries to avoid revenue losses by governments
in expense of transport users [ 454 , 459 ]. An alternative mechanism
was  established  by  Fuel  Quality  Directives  in  which  State  Mem-
bers were ordered to reduce their fossil fuel lifecycle emissions up
to 6% of 2010 by 2020 while at the same time allowed the ap-
plication of greater amounts of biofuels as petrol and diesel ex-
tenders. This mandate could motivate fuel suppliers for consuming
more biofuels in their products as blends to decrease GHG emis-
sions level [ 454 , 460 ]. The European Union farmers were also mo-
tivated  by  Common  Agricultural  Policy  to  grow  energy  crops  by
providing 45 €/ha subsidy (under Energy Crop Scheme) and by al-
lowing the cultivation of these crops on set-aside lands (constitut-
ing 10% of a farmer land under European Union agricultural law),
that were terminated in 2008 and 2010, respectively [454] . In 2015,
the European Union Indirect LUC Directive made an amendment to
RED transport target for encouraging the non-food-based-biofuels
by capping the contribution of conventional feed- and food-based
biofuels at 7% [458,461] .

In 2008, Germany (2,477,983 toe), France (2,020,690 toe), and
United  Kingdom  (691,335  toe)  were  the  top  three  highest  con-
sumers of biodiesel in the European Union [462] . Germany, for ex-
ample,  has  mandated  the  application  of  biofuel  in  rail  and  road

transport  since  2009  with  a  biofuel  target  of  6.25%  [ 16 , 458 ].  In
2016, the contribution of biofuels to the transportation sector in
Germany was up to 4.7% (with double counting) out of the 6.9%
share of the renewable energies [458] . The two most widely ap-
plied biofuels were biodiesel and ethanol with 59% and 35% of all
the biofuels consumed, respectively [458] . Germany plans to de-
crease  its  GHG  emissions  from  fossil  fuels  in  the  transport  sec-
tor up to 6% in 2020 and to maintain it at that level for 5 years
( i.e., until 2025) by blending the required amounts of biofuels (not
from animal fats and oil) with no double-counting criteria [458] .
Nevertheless,  the  application  of  conventional  biofuels  capped  at
6.5% and the mandatory application of advanced biofuel will be in
place in 2020 and will reach up to 0.5% in 2025. This plan clearly
shows  Germany‘s  agenda  shifting  from  an  energy  mandate  to  a
GHG abatement since 2015. Parallel to this, the 1.55 €/L and 0.7
€/L penalties of diesel equivalent for violating fuel suppliers until
2014 were replaced by 470 €/tCO

2-eq of GHG not saved [458] .

Overall, regardless of the scope, the success of any sustainable
biofuel  policy  program  substantially  depends  on  the  strict  legal
obligations and effective implementation. Nevertheless, a support-
ive agricultural policy is also needed to improve the biofuel feed-
stock amount and cost.

4.3. Biodiesel tradeoffs and feedstock sustainability

Despite the substantial advantages of biodiesel, some negative
impacts are also associated with its application including (i) net
GHGs from direct or indirect land-use change (LUC), (ii) impacts
on tropical forests and biodiversity, (iii) threat to food security and
food price ( i.e., food vs. fuel debate), and (iv) competition for wa-
ter resources ( i.e., drink vs. drive debate) [463] . Theses tradeoffs of
biodiesel production/utilization can be at least minimized, if not
eliminated, through observing sustainability criteria encompassing
careful selection/evaluation of feedstock/technology used for sus-
tainable biodiesel production as well as by the implementation of
appropriate policies.

Among  such  criteria,  those  related  to  feedstock  are  of  out-
most  importance  given  the  fact  that  the  majority  of  the  above-
mentioned  disadvantages  of  biodiesel  are  attributed  to  this
domain. Feedstock evaluations must be multi-criteria based con-
sidering  the  geographical  as  well  as  societal  features  of  a  given
territory.  Moreover,  such  evaluations  should  take  into  account
carbon  footprint,  water  footprint,  impact  on  food/water  security,
economic  feasibility  (both  cultivation  and  conversion  processes),
and quality attributes of respective biodiesel ( i.e., cloud point, flash
point,  pour  point,  calorific  value,  cetane  number,  etc. ).  It  is  also
critical to consider highly diverse biodiesel feedstocks to prevent
dependency  on  certain  resources  both  regionally  and  globally
[464] . In line with that, different oil feedstocks used for biodiesel
production have been investigated with respect to oil yield as well
as  carbon  and  water  footprints  ( Table  14 )  and  the  properties  of
the resultant fuels ( Table 15 ).

4.3.1. Edible and non-edible oil crops

Further increases of the global biodiesel production capacity ei-
ther requires more exploitation of non-agricultural lands such as
forests for growing more biodiesel feedstock crops ( i.e. , direct LUC)
or increasing the diversion of already cultivated feed or food crops
towards biodiesel industry ( i.e., indirect LUC). LUC could in general
contribute to altered GHG emissions due to the following modifica-
tions in; the aboveground and underground biomass, the emission
of N
2 O from soil, and the soil carbon stocks [544] . These modifica-
tions may render biodiesel production not sustainable with respect
to emission reduction of GHGs and carbon payback. For example,
the conversion of peatland or natural rain forest for oil palm cul-
tivation requires 320 or 57 years carbon payback by palm-based

biodiesel, respectively [545] . While only eight years of palm-based
biodiesel production could mitigate the carbon debt in the form of
GHG emission from LUC of the logged-over forest [545] . It should
be noted that the reduction of vegetation of managed and natural
ecosystems as well as the organic carbon storehouses in the soils
must be minimized in order to achieve a sustainable production
of biodiesel in terms of GHGs mitigation. On the same basis, it is
recommended to grow native perennial crops in abandoned agri-
cultural or degraded lands for biodiesel production [546] .

Microalgae have also been promoted as promising triglyceride
source for sustainable biodiesel production, if their limitations to
commercialization  would  be  overcome.  For  instance,  cheap  con-
2 supply point together with other essential resources
centrated CO
such  as  fertilizers  are  necessary  for  efficient  cultivation  of  mi-
croalgae [27,547] . On this basis, nitrogen and phosphorous nutri-
ents must be totally recycled back and ideally the system ability
for nitrogen bio-fixation should be granted. Another constraint on
the way of large-scale algal biodiesel is freshwater and its limited
supply considerably reducing the yield of production [547] . These
constraints make the near-future commercial application of algal
biodiesel  almost  impossible.  Therefore,  in  this  section  the  main
focus  is  placed  on  other  viable  feedstocks  for  biodiesel  produc-
tion,  i.e.,  animal  fats  and  vegetable  oils.  The  carbon  footprint  of
any  crop-based  biodiesel  could  be  estimated  through  an  analy-
sis known as life cycle assessment (LCA), involving all the stages
from the production of a given feedstock to the combustion of its
respective biodiesel and could be further completed by consider-
ing  LUC  [ 466 , 548 , 549 ].  LCA  is  in  fact  directly  related  to  agricul-
tural practice efficiency (field practices, yield, transportation, etc. )
[550] as well as biodiesel production efficiency. It should be noted
that  in  general,  biodiesel  combustion  emits  roughly  equal  GHG
emissions to what fixed during the growth of its respective feed-
stock (biomass). However, the utilization of fossil fuels in various
stages of crop cultivation and/or biodiesel production could lead
to a final carbon debt. According to the European Union’s policies
and regulations, i.e. , RED, LCA of biodiesel from any given feedstock
must  confirm  a  minimal  GHG-emissions  reduction  of  35%,  com-
pared with GHG emissions arisen from the synthesis and applica-
tion of conventional fuels, to be considered as sustainable [551] .

2  is  emitted  in  the  form  of  N

Four major biodiesel feedstocks include palm oil, rapeseed, soy-
bean, and sunflower seed. Of these, rapeseed biodiesel is the most
extensively  used  biodiesel;  however,  this  crop  is  currently  culti-
vated using an intense application of nitrogen-containing fertilizer.
2 O
Up  to  3–5%  of  the  provided  N
with a 296-time stronger global warming potential than CO
2 [552] .
In  contrast,  soybean  cultivation  does  not  require  any  nitrogen-
containing fertilizers, and hence, its cultivation is more favorable
than rapeseed in terms of economic and GHGs emissions. The cul-
tivations of palm and soybean are mostly concentrated in biodiver-
sity hotspots [553] ; therefore, any further expansions in their pro-
duction may further jeopardize tropical forests and consequently
threaten their associated native biodiversity [463] . Cerrado and the
Amazon (in the case of soybean) in South America, and Indone-
sia’s and Malaysia’s rainforests (in the case of palm) in Southeast
Asia are at the highest risk of the above-mentioned destructions
[ 544 , 554 ].

On the other hand, a popular debate allegory, i.e., food vs. fuel
has  also  been  raised  due  to  increasing  food  prices  in  this  mil-
lennium. More specifically, biodiesel production may decrease the
availability of foods by either direct absorption of food/feed feed-
stocks and/or reducing the production of food/feed crops due to
indirect LUC as well as soil depletion. In addition, increasing water
demands for agricultural expansions as well as population growth
have already raised severe water crisis worldwide [463] . As men-
tioned earlier, biodiesel production plants generate up to 1.2 L of
wastewater per each liter of purified biodiesel during wet wash-

ing process. Although, this water consumption can be minimized
( ∼20 mL/each liter of biodiesel) through adopting various advanced
technologies,  biodiesel  production  still  require  huge  amounts  of
water for the cultivation of oil feedstocks. The latter water con-
sumption  has  raised  drink  vs.  drive  arguments  and  is  partially
blamed for water crisis severity.

The water footprint of any crops can be calculated by consider-
ing their consumption of blue, green, and gray virtual-water [470] .
The  blue  virtual-water  content  represent  the  amount  of  evapo-
rated rainwater while the green virtual-water content stands for
the amount of ground and surface water consumed during the cul-
tivation process [470] . They all directly depend on irrigational, ge-
ographical, and climatic variables. The gray virtual-water of a crop
refers to the amount of polluted water generated during the crop
cultivation and is mainly related to agricultural practices [470] . In
general, some oilseed crops yield appropriately under rain-fed con-
ditions and require limited irrigation facilities at the critical growth
points, i.e., sowing, flowering, and seeding [555] . Such crops if in-
digenous to arid or semi-arid areas or genetically-modified to be
so could serve as sustainable biodiesel feedstocks with respect to
water footprint.

Table  14  presents  the  data  on  global  average  water  footprint
(blue and green) of some oil feedstocks used for biodiesel produc-
tion [470] . It should be noted that the water footprints of these
crops  may  vary  in  different  parts  of  the  world  as  evapotranspi-
ration  of  crops  could  be  affected  by  climatic  conditions.  For  ex-
ample, soybean consumes 602 m 3 /ton (61 m 3 /GJ) water in Brazil
but its water consumption increases to 979 m 3 /ton (99 m 3 /GJ) and
1360  m 3 /ton  (138  m 3 /GJ)  under  the  climatic  conditions  present
in the United States and Zimbabwe, respectively [556] . Therefore,
the  Brazilian  priorities  for  biodiesel  feedstocks  (based  on  water
footprint) would be coconut, 4 4 4 m 3 /ton (49 m 3 /GJ); groundnuts,
426  m 3 /ton  (51  m 3 /GJ);  sunflower,  972  m 3 /ton  (54  m 3 /GJ);  soy-
bean, 602 m 3 /ton (61 m 3 /GJ), palm oil, 1502 m 3 /ton (75 m 3 /GJ),
and rapeseed, 1460 m 3 /ton (214 m 3 /GJ) [556] . While based on the
data  provided  by  Berger  et  al.  [557]  on  blue  virtual-water  foot-
print  of  some  crops,  the  European  priorities  for  biodiesel  feed-
stocks would be rapeseed, soybean, and sunflower consuming 41.8,
302.3, and 426.2 million m 3 water for the production of about 6.17,
2.88, and 0.58 million L of biodiesel (each 31 L of biodiesel is equal
to 1 GJ), respectively. Based on these results, it could be concluded
that the application of irrigated sunflower for biodiesel synthesis
is a total waste of water, particularly in Spain where 275.2 million
m 3 water is used for the production of only 0.9% of the total Eu-
ropean feedstock required for synthesis of 250.3 × 10 5 GJ biodiesel
[557] .

Overall, edible oils, despite their low FFA contents ( i.e ., no es-
terification pretreatment requirement), could not be used for sus-
tainable biodiesel production even if economically feasible, due to
violently triggering food/water vs. fuel debates and threating bio-
diversity in some cases as well. Therefore, non-edible oils are ar-
guably more agronomically-justified ( i.e. , lower water, soil, fertil-
izer,  pesticide  requirements)  and  more  environmentally-efficient
( i.e., less LUC, more CO
2 sequestration) feedstocks than edible ones
as long as they  are cultivated  on marginal and waste lands, i.e.,
lands that are poor for other crops [ 464 , 558–560 ]. A good exam-
ple could be jatropha plant (life-cycle of 30–50 years) which effi-
ciently grows and yields oil seeds (after 2–3 years) even in sandy
and saline soils with 250 mm annual precipitations [506] . Castor
shares similar ecological requirements with jatropha and could be
intercropped  with  it  to  compensate  for  the  low  income  of  jat-
ropha cultivation in its initial 2–3 years of plantation [506] . Cas-
tor biodiesel has one of the lowest cloud point ( −12 to −27.8) and
pour point ( −32 to −45) amongst all the biodiesel produced ever
( Table  15 ).  Rubber  plant  is  another  non-edible  oil  seed  produc-
ing tree that has been extensively studied as a biodiesel feedstock

[ 81 , 518 , 529 ]. Its oil-rich kernel (40–50% oil content) constitutes up
to 50–60% of the seed and the extracted oil can be efficiently con-
verted into biodiesel via one-step ( i.e. , alkaline-catalyzed transes-
terification) or two-step process ( i.e., FFA esterification followed by
alkaline-transesterification) [ 81 , 518 , 529 ].

Non-edible oil crops respond well to cultivation in rotation with
food/feed  crops,  through  converting  fallow-crop  system  to  crop-
crop system, i.e., more intensive cropping system. The latter sys-
tem significantly improves agronomic and economic aspects [561] ,
such as land availability, minimizing LUC and food insecurity. For
instance,  Chen  et  al.  [561]  studied  a  three-year  replicated  rota-
tion  system,  in  which  Camelina  and  winter  wheat  were  rotated
in  the  Northern  Great  Plains.  Compared  with  fallow-wheat  sys-
tem, 13% less wheat yield (365 kg/ha) were conveniently offset by
the production of 907 kg/ha Camelina [561] . Camelina has a short
life-cycle (2–3 months) and low requirement for water, delivering
up to 45% non-edible oil (290–400 kg/ton) [ 561 , 562 ]. Fröhlich and
Rice [515] reported relatively similar fuel economy for Camelina -
based biodiesel and diesel oil based on vehicle trials. Niger seed
oil ( Guizotia abyssinica L.) is another non-edible crop option which
is well-adapted to poor acidic soils. This oil crop matures within
about  four  months  and  can  be  cultivated  in  rotation  with  some
food crops such as maize and wheat [563] . A seed oil content of
up to 30% can be delivered, whereas the remaining high protein
meal could be used as animal feed [563] . Despite these advantages,
biodiesel production from this oil crop seems unfeasible because of
its low seed yield (5–10 kg/ha) as well as the application of whole
seed as birds’ food in many countries.

It  is  interesting  to  note  that  the  production  cost  of  non-
edible  oils  for  castor  (1188 kg  oil/ha),  jatropha  (1590 kg  oil/ha),
and karanja (225–2250 kg oil/ha) oils are estimated at 0.12, 0.39,
and 0.25 USD/kg, respectively, whereas soybean oil (375 kg oil/ha)
production  costs  1.64  USD/kg  [ 506 , 529 , 564 ].  Although  palm  oil
(50 0 0 kg oil/ha, 0.19 USD/kg) and rapeseed oil (10 0 0 kg oil/ha, 0.34
USD/kg)  could  economically  compete  with  the  above-mentioned
non-edible oils [ 506 , 565 ], they are associated with several short-
comings mentioned earlier. An untapped non-edible oil feedstock
for  biodiesel  could  be  polanga  (65–75%  seed  oil  content)  with
an  oil  yield  of  about  50 0 0 kg/ha,  i.e.,  equal  to  palm  oil  yield
[ 508 , 566 ]. In a thorough investigation, Dinh et al. [507] compared
algae, jatropha, palm oil, rapeseed, and soybean as biodiesel feed-
stock based on economical, sustainability (cultivation feasibility ex-
cluded), and technical criteria. According to the results of analytical
hierarchy process technique, soybean was the most economic op-
tion but was interior from the environmental (GHG emissions, land
usage, water consumption) and biodiesel quality (cetane number,
cloud point, carbon residue) perspectives. Moreover, although palm
oil was the best feedstock in term of biodiesel quality, it was only
slightly  better  than  soybean  in  terms  of  environmental  aspects.
Overall,  algae  followed  by  palm  oil  had  the  highest  total  ranks
based  on  their  suggested  priority  structure  using  the  analytical
hierarchy process technique. In a simulated study [567] , jatropha
biodiesel (USD 0.15/L) followed by WCO biodiesel (USD 0.23/L) had
lower production costs compared with the other investigated oil
feedstocks ( i.e. , palm, microalgae, tallow). Overall, it could be de-
duced  that  non-edible  oils  would  be  better  biodiesel  feedstocks
than edible oils. However, they also could lead to food/feed and
water  insecurity,  to  a  much  lesser  extent  than  edible  oil  plants
though. Therefore, full exploitation of non-edible oil as sustainable
feedstocks  for  biodiesel  production  still  requires  some  improve-
ments with respect to agricultural practices, post-harvest technolo-
gies, and processing techniques [ 464 , 568 ].

Currently, biodiesel costs about 1.5–3 times higher than diesel,
of which the price of oil feedstocks, as mentioned earlier, could
contribute up to 70–95% of the production costs [ 67 , 543 ]. Unfortu-
nately, for many entrepreneurs, economic aspects have the prior-

ity over both environmental and societal aspects. Therefore, it is
the  responsibility  of  those  few  companionate  individuals  to  im-
prove  the  former  aspect  of  biodiesel  production  and  application
while making its production more environmentally sound. One ap-
proach is to force and encourage via legislations, subsidies, or their
combinations defined by policy makers. Alternatively, the more in-
teresting  approach  could  be  scientific  solutions  either  by  intro-
ducing  novel  economically-viable  oil  crops  and/or  by  improving
the characteristics of already-known oil crops. Both approaches re-
quire  careful  and  comprehensive  investigation  with  periodic  up-
dates  on  improvements  in  terms  of  alternative  feedstocks,  their
cultivation  practices,  and  their  conversion  into  biodiesel.  More
specifically, the latter approach involves the presentation of some
environmentally-friendly oil crop species with appropriate charac-
teristics for biodiesel production, such as through identification of
naturally drought- and pest-resistant, high oil-yield crops (prefer-
ably non-edible) that require minimum agricultural practices fol-
lowed by the introduction of agronomic techniques and technolo-
gies to exploit the best out of their cultivations. Castor, karanja, ja-
tropha, linseed, and polanga are some examples of this approach.
Moreover,  this  approach  could  involve  traits  improvements  (oil
traits, agronomic traits) through natural selection or recombinant
technology, the latter commonly referred to as genetically modi-
fied crops. This may even decrease the feedstock cost through co-
production of high-value recombinant products [465] . For instance,
a  transgenic  low-palmitic-acid  ( < 5%)  and  high-oleic-acid  ( > 85%)
soybean was developed by Graef et al. [510] showing stability to-
wards environmental stresses such as production on irrigation and
non-irrigation schemes. Moreover, oil properties and consequently,
fuel characteristics of the resultant biodiesel were also efficiently
improved compared with the conventional soybean oil biodiesel,
i.e. ,  cetane  number  (from  47.2  to  51.5),  cloud  point  (from  −1
to −5 °C), pour point (from 0 to −9 °C), and total glycerol (from
0.097 to 0.068 wt.%) [510] .

4.3.2. Biodiesel production under biorefinery concept

Biodiesel could be produced in a sustainable way under recy-
cling or biorefinery concept from residual oils or crops, such as oil
refinery waste oil streams (acid oil, soapstock, fatty acid distillate,
oil crop pomace) as well as other waste oil feedstocks (animal fats,
WCO, brown or yellow grease, residual oil from food/fruit process-
ing industry, etc .) ( Table 16 ). Collection, transportation, and treat-
ment mainly determine the cost of these promising feedstocks. For
instance, leftover apricot or plum stone from fruit processing in-
dustry could provide low-cost oil feedstock for biodiesel produc-
tion  through  either  one-step  process  and/or  two-step  process  as
they  contain  44.7–57.8  or  32–45.9%  oil,  respectively.  Plum  stone
oil  content  is  relatively  similar  to  those  of  sunflower  and  rape-
seed  but  about  1.6–3.1  times  higher  than  that  of  soybean  seeds
[569] . The possibility of conducting one-step biodiesel production
process from some of these oil feedstocks indicates their low acid
value (FFA contents). Apricot kernel oil biodiesel has been synthe-
sized by Wang [570] displaying a cetane number of 47.2–51.23 and
flash point of 173 °C whereas that obtained from plum kernel oil by
Kosti  ́c et al. [569] showed 57 and 155 °C, respectively. These stud-
ies found kernel oil, from the leftovers of fruit processing indus-
try, promising biodiesel feedstocks as long as efficient oil recov-
ery techniques are conducted. Nevertheless, appropriate genotype
must  be  selected  and  established  by  agricultural  studies  as  well
as by cloning techniques to further improve both productivity and
quality of these fruits including their kernel.

Soapstock  is  a  by-product  of  oil  refinery  industry,  produced
when crude vegetable oil is refined from FFAs by agitation with
alkali. The typical generation rate of soapstock is about 6% of the
total  crude  oil  input  [580] .  The  high  lipid  content  of  soapstock,
together  with  its  low  market  value  of  about  0.11  USD/kg  dried

soapstock  (20%  of  the  crude  soybean  oil  price)  makes  it  an  at-
tractive feedstock for biodiesel production [581] . Once soapstock
4 -treated,  acid  oil  containing  long-chain  FFAs  along  with
is  H
traces of other compounds are generated. Other by-product of oil
refinery industry is fatty acid distillate generated in the final de-
odorization stage. All  of these low-cost  by-products can be con-
verted into biodiesel. For example, Haas [581] successfully synthe-
sized soybean soapstock methyl esters with promising fuel proper-
ties, i.e., flash point of 169 °C, carbon residue of 0.01 wt.%, cetane
number,  51.3,  and  cloud  point  of  6 °C.  Moreover,  biodiesel  pro-
duction  cost  was  decreased  by  23%,  compared  with  soy-based
biodiesel.  Alternatively,  the  oil  crop  residues  from  oil  refinery
may  also  be  further  processed  and  used  as  biodiesel  feedstock.
For  instance,  olive  pomace  oil  has  been  successfully  converted
into  biodiesel  reducing  up  to  43–51%  GHG  emissions  relative  to
petroleum-based No. 2 diesel [ 499 , 582 ]. It has also been argued
that the total carbon footprint of olive pomace oil biodiesel could
be further decreased by improving agricultural practices as 48–60%
of the emissions were attributed to these practices [499] . Resid-
ual olive oil has similarly been considered as biodiesel feedstock
to  increase  the  economic  profitability  of  olive  oil  refinery  plant
[583] .

Waste animal fats (WAFs) such as beef tallow, chicken fat, duck
tallow, lard, mutton fat, etc. are another group of waste oils that
can be used as biodiesel feedstock. A cheap by-product of meat
industry is tallow, produced in a centralized manner in slaughter-
ing houses,  processing facilities or  by rendering operations.  Beef
tallow,  for  example,  can  be  divided  into  edible  and  non-edible
fats and the latter is traditionally used as animal feed supplement
(main  market),  soap,  and  lubricants  [584] .  In  recent  years,  the
trade of tallow as well as its shipment for the above-mentioned
applications has been negatively affected by risk of transmission
of  bovine  spongiform  encephalopathy.  However,  these  tallowate
feedstocks can be safely converted into value-added product, i.e. ,
biodiesel costing about 0.38 USD/L [584] . It should be noted that
higher  transesterification  reaction  temperature  is  commonly  re-
quired  for  the  conversion  of  WAFs  into  biodiesel  than  vegetable
oils  due  to  high  saturated  fatty  acid  (SFA)  content  of  WAFs  (up
to 61.1%) [538] . An exception is chicken fats (30–33% of SFA) that
tend to be liquid or in semi-solid form. Chicken fat ( i.e. , skin and
visible fat) is another largely available leftover from the meat in-
dustry in leading poultry-producing countries, constituting up to
8–20% of chicken carcass weight and have direct relationship with
chicken weight [585] . For example, considering Iran chicken pro-

289

duction  (2.5  million  ton/annum) and  Iranian people tendency  to
buy larger chickens, up to 500 ton/annum chicken fat is produced.
The oil can be conventionally extracted from chicken fat by melt-
ing technique (90–100 °C) or by more recent techniques utilizing
microwave heating or ultrasonic irradiations [586] , followed by its
one-step or two-step process conversion into biodiesel.

An alternative feedstock considered under the biorefinery con-
cept is WCO whose conversion into biodiesel would provide a safe
and  economic  disposal  method  for  this  waste  as  well.  WCO  is
largely produced (11 million ton/annum in the US only) as a left-
over from preparation or cooking of foods and is no longer suit-
able for the consumption by humans or animals [67] . WCOs may
be divided into yellow and brown greases, typically containing less
than and more than 15% FFAs, respectively. They could be consid-
ered as promising biodiesel feedstocks because they are cheap and
readily available. For example, yellow grease of soybean oil is avail-
able at a market value of about 0.27 USD/L in 2018 [587] compared
with  virgin  soybean  oil  price  of  about  0.67  USD/L  in  the  same
year. The production of biodiesel from WCO could be at very rea-
sonable price even in oil-rich countries such as Iran ( ∼0.61 USD/L
biodiesel) [67] .

WCO  has  relatively  same  physicochemical  characteristics  to
those  of  virgin  cooking  oil  but  with  higher  FFAs  and  water
content,  requiring  an  appropriate  pretreatment  before  alkaline-
catalyzed  transesterification  reaction.  Some  pretreatment  tech-
niques for removing FFAs from WCO include (solid)acid-catalyzed
trans(esterification), glycerolysis, silica gel pretreatment, and vac-
uum distillation [ 588–591 ]. Vacuum distillation is used to trap FFAs
when  their  content  is  between  3  and  15%.  Glycerolysis  process
involves the  addition of  glycerin  to  retrieve FFAs  in  the  form  of
monoglycerides at ∼204.5 °C [591] . Acid or solid acid is generally
used for WCOs with higher than 15% FFAs content and converts
FFAs to esters. The main advantage of solid acid over acid esterifi-
cation is its immiscibility with oil, and hence, no purification step
and consequently no wastewater treatment are required. It should
be noted that even oil feedstocks with high FFAs (such as WCOs,
non-edible oils) can be directly converted into biodiesel using su-
percritical method (see Section 2.3.3 ) for simultaneous conversion
of FFAs and triglycerides into biodiesel. From the quality perspec-
tive, a proper pretreatment process guarantees similar characteris-
tics of biodiesels produced from WCO and virgin cooking oil [588] .
In an interesting study on the various aspects of WCO biodiesel
using  LCA,  Moecke  et  al.  [592]  considered  WCO-based  biodiesel
(200 L/day) production in a plant in the vicinity of Pinheira Beach
(Santa  Catarina,  Brazil).  They  advocated  the  economic,  environ-
mental, and societal gains of the plant for the community. How-
ever, based on their results, oil collection was the most polluting
stage of biodiesel production (92.1% contribution) in terms of to-
tal GHG emissions (2.23 tCO
2-eq /t biodiesel). This highlights that a
well-managed collection system must be implemented to increase
the carbon pay efficiency as well as economic profitability of the
WCO-based  biodiesel  plants  through  reducing  fuel  consumption
for feedstock collection. For example, total CO
2-eq  emission from
biodiesel production could be decreased by up to 23% reaching 1.72
tCO
2-eq /t biodiesel in the same study [592] if fossil fuel (petroleum)
was replaced by B50 (biodiesel 50%) in the WCO-vehicle collection
system. Alternatively, centralized WCO-based biodiesel production
plants could be by the decentralized ones to minimize the envi-
ronmental and even economic burdens associated with waste col-
lection and transportation [593] .

An  important  consideration  in  further  economizing  any
biodiesel production chains would be glycerol upgrading for pro-
duction of value-added products and hence, reducing the biodiesel
production  cost.  Crude  glycerol  (containing  water,  salts,  alcohol,
biodiesel, mono and diglycerides, FFAs, soap, etc. ) generated dur-
ing biodiesel production cannot be applied for cosmetic, food, and

pharmaceutical  industries  unless  it  is  purified.  Nevertheless,  the
purification steps are highly expensive with respect to operation
and  equipment  costs  [574] .  Alternatively,  crude  glycerol  can  be
used as a feedstock for synthesis of a number of different chemi-
cals through (i) reduction or oxidation process, or (ii) reaction with
other  chemicals,  forming  other  three  carbon  molecules  or  new
chemical species, respectively. The application of cheap oxidizing
agents ( e.g., oxygen, air, bleach, hydrogen peroxide) for transform-
ing glycerol allows inexpensive production and in turn, industrial
application of some value-added products including, Glyceric, Hy-
droxypyruvic, Mesoxalic and Tartronic acids, and Dihydroxyacetone
compounds [ 594 , 595 ] ( Table 17 ). Additionally, aqueous phase re-
forming ( i.e., moderate pressure, low temperatures) could be ap-
plied  for  breaking  glycerol  into  gaseous  ( i.e.,  containing  mainly
H
2 ) and liquid ( i.e., acids, alcohols, aldehydes, esters, ketones, etc. )
phases.  Among  them,  1,2-propanediol  ( Table  17 )  is  used  in  syn-
thesis of polyurethanes, polycarbonates, polyesters, resistant textile
fibers and carpet, food products ( i.e., solvent for flavoring and col-
oring), emulsifiers, other solvents, and plasticizers [ 595 , 596 ]. More-
over,  1,2-propanediol  is  applied  as  component  in  cosmetics,  lu-
bricants, hydrolytic fluids, and anti-freezing agents [574] . Another
group of compounds, i.e., polyglycerols and their esters could be
obtained through etherification of glycerol for application in cos-
metics, food additives, and surfactants [594] . The halogenation of
glycerol  leads  to  production  of  epichlorohydrin  (significant  feed-
stock in papermaking industry) with 1,3-dichloropropanol as an in-
termediate, consuming hydrochloric acid ( i.e., chlorination agent)
and lower water while generating lower chlorinated residues [597] .
Anaerobic digestion, fermentation, pyrolysis, and gasification of
glycerol are also possible [598] . The main product of anaerobic di-
gestion  of  glycerol  (or  its  co-digestion  with  other  feedstocks)  is
4 with acetate, butyrate, and propionate as major intermediates
CH
[599] .  Whilst  the  fermentation  of  glycerol  delivers  some  similar
compounds to anaerobic digestion ( i.e., acetate, butyrate, and H
2 ),
it also generates butanol, ethanol, and lactate [574] . The products
of low temperature pyrolysis of glycerol mainly include acetalde-
2 , and
hyde, formaldehyde, and acrolein whereas ethylene, H
4 are dominant at higher temperatures [ 574 , 594 ]. On the other
CH
hand, gasification process decomposes glycerol into H
2  and syn-
gas  which  are  suitable  for  energy  application  [600] .  In  addition
2  could  be  pro-
to  gasification  and  aqueous  phase  reforming,  H
duced from glycerol ( i.e., in 4:1 ratio) by auto-thermal reforming
and steam/water reforming processes [ 601 , 602 ]. Similarly, a num-
ber of different fuel additives could be formed from chemical mod-
ification of glycerol via acetalization, etherification, ketalization, or
methylation process ( Table 17 ). Ketal derivatives of glycerol could
stabilize biodiesel with respect to oxidation, iodine, and viscosity
while improving its cold-flow characteristics [603] . An engineered
bacterium, Escherichia coli strain YL15 efficiently consumes glycerol
to  metabolize fatty  acids forming glycerol esters  with  a yield of
813 mg/L [604] . Isobutylene and 1-butene could be used for ether-
ification of glycerol for the production of some biodiesel additives
including dibutoxy glycerol as well as propyl glycerol ethers and
butyl glycerol ethers, respectively [ 605 , 606 ].

Overall,  upgrading  biodiesel-derived  glycerol  not  only  could
economize  the  production  of  biodiesel  but  also  could  mitigate
its environmental impacts. Table 17 tabulates some glycerol-based
value-added products as well as their potential commercial appli-
cations.

4.4. Social acceptance of biodiesel

There have been significant efforts for the introduction of low-
carbon biofuels such as biodiesel into the transport sector. The lev-
els  of  success  were  different  from  country  to  country  and  even
one community to another. Regardless of the cost, other social ac-

ceptance criteria (discussed hereafter) of any biofuels play decisive
roles in its commercial feasibility.

Public awareness, opinion, and knowledge could contribute to
the  social  acceptance  of  any  biofuels  including  biodiesel.  Moula
et al. [612] studied the social acceptance of biofuels for transport

in Finland. Interestingly, none of the respondents considered biofu-
els as the most ideal energy carrier. More specifically, up to 50% of
the respondents raised fuel vs. food debate while others had either
not enough information on biofuels or disappointed by their un-
availability or high prices at fuel stations. Similar results ( i.e., avail-

291

ability at fuel stations and price) were obtained by Gracia et al.
[613] who examined Spanish biodiesel market for identifying pa-
rameters influencing biodiesel acceptance in the transport sector.
If these two parameters were comparable to those of diesel, about
50% of car drivers would definitely consume biodiesel. The number
of biodiesel users would drop to 20% or 30% when only one of the
mentioned factors were comparable to that of its fossil counter-
part ( i.e., availability or price, respectively) [613] . Nevertheless, the
study emphasized that the use of biodiesel was also avoided due to
lack of knowledge ( i.e., only 20% of the car drivers surveyed knew
what biodiesel was). Generally, higher degree of willingness-to-pay
for renewable energy projects could be found in people (mainly
younger females) with higher environmental awareness, and more
income and education [ 613 , 614 ].

From a different viewpoint, Amin et al. [615] studied the so-
cial acceptance of biodiesel with respect to Malaysian stakehold-
ers’ willingness to commit palm-based biodiesel development and
commercialization. Intriguingly, it was determined that perceived
benefits  ( e.g. ,  health  and  social  aspects)  were  the  most  signifi-
cant direct predictor for stakeholders’ attitude towards biodiesel.
The other important interconnected determinants were willingness
for engagement in biodiesel technology ( i.e., knowledge, awareness,
etc. ), trust in key players ( i.e., scientists, industry, and policy mak-
ers), attitude towards technology, and perceived risk ( e.g., environ-
mental, human health, moral, and societal issues) [615] .

In conclusion, the social acceptance must be improved in par-
allel  to  biodiesel  development  and  commercialization.  Whatever
the  reasons  are  behind  social  repellents  of  biodiesel  ( i.e.,  lack
of knowledge, perceived risks, negative attitude towards technol-
ogy, biodiesel unavailability or high price, and lack of trust), they
must be carefully assessed and addressed properly. It should also
be  noted  that  these  concerns  have  different  magnitudes  of  ef-
fect among people with different social status. Finally, whilst the
concerns about price and availability could be partially removed
through mandatory policies, these policies would be ineffective if
the  other  above-mentioned  social  acceptance  concerns  were  not
sufficiently addressed.

5. Concluding remarks and future prospects

Different types of transesterification reactors (tubular/plug-flow
reactors, rotating reactors, simultaneous reaction-separation reac-
tors, cavitational reactors, and microwave reactors) employed for
converting natural oils and fats into biodiesel as well as their lim-
itations and deficiencies have been comprehensively reviewed in
this article. In order to better understand the mechanisms behind
each reactor technology, the effects of the main influential param-
eters on the transesterification process have also been discussed in
detail. Biodiesel production has been scrutinized from the biofuel
policies and mandates, economic aspects and impacts, and feed-
stock  sustainability  perspectives.  Moreover,  biodiesel  production
under biorefinery concept utilizing waste-oriented oils and glycerol
upgrading to various value-added products have been elaborated
as well. It is worth mentioning that the present article is the first
to  comprehensively  review  and  discuss  all  the  above-mentioned
aspects as a whole ( Table 18 ).

Overall, the economic profitability of biodiesel production via
transesterification  reaction  markedly  depends  on  various  process
parameters, viz. process intensification method, quantity and type
of alcohol, quantity and type of catalyst, composition of oil, resi-
dence time, and temperature. Among acidic, basic, and enzymatic
catalysts applied to speed up the transesterification process, basic
catalysts are the most promising type tolerating harsh operating
conditions while accelerating the reaction up to 40 0 0 times. How-
ever, a high concentration of basic catalyst as well as the presence
of water and free fatty acid decreases biodiesel yield by forming

soap as side-product. Methanol is the most common type of alco-
hol for economic biodiesel production. Alcohol-to-oil molar ratios
of above six are often used to induce the formation of biodiesel.

The  most  commonly  used  process  mode  for  commercial  pro-
duction of biodiesel is still batch operation. However, continuous
process  mode  requires  lower  space,  capital,  and  operating  cost
while it also guarantees a product with uniform quality. This pro-
cess  mode  is  suitable  for  quick  reaction  and  provides  superior
heat transfer and high selectivity compared with the batch pro-
cess mode. Accordingly, the biodiesel industry is shifting toward
the continuous process mode to address the drawbacks associated
with the batch process operation.

It is clear that there is no perfect reactor technology for trans-
esterifying natural oils and fats since each technology has its own
pros and cons. In the majority of developed transesterification re-
actors,  various  process  intensification  techniques  have  been  em-
ployed  to  improve  the  economic  profitability  of  the  process.  In
general,  BSTRs  have  been  extensively  applied  at  industrial  scale
due  to  its  simplicity  and  low-cost  fabrication,  even  though  they
suffer from low efficiency and serious instability. It should be men-
tioned that ACCs, shockwave power reactor, STT reactor, and ultra-
sonic reactor have also been reached or applied at industrial scale
to date for transesterification of natural oils and fats into biodiesel.
Tubular  reactors  provide  a  more  efficient  and  economic  plat-
form  for  blending  when  quick  mixing,  short  hold-ups,  and  low
maintenance are desirable. Although tubular reactors require lower
capital  and  space  for  construction,  they  have  a  limitation  for
Reynolds numbers. Moreover, these reactors experience significant
temperature and pressure changes at different points between in-
let and outlet, negatively affecting heat and mass transfer coeffi-
cients. In rotating reactors, intense mechanical agitation facilitates
mass and heat transfer and decreases retention time of reactants
and  reagents.  The  main  problems  associated  with  these  reactors
are their lower efficiency as well as the difficulty of process con-
trol. Using reaction-separation reactors, better quality and higher
yield of conversion could be achieved due to excellent mixing. Nev-
ertheless,  upscaling  these  reactors  for  commercial  application  is
slightly difficult and complex. Cavitational reactors provide more
narrowly dispersed and more stable emulsions than the conven-
tional techniques, which in turn boost the reaction rate. These re-
actors require lower alcohol-to-oil molar ratios, lower catalyst con-
centrations, lower temperatures, and shorter residence times than
the conventional STRs. However, complex scale up and cavitational
blocking are the main disadvantages of these systems. Simple con-
trol, time and thermal efficiencies, clean products, and less down-
stream  processing  are  the  main  advantages  of  microwave  reac-
tors. However, difficulty in controlling power and temperature and,
thereby, low process reproducibility is the main problems associ-
ated with microwave reactors.

Generally speaking, the interest in advanced transesterification
reactor is growing due to the need for reducing capital cost, energy
and water consumption, space requirement, reaction time, waste
streams,  and  environmental  burdens  while  improving  biodiesel
quality and boosting conversion efficiency. Nevertheless, the main
barriers  for  the  commercial  application  of  advanced  transesteri-
fication reactors applied for converting natural oils and fats into
biodiesel are their high construction costs and difficult scalability.
Accordingly, it is vital to develop inexpensive and scalable versa-
tile transesterification reactors that are applicable to various feed-
stocks with different qualities. In addition, emerging technologies
have a chance to replace the traditional ones, if they are proved to
be economically profitable and environmentally sustainable using
advanced engineering approaches.

It  should  be  noted  that  the  appropriate  selection  of  sustain-
able  feedstock  is  the  most  crucial  criterion  in  biodiesel  produc-
tion  feasibility  as  feedstock  makes  up  the  majority  of  produc-

tion  cost.  Apart  from  the  economic  considerations,  any  sustain-
able feedstock for biodiesel production must be classified as non-
edible  ( i.e.  not  triggering  food  vs .  fuel  debate)  while  requiring
low  water  footprint  ( i.e.,  not  triggering  water  vs.  fuel  debate)
for  its  cultivation  and  oil  extraction.  Moreover,  such  a  feedstock
should  confirm  a  minimal  GHG-emissions  mitigation  of  35%  in
comparison  with  GHG  emissions  arisen  from  the  synthesis  and
application  of  petroleum  fuels.  The  production  of  biodiesel  un-
der  biorefinery  concept  can  also  address  some ‏
‏controversial  is-
sues  associated  with  large-scale  biodiesel  production  while  pro-
viding some environmental and economic benefits. Biodiesel pro-
duction  from  waste-oriented  oils  is  a  good  example  for  this
approach  but  requires  an  elaborated  management  for  feedstock
collection.
