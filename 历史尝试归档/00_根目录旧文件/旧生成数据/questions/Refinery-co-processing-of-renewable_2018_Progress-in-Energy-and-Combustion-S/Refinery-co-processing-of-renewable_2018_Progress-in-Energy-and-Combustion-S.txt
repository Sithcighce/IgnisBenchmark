Biofuels are called upon to play an important role, not only in reducing the associated greenhouse-gases
emissions, but also in enabling the gradual independence from fossil sources, rendering low-carbon-highly-
sustainable fuels. Today, the involvement of biomass-derived sources into existing petroleum refineries has
a growing interest due to the increasing unpredictability of oil prices, environmental concerns and the
necessity to secure an energy supply. Petroleum refineries already have a well-developed infrastructure to
produce fuels and base chemicals and, consequently, would not require additional intensive investments
for processing of alternative feedstocks. From this point of view, co-processing of biomass-derived feed-
stocks with petroleum fractions is an attractive option, which has already been industrially demonstrated
in some cases. There are two main technologies that could be used for co-processing of biomass feedstocks
with petroleum fractions, the first one being catalytic hydroprocessing and the second one being fluid cata-
lytic cracking (FCC). Both technologies are found in virtually any conventional refinery. It is obvious that the
co-processing of biomass-based feedstocks with petroleum fractions has the potential to play an important
role in the near future. There are several research studies in literature that examine both technologies for
co-processing. However, while there are many technological reviews that focus on stand-alone biofuel pro-
duction (e.g., FAME biodiesel, bioethanol, HVO etc.), a dedicated technological review on co-processing for
production of hybrid fuels is still missing. Therefore, this paper is focused on presenting a state-of-the-art
review on co-processing bio-based feedstocks with petroleum fractions via hydroprocessing and fluid cata-
lytic cracking, looking at different potential feedstocks, catalysts, operating conditions, products and bene-
fits in detail. As there is no specifically dedicated literature review in this field, the content of this review
provides a guideline on co-processing of different bio-based feedstocks with petroleum fractions, aimed at
delivering a technological assessment of the existing research efforts.

1. Introduction

The world-wide depletion of crude oil and greenhouse-gases
(GHG) emissions associated with the transportation sector has
imposed the need for specific energy and climate targets towards
energy security and solidarity via a growing decarbonized economy.
Particularly for the transportation sector, biofuels are highlighted to
play an important role, not only in reducing the associated GHG
emissions, but also in enabling the gradual independence from fossil
sources, rendering low-carbon-highly-sustainable fuels. Over the
last several years, the EU and other countries have established spe-
cific action plans for the promotion of biofuels (Directive 2003/30/
EC, Renewable Energy Directive 2009/28/EC, Amendment to the Fuel
Quality Directive 2009/30/EC, etc.). On the 30th of November 2016,
the Commission published its so-called ‘Winter Package’ of eight
proposals to keep the European Union competitive as the clean
energy transition changes the global energy markets. The Commis-
sion, backed by the Council, has embraced an ambitious plan for the
European Union's electricity market. It will be a major instrument in
realizing the transition to a low carbon economy by 2050. This
means that EU citizens, as well as industrial users, should gradually
switch to electricity not only as a source of light, heating and cooling,
but also transportation. That electricity should, in turn, be generated
or produced from low carbon sources, including, not only, non-fossil
fuels such as hydro, solar and wind energy, but also biofuels, biomass
and biogases [1]. It is obvious that biofuels are going to play a very
important role in the near future.

The first-generation biofuels (biodiesel and bioethanol) are based
on energy crops which limit their environmental benefits (GHG
emissions) while leading to incompatibility problems with their fos-
sil-based counterparts and combustion systems. For example, FAME
(Free Fatty Acids Methyl Esters) biodiesel, produced via the transes-
terification of vegetable oils (sunflower, rape, soy, jatropha, etc.) has
raised economic, environmental and social implications due to the
associated ‘‘food versus fuel’’ debate, problematic by-products (glyc-
erol) utilization, and fuel quality characteristics. More specifically,
FAME's high viscosity, low energy content, high oxygen and water
content, as well as high cloud and pour point, render technical limi-
tations regarding its end-use (injector coking in diesel engines,
microbial contamination of fuel tanks, quality degradation during
long term storage [2(cid:1)4], etc.). Similar limitations are also reported

for the first-generation ethanol. Furthermore, air transport has
acquired a significant role in the everyday life of the modern world.
Consequently, there is increased interest in alternative fuels for avia-
tion [5]. Aviation fuels are characterized by high energy density and,
therefore, their production depends mainly on liquid hydrocarbon
fuels. Moreover, good flow properties, thermal stability and low
freezing are other important criteria that have to be met by alterna-
tive aviation fuels [6]. Consequently, FAME biodiesel is not accept-
able as an aviation fuel due to its low energy density and high
freezing point in comparison with jet fuels.

Due to all these disadvantages of the first-generation biofuels,
alternative biofuels technologies are being explored. Today, the
involvement of biomass-derived sources into existing petroleum
refineries has a growing interest due to the increasing unpredictabil-
ity of oil prices, environmental concerns (e.g., increasing CO2 level
and climate change), and the necessity to secure an energy supply
[7]. Petroleum refineries already have a well-developed infrastruc-
ture to produce fuels and base chemicals and, consequently, would
not require additional intensive investments for the processing of
alternative feedstocks. From this point of view, co-processing of bio-
mass-derived feedstocks with petroleum fractions is an attractive
option, which in some cases has found its practical realization
already [8(cid:1)12]. There are two main technologies that could be used
for the co-processing of biomass feedstock with petroleum fractions,
the first one is catalytic hydroprocessing and the second one is fluid
catalytic cracking (FCC). Both technologies are found in virtually any
conventional refinery, as indicated in Fig. 1.

As far as catalytic hydroprocessing is concerned, it is a well-
established and commonly-used refining technology generally
employed to upgrade petroleum distillate fractions. There are two
types of hydroprocessing technologies: catalytic hydrotreating
(HDT) and catalytic hydrocracking (HDC), both of which are nor-
mally expected in a typical refinery, as depicted in Fig. 1. The cata-
lytic hydrotreatment process is aimed at removing undesirable
heteroatoms such as sulfur, nitrogen and oxygen as well as metals
and the partial reduction (hydrogenation) of aromatics. It is applied
to intermediate refinery streams which are fed to various conversion
units (e.g., FCC feed hydrotreating, naphtha pretreating prior to
reforming, etc.). Catalytic hydrocracking is a conversion process that
mainly aims to reduce the boiling point of petroleum fractions. Its
feedstocks are generally heavier petroleum intermediate products

such as heavy gas oil, vacuum gas oil, etc. In fact, as the sulfur and
aromatics specifications become stricter (i.e., 10 ppm sulfur in diesel,
the progressive reduction of aromatics) and the available crudes
become heavier and sourer (higher sulfur amounts), catalytic hydro-
processing technologies are becoming dominant conversion units.

Over the last several years, catalytic hydroprocessing has been
employed as an advanced biofuels technology over a wide range of
bio-based feedstocks, primarily lipids, also. In general, the technol-
ogy is currently available on an industrial scale, rendering hydro-
treated vegetable oils (HVOs) or “green diesel” produced from edible
lipids or “white diesel” produced from used cooking oils as “drop in”
biofuels [13] for road transportation as well as the aviation sector
[14]. The first commercial scale hydroprocessing plant for green die-
sel production, with a capacity of 170,000,000 metric tons per year
was started up in the summer of 2007 at Neste Oil's Porvoo oil refin-
ery in Finland. This technology is branded as ‘‘NExBTL’’ [8, 13, 15].
The produced biofuels are mainly paraffins in diesel, gasoline and jet
fuel range, depending on the catalyst and operating conditions, with
a high cetane number, a high heating value and a zero oxygen con-
tent [16]. The most important advantage of this technology includes
high flexibility regarding the feedstock without compromising fuel
quality [13]. During the catalytic hydroprocessing of bio-based feed-
stocks H2O, CO, CO2 and C3H8 are produced as side products. Never-
theless, such a technology is associated with high investment costs,
which justifies high throughput plants only.

To minimize the high investment costs, the co-hydroprocessing
of heavy petroleum fractions with bio-based feedstocks is currently
being investigated, utilizing the underlying conversion capacity of
existing refineries. This approach renders low-carbon hybrid (of par-
tially bio- and partially fossil-origin) fuels of increased sustainability,

while enabling the gradual decarbonization of the transportation
and aviation sector via a biomass infusion in refineries. In addition,
co-hydroprocessing has the potential of valorizing a variety of bio-
based feedstocks including lipids, pyrolysis bio-oils, etc., enabling
operational flexibility and feedstock availability. The difference of
stand-alone hydroprocessing of bio-based feedstocks for drop-in
biofuels, which are blended with upgraded petroleum fractions lead-
ing to conventional fuels vs the co-processing approach rendering
hybrid fuels, are compared in Fig. 2.

Regarding fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), it is the most widely
used process in the petrochemical refinery for the conversion of the
heavy fractions of crude oil (e.g., vacuum gas oil (VGO) or long resi-
due (LR)) to produce gasoline and propylene as the key products and
other hydrocarbon fractions, such as C4 olefins or a middle distillate,
i.e., light cycle oil (LCO) [17, 18]. It is also among the refinery pro-
cesses which can be successfully used for the co-processing of bio-
mass-derived feedstocks and petroleum fractions. Oxygen which is
abundantly present in bio-components is removed as CO/CO2 and
water during co-processing in FCC. Simultaneously, coke formed
during the process can be successfully burned during the regenera-
tion of a catalyst and the generated heat is used to provide heat for
the FCC unit, i.e., the catalyst acts as a heat carrier that supplies the
energy needed for the endothermic cracking reaction to take place.
In this way, all energy contained in the bio-feed is fully utilized in
the process. The separation of water from hydrocarbons does not
seem to be a problem. Moreover, some options to involve water into
the water-gas shift reaction have been discussed by Corma et al.
[18].

lignocellulosic- and

triglycerides-based feedstocks were considered by Huber and Corma
[19] and St€ocker [20]. Nonetheless, the integration of catalytic crack-
ing of petroleum-based feedstock with cracking of biomass-derived
feedstocks to occur in a single FCC reactor remains a hot topic for
investigation. The transformations of hydrocarbon fractions that
occur in the FCC process include cracking reactions (cracking of alka-
nes, alkenes, naphthenes, and alkyl aromatics to lighter products),
hydrogen transfer, isomerization, and coking reactions [21]. Addi-
tionally, Corma et al. [18] have proposed that the conversion of oxy-
genates from biomass-derived feedstocks in the FCC mainly occurs
through a series involving five different classes of reactions: 1) dehy-
dration reactions, 2) cracking of large oxygenated molecules to
smaller molecules, 3) hydrogen-producing reactions, 4) hydrogen
consuming reactions, and 5) production of larger molecules by C(cid:1)(cid:1)C
bond-forming reactions (aldol condensation or Diels(cid:1)Alder reac-
tions). All these reactions take place simultaneously, under FCC co-
processing conditions, and their combination determines the chemi-
cal composition and characteristics of the final product.

Several reviews considering the FCC co-processing of biomass-
derived and petroleum-derived feedstocks have been published to
date [22(cid:1)25]. While valuable information and conclusions related to
co-processing of bio-based feedstocks have been provided, the infor-
mation and relevant conclusions on the implementation of bio-
based feedstocks co-processing in industrial FCC technology is
scarce.

It is obvious that the co-processing of biomass-based feedstocks
with petroleum fractions has the potential to play an important role
in the near future. There are several research studies in the literature
that examine both technologies (hydroprocessing and fluid catalytic
cracking) for co-processing. However, while there are many techno-
logical reviews that focus on stand-alone biofuel production (e.g.,
FAME biodiesel, bioethanol, HVO, etc.), a technological review on co-
processing for hybrid fuels production is scarce. There are only a few
reviews published in recent years that deal with co-processing. The
review of Melero et al. [26] is focused mostly on chemistry, catalysis
and challenges involved in the production of biofuels from biomass
in conventional refineries, however it does not discuss the effect of
the operating conditions, type of catalyst and biomass to fossil feed-
stock blending ratios in detail. Similarly, the two reviews of Al-
Sabawi et al. [22, 27] consider the use of biomass-derived oils and
their blends with petroleum feedstocks in hydroprocessing and FCC
processing, respectively. However, a major part of these reviews

deals with the processing of either individual bio-derived oils or
model compounds. Consequently, a detailed discussion on the tech-
nological aspects is not provided. Moreover, there have been new
developments since these three reviews were published in 2012.
The very recent review of Stefanidis et al. [28] is focused very nar-
rowly (cid:1) it considers only FCC co-processing of petroleum feeds with
differently prepared bio-oils.

Therefore, this paper is focused on presenting a state-of-the-art
review on co-processing bio-based feedstocks with petroleum frac-
tions via co-hydroprocessing and via fluid catalytic cracking, looking
at different potential feedstocks, catalysts, operating conditions,
products and benefits in detail. As a result, the content of this review
provides a recent guideline on co-processing of different bio-based
feedstocks with petroleum fractions, aimed at delivering a techno-
logical assessment of the existing research efforts in which goes
beyond the previous reviews addressing co-processing of bio-based
feedstocks.

2. Feedstocks

One of the main advantages of co-processing is the ability to
combine a variety of bio- and fossil-based feedstocks/fractions with-
out compromising product quality. Moreover, due to co-processing,
fossil feedstocks can be saved and used in other processes. In this
section, the range of fossil- and bio-based feedstocks that are being
co-processed are determined and compared.

2.1. Petroleum fractions

Before examining the key bio-based feedstocks that can be intro-
duced in a refinery via co-processing, the fossil-based fractions that
are the best candidates for co-processing with bio-based feedstocks
should be examined. The most commonly used fossil based feeds for
co-hydroprocessing according to literature are straight run gas oil
(SRGO) [29(cid:1)32], straight run diesel, also called light atmospheric
gas oil (LAGO) [33(cid:1)36], heavy atmospheric gas oil (HAGO) [37] and
heavy vacuum gas oil (HVGO) [38]. The fossil-based FCC feedstocks
also suitable for co-processing applications include distillate frac-
tions, such as vacuum- and heavy vacuum gas-oils or FCC cycle oils
(light and heavy cycle oils), as well as atmospheric distillation resi-
due, i.e., short or long residue. The properties of petroleum-based
feedstocks are presented in Table 1.

Straight run gas oil (SRGO) is obtained by crude oil distillation
and is the dominant feedstock for diesel fuel production. It is charac-
terized by a low aromatic content, a high cetane index and a boiling
point range from 234 °C to 350 °C [39, 40]. SRGO is a good candidate
for co-processing due to its low sulfur content and a suitable boiling
point range. Due to its favorable properties, SRGO has been exam-
ined as feedstock for co-hydroprocessing [41, 42].

Other possible streams for diesel production like light cycle
oil (LCO) are only used sparingly. Light cycle oil (LCO) is a lighter
petroleum product characterized by a high sulfur, nitrogen and
aromatic content and a low cetane number/index. It contains a
large amount of gas oil boiling point range multi-substituted aro-
matics (40(cid:1)60%) and tetralins (20(cid:1)30%), in which the side chains
are very short paraffins, so their cetane numbers are low [42].
Nevertheless, the increasing presence of fluid catalytic cracking
units (FCC) in conversion refineries produces large amounts of
LCO. The quality of LCO could be improved by itself or by the
conversion together with other refinery streams and/or in mix-
tures of alternative raw materials [43]. With the co-processing of
triglycerides and middle distillates (e.g., LCO containing gas oils)
not only can the applicability of the low-quality gas oil fractions
as fuel be solved, but diesel fuel with a biocomponent content
can be produced. In general, a common practice is to feed LCO in
a mixture with SRGO to the hydrotreater [44]. For the above rea-
son, LCO is a feedstock that is not preferable for co-hydropro-
cessing by itself with lipid-based feeds.
the co-
hydroprocessing of blends of SRGO and LCO and bio-based feeds
is preferred [4]. Several studies have examined co-hydroprocess-
ing blends of SRGO and LCO with different types of lipids. For
instance, the co-hydroprocessing of different prepared mixtures
from straight run gas oil (70(cid:1)100%), light cycle oil (0(cid:1)10%) and
waste animal fat (0(cid:1)20%) was carried out to yield fuels that
would satisfy the requirements of the EN 590:2013 standard [4,
41]. A similar study of co-hydroprocessing was also carried out
for a straight run gas oil (70(cid:1)85%),
light cycle oil (15%) and
waste cooking oil (0(cid:1)15%) mixture [42].

Instead,

Light Atmospheric Gas Oil (LAGO) is a cheap liquid petroleum
distillate heavier than naphtha, with an approximate boiling range
from 205 °C to 343 °C, low TAN (0.45 mg KOH g¡1) and 12 °C pour
point. Heavy Atmospheric Gas Oil (HAGO) is a heavier petroleum
distillate compared to LAGO, with a high sulfur content and is also
used for diesel production. A common practice for these two feed-
stocks is to pass them through hydrotreaters to reduce the sulfur
content and break the large molecules, rendering high quality blend-
ing components for diesel production [45(cid:1)47]. Both LAGO and
HAGO have been examined for co-hydroprocessing with lipid-based
feedstocks for hybrid fuel production. LAGO has been tested in dif-
ferent blends with waste soya oil [48], sunflower oil [29, 32], rape-
seed oil [35], tallow oil [35] and tall oil [35]. While HAGO was

examined in blends with waste cooking oil during co-hydroprocess-
ing [45(cid:1)47, 49].

Heavy Vacuum Gas Oil or HVGO is part of the petroleum hydro-
carbon heavy distillate family. HVGO is produced in a Vacuum Distil-
lation Unit, through the separation of the heaviest fraction from the
atmospheric distillation column. It is a heavy and viscous product
and is only used as an intermediary. It is also known as cat feed,
which is feedstock for fluid catalytic crackers used to make gasoline,
gasoil and many other by-products. There are two main uses of
HVGO. The first one is for gasoline production via the fluidized cata-
lytic cracker which is a refining unit that cracks the HVGO in the
presence of a catalyst, to produce a gasoline rich mix of products.
And the second one is for diesel and kerosene production via a
hydrocracker which is a refining unit that cracks the HVGO using
hydrogen to produce a mixture of products rich in middle distillates.
As HVGO is a heavy feed similar to vegetable oils, it has been investi-
gated as a possible feedstock for co-hydroprocessing in blends with
canola oil and sunflower oil both in hydrocracking [30, 38] and cata-
lytic cracking (FCC) [50]. From the above research, it is obvious that
there are numerous fossil-based feedstocks that could be used in
blends with bio-based feeds for hybrid fuel production as shown in
Table 1.

Vacuum gas oil (VGO) is the most widespread feedstock for FCC
processes. It is the top product from the vacuum distillation of the
atmospheric residue. It mainly consists of paraffins, naphthenes and
aromatics and has a boiling range of 280(cid:1)580 °C. VGO contains sul-
fur and nitrogen compounds which can act as catalyst poisons [51].
VGO is the most common petroleum distillate which is used in stud-
ies on the FCC co-processing in blends with different lignocellulosic
[52(cid:1)60] and triglycerides-based feedstocks [61, 62]. Sometimes
VGO is subjected to hydrotreatment prior to its co-processing in FCC
units to decrease the content of sulfur and nitrogen which could
influence catalyst deactivation [51, 63(cid:1)66]. It is worth noting that
the properties of VGO (density, viscosity, boiling point range, etc.)
may vary in different studies. For example, it is suggested that the
usual feedstocks used in Brazil are heavier than those used in the
USA or Europe [53].

2.2. Lipids

Triglycerides present in vegetable oils, waste oils or animal fats
are characterized as a suitable raw material for high quality fuels
production. The most common edible oils for co-hydroprocessing
that have been examined in the literature are, palm oil [36], rape-
seed oil [34, 35], soybean oil [36], sunflower oil [29(cid:1)32], while Jatro-
pha oil [33] is the most common non-edible oil studied as a co-
hydroprocessing feedstock. As far as residual feedstocks are con-
cerned, several types have been studied such as used cooking oils/
waste cooking oils (WCO) [42, 46], waste soya oil [72], waste

vegetable oils [48] and animal grease [4, 41]. Here, we provide a brief
overview of different lipid-based feedstocks that can be used for co-
hydroprocessing in existing refineries. Their properties are summa-
rized in Table 2.

2.2.1. Edible oils

Although edible oils are traditionally used for the 1st generation
biodiesel production (FAME), they can also be used for co-hydropro-
cessing with petroleum fractions for hybrid fuel production.

The co-hydroprocessing of different edible oils with petroleum
fractions has been widely explored by many researchers in recent
years. Rapeseed oil was examined as a possible bio-based feedstock
for co-hydroprocessing with light atmospheric gas oil (LAGO). More
specifically, Walendziewski et al. [34] examined 10 wt% and 20 wt%
blends of rape oil with LAGO and noticed the possibility to control
rapeseed oil hydrogenolysis in the presence of gas oil by proper pro-
cess parameters. Mikulec et al. [35] also investigated the co-hydro-
processing of rapeseed oil in 5(cid:1)6 vol% with LAGO for hybrid fuel
production. Hancsok et al. [69] examined the co-hydroprocessing of
rapeseed oil with SRGO at variable blends (0%, 5%, 8%, 12%, 50% and
100% rapeseed oil). Sunflower oil was also examined as a possible
biomass feedstock for co-hydroprocessing with petroleum fractions
such as LAGO [29, 31], HVGO [30] and kerosene [67] in a variety of
blending ratios (95/5, 85/15, 75/25, 30/70 petroleum fraction/sun-
flower oil) for diesel and jet fuel production. Chen et al. [38] have
studied the co-hydroprocessing of low-grade raw canola oil with
HVGO under typical hydroprocessing conditions; it was found that
during co-hydroprocessing, more diesel but less gasoline was pro-
duced in comparison to pure HVGO. Finally, Watkins et al. [36] ana-
lyzed soybean, palm and rapeseed oil to better understand the
possible chemistry that would occur if they were processed in a con-
ventional hydrotreater with SRGO at blending ratios from 10% to
80%. Although there are also other types of edible oils that could be
good candidates for co-hydroprocessing from a technological point
of view, there is a lack of literature due to the “food versus fuel”
debate for edible oils that limits the prospects of their wide-spread
use.

2.2.2. Non-edible oils

The “food versus fuel” debate that stigmatized edible oils acceler-
ated the emergence of non-edible oils as a preferable alternative.
Non-edible oil plants such as Jatropha, sea mango or rubber tree are
well adapted to arid/semi-arid conditions and require low fertility
and moisture demand to grow [73]. In addition, fatty acids and oils
can also be recovered during wood pulping rendering the so-called
tall oils. With respect to their utilization for FAME biodiesel, non-
edible oils can reduce the production cost by 20(cid:1)40% [22]. Similarly,

non-edible oils seem to be a better choice for hybrid fuels production
as they do not raise the price of food production and have been
investigated as suitable candidates. The most famous non-edible oil
is Jatropha. Its co-hydroprocessing with SRGO was investigated in
detail by Satyarthi et al. [33]. Based on studying a wide range of
blending ratios (10(cid:1)50% Jatropha oil blended in SRGO) they showed
that the final products consist of hydrocarbons in the diesel fuel
range. Furthermore, no significant effect on the sulfur content of the
final products was observed and the catalyst performance was found
to be stable after 150 h of operation.

2.2.3. Residual oils

As in the case for non-edible oils, the “food versus fuel” debate
motivated scientists to focus on the 2nd generation of biomass feed-
stocks, which are based on residual biomass only such as used/waste
cooking oil [45], waste animal fats [4, 41], etc. These feedstock sour-
ces have, however, higher amounts of so-called free fatty acids and
water in comparison with edible and non-edible oils and may, thus,
need pre-treatment before processing.

Waste cooking oil (WCO) is a feedstock which can be used in the
production of hybrid biofuels through several methodologies and is
available in satisfactory quantities. Today, used cooking oil is the
main residual feedstock that is increasingly being exploited world-
wide. Based on Wiltsee [74], 4(cid:1)5 kg per capita per year of WCO can
be collected, which when applied to the ca. 500 million inhabitants
of the EU28, corresponds to 2(cid:1)2.5 million metric tons per year of
WCO. Other similar studies in Europe have shown even more opti-
mistic results, such as that in the UK (United Kingdom) alone, there
is the potential of 1 million metric tons of WCO that can be collected
or 16 kg per capita [75], which when extrapolated to the EU28 popu-
lation corresponds to 8 million metric tons per year of WCO. Further-
more, in the EU28, approximately 2.5 million metric tons of fats from
the rendering industry are produced which can be exploited simi-
larly. Specifically, waste animal fats are characterized by low sulfur,
nitrogen and oxygen content (see Table 2) and low TAN approxi-
mately 0.85 mg KOH g¡1 [4, 41].

Although waste oils are residual feedstocks with a very low cost,
one of their main disadvantages however is the large-scale collec-
tion, which has not been solved yet. Other relatively high amounts
of residual triglyceride feedstocks that can be used for co-hydropro-
cessing are formed in a variety rendering facilities. In these plants,
various fatty materials, meal, fodders are made from the waste of
slaughterhouses and carcasses of livestock. The most abundant
product of these rendering plants is the technical grade brown lard,
which is characterized by a high water content of approximately
4400 mg/kg [37] and high TAN (»16.5 mg KOH g¡1). Baladincz and
Hancsok have examined a two stage co-hydroprocessing of waste

animal fats with heavy gas oil fraction for second-generation paraf-
finic biofuels [37, 41]. Another residual feedstock is free fatty acids.
The hydrotreatment of fatty acids blended in gas oil fractions and
the quality of the resulting hydrotreated products from the point of
view of diesel fuel standard requirements were investigated in a
couple of papers [76, 77].

2.2.4. Lipid content

During the co-hydroprocessing of bio-based feedstocks with
petroleum fractions, the bio-content plays an important role with
respect to final product yields and the quality as well as to the
hydrogen consumption, as shown in Table 3 where different blend-
ing ratios of co-hydroprocessing are compared. Toth et al. [29] men-
tioned that a higher vegetable oil content in the feed causes a lower
yield of the organic liquid products. This statement can be explained
by the hypothesis that the liquid product yield of gas oil hydropro-
cessing is higher than the yield of hydroprocessing of neat lipids.
While yields of liquid hydrocarbons > 95% are achieved when hydro-
treating SRGO, the hydroprocessing of lipids produces only 80(cid:1)90%
of liquid hydrocarbons, the remainder being propane (5%), water
and CO, CO2 and CH4. Furthermore, in another study of the same
authors investigating waste cooking oil and FCC light cycle oil blends
(10(cid:1)15%), they concluded that increasing the triglyceride content of
feedstocks above 15% is not recommended, as the sulfur removal
reactions are suppressed due to the high oxygen content [42].
Similar results have also been reported for the co-processing of
SRGO, LCO and animal fats, where the yields of the liquid hydro-
carbon products decreased with the increase in the fat bio-con-
tent of the feedstock [4, 41]. Hancsok et al. [69] found that the
yield of the middle distillate fraction (target fraction) decreased
linearly with the increasing amount of vegetable oil in the feed-
stock because the theoretical yields of paraffin mixtures obtained
triglycerides can only be 81(cid:1)86 wt%
by deoxygenation of
depending on the extent of the key reactions (i.e., hydrodeoxyge-
nation and decarboxylation).

On the other hand, Rana et al. [48] mentioned that an increase of
waste oils content in the feed leads to higher product yields. Rana
et al. [48] after studying hybrid fuel production via the co-hydropro-
cessing of waste vegetable oil and LAGO reported that the final prod-
uct consisted mostly of diesel-range hydrocarbons (60(cid:1)90% yields)
and a small amount of kerosene range-hydrocarbons (10(cid:1)35%
yields). According to Chen et al. [38], during the co-hydroprocessing
of canola oil with heavy vacuum gas oil (blending ratio 95/5, 90/10
and 80/20) the gasoline yields range from 1.2 wt% to 8.6 wt% while

for diesel it ranges from 27 wt% to 38 wt%. Bezergianni et al. [45, 46,
49] who examined waste cooking oil from restaurants and house-
holds as a potential residual bio-feedstock for hybrid fuels with
heavy atmospheric gas oil in a variety of blends (10(cid:1)30%) found that
the optimum blending ratio according to the hydrogen consumption
is up to 10% WCO as the H2 consumption increased by 7% only as
shown in Fig. 3. Besides WCO, waste soya oil with gas oil was also
examined by Tiwari et al. [72] who found that blends can be easily
deoxygenated into hydrocarbons under hydroprocessing conditions
using laboratory prepared hydroprocessing catalysts supported on
mesoporous silica and silica(cid:1)alumina.

2.3. Pyrolysis bio-oils

In addition to lipids, bio-oils have been recently considered as a
promising alternative bio-based feedstock due to the favorable ori-
gin from a non-food biomass. In general, bio-oils can be obtained by
fast heating of a solid biomass, typically a lignocellulosic biomass
including wood, forestry and agricultural residues, to temperatures
around 400(cid:1)500 °C in the absence of oxygen (fast or flash pyrolysis),
a liquid oil with yields up to 70(cid:1)80 wt% is produced [82, 83]. This
fast pyrolysis oil (FPO) is a free-flowing liquid at room temperature
which is green, brown or black in color, depending upon the chemi-
cal composition and the amount of microcarbon content [84]. It
approximates to a biomass in an elemental composition and consists

during the decomposition of lignin and (hemi-)cellulose with an
appreciable proportion of water from both the original moisture and
reaction product [84]. Solid char (5(cid:1)10 wt%) and gas (20(cid:1)30 wt%)
are also produced. Lower process temperatures and longer vapor
residence times favor the production of charcoal. High temperatures
and longer residence times increase the biomass conversion to gas,
while moderate temperatures and a short vapor residence time are
optimum for producing liquids. After cooling and condensation, a
dark brown homogenous liquid is formed which has a heating value
of about half that of a conventional fuel oil. A high yield of liquid is
obtained with most biomass feeds low in ash. FPO has, however, a
low energy density, and low thermal and chemical stability due to
the high oxygen and unsaturation degree [82, 85]. The presence of
oxygenates and unsaturated compounds as well as the admixtures
of basic elements which can behave as catalysts result in the occur-
rence of secondary reactions, such as polymerization, condensation,
[82, 86]. Consequently, density increases while volatility
etc.
decreases under FPO storage.

The complex composition of bio-oils and their physical-chemical
properties together with their instability under storage prevent the
direct blending of bio-oils with petroleum fractions. While blending
is a prerequisite for the successful co-processing by hydrotreating,
FCC can be theoretically accomplished without blending the bio-oil
with a petroleum fraction. To allow blending, the high polarity of the
bio-oil accompanied by its high content of water need to be reduced.
Nonetheless, it is not necessary to remove oxygen completely for
the successful blending as blends, e.g., with triglycerides containing
up to 12 wt% are feasible, i.e., the reduction of the polarity is neces-
sary to make blending possible. Two different upgrading routes are
generally considered for improving bio-oil properties before its co-
processing with hydrotreating or FCC feedstocks.

First, the low quality of FPO can be improved by introducing a
post-pyrolysis mild hydro-treating step to produce an upgraded
hydrodeoxygenated pyrolysis oil (HPO), which is more stable and
possesses higher energy density than the starting bio-oil, FPO [82,
87, 88]. Among the large variety of catalysts employed for bio-oil
HDO, good results have been achieved with noble and base metals
supported on carbon and zeolitic materials [89]. Although these cat-
alysts can be very effective for strongly reducing the oxygen content
of the bio-oil, the high hydrogen consumption and pressure can
increase the costs of HPO production. Elliot [90] pointed out impor-
tant challenges in this field, such as the verification of the long-term
operability of precious metal catalysts in continuous flow systems,
the understanding of the effect of sulfur-containing compounds
present in the bio-oils and the utilization of the upgraded bio-oil as
a feedstock for the production of finished fuels.

Second, the quality of the bio-oil can be improved by performing
an ordinary fast pyrolysis of the biomass in the presence of catalysts,
mostly an FCC catalyst [91, 92]. The addition of catalysts to the

pyrolysis system enhances the desired reactions that include crack-
ing, decarbonylation, decarboxylation, hydrocracking, hydrodeoxy-
genation, and hydrogenation [93]. Additionally, metals present in
the original biomass (Na, K, Mg, Ca) can be accumulated during
pyrolysis on the catalyst surface, create additional basic active sites
and, hence, cause the deterioration of the catalyst performance [94].
When a proper catalyst and conditions are used, the resulting bio-oil
after catalytic pyrolysis (CPO) has a lower oxygen content and is
more stable than the bio-oil from fast pyrolysis (FPO). This is
achieved at the expense of the liquid yield [54]. Nevertheless,
although the presence of a catalyst can change the quality and yield
of the bio-oil produced from a catalytic pyrolysis process, the FCC
catalyst is a very active one producing mainly water and coke. Thus,
it does not seem to be an appropriate catalyst for this application
and other zeolitic materials have been considered for this applica-
tion. According to Fermoso et al. [89], the best results in CPO produc-
tion were obtained over a ZSM-5 zeolite due to its high selectivity
toward the formation of aromatic hydrocarbons. However, this cata-
lyst suffers from a strong deactivation due to the formation of carbo-
naceous deposits as well as excessive decarbonylation reactions.
This implies a significant loss of both carbon and chemical energy
that would otherwise be in the organic liquid products. No doubt,
more research is needed to identify a more suitable catalyst for the
suggested catalytic pyrolysis process to maximize the liquid yield
[95] and, at the same time, to improve its properties.

The characteristics of FPO, HPO and CPO which have been used in
the co-processing with fossil feedstocks, typically in FCC, are sum-
marized in Table 4 using different literature sources.

The data in Table 4 shows that the elemental composition and
physical-chemical characteristics of the bio-oils are greatly affected
by their origin and pre-treatment. In general, a reduction in the dry
bio-oil yield, water amount and density of the FPO is achieved by its
hydrotreatment. As a consequence, both hydrogen and carbon con-
tent increase in the HPO at the expense of the oxygen content.
Simultaneously, a slight increase in its heating value is observed.
The addition of a catalyst to the thermal pyrolysis process results in
a lower yield (about 2£) of bio-oil organic compounds (CPO). The
lower oil yields stem from oxygen removal in the form of water, CO2
and CO, coke formation on the catalyst and an increase in hydrocar-
bon gas yield. Nevertheless, a comparison of the elemental composi-
tion of FPO and CPO shows that the hydrogen content in the
differently prepared bio-oils is very similar.

More importantly, Table 4 also evidences a large variation in the
characteristics of bio-oils prepared by the same method. In particu-
lar, water content in the FPO may vary from 15% to 62%. Accordingly,
the elemental composition of the resulting bio-oil also varies in a
wide range: the oxygen and carbon content changes from 25% to
61% and from 29% to 65%, respectively [59, 96]. The content of sulfur
and nitrogen in the FPO also falls in a wide range of 0.01(cid:1)0.4% [59,

hydrotreating of FPO at T = 300 °C both the sulfur and nitrogen con-
tent in the resulting HPO may remain at a high level of 0.1% and
4.9%, respectively [52]. In most cases, a similar starting biological
material was used for the preparation of the bio-oils, such as pine
wood [53, 55, 57, 60] or poplar [59, 97]. Consequently, the character-
istics of the bio-oils used for co-processing with petroleum feeds
depend not only on the method of their preparation (e.g., fast pyroly-
sis, catalytic pyrolysis or pyrolysis followed by deoxygenation) or on
the origin of the starting biological materials used for bio-oil produc-
tion, but also on other factors, including the conditions of the pyroly-
sis process, the pyrolysis technology used, the use of a catalyst (in
the case of a CPO) or the conditions for the separation of aqueous
and organic components after completing the pyrolysis procedure.
Indeed, Gueudr(cid:3)e et al. [57] pointed out that the composition of the
co-processed pyrolytic oils strongly depends on the various upgrad-
ing steps implemented after the initial pyrolysis of the biomass feed-
stock. Comparing the characteristics of bio-oils from different
studies, Agblevor et al. [96] made a conclusion that the CPO from
their study might be similar to those from the partially hydroge-
nated bio-oils from [82] with respect to the O/C ratios.

3. Co-processing in hydroprocessing units

3.1. Hydroprocessing technology

Hydroprocessing is a catalytic process that enables targeted cata-
lytic reactions with the addition of hydrogen. The aim of hydropro-
cessing is to increase the hydrogen-to-carbon ratio and to almost
completely remove undesirable heteroatoms such as sulfur, nitro-
gen, oxygen and some metals. Furthermore, in some cases, hydro-
processing also targets to the reduction of olefin and the aromatic
content of the feedstock. The key reactions involved in hydropro-
cessing include hydrodesulphurization (HDS), hydrodenitrogenation
(HDN), hydrodemetallization (HDM), hydrogenation (HYD) and
hydrodeoxygenation (HDO). HDS and HDN enable sulfur and nitro-
gen removal respectively [100], both of which are environmentally
driven, aiming to mitigate SOX and NOX emissions of fuel combus-
tion. HDM reactions focus on the removal of the present metals that
severely poison the conversion catalysts during downstream refin-
ery processes. HYD reactions favor the saturation of feedstocks and
the reduction of aromatics, when required, and they are also a

perquisite for further conversion reactions such as hydrocracking.
HDO reactions are necessary for the removal of oxygen compounds,
which are not desired in certain refinery products such as kerosene.
HDO reactions are particularly important for bio-based feedstocks
some of which might contain as much as 50 wt% oxygen. For this
reason, HDO reactions are of high importance during the hydropro-
cessing or co-hydroprocessing of bio-based feedstocks.

In general, catalytic hydroprocessing is widely employed in all
refineries worldwide to upgrade fossil-based intermediate streams.
Each hydroprocessing plant within a refinery focuses on a single or a
combination of the aforementioned reactions depending on the
application, rendering multiple hydroprocessing plants within a sin-
gle refinery. The availability and flexibility of the underlying refinery
hydroprocessing plants render this process a suitable candidate for
the parallel conversion of bio-based feedstocks/intermediates within
a refinery. Furthermore, in many cases some refinery streams are of
such low quality (e.g., having high polyaromatic and sulfur contents)
that their individual upgrading to fuels is not profitable, such as the
light cycle oil (LCO) formed in an FCC plant which is being co-hydro-
processed with SRGO [42]. In such cases, co-hydroprocessing with
liquid bio-based feedstocks and/or intermediates may better justify
their upgrading, while in some cases even improve the exploitation
potential of such low-quality refinery streams. All the targeted
hybrid fuels produced via co-hydroprocessing of bio-based with
petroleum streams can fulfill the high-bio-content-fuels require-
ments of the relevant directives of the European Union as described
in the introduction section, by utilizing existing infrastructures.

In general, there are two pathways during biomass hydroprocess-
ing, the first one is hydrodeoxygenation in which 1 triglyceride mol-
ecule consumes 12 hydrogen molecules
to form 3 normal
hydrocarbons with an even number of carbon atoms in their mole-
cules, e.g., n-octadecane (n-C18H38), and the second one is hydrode-
carboxylation in which 1 triglyceride molecule consumes 3
hydrogen molecules to form 3 normal hydrocarbons with an odd
number of carbon atoms in their molecules, e.g., n-heptadecane (n-
C17H36) as they are depicted in Fig. 4 [38]. Typically, the main prod-
ucts for hydrogenation of triglycerides are hydrocarbons (n-alkanes)
and by-products are propane, water, CO and CO2 [101]. A byproduct
is a product with lower economic value than the main product.

During the co-hydroprocessing of bio-based feedstocks with fos-
sil feeds, the products consist of a gas phase, a water phase and an
organic liquid phase [29] as schematically represented in Fig. 5. The

Fig. 4. Pathways of hydroprocessing triglycerides [38].

yields of the final products, as the liquid organic product yields
decrease with increasing pressure and temperature in the case of
gas oil and vegetable oil blends [29]. On the other hand, according to
Sankaranarayanan et al. [31] an increase in pressure (30(cid:1)60 bars)
increased the conversion of vegetable oil in the blend (20% vegetable
oil) by up to 15% depending on the catalyst (> 96% conversion was
achieved) (see Fig. 6), as the conversion of the vegetable oil occurs
through hydrocracking and hydrogenolysis reactions that consume
hydrogen. Eller et al. [67] noticed that the extent of the aromatic sat-
uration increased with the increasing pressure during jet fuel pro-
duction. Furthermore, during the co-hydroprocessing of SRGO, LCO
and waste animal fats, an increase in pressure (from 40 to 70 bars)
promoted the conversion of triglycerides resulting in higher yields
(from 92% to 94%) of the organic liquid product [4]. Similar results
were also observed by Sagi et al. [76] who found that a higher pres-
sure is advantageous for HDO and HDS reactions, while higher pres-
sures also allowed products with ultra-low sulphur content, even at
an increased LHSV, to be obtained. Moreover, in the case of the two-
stage co-hydroprocessing of waste lard (10% blend) with HAGO, at
temperatures above 320 °C an increase in pressure (from 20 to
80 bars) caused a small reduction in organic liquid product yields by
2% due to hydrocracking reactions [37].

Reaction temperature: Most hydrotreatment units operate at a
temperature range from 290 to 400 °C. Toth et al. [29] mentioned
that during the co-hydroprocessing of vegetable oil with a SRGO at
80 bars and 3 h¡1 LHSV (Liquid Hourly Space Velocity), the increase
in temperature (from 300 to 380 °C) increased the conversion and
yields of the organic liquid product from 86% to 92% [29]. Similar
results were also observed by Chen et al. [38] during the co-hydro-
processing of canola oil with HVGO, the yield of the organic liquid
products and feed conversion increased with the increase in temper-
ature from 360 to 395 °C. It was noticed that 80/20 HVGO/canola oil
feed had the highest conversion while pure HVGO had the lowest
one. They concluded that canola oil was easier to crack than HVGO.
Consequently, to achieve the same organic product content or con-
version, feeds with canola oil content required lower reaction tem-
peratures than pure HVGO. As a result, the higher the canola oil
concentration in the feed, the lower the reaction temperature that is
required. Bezergianni and Dimitriadis [105] mentioned that a higher
temperature favored heteroatom removal without affecting conver-
sion; however, the addition of WCO favored the conversion of the
organic liquid product without affecting sulfur and nitrogen
removal. Eller et al. [67] reported that the optimum temperature
range during the co-hydroproccesing of kerosene with sunflower oil
for jet fuel production is 320(cid:1)330 °C. In the case of co-hydroprocess-
ing straight run gas oil, LCO and animal fats, the yields of the organic
liquid product increased until a temperature of 340 °C and then
decreased with a further increase in temperature, which was due to
hydrocracking reactions that take place parallel to the hydrogena-
tion and aromatic ring opening reactions [4, 41]. Similar trends were
also observed during the two-stage co-hydroprocessing of waste
lard with heavy gas oil, the yield of the main hydrogenated product
fraction slightly decreased with an increase in temperature [37].

In conclusion, the discussed studies show that temperatures
higher than 340 °C favor conversion as well as organic liquid yields
during the co-processing of vegetable oils with petroleum fractions.
However, the results are different when animal fats are co-processed
with petroleum fractions. In this case, mid-range temperatures
(320(cid:1)340 °C) favor conversion, but with a further increase in tem-
perature, the yields of the main liquid product decrease due to
hydrocracking reactions that take place in addition to hydrogenation
and saturation. A general conclusion that can be drawn is that when
vegetable oils are co-processed with petroleum fractions, higher
temperatures (360(cid:1)390 °C) are preferable, on the other hand when
fats, mid-range temperatures
the biomass consists of animal
(320(cid:1)340 °C) are optimal.

desired organic phase product is a liquid product containing hydro-
carbons, some unreacted oxygen compounds [81] and a small
amount of dissolved water. Depending on the bio- and fossil-based
feedstocks co-hydroprocessed, the organic phase consists of three
different fractions: a) a light product (hydrocarbons of a boiling
point range of 0¡180 °C), b) a mid-distillate product (a boiling point
from 180 to 360 °C), and c) a heavy residue (with a boiling point
over 360 °C). The aqueous phase is formed during the hydrodeoxyge-
nation (HDO) and decarbonylation reactions of the bio-based part of
the feedstock, and can be separated from the desired organic phase
via sedimentation. Finally, the gas phase, besides the excess of
hydrogen, also contains methane, carbon monoxide and carbon
dioxide, which are by-products of the deoxygenation reactions
(hydrodeoxygenation, decarbonylation, decarboxylation), propane
formed from the triglyceride molecules cleavage, hydrogen sulfide
and ammonia produced from the HDS and HDN reactions of the fos-
sil part of the feedstock, and a small amount of light hydrocarbon
by-products (C1(cid:1)C4) formed during cracking reactions.

The yields and properties of the organic liquid phase depend on
the operating conditions of the process, the type of catalyst as well
as the feedstock (the type of bio-and fossil-based feedstock and bio-
content). In principle, the more severe the process parameters and
the higher the feedstock bio-content, the lower the density of the
organic phase product [34]. In the next section, the effect of the co-
hydroprocessing operating parameters is summarized based on the
available literature.

3.2. Operating parameters

3.2.1. Co-hydroprocessing of lipids with fossil fractions

The most important factors of hydroprocessing are the operating
conditions, i.e., reaction pressure, reaction temperature, space veloc-
ity and hydrogen-to-oil ratio, and catalyst. Table 5 presents different
studies that have been carried out in co-hydroprocessing at various
operating conditions.

Reaction pressure: Hydrogen pressures during co-processing
range from 20 bars to 110 bars (Table 5), affecting the HDS reactions
as well as product yields. High hydrogen pressures are necessary for
the hydrogen demanding reactions and its role is to increase the
availability of hydrogen in the liquid phase. Special attention should
be paid when co-processing feedstocks, such as lipids that have a
high concentration of olefinic bonds, as saturation reactions con-
sume large amounts of hydrogen. Changes in pressure affect the
extent of the major (hydrodeoxygenation, decarboxylation and
decarbonylation) and secondary reactions (strongly exothermic
methanation and endothermic reverse water-gas-shift reaction), i.e.,
the selectivity is influenced. The reaction pressure also affects the

Space velocity: A key parameter of hydroprocessing is space
velocity, which is defined either in terms of WHSV (weight hourly
space velocity) or LHSV (liquid hourly space velocity). WHSV is
defined as the mass feed flow-rate per dry catalyst mass loaded in
the reactor. LHSV is defined as the feed volume flow-rate per catalyst
volume inside the reactor. The inverse of the space velocity is the
contact (residence) time, i.e., it provides information for how long
the feed is in contact with the catalyst under the operating condi-
tions. The space velocity applied in the hydrotreating processes
ranges from 1 to 4 h¡1. Rana et al. [48] examined the co-hydropro-
cessing of waste vegetable oil (from soya oil) with SRGO, and deter-
mined that by increasing the space velocity, it is possible to increase
the yield of middle distillate hydrocarbons (C15(cid:1)C18) with negligible
cracking. Furthermore, Dimitriadis and Bezergianni [47] reported
that lower LHSVs favor saturation reactions (thus increasing hydro-
gen consumption) while heteroatom removal, conversion and diesel
yield are unaffected. Hence, higher LHSV is considered more suitable
for co-hydroprocessing of HAGO/WCO [47]. According to Sagi et al.
[4, 76], a reduction of LHSV was favorable for the improvement in
the conversion at lower reaction temperatures; however, as the pro-
longed residence time favors the formation of lighter compounds by
cracking. During the two-stage co-hydroprocessing experiments,
Baladincz and Hancsok [37] observed that the triglyceride conver-
sion is favored by a decrease in LHSV, however, the hydrocracking
activity of the catalyst is increased as well, lowering the liquid
organic product yield. Similar results were also found by Toth et al.
[29] who noticed an increase in organic liquid yields with a decrease
in WHSV. A general conclusion is that the optimum LHSV for co-
hydroprocessing in the reaction temperature range of 320 to 360 °C
varies from 1 to 2 h¡1.

Hydrogen-to-oil ratio: In principle, increasing the hydrogen flow-
rate improves the HDS effectiveness since HDS is proportional to the
partial pressure of hydrogen. In addition, when having a constant
feed flow-rate, increasing the hydrogen flow-rate contributes to the
vaporization of a large amount of the feed. Satyarthi et al. [33]
claimed that by increasing hydrogen flow, the desulfurization activ-
ity is better in the co-hydroprocessing of Jatropha oil with straight
run gas oil, and estimated that up to 30 wt% Jatropha oil can be proc-
essed without affecting the final sulfur content of the product. Simi-
lar results were also obtained by Dimitriadis and Bezergianni [47] in
the co-hydroprocessing of waste cooking oil with heavy atmospheric
gas oil. They showed that a higher H2/liquid feed ratio favors satura-
tion and heteroatom removal as there is an excess of hydrogen for
the reactions to take place as shown in Fig. 7. In general, hydropro-
cessing is a technology that consumes hydrogen, the addition of a
biomass feedstock in the co-hydroprocessing increases the hydrogen
consumption of the overall process rather substantially. The amount
of additional hydrogen consumed is obviously dependent on the
type of feedstock, i.e., bio-oil or lipids (saturated or unsaturated) and
the reaction path that is related to the mechanism and kinetics
of the process [101]. A very important parameter that affects the
hydrogen consumption is the degree of saturation of the initial
feedstock, more specifically palm oil and animal fats are highly
saturated feeds and offer the advantage of lower hydrogen con-
sumption when the target is renewable diesel. Other lipid feeds
that contain high amounts of unsaturated fatty acids (27(cid:1)40%
C18:3) are camelina oil, linseed oil and algae oil which are pref-
erable for aviation renewable fuels [106], plausibly because of
the cyclization of the unsaturated chains producing substituted
the most
naphthenic hydrocarbons. According to literature,

3.2.2. Co-hydroprocessing of bio-oils with fossil fractions

The key aspect of any prospective refinery co-processing is the
influence of the added feedstock, i.e., bio-oil or pre-hydrotreated
bio-oil, on the base petroleum feedstock, i.e., straight-run gas oil or
vacuum gas oil. Apart from the immiscibility issues that will have a
plausibly more severe impact on upgrading in the liquid phase pro-
cesses over catalysts in a fixed bed (hydrotreating / hydrocracking)
than on the gas phase cracking over a fluidized catalyst bed (FCC),
the chemical inhibition effects are of importance as well. In this con-
text, the hydrotreating of atmospheric gas oil would be the most
sensitive process as it affords a final refinery product, i.e., diesel that
is limited by strict standards. For instance, any inhibition by the
oxygenates will limit the hydrodesulphurization activity and, thus,
render reaching the 10 ppm S limit very challenging.

Up to now, there is only limited information on the co-processing
of bio-oil or pre-hydrotreated bio-oil in the open literature. More
specifically, there is just one study that examines the direct co-proc-
essing of a real bio-oil with petroleum fractions (straight run gas oil)
[68]. Pinheiro et al. [68] studied the co-hydrotreatment of a bio-oil
(produced from hardwood) with SRGO. In order to achieve this goal,
the bio-oil was separated into four fractions by membrane fraction-
ation and one of the fractions was mixed with the SRGO and co-
hydrotreated over a CoMo/Al2O3 catalyst at 330 °C, 5 MPa, 1 h¡1
(LHSV) and 400 SL/L H2/HCoutlet. An inhibition effect on the HDS,
HDN and HDCa (aromatic hydrogenation) reactions was observed in
the presence of the bio-oil fraction. This inhibition was due to the
presence of CO and CO2 formed during the reaction and not due to
the oxygen compounds present in the bio-oil itself [68]. The very
few studies that exist [103, 107, 108] mostly examine model com-
pounds such as guaiacol with atmospheric gas oil to simulate the
effect of a bio-oil in an existing petroleum refinery.

(HDN)

(HDS),

Several of these studies investigate the effect of bio-oil-represen-
tative compounds on the hydrotreating performance, i.e., hydro-
desulphurization
and
hydrodearomatization (HDA), over commercial hydrotreating cata-
lysts [102, 103, 108(cid:1)110]. Under standard hydrotreating conditions,
i.e., at > 330 °C, > 3 MPa and 1 h¡1, typical oxygenates covering the
variety of functionalities present in bio-oils, such as anisole, guaia-
col, 2-propanol, cyclopentanone, propionic acid and ethyl decanoate,
have been completely deoxygenated when co-processed with
straight-run gas oil (SRGO) over a commercial CoMo catalyst [103].
The concentration of these oxygenates in the SRGO was in the range
1.0(cid:1)4.0 wt%. The results indicate that oxygenates rendering only
water as a deoxygenation by-product do not inhibit the HDS, HDN
and HDA performance of the catalyst, whereas a strong inhibition of

the HDS, HDN and HDA activity was found in the case of propionic
acid and ethyl decanoate [103]. It was shown that the inhibition is
not due to the oxygenates themselves, but rather due to the inhibit-
ing effect of CO and CO2, i.e., the by-products of deoxygenation
[108]. The formation of carbon oxides is a consequence of the decar-
boxylation and / or decarbonylation reactions. Under hydrotreating
conditions, it is virtually impossible to distinguish these pathways
due to the rapid establishment of equilibrium between CO and CO2
by the water-gas-shift and the reversed water-gas-shift reactions
[108]. The inhibition effect of the addition of 1.16 wt% propionic acid
or of 3.13 wt% ethyl decanoate in the SRGO could be expressed in
technological terms as a need for an increase in the co-processing
temperature by 11 °C to achieve the same level of desulfurization as
in the case of SRGO. In the case of HDN, the necessary temperature
increment would be 16 or 18 °C, respectively, while in the case of
HDA, the co-processing temperature would need to be increased by
6 or 5 °C, respectively, in comparison with SRGO hydrotreating to
have the same content of aromatics in all reaction effluents [103].

Among the other studied oxygenates, anisole and guaiacol,
deserve particular attention. Though they are completely deoxygen-
ated under the experimental conditions, the yield of the products, i.
e., cyclohexane and benzene, were much lower than expected. Only
10.7 and 17.0 mol% of cyclohexane and benzene (< 0.5 mol%) were
formed in the co-processing of anisole and guaiacol, respectively,
with SRGO [103]. This indicates that these aromatic oxygenates
probably undergo, at standard hydrotreating conditions, condensa-
tion reactions yielding compounds undistinguishable from hydro-
carbons present in the SRGO [103]. Under their experimental
conditions, the authors [103] have ruled out the possibility of exces-
sive coke formation that was proposed by others [100, 110] for
guaiacol deoxygenation. It has to be noted that these studies were
performed on oxygenates dissolved in hexadecane in a batch reactor
at temperatures 260¡300 °C. Consequently, the conversion of guaia-
col was limited to 60% and phenolics (phenol and catechol) were the
only reaction products,
i.e., only partial deoxygenation through
demethoxylation took place [110]. In agreement with Pinheiro et al.
[103], Bui et al. [108] has reported the absence of an HDS inhibition
when co-processing guaiacol (5000 ppm) with SRGO over a commer-
cial CoMo catalyst at temperatures above 320 °C and at an LHSV of
1 h¡1. However, they have observed the inhibition of the HDS activ-
ity outside the typical range of hydrotreating conditions, namely at
300 °C and 2 h¡1, i.e., at shorter contact times. With a reference to
older studies focusing on the upgrading/co-processing of coal
liquids, they explain the inhibition of the HDS activity by competi-
tive adsorption of between phenols originating from guaiacol and
sulfur-containing compounds, such as benzo- and dibenzothio-
phenes [108]. In quantitative terms, the addition of 5000 ppm of
guaiacol led to a decrease in the HDS conversion to ca. 30% from

about 70% established for SRGO at 300 °C. At 340 °C, the HDS conver-
sion decreased from ca. 92% (SRGO) to approximately 88% when
5000 ppm guaiacol was added to the SRGO [108].

bulkier and to overcome diffusion limitations, large pore-size cata-
lysts, i.e., catalysts with larger mean pore size than normally used in
common hydrotreating catalysts, are required [72].

An inhibition of the HDS activity of a commercial CoMo catalyst
was observed not only for the co-processing of model compounds. It
was also reported by Mercader et al. [107] for the co-processing of
an SRGO with hydrotreated (i.e., partially deoxygenated) bio-oils in
weight ratio 70-to-30. It was observed that the competition between
the HDS and HDO reactions did not result in permanent catalyst
deactivation [107]. The bio-oils were obtained by water addition to
the whole pyrolysis oil resulting in phase separation into organic
and aqueous fractions. It has to be noted that depending on the type,
the hydrotreated bio-oil used in the co-processing was diluted in
isopropanol 2:1 or 1:1 on a weight basis to reduce its viscosity [107].
Hence, it has to be kept in mind that the dilution might have affected
the co-processing in a positive way. Moreover, the experiments have
not been performed under fully typical hydrotreating conditions,
namely at 380 °C and at LHSV of 2 h¡1. Due to the different dilution
of both bio-oils tested, it is difficult to compare the inhibition effect
in a quantitative way (cid:1) the sulfur content increased from 136 ppm
found for SRGO hydrotreating to ca. 2000 ppm for the less diluted
bio-oil and to 376 ppm for the more diluted bio-oil. Interestingly,
deoxygenation of the bio-oil was not complete at these experimental
conditions and phenolics were found in the product [107]. This is in
line with the review of Furimsky [100] showing the carbon-oxygen
bond in phenolics as one of the most refractory bonds in hydrotreat-
ing.

3.3. Catalysts for co-hydroprocessing

The selection of optimum catalysts for the co-hydroprocessing of
bio-based feedstocks with those derived from petroleum is of
utmost importance as it determines not only the product yield and
quality, but also the duration of the co-processing operation, i.e., the
maximum catalyst life expectancy is targeted. The hydrotreating cat-
alyst selection for co-hydroprocessing is a major challenge for two
reasons: a) Catalyst activity varies significantly, as commercial cata-
lysts are optimized for different feedstocks, i.e., feedstocks with high
sulfur concentration or heavy feedstocks (containing large mole-
cules) or feedstocks with high oxygen concentration etc. b) Currently
there are only a few commercial hydrotreatment catalysts available
for bio-based feedstock/intermediate processing [111]. Conse-
quently, the evaluation of different hydrotreating catalysts for the
co-hydroprocessing of biomass feeds with petroleum fractions is a
very important research area. Table 5 presents studies focusing on
the co-hydroprocessing of bio-based feeds with fossil fuels using
various catalysts.

The most common catalysts used in co-hydroprocessing are com-
mon hydrotreating catalysts based on cobalt(cid:1)molybdenum (CoMo)
[29, 45] and nickel(cid:1)molybdenum (NiMo) [45, 48] sulfides. In gen-
eral, CoMo catalysts are the most appropriate for desulfurization,
while they exhibit low activity for the removal of nitrogen and the
saturation of aromatic compounds while NiMo catalysts exhibit
higher activity in nitrogen reduction and the saturation of aromatics,
while they are less efficient for sulfur removal [112, 113].

The use of typical hydroprocessing catalysts for the deoxygen-
ation of triglycerides during co-hydroprocessing raises two impor-
tant issues. Firstly, the high oxygen content of triglycerides can
result in increased continuous sulfur leaching from the catalyst sur-
face and hence its gradual deactivation. Hence, an additional source
of sulfur to replenish it on the surface is needed. However, the pri-
mary reason of the catalyst deactivation is coking which depends
considerably upon the operating parameters as well as the blending
ratio of the initial feed (fossil fraction and bio-based content) [33].
Secondly, compared to petroleum derived feedstocks, triglyceride
molecules, as well as some oligomers present in the bio-oils, are

The co-hydroprocessing of different blends of canola oil with
HVGO over NiMo/gAl2O3 was studied by Chen et al. [38], their
results have shown that no effects were observed on the HDS and
HDN reactions when canola oil was added in the initial fossil feed.
Similar results were also reported by Bezergianni et al. [46] who
compared the efficiency of a commercial NiMo with a commercial
CoMo catalyst on the co-hydroprocessing of the fossil fraction
(heavy atmospheric gas oil) blended with waste cooking oil (WCO).
Their findings have shown that the HDS efficiency of a NiMo-type
catalyst was not affected by the addition of WCO, while the effi-
ciency of the CoMo-type catalyst was severely hindered from 95% of
pure HAGO to 80% for the 70/30 HAGO/WCO blend. The efficiency of
a NiMo-type catalyst during co-hydroprocessing was also studied by
Rana et al. [48] who concluded that the hydrodeoxygenation path-
way becomes more dominant with an increasing soya oil content in
the feed.

During the hydroprocessing of triglyceride feeds, H2O, CO2, CO,
and light alkanes are produced as by products [39, 40]. It is obvious
that these by-products also produced during the co-processing of
bio-based feeds with fossil fractions. As CO2 constitutes one of the
main by-products of co-hydrotreatment reactions, Bezergianni and
Dagonikou [39] investigated the effect of CO2 as a by-product during
the co-hydroprocessing of gas-oil and triglycerides, over a commer-
cial CoMo/Al2O3 catalyst. The aim of the study was to identify the
influence of CO2 on the effectiveness of heteroatom removal and sat-
uration reactions. It was shown that the presence of CO2 limits both
the heteroatom removal (sulfur and nitrogen) and saturation reac-
tions. Similar effects were reported by Pinheiro et al. [114] also.
Bezergianni et al. [40] also examined the influence of H2O and CO in
the potential biomass catalytic co-hydroprocessing with fossil-based
fractions to produce hybrid fuels. It was found that the H2O role is
neutral on the HDS and HDN removal. However, CO has a suspend-
ing role due to the inhibition of the catalyst active sites [40]. The
weak inhibiting effect of H2O on the hydrogenation reactions was
also confirmed by Laurent and Delmon [110].

As it was already mentioned, the NiMo- and CoMo-type catalysts
are the most common catalysts for co-hydroprocessing, however
other types of catalyst have been explored in terms of their effi-
ciency in co-hydroprocessing, such as NiW catalysts [35]. NiW cata-
lysts mostly favor decarboxylation and decarbonylation reactions
during co-hydroprocessing and are more appropriate when increas-
ing triglyceride content in the feed [48], thus the hydrogen con-
sumption is lower when NiW catalysts are used as decarbonylation/
decarboxylation pathways consume less hydrogen compared to
hydrodeoxygenation, which is more favored over NiMo catalysts.
Nevertheless, hydrogen consumption also depends on the system
pressure as well as the successive hydrogenation of CO and CO2,
which was limited in the case of NiW catalysts. To sum up, hydro-
deoxygenation is favored by NiMo while decarboxylation and decar-
bonylation are favored over NiW. Furthermore, different support
materials for NiMo as well as NiW catalyst were also investigated,
such as Al2O3, TiO2, NaY and ZrO2. Nonetheless, in the cases of cata-
lyst support with a low specific surface (ZrO2), the level of desulphu-
rization was much lower when compared to the commercial catalyst
[35].

According to Tiwari et al. [72] the use of a NiW catalyst on an
acidic-alumina also results in lower diesel range hydrocarbons
(250¡380 °C) compared with NiMo/Al2O3 due to more cracking of
hydrocarbons over NiW catalyst due to its higher acidity. Thus, NiW
catalysts are more suitable for the production of kerosene range
products. Similar results were also found by Rana et al. [48] who
reported that diesel yields over NiW catalyst are 2(cid:1)20% lower com-
pared with NiMo.

S. Bezergianni et al. / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 68 (2018) 29(cid:1)64

Also, the effect of a zeolite beta (BEA) content in NiMo catalyst
was investigated. Sankaranarayanan et al. [31] has studied the effi-
ciency of NiMo-BEA-gamma-alumina catalyst on co-hydroprocess-
ing of straight run gas oil with sunflower oil. It was found that the
large amount of zeolite (0(cid:1)30%) in the catalyst helped in cracking
the triglyceride molecules and enhanced the HDS activity of the
NiMo catalyst.

Another approach to co-hydroprocessing is to combine vari-
ous compositions of hydrogenation catalysts in the catalyst bed,
more specifically to use different catalyst layers in the catalyst
bed. This approach was investigated by Toth et al. [29] who used
three commercial transition metal/Al2O3 catalysts with different
compositions. The aim of this approach was to exploit the differ-
ent activity of the three layers (protection/pre-hydrogenation,
hydrodesulphurization/hydrodeoxygenation and isomerization)
resulting in fuel components with slightly better cold flow prop-
erties. Similarly, Albemarle [111] has proposed a so-called Bio-
STAX system that is a solution consisting of several different
commercial catalysts loaded at a specific place in the reactor and
considering the constraints of the unit, such as the H2/oil ratio,
outlet pressure, capacity of quenching, and intended VO addition
(type and amount). The distribution (placement) of the catalysts
in the reactor reflects the main factors affecting the kinetics of
the individual feed components conversion [115].

Two-stage co-hydroprocessing is another approach for biofuel
production. Baladincz and Hancsok [37] examined the possibility of
a two stage co-hydroprocessing of waste lard with heavy gas oil. The
first step, hydrogenation using NiMo/g-Al2O3, was followed by an
isomerization step on a custom-made Pt/SAPO-11 catalyst. After the
first step, the product liquid yields were 95.1(cid:1)95.5%, the triglyceride
part was fully converted and the cetane number ranged from 56 to
58. After the second step (isomerization), the product yields were
91.4(cid:1)92.4% and the cetane number ranged from 54 to 55. The
isomerization step aimed at improving the CFPP properties was suc-
cessful as the CFPP temperatures were between ¡15 to ¡20 °C.

Until now, different catalyst approaches for co-hydroprocessing
of triglycerides with fossil fuels were analyzed, however besides the
product quality, the expected catalyst decay rate is also a very
important factor for determining the suitability of a hydrotreating
catalyst in industry. The catalyst deactivation rate is associated with
the overall refinery planning and has a significant economic impact.
Bezergianni et al. [46] has examined the deactivation rate of a com-
mercial CoMo/g-Al2O3 and a NiMo/g-Al2O3 catalyst during the co-
hydroprocessing of waste cooking oil and heavy atmospheric gas oil
blends. The deactivation rate was evaluated in terms of the loss of
HDS efficiency of each catalyst with the increasing days of the exper-
iment, i.e., days on stream (DOS). Their results have shown that after
26 DOS, the deactivation rate of the NiMo/g-Al2O3 catalyst (20%)
was less significant when compared with the CoMo/g-Al2O3 catalyst
(30%) rendering NiMo as a better choice for lipids containing feed-

tion with a 5% addition of rapeseed oil in a straight run vacuum

As mentioned above, as far as co-hydroprocessing of pyrolysis
bio-oil with petroleum fractions is concerned, there are very few
studies in the literature and most of them use model compounds
to simulate the bio-oil content. The most common model com-
pound is guaiacol. First, it should be noted that hydrotreatment
of a bio-oil in a stand-alone process, faces some disadvantages
that are important for the life of a catalyst. More specifically, the
HDO reaction of 2-methoxyphenol (guaiacol), which was studied
over commercial hydrotreating catalysts such as CoMoS/Al2O3
and NiMoS/Al2O3 [104, 116], has shown that there is a need to
add sulfur to the bio-oil in order to keep the active sites of the

been reported to diminish the activity of NiMo catalyst through
competitive adsorption between H2S and the hydrogenolysis and
hydrogenation sites present on the catalyst surface [109]. The
co-hydroprocessing of bio-oil with fossil-based feeds on the
other hand, is a technology that can eliminate this effect. The
hydrodeoxygenation of guaiacol (HDO) in co-processing with gas
oil (HDS) makes it unnecessary to add external sources of sulfur
as the gas oil already has enough sulfur content [108]: the H2S
produced during the HDS of the gas oil acts as a sulfiding agent
which extends the lifetime of the HDS catalyst.

Pinheiro et al. [68, 114] investigated the co-hydroprocessing of
model compounds as well as of pretreated bio-oil in SRGO (Straight
Run Gas Oil) blends by using CoMo/g-Al2O3. The main conclusion
was that oxygenated model compounds which produce water by
deoxygenation had no impact on the hydrotreatment of the SRGO
under deep HDS conditions whereas inhibition occurs at lower tem-
perature [104]. Sepuvelda et al. [102] claimed that ReS2 supported
over alumina displayed higher activities compared to commercial
reference catalysts, for this reason they investigated the co-hydro-
processing of guaiacol and 4,6-dimethyldibenzothiophene over ReS2
catalysts supported on SiO2 and g-Al2O3. Their results have shown
that guaiacol and 4,6-DMDBT compounds compete for the same
active sites. Thus, guaiacol inhibited the HDS reaction for the
two catalysts which is in agreement with the results observed by
Bui et al. [104] over NiMoS/Al2O3 catalysts. Another observation
was that the HDS efficiency reduced for both catalysts while the
HDO efficiency increased for the ReS2/Al2O3 catalyst only. The
reduction of HDS efficiency was due to the competitive adsorp-
tion between guaiacol and 4,6-dimethyldibenzothiophene on the
active sites while the increase of HDO efficiency was due to the
inhibition of the demethylation pathway beneficial to the deme-
thoxylation route.

Unfortunately, there is a lack of literature in the co-hydropro-
cessing of pyrolysis bio-oil with fossil-based feedstocks. The most
commonly used catalysts up to now are CoMo/Al2O3 and NiMoS/
Al2O3, however, further studies with different types of catalyst
should take place in the future to better understand the effect of the
catalyst type on the extent of the HDO and HDS reactions and to
learn about the stability of these catalysts under co-hydroprocessing
conditions.

Co-processing of bio-based feedstocks, particularly of lipids, has
already reached commercial status. However, it is not easy to collect
specific data about these technologies and their status. For example,
renewable diesel fuel has been produced by ConocoPhillips at its
refinery in Whitegate, Cork, Ireland [9], since 2006, but detailed
information about the real capacity, the content of the lipids, in the
hydrotreated feedstock, is not available [111]. Similarly, Petrobras
[117] has developed a process in which triglycerides (vegetables oils
and/or animal fats) can be co-hydroprocessed with a fossil-based
feedstock at up to 20%. The bio- and fossil-based feedstock is hydro-
processed at 220(cid:1)350 °C, improving the quality of the diesel oil pro-
duced [118]. The plan of Petrobras was to have the process
implemented in at least three of its refineries by the end of 2007.
However, the implementation was put on hold in 2008 due to high
soybean oil prices that should have been the main feedstock [111,
117]. Furthermore, Haldor Topsoe supplies its deoxygenation cata-
lyst to three undisclosed refineries in Australia, Europe, and the USA
co-processing bio-feedstocks in the range of 0(cid:1)5%, 2(cid:1)5%, and
10(cid:1)20%, respectively [111]. The feedstocks typically include animal
fats, for example, chicken fat in the USA, and other unspecified bio-
feedstocks. In Preem, Sweden, Haldor Topsoe has supplied its deox-
ygenation catalyst for the co-processing of raw tall oil (20(cid:1)30% of
the feed). Apart from co-processing, the Haldor Topsoe catalyst is
used by Cetane Energy, USA, to process neat animal fat and algae oil
[111].

4. Co-processing in catalytic cracking units

Catalytic cracking, i.e., FCC, is a versatile workhorse of modern
refineries and holds a potential to upgrade various bio-based feed-
stocks through their cracking and deoxygenation. This section will,
thus, review the results on the co-processing of petroleum fractions
with bio-based feedstocks in catalytic cracking units. In general, the
co-processing of rapeseed oil (RSO) with petroleum oil in FCC condi-
tions seems to be a more advantageous process in comparison with
the transformation of RSO alone due to several reasons. Firstly, there
is a substantial difference between the global consumption of petro-
leum (4.02 billion metric tons per year (BTY)) and the production of
vegetable oils (0.12 BTY) [115]. Due to the lower availability of vege-
table oils, the most preferable option is to integrate them into exist-
ing refining schemes than to create a new production. Secondly, it is
suggested that potential synergy may be gained through co-process-
ing the two different feedstocks, i.e., aromatic (VGO) versus paraffinic
(RSO) [50]. Indeed, in most cases, increased conversion was observed
during FCC processing of blends of RSO with petroleum oil compared
to conventional feedstock alone [50, 119]. From a technological point
of view, the co-processing of vegetable oils with conventional FCC
feeds seems to be a simpler process than the corresponding co-proc-
essing using bio-oil as a co-feed (Sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2). Firstly,
vegetable oils are homogeneous mixtures and mix well with petro-
leum oils, thus eliminating the occurrence of such technological
problems as the separation of the constituents, pipe plugging, etc.
Secondly, seed oils possess high crackability which is derived from
their low thermal stability. Indeed, pure crude palm oil can be suc-
cessively exposed to thermal cracking by means of free radicals in
(cid:1)
Cern(cid:3)y et al. [121] have

shown that canola oil underwent thermal cracking over glass beads
with nearly 20% conversion to gaseous and gasoline range products
at 500 °C. Besides, thermal cracking of canola oil was investigated in
a continuously operating pilot plant at different cracking tempera-
tures (450 580 °C) using silica sand as the bed material [122]. It was
found that the total fuel yield (TFY = (mgas + mgasoline + mLCO)/mfeed) at
450 °C was about 77.2 wt% and increased with higher temperatures.
Thirdly, the usual conditions of the FCC unit are severe enough to
ensure the catalytically induced decomposition of the triglycerides
of carbonic acids by means of decarboxylation, decarbonylation, or
dehydration reactions to yield a mixture of different hydrocarbons.
Despite the apparent advantages of such co-processing, only a lim-
ited number of publications dealt with this subject [50]. Neverthe-
less, the information available from open literature makes it possible
to draw some conclusions about the peculiarities of carrying out the
co-processing of vegetable and petroleum oils.

The co-processing of bio-oil with petroleum feeds under FCC con-
ditions causes less technological challenges in comparison with
cracking neat bio-oil. In the former case, such problems as plugging
can be avoided due to the usually used ratios between these feeds
when blended [22]. Nevertheless, possible problems during the cata-
lytic experiments should be assumed and prevented if possible.
Therefore, special attention should be paid to the choice of feed-
stocks and experimental units used in the co-processing experi-
ments also. Using large scale FCC units (pilot or experimental) seems
to be the most suitable choice, because they allow for carrying out
the experiments under conditions as close as possible to those used
in the real FCC process. Nevertheless, the operation of such units is
obviously an expensive issue which substantially limits the possibil-
ity to perform a broad research. Therefore, small laboratory installa-
tions which, however, must be able to mimic FCC cycles are more
often operated.

The thermal and oxidative stability of triglycerides (vegetable oil
and animal fats) and bio-oils is another important issue that has to
be considered. The stability of bio-based feedstocks may cause stor-
age problems due to the changes in density, viscosity, acidity, and an

increase in polymer formation [123]. In particular, triglycerides can
form polymers under storage which result in gumming problems in
heat exchangers and the hottest parts prior to the reactor. In turn,
the instability of the pyrolysis oil is mainly attributed to lignin
oligomers formed during pyrolysis [84]. Furthermore, the presence
of acids in bio-based feedstocks can lead to corrosive problems: tri-
glycerides may contain small admixtures of free fatty acids, while
oxygenated compounds such as phenols and carboxylic acids con-
tribute to the corrosiveness of bio-oils. Melero et al. [124] investi-
gated the oxidative and thermal stability of mixtures of vegetable
oils, animal fats and used cooking oils with petroleum feedstocks
and suggested that these mixtures can be stable for a period of at
least 180 days. To diminish the corrosivity of bio-based feedstocks,
the same methods are used as those applied in the case of acidic
crude oils (acidic crude oil means that the acid number is > 0.5 mg
KOH/g, and high TAN crude means that the acid number is > 1.0 mg
KOH/g [125]. These methods usually include (i) blending high TAN
with low TAN crude; (ii) upgrading construction materials, and (iii)
using corrosion inhibitors. In addition, the stability of the bio-oil can
be improved also through flash pyrolysis, hydrotreating or zeolite
upgrading (see Section 4.2.2).

4.1. Catalytic cracking technology

Laboratory-scale equipment is mostly used when investigating
the co-processing of bio-based feedstocks in catalytic cracking. This
allows controlling the process operationally and investigating the
influence of various variables on the characteristics of products. Sev-
eral types of laboratory equipment have been used to study the co-
processing of bio-oils and petroleum feedstocks. These include:

- Microactivity test (MAT) reactor, which is a fully automatic,
computerized and standardized (ASTM D3907) laboratory unit [82,
98, 99]. This equipment can adjust its time on stream time, catalyst/
oil ratio, reaction temperature, the regeneration times and tempera-
ture, gas flow, and other parameters for each independent experi-
ment. The catalyst loading is usually (cid:2) 10 g, and the reaction cycle
consists of cracking, stripping, regeneration and purging steps per-
formed in a single reactor. This equipment is mainly used as a tool
for catalyst screening [126]. Nevertheless, the simulation of the pro-
cesses which happen in an industrial FCC unit is rather complicated
in the MAT equipment because of the inherent fluid dynamics differ-
ences between a fixed bed and a fluidized bed, but also other impor-
tant aspects associated with large contact times [61]. It was also
pointed out [62] that a higher yield of liquid can be obtained in the
products with a fixed-bed reactor, but the olefinic content of the gas
product is much lower.

- The group of Schuurman and Mirodatos used a laboratory unit
with a fixed-bed quartz reactor containing 1.0 g of a catalyst [55,
56, 60, 70]. It was suggested that the equipment is validated
with respect to a microactivity test reactor (MAT) by bench-
marking experiments. Similar to MAT units, the reaction cycle
consists of in situ cracking, stripping the under flow of inert gas,
regeneration and purge.

- A specially designed and patented riser simulator reactor which
permits operation on a laboratory scale under similar conditions
to the FCC unit [58, 59]. This is an internal recycle reactor where
the catalyst is fluidized continuously (during the reaction run)
with an internal impeller for thrusting the gas (feed and prod-
ucts) throughout the catalyst bed. It was suggested that the riser
simulator is ideal for simulating the conditions employed in
industrial FCC units, particularly in terms of reaction time and
fluidization [59]. In contrast to MAT units, the regeneration of a
catalyst and the determination of coke amount using the mass
loss of the spent catalyst were performed by ex situ combustion
in a thermo balance.

- Advanced Catalyst Evaluation (ACETM) by BASF Inc. [96] or
Advanced Cracking Evaluation (ACE-RTM) by Kayser Technology
[52]. In both cases, the catalyst charge is 9 g. As in the case of
MAT units, the reaction cycle consists of cracking, stripping,
regeneration and purging steps.

- Laboratory-scale once-through micro-riser [127] that operates
in an isothermal plug-flow regime and simulates realistic FCC
conditions.

- Laboratory-scale two-stage riser fluid catalytic cracking unit
having the advantage of a catalyst relay, staged reaction, opti-
mum residence time and great catalyst to oil ratio [62]. Fresh
feedstock is injected into the first stage riser and recycling oil
into the second stage. Both risers share a common disengage
unit and regenerator. Thus, the fresh feedstock and the recycling
oil are in contact with regenerated catalyst.

- FCC pilot plant. Most research works on the co-processing of
RSO with petroleum oil on a pilot scale were performed using a
pilot-scale FCC unit built at the Vienna University of Technology
[51, 64]. It is suggested that in this continuous working reaction/
regeneration system, steady state operation can be performed,
which allows high comparability with large-scale FCC plants.

All these set-ups are intended for an effective and operational
evaluation of the performance of the modified FCC catalysts and dif-
ferent FCC feedstocks. They can provide important information on
suitable process parameters also (conversion, temperature) for
upgrading new/alternative feeds with respect to a standard FCC feed
(i.e., a kind of relative measure). The following examples show that
the mentioned experimental units are widely used to collect data on
the influence of various parameters on the qualitative and quantita-
tive characteristics of products obtained in the co-processing of bio-
oils and petroleum feedstocks.

However, it can be questioned whether the results obtained by
catalyst testing in laboratory units simulate the real catalyst perfor-
mance during commercial operation in some way. Biswas and Max-
well [17] pointed out that the major drawback of the laboratory
testing methods is the long cat/oil contact time (10(cid:1)100 s) com-
pared to the commercial operation (approximately 1 s). This
increases the contribution of hydrogen transfer reactions in the

overall conversion, thus decreasing the olefinicity and increasing the
aromatic and alkane contents of the gasoline fraction. Then, the fixed
bed MAT systems are non-steady state processes because the cata-
lyst has a higher activity at the onset of the test than at its end, so
the product slate and conversion change continually throughout an
experiment. The long contact time also results in a different conver-
sion-coke selectivity behavior from that of a commercial unit and
causes excessive over-cracking at low conversion levels. Accord-
ingly, Pinho et al. [53] pointed out that coke results obtained in cir-
culating FCC pilot risers were frequently lower than those observed
at lab scale experiments. Hence, knowledge about the experimental
unit set-up and operating conditions is essential to draw correct
conclusions, particularly when predicting future performance in an
industrial scale unit.

Comparing experiments performed in the conventional MAT
devices and the once-through micro-riser reactor Dupain et al. [127]
have concluded that the MAT experiments were usually performed
at lower temperatures (400(cid:1)500 °C) than the conventional FCC tem-
peratures (525(cid:1)575 °C). Also, the different hydrodynamic behavior
caused deviations in the observed phenomena. It may result in dif-
ferences in the distribution of reaction products as well as the con-
tent of oxygenates (CO2, CO and H2O). Nevertheless, Dupain et al.
[127] have suggested that the both testing devices (the MAT and the
micro-riser) ensured the catalytic cracking of unsaturated vegetable
oils and fatty acids and resulted in the formation of a highly aromatic
organic liquid product. In general, it may be concluded that, regard-
less of the type of equipment used, the purpose of the studies is to
understand the co-processing of the blends of vegetable and petro-
leum feedstocks in the context of FCC technology to meet legislative
requirements for a biofuel component in gasoline and diesel.

Reaction temperature: Ng et al. [50] reported that the conversion
of a blend of canola oil with HAGO increased as the temperature
increased from 490 to 530 °C and it was higher than the conversion
of neat HAGO (Fig. 8A). It was explained as a higher temperature is
the driving force to (1) promote cracking, thus producing more gases
and lighter liquid products, and (2) reduce the catalyst poisoning
effect (by basic nitrogen in the feed), which is more pronounced at
lower temperatures.

The increased cracking at elevated reaction temperature resulted
in the growth of the yield of LPG (Fig. 8B) which was always higher
for HAGO + Canola Oil than for HAGO due to the higher content of
aliphatic chains in the former feed. The gasoline yield from
HAGO + Canola Oil feed increased when increasing the temperature
from 490 to 510 °C because of the enhanced cracking of the feed and
reduced nitrogen poisoning of the catalyst (Fig. 8C). However, the
gasoline yield slightly decreased from 510 to 530 °C due to the grad-
ual exhaustion of gasoline precursors. These precursors are satu-
rated hydrocarbons and monoaromatics plus other crackable
components that predominantly contribute to the production of gas-
oline and its derived products, i.e., dry gas, LPG, and catalytic coke. In
contrast, the gasoline yield was virtually constant over the whole
temperature range. The LCO yield decreased from ca. 22% to 18(cid:1)19%
consistent with the increasing temperature (from 490 to 530 °C)
(Fig. 8D) which is a driving force to crack large molecules (e.g., those
in LCO) to smaller ones (e.g., those in gasoline and gases). Obviously,
at the same temperature, the blend always exhibits a slightly lower
LCO yield than HAGO (by 0(cid:1)2%) indicating that the blend is more
crackable than its counterpart. The coke content in the catalysts
increased from 3.5% to 4% with the growth of temperature from 490
to 530 °C as it was formed through the polymerization of aromatic
hydrocarbons in the cracked liquid product together with the con-
densation reaction involving the vegetable oil [50]. Similar results
were obtained by [66] when studying the co-processing of sunflower
oil with VGO. The increase in the reaction temperature from 450 to
510 °C resulted in the increase of conversion from 79.2% to 88.7%

and the yield of gaseous reaction products from 18.0% to 40.1%,
while the yields of gasoline and LCO decreased from 43.5% to 31.2%
and from 16.2% to 9.3%, correspondingly. Investigating the co-proc-
essing of cottonseed (CSO) and sunflower oils (SFO) with VGO at the
temperature range of 480(cid:1)540 °C, Abbasov et al. [63] found that the
optimal conversion has been achieved at 500 °C in all the cases and
varied at a 65(cid:1)75% range. At higher temperatures (T = 520(cid:1)540 °C),
rapid coking of the catalyst blocked active sites while at lower tem-
peratures (T = 480 °C) the reaction speed was very low.

The catalyst-to-oil mass ratio: The severity of the catalytic crack-
ing process can be modified not only by reaction temperature but
also by changing the catalyst-to-oil mass ratio (CTO). Melero et al.
[61] investigated the FCC co-processing of 30% palm oil in VGO and
found that, as the CTO increased from 3 to 6, a higher yield to gas-
eous products (from 2 to 3.8 wt% and from 11.5 to 23 wt% for dry gas
and LPG, respectively) and coke (from 1 to 4.7 wt%) as well as a lower
production of LCO (from 26 to 17 wt%) was achieved. The gasoline
fraction showed a peculiar tendency with the CTO. It was suggested
that gasoline is an unstable cracking product because it is obtained
from heavier cuts and it is possible to crack further if the severity of
the cracking process is adequate. This fact makes it probable that the
gasoline which should rise with an increase of the severity will be
cracked to lighter products and hence end up mainly as LPG. Because
of the presence of this opposite phenomenon, gasoline shows a max-
imum in the yield (46(cid:1)47 wt%) with an increase in the CTO. The
location of this maximum appears in a different position, and it is
more significant depending on the features of the feedstock.

Similar results were obtained in the study of Ng et al. [50]. They
observed the increase of conversion with CTO and tended to level off
at high CTOs. They claimed that this could be expected, as higher
CTO ratios (as high as 9(cid:1)11) provide proportionally more active acid
sites of the catalyst to crack a given amount of feed molecules. How-
ever, the cracking rate is reduced at high CTOs once the crackable
components in the feed are gradually exhausted. Both dry gas and
LPG also increased with the CTO, while the gasoline yield increased

with the CTO, but only up to a certain point (CTO (cid:3) 7(cid:1)9) at which
the yield started to decline. The authors explained this trend by the
gradual depletion of gasoline precursors and the accelerated conver-
sion of gasoline into gases and coke at high CTOs. The LCO yield also
decreased monotonously and parallel with the CTO, approaching the
limit of the LCO precursors defined as the sum of different aromatic
compounds, while the coke yield increased linearly with the CTO.

In contrast to the results from [50, 61], the decrease in gaseous
reaction products (dry gas and LPG) and considerable increase in
gasoline and stable content of LCO were observed with the growth
of the CTO in [65]. The authors explained the obtained results by the
additional joint transformations of rapeseed oil and HVGO feedstock
compounds which comprised several effects: the enhancement of
hydrogen transfer reactions (easier formation of carbenium ions) by
olefin intermediates formed during rapeseed oil cracking and lower-
ing the further cracking of gasoline-range hydrocarbons due to a
competitive sorption effect of C15(cid:1)C17 olefins which have a higher
tendency to form surface carbenium ions than the ones from the
gasoline fraction.

The bio-content ratio: The influence of the RSO (Rape Seed Oil)
content in the co-processing blend was investigated in several
articles [61, 63, 64, 66]. Doronin et al. [66] using a lab-scale MAT unit
showed that co-conversion of VGO and RSO under catalytic cracking
conditions increased both the total conversion of the blend feed and
the yields of gasoline fraction, and the maximum promoting effect
was provided by the addition of 5(cid:1)10 wt% vegetable oil. The authors
suggested that the addition of a small amount of lipids (up to
25 wt%) promotes the activation of paraffinic and naphthenic hydro-
carbons in the petroleum feedstock by hydrogen transfer reactions.
In the process, hydrocarbons of petroleum feedstock serve as hydro-
gen donors, while the primary semi-products of vegetable oil ther-
mal cracking, i.e., C15(cid:1)C17 olefins are hydrogen acceptors. According
to the proposed scheme, carbocations formed by the interaction of
the olefins with the catalyst active acid site react with paraffinic and
naphthenic hydrocarbons in the petroleum feedstock. Consequently,
hydrogen transfer reactions result in the formation of aromatic
hydrocarbons and isoparaffins and, thus,
in an increased VGO
conversion.

At a high concentration of olefins (a 25(cid:1)75 wt% content of vege-
table oil in the blend feed), the contribution of the secondary trans-
formations was great due to pronounced reactivity of the olefins.
This resulted in the formation of a large amount of mono- and poly-
aromatic hydrocarbons. Strong adsorption of these compounds on
the acid sites of the catalyst led to their deactivation, thus lowering
the catalyst activity.

Bielansky et al. [51] successfully converted the blends of VGO and
different vegetable oils in a fully continuous FCC small scale pilot
plant. They pointed out that no fundamental modifications were
necessary and no difficulties in the system occurred during the test
runs. The total fuel yield (gas + gasoline) decreased as the content of
rapeseed oil in the blend increased from 0% to 100%. The decrease in
total fuel yield at higher rapeseed oil ratios was attributed by the
authors to the oxygen content of the feed that notably influenced
the cracking gas amount.
Indeed, the amount of gasoline was
roughly constant for the different feeds studied, but the yield of the
cracking gas gradually decreased from 37.5 to 24.0 wt% with the
increase in the rapeseed oil content in the feed from 0% to 100%. The
decrease in gas production from pure vegetable oils in comparison
with petroleum feeds or their blends was also observed in other
studies [65, 127]. In contrast, Melero et al. [61] found an increased
formation of gaseous products (dry gas and LPG) as the palm oil con-
tent in the feed increased. According to Bielansky et al. [51], the yield
of LCO depended on the origin of used vegetable oil, while the coke
yields were approximately constant for all the investigated condi-
tions. Based on the nearly linear trends for the lumps with different
blends of vegetable oils and VGO, the authors assumed that the

reaction rate of both feeds was similar and no synergetic effects
seemed to occur.

A general observation was found in different studies [61, 64, 66]:
the number of double bounds in the fatty acids (in the order soy-
bean, rapeseed, palm oil) enhances the number of alkylation, cycliza-
tion and dehydrogenation reactions. It increases the total yield of
liquid cracking product and the content of aromatic hydrocarbons,
which are formed by aromatization of olefins, with a simultaneous
decrease in the yields of paraffinic and olefinic hydrocarbons. It was
also suggested [64] that, despite that aromatics in the gasoline
increase the octane number, they are undesired from an environ-
mental point of view.

Initial triglycerides are oxygen-containing compounds, while the
final products should be oxygen-free hydrocarbons. Consequently,
FCC processing should promote the effective deoxygenation of the
triglyceride-base molecules. It is believed [61] that the usual condi-
tions of the FCC unit are severe enough to decompose the heavy
oxygenated hydrocarbons by means of decarboxylation, decarbony-
lation, or dehydration reactions to yield a mixture of different hydro-
carbons, while oxygen molecules end up mainly as carboxylic gases
(CO and CO2) and, above all, water. Bielansky et al. [51] established
that about 13 times more water than carbon dioxide was formed
during the co-processing, indicating that most of the oxygen in the
feed was converted into water. A similar suggestion was also made
by Tian et al. [62]. Bielansky et al. [51] pointed out that the change in
the quality of the produced gasoline by adding vegetable oils to the
feedstock is of high importance. Two basic quality standards are the
octane numbers as well as the oxidation stability. In their study
increasing bio-oil content in the feedstock in the range of 0(cid:1)100%
increased the research octane number (RON) by two units while the
motor octane number (MON) stayed approximately constant. Addi-
tionally, the increase of oil content in the feed (0(cid:1)100%) also gradu-
ally enhanced oxidation stabilities. Abbasov et al. [63] also found
that acid values of liquid reaction product have increased only mar-
ginally upon the addition of triglycerides, indicating an effective
decarboxylation process. Tian et al. [62] performed the elemental
analysis of the reaction products and found that oxygen content of
the liquid products were relatively low (0.32(cid:1)0.58%) i.e., oxygen was
present predominantly in the form of H2O, CO and CO2. Similarly,
Lovas et al. [65] suggested that the use of the catalytic system con-
sisting of FCC-ECAT + 10 wt% of FCC-ZSM-5 suppressed the content
of the oxygenates under the detection limit of the GS-MS apparatus
as their amount throughout the whole CTO ratio range was on the
level of a ten thousandth of weight percent.

Analysis of the water phase was performed in [64]. It was found
that the pH value of this phase was slightly basic for a low vegetable
oil content in the blends but became acidic at ratios above 40%.
Water samples from the co-processing had significant contents of
acetic and propionic acids (600(cid:1)1700 ppm) while the concentration
of formic and butyric acids was smaller ((cid:2) 300 ppm).

4.2.2. Co-processing of bio-oils

In most cases, the co-processing of different bio-oils (flash pyrol-
ysis bio-oil (FPO), catalytic pyrolysis oil (CPO), and hydrotreated
pyrolysis oil (HPO)) and petroleum fractions is performed at reaction
temperatures which are usual for ordinary FCC processing, i.e., about
530 °C [17]. Nevertheless, examples on the study of reaction temper-
ature outside this range on the co-processing parameters are also
known.

Reaction temperature: As could be expected, the overall conver-
sion increased as the temperature was increased both in the case of
the co-processing of HPO with LCO [99] and the FPO with VGO [58].
Samolada et al. [99] found that the increase in reaction temperature
from 500 °C to 550 °C during the co-processing of HPO and LCO
resulted in a substantial increase in the conversion from 18% to
32%. On the contrary, the coke content decreased because the

with the benchmark (Standard #4350 Gas oil) at a 70% constant con-
version. The authors found that the blending of the Standard #4350
Gas oil with 15 wt% CPO did not have any obvious adverse effect on
the yield of various cracked fractions, especially the gasoline fraction
(Fig. 10A). Based on this result, they suggested that at a catalyst to
oil ratio of 6, the CPO/gas oil blends can be used to produce gasoline
with similar yields as petroleum gas oil thus constituting a true
replacement for gasoline produced entirely from petroleum.

Agblevor et al. [96] also investigated the effects of catalyst to oil
ratios (CTO) and suggested that the co-processing of CPO with gas
oil was very sensitive to the CTO ratio because this ratio affected the
conversion and subsequently the product yields and other parame-
ters. They found that with a decreasing CTO ratio, the overall conver-
sion also decreased. It resulted in the corresponding decrease in both
dry gas and LPG yields. The coke yield also showed a decrease: as the
CTO ratio was decreased, the catalyst could not promote coke form-
ing reactions. These results are similar to what has been traditionally
observed for the cracking FCC feed. In contrast, the HCO and LCO
yields increased as the CTO decreased what was also attributed to
the lower conversion. The authors pointed out that the almost con-
stant yield of gasoline from this process was observed with a varia-
tion of the CTO ratio. The minimal change in the gasoline yields was
attributed to the attainment of a pseudo steady state, where the
change in the CTO ratio, generated more gasoline from the LCO/HCO,
but the gasoline subsequently was converted into LPG. Similar
results, i.e., an increase in the overall conversion, gas and coke yield
and LCO and bottom decrease with the growth of the CTO ratio were
observed in other studies [55, 57, 60, 70, 99].

The examples of the co-processing of FPO, CPO and HPO with
petroleum feedstocks at FCC conditions using laboratory scale units
(MAT and ACE) are summarized in Table 7 which contains informa-
tion on the type of both bio- and petroleum feeds, their ratio in the
reaction mixture and catalysts used for the co-processing as well as
variations in reaction conditions.

From experiments on the catalytic cracking of pure bio-oils in the
FCC process, it was summarized that reactor plugging might be a
crucial issue because char and coke formation was substantial, even
at low reaction temperatures [99, 131(cid:1)133]. Consequently, bio-oil
cracking resulted in irreversible catalyst deactivation by dealumina-
tion of the zeolite component mainly because of the high oxygen
content in the feed and substantial water steam presence in the
reaction medium. Based on these conclusions, it was suggested that
the quality of the raw bio-oil with a high content of oxygenates, i.e.,
produced by fast pyrolysis, is too low to be co-processed directly
with a petroleum feed in a standard FCC process [54, 82, 107]. There-
fore, upgrading the FPO, mostly by hydrotreatment to remove the
most reactive components in the bio-oil, is often performed prior to
its co-processing with the petroleum feedstock [52, 55, 56, 82, 107].
Moreover,
it was also suggested that the more upgraded HPO
afforded lower coke and dry gas yields during FCC [82]. Correspond-
ingly, most published studies have investigated the co-processing of
bio-oil stabilized by hydrogenation step (i.e., HPO feedstock with the
lowest oxygen content and, therefore the lowest plugging problems)
with conventional FCC feedstocks, vacuum gas oil (VGO) or light
cycle oil (LCO) to assess the suitability of using HPO as a potential
co-feed [52, 55, 56, 82].

The basic parameters of HPO co-processing with petroleum feed-
stocks were reviewed in [22, 24]. To mention briefly, the influence of
HPO added to petroleum-based feedstocks on the conversion level
observed in the FCC co-processing is not yet fully understood. It
could depend either on the type of the fossil feed [70] or on the type
of the catalysts being used, because the properties of the equilibrium
catalysts were often not specified in the studies [22]. The data in
Table 7 indicates that the co-processing results could be significantly
affected by the properties of bio-oils as these vary in a great extent in
different studies. As to product distribution, the cracking of the bio-

incremental conversion mainly produced gasoline and light gases.
They also suggested that higher temperatures should be avoided to
prevent secondary cracking reactions producing additional coke
and/or gases. Nonetheless, the authors decided to perform all further
experiments at 550 °C since a conversion lower than 20 wt% was
declared undesirable. Unfortunately, no information on the process-
ing of pure LCO under same reaction condition was provided.

Ibarra et al. [58] investigated the effect of temperature and reac-
tion time on the conversion of pure VGO and the blend (80% VGO
with 20% FPO) (Fig. 9). First of all, the blend conversion was higher
than the conversion of VGO over the whole operating range what
the authors attributed to the synergistic effect of the joint cracking
since the conversion of neat bio-oil was in the range 55(cid:1)65%, while
the conversions of VGO and the blend were in the range 49(cid:1)68% and
56(cid:1)74%, respectively. Furthermore, the conversion substantially
increased as the temperature was increased from 500 to 560 °C. The
evolution of the product yields with the conversion for the cracking
of the VGO/bio-oil blend and the individual feeds allowed the fol-
lowing conclusions to be made. The dry gas yield increased due to
methane and ethane produced by the thermal cracking of oxygen-
ates from the raw bio-oil. The LPG yield also increased due to the
cracking of heavy molecular weight components leading to the com-
pounds in this lump, as well as those in the dry gas. The coke yield
increased with increasing conversion in the cracking. This was
attributed to the fact that under the conditions studied, an increase
in temperature and reaction time mainly promoted coke formation
reactions by condensation of heavy volatile compounds rather than
the cracking of these volatile compounds that are intermediates in
the coke formation. The yield of oxygenates decreased to 2.1 wt% as
the conversion increased to 70 wt% which shows that the oxygenate
conversion is significant [58]. Considering the distribution of resid-
ual oxygenates among different products, it was noted that no oxy-
genates were found in the LCO fraction, but the presence of
unconverted oxygenate compounds in the gasoline lump was due to
their low reactivity.

The catalyst-to-oil mass ratio: The effect of the catalyst-to-oil mass
ratios (CTO) on the performance of the bio-oil and petroleum oil co-
processing was investigated in several studies [55, 60, 70, 96]. Table 7
evidences that this parameter varied over a wide range of 1(cid:1)9 thus
allowing for significantly modifying the conversion and yields.
Agblevor et al. [96] demonstrated that the CPO was stable enough to
be co-processed with a standard FCC feed to produce various frac-
tions of hydrocarbon fuels. First, a blend of 15 wt% CPO and 85 wt%
Standard #4350 Gas oil, i.e., a SRGO, was evaluated and compared

Fig. 10. A (cid:1) Yields of hydrocarbon fractions obtained from the co-processing of CPO/gas oil (15/85) blends and gas oil at a 70% conversion. B (cid:1) Influence of catalysts to oil ratio on
the feed conversion as well as the yields of dry gas, LPG, gasoline, LCO, HCO, and coke during the FCC cracking of CPO/gas oil (15/85) blends [96].

oil/VGO mixture provided higher low-value dry gas (H2, CO, CO2, and
C1(cid:1)C2) yields and lower liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) yields than a
pure VGO feed [70]. While there are discrepancies in the literature
with respect to the yield of gasoline and LCO [70, 99], there is agree-
ment concerning the increase in coke content during co-processing
in comparison with the cracking of pure VGO [70, 82, 99]. As an
exception, Huynh et al. [97] observed no significant difference in the
observed coke yield between the co-feeding and neat conventional
feed, independent of the CTO ratios. However, no explanation of the
observed trend was provided by the authors.

The co-processing of hydrogenated pyrolysis oils (HPO) with fos-
sil feeds in refineries constitutes a promising route toward the pro-
duction of greener transportation fuels. Nevertheless, an obvious
disadvantage of the bio-oil hydrotreatment to oxygen content close
to 5 wt% is the necessity to use significant quantities of hydrogen
which would make the technology economically unviable [98].
Gueudr(cid:3)e et al. [129] found that the best naphtha quality (in terms of
RON, MON, and paraffins, isoparaffins, olefins, naphthenes, aro-
matics (PIONA) composition) could be achieved with mildly hydro-
treated pyrolysis liquids corresponding to an H2 consumption of
202 NL/kgbio-oil.

To decrease the cost of bio-oil hydrotreatment, Mercader et al.
[82] used milder conditions for FPO upgrading. They concluded that
bio-oils do not require complete hydrodeoxygenation to decrease
coke formation and prevent unsuccessful FCC co-processing. Thus,
the goal of the upgrading should be the elimination of the highly
reactive components and functional groups with minimized hydro-
gen consumption only. Nonetheless, such upgrading technology is
still under development and requires the use of an expensive noble
metal catalyst [82, 107]. Therefore, eliminating the costly hydro-
genation step by a catalytic pyrolysis step can be considered as a
competitive approach to bio-oil upgrading by hydrotreating [54, 60].
Recent publications show that both FPO and CPO can be used
directly in mixture with petroleum feed for FCC co-processing [58,
59, 96] also.

The co-processing of CPO with different types of gas oils was suc-
cessfully demonstrated by Agblevor et al. [96]. They studied the co-
processing of 15 wt% CPO blended with 85 wt% straight run standard
fluid catalytic cracking feed (Gulf Coast standard #4350 Gas oil). For
the same conversion of 70% for both the standard gas oil and the
CPO/gas oil blends, the gasoline yield was 44 wt%, light cycle oil
(LCO) 17 wt%, heavy cycle oil (HCO) 13 wt%, and LPG 16 wt%. The liq-
uid fractions produced from the co-processing were rich in aromatic
hydrocarbons, contained bio-carbons, and less than one percent oxy-
gen. The coke yield for the blends was 6.64(cid:1)6.81 wt% which was
lower compared to the standard gas oil run (7.06 wt%). It was attrib-
uted to be hydrogen transferred from the cracking of the standard

gas oil to the bio-crude oil which subsequently eliminated the oxy-
gen in the fuel without external hydrogen addition.

Ibarra et al. [58] investigated the catalytic cracking of a blend of
raw bio-oil produced by fast pyrolysis (20 wt%) and VGO (80 wt%) in
a patented riser simulator reactor with an in-built impeller. The
authors found the existence of a relationship between the mecha-
nisms for the cracking of the hydrocarbons in the VGO and oxygen-
ates in the bio-oil which had great impact on the yields and lump
concentrations. A favorable synergistic effect was observed on the
LPG (C3and C4) and gasoline (C5(cid:1)C12) yields (higher values than
expected in the absence of synergy), while the formation of CO2 and
CO was lowered. Moreover, co-feeding prevented coke formation,

degree of 95 wt% was obtained, with a total liquid fuel yield of
52.8 wt% and a gasoline yield of 31.6 wt%, with a low oxygenate frac-
tion (< 4 wt%) which contained carboxylic acids, aldehydes, ketones,
and phenols.

The above examples show that not only HPO but also CPO and
FPO may be considered as a promising bio-additive to petroleum-
derived feedstock for FCC co-processing. Nevertheless, considering
the results from different studies, it is difficult to evaluate the effi-
ciency of the different bio-oils as a bio-additive in the co-processing
and to make any conclusion about the influence of the type of bio-oil
on the co-processing characteristics because of the differences in the
properties of the bio-oils, reaction conditions, etc. Hence, publica-
tions dealing with comparative studies on the co-processing of dif-
similar
ferently prepared bio-oils with petroleum feeds at
conditions are of an increased interest.

Naik et al. [52] compared the co-processing of petroleum derived
VGO with either FPO or HPO in a laboratory scale Advanced Cracking
Evaluation (ACE-R) unit. The authors suggested that low blending
ratios of 5:95 and 10:90 of FPO with VGO was extremely suitable to
produce light olefins, mainly LPG, at the expense of gasoline range
hydrocarbons. In contrast, a decrease in dry gas yield and an increase
in liquid hydrocarbons were observed with an increase in the FPO
blending ratio with VGO up to 20:80. Nevertheless, the authors con-
cluded that the FPO containing 32 wt% of oxygen seemed to be less
suitable for the co-processing of VGO with FPO for higher gasoline
yield, as the FPO containing the lignin-derived monomers could not
be successfully cracked with the FCC catalysts. In contrast, the co-
processing of HPO with VGO resulted in an increase in the yields of
gasoline and LCO as compared to the co-processing of FPO with
VGO, at the similar blending ratio of 5:95. The FCC distillate from the
co-processing of FPO with VGO contained more iso-paraffinic CH3
substructure components, whereas the distillate fraction from the
co-processing HPO with VGO contained more paraffinic CH3 sub-
structures. The coke yield was found to be within the measurement

53

uncertainty limit, and in fact, lower than in the cracking of the neat
VGO over the same equilibrium FCC catalyst. Hence, HPO may be
considered for co-processing with VGO in the FCC unit without
many modifications in the process configuration and catalyst,
whereas the co-processing of FPO would require some modifica-
tions.

Analyzing the properties of FPO, Thegarid et al. [60] suggested
that this kind of bio-oil cannot be co-processed directly with fossil
feed to liquid fuels due to their oxygen rich composition, low heating
value, immiscibility with hydrocarbon fuels, chemical instability,
high viscosity and corrosiveness, and concluded that the co-process-
ing has to be preceded by an upgrading step such as hydrodeoxyge-
nation. They compared a bio-oil that has been produced by catalytic
pyrolysis (CPO) with an upgraded one (partially deoxygenated) ther-
mal pyrolysis oil (HPO) in co-processing with VGO under FCC condi-
tions. The main differences between the VGO processing and the
HPO/VGO co-processing were found to be in the increased coke pro-
duction, less hydrogen, more olefins and aromatics and the presence
of alkyl-phenols in the case of HPO co-processing with VGO. If com-
paring CPO/VGO and HPO/VGO co-processing, small but significant
differences in the product distribution and quality were observed.
The excess of oxygen in the CPO as compared with HPO resulted in
higher hydrogen consumption due to water formation, explaining
the lower hydrogen production in comparison with HPO/VGO and
the higher concentration of olefins and aromatics, especially at high
feed conversion. Another specificity of the CPO was that it contained
heavier components most likely consisting of lignin polymers. Con-
sequently, a higher concentration of alkylphenols was found in the
gasoline fraction when co-processing CPO as compared to HPO co-
processing. Additionally, the higher gasoline yield during the CPO
co-processing than in the HPO co-processing observed during the
co-processing was ascribed to the reduced rate of cracking of the
gasoline fraction due to its higher aromatic character. Nevertheless,
these differences such as the higher concentration of unconverted
phenolics in the gasoline or its higher content of aromatics could be
reduced by further catalyst development both on the pyrolysis as
well as on the FCC side. Taken together, it was concluded that the
hydrogenation step could be eliminated by the addition of a suitable
catalyst in the biomass pyrolysis step, thus reducing the biomass
upgrading costs significantly.

Lindfors et al. [98] studied the co-processing of three differently
prepared bio-oils, i.e., dry thermal bio-oil (FPO), catalytic pyrolysis
oil (CPO), and hydrotreated pyrolysis oil (HPO). CPO oil and HPO oil
had lower carbonyl contents and lower oxygen contents but a higher
content of low-molecular-mass (LMM) lignin in comparison with
FPO. On the other hand, the amount of high-molecular-mass (HMM)
lignin was higher in the CPO oil as compared to the HPO oil, as evi-
denced from the chemical composition of the bio-oil feeds deter-
mined using a solvent fractionation scheme (Fig. 11).

treated oil determined by a solvent fractionation scheme [98].

In the co-processing of the dry FPO with VGO in different ratios, it
was found that good mass balances in experiments with this bio-oil
could be obtained only when using low bio-component concentra-
tions, while at higher bio-oil concentrations coking was a problem
when carrying out the experiments [98]. This led to the conclusion
that the bio-oil concentration should be low during co-processing.
That is why all comparative experiments on the co-processing of dry
FPO, CPO, and HPO were performed with the oil content of 20 wt%.
The obtained results showed that the bio-oil properties influenced
the process. The co-processing of dry FPO resulted in a slightly lower
liquid yield compared to the partly upgraded bio-oils, but the differ-
ences in the product distribution between different oils were very
small in total (Table 8). Unfortunately, the experiments were not
performed at the same conversion level and, consequently, the
higher conversion in the case of co-processing than in case of neat
VGO processing prevents a fair comparison of VGO processing with
the bio-oils co-processing. Nonetheless, the comparison of different
bio-oils co-processing is possible as a conversion of about 40% was
reached in these experiments. Moreover, the chemical compounds
present in the liquid products from the co-processing experiments
were almost identical to those found in the product from VGO crack-
ing. The main compounds identified by GC ¡ MSD (Mass Selective
Detector) were alkyl benzenes, naphthalenes, and straight-chain
hydrocarbons, while no oxygen-containing compounds were
detected. Nevertheless, coke formation was higher for FPO and the
more aromatic CPO in comparison with HPO. The high coke yield
with the dry FPO was partly caused by the sugar-like material in the
oil (Fig. 11). Indeed, Carlson et al. [134] investigated the fast pyroly-
sis of glucose in presence of HZSM-5 and found that at high pyrolysis
temperatures, glucose is dehydrated to form anhydro-sugars and
furans. The latter compounds are easily polymerized and further
ultimately decompose to unsaturated coke which represents large
graphitic species like those observed on the external surface of the
ZSM-5 during the conversion of methanol to hydrocarbons [135].
The difference in the coke yield between the HPO and CPO co-proc-
essing can be attributed to their different chemical compositions:
the latter oil clearly contained more high-molecular-mass (HMM)
lignin, which was a highly probable precursor for coke formation or
direct fouling of the catalyst. In contrast to this, the HDO process
decreased the oxygen content of the bio-oil while simultaneously
boosting its hydrogen content. This change resulted in the saturation
of many ring structures, thus making the bio-oil less prone toward
coking [98].

Gueudr(cid:3)e et al. [57] put an emphasis on the study of coke chemis-
try occurring in FCC on ultra-stable zeolite Y (USY) catalysts during
the co-processing of VGO blended with various types of upgraded
lignocellulosic biomass,
bio-oils produced by fast pyrolysis of
namely HPO and CPO. The yield of gasoline fraction was changed
only slightly after blending HPO or CPO with VGO, while the yield of
the LCO fraction decreased in the presence of the bio-oils. This could
be explained by the lower average molecular weight of the bio-oils
in comparison with VGO. Besides, the coke fraction was markedly
though almost
increased in the presence of

the bio-oils,

independently of the nature/composition of the added bio-oil (HPO
or CPO). This could be attributed to the higher reactivity (due to the
presence of oxygenates and unsaturated compounds) of the bio-oil
in comparison with VGO. The investigation of the spent catalysts
with TPO/TGA/DTA/MS and FTIR helped to conclude that the crack-
ing of the bio-oils involved the consumption of most of the hydrogen
present in the feedstock (lignin fragments) by hydrogen transfer
reactions leading to highly dehydrogenated coke deposits. Neverthe-
less, slightly more carbon was accumulated on the spent catalyst
samples (USY) after co-processing CPO with VGO than after neat
VGO cracking. This was attributed to a higher oxygen content and
larger lignin fragments in the non-hydrotreated catalytic pyrolysis
bio-oil. Hence, it was concluded that the formation of additional
coke (about 4%) under co-processing conditions may have a
strong impact on the catalyst regeneration during the FCC cycle.
Indeed, according to a rule of thumb generally accepted in FCC
operation, an increase of 0.1 wt% in the delta coke (delta
coke = coke yield/cat/oil ratio) might increase the regenerator
temperature by about 20 °C. Accordingly, an increase of about 4%
in the coke yield at a cat/oil of 6 would lead to an increase in
the regenerator temperature of about 130 °C, which might create
irreversible hydrothermal damage to the circulating catalyst [57].
No doubt, the increased coke formation during the co-processing
of petroleum fractions with the bio-oil is considered as an appar-
ent drawback which should be avoided.

It is worth noting that most of the above examples are related to
the simulation of FCC co-processing on a laboratory level using a
fixed-bed MAT reactor with a catalyst loading of several grams. In
this case, regardless of the type of bio-oil used, an increase in coke
formation was observed [55, 56, 60, 82, 98, 99]. However, an
increased coke formation was not reported when the co-processing
was performed using a fluidized-bed MAT reactor [88, 107] or a lab-
scale riser simulator reactor [58, 59, 96]. Agblevor et al. [96] reported
that when performing the FCC co-processing experiments using an
ACE unit, the hydrogen and coke yields in the co-processing of bio-
oil with Standard Gas Oil (SGO) and in cracking neat SGO showed
considerable differences. In co-processing, 8.2% less hydrogen was
produced than in the processing of SGO which was attributed to the
bio-oil being hydrogen deficient. However, the hydrogen yield in co-
processing was higher than it should have been expected provided
that all the oxygen in the bio-oil was converted into water. Conse-
quently, the authors suggested that part of the oxygen was rejected
as CO or CO2 rather than converted into water or over-cracking took
place during co-processing. Agblevor et al. [96] also observed that
the coke yield in the co-processing was lower than in the SGO proc-
essing. They attributed this to the inhibition effect of the bio-oil on
the coke formation reactions. They explained this effect by the pres-
ence of steam and in-situ generated hydrogen from the cracking of
the SGO, which moderated the coke formation reactions in spite of
the low H/C ratio.

Comparing the above-discussed results obtained on different
experimental units, it is obvious that the choice of reactor type is a
crucial factor to be considered when evaluating the prospects of the
bio-oil co-processing and evaluating the product selectivities.

Pilot- and demo-scale FCC units similar to real industrial FCC
units are clearly a better choice to carry out experiments when
studying bio-oil co-processing with petroleum fractions. Neverthe-
less, access to such kinds of equipment is limited, their operation is
complicated and costly, and they also require access to an adequate
feed supply [28]. Therefore, the examples of using larger pilot scale
installations with process flow operation similar to industrial FCC
units for co-processing are rare. Nevertheless, studies on the co-
processing of bio-oils with petroleum fractions performed on an
enlarged pilot scale provides sufficient information on the features
of the experiments derived from the difference in the unit construc-
tion and size.

Lappas et al. [95] performed experiments on the co-processing of
a hydrotreated heavy bio-oil fraction with a conventional VGO using
a small-scale FCC pilot plant unit which was operated in full catalyst
circulation mode with continuous regeneration and consisted of a
riser reactor, a stripper, a lift-line and a fluid bed as the regenerator
system. In total, the pilot plant was fully automated and its process
control system was based on a special industrial control system. The
authors suggested that the main problem with the blend of the
above heavy hydrotreated fraction with conventional VGO could be
the plugging of the injection nozzle of the small-scale FCC pilot
plant. To overcome this issue, they diluted the HPO with LCO (15/85
by weight) and the mixture was finally blended with a conventional
FCC feed (VGO). The total mixture of the LCO + HPO was 15 wt%.
Experiments in the unit showed that the VGO/HPO co-feed produced
about 1 wt% more gasoline and more LCO in comparison with the
VGO feed, i.e., the hydrotreated bio-oil components favored cracking
into gasoline and diesel components. It was concluded, therefore,
that the selectivity of some FCC products was favored by the pres-
ence of an HPO [95].

Expectedly, the coke yield was higher in the case of co-process-
ing, however, the slight increase in coke yield was affordable for the
FCC process from the technological point of view [95]. In contrast to
the previously described products, all LPG gas yields were lower
when the bio-oil was added in the feed. In general, it was concluded
that the performed tests showed that co-feeding a petroleum VGO
with a thermally hydrotreated bio-oil is technically viable for FCC
units running with good quality feedstocks (and thus having excess
coke burning capacity). Nevertheless, more experimental work is
necessary to clarify any additional effects, for example, the influence
of the bio-oil concentration (as co-feed) on the FCC product yields
and selectivities, as well as on the quality of these products [95].

Wang et al. [54] collected data on the FCC bio-oil co-processing in
an automated pilot-plant FCC unit. The pilot plant was operated in
full catalyst circulation mode with continuous regeneration and con-
sisted of a riser reactor, stripper, lift line, and fluidized bed as the
regenerator. The catalyst circulation was achieved with two slide
valves, and it was controlled in a manner similar to that in a com-
mercial FCC unit. The authors studied the effect of a CPO addition
(10%) to VGO and found that the co-processing of the blend gave
nearly equivalent oxygenate content and also similar selectivities to
gasoline, bottom oil, and coke as the catalytic cracking of neat VGO,
suggesting that the CPO was a suitable feedstock for FCC co-process-
ing. At the same time, the dry gas, including hydrogen and light
hydrocarbons, obviously reduced in the co-processing experiment
because of the hydrogen transfer between the bio-feedstock and the
VGO. The co-processing experiments also resulted in the formation
of CO, CO2 and water; however, their amounts in the CPO co-proc-
essing case were much lower than in the FPO co-processing. Conse-
quently, the authors concluded that the co-processing of CPO with
petroleum fractions was highly promising for biomass conversion
into biofuel.

Pinho et al. [53, 130] provided information on bio-oil co-process-
ing with a petroleum fraction on the largest scale which was suc-
cessful so far. They performed catalytic tests in a demonstration-
scale fluid catalytic cracking unit equipped with a pseudo-adiabatic
riser reactor and a continuous catalyst regenerator, operating under
steady state conditions. The catalyst inventory was 450 kg and the
total feed rate was controlled at 150 kg/h. In contrast to lab-scale
reactors the use of the demonstration-scale unit allowed for the suc-
cessful co-processing of the VGO mixed with 10 and 20 wt% FPO,
even though the bio-oil and conventional petroleum fractions are
poorly miscible or even totally immiscible due to the high polarity of
the bio-oil [53]. The successful experiment with a high FPO content
in the mixture was achieved by using two different axial injection
positions in the FCC riser reactor. The authors concluded that the
bio-oil could be directly co-processed without any type of

55

hydrodeoxygenation and with a regular gas oil FCC feed containing
up to 20 wt% bio-oil. The blend of the bio-oil and VGO was cracked
into valuable products such as LPG and gasoline rendering similar
product yields as those obtained from neat VGO when the feed con-
tained up to 10 wt% bio-oil. However, there was a clear drop in the
gasoline yield when 20% bio-oil was added to the feed due to the
dilution effect caused by water. The same trend was observed for
LCO yields, while the bottoms yields increased slightly when 20%
bio-oil was added to the feed. The introduction of a 10% bio-oil in
the riser reactor did not significantly increase coke, whereas the use
of 20% clearly increasedthe coke yield. Most of the oxygen present in
the bio-oil was removed as water. Nevertheless, special care must
also be dedicated to the tanks used for the bio-oil storage and feed
lines in the FCC unit to deal with the high acidity of the bio-oil.
Moreover, alkaline metals present in the bio-oil may destroy the
zeolite in the FCC catalyst and higher make-up rates would have to
be employed to ensure FCC equilibrium catalyst activity [53].

In a recent article, Pinho et al. [130] demonstrated the effect of
aging a bio-oil on the technical feasibility of co-processing a raw
bio-oil with VGO. The tests conducted with the same bio-oil in two
different experimental test series showed that while a 9-month-old
bio-oil did not cause operating problems in the FCC unit, a 21-month
aged bio-oil may affect the operating conditions. Nevertheless, the
authors suggested the necessity of more data to further investigate
the optimization of the co-processing. It was suggested, based on
the MAT results [60, 98], that coke formation during the co-process-
ing is excessively high when raw (untreated) bio-oil is used as a bio-
component. Hence, raw bio-oil hydrotreatment to reduce the high
concentration of heteroatoms has been recommended prior to con-
tact with petroleum feeds. In contrast, Pinho et al. [53] proposed
that a considerable increase in coke production even at low bio-oil
amounts was a consequence of using small-scale units. Based on the
results obtained in a demonstration-scale fluid catalytic cracking
unit they tried to explain which characteristics inherent to small-
scale units could stand up for the differences in yields observed in a
much larger scale unit. First, a single feed line used in most of the
FCC laboratory-scale units enormously complicates the feeding of
bio-oils in the co-processing experiments because bio-oils are not
miscible with petroleum streams and may result in an inhomoge-
neous feed entering the reactor. Moreover, excessive heating of the
feed lines, above 50 °C, promotes bio-oil polymerization and causes
plugging. However, such a low temperature is not suitable for VGO
feeding because it causes an increase in the VGO viscosity and
impairs the proper dispersion in the feed nozzle. Insufficient feed
dispersion increases the amount of coke deposited on the catalyst
and damages the catalyst selectivity. These problems may be, how-
ever, overcome in larger scale units, when different feed lines are
used to segregate the bio-oil from the VGO (or other fossil stream),
allowing adequate heating and dispersion of each feed. Indeed, in
pilot scale installations which have a technological scheme similar
to real FCC units, biomass feedstocks can be injected at a number of
different positions of the FCC reactor relative to the VGO feed, i.e.,
before the VGO, with the VGO, after the VGO feed, or even in the
regenerator or in a separate riser reactor. These different zones
involve different temperatures and catalytic activities [19].

Second, large scale units can overcome the issues related to the
presence of high molecular weight molecules (cellulose, hemi-cellu-
lose and lignin) which are not destroyed in the fast pyrolysis process
[136]. In a real FCC unit, the bio-oil can be injected at the bottom of
the riser, before the regenerated catalyst contacts the VGO. Conse-
quently, it may be cracked at higher temperatures and the catalyst-
to-oil (CTO) mass ratios (at the bottom of the riser, the local CTO
ratio is approximately 10 times higher and the catalyst temperature
is approximately 690 °C). The thermal shock between the hot regen-
erated catalyst and the large bio-oil molecules promotes their quick
thermal cracking, transforming them into smaller molecules, which

can then penetrate the catalyst pores and react there. If such thermal
cracking is not possible, the bio-oil will not vaporize completely; a
part of it will remain in a liquid form and will most likely be depos-
ited as coke on the catalyst. Consequently, the deposited coke will
decrease the catalyst selectivity and deteriorate the FCC yield profile.
However, most of the equipment used on a laboratory scale, such as
MAT reactors or ACE units, work isothermally and the entire reactor
is kept uniformly at the same temperature, which is unrealistic for
an industrial FCC operation. In this case, the thermal shock between
the hot catalyst and the bio-oil is not possible. The non-vaporized
fraction of the bio-oil will remain liquid and hence yield more coke.
Thus, although MAT reactors and ACE units are economical options
for the investigation of most of FCC applications using distillate
petroleum feeds, they are inadequate to deal with heavy feeds, such
as atmospheric residues and bio-oils [53]. Similarly, Wang et al. [54]
also suggested that the oxygen in the bio-oil can be removed almost
completely in their FCC co-processing study and a low oxygen con-
tent in the final product in comparison with results from other lab-
scale cracking experiments, which was attributed to the difference
in the operation scale and to the benefits of thermal shock effect in
the pilot-scale unit.

4.3. Catalysts

The processes that take place in the FCC reactor are based on sev-
eral types of reactions, including protolytic cracking (cleavage of car-
bon(cid:1)carbon bonds), hydrogen transfer, and isomerization [137]. The
same reactions should apparently occur in the case of the co-proc-
essing of petroleum and bio-based feedstocks. Moreover, the FCC
process in this case has to ensure the removal of oxygen from the
bio-based feedstock by dehydration, decarboxylation, and decarbon-
ylation because the final product should be substantially oxygen-
free to meet the requirements for motor fuels [18, 93]. FCC equilib-
rium (E-CAT) catalysts which are used in refineries demonstrate
high effectiveness in this kind of reactions. Such typical catalysts
usually contain 10(cid:1)30 wt% faujasite zeolite (USY or REUSY) dis-
persed in a matrix consisting typically of silica(cid:1)alumina, alumina,
clay (kaolin) and special additives (i.e., NOX reduction additives, gas-
oline sulfur reduction additives, CO combustion, promoters, ZSM-5
as an additive to produce light olefins).

In most cases, the FCC co-processing of petroleum and vegetable
oils or bio-oil proceeds in presence of refinery-generated equilib-
rium catalysts (E-CAT) (Tables 6 and 7) which are very effective in
the production of valuable reaction products as well as in removing
oxygen from the biomass by transformation into CO2, CO, and water
without using hydrogen [18]. Nevertheless, several studies tried to
answer the question in which respect the addition of other catalysts
changed the conversion of the blends and the distribution of the
reaction products. Dupain et al. [127] found that the addition of
ZSM-5 enhanced the cracking of vegetable oils thus resulting in
higher gas yield but lower LCO and gasoline yields compared to the
E-CAT alone. Similar results were obtained in [65]. However, no data
was provided for the comparative co-processing experiments with-
out/with ZSM-5 addition to the E-CAT.

Abbasov et al. [63] investigated the co-processing of VGA and
vegetable oils using the mixture of E-CAT and halloysite nanotubes
(natural clay nanotubes with large 5(cid:1)20 inner lumen) as a catalyst.
It increased the conversion of the feedstock by 3(cid:1)5% which contrib-
uted to the additional increase in the gasoline and LPG at the
expense of the LCO. The addition of the halloysite also promoted the
efficiency of skeletal
isomerization, resulting in the increase of
branched paraffins and alkyl benzenes. Moreover, the coke yield was
reduced by 7(cid:1)10% due to the faster desorption of the reaction prod-
ucts from the nanotube mesopores. It was, therefore, concluded that
the blends of E-CAT and halloysite nanotubes represented an
improved catalyst for the mixtures of heavy petroleum distillates

56

S. Bezergianni et al. / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 68 (2018) 29(cid:1)64

and vegetable oils which ensured the increase of aromatic content
and the gasoline octane number rating by two units.

Moreover, studies on the possible relationships between the cat-
alyst structure (nature and composition of the catalysts) and the co-
processing performances are also known. Fogassy et al. [55] investi-
gated the effect of the catalyst structure on the quality of the prod-
ucts formed by the co-processing of HPO with VGO. They performed
a detailed mechanistic study on the possibility of biofuel production
by co-processing in comparison with pure vacuum gas oil (VGO)
processing using three different porous materials containing micro-
pores and/or mesopores, FCC, HY and HZSM-5. The structure of the
zeolites, in terms of pore size and Si/Al ratio (unit cell size), was
found to influence the catalytic cracking reactions both for the VGO
and for the VGO/HPO feed and thus to affect the conversion level
and the product distribution. It was suggested that VGO/HPO co-
processing leads to lower product formation rates than the process-
ing of VGO alone, except for the coke formation and the formation of
more unsaturated components (essentially aromatics). The data for
both VGO cracking and co-processing followed the published trends
with acid site density. These results were explained by the restricted
access of the oxygenated compounds from HDO, like the heaviest
VGO molecules, into the zeolite pores. Therefore, pre-cracking and
deoxygenation (dehydroxylation and decarbonylation) occurred on
the extra-framework structure (silica(cid:1)alumina matrix or EFAL
deposits for steamed samples). This process resulted in coke forma-
tion; indeed, due to their polar nature and fully accessible basic oxy-
gen electronic doublet, the oxygenated compounds originating from
the HPO adsorb much more strongly on the active sites (Brùnsted
and Lewis acid sites) than the less polar hydrocarbons [138]. This
excessive coke formation led to pore blocking and lower reaction
rates. Another key mechanistic feature explaining the observed
effects of co-processing on the product quality was the competition
for hydrogen (protons or hydrides) through the zeolite interface,
required by the oxygenates cracking process. This resulted in an
increase in olefins and aromatics as well as the LPG fraction and
more bottom and coke formation. Based on these findings, the
authors suggested the existence of a high interest to tune the zeolite
structural parameters in order (i) to increase the methoxy-phenol
conversion and (ii) to decrease the coke deposition from oxygenates.

5. Product quality

As the hydroprocessing of lipids renders a paraffinic fuel, it is
obvious that an increase in the bio-based content in the blend results
in lower densities of the final hybrid fuel as a part of the produced
hydrocarbons are paraffins with low density [37, 81]. During the co-
hydroprocessing of straight run gas oil (SRGO), light cycle oil (LCO)
and animal fats, the addition of LCO to SRGO increases the density
because of its high aromatic content, but the addition of waste fat
offsets that [4]. Obviously, the density of the hybrid products was
reduced as an effect of the triglyceride conversion and the aromatics
saturation. In general, lipids transformed mainly in the C15(cid:1)C18 n-
alkanes and their densities are much lower (740(cid:1)770 kg/m3) com-
pared to conventional diesel fuels [35].

As far as the effect of triglycerides on the sulfur content of the
final product is concerned, the effect is not yet clear. Some studies
claim that the sulfur content of the organic product decreased with
the addition of a bio-based feedstock. As lipid-based feeds are virtu-
ally sulfur free, their addition results in lower sulfur content of the
blend which may be responsible for lowering of the sulfur content in
the liquid products, typically diesel. Baladincz and Hancsok [37]
found that during co-hydroprocessing, the triglyceride content is
converted to paraffins and the sulfur, nitrogen and oxygen content
of the feedstock are decreased. Bezergianni et al. [45] noticed that
HDS reactions are not affected by the addition of waste cooking oil
in the feedstock which is in agreement with the results of Huber

et al. [30] who claimed that the hydrotreating of vegetable oil and
HDS probably occurs on different catalytic sites that were, however,
not specified. On the other hand, according to Toth et al. [29], oxygen
containing compounds (triglycerides, other oxygen containing prod-
ucts) bind strongly to the active sites of the desulfurization catalyst
and hence limit the desulfurization reactions. Consequently, when
higher vegetable oil contents were used, the sulfur content in the
products increased. An amount of vegetable oil higher than 15%
reduced the desulphurization efficiency, indicating that the removal
of both heteroatoms (S and O) took place on the same active sites of
the catalyst. Hence, the deoxygenation reactions restricted the
desulphurization reactions because of the intake of large quantities
of oxygen with the triglyceride molecule of the vegetable oil [139].

Another important property of the resulting middle distillate that
is affected by the lipid content in the co-processing feed is the CFPP
(cold filter plugging point). The higher the lipid content, the higher
the CFPP, due to the paraffinic nature of the hybrid fuel [29]. As nor-
mal paraffins have a high melting point, their presence in the diesel
fuel negatively affects the CFPP, which is a critical parameter for
winter operability. During the co-hydroprocessing of waste animal
grease and LCO, a positive correlation was observed between the
CFPP value of the product and the content of the grease in the feed
[41]. According to Toth et al. [81], only the products derived from
less than 10% rapeseed oil containing feedstocks were able to meet
the European standard for summer quality diesel fuel in temperate
zones (EN 590). Balandincz and Hanscok proposed the addition of an
isomerization step to improve the CFPP properties of the final prod-
uct [37]. The problem of poor cold flow properties can also be tack-
led using proper ‘‘cold flow improvers’’ for decreasing the size of the
wax crystallites, during the cooling of the fuel or inhibiting the wax
formation starting [45]. However, it has been reported that the con-
ventional commercial cold flow improvers are inefficient when the
content of bio-derived paraffins exceeds 10% [140].

The total aromatics content of the final products decreased com-
pared to that of the petroleum feedstocks because the lipid-based
feeds are aromatics free [4, 81]. Furthermore, during the co-hydro-
processing of gas oil with triglyceride feedstocks, the aromatics and
PAH content decreases in comparison with gas oil feed only due to
the transformation of triglycerides to alkanes [35]. This gives the
advantage to refineries to produce lower aromatic products, which
will be more and more valuable if the future regulations will con-
tinue becoming stricter and yet a lower limit for total aromatics in
diesel fuel will be imposed.

In addition, paraffins, originating from the deoxygenation of the
lipids in the feed, increase the cetane number/index of the fuel [36,
37], as long chain paraffins have the best ignition quality characteris-
tics between the hydrocarbons. According to experiments by Chen
et al. [38], the cetane index of the corresponding diesel fraction from
hydrocracking of heavy vacuum gas oil was 40 and it increased to 55
when a blend containing 20% of canola oil was upgraded, improving
the quality of the diesel product in this way.

As far as kinematic viscosity is concerned, it decreased with an
increasing temperature and pressure, due to the triglyceride conver-
sion, the aromatics saturation and cracking reactions [37]. Further-
more, an increase in the products’ viscosity was also observed with
the increase in the concentration of the triglycerides in the feedstock
[81]. This happens because a higher triglyceride containing feed-
stock crates more viscous n-paraffins.

Being glyceryl esters of fatty acids (triglycerides), lipids contain a
significant concentration of chemically-bound oxygen (10(cid:1)14%).
The oxygen moiety reacts under normal hydrotreating conditions
with hydrogen to form water or is released as CO2. If water is formed
in large quantities it may adversely affect the catalyst by weakening
it, or may cause a redistribution in the active metals and loss of sur-
face area due to phase transformation of the support. However, at
blending ratios up to 10%, the oxygen content is below 1.5 wt% and,

thus, it is unlikely to form enough water to cause significant prob-
lems.

Studies have shown that the addition of lipid-based feeds into an
existing refinery improve the product quality [45]. Co-hydroprocess-
ing is a key technology to produce high quality hybrid fuels that
meet fuel specifications. A very important issue is the selection of
the appropriate catalyst or a combination of catalysts to ensure
petroleum grade HDS at the requested level below 10 ppm and, also,
to be able to transform triglycerides to hydrocarbons. Hydroprocess-
ing of lipid feedstocks converts triglycerides into normal paraffins.
As a result, in the case of co-hydroprocessing, the increase of lipid
content results in higher paraffinic content in the final product. This
leads to a final product with a higher cetane number and heating
value which improves the combustion efficiency of the engines.
However, if the content of lipids is too high, then problems with cold
flow properties will occur. Table 9 presents the properties of hybrid
fuels from various studies.

Aromatic and naphthenic hydrocarbons, together with both
linear and branched paraffins and olefins, are the main products
of the FCC of petroleum fractions. Since in the co-processing of
petroleum-derived and bio-derived feedstocks,
the resulting
feedstock mixture mostly consists of the former component, the
quality of the produced gasoline and diesel fractions are mostly
determined by the characteristics of the petroleum feed and
reaction conditions. Nevertheless, the presence of oxygen atoms
and unsaturated bonds in the bio-based feedstock affect the
cracking process as well as the hydrogen consumption through
hydrogen transfer reactions.

The fraction of aromatic hydrocarbons and polar aromatics (large
molecular phenols and aromatic acids) in the FPO are considered as
the primary sources for the formation of aromatic hydrocarbons dur-
ing the bio-oil co-feeding with a petroleum distillate [99]. The com-
position of bio-gasoline produced during the FCC co-processing of
LCO and FPO in a MAT unit was compared to that of an ordinary FCC
gasoline. The main differences consisted in the lower amount of ole-
fins and naphthenes, while the content of the total aromatics, espe-
cially toluene, was higher when co-processing FPO. It contributed to
a rise in the RON from 92.2 for an ordinary FCC gasoline to 95.8 for a
bio-gasoline. Consequently, it was suggested [99] that the composi-
tion of the bio-gasoline produced by the FCC co-processing of FPO
was compatible with the EU specifications for an environmentally
acceptable gasoline.

Pinho et al. [53] investigated the properties of a gasoline fraction
produced by co-processing of VGO and FPO in a demonstration-scale
FCC unit in detail. The benzene and total aromatics concentration
increased from 0.8 to 1.4 and from 38 to 44 wt%, correspondingly,
when increasing the content of VGO from 67% to 74%. Nevertheless,
heavy cracked naphtha (HCN, 80(cid:1)220 °C) produced from a blend
containing 20% of bio-oil contained more aromatics than that pro-
duced from neat VGO (53.8 wt% and 50 wt%, respectively). Conse-
quently, the octane numbers of the HCN cuts increased when the
FPO was added to the VGO as a co-feed from 83.3 to 84.4 (MON) and
from 95.8 to 96.5 (RON). Phenol and alkylphenols were identified
and quantified in gasoline derived from the co-processing of VGO
and FPO by ion chromatography. Nevertheless, it was suggested that
the presence of these compounds might only be barely harmful to
the gasoline quality because the phenolics are traditionally believed
to stabilize the cracked gasoline and increase its octane number
[53].

Bielansky et al. [51, 64] found that liquid products formed
during the FCC co-processing of VGO with rapeseed oil in all
ranges of feedstock compositions (0(cid:1)100%) were practically oxy-
gen free while water and carbon dioxide were the only oxygen-
contained by-products of the RSO cracking. The analysis of the
gasoline range of the pure VGO and pure rapeseed oil feedstocks
showed that the content of the aromatics and olefinic naph-
thenes increased while the naphthenes, n-olefins and i-paraffins
declined. The increase in the RSO content in the feedstock was
accompanied by an increase in the RON and MON up to approxi-
mately 100 and 86, respectively, reported for the neat rapeseed-
oil-derived gasoline. Moreover, the oxidation stability increased
at higher rapeseed oil admixtures, and a necessary value of 360
according to EN228 could be reached without any further refine-
ment steps with RSO rich blends.

6. Sustainability

6.1. Co-hydroprocessing

The current biofuels market has become much more transparent
in comparison to its early stages. Until 2020 the key production and
consumption region of biodiesel will be the European market. There
are many benefits of biofuels including domestic production of fuels,
decreased greenhouse gas emissions, decreased dependence on

fossil fuels, improvement of rural economies and increased national
security [4, 80].

The conventional HVO investment and operating costs involving
the stand-alone hydrotreating of lipid feedstocks have been reported
to be about 50% lower than the FAME costs by some [141, 142] while
others have reported the costs to be comparable with those of FAME
installations of the first generation biodiesel technologies [11, 143,
144] depending on the feedstock costs and by-product revenues.
The corresponding hydroprocessing by-product, propane, is not so
versatile and may not reduce the cost of HVO much. However, the
cost of the catalytic hydroprocessing can be reduced by locating the
plant at an existing petroleum refinery [142, 145]. Based on the
same study, according to petroleum refineries, the modification cost
of an existing hydrotreating unit to produce HVO is small, lowering
the overall cost of the technology in this way. Another important
aspect of HVO is that stand-alone hydroprocessing of lipids requires
a two-stage process, consisting of mild-hydrotreating followed by
an isomerization stage [146(cid:1)148] leading to a high operating cost
mainly due to the requirements for the hydroprocessing catalyst and
hydrogen. Furthermore, by using a residual lipid-based feedstock
such as waste cooking oil or animal fats, the production costs of the
final diesel product (including 7% v/v HVO biofuel) reduce compared
to the current market diesel scenario where diesel fuel contains 7%
v/v FAME biodiesel. This is obvious as the production cost of the
HVO biofuel from waste cooking oils is lower than that of FAME
from fresh oils. In addition to that, the costs of the hydroprocessing
lipid feedstocks are in some studies stipulated to be about 50% of the
transesterification processing costs [141, 142]. Moreover, the use of
residual biomass further reduces the production costs of the final
diesel blend as according to the Directive 2009/28/EC, residual bio-
mass feeds are eligible for double counting [149]. For instance, 3.5%
v/v HVO (from residual lipids) counts as 7% v/v biofuel in the final
diesel blend reducing the cost of the final market diesel in that way.
In addition to that, methane which is a by-product of stand-alone
hydroprocessing is a valuable gas that can also be sold on the market
increasing the profits of the refinery, while propane, which is also a
by-product of the process, can be processed by steam reforming to
cover a part of the extra hydrogen needs for hydroprocessing of lip-
ids. Finally the possibility of integrating H2 from renewable energy
sources could possibly further diminish the production cost of
stand-alone hydroprocessing [150]. However, the high investment
cost for new constructions makes this technology profitable only for
large scale production. Finally, another important issue that raises
the production cost of HVO is the transportation cost of feedstock
which can be faced by constructing the unit close to feedstock pro-
vider companies [26].

The economic limitations of stand-alone hydroprocessing bio-
based feedstock can be overcome via co-hydroprocessing of lipid-
based feeds with petroleum fractions. This approach enables the use
of existing refinery infrastructure, maintaining the same operating
conditions, producing the same quality products and avoiding the
establishment of parallel systems, which reduce capital and operat-
ing expenditures (CAPEX and OPEX, respectively) [30, 106]. The
more beneficial option from an economic point of view is to add a
small amount of lipid-based feedstock in an existing petroleum
refinery for co-hydroprocessing with a fossil stream as shown in Fig.
2. This would allow the refineries to meet national mandates on bio-
fuels. The final product is already in the diesel, gasoline, jet range,
etc. with very good properties as was discussed in Section 5.

However, the addition of lipid-based feeds into a refinery results
in an increase of hydrogen consumption. For example, Jatropha oil
has an oxygen content 10(cid:1)11 wt%, on the other hand, straight run
diesel (LAGO) fraction has a sulfur content 0.5(cid:1)2 wt%. According to a
recent study [33], when adding Jatropha oil to LAGO fraction, the
amount of oxygen introduced to the catalyst was higher than the
decrease in sulfur content in the feed. As a result, to remove oxygen

and sulfur as H2O and H2S,
the hydrogen consumption was
increased. Furthermore, the hydrogen consumption also depends on
the type of lipids, highly saturated fatty feedstock sources (such as
tallow and palm oil) that require less hydrogen than more unsatu-
rated feedstock options (such as rapeseed) [144]. Consequently, the
careful choice of lipid feedstock could result in lower hydrogen
demands. The hydrogen consumption is an important issue from an
industrial point of view; a process with lower hydrogen demands
would be more economical. It may be possible for a typical diesel
hydrotreater to easily co-process low amounts of lipid-based feeds
(10%) with their existing conditions with a nominal increase in
hydrogen consumption [48], for example, the addition of 5(cid:1)10% of
WCO increased hydrogen consumption by just 6.25% (Fig. 3), indicat-
ing that WCO integration up to 10% can be achieved without signifi-
cant operating cost increase [45]. Another possible way to decrease
hydrogen consumption is by selecting a more appropriate catalyst.
From the reaction stoichiometry point of view (Fig. 4), hydrodeoxy-
genation is more hydrogen-demanding (ca. 4 times more) than
decarboxylation/decarbonylation reactions, as hydrodeoxygenation
is more favored over the NiMo catalyst than over NiW catalyst, the
use of NiW catalyst seems to be a better choice for reducing the
hydrogen consumption during co-hydroprocessing [72]. Nonethe-
less, this is true only when the consecutive reduction of CO2 to meth-
ane can be avoided.
If not, the decarboxylation pathway with
complete the CO2 reduction to methane and would consume more
H2 than the hydrodeoxygenation route [101, 111]. In addition to the
catalyst choice, hydrodeoxygenation/decarboxylation selectivity can
be affected by reaction conditions, most notably hydrogen pressure
[151]. Furthermore, Kalnes et al. [11] mention that fossil energy use
in HVO production can be reduced by producing H2 from by-prod-
ucts like propane.

Another advantage of co-hydroprocessing is the reduction of pro-
duction cost when waste lipids are used. The addition of 5(cid:1)10%
waste cooking oil or waste animal fats into the refinery leads to high
economic benefits for the refinery. The cost of waste cooking oil or
waste animal fats is much lower compared to the cost of fossil fuel
and FAME biodiesel. Thus, by replacing 5(cid:1)10% of fossil fuel or FAME
biodiesel content with waste cooking oil the economic benefits of
the refinery increased proportionally with the waste bio-content
[152]. In addition to that, as it was already discussed in a previous
section, straight run gas oil with light cycle oil, which is a low-qual-
ity fossil feed, in blends with lipid-based feedstocks can be co-proc-
essed. In this way, saving of crude oil could be reached with the
increased use of LCO for diesel fuel production instead of straight
run gas oil which is used for automotive fuels. As a result, more auto-
motive fuels can be produced from straight run gas oil [4].

Due to the increased hydrogen consumption in co-processing,
different hydrogen resources have to be carefully considered. Con-
sidering the overall sustainability, renewable resources should be
preferred. A possibility that is easy to implement even in the current
refineries is the steam reforming of propane and methane formed
during co-hydroprocessing [153, 154]. A promising hydrogen pro-
duction route might be the aqueous phase reforming relying typi-
cally on carbohydrate solutions originating, e.g., from the processing
of lignocellulosic biomass or by-products such as glycerol from other
processes [155-158]. Sugar concentrations of up to 60% were used
and an efficiency (defined as lower heating value of the produced
hydrogen divided by the lower heating value of the feedstock)
of > 55% was achieved [156]. Catalyst stability and moderate space-
time yields still need to be further improved [156]. Moreover,
according to a research project in Greece “Biofuels 2G” [150],
another possibility to reduce the cost of the process is to use solar
hydrogen to cover the extra hydrogen needed for co-hydroprocess-
ing. This technique has an extra investment cost for a solar hydrogen
production unit which, however, has a good pay-back time and
could decrease the overall cost of the process [152]. Finally,

increased hydrogen demands for co-processing are less important
for some refineries that have excess hydrogen produced by natural
gas steam reforming. To conclude, the role of lipids is not to totally
replace the fossil fuels, but only part of them as sustainably available
lipids are not abundant enough. Consequently, the extra H2 demands
for their co-hydroprocessing are not so high and can be covered with
the methods described above.

The increased hydrogen consumption due to co-processing is
closely related to the blending ratio. While the reports show that
hydrotreating feeds containing up to 30% of lipids is technologically
feasible, the availability of a suitable, i.e., sustainably obtained, bio-
mass has to be kept in mind. Unlike fossil fuels, a biomass is typically
a seasonal product, and hence it is not a simple question of absolute
amounts available, but also of the time when it is available. As aver-
age refinery hydrotreating capacity exceeds 30 thousand barrels per
day [159], only low continuous blending ratios, i.e., < 5% of bio-com-
ponents in fossil fuel fractions, seem to be realistic. Due to the sea-
sonal aspects, higher temporary blending ratios could be, however,
expected.

Finally, there are some technological and market challenges in
biofuels production that remain, however, they are not insurmount-
able. The most important is the storage and handling of the feed-
stock due to lower thermal and oxidation stability of lipids and bio-
oils. The corrosion of the process equipment and the poisoning of
the catalyst due to corrosive properties and impurities (such as alkali
metals) of bio-based feedstock and the higher cost of biomass in a
period of low crude oil prices make biofuels less competitive [160].

In general, by comparing the two alternatives, i.e., stand-alone
HVO production with co-processing of lipid-based feedstocks with
petroleum fractions, it is obvious that the second approach is eco-
nomically more attractive. This is a consequence of investment cost
being very small as there are no requirements for a new unit con-
struction as in the case of “stand alone” processes. Hence, the profits
for a refinery might be substantial.

From a biomass availability point of view, the main challenge is
how to supply the necessary quantities to a refinery. Other chal-
lenges include the seasonal and geographical variation of the bio-
mass feedstock composition and properties and the establishment
of suitable transportation chains. These issues can be addressed by
locating low-capacity biorefineries close to biomass-producing
areas, thus reducing the transportation cost. Another possible option
is to create temporary storage biomass facilities before the transpor-
tation to the refineries. In general, there are some studies that have
developed mathematical models aimed at building an efficient logis-
tic system [161(cid:1)163].

As far as GHG emissions are concerned, the use of lipids for co-
processing results in lower GHG emissions compared to pure fossil
hydroprocessing [152] However, GHG emissions reduction depends
on the source of lipids. More specifically, waste feedstock sources
are better than native feedstock because of the smaller upstream
impacts. Waste cooking oils have low energy demand which is
related to the collection of the oils and pretreatment. Regarding tall
oil, it was concluded by Tornvall et al. [164] that it is preferable from
an environmental point of view instead of rapeseed in an energy and
GHG perspective. According to Sunde et al. [144], tall oil is the most
feasible feedstock, followed by used vegetable or cooking oil. Tall oil
is a byproduct or waste from the main process of pulp production,
for this reason it only carries the environmental loads related to the
treatment of black liquor. Palm oil is cultivated with best practice on
fallow or degraded land without soil losses, due to its high yields; it
has favorable environmental profile compared to other vegetable
oils [165]. Rapeseed oil may, however, perform better in cases where
palm oil production is related to high soil carbon emissions or when
the palm oil production processes are not environmentally opti-
mized. The rapid increase in demand for palm oil has resulted in the
clearing of rainforests to establish palm oil plantations with

ecological impacts due to loss of rainforest biodiversity and pollution
[166]. The clearing of rainforests or usage of peaty soil for palm oil
production may create large soil carbon debts that may take decades
to pay off [167, 168]. It is obvious that there are many aspects that
influence the GHG emissions when the co-processing of lipid based
with fossil-based feedstocks takes place. To conclude, a recent study
from California Air Resources Board [160] proposes options for the
quantification of low-carbon fuel mass/volume and for estimation of
carbon intensities for fuels produced through co-processing. This
study presents a preliminary framework and methods for estimating
low-carbon fuel content of co-processed fuels for consideration and
feedback from stakeholders.

6.2. FCC co-processing

this purpose,

When evaluating the concept of co-processing bio-oil with petro-
leum fractions in FCC units, it is important to not only consider the
quantitative parameters (reaction conditions, the overall conversion,
the yield of different fractions) and the qualitative evaluation of
products composition and properties, but also to get an understand-
ing on the amount of renewable carbon that is being effectively con-
the 14C
centrated in the liquid fractions. For
(renewable carbon) concentration is determined by accelerator
mass spectrometry combined with isotope ratio mass spectrometry
[53, 54, 56]. Fossil fuels are virtually 14C-free, while bio-oil contains
the present-day “natural” amount of 14C. Fogassy et al. [56] showed
that an initial 8.5 wt% bio-carbon content of the initial mixed feed
composed of HPO (10 wt%) and VGO (90 wt%) was not statistically
distributed among the products. Thus, the gas and especially the
coke fractions contained significantly more bio-carbon than
expected from the statistical distribution (10.6 wt% and 15.8 wt%,
respectively). In contrast, the total liquid fraction (including the
unreacted feed) a bio-carbon content lower than the initial feed con-
tent (7.5 wt%). After correction for the unconverted liquid fraction,
which represents the LCO and bottom fraction, and assuming these
fractions still contained the initial 8.5 wt% of bio-carbon, the content
of the renewable carbon in the liquid product, gasoline, was even
lower, about 7.2 wt%. Similar results were also obtained by Wang
et al. [54] in the study of co-processing of CPO with VGO. The authors
found that the renewable carbon in the gasoline product was about
7 wt%, while the bio-carbon in LCO fraction was slightly higher
(7.3 wt%). The difference was explained by the increased polyaro-
matics content in the latter fraction.

Pinho et al. [53] pointed out that when 20% FPO was co-processed
with a petroleum fraction, the renewable carbon content in the gaso-
line cuts varied between 3 and 5 wt%, whereas the biocarbon in the
heavier cuts, i.e., the LCO and bottoms, was 5 and 6 wt%, respectively.
For 10 wt% FPO in the feed, 2 wt% renewable carbon were obtained
in the total liquid product. Considering that the carbon content in
the FPO was 42.35 wt%, the catalytic cracking produced a liquid
effluent with approximately one-third of the renewable carbon pres-
ent in the bio-oil. The same result was obtained using either 10% bio-
oil or 20% bio-oil, i.e., approximately one-third of the renewable car-
bon (on weight basis) present in the bio-oil was preserved in the liq-
uid effluent. Recent results of the same authors [130] provided
further evidence that for a similar reference feed (VGO), FCC condi-
tions, and bio-oil origin approximately one-third of the renewable
carbon from the bio-oil ends up in the liquid products for a bio-oil
usage between 5 wt% up to 20 wt%. Like in co-hydroprocessing, large
industrial FCC installations with an average capacity of nearly 40
thousand barrels per day [159], combined with the local biomass
availability will not allow such large blending ratios on a continuous
basis. Hence, less than 5% of bio-components in the feedstocks seem
to be attainable on a continuous basis.

Research activities related to the co-processing of petroleum-
derived and biomass-derived feedstocks under FCC conditions is a

new area having a big potential to grow. The production of renew-
able fuels may be driven by several forces, including the unpredict-
able change of petroleum prices, governmental mandates and
subsidies as well as commitments to Green House Gas reduction.
Despite these incentives, current growth in the production of renew-
able fuels marginally meets expectations; moreover, little integra-
tion of renewable fuels with petroleum refineries is observed [169].
This increases the cost of production, since it does not take advan-
tage of any existing infrastructure for the production and distribu-
tion of fuels. No doubt that additional economic prerequisites have
to be created for the intensification of biofuel production in existing
oil refineries.

The broad availability and low cost of biomass-derived feedstock
are essential prerequisites for the economic efficiency and, conse-
quently, the successful development of renewable fuel technologies.
In this respect, the production of vegetable oil worldwide is very
promising: it is constantly increasing and exceeded 185 million met-
ric tons in 2016/2017 [170]. Mostly, vegetable oils are used in the
food sector. Nevertheless, the global consumption of major vegeta-
ble oils (food versus industrial uses) can vary significantly and
depends on the type of vegetable oil. Olive, sunflower, cottonseed
oils are predominantly used in the food sector while palm kernel oil
is mostly used in industrial applications, and coconut, rapeseed and
soybean oils occupy an intermediate position [171]. Due to the sig-
nificant consumption of vegetable oils in the food sector they could
only replace a very small fraction of transportation fuels. Neverthe-
less, the ever-increasing demand for biofuels has a significant effect
on the ratio between the food and industrial uses of vegetable oils.
In turn, the necessity to increase the involvement of vegetable oils in
the production of biofuels affects the cost of vegetable oils. In gen-
eral, there is a good correlation between the price of vegetable oils
and crude oil, which began to be noticeable about 10 years ago.
The prices of energy and agriculture products are interrelated for
two main reasons [172, 173]. Firstly, they are related via produc-
tion costs as many agricultural products are energy intensive
due to the high energy content of the fertilizers and other chem-
icals used and due to the high costs of harvesting and transport
relative to the value of production. Secondly, they are related via
substitution with biofuel varieties. According to Mitchell [173],
biodiesel was responsible for approximately one-third of the
increase in vegetable oil consumption in 2004(cid:1)2007. In recent
years,
of
0.45(cid:1)0.65 USD/l [169, 174] being higher than the current price
for crude oil in the range of 0.3(cid:1)0.4 USD/l. Based on these val-
ues, a conclusion is made that at current prices of vegetable oils
it is not
and the limited availability of this kind of biomass,
attractive for producing biofuels without government subsidies
[169].

Lignocellulosic biomass has a major advantage over vegetable
oils in its larger availability and lower cost. Globally, more than
90% of plant biomass consists of lignocellulose and amounts to
about 200 £ 109 metric tons/year, among which 4(cid:1)10% has an
immense potential for biofuel generation [175]. Several studies
reported the cost of producing bio-oil via fast pyrolysis to range
between 0.11 and 0.65 USD per liter [176(cid:1)179]. The broad avail-
ability of a lignocellulosic biomass and the low cost of its trans-
formation to FPO makes this feedstock potentially attractive for
its FCC co-processing with petroleum fractions. Nevertheless, it
is assumed that FPO processing requires more commercial devel-
opment and is also limited by the availability of pyrolysis oil,
since commercially it is still
in its infancy. In the long term,
however, the focus must be on the effective utilization of cellu-
losic biomass [169]. It is worth noting that a lack of information
is available on the cost of FPO upgrading to produce more stable
and less oxygenated bio-oils, for example, by a hydrogenation

step. Moreover, several other issues may affect the economic and
operational viability of co-processing [180]:

(cid:4) Differences in the stability of the biogenic feedstocks during

storage and handling.

(cid:4) The presence of water and oxygenated organic compounds in
the biogenic feedstocks which can cause equipment corrosion
and can affect yields and conversion rates.

(cid:4) The potential for alkali metals in biogenic feedstocks to deacti-

vate catalysts.

(cid:4) Differences in yields between pilot and commercial scale proj-

ects.
Some of these problems can be mitigated based on findings from
ongoing research and development activities. These can be carried
out by using equipment varied in size, as shown in the previous sec-
tions. Accordingly, the obtained results being used for the feasibility
studies may vary in dependence on the capacity of an experimental
unit. Therefore, despite the successes in the co-processing of bio-
derived and petroleum-derived feedstocks in a demonstration scale
FCC riser reactor [130], more experimental data is needed for further
optimization of the whole process.

7. Conclusions

The current biofuels market has become more transparent in
comparison to their early stages. There are many benefits of biofuels
including the domestic production of fuels, decreased greenhouse
gas emissions, decreased dependence on fossil fuels, improvement
of rural economies and increased national security. The co-process-
ing approach enables the use of the existing refinery infrastructure
while maintaining the nominal operating conditions, producing high
quality products and avoiding the establishment of parallel systems,
which consecutively reduces CAPEX and OPEX. The more beneficial
option from an economic point of view is to add a small amount of
bio-based feedstock in an existing petroleum refinery for co-proc-
essing with a fossil stream. This would allow the refineries to meet
national mandates on biofuels. One of the main advantages of co-
processing is the ability to combine a variety of bio- and fossil-based
feedstocks/fractions without compromising product quality. More-
over, fossil resources are saved because of co-processing that can be
used in other processes. There are two main technologies that could
be used for co-processing of biomass feedstock with petroleum frac-
tions, the first one is catalytic hydroprocessing and the second one is
fluid catalytic cracking (FCC). Both technologies are found in virtu-
ally any conventional refinery.

The most commonly used fossil-based feeds for co-processing are
straight-run gas oil (SRGO), light atmospheric gas oil (LAGO), heavy
atmospheric gas oil (HAGO) and heavy vacuum gas oil (HVGO). The
fossil-based FCC feedstocks suitable also for co-processing applica-
tions include distillate fractions, such as vacuum- and heavy vacuum
gas-oils or FCC cycle oils, as well as atmospheric distillation residues.
Triglycerides present in vegetable oils, waste oils or animal fats are
characterized as a suitable raw material for high quality fuels pro-
duction. The most common edible oils for co-hydroprocessing are
palm oil, rapeseed oil, soybean oil, sunflower oil, while Jatropha oil
is the most common non-edible oil. As far as residual feedstocks are
concerned, several types have been studied such as used cooking
oils/waste cooking oils, waste soya oil, waste vegetable oils and ani-
mal greases. In addition to lipids, bio-oil has been recently been con-
sidered as a promising alternative bio-based feedstock due to its
favorable origin from non-food biomass. In general, bio-oil can be
obtained by fast heating of a solid biomass, typically a lignocellulosic
biomass including wood, forestry and agricultural residues.

The most important factors of co-hydroprocessing are operating
i.e., reaction pressure, reaction temperature, space

conditions,

61

velocity and hydrogen-to-oil ratio, and catalyst. It may be possible
for a typical diesel hydrotreater to easily co-hydroprocess low per-
centages of lipid-based feeds (< 10%) under nominal conditions with
only a marginal increase in hydrogen consumption. Catalysts used in
the co-hydroprocessing with lipids are common hydrotreating cata-
lysts based on cobalt-molybdenum (CoMo) and nickel-molybdenum
(NiMo). Other types are NiW catalysts while the effect of zeolite beta
(BEA) content in NiMo catalyst has also been explored. Finally,
another approach is to combine various compositions of hydrogena-
tion catalysts in the catalyst bed. Unfortunately, there is a lack of lit-
erature in the co-hydroprocessing of pyrolysis bio-oil with fossil-
based feedstocks. The most commonly used catalysts for the co-
hydroprocessing of pyrolysis bio-oil with fossil-based feedstocks up
to now are CoMo/Al2O3 and NiMo/Al2O3, however, further studies
with different types of catalysts should be undertaken in the future
to better understand the effect of catalyst type on the extent of HDO
and HDS reactions.

Furthermore, studies have shown that the addition of lipid-
based feeds into an existing refinery improves the product qual-
ity. Co-hydroprocessing is a key technology to produce high
quality hybrid fuels that meet fuel specifications. Another advan-
tage is the reduction of the production cost when waste lipids
are used. The addition of 5(cid:1)10% waste cooking oil or waste ani-
mal fats into the refinery leads to high economic benefits for the
refinery. As far as GHG emissions are concerned, the use of lipids
results in lower GHG emissions compared to pure fossil hydro-
processing. Nonetheless, it has to be kept in mind that co-proc-
essing results in an increased H2 consumption in comparison
with the hydrotreatment of fossil fractions.

Considering FCC co-processing, processes that take place in the
FCC reactor are based on several types of reactions, including (proto-
lytic) cracking, hydrogen transfer, and isomerization. The same reac-
tions should apparently occur in the case of the co-processing of
petroleum and bio-based feedstocks. When evaluating the concept
of co-processing bio-oil with petroleum fractions in FCC units, it is
important to consider not only the quantitative parameters (reaction
conditions, the overall conversion, the yield of different fractions)
and the qualitative evaluation of products composition and proper-
ties, but also to get an understanding on the amount of renewable
carbon that is being effectively concentrated in the liquid fractions.
Research activities related to the co-processing of petroleum-
derived and biomass-derived feedstocks under FCC conditions is a
new area having a big potential to grow.

Different bio-oils (HPO as well as CPO and FPO) may be consid-
ered as promising bio-additives to petroleum-derived feedstocks for
FCC co-processing. Nevertheless, considering results from different
studies, it is difficult to evaluate the efficiency of different bio-oils as
a bio-additive in the co-processing and to make any conclusion
about the influence of the type of bio-oil on the co-processing char-
acteristics because of the differences in the properties of the bio-oils,
reaction conditions, etc. Hence, publications dealing with compara-
tive studies on the co-processing of differently prepared bio-oils
with petroleum feeds at similar conditions are of an increased
interest.

Today, petroleum refineries already have a well-developed infra-
structure to produce fuels and base chemicals and, consequently,
would not require additional intensive investments for the process-
ing of alternative feedstocks. In general, co-processing either via
hydroprocessing or FCC-processing is a very promising technique to
integrate bio-based feedstocks in a petroleum refinery for hybrid
fuels production, which in some cases already has found its practical
realization. The benefits for a refinery are plenty, not only in reduc-
ing the associated GHG emissions, but also in enabling the gradual
independence from fossil sources, rendering low-carbon-highly-
sustainable fuels.
