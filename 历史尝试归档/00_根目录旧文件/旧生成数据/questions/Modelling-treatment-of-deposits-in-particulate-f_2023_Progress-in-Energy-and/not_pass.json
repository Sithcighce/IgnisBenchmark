    "question_text": "Explain the concept of the 'percolation constant' (ψ) in the unit collector model for the transition from deep bed filtration to soot cake formation. Derive mathematically how the partition coefficient Φ (Eq. 57 or 58) depends on ψ. Discuss how the value of ψ affects the predicted pressure drop during loading (refer to Fig. 9). How is this constant typically determined, and what are the limitations of this approach for predictive modeling across different filter designs and operating conditions.",
    "standard_answer": "The percolation constant ψ controls the onset of pure soot cake formation in the unit collector model. The partition coefficient Φ determines the fraction of filtered particles that deposit within the wall versus on the cake. For models using Eq. (57): Φ = (d_c,interface² - d_c0²) / ((ψ d_c,max)² - d_c0²) for spherical collectors. The maximum collector diameter d_c,max is related to the clean wall porosity ε0 by d_c,max³ = d_c0³ / (1 - ε0). The partition coefficient approaches 1 when the collector diameter at the interface reaches ψ d_c,max. If ψ is increased, the transition to soot cake formation occurs later (at higher soot load), allowing more soot to deposit within the wall during deep bed filtration. From Eq. (57), as ψ increases, the denominator increases, so Φ increases more slowly with in-wall soot load. This means that for a higher ψ, the filter remains in the deep bed regime longer, leading to a higher pressure drop at the same total soot mass compared to a lower ψ. This is because deep bed deposition reduces wall permeability more significantly than cake deposition for the same mass. Therefore, during the loading process before cake formation, the pressure drop rises more steeply. The constant ψ is usually calibrated to match experimental pressure drop data for a specific filter and condition. This is a major limitation: ψ is not a fundamental property but an empirical fitting parameter that can vary greatly between experiments. It lacks a clear physical correlation with filter properties, flow conditions, or particle characteristics. Its value may also depend on the spatial discretisation of the wall (n_wall). This limits the predictive power of the model when applied to different filters (e.g., different materials, pore sizes). For predictive capability, a correlation for ψ in terms of relevant dimensionless groups (e.g., wall Peclet number). Future work should develop such a correlation to improve model applicability across a wider range of particulate filters. Without this, the model is only valid for the calibrated dataset and cannot extrapolate reliably.",
