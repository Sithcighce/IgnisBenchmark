Combustion aerosol technology has distinct advantages for the assembly of chemoresistive gas sensors compared 
to  their  traditional  wet  chemistry  synthesis.  These  advantages  are  traced  to  combustion’s  steep  temperature 
gradients  and  high  particle  concentrations  during  sensing  particle  formation  and  film  deposition.  This  gives 
direct access to a plethora of material compositions (e.g. metastable phases, solid solutions, mixed oxides) and 
fractal-like porous but rigid structures that can lead to unique sensor selectivity, sensitivity and stability along 
with  short  response  and  recovery  times.  Here,  flame-made  gas  sensors  are  reviewed  tutorially and  compared 
quantitatively. First, their basics are introduced focusing on the relationship between gas sensing and particle 
morphology (e.g. agglomerated vs. aggregated) and heterogeneity (e.g. noble metal surface clusters) including 
the embedding of noble metals into the chemoresistive metal oxides, a unique feature of flame-made particles. 
Then,  sensors  are  distinguished  between  those  made  by  conventional  wet-deposition  of  flame-made  sensing 
particles and those made by direct flame deposition onto sensing substrates. The fundamentals of combustion 
synthesis of sensing particles are traced to those of ceramic particles with emphasis on direct flame deposition of 
sensing films as their assembly can be monitored in situ, another unique feature of combustion processes. This is 
followed by a presentation of the evolution of flame-made gas sensor compositions (e.g. based on SnO2, WO3, 
ZnO,  TiO2  and  other  materials)  with  respect  to  selective  sensing  of  key  analytes  (ethanol,  NO2,  CO,  acetone, 
isoprene, H2  etc.). Finally, sensor systems (arrays and catalytic or gas chromatographic filters) and their inte-
gration into devices with validation under realistic conditions are presented. Examples like carcinogenic form-
aldehyde  monitoring  in  indoor  air,  fat  metabolism  monitoring  in  human  breath  or  the  distinction  of  toxic 
methanol from ethanol in alcoholic beverages and hand sanitizers are elaborated to demonstrate the immediate 
practical impact of flame-made gas sensors.   

1. Introduction 

Today sensors are indispensable for the detection of specific gasses 
(or analytes) to prevent gas poisoning, explosions and drunk driving as 
well as for the standard testing of automotive exhaust (Table 1). Gas 
sensors are used more and more for monitoring air quality and illnesses 
(asthma, carbohydrate intolerances, bacterial overgrowth in the small 
intestine)  or  physiological  conditions  (e.g.  body  fat  metabolism).  In 
2020, gas sensors had a $2.3 billion market size [1]. In comparison, the 
market  for  carbon black  (the  biggest flame-made  material  by  volume 
and value [2]) was $17.2 billion [3] in 2018, while it was $3.4 and $2.1 
billion for nano-TiO2 [4] and nano-ZnO [5] in 2015, respectively. Even 
though  the market of gas  sensors might  appear small, their impact is 
much, much larger. For example, the cost of false fire alarms is £1 billion

just in the UK [6]. Also the costs associated with asthma (i.e. $56 billion 
in 2011) are steadily increasing with a desperate need for preventive 
care and early treatment [7]. 

Despite the increasing use of gas sensors, there are concerns about 
their accuracy originating from interfering chemicals and the irrepro-
ducibility of their measurements [8] that limit their market penetration 
to  many  promising  applications.  As  a  result,  most  modern  electronic 
devices  (e.g. smartphones) offer voice and  touch recognition, activity 
tracking, video recording and orientation to name a few of their features 
by physical sensors [9] but not any molecular (chemical) recognition. 

A gas sensor detects analytes by their interaction with the sensing 
material.  Depending  on  their  concentration,  an  electrical  or  optical 
signal  of  proportional  magnitude  is  generated  and  displayed  accord-
ingly. This is accomplished by a variety of sensor types depending on the

stringent power requirements of battery-driven electronics pose further 
challenges. 

Most solid-state sensing materials are ceramics, but also polymers (e. 
g. polyaniline [10]) or noble metals (e.g. Pd [11]) have been applied, 
that detect a chemical reaction between the gas and adsorbed species on 
the surface of these materials inducing a change of their electric resis-
tance. This interaction is similar to heterogeneous catalysis where the 
focus, however, is on the product of that reaction while in sensors the 
focus is on electronic charge transport. Chemoresistivity was recognized 
probably  first  in  semiconducting  ceramics  by  Heiland  et  al.  [12]  and 
Bielanski et al. [13] in 1957 and exploited for sensing of CO and volatile 
organics by Seiyama et al. [14] in 1962. Even though about 60 years 
have gone by since then and numerous of such sensors have been re-
ported based on metal oxides (MOx) like SnO2, WO3, TiO2, ZnO etc., 
only  a  few  met  commercial  success  (Table  1).  Most  of  these  sensors 
failed  on  the  3S  and  never  left  their  laboratories.  Advances  in  nano-
technology offer sophisticated materials with large specific surface area 
of  exquisite  composition  and  selective  interaction  with  analytes  to 
convert  their  chemical  information  into  useful  signals.  Consequently, 
there is a pressing need to engineer and assemble sensing systems at the 
nanoscale and produce them en masse. 

Combustion  processes  are  uniquely  suited  to  fulfill  this  need  with 
their proven  record for the  manufacture of  nanostructured  MOx with 
large surface area even at t/h [15] that has been exploited for years in 
the manufacture of commodities (carbon blacks, white pigments, fumed 
oxides, optical fibers etc.). Of special interest in assembling gas sensors, 
is  the  capacity  of  these  processes  to  form  particles  with  closely

controlled size, composition and morphology. Combustion processes are 
used also to directly deposit sensing films onto electronic circuitry [16] 
that  can  be  monitored  in  situ  through  the  electric  resistance  of  the 
growing  film  [17],  a  distinct  advantage  over  conventional 
wet-chemistry  processes.  Such  direct  flame  aerosol  deposition  (FAD) 
requires fewer process steps than conventional mixing of particles with 
solvents and depositing films by spin coating (SC), screen printing (SP) 
or  doctor  blading  (DB)  followed  by  crack-prone  film  drying  [18].  In 
particular,  the  stable  capturing  of  metastable  phases  and  assembly of 
filamentary sinter-necked film structures of high strength and porosity 
by combustion [19] are most attractive in the preparation of gas sensors. 
As  a  result,  flame-made  sensing  devices  are  making  unprecedented 
contributions to the highly selective sensing of gasses and vapors (down 
to  ppb)  in  complex  mixtures  (breath  and  indoor  air  in  chapter  5)  at 
challenging  conditions  (high  relative  humidity  (RH)  and  even  room 
temperature) [20], as eludicated with specific examples in the following 
chapters. 

The assembly of gas sensors is a relatively new application of flame- 
made  materials.  The  capacity  of  combustion  aerosol  technology  for 
synthesis of sophisticated materials including chemoresistive gas sensors 
was  highlighted  [19] with  SnO2  sensors  made by  either  drop coating 
(DC) and annealing of flame-made nanoparticles onto sensor substrates 
(flame-made  and  wet  deposition, FWD)  [21] or  by  direct  combustion 
chemical vapor (CCVD) [16] or aerosol deposition on these substrates 
(flame  aerosol  deposition,  FAD)  [22].  Tricoli  et  al.  [23]  compared 
various routes for the preparation of gas sensors including combustion 
synthesis of pure and doped SnO2, TiO2 and WO3 sensors. The potential 
of combustion aerosol technology for the assembly of devices, including 
chemoresistive  gas  sensors,  through  systematic  chemical  engineering 
was brought forward in 2010 [24]. Samerjai et al. [25] and Kemmler 
et  al.  [26]  reviewed  how  flame  spray  pyrolysis  (FSP)  [27]  facilitated 
FAD and FWD of gas sensing films of diverse compositions, including 
single  and  double  material  layers  [28].  Li  et  al.  [29]  reviewed 
flame-made  materials  and  FAD  of  films  by  gas-  [30]  and  liquid-fed 
flames  for  various  applications,  including  MOx  gas  sensors.  Kelesidis 
et  al.  [31]  summarized  how  combustion  led  to  portable  gas  sensing 
devices by miniaturization [32] and assembly of FAD sensors into arrays 
[33]. The recent progress in flame-made gas sensors, among other ap-
plications, was summarized by Sheng et al. [34] and Pokhrel et al. [35] 
who  also  elucidated  particle  formation  pathways  by  single  droplet 
combustion in connection to FSP that has been reviewed very recently 
with over 500 articles [36]. Güntner et al. [20] emphasized the pivotal 
role of flame aerosol technology in predictive, preventive, personalized 
and  participatory  health  care,  especially  by  breath  analysis.  Van  den 
Broek et al. [37] brought forward the drastic selectivity enhancement of 

gas  sensors  by  preceding  them  with  sorption,  size-selective  and 
flame-made catalytic filters (packed-bed of particles) that enabled, for 
example, the assembly of a handheld device for methanol adulteration 
of liquors [38] and antiseptics [39]. 

Here,  progress  on  chemoresistive  flame-made  gas  sensors  is  pre-
sented.  First,  the  basics  of  gas  sensing  are  outlined.  Then  the  role  of 
combustion in the assembly of sensing films by FWD and FAD is sum-
marized  capitalizing  on  the  knowledge  base  of  flame  synthesis  of  ce-
ramics.  Subsequently, 
sensor 
compositions  are  elucidated  tracing  original  contributions  and 
compared with respect to their 3S for detecting a spectrum of analytes. 
Next,  gas  sensing  devices  (arrays  and  filter-sensor  systems)  and  their 
impact in emerging applications (breath analysis, food safety and indoor 
air quality) are presented. Finally, research frontiers and opportunities 
for flame-made sensors are highlighted.

2. Gas sensing 

Most  combustion-made  gas  sensors  are  chemoresistive-type  MOx. 
With  them, the  presence  and  concentration  of  analytes  are  converted 
into  electrical  signals  (i.e.  resistance  change)  reflecting  the  analyte 
interaction with the semiconductor surface [40]. This can be through 
ionosorbed surface oxygen or hydroxyl species (in the presence of hu-
midity) that trap electrons from the conduction band leading to electron 
depletion for n-type semiconductors (e.g. SnO2, ZnO, TiO2, WO3, In2O3) 
and hole accumulation for p-type (e.g. CuO, NiO, Co3O4, Cr2O3, Mn3O4) 
ones [41]. In n-type semiconductors, the Fermi level (i.e. exactly half of 
the electrons in the semiconductor possess at least this energy) lies closer 
to the energy level of the conduction band than that of the valence band 
so negative charges (electrons) are the majority carriers [42]. For p-type 
semiconductors  the  Fermi  level  lies  closer  to  the  energy  level  of  the 
valence  band  than  that  of  the  conduction  band  so  positive  charges 
(holes) are the majority carriers. When exposed to reducing analytes (e. 
g. CO) reacting with such ionosorbed species, electrons are injected into 
the surface-near layers (Fig. 1a,b). Hence, the film resistance of n-type 
semiconductors  is  reduced  while  that  for  p-type  ones  is  increased 
(Fig. 1c), and vice versa for oxidizing analytes (e.g. NO2). For example, 
the redox chemistry for sensing CO has been reviewed by Degler et al. 
[43] while that for n-butanol, H2S or NO2 by Ji et al. [44]. 

In  the  following,  electrical  conduction  in  chemoresistive  films  is 
discussed exemplarily for n-type semiconductors that constitute 90% of 
chemoresistive sensors [45] while p-type ones have been reviewed by 
Kim and Lee [45]. Typically, gas sensors consist of compact or porous 
chemoresistive  films  on  electrodes  residing  on  an  inert  substrate 
(Fig. 2). 

Fig. 1. Schematic illustration of n-type (a) and p-type (b) semiconducting nanoparticles with ionosorbed oxygen. Upon CO exposure, surface-trapped electrons are 
injected into the nanoparticles resulting in resistance decrease (n-type, red) and increase (p-type, blue) in the surface-near layers (c).

Compact films are obtained, for instance, by metal evaporation with 
subsequent oxidation [14] or atomic layer deposition [47]. There, an-
alyte interaction occurs solely on the film surface since analytes cannot 
penetrate it. As a result, only the resistance in the surface layer of the 
film  (RS)  is  changed  due  to  altered  charge  carrier  concentration  and 
energy  band  bending  (qVs:  q  is  the  elemental  charge,  Vs  the  surface 
potential and Ec,B the energy of the conduction band in the bulk) [46]. 
The bulk film resistance (RB) is unaffected and, as such, the bulk film 
does not participate in sensing. This surface (or space charge or deple-
tion) layer is thinner than one Debye length (λD, e.g. 4.4 nm for SnO2 at 
250

As a result, the overall resistance of chemoresistive films thicker than 
λD  is  analogous  to  two  parallel  resistors  (Fig.  2,  electrical  equivalent 
circuit). 

Porous films consist of particles similar to packed beds. Analytes can 
easily diffuse  through  such films and  interact with accessible  particle 
surfaces providing a large active area. For true packed beds of particles 
(point  contact  between  them,  i.e.  agglomerates)  with  a  (average) 
diameter larger than 2λD (Fig. 3a), the overall resistance depends on the 
individual particle bulk, surface-near layer and grain boundary (contact) 
resistances  [46].  Porous  films  made  with  such  agglomerates  are  less 
attractive due to their low mechanical stability (as demonstrated with 
electrophoretically-deposited films [49]) and high resistances (primarily 
due to contact resistance [50]).

More appealing are porous films of aggregated particles (i.e. necked 
with chemical inter-particle sinter or covalent bonds). These are obtained 
either by conventional annealing in an oven [51] or in situ by brief (15 - 
30  s)  and  intense  flame  heating  [52].  A  distinction  is  made  between 
sinter necks with diameters larger (Fig. 3b) or smaller (Fig. 3c) than 2λD 
[46]. In the first case, the neck features a core zone where the electrical 
properties  of  the  bulk  stay  intact,  and  a  depletion  layer  in  the 
surface-near  region  that  is  affected  by  analyte  interaction,  similar  to 
compact films (Fig. 2). As a result, the total resistance in the neck is 
analogous to two parallel resistors (i.e. bulk and depletion layer). For 
particles/necks smaller than 2λD, the depletion layer extends over the 
entire particle/neck. The resistance is governed by analyte-surface in-
teractions (like a “switch”), resulting in high analyte responses [46]. 

Such  particle  size  effects  are  shown  exemplarily  for  porous  SnO2 
films in Fig. 4a, where the responses to 800 ppm H2  (circles) and CO 
(triangles) in dry air more than tripled by reducing the crystal size from 
27 to 4 nm [51]. This size can be controlled by combustion processes (as 
elaborated in the next chapter) but most commonly in the gas sensor 
community during film annealing. 

The  temperature  of  the  sensor  determines  its  reactivity  with  the 
analyte  and  thus  its  chemoresistive  response.  In  fact,  the  maximum 
sensor response is usually obtained at temperatures where ~50% of the 
catalytic conversion of the analyte is achieved, as suggested with wet- 
made SnO2-based sensors of H2 and C3H6 [53]. This maximum depends 
strongly on sensing material composition and can differ for individual 
analytes,  as  shown  for  FAD  Ti-doped  ZnO  sensors  of  isoprene  and 
ammonia (Fig. 4b) along with acetone and ethanol at 90% RH [54]. 
Furthermore, higher temperatures accelerate also the kinetics of ana-
lyte adsorption and product desorption on the sensor surface (Fig. 1a, 
b). For instance, increasing the temperature of In2O3 from 200 to 300 
◦
C decreased the response time by more than two orders of magnitude 
to 1 ppm ozone at 40% RH [55]. As a result, the sensing temperature is 
a  key  variable  to  tune  sensitivity,  response  &  recovery  times  and 
selectivity. 

The  film  thickness  influences  also  the  sensor  response  of  porous 
films. For example, decreasing the thickness of FWD ZnO sensors [56] 
◦
from 15 to 5 μm increased their response to ethanol in dry air at 400 
C 
(Fig. 4c, triangles). On the other hand, an optimum film thickness of 3.1 
µm (circles) was obtained for the FAD WO3 sensor response to NO2 down 
◦
to 100 ppb at 50% RH and 125 
C [57]. In principle, large film thickness 
hinders effective mass transfer, as analyte transport is diffusion-limited, 
in  agreement  with  diffusion-reaction  theory  [58].  Decreasing  the 
thickness  of  a  sensing  film  facilitates  analyte  transport  through  its 
porous structure increasing its sensitivity. However, as the sensing film 
thickness decreases, the available film surface area for sensing also de-
creases resulting in such an optimum film thickness. Such film thickness 
optima  have  been  obtained  also  in  sensing  NO2  down  to  ppb  with 
sputtered WO3 films (at 150 

C) [59].

Most  chemoresistive  gas  sensors  consist  of  heterostructures  (e.g. 
noble  metal, NM, clusters on MOx  support) that optimize  sensor per-
formance by Fermi energy control and “spill-over” effects. In Fermi energy 
control (i.e. electronic sensitization) [60], the sensor resistance is modu-
lated  through  electronic  coupling  by  the  oxidation  state  of  the  NM 
clusters  (governed  by  surface  reactions)  on  the  surface  of  the  MOx 
support, the so-called strong metal-support interactions [61]. This effect is 
dominant with Pd that is usually present as oxide [62]. Worth noting, 
however,  is  that  during  flame  co-synthesis  of  Pd-containing  SnO2,  a

a  unique feature of flame-made heterostructures [64]. As  such it is in 
stark  contrast  to  those  made  by  standard  wet-chemistry  (i.e.  impreg-
nation,  precipitation  and  photodeposition)  processes  where  NM  are 
nearly always on the MOx surface. 

The “spill-over” effect (i.e. chemical sensitization) describes oxygen 
dissociation on the cluster surface enriching the MOx’s surface with 
oxygen ions promoting analyte oxidation (Fig. 5, inset top-left) and has 
been proposed for Pt on SnO2 [40]. For instance, adding small amounts 
of Pt (e.g. 0.2 wt%) doubled the sensitivity of FWD SnO2 to CO at 400 
◦
C  (Fig.  5,  squares  vs.  circles)  [65].  In  contrast,  more  Pt  (2  wt%) 
reduced it (triangles) below even that of pure SnO2 (circles). This was 
attributed to “localized” consumption of CO on the Pt surface without 
transfer  of  electrons  to  the  SnO2  conduction  band  (Fig.  5,  inset 
bottom-right). 

Frequently, also other metals (e.g. Si, Cr, Ti, Y, Al) are co-oxidized 
during  combustion  synthesis  of  chemoresistive  MOx.  Typically,  these 
additives enhance the thermal stability of the host oxides and alter their 
electronic properties (e.g. resistance) and surface chemistry (sorption, 
reactivity,  etc.)  strongly  affecting  sensing  performance.  Solid  solutions 
are formed if the additive (or dopant) is incorporated substitutionally (i. 
e. replacing host Ti cations with Al in TiO2  and promoting rutile for-
mation [66]) or interstitially (i.e. occupying interstitial lattice sites as 
with Si in TiO2 and promoting anatase formation [67]) capitalizing on 
the  relative  ionic  radii  sizes  of  dopant  and  host  [68].  Note  that  an 
elaborate introduction to substitutional and interstitial doping is given 
in textbooks [69]. For, the incorporation of Ti into SnO2  reduced the 
surface concentration of rooted and terminal hydroxyl species on SnO2 
that  minimized  the  interference  of  humidity  (0  –  60%  RH)  during 
ethanol sensing [70], as detailed in chapter 4.4.

lattice,  it  is  segregated  as  foreign  oxide  domain.  For  instance,  Si  is 
incorporated  into  SnO2  [72]  or  MoO3  [73]  but  at  increasing  concen-
trations forms also separate SiO2 domains. This decreases the crystal size 
and sinter neck diameter (Fig. 3c) of SnO2 and MoO3 but enhances their 
sensitivity to ethanol and ammonia, respectively, as it will be shown in 
chapter  4.  If  the  additive  oxide  is  not  semiconducting  (i.e.  SiO2),  a 
further  increase  of  its  content  increases  its  domain  size,  disrupts  the 
sensing network and converts the sensor into an insulator [72]. For such 
heterogeneous  materials,  a  direct  dependency  of  crystal  size  and 
response  (as  with  pure  SnO2,  Fig.  4a)  may  not  hold  anymore.  For 
instance, the highest acetic acid response for ZnO was obtained at 2.5 
mol% Y (triangles, Fig. 6), despite steadily decreasing the ZnO crystal 
size with increasing Y content (circles) [74], similar to Si-doping of SnO2 
[72] and MoO3 [73]. 

3. Flame-made gas sensors 

The  characteristics  of  sensing  films  and  their  operation  (Fig.  4) 
determine  the  performance  of  gas  sensors.  Fig.  7  summarizes  the  as-
sembly of flame-made gas sensors. Conventionally they are put together 
using flame-made MOx particles (with or without NM) collected on fil-
ters [21]. Then, such particles are suspended in fluids to form slurries or 
pastes  that  are  SP,  DB,  DC  or  SC  onto  sensor  substrates  followed  by 
drying and stabilization annealing to form the sensing films [51], termed 
here FWD. 

Alternatively,  such  films  are  assembled  by  FAD  onto  sensor  sub-
strates (Fig. 7) bypassing all wet-chemistry steps as  with flame-made 
catalysts.  These  films  are  grown  by  combustion  of  appropriate  pre-
cursors  and  deposition  of  either  molecular  clusters  (by  the  so-called 
CCVD)  [16]  or  particles  [22].  During  such  deposition,  the  electric 
resistance of the MOx film can be measured online to optimally deter-
mine  its  thickness  and  interconnectivity  [17].  Furthermore,  to  access 
other material classes like halides, such MOx films can be reduced and 
converted  in  dry  atmospheres  (e.g.  CuO  to  CuBr  with  H2  and  HBr,

surements as well [75]. Also, these films are annealed for stabilization 
prior to sensing. 

3.1. Flame synthesis of sensing particles 

These particles are pure, doped or mixed MOx with or without traces 
of  NM  (Fig.  7).  Thus,  their  synthesis  largely  follows  that  of  ceramic 
particles (Fig. 8). These are made by combustion of a precursor vapor 
largely  by  the  so-called  gas-to-particle  conversion  route:  reaction, 
nucleation (inception), surface growth, coagulation with full or partial 
coalescence  (aggregation  and  agglomeration)  as  flame  temperature 
drops [15]. 

As sensing materials are usually multi-component, their synthesis is 
dominated by combustion of appropriate liquid solutions. Upon spray-
ing these solutions, the resulting fluid ligaments break into droplets that 
rapidly evaporate to form sensing particles following the above route. 
Otherwise, multimodal, shell-like and hollow particles are formed [19] 
by droplet-to-powder conversion [76] that complicate subsequent film 
processing as they are hardly suitable for gas sensing. They are avoided 
by accelerating droplet evaporation through increased process temper-
ature  (i.e.  enclosing  or  external  heating  of  the  spray)  or  by  using 
appropriate solvents [77] and metal precursors (i.e. carboxylic [21]). 

Nucleation  is  not  well  understood  but  hardly  affects  the  size  and 
morphology  of  most  flame-made  materials  by  gas-to-particle  conver-
sion. Nevertheless, it’s important for multicomponent materials (e.g. Pd- 
containing SnO2) as it determines, for example, the partition of the NM 
between the surface and the bulk of the MOx support [63] as elaborated 
in chapter 4.1. Also, the addition of dopants to the precursor can affect 

crystallinity  during  nucleation  by  creation  of  interstitial  or  substitu-
tional defects (similar to annealing) and subsequent sensor selectivity, as 
discussed in the previous chapter. For example, Cr-doping of WO3 dur-
ing its FSP synthesis facilitated the stable capture of ε- WO3 for selective 
detection of acetone [79] as discussed in chapter 4.2. 

Coagulation and its interplay with coalescence (or sintering) domi-
nate  product  particle  characteristics,  and  thus  affect  sensor  perfor-
mance,  due  to  typically  employed  high  particle  concentrations.  This 
interplay had challenged engineers in combustion synthesis of materials 
for years that had forced a rather Edisonian design and operation of such 
units  [15].  Today,  however,  there  is  a  quantitative  understanding  of 
particle  coalescence  [80].  By  interfacing  it  with  coagulation  through 
2-dimensional  population  balances  [81]  and  taking  advantage  of  the 
nearly simultaneous attainment of asymptotic particle size distributions 
(self-preserving  [82])  and  structure  (fractal-like  [83])  as  shown  by 
mesoscale simulations [84], the characteristics of such particles can be 
described by simple aerosol number, area and mass balances [85]. 

By interfacing these balances with flame velocity and temperature 
from measurements or computational fluid dynamics (CFD), the product 
primary  particle  and  aggregate/agglomerate  particle  diameters 
(affecting  sensor  sensitivity,  Fig.  4a)  can  be  related  to  combustion 
process variables (precursor concentration, flame temperature and gas 
flowrates) for basic process design. This has been applied quite effec-
tively in flame synthesis of various ceramics and metals by vapor- and 
liquid-fed  flames  [24].  For  example,  vapor-fed  flame  experiments 
motivated by this understanding revealed the drastic impact of reactant 
mixing and to a lesser extent that of reactant concentration or compo-
sition  on  the  high-temperature  particle  residence  time  (HTPRT)  and 
product MOx particle size, crystallinity and morphology [15].

along  with  insets  of  the  FSP  schematic  as  well  as  particle  and  corresponding 
flame images. Adapted from [87]. 

Particles made by FSP following the gas-to-particle conversion route 
exhibit  identical  trends  with  the  above  vapor-fed  flames  [86].  For 
example,  Fig.  9  shows  that  the  FSP-made  CuO  crystal  size  (dXRD)  in-
creases (triangles) with precursor flow rate (P) at constant dispersion O2 
flow rate (D), while it decreases (squares) with increasing D at constant 
P, at otherwise constant conditions [87]. The impact of the decreasing D 
and increasing P on increasing dXRD is attributed to the increasing pre-
cursor concentration and HTPRT. In general, the precise impact of such 
process variables on product particle characteristics largely depends on 
the interplay of surface growth, coagulation and coalescence [88]. This 
can be inferred qualitatively by the corresponding images of increasing 
flame length (Fig. 9, insets) and quantitatively by CFD simulations of 
FSP [89]. 

With  the  above  coagulation-coalescence  understanding,  the  struc-
ture  of  fractal-like  particles  can  be  determined  from  the  ratio  of  the 
characteristic times for coagulation, τc, and sintering (or coalescence), 
τs. The τc, is the half-life of the aerosol by coagulation [90] and τs  the 
time needed to reduce the excess surface area of a filamentary particle 
by 63% over the area of its volume-equivalent sphere [81]. When τs  is 
much  smaller  than  τc,  compact  particles  are  formed  [91].  When  τs  is 
comparable to τc, aggregates of primary particles are formed that are held 
together by covalent forces. These particles are most attractive for gas 
sensing  as  they  minimize  the  grain  boundary  (contact)  resistance 
(Fig. 3b) in the sensing film. When τs  is much larger than τc, then ag-
glomerates of aggregates and/or primary particles are formed at point 
contact (Fig. 3a) that are held together by physical forces. The structure 
of  flame-made  particles  can  play  a  distinct  role  in  gas  sensing  as  for 
example,  FWD  sensors  made  from  size-selected  SnO2  aggregates 
exhibited over an order of magnitude higher sensor response to CO and 
ethanol than those made from their polydisperse agglomerates [92] as 
elaborated in chapter 4.1. 

Even though combustion synthesis of ceramic particles is reasonably 
well understood to scale it up to kg/h even at academic labs [93], the 
characteristics of the sensing film are what mostly matters in gas sensors. 
These  characteristics  can  be  quite  affected  by  the  standard  film 
annealing for stabilization, typically at 100 or 200 
C above the opera-
tional temperature of the sensor for a few hours. For example, Fig. 10

sion  flow  rates  (5  L/min)  along  with  the  responses  of  FWD  sensors  of  the 
annealed particles to 1 ppm of ethanol (squares) at 350

concentrations (PSC). Also shown are the sensor responses to ethanol 
(squares) when wet-depositing the annealed particles as films (to assure 
equal mass). 

As expected, the SnO2 crystal size increases with PSC (Fig. 10) and 
by annealing (circles vs. triangles) Despite this clear trend, the corre-
sponding  sensor  responses  of  the  annealed  sensing  film  to  ethanol 
(squares) are hardly affected by the crystal size of the respective parti-
cles (triangles) that almost doubles as the PSC increases from 0.1 M to 2 
M. Similar results were obtained for acetone [63]. At first, this might be 
surprising given Fig. 4a. These sizes, however, are fairly big and rather 
at the large tail of the sensor crystal size dependency of Fig. 4a and well 
above the Debye length of SnO2  (i.e. 3 nm, calculated with data from 
Ogawa et al. [48]) at the conditions of Fig. 10 for the crystal size to 
affect sensor response. Such data exemplify the significance of sensing 
film characteristics and the need to closely follow them as discussed in 
chapter 3.2.1. Note that such sensor measurements with as-prepared 
films  are  rarely  carried  out  as  these  are  unstable  (i.e.  they  exhibit 
strong baseline drift [94]). 

3.2. Flame aerosol deposition (FAD) of sensing films

FSP [17]. 

In contrast, particle-bed type films (Fig. 3) are stochastically created 
particle deposits within 3 – 5 min onto water-cooled sensor substrates 
mostly by FSP of precursor solutions (Fig. 12) as with most flame-made 
sensors that are typically multicomponent. Therefore, this type of sensor 
assembly will be discussed in detail. Nevertheless, pure MOx films have 
been deposited also by precursor vapor-fed flames onto static [30] and 
rotating sensor substrates [97] for the assembly of WO3  and TiO2  sen-
sors, as discussed in chapters 4.2 and 4.4, respectively. 

These  films  are  created  by  particle  transport  (i.e.  diffusion  and 
thermophoresis) to sensor substrates resulting in high porosities (e.g. up 
to  98%  for  SnO2,  as  determined  by  X-ray  signal  attenuation  [22],  or 
Al-doped  ZnO  assessed  by  gravimetric  analysis  and  SEM  [98])  and 
lace-like  morphology  from  interconnected  agglomerates  [22].  Such 
films are of high purity and crack-free, in contrast to wet-deposited ones 
where cracks usually form during solvent evaporation [18]. The open 
morphology  of  FAD  films  favors  gas  sensing  as  analytes  can  rapidly 
diffuse in and interact with the large surface area of the film that can 
result in high sensitivity and fast response / recovery times in compar-
ison to those made by FWD, as shown in chapter 4.4 with TiO2 sensors 
[97]. Therein, pore sizes effects should play only a negligible role on 
analyte transport. In fact, such pores between particle agglomerates in 
FAD films are typically >100 nm in diameter. This is significantly larger 
than analyte molecules (e.g. 0.46 nm for ethanol [99]). In fact  mem-
branes  acting  as  very  effective  filters  upstream  of  gas  sensors  greatly 
enhance sensor selectivity [100]. These filters capitalize on the differ-
ence between membrane pore and analyte sizes. 

3.2.1. Dynamics of film deposition 

The film thickness is determined by the FAD rate and duration [22]. 
That rate is determined largely by aerosol concentration and thermo-
phoresis  due  to  the  steep  temperature  gradient  between  flame  and 
sensor  substrate.  This  makes  deposition  by  Brownian  diffusion  less 
important, as determined from particle transport theory in the aerosol 
and heat transfer theory in the film. During FAD, the film growth rate by 
thermophoresis  decreases  with  increasing  thickness  of  the  depositing 
film (Fig. 13a) as its surface temperature increases due to insufficient 
heat  transfer  to  the  water-cooled  substrate  (Fig.  12).  Hence,  the  film 
thickness increases non-linearly with deposition time, as confirmed by 
models and measurements (Fig. 13b). These have been confirmed with

high temperature and short distances from the burner (3–9 cm) for long 
times (10 –  70 min) by inverted FAD, the so-called CCVD, (Fig. 11a)

peratures and precursor concentrations for short times (2 –  6 min) by

Multilayer  gas  sensing  films  can  be  assembled  by  consecutive 
deposition  of  different  materials  from  flames  [28].  Fig.  14  shows  a 
cross-sectional image of such a Pd-doped Al2O3  layer on top of a che-
moresistive  SnO2  one.  Each  layer  features  homogeneous  morphology 
and thickness. Despite similar deposition durations (i.e. 300 s) and FSP 
production rates, the Al2O3 top layer was significantly thinner. This was 
attributed  to  a  lower  thermophoretic  deposition  rate  with  increasing 
film  thickness  (Fig. 13a). Such  multilayer gas  sensing  films are  quite 
effective in increasing sensor selectivity as the top layer acts as a cata-
lytic filter to the underlying sensing layer, as discussed in chapter 5.2.2. 

3.2.2. Film stability and in situ annealing 

A drawback of FAD films is their weak mechanical stability due to 
poor  cohesion  and  adhesion  (van  der  Waals)  forces  between  the 
deposited  particles  and  with  the  substrate,  especially  when  using 
shadow  masks  during  FAD  [52].  Stabilization  of  such  lace-like  films 
(Fig. 15a) can be achieved by rapid (30 s) in situ flame annealing. This 
led,  for  example,  to  cauliflower-like  films  that  reduced  also  their 
porosity  from  98%  to  62%  (Fig.  15b).  Note  that  cross-sectional  SEM 
analysis  on  in  situ  flame  annealed  WO3  films  indicated  rather

fabrication (Fig. 15c) [103]. Each of these low-power gas sensors had an 
active sensing film of a few hundred µm diameter (Fig. 15d) and about 
20 µm thickness. 

3.2.3.

In situ monitoring of film deposition 

The  degree  of  coalescence  between  constituent  film  particles  de-
termines  their  extent  of  aggregation,  necking  and  subsequently  the 
film’s  contact  resistance  and  thus  sensor  performance  (Fig.  3). 
Measuring the resistance in situ during deposition of such films provides 
immediate feedback on the status of their conductive network, as shown 
during  the preparation of CuO nanowires [104] and tetrafurcated 3D 
bridges [105] for CO sensors by thermal-oxidative growth and charged 
aerosol deposition, respectively. Such in situ resistance monitoring has 
been  used  to  monitor  the  assembly  of  FAD  sensing  films  (e.g. 
Sb-containing SnO2 [17], Fig. 16a). 

With increasing deposition time of such films, their resistance drops 
drastically to an asymptotic value (Fig. 16b) that depends largely on 
their morphology rather than on thickness or constituent nanoparticle 
size. More specifically, various PSC enable the FAD of sensing films with 
different morphologies, each exhibiting a characteristic in situ resistance 
pattern during their assembly. Low PSC (1 mM) lead to thin (ca. 0.16 
μm) films with columnar structure (Fig. 16c,d). During their deposition, 
these  films  showed  a  distinctly  oscillating  and  quite  high  resistance 
(Fig.  16b,  squares)  reflecting  fewer  conducting  pathways  than  films 

made at higher PSC. This oscillation mirrored the creation of conducting 
networks (resistance reduction) by deposition and subsequent break-up 
(resistance  increase)  by  sintering  [106]  corresponding  somehow  to  a 
continuous transition from lace- to cauliflower-like film structures [52]. 
Such oscillations are also present at higher PSC (10 mM, Fig. 16b, cir-
cles)  with  lower  intensity  as  more  compact  and  slightly  thicker  films 
with apparently much more conducting pathways are created [17]. Even 
higher precursor concentrations (100 mM) lead to much thicker (up to 
80  μm),  fluffier,  fractal-like  and  porous  films  but  with  higher  in  situ 
resistance (Fig. 16b, triangles) and worst sensor performance as might 
be expected from Fig. 4c. This in  situ resistance monitoring  revealed 
optimal synthesis of thin (100 nm) films within a minute using low PSC 
(10  mM)  that  exhibit  the  best  sensing  performance  and  on  par  with 
thicker (e.g. 1.5 μm) films made with higher PSC (500 mM) by FAD and 
in situ annealing [52]. 

3.2.4.

In situ conversion of MOx to MZ films 

An  inherent  limitation  of  flame-made  gas  sensors  is  their  confine-
ment to MOx due to the oxidizing flame environment. However, such 
MOx films can be converted to metal bromides, sulfides, nitrides and 
carbides by closely controlling reaction temperature and gas atmosphere 
by capitalizing on the in-situ monitoring of film resistance. For example, 
FAD of CuO films (Fig. 17a) followed by in situ reduction to metallic Cu 
and subsequent dry bromination by HBr (Fig. 7) led to highly porous 
(78%)  CuBr  films  [75]  by  monitoring  in  situ  the  film  resistance 
(Fig. 17b) and exploiting the distinctly different bulk resistivities [107] 
(cid:0) 6 and 105 Ω⋅m 
of CuO, Cu and CuBr [108], being approximately 104, 10
at 20 

C, respectively [75].

(h) dry bromination to CuBr with magnified insets. Reprinted from [75]. 

The  as-prepared  film  by  FAD  features  a  lace-like  morphology  of 
interconnected CuO particles (dXRD = 11 nm, squares in Fig. 17c) with a 
94% porosity (Fig. 17d). Upon complete reduction with H2  to Cu, the 
high porosity is maintained while Cu crystals grow to 29 nm (circles in 
Fig. 17e) with enhanced inter-particle necking (Fig. 17f). Most impor-
tantly, the porous (78%) and nanostructured (dXRD = 56 nm, diamonds 
in Fig. 17g) morphology is preserved even during dry-bromination to 
CuBr (Fig. 17h) which was carried out by exposing the Cu film to HBr 
gas  from  calibrated  gas  cylinders  [75].  The  off-gas  was  scrubbed  by 
bubbling it through water. In contrast, CuBr films made by conventional 
wet-chemistry conversion [109] were less porous (43%), coarser (dXRD 
= 134 nm) featuring inferior ammonia sensitivity and response times 

[75], as discussed in chapter 4.5. As a result, this post-treatment of FAD 
films is attractive for industry, as each process step is performed on the 
chip level that minimizes the operational unit number. 

4. Materials for flame-made gas sensors 

Although gas sensors are prepared typically by wet chemistry, many 
chemoresistive ones have been made already by combustion capitalizing 
on  its  unique  advantages  for  synthesis  of  materials  (chapter  3)  and, 
most notably, on their unique structure (filamentary) and composition 
(metastable  and  oxide  solid  solutions).  Table  2  shows  the  detailed 
composition,  fabrication  method,  testing  conditions  and  selected

analytical figures of merit of flame-made gas sensors. Almost all of them 
were made by spray combustion (i.e. FSP and FASP) of precursor solu-
tions  resulting  in  MOx  particles  that  are  either  FAD  onto  sensor  sub-
strates  or  collected  by  filtration  and  deposited  as  pastes  (DB,  DC)  or 
slurries  (SC)  with  subsequent  drying  (FWD)  and  annealing  (Fig.  7). 
Quite frequently dopants are used to enhance the sensing performance 
as with other flame-made materials (catalysts, pigments etc.). Here, the 
performance  of  flame-made  sensors  is  discussed  with  respect  to  the 
following key parameters: The sensor response (Sk) to an analyte k is 
Sk=Rair/Rk-1 (or sometimes Sk=Rair/Ri) and Sk=Rk/Rair-1 for n- and p- 
type semiconductors, respectively, with Rk and Rair being the resistance 
under  analyte  exposure  and  in  air,  respectively  [110].  The  sensor 
response is significant as long as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is larger 
than 1 to be distinguished from the measurement noise. Furthermore, 
response is not to be confused with sensitivity that is the slope of the 
sensor  response  over  analyte  concentration,  according  to  DIN 
1319–1:1995–01 5.4. The analyte selectivity is the ratio of analyte over 
confounder or interferant response. The stability (in days) is the dura-
tion  of  sensor  evaluation  without  obvious  deterioration  of  its  perfor-
mance. The response and recovery times are defined as the times needed 
to reach or recover 90% of the analyte response. And finally, LDL is the 
smallest concentration that can be measured with a reasonable certainty 
(typically SNR = 3), according to IUPAC. 

4.1. SnO2 

This is the most prominent gas sensor material for its excellent and 
tunable  sensitivity  to  various  analytes  [171].  As  a  result,  SnO2-based 
sensors are commercially established (Table 1, e.g. Figaro TGS2611 and 
Sensirion SGP30). However, they are less successful if specific VOCs (i.e. 
acetone,  formaldehyde,  benzene  etc.)  are  to  be  monitored  with  high 
selectivity  (e.g.  in  human  breath,  chapter  5.3.1)  unless  included  in 
arrays (chapter 5.1) or combined with filters (chapter 5.2). 

Probably the first combustion-made SnO2 gas sensors were prepared 
by FSP of a tin 2- ethylhexanoate (Sn-EHA) in ethanol solution [21]. The 
resulting monocrystalline cassiterite powders of about 17 nm in primary 
particle diameter were DC onto Al2O3 substrates with interdigitated Pt 
◦
electrodes and annealed for 10 min in 500 
C. When these sensors were 
exposed to oxidizing NO2, their resistance increased (Fig. 18) while it 
decreased when exposed to reducing CO and propanal, characteristic for 
n-type sensors (Fig. 1c). They exhibited higher response in dry air than 
in  50%  RH  and  fast  response  and  recovery  times,  on  par  with 
state-of-the-art sensors at the time. 

′

Liu et al. [16] assembled SnO2 films by FAD of the above precursor 
◦
C. Such 
solution for 20 min onto Pt electrodes on a thin Ti layer at 850 
films  had  columnar  morphology  with  cauliflower-like  surface  texture 
made of aggregated particles smaller than 30 nm each. These sensors 
had exceptional (280 – 1
070) response to 100 – 500 ppm ethanol and 
short  response  and  recovery  times  (8  –  55  s),  outperforming  sensors 
made  by  other  techniques  (i.e.  Table  1  in  ref.  [16]),  including  metal 
oxide  evaporation,  monodisperse  particle  deposition  and  oxidation 
[172]. 

By FAD of a Sn-EHA in toluene solution for three minutes, M¨adler 
et  al.  [22]  assembled  highly  porous  (98%)  and  lace-like  pure  and 
Pt-doped SnO2 films onto sensor substrates to sense 5 – 50 ppm CO and 
C with 0 –  50% RH. By subsequent 30 s in situ flame

C in response to various 

these  films  became  denser 

(62%  porosity)  and 
annealing, 
cauliflower-like with high cohesion and adhesion to the substrate [52]. 
This  drastically  improved  their  mechanical  stability  for  subsequent 
dicing and processing [103]. 

Nearly monodisperse FSP-made SnO2  largely aggregates of 68, 118 
or 238 nm aerodynamic diameter consisting of primary particles of 10 
nm in grain and crystal size were DB to make sensors that exhibited up to 
600 times higher response to 5 – 100 pm of ethanol and 4 – 50 ppm of CO 
than their polydisperse agglomerates and commercial SnO2  [92]. This 
was attributed to more uniform sinter neck sizes in small, size-selected 
agglomerates  of  aggregates  than  in  large,  polydisperse  ones  as 
observed by microscopy. In fact, the performance of these sensors was 
strongly related to the microstructural morphology of the sensing film 
(Fig.  3)  highlighting  the  potential  of  particle  morphology  on  sensor 
performance. 

Zhan et al. [96] assembled SnO2 films by CH4-air FAD of the above 
solution  for  10  –  70  min  onto  sensor  substrates.  By  decreasing  the 
burner-substrate  distance  from  9  to  3  cm,  the  film  morphology  was 
altered  from  granular  to  columnar  due  to  the  deposition  of  small  ag-
glomerates on the sensor substrate. This increased the sensor response to 
ethanol  and  H2  in  dry  air  due  to  fewer  grain  boundaries  enhancing 
charge transfer. 

Frequently,  other  elements  are  added  to  SnO2  to  tune  its  thermal 
stability  (Table  2)  for  enhancing  its  selectivity  [53],  sensitivity  and 
robustness to humidity [70]. These improvements are associated with 
chemical state (as observed for Ti [70], Pd and Pt [62]), thermal stabi-
lization  (e.g.  Si  [72])  and  dispersion  (e.g.  for  Pd  [173])  on  the  SnO2 
surface  as  well  as into  the  bulk of SnO2  with Pt  [65] and  Pd  [63] as 
shown below. For instance, the crystal size of FWD Pt-doped SnO2 [65] 
was hardly affected by the content of Pt that was present as oxide, as 
shown by extended X-ray absorption fine structure and surface-sensitive 
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy with some oxidized Pt incorporation 
into  bulk  SnO2  even  though  it  had  a  distinct  impact  on  sensing  CO 
(Fig. 5) as discussed in chapter 2. 

Similarly, adding 0.2 wt% Pd to SnO2  (squares, Fig. 19) increased 

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience90(2022)10099215A.T. Güntner et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             

the  response  to  H2  by  three  orders  of  magnitude  (e.g.  at  1  vol%  H2) 
compared to pure SnO2  (diamonds) [119]. This was much higher than 
with the same amount of Pt (circles) or Ru (triangles). The high affinity 
of Pd to H2 is often attributed [60] to the catalytic activity of metallic Pd 
clusters and associated Fermi-level control (chapter 2). However, X-ray 
absorption  spectroscopy  revealed  only  oxidized  Pd2+
for 
◦
wet-made SnO2 impregnated with 0.2 mol% Pd and annealed at (450 
C 
for 1 h) [62], as well as flame-made SnO2 with 0.2 and 1 wt% Pd [125]. 
As  the  ionic  radius  of  Pd4+
(0.69  Å)  [174], 
substitutional incorporation of Pd into SnO2 is likely. Upon reduction in 
0.5%  H2/He  at  300 
C,  still  25  mol%  of  the  Pd  stayed  oxidized  sug-
gesting some Pd incorporation into the SnO2  during FSP. An incorpo-
ration  (or  embedding)  of  Pd  had  been  observed  also  with  other 
metal-oxides  when  leaching  FSP-made  particles  in  aqua  regia  and/or 
HF  [64].  In  fact,  84,  65  and  32%  Pd  (of  the  nominal  9  mol%)  were 
identified  inside  the  bulk  of  FSP-made  TiO2,  Al2O3  and  SiO2, 
respectively.

Pineau et al. [63] explored the impact of Pd embedded in SnO2  on 
sensor performance by FSP synthesis of SnO2  containing 0 – 3 wt% Pd 
followed by air annealing and reduction in H2/Ar. Leaching these par-
ticles in aqueous HNO3 resulted in SnO2 particles free from Pd on their 
surface  but  embedded  with  50  to  75%  of  the  nominal  Pd  content 
(Fig. 20a). For example, sensors made by DB such particles at 1 and 3 
mol%  nominal  Pd  content  showed  7  –  90  times,  respectively,  higher 
response (Fig. 20b, circles) to 1 ppm CO than those made with SnO2 
particles  containing  also  Pd  on  their  surface  (Fig.  20b,  triangles). 
Similar  results  were obtained  with acetone and  ethanol  revealing the 
sensor  performance  improvement  by  such  embedded  Pd,  a  distinct 
feature of flame-made sensing materials in comparison to those made by 
conventional  wet-chemistry.  This  drastic  improvement  in  sensing  is 
probably due to transducing effects from the presence of Pd ions in the 
SnO2 lattice [125] and/or PdOx clusters/domains in bulk SnO2 as with

Wet-impregnated Pt/Pd clusters (each NM 0.5 wt%, total 1%) onto 
FSP-made SnO2 and subsequent annealing [133] inverted SnO2 from n- 
◦
to p-type semiconductor (Fig. 1) at 150 – 300 
C in dry air (Fig. 21). This 
inversion was related to a change of major charge carriers from electrons 
to holes due to the formation of a deep and extended electron depletion 
layer (Fig. 3) in SnO2  near the Pd clusters. Such strong metal-support 
interactions  are  observed  also  for  other  flame-made  heterostructures 
[176]. The highest CO response, however, was obtained for 1 wt% Pd at 
60 
C (i.e. 19 to 6.7 ppm) that was, at least, two orders of magnitude 
higher than pure SnO2 and with 1 wt% Pt or the above-mentioned Pt/Pd 
(Fig. 21) that was related to spill-over effects while Fermi energy control 
might effect it as well (chapter 2) [133]. 

◦

The addition of Si (1 –  3 wt%) during FSP mitigated sintering and 
preserved small SnO2 crystals with particle neck size comparable to their 

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience90(2022)10099216A.T. Güntner et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             

that subsequently reduced the film resistance, following the discussion 
of transduction in porous films (Fig. 3). Such gas sensors exhibited up to 
six times higher sensitivity down to 20 ppb ethanol than pure SnO2. 

Doping  with  an  electron  donor  can  lower  the  resistance  of  SnO2 
sensors [42]. The baseline resistance of FAD SnO2 films doped with 1 wt 
% Sb was reduced by Fermi level control up to three orders of magnitude 
′
and the sensor signal to 500 – 2
000 ppm CH4 improved by about 50% 
over pure SnO2  at 300 
C in humid and dry air while the crystal and 
grain size of the SnO2  were hardly affected [115]. Simultaneous work 
function change and conductivity measurements indicated a transition 
from a depletion layer controlled conduction (chapter 2) to a degen-
erated semiconductor surface mechanism since the addition of Sb moves 
the Fermi level very close to the conduction band edge [118].

4.2. WO3 

Tungsten oxide has several stable phases at different temperatures 
with distinct surface chemistry making it ideal for gas sensing [177]. For 
instance, pyrolyzed and DC sensors of WO3  had been used for sensing 
NO2  due  to  their  high  sensitivity  and  selectivity  already  at  moderate 
temperatures (e.g. 200 
C) [178] as well as acetone, benzene, NH3 etc. 
[179].  The  WO3  is  also  quite  robust  in  the  presence  of  water  vapor 
making  it  attractive  for  sensing  in  humid  atmospheres  (i.e.  breath 
analysis). 

◦

Perhaps  the  first  flame-made  WO3  gas  sensor  was  prepared  by 
oxidation of WF6 in a low-pressure premixed oxy-hydrogen flame [30]. 
When deposited by molecular beam assisted particle deposition as 50 
nm thin films on interdigitated Au electrodes onto p-type silicon wafers 
′
with insulating SiO2 layer, such sensors responded to 1
000 ppm of CO 
and NO at 310 

C. 

◦

◦

Tungsten oxide films doped with Cr were made by FWD onto sensor 
substrates and exhibited high acetone selectivity over various analytes 
in dry air at 400 
C (Fig. 23a) [79].  This performance was traced to 
stable capturing of the metastable ε-WO3 phase by the Cr doping during 
its  flame  synthesis  and  rapid  cooling.  Conventionally,  the  thermody-
namically  stable  monoclinic  γ-phase  is  obtained  that  transforms  to  β- 
and subsequently α-WO3  at high temperature [180]. The unique selec-
tivity of these sensors to acetone was attributed to the interaction of its 
higher dipole moment over that of other analytes with the spontaneous 
dipole  moment  of  ε-WO3  [79],  while  crystal  defects,  exposed  crystal 
facets [181] and surface acidity [74] can also play a role. 

◦

Replacing  Cr  by  Si  and  direct  FAD  followed  by  in  situ  annealing 
preserved the selective sensing of acetone [138] and enabled its detec-
tion  down  to  20  ppb  at  90%  RH  (Fig.  23b).  Both  dopants  stabilized 
similarly the metastable ε-phase (ca. 80 wt%) of WO3  during FSP and 
annealing  at  500 
C.  However,  FAD  Si-doped  WO3  sensors  [138] 
◦
C in 
exhibited more than double the response to 500 ppb acetone at 400 
dry air than FWD Cr-doped WO3  films [79]. This might be related to 
doping, but also the different deposition technique should play a role, as 
discussed later for TiO2 (Fig. 28c). Such excellent acetone sensing per-
formance  facilitated  the  use  of  these  sensors  in  breath  analysis  by 
making them portable for online [32] and offline [182] breath acetone 
detection  with  humans.  The  availability  of  such  sensors  enabled  the 
monitoring of body fat burning during exercise [183] and dieting [184], 
as  discussed  in  Section  5.3.1.  Furthermore,  their  unique  selectivity 
made them indispensable in orthogonal sensor arrays [185] for search 
and rescue applications [186] (Section 5.1).

Debye length (Fig. 22) [72]. This morphology drastically enhanced (up 
to six times) the sensitivity to ethanol (down to 100 ppb at 1.4 wt% SiO2 
content) by maintaining a thermally stable high surface area and fully 
depleting the SnO2 inter-particle necks (Fig. 3c). This enhancement was 
attributed  mostly  to  the  decreasing  neck  size  between  SnO2  nano-
particles (Fig. 22, inset). At high SiO2  contents (4 wt%), sintering was 
inhibited but sensing was deteriorated as the dielectric SiO2 isolated the 
SnO2 grains and disrupted their semiconducting network. 

Also  asymmetric  electrode  assemblies  can  reduce  the  baseline 
resistance  of  FAD  sensing  films  [175].  Nanoparticles  serving  as  elec-
trodes (e.g. CuO) were stochastically deposited either below or above a 
SnO2  film. They provided conduction pathways with lower resistivity,

4.3. ZnO 

Pure  ZnO  is  inherently  unstable  and  rapidly  grows  even  at  room 
temperature in humid atmospheres, especially for dXRD smaller than 20 
nm  [187].  As  a  result,  pure  ZnO  is  rarely  used  for  gas  sensing  but 
frequently doped (Table 2). Perhaps the first flame-made ZnO sensor 
was prepared by FAD of zinc nitrate in ethanol solutions onto Si wafer 
◦
substrates [95] for 30 min at 1100 
C (Fig. 11a). The resulting flakes 
(Fig. 11b) were scrapped off and broken to finer particles and suspended 
in ethanol before DC and drying them onto Pt electrodes (Fig. 25, inset). 
The response of the resulting sensors to 300 – 500 pm ethanol in dry air 
C (Fig. 25) was 8 –  14 with 8 –  122 s response and recovery 
at 400 
times,  respectively.  Such  a  performance  is  outdated  today  with  room 
temperature sensors of ethanol down to 100 ppb (i.e. [153]). 

◦

Such sensors were prepared also by FWD of pure ZnO with mostly 
spheroidal and some hexagonal and rod-like particles onto sensor sub-

The addition of 1 wt% Pt to WO3 during its FWD resulted in sensors

C [140], out-
with a high response (~2
performing all SnO2  ones in Fig. 19. This was attributed to small (< 1 
nm) Pt clusters that dissociate H2 and spill over the WO3 surface (Fig. 5, 
top-left). These sensors exhibited also distinct (≥ 20) H2 selectivity over 
CO, acetylene and ethanol that was superior (Table 2) to similarly made 
ZnO- [146] and In2O3-based ones [167].

Pure γ-WO3 sensors made by FAD showed a response of ~1.2 to 300

C and 50% RH 
[26]. Similarly, FAD but in situ annealed films of mixed γ- and ε-WO3

exhibited higher response (110) to 100 ppb NO2 at 125 
C and 50% RH 
(Fig. 4c, circles) that were more than two orders of magnitude higher

than reactive-ion magnetron sputtered films [59] at comparable 150 
C 
and 45% RH. Most importantly, at optimal film thicknesses of 2 – 3 µm, 
detection of NO2  down to 3 ppb was achieved [57], fulfilling E.U. (20 
ppb)  and  U.S.  (53  ppb)  annual  mean  exposure  limits.  These  sensors 
exhibited also outstanding NO2 selectivity (>800) over CO, H2S, H2 and 
CH4 which are of critical importance to air quality monitoring.

Microscopic analysis revealed rGO sheets covered with finer WO3  par-
ticles than those made in the absence of rGO. Films of WO3 with 3 wt% 
rGO featured the highest sensor response (Fig. 24) as rGO led to lowered 
sensing temperatures than pure WO3, a key feature for their application 
in portable devices with stringent power requirements.

Doping  FSP-made  ZnO  with  1  mol%  Au  and  blending  it  with  a 
polymer that was drop-casted onto interdigitated electrodes resulted in 
′
room temperature sensors of 25 –  1
000 ppm NH3  in dry air with re-
sponses  up  to  30  and  less  than  a  min  response  time  [151]. 
Titanium-doped  ZnO  sensors  made  by  FAD  with  in  situ  annealing 
featured 15 and 45 times higher isoprene response (i.e. 4.4 to 500 ppb at 
90% RH and 325 
C) than pure ZnO and TiO2, respectively [54]. This 
resulted in high selectivity over acetone (5), ethanol (9) and ammonia 
(11) and even the lowest 5 ppb of isoprene was detected with SNR > 10. 
All these were attributed to Ti4+
point defects at the ZnO surface that 
intensify  the  interaction  with  isoprene,  as  revealed  by  in  situ  diffuse 
reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS). 

◦

Similarly,  FAD  and  in  situ  annealed  Y-containing  ZnO  sensors 
exhibited more than 600 times higher response than sol-gel made and 
electrospun ones [188] to acetic acid, a coffee and cocoa aroma tracer 
[74].  At  an  optimal  Y-content  of  2.5  mol%  (Fig.  6),  acetic  acid  con-
centrations down to 10 ppb were detected within two min under 90% 
RH.  Most  remarkably,  such  sensors  featured  up  to  three  orders  of 
magnitude higher acetic acid selectivity over ethanol and acetone than 
similarly  made  pure  ZnO,  SnO2  and  WO3  (Fig.  26)  due  to  the  high 
surface basicity of Y-containing ZnO. 

Thin NiO layers were sputtered on highly porous (98%) FAD and in 
situ annealed ZnO films [153] and resulted in sensor responses of 0.77 – 
2.6 to 0.1 – 1 ppm ethanol under solar irradiation at room temperature 
(Fig.  27).  Since  NiO  and  ZnO  are  p-  and  n-type  semiconductors, 
respectively, a p-n junction forms at their interface. Solar irradiation on 
these nanoparticles generates electron-hole pairs (i.e. photoelectric ef-
fect) that are separated by that p-n junction [42]. Such generated elec-
trons can be trapped by ionosorbed species on the nanoparticles’ surface 
and  contribute  to  gas  sensing,  as  illustrated  in  Fig.  1.  Responses  and 
baseline  drifted  with  time while recovery  times were rather slow  but 
typical for room temperature sensing. 

Transparent conductive films of Al-doped (1 mol%) ZnO films were 
made by FWD that featured more than six times higher response to 10

the same composition that were deposited identically [154]. Al-doped 
ZnO  films  with  increasing  porosity  from  10  to  98%  have  been  made 
also  by  FAD  by  increasing  the  substrate  height  [96]  above  the  FSP 
burner [98]. This increased the sensor conductivity by more than four

orders of magnitude, that was attributed to reduced porosity. However, 
incorporated Al3+
ions serve as electron donor [42] in ZnO leading to 
increased free carrier concentration [190] that enhances conductivity as 
well. At high porosity (98%), such films nicely responded to ethanol and 
NO2 at room temperature in dry air but had slow response times with a 
baseline drift (e.g. no equilibrium response within 20 min for ethanol). 

4.4. TiO2 

Titania  sensors  are  quite  robust  with  respect  to  humidity  due  to 
desorption of water-related species from their surface already at mod-
erate temperatures [191]. As a result, they are attractive for gas sensing 
in humid atmospheres as in human breath (chapter 5.3.1). However 
these sensors feature relatively low analyte sensitivity (e.g. compared to 
SnO2)  and  low  conductivity  requiring  higher  operation  temperatures 
[192]. 

Probably  the  first  flame-made  TiO2  gas  sensors  were  prepared  by 
FWD of mostly (85 wt%) anatase and exhibited n-type sensor responses 
to isoprene, acetone and ethanol (1 to 75 ppm) in dry air and 500 
C 
[94]. Doping with Nb tripled their response to 300 ppm ethanol at 400 
◦
C with an optimal Nb doping level at 2 at% for sensing CO and 3 at% for 
sensing acetone and ethanol [156]. Nanocrystalline Nb2O5 was detected 
at higher (e.g. 10 at%) Nb content [155] similar to excess Si-doping of 
SnO2 (Fig. 22). 

◦

The capacity of FSP to easily form mixed oxides or their solid solu-
tions (chapter 3.1) motivated FAD and in situ flame annealing of Sn1- 
xTixO2 [70]. These sensors improved ethanol response up to four times 
◦
for 0< x < 0.05 than SnO2  at 320 
C and 60% RH. At x = 0.046, the 
cross-sensitivity to humidity was reduced by 4 – 6 times (for 20 – 60% 
RH)  than that of  pure SnO2  due to the  Ti presence  on the  Sn1-xTixO2 
particle  surface. This  reduced the  number of  rooted and terminal hy-
droxyl species, as shown by Raman and DRIFTS. 

Highly porous (more than 90%) TiO2 films (Fig. 28a) were obtained 
by intermittent FAD onto off-centered rotating sensor substrates from 
premixed  CH4–O2  flames  fed  with  titanium  tetraisopropoxide  (TTIP) 
vapor  [97].  Such  films  (Fig.  28b)  were  densified  by  wetting  with  an 
◦
ethylcellulose (15 wt%) in ethanol solution and annealing at 600 
C for 
4 h. They featured about three times higher response to 25 – 250 ppm CO 
in dry air and 500 
C (Fig. 28c, squares) than FWD films of the same 
TiO2  (circles) as well as commercial flame-made TiO2  (P25, triangles). 
Such results indicate that films made by FAD result in distinctly better 
sensing  performance  than  conventionally  DC  [155]  or  DB  films 
(Fig. 28c, squares vs. circles) with similar (dp  = 8 or 8.8 nm, respec-
tively)  particles  and  annealing  conditions.  On  the  other  hand,

Titania  particles  containing  Au  (0.25  –  0.75  mol%)  [158]  and  Pt 
(0.25 – 3 mol%) [160] were prepared by FWD onto sensor substrates. 
The  addition  of  0.75  or  2  mol%  of  Au  or  Pt,  respectively,  enhanced 
strongly the sensitivity to 0.1 – 1 vol% H2 over that of pure TiO2 at 300

but  not  better  than  the  1  wt% Pt/WO3  [140]  in  chapter 4.2.  Mostly 
anatase (95%) TiO2 was made by FSP when doped with 0 – 10 mol% Cr 
◦
for sensing H2 at 350 
C in dry air [159]. A transition from n- to p-type 
semiconductor  (chapter  2)  was  observed  from  0  to  1  to  5–10  mol% 
Cr-doped TiO2 in sensing H2. 

4.5. Other materials 

Besides the above four MOx, various other materials have been made 
in flames for gas sensing. For example, Zn-doped maghemite (γ-Fe2O3) 
particles were made by FWD of ultrasonically nebulizing aqueous zinc 
and iron nitrate solutions into oxyhydrogen diffusion flames [162]. Such 
sensors featured a strong response to 250 –1
000 ppm acetone and H2 at

325 
C in dry air. This was, at least, an order of magnitude higher than 
◦
Nb-doped TiO2 at 400 
C [156] but it was lost upon annealing. Flak et al. 
[193] made γ-Fe2O3 by FSP that was air annealed to hematite α-Fe2O3.

Also γ-Fe2O3 nanoparticles were produced by spraying iron nitrate in 
ethanol solutions into an oxyhydrogen flame and coated in flight [194] 
with  a  6  –  20  nm  thick  SnO2  shell  by  injecting  SnCl4  into  the  Fe2O3 
plume [164]. Sensors of such nanoparticles were made by FWD (prob-
◦
ably [195] by DC) and annealing (7 days at 300 
C). Their responses to 5 
–  200 ppm ethanol in dry air were twice and thrice higher than pure 
SnO2  and  γ-Fe2O3  sensors.  This  was  attributed  to  the  heterojunctions 
formed at the core-shell interface. Although these sensors had limited 
selectivity  over  acetone (1.4),  acetic  acid (4) and  NH3  (12)  and  their 
response was lower than Si-doped SnO2 sensors (Fig. 22), they featured 
faster response (e.g. ~10 vs. ~120 s) and recovery (~20 vs. ~360 s) 
times to 10 ppm ethanol, perhaps due to their very thin SnO2 shells [17]. 
Pure  and  highly  porous  In2O3  films  that  were  made  by  FAD  [22] 
showed  good  sensitivity  to  formaldehyde,  a  carcinogenic  indoor  air 
pollutant (chapter 5.3.3), to even below 100 ppb at 50% RH [165]. This 
was  improved  by  the  addition  of  Sn  into  the  FSP  precursor  solution

Pt, Nb and Ru for sensing NO2. The highest NO2 response (17 to 0.125

Pt-doped WO3 sensors at 150

Also, p-type Co3O4 and CuO sensors were made by FAD [22] to detect 
300 – 800 ppb NO2 at 50% RH at 150 
C [26]. Upon exposure to NO2, 
their resistance decreased [26] that has been associated to the increased 
majority  carrier  concentration  of  positive  charges  (holes)  formed  by 
ionosorption of NO2 [45]. Thereby, CuO featured a higher NO2 response 
than Co3O4 (12 vs. 0.3 to 800 ppb) but lower than WO3 sensors (Fig. 4c, 
circles). The sensitivity of p-type oxides (e.g. Co3O4 or CuO) is typically 
just equal to the square root of the sensitivity of n-type oxides (e.g. WO3) 
at  identical  morphology  and  surface  chemistry,  as  derived  from  con-
duction  modeling  [197]  in  the  chemoresistive  layer  or  porous  films 
(Fig. 3). 

Orthorhombic α-MoO3  features distinct  ammonia selectivity  [198] 
that might be related to MoO3’s surface acidity that is one of the highest 
among  most MOx  [189],  similar to acetic acid’s  selectivity  on Y-con-
taining ZnO that featured high surface basicity (Fig. 26). A filamentary 
FAD Si-doped MoO3 more than doubled the sensor response (with SNR >
15) to 1 ppm of NH3 and enhanced its selectivity to acetone (3.6) and NO

(8) than platelet-like MoO3 at 400 
C in dry air (Fig. 30) [73]. While its 
response was higher than Au-loaded ZnO blended with polymer (< 0.1 
to  25  ppm  in  dry  air)  [151],  the  latter  had  been  obtained  at  room 
temperature. 

Also, Bi2WO6  perovskite nanoparticles were prepared by FSP with 
(cid:0) 1) than that by hydrothermal 
more than twice the SSA (i.e. 198 m2 g

sensing  farm  emissions  [199],  food  degradation  [200]  and  illnesses

higher than that of Au-loaded ZnO-polymer sensors (< 0.1) to 25 ppm in 
dry  air  as  was  discussed  in  chapter  4.3.  This  sensor  response  was 
reversible and rapid (2 min) for room temperature sensors, as indicated 
by  the  full  recovery  of  the  baseline  after  the  exposure  to  5000  ppb 
(dashed line, Fig. 31). Such porous CuBr sensors showed high ammonia 
(at  500  ppb)  selectivity  over  isoprene  (32),  ethanol  (39),  CH4  (49), 
acetone (57), hydrogen, acetic acid (both 59), methanol (66), formal-
dehyde (185) and CO (260). This was superior to other NH3 sensors, for 
instance CuO [26], that was less selective (< 10) to ethanol or formal-
dehyde. The outstanding NH3 selectivity of CuBr has been associated to 
Cu
ions that are immobilized upon exposure to NH3 by forming stable

ammine complexes such as Cu(NH3)2

[202].

By injecting an aqueous suspension of palladium nitrate and rGO into 
a hydrogen-rich flame [170], crumbled rGO balls decorated with fine 
(less than 5 nm) Pd nanoparticles were made and dispersed in isopropyl 
alcohol and  drop-casted onto sensor substrates followed  by overnight 
drying at 80 
C and degassing. Such sensors detected 2 vol% H2 with a 
response of 0.15 and response time of 73 s in dry air at room temperature 
which is a critical feature for sensing flammable gasses like H2  where 
heated sensors represent a potential source of ignition.

5. Devices 

Practical applications of gas sensing typically involve gas mixtures. 
As  such,  it  is  difficult  for  a  single  sensor  to  meet  the  3S  challenges 
(sensitivity,  selectivity  and  stability)  with  attractive  response  and  re-
covery  times.  Subsequently,  sensing  devices  are  assembled  by  a) 
combining several sensors, the so-called arrays or electronic noses (e- 
noses) and b) removing most interferants or confounders upstream of 
the sensor by separation or sorting units (sorption columns, molecular 
sieves  or  catalysts), the  so-called filters, to  facilitate the sensing  task. 
Here the assembly and operation of such devices containing flame-made 
materials are highlighted along with distinct applications. 

5.1. Sensor arrays or E-noses 

Sensor arrays are called also E-noses as they mimic the mammalian 
olfactory system with its high sensitivity and discrimination capacity for 
odors  [203].  Combining  differently-selective  sensors  to  an  array  and 
statistically  processing  their  responses  can  enhance  the  selectivity  of 
single sensors. 

The  first  flame-made  sensor  array,  to  the  best  of  our  knowledge, 
consisted of four FAD SnO2 sensors each doped with 1 wt% Pt, Pd, Si and 
Ti and wire-suspended on a single chip carrier to minimize heat losses

to specific analytes as some of the flame-made ones presented in the last 
chapter (e.g. Si-doped WO3 for acetone [138], In4Sn3O12 for formalde-
hyde [165] or Pd-doped SnO2 for H2 [119]) the array performance can 
be  improved  drastically.  Combining  such  sensors  into  arrays  can  in-
crease their orthogonality and improve their discrimination power and 
thus accuracy in quantifying multiple analytes [185]. For example, FAD 
Si-doped MoO3  (with high ammonia selectivity, Fig. 30) and Si-doped 
WO3  (exhibiting  high  acetone  selectivity,  Fig.  23b)  were  combined 
with a Si-doped SnO2 sensor (exhibiting high ethanol sensitivity Fig. 22) 
to form an array featuring higher orthogonality (Fig. 33a, shaded area) 
than  a  conventional  array  consisting  of  highly  sensitive  but 
weakly-selective  Pd-,  Pt-  and  Si-doped  SnO2  sensors  with  rather 
collinear characteristics to acetone, ethanol and NH3 (Fig. 33b, shaded 
area). The orthogonal array predicted NH3 concentrations between 250 
′
000 ppb quite accurately (R2  = 0.96) while the conventional one 
–  2
practically failed (R2  = 0.01). Most importantly the NH3  prediction of 
the  array  was  improved  also  over  that  of  the  single  Si-doped  MoO3 
sensor (R2 = 0.68) proving the value of the orthogonal array. 

Capitalizing on this concept, an array containing distinctly selective 
FAD and in situ annealed gas sensors was applied to track breath- and 
skin-emitted  volatiles  from  enclosed  humans  in  a  plethysmography 
chamber (Fig. 34a) to mimic entrapment (e.g. under earthquake rubble) 
that  is  crucial  for  urban  search  and  rescue  [186].  So  in  the  above 
orthogonal array (Fig. 33a) the Si-doped SnO2 sensor was replaced by a 
Ti-doped ZnO sensor (Fig. 4b) featuring high selectivity to isoprene, a 
byproduct  of  human  cholesterol  biosynthesis  [208].  Including  com-
mercial  CO2  and  RH  sensors  in  that  array  further  strengthened  its 
orthogonality  [185].  As  a  result,  sub-ppm  acetone,  NH3  and  isoprene 
were detected with high accuracy (3–21 ppb) and precision as bench-
marked  with  state-of-the-art  mass  spectrometers  (Fig.  34b,  hatched 
boxes). This was a significant improvement over the constituent single 
sensors  that  had  4  –  28  times  higher  estimation  errors  for  sensing 
isoprene, NH3 and acetone (Fig. 34b, open boxes). 

While sensor arrays can overcome the selectivity limitations of single 
sensors  in  gas  mixtures,  this  comes  at  the  expense  of  increasing 
complexity. More specifically, additional sensors need to be integrated 
while  the  processing  of  evaluation  algorithms  requires  enhanced 
computational  power.  Furthermore,  arrays  are  more  susceptible  to 
instability  as  performance  deterioration  of  a  constituent  sensor  (e.g. 
drift)  can  compromise  the  entire  array,  if  not  compensated  by  algo-
rithms [209].

FAD films of Pt-, Pd-, Si- and Ti-doped SnO2. Reprinted from [33]. 

(Fig. 32). By combining individual sensor responses with a multivariate 
linear regression algorithm [204], formaldehyde was detected down to 3 
ppb at 90% RH. Furthermore, relevant 30 –  180 ppb of formaldehyde 
were  distinguished  in  its  mixtures  with  up  to  an  order  of  magnitude 
higher ethanol, acetone and NH3  concentrations [33], superior to the 
constituent  single  sensors  that  are  interfered  by  these  gasses.  For 
example Pd-doped SnO2 responds similarly to ethanol and acetone [63]. 
This array, however, suffered from increasing estimation errors with 
increasing  gas  mixture  complexity  due  to  the  rather  collinear  and 
broadly  sensitive  nature  of  the  constituent  sensors  lowering  its 
discrimination  power  [185].  As  a  result,  single  chemical  species  in 
real-world gas mixtures (e.g. indoor air, human breath) can hardly be 
quantified selectively, a key shortcoming of such conventional arrays. In 
an attempt to circumvent this, arrays that had been applied to detect 
odors (e.g. coffee [205]) and disease-related breath compositions (e.g. 
lung cancer vs. healthy [206]) used response pattern analysis without 
identifying  the  underlying  analytes.  A  key  concern,  however,  is  the 
susceptibility to pseudo-correlations of such response patterns as these 
may be generated by confounders rather than the actual target analytes 
[207].

5.2. Filters 

Filters  enhance  the  selectivity  of  sensors  for  specific  analytes  by 
removing unwanted interferants or confounders based on their molec-
ular  size,  sorption  affinity  or  catalytic  reactions  (Fig.  35).  The  early 
impact of such filters on the selectivity of gas sensors was brought for-
ward by Morrison [210] and most recently by van den Broek et al. [37] 
who  reviewed  over  300  pertinent  articles  with  guidelines  for  filter 
design in air quality, health and food applications. 

5.2.1. Sorption filters 

When  analytes  and  confounders feature different  affinity to  a  sur-
face, they can be separated by sorption (i.e. ad- or ab-sorption) filters. 
Packed beds of these materials are used as filters similar to chromato-
graphic  columns.  Probably  the  first  sorption  filters  were  based  on 
charcoal granules to mitigate poisoning of pellistor-type CH4 sensors by 
hexamethyl disiloxane [211]. Such filters worked well, hardly affecting 
the sensor response, while finer granules lasted longer as they had more 
surface area per unit mass. 

More recently a packed bed of activated Al2O3 was used as a filter of 
polar compounds ahead of an FAD and in situ annealed Pt-doped SnO2 
sensor (Fig. 36a) for detection of isoprene at 90% RH [212]. That way 
hydrophilic ketones, NH3  and alcohols were retained on Al2O3  and its 
adsorbed  water  layer  (Fig.  36b)  while  hydrophobic  isoprene  passed 
through and was detected selectively (> 100) down to 5 ppb in such 
mixtures. This device was superior to isoprene sensors made with FAD 
Ti-doped ZnO [54], ZnO quantum dots [213], ZnO manually mixed with 
Au  nanoparticles  [214]  or  hydrothermally-made  In2O3  nanoflowers 
[215]. Similar to Gentry and Howarth [211], the fast (10 s) response and 
recovery times of the above sensor were not compromised by the Al2O3

Fig. 36. Sorption filter-sensor concept: (a) A gas mixture (e.g. human breath) is 
filtered through a packed bed of activated alumina beads upstream of a non- 
selective  gas  sensor.  (b)  Hydrophilic  analytes  (e.g.  acetone,  NH3,  ethanol, 
methanol, etc.) are retained on Al2O3 and its adsorbed water layer. In contrast,

lective detection down to low ppb in real-time. Reprinted from [212]. 

filter that ran flawlessly for days [212]. 

Even analytes of the same chemical family can be distinguished with 
such sorption filters, a longstanding challenge for chemical sensors, by 
capitalizing on the elution or retention time difference between analytes 
through these filters, analogous to gas chromatography [216, 217]. For 
example,  by  placing  a  column  of  commercial  polymeric  (Tenax  TA) 
particles  ahead  of  the  above  Pd-doped  SnO2  sensor  (Fig.  37a),  the 
concentration of methanol was quantified in its mixture with H2, ethanol 
and  acetone (b,c)  [216]. That  way,  1  –  1
000  ppm  of  methanol  were 
detected within 2 min in the presence of much higher ethanol concen-
trations (up to 50 vol%). Interfacing this detector to a smartphone with 
an app, led to the assembly of probably the first-ever hand-held device to 
reliably  sense  methanol  in  spiked  hand-sanitizers,  liquors  and  even 
during their distillation as well as in actual breath samples of intoxicated 
people as it will be shown in chapter 5.3. 

′

This detector can be used also for highly selective sensing of form-
aldehyde by enlarging its filter and prolonging the short elution time of 
formaldehyde  compared  to  those  of  methanol  and  heavier  VOCs 
(Fig.  38a)  [217].  That  way,  formaldehyde  was  detected  selectively 
down to 5 ppb within 2 min (Fig. 38b) at indoor-relevant 45% RH and

acetaldehyde concentrations. As a result, this detector fulfills even the 
strictest upcoming exposure guidelines for this carcinogenic [218] air 
pollutant in France of 8 ppb by 2023 [219]). 

5.2.2. Catalytic filters 

These  filters  prescreen  sensors  by  continuously  removing  con-
founders that are converted to inert species while preserving the target 
analyte.  For  confounders  in  the  background  (e.g.  ethanol  from  disin-
fectants in hospitals), this concept is superior to the above sorption fil-
ters where confounders are only retained temporarily and break through

bols) a Pd-containing Al2O3 overlayer as a function of CH4 concentration in dry

after a characteristic time, the so-called elution or retention time [212]. 
Also catalytic filters are an alternative to microporous membranes [100] 
when molecular size differences between the analyte (e.g. isoprene, 5.5 
Å [220]) and confounders (e.g. ethanol, 4.3 Å [99]) are small. 

◦

Probably the first catalytic filters were screen-printed Pt-containing 
Al2O3  particles onto SnO2  sensors that removed completely interfering 
CO while their CH4  sensitivity remained intact at 500 
C [221]. Such 
filters  can  be  deposited  directly  on  top  of  sensing  films  also  by 
flame-aerosol technology enabling a compact layer-by-layer integration 
onto sensors (Fig. 14). For example, a filter for a single confounder (i.e. 
water  vapor)  was  developed  by  multilayer  FAD  of  <20  µm  thick 
Pd-containing  Al2O3  layers  on  top  of  SnO2  films  to  remove  their 
cross-sensitivity to RH and double their response to CH4 (Fig. 39) at dry 
conditions  [28].  Most  likely  CH3  radicals  that  were  created  as  CH4 
flowed through the porous Pd-containing Al2O3 layer lowered the acti-
vation energy for C–H bond dissociation on SnO2, thereby enhancing its 
sensitivity.  In  sensing  CO,  the  influence  of  RH  was  mitigated  equally 
well, but sensor responses were lower than those of pure SnO2. This was 
attributed to partial oxidation of CO in the filter layer, so less CO reached 

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience90(2022)10099224A.T. Güntner et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             

the SnO2  sensing film. Such FAD and Pd-containing Al2O3  overlayered 
SnO2  sensors  showed  comparable  CO  responses  to  similarly  prepared 
0.2 wt% Pt-containing SnO2  [22] but higher ones than vapor-fed FAD 
TiO2 (Fig. 28c) and FWD ZnO [146]. 

◦

Catalytic  filters  can  be  self-standing  also  as  with  one  for  ethanol 
consisting  of  a  packed-bed  of  flame-made  ZnO  [222]  nanoparticles 
[223].  By  capitalizing  on  its  high  ethanol  reactivity  at  220 
C  and 
placing  it ahead of  an FAD Si-doped  WO3  sensor [138], it selectively 
removed ethanol over the target analytes acetone (Fig. 40), CH4, H2, 
toluene and benzene at 30 – 90% RH. This filter continuously oxidized 
ethanol  up  to  20  ppm  while  preserving  acetone  (a  breath  tracer  of 
lipolysis [224]) as low as 0.025 ppm. This was attributed to ZnO’s high 
surface basicity compared to other catalytic materials [223]. In fact, the 
catalytic  conversion  of  acetone  requires  adsorptive  interaction  of  its 
carbonyl group with Lewis acid sites [225], that are hardly available on 
ZnO [223]. Ethanol, on the other hand, is oxidized by interaction with 
oxygen-  and  hydroxyl‑related  species  [226].  This  was  confirmed  by 
other, more acidic materials [223], including CuO [227], SnO2  [228] 
and Fe2O3  [229], that did not exhibit such distinct ethanol-selectivity 
over acetone. 

Catalytic filters can be used also to remove several interferants and 
enhance the sensor selectivity to a specific compound. So by replacing 
the  above  ZnO  particles  with  flame-made  Pt-doped  Al2O3  ones  [230] 
(Fig. 41a), this detector exhibited unprecedented acetone selectivity (>
250)  over  the  most  challenging interferants  (e.g.  alcohols,  aldehydes, 
aromatics,  isoprene,  ammonia,  H2  and  CO)  at  90%  RH  (Fig.  41b,c) 
[231].  Thereby,  also  CO  [232],  toluene,  isoprene  and  formaldehyde 
[233] are catalytically converted by hydroxyl groups on the Al2O3 sur-
face at such high relative humidity, similarly to ethanol, as discussed 
above. In contrast, Lewis sites, required for acetone conversion [225], 
are deactivated by dissociation and chemisorption of water molecules 
[234],  as  confirmed  by  measurements  at  dry  conditions  [231]. 
Furthermore, Brønsted sites, that convert acetone even at humid con-
ditions,  are  hardly  available  on  Al2O3  surfaces  [235].  Finally,  the  Pt 
promotes  the  catalytic  conversion,  lowering  the  operational  tempera-
ture even down to room temperature at higher loading (e.g. 3 mol% Pt 
[236]). This selectivity was superior to that of single FAD and in situ 
annealed Si-containing WO3 sensors (Fig. 23b). That way, acetone was 
quantified with fast response (< 1 min) down to, at least, 50 ppb in gas 
mixtures with such interferants having up to two orders of magnitude 
higher concentrations at RH = 30 – 90%. Most importantly, this filter

converts  interferants  continuously  enabling  highly  selective  acetone 
sensing  even  in  the  exhaled  breath  of  volunteers  during  exercise  and 
short-term fasting  (ca. 15  h), in  excellent agreement with  “gold stan-
dard”  proton  transfer  reaction  time-of-flight  mass  spectrometry 
(PTR-ToF-MS)  measurements  as  it  is  shown  in  the  next  chapter.  The 
detector exhibited stable performance over, at least, 145 days at 90% 
RH, as validated by PTR-ToF-MS. Note that this filter removed ~23% of 
the acetone, similar to Pd-doped Al2O3 overlayers with CO [28]. 

5.3. Device development and emerging applications 

The capacity of flame aerosol technology to form sensing materials 
with unique morphology and composition create distinct opportunities 
for combustion processes in established as well as emerging applications 
of gas sensors. In fact, the application dictates the detailed design of such 
devices  even  though  identical  device  components  (filters  or  sensors) 
might be used in different applications. Here some examples are pre-
sented with the impact of this technology in breath analysis, food quality 
assessment and air quality monitoring. 

5.3.1. Breath analysis 

Human breath is rich in physiological information, always accessible 
and can be measured less invasively than blood or urine assays [237]. In 
principle,  breath  analysis  can  track  physiological  parameters,  detect 
diseases  and  monitor  their  progression  by  tracing  related  molecules. 
Table 3 summarizes some of these molecules (analytes), their physio-
logical  origin,  status  (normal  or  not)  and  corresponding  average 
concentrations. 

The key challenge in breath analysis is the selective detection of trace 
analytes (typically at ppb) among over eight hundred of them [261] at 
high humidity (over 90% RH). Nowadays, mixed exhaled breath or a

particular  fraction  of  it  (e.g.  end-tidal  [262])  are  sampled  and  either 
analyzed directly [263] or collected and stored [264] for offsite evalu-
ation  (Fig.  42)  by  gas  chromatography,  mass  spectrometry,  optical 
techniques and gas sensors [265]. That way, breath marker concentra-
tions are quantified accurately to monitor longitudinal trends which are 
communicated  to  the  user  or  health  expert  for  diagnostic  and  thera-
peutic purposes [20]. 

Gas  sensors  are  most  attractive  for  breath  analysis  due  to  their 
portability and low cost with some of them being already commercially 
available for ethanol, NO, CH4 and H2 (Table 1). The major challenge to 
date  remains  the  limited  availability  of  highly  sensitive  and  selective 
sensing devices with validated performance on humans [266]. This is an 
opportunity  for  flame-made  materials  with  their  stable  capture  of 
metastable  phases  (chapter  3.1).  In  particular  for  the  detection  of 
breath acetone, flame-made WO3-based sensors proved to be quite se-
lective compared to common interferants (Fig. 23a). However, having 
such  a  material  is  only  the  starting  point  in  the  assembly  of  the 

corresponding breath analyzers. 

For such a portable analyzer with flame-made gas sensors, acetone- 
selective Si-doped WO3  (Fig. 23b) was FAD and in situ annealed onto 
compact  (15  × 13  mm2)  alumina  substrates  with  interdigitated  Pt 
electrodes  (Fig.  43a)  [32].  When  mounted  onto  a  Macor  holder 
(Fig. 43b) and placed inside a Teflon chamber, such sensors were con-
nected to a respiratory flow monitored mask for online breath analysis. 
Then the breath acetone dynamics of volunteers were followed closely 
during exercising, as confirmed by concurrent mass spectrometer mea-
surements of acetone. By collecting breath samples in Tedlar bags from 
volunteers  after  overnight  fasting,  such  sensors  were  tested  offline 
[182]. Using this WO3 sensor, a portable breath analyzer prototype was 
developed with Loccioni SA (Italy) [266]. 

Measuring exhaled acetone, a volatile byproduct of lipolysis [224], 
with a portable device enables also personal monitoring of lipolysis (or 
body  fat  burning)  [242].  Therefore,  an  end-tidal  breath  sampler 
(Fig.  43c,d)  [267]  was  coupled  to  the  above  sensor  (Fig.  43b)  and 

Fig.  42. Sequence of  breath  analysis: Exhaled  breath is  sampled and  analyzed directly  or stored  in containers  (e.g. bags or  sorption traps). Breath  markers  are 
quantified with a sensor or an array and displayed on electronic devices and communicated to health experts. Adapted from [54, 223].

tested on 11 volunteers during a 36-h long ketogenic diet [184]. Then, 
the sensor correctly recognized the strong breath acetone increase up to 
27 ppm of volunteer #11 (triangles, Fig. 43e) within 24 h of dieting 
corresponding  to  mild  ketosis  (BOHB  2  –  7  mM  [268],  Fig.  43f).  In 
contrast, dieting was less effective for volunteers #3 (diamonds,) and 
#10 (stars) that hardly changed (< 10 ppm) their breath acetone levels 
within 24 h of dieting and only entered nutritional ketosis (BHOB 0.5 – 
3 mM [269]) thereafter. These results showed the immediate practical 
impact  of  such  flame-made  sensors  by  providing  non-invasive  and 
routine  feed-back  on  ketosis  that  is  required  also  in  the  treatment  of 
epilepsy [270]. 

More challenging is the monitoring of lipolysis during exercise since 
finer acetone dynamics (e.g. between 0.2 and 2.4 ppm [183]) need to be 
resolved.  When  testing  the  above  breath  sampler  and  Si-doped  WO3 
sensor  on  20  volunteers  during  constant-load  exercise  and  rest,  the 

sensor  response  correlated  well  (r  = 0.97)  with  high-resolution 
PTR-ToF-MS for acetone and BOHB. However, further studies during a 
ramped-load exercise protocol revealed that the Si/WO3 sensor acetone 
measurements (squares, Fig. 44a) were interfered by exercise-induced 
breath  isoprene  (triangles,  b)  and  hand  sanitizer-released  ethanol 
(stars, b) [137]. This caused breath acetone overpredictions up to 110% 
(i.e. after 5 min, Fig. 44a, squares) that were eliminated by placing a 
flame-made Pt/Al2O3  catalytic filter (Fig. 41a) upstream of the sensor 
(circles, Fig. 44a), as verified by PTR-ToF-MS (inverted triangles). This 
significantly improved bias (sensor with vs. without filter: 25 vs. 271 
ppb)  and  precision  (169  vs.  442  ppb)  for  breath  acetone  detection, 
outperforming  also  state-of-the-art  sensors  like  LEVL  (Table  1)  that 
′
featured a bias and precision of 1
000 ppb. This exemplified the impact 
of flame-made filters on the performance of sensors enabling accurate 
breath analysis even during exercise.

Another  critical  application  of  the  above  filter-sensor  device 
(Fig. 37a) is the early detection of methanol poisoning from the con-
sumption of adulterated alcoholic beverages (Fig. 45a). Methanol cau-
ses blindness and hundreds of fatalities every year, worldwide, and it is 
difficult  to  be  distinguished  from  common  alcohol  intoxication  that 
share unfortunately the same symptoms [216]. Methanol was quantified 
accurately in 105 methanol-spiked breath samples from 20 volunteers 
(Fig. 45b) after consumption of liquor (squares), wine (triangles), beer 
(diamonds) or water (circles) [271]. Most importantly, lower thresholds 
for the clinical treatment of methanol poisoning with antidote and he-
modialysis treatment were recognized reliably with this device that is 
readily applicable as a point-of-care diagnostic tool for first responders 
and  critical  care  workers.  It  should  be  noted  here  that  the  critical 
component of the device (Fig. 37a) is the filter rather than the sensor as 
with  the  above  flame-made  Pt-doped  Al2O3  filter  and  Si/WO3  sensor 
[137]. 

5.3.2. Food safety 

By  2050,  the  world  population  is  expected  to  grow  to  9.7  billion 
people  [272]  with  food  safety  being  a  major  challenge  in  light  of 
restricted  resources  [273].  Convenient  and  low-cost  food  quality  de-
tectors can play a pivotal role to optimize food production by screening 
for  markers  of  ripening  (e.g.  the  plant  hormone  ethylene  [274]), 
spoilage (e.g. NH3, putrescine and cadaverine for meat [200]) or identify 
hazardous  compounds  (e.g.  methanol  in  alcoholic  beverages  [275]). 
Particularly difficult for food quality detectors is the discrimination of 

Fig. 45. (a) After ingestion of methanol (contained, for instance, in adulterated 
alcoholic  beverages),  it  is  converted  in  the  liver  by  alcohol  dehydrogenase 
(ADH)  and  formate  dehydrogenase  (FDH)  to  toxic  formaldehyde  and  formic 
acid, respectively. Through diffusion in the lung alveoli from blood into breath, 
methanol is exhaled where it can be detected with sensors. (b) Methanol con-
centration  from  20  volunteers  (105  samples)  after  consumption  of  liquor

(Fig.  37a)  and  bench-top  PTR-ToF-MS.  Breath  samples  were  spiked  with

depending on liquor composition [277]) is indicated by a

discussed in chapter 5.2.1, a rapid methanol screening tool for alco-
holic  beverages  was  assembled  (Fig.  37a)  into  a  palm-sized,  light--
weight  (94  g)  and  low-cost  device  (Fig.  46a)  [38].  Wireless 
communication through WiFi or Bluetooth with a smartphone-enabled 
simple device control and display of the results (Fig. 46b) in real-time. 
Most importantly, this device quantified methanol between 0.01 – 
10 vol% accurately in the head-space of 89 pure and methanol-spiked 
drinks  (i.e.  beer,  Sake,  wine,  Baileys,  Arrack,  Stroh  rum,  cherry  and 
pear  spirit)  from  six  continents  (Fig.  46c,d)  with  stable  performance 
over, at least, 107 days. As a result, this device is readily usable by in-
dividuals and authorities (e.g. police or customs) while it is capable also 
to  detect  methanol  poisoning  in  exhaled  human  breath  (Fig.  45)  by 
healthcare workers as discussed just above. 

Methanol contamination has become also an issue in hand sanitizers 
as their global demand has increased rapidly during the COVID-19 crisis. 
By  Feb.  2021,  the  U.S.  FDA  had  blacklisted  230  products  [278]  con-
taining up to 81 vol% of toxic methanol, which is significantly above 
recommended  limits  (i.e.  0.063  vol%  [279]).  Using  the  above  device 
(Fig. 46a,b), seven commercially available and methanol-spiked hand 
sanitizers with various compositions were tested [39]. That way spiked 
methanol was quantified from 0 to 90 vol% in sanitizer #5 (Fig. 47a) 
without  interference  by  other  constituents  (81  vol%  ethanol  next  to 
panthenol, 
cyclopentasiloxane, 
isotrideceth-8,  didecyldimethylammoniumchloride  and  2-propanol). 
This also included the above FDA limit that was distinguished clearly 
from 0.01 to 0.1 vol% (Fig. 47a, inset). Spiked methanol was quantified 
even in a gel-like sanitizer (#7, Fig. 47b) with exceptional R2  of 0.99 
demonstrating  the  robustness  of  headspace  analysis  against  sample 
viscosity  that  should  compromise  colorimetric  assays  (e.g.  Alert  for 
Methanol).  Most 
importantly,  this  device  revealed  that  some 
fruit-derived antiseptics exceed the above FDA limit for methanol!

Very recently,  this  device  monitored  in  situ the  methanol  concen-
tration during liquor distillation (196 cherry, plum, apple and herb spirit 
samples)  in  an  industrial  distillery  (Fig.  48a).  During  two  hours  of 
distillation, naturally occurring methanol levels between 0.1 to 1.25 vol 
% were continuously traced (within 2 min) without bias and with high 
precision  (0.082  vol%),  in  good  agreement  with  much  bulkier  gas 
chromatography.  Neither  composition  (e.g.  aromas,  highly  volatile 
compounds  from  early  distillates  like  acetaldehyde)  nor  distillate  in-
homogeneities,  like  fruit  pulp  in  mash,  interfered  the  methanol  mea-
surement by this device. 

As this device is capable to quantify simultaneously also the ethanol

While  low-cost  sensors  already  exist  for  particulate  matter  (PM), 
sensors  to  selectively  track  gaseous  pollutants  are  hardly  available. 
Current  air  quality sensors  are  either inaccurate or  they  can measure 
only accumulated concentrations over entire groups of chemicals (e.g. 
total VOC, Table 1), unable to differentiate harmful from harmless ones 
[8].  Subsequently  selective,  low-power  and  inexpensive  air  quality 
sensors are needed. 

A  challenging  indoor  air  pollutant  is  carcinogenic  formaldehyde 
[218]  with  a  WHO  exposure  limit  at  80  ppb  [284].  While  there  are 
already  flame-made  sensors  for  formaldehyde  (Table  2),  they  either 
have  too  high  LDL  [136]  or  have  not  been  tested  in  the  presence  of 
multiple interferants (Fig. 29) as it will be the case for formaldehyde in 
an indoor environment. In fact, the estimation error for FA detection by 
an FAD sensor array (Fig. 32) increased as the number of interferants 
increased even though its LDL was just 3 ppb [33]. 

To  meet  the  above  stringent  formaldehyde  exposure  limits  in  the 
presence of interferants at much higher concentrations than formalde-
hyde, the  filter-sensor device  (Fig. 37a)  with  its  promising formalde-
hyde  sensitivity  (Fig.  38)  was  tested  on  differently  treated  wood 
products  (Fig.  49a).  The  emitted  formaldehyde  was  distinguished 
clearly  from  non-retained  interfering  compounds  (e.g.  H2),  methanol, 
acetaldehyde and ethanol (Fig. 49b). For example, the highest formal-
dehyde response was detected from medium-density fiberboards (MDF, 
dashed  line)  where  urea-formaldehyde-based  adhesives  are  typically 
used  [287].  That  way,  emitted  formaldehyde  concentrations  were 
quantified  accurately  (average  error  10  ppb)  between  18  –  270  ppb 
regardless of the wood concentration (1 – 5 m2 of wood surface area per

guide distillers to avoid illegal methanol concentrations in their prod-
ucts and prevent poisoning. For example, Fig. 48b shows the methanol 
per  pure  ethanol  content  during  plum  (triangles)  and  apple  (circles) 
distillation [281] identifying liquor adherence to the E.U. legal limit (i.e. 
1
200  g  methanol  per  hL  ethanol  [280]).  Such  infraction  occured 
temporarily  in  plum  and  apple  distillates  after  around  60  to  90  min 
distillation, respectively, when their ethanol contents drop.

5.3.3. Air quality monitoring 

Around  96%  of  urban  populations  are  frequently  exposed  to 
pollutant  concentrations  exceeding  the  recommended  limits  [282]. 
Respiratory  diseases  such  as  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease, 
lung cancer, and pneumonia, but also coronary heart disease and stroke 
have  been  associated  with  prolonged  exposure  to  air  pollutants,  ac-
cording to the WHO [283]. Table 4 summarizes the origin and exposure 
limits of some important air pollutants. 

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience90(2022)10099230A.T. Güntner et al.

(Fig. 49c). 

This  device  has  been  tested  also  on  real  (squares,  Fig.  50a)  and 
spiked indoor air with formaldehyde (circles). Quite remarkably, rele-
vant formaldehyde concentrations between 15 and 500 ppb including 
the WHO limit and the threshold for sensory irritation (Fig. 50a) were 
detected accurately and in excellent agreement (R2 = 0.996) again with 
PTR-ToF-MS. 

This  device  is  low-cost and  suitable  for  frequent  on-site  formalde-
hyde  analyses  in  hospitals  (e.g.  histology,  pathology  and  mortuary 
rooms where formaldehyde-containing solutions are applied for tissue 
preservation)  or  even  monitoring  in  new  houses  or  critical  industries 
complementing current expensive and time-consuming techniques that 
rely on tedious sampling and off-site analysis in specialized laboratories. 
Such devices can be connected also to and regulate air exchange and 
purification  systems  in  “smart  buildings”  [288]  reducing  heating  and 
electric energy consumption (Fig. 50b). 

6. Conclusions and outlook 

Gas sensors offer exciting opportunities for combustion scientists and

engineers  that  share  a  passion  for  functional  material  design  at  the 
nanoscale.  Therein,  flame  aerosol  technology  provides  some  key  ad-
vantages over traditional wet synthesis techniques owing to its distinc-
tive gas-to-solid particle formation route at well-controllable conditions 
today  with  its  rapid  attainment  of  asymptotic  size  distributions  and 
structures. In particular, the capacity of combustion to access readily a 
variety of materials (covering a significant share of the periodic table) 
even  at  complex  compositions  with  filamentary  morphology  is  most 
appealing. As a result, solid solutions, metastable crystal phases (from 
combustion’s steep  cooling  rates)  as  well  as  heterogeneous  structures 
like mixed oxides or noble-metals (NM) finely dispersed on and inside 
metal-oxides  (MOx)  can  be  obtained,  opening  new  avenues  to  truly 
unique sensing features and performance. 

Most attractive is their direct (and even in situ monitored, Fig. 16) 
FAD onto micro-circuitry. That way self-assembled highly porous and 
rigid sensing films of high purity are deposited in a single step (Fig. 7). 
This deposition mode leads to thrice higher sensor response (Fig. 28c) 
with much less  sensing material than that by standard wet chemistry 
deposition of the same flame-made particles. Such features have led to 

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience90(2022)10099231A.T. Güntner et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             

gas  sensing  devices  based  on  flame-made  materials  that  trace  single 
analytes at extremely low (ppb-level) concentrations among hundreds of 
interferants. As a result, these devices have distinct impact in emerging 
applications:  breath  analysis  (monitoring  lipolysis  by  breath  acetone, 
Fig. 43e,f), food safety (distinguish liquor adulteration by methanol in 
the  presence  of  up  to  30
000  times  higher  ethanol  concentrations, 
Fig.  46)  and  indoor  air  quality  (detect  in  situ  formaldehyde  in  gas 
mixtures, Fig. 49). 

′

Despite these promising developments, there is lack of mechanistic 
understanding of analyte interaction with most sensing materials, except 
for  pure  SnO2.  Consequently,  the  abundant  opportunities  for  sensing 
material compositions offered by combustion are pursued in an Ediso-
nian fashion rather than through a systematic and rational design. For 
instance, the depletion layer models described in chapter 2 elucidate 
how  surface  interactions  with analytes  translate into  electrical  sensor 
response.  But  these  models  are  simplified  for  homogeneous,  compact 
films  (Fig.  2),  single  nanoparticles/necked  agglomerates  (Fig.  3)  and 
treat  NM  dopants  only  as  surface  clusters  (as  suggested  in  chemical/ 
electronic  sensitization  models, Fig.  5).  These  should  be  advanced  to 
more sophisticated multi-component systems and heterogeneous mor-
phologies as typically is the case for flame-made sensors (Table 2). For 
example, combustion synthesis of NM onto the semiconducting support 
offers the co-existence of NM clusters on top and inside that support (e.g. 
Pd-containing SnO2, Fig. 20). Such a configuration can provide addi-
tional  conductive  and  sensing  pathways  that  may  have  never  been 
considered  before  as  wet  chemistry  sensor  synthesis  confines  such 
clusters solely on the support surface. Similarly, adsorption preference 
and reactivity are unknown for most analyte – material combinations. 
Here, a close interaction with the heterogeneous catalysis community 
can  facilitate  rational  material  selection  and  subsequently  selectivity 
optimization. In this regard, density functional theory (DFT) can provide 
insights  of  the  impact  of  noble  metal  doping  (e.g.,  Pd  [289]  and  Pt 
[290]) on the sensing mechanism of metal oxides. Interfacing such DFT 
simulations with multiscale modeling of flame-made nanomaterials [91] 
could facilitate the design of gas sensors from first principles. 

Sensor array and filter innovations (chapter 5) represent additional 
strategies to systematically enhance selectivity (perhaps the most chal-
lenging of the 3S) by exploiting distinct analyte properties (e.g. molec-
ular  size,  sorption  or  reactivity).  This  includes  leveraging  the 
aforementioned  advantages  of  combustion  technology  to  tailor  also 
nanosized  catalytic  [291]  filter  materials  that  oxidize  confounders 
selectively  and  continuously.  As  stated  above,  this  approach  yielded 
already  flame-made  gas  sensing  devices  with  validated  performance 
under real conditions. As a result, some of them coupled to gas chro-
matographic columns are well advanced for commercialization as with 
toxic  methanol  detection  in  alcoholic  beverages/sanitizers  (chapter 
5.3.2) and  carcinogenic formaldehyde sensing  in indoor  air (chapter 
5.3.3)  while  others  are  in  clinical  testing  as  with  non-invasive  fat 
metabolism  monitoring  enabled  through  flame-made  catalytic  filters 
that work even at room temperature [137]. Furthermore, quite prom-
ising is the development of such devices for sniffing entrapped humans 
(chapter  5.1),  activity  tracking  (through  breath  isoprene)  and  even 
toxic benzene detection [292]. These developments highlight how ma-
terial design by combustion science can impact critical applications for 
gas  sensing.  One  is  limited  only  by  imagination  what  soon  may  be 
possible,  for  instance,  sniffing  robots  or  drones,  smart  apartment-
s/houses/cities  with  continuous  air  quality  management  to  protect 
populations from hazardous compounds or non-invasive and affordable 
medical screening for disease diagnostics even at an early stage. 

There  is  little  doubt  that  chemical  sensing  is  a  key  technology  to 
address  some  of  the  most  pressing  global  challenges  humankind 
currently faces. At the same time, it is surprising that still gas sensors are 
mostly absent in daily life as even the most recent smartphones typically 
contain no chemical sensors! This, however, offers distinct opportunities 
for  combustion  scientists  and  engineers  in  close  interaction  with  end 
users (physicians, officers, etc.) but also entrepreneurs and lawyers to 

translate innovations into products that society can ultimately benefit 
from. Not without reason, artificial olfaction with sensors has been listed 
′′
among the “seven technologies to watch in 2021

in Nature [293].

Dr. Andreas Güntner is a research team leader at the Univ. 
Hospital  Zürich  (Dept.  Endocrinology,  Diabetology  and  Clin-
ical Nutrition) and a lecturer at ETH Zürich (Dept. Mechanical 
& Process Engineering). His research aims to advance the un-
derstanding and application of micro & nanoscaled materials at 
the  interface  between  physics,  chemistry  and  medicine.  The 
development  of new sensing technologies for healthcare and 
environmental purposes is a particular emphasis. His research 
has  been  recognized  by an ERC  Starting  Grant, twice by  the 
ETH Medal for outstanding M.Sc. and Ph.D. theses, the Excel-
lence Award for Product Design and Engineering from the Euro-
pean Federation of Chemical Engineering and the Gesellschaft 
für Aerosolforschung (GAeF) PhD Award by the Association for 
Aerosol Research, among other recognitions. He has published 
30+ refereed articles and filed four patents.  

Nicolay J. Pineau received his B.Sc. (2014) and M.Sc. (2017) in 
mechanical  engineering  from  the  Swiss  Federal  Institute  of 
Technology (ETH Zurich). Currently, he is a PhD candidate at 
the  Particle  Technology  Laboratory  in  the  Mechanical  and 
Process Engineering Department at ETH Zurich. In his research, 
he tailors flame-made gas sensing materials to meet stringent 
sensitivity and selectivity requirements. For this, he received 
the best poster award for Synthesis  and Structuring of Func-
tional  Nanoparticles  during  the  2017  Annual  Meeting  of  the 
European Aerosol Conference in Zurich, Switzerland. Today he 
focuses on combining the sensing materials to orthogonal arrays 
for  highly  selective  sensing  of  trace  gasses  and  vapors  in 
complex mixtures for industrial, environmental and biomedical 
applications.  

Professor Sotiris E. Pratsinis (www.ptl.ethz.ch) teaches Mass 
Transfer and Micro-Nano-Particle Technology at ETH Zurich,

tions in industry and academia across the globe while currently 
he advises two PhDs and six post-docs. He has published 400+
refereed articles, filed 20+ patents that are licensed to industry 
and  have  contributed  to  the  creation  of  four  spinoffs.  His- 
research  on  multiscale  particle  dynamics  facilitated  flame 
aerosol  synthesis  of  nanostructured  materials  with  closely 
controlled  characteristics.  This  scalable  process  is  practiced 
today in industrial units and academic laboratories worldwide. 
He  and  his  students  developed  innovative  algorithms  for 
agglomerate  formation  and  growth  by  2-dimensional  (mass 
and surface area) population balances. These along with their proof of the rapid and nearly 
simultaneous attainment of both self-preserving size distribution and fractal-like structure 
during  aerosol  synthesis  of  materials  enabled  him  to  create  simple  particle  dynamics 
models that are interfaced readily with fluid mechanics greatly facilitating process design 
for  particle  manufacture  and  processing.  This  contributed  decisively  to  identifying  the 
origins of nanosilver toxicity, led to novel heterogeneous catalysts and, for the first time, 
flame-made  dental  and  theranostic  materials,  nutritional  supplements,  gas  sensors  and 
even to the assembly of such devices.
