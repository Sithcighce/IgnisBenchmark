A class of non-detonating materials capable of highly exothermic reactions, referred to as reactive
materials (RMs), has been subjected to extensive recent studies. Examples include pure reactive metals,
intermetallic, metal-metalloid composites, and thermites; the latter two types of materials include nano-
composite and nanostructured compositions. Most of the studied RMs are based on aluminum. Potential
applications for RMs include additives to conventional energetics (propellants, explosives, and pyro-
technics) and reactive structural components. Design of energetic systems including RM's requires
reliable prediction of their ignition kinetics, including ignition delays as a function of involved heating
rates, pressures, and oxidizing environments. Direct measurements of such ignition delays are often
impossible because of hostile surroundings RMs are exposed to. Research has been active in quantifying
ignition temperatures and kinetics using simplified configurations and low heating rates, relatively easily
achieved in laboratory conditions. Alternatively, multiple ignition studies focused on a specific stimuli,
e.g., electric current, spark, heat pulse, etc. However, correlation between laboratory studies and ignition
observed in practical situation is tentative at best. Substantial discrepancies exist between different
experiments and, respectively, proposed ignition models. More recently, thermo-analytical (TA) mea-
surements performed isothermally or at well-controlled heating rates and in well-characterized envi-
ronments were used to identify and describe quantitatively reactions leading to ignition. In this review,
TA measurements aimed to develop models for ignition of pure aluminum, aluminum-based reactive
intermetallics, and thermites are considered using specific examples for each type of material. The focus
is on relatively recent studies. Results and interpretations of the TA measurements are discussed in terms
of their relevance to describing ignition for each specific type of material. The examples included are
selected because substantial progress in characterization of their ignition mechanisms was made
recently using TA measurements. Individual exothermic steps were identified and assigned to particular
reactions or phase transformations in each specific material system. Kinetics of some of the identified
steps were reported and applicability of such kinetics is discussed for modeling ignition, involving much
higher heating rates than thermo-analytical measurements. Different ignition stimuli are considered, and
ignition models involving detailed analysis of heat transfer affected by identified chemical reactions are
discussed briefly. Both benefits and limitations of applying the TA based reaction mechanisms for
ignition models are considered. Some common caveats in interpreting TA measurements for reactive
materials are also reviewed. Despite substantial progress, there are no comprehensive and universally
accepted ignition models for the materials systems. A common theme observed here for all reactive
materials is that ignition is caused by more than one reaction and/or phase change. Many, but not all such
reactions and phase changes can be characterized based on thermo-analytical measurements.

1. Introduction

Equipment for thermoanalytical (TA) measurements and rele-
vant methods of data processing to recover reaction kinetics
developed rapidly starting from the middle of the 20th century
making thermal analysis today one of the most common and
widely used laboratory techniques. Not surprisingly, combustion
researchers have exploited TA measurements to characterize both
stability and ignition of many heterogeneously reacting materials,
e.g. [1e6], (many more examples are available in the literature).
However, despite the precision and high level of automation for
state of the art TA equipment, the interpretation of results may be
difficult when the goal is to characterize ignition.

Ignition is commonly described by classic Semenov or Frank-
eKamenetskii models [7,8]. Both models assume a single Arrhenius
type exothermic reaction and neglect the reaction progress function,
describing how evolution of the reacting system affects the reaction
rate. They also assume that the transport of reagents is fast compared
to their consumption in the reaction. It is a good assumption for slow,
kinetically controlled gas-phase reactions; however, it is not sus-
tained for most heterogeneous combustion reactions, even for
“simple” systems comprising pure metal particles, when condensed
phase diffusion may determine the reaction rate. It has been recog-
nized long ago that for many condensed fuels, the ignition models
need to be altered by accounting for consumption of reactants, e.g.,
by introducing a basic reaction progress function, e.g., [9].

The situation involving ignition of reactive materials may be
somewhat more complex. Even if consumption of reactants prior to
ignition is negligible, low-temperature, slow pre-ignition reactions
may affect significantly material properties controlling diffusion of
reacting species. For example a protective oxide layer may become
thicker, introducing an additional diffusion barrier. Initial compo-
nents might produce new compounds and/or structures, especially
in the vicinity of the reaction interface, altering the reaction
mechanism. Phase changes, such as melting of material near the
reaction interface, change transport processes in the reacting sys-
tems dramatically. Such processes may occur when only a very
small amount of reactants was consumed, but they can have pro-
nounced effect on further reactions. Thus, such processes must be
accounted for in the ignition model.

A useful model must describe self-heating leading to combus-
tion. It should also describe how the temperature ramp affected the
material and, especially, the reaction interface, even if consumption

of reactants was relatively small. Often,
there are multiple
exothermic reaction steps, which become important at different
stages of reaction progress, and neglecting this may critically bias
ignition models for reactive materials.

TA measurements enable one to identify and characterize
quantitatively the effect of material evolution on its reaction rate.
Advantages of such measurements, which are often combined with
product analysis, include their capability to distinguish multiple
individual reaction steps, assign specific reactions and/or phase
changes to the measured heat effects or mass changes, and quantify
kinetics of the identified reactions.

There are, however,

important limitations. The rates of TA
measurements are necessarily much lower than the heating rates
occurring in most practical situations involving ignition of reactive
materials. Therefore, translating any processes detected in TA to a
practical situation requires a well-justified kinetic model. For
example, if aluminum nano-powder begins oxidizing at ~720 K
when heated at 5e20 K/min in thermo-gravimetric (TG) experi-
ments [10], oxidation of aluminum nanoparticles in a propellant or
explosive, where it is heated much faster, is likely to begin at a
higher temperature.
In addition to using kinetic calculations,
translating the reactions observed in TA experiments to practical
scenarios assumes that no other process, undetectable in TA
experiments, would occur. It is also assumed that the reactions
observed in TA experiments remain fundamentally unchanged at
higher heating rates, which may not necessarily be the case. For
example, some reactions occurring at low heating rates may require
an intermediate product generated in preceding reaction steps. At
higher heating rate, such reaction steps may be abbreviated, so that
no intermediate product required for subsequent reaction steps is
produced. As a rule, these latter assumptions are difficult to
validate.

To be useful, TA measurements should be well designed. Typi-
cally, such measurements include differential thermal analysis
(DTA), DSC, and TG analysis [11]. Simultaneous DTA and TG or DSC
and TG are often used. Commonly for all TA methods, the sample
temperature is controlled and a characteristic parameter quanti-
fying the sample reaction at a given temperature is measured.
Methods of temperature control and the actual accuracy with
which the sample temperature is defined vary depending on the
type of the instrument. In a power compensated DSC, the sample
temperature is strictly controlled, while in a heat flow DSC or DTA, a
small temperature difference between sample and reference is

used to generate the heat flow signal. In either case, in a well-
designed experiment the deviation of the sample temperature
from the temperature prescribed by the heating program should be
minimized. The principle of controlled sample temperature
remains the same for all TA measurements. Contemporary
instruments cover temperatures from below room temperature to
ca. 1700e1800 K, although different instruments may need to be
used for low- and high-temperature measurements. The range of
temperatures from 300 to 1400 K is covered by many devices. In
both DTA and DSC, heat flow from a reacting sample is quantified.
In TG, sample mass is tracked. Most commonly, all measurements
are performed at different fixed heating rates. Isothermal mea-
surements are also used when possible. With modern equipment,
non-linear and modulated heating rates can be used. The heating
program can be controlled such that the observed reaction rate
(heat flow or mass change) is kept constant, or within defined
limits. It is common practice to heat the sample at 3e5 different
effective (constant or varied) rates, enabling one to recover reaction
kinetics via isoconversion analysis [12].

Thermal analysis is not designed for and should not be used to
directly observe ignition. Thermo-analytical measurements are
based on the precise control of the sample temperature. The whole
sample is assumed to be at the recorded temperature. In contrast,
during ignition, the temperature increases independent of any
external control, and temperature gradients in the sample are
inevitable. Thus, TA results where ignition did occur cannot be
properly interpreted. When the sample ignites in TA experiments,
e.g. [13,14], the measurements must be repeated using a lower
heating rate, a smaller sample mass, or a sample geometry (e.g.
pellet vs. powder) with better heat flow characteristics. Ignition
should always be avoided in TA measurements.

TA measurements are often supplemented by evolved gas
analysis, specifically Mass Spectroscopy (MS), Fourier Transform
Infra-Red (FTIR) Spectroscopy, or other in-situ analytical techniques
capable of identifying volatile species produced by samples heated
to different temperatures. Further, analysis of the fully and partially
heated and cooled material samples using x-ray diffraction (XRD)
or scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is quite common and useful.
New TA measurements and techniques develop rapidly, taking
advantage of new technologies, including electro-thermal analysis
[15,16] and semiconductor nanocalorimeters [17e22], which can
be combined with in-situ x-ray diffraction using synchrotron
radiation [23,24] and Dynamic Transmission Electron Microscope
(DTEM) [25,26].

In this paper, applications of TA measurements and their
interpretations to characterize ignition are illustrated for several
aluminum-based systems. Aluminum is the most widely used
metal additive to propellants, explosives, and pyrotechnics.
Respectively, its ignition kinetics in different reactive materials are
of substantial interest. First, ignition for pure aluminum powders is
reviewed. Ignition in intermetallic systems is considered based on
the example of NieAl, probably the most studied exothermic
intermetallic reaction. Finally, ignition in several aluminum-based
thermite systems is discussed.

2. Oxidation reaction leading to ignition of aluminum

2.1. Thermoanalytical data for aluminum oxidation in oxygen

Oxidation of aluminum in oxygen is one of the most widely
studied metal oxidation reactions. In this review, the focus is on
oxidation of aluminum powders investigated by TA methods and
on interpretation of the TA measurements to predict aluminum
ignition. First detailed TA measurements of aluminum oxidation
were prompted by development of nano-aluminum powders
[27e30]. Some of the early interpretations mentioned qualitative
differences between regular micron-sized and nano-powders [29];
however, further work showed that the differences are readily
explained by different surface areas available for oxidation for
powders with different particle sizes. A detailed TG study of
oxidation of a wide range of aluminum powders is presented in
Ref. [31]. Different oxidation steps were observed, as supported by
more recent TA studies, e.g., [32e34]; the results were interpreted
using an empirical model. Further, in Refs. [35], it was suggested
that the growing alumina film undergoes polymorphic phase
changes; however, no quantitative correlation between the phase
change kinetics and oxidation behavior was offered. Polymorphic
phase changes in the growing aluminum oxide layer were directly
correlated with the observed stepwise oxidation behavior of
micron-sized aluminum powders in Refs. [36,37]. This approach
was extended for nanopowders in Ref. [38]. This correlation was
further developed into a detailed model [39], aimed to describe
thermally initiated ignition of aluminum. The model was further
refined in Ref. [40] using TG experiments with a wider range of
heating rates.

A TG curve showing oxidation steps for aluminum powders is
shown in Fig. 1 [39]. The curve is broken down into 4 stages; for
each stage a cartoon schematically illustrating the respective

rate-controlling process is shown. The sequence of phase changes
accompanying oxidative growth of alumina layer is consistent with
that extensively established in the literature [41]. Different alumina
polymorphs, except for amorphous, are detectable using X-ray
diffraction of partially oxidized powders. During stage I, natural
amorphous aluminum oxide is growing. A polymorphic amorphous
to g-Al2O3 transition is caused by elevated temperatures and
increased oxide thickness. This transition is accompanied by a
marked increase in the density of Al2O3, from 3 g/cm3 (ambient) for
amorphous alumina to 3.67 g/cm3 (ambient) for g-Al2O3 [41].
Because of the relatively small overall oxide thickness, comparable
to the dimension of the forming face-centered cubic (fcc) g-Al2O3
crystals, the newly formed g-Al2O3 crystallites produce a mono-
layer that may not form the same continuous protective film as that
of the natural amorphous alumina. Thus, the phase change causes
substantial acceleration of the mass transfer through the oxide
layer and, respectively, accelerated oxidation in stage II. The poly-
crystalline g-Al2O3 layer continues to grow by oxidation during
stage III. It may transfer to other transition aluminas with similar
fcc crystal structures and densities, such as q-Al2O3, which has little
effect on the oxidation rate. A phase change to a much denser
(3.99 g/cm3, ambient), hexagonal close packed a-Al2O3 polymorph
[41] occurs by the end of stage III, at substantially higher temper-
atures. In TG experiments, at this point the oxide layer is thicker
than the characteristic dimension of the forming a-Al2O3 crystal-
lites. Therefore, when a-Al2O3 forms, the alumina layer consists of
several layers of crystallites with a greater density and reduced
diffusivity compared to the previously existing layers of g or
q-Al2O3. Thus, the oxidation rate drops. As the temperature con-
tinues to increase, the oxidation continues during stage IV, when a-
Al2O3 continues to grow.

In order to characterize the kinetics of different oxidation steps,
TG measurements were repeated at multiple heating rates as
shown in Fig. 2 [40]. As expected for the thermally activated pro-
cesses, TG traces shift to higher temperatures at increased heating
rates.

2.2. Reaction kinetics for aluminum oxidation derived from TA
measurements

The processes illustrated in Fig. 1 are described quantitatively
considering oxidation of spherical aluminum particles. Each parti-
cle is covered by an alumina layer, which may include up to three
sublayers, representing different polymorphs: amorphous, g, and
a-Al2O3. The model assumes that the oxidation occurs as a

sequence of individual thermally activated diffusion processes. For
each individual process the reaction rate is controlled by diffusion
through one alumina polymorph, for which it is the slowest. For
each polymorph (subscript i 1⁄4 amorphous, g, and a-Al2O3), the
instantaneous rate of oxidation expressed through the mass
increase dm/dt, is described as:

ðdm=dtÞ

where T is temperature, C*
i is the combined oxidation constant; ri(cid:2)1
and ri are the inner and outer radii of the growing alumina sublayer,
respectively; Ei is the activation energy; and R is the universal gas
constant. Although three terms for each type of alumina can be
calculated at any given time, to simplify the model only one term at
a time is considered active, representing the sublayer with the
greatest diffusion resistance. Diffusion resistance is defined as
RD 1⁄4 h/DA, where h is the thickness of the oxide layer, A is the area
of the reaction interface, and D is diffusion coefficient. The greatest
diffusion resistance corresponds to the lowest rate of diffusion for a
specific oxide sublayer.

Polymorphic phase changes are described by introducing an
interface between the parent and newly formed polymorphs
(subscripts j and k, respectively) moving across the oxide layer in
radial direction, consuming the parent oxide, and leaving the
product behind. Following Refs. [39,40], the interface is formed
outside of the parent oxide layer and is moving inward. The rate of
phase change defining the velocity of the moving interface, vj/k, is
treated as a characteristic of a thermally activated process with its
own activation energy and pre-exponent. It is also assumed that the
stability of the parent polymorph decreases with increasing layer
thickness. Thus, the pre-exponent describing the interface velocity
is a function of both, temperature and parent oxide thickness:

where h is the layer thickness, and F and K are empirically deter-

The model

includes additional details describing oxidation
when the thickness of a newly formed alumina sublayer is smaller
than or comparable to the size of its individual crystallites. In
particular, this situation is encountered when amorphous oxide
transforms to g-Al2O3, when the entire thickness of the oxide is in
the range of 3e5 nm. Diffusion resistance of the newly formed,
discontinuous monolayer of g-Al2O3 crystallites is considered to be
much lower than that attributable to a regular polycrystalline layer
of g-alumina. An empirical formula is introduced that adjusts lin-
early the diffusion resistance of the newly formed sublayer as its
thickness is increasing from a negligible initial value to that char-
acterizing a layer of regular g-Al2O3 [39]. The final thickness used in
this adjustment, hi,max, is determined as a function of the heating
rate according to an equation

The empirical coefficients hi,min, Gi and Li are determined from
the relation of the layer thickness vs. heating rate at the beginning
of the region where only polymorph i exists. Until hi,max is reached,
the pre-exponent describing the diffusive growth of i-polymorph is
modeled as a linear function of its thickness, hi:

where the constant c accounts for the differences in molar weight
and in density between the metal core and the oxide shell. It is
important to account for the effect of temperature on density of
both aluminum core and alumina shell; it is particularly important
to consider differences in densities for different alumina poly-
morphs [41]. However, possible cracks in the oxide shell due to
mismatch between thermal expansion coefficients between
aluminum and alumina are discounted. Such cracks may not be
forming for thin oxide shells, as analyses of mechanical properties
of such shells suggest [42]. It was shown that strain effects appear
only when the thickness exceeds 20 nm, a situation that can occur
in low heating rate TA experiments, but highly improbable in
ignition scenarios. Thinner alumina shells are ductile and do not
exert pressure on aluminum cores thermally expanding upon their
heating. The same conclusion was made in a detailed study [43],
employing high-temperature X-ray diffraction analysis, hot-stage
transmission electron microscopy, and high-resolution trans-
mission electron microscopy to probe the thermal behaviors of
aluminum and alumina lattices before and after melting of the
aluminum core.

The right hand side of Eq. (5) (labeled “Y(TGA)”) as a function of
inverse temperature gives a plot, which should appear as a straight

line with a positive slope for each portion of reaction, which is
defined by a single activation energy, according to Eq. (1). An
example of such a plot is shown in Fig. 3.

Activation energies (slopes) and pre-exponents (intercepts) for
different oxidation steps can be identified from Fig. 3. Comparing
results for different heating rates, additional empirical constants
characterizing phase transitions can also be determined.

Other methods of data processing are also useful. For example,
model-free isoconversion method following Ref. [44] was applied
to aluminum oxidation data in Ref. [40]; resulting activation energy
as a function of the reaction progress is shown in Fig. 4. Results
presented in Fig. 4 are consistent with recent global oxidation ki-
netics measurements for aluminum powders [45].

Based on multiple TG measurements and data processing
illustrated in Figs. 3 and 4, parameters of aluminum oxidation
necessary to complete the system of Eqs. (1)e(4) were determined
and are shown in Table 1. Using these parameters and Eqs. (1)e(4),
oxidation of aluminum powders can be described for any heating
rate, including those encountered in different practical situations.
Combining Eqs. (1)e(4) with appropriate descriptions of heat and
mass transfer in the gas phase yields a comprehensive model
capable of describing ignition of aluminum particles assuming, of

course, that the oxidation sequence observed in the TA measure-
ments remains the same at high heating rates. The biggest
experimental uncertainty remains for the reaction kinetics char-
acterizing the earliest stages of oxidation (regions showing direct
growth of amorphous oxide in Fig. 3 and degree of oxidation less
than 5% in Fig. 4), where the accuracy of TA measurements is
lowest.

Uncertainty in kinetic parameters in general should be dis-
cussed. There are several sources of uncertainty, specific to each
method of determining kinetic parameters. Consider the process-
ing illustrated in Fig. 3, where straight lines are fit to segments of
the experimental data. The fitting will give a nominal uncertainty
for both, slope and intersect of the straight lines. Similarly, iso-
conversion analysis, as illustrated in Fig. 4, yields nominal error
bars on the derived activation energy. However, by far the greatest
source of uncertainty is rooted in the strong correlation between
activation energy and pre-exponent. This is a hard problem when
using a single curve method, as in Fig. 3 (see discussion of
compensation effect in Ref. [12]). For kinetic parameters derived
from data with multiple heating rates, e.g. isoconversion analysis,
uncertainties become smaller when more heating rates are being
used, and when the difference between smallest and highest
heating rate is greater. The values shown in Table 1 were deter-
mined by a combination of methods, and rigorous uncertainties
were not determined. However, the activation energies are esti-
mated to be accurate to within 10% of their respective values.

2.3. Location of the reaction interface for oxidizing aluminum
powders

As the above oxidation model was developed, assumptions were
made regarding the location of the reaction, i.e. the reactive inter-
face, or the location where new oxide forms. The available literature
suggested that oxidation of flat, bare crystalline aluminum surfaces
producing an amorphous oxide layer is controlled by outward
aluminum diffusion. Consequently the reaction occurs at the oxide-
gaseous oxidizer interface [46]. Conversely, inward diffusion of

oxygen was suggested to control the reaction rate when amorphous
[47] and crystalline g-alumina polymorphs are forming [46,48]. In
more recent studies of oxidation of nano-sized aluminum particles,
it was suggested that the slow oxidation at temperatures below the
aluminum melting point is dominated by the inward diffusion of
oxygen, whereas the formation of hollow nanoparticles above
melting point indicates the significance of outward diffusion of
aluminum ions [49]. The molecular dynamics simulation efforts
[50,51] investigating nano-aluminum particles heated at a very
high rate suggest that outward diffusion of aluminum controls the
reaction rate in a broad range of temperatures, including temper-
atures well above those expected for the amorphous to g-alumina
phase change. Thus, an experimental validation is necessary for any
assumption regarding the location of the reactive interface for
aluminum oxidation models.

The above assumption has implications for the geometry of the
oxidizing particle, and on geometric constraints of the oxidation
rate. For spherical particles, the reactive interface can either in-
crease or shrink as the reaction progresses depending on its loca-
tion, as illustrated in Fig. 5. This effect can either accelerate or slow
down the reaction. The effect is particularly strong for fine, nano-
scale particles where there is a stronger difference between inner
and outer surface areas of the oxide layer.

It was also assumed that the core/shell geometry remains intact,
and that there always is a metal-oxide interface. These assumptions
were a useful approximation for the treatment of polydisperse
powders, especially during the early and arguably the most rele-
vant stages of oxidation. Once again, an experimental validation
was necessary to support the model.

It was recently shown that TA measurements with polydisperse
powders can be used to locate the reaction interface experimentally
and track its evolution during aluminum oxidation [52]. This same
approach was tested and validated for reactions of aluminum
powder with steam and liquid water [53]. It is necessary to use at
least two spherical powders with different, but overlapping particle
size distributions. In Ref. [52], aluminum powders with nominal
particle dimensions of 3e4.5 and 10e14 mm were used. The nom-
inal particle dimensions were specified by the manufacturer and
did not represent the entire particle size ranges for each powder. As
explained below, detailed measurements of the actual particle size
distributions were necessary for appropriate interpretation of the
TA measurements.

Mass gains recorded in TG measurements during oxidation of
the two powders in oxygen are shown in Fig. 6. Particle size dis-
tributions for each powder were measured and traces shown in
Fig. 6 were processed to determine respective mass gain for each
particle size bin. Different distributions of the measured mass gain

among the particle size bins were considered with the total number
of particles representing the entire powder sample used in the TG
experiment. For each distribution, the location of the reactive
interface was assumed to be according to one of the oxidation
configurations shown in Fig. 5. In Fig. 7, mass gains and oxide
thickness obtained for particles in five selected for example size
bins are shown for 3e4.5 mm powder. Differences in the predicted
mass and, especially, oxide thickness are significant between
different oxidation scenarios. Selected size bins represent a subset
of particle sizes present in both powders used in measurements.
Assuming that the oxidation of particles in a given size bin does not
depend on the behavior of the rest of the powder, it is possible to
compare to each other the mass gain and oxide thickness evolution
for the size bins present in both powders. If the model used to
calculate respective mass gains and oxide thicknesses for this size
bin for both powders represents the true oxidation scenario, the
results for both powders will coincide. Conversely, if the model is
incorrect, it should be observed that the same size particles change
their mass and oxide thickness differently during the same heating
program applied for different powders.

Comparisons of mass gains predicted for particles from a 4.7 mm
diameter size bin oxidizing in different aluminum powders ac-
cording to different reaction scenarios are shown in Fig. 8. It is clear
that the case a (Fig. 5) results in a substantial discrepancy between
mass gains predicted for the two powders. The discrepancies are
substantially smaller for cases b and c. In Ref. [52], the quadratic
mean error is used to quantify such discrepancies for all particle
size bins common for both powders. The discrepancy is greatest for
case (a), it exceeds cases (b) and (c) by more than a factor of two.
Cases (b) and (c) are comparable with a slight preference for case (c)
(see Fig. 9 in Ref. [52]). If case (c) most accurately describes the
oxidation mechanism, hollow oxide shells containing partially
consumed aluminum should result from the reaction. To verify this,
samples of aluminum powders were heated to specific tempera-
tures and recovered for SEM analysis. In initial tests, observations
showed broken oxide shells, that did not retain their spherical
symmetry. The shells did contain unoxidized aluminum, as
expected. Interestingly, similar TG measurements and inspection of
partially reacted aluminum powders were reported in Ref. [32].
Authors of Ref. [32] proposed that the broken oxide shells con-
taining aluminum melt form as a result of an internal stress exerted
by molten aluminum. However, if the oxide shell is partially empty,
as expected from Fig. 5c, no such stresses should be produced. In
order to minimize any possible damage to the sample during its
handling, powder monolayers were heated in Ref. [52] on alumina
plates using the same TG program as in other experiments. The
plates with the heated (and cooled) powder were later transferred
to SEM without handling the powder directly. SEM images of such
undisturbed samples are shown in Fig. 9. There are no broken oxide
shells, and particles remain spherical, confirming that the shells
were broken due to the sample handling in Refs. [32,52] rather than
during TG experiments.

It is interesting that the particles quenched from the lowest
temperature, 750 (cid:4)C (Fig. 9a) exhibit surface depressions, which are
no longer present for particles quenched from higher temperatures.
The depressions were formed when a very thin, soft, and partially
hollow oxide shell cooled off. At greater oxide thicknesses attained
at higher temperatures, the shells became rigid and did not cave in,
leaving the partially hollow particles spherical. At higher temper-
atures, alumina crystals grow on the outside of the shells, further

supporting the reaction mechanism involving outward diffusion of
aluminum. The reaction mechanism described by Fig. 5c is
consistent with recent measurements [45] showing formation of
hollow oxide shells upon oxidation of aluminum powders obtained
by processing experimental TG curves considering different
oxidation scenarios [52].

As a consequence of the oxidation on the outside of the particle
and the rigidity of the oxide shell, there is competition between

volume decrease of the core e increase in void volume e due to
consumption, and core volume increase e decrease in void volume
e due to thermal expansion and melting. Further, since thermal
expansion and volume expansion on aluminum melting occur on
the time scale of heat transfer while the core consumption occurs
on the time scale of the oxidation reaction, whether there is a void,
and at what temperatures it exists, depends on the heating rate.
Similarly, because the oxidation rate depends on the reactive

surface area, while thermal expansion effects are volumetric in
nature, the occurrence of a void depends on the particle size.

Fig. 10 shows examples of calculated core, inner oxide, and outer
oxide radii for particles with increasing sizes, heated at increasing
rates, illustrating three main scenarios possible for the oxidizing
particles. Calculations are performed at increasing heating rates
while taking oxidation reaction, thermal expansion, and volume
expansion on melting into account. For the smaller particle
(diameter 1.26 mm) heated at 5 K/min shown in Fig. 10 consumption
of the aluminum metal is rapid enough and therefore the void
volume is large enough so that any expansion of the core will never
close the void volume until the aluminum core is completely
consumed near 1155 K. As a consequence, the oxide shell of this
particle heated at this rate will never experience tensile stress.
Conversely, the aluminum consumption in the larger particle
(diameter 7.42 mm) heated at 100 K/min shown in Fig. 10 is rela-
tively slow so that a void that started to form at 900 K is completely
closed by the volume expansion at the aluminum melting tem-
perature. The shell of this particle, heated at this specific heating
rate experiences significant tensile stress, and may be expected to
be disrupted, exposing fresh aluminum surface to the oxidizer.
Further, for this example, a void develops multiple times: below Al
melting, above Al melting, and finally above about 1100 K. For a still
larger particle (diameter 30.07 mm), heated at a 200 K/min the void
only develops well after aluminum melting point, so that the shell

is continuously stressed until it separates from the core. Generally,
starting at small particle sizes, and low heating rates, the three
scenarios shown in Fig. 10 are encountered as either, or both, the
size and the heating rate increases. The examples in Fig. 10 were
chosen because the discussed effects are well visible.

The different possible scenarios are summarized in Fig. 11,
where the occurrence of a void, and therefore the potential tensile
stress on the oxide layer is mapped as a function of particle size
and heating rate. At heating rates in the range of thermal analysis
(10 K/min) and below, the presence or absence of a void in oxidizing
spherical aluminum particles is primarily determined by particle
size, and the influence of heating rate is negligible. Particles below
about 3 mm in diameter always oxidize more quickly than they
thermally expand, and therefore the oxide shell never experiences
tensile stress. Particles above about 30 mm diameter develop a void
only above the Al melting point, always exposing the oxide shell to
mechanical stress due to thermal expansion and the volume change
on melting. Particles between about 3 and 30 mm develop a void
below the melting point that is smaller than the volume change on
Al melting, and therefore the oxide shell will also experience some
stress as aluminum melts. As the heating rate increases, the
boundary between void/no stress, and no void/stress shifts to
smaller particle sizes.

2.4. Effect of oxidizing environment: aluminum oxidation in gases
containing CO2 and H2O

While the systematic characterization of aluminum oxidation in
air and/or oxygen provides a valuable basis for model development,
the oxidizers in practical propulsion applications and other ener-
getic systems frequently include hydrocarbon combustion prod-
ucts. Major components in such environments are carbon dioxide

and water. Thermal analysis of aluminum oxidation in CO2 and H2O,
and in their mixtures with oxygen, is therefore needed to test the
model that was developed for oxidation in O2, and to modify it, if
necessary.

Reference [54] describes aluminum oxidation in CO2, Ref. [55]
describes oxidation in H2O, and Ref. [56] combines CO2 and H2O
as oxidizers. The resulting behavior cannot be derived from a
simple combination of oxidizers. Modeling the oxidizer effect
cannot be reduced to an effective net oxygen concentration in the
atmosphere, as is rather common practice. Instead, interactions of
the growing alumina surface layer with different species present in
the environment dramatically change structure, composition, and
transport properties of the oxide layer produced in mixed envi-
ronments. The location of the reaction interface is also affected
because of these structural and compositional changes. The loca-
tion of the reaction interface can also shift because different species
(aluminum diffusing outward or oxidizer molecules diffusing
inward) may diffuse faster through the growing alumina in
different environments.

2.4.1. CO2/O2/Ar

Oxidation of micron-sized aluminum powder in CO2 and CO2/O2
mixed oxidizers occurs in several stages, similar to that in oxygen.
Fig. 12 shows a representative set of TG measurements in different
environments containing CO2. As in O2 (see Figs. 1 and 2), stages can
be identified corresponding to growth of, or transition between the
different polymorphs of alumina. Details differ in degrees: at higher
temperatures the growth of transition alumina polymorphs (g and
q) in CO2 is slower than in O2. The thermal stability of the transition
alumina polymorphs, primarily for q-Al2O3 is extended to higher
temperatures in the presence of CO2 so that the denser a-Al2O3
polymorph forms later than in oxygen. Because of the lower
diffusivity of transition alumina polymorphs as compared to
a-Al2O3, for the samples heated to the same temperatures, a higher
degree of oxidation is achieved in CO2 as compared to the envi-
ronments containing O2 as the only oxidizer. In mixed CO2/O2
oxidizers, the initial growth of g-Al2O3 proceeds as fast as with
oxygen only, while the region of stability of transition alumina
polymorphs remains extended to higher temperatures.

Activation energies were determined from measurements at
different heating rates, and a combination of single-curve pro-
cessing as illustrated in Fig. 3, and isoconversion analysis (analo-
gous to Fig. 4). Summary results are shown in Table 2. Given the

Eg: 259 kJ/mol
Ea: 202 kJ/mol
Eam/g: 562 kJ/mol
Eg/a: 592 kJ/mol

large uncertainties, the values are consistent with the values
obtained in O2 shown in Table 1.

2.4.2. H2O/O2/Ar

Contrary to oxidation in CO2, the observed oxidation behavior in
the presence of steam differs markedly from oxidation in dry
oxygen. Fig. 13 shows a set of representative curves at different
H2O/O2 ratios. Oxidation in steam is complete near 1000 (cid:4)C vs.
1300 (cid:4)C in dry CO2, and 1500 (cid:4)C in dry oxygen. In addition, a distinct
stepwise weight change is observed at the melting point of
aluminum, while this step is difficult to observe in either dry
oxygen or CO2.

The complete oxidation observed at a lower temperature in
steam as compared to dry oxygen or CO2 can be explained by the
stabilization of the g polymorph of the surface oxide in the pres-
ence of water so that a denser and slower growing a-alumina does
not form until higher temperatures. Experiments in mixed oxygen/
steam oxidizers [55] showed that the size of the oxidation step
observed upon aluminum melting correlates with the concentra-
tion of steam in the atmosphere and is unaffected by concentration
of oxygen. This was interpreted as the effect of transient porosity,
the degree of which is controlled by the steam concentration.
Alternatively the surface oxide stressed by the expanding melting
metal core may behave as a semipermeable membrane where
hydrous species have significantly higher diffusion rates than
oxygen e a clear distinction could not be drawn.

However, a recent study evaluating the location of the reactive
interface [53] following the same method as outlined above (see
Figs. 11e14 and related discussion) suggests an alternative expla-
nation. As opposed to the oxidation in dry oxygen or air, new oxide
growth in both steam and in liquid water occurs at the alumi-
numeoxide interface. A void does not develop. This means that in

the presence of water in the atmosphere new alumina is continu-
ously added at the innermost portion of the growing alumina layer.
Consequently there is compressive stress on the aluminumeoxide
interface, and at the same time tensile stress on the outer oxide-
atmosphere interface. Therefore the oxide layer in the presence of
water will become porous primarily due to geometric constraints:
new oxide growth, thermal expansion, and the volume expansion
on aluminum melting all subject the oxide layer to tensile stress.
This is in clear contrast to oxidation in dry environments, where
oxide grows on the outside of the particle, and thermal expansion e
and melting volume change e are partially compensated by the
formation of a void between the aluminum core and the oxide shell.
As a result, oxidation in the presence of water in the environment
proceeds faster, and is complete at lower temperatures than in dry
oxidizers.

Due to these geometric aspects, and because the details of the
developing porosity of the oxide layer have not yet been fully
described, only model-free isoconversion analysis of the kinetics
was feasible. Below the melting temperature, in the temperature
interval where amorphous oxide grows, and transitions to the g
polymorph, the activation energy was observed to increase from
about 50 kJ/mol to about 200 kJ mol. This was consistent with the
previous observations (Tables 2 and 3). Above the melting of Al, the
activation energy starts at about 200 kJ/mol (at 20% oxidation), and
linearly increases to about 320 kJ/mol (at 80% oxidation) without
showing any clear transition.

O2, CO2 and H2O should be combined. In an exploratory study [56],
oxidation of spherical aluminum powder was investigated by
thermogravimetric analysis in oxygen, CO2, steam, and mixtures of
these oxidizers. Heating rates ranged between 2 and 20 K/min, and
the maximum temperatures were 1370 and 1770 K in atmospheres
containing steam and in dry atmospheres, respectively. Represen-
tative results are shown in Fig. 14. Oxidation up to the Al melting
point is comparable between oxidizers. At higher temperatures the
oxidation behavior is qualitatively more similar to oxidation in
steam (see Fig. 13) than to oxidation in CO2 (Fig. 12): an oxidation
step is observed at the Al melting point, and oxidation is complete
below 1300 K. However, the oxidation step caused by Al melting,
which was observed in steam,
is remarkably exaggerated in
H2O/CO2 mixtures. Its magnitude increases with increasing CO2
concentration although it is not observed at all in pure CO2.

Kinetic processing according to the formalism developed for dry
oxygen (see above) was attempted, as well as isoconversion anal-
ysis. Neither method can be expected to provide accurate results
because the geometric aspects discussed above were not rigorously
accounted for. The results of kinetic processing from Ref. [56] are
shown in Table 3 and may be useful for comparison purposes.

Ignition in oxygen or air

The reaction model described by Eqs. (1)e(4) and Table 1 was
used to describe ignition of aluminum powders in different
experimental configurations. Note that many practical situations,
e.g., ignition of aluminum particles in solid propellants [57], such
processes as agglomeration of molten unignited particles and par-
ticle interaction with binder can occur, making it more difficult to
develop an adequate model. Ignition of powders in a heteroge-
neous shock tube [58,59] offers a very simple configuration, where
particles can be assumed to be instantaneously introduced in a hot
gas. In shock tube experiments, ignition temperature is commonly
defined as the minimum gas temperature at which particle com-
bustion is observed. This situation was considered theoretically in
Ref. [39], where the reaction model introduced above was used to
calculate the heat release of particles inserted into hot air. Both
convective and radiation heat transfer terms were accounted for.

Fig. 15. Temperature histories and oxide layer thickness and compositions for 5-mm aluminum particles inserted in air at 1900 (left) and 2100 K (right) [39].

Results of this analysis are illustrated in Fig. 15. Top plots show
predicted evolution of the particle temperature. Bottom plots show
thickness of the growing oxide layer. Thickness is shown for each of
the three considered Al2O3 polymorphs: amorphous, g, and
a-alumina. The plots on the left represent a particle inserted in air
at 1900 K. The particle temperature approaches the ambient tem-
perature, but is not predicted to exceed it. Thus, ignition does not
occur. Conversely, the plots on the right illustrate what happens
when the air temperature is raised to 2100 K. The particle tem-
perature exceeds that of the environment, and thus ignition is
expected. The dashed portion of the predicted temperature trace
shows the range of particle temperatures, for which vapor-phase
reactions are expected to be significant. The model does not
include such reactions, and thus is not expected to predict the heat
release during vapor phase combustion accurately.

For particles of different sizes, environment temperature can be
exceeded when different alumina polymorphs are growing. Fig. 16
shows the temperatures, for which ignition is predicted to occur for
particles of different sizes [39]. A general trend of reduced ignition
temperatures for finer particles is consistent with that reported in
early research [60]. It is also shown in a literature survey presented
in Ref. [36]. Data from Ref. [61] are also shown in Fig. 16, where
threshold ignition temperatures were reported for different size
aluminum powders as found in heterogeneous shock tube experi-
ments. An increase in the ignition temperature with particle size is
predicted and observed experimentally. The general trend of the

tube experiments for ignition of aluminum powders of different sizes. Calculated curve

increased ignition temperature for particles of larger sizes is well
reproduced in the model. The discrepancy between predictions and
experiments is small for coarser particles. A sharper increase in the
ignition temperature with particle size is predicted than observed
in experiments. One critical difficulty in direct comparison between
calculations and experiments is that the experiments always use
powders with a relatively broad distribution of particle sizes. It is
not always clear whether the average or nominal particle size used
by an experimentalist to describe the powder accurately represents
the particles that most affect the ignition measurements. Another
likely reason for the model to overestimate the environment tem-
perature required for ignition for fine particles is powder agglom-
eration. Agglomerated particles have a specific surface area
representative of the primary particle size. At the same time, the
outer surface area of the whole agglomerate particle determines
the rate of heat exchange with the environment. Primary particles
in the interior of agglomerates find themselves in a nearly adiabatic
environment. Therefore, agglomerated particles self-heat faster
than individual spherical particles, and a correspondingly lower
environment temperature is required to trigger ignition.

The reaction model given by Eqs. (1)e(4) and Table 1 was also
used to interpret results of experiments, in which aluminum parti-
cles were ignited by passing through a focused CO2 laser beam [62].
In experiments, the laser power was increased in steps to determine
the minimum level necessary to ignite particles. When the power
was below the threshold value, particles heated by the laser were
observed to cool after passing through the beam. Conversely, self-
sustained particle combustion was observed at greater laser
energies. Particles were fed through the laser beam at different
speeds, and the minimum laser power necessary for ignition was
found for each particle speed. Thus, the experiment directly
addressed the effect of heating rate on the ignition temperature (for
certain well defined ambient conditions). In addition to the con-
vection and radiation heat transfer terms, interaction of the CO2
laser beam with the particle was described. The experiments were
performed with micron-sized particles and the model focused on
the particle size of 3.4 mm, which is heated by the CO2 laser beam
most effectively [63]. Heat exchange with the surrounding gas was
considered to occur in the transition regime [64,65]. In the model,
the laser power was varied to predict the level, for which the particle
temperature, increasing due to both laser heating and chemical
reaction, exceeded the melting point of alumina, 2320 K. It was
assumed that once that temperature is exceeded, vapor phase
reactions become significant and the particle is certain to ignite.

Experimentally, ignition was registered based on a bright and often
increasing light emission from particles exiting from the laser beam.
Using a threshold temperature as ignition criterion in the calcula-
tion does not describe ignition explicitly. In fact, the model is limited
to only describing the reaction for a limited temperature range, and
as long as the coreeshell geometry exists. However, it is reasonable
to stipulate that once self-heating raised the temperature to the
oxide melting point, the surface oxide coalesces into a droplet (the
experimentally observed oxide cap), the diffusion barrier imposed
by the oxide is at least partially removed, and the reaction rate
further increases. Examples of the particle temperature histories
predicted for different particle velocities and different laser powers
are shown in Fig. 17 [62].

Results of both calculations and experiments are summarized in
Fig. 18, showing threshold laser power necessary for ignition as a
function of the particle velocity (which, in this experiment, is the
primary means to change the particle heating rate). Calculation
results are shown for three diameters of the focused laser beam,
Dbeam; each diameter was selected to match exactly each experi-
mental data point. The range, in which the laser beam diameters
vary is relatively narrow and is consistent with the uncertainty in
defining this diameter experimentally. Therefore, comparison of
experimental and computational results presented in Fig. 18 further
validates the reaction kinetics shown in Table 1 and Eqs. (1)e(4),
which was derived based on thermo-analytical measurements,
as useful for describing ignition of aluminum particles at high
heating rates.

spherical Al particles were ignited by a CO2 laser in H2O/N2,CO2,
air, H2O/air and CO2/O2 gaseous environments [66]. The experi-
mental setup used was the same as for the experiments in dry
oxygen/air described above. The respective reactive gases were
introduced as a shroud flow around the stream of particles. Fluid
dynamic calculations confirmed that the atmosphere around the
particles was well mixed at the location of the CO2 laser beam.

In these experiments, as in the ones described above, the laser
power was adjusted until ignition and combustion was observed.
Particle velocity was the principal means to control particle heating
rate. Results for different environments are shown in Fig. 19. The
solid lines shown in Fig. 19 were calculated by assuming that the
reaction leading to ignition can be described by a single Arrhenius
term. The respective pre-exponent and activation energy were
treated as adjustable parameters. Further, the vapor phase com-
bustion detectable in these experiments occurs only for particles
above a minimum size, which depends on the environment [67],
and is not well known a priori. Therefore, the particle diameter was
treated as an adjustable parameter as well. The numerical results
are shown in Table 4. Activation energies, in particular, do not
compare reasonably to any of the results obtained by thermal
analysis above. This emphasizes that without a detailed mecha-
nistic model such as developed for oxidation and verified for
ignition in air, the global kinetic information obtained from specific
experiments cannot be extrapolated for quantitative description of
ignition for a range of conditions, i.e. heating rates, other than those
addressed in the experiments directly.

3. Exothermic reactions leading to ignition for intermetallics
(NieAl)

Exothermically reacting intermetallic NieAl composite mate-
rials have been studied extensively because of their applications for
combustion synthesis of NiAl [68e71], for joining as a heat source
for solder or braze, or even for direct welding [72e76], and for
enhanced ignition of aluminum-based metal powders coated or
mixed with Ni [77,78]. A variety of compositions, including coated
particles, multilayered foils, and composite powders with Ni and Al
mixed within each particle, were prepared and characterized over
the years. Multiple morphologies of the investigated NieAl mate-
rials explain a very large number of studies addressing respective

began with melting of Al [68]. Experiments on laser-ignited
Ni-coated Al particles, performed with different coating thickness
and considering structures of ignited and quenched particles [77]
were used to propose a mechanism illustrated in Fig. 20.
Reactions begin with melting of Al and include formation of Al3Ni
and Al3Ni2 at increasingly higher temperatures, prior to the for-
mation of NiAl as the final product.

Most recently, combustion was shown to be triggered at tem-
peratures as low as 230 (cid:4)C [84,85] for nano-composite NieAl
structures. These, seemingly contradictory reports can be recon-
ciled taking into account the information about NieAl reactions
obtained from multiple TA studies, combined with detailed ana-
lyses of the final and intermediate products. Earlier applications of
TA measurements for reactions in various reactive nanofoils,
including NieAl, were reviewed in [86].

A reaction sequence identified by TA measurements in a NieAl
composite is illustrated in Fig. 21 using combined results from
Refs. [81] and [87]. In Ref. [81], a composite powder prepared by
ball milling was characterized. For the material milled for 97% of the
time at which the material would react as a result of mechanical
initiation, the powder primarily included Al and Ni nanolaminate
layers that were less than 30 nm thick. At shorter milling times (75,
50, and 25% of the critical time), the fine nanolaminate structure is
mixed with a respectively increased fraction of coarser, micron-
sized Ni and Al layers. The material studied in Ref. [87] was a
multilayered nanofoil prepared by magnetron sputtering. The
thickness of individual bilayers varied from 12.5 to 200 nm for the
measurements shown in Fig. 21. Most traces show three exothermic
peaks for both types of materials; the peak patterns are similar for
the sputtered and ball-milled composites. DSC traces obtained for
the nanofoils are labeled with the phases detected in the partially
reacted, quenched, and recovered samples. The three peaks
showing consecutive formation of three intermediate phases,
Al9Ni2, Al3Ni, and Al3Ni2 are particularly clearly resolved for the
50-nm bilayer foil. They are also well distinguished for the ball
milled powders prepared using 75, 50, and 25% of the critical
milling time. The second peak representing formation of Al3Ni may
be compounded of two separate events, which seem to be better
resolved for the 200-nm foil. For the finest nanofoil and for the

reactions. While it is not attempted here to provide a comprehen-
sive overview of the relevant publications, it appears that many of
the same reaction sequences and mechanisms were observed for
NieAl samples prepared by different methods and having different
morphologies. Some of the most useful measurements were per-
formed with the components mixed on the nano-scale by reactive
milling [79e81] or by sputter deposition of alternating layers [82],
forming multilayered nanofoils.

In the early combustion synthesis literature, it was reported that
the combustion begins when Ni melts [83]. Later, studies of
reactions in multilayer Ni/Al systems suggested that combustion

powder milled 97% of the critical time, peaks become broader and
appear to overlap. Note also that the peak locations for the two
sets of measurements do not coincide exactly with each other.
Because the measurements were performed at different heating
rates, 10 K/min [81] and 40 K/min [87], all peaks shift to higher
temperatures at greater heating rates, as expected. Peaks also shift
to higher temperatures as the average reactants spacing, defined by
milling time and layer thickness, increases.

Unfortunately, despite a very broad range of papers reporting TA
measurements of NieAl composites, measurements at systemati-
cally varied heating rates have only been briefly described in
Ref. [87]. Most authors considered how mixing morphology and
bulk composition affect the TA measurements, while using one
heating rate only. Thus, kinetics of individual reaction steps for the
intermetallic reactions is not well characterized.

Measurements at different heating rates processed using the
Kissinger method were used to evaluate activation energies for
formation of Al9Ni2, Al3Ni, and Al3Ni2 [87]. Respective activation
energies were reported to be 152.5 ± 5.8; 183.3 ± 9.6; and
165 ± 7.7 kJ/mol. The lower the activation energy, the greater the
temperature shift for the respective reaction at changing heating
rates. The peak temperatures, predicted to occur at various heating
rates for different reaction steps based on the data and kinetics
reported in Ref. [87] are shown in Fig. 22. The difference in the
reported activation energies is rather small, and the peak order is
predicted to persist for a very broad range of heating rates. Inter-
estingly, at heating rates between 106 and 107 K/s, relevant to
combustion applications, the formation of Al3Ni is predicted to
occur right near the aluminum melting point, which is also shown
for reference. If aluminum melts before the intermetallic forms in a
high heating rate experiment, the sequence of NieAl reactions is
expected to change. The analysis illustrated in Fig. 22 may be useful
if the reaction mechanism is well established and sustained at
substantially greater heating rates. For example, a somewhat
different reaction sequence in the heated NieAl nanofoils was
proposed in an earlier work [88]. It is proposed that a metastable
B2NiAl phase forms first, followed by the formation of Al3Ni.
Respective activation energies for the above consecutive reactions
were reported to be 77.2 and 144.7 kJ/mol. For such diverse acti-
vation energies, a change in the reaction sequence will be predicted
at high heating rates, unlike the situation presented in Fig. 22. It is
interesting that recent ignition experiments with NieAl nanofoils
[89] were interpreted considering a simplified theoretical model,

treating activation energy of the exothermic process as an adjust-
able variable. It was found to be 77.3 kJ/mol, matching closely that
reported by Michaelsen et al., for the first exothermic process in
their experiments [88].

There is a significant difference of NieAl reaction mechanism
from that involving oxidation of aluminum, either with gas phase
oxidizer or reacting with a condensed metal oxide. In all aluminum
oxidation reactions, the product is condensed Al2O3, which typi-
cally forms a chemically inert, protective layer at the reaction
interface. As a result, the rate of reaction is commonly controlled by
diffusion of reactants through this layer. For NieAl reactions,
various intermetallic products form, which serve as precursors for
the formation of other intermetallic phases. The reaction rate can
be limited by either diffusion of reactants through the formed in-
termetallics (similar to aluminum oxidation) or decomposition of
the precursor phase and nucleation of new intermetallics. Thus,
qualitatively different reaction mechanisms may occur if the
intermediate intermetallic does not grow thick enough to pose
diffusion resistance, or even does not form at all, e.g., at greater
heating rates. Because of this difference, relying on the low heating
rate measurements to predict the reaction sequence at higher
heating rates for this system may be difficult.

Fig. 23. Integrated peak areas and temperature during the reaction (including cooling.) Because the Al3Ni2 (110) and (102) peaks could not be resolved from one another and from
the AlNi(110) peak, they are represented as one data series labeled “AlNi”. The area is measured from the AlNi(110) peak and the Al3Ni2(110) and Al3Ni2(102) peaks (which cannot be
differentiated spatially) [23,90].

Fortunately, a range of new experimental methods enabling one
to probe the rapidly reacting material in situ is being developed.
Several such methods have recently been applied to characterize
reactions in the NieAl system. Reactions in a 30-mm thick, sputter
deposited foil with 70-nm layers of aluminum alternating with
30-nm layers of Ni (including a 7% V impurity) were studied using
time-resolved synchrotron X-ray microdiffraction in Ref. [90]. The
foil was ignited and x-ray diffraction patterns were collected from a
60-mm spot with 55 ms temporal resolution. In separate experi-
ments, temperature profiles were measured for the same com-
busted foils. The observed heating rates were close to 106 K/s. The
processing of XRD patterns is summarized in Fig. 23, where the foil
temperature history is also shown. No intermediate phases were
detected in these measurements. An amorphous phase was initially
produced, which transformed directly into AlNi. This reaction
sequence appears to be consistent with that proposed in
Refs. [86,88]. It was also confirmed by DTEM measurements [91].
Considering reaction temperatures estimated for the relevant high
heating rates in Fig. 22, it is possible that aluminum melting did
happen before formation of intermediate intermetallic phases.
Upon cooling, equilibrium Al3Ni2 formed. It is unclear whether in
these rapidly reacting samples there were no intermediate phases

observed in DSC experiments, or whether the intermediates
formed but could not be detected because of limitations of either
temporal or spatial resolution. It is also possible that the interme-
diate crystallites were too small to be detectable.

A newly developed semiconductor based nanocalorimeter was
used to characterize reactions in AleNi nanofoils [18]. NieAl
bilayers with thickness varied from 25 to 60 nm were directly
deposited onto a thin Si-based sensitive element. The samples
were then initiated by electrically heating the chip. Temperature
and power as functions of time were measured; heat losses were
assessed preliminarily using a bare chip. Typical experimental
data are shown in Fig. 24. The sample reacts during the first
heating pulse, resulting in a marked increase in the observed
heating rate. During the second heating, the temperature rises
with a slowly decaying rate, due to increased heat losses at higher
temperatures. Processing the temperature traces enables one to
recast the measurements in terms of real time heating rates; the
difference between the first and second heating is directly
attributed to the exothermic reaction of interest. The heating rates
are in the order of 104 K/s, much faster than in traditional DSC, but
still lower than those observed in the relevant self-propagating
reactions.

A baseline measurement with the reacted material enables one
to establish the reference heat capacity and convert the data into
heat release as a function of time. The heating rate does not remain
the same when the sample reacts, which needs to be accounted for
while interpreting the results. The reactions were measured in
(cid:2)7 Torr. This methodology was
vacuum, with a base pressure of 10
combined with dynamic transmission electron microscopy (DTEM)
in Ref. [92]. It was observed that in experiments performed at
heating rates of the order of 2∙104 K/s, the sequence of exothermic
peaks registered by the nanocalorimeter, including formation of
Al3Ni, Al3Ni2, and NiAl, agrees with that detected at much lower
heating rates by regular DSC. Validating the estimate illustrated in
Fig. 22, peak positions detected by the nanocalorimeter were close
to those predicted based on the Kissinger processing of earlier DSC
results with similar nanofoils [18]. Furthermore, absolute reaction
enthalpies were evaluated and compared with those detected by
DSC at much lower heating rates. The comparison is illustrated in
Fig. 25, and the match between the two measurements is quite
remarkable.
In follow up experiments combining the nano-
calorimeter with DTEM [92], performed with average heating rates
of 830 K/s, it was further confirmed that the general sequence of
intermetallic phases, Al3Ni / Al3Ni2 / NiAl,
formation of
observed in many DSC experiments was sustained. Formation of
Al3Ni2 was observed to occur during both second and third
exotherms.

Heat release and kinetics of exothermic reactions observed to
occur in the heated NieAl system and characterized by TA mea-
surements should be used to interpret multiple ignition experi-
ments involving related materials system. Unfortunately, many
present models describing ignition do not take into account reac-
tion kinetics. Instead, they focus on the bulk heat release charac-
terizing formation of the final NiAl. Qualitatively, the effect of
heating rate and its significance in terms of relative contribution of
solid state reactions for ignition was discussed in Ref. [93]; however
no direct use of reaction models implied by TA measurements was
made. A similar qualitative discussion is offered in Ref. [94], where a
decrease in the ignition temperature of the compacted NieAl
composite was observed at heating rates increasing in the range of
10e330 K/min. Clearly, each specific system would require its own
ignition model, accounting for the particular sample shape,
morphology, and associated transport processes. However,
although heat transfer may be described in sufficient detail, as, for
example, is done in Ref. [95], the theory developed there did not
account for the reaction kinetics. Thus, it may only be suitable for

very slow heating and will not work for experimental situations
when greater heating rates are involved. It will also be unable to
describe the propagation of a combustion wave through an ignited
intermetallic material.

4. Reactions leading to ignition in thermites

4.1. Conventional micron-scale thermites

Thermites comprising a blend of a readily oxidized metal,
typically aluminum, and a readily reduced metal oxide, typically
iron oxide, were known since early 20th century [96e98]. The
redox reaction generates copious amounts of heat and a molten
metal, such as iron. Classic applications of thermite reactions
involve welding of large size metal components, e.g., train rails,
which remain an active area of innovation [99e102]. As in the rest
of the article, only reactions involving aluminum as a metal fuel are
discussed here, although thermites with other metals, such as
magnesium or zirconium have been studied.

For conventional thermites, using micron-sized powders of both
metal and oxide, ignition is difficult to attain. Extensive heating is
required; aluminum-based thermites should be heated well above
the melting point of aluminum, e.g., to 1600 K [103,104] in order to
achieve ignition. Although this temperature is still lower than the
melting point of bulk aluminum oxide, it comes close to the
depressed melting point expected for the nano-scale natural oxide
layers covering aluminum powders [105]. Multiple TA studies of
reactions in regular micron-scale thermites are reported in the
literature, consistently showing the first exothermic peak to occur
after aluminum melting, in the temperature range of 1100e1300 K
[106,107], as shown in Fig. 26. The magnitude of the exothermic
peak and its exact temperature depend on the method used to mix
metal and oxidizer, which in turn, alters the metal-oxidizer contact
surface area. However, there appears to be no systematic effect of
the oxidizer used in thermite on the position of this peak. The peak
position correlates with stage III of aluminum oxidation, as shown
in Fig. 1. This stage corresponds to a diffusion-limited growth of
g-Al2O3 following its formation from the original amorphous
alumina.

TA experiments at different heating rates are reported in
Ref. [107]. Positions of the first exothermic peak shifted to higher
temperatures at greater heating rates. The data were processed by

tracking the peak positions, and using an isoconversion method as
introduced by M.J. Starink [108]. Results of that processing,
following Ref. [107], are plotted in terms of the effect of heating rate
on position of the first exothermic peak in Fig. 27. The trend line
obtained in Ref. [107] is extrapolated to higher heating rates. It is
interesting that it approaches 1600 K at about 10 K/s, which is a
reasonable heating rate to be expected for the experiments using a
furnace to heat up a pile of a thermite mixture as reported in
Ref. [104].

It is, therefore, reasonable to assume that the first exothermic
peak observed in multiple TA studies of micron-sized thermites
represents a reaction leading to the thermite ignition. As with other
reactions involving oxidation of aluminum, it is further reasonable
to assume that the rate of this reaction is limited by diffusion of
reacting components through the growing surface alumina layer.
Comparing Figs. 1 and 26,
it is possible to suggest that the
specific process limiting reaction is diffusion-controlled growth of
g-Al2O3. A depressed melting of a few nm-thick alumina may
further accelerate the diffusion rate; however, this effect cannot
be unambiguously supported by the currently available experi-
mental data.

4.2. Thermites using nano-sized aluminum powders

In the last couple of decades, significant attention was paid to
thermites with nano-sized metal and oxide particles, referred to as
superthermites, e.g. [109e111], or metastable interstitial compos-
ites (MIC), e.g., [112e116]. Because of substantially increased reac-
tive interface area in such nano-thermites, ignition occurs at much
lower temperatures and can be attained quickly. The low-
temperature ignition enables rapid propagation of the flame front
over the nano-thermite charge, rapid heat release, and often gen-
eration of a pressure pulse associated with combustion. These
features of nano-thermite combustion are attractive to a broad
range of applications involving energetic formulations, from pyro-
technic devices, to propellants, and to explosives.

Considering substantial interest in MIC materials, multiple TA
studies of reactions in such materials were reported in the litera-
ture. While only some of the published reports are considered in
this review, exothermic reactions are consistently detected at
temperatures lower than the aluminum melting point for MIC

materials prepared by mixing nano-aluminum with different
oxides. A clear illustration of the shift of the first exothermic peak to
lower temperatures is shown in Ref. [117], when micron-scale
aluminum is replaced by a nano-powder in an AleFe2O3 ther-
mite. A summary of selected published DSC measurements for
different nano-Al-based thermites is shown in Fig. 28. Each trace
comes from a different literature source, so the experiments were
performed under slightly different conditions and at different
heating rates. However, all exothermic peaks are observed at
temperatures in the range of 700e900 K, all below the aluminum
melting point. Specific shape and location of the peak for each
thermite depends on exactly how the powders were mixed and in
what proportion, what particle size distribution was used, and
other experimental details. Mixing method, in particular, is very
important. For example, in Ref. [118] the exothermic peak in the
AleFe2O3 nanothermite prepared by ultrasonic powder mixing is
barely noticeable, while the peak shown in Fig. 28 from Ref. [117] as
well as peaks from the powder blends prepared nominally in the
same fashion [119] are rather strong. Note that the exothermic peak
for AleI2O5 system taken from Ref. [120] is shifted to higher tem-
peratures and is narrower than other peaks. This is likely because
the measurement in Ref. [120] was made at a relatively high
heating rate of 47 K/min, whereas other measurements were taken
at 5 and 10 K/min. In Ref. [121] reaction onset detected at 10 K/min
for AleI2O5 is reported at a much lower temperature, 582 K;
however, the measurements were severely affected by endo-
thermic decomposition of
I2O5. This decomposition is not
mentioned in Ref. [120].

Despite a large number of reports describing DSC traces and
respective exothermic reactions in various nano-thermites, only a
few authors performed experiments at systematically varied
heating rates to quantify kinetics of these reactions [120] [122],
[123]. A summary of TA analyses, including activation energies
reported for several specific thermite systems is given in Table 5.
Also included in Table 5 are ignition temperatures for thermites
using the same metal oxide as oxidizers and measured using a
heated filament method [124]. A 76-mm diameter platinum fila-
ment coated with nano-thermite is heated at about 5$105 K/s in
vacuum. Ignition is detected optically. To compare TA measure-
ments with experimental ignition temperatures, Doyle's approxi-
mation [44] was used. This approximation, serving as basis for a

where E is activation energy, b is heating rate, R is the universal gas
constant, and T is the characteristic temperature at a specific degree
of conversion. Taking the position of the exothermic peak detected
in DSC measurements as a characteristic point with a specific degree
of conversion, peak temperature reported for a specific heating rate
can be used along with the reported activation energy to identify the
constant in Eq. (8). Once this constant is found, one can estimate a
temperature at which the exothermic peak is expected to occur for
the high heating rate used in the ignition experiments. This esti-
mated temperature is also shown in Table 5. The experimental
ignition temperature matches the estimated temperature of the
exothermic peak only for AleFe2O3. For all other thermites, the
experimental ignition temperature is much lower than the estimate.
The discrepancy shows that the TA measurements cannot be use-
fully processed to predict ignition temperature for most thermites
prepared by mixing Al nanopowder with oxidizer powders.

The discrepancy between predicted exothermic peak tempera-
ture and experimental ignition temperature is hard to understand
without introducing additional processes not detected by TA
measurements. Decomposition of the oxidizer and generation of a
gas-phase oxygen was considered as a potential trigger of thermite
ignition [127]. However, it was shown that the kinetics of such
decomposition does not always correlate with the observed igni-
tion kinetics [124].

One such process that cannot be observed by TA measurements
is the recently described effect of reactive sintering, a change in the
shape and size of nano-aluminum particles upon rapid heating
[128]. In particular, in Ref. [129], a change of the reactive interface
between Al and WO3 nanoparticles was observed after the sample
was heated at 106 K/s to 1473 K. Although the melting point of Al2O3
was not exceeded, molten Al particles appeared to be affected by
capillary forces, so that molten aluminum partially covered the
surface of WO3 particles. This formed a new interface between Al
and WO3, which is likely qualitatively different from the original
natural alumina layer preventing aluminum oxidation. Clearly,
reactions at such new interfaces are no longer rate-limited by
transport through the original alumina layer. It may be difficult or
even impossible to observe formation of similar interfaces in TA
measurements, even if the temperatures are sufficiently high.
Because the heating leading to high temperatures is slow, the
extent of reaction occurring at low temperatures is substantial. The
original oxide layer may grow significantly and become much more
mechanically rigid compared to the initial
thin amorphous
alumina. Thus, even at temperatures substantially greater than the
aluminum melting point, the particles may be constrained by their
thicker and more rigid oxide shells.

A quantitative description of the thermite reaction occurring
without the natural amorphous alumina separating reactants may
be obtained considering TA experiments with nano-thermites
prepared as layered or fully-dense composite structures, as dis-
cussed below.

4.3. Thermites prepared as nano-sized layered structures

Most of the layered thermites are prepared using vacuum
deposition of different reactant layers [130e133]. All reported ex-
periments dealt with the AleCuO system; TA measurements were
reported for all synthesized nano-foils. Interestingly, the onset of
the exothermic reactions reported in Refs. [130e133] is in the
temperature range of 700e800 K, which is consistent with that
shown in Fig. 28 for the thermites prepared as mixtures of nano-
aluminum powder with oxides. This may be surprising consid-
ering that the interface between deposited layers of Al and CuO
does not have to be similar to the natural amorphous alumina.
Characterizing this interface in detail is difficult. Deposition inevi-
tably raises local surface temperature and thus reaction between Al
and CuO is accelerated. Detailed electron microscopy and Auger
depth profiles reported in Refs. [130,131] suggest that CuO is
partially reduced in the vicinity of the interface and a pre-mixed
layer with thickness of several nm exists between aluminum and
copper oxide. In Ref. [134] focus was on modifying the interfacial
Al/CuO layer by altering deposition process. Two samples were
prepared: one, with CuO deposited directly onto Al, and the other,
where interfacial Al2O3 layers were prepared by atomic layer
deposition. DSC traces showed that the main exothermic peak
occurred at similar temperatures for both materials, however, small
spurious exothermic peaks were noticed in the DSC trace of the
material prepared without an additional Al2O3 layer. For materials
without an additional Al2O3 layer, the exothermic reactions were
noted to begin at lower temperatures, 623e673 K; however, the
reactions were
characterized
quantitatively.

4.4. Thermites prepared as fully dense nano-composite powders

These materials are prepared using Arrested Reactive Milling
(ARM) [135]. The powders are fully dense micron-sized particles, in
which ~100-nm oxide inclusions are embedded into an aluminum
matrix. Thermites using MoO3 [136e141], CuO [142e147], Bi2O3
[148,149], Fe2O3 [59,150,151] and other oxidizers were prepared
and characterized. More complex, ternary systems were also pre-
pared, but will not be discussed here. Reactive interfaces between
aluminum and an oxidizer in such powders are produced at low
temperatures between newly formed aluminum surface and
oxidizer inclusions. Although formation of some intermixed layer is
inevitable, such layers are expected to be substantially thinner than
a natural alumina film existing on surface of aluminum exposed to
an oxidizing gas environment.

Detailed TA measurements were performed and interpreted for
AleCuO [142e145,147] and AleMoO3 [137,139,152,153] thermites
prepared by arrested reactive milling. Characteristic DSC traces for
both materials are shown in Fig. 29. Exothermic processes are
detected to begin at markedly lower temperatures than for ther-
mites prepared by blending nano-sized Al powder with oxidizers,
shown in Fig. 28. The reactions in Fig. 29 are already observed at
temperatures below 400 K for both materials; relatively strong
exothermic peaks are located between 600 and 700 K. The re-
actions include multiple steps, which made it possible to interpret
them considering the sequence of polymorphic phase changes and
diffusion-controlled growth steps for individual Al2O3 polymorphs,
observed in oxidation of aluminum (cf. Figs. 1 and 2). Minor
adjustments for individual kinetic parameters, compared to those
given in Table 1, enable one to reasonably describe the exothermic
features observed for nano-composite thermites at temperatures
above 600 K. Such adjustments are reasonable because the struc-
tures and stabilities of individual Al2O3 polymorphs are expected to
be affected by the presence of other oxides. However,
low-
temperature reactions could not be successfully described consid-
ering this model despite any adjustments in the activation energy
or pre-exponent for the first exothermic process, growth of an

studies

low-
temperature reactions exploited isothermal and scanning micro-
calorimetry using a TAM III calorimeter by TA Instruments
[144,145,153,154]. Reaction rates were quantified at temperatures
as low as 303 K for Al$MoO3 and Al$CuO thermites. Typical
experimental data are illustrated in Fig. 30 [153,154]. For both
materials, the heat release is well quantified and a strong function
of temperature. As expected, the heat release decreases in time,
presumably because of the growing thickness of the interfacial
product layer between aluminum and oxidizer. Reaction rate for
Al∙MoO3 decreases more rapidly at higher temperatures and at
extended reaction times. This effect is most likely due to the
structural changes leading to a greater diffusion resistance of a
thicker, densified product layer. Such processes are ignored in
further discussion because they are most likely irrelevant for
analysis of ignition, when heating occurs rapidly and the growth of
the product layer thickness is very limited.

As with the DSC experiments shown in Fig. 29, and discussed
above, a clear discrepancy between the observed reaction rates and
predictions using a model relying on thermally activated diffusion
was observed [154], even when the thickness of the initial oxide
layer was assumed to be as small as 0.3 nm. The main issue was that
the diffusion model failed to reproduce the shapes of the measured
heat release curves for either constant heating rate or constant
temperature experiments.

To reproduce experimental data, an additional reaction step
preceding the stepwise growth of aluminum oxide layer was
required. Because the interface between aluminum and oxidizer in
materials prepared by ARM was expected to be very thin, a model
based on the Cabrera-Mott (CM) formalism [155] was considered.
As initially introduced, the CM model describes the growth of an
oxide layer on a pristine metal surface exposed to a gaseous
oxidizer. The mass transport of metal ions to the oxide-gas interface
is accelerated by an electric field, referred to as Mott potential,
produced across the growing oxide layer. The electric field is caused
by charge separation between the diffusing ionic species, primarily
oxygen ions. The effect of the electric field diminishes rapidly as the
thickness of the oxide layer increases, and for aluminum it disap-
pears when the oxide grows beyond 1e2 nm. Although the
mechanism of the generation of the Mott potential across an

interface produced between two solid reactants remains subject of
active research [156], CM model was applied to such an interface
earlier [157]. Following that work, and modifying the CM equations
for an interface produced around a spherical oxide inclusion in
a metal matrix [158], the CM model was applied to describe an
early reaction in nanocomposite thermites produced by ARM
[144,145,147,153,154]. Effectively, the CM reaction describes growth
of the Al2O3 film thickness h, as:

where T, is temperature, k0 and E1 represent the Arrhenius pre-
exponent and activation energy, respectively, R is the universal gas
constant, kB is the Boltzmann constant, f(h) is a geometric term
describing the interface shape and thickness, and the parameter E2
represents the effect of the Mott potential on the rate of mass
transfer. For a planar interface, f(h) 1⁄4 1 and for a spherical oxide
layer growing around an oxidizer inclusion in a metal matrix, f(h) is
the ratio of the radii of the Al2O3 shell and the oxidizer core. An
additional assumption of the starting thickness, h0, of Al2O3 layer is
required to apply the model. Because the initial interface between
aluminum and oxidizer may not necessarily be a stoichiometric
Al2O3 film, this starting thickness is not likely to represent its actual
thickness. Instead, it is an effective thickness of a precursor phase,
which transforms into Al2O3 during the reaction. Detailed analyses
of TA measurements focusing on the low-temperature reactions
identified the CM model parameters, which are shown in Table 6
and describe such reactions for both Al$CuO [144,145,147] and
Al$MoO3 [153] nanocomposite thermites. Term E2, the contribution
of the Mott potential, is treated as a linear function of temperature
following Ref. [144]. The effect of temperature on the Mott potential
was discussed in more detail elsewhere, see for example Ref. [159].
The model using parameters from Table 6 describe adequately
such low-temperature heat release measurements as illustrated in
Fig. 29 (see Ref. [147] for corresponding calculations) and 30 (see
Ref. [153]). A broad range of heating rates, including very low rates
(0.0083e0.0033 K/min [153]) was covered experimentally and
interpreted theoretically. In addition, measurements with powders
prepared using different milling conditions were also well
described [147]. Combining CM model with the multi-step mech-
anism describing polymorphic phase changes and growth of
different Al2O3 polymorphs enables one to quantitatively repro-
duce TA measurements for the ARM-prepared powders for a broad
range of temperatures [145].

The model describing reactions in ARM-prepared materials was
combined with the heat transfer analysis to analyze ignition of such
materials
Ignition was
considered for individual composite particles passing through a
CO2 laser beam and for a powder coated on an electrically heated
filament [145]. In the laser ignition experiments, the minimum
power of the CO2 laser was identified, for which ignition of Al$CuO
composite particles was observed. In the model, the laser heating
was described as well as heat losses from a particle to the room
temperature air. Heat release was calculated taking into account the

multi-step reaction model,
including CM reaction followed by
phase changes and diffusion limited growth of different alumina
polymorphs. A comparison of the experimental optical emission
traces and calculated temperature histories for a composite particle
crossing the laser beam is shown in Fig. 31 [145]. In calculations, the
particle is assumed to move at a constant speed crossing the laser
beam. This speed is obtained from experimental data. In the
calculated plot, time zero corresponds to the instant the particle
enters the laser beam. In experimental plot, the time axis is shifted
arbitrarily to provide the best comparison with calculations,
whereas the time scale is the same in both cases. In experiments,
the minimum laser power at which ignition occurred was 5.3 W. In
calculations, a rapid temperature jump was predicted at this power,
as shown in Fig. 31. A more detailed analysis shows that the tem-
perature jump is due to the combined effect of CM reaction and
diffusion-limited growth of the amorphous alumina. The timing of
the predicted particle heating is compared well with the experi-
mental particle emission trace. The temperature jump was not
predicted for laser powers lower than 4.3 W, which was considered
to be an acceptable match with experimental data. Thus, the model
developed based on TA measurements was well capable of pre-
dicting ignition in the ARM-prepared materials.

However, the same reaction model could not predict substantial
heating for powder placed on an electrically heated filament. The
calculations suggested that the thermal contact between the fila-
ment and the powder was so strong that any heat released by the
exothermic reaction would be readily absorbed by the filament. The
powder temperature would never increase substantially above the
filament temperature. A very weak temperature spike was pre-
dicted at the temperature at which ignition was readily detected
experimentally [145]. To reconcile the model predictions with the
experimental data, an additional process needs to be accounted for.
The thermal decomposition of metal oxide (e.g., CuO, MoO3, or
others) is observed to occur and produce gas phase oxygen [127].
The gas release was quantified at high heating rates, typical for
ignition [148]. The thermal contact between the powder particles
and the filament is disrupted when oxygen is released by the
decomposing oxide. Qualitatively, it is expected that as a result of
such disrupted thermal contact, the exothermic reactions predicted
to occur lead to substantial self-heating of the composite particles
and to their ignition, as observed in experiments.

In TA experiments, this process would not be observable.

desired. In addition, the gas release to the atmosphere would be so
slow as to be undetectable.

Finally, it is interesting to comment that in the heated filament
experiments, the ignition of the ARM-prepared thermites occurs at
temperatures that are very close to the ignition temperatures for
the nano-thermites prepared using blends of nano-sized aluminum
powders [140]. Although natural oxide exists on surface of indi-
vidual aluminum nanoparticles, it was suggested above that a new
heterogeneous reaction surface may be produced in such materials
as a result of reactive sintering. If new reaction interface is formed,
where natural alumina does not separate aluminum from the
oxidizer, the Cabrera-Mott model introduced above may offer an
adequate approach for describing reactions leading to ignition. For
a quantitative model, the reactive interface area would need to be
specified, which would likely depend strongly on surface interac-
tion between molten aluminum with different metal oxides used as
oxidizers.

5. Common caveats of interpreting TA measurements

The most common cause for misinterpretation of TA measure-
ments involving highly exothermic processes, such as oxidation of
aluminum, is associated with effective loss of temperature control
of the heated sample. As result of an exothermic reaction, a part of
or the entire sample often self-heats above the set temperature. In
the TG trace, this often is reflected by an apparently very rapid
weigh increase, occurring at nearly constant temperature [160]. If
this happens, the reaction rate cannot be assigned to a known
temperature, and kinetic information cannot be derived from the
measurement. Further, reaction products can be formed due to
several simultaneous reactions occurring in parts of the sample
heated to different temperatures. The latter scenario explains why
mixed oxides were detected in TG products in Ref. [14]. In summary,
it is important to avoid situations, causing loss of temperature
control in TA measurements. Common practical solutions involve
using smaller sample mass, lower heating rates, diluting the sample
with an inert material, or using sample pans with a greater thermal
conductivity.

Another common problem associated with a large sample mass
may be encountered when a reactive gas environment is used, and
the surface of the entire sample is not equally accessible to the
surrounding gas. This problem is more difficult to detect; the most
direct practical approach may be to repeat the same measurement
with a different sample mass. Reaction kinetics should be inde-
pendent of the sample mass when the experiment is designed
properly.

Often samples partially reacted and recovered from interrupted
TA experiments are examined to elucidate the reaction mecha-
nisms. It should be taken into account that the samples continue
reacting and changing during cooling, and thus never represent the
actual state of the reaction at elevated temperatures. In addition,
samples can be altered by handling as was clearly shown in
Ref. [52]. Similarly, sample handling must have caused formation of
broken oxide shells in Ref. [32], while the authors offered a
different explanation involving poorly quantified internal stresses
in the particles.

Finally, many TA experiments with reactive materials are
focused on establishing and characterizing reactions leading to
ignition. Identifying such reactions among all exothermic processes
observed in TA measurements is important. For aluminum, such
reactions were shown to be occurring at rather low temperatures in
the TA experiments;
furthermore, these were not the most
exothermic reactions observed. Reactions releasing most heat in
the TA experiments often shift to much higher temperatures at
higher heating rates, making them irrelevant for ignition. For

example, it appears that focus on such high temperature reactions
was made in Ref. [34]. Thus, kinetic analysis of the TA data should
always be performed and results compared to those observed in or
anticipated for the ignition experiments. Such comparisons are
helpful in identifying which reactions or reaction steps are most
relevant in describing ignition, typically occurring at much higher
heating rates than TA measurements.

6. Conclusions

Rapid development of thermo-analytical instruments made TA
measurements common in studies of ignition of reactive and en-
ergetic materials. In particular, such measurements were exten-
sively used to describe reactions leading to ignition in diverse
aluminum-based reactive materials. For all such materials, TA
measurements identified multiple exothermic reactions, many of
which occur at temperatures below the aluminum melting point.
Controlled temperatures and heating rates enabled researchers to
identify specific reaction steps; furthermore, kinetic parameters for
many observed exothermic processes were quantified. The multi-
step reaction models developed based on TA measurements may be
useful in describing reactions leading to ignition for some, but not
all aluminum-based reactive materials.

For pure aluminum reacting in oxygen, a detailed multistep
reaction model appears to be adequate for describing ignition
occurring at much higher heating rates. An analogous detailed
model has not yet been developed for aluminum reacting in CO2,
H2O, or gas mixtures. An approach involving an “effective oxidizer
concentration” is shown to be inadequate for such modeling
because of changes in the structure and respective diffusivity of the
oxide film growing in different oxidizing media. TA measurements
can also be used to establish the location of the reactive interface
for aluminum reacting in different gaseous oxidizers when the data
are interpreted taking into account size distributions in poly-
disperse powders. Current results identify key differences in the
reaction mechanisms in different oxidizers, including location of
the reaction interface for dry and humid environments, in partic-
ular. Accounting for such differences and using detailed TA mea-
surements is expected to lead to practically useful ignition models
for pure aluminum.

Exothermic reactions in Al-based intermetallics were consid-
ered using the most widely studied NieAl system as an example.
Multiple reactions were reported to occur in NieAl materials pre-
pared using different methods and initiated using different heating
rates. Most interestingly, recent measurements employing nano-
calorimeters enabling heating rates in the range of 104 K/s
confirmed the reaction sequence observed in much slower, tradi-
tional TA experiments. At the same time, formation of intermediate
phases could not be distinguished in in-situ x-ray measurements in
experiments with samples heated at 106 K/s.

Reactions in aluminum-based thermites are the most complex
of all considered here. Such reactions involve decomposition of
oxidizers into new phases and release of intermediate gas species.
At high heating rates, reactive sintering of the finely mixed particles
can occur, changing dramatically the interface area and thus
affecting the reaction rate in a way that cannot be characterized by
slow TA measurements. In some of the prepared nano-thermites,
initial interface layer between metal and oxidizer is poorly char-
acterized, yet, properties of this interfacial layer are critical for
understanding the ensuing redox reaction. Simultaneous decom-
position of the oxidizer is also difficult to characterize using TA
measurements. This process, depending on the equivalent reducing
environment, to which the oxidizer is exposed, occurs simulta-
neously with the highly exothermic redox reaction. It may be
significantly affected by the heating rate, causing different reaction

mechanisms to become important at different sample initiation
conditions. In particular, oxidizer decomposition and release of
gaseous products may disrupt the structure of the reactive material,
and thus substantially affect heat transfer governing ignition pro-
cesses. These effects limit substantially applicability of kinetic
models obtained from TA measurements for description of ther-
mite ignition.

Despite the limitations noted above, the TA measurements are
seen as extremely valuable in identifying reactions that may play a
role in ignition processes. Considering results discussed for all three
types of reactive materials addressed here, it is suggested that
ignition cannot directly be observed in a well-designed thermal
analysis measurement. Direct extrapolation of TA results to heating
regimes that lead to ignition is therefore generally not useful.
However, the reaction mechanisms elucidated by the TA mea-
surements should always serve as a solid foundation for the
development of an ignition model. In all cases considered, several
exothermic reactions, each with its own kinetics, were found to be
important. Often the mechanism and rate of each specific reaction
are affected by the preceding reactions, defining, for example the
thickness and structure of the interfacial layer separating reacting
species. Such preceding reactions may occur to a different extent,
depending on the rate of temperature change, or heating rate. In
some cases, the actual reaction sequence can change as a function
of the heating rate. Further, reactions that could not have occurred
in low heating rate TA experiments because of thicker product
layers existing at specific temperatures may become feasible for
rapid heating, when a thicker product layer did not have time to
form. Thus, direct translation of the reaction sequence observed in
TA measurements to model ignition may not often be possible.

In summary, TA measurements are always useful in identifying
and characterizing exothermic reactions leading to ignition. How-
ever, the reaction mechanisms identified by TA measurements may
be modified substantially at elevated heating rates, especially, for
more complex reacting systems. Independent validation experi-
ments in which materials are heated rapidly are always necessary
to validate or limit applicability of the TA-based reaction models for
describing ignition processes.
