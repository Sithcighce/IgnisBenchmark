The overarching objective of the present endeavor is to demonstrate the universal character of com-
bustion phenomena for various areas of modern physics, focusing on inertial confinement fusion (ICF) in
this review. We present the key features of laser deflagration, and consider the similarities and differ-
ences between the laser plasma flow and the slow combustion front. We discuss the linear stage of the
RayleigheTaylor instability in laser ablation, short-wavelength stabilization of the instability due to the
mass flow, and demonstrate the importance of the concepts and methods of combustion science for an
understanding of the corresponding ICF processes. We show the possibility of the DarrieuseLandau
instability in the laser ablation flow and discuss the specific features of the instability at the linear and
nonlinear stages as compared to the combustion counterpart of this phenomenon. We consider the
nonlinear stage of the RayleigheTaylor instability in the ICF and generation of ultra-high magnetic field
by the instability, and show that proper understanding of vorticity production in the laser plasma and,
hence, of the magnetic field generation requires concepts from combustion science.

1. Introduction

1.1. Universality of transformation fronts in nature

Modern technical civilization is based on combustion as its
primary source of energy and power, and hence prosperity [1e4].
As a consequence, combustion science is traditionally considered as
an applied branch of physics e one which is based on chemically
reacting flows and has the goal of, for example, improving the ef-
ficiency and emission quality of engines and burners, mitigation of
fire and explosion hazards, and development of chemical muni-
tions [5e8]. While such an emphasis is abundantly rational, it has
nevertheless also steered the study of combustion from other forms
of transformation processes that are not necessarily chemical in
nature, such as thermonuclear, electromagnetic or biological, and
for applications that are not of immediate societal and in fact
the
terrestrial concern, such as the astrophysical events of

supernovae and star formation. The above observation basically
puts in a nutshell the diversity of natural processes and problems of
modern physics that can be rightfully claimed as within the realm
of combustion, the breadth of potential scientific contributions that
can be further harvested,
for the prosperity and intellectual
development of mankind, by using the ideas and methods of
combustion science, and the joy in research discovery that such
transdisciplinary activities can bring.

To demonstrate the diversity of phenomena that a generalized
combustion study can encompass, let us consider the propagation
of a generalized “combustion flame front” in a self-supporting
manner in different media. Fig. 1 shows some examples of large-
scale fronts that are not traditionally tackled in the studies of the
“hard-core” physics, such as those of information or decease
spreading, expansion/extinction of biological populations, dy-
namics of landscapes such as deserts or rainforest in geo-science,
weather fronts in meteorology, propagation of signals in the

human body, and historical events such as the migration of peoples.
Even if we restrict our consideration to physics only, examples of
front-like phenomena are numerous including combustion, ioni-
zation, streamers, doping of semiconductors, propagation of
domain walls in ferromagnetics and ferroelectrics, phase transition
such as crystal growth, etc. In this sense, combustion science offers
the universal fundamental methods of answering the questions:
What is a front? Which types of fronts one would expect? How can
we study fronts in the most effective way? What can we say about
front dynamics and stability?

instability,

As a further illustration of the richness of the front dynamics,
and also focus further to a phenomenon that pervades in physical
fronts and is of central importance in combustion fronts, we next
consider the celebrated DarrieuseLandau (DL) instability [1e4].
The DL instability wrinkles an otherwise smooth premixed flame-
front and is the basis to the (correct) claim that all premixed flames
are intrinsically unstable if allowed to expand continuously and
unobstructed [9e12]. The DL instability is quite under-appreciated
of the fundamental hydrodynamic instabilities as compared to the
RayleigheTaylor
the KelvineHelmholtz (KH)
instability, the RichtmyereMeshkov instability, and others. For
example, the DL instability is not included in the classical textbook
of Chandrasekhar on the hydrodynamic and hydromagnetic in-
stabilities [13]. Possible reasons for the relatively less attention to
the DL instability are its suppression by finite flame thickness in
small, lab-scale flames, as well as the belief that its effect on
flamefront wrinkling is secondary to those of turbulence which
prevail in engine combustion [5e8]. However, recent studies at
elevated pressures, which reduce the flame thickness and hence
favor the emergence of DL instability, have unambiguously
demonstrated its existence in high-pressure environments [14], see
Fig. 2, which prevail, for example, in internal combustion engines.
The DL instability leads to a number of remarkable effects of
fundamental interest for hydrodynamics and nonlinear physics
such as the potential development of the fractal structure of flames
leading to the self-similar acceleration of expanding flames and
spontaneous flame self-turbulization [12,14e19]. Deflagration-to-
detonation transition in free space due to the flame acceleration
has been discussed [20] as an alternative to the traditional mech-
anisms of such transition in channels and ducts due to wall-friction
and obstacles [21,22]. A number of recent papers have also recon-
sidered the impact of the DL instability in a turbulent flow envi-
ronment even for turbulence of noticeable strength with a broad

spectrum [23e27]. Furthermore, the DL instability has been
encountered in studies of the thermonuclear supernovae [28e30],
in inertial confinement fusion [31e38] and in quark-hadron phase
transitions in the early Universe [39e41]. Similar instabilities of
electromagnetic nature have been discovered recently in organic
polymer semiconductors and in crystals of nanomagnets, with the
electric and magnetic fields playing conceptually the same role as
the gas flow for the DL instability in combustion [42e45]. In
addition, understanding of the DL instability has led to solutions of
a new class e the de Broglie spinning solitons e for the relativistic
quantum HamiltoneJacobi equation [46]. Consequently, the DL
instability turns out to be rather interesting from the fundamental
point of view in many subjects of modern physics far beyond the
traditional applications of combustion science.

Importance of combustion phenomena and methods in inertial

1.2.
confinement fusion, astrophysics and advanced materials

The above discourse and examples lead us to the main purpose
of the present series of reviews, namely to demonstrate the
importance of ideas, methods and phenomena of combustion sci-
ence for a variety of problems of modern physics from astrophysics
to advanced materials. In fact, some of these unconventional ap-
plications of combustion science are not new at all; they were
recognized nearly half a century ago. For example, understanding of
thermonuclear supernovae was based on the fundamentals of
combustion science from the very beginning when the thermo-
nuclear mechanism of supernova explosions was elucidated
[47e50]. Indeed, the similarity between chemical reactions in
combustion and thermonuclear reactions in supernovae is too
straightforward to be missed. In inertial confinement fusion the
methodology of combustion science (in particular, of the DL theory)
provided a clue to the long standing problem of the stabilization of
the RT instability by the laser ablation flow, with the major
breakthrough in the problem achieved about two decades ago
[31,51e53], even though the similarity between combustion and
laser ablation (laser deflagration) is still not fully appreciated and
properly employed at present. The interest in flame theory and
combustion science is expected to be renewed in scope of the
recently started activity of producing the ultra-high magnetic field
by the hydrodynamic instabilities in laser fusion plasmas [54e60].
Finally, the most recent and the most surprising unconventional
applications of combustion science have been encountered in the

studies of advanced materials within the past few years for the
crystals of nanomagnets [61e66] and organic polymer semi-
conductors [42,43,67].

To elucidate a unifying framework in studies of the various
phenomena involving fronts, we consider in general a medium,
which can be either in state 1 or 2, characterized for example by
different energy, density, temperature, conductivity, magnetiza-
tion, etc. We require that one of the states is metastable (the “un-
burnt fuel mixture”), while the other one is stable (the “burnt
matter”), so that transition from the metastable to the stable state is
favored (for example, providing “energy release”). Another impor-
tant feature of the propagation of a self-supporting front is an en-
ergy barrier (“activation energy”) between the states, which
hinders the spontaneous transition from the metastable to stable
state everywhere, but requires some support (“heating”) from the
neighboring layers. Then the transition may be started (“ignited”)
locally, and it spreads through the medium due to certain physical
mechanism (thermal conduction or shock), which facilitates the
transition. Such a transition process may be usually described as a
front, i.e., a propagating zone strongly localized in space, where the
transformation takes place.

Because of the diversity of phenomena considered and the
massive amount of information to be synthesized, we shall present
the subject matter in a series of reviews. The present, on inertial
confinement fusion, is the first of three such reviews, which will be
followed by reviews on combustion in the astrophysical media and
pseudo-combustion in advanced materials. The present review is
organized as follows. In Section 2 we present the key features of
laser deflagration in inertial confinement fusion, and consider the
similarities and differences between the laser plasma flow and the
traditional slow combustion front. In Section 3 we discuss the linear
stage of the RT instability in laser ablation, focusing on the stabi-
lization due to the mass flow and demonstrate the importance of
the methods of combustion science for correct understanding of
the effect. In Sections 4 and 5 we show the possibility and inves-
tigate the specific features of the DL instability in the laser ablation
flow, and in Section 6 we consider the nonlinear stage of the RT
instability in ICF. We shall show in due course that application of
the concepts and methods in flame propagation facilitates the
study of
the corresponding laser-ablation front dynamics,
morphology and associated plasma flow properties including
vorticity production.

2. The key features of the laser-supported deflagration in
inertial confinement fusion (ICF)

2.1. Toward ICF

The development of fusion energy is the second important item
among the 14 grand engineering challenges of the 21st century
identified by the American National Academy of Engineering [68].
Technically, in order to ignite thermonuclear reactions to produce
fusion energy, a deuteriumetritium plasma, which is the thermo-
nuclear fuel, needs to be confined at sufficiently high density and
temperature for sufficiently long time, so that the so-called Lawson
ignition criterion is satisfied [69e72]. Upon ignition, the thermo-
nuclear reaction

2H þ 3H/4He þ n

is initiated with the release of 17.6 MeV energy, out of which
3.5 MeV goes to helium and 14.1 MeV to the neutron. However, in
spite of half a century of
intensive research struggling with
obtaining proper confinement to achieve ignition, propagation of
thermonuclear reactions in the ICF has yet to be attained. At

present, the strategies of magnetic and inertial plasma confinement
are considered as the most promising. In the magnetic approach,
the hot dense thermonuclear fuel plasma is confined by use of
magnetic fields of a complex geometry, as one finds in tokamaks
[73e75]. In the inertial fusion approach, a thermonuclear target is
compressed by inertial force to high densities and temperatures to
initiate the reaction [70e72]. In this case the confinement time is
noticeably shorter than that for magnetic confinement, while
(cid:2)3 at temperatures of
achieving higher densities, up to 1025 cm
(107e108) K (i.e. ~5 KeV).

The first laser system designed to demonstrate ignition of
deuteriumetritium targets in ICF is the National Ignition Facility
[72,76,77], which has been operational since 2009. As the present
review was in the process of final editing, the first results were
reported of the energy gain in ICF experiments exceeding the en-
ergy input [78]. The required compression and ignition in ICF may
be attained when irradiating the spherical thermonuclear target by
high-power lasers, particle beams or soft X-rays as sketched in
Fig. 3. The energy absorbed by the target capsule surface drives
shocks into the target. The initially solid target and the ablator
capsule are converted into plasma, with the capsule material
expanding into vacuum, and the thermonuclear target compressed
due to the reaction force. The plasma outflow is driven by the so-
called ablation process e laser-supported deflagration, which
propagates into the target and provides heating and expansion of
the plasma in the flow. Although the natural geometry of the ICF is
that of a spherical target, Fig. 3(a), a large number of studies e
experimental, theoretical and computational e have focused on
similar effects for planar targets, Fig. 3(b), which simplifies the
theoretical analysis of, for example, the RT instability, while over-
looking geometry effects.

2.2. Main regions in the laser ablation flow

The laser deflagration demonstrates straightforward similarity
to a premixed flame e the slow combustion front. In that sense, the
release of chemical energy in the slow combustion is conceptually
replaced by the energy of the laser radiation partly absorbed and
partly reflected at the critical surface (label “c”) in the ablation flow
as sketched in Fig. 4. The basic properties of the ablation flow arise
from the dispersion relation for electromagnetic waves in plasmas.

instead of adiabatic character, at least in the vicinity of the critical
surface, due to the large values of thermal conduction of the hot
plasma. In the reference frame of the critical surface, taking the
laser deflagration front propagating along the z-axis, the rarefac-
tion wave may be described as.

the rarefaction wave propagates with respect to the plasma flow

Since the plasma density to the right of the critical surface in
Fig. 4 should be lower than rc, then the flow of the expanding
heated plasma takes the form of a rarefaction wave. It has been
demonstrated [80e83] that the rarefaction wave has an isothermal

acceleration acts as an effective gravity with acceleration g and
hence produces a nonuniform density distribution in the heavy
layers of the target, see the left-hand side of Fig. 4. The nonuniform
density distribution of the target may be roughly described as the

non-stationary, with ra(t), g(t), etc., which introduces additional
complications to the problem. Few papers on the subject developed
the approach of a self-similar non-stationary laser deflagration flow
taking into account the finite size of the plasma target [84e86].
Instead, most of the work employed the simplified model of an
infinitely large target placed in an external gravitational field as
illustrated in Fig. 5(a), e.g., see Refs. [31e33,35e38,51e53] with the
purpose of imitating the intrinsically non-stationary laser ablation
by a stationary flow with similar physical properties.

In the reference frame of the stationary laser deflagration
(ablation) front, the cold plasma moves toward the front with the
deflagration front speed Ua. The model is therefore analogous to
that of the slow combustion front propagating upward in a gravi-
tation field with a planar flame speed of Uf, illustrated in Fig. 5(b).
Due to the slow e almost incompressible e plasma flow in the cold
heavy layer of the target, the cold plasma ahead of the laser
deflagration front becomes approximately uniform for that model,
and the flow may be taken quasi-stationary, except for the rare-
faction wave at the back side of the laser deflagration front.

2.3. Structure of the laser deflagration front

The central element of the laser deflagration flow is the front
itself, i.e., the central parts of the flow in Figs. 4 and 5(a). Within the
laser deflagration front the heat is transferred from the critical
surface to the cold heavy plasma, and the mass is ablated from the
cold target to the vacuum through the critical surface. Strictly
speaking, the laser deflagration front includes the region of the
laser light absorption, which is represented by an infinitely thin
critical surface, and the region of heat transfer, which determines
the main length scale in the problem. In the case of a slow com-
bustion front, Fig. 5(b), we find similar regions of energy release in
the chemical reactions and heat transfer from the reaction zone to
the cold fuel mixture, which increases the temperature, initiates
the reaction and enables the front to propagate. In the stationary
reference frame, the laser deflagration flow is described by the
conservation of mass, momentum and heat transfer.

where UR describes the energy gain due to laser light absorption, k is
the coefficient of thermal conduction and CP z const is the heat ca-
pacity at constant pressure. In the case of laser deflagration, heating
is needed to reduce the plasma density from the cold heavy target to
the relatively low critical density, which enables the laser radiation to
propagate to new portions of the plasma. It is further noted that,
compared to flames,
laser deflagration has strong influence of
compressibility effects close to the critical surface, and the plasma
coefficient of thermal conduction, k(T), has strong dependence on
temperature. Indeed, in contrast to laser deflagration, planar flows
associated with laminar flames are noticeably subsonic, with the
(cid:2)2 [2e4].
typical limitation for the Mach number Ma ≡ Uf/cs < 3$10
The CJ deflagration regime may be attained by usual flames only due
to strong bending and corrugations of the front in the process of the
spontaneous flame acceleration in the deflagration-to-detonation
transition [87e89]. Usual flames are also characterized by rather
weak temperature dependence of the thermal conduction coeffi-
cient, kf
, which is often taken as constant, k z const, in com-
bustion studies [9e12]. On the contrary, the coefficient of thermal
conduction of the laser plasma depends quite strongly on tempera-
ture. For example, in the case of electron thermal conduction one has
k f T5/2, while radiation thermal conduction may involve even
stronger dependence, k f T13/2 [51e53,79e82]; the laser plasma
experiments suggest the dependence in the form of a power law
k f Tn with n 1⁄4 0.7e3, e.g. see Ref. [90].

The strong temperature dependence of thermal conduction
leads to an important effect of spatially-varying length scales in the
laser deflagration flow. In the case of flames, the characteristic
length scale in the flow Lf, often referred to as the flame thickness, is
determined by thermal conduction as.

For example, in the case of the electron thermal conduction with
n 1⁄4 5/2 and the temperature ratio at the critical and ablation sur-
faces Tc/Ta 1⁄4 16, we find the two length scales differ by three orders
of magnitude, Lc/La z 103.

2.4. The ablation surface: can it be considered as a discontinuity?

Strong temperature dependence of plasma thermal conduction
also leads to strong temperature and density gradients in the cold
plasma layers, which are often interpreted as another discontinuity

in the flow called the ablation surface [80e83]. We consider the
region of heat transfer (to the right of the critical surface in Fig. 4)
with UR 1⁄4 0 and negligible plasma compressibility, u2 ≪ CPT. Then
Eq. (12) can be readily integrated as.

where za is the position of the ablation surface. For strong tem-
perature dependence of the thermal conduction coefficient, n > 1,
typical for laser plasmas, the scaling law Eq. (17) results in diverging
temperature gradients at the ablation surface, z / za, as illustrated
in Fig. 6. For the incompressible (isobaric) flow one finds rT z const,
and the region of high gradients is similar for both density and
temperature profiles. In the case of noticeable flow compressibility
(finite Mach number) the large gradients are typically smoothed.
Fig. 7 shows the density profiles calculated in Ref. [37] for the
density ratio Q ≡ ra/rc 1⁄4 6 and different values of the Mach number
at the outflow: Mac 1⁄4 0; 0.5; 0.75. It is noted that Ref. [37] was
focused on the influence of the compressibility effects on the DL
instability and hence considered the Mach number as a free
parameter, which also required a model construction for the energy
release term spreading the process over a zone of finite width. The
region of high density gradients in the cold plasma is clearly
observed for the incompressible flow, Mac 1⁄4 0. Still, these gradients
become smoothed with increasing Mach number in the flow
because of the temperature ratio Tc/Ta decreasing with Mac as
compared to the density ratio Q ≡ ra/rc. The two ratios are related
by using mass and momentum conservation, Eqs. (10) and (11), as

There have been numerous attempts at interpreting the ablation
surface as a discontinuity, e.g. in studies of the linear RT instability
in ICF [91e95]. Here we point out that such an approach is ques-
tionable and typically incorrect for the common parameters of the
ICF laser flow. Indeed, a certain region may be interpreted as a
surface of discontinuity only when the width of this region is much
smaller than the characteristic length scales external to the region.
It is demonstrated below that the formulated condition typically
fails for the ablation plasma by using Eq. (17) to find the inverse
relative gradients in the flow as

realistic in light of the experimentally measured values n 1⁄4 1e3 and
for the electron thermal conduction with n 1⁄4 5/2. With some
caution, the model of a discontinuous ablation front may be
employed for the radiative thermal conduction with n 1⁄4 6.5. The
same conclusion follows from the density and temperature profiles
in Fig. 6.

Quite often another minor “discontinuity” in the density profiles of
the ablation flow is associated with the critical surface and may be
observed in the inset of Fig. 7. With the Mach number approaching the
maximum possible value Mac 1⁄4 1=
, we can see the development of
a small region of relatively high density gradient in the energy release
zone. This effect may be understood analytically from mass and mo-
mentum conservation, Eqs. (10) and (11), in the laser deflagration flow
[37]. Close to the critical surface, with the isothermal sonic flow con-
dition Uc 1⁄4 cTc 1⁄4

power series with respect to r/rc (cid:2) 1 [ 1, 1 (cid:2) T/Tc [ 1, we obtain the

Taking the energy gain in the form of a d-function, we find
temperature attaining the final value Tc smoothly at z / zc, which,
however, leads to a square-root singularity in the density gradient.

although the singularity is moderated because of the finite width of
the zone of energy gain.

Finally, an important difference between flame and laser
deflagration concerns the speed of front propagation. In the case of
a flame, the propagation speed Uf is determined by thermal con-
duction and the characteristic time of chemical reactions tR, and it
may be evaluated qualitatively as Uf
, [1]. Mathematically,
the flame speed is found as a solution to the eigenvalue problem
based on Eq. (12), see Refs. [2,9,12]. On the contrary, absorption of
the laser light in the ablation flow occurs infinitely fast as compared
to the hydrodynamic length and time scales [80e83], and hence the
laser deflagration speed, Ua, is determined by the boundary con-
ditions at the critical surface and the energy flux in the intrinsically
time-dependent rarefaction wave. To find the ablation speed one
has to consider the time-dependent energy transfer equation with
the energy gain term in Eq. (12) taken in the form UR 1⁄4 I$d(z (cid:2) zc),
where I is the absorbed laser irradiance. By integrating the energy
equation over the entire flow and using properties of
the
isothermal rarefaction wave, Eqs. (5) and (6) with g 1⁄4 5/3 charac-
teristic of completely ionized plasmas, we find the balance of en-
ergy fluxes at the critical surface determined by the absorbed laser
irradiance [80e82].

3.1. Universality of the RT instability in nature

In spite of the substantial technological progress and develop-
ment in ICF in the last decade [76e78], hydrodynamic instability,
which degrades the symmetry of the target compression and could
even destroy the target completely, remains the main obstacle in
achieving ignition and as such is the limiting factor in fusion per-
formance and efficiency [96,97]. In general, the RT instability con-
verts the excess of the potential energy in a system into the kinetic
energy of the flow and belongs to the most fundamental, powerful
and universal hydrodynamic processes. The instability arises at the
interface between two fluids (gases, plasmas) of different densities,
when the light matter is supporting the heavy one in a gravitational
field g [13,35,98], as illustrated in Fig. 9. The gravitational field
driving the instability may be real, as one finds in stars
[47e50,99,100], or analogous, as it
is encountered in ICF
[31,35,51e53]. Indeed, by adopting the non-inertial reference frame
of the heavy target illustrated in Figs. 3 and 4, we obtain the cold
heavy layers of the thermonuclear fuel supported by the light
heated plasma of the ablation flow in the effective gravitational
field of the target acceleration. Thus the flow becomes RT unstable
with crucial consequences for the target compression and energy
implosion. Another interesting example of the RT instability due to
effective gravity has been demonstrated recently in the hydrody-
namics of quantum gases (BoseeEinstein condensates) [101,102]. In
that case the gradient of a non-uniform magnetic field is used to
press the BoseeEinstein condensates with different atomic spins
toward each other, thus increasing the potential energy of the
system and driving a quantum counterpart of the RT instability. The
quantum RT instability has been suggested for effective mixing of
quantum gases and generating a novel (spinor) type of quantum
turbulence [102].

Lately there has also been much interest in the RT instability
generated by an effective time-dependent gravity [103e105].
Within the context of combustion, such effective gravity may be
created by the acoustic and shock waves producing periodic and
pulse “gravitational acceleration” in closed and semi-closed com-
bustion chambers [106e108]. These effects are also related to the
parametric (Faraday) instability developed through flameesound
interaction [109e113], and to the RichtmyereMeshkov instability,
which is a close relative of the RT instability [114e117]. In a sense,
the RichtmyereMeshkov instability may be considered as the RT
instability

Since the interface between the heavy and light plasma in ICF is
not passive but rather propagates as a laser-deflagration front, it
was recognized long ago that the estimate scl is too crude for the
ablation instability: the RT instability in the laser ablation flow
grows noticeably slower than it is predicted by Eq. (32), and be-
comes completely suppressed for perturbations of sufficiently short
wavelengths, see Refs. [118e121]. The results of early experiments
and numerical solutions on the subject are summarized in a model
empirical expression known as the Takabe formula [118,119].

perturbation wavelength lmax z 21.6 mm, with the flow parameters
adopted from Ref. [122]. One can see strong reduction of the RT
instability growth rate described by the Takabe formula as

forward calculation yields the growth rate twice smaller than the
classical value for lmax. Fig. 10(b) demonstrates good agreement of
the Takabe formula with early numerical simulations of the ablative
RT instability growth rate [121].

It is further noted that the Takabe formula involves two
empirical coefficients, a, b, which have been adjusted to provide the
best fit to the numerical solution. The first coefficient, a, was sup-
posed to reflect large but finite density ratio in the ablation flow,
being similar to the factor

the ablation RT instability as the discontinuity model with the mass
flow through the interface. An attempt of solving the problem
encountered the difficulty of the matching conditions at the
discontinuity surface as illustrated in Fig. 12. Indeed, in the classical
problem of the RT instability we find three matching conditions at
the inert interface: two continuity conditions (mass conservation)
with no penetration and one condition of pressure balance (normal
component of momentum conservation). The problem involves
also three unknown amplitudes: for the two potential (degenerate
sound) modes decaying at infinity on both sides of the interface and
the amplitude of the interface perturbations as illustrated in
Fig. 12(a). Then the eigenvalue stability problem may be success-
fully resolved yielding the dispersion relation, s(k), Eq. (32). The
condition of energy conservation and the respective modes are not
required for the problem solution [1,13].

In the case of an interface with mass flux, Fig. 12(b), we also have
the interface: one for mass

three matching conditions at

the unstable ablation interface, being often represented by using
the ablation flow velocity Ua 1⁄4 _ma=r

there have been numerous attempts to improve this formula, for
example, by taking into account the finite thickness of the unstable
ablation zone, L, resulting in a modified expression to Eq. (33) as

3.3. The RT instability at a discontinuous interface with mass flux

An important feature of Eq. (33) is the assumption that the co-
efficient b is just a numerical factor independent of the flow length
scales La or Lc. Such an assumption implies indirectly that the sta-
bilization problem of the RT instability by the ablation flow may be
solved within the model of a discontinuous interface between the
heavy and light plasma similar to the classical result, Eq. (32).
However, numerous attempts to solve this problem have demon-
strated that it is ill-posed within the discontinuity model [91e95].
Presumably, Bodner [91] was the first to formulate the problem of

Obviously, Eq. (36) does not describe any stabilization of the RT
instability due to the mass flow; instead, the increase in the
instability growth rate is due to the combined RT and DL in-
stabilities. In the limit of vanishing gravity Eq. (36) describes the DL
instability growth rate alone.

The most important conclusion, which follows from Eq. (36) in
the context of the ablation stability problem, is that the empirically
suggested stabilization of the RT instability, Eq. (33), cannot be
explained within the discontinuity model. In order to describe the
stabilization, one has to take into account the finite thickness of the
front and analyze its structure, as it was done in the combustion
science within the theory of the DL instability by Pelce and Clavin,
see Refs. [9e11,125]. In particular, by using Taylor expansion for
perturbations of sufficiently long wavelengths, one can obtain the
stabilization within the first-order terms in kLc ≪ 1, see Ref. [31].

3.4. Short wavelength stabilization of the ablative RT instability

The most relevant limit for describing ablative stabilization of
(cid:2)1 ≪ Lc, for which the perturbation
the RT instability is La ≪ k
wavelength is much smaller than the distance to the critical sur-
face, but much larger than the thickness of the ablation surface, as
illustrated in Fig. 13. In fact, the Takabe formula, Eq. (33), has been
(cid:2)1 ≪ Lc. Within this
also suggested to describe the same limit, La ≪ k
limit and assuming temperature-dependent thermal conduction,
k f Tn, Bychkov et al. [31] obtained an expression for the cut-off
wave number kc, for which the RT instability is completely stabi-
lized by the ablation flow as

Equation (38) was derived in Ref. [31] with focus on electron
thermal conduction, n 1⁄4 5/2. Stabilization of the ablative RT insta-
bility similar to Eq. (38) was also obtained independently by Sanz
[126] by applying asymptotic techniques. We point out the simi-
larity between the theoretical prediction Eq. (38) and the empirical
result for the cut-off wave number Eq. (34). A remarkable result is
that the right-hand side of Eq. (38) varies rather moderately within
the limits 0.08e0.17 for the scaled cut-off wave number, changing
by two orders of magnitude, kcLa 1⁄4 0.01e0.6, see Fig. 14, plotted for

conservation and two for the normal and tangential components of
momentum conservation (for a 2D flow). At the same time, the
problem involves four unknown amplitudes: for the two potential
(degenerate sound) modes similar to the classical problem, for the
vorticity mode decaying at infinity in the downstream flow, and for
the eigenvalue problem is
the interface perturbation. Thus,
underdetermined and cannot be solved without an external
matching condition e this is known as the deficit of boundary
conditions. The deficit persists in 3D for which additional matching
of the tangential momentum is offset by an additional unknown
vorticity mode. Furthermore, by including energy conservation as
was done for example in Ref. [91], the additional matching condi-
tion is again offset by the additional entropy mode in the down-
stream. Indeed, while a large number of work has suggested
different extra conditions at the interface [91e95], they have led to
substantial scattering of the conclusions about the influence of the
mass flow on the RT instability growth rate. Furthermore, even
qualitatively there is lack of agreement on the role of the mass flow
within the discontinuity model and it is not clear, for example,
which particular region in the laser ablation flow should be
replaced by the discontinuity: the ablation surface only, some part
of the flow close to the ablation surface, or the entire laser-
deflagration front from the ablation to the critical surface.

Strictly speaking, the same deficit of boundary conditions also
exists in the stability analysis of flames. Darrieus and Landau cir-
cumvented this difficulty by additionally assuming that the front
propagates with the speed of the classical, 1D, steady, planar flame
in the doubly infinite domain [1,2,9,12], thereby ignoring the front
structure and consequently the coupled influence of the flow and
the front curvature on the front propagation. For laser deflagra-
tion, the problem was closed in Ref. [31] within the model of an
incompressible flow keeping a strong temperature dependence of
electron thermal conduction characteristic for ICF, k f T5/2. The
discontinuity in Ref. [31] involved the entire deflagration front
from the ablation to the critical surface. For an incompressible
flow, the additional condition at the discontinuous front has been
demonstrated to degenerate to the DL condition of constant
deflagration front speed [31], and the dispersion relation re-
produces the classical DL result for a flame front propagating
upwards.

4.1. The key questions of the DL instability in laser ablation

The DL instability is another hydrodynamic instability of com-
bustion type arising in the laser ablation flow, which contributes,
together with the RT instability, to the ablation front bending.
Although the DL instability is not as strong as the ablative RT
instability, it may initiate the latter with subsequent destruction of
the target symmetry. In combustion, the DL instability makes a
slow flame front spontaneously corrugated and increases the
burning rate [1,2,9e12]. As combustion flame is the most typical
example of a deflagration front, the DL instability is also expected to
develop for other types of deflagrations, e.g., in ICF and astro-
physical processes such as the quark-hadron phase transitions in
the early Universe [39e41] and type Ia Supernovae [29,30,48]. In
the context of ICF, the theoretical possibility of the DL instability has
been identified first in Refs. [31], see Eqs. (36) and (37), although
within the oversimplified isobaric flow model, which describes
laser ablation only qualitatively.

Fig. 15 defines the physical mechanism of the DL instability
arising at an initially planar flame front slightly wrinkled because of
perturbations. Due to mass conservation at the flame front, run -
1⁄4 const, the normal component of the gas velocity un increases by
the factor Q 1⁄4 rf/rb > 1 as the gas element passes from the fuel
mixture (label “f”) to the burnt matter (label “b”) in the burning
process. Since the tangential velocity component ut remains un-
changed due to momentum conservation [1,2], then the flow
streamlines are refracted at the curved flame front as shown
schematically in Fig. 15. Refraction of the streamlines leads to
reduced velocity of the fresh gas at the humps (streamlines
diverge), and increased velocity at
the troughs (streamlines
converge). Thus, the humps propagate even faster, and the troughs
are even more retarded, which leads to the positive feedback be-
tween the flamefront perturbations and the flow and thus to the DL
instability.

The classical theory of the DL instability at a slow combustion
front is developed within the incompressible approximation for the
unburnt and burnt mixtures [1,2,9e12], which is markedly different

are in a good agreement with the empirical evaluations of the cut-
off wavelength of the Takabe formula, Eq. (34). Thus, the results
[31] provided basic understanding for the ablative stabilization of
the RT instability in ICF. A conceptually important element of the
solution is that the stabilization involves finite width of the ablation
zone (non-negligible values of kcLa) and hence finite role of thermal
conduction, which controls the ablation thickness La, see Eq. (14).
This conclusion is principally different from the numerous attempts
to describe the stabilization within the discontinuity model
[91e95], which neglected thermal conduction and finite front
thickness by definition. Later work [51] calculated the cut-off wave
number kc using a mathematical method different from Ref. [31],
but arrived at a result almost identical to Eq. (38) within the ac-
curacy of factors deviating slightly from unity by a few percent,
about 1.03.

The theory by Bychkov et al. [31] for the ablative RT stabilization
and cut-off has been further developed by groups of Betti et al.
[51e53], Sanz et al. [33], Clavin et al. [34,127], and others. In

expansion has been employed in a similar way in describing ther-
mal stabilization of the DL instability in combustion [9e12]. Pre-
dictions of Eq. (40) for La 1⁄4 0.25 mm demonstrate a good agreement
with the empirical Takabe formula plotted for a 1⁄4 0.9, b 1⁄4 2.5 and
with the numerical data Ref. [121] as shown in Fig. 10.

A number of studies have also addressed the limit of ultimately
short wavelength perturbations, kLa [ 1, associated with large
values of the target acceleration [31,53,128]. It was found that the
short wavelength perturbations are localized in the zone of

Accounting for gas compression, one finds the dispersion rela-
tion for an infinitely thin deflagration front in the same form
s 1⁄4 GUak, but with the coefficient G depending on the Mach
number, G(Q, Mac). More general solution to the stability problem
considers finite thickness of the deflagration front, which leads to
stabilization of the DL instability at sufficiently short wavelengths.
For slow combustion flames of finite thickness, the analytical so-
lution to the problem has been obtained by Pelce and Clavin
[9e12,125] as Taylor expansion to the first order terms in relatively
small perturbation wave number, kLf ≪ 1,

where kc is the cut-off wave number, lc 1⁄4 2p/kc is the cut-off

The approximation of a small cut-off wave number, kcLf ≪ 1, holds
with reasonable accuracy for usual flames [12]. The cut-off wave-
length is proportional to the flamefront thickness, lc f Lf. In
incompressible flows, the proportionality coefficient depends on
the expansion factor Q and on the type of thermal conduction. For
k f Tn inherent to laser plasmas and keeping the simplified
approach of an incompressible flow, the theory [9,125,135] yields

with the total deflagration thickness Lc determined by Eq. (14). For
electron thermal conduction, n 1⁄4 5/2, and characteristic expansion
factors Q 1⁄4 6e8, Eq. (46) predicts the cut-off wavelength lc z 6Lc.
Radiation heat transfer implies a much stronger temperature
dependence [72,79], n 1⁄4 13/2, with the cut-off wavelength evalu-
ated as lc z 2.5Lc for Q 1⁄4 6e8, which is a considerably smaller value
as compared to electron thermal conduction regime. Thus, stronger
temperature dependence k f Tn with n [ 1 leads to reduction of
the scaled cut-off wavelength as lc/Lc f 1/n, as an asymptote of Eq.
(46). As an opposite case, thermal conduction is almost tempera-
ture independent for usual combustion flames, and the scaled DL
cut-off is much larger, lc/Lf z 20 for Q 1⁄4 6e8, see Ref. [12]. The
dispersion relation (45) predicts the maximum DL instability
growth rate smax for the perturbation wavelength lmax 1⁄4 2lc, which
makes these perturbations the most representative at the linear DL
instability stage.

4.3. Linear DL instability in the laser ablation flow as compared to
the classical case

Accounting for gas compression, one should expect that all DL
instability parameters G, lc, lmax and smax depend on the charac-
teristic Mach number in the flow, Ma. Modestov et al. [37] inves-
tigated the dependence on the Mach number at the hot side of the
ffiffiffi
deflagration front, Mac, varying within the domain 0 < Mac < 1=
g
in between the slow combustion and laser ablation limiting cases.
To make such variations possible, Ref. [37] adopt a specific form for
the energy release term U in Eq. (12), which allowed a uniform
outflow of heated plasma downstream of the energy release zone.
As demonstrated in Ref. [37], the key features of the DL instability
depend quite strongly on flow compressibility.

p

Fig. 16 presents the scaled instability growth rate versus the
perturbation wave number found numerically in Ref. [37] for Mach
numbers Mac 1⁄4 0e0.73, with the density ratio Q 1⁄4 6. The DL
instability becomes much stronger with increasing Mach number,

from the laser ablation parameters in ICF. Laser ablation corre-
sponds to the isothermal CJ deflagration, which is the fastest
possible deflagration regime with the isothermal sonic point
attained at the critical surface of laser light absorption, as shown in
Section 2. Besides, thermal conduction in laser plasma depends
strongly on temperature, which makes the internal structure of
laser deflagration quite distinctive from the flame-front structure.
The strong plasma compression and the specific type of thermal
conduction are expected to influence significantly the key param-
eters of DL instability in laser-generated plasmas. Research on the
DL instability in ICF has focused on the following important ques-
tions [32,33,35e38,129e133]:

1) How strong is the DL instability in laser ablation in comparison
to the classical case; is it stronger or weaker than the DL
instability at a slow flame-front?

2) What is the characteristic length scale of the DL instability
development? The answer to this question is of special impor-
tance for the experimental diagnostics of the ablative DL
instability as it determines the target size required for the DL
instability observations;

3) What is the outcome of the DL instability at the nonlinear stage?

A number of studies tried to answer the first question in the
limit of a discontinuous ablation front [32,36,131e133]. These
discontinuous models encounter the deficit of matching conditions
at the front, see Section 3.3, and the solutions obtained turned out
to be sensitive to the assumed extra matching condition [31,91e95].
The discrepancy remained even at the qualitative level: the ques-
tion about the strength of the laser ablation DL instability as
compared to the classical case (stronger, weaker, or the same) has
been answered in different ways in different papers based on the
discontinuity model [32,36,131e133]. Unlike that, Ref. [134] took
into account a continuous structure of the deflagration (combus-
tion) front in a compressible flow, hence eliminating the deficit of
the matching conditions for a fast combustion front. A similar
method has been employed in Ref. [37] to study the linear stage of
the DL instability in a laser plasma, thus answering questions 1 and
2 posed above.

4.2. Basic properties of the linear DL instability at a slow
deflagration front

In the classical case of an infinitely thin flame front propagating
in an incompressible flow, the DL instability growth rate was ob-
tained by Darrieus and Landau [1,2] as s 1⁄4 GUfk, Eq. (37), where the
coefficient G(Q) depends on the density ratio Q only.

which is exhibited by all the instability parameters. The factor G
characterizing the DL instability strength at an infinitely thin front
is demonstrated in Fig. 17 versus the Mach number. Compared by
the factor G, the DL instability is almost twice stronger for laser
ffiffiffi
ablation (Mac 1⁄4 1=
) than in the incompressible flow (Mac 1⁄4 0).

The factor G obtained numerically in Ref. [37] is noticeably larger
than predicted by any analytical theory [32,36,131e133]. The
discrepancy indicates possible theoretical flaws caused by the
matching conditions deficit in the discontinuous ablation front
models employed in the theories. The matching conditions deficit,
however, does not occur in the numerical approach of Ref. [37]
involving a continuous front structure.

The numerical solution [37] has been also used for retrieving, as
much as possible, the missing matching condition and constructing
the analytical theory reasonably close to the numerical one. The
basic elements in the analysis [36] have been complemented by an
extra condition identical to that of the classical DL theory [1,2,131],

from the numerical solution, approximately by 35%.

Fig. 18 shows the maximum DL instability growth rate versus the

maximum instability growth rate is about three times larger than in
the incompressible case. Remarkably, the maximum growth rate
shows only minor dependence on the Mach number for a rather
wide range of this parameter, Mac < 0.5. The strong increase of smax
with Mac takes place only when the Mach number approaches the
limiting value Mac 1⁄4 1=

maximum growth rate smax calculated for radiation energy trans-
port, n 1⁄4 13/2, is almost three times larger as compared to the
electron one. Considerable decrease of the cut-off wavelength for

the cut-off wavelength found numerically in Ref. [37] for different
values of the Mach number to the theoretical prediction Eq. (46) for
n 1⁄4 5/2. The theory (46) provides a reasonable agreement for the
cut-off wavelength for zero Mach number; the difference between
the theory and the numerical solution is about (15e25)%. As the
Mach number increases, the DL instability becomes stronger and
the cut-off wavelength decreases considerably. The numerical so-
lution [37] for the density ratio Q 1⁄4 7 and electron thermal con-
duction, n 1⁄4 5/2, yields the DL cut-off wavelength lc z 2.4Lc for
ffiffiffi
laser ablation (Mac 1⁄4 1=
), lc z 4.8Lc for the slow deflagration
g
(Mac 1⁄4 0) and lc z 6Lc predicted analytically (46). The cut-off
wavelength, lc z 2.4Lc,
is very small when compared to the
respective value, lc/Lf z 20, inherent to slow combustion flames.
However, the numerically obtained ablative cut-off wavelength,
lc z 2.4Lc, is extremely large in comparison with the characteristic
ablative RT instability length scales in ICF [31,51e53]. The relation
between the DL cut-off wavelength lc and the wavelength of the
fastest growing perturbations lmax in the numerical solution [37] is
also modified to lmax/lc z 1.8 for laser ablation, as compared to
lmax/lc z 2 for slow combustion flames. The fastest perturbation
wavelength lmax is of key importance to the experimental ablative
DL instability diagnostics.

4.4. Parameters required for experimental observations of the
ablative DL instability

So far no experimental evidence of the ablative DL instability
has been reported because of the specific parameters of the laser
ablation flow required for that purpose. Based on the numerical
solution [37], the ablation flow parameters may be predicted,
which provide the possibility of such experimental observations.
The most subtle issue in observing the ablative DL instability
experimentally is to distinguish it from the RT instability, since both
instabilities behave in a similar way in wrinkling the ablation front,
and they require similar diagnostics. Thus, when designing the
experiment one has to be sure that the DL instability dominates
over the RT instability, at least at the perturbation wavelengths
about lmax. An example of the respective laser radiation and target
parameters is discussed in Ref. [37] for the density ratio Q 1⁄4 6, a DT
target with initial density ra 1⁄4 0.2 g/cm3, ablation velocity
Ua 1⁄4 3.5 mm/ns, ablation front thickness La 1⁄4 0.18 mm and Spitzer
electron thermal conduction with n 1⁄4 5/2; the characteristic values
are adopted from Ref. [122]. The required laser wavelength can be
found from the relation between the critical density rc 1⁄4 ra/Q and
the laser
(4), which leads to
llaser z 0.45 mm for the specified ablation flow parameters. The
theory [79e82] yields the laser intensity Ilaser z 5$1013 W/cm2

frequency, ulaser 1⁄4 up, Eq.

needed to produce such a flow, which is an experimentally realiz-
able value [129,130]. The distance to the critical surface in such a
flow is Lc z QnLa 1⁄4 16 mm, which, by using Fig. 19, determines the
wavelength of the fastest growing DL perturbations, lmax 1⁄4 74 mm.
The respective maximum DL instability growth rate follows from
(cid:2)1, which is an order of magnitude smaller than
Fig. 18, smax 1⁄4 0.3 ns
the RT growth rate encountered in similar experimental flows, e.g.
see Ref. [90]. Still, the RT instability depends on the target accel-
eration g and on the initial target size Ltarget, since g z Pa/raLtarget,
Eq. (31), where the ablation pressure is determined by the laser
light parameters, Eq. (29). The RT instability growth rate decreases
for large targets as sRT f
; on the contrary, the DL
instability does not depend on the acceleration, which specifies the
target size required for the ablative DL instability domination.

Ref. [37] suggested a target of thickness Ltarget 1⁄4 2$103 mm, which
provides the ablative DL instability at least 5 times stronger than
the RT instability. Such a large target is unusual for ablation ex-
periments, which explains why the ablative DL instability has never
been observed so far. Taking larger targets one decreases the RT
instability strength further and makes the relative role of the DL
instability stronger.

Still, the estimates of Ref. [37] are sensitive to the expansion
factor Q and the type of thermal conduction. By using the data of
Ref. [90] for a DT target with the laser intensity Ilaser z 1014 W/cm2,
laser wavelength llaser z 0.35 mm and the thermal conduction
exponent n 1⁄4 2.1, one finds a noticeably higher density ratio Q z 40,
with the corresponding distance to the critical surface Lc 1⁄4 170 mm
and the wavelength of the fastest DL perturbations lmax 1⁄4 450 mm.
In such an experiment, to obtain smax for the DL instability about 5
times greater than
one has to use targets as large as
Ltarget 1⁄4 1.3$104 mm. For comparison, typical experiments on the RT
instability involve targets two orders of magnitude smaller,
Ltarget 1⁄4 1.9$102 mm, see Ref. [91]. Flow parameters change even
more dramatically if the radiative thermal conduction (n 1⁄4 13/2)
dominates over the electron one. Thus, in designing an experiment
on the ablative DL instability one has to elucidate first the domi-
nating thermal conduction mechanism in the plasma flow.

instability stage has not been solved yet in the context of the laser
ablation flows. Indirectly, the solution to the problem may be,
however, retrieved from the numerical simulations [136] of the
nonlinear DL instability stage for combustion flames in compress-
ible flows. Ref. [136] has considered a wide range of the flow Mach
numbers from zero (slow combustion flames) to the CJ regime of
ultimately fast deflagration propagation. Since the characteristic
length scale of the ablative DL instability is comparable to the total
distance from the ablation to the critical surface of the laser light
absorption, Lc, see Section 4.3, then the nonlinear DL instability
stage in the ICF plasma should be discussed primarily for moderate
length scales, l ~ lc. Development of the nonlinear DL instability on
large scales, l [ lc, with the possibility of the fractal flame
structure has been considered in Refs. [15e19]; discussion of the DL
fractal effects is important in the context of the thermonuclear
deflagration in Supernovae Ia [16], but it is hardly relevant to ICF.
Proper understanding of compressibility effects in the nonlinear
DL instability stage is based on results obtained for the incom-
pressible slow combustion flows. The DL instability causes an
originally planar flame front spontaneously wrinkled. On moderate
length scales, l ~ lc, the nonlinear stage may be characterized as the
development of a steady cellular structure at the front with smooth
humps facing the fuel mixture and sharp cusps pointing to the
burnt gas. A characteristic DL cell obtained in Ref. [137] for the

density ratio Q 1⁄4 8 and the channel width 4lc is shown in Fig. 21(a);
figure (b) presents a combination of several DL cells developing in a
wide channel of width 16lc. Properties of the DL cellular structures
have been well investigated for slow isobaric flames using both
simplified nonlinear models such as the Sivashinsky equation
[138e140,145] and direct numerical simulations of the complete
set of combustion equations [12,141e144]. It has been demon-
strated that a planar flame front in a hypothetical channel of suf-
ficiently large width, l > lc, with periodic boundary conditions at
the walls acquires a smooth cellular shape with the velocity of the
curved flame Uw exceeding the planar flame velocity Uf. For the 2D
geometry, the flame velocity increase depends on the channel
width l and on the density ratio Q as [138e140]

Typical dependence of the velocity increase Uw/Uf (cid:2) 1 on the
inverse channel width lc/l in the 2D case is shown in Fig. 22 as
predicted by the theory, Eq. (53) (solid line), and obtained in nu-
merical simulations [141,144],
(markers). Fig. 23 shows the
maximum velocity increase versus the density ratio Q demon-
strating good agreement between the theory and numerical sim-
ulations. In the 3D case the respective velocity increase for a curved
flame in an isobaric flow is about twice larger than in the 2D case,
Um,3D z 2Um,2D, which is practically independent of the cellular 3D
pattern at the flame front as demonstrated for the square, hexag-
onal, triangular and axisymmetric patterns [139,143,146], illus-
trated in Fig. 24. It is important to note that, according to the theory,
Eqs. (53) and (54), Refs. [138e140,145], and numerical simulations
[141e144], the cut-off wavelength lc is the only length scale for the
nonlinear DL instability. Thus, the nonlinear DL instability outcome
does not depend on the internal flamefront structure and hence on
the type of thermal conduction in the flow. For that reason, the
results of numerical simulations [136] performed for a flame with
constant thermal conduction, k 1⁄4 const, may also shed light on the
DL instability in a laser-ablation flow with k f Tn, n 1⁄4 1e6.5.

instant in Fig. 25 is chosen in such a way that the flame has almost
acquired the final stationary shape, while the flame-driven shock is
still close to the flame. As one can see in Fig. 25(b), the shock
compresses the fuel mixture from rf to r z 1.7rf; at the same time,
temperature modifications in the shock are not so strong. As a
consequence of the density change, parameters of the flame
propagating in the compressed fuel mixture are modified too,
which includes the planar flame velocity and thickness, the heating
coefficient, the DL cut-off wave number, etc. The stronger the shock,
the larger the difference between the hypothetical flame parame-
ters in the fuel mixture (prior to the shock compression) and the
actual flame parameters in the compressed gas. In particular, in-
crease of the flame velocity due to the gas compression implies
reduction of the flame thickness. Besides, the shock drives a flow in
the compressed gas, which induces the drift of the flame front
together with the shocked matter.

The leading shock travels with the speed greater than the sound
speed in the fuel mixture, and much greater than the flame velocity.
When the distance between the curved flame and the shock ex-
ceeds the tube width considerably, then the flame shape settles
down to some stationary configuration and the flame front prop-
agates at a constant velocity exceeding the planar flame speed. The
curved flame velocity depends strongly on the channel width,
especially for the hypothetic channels of moderate widths com-
parable to the cut-off wavelength lc. Fig. 26 shows dependence of
the scaled velocity of a curved stationary flame with the heating
coefficient Qb 1⁄4 6 on the inverse length scale of the cellular struc-
ture (the inverse hypothetic tube width scaled by the cut-off
wavelength for different Mach numbers of the initial planar
flame). As demonstrated in Fig. 26, the velocity dependence re-
sembles qualitatively the analytical results for the incompressible
flows shown in Fig. 22. One can clearly recognize in Fig. 26 the
“parabola pieces” like those predicted theoretically for isobaric
curved flames Eq. (53). However, two general tendencies can be
immediately identified that distinguish the compressible and
incompressible flows: (i) much larger increase of the flame velocity
in compressible flows and (ii) development of strongly curved
flames for rather narrow tubes l z lc. For stronger compressibility
effects (at higher Mach numbers), the velocity increase due to the
curved flame shape becomes noticeably larger. For the heating
coefficient Qb 1⁄4 6 the maximum scaled velocity increase for a
nearly isobaric flame Maf 1⁄4 0.01 is only Um z 0.21Uf, while for a fast
flame with Maf 1⁄4 0.17 close to the isothermal CJ regime the
maximum increase is about twice larger, Um z 0.41Uf.

The second tendency is the shift of the velocity maximum to the
region of narrow tubes. Indeed, the analytical theory for isobaric

theoretical predictions [140], Eq. (54). The markers present results of direct numerical
simulations [141e144].

5.2. The nonlinear DL instability in a compressible flow

A specific feature of

the nonlinear DL instability in a
compressible flow is a shock of considerable strength generated
due to the flame front acceleration. Although shock generation is
common for accelerating flames, still, generation of strong shock
requires powerful flame acceleration as encountered in DDT
[87e89,147]. In the context of the slow-combustion DL instability,
flame-generated shocks are typically too weak to provide notice-
able modifications of density, pressure and temperature of the fuel
mixture. Such modifications scale as fMa2 and become consider-
able only at sufficiently large values of the Mach number, Maf ≡ Uf/
cs. In particular, Fig. 25 shows a 3D representation for temperature
and density distributions for a curved DL unstable flame in a
compressible flow, calculated in Ref. [136] for Maf 1⁄4 0.17 close to the
limiting CJ value, Qb 1⁄4 6 and l 1⁄4 1.6lc at the instant t 1⁄4 2.5l/Uf after
the instability onset. It is noted that Ref. [136] employed temper-
ature ratio Qb 1⁄4 Tb/Tf as the key parameter instead of the density
ratio Q 1⁄4 rf/rb. As shown in Refs. [12], these two parameters are
related through.

curved flames predicts the velocity maximum to be achieved for
the tube width l 1⁄4 2lc, but the numerical simulations show the
maximum velocity at l 1⁄4 1.88lc for the curved flames with
Maf 1⁄4 0.01, at l 1⁄4 1.66lc for Maf 1⁄4 0.15 and at l 1⁄4 1.24lc for
Maf 1⁄4 0.17. The shift of the velocity maximum becomes especially
noticeable for fast flames with Mach numbers close to the critical
isothermal CJ regime, and may be explained by the influence of the
flame-generated shock. When the shock compresses the fuel
mixture, the planar flame properties in the compressed gas are
modified so that the new DL cut-off wavelength in the compressed
fuel mixture differs from the original cut-off wavelength in the
fresh gas used to scale the inverse tube width in Fig. 26. The shift of
the cut-off wavelength results in the shift of the velocity maximum
in Fig. 26, and is an essentially nonlinear effect, since it depends on
the shock intensity, which in turn depends on the flame velocity
increase due to the flame curvature.

The shift of the cut-off wavelength may also lead to a specific
purely nonlinear DL instability in compressible flows for narrow
channels, l < lc. The nonlinear instability implies that for narrow
channels, l < lc, all infinitesimal perturbations decay in time and
the flame is linearly stable, but perturbations of a sufficiently large,
finite, amplitude may develop into curved stationary structures. For
example, a nonlinear DL instability has been predicted theoretically

[148] and then observed in numerical simulations [142] for curved
flames in cylindrical tubes.

6.1. Bubbles and spikes at the nonlinear RT instability stage at inert
interfaces

Nonlinear development of the RT instability producing strong
interface corrugations and turbulent mixing is recently one of the
most active research areas in hydrodynamics and plasma physics
with applications ranging from ICF to supernovae and from oil in-
dustry to quantum gases [35,99e102,149]. The subject involves a
number of fundamental issues divided conventionally into the so-
called “early” and “late” stages of the instability development.
The relatively “early” nonlinear RT instability stage is characterized
by turbulent mode competition with multi-mode initial conditions
(“white noise”) at the unstable interface [150e153]. The works
focusing on the “early” RT turbulence consider typically moderate
density ratios, Q ~ 3, with the Atwood number markedly smaller
than unity, At 1⁄4 (Q (cid:2) 1)/(Q þ 1) ~ 1/2, which facilitates the sec-
ondary KH instability thus generating turbulence. The “early” RT
turbulent stage may be described in terms of a mixing zone of the
heavy and light fluids growing in size as fAt gt2. Still, so far this
“early” turbulent stage has demonstrated only minor relation to the
RT instability in the ICF, and remains mostly beyond the scope of
the present review.

A more probable scenario of the nonlinear RT instability in ICF
considers formation of single-mode bubbles of the light plasma
rising up with a stationary velocity Ub in the heavy plasma as
illustrated in Fig. 27 for the large density ratio Q [ 1. Motion of the
heavy gas in the RT-generated flow may be described as free-falling
spikes. Relative gliding of the heavy and light plasmas along the
bubble surface leads to the secondary KH instability, which gen-
erates the well-known “mushroom” structure characteristic of the
nonlinear RT instability shown in Fig. 28. The simulation of Fig. 28
has been performed specially for this review using the Pencil code

which develops eventually to a turbulent mixing layer at the late
1⁄4 19 (column 4), although the simulation has
stages, at t
started with the single-mode initial conditions. The turbulent
mixing at the late stages happens due to the secondary KH insta-
bility, which emerges at the inner side of the mushroom “cup” and
which is especially strong for comparable densities of the heavy
and light plasmas, e.g. for Q 1⁄4 2 employed in the present simula-
tions. At the same time, Fig. 28 visualizes rising of the bubble tip
with almost constant velocity in spite of the strongly non-
stationary flow in the bulk.

where U is the relative velocity of the heavy and light plasmas, then
the KH instability becomes weaker, sKH/Uk / 0, with increasing

disappear as the Atwood number approaches unity, At / 1. Ac-
counting for large values of the density ratio typical for the ICF,
Q [ 1, the mushroom structure formation and small scale tur-
bulence are not the favored scenario of the nonlinear ablative RT
instability.

Within the limit of large density ratio, Q [ 1, the stationary

Another issue of importance for the ablative RT instability in ICF
is the dynamics of spikes studied recently in Refs. [158,161,162].

spike tip is close to that imposed by free fall, the approach to free-

fall acceleration is shown in Ref. [161] to follow an inverse power
law in time. A self-similar solution has been also obtained in
Ref. [161] for the shape of the free surface at the tip of both planar
(2D) and axisymmetric spikes. Long time numerical simulations of
the RT instability at At 1⁄4 1 demonstrated that the spike's curvature
evolves as ft3, while the overshoot in acceleration shows good
(cid:2)5 law [162]. In addition, an asymptotic
agreement with the t
analysis of the spike shape at the RT unstable ablation fronts has
been performed in Ref. [158] for a strong temperature dependence
of the thermal conductivity. It has been demonstrated that the
spike shape develops a curvature singularity within a finite time,
similar in nature to the KH instability.

6.2. The nonlinear RT instability at a deflagration front

A decisive factor of the ablative RT instability evolution in ICF is
that the ablation front is not an inert interface, but propagates at a
certain intrinsic speed, thus converting a heavy plasma into a light
one. As demonstrated in Section 2, the mass flux through the RT
unstable interface renders the problem similar to a deflagration
front (flame) propagating upwards in an external gravitational
field. Still, influence of the ablation flow on the RT bubble dynamics
has remained an open issue for a long time with a number of
controversial suggestions proposed. In particular, Ref. [159] sug-
gested that the mass flux reduces the bubble velocity at the
nonlinear stage, and moderates the instability outcome similar to
the linear stage. In contrast, numerical simulations by Betti and
Sanz [122] demonstrated the bubble velocity in the ablation flow
exceeding predictions of the modified Layzer formula Eq. (58)
considerably, see Fig. 29. The simulations [122] were performed
by assigning the heat flux from the critical surface as an external
boundary condition in the hot light plasma. The decrease of the
target mass was compensated by model time-dependent gravity
acceleration in order to keep the ablation front approximately fixed
in space, which led to considerable complications in the analysis of
the results. Furthermore, the characteristic parameters of the
ablation flow were g z 110 mm/ns2, Ua z 3.5 mm/ns, La z 0.18 mm
and the perturbation wavelengths l 1⁄4 7; 10 mm, which corre-
sponded to the case of a thin unstable interface l/La [ 1 and
relatively strong gravity in comparison with the flow velocity as
measured by the inverse Froude number, Fr(cid:2)1≡gl=U2
1⁄4 65 (cid:2) 90.
a
The simulations [122] demonstrated intermediate saturation of the
RT bubble velocity to the result predicted by Eq. (58), which was
followed by additional bubble acceleration to the values exceeding
the classical predictions by a considerable factor of 1.5e1.8, see
Fig. 29. It was suggested in Ref. [122] that the numerical results
describe a new “deeply nonlinear” stage of the RT instability, with
increase of the bubble velocity related to vorticity in the light
plasma generated by the ablation flow as presented in Fig. 30.
Vorticity in the ablation flow was evaluated in Ref. [122] as ~QUak.
Recognizing the similarity between laser deflagration and slow
combustion flame one should also expect a similar “deeply
nonlinear” stage for the RT instability at a flame front propagating
upwards in a gravitational field. Still, in contrast to Ref. [122], early
modeling of the RT unstable flames did not show any sign of the
“deeply nonlinear” stage either in 2D or 3D geometries [141,142]. To
resolve the contradiction between the combustion and laser
plasma results, additional simulations of an RT unstable deflagra-
tion front with improved accuracy has been undertaken by Mod-
estov et al. [160] for the same hydrodynamic flow parameters as in
Ref. [122]. Ref. [160] has developed also the nonlinear theory of the
RT-unstable deflagration in the limit of strong acceleration
Fr(cid:2)1≡gl=U2
[1. The theory [160] reveals an important difference
a
between the classical RT bubbles with inert interface and the
nonlinear RT instability at the deflagration front, which originates

in the light plasma motion inside the bubble. It is noted that Eq.
(58) extending the Layzer theory to finite Q was derived under the
assumption of zero plasma velocity in the bubble [12]. In contrast,
requires
momentum conservation at
continuous tangential velocity at the front irrespective if this front
is represented by combustion flame or laser ablation [9e12]. Then
heavy plasma gliding along the bubble surface e a curved defla-
gration front e generates a similar motion of the light ablated
plasma at the other side of the surface and hence creates a vortical
flow inside the bubble. The effect of vorticity production at a curved
flame front is well-known in combustion science [2,9e12] and
provides a straightforward effective methodology for studies of the
ablative nonlinear RT instability. The tangential momentum con-
servation and vorticity generation lead to two important effects in
laser ablation: First, since plasma velocity is the same at both sides
of the bubble surface, then the secondary KH instability is reduced
and the mushroom structure is unlikely to develop, as already

the light plasma increases the stationary bubble velocity from Eq.
(58) back to Eq. (57) in spite of the finite density ratio Q, recog-
nizing that the classical Layzer result Eq. (57) has been obtained for
Q [ 1. For the simulation parameters of [122], with Q 1⁄4 6, the
difference between Eqs. (57) and (58) is about 10%, which is not
large but noticeable. Theory [160] has also predicted the charac-

similarity between the results of Ref. [160], Fig. 31, and Ref. [122],

deflagration front for Q 1⁄4 5, 6 and l/Lf 1⁄4 20e27 obtained in
Ref. [160]; the earlier results of Refs. [122,141] are presented for
comparison. The numerical results are also compared to the Layzer
formula, Eq. (57), which, in spite of the classical form, now takes
into account of both the decrease of the bubble speed due to the
finite density ratio Q 1⁄4 5, 6 and the speed increase due to vorticity
production in the light gas. These two effects compensate each
other as derived theoretically [160].

The numerical results demonstrate noticeably larger velocity of

theory, especially at low values of the gravitational acceleration.

data of Ref. [160]. Still, the difference is minor and may be attrib-
uted to complications of the numerical modeling of Ref. [122] and
to difficulties in the data analysis due to the time-dependent
gravity acceleration employed in Ref. [122]. Thus, the suggestion
of a new “deeply nonlinear” stage in the ablation RT instability is
not supported by numerical modeling of the RT unstable defla-
gration [160]. Instead, increase of the ablation bubble velocity in
comparison with the classical formula is related mainly to the
deflagration (combustion) effects of intrinsic front propagation and
the DL instability.

Numerical modeling [160] has also demonstrated good agree-
ment of the theoretical prediction Eq. (58) for the vorticity gener-
ated in the light plasma with the numerical results as shown in
Fig. 33. Strong vorticity dependence on the gravitational field is
noted, as demonstrated by both numerical results and theory [160],
Eq. (58). On the contrary, Ref. [122] suggested vorticity indepen-
dent of gravity, u ~ QUak, which contradicts the simulation results
[160].

merical modeling.

The problem of vorticity production by the RT instability
assumed primary importance in view of the recent experimental
results on spontaneous generation of ultra-high magnetic fields in
ICF [54e60]. The basic idea of the coupling between vorticity and
the magnetic field follows from similarity of the respective equa-
tions for the magnetic field B in a resistive plasma and vorticity u!
in a viscous flow [1,163e165]

shows increase of the peak magnetic field in the flow as a func-
tion of the spike position scaled by the transverse channel width, h/

generated magnetic field climbs to B ~ 103 T at the late instability
stages. Other plots in Fig. 35 indicate possible modifications of the
magnetic field for varying density, acceleration, wavelength,
Atwood number and ion mass, which reproduce the key tendencies
of Eq. (64).

The simulations [167e170] support the basic theoretical idea of
the magnetic field generation through vorticity production in the
RT unstable flow. Still, numerical modeling performed so far
considered only the case of inert plasmas with no mass flux
through the unstable interface, which, as discussed above, is too
distinct from the ablative RT instability. Because of the considerable
simplifications, it is too early to state that the simulations repro-
duce properly the effect of ultra-high magnetic field generation in
ICF e the main numerical work remains a challenge for future
research.

With the target acceleration g z 110 mm/ns2, the perturbation
wavelengths l1⁄410 mm, adopted from Refs. [122], and the DT plasma
parameters Mp, Z, the RT generated magnetic field strength is
evaluated by Eq. (65) as B ~ 100 T, i.e. ~1 MG. Since the magnetic
field strength scales as Bf
, further increase of the magnetic
field is possible for increasing target acceleration g (e.g. by
increasing the ablation pressure or decreasing the target size, Eq.
(31)) or by decreasing the perturbation wavelength l. The effect of
magnetic field generation by the RT instability in ICF has been
predicted theoretically long ago, with characteristic estimates for
the magnetic field strength up to 1 MG [163e165]. In contrast to the
theoretical predictions, early RT experiments reported much
smaller fields, of the order of 1 kG [166]. Only recently, the ultra-
high magnetic fields have been finally detected in experiments on
ICF implosions, increasing to (0.6e1) MG [54e60]; the RT insta-
bility has been pointed out as a presumable source of the magnetic
fields. Similar values for the RT-generated magnetic field have been
obtained in numerical simulations [167e170].

As an example of such modeling, Figs. 34 and 35 demonstrate
generation of both vorticity and magnetic field by the RT instability
in inert plasmas obtained numerically by Srinivasan and Tang [168]
for the nominal case imitating deuterium fuel near ignition, with

The problem of ultra-high magnetic field generation in ICF
invoked also the interest in another fundamental hydrodynamic
instability e the KH instability [171e175]. The KH instability is one
of the most powerful phenomena in fluid mechanics and plasma
physics, which develops at the interface between two fluids gliding
along each other and generates turbulence via cascades of inter-
acting vortices. Various examples of the KH instability may be
encountered in geophysical and astrophysical flows, from ocean
surface waves excited by wind, turbulent jets and wakes, up to
large-scales instabilities in the interstellar medium, accretion discs
and supernova remnants. Initially, interest in the KH instability in
ICF has been fueled by the RT instability research. The well-known
RT mushroom structure of the RT bubbles shown in Fig. 28 is the
outcome of the secondary KH instability at the bubble interface
arising from the relative motion of the light and heavy plasmas. In
ICF, the secondary KH instability may be treated as the main source
of vorticity, turbulence and hence the magnetic field [167e170].

Lately, experiments have been designed and performed on the
Omega Laser Facility initiating the KH instability at
the
foamealuminum interface in a layered target with two different
substances set in motion by counter-propagating shock waves
[175]. The other suggestion was to induce the KH instability by a
shock refracted at an interface separating two substances of
noticeably different density [172,173,176]. These experiments
demonstrated the conceptual design [171] that relied upon shock
driven baroclinic vorticity generation and produced high quality
radiographic data as shown in Fig. 36. The basic configuration of the
experimental setup [172,173,176] consisted of a stack of opaque
high density plastic and low density foam contained in a shock tube
of rectangular cross-section (see Ref. [172] for details). Laser energy
of about 4 kJ in a 1 ns pulse was delivered to an ablator covering the
low density foam part of the target, thus launching a strong shock
into the low density foam. The pressure gradient at the leading
edge of the shock was essentially at right angles to the density
gradient at the interface of the two dissimilar materials thus
maximizing the baroclinic term VP (cid:6) Vr. The interface between the
two materials was perturbed by a sinusoidal contour with ampli-
tude (a 1⁄4 30 mm) and wavelength (l 1⁄4 400 mm) chosen such that a

number of large vortices develop nonlinear structure in the ex-
pected field of view during the experiment. The experimental data
vividly showed the complete evolution of distinct eddies of a size
comparable to the initial perturbation wavelength (~400 mm), from
vortex formation to apparent turbulent break-up in the span of
about 75 ns shown in Fig. 36 (left). The gross timing, size, and shape
of the vortex structures agreed with preshot simulations, Fig. 36
(right). In Fig. 37 a comparison of the experimental vortex height
data is shown against the simulation results and theory [171]. At

late-time, the simulation and the stretched vortex model (which
uses simulation derived values) both over-predict the experimental
data. The simulation does exhibit the same change in growth rate at
around t 1⁄4 38 ns that the experiments show, which was related in
Ref. [176] to the vortex size compression by the reflected shocks
and the 2D simulation geometry as compared to 3D experiments. In
order to resolve the discrepancy, 3D simulations of the shock driven
KH instability have been performed in Ref. [174], see Fig. 38, and
demonstrated better agreement with the experiments.

Unfortunately, so far the Omega Facility experiments on the
laser-driven KH instability have been performed without direct
measurements of the instability-generated magnetic field; the
respective numerical simulations did not consider the possibility of
the magnetic field generation either. Another specific feature of the
experiments and modeling was minor interaction of the KH-
generated vortices due to strong density difference between the
plastic and the foam. The strongly nonlinear vortices observed
[172,173,176] had the same characteristic wavelength as the initial

coalesce until a single vortex is formed of the largest possible size
allowed by the system geometry [177,178], see Fig. 39. At suffi-
ciently high values of the Reynolds number, the KH vortices may
exhibit a fractal structure with, e.g., four steps in the fractal cascade
demonstrated in the numerical simulations [177]. Generation and
evolution of the magnetic field arising from the KH instability due
to the baroclinic term VP (cid:6) Vr has been investigated in Ref. [178] by
direct numerical magnetohydrodynamic simulations for the com-
mon geometry of two counter-propagating plasma flows of close
density. In contrast to the numerical RT instability studies of
magnetic field generation [167e170], the KH generated magnetic
field may yield complex structures influenced strongly by different
initial conditions for the vorticity and the magnetic field. Simula-
tions [178] show that the magnetic field continues to grow even
after the hydrodynamic vortex has been developed and started
decaying due to non-zero flow viscosity. The results obtained
demonstrate that the relation between vorticity and magnetic field
in the MHD instabilities is not as straightforward as it was believed
previously, and indicate extensive prospects for future research,
including
numerical
approaches.

This review has presented aspects of the phenomena arising in
ICF that are of a similar nature as those in combustion systems, and
demonstrated the importance of applying the ideas and methods of
combustion science to facilitate their understanding. In some ICF
problems it took decades of active research with little progress until
the clue to the solution came from combustion studies. As one of

simulation (blue diamonds), and theory [171] (purple asterisks and green triangles).
The data and simulation both show a period of post-shock amplitude compression
between 10e15 ns and subsequent amplitude growth. A distinct change in growth-rate
is seen around 38 ns. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure

the most illustrative examples of such synergy effect, the problem
of ablative stabilization of the RT instability can be pointed out as
demonstrated in Section 3 of the present review.

Section 2 reveals the strong physical similarity of the basic
properties of the slow combustion front e flame e and the front of
laser ablation, which develops when a capsule of the thermonu-
clear target is irradiated by high-power lasers, ion beams or soft X-
rays. Both flame and laser ablation belong to the same hydrody-
namic class of deflagration wave propagation due to energy release
and heat transfer. At the same time, one finds a number of
distinctive features of the laser deflagration in ICF, which place it in
a special position of an ultra-fast CJ deflagration propagating with
the maximum possible speed for this class with isothermal sonic
condition attained at the hot side of the front. Another special
feature of the laser deflagration is the strong temperature depen-
dence of the thermal conduction coefficient according to electron

or radiation heat transfer mechanisms. Because of the temperature
dependence, one obtains dramatic difference in the length scales
between the cold plasma (at the ablation surface) and the hot
plasma (at the critical surface of the laser light absorption).

Section 3 reviews research results on the linear stage of the RT
instability in laser plasma; one of the effects of primary importance
in this problem is stabilization of the RT instability at short wave-
length due to the ablation flow.
It is demonstrated that the
discontinuity model does not provide a self-consistent solution to
the problem because of the inevitable deficit in the boundary
conditions at the subsonic discontinuous surface with mass flux. By
employing combustion methods of the DL instability theory, it was
shown that the ablative RT instability is not stabilized within the
discontinuity model. Instead, in this approach, the RT instability is
accompanied by the DL instability of a deflagration front, which
makes the flow even more unstable. In contrast to that, the self-

consistent solution to the problem of the ablative RT stabilization
has been obtained taking into account of the finite thickness and
continuous structure of the ablation front.

Section 4 demonstrated the theoretical possibility of the DL
instability in the laser ablation flow and discussed its main char-
acteristics as compared to the classical DL instability of a usual
slow combustion front. The difference between the two cases is
due to the specific features of laser ablation: sonic velocities of the
hot plasma at the critical surface and strong temperature depen-
dence of thermal conduction.
It is demonstrated that the DL
instability in laser ablation is much stronger than in the classical
case. In particular, the maximum growth rate for laser ablation is
about three times larger as compared to slow combustion flames.
The characteristic length scale of the DL instability in the laser
ablation flow is comparable to the total distance from the ablation
to the critical surface, hence thick targets are required for exper-
imental observations of the ablative DL instability. For sufficiently
thick targets the DL instability dominates over the ablative RT
instability, which demonstrates
the same multidimensional
behavior and requires similar experimental diagnostics for both
phenomena, see Section 4.4. At the nonlinear stage, as reviewed in
Section 5, the DL instability demonstrates also a much stronger
velocity increase in the laser ablation flow as compared to slow
combustion, because of considerable plasma compressibility at the
critical surface.

The nonlinear stage of the RT instability in ICF is characterized
by development of the bubble-spike structure at the deflagration
front. In Section 6, results on the dynamics of ablative RT bubbles
are compared to the classical Layzer theory and to the RT instability
developing at upward propagating slow combustion flames. The
comparison clarifies the issue of the “deeply nonlinear stage” in the
RT instability development, as well as vorticity production in hot
plasma behind the unstable laser deflagration front. The vorticity
production effect in the RT flows is believed to be responsible for
the generation of the ultra-high magnetic fields with strength up to
1 MG observed recently in the ICF experiments at the OMEGA laser
facility. As shown in the review, proper understanding of the
magnetic field generation requires also methods and ideas of
combustion science. This problem is not properly solved yet and
remains a challenge for the future interdisciplinary research of
combustion and ICF plasma science.

When the present review was in the process of final editing,
results were reported of the energy gain in ICF experiments
exceeding the energy input [78]. Such impressive progress in
igniting thermonuclear reactions in the DT targets opens new
prospects for synergetic collaboration of combustion and ICF
plasma science on the subjects of thermonuclear reactions ignition,
kinetics, front spreading, deflagration-to-detonation transition and
many others, which are currently waiting to be explored.
