Direct absorption solar collectors (DASCs) based on nanofluids offer a promising solution for achieving the dual
goals  of  solar  energy  utilization:  maximizing  solar  absorption  and  minimizing  thermal  losses.  In  contrast  to
conventional  surface  absorption  solar  collectors,  which  suffer  from  substantial  heat  losses,  DASCs  operate  by
replacing elevated-temperature absorption surfaces with nanofluid bulk for volumetric absorption. To bridge the
gap between theoretical research and commercialization, a comprehensive understanding of DASCs is essential.
This includes modeling approaches, the impact of design and operational parameters, recognizing limitations,
and  evaluating  future  prospects.  This  study  provides  a  comprehensive  review  with  a  focus  on  resolving  dis-
agreements regarding low-flux DASC responses to specific design and operational variations that have sparked
conflicting  interpretations  in  the  literature.  This  review,  by  addressing  these  discrepancies,  serves  as  an
invaluable resource for researchers seeking a more nuanced understanding of this evolving field, facilitating its
advancement into practical applications.

This review comprehensively examines the field of DASCs across eight distinct sections. Section 1 provides an
overview of solar energy’s potential, the evolution of solar collectors, and the rationale for the review. Section 2
focuses  on  theoretical  modeling  approaches  for  simulating  colloidal  suspensions  in  solar  thermal  systems,
including optical properties, radiative transport, and heat transfer mechanisms. The strengths and limitations of
these models are critically evaluated to assist researchers in selecting the most suitable one for specific colloidal
systems. Additionally, a critical assessment of analytical and numerical studies in the existing literature is pre-
sented in this section. Section 3 offers a detailed view and critical assessment of experimental efforts in the field.
The  stability  of  nanofluids  is  discussed  in  section  4,  while  sections  5  and  6  analyze  the  impact  of  operating
conditions, geometry, design parameters, and flow properties on DASC performance criteria. We address con-
tradictions and ambiguities in the effects of some operating variables in the DASC literature, considering state-of-
the-art  simulation  techniques.  Section  7  focuses  on  economic  and  environmental  analyses  related  to  DASCs,
providing  insights  into  their feasibility  and  sustainability. Finally,  Section  8  synthesizes conclusions  from  the
reviewed literature, identifies research gaps, and proposes future directions based on recent advancements in
DASC technology.

1. Introduction

The  continuously  increasing  demand  on  energy,  due  to  the  rapid
population and civilization growth, is accompanied by environmental
concerns  because of the problematic  dependence on conventional en-
ergy resources such as the fossil fuel that contributes the biggest portion
of the world energy. Climate change and depletion of conventional en-
ergy  resources  concerns  have  pushed  the  scientific  community  to
transmit  the  world  from  dependence  on  conventional  resources  to
dependence  on  alternative  green  and  sustainable  ones  such  as  solar
energy. Many aspects have made solar energy one of the most promising

alternative energy resources and thus the focus of researchers’ attention
for the past few decades.

1.1. Why solar energy?

Solar energy is renewable, free, abundant, clean with nearly zero-
emission  conversion  processes,  and  available  for  appropriate  periods
in most of the world countries [1]. It offers considerable amounts of safe
energy  for  different  small  and  large  energy  applications  reliably,
affordably, and practically [2]. Solar incidence on the Earth’s surface in
1 h is greater than the whole energy consumed by humans in one year,
and  the  incidence  in  one  year  (∼ 3, 400, 000  EJ)  is  more  than  7500
times  the  whole  primary  energy  consumed  during  the  same  interval
(∼ 450  EJ)  [3].  Aforementioned  advantages  explain  why  the  depen-
dence on solar energy increases at an accelerated pace with an annual
growth  of  around  8.3  %  [4].  Solar  energy  is  expected  to  be  the
fastest-growing  power  production  resource  within
the  period
2012–2040  [4]  reaching  to  the  greatest  share  of  universal  electricity
production in 2050 [5]. Moreover, it is planned that it accounts for more
than two thirds of the universal energy consumption by 2100 [5,6,7].
The remarkable attention paid to solar energy is also attributed to the
continuous declination in solar systems’  costs that lower the prices of
electricity production, in high solar-incidence countries like the UAE in
2018,  to  $0.024/kWh,  i.e.,  less  than  the  electricity  produced  by  con-
ventional methods [8].

Solar energy can be converted into  three different forms  of useful
energy: chemical energy through the photosynthesis process as in plants;
thermal  energy  through  a  photo-thermal  conversion  process  via  solar
thermal  systems;  and  electricity  through  a  photoelectric  conversion
process via  photovoltaic (PV) cells [9].  For electric power generation
purposes, PV cells have a privilege over other techniques as they directly
convert  the  incident  solar  radiation  within  the  ultraviolet–visible
(UV-VIS) spectrum into electric power [10], which significantly lowers
the  electricity  prices.  On  the  other  hand,  solar  thermal  systems  can
convert  solar  radiation  in  the  entire  spectrum  into  thermal  energy
through a photothermal conversion process [11] and deliver it via a heat
exchanger  to  a  working  fluid  like  water,  oil,  air,  ..etc.  Then,  thermal
energy  can  be  employed  for  household  use,  thermal  applications  like
HVAC, or  industrial processes.  Alternatively, it can be converted into
electricity via a power cycle which requires a concentrated solar power
(CSP)
the
photovoltaic-thermal  (PV-T)  technology,  combines  the  two  virtues  of
photoelectric and  photothermal  conversions  in one  system  and  yields
highly efficient solar systems, as reviewed by Herrando et al. [13]. Based
on the synergistic effect, such a hybrid system obtains a higher overall
efficiency  than  a  PV  or  a  solar  thermal  system  alone.  However,  in
comparison  with  the  photoelectric  conversion, the  photothermal  con-
version is an efficient, straightforward, and less complex strategy for the
solar energy utilization [14].  Besides, solar thermal technologies  pro-
vide energy for several thermal applications that account for a consid-
erable  portion  of  the  universal  demand,  even  including  water
desalination  [15].  This  justifies  the  significant  increase  in  the
solar-to-thermal applications scale and the considerable attention paid
to photothermal conversion systems to become the most common solar
energy utilization form [16].

1.2. Solar thermal collectors

Solar collectors harvest solar radiation, convert it into thermal en-
ergy,  and convey it  to a working  fluid. Depending on their operating
temperature,  solar  collectors  are  categorized  into  three  groups:  low

temperature  collectors  (up  to  100
C),  medium  (between  100
C  and

◦
400
C) [17]. Each category applies a different

technology and working fluid. Water represents a reasonable choice for
operating temperatures up to 90
C, oils, glycols and glycerol for tem-
peratures between 90 and 175
C, and molten salts or gases for higher

temperatures  [18].  A  further  classification  of  solar  collectors  can  be
found in the literature [19]: non-concentrating (stationary) collectors in
which absorption of direct solar flux is performed by an absorbing sheet
or volume (such as flat plate solar collectors (FPC) [20] and evacuated
tube solar collectors (ETC) [21]), and concentrating collectors in which
reflecting mirrors are employed to collect and focus the incident sunlight
onto a smaller area where sun tracking systems are needed for efficient
collection and concentration (such as parabolic trough collector (PTC)
[22],  linear  Fresnel  collector  (LFC)  [23],  parabolic  dish  concentrator
(PDC) [24], and solar tower with a heliostat field [25]). Moreover, the
collector  geometry  plays  a  main  role  in  the  temperature  that  can  be
reached. For instance, FPCs and ETCs attain relatively low temperatures,
PTCs  attain  medium  temperatures,  and  central  towers  and  PDCs  can
attain elevated ones [26].

Academic investigations of solar collectors involve efforts to attain
maximum  solar  absorption  and  minimum  heat  losses,  thereby  maxi-
mizing  the  useful  energy  acquired  by  the  working  fluid  and  thus  the
photothermal conversion efficiency (ηPC). ηPC can be defined as the ratio
of  useful  thermal  energy gained  by  the  working  fluid  to  solar  energy
input [27]:

ηPC

=

 ̇mcp(Tout (cid:0) Tin)

(1)

where   ̇m,  cp,  Tin,  and  Tout  are  the  mass  flow  rate,  specific  heat,  inlet
temperature, and outlet temperature of the working fluid, respectively.
Gs  and A are the irradiation (solar radiative heat flux per unit area) and
area of the solar collector, respectively. These objectives represent the
essence of solar thermal technology enhancements either for surface or
volumetric absorption technologies as being discussed later.

1.2.1. Conventional surface absorption solar collector

In such systems, incident radiation is absorbed by an outer surface
coated  with  a  highly  absorptive  material  designed  for  the  solar  spec-
trum, such as a conductive metal sheet painted with TiNOx, where it is
then converted into thermal energy. Thereafter, it is transferred to the
working fluid flowing behind the sheet by conduction and convection.
However,  the  collector  absorption  surface  (absorber)  undergoes
elevated temperatures creating a great temperature difference with the
surroundings leading to severe losses and thus degradation in ηPC. The
declination of ηPC  with very high absorber temperatures is attributed to
the relatively-high emissive losses occurring by virtue of the thermal re-
radiation’s fourth-order dependence on the absorber temperature [28].
As  shown  above,  conventional  surface  absorption  solar  collectors
(SASCs)  suffer  from  high  amounts  of  heat  losses  by  conduction,  con-
vection,  and radiation  that increase with temperature [29],  and from
thermal resistances through the conductive and convective heat transfer
between  the  absorber  and  working  fluid.  These  limitations  drove  the
research community to seek different solar energy harvesting techniques
with mitigated losses.

1.2.2. Volumetric absorption collectors

Toward  suppressing  the  thermal  losses  from  which  conventional
SASCs  suffer,  Minardi  and  Chuang  [30],  in  an  experimental  work  in
1974,  proposed  a  novel  solar  collector  called  Direct  Absorption  Solar
Collector  (DASC).  The  researchers  utilized  highly  absorbent  “black”
liquids (liquids blended with India ink) flowing in transparent channels
to  directly  absorb  solar  radiation  without  the  need  to  heat  any  other
parts  in  the  system.  In  addition,  the  absence  of  a  metallic  absorber
eliminates  the  corrosion  issues  that  threaten  SASCs.  Also,  authors
observed  that  the  new  collector  significantly  lowers  thermal  losses.
Unlike SASC where heat is absorbed on the top surface, DASC offers a
distinct  advantage.  In  DASC,  the  working  fluid  directly  absorbs  solar
energy throughout its volume. This leads to a more even distribution of
heat within the fluid, rather than concentrating it at the top surface. In
simpler  terms,  with  DASC,  the  hottest  parts  are,  in  theory,  spread

conv and qʹʹ

throughout the working fluid, instead of being localized at the top like in
SASC. Fig. 1 shows the thermal resistance (R) network in the (a) SASC
and  (b)  DASC,  and  elucidates  how  direct  volumetric  absorption  in
DASCs  mitigates  the  severe  convective  and  radiative  thermal  losses
(qʹʹ
rad, respectively) since the DASC’s upper surface temperature
is  less  than  that  of  the  absorber  plate  placed  at  the  top  of  the  SASC
system. Also, it shows that the conductive and convective thermal re-
sistances (Rcond  and  Rconv, respectively)  between the  absorber and the
working fluid no longer exist in the DASC system due to the absence of
an  absorber  [31].  This,  in  theory,  results  in  a  more  homogeneous
working fluid temperature field in the DASC [32] and thus lower losses
and higher ηPC  [33]. However, the radiative absorption thermal resis-
tance (Rabs) influences both systems.

Introducing  “black”  liquids  in  the  photothermal  conversion  tech-
nology  as  an  absorbing  medium  opened  up  new  research  paths  to
improve  solar  thermal  systems.  The  ηPC  of  the  volumetric  absorption
collector is governed by the working fluid absorption ability which is
poor for most typical thermal fluids [34]. For instance, more than 50 %
of  the  incident  radiation  was  transmitted  through  a  water-ethylene
glycol  mixture  when  used  as  a  working  fluid  in  a  volumetric  absorp-
tion solar collector with a depth of 5/16 in [30]. As a solution, it was
proposed to enhance the technology by changing the absorbing medium
from a conventional purely fluidic medium to a particle-laden fluid. The
effect of microparticles in different heat transfer applications was first
discussed  by  Hunt  [35].  Suspended  microparticles  were  found  very
useful in photothermal conversion technologies where the suspension of
proper micron-sized particles in the working fluid enhances the working
fluid absorption ability [34]. Abdelrahman et al. [34] attributed that to
the unique absorption properties of microparticles. However, despite the
enhancement witnessed in the volumetric absorption collector perfor-
mance by virtue of adding micron-sized particles, some issues emerged
in the system, such as fouling of pipes and clogging of pumps and valves
due  to  particle  clustering  and  agglomeration  in  the  working  fluid.
Studies  have  indicated  that  such  phenomena  cause  the  absorption
spectra to be governed by the bulk fluid medium rather than dispersed
particles [30,34].

1.2.3. Nanofluid-based direct absorption solar collectors

Nanotechnology has revealed superior physical and chemical nano-
materials’  attributes  that  are  distinctive  from  their  bulk  counterparts
[36].  As  a  result,  the  proposition  emerged  to  decrease  the  particles
initially  sized  at  the  microscale  to  the  nanoscale  range.  This  trans-
formation has led to the development of novel working fluids known as

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience103(2024)1011603

A. Hasan et al.

"nanofluids". Nanofluids, also referred to as nanodispersions and nano-
colloids, are colloidal suspensions of engineered nanoparticles, with at
least  one  dimension  of  the  nanoparticles  falling  within  the  range  of
1–100 nm. The synthesis of nanofluids was initially achieved by Masuda
et al. [37], with the term ’nanofluid’ coined by Choi and Eastman [38].
Nanoparticles offer a significant advantage over micro-size particles
in  conventional  piping  and  pumping  systems  due  to  their  minimal
clogging  potential.  Additionally,  they  pose  fewer  risks  of  erosion  or
instability. Furthermore, nanoparticles can dramatically alter the optical
and thermophysical properties (OTPs) of the working fluid [34,39,40].
An  additional  advantage  of  nanofluids  emerges  when  using  metallic
nanoparticles  that  might  be  smaller  than  the  mean  free  path  of  the
conduction electrons in their bulk metallic material, which induces the
Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance (LSPR) phenomenon. LSPR is an
optical phenomenon that occurs when light interacts with conductive
nanoparticles that are smaller than the incident wavelength. In LSPR,
the  electric  field  of  incident  light  collectively  excites  electrons  in  the
conduction band of the nanoparticles. This resonant interaction leads to
coherent  localized  plasmon  oscillations,  and  the  resonant  frequency
strongly  depends  on  the  nanoparticle  composition,  size,  geometry,
dielectric environment, and separation distance. The electrons oscilla-
tion causes the surface plasmon to be excited due to the resonant transfer
of energy from the incident photon to the plasmon yielding a significant
increase in the radiative energy absorption [41]. Thus, the spectrum of
light that can be absorbed is expanded while keeping a distinguished
absorption peak, which opens the door for further improvement in the
solar  radiation  absorption  efficiency  [42].  Therefore,  it  can  be  stated
that nanofluid-based collectors outperform conventional ones under the
same working conditions [43]. Employing nanofluids in DASCs repre-
sented  a  breakthrough  in  the  volumetric  absorption  technology  and
announced the launch of nanofluid-based DASC research field. There-
after, huge experimental, analytical, and numerical research efforts have
been  put  to  investigate  the  nanofluid-based  DASC  performance  at
different  operating  variables,  determine  their  optimum  values,  and
propose enhancement techniques.

The  key  differences  between  the  conventional  collector  and
nanofluid-based DASC can be observed in Fig. 2. It can be seen that solar
radiation is absorbed by an absorbing surface in the conventional col-
lector and then energy is delivered to the working fluid running inside
the channel by conduction and convection. A vacuum chamber between
the absorbing surface and outer glass is placed to eliminate conductive
and convective losses to surroundings. However, this does not prevent
the severe re-radiative losses due to the absorbing surface’s high tem-
perature. On the other hand, radiation is directly absorbed by the bulk
volume of the nanofluid working in the DASC, which keeps the system
from surface hot spots that boost severe re-radiative losses. Also, this
reduces the conductive and convective losses to surroundings because,
in theory, the temperature peak exists within the working nanofluid in
the  middle  of  the  collector  rather  than  on  an  external  surface  as  in
conventional solar collectors [44,45]. In addition, volumetric solar ab-
sorption  eliminates  the  conductive  and  convective  resistances  (see
Fig. 1b), that conventional SASCs experience (see Fig. 1a), due to the
absence  of  heat  transfer  processes  from  an  absorbing  sheet  to  the

working fluid.

Early pioneer numerical [46,47] and experimental [48] efforts were
reported  in  the  literature  to  analyze  nanofluid-based  DASCs.  In-
vestigations affirmed that the presence of such ultra-small particles in
the  working  fluid  enhances  the  scattering  and  absorption  of  incident
radiation  (i.e.,  enhances  the  light  extinction)  and,  consequently,  ηPC
[49].  Researchers  realized  that  optical  characteristics  of  nanofluids
should be sufficiently strong to be capable of capturing solar radiation,
and their radiative behavior should be clearly understood for a proper
design  of  the  nanofluid-based  DASC  systems  [49].  Systematic  in-
vestigations  of  complex  physics-based  models  to  study  the  radiative
behavior of nanofluids can be found in the literature [50,51], and will be
thoroughly  addressed  in  section  2.1.  Besides  the  radiative  properties,
many pieces of research showed that the presence of nanoparticles en-
hances  the  thermophysical  properties  of  the  working  fluid  such  as
thermal [52–54] and mass [55] diffusivities. Phelan et al. [56] reviewed
the early research works and discussed nanofluids prospect in several
heat  transfer  applications.  Benefiting  from attempts  discussed  earlier,
Tyagi  et  al.  [57]  laid  the  groundwork  for  numerically  modeling
nanofluid-based  DASCs  by  presenting  and  solving  a  2D  heat  transfer
model  (coupled  energy  balance  and  radiative  transport  equations)  to
predict the ηPC  of a nanofluid-based DASC including the medium scat-
tering and absorption impacts for comparison with a conventional SASC.
Authors found that the absorption ability of an Al/water nanofluid is
nine times higher than that of pure water. Additionally, they stated that
nanofluid-based DASC showed a 10 % higher ηPC  than a typical SASC
under the same conditions. It is evident that the 10 % increase in ηPC  is
considered slight compared to the ninefold increase in the absorption
ability of the working fluid. This discrepancy can be attributed to the
heightened thermal losses, which occur alongside the temperature gain
in the DASC. Further elaboration on this topic can be found in sections
5.1, 5.5, and 6.2.

After  Tyagi  et  al.  [57]  had  introduced  a  numerical  model  for  a
nanofluid-based  DASC  system,  it  was  immediately  followed  by  an
experimental  research  work  conducted  by  the  same  research  group,
Otanicar et al. [34]. The authors verified the benefits of using nanofluids
in DASCs and their potential for improvement by adjusting operational
parameters to achieve optimal volumetric light absorption. Thereafter,
the  field  has  witnessed  very  fast  growth.  A  huge  number  of  research
papers  tackled  the  DASC  system  from  many  different  viewpoints  and
compared nanofluid-enhanced DASCs with conventional systems using
different approaches. For instances, Luo et al. [58] experimentally and
numerically
collector  with  a
nanofluid-based DASC and found that increments of up to 25 % and 100
K in DASC photothermal conversion efficiency and outlet temperature
gain, respectively, can be obtained by utilizing nanofluids instead of a
pure fluid. Another comparison by Delfani et al. [59] showed 10–29 %
enhancement  in  DASC  performance  when  using  nanofluids.  Similar
observations  were  demonstrated  by  Refs.  [34,60].  Vakili  et  al.  [61]
experimentally  confirmed
that  using  graphene/deionized-water
(DI-water) nanofluid in DASC enhanced the collector ηPC  by up to 33
% due to improving the extinction coefficient (Ke) of the working fluid.
The extinction coefficient is an intrinsic property of the material that

compared  a  pure-fluid-based

determines how strongly it reflects or absorbs light at a certain wave-
length. Also, Gupta et al. [62] could obtain an improvement of 39.6 % in
ηPC  of  a  DASC  under  certain  operating  conditions  of  Al2O3/water
nanofluid mass flow rate (  ̇m) and volume fraction (fV). fV  is the ratio of
the volume of dispersed nanoparticles to the base fluid volume. More-
over,  Gorji  and  Ranjbar  [63]  experimentally  and  numerically  investi-
gated  a  DASC  employing  three  nanofluids  with  DI-water  host  (base)
fluid and graphite, magnetite, and silver nanoparticles. They obtained
an enhancement of up to 57 % and 20 % in energetic and exergetic ef-
ficiencies, respectively.

1.3. The need for a review paper in the field of nanofluid-based DASC
systems

Numerous  authors  have  either  reviewed  nanofluid-based  DASCs
specifically or incorporated them into their broader reviews on nano-
fluid  applications  in  solar  systems.  Some  of  these  reviews  [64–66]
focused  on  recent  advances  in  nanofluid-based  solar  collectors,
including  FPCs,  ETCs,  DASCs,  and  PV-Ts,  addressing  the  physical
mechanisms, forces affecting the heat transfer in nanofluid flows and the
thermophysical properties, heat transfer models, and evaluation criteria
of  nanofluid,  and  compared  them  with  ones  employing  conventional
working fluids. Also, they underscored the importance of integrating the
utilization of nanofluids and turbulence generators within solar collec-
tors to enhance the photothermal conversion efficiency and maximize
the extraction of useable solar energy. However, it has been observed
that the DASC system was mentioned as an exemplar among solar col-
lectors  employing  nanofluids  without  delving  comprehensively  into
deep discussions concerning researchers seeking an exhaustive under-
standing of the in-depth knowledge of DASC matters specifically. The
current review expands on the investigation of DASCs and proposes a
roadmap  for  developing  a  reliable  DASC  with  optimal  performance
under  realistic  conditions.  Such  a  roadmap  is  urgently  needed  when
transmitting the technology from labs to the real world.

Recent developments in the field of nanofluids used in DASCs have
been reviewed, focusing on preparation techniques, optical behaviors,
solar thermal energy conversion performance, and physical and thermal
stability  [9].  The  article  is  structured  around  key  aspects  such  as  the
effects of nanoparticle material types on DASC performance, as well as
the  stability  and  optical  characterization  of  nanofluids.  Additionally,
state-of-the-art  solar  heat  installations  for  industrial  processes  and
conventional SASCs were reviewed, along with a comprehensive sum-
mary of studies addressing concentrating and non-concentrating DASCs
[32].

Previous reviews have only superficially addressed the development
of modeling techniques and their limitations, resulting in inconsistencies
in  the  behavior  of  DASCs  under  various  operating  parameters,  as
documented in the literature. There is also a knowledge gap regarding
the detailed effects of various design and operating variables on DASC
performance, which is crucial for enriching researchers’ understanding
in this area.

This  review  offers  a  comprehensive  discussion  of  all  aspects  of
DASCs, from the physics of the photothermal conversion process to the
effects  of  all  design  and  operating  variables  affecting  system  perfor-
mance. The goal is to provide readers with a detailed document covering
most  details  of  DASCs’  modeling  and  parametric  investigations.  The
review  traces  the  evolution  of  the  DASC  system,  starting  from  its
modification  of  the  conventional  SASC  to  the  latest  advances  in
modeling  and  investigation  attempts  and  state-of-the-art  design
modifications.

The  impacts  of  different  design  and  operating  parameters  on  the
performance of DASCs have been discussed, and optimum ranges have
been suggested [67]. However, a single point of view was adopted, and
the contradictions evident in the literature regarding the DASC response
to  several  parameters  were  not  discussed.  These  contradictions  are
attributed to the limitations of modeling approaches, which are more

thoroughly  examined  in  the  current  review.  This  review  presents  all
possible behaviors and discusses all viewpoints with deep justifications
in light of the state-of-the-art advances in modeling techniques that try
to capture the exact response of DASCs to these problematic parameters.
Detailed explanations of the dissimilarities of DASC performance criteria
behavior,  which  emerge  when  gathering  certain  parameters  together
with certain values, are also provided.

Due to the vast and diverse literature on nanofluid-based DASCs, a
critical review is necessary to categorize, compare, and analyze existing
research. This work fills this gap by providing a comprehensive over-
view encompassing various perspectives. The first part delves into the
state-of-the-art  experimental,  analytical,  and  numerical  modeling  ap-
proaches used to investigate DASC performance and nanofluid proper-
ties  and  stability.  It  critically  examines  these  methods,  highlighting
limitations  and  inconsistencies  in  reported  results.  Additionally,  an
overview of nanofluid stability is presented. The second part explores
the  influence  of  factors  like  nanofluid  properties  (base  fluid  type,
nanoparticle  characteristics),  collector  geometry  (including  recent
design  advancements),  and  operating  conditions  (flow  rate,  tempera-
ture,  dimensionless  numbers)  on  key  performance  indicators  (photo-
thermal conversion efficiency, temperature gain, energy losses). Finally,
the review addresses the economic feasibility and environmental impact
of  nanofluid-based  DASC.  It  concludes  by  highlighting  key  advance-
ments, remaining challenges, knowledge gaps, and future research di-
rections in light of the latest developments.

2. Theoretical analysis of DASC systems

The  basic  principle  behind  the  nanofluid-based  DASC  is  that  the
working  fluid,  whose  OTPs  are  enhanced  by  virtue  of  the  suspended
nanoparticles, directly absorbs solar radiation, as illustrated in the DASC
schematic in Fig. 3, and acquires thermal energy throughout a single-
step  solar-to-thermal  conversion  process.  The  presence  of  nano-
particles considerably enhances the OTPs of typical host heat transfer
fluids and thus the ability of solar absorption and conversion into useful
thermal energy [68,69]. Theoretical modeling approaches often used in
the literature to simulate colloidal suspensions and reveal their radiative
and thermal behaviors are discussed in this section.

2.1. Optical characterization of nanofluids

Fig. 4 illustrates the complete spectrum of electromagnetic radiation.
Gamma  rays,  X-rays,  and  UV  radiation  with  shorter  wavelengths  are
particularly relevant to high-energy physical and engineering applica-
tions,  whereas  microwaves  and  radio  waves  with  longer  wavelengths
(exceeding 105 μm) are of interest to electrical engineers. The interme-
diate segment of the spectrum, ranging from approximately 0.1 to 100
μm,  encompasses  a  portion  of  the  UV  spectrum  as  well  as  the  entire
visible and infrared (IR) spectrum. This intermediate range is referred to
as  thermal  radiation,  as  it  both  is  generated  by  and  influences  the
thermal state or temperature of matter. Nevertheless, in the context of
nanofluid-based DASC systems, the wavelength range that is used in the
volumetric heat absorption calculations is from 200 to 2000 nm [41].

The  interaction  between  solar  radiation  or  any  light  wave  and  a
medium containing fine particles, i.e. nanofluid, can be described by a
phenomenon called the extinction, i.e., attenuation of light while pass-
ing through a medium by out-scattering and absorption [71]. A solution
to the light scattering by such small particles is the Rayleigh regime. The
Rayleigh regime refers to a specific scenario in light scattering where the
particles  causing  the  scattering  are  much  smaller  compared  to  the
wavelength of the light itself (i.e., the particles responsible for scattering
have a diameter less than about one-tenth the wavelength of the light
[72]). However, if the particle size is equal to or larger than the wave-
length of light, a different scattering regime, called Mie scattering, be-
comes more relevant. Useful parameters are employed in literature to
quantify  such  phenomena.  Scattering  efficiency  (Qs)  describes  how
effective  a  particle  is  at  redirecting  light  from  its  original  path.  In
contrast  to  scattering  efficiency,  absorption  efficiency  (Qa)  describes
how effective a particle is at absorbing (i.e. capturing and retaining) the
incident light’s energy. This absorbed energy can be converted into heat.
Both  scattering/absorption  efficiencies  are  dimensionless  quantities,
often expressed as percentages, and representing the ratio of the power
of the scattered/absorbed light to the power of the incident light. The
dominant  mechanism  governing  radiation  extinction  by  ultra-fine
nanoparticles,  particularly  in  the  Rayleigh  regime,  is  absorption.  The
dominance of absorption, in Rayleigh regime, is attributed to the fact
that  the  scattering  efficiency  is  much  lower,  by  several  orders  of
magnitude, than the absorption efficiency [73]. Such physical matters
will be detailed in this section.

Optical characterization of a nanofluid means the determination of
its extinction coefficient (Ke), represented by the sum of scattering co-
efficient (Ks) and absorption coefficient (Ka), complex refractive index
(n + iκ), and other optical constants. The scattering/absorption coeffi-
cient describes how quickly the intensity of a light beam weakens due to
a  scattering/absorption  process  within  the  working  fluid.  A  higher

scattering/absorption  coefficient  indicates  a  material  with  a  more
frequent scattering/absorption process, leading to a more rapid decrease
in light intensity as it travels through. The complex refractive index of a
material incorporates the material’s ability to both refract and absorb
light. The real part (n), so-called refractive index, is a measure of how
much the speed of light is altered when it enters the material (i.e. the
ratio of the speed of light in vacuum to its speed in that material). Ma-
terials  with  a  higher  refractive  index  bend  light  more  than  materials
with a lower index. The imaginary part of the complex refractive index
(κ), so-called absorptive index, describes how much light is absorbed by
the material as it travels through. A higher κ  value indicates stronger
absorption. Many factors have direct effects on the out-scattering and
absorption of light passing through a nanofluid such as the base fluid
material type, and nanoparticle size, shape, loading, and material type.
Also,  the  incident  light  intensity  has  a  main  role  in  determining  the
nanofluid’s  optical  behavior,  where  experiments  by  Vakili  et  al.  [61]
demonstrated that the investigated DASC areas, where incident radia-
tion intensity was high, experienced less transmittance. The theoretical
models  proposed  by  researchers  to  optically  characterize  nanofluids
depend on such factors. This section is dedicated to describing the basic
theoretical optical approaches most widely accepted in the literature to
determine  the  optical  characteristics  of  nanofluids  such  as  the  Mie
scattering, Rayleigh scattering, Discrete Dipole Approximation (DDA),
and Maxwell-Garnett approaches.

2.1.1. Rayleigh scattering approach

For justified adoption of the Rayleigh scattering approximation for
optical characterization of nanofluids, two conditions should be avail-
able: dilute suspension and very fine spherical particles. When the sus-
pension  is  dilute  enough,  the  impacts  of  dependent  scattering  can  be
ignored. Namely, light extinction by a particle is assumed to be unaf-
fected  by  the  adjacent  particles.  This  facilitates  the  evaluation  of  the
radiative  characteristics  and  light  extinction  within  a  particle  cloud
through a summation of those radiative characteristics or light extinc-
tion of individual particles. Independent scattering implies that the ratio
between the particle diameter (Dp) and the incident light wavelength
(λ), i.e., the particle size parameter (α = πDp/λ), is very small (α≪1). To
explain  more,  the  existence  of  neighboring  particles  can  categorize
scattering in a participating medium into dependent and independent. If
light  extinction  (i.e.,  absorption  and  scattering)  of  a  particle  is  influ-
enced by scattering from neighboring particles, scattering is dependent.
However,  if  particles  are  adequately  distant  from  each  other  (i.e.,
interparticle clearance-to-wavelength ratio ≫ 1) where scattering by a
particle is not influenced by the existence of neighboring particles, then
independent scattering assumption is valid. Interparticle clearance (CIP)
is  the  space  or  distance  between  particles,  defined  as:  CIP =

[74]. Thus, based on the independent scattering assump-
tion, the overall intensity of light scattered from a particle cloud can be
considered as the sum of the intensities of light scattered from individual
particles [75]. Furthermore, under the independent scattering assump-
tion, amounts of radiation scattered and absorbed by a cloud of very fine
spherical particles (α≪1) is directly proportional to fV  [71]. Dependent
scattering effects can be neglected in case of solar nanofluids as they,
which  are  the  nanofluids  employed  in  solar  applications,  as  they  can
enhance  the  optical  characteristics  of  the  solar  system,  by  orders  of
magnitude, with tiny volume fractions (fV < 0.001 [76]) and ultrafine
nanoparticles (Dp < 40 nm [77]). Fig. 5 represents the ranges of inde-
pendent and dependent scattering according to fV (on the horizontal axis
as  a  value  between  0  and  1)  and  α,  and  shows  the  location  of  solar
nanofluids on the scattering regime map.

According  to  Tien  and  Dorlen’s  [79]  condition,  the  independent
scattering  approximation  is  applicable  in  nanofluid  optical  character-
ization  studies  if  fV < 0.006.  Nevertheless,  Otanicar  et  al.  [68]  incor-
porated  dependent  and  multiple  scattering  effects  into  their  model,
comparing the DASC photothermal conversion efficiency in scenarios of
independent  scattering  only  and  dependent  and  multiple  scattering.
Investigating 30-nm graphite nanoparticles, the study revealed that the
impact on collector photothermal conversion efficiency due to surpass-
ing the independent scattering limit proposed by Tien and Drolen [79]
(i.e., fV < 0.006) remains below 1 % at fV  of up to around 0.05. Addi-
tionally, Wei et al. [80] conducted a comparison between the indepen-
dent  scattering  approximation  and  other  approaches  considering
multiple and/or dependent scattering effects. Their conclusion asserts
that, for fV > 0.05, in instances where the base fluid is a weak absorber
(e.g., water in the visible spectrum) and small nanoparticles, all models
result  in  comparable  outcomes.  These  observations  by  Refs.  [68,80]
align  more  closely  with  an  alternative  independent  scattering  limit
condition introduced by Howell et al. [81]:

This limit condition is more-relaxed than that introduced by Tien and
Drolen  [79]  as  it  is  stated  based  on  Dp  and  CIP  which,  in  turn,  is  a

function  of  fV.  Therefore,  it  possibly,  depending  on  the  particle  size,
allows for nanofluids with higher concentrations (i.e., fV > 0.006) to be
considered as independent scatterers, thus violating Tien and Drolen’s
[79] limit condition. Kerker et al. [82] reported that the error associated
with the Rayleigh approximation (i.e., the assumption that dependent
scattering effects are negligible in the Rayleigh scattering regime) is less
than 4 % when α < 0.3. Again, the assumption of independent scattering
is  commonly  accepted  when  fV < 0.01  and  particles  are  sufficiently
small [34,57]. However, in a separate investigation conducted by Kumar
and Tien [83], a discrepancy of approximately 5 % in absorption effi-
ciency was identified between independent and dependent approaches
when considering Rayleigh particles with α between 0.01 and 0.1 and at
fV  of 0.06. Conversely, disparities in scattering efficiency between in-
dependent and dependent scattering regimes were observed to be more
pronounced and notably contingent on the specific dependent scattering
model employed. Nevertheless, recognizing absorption as the predom-
inant mechanism for radiation extinction by small absorbing particles in
the  Rayleigh  regime—wherein  the  scattering  efficiency  is  frequently
disregarded due to its substantially lower magnitude compared to ab-
sorption  efficiency—it  can  be  asserted  that  adopting  fV < 0.06  as  a
threshold permits the neglect of dependent effects in solar nanofluids
(for sufficiently small  particles  Dp < 40 nm  [84]) with an  error of no
more than 5 % [85]. Consequently, numerous studies in the literature
have  applied  Rayleigh  scattering  theory  to  assess  nanofluid  optical
properties with fV  exceeding the limit of Tien and Drolen [79] (i.e., fV  =
0.006). This practice was applied in the works of Tyagi et al. [57] (fV  up
to 0.05), Otanicar et al. [34] (fV  up to 0.01), and Saidur et al. [44] (fV  up
to 0.08).

Scattering effects can be neglected for some liquids that are classified
as  strong  absorbers,  and  thus  absorption  is  considered  as  the  only

2.1.2. Maxwell-Garnett approach

This approach is frequently used in the literature to optically char-
acterize composite materials and compute the complex dielectric func-
tions (ε) of nanofluids. The dielectric function, ε = εʹ + iεʹʹ, shows how
the optical characteristic of a material depends on the wavelength of the
incident radiation. εʹ and εʹʹ are the real and imaginary dielectric func-
tions, respectively, given as follows [71]:

εʹ = n2 (cid:0) κ2

εʹʹ = 2nκ

The effective values of n and κ for the nanofluid is determined based
on  information  related  to  the  nanofluid’s  complex  dielectric  function

Fig. 6. Algorithm of Maxwell-Garnett approach.

Using Eqs. (10), and (11), n and κ values of the nanoparticle and base
fluid are first converted into εʹ and εʹʹ values. These values are then used
in Eq. (12) to obtain the εnf , which, in turn, is used in Eqs. (13, and 14) to
find the nanofluid effective values of nnf  and κnf . This algorithm is better
explained in Fig. 6.

In  DASC  systems,  reflection  losses  occur  at  the  interface  of  the
nanofluid with the glass plate and at the interface of the glass plate with
air. The reflectance at an interface is determined by applying the Fresnel
relation under normal incidence between media A and B as follows [88]:

RA/B =

(nA (cid:0) nB)2 + (κA (cid:0) κB)2
(nA + nB)2 + (κA + κB)2

(15)

One can use nnf  and κnf  obtained from the Maxwell-Garnett model in

Eq. (15) to obtain the reflectance at the nanofluid/glass interface.
Finally, the nanofluid’s effective extinction coefficient (Knf

e ) can be
obtained based on the Maxwell-Garnett theory using the imaginary part
of the refractive index of the nanofluid (κnf ), effective absorptive index,
as follows:

It  can  be  observed  that  Knf

fluid (κnf ). In contrast, Knf
e  is obtained in the Rayleigh approach as the
sum of Kbf
e  and Knp

such  as  κnf ,  can  be  obtained  for  the  nanofluid  using  the  Rayleigh
approach.

with fine spherical particles embedded in a host fluid when the particle
size is too large to use the Rayleigh approximation (which requires α≪1)
and too small to use geometric optics (requiring α≫1). The Mie scat-
tering  equations  are  preferred  due  to  their  ability  to  yield  intricate
scattering  parameters,  including  efficiencies  of  scattering,  absorption,
and backscattering (i.e., a phenomenon wherein radiation is scattered at

2.1.4. Discrete dipole approximation (DDA)

by replacing them with an arrangement of N point dipoles. The dipoles
should be arranged such that spacing between them is short relative to
the incident light wavelength. The interaction between the incident light
waves and the electric fields generated by the arrangement of dipoles
results in oscillating polarization in each dipole. These polarizations can
be resolved by solving a group of coupled linear equations derived from
the  equations that govern the electric field  in the dielectric scatterer.
Draine [90] summarized the DDA theory and introduced the DDSCAT
software with the help of Flatau [91]. Draine [90] compared the DDA
results  with  N  of  up  to  2320  with  the  exact  Mie  scattering  approach
calculations for two cases: m = 1.7 + 0.1i and m = 3 + 4i. The agree-
ment between results was excellent.

Optical  characterization  of  non-spherical  nanoparticles  like  gold
nanorods  (AuNRs)  is  frequently  performed  using  the  DDA  [92,93].
Brioude  et  al.  [92]  employed  the  DDA  to  present  a  simulation  of  the
absorption efficiency of gold nanoparticles considering their real shapes.
Authors  concluded  that  the  DDA  is  a  very  useful  prediction  tool  for
nanorods’ radiative characteristics since the presented model-based re-
sults had high agreement with experimental results and theoretical ones
obtained using classical electrostatic predictions and ellipsoidal particle
assumption. Additionally, authors found that the optical characteristics
of nanorods were highly dependent on the nanocrystal aspect ratio, and
that the resonance plasmon bands arising in the absorption spectra could
be  clearly  explained  using  the  DDA.  Similarly,  Jeon  et  al.  [93]
concluded,  based  on  the  DDA, that  the  aqueous  nanofluid containing
AuNRs exhibits an elevated extinction efficiency with an increase in the
aspect ratio of the AuNRs. Authors prepared a nanofluid with AuNRs of
three different aspect ratios to create a nanofluid with tunable absorp-
tion ability. The predicted spectral extinction coefficient of the blended
nanofluid  was  reported  in  the  visible  and  near  IR  spectral  band  and
found that it was in good agreement with experimental data as shown in
Fig. 7.

2.1.5. Comments on basic optical theories

While the Rayleigh scattering approach offers a simple and effective
method  for  predicting  the  optical  properties  of  nanofluids  containing
small particles, it falls short when dealing with size-dependent effects,
particularly  for  metallic  nanofluids.  Here  is  where  the  Drude  (free
electron)  model  comes  in.  The  Drude  model  incorporates  the  size-
dependent properties of metallic nanoparticles, specifically accounting
for the collective motion of free electrons within them. This allows for a
more  accurate  prediction  of  how  the  optical  response,  including  ab-
sorption and scattering, changes as the nanoparticle size decreases. This
size  dependence  is  crucial  for  understanding  the  behavior  of  many

fV  of 1 ppm [93]. (Reused with permission from OPTICA Publishing group).

metallic nanofluids, where smaller particles can exhibit enhanced light
absorption  compared  to  their  larger  counterparts.  Therefore,  for
metallic nanofluids and situations where size plays a significant role, the
Drude model provides a more complete picture compared to the limi-
tations of the Rayleigh scattering approach.

Otanicar  et  al.  [34]  adapted  the  Drude  model  to  account  for  the
size-dependent effects on the optical properties  of nanoparticles. This
adjustment  was  incorporated  into  the  numerical  methodology  by
introducing modifications to the extinction and absorption coefficients
within the radiative transport equation (RTE). When the incident radi-
ation triggers surfaces of electrons of metallic nanoparticles whose di-
ameters are less than the mean free path of the conduction electrons in
their bulk metallic material (for instances, 53.3, 39.9, and 18.9 nm for
Ag, Cu, and Al, respectively [94]), the electrons oscillation causes the
surface plasmon to be excited due to the resonant transfer of energy from
the incident photon to the plasmon yielding a significant increase in the
radiative  energy  absorption  [41].  The  optical  characteristics  of  such
nanoparticles  are  then  a  function  of  the  nanoparticle  size.  Also,  the
nanofluid  optical  characteristics  are  altered  due  to  the  oscillation
interaction  at  the  metal-dielectric-medium  interface  [69].  Such  plas-
monic nanofluids can be optically characterized using the Drude theory
that  has  been  numerically  solved  and  experimentally  validated  [95].
The mathematical formulation of the Drude model is demonstrated in
Otanicar et al. [34] research.

This model presents a nanofluid’s effective complex dielectric func-
tion depending on nanoparticle size [42,95], which, in turn, can be used
in  the  Maxwell-Garnett  equations  to  obtain  size-dependent  refractive
and absorptive indices of the nanofluid.

Optical  characteristics  of  nanofluids  containing  nanoparticles
composed of dielectric cores and metallic shells, such as the Si-core and
Cu-, Au-, Al-, or Ag-shell nanoparticles, were investigated by Lv et al.
[96]  based  on  the  Rayleigh  approach  assuming  a  quasi-steady  state.
Moreover,  the  effect  of  dependency  on  nanoparticle  size  in  optical
properties calculations was included based on the Drude model because
the metallic nanoparticle’s dielectric function depends on its size, and it
can  be  clearly  distinguished  from  the  dielectric  function  of  the  bulk
fluid.  Authors  concluded  that  such  core-shell  nanoparticles  are  good
choices  to  create  appropriate  nanofluids  for  functional  solar  energy
harvesting  systems,  especially,  knowing  that  such  nanofluids  have
tunable capability of radiation energy absorption.

Back to the Rayleigh approach once again, it is frequently used in the
literature  to  theoretically  obtain  the  optical  characteristics  of  a  rela-
tively wide range of nanofluids of low concentrations [44,87,97–100].
However, it results in more accurate predictions for the general optical
performance  of  nanofluids  composed  of  carbon-based  or  core-shell
particles  than  those  composed  of  metallic  or  metal  oxide  particles,
particularly in certain wavelength bands. More specifically, the Rayleigh
approximation  results  in  accurate  Knf
e  predictions  for  graphite-based
nanofluids,  overestimations  for  metal-based  nanofluids  within  the
relatively short wavelengths (< 700 nm), and underestimations for the
metal-based  nanofluids  within  longer  wavelengths,  as  discussed  by
Taylor et al. [87]. Those authors experimentally and numerically char-
acterized nanofluids composed of strong carbon-based nanoparticles as
graphite, and metallic nanoparticles as Al, Cu, and Ag. Authors justified
the  deviation  of  the  Rayleigh  model  results,  in  the  case  of  metallic
nanoparticles, by the agglomeration and the oxidation of their surfaces.
For  a  more  thorough  investigation  on  carbon-based  nanofluids,  Gan
et al. [101] optically characterized two Ethanol-based nanofluids, one is
seeded by MWCNT and the other by carbon nanoparticles (CNPs), based
on the Rayleigh approximation while satisfying the Rayleigh assumption
condition (i.e., α≪1) in the studied radiation wavelength range. Authors
found that the Rayleigh model was capable of predicting the extinction
coefficients of both nanofluids accurately in the visible light wavelength
band ( 380 (cid:0) 780 nm), but it failed in the UV range.

Zhang et al. [99] optically characterized ionic liquid-based nanofluids
seeded by copper, nickel, and carbon-coated nickel nanoparticles using
the  Rayleigh  theory.  Results  showed  almost  the  same  assertions  pro-
vided by Taylor et al. [87] about the aforementioned wavelength ranges
over  which  Rayleigh  theory  overestimates  or  underestimates  Knf
e  of
metal-based nanofluids. Moreover, for the radiation of wavelength less
than  1200  nm,  as  illustrated  in  Fig.  8,  the  theory  was  not  accurate
enough in Knf
e  predictions, especially for copper and nickel nanoparticles
because  such  metals  are  subject  to  surface  oxidation.  Metallic  nano-
particle  surface  oxidation  causes  oxidized  particles  to  exhibit  distinct
optical  properties  compared  to  their  unoxidized  counterparts.  Also,
nanoparticle agglomeration deforms their spherical shape and enlarges
their size over the initial (rated) one used in calculations, which leads to
inconsistencies between the experimental results and Rayleigh theory
predictions.

Otanicar et al. [97] studied the Au-based nanofluid’s optical char-
acteristics using the Rayleigh approach with inclusion of the tempera-
ture increase impacts on the refractive index of the host fluid and the
effect  of  nanoparticle  size,  utilizing  an  approximation  proposed  by
Bashkatov  and  Genina  [102]  and  a  model  proposed  by  Turcotte  and
Schubert [103], respectively. Bashkatov and Genina [102] presented a
simple  approximation  of  the  refractive  index  of  water  based  on  the
temperature  and  wavelength  in  the  range  (200–1000  nm).  The  de-
pendency of refractive index on temperature and wavelength was per-
formed  by  curve  fitting  of  data  published  in  the  literature.  The  data
showed that the water refractive index decreases with increasing both
the temperature and wavelength. Also, since the increase in the nano-
fluid temperature increases the nanoparticle size that, in turn, changes α
and fV, the optical properties obtained by the Rayleigh theory will be
influenced. Therefore, Turcotte and Schubert [103] modeled the final
diameter of a particle at a certain temperature, D’(T), as:

Back to Otanicar et al. [97], the results showed that the temperature
increase led to changes in the host fluid’s refractive index which caused
deterioration  in  the  effective  absorption  coefficient  of  the  nanofluid
(Knf
a ) and thus an increase in the light transmission. Also, authors stated
that the nanoparticle size, at higher temperatures, had inconsiderable
impacts on the nanofluid absorption ability confirming the aforemen-
tioned conclusions in this regard.

As for  metal-oxide nanoparticle characterization, Said et  al. [104]
experimentally, using Beer Lambert method, and theoretically, using the
Rayleigh theory, investigated water/Al2O3  and water/TiO2  nanofluids
within the spectral range from 200 to 1100 nm. For Al2O3, comparable
trends in Knf
e  curves were identified as predicted through analytical and
experimental analyses. Nevertheless, a substantial disparity between the
experimental  and  analytical  values  of  the  extinction  coefficient  was
observed.  Experimental  data  exceeded  analytical  estimations  by  over
tenfold  in  the  UV  region,  whereas  in  the  visible  and  IR  regions,  the
difference between the results decreased from tenfold to 1 time.

Also, Sajid et al. [98] stated that the Rayleigh theory fails to predict
the  water/Al2O3  nanofluid  optical  characteristics  in  the  UV  radiation
band  due  to  the  increasing  scattering  effects  caused  by  nanoparticle
agglomeration,  which  indicates  that  the  computed  extinction  was
mainly due to scattering rather than absorption. It should be noted, in
this regard, that the scattering efficiency of a nanoparticle exhibits 1/λ4
dependence on the incident radiation wavelength, as illustrated in Eq.
(6).  And  since  α≪1,  the  scattering  efficiency  is,  in  theory,  orders  of
magnitude less than the absorption efficiency, as clarified by Eqs. (5)
and  (6).  This  justifies  neglecting  the  scattering  efficiency  of  nano-
particles in Knf

e  theoretical calculations.

As for the Maxwell-Garnett approach, it was observed that it presents
inaccurate predictions of nanofluids’ optical characteristics [69]. Taylor
et al. [87] stated that the Maxwell-Garnett theory underestimates the
absorptive indices of nanofluids leading to underestimated Knf
in Fig. 9.

e , as shown

Moreover, a comparison between the Knf

e  of MWCNT nanofluid ob-
tained based on the Maxwell-Garnett theory and that obtained based on
the Rayleigh approach was made by Lee et al. [105]. Authors concluded
that the former method that considered the nanoparticle shape effect as
a cylinder failed to yield an accurate Ke  prediction, but the latter one
could result in good predictions by adjusting the nanoparticles’ hydro-
dynamic diameters.

The Rayleigh theory is preferable, due to its simplicity, as long as
α≪1. However, when α ≈ 1, the  Mie theory  is a  better choice  [106].
Several  researchers  stated  that  Mie  theory  yields  more  accurate  Knf

predictions especially when the model considers the nanoparticle size
and dynamic light scattering (DLS) [86,107], which is a non-destructive
material characterization technique used to determine the size and size
distribution of particles in suspensions. For example, Song et al. [107]
used both Rayleigh and Mie scattering theories to describe the optical
properties of Water/Al2O3 and Ethyl-Alcohol/Al2O3 nanofluids. Authors
found that experimental and Mie theory-based absorption coefficients
were  reasonably  agreed  when  considering  nanoparticles  aggregation.
However, Rayleigh theory overestimated optical properties with several
orders of magnitude. Strong agreement between Mie theory predictions
and  experimental  results  is  observed  when  the  particles  within  the
nanofluid  are  spherical  and  act  as  independent  scatterers  [108–110].
Kameya  and  Hanmaura  [108],  assuming  independent  scattering,
examined the absorption coefficient of Ni/alkyl naphthalene using the
Mie  theory  and  observed  high  agreement  between  experimental  and
theoretical results in the visible and near IR spectral region (see Fig. 10).
However, considerable  deviations between theory and experiment re-
sults  can  occur  due  to  nanoparticle  agglomeration,  where  particles
clump together resulting in larger particle clusters [110–112]. In such
cases, the Mie theory might overestimate the spectral transmittance of
the  nanofluid.  Zhu  et  al.  [111]  reported  that  the  Mie  theory  over-
estimated  the  (AlN/water)  nanofluid’s  spectral  transmittance  due  to
agglomeration that caused the actual size of particles to become eight
times greater than the manufacturer-rated size. Furthermore, the accu-
racy  of  the  Mie  theory  can  be  impacted  by  the  size  of  nanoparticles
[113], where predictions become less accurate for particles exceeding a
certain size at specific spectral ranges as detailed in Ref. [109].

One  of  the  causes  that  explain  why  such  theoretical  nanofluid
characterization  techniques  cannot  present  accurate  predictions  of
nanofluids’  optical  characteristics  is  that  researchers  take  the  nano-
particle size in calculations as the average size given by the manufac-
turer  ignoring  the  changes  coming  over  it  due  to  clustering  and
agglomeration. Particle agglomeration is usually caused by the two-step
nanofluid preparation technique, especially at fV  of greater than 0.01%
and  when  nanoparticles  do  not  experience  a  proper  functionalization
process  [69].  This  phenomenon  presents  a  double-edged  sword  for
nanofluid-based  solar  systems.  While  it  might  potentially  cause  en-
hancements  in  the  solar  extinction  ability  of  nanofluids,  it  adversely
influences  their  overall  OTPs.  Du  and  Tang  [112]  examined  the
extinction  coefficient  of  Ag/water  nanofluid  and  observed  that
agglomeration  increases  the  long-wave  scattering  and  decreases  ab-
sorption  peaks  in  short  wavelength  bands.  Authors  concluded  that
agglomeration  enhances  the  nanofluid’s  extinction  coefficient  at
large-wavelength (> 1 μm) for fV  of 0.5 (cid:0) 2%, which improves the solar

energy harvesting applications performance. In contrast, it was reported
in  literature  that  the  nanofluid  with  a  lower  stability  factor  exhibits
lower solar absorption and storage abilities [114] (this will be detailed
in  section  4).  However,  agglomeration  deteriorates  the  stability  and
thermal  conductivity  (kc)  of  the  nanofluid.  This  phenomenon  can
adversely  affect  the  efficiency  of  solar  collectors,  as  the  uniform
dispersion of nanoparticles is crucial for enhancing the thermal prop-
erties of the suspension. Agglomeration of nanoparticles deteriorates the
performance of the system by reducing the effective surface area for heat
transfer and increasing the viscosity of the nanofluid, leading to higher
pumping power requirements. Moreover, when particle agglomeration
occurs, the effects of dependent scattering between agglomerated par-
ticles  cannot  be  overlooked.  The  independent  scattering  model  is  no
longer  acceptable  and  new  optical  theories  are  necessary.  Therefore,
researchers stated that Rayleigh approach is no longer valid for evalu-
ation of nanofluids’ optical properties when agglomeration occurs due
to the increased particle size [107,115]. The small nanoparticle size, in
DASCs,  translates  to  negligible  scattering  compared  to  the  significant
absorption efficiency, as evidenced by a wavelength-averaged absorp-
tion  to  scattering  efficiencies  ratio  of  around  104  in  solar  nanofluids
containing spherical nanoparticles [84,116]. This absorption dominance
holds  true  even  for  non-spherical  particles  like  carbon  nanohorns
(CNHs), where scattering contributes a mere 5 % to the total reduction
in  light  intensity  [117].  However,  size  plays  a  crucial  role.  As  nano-
particles increase in size or cluster together, the balance between scat-
tering and absorption shifts dramatically. For instance, CNHs reaching
around 150 nm in size can scatter a significant portion (30 %) of the light
[118], and for gold spheres exceeding 88 nm, scattering can even sur-
pass  absorption,  becoming  the  primary  interaction  with  light  [119].
Bohren and Huffman [73] stated a formula to predict the intensity of
scattered light (Is) when a nanofluid is exposed to an incident light with
intensity of Io:

≈

where Ns, θ, and r are the number of scattered particles, scattering angle,
and  distance  at  which  scattered  light  is  observed,  respectively.  The
greater  the  nanoparticle size  the  more severe  the  agglomeration phe-
nomenon is, and thus the amount of scattering increases as seen in the
correlation  above.  Consequently,  the  numerical  models  dedicated  for
nanofluid optical characterization that assume independent scattering
cannot  accurately  predict  the  nanofluid  radiative  behavior  anymore.
DLS  nanoparticle  size  measurements  were  considered  in  radiation
scattering calculations in some investigations in the literature to yield
more  accurate  optical  behavior  predictions  [105,107,109].  Further-
more, the nanomaterial impurity and oxidization are considered as main
reasons for the discrepancy between the experimentally-measured and
numerically-predicted  nanofluids’  optical  characteristics.  These  phe-
nomena are caused by the reduction of metal particle size, specifically,
to the nanoscale, which causes a sharp increase in their surface energy.
However, the dielectric constants and refractive indices of nanoparticles
are assumed to be equal to their bulk materials in optical calculations
[69].

Selecting  the  most  appropriate  optical  characterization  theory  de-
pends on several considerations. Mie theory, while offering a compre-
hensive  solution  for  spherical  scattering  that  accommodates  both
absorbing and non-absorbing particles without specific size constraints,
is constrained by the necessity for particles to be similar and isotropic
[120].  Despite  its  efficacy  in  elucidating  various  spherical  scattering
particle systems, including Rayleigh scattering, Mie theory’s intricacies
often  lead  to  a  preference  for  Rayleigh  scattering  when  applicable,
owing  to  its  simpler  nature.  For  simplicity,  the  Rayleigh  theory  is
favored, but its applicability should be ensured, namely, the suspension
should be with low volume fraction and small particle size. The DDA
stands out as a versatile method with broad applicability, limited only by

available  computational  power.  Also,  as  seen  earlier,  Mie  theory  en-
counters  limitations  when  the  nanofluid  experiences  agglomeration,
necessitating alternative approaches like the Diffusion Limited Cluster
Aggregation (DLCA), Generalized Multi-particle Mie (GMM) and Finite
Difference Time Domain (FDTD) methods. In these methods, effects of
dependent  scattering  between  particles,  particle  agglomeration,  and
particle  size  and  loading  on  the  nanofluid’s  extinction  coefficient  are
accounted for [112].

However, the sensitivity of nanoparticles’ optical characteristics to
nanoparticle  agglomeration  is  well-established.  Precise  predictions  of
these  optical  properties  highly  depend  on  cluster’s  size  and  shape.
Therefore, it is crucial to correlate the structure of clusters with their
optical  characteristics  using  methods  that  are  appropriate  for
engineering-scale systems. This task grows increasingly intricate when
dealing  with  nonspherical  particles,  like  carbon  nanotubes  (CNTs)  or
coated nanoparticles. It is equally complex when considering the pres-
ence of stabilizing agents like polymers and surfactants, as well as the
impact of fluid shear on deformation, fragmentation, and restructuring
of clusters. In existing literature, there is a notable gap in both experi-
mental  and  theoretical research  addressing how  these elements  influ-
ence the clustering kinetics and cluster structure, which in turn affects
the  optical  characteristics  of  nanofluids  [77].  However,  given  the
infrequency of aggregation in DASC systems due to the very low volume
fraction of solar nanofluids, this study was confined to the basic optical
theories.

2.2. Governing equations of DASC systems

Developing  an  efficient  nanofluid-based  DASC  requires  a  rigorous
understanding of its radiative and thermal behaviors. To that end, many
questions  about  the  interaction  of  the  sunlight  and  nanofluid  in  the
collector,  attainable  temperatures,  and  collector  ηPC  should  be
answered.  Therefore,  a  mathematical  model  that  can  thoroughly
describe these aspects is essential. Such a model would not only enable
accurate predictions of DASC performance but also facilitate the opti-
mization of various design and operating parameters.

◦

Unlike conventional SASCs in which the temperature difference be-
tween  the  absorber  and  working  fluid  could  reach  100
C  or  more,
particles seeded in the working medium in DASCs are nearly with the
same temperature as the host fluid’s due to the huge particle surface-
area-to-volume  ratio [28,35,47,63].  I.e., it  can be assumed  that there
is  no  temperature  slip  between  particles  and  the  base  fluid.  Such  an
approximation  entails  more  efficient  and  instantaneous  overall  heat
transfer between the nanoparticles and host fluid [63], and thus negli-
gible  temperature  difference  between  them,  which  justifies  the
single-phase isotropic nanofluid assumption. Such heat transfer mech-
anisms can be resolved using a coupled radiative and convective heat
transfer  model  to  predict  the  collector  thermal  response.  Researchers
have  initially  presented  numerical  models  to  investigate  volumetric
absorption  collectors  of  opaque  bottom  walls  and  non-scattering
semi-transparent  working  media  [121,122].  Then,  Kumar  and  Tien
[123]  proposed  a  simple  analytical  framework  combining  the  spatial
and spectral optical characteristics of particle-laden fluids besides the
boundary  conditions.  This  work  introduced  a  fundamental  modeling
contribution  in  the  volumetric  absorption  investigations.  The  work
presented an analytical solution to the coupled radiative transport and
energy equations that govern the DASC system. Chronologically, Miller
and Koenigsdroff, in two separate pieces of research [47,124], expanded
these previous contributions to involve carbon particles oxidation in a
3D  mathematical  model.  They  proposed  a  thermal  model  for  a  volu-
metric  absorption  central  solar  collector  utilizing  a  working  fluid
composed of micron carbon particles blended in a gaseous medium. The
RTE was solved to state the spectral and regional distribution of solar
flux  in  the  collector  including  the  impacts  of  scattering  and  emission
from the working fluid and collector walls. Besides, the energy equation
was solved to obtain the temperature profile of the flow. Later, in 2009,

the  past  models  were  simplified  and  the  nanofluid-based  DASC  was
particularly modeled by Tyagi et al. [57]. And then, Otanicar et al. [68]
built on their model to optically characterize nanofluids in DASC sys-
tems taking into consideration the multiple radiation scattering and the
nanoparticle  size.  Although  the  aforementioned  numerical  modeling
attempts  provided  good  understanding  of  DASCs,  its  optimal  design
features, until that moment, were unclear. For instance, the past math-
ematical  modeling  contributions  [46,47,57,68]  had  just  taken  into
consideration specific incorporations of certain nanoparticles and host
fluids in a particular geometry. On the other hand, even simple volu-
metric  absorption  collectors  have  many  different  parameters  to  vary,
causing  difficulties  in  the  collector  behavior  prediction  using  the
coupled radiative and energy equations.

2.2.1. Radiative transport equation (RTE)

The RTE mathematically describes the interaction and propagation
of  radiation  within  a  certain  medium,  that  could  be  scattering,
absorbing,  and/or  emitting.  It  is  given,  in  the  most  general  form,  as
follows [125]:

dIλ
dS

= (cid:0) KaIλ(S) (cid:0) KsIλ(S) + KaIλ,b(S, Tm) + Ks
4π

∫

4π

Ωi=0

Iλ(S, Ωi)Φ(λ, Ω, Ωi) dΩi

(24)

Iλ(S), Ka, Ks, Iλ,b, Tm, Ω, and Φ are the intensity of spectral radiation in
the direction S, absorption coefficient, scattering coefficient, blackbody
radiation  intensity,  medium  temperature,  solid  angle,  and  scattering
phase function. The terms on the right-hand side of the RTE account for
radiative energy lost from or gained by the incoming light beam: the
radiative  absorption  loss,  out-scattering  loss,  emissive  gain,  and  in-
scattering gain in the S direction, respectively.

The  RTE  can  be  significantly  reduced  if  the  scattering  terms  are
dropped  according  to  the  negligible  scattering  effect  approximation
when fV  is very low and particles are ultra-small, as discussed earlier.
Moreover, the utilization of nanofluids with low fV  is more useful for the
collector because out-scattering, that increases with fV, does not cause
any increase in the thermal energy of the system. The simplified y-di-
rection RTE according to this approximation is frequently used in the
literature with the form:

dIλ(y)
dy

= (cid:0) KeIλ(y)

(25)

In  addition  to  the  conventional  numerical  solutions  of  differential
equations  using  discretization  techniques  such  as  the  finite  volume
method (FVM) [63,126–129], finite element method (FEM) [41,130],
and finite difference method (FDM) [34,46,57,131], which can be used
to solve the RTE, the RTE is frequently solved in the literature based on
stochastic  and  deterministic  solution  techniques  including  the  Monte
Carlo (MC), PN, and differential discrete ordinate (DDO) methods.

2.2.1.1. Monte  Carlo  (MC)  method. The  RTE  is  converted,  in  the  MC
method,  into  a  sequence  of  probabilistic  problems  through  several
numbers generated randomly. As a nanofluid is exposed to light, light
photons  experience  partial  scattering  and  absorption  during  propaga-
tion  within  the  nanofluid.  The  probability  density  function  (P(S))
describing the absorbed or scattered photons depending on the distance
they crossed is [132]:

P(S) = Kee

(cid:0) Ke l

(26)

where l is the path length or distance crossed by the photon before it is
scattered or absorbed, i.e. the free path length. l can be calculated by the
inverse transform sampling:

l = (cid:0) ln R
Ke

(27)

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience103(2024)10116012

A. Hasan et al.

where R is a number between 0 and 1 uniformly and randomly gener-
ated via a quasi-random sequence. As discussed, to determine the optical
characteristics of a heterogeneous nanofluid, it should be divided into
several  sublayers  with  the  possibility  of  neglecting  the  sub-layers’
interfacial effects due to the low nanoparticle loading in case of DASC
systems. The distance a photon crosses determines the ith  layer in which
the photon is positioned. The distance the photon crosses from the layer i
boundary is denoted as lb, and the photon is considered that it left the
layer i if l > lb. The photon’s remaining motion step remains updated as
long as the ith  layer boundary is not the working fluid boundary. How-
ever,  because  of  the  difference  between  the  working  fluid  and  envi-
ronment media and thus the difference between their refractive indices,
the  photons  could  be  refracted  or  reflected  as  they  pass  through  the
boundary interface. The proportion of the reflected photons (Rr) can be
calculated using the Fresnel equation as:
)

[(

Rr = Rs + Rp

m1 cos Θi (cid:0) m2 cos Θt
m1 cos Θi + m2 cos Θt

2

+

m1 cos Θt (cid:0) m2 cos Θi
m1 cos Θt + m2 cos Θi

2

(28)

where Rs, Rp, m1, m2, Θi  and Θt  are the proportion of s-polarized pho-
tons,  proportion  of  p-polarized  photons,  refractive  index  of  the  envi-
ronment, refractive index of the nanofluid, angle of incidence, and angle
of  transmission,  respectively.  One  more  random  number  (R1)  is  uni-
formly generated to check if the photon experiences an internal reflec-
tion, which is true if Rr > R1  and its position and velocity are updated.
But if Rr ≤ R1, the photon’s motion direction is determined.

If l < lb, the photon is still inside the working medium. An additional
random number (R2) is generated to determine if the photon is absorbed
or scattered. If Ka/Ke > R2, the photon is absorbed and its packet weight
decreases, and thus absorption counter is updated. But if Ka/ Ke ≤ R2,
the photon is scattered and its new motion direction is determined as
described in Refs. [41,132] in which the MC method is detailed. Finally,
the number of reflected, transmitted, and absorbed photons are divided
by the total number of photons to determine the nanofluid’s reflectance
(Rλ),  transmittance  (Tλ),  and  absorptance  (Aλ),  respectively,  over  the
entire solar spectrum. Thus, the nanofluid’s absorption efficiency (ηA)
can be calculated as follows:

ηA

∫ λmax
λmin Io,λ.Aλ dλ
∫ λmax

(29)

2.2.1.2. PN  method. The  basic  principle  behind  the  PN  method  is  the
approximation of transfer relations as a determinate group of high-order
moment equations for the RTEs to be converted from the integral form to
the  differential  form.  It  is  useful  when  dealing  with  anisotropic  scat-
tering in complex geometries [133].

2.2.1.3. Differential discrete ordinate (DDO) method. This method’s goal
is to introduce the generic transfer equations by discretizing an equa-
tions  bundle  for  the  mean  intensity  over  a  few  angular  zones  and
assuming that the radiation intensity is constant throughout these zones
[46,134].

Considerations  regarding  radiation  and  heat  loss  especially  at
elevated  temperatures  are  overlooked  when  using  the  conventional
model  (namely,  the  simplified  y-direction  RTE  explained  in  section
2.2.1) commonly used in the literature to resolve the radiative behavior
of DASCs [57,131,136–138]. Most pieces of research in the DASC field
share a common simplification of radiative heat transfer. For instance,
solar  irradiance was assumed to vary solely along the y-axis, and the
emission and scattering of radiation by the working fluid were neglec-
ted.  Consequently,  the  impact  of  radiation  was  simplified  to  a  heat
source  dependent  solely  on  the  y  coordinates.  Radiative  heat  loss  is
addressed through an effective coefficient, along with convective heat
loss.  Very  recently,  Zhu  et  al.  [135]  developed  a  numerical  model

predicting the photothermal conversion performance of a DASC based
on  the  DDO  method.  The  proposed  model  presents  the  previous  con-
siderations.  The  authors  addressed  the  RTE  of  a  fluid  using  the  DDO
method in finite-volume form and introduced a self-programming model
utilizing Python script for the photothermal conversion of DASC. Com-
parisons  between  the  outcomes  obtained  from the  novel  and  conven-
tional model under conditions of both low and high temperatures were
conducted  to  ascertain  the  accuracy  and  advantages  of  the  novel
approach.  Radiative  heat  loss  was  assessed  across  diverse  collector
temperatures and solar concentration ratios. Additionally, the impact of
the angle of incidence on conversion efficiency was analyzed. The pro-
posed  model  extends  the  applicability  of  the  DASC  numerical  model
from  low  to  high  temperatures.  The  authors  presented  comparisons
between  their  proposed  DDO  model  and  the  common  conventional
◦
C
model when simulated a DASC with an operating temperature of 500
(very  close  to  the  limit  condition  (i.e.,  750  K)  below  which  radiative
losses  can  be  neglected).  They  showed  that  the  conventional  model
overestimated the outlet temperature and ηPC  by 27.6
C and 18.9 %,
respectively. Results of the proposed model present a reference for ηPC
enhancements in DASCs at high temperatures.

2.2.1.4. Limitations of existing RTE solution techniques. A literature sur-
vey  showed  that  solutions  to  the  RTE  can  be  accepted  with  reduced
accuracy in many cases such as the very dilute suspension case at which
the in-scattering impacts can be ignored [34,57,130,131]. Also, the gray
participating medium assumption can be stated to investigate nanofluids
[28,139].  Also,  the  in-scattering  augmentation  effects  are  neglected
because the scattering efficiency is very small compared to the absorp-
tion efficiency [34,57]. The reduction of the general form of RTE to the
simplified  RTE  used  in  DASC  studies  is  conducted  based  on  such  ap-
proximations.  Given  that  the  thickness  of  the  suspension  layer  is
significantly smaller than the length of the collector [46] and the inci-
dent radiation is assumed to be normal to the collector surface, varia-
tions in radiative heat flux throughout the suspension are considered to
occur along the negative vertical axis only. Also, the in-scattering term is
dropped in case of dilute suspensions used in DASCs [34,57,130,131],
and  the  gray  participating  medium  assumption  can  be  applied  for
colloidal suspensions [28]. Moreover, the emissive radiation loss term is
neglected  when  the  operating  temperature  is  below  750  K  as  it  is
responsible for less than 5 % of the overall radiative losses [136,137].
The general RTE is simplified accordingly.

Radiative transfer numerical methods can be categorized into two
main groups: stochastic simulation methods and deterministic methods,
typically  formulated  based  on  the  integral  or  differential  form  of  the
RTE.  Stochastic  methods,  such  as  the  MC  Method,  belong  to  the  first
group, offering versatility and reliability but often demanding in terms
of  computational  time  due  to  the  tracing  of  a  substantial  number  of
photons. They also face challenges when coupled with conduction and
convection solvers, which typically employ deterministic methods like
the FDM, FVM, and FEM. On the other hand, the DDO method belongs to
the second group. FVM can be viewed as a specific type of DDO method
where  discrete  ordinate  equations  are  derived  using  FVM  principles.
FEM, known for its superior accuracy compared to FVM, stands out for
its  versatility  and  holds  promise  for  simulating  multiphysics  systems,
encompassing radiative energy transport [140].

As  approximate  techniques,  numerical  methods  encounter  various
types of errors. The MC method grapples with statistical errors, while the
DDO method, FVM, and FEM contend with errors stemming from space
and  angular  discretization.  These  errors  can  introduce  unphysical
characteristics to the solution, rendering it challenging to interpret and,
in  some  cases,  undermining  the  solution  entirely.  Therefore,  under-
standing the origin and nature of numerical errors is crucial. Such un-
derstanding  aids  in  the  interpretation  of  numerical  simulation  results
and  facilitates  the  development  of  strategies  to  mitigate  or  eliminate
errors. The DDO method, for instance, has long been recognized to suffer

from false scattering and ray effects, prompting the proposal of strate-
gies to alleviate these issues. Consequently, false scattering and ray ef-
fects emerge as two general types of numerical errors that require in-
depth  comprehension.  An  in-depth  grasp  of  limitations  of  numerical
techniques used to solve the RTE and numerical errors associated with
its solutions is presented in Ref. [141].

2.2.2. Colloidal suspension governing equations: applicability and
limitations

The energy equation form differs according to the geometry and flow
conditions  of  the  investigated  system.  In  case  of  a  2D  (x  and  y  di-
rections), steady flow and y-directional radiative transport, the energy
equation can be given as follows [46]:

where  ρ,  cp,  kc,  u,  v,  T,  and  qr  are  the  density, specific  heat,  thermal
conductivity,  x-velocity,  y-velocity,  medium  temperature,  and  total
radiative  heat  flux,  respectively.  The negative  divergence of  the  total
radiative  heat  flux  term,  ∂qr(x, y)/∂y,  is  used  to  couple  the  energy
equation with the RTE and thus the temperature distribution within the
working fluid can be obtained. The total radiative heat flux, qr(x, y), is
defined based on the spectral solar radiation flux (Iλ), as follows [85]:

ation, different CFD techniques can be used. Macroscale, mesoscale, and
microscale techniques, respectively, may be used as the length and time
scales of the system range from large to small scales, as shown in Fig. 11.
Macroscale  techniques  include  the  fully-continuous  and  continuous-
discrete approaches. Mesoscale and microscale techniques employ ap-
proaches  such  as  the  Lattice  Boltzmann  method  (LBM),  dissipative
particle  dynamics  (DPD)  method,  smoothed  particle  hydrodynamics
(SPH) method, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation.

The fully continuous approach is the simplest and most widely used
in  DASC  investigations.  It  is  based  on  handling  the  suspension  as  a
single-phase  continuous  medium,  where  nanoparticles  are  homoge-
neously  distributed,  with  averaged  (effective)  thermophysical  proper-
ties. Or it assumes that the dispersed solid phase and fluid phase are two
different  interpenetrating  continua.  Then,  it  is  called  the  Eulerian-
Eulerian approach. On the other hand, the hybrid continuous-discrete
approach is based on treating the base fluid as a continuous medium
and the dispersed particles as discrete points moving in the flow field.
The Lagrangian model offers detecting the discrete particle trajectories
while moving in the flow domain. In the fully Lagrangian approach, both
the base fluid and nanoparticles are treated as individual discrete par-
ticles moving through space and time.

The  continuous  base  fluid  is  always  investigated  based  on  the
Eulerian approach when dealing with the macroscale level. However,
the appropriate approach for handling the dispersed solid particle phase
is  determined  based  on  the  particle  size  (Dp)  or  response  time  (τ),
compared to the characteristic time (τc) and length (L) scales of the base
fluid, and the particle loading. The particle response time (τ) is the time
taken for a particle to reach a new equilibrium state after a stimulus is
applied. It is given for spherical particles and Stokes regime as [142]:

τ =

p

ρpD2
18μf

(33)

The characteristic time scale of the base fluid (τc) is defined as the

time it takes the base liquid to pass through a channel of length L:

(32)

τc = L
u

(34)

where U is the mean velocity, and   ̇qʹʹʹ(y) is the volumetric heat generation
within the working fluid given as  (cid:0) ∂qr(y)/∂y. Modeling the flows in
systems  employing  solid-liquid  suspensions,  including  DASCs  and
parallel-plate micro-channels, can be performed using the fully contin-
uous  (Eulerian),  continuous-discrete  (Eulerian-Lagrangian),  and  fully
discrete (fully-Lagrangian) approaches. Due to the high nonlinearity of
equations governing the flow and heat transfer of colloidal suspensions,
CFD techniques are utilized to solve them rather than analytical ones.
Depending on the length and time scales of the system under consider-

where u is the base fluid’s superficial velocity calculated from the fluid
flow’s  free  cross-sectional  area.  Now,  the  Stokes  number  (St)  can  be
calculated as the ratio between τ and τc:

St =

τ
τc

(35)

Being  St≪1  means  that  dispersed  particles  have  enough  time  to
respond to variations in the base fluid velocity. Consequently, the par-
ticle velocity approaches the base fluid’s one (i.e., velocity equilibrium).
The dispersed particles, whereupon, are considered as fluid tracers in the
flow  field  [142].  However,  if  St > 1,  dispersed  particles  do  not  have
enough time to respond to changes in the base fluid velocity, and thus,
the  particle  velocity  exhibits  differences  from  the  base  fluid  one.  For
such  large  St’s,  dispersed  particles  separate  from  the  base  fluid
streamlines and move in their own directions [142].

Another quantity is to evaluate how long it takes for a particle to
respond to the change in the continuous phase temperature, called the
thermal response time (τT). Based on this quantity, the thermal Stokes
number  (StT)  is  calculated.  When  StT≪1,  dispersed  particles  shortly
approach  the  continuous  phase  temperature.  But  when  StT≫1,  a
considerable relative temperature between particles and the continuous
phase will be observed. τT  is given as follows [142]:

models offered in the literature will be discussed and then a roadmap
will be proposed to guide researchers to the most appropriate mathe-
matical approach that should be used under certain conditions to result
in accurate predictions.

2.2.2.1. Eulerian single-phase homogeneous model. Although a colloidal
suspension  is  inherently  composed  of  two  different  phases,  it  can  be
treated  as  a  single-phase  homogeneous  mixture,  i.e.  nanoparticles
exhibit a homogeneous and uniform distribution in the base fluid, under
certain conditions. If the suspension is dilute (i.e., fV < 6.5% for solar
nanofluids  [143])  with  small-size  particles  and  low  St  (i.e.,  < 0.1),
dispersed  particles  act  as  fluid  tracers  and  will  be  in  momentum  and
thermal equilibria with no velocity or temperature slips. Also, particle
interactions and collisions will not have a considerable effect on the flow
hydrodynamics and heat transfer of the dispersion. Then, the Eulerian
single-phase  homogeneous  model  is  applicable.  This  model  is  the
simplest and most widely used in the literature in DASC investigations. It
treats the suspension as a homogeneous mixture with unique effective
thermophysical  attributes  depending  on  those  of  the  suspension  con-
stituents  and  fV.  However,  it  was  observed  that  several  DASC  studies
simply use the base fluid attributes rather than effective ones arguing
that  solar  nanofluids  employ  negligibly  small  fV  values  [28,136,
144–146].  But  for  higher-accuracy  predictions  using  the  fully  contin-
uous single-phase model, the effective nanofluid thermophysical prop-
erties  are  given  in  the  literature  based  on  several  correlations.  The
effective density of the nanofluid (ρeff ) is given based on the theory of
mixing as [147]:

ρeff

=

(cid:0)

1 (cid:0)

)
ρf

fV

+ fVρp

(37)

Theoretical ρeff  values exhibited good agreement with experimental
ones [148]. The effective heat capacity of the nanofluid (Ceff ) is obtained
based on the theory of mixing assuming thermal equilibrium between
the particles and base fluid by Xuan and Roetzel [149]:

Ceff =

(cid:0)

1 (cid:0)

)
ρf Cf + fVρpCp

(38)

Also, several techniques were followed in the literature to calculate
the  nanofluid  effective  viscosity  (μeff )  as  a  function  of  fV  based  on
empirical correlations or numerically based on Taylor series expansion
[150]. The Brinkman’s formula is given as follows [150]:

μeff

Maxwell presented a correlation for a solid-fluid suspension and then
it was justified by Buongiorno et al. [151] to be used for the nanofluid’s
effective thermal conductivity (keff ) calculations:

Correlations  for  μeff  and  keff  are  given  in  the  literature  with  more
details accounting for the temperature and dispersed particle size and
shape  effects. However,  we selected  the  relations  above  for  DASC  in-
vestigations as they are generic (i.e., not limited to specific nanoparticle
types) and simple (as fV  is very tiny in solar nanofluids).

Accordingly,  the  continuity,  momentum,  and  energy  equations  to
solve for the space-averaged velocity (um) and temperature (Tm) of the
homogeneous  single-phase  solid-liquid  Newtonian  mixture  are  given
based on the single-phase model, respectively, as follows:

+ Sva

(43)

where Sva  represents the source term in the energy equation. In case of
DASC systems, Sva  represents the volumetric solar radiation absorption
within the working fluid, which is the negative divergence of the total
radiative heat flux as explained earlier. In solar nanofluids, the particles
are exceedingly small in both size and spatial occupation. Consequently,
the velocity and temperature of the dispersed particles closely align with
the  corresponding  fluid  values.  This  equivalence,  however,  does  not
hold when dispersed particles are larger. But since solar nanofluids are
highly  dilute  and  exhibit  a  macroscopic  appearance  akin  to  homoge-
neous fluids, and considering that their thermophysical attributes have
been calculated using this model, the homogeneous model stands as a
preferable choice for solar nanofluid applications. The accuracy of this
set  of  governing  equations  is  deemed  acceptable  as  it  encompasses
conservation laws, with the exception being non-Newtonian nanofluids.
The boundary conditions applied to Eqs. 41–43 are same as those for the
fluid (i.e., no penetration, no slip, and equal temperature). Given the
highly dilute nature of solar nanofluids and the infrequent particle-wall
collisions, these boundary conditions offer accurate representations of
nanofluids. It is reasonable to assert that comprehensive information for
employing computational models in nanofluids is available and highly
accurate. Consequently, the justified use of the homogeneous model in
solar nanofluid applications is anticipated to yield sufficiently accurate
results.

On the other hand, the single-phase homogeneous model relies on
the average attributes of the mixture, offering insights solely into these
averages. It cannot capture any differences between the dispersed par-
ticles and base fluid. Moreover, due to the uniform particle distribution
assumption, it cannot address inquiries such as the relative velocity of
particles, particle distribution and migration impacts, or the impact of
particle  aggregation  on  the  performance  of  the  nanofluid.  Bahiraei
[152]  inferred  that  contradictions,  observed  in  the  literature,  in  the
nanofluid  performance  predictions  are  attributed  to  overlooking  the
particle migration impacts and ignoring the velocity and temperature
slips between dispersed particles and the host fluid. This is due to the
implicit assumption in the single-phase homogeneous model that there
is no momentum or energy exchange between the solid and fluid phases
and there are momentum and thermal equilibria between them. These
limitations drove researchers to rather use different approaches to pro-
vide more details on the nanofluid performance and deep justifications
for its behavior.

2.2.2.2. Eulerian-Eulerian  two-fluid  model. The  Eulerian-Eulerian  two-
fluid  model  is  the  most  common  two-phase  modeling  approach  in
nanofluid investigations [153]. It treats both the dispersed particles and
base fluid as two different interpenetrating continua coexisting in the
same volume. Each continuum is separately governed by its mass, mo-
mentum, and energy conservation equations. Interactions between the
two continua are represented by additional terms (i.e., source terms),
incorporated  into  the  respective  governing  equations.  For  instance,  a
force term accounting for the drag imposed on the base fluid by particles
is included in the momentum equation. Conservation equations for the
base  fluid  encompass  terms  representing  hydrodynamic  forces  at  the
solid–fluid phases interface; and energy transfer from the solid to fluid
phases. Empirical closure equations are then used to individually model
these terms. Applied to Newtonian fluids, the comprehensive equation
set for the Eulerian-Eulerian model is outlined as follows.

The force term (Fi) represents hydrodynamic interactions between
particulate and continuous phases, including drag and lift forces. The
heat  source term  (q) accounts  for the  total  enthalpy  transfer  per  unit
volume  from  solid  to  fluid  phases,  and  Sva  represents  the  volumetric
solar  radiation  absorption  within  the  nanofluid  given  as  the  negative
divergence of the total radiative heat flux. The pressure term (Pc) reflects
the impact of particle collisions, often negligible in nanofluids as they
are insignificant. Transport properties for the particulate phase (kp) and
(μp) should be defined. They are either given using empirical formulas or
commonly assumed to be equal to those of the base fluid.

Regarding the initial and boundary conditions employed in such a
modeling  framework,  uniform  velocity,  fV,  and  temperature  distribu-
tions can serve as inlet boundary and initial conditions. At the outlet
boundary, a zero field of relative pressure, zero temperature-gradient,
and  uniform  fV  distribution  are  specified  [154].  Following  the
approach of Otanicar et al. [34], heat loss is considered from the upper
surface only, with a prescribed heat transfer coefficient, while the bot-
tom wall is insulated. Although the no-slip condition is conventionally
applied to solid walls as a reliable condition for fluids, it is not neces-
sarily the appropriate boundary condition for the solid phase. Indeed,
numerous  experimental  and  detailed  Direct  Numerical  Simulation
(DNS) studies have demonstrated significant slip of the particulate phase
at solid boundaries. The slip behavior of solid-phase Partial Differential
Equations  (PDEs)  is  determined  by  closure  equations  derived  from
experimental  data  or  more  comprehensive  DNS  computations  that
establish the slip behavior of the particulate phase based on the funda-
mental first principles [155].

There are three Eulerian-Eulerian approaches offered in the litera-
ture,  namely,  the  volume  of  fluid  (VOF),  mixture,  and  Eulerian  ap-
proaches. These approaches are detailed in a review by Biharaei [156].
It is essential to mention that in order for the particulate phase to be
deemed  as  a  continuum  and  thus  the  Eulerian-Eulerian  approach  is
applicable, it is imperative that the mean inter-particle distance (Lp(cid:0) p) is
sufficiently smaller than the computational cell resolution (Lp(cid:0) p≪ Δx).
This means that each computational cell should contain a considerable
number  of  particles.  However,  for  solar  nanofluids,  characterized  by
dilution  and  extensive  inter-particle  distances,  this  condition  imposes
stringent  constraints  on  the  resolvable  fluid  characteristics.  Conse-
quently, the notable simplicity of the single-phase homogeneous model
renders it a preferable approach over the Eulerian-Eulerian one for solar
nanofluid investigations.

However, even if the use of the Eulerian-Eulerian approach is justi-
fied in terms of the problematic particulate phase continuum condition,
the discrete nature of the disperse phase is still overlooked. This means

that  this  approach  fails  to  provide  details  on  particle  dispersion,  ag-
gregation, trajectories, and spatial distribution, effects of particle shape
and  size  (where  particles  of  different  sizes  are  deemed  as  different
phases [142]), and particle-particle and particle–wall interactions. The
Eulerian-  Eulerian  approach  rather  offers  a  statistical  averaged
description for the velocity and concentration of particulate phase as a
function of space and time. Hence, there exists a critical necessity for a
multi-scale modeling approach that can effectively capture the discrete
nature of dispersed particles to shed light on the aforementioned phys-
ical phenomena while maintaining computational feasibility.

2.2.2.3. Eulerian-Lagrangian  model. The  continuous  base  fluid  in  this
approach is treated from the Eulerian modeling perspective. However,
dispersed  particles  are  studied  from  the  Lagrangian  perspective.  The
Lagrangian  approach  is  intuitively  and  physically  justified  when  the
suspension is dilute (fV < 6.5% [143]) and dispersed particles are small
and discrete. In contrast to conventional fully-continuous models, fully
discrete or hybrid continuous-discrete techniques offer the capability to
account for the discrete nature of nanoparticles. Such an approach en-
ables the accurate modeling of intricate physical phenomena, encom-
passing  temperature  and  velocity  slips  between  the  continuous  and
particulate  phases,  suspensions  involving  multiple  particle  types,
non-uniformities in particle spatial distribution, interactions involving
collisions between particles, lateral migration of particles, interactions
with  and  deposition  onto  surfaces,  individual  particle  position  and
residence time, impacts stemming from particle size distribution, par-
ticle aggregation, considerations of non-spherical particles, and turbu-
lent diffusion.

Due  to  the  high  computational  cost  associated  with  fully  discrete
modeling methods, such as MD and SPH, the Eulerian-Lagrangian model
is preferable since it offers the ability to capture the physical phenomena
mentioned  above  at  a  relatively  low  computational  cost.  Interactions
between  fluid  and  particulate  phases  (i.e.,  particle-fluid  and  particle-
particle  interactions)  determine  the  forces  individually  applied  to  a
particle  in  the  flow.  These  interactions  are  called  coupling  between
phases. The degree of coupling determines to what extent the model is
capable  of  accommodating  these  phenomena  effectively.  In  one-way
coupling, only the  fluid phase  can influence the  particulate one. This
(cid:0) 3 [142]),
is acceptable when the suspension is ultra-dilute with (fV < 10
where the space that particles occupy is sufficiently small to neglect the
forces that particles may exert on the fluid phase. In two-way coupling,
both phases can mutually influence each other. This occurs when the
(cid:0) 1  [142]),  where  particles
(cid:0) 3 > fV > 10
volume  fraction  is  higher  (10
occupy a greater volume and the forces they exert on the continuous
phase can no longer be ignored. The particle force source terms are then
involved in the continuous phase momentum equation and applied in
the control volume in which particles are moving through the time step.
In three-way coupling, disturbances caused by a particle in the contin-
uous phase can affect another particle. In four-way coupling, the model
takes  into  account  the  particle-particle  and  particle-wall  interactions
[157]. This occurs when the suspension is highly dense, where collisions
between particles and other frictional contacts become too important to
be  neglected.  But
the
Eulerian-Lagrangian model becomes impractical as too many particles
then need to be tracked, requiring extremely high computational cost.
The Eulerian-Eulerian model would rather be preferable to treat such
dense suspensions.

suspension  flows,

in  highly  dense

In  the  Eulerian-Lagrangian  approach,  the  particles  being  tracked
could  either be  actual particles  governed  by  deterministic  soft-sphere
collision models, known as the discrete element approach, or compu-
tational parcels representing a group of real particles with hard-sphere
collision  models,  referred  to  as  the  discrete  parcel  approach.  The
discrete element approach finds common usage in highly dense granular
flows (i.e., the flow of grains or particles, such as sand, or powders, in a
manner distinct from conventional fluid flow) featuring relatively large

particle sizes, such as fluidized beds [158], where interactions with the
fluid are often negligible. A fluidized bed refers to a condition wherein
solid  particles  exhibit  fluid-like  behavior.  This  state  is  attained  by
introducing a gas or liquid upwards through the particles at a velocity
sufficient to overcome their weight. Consequently, the force exerted by
the fluid balances the particles’  weight, allowing them to remain sus-
pended  and move freely. While the appearance may resemble that of
boiling  liquid,  it  is  essentially  a  blend  of  fluid  and  solid  particles.
However,  for  nano-sized  particles,  employing  the  discrete  element
approach  becomes  computationally  impractical,  limited  to  very  small
domains with a restricted number of particles and short simulation time
intervals [159].

In the Eulerian-Lagrangian approach, two description strategies are

available: the point-source modeling and resolved particle modeling.

-  The Lagrangian Point-source model

Dispersed  particles  in  the  Lagrangian  point-source  modeling  are
addressed as discrete points moving in the flow domain as sources of
mass, momentum, and energy for the fluid. They are tracked individu-
ally based on Newton’s second law considering that the center of co-
ordinates  is  at  the  particle  center  of  gravity.  The  Lagrangian  point-
source  model  is  preferable  as  it  offers  ordinary  differential  equations
(ODEs) representing the motion and energy exchange of particles with
the continuous phase. These equations can be integrated to determine
the trajectory of a particle and the temperature profile. The force bal-
ance  and  energy  equation  that  govern  a  particle  are,  respectively,  as
follows:

(51)

Mp  is the particle mass. The summation of forces in the force balance
(Eq. (50)) involves the body force (FB), surface force (FS) which includes
the  lift,  steady  drag,  history,  and  added  mass  forces,  and  collision  or
other  interaction  forces  with  the  boundaries  or  other  particles  (FC).
 ̇
Similarly,  when  accounting  for  the  overall  heat  transfer  (
Q)  between
phases,  both  the  steady-state  and  the  history  terms  must  be  incorpo-
rated. The overall heat transfer should include the source term repre-
sented  by the  volumetric heat absorption. The angular momentum of
particles becomes physically meaningless due to the assumption deem-
ing dispersed particles as points moving in the flow domain.

As for the boundary conditions for the Lagrangian phase, an outflow
periodic boundary condition is applied, where a nanoparticle exiting the
outlet is reintroduced at the inlet with a randomized y-location, while its
position, y-velocity, and temperature are reset to zero, and its x-velocity
is  set  to  the inlet velocity.  In contrast, for  the particle-wall boundary
condition, a particle can either adhere to or rebound from the wall upon
collision, with the resulting velocity determined by the particle’s kinetic
energy and the interaction potential between the particle and the wall
[85]. As for the boundary conditions of the continuous phase flow, they
are same as conventional ones used in the single-phase homogeneous
approach.

The  prerequisites  for  the  validity  of  the  point-particle  assumption
encompass: characteristics of rigid particles, Dp≪Δx, low particle Rey-
nolds  number  (Rep),  and  low  fV  [160],  and  particularly  in  turbulent
flows, the particles should be notably smaller than the smallest turbu-
lence scale [161]. The condition (Dp≪Δx) ensures that particles expe-
rience  exceedingly  weak  gradients  in  the  continuous  phase  over  the
length scale associated with their diameters, allowing the local ambient
flow around a particle to be reasonably deemed as uniform [162]. When
(Dp ∼ Δx), the undisturbed fluid velocity at the particle’s location sub-
stantially  deviates  from  the  fluid  velocity  perturbed  by  the  feedback

force from the particle [162]. Furthermore, a reduction in fluid volume
becomes apparent in the Eulerian cell containing a particle.

For moderate and dense suspensions (fV > 6.5 %), the influence of
particle  collisions becomes  significant in shaping particle  trajectories.
Basic deterministic collision models derived from fundamental princi-
ples, including conservation of momentum and partial mechanical en-
ergy  dissipation  during  the  collision,  prove  inadequate  in  accurately
depicting  particle  interactions,  particularly  in  flows  involving  non-
spherical  particles  and  particles  of  varying  sizes.  Consequently,
various  probabilistic  collision  models  have  been  introduced  and  are
presently applied to address these complexities.

The Lagrangian point-source model stands out for its robustness, ease
of implementation, and accuracy in scenarios where particle motion and
energy exchange minimally impact the fluid’s velocity and temperature
fields. A specialized application of this model is found in Monte Carlo
(MC)  simulations,  originally  devised  to  investigate  the  influence  of
turbulence  and  time-varying  velocity  and  temperature  fields  on  the
trajectories of both coarse and fine particles. In MC simulations, initial
Eulerian  computations  solve  for  the  average  host  fluid  velocity  and
temperature  fields,  assuming  an  absence  of  particles.  Subsequently,  a
probabilistic methodology is employed to represent fluid velocity and
temperature fluctuations, typically sampled from a random distribution.
A  multitude  of  particles  is  introduced  into  the  flow  field,  and  their
momentum and heat exchange with the host fluid are determined using
Eqs.  50  and  51.  Consequently,  ensemble  averages  for  variables  of  in-
terest  (e.g.,  velocity,  temperature,  and  spatial  distribution)  are
computed for the entire particle ensemble in the flow field. In line with
the ergodic hypothesis, these ensemble averages are deemed equivalent
to the time averages of the corresponding variables for the entire particle
set.

A  notable  limitation  of  the  simple  MC  simulations  lies  in  their
inherent  neglect  of  the  impact  of  particles  on  fluid  velocity  and  tem-
perature  fields,  along  with  the  interactions  among  particles.  Conven-
tionally  applying  this  method  results  in  a  one-way  coupling  model,
restricting  its  accuracy  to  dilute  suspension  flows.  Consequently,  the
results derived from MC simulations are only qualitatively representa-
tive  of  the  average  particle  behavior  in  moderate  and  dense  flows  or
regions anticipating higher particle loadings, such as stagnation areas
with  particle  accumulation.  While  MC  simulations  are  anticipated  to
yield accurate descriptions for very dilute nanofluids, their efficacy di-
minishes in cases involving more complex particle-fluid interactions.

-  The Lagrangian resolved particle model

The Lagrangian resolved-particle model is the model utilized in DNS
of  particles.  Within  this  model,  the  detailed  resolution  of  governing
equations for continuous-phase velocity and temperature fields occurs in
the presence of particles. This facilitates the determination of particle-
fluid  interactions  from  fundamental  principles,  eliminating  the  need
for empirical closure equations like drag and convective heat transfer
coefficients.  Notably,  the  computational  cell  resolution  of  the  contin-
uous phase in this model, unlike the point-source model, is considerably
smaller than the particle size (Δx≪Dp). Due to the dense computational
mesh,  the  resolved-particle  model  demands  significantly  greater
computational resources for equivalent particle numbers and sizes than
its counterpart. Consequently, the use of this model for large engineer-
ing systems with a multitude of discrete particles is constrained.

Solutions of the continuous phase governing equations provide in-
formation about the pressure, velocity, and temperature profiles of the
fluid  surrounding  each  particle.  By  integrating  the  shear  stress,  and
temperature gradient profiles over the particle surface (As), the hydro-
dynamic surface force, and rate of heat transfer between particulate and
continuous phases can be evaluated using Eqs. 52 and 53, respectively:

to particulate phases is:

The primary benefit of the Lagrangian resolved particle model lies in
its  independence  from  empirical  closure  equations  governing  fluid-
particle interactions, as these interactions are determined from funda-
mental principles. The only needed empirical input is confined to par-
ticle–particle  interactions  and  particle–wall  collisions,  which  are
infrequent in solar nanofluids. Additionally, a secondary advantage of
the resolved-particle model, shared with the point-source model, is its
flexibility to employ various well-established models for the continuous
phase, including FDM, FEM, DNS, and LBM.

On the other hand, because it is extremely computationally expen-
sive to resolve the surface stresses (i.e., shear stress and pressure fields)
and flow features at the particle interface, the resolved-particle model is
only applicable to simple flows containing a single particle or very dilute
suspensions  containing  notably  large-size  particles.  This  is  extremely
unfeasible for nanofluid systems where a large number of nanoparticles
need to be tracked.

Although the very low fV  is a common condition for the use of the
Eulerian-Lagrangian approach, it can be simply extended to model dense
suspensions.  However,  an  inherent  limitation  of  this  model  lies  in  its
demand for substantial memory and computational cost. The consider-
able multitude of nanoparticles as well as the low St introduce numerical
stiffness that requires small time steps. This need arises due to stability
requisites in explicit numerical techniques and in the implicit ones for
accurate  particle  drift  computation.  Consequently,  the  Eulerian-
Lagrangian  model  is  considered  impractical  for  dense  suspension
flows.  Moreover,  the  continuous  phase  equations  generally  do  not
incorporate considerations for the volume occupied by dispersed parti-
cles.

2.2.2.4. A  guiding  roadmap  to  the  appropriate  macroscale  approach.
Recent research stated that nanofluids with fV  below 0.1 % are classified
as very dilute mixtures, where interparticle forces can be disregarded,
assuming  no  adhesive  forces  are  present  [163].  As  such,  and  when

ultra-small  particles,  whose  volume  does  not  affect  the  continuous
phase, the Eulerian single-phase approach can be used to model such
nanofluid systems. In contrast, nanofluids with fV  exceeding 0.1 % are
further  classified  into  collision-dominated,  when  collisions  between
particles affect the nanofluid behavior at intermediate volume fractions,
and contact-dominated, when nanoparticles experience contact rather
than  collisions  in  highly-dense  suspension  flows.  Particle-particle  in-
teractions are significant in collision-dominated nanofluid flows, when
collisions are too frequent to be neglected. This necessitates the use of
the  Eulerian-Lagrangian  approach  to  capture  the  discrete  nature  of
nanoparticles  and  account  for  the  effects  of  particle-particle  and
particle-fluid interactions on the nanofluid performance as previously
discussed. However, when the nanofluid is highly dense with fV > 10%
(contact-dominated), the use of the Eulerian-Lagrangian approach be-
comes  impractical  since  detecting  such  a  huge  number  of  collisions
demand  an  unfeasibly  high  computational  cost.  Consequently,  the
Eulerian-Eulerian approach is recommended whereupon. Also, in case of
a dilute suspension with large-size nanoparticles, the Eulerian-Eulerian
approach is recommended since the effect of the nanoparticle volume on
the continuous phase cannot be neglected. Fig. 12 represents a guiding
roadmap  for  researchers  to  select  the  most  appropriate  approach  for
real-world nanofluid simulations at the macroscale level at given con-
ditions of fV, Dp, and St.

2.2.2.5. Fully  discrete  approaches. Although  matter  is  made  up  of
discrete atoms and molecules, most science and engineering systems are
amenable to the continuum hypothesis under a certain size scale. The
justification  for  the  continuum  hypothesis  validity  does  not  originate
from specific physical or mathematical principles; instead, it is deduced
from  the  absence  of  conflicts  between  the  resulting  continuum
description  of  materials  and  empirical  observations.  Indeed,  the  con-
tinuum theory finds support in all existing empirical data for physical
systems containing a sufficiently large number of molecules to be treated
as continua [143]. However, if the volume of space wherein a material is
placed is arbitrarily small, an atom or subatomic particles constituting
the  atom might or  might not be existent  within this space. Then, the
uncertainty  principle  may  be  recalled  to  investigate  the  presence  of
matter within such a tiny volume using quantum mechanics and could
be  further  treated  using  statistical  mechanics  to  derive  a  probability

density function.

Consequently,  when  the  system  under  investigation  is  sufficiently
small to include a few molecules, the continuum theory is not applicable
and different modeling approaches should be used such as the MD, DPD,
and  LBM.  Such  modeling  methods  are  fully  discrete  and  use  the
Lagrangian equations to accommodate the discrete nature of dispersed
phases, and thus capture the interactions and phenomena and answer
the  questions  that  continuum-hypothesis-based  approaches  cannot.
Fig.  11  Demonstrates  positions  of  the  mathematical  approaches  dis-
cussed in this work with regard to the length and time scales. For large
scales, macroscopic-level investigations can be conducted based on the
continuum  Navier-Stokes  Equations  (NSEs)  whose  solutions  can  be
provided utilizing computational techniques such as the FDM [34,46,57,
131], FVM [63,126–129], and FEM [41,130]. For ultra-small length and
time scales, the continuum hypothesis is broken down, and MD simu-
lations  are  necessary  to  investigate  such  micro/nanoscale  systems.
When the time and length scales are less than the continuum hypothesis
threshold and larger than MD scales, mesoscale approaches such as the
LBM, DPD, and SPH are recommended.

-  Molecular dynamics

In  nanofluid  systems,  the  breakdown  of  continuum  assumptions
becomes notable when dealing with extremely small length scale (≤ 10
nm) [164], namely, when the length scale of the fluidic system is in the
same range as the mean free path (i.e., Kn ≥ 1). Such scales in nanofluid
flows are too small to use the continuum assumption for simulations,
which necessitates transitioning to the atomic scale through MD simu-
lations.  MD  simulations  are  based  on  computing  the  forces  acting  on
each molecule due to its interactions with neighboring ones and with
system  boundaries.  Each  molecule  is  treated  as  a  separate  particle,
which follows Newton’s second law in response to the force system. By
numerically solving the motion equations for all molecules, MD simu-
lations  reveal  how  the  whole  system  of  molecules  behaves  under  the
driving  forces. The average behavior  of the  molecules provides infor-
mation  on  the  macroscopic  process  of  interest  [165].  The  governing
equation of a molecule movement is given as follows:

Mi

d2ri
dt2

= Fai + Fbi + Fci + Fdi

(54)

Mi and ri are the mass and position vector of the i-th molecule or particle
at time t, respectively. The forces on the right hand side, Fai, Fbi, Fci  and
Fdi,  represent  the  intermolecular  forces  applied  by  other  neighboring
molecules in the computational domain, forces applied by wall bound-
aries, constraint forces, and driving forces, respectively. The force Fai  is
usually given by the sum of the effects of potential functions that cause
forces, like gravity and electrostatic or atomic interaction potentials. For
the latter, the interaction forces between two molecules or particles (i
and j) are often modeled by the Lennard-Jones potential function [166]:

(55)

where ε  and Γ  are the bonding energy and distance, respectively. The
force  Fbi  signifies  the  impact  of  boundary  molecules  on  the  molecule
movement  within  the  computational  domain.  As  Fbi  embodies  inter-
molecular forces, its typical expression can be given in the form of Eq.
(55) with different constants, ε  and Γ. In the examination of homoge-
neous systems, the assumption is made that the system extends infinitely
in all directions (using the so-called periodic boundary condition), and
an MD study is conducted on a small part of this extended system. The
MD study, then, investigates the interactions and behavior of a limited
number  of  molecules  within  a  domain  representing  a  fraction  of  the
homogeneous  fluid.  Periodic  boundary  conditions  are  applied  in  this
scenario,  ensuring  that  when  a  molecule  exits  the  computational

boundary,  an  identical  molecule  enters  from  the  opposite  boundary,
resulting  in  a  net  vanishing  boundary  force.  The  incorporation  of
constraint and driving forces signifies a departure from pure Newtonian
mechanics. The constraint force prevents abnormal energy levels in the
molecular  system,  aligning  with  Gauss’s  principle  of  minimum
constraint  [143].  The  force  is  mathematically  expressed  through  a
closure equation, analogous to the friction equation as:

Fci = ζFMivi

(56)

ζF  is the Gauss friction coefficient. It possesses both positive and nega-
tive values and typically exhibits time-dependent variation. In equilib-
rium  conditions,  its  time-averaged  value  is  zero.  As  the  system
approaches thermodynamic equilibrium, ζF becomes proportional to the
potential energy’s rate of change within the system.

Describing  non-equilibrium  gradients  at  the  molecular  level  poses
challenges when dealing with continua. The introduction of a driving
force (Fdi) serves as a tool to model these gradients and investigate the
resulting  transport  processes  arising  from  non-equilibrium  velocity,
temperature, or concentration gradients. As it is unfeasible to directly
measure these forces at the molecular scale, the selection of appropriate
forces  relies  on  insights  from  MD  simulations  and  their  validation
through  experimental  data.  The  driving  force  is  determined,  demon-
strating its effectiveness when employing weights (Wi) for the compu-
tation of space- or time-averaged variables, such as the average particle
velocity (vp):

Reviews [167,168] comprehensively covered recent MD simulation
advances in systems employing nanofluids, addressing aspects such as
nanofluid thermophysical properties, thermal wall modeling, etc. These
reviews  provided  critical  insights  and  identified  essential  areas  for
future  research.  MD  has  been  applied  in  various  nanofluid  in-
vestigations,  exploring  heat  transfer  characteristics,  studying  surface
nanostructures, and investigating chaotic movements of nanoparticles.
Furthermore,  Wei  et  al.  [169]  highlighted  that  molecular  motion,
particularly  without  a  temperature  gradient,  plays  a  key  role  in  low
viscous heat transfer  as revealed by non-equilibrium MD simulations.
Also, using the LAMMPS code, Toghraie et al. [170] successfully utilized
MD to simulate Poiseuille flow in a hybrid platinum/copper nanofluid,
where atomic interactions are governed by the Lennard–Jones potential.
While  MD  simulations  can  accurately  depict  the  separation-
dependent  potential  of  mean  force  among  particles,  their  highly
demanding  computational  costs  make  them  entirely  not  feasible  for
nanofluid systems characterized by a large number of dispersed particles
and diverse length and time scales. Consequently, MD investigations of
particulate flows are confined to oversimplified systems such as those
with  Argon  host  fluids  and  very  dilute  suspensions.  However,  these
systems do not accurately represent or mimic the real-world conditions
encountered in solar nanofluid applications.

-  Dissipative particle dynamics (DPD)

Despite the detailed insights provided by MD, its high computational
cost limits its applicability for modeling macroscopic system properties
at the scale of real-world applications, given the substantial number of
particles and ultra-short time scales involved, even with the top-of-the-

line supercomputers. Nonetheless, when considering the length and time
scales  relevant  to  energy  transfer  in  nanofluids,  these  fall  within  the
intermediate  range  between  continuum  and  MD  scales,  commonly
referred to as ’mesoscales’. Effectively capturing these mesoscales can
be achieved through a technique known as ’coarse graining’ of particles,
where each coarse-grained particle represents a sizable cluster of actual
particles  or  fluid  molecules.  Therefore,  analyzing  heat  transfer  in
nanofluids  stands  to  gain  valuable  insights  by  leveraging  mesoscale
coarse-grained models to mimic microscopic insights of energy transfer
between the dispersed particles and host medium particles/molecules.
These methods efficiently model relatively bulk physical systems while
capturing essential interaction details within fluid molecules. A notable
recent coarse-grained approach of this kind is the DPD technique, which
was  found  far  more  feasible  than  MD  techniques  with  regard  to
computational time.

The  DPD  serves  as  a  coarse-grained  alternative  method  to  MD,
wherein  each  DPD  particle  corresponds  to  a  set  of  actual  molecules.
These  DPD  particles  are  distributed  randomly  throughout  the  flow
domain, adhering to mass, momentum, and energy conservation prin-
ciples. The DPD method was applied to various heat transfer techniques,
encompassing  conduction,  convection,  and  natural  convection  with
fluid attributes varying with temperature. Thereafter, Abu-Nada [171,
172]  further  developed  the  DPD  methodology  for  simulating  heat
transfer  in  nanofluids.  The  approach  successfully  replicated  energy
transfer processes by analyzing thermal fluctuations driven by Brownian
motion.  Additionally,  the  method  explored  the  inter-particle  energy
exchange  between  adjacent  fluid  particles  [173].  Findings  suggested
that the DPD method is aptly applicable to nano/microscale systems and
holds potential for extension to diverse practical heat transfer systems.
Further details on the mathematical formulation of the DPD approach
are available in the literature [164,171,172].

The  DPD  method  demonstrates  advantages  over  conventional
methods  in  terms  of  its  applicability  to  multiphase  flows,  straightfor-
ward extension from 2D to 3D, and capability for modeling inter-particle
interactions at the microscopic level, incorporating both attractive and
repulsive forces between fluid molecules and the surrounding media. On
the other hand, this method suffers from some limitations including the
absence  of  a  direct  link  between  DPD  parameters  and  the  system’s
physical ones, as thermophysical properties are not input parameters to
the  DPD model, but they are outputs  of the  simulation. This requires
tuning  of  the  microscopic  DPD  numerical  parameters  (conservative,
dissipative,  and  random)  to  match  the  macroscopic  thermophysical
properties of the real systems. Additionally, the computational cost of
the method is high in comparison with the FDM and FVM.

For the mathematical formulation of the DPD approach, a multitude
of coarse-grained DPD particles are dispersed throughout the flow re-
gion to simulate the nanofluid. The motion and interactions among these
nanofluid  DPD  particles  are  described,  employing  the  Boussinesq
approximation to account for buoyancy forces, as follows [171]:

-  Lattice Boltzmann method (LBM)

The  LBM  is  apt  for  addressing  phenomena  occurring  in  nanofluid
systems  wherein  particle-fluid  and  particle-particle  interactions  are
significant. This method uniquely incorporates MD techniques to bridge
the gap between microscopic and macroscopic perspectives. It smoothly
integrates the microscopic interactions between fluid particles with the
numerical model. In contrast to the NSEs, which capture the flow dy-
namics at the macroscale, the LBM is powerful at addressing interactions
of fluid particles, providing insights into the mesoscale mechanisms of
the  flow  dynamics.  In  this  approach,  conservation  equations  are
resolved  by  discretizing  the  Boltzmann  transport  equation  on  a  grid
lattice by presuming that “artificial particles”  that are mesoscopically
positioned over the lattices and distributed according to the probability
distribution  function  f(x, ξ, t) [174,175].  This  density  distribution
function  characterizes  the  number  density  of  dispersed  nanoparticles
with  the  microscopic  speed  (ξ)  at  the  location  (x)  and  time  (t).  The
computational domain is discretized into a lattice that encompasses the
entire  geometry.  The  discrete  lattice  is  employed  to  represent  spatial
variations and discrete time, creating distinct nodes for the host fluid
and dispersed particles. The fluid-particle interactions are stipulated at
boundary nodes or link joints proximate to these nodes. The LBM is used
as  a  particle  probability distribution  function,  offering  a  robust  alter-
native numerical method to conventional macroscopic approaches that
discretize governing equations, like NSEs. This method features a par-
allel feature, allowing for fast implementation for complicated geome-
tries. Furthermore, its computational time and cost are notably reduced
compared  to  microscopic  methods,  rendering  it  an  appealing  choice
across various fields, particularly in addressing heat and fluid flow is-
sues. The LBM equations for a multi-component system for nanofluids
are detailed in Xuan and Yao [174] work. The discretized form of the

the number of speeds allocated to each particle at a lattice point, indi-
cating the permissible directions for particle movement within the lat-
tice  domain  [176].  D3Q19  and  D3Q41  lattices  are  the  most  commonly
used  models  employed  for  3D  simulations  [164].  Fig.  13  shows  the
schematic of  D3Q19  lattice. Following  the determination of  the lattice
arrangement, the lattice Boltzmann equations governing flow dynamics
and heat transfer are then solved.

Using  the  Taylor  expansion  technique,  the  discrete  Boltzmann
equation can be derived from Eq. (65). A nanofluid refers to a mixture
comprising  nanoparticles and  a base  liquid, denoted  by σ = 1, 2.  As
emphasized by Wolf-Gladrow [178], the lattice Boltzmann model con-
sists of a lattice structure, an equilibrium distribution function, and a
kinetic  equation  known  as  the  lattice  Boltzmann  equation  (LBE).

ation,  various  lattice  configurations  can  be  chosen.  Consequently,
several types of multi-speed lattice Boltzmann models have been pro-
posed in the literature. For 2D scenarios, the widely utilized D2Q9 model
is prominent. This model, employing a 2D octagonal lattice [178], in-
corporates nine discrete velocities, defined as follows:

c = Δx/Δt represents the reference lattice velocity, and the indices i = 1,
..., 4  and  i = 5, ..., 8  correspond  to  the  orthogonal  and  diagonal  di-
rections on the lattice, respectively. For the D2Q9  model, three distinct
types  of  particles  are  considered  at  lattice  site  (x)  and  time  (t):  the
equilibrium distribution is described by the distribution functions f0  for
the stationary particles, fi  (where i = 1, ..., 4) for particles moving in
orthogonal directions, and fi  (where i = 5, ..., 8) for particles moving
diagonally.

Selecting an appropriate equilibrium distribution function is crucial
to ensure that each component complies with the macroscale Navier-
Stokes  equations.  Specifically  for  the  standard  D2Q9  model,  the  equi-
librium state’s single-particle distribution functions are outlined as fol-

Relations between the macro-scale physical quantities of a nanofluid
flow  and  their  counterpart  in  the  micro-scale  level  such  as  the  mass
density and the σ-th component’s velocity can be found in Ref. [174].
For nanofluid simulations using the LBM, it is essential to examine
the  dynamic  factors  influencing  nanofluid  flow.  In  the  absence  of
external  fields,  nanoparticles  experience  buoyancy  and  gravitational
(FB), Brownian (FBr), and drag (FD) forces, as well as dispersion force
from  repulsive  potentials  (FA).  Dominance  of  FBr  may  lead  to  nano-
particle aggregation and cluster formation during random motion, while
a  dominant  repulsive  force  can  disrupt  clusters,  suppressing  particle
aggregation  [174].  Under  the  influence  of  gravitational  force,  nano-
particles tend to sediment, with larger clusters experiencing relatively
faster sedimentation.

FB  can  be  given,  knowing  that  the  parameter  a  represents  the
dispersed  particle  radius,  while  Δρʹ  denotes  the  difference  in  mass
density between dispersed particles and host fluid, as follows:

FB = (cid:0) 4

πa3gΔρ’

(70)

Knowing that Δu is the difference in velocity among dispersed par-

ticle and surrounding liquid, FD  is:

FD = (cid:0) 6πμf aΔu

(71)

FBr  represents  the  resultant  impacts  of  interactions  from  the  liquid
molecules around a particle. It is given based on the equilibrium state
wherein  the  dispersed  particle’s  kinetic  energy  is  evenly  divided  be-
tween  its  translational  modes.  Knowing  that  the  direction  of  FBr  is
random and Cr  is a random number satisfying the normal distribution,
FBr  can be given statistically over a time interval (Δt), as [86]:

Tf  is the base fluid temperature. kBTf  accounts for the thermal energy
generated by the irregular Brownian motion, and Δt is the time step. The
van der Waals attraction energy (GA) between two particles at a distance
(Lp(cid:0) p) from each other is given as follows:

resents the strength of the van der Waals interaction between particles or
between a particle and a wall. I.e., it reflects the attractiveness between
objects due to van der Waals forces, and depends on the refractive index
of the material used and dielectric function of the base fluid. The force
arising  from  the  interaction  potential  among  particles  located  in  the
neighboring lattice containing ni  particles within the D2Q9  model is:

The van der Waals interactions between particles and the Hamaker
constant will be discussed in more detail in a coming section. Knowing
that V is volume of a certain lattice and n is the number of particles it

In the domain of solar energy, LBM has been utilized in several studies
[181,182] to solve the RTE and a conduction-radiation model, respec-
tively. In a recent review [183], the existing literature on the utilization
of  LBM  in  the  context  of  solar  thermal  collectors  and  heat  transfer
modeling was surveyed. The review stated that the LBM has seen diverse
applications  in  recent  years  and  offers  several  advantages  over  con-
ventional  CFD techniques,  making  it  a  suitable  choice  for  conducting
both small and large-scale computations for solar collectors. These ad-
vantages  include  the  elimination  of  the  need  to  solve  coupled
pressure-velocity  equations,  a  straightforward  calculation  procedure
with ease in handling complex geometries and treating boundary con-
ditions,  simple  numerical  implementation,  compatibility  with  supple-
mentary methods for developing hybrid approaches to solve the RTEs,
and notable numerical stability and efficiency. In light of these benefits,
Siavashi et al. [184] introduced an in-house multi-relaxation time LBM
model, for the first time in the literature, to simulate a DASC employing
a water-SWCNT nanofluid. The model was validated against results by
Gorji  and  Ranjbar  [126]  and  obtained  very  strong  agreement  with  a
maximum deviation of 1.29 %.

According to Mahian et al. [164], the LBM exhibits several advan-
tages,  including  scalability,  stability,  and  compatibility  with  parallel
computing.  It  is  particularly  well-suited  for  handling  complicated  ge-
ometries, making it a preferred choice for simulations involving complex
shapes.  The  method  excels  in  calculating  multiphase  flows  and  finds
application in mesoscale scenarios, such as colloidal systems and fluid
flow through small pores in porous media. Additionally, LBM allows for
the incorporation of microscopic interactions between fluid molecules.

However,  certain
thermo-physical  attributes,  such  as  μ  and  k,  presents  challenges;  the
method’s reliance on a uniform grid hinders the straightforward treat-
ment  of  fine  gradients  near  boundaries, leading  to  computational  de-
mands  in  areas  like  shear  and  boundary  layers;  incorporating  bulk
viscosity  is  indirect  and  related  to  the  relaxation  time;  implementing
axisymmetric flows can be complex; and handling multiphase flows with
significant density variations poses challenges.

Np,  Mj,  and ρj  are  the  total  number  of  particles  in  the  domain  of  the
particle i, mass and density of the adjacent particle j, respectively. To
approximate a spatial derivative fi within the kernel framework, one can
insert the derivative into Eq. (79), apply the technique of integration by
parts,  and  disregard  the  boundary  conditions.  The  process  is  summa-
rized as follows [187]:

∂Wk,i(r)/∂rφ  is the spatial derivative of the particle i along the φ direc-
tion, where φ serves as the direction index iterating from 1 up to the total
number of spatial dimensions. The SPH method’s kernel approximation
for a field function’s derivative facilitates the computation of the spatial
gradient using the function’s values and the smoothing function’s de-
rivatives,  bypassing  the  need  for  the  function’s  own  derivatives.  Liu
et al. [188] have noted that such SPH kernel approximations of a field
function and its derivative maintain second-order accuracy within the
core domain. However, at the boundaries or interfaces, these approxi-
mations fall below first-order accuracy due to the limited approximation
domain, a phenomenon commonly known as the boundary deficiency in
standard  SPH  methodologies.  The  readers  are  advised  to  refer  to  the
review  [187]  to  look  into  the  mathematical  formulation  of  the
early-improved  and  corrective  SPH  approach  and  its  applications  in
different science and engineering areas.

Fig.  14  offers  approximate  assessments  for  the  mathematical  ap-
proaches discussed above and determines the scope of each based on the
flow type characterized by Knudsen number (Kn). Kn, which is the ratio
between the mean  free path and the characteristic length of the flow
system,  provides  numerical  values  assessing  the  flow  and  determines
whether the continuum hypothesis is valid. Fig. 14 also presents com-
parisons between the mathematical approaches in terms of the compu-
tational cost, the depth of the physical insight they introduce, and length
and time scales of the system.

2.3. Thermal energy and exergy analyses

The SPH is one of the oldest meshless particle methods used for CFD
simulations  of  Lagrangian  nature.  The  fundamental  concept  behind
meshless methods is to deliver accurate and stable numerical solutions
for  integrals  or  PDEs,  encompassing  a  variety  of  potential  boundary
conditions through an arbitrary distribution of nodes. The SPH method
is  based  on  converting  the  continuum  conservation  equations  that
govern the flow, specifically the NSEs, from PDEs to integral equations
through the utilization of an interpolation function that computes the
kernel of the flow variables at any given location. The SPH demonstrates
favorable outcomes in simulating particulate two-phase flows [185].

In the SPH technique, the primary PDEs are discretized through a
two-step  process  involving  kernel  and  particle  approximations.  For  a
given function (f) at a specific location or particle (i), the kernel esti-
mation is derived by multiplying f  with a smoothing kernel (Wk), fol-

To assess the thermal performance of a nanofluid-based DASC sys-
tem, a proper thermal analysis should be accomplished to evaluate the
performance criteria or indicators chosen for the system. While thermal
energy analysis provides valuable insights, it falls short in capturing the
full  picture.  Exergy  analysis  represents  a  powerful  tool  that  comple-
ments and enhances our understanding of such energy systems. Exergy is
the  amount  of  work  obtainable  when  a  substance  reaches  a  state  of
thermodynamic  equilibrium  with  the  natural  surroundings  through
reversible  processes,  interacting  only  with  the  components  of  nature.
This definition captures the system’s potential to perform useful work.
Exergy provides a deeper understanding of energy quality and the po-
tential  for  useful  work  within  a  system,  making  it  a  valuable  tool  in
thermodynamics and engineering.

Authors, in this section, propose some performance criteria, found in

the  literature,  to  evaluate  the  performance  of  DASC  systems.  The ab-
sorption  efficiency  (ηa)  describes  how  efficient  a  nanofluid  is  at  ab-
sorption  of incident solar radiation  (Qinc) while traveling through the
DASC:

conditions, the exergy balance of a DASC system can be expressed in rate
form as follows:

respectively, as follows:

(81)

(82)

Qinc = LW

L and W are the length and width of the collector, respectively. Ia and Iinc
are the spectral radiation heat flux absorbed and incident, respectively.
Another performance indicator is the thermal efficiency (ηth), which
is the ratio of the useful thermal power gain (Qu) effectively carried by
the nanofluid after flowing through the collector to the solar radiation
absorbed by the nanofluid (Qa), expressed as:

The  left-hand  side  parameter  (EXinc)  represents  the  rate  of  exergy
input to the DASC from the solar source. EXinc  can be estimated by the
product of Qinc and a well-established factor called the Petela-Landsberg-
Press factor [189]:

The Petela-Landsberg-Press factor, the expression between brackets
in  Eq.  (87),  in  the  context  of  radiative  processes,  is  a  dimensionless
parameter  analogous  to  the  Carnot  efficiency  for  heat  engines.  This
factor  quantifies  the  upper  limit  of  theoretical  work  extractable  from
solar  radiation.  Furthermore,  drawing  upon  the  work  of  Evola  and
Marletta [190], the recoverable exergy (EXu) can be given as the dif-
ference  in  the  working  fluid’s  exergy  content  between  the  collector
outlet and inlet. The mathematical expression for EXu  is provided based
on the Gouy-Stodola theorem [191] that gives the exergy carried by a
flowing fluid that experienced a temperature increase from Tin  to Tout:

ρnf , cp,nf , unf , Tnf,out(y), and Tnf ,in are the nanofluid’s density, specific heat
capacity, velocity field function, temperature field function at the col-
lector outlet, and temperature at the collector inlet, respectively. One
more performance indicator is the collector efficiency (ηІ), which rep-
resents  the  overall  first-law  DASC  efficiency.  It  is  obtained  by  the
multiplication of ηa  and ηth, as follows:

ηІ = ηaηth

(85)

Looking at the DASC through the lens of the first-law of thermody-
namics, ηІ  captures  how  well  it  performs overall.  This  considers  both
how  well  it  absorbs  light  (optically)  and  how  well  it  traps  heat
(thermally).

Let’s delve into the exergy analysis. When the effects of kinetic and
potential  energy  changes  are  neglected,  and  under  steady-state

It is crucial to acknowledge that the Petela-Landsberg-Press factor, as
implemented  in  Eq.  (87),  represents  the  maximum  achievable  work
under the assumption of undiluted direct solar radiation [192]. Conse-
quently, its application in this context serves as an approximation for
unconcentrated solar radiation, which typically encompasses a combi-
nation of direct and diffuse radiation components.

The  term  ’direct  beam  radiation’  signifies  solar  radiation  that im-
pinges upon the Earth’s surface in a straight-line path originating from
the  sun.  Diffuse  radiation,  in  contrast,  describes  sunlight  that  has

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience103(2024)10116023

A. Hasan et al.

undergone  interactions  with  atmospheric  constituents  like  particles.
These  interactions  cause  the  radiation  to  be  scattered  in  various  di-
rections, ultimately reaching the Earth’s surface with a less defined path.
The literature offers more refined exergy-to-energy conversion fac-
tors that consider the disparity between the exergy content of direct and
diffuse  solar  radiation  [193–196].  For  instance,  Press  [193]  reported
that  the  exergy  content  of  diffuse  radiation  is  roughly  25  %  lower
compared to direct radiation. Similar findings were reported by Lands-
berg and Tonge [196]. This discrepancy can be attributed to the loss of
directivity  associated  with  diffuse  radiation,  which  inherently  repre-
sents an irreversible process.

In essence, the  Petela-Landsberg-Press factor provides a simplified
approach  for  unconcentrated  solar  radiation,  and  for  more  accurate
assessments,  factors accounting  for  the  difference  between  direct and
diffuse radiation are recommended.

2.4. Critical assessment of current theoretical DASC investigations

DASC systems have undergone analyses through experimental, nu-
merical, and analytical investigations in existing literature. A dedicated
chapter  in  this  research  is  allocated  to  exploring  the  experimental
approach. The current section is specifically designed to meticulously
evaluate the existing theoretical studies, encompassing both numerical
and  analytical  approaches,  comparing  them,  and  exploring  their  po-
tential for evolution and enhancement.

2.4.1. Numerical studies

Numerical attempts to report the thermal and radiative behavior of
nanofluid-based DASCs are built based on introducing numerical solu-
tions to the RTE and energy equation. Tyagi et al. [57] employed the
FDM  to  present  a  2D  numerical  solution  to  this  system  of  governing
equations and simulate the DASC. This solution was verified by a study
introduced  by  Otanicar  et  al.  [34]  in  which  several  nanofluids  were
numerically investigated and the results were experimentally validated
by  an  experimental  work  included  in  their  study.  After  these  two
groundworks  had  been  introduced,  the  pieces  of  research  began  to
emerge  for  DASCs’  numerical analyses  utilizing numerical  techniques
such as the FDM, FEM, and FVM. Each one of these methods has its own
advantages.  The  FDM,  for  instance,  is  characterized  by  the  ease  of
implementation and building numerical codes to solve the discretized
governing  equations  of  simple-geometry  DASCs,  such  as  the  planar
collector,  and  different  geometries.  Although  this  method  is  rarely
employed for commercial CFD software packages [197], it is frequently
used  to analyze nanofluid-based  solar  thermal systems  [59,198–203].
The FVM is employed in commercial CFD packages such as ANSYS that
is frequently used in the literature [63,126–128] for simple and regular
geometries [197]. The computational domain is discretized into finite
control  volumes  (cells),  then,  the  system  of  equations  is  solved  to
compute the properties  at the center of each cell. Finally, the FEM is
more stable than both the FDM and FVM as it discretizes the computa-
tional domain into finite elements and solves the system of governing
equations  to  predict  the  flow  properties  at  each  node  [130,204,205].
Since this technique is stable and efficient to resolve the flow in different
geometry  types  and  conditions,  it  is  employed  in  several  commercial
numerical software packages [197].

A  new  leading  open-source  computational  mechanics  toolbox
employing  the  FVM  called  OpenFOAM  software  was  utilized  by  Won
and Lee [129] to build a 2D model to simulate a DASC with a plasmonic
nanofluid and numerically investigate its thermal and optical behavior
revealing  the  effect  of  scattering  on  the  DASC  performance.  The
Monte-Carlo  method  was  used  to  numerically  solve  the  RTE  for  the
volumetric heat generation through the nanofluid to be obtained and
implemented in the model. A plasmonic nanofluid was selected for the
study  since  its  optical  characteristics  can  be  tuned  by  selecting  the
appropriate  shapes  and  sizes  of  metal  nanoparticles  employed,  also
because of the inherent LSPR effect that offers high thermal gain and

s  increase causes the back scat-

photothermal conversion potentials compared to other types of nano-
fluids [206]. Authors assumed that the flow field is parabolic along the
entire channel (fully developed Poiseuille flow) [146], and nanofluid’s
thermophysical  characteristics  are  same  as  those  of  pure  water  as
frequently  stated  in  the  literature  for  fV < 0.01%  [146,207].  Results
illustrated that the mean radiative path depth of light photons’  pene-
tration through the collector channel increases with radiation scattering
by nanoparticles and thus the solar-weighted absorption coefficient (Am)
is enhanced. On the other hand, the Knf
tering to increase as well, and thus, an optimum value for Knf
s , at which
light absorption by the nanofluid and collector photothermal conversion
efficiency are maxima, exists. Authors found that OpenFOAM software is
characterized by the ease of customization, capability of capturing fine
differences in the flow’s thermal and optical behavior, and that it pro-
vides several solvers and applications such as the solar collector [197].
Modeling of nanofluid flows in DASCs is often conducted based on
the fully-continuous single-phase Eulerian approach benefiting from the
homogeneous-nanoparticle-distribution  assumption  [208].  The  short-
comings of this approach were detailed in the previous subsection. Das
et al. [209] conducted a computational study to assess the performance
of a DASC system. Nanofluids containing TiO2 nanoparticles (95 nm in
diameter) dispersed in water at varying concentrations (0.24, 0.4, 0.6,
1.18, and 2.0 %) have been selected for the study. The DASC system is
characterized  by  a  constant  heat  flux  applied  to  the  top  wall,  a  plug
profile specified at the inlet, and a pressure boundary condition imposed
at the outlet. Both single-phase and mixture-phase models were solved
using  the  ANSYS  FLUENT  13.0  solver.  It  was  assumed  that  all  the
thermophysical properties of the nanofluids are dependent on temper-
ature. The findings manifested that the utilization of a multiphase model
yielded more accurate results compared to a single-phase model when
comparing  with  experimental  results.  Also,  shortcomings  of  the
single-phase approach drove Sharaf et al. [85] to analyze the DASC from
the perspective of the Eulerian-Lagrangian approach to reveal the effect
of  the  discrete  nature of  nanoparticles  on  the  thermal  features of  the
system.  They  concluded  that  there  is  a  threshold  beyond  which  the
single-phase Eulerian approach becomes invalid (i.e., Re ≈ 1). As long as
Re ≤ 1, the assumption of a homogeneous single-phase fully-continuous
flow  is  valid  and  thus  the  single-phase  approach  can  be  used,  and
consequently, thermal equilibrium and no-slip assumptions between the
nanoparticles  and  base  fluid  can  be  stated.  Beyond  that  value,  the
spatially non-uniform light extinction due to the uneven nanoparticle
spatial distribution within the nanofluid and thus spatial variations in
the  nanofluid  optical  characteristics  yields  inaccurate  performance
predictions. Temperature profiles generated based on the single-phase
and  Eulerian-Lagrangian  approaches  start  showing  considerable  de-
viations  when  Re  exceeds  unity,  as  the  single-phase  approach  over-
estimates the temperature profile with increasing Re. The single-phase
approach’s inaccuracy is attributed to the overestimation of solar radi-
ation  extinction  within  the  vicinity  of  the  collector’s  upper  surface,
particularly when Re ≥ 1. The lack of light extinction in the vicinity of
the upper wall is due to particle migration from high shear regions at
high speeds (see section 6.3).

Also, the plug flow assumption (i.e. flow in which all particles in a
given cross-section have the same velocity’s magnitude and direction)
was  frequently  used  in  the  founding  literature  [34,57,131,136].  This
assumption limits the model ability to capture the actual flow and heat
transfer  features  in  DASCs  since  the  plug  flow  is  valid  for  creeping
(Re≪1) or inviscid flows, which are not the real case in DASCs wherein
Re is between 10 and 1000 [57,131]. Lee and Jang [210] found that the
plug flow assumption in DASC modeling results in overestimations of
ηPC, particularly when the heat loss coefficient (hL) and Re are high. The
fully-developed  flow  assumption  is  more  realistic  in  DASC  modeling
[146,210] although it neglects the entrance region impacts on the col-
lector performance.

Furthermore,  several  studies  [44,59,136]  have  overlooked  the

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience103(2024)10116024

A. Hasan et al.

impact  of  atmospheric  attenuation  on  the  extraterrestrial  solar  spec-
trum. They assumed a blackbody profile for incident radiation heat flux,
leading  to  inaccurate  performance  descriptions.  This  is  because  the
out-scattering and absorption efficiencies of nanofluids are dependent
on radiation wavelength, as argued in Refs. [100,137].

The effects of the base fluid’s absorption, emission, and scattering are
often neglected in the literature due to the difficulty of solving the RTE
in the medium. To show the importance of considering such effects in
the thermal conversion process in DASCs, Zhu et al. [211] developed a
comprehensive radiation model for a DASC accounting for these effects,
and provided a reliable method to evaluate the heat loss in the system.
The  model  improved  the  estimation  of  heat  loss  and  examined  how
different fluids affect the heat loss. Moreover, the model used RSM to fit
the heat loss and effective emissivity with a maximum error of 5.6 %.
The  model  is  robust  even  when  2  %  measurement  errors  were  intro-
duced, and the results are still within the acceptable accuracy range.

The reports on DASC systems with turbulent flow are very limited in
the literature although such a flow regime is possible in such industrial
applications  [197].  Furthermore,  optimization  studies  dedicated  to
DASC systems are also limited although some pieces of research have
been recently presented to the literature. Baro et al. [212] performed a
numerical  multi-objective  optimization  study  on  an  inclined  planar
DASC  (0.5 ≤ L ≤ 2 m,  0.5 ≤ W ≤ 1 m,  5 ≤ H ≤ 50 mm)  with  water/-
Al2O3 nanofluid of fV  ranged from 0 to 0.006. Results demonstrated that
ηPC,max  of  98.4  %  with  temperature  gain  of  7.81
C  were  obtained  at
optimum values (L = 0.584 m, W = 0.566 m, H = 0.05 m,   ̇m = 0.01 kg/s,
Tin, = 300.26 K, and fV  = 0.0016). Also, the maximum temperature gain
◦
C with ηPC,max  of 59.9 % was obtained at optimum values (L =
of 71.93
0.5 m, W = 1 m, H = 0.01 m,   ̇m = 0.001 kg/s, Tin  = 300.19 K, and fV  =
0.0016). Also, Hazra and Nandi [213] investigated a DASC’s parametric
behavior using a transient FDM accounting for top surface radiation and
convection heat losses, as well as bottom surface mirror reflection. Au-
thors  formulated  transient  energy  equations  for  individual  nodes,
incorporating  the  mean  Knf
simulations, they pinpointed optimal mean Knf
e  values associated with
maximum  energy  storage  efficiency  under  one  sun  (≡1000  W/m2)
incident  radiation.  Authors  established  correlations  describing  the
optimal  mean  Knf
e  as  functions  of  fluid  height  and  radiation  time  via
regression  analyses based  on  peak points.  Moreover,  for  optimization
purposes,  Hachicha  and  said  [214]  utilized  the  Response  Surface
Methodology (RSM) (i.e., a statistical approach that optimizes processes
by analyzing how various factors impact one or more response variables
using  math  and  stats  to  model  these  relationships)  to  identify  the
optimal  fV  for  maximizing  the  DASC’s  ηPC  while  minimizing  hybrid
nanofluid costs. Employing ANSYS 2021 R1 for Design of Experiment
(DOE) and optimization module, they executed a three-step optimiza-
tion process. Initially, DOE generated sampling points within input data
ranges, utilizing the central composite method (CCD) to acquire three
values for each input, resulting in nine design points. Subsequently, the
RSM established relationships between response and independent input
variables. Finally, authors employed the Multi-Objective Genetic Algo-
rithm  (MOGA),  a  variation  of  Non-dominated  Sorted  Genetic
Algorithm-II  (NSGA-II),  to  determine  optimal  solutions  based  on
objective  functions  and  constraints,  yielding  a  Pareto  frontier  or
sequence  of  optimal  solutions  for  maximizing  DASC’s  ηPC  and  mini-
mizing nanofluid costs.

2.4.2. Analytical studies

One of the earliest analytical efforts that introduced a comprehensive
analysis  of  a  volumetric  absorption  receiver  is  an  analytical  attempt
presented  by  Veeraragavan  et  al.  [136].  Authors  derived  a  reduced
model using the eigenfunction expansion technique, excluding the light
scattering impacts through nanoparticles and assuming a non-absorbing
host  medium  and  fixed  nanoparticle  radiative  characteristics.  The
non-absorbing host medium assumption is not reasonable since the host

fluid  accounts  for  the entire  collector medium and  its  optical  charac-
teristics can significantly influence the  system performance [44].  The
model accounts for both the radiative and convective losses combined
together by a single heat loss coefficient to model the surface heat losses
when  solving  the  energy  equation.  Authors  aimed  to  study  several
operating parameters, such as the particle loading (fV), channel height
(H), and concentration of sunlight, and to optimize the thermal perfor-
mance of the system. The approximation of the combined heat loss co-
efficient (hE) introduced by authors is valid for temperatures less than
750 K. Most solar thermal systems fall under this temperature limit due
to limitations caused by material degradation. Severe radiative losses,
that can no longer be neglected, occur beyond such an elevated tem-
perature. Solar radiation absorption by seeded nanoparticles and volu-
metric heat release within a flowing nanofluid was the base on which the
analytical  model  was  formulated.  The  analytical  solution  offered  a
prediction  tool  to  reveal  how  the  operating  variables  affect  the  tem-
perature  distribution and ηPC  of  the solar  system. The operating  vari-
ables are given in the study in terms of dimensionless numbers, such as
the  Peclet  number  (Pe = Pr Re = ρUcpH/kc),  Nusselt  number  (NuE =
hEH/kc),  dimensionless  irradiance  (G = CGsH/kcTin),  dimensionless
temperature  difference  (θ = kc(T (cid:0) Tin)/CGsH),  dimensionless  heat

(  ̇qʹʹʹ(y) =  ̇qʹʹʹ(y)H/CGs),  and  dimensionless

release
coordinates
(x = x/Pe H  and  y = y/H).  C,  Gs,  and  Tin  are  the  solar  concentration
factor,  irradiance,  and  inlet  temperature,  respectively.  The  flow  was
assumed  to  be  a  plug  flow,  and  since  the  nanofluid  concentrations
considered in the study were very low (fV < 0.006), their thermophys-
ical properties such as ρ, cp, and kc  were assumed to be the same as the
base  fluid’s.  The  dimensionless  parameters  were  used
to
non-dimensionlize the energy equation (Eqn 32) paving the way to solve
it  analytically.  The  dimensionless  form  of  the  energy  equation  was
presented as:

Since  Tin  was  considered  as  the  ambient  temperature  (Tamb),  the
dimensionless temperature at the inlet (θ|
x=0) is zero. Authors calculated
the optimum collector length at which the maximum photothermal ef-
ficiency (ηPC,max), which is limited by the nanofluid allowable tempera-
ture, can be achieved. Authors used the proposed analytical model to
determine the optimum efficiency and corresponding length of DASCs of
different  geometrical  configurations,  nanofluid  combinations,  Nusselt
numbers, and dimensionless volumetric heat generation values, which
helps  select  convenient  designs  of  efficient  DASCs.  The  parameters  G
and NuE were introduced to control the optimum efficiency of the system
where  their values  account for multi design configurations and many
operating  parameter  combinations,  such  as  the  collector  height  and
length, flow velocity, solar concentration, etc. Finally, authors applied
the model to a collector of 1 cm height utilizing a graphite-therminol
VP1  nanofluid  and  found  that  its  predicted  optimum  efficiency  was
0.35 and the corresponding dimensionless length was 0.86. The math-
ematical  formulation  and  solution  steps  can  be  found  in  their  work
appendices [136].

Despite  the  authors  introduced  a  ground-work  for  the  analytical
investigation of DASC systems, their model suffers, mainly, from some
limitations.  First,  the  plug  flow  assumption  limits  the  ability  of  the
model to capture the actual performance of the system, as detailed in the

obtain the Knf

a fixed single wavelength (500 nm). Third, the crucial key parameters
that have significant and direct effects on the DASC’s ηPC  were not all
revealed.

A more realistic analytical attempt was presented by Lee and Jang
[210] to determine ηPC  and the temperature profile of a DASC. Authors
assumed a fully-developed flow between the DASC plates and consid-
ered  experimentally-measured Knf
e  of  the  DI-water/MWCNT nanofluid
within a wavelength ranged from 200 nm to 2000 nm. The analytical
solution  revealed  the  key  parameters  that  affect  the  thermal  perfor-
mance of the DASC such as fV, Pe, Nu, and aspect ratio (AR = L/ H). The
fully developed velocity field of the nanofluid flow was resolved to be as

achieve a 10 % higher ηPC than the conventional SASC, which is the same

wavelength-dependent scattering and absorption were considered in the
model. The study presented a solution to the system of radiative trans-
port and energy equations stating some of the assumptions used in the
study  of  Veeraragavan  et  al.  [136]  such  as  neglecting  the  nanofluid
radiative emission for temperatures less than 750 K. However, authors
[137]  determined  the  heat  source  term  in  the  energy  equation  by
numerically computing the spectral radiative heat flux integral and then
it was approximated as a power-law function. After the approximation
was  used  in  the  energy  equation,  the  analytical  solution  became
possible. Also, they considered wavelength-dependent nanofluid radia-
tive characteristics in the model making an advance progress in DASC
analytical  modeling,  where  a  wavelength-independent  radiative  char-
acteristics assumption was stated in past studies, or numerical methods
were  followed  to  compute  their  wavelength-dependent  values.  The
system  of  equations  was  non-dimensionalized  using  five  governing
non-dimensional  groups:  two  identifying  the  heat  source,  two  identi-
fying the thermal losses to surroundings, and one identifying the relative
contribution  of  advection  and  conduction.  Results  showed  that  the
DASC’s ηPC  depends mainly on fV  despite there is a threshold beyond
which there is no point to increase fV. Furthermore, the DASC perfor-
mance is enhanced with the collector depth, but does not experience a
remarkable  change  with  the  nanoparticle  size  or  collector  inclination
angle.

3. Experimental approach for DASC investigations

This  section  dives  into  the  experimental  approaches  researchers
follow  to  study  DASC  systems. By  examining these  methods  found  in
literature,  their  strengths  and  weaknesses  can  be  considered,  particu-
larly  when  using  experimental  results  to  validate  theoretical  models.
The section is divided into two parts. The first explores how researchers
use material characterization techniques to experimentally measure the
optical properties and extinction coefficients of nanofluids. The second
part delves into methods of DASC efficiency calculation, which typically
involve using thermocouples to measure temperatures at various points
within the collector.

3.1. Optical characterization of nanofluids/spectrophotometric
characterization

The  nanofluid  optical  characteristics  are  a  function  of  the  nano-
particle shape, size, and loading in addition to the optical characteristics
of the host fluid and suspended nanoparticles. The refractive index (n) of
most  fluids  is  known  and  tabulated  for  a  wide  range  of  wavelength
including most of the solar spectrum. On the other hand, the absorptive
(also called extinction) index (κ) is not known for various fluids [216].
Since the complex refractive index (n + κi) cannot be directly measured,

the transmittance, reflectance or angles of refraction may be needed to
be measured first and then the experimental evaluation of such optical
constants  becomes possible [73,216]. Certain equipment is  needed to
conduct such measurements.

-  Spectrophotometric characterization

Literature  survey  indicated  that  most  experimental  attempts  to
optically characterize nanofluids in DASC studies were carried out based
on the  nanofluid spectral transmittance via a  spectrophotometer. The
spectrophotometer is an instrument that indicates the amount of radi-
ation absorbed within a substance by bombarding a sample by a beam of
light  and  measuring  the  intensity  of  the  transmitted  beam.  Its  basic
structure is illustrated in Fig. 17a. Modern spectrophotometers cover a
wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum (200 < λ < 2500 nm) [61,
217], and some types cover even wider ranges [216]. Spectrophotom-
eters  can  be  classified  into  two  categories:  the  single-beam  spectro-
photometer that determines a relative value of the light beam intensity
before  and  after  passing  through  the  sample,  and  the  double-beam
spectrophotometer that emits two light beams, one to the test sample
and the other to a reference sample and compare between them.

Provided that particles seeded in a solar nanofluid are much smaller
than  the  wavelength  of  the  incident  light,  and  the  independent  scat-
tering approximation is possible (α≪1), Knf
the Beer-Lambert law [73]:

e  can be calculated based on

where  Tλ,  Isample,  Iref ,  κλ,  and  l  are  spectral  transmittance,  transmitted
light beam intensity through the sample nanofluid, light beam intensity
through the reference, spectral extinction index, and path length of light
passage, respectively.

Fluidic samples are placed in glass or fused quartz cuvettes. Typi-

cally,  Knf
a  can  be  easily  calculated  when  using  a  cuvette  of  10  mm
pathlength  [69].  Since  out-scattering  and  absorption  simultaneously
occur in heterogeneous systems, the Knf
e  can be determined via a con-
ventional spectrophotometer. For very fine (nano-sized) distant disper-
sions of high absorptivity such as graphite and metallic nanoparticles,
Knf
e  can be identified with neglecting the scattering contribution since its
effect is very low [218]. Consequently, the Knf
a  with very low concen-
tration  and  without  aggregation  can  account  for  the  extinction  (i.e.,
Knf
e ≈ Knf
a ). But, if agglomeration occurs, large-size conglomerations of
nanoparticles causes the scattering phenomenon to become too strong to
be ignored any longer, and the scattering coefficient to grow with multi
orders of magnitude [69]. An integrating sphere is attached, whereupon,
between the sample cuvette and the detector, as shown in Fig. 17b, for
the spectrophotometer to be capable of out-scattering effects detection.
However,  since  the  light  beam  experiences  multiple  reflection  at  in-
terfaces between each consecutive elements of the air-window-sample
sequence,  Knf
e  determination  requires  additional  calculations  by
considering the filled cuvette as the three-slab system shown in Fig. 17c.
Methods investigating the radiative transport in such a layered system
with  the  formulation  to  obtain  the  optical  constants  can  be  found  in
detail in the literature [68,87].

After the Knf

e  is identified, the nanofluid’s solar extinction and ab-
sorption ability can be determined by finding the fraction of solar energy
stored in the nanofluid (F(y)) after a y pathlength through the nanofluid.
F(y) is given as [216,218]:

where I(λ) is the solar radiation intensity within the wavelength range

(λmin, λmax),  which  is  often  considered  at  1.5  air  mass,  and  y  is  the
nanofluid film thickness.

One of the earliest studies dedicated to optical properties measure-
ments is the experiment conducted by Otanicar et al. [216] to determine
the  extinction  indices  of  four  fluids  frequently  used  in  solar  systems
(therminol  VP-1,  propylene  glycol,  EG,  and  water).  Experiments  pre-
sented  accurate  results  in  the  most  spectral  range  and  revealed  that
water is the strongest absorber among fluids studied although it is still a
weak  absorber (water  absorbed  only  13  % of  the  incident  radiation).
Authors  conducted  measurements  utilizing  a  Shimadzu  UV-3600
UV–Vis  spectrophotometer  of  a  working  range  from  170  to  3300  nm
involving 98 % of the solar irradiation at air mass 1.5. The fluids were
placed in Spectrosil®(synthetic fused silica) cuvettes, i.e., straight sided
optically  transparent  containers  for  holding  liquid  samples  in  a  spec-
trophotometer or similar equipment, with pathlengths of 0.1, 2 and 10
mm.  Authors  decided  to  limit  the  studied  wavelength  range  to
200–1500 nm because the infrared absorption bands in propylene gly-
col, EG, and water are very strong. Energy in this spectral range accounts
for  around  85  %  of  the  total  solar  energy  [219].  The  transmittance
values,  generated  by  the  spectrophotometer  for  a  certain  path  length
cell, are a function of wavelength. An iterative technique to determine
the  optical  constants  of  some  organic  fuels  using  Fourier  Transfer
Infrared  Spectroscopy  (FTIR)  was  followed.  A  cell  of  a  nearly-unity
refractive index was used for authors to handle the cell as a single slab
eliminating any radiation absorbed or reflected from air to the window.
On the other hand, neglecting the multiple reflections at interfaces of the
air-window-sample sequence used in Otanicar et al. [216] work is not
possible since they used quartz cuvettes whose real refractive index is
around 1.5 for most spectral range. Authors used a 3-slab system, as that
shown  in  7c,  deepening  the  investigation  by  including  multiple  re-
flections, as discussed above.

Using  a  double-beam  spectrophotometer  (Perken  Elmer  Lambda
1050) for the entire wavelength range including solar radiation, Karami
et al. [220] measured the transmittance and other optical characteristics
of a nanofluid containing CuO nanoparticles suspended in a (70:30 vol
%) water-EG mixture. Also, Lee and Jang [105] experimentally studied
the Knf
e  of a water/MWCNT nanofluid in a DASC. Initial measurements
were  conducted  using  Lambert–Beer  law  at  a  fixed  wavelength
(632.8 nm). Three main parts were included in the measurement system;
a He–Ne laser with wavelength and power of 632.8 nm and 200 mW,
respectively; a sample fluid; and detecting units such as the photodiode
and powermeter. For the sample fluid Knf
e  measurement, the first step
was  to  calculate  the  extinction  index  in  the  three-slab  system  as  dis-
cussed by Large et al. [221] that split the system into a set of discrete
elements  and  computed  the  optical  characteristics  consecutively.  A
detailed formulation can be found in the literature [73,105,221].

Authors showed that incident radiation can be totally absorbed in 10

cm penetration depth using fV  as low as 0.0005 vol% and that the Knf
e  of
water/MWCNT  nanofluid  grows  linearly  with  fV  in  the  range  from
0.0005 to 0.005 vol%. Comparing the experimental results with theo-
retical models (Maxwell-Garnett for cylinder and the Rayleigh scattering
approximation) showed that the conventional Maxwell-Garnett model
that considers the shape effect is inaccurate for Knf
e  predictions. On the
other hand, the Rayleigh scattering approximation that takes size impact
into consideration can qualitatively anticipate the Knf
e  of water/MWCNT
nanofluids.  Furthermore,  Lee  and  Jang  [210]  analytically  studied the
performance  of  a  DASC  utilizing  DI-water/MWCNT  nanofluid  with
concentration  ranged  from  0.0005  to  0.005  %  taking  into  account
experimentally-measured  Knf
e  by  the  UV/Vis/NIR  spectrophotometer
(Cary 5000, Varian, Inc.) according to 200–2000 nm wavelength range.
The dual beam measurement technique, as detailed in the study [218],
was followed and then the Knf
e  was obtained using the Beer-Lambert law
where air was used as a reference [210]. Based on Eq. (101), the spectral
Knf
e  was plotted, as shown in Fig. 18a, demonstrating that nanofluids can

absorb the incident radiation in the relatively short wavelength range
(visible and infrared), but pure DI-water cannot. However, in the region
where the wavelength is greater than 1400 nm, the nanofluids and pure
DI-water extinction coefficients are nearly congruent, which means that
nanofluids absorbed the radiation in the wavelength ranged from 200 to
1400 nm. Similar results were reported in Refs. [87,111,117,218].

insignificant, as stated earlier. To assess that, the albedo, which is the
fraction of light a surface reflects (the ratio of scattering to extinction)
should be obtained [117]. Despite Lee and Jang [210] found that the
albedo was of a relatively great value (~20 %) only in the short wave-
length  range  (200–300  nm),  the  incident  radiation  intensity  in  that
range was weak as well (see Fig. 18b). Also, they observed that the al-
bedo significantly decreases with the wavelength, which points out that

measure the Knf

with  a surfactant. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scan-
ning  electron  microscopy  (SEM)  were  used  to  characterize  nano-
particles.  The  Knf

Also, experimental research is useful to validate theoretical optical
models and assess their assertions. Gorji and Ranjbar [63] presented an
experimental part in their research work to measure the optical prop-
erties  of  three  nanofluids  composed  of  distilled  water  and  graphite,
magnetite (Fe3O4), and silver nanoparticles working in a planar DASC.
Experiments were conducted to validate presented model predictions.

Experimental  Knf
e  values  were  obtained  based  on  the  Beer-Lambert
principle,  and  theoretical  ones  were  obtained  based  on  the  Rayleigh
scattering model. Discrepancies between experimental and simulation
results were observed in their work (see Fig. 19). For a silver nanofluid,
the model overestimates the Knf
e  before 500 nm and underestimates after
500  nm.  This  observation  supports  Taylor  et  al.  [87]  assertions,  dis-
cussed earlier, about the Rayleigh theory. Metallic nanoparticle surface
oxidation  can  explain  that  metal  nanoparticles  have  different  optical
characteristics than their bulk material. Also, nanoparticle agglomera-
tion deforms their spherical shape and enlarges their size over the initial
(rated) one used in calculations, which leads to inconsistencies between
the experimental results and Rayleigh approximation predictions. Such
experimental uncertainties should be considered in model validations.

3.2. Thermal performance of DASCs

This subsection discusses the experimental attempts that investigate
the  thermal  performance  of  DASC  systems.  These  studies  often  use
thermocouples to measure the nanofluid temperatures at different po-
sitions  on  the  DASC.  Such  experiments  are  primarily  conducted  to
validate  theoretical  models  developed  to  investigate  DASCs.  Otanicar
et al. [34] examined the impacts of three nanoparticle material types

performance of a micro-DASC. Results were used to validate a mathe-
matical  model  similar  to  that  of  Tyagi  et  al.  [57].  Experimental  data
were obtained using three T-type thermocouples mounted on the DASC
to measure the temperatures at three different positions (inlet, midpoint
of bottom wall, and outlet). Data from both experimental and numerical
parts  showed  good  agreement  and  similar  behavior  where  both
demonstrated  that  as  fV  increases,  ηPC  of  the  DASC  rapidly  climbs
initially and then it levels off after fV  reaches  0.5 %, as illustrated in
Fig. 20.

Also, Lenert and Wang [28] obtained temperature profiles of ther-
minol VP-1 based carbon-coated cobalt nanofluid of 28 nm nanoparticle
size  and  different  coating  thicknesses  to  measure  the  optimum  one.
Experimental and numerical results showed an agreement with a per-
centage  error  of  20  %.  Authors  justified  this  discrepancy  by  the
remarkable temperature difference between the bottom and top walls,
which stimulates heat redistribution through conductive side walls but
cannot be captured by the numerical model. Taylor et al. [87] experi-
mentally  and  numerically  characterized  the  optical  properties  of
different nanofluids composed of water or therminol VP1 as a base fluid
and seeded by graphite, silver, copper, gold, or aluminum nanoparticles
to  examine  their  working  capabilities  in  DASCs.  They  argued  that
around  95  %  of  incident  radiation  can  be  absorbed  (in  a  nanofluid
thickness ⩾10 cm) with fV  values as small as 10 ppm, which means also
that the use of solar nanofluids with such trace particle loading has a
negligible effect on pumping power. Authors observed that experimental
and  numerical  results  showed  good  endorsement  in  revealing  optical
characteristics  of  graphite  and  aluminum  nanofluids.  However,
model-predicted  results  were  inaccurate  for  the  other  metals  investi-
gated, particularly falling short in capturing the significant anticipated
plasmon peaks (e.g., silver). The disparity between the numerical and
experimental results can primarily be ascribed to impurities in the ma-
terials; for instance, oxidation or other contaminants on the nanoparticle
surface may result in outcomes that weakly align with the theoretical
model.

To  exceed  the  laboratory  scale  experiments,  Karami  et  al.  [60]
examined CuO/water-EG (70:30 vol%), for the first time in the litera-
ture, in a full-scale DASC for domestic applications. EN12975-2 standard
procedure was followed to build the setup and investigate the thermal
performance  of  the  collector  with  respect  to  fV,   ̇m,  and  two  different
bottom walls (black and reflective). The use of the nanofluid raised the
DASC’s ηPC  by up to 17 % compared to the pure carrier fluid. Also, tests
showed that the collector with a black bottom wall was 11.4 % more
efficient than that with a reflective one. Also, experiments showed that

the ηPC  asymptotically increased with fV  and   ̇m, and that the maximum
zero-loss ηPC  occurred at fV  and   ̇m of 100 ppm and 0.025 kg/s, respec-
tively, and it was 17 % higher than that with the pure base fluid at the
same   ̇m. Based on experimental observations, authors suggested a cor-
relation for the studied system’s ηPC  function of the fV  ranged from 0 to
 ̇
100  ppm  and  volume  flow  rate  (
V)  ranged  from  54  to  90  lit/h,  in
addition  to  the  inlet  (Tin)  and  ambient  (Tamb)  temperatures  and  solar
irradiation (Gs):

The  OTPs  of  the  proposed  nanofluid  was  introduced  in  another
research  work  [220]  that  was  discussed  in  the  previous  subsection.
Delfani et al. [59] replicated the same procedure and investigations with
a  different  nanofluid.  They  experimentally  revealed  the  OTPs  of
carboxyl  functionalized  MWCNT  blended  in  a  water-EG  (70  %:30  %)
mixture working as a nanofluid in a domestic-applications DASC pro-
totype  and  examined  the  DASC  thermal  performance  based  on  EN
12975-2 standard at various   ̇V (54–90 l/h), fV  (0–100), and two different
 ̇
bottom walls (black and reflective). ηPC  increased asymptotically with
V
 ̇m  and  fV  of  0.025  kg/s  and  100  ppm,
and  fV.  Zero-loss  ηPC,max  at
respectively, was 29 % higher than that of the pure base fluid at the same
 ̇
V,  which  means  that  MWCNT-based  nanofluid  outperformed  the
CuO-based one in this regard.

In  the  previously  discussed  study, Karami  et  al.  [220]  studied  the
thermal  conductivity  and  viscosity  of  the  CuO/water-EG  nanofluid.
Based on the experimental data obtained, they presented correlations for
thermal conductivity (knf ) and viscosity (μnf ) of the nanofluid function of
the  operating  temperature  (T)  and  fV  in  the  same  study  ranges:

This full-scale experiment was followed by Gupta et al. [223] who
experimentally tested a full-scale DASC of 1.4 m2 gross area employing
water/Al2O3  nanofluid  of  (0.001–0.05  %)  concentration  and  20  nm
nanoparticle  size.  Experiments  showed  that  collector’s  ηPC  peaked  at
some fV  values. For instance, it reached 39.6 % at fV  of 0.005 %, and then

lowered at less or greater fV  values.

Several researchers stated that experimental uncertainties might be
responsible  for  disparities  between  experimental  results  and  model
predictions in DASC studies. For example, Luo et al. [58] experimentally
verified a model predictions obtained by solving radiation, conduction
and  convection  heat  transfer  equations  to  report  on  efficiency  and
temperature  distribution  in  a  DASC.  Experimental  results  fairly
endorsed  the  model  predictions.  Authors  explained  why  predictions
were 3–9% lower than experimental values by the fact that the fluid at
the inlet was heated by radiation, but it was set 300 K in the simulation.
Moreover, since thermocouples are under solar radiation, they can be
hotter than the fluid there. Furthermore, Struchalin et al. [224] exper-
imentally  and  numerically  examined  the  performance  of  a  tubular
DASC.  Comparisons  between  the  CFD  model  predictions  and  experi-
mental results showed discrepancies of up to 22 % in some cases as the
model underpredicts the collector performance. Authors attributed the
discrepancies to the asymmetric distribution of radiation from the solar
simulator  that  was  not  represented  by  the  model,  and  to  the  mutual
radiation reflection from the tubes.

3.3. Limitations of the presently employed experimental methods

The surface oxidation of nanoparticles leads to disparities between
the OTPs of nanoparticles and those of their bulk counterparts. Addi-
tionally,  nanoparticle  agglomeration  can  distort  their  spherical  shape
and  increase  their  size  beyond  the  initially  rated  dimensions  used  in
theoretical  calculations,  resulting  in  inconsistencies  between  experi-
mental observations and theoretical predictions. The discrepancy arises
from the agglomeration of nanoparticles within the nanofluid, leading to
an  actual  size  different  from  the  manufacturer-provided  rated  size.
Direct detection methods, such as DLS, SEM and TEM, or similar tech-
niques, directly determine the evolution of particle size distribution over
time to assess nanoparticle agglomeration. However, the direct detec-
tion  approach  has  operational  challenges.  It  requires  a  significant
quantity of samples, with some DLS instruments demanding large vol-
umes,  making  it  challenging  for  nanofluids  prepared  using  one-step
methods with limited samples. Moreover, in cases of concentrated sus-
pensions, the rapid aggregation process may outpace the measurement
time,  making  it  difficult  for  direct  detection  methods  to  capture  this
dynamic evolution [86].

Additionally, the exposure of thermocouples, used for temperature
measurements at different positions of the DASC system, to sunlight may
lead  to  artificially  higher  temperature  readings  than  the  actual  tem-
peratures of the nanofluid flow. Such experimental techniques’ limita-
tions and uncertainties lead to a lot of discrepancies between the model-
predicted performance of DASCs and the experimental results, including
the OTPs of nanofluids.

As concluded by Mahian et al. [163], in validation of computational
models by comparing their results with such experimental results sur-
veyed above, it is imperative to account for experimental uncertainties
arising from various factors including nanoparticle sedimentation and
aggregation phenomena, and potential uncertainties and measurement
errors. Also, there are several inconsistencies between the experimental
results  reported in  the  literature  and  the  predictions  of  mathematical
models. This indicates a dire need for more work on this area. Moreover,
a  number  of  parameters  playing  a  pivotal  role  in  the  enhancement
margin with nanofluids such as nanoparticle size, material type, volume
fraction, and pH of the nanofluid, need to be experimentally examined
and more thoroughly grasped [64].

4. Overview of nanofluid stability

Nanofluids have been employed in several engineering applications
since  they  have  extraordinary  characteristics  due  to  the  presence  of
nanoparticles. The immense specific surface area of nanoparticles [225]
renders their characteristics governed by the surface instead of the bulk

[226].  Additionally,  nanoparticles  may  even  be  engineered  and
designed to possess properties that are not available in their material
bulk counterpart [227], which can lead to propitious and desirable OTPs
for  different  engineering  systems  [40,228].  The  unique  properties  of
nanoparticles in the 1–100 nm range stem from two main factors. The
first is the high ratio of surface atoms to interior bulk atoms [77]. For
example,  a  3.5-nm  gold  nanoparticle  has  approximately  40  %  of  its
atoms located on the surface [229]. These surface atoms are less stable
compared  to  their  bulk  counterparts  due  to  fewer  bonds.  The  second
factor  influencing nanoparticle  properties  is  the  presence  of  quantum
effects in semiconductors and metals. These quantum effects can man-
ifest  as  unique  phenomena  like  the  LSPR  observed  in  metallic  nano-
particles [77]. LSPR signifies a special way in which light interacts with
these ultrafine particles.

The literature outlines two ways for nanoparticle synthesis: bottom-
up and top-down. The bottom-up way is constructive and builds nano-
materials from smaller parts of their counterparts such as molecules or
atoms [230]. The formation of the nanomaterials via this method occurs
through  a  set  of  chemical  techniques  and  reactions  between  some
reacting agents and the material precursors that lead to self-assembly of
atoms  and  molecules  creating  nanoparticles  of  regular  shape  and
well-defined size. The top-down way is destructive and yields a trans-
formation  of  the  bulk  material  into  nano-sized  particles  by  crushing
material particles to drop from a larger size (top) to smaller one (down)
via  several  methods  such  as  grinding,  cutting,  and  ball  milling.  This
method results in extremely small and irregularly-shaped nanoparticles.
The suspension of nanoparticles in a base fluid creates a nanofluid/
colloid/suspension. The selection of nanoparticles and base liquids for
nanofluid combination should take into consideration the components’
OTPs such as the thermal conductivity (kc), heat capacity (cp), viscosity
(μ),  freezing  and  boiling  temperatures,  thermal  stability,  tendency  to
agglomeration, and light extinction ability. Also, the base liquid should
be selected such that it (1) has a non-reactive and non-corrosive nature
to not cause degradation of nanoparticles, (2) has a low viscosity for low
pumping  costs,  and  (3)  does  not  boost  agglomeration  [36].  The
enhanced thermophysical characteristics of nanofluids can be attributed
to several mechanisms including the liquid layering (mainly responsible
for the nanofluid’s increased thermal conductivity), ballistic transport
(i.e., unimpeded flow of energy-carrying particles over relatively long
distances within a suspension), Brownian motion (i.e. stochastic motion
of  nanoparticles  due  to  the  random  motion  of  base  fluid  molecules),
clustering,  and  thermophoresis  (i.e.  temperature-difference-induced
motion) [231]. Such mechanisms act on the molecular level  of nano-
fluids  and  are  induced  by  interactions  between  the  gravitational  and
other forces exerting influence on nanoparticles. The Brownian motion
and thermophoresis have the main role in increasing the heat conduc-
tion within the nanofluid since such phenomena cause heat to dissipate
over  the  nanofluid  via  micro  convection  currents  [232].  Also,  heat
dissipation  impacts  are  sharply  amplified  with  the  bulk  fluid  motion
when  nanoparticles  are  there  due  to  their  increased  chaotic  motion
whereupon. Evidence on this fact can be inferred from the literature by
observing that the increment in heat transfer accompanied by increasing
Re of a flow is higher in nanofluid flows than in conventional ones [233].
Moreover, research has provided explanations for the higher values of
heat transfer coefficients enhanced by nanofluids in both free and forced
convection  regimes  compared  to  pure  base  fluids  [234].  Authors
attributed this behavior to the higher thermal conductivity due to the
presence  of  nanoparticles  which,  additionally,  cause  the  thermal
boundary layer along the channel to severely disturb [235].

Besides thermal characteristics such as the kc  and cp, the presence of
nanoparticles, even with a very tiny quantity, causes significant modi-
fications  on  the  suspension’s  transport  and,  most  crucially,  optical
characteristics,  leading  to  considerable  enhancements  in  the  perfor-
mance  of  solar  thermal  systems  employing  nanofluids  [65].  For
instance, Zhang et al. [76] achieved 20 % enhancement in the ηPC  of a
solar thermal system using 0.15 ppm of gold nanoparticles compared to

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience103(2024)10116031

A. Hasan et al.

the pure base fluid. Also, Filho et al. [236] increased the stored thermal
energy of a DASC by up to 144 % using only 6.5 ppm of silver nano-
particles.  Furthermore,  Wen  et  al.  [237]  increased  the  photothermal
conversion efficiency of a DASC by 67.1 % by less than 50 ppm of TiN
nanoparticles suspended in EG. Such enhancements are attributed to the
significant enhancements in optical characteristics of working fluids by
adding nanoparticles.

Particles suspended in a fluidic medium suffer from the gravitational
effects  that  drive  particles  to  cluster  and  settle  at  the  bottom  of  the
channel. However, when particles are nano-sized, they can stay afloat
and resistant to the possible deposition at the bottom. Still, other forces
that affect nanoparticles such as the van der Waals force, even at very
low concentrations, can put them at risk of agglomeration that conse-
quently  leads  to  sedimentation  and  deteriorates  the  nanofluid  perfor-
mance.  Some  kinds  of  suspensions  are  stable,  but  others  have
nanoparticles  with  tendency  to  agglomerate.  Such  nanofluids  can  be
treated  by  adding  surface  acting  agents,  called  surfactants  (surface-
active  agents)  or  dispersants,  to  keep  them  from  agglomeration.  The
surfactant gets attached to the nanoparticle external wall and prevents
any  potential  adhesion  to  other  surfaces.  However,  the  nanofluid’s
prolonged exposure to intense solar flux or elevated temperatures leads
to its destabilization, which weakens its ability to extinct solar radiation
and thus diminishes the ηPC  of the solar system [77]. Stability is one of
the most important features that should characterize a solar nanofluid
[66].  Studies,  therefore,  suggested  many  dispersants/surfactants  to
enhance stability and revealed their role in enhancing the absorption
capacity of the nanofluid [238].

Understanding the destabilization mechanisms and their impact on
solar nanofluids is imperative for devising resilient photothermal con-
version systems, highlighting the pivotal role of stability in sustaining
desired optical and thermal properties throughout the operational life-
span. The extremely small size of nanoparticles makes their interactions
within the liquid they are surrounded by, such as the attraction between
opposite  charges,  Brownian  motion,  and  viscous  resistance  they  face
from the liquid, highly intricate. A commonly used theory to understand
the  stability  of  these  suspensions  is  the  Deryagin-Landau-Verwey-
Overbeek  (DLVO)  theory  [239].  This  theory  is  based  on  several  as-
sumptions.  The  suspension  is  dilute,  and  the  suspended  particles  are
assumed to be influenced solely by van der Waals attraction potential
(GA) and electrostatic repulsion potential (GR). The effects of gravity and
buoyancy are not considered, and the colloidal particles are uniformly
dispersed.  Finally,  the  ion  distribution  in  the  colloidal  medium  is
determined by electrostatic interactions, Brownian motion, and disper-
sion caused by entropy. The theory proposes that two main forces con-
trol  how  nanoparticles  behave:  attraction  (van  der  Waals  forces)  and
repulsion  (electrostatic  forces).  When  nanoparticles  approach  each
other, their energy increases until it reaches a peak (several times kBT),
and if they become even closer, the energy rapidly decreases [239]. For
instance, if gold particles (of 100 nm in radius and 10 nm distanced from
each other) are suspended in water, they will exhibit a notable van der
Waals  interaction  potential  of  approximately  (cid:0) 24kBT  [240].  These
changes  in  energy  indicate  a  shift  from  repulsive  to  attractive  forces,
respectively. In a suspension, Brownian motion of particles can lead to
collisions.  These  collisions  reduce  the  distance  between  particles,
allowing the attractive van der Waals forces to take over and bind them
together. This process of clustering is termed Diffusion-Limited Cluster
Aggregation  (DLCA)  [239,241].  Another  way  nanoparticles  cluster
together  is  known  as  Reaction-Limited  Cluster  Aggregation  (RLCA)
[241].  The  main  difference  is  that  in  DLCA,  any  collision  results  in
clustering, whereas in RLCA, nanoparticles need to collide and react to
form  clusters.  In  nanofluids,  DLCA  is  generally  considered  the  more
common process.

In  dilute  suspensions  such  as  solar  nanofluids,  where  particles
behave  individually  as  independent  objects,  various  forces  influence
their  behavior.  Notably,  the  gravitational  field  of  the  Earth  exerts  a
downward force on the particles, causing them to settle when the sur-

rounding medium is less dense. The Stokes drag equation, incorporating
the gravitational force, can be employed to estimate the sedimentation
velocity (vs), as follows [239]:

vs = 2
9

Δρga2
μbf

(107)

where Δρ is the difference between particle and base fluid densities, a is
the particle radius, g is the gravitational acceleration, and μbf  is the base
fluid viscosity. It can be observed that larger particles show a greater
tendency to sedimentation. It is reported that barium sulfate micropar-
ticles (1.3 μm) settle completely within 8 min, while sub-microparticles
(420 nm) require approximately 100  min, and nanoparticles (70 nm)
take  more  than  60  h  [239].  It  is  worth  noting  that  aggregates  will
naturally settle at an even faster rate. Moreover, the settling velocity of
nanoparticles depends on their shape because shape influences the co-
efficient of drag they experience in the fluid. Rectangular nanoparticles
of high aspect ratio show higher tendency to agglomeration. Kim et al.
[242]  examined  the  stability  of  water-based  bohemite  alumina  nano-
fluids and stated that brick-shaped nanoparticles recorded high stability
compared to blade- and platelet-shaped nanoparticles.

A  description  of  the  Brownian  motion  can  be  obtained  from  the
diffusion  coefficient  of  particles  (D)  [239]  as  given  by  the
Stokes-Einstein equation:

D = kBTbf
6πμbf a

(108)

As  the  diffusion  coefficient  depends  mainly  on  the  base  fluid  vis-
cosity and particle size, motion of particles, of less than 10 nm in size, is
mainly governed by diffusion [243].

Shear forces can lead to changes in colloid properties, although these
deviations  are  often  not  directly  observable  at  the  particle  level  but
rather in the overall system’s macroscopic properties. In dilute suspen-
sions, the nanofluid’s shear viscosity is influenced by fV  given by the
Brinkman equation (Eq. 39) or by the Einstein equation as follows:

1 + 2.5fV

(109)

Another factor affecting the nanofluid stability is the zeta potential,
that signifies the magnitude of the electrokinetic potential at the slip-
ping plane within colloidal dispersions. This slipping plane represents
the  boundary  between  mobile  bulk  fluid  and  the  stagnant  fluid  layer
adhering  to  the  particle  surface.  The  charged  species  present  on  the
particle’s surface are responsible for the emergence of zeta potential. It
quantifies  the  extent  of  electrostatic  repulsion  between  similarly
charged  particles  in  close  proximity  within  the  dispersion.  Particles
possessing a high absolute zeta potential (positive or negative) experi-
ence electrical stabilization, hindering aggregation. Conversely, a low
zeta potential indicates that attractive forces can overpower repulsion,
leading to coagulation or flocculation of the colloidal dispersion. A zeta
potential  above  ±30 mV  signifies  a  stable  colloidal  suspension.
Conversely,  a  value  within  ±15 mV  indicates  instability.  Essentially,
zeta  potential  is  a  critical  indicator  of  colloidal  system  stability,
reflecting  the  balance  between  electrostatic  forces  that  keep  particles
separated and attractive forces that lead to particle aggregation. How-
ever, Chakraborti and Panigrahi et al. [244] reported that even with a
high  zeta  potential,  sedimentation  can  occur  if  the  particle  and  sur-
rounding fluid have a substantial density difference. As for the effect of
the  medium  temperature,  researchers  stated  that  zeta  potential  of
several  water-based  nanofluids  witnessed  a  dramatic  decrease  when
increasing the nanofluid temperature [245,246].

If we return to the DLVO theory, we find that the stability of colloids

relies on the total potential energy (GT), formulated as:

GT = GA + GR

(110)

The van der Waals attraction energy (GA) between two particles at a

distance  Lp(cid:0) p  from  each  other,  which  plays  an  important  role  in  the
tendency  of  nanoparticles  to  agglomeration  as  discussed  earlier,  was
given earlier in Eq. (73). For engineering-level systems with a substan-
tial number of nanoparticles, it is critical to precisely determine the van
der Waals forces and the effective Hamaker constant in nanofluids. This
requires suitable modeling and simulation methods. Given that numer-
ical methods are too time-intensive for our goals; they are not an option.
The focus should be on identifying the most appropriate approximate
analytical  formulas  to  assess  van  der  Waals  forces  and  the  effective
Hamaker  constant  for  colloidal  nanoparticles  in  solar  nanofluids.
Although there is a vast selection of formulas for these calculations be-
tween spherical particles, it is imperative to choose formulas that are
accurate for colloidal nanoparticles in nanofluids. Readers are encour-
aged to consult [77] for an overview of various methods available in the
literature for computing van der Waals interactions and the Hamaker
constant. This  work provides  a comparison  and critical assessment of
these methods as presented in the literature.

The electrostatic repulsion potential (GR) between identical spherical

particles is given as follows [244]:

GR = 2πεbf εvaς2e

(cid:0) ΚLp(cid:0) p

(111)

where  εbf ,  εv,  ς,  and  Κ  are  the  dielectric  function  of  the  base  fluid,
permittivity  of vacuum,  particle  surface  potential (electrical  potential
due  to  the  uneven  distribution  of  particles),  and  Debye  constant,
respectively. Κ(cid:0) 1  is known as the Debye length (measured in nm). For
simple GR  calculations, the surface potential is assumed to be same as
the zeta potential, which quantifies the magnitude of the electrostatic
repulsion between a particle and the surrounding liquid. This equation,
which  is  valid  when  Κa < 5  and  ς ≤ 25  mV,  is  common  for  nano-
particles. Readers are encouraged to look into different relations for GR,
for different particle shapes and configurations under different bound-
ary conditions, which are compiled and categorized in Ref. [244].

As GT  and both GA  and GR  are a function of the separation distance
between particles (Lp(cid:0) p), the colloid stability hinges on the interaction
between  them.  Brownian  motion  continuously  alters  Lp(cid:0) p,  leading  to
fluctuations in GT. Fig. 21 introduces an illustrative representation of the
potential energy of interaction versus Lp(cid:0) p with a potential barrier of two
levels: (a) low, and (b) high. By examining the figure, one can formulate
some  observations:  If  GA  dominates  over  GR  at  a  particular  distance,
particles tend to aggregate, forming large clusters and destabilizing the
suspension (Fig. 21a). This scenario can lead to faster sedimentation. In
contrast, a high total interaction potential creates a significant energy
barrier between particles (Fig. 21b). This barrier hinders agglomeration,
promoting suspension stability. However, even with this barrier, high-
energy  collisions  (e.g.,  at  elevated  temperatures)  can  overcome  it.
When the barrier is breached, attraction overpowers repulsion, pulling
particles together to form irreversible, strongly bound clusters. Low zeta

potential  (weak  repulsion)  and  high  particle  loading  can  lead  to  GA
dominance at a short Lp(cid:0) p. This can create a secondary minimum in the
potential energy profile (Fig. 21a), leading to the formation of weakly
bound  clusters.  These  clusters  can  be  frittered  by  external  forces  like
stirring  or  ultrasonication  (i.e.,  passing  ultrasonic  waves  through  a
nanofluid,  causing  vibration  in  the  agglomerated  nanoparticles  and
leading to their fragmentation), restoring suspension stability.

A  high  zeta  potential  indicates  a  sufficient  repulsive  force,  which
minimizes particle aggregation. Without this, undesirable flocculation
(clustering of nanoparticles due to their small size and surface charges)
can occur, compromising stability. Therefore, achieving and maintain-
ing a high repulsive potential is crucial for ensuring long-term stability
of  nanofluid  suspensions.  Fig.  21b  illustrates  the  positive  impact  of  a
high energy barrier on nanofluid stability.

The pH value of the suspension is closely linked to its zeta potential,
as  detailed  in  Ref.  [247].  The  pH  value  affects  the  electrical  charge
density  on  the  nanoparticle  surface,  thereby  impacting  nanofluid  sta-
bility.  Additionally,  the  pH  value  influences  the  size  and  shape  of
nanoparticles  during  their  preparation,  further  affecting  stability.  Li
et al. [248] examined how pH levels affect synthesized Ag nanoparticles’
size  and  shape,  of  which  stability  are  a  strong  function.  In  a  basic
environment  (pH  = 11),  Ag  nanoparticles  tend  to  be  spherical  with
uniform size distribution, whereas in a neutral environment, they vary
in shape from spheres to rods with less control over size distribution. As
GA, GR  and thus GT  are a function of the particle size, it is important to
highlight the influence of particle size on colloidal stability. In a study by
He et al. [249], they found that when dealing with α-Fe3O4 particles at
the  same  pH,  the  aggregation  tendency  increases  as  the  particle  size
decreases. This is attributed to the increased atom density on the surface
of  smaller  particles,  which  causes  elevated  active  site  density.  Also,
calculations offered in Ref. [244] proved that increasing the particle size
(Dp = 12, 32, and 65 nm with corresponding zeta potential of 42.6, 40.2,
and 44.1 mV, respectively) of α-Fe3O3 leads to an increase in GR  and GT
and a margin decrease in GA. Furthermore, although DLVO theory fails
to  assess  the  stability  of  non-spherical  (anisometric)  particles,  re-
searchers  state  that  the  particle  shape  has  a  significant  effect  on  the
suspension  stability.  When  Lp(cid:0) p  is  less  than  the  average  diameter  of
(non-spherical) particles, their increased surface allows for more atoms
to interact causing attractive forces to overpower repulsive forces. As a
consequence,  these  anisometric  nanoparticles  are  more  prone  to  ag-
gregation compared to their spherical counterparts [250].

One more parameter affecting the colloid stability is the dielectric
constant of the base fluid. It directly influences the repulsive potential
(GR), implying that higher dielectric constants lead to greater stability.
Water  exhibits  the  highest  dielectric  constant  over  other  base  fluids
typically  used  in  nanofluid-based  solar  thermal  systems  like  EG,  ben-
zene, ethanol, etc., indicating its strong repulsive potential. Addition-
ally, nanoparticle loading has a crucial effect on nanofluid stability as its

decreases the distance between particles (Lp(cid:0) p), which has a significant
effect on both GA  and GR, resulting in a nanofluid with poor stability
[251].

The  literature  offers  a  suitable  method,  known  as  Stability  factor
(SF), to assess the stability of a solar nanofluid based on alterations in its
optical properties. The SF reflects the change in radiation transmission
through  a  container  holding  the  nanofluid  (such  as  a  cuvette  with  a
transmissive  bottom  surface)  over  time.  SF  can  be  given  as  follows
[114]:
SF = Iinc (cid:0)
Iinc (cid:0)

Itrans(t)
Itrans(t = 0)

(112)

where Iinc and Itrans(t) are the incident and temporal transmitted spectral
radiative heat fluxes, respectively. A value of SF closer to zero indicates
the presence of colloidal or chemical instabilities, whereas a value closer
to  one  signifies  stability.  In  a  study  by  Choi  et  al.  [114],  the  SF  of
MWCNTs dispersed in water using various surfactants (Sodium dodecyl
benzene  sulfonate  (SDBS),  Sodium  dodecylsulfate  (SDS),  Cetyl-
trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), and TX-100) were evaluated. The
analysis  considers  two  scenarios:  long-term  storage  at  room  tempera-
ture, and heating to 85
C for a short duration. A slight decline in SF of
nanofluids  over  time  during  storage  was  observed  and  attributed  to
physical  instability,  such  as  sedimentation  of  particles.  Conversely,  a
sharp decrease in SF  of the nanofluid with the TX-100 surfactant was
observed  upon  heating,  and  explained  by  the  chemical  instability,
potentially due to surfactant degradation. Furthermore, the authors re-
ported the solar-weighted absorption coefficients of the nanofluid with
various  surfactants  and  stability  factors.  They  concluded  that  a  solar
nanofluid’s dispersion stability directly influences its optical properties
and ability to absorb solar radiation.

◦

Due  to  the  significant  interfacial  area  between  their  two  phases,
nanofluids often face stability issues, prompting researchers to propose
several  stabilization  strategies.  These  strategies  can  be  preventive
(protection  before  agglomeration  happens)  and  responsive  (breaking
already agglomerated particles away). Preventive techniques are foun-
ded on creating particles with strong repulsive potential that can sup-
press the van der Waals attraction and prevent particle agglomeration.
The literature presents a bundle of these preventive techniques such as
the  electrostatic  (charge-induced)  stabilization,  steric  (polymer-
induced) stabilization, and electrosteric stabilization techniques.

Electrostatic  stabilization  involves  charging  particles,  leading  to
electrostatic repulsion when their electric double layers overlap [252].
This  method  works  well  in  base  fluids  with  high dielectric  constants.
Changes in ionic species concentration in the dispersing medium affect
the degree of electrostatic repulsion, as the electric double layer either
thins or thickens. A stronger surface charge results in a higher energy
barrier, preventing particle contact and cluster formation. As for steric
stabilization, it involves using nonionic surfactants or polymers to create
a strong repulsion between particles’ cores in a dispersion [77]. When
these  surfactants  or  polymers  adsorb  onto  the  surface  of  particles  or
droplets, they form an adsorbed layer with a thickness (denoted as δ).
This layer can be well-solvated (or hydrated) by the solvent molecules
when the solvent is compatible with the surfactant or polymer layer. As
particles or droplets approach each other within a separation distance
smaller than 2δ, the adsorbed layers can overlap or compress, resulting
in two main effects: osmotic repulsion due to unfavorable mixing of the
adsorbed  layers  in  good  solvent  conditions,  and  entropic  or  elastic
repulsion  caused  by  the  reduction  of  configurational  entropy  as  the
layers overlap. The sum of these effects leads to steric repulsion, which
creates  a  barrier  preventing  particle  contact  and  cluster  formation.
Effective steric stabilization requires complete coverage of particles by
the polymer, strong anchoring of the polymer to particle surfaces, and a
sufficiently  large  thickness  to  prevent  weak  flocculation  [253].  Elec-
trostatic stabilization method shows some key benefits over steric sta-
bilization  as  the  former  offers  long-time  effectiveness,  temperature

independence, lower prices, limited impact on hydrodynamic particle
size, and simplicity and controllability. A detailed comparison between
the  steric  stabilization  and  electrostatic  stabilization  techniques  is
offered  in  literature  [77].  Finally,  electrosteric  stabilization  combines
electrostatic and steric repulsions to offset the attractive van der Waals
forces between particles. When two particles coated with charged spe-
cies of high molecular weight approach each other, the overlap of their
molecular coatings induces both steric and electrostatic repulsions. In
the former case, the polymer chains experience restricted orientational
freedom, while in the latter, similar charged species become crowded.
Electrosteric stabilization can be achieved through physical and chem-
ical adsorption of charged macromolecules (such as ionic surfactants,
polyelectrolytes,  and  polyampholytes),  non-ionic  surfactants,  or  a
combination  of  these  methods  [254].  Electrosteric  stabilization,
although effective, has drawbacks beyond those of its individual com-
ponents (electrostatic and steric). When particles have a weak surface
charge  and  the  stabilizing  molecules  (polyelectrolytes)  have  a  strong
opposite  charge,  patchy  interactions  arise.  This  is  because  the  poly-
electrolytes may not fully coat the particle surface. These patchy areas
with  the  original  particle  charge  and  the  adsorbed  polyelectrolyte
patches with opposite charge can attract each other when particles are
close to each other [255]. This attraction between oppositely charged
patches can destabilize the entire suspension and cause the particles to
aggregate.

Exposure to solar radiation presents the most critical destabilization
factor  for  solar  nanofluids,  triggering  a  multitude  of  detrimental
chemical and colloidal instabilities [256]. A key challenge in this field
lies in developing methods to shield these fluids from prolonged ultra-
violet radiation without compromising the advantageous optical prop-
erties of the nanoparticles themselves.

Responsive treatment methods treat clustered particles by applying
energy to break up these clusters using fluid agitation and high stresses
[257].  However,  the  effectiveness  depends  on  the  cluster’s  strength.
Common techniques include ultrasonication, which uses sound waves
for  fragmenting  soft  clusters.  Ball  milling  utilizes  grinding  media  for
impact-based cluster breakdown, with a variation employing surfactants
to enhance the process, but this method might affect particle size and
shape for particles below 500 nm [258]. High-pressure shear homoge-
nization  is  a  powerful  technique  that  forces  the  nanofluid  through  a
narrow gap at high pressure, effectively breaking down all cluster sizes,
minimizing  reformation,  and  producing  pure  suspensions,  but  the
equipment is expensive, heavy, and susceptible to wear [259].

Finally,  it  is  important  to  make  a  number  of  comments  on  the
nanofluid  stability  studies  as  shown  in  literature.  In  contrast  to  pre-
vailing  assumptions  within  nanofluid  stability  literature,  a  high  zeta
potential does not invariably signify exceptional colloidal stability. This
is demonstrably true for sterically stabilized dispersions, where a low
zeta  potential  may  be  observed  despite  complete  dispersion  stability
[77]. Conversely, for electrostatically stabilized dispersions, alterations
in  ionic  strength  due  to  factors  like  contamination  or  oxidation  can
induce variations in the electrical double layer thickness. Consequently,
the  zeta  potential  value  required  for  optimal  colloidal  stability  also
undergoes modification. Therefore, a more precise interpretation of zeta
potential  limits  it  to  an  indicator  of  electrostatic  repulsion  forces  be-
tween colloidal nanoparticles.

Furthermore,  the  DLVO  theory,  while  valuable,  has  limitations  in
capturing  the  complexities  of  nanofluid  behavior.  A  multi-scale
approach bridges this gap by combining the strengths of the, discussed
earlier, atomistic simulations (MD) and system-level simulations (DPD,
Eulerian-Lagrangian).  MD  simulations  provide  accurate  interparticle
force calculations at the nanoscale, crucial for understanding stability.
However, MD becomes computationally expensive for many particles.
System-level simulations handle larger numbers of particles and model
complex  interactions  like  colloidal  behavior  and  thermal  effects,  but
struggle to capture intricate details. By leveraging MD for force calcu-
lations and feeding them into system-level simulations, the multi-scale

approach creates a more comprehensive picture of nanofluid behavior,
paving the way for designing stable solar nanofluids and predicting their
performance in real-world applications.

5. Effects of the working fluid properties and geometric
parameters on DASC performance

This  section  explores  how  nanofluids  influence  the  thermal  and
radiative performance of DASC. It examines how the type of base fluid,
along with nanoparticle size, shape, material, and concentration, affect
the  DASC  performance.  Additionally,  research  has  shown  that  the
DASC’s geometric parameters play a crucial role in its thermal perfor-
mance.  Collector  geometry,  particularly  length,  height,  and  design,
significantly impacts the volumetric absorption of solar radiation. This
section delves into the effects of these parameters.

5.1. Base fluid type

The performance of a thermal system is significantly influenced by
the  thermophysical  properties  of  the  working  fluid.  In  solar  thermal
systems, commonly used liquids, such as water, kerosene, ionic liquids,
engine  oil,  paraffin  oil,  therminol  VP-1,  EG,  and  propylene  glycol,
exhibit poor optical characteristics for efficient solar radiation absorp-
tion  [216].  Consequently,  there  arises  a  critical  need  to  modify  the
properties of these thermal fluids. Engineered nanofluids have emerged
as  a  solution to address  this challenge. However,  since  the  base fluid
amount is much greater than nanoparticles, the nanofluid properties are
dominated by the base fluid’s properties, while nanoparticles just cause
alterations  [36]. The  base fluid  OTPs  have significant  impacts  on the
characteristics of the nanofluid obtained and thus on the overall system
performance [260].

Otanicar et al. [216] experimentally tested four heat transfer fluids
(water, therminol VP-1, EG, and propylene glycol) on the solar radiation
absorption  capacity  and  reported  their  extinction
indices  and
solar-weighted  absorption  coefficients  (Am)  (i.e.  the  portion  of  solar
radiation absorbed through a nanofluid layer of a certain thickness) over
the wavelength ranged from 0.17 to 3.3 μm. Results demonstrated that
water  was  the  strongest  solar  energy  absorber  among  the  four  tested
fluids with an Am  of 13.57 % against only 9.25, 9.06, and 2.098 % for
EG,  propylene  glycol, and  therminol  VP-1,  respectively. Furthermore,
Ladjevardi et al. [49] reported the intensity of light passing through pure
water working in a DASC for different depths. Authors found that light
absorption ability of water in the IR range is much greater than in other
regions. In 1 m depth, all the incident radiation of greater than 0.75 μm
wavelength is absorbed by water. However, in the visible and UV re-
gions, irradiation keeps much of its primary energy. Sani et al. [261]
confirmed  that  water  outperformed  EG  from  the  radiative  behavior
perspective as the water/single wall carbon nanohorn (SWCNH) nano-
fluid of 0.01 g/lit concentration showed a 5 % higher absorbed energy
fraction than that of EG/SWCNH nanofluid at the same concentration.
However, they concluded that EG is a more appropriate base fluid for
practical  solar  thermal  systems  than  water  as  it  has  several  more
appropriate thermophysical properties. For instance, the lower freezing
point of EG keeps the solar system from damage when operating in very
◦
cold  regions  (down  to  (cid:0) 6
C,  as  in  Struchalin  et  al.  [224]).  Also,  its
higher boiling point allows for its utilization in high-temperature ther-
mal systems or solar systems of high concentration ratios such as those
operating in desert regions. That is why in some thermal applications,
EG is mixed with water to keep thermal systems from freezing and/or to
allow for higher operating temperatures. Moreover, for nanofluid sys-
tems, the suspension of some types of nanoparticles such the SWCNH in
EG are easier than in water and with no need for surfactants. On the
other hand, thermal conductivity of EG is lower than that of water, but
the  suspension  of  carbon  nanoparticles  in  EG  enhances  its  thermal
conductivity and other heat transfer characteristics as confirmed in the
literature [261].

Investigating  the  effect  of  base  fluids  on  DASC  performance  aside
from other parameters and conditions is not possible. That is why one
can find contradictions in the literature when trying to select the most
appropriate candidate base fluid. Although Sharaf et al. [262] confirmed
the superiority of water-based nanofluids in DASCs over those employ-
ing  therminol-VP1-based  ones,  they  had  something  different  to  say
about  the  superiority  of  water  as  the  strongest  absorber  base  fluid  in
DASCs.  They  reported  the  Knf
behavior  of  both  water-  and
e
therminol-VP-1-based graphite nanofluids with fV. They found that as fV
increases, the spectral Knf
e  of therminol-based nanofluid excels that of
the  water-based  one  in  the  wavelength  region  (0.28–1.5  μm).  Conse-
quently, the temperature levels up at the collector top surface and thus
thermal
increase  when  using  a
therminol-VP-1-based nanofluid with a high fV. Such a behavior causes
DASCs  employing  therminol-VP-1-based  nanofluids  to  exhibit  poor
performance compared to those employing water-based ones at high fV
even though the former nanofluid has a stronger radiation absorption
ability  than  the  latter.  Therefore,  authors  concluded  that  the  DASC
employing a nanofluid of stronger optical characteristics and a higher
solar radiation extinction ability does not necessarily have the highest
ηPC  due to the increased thermal losses with increasing the temperature
gain. For instance, Gou et al. [263] reported that Knf
e  of Ti3C2 nanofluid,
(cid:0) 1, which is 1000 times that of pure base
at 0.02 wt%, reached 10 cm
fluid. However, ηPC of the system using this nanofluid was 2.7 times that
of pure base fluid.

losses

to

The response of DASC performance to the base fluid type changes
with  factors  such  as  the  nanofluid  concentration  and  bottom  surface
emissivity.  Thus,  one  can  conclude  that  a  base  fluid  leads  to  higher
performance  at  given  values  of  fV  and  bottom  emissivity,  however,
another  base  fluid  can  be  better  at  different  conditions.  Sharaf  et  al.
[262], again, explained such a case by comparing efficiencies of DASCs
utilizing  water-  and  therminol-VP-1-based  graphite  nanofluids  of
different  concentrations  and  using  bottom  surfaces  of  different  emis-
sivities as illustrated in Fig. 22. The figure shows the optimum nanofluid
concentrations at which DASC’s ηPC  is maximum. These results are in
agreement  with  the  literature  [34,100,130,264].  However,  results
confirm that the optimum fV  differs with the base fluid type and bottom
surface emissivity. Also, one can state that the base fluid type and fV
insignificantly affect the DASC’s ηPC when the bottom surface emissivity
is  high.  Moreover,  DASCs  employing  water-based  nanofluids  always
show superior performance when fV  is high (≥ 0.05%), no matter what
the  bottom  surface  emissivity  is,  where  the  sensitivity  of  ηPC  to  the
bottom  surface  emissivity  is  negligible  when  fV  is  high.  This  can  be
justified by the fact that at high fV, most light is absorbed at the nano-
fluid top layers. Thus, the role of the bottom wall is considered irrelevant
and the DASC behavior becomes similar to a surface absorber [34].

Understanding roles of ionic liquid base fluids in improving the ab-
sorption characteristics of nanofluids paves the way for DASC perfor-
mance enhancements. Cao et al. [265] studied the impact of ionic liquids
base  fluids,  in  which  Fe3O4  nanoparticles  are  suspended,  on  the  per-
formance  of  DASCs  and  investigated  the  effects  of  the  cation  (i.e.,
positively-charged  ions)  anion  (i.e.,  negatively-charged  ions)  radii  on
the optical behavior. Authors found that increasing the cation or anion
radius  decreases  the  ionic  nanofluid  transmittance  dramatically.
Consequently, the absorption ability of the nanofluid is enhanced.

As for the effect of the base fluid thermal properties, such as thermal
conductivity,  on  the  DASC  thermal  performance,  it  is  important  to
remember  that  the  thermal  conductivity  of  a  nanofluid  depends  on
several parameters, including the nanoparticle size, shape, loading, and
material  type,  stability,  medium  temperature,  presence  of  dispersant,
measurement technique, and mainly, base fluid’s thermal conductivity.
Sharaf  et  al.  [138]  stated  that  the  enhancement  in  the  nanofluid’s
thermal  conductivity  accompanied  by  the  addition  of  nanoparticles
causes  a  remarkable  effect  on  ηPC  of  DASC  if  the  base  fluid  is  with
inherently low thermal conductivity such as therminol VP-1 and EG. On

the other hand, if the base fluid inherently has high thermal conductivity
such  as  water,  the  DASC’s  ηPC  sensitivity to  the  alteration of  thermal
conductivity  is  barely  noticeable.  Similar  results  were  obtained  by
Hwang  et  al.  [266].  However,  Gao  et  al.  [267]  concluded  that  the
greatest thermal conductivity value of a graphene nanoplatelets nano-
fluid can be obtained by using a (1:1) EG-water mixture as a base fluid.
Menni  et  al.  [268]  conducted  a  CFD  investigation  of  three  different
nanofluids  composed  of  Al2O3  nanoparticles  and  water,  EG,  and
water-EG mixture as base fluids to compare them in terms of thermo-
physical and hydrodynamic characteristics. Authors nominated the EG
as  the  superior  base  fluid  over  the  other  two  ones  since  the  Nu  of
EG-based nanofluid flow was higher than the other two. However, the
sensitivity of the friction coefficient of the flow to the base fluid type is
negligible as all nanofluids showed nearly identical friction coefficient
values. On the other hand, Gholinia et al. [269] stated that the engine oil
excels  water  from  the  temperature  gain  and  flow  properties
perspectives.

Although water was classified as a strong light-absorber base fluid,
EG and engine oil were found to have superior thermophysical and heat
transfer  characteristics  in  comparison  with  water.  However,  blending
EG  with  water  enhances  its  thermal  characteristics  to  be,  besides  its
optical ones, more appropriate [67].

5.2. Nanoparticle materials type

The extent of properties alteration caused by dispersed phases highly
depends on the particle material type. The nanoparticle material types
employed  in  DASCs  can  be  categorized  into  three  groups:  metallic
nanoparticles such as iron (Fe), aluminum (Al), copper (Cu), silver (Ag),
gold  (Au),  etc.,  metal  oxide  nanoparticles  such  as  alumina  (Al2O3),
copper  oxide  (CuO), magnesium  oxide  (MgO), zinc  oxide (ZnO),  tita-
nium dioxide (TiO2), magnetite (Fe3O4), etc., and carbon-based nano-
particles  such  as  graphene,  graphite,  diamond,  carbon  nanohorns,
carbon nanotubes, etc.

5.2.1. Metallic nanoparticles

Several  researchers  concluded  that  the  enhanced  thermal  conduc-
tivity  of  nanofluids  is  the  cornerstone  in  improving  the  ηPC  of  solar
systems  [266].  A  look  at  the  literature  reveals  that  metallic  nano-
particles lead to higher-performance solar thermal systems than metal
oxide nanoparticles [270]. Besides the LSPR effect of interest to solar
thermal  systems,  this  is  justified  by  the  high  thermal  conductivity  of
metallic nanoparticles [271]. The comparison between metallic nano-
particles  themselves  is  also  essential  in  light  of  some  inconsistencies

offered in literature. Sinha et al. [272] observed that while Cu escalated
the thermal conductivity of the suspension by 70 %, Fe did by only 33 %
when both are dispersed in the same medium (EG) with the same fV  (1
%). As a result, Campos et al. [273] stated that Cu nanoparticles pro-
vided the highest ηPC  and temperature gain in a DASC versus Au and Ag
nanoparticles.  Conversely,  Parvin  et  al.  [130]  concluded  that  DASCs
employing  Ag  nanoparticles  outperform  those  employing  Cu  ones  in
terms of ηPC  at fV  of 3 %. It was observed that Ag and Au, even with tiny
concentrations, are excellent candidates for DASCs due to the LSPR ef-
fect. Chen et al. [199] found that Ag nanoparticles with fV  of 0.03 % in a
DASC escalates ηPC  up to 90 %. Also, Filho et al. [236] increased the
stored thermal energy of a DASC by up to 144 % using only 6.5 ppm of
Ag nanoparticles. Zhang et al. [76] achieved 20 % enhancement in the
ηPC of a DASC using 0.15 ppm of AuNPs compared to the pure base fluid.
Furthermore, Au can be used as an excellent shell for core/shell nano-
fluids  with  very  high  absorption  ability  due  to  the  LSPR  effect  [274,
275]. In terms of Au nanofluids stability, Sharaf et al. [276] showed that
polyethylene  glycol-coated  AuNPs  are  potential  materials  of  strong
stability and thermal performance features for functional deployment in
DASCs running at minimum fV  and maximum power gains. Also, Al is
offered in the literature as a strong broadband sunlight absorber to a
certain extent in DASCs [57,131,137].

5.2.2. Metal-oxide nanoparticles

On the other hand, Agarwal et al. [277] investigated the sensitivity
of thermal conductivity of water and EG base fluids to the suspension of
metal oxide-based nanomaterials such as alumina (Al2O3) nanoparticles.
Results showed that water- and EG-based nanofluids achieved 30 % and
◦
C tem-
31 % enhancements, respectively, at 2 % concentration and 70
perature. Also, Prado et al. [278] proposed MgO/n-C14 as a novel metal
oxide nanofluid with 10 % mass fraction. Authors achieved an increase
in thermal conductivity by 17 % compared to that of the carrier fluid.
Back to the effects on DASCs performance, Khatri et al. [279] achieved
13 % enhancement in a DASC’s ηPC by employing water/Al2O3 nanofluid
of 0.01 % concentration. Thakur et al. [280] conducted a comparative
analysis of alumina and silica nanoparticles in fly ash-based nanofluids
working  in  a  microchannel-based  DASC.  Alumina/fly  ash  (80:20)
nanofluid  exhibited  a  higher  ηPC  of  72.8  %,  compared  to  59.2  %  for
silica/fly ash (80:20) nanofluid. However, the pumping power require-
ment for alumina/fly ash was 3 % higher than that for silica/fly ash. The
improved ηPC is attributed to the superior thermal conductivity and heat
capacity of alumina/fly ash. Furthermore, exergy efficiency was higher
for  alumina/fly  ash  due  to  the  higher  cp  of  alumina  nanoparticles,
resulting  in  less  exergy  destruction  compared  to  silica/fly  ash-based

nanofluids.  However,  alumina  is  offered  in  the  literature  as  a  weak
broadband  sunlight  absorber  in  DASCs  [98,131,223,281].  Milanese
et  al.  [282]  conducted  transmittance  measurements  on  water-based
metal  oxide  nanofluids  including  Al2O3,  CuO,  TiO,  ZnO,  CeO2,  and
Fe2O3  at fV  values ranging from 0.05 to 1 % over a spectral range of
200–1300 nm, utilizing a 3 mm path-length quartz cuvette. Fig. 23 il-
lustrates  the  spectral  transmittance  values  of  the  water-based  metal
oxide  nanofluids  investigated  by  authors.  Within  the  UV  band,  the
transmittance values were around zero, except for Al2O3  nanofluid. In
the IR band, the opposite happened, where transmittances climbed up to
90 %. The comparison shows that CuO and Fe2O3 nanofluids are aver-
agely  more  absorbent  than  others  even  though  CeO2  was  the  best
absorbent within the IR range. Also, authors calculated the attenuation
distance for each material at various fV  values, highlighting Al2O3 as the
worst with considerably higher extinction distance than others, while
the remaining five materials displayed significantly higher attenuation
rates, with distances of less than 0.02 m observed at fV  as low as 0.05 %.
Moreover, TiO was chosen as the best nanofluid in terms of pumping and
maintenance  costs,  where  a  nanofluid  with  0.05  %  loading  of  TiO  is
sufficient to completely absorb the sunlight within 1 cm depth.

In  addition,  magnetic  nanofluids  are  good  candidates  as  they  can
yield photothermal convection in DASCs. Balakin et al. [283] examined
a magnetic Fe2O3/water nanofluid and obtained velocity and ηPC,max  of
5  mm/s  and  65  %,  respectively,  at  2  wt%  concentration  and  28  mT
magnetic field.

5.2.3. Carbon-based nanoparticles

Carbon-based  nanofluids  are  superior  and  exhibit  higher  perfor-
mance than metal- and metal oxide-based nanofluids [58,68,128,284].
The research highlighted in Refs. [63,284,285]suggests that nanofluids
should be the preferred choice for DASC applications due to their robust
thermal and optical performance, even with very low particle loading
[286]. Ladjevardi et al. [49] asserted that 50 % of the radiation incident
on a DASC can be absorbed using a water/graphite nanofluid with fV  of
0.000025 vol% with a cost increment of only $0.0045 L-1, but pure water
can absorb 27 % only. Because of the very high thermal conductivity of
graphene  nanofluids,  they  have  recently  received  greater  attention
[287].  Ibrahim  et  al.  [288]  concluded  that  54.6  %  enhancement  in
thermal conductivity of the EG  base fluid when suspending  graphene

C. Vakili et al. [289] showed that
the DASC’s ηPC  could level up to 93.2 % using a graphene-platelet/DI
water  nanofluid  at  0.005  wt%  against  69.9  %  efficiency  using  pure
DI-water under similar conditions.

Authors experimentally assessed the potentiality of the prepared nano-
fluid  for  working  in  DASCs.  Results  revealed  that  employing  such  a
nanofluid with fV  of 0.6 % resulted in strong light absorption ability and
escalated ηPC  up to 94.5 %. Furthermore, Gorji and Ranjbar [63], in the
previously discussed  work, found  that graphite is the  strongest direct
light  absorber  as  it  absorbed  100  %  of  the  incident  light  faster  than
magnetite  and  silver  nanofluids,  as  illustrated  in  Fig.  24.  As  inferred
from the survey above, carbon-based nanofluids can be utilized as pro-
spective working fluids in DASCs.

One more evidence can be found in a comparison between the three
nanoparticle types presented by Sharaf et al. [85]. Results manifested
that  the  graphite  nanofluid  is  a  much  better  absorber  than  both  the
aluminum and alumina ones. Fig. 25 shows that the entire amount of
incident radiation had been totally absorbed by the graphite nanofluid
while light barely crossed 80 % of the collector height. However, the
aluminum nanofluid showed a better performance than the alumina one.
Despite the alumina nanofluid is frequently used in thermal systems, it is
classified  as  a  weak  absorber  in  solar  systems.  An  evident  can  be
depicted  from  Fig.  25  that  illustrated  that  variations  in  the  alumina
nanoparticle  loading  had  no  impact  on  the  total  radiative  heat  flux
within the fluid, which means that irradiation was absorbed by the base
fluid rather than nanoparticles.

Furthermore,  nanoparticles  can  cause  erosion  and  corrosion.
Research  shows  that  stainless  steel  is  preferable  for  nanofluid-based
hydraulic circuits over Al or Cu due to their resistance to degradation
[291].  Carbon-based  nanofluids  exhibit  less  corrosion  compared  to
metal or metal oxide-based nanofluids, providing an additional advan-
tage [292].

5.2.4. MXene and transition metal nitride nanoparticles

MXene is a set of 2D early transition elements (metallic nitrides or
carbides) of an Mn+1XnTx composition, where M is a transition element
(Ti,  V,  Nb,  etc.),  X  is  carbon  (C)  or  nitrogen  (N),  and  T  is  a  surface
functional group (-OH, –F, -O-, etc.). MXene nanoparticles can be sus-
pended in base fluids to create nanofluids with strong optical properties
for DASCs. Guo et al. [263] found that Knf
e  of Ti3C2 nanofluid can reach
(cid:0) 1  at 0.02 wt%, which is 1000 times that of its base fluid. Also,

Wang  et  al.  [293]  compared  MXene-based  and  graphene-based nano-
fluids  working  in  a  DASC.  Results  showed  that  since  MXene  nano-
particles exhibit plasmonic behavior in the near-IR region, MXene-based
nanofluids  showed  superior  optical  behavior  over  graphene-based
nanofluids.  The  transmittance  of  Ti3C2Tx-based  nanofluid,  at  60  ppm
concentration, was 0 against more than 10 % for the graphene-based one
at the same conditions. Consequently, ηPC of a DASC, employing Ti3C2Tx,
was higher than that employing graphene. The former reached ηPC,max
(∼ 63.3%) at 20 ppm concentration, whereas the latter needed 40 ppm

increased  the  DASC  terminal  temperature  by  14.1
employing  pure  DI-water.  Authors,  thus,  proposed  the  hybrid
CuO-MWCNT/water nanofluid as a potential working fluid for DASCs.
Recently, Generous et al. [299] investigated the heat transfer capabil-
ities  of  different  kinds  of  hybrid  nanofluids  including  Al2O3–Au,
Al2O3–CuO,  Al2O3–TiO2,  CuO–Au,  CuO–TiO2,  and  TiO2–Au  nano-
particles. They found that hybrid nanofluids involving Au nanoparticles
outperformed others in terms of heat transfer performance. Also, Wang
et al. [300] employed ZnO–Au/oil composite nanofluid in a DASC and
achieved 240 % enhancement in ηPC over that of base fluid. On the other
hand, Struchalin et al. [301] revealed that employing MWCNT nanofluid
with fV  of 0.0091 % in a DASC, under given conditions, resulted in ηPC
higher  by  up  to  31.5  %  than  that  employing  Fe3O4-MWCNT  hybrid
nanofluid. Furthermore, Wen et al. [302] numerically examined the use
of a novel nanofluid composed of water-EG (40:60) mixture as a base
fluid  with  ZrC(20  nm)-TiN(50  nm)  blended  nanoparticles  in  a  planar
DASC. Authors reported that this nanofluid is highly stable and recom-
mended for DASCs as it absorbed 99 % of the incident radiation within 1
cm penetration. Also, ηPC,max of 73.7 % was achieved at optimal fv of 160
ppm.  However,  Huminic  and  Huminic  [303]  concluded  that  since
hybrid nanofluids entail a minimum of two distinct nanoparticle types,
ensuring  their  compatibility  and  stability  remains  a  crucial  factor.
Additional investigations are necessary to explore various combinations
of  hybrid  nanoparticles,  assess  suspension  stability,  investigate  ther-
mophysical properties, and analyze heat transfer and flow characteris-
tics to be reliably employed in solar energy harvesting systems.

5.2.6. Recent advances in nanoparticle materials

For  energy  storage  besides  solar-to-thermal  conversion  purposes,
researchers proposed the phase change material (PCM) technology to be
employed  in  DASCs.  PCMs  have  high  ability  to  store  thermal  energy
from a low-temperature, renewable, or waste heat source as latent heat
through  a  charging  process  and  transfer  it,  thereafter,  through  a  dis-
charging process at constant temperature. Once the solar radiation ab-
sorption starts in a PCM-based DASC, the temperature of the PCM starts
to increase up to the melting point and then energy absorption continues
nearly at a constant temperature. Low melting-point PCMs are selected
for such solar applications, which means small temperature gradients
with  surroundings,  low  losses,  and  thus  high-efficiency  systems.  The
phase change slurry (PCS), which is produced by seeding very fine PCM
particles (micro- or nano-sized) in host fluids, and the micro- or nano-
encapsulated PCM (ePCM) for solar-to-thermal conversion and storage
systems have been in the focus of researchers’ attention in the recent few
years [304–306].

As miscellaneous suggestions found in the literature, coffee colloids
were suggested as novel organic, nontoxic, inexpensive, stable, and eco-
friendly  nanofluids  for  solar  applications  with  competitive  OTPs
[307–310]. Kosinska et al. [310] found that ηPC of coffee colloids was 12
%  higher  than  that  of  water  in  DASCs  with  a  concentration  range  of
0.005–0.04  g/ml.  In  contrast,  Nguyen  et  al.  [311]  found  that  coffee
colloids, over fV  from 0.005 to 0.02 wt%, barely outperformed water.
More recently, Zhu et al. [312] proposed a novel nanofluid composed of
DI-water  and  cuttlefish

environmentally-friendly natural biomass substance, for DASCs. Their
experimental  investigations  showed  that  the  aqueous  cuttlefish  nano-

concentration to reach ηPC  which was 60.92 % less than the former one.
Finally,  optimization  results  revealed  that  whereas  the  Ti3C2Tx
nanofluid-based  DASC  needed  3  cm  fluid  layer  depth  to  reach  its
maximum performance, the graphene-based one needed 3.5 cm.

Transition metal nitride nanoparticles work efficiently in DASCs due
to their stability and superior light absorption ability. Wen et al. [237]
increased  ηPC  of  a  DASC  by  67.1  %  by  50  ppm  of  TiN  nanoparticles
suspended in EG. Also, findings of a DASC investigation by Vital et al.
[294] indicated that nanoparticles composed of transition metal nitrides
exhibited small scattering ability and wide absorption peaks, effectively
aligning with the solar radiation spectrum. Specifically, collectors uti-
lizing TiN, ZrN, and HfN nanofluids with fV  of 0.00005 demonstrated
significantly-enhanced ηPC, surpassing that achieved with Au nanofluid,
a reference plasmonic material for solar applications, by 50.4, 36.5, and
41.8 %, respectively. Similarly, Farooq et al. [295] found that Am  of Tin
nanofluid is 80 % greater than that of Au nanofluid when both work in a
DASC under the same exact conditions.

5.2.5. Hybrid nanoparticles

Hybrid nanoparticles are synthesized from a combination of at least
two distinct nanoparticles with the aim of surpassing the constraints of
single-component nanoparticles, enhancing properties, attaining novel
properties unattainable by single nanoparticles, and/or achieving mul-
tiple functionalities within a single nanoparticle [296].

Hybrid  nanofluids,  incorporating  nanomaterials  of  varied  types,
shapes  and  sizes  dispersed  in  a  fluid  [297],  offer  superior  absorption
ability  in  contrast  to  single-component  nanofluids.  Research  demon-
strates  that  such  hybrid  nanofluids  achieve  broad-spectrum  solar  ab-
sorption [298]. Two or more different kinds of nanoparticles are seeded
in the same carrier fluid to obtain stronger OTPs. Hybrid nanofluids are a
potential  replacement  of  conventional  mono  ones  due  to  their  wider
absorption range, higher thermal conductivity, and lower pressure drop,
frictional  losses,  and  thus  required  pumping  power.  Qu  et  al.  [14]
concluded that hybrid nanofluids can result in a DASC of a higher ηPC
than  that  operating  a  mono  nanofluid.  However,  the  concentration
mixing ratio (CMR) needs to be accurately tuned, that wrong CMRs or
excessive amounts of individual nanoparticles can impoverish the DASC

occurred even after prolonged sun exposure.

Overall, it can be seen from the previous survey that carbon-based
and  2D  MXene  composite  plasmonic  nanofluids  are  super  functional
for  nanofluid-enhanced  thermal  performance  of  DASCs  with  distin-
guished  optical  and  thermal  performance,  and  thus  great ηPC  even  at
very low fV  values.

5.3. Nanoparticle size

Nanoparticle  size  is  discussed  in  the  literature  as  a  very  crucial
parameter for the evaluation of the nanofluid functionality in thermal
systems [270]. Attempts to understand the effect of nanoparticle size on
the performance of DASCs are as early as the first DASC performance
assessment  studies.  Back  to  the  Rayleigh  theory  formulation,  when
substituting Eqs. (5) and (6) in Eq. (4) which, in turn, is substituted in
Eq.  (3)  to  determine  the  spectral  Knp
e  of  nanoparticles,  it  can  then  be
observed that Knp
s ) and
absorption (Knp

e  is combined from two terms, the scattering (Knp

a ) coefficients.

Formulation  shows  that  Knp

s  changes  as  the  third  power  of  the
nanoparticle diameter (D3
p ). However, as the value of Dp  taken for the
particles is very small, the Knp
s  term results in a very small value, and thus
it can be neglected. In contrast, the value of the Knp
a  term depends on a
fixed part and on another part varying as D2
p . Tyagi et al. [57] asserted
that the slight growth of the DASC’s ηPC  with the nanoparticle size, as
their results show, is attributed to the term containing D2
p . This means
that the DASC’s ηPC  will be represented by a constant flat line when it is
plotted against the particle size if D2
p  is removed from Eq. (5). Basically,
since  Dp  has  a  very  small  value,  the  fixed  expression  containing  con-
stants  in  Eq.  (5)  dominates  the  value  of  Knp
e ,  and  the  expression  con-
taining D2
p  has a very little effect demonstrated in the slight growth in the
plot. Mathematically speaking, much larger nanoparticles let the second
term  dominate  and  as  a  result  the  Knp
e  and  thus  the  DASC’s  ηPC
dramatically increase. But, as discussed earlier, the Rayleigh scattering
approach  would  not  be  valid  anymore  beyond  a  specific  value  of
nanoparticle  diameter  (i.e.,  α = πDp/λ≪1),  and  consequently,  such
equations  can  no  longer  be  used  to  evaluate  the  Knp
in  a  nanofluid.
e
Similar results and justifications were presented by Cregan and Myers
[137].

For  more  viewpoints,  several  studies  provided  more  detailed
description for the nanofluid’s optical behavior with particle size, and
stated that the nanofluid response differs with the incident light wave-
length. For instance, Said et al. [314] used the Rayleigh approximation
to evaluate Knf
e  of a TiO2-based nanofluid working in a DASC. Results
revealed that nanoparticles below 5 nm in diameter have nearly iden-
tical Knf
a  values and that increasing the nanoparticle size caused Knf
a  to
increase.  However,  for  all  investigated  sizes  (Dp ≤ 20  nm),  high  and
non-zero Knf
a  values appeared for light wavelengths below 400 nm where
transmissivity was recorded as 0 % in such a wavelength band, and then
its value suddenly showed a sharp rise. Also, the nanoparticle size no
longer affects Knf
whereupon are very low (< 0.05). Authors concluded that as the Knf
e  is
not  influenced  by  small  scattering  values,  the  nanoparticle  size  has  a
negligible effect on Knf
e  of a
nanofluid,  basically,  is  governed  by  its  concentration  and  the  optical
constants (n and κ) of its components rather than the nanoparticle size.
Other  studies  were  found  to  agree  with  the  previous  discussion.  For
instance,  Ladjevardi  et  al.  [49]  investigated  the  effect  of  graphite
nanoparticle size ranged from 50 to 300 nm for a nanofluid of 0.0001 %
volume  fraction  employed  in  a  DASC.  Authors  used  the  Rayleigh
approximation for which to be valid the nanoparticle diameter should be
smaller than 159 nm and 318 nm for incident radiation wavelengths of
0.5  and  1  μm,  respectively.  Results  clearly  manifested  that  the

s  when wavelengths are above 550 nm, and Knf

e . Similarly, Lenert [315] observed that Knf

s  values

nanoparticle size has no effect on the Knf
e  for wavelengths above 1.25
μm. However, for shorter wavelengths, increasing the nanoparticle size
causes  the  Knf
e  to  remarkably  increase,  which  means  that  the  energy
absorption ability increases.

On the other hand, several studies offered in literature were found in
disagreement  with  the  previous  discussion.  For  example,  Howe  et  al.
[316]  experimentally  tested  the  radiative  characteristics  of  ion-
ic-liquid/Al2O3  nanofluids  with  different  sizes  of  spherical  Al2O3
nanoparticles (10, 30, 60, and 90 nm). Results showed that absorbance
values  of  such  a  nanofluid  showed  significant  variations  with  the
nanoparticle  size  only  in  short-wavelength  regions.  However,  the
strongest absorption ability was shown by the nanofluid of the smallest
nanoparticle size (∼ 10 nm). The largest nanoparticle (∼ 90 nm) showed
the highest transmittance and thus the lowest Ke. This contradicts the
conclusion  of  Ladjevardi  et  al.  [49]  who  found  that  increasing  the
graphite nanoparticle size increased the extinction coefficient, as shown
earlier.  Furthermore,  Otanicar  et  al.  [34]  experimentally  reported  an
inverse relationship between the nanoparticle size and the DASC’s ηPC,
where an enhancement of 6 % in the collector’s ηPC is obtained when Ag
nanoparticle  is  reduced  from  40  to  20  nm.  This  is  attributed  to  the
dramatic increase of the absorption area due to employing nanofluids in
DASC where authors reported a 300 times greater surface area than the
DASC bottom when using nanoparticles of 30 nm size and 1 % volume
fraction,  as  illustrated  in  Fig.  20.  Also,  Chen  et  al.  [84]  stated  that
volumetric absorption desires smaller nanoparticles (specifically, 30–40
nm) as their scattering cross-sections are negligible compared to their
absorption ones. Similar conclusion is found in Chen et al. [317].

Given these contradictions offered in literature, it can be concluded
that the Rayleigh approach used in the previous theoretical studies is a
weak tool to predict the radiative behavior of a nanofluid due to the gap
between the predictive model assumptions and actual reality, especially,
in the UV band where the high light extinction is due to light scattering
[98,318]. Therefore, optical behaviors depicted based on the Rayleigh
approach should be taken with caution.

As for thermal properties of nanofluids, the nanoparticle size plays a
considerable  role in the  determination of  their enhancements. Specif-
ically, its increase adversely affects the properties enhancements caused
by nanoparticles [319]. It can be stated that smaller nanoparticles result
in nanofluids with higher thermal conductivity and higher heat transfer
rates [163,320,321]. This is justified by the fact that smaller particles
result in a greater interfacial surface area between the particles and base
fluid which boosts heat transfer rates [322]. Moreover, the Brownian
motion  has  a  stronger  effect  on  smaller  particles  creating  convection
currents  that  enhance  the  thermal  transport  and,  consequently,  the
thermal conductivity [323]. Wang et al. [318] supported such justifi-
cations built based on the Brownian motion since larger nanoparticles
mean  narrower  specific  surface  areas  and  slower  motion,  which  both
negatively affect the heat transfer process in the nanofluid and lead to a
reduction in the improvement rate of thermal conductivity. As for the
viscosity  (μ),  studies  systematically  examining  the  impact  of  nano-
particle size on nanofluid μ  have been reviewed by Koca et al. [324].
Discrepancies in μ  values have been noted among these studies, even
when fV  values similar. The data gathered also reveals that, for identical
nanofluid  samples,  μ  can  exhibit  variations  of  up  to  a  40  %  increase
[325] or a 37 % decrease [326] solely due to changes in particle size.

As inferred from the previous survey, since light absorption ability
and enhancement rate in heat transfer can be increased by employing
smaller-sized  nanoparticles  [67,163],  the  nanoparticle  size  should  be
reduced for the nanofluid to exhibit the optimal radiative and thermal
behavior. However, this has a negative impact in terms of nanoparticles’
toxicity  danger  to  ecosystem  and  human  life.  The  toxicity  of  nano-
particles increases as their size decreases. Less than 10 nm-sized nano-
particles behave like gases that can more easily enter the human body
through skin contact and inhaling. As a result, they harm cells with their
poisonous instinct. This danger issues a warning that the harmful effects

of nanoparticles on the environment and human health should be taken
into account.

5.4. Nanoparticle shape

The  nanoparticle  shape  is  one  of  the  main  factors  that  form  the
interaction between nanoparticles and their carrier fluid, which has a
main  role  in  the  determination  of  nanofluid  characteristics.  Although
many studies considered it as  a crucial parameter for thermal perfor-
mance control and heat transfer optimization, no consistent conclusion
could be drawn as of yet regarding the influence of nanoparticle shape
on  the  hydrothermal  performance  of  thermal  systems  [327].  Starting
with the optical properties, this effect was early studied in the literature
by investigating nanoparticles of various shapes including nano-spheres,
nano-prisms, nano-stars, nano-wires, and nano-rods. Wang et al. [328]
used the Mie theory and the finite difference time domain technique to
calculate the solar absorption efficiency factor of six different-shape Au
nanoparticles (namely, ellipse, tetrahedron, triangular, 5-sided equilat-
eral  polygon,  octahedron,  cross,  and  star).  Results  showed  that
tetrahedron-shaped  nanoparticles  resulted  in  the  greatest  absorption
efficiency factor. Qin et al. [329] presented a numerical investigation of
the absorption efficiency of sharp-edged Ag nanoparticles employed in a
DASC.  Results  revealed  that  such  nanoparticles  can  produce  several
absorption peaks over the solar spectrum as both LSPR and lightning rod
effects exist. Sharper edges, that can be created by decreasing the cur-
vature radius or the edge angle, mean a higher lightning rod effect and
thus a greater number of absorption peaks, and thus higher absorption
ability [321,330]. However, creating more edges is not a guarantee of
broader  absorption.  Authors  stated  that core/shell  configuration (i.e.,
four-edged SiO2-core/Ag-shell) further broadens solar absorption over
Ag four-edged nanoparticles, nano-rods, and nano-spheres, as shown in
Fig.  26.  Also,  DASCs  employing  four-edge  or  four-edged  core/shell
nanoparticles result in Am  values higher than those employing smooth
nanoparticles  (namely,  nano-spheres  and  nano-rods).  Calculations
revealed that Am  of a DASC employing four-edged nanoparticles is 35 %
and  20  %  greater  than  those  employing  nano-spheres  and  nano-rods,
(cid:0) 6. Furthermore, Sun et al. [275] showed that the
respectively, at fV  10
core-shell  composite  nanorods  outperformed  ordinary  nanorods  in
terms of solar energy absorption capacity, particularly in the visible light
and near-IR regions. The 5-ppm composite nanorods suspension, with a
20 mm optical thickness, achieved a solar absorption of up to 95.3 % of
the incident light, marking a 9 % increase over ordinary Au nanorods.
These results suggest that core-shell composite nanorods hold promise
for  improving  DASC  solar  energy  absorption  efficiency.  Additionally,
the study highlighted the sensitivity of solar energy absorption capacity
to  imperfect  shells,  with  larger  imperfections  causing  a  maximum

reduction of about 31 %.

Researchers suggest novel nanoparticle shapes to induce the LSPR
effect. Zou et al. [331] investigated a hollow spherical structure TiN/-
water nanofluid with fV  of 5 ppm and nanoparticles of inner diameter
and  thickness  of  10  and  5  nm,  respectively.  Notably,  the  nanofluid
exhibited remarkable stability, with multiple LSPRs observed on both
inner and outer surfaces. Importantly, the ηPC,max achieved was 92.64 %,
surpassing that of solid TiN by 7.18 %.

As for heat transfer rate, Zahmatkesh et al. [327] concluded that the
platelet-like nanoparticle obtained the highest heat transfer rate in the
majority  of  earlier  experiments  in  the  natural  and  forced  convection
regimes.  However,  the  majority  of  research  in  the  mixed  convection
regime  found  that  the  blade-like  nanoparticle  had  the  superior  heat
transfer performance. As for the impacts on thermophysical properties,
the literature revealed that the nanoparticle shape has significant im-
pacts  on  the  kc,  μ,  and  ρ  of  nanofluids.  Maheshwari  et  al.  [321]
concluded that 5.54 % of the enhancement in thermal conductivity is
due  to  the  nanoparticle  shape.  Authors  investigated  three  different
shapes (i.e., cubes, spheres, and rods) of TiO2  nanoparticles seeded in
water with the same fV. Nanoparticles of different shapes have different
surface areas. The cubic particles have a greater surface area than the
cylindrical particle which, in turn, has a greater surface area than the
spherical  one.  Cubic  nanoparticles  are  preferable  in  thermal  systems
since they are more stable and show less tendency to agglomerate. Re-
sults  showed  that,  due  to  their  larger  surface  area,  cubic  TiO2  nano-
particles provided the greatest thermal conductivity compared to rods
and spheres, as illustrated in Fig. 27a. Similar comparisons in terms of
thermal conductivity showed the superiority of rectangular ZnO nano-
particles over spherical ones [332], and superiority of banana-shaped
SiO2  nanoparticles over spherical ones [333]. In the study outlined in
Ref. [321], it was found that the viscosity of the nanofluid is affected by
the  shape  of  the  nanoparticles.  Specifically,  the  use  of  cubic  TiO2
nanoparticles resulted in a higher viscosity compared to spherical and
cylindrical shapes, as depicted in Fig. 27b. Authors attributed that to the
higher difficulty of rotation suffered by cubic nanoparticles in compar-
ison with spherical and cylindrical ones,  which causes a  higher resis-
tance to the nanofluid flow and thus a higher viscosity.

Furthermore, Abbasi et al. [334] conducted a molecular dynamics
simulation to reveal the effect of the nanoparticle shape on the nanofluid
density. The investigation revealed that planar nanoparticles possess the
most  concentrated  nano-layer  density  among  others  studied  (namely,
planar, spherical, and rod-shaped nanoparticles), potentially attributed
to their flat, curvature-free surfaces. Consequently, it is evident that, in
addition to factors such as surface-area-to-volume ratio and aspect ratio,
nanoparticle  surface  curvature  is  a  significant  parameter  worthy  of
consideration. The findings of this study contribute to the advancement
of our understanding of nanofluids and their industrial applications.

In light of understanding the performance of a nanofluid based on
the dispersed nanoparticle shape, the effect of the nanoparticle shape on
the DASC performance can further be discussed. For example, Campos
et al. [273] investigated both spherical and cubic Ag based nanofluids
with  the  same  concentration  and  found  that  the  cubic  nanoparticles
resulted in a higher-performance DASC in terms of the temperature gain
and  ηPC,  as  shown  in  Fig.  28a  and  b,  over  that  using  spherical
nanoparticles.

5.5. Nanoparticle loading

The  nanoparticle  loading,  i.e.  nanofluid  concentration  or  volume
fraction (fV), is the most important parameter that determines the OTPs
of  a  nanofluid  and  thus  the  performance  of  nanofluid-based  DASCs
[260]. The earliest research attempts in the DASC field took care of the
effect of fV  on the DASC performance and could elaborate the nature of
the relationship between them. Tyagi et al. [57] stated that the collec-
tor’s ηPC  exhibits a rapid increase as fV  escalates, ultimately converging

towards  an  approximate  maximum  of  80  %  at  the  upper  limit  of  the
studied  fv  range  (0.1–5  %).  The  augmentation  of  fV  leads  to  an
augmented attenuation of incident sunlight within the collector, thereby
enhancing  collector’s  ηPC.  This  relationship  is  governed  by  an  expo-
nential  dependence  on  the  extinction  coefficient,  which  is,  in  turn,
directly proportional to fV  according to Eq. (3) (authors used Rayleigh
approximation in their model). Consequently, the collector’s ηPC  expe-
rienced  an  initial  steep  ascent  at  lower  fV,  eventually  plateauing  at
higher  fV  values.  This  means  that  there  is  no  point  of  adding  more
nanoparticles to the suspension after a certain limit. For the particular
nanofluid under investigation, composed of water and 5 nm Al nano-
particles, this critical limit stands at around 2 %. Similar behavior was
observed by Otanicar et al. [34] who concluded that ηPC  enhancement
continues only up to a certain fV  threshold, beyond which an elevated
portion of incident solar radiation is reflected by the nanofluid. Conse-
quently,  this  reflection-induced  phenomenon  leads  to  a  reduction  in
DASC’s ηPC  (see Fig. 20). Also, Chen et al. [199] provided similar results
and  justifications  when  examined  Ag  nanofluids  featuring  10  nm
nanoparticles and a collector height of 6 mm. They found that a realistic

fV  of 0.03 % suffices to attain 90 % of the maximum efficiency across
different time intervals. Therefore, sensible fV  selection should be a key
consideration  for  practical  DASCs,  balancing  the  advantages  of
enhanced ηPC  against the associated increase in nanoparticle cost [199].
The  fV  variations  cause  many  interrelated  impacts  on  DASCs  per-
formance. Many of such impacts were discussed by Sharaf et al. [100],
who presented a numerical analysis of a DASC with several nanofluids of
fV  values ranged from 0.0005 to 2 %. As depicted in Fig. 29b, the initial
augmentation in fV  results in a substantial ηPC  boost, irrespective of the
choice of base fluid (indicated by the red narrow bars, which represent
results  when  therminol  VP-1  is  utilized  as  the  base  fluid  rather  than
water). Nevertheless, as fV  reaches relatively higher levels, subsequent
increments  exert diminishing effects  on performance. As fV  increases,
the light absorption ability of the nanofluid increases and thus the ab-
sorption  path  length  decreases  as  most  of  the  incident  radiation  is
absorbed by y the uppermost layers of the nanofluid (near the collector
top  surface  rather  than  within  the  nanofluid  bulk  volume).  Conse-
quently,  this  elevates  the  average  temperature  of  the  top  surface,
causing  increased  thermal  losses  to  surroundings.  Nonetheless,  at  a

specific fV, the disparity between thermal losses to the environment and
the useful temperature gain of the collector reaches its peak, resulting in
the  maximum  collector’s  ηPC.  Beyond  this  optimal  fV  threshold  (e.g.,
approximately 0.05 % for graphite, 0.5 % for copper and aluminum, and
2 % for silver), the thermal losses to surroundings become dominant. As
fV  continues to rise, the collector’s volumetric performance approaches
that of a conventional surface collector [34]. Authors [100] argued that
the optimal fV  greatly depends on Knp
e . Consequently, a graphite nano-
fluid with a low fV  is anticipated to yield the same efficiency as a silver
nanofluid  with  fV  approximately  40  times  greater.  This  expectation
arises from the former’s superior broadband solar radiation absorption
capabilities  compared  to  the  latter,  as  results  showed.  Consequently,
they concluded that, at the optimum fV  (for a constant nanofluid film
height),  a  DASC  attains  the  same  ηPC,max,  irrespective  of  nanoparticle
material type. Moreover, as illustrated in Fig. 29a, at lower fV values, the
temperature distribution exhibits greater uniformity, and solar radiation
penetrates deeper into the collector channel. In essence, the pathlength
traversed by solar radiation is extended. Conversely, with increasing fV,
the temperature distribution becomes more irregular due to the dimin-
ished  solar  radiation  pathlength,  with  a  greater  portion  of  the  solar
energy being absorbed by the uppermost layers. Similar behaviors were

found in the results reported in Refs. [59,85,154,209,284,335,336].

As for additional interlinked factors and impacts, investigations by
Sharaf et al. [138] revealed that elevating fV  substantially enhances the
DASC’s solar absorption ability. Notably, at high fV, collector’s ηPC  ex-
hibits an asymptotic rise owing to heightened thermal conductivity. This
behavior arises from the preferential solar energy absorption by the top
nanofluid layers, which subsequently transfer heat to the lower layers,
thereby  diminishing  heat  loss  to  the  surroundings  and  elevating  effi-
ciency. Conversely, at lower fV, the thermal conductivity has a minor
effect  on  DASC’s  ηPC,  whereas  emissivity  emerges  as  a  crucial  factor.
Increasing  emissivity  enhances  heat  transfer  from  the  lower  to  upper
layers,  and  consequently,  heightened  thermal  conductivity  leads  to
reduced collector’s ηPC. Thus, at low fV  and low emissivity levels, the
nanofluid thermal conductivity exerts minimal influence on DASC’s ηPC.
Nevertheless, higher emissivity introduces a more pronounced interplay
with thermal conductivity, further impacting DASC’s ηPC.

As  for  economic  aspects,  Ladjevardi  et  al.  [49]  observed  that
increasing fV of graphite nanofluid from 0.00025 to 0.0025 % resulted in
a $0.405 per liter increase in DASC cost, while concurrently raising the

many  authors  stated  that  at  high  fV  values,  viscosity  rises  since  the
nanofluid’s  non-Newtonian  behavior  becomes  more  prevalent  [324,
337–339], and thus, the pressure drop of the nanofluid flow and needed
pumping  power  increase  [31,303,340].  However,  Sharaf  et  al.  [100]
revealed  that,  for  DASC  systems,  the  increment  in  pumping  power
associated with employing a nanofluid due to the increase in viscosity is
by no means significant. Consequently, enhancement in DASC perfor-
mance is much greater than the increase in pumping power. In conclu-
sion,  fV  is  effective  up  to  the  value  of  1  wt%  beyond  which  the
performance starts to deteriorate, as reviewed by Hussain et al. [67].

5.6. Collector length

DASC  investigations  revealed  that  the  collector  length  (L)  has  an
important role in determining its ηPC. The DASC performance exhibits an
enhancement as L increases up to a certain limit beyond which the ef-
ficiency starts to deteriorate. Increasing L means increasing the surface
area exposed to radiation and thus capturing more amounts of energy
absorbed. However, at a certain L, the increment in heat losses to sur-
rounding, due to the increase in surface area exposed to ambient, be-
comes faster than the increment in energy absorbed, which foreshadows
a decline in efficiency. Increasing L implies, for the working fluid, longer
periods of sunlight exposure, which results in higher temperatures at the
DASC  exit  [281].  Studies  stated  that  there  are  optimum  L  values  at
which  the  efficiency  is  maximum.  Tyagi  et  al.  [57]  confirmed  the
aforementioned  discussion  in  their  pioneer  study  discussed  earlier.
Moreover, Bhalla et al. [284] reported the behavior of temperature gain,
heat loss, and ηPC  of a DASC with L varying from 0.5 to 2.5 m. The au-
thors found that the temperature gain increases with L, however, the
efficiency of the system decreases due to the increase in thermal losses
with the increase in L.

Sharaf  et  al.  [138],  additionally,  presented  an  optimization  study
suggesting that a sensible flow velocity selection should be compatible
with  L  for  DASC  to  harness  the  greatest  amount  of  useful  power.  In
Fig. 30, authors elucidated the impact of L on energy and exergy effi-
ciencies, power and temperature gains, using a reflective bottom surface
and  graphite  nanoparticles  at  various  flow  velocities.  In  Fig.  30a,  an
extension of L results in a declining energy efficiency (i.e., photothermal
conversion efficiency, ηPC), with a steeper decline observed at lower flow
velocities. This trend stems from the increased radiation absorption and

temperature of the upper fluid layers, leading to elevated thermal losses
to  surroundings.  Fig.  30b  and  d,  illustrating  power  and  temperature
gains, respectively, demonstrate an initial rise followed by a leveling off
after  a  specific  L.  Fig.  30b  reveals  that  the  asymptotic  power  gain  is
higher at greater flow velocities, with a longer L required to reach the
asymptotic power gain for higher flow velocities. Fig. 30d, on the other
hand,  shows  that  the  asymptotic  temperature  gain  remains  constant,
irrespective  of  flow  velocity.  Nevertheless,  achieving  this  asymptotic
temperature gain demands a longer collector as flow velocity increases.
Thus, Fig. 30b and d imply that a proportional increase in flow velocity
is  crucial  when  extending  L.  To  harness  thermal  energy  suitable  for
practical  applications,  it  is  essential  to  consider  power  gain,  ηPC,  and
temperature gain collectively. Fig. 30c highlights the achievement of a
balanced  trade-off  between  these  three  performance  parameters  at  L
corresponding to the maximum exergy efficiency. For instance, within
the  explored  parameter  range,  L  values  maximizing  exergy  efficiency
yield energy efficiencies of 58 % and temperature gains of 28
C, irre-
spective of flow velocity. Similarly, Bårdsgård et al. [154] revealed that
ηPC  of the investigated DASC grew up to 87 % at maximum when the
flow velocity increased to 3 cm/s. However, any increase in the velocity
beyond this limit will result in a diminishing efficiency.

◦

A  comprehensive  examination  of  existing  literature  reveals  con-
flicting  trends  in  the  thermal  performance  characteristics  of  DASCs
concerning the influence of L. Notably, the results discussed above and
studies conducted by Qin et al. [146], Jeon et al. [144], and Lee and
Jang [210] have reported a consistent decrease in ηPC  with an extended
L. This stands in contrast to findings of Gorji and Ranjbar [126], who
concluded  that  efficiency  actually  improves  with  an  increase  in  L,
particularly at greater collector heights. In light of such contradictions,
Sharaf et al. [138] conducted further calculations trying to spotlight the
exact  response  of  DASC  performance  to  L  variations  taking  into
consideration changes of other interlinked parameters such as fV  and hL.
Authors concluded that, at higher fV, increased L consistently reduces
ηPC  due to heightened temperatures in the top nanofluid layers, exposed
to  surroundings,  where  most  light-absorption  occurs  (Fig.  31a).
Conversely,  at  lower  fV,  greater  light-absorption  occurs  within  the
nanofluid bulk and at the collector bottom surface, promoting thermal
trapping and leading to a rise in ηPC  with increasing L (Fig. 31c). For
moderate fV, the impact of L on ηPC  exhibits a rise followed by a decline,
resulting from the combined effects of elevated top layer temperatures

and  thermal  trapping  (Fig.  31b).  The  relationship  between  L  and  the
energy  efficiency  (i.e.,  photothermal  conversion  efficiency,  ηPC)  is
influenced by fV  and hL, potentially resulting in a rise, drop, or a rise
followed by a drop in efficiency.

5.7. Collector height

In  their  pioneer  work,  Tyagi  et  al.  [57]  systematically  varied  the
collector height, or thickness, (H) from 0.2 mm to approximately 5 mm.
The collector’s ηPC  demonstrated an increasing trend with H, eventually
reaching  an  asymptotic  value  of  around  80  %.  This  behavior  can  be
explained as follows: Observations from previous studies highlighted the
reduction  in  spectral  sunlight  intensity  as  it  traverses  through  the
nanofluid  [57].  Consequently,  solar  collectors  with  greater  depths
experience heightened sunlight attenuation. This attenuation occurs due
to  the  direct  absorption  of  solar  energy  by  the  nanofluid,  leading  to
temperature  elevation.  Consequently,  any  reduction  in  sunlight  in-
tensity  translates  into  elevated  fluid  temperatures  and,  consequently,
enhanced efficiencies. Additionally, the spectral intensity of sunlight, as
described by the RTE, follows an exponential then asymptotic attenua-
tion pattern. Chen et al. [199] confirmed the findings and the asymptotic
trend discussed above, indicating the presence of an optimum H. Au-
thors investigated a DASC employing a silver nanofluid of 0.03 % con-
centration and reported an optimum H of 10 mm resulting in ηPC,max  of
90 %. Additionally, Gorji and Ranjbar [126] obtained similar behavior
when  they  analyzed  a  DASC  employing  a  distilled-water/graphite
nanofluid  with  fV  of  0.1  %  reporting  a  ηPC,max  of  78.06  %  at  the
optimal H (∼ 2 cm). Bårdsgård et al. [154] reported an optimum DASC H
of 300 μm with ηPC,max  of 68 %. Duan et al. [341] investigated a plas-
monic  core-shell  (SiO2–Au)  nanofluid  of  0.01  %  concentration  and
stated that DASC reached its ηPC,max  at H of 10 mm. Moreover, Delfani
et  al.  [342]  built  an  artificial  neural  network  to  predict  the  thermal
performance  variations  of  a  DASC  employing  graphene  oxide  (GO)
nanoparticles  against  geometric  parameters.  They  confirmed  the

well-established  observations  regarding  H  effect  and  found  that,  at
and fV of 45 lit/h and 500 ppm, respectively, the DASC efficiency and Nu
grew by 9 % and 58 %, respectively, when H increased from 5 mm to 15
mm. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 32, Li et al. [343] observed that as H
increases,  the  optimal  mass  fraction  of  the  MXene-based  nanofluid

collector heights under the same

To sum up, the studies above, in addition to others [28,110,137,146,
294], concluded that the ηPC  of the DASC increases with H. Sharaf et al.
[262] agreed the previous conclusion, however, they presented justifi-
cations considering other interrelated factors such as the bottom wall
type and fV. For a collector with a fully absorptive bottom, increased
thermal  losses  occur  due  to  higher  top-layer  temperatures  when  the
nanofluid film is thinner (Fig. 33e) compared to thicker films (Fig. 33f).
In  contrast,  for  collectors with  fully  reflective  or  transparent  bottoms
and relatively low-to-medium fV, escaped radiation losses increase as H
decreases,  resulting  from  reduced  light  travel  distance  through  the
nanofluid. At higher fV, thicker nanofluid films allow more efficient heat
transfer from hot top to cold bottom layers, as evident in the comparison
between  thin films  (Fig.  33a and c)  and thick  films (Fig.  33b and  d).

depict thinner nanofluid films (0.5 mm), and panels (b, d, f) depict thicker films (10 mm) [262]. (Reused with permission from Elsevier).

Consequently,  ηPC  of  a  collector  with  a  purely  absorptive  bottom  is
constrained  by  thermal  losses  (irrespective  of  fV),  whereas  that  of  a
collector with purely reflective or transmissive bottoms is constrained
by escaped radiation losses at low-to-medium fV and by thermal losses at
higher fV. As a consequence, collectors with thicker films consistently
exhibit higher ηPC  values, irrespective of fV.

5.8. Collector design

This section discusses the impact of the DASC geometric design on its
performance and shows novel designs offered in the literature. Cregan
and  Myers  [137]  analytically  analyzed  an  inclined  low-flux  DASC,  as
discussed earlier, and found that the DASC inclination angle insignifi-
cantly  influences  its  performance.  Struchalin  et  al.  [224]  assessed  a
custom tubular DASC employing a carbon-based nanofluid for enhanced
performance.  With  a  MWCNT  particle  loading  of  0.01  %,  the  DASC
demonstrated an average photothermal conversion efficiency of 80 %.
Compared  to  a  surface  absorption  collector  with  similar  temperature
differences, the tubular DASC exhibited significantly higher efficiency
by up to 37.9 %. Notably, the optimal fV  was found to be dependent on
the  specific  DASC  geometry  and  required  experimental  or  numerical
determination.  Additionally,  the  tubular  collector  design  promoted
efficient  phase  mixing,  although  there  were  slight  discrepancies  be-
tween predicted and experimental optimal fV  values, with the experi-
mental  value  slightly  higher  at  0.01  %  due  to  experimental
uncertainties. Kumar et al. [344] introduced three innovative water/-
Al2O3  nanofluid-based DASC designs and compared them to a conven-
tional  solar  collector.  The  circular-corrugated  collector  achieved  the
highest peak efficiency of 85 % at a velocity of 0.08 m/s, surpassing the
triangular-corrugated, trapezoidal-corrugated, and flat-plate collectors
by approximately 5, 11, and 16 %, respectively. Also, authors observed
changes in the deposition rate with the collector configuration.

◦

Wang et al. [345] investigated the photothermal characteristics of
titanium nitride nanofluids using thermal transfer oil as the base fluid at
varying solar irradiation levels. Under 5 suns irradiation (i.e., 5000 W),
the  surface  layer  reached  around  160
C,  creating  a  significant  tem-
perature  gradient  within
to
lower-than-expected ηPC  in the collector. To address these challenges,
they  introduced  a  novel  approach  called  reverse  irradiation  DASC
(RI-DASC),  facilitating  a  transition  from  thermal  conduction  to  free
convection heat transfer within the fluid. In conventional DASCs, solar
irradiation penetrates the fluid from top to bottom, leading to energy
absorption  concentrated  in  the  upper  fluid  layers  rather  than  in  the

the  fluid.  This  condition

lower ones. Therefore, and since heat conduction is the primary  heat
transfer mode in such a case, the temperature of upper fluid layers re-
mains high, which results in higher losses and thus a lower efficiency. In
contrast, RI-DASCs direct irradiation towards the collector’s bottom, as
shown in Fig. 34, creating a hotter fluid layer at the base. This induces
buoyancy in the opposite direction to gravity, resulting in a unique form
of  free  convection  known  as  Rayleigh-Bernard  convection  within  the
fluid.  This  phenomenon  disrupts  the  fluid’s  steady-state,  with  macro

convection taking precedence over thermal conduction as the dominant
heat transfer mechanism. Consequently, a uniform temperature field is
established,  significantly  enhancing  the  fluid’s  internal  energy.  This
mechanism ensures that the heated liquid consistently moves away from
the irradiated surface layer, ultimately leading to superior absorption
performance  compared  to  traditional  DASCs.  Authors,  particularly,
found that the investigated 4.0 cm deep conventional DASC experienced
temperature  difference  of  approximately  50
C  between  the  top  and
bottom layers. In contrast, the RI-DASC achieved a maximum temper-
ature  exceeding  the  medium-temperature  for  various  working  fluids,
with  a  minimal  interlayer  temperature  difference  of  about  5
C.  The
RI-DASC  exhibited  a  significantly  improved  temperature  distribution
due to the presence of Rayleigh-Bernard convection, facilitating uniform
heat distribution within the collector.

Additionally, Qu et al. [346] examined a tubular MXene Ti3C2/DI--
water nanofluid DASC with reverse irradiation and obtained ηPC,max  of
◦
reverse irradiation angle, i.e., 63.5 %
83.9 % at 220 ppm loading and 60
greater  than  that  of  water.  Furthermore,  Peng  and  Sadaghiani  [347]
introduced a novel DASC featuring two linear parabolic reflectors (LPR)
designed to enhance its ηPC. This innovative collector incorporated an
insulated wall and a cavity-like receiver tube to minimize energy losses.
Sun-ray tracing was conducted mathematically, with numerical simu-
lations executed using COMSOL software to explore various influential
parameters.  The  DASC  design  comprised  two  parabolic  mirrors  with
overlapping  focus  points,  a  cavity-like  receiver  tube  composed  of
concentric  glass  tubes,  and  reflective  metal  sheets  coating  the  tubes
(Fig. 35). The utilization of dual concave mirrors in two stages effec-
tively  concentrated  incident  sunlight  into  the  receiver  tube.  The  ad-
vantages of this novel DASC are twofold. First, it eliminated radiative
and convective losses by virtue of the cavity-like receiver tube. Second,
it  facilitated  a  more  uniform  distribution  of  volumetric  heat  flux,
resulting in higher efficiency. Additionally, the collector’s design mini-
mized heat loss through the insulated wall and extended the sunray path
length  through sequential reflections, thereby improving solar energy
absorption by the working fluid. The study demonstrated that the pro-
posed DASC design could achieve higher ηPC  by up to 7 % compared to
conventional counterparts, with the proposed DASC reaching ηPC  of up
to 81 %.

A further modification on the conventional DASC was performed by
applying a magnetic field which further escalates its ηPC  [348]. Wang
et al. [349] by introducing a separation tank into an experimental setup

as  a  new  way  for  employing  magnetic  nanofluids  in  DASCs.  They
incorporated a rotating magnetic field as an external convective system
to achieve non-uniform solar irradiation (Fig. 36). This modification led
to a notable increase in ηPC, with gains of up to 12.8 %. The key factor
behind this improvement is the shift in the heat transfer mechanism of
working  fluids  from  conduction  to  thermal  convection,  resulting  in
reduced  heat  loss  to  surroundings.  Additionally,  this  method  proved
effective in mitigating flow losses and pipeline blockages. Furthermore,
the application of an electric field was found to be beneficial in DASCs.
Chen et al. [350] examined a tubular thermal oil/Al2O3 nanofluid-based
DASC  with  electric  field.  Authors  stated  that  the  electric  field
re-suspends  deposited  colloids  and  enhances  heat  transfer  between
upper and lower nanoparticles. They found that the temperature gain
◦
and ηPC rose up to 62.1
C and 87.8 % when applying 10 kV electric field,
which  are  19.2  and  14.2  %  greater  than  those  with  no  electric  field,
respectively.

Hatami and Jing [205] conducted thermal performance simulations
of a wavy bottom wall DASC. In comparison with a conventional DASC,
results showed that local Nusselt numbers were higher at the peak points
of the collector channel waves due to the angle at which waves influ-
enced heat absorption. In another study, same authors [351] optimized
the wavy bottom plate profile of a wavy DASC using response surface
methodology  (RSM)  analysis.  Employing  central  composite  design
(CCD),  they  assessed  collector  performance  across  nine  cases  with
varying wave amplitudes and wave numbers. Their findings indicated
that the highest local and average Nu were attained with a smaller fV  of
Al2O3  nanofluid in the optimal case characterized by an average wave
number and small amplitude. Apart from this design, Hooshmand et al.
[352]  studied  a  domestic  SiC  nanofluid  DASC  filled  with  SiC  porous
foam.  They  found  that  such  a  technology  enhanced  the  thermal  per-
formance of the DASC and diminished losses. Experiments recorded the
maximum increase in the DASC photothermal conversion efficiency by
virtue of porous foam and nanofluid to be 14 % and 37 %, respectively. It
can be found in the literature that heat transfer enhancements in such
cavities  depend  highly  on  porosity  [353,354]  and  less  on  the  wave
number [355]. Nevertheless Bozorgi et al. [356] combined the previous
two technologies together yielding a synergistic effect. They proposed a
novel  DASC  design  featuring  a  wavy  bottom  shape  filled  with  an
aluminum  porous  medium  (Fig.  37).  Bozorgi  et  al.  [356]  study
employed  COMSOL  software  and  Design  of  Experiments  (DoE)  tech-
niques to optimize key parameters, including fV, bottom wave number,

conversion efficiency and temperature gain of up to 56.5 % and 170
respectively. Also, experimental results revealed that approximately 52
%  of  thermal  energy  was  stored  in  the  molten  salt,  significantly
enhancing thermal  storage capabilities  of DASCs and  expanding their
potential for medium-temperature applications. The molten salt was an
interesting  choice  as  Ali  et  al.  [358]  concluded,  in  their  review,  that
molten  salts  are  the  best  candidates  for  solar  thermal  energy  storage
systems.

Siavashi et al. [184] investigated, among others, the effect of pres-
ence of an Al absorption sheet in a DASC system. They stated that ηPC  of
pure water based DASC increases when the absorber plate is in the DASC
bottom. However, the opposite is happening when using a nanofluid.
Simonetti et al. [45] proposed the adoption of an annular pipe creating a
triple tube DASC (Fig. 39) to enhance DASCs thermal performance from
the bulk temperature viewpoint. Investigations showed that the external
surface temperature at the exit section of the triple tube DASC was 1.5 K
higher than the average temperature of the same tube section. However,
it was 20 K higher in case of the conventional double tube configuration.
Qin  et  al.  [359]  introduced  a  novel  collector  by  utilizing  a
semi-cylindrical  absorbing  coating  on  a  dual-tube  direct  absorption
parabolic trough solar collector (DAPTSC) to gather both volumetric and
surface solar radiation absorption (Fig. 40a). When applied in the AO
configuration (Fig. 40c), this absorbing coating notably enhanced Am,
particularly when absorption coefficients are low. As a result, the AO
configuration achieved superior ηPC  compared to the RO configuration
with a reflective coating (Fig. 40b) over a wide temperature range. This
innovative  hybrid  DAPTSC  design  offers  benefits  in  terms  of  reduced
nanoparticle  concentration  requirements  and  improved  solar  thermal
harvesting in the medium-to high-temperature range.

It can be observed from the discussion above that the collector design
is  a  key  parameter  in  determining  the  performance  of  DASC  [67].  In
addition  to  the  low-flux  DASCs  discussed  above,  Rasih  et  al.  [360]
reviewed the studies  in literature concerning the concentrating DASC
systems including parabolic dish, Fresnel collectors, parabolic-trough,
etc.

6. Effects of flow properties and operating parameters on the
DASC performance

This section discusses the impacts of flow properties and operating

parameters on the optical and thermal performance of DASCs.

6.1. Flow rate

The rate of nanofluid flow in a DASC is one of the parameters that

design  approach.  The  findings  revealed  that  reducing  porosity  and
increasing fV  led to improved collector’s photothermal conversion effi-
ciency. However, higher wave amplitude and wave number resulted in
increased pressure drop. Ultimately, the integration of a porous medium
and a wavy bottom with nanofluid enhanced the DASC’s ηPC  from 52 %
to 93.7 %.

Zhang  et  al.  [357]  introduced  a  novel  DASC  system  using  a
GO-TiN/oil  hybrid  nanofluid  with  heat  storage  capability.  The  heat
storage core consisted of a ternary mixed molten salt (44 % Ca(NO3)2,
12 % NaNO3, and 44 % KNO3). The DASC’s photothermal performance
was  evaluated  using  a  simulated  photothermal  conversion  system,  as
depicted in Fig. 38. The collector structure comprises an outer quartz
container, an inner cuvette, and light-absorbing nanofluids in the central
section. The cuvette’s interior is filled with the ternary molten salt acting

including ηPC, outlet temperature, and losses to surroundings. Delfani
 ̇
et al. [59] examined the impact of flow rate (
V) on the collector outlet
temperature and ηPC at a 10 mm collector height and a 100 ppm MWCNT
loading.  The  results  revealed  a  decrease  in  outlet  temperature  with
increasing   ̇V. This behavior can be explained by the residence time of the

V, the fluid spends more
working fluid within the collector. At lower
time inside the collector, allowing for greater temperature elevation. As
the  temperature  increases,  heat  loss  to  surroundings,  including  both
convective  and  radiative  losses,  becomes  more  pronounced.  Notably,
radiative  heat  loss  from  the  fluid  increases  significantly  with

 ̇
temperature, following a fourth-power relation. Consequently, lower
V
values result in elevated losses from DASC, leading to reduced collector
efficiencies. Conversely, at higher   ̇V, the temperature increment within
the  fluid  is  more  modest.  Consequently,  the  impact  of  the  aforemen-
tioned heat losses diminishes progressively, resulting in higher collector
efficiencies.  Interestingly,  the  analysis  of  zero-loss  collector  ηPC  indi-
cated that the reduction in outlet temperature due to higher   ̇V  values
 ̇
was  offset  by  the  improved  efficiency  associated  with  increased
V.
Specifically, it was observed that the enhancement in zero-loss ηPC when
 ̇
V changed from 54 to 72 l/h (∼ 7.7 %) was more substantial than when
it changed from 72 lit/h to 90 l/h (∼ 5 %). Authors stated a correlation

V (from 54 to

obtained by Gorji and Ranjbar [63]. Authors argued that, at the higher
outlet temperature the DASC achieves at a low   ̇V  (Fig. 41a), losses to
surroundings increase, due to a higher temperature difference with the
ambient, causing the ηPC  to decrease (Fig. 41b). On the other hand, the

presented the same argument. Also, they experimentally observed that
the  transition  from  laminar  to  turbulent  flow  regimes  enhanced  the
collector’s  ηPC,  as  turbulent  flow  exhibited  reduced  solar  absorption
compared  to  laminar  flow.  Consequently,  laminar  flow  led  to  greater
temperature increases, resulting in elevated heat losses. This theme is
accounted for in the literature by investigating the Re variation impacts
on DASC performance that will be a discussion in a coming subsection.

6.2. Operating temperature

Apart  from  the  fact  that  increasing  the  nanofluid  temperature  in-
creases the convective and radiative heat losses to surroundings and thus
deteriorates  the  DASC’s  ηPC,  as  shown  in  Fig.  28a  [273],  this  section
discusses the impact of temperature on the nanofluid OTPs. In the study

by Maheshwary et al. [321], discussed earlier, it was evident that the
thermal conductivity of the TiO2/water nanofluid tends to increase with
temperature, as Fig. 27a shows. This behavior is explained by the fact
that material molecules become more energized when temperature in-
creases, and thus, heat transfer is enhanced. However, such a growth in
thermal  conductivity  with  temperature  cannot  be  attributed  to  the
growth in thermal conductivity of the carrier fluid [362]. However, it is
justified  by  the  increased  Brownian  motion  which,  in  turn, augments
energy transport within the nanofluid [363]. Particularly at elevated fV,
Godson  et  al.  [364]  contended  that  the  speed  of  particle  Brownian
motion  and  the  influence  of  thermophoresis  on  nanoparticles  height-
ened. Thermophoresis represents particle motion driven by temperature
gradients in the fluid. In certain instances, thermophoresis may exert a
more  significant  impact  than  Brownian  motion,  yet  both  factors
collectively amplify particle collisions. Predominantly, these collisions
among nanoparticles lead to an elevation in the thermal conductivity.
Additionally,  Brownian  motion  induces  stirring  of  water  molecules,
giving rise to microconvection within the liquid, thereby enhancing heat
transfer. In Fig. 27b, Maheshwary et al. [321] indicated the reduction of
the viscosity with temperature, which promises to decrease the pumping
power.  Similar  results  were  presented  in  Refs.  [67,365,366].  Lower
viscosity  allows  nanoparticles  to  move  more  easily  through  the  base
fluid, enhancing their mobility and reducing resistance to heat transfer,
which can contribute to an increase in the thermal conductivity.

Higher thermal conductivity and lower viscosity with temperature
are  reasons  for  higher  DASC  thermal  performance  [280],  but  it  is
well-known that increasing the nanofluid temperature means a greater
difference with the ambient and thus greater losses. Also, Wang et al.
[345] observed that elevated temperatures diminished the irradiation
absorption capacity of thermal oil L-QB320, which is the base fluid in

their  study,  and  Otanicar  et  al.  [109],  in  the  study  discussed  earlier,
stated that the temperature increase causes the transmittance of nano-
fluids to increase. However, the utilization of plasmonic nanoparticles
introduces  the  LSPR  effect,  which  primarily  governs  the  absorption
ability  of  these  particles.  This  effect  is  influenced  by  factors  such  as
particle size, morphology, and metal composition. Temperature plays a
significant  role  in  altering  the  optical  absorption  properties  of  nano-
particles,  impacting  their  dielectric  function,  refractive  index  of  the
surrounding medium, and particle size. Specifically, as temperature in-
creases, the nanoparticles expand in volume while the plasma frequency
decreases.  Conversely,  lower  temperatures  weaken  the  LSPR  effect,
leading to a decreased absorption rate.

ηPC  of  nanofluid-based  DASCs  and  a  commercial  Rheem  RS24-BP
collector  are  compared  in  Fig.  42  revealing  two  important  points.
First,  most  nanofluid-based  DASCs  have  lower  performance  than  a
conventional FPC, especially at higher temperatures. This indicates the
need  for  more  research  on  developing  full-scale  collectors  that  can
reduce the heat loss mechanisms. Second, some nanofluid-based DASCs
have  higher  performance  at  very  low  temperatures  (marked  in  the
figure), which is due to the strong absorption capacity of nanoparticles
[18].

6.3. Non-dimensional numbers

This section is devoted to discussing the effects of non-dimensional
numbers,  including  Re,  Nu,  and  Pe  on  the  performance  of  DASC  sys-
tems. A literature survey revealed that Re is a major operating parameter
with which the DASC performance criteria remarkably change. Parvin
et al. [204] examined the performance of DASC employing a water/Cu
nanofluid using the single phase model under a range of Re extended
from 200 to 1000. Results showed that the heat transfer rate enhanced
by 31 % and ηPC has doubled when Re varied from 200 to 1000 at fV  of 3
%.  As  Re  rises,  inertial  forces  become  predominant,  leading  to  an
enhancement  in  convective  heat  transfer.  Chronologically,  Das  et  al.
[209]  numerically  investigated  a  DASC  employing  an  aqueous  TiO2
nanofluid using both a single phase model and a mixture model. They
reported  that,  as  Re  increases  over  the  range  (100–2000),  the  Nu,
average  heat  transfer  coefficient,  and  pressure  drop  significantly  in-
crease. Moreover, the multiphase model exhibited a higher endorsement
with  experimental  results  while  the  single-phase  model  remarkably
underestimated the Nu at certain Re values. Furthermore, Jyani et al.
[369] concluded that at considerably high Re, the DASC performance
grows when the flow regime transits from laminar to turbulent.

In a more thorough investigation, Sharaf et al. [85] used the novel
coupled  Eulerian-Lagrangian  approach  to  reveal  the  effect  of  the
discrete nature of nanoparticles on the thermal and optical features of

Fig.  42. The  effect  of  operating  temperature  on  ηPC  for  different  nanofluids

the reference list, respectively). (Reused with permission from Elsevier).

DASCs. The authors observed that the increased Re leads to an uneven
nanoparticle  spatial  distribution  within  the  nanofluid,  which  means
non-uniform light extinction due to the spatial variations in the nano-
fluid  optical  characteristics.  Plus,  the  authors  affirmed  the  increasing
DASC ηPC  behavior with Re as found by past studies, they described the
detailed behavior  of the  DASC performance criteria with deep  justifi-
cations by virtue of capturing the discrete nature of nanoparticles. Au-
thors  reported  that  Re  significantly  influences  the  nanoparticle
distribution  in  nanofluid  flow  within  DASCs,  with  substantial  conse-
quences  for  both  optical  and  thermal  properties,  as  well  as  collector
performance. Understanding the effect of spatial nanoparticle distribu-
tion and local concentration could help present the full picture of the
temperature  and  radiative  heat  flux  distributions  within  the  DASC.
Fig. 43a illustrates that, at low Re, there is a uniform nanoparticle dis-
tribution within the collector. However, as Re increases (Fig. 43b and c),
there is a notable reduction in concentration near the collector walls due
to increased nanoparticle transverse migration away from the upper and
lower surfaces. This migration phenomenon in particulate flows within
channels arises from the tendency of suspended particles to move from
regions with high shear rates to those with low shear rates, resulting in a
low-particle-concentration  zone  adjacent  to  the  walls.  At  low  Re,  the
impact of shear-induced migration is counteracted by Brownian diffu-
sion,  leading  to  nanoparticle  homogenization  within  the  collector.
Conversely,  in  high  convection-dominated  flows  (i.e.,  high  Re),  the
weaker influence of Brownian diffusion in comparison to flow inertia
intensifies particle migration, as depicted in Fig. 43c.

e , it does impact the uniformity of nanoparticle distribution, as

Eulerian-Lagrangian modeling reveals that the nanofluid’s flow Re
significantly influences its optical properties. Fig. 44 displays the spec-
tral  Knf
e  of  graphite  nanofluid  near  the  collector’s  upper  surface  for
varying Re values. While Re itself does  not have  a direct relationship
with Knf
previously established. Consequently, the local Knf
e , determined by local
nanoparticle concentration, is affected by Re. Specifically, as depicted in
Fig. 44, increasing Re leads to a reduction in the nanofluid’s solar ra-
diation  extinction  capability  near  the  collector’s  upper  surface  –  a
crucial area in DASCs, as it directly affects thermal losses to surround-
ings. This decline is attributed to the decrease in nanoparticle concen-
tration near the upper and lower walls with increasing Re, as illustrated
in Fig. 43.

As  for  the  effect  of  the  heat  loss  Nu,  Veeraragavan  et  al.  [136]
basically stated that the DASC with a higher heat loss Nu has greater heat
losses  and  thus  lower ηPC.  Furthermore,  Lee  and  Jang  [210],  in  their
work discussed earlier, reported the effect of the heat loss Nu on ηPC and
temperature distribution within a DASC. They changed the value of the
convective heat loss coefficient from 6.43 (the value used by Tyagi et al.
[57])  to  250  W/m2K  (the  maximum  forced  convection  heat  transfer
coefficient for gases), which is corresponding to Nu range from 0.106 to
4.12. Results showed that as Nu increases, the temperature within the
DASC decreases. At the lowest Nu (=0.106), temperature rises uniformly
along  the  collector  length  with  a  small  temperature  gradient  in  the
y-direction, resulting in a negligible thermal trapping effect, akin to the
"greenhouse effect". Conversely, at the top surface with high heat loss
(Nu = 4.12), temperature increases slowly along the collector length due
to significant heat loss, leading to a pronounced thermal trapping phe-
nomenon where the top surface temperature is lower than the bottom
surface. Fig. 15 illustrates an inverse relationship between the DASC’s
ηPC  and heat loss Nu. Also, it demonstrates that the predicted ηPC  based
on  the  plug-flow  assumption  exceeds  that  with  fully-developed  flow.
This  suggests  that  ηPC  is  more  sensitive  to  heat  loss  magnitude  with
fully-developed flow. Furthermore, the plug flow exhibits greater ther-
mal energy transport along the flow direction due to higher momentum
near the top surface compared to fully developed flow. Consequently,
the prediction model using plug flow may overestimate ηPC compared to
the  model  with  fully-developed  flow,  which  aligns  more  closely  with
actual conditions.

As the Peclet number (Pe) puts convective and heat transport phe-
nomena in correlation (i.e., Pe = (convection/thermal diffusion) = Re
Pr), it can be seen that it is not a material property since it involves Re
that depends on the flow velocity and geometry characteristic length. Pe
serves,  in  DASC  analytical  studies  discussed  earlier,  as  a  scaling
parameter for the axial coordinates [136]. The increase of Pe indicates
that  the  collector  length  needed  to  achieve  a  certain  temperature  in-
crease. Furthermore, high Pe implies that the nanofluid flows rapidly in
the collector and thus can deliver greater amounts of heat, but this fast
movement shortens the residence time in the collector. These two con-
sequences lead to increase in the DASC’s ηPC  and decrease in its tem-
perature, as obtained by Lee et al. [215]. Similar conclusions were stated
in a study by Lee and Jang [210]. However, these authors reported that
the Pe impacts on ηPC can be observed only at high heat losses, otherwise
they are negligible. Moreover, at high heat loss, the ηPC  curve exhibits
modest gradients that could reach zero at high Pe, as shown in Fig. 45. As
an  explanation,  the  DASC’s  ηPC  is  defined  as  the  ratio  of  useful  heat
 ̇
Qu =  ̇mcpΔT) to radiative power received. As Pe increases,   ̇m
gained (
increases, but the temperature gain (ΔT) decreases. Thus, variations of
ηPC  with  Pe  are  barely  noticed.  Moreover,  Fig.  45  shows  that  the

plug-flow assumption, again, overestimates the DASC’s ηPC compared to
the fully developed one since the plug flow generates higher momentum
in the boundary layer near the wall, which leads to overestimations of
the useful energy carried by the working fluid.

7. Economic and environmental analyses of nanofluid-based
DASC systems

Nanofluid-based  DASCs  have  gained  significant  attention  as  a
promising technology for harnessing solar energy as they offer several
advantages,  including  higher  efficiency,  reduced  heat  losses,  and
simplified design. However, before widespread adoption, it is crucial to
evaluate their economic viability and environmental impact.

The  literature  offers  definitions  to  assess  the  economic  and  envi-
ronmental impacts of products or systems such as the nanofluid-based
DASC,  including  the  life  cycle  assessment  (LCA)  and  offset  damage
cost. LCA is a systematic methodology for assessing the environmental
impacts associated with all stages of a commercial product. It serves as a
holistic baseline for comparing carbon footprints and guides sustainable
decision-making by assessing environmental impacts across a product’s
entire life cycle. The offset damage cost refers to the reduction in envi-
ronmental  or  economic  harm  achieved  by  implementing  a  particular
technology. In the context of nanofluid-based DASCs, it represents the
positive  impact  of  using  these  collectors  compared  to  conventional

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience103(2024)10116051

A. Hasan et al.

alternatives, such as the reduced emissions, embodied energy savings,
faster payback period (i.e., how long it takes to recover the cost of the
system),  and  quantifying  the  offset.  For  instance,  Faizal  et  al.  [370]
showed  that  SiO2  nanofluid-based  collectors  can  save  280  MJ  more
embodied energy, offset 170 kg less CO2 emissions, and achieve a faster
payback period compared to conventional water-based solar collectors

7.1. Economic assessment

Nanofluids, with their superior thermal conductivity, have enabled
the development of smaller and more compact solar collectors that still
deliver the same desired output as that delivered by a larger conven-
tional collector with a conventional working fluid. Faizal et al. [371]
stated that the use of Al2O3/water nanofluid instead of pure water in a
flat-plate solar collector can achieve the same output temperature but
with a collector size that is up to 24 % smaller. The reduction in the
system size means lower embodied energy, which is energy needed to
produce  a  material,  and  lower  overall  material  cost.  In  the  existing
literature, emphasis is placed on the consideration of embodied energy
when employing nanofluids in solar collectors, as opposed to conven-
tional pure fluids. The focus remains on the energy expended during the
manufacturing phase of the solar collector itself, while other life cycle
stages (such as distribution, maintenance, and disposal) are intention-
ally neglected. Notably, Ardente et al. [372] assert that over 70 % of the
total embodied energy within the system originates specifically from the
collector  manufacturing  process.  To  quantify  this,  researchers  often
adopt the reduction of collector area as the functional unit, significantly
influencing the overall weight and embodied energy. Faizal et al. [373]
stated that the predominant materials, for solar collectors, include glass
and copper. They reported that, in a typical 40 kg collector, the weight
ratio  stands  at  approximately  30  kg  of  glass  and  10  kg  of  copper.
Importantly,  the  embodied  energy  index  varies  significantly:  15.9
MJ/kg for glass and a notably higher 70.6 MJ/kg for copper [34]. By
incorporating the results of size reduction, researchers can accurately
calculate the weight and embodied energy for the solar collector. The
potential  cost  savings  resulting  from  the  smaller  collector  size  could
offset  the  increased  price  of  the  utilized  nanofluid  and  thus  balance
overall cost of the nanofluid-based solar thermal system. These consid-
erations are pivotal for evaluating the sustainability and efficiency of
nanofluid-based solar technologies.

The economic evaluation of nanofluids in solar energy systems, as
reported in the literature [64,374], depends on several factors, including
local  energy  costs,  government  subsidies,  and  system-specific  consid-
erations. These considerations include the electrical usage of mechanical
circulation pumps, nanofluid costs, annual maintenance expenses (set at
2 % of the initial cost), and an expected annual interest rate for cumu-
lative savings (also at 2 %). Additionally, the systems are assumed to
generate continuous electricity, remaining connected to the grid.

Solar  collector  capital  costs  typically  consist  of  two  components:
area-dependent  costs  (CA)  and  area-independent  costs  (Cf ).  The  total
cost (Ct), when considering the maintenance cost (Cm) which is taken as
2 % of the capital cost with a 1 % increase yearly for the system lifetime,
is expressed as [34]:

Cs = CAA + Cf + Cm

(113)

To calculate the cost savings resulting from solar collector operation,

the daily energy flow is considered alongside local electricity rates.

Faizal  et  al.  [373]  performed  an  economic  and  embodied  energy
analyses  for  a  nanofluid-based  solar  thermal  system  (solar  heater  in
Malaysia) utilizing different aqueous nanofluids and compared the re-
sults with a conventional system utilizing pure water as a working fluid.
Research findings indicated that reducing the copper and glass content
in  the  nanofluid-based  solar  collector  led  to  an  average  reduction  of
approximately 220 MJ in the embodied energy of the nanofluid-based
collector compared to the conventional water-based collector. Similar

conclusions were drawn by Otanicar et al. [34] in the context of graphite
nanofluids  for  DASCs.  Additionally,  Faizal  et  al.  [373]  showed  that,
compared to conventional collectors, nanofluid-based collectors exhibit
a  shorter  payback  period  primarily  due  to  their  reduced  capital  cost.
Among  nanofluids,  SiO2  and  CuO-based  collectors  have  the  shortest
payback  periods.  Despite  the  higher  cost  of  CuO  nanoparticles,  the
increased efficiency and reduced collector area (calculated based on Eq.
(1)) of CuO-based nanofluid collectors nearly equalize their overall cost
with SiO2 nanofluid collectors. On the other hand, Otanicar and Golden
[375] stated that the conventional collector may have a shorter payback
period compared to the nanofluid-based collector, mainly because of the
higher initial capital cost associated with certain types of nanoparticles
required  for  the  nanofluid-based  system.  Additionally,  further  cost
savings can be achieved if nanoparticle prices decrease as they become
more widely adopted and produced.

7.2. Environmental impact

One  significant  motivation  for  transitioning  to  solar  energy  har-
vesting  systems,  particularly  for  residential  applications  like  water
heating, is the reduction in emissions stemming from fossil fuel burning.
By conducting a thorough analysis of thermal performance, the emis-
sions offset facilitated by solar collectors can be qualitatively assessed.
Otanicar and Golden [375] presented an environmental assessment of a
nanofluid-based  solar  collector  used  to  heat  water.  The  assessment  is
based on the energy difference between the energy needed to meet the
daily  hot  water  load  (Qload)  and  the  auxiliary  energy  supplied  by  a
conventional electric or natural gas water heater (Qaux), considering the
emissions  profile  associated  with  electricity  generation  in  Phoenix,
Arizona.  The  authors  stated  a  formula  to  determine  the  amount  of
emissions offset by the use of a solar collector (EMP,offset), expressed as
follows [375]:

EMP,offset =

∑N

j=1

Aj,PBj,P(Qload (cid:0) Qaux)

(114)

where Aj,P  is the amount of the pollutant (P) generated from the fuel (j)
given in kg per MJ of the produced energy, and Bj,P  is the percentage of
energy produced by a certain fuel type. Qaux  is given as follows:

Qaux = Qload (cid:0) (Qu (cid:0) Qloss)

(115)

where Qu is the useful energy obtained from the collector, and Qloss is the
energy  lost  to  the  surroundings.  The  environmental  analysis  demon-
strated that manufacturing the nanofluid-based DASC system results in
34 kg less CO2 emissions compared to the conventional solar collector.
Additionally,  during  operational  use,  it  saves  50  kg  of  CO2  per  year.
However,  the  differences  in  remaining  emissions  (SOx  and  NOx)  are
relatively  small.  Also,  results  showed  that,  over  the  15-year  expected
lifetime of both solar collectors, the nanofluid-based system would offset
more than 740 kg of CO2 compared to a conventional solar collector and
23,000 kg of CO2 when compared to traditional electric water heaters.
Furthermore, research indicated that if 50 % of the residents in Phoenix,
Arizona, adopt nanofluid-based solar  collectors, an impressive annual
reduction of 1,000,000 metric tons of CO2  could be achieved. Finally,
the total damage cost avoided per year was $88 and $91 for the con-
ventional collector and nanofluid-based DASC, respectively.

According  to  Tiwari  et  al.  [376],  the  utilization  of  Al2O3-based
nanofluid in flat-plate solar heaters significantly reduces CO2 emissions
(in kg CO2 per kWh) by 32 % compared to conventional flat plate solar
heaters. Additionally, a study by Khullar and Tyagi [377] revealed that
adopting nanofluid-based concentrated heaters could lead to substantial
energy  savings.  Specifically,  these  heaters  would  save  1716  kWh  per
household  annually,  which  would  otherwise  come  from  fossil  fuels
(liquefied  petroleum  gas).  Consequently,  this  energy-saving  measure
results in a reduction of 2200 kg of CO2 emissions each year. Kim et al.

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience103(2024)10116052

A. Hasan et al.

[378] investigated various nanofluids (including Al2O3, MWCNTs, SiO2,
and CuO) in a U-tube solar collector. Compared to conventional solar
heaters, the use of MWCNT nanofluid, that escalated the photothermal
efficiency of the collector up to 63 % with fV  of 0.2 %, in the system
would lead to annual reductions of 6.900 kg of CO2 and 0.022 kg of SO2
emissions. Considering the usage of 50 solar heaters in Gwangju, South
Korea, the adoption of nanofluid-based solar heaters would also result in
a substantial reduction in annual coal usage by 792 kg, equivalent to a
decrease of 2080 kg in CO2 production and a reduction of 6.7 kg in SO2
emissions.

On the other hand, in spite of the positive side of nanofluidic systems
in  terms  of  the  harmful  emissions  reduction,  critical  environmental
concerns could be associated with nanofluids, necessitating a thorough
discussion. These concerns arise from the use of nanoparticles in nano-
fluid synthesis, stemming from both the synthetic procedures involved
and the physicochemical properties of nanomaterials [379]. While the
composition  of  nanofluids  is  relevant,  it  is  the  unique  features  of
nanomaterials,  such as  their surface  area and  size, that raise primary
environmental  alarms.  Due  to  their  substantial  surface  energy,  nano-
materials  exhibit  high  reactivity  and  can  readily  penetrate  human
bodies, potentially causing harm to vital organs [380]. The size of these
nanoparticles is a critical factor; particles typically smaller than 100 nm
can be inhaled, posing a serious risk to lung health. Furthermore, the
release of nanoparticles into the atmosphere during nanofluid prepara-
tion or usage can lead to severe health issues upon inhalation by humans
or  other  mammals.  Once  inhaled,  these  nanoparticles  can  enter  the
bloodstream, resulting in toxicity to various organs, including the lungs,
skin,  liver,  and  brain  [381,382].  Their  impact  extends  to  cellular
structures,  affecting  DNA,  mitochondria,  and  cell  membranes,  ulti-
mately  inducing  oxidative  stress  [383,384].  Therefore,  implementing
proper safety protocols is essential [379].

More concretely, all carbon nanoparticles are toxic, but their toxicity
level depends on their dimensions and surface chemistry [164]. Also, Au
nanoparticle  size  and  even  shape  are  good  indicators  of  its  level  of
toxicity.  When  Au  nanoparticles  are  15  nm  or  larger,  they  behave
essentially  non-toxically,  but  when  they  are  1–2  nm  smaller,  they
become highly toxic [385]. Furthermore, spherical Au nanoparticles are
less hazardous than rod-shaped ones [386]. Depending on the toxicity of
nanoparticles, they can cause minor to severe harmful implications on
the  ecosystem,  as  discussed  earlier.  As  a  result,  one  of  the  biggest
challenges may be the increased use of nanoparticles in various appli-
cations  and  potential  human  interaction  with  them.  However,  no
benchmarking on the toxicity of the various nanoparticles utilized for
various applications, the procedures needed, or requirements for their
disposal has been documented as of yet [64].

When nanofluids are released into water streams like rivers and seas,
their impact on aquatic life becomes a concern. These nanoparticles can
accumulate in organisms such as fish and shrimp, potentially affecting
both aquatic ecosystems and human consumers [387,388]. Researchers,
instead,  have  proposed  innovative  methods  to  mitigate  the  potential
harmful  effects  of  nanofluids.  For  instance,  Akhavan-Behabadi  et  al.
[389]  advocate  for  recycling  carbon  nanotubes  (CNTs)  used  in  nano-
fluids to prevent inhalation-related health risks. Similarly, Ranjbarzadeh
et al. [390] highlight the use of eco-friendly nano-silica derived from
rice  husks—a  renewable  agricultural  waste.  This  sustainable  nano-
material  enhances  heat  transfer  by  up  to  33  %  (at  55
C  with  a  3  %
volume  fraction).  Careful  nanoparticle  selection,  such  as  opting  for
CuO-based nanofluids over pure Cu that persists in the environment and
makes it challenging to eliminate [391], contributes to effective recy-
cling and minimizes environmental impact.

8. Concluding remarks, challenges, research gaps, and future
directions

Nanofluid-based direct absorption solar collectors (DASC) represent
an innovative and promising technology in the solar energy harvesting

field. By employing colloidal suspensions, DASCs are characterized by
enhanced solar absorption ability and improved photothermal conver-
sion efficiency. However, despite significant progress, there are several
challenges,  unexplored  areas,  and  research  gaps  that  need  to  be
addressed to harness the full potential of this technology. This section
discusses  the  conclusions  withdrawn  from  the  literature  reviewed
above, key challenges, and future directions in the field of nanofluid-
based DASCs.

Concluding remarks and challenges:

-  Solar nanofluids are used in DASC systems as they can enhance their
optical performance by orders of magnitude with very tiny volume
fractions  (fV < 0.001)  and  ultrafine  nanoparticles  (Dp < 40  nm).
Dependent  scattering  effects  in  calculations  of  nanofluid’s  optical
properties  are  usually  negligible  in  the  literature  for  (fV < 0.006).
Nevertheless,  other  studies  proved  that  adopting  fV < 0.06  as  a
threshold permits the neglect of dependent scattering effects in solar
nanofluids (for sufficiently small particles Dp < 40 nm) with an error
of no more than 5 %.

-  The  Rayleigh  approach  is  a  weak  tool  to  predict  the  radiative
behavior of a nanofluid, especially, in the UV, where the strong light
extinction  is  due  to  light  scattering,  which  is  neglected  in  this
approach. In a bit more detail, it results in accurate extinction co-
efficient  predictions  for  carbon-based  nanofluids,  overestimations
for metal-based nanofluids in the relatively short-wavelength bands
(< 700  nm),  and  underestimations  for  metal-based  nanofluids  in
longer wavelength regions. Researchers attributed the failure of the
Rayleigh approach with metal-based nanoparticles to agglomeration
(which enlarges the particle size over the manufacturer-rated size)
and surface oxidation (which changes the particle optical constants)
phenomena.  Moreover,  the  independent  scattering  assumption,
stated for Rayleigh approximation to be valid, is justified within the
limit conditions mentioned in the previous point, however, this was
not the case in all the studies that used the Rayleigh approach. This
justifies  the  contradictions found in  the  literature regarding  nano-
fluids’ radiative behaviors with nanoparticle size variations.

-  Many studies in the field of DASCs simplify radiative heat transfer.
For example, they assume that solar irradiance varies only along the
y-axis, neglecting radiation scattering and emission by the working
fluid. Consequently, the impact of radiation is simplified to a heat
source  dependent  solely  on  y-coordinates.  Radiative  heat  loss  is
addressed using an effective coefficient, alongside convective heat
loss. This simplification is based on the approximation that radiative
losses in low-flux DASCs can be neglected as severe radiative heat
losses,  that  cannot  be  neglected,  occur  when  DASC  temperatures
exceed 750 K. However, solving the full radiative transport equation
and accounting for radiative losses in high-temperature DASCs may
yield significantly different results compared to the simplified RTE.
For instance, considering radiative losses from a DASC operating at
◦
500
C (close to the literature-stated limit of 750 K) and solving the
full RTE revealed that the conventional model overestimated outlet
C and ηPC  by 18.9 % [135], which are signifi-
temperature by 27.6
cant disparities. Therefore, the literature-stated limit of 750 K should
be taken with caution when calculating for reliable solar systems.
-  Several  assumptions,  commonly  stated  by  researchers  in  DASC
modeling, result in inaccurate performance predictions. For instance,
the plug flow assumption leads to overestimations of DASC’s pho-
tothermal conversion efficiency, particularly in case of high heat loss
coefficient and Reynolds number. Such an assumption is not valid for
DASCs because it specifies a creeping flow which is not the real case
in DASCs. Also, this assumption overestimates the flow momentum
near  the  collector  walls,  and  thus  leads  to  overprediction  of  the
collector performance. The fully-developed flow assumption is more
realistic in DASCs modeling although it neglects the entrance region
impacts  on  the collector  performance.  Moreover,  several pieces  of
research  ignore  the  atmospheric  attenuation  impacts  on  the

◦

A. Hasan et al.

extraterrestrial solar spectrum by the assumption of blackbody pro-
file  for  incident  radiation  heat  flux,  which  results  in  inaccurate
performance  description  since  the  nanofluids’  scattering  and  ab-
sorption efficiencies are a function of solar radiation wavelength.
-  The fully-continuous single-phase modeling approach based on the
homogeneous nanoparticle distribution assumption, prevalent in the
literature,  is  no  longer  valid  beyond  a  critical  Reynolds  number
(Re ≈ 1)  [85].  Thus,  the  need  for  capturing  the  discrete  nature  of
nanoparticles  and  considering  the  spatially  uneven  attenuation  of
solar radiation due to the spatially non-uniform nanoparticle distri-
bution within the DASC becomes necessary for accurate performance
criteria predictions. Such an assumption was found to overestimate
the  DASC’s  photothermal  conversion  efficiency,  which  affects  the
reliability  of  the  system  if  it  is  manufactured  for  commercial  pur-
poses. Instead, many studies stressed that DASCs performance pre-
dictions  obtained  based  on  a  multi-phase  model  are  far  more
accurate and significantly closer to experimental results compared to
those obtained based on a single-phase model.

-  When  comparing  theoretical  model  predictions  with  experimental
data for validation purposes, it is imperative to account for experi-
mental  uncertainties  arising  from  various  factors  including  nano-
particle  aggregation  and  sedimentation  phenomena,  and  potential
measurement errors.

-  The  solar  nanofluid’s  prolonged  exposure  to  intense  solar  flux  or
elevated temperatures leads to its destabilization, which weakens its
ability  to  extinct  solar  radiation  and  thus  diminishes  the  photo-
thermal efficiency of the solar system. Stability is one of the most
important features that should characterize a nanofluid. Research,
therefore,  suggested  many  protective  and  responsive  methods  to
enhance the nanofluid stability. However, as exposure to solar ra-
diation  is  a  genuine  reason  for  solar  nanofluid  instability,  it  is
important  to  use  a  stability  technique  that  does  not  mask  nano-
particles and deteriorate their absorption ability.

-  The  notion  of  a  high  zeta  potential  guaranteeing  exceptional
colloidal stability is challenged by several studies. Sterically stabi-
lized  dispersions,  for  instance,  can  exhibit  low  zeta  potential  yet
remain entirely stable [77]. Conversely, electrostatically stabilized
dispersions experience fluctuations in electrical double layer thick-
ness  due  to  changes  in  ionic  strength  (e.g.,  contamination,  oxida-
tion).  This,  in  turn,  alters  the  zeta  potential  needed  for  optimal
stability. Consequently, zeta potential should be interpreted solely as
an  indicator  of  electrostatic  repulsion  forces  between  colloidal
nanoparticles.

- In contrast to nanofluid thermal properties, which typically neces-
sitate  relatively  high  nanoparticle  loadings  for  heat  transfer  prop-
erties  to  be  notably  enhanced,  optical  properties  relevant  to
photothermal conversion systems, like DASCs, can exhibit significant
improvement  with  nanoparticle  dispersion  at  orders  of  magnitude
lower volume fractions (< 0.001). Research has shown that higher
nanoparticle loadings yield near-surface absorption dominating over
volumetric absorption since a greater portion of radiation extinction
occurs within the uppermost nanofluid layers rather than the bulk
nanofluid  volume,  which  can  deteriorate  the  performance  of
nanofluid-based DASCs. Furthermore, studies on DASC proved that
there  exists  an  optimum  volume  fraction  beyond  which  the  solar
radiation absorption ability of the nanofluid no longer increases. This
value changes with the nanofluid type (e.g., optimum fV  of 0.0001
for MWCNT/water nanoparticle [14]). In general, different studies
stated  that  the  performance  of  a  nanofluid  starts  to  deteriorate
beyond fV  of 1 wt% [76].

-  Due to the trace nanoparticle loading required for high-performance
in nanofluid-based DASC systems (fV < 0.001), the pumping power
needed to circulate the nanofluid does significantly increase. This is a
consequence of the negligible increase in viscosity and pressure drop
associated with such dilute nanofluids.

-  The response of DASC performance to the base fluid type changes
with other factors such as the fV and bottom surface emissivity. While
a  particular  base  fluid  might  excel  at  specific  fV  and  emissivity
combinations, others may perform better under different conditions.
Interestingly, it was observed that the base fluid type and fV  insig-
nificantly affect the DASC photothermal conversion efficiency when
the bottom surface emissivity is high. Moreover, DASCs employing
water-based nanofluids always show superior performance when fV
is high (≥ 0.0005), no matter what the bottom surface emissivity is
(i.e., the sensitivity of the DASC performance to the bottom surface
emissivity is negligible when fV  is high). Such contradictions can be
resolved based on the mentioned-earlier fact that, at high fV, most
light is absorbed at the nanofluid top layers. Thus, the role of the
bottom wall is considered irrelevant and the DASC behavior becomes
similar to a surface absorber.

-  Although water was classified as a strong light-absorber base fluid
among other heat transfer fluids [298], EG and engine oil were found
to  have  superior  thermophysical  and  heat  transfer  characteristics
compared to water. However, blending EG with water enhances the
thermal  characteristics  of  water  to  become  as  appropriate  as  its
radiative properties.

-  Carbon-based,  transition  metal  nitride,  and  2D  MXene  composite
plasmonic  nanofluids  are  super  functional  for  nanofluid-enhanced
thermal performance of DASCs with distinguished optical and ther-
mal  performance,  and  thus  great  ηPC  even  at  very  low  volume
fractions.

- Nanofluids  composed  of  angular  (sharp-edged)  or  cubic  nano-
particles manifest enhanced properties pertaining to light absorption
and thermal conductivity when compared with spherical or rod-like
nanoparticles. Platelet-shaped or cylindrical particles, in particular,
yield superior performance in terms of entropy, viscosity generation,
and  thermal  conductivity.  Commonly,  nanoparticles  characterized
by  anisotropic  characteristics  and  possessing  multiple  surfaces
exhibit heightened capabilities in terms of radiation absorption and
thermal  properties.  However,  no  consistent  conclusion  could  be
drawn as of yet regarding the influence of nanoparticle shape on the
hydrothermal performance of thermal systems. Also, the influence of
nanoparticle shape on the nanofluid performance in the majority of
research  is  theoretically  implemented  through  thermophysical
properties, with relatively little experimental evidence to support it.
Future  experimental  efforts  for  diverse  nanoparticle  shapes  in
various nanofluids with single and hybrid nanoparticles are therefore
necessary.

-  Since  light  scattering  effects  are  less  and  thermal  properties  are
better  when  using  smaller-sized  nanoparticles,  nanoparticle  size
should be reduced for a higher-optical performance solar nanofluid
and higher enhancement rate in heat transfer.

-  Increasing  the  collector  length  results  in  adverse  impacts  on  the
DASC’s  photothermal  conversion  efficiency,  as  found  by  many
studies, due to increasing the exposure time to radiation which yields
elevated temperatures and greater losses. Optimization studies sug-
gested that a sensible flow velocity selection should be compatible
with the collector length for the DASC to harness the greatest amount
of useful energy.

-  Contradictions, including a rise, drop, or rise-followed-by-drop, are
observed in the literature regarding the behavior of DASC’s photo-
thermal conversion efficiency with variations of collector length. By
taking into consideration other interlinked parameters, such as the
volume fraction, heat loss coefficient, and type of bottom  surface,
such  contradictions  can  be  resolved  as  follows:  At  high  fV,  the
increased  collector  length  consistently  reduces  photothermal  con-
version efficiency due to heightened temperatures in the top nano-
fluid layers, exposed to surroundings, where most light-absorption
occurs.  Conversely,  at  low  fV,  greater  radiation  absorption  occurs
within the nanofluid bulk and at the collector bottom surface (in case
of absorptive bottom), promoting thermal trapping and leading to a

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience103(2024)10116054

A. Hasan et al.

rise in photothermal conversion efficiency with increasing collector
length. For moderate fV, the impact of collector length on efficiency
exhibits a rise followed by a drop, resulting from the combined ef-
fects of elevated top layer temperatures and thermal trapping.

-  DASCs  with  thicker  nanofluid  films  consistently  exhibit  higher
thermal efficiencies, regardless of the fV  value, because when DASC
height increases, greater sunlight attenuation occurs as light crosses
the nanofluid film and translates into absorption, temperature, and
photothermal conversion efficiency increases. However, the surface
type  of  the  bottom  wall  plays  a  main  role  in  revealing  the  exact
behavior. Thinner DASCs with a fully absorptive bottom suffer from
higher thermal losses, compared to thicker DASCs, due to higher top-
layer  temperatures.  Thinner  DASCs  with  fully  reflective  or  trans-
parent bottoms and a low-to-moderate fV suffer from higher radiative
losses, compared to thicker DASCs, due to the short light travel dis-
tance through the nanofluid and thus weak absorption. However, at
higher fV, the nanofluid allows more efficient heat transfer from hot
top to cold bottom layers.

-  Different  novel  innovative  DASC  designs  offered  in  the  literature
confirm  that  there  is  room  for  dramatic  development  in  DASC
technology by proposing new designs with heightened performance
and mitigated losses and pipeline blockages, and that can be valid for
different engineering systems. Modifications, including the position
of  incident  radiation,  shape  and  surface  type  of  the  bottom  wall,
employing  auxiliaries  such  as  porous  media,  or  magnetic  fields,
implementing an annular pipe, as explained earlier, using thermal
insulation  layers  [145],  etc.,  can  lead  to  remarkably  higher
performance.

- Low nanofluid flow rates result in a low DASC’s photothermal con-
version efficiency due to the longer residence (i.e., exposure to ra-
diation) time inside DASCs which yields high temperatures and thus
high  radiative  and  convective  losses.  In  contrast,  high  flow  rates
result in a higher efficiency. Understanding these effects is crucial for
optimizing DASC design making a trade-off between efficiency and
temperature.

-  Investigations into the effect of nanofluid thermal conductivity on
DASC performance yielded several key findings. First, at low nano-
particle volume fractions, enhancing nanofluid thermal conductivity
had a small negative effect due to the dominance of volumetric ab-
sorption of solar radiation. Conversely, at high nanoparticle volume
fractions,  improved  thermal  conductivity  had  a  positive  impact,
playing  a  crucial  role  in  propagating  absorbed  energy  within  the
nanofluid  volume,  where  surface  absorption  dominated.  Notably,
changes in nanofluid thermal conductivity had minimal impact on
energy efficiency when using base fluids with inherently high ther-
mal conductivities (e.g., water). However, DASCs employing nano-
fluids  composed  of  base  fluids  with  relatively  low  thermal
conductivities  (e.g.,  therminol  VP-1)  were  more  sensitive  to  such
variations.

-  Although Re does not have a direct relation with nanofluid extinction
coefficient, increasing  Re reduces the  nanofluid’s radiation  extinc-
tion ability at the vicinity of the DASC upper wall as high Re affects
the  uniformity  of  nanoparticle  distribution.  At  high  Re,  a  traverse
nanoparticle  migration  from  upper  and  lower  walls,  where  shear
rates are high, to low shear rate regions is observed, which dilutes the
nanoparticle  concentration  near  DASC  top  and  bottom  walls.
Consequently,  the  major  light  absorption  and  thus  temperature
elevation occur in the nanofluid middle bulk rather than top layers,
which  mitigates  losses  to  surroundings  and  enhances  the  photo-
thermal  conversion  efficiency.  At  low  Re,  the  impact  of  shear-
induced  migration  is  counteracted  by  Brownian  diffusion,  leading
to nanoparticle homogenization within the collector. Conversely, in
high Re (i.e., convection-dominated) flows, the weaker influence of
Brownian diffusion in comparison to flow inertia intensifies nano-
particle migration.

-  Nanofluid-based DASC systems present a cost-effective solution over
the long term, despite the high initial costs of nanofluids. The use of
nanofluids  leads  to  more  efficient  and  compact  solar  collectors,
which lowers both the embodied energy and land requirements. This
efficiency gain not only compensates for the initial expense but also
plays  a  crucial  role  in  reducing  CO2  emissions,  aligning  with  the
goals  of  sustainable  and  eco-friendly  energy.  Additionally,  the
enhanced efficiency reduces the need for manufacturing materials,
thereby  diminishing  environmental  pollution.  Research  supports
that the broader adoption of solar energy, facilitated by nanofluids,
could  significantly  magnify  these  ecological  advantages,  high-
lighting their value in both the economic and environmental aspects
of  solar  technology.  On  the  other  hand,  nanoparticles  raise  envi-
ronmental and health concerns due to increased toxicity. These sub-
10nm  particles  act  like  gases,  entering  the  body  and  potentially
harming cells. Nanoparticle shape also influences toxicity, impacting
ecosystems and ultimately human health. A major challenge lies in
the  lack  of established  protocols for  safe  handling and  disposal  of
these  increasingly  prevalent  nanoparticles,  necessitating  robust
toxicity investigations for safe manufacturing practices.

Research gaps and future directions:

-  The Eulerian-Lagrangian approach can be expanded to involve the
kinetics of particle clustering in both static and flowing nanofluids.
Accordingly, the approach will be capable of forecasting the collision
frequency, attachment efficiency (probability of two particles stick-
ing  together  upon  collision),  and  colloidal  stability  in  nanofluid-
based  systems.  The  implementation  of  such  an  extension  can  be
performed through a set of key steps. Firstly, a hard sphere collision
model, identifying a critical particle velocity for clustering based on
momentum/energy  balance  pre-  and  post-impact,  should  be
employed. Thus, the model can determine if the collision will yield
rebound or clustering, relying on the relative kinetic and attractive/
repulsive potential energies between particles. Secondly, the char-
acteristics and dynamics of clusters as well as the particle-cluster and
cluster-cluster  interactions  should  be  identified.  Lastly,  modified
particle momentum and energy source terms will be implemented to
account for the particle size distribution impacts on the continuous
phase.

-  The  mathematical  model  of  DASC  systems  can  be  extended  to
accommodate  high-flux  scenarios  through  including  an  additional
term to the RTE to account for emission augmentation, taking into
account the blackbody radiation from the collector cover plate to the
working  fluid,  and  considering  both  the  radiative  and  convective
thermal losses from the collector upper plate.

-  The development of more accurate mathematical models to predict
the optical properties of nanofluids or extending the existing ones to
accommodate the impacts of the multiple scattering, agglomeration,
clustering of particles, medium temperature, and dynamic features in
nanofluids are essential.

-  Despite the usefulness of DLVO theory, it falls short when it comes to
fully describing the intricate interactions within nanofluids. A multi-
scale approach tackles this challenge by merging the strengths of two
simulation techniques: Atomistic simulations (MD) and system-level
simulations  (DPD,  Eulerian-Lagrangian).  MD  simulations  excel  at
calculating forces between individual nanoparticles at the nanoscale,
which  is  vital  for  understanding  stability.  However,  MD  becomes
computationally  demanding  as  the  number  of  particles  increases.
System-level simulations, on the other hand, can handle larger par-
ticle numbers and model complex interactions like colloidal behavior
and thermal effects, but struggle with capturing the finer details. The
multi-scale approach bridges this gap by utilizing MD for accurate
force  calculations,  which  are  then  incorporated  into  system-level
simulations.  This  combined  approach  provides  a  more  complete
picture  of  nanofluid  behavior,  ultimately  aiding  in  the  design  of

stable solar nanofluids and predicting their performance in practical
applications.

- Hybrid plasmonic nanofluids combine nanoparticles of varying ma-
terials, shapes, and/or sizes to enhance the broad-spectrum photo-
thermal  conversion  of  solar  radiation.  Blending  different  types  of
nanoparticles in specific proportions generate multiple LSPR peaks
aligning  with  the  solar  spectrum.  For  effective  design  of  hybrid
nanofluids,  it  is  necessary  to  extend  the  mathematical  model  by
incorporating interparticle interactions among diverse particle types.
This  necessitates  introducing  multiple  equations  for  particle  mo-
mentum and energy, along with integrating multiple particle source
terms that are interconnected with the fluid phase. Additionally, an
expansion of the classical Mie theory becomes essential to assess the
optical properties of non-spherical nanoparticles.

-  An  in-depth  economic  assessment  of  the  nanofluid-based  DASCs
seems as a critical knowledge gap. Cost-benefit and life-cycle ana-
lyses  of  DASCs  should  be  necessarily  undertaken  to  evaluate  the
feasibility  of  the  DASC  technology  transition  from  the  lab  to  the
commercial large-scale production. Additionally, the environmental
implications of DASCs in terms of carbon mitigation potential and
harmful-emission reduction should be thoroughly studied.

-  Although nanofluid-based DASCs must be extensively tested under
real-world conditions to validate their reliability alleged in theory, a
very few studies based on field testing exist in the literature.

- Standardization of the nanofluid-based DASC technology by devel-
oping  industry  protocols  and  standards  including  roadmaps  for
successful  selection  of  the  nanoparticle  material  type,  size,  shape,
and  loading,  the  compatible  base  fluid,  the  DASC  geometry  di-
mensions, the flow properties, etc., can guarantee high and consis-
tent  performance  and  encourage  and  facilitate  commercialization
and widespread adoption.

-  Although  recent  studies  suggested  magnetic  and  electric  fields  to
support the nanoparticle dispersion and stability in DASCs, offering
practical  techniques,  that  support  the  stability  and  uniform  distri-
bution of nanoparticles and keep them from agglomeration, is still a
crucial challenge. Such techniques should guarantee efficient solar
absorption and volumetric heat generation in DASCs.

-  The  base  fluid  type,  nanoparticle  material  type,  size,  shape,  and
loading,  flow  velocity,  collector  length,  collector  height,  collector
bottom surface type, etc. are interrelated parameters, and their col-
lective  impacts  on  the  optical  and  thermal  performance  of  DASCs
require further examination. Also, the impact of a specific parameter
on the performance of a DASC may vary from one study to another
due to differences in other parameters.

-  For example, collector length will not influence two DASCs with two
different  fV  values  the  same  way,  as  detailed  earlier.  Such  in-
consistencies  may  create  a  perception  that  results  of  the  different
studies are not in agreement with each other, which means that a
collective  impact should be considered when comparing  results of
different investigations.

- A  viable  future  path  is  integrating  DASCs  with  current  grid  infra-
structure  and  solar  energy  systems.  Combining  DASCs  with  other
renewable energy sources to create a hybrid system has the potential
to increase system reliability and total energy production.

-  As  for  the  erosion  and  corrosion  threats,  employing  nanoparticles
introduces  a  significant  problem.  Researchers,  as  detailed  earlier,
investigated  the  corrosion  of  metal  and  metal-oxide  nanoparticles
and  found  that  Cu  and  Al  pipes  significantly  degraded  whereas
stainless  steel  pipes  were  unaffected.  As  a  result,  stainless  steel
components are advised for the hydraulic circuits of nanofluid-based
DASCs. According to various researchers, corrosion is influenced by
the type of nanoparticles, with carbon-based nanofluids showing less
corrosion  potential  than  metal-  or  metal  oxide-based  nanofluids
[292,392,393]. This adds one more advantage to the carbon-based
nanoparticles besides their superior OTPs.
