Solar CO 2 /H 2 O splitting via two-step thermochemical cycles of metal oxides is a promising path for solar
energy conversion to carbon-neutral, liquid hydrocarbons from virtually inexhaustible resources, water
and (waste) carbon dioxide, with high theoretical efficiency potential. Cerium-based oxides have seen
enormous interest and research effort s since they were proposed for this application, mainly due to their
good stability at high temperatures and fast kinetics in redox reactions. The current state-of the-art re-
view on the advancements of thermochemical cycles performed with the aid of cerium-based oxides
is presented in this work, with emphasis on the latest developments during the last decade. Reaction
principles, material modifications, reaction kinetics and finally solar reactors developed and operated are
discussed in detail to provide a comprehensive understanding of the nature of the specific material and
the factors impacting on the system efficiency. This efficiency depends on a combination of redox ma-
terial/solar reactor/operation mode. With respect to the material issue, even though most studies have
been targeted on improving the reduction conditions by suitable doping (e.g. Zr and Hf), the experience
accumulated so far points to the direction of improving the oxidation step, provided the reduction step
is performed below a critical, operationally feasible temperature. Thus the efficiency-optimal solar opera-
tion mode should be based on a trade-off between material reduction and oxidation performance and on
another trade-off between solid and gas heat requirements and suitable recuperation strategies. The lat-
ter are highly dependent on the concept of solar reactor chosen and have to be demonstrated efficiently
in real cyclic, field-test operation. The development of more effective oxygen removal strategies to lower
the oxygen partial pressure during reduction may bring great improvement to efficiency.

1. Introduction

Concentrating solar thermal systems are special mirror assem-
blies that track the sun and concentrate its radiation [1] . They are
a 100% renewable approach, utilizing the entire sunlight spectrum
with high efficiency  potential for the  conversion of solar  energy
to  medium-  to  high-temperature  heat  and  through  that  to  elec-
tricity or chemical substances [2–5] . In contrast to photovoltaics,
concentrated solar energy can be integrated with cost-effective and
high-density energy storage in the form of either heat [6] or trans-
portable and exploitable energy carriers [7–12] . Among such en-
ergy carriers, hydrogen is the prime candidate not only because it
can be used directly as a fuel itself, but since it can be also further
converted via industrially known processes into liquid hydrocarbon
fuels that currently form the backbone of our energy mix, conve-
niently used in commercial plants and vehicles [13–22] . Water on
the other hand, is the obvious hydrogen raw material choice due to
its abundance, low value and absence of CO
2 emissions during its
dissociation (water splitting - WS) to hydrogen and oxygen. Thus,
the exploitation of concentrated solar energy for H
2 O dissociation
2 , offers an attractive perspective of a sustainable en-
to produce H
ergy economy.

Despite its conceptual simplicity, direct thermal decomposition
2 O  needs  very  high  temperatures  ( > 2500 K)  and  poses  very
of  H
challenging difficulties on hydrogen–oxygen high-temperature sep-
aration and avoidance of explosive mixtures [10,11,15,16] . Therefore,
it is more feasible to decompose water through multi-step chem-
ical reaction schemes, the so-called thermochemical cycles (with
the  net  reaction  being  still  water  decomposition)  with  the  help
of other media reactants/products [17–20,23] . All such schemes in-
clude an endothermic step needed for the release of O
2 , which is
the highest-temperature step of the cycle, but, nevertheless, takes
place at a temperature much lower than that of the single-step wa-
ter thermolysis. In most cases, the required temperature decreases
when  more  steps  are  employed,  but  so  does  the  efficiency  po-
tential due to the energy losses associated with heat transfer and
products separation in each step [4,16,23] . To our knowledge, ther-
mochemical  cycles  have  been  discussed  as  a  potential  hydrogen
source for the first time in 1966, motivated by a potential future
increase in hydrocarbon cost and other factors  [24] . The earliest
more  detailed  studies  on  thermochemical  cycles  in  the  mid-70 s
to  mid-80 s  provoked  by  the  oil  crisis,  were  mainly  initiated  by
the nuclear energy sector and focused on coupling the endother-
mic step of multi-step cycles to high temperature nuclear reactors

diversifying  thus  the  use  of  the  reactors’  thermal  energy  supply
[23,25,26] . From the late 80 s, the interest in thermochemical cy-
cles decreased drastically; in parallel nuclear industry-relevant re-
search in the 1990s was based on the assumption of successful de-
velopment of nuclear reactors capable of achieving temperatures
of up to 1223 K under the Generation IV program [27] . While the
initial development roadmap foresaw deployment of such reactors
by 2020, more recent, realistic estimates postpone this timeframe
between 2025 and 2030 [28] . The interest on thermochemical cy-
cles was re-vitalized by the turn of the millennium in conjunction
with the climate change societal debate that caused a shift towards
decarbonization of our energy chain and relevant political direc-
tives for greenhouse-gas-free hydrogen production from renewable
or carbon-neutral energy. In this framework, solar energy, and in
particular concentrated solar radiation, moved stronger into the fo-
cus of interest than nuclear energy as a heat source, basically due
to its unmatched magnitude, availability and scalability to any fu-
ture energy demand but also due to the fact that it enjoys much
higher public acceptance than nuclear energy, which is often as-
sociated by the public with nuclear waste disposal challenges and
unpredictable accidents such as Three Mile Island, Chernobyl and
Fukushima [29] .

2. Oxide redox pair-based water/carbon dioxide splitting
thermochemical cycles

Among  the  various  water  splitting  thermochemical  cycle
schemes  explored  for  hydrogen  production  [30] ,  those  based  on
oxide redox pair systems are the only ones that are directly ap-
plicable  also  to  carbon  dioxide  splitting  (CDS)  and/or  combined
CO
2 O splitting for CO/syngas production respectively. Such cy-
cles involve only two steps and operate on the principle of tran-
sition between the oxidized (higher-valence) and reduced (lower-
valence) form of an oxide of a metal exhibiting multiple oxidation
states, which could be expressed as:

2 /H

oxidation :  M O

x −δ + δH 2 O → M O x + δH 2

or  M O

x −δ + δC O 2 → M O x + δCO

The temperatures required for the thermal reduction (TR) step
are much lower than those for water thermolysis but nevertheless
still relatively high ranging from 1600 to 1900 K, depending on the
kind of the redox material employed and the partial pressure of
oxygen  during  reduction.  Thus,  these  redox  oxide  cycles  are  not
suitable for coupling to advanced high-temperature fission nuclear
reactions (or future fusion reactions), for which the optimum tem-
perature  level  is  deemed  about  1100–1250 K;  lower-temperature
cycles  such  as  those  of  the  sulphur  family  [31] ,  the  4-step
calcium–bromine–iron  (UT-3)  cycle  [32]  or  the  copper–chlorine
ones [33] , are currently considered for coupling to nuclear plants
instead [14] .

On  the  contrary,  redox  oxide  cycles  are  perfectly  compatible
with large-scale sunlight concentrating systems capable of achiev-
ing working temperatures above 20 0 0 K and particularly with so-
lar towers as it will be described in more detail below [2,7,20,23] .
In such a context, in the first step (reduction, endothermic), the
metal oxide is reduced with concentrated solar irradiation as the
energy  source  required  for  the  high-temperature  process.  In  the
second step (oxidation, exothermic), the reduced oxide material is
oxidized by CO
2 and becomes again ready
to be reduced, in an ideally indefinite cyclic use. Metal oxides used
as  WS/CDS  medium  are  recycled  and  no  corrosive  or  poisonous

2 O to produce CO/H

2 /H

substances are produced. Only water, carbon dioxide and solar en-
ergy are the input and hydrogen and/or carbon monoxide the only
products. The commercially practiced conversion of syngas (a mix-
ture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide) to liquid fuels via e.g. the
Fischer–Tropsch (FT) technology [34] , together with the possibil-
ity  of  employing  and  “valorizing” atmospheric  CO
2  as  a  carbon-
containing  raw  material  for  the  production  of  such  fuels,  imply
that  the  particular  route  can,  in  principle,  essentially  culminate
to the synthesis of carbon-neutral, liquid hydrocarbons. These are
then formed from purely renewable and virtually inexhaustible re-
sources: solar energy, water and (waste) carbon dioxide. This per-
spective justifies the tremendous interest that these cycles have at-
tracted and the large number of research efforts dedicated therein
worldwide.

2.1. Stoichiometric vs. partial reduction (oxygen-vacancies) chemistry

3 O

Such  a  two-step  cycle  was  firstly  proposed  in  1977  with  the
redox pair Fe
4 /FeO (magnetite/wüstite) [35] . Over the decades,
a lot of other redox pairs have been proposed as material candi-
dates for this application. The oxidized state of the redox material
can  be  reduced  either  to  a  lower-metal-valence  oxide  or  all  the
way  to  the  respective  metal  (of  zero  valence).  However,  a  more
generalized  categorization  can  be  made  according  to  the  reduc-
tion  mechanism,  into  stoichiometric  (or  phase-change)  materials
and  non-stoichiometric  (or  partial  reduction  or  oxygen-vacancy)
ones  [36] .  In  the  materials  of  the  first  category,  all  the  cations
of the multi-valent metal are transformed from the higher to the
lower oxidation state during reduction and vice versa during oxida-
tion releasing/absorbing oxygen gas in a stoichiometric proportion
and this process scheme is characterized by a total phase change
of the redox material involving major re-arrangements of atoms.
Such a phase change can be either from solid-to-solid (i.e. change
of lattice structure, like the Co
4 /CoO pair), from solid-to-liquid
3 O
(Fe
4 /FeO pair) or from solid-to-gas (ZnO/Zn pair). In the materi-
als of the second category, the reduction product does not contain
all the reducible metal cations at their lower valence state but only
a smaller percentage of them, since δ in reactions (1) –(2) is usu-
ally much smaller than 1, and oxygen is allowed to move through
and  leave  the  lattice  through  the  formation  of  oxygen  vacancies
without causing phase transformations that induce crystal struc-
ture disruption; hence these are also frequently called O-vacancy
materials [37,38] .

mented by performing thermodynamic calculations of the reduc-
tion enthalpy and the Gibbs free energy of the two cycle steps as a
function of temperature and oxygen partial pressure, using stan-
dard  enthalpies  and  entropies  of  formation  of  the  oxidized  and
reduced compounds. As can be gleaned from the respective liter-

2.2. Volatile vs. non-volatile thermochemical cycles

At  this  point,  in  order  to  further  stress  the  need  for  closely
coupling redox chemistry to the solar reactor concept to be em-
ployed and for interconnection, feedback and parallel development
of the two, a first discussion relevant to an emblematic exemplary
case becomes pertinent. Since the temperatures required for the
thermal decomposition reactions are high, they often exceed the
boiling temperatures of the reduced species. Thus, in general, re-
dox pairs can be classified as volatile (ZnO/Zn [41–44] , SnO
2 /SnO
[43,45] , CdO/Cd [46] , GeO
2 /GeO [47] ) and non-volatile (to be de-
scribed in detail later on), depending on whether the redox ma-
terial  remains  in  the  condensed  state  during  the  entire  process
or  not.  This  classification  criterion  derives  from  the  distinct  dif-
ference in handling the reactive material in the system level and
the  solar  reactor  design  that  has  to  be  employed  to  implement
such reactions. The solid-to-gas phase transition of the other-than-
oxygen  product  (either the  metal or  the  lower-valence oxide)  of
the volatile cycles, is on the one hand a thermodynamic advantage
beneficial for the process, because a high entropy gain is obtained.
Indeed, from thermodynamic calculations of the enthalpy and en-
tropy of the two cycle steps as well as of the specific and molar
energy storage (the latter being inversely proportional to the en-
ergy required to heat the oxide during the cycle), it is clear that
among redox oxide cycles, the ZnO/Zn one has by far the supe-
rior thermodynamics [36] with respect to theoretical process ef-
ficiency. Therefore, it has been the most extensively studied cycle
for quite some time, mainly by the group at Swiss Federal Institute
of Technology/Paul Scherrer Institute (ETH/PSI) in Zurich, Switzer-
land and the groups of PROMES (Laboratoire PROcédés, Matériaux
et Energie Solaire) in Odeillo, France and of University of Colorado
(UoC), Boulder, U.S.A. Comparative systematic studies followed on
2 /SnO cycle (PROMES) and only very sparse ones on other
the SnO
such volatile cycles initially proposed (CdO/Cd, GeO
2 /GeO). To fa-
cilitate the comparison of the fuel (CO/H
2 ) production potential of
different materials, here we define the fuel productivity as the ra-
2 output to the mass of material before reduction. Both
tio of CO/H
ZnO/Zn and SnO
2 /SnO cycles are characterized by very high fuel
productivities, 12.29 mol/kg and 6.64 mol/kg respectively. Unfortu-
nately though, the decomposition temperature of ZnO is very high
2  slightly  lower  ( ∼1873 K)  [41–44] .
( > 20 0 0 K),  while  that  of  SnO
Furthermore, such volatile systems possess also inherently a ma-
jor technical drawback: the reduction products of both materials
Zn(g) and SnO(g) (as well as these of every other volatile cycle) are
gaseous species and as the temperature in the reduction reactor
decreases, the products tend to recombine with the other gaseous
species produced, i.e. oxygen. Recombination results in low yields
of Zn/SnO, leading to low overall yields of CO/H
2  and poor pro-
cess economics [18,19,45,48] . Hence, volatile cycles have to involve
a separation/quenching process of the reduced material (gas) and
oxygen in the reduction step, something not needed in non-volatile
cycles. In addition, in the subsequent oxidation step, as zinc parti-
cles react with H
2 , a layer of zinc oxide may form on the
outside of the particle, which acts as a diffusion barrier, effectively
passivating  the  rest  of  the  particle  [48] .  Even  though  significant
progress has been made over the last years on scaling up a solar
reactor for ZnO decomposition, the opinions of two of the research
groups among the most actively involved in such volatile WS/CDS
thermochemical cycles, as expressed in their most recent review
articles, seem to converge with respect to the limited possibility of
commercialization of such cycles:

2 O/CO

“...While the SnO 2 /SnO solar thermal water splitting (STWS) cycle
appears to be more promising than the ZnO/Zn cycle, the SnO 2 /SnO
cycle is still plagued by low recovery of the reduced material and
the  difficulties  inherent  in  quenching  the  reduction  product  and

handling the resulting reduced solids. Without significant improve-
ments to address these issues, volatile stoichiometric STWS cycles
will likely be impractical for commercial water splitting...” (UoC,
[ 18 ]); “...we conclude that one should not proceed with solar fuel
production using the Zn/ZnO thermochemical cycle unless signifi-
cant advances are made in product separation and/or efficient in-
ert gas recycling.”

(ETH/PSI, [49] ).

3 O

Non-volatile  cycles  employ  redox  pair  oxides  which  remain
condensed during the whole process, bypass the recombination is-
sue inherent in volatile cycles and include a wide variety of metal
oxide families today. Thus, research efforts on the non-volatile ox-
ides  of  the  second  group  above  –these  that  their  reduced  state
could split water - were targeted on lowering their thermal reduc-
tion temperatures by either modifying their composition and/or by
reducing the oxygen partial pressure during reduction. The “origi-
4 /FeO redox pair was considered to be a promising candi-
nal” Fe
date due to its relevantly high fuel productivity (4.32 mol/kg) and
lower reduction temperature than ZnO and has been widely stud-
ied [50,51] . Fe
4 could be reduced at 1673 K at low oxygen partial
pressure created by inert gas; unfortunately, the melting tempera-
ture of the reduced phase FeO is lower ( ∼1623 K), a fact causing
practical difficulties in handling a liquid material during the pro-
cess [10] . Partial substitution of Fe cations with those of other tran-
sition metals, led to the introduction of, the well-known from the

of ferrite compositions on redox-inert materials like zirconia was
employed  to  lower  the  reduction  temperature  and  alleviate  sin-
tering [54–59] ; however, deactivation is still an inevitable problem
and using a redox-inert support leads to lower fuel productivity.

Two-step thermochemical cycles based on ceria for solar fuel
production were first investigated by the PROMES group for both
water and carbon dioxide splitting in 2006 [40] . A stoichiometric
change from CeO
3 (corresponding to a fuel productivity
of 2.91 mol/kg) was realized. The reduction temperature was about
2273 K, which is too high for practical applications; CeO
2 was al-
ready in the molten state, a large fraction was lost due to subli-
mation and, naturally, significant sintering was observed as well
[60] . However, in 2009, a research group at California Institute of
Technology  (Caltech),  Pasadena,  U.S.A.,  proposed  a  similar  ceria-
based  cycle  for  water/carbon  dioxide  splitting  but  based  on  its
non-stoichiometric  reduction  (CeO

2.3. Current state-of-the-art partial reduction redox oxides

Thus, after 2009, research not only on ceria, but on other redox
oxide material families, has shifted towards this direction, i.e. per-
forming the reduction at temperatures below their melting points
and under partial reduction conditions. In addition to the already
mentioned  ferrites,  research  with  perovskites  – that  represent  a
large group of materials with AMO
3 structure, where A is usually
an alkaline, alkali, or rare earth metal, and M is usually a transi-
tion metal – emerged in this context after 2013. Perovskites oper-
ate via similar reduction mechanism (defect equilibrium) and were
investigated as substitutes of ceria with the advantage of higher
reduction extent at lower temperatures ( ∼1573 K) [64–70] .

In an approach common for all three material families, ferrites,
ceria and perovskites, numerous stoichiometry modifications were

attempted experimentally and modeled thermodynamically seek-
ing compositions with enhanced redox/thermal stability character-
istics at lower temperatures. However, as aptly pointed out in [37] ,
in  the  thermodynamic  calculations  employed  in  the  early  stages
of the relevant research, the vast majority of simple binary metal
oxides (MOx) have been examined for their suitability as WS/CDS
redox  pairs  under  the  assumption  that  they  operate  via  volatile
or non-volatile stoichiometric mechanisms. Obviously, such calcula-
tions were not adequate to describe the behavior of partial reduc-
tion materials, and, as already pointed out by the research group
of SANDIA National Labs (SNL) U.S.A., considering full reduction-
oxidation of all metal cations to the lower or higher valence re-
spectively, provides only the upper limits of expected efficiencies.
The  same group demonstrated that  allowing only  the  ideal, sto-
ichiometric compound FeO as a potential decomposition product

decomposition temperature and emphasized the significance of in-
cluding solution phases rather than only stoichiometric compounds
in thermodynamic modeling [71] . In fact, it is surprising that af-
ter these elaborations and ample experimental evidence that, pro-
vided the reduction temperatures do not exceed a certain value,
the ferrites operate also under the O-vacancies mechanism oscil-
lating between their oxygen-rich and oxygen- deficient phase be-
fore  and  after  reduction  [72–74] ,  many  research  groups  confuse
them still with the Fe
4 /FeO redox pair and consider that they
work in a stoichiometric mode, dissociating for example to nickel/
cobalt/manganese/zinc etc.- and iron oxides upon oxygen release.

Thus,  with  the  advancement  of  the  available  computational
tools arsenal, the implementation of the “materials screening” task
was complemented by molecular level Density Functional Theory
(DFT) calculations on the enthalpy of formation of oxide vacancies
in  the  crystal  lattice  of  possible  promising  multi-element  mixed
oxide compositions as a function of the composition, dopants’ kind
and concentration, to guide in a rational way from the molecular
level up, suitable doping strategies. Given the wide range of dopant
cations that can be accommodated in the crystal structure of stable
ferrites, ceria and perovskite compounds it is of no surprise that
literally hundreds of compound compositions have been screened
so far.

In addition to the ferrites, ceria and perovskite cycles, a fourth

to operate as per the stoichiometric mechanism described by re-
actions ( 3a )–( 3b ) below [75] . It was reported that the cobalt fer-

producing hydrogen and oxygen at (nearly) the same temperature
level  [75–77] .  Despite  the  encouraging  results  reported  initially,
subsequent publications of the same group could not confirm the
hypothesized reaction scheme [18] . On the contrary, their theoret-
ical DFT studies [37] showed that Fe- and Co-aluminates operating
via the stoichiometric reaction mechanism ( 3a )–( 3b ) have insuffi-
cient reducing power to split water, but could nevertheless oper-
ate as redox pairs via an O-vacancy mechanism, similar to that of
the other three material families, in particular to that of the spinel
ferrites.

rently converges to performing the cycles below the melting point
of the redox pair keeping it practically in the solid state through-
out the process and operating the material in the partial reduction
mode, to avoid further lattice structural changes. Under this mode,
the three state-of-the-art material families, ferrites, ceria and per-
ovskites (as well as the hercynite-based family) operate in a similar
manner and suffer from the same limitations imposed basically by
the small width of change in the non-stoichiometry δ. Not only is
the change in δ small, but, furthermore, Eqs. (1) , ( 2a ) and ( 2b ) as
written in their present form imply that δ is common for both cy-
cle steps; in other words that all oxygen released from the oxide
during thermal reduction is fully replenished by oxygen abstracted
from water or carbon dioxide during oxidation. This, of course, is
necessary to reversibly execute splitting reactions. Given that on
the one hand, even for the same redox oxide material, the quantity
of oxygen released during reduction is not something constant but
depends on the particular temperature and oxygen partial pressure
of the reduction experiment and that on the other hand the ox-
idation  conditions  might  disfavor  full  substitution  of  the  oxygen
released, the following nomenclature is adopted, where the sub-
scripts x- δ
red and x- δοx respectively represent the state of reduc-
tion/oxidation  reached  at  a  particular  experiment  under  a  given
temperature and oxygen partial pressure:

It  should  be  mentioned  here  in  passing,  that  in  addition  to
WS/CDS,  redox  oxide-based  thermochemical  cycles  can  be  bene-
ficial also in other concentrated solar energy applications; for in-
stance after the thermal reduction step, oxygen (air) can be used
as oxidant instead of H
2 /CO. The rationale in this case is to recover
the heat used on-sun to drive the endothermic reduction step by
performing the reverse, exothermic oxidation step off-sun, gener-
ating thus the heat necessary for electricity production when sun
is  not  available.  Thermodynamic  specific  and  molar  energy  stor-
age  calculations  accounting  for  the  energy  required  to  heat  the
oxides have demonstrated that partial reduction materials like ce-
ria  have  much  lower  energy  storage  density  compared  to  phase
change materials, as one might expect due to their small stoichio-
metric changes [36] . Hence, redox oxide pairs operating stoichio-
metrically - Co
2 O - are considered as
the most promising candidates for thermochemical storage of so-
lar heat, which have the additional benefit of being reducible under
air atmosphere , at “reasonable” temperatures, a feature rendering
them compatible with solar tower power plants employing air as
the heat transfer fluid [78] . Unfortunately, all these systems above
are incapable of WS/CDS. Despite their low chemical storage den-
sity, low cost perovskites from earth abundant elements are also
considered, due to their reasonably high sensible heat storage and
stability.

solar energy

3.1. Solar reactors’ boundary conditions and solar concentration
systems

The material families operating in the partial reduction mode
share many commonalities. By remaining throughout the cycle in

the solid state, they offer more possibilities for a common reactor
concept, process design and operation mode; they are also compat-
ible with the possible use of either particle or structured receiver-
reactors. In the former category the solid particles are distributed
randomly in space whereas in the latter are “arranged” being free
of randomness at the reactor level by being incorporated in mono-
lithic structures such as honeycombs, foams, fins, coatings or mem-
branes [79] . Both kinds of such reactors will be described in more
detail later.

The  redox  materials  chemistry  imposes  the  “boundary  condi-
tions” on the solar reactor. The elaborate thermodynamic analysis
on these redox pair systems has shown that the partial molar en-
thalpy and entropy of their reactions must lie within a certain de-
sirable range, defined by negative Gibbs free energy changes for
the two reactions. With respect to the oxygen that can be released
during the reduction step, all three material families are limited
by the small width of the non-stoichiometry swing δ, as discussed
above. However the different material families are characterized by
different “boundary conditions” with respect to the temperatures
required.  Further  elaboration  among  the  comparative  advantages
and drawbacks of the various material families will be provided
at the concluding sections, after having elucidated the solar oper-
ation process intricacies and requirements. At this point let us just
summarize  that  between  the  two  most  studied  systems,  ferrites
and ceria, the former have demonstrated higher levels of reduction
at lower temperatures and thus the higher TR temperatures of ce-
ria might necessitate the use of more specialized (hence typically
more expensive) reactor materials.

The consensus of the scientific community active in the field is
that the easier the redox pair system material becomes to reduce,
the less likely it is for it to split water/carbon dioxide under prac-
tical conditions [80] . This counteracts the need to keep the reduc-
tion temperature low enough to reach a practically feasible pro-
cess. Thus a very narrow window for thermodynamic feasibility is
actually available. A further technical baseline is that despite ex-
tensive research on multi-cation combinations in all three material
families above and the fact that some doped perovskites exhibit
an onset of oxygen release as low as 1123 K albeit under very low
oxygen partial pressures, currently there is no system among them
exhibiting a meaningful significant oxygen release at thermal reduc-
tion temperatures below 1573 K even at the lowest partial pressures
of oxygen achieved under either inert sweeping gas atmosphere or
vacuum. Such temperature levels superimpose challenging reactor
construction  requirements  and  operation  conditions  to  those  for
the redox material: special construction and insulation materials
with respect to refractoriness, solar absorbance, resistance against
thermal shock and fatigue must be considered together with pos-
sible evaporation of volatile compounds, reactant loss or compo-
sition changes, activity deterioration or side reactions with the re-
actor materials. They also exclude lower-temperature-level concen-
tration facilities like parabolic troughs and Fresnel systems, leaving
only  solar  towers  and  dishes  as  the  high-temperature-heat  con-
centrated solar irradiation source of choice; furthermore, scalabil-
ity criteria rule out also solar dishes due to their size limitations.
Hence, research and development work on potential commercial-
ization of thermochemical WS/CDS is targeted on eventually im-
plementing thermochemical cycles on solar tower facilities, with
pre-development tests performed in either solar simulator or so-
lar furnace ones. In this context, as the first step towards solar fu-
els production, the traditional solar receivers used in solar power
tower plants have to be converted to receivers/reactors to perform
endothermic  reactions.  The  various  types  of  such  solar  receivers
and reactors have been extensively reviewed, among others from
the group of the present authors [19,49,81–83] , thus only a brief
discussion of the main points described therein follows.

3.2. Solar tower receivers: cavity/external and
directly/indirectly-irradiated ones

Leaving for a moment aside the chemical reactions, let us ad-
dress at first briefly the type of solar receivers employed in solar
towers. A solar receiver is nothing else but a heat exchanger lo-
cated at the common focal point of the sun-tracking mirrors (he-
liostats); its mission is to capture the high temperature heat sup-
plied  by  the  concentrated  solar  irradiation  efficiently  and  trans-
fer  it  at  the  maximum  possible  temperature  to  a  heat  transfer
fluid (HTF) which, in turn, will transfer this heat wherever needed
downstream (in solar thermal power plants typically to a steam
cycle for electricity generation). This HTF can be a gas (e.g. air or
steam), a liquid (e.g. a molten salt or a molten metal) or even a
“solid” (a flowing stream of particles). There are different solar re-
ceiver classifications criteria depending on the construction geom-
etry solution or the heat transfer mechanism to the thermal fluid
employed.

According  to  their  geometrical  configuration,  solar  tower  re-
ceivers can be classified into external and cavity-type ones ( Fig. 1 a
- [84] ). External receivers are arranged so that to absorb sunlight
from  all  around  the  solar  field;  for  instance  they  can  be  tubu-
lar  external  panels  arranged  in  a  cylindrical  configuration.  Cavi-
ties are well-insulated enclosures containing the absorber material,
receiving  the  concentrated  solar  radiation  through  a  small  aper-
ture  and  designed  to  favor  multiple  reflections  of  the  entering
sun rays among their inner walls ideally resulting in blackbody-
behavior. Cavities operate under a compromise between the maxi-
mum energy to be absorbed and that to be irradiated back through
the aperture; a larger aperture will deliver more sunlight into the
cavity but will also allow more of it to escape back through re-
radiation of the inner cavity walls. As it will be shown below, the
two concepts can be combined: tubular receivers can be enclosed
within cavities so that they can be irradiated by sunrays impinging
upon their outer surface, emanating not only directly from the he-
liostats but also, after multiple reflections, from the inner cavity
walls.  Finally,  a  third,  so-called  “beam-down” configuration,  em-
ploys a second, hyperbolical reflector placed at the top of a tower
to re-direct sunlight to a receiver located at ground level; the re-
ceiver, in turn, can be either cavity- or external-like one.

Alternatively,  according  to  the  mechanism  of  transferring  the
solar  heat  to  the  HTF,  solar  receivers  can  be  distinguished  to
indirectly– and  directly–irradiated  ones  ( Fig.  1 b–e).  The  former
consist of absorbing surfaces exposed to the concentrated solar ra-
diation, with heat conducted across their walls to the thermal fluid
moving in a direction vertical to that of the incident solar radia-
tion; the simplest examples are conventional tubular receivers in
the interior of which the HTF flows (such as the usually cylindri-
cally shaped, black-painted, tubular external receiver panels men-
tioned above, Fig. 1 e-left). The latter, make use of solid media, ei-
ther  particles  or  structured  bulk  bodies,  directly  exposed  to  the
concentrated solar radiation. In different designs, the absorber is
either a stationary matrix (grid, wire-mesh, honey-comb, foam -
Fig. 1 b), or moving solid particles ( Fig. 1 c) and the HTF becomes
heated  by  flowing  in  contact  to  the  already  hot  solid.  Receivers
of the first design are also called and “volumetric”, since they en-
able the concentrated solar radiation to penetrate and be absorbed
within the entire volume of the absorber [85] .

3.3. Solar redox pair oxide receiver/reactors: operation modes and
categorization

To  convert  a  receiver  to  a  receiver/reactor,  concepts  from
“traditional” chemical  reactor  engineering  should  be  combined
with efficient ways of heating the reactor via concentrated solar

irradiation. In contrast to classical gas–solid catalytic chemical re-
actor engineering, in solar redox oxide chemistry the solid reactant
(metal  oxide)  is  not  a  “catalyst” present  in  much  smaller  quan-
tities than the gaseous reactants but a reactant itself, with non-
negligible mass; this mass on the one hand needs to be heated to

the reaction (reduction) temperature and on the other hand gets
progressively depleted as the reaction proceeds and has to be re-
plenished.

With  respect  to  the  issue  of  redox  material  replenishment,
there  exist  two  possible  technical  solutions:  either  new  mass  of

the solid material has to be fed constantly into the reactor(s) if the
reactions are to be performed in a continuous mode, or practical
and feasible ways have to be engineered for in-situ cyclic opera-
tion (reduction-oxidation) of a given oxide mass. The latter case
essentially is a batch solar fuel (H
2 /CO/syngas) production from a
specific mass of redox material; a process “continuous” with re-
spect to time can be materialized by a series of reactor modules
in parallel, out of which some perform the thermal reduction step
while the splitting step is implemented on the rest, and then the
operation of the two groups is reversed.

Let us now address the issue of heating the solid reactant to
the desired temperature. As already mentioned, WS thermochemi-
cal cycles for hydrogen production were initially coined by the nu-
clear energy sector with the rationale of exploiting the thermal en-
ergy supplied by nuclear reactors. In this context, a HTF (e.g. high-
temperature Helium coming from nuclear reactors) would be used
to heat a TR/WS reactor indirectly and “allothermally”. In contrast,
the  high  temperatures  required  so  far  for  the  TR  step  in  redox-
oxide based thermochemical cycles disfavor the use of such “al-
lothermal” solar reactors where heating of the reactor has to be
implemented through a solar-heated HTF like air, molten salt, liq-
uid  metal or  moving  particle stream ( Fig. 1 e).  Problems of  indi-
rectly  heated  reactors  relevant  to  the  resistance  to  heat  transfer
and the tube materials temperature, limit the actual heat flux to
the reaction site (inner region of the tube at left); thus there are
only few examples of such reactors that have been proposed and
employed. The majority of solar redox oxide reactors tested so far
employ  solid  particles  or  structures  directly  absorbing  the  con-
centrated solar radiation. Given that the working fluid at the TR
stage cannot be air, such receiver–reactors must be equipped with
a transparent window, which allows concentrated light to enter the
receiver while isolating the working gas from ambient air and pro-
viding for operation under non-atmospheric pressures if needed.

Further complications stem from the different conditions favor-
ing each of the respective two cycle steps thermochemically: ther-
mal reduction is favored by high temperatures and low oxygen par-
2 ) splitting is favored by low tem-
tial pressures whereas (H
peratures and high H
2  partial pressures. However, splitting
temperatures should be on the one hand high enough to ensure
satisfactory splitting reaction kinetics/rates and on the other hand
low  enough  to  avoid  inducing  thermal  reduction  simultaneously
with splitting. Hence, splitting reactions should, in principle, take
place at relatively high temperatures (typically 10 0 0–120 0 K), but
at lower temperatures than the thermal reduction. The complete
cyclic operation has to be carried out under a “temperature-swing”
mode,  in  parallel  with  an  “oxygen  partial  pressure-swing” mode
where the gaseous feed to the metal oxide has to switch between
H
2 and inert purge gas or vacuum. This temperature/oxygen
partial pressure swing operation principle is irrespective of the re-
dox  material  choice  and  introduces  further  complications  to  the
design of the solar reactor in terms of oxide material handling and
efficient heat utilization between the two reaction steps.

2 O/CO

As far as the first issue of material handling is concerned, there
exist two fundamental technical concepts for alternating the op-
erating status of the solid reactants periodically, attaining either a
2 /CO/syngas  production,  which  can
continuous  or  a  batch-wise  H
be  distinguished  based  on  whether  the  reactors  employ  moving
or  only  stationary  solid  parts.  In  the  first,  continuous  produc-
tion  is  achieved  by  moving  (a  part  of)  the  reactive  particles  or
structures  from  a  thermal  reduction  reactor  or  zone  to  a  split-
ting reactor/zone (and another part to the opposite direction). The
two reactors/zones operate at different temperatures and at least
the thermal reduction reactor is heated by solar irradiation. Gas
streams and solar irradiation are provided continuously and con-
stantly to the two reaction chambers, as per their needs. Solar fuel
is continuously produced in the splitting reactor by maintaining a

continuous feed of redox material into the reactor. In the second
concept, reduction and splitting take place in one single reaction
chamber avoiding thus any solids transportation. This is the con-
cept of batch-wise fuel production with respect to a given reactor
containing a specific mass of solid mentioned above, which can be
rendered continuous with respect to time via a series of reactor
modules in parallel. Periodic operation switching of a single reac-
tor chamber/module from reduction to splitting is implemented by
alternating the gas streams from reducing to oxidizing atmosphere
and, simultaneously, adjusting the solar flux densities to realize the
two different temperature levels and heat demands of the two re-
actions, typically by diverting the solar flux. The two modes differ
with respect to oxygen/hydrogen separation implementation; the
first involves spatial products separation: oxygen and hydrogen are
produced simultaneously at different locations, whereas the sec-
ond employs temporal products separation producing oxygen and
hydrogen sequentially at the same location. In short, it can be said
that the former concept is based on moving solid material whereas
the latter on moving gases and sunrays.

The second issue relevant to temperature swing operation, i.e.
efficient heat utilization, is inherently coupled to any solar reac-
tor type. In addition to the search for a “good” redox material, not
only the overall feasibility but the commercialisation perspective
of a solar-driven fuels production process has to be demonstrated.
The high temperature levels required for the process (160 0–190 0 K)
and the effort s and cost s associated with their achievement, bring
the concept of the overall cycle process efficiency into play, as a sine
qua non requirement for commercial viability. Thus, before describ-
ing the various solar reactor types employed so far in more detail
with schematics, photographs and comments, it is deemed neces-
sary to insert a section on efficiency here, which will elucidate the
rationale according to which such specific reactor concepts have
been proposed and developed.

3.4. System efficiency

Various definitions of efficiency have been proposed, depend-
ing on the scale considered, i.e. the entire solar plant or only the
solar receiver/thermochemical reactor unit. To begin with the lat-
ter, the respective solar conversion efficiency is defined as the ra-
tio of the highest amount of work that could be possibly extracted
from the chemical products ( − (cid:3)G ) at room temperature (298 K) to
the overall solar energy input Q
solar , i.e. the amount of energy that
must be supplied to the solar reactor in order to carry out the en-
tire cycle. For convenience, the parameter − (cid:3)G is usually replaced
by the high heating value (HHV) of the fuel, giving

η

solar −to −fuel =

n CO / H 2 H H V CO / H 2
solar

Q

(6)

This quantity is calculated over the time that the reactor oper-

ates during the complete cycle, thus actually:

η

solar −to −fuel =

(cid:2)

H H V CO / H 2  ·
(cid:2)
 ̇ Q

solar dt

r CO / H 2 dt

(7)

2  is the molar fuel production rate, and   ̇ Q
where r CO / H
solar  is the
incident  solar  power  to  the  system  during  a  complete  cycle,  i.e.
during both steps. By definition of the HHV, the here-mentioned
equations are valid only if the heat released by combustion of the
fuel can be used entirely, including re-condensation of steam as a
combustion product in the case of hydrogen as a fuel.

Obviously, this definition does not take the entire solar plant
into account involving collection and concentration of the solar ra-
diation upon the receiver/reactor and the respective collection ef-
ficiency, i.e. the ratio of heat supplied to the thermochemical re-
actor to the available solar resource [86] . The collection loss refers
to the energy losses in the process of converting solar irradiation

into thermal energy involved in the thermochemical cycles. For the
concentration process, the initially available solar irradiation at the
solar collector may not be completely delivered to the receiver. The
associated losses (mainly operational losses and optical losses) and
efficiencies are closely related to both the solar resource availabil-
ity and the details of the reflectors and collectors (primary con-
centrator/heliostat reflectivity, secondary collector reflectivity, type,
configurations, size, material etc.). They are independent of the re-
dox reactions and could be considered by introducing a constant
efficiency  parameter  indicating  the  percentage  of  the  total  solar
energy delivered to the solar receiver [86,87] . Indicatively, this effi-
ciency was suggested to be ∼70% considering a parabolic dish col-
lector located in an area with excellent solar resource (Daggett, CA.
U.S.A.) [86,87] , whereas for a tower collector this efficiency would
be slightly lower.

From  this  definition,  it  is  clear  that  the  thermochemical  en-
ergy conversion efficiency essentially defines the size of the solar
concentrator: a more efficient solar reactor will require a smaller
power input to produce the same amount of fuel. This in turn, af-
fects directly the heliostat field, currently representing the largest
cost item for CSP tower plants (and believed to do so also for so-
lar fuels production tower plants) [88] . The economics of solar fuel
production are therefore crucially dependent on the thermochemi-
cal energy conversion efficiency.

Before elaborating quantitatively on the factors that contribute
and determine the efficiency, let us discuss the qualitative aspects
of this definition in the framework described so far. The “materials-
related” problem in this respect is the low extent of thermal re-
duction  and the consequently lower amount  of fuel that can be
produced (numerator of Eq. (6) ). However, the denominator is re-
lated to the conditions of the actual solar-aided operation. In real
operating  systems,  the  solar  energy  input  on  the  one  hand  suf-
fers from various energy losses during the heat transfer processes
taking place and on the other hand has also to compensate any
energy consumption of the auxiliary systems required, facts that
lower the actual system efficiency.

Given the temperature levels required, it is evident that in order
to achieve reasonable efficiencies, on the one hand the solar reac-
tor has to incorporate as much of the redox oxide solid reactant as
possible not only to maximize volumetric product yield (numer-
ator) but also to avoid the “waste” of external energy in heating
chemically-inert materials to high temperatures (denominator). It
should be kept in mind that in the case of non-stoichiometric re-
dox oxides, not only the support structures and the reactor cham-
ber are considered inert thermal mass, but even most of the redox
material itself, since only a small amount of the atoms in the lat-
tice takes part in the actual O-vacancy formation mechanism. This
is the reason why the sensible energy required to heat the reac-
tor typically significantly exceeds the heat demand of the actual
chemical reaction.

On the other hand, the sensible heat available after the higher-
temperature TR step cannot be simply rejected. On the contrary,
it has somehow to be recovered and reused effectively; otherwise
the relevant heat losses will render the process/system efficiency
prohibitively  low  for  any  commercial  exploitation.  At  this  stage
the problem shifts from chemistry issues discussed so far to heat
transfer ones and the solar reactor type and its potential for heat
recuperation become important. In fact, the various reactor designs
proposed for the particular application have stemmed to a large
degree  from  the  quest  for  effective  heat  recuperation  concepts,
since heat recovery is one of the main challenges to be addressed
before commercialization of such thermochemical redox cycles is
economically viable.

In this framework, the first factor that comes immediately into
play is that identifying optimum redox material chemistries is not
enough per se, but, should such materials exist, they have to be

suitably incorporated into efficient, scalable, solar reactors, render-
ing the concept of solar energy-driven production of fuels via two-
step redox cycles promising enough for eventual commercial de-
ployment.  For  example,  thermodynamic  calculations  can  identify
redox oxide compositions capable of high chemical reaction extent
but the temperature and pressure conditions needed for that to be
on the edge (or even beyond) of being feasible and practical, or re-
quiring non-attainable reactor operation modes. The intricacies of
actual solar implementation of the volatile cycles and how these
eventually halted their effective realization in solar reactors have
been already discussed. Quoting from [89]

“... As new materials are developed, it is important to establish a
framework for evaluating the extent to which such materials can
actually improve the  system  level non-stoichiometric  redox cycle
efficiency...by simultaneous consideration of oxygen storage ma-
terial properties and operating conditions of the thermochemical
two-step redox. Such a framework is needed because one cannot
define a figure of merit or assess an oxygen storage material’s ef-
ficiency solely from its material properties, without describing the
reactor in which it is used. Thus, it becomes difficult to determine
if a given oxygen storage material has the ability to enable higher
system efficiencies than another, without also considering the re-
actors...”. A most recent study [ 38 ] is even more emphatic: “...Be-
cause both reactions (authors’ note: reduction and oxidation) can-
not be favored at once, analysis of the usefulness of an active ma-
terial should not simply be based on the quantity of H 2 /CO it is ca-
pable of generating after reduction at high temperatures and oxi-
dation under high excesses of H 2 O/CO 2 at low temperatures. Rather
the active material should be judged based on its η
solar-to-fuel .. Ad-
ditionally, the effectiveness of the plant, i.e. the solar delivery sys-
tem and heat recuperation, has a large impact on overall perfor-
mance. The redox material behavior dictates the requirements of
the solar plant. This means that the system needs to be designed
around the material...”.

Several techno-economic analysis studies have been performed
to  identify  the  performance  levels  required  to  induce  commer-
cial viability of such redox-based solar fuels/hydrogen production
routes  [71,87,90] .  The  most  often  quoted  and  believed  metric  is
that thermochemical routes to solar fuels must demonstrate a “sys-
tem level annual average solar to fuel efficiency” in excess of 20%
- with the “system” here including the entire solar plant - to be
considered a viable alternative vs. more conventional approaches
like electrolysis; according to the same study this translates to a
solar  reactor  thermochemical  efficiency  as  defined  in  Eq.  (6)  of
not less than 36% [87] . In parallel, U.S.A.’s Department of Energy
(DOE) Multi-Year Research, Development, and Demonstration Plan
(MYRD&D) set the technical target for Hydrogen production from
thermochemical water splitting as a “Solar to hydrogen (STH) en-
ergy conversion ratio” of 20 for year 2020 [91] . Even though this
solar-to-fuel efficiency metric does not explicitly include cost, the
above  framework  has  essentially  led,  as  quoted  verbatim  from
[92] to its use

“...as a surrogate to economics to project the commercial via-
bility of thermochemical metal redox cycles because reactors to
implement these cycles are still early in the research and devel-
opment phase..”.

Given such targets, an intensive effort has been undertaken in
identifying by thermodynamic means, conditions and reactor oper-
ating modes that maximize this solar-to-fuel conversion efficiency.
For the two-step thermochemical H
2 splitting cycle, the the-
oretical efficiency of the system under different reaction conditions
can be obtained by combining the thermodynamic data of the re-
dox material (numerator) with rational assumptions and estima-
tions on the energy consuming terms during solar operation (de-

factors relevant to the redox material, proceeding then to those af-
fecting the solar reactor/process.

eventual scalability to ready-for-demonstration solar reactor con-
cepts remaining as yet “on the drawing board” [80] and having to
be materialized.

3.5. Current development status of ceria vs. other redox pair-based
oxides

The choice of a redox material should be therefore considered
within  this  context  and  perspective  of  the  overall  solar  thermo-
chemical fuels production process value chain: from fundamental
thermodynamic calculations to the eventual developing, building,
operating  and  testing  redox-oxide-based  solar  reactors  in  pilot-
scale  level  to  demonstrate  the  technology  potential  for  further
commercial deployment. Among the four non-stoichiometric ma-
terial  families  mentioned  so  far,  ceria  (CeO
2- δ)  has  been  widely
and  for  long-term  used  in  similar  redox-based  applications,  the
most prominent being oxygen storage in automotive exhaust after-
treatment; therein it performs cyclic, reversible transfer of oxygen
to the catalyst, based on oxygen uptake/ release between oxida-
tive (oxygen–rich)/reductive (oxygen-lean) atmosphere conditions,
respectively [93] . Hence, there exists an abundance of thermody-
namic data for the ceria system in such applications in contrast
e.g.  to  multi-cation  combinations  of  ferrites  where  research  and
industrial exploitation is focused so far rather on their magnetic
properties. Partially due to this plethora of thermodynamic data,
the efficiency of the ceria cycle has been assessed extensively cor-
relating the extent of reduction characterized by the oxygen non-
stoichiometry δ,  the  enthalpy  and  entropy  changes  ( (cid:3)H, (cid:3)S)  of
the cycle reactions with the reduction operation conditions, tem-
perature, oxygen partial pressure ( T ,  p O
2 ) and optimum tempera-
ture/pressure swing [94,95] ; in fact ceria is one of the few redox
oxides where the off-stoichiometry δ, (cid:3)H and (cid:3)S have been de-
termined for a wide range of applicable conditions.

2 /CeO

Lattice cerium ions in ceria can be partially reduced from Ce 4 +
to Ce 3 + without major changes in its lattice structure [96,97] . De-
spite  its  relative  low  fuel  productivity  (for  example,  0.58 mol/kg
1.9  change),  the  non-stoichiometric  WS/CDS  ceria
for  a  CeO
cycle  shows  unique  qualities,  namely  excellent  stability  and  fast
splitting  kinetics.  Furthermore,  ceria  has  a  much  higher  melting
point (2670 K) than iron oxides, which makes it very stable dur-
ing high-temperature processes and more robust against possible
melting under temperature “overshooting” during real solar irra-
diation conditions. Ceria can be also shaped into monolithic struc-
tures like fins, foams and membranes which, due to this high melt-
ing  point,  can  be  sintered  at  temperatures  high  enough  to  ac-
quire  satisfactory  mechanical  rigidity  and  therefore  incorporated
and tested in larger-scale demonstration reactors.

These qualities have rendered ceria a benchmark material for
this technology, widely used for thermodynamic analysis and re-
actor testing which are of great significance for the implementa-
tion of the technology [98,99] . The two-step thermochemical cycle
performed with cerium-based oxides has been widely studied and
closely followed by almost all the relevant research groups in the
world  since  ceria  was  proposed  for  this  application.  It  has  been
thus employed in most reactor concepts eventually scaled up and
tested under real solar irradiation environment. Among the redox
oxides,  so  far,  only  iron-  and  ceria-based  redox  pairs  have  been
demonstrated on pilot scale, and only ceria has shown excellent
stability of both structure and fuel productivity in long-term tests
of  hundreds  of  cycles  [4,98] .  The  “newer” material  families  ex-
plored, perovskites and hercynites, despite initial encouraging re-
sults reported with respect to yield and experimental conditions
required, on the one hand are still questioned on thermodynamic
grounds in terms of their eventual solar-to-fuel efficiency (as will
be reported in more detail below) and on the other hand are so
far tested only under small-scale laboratory conditions, with their

Thus  it  can  be  summarized  that  in  the  overall  solar  thermo-
chemical fuels process value chain, ceria remains today not nec-
essarily  the  theoretically  superior,  but  the  most  pragmatic  solu-
tion, in that it has been extensively studied theoretically, proven
to work experimentally and has been suitable to demonstrate the
feasibility of the cycle and key process components such as solar
reactors. In expectation to deepen our understanding and advance
the  research  in  the  field,  a  review  of  the  advancements  on  the
specific topic is presented in this work, emphasizing the develop-
ments having taken place during the last decade. Research progress
is summarized and discussed from the aspects of reaction princi-
ples, material modifications, reaction kinetics and, finally, solar re-
actors. Examples and figures of merit from the literature for ceria
are reported and compared to those of other redox systems, where
possible. The current development status of technology is analyzed
and assessed and the future prospects and promising research di-
rections to overcome the technical barriers identified, especially in
relevance  to  recent  findings  with  respect  to  alternative  material
classes and potentially associated reactor concepts, are discussed
in the final section.

4. Basic principles of the ceria thermochemical cycle

4.1. Defect chemistry

As already mentioned, the partial reduction mechanism of ce-
ria is exploited for WS/CDS. This mechanism involves the forma-
tion of oxygen vacancies, one kind of point lattice defects, thus a
brief introduction of defect equilibrium is presented below to fa-
cilitate understanding the reaction principles. As shown in Fig. 2 a,
ceria (CeO
2 ) has a cubic fluorite structure with a face-centered cu-
bic (f.c.c.) unit cell. The coordination number of the cerium ions
is  8  and  of  the  oxygen  ions  is  4.  Under  high  temperatures  and
low oxygen partial pressures, ceria would release oxygen and Ce 4 +
could be partially reduced to Ce 3 +  and form a new stoichiomet-
ric oxide with lower cerium oxidation state, undergoing a phase
change.  However,  from  the  phase  diagram  ( Fig.  2 b  [60] )  it  be-
comes  apparent  that  above  922 K  ceria  could  maintain  a  disor-
dered fluorite structure ( α phase) in a large range of oxygen non-
stoichiometry.  The  transition  temperature  increases  as  the  oxy-
gen  non-stoichiometry  decreases  from  2.0  and  approaches  1.714
[60,100] .  Thus  the  maximum  fuel  productivity  of  ceria  without
phase change is 1.66 mol/kg (CeO

2 /CeO
A  lot  of  investigations  were  conducted  through  thermo-
gravimetric  analysis  [96,97,101,102] ,  coulometric  titrations  [103–
106] and conductivity measurements [107–118] to reveal the ther-
mochemical  and  electrochemical  properties  and  clarify  the  type
of  defects  and  their  behavior.  Single-ionized  oxygen  vacancies
[112] ,  doubly-ionized  oxygen  vacancies  [96]  and  cerium  intersti-
tials  [107,118]  were  proposed  to  be  the  major  defect  types.  Cur-
rently, it is widely accepted that the dominant defects are doubly-
ionized oxygen vacancies and that the reduced cerium ion can be
regarded as a polaron with an electron localized within it [96,119] .
In Kröger–Vink notation, the oxygen releasing (oxygen vacancy for-
mation) process can be expressed as [96,120] :

Fig. 3 shows the experimentally obtained dependence of oxy-
gen non- stoichiometry of ceria on temperature and oxygen partial
pressure [96,122,123] . The thermogravimetric measurements con-
ducted by Panlener et al. [96] covered a much wider temperature
(1023–1773 K) and oxygen pressure (10 −2 –10 −26 bar) range; hence
they are generally used as a reference for calculating the efficiency
of solar fuel production processes.

Based on the experimental results and their evaluation using a
van’t Hoff approach, different analytical models were proposed for

predicting/calculating the reduction extent under different ( T , p O
conditions (also plotted in Fig. 3 ). In Scheffe et al.’s study [120] ,
the oxygen non-stoichiometry was modeled by applying an ideal
solution model in conjunction with a defect interaction model. The
natural logarithm of equilibrium constants of both vacancy forma-
tion ( Eq. (7) ) and defect interaction reactions ( Eq. (8) ) were shown
to  have  a  reciprocal  temperature  dependence.  Thus,  the  oxygen
non-stoichiometry at high temperatures could be predicted by ex-
trapolation from equilibrium constants measured at low temper-
atures. An Arrhenius-based model was developed by Bulfin et al.
[124] , deduced based on the equilibrium between oxygen releasing

and absorbing reactions and expressed as:

introduced  between  the  two  steps  of  the  fuel  production  cycle,
based  on  the  defect  equilibrium  of  ceria  under  different  condi-
tions. Due to the lattice configuration change brought about by the
formation/re-filling of oxygen vacancies, the thermodynamic prop-
erties of ceria have a δ dependence. Thus the reactions involved
in the cycle could be better understood in terms of partial molar
quantities.

cluded that oxides with lower reduction enthalpy and higher re-
duction entropy are easier to reduce, which indicates a potential
for higher fuel productivity  as long as the reduced sites  are ca-
2  splitting  [126] .  Besides,  as  will  be  noted  be-
pable  of  H

splitting  requires  the  reduction  enthalpy  to  be  higher  than  the
enthalpy  of  direct  water  splitting  (thermolysis).  These  two  rules
provide  a  thermodynamic  criterion  for  materials  screening  and
modification.  Specifically,  for  ceria  it  was  recently  demonstrated
that its high reduction entropy change ( ∼200 J (cid:2)mol −1 (cid:2)K −1 ) asso-
ciated with the unique electronic structure of cerium contributes
substantially to its excellent performance for high-temperature re-
dox reactions [127] . The high reduction entropy is mainly from the
ion configurational entropy due to the formation of oxygen vacan-
cies and onsite electronic configurational entropy arising from or-
bital splitting caused by spin-orbit coupling and the cubic crystal
field of ceria [127] . On the other hand, the reduction enthalpy of
ceria ( ∼475 kJ (cid:2)mol −1 ) is higher than that of most of the alternative
oxides aimed for fuel production [36] . This can be a driving force
of the oxidation reaction, but will prevent the material from being
reduced strongly under moderate reduction temperatures, leading
to a low productivity [36] .

From the aspect of reaction conditions, reduction is more fa-
vored  at  high  temperatures  and  low  oxygen  partial  pressures.
Therefore, creating a low-oxygen partial pressure atmosphere with
low energy consumption and economic cost becomes a significant
research focus of system design and optimization. This could also
be understood from the Ellingham diagrams of ceria with differ-
ent compositions ( Fig. 4 ). Partial reduction enthalpy and entropy
are obtained from thermogravimetric analysis [96] . For each com-
position of ceria, the (cid:3)g δ = 0 point corresponds to the equilibrium
temperature under a certain oxygen pressure. Taking the compo-
1.99 as an example, when the oxygen partial pressure is
sition CeO
10 −5 bar, CeO
1.99 would remain unchanged at 1577 K, but it will be
further reduced to CeO
1.95 if the temperature increases to 1733 K.
From another aspect, it could remain stable at a lower temperature
if the oxygen pressure is reduced to 10 −10 bar.

Similarly, the oxidation step could be written as:

increases. In this case, a great deal of extra water vapor is needed
to drive the oxidation.

higher dissociation extent due to its thermodynamic properties, or,
to be more accurate, the different temperature- dependence of the
redox enthalpies and entropies [129] .

Since reduction is more favored as the temperature increases,
in the early studies in the field, the oxidation step was conceived
to be performed at considerably lower temperatures and for quite
a  long  time  temperature  swings  were  considered  necessary  in
two-step cycles. Relevant studies were mostly committed to seek-
ing a higher productivity at a lower temperature. To evade prob-
lems with such temperature-swing operation, the so-called isother-
mal  thermochemical  cycles  in  which  T ox = T
red  have  been  pro-
posed; firstly discussed in conjunction with hercynites and soon
afterwards theoretically and experimentally investigated with ce-
ria [77,130–132] . Isothermal cycles of ceria can also be easily un-
derstood from Fig. 5 . At 1673 K, ceria could be reduced to CeO
1.95
2 is 10 −6 bar, and at the same temperature, it could be ox-
when p O
idized to CeO
2 . Obviously, since only
the difference in oxygen pressure is used as the driving force, the
non-stoichiometry difference in an isothermal cycle would in most
cases be lower than that in non-isothermal ones, leading in princi-
ple, to lower fuel productivities. Isothermal cycles will be discussed
further in comparison to non-isothermal ones in the next sections,
having described the solar reactors conceived and tested for their
implementation.

5. Material modification

As mentioned above, the high reduction enthalpy of pure ceria
leads to a low reduction extent. The improvement of the reduc-
tion extent under certain conditions can reduce the amount of re-
dox material used per unit of fuel produced and is also often con-
sidered to enhance the energy efficiency of the system. This last
hypothesis looks at first sight reasonable; however the reduction
extent by itself is not sufficient if not adequately exploited during
the subsequent oxidation/fuel production step and in fact the ac-
tual situation is that materials with improved reducibility do not
necessarily improve the process efficiency [36] . The benefits of en-
hanced reduction should be sometimes compensated in the oxida-
tion step where one must heat excess steam/carbon dioxide due to
the thermodynamic constraints of the process. Unfortunately, im-
proved reduction is easily mistaken for better performance without
fully considering the fuel conversion ratio during oxidation. Never-
theless, research efforts for a long time have taken the approach of
searching for oxides that are more easily reduced either to a higher
extent or at lower temperatures.

Doping, i.e. the exchange of metal cations by other species in a
small amount, was generally considered as an effective method to
improve the reduction extent or reduce the reduction temperature.
Many dopants were studied with varying degree of success. Both
valence  and  ionic  radius  were  supposed  to  be  important  factors
determining the performance of the doped compounds [133–135] .
For simplicity, the different dopants are summarized here based on
their valence ( Table 1 ).

In general, dopant ions with valences lower than that of Ce 4 +
seem not to be a favorable option. The reduction extent may be
slightly enhanced at relatively low reduction temperatures [143] ,
due to defect interaction and ordering which lower the reduction
enthalpy [153–155] and trigger the oxygen releasing reaction at a
lower temperature compared to pure ceria. However, the enhance-
ment effect of doping diminishes as the materials are further re-
duced, a fact attributed to the introduction of inert oxygen vacan-
cies. According to the principle of electric neutrality, dopant ions in
a lower state will result in a large number of oxygen vacancies in
the lattice. This could promote bulk oxygen diffusion since the lat-
tice oxygen diffuses through oxygen vacancies, thus could be ben-
eficial to reaction kinetics. However, the effect on reduction extent
may be limited or even negative from the view of reaction equilib-
rium of Eq. (8) . Meng et al. [142] studied the H
2 O splitting prop-
erty of 2.5–10% Li doped ceria oxides considering that Li + has both
a small radius and a low valence. The productivity first increased,
and then decreased as the doping concentration increased; 2.5% Li-
doped ceria exhibited the highest reactivity in H
2 -generation re-
action. However, the advantage of Li doped ceria over pure ceria
was not verified since the cycling performance of pure ceria was
not included in comparison. Most bivalent and trivalent cations re-
viewed here seem to have no or negligible promoting effect on Ce
redox reactions [133,135,137,140,144,145] a fact consistent with the
thermodynamic analysis based on oxygen non-stoichiometry mea-
surements [120] . The results of Sc doping are inconsistent among
different studies. Tada et al. [133] evaluated 10% Sc-doped ceria in
a thermochemical water splitting cycle and found that the Ce re-
dox  performance  could  be  enhanced  by  Sc  doping.  This  was  at-
tributed to the fact that, with a smaller ionic radius, the presence
of Sc 3 +  could mitigate the volumetric expansion caused by Ce 3 +
formation  (the  ionic radius  of  Ce 3 +  is  larger than  that  of  Ce 4 + ).
The reactivity of Sc-doped ceria for two-step water splitting was
further studied by Lee et al. [134] . CeO
3 solid solutions with
Sc content varying between 0 and 20% were synthesized and eval-
0.03 O

uated  in  two-step  water  splitting cycles.  Ce
2 -generation
ated the largest amount of O
2 . Its estimated H
rate  was  almost  seven  times  greater  than  that  of  Ce
2 .
0.89 Zr
This  high  performance  was  attributed  to  lattice  disorder  caused
by  the  lower  ionic  radius  of  Sc 3 +  and  oxygen  vacancies  formed
due  to  its  + 3  state.  However,  no  beneficial  effect  on  the  reduc-
tion  extent  by  doping  with  Sc  was  observed  by  Scheffe  et  al.
[145] .

In addition to modifying the redox properties of Ce ions, redox
reactions involving a change in oxidation state were also observed
for some of the cations introduced by doping. However, this also
seems to have no or very limited promoting effect on the overall
reduction of the doped oxide. Kaneko et al. studied the reactivity

However, the reduced cations could not decompose H
2 O in the ox-
idation step. The reduction reactions of Mn and Fe dopants in ceria
were also observed by Abanades et al., however, without enhance-
ment of the overall reduction extent [144] . For Fe doping, Ce 4 + re-
duction was stated to be enhanced by the presence of Fe 3 + -Fe 2 + ,
but interestingly, the amount of O
2 was observed to be in-
dependent of Fe concentration in the range of 0–30% [148] . Simi-
larly, Ce 4 + reduction was also indicated to be enhanced by Ni dop-
ing for the presence of Ni 2 + –Ni 0 . The optimum doping concentra-
tion in the range 2.5–30% was identified as 5% [140] , but its superi-
ority over pure ceria is doubtful considering the low H
2 productiv-
ity of doped samples and that the performance of pure ceria was
not included in the comparison. Meng et al. studied the feasibil-

ity of Pr-doped ceria for H
Pr 3 + in the first reduction step but it could not be oxidized by H
2 O.
The reactivity of Ce
2- δ was found to be related to both Pr
content and reaction temperature. 10% Pr-doped ceria was shown
to be preferable. A redox reaction of the dopant cation was also re-
ported for Cr-doped ceria, Ce
2.11 , in which reversible oxy-
gen release and water dissociation could be realized due to its flu-
orite structure and coupling between Ce 4 + /Ce 3 + and Cr 4 + /6 + /Cr 3 +
redox  couples  [151] .  Compared  to  pure  ceria  and  other  cerium-
based oxides, its reduction and oxidation temperatures, (738 K and
338 K), were surprisingly low. However, no following research was
reported and our experiments showed that Cr-doped ceria synthe-
2 splitting
sized through combustion method is not capable of CO
at such low temperatures.

Jacot et al. performed a comprehensive screening of all dopants
in the periodic table which have been reported to exhibit tetrava-
lent state. Si, Ti, V, Cr, Zr, Nb, Rh, Hf, Nb, V, Pr, and Tb at a dop-
ing concentration of 10% and Ta at 7% were tested in CO
2  split-
ting cycles; among them the Hf, Zr, and Ta doped samples showed
higher fuel productivity than that of pure ceria [156] . After that,
the long-term stability of Zr, Hf, Ta and Nb doped ceria was eval-
uated [157] . The fuel productivity of 10% Hf, 10% Zr, and 5% Nb + 5
doped ceria remained stable throughout 50 consecutive cycles, but
inhomogeneities occurred in the 7% Ta doped ceria and the CO pro-
ductivity decreased significantly with increasing number of cycles.
Similarly, in Abanades et al.’s study, it was reported that introduc-
tion of a limited amount of Ta could improve the redox properties
compared to pure ceria. However, a stable phase of CeTaO
4  was
formed in the high-temperature reduction step as the doping con-
centration of Ta increased, which hindered the water dissociation
reaction [137] .

exhibited the highest reactivity among the oxides tested. In Scheffe
et al.’s work [145] , the reduction extent of Zr and Hf doped ce-
ria was found to be substantially higher than that of pure and S c
doped ceria. Furthermore, in the investigated doping range, 0–15%,
the reduction extent of both Zr and Hf doped ceria increased with
doping concentration. Le Gal et al. investigated the influence of Zr
content  between 10% and 50%  on the  redox  properties of Ce–Zr
solid solutions in water-splitting cycles. The reduction extent in-
creased with increasing Zr content. However, an increase in Zr con-
tent also led to significant deactivation, thus moderate Zr contents
favoring H
2 production in repeated cycles without significant reac-
tivity loss were recommended [146] . Call et al. [159] and Hao et al.
[158] studied the thermodynamic properties of ceria–zirconia solid
solutions and concluded that introduction of Zr could increase the
H
2 productivity in both isothermal and non-isothermal cycles. The
improvement of reduction extent of Zr doped ceria was attributed
to the fact that Zr favors a 7-fold rather than an 8-fold coordina-
tion, rendering the oxygen close to Zr 4 + easier to be released [160] .
It should be noted that the doping studies listed above mainly
focus  on  obtaining the  redox  potential  of  test  materials  through
several,  yet  few  cycles  (usually  < 10).  Except  where  specifically
stated, the long-term stability of doped materials was not specif-
ically  studied.  However,  the  long-term  stability  evaluation  of
dopants  other  than  Zr  and  Hf  seems  to  be  unnecessary,  consid-
ering  that  they  exhibit  no  or  negligible  promotion  on  fuel  pro-
ductivity  and  the  stable  performance  of  pure  ceria  in  the  form
of either structured or granular materials in isothermal and non-
isothermal cycles has been verified in hundreds of consecutive cy-
cles [132,161] . For Zr and Hf doped ceria, the gas fuel yield in mul-
tiple cycles is very sensitive to their kinetic performance and the
reaction duration since both of them show an obvious drawback
in oxidation kinetics [136,144,145,158,159] . In a long-term cycling
2  suffered  from  linear  yield
of  more  than  80  cycles,  Ce
degradation, attributed to declining oxidation kinetics. The reduc-
tion and oxidation temperatures were 1673 K and 1173 K respec-
tively and the isothermal duration of both steps was 20 min [162] .
In contrast, in Jacot et al.’s experiments, 10% Zr and 10% Hf doped
ceria  synthesized  via  a  similar  process  maintained  a  stable  fuel

output during 50 cycles. The reduction and oxidation temperatures
were 1773 K and 1273 K respectively and the corresponding isother-
mal durations of the two steps were 90 min and 30 min [157] .

Thermodynamic  analysis  shows  that,  compared  to  pure  ceria,
both reduction enthalpy and entropy of Zr-doped ceria are signif-
icantly lower ( Fig. 6 ). The favorable effect of enthalpy overcomes
the  adverse  effect  of  entropy,  so  the  overall  reduction  extent  is
higher  than  that  of  pure  ceria.  However,  the  decrease  in  reduc-
tion  enthalpy  lowers  the  driving  force  of  the  oxidation  reaction,
leading  to  a  lower  conversion  extent  during  oxidation,  and  may
also  contribute  to  its  slow  oxidation  kinetics.  There  is  an  inher-
ent contradiction between "easy reduction" and "rapid oxidation"
since a lower reduction enthalpy favors reduction but not oxida-
tion. In order to further improve H
2 /CO production and/or amelio-
rate the kinetic drawback of Zr/Hf doped ceria, further doping of
cations with a lower valence in Ce–Zr/Hf solid solutions was stud-
ied. La, Gd, Mg, Ca, Sm and Pr were investigated due to their ben-
eficial effect on the material’s thermal resistance and introduction
of extrinsic oxygen vacancies, but with various degrees of success
[138,139,147,152,162] . For example, adding 2.5% Sm in Ce
0.15 O

did not lead to a higher productivity but did help to keep stable
yields and kinetics in more than 80 cycles [162] .

A  novel  doping  strategy,  namely  paired  charge-compensating
doping, was recently proposed. Trivalent and pentavalent cations
were doped simultaneously, thus no redundant oxygen vacancies
were created by doping. This seems to be an effective method to

balance the reduction and oxidation properties [163,164] , but the
robustness of lattice structure and the stability of fuel productivity
in multiple cycles still need to be further verified.

5.2. Morphological modification

Besides changing the composition of ceria by doping, morpho-
logical modifications by different synthesis processes were also in-
vestigated to enhance its performance in solar thermochemical cy-
cles.  Theoretically,  if  the  particle  size  is  small  enough,  the  sur-
face effect could lead to significant decline in reduction enthalpy
[165,166] . The efficiency could be improved in this way since the
energy cost for ceria reduction is reduced. In addition, materials
with a  high surface  area have more  reactive sites  and  a shorter
bulk diffusion length, leading to a high reaction rate. However, the
application of ceria in nano-scale structures with very high surface
area seems to be unrealistic because the eventual working tem-
perature ( ∼1773 K) is much higher than that of ordinary chemical
processes.

The CNRS group investigated the effects of different morpho-
logical and surface area characteristics of ceria-based powders ob-
tained via various synthesis routes, on the powders’ WS/CDS per-
formance.  A  Ce–Zr  solid  solution  synthesized  with  a  CTABr  sur-
factant was reported to have a BET specific surface area as high
as  169  m 2 /g,  but  obviously  measured  after  the  calcination  syn-
thesis  step  at  873 K.  Naturally,  the  reduction  yield  was  signifi-
cantly improved during the first cycle but material sintering during
the high-temperature process caused the H
2 /CO production to de-
crease markedly [146] . Le Gal et al. [136] compared the reactivity
of Zr
2 synthesized using different soft chemical synthe-
sis routes, including co-precipitation of hydroxides, hydrothermal
treatment, the Pechini method and the sol–gel route. The mate-
rial synthesized through the Pechini method produced the highest
amounts of CO/H
2 in successive cycles, which was attributed to its
better thermal resistance due to its porous structure favoring a sta-
ble kinetic performance.

The group at University of Minnesota, U.S.A. (UoM) synthesized
three-dimensionally  ordered  macroporous  structures,  so-called
3DOM ceria [167] , featuring a higher specific area (29.9 m 2 (cid:2)g −1 ), a
higher pore volume (0.20 m 3 (cid:2)g −1 ), and a lower grain size (14 nm)
compared to commercial ceria powder (1.0 m 2 (cid:2)g −1 ). Negligible dif-
ference in overall fuel production was observed for different sam-
ples in 6 consecutive isothermal cycles at 1098 K with H
2 - assisted
2 O  oxidation,  but  3DOM  ceria  showed
reduction  and  CO
obvious  advantages  in  both  H
2  and  CO  production  rates  (peak
production rate, 10.12 μmol (cid:2)g −1 (cid:2)s −1  and 27.31 μmol (cid:2)g −1 (cid:2)s −1  re-
spectively)  due  to  its  higher  specific  surface  area  (10.2  m 2 (cid:2)g −1
after  cycling)  and  interconnected  pore  system  which  enhanced
mass  transport  between  reacting  species  and  reacting  surface
[167] .  Ceria  powder  synthesized  via  thermal  decomposition  of
2 O with a specific surface area of 111.9 gm 2 (cid:2)g −1 was
Ce(NO
also  included  in  the  comparison.  However,  99%  of  the  surface
area  was  lost  in  the  first  reduction  step,  and  the  fuel  produc-
tion rates were just comparable to that of commercial ceria pow-
der. The same morphology was also found to be effective for Zr
2  splitting per-
doped ceria [168,169] . Rudisill et al. compared CO
formance of 3DOM ceria, non-ordered macroporous ceria, aggre-
gates of anisotropic nanoparticles and commercially obtained, non-
porous  ceria  in  55  cycles  with  the  thermal  reduction  step  con-
ducted  at  ∼1473 K  in  N
2  [170] .  3DOM  ceria  showed  the  fastest
CO production rate due to greater resistance to sintering than the
other morphologies, retaining an open, porous structure. However,
it should be noted that the above 3DOM tests were conducted ei-
ther with chemical reduction with a reductive agent (H
2 ) or with
thermal reduction at a relatively lower temperature ( ∼1473 K). The
thermal stability of 3DOM still needs to be further confirmed at

0.975 Zr

higher temperatures and at conditions relevant to its eventual ap-
plication.  An  electrospinning  process  was  also  proposed  recently
2 fibers
as a promising synthesis method [171] . The Ce
could maintain their structure with surface areas of 0.3 m 2 /g after
108 cycles with reduction at 1673 K. The surface area was stated
to be higher than those observed for other ceria-based structures
operating at similarly high temperature conditions [171] . Based on
the above findings, it could be reasonably inferred that the max-
imum  specific  surface  area  of  ceria  without  support  suitable  for
high-temperature ( > 1773 K) solar fuel production cycle would be
< 1 m 2 (cid:2)g −1 .

Along  these  lines,  the  UoM  group  also  studied  via  numerical
heat and mass transfer modeling the effect of morphology on ce-
ria non-stoichiometric thermal reduction driven by direct high-flux
solar irradiation in the presence of a sweeping gas flow through
a ceria porous structure. Porosity ( (cid:9)) and Sauter mean diameter,
which  is  defined  as  d 32 = 1 −(cid:9)
sf  is  the  specific  surface
area, were used to characterize the porous morphology of a reac-
tive ceria porous structure [172] . For each value of porosity, there
would be an optimal Sauter mean diameter balancing the benefit
from a high extinction coefficient and the penalty from low perme-
ability. With material morphology, heat and mass transfer (includ-
ing irradiation), and reaction kinetics included in consideration, the
model could also serve as an effective tool for reactor design and
optimization. The radiative properties of ceria in the spectral range
relevant to solar thermochemical processes were obtained from a
series of experimental measurements and theoretical analysis pre-
viously performed by the authors [173–177] .

Naturally such studies on morphology modifications have to be
closely coupled to the eventual form/shape/structure of the mate-
rial to be employed in the solar reactor, e.g. whether this would
be in the form of packed beds, flowing granules, or shaped into
monolithic structures. Therein, material morphological aspects like
(particles) shape, size and porosity affect also the heat and mass
transfer properties [178,179] . Furthermore, especially for directly ir-
radiated reactors, the radiative properties of the reactive solid ma-
terials, which are highly dependent on their structures, may have
a crucial impact on the material heating rate and the uniformity of
temperature distribution [180] . Thus, further such studies on the
morphology effects are discussed later, in conjunction to the rele-
vant reactor concepts in the respective sections.

6. Kinetics

In thermochemical cycles, the fuel productivity is determined
by  the  material  thermodynamics,  while  the  reaction  rate  is  de-
termined by the reaction kinetics. The kinetic performance of the
reactive material is of crucial importance for the practical imple-
mentation  of  thermochemical  production  of  solar  fuels.  On  the
one hand, the models describing the reaction process can be used
for modeling the transport processes and chemical reaction in the
reactor,  so  as  to  assist  the  reactor  design  and  optimization.  On
the other hand, clarifying the reaction mechanisms and the rate-
limiting step is of guiding significance to further optimize the ma-
terial from the aspects of composition and surface modification in
order to obtain more efficient gas–solid interaction.

With the materials operating via the partial reduction mecha-
nism (irrespective of them being ceria, ferrites or perovskites) both
reduction and oxidation processes involve an overall gas–solid re-
action which consists of coupled steps of surface reaction and oxy-
gen diffusion in the bulk of the solid particle (grain). The core un-
derlying concept, as depicted in Fig. 7 a from Zhao et al. [181] and
described in detail in [182–184] is that the redox material consists
of two distinct regions: the outer region (surface) which is in con-
tact with the gas phase and where the chemical reactions occur
(this region includes the pore structure that is filled with gas) and

the inner region (bulk material) where the gas phase has no di-
rect access. Starting from the oxidation step, the gas–solid inter-
face is where the water/carbon dioxide molecules are converted to
hydrogen/carbon monoxide by delivering oxygen to the solid lat-
tice. Oxygen then has to diffuse through the oxide bulk via a pro-
cess governed by ambipolar diffusion, a diffusion of both negative
and positive charge carriers to retain charge neutrality. During re-
duction the direction of the oxygen motion is reversed and again
diffusion  in  the  bulk  and  surface  reaction  determine  the  overall
reaction  characteristics.  In  the  broader  reactor  context  ( Fig.  7 b),
each solid particle (or grain) can be visualized as part of an en-
semble of particles either loosely packed in a powder bed (station-
ary/moving/fluidized) or within a shaped porous structure, as will
be described in detail later [185] . This is the level where gas phase
transport comes also into play and hence the reactor design and

characteristics affect the mass and heat transfer between the solid
and the gaseous components of the reactions.

Returning to the single-particle level, the overall rate depends
on the slower, i.e. the rate-limiting step between surface reaction
and oxygen bulk diffusion. In principle, either step could be rate-
limiting, depending on the reaction conditions (temperature and
gas  atmosphere)  and  morphological  characteristics  of  the  mate-
rial. So far there have been many studies on kinetics, which re-
vealed  several  important  kinetic  characteristics  of  the  redox  re-
actions.  However,  due  to  differences  in  material  microstructure,
model selection and limitations of experimental equipment, there
are still some inconsistencies or even conflicts on the kinetic pa-
rameters.

There are two basic approaches for the derivation of rate ex-
pressions of water/carbon dioxide splitting and the corresponding

18

thermal  reduction  reactions.  The  first  approach  is  based  on  the
consideration of kinetic expressions from works conducted in the
field of solid phase reactions [186,187] . The expressions are fitted
to  the  experimental  rate-conversion  curves  to  find  the  optimum
expression  and  subsequently  the  mechanism  that  dominates  the
reaction rate. The disadvantage in this case is that the solid state
reaction mechanisms proposed (like the shrinking core [188] or the
simple constant radial retraction rate [146] models) do not suffice
to describe/fit the full evolution of the gaseous products concen-
tration profiles (oxygen and hydrogen/carbon monoxide during re-
duction and oxidation respectively) as these are recorded during
the full course of the reaction(s).These approaches are described
in more detail in Section 6.1 . The evolution of the product gases
during the two reactions is of inherently transient nature and gov-
erned  by  non-equilibrated  surface  and  bulk  processes  that  com-
mence  upon  reaching a  critical  temperature (reduction)  or  upon
exposure to the oxidant (oxidation). Thus, the other approach is
to use phenomenological models based on the actual shape of the
temporal gas species (hydrogen/carbon monoxide, oxygen) concen-
tration evolution profiles. All such gas evolution profiles are char-
acterized by a sharp increase in the gas species concentration that
peaks at relatively short times and is followed by a gradual decline
where very long times are needed for it to reach practically zero
level. This behavior reflects the rate-governing mechanisms in the
material, namely surface reactions and bulk diffusion of reactive
intermediates, within naturally, the limitations of the experimental
apparatus like detection lag and diffusion. Parameterized models
can be formulated to describe this behavior and the crucial param-
eters can be calculated by iteration until the models are capable to
fit the experimental gas species concentration profiles to the max-
imum possible degree and, most importantly, to describe the gas
concentration evolution for the entire duration of the reactions. Ki-
netic constants derived via this approach from minimal number of
experiments in suitable reactors, at different experimental condi-
tions (i.e. gas species concentrations and dwell temperatures), do
not necessarily hold physical meaning but on the other hand do
allow for the simulation of the reactions and the design and sim-
ulation of solar thermochemical reactors with adequate accuracy
[184] . This approach has been applied for ferrites by the Aerosol
and Particle Technology (APTL) group, Thessaloniki, Greece, [182–
184] as well as by the SANDIA/UoC groups [190] and for ceria by
the UoC group [191] . It is interesting to note here the differences
reported between materials as well as gaseous reactants. The most
interesting trend for the ferrites, is that many research groups ad-
vocate that their (independent) results cannot be described by a
single  rate-governing  process  throughout  the  duration  of  an  ex-
periment.  In  order  to  explain  this  behavior,  the  participation  in
the  reactions  of  perhaps  more  than  one  ‘‘population’’  of  oxygen
storage sites [183] or iron ions [190] as these are evolving, have
been  suggested.  For  the  ceria  case,  Arifin  and  Weimer  [191]  re-
ported that whereas a first-order deceleratory mechanism of the
form f ( α) = (1 − α) was capable of describing the WS kinetics on
undoped ceria for their entire experimental observations at vari-
ous temperatures, this was not the case for CDS; convergence of a
single kinetic model adequately predicting the CO production be-
havior over the entire temperature range was not possible.

6.1. Apparent kinetic analysis

Some  apparent  kinetic  studies  were  conducted  on  both  re-
duction  and  oxidation  reactions.  The  whole  or  partial  process
of  the  reaction(s)  was  fitted  with  specific  solid  reaction  models
[186,187] to obtain the apparent kinetic parameters and reveal the
controlling regime of the reaction. The reaction conditions, activa-
tion energies, and fitting models from different works are summa-
rized in Table 2 .

Different models were proposed to describe the reduction pro-
cess.  Ishida  et  al.  [192]  examined  various  theoretical  models  to
fit  the  experimental  results  of  thermogravimetric  analysis  with
the  master-plot  method  and  found  that  the  first-order  model
( f ( α) = 1 − α) showed the best fit. Le Gal et al. [146] analyzed the
thermogravimetric results of 25% Zr-doped ceria and suggested a
2
constant  radial  retraction  rate  model  ( f (α) = ( 1 − α)
3 ).  It  is  in-
teresting  that  a  shift  of  the  reaction  mechanism  from  second-
order reaction to a contracting-area reaction during heat-up was
reported,  attributed  to  sintering  and  decrease  of  lattice  oxygen.
Also, the activation energy of Li-doped ceria was found to be much
lower  than  those  of  pure  ceria  and  Zr-doped  ceria.  Bulfin  et  al.
[124] developed an Arrhenius-based model considering both oxy-
gen  releasing and  absorbing  reactions  in  oxygen  atmosphere.  By
combining it with a shrinking particle model in which the surface
reaction is the rate-limiting step, both reduction and oxidation pro-
cesses in oxygen could be well predicted.

The successful application of different models indicates that the
reaction  process  may  be  more  influenced  by  reaction  conditions
than  the  intrinsic  kinetic  properties  of  the  material.  Specifically,
the reduction reaction was observed to be mainly limited by heat-
ing rate and gas mass transfer in the experimental apparatus. For
the commonly used reaction devices such as thermobalances (ther-
mogravimetric  analysis,  TGA)  or  electric  furnaces,  the  maximum
heating rate is below 50 K (cid:2)min −1 and reduction usually takes much
longer than oxidation. The samples are supposed to be in equilib-
rium with the temperature and gas atmosphere. This could be con-
firmed by the observation of Ackermann et al. [193] , that a relative
large, dense sample (cylinder, R = 3.1 mm, L = 3.5 mm) was in equi-
librium during reduction and oxidation in TGA. The reaction rate
could become much faster in an environment optimized with re-
spect to heat and mass transfer. Chueh et al. [161] compared the
redox reaction in a small-scale infrared imaging furnace with an
average heating rate of 1700 K (cid:2)min −1 to that in a solar reactor with
an average heating rate of 140 K (cid:2)min −1  and observed ∼80 times
faster reduction in the former case. Bulfin et al. [194] built a vac-
uum reactor with a heating rate in excess of 100 K (cid:2)s −1 . A pressure
gradient was used as the driving force for gas diffusion, so the gas
transfer was much faster. Ceria and Zr-doped ceria were tested in
order to reveal the difference in kinetics of pure and doped sam-
ples, but the reduction process was so fast that it was still shown
to be limited by the heating rate and no difference was detected
among different samples [194] . Based on the above findings, in the
absence of relevant kinetic parameters, the rate constant was set
to be large enough to ensure the controlling effect of the transport
processes in modeling the coupled oxygen-releasing and heat and
mass transfer in porous ceria in Keene et al.’s study [172] .

The  oxidation  reaction  was  widely  suggested  to  be  lim-
ited  by  the  surface  reaction  rather  than  the  bulk  oxygen  dif-
fusion.  Ackermann  et  al.  [195]  studied  the  kinetics  of  ceria
2  over  a  wide  range  of  non-stoichiometries
oxidation  with  CO
(0.02 ≤ δ ≤ 0.25), temperatures (693 ≤ T ≤ 1273 K) and CO
2 con-
centrations (0.005 ≤ p C O
≤ 0.4 bar). They reported that the ox-
2
idation  rates  were  not  only  dependent  on  temperature  and  CO
2
concentration but also on reduction extent and surface morphol-
ogy.  For  reduction  extent  δ >  0.2,  the  oxidation  rates  slowed
down  due  to  phase  transition.  Even  though  the  overall  oxygen
non-stoichiometry (0.2) is actually lower than the phase transition
boundary, the surface in contact with CO
2  may be reduced to a
degree greater than the phase transition boundary and the sam-
ples were not fully equilibrated [195] . The oxidation rates increase
almost  linearly  with  oxygen  non-stoichiometry  when  δ <  0.06,
a  phenomenon  attributed  to  defect  interaction  and  morphologic
change  due  to  lattice  expansion.  Le  Gal  et  al.  [136]  compared
the  kinetic  properties  of  ceria  and  25%  Zr-doped  ceria  powders

synthesized  via  different  methods.  The  rate-limiting  mechanism
was identified by comparing the normalized rate data in differen-
tial  form  to  the  theoretical  functions  of  solid-state  kinetic  mod-
els. A surface mechanism described by the second order reaction
model was suggested for pure ceria while for 25% Zr-doped ceria,
a  diffusion-limited  regime  was  suggested.  However,  according  to
the experiments and analysis of Bulfin et al. [194] , the slow rate of
Zr-doped ceria was attributed to Zr 4 +  surface enrichment, block-
ing  some  of  the  reaction  sites.  Indeed,  the  enrichment  of  ZrO
2
on the surface of Zr–Ce solid solutions was further confirmed by
Knoblauch et al.’s observations, in which it was attributed to the
sublimation of CeO
2 on the surface at high temperatures [196] . Ox-
2  were ob-
idation rates of 15%Sm-doped ceria with H
served to be different [61] which could be seen as an evidence of
a surface-limiting process. The surface-limiting mechanism could
also be proved by the observation that the reaction rate with H
2 O
could be largely improved by Rh modification on the surface [131] .

atmosphere  was  studied  in  detail  by  modeling  the  process  with
a two-step surface chemistry (a H
2 O absorption/dissociation step
and  a  charge-transfer  step),  coupled  with  the  bulk-surface  oxy-
gen transport [181,198] . The bulk diffusion is characterized by the
chemical  diffusion  coefficient  (introduced  in  the  next  part).  The

where OH
O is a hydroxyl ion group on an oxygen anion site. In the
2 O molecule is absorbed onto an oxygen vacancy and
first step, a H
dissociates into a hydroxyl ion and an extra proton, which bonds to
an adjacent oxygen to form a second hydroxyl. In the second step,
the charge on the Ce 3 + is transferred to the H in the hydroxyl and
two of them associates to form H
2 . The charge transfer step (the
second reaction) was revealed to be the rate-limiting step [181] .

6.2. Oxygen bulk diffusion and surface exchange reaction

Another  way  for  modeling  the  reaction  process  is  using  the
chemical diffusion coefficient   ̃ D and surface exchange constant   ̃ K ,
which quantify the bulk oxygen diffusion and surface reaction re-
spectively and are defined respectively, as:
b = −  ̃ D ∇c O
j O
b
(cid:3)
j O
s  =   ̃ K

(22)

(21)

eq , c O

where j O
s  is the oxygen flux in the bulk, oxygen con-
centration in the bulk, oxygen flux from the solid surface to the
atmosphere, oxygen concentration on the surface when the solid
material is in equilibrium with the atmosphere, and present oxy-
gen concentration on the solid surface, respectively.

rate of oxygen between the solid surface and the gas atmosphere.
Since it deals with both the solid material and the gas atmosphere,
 ̃ K  is influenced by several factors, including temperature, oxygen
non-stoichiometry, surface modification and gas species.

As already noted, the bulk diffusion and surface exchange pro-
cesses are coupled in the overall reaction process. The overall rate
is  determined  by  the  slower  step.  A  dimensionless  parameter  L ,
could be introduced for determining whether the process is sur-
face exchange- or bulk diffusion-controlled [199,200] :

L =

l  ̃ K
 ̃ D

(23)

where  l  is  the  characteristic  size  of  the  material  (e.g.,  the
radius/half-thickness  for  sphere/planar  geometries,  respectively).
For L < 1
3 , the process is surface-controlled, for L > 30, diffusion-
controlled and for  1
3 < L < 30 exhibits a mixed regime.

Many  kinetic  studies  were  performed  with  relaxation  experi-
ments, in which an abrupt change of temperature or gas compo-
sition was introduced and the transition process to a new equi-
librium  state  was  monitored.  Different  techniques  were  used  to
record the unsteady processes, including secondary ion mass spec-
trometry  (SIMS)  for  measuring  isotope  depth  [90,200,201] ,  ther-
mogravimetry for weight relaxation [193,200,202–204] , and elec-
trical  conductivity  relaxation  [199] .  The  profiles  were  fitted  to
the  solution  of  Fick’s  second  law  with  specific  boundary  condi-
tions  to  extract  the  surface  exchange  constant  or/and  the  diffu-
sion  coefficient.  It  should  be  noted  here  that  for  an  SIMS  anal-
ysis,  the  parameters  extracted  are  tracer  diffusion/exchange  pa-
rameters  ( D ∗ and  K ∗),  which  are  usually  much  lower  than  the
chemical  diffusion/exchange  parameters;  nevertheless  the  partic-
ular  approach  could  also  be  used  for  estimating  the  relative  re-
lation  between  bulk  diffusion  and  surface  exchange.  In  addition
to  unsteady-state  experiments,  the  chemical  diffusion  coefficient
could  be  theoretically  obtained  from  the  electric  conductivity  of
ceria [99,108,109,111–115,117,205,206,207] .

Fig. 8 gives the chemical diffusion coefficient of pure and doped
ceria obtained from different studies. Generally, the diffusion co-
efficient increases with temperature, but decreases with increas-
ing oxygen vacancies concentration. Although there seems to be a
slight discrepancy among results from different ref erences, it could
be generally concluded that ceria is characterized by a high oxygen
diffusion rate. For example, according to the results obtained by
Ackermann et al. [193] , the ambipolar diffusion coefficient in ce-
ria falls in the range of 1.5 × 10 −5 –4 × 10 −4 cm 2 (cid:2)s −1 between 1673
and 1823 K, which is close to the results reported by Chueh et al.,
where  the  characteristic  diffusion  time  for  a  diffusion  length  of
5 μm was calculated to be within several milliseconds, indicating
that bulk diffusion is unlikely to be the rate-limiting step [99] .

The surface exchange constants from different studies are sum-
marized in Fig. 9 . They are closely related to the gas composition
and surface characteristics. The reaction rate of the solid surface
and steam could be significantly increased when the material is
modified with Pt, which is consistent with the experimental stud-
ies conducted with Rh modified cerium-based oxides [99,131,208] .
However, the results showed that the exchange rate in steam is sig-
nificantly lower than that in carbon dioxide, which is inconsistent
with experimental observations [61,99] .

6.3. Synopsis on kinetic studies results

From  the  definition  it  can  be  stated  that  the  chemical  diffu-
sion coefficient (also referred to as ambipolar diffusion coefficient)
describes the oxygen diffusion process under the driving force of
concentration  gradient.  Diffusion  of  oxygen  ions  and  free  elec-
trons (polarons) are coupled to maintain charge neutrality and the
chemical diffusion coefficient is a function of both T and δ (or p O
2 ).
The  surface  exchange  constant   ̃ K  describes  the  surface  exchange

From the studies referred above, general guidelines with respect
to solar reactor design can be drawn. As far as the oxidation ki-
netics are concerned, those with steam and carbon dioxide can be
different, and in fact which one is faster can depend on the redox
material employed. In any case longer oxidation times will be re-
quired for the slower reaction for converting the same amounts of

steam and carbon dioxide. Such differences can become especially
important in the case of syngas production via co-splitting of hy-
drogen and carbon monoxide where maybe the targeted syngas ra-
tio cannot be achieved even by adjusting the ratio of the reactant
gases in the inlet; in such a case separate production of the two
gaseous components and post-production mixing can be the only
option.

Elaborate kinetic models, when derived under realistic condi-
tions, provide valuable insight into the relevant duration of the re-
actions of the two cycle steps and hence allow for optimization of
transport rates and transit times during actual reactor operation.
This in turn allows for the simulation of different heating/cooling
scenarios,  investigating  their  effect  on  production  rates  and  op-
timizing  operation  strategies  to  maximize  productivity  and  effi-
ciency, as it will be discussed below, after describing the various
reactors employed for that purpose. In closing, this lack of more
closely linking kinetic models to reactor design considerations is
indeed an aspect that has not yet gained substantial attention by
the scientific community in the field and future work should be di-
rected towards this approach too, since relatively little information
is currently available.

7. Solar-to-fuel system efficiency and energy losses

Having addressed the issues relevant to the redox material, we
return now to the solar-to-fuel efficiency calculations and in par-
ticular  to  the  denominator  of  Eq  (6)  and  the  estimations  of  the
energy-consuming terms  during  solar  operation. The  in-principle
high  theoretical  efficiency  potential  of  the  solar-thermal  process
has  been  hailed  as  a  breakthrough  in  the  water  splitting  tech-
nologies especially compared to the overall theoretical efficiency
of other WS schemes. However, in real operating systems, various
energy losses from the heat transfer processes together with the
energy consumption of the required auxiliary systems, as it will
be described in more detail below, render the actual system effi-
ciency  lower.  Many  thermodynamic  models  have  been  proposed
to  evaluate  the  impact  of  these  different  ener gy  loss  terms  and
predict the energy conversion efficiency of the whole system, es-
pecially based on ceria redox reactions [130,209–215] . As pointed
out [216] , such efficiency calculations incorporate the assumption
that only solar primary energy is used for the entire reactor opera-
tion i.e. not only for the needs of endothermic reactions and sen-
sible heating of the feedstocks to the required temperatures, but
also - through heat equivalents - for any mechanical work required
like vacuum pumping, inert gas production, compression, separa-
2 /CO
tion of the products from any unconverted reactants (e.g. H
from H
2 mixtures respectively), movement of solids
etc. The results and conclusions are different due to different as-
sumptions/parameters/ approaches employed on the energy losses
estimations ( Table 3 ). In order to state meaningful and reasonable
values for the solar-to-fuel efficiency, it is crucial to take the en-
tire power demand of auxiliary systems into account, especially for
oxygen removal during reduction and heating CO
2 O to the ox-
idation temperature level of the splitting process. Especially if the
conversion rates are low, a large amount of excess steam has to be
generated, involving a substantial energy demand due to the heat
of vaporization of water. This affects the choice of operational pa-
rameters and materials, and if this factor is not taken into account,
some materials or process parameters may appear to favor a highly
efficient reaction, although they do not. The omission of the signif-
icant auxiliary power demand associated with such redox cycles in
many cases and inept process models are the main reason for the
enormous spread of efficiency values reported in the literature, for
instance between 0.04 and 77% for thermochemical water splitting,
as can be seen in Table 3 . Thus, it does not seem to make much
sense to directly compare the results or build a new model with-

out experimental support. Naturally, in order to manage the expec-
tations of the general public and scientific community with respect
to the current technology readiness level and imminent commer-
cial viability of thermochemical fuels production, the publication
of realistic efficiency values is essential. Therefore, in this section,
we only introduce the various sources of energy losses and clar-
ify the effects of different reaction modes (reaction conditions and
technological approaches) on the overall efficiency. This would fa-
cilitate the establishment of criteria for reactor design and the un-
derstanding of the pros and cons of different types of reactors from
the view of energy efficiency.

A generalized schematic overview of the process/solar reactor,
showing  the  various  heat  and  work  requirements  can  be  seen
in  Fig.  10  (adapted  from  [214] ).  In  the  whole  system,  energy  is
mainly  consumed  as  heat  and  work  in  five  ways:  heat  dissipa-
tion losses, heat needed to drive the reactions (the reduction one),
energy  required  for  (any  kind  of)  oxygen  removal  in  the  reduc-
tion step plus any other auxiliary functions as mentioned above,
heat needed to heat the gas species to the required temperatures
and heat needed to heat the solid material to the reaction tem-
peratures.  A  more  elaborate  discussion  on  each  of  these  terms
follows.

7.1. Heat dissipation

Heat dissipation losses include re-radiation from the reactor’s
aperture and heat conduction and convection through the reactor’s
surface.

7.1.1. Re-radiation losses

When a perfectly insulated black-body cavity receiver absorbs
continuously sunlight of quantity Q
solar , its temperature increases
and  at  some  point  the  receiver  starts  to  re-radiate.  Since  the
intensity  of  radiation  by  a  black  body  is  proportional  to  the
fourth  power  of  its  temperature,  the  corresponding  re-radiation
loss Q

working  temperature  of  1773 K  integrated  with  a  concentrating
system with C = 30 0 0, the re-radiation loss accounts for 18.68% of
all solar irradiation to the receiver, and for a system with C = 50 0 0,
this number is 11.21%.

7.1.2. Heat losses through conduction and convection

The heat conduction and convection at the reactor surface are
closely related to the thermal insulation performance of the reac-
tor. In theoretical calculation studies, due to the lack of exact ex-
perimental data, they were considered by multiplying a coefficient
by all the energy absorbed by the reactor, giving:

perature  (298 K)  is  plotted  in  Fig.  11  as  a  function  of  operation
temperature and solar concentration ratio. Fig. 11 also shows the
upper limit efficiency of a pure Carnot heat engine, i.e. one with-
out any re-radiation losses, as the uppermost curve, a monoton-
ically increasing function of the cavity temperature. On the con-
trary, all devices characterized by re-radiation losses will have sys-
tem efficiencies that first rise as the cavity temperature is raised,
go through a maximum and then decrease to zero as the cavity
temperature  continues  to  increase.  In  other  words,  even  though
from the Carnot limitation perspective one should aim to operate
thermochemical processes at the highest upper temperature pos-
sible – provided that irreversibilities are not introduced, from the
standpoint of reactor design and operation perspective there exists
a temperature threshold of diminishing returns beyond which ther-
mal re-radiation losses dominate. Thus, there exists an optimum
temperature for maximum efficiency; this maximum can reach val-
ues in the range 65–80% at temperatures between 1100 and 1800 K
for uniform power–flux distributions with concentrations between
10 0 0  and  13,0 0 0  [218] .  This  is  exactly  the  reason  why  the  solar-
thermal-driven hydrogen/solar fuels approach has attracted so much
interest:  with  these  operation  parameters  being  achievable  in  mod-
ern solar towers, the solar-thermal process is inherently characterized
by  an  in-principle  very  high  theoretical  efficiency  potential  vs.  that
of other WS schemes like photovoltaic electricity-driven electrolysis or
artificial photosynthesis.

the  system  efficiency  was  still  predicted  to  increase  with  tem-
perature  until  at  least  20 0 0 K  [130,209–215]  mainly  due  to  the

Indicatively,  a  value  of  F  of  0.2  was  used  from  the  UoM

[212,213,215] .

Re-radiation  loss  is  inherent  with  the  solar-thermal  process,
while the surface heat loss via conduction and convection can be
alleviated by increasing the reactor scale (lower surface/volume ra-
tio) and strengthening the insulation.

7.2. Reaction heat

The energy needed to drive the reduction reaction was usually
calculated through integration of the partial molar reduction en-
thalpy [130,209] .

It  could  be  seen  as  the  chemical  energy  stored  in  the  re-

ergy of the gaseous fuels during oxidation (heating value of the
fuel). The rest of it is released as thermal energy since the oxi-
dation step is exothermic. The quantity converted to chemical en-
ergy in the gaseous fuel during oxidation depends on the percent-
age of the non-stoichiometric reduction extent that can be recov-
red − δox ) according
ered during oxidation - i.e. on the quantity ( δ
to Eqs. (5a) and ( 5b ), which has to be multiplied by the reduc-
tion enthalpy- of the particular material employed. For example,
for  pure  ceria  with  a  reduction  extent  of  δ
red = 0.1,  the  average
reduction enthalpy is ∼436 kJ (cid:2)mol −1  [143] . This could be seen as
chemical  energy  stored  in  the  redox  material,  most  of  which  is
converted to the chemical energy in the H
2 (285.8 kJ/mol) or CO
2
(283.0 kJ (cid:2)mol −1 ) during oxidation if full replenishment of oxygen
is assumed. The rest of it is released as thermal energy, which was
regarded as additional heat loss if there is no suitable method for
heat recovery [210] . In some models, it was proposed to be used
as process heat to heat the redox material or supply the energy for
pumps, but these alternatives showed very limited impact on the
overall efficiency [143,209,214] . This part of process heat could be
lowered by using a redox material with lower reduction enthalpy,
such as Zr-doped ceria for example. In this case, with the same re-
duction extent of δ
red = 0.1, the average reduction enthalpy of 10%
Zr doped ceria is ∼360 kJ (cid:2)mol −1 meaning that 76 kJ/mol could be
saved in terms of reaction heat by using Zr doped ceria. However,
due to the poor oxidation performance of Zr doped ceria, the oxi-
2 O) demand is larger than that of pure ceria, leading
dizer (CO
to a higher gas heat demand. This issue gradually dominates as the
oxidation temperature increases. Therefore, as predicted by Bulfin
et al., although Zr doped ceria have higher fuel productivities than
pure ceria, their benefits on efficiency could only be shown with a
larger temperature difference between two steps [214] .

7.3. Gaseous products/reactants separation work

7.4.2. Vacuum pumping

For H

2 O  and  H

2 O splitting cycles, the contribution of separation work is
practically  negligible,  since  the  products  (H
2 )  could  be
separated by condensation; there exits though an additional ther-
mal energy cost for water vaporization during the heating process.
On  the  contrary,  CO  and  CO
2  must  be  separated  by  a  different
means. This separation work is calculated via the gases separation
entropy, assuming a final CO/CO
2  ratio achieved at the separator
and employing a separation efficiency value ( ηsep ) [38] . However,
these differences between H
2 splitting cycles and their
2 O and CO
thermodynamic properties cause very minor differences ( < 2%) on
the overall system efficiency.

7.4. Oxygen removal work

According to the reaction principles, the oxygen released in the
reduction step should be removed in time to maintain a low oxy-
gen  partial  pressure.  Theoretically  this  requires  very  low  energy
2 , red = 1e −5 bar,
cost (14.26 kJ for 1 mole fuel production with  p
O
accounting for just 0.2% of the total solar energy input [131] but
in practice, the energy cost of current oxygen removal methods is
much higher than the ideal value. There are various approaches for
oxygen removal, namely by inert gas sweeping, by vacuum pump-
ing, by oxygen-ion conduction through ion conducting membranes
and by chemical scavenging (or thermochemical pumping) which
are described below, including exemplary relevant calculations for
each case.

7.4.1. Inert gas sweeping

In the earlier studies, including experiments and/or thermody-
namic analysis, an inert gas (N
2 or Ar) was usually used/considered
to sweep out the released oxygen, in which case the energy needed
for subsequent gas separation and regeneration and recirculation
of the inert gas should be taken into account [130,212–215] . The
amount of inert gas needed and the sensible heat loss associated
with it are discussed in the next section. As suggested, there are
currently three air separation technologies for nitrogen production:
membrane  separation,  pressure  swing  adsorption  and  cryogenic
separation [213,215,219] . Cryogenic separation shows a lower en-
ergy cost of 12–16 kJ (cid:2)mol −1 (per mole N
2 ) when the aiming oxygen
pressure in nitrogen is below ∼5 × 10 −4 bar. Based on this data, the
solar energy demand for producing nitrogen for ceria reduction in
an isothermal cycle below 1800 K could be 5–23 times higher than
the solar energy needed for the rest of the system, indicating that
using inert gas for reduction may have a very destructive impact
on the system efficiency [130] . More detailed analysis recommends
the use of the other two methods in the case of high oxygen par-
tial pressure on considering their advantages in the high oxygen
concentration range. Thus the calculation of energy consumption
in the production of inert gas is recommended as [215,219] :

and a coefficient η

version  efficiency  should  be  introduced,  giving  the  solar  energy
cost for nitrogen production:

N 2 , production =
Q

N 2 , production

(30)

This efficiency is often assumed to be 40% [175,180] , but con-
sidering the current status of solar-thermal power plants, 20–25%
seems to be a more realistic option [2,141] .

Vacuum pump-assisted reduction was thus proposed to avoid
using inert gas [220] and thermodynamic analysis showed that sig-
nificant gains in efficiency could be expected with an ideal pump
[131] . In the ideal case, the energy cost for pumping gas from a
low pressure p vacuum to normal pressure p

0 is:

W

pump , ideal = n gas RT ln

p 0
p vacuum

(31)

However, a coefficient ηpump should be introduced as the ratio
between the ideal work and the real work consumed, giving the
work consumed by a real pump:

W

pump , real =

ηpump

(32)

The efficiency of a commercial mechanical pump could be ob-
tained  from  the  envelope  function  developed  by  Brendelberger
et al. [221] , and furthermore, the solar-to-electricity efficiency, η
elec
is again in this case, still needed. Thus the solar energy cost for
pumping oxygen out is:

Q pump =

n O 2 RT ln  p 0
p

(33)

The efficiency of pumps drops fast as the targeted pressure de-
creases [221–223] . It could be 15–37% when p vacuum > 100 Pa, but
decreases fast to < 5% when p vacuum < 10 Pa [221] . Reduction un-
der vacuum was proved to be better than reduction under inert
gas, especially at a moderate vacuum pressure.

7.4.3. Mixed (oxygen) ion- and electron-conducting (MIEC)
membranes

An alternative technique for continuous oxygen removal from
the reaction products involves the use of dense membranes man-
ufactured of mixed (oxygen) ion- and electron-conducting (MIEC)
materials, like ceria or perovskites. Provided that an oxygen con-
centration is established along their sides, these membranes can
operate  as  oxygen  transfer  materials  at  elevated  temperatures.
In  the  early  stages  of  solar  WS  thermochemistry,  oxide  mem-
branes were considered for high-temperature separation of hydro-
gen from oxygen in direct water thermolysis solar reactors [224–
226] .  However  the  idea  of  combining  redox-oxides-based  water-
splitting thermochemical cycles with oxide MIEC membranes in an
isothermal thermochemical cycle was coined in 2008, employing a
(non-solar) La–Sr–Fe perovskite membrane reactor [227] . The op-
erating  principle  foresees  the  membrane’s  solid  surface  to  sepa-
rate the reactor chamber into two compartments: the splitting side
and the “oxygen sink” side. The gases to be split i.e. H
2 flow
in the former, while the latter is maintained under very low oxy-
gen partial pressure either by vacuum or by an oxidizable com-
4 , where in this case WS is combined with
pound (e.g. methane CH
methane reforming producing simultaneously hydrogen and syn-
gas). In this configuration the oxygen vacancy-containing solid ma-
terial reacts with the oxygen-containing gas in the splitting side as
described by Eqs (5a ) and ( 5b ), in order to fill the vacancies with
oxygen. Due to the very low or zero oxygen partial pressure of the
opposite compartment, the lattice oxygens are transported through
the membrane therein, where they desorb to produce gaseous oxy-
gen. At steady-state conditions the two reactions, oxidation and re-
duction, proceed simultaneously; there exists a concentration gra-
dient and flux of oxygen from the splitting compartment to the
“oxygen sink” compartment, with a continuous flux of stoichiomet-
ric amount of oxygen vacancies and electrons to the opposite di-
rection. The particular concept adopts a novel way to use the redox
material which serves on the one hand as a barrier for pressures
and  gases  and  on  the  other  hand  as  a  channel  for  oxygen  ions.

The cycle is isothermal avoiding temperature- as well as pressure-
swing  operation.  Nevertheless,  high  temperatures  are  needed  to
ensure fast diffusion rate of oxygen in the bulk solid; these can
be achieved by concentrated solar irradiation. The idea was further
elaborated in a series of publications by the same group, without,
though being demonstrated by them in a solar reactor. In parallel
the concept of such permeable oxygen membrane reactors based
on various perovskite compositions was widely studied for high-
temperature, (non-solar-aided) methane reforming, oxygen separa-
tion, and oxy-fuel combustion etc. in combination with water split-
ting [228–231] and was subsequently extended from other groups
to  modeling  [207,232]  and  construction  and  operation  of  ceria-
based  solar  membrane  reactors  to  be  described  later  on  in  the
manuscript.

7.4.4. Oxygen chemical scavenging and thermochemical oxygen
pumping

Another continuous oxygen removal approach, namely thermo-
chemical oxygen pumping was recently proposed by Brendelberger
et al., in which another redox cycle with an easily reduced ma-
2 O  splitting  cycle  to  absorb  the
2 /H
terial  is  coupled  with  the  CO
oxygen  released  in  the  reduction  step  [221] .  In  this  context  the
concept can be considered as a sub-category of oxygen chemical
scavenging, in which oxygen in a gas stream is reacted with an
active  metal  to  further  reduce  the  oxygen  partial  pressure,  used
widely in air separation using redox pairs of the type oxide/metal
like the CuO/Cu system [233] . In fact a similar approach was pro-
posed in 2005 for the ZnO/Zn cycle, in order to mitigate the issue
of oxygen–Zinc gas-phase recombination mentioned already [234] ;
therein, given the high temperatures required to implement the re-
duction of ZnO, only Ni was identified as a possible oxygen scav-
enger,  and  the  ZnO/Zn  cycle  was  foreseen  to  be  coupled  to  the
NiO/Ni one. The same concept, employing Mg metal as an oxygen
scavenger was also considered for ceria redox cycling by Lin and
Haussener [212] .

3 O

However, the recent thermochemical oxygen pumping approach
has been fertilized with the latest wealth of work and informa-
tion on redox-oxides-based thermochemical storage concepts men-
tioned in Section 2.3 , that involve metal oxides reduction of the
oxidized state of oxides to their reduced state rather than to the
metal,  in  full  analogy  with  thermochemical  WS/CDS  cycles  for
fuel  production.  The  “pumping” oxide  pairs,  such  as  Co
4 /CoO
[235]  and  perovskites  [236–238]  can  be  reduced  under  air  and
at moderately high temperatures. Theoretically the thermochemi-
cal pump could have a lower energy cost than mechanical pumps,
which  brings  considerable  energy  savings  for  oxygen  removal
[221] . Besides, as has been recently experimentally demonstrated
with ceria, the reduction of the CO
2 O splitting material could
also be significantly enhanced with a thermochemical pump due
to the pump’s ability to maintain a lower oxygen pressure com-
pared to the commonly used inert gas [239] . The enhancement of
the practical reduction achieved at a certain temperature could be
seen as a significant step forward because on the one hand ad-
dresses the issue of low productivity and consequently excessive
demand of ceria that has been argued to be detrimental for large
scale implementation [36,209] and on the other hand results in a
relative reduction of some of the energy losses (especially the solid
heat loss) per fuel unit production. However, considering that the
oxygen removal rate may be relying on a diffusion process under
the  driving  force  of  a  concentration  gradient,  the  kinetic  perfor-
mance of this method may be not encouraging, which can be a
crucial issue for its practical implementation. Hence, the impact of
this approach on the system efficiency needs to be validated under

7.5. Gas-phase heat

There  could  be  considerable  energy  requirement  associated
with the heating of gases from room temperature to the reaction
temperatures, especially when a substantial amount of inert gas is
used to keep the atmosphere reductive. Therefore, gas phase heat
exchangers with very high heat recuperation ( > 90%) are indispens-
able for the system to achieve a considerable efficiency. The gas-
phase heat is usually calculated considering a heat recovery effi-
ciency ηgas :

When evaluating the gas-phase heat, a crucial question concerns
the  minimum  gas  demand.  This  is  closely  related  to  the  solid–
gas flow configuration of the system [130,212,213,240] . For a re-
actor in which ceria and inert gas are well-mixed in the reduction
step, the inert gas demand would be approximately equivalent to
the inverse of the oxygen fraction, meaning that for a reduction
chamber with a total pressure of 1 bar, 10 5  times as much inert
gas as oxygen would be needed to maintain an oxygen pressure of
O2 = 10 −5 bar [210,215] . Although the sweep gas demand could be
p
lowered by choosing counter-current flow configuration [213,240] ,
the amount of inert gas is still at least two orders of magnitude
higher than the amount of reactant or product gases [240] . For ex-
ample, more than 100 times higher amount of inert gas is needed
O2 = 10 −3 bar. Realistic considerations show that the inert
to get p
gas  demand  of  a  countercurrent  flow  is  only  about  an  order  of
magnitude less than that obtained by the well-mixed model [240] .
For  the  oxidation  step,  as  can  be  derived  from  Eq.  (17),  the
demand of oxidizer increases with increasing oxidation tempera-
ture  because  the  oxidation  reaction  becomes  thermodynamically
unfavorable as temperature increases. In some studies the oxidizer
was assumed to be completely converted, an assumption valid only
when  the  oxidation  temperature  is  relatively  low  (for  example,
< 1073 K) [99,210] and the amount of CO
2 O is no greater than
that required to fill the oxygen vacancies.

2 /H

Besides, it should be noted that almost all the above calcula-
tions of gas demand are based on thermodynamic considerations,
i.e. at chemical equilibrium end-states, not taking reaction rates,
hold times and transient operational states into account [18,241] .
So  far  only  a  small  number  of  studies  have  attempted  to  incor-
porate  the  reaction  kinetics  into  the  estimation  of  gas  demand
or system efficiency [132,242,243] . In practice the gas demand is
closely  related  to  the  specific  design  of  the  reactor,  and  it  may
not be an economical option to achieve equilibrium given that the
rate  of  reaction  is  limited  and  decreases  rapidly  as  the  reaction
progresses. The kinetic performance was thus suggested to be in-
cluded in the efficiency model and both the flow rate and reaction
duration should be optimized for a practical maximum efficiency.

7.6. Solid-phase heat

The solid-phase heat refers to the energy consumption due to
consecutive heating and cooling of the solid oxides when there is
a temperature swing between the two steps (non-isothermal cy-
cles), which was also shown to play a significant role in system
efficiency. Similarly, it is usually calculated on considering a solid–
solid heat recovery efficiency η

( ∼80 J (cid:2)mol −1 (cid:2)K −1 ) was shown to be dependent on both temper-
ature and oxygen non-stoichiometry [244] . However, the effect of
this variation on efficiency is negligible. For an estimation of the
heat capacity of any redox material, a good approximation is given
through the Dulong–Petit law, which states that the high temper-
ature limit for the molar heat capacity of any material is 3R (cid:2)n A
with n A denoting the number of atoms in the unit cell. In the case
2 unit cell without oxygen va-
of ceria with three atoms in the CeO
cancies, we reach a result of 75 J (cid:2)mol −1 (cid:2)K −1 , which is close to the
value stated above.

For example, as estimated by Li et al., the system efficiency of
water splitting through the ceria cycle with a reduction tempera-
ture of 1773 K can be improved from ∼8% to above 20% by intro-
ducing 90% solid-phase heat recovery [219] . Besides, in a real sys-
tem, not only the redox material, but also the reactor components
adjacent to it may be repeatedly heated in consecutive cycles. The
energy demand of the reactor components indicates that the en-
ergy cost for solid heating may be much higher than that predicted
by theoretical calculations.

The recovery of the solid-phase heat calls for solid–solid heat
transfer between redox materials between the reduction and oxi-
dation stages, which however, at the same time, in order to drive
the  cycle,  should  be  implemented  securing  that  the  gaseous  at-
mospheres between the two stages will not be mixed. These re-
quirements make solid-phase heat recovery quite technically chal-
lenging. Reactors with solid-solid heat transfer parts were thus de-
signed (to be introduced and described in the next section). Dif-
ferent from direct solid–solid heat transfer between redox mate-
rials,  some  research  groups  also  proposed  that  solid  heat  recov-
ery can be achieved by means of redox-inert heat transfer media
[245–247] . However, the feasibility of this concept at the required
temperature levels is still subjected to experimental validation.

The  overall  energy  efficiency  reduction  due  to  cyclic  heat-
ing  and  cooling  of  the  metal  oxide,  was  one  of  the  main  mo-
tivations  that  led  to  the  introduction  of  isothermal  cycles,  al-
ready mentioned in Section 4.2 . Isothermal cycles invoke additional
benefits  from  simpler  reactor  designs  and  minimization  of  ther-
mal shock/stresses. However, because the oxidation temperature is
raised to the level of reduction temperature, for the oxidation step,
as just mentioned in the section above, according to Eq. (17), ex-
2 /CO) ratios are required to

cessive oxidizer (steam/CO
overcome the unfavorable thermodynamics. Thus the requirement
for heating this excess steam to the high, reduction/oxidation tem-
perature just shifts the burden from the high solid-phase heat to
that of high gas-phase heat. On the other side, the fuel productiv-
ity is significantly lowered because only the difference of oxygen
pressure is used to drive the redox cycle. These trends are inherent
to  the  water  splitting  thermodynamics  and  hence  material-  and
reactor-independent [248] . In view of these, near-isothermal cycles
with a smaller temperature difference potentially combined with
a well-targeted pressure swing were proven thermodynamically to
be a better reaction strategy leading to the most efficient mode
of  operation  [143,248] .  In  practice,  the  optimal  temperature  dif-
ference ( (cid:3)T = T
red − T ox ) could be obtained by balancing the solid-
phase heat and gas-phase heat.

8. Actual solar redox reactors built and operated

Having described the efficiency issues that solar redox oxide re-
actors have to address, we will now present in more details the
actual solar reactors employed so far, giving emphasis to the cases
where  ceria  was  used  as  the  redox  material.  It  should  however,
be  borne  in  mind  that  reactor  concepts  tested  with  other  non-
volatile materials such as iron-based oxides, may also be applied
to cerium-based ones. Continuing from our previous first catego-
rization of solar redox-oxide based reactors we will first describe

the reactors operating on the principle of moving the solid redox
material and then those who instead keep the solid material fixed
and involve movement of only gases and sunrays.

8.1. Reactors with moving redox oxide material

As already elaborated, such reactors are targeted to address the
issues  of  both  continuous  operation  and  heat  recuperation.  The
redox  oxide  material  can  be  moved  in  space  in  the  form  of  ei-
ther particle streams or bulk solid structures (e.g. rotating drums,
disks, fins etc.). Particle streams can absorb concentrated solar ir-
radiation and reach high temperatures. Furthermore they can be
stored  as  well  as  transported  at  high  temperatures  inside  well-
insulated containers and hence can be used also as solar heat stor-
age medium, exchanging their enthalpy with other fluids or par-
ticle streams off-sun upon demand. Such moving streams can be
also, in principle, continuously fed into solar reactors ( Fig. 1 b) and
thus address favorably issues of continuous on-sun operation and
scalability. The different types of such particle reactors span rotat-
ing solar kilns, gravity-fed cavity reactors, aerosol reactors, mov-
ing, fluidized and spouted bed reactors; their various solar appli-
cations proposed have been described in recent reviews [249,250] .
The ones specifically tested for redox solar fuels production are de-
scribed below, followed by the respective reactors employing mov-
ing solid oxide monolithic structures. The latter, essentially rotat-
ing redox-oxide-made or redox-oxide-coated structures, have been
proposed as heat recuperation means, alternatively to flowing par-
ticle streams.

8.1.1. Aerosol reactors

Aerosol  reactors,  i.e.  reactors  where  the  solid  reactant  is  in
the  form  of  very  fine  particles  suspended  in  a  gaseous  stream,
were firstly investigated in two-step thermochemical cycles for the
volatile redox pair ZnO/Zn by the UoC group [251] to perform the
ZnO  thermal  dissociation  step.  The  idea  was  based  on  previous
successful industrial-scale production of WC powders in such re-
actors  by  the  group’s  leader  in  DoW  Chemicals  Co.  The  concept
was implemented on an indirectly irradiated reactor: the ZnO par-
ticles were fed and suspended in an electrically heated graphite
tube, to be heated thereof by radiation. The rationale for such an
operation is the combination of continuous feeding and rapid heat-
ing of dilute, fine particle streams; such tubes can be eventually
placed inside cavities absorbing concentrated solar irradiation and
re-radiate to the particles, in the so-called “hot wall” reactor con-
figuration.

The concept was subsequently also pursued from the ETH/PSI
group for both steps of the same cycle – reduction of ZnO parti-
cles to Zn ones that were subsequently reacted in situ with CO
2
[252]  -  and  extended  by  them  to  non-volatile  systems,  specifi-
cally for the reduction of ceria. The ETH configuration involved ce-
ria particles flowing counter-currently to Ar sweeping gas in alu-
mina  tubes  which  were  placed  initially  in  an  electrically  heated
reactor [253] . Subsequently, a single alumina tube ( D out = 50 mm,
in = 42 mm, L = 850 mm) was placed in a 2 kW
D
th lab-scale proto-
type cavity receiver where it was indirectly irradiated under fluxes
approaching 40 0 0 suns through a windowless 30 mm-diameter cir-
cular aperture as depicted in Fig. 12 a. The residence time was of
the order of 1 s. The fresh primary particles of 2.44 μm mean size
sintered into stable particles of 150 μm mean size after cycling at
1919 K.  The  reduction  extent  could  approach  those  predicted  by
thermodynamics for small particles with a low flow rate; however,
decreased significantly as the flow rate increased due to limited
residence time for efficient heat and mass transfer. Specifically, for
large particles ( > 200 μm), it was primarily limited by heat trans-
fer, and for smaller particles by the gas phase advection of pro-
duced O

conditions used in simulations (reprinted from Ref [257] with permission of Elsevier).

Even though the ETH group shifted their activities to structured
ceria reactors (to be described below), multiple particle-containing
tubes indirectly irradiated inside a solar cavity are still investigated
by  the  UoC  group.  The  so-called  SurroundSun  reactor  was  pro-
posed  at  first  for  stationary  particles  (packed  beds)  of  hercynite
for  cyclic,  isothermal  WS/CDS  inside  SiC  tubes  ( Fig.  12 b,  [255] ,

Fig. 12 c, [256] ), where the two steps could be performed sequen-
tially by alternating the gases entering the tubes (CO
2 O or in-
ert). However, akcnowledging the fact that large temperature gra-
dients could  be developed through the  bed, the group  currently
proposes operation in the form of fluidized beds [258] , conceptu-
ally envisaged in a parallel arrangement within a solar cavity on

top of a solar tower facility. The reactors assembly switches be-
tween inert flow during reduction and steam flow during oxida-
tion  under  a  minimal  temperature  difference  between  oxidation
and reduction, i.e., near-isothermal operation ( Fig. 12 d, e, [257] ).
In this perspective, further issues occur in relevance to the tube
material: alumina is not only white but suffers from poor thermal
shock resistance whereas graphite and SiC tubes that can absorb
concentrated solar irradiation have to be prevented from contact
with not only gaseous oxygen but also with the solid oxide. Inter-
nal oxide coatings on SiC tubes are proposed to address this is-
sue; however these will further contribute to the process cost and
complexity.

8.1.2. Moving packed bed reactors

2 O/CO

Along  a  similar  approach  of  employing  solid  particle  streams
as  HTF,  a  U.S.  research  team  from  SNL,  Bucknell  University  and
Arizona  State  University  proposed  a  moving  packed  bed  reactor
in 2013, targeted on addressing the heat recuperation issues de-
scribed above and simulated and modeled with CeO
2  as a reac-
tive material [220] . The main idea is the implementation of indi-
rect  solid-to-solid sensible heat recovery  through conduction  via
the walls of the inner of two concentric tubes ( Fig. 13 a): while the
oxidized redox particles are transported via an Auger conveyor in
the outer tube to the top of a solar tower to be reduced via direct
irradiation in a solar window-covered reactor, they are pre-heated
by the counter-current flowing stream of the already hot reduced
particles coming out of the solar reactor in the inner tube. Fuel
production (H
2 /CO) takes place in a chamber at the bottom of the
tower where the reduced particles are fed and exposed to reactant
gases (H
2 ). Upon completion of the splitting reactions, the
re-oxidized particles are returned to the top of the tower through
the outer region of the recuperator/elevator to continue the cyclic
process.  The  concept  needs  to  be  complemented  by  an  effective
seal between the two reactors that have to operate under differ-
ent atmospheres; in the particular configuration this seal has to
be implemented at the exit of the solar reactor, i.e. the top of the
inner tube. The authors proposed to use the bed of the particles
itself to constrict gas flow, i.e. employ it as an isolation valve be-
tween the thermal reduction and fuel production chambers. This
concept  of  using  powder  beds  as  sealing  valves  was  further  ex-
panded to multi-stage, “cascading pressure” operation in combina-
tion  with vacuum  pumping instead of  usage of  inert gas  during
reduction, to lower the energy consumption for oxygen removal.
The reduction of the redox oxide was envisioned to be carried out
in  the  so-called  cascading  pressure  receiver–reactor  (CPR 2 )  pro-
totype, in a cascade of chambers at successively lower pressures
( Fig.  13 b),  within  which  the  oxygen  could  be  pumped  near  the
pressure at which it evolves from the oxide and the required pump
work could be effectively decreased [259,260] . In addition to the
capability of solid heat recovery, several features essential for high
efficiency were also stated to be incorporated in the reactor, such
as spatial separation of pressures, continuous on-sun operation and
direct solar illumination of the working material. To demonstrate
the concept at realistic process temperatures and pressures, a pro-
totype  device  with  two  thermal  reduction  chambers  (TRCs)  tar-
geting  ∼100 Pa  and  ∼30 Pa,  respectively  was  designed  ( Fig.  13 b)
and  its  operation  was  simulated  under  various  operating  condi-
tions [261] . The details of the TRC design - that necessitates the
use of a beam-down configuration for the incoming radiation - are
shown in the schematic of Fig. 13 c: a thin, directly irradiated, mov-
ing particle bed is continuously transported by a horizontal mo-
tion conveyor plate while heated [262] . The two concepts of solid–
solid heat recovery and redox chemistry have been validated sepa-
rately so far. With respect to the former, inert particles could be
circulated  through  elevators  and  solid–solid  sensible  heat  recov-
ery could be accomplished through converse moving of particles

in and out of a transferring tube. 50% solid-to-solid heat recovery
was demonstrated experimentally with this kind of configuration,
but only at temperature levels as low as 433 K so far; neverthe-
less a heat recovery effectiveness of 80% was stated to be feasible
after optimization [263] . Further analysis also showed that the re-
actor efficiency was substantially independent of direct normal ir-
radiation, which could lead to an annual average efficiency close
to the design-point one [264] . The particle movement system has
been  constructed  and  tested  with  ceria  particles  ( ∼250 μm)  ini-
tially at ambient temperature ( Fig. 13 d). The chemical part of re-
duction under vacuum with simultaneous pressure separation via
a redox powder bed was tested in a one-chamber TRC, followed by
subsequent hydrogen production in a non-solar reactor ( Fig. 13 e),
demonstrating the in-principle concept’s feasibility [265] . However,
still a lot of work has to be performed in multi-chamber reduction
cascades to verify the practical utility of this approach in solar fuel
production cycles.

8.1.3. Spouted bed reactors

A spouted bed reactor integrated with a beam-down concen-
trating system was proposed, fabricated, and investigated by the
research group from Niigata University, Japan [266–269] . As shown
in  Fig.  14 a,  the  reactive  particles  are  supposed  to  be  blown  up-
wards and fluidized in the inner draft tube, heated at the top of
their trajectory by the irradiation coming through the quartz win-
dow, and then circulated to the bottom from the annular space be-
tween the draft tube and the reactor wall. By controlling the tem-
perature and changing the injecting gas, reduction and oxidation
reactions could be performed in sequence [270–272] . The particu-
lar reactor, in contrast to the previously mentioned ones employing
moving particles, has the peculiarity that the particles are mov-
ing always within the same chamber; in other words the concept
of gas products separation is temporal and not spatial, thus avoid-
ing problems of moving parts and sealing at high temperatures be-
tween the reduction and oxidation regions, naturally though, at the
expense of no solid heat recuperation. Further advantages claimed
are  that  a  uniform  temperature  distribution  within  the  particles
is more favored in comparison to other reactor concepts, due to
the  particles’  forced  circulation  within  the  reactor,  which  in  ad-
dition helps mitigating sintering and agglomeration. The concept
has evolved from a small-scale reactor irradiated by a 3–5 kW
th
th ) “beam-down” sun-
solar simulator, first to a bigger (30–40 kW
simulator with xenon-arc lamps and subsequently to a 100 kW
th
beam-down solar  concentrating  system  with  a  secondary  ellipti-
cal reflector built in August 2012 at University of Miyazaki, Japan
( Fig. 14 b), with the major part of the development campaigns hav-
ing been performed with “plain” and ZrO
4 par-
2 -supported NiFe
ticles.  However,  studies  with  CeO
2  particles  have  also  been  re-
ported, in reactors made of Inconel and stainless steel. The particle
size is an additional crucial parameter to be considered. The par-
ticles must be large enough to be blown up/fluidized properly but
also small enough not to introduce detrimental mass transfer limi-
tation phenomena during participation in the redox scheme. Para-
metric studies with respect to the particle size of CeO
2  powders
performed in the initial, 5 kW
th  version reactor, identified a de-
sirable particle size range smaller than 300 μm [250,273,274] . Ex-
th simulator–reactor setup were performed
periments in the 30 kW
recently with a batch of about 8 kg of CeO
2 particles of diameter
range of 10 0–30 0 μm The bed temperature at the center position
of the fluidized bed reached 1673–1773 K during the thermal re-
duction, oxygen-producing step; water decomposition was subse-
quently  performed  at  a  central  bed  temperature  of  1073–1173 K,
producing  hydrogen  of  a  ratio  to  O
2  between  1.7  and  2.0,  very
close to the stoichiometric value. The external reactor wall tem-
perature remained below 1473 K during the entire experiments, a
fact protecting the reactor from thermomechanical damages [275] .

actors have been recently incorporated in the Miyazaki solar plant
for on-site campaigns [276] .

8.1.4. Rotating drum/fin reactors

A rotary-type solar hydrogen production reactor with two cells
was  introduced  by  the  group  from  Tokyo  Institute  of  Technol-
ogy,  Japan  [277–281] .  The  reactor  assembly  comprised  a  cylin-
drical  rotor  coated  with  the  redox  oxide,  rotating  between  two
chambers where the reduction and oxidation reactions were con-
secutively  performed  ( Fig.  15 a).  Successive  hydrogen  production
was observed with CeO
4 coatings, ini-
tially under IR irradiation and on a scaled-up reactor version with
0.8CeO
2 tested under a solar simulator between 1473 and
1773 K,without sintering of the redox material. However, solid heat
recovery was still not realized and there are no reports on further
testing of the concept.

A  similar  rotary-type  solar  reactor  for  continuous  production
and  solid  heat  recovery  was  designed  by  the  group  of  UoM
[247] ( Fig. 15 b). It features a rotating hollow cylinder of porous re-
active material and a counter-rotating inert solid cylinder so that
solid  heat  recovery  could  be  realized  via  radiative  heat  transfer
between the two cylinders. Simulation results have predicted that
heat recovery over 50% could be attained [282] , but there are no

published  reports  on  manufacturing,  testing  and  performance  of
such a reactor.

A reactor with rotating solid parts, targeted to solid–solid heat
recovery, was developed between 2006 and 2012 by SNL [283,284] .
As  depicted  in  Fig.  15 c,  the  so-called  Counter-Rotating-Ring  Re-
ceiver/Reactor/Recuperator,  (abbreviated  as  CR5),  uses  a  stake  of
counter-rotating rings with fins made of redox materials. The fins
could be continuously transferred between the reduction and ox-
idation zones by means of rotating rings. Neighboring rings were
designed to rotate towards inverse directions and solid–solid heat
transfer could be realized through radiation. Pressures in two re-
action zones were maintained equal to minimize flow through the
recuperator sections [284] . On-sun tests of the CR5 reactor were
implemented  with  thin  CeO
2  fins.  A  practical  test  showed  that
the  two  sides  are  distinct  from  one  another  while  some  degree
2  at re-
of mixing did occur. Continuous production of CO and O
duction temperatures between 1723 and 1893 K, has been demon-
strated  with  4  and  8  ceria-finned  rotating  rings  and  the  high-
est  average  efficiency  of  0.66%  was  obtained  for  the  latter  case
[285] . However during the testing of a scaled-up version with 22

8.2. Reactors with stationary redox oxide material

Such reactors are designed to perform both cycle steps during
on-sun operation but different concepts are implemented for this
goal. Compared to the moving bed reactors discussed above, trans-
ferring  of  solid  materials  between  two  chambers  is  not  needed,
thus the mechanical energy consumption and technical difficulty
associated  with  the  high  temperature  moving  parts  are  avoided,
but, on the other hand, opportunities for solid heat recuperation
are limited.

8.2.1. Honeycomb/foam reactors

Such  reactors  stem  from  the  traditional  gas–solid  catalytic
chemical  reactor  engineering  where  ceramic  porous  supports  –
honeycombs or foams - chemically inert with respect to the tar-
geted  reactions,  are  coated  with  a  catalyst  material  capable  of
catalyzing them. Such honeycomb reactors were first coined and
tested in concentrated solar energy-aided chemistry applications in
2 methane reforming at Weizmann Institute of
1989 for catalytic CO
Science (WIS), Israel [286] . Eventually such reactors for the same
application employing Rh-coated SiC ceramic foams developed by
SNL and DLR [287] were the first structured reactors to be scaled-
up to the 400 kW e level and tested on real solar thermal concen-
tration facilities [288] . However structured reactors have not been
used  for  solar-aided  WS/CDS  via  redox  oxides  until  2006,  when
a  honeycomb  reactor  for  solar  fuel  production  was  proposed  by
the research group from APTL, Greece and developed, studied and
optimized  together  with  DLR,  Germany  [53,289]  in  the  series  of
the so-called HYDROSOL projects. As depicted in Fig. 16 a, the re-
actor  used  solar-radiation-absorbing  multi-channeled  honeycomb
volumetric receivers employed in air-operated solar tower power
plants made of silicon carbide (SiC), structurally similar to a vehicle
exhaust after-treatment device. The redox reagent powders were
coated on the honeycomb supports and exposed to concentrated
solar radiation entering the reactor through a quartz window. The
ceramic  multi-channeled  monolithic  honeycomb  was  considered
to  offer  advantages  such  as  solar  irradiation  absorption  capabil-
ity, good gas–solid contact, low pressure drop, good mass trans-
fer and ease of product separation. Obviously, as with other types
of reactors discussed above, continuous hydrogen production can-
not  be  realized  with  a  single-chamber  reactor.  A  modular  dual-
chamber reactor was thus fabricated for quasi-continuous produc-
tion, allocating one chamber for reduction and the other for oxida-
tion through controlling/switching the sweeping gas and solar ir-
radiation level [290] ( Fig. 16 b). Such a ferrite-coated, dual-chamber
honeycomb reactor was scaled to the 100 kW level and tested on
the solar tower facility of Plataforma Solar de Almeria/PSA, Spain
2 O
( Fig. 16 c) for continuous solar hydrogen production through H
splitting [291,292] .

Further research on redox solar reactors in Europe, Japan and
Korea [293] followed for some time this direction of coating re-
dox oxide materials upon redox-inert ceramic supports capable of
developing  the  temperatures  required  for  the  thermal  reduction
step when irradiated. However, the experiences gleaned from the
various research groups, converged to the point that possible side
reactions of the redox coating with the support material had an
adverse effect on the desired reactions. In parallel, two more fac-
tors were precluding such reactors from reaching high efficiencies:
first, as demonstrated by both experimental and simulation stud-
ies of the HYDROSOL consortium [292,294] , they suffered high re-
radiation losses due the large absorber frontal surface exposed at
this high temperature level needed for thermal reduction; second,
the mass of the redox-inert support not directly involved in the

reaction process, needed to be heated up to the reduction tem-
perature, was much more than that of the active material. To ad-
dress these issues, research efforts have been shifted, on the one
hand to reactor designs that would mitigate re-radiation losses. In
this perspective, a subsequent optimization of the HYDROSOL reac-
tor shape was carried out, resulting in a hemispherical cavity de-
sign coupled to a secondary concentrator at its entrance to ensure
that all radiation incident on the projected reactor surface is used
( Fig. 16 d), [295] .

On  the  other  hand  the  concept  of  manufacturing  a  self-
supported, shaped, porous structure – e.g. honeycomb or foam -
entirely  out  of  the  redox  oxide  if  possible,  instead  of  using  the
latter as a mere thin coating layer was set forth; evidently such
a  solution  would  introduce  into  the  reactor  only  the  mass  di-
rectly  associated  with  the  thermochemical  reaction  and  conse-
quently would result in higher volumetric product yields and en-
hanced efficiency. Along this path, the ETH/PSI group collaborating
initially with the group of Caltech, were the first to demonstrate
the operation of such a solar reactor with a porous receiver struc-
ture manufactured entirely from the redox oxide - ceria in the par-
ticular case. Fig. 17 a shows the relevant 4 kW
th  receiver/ reactor
developed, based on ceria-made reticulated porous ceramic (RPC)
foams.

Taking into account the target of minimizing re-radiation losses
as  well,  the  reactor  consists  of  a  cylindrical  cavity  of  102 mm
both inner diameter and length, with a 40 mm-diameter aperture.
The  cavity  is  complemented  with  a  highly-reflective  compound
parabolic concentrator (CPC) at the aperture and closed by a 3 mm-
thick quartz window. Reacting gases flow into the cavity from the
radial inlets and the product gases flow out from an axial outlet at
the bottom [161,180,197,297] .

Actually, this case is an instructive example of how the mor-
phology and structure of the redox material used in a directly ir-
radiated reactor affect the radiative properties which in turn, can
have a crucial impact on the material heating rate and the unifor-
mity of temperature distribution. The reactor was tested with a se-
ries of ceria structures starting from porous monolithic pure ceria
cylinders (porosity 80%, pores at μm scale) [161] and porous ce-
ria felt (96% porosity) [197] . 10 WS/CDS cycles were demonstrated
showing stable fuel productivity  with the reduction temperature
equal or above 1773 K with a solar-to-fuel efficiency of 0.7–0.8%.
Efficiency was considered to be largely limited by the reactor con-
figuration [161] and it was improved in subsequent campaigns per-
forming only carbon dioxide splitting to 1.73% by employing retic-
ulated porous ceramic (RPC) foams made of pure CeO
2 , of dual-
scale  porosities  with  μm-  and  mm-scale  pores,  which  were  at-
tributed with advantages of volumetric radiative absorption, rapid
reaction rates and high reactive material loading mass [180,297] .
Indeed, compared to the CeO
2  monoliths and felts, the CO yield
was  significantly  improved  due  to  deeper  penetration  and  volu-
metric absorption of the solar irradiation facilitated by the mm-
scale  pores.  An  average  solar-to-fuel  efficiency  of  1.73%  was  ob-
tained, four times greater than the previously reported values, with
the tests extended eventually to 290 cycles [297,298] .

In  parallel,  the  reactor  structure  was  also  modeled  and  opti-
mized  based  on  heat  transfer  and  fluid  flow  analysis  [299] ,  in-
corporating  in  the  volume-averaged  governing  equations  effec-
tive transport properties of the dual-scale RPC ceria foams calcu-
lated via direct pore-level numerical simulations with the aid of
computed-tomography data [178] . In the updated version, the in-
ner diameter and length of the cylindrical cavity were adjusted to
100 mm and 75 mm respectively. Dual-scale RPC ceria with mm-
scale and μm-scale pores, was cycled between 1773 K and 1173 K
in an IR furnace for 500 consecutive carbon dioxide splitting cycles
demonstrating its long-term stability. Differentiating from the pre-
vious campaigns, a vacuum pump was adopted during the reduc-

environment; however still, a minimum purge inert gas flow was
required  to  govern  the  fluid  flow  field  under  vacuum  pressures.
The  solar-to-fuel  efficiency  was  improved  to  5.25%,  resulting  in

( p vacuum > 10 0 0 Pa) with a slight amount of inert gas and the oxi-
dation (under atmospheric pressure) in a transient mode between
1273 and 1023 K during cooldown from the reduction temperature
without irradiating the reactor [300] ( Fig. 17 b). Based on the exper-

imental results, the authors calculated the various heat loss contri-
butions and their percentage with respect to the total solar energy
input. The reaction enthalpy for the reduction of ceria amounted
to 8.8%, re-radiation losses to 9.5%, conduction (surface) heat loss
to 9.3%, attenuation by the window i.e. reflection and absorption
losses accounted for 6.6%, the energy penalty caused by vacuum
pumping  to  only  2.4%  and  the  energy  penalty  due  to  inert  gas
consumption to only 0.6% because of the low mass used during
the reduction step. In fact, this combination of mild vacuum and
sweep  gas  led  to  reduction  of  inert  gas  flow  rate  down  to  only
0.625 L (cid:2)min −1 compared to 7 L (cid:2)min −1 of Ar gas employed without
vacuum. The dominant irreversibility source was the heating of the
solid material during the switch from the oxidation to the reduc-
tion temperature, requiring 62.8% of the total solar energy input.
No attempt was undertaken to recover the sensible heat rejected
during the temperature-swing cycling.

Within the framework of the so-called SUN-TO-LIQUID project,
the reactor is currently under scale-up to the 50 kW-scale to be
integrated in a new, pre-commercial solar pilot plant in the facili-
ties of IMDEA, at Madrid, Spain, producing liquid fuels via Fischer–
Tropsch synthesis of solar-produced syngas. At this stage, a single
reactor is foreseen that will be producing oxygen and syngas se-
quentially. Design improvements concern both the solar field and
the  solar  reactor.  The  former  ( Fig.  17 c,  d),  employs  customized
small-size heliostats in a compact assembly, being capable of de-
livering an average flux above 2500 kW (cid:2)m −2 enabled by the devel-
opment of focusing mirrors with short focal length [301,302] . The
latter will make use of a secondary concentrator, a conical cavity
to achieve a more even flux distribution on the ceria RPC and mit-
igate as possible any hot spots, an improved flow pattern of the
purge  gas  to  prevent  backflow  through  the  aperture  and  a  bet-
ter loading ratio of the cavity [303] . More refined models for the
50 kW reactor are developed to improve upon the efficiency via e.g.
introduction of large-size pores (of the order of mm) in the foams’
structure and alternative designs to improve redox material heat-
ing uniformity. The group foresees that with such measures the ef-
ficiency can be increased to the range 10–15% [304] .

Similar design modifications were set forth in the continuation
of the HYDROSOL projects targeted to technology scale-up, demon-
stration under relevant environment and on-site hydrogen produc-
tion > 3 kg/week; in addition to the cavity configuration and the
secondary concentrator already mentioned, the concept of manu-
facturing the porous receiver/reactor building block elements en-
tirely of the redox material was also pursued. As in the case of the
ETH  reactor,  the honeycombs  were replaced by  foams, since the
latter allow penetration of the sunrays deeper inside the porous
structure and thus enhance heat transfer and mitigate the gener-
ation of hot spots [305] . To this end, a scaled-up version of the
concept to the 750 kW level was implemented by building three
reactors and installing them on two floors of the PSA solar tower
( Fig. 18 ). This configuration was deemed necessary taking into ac-
count  the  slower  kinetics  of  the  reduction  step  vs.  that  of  the
oxidation; thus three single-cavity reactors rather than two were
needed, with two of them scheduled to perform the thermal re-
duction step while simultaneously the third would be producing
hydrogen, realizing hence a quasi-continuous hydrogen production
mode. To further reduce the radiation losses emitted from the ab-
sorber to the environment, the initial hemispherical absorber de-
sign  was  eventually  replaced  with  a  domed,  elliptical  one  com-
prised of a tilted inlet ring and a concave outlet region, as already
successfully developed and tested by DLR in previous projects on
solar-driven methane reforming [306,307] . The maximum diameter
is 1100 mm and the length ∼1500 mm without the secondary con-
centrator (CPC) and ∼2450 mm with it ( Fig. 18 d). The window has
a dome shape with a diameter of 652 mm. Due to the large size of
the whole construction it was not possible to manufacture all the

foam pieces needed from the redox material, nickel ferrite or ceria
in the particular case. Thus the final solution adopted was that of a
hybrid "all redox"-coated – either with ceria or with ferrites - zir-
conia foams approach, incorporating eventually more than 100 kg
of redox oxides in total [305] .

The reactors have been tested at PSA with respect to hydrogen
production, but relevant results have not been published yet. The
third of the reactors above, including only ceria as the redox ox-
ide material is shown in Fig. 18 e, next to the Synlight ® solar sim-
ulator facilities at DLR; Fig. 18 f, g of the cavity are taken before
switching on the solar simulator flux and when irradiated therein
with 150 kW, reaching a temperature greater than 1373 K, respec-
tively, to indicate the color change of the material upon irradiation
and warn about the hence expected alteration of optical properties,
needing to be taken into account.

8.2.2. Membrane reactors

The operation principle of a single module in the case of CO
2
splitting is depicted schematically in Fig. 19 a [207] . As with the
other  solar  reactor  types,  the  first  studies  were  targeted  on  the
thermodynamic evaluation of solar redox membrane reactors and
calculation  of  their  potential  efficiency.  Employing  a  plug-flow
reactor  model  on  a  La–Sr–Co–Fe  perovskite  material  for  pump-
assisted and methane-assisted scenarios, a solar-to-fuel efficiency
of 2.9%, equal to that of isothermal solar thermochemical cycling,
was calculated for the former case at 1773 K, whereas the latter at-
tained much higher efficiencies at much lower temperatures - 63%
around 1173 K due to the much improved thermodynamic driving
force resulting from partial oxidation of methane [232] . Studies of
the  Chinese  group  of  the  present  authors  on  a  ceria  membrane
reactor for CO
2  splitting concluded that for a system using inert
gas, gas heat recovery is the determining factor for energy conver-
sion efficiency. The energy efficiency was calculated to be > 10% at
1800 K when the oxygen pressure at the inlet of reduction zone is
lower than 10 −6 MPa. In contrast, when the low oxygen pressure in
the reduction zone was simulated by vacuum, efficiency was calcu-
lated > 35% at the same temperature and oxygen partial pressure
conditions. The diffusion rate of oxygen ions in the membrane was
proved to be fast enough for converting considerable amount of
CO

2 within several meters [207] .
Operation of a solar membrane reactor was only recently exper-
imentally demonstrated by the ETH group ( Fig. 19 b). Gas-tight ce-
ria tubes (outer diameter 5–6 mm, inner diameter 4–5 mm, length
150–250 mm)  were  fabricated  and  tested  for  CO
2  splitting  in  a
solar cavity receiver containing one such capped module coaxial
to  an  outer  alumina  tube  (in  fact  the  configuration  is  the  same
with that of the aerosol reactor of the same group described in
Section  8.1.1 ;  the  reader  can  notice  the  similarity  and  transition
from Fig. 12 a to Fig. 19 b where the moving redox ceria particles
have  been  essentially  replaced  by  a  ceria  stationary  membrane
module. Operation at 1873 K, 3 × 10 −6 bar p
O2 and 3500 suns radi-
ation, yielded total selectivity of CO
2 to CO with a conversion rate
of  0.024  mmol (cid:2)s −1  per  cm 2  membrane  [308] .  Efficiency  calcula-
tions reported a theoretical limit exceeding 40% at 1873 K but the
measured value in this proof-of-concept prototype was less than
1% because no attempt was made to optimize the design.

2 /H

In the thermodynamic evaluation of the membrane reactor em-
ploying a countercurrent flow of CO
2 O and inert gas, thermo-
dynamic equilibrium was assumed at both the inlet and outlet in
all studies above [207,232,308] . However, a more recent study sug-
gested that the enforced assumption was unsound leading to effi-
ciency over-predictions [309] . The revised model identified that the
most dominating energy requirement is the penalty work require-
ment for sweep gas production, a higher inert gas demand and a
2 O conversion ratio. The maximum efficiencies for CO

co-current  flow  configurations  were  calculated  at  3.2%  and  2.0%,
O2  =  10 −6 bar
respectively,  at  operating  temperature  of  1900 K,  p
and 95% gas heat recovery, higher than those for water splitting
due to the more favorable equilibrium thermodynamics of CDS for
the optimized case. Given these efficiency levels on the one hand
and the complications that may arise in water/carbon dioxide co-
splitting case due to the different favorability and optimums for
conversion of the two reactants on the other hand [310] , further
intensive R&D seems to be needed to effectively scale–up such re-
actors.

8.2.3. Stationary packed bed reactors

In parallel the UoM group shifted also from the rotating reactor
concept of Fig. 15 b to a non-moving one. They conceived, devel-
oped and tested an indirectly heated stationary packed bed reactor
for isothermal redox cycles, specifically designed to achieve effi-
cient heat recovery, [311] . As shown in Fig. 20 , ceria particles (of a
total mass of 3.2 kg) are packed in the annulus between two con-
centric alumina tubes; six such tubular reactive elements are lined
in a (347 mm long × 305 diameter) solar cavity receiver heated
by  concentrated  sunlight  through  a  42  diameter  aperture.  The
mm-sized porous ceria particles were selected among other mor-
phologies  (dense  particles,  porous  monoliths,  reticulated  porous
ceramic) to provide the best combination of properties: large sur-
face area ( ∼0.1 m 2 /g) for the heterogeneous reaction, rapid heat
transfer and low pressure drop; the particles were 75% porous and
the void fraction in the packed bed 45% [311] . The tube assemblies
extend beyond the solar cavity to the heat recovery section, where
the inner tube and the annulus are filled with alumina reticulated
porous ceramic (RPC) of 85 −90% porosity to enhance radiative and
conductive  heat  transfer  [312] .  Redox  reactions  could  be  accom-
plished in the prototype ∼4 kW solar reactor by alternating flows
of inert gas and CO
2 through the packed particles. Continuous fuel
production could be realized by controlling the materials in some
tubes to be under reduction while in other tubes to be under ox-
idation. Continuous CO production in over 45 cycles was experi-
mentally demonstrated [92,313] . The spatially and temporally av-
eraged steady-state temperature of the surfaces of the reactive el-
ements was ≈1743 K.

To  model  their  reactor  [314]  the  authors  employed  the
Arrhenius-based model of Bulfin et al. [124] , mentioned in the Ki-

d , C O

netics section for oxidation of ceria in oxygen atmosphere, after
rearranging  it  to  reduce  the  number  of  the  morphology  depen-
dent reaction rate parameters (pre-exponential factors) and includ-
ing the rate coefficient, A ox and k
2 , which were extracted from
previously conducted experiments [132] . Modeling studies showed
that gas heat recovery > 90% could be realized in the reactor, re-
sulting in considerable efficiency gains since gas heat loss is the
dominating heat loss for isothermal cycles [314] . Indeed, up to 95%
of the sensible heat of the process gases was recovered, as could
be substantiated by the temperature of the gases entering and ex-
iting the heat exchangers, ∼298 K and ∼413 K respectively, indicat-
ing that a large amount of thermal energy was maintained within
the reactor and cycled between incoming and outgoing gases dur-
ing operation. The recovered heat represents 12 kW that otherwise
would have to be provided by solar input [92] .

The group also performed calculations of the various heat loss
contributions, reporting that the surface heat loss via conduction
through  the  insulation  and  convection  through  the  windowless
cavity  summed  up  to  about  45%.  The  solar-to-fuel  efficiency  of
the  system  at  1750 K  was  calculated  to  be  1.64%  without  con-
sidering the energy costs of producing nitrogen, which was used
as sweeping gas during the reduction step. In accordance to the
group’s predictions [130] , the decisive impact of the inert gas was
also demonstrated during the experimental campaign. As a mat-
ter of fact, the work required to produce the inert gas (5 kW) was
more than the solar input (4.4 kW), rendering the efficiency as low
as 0.72% should this energy consumption for nitrogen production
have been included [92] .

The success of the reactor in gas heat recovery is instructive for
the design of recuperation structure in future systems. The system
is so far the only reactor reported with gas heat recovering parts
integral to the reactor. Being highly integrated does not leave much
place for further optimization. The low efficiency was attributed
by the authors to thermodynamic constraints of isothermal cycles,
which, hence, were suggested to be not attractive for future de-
velopment [92] . However, it should be noted that the reactor was
tested with inert gas for oxygen removal. The accompanying gas
heat loss and energy consumption for inert gas production greatly
reduced the overall efficiency. Considering that more efficient tech-
nologies for oxygen removal are under development, which may
potentially  enhance  the  reduction  extent  and  reduce  the  energy

cost, the isothermal cycling mode should be retained as one of the
future options.

9.1. Redox oxide pair materials

9. Current status of technology

From the analysis and the examples presented above, it should
be obvious that the three levels determining the solar-to fuel ef-
ficiency,  namely  materials,  reactor  type  and  operation  mode  are
close-coupled. Different heat losses are dominant for different re-
actor configurations, and even for different redox pair materials;
for example it has been argued that the system priority should be
given to high solid–solid heat recuperation for ceria and to high
gas–gas heat recuperation for perovskites [38] . In the sections be-
low the current and recent developments in each level are summa-
rized and the potential for further advances therein is addressed.

Despite their commonalities in operating in the partial reduc-
tion  mode,  each  redox  pair  material  family,  ferrites,  ceria,  per-
ovskites and hercynites, exhibits its own specific advantages and
drawbacks. Ceria is characterized by much faster gas splitting ki-
netics. Ferrites are, from a thermodynamic point of view preferable
than ceria since they exhibit a larger extent of non-stoichiometry
( δ)  within  a  lower  temperature  range.  Their  main  disadvantage
is progressive sintering and eventual deactivation with increasing
number  of  cycles;  however  this  phenomenon  seems  to  be  miti-
gated when they are dissolved in a second, more thermally stable
oxide phase as has been reported in the case of ZrO
2 [54] , yttria-
stabilized zirconia/YSZ [315,316] and, more recently, of MgO [317] ,
an approach that is considered to also enhance the redox utiliza-
tion of their Fe ions. Perovskites are characterized by high oxygen

yield  at  moderately  high  temperatures  but  also  by  “energy-
demanding” re-oxidation. The cation at the M site is usually re-
sponsible for the redox properties of perovskites. So far, the per-
ovskite  family  that  has  been  widely  studied  and  considered  as
good candidate materials comprises Lanthanum manganites [64–
70] , in which Mn 4 + /Mn 3 + ions are used for redox reactions. How-
ever, on the one hand, these perovskite materials have poor oxi-
dation performance and require a large amount of oxidizing gas,
which leads to significant increase of heat loss in the gas phase
[38,318] .  On  the  other  hand,  some  perovskite  materials  have  a
higher heat capacity and a higher molar mass than ceria [64,223] .
For  a  certain  temperature  swing  ( (cid:3)T)  between  two  steps,  the
higher  heat  capacity  of  such  perovskites  leads  to  a  higher  solid
sensible  heat  loss.  The  higher  molar  mass  means  that  the  fuel
yield  per  unit  mass  of  perovskite  does  not  increase  significantly
compared to that of ceria even under the premise of a significant
increase in the reduction extent. These poor oxidation thermody-
namics and the relatively higher specific heat of perovskites lead
to  higher  H
2  demand  and  energy  loss,  making  perovskites
unlikely to outperform ceria at high temperatures [38,318] . This is
mainly due to the fact that ceria shows a very high change in en-
tropy upon reduction, partially due to the unique electronic struc-
ture of the cerium atom [36,127] . Nevertheless, the thermodynamic
properties of perovskites, especially the enthalpy change upon re-
duction, can be tuned by changing their composition. Therefore, it
may be possible to find perovskites with comparable performance
to ceria (same overall heat-to-fuel efficiency) which can be reduced
at  lower  temperatures  (i.e.,  1673 K  instead  of  1773 K)  [319] .  This
would allow reaching these temperatures more easily in a practical
reactor setup and mediate the challenges in reactor design associ-
ated with very high temperatures. More extensive studies on the
redox performance of perovskites showed that the reduction dif-
ficulty of perovskites increases successively when Co, Fe, Mn and
Ti are employed as redox ions [36,320–322] . The oxygen affinity
of ceria is between that of Mn and Ti. Materials with more suit-
able thermodynamic properties than cerium oxide may be found
by fine-tuning the perovskites based on both Mn and Ti, or devel-
oping perovskites based on some other ions. The screening process
is still ongoing [319,323] .

Along the path of improving ceria itself, a lot of work over the
past decade has been devoted on doping it. Zr- and/or Hf-doped
ceria have exhibited significant improvement of reduction extent,
but at the expense of oxidation kinetics. The superiority of such
doped materials over pure ceria in scaled-up reactor versions still
needs to be verified in practice.

Some very recent alternative and potentially promising devel-
opments as far as the “materials screening” effort s have to be men-
tioned at the epilogue. Stemming from the already developed field
of High-Entropy Alloys for metallic materials [324] , the so-called
“entropy stabilized oxides” came recently into play [325] . In this
class of materials five or more elemental species are deliberately
incorporated into a single lattice with random occupancy, where
entropic  contributions  promote  thermodynamic  stability.  A  new,
stabilized  to  the  rocksalt  structure,  class  of  oxides  was  synthe-
sized by heating to 1373 K a starting equimolar mixture of MgO,
CoO, NiO, CuO and ZnO. This class of oxides denoted as (MgCoN-
iCuZn)O, was obtained via losing some oxygen to the environment
thereby making possible the reversible phase separation into the
rocksalt and tenorite phases upon cyclic cooling/heating. The idea
was applied to redox oxide-based water splitting materials through
the so-called poly-cation oxides [326] . Therein (FeMgCoNi)Ox com-
pounds have been recently reported to produce hydrogen via wa-
ter splitting at lower reduction temperatures ( < 1373 K) and with
higher  yields  than  ceria,  ferrites  and  several  perovskites,  by  not
having to undergo a complete transition to a single phase; instead
they contain a mixture of spinel and rocksalt phases whose frac-

tions  oscillate  during  cyclic  operation.  Obviously,  such  materials
need further scrutiny not only with respect to their underlying re-
dox mechanisms but as well as with respect to reproducibility and
stability under long-term cycling testing (e.g. hundreds of cycles).
It should be mentioned that a similar approach, i.e. multi-dopant
(quaternary) oxides has been proposed for ceria as well, by Zhao
et al. [64] who synthesized and tested a quaternary oxide of La,
Pr, Ce and Zr (LP-CZ) for two-step CDS [327] and conceptually by
Boshale et al., [328] . Materials that can be reduced at temperatures
lower than 1273 K can become a “game-changer” for the solar fu-
els technology. If such a reduction of temperature is achievable, the
kind and concept of solar reactors to be employed for that purpose
can also be altered. For instance, allothermal (indirectly heated) so-
lar reactors could also be considered under such a scenario, some-
thing that will simplify the whole concept and accelerate substan-
tially its potential for commercial exploitation. Future nuclear reac-
tors could also be coupled to such materials, as mentioned in the
Introduction.

9.2. Solar reactors

The practical implementation of effective heat recuperation dur-
ing the “temperature swing” between the already high TR temper-
atures and the WS ones (973–1273 K) to achieve reasonable effi-
ciencies, was and still is a major issue of concern. Despite the high
energy conversion efficiencies predicted as achievable for solar re-
actors from a wealth of thermodynamic modeling and simulation
studies ( Table 3 ), the efficiencies actually achieved experimentally
until now are much lower. There are several reasons for this dis-
crepancy. At the early stages many simulations depicted (partially)
idealized  situations  acknowledging  that  various  heat  loss  terms
were ignored. For example an efficiency of 65% was reported for
the ceria cycle [71] but by assuming e.g. 100% solid heat recuper-
ation which, as elucidated in the several actual reactor operation
cases referred to above, is far from reality and perhaps unattain-
able  by  practical  reactor  designs,  current  or  future  ones.  Other
studies have considered conduction losses through insulated reac-
tor walls negligible in scaled-up reactors [216] . As a result and, as
the authors themselves state [71] , such studies provide theoretical
thermodynamic efficiency maxima rather than efficiencies achiev-
able in practice. Progressively, efficiency calculations and simula-
tion studies did account for some non-ideality and heat losses e.g.
by introducing non-zero values of solid or gas heat loss coefficients
as shown in Table 3 ; very often, though, these values are some-
what arbitrarily reproduced from previous literature or reported to
be taken from cases where the conditions might not faithfully re-
flect the actual situation in a real solar redox reactor. For instance,
due to the high temperatures required in a solar reactor, such non-
ideal phenomena relevant to heat and mass exchange are ampli-
fied: heat losses become a substantial amount of the supplied heat
since high heat recovery rates cannot be implemented in practice,
the  consumption  of  inert  gas  during  thermal  reduction  and  the
relevant heat requirements are high, temperature inhomogeneities
along and across the mass of the material occur naturally, often
together with non-optimized gas–solid contact inside the reactors
reducing thus the amount of the gaseous products. In contrast, as
correctly pointed out by the UoC group

“...most of the efficiency calculations have used chemical equi-
librium  end-states  (if  not  simply  full  reaction  conversion)  for
their efficiency calculations not taking reaction rates, hold times
and transient operational states into account...”

[18] .

On  the  other  hand,  along  the  technology  development  path,
many solar reactors were set forth and tested with the major mo-
tivation to demonstrate the in-principle feasibility of a particular

40

concept even under  non-optimal design,  i.e.  without  introducing
measures  for  efficient  heat  recovery.  As  a  result  simulations  of-
ten describe in reality hypothetical reactors operating under con-
ditions/assumptions  that  are  extremely  difficult  to  be  material-
ized in practice, shifting essentially the burden and the severity of
counter-measures to mitigate efficiency losses to the reactor con-
structors. This discrepancy is particularly magnified in most such
modeling studies involving solid-phase heat recuperation between
redox-based  moving  parts  or  moving  particle  streams  achieved
at high temperatures and vacuum, conditions that have never so
far been successfully  realized in practice. The problem is not so
much with the temperature level itself. There are industrial reac-
tors with moving parts, like the cement production kilns, that op-
erate smoothly at such temperature levels. The major issue has to
do with the different atmospheres required for the two steps and
consequently, with the need of independent control of their atmo-
sphere while they exchange heat, obviously by some sort of seal-
ing between the two areas dedicated for reduction and oxidation.
The two states of the redox material, the oxidized and the reduced,
have to exchange heat between them without exchanging gas mass
(oxygen). Thus solid structures or particle streams have to move
between two regions without in parallel being possible for gases
to move between the same regions. Even though simulations have
predicted that such an operational scheme can be highly efficient,
there is no convincing plan for their implementation up to now in
real reactor systems that would not malfunction after some oper-
ation time. In practice none of the proposed and tested reactors
with moving structured parts from a “hotter” to a “colder” region
to enhance such recuperation has been successfully scaled-up so
far; mechanical vibrations, thermal expansion, rotating parts and
effective sealing at high temperatures have been proved difficult
to overcome and became fatal during prolonged operation caus-
ing eventual damage of reactor parts in all cases [285] . As a result,
such reactor concepts have not been advanced further experimen-
tally in the open literature since 2012.

In the same argumentation, concepts proposing the circulation
and  transport  of  hot  solid  particles  between  higher-  and  lower-
temperature reactor regions with the aid of mechanical parts [220] ,
sometimes  in  combination  with  vacuum  which  will  be  ensured
via in-situ sealing with beds of moving particles [329] , have not
been tested in a multi-cyclic mode at the required temperatures
yet.  Concepts  to  implement  them  in  large-scale  still  need  to  be
developed,  taking  especially  into  account  that  such  moving  “gas
sealing” particle streams are very prone to flow instabilities (solids
blockage or gas leakage through them) especially at high temper-
atures; thus their reliable operation for a long number of cycles
has to be demonstrated beyond any doubt. Similar arguments hold
for concepts of indirect heat transfer/recovery to the redox mate-
rial  (allothermal  heating)  recently  proposed  and  modeled  in  the
literature. The idea behind such concepts is to decouple the solar
receiver from the chemical reactor by solar-heating a heat trans-
fer fluid and using then the enthalpy of this fluid to heat the re-
dox material to the temperature level required for thermal reduc-
tion  away  from  the  solar  receiver  ( Fig.  1 e).  In  order  to  achieve
the high temperatures required for thermal reduction of ceria this
heat transfer fluid has to be either a moving stream of particles
[245,246] or a molten metal [330] . Such concepts have been in-
deed modeled and simulated for ceria as redox material, resulting
in high theoretical efficiencies potential, but relevant reactors have
not been yet materialized, operated and validated. This lack of pro-
longed field testing is also true with newer concepts such as the
combination  of  tubes-in-cavities  by  several  research  groups  em-
ploying either ceria or ferrites [331] in moving particles, station-
ary packed beds [92] or shaped into monolithic structures [331] .
Awaiting on-sun field demonstration of such reactors, it should be
borne in mind that measures targeted to mitigation of the heat re-

covery issue should not lead to more complex and practically non-
scalable engineering solutions and that “technically simpler” con-
cepts are in principle more attractive for large-scale implementa-
tion and demonstration of any technology. In most cases a “trade-
off” has to be made between theoretical targets and operational
feasibility [49,92] .

With respect to the solar reactor type, successful, cyclic, long-
term  redox  operation  under  solar-irradiation  conditions  has  so
far been demonstrated only from reactors employing non-moving
porous structures manufactured to the highest possible extent out
of the redox oxides. Technical solutions based on reactors without
high-temperature moving parts offer the easiest way to scale-up
beyond the lab-scale level and, indeed such reactors have been re-
cently scaled to 50 kW by the ETH research group [302,304] and
to 750 kW by APTL-DLR [305] . Naturally, such reactors are inher-
ently of limited efficiency since they cannot implement effectively
– at least at first glance - solid phase heat recuperation, thus for
the time being they integrate efficient schemes of (only) gas-phase
heat recovery through heat exchange with porous solids. Further-
more,  there  are  several  critical  issues  relevant  to  further  scale-
up  of  such  reactors.  Even  though  it  is  true  that  the  volume-to-
external-surface  ratio  increases  with  increasing  reactor  size  and
this favors the reduction of heat losses, the amount of redox ma-
terial that can be accommodated in the reactor is not proportional
to the reactor’s size, in other words the redox material cannot sim-
ply fill all the reactor volume. Layers of redox material beyond a
critical thickness, even though feasible via current standard man-
ufacturing practices, are not recommended; on the one hand the
optical density of ceria will not allow the penetration of solar ir-
radiation deep enough to the redox porous structure and thus not
all the redox material mass will reach the necessary and uniform
temperature needed for reduction. In addition, the reactor should
provide for homogeneous distribution of temperature as well as of
oxygen partial pressure within it. Given that a large volume will be
illuminated trough a small window, temperature inhomogeneities
between  the  well-  and  less-illuminated  regions  will  become  in-
evitable. Over-heating (e.g. close to the entrance) can cause subli-
mation of ceria whereas under-heating less non-stoichiometry ex-
tent and hence less hydrogen/carbon monoxide in the next step.
On the other hand as the dimension of the redox porous struc-
ture increases, gradients of oxygen concentration may occur and
gas  phase  mass  transfer  may  become  the  rate-limiting  step,  as
predicted  by  numerically  solving  the  volume-averaged  mass  and
energy  conservation  equations  describing  the  coupled  transport
and chemical processes [332] . So far high-temperature thermal re-
duction processes are modeled as depending solely on tempera-
ture  and  considered  to  be  heat  transfer  limited;  an  assumption
true until a critical reactor scale. Beyond such a scale factors like
gas phase oxygen transport and removal can become the limiting
step.

9.3. Operating strategy

The major categorization between operational strategies is that
between  temperature-swing  and  isothermal  cycles,  already  dis-
cussed in several points so far. Certainly isothermal cycles may dra-
matically simplify the reactor configuration due to elimination of
the need for solid heat recovery, which is deemed necessary for
non-isothermal cycles but difficult to realize technically. However,
such cycles are challenged thermodynamically [216] , and still, as
was described in detail for the UoM reactor, do not seem yet capa-
ble of demonstrating high efficiencies under real solar-testing con-
ditions, despite the fact that 95% of the sensible heat of nitrogen
(N
2 ) were
recovered therein. Nevertheless, the success of the reactor in gas
heat recovery by engineering a simple and effective ceramic sleeve

heat exchanger can be highly instructive for the design of recuper-
ation structures integrated in other reactor concepts.

As  far  as  temperature-swing  cycles  implemented  on  non-
moving porous structured reactors, different modes of solar reac-
tor operation have been proposed to further improve upon their
solar-to-fuel  efficiency.  A  recently  coined  approach  is  to  operate
in a temperature swing mode but performing the oxidation and/or
the reduction step in non-isothermal operation, i.e. not by dwelling
at  a  particular  temperature  but  in  a  transient  mode  during  the
cool-down and heat-up steps. This approach of non-isothermal ox-
idation  was  first  conceptually  proposed  for  ferrites  as  the  redox
material [184] . An exemplary case presuming that a WS cycle is
run  between  1673  and  1373 K  was  described  therein  as  follows:
after  the  completion  of  an  isothermal  reduction  step  at  the  up-
per temperature level, while the temperature is linearly decreased,
at some point (e.g. when T = 1573 K) steam is introduced; as soon
as the temperature reaches the lowest level (1372 K) the tempera-
ture rises again while keeping the steam flow constant, up to1573
K. Then, the steam flow is cut-off and switched to inert gas, the
temperature is risen to 1400 °C and kept there for a specific time
to perform the reduction; thereafter the process can start again.
In this mode splitting is performed non-isothermally during cool-
down and heat-up from 1573 to 1373 K. The maximum tempera-
ture of the non-isothermal splitting is imposed by the tempera-
ture at which no oxygen is evolved during the splitting step, cal-
culated for the specific TR reaction equations at 1573 K. With such
an approach, the amount of hydrogen that could be produced is al-
most double than that produced via isothermal splitting during the
same  timeframe.  A  similar  experimental  approach  was  followed
subsequently  by  the  ETH  group  in  their  ceria-foam  reactor  con-
verting CO
2 to CO: after reduction performed at 1773 K under vac-
uum (10 mbar) accompanied by a minimum purge inert gas flow,
the oxidation reaction was implemented in a transient mode be-
tween 1273 and 1023 K during cooldown from the reduction tem-
perature without irradiating the reactor [300] , increasing thus its
efficiency to 5.25%, both by increasing the numerator and decreas-
ing the denominator of Eq. (6) . This example also shows that in
practice, equilibrium conditions may be not favorable in maximiz-
ing solar reactors’ efficiency and productivity. This value of 5.25%
is the highest solar-to-fuel efficiency value reported so far for so-
lar  redox  oxide  reactors.  The  rather  low  value  is  mainly  due  to
the inability of the reactor to recover the solid heat loss that ac-
counted for 62.8% of the total energy input, being the dominant
energy loss source. To further improve upon it, the group is ex-
ploring a subsystem for energy storage and heat transfer via the
introduction of two energy storage units and heat transfer fluids
working between them and the reactor, to recover part of this heat
[300,333] .

In summary, several measures can contribute in closing the gap
between  predicted  and  actual  efficiencies.  One  should  try  to  in-
clude kinetics, parameters and conversions obtained from experi-
mental data in simulations, in particular from solar reactors where
possible. Even though it is understandable that such calculations
cannot be extrapolated and generalized to other, completely dif-
ferent reactor concepts, they will nevertheless help in predicting
more accurately the performance and the limits of the actual sys-
tem under investigation. Transient and far-from-equilibrium oper-
ational schemes should also be modeled and simulated, in close
relevance with actual reactors real operation.

9.4. Ceria redox cycle efficiency vs. those of other relevant
technologies

Solar-to-fuel efficiency is of particular concern since it is one of
the decisive indicators of the commercial prospect of the solar fuel
technologies. Other solar fuel production routes, such as artificial

photosynthesis [334,335] , PV (photovoltaic)-electricity-driven elec-
trolysis  [336] ,  photo-electrochemical  cells  [337,338]  etc.,  are  also
being pursued worldwide. The main emerging commercial technol-
ogy in this “green” space is that of electrolysis powered by renew-
able or carbon-neutral electricity (e.g., wind, solar, hydro, geother-
mal, nuclear). With respect to solar technologies, PV-driven elec-
trolysis  seems  to  be  a  commercially  deployable  approach,  since
both PV power generation and alkaline water electrolysis are al-
ready commercialized technologies [336,339,340] . A fact in favor
of this approach is that a significant reduction in the solar elec-
tricity  cost  has  taken  place  during  the  last  years.  Based  on  the
auction prices in 2017 and 2018, the outlook for solar electricity
prices to 2020 presages the lowest yet seen for PV (as well as for
CSP) modular technologies. However, particularly for the PV case,
rapid declines in installed costs and increased capacity factors have
improved  the  economic  competitiveness  of  solar  PV  around  the
world: at the level of currently reached Levelized Cost of Electricity
(LCOE) - below USD 0.030/kWh - solar PV generated electricity is
competing head-to-head with fossil fuel power sources in many lo-
cations, without financial support [341] . Thus, hydrogen produced
by water electrolysis from excess renewable energy becomes a very
attractive approach, the commercialization of which, though, has
its own problems.

The maximum solar-to-fuel efficiency of PV-electrolysis is the
product of the efficiencies of PV and electrolysis systems. In this
respect, commercialization is limited by the inefficient process of
first converting incident solar radiation to electricity (its efficiency
being less than 20% depending on renewable source). When cou-
pled to the inherent electrolyzer operating efficiency ( ∼70%), the
overall efficiency is predicted to be 11–16% (annual averaged effi-
ciency) without considering mismatch between them [87,334,336] .
Compared to that on absolute terms, the currently achieved over-
all solar energy conversion efficiency of 5.25% for concentrated so-
lar energy-powered redox oxide cycles reported above, is still not
high enough, despite the fact that solar thermal chemical pathways
are theoretically more efficient because they utilize the entire so-
lar spectrum as process heat (as opposed to selective absorption by
PVs). Certainly, more work needs to be done to bring about techno-
logical breakthroughs and promote commercialization of the redox
oxides-based solar fuels production technology.

However, this last issue of mismatch between solar PV and elec-
trolysis mentioned above is currently a critical one for the partic-
ular approach. The inherent fluctuation, intermittence and conse-
quent supply variability in renewable sources of power and inef-
ficient conversion technologies pose barriers to coupling and inte-
grating this renewable solar PV electricity to large-scale water elec-
trolysis. When performed with the aid of solar energy, these “so-
lar fuels” chemical synthesis processes face the challenge of con-
tinuous, round-the-clock operation. In other words, in direct anal-
ogy to “conventional” large-scale chemical plants any “solar plant”
should  be  able  to  operate  not  only  under  temporary  fluctuation
of the available solar radiation (e.g. caused by clouds), but essen-
tially overnight, avoiding a diurnal rhythm of start-up and shutting
down the plant that causes significant losses in efficiency and se-
vere degradation of materials and components. The only way to do
so is to store some of the solar energy available during the day
and exploit it to perform the endothermic reaction steps off-sun.
In other words, the solar fuels chemical synthesis sub-system has
to operate in conjunction with the solar energy storage one. PVs
need a multi-Megawatt Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) to
store the excess electricity produced during on-sun operation and
release  it  to  the  grid  when  sun  is  not  available  or  on  peak  de-
mand (and prices); such battery storage systems offering an oper-
ational reliability > 10 years and are not yet commercially available
at competitive costs [342] . Hence, PV-driven electrolysis technolo-
gies are completely reliant on electric grid integration.

42

On the contrary, the inherent storage capability of solar thermal
plants via the unique advantage of intermediate conversion of solar
power into heat not only allows for this storage opportunity, but,
furthermore, provides for options of storing (all or part of) this en-
ergy into a plethora of different storage media and exploit strate-
gies spanning from sensible heat storage, storage via cyclic phase
changes of suitable materials as well as in the form of reversible
chemical reactions (TCS) in conjunction with the solar fuels pro-
duction. These strategies can be mutually benefited from common
trends in materials screening, design and processing and by the ex-
ploitation of characteristics relevant to redox operation like materi-
als’ electric/ionic conductivity and sub-systems design commonali-
ties for most effective heat recuperation. In parallel to solar PV, CSP
costs have been also significantly declined. The 2017 global record-
low bid tariff for CSP plants with thermal energy storage (TES) of
USD 0.061/kWh [343] is strong evidence that commissioned CSP
plants with TES will increasingly be delivering electricity at a cost
within the lower end of the fossil fuel-fired cost range by 2020
establishing a secure position in the future solar energy mix. Fu-
ture solar concentration plants have the potential of co-generating
chemicals, heat, and electricity.  In this perspective, flexible solar
technologies with potential to decouple the collection of solar en-
ergy from the production of solar fuels via storage, are perhaps the
most important long-term goal.

10. Conclusions and outlook

In this work, we have reviewed the advances of two-step ther-
mochemical cycles performed with cerium-based oxides through-
out  the  solar  fuels  production  process  value  chain:  from  funda-
mental thermodynamic calculations on materials performance and
reactor  concept  efficiencies,  to  the  eventual  developing,  building
and operating cerium oxide-based solar reactors in pilot-scale level
to  demonstrate  the  technology  potential  for  further  commercial
deployment. The last decade has seen a lot of studies on this spe-
cific topic, giving profound insight both into the fundamentals of
redox reactions as well as to their potential in solar fuels produc-
tion and principles for system design and optimization.

In terms of material properties, the main drawback of ceria is
its higher difficulty in reduction. In the relevant solar fuel produc-
tion experiments, ceria was mostly reduced in inert gas at 1773 K,
corresponding to an oxygen non-stoichiometry of 0.04–0.06, which
is  just  ∼10%  of  the  maximum  stoichiometric  range.  Thermody-
namic considerations have shown that a material with lower re-
duction  enthalpy  and  higher  entropy  change  would  be  reduced
more easily, but this could also lead to drawbacks in oxidation ki-
netics due to a lower driving force, and to lower conversion extent.
Various doping strategies for ceria have been extensively studied,
with Zr and Hf having been proved to be very effective on improv-
ing the reduction extent. However, considering their poor oxida-
tion properties, which result in slower oxidation rate and higher
CO
2 O demand, it remains to be further verified whether their
performance could be better than that of pure ceria in practical
systems.  While  some  other  more  sophisticated  doping  strategies
may better balance the reduction and oxidation properties, there
does  not  seem  to  be  very  much  room  for  reduction  extent  im-
provement through doping.

The excellent stability and fast kinetics of ceria ensure a large
selection space for material morphology in practical systems. The
optimal material formation/ arrangement is closely related to the
system  characteristics  in  particular  to  the  heating  modes.  For
indirectly  heated  reactors,  closely  packed  particles  have  shown
good  reaction  performance,  whereas  for  directly-irradiated  sys-
tems,  structured  materials  are  required  in  which  it  is  of  crucial
importance to ensure a good volumetric absorption and uniform

heating to avoid surface overheating (which may cause sublima-
tion).

In  terms  of  the  reaction  system,  although  theoretical  predic-
tions show that the solar-to-fuel efficiency could be as high as >
50%, the heat losses in various heat transfer processes and work
costs of auxiliary systems make the actual system efficiency much
lower than the theoretical value, and these energy penalties must
not  be  omitted  when  calculating  efficiency  values.  The  optimal
operation  mode  lies  in  a  balance  between  solid-phase  and  gas-
phase heat requirements, since increasing the oxidation tempera-
ture could reduce or even eliminate the solid heat demand, but
could also increase the demand of CO
2 O in the oxidation step,
leading  to  a  higher  gas-phase  heat  demand.  Non-isothermal  cy-
cles with an optimized temperature swing are thermodynamically
preferable  than  isothermal  ones,  due  to  higher  fuel  productivity
and lower gas heat demand. In a non-isothermal cycle, the dom-
inating energy losses are from solid heating and oxygen removal.
Solid-phase  heat  recovery  and  efficient  oxygen  removal  are  still
challenging technologies, which deserve more research efforts in
the future. Technological breakthrough in one of them will reduce
the pressure on the other.

2 /H

Direct  recovery  of  the  solid-phase  heat  calls  for  solid–solid
heat transfer between solid materials from reduction and oxidation
chambers. Meanwhile, in order to drive the cycle, the gases from
two  chambers  should  not  be  mixed.  These  requirements  make
solid-phase heat recovery quite technically challenging. Although
direct solid–solid heat recovery has been included in several de-
signs, the corresponding experimental campaigns could not over-
come the inherent engineering complexities and their large-scale
feasibility is questionable.

With respect to the oxygen removal method, although employ-
ing a vacuum pump instead of inert sweeping has brought about
an improvement of system efficiency, the energy consumption of
commercial pumps is still much higher than the theoretical level,
due to their low efficiency, especially in the case of high vacuum, a
fact further limiting the improvement of redox materials’ reduction
extent. More efficient oxygen removal methods, for example ther-
mochemical oxygen pumps or more efficient mechanical vacuum
pumps, should also be the focus of future research.

Even under these limitations, though, higher solar-to-fuel effi-
ciencies  comparable  to  that  of  solar  PV-driven  electrolysis  could
be expected for this technology by introducing heat recovery and
scaling up, showing a promising prospect to produce liquid fuels
via a totally clean and renewable path. More work on the system
level, to reduce or even eliminate the energy losses, needs to be
performed in the view of its commercial realization.
