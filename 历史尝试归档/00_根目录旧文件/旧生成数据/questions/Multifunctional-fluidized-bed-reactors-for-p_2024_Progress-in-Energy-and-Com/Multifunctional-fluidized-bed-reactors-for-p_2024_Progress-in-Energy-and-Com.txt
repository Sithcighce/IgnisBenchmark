Fluidized bed reactors (FBRs) are crucial in the chemical industry, serving essential roles in gasoline production,
manufacturing materials, and waste treatment. However, traditional up-flow FBRs have limitations in applica-
tions where rapid kinetics, catalyst deactivation, sluggish mass/heat transfer processes, particle erosion or
agglomeration (clustering) occur. This review investigates multifunctional FBRs that can function in multiple
ways and intensify processes. These reactors can reduce reaction steps and costs, enhance heat and mass transfer,
make processes more compact, couple different phenomena, improve energy efficiency, operate in extreme
fluidized regimes, have augmented throughput, or solve problems inherited by traditional reactor configurations.
They address constraints associated with conventional counterparts and contribute to favorable energy, fuels,
and environmental footprints. These reactors can be classified as two-zone, vortex, and internal circulating FBRs,
with each concept summarized, including their advantages, disadvantages, process applicability, intensification,
visualization, and simulation work. This discussion also includes shared considerations for these reactor types,
along with perspectives on future advancements and opportunities for enhancing their performance.

1. Introduction

Since the emergence of the chemical industry, various reactor tech-
nologies have significantly influenced its expansion [1]. Reactor con-
figurations provide an environment to carry out chemical reactions [2],
including catalytic and non-catalytic processes, influencing the devel-
opment of the industry. In this review, we focus on catalytic processes,
which allow a wider variety of strategies for process intensification due
to the persistent pursuit of enhanced process efficiency and the trans-
formation towards a more sustainable chemical industry. However, the
applied reactor technology significantly impacts the performance of the
catalyst. Packed bed reactors with a simple design and straightforward
construction suffer from pressure drop, hot or cold spots, catalyst
deactivation, and low stability. In contrast, fluidized bed reactors (FBRs)
allow the catalyst to behave as a fluid, solving most of these problems,
but are less commonly used on a laboratory scale because of their more
complex flow behavior. Packed bed reactors approach plug-flow
behavior more than other reactor types, making them more attractive
for catalytic kinetic studies. The development of fluidized bed

technology marked a milestone in industry development, such as the
first fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) unit, which went into operation in
1942 and eventually became the industry standard for gasoline pro-
duction [3]. This example and its application to ethylene polymerization
demonstrate the importance of FBRs in the current chemical industry.
Other examples include gasification, Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, chemi-
cal recycling [4], and numerous physical processes, such as particulate
material drying and coating [5].

In traditional up-flow FBRs, gas bubble properties—such as size,
shape, formation, upward velocity, and coalescence—are quantitatively
comparable to liquid ones. However, the fluid behavior of the bed allows
for continuous feed, removal of solids, and rigorous mixing, resulting in
a uniform temperature, even for highly exothermic or endothermic re-
actions. This also improves solid and fluid contact, enhancing heat and
mass transfer. Unfortunately, FBRs encounter design and operational
problems despite their versatility and operation in several fluidization
regimes [6,7]. Working at an industrial scale means FBRs often operate
in the bubbling or turbulent fluidization regime, which leads to
gas-bypass and particle entrainment issues for conventional FBRs.

Additionally, continued solid mixing produces fines through attrition [8,
9], and operating at high fluidization velocities causes fines elutriation
and entrainment [10–12]. Moreover, because of the rigorous mixing in
the bed, an FBR can be seen as a continuously stirred tank reactor with a
varying solid residence time distribution (RTD). For up-flow FBRs that
operate at high gas velocity and a diluted phase of solids (e.g., riser), the
most concerning limitations relate to particle erosion and cluster for-
mation, both causing an uneven contact time between the gas and the
solid, and less control of the reaction [13,14]. All these phenomena limit
the application of conventional FBRs for certain processes. For example,
traditional FBRs cannot operate for a long time on stream in processes
with fast catalyst deactivation, such as MTO or FCC processes [15–20].
Furthermore, if substantial mass or heat transfer restrictions exist, such
reactors provide low conversion and poor performance, such as in
biomass fast pyrolysis [21–24].

To address these challenges, numerous adjustments to conventional
processes have been implemented. The prevalent options involve
incorporating extra reactors either in a serial or parallel arrangement, as
seen in the FCC process or transferring the catalyst between diverse
reactors and fluidization regimes [25–27]. Alternatively, some strate-
gies, such as the MTG process, utilize the same reactor but shift between
reaction-regeneration cycles by altering the fluidization gas composition
from the process gas to an oxygen flow, facilitating the combustion of
coke deposited on the catalyst [28,29]. Recent alternatives focus on

[30–32]. Other methods include the addition of internals such as
membranes, baffles, or mechanical agitators to disrupt bubble formation
and improve gas-solid contact and gas flow development inside the bed
[6,33,34]. For highly endothermic or exothermic reactive systems, heat
transfer tubes can be suspended in the bed to additionally supply or
withdraw energy to or from the bed [5]. Recent trends driven by elec-
trification [35] aim to control the heating of the bed using induction
heating [36,37] and induce more uniform fluidization of the solid
through vibration [38,39] or electromagnetic fields [40–42]. These
methods trade off an increase in capital or operating expenses, energy
consumption, or specific catalyst properties for an increase in process
efficiency. However, they open up a new way to understand FBRs and
the insights and methods gained from these modifications contribute to
process intensification (PI). Process intensification principles can also be
used to design novel FBRs that allow for multifunctional and intensified
operation. For example, operating in the centrifugal field instead of the
gravitational field would be an example of intensified operation. Process
intensification aims to minimize the number of units in the plant design,
reduce costs, or simplify the overall process. Reactive distillation is one
of the most common examples of process intensification, as it integrates
a reactor and a distillation column in the same unit. PI can be imple-
mented at different scales (Fig. 1). An arbitrary classification based on
Van Gerven and Stankiewicz [43] could include industry, process, unit,
phase, and molecule. The industry scale considers the complete plant,
from the energy source to product storage. The process scale accounts
for each step, such as reaction or separation. The unit scale focuses on

the equipment comprising each process, such as a condenser, boiler,
reflux drum, or plate tower in a distillation column. The phase scale
considers the building blocks that make a unit work, while the molecular
scale accounts for the molecular behavior, mainly in reactive systems.
A common way to apply PI at every scale is by using multifunctional
systems. Among the wide variety of these systems, multifunctional re-
actors are of interest because they usually improve the most critical step
in the chemical industry. These reactors can function in more than one
way, and their design is strongly oriented to process intensification as
they can reduce reaction steps and cost, enhance heat and mass transfer,
make processes more compact, couple different phenomena, enhance
energy efficiency, operate in highly fluidized regimes, have augmented
throughput, or solve problems inherited by traditional reactor configu-
rations. These systems can be classified based on their objective (Fig. 2):
energy (heat supply or management), matter (mixing or separation),
process (reaction-regeneration), or a combination of them (e.g., Vortex
or multi-zone fluidized reactors).

Multifunctional reactors have been a topic of interest for over 30
years. However, since 2005, their attention has steadily increased. This
rise in attention could be attributed to the growing interest in process
intensification for chemical industry processes, which may arise from
the profitability of the processes, market trends, or environmental
concerns. Despite the broad definition of multifunctional reactors, it is
possible to use the previous classification to analyze statistics about
publications on this topic. Fig. 3 presents the number of publications in

the last three decades using Fig. 2 keywords.

Before the 2000s, there were only a small number of publications
related to reactor energy supply, management, or use. Although pho-
toreactors and energy-intensive systems have grown consistently in the
past 20 years, the attention to electrified reactors remained small until
2020. Research on multifunctional reactors that focus on mass transfer
or separation was conducted before the 90s, with approximately 30
publications per year. The interest in these systems increased rapidly in
the following years. Even though they have experienced fluctuations,
they have had an average of 70 publications per year since 2005. This
could be attributed to the interest in membrane reactors, which account
for more than 70 % of the total publications in this category. Reactors
focusing on a specific process are generally studied less than others,
probably because their operation is more complex and/or unique. Few
publications related to them were released until 2003, when they
experienced a small growth that eventually stabilized until 2020. Since
then, the attention to reactors capable of simultaneously carrying out
more than one process has sharply increased.

This article reviews three intensified, multifunctional FBR geome-
tries: the two-zone (TZFBR), vortex, and internal circulating FBR
(ICFBR) reactors. Each reactor is explained in terms of its concept, weak
and robust features, applicability, and simulation works. Additionally,
common considerations about these FBRs are summarized, and a
perspective of upcoming enhancements is presented. This review aims to
provide a comprehensive overview of these versatile systems across

various applications.

2. TZFBR

Although an earlier version of this reactor was proposed [44,45], it
was first tested on a laboratory scale at the University of Zaragoza [46].
The main advantage of this reactor is its capacity to carry out two re-
actions continuously at the same time, one in the upper zone and the
other in the lower zone [47–49] while maintaining a constant flow of
solid particles between them. The following sections describe its concept
and operation, its strong and weak points, how this technology can be
applied to some processes, several modifications to achieve new func-
tions or enhancements, and some visualization and simulation research.

2.1. Concept and functionality

As mentioned, the TZFBR can generate two distinct reaction envi-
ronments in a single vessel by feeding two streams with different com-
positions individually. This is an example of process intensification, as it
reduces equipment cost and required space [50]. The two zones are
formed by feeding one of the streams to the bottom part of the FBR and
the other to a point inside it. The gas bubbles formed in FBRs transport
the solid between zones, allowing it to reside in each zone for a while
[48,51,52]. A schematic representation of the conventional TZFBR is
shown in Fig. 4 (left). The TS-TZFBR (center) and TZFBR + MB (right)
are two modified versions of the conventional TZFBR.

Because the boundary between the two zones is not physical, the
optimal control of the reaction atmosphere in both zones depends on
managing the feeding, lower and upper reaction rates, and catalyst flow.
Sometimes, if the gas fed to the lower zone (typically an oxidation one)
is fully converted before reaching the interzone, an additional zone is
created where the oxidizing gas concentration is zero, resulting in no
reaction [47,49,53]. A similar situation can occur in the upper zone. In
such cases, the reactor can be called a multi-zone FBR (MZFBR).

The movement of particles from one zone to another is determined
by the fluidized behavior of the solid bed. Specifically, the best results
can be achieved if the fluidization regime is smooth or bubbling because
bubble formation and development allow for better control of the solid
upward-downward flow. To manage fluidization in each zone, it is
crucial to note that gases from the lower zone mix with those fed to the

upper zone. Therefore, the gas velocity in the upper zone is higher than
in the lower zone. To ensure good movement of solids through and
between both zones, it is recommended to operate slightly above the
minimum fluidization velocity in the lower zone with solids of type B in
Geldart’s classification. This is typically accompanied by a reduced ve-
locity (ur = usg/umf) greater than 1.5 and, ideally, a reduced velocity of at
least 1–2 greater in the upper zone [54–60]. However, ur must be
limited; high reduced velocities are not recommended because they can
result in undesired gas back-mixing between zones [48,61].

Gas distributors also play a crucial role in the reactor’s functionality
and can either improve or worsen the solid movement by altering the gas
flow through the bed. The most used distributor is a porous plate with a
smaller pore size than the solid particle’s diameter. However, the pores
of the gas distributor plate could be affected by temperature or coke
deposition, especially since the lower zone is often used to burn coke on
the catalyst at high temperatures. Controlling both parameters is
essential to prevent pore blockage and uneven gas distribution in the
lower zone. The gases are typically fed to the upper zone through a rod
inserted through the top plate of the reactor. Usually, the most suitable
shape for this gas injector is a rod with a T-shaped end (Fig. 4) or, in
some cases, one with more than two horizontal branches. The height at
which it is placed above the bed’s bottom is one of the most relevant
aspects, as it determines the division and height of both zones [46,62,
63]. To correctly set the upper feeding point, two aspects must be
considered. First, in processes with coke deactivation of the catalyst in
the upper reaction zone and regeneration through an oxygen flow in the
bottom zone, it is crucial to know about coke formation and combustion
rate per gram of catalyst. These factors could depend on experimental
conditions or catalytic behavior. However, it is essential to understand
that if the catalyst strongly tends to form coke, the system requires more
catalyst in the regeneration zone than in the reaction zone [54,64–66].
Second, it is necessary to ensure that the residence time of oxygen in the
lower zone is sufficient to achieve complete conversion and prevent a
decline in selectivity in the upper reaction zone, leading to an increase in
unwanted oxidation products and eliminating the risk of an explosion
[48,49,67].

2.2. Advantages and shortcomings

Using a TZFBR can offer several advantages over conventional FBRs.

the process

The most obvious advantage is its ability to regenerate the catalyst in the
lower zone while being deactivated in the upper zone. If the operating
parameters are well controlled, this feature can help reach a steady state
where coke formation and combustion rates are in equilibrium (net

deactivation rate close to zero), allowing the process to run for longer
times than those achievable in a conventional FBR [48,54,64,65,68].
However, achieving this goal may be challenging because some of the
parameters selected for the lower zone also influence the upper zone.

For example, a lower zone flow rate change will affect contact time,
bubble formation and development, and fluidization behavior. It will
also impact the upper zone because there is no physical separation be-
tween zones and both flows (the one introduced from the top and the
one raised from the bottom) mix in the interzone. This could result in the
oxidizing agent mixing with the reactant/product stream, leading to the
loss of valuable materials and the formation of dangerous explosive
mixtures [46,47,54]. Another relevant issue associated with having two
zones in the same catalyst bed is the back-mixing of gases. In an FBR, the
solid material dragged upwards by the bubble creates a counterflow of
solid moving downwards [52,62,69,70]. If the solid velocity downwards
exceeds the minimum fluidization velocity, it drags gas from the upper
zone to the lower zone, producing gas back-mixing. This phenomenon is
related to the mixing of solids, and it is crucial when reactors operate in
turbulent or fast fluidization regimes [71,72].

The isothermal behavior of both the upper and lower fluidized zones
is another relevant point, especially in highly exothermal reactions such
as catalytic oxidation. The TZFBR reduces the effect of hot spots, sharing
the heat generation in a larger mass of catalysts. In the TZFBR, the
amount of heat produced or removed is shared with both the reaction
and regeneration zones catalyst, contributing to a more efficient energy
transfer. Otherwise, if the upper reaction is endothermal (e.g., catalytic
dehydrogenation), the heat generation due to the regeneration could
make the global process autothermal by the movement of the catalyst,
which acts as a heat carrier [73–75]. However, this advantage can also
be considered a drawback because the individual temperature control in
both zones could be tricky since there is no physical separation between
them. Both the gases from the lower zone and the solid that acts as a heat
carrier end in the upper zone, exchanging heat through the whole bed.
This effect could be even worse, considering that the lower zone is
usually used to burn coke and regenerate the catalyst, which is favored
at high temperatures and is highly exothermal. However, strategies are
based on operating at different temperatures in each zone, such as using
two other heating/cooling systems or feeding reactants at different
temperatures [74,76].

Another advantage of the TZFBR configuration is that it frequently
enhances the targeted product selectivity relative to the traditional FBR
[47,57,66,77,78] at the same conversions. Nonetheless, this aspect
varies extensively depending on the process and catalyst employed, so
evaluating each catalyst and reaction is recommended. It is crucial to
remember that upper-zone products are diluted and may even react with
those from the lower zone in some instances.

Several reactions where this TZFBR technology has been applied are
shown in Fig. 5: the oxidative coupling of methane [46,77], oxidative
dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons [47,49,66,67,78], oxidation of
butane to maleic anhydride [62], oxidation of benzene to phenol [79],
and H2 purification by preferential oxidation of CO [80].

2.3.2. Solid as a heat carrier via coke

For processes where the catalyst deactivates due to coke deposition
on its surface, the TZFBR provides an opportunity to regenerate the
catalyst in the lower zone via an oxidizing agent such as O2 or CO2 after
deactivation in the upper zone, where the main reaction takes place.
Some of these reactions include methanol to hydrocarbons [54,57],
steam reforming of glycerol [64], methane [63] or ethanol [81],
methane aromatization [59,60,68], propane dehydrogenation [65,82],
glycerol dehydration to acrolein [83], dry reforming of biogas [50,55,
56,70], propane aromatization [84], and direct transformation of crude
oil to olefins [74]. It has also been used to upgrade gases from biomass
gasification [85], where the TZFBR combines the removal of tar from the
products with the steam reforming of hydrocarbons.

2.4. Intensified TZFBR designs

2.3. Applications of TZFBRs

The TZFBR has been proven to apply to several processes, as sum-
marized in Table 1. These processes can be divided into two categories:
(i) processes where the catalyst acts as an oxygen carrier and (ii) pro-
cesses where the catalyst is deactivated by coke.

2.3.1. Solid as an oxygen carrier

The TZFBR provides two zones where the solid can achieve other
oxidation states in these reactions. The desired reaction occurs in one
zone. Usually, the upper one and the solid is reduced by releasing oxy-
gen from its lattice. In the other zone, an oxidizing agent is fed to the
solid to recover its previous oxidized state and the capacity to perform
the upper reaction. In this way, the solid acts as an oxygen carrier,
transporting oxygen from the lower zone (oxidation zone) to the upper
zone (reduction zone). The difference with a conventional reactor, co-
feeding reactants, lies in the absence (or at least lowered concentra-
tion) of oxygen in the gas phase in the reaction zone. The solid provides
the oxygen required for the oxidation step, and this may change the
selectivity concerning the conventional operation with the co-feeding of
reactants.

Several modifications have been made to the original TZFBR design
to enhance its performance and increase the viability of the reactor for
other processes favoring their intensification. Some changes focus on
solving the problems above, removing limitations, or increasing the
desired product yield.

2.4.1. Oxygen substitution

As previously mentioned, a significant concern associated with using
the TZFBR is the explosion risk arising from the potential mixing of
oxidizing agents (typically oxygen) and reactants (commonly hydro-
carbons), as demonstrated in Fig. 6 for the oxidative coupling of
methane. These results indicate that a significant concentration of ox-
ygen is present with methane in the TZFBR point of the injection of the
latter.

This risk increases if reaction parameters are not carefully selected or
little information about the process is known. Even though it is easily
avoidable using suitable technical safety systems (e.g., oxygen sensors
and actuated flow cut-off valves), it could be one reason why this reactor
has yet to be implemented industrially. However, one advance made
with the TZFBR is replacing oxygen with another regenerative stream,
such as CO2, H2O [59,64,79,90,91] or even H2 [92,93]. At the same
operating conditions, O2 reacts faster with coke than CO2 or H2O [55,59,

8

D. Zapater et al.

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 105 (2024) 101176

64,68]. This difference could be related to the available oxygen that can
remove carbon and the strength of their bonds—also, the use of different
agents results in other regeneration products—. The applicability of CO2
or H2O as regenerative streams could decrease reactor performance in
processes where coke forms rapidly [54,58]. However, if coke forms at
low rates [55,57], slow regeneration could counteract this formation.

2.4.2. Two-section TZFBR

The TZFBR’s initial cylindrical design allows good movement of the
solid inside and between zones. However, the amount of gas required for
catalyst regeneration is usually smaller than the flow rate of the main
reactant. Excessive gas flow introduced in the upper section of a reactor
with a constant cross-section could cause catalyst elutriation and a
change from smooth or bubbling fluidization to a turbulent regime, fa-
voring gas back-mixing.

To reduce or even avoid this effect, a two-section cylindrical reactor
was proposed [51,52,68,74,86–88,94]. In this system, depicted in Fig. 4
(center), the transversal area of the upper zone is larger than in the lower
zone, and a higher gas volumetric flow rate may be introduced in the
upper zone. The physical change between reactor zones can be charac-
terized by a parameter α, which reflects the smoothness of the transition.
◦
A value of α close to 0
indicates an abrupt transition, leading to
defluidization issues where solid particles near the corner remain sta-
◦
tionary, creating a ’dead zone’. Conversely, when α approaches 90
, the
transition becomes smoother, significantly reducing or eliminating
defluidization (Fig. 7). Notably, defluidization is influenced by various
factors. Julian et al. explored this phenomenon through a combination
of simulation and visualization experiments, discovering that increasing
◦—considered a conservative threshold—along with the gas
α to over 80
flow rate and the size of catalyst particles, can effectively mitigate this
issue (Fig. 8) [51,52,68,86].

In addition to defluidization, modifying the reactor section between
zones could also produce channeling or slugging. Channeling could
develop under specific conditions, mainly related to low relative gas
velocities and particle-particle and particle-wall forces. This phenome-
non becomes significant when the ur in the upper section is insufficiently
high, preventing tiny bubbles from dragging particles upward to facili-
tate effective solid circulation. Conversely, slugging is particularly
relevant in narrow lab-scale reactors and is typically observed in systems
where the gas velocity is high in the lower zone but low in the upper
zone. This disparity in gas velocities between the two zones hampers the
mixing rate of solids, leading to slugging. However, this issue can be
mitigated by ensuring that the gas velocities in both zones are similar.
This concept of a multi-section fluidized bed is also applied to other
reactor designs, such as the diameter-transformed fluidized bed reactor
[95]. In this design, the reactor vessel is built with different sections to
modify the gas velocity and favor specific reactions over others (e.g.,
cracking or catalytic conversions in processes such as fluid catalytic
cracking or methanol to olefins).

2.4.3. TZFBR with membranes

One recent development in TZFBR technology has been its coupling
with membranes, as shown in Fig. 4 (right). Typically, membrane re-
actors achieve higher conversion and yield by removing one of the re-
action products, which helps shift the equilibrium towards the released
product. However, this improvement could increase coke formation [96,
97]. FBRs with selective membranes have already been proposed
[98–101], but its operation with the TZFBR allows for combining three
processes in one device: reaction, regeneration, and separation.

In the TZFBR + MB configuration, the TZFBR operates as previously
described. However, for effective functionality, the membrane must be
strategically positioned in the upper zone of the FBR, where the main
reaction occurs [55,82,88,89]. Within the TZFBR + MB system, the gas
permeation rate and membrane configuration emerge as critical pa-
rameters. The size of the bubbles ascending in the upper zone plays a
pivotal role in fluidization and the movement of solids. Extracting a high

product flow through the membrane could significantly lead to
defluidization in certain sections of the solid bed, such as near the
reactor wall or at the transition between zones, especially where the
relative gas velocity might fall below one [88,99].

However, the membrane configuration also influences performance.
For example, when the membrane is positioned as a vertical (or hori-
zontal) rod in the bed’s center, it promotes solids axial mixing. In
contrast, when integrated into the reactor wall, it provides a larger
permeation area for selective gas removal [88].

Unfortunately, one significant drawback of using membranes in FBRs
is their fragility, as they can be damaged by high temperatures, certain
chemical substances, or the attrition caused by the movement of the
catalyst. This poses a particular challenge for membranes with a thin
layer of active material on the side of the fluidized bed containing
moving solids. Despite some relevant advances in this area [102–105],
producing a selective and durable membrane that can operate effec-
tively for an extended period remains challenging.

2.5. TZFBR experimental studies for fluid dynamics

As the bubble evolution is crucial for suitable application and proper
reactor design of the TZFBR, we emphasized the experimental studies
regarding fluid dynamics in this section.

Visualization of the TZFBR is proven to improve understanding of
fluid dynamics. Combining two non-intrusive techniques, digital image
analysis (DIA) and particle image velocimetry (PIV), allowed for
studying fluid dynamics in a pseudo-2D TS-TZFBR with five different
transition angles and several solid particle types [52,86,87]. Experi-
mental findings revealed that the reactor geometry affects the average
equivalent bubble diameter, bubble velocity profiles, and particle cir-
culation between the two zones. Based on these findings, a
non-parametric correlation for predicting bubble size reduction as a
function of transition section angle, relative gas velocity, and particle
type was proposed. This correlation successfully predicted the experi-
mental bubble size evolution in a range of relative velocities. The same
visualization system was used to evaluate the hydrodynamic behavior in
the lower zone of the TZFBR, testing six different tube bank configura-
tions at several superficial gas velocities [51]. This assessment estimated
solid axial mixing and the effect of the internals on gas-solid mass
transfer. A five-staggered tube bundle configuration could reduce the
average bubble size by 30 % within the lower bed zone at the usual
TZFBR gas flow rate without significantly increasing the solids circula-
tion time.

2.6. TZFBR modeling studies

To characterize the complex features of the TZFBRs, simplifications
have been applied to develop various mathematical models to describe
the fluid dynamics and reaction kinetics. Computational fluid dynamics
is another useful way to understand the multi-phase phenomenon.

2.6.1. Mathematical model

After a detailed review [48] of ICFBR applications and the TZFBR,
efforts were made to develop a mathematical model for simulating FBR
with two zones [75]. These models aim to understand the system and
predict the effect of the primary process parameters. In the TZFBR, the
solid flows between both reaction zones through the bubble, wake, and
emulsion phases. The experimental data from a bench-scale plant serve
as the basis for understanding the reactor behaviors, which can be
adopted for further simulation with the fluid dynamic model and
appropriate kinetic models. The fluid dynamics in the TZFBR as a
bubbling bed, based on the description of the three-phase model (bub-
ble, wake, and emulsion), have been validated with experiments, and
the coupling of reaction kinetics leads to a better understanding of the
behavior of reactors and reactions. However, certain parameters, such as
the velocity of solid circulation and the oxidation state of the catalyst,

9

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 105 (2024) 101176

which cannot be experimentally determined, have proven to be among
the most crucial variables related to the reactor.

In similar research, other authors developed a mathematical model
for the dry-reforming methane across three different reactors, including
a TZFBR and a TZFBR + MB [70]. This model accounts for variables such
as methane conversion, H2 yield, H2 selectivity, and the H2/CO ratio,
along with their evolution over time-on-stream. The model’s predictions
indicate an improvement in stability when transitioning from a con-
ventional fluidized bed to a TZFBR and further enhancements in yield
when incorporating membranes into the TZFBR. Comparisons with
previous experimental results demonstrate the model accuracy in
accurately predicting the effects of varying operating conditions.

Modeling TZFBR is a complex task as it involves the composition
variation in the gas phase due to catalytic processes, as well as the
variation in the solid’s composition with height, either due to a change
in its oxidation state or a change in the concentration of coke deposited
on it. The mathematical modeling of the TZFBR reactor must include
both a proper fluid dynamic model and a kinetics model of the reactions
taking place in the reaction and regeneration zones of the bed (i.e.,
above and below the intermediate feeding point).

As previously mentioned, the mathematical modeling of the TZFBR’s
fluid dynamics follows the classical three-phase (bubble, emulsion, and
cloud) gas flow model by Kunii and Levenspiel [106]. In this model, gas
rises through the emulsion phase at the minimum fluidization velocity
(umf), while bubbles rise at a velocity (ub), carrying some solids upward
in their wake. Upon reaching the bed surface, these solids enter the
emulsion phase and descend. The fluid dynamic parameters that delin-
eate the interactions among these phases, including the bubble rise ve-
locity (ub), the gas exchange coefficient between the bubble and
emulsion (Kbe), the coefficient of solids exchange between wake and
emulsion (Kwe), and others [70], are intricately linked to the bubble size
(db).

In an initial approach, it is posited that the bubble size (db) remains
constant throughout the bed [53]. This study presupposes isothermal
conditions and a steady flow of solids within the bubbles, independent of
bed height (z). The model incorporates a gas exchange between the
bubble and emulsion phases as delineated by Davison and Harrison
[107], and a solid exchange between the wake and emulsion following
the model proposed by Chiba and Kobayashi [108]. This modeling
framework has been effectively employed in studying the oxidative
dehydrogenation of butane in a TZFBR. Notably, the model necessitates
two variables to describe the oxidation state of the solid at any given
point: one for a fraction of selective active centers and another for a
fraction of non-selective active centers, as per the Mars van Krevelen
dual kinetic model [109] for that reaction.

However, the fluid dynamics accuracy of the model is noticeably
improved when a variable bubble size with the bed height z [47] is
considered, for example, using the equations proposed by Mori and Wen
[110] that suppose an exponential growth of bubbles from an initial
diameter (dbo), according to equation (1).

db = dbm (cid:0) (dbm (cid:0) dbo)exp

(

)
(cid:0) 0.3z
Di

(1)

In a subsequent refinement, the assumption of a constant db was
reconsidered. A more robust model [75] incorporated the variation of db
with bed height (z), in line with the equation proposed by Horio and
Nonaka [111]. This consideration implies that both the bubble velocity
and the rate of solid flow rising in the wake phase (and descending in the
emulsion phase) change. Consequently, the mass balance for the solid
becomes more complex, necessitating the inclusion of a term to account
for the variation in flow rate, as detailed subsequently. The predictions
from this model showed strong agreement with experimental findings
on propane dehydrogenation and butane oxidation to maleic anhydride
in a TZFBR.
Apart

from these conventional considerations, a key point

in

modeling a TZFBR is properly describing the effect of the intermediate
feed entry at a height zf on both the bubble size db and phase distribu-
tions. As mentioned in section 2.2, bubble size and velocity are related to
gas backmixing and the possible formation of explosive mixtures. This
safety concern makes modeling the bubbles a key advancement with this
reactor because it allows us to know the limits to ensure a safe operation.
Although considering the db variation with bed position (z) marked a
significant advancement, it is important to note that the existing cor-
relations for bubble size versus height were not specifically devised for a
TZFBR. Addressing this gap, Julian et al. [86] introduced a novel cor-
relation based on experimental data from a TZFBR. This work led to the
estimation of db using the newly proposed JHM correlation. Notably
[70], applied this correlation within a reactor model for the dry
reforming of methane, considering systems both with and without
hydrogen-selective membranes. The correlation introduces an equation
(2), derived from an initial equation (1), for modeling the lower zone of
the bed beneath the feed entry (z < zf), typically referred to as the
regeneration zone.

For the upper zone of the bed, situated above the feed entry point (z
> zf), which is typically the reaction zone, equation (3) is applicable. It is
posited that the gas added at the feed entry point (zf) instantaneously
mixes with the gas stream emanating from the lower zone. Conse-
quently, this mixed gas is evenly distributed between the bubble and
emulsion phases. Such an assumption aligns more closely with experi-
mental observations [75] compared to the alternative hypothesis that
the introduced gas solely contributes to forming new bubbles.

Once the db at each bed height (z) is determined, the gas exchange
coefficients between the three phases (Kbe, Kbc, Kce) and the solid ex-
change coefficient (Kwe) between wake and emulsion can be accurately
estimated using the expressions provided by Kunii and Levenspiel [112],
or analogous methodologies. Similarly, conventional correlations can be
employed to calculate the volume fraction of the bed occupied by
bubbles (δ) [70,113].

Given the variation in bubble size and velocity with bed height, both
the value of δ and the distribution of gas flow between the bubble and
emulsion phases vary along the bed. Specifically, changes in the volu-
metric flow rate within the bubble phase necessitate a compensatory net
flow of gas or solid, either from the emulsion to the bubble-wake or in
the reverse direction. Consequently, a term to account for the transversal
flow—reflecting the movement of solids between the wake and emulsion
due to changing bubble properties—can be integrated into the model
[114,115], as outlined in equation (4):

To close the mathematical model of the TZFBR, it is essential to
incorporate the kinetic models for chemical reactions occurring within
both the gas and solid phases. These models should detail the reaction
kinetics by expressing the rate of reaction (ri,x) for compound i in phase x
(bubble, wake, or emulsion) as a function of its concentration and that of
other compounds within the same phase. Beyond the basic reaction ki-
netics, the model must also account for the kinetics of regeneration
processes or those involving catalyst reduction and oxidation, particu-
larly if the catalyst serves as an oxygen carrier. This includes, for
example, kinetic models for the combustion of coke (with O2) or its
gasification (with CO2), depending on the reactor configuration.

In a TZFBR, mass balances must be carried out for both the gas and
solid phases. For the solid phase, solid particles can rise with the bubbles
(in the wake and with the cloud accompanying the bubbles) and descend
in the emulsion phase. Therefore, it is necessary to consider mass bal-
ances for both gas and solid in the bubble phase, as well as in the
emulsion phase, and for the solid in the wake and emulsion. Considering
the fluid dynamic and kinetic models, mass balances in a non-steady-
state can be made in a differential reactor volume element with a
length ∂z. Thus, the continuity equation for compound i includes terms
such as accumulation, inputs, outputs, transfer, and reactions. Applying
the fluid dynamic properties previously stated, the resulting partial
differential equations for gas and solid and the different bed phases are
shown in equations (5)–(8). Furthermore, there is a balance of the
gaseous species at the point of feeding the reactants (z = zf).

2.6.2. Computational fluid dynamics model

A CFD study employing an Eulerian two-fluid approach was con-
ducted to simulate the hydrodynamics within a pseudo-2D TZFBR [87].
The model successfully predicted the characteristic bubble shrinkage
occurring in the transition section of the bed and the eventual emer-
gence of defluidized regions, as depicted in Fig. 9. Additionally, it
examined the impact of various TZFBR design features, such as the angle
of the transition section, the superficial gas velocity, and the placement
of the immersed gas distributor, on the hydrodynamic behavior. The

findings were compared with experimental data, showing reasonably
good agreement. This comparison was validated using the standard
Eulerian-Eulerian model for accurately simulating bubble hydrody-
namics within the TZFBR across a broad spectrum of operational
conditions.

The two-fluid model simulations applied the commercial CFD soft-
ware Ansys CFX and Fluent to the TZFBR with membranes to examine
the effect of gas extraction on fluid dynamic behavior. Simulated bubble
properties and bed dynamics were analyzed and compared among
different membrane reactor configurations, including reactor-wall and
immersed tubular membranes. The immersed tubular membranes’
configuration is the most suitable to enhance the gas-particle contact
and favor the solids’ axial mixing for in situ catalyst regeneration pur-
poses based on the solids’ holdup distribution at different fluidization
regimes and permeation fluxes. However, the reactor-wall membrane
configuration provides a greater permeation area for selective gas
removal and is preferred to enhance purification.

3. Vortex reactor

3.1. Concept and functionality

Gas-solid vortex reactors (GSVRs) are centripetally operated FBRs
achieved by injecting high-velocity gas in a circular shape where solids

12

are added and rotated along the perimeter. The rotation is influenced by
a radially inward drag force (typically a destabilizing force) and a
radially outward centrifugal force (considered stabilizing). This review
focuses on distinguishing the discussed reactors, known as rotating
fluidized beds in static geometry (RFB-SG), from other devices that
operate on a similar principle. Notably, these reactors lack mechanical
moving parts. However, a short global overview of two types of cen-
trifugal FBRs is given: the rotating fluidized bed and the stator-rotor
reactor.

3.1.1. Single and multiphase flow fundamentals

Several studies have provided the most accurate hydrodynamic
description of vortex reactors operating with single and two phases (gas-
solid) through computational-experimental effort [116]. Recently, the
validity of these flow phenomena has also been proven in gas-liquid
operations [117]. Fig. 10 pictorially represents all these phenomena.
Single-phase flow is characterized by the presence of near-wall jets
arriving from the inwardly swirling gas flow, along with counterflow
and backflow resulting from the near-wall interactions of these jets.
These flow characteristics are primarily responsible for more significant
pressure drops across the reactor as the gas flow undergoes multiple
rotations, sudden changes in the flow plane, and reduced cross-sectional
area before reaching the reactor outlet. The behavior of gas-only flow
adheres to the cyclostrophic balance, as captured by equation (9), which

Gas-solid flows are relatively straightforward as other flow features
are suppressed except for marginal backflow. This transition from single
to multiphase flow occurs through a transitional flow regime called
vortex suppression, achieved by feeding a minimum solid (or liquid) to
the gas flow. In addition to establishing a rotational solid flow, vortex
suppression also reduces the pressure drop through the reactor.

The gas flow behavior in gas-solid units differs substantially from the
single-phase flow. The average gas residence time does not change from
gas-only to gas-solid flows; only the gas residence time distribution is
altered [118]. Most of the momentum is transferred to solids, which
reduces the gas velocity by 70–80 % of its value in the gas-only flow
[118]. Upon exiting the solids bed in the freeboard, the gas will almost
immediately leave the unit via the central exhaust.

On the other hand, solids in the GSVU rotate under the action of
outward centrifugal force and inward drag force. Depending on the unit
geometry, gas flow rates, solids properties, etc., the range of minimum-
maximum solid capacities can vary considerably, with slugging, chan-
neling, and wobbling flow regimes [119] also observed, similar to those
of classical FBRs (see Fig. 11 for experimental images of these bed
behaviors).

Changes in gas flow rates and solids loading across these regimes
result in a change in local solids volume fractions and a variation of the
average azimuthal velocity of the solids bed in a vortex unit. However,
the overall behavior of gas and solids remains relatively the same; the
gas exits the unit from the freeboard without completing a turn, while
solids keep rotating along the inner slot wall of the unit. Gonzalez-
Quiroga [121] proposed that the aerodynamic response time of the
particles (τp in seconds; equation (10)) is an important parameter that
relates the particle physical properties to the solid bed-reactor outer wall
interactions, which, in turn, affects the solids’ azimuthal and radial
velocity. For instance, low τp indicates radial velocities and bed voidage
fluctuations, while a high value refers to a case of elevated solids-wall

friction and, therefore, lowered solid azimuthal velocity:

(10)

Based on equation (10), the azimuthal acceleration of solids between
the consecutive slots was defined and measured using the PIV technique,
as illustrated in Fig. 12.

Replacing the solids with liquids does not significantly alter the
phase dynamics. A highly dispersed, turbulent gas-liquid mixture is seen
rotating within the reactor, and the gas passes through this liquid "bed"
before exiting the reactor without completing a single rotation [122].
Liquid flow regimes can evolve through bubbling flow and annular flow,
(cid:0) 3 to
with a micromixing time recorded across these regimes from 10
(cid:0) 4 s [117]. Fluid velocities and liquid back-mixing exhibit their peak
10
intensities near the slot mouth, where the liquid behavior closely mimics
that of a CSTR, facilitating high mass transfer rates. Conversely, the gas
phase exhibits behavior akin to a PFR in the freeboard area and near the
exhaust. The average liquid residence time, inferred from the overall
phase holdup, is marginally greater than that of the gas phase, which
remains largely unaffected by changes in the liquid feed rate [122].
Similarly to solids, the liquid bed remains in a state of rotational fluid-
ization as long as gas flow into the reactor continues. It is noteworthy
that, akin to the entrainment of fines due to attrition, the exiting gas is
also likely to carry fine liquid droplets. Ouyang et al. captured this
behavior using a high-speed camera, as shown in Fig. 13.

3.1.2. Solid capacity of reactors

A fundamental aspect of vortex reactor operation is understanding its
minimum and maximum solids capacity. While seemingly straightfor-
ward, determining solids loading is intricately linked to several factors,
including gas flow rate, reactor dimensions, and the physical properties
of the solids. Friedle [123] synthesized correlations from a range of
published experimental data, offering a method to predict the opera-
tional solids capacity of a vortex reactor.

where λmax and λmin refer to the maximum and minimum solids capacity;
Rep,R is the particle Reynolds number based on superficial velocity, and S
is the swirl ratio.

These expressions can be used to determine the solids capacity of a
vortex reactor. It should be noted that an implicit assumption in these
laws is that the gas-solid flows are stable under the tested operating
conditions. Therefore, the minimum solids capacity refers to the solid
holdup at a steady state and fully established gas-solid flow in a vortex
reactor. By definition, this capacity is different (slightly higher) than the
vortex-breaking solids loading predicted by Kulkarni et al. [118]. The
latter can be estimated by considering the number of solids in a

3.2. Vortex reactor configurations

Although the concept of vortex reactors is general (i.e., FBRs that
operate centripetally by injecting a high-velocity gas in a circular shape
vessel), there are several configurations or operation modes to choose
depending on the application. These and their particularities are shown
in this section.

3.2.1. Gas-solid vortex reactor

A metered gas flow is sent to the reactor assembly through single or
multiple inlet gas pipes. Although a single gas inlet shows minor velocity
and pressure fluctuations [124], the number of channels is mainly
inconsequential to the overall flow stability inside the vortex reactor.
The gas brought by the inlet pipes is distributed over an annular space
called a jacket, designed to distribute the gas uniformly over the entire
circumference. The predominantly azimuthal flow direction is imparted
to the gas beyond the jacket using a slotted ring, one of the essential
geometrical features of the vortex devices. The slotted ring consists of IN
number of slots, each having a width of I0 mm and is angled at γ degrees
concerning the tangent to the main reactor. These geometrical features
accelerate the incoming gas from the jacket and enforce a strongly
tangential flow to establish in the reaction chamber, which is often
referred to as the reactor. The reactor has a cylindrical shape due to the
two closely spaced end-walls separated axially by H, marking the axial
length of the reactor. The resulting gas flow in the reactor (for gas-only
operation) is a strongly swirling flow that follows the laws of free-swirl
motion, and its velocity increases as the reactor radius decreases.
Finally, the gas exits via the central exhaust, which is positioned on
either (or both, in rare cases) end plates, depending on the application.
Fig. 14 shows an example of a vortex reactor from the literature [125].
In this developed gas flow in the reactor, solids are added pneu-
matically using a dedicated inlet positioned inside the reactor [126].
Solids are added against the adverse pressure gradients using a small
amount of purge gas that can be inert or the same as the main gas. The

fluidization gas transfers most of its momentum to the solids, which then
rotate along the outer wall of the reactor to form a rotating bed of solids
with a thickness of L mm inside the GSVRs. Because the gas experiences
reduced velocities after contact with the solids, it exits the reactor with a
little swirl through the central exhaust. A continuous gas feed is neces-
sary to maintain the solid continuous rotation. However, a constant
solids feed is optional since vortex reactors can operate equally effi-
ciently with a batch feed of solids. Denser solid beds rotating with a
higher width-to-height ratio can be sustained in vortex reactors
compared to traditional FBRs.

Notably, other designs conforming to the principle of rotating beds in
static geometry, such as TORBED and fluidized jet mills, also exist in the
literature. The latter has a design similar to that of the vortex reactor and
is commonly used in the pharmaceutical sector as a grinding mill uti-
lizing high momentum of incoming gas with continuous solid inlet and
outlet. For further details, readers are referred to the relevant literature
[127–129]. TORBED reactors also have a similar working principle to
the vortex reactor, achieving a toroidal circular movement of particles
through gas flowing through openings between stationary blades
beneath the solids bed. The key difference is that in the vortex reactor,
the gas flow direction is in the same plane as the solids, while it is
orthogonal in TORBEDs [130,131].

3.2.2. Rotating fluidized bed reactor (RFBR)

An RFBR is a centrifugal reactor in which a motor provides mo-
mentum to a cylindrical reactor. One of the advantages of operating in
such a dynamic geometry is the ability to independently control gas
velocity and rotational speeds. This independent adjustment not only
improves bed stability but also allows for higher solid loadings within
the RFB. However, the mechanical components in motion can lead to
vibrations and significant wear on seals. Fluidization in an RFB is pri-
marily achieved through reactor rotation, enabling operation at lower
gas flow rates compared to a traditional GSVR. This reduced gas-solid
mass ratio renders the RFBR particularly suitable for processes where
the gas phase does not participate in the reaction, such as in drying
operations and the powder coating of materials [132–134].

3.2.3. Stator-rotor reactor

This reactor generates a homogeneous and densely packed bed of
particles within a rotating reactor using momentum transfer from the
gas phase [121]. Unlike the GSVR, the momentum is not directly
imparted to the solid particles but rather to a series of angled blades
appended to the reactor. Through proper blade design, the energy effi-
ciency of the reactor improves compared to that of the GSVR. The
increased energy efficiency reduces the required gas-solid mass ratio for
sufficient fluidization. Therefore, the stator-rotor reactor has advantages
and disadvantages similar to the RFBR. Although no external motor is
needed for a stator-rotor reactor setup, available research uses an engine
to have more control over the rotating speed [121]. The stator-rotor
reactor is currently in the early stages of development, necessitating
extensive investigation both experimentally and in modeling to fully
realize and refine this innovative reactor design.

Table 2 shows the main differences between the rotating fluidized

bed and the stator-rotor vortex reactor designs.

3.3. Advantages and limitations

The introduction of centrifugal force enhances various flow phe-

nomena in vortex reactors, and the key ones are listed here.

1. Firstly, the slip velocities between gas and solid, which are otherwise
limited in gravitationally operated devices, can be increased by a few
orders of magnitude in the centrifugal field. The slip velocity is the
vector difference between the gas and solid velocities at any location
in the bed. In a vortex reactor, both contributions to slip velocities
are higher, thereby increasing the overall magnitude. This direct

effect is anticipated to significantly enhance inter- and intra-phase
heat and mass transfer [24,117]. In vortex reactors operating at
room temperature, solids (and liquids) have been observed to reach
(cid:0) 1, a phenomenon that is difficult to achieve in
velocities up to 10 m s
traditional reactors.

2. Secondly, the centrifugal force exerted on particles within vortex
reactors causes them to form a densely packed arrangement near the
outer wall. This compacted bed, rotating with the primary gas phase,
facilitates interactions between the gas and solids in a confined
space. The average volume fraction of solids in this environment can
reach 0.5–0.6 for spherical particles and potentially higher for
irregularly shaped solids, compared to the 0.2–0.3 typically seen in
conventional fluidized beds, depending on the operating regime.
3. Increasing the gas flow in vortex reactors leads to the stabilization of
solid beds, which is attributed to the enhanced centrifugal compo-
nents. This contrasts with FBRs, where increasing fluidization flow
eventually causes solid beds to entrain.

4. The formation of closely packed beds, alongside higher slip velocities
and greater gas throughput per reactor volume, allows for a reduc-
tion in reactor size compared to conventional designs. Moreover,
vortex reactors can process larger quantities of materials per unit
volume.

5. Vortex reactors are characterized by effective thermal back-mixing
while limiting species back-mixing. This feature, combined with a

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 105 (2024) 101176

plug-flow-like residence time distribution, facilitates control over
intermediate product concentrations in processes where secondary
reactions are undesirable [135]. Wery et al. [116] conducted simu-
lations on the behavior of two gas-phase species introduced from the
top and bottom of the slot, respectively. Their findings demonstrated
the absence of lateral mixing between these two streams, as evi-
denced in Fig. 15.

Compared to reactors with rotating zones, vortex reactors are less
energy-intensive without compromising the process intensification ob-
tained. However, vortex technology also has disadvantages.

1. Vortex reactors require significantly larger quantities of gas to
initiate and maintain fluidization, offering advantages over FBRs of
equivalent volume. These gas volumes may appear excessive, espe-
cially when gas does not serve as a reactant, necessitating the recy-
cling of outlet gas and increasing CAPEX costs. However, this
limitation can be mitigated in applications where gas is a reactant,
such as in CH4 oxidative coupling or CO2 sequestration. In such
scenarios, vortex reactors can process higher volumes of gas per
reactor volume more efficiently than alternative technologies [24,
125].

2. Solid particles experience high shear due to intensified particle-
particle and particle-wall interactions, leading to the attrition of
solids. This causes loss of solids during operation and requires the
deployment of solids recovery systems downstream of the reactor or
intermittent feeding to replenish lost solids. However, attrition in-
curs additional costs and negatively impacts the process by changing
the space velocities. Therefore, from a catalysis point of view, it is
essential that a catalyst can sustain the high-shear environment in
vortex reactors. At the same time, it must be ensured that metal-
support interactions are strong enough to prevent metal loss and
reduce catalytic activity.

3. Continuous solids operation is also challenging for several reasons.
Solids feeding is assisted by a purge gas, which can be up to 10 % of
the primary gas flow rate but may unintentionally dilute the reaction
mixture. Solid removal can also lead to unwanted reaction mixture
leaks that are difficult to quantify. The location of the solids outlet is
also challenging to predetermine, as the bed thickness is directly
related to solids loading and inversely related to the gas flow rate.
4. Fluidizing Geldart C-type particles is difficult, as most of the particles
fed to the reactor, regardless of the start-up method, end up
entraining with the gas.

3.4. Applications of vortex reactors

Vortex reactors have been implemented for various applications,
either computationally, experimentally, or both as seen in Table 3.
While the predominant use of vortex devices has been in unit operations
such as drying, recent years have seen a shift toward reactive applica-
tions [136,137]. This is partly because vortex reactors are a relatively
new technology and partly due to factors such as the lack of a suitable
catalyst and the recognition of process intensifications from vortex re-
actors. Since this review focuses primarily on applications, only a brief
overview is given here; refer to for details on all the conceptual and
implemented applications.

3.4.1. Reactive applications

Reactive applications combining high gas throughput and short
contact times are attractive for vortex technology. Examples of such
applications include adsorption processes, gas-phase polymerization,

biomass (or coal) gasification, and fast catalytic partial oxidation of
hydrocarbons. Reactive tests of vortex-based applications mainly focus
on fast biomass pyrolysis, oxidative coupling of methane, and CO2
reactive absorption. Despite the variation in operating conditions,
feedstocks, and targeted products, these processes have similar re-
quirements: short yet effective gas-solid contact times and high heat
transfer rates. Biomass fast pyrolysis benefits greatly from the rapid
heating of solid particles and the concurrent removal of generated char,
which otherwise might catalyze undesirable product degradation.
Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) studies on fast pyrolysis biomass
have forecasted bio-oil yields of up to 70 % from biomass feedstock,
facilitating in situ separation of char from unreacted biomass [124].
These predictions have recently been experimentally validated by
Manzano [138], who achieved a 72 % (w/w) bio-oil yield from pine at
500
C using a vortex reactor, with char yields around 10 %. The pro-
duced bio-oil was notably rich in phenolics, syringols, and catechols,
with no aromatics detected. Fig. 16 summarizes the product yields from

these experiments and compares them with data from various reactor
types using the same biomass feed.

◦

Catalytic oxidative coupling of methane also requires short contact
times between methane-oxygen and the catalyst. However, effectively
removing the exothermic reaction heat for high olefin yields is crucial
for OCM. Several CFD and mathematical studies have predicted C2
yields exceeding 25 % from OCM conducted in a GSVR [139]. Recently,
a proof-of-concept experimental study demonstrated OCM at 850
C in a
vortex reactor and predicted a 6 % C2 yield for a N2:O2:CH4 feed of
20:1:4 [140]. The study employed a SiC-based Sr–La catalyst that
enabled it to withstand the highly attrition-prone reactor environment,
paving the way for other high-temperature catalytic applications.
Similar studies investigating the thermal conversion of natural gas to
lower olefins were recently conducted in a vortex-like device known as
ANJEVOC (Novel Annular Jet Vortex Reactor). Pannala et al. compu-
tationally predicted C2 yields as high as 28 %, with excellent scalability
[141]. Vortex reactors are also attractive for OCM as the fluidizing gas is
a reactant, unlike fast pyrolysis biomass. Thus, the high volumetric gas
flows can potentially result in a high throughput compared to other
reactor choices for OCM.

Computationally, an industrial SO2/NOx adsorption process (SNAP)
was also studied by Ashcraft [142] and demonstrated excellent process
intensification compared to the conventionally preferred riser reactors.
The vortex reactors removed 0.93 and 0.33 mol
reactor of SO2 and

reactor in a
NOx, respectively, compared to 0.0086 and 0.0027 mol
riser due to the densely packed solid bed and larger surface area avail-
able. The authors further showed the potential for process enhancement
by incorporating feed recycling.

(cid:0) 1 m3

Carbon capture via CO2 sequestration proceeds through reactive
absorption in an alkali. The effectiveness of CO2 removal in all the ab-
sorption processes is directly proportional to the interfacial surface area
available in the reactor. Ouyang et al. [117] experimentally demon-
strated that a GLVR (gas-liquid vortex reactor) can generate high
(cid:0) 3, which
interfacial areas per reactor volumes of the order of 5000 m2 m
is several orders of magnitude higher than those achieved in conven-
tional bubble or packed column reactors. Additionally, vortex reactors
provide 1 to 2 orders of magnitude higher mass transfer coefficients than
other reactor types when comparing the volumetric mass transfer co-
efficient against the total energy dissipation (Fig. 17). Thus, vortex re-
actors offer absorption intensification without needing a mechanical
stirrer.

3.4.2. Non-reactive applications

The intense centrifugal action inside the vortex forces the absorbed
moisture (used for the liquid content inside solids) out and entrains it in
the outgoing gas, making vortex devices primarily used in various dry-
ing operations. Additionally, spherical solid particles are typically ob-
tained from vortex reactors due to centrifugal forces and wall-solid-fluid

Loftus et al. [144] used a gas-liquid vortex reactor as a scrubber for
fine fly ash particles in the incoming gas stream, mimicking the flue gas
from industrial coal combustors and achieving 99 % efficiency in
removing particles as small as 3 μm (particles an order of magnitude
smaller were removed with ~90 % efficiency). The confined vortex
scrubber showed favorable scale-up compared to conventional inertial
separators, allowing pressure drops through the scrubber to be opti-
mized using inlet gas flow, particle load, liquid amount, and bubble
sizes.

4. Internal circulating FBR (ICFBR)

Circulating fluidized beds are a particular category among fluidized
beds, and they can circulate particles externally (conventional circu-
lating beds or CFB) or internally (ICFBR). In the following sections, the
latter are described, including their advantages and disadvantages,
applicability, modifications to enhance them, and visualization and
simulation studies.

4.1. Concept and functionality

ICFBRs are single vessels where particles move following an estab-
lished path [157] by dividing the reactor into two zones with a plate
(baffle type ICFBR) [157–161]. The circulation of particles between two
distinct zones is facilitated by applying varying fluidizing gas velocities,
typically distinguished as the fast bed and slow bed. This variation in gas
velocity results in different porosities within the beds, thereby creating a
pressure gradient at the reactor bottom. This gradient drives the
movement of particles between zones through openings located at both
the top and bottom of the zones [158,162–164].

This reactor exemplifies process intensification because this geom-
etry allows it to operate in two different atmospheres in the same vessel
while differentiating from the TZFBR because the separation between
zones is physical and delimited. A schematic representation of the ICFBR
is shown in Fig. 18 (left).

It is essential to consider that solid recirculation is the critical

parameter to control when designing an ICFBR. The solid flow through
each one and between sections is mainly affected by superficial gas
velocity, specifically the ratio between both zones, particle size, bed
height, and the size and shape of the connection between zones [159,
160,163,165–167].

4.2. Advantages and shortcomings

ICFBRs have multiple advantages over conventional FBRs. The most
apparent advantage is their capacity to maintain two separate atmo-
spheres where reactants and products do not mix. This increases safety
and selectivity and simplifies the circulation of solids compared to
TZFBR. In the ICFBR, bubbles carry the movement of solids through and
between beds, allowing for the maximum downward flow of solids
without producing gas back-mixing. The separation between zones is
physical, and the movement of solids between zones is driven by pres-
sure perpendicular to gas movement. Proper connections and small
dead-volume valves prevent gas mixing between zones. However,
leakage could be significant in reactor configurations without re-
strictions on the gas flow between both zones through the upper and
lower connecting holes (Fig. 19). One challenging aspect of the ICFBR is
reaching an operating window with a high flow rate of solids and a
minimum gas shortcut.

The mixing of the currents from each zone is evident in configura-
tions without a separation plate in the freeboard (Fig. 18). This is crucial
when maintaining two separate atmospheres throughout the reactor is
required, such as the separation of H2 from gas streams through the
steam-iron process, an example of a reduction-oxidation system [169].
Properly designing the connection between zones and maintaining a
significant difference in gas velocities of both zones can prevent gas
back-mixing and promote greater solid flow [163,165,166,170,171].
While this strategy offers promising advantages, it also introduces safety
concerns. For instance, solids might not flow as intended (e.g., plugged
solid flow or failure in controlling gas feed to each zone), potentially
allowing an oxidizing agent to reach the reaction zone. However, it is
important to recognize that this issue is not unique to the ICFBR but can
occur in any conventional reactor handling gas-phase oxidations. One of
the key characteristics of the ICFBR is its enhanced solid circulation. The
clearly defined path for solids from one zone to another allows for
straightforward control of solid flow by employing varying gas velocities
in the two zones (Fig. 20). This approach helps prevent issues like par-
ticle segregation by size or gas back-mixing, enabling the reactor to
operate at higher gas velocities than other configurations [159,161,162,
165,172,173]. However, solid circulation does not only depend on gas

movement of solid flow presents two advantages over the original path.
First, the flow of solids could be enhanced because the movement of the
solids is not confined to a single direction, eliminating solid clogging at
the connection point between zones. Second, heat and energy transfer
are improved due to an increased contact area (per unit of volume)
between zones [188].

Another modification involves the gas distributor (Fig. 21), which
can be elevated in one of the beds [167,172,183], inclined at a certain
angle to facilitate solid movement from one zone to another [159,166,
187], or even altered from a flat plate to different geometries [159,167].

4.4.2. Coupling ICFBR with other technologies

The original design of the ICFBR employs either smooth or bubbling
fluidization regimes for both zones, where the flow of solids can be
modulated by the difference in gas velocity between them. A notable
modification to this design incorporates alternative fluidization regimes
for one or both zones, specifically fast fluidization, such as riser or
downer regimes [175,180,183,185]. Integrating draft-tube geometries
within the ICFBR, combined with riser and downer regimes, could
enhance control over solid flow and improve contact between the solid
and gas phases.

Owing to its superior management of solid flow between zones,
ICFBRs can be integrated with other technologies where controlling
solid flow is challenging. One such technology is the TZFBR, where
managing solid flow, driven by ascending bubbles, is a critical opera-
tional parameter. The synergy of these two technologies, illustrated in
Fig. 18 (right), allows for precise control of catalyst flow through the
reactor by adjusting the gas velocity ratio between the zones [162,171,
181–183]. This integration not only enhances the overall process but
also serves as a prime example of process intensification, with each
technology addressing a limitation of the other.

Furthermore, the adaptation of membrane technology represents a
promising enhancement to the ICFBR system. Although research in this
domain is relatively limited, some studies have demonstrated its
viability for methane steam reforming (Fig. 22). In these studies, the
membrane facilitated a higher yield of targeted products (in this context,
H2) by shifting the reaction equilibrium. Concurrently, the optimized
solid flow and heat transfer characteristics of the ICFBR mitigated heat
transfer limitations associated with reforming [178,179,189].

velocity but is also affected by particle properties, the size of the orifice
between zones, and reactor geometry and design [159,161,163,165,
170,174], making it challenging to achieve optimal operation if the solid
does not flow as designed.

The system also enhances energy transfer between zones. As a result
of the high flow of solids between both zones, the reactor can be
considered isothermal. This characteristic is particularly advantageous
for processes involving one exothermic and one endothermic reaction.
In such cases, one zone generates heat, which is then transported by the
solid to the other zone, where it can be utilized [162,164,172,175].
However, despite a thorough understanding of reaction rates for each
zone, energy transfer is significantly influenced by catalyst properties,
such as thermal conductivity and size. This can lead to high-temperature
gradients between beds, even with high solid circulation rates [175].

4.3. Applications of ICFBRs

4.5. ICFBR experimental and mathematical models

ICFBRs have attracted attention for several reactions due to their
advantages over conventional fluidized reactors as seen in Table 4. The
geometries range from basic ICFBR configurations, such as baffler-type
designs, to more advanced ones, described in the subsequent section.
Potential applications for the ICFBR include coal or biomass gasification
[164,174–176], ethanol or hydrocarbon reforming [177–179], oxida-
tive coupling of methane [180], hydrocarbon dehydrogenation [162,
181,182], partial oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride [182], dry
reforming of methane [183], among others [169].

4.4. Process intensification

The original design of the ICFBR has been modified to enhance its
capability and performance. These changes encompass two main di-
rections: modifying the original system design and coupling the system
with other technologies.

4.4.1. Design modifications

The most common design modification involves changing the ge-
ometry of the physically separated zones from a plate-type to a tube-type
design, as shown in Fig. 18 (center) [159,172,183,185,187]. This vari-
ation changes the flow of solids from a 2D movement to a 3D axial di-
rection, in which the solids move upwards through the internal face of
the tube and downwards through the external front of it. Changing the

Although the ICFBR promotes solid circulation within a single vessel,
predicting the solid recirculation rate quantitatively is challenging due
to multiple factors such as geometry, operating conditions, and gas/solid
properties [165].

Experimental systems have been used to investigate reactor hydro-
dynamics [157,160,165,166,190,191], while physical and numerical
models help optimize the design and operating conditions and allow for
trial changes in operating conditions and geometrical configurations
[163,170,185]. Measuring solid flows or circulation rates underlies
many experimental studies with cold-flow transparent ICFBRs con-
cerning dynamic behaviors, including direct calculation, non-intrusive,
optical probes, and combined methods.

4.5.1. Direct calculation methods

These methods determine the solid circulation rate by measuring the
weight of the collected solids in a specific system location within the
consumed time. In an early work, an ICFBR was developed and used to
study the effects of several parameters [157]. These parameters were the
superficial gas velocities introduced through various injection ports, the
static pressure, and the coarse foreign solids’ movement under various
operating conditions. The results showed the same advantages as con-
ventional dual-circulation systems with the feasibility of pressurized
operation, which is almost impossible to achieve using traditional
methods.

4.5.2. Non-intrusive method

4.5.3.

Intrusive methods

Non-intrusive methods involve obtaining results from visualizing
tracer-like particles. In these methods, colored or marked particles are
introduced into a transparent reactor (with two or three-dimensional
geometries) to obtain time-dependent movement vector fields, which
can be translated into models and correlations through software.

Some authors described a non-intrusive radiotracer-based method
for determining the solids circulation rate in a cold-flow four-cell ICFBR.
This method directly measures the residence time of a single radioactive
glass bead (radiotracer particle) in two adjacent cells [190]. It can be
achieved by labeling solid particles with radioactive 24Na or 192Ir and
monitoring them with two external NaI scintillation detectors. The solid
circulation rate between the interconnected cells is determined by
calculating the radiotracer particle’s mean residence time and the solid
mass. For this method to be effective, the characteristics of the radio-
tracer particle and the solids in the cell should be as similar as possible,
including particle size, shape, density, and possibly electrostatic prop-
erties. This technique accurately measures the RTD of the particles, in-
dependent of other processes occurring within the system, such as the
generation of static electricity during fluidization.

Other researchers have utilized a twin fluidized bed solid circulation
system where two adjacent beds exchange solids [160]. In this system, a
high-speed digital video camera records the particle flow in the lower
orifice through the transparent reactor wall. Using a computer correla-
tion analysis method, the recorded video can determine particle flow
velocity, and the total solid flow rate can be obtained based on the
measured particle velocities at different times. Experiments on a
small-scale setup have shown that bed material properties, gas velocities
of the two beds, orifice size, and distance are the main factors affecting
the solid circulation rate.

Another approach to studying solid flow characteristics and circu-
lation rate in an ICFBR is to use a single fluorescent sphere as a tracer
and record its trajectories with a camera [165]. In this setup, the flu-
idized bed is placed in a dark room to observe the fluorescent movement
more clearly. A tool like MATLAB can be used to process the images to
determine the particle positions, velocity and solid circulation rate. This
method can yield results that align with experimental measurements in
literature and predictions using the correlation based on Bernoulli’s
equation.

Intrusive methods, which affect the measurement of solid or gas flow
development through the reactor, include gas sampling tubes and op-
tical probes but have advantages such as gas concentration or direct
velocity measurements.

One method to determine the solids circulation rate involves
measuring the particle’s downward velocity in the moving bed by
employing two thermistor probes to trace heated bed material [168].
When hot sand particles interact with the probe, a change in resistance is
converted into voltage through a bridge circuit. The particle’s down-
ward velocity can be estimated by measuring the time lag between the
peak-to-peak distances of two distinct signals. It is assumed that the
particle velocity measured at the center of the annulus represents the
average bulk velocity within the annulus. Similarly, thermistor probes
can also be utilized to investigate solid circulation in a cold-mode
transparent ICFBR equipped with an orifice-type square draft tube
[191].

A similar procedure can be used to obtain the solid circulation rate
across a two-compartment fluidized bed. This system, divided by a pair
of V-valves and a riser, exhibits solid flow characteristics that depend on
various design and operating parameters [192]. In this case, calculations
were performed based on the heat balance of circulating solids under
steady-state conditions by measuring the average temperature of the
upstream bed and the inlet and outlet gas temperatures. This method is
akin to the one previously described but relies on the overall heat bal-
ance rather than the heat transfer of individual particles.

Other research in this field involves a cold-flow ICFBR utilized to
explore gas-solid flow characteristics in a novel
furnace design,
employing reflective-type optical probes and differential pressure
transmitters for measurements [193]. This study focused on examining
the particle internal circulation rate and solid holdup in the furnace’s
upper space by varying the height of the partition wall, initial static bed
height, and fluidization air velocity in the main zone. The findings
indicated that the particle internal circulation rate decreases with an
increase in the partition wall height but increases with the initial static
bed height in the main zone and reaches a maximum with a certain
fluidization air velocity. However, although the solids holdup in the
upper space of the ICFBR cold system constituted only 1–4% of that in a
conventional CFBR, the proportion of particle external circulation rate
was relatively low in the circulating system.

Tracer-tracked particle trajectories generate a set of solid dynamic
properties. Solid falling in the annulus zone is collected and measured by
the sampling probe. Solid RTD measurements are taken in the volume
space delimited by the external column of the ICFBR. With the solid
concentration and solid RTD at the exit zone, the effects of the riser exit
geometry on pressure drop and solid behavior inside the ICFBR are
studied. Solid RTD results and axial solid hold-up profiles provide clear
evidence that the separator device at the riser exit significantly affects
the hydrodynamics of the ICFBR riser. The V-shaped riser exit geometry
is optimal among the configurations studied (Λ, V, double cone, and
none).

4.6. Reactor simulations

Physical and numerical models are often used to test modifications in
operating conditions and geometrical configurations due to the limita-
tions of visual methods at larger scales. These models have proven
helpful for adequately designing and operating ICFBR systems based on
a better understanding of the phenomena involved.

Particle circulation between two fluidized beds can be investigated
using an open-loop circulating apparatus with two compartments
separated by a partition plate [195]. A model for calculating driving and

CPFD [161] have been adopted to better describe the particle in-
teractions. As DEM models each individual particle as a separate entity,
it is computationally resource–consuming. The CPFD method based on
the Eulerian–Lagrangian scheme has become one of the most practicable
approaches for studying gas–solid interactions in fluidized bed reactors
with the convenience of less computational resources and scale–up
feasibility.

4.6.1. Pure hydrodynamic models

Pure hydrodynamic models aim to predict and explain phenomena in
ICFBRs by considering the properties and movement of both solids and
gas through the different zones of the reactor. No reaction is assumed in
these models, so the solid and gas flux/flows do not change.

One study investigated gas and solid dynamics in an ICFBR using the
Eulerian-Eulerian model alongside the kinetic theory of granular flow
(KTGF) in Fluent® [163]. Simulations were performed to assess the ef-
fect of changes to four different parameters: gas distributor plate angles,
the presence of a heat exchange tube bundle, superficial gas velocities,
and initial packed solid heights based on a two-dimensional geometry.
The mechanism governing the solid recirculation in an ICFBR is
explained, and the effect of those parameters can be quantified in terms
of the solid recirculation rate. From the parametric study, superficial gas
velocities and initial packed solid height significantly affect the solid
circulation rate. Moreover, the presence of a tube bundle reduced the
inclination angle had
solid recirculation rate by 20 %, while a 1.5
minimal effect on the recirculation rate.

◦

Other studies also utilize Fluent® to model the behavior of bed
particles [167,170]. The first employed a two-fluid model
in a
two-dimensional baffle-type ICFBR to assess the effects of gas distributor
types, superficial gas velocity, and zone height elevation on solid cir-
culation. The second study used a multi-fluid Eulerian model to simulate
the solid circulation rate, focusing on a binary mixture of solids (two
particle types with different sizes and densities) in a twin-zone ICFBR.
The effects of varying gas velocities, mix of solids, and mixture
composition were investigated. Results indicated that
the ICFBR
exhibited a higher capacity for solid mixing than a conventional
bubbling fluidized bed, which aligns with the previously mentioned
advantageous feature of this type of reactor.

Another model can be generated by numerically investigating the
gas-solid flow dynamics in a three-dimensional baffle-type ICFBR using
CFD-discrete element methods (CFD-DEM) [160]. In this approach, gas
flow is modeled using large eddy simulation (LES), while solid kine-
matics are addressed through the soft-sphere model. Gas-solid dynamics
and parameter sensitivity analysis elucidate the mechanisms driving
specific circulation behaviors. The pressure difference between the two
zones acts as the driving force for solid circulation through the gap,
while bubble evolution, breakup, and gas flow diversion stimulate solid
circulation over the baffle.

When employing CPFD Barracuda software to simulate a three-zone
ICFBR at room temperature, a comparison between visual experiments
and modeling (Fig. 23) indicated that the multiphase particle-in-cell
(MP-PIC) method could qualitatively predict
ICFBR
behavior [161]. This encompassed the relative degree of fluidization
between the central reaction zone and the two heat exchange zones, the
bubbling dynamics, and both the relative and absolute bubble sizes
within each zone. Thus, the MP-PIC technique was affirmed as a valid
tool for simulating isothermal bubbling fluidized bed systems containing
Geldart B solids. However, quantitative accuracy diminishes when gas
velocities approach umf, primarily due to less defined and more homo-
geneous bubbles.

the overall

Other authors had also employed the two-fluid model to examine the
effects of operating gas velocity, particle diameter, and reactor config-
uration on fluidization behavior in an ICFBR [172]. This study specif-
ically focused on the solid circulation rate, gas bypass fraction, and solid
circulation pattern, all integral to ICFBR performance. Furthermore, the
transition in the solid circulation pattern was found to be closely linked

diction of ICFBR bubbles (b, d) at two different times. Colors for tracking

resisting forces can be developed by measuring pressure gradients and
bed porosities. Experimental results indicated that the most efficient
method to control the circulation rate of solids was by varying the
vertical resisting force in the down-flowing compartment. This was
achieved by adjusting the gas velocity and, thus, the fluidization regime
in this area. Furthermore, a mathematical model [196] described the
flow of solid and gas through an orifice between two aerated beds,
where one operated in a reduced fluidization mode (ug/umf close to 1)
while the other is fully fluidized. The model was qualitatively and, to a
certain extent, quantitatively validated. It demonstrated good agree-
ment with the data and the trends documented in the literature [195].
Another mathematical model [144] calculated the particle flow rate
through the orifice in a TZFBR solid circulation system, considering the
effects of bed material, pressure gradient, and gas velocity. This model
achieved a relative deviation between calculation and experimental data
of less than 15 %. Additionally, other researchers have found that the
bypassing gas fraction can be correlated with gas velocities of the flu-
idized and moving beds, opening area ratio, particle diameter, and solid
height in the bed [191].

All these models and correlations could be integrated with CFD
modeling, which captures the complexities of hydrodynamics, physical
properties, operating conditions, and chemical reactions. Therefore,
various variations in physical design and operational parameters can be
tested and refined until an optimum performance design is identified
[200]. Table 5 summarizes the different simulation methodologies and
features in the ICFBRs by 2D and 3D geometries at the laboratory and
industrial scales. Fluent has been an efficient way to simulate the hy-
drodynamics in the ICFBRs by the two fluid Eulerian-Eulerian model
with different settings of granular flow and drag models ([163,167,170,
185]), for which the reaction kinetics can also be included [183]. The
two–fluid model has limited prediction accuracy due to the assumption
of pseudo–fluid rheological properties of particles, so DEM [160] and

to the gas bypassing behavior. The energy minimization multi-scale drag
model was utilized in Fluent® to simulate industrial-scale ICFBRs
equipped with central downcomers [185]. Based on the two-fluid
model, this research aimed to analyze the impacts of various outlet
structures to develop a model capable of predicting outcomes closely
aligned with experimental observations. The findings indicated that the
solid mass flux circulation is significantly influenced by the reactor
design.

4.6.2. Models involving reaction

Models involving reaction must consider that gas concentration and
flow may change during the reaction. Therefore, the evolution of these
factors through the reactor must be included in the model, as they may
also impact the flow of solids. In the two-dimensional Eulerian-Eulerian
model used in Fluent®, the mass, momentum, and energy governing
equations are solved together with KTGF to describe gas-solid hydro-
dynamic characteristics, like in this example of an ICFBR [183]. This
work considered the dry reforming of CH4 and coke oxidation, which
were included in a CFD model using user-defined functions (UDFs). The
analysis of variance revealed [196] that the length of the loop seal and
the gas outlet diameter have significant negative and positive effects on
methane conversion, respectively. The interaction between the size of
the loop seal and the gas outlet diameter also significantly impacts
methane conversion.

5. Considerations and perspectives

Notably, multifunctional FBRs will attract greater attention in
multiphase process intensification in the coming decades [197]. This
section discusses some common considerations and potential enhance-
ments to make their implementation more seamless.

5.1. Common considerations

As stated in previous sections, FBRs are an exciting alternative to
traditional packed beds. Although their use is less widespread, they offer
undeniable advantages in laboratory and industrial scales. However,
certain considerations should be considered when using FBRs, especially
multifunctional designs like the ones described herein.

5.1.1. Geldart’s classification and fluidization regimes

When using solid particles in FBRs, one of the first considerations is
their physical properties, such as particle size and density, which
significantly affect how the solid behaves in the fluidized bed and how
easily the desired fluidized regime for specific applications can be ach-
ieved. To characterize the solid type, it is common to refer to Geldart’s
classification, which typically requires knowledge of the gas, particle
density, and particle size. Powders can be classified into four groups
(aeratable, bubbling, cohesive, and spoutable) [33,198].

The type of powder significantly influences how it fluidizes with
increasing gas velocity. Aeratable and bubbling solids generally transi-
tion from smooth to bubbling to turbulent fluidization, cohesive solids
exhibit channeling before entering turbulent fluidization, and spoutable
solids initially demonstrate spouted fluidization before transitioning to a
turbulent regime. After reaching turbulent fluidization, all powder types
progress to fast fluidization and ultimately to pneumatic transport
[199]. It is important to consider this because some reactors discussed in
this review require specific fluidization regimes for optimal operation.
The two-zone and the internal circulating reactors are designed to
facilitate the vertical movement of solids by gas bubbles, rendering them
suitable only for the bubbling regime. In lower gas velocity regimes,
such as smooth fluidization, no gas bubbles are present to transport the
solid [14,200], while at higher gas velocities, in a turbulent regime, gas
back-mixing becomes pronounced [201–203].

Interestingly, the direct application of the Geldart classification to
vortex reactors has sparked extensive debate due to the dissimilarity in

the driving forces at play: 1 G in traditional fluidized beds versus several
orders of G in a vortex reactor. This difference is the main reason for the
hesitancy to directly apply the Geldart classification; the experimental
literature indicates a transition from Geldart B-type to D-type particles
as the centrifugal force increases in a rotating fluidized bed, where both
the vessel and solid bed rotate [204,205]. Despite these findings, the
Geldart classification is often used for vortex devices due to its simplicity
and the lack of alternative classifications. However, a detailed experi-
mental campaign is necessary to fully map the fluidization regimes
under the influence of high-gravitational environments.

Unpublished experimental data from the Laboratory for Chemical
Technology at Ghent University have revealed potential fluidization
behaviors for C-type particles in vortex reactors. Preliminary fluidiza-
tion trials with a batch feed of flour-like material and developed gas flow
indicated a transient bed formation prone to entrainment. However, at
steady state, a thin layer of solids was observed to rotate near the inner
walls of the reactor, constituting less than 20 % of the feed mass. Similar
observations were also recently made for an OCM catalyst, highlighting
the challenges of sustaining a bed of Geldart C-type particles under
ambient and reactive conditions [140]. Therefore, understanding the
transition between fluidized regimes is crucial in reaction engineering
and reactor design, as it elucidates the phenomena occurring inside the
reactor, especially the interaction between gas and solid phases.

5.1.2. Solid attrition, wear, and fines entrainment

Particle attrition occurs when particles break into smaller ones due to
abrasion or stress caused by impacts, reactions, or thermal changes.
Wear (also known as erosion) refers to the loss of material from the
particle’s surface through continuous contact with gas or other solids.
Both effects are relevant in fluidized systems, but wear is particularly
important in systems with high local gas and entrained particle veloc-
ities, such as the vortex reactor [206,207]. Corrosion and scaling can
exacerbate these phenomena, which are relevant for processes with high
chlorine or sulfur content, a lack of oxidation control, high tempera-
tures, and a reducing atmosphere. While the formation of fines is usually
problematic, in some fluidization regimes, it can be advantageous. In
smooth and bubbling regimes, adding or generating fines can improve
fluidization by reducing the interaction between particles and walls,
reducing umf [208,209].

However, the formation of fines is detrimental to bed stability in
vortex reactors, leading to material loss through entrainment. Dynamic
image processing and sieve analysis of attrited-entrained particles from
a vortex reactor have shown increased particle roundness and decreased
Feret diameter (the longest diagonal measurement). Surface abrasion
was reported as the primary attrition mechanism for the Sr–La–O/SiC
particles in the GSVR. However, the breakup of larger particles also
seems to contribute, albeit insignificantly, to attrition-led entrainment
[140]. To achieve a complete understanding and better predict attrition
mechanisms in vortex reactors, more detailed experimental studies
combined with physical characterization techniques are required.

5.1.3. Solid flow control

Solid flow control is another important phenomenon. However,
there are two types of solid flows to consider. The first type occurs inside
the reactor (typically called GS) and is described as the internal circu-
lation of solids between different zones. The control of this solid flow is
significant in reactors, where it forms a closed loop, meaning no solid is
added or removed from the reactor vessel. The flow of solids in the
TZFBR and ICFBR is critical because it determines the residence time in
each reaction section, directly affecting reactor performance. In these
systems, the flow of solids is influenced by the cloud-bubble-wake
interaction, and its behavior depends on strict control of the size, ve-
locity, and distribution of bubbles throughout the bed.

The second type involves continuous solid flow, with solids being fed
into and removed from the reactor during continuous operation. This is
crucial in certain fluidization regimes, such as spouted and pneumatic

transport fluidization, and influences parameters like residence and
contact time between gas and solid. Continuous solids operation in
vortex reactors is challenging for various reasons. Solids feeding must be
assisted by purge gas, which can constitute up to 10 % of the primary gas
flow rate, potentially leading to unintentional dilution of the reaction
mixture. Conversely, solids removal can also result in unintended
quantification challenges for the reaction mixture. Determining the
precise location for the solids outlet is difficult, as the bed thickness is
directly related to solids loading and inversely proportional to the gas
flow rate. Therefore, while continuous solids operation for vortex de-
vices is appealing, it remains unachievable without significant design
considerations or modifications to reactor geometry.

5.1.4. Gas back-mixing

Gas back-mixing presents a common issue in gas-solid reactors,
occurring when the movement of solids drags gas along with it and is
often attributed to operating at incorrect conditions or in a sub-optimal
fluidization regime. The main consequence of gas back-mixing is the
unwanted mixing of gas streams, resulting in the formation of secondary
products. This is particularly problematic in the TZFBR and ICFBR,
which usually maintain different atmospheres in each section. Uncon-
trolled mixing of gas streams due to back-mixing can negatively impact
both the process’s performance and safety.

A prime example is the continuous reaction-regeneration operation
in the TZFBR for the MTO process [16,54]. If hydrocarbons produced in
the upper section mix with oxygen fed to the lower section, it could
create an explosive environment, leading to the loss of valuable products
and damage to the reactor. Based on their operating principles, vortex
reactors operate with limited or no species back-mixing and are,
therefore, ideal for thermally sensitive chemistries involving several
series-parallel reactions.

5.1.5. Electrostatics

Electrostatic forces become significant during operations involving
small particles (less than 100 μm) in fluidized systems. These forces are
generated when two particles come into contact and are separated or
when a charged particle interacts with a conductor surface, such as the
metallic reactor wall. They can lead to considerable operational chal-
lenges, such as particle agglomeration or adhesion to the reactor wall,
causing deviations from desired operation, defluidization, and necessi-
tating shutdowns for cleaning [206,210,211]. The formation and in-
tensity of electrostatic forces typically depend on various characteristics
of the fluidization system, including temperature, pressure, particle
material and size, reactor wall material, and the velocity and humidity
of the gas [212–214].

5.1.6. Gas distribution systems

The behavior of a reactor is significantly influenced by the gas feed
method to the fluidized bed. The gas distribution system determines the
fluidization regime—such as bubbling, riser, downer, or spouted—and
directly impacts the efficiency of gas-solid contact, thereby affecting
performance. In bubbling reactors, such as the TZFBR and the ICFBR, gas
is typically introduced upwards through a porous plate, facilitating
uniform bubble formation and distribution [159,167,185,215]. How-
ever, in the TZFBR, the upper gas feed mechanism involves not a porous
plate but a rod whose shape and dimensions significantly influence gas
distribution [47,74,87]. In contrast, gas distribution in vortex reactors
adopts a unique approach, utilizing a multi-point feed design through
azimuthal slots, which obviates the need for traditional gas distributors.

regime, where the solid bed remains inside the reactor body, or in the
pneumatic transport regime, where solid removal occurs continuously.
Since both the TZFBR and the ICFBR operate in the bubbling regime,
they are considered bubbling columns, and their design is based on a
cylindrical reactor body. Although one is essentially similar to the other,
both reactors have their particularities. On the one hand, the TZFBR is
vertically divided into sections with different diameters but not sepa-
rated by a physical barrier. Each section has an additional gas feed,
arranged vertically: one at the bottom of the vessel and the other at the
top. On the other hand, the ICFBR is usually divided radially, and its
sections, which can be of different sizes, are separated by a physical
system (plate or tube). In this reactor, the gas feed to each section is at
the bottom of the vessel. Owing to their design, the transition zone be-
tween sections is one of the most critical features in these reactors. In the
TZFBR, this zone has a cylindrical or conical geometry and affects the
gas and solid dynamics between zones, especially if there is a change in
reactor diameter [51,86,87] The ICFBR has a gap shape and mainly
affects the flow of solids between sections [158,186].

The use of internals is a common practice in reactor technology,
mainly used to improve gas and, sometimes, solid flow control. In
bubbling reactors such as the TZFBR and ICFBR, the shape, size, and
location of the internals aim to break the bubbles and improve gas-solid
contact. However, they also hinder the movement of solids, an effect
that must be considered carefully in reactors where it can produce
defluidization and dead zones [6,51,161,185,215,216]. For larger-scale
systems, these internals are usually heat exchangers in the shape of tube
banks [215,217], and their effect on bubbles, solid flow, and heat pro-
files must also be considered.

Reactor size selection is relevant and can be divided into two cate-
gories. The first concerns reactor diameter, where two approaches can
be taken. First, the ratio between the reactor diameter and particle size
(DR/Dp) is usually associated with small-scale systems, where particle-
particle and particle-wall interactions significantly affect gas and solid
flow patterns in the bed [218,219]. These phenomena are especially
relevant in bubbling beds because such interactions can produce
agglomeration, defluidization, and channeling, worsening gas-solid
contact and producing severe heat and mass gradients along the bed.
The second category considers the influence of reactor size on hydro-
dynamics. For bed diameters commonly used at the laboratory scale, 20
cm or smaller, there is a zone of preferred bubble flow near the bed walls
at lower bed heights.

In contrast, bubbles grow and move toward the center, ascribable to
coalescence, higher up in the bed [220,221]. For the reactors considered
in this review, bubble development is a crucial concern for both TZFBR
and ICFBR because it influences the solid flow between zones. The
objective is to maintain a good bubble size and distribution throughout
the bed. In vortex reactors, the particle diameter should always be
smaller than the slot opening to prevent losing momentum due to par-
ticle rotation around its axis. It is postulated that the slots could be
replaced by multiple, narrow holes through which the fluidizing gas can
enter the reactor zone (provided the area of all holes is the same as the
total area of all the circles), achieving more uniform fluidization. CFD
simulations have reported a lack of significant axial-radial mixing be-
tween the gas from the bottom and the top of the slots [135,222]. This
feature could be utilized to study processes such as chemical looping or
fluid catalytic cracking. The second category concerns the solid bed
height, which is closely related to gas flow development. This parameter
affects residence and contact time and is particularly important in the
TZFBR, where the height of each zone affects conversion, product yields,
and safety because both zones share the same solid bed.

Reactor design is a crucial aspect of reaction engineering and re-

quires careful consideration to create an optimal FBR.

The fluidization regime at which the reactor operates is one of the
key factors in the design process. The reactor design will differ
depending on whether it operates in the smooth, bubbling, or turbulent

Although the multifunctional reactors presented in this study offer
several enhancements over traditional fluidized beds, there is still room
for improvement. Process, design, or catalyst-based modifications could

26

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 105 (2024) 101176

enhance the performance of multifunctional FBRs. This section explores
these enhancements for each type of reactor.

5.2.1. Process-based enhancements

Solid segregation is common in fluidized systems, where attrition,
fines production, electrostatics, and solid flow control are crucial pa-
rameters. Segregation can occur in systems with solids of the same size
but different densities or solids of different sizes and the same density. In
the first case, the bed segregates rapidly, and the dense material forms a
relatively pure bottom layer, while the upper layer always contains some
uniformly dispersed denser solids. In the second case, particles of
different sizes but the same density segregate more slowly. Particles with
a bimodal and narrow size distribution will mix uniformly under mod-
erate bubbling conditions, while less segregation is expected with a
broader size distribution [216]. Rising bubbles are considered the pri-
mary mechanism for particle segregation since they carry up solids in
their wake. However, only larger, denser particles move down the bed
through the temporarily disturbed region (wake) as a bubble passes
[223]. Gas velocity is the main process parameter to consider for
avoiding or reducing the effects of segregation. Segregation can be se-
vere at gas velocities close to the umf, but increasing the velocity can
significantly reduce this phenomenon [216,223–225]. Particle segre-
gation is a significant concern in systems like the TZFBR and ICFBR
because it disrupts the solid flow through different sections of these
reactors. However, segregation can be advantageous in processes with in
situ regeneration. In these cases, segregation is caused by increased coke
content in solid particles, which makes the particles denser and favors
their downward movement to the regeneration section. This is favorable
only in the TZFBR because the solid flow between sections is axial,
unlike in the ICFBR, which is radial. Focusing on processes similar to
biomass fast pyrolysis, where one of the reaction products is a fine solid
that can be entrained by reactor hydrodynamics, could be more appli-
cable in vortex reactors. Such applications eliminate the need for addi-
tional solids outlets and can function conveniently in continuous mode.
Conversely, solids of different densities and diameters can form radially
separated, rotating beds under dissimilar centrifugal-drag forces [24],
paving the way for using vortex reactors as solid separators.

Selecting the optimal fluidization regime is important in both TZFBR
and ICFBR operations, as they both target bubbling fluidization, where
bubbles transport the solid between zones. Bubbles’ size and velocity are
mainly determined by the gas velocity, which controls the operation by
needing to be above the minimum bubbling velocity but below the
critical velocity, where the turbulent fluidization regime starts, and gas
back-mixing becomes relevant [33,34,215,226].

Numerous methods reduce erosion, such as using internals to mini-
mize direct contact with particles or lower gas velocities, which apply
directly to the bubbling reactors in this study. However, to operate
under the best conditions, other effects like bubble formation or solid
flow disruption must be considered along with erosion. In vortex re-
actors, lowering gas velocity is sometimes not ideal because it affects
momentum.

Typical strategies to cope with corrosion include using low-oxygen
combustion, ensuring a uniform distribution of combustion air and
fuel, avoiding local hot spots, injecting additives, controlling the flue
temperature at the furnace outlet, and utilizing corrosion-resistant
alloys.

An additional perspective unique to vortex reactors is that liquid
feeding is much simpler than solid feeding due to its free flowability and
ability to feed against adverse pressure gradients. A highly bubbling
liquid bed has been experimentally demonstrated for easily dispersed,
like H2O [122]. However, using
low-surface
high-viscosity liquids, such as oil or honey, may result in annular,
core-annular (or radially stratified) gas-liquid flow patterns. The phys-
ical properties of a given liquid can be modified to better suit the
gas-liquid flow regime required for a specific application by controlling
temperature, pressure, and additives. Additionally, by leveraging the

tension liquids

incompressible nature of liquids, the operating pressure offers another
degree of freedom in pursuing process intensification. Introducing liq-
uids as a secondary phase in vortex reactors opens new horizons, pre-
senting possibilities that are not as readily apparent in gas-solid
applications. Liquid feeding via a pump can also eliminate the need for
purge gas, which is necessary for solids feeding.

Heat transfer enhancement is also relevant in fluidized systems,
which can be improved by introducing heat exchangers in the reactor,
typically in the form of tube bundles. However, adding these systems as
internals can disrupt the flow of gas and solids, potentially leading to
defluidization and dead zones in the solid bed [51,217,227,228]. This
concern is particularly significant in the TZFBR and the ICFBR, where
solid flow and its contact with bubbles are critical, especially for pro-
cesses with in situ regeneration. Computational studies mostly support
these claims made for vortex reactors, but an experimental heat transfer
model/correlation is needed to validate them numerically. Such a model
can help predict the exact particle temperature for a given application
with sufficient accuracy. However, developing such a model is more
practical, as it requires simultaneously recording the particle tempera-
ture of a high-velocity bed, and both measurements rely on high-speed
cameras.

Despite efforts to quantify process intensification, head-to-head
comparisons against traditional reactors are still necessary for applica-
tions. Doing so will provide a holistic view of using multifunctional re-
actors for a given application across the scales.

5.2.2. Design-based enhancements

Reactor design in reactor engineering is crucial

for carefully
designing multifunctional reactors to operate under optimal conditions.
However, almost every design parameter affects others, resulting in
tradeoffs. For instance, in the case of the TZFBR reactor, changing the
reactor section influences gas velocity in both zones. Similarly, altering
the gas feed to one section affects gas velocity, fluidization, and solid
exchange between the top and bottom zones. Moreover, modifying the
upper gas distribution system impacts fluidization, bubble formation
and development, the upwards-downwards flow of solid, and the con-
tact between gas and solid [48,68,70,182]. The Men ́endez-Herguido
group at the University of Zaragoza [48,61] has primarily conducted
TZFBR design studies, focusing on fluid dynamic studies [65,86,87],
changes in gas feeding systems [56,64], and modeling [51,70,75,87].

Despite having similar features, the ICFBR has a physical separation
between zones, making its design and operation easier. In this system,
changing some design parameters do not affect others; for example,
changing gas velocity in one zone has little effect on the other. However,
designing the ICFBR depends mainly on the hole or gap that separates
both zones because its optimal operation is defined by the correct ex-
change of solids between them. Several features have been proposed to
improve its design, including modifying the gas distributor [163,167,
188], introducing internals [161,163], or changing the geometry of the
gap or reactor [163,174,183,186].

Gonzalez-Quiroga et al. [125] have demonstrated the effective use of
CFD simulations to optimize the design of a GSVR for biomass-fast py-
rolysis. Based on the CFD simulations, the following modifications were
made to the bare reactor geometry: the use of a single gas inlet to the
jacket (without any observable non-uniformity in the flows, pressure, or
velocities in the jacket-slots-reactor zone [124]); rounding off the slot
edges (minimizing streamline curvature and reducing pressure drop);
profiling the bottom end wall of the reactor (reducing backflow region);
and implementing a converging-diverging exhaust, among others.
Similar design optimization iterations can be applied to other applica-
tions through targeted numerical studies. Recent experimental and
computational studies have shown the possibility of further improving
the utilization of incoming gas momentum using stator-rotor-type de-
signs [125]. Design improvements include equipping the reaction zone
with multiple paddles, where the incoming gas rotates, significantly
increasing the solid velocity compared to conventional designs.

Although these designs offer enhancements, their implementation for
reactive applications is pending the development of suitable designs that
allow effective solids handling at high temperatures.

Preference should be given to the vertical central axis design rather
than the horizontal one. Reactors with a vertical axis are prone to axial
non-uniformities but are limited only to the bed length. Horizontal axis
designs, on the other hand, are more susceptible to the effect of gravity
on the bed shape, as reported by various studies [120,229,230]. It is
further postulated that the downwards-oriented reactor exhaust assists
in the solids of the vertical-axis design. It should be noted that this
configuration might result in a lower solid capacity than the vertically
upward outlet design because solids in the freeboard region are due to
the gravitational force overcoming centrifugal force.

5.2.3. Catalyst-based enhancements

One important aspect to consider in fluidized beds is the solid
properties, especially their resistance to attrition. The constant move-
ment of solids in fluidized beds can cause high attrition in solid particles
depending on the fluidization regime. This effect is particularly signifi-
cant in vortex reactors, where the gas velocity is so high that the for-
mation and elutriation of fines could cause operational problems. To
minimize this, some strategies can be applied in catalyst design,
including agglomeration [59,60,231], spray drying [232–237], and
even spouted bed [238–241] preparation techniques.

Enhancing the solid flow through the reactor can be achieved by
favoring the fluidization of the solids. There are two main ways to
achieve this. First, fluidization is preferred if the catalyst is designed
with a spherical shape (or close to φ = 1) because of the lower drag
coefficient and smoother particle-particle interaction [242–244]. Sec-
ond, if the solid size distribution is wide, or some fines are added to the
bed, fluidization can be improved due to the reduction in rubbing be-
tween particles and, thus, bed viscosity [208,209,245].

Another aspect to consider when testing fluidization with small
particles is the electrostatic behavior of the solid, which can affect
fluidization and produce problems such as cluster formation or chan-
neling. To avoid these issues, the catalyst can be designed as large
particles with high electrical conductivity or operated with mild hu-
midity to facilitate discharge through hydrogen bridges of H2O between
particles. However, this latter method could only be applied in some
processes [211,213,214].

Exploring a durable and efficient operation of vortex reactors still
requires addressing shortcomings in developing an active yet mechani-
cally stable catalyst that can withstand the high-attrition environment of
the vortex reactor. Tharakaraman recently demonstrated that using SiC
along with the conventional Sr–La catalyst (without binders), oxidative
coupling of methane could be performed in a vortex reactor at 850
C
[140]. Silicon carbide provided the necessary mechanical strength and
desired porosity for catalytic activity [246]. The use of SiC as a support
for OCM has already been established in the literature [247,248], and a
recent demonstration in vortex reactors further encourages translating
this information to other relevant processes and scales.

◦

To achieve these broader aims, the shape-memory synthesis method
for beta-SiC synthesis introduced by Phaam-Huu et al. [249] presented a
unique opportunity to synthesize more extensive catalytic supports
without the need to use binders to enlarge the catalyst size required for
industrial-level reactors. By avoiding binders, the structural integrity of
catalysts is enforced, even under high shear and attrition, which benefits
advanced fluidized reactors such as the vortex, TORBEDS, and others.
introducing binders for larger catalytic pellets might
Additionally,
adversely affect other relevant physical properties, such as the thermal
conductivity of the resulting catalyst, which could be detrimental to the
process, especially if there is a mismatch in the physical properties of the
binder and the support/active phase. SiC without a binder, as synthe-
sized during the scaled-up SMS process, is also crucial for recovering

28

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 105 (2024) 101176

precious metals from a spent catalyst point of view [250]. This property
enhances the re-usability of the support, which is relevant for reactors
where catalyst size reduction by attrition leading to loss by entrainment
is a known issue, such as FBRs or even vortex reactors.

To develop catalysts that are more resistant to attrition, it is neces-
sary to understand the mechanism of attrition in vortex reactors. Attri-
tion occurs through three main routes of contact: gas-solid, solid-solid,
and solid-wall. However, the exact contributions of each of these modes
still need to be discovered, which is crucial for tailor-making resistant
materials for catalytic applications in vortex reactors.

5.3. Other process intensification opportunities

In addition to the considerations and perspectives mentioned earlier,
other opportunities for process intensification are common to all
multifunctional FBRs discussed in this review. We propose a strengths,
weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis to identify
them, as schematized in Fig. 24.

The multifunctional fluidized bed reactors presented in this review
reveal several advantages that can be translated into suitable industrial
opportunities. These multifunctional FBRs have the potential to modify
the CAPEX of a process by reducing the number of units necessary,
improving heat management, or operating with multiple streams
simultaneously. However, their feasibility remains open for discussion
due to their dependence on the specific case considered. Therefore, an
opportunity for multifunctional reactors lies in benchmarking a given
process with an existing, state-of-the-art industrial counterpart. Another
relevant opportunity to consider is reactor electrification, which ad-
dresses the increased interest in using renewable sources of energy by
making better use of heat, operating smaller units, and increasing the
versatility of these multifunctional designs. Both topics are discussed in
more detail later in this section.

There are opportunities to motivate the reduction of weaknesses. The
first relates to new technologies that avoid gas backmixing and simplify
reactor operation. However, this strategy would require strong resource

investment and may not be profitable in the short term. Similarly,
developing new multifunctional catalysts that operate in these reactors
looks promising, even though finding more robust and fluidizable ma-
terials simultaneously possessing catalytic activity would require great
effort. Establishing benchmarks is another aspect to consider because
they directly compare traditional and intensified processes. Lastly, it is
mandatory to develop specialized multiscale modeling tools that reduce
investment in designing and building replicas of these reactors, as well
as provide useful data across different scales. Many of these aspects
appear circular, meaning solving one problem would likely lead to a
possible solution for the next challenge. For example, developing
multiscale-multiphase modeling tools would not only provide a deeper
understanding of the reactor/process but also provide quantifiable av-
enues for a head-to-head comparison with current industrial standards, a
requirement for benchmarking.

Strategies that minimize weaknesses and avoid threats are crucial
when developing new technologies. The most direct strategy includes
simplifying current designs, which can reduce distrust about using new,
intensified systems while helping the industry familiarize itself with
them. Divulging previous successful cases can also achieve this goal,
which is our objective with this review. Finally, life cycle assessment
(LCA) studies can provide some context to the decision-making process
when implementing large-scale reactor technologies, particularly for
high-emissions processes. This approach allows for a more closed-loop
comparison from reactants to products and can be presented for high-
level decision-making.

These multifunctional reactors have several advantages that can help
overcome the challenges to their implementation. On one hand, it is
crucial to demonstrate the applicability of these systems to a wide range
of processes and to develop expertise in them, both experimentally and
computationally. These two strategies are closely related and can be
achieved simultaneously by incorporating multifunctional FBRs into
conferences, publications, or even classrooms. On the other hand,
reducing both capital and operating costs should be a top priority. This
could be achieved by reducing capital costs (using lower volume units

with more efficient energy supply methods) or by decreasing operating
costs (recycling reactants or products, reducing energy requirements,
reducing the number of operating units, or improving overall heat
management). Finally, one of the most important strategies is the
implementation of carbon capture, storage, and utilization steps. This
could be achieved by adding subsequent steps downstream or directly
incorporating them into the multifunctional reactor design. However,
both approaches involve additional costs that must be carefully
considered to avoid the emergence of new weaknesses and threats.

Among these strategies, cost analysis (CAPEX and OPEX), electrifi-
cation, and CCSU are currently in focus because they aim towards cur-
rent global trends.

5.3.1. CAPEX and OPEX

Cost estimation is one of the most useful tools for analyzing the
feasibility of a proposed process and identifying areas where process
intensification could be successfully applied. CAPEX and OPEX estima-
tions serve as key tools for decision-making, especially in cases involving
unconventional technologies like the multifunctional reactors discussed
in this review. From the viewpoint of systems that carry out more than
one process in the same vessel, opposite forces affect capital cost esti-
mation, such as the TZFBR or ICFBR. Although reducing the number of
units required to perform the same processes could have a positive
impact, the complexity of these designs might increase costs in the
design and fabrication stages. This could also apply to vortex reactors,
where higher production rates per unit of reactor volume are possible.
Even though this could decrease CAPEX, the higher gas velocity needed
for the appropriate fluidization regime could negatively impact OPEX.
However, CAPEX and OPEX can vary significantly for the vortex reactor
if the fluidization gas differs from the reactant gas. In the case of biomass
pyrolysis, where N2 is the inert fluidization gas requiring recycling after
separation, this adds to both CAPEX and OPEX. For systems with
favorable heat management, such as vortex or TZFBR and ICFBR oper-
ating in a reaction-regeneration mode, achieving lower fuel consump-
tion and energy losses may be possible, significantly affecting OPEX.

5.3.2. Electrification

Electrification of chemical processes is a key goal the chemical in-
dustry has pursued in recent years. From all stages comprising a
chemical process, the reactor stage offers a key opportunity for electri-
fication [251,252]. Besides using electricity indirectly (e.g., electro-
lyzing water to produce hydrogen used as fuel) or applying power to
non-catalytic systems (plasma gas reactors [253–255]),
there are
several ways to electrify FBRs. These are shown in Fig. 25.

Systems based on the Joule effect produce heat through electrical
losses, similar to how a resistance generates heat when an electric cur-
rent passes through it [256–259]. These systems can utilize the reactor
body as a source of heat (Fig. 25a and e), reducing temperature profiles
from radiation-convection in the fired chamber and conduction through
the reactor wall, which are currently the predominant methods (d). An
alternative system follows a similar concept but uses the catalyst bed as a
resistance [260–262]. In this approach, the bed closes the circuit be-
tween the reactor body and a metallic rod at its center, acting as an
anode-cathode. When a current is applied between the metallic parts,
the dielectric material formulated into the catalyst produces heat similar
to a resistance (f). Other strategies could provide energy by utilizing
radiating microwaves into the reactor (b). Although the heating is
localized in this case, the catalyst bed must be able to absorb them and
produce heat; thus, it must be dielectric [263]. Microwaves can be
emitted from the exterior (g) or interior (h) of the reactor body. In the
first case, the reactor wall needs to be an insulator, such as quartz or
glass, to permeate the radiation, while in the second case, it could be a
metallic material that reflects radiation back to the bed, thereby
increasing heating efficiency. The last strategy is based on the induction
phenomena (c), the heat produced by spinning magnetic moments under
the effect of an alternating magnetic field [251,256,257]. This method

of providing energy involves using a coil to generate an alternating
magnetic field and a ferromagnetic material to be heated by it. Although
generating the magnetic field is straightforward, the choice of ferro-
magnetic material can be based on a metallic reactor body (i) or a
ferromagnetic catalyst (j), depending on the desired temperature profile.
It is important to consider that the intensity of the magnetic field
generated by the coil decreases radially, leading to an outward heating
profile if the heating source is the ferromagnetic catalyst. However, this
profile is likely to be smoother than that produced when heating the
reactor wall because the heating is targeted where it is most needed.

These strategies not only enable the substitution of traditional
burners, leading to lower fuel consumption and emissions, but also
result in smoother temperature profiles, extended lifetimes of materials,
and sometimes improved performance. Additionally, replacing the
external furnace with a quartz-based material allows visual access to the
reactors, which is typically impossible with conventional heating
sources.

5.3.3. Carbon capture, storage, and utilization (CCSU)

CCSU is a mitigation technology that aims to reduce the impact of
carbon-based emissions from the chemical industry. Although it is one of
the pillars supporting current trends, its tandem development with the
reactor technology is far behind the industry’s needs. CCSU consists of
three main parts: capturing carbon-related emissions where they are
produced, their transport and storage, and/or their use for several
purposes. Carbon capture is typically conducted on-site through chem-
ical or physicochemical processes (e.g., adsorption) of the flue gas,
which usually contains only around 10 % COx, depending on its source
(e.g., fuel combustion or process streams). While the common approach
involves a gas separation stage through sorption, it is essential to
consider the energy demand of this stage, which increases with the
dilution of COx in the stream. Therefore, carbon capture processes are
more energy-efficient when the flue gas has a high COx concentration
[264]. In addition to the energy cost of capturing COx, factors such as
solubility, density, reactivity, heat capacity, and pressure sensitivity are
also critical and could influence the choice of capture technology for
stage,
each process
carbon-based pollutants can be managed through various methods,
including sequestration in deep geological reservoirs, mineral carbon-
ation into thermodynamically stable carbonates, or ocean storage [267,
268]. Although this strategy is crucial in CCSU strategies, its discussion
is beyond the scope of this work due to its limited relation to reactor
technology. Carbon utilization involves using streams derived from the
carbon separation and capture steps, either totally or partially. The state
of these carbon streams (solid, slurry, or gas phases) will determine the
most suitable strategy. Direct utilization of carbon-rich gaseous streams
in chemical synthesis is particularly attractive because it provides a
cost-effective and abundant C1 feedstock. Promising applications
include dry reforming of methane, methanol production by hydroge-
nation, dimethyl carbonate synthesis, and oxidative dehydrogenation of
ethane [265,268].

separation/capture

[265,266]. After

the

The use of CCSU technologies alongside multifunctional fluidized
beds opens up a whole new question concerning their feasibility,
depending on the system. Applying CCSU technologies to the TZFBR
design could be challenging due to the dilution of the gas stream in the
interzone. At that point, gases from the bottom zone mix with those fed
to the upper zone, which increases the energy cost of the separation and
capture stage. However, improved TZFBR designs can operate with
embedded membranes, enabling in situ COx separation and producing
highly concentrated streams. Optimizing this strategy involves equip-
ping each reactor zone with its membranes, which is particularly rele-
vant considering the high COx production in the lower zone typically
designated for catalyst regeneration. This approach enhances the sepa-
ration and capture stage, making the process more efficient and poten-
tially feasible. Moreover, the catalyst regeneration can be performed
with CO2, allowing the recycling of a fraction of the separated flue gas

back to the bottom zone to produce a mixture of CO2 and O2 as a
regenerative stream. Vortex reactors can directly sequester CO2 by using
an alkali to replace the solid phase, providing a high interfacial area for
gas-liquid contact and converting CO2 into other chemicals more
effectively than previously discussed technologies. In terms of CO2
separation in gas-solid-based reactive applications, the complexity of
separation varies depending on the similarity of feed and fluidization gas
and downstream reactor concentrations. The physical separation in
ICFBR chambers allows for the production of streams with different COx
concentrations, making the application of CCSU technologies more
feasible for gas-solid applications than in the TZFBR or vortex reactor.
Unlike the latter, the flue gas obtained in the ICFBR is not mixed with
gases in the reaction chamber, meaning it is not diluted and can be sent
directly to a capture stage, concentrated with membranes, or partially
recycled to the regeneration chamber.

6. Conclusions

Multifunctional fluidized reactors, such as the TZFBR, ICFBR, and
vortex reactor, offer advanced technologies that overcome the limita-
tions of traditional fluidized beds and allow for multiple processes
within a single vessel. These reactors have the potential for process
intensification, space reduction, and cost and energy savings.

Among these reactors, the TZFBR is particularly notable for its ability
to operate efficiently over extended periods due to simultaneous reac-
tion and regeneration within the same vessel, making it an alternative
for chemical processes prone to catalyst deactivation. However, despite
its advantages, no industry has implemented the TZFBR since its first
description over 40 years ago. This lack of implementation could be due
to factors such as the complexity associated with the design and oper-
ation of fluidized solid-gas catalytic systems, the risk of explosion
associated with feeding oxygen to a hydrocarbon mixture, or the ease of
access to other well-established technologies. Nevertheless, certain
factors could facilitate the implementation of the TZFBR on an industrial
scale. These include the many successful processes tested in the TZFBR,
the extended knowledge of the system after over 40 years of research,
the advantages it offers in different designs (e.g., two-section reactors or
coupling them with membranes), and the possibility of substituting
regenerative streams such as H2O or CO2 for oxygen. Although imple-
menting this reactor could decrease CAPEX by reducing the number of
units required to complete a process, the complex design of the TZFBR
might increase capital costs in the design and build phases. Additionally,
this multifunctional fluidized bed is distinguished by its superior heat
management, which could lower energy consumption and, conse-
quently, operating costs. Considering these factors, the TZFBR could
garner interest for certain industrial applications. Once adopted on an
industrial scale, its adoption could encourage others to follow suit,
potentially making it a standard technology.

incorporating continuous

Vortex reactors are beneficial for thermally sensitive reactions and in
situ separations of dissimilar solids, as they overcome gravitational
forces and promote efficient gas-solid or gas-liquid heat and mass
transfer. With improved designs
solids
feeding-removal and the development of robust catalysts, these reactors
hold promise for widespread applications in the chemical industry.
ICFBRs emerge as promising technologies for solid-gas catalytic re-
actions, offering the advantage of producing 2 atm with different reac-
tant and product concentrations, thereby enhancing operational safety
and accessibility. Furthermore, new designs solve some of the most
relevant solid movement problems of these reactor configurations,
increasing their appeal for new reactions and processes. Implementing
ICFBR technology could be an attractive alternative to other methods,
and the possibility of coupling them with other technologies (e.g., riser-
downer, TZFBR, or membranes) makes ICFBRs a beacon for process
intensification.
