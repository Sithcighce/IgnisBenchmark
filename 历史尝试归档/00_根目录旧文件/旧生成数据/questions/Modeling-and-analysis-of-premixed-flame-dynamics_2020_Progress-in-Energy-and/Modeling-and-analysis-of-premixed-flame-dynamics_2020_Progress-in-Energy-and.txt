The unsteady response of a ﬂame to acoustic or ﬂow perturbations plays a crucial role in thermoacoustic 
combustion instability. The majority of studies on this subject presents and analyzes ﬂame dynamics in 
the frequency domain by means of a ﬂame transfer function or a ﬂame describing function. The present 
review concentrates on work that adopts a time-domain perspective. In such a framework, the linear 
dynamics of an acoustically compact ﬂame is completely characterized by its impulse response . The con- 
cept of distributed time delays emerges as an appropriate description of the convective transport of ﬂow 
and ﬂame perturbations. A time-domain perspective facilitates the physics-based interpretation of impor- 
tant features of the ﬂame response and supports the development of passive or active means of stability 
control. 

The present review ﬁrst provides mathematical background on linear time-invariant systems and intro- 
duces the impulse response as a quantity that fully characterizes the dynamics of such systems. It will 
then be shown by way of example how typical features of the frequency response of premixed ﬂames 
can be generated in a very natural, physically intuitive manner from time delay distributions. Analytical 
results for the impulse response of laminar premixed ﬂames to modulations of velocity or equivalence 
ratio are presented in a uniﬁed framework. The next chapter discusses low-order parametric models, 
which exploit prior knowledge on the underlying convective processes that govern the ﬂame dynamics, 
but nevertheless require input from experiment or high-ﬁdelity simulation to ﬁx parameter values. Next, 
a variety of approaches devised to derive distributed time delay models of ﬂame dynamics from simula- 
tion data are reviewed. The most recent developments, which combine large eddy simulation of turbulent 
combustion with system identiﬁcation, have demonstrated that it is possible to estimate reduced-order 
models of ﬂame dynamics that are quantitatively accurate even for complex, swirling ﬂame in geome- 
tries of technical interest. The last chapter reviews work on acoustically non-compact ﬂames, strategies 
for passive control of thermoacoustic instabilities that exploit distributed delays, and the effect of con- 
vective dispersion on the time delay distribution and strength of entropy waves.

1. Introduction 

Thermoacoustic  combustion  instabilities  are  a  cause  for  con- 
cern in combustion applications as diverse as rocket engines, gas 
turbines, or domestic heaters [1–5] . Such instabilities can lead to 
severe  mechanical  or  thermal  damage,  even  catastrophic  failure 
of a combustor. Increased emissions of noise and pollutants—such 
as oxides of nitrogen, soot, or carbon monoxide—may also result. 
Thermoacoustic instabilities are notoriously diﬃcult to predict and 
control, their occurrence depends in a very sensitive manner on 
many factors, such as operating and environmental conditions, fuel 
properties or geometrical detail of combustor elements, e.g., fuel 
injectors  or  cooling  liners  [6] .  The  design  of  successful  counter- 
measures requires expert knowledge, but is nevertheless often a 
matter of trial and error—which may be tremendously expensive. 
For  example,  during  the  development  of  the  Saturn  V  launcher, 
NASA  carried  out  several  thousand  full-scale  engine  tests  in  or- 
der to eliminate thermoacoustic combustion instabilities in the F1 
ﬁrst stage engine [1,4] . Nowadays, thermoacoustic instabilities pose 
a  severe  challenge  for  developing  reliable,  ﬂexible,  low-emission 

combustion technology, in particular gas turbines for power gen- 
eration and propulsion [2,3,5] . 

Thermoacoustic combustion instabilities are not only a very se- 
vere technological challenge, they are also a most fascinating phe- 
nomenon. A wide variety of physical effects in compressible, re- 
acting turbulent ﬂow interact with each other over scales ranging 
from fractions of a millimeter (reaction zone of a ﬂame) to several 
meters  (acoustic  wavelengths  at  low  frequencies).  Thermoacous- 
tic instabilities are regarded as self-excited instabilities that result 
from interactions between ﬂow, ﬂame and acoustics in feedback. 
The  ﬂame  dynamics ,  i.e.,  the  dynamic  response  of  ﬂame  shape, 
ﬂame  position  and  in  particular  ﬂame  heat  release  rate  to  ﬂow 
perturbations, plays a crucial role in this feedback loop. Flame dy- 
namics is predominantly described in the frequency domain. Merk 
[7] wrote, “In studying unstable combustion we have to know how 
the  ﬂuctuations  in  the  heat  production  depend  on  the  ﬂuctua- 
tion conditions of the gas ﬂow” and characterized this dependence 
in  terms  of  “transfer  functions”,  which  describe  the  response  of 
the heat source to ﬂuctuations in temperature, pressure, density 
and—most importantly—velocity of the gas ﬂow upstream of the 
ﬂame [8] . Introducing the transfer function w.r.t. velocity ﬂuctua-

A related characteristic is the frequency response F ( ω), which 
can  be  evaluated  as  the  transfer  function  F (ω)  for  real-valued 
ω ∈ R .  If  the  functional  form  of  the  transfer  function  F is  not 
known, the frequency response F ( ω) can be determined from sam- 
pled input and output data u (cid:5) (k (cid:5)t ) ,  ˙ Q (cid:5) (k (cid:5)t ) , k = 1 , . . . , N for the 
case of harmonic forcing 1 at real-valued frequency ω. 

Since the seminal work of Merk [7,8] , a very large number of 
studies on ﬂame dynamics have been published. The frequency re- 
sponse of a ﬂame can be measured in experiment—see e.g., [11–
20] —or determined from computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD) sim- 
ulation of reacting ﬂow [11,21–24] . Kinematic models of premixed 
ﬂame  dynamics  concentrate  on  the  changes  in  ﬂame  shape  and 
ﬂame surface area that result from disturbing the kinematic bal- 
ance between premixture ﬂow velocity and ﬂame speed [11,12,25–
28] .  Other  studies  consider  the  response  of  practical  premixed 
ﬂames  to  modulations  of  the  air  excess  ratio  of  the  premixture 
[29–33] . Swirl ﬂames are ubiquitous in technical applications, pe- 
culiarities  of  their  dynamics  are  discussed,  e.g.,  in  [16,18,20,34] . 
Heuristic  models  were  proposed  that  strive  to  integrate  several 
ﬂow/ﬂame interaction mechanisms [14,15,35,36] . 

The short review of publications on ﬂame dynamics given in 
the  previous  paragraph  is  far  from  exhaustive.  There  are  several 
review articles and books that cover these developments in great 
breadth  and  depth  [2,3,28,37,38] . What  is  important  in  the  con- 
text of the present review is that the studies mentioned above de- 
scribe ﬂame dynamics in terms of the ﬂame transfer function or 
the  ﬂame  frequency  response,  i.e.,  in  the  frequency  domain .  This 
is presumably so because ﬁrstly measurements of the response of 
a ﬂame to external (harmonic) excitation are conveniently repre- 
sented in Bode plots, which depict the gain and phase of the fre- 
quency response, and secondly because linear stability analysis is 
usually carried out in the frequency domain, such that the growth 
rate of eigenmodes is obtained as the imaginary part of a complex- 
valued eigenfrequency ω n [39–41] . 

This review adopts a different perspective: Flame dynamics is 
represented  in  the  time  domain ,  frequently  in  terms  of  the  im- 
pulse response or the step response of the ﬂame. A concept that 
arises very naturally in this context is that of distributed time delays 
(DTD): the response of the ﬂame does not occur instantaneously at 
the moment when a perturbation is imposed, or at some later in- 
stance in time, but instead is spread out over an interval of time. 
As shall be shown in subsequent sections, experimental or compu- 
tational results as well as low-order models can be conveniently 
represented and formulated in such a framework [42] . 

Flames are convection-diffusion-reaction systems. The convec- 
tive transport of the respective perturbations of ﬂame shape, vor- 
ticity and equivalence ratio are understood to play a crucial role 
in ﬂame dynamics. A time-domain representation in terms of dis- 
tributed delays corresponds in a very natural manner to the ﬂow 
physics of convectively transported disturbances and can provide 
important  insight  in  ﬂow-ﬂame  interaction  mechanisms.  For  ex- 
ample, one can “read off” important time scales from the distri- 
bution  of time  delays. Characteristics of  the ﬂame frequency re- 
sponse, such as local minima or maxima of gain, can be explained 
in a straightforward manner in terms of corresponding features of 
the time delay distribution.

Note that the continuation of a frequency response F ( ω) away from the real axis 
is not a trivial matter, see e.g. [9] or [10] , Section 5.2 and 5.3. Further discussion of 
this point is found in Section 2.1.3 .

It  is  convenient  that  a  representation  of  ﬂame  dynamics  in 
terms of distributed delays can be transformed to the frequency 
domain in a straightforward manner. This greatly facilitates the in- 
tegration of such models into a variety of thermo-acoustic mod- 
eling  approaches  for  transient  simulation  as  well  as  linear  sta- 
bility  analysis.  Furthermore,  the  derivation  of  analytical  mod- 
els for the impulse or step responses of idealized conﬁgurations 
of  premixed  ﬂames  is  arguably  simpler  than  the  corresponding 
frequency-domain formulations. Likewise, the identiﬁcation of lin- 
ear, reduced-order models of ﬂame dynamics from CFD time series 
data in terms of the impulse or step response is computationally 
more eﬃcient than a frequency-by-frequency determination of the 
frequency response function. 

The presentation of ideas and methods in this manuscript does 
not follow the chronology of developments. Instead, in the hope 
of making essential concepts and methods more accessible, a more 
pedagogical approach is followed. The next chapter presents math- 
ematical background on linear time-invariant systems and intro- 
duces the impulse response as a quantity that fully characterized 
the dynamic of such systems. It will then be shown by way of ex- 
ample how typical features of the frequency response of premixed 
ﬂames can be generated in a very natural, physically intuitive man- 
ner from time delay distributions. The third chapter presents ana- 
lytical results for the impulse response of laminar premixed ﬂames. 
Various  geometrical  conﬁgurations  are  discussed,  the  impact  of 
ﬂuctuations  of  equivalence  ratio  on  premixed  ﬂame  dynamics  is 
included. It is shown that results are not only fully equivalent to 
established frequency-domain representations, but help to develop 
additional insight on relevant time scales and interaction mecha- 
nisms. Chapter 4 reviews a wide variety of  reduced-order, para- 
metric  “gray  box” models  of  ﬂame  dynamics.  These  models  are 
“gray” because they exploit prior knowledge of the underlying con- 
vective processes that govern the dynamics. The time delays that 
result from convective transport of fuel from the injector to the 
ﬂame play a central role here, but other aspects such as perturba- 
tions of ﬂame shape or swirl number are also considered. Nonlin- 
ear extensions also ﬁnd mention. The subsequent chapter reviews 
a variety of approaches that were developed to deduce distributed 
time delay models of ﬂame dynamics from CFD data. Especially the 
more  recent  developments,  which  are  based  on  large  eddy  sim- 
ulation  (LES)  of  turbulent  reactive  ﬂow,  have  demonstrated  that 
it is possible to estimate in this manner reduced-order models of 
ﬂame dynamics that are quantitatively accurate even for complex, 
swirling ﬂames in geometries of technical interest. Chapter 6 re- 
views a selection of papers that utilize the concept of distributed 
delays in the analysis of ﬂame dynamics and thermoacoustic insta- 
bility. First, Section 6.1 is concerned with acoustically non-compact 
ﬂames.  Distributed  lags  have  long  been  regarded  as  a  means  of 
passive control of thermoacoustic combustion instabilities. Indeed, 
interest in controlling the distribution of lags and quantifying the 
impact of wider distributions on stability margins prompted many 
of the developments discussed in this manuscript. This material is 
reviewed in Section 6.2 . Finally, effects of convective dispersion on 
the time delay distribution and the strength of entropy waves are 
described in Section 6.3 . 

This review focuses on the dynamics of premixed deﬂagrating 
ﬂames—because thermoacoustic combustion instabilities are most 
problematic for this type of ﬂame. But the reader should note that 
many concepts and methods discussed are applicable also to other 
types of ﬂames. Pertinent results on spray ﬂames and ﬂames dom- 
inated by auto-ignition are thus discussed occasionally. 

This introduction closes with a caveat: the present manuscript 
does  not  attempt  to  give  a  comprehensive  review  of  the  liter- 
ature  on  ﬂame  dynamics.  The  discussion  concentrates  on  stud- 
ies that adopt a time-domain perspective, such that the distribu- 
tion of time delays and in particular the impulse response make 

an  explicit  appearance.  Nevertheless,  publications  that  adopt  a 
frequency-domain  perspective  and  make  use  of  the  correspond- 
ing methods are cited and discussed in order to establish context 
or contrast with the time-domain representation. Several studies 
that make only implicit use of the concept of distributed time de- 
lays are also included. It is hoped that after perusal of this review, 
the reader will agree that many aspects of ﬂame dynamics are ex- 
pressed in a physically intuitive and convenient fashion in terms 
of the impulse response, not the frequency response or the trans- 
fer function of a ﬂame [42] . 

2. Background and expository examples 

The ﬁrst section of this chapter establishes notation and gives 
basic deﬁnitions pertaining to linear, time-invariant (LTI) systems. 
In particular, it is shown that the impulse response function h of 
an LTI system can fully characterize its dynamics, i.e. knowledge of 
the impulse response suﬃces to predict the response of the system 
to any input signal. An equivalent description of system dynamics 
in the frequency domain is provided by the transfer function F (ω) , 
as introduced in Eq.  (1) for the special case of a ﬂame. Note that 
frequency ω ∈ C is a complex number. Its imaginary part describes 
the growth or decay rate of an oscillation 2 . 

Commonly,  linear  systems  are  characterized  in  terms  of  im- 
pulse, step or frequency responses. Impulse, step and frequency re- 
sponses are important properties of LTI systems, but are not neces- 
sarily system models as such. For example, the frequency response 
F may be determined by evaluating the response of a system to 
harmonic excitation at a set of discrete frequencies. This can be 
done in experiment, or by numerical simulation in the time do- 
main. Provided that the transfer function F is known in analytic 
form,  the  frequency  response  F  may  simply  be  evaluated  as  the 
transfer function F at real-valued frequencies ω ∈ R . Similar con- 
siderations hold for impulse and step responses, as will be detailed 
below. 

In the combustion dynamics community many authors use the 
terms  ﬂame  transfer  function  (FTF)  and  ﬂame  frequency  response 
(FFR) interchangeably. The author of the present paper admits that 
he also has done so in early studies—but this is strictly speaking 
not correct: Obviously, if one knows the transfer function, which 
one should regard as a complete system model , one also knows the 
frequency  response—which  is  an  important  system  property .  The 
opposite is not true: For example, knowledge of the frequency re- 
sponse F is not suﬃcient to accurately predict the response to an 
excitation signal that grows with time [9,10] . See also the discus- 
sion in Section 2.1.3 . 

The frequency response F ( ω) of a ﬂame often exhibits charac- 
teristic features such as an overall low-pass behavior, possibly with 
excess gain | F ( ω)| > 1 or pronounced local minima in gain at cer- 
tain  frequencies.  The  phase  arg( F ( ω)),  which  expresses  to  which 
extent the system response lags the excitation signal for the case 
of harmonic excitation at frequency ω, typically shows an overall 
decrease that is almost linear in frequency, but may exhibit pro- 
nounced  jumps  at  those  frequencies  where  the  gain  is  minimal. 
Section 2.2 illustrates by example how such characteristic features 
of the FFR can be generated in a very natural manner from impulse 
responses. 

This chapter closes with a short discussion of the physical ori- 
gins of distributed delays in ﬂame dynamics and a critical assess- 
ment of the assumption that the response of a ﬂame to acoustic or 
ﬂow perturbations may be described as an LTI system. 

Before  going  into  the  mathematical  details,  a  comment  on 
nomenclature is appropriate. In the literature on system identiﬁ-

cation and signal processing, DTD models are known as ﬁnite im- 
pulse  response  (FIR)  models.  In  combustion  dynamics,  the  terms 
distributed time delay or distributed time lag have often been used 
instead, suggesting to the reader that this type of model may be 
interpreted as a generalization of the ubiquitous n - τ model (see 
below), which one would characterize as a pure delay or single time 
delay model. 

Overall, the terms time lag and time delay have been used inter- 
changeably in the literature on combustion dynamics. For example, 
in the seminal papers [43,44] , the authors discuss a time lag τ that 
results from mixing delay . In the recent literature the parameter τ
of the n - τ model is frequently referred to as the time delay . When 
presenting and discussing other authors’ work, the present author 
in general follows the nomenclature used in the respective publi- 
cation and thus uses the terms lag and delay interchangeably. 

In the literature on system identiﬁcation and signal processing, 
on the other hand, the term delay or pure delay often refers to the 
time taken for the system to generate its ﬁrst response to an input, 
while lag describes the transient or dynamical part ( post-delay ) of 
the system response. Lag in general changes the signal shape, while 
pure delay does not. Distributed time delays as discussed in this re- 
view might be called delay-plus-dynamics , or delay-plus-lag . In con- 
sideration of these conventions—which are not universal—this re- 
view speaks of distributed time delay models, because a distributed 
time lag seems to be a pleonasm. 

2.1. Mathematical background on linear, time-invariant systems 

In  this  section,  basic  deﬁnitions  and  results  concerning  lin- 
ear,  time-invariant  systems  are  summarized,  for  further  details 
the  reader  is  referred  to  [10,45–49] .  These  ideas  and  methods 
have been developed not only in the context of digital ﬁlter con- 
struction in signal processing (typical applications are communi- 
cations,  speech  processing,  speech  or  music  synthesis,  etc.),  but 
are also related to control theory. In these applications, a discrete- 
time  formulation  is  often  adopted;  the  presentation  in  this  sec- 
tion does likewise. The connection to continuous (real-world) pro- 
cesses should be obvious—sampling of continuous (experimental) 
data produces a sequence of discrete (equally-spaced in time) data 
values.  In  any  case,  corresponding  continuous-time  formulations 
are also popular and indeed were used in some of the studies that 
shall be reviewed in later sections. 

As illustrated in Fig. 1 (top), a discrete-time system with time 
increment (cid:5)t may be deﬁned as any model or algorithm which 
produces from an input sequence (the signal ): 
s = (s 

l ) = (s [ l(cid:5)t]) , l = 0 , . . . , N 

(2) 

an output sequence r (the response ), 

s → r . 

(3) 

A linear, time-invariant (LTI) system has the following property: 
if s (1) → r (1) and s (2) → r (2) for two arbitrary input sequences s (1) , 
s (2) , then for arbitrary constants a, b and for all “offsets” l 

0 : 

(1) + bs 

(2) → a r 

(1) + br 

a s

(linearity) , 

(4) 

The response to this particular signal is known as the unit impulse 
response h (or unit sample response ). 

If the impulse response h of a system is known, it is possible to 
compute the response r to any signal s as a convolution of impulse 
response and signal: 

+ ∞ (cid:3) 

l = 
r 

k s 
h 

l−k . 

k = −∞ 

(7) 

This result is quite obvious, if one regards the signal s as a super- 
position of impulses e (0) imposed at times l with weights s 
l , 

+ ∞ (cid:3) 

k δ
s 

lk . 

l = 
s 

k = −∞ 

(8) 

In this sense, the impulse response h characterizes an LTI system 
completely; a formal proof is found in [45] or [48] . 

The impulse response of continuous-time systems is known as 
the Green’s function G and represents the response to a Dirac- δ
signal.  The  response  to  an  arbitrary  signal  may  be  computed  as 
a convolution integral over the Green’s function G and the signal 
history. 

2.1.2. Transfer function of LTI systems 

Even though discrete-time systems are formulated in the time 
domain,  it  is  often  helpful  to  develop  a  frequency-domain  rep- 
l = e iω(cid:5)t l , 
resentation. Consider a special class of inputs signals s 
which may be regarded as a sinusoid of frequency ω sampled with 
a time step (cid:5)t . 

When applied to an LTI system, the resulting output is: 

+ ∞ (cid:3) 

l = 
r 

k e iω(cid:5)t (l−k ) = e iω(cid:5)t l 
h 

+ ∞ (cid:3) 

−iω(cid:5)t k . 

k e 
h 

k = −∞ 

k = −∞ 

Introducing the transfer function : 

+ ∞ (cid:3) 

F (ω) ≡

−iω(cid:5)t k , 

k e 
h 

k = −∞ 

of the system, this result may be rewritten as follows: 
r(ω) = F (ω ) s (ω ) . 

(9) 

(10) 

(11) 

In other words, the response is also sinusoidal with the same fre- 
quency ω as the input, but with a different amplitude and phase, 
as described by the complex-valued, frequency-dependent multi- 
plicative factor F (ω) . 

The transfer function F (ω) has the following properties: 

• The frequency ω appears in the term exp (−iω(cid:5)t k ) on the right 
hand side of (10) , therefore the transfer function F is periodic 
in ω with period 2 π / (cid:5)t . 

• If  the  signal  s 

l  is  purely  real,  then  the  absolute  value  of  the 
transfer function F is symmetric about the points ω = 0 and 
ω = π / (cid:5)t, while the phase of the transfer function is antisym- 
metric. 

For real-valued signals, it suﬃces therefore to specify the trans- 
fer function in the interval ω(cid:5)t  = 0 → π (normalized angular fre- 
quency) or  f = 0 → 1 / 2(cid:5)t (frequency). The upper limit of this fre- 
quency range is the well-known Nyquist frequency . In principle, in- 
k , −∞ < k < + ∞ are required to fully 
ﬁnitely many coeﬃcients h

(13) 

k = −∞ 

specify the transfer function. Of course, in practice a good estimate 
can often be obtained with a small number of coeﬃcients (“low- 
order ﬁlter”). 

2.1.3. z -Transform 

The z-Transform of a sequence s is deﬁned for a complex num- 

ber z as: 

ˆ S (z) = 

+ ∞ (cid:3) 

−k . 

k z 
s 

k = −∞ 

(12) 

With (10) we see that the transfer function F of an LTI system is 
equal to the z -transform of its impulse response h with argument 
z = e iω(cid:5)t . 

F (ω) =  ˆ H (e iω(cid:5)t ) = 

+ ∞ (cid:3) 

−iω(cid:5)t k . 

k e 
h 

k = −∞ 

Note  that  this  expression  may  be  evaluated  also  for  complex- 
valued frequencies ω ∈ C . In other words, an FTF computed as the 
z -transform of the impulse response can be evaluated throughout 
the complex plane. This is an important requirement for thermo- 
acoustic stability analysis, where a non-zero imaginary part of an 
eigenfrequency ω n indicates growth or decay of the corresponding 
eigenmode [9,24,50–54] . 

The result (13) for the FTF at complex-valued frequencies, i.e. 
for  a  mode  that  grows  or  decays  with  time,  allows  an  intuitive 
interpretation: Consider, for the sake of the argument, an oscilla- 
tion with growing amplitude. With the sign convention exp (+ iωt) 
used in this paper, the imaginary part of the frequency is negative 
(cid:3) ( ω) < 0 in this case and the exponential terms in the convolution 
sum on the r.h.s. of (13) have magnitudes exp ( (cid:3) ( ω) (cid:5)tk ) < 1. It fol- 
lows that respective weights of the impulse response coeﬃcients 
h 
k in the convolution sum decrease with increasing k . This means 
that the recent history (small k ) contributes comparably more to 
the present system response than the earlier history (large k ). This 
makes perfect sense, because for an oscillation that is growing in 
time, recent input is stronger than input that lies farther in the 
past. 

Also note, an FTF computed via Eq.  (13) is guaranteed to be 
a  holomorphic  function  in  C ,  which  facilitates  the  application  of 
non-iterative methods based on a generalized argument principle 
to ﬁnd all thermoacoustic eigenmodes within a given region of the 
complex plane [52,55] . 

2.1.4. Inverse z -Transform 

Since  the  transfer  function  is  periodic  in  [ −π / (cid:5)t, π / (cid:5)t] , 
Eq. (13) suggests that the coeﬃcients h 
k of the impulse response 
may be interpreted as the series coeﬃcients of the Fourier series 
representation of the transfer function F (ω) . This implies the fol- 
lowing deﬁnition for an inverse z-transform : 

k = 
h 

(cid:5)t 
2 π

(cid:4) + π / (cid:5)t 

−π / (cid:5)t 

F (ω ) e iω(cid:5)t k 

dω , 

(14) 

(actually the inverse Fourier transform of the ﬂame transfer func- 
tion). 

One concludes that both the unit impulse response h and the 
transfer  function  F (ω)  characterize  completely  a  discrete-time, 
time-invariant linear system and can be converted into each other 
with the (inverse) z -transform. 

It  has  been  remarked  above  that  for  thermoacoustic  stability 
analysis, the ﬂame transfer function F must be known throughout 
the complex domain [9,24,50–54] . In order to “extend” a ﬂame fre- 
quency response F ( ω n ) measured at several real-valued frequencies 
ω n ∈ R , n = 1 , . . . , N into the complex domain, Tay-Wo-Chong et al. 
[50] and Macquisten et al. [51] have computed the ﬂame impulse 
k  from the frequency response F ( ω n ) with 
response coeﬃcients h 

the inverse z -Transform, and then evaluated the FTF F (ω) for ar- 
bitrary, complex-valued frequencies ω as the forward z -transform 3 . 

2.1.5. Stability and causality 

The impulse response h allows assessment of the stability of a 
system [10] , where it is understood that an LTI system is bounded- 
input, bounded-output stable (”BIBO stable”) if all bounded inputs 
yield bounded outputs: 
l | ≤ M r , M r < ∞ for all | s 
| r 
With (7) one deduces that any LTI system is BIBO stable if and only 
if the impulse response is absolutely convergent, 
+ ∞ (cid:3) 

l | ≤ M s , M s < ∞ 

(15) 

(16) 

An LTI system is causal (or realizable ) if its output r 

l  at time 
l = l 0 depends only on values of the input at earlier times l ≤ l 
0 , 
i.e., the present state of the output depends only on present and 
l = 0 for l < 0—
previous states of the system. This implies that h 
only the past and the present should inﬂuence the present! It fol- 
lows that for an LTI system that respects causality the sum over 
the index k runs only from 0 to ∞ : 

∞ (cid:3) 

F (ω) = 

−iω(cid:5)t k . 

k e 
h 

(17) 

k =0 

2.1.6. Quasi-steady limit 

Polifke and Lawn [56] considered the response of a premixed 
ﬂame  to  quasi-steady  ﬂow  perturbations  and  showed  that  con- 
straints on the transfer function between ﬂuctuations of velocity 
and heat release result from global conservation of mass, energy, 
and momentum. For example, the low-frequency limit of the FTF 
of a velocity-sensitive, “perfectly premixed” ﬂame, where ﬂuctua- 
tions of equivalence ratio are absent, should be unity in the limit 
of zero frequency. Conversely, for a combustion system with con- 
stant mass ﬂow rate of fuel, the FTF should tend to zero in this 
limit. 

From Eq.  (13) one deduces immediately that the sum over the 
coeﬃcients  of  the  impulse  response  equals  the  FTF  at  zero  fre- 
quency: 

F ( ω ) = 

lim 
ω→ 0 

k = −∞ 

+ ∞ (cid:3) 

k = 0 , 
h 

(18) 

which implies that the conservation laws of thermo-ﬂuid dynamics 
impose a constraint not only on the frequency response, but also 
on the impulse response. 

2.1.7. Discrete-time vs. continuous-time formulation 

The  presentation  in  the  preceding  sub-sections  has  relied  on 
a  discrete-time  framework.  Indeed,  data-based  models  are  often 
formulated in discrete-time, since measurements are available in 
the form of sampled data, and unsteady CFD calculation proceeds 
in  discrete  time  steps.  Nevertheless,  there  are  situations  where 
continuous-time formulations are more convenient. For example, 
the analytical models for ﬂame response presented in Section 3 are 
formulated in continuous-time. There is strong correspondence be- 
tween continuous-time and discrete-time models: convolution in- 
tegrals are used in lieu of convolution sums, with a Green’s func- 
tion  taking  the  place  of  the  unit  impulse  response,  the  Laplace 
transform plays the part of the z -transform, etc. See the disserta- 
tion of Emmert [57] for a summary of relevant results. 

3 

It is also possible to extend an FFR into the complex domain in terms of 
parametrized models of distributed delays [52] , see below, or in terms of state- 
space models [53,54] .

diagram ) with the real part (cid:4) ( F ) and the imaginary part (cid:3) ( F ) as 
abscissa and ordinate, respectively. 

The gain | F (ω) | = n of the n - τ -model is constant, thus with in- 
creasing frequency the phasor traces a circle of radius n while it 
rotates in the counterclockwise direction at a constant rate. 4 Note 
that an animation of a frequency sweep of this ﬁgure is provided 
as supplementary material. 

2.2.2. Dual time delays 

The n - τ -model has been used in numerous studies on funda- 
mental aspects of combustion instability. Nevertheless, one must 
realize that it is a very simplistic model—its characteristic features, 
i.e., a constant gain and a phase lag that increases linearly with 
frequency, do not correspond well with experimental observations 
of ﬂame dynamics. An impulse response model with two non-zero 
coeﬃcients already exhibits non-trivial features, i.e., the gain | F | os- 
cillates between two extremal values, while the slope of the phase 
is no longer constant. Consider the example shown in Fig. 4 with 
non-zero IR coeﬃcients h 2 = 0 . 4 and h 5 = 0 . 6 , where the gain os- 
cillates between max (| F | ) = 1 and min (| F | ) = 0 . 2 . 

The  Nyquist  plot  in  the  center  of  the  ﬁgure  illustrates  how 
this comes about: In addition to the arrow for the frequency re- 
sponse F  (thick  red line), the  plot  also shows  two  arrows  ( blue, 
thin line), which represent the two phasors exp (+ iω(cid:5)tk ) , k = 2 , 5 
corresponding  to  the  two  non-zero  IR  coeﬃcients.  These  arrows 
are placed head to tail because their addition yields the frequency 
response  F ( ω).  At  zero  frequency  (not  shown,  but  again  an  ani- 
mation is provided as supplementary material), the two IR pha- 
sors both point in the purely real direction, i.e., they are aligned 
with each other and yield maximum gain F (0) = h 2 + h 5 = 1 . Ac- 
cording  to  Section  2.1.6 ,  this  would  be  the  quasi-steady  limit  of 
the  frequency  response  of  a  perfectly  premixed  ﬂame.  With  in- 
creasing frequency, the phasor corresponding to h 
5  rotates more 
quickly because it has a larger time delay, and destructive interfer- 
ence with h 
2 reduces the gain of the frequency response, as shown 
in Fig. 4 . Minimum gain results from most destructive interference, 
which coincides with frequencies where the two phasors have a 
relative  phase  difference  of  π ,  such  that  they  point  in  opposite 
directions. For the example conﬁgured here, one can easily show 
that the ﬁrst such frequency equals ωτR = 10 π / 3 , where the gain 
| F | = h 5 − h 2 = 0 . 2 —which is conﬁrmed by inspection of the Bode 
plot in Fig. 4 . Constructive interference between the two IR contri- 
butions with | F | = 1 is then observed at twice that frequency, i.e., 
ωτR = 20 π / 3 . The alternation between destructive and construc- 
tive interference then continues undiminished with frequency (not 
shown). 

The Nyquist plot also helps to show why the slope of the phase 
of the frequency response becomes steeper in the vicinity of min- 
imum gain. Indeed, the reader is invited to verify with the help 
of a Nyquist plot that (nearly) equal strength of the two IR coeﬃ- 
cients ( h 2 , h 5 = 0 . 5 ± δh with small δh → 0) will result in (nearly) 
complete cancellation with | F | → 0 and a jump in phase of the 
frequency response by (nearly) π across the minimum. 

A dual time delay impulse response model with non-zero co- 
eﬃcients  of  opposite  signs  may  exhibit  the  low-frequency  limit 
F (ω → 0) = 1 that one expects for a premixed ﬂame [56] and at 
the  same  time  produce  excess  gain  | F |  >  1  in  a  certain  range

dimensionalized  frequencies  ωτR = 5 π / 2  and  odd  integer  multi- 
ples thereof.

vice versa) and time-domain to frequency-domain (and vice versa). 

In the context of the present study, there is one essential diﬃ- 
culty with continuous-time formulations: systems with delays are 
inﬁnite-order (or inﬁnite-dimensional in state-space). Fortunately, 
in practice Padè approximations have been found to be suﬃciently 
accurate – at least at low to moderate frequencies [58] . 

Fig.  2  provides  an  overview  of  the  transformations  between 
discrete-time  vs.  continuous-time.  Laplace  transform  L  and  z - 
transform  (and  the  respective  inverse  transforms)  allow  to  tran- 
sition from time-domain to frequency-domain (and vice versa). A 
continuous-time  system  is  transformed  to  discrete-time  by  sam- 
pling, zero- or ﬁrst-order hold allow the opposite transformation. 
In the frequency domain the Tustin transform (and its inverse) are 
popular, but like the Padè approximation it does become inaccu- 
rate at high frequencies. 

2.2. Expository examples 

It has been remarked above that the frequency response of a 
ﬂame exhibits characteristic features such as an overall low-pass 
behavior, often with excess gain | F | > 1 in a limited range of fre- 
quencies as well as one (or several) pronounced local minima in 
gain. For the phase, one typically observes an overall decrease that 
is almost linear in frequency, but may exhibit pronounced jumps 
at frequencies where the gain approaches a minimum. This sec- 
tion demonstrates by example that such features of the FFR can 
be  generated  in  a  very  natural  manner  by  distributed  time  delay 
(DTD)  models.  Note  that  for  this  type  of  non-parametric  model 
[10,4 8,4 9] , the impulse response h —which in general is a property 
of a model—is identical with the model, i.e. system response r is 
computed from the signal s via convolution with the impulse re- 
sponse, see Eq.  (7) . 

2.2.1. Single time delay—the n - τ -model 

We  begin  with  the  well-known  n - τ -model  for  unsteady  heat 
release [43,44,59–62] , characterized by an impulse response with 
only one non-zero coeﬃcient of magnitude n ,

Fig. 4.  Discrete-time DTD model with two time delays h 2 = 0 . 4 and h 5 = 0 . 6 . Alternating constructive and destructive superposition results in oscillating gain with local 
maxima and minima, respectively. Note that the phase deviates slightly from linear decay with frequency (cf. Fig. 3 ). 

The Nyquist plot in Fig. 5 again helps to understand what is 
happening  here:  Destructive  superposition  of  the  two  IR  contri- 
butions  of  opposite  sign  yields  a  reduced  gain  at  low  frequen- 
cies. With increasing frequencies, superposition becomes more and 
more constructive until alignment of the two IR phasors is reached, 
which coincides with maximum gain. Note that | F ( ω)| ≥ F (0) for all 
frequencies—which is quite unrealistic because real ﬂames exhibit 
low-pass behavior. This is discussed next. 

2.2.3. Distributed time delays 

The IR models discussed up to this point are quite unrealistic 
inasmuch as their gain does not exhibit an overall low-pass behav- 
ior, which has been observed for such a wide variety of ﬂames that 
it  may  be  considered  a  universal  characteristic  of  ﬂame  dynam- 
ics. Such low-pass behavior is generated by an impulse response 
model with distributed time delay (DTD), as shown in an exem- 
plary manner in Fig. 6 . Again, the phasor plot indicates how this 
comes about: If there are numerous contributions to the frequency 
response from a large number of IR coeﬃcients that cover a range 
of time delays, there will be almost complete cancellation at higher 
frequencies due to the wide range of phases that results from the 
distribution of time delays. In other words, at high frequencies, the 
IR coeﬃcient phasors (the blue arrows in the Nyquist plot) point 
in a seemingly random manner in all directions, such that the fre- 
quency response, which is computed as the vector sum of the IR 
coeﬃcient phasors, is indeed very small. 

Note,  however,  that  a  DTD  model  that  has  only  positive  co- 
k  >  0  will  always  display  maximum  constructive  in- 

eﬃcients  h 

terference  at  zero  frequency,  and  thus  cannot  generate  excess 
gain | F ( ω)| > F (0). On the other hand, an impulse response that 
combines distributed delays with alternating signs—see for exam- 
ple  Fig.  7 —produces  a  frequency  response  that  exhibits  all  the 
non-trivial, characteristic features typically observed in premixed 
(swirling) ﬂames, i.e., overall low-pass behavior with excess gain 
in a limited range of low frequencies followed by a local minimum 
in gain [16,18,20,34,63] . The corresponding Nyquist plot shows that 
the  maximum  in  gain  results  from  constructive  superposition  of 
the IR coeﬃcients, i.e., all phasors point more or less in the same 
direction (dark blue arrows), while the minimum results from de- 
structive superposition (light blue arrows). 

In  closing  this  section,  it  is  acknowledged  that  the  use  of 
Nyquist plots (a.k.a. phasor diagrams ) for the analysis of impulse 
and frequency responses is inspired by Feynman [64] , who devel- 
oped simple, but very insightful explanations of optical phenom- 
ena such as reﬂection, refraction and iridescence, as well as a va- 
riety  of  quantum-mechanical  effects,  by  “adding  arrows”,  i.e.  by 
“hooking the head of one to the tail of the next”. 

2.3. Physical background and limitations of distributed time delay 
models 

The  previous  section  showed  by  way  of  example  that  dis- 
tributed  time  delay  (DTD)  models  can  generate  in  a  straightfor- 
ward manner characteristic, non-trivial features of the frequency 
response of premixed ﬂames. For the gain, such features include an 
overall low-pass behavior, possibly with excess gain or local min-

ima. For the phase of the frequency response, one often observes 
a decrease that is almost linear in frequency, possibly interrupted 
by phase jumps that occur at frequencies where the gain exhibits 
a local minimum [12,63,65,66] . 

This  section  ﬁrst  argues  that  DTD  models  capture  important 
ﬂow physics of ﬂame dynamics quite intuitively. Then it addresses 
the  question  to  which  extent  and  subject  to  which  limitations 
DTD  models  can  provide  a  general  and  complete  description  of 
ﬂame dynamics. The section closes with comments on frequency- 
dependent time delays, which have been proposed as an alterna- 
tive to DTD models. 

2.3.1. Convective transport of perturbations 

Time delays are crucial for thermo-acoustic combustion insta- 
bility. For example, Crocco [44] argued when introducing the n - τ - 
model that self-excited combustion instability can develop only if 
“the  burning  does  not  immediately  follow  the  injection” of  pro- 
pellants, i.e., if there is a certain time lag τ between injection and 
heat release. For the case considered, this argument constitutes an 
alternative formulation of Rayleigh’s famous stability criterion [67] . 
This section describes mechanisms of acoustics/ﬂow/ﬂame interac- 
tion that in general delay the response of a ﬂame to acoustic per- 
turbations. 

10 

W. Polifke / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 79 (2020) 100845 

In  the  paper  that  originally  introduced  the  sensitive  time  lag 
model, Crocco [44] considered burning of mono-propellant fuel in 
a rocket engine; the pertinent time lags are the time intervals re- 
quired  for  heating,  vaporization  and  chemical  transformation  of 
fuel droplets. For gaseous fuels, the ﬁrst two effects obviously can- 
not play a role, instead the time required for convective transport 
of fuel from the injector to the reaction zone of the ﬂame and for 
mixing of fuel and oxidizer takes their place [29–31] . The acoustic 
inertia of the premix injector nozzle (the “burner”) may also intro- 
duce phase lags between acoustic pressure perturbations and ﬂow 
response [32,68,69] . For premixed ﬂames, another crucial time de- 
lay is related to the convective transport of perturbations of the 
ﬂame  shape  (“ﬂame  wrinkles”)  from  the  point  of  ﬂame  anchor- 
ing to the ﬂame tip [25,26] . In addition, convective velocity distur- 
bances, which may result from acoustic-vortical mode conversion, 
or from feedback of the perturbed ﬂame and the upstream ﬂow 
ﬁeld, result in a delayed-distributed response [12,70–72] . For swirl 
ﬂames, the propagation of an inertial wave (a.k.a. vortical wave or 
swirl wave ) from the swirl generator to the ﬂame and the response 
of the ﬂame to the resulting perturbations of velocity at the ﬂame 
front constitute important additional acoustics/ﬂow/ﬂame interac- 
tion mechanisms [16,18,30,34,38,63,73–76] . 

These  thermoacoustic  interaction  mechanisms  and  the  corre- 
sponding distributed time delays in ﬂame response will be expli- 
cated  in  the  subsequent  sections.  Here  we  point  out  a  common 
feature: the distributed delays result predominantly from convec- 
tive transport of perturbations by the mean ﬂow. If the ﬂame dy- 
namics is described in terms of the impulse response h , the co- 
eﬃcients h 
k may be identiﬁed directly as the corresponding time 
delays. 

2.3.2. Limitations on the validity and range of applicability of DTD 
models 

It has been shown that DTD models can reproduce features of- 
ten seen in the frequency response of premixed ﬂames, and the 
preceding  section  has  argued  that  this  type  of  model  intuitively 
captures the physics of ﬂame dynamics from the viewpoint of con- 
vectively transported disturbances. Nevertheless, the question re- 
mains whether DTD models can provide a complete and generally 
valid description of ﬂame dynamics. 

It is textbook knowledge [10,45–49] that a linear, time-invariant 
(LTI) system is completely characterized by its impulse response. 
In  practice,  it  is  important  that  the  impulse  response  has  a  ﬁ- 
nite number of (signiﬁcant) coeﬃcients, such that the system may 
be modeled as an FIR. As mentioned above, this necessitates that 
the system be BIBO stable—a condition which might be violated, 
e.g.,  by  ﬂames  that  develop  absolute  (hydrodynamic  or  thermo- 
diffusive) instabilities in response to a small initial perturbation. 
This  scenario  is  not  considered  here,  as  it  is  not  directly  rele- 
vant for genuinely thermo-acoustic instabilities that rely on two- 
way coupling between ﬂuctuations of acoustics and heat release 
rate [77] . 

The important question is thus under which conditions a ﬂame 
may be regarded as a linear, time-invariant system. Indeed, linear- 
ity of system dynamics is recognized as a crucial assumption that 
is implied by the impulse response framework, see Eq.  (4) . Flames 
are known to respond in a nonlinear manner to large amplitude 
perturbations. It follows that the impulse response (as well as the 
step response or the frequency response) can provide a compre- 
hensive description of ﬂame dynamics only in the limit of small 
amplitudes. How small is “small” in this context? The response of 
premixed ﬂames to velocity perturbations typically shows charac- 
teristic nonlinear behavior such as non-sinusoidal ﬂuctuations of 
heat  release  rate  or  saturation  of  oscillation  amplitude  once  the 
excitation  amplitude  reaches  20–50%  of  the  mean  ﬂow  velocity 
[22,66,78,79] . There are notable exceptions: For the response of a 

laminar premixed ﬂame to modulation of equivalence ratio, Hem- 
chandra’s results suggest that nonlinear effects are already notice- 
able at 4% relative perturbation amplitude [80] . If heat release is 
dominated by autoignition, the limit of the linear regime may be 
at even lower perturbation levels: Zellhuber et al. report a value 
of 2% [81] . A recent, much more detailed analysis of reheat ﬂame 
dynamics  by  Gant  et  al.  [82]  conﬁrms  this  high  sensitivity.  It  is 
quite interesting that this strongly nonlinear behavior is related to 
a variation of the auto-ignition time lag in response to modulation 
of equivalence ratio, reminiscent of the “sensitive time lag” con- 
cept of Crocco [59] . Zellhuber et al. [81] discuss another “patholog- 
ical” case, i.e., a symmetrical, acoustically compact ﬂame exposed 
to transversal forcing. Fundamental symmetry arguments suggest 
that such a ﬂame exhibits a nonlinear response even in the limit 
of inﬁnitesimal perturbation amplitude: Due to symmetry, a pos- 
itive forcing signal with tangential velocity from left to right, say, 
produces the same result as a forcing of equal strength, but oppo- 
site direction. The sum of the two signals is zero, but the sum of 
the responses is not zero—which clearly violates the criterion for 
linearity Eq.  (4) in an essential manner, i.e., even at inﬁnitesimal 
forcing amplitudes [83] . 

Clearly,  one  must  keep  in  mind  that  nonlinear  behavior  can 
jeopardize the accurate experimental or numerical determination 
of impulse and frequency responses, and at the same time limit 
the range of applications of these models. On the other hand, non- 
linear extensions such as the ﬂame describing function or higher 
order  transfer  functions  have  been  proposed  and  have  already 
proven their usefulness [78,84–90] . Some of these developments 
will be discussed in Section 4.3 . 

On  the  other  hand,  the  second  condition  on  LTI  systems,  i.e. 
time-invariance, has not been debated in the literature on ﬂame 
dynamics. If steady-state boundary conditions are imposed for the 
mean ﬂow, it is generally accepted that the evolution of small am- 
plitude perturbations is governed by time-invariant equations. 

The reader should appreciate that even in cases where the dy- 
namics of an LTI system—the response of a ﬂame to a small pertur- 
bation, say—is not governed by time delays, the impulse response 
remains a valid and complete characterization of the system dy- 
namics (see Section 2.1 ). However, in such situations it may be dif- 
ﬁcult to develop a physics-based interpretation of the impulse re- 
sponse, and the impulse response may be an ineﬃcient model with 
an unnecessarily large—even inﬁnite—number of coeﬃcients. 

For example, ﬁrst-order systems have been used to describe the 
response of a well-stirred reactor to inﬂow perturbations [91,92] . 
The  corresponding  transfer  function  F (s ) = 1 + (cid:15)(1 + τ s ) ,  with 
the Laplace variable s ≡ i ω, is characterized by only two parame- 
ters, i.e., the gain (cid:15) and the time constant τ (which should not be 
mistaken for a time delay). The corresponding impulse response 
k = (cid:15)[1 − exp (1 − k (cid:5)t/τ )] , k = 
has  inﬁnitely  many  coeﬃcients  h 
1 , . . . , ∞ . Obviously, computing the system output as a convolution 
of past inputs with the impulse response is computationally ex- 
pensive. Instead, the system dynamics should be computed in dif- 
ference form as a weighted sum of present input and previous out- 
put [10] . In such situations, the impulse response should be seen 
as a property of a system model, which is preferably described in 
difference form (in the time domain) or as a transfer function (in 
the frequency domain). On the other hand, if the system physics 
indeed is adequately described in terms of distributed time delays, 
then the impulse response may be regarded as the canonical form 
of a system model, as argued above. It shall be shown subsequently 
that this scenario indeed typically applies to ﬂame dynamics. 

2.3.3. Frequency-dependent time delays 

The phase arg (F ) = −ωτ of the transfer function of the n - τ - 
model  with  its  single  time  delay  τ decreases  linearly  with  fre- 
quency,  see  Fig.  3 .  However,  the  phase  of  the  FTF  of  premixed 

W. Polifke / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 79 (2020) 100845 

11 

ﬂames often deviates from a strictly linear decay. Fortunately, dis- 
tributed time delays can reproduce deviations of phase decay from 
linear  behavior  as  they  are  typically  observed  in  ﬂame  dynam- 
ics  quite  nicely,  as  illustrated  in  Figs.  4–7 .  Alternatively,  it  has 
been suggested that such non-trivial behavior of the phase of the 
FTF may be described in terms of a frequency-dependent time de- 
lay  τ (ω) = arg (F ) /ω.  However,  in  the  case  of  ﬂame  dynamics, 
time  delays  may  often  be  associated  with  the  convective  trans- 
port of perturbations by the mean ﬂow. In the limit of small per- 
turbation amplitudes (“linear” regime), such convective time scales 
should not vary with the frequency of perturbations, and the no- 
tion of a frequency-dependent time lag appears to be physically 
ill-conceived. 

Also consider that according to Eq.  (14) the impulse response 
of a transfer function with constant gain and linearly decreasing 
phase F (ω) = n exp (−iωl(cid:5)t) is computed as 

k = 
h 

n (cid:5)t 
2 π

(cid:4) + π / (cid:5)t 

−π / (cid:5)t 

e iω(cid:5)t (k −l) 

dω = nδ

kl , 

i.e. a “pure delay” with only one non-zero coeﬃcient of the im- 
pulse response. This result makes perfect sense, because the trans- 
fer function considered is that of an n - τ -model with interaction in- 
dex n and time lag τ = l(cid:5)t. Conversely, if the phase of an FTF does 
not exhibit a strictly linear decrease with frequency—which nomi- 
nally could be described as a frequency dependent time lag τ ( ω)—
or if its gain changes with frequency, n = n (ω) , the above equation 
would yield in general an impulse response with more than one 
non-zero coeﬃcient, i.e. a distribution of (frequency-independent) 
time delays. The representation in terms of DTDs allows to iden- 
tify the respective time scales and the relative strenghts of the rel- 
evant ﬂow-ﬂame interaction mechanisms (examples will be pre- 
sented in the following). Conversely, a frequency-dependent time 
delay determined as arg (F (ω )) /ω  assigns a single nominal time 
scale to all interaction mechanisms, and might be off by multiple 
of 2 π / ω. A further complication arises in the context of thermo- 
acoustic stability analysis, where the FTF has to be evaluated for 
complex-valued frequencies ω ∈ C . Thanks to the z -transform, this 
is not a problem at all if the ﬂame dynamics is described in terms 
of a DTD, see Section 2.1.4 . On the other hand, it is not obvious at 
all how an FTF formulated in terms of a frequency-dependent time 
lag τ ( ω) would be extended into the complex domain. 

It  is  thus  the  present  author’s  opinion  that  a  frequency- 
dependent time delay τ ( ω) is a notion that obscures the actual dy- 
namics and the time scales of ﬂow-ﬂame interaction mechanisms 
and should in general be avoided. 

3. Analytical models for laminar premixed ﬂames 

This section will review analytical models for the time-delayed 
response  of  premixed  ﬂames  to  perturbations  of  the  upstream 
ﬂow  velocity  or  to  modulations  of  the  equivalence  ratio  of  the 
fuel/air premixture. Like earlier studies [11,12,25–28] , which ana- 
lyzed the ﬂame response in the frequency domain and predicted 
the ﬂame transfer function, the models are based on the so-called 
G-equation and are limited to the simplest possible case, i.e., lam- 
inar ﬂames with a ﬂame speed S L that does not depend on ﬂame 
curvature.  The  effect  of  heat  release  on  the  ﬂuid  density  is  not 
taken into account explicitly. 

Despite these limitations, the analysis of ﬂame dynamics in the 
time domain made it possible to identify relevant time scales of 
ﬂow/ﬂame  interaction  unambiguously,  and  to  reveal  the  relation 
of  these  time  scales  to  prominent  features  of  the  frequency  re- 
sponse. Also note that it was possible to establish complete agree- 
ment with earlier results for the FTF, which were determined by 
analysis in the frequency domain.

The

so-called  G -equation  has  been 

introduced  by 
Williams  [94]  in  the  study  of  premixed  turbulent  combustion. 
It is based on a ﬂamelet modeling assumption and uses a level-set 
method to describe the evolution of the ﬂame front as an inter- 
face  of  inﬁnitesimal  thickness  between  premixture  and  burned 
gases [95] . Consider now an anchored, premixed ﬂame in ﬂame- 
aligned ( X, Y ) as well as laboratory-ﬁxed ( x, y ) coordinate systems, 
as shown in Fig. 8 . Starting from the G -equation, one can derive 
[25,26] a linearized equation for the ﬂame displacement ξ :

with  U (cid:5) = u (cid:5) sin α and  V = ¯u cos α.  Eq.

dimensionalized  with  ﬂame  length  ˜ L 
velocity  ˜ V = ˜ ¯u cos α along  the  ﬂame  front  (a  tilde  ˜ . . .  denotes 
a  dimensional  quantity).  The  corresponding  time  scale  ˜ τr = 
˜ R / ( ˜ ¯u sin α cos α)  is  identiﬁed  as  the  time  of  restoration  (see  be- 
low),  equal  to  the  time  interval  during  which  a  perturbation  in 
ﬂame shape travels from the ﬂame base to the ﬂame tip. This time 
scale is a rather intuitive choice, which has been used previously 
[11,12,25,26] ,  but  can  also  be  rigorously  derived  by  a  kinematic 
argument [93] . With this choice of non-dimensionalized variables 
V = 1 by deﬁnition and may thus be omitted.

Blumenthal et al. [93,96] deduced analytically the impulse re- 
sponses  of  “conical” as  well  as  “wedge” ﬂames  (also  called  “V- 
ﬂames”) to velocity perturbations from the model Eq. (21) under 
the assumption that the ﬂame speed S L is constant and thus S (cid:5) 
L = 0 . 
In this case the ﬂuctuating rate of heat release  ˙ q (cid:5)  is determined 
from the ﬂuctuation in ﬂame surface area A (cid:5) :

3.2. Uniform velocity model 

Blumenthal  et  al.  [93]  ﬁrst  consider  the  response  of  a  coni- 
cal  ﬂame  to  a  spatially  uniform  impulse  velocity  perturbation  of

Fig. 9.  Snapshot of a conical premixed ﬂame surface after perturbation with a velocity impulse in the uniform (left) and the convective (right) velocity model (ﬂow is 
directed from bottom to top). In both cases, the restoration of the original ﬂame shape, which starts from the anchoring point right after the perturbation is imposed, brings 
about an overlap of ﬂame sheets, the resulting increase in ﬂame surface area increases in a corresponding manner the heat release rate. The convective perturbation (left) 
creates a gap in the ﬂame sheet, with a corresponding decrease in ﬂame heat release. The gap as well as the overlap propagate along the ﬂame and vanish once they reach 
the ﬂame tip at times ˜ t = ˜ τc and ˜ t = ˜ τr , respectively. Reproduced from [93] . 

strength  ˜ (cid:7) in  the  direction  of  mean  ﬂow,  ˜ u (cid:5) (t) = ˜ (cid:7) ˜ δ(t ) ,  ˜ v (cid:5) (t ) = 
0 ,  which  displaces  at  time t = 0  the  entire  ﬂame  by  a  distance 
(cid:6) ∞ 
0  ˜ u (cid:5) (t) dt = ˜ (cid:7) in the downstream direction. 

At times t > 0 right after the impulse perturbation is imposed, 
a “new” ﬂame sheet develops from the point of ﬂame attachment. 
The “old” ﬂame sheet downstream of the original ﬂame position is 
gradually deprived of fresh premixture by this “new” ﬂame sheet 
and thus extinguishes, such that eventually the original ﬂame is re- 
established. This process of ﬂame restoration manifests itself for ˜ t < 
˜ τr  (or t < 1) as a discontinuous change in ﬂame displacement ξ , 
which propagates along the ﬂame with velocity V = 1 , such that it 
is found at position Y 1 = t, see Fig. 9 (left). Seen from the direction 
of mean ﬂow x , the discontinuity between “old” and restored ﬂame 
results in an overlap (cid:5), which increases the overall ﬂame surface 
area and thus the heat release rate. 

Note  that  restoration  as  discussed  here  differs  from  kinematic 
restoration , which has been identiﬁed as a key mechanism of non- 
linearity in premixed ﬂame dynamics that results in saturation of 
ﬂame response [97] . Kinematic restoration refers to the smooth- 
ing of wrinkles in the ﬂame surface and ﬂame surface annihilation 
due to ﬂame propagation. This phenomenon can be inferred from 
the so-called Hopf-Lax formula, which provides a general solution 
for ﬂame propagation in a quiescent medium that is not affected 
by the ﬂame, see e.g. [37] , section 11.2.3. On the other hand, in 
the  present  context  restoration  denotes  the  re-establishmennt  of 
the original shape of an anchored ﬂame subsequent to an initial 
perturbation of the ﬂow ﬁeld. Despite these differences, the basic 
physical process, i.e. Huygens propagation of the ﬂame front nor- 
mal to itself, is identical in both kinds of restoration. 

Blumenthal  et  al.  [93]  show  that  the  perturbed  ﬂame  shape 
with the overlap at Y 1 = t may be expressed in terms of Heaviside 
step functions H(t)

Combined with Eq.  (23) , the following result for the impulse 
response of a conical ﬂame (subscript “C”) with the uniform veloc- 
ity model (subscript “U”) is obtained:

decays linearly between the values S(0) = 1 and S(1) = 0 , while 
it is zero outside the interval 0 ≤ t ≤ 1 (cf. Fig. 10 ). 

The strength of this impulse response decreases linearly over 
time (see Fig. 10 , left) because a conical ﬂame narrows toward the 
tip. Consequently, the increase in ﬂame heat release rate that re- 
sults from the overlap between original and restored ﬂame sheet 
decreases linearly with Y —this is accounted for by the weighting 
factor K(Y ) = 1 − Y —as the overlap travels along the ﬂame, which 
implies  a  corresponding  linear  decrease  with  time  t .  A  wedge 
ﬂame (also called “V-ﬂame”) widens from the point of ﬂame an- 
choring, consequently, its impulse response with the uniform ve- 
locity model increases over time (see Fig. 10 , right) and reads

The  time-domain  analysis  of  Blumenthal  et  al.  [93,96]  shows 
how  uniform,  instantaneous  displacement  of  an  anchored  pre- 
mixed ﬂame results in a delayed ﬂame response, distributed over 
the  time  of  restoration τ r .  This  interplay  between  sudden  ﬂame 
displacement followed by gradual restoration of the ﬂame shape 
from the anchoring point was discussed also by Preetham et al. 
[65] ,  who  argue  with  reference  to  [26] :  “if  a  ﬂame  anchoring 
boundary  condition  is  imposed...the  ﬂow  disturbance  excites  a 
ﬂame-front disturbance that originates at the base and propagates 
along the ﬂame front....” The results of Blumenthal et al. [93] cor- 
roborate the interpretation of the “homogeneous solution” of the 
equation for ﬂame surface position offered by Preetham et al. [65] , 
but the time-domain analysis in terms of the impulse response is 
more intuitive and makes it easier to grasp the essential physics 
of  the  ﬂow-ﬂame  interaction.  Also  note  that  one-sided  Fourier 
transform  of  the  impulse  responses  (25)  and  (27)  yields  the  re-

spective FTF, in complete agreement with the results of Ducruix 
et al. [11] and Schuller et al., see Eqs. (22) and (31) in [12] . 

3.3. Convective velocity model 

Flame  transfer  functions  predicted  with  the  uniform  velocity 
model exhibit a number of unrealistic features, such as saturation 
in phase, or absence of excess gain | F | > 1 [12,26,65] . Moreover, 
Baillot et al. [70] observed convective waves in the approach ﬂow 
upstream of pulsating laminar ﬂames and reported that a convec- 
tive velocity model can reproduce important features of perturbed 
ﬂame shapes with increased accuracy. 

Schuller et al. [12] determined analytically the FTF of conical 
and  wedge  ﬂames  (“V-ﬂames”)  and  observed  that  a  model  that 
includes  convective  perturbations  upstream  of  the  ﬂame  yields 
improved  agreement  of  predicted  gain  and  phase  with  numeri- 
cal  simulations  and  experiments.  In  particular,  the  correct  high- 
frequency trend for the transfer function phase is recovered, the 
transfer function gain exhibits a cut-off frequency once the convec- 
tive wavelength along the ﬂame front equals the ﬂame length, and 
the wedge ﬂame can exhibit excess gain in a certain range of fre- 
quencies. Moreover, it was shown that with the convective veloc- 
ity model the ﬂame dynamics is governed by two non-dimensional 
parameters, i.e., a reduced frequency and the ﬂame angle. 

Previous  studies  formulated  a  convective  velocity  model  for 
the case of harmonic forcing [12,70] . With a ﬂame-aligned coor- 
dinate system ( X, Y ) and non-dimensionalized variables as intro- 
duced  above  (see  Fig.  8 ),  Blumenthal  et  al.  [93]  describe  a  con- 
vective impulse perturbation that travels along the ﬂame sheet at 
phase velocity W ≡ w /cos α as follows: 
(cid:9)
(cid:10)
(cid:5) (Y, t) = δ

U 

In response to such a perturbation, the ﬂame front is not dis- 
placed as a whole, but only locally at the ﬂame position Y 2 = W t, 
see Fig. 9 (right), resulting in a discontinuity in ξ . Seen from the 
direction of mean ﬂow x , this discontinuity corresponds to a gap of 
the ﬂame surface, with a corresponding decrease in overall ﬂame 
heat release rate. While the gap resulting from the local displace- 
ment propagates along the ﬂame with velocity W toward the tip, 
ﬂame restoration proceeds from the anchoring point, as it did in 
the case of uniform ﬂame displacement. Clearly, ﬂame dynamics is 
now governed by two time scales, i.e., the time of restoration  ˜ τr as 
introduced above and a characteristic time of convection  ˜ τc , which 
satisfy the following relations between time and velocity scales:

Fig. 11.  Impulse responses of conical ﬂames (left) and wedge ﬂames (right) com- 
puted with the convective velocity model for w = ¯u and ﬂame angles α equal to 
65 ◦ (—), 45 ◦ ( . . . ) and 25 ◦ ( − − −). The peaks in the IR of the conical ﬂame, as well 
as the changes in sign in the IR of the wedge ﬂame, occur at t = τc , corresponding 
to t = cos 2 α. 

The  ﬁrst  slope  function  (with  argument  t )  represents  the 
restorative contribution to the ﬂame response. The second slope 
function (with argument t / τ c ) accounts for the convective contri- 
bution. This contribution is negative, because the gap in ﬂame sur- 
face  area  implies  a  reduction  in  heat  release  rate.  Compared  to 
the results of the uniform velocity model, both contributions are 
scaled by a prefactor 1 / (1 − τC ) . Thanks to this prefactor, the in- 
tegral over the impulse responses is unity in spite of the partial 
cancellation between the restorative and convective contributions. 
In this way, the correct low-frequency limit | F (ω → 0) | = 1 of the 
ﬂame transfer function is recovered, see Section 2.1.6 and [56] . Be- 
cause the restoration process cannot precede the convective per- 
turbation, one must assume that W > 1, thus τ c < 1, i.e., the con- 
vective contribution to the impulse response is shorter-lived than 
the restorative contribution. In the limit of very high convection 
speeds W → ∞ , the convective time scale τ c becomes very small 
and the results of the uniform velocity model are recovered. 

As remarked by Schuller et al. [12] the ﬂame angle α now has 
an inﬂuence on the ﬂame response because the convective time 
scale τ c  depends on α (this was not the case with the uniform 
velocity  perturbation).  Impulse  responses  for  conical  as  well  as 
wedge ﬂames for α = 65 ◦, 45 ◦, 25 ◦ are shown in Fig. 11 , where 
it has been assumed without loss of generality that the convec- 
tive perturbation travels with the mean ﬂow velocity w = ¯u , and 
thus τc = cos 2 α (see Table 1 in [93] ). Both the gap and the over- 
lap in ﬂame surface area are present on the ﬂame front for early 
times  t  ≤ τ c ,  i.e.  both  response  mechanisms  act  in  parallel.  For 
later  times τ c  ≤ t  ≤ 1,  only  restoration  is  active.  The  analytical 
results of Schuller et al. for the corresponding FTFs are again re- 
covered exactly as the one-sided Fourier transform of the impulse 
responses (see Eqs. (24) and (33) in [12] ). Note that all coeﬃcients 
k of the impulse response of the conical ﬂame are positive, while 
h 
the wedge ﬂame has coeﬃcients h 
k of alternating sign. Figs. 5 and 
7 imply that the wedge ﬂame may have excess gain, while for the 
conical ﬂame | F ( ω)| ≤ | F (0)| for all ω > 0. This conclusion is fully 
conﬁrmed by the results of Schuller et al. [12] . 

3.4. Incompressible convective velocity model 

The convective velocity model as originally introduced by Bail- 
lot et al. [70] included a velocity component v (cid:5)  perpendicular to 
the  mean  ﬂow  ¯u ,  which  ensured  that  the  perturbation  velocity 
ﬁeld was divergence free. Cuquel et al. [98,99] obtained analytical 
expressions for the frequency and the impulse responses of coni- 
cal ﬂames with this type of incompressible convective velocity model . 
Results are found to agree with the analysis of Preetham et al. [65] , 
which is formulated in the frequency domain. 

Comparison with experimental data obtained for different noz- 
zle  geometries  and  ﬂow  operating conditions  over  a  wide  range 
of  parameters  showed  a  very  good  match  of  the  phase  of  the 
frequency  response.  Unfortunately,  the  incompressible convective 
model  over-predicts  the  gain  of  open  ﬂames,  but  discrepancies 
with experiment reduce when ﬂame conﬁnement is introduced.

Fig. 13.  Impulse and frequency responses of wedge ﬂames computed with the con- 
vective velocity model for the case w = ¯u (left). The left graph shows the impulse 
response of a narrow wedge ﬂame ( α = 22 ◦) as a shaded area, overlaid with har- 
monic forcing signals multiplied with the impulse response. Forcing frequencies 
correspond to maximum gain (  ) and the cutoff ( 
) of the ﬂame response. 
The right graph shows the gain of the frequency response with ﬂame angle α vary- 
ing from α = 15 ◦ ( − · −), α = 30 ◦ ( 
), α = 45 ◦ (—), α = 60 ◦ (  ) to α = 75 ◦
( − − −). Adapted from [93] . 

The wedge ﬂame with the convective velocity model exhibits 
an impulse response with positive as well as negative coeﬃcients, 
i.e., the heat release rate is reduced ( h CW ( t ) < 0) for times t < τ c , 
and enhanced ( h CW ( t ) > 0) for times t > τ c . It follows that this 
model may generate excess gain with | F CW | > 1 for certain frequen- 
cies. Moreover, the difference in magnitude between negative and 
positive  coeﬃcients  increases  with  decreasing  ﬂame  angle,  thus 
excess gain should be more pronounced for narrow ﬂames with 
small ﬂame angle α. Indeed, Fig. 13 (right) shows this behavior, 
as predicted already by Schuller et al. [12] , who commented that 
the wedge/convective model “has a preferred range of frequencies 
where it acts as an ampliﬁer”. Durox et al. [102] conﬁrmed this in 
experiment, while Preetham et al. [65] explain the excess in gain 
as an effect of constructive interference between spatially uniform 
and non-uniform disturbances. This is in line with the arguments 
developed by Blumenthal et al. [93] , if one identiﬁes the “spatially 
uniform disturbance” with the restoration process, and the “non- 
uniform disturbance” with the convective perturbation. 

Inspection of the ﬂame impulse response in the time domain 
not only allows one to assess whether excess gain may occur, it 
also facilitates a rough estimate of the frequencies at which gain 
attains a maximum. Consider the left graph in Fig. 13 , which shows 
the impulse response of a narrow wedge ﬂame and two harmonic 
forcing signals, each of them multiplied with the impulse response. 
If a forcing frequency is selected such that half a period of oscilla- 
tions equals the difference between restorative and convective time 
scales,  T / 2 = τr − τc  (see  the  continuous,  magenta-colored  line 
), the contributions to the ﬂuctuations of heat release  ˙ q (cid:5) (t) from 
times t − t (cid:5) with τ c < t (cid:5) < τ r interfere constructively and with sig- 
niﬁcant amplitude, because the impulse response coeﬃcients are 
large and positive in the interval [ τ c , τ r ] and the forcing signal is 
also positive throughout this interval. The contributions from ear- 
lier times to the heat release rate should be comparatively unim- 
portant because the amplitudes are low and there is destructive 
interference due to the alternating sign of the forcing signal. It fol- 
lows that the ﬂame will act as a strong ampliﬁer near frequencies 

ω max = 

π
τr − τc 

= 

π
1 − cos 2 α

sin 2 α

. 

(34) 

Fig. 13 (right) roughly conﬁrms this simple estimate. Conversely, 
if the forcing frequency is twice as large, the sign of the forcing 
signal alternates in the interval [ τ c , τ r ] (see the dashed, blue line 
) and one expects a minimum in gain of the ﬂame response—

which is indeed observed in Fig. 13 (right). The argument can be 
extended to predict local maxima and minima in gain | F | with good 
quantitative accuracy at frequencies above the cutoff frequency of 
ﬂame response, see Fig. 10 a in [93] . 

A conical ﬂame exposed to an incompressible convective per- 
turbation also exhibits an impulse response with positive as well 
as negative coeﬃcients. In this case, heat release is enhanced at

vective model for ﬂame angles α equal to 15 ◦, 30 ◦ 45 ◦ and 60 ◦, respectively. Repro- 
duced from [98] . 

Using non-dimensional variables and the slope function as in- 
troduced above, the impulse response of a conical ﬂame that re- 
sults from the incompressible convective velocity model may be 
written as follows (cf. [98] , Eq. (4.24)): 

h ICC = 

(cid:15) 
(cid:7)
τc 

1 
1 − τc 

(cid:8)

+ S(t) + 

(cid:7)
1 
1 − τc 

S(t) − S(t/τc ) 

(cid:8)(cid:16) 
. 

(32) 

It is worth noting that large negative values of the impulse re- 
sponse at late times t → 1 are found for narrow ﬂames, see Fig. 12 . 
Indeed, 

h ICC (1) = −

τc 
1 − τc 

= − 1 
tan 2 α

. 

(33) 

These negative values are a consequence of the constraint that the 
impulse response time-integral be equal to unity, as explained in 
Section 2.2 . 

3.5. Discussion of results 

Presentation of impulse or frequency response in terms of non- 
dimensional groups facilitates the identiﬁcation of universal char- 
acteristics of ﬂame dynamics. Blumenthal et al. [93] point out that 
analysis of the response to impulse perturbations in the time do- 
main  makes  it  easy  to  identify  relevant  time  scales  by  inspec- 
tion, such as the restorative time scale  ˜ τr , which governs restora- 
tion  of  an  anchored  ﬂame  after  perturbation,  or  the  convective 
time scale  ˜ τc associated with the propagation of a convective per- 
turbation  along  the  length  of  the  ﬂame.  Corresponding  to  these 
time  scales,  there  are  respective  non-dimensional  groups,  which 
are identiﬁed as a non-dimensional frequency for the restorative 
2 , ω ∗ in [65] and [12] , 
process (Strouhal number St in [65,100] or St 
respectively), and a variant of the ﬂame angle for the convective 
process (cos 2 α in [12] or cot 2 α in [65] ). Ranalli et al. [101] offer 
an interesting discussion of the adequate choice of length and time 
scales. 

All  ﬂame  models  discussed  in  the  previous  sub-sections—i.e., 
conical and wedge ﬂames with uniform or (incompressible) con- 
vective velocity perturbations, respectively—exhibit responses to a 
velocity impulse that are distributed smoothly over a wide time 
interval  0  ≤ t  ≤ τ r .  Considering  the  arguments  presented  in 
Section 2.2 , one should expect overall low-pass behavior of the cor- 
responding ﬂame frequency responses. Indeed, this behavior was 
observed in experiment or simulation on many occasions, see e.g. 
[11,12,65] .

15 

early times t < τ c , and reduced at late times. It follows that this 
model may also generate excess gain. However, results of Cuquel 
et  al.  [98,99]  indicate  that  the  effect  is  not  pronounced  for  this 
ﬂame, even if the ﬂame angle α is quite small. 

Steinbacher et al. [72] scrutinized the origin and nature of con- 
vective perturbations in ﬂow-ﬂame-acoustic interactions. The study 
is  based  on  the  hypothesis  that  vorticity  shed  at  the  ﬂame  an- 
choring point accounts for the convective nature of ﬂow perturba- 
tions. The velocity ﬁeld induced by an acoustic perturbation is de- 
composed into irrotational-potential and vortical parts, which are 
solved via respective Schwarz-Christoffel mappings. The respective 
effects of each contribution on the ﬂame impulse and frequency 
responses are computed for a slit Bunsen ﬂame from a linearized 
G-equation model as described above. Contrary to expectations, it 
was  found  that  the  potential  velocity  ﬁeld  dominates  the  ﬂame 
response, whereas the vortex shed at the point of ﬂame anchor- 
ing has only a negligible impact. Given that the potential part of 
ﬂow perturbation displaces predominantly the ﬂame base, a ﬂame- 
base-displacement  (FBD) model is proposed. Its impulse response 
is found to compare well with CFD data right after an acoustic ve- 
locity perturbation is imposed, but increasing discrepancies are ob- 
served at later times. These discrepancies are attributed to exother- 
mic  effects,  which  generate  convective  velocity  perturbations  in 
the ﬂow just upstream of the ﬂame front via the Darrieus-Landau 
mechanism, which causes growth of advected ﬂame front pertur- 
bations  [70,71,103,104] . Since these perturbations are a result—or 
an “output”—of ﬂame-ﬂow interactions, it is concluded that models 
that impose a convective perturbation as an input strictly speaking 
misrepresent the causality of acoustics-ﬂow-ﬂame interactions. The 
time-domain representation of ﬂame dynamics in terms of the im- 
pulse response played a crucial role in the analysis of Steinbacher 
et al. [72] because correlation does not imply causation , thus it is 
diﬃcult to unravel the causality of interactions in the frequency 
domain. 

In a follow-up study, Steinbacher et al. [105] critically reviewed 
analytical ﬂame response modeling concepts and scrutinized the 
implications  of  premixed  ﬂame  geometry  on  the  respective  dy- 
namics. In particular, analytical models based on the G-equation 
for slit, Bunsen and wedge type ﬂames were considered. The char- 
acteristics  of  the  respective  frequency  responses  were  analyzed, 
conclusions  were  validated  against  high-ﬁdelity  numerical  simu- 
lations. Important qualitative differences between the three ﬂame 
types were elucidated and it was found that integration over the 
ﬂame surface, which is required to compute the heat release rate 
from the instantaneous ﬂame shape, constitutes the most signiﬁ- 
cant geometry-related property affecting the FFR: The heat release 
rate of stiﬄy anchored slit ﬂames reacts only to movements of the 
ﬂame tip and, hence, those ﬂames respond to perturbations with 
a pronounced time lag. On the other hand, Bunsen ﬂames contin- 
uously transform ﬂame front deﬂections to changes in the heat re- 
lease rate and thus show a more pronounced low-pass behavior 
than  slit  ﬂames.  Finally,  wedge  ﬂames  react  to  both  movements 
of the ﬂame tip and the integral of instantaneous ﬂame front de- 
ﬂections. Again the time-domain formulation of ﬂame dynamics in 
terms of the impulse response of heat release plays an important 
role in this analysis. 

3.6. Response to modulations of equivalence ratio 

In  a  seminal  paper  Lieuwen  and  Zinn  [31]  analyzed  the  re- 
sponse of premixed ﬂames to perturbations of equivalence ratio φ(cid:5) . 
They pointed out that even if a ﬂame is acoustically compact, i.e. if 
its length L is much smaller than the acoustic wave length λ = c/ f, 
such that the corresponding Helmholtz number 
He ≡ f L 
c 

(35) 

Fig. 14.  Perturbations of equivalence ratio modulate the heat of reaction and the 
laminar ﬂame speed. The latter effect perturbs ﬂame shape and ﬂame surface area. 
All three effects combined govern the response in heat release rate to equivalence 
ratio perturbations [15,33] . Reproduced from [106] . 

is much smaller than unity, it may be—and indeed often will be—
convectively non-compact , i.e. the ﬂame length L will be comparable 
or even larger than the length of convective waves. Lieuwen and 
Zinn introduced the ﬂame Strouhal number 
St ≡ f L 
, 
¯u 

(36) 

as the relevant non-dimensional parameter, where  ¯u is a character- 
istic convection velocity. If a ﬂame is convectively non-compact, its 
Strouhal number is of order unity or larger. In that case variations 
in φ(cid:5) along the axial extent of the ﬂame L will reduce the magni- 
tude of the overall ﬂame response because ﬂuctuations in heat re- 
lease  ˙ Q (cid:5) will not be in phase throughout the ﬂame. In other words: 
the ﬂame response will be distributed in time. 

Lieuwen and Zinn [31] present a general expression for a cor- 
rected frequency response factor and develop a closed form result 
in terms of the Strouhal number St for the special case of a conical 
ﬂame. As expected (cf. Fig. 6 ), the distribution of ﬂame response in 
time results in a marked reduction in the gain of the frequency re- 
sponse: For St = 1 , i.e., when the time delays are distributed over 
one period of oscillation, the gain is reduced to less than one third 
of its maximum value. 

Albayrak et al. [106] analyzed the response of laminar, conical 
premixed ﬂames to a modulation of equivalence ratio φ in the time 
domain. Elaborating on ideas originally developed in [15,33] , the 
analysis takes into account not only the effects of equivalence ratio 
ﬂuctuations on the heat of reaction (cid:5)H , but also the impact on 
ﬂame speed S L and ﬂame surface area A (see Fig. 14 ). Closed form 
analytical results in terms of respective impulse response functions 
were obtained by adopting the approach developed by Blumenthal 
et al. for the kinematic response of premixed ﬂames [93] . 

Using  the  notation  and  non-dimensional  variables  introduced 
in Section 3.1 , the impulse response h (cid:5)H  resulting from the ﬁrst 
mechanism, i.e., modulation of heat of reaction, can be written as 
follows: 

h (cid:5)H = 

2 ς (cid:5)H

¯(cid:5)H 

(37) 

Here τ c is the time required for convective transport of fuel from 
the ﬂame base to the ﬂame tip by the mean ﬂow, while ς (cid:5)H ex- 
presses the sensitivity of heat of reaction to equivalence ratio. 

The circumference of a conical ﬂame decreases in a linear man- 
ner from the ﬂame base to the ﬂame tip. Correspondingly, the im- 
pulse response h (cid:5)H —cf. Fig. 10 (left)—decreases linearly from time 
t = 0 to t = τc  as the impulse modulation of equivalence ratio is 
transported convectively along the length of the ﬂame.

The increase in overall ﬂame heat release due to a change in 
ﬂame speed ς L that results from a equivalence ratio ﬂuctuation φ(cid:5) 
is also a local effect, just like the change in heat of reaction (cid:5)H . It

The perturbation of overall ﬂame heat release rate  ˙ Q (cid:5) that re-

L due to ﬂuctuation of equivalence ratio φ(cid:5) is an 
by modulation of S (cid:5)

The shape of the impulse response corresponds to Fig. 11 (left), but 
k < 0. The op- 
with opposite sign, i.e. with negative coeﬃcients h 
posite sign results from the effect that an increase in ﬂame speed 
S L with equivalence ratio, say, will decrease the surface area of a 
conical ﬂame—the ﬂame tends to move upstream and “shrink”—
and  cause  a  corresponding  decrease  in  heat  release  rate.  As  al- 
ready discussed by Huber and Polifke [107] , this negative contribu- 
tion to the overall impulse response to equivalence ratio perturba- 
tion is important because it makes possible excess gain | F | > F (0) 
of the corresponding frequency response; recall the discussion of 
Fig.  5  above.  The  results  of  Hemchandra  [80]  for  the  frequency 
response of a two-dimensional slot ﬂame conﬁguration, obtained 
with  high  resolution,  fully  compressible,  reacting  ﬂow  computa- 
tions, show that this effect can be very pronounced. 

The analysis of Albayrak et al. [106] again identiﬁed the time of 
restoration ˜ τr and the time of convection ˜ τc as relevant time scales 
of premixed ﬂame dynamics. It is emphasized that complete agree- 
ment with  the results of  Shreekrishna et  al.  [108] for  the  ﬂame 
frequency response is observed if the impulse response functions 
h (cid:5)H , h S 

L and h A are Laplace transformed. 

An  extension  of  the  model  that  accounts  for  dispersion  of 
equivalence  ratio  ﬂuctuations  due  to  molecular  diffusion  is  also 
found  in  [106] .  The  starting  point  is  the  spatio-temporal  distri- 
bution of normalized fuel ﬂuctuation φ(cid:5) / ¯φ that develops after a 
Dirac- δ perturbation of strength (cid:7) is imposed at x = 0 , t = 0 ,

The  Peclet  number,  which  is  in  general  deﬁned  as  the  prod- 
uct of relevant velocity and time scales divided by the diffusivity

scales. In the present case,

a  Dirac- δ perturbation  of  strength  unity  (cid:7) = 1 ,  the  r.h.s.  of 
Eq.  (40) is nothing but the Green’s function of the 1D convection- 
diffusion equation and yields for ﬁxed position x the impulse re- 
sponse h CD of a convection-diffusion process [106,109] . 

Albayrak et al. [106] deduced from Eq.  (40) compact, closed 
form expressions for the impulse responses h (cid:5)H , h S 
L  and h A  of a 
premixed ﬂame with dispersive fuel transport – see Eqs. (16) and 
(18) in [106] – and revealed the sensitivity of the premixed ﬂame 
dynamics  to  the  distance  between  ﬂame  and  fuel  injector.  The 
model results compared favorably against numerical simulation of 
a laminar premixed ﬂame, an extension to the case of dispersion 
due  to  turbulence  or  mean  ﬂow  non-uniformity  (“shear  disper- 
sion”) should be straightforward [110] . 

In a subsequent paper, the results were extended to the case 
of non-uniform spatial distribution of equivalence ratio perturba- 
tions [111] . For simple functional forms of the distributions, closed 
form analytical solutions can be obtained, but in general a numer- 
ical treatment is required. These results should be useful for the 
case of practical premixed ﬂames. 

Note  that  the  impulse  response  function  (40)  of  a  1D 
convection-diffusion  process  may  be  mapped  to  the  frequency 
domain  to  obtain  the  corresponding  transfer  function  F CD

This review article concentrates on premixed ﬂames. Neverthe- 
less,  it  seems  appropriate  to  mention  studies  on  the  distributed 
transfer function of non-premixed ﬂame by Tyagi et al. [112] and 
Yao et al. [113] . These analyses are based on the classical Burke- 
Schumann model for laminar, co-ﬂow diffusion ﬂames, which in 
essence describes convection-diffusion of mixture fraction. Thus, it 
is no surprise that resemblance with the results presented in this 
sub-section is observed. 

The  analytical  studies  reviewed  in  this  chapter  contributed 
signiﬁcantly  to  the  understanding  of  fundamental  aspects  of 
ﬂow/ﬂame interactions and helped to identify relevant length and 
time scales. In closing this chapter, we remind the reader that in 
these  studies  a  number  of  simplistic  assumptions  were  invoked, 
such as constant ﬂame speed S L and idealized (thermal) boundary 
and ﬂame anchoring conditions. Most importantly, highly idealized 
models for the mean velocity ﬁeld and the velocity perturbation 
were used, which do not take into account the effect of heat re- 
lease on ﬂuid density and ﬂow [70,71,105] . Therefore one should 
not expect that the models reviewed in this chapter can be directly 
applied to conﬁgurations of applied interest, where one must ex- 
pect signiﬁcant effects of exothermicity, turbulence, swirl, burner 
geometry, etc. “Gray-box” models of ﬂame dynamics, with param- 
eters adjusted to reproduce experimental or computational results, 
have  proven  useful  in  this  context  and  will  be  discussed  in  the 
next Chapter. 

4. Parametric gray-box models 

When  Crocco  [44]  introduced  the  concept  of  sensitive  time 
lag to model combustion instability in rocket engines, he argued 
in  a  rather  general  manner  that  a  time  lag  τ between  injec- 
tion  and  burning  of  propellant  is  a  possible  reason  for  instabil- 
ity.  He states that  the respective times required for heating, va- 
porization and chemical transformation of fuel droplets comprise 
such  a  time  lag  and  observes  that  “if  we  track  a  small  amount 
of...[propellant]...from the injection to the ﬁnal conversion in hot 
gases,...,  practically  all  of  the  chemical  reactions,  and  the  largest 
part of the temperature and volume increase, take place in a very 
short time [interval] near the end of the time delay”. Crocco then 
makes the assumptions that indeed all heat is released at a time τ
after injection, and that this time lag is the same for all particles 
of the propellant, i.e., “particles injected simultaneously are burned 
simultaneously”. The time lag should depend on chamber pressure 
p ; Crocco proposes τ p n = const. with an empirical parameter n as 
a “plausible and simple law of variation”. 

In the case of oscillating pressure, the integrated effect of pres- 
sure  variation  during  heating,  vaporization  and  reaction  deter- 
mines the moment when heat is released, which is ﬁxed by the 
relation

Inserting this relation into the mass balance equation for the en- 
gine  chamber,  Crocco  deduces  a  delay-differential  equation  for 
the ﬂuctuations of chamber pressure p (cid:5) , i.e., an ordinary differen- 
tial equation which includes both p (cid:5) ( t ) and  p (cid:5) (t − τ ) as variables, 
which facilitates the study of the dependence of stability limits on 
a variety of parameters ( τ , n, ω, ...) 

In  the  last  section  of  the  paper  [44] ,  Crocco  explores  the  ef- 
fect of the non-uniformity of the time lag, i.e., he allows for the 
case that different fractions of propellant injected at the same time 
have different time lags. A mathematical formulation for this case 
is constructed by assuming that the propellant is injected through 
N distinct injectors, each one having its individual time lag. The 
total  burning  rate  at  any  given  time  is  evaluated  simply  as  the 
sum over the contributions of the injectors. In order to evaluate 
this  sum,  the  distribution  function  of  the  time  lag  over  the  in- 
jectors must be known. Crocco presumes simple functional forms 
for  this  distribution,  with  a  parameter  (cid:7)
1  that  characterizes  the 
width of the time lag distributions, and goes on to show that “non- 
uniformity of time lag has always a favorable, though not too im- 
portant, effect on stability”. 

Crocco [44] introduced the sensitive time lag model merely as 
a heuristic model to explore some fundamental aspects of combus- 
tion instability in rocket engines. Nevertheless, it was found that—
presumably  after  suitable  tuning  of  parameter  values  n,  τ (and 
(cid:7)
1 )—“the model may represent surprisingly well the actual behav- 
ior of rockets” [59] . 

Since then, the sensitive time lag concept—nowadays frequently 
referred to as the “n - τ -model”—has been used very frequently also 
in the study of combustion instabilities in gas turbines, although 
the physics of liquid-fueled, pressure-sensitive ﬂames in rocket en- 
gines  differs  very  signiﬁcantly  from  velocity-sensitive,  premixed 
ﬂames with gaseous fuels. Note that in the latter context, the sim- 
pliﬁed form introduced by McManus and Poinsot [62] is ubiqui- 
tous, see Eq.  (20) . 

The n - τ -model can be regarded as a parametric gray-box model : 
it  describes  ﬂame  dynamics  in  terms  of  a  presumed  functional 
form and is fully described by a small number of empirical param- 
eters. It is possible to assign physical meaning to those parame- 
ters, but parameter values are frequently not determined from ﬁrst 
principles. Instead, they are “tuned” to match experimental obser- 
vations, or are varied over a certain range in order to study para- 
metric sensitivities. In that sense gray-box model cannot predict, 
but only describe ﬂame dynamics. 

In this section we will review studies of more reﬁned paramet- 
ric gray-box models of ﬂame dynamics, which in distinction to the 
original n - τ -model take into account the effect of a distribution of 
time delays on the FTF and thermoacoustic combustion instability. 
To a surprisingly large extent, developments and results show close 
correspondence to Crocco’s seminal work [44,59] . 

Flohr et al. and Polifke et al. [21,115,116] is the use of steady CFD 
ﬂow ﬁeld data to determine the time delay distribution. A variant 
of that approach was developed by Krebs et al. [118–120] , which 
will be reviewed below (see Section 5.1 ). In this section, we ﬁrst 
discuss the paper [116] , which considered an annular combustor 
as sketched in Fig. 15 , and introduced parametrized Gaussian dis- 
tribution of time delays, which proved useful in several later stud- 
ies. 

4.1.1. Simplistic single time delay model 

As mentioned above, one should expect that in a “practical pre- 
mixed” combustor acoustic ﬂuctuations of pressure p (cid:5) 
1 and veloc- 
ity u (cid:5) 
1 at the fuel injector generate inhomogeneities in equivalence 
ratio φ(cid:5) . In simple terms, a momentary increase in air ﬂow past 
the fuel injector u (cid:5) 
1 > 0 will result in a “pocket” of leaner mixture 
φ(cid:5) 
1 < 0 , which, once it reaches the ﬂame, will result in reduced rate 
of heat release  ˙ Q (cid:5) < 0 [29–31,114] . Polifke et al. [116] 1) considered 
a lean ﬂame, where the heat release is proportional to the equiv- 
alence ratio, 2) assumed a “stiff” fuel injection system, where the 
mass ﬂow rate of fuel does not respond signiﬁcantly to pressure 
perturbations, and 3) neglected variations in ﬂame speed and sur- 
face area that result in general from a modulation of equivalence 
ratio (see Fig. 14 middle and bottom). A representative overall time 
delay  ¯τ is estimated as the residence time in the fuel-air mixing 
section and the “cold” section of the combustor upstream of the 
ﬂame (see Fig. 15 ):

with axial velocities  ¯u 1 and  ¯u 3 , a very simple relation that links the 
respective ﬂuctuations of heat release rate  ˙ Q (cid:5) , equivalence ratio φ(cid:5) 
and acoustic velocity u (cid:5) to each other is obtained [121] :

For harmonic perturbations with angular frequency ω, this leads to

Note  that  here  (and  throughout  this  paper)  the  sign  convention 
exp (+ iωt) for harmonic ﬂuctuations is used, which yields a neg- 
ative phase for a time-delay term. Be aware that the opposite sign 
convention is also popular. 

4.1. Time delays of convective fuel transport 

Several  early  studies  on  thermoacoustic  instabilities  in  lean- 
premixed gas turbines focus on the effect that acoustic ﬂuctuations 
modulate the equivalence ratio at the fuel injector, which after a 
certain time delay causes a ﬂuctuation of ﬂame heat release [29–
31,114] .  In  line  with  these  ideas,  Schuermans  et  al.  [32]  carried 
out a combined analytical/experimental investigation of the ther- 
moacoustic properties of a low-emission gas turbine burner with 
a  premixed,  turbulent,  swirl-stabilized  ﬂame.  A  single  time  de- 
lay  τ for  convective  transport  of  fuel  from  the  injector  to  the 
ﬂame  was  assumed,  such  that  eventually  a  variant  of  the  n - τ - 
model was recovered. Subsequent work by Flohr et al. [21,115] , Po- 
lifke et al. [116] and Sattelmayer [117] extended the formulation of 
Schuermans et al. [32] to include the effect of distributed time de- 
lays of fuel transport. Another commonality between the studies of 

4.1.2. Gaussian time delay distribution 

The assumption that a single time delay  ¯τ as in Eq.  (46) should 
suﬃce to characterize the convective transport of fuel from the in- 
jector to the ﬂame is of course simplistic. For example, an elon- 
gated ﬂame shape implies shorter transport time delays for fuel 
parcels that burn at the “root” of the ﬂame, and conversely longer 
time delays for fuel parcels that burn at the downstream “tip” of 
the ﬂame. Furthermore, the proﬁles of velocity in the mixing sec- 
tion and the combustor are in general non-uniform due to the ef- 
fects of swirl generator, boundary layers, recirculation zones, etc., 
on the ﬂow distribution. Turbulent ﬂuctuations contribute also to 
the dispersion of convectively transported quantities. These effects 
result in a “smeared out” or temporally distributed response of the 
heat release to perturbations of fuel concentration at the injector. 
Clearly, a distribution of delay times should be considered instead 
of one single delay time τ [21,115–117,122,123] .

The  reader  should  recognize  this  transfer  function  as  the  z - 
transform of a causal impulse response, cf. Eq.  (17) . The interpre- 
tation of the coeﬃcients of the impulse response is quite intuitive: 
h φ,k is equal to the fraction of the fuel that arrives during the time 
interval k (cid:5)t ≤ t ≤ (k + 1)(cid:5)t at the ﬂame, where (cid:5)t is a sampling 
interval  (or  time  increment  of  a  discrete-time  model).  In  other 
words: h φ,k represents the distribution of “ﬂight times” of fuel par- 
ticles from the injector to the ﬂame. Replacing Eq. (45) with

yields  a  simplistic  model  for  the  effect  of  a  distribution  of  fuel 
transport  times  on  the  ﬂame  dynamics.  Note  that  an  analogous 
continuous-time  analysis  was  presented  by  Scarinci  and  Free- 
mann [122] . 

Before speciﬁc results for particular burner geometries are re- 
viewed  in  the  next  sub-section,  basic  results  and  general  trends 
concerning  the  impact  of  time  delay  distribution  on  ﬂame  fre- 
quency response and system stability are presented. For this pur- 
pose, we follow [116] and consider the case that the distribution 
of time delays between the fuel injector “1” and the ﬂame “4” is 
described by a Gaussian with mean  ¯τ and standard deviation σ ,

The  left  plot  in  Fig.  16  shows  the  gain  of  the  corresponding 
ﬂame frequency response | F φ ( ω)| as a function of the standard de- 
viation σ normalized with the period 2 π /ω 0 = 1 / f 0  of the oscil- 
lation. The gain decreases with increasing spread of the time de- 
lay and indeed vanishes once the standard deviation is equal to or 
larger  than  approximately  one  half  of  the  period.  Physically,  the 
decreasing  absolute  value  of  the  frequency  response  can  be  ex- 
plained  easily  as  partial  cancellation  between  those  portions  of 
the fuel that arrive early at the ﬂame front, and those that arrive

later. Once the normalized standard deviation of the distribution 
approaches or exceeds a value of 0.5, the spread in fuel transport 
times is so large that heat release by individual fuel parcels is al- 
most completely out of phase with respect to each other, and near 
complete cancellation occurs, cf. Fig. 6 . 

Note that | F φ ( ω)| does not depend on the mean value  ¯τ . Con- 
versely, the phase arg (F ) (right plot in Fig. 16 ) does not depend on 
the standard deviation, whereas it decreases by 2 π when the mean 
value increases by one period of the oscillation. This expresses the 
well-known fact that with increasing time lag, heat release ﬂuctu- 
ations go in and out of phase with respect to combustor acoustics 
[30,31,121] . 

How  does  the  variation  in  fuel  transport  transfer  function 
F φ (ω) with mean and standard deviation of the fuel time delay 
affect combustion stability? Using a low-order network model for 
linear acoustic wave propagation and transmission for the combus- 
tor shown in Fig. 15 , Polifke and Kopitz [116] identiﬁed a dominant 
azimuthally symmetric instability mode with a frequency f 
0  near 
880 Hz. The cycle increment

can be used to characterize the strength of an instability; it equals 
the fraction by which the amplitude of perturbations grows during 
one cycle. Cycle increment and frequency of the dominant insta- 
bility mode computed with Gaussian fuel transport time delay dis- 
tributions are shown in Fig 17 for a range of values of standard 
deviation  σ and  mean  value  ¯τ .  In  these  plots,  the  frequency  f

article.) 

of the dominant mode computed without convective dispersion of 
fuel ( σ → 0) is used for non-dimensionalization. 

The decreasing gain of the fuel transport | F φ ( ω)| with increas- 
ing width σ of the time delay distribution modiﬁes the frequency f 
of the dominant unstable mode only slightly, but reduces its cycle 
increment noticeably and indeed stabilizes the mode for standard 
deviations corresponding to 15% of the oscillation period or larger. 
This is straightforward: with a large spread of time delays, the re- 
sponse of the ﬂame is “smeared out” so strongly that the feedback 
loop between acoustic perturbations and heat release is effectively 
broken, again we refer to Fig. 6 . 

The stability of the eigenmode is more sensitive to changes in 
the mean fuel transport time, see Fig. 17 (b). If the time delay dis- 
tribution is very narrow ( σ → 0), the cycle increment increases 
from −0.5 to 0.1, while the mean value  ¯τ varies by one half of the 
oscillation period. The frequency changes by more than 10%. With 
increasing standard deviation σ , this sensitivity is less pronounced 
and indeed vanishes for σ > 0.5 (not shown). 

The study [116] on the effects of time delay spread with a Gaus- 
sian distribution on FTF and thermoacoustic instability was carried 
out for a speciﬁc conﬁguration of an annular gas turbine combus- 
tor with a simplistic model for the ﬂame dynamics. Nevertheless, 
it seems plausible that the following conclusions are rather gen- 
eral: for thermoacoustic stability, the phase of the transfer func- 
tion F φ is more important than its gain. The former is controlled 
by the mean time delay of fuel transport, the latter by the width 
of the distribution of time delays. This implies that thermoacous- 
tic stability is very sensitive to changes in the mean value of the 
fuel transport time delay, while an increase in the width of the 
time  delay  tends  to  stabilize  unstable  modes.  These  conclusions 
are in line with Crocco’s notion that “non-uniformity of time lag 

has always a favorable, though not too important, effect on stabil- 
ity” [44,59] and have been corroborated since in several studies—
most notably [21,107,115,117,122,124–128] —which will be reviewed 
in subsequent sections. 

Parametric models for ﬂame dynamics that presume a Gaussian 
distribution  of  time  delays—a.k.a.  impulse  response  coeﬃcients—
have been proposed to represent also mechanisms of ﬂow/ﬂame 
interaction that are not related to fuel transport, but to (convec- 
tive) transport of kinematic or vortical perturbations [13–15,17,63] . 
Gaussian distribution have also been proposed for so-called “en- 
tropy  waves”,  i.e.,  convectively  transported  temperature  inhomo- 
geneities as an approximation to Eq.  (40) [129] . These models will 
be discussed in subsequent sections. The choice of a Gaussian dis- 
tribution is quite tenable, given that molecular diffusion or turbu- 
lent dispersion superposed on convective transport tend to gener- 
ate roughly bell-shaped distributions. 

4.1.3. Trapezoidal, uniform and triangular time delay distribution 

Depending  on  fuel  injector  conﬁguration,  mean  ﬂow  proﬁles 
and  strength  of  dispersive  effects,  presumed  distributions  other 
than Gaussian may provide more realistic distributions of convec- 
tive time delays. For example, Sattelmayer [117] argues that non- 
uniform ﬂow proﬁles in the fuel/air mixing section of a premixed 
combustor should result in a distribution of fuel transport time de- 
lays that may be represented by a right-angled trapezoid of width 
2 (cid:5)τ . Its functional form is ﬁxed by three parameters  ¯τ , (cid:5)τ and 
(cid:5)C , which govern mean value, spread and slope of time delays. 
A closed-form, analytical expression for the corresponding transfer 
function | F φ ( ω)| is given in  [117] , but results are then presented 
only  for  the  case  (cid:5)C = 0 ,  i.e.,  a  top-hat  or  uniform  distribution

Sattelmayer  and  Polifke  [130,131]  used  this parametric model to 
assess and extend methods for the computation of the linear sta- 
bility  of  premix  combustors.  The  uniform  time  delay  distribu- 
tion was compared against experimental or computational results 
for the transfer function of premixed ﬂames in a number of pa- 
pers [132–134] . Armitage et al. [133] report that the “time-delay 
spread  model  gives  a  good  representation  of  the  computational 
transfer function. The experimental transfer function is described 
well by a model that combines a time-delay spread with a con- 
stant gain...”. 

Kato et al. [135] used a triangular distribution function to rep- 
resent the spatial distribution of heat release in a dry low emission 
(DLE) combustor and found that it yields more accurate predictions 
of  the  frequency  and  amplitude  of  combustion  oscillations  than 
simpler ﬂame sheet or top-hat ﬂame models. It was concluded that 
consideration of the spatial distribution of heat release rate ﬂuctu- 
ations yields good results for the DLE combustor considered. 

4.2. Superposition of various types of time-delayed ﬂame response 

Early studies on thermo-acoustic instabilities in lean premixed 
gas  turbine  combustors  often  were  concerned  exclusively  with 
the  ﬂame  response  to  ﬂuctuations  in  equivalence  ratio.  How- 
ever,  it  soon  became  apparent  that  other  mechanisms  of  acous- 
tics/ﬂow/ﬂame interaction (see an overview e.g., in Fig. 2 of [15] ) 
can be important and overall ﬂame dynamics should be described 
as a superposition of the responses resulting from the respective 
mechanisms. 

4.2.1. Fluctuations of equivalence ratio and ﬂame speed 

A model proposed by Bellucci et al. [132] accounts for heat re- 
lease  modulation  due  to  ﬂuctuations  of  both  fuel  concentration 
and turbulent ﬂame speed S T . For the former, a top-hat distribu- 
tion as used by Sattelmayer [117] is assumed. For the latter, three 
variants are taken into consideration: First, turbulent ﬂame speed 
S T  proportional to the laminar ﬂame speed S L , which in turn de- 
pends on equivalence ratio. Second, turbulent ﬂame speed is dom- 
inated by turbulent ﬂuctuations and thus independent of acoustic 
perturbations, S (cid:5) 
T = 0 . In this case, the ﬂame position follows the 
acoustic displacement. Third, S (cid:5) 
T = u (cid:5) , thus the ﬂame is at rest. A 
comparison with experiments suggests that “the better prediction 
is achieved with zero ﬂame speed ﬂuctuations, indicating the in- 
dependence of the ﬂame speed on the acoustic ﬁeld”. For an ex- 
tensive discussion of the differences between a ﬂame at rest and a 
ﬂame in convective balance with the ﬂow of premixture, see [136] . 
In a follow-up study, Schuermans et al. [14] operated a gas tur- 
bine  burner  both  in  “practical  premixed” mode,  where  acoustic 
ﬂuctuations  modify  equivalence  ratio  as  discussed  above,  and  in 
“pre-premixed mode”, where fuel is injected far upstream of the 
burner in order to assure constant equivalence ratio at the ﬂame. 
A novel ﬂow-ﬂame interaction mechanism was postulated, which 
relates turbulent ﬂame speed S T to acoustic perturbations via the 
intensity of turbulent ﬂuctuations of velocity. Both the equivalence 
ratio as well as the ﬂame speed mechanism are described by an 
n - τ - σ parametric gray box model (see subsection 4.2.3 ), i.e. a DTD 
22 of the ﬂame 
model with Gaussian distribution. The coeﬃcient T 
transfer matrix, which relates velocity values upstream (index “1”) 
to those downstream (index “2”), thus reads for the practical pre- 
mixed case as

Of course, in pre-premixed mode the second term, which repre- 
sents the contribution of equivalence ratio ﬂuctuations, is absent. 
Also note that the two contributions have opposite sign, such that 
we may expect pronounced excess gain | F | > F (0) for the practical 
premixed case (cf. Fig. 9 in [14] and Fig. 7 ). 

With values of the parameters τ t , σ t , τ φ , σ φ ﬁtted to experi- 
mental data, Schuermans et al. observed excellent agreement be- 
tween model and measurements, see Fig. 18 . 

4.2.2. A comprehensive model of premixed ﬂame dynamics 

Lawn [137,138] investigated a small laboratory swirl burner un- 
dergoing self-excited acoustic oscillations and noted that the spa- 
tial  distribution  of  heat  release  ﬂuctuations  exhibits  roughly  a 
Gaussian bell shape. Depending on the effective velocity of con- 
vection of disturbances, such a spatial distribution of ﬂuctuations 
would  result  in  a  corresponding  temporal  distribution  of  delays. 
This notion was further developed in [15] , where a comprehensive 
model  for  the  response  of  a  premixed  ﬂame  to  acoustic  pertur- 
bations was proposed. A wide variety of possible mechanisms of 
acoustic-ﬂow-ﬂame interactions were reviewed (see Fig. 2 in [15] ), 
the  three  judged  to  be  the  most  important  for  the  burner  test 
rig  under  consideration  were  the  following:  ﬁrst,  kinematic  per- 
turbations of the ﬂame front, i.e., the direct inﬂuence of velocity 
perturbations on position and shape of the ﬂame; second, effects 
of local shearing and large-scale vortex shedding from the burner 
exit on burning velocity and ﬂame area; third, equivalence ratio 
perturbations  of  heat  of  reaction,  velocity,  ﬂame  area  (see  again 
Fig. 14 ). The n - τ - σ parametric model was included as a sub-model 
that  contributes  to  ﬂame  front  and  ﬂame  area  perturbations.  In 
combination with a validated model for the acoustics of the sys- 
tem that had been developed previously [139] , this comprehensive 
model predicted quite well the dependence of eigenmode frequen- 
cies on ﬂow velocity in a laboratory swirl burner for propane and 
methane fuels. Note, however, that in a later study [56] this model 
was found to exhibit incorrect behavior in the limit of zero fre- 
quency. These discrepancies arise from the fact that the underlying 
mean ﬂame structure of the model violates conservation of mass. 
Modiﬁcations to rectify this shortcoming were proposed [56] . 

4.2.3. A parametric model of swirl ﬂame dynamics 

For swirl ﬂames, the propagation of an inertial wave from the 
swirl generator to the ﬂame and the response of the ﬂame to the 
corresponding perturbations of vorticity constitutes an important 
acoustics/ﬂow/ﬂame interaction mechanisms [16,18,20,30,34,63,73] . 
This mechanism was ﬁrst discussed by Richards et al. [30,73] , 
who  observed  that  combustion  oscillations  may  be  promoted  or 
dampened  by  a  change  of  swirl  vane  location.  It  was  suggested 
that the swirler participates in the thermo-acoustic feedback loop, 
as a ﬂuctuation in axial velocity at the swirler will generate a cor- 
responding ﬂuctuation in tangential velocity. The result is a “time 
varying swirl that is delivered to the ﬂame front after a convective 
time delay” [30] . It was not clariﬁed how this vortical variation can 
alter the heat release rate, but it was established that swirl vane 
location plays an important and complex role in dynamic combus- 
tion stability. 

Richards et al. [30,73] could observe a marked inﬂuence of swirl 
vane location on combustion stability, but they did not measure 
the frequency response of swirling ﬂames. This was done in later 
studies at Technical University Munich and at Ècole Centrale Paris, 
which conﬁrmed that the complex dynamic behavior of swirling 
ﬂames results from a superposition of the respective responses to 
ﬂuctuations of mass ﬂow rate, swirl number (or circulation), possi- 
bly also additional effects such as ﬂuctuations of equivalence ratio, 
turbulent ﬂame speed, location and size of vortex breakdown bub- 
ble, etc. [16,18,34,63] .

Fig. 19.  Impulse response of premix swirl ﬂame to perturbations of axial (left) and tangential (right) velocity at the burner exit. Reproduced from [63] . 

Komarek and Polifke [63] in particular investigated the effect 
of changes in axial swirler position on the FTF of a perfectly pre- 
mixed  swirl  burner  with  a  V-type  ﬂame  anchored  on  a  center 
body. Measurements of the frequency response obtained for three 
swirler positions (cid:5)x = 30 ; 90 ; 130 mm upstream of the burner exit 
were  supplemented  with  a  DTD  model  for  the  ﬂame  dynamics. 
Construction  of  this  model  was  guided  by  CFD  studies  (see  be- 
low), which determined separately the respective ﬂame responses 
to perturbations of axial and tangential velocity at the burner exit, 
see Fig. 19 . 

The left plot shows the unit impulse response of the ﬂame to 
a perturbation in axial velocity. The temporal distribution shows 
an  almost  Gaussian  proﬁle,  similar  to  the  spatial  distribution  of 
heat release in the axial direction. Following Lawn [137,138] one 
can argue that this results from the convective transport of dis- 
turbance of ﬂame wrinkles along the ﬂame surface. An increase in 
the axial velocity results in additional mixture being supplied to 
the ﬂame. In the quasi-steady limit, the increase in heat release 
must be directly proportional to the increase in mixture ﬂow rate. 
This implies a low-frequency limit of unity F (ω → 0) = 1 for the 
FTF [56] and a corresponding constraint on the coeﬃcients of the 
impulse response, see Eq.  (18) . 

The  right  plot  of  Fig.  19  shows  the  computed  ﬂame  impulse 
response  to  a  perturbation  of  tangential  velocity,  which  displays 
a  different  characteristic:  the  imposed  modulation  of  circulation 
causes both radial and axial velocity ﬂuctuations downstream of 
the  burner  exit,  which  creates  an  increase  in  both  ﬂame  sur- 
face area and overall heat release rate. This observation was con- 
ﬁrmed by Acharya and Lieuwen [140] , recent analysis of Albayrak 
et al. [75,76] elucidates the origin of this effect. The response in 
heat  release  is  also  distributed  over  time,  but  a  ﬁrst  increase  is 
followed by a decrease of comparable magnitude. This is a neces- 
sary consequence of the low-frequency limit of the response of a 

premixed ﬂame [56] : a ﬂuctuation in circulation does not supply 
more mixture to the ﬂame, thus F (ω → 0) = 0 and according to 
Eq.  (18) the sum over the coeﬃcients h 
k of the unit impulse re- 
sponse must vanish.

Parameter values may be determined from experiment [63] or sim- 
ulation [50,141] . The time delays τ
3 were found to increase 
linearly  with  increasing  distance  of  the  swirler  from  the  burner 
exit. 

2 and τ

Fig. 20 shows that the impact of swirler position on gain and 
phase  of  the  frequency  response  is  profound.  In  particular,  local 
minima in gain with corresponding “jumps” in phase (cf. Fig. 7 ), 
which result from near complete cancellation between the respec- 
tive  responses  to  axial  and  tangential  ﬂuctuations,  are  observed. 
The frequency where cancellation is observed is governed by the 
relative phase lags, c.f. Fig. 3 . It decreases as the swirler is moved 
to upstream positions, where the time delays for transport of the 
swirl wave to the burner exit are larger. This non-trivial behavior 
is reproduced qualitatively with the simple model Eq.  (54) for the 
impulse response. 

4.2.4. The n - τ - σ model - a presumed parametric form of distributed 
delays 

Alemela et al. [17] introduced a novel, “network model-based re- 
gression method ” for measuring the transfer matrix of a perfectly

premixed swirl burner. This method requires a parametric model 
for the ﬂame dynamics. As a generalization of the Gaussian dis- 
tribution described by Eqs.  (49) and (50) the “n - τ - σ model” was 
introduced,

where the interaction index n appears as an additional model pa- 
rameter, which allows one to adjust the gain to experimental mea- 
surements 5 . 

Transfer  matrix  coeﬃcients  obtained  with  the  regression 
method were compared with direct, frequency-by-frequency mea- 
surements  with  a  multi-microphone  technique  [142]  and  also 
a  hybrid  method  that  combines  the  Rankine-Hugoniot  rela- 
tions  with  experimental  results  for  the  FTF  obtained  from  OH ∗- 
chemiluminescence  data  [32,142,143] .  Very  good  consistency  be- 
tween the three techniques was found, providing a global check 
of the respective methods used for determining the thermoacous- 
tic characteristics of ﬂames. The authors also deduce scaling rules 
from a geometric ﬂame length model, which are then used to cal- 
culate FTF for a variety of operation points. The comparison be- 
tween measured and modeled ﬂame lengths as well as the n - τ - σ
parameters shows excellent agreement. 

A  superposition  of  three  n - τ - σ -models  was  used  by  Tay 
et al. [141,144] to describe summarily the effects of thermal bound- 
ary  condition  and  combustor  conﬁnement  on  the  transfer  func- 
tion of a premixed swirl ﬂame. Compared to the original formu- 
lation Eq.  (54) , the interaction index n of the swirl response was 
treated  as  an  adjustable  parameter.  A  value  slightly  larger  than 
unity yielded improved agreement with validation data. 

Bade et al. [145] proposed a design strategy for thermo-acoustic 
stability with the objective of identifying the most stable burner 
geometry for a given combustor. It is based on the premises that 
a model for the stability of the combustor can be formulated and 
that burner design parameters that govern the ﬂame dynamics can

One should be aware, however, that one might not be free to select arbitrary 
values of the parameter n without violating constraints on the low-frequency limit 
of the frequency response [56]

be identiﬁed. Parameter values that minimize the modal growth 
rate may then be determined with an optimization procedure. 

A generic burner design was developed that features signiﬁcant 
variability of dynamical ﬂame response in dependence of two ge- 
ometrical parameters. Parametric models for burner acoustics and 
ﬂame dynamics were formulated and calibrated with experimen- 
tal data. For the former, an l - ζ model [142] was used. For the lat- 
ter, a variant of the n - τ - σ model [17,63] was chosen, with three 
terms  that  represent  the  respective  responses  to  ﬂuctuations  of 
mass ﬂow rate and swirl. This approach was demonstrated for an 
annular combustor. It was found that model parameters correlate 
strongly with the burner geometrical parameters. Once parameters 
were suitably tuned, the parametric burner and ﬂame models ex- 
hibited excellent agreement with experiment (see Fig. 21 ).

Oberleithner et al. [146] linked the frequency dependence and 
saturation of the ﬂame describing function (FDF) gain of a perfectly 
premixed ﬂame to the growth rates of a Kelvin-Helmholtz instabil- 
ity of the underlying base ﬂow. Building on those results, Ober- 
leithner et al. [36] proposed a model for the FDF of a premixed 
swirl  ﬂame  with  two  independent  contributions  to  the  overall 
ﬂame response: The ﬁrst transfer function is attributed to Kelvin- 
H elmholtz  instability  of  the  base  ﬂow.  It  is  determined  by  spa- 
tial integration over the wave number αr and spatial growth rate 
−α
i  of  the  Kelvin-Helmholtz  instability,  computed  by  linear  hy- 
drodynamic stability analysis from time-mean ﬂow proﬁles, which 
were  measured  via  particle  image  velocimetry.  A  second  contri- 
bution stems from swirl-ﬂuctuations generated in the swirler (as 
discussed above) and is described in terms of the model of dis- 
tributed convective time delays Eq.  (54) . The combination of both 
models leads to a good quantitative agreement with the measured 
FDF data. This study introduced a gray-box parametric model of 
the nonlinear ﬂame response with the practical advantage of pre- 
dicting the FDF from stationary ﬂow data. Moreover, the model re- 
veals the mechanisms driving the saturation of the FDF. 

4.3. Nonlinear extensions 

As stated in Section 2.1 , a dynamical SISO system is character- 
ized completely by its impulse response if the system is linear and 
time-invariant. Indeed, the idea that the response to any input sig- 
nal may be expressed as a convolution of the response to an im- 
pulse signal with the input sequence (see Eq.  (7) ), relies on super- 
position, which is an essentially linear concept. 

However, it is well known that at large amplitudes the response 
of a ﬂame to an excitation will in general become nonlinear, such 
that Eq.  (4) will no longer be valid and the system dynamics will 
exhibit typical nonlinear features such as non-sinusoidal oscillation 
with  higher  harmonics,  “clipping” or  saturation  of  the  response, 
etc. The nonlinear behavior of the ﬂame plays a decisive role in 
the dynamics of a fully developed instability. In the simplest case, 
a limit cycle develops, but other dynamic states are also possible 
[6] . 

The  ﬂame  describing  function  (FDF)  has  become  a  popular 
means  to  describe  nonlinear  ﬂame  dynamics  since  it  was  intro- 
duced to the ﬁeld of combustion dynamics [78,84,147] . The FDF is 
a weakly nonlinear description of ﬂame dynamics, since it ignores 
the effects of higher harmonics such as nonlinear modal coupling, 
but it does allow one to estimate limit cycle amplitudes—some ap- 
plications will be presented below—and phenomena such as non- 
linear hysteresis and “triggering” of instabilities [6,78] . 

The FDF may be regarded as an amplitude-dependent FTF. In 
this spirit, Heckl and co-workers have introduced and explored the 
usefulness of amplitude-dependent impulse response functions. In- 
deed,  it  has  been  observed  repeatedly  [68,128]  that  premixed 
swirl ﬂames become shorter and ﬂatter,  thus the distribution of 
time delays more narrow, once instability sets in and oscillation 
amplitudes grow. It is not clear whether the more compact ﬂame 
shapes observed are the root cause of the instability—a more com- 
pact ﬂame, where all ﬂame elements respond roughly in sync to 
a ﬂow perturbation, should have an increased propensity for ther- 
moacoustic instability—or whether they are a result of large am- 
plitude oscillations that modify mean ﬂow and mean ﬂame shape. 
In any case, the idea of representing such a change in ﬂame shape 
and extent with oscillation amplitude as a corresponding change 
in the distribution of time delays is appealing. 

In  [87]  the  FDF  of  a  laminar  premixed  ﬂame  measured  by 
Noiray  [78]  was  expressed  with  a  presumed  functional  form 
Q (t) = n 1 u (t − τ (A )) − n 0 u (t) with an amplitude-dependent time 
delay  τ (A ) = τ0 + τ2 (A/ ¯u ) 2  and  empirical  parameters  n 
i .  A 
variant  of  this  “generalized  n - τ -law”—which  indeed  may  be  re- 

i ,  τ

garded as a special case of a distributed time delay model—with 
amplitude-dependent interaction indices n 
2 ( A ) was proposed 
and combined with a linear, low-order model of system acoustics 
based on Green’s functions [88,89] . 

1 ( A ), n 

i ( A ), τ

i ( A ), σ

Gopinathan  et  al.  [148]  re-formulated  this  concept  and  pro- 
posed to express nonlinear ﬂame dynamics as a superposition of 
several n - τ - σ models (see Eq.  (55) ) with amplitude-dependent co- 
i ( A ). Physically, this extension is motivated 
eﬃcients n 
by the observation that different types of perturbations travel with 
different  speeds  toward  the  ﬂame,  and  that  the  arrival  of  per- 
turbations  at  the  ﬂame  is  spread  out  over  time.  At  large  oscil- 
lation amplitudes the mean ﬂame shape often changes—typically 
the ﬂame shortens – and thus the time delays reduce. Similar ob- 
servations were made by Semlitsch et al. [149] (see below). The 
coeﬃcients  n 
i ( A )  are  treated  as  ﬁtting  parameters, 
and are adjusted with nonlinear optimization techniques to match 
a measured FTF and—at larger amplitudes—FDF. Their amplitude- 
dependence is represented by linear or quadratic functions. With 
only two n - τ - σ models, the FDF of Noiray [78] could be repro- 
duced with very good accuracy. 

i ( A ),  σ

i ( A ),  τ

Iurashev  et  al.  [150,151]  apply  the  approach  proposed  by 
Gopinathan et al.  [148] to a turbulent, premixed swirl burner. The 
linear model of the BRS burner presented in [63] , which was for- 
mulated as a superposition of three n - τ - σ models, is extended to 
the nonlinear case with amplitude dependent coeﬃcients τ
i ( A ) and 
σ
i (A ) , i = 1 , 2 , 3 . Experimental data for the ﬂame dynamics at large 
oscillation  amplitudes  are  not  available  for  the  BRS  burner;  the 
FDF is instead obtained from URANS simulations with the Flame 
Speed Closure (FSC) model. Quantitative validation of the results 
against experiment is not possible due to lack of data, but the re- 
sults obtained are plausible and demonstrate the feasibility of the 
approach. 

Li and Morgans [152] proposed an approach for time domain 
simulation of nonlinear thermoacoustic behavior that is based on 
an extension of the n - τ model with a ﬁrst-order low-pass ﬁlter, 
modiﬁed to account for the nonlinear saturation of the heat release 
rate with perturbation amplitude. Time delay dispersion is not ac- 
counted for, but large velocity disturbances result in a variation of 
the time delay τ . It was observed that this model can reproduce 
important features of nonlinear dynamics such as single tone in- 
stability, “triggering”, “mode switching” and frequency shift during 
the limit cycle. 

Semlitsch  et  al.  [149]  determined  the  nonlinear  dynamics  of 
premixed  ﬂames  with  a  level-set  approach  that  takes  into  ac- 
count the responses to velocity as well as equivalence ratio per- 
turbations.  The  inﬂuence  of  ﬂame  parameters  and  modeling  ap- 
proaches on the time delay distribution and the ﬂame describing 
functions were explored. With a simplistic, analytical velocity ﬂuc- 
tuation model, reasonable agreement of the heat release gain and 
limit cycle frequency with experimental data was achieved. How- 
ever,  the  phase  decay  was  often  over-predicted.  Further  analysis 
showed that large-scale ﬂow structures and turbulence inﬂuence 
signiﬁcantly the phase decay and the gain oscillations due to the 
interference of equivalence ratio perturbations as they travel along 
the ﬂame front. Broadband ﬂow ﬂuctuations disperse the heat re- 
lease response over wider ranges of time delays, which leads to a 
less steep phase decay of the heat release in line with experimen- 
tal data. Semlitsch et al. [149] conclude that the ﬂow ﬁeld needs 
to be modeled realistically in order to obtain the correct heat re- 
lease response, and that analysis in terms of time delay coeﬃcients 
reveals the physics behind the heat release characteristics of the 
ﬂame. 

In closing this section, it is remarked that the literature on sys- 
tem identiﬁcation discusses a variety of methods suitable for non- 
linear systems, such as extended FDFs, neural networks, higher or- 
der transfer functions, harmonic balance or Volterra series. These 

24

methods are typically not “weakly nonlinear”, i.e., they do include 
higher  harmonics  and  modal  coupling.  First  applications  to  un- 
steady heat transfer in laminar ﬂow as well as laminar ﬂames have 
been  reported  [85,86,153–155] ,  but  results  are  not  always  con- 
vincing. Nevertheless, research on these methods is ongoing and 
promises to generate results that go “beyond describing functions”. 

5. Impulse (and frequency) response from CFD 

The previous section introduced a variety of parametric mod- 
els of distributed-delay ﬂame response to perturbations. With such 
a  model  the  ﬂame  dynamics  is  governed  by  a  small  number  of 
(empirical)  parameters,  which  are  usually  not  determined  from 
ﬁrst  principles,  but  in  a  heuristic  way.  This  section  will  review 
approaches that determine DTD model parameters of impulse re- 
sponse coeﬃcients from computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD) sim- 
ulation results. The presentation distinguishes between approaches 
based on steady ﬂow ﬁeld data, and approaches that extract model 
parameters from time series data via system identiﬁcation. 

5.1. Time delay distributions from steady CFD data 

In the papers by Flohr et al. [21] and Polifke et al. [116] , the 
impulse response h φ and the fuel transport transfer function F φ
of premixed swirl burners were estimated with steady CFD. The 
arrival times of a large number of Lagrangian particles convected 
by the mean ﬂow from the injector to the ﬂame and exposed also 
to turbulent dispersion were evaluated. Normalized histograms of 
arrival times may be directly interpreted as coeﬃcients h φ,k of the 
unit impulse response, the fuel transport transfer function F φ (ω) 
is then obtained via z -transform, see Eq.  (17) . Note that this ap- 
proach makes no assumptions on the functional form of time delay 
distributions and is in this regard entirely ﬂexible. 

Distributed  time  delays  and  the  consequential  fall  off of  the 
gain  of  the  ﬂame  response  (see  Fig.  6 )  caused  by  non-uniform 
mean  ﬂow,  axially  distributed  fuel  injectors,  non-planar  ﬂame 
shape and turbulent diffusion can be accounted for. Note, however, 
that there is an important limitation: a decrease in ﬂame surface 
area that may result from an increase in ﬂame speed (cf. Fig. 14 ) 
is not considered. Indeed, if the histogram of arrival times is in- 
terpreted as the impulse response, all coeﬃcients must be greater 
than  or  equal  to  zero,  h φ,k  ≥ 0.  It  follows  that  a  frequency  re- 
sponse determined with this method cannot exhibit excess gain. 
The reader is again referred to Fig. 7 , the discussion in [107] , and 
Section 3.5 , which emphasize that the kinematic response of the 
ﬂame and in particular the restoration process need to be captured 
faithfully in order to generate excess gain. Simplistic models based 
on distributions of arrival times, which do not take into account 
ﬂame movement, cannot capture these effects. 

Flohr et al.  [21] present a model of the transfer function of a 
premixed burner deduced with this approach, compare the model 
with experiment, and discuss how the model can be used to map 
stability characteristics of a combustion system. It is found that the 
model is generally in good agreement with experiments and that 
the model can be used to map the burner stability characteristics 
for various operating conditions, e.g., for variations in power and 
ﬂame temperature. A follow-up study [115] includes a sub-model 
for the acoustic properties of the burner in terms of a loss coef- 
ﬁcient ζ and “reduced length” L 
red . These model parameter are to 
describe the effect of pressure loss and ﬂow inertia on the acoustic 
coupling between plenum and combustion chamber and are also 
deduced from steady velocity ﬁelds determined with CFD. 

Polifke et al. [116] studied the impact of burner nozzle shape on 
thermoacoustic stability. It was found that elliptical nozzles pro- 
duce a more convoluted ﬂame surface with a wider spread of time 

lags, a more pronounced reduction in gain | F | of the frequency re- 
sponse  with  frequency  and  a  slightly  reduced  growth  rate.  This 
conﬁrmed the early results of Crocco [44] as well as experimen- 
tal results on an elliptical swirl stabilized burner.

Instead  of  Lagrangian  transport  of  representative  fuel  “parti- 
cles”, Krebs et al. [118–120] suggested to deduce time delay dis- 
tributions from unsteady dispersion of passive scalars in a statis- 
tically  stationary  ﬂow  ﬁeld.  Two  passive  scalar  ﬁelds  with  inlet 
boundary  conditions (cid:9)
b  is 
located  on  the  inlet  boundary  of  the  computational  domain  are 
transported by the mean ﬂow. The time delay for convective trans- 
port from the inlet boundary to an arbitrary position (cid:2) r within the 
computational domain is then computed as a function of the ra- 
tio of the two scalar ﬁelds, see [118] for details. The advantages 
of such an Eulerian approach for the determination of a convec- 
tive time delay is that it can be evaluated throughout the com- 
putational domain, and that consideration of turbulent dispersion 
is  more  straightforward  than  with  the  Lagrangian approach.  The 
time delay distributions of two variants of a premixed swirl burner 
with  and  without  a  “cylindrical  burner  outlet” (CBO)  were  eval- 
uated with this approach. The ﬂame frequency responses result- 
ing from the distributed time delays were not evaluated explicitly, 
but it was found that an “increase of the width of the time de- 
lay  distribution  will  balance  out  ampliﬁcation  and  damping  and 
usually  will improve thermoacoustic  stability” [118] . This  ﬁnding 
in combination with an increased overall time delay was argued to 
account for favorable thermoacoustic characteristics of the burner 
with CBO. 

A variant of the method of Krebs et al. [118–120] was devel- 
oped by Müller et al. [156] to investigate control authority for ac- 
tive damping of a combustion instability by modulation of the fuel 
ﬂow. The goal of the study was to explain why identical imple- 
mentations of active instability control would be effective on one 
particular premixed combustor geometry, but not on another. Such 
behavior was observed in experiment, and corroborated by corre- 
sponding CFD analysis, where active instability control was imple- 
mented in the computational model. The distribution of the con- 
vective time between fuel injector and ﬂame was evaluated and 
used to estimate the response of the heat release to modulation of 
the fuel mass ﬂow. Dispersion and temporal variation of the con- 
vective time delays were found to be decisive for success or failure 
of active control. It was concluded that modulation of the fuel ﬂow 
for active control is possibly ineffective if the dispersion or tempo- 
ral variation of fuel time delays is too large compared to the period 
of oscillation. This may be the case if the ﬂame is overly long, or 
stabilized too far downstream of the fuel injector, or if there is too 
much spread in the convective times between the injector and the 
ﬂame. 

van  Kampen  et  al.  [157]  computed  FTFs  with  a  linear  coeﬃ- 
cient method, based on a linearization of the unsteady equations 
describing  the  reacting  ﬂow  around  a  steady-state  solution,  and 
compared against results obtained with impulse forcing. The ad- 
vantage of this approach is that time-consuming transient simu- 
lations  are  not  necessary.  The  disadvantage  is  that  it  assumes  a 
ﬂame at rest. Changes in ﬂame surface area resulting from vari- 
ation in ﬂame position consequently are not considered, such that 
frequency responses determined with this method cannot exhibit 
excess gain [107] . 

5.2. Response functions from unsteady CFD and system identiﬁcation 

The convective transport of fuel from the injector to the ﬂame 
front plays an important role in combustion dynamics. The previ- 
ous subsection has reviewed methods to evaluate the correspond- 
ing distribution of time delays from steady ﬂow ﬁeld data. How- 
ever, premixed ﬂame dynamics is governed not only by the local

25 

response of heat release rate to changes in heat of reaction and 
laminar ﬂame speed. Equally important are changes in ﬂame shape 
and ﬂame area that result from changes in ﬂow velocity or ﬂame 
speed, as discussed above. These effects are often referred to as 
the “kinematic response” of a ﬂame to ﬂow perturbations. Addi- 
tional factors may be hydrodynamic instabilities, response to ﬂame 
speed to strain or heat loss, chemical time scales and—for liquid 
fuels—spray atomization, followed by droplet breakup, heating and 
evaporation. Adequate modeling of all these phenomena may be 
required for quantitatively accurate predictions of ﬂame response 
to perturbations. 

Unsteady  Computational  Fluid  Dynamics  (CFD)  simulation  of 
a  (turbulent)  reactive  ﬂow  can  in  principle  resolve  all  relevant 
processes of acoustics/ﬂow/ﬂame- interaction [3,5,158,159] . Indeed, 
unsteady  CFD  simulation  of  a  combustor  with  correct  acoustic 
boundary  conditions  can  predict  (linear)  stability  limits,  nonlin- 
ear  bifurcations  and  also  asymptotic  states,  such  as  limit  cycles 
[5,158] . However, the computational costs of such a “brute force”
approach can be very considerable, especially if one wants to in- 
vestigate a range of operating parameters. Furthermore, it is not 
trivial to extract information from high resolution data sets that 
provides  insight  in  the  mechanisms  and  causal  relationships  of 
acoustic/ﬂow/ﬂame–interactions and can guide the design of more 
stable engines. 

It  is  thus  worthwhile  to  develop  methods—as  a  complement 
rather than a substitute of the “brute force” approach—that allow 
one to determine the impulse response and transfer functions of a 
ﬂame from unsteady numerical simulation. In general terms it is 
rather obvious how one should implement this concept: one car- 
ries out an unsteady simulation of the response of the ﬂame to a 
perturbation and then reconstructs the desired dynamic character- 
istics from the time series data generated in this manner. Insight 
into relevant ﬂame dynamical processes can then be deduced from 
the impulse response and transfer functions. Overall system stabil- 
ity is then investigated—following a divide et impera approach—in 
combination with an acoustic model, such as a low-order network 
method, or a 3D solver of the Helmholtz equation [5,22–24,50,160–
164] . 

As early as 1974, Sklyarov and Furletov [165] determined the 
frequency characteristics of a laminar premixed ﬂame by comput- 
ing numerically its “transition function”, which was deﬁned as the 
response to a unit-step perturbation of pressure. The correspond- 
ing transfer function F (ω) of the ﬂame is then obtained as the 
Laplace-transform of the heat release rate, its impulse response h 
may be computed as the time derivative of the transition function. 
It is thereby possible to determine the FTF for a range of frequen- 
cies from one single unsteady simulation. This approach was ap- 
plied to determine the step and frequency responses of turbulent 
diffusion and premixed ﬂames to velocity perturbations in a se- 
ries of papers by Bohn and co-workers [160,166,167] . Since then, 
the  method  has  been  employed  in  a  number  of  studies  and  is 
particularly useful for laminar conﬁgurations without broad-band 
noise [109,168,169] . 

Alternatively, one can carry out several simulations with har- 
monic  forcing  at  discrete  frequencies  to  determine  the  FFR 
[165,170,171] . This approach will be computationally expensive if 
the frequency response is desired over a range of frequencies with 
ﬁne  frequency  resolution.  The  computational  costs  will  increase 
even more if this methodology is extended to determine the ﬂame 
describing  function  by  carrying  out  simulations  not  only  over  a 
range  of  frequencies,  but  also  over  a  range  of  amplitudes  [172–
174] . Also, continuation of an FFR away from the real axis, which 
is necessary to determine growth rates of thermoacoustic eigen- 
modes,  is  not  a  trivial  matter  [9] .  One  is  confronted  with  simi- 
lar questions if one wants to deduce an FIR model from an FFR 
measured at a discrete set of frequencies. In this case, there are 

trade-offs between accuracy and oversampling, between sampling 
interval vs. frequency resolution, between over-ﬁtting vs. parsimo- 
niousness, and between the choice of an analytical function with- 
out singularities in the complex plane vs. a large number of model 
coeﬃcients. Some of these questions were discussed by Subrama- 
nian et al. [42] , see also Section 2.1.4 . 

This  section  reviews  studies  that  determined  both  linear  im- 
pulse  response  and  FTF  from  CFD  time  series  data  with  system 
identiﬁcation (SI). System identiﬁcation, which nowadays might be 
classiﬁed as a variant of supervised machine learning with the ob- 
jective of generating data-based, reduced-order models, was intro- 
duced  in  the  ﬁeld  of  thermoacoustics  by  Polifke  et  al.  [175,176] . 
In that study, the acoustic transfer matrix of the wire gauze in a 
Rijke  tube  was  estimated  from  CFD  simulation  data  of  unsteady 
heat transfer in pulsating ﬂow across a time-delayed heat source. 
The pulsation was maintained by external, broad-band excitation 
of ﬂow velocity imposed at the boundary of the computation do- 
main. The SI approach based on the Wiener-Hopf equation is es- 
sentially stochastic, as it is based on correlation analysis, and esti- 
mates the FTF for a range of frequencies from one single unsteady 
simulation  run,  even  in  the  presence  of  (turbulent)  noise.  Since 
then, this approach has been further developed and applied to a 
variety  of  problems  in  aero-  and  thermo-acoustics  with  the  ob- 
jective of estimating reduced-order “black box” models from high- 
ﬁdelity simulation data. 

The present review does not give an introduction to the CFD/SI 
methodology. Instead, results obtained for impulse or frequency re- 
sponses  of  velocity-sensitive  premixed  ﬂames  will  be  presented. 
The  CFD/SI  methodology  and  selected  results  in  thermoacous- 
tics  obtained  with  this  approach  were  introduced  and  reviewed 
in  [177,178] .  Best  practice  guidelines  for  successful  and  accurate 
identiﬁcation are found in these reviews. Also note that the Sys- 
tem Identiﬁcation toolbox of MATLAB© makes SI very accessible. 
More recent developments on the use of advanced SI methods in 
aero- and thermoacoustics, quantiﬁcation of uncertainties, impact 
of feedback or noise on identiﬁcation quality, required length of 
time series and the estimation of source terms of noise were re- 
ported in [179–187] . 

But  ﬁrst,  a  word  of  caution:  CFD/SI  estimates  the  ﬂame  im- 
pulse  response  h ,  see  Eq.  (7) ,  from  time  series  data  generated 
with unsteady numerical simulation. The ﬂame transfer function 
F (ω) is then computed as the z -transform of h , see Eq.  (13) . It 
is a frequently encountered misconception that the forcing signal 
imposed  on  the  CFD  simulation  should  be  an  impulse  sequence 
as deﬁned in Eq.  (6) . It is emphasized that this is not the case, 
in general CFD/SI relies on a broad-band signal. It is favorable to 
impose a signal with low auto-correlation and constant amplitude 
over the range of frequencies of interest. For identiﬁcation prob- 
lems with multiple input signals, statistical independence between 
the input channels is required. Discrete binary random signals, or 
Daubechies  wavelets  with  maximum  entropy  have  been  used  to 
generate forcing signals with these properties [188,189] . 

Provided  that  such  broad-band,  random  signals  are  used,  SI 
based on correlation analysis [45,46,178] can effectively ﬁlter out 
the contributions of resolved turbulent ﬂuctuations to the unsteady 
heat  release  rate.  Note  that  this  analysis  is  statistical  in  nature, 
thus one speaks of estimation rather than computation or determi- 
nation of the impulse response. The estimates produced by SI are 
not unique – they depend on choices made during the identiﬁca- 
tion  process:  sampling  interval,  length  of  time  series,  maximum 
number  of  coeﬃcients,  parameters  that  control  regularization  (if 
any), etc. Advanced SI methods [10,4 8,4 9] use regression analysis 
(also test of whiteness ) in order to compute conﬁdence intervals for 
the coeﬃcients of the FIR (and quantities deduced thereof). Uncer- 
tainty quantiﬁcation of SI with applications in aero- and thermoa- 
coustics is discussed in [179–187] . An additional advantage is that 

26

advanced SI based on, e.g., the Box-Jenkins model, estimates not 
only a model for the ﬂame response, but also a model for the com- 
bustion noise source term [185] . This allows to predict the power 
spectral  distribution  of  combustion  noise  in  a  combustor  that  is 
thermoacoustically stable [185,190] , and guarantees in principle an 
unbiased  estimate  of  the  ﬂame  response  if  combustion  noise  is 
“colored” (which is in general the case) [182] . 

Zhu et al. [123,162,191–193] carried out a systematic investiga- 
tion  of  the  “rumble” phenomenon,  which  occurs  in  aero-engine 
combustors at idle and sub-idle conditions typically in the range 
50–120  Hz.  CFD  calculations  were  formulated  in  the  unsteady, 
Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) framework and relied on 
a turbulent spray combustion model with Monte-Carlo simulation 
of Willams’ spray equation. Through calculations of the forced un- 
steady combustion in the presence of a speciﬁed time-dependent 
variation  in  the  air  supply,  a  reduced-order  model  of  the  spray 
ﬂame dynamics, i.e., a spatially resolved transfer function H ( ω, x ) 
between rate of heat release at axial position x and the air ﬂow 
rate through the atomizer, was generated. Instead of a ﬁnite im- 
pulse response (FIR) model, which directly yields the impulse re- 
sponse of the unsteady heat source [175,176] , an auto regressive 
with exogenous input (ARX) model [48] was used in the transfer 
function estimation. Departures from ideal one-dimensional ﬂows 
were described by shape factors. Combining the spray ﬂame trans- 
fer  functions  with  low-order  models  of  the  combustor  acoustics 
made it possible to determine oscillation modes and linear growth 
rates. 

Gentemann et al. [194] applied the CFD/SI approach to a lean 
premixed swirl burner. The impulse response of the ﬂame was es- 
timated from auto- and cross-correlations of signal and response 
through inversion of the so-called Wiener-Hopf equation. The FTF 
was then determined from the impulse response via z -transform 
(see Eq.  (13) ). Validation against experimental data showed qual- 
itative agreement. In particular, excess gain of the ﬂame response 
was correctly reproduced. Quantitative disagreement between esti- 
mated and measured transfer functions were argued to result from 
inadequacies of the 2D, RANS-based combustion model used in the 
study, as well as uncertainties in thermal boundary conditions. In 
general, a strong dependence of results on the distribution of mean 
heat release and the combustion model was observed. 

Giauque et al. [195] compared ﬂame frequency responses ob- 
tained with ﬁltered white-noise forcing and system identiﬁcation 
(SI) against corresponding results obtained with harmonic forcing 
at  selected  frequencies  and  fast  Fourier  transform  (FFT).  Both  a 
laminar ﬂame and a turbulent swirl ﬂame in a complex geometry 
were considered. In contrast to earlier studies, a 3D LES approach 
was used for the latter, using the dynamic thickened ﬂame (DTFM) 
turbulent combustion model [196,197] implemented in the AVBP 
[198] code. It was found that the LES/SI approach gives results that 
compare  well  with  results  obtained  using  harmonic  forcing  (see 
Fig. 22 ), though its computational cost is much lower. The authors 
cautioned, however, that  the SI approach has speciﬁc drawbacks 
that have to be carefully addressed: the method is sensitive to the 
order of the FIR model, i.e., the number of impulse response co- 
eﬃcients h 
k (related to the “memory” of the model). Furthermore, 
attention has to be paid to the spectral properties of the excitation 
signal: its cut-off frequency must be selected judiciously. 

Huber and Polifke [188] discuss the question to what extent ex- 
citation signal type, time series length and signal-to-noise ratio in- 
ﬂuence the accuracy of ﬂame dynamics identiﬁcation. Various cri- 
teria such as the normalized root mean squared prediction error 
Q and the correlation C (cid:7)x between prediction error and input sig- 
nal were introduced, which make it possible ascertain a posteriori 
how well the identiﬁed model represents the true system dynam- 
ics. The inﬂuence of excitation signal type on identiﬁcation qual- 
ity was quantiﬁed for several signal types, i.e., sum of sinusoids, 

broad-band white noise, and discrete random binary signal (DRBS), 
typically low-pass ﬁltered. The DRBS signal was found to have very 
favorable properties. 6 

Furthermore, Huber and Polifke [107,188] introduced the con- 
cept of a multiple-input, single-output (MISO) model structure for 
practical premixed ﬂames. (Perfectly) premixed ﬂames—also called 
“pre-premixed” ﬂames [14] —are typically modeled as single-input, 
single-output (SISO) systems, where the “output” (the overall rate 
of heat release) responds to a single “input” (the velocity at the 
exit of the burner nozzle). However, for practical premixed ﬂames, 
where perturbations of pressure or velocity at the fuel injector(s) 
will modulate the fuel equivalence ratio, the heat release rate will 
respond to ﬂuctuations of equivalence ratio as well as nozzle mass 
ﬂow  rate.  In  this  case,  a  MISO  model  structure  with  two  input 
channels and two ﬂame transfer functions F u (ω) , F φ (ω) is appro- 
priate, with

Here indices “b ” and “i ” refer to the burner exit and the fuel injec- 
tor. Relying on a URANS approach with the TFC combustion model 
of Zimont and Lipatnikov [200] , Huber and Polifke [107,188] con- 
ﬁrmed that in principle the CFD/SI methodology is suitable for de- 
termination of both transfer functions over the full frequency range 
of  interest  from  a  single  CFD  simulation.  However,  identiﬁcation 
of MISO model coeﬃcients remains a challenging task, especially 
in the presence of noise and if computational costs do not allow 
long time series data. Important qualitative insight on ﬂame dy- 
namics was also obtained in that study: movement of the ﬂame 
in response to equivalence ratio ﬂuctuations results in a tempo- 
rary undershoot of heat release rate with impulse response coeﬃ- 
cients h φ,k < 0 for a range of k ’s, which produces excess gain of the 
frequency response F φ ( ω). Consequences for passive design strate- 
gies based on multi-stage fuel injection and experimental work on 
practical  premixed  ﬂame  dynamics  were  also  discussed  (see  be- 
low). 

CF  and  FTF 

Innocenti  et  al.  [35]  adapted  the  MISO  approach  to  investi- 
gate the thermo-acoustic stability of a full-annular lean partially- 
premixed  heavy-duty  gas  turbine  combustor.  Two  ﬂame  transfer 
F ,  which  represent  the  response  to  air 
functions  FTF 
mass  ﬂow  ﬂuctuations  with  a  choked  fuel  line  and  fuel  mass 
ﬂow  ﬂuctuations  with constant air mass ﬂow,  respectively, were 
introduced.  Flame  transfer  functions  identiﬁed  with  URANS/SI—
using  a  variant  of  the  Flamelet  Generated  Manifold  combustion 
model  [201]  adopted  to  partially  premixed  ﬂames— were  com- 
pared  against  each  other  and  physical  insight  on  the  coupling 
mechanisms that govern ﬂame dynamics and combustor stability 
as well as the role of pilot ﬂames was obtained. 

Tay-Wo-Chong  et  al.  [50,141] ,  using  the  same  computational 
framework as Giauque et al. [195] , compared LES/SI results for the 
ﬂame dynamics of  a turbulent premixed swirl ﬂame against ex- 
perimental  data  [63] .  The  characteristic  ingoing  wave  [170]  was 
excited with a low-pass-ﬁltered, discrete random binary signal of 
0.25 s duration at a relative amplitude of 6.5% of the inlet mean 
velocity.  For  a  case  with  30  kW  thermal  power,  the  ﬂame  fre- 
quency response estimated with SI agrees very well with experi- 
ment at frequencies up to 200 Hz. In particular, pronounced ex- 
cess gain at about 100 Hz is correctly observed. At higher frequen- 
cies, where the frequency response is signiﬁcantly weaker with a 
gain of about 0.5, the agreement deteriorates—presumably due to 
decreasing  signal-to-noise  ratio.  For  a  case  with  50  kW  thermal

Alternatives to the DRBS, e.g., a square wave with random variable amplitude 
[199] or a signal based on Daubechies wavelets [189] were proposed and validated 
with favorable results

power, Tay-Wo-Chong et al. [141] encountered a transversal unsta- 
ble mode, which grew to signiﬁcant oscillation amplitudes in about 
0.1 s. The corresponding spurious contributions to the auto- and 
cross-correlations of signal and response, respectively, deteriorated 
signiﬁcantly the quality of the identiﬁcation results. 

The FTF obtained from LES/SI was parametrized in terms of the 
distributed time delay model Eq.  (54) , such that the sensitivity of 
the FTF to these parameters could be explored. A subsequent pa- 
per [50] compared frequency responses reported in [141] against 
results obtained with an unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier Stokes 
(URANS),  which  relied  on  the  TFC  combustion  model  [200] .  The 
URANS/TFC  model  under-predicted  the  ﬂame  length,  which  re- 
sulted  in  under-predicted  phase  lag  of  the  frequency  response, 
and  under-predicted  cycle  increment  as  well  as  over-predicted 
frequency  of  the  dominant  unstable  mode  of  the  test  rig.  With 
a  Flamelet-Generated  Manifolds  instead  of  the  TFC  combustion 
model, Innocenti et al. [202] improved signiﬁcantly the agreement 
of  the  estimated  ﬂame  response  with  experimental  data  for  the 
30  kW  BRS  test  case.  Noticeable  discrepancies  remained  for  the 
phase at frequencies above 200 Hz, but this did not affect the pre- 
diction of the dominant unstable mode at about 110 Hz. Iurashev 
et al. continued in this vein, exploring the suitability of the Flame 
Speed  Closure  model  of  Lipatnikov  and  Chomiak  [203]  to  accu- 
rately model ﬂame dynamics and predict thermoacoustic stability 
limits [150,151,204] . It was observed that it is essential to take into 
account the combined effect of heat loss and strain on the heat 
release rates [205] in order to correctly predict the ﬂame dynam- 
ics. Similarly, Mejia et al. [206] observed a pronounced effect of 
heat losses induced by reduced ﬂame-holder temperature on the 
transfer  function  of  a  laminar  ﬂame.  The  corresponding  impulse 
response distributions are shown in [52] . 

The validation studies [50,141,202] with the CFD/SI approach in- 
dicated that even slight errors in the prediction of the mean or 
ﬂuctuating values of heat release rate will result in signiﬁcant gain 
or phase error for the FTF and subsequent errors for thermoacous- 
tic  stability  analysis.  The  sensitivity  of  LES/SI  results  to  thermal 
boundary conditions and combustor conﬁnement was investigated 
in [144] . Using an “extended TFC” combustion model formulated in 
the LES context that accounts for the combined effects of stretch 
and heat loss on heat release rate of a premixed ﬂame in a non- 
adiabatic combustor [205] , Tay-Wo-Chong et al. [207] achieved ex- 
cellent  agreement  for  the  mean  ﬂame  shape  and  the  ﬂame  fre- 
quency  response  of  both  the  30  kW  and  the  50  kW  operating 
points of the BRS burner [141] , see Fig. 23 .

et  al.  [123,162,192,193] ,  only  a  small  number  of  studies  have 
investigated  the  impulse  response  or  transfer  function  of  spray 
ﬂames.  Andreini  et  al.  [134]  employ  simplistic  analytical  formu- 
lations for the ﬂame dynamics—such as the uniform distribution 

of time delays discussed in Section 4.1.3 —for the thermoacoustic 
analysis of a tubular combustor equipped with a PERM (Partially 
Evaporating and Rapid Mixing) injection system. In a subsequent 
numerical study of this combustor [208] , the complex interactions 
between  acoustics  and  a  turbulent  spray  ﬂame  were  studied 
numerically using URANS/SI, with a focus on the effects of liquid 
fuel evolution and droplet dynamics on the spray ﬂame response. 
A  multi-parameter,  distributed  time  delay  model  of  a  reheat 
combustor was presented in [209,210] . Reheat ﬂames are mainly 
auto-ignition  stabilized,  hence  the  ﬂame  was  conceptualized  as 
a  multiple-input  multiple-output  (MIMO)  system.  An  Eulerian 
stochastic ﬁelds combustion model [211] that relied on a compos- 
ite progress variable to represent the build-up of precursor radicals 
was used [212,213] . LES were forced with uncorrelated broadband 
signals to extract the impulse response and transfer functions from 
time series data (cf. Section 5.2 ). The respective effects of axial ve- 
locity, temperature, equivalence ratio and pressure ﬂuctuations on 
the ﬂame response could be quantiﬁed. It was concluded that the 
standard FTF does not adequately describe the dynamic behavior 
of reheat ﬂames. 

Li et al. [214,215] identiﬁed impulse response and ﬂame trans- 
fer functions of liquid-oxygen/kerosene bi-swirl injectors from LES 
time series data. An in-house code with steady laminar ﬂamelet li- 
brary was used. As an alternative to inversion of the Wiener-Hopf 
equation  supplemented  with  a  regularization  term,  a  Bayesian 
Lasso approach was proposed to quantify the uncertainty of ther- 
moacoustic  stability  analysis.  It  was  reported  that  this  novel 
method for LES/SI with integrated uncertainty quantiﬁcation can 
capture  the  dominant  dynamics  of  the  injectors.  Alternative  ap- 
proaches to quantify uncertainties in estimated ﬂame impulse and 
transfer functions are polynomial chaos expansion [216] , the active 
subspace approach [186] , or an analytical dimensionality reduction 
approach [217] . Forward propagation of uncertainties for thermoa- 
coustic stability analysis is also possible with these methods. 

This section closes with a comment on the use of system identi- 
ﬁcation in experiment. In principle, it should be possible to impose 
broad-band forcing in experiment and deduce the ﬂame impulse 
response from time series data of velocity and heat release rate 
by inversion of the Wiener-Hopf equation. This was demonstrated 
by Cuquel et al. [99] , who examined a variety of techniques to de- 
termine the transfer function of a laminar ﬂame to ﬂow rate dis- 
turbances, and concluded that “random velocity perturbations can 
be used instead of harmonic signals to obtain results with a bet- 
ter frequency resolution in a shorter time.” However, the authors 
cautioned that there is sensitivity to the number of samples and 
parameters in the SI technique, and that agreement between har- 
monic forcing and broad-band forcing deteriorates with increasing 
amplitudes. This is unavoidable, given that a system identiﬁcation 
technique was employed that assumes linear, time-invariant sys-

6. Utilizations of the concept of distributed delays 

This  section  discusses  ﬁrst  how  spatially  distributed,  acousti- 
cally non-compact ﬂames may be described favorably in terms of 
distributed delays. Then it is reviewed how the reduction of trans- 
fer function gain that in general results from a distribution of de- 
lays has been utilized as a means of passive control of combustion 
instabilities. Finally, we show that the convective dispersion of en- 
tropy waves is conveniently represented in terms of distributed de- 
lays. 

6.1. Spatially distributed heat release 

The majority of studies reviewed above describe the ﬂame dy- 
namics in terms of the ﬂuctuations of overall heat release rate  ˙ Q (cid:5) 
and corresponding global impulse response h and ﬂame transfer 
function F, see Eqs.  (1) and (17) . 

6.1.1. Distributed delays as a consequence of spatial distribution 

If  a  ﬂame  is  acoustically  compact,  i.e.,  if  its  spatial  extent  is 
much  smaller  than  an  acoustic  wavelength,  the  spatial  distribu- 
tion of heat release ﬂuctuations is in sense irrelevant for thermoa- 
coustic stability. This can be shown by considering the Rayleigh in- 
dex: 
(cid:4) 
T 

(cid:5) ( (cid:2) x , t) ˙ q 
p

(cid:5) ( (cid:2) x , t) d V d t = 
˙ q 
V F 
(cid:5) (t) dt. 

(57) 

Here we have assumed that the pressure ﬂuctuations p (cid:5) are uni- 
form within the volume V F —an assumption that is justiﬁed for a 
compact ﬂame. In this case, total ﬂuctuating heat release rate  ˙ Q (cid:5) 
of the ﬂame may be evaluated simply as the integral over the vol- 
umetric density of ﬂuctuations of the heat release rate  ˙ q (cid:5) . One may 
conclude that for compact ﬂames the spatial distribution of the lat- 
ter is effectively irrelevant for thermoacoustic driving. 

a  corresponding  temporal  distribution:  upstream  sections  of  the 
ﬂame respond early, downstream sections respond later. For exam- 
ple, Varoquie et al. [218] resolved the spatial distribution of heat 
release rate ﬂuctuations of a turbulent, non-premixed ﬂame and 
determined local values of gain and phase of the FTF, expressed 
in  terms  of  a  local  interaction  index  n x  and  a  time  lag  τ x ,  see 
Fig. 24 . Corresponding analyses for premixed ﬂames were reported 
in [133,171,192] . 

This correspondence is a result of convection of perturbations 
of ﬂame shape, equivalence ratio, vorticity, etc., from the anchor- 
ing point to the tip of the ﬂame. In that sense the spatio-temporal 
distribution of  ˙ q (cid:5) is very important for thermoacoustics 7 because it 
governs the temporal distribution of the overall heat release ﬂuc- 
tuations  ˙ Q (cid:5) . For the sake of the argument, assume that the local 
values of interaction index n x and time lag τ x are independent of 
frequency. Then it is straightforward to generate the ﬂame impulse 
response h , which describes how the overall heat release rate  ˙ Q (cid:5) 
responds to upstream velocity perturbations, from spatial distribu- 
tions of n x and τ x . Indeed, if τ x increases linearly with position x , 
there is a 1:1 correspondence between temporal and spatial distri- 
butions of ﬂame heat release rate—the two distributions are iden- 
tical  up  to  a  re-scaling  of  the  abscissa!  The  examples  discussed 
in  Section  2.2  indicate  that  the  gain  and  to  a  lesser  extent  also 
the phase of a global ﬂame transfer function F that results from 
distributed time delays will exhibit non-trivial dependence on fre- 
quency, even if the coeﬃcients n x and τ x are independent of fre- 
quency. 

In  the  general  case,  the  local  ﬂame  dynamics  will  be  non- 
trivial,  such  that  it  cannot  be  described  by  a  local  n - τ -model 
with frequency-independent coeﬃcients n x , τ x . For example, Zhu 
et al. [192] represented the local ﬂame dynamics in terms of in- 
ﬁnite impulse response (IIR) ﬁlters. The principle of superposition 
assures that the global ﬂame transfer function F ( ω) may be com- 
puted also in this case—as long as the ﬂame dynamics is in the 
linear regime. 

6.1.2. Acoustically non-compact ﬂames 

For acoustically non-compact ﬂames, i.e. ﬂames with a spatial 
extant of the same order as the acoustic wavelength, one should 
expect that variations of gain and phase of pressure ﬂuctuations 

However, it has been observed repeatedly that the spatial dis- 
tribution  of  heat  release  ﬂuctuations  is  strongly  associated  with

Note the analogy to the “time of ﬂight” approaches reviewed in previous section

p (cid:5) ( (cid:2) x , t)  within  the  ﬂame  volume  V F  inﬂuence  the  generation  of 
combustion noise [219] and correspondingly also thermoacoustic 
driving in a decisive manner, see Eq.  (57) . Kim et al. [19] discuss 
this  effect  and  describe  a  methodology  based  on  the  superposi- 
tion principle to incorporate experimentally determined local FTFs 
into an analytic thermoacoustic model: the global FTF is computed 
as a sum of local FTFs, weighted by the ratio of the local to the 
total mean heat release rates. The authors conclude that for non- 
compact ﬂames model predictions calculated using the local FTF 
are better than predictions made using the global FTFs. Note, how- 
ever, that non-compactness of the ﬂame is actually not properly 
considered in the model. The characteristic Eq. (27) in [19] does 
not  take  into  account  variable  gain  and  phase  of  pressure  ﬂuc- 
tuations along the length of the ﬂame. Differences observed be- 
tween results obtained with spatially distributed and global heat 
release rates, respectively, are perhaps due to the presumed func- 
tional form of the FTF (a 2nd order model), which possibly does 
not represent the global ﬂame dynamics well. 

A low-order model for thermoacoustic stability prediction that 
takes into account the effect of variable gain and phase of pressure 
ﬂuctuations  p (cid:5) ( (cid:2) x , t)  (and  also  mean  temperature  variation  ¯T (x ) ) 
along the ﬂame was proposed by Leandro and Polifke [220] . The 
ﬂame is modeled as a sequence of interconnected elements, each 
one  consisting  of  an  acoustically  compact  ﬂame,  followed  by  a 
duct. This approach builds on Dowling and Stow [221] , who de- 
scribed  the  effects  of  non-uniform  temperature  on  the  resonant 
frequency of a non-compact region and yields the transfer matrix 
of a non-compact ﬂame. Li et al. [222] extend this ansatz to model 
the limit cycle of a long ﬂame in the ORACLES test rig [223] . A se- 
ries of local, weakly nonlinear ﬂame describing functions (FDF), one 
for the heat release rate response within each segment to velocity 
forcing at a ﬁxed reference location, are extracted from LES and 
incorporated in a low-order, wave-based network model. Note that 
the compact acoustic jump conditions across interconnected ﬂame 
elements take into account also “entropy waves” (see Section 6.3 ). 
Limit cycle predicted by the low-order coupled method agree well 
with solutions of continuous 1-D linearized Euler equations. 

Pankiewitz and Sattelmayer [224] and Nicoud et al. [41] have 
introduced  hybrid  approaches  for  thermoacoustic  stability  analy- 
sis, which solve the Helmholtz equation with a source term due 
to unsteady heat release with the ﬁnite element or ﬁnite volume 
method. The source term is to describe the unsteady response of 
the ﬂame to acoustic ﬂuctuations and is formulated in terms of an 
FTF or FDF, typically with a spatially varying time delay. For exam- 
ple, Pankiewitz and Sattelmayer [224] suggest 

(cid:9)
(cid:5) ( (cid:2) x , t) =  ˙ q 
(cid:5) 
˙ q 

(cid:10)
(p, (cid:2) u )( (cid:2) x , t; τ ( (cid:2) x )) 

(58) 

with a non-linear dependence on p, (cid:2) u to avoid unlimited growth of 
oscillation amplitudes. With such an approach, it is straightforward 
to take into account the spatial distribution of heat release rate in 
non-compact ﬂames. As an added beneﬁt, a spatially distributed 

heat release increases stability of computations and reduces reso- 
lution requirements as well as computational cost. 

The original studies [41,224] relied on simplistic models for the 
distribution of time delays τ ( (cid:2) x ) . Campa et al. [225] used data from 
steady CFD simulations to obtain a distribution of ﬂame transfer 
functions  of  the  n - τ type:  the  interaction  index  n  was  assumed 
to be proportional to the mean heat release rate, the time delay 
τ was estimated on the basis of the trajectories of the fuel parti- 
cles from the injection point in the burner to the ﬂame front (see 
Section 5.1 ). Comparison with results obtained with a concentrated 
ﬂame demonstrated that the spatial distributions of n and τ can 
have a noticeable inﬂuence on eigenfrequencies and growth rates 
of eigenmodes. A follow up study [226] considered the ﬂame re- 
sponse to equivalence ratio ﬂuctuations, relying on the local “time 
of  ﬂight” of  fuel  particles  from  the  injection  point  to  the  ﬂame 
front to determine distributed delays τ ( (cid:2) x ) . 

Laera et al. [79] extended this approach for non-compact ﬂames 
to  the  weakly  nonlinear  case  by  incorporating  a  spatially  dis- 
tributed ﬂame describing function in a ﬁnite element solver for the 
wave equation. Unlike Silva et al. [163] , the authors did not assume 
that gain and phase of FDF are independent of position within the 
chamber. A good match between numerical predictions and exper- 
iments in terms of frequency and shape of the unstable mode was 
achieved. The estimate of the limit cycle oscillation was less satis- 
factory. 

6.2. Distributed delay as a means of passive control 

When  reviewing  means  of  passive  control  of  combustion  dy- 
namics  in  gas  turbines,  Richards  et  al.  [124]  comment  that  any 
attempt  to  improve  stability  should  recognize  the  contribution 
of  time-delay  distributions  in  the  premixing  process.  Indeed,  the 
discussion  in  Sections  2.2.3  and  4.1.2  of  the  present  review,  see 
Figs. 6 and 16 , suggests that a wider distribution of time delays 
results in general in a more pronounced low-pass characteristic of 
the ﬂame. For a given frequency this translates into reduced trans- 
fer function gain, which in turn should reduce the propensity of a 
combustor for self-excited thermoacoustic oscillation. This section 
reviews two strategies for passive control of combustion instability 
that rely on this concept. 

6.2.1. Distributed fuel injection 

In  premixed  combustion,  the  distribution  of  time  delays  for 
convective  transport  of  fuel  from  the  injector  of  the  ﬂame  may 
be  widened  by  injecting  the  fuel  not  at  a  single  axial  location, 
but distributed over a certain axial extent. This was well under- 
stood by Keller [29] , who argues that the fuel should be injected 
over a length that corresponds at least to the product of combus- 
tor length and the Mach number upstream of the primary zone of 
combustion. In other words, the axial extent of the fuel injection 
system should be larger than a convective wavelength (the prod- 
uct of mean ﬂow velocity and period of oscillation).

For the special case of a two-port fuel injection system, vari- 
ations  of  fuel-to-air  ratio  (FAR)  generated  at  the  upstream  fuel 
port  can  effectively  be  canceled  at  the  downstream  fuel  port  if 
the time for transport between ports is exactly 1/2 of the acous- 
tic period spacing between the fuel ports. This concept was sub- 
stantiated by Straub and Richards [30] , who observed signiﬁcant 
reduction of RMS pressure levels in a premixed combustor when 
fuel was injected at two axial locations. However, given that a re- 
duction in oscillation amplitudes was observed at various frequen- 
cies, the authors caution that cancellation of the FAR variation be- 
tween upstream and downstream ports is not alone responsible for 
the favorable properties of two-port injection. Scarinci and Free- 
man [122] proposed a simple analytical model for a two-port fuel 
injection  system.  The  effect  of  turbulent  dispersion  on  FAR  was 
taken into account by a spatio-temporal mixing model that gen- 
erated Gaussian distributions of fuel arrival times at the premixer 
exit, with a corresponding reduction in transfer function gain (cf. 
Section 4.1.2 ). 

A fuel/air premixing system for an industrial gas turbine pro- 
posed  by  Scarinci  et  al.  [125]  also  exploits  the  idea  that  the 
fuel/air  injection  and  mixing  process  should  be  distributed  over 
a  convective  wavelength  in  order  to  eliminate  (or  weaken)  the 
modulation of the FAR by acoustic oscillations. However, Scarinci 
et al. [125] turn the idea of distributed fuel injection on its head: 
the decoupling is achieved by a “phased” injection of air through 
an array of holes in the mixing ducts to produce a fuel-air mixture 
that is both spatially and temporally uniform. In ﬁeld trials on a 
35:1 pressure ratio engine, this mixing technique reduced (or even 
eliminated) combustion instabilities over a wide range of engine 
operating conditions, while producing excellent NO x and CO levels. 
Chishty et al. [126,127] present a theoretical and experimental 
framework to characterize and optimize the capability of fuel/air 
premixers to dampen FAR oscillations and thereby control combus- 
tion instabilities by passive means. Results are presented in terms 
of the arrival time distribution (in the time domain) or the trans- 
fer function (in the frequency domain) of a fuel-air premixer. Note 
that the former should be recognized as the impulse response h φ
introduced in Eq.  (47) . A quasi-1D model for the effects of con- 
vection and (turbulent) dispersion on the arrival time distribution 
of a premixer is presented, results correspond to Eqs.  (40) and 
(42) ,  i.e.,  h φ − h CD .  Optimal  damping  is  achieved  when  the  ratio 
of Peclet number Pe t —deﬁned in terms an effective or turbulent 
diffusivity D t —to Strouhal number St is approximately equal to 6. 
For this particular condition, the distribution of fuel transport time 
delays  is  optimal  in  the  sense  that  the  coherence  between  in- 
coming  and  outgoing  perturbations  is  minimal.  For  larger  Peclet 
numbers, mixing is not suﬃcient to dampen incoming FAR ﬂuc- 
tuations, while for smaller Peclet numbers FAR perturbations are 
transferred without signiﬁcant attenuation to the premixer outlet. 
Chishty et al [127] also present results of experimental investiga- 
tions, which were conducted to verify the model predictions, and 
assess the effects of modulation amplitude and frequency, as well 
as pressure drop across the premixer on the damping effectiveness 
of the premixer. Results indicate that modulation amplitude has a 
profound effect on premixer performance, whereas pressure drop 
effects are insigniﬁcant. 

The studies discussed up to now in this section assumed that 
the fuel ﬂow rate is not affected by acoustic ﬂuctuations, i.e., that 
the fuel supply is “acoustically stiff”. Using a low-order network 
model representative of a technically premixed swirl burner, Hu- 
ber and Polifke [107,188,227,228] explored whether it is possible 
to reduce or eliminate oscillation amplitudes by judiciously choos- 
ing the impedances of fuel supply ports in a multi-port injection 
system.  Mixing  and  transport  of  the  fuel  from  the  injector(s)  to 
the  ﬂame,  but  also  the  kinematic  response  of  the  ﬂame  to  up- 
stream  ﬂow  velocity,  and  combined effects  such  as  the  modula- 

tion  of  ﬂame  speed  and  position  due  to  equivalence  ratio  per- 
turbations  were  taken  into  account.  The  respective  impulse  and 
frequency response functions of this MISO (multiple-input, single- 
output) ansatz were obtained with system identiﬁcation from CFD 
time series data (cf. Section 5.2 ). Excess gain in the frequency re- 
sponse F φ to equivalence ratio ﬂuctuations could be explained in 
terms of the corresponding impulse response, which shows nega- 
tive values at late times (cf. Figs. 5 and 7 ). It was demonstrated 
that location and impedance of fuel supply ports indeed control 
the amplitude of equivalence ratio ﬂuctuations as well as the rela- 
tive phase of F u , F φ and thereby provide a means for passive con- 
trol of combustion instabilities. Interestingly, a control strategy that 
aims for destructive interference between the kinematic response 
F u and the response to equivalence ratio F φ may be more promis- 
ing than a strategy that strives to minimize F φ by dampening FAR 
ﬂuctuations. The results of the study also demonstrate that it is 
quite diﬃcult to minimize the overall ﬂame response to acoustic 
perturbations over a wide range of frequencies or for a variety of 
thermo-acoustic eigenmodes. 

6.2.2. Variation of ﬂame properties between burners 

Gas turbine combustion chambers are typically equipped with 
several  burners.  An  established  strategy  of  passive  control  relies 
on  judiciously  introducing  differences  between  individual  burn- 
ers,  one  speaks  of  “de-tuning” of  burners  (also  “burner  group- 
ing”, “staging” or “symmetry-breaking”). Such de-tuning of individ- 
ual burners may be achieved by introducing differences in FAR or 
pilot fuel mass ﬂow rate for individual burners, which increases 
the overall spread of time delays that the combustor is exposed 
to  [158,229,230] .  The  reader  should  be  cautioned,  however,  that 
this approach usually comes at the cost of increased emissions of 
oxides of nitrogen or carbon monoxide. 

Noteworthy improvement of thermoacoustic stability—without 
signiﬁcant  NO x -penalty—was  achieved  by  Berenbrink  and  Hoff- 
mann, who equipped a sub-set of burners of an annular combus- 
tor with a “cylindrical burner outlet”, which increased the ﬂame 
time delay [231] . A related strategy for controlling thermoacous- 
tic instabilities of multi-burner combustion systems was proposed 
by Noiray et al. [232] . A “dynamic phase converter” is inserted in 
a sub-set of burners (or injection channels), which should widen 
the time delay distribution of the ﬂame collection to obtain as a 
result a vanishing or at least reduced overall response to incident 
perturbations. 

The strategies for passive control of thermoacoustic instabilities 
of premixed ﬂames reviewed in this section have concentrated on 
increasing the axial extent of fuel injection or the convective dis- 
persion of fuel transport. However, it is also possible to realize a 
wider distribution of ﬂame time delays—and thereby decrease the 
FTF gain—by increasing the axial extent of the ﬂame . Conversely, 
a more compact ﬂame, where all ﬂame elements respond roughly 
in sync to a ﬂow perturbation, should have an increased propen- 
sity  for  thermoacoustic  instability.  This  was  recognized  and  dis- 
cussed explicitly, e.g., in [68,128] , who observed that a premixed 
swirl ﬂame becomes shorter and ﬂatter,  thus the distribution of 
time delays more narrow, when instability occurs. Unfortunately, it 
is not clear whether the more compact ﬂame shapes observed are 
the root cause of the instability, or whether they are a result of 
large amplitude limit cycle oscillations that modify mean ﬂow and 
mean ﬂame shape. Furthermore, the change in mean time delay 
(and thus overall phase of the ﬂame response) that results from 
the  reduction  in  ﬂame  length  may  be  more  decisive  for  stabil- 
ity than any change in the width of time delay distributions (cf. 
Fig. 16 ).

6.3. Convective dispersion of entropy waves 

Acceleration  of  gas  containing  zones  of  nonuniform  density 
generates sound [233,234] . Density, composition and temperature 
in a combustion chamber downstream of the ﬂame may be non- 
uniform  due  to  imperfect  pre-mixing  of  fuel  and  air,  mixing  of 
combustion products with cooling air, heat loss to combustor walls, 
or  incomplete  combustion,  etc.  Such  inhomogeneities  are  trans- 
ported by the mean ﬂow through the combustion chamber. One 
speaks  of  “entropy  spots”,  frequently  also—in  spite  of  the  con- 
vective transport mechanism—of “entropy waves”. As the inhomo- 
geneities  enter  the  turbine  stator  row  or  a  nozzle,  they  are  ac- 
celerated and generate acoustic disturbances. This mechanism of 
interaction  between  entropy  and  acoustic  waves  was  identiﬁed 
as a potentially signiﬁcant contributor to roughness and instabil- 
ity  of  rocket  engines,  aero-engine  afterburners  and  gas  turbines 
[114,235–238] .  Characteristic  frequencies  of  self-excited  instabili- 
ties resulting from ﬂow-ﬂame-entropy-acoustic feedback were ar- 
gued  to  be  quite  low,  with  oscillation  periods  corresponding  to 
the  time  scale  of  convection  through  the  combustion  chamber. 
Accordingly,  one  speaks  of  “rumble” in  aero-engines  or  “chug- 
ging” in rocket engines. At higher frequencies entropy waves have 
short wavelengths and will be dispersed due to non-uniform mean 
ﬂow and (turbulent) diffusion in a combustor [29,117,143] . The re- 
sulting  increase  in  the  spread  of  convective  time  delays  should 
largely  suppress  resonant  feedback  cycles  that  involve  entropy 
waves  (cf.  the  effect  of  “smeared  out” ﬂuctuations  in  FAR  dis- 
cussed  in  Section  6.2 ).  Besides  self-excited  instabilities,  “indirect 
combustion noise” due entropy waves may be a signiﬁcant con- 
tributor to the overall noise emissions produced by modern aircraft 
[5,236,238,239] . 8 

A low-order model for the contribution of convected entropy 
inhomogeneities  to  thermo-acoustic  feedback  in  a  combustion 
chamber was introduced by Dowling [240] , based upon [39,235] . 
Consequences for frequencies and growth rates of thermoacoustic 
eigenmodes were explored by Hubbard and Dowling [114] . Polifke 
et al. [121,241] argued that feedback between acoustic and entropy 
waves  may  be  constructive  as  well  as  destructive.  Using  a  low- 
order model of thermoacoustic interactions in an annular combus- 
tor it was observed that entropy waves can indeed be a stabiliz- 
ing factor in combustion dynamics. It was also pointed out that in 
lean-premixed combustion, entropy waves originate predominantly 
from ﬂuctuations of the equivalence ratio of the air-fuel mixture 
upstream of the ﬂame, provided that combustion is complete and 
that  heat  losses  due  to  convective  or  radiative  heat  transfer  are 
negligible. This notion was reinforced in later studies by Strobio- 
Chen et al. [136,242] and Steinbacheret al. [109] , who scrutinized 
the role of ﬂame movement and modulations of equivalence ratio, 
respectively, in the generation of entropy waves across acoustically 
compact premixed ﬂames. 

Sattelmayer [117] was the ﬁrst to describe quantitatively the ef- 
fect of entropy wave dispersion resulting from non-uniform mean 
ﬂow on combustor stability. A trapezoidal distribution of convec- 
tive time delays was presumed, which facilitated an analytical for- 
mulation  for  the  corresponding  transfer  function  and  was  inte- 
grated easily in a low-order thermoacoustic model [121] . The dis- 
tribution  of  convective  time  delays  resulting  from  non-uniform 
ﬂow signiﬁcantly reduced the gain of the corresponding transfer 
function, c.f. Figs 6 and 17 (a). It was concluded that “aerodynamic 
dispersion” in the combustor is strong even in the low-frequency 
domain,  and  that  inclusion  of  entropy  waves  in  thermoacoustic

“Direct combustion noise” results from broad-band ﬂuctuations of the overall 
heat release rate of a turbulent ﬂame. Note that acceleration of vorticity waves may 
also generate noise, but this mechanism of ﬂow-acoustic interaction is generally 
considered to be of minor importance in combustion applications.

geneity in turbulent duct ﬂow with non-uniform mean ﬂow proﬁle. The various 
mechanisms are shown schematically at three different axial positions in the duct, 
but note that all mechanisms are active in parallel everywhere along the duct (from 
Wassmer [92] ). 

analysis of gas turbine combustors is not mandatory. Similar con- 
clusion were reached by Eckstein and Sattelmayer [243] in an in- 
vestigation  of  the  inﬂuence  of  entropy  waves  on  a  staged  rich- 
quench-lean, liquid fuel combustor with air-blast atomization 9 . 

A  more  recent  study  by  Goh  and  Morgans  [245] ,  which  em- 
ployed a low-order, wave-based model similar to the formulations 
employed in [117,121] , conﬁrmed some of the earlier results, e.g., 
the possibility that the contribution of entropy waves to thermoa- 
coustic interactions may have a stabilizing effect on a combustor 
with a choked exit. Furthermore, novel phenomena such as mode 
switching and instability without heat release resonance related to 
entropy waves were observed. However, although the sub-model 
for  dissipation  and  dispersion  of  entropy  waves  corresponds  in 
essence to that of Sattelmayer [117] , it was concluded that despite 
these effects, which diminish the strength of entropy waves, sound 
generation from accelerated entropy spots plays a signiﬁcant role 
in thermoacoustic instability. 

Subsequent work by Morgans and co-workers [129,246] concen- 
trates  on  the  effect  of  advection  by  mean  ﬂow  on  the  strength 
of entropy waves and coins the term “shear dispersion” for this 
phenomenon.  In  [129]  advection  of  entropy  inhomogeneities  in 
fully developed turbulent channel-ﬂow is simulated with CFD. Dis- 
sipation  of  entropy  waves  is  found  negligible,  reduction  of  en- 
tropy wave strength is caused predominantly by shear dispersion. 
A follow-up study [246] investigates dissipation and dispersion of 
entropy waves in a combustor ﬂow ﬁeld that includes large-scale, 
unsteady ﬂow features such as swirl with central vortex core, ﬂow 
separation and recirculation, and turbulent ﬂuctuations resolved in 
the LES approach employed, see Fig. 25 . It was found that the un- 
steady ﬂow features contribute very signiﬁcantly to entropy disper- 
sion, and hence to attenuation of entropy wave strength at com- 
bustor exit. In both studies [129,246] the impulse and frequency 
responses of entropy waves at the combustor exit were well de- 
scribed by Gaussian time delay distributions. It was concluded that 
entropy-generated acoustic waves are likely to be important in gas 
turbine combustors despite signiﬁcant shear dispersion. 

Because of the inherent diﬃculty of accurately measuring the 
burned  gas  temperature  with  suﬃcient  temporal  resolution,  ex- 
perimental  data  on  entropy  waves  are  scarce  [238] .  Wassmer 
et al. [92,110] generate entropy waves in a combustion test rig by 
forced  periodic  fuel  injection  and  employ  a  sophisticated  acous- 
tic measurement technique based on the “time of ﬂight” of acous- 
tic signals across temperature inhomogeneities in order to quan- 
tify diffusion and dispersion of entropy waves. The transfer func- 
tion  between  equivalence  ratio  and  entropy  ﬂuctuations  at  the 
ﬂame  is  modeled  by  a  linearized  reactor  model,  the  strength 
of  entropy  waves  at  downstream  locations  is  described  with  a 
convection-diffusion model, see Eq.  (40) for the impulse response 
and Eq.  (42) for the corresponding transfer function F CD . An ef-

Incidentally, intrinsic thermoacoustic (ITA) feedback was recently identiﬁed as 

the root cause of low-frequency, “bulk-mode” oscillations in this test rig [244]

fective Peclet is introduced to represent in an approximate manner 
the overall effects of aerodynamic dispersion (a.k.a. shear disper- 
sion) as well as turbulent and molecular diffusion on the transfer 
function of entropy waves, see Fig. 25 . Experiments with various 
ﬂow velocities and excitation frequencies allowed validation of the 
model over a wide range of parameters. Unfortunately, signiﬁcant 
discrepancies were observed, which require further investigation. 

Giusti  et  al.  [247,248]  investigate  the  propagation  of  entropy 
waves  in  a  small  scale  “entropy  rig”,  where  entropy  waves  are 
generated  by  modulating  the  fuel  ﬂow  rate.  Experimental  data 
are  complemented  by  large-eddy  simulations  of  turbulent,  non- 
reacting duct ﬂow, where entropy inhomogeneities are introduced 
at  the  upstream  boundary  condition.  The  entropy  transfer  func- 
tions  obtained  demonstrate  that  the  decrease  in  entropy  wave

strength with distance scales with a Strouhal number St = f z/U 
A theoretical model for the entropy transfer function suitable for 
inclusion in low-order thermoacoustic models is proposed. The for- 
mulation  requires  knowledge  of  the  mean  velocity  proﬁle.  Com- 
parison  against  the  formulations  of  Sattelmayer  [117]  and  Mor- 
gans  et  al.  [129,246]  with  presumed  trapezoidal  and  Gaussian 
time delay distributions, respectively, and numerical as well as ex- 
perimental  results  demonstrate  the  capability  of  the  new  model 
to  represent  the  development  of  magnitude  and  phase  of  the 
entropy  transfer  function  with  distance  from  the  ﬂame.  At  low 
Strouhal  numbers,  the  contribution  of  shear  dispersion  is  domi- 
nant; whereas for high values of the Strouhal number, turbulent 
mixing and diffusion are also important. A simpliﬁed model based 
solely on the Strouhal number is also proposed, which should be 
useful in cases where the mean velocity proﬁle is not accurately 
known. 

Steinbacher et al. [109] develop and compare a range of models 
of increasing complexity that describe generation and propagation 
of entropy waves in a laminar premixed ﬂame. In accordance with 
earlier  studies  [29,92,110,121,136,237]  the  generation of tempera- 
ture  inhomogeneities  is  considered  to  result  from  perturbations 
of upstream premixture equivalence ratio. For this process, a fast- 
reaction-zone model is proposed, which takes into account varia- 
tions of the speciﬁc heat capacity with equivalence ratio in order 
to evaluate the resulting entropy wave strength with quantitative 
accuracy. Subsequent convection and advection of temperature in- 
homogeneities are described by semi-analytical, low-order formu- 
lations based on single and multiple stream lines, respectively. Fur- 
thermore, a state-space formulation, which is constructed by Finite 
Element discretization of the transport equation for mixture frac- 
tion is developed. Impulse and frequency responses are evaluated 
with these models for several values of diffusion coeﬃcient and 
Peclet number and compared against high-ﬁdelity simulation of a 
laminar premixed ﬂame. Good agreement of the multiple stream 
line model and the state-space model with CFD results is observed. 
As expected, increased dispersion of entropy waves results in more 
pronounced low-pass behavior of the corresponding transfer func- 
tion. 

In closing this section, it is remarked that the majority of mod- 
els on propagation and dispersion of entropy waves are conceptu- 
ally similar, even equivalent to models for convective transport of 
equivalence ratio ﬂuctuations reviewed in Sections 5.1 and 6.2 . This 
should  not  come  as  a  surprise—after  all,  perturbations  in  equiv- 
alence ratio and entropy are both transported convectively. How- 
ever,  it  is  not  readily  comprehensible  why  many  studies  on  en- 
tropy waves do not fully exploit the insight and utilize the meth- 
ods found in the literature on transport and dispersion of pertur-

Note that Giusti et al. speak of Helmholtz number in their papers—although this 
term is reserved for acoustic waves. Considering that entropy waves are convective 
waves and in accordance with the deﬁnitions (35) and (36) we refer to this dimen- 
sionless group as Strouhal number .

mayer [117] and Steinbacher et al. [109] , who treat both phenom- 
ena on an equal footing. 

7. Conclusions and outlook 

This review has focused on studies that describe the unsteady 
response  of  premixed  ﬂames  to  acoustic  or  ﬂow  perturbations 
from  a  time-domain  perspective.  In  this  framework—the  math- 
ematical  background  of  which  has  been  summarized  in  one  of 
the ﬁrst sections—the linear dynamics of a ﬂame is characterized 
completely  by  its  impulse  response  h .  The  ﬂame  transfer  func- 
tion  F (ω)  is  then  computed  as  the  z -transform  of  the  impulse 
response. In the context of stability analysis, it is important that 
in  this  manner  the  transfer  function  can  be  evaluated  also  at 
complex-valued frequencies ω, such that growth rates of thermoa- 
coustic eigenmodes may be computed [9,50] . 

We have demonstrated by expository examples and by analyt- 
ical models based on the G -equation [93,96,98,106,111] that char- 
acteristic features of the frequency resonse of premix ﬂames—such 
as overall low-pass behaviour, excess gain | F | > 1 at certain fre- 
quencies, or local minima in gain coinciding with rapid changes in 
phase of F at other frequencies—may be reproduced quite naturally 
by distributed delays. The delays may often be associated with the 
convective transport of ﬂow or ﬂame perturbations, and it is hoped 
that after perusal of this paper the reader will agree that these fea- 
tures and effects are most conveniently described or explained in 
terms of the impulse response. 

The  time-domain  perspective  makes  it  easy  to  identify  rele- 
vant time scales. More than that, several publications discussed in 
this review have exploited the concept of distributed delays in or- 
der to construct ”gray-box” models of ﬂame dynamics, which are 
parametrized in terms of a small number of variables that describe 
the strength and temporal distribution of delayed responses, see 
e.g.  [13–15,17,63,116,117] . A variety of ﬂow-ﬂame interaction mech- 
anisms may be described in this fashion: the kinematic response 
of the ﬂame front to velocity perturbation, the response to iner- 
tial waves generated at a swirler, or the response to modulations 
of equivalence ratio. Input for such “gray-box” models may come 
from experiment or CFD analysis of (turbulent) reacting ﬂows. Note 
that  until  now  no  attempts  have  been  reported  to  represent  in 
detail the dynamics of liquid-fueled spray ﬂames in terms of dis- 
tributed delays, with the processes of droplet formation, transport, 
evaporation and eventually combustion represented by respective 
impulse response functions. This should be a worthwhile endeavor 
to better understand the complex dynamics of the response of a 
spray ﬂame to acoustic perturbation. 

CFD combined with system identiﬁcation—a form of supervised 
machine learning— also allows to estimate the impulse response 
of a ﬂame as a “black-box” model, i.e. without any assumptions on 
the functional form of the response  [50,178,191,192,194] . Advanced 
system identiﬁcation provides information on the reliability of its 
result in terms of conﬁdence intervals, and can generate models 
for combustion noise [185] . Please note that this review concen- 
trates on results obtained with CFD/SI. Details of implementation 
and utilization of the method are found elsewhere [178–181] . 

This review also presented a number of papers that utilize dis- 
tributed delays to conceptualize and implement means of passive 
control of combustion instabilities [29,30,117,125,127,227,231,232] . 

There  are  limits  to  the  range  of  validity  and  applicability  of 
DTD  models.  The  most  important  limitation  is  that  of  linearity. 
Heuristic extensions of the approach to the nonlinear regime that 
rely on an amplitude dependent impulse response have been pro- 
posed  [87,148] .  It  might  be  rewarding  to  develop  more  funda- 
mental,  fully  nonlinear  approaches  that  rely,  e.g.,  on  higher  or- 
der transfer functions [86] . Furthermore, there are aspects of ﬂame 

W. Polifke / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 79 (2020) 100845 

33 

dynamics that exhibit auto-regressive characteristics, in particular 
the generation of convective perturbations of vorticity upstream of 
the  ﬂame  front  due  to  ﬂame-ﬂow  feedback  [71,72,103–105] .  The 
impulse  response  fully  characterizes  the  linear  dynamics  also  of 
auto-regressive systems, but it may be an ineﬃcient description: 
auto-regressive  behavior  implies  feedback  between  previous  and 
present  output  values,  and  results  often  in  oscillatory  behavior 
with  long  settling  times.  In  such  a  situation,  the  corresponding 
impulse  responses  will  have  many  non-zero  coeﬃcients.  As  re- 
marked above, it might be preferable to describe ﬂame dynamics 
in difference form as a weighted sum of present and previous in- 
puts  and  outputs  [10,192] .  Due  to  intrinsic  thermoacoustic  feed- 
back [190,249] , the coeﬃcients of acoustic transfer and scattering 
matrices may also exhibit auto-regressive characteristics. Again, in 
such cases corresponding model structures such as ARX or Output- 
Error might be more appropriate than the FIR structure implied by 
distributed time delays [10,48,184,210] . 

The discussion has concentrated on the description of ﬂame dy- 
namics in terms of distributed time delays. When combined with 
models for acoustic wave propagation, one obtains a thermoacous- 
tic system model, which is—mathematically speaking—a system of 
differential equations with distributed delays. Methods to conduct 
linear thermoacoustic stability analysis have not been discussed in 
any detail in the present review, instead we merely state summar- 
ily that the integration of distributed time delay models of ﬂame 
dynamics into thermoacoustic system models (in the time as well 
as in the frequency domain) presents no essential diﬃculties and 
refer  to  [9,13,42,58,190,250] .  Schmid  et  al.  [9]  and  Subramanian 
et al. [42] describe a variety of methods to conduct linear stability 
analysis for delay differential equations and compare single time 
delay  vs.  distributed  time  delay  models  of  ﬂame  dynamics.  It  is 
found that a single time delay model is in general not capable of 
capturing the transient dynamics of a thermoacoustic system and 
can yield correct stability predictions only if the unstable eigenfre- 
quency of the system is known a priori with reasonable accuracy. 
Analysis of experimental results will proﬁt from the concepts 
and methods discussed in this review. The determination of rel- 
evant  length  and  time  scales  from  the  distribution  of  time  de- 
lays will support the identiﬁcation of the important mechanisms 
and  their  interactions.  This  in  turn  should  support  the  develop- 
ment of scaling rules, which are important to predict changes in 
ﬂame dynamics with changes in fuel composition, or pressure, or 
mass ﬂow rates. Recent examples of such analysis was presented 
by Æsoy et al. [251] and Nygår and Worth [252] . In these stud- 
ies, DTD models parametrized in terms of several n - τ - σ -models 
are used to represent transfer functions of lean premixed H2/CH4 
ﬂames and swirl ﬂames, respectively. 

In recent years, quantiﬁcation of uncertainties has enjoyed in- 
creased interest also in combustion dynamics [253–255] . This is no 
surprise, given the large sensitivity of thermoacoustic stability to 
changes in operating conditions or burner geometry [6] . The epis- 
temic uncertainty that results from the stochastic nature of sys- 
tem  identiﬁcation  can  be  quantiﬁed  with  regression  analysis,  as 
discussed above. However, comprehensive uncertainty quantiﬁca- 
tion  that  takes  into  account  both  aleatoric  and  epistemic  uncer- 
tainties as they result from boundary conditions, model parameters 
and system identiﬁcation has not yet been carried out. A strategy 
that relies on Gaussian Process modeling and a DTD model for the 
ﬂame dynamics parametrized in terms of n - τ - σ has been proposed 
by Guo et al. [187] .

Wolfgang Polifke studied physics at the University of Re- 
gensburg, the University of Colorado in Boulder and the 
City University of New York (1981-87). He received his 
doctoral  degree from  the  City  University  of  New  York 
(1990). His doctoral thesis dealt with the helicity of tur- 
bulent ﬂows. After that, he spent almost ten years at ABB 
Corporate Research Center in Baden-Dättwil, Switzerland 
working on fundamental aspects of combustion technol- 
ogy.  In  1999,  Prof.  Polifke  was  appointed  professor  at 
TUM.  His  main  research  interests  are  thermo-acoustic 
(combustion) instabilities, aeroacoustics as well as mixing 
and reaction in turbulent ﬂows.
