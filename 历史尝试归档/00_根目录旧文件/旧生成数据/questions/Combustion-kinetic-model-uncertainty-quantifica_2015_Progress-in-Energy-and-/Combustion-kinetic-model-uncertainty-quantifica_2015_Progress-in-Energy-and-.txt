The current interest in the combustion chemistry of hydrocarbon fuels, including the various alcohol and
biodiesel compounds, motivates this review of the methods and application of kinetic uncertainty
quantification (UQ). Our intent is to provide a self-contained review about the mathematical principles
and methods of uncertainty quantification and their application in highly complex, multi-parameter
combustion chemistry problems. We begin by outlining the reasons why the kinetic uncertainty must
be considered and treated as a part of the combustion chemistry development in order to make progress.
This is followed by a brief discussion about the sources and classification of kinetic uncertainties and the
meanings and definitions of model verification and validation. We discuss the histories of UQ studies
with an emphasis on how the combustion community has a long tradition of UQ consideration through
standard sensitivity analysis. Such efforts have motivated the advancements of UQ methods specifically
tailored to combustion chemistry. They also led to the recent growing interests in applying UQ methods
as a part of our recommended long-term solution to the chemical kinetic problem of combustion. We
then review and classify the various UQ methods and illustrate their applications for problems involving
forward uncertainty quantification and propagation, and as an inverse problem leading to model un-
certainty constraining. For the inverse problem, the focus of discussion is in the use of methods origi-
nating from Bayes' Theorem. We show that, for combustion chemistry problems, while UQ alone cannot
produce precise, individual rate parameters, it can be instrumental in measuring the progress of our
understanding of combustion chemistry and in utilizing fundamental combustion property data beyond
a simple “agreeedisagree” statement. When treated as a Bayesian inference problem, UQ also aids the
development of predictive kinetic models in two ways: the use of fundamental combustion property
data, global or local, to provide a better constrained kinetic model, and along with forward kinetic un-
certainty propagation, to yield estimates for the confidence of a model to make predictions outside of the
thermodynamic regimes where the model has been tested. We provide several examples to illustrate the
utility of the UQ methods discussed and to demonstrate that, in the field of combustion chemistry,
further progress will be better achieved through a combination of fundamental studies of reaction rates
through well-defined and designed experiments and ab initio theoretical calculations, and of analyses of
global experimental measurements. These studies together must be supplemented by UQ analyses, in
such a way that a measurable progress can be made over time.

1. Introduction

“Remember that all models are wrong; the practical question is
how wrong do they have to be to not be useful.” [1]

G. E. P. Box and N. R. Draper (1987)

In complex problems many aspects of the system are not exactly
known and may never be known exactly. Coupled with the high
nonlinearity and dimensionality, one must ask how it can be
possible to use models of such systems to explore the intricate
nature of a phenomenon and make useful predictions. The
approach to developing detailed kinetic models (mechanisms) of
fuel combustion involves compiling a set of elementary reactions
whose rate parameters may be determined from individual rate
measurements, reaction-rate theory, or a combination of both. For
large hydrocarbon fuels, many of the reaction pathways and rates
must be based on extrapolation of knowledge of smaller-species
the
reactions. These methods have uncertainties. Whether

collective uncertainties can be small enough to meet a certain
chemical accuracy and to satisfy a particular combustion simulation
continues to be an open question. Of course, model uncertainties
may also be the result of incomplete physics and missing reaction
pathways. It has been shown and will be reiterated in this review
article, that even if the reaction model is complete, the underlying
rate-coefficient uncertainty generally precludes the possibility of
predicting relevant combustion properties of a fuel a priori [2].

Let us consider the rate coefficient of the quintessential reaction

of combustion.

H þ O2 4 O þ OH,

(R1)

with rate constant k1. According to the NIST chemical kinetics
database [3], k1 has been examined in at least 77 independent
experimental studies in the forward or reverse directions. The rate
expressions have been reviewed and evaluated at least 31 times. A
historical view of the uncertainty in k1, depicted in Fig. 1,
is
revealing both in terms of the past achievements and future

uncertain by as much as a factor of 2. Of course, not every rate
coefficient needs to have an uncertainty as small as 15%. The un-
certainty in the simulation results usually comes from the uncer-
tainty in the rate parameters of just a handful number of reactions.
As will be discussed in further details in Section 3, both observa-
tions underscore the key obstacles to combustion chemistry
model development and the need for a proper consideration of
model uncertainty, both now and the future.

Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is the science for quantification
and minimization of uncertainties with computer experiments and
simulation [17,18]. It combines physical observations of the system,
computational models, and expert opinions to make predictions
about the system and, equally importantly, to determine the con-
fidence of these predictions. As a mathematical science, UQ is
rooted deeply in statistical mathematics. UQ methods, such as the
Bayesian uncertainty approach [19], provide statistical alternatives
to deterministic numerical integration.

One typical example in which UQ is essential is weather fore-
casting. Uncertainty is a fundamental property of weather and
seasonal climate predictions. Today, no forecast
is complete
without a description of its uncertainty [20]. In other words, for
such a complex phenomenon, we are forced to make only
approximate yet still useful predictions because of
the un-
certainties intrinsic to the model and its numerical solutions.
Although it is not the authors' view that the problem of weather
forecasting is identical to combustion in nature, they do share
similarities: weather-related prediction uncertainties stem from
limitation in our knowledge about the physical processes, while
others come from uncertainties in the parameters of the model and
the experiments with which we “calibrate” the model, a situation
not entirely different from combustion chemistry.

Indeed, one of the key challenges of combustion chemistry lies
in the handling and reduction of uncertainties in the reaction
pathways and their rate parameters and of an efficient approach to
assess the impact of these uncertainties in our ability to predict a
combustion phenomenon. This review paper highlights recent
advances about UQ applications in combustion chemistry analysis.
It also outlines the challenges in future progresses in combustion
chemistry in the context of uncertainty quantification.

1.1. Historical perspective of kinetic model development: methods
and practices

Combustion chemistry through numerical detailed kinetic
modeling started from the work of DixoneLewis some fifty years
ago [21], though studies that used the principles of elementary
reaction mechanisms and kinetics to understand the chemistry of
pyrolysis, oxidation and combustion started much earlier (e.g., Refs.
[22e25]). Since then, many kinetic models for the combustion of
hydrocarbon fuels have been proposed (see, e.g., Refs. [26e90] for
work published prior to 2000). The triumph and progress over that
period of time have been reviewed from different perspectives (see,
e.g., Refs. [91e93]). The success of the earlier work has encouraged
a wide range of studies in more recent years into the combustion
liquid hydrocarbon fuels
chemistry of large-molecular weight,
[94e98]. Meanwhile, the community also realized the need to
revisit the foundational part of the combustion chemistry from
time to time as new, more accurate understanding emerges. Ex-
amples include the recent efforts in the H2/CO reaction mechanism
(e.g., Refs. [12,99e111]). Such effort has also manifested in persis-
tent efforts to update rate coefficients through comprehensive
evaluations [7,8,10,112e118].

A feature common to past efforts is the lack of quantitative
measure of the uncertainties underlying a kinetic model. A feature
parallel to this problem is the “many-model” problem, or model

challenges. The tremendous advances in laser diagnostics and
shock tube techniques in the late 1980s and early 1990s [14]
brought significant improvement in the accuracy of k1. Today, the
best experiments give a two-standard deviation uncertainty in k1
better than 15% over the temperature range of 1100 Ke3370 K [12].
Among elementary reactions of combustion relevance, this preci-
sion is by far the highest achieved. It is truly an astonishing
achievement considering that k1 itself spans two orders of magni-
tude over that temperature range. Yet, such precision may still not
be enough for combustion simulations. For example, if a particular
combustion response has a logarithmic sensitivity coefficient (see,
Section 1.2 for definition) of 0.2 with respect to k1da value typical
for the laminar flame speeddthe uncertainty of k1 causes the
predicted combustion response to be uncertain by ±3% due to this
uncertainty alone. The rate coefficients of other reactions are, in
general, less certain than is k1, even though they generally do not
impact the combustion prediction as much as k1.

As a further example, Fig. 2 illustrates a model problem of
ethylene oxidation in a perfectly stirred reactor at a pressure of
30 bar and a constant-temperature of 1200 K, and in particular,
the prediction uncertainties exhibited with a representative re-
action kinetic model [16]. The figure presents a Monte Carlo
sampling of the uncertainties of the rate coefficients of the re-
actions considered in the model and their impact on the concen-
trations of OH, H2, H2O, CO and CO2 as a function of the mean
residence time. Figures in the left panel show the results obtained
using uncertainty factors currently known for each reaction,
whose values range from 1.15 for k1, 1.2 to 2 for 8% of the reactions,
2 and 3 each for one third of the reactions, and 5 to 10 for the
remaining 20% of the reactions. The right panel of Fig. 2 shows the
corresponding uncertainty assuming all rate coefficients to be
hypothetically accurate to within 15%. Two observations can be
made from these plots. First, the current uncertainties are still too
large for the model to be predictive. For example, in the hysteresis
region, the combined uncertainty in the rate parameters produce a
prediction uncertainty of more than an order of magnitude in
residence time and two orders of magnitude in concentration.
Second, even if all rate parameters could be determined to within
15% uncertainty and all reaction pathways were accounted for, the
uncertainty of the model prediction is still not negligible. As
shown in the figure, the extinction and ignition times can be still

proliferation [119]. In fact, these “many” models can be viewed as
statistical sampling of the underlying parameter uncertainty.
Consider some of the reaction models of H2 oxidation published
prior to a comprehensive set of laminar burning rates of hydrogen
at high pressures being made available [106]. The reaction models
considered here [100,101,103e105,120] share the same set of re-
actions and were all “calibrated” in one way or another against the
laminar flame speed of hydrogen-air mixtures at atmospheric
pressure. They differ only in the choices of rate coefficients. When
compared to the laminar mass burning rate of hydrogen in an
oxygenehelium mixture, however, Burke et al. [106,121] noted the
predictions of available reaction models diverge towards elevated
pressure. As shown in Fig. 3, the predictions of these models, in fact,
lie within the uncertainty band predicted for an arbitrary, nominal
model (e.g., the trial model of Davis et al. [101]). Hence, the

differences in the prediction do not imply any missing physics.
Rather, they are the result of rate parameter uncertainties whose
impact is amplified towards high pressures. While the problem just
mentioned is entirely expected, it is also troublesome that a user is
often left with the dilemma as to what model to choose, and un-
fortunately the ultimate selection is often made on an ad hoc basis,
because the criterion for choosing a model suitable for a particular
application is unavailable.

Development of chemical kinetic models of combustion is not a
linear process of reaction pathway and rates postulation followed
by a treatment of a mathematical inverse problem. It is very clear
that, during the early stage of kinetic mechanism studies, the un-
derlying complexity requires the problem to be tackled piecewise
under a degree of chemical isolation. Two important advances have
become instrumental to combustion chemistry research: the use of

This situation is exemplified by the discussion made earlier for the
mass burning rate of hydrogen. Under this condition, a predictive
model can be represented at best by a collection of regimes on an
acceptable, hyper uncertainty surface on which every point (or rate
parameter combination) gives statistically acceptable predictions
for a prescribed set of combustion data. The feasible set, a term
from optimization theory recently introduced to the combustion
field, defines this rate parameter set [132]. In this context the many
competing reaction models in the literature may be viewed as
points distributed in the kinetic uncertainty space, some of which
lie on the acceptable uncertainty surface, and others that may not
be on this surface. A rational goal for developing a predictive re-
action model cannot be the identification of a single point (equiv-
alent to a given reaction model), for such a point can be only as
arbitrary as any of an infinite number of other points on the
acceptable kinetic hyper surface. Rather, the further progress of
combustion reaction kinetics must be defined as a progressive
reduction of the size of the uncertainty surface using theoretical
and experimental tools current available or to be developed in the
future.

1.2. Sensitivity analysis and uncertainty quantification in
combustion kinetics

A widely used method to understand how the solution of a
chemical kinetic model is dependent on the model parameters, and
notably the reaction rate coefficients,
is sensitivity analysis
[17,35,51,133e135]. A first-order local sensitivity analysis calculates
the derivative of a model response with respect to model param-
eters. Higher-order sensitivity determines the joint impact of two
or more parameters on a model prediction. As a diagnostic tool,
sensitivity analysis is used to uncover those reactions that have the
greatest influence on a global combustion property or a local
property, e.g., what reactions impact the concentration of a species
or temperature. The various sensitivity methods and their re-
lationships to UQ have been discussed in great detail in a review
paper by Tur(cid:1)anyi [133]. UQ is closely related to sensitivity analysis,
and in many ways UQ is a natural extension of sensitivity analysis.
For example, as first used by Warnatz [136] and further discussed
by Tur(cid:1)anyi et al. [137], the product of the first-order sensitivity
coefficient and the uncertainty in the rate coefficient measures of
the influence of the uncertainty in an individual rate parameter on
the uncertainty in a kinetic model prediction.

One of the commonly used sensitivity measures is the loga-
rithmic sensitivity coefficient. As discussed by Gardiner [138], the
sensitivity coefficient of the ith computed quantity or model pre-
diction yi with respect to the jth rate parameter xj is

As an invaluable tool, the concept of sensitivity analysis was
introduced in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Beyond the brute
force method, several numerically efficient methods were intro-
duced [35,139e156]. Shuler and coworkers [140e144] championed
the method of Fourier amplitude analysis for multiparameter

uncertainty. Symbols: experimental data [106] with the error bars indicate 2s uncer-
tainty of the data. The shaded-area and the dashed lines bracketing the shaded area are
the probability distribution and 2s uncertainty of the reaction model, respectively.
Reaction models used for the simulations are O'Connaire et al. [100], and Davis et al.

electronic structure calculations and reaction rate theories
[92,122e124], and advances in laser diagnostics coupled with the
shock tube technique [14]. Attempts were also made at addressing
the comprehensiveness of a reaction model in terms of the range of
thermodynamic state the model covers and the range of combus-
tion phenomena it describes [125].

Given the advances just discussed, one has to ask whether it is
possible to rely entirely on first-principles approaches combined
with validation against highly accurate experiments to obtain a
predictive kinetic model of fuel combustion. Currently, the best
demonstrated uncertainty of shock tube experiments is around 15%
for rate coefficients at high temperatures [12]. Ab initio theories
(e.g., the coupled cluster CCSD(T) method) target a chemical ac-
curacy of ±1 kcal/mol for species thermochemistry and reaction
energy barriers (see, e.g., Refs. [126,127]). This accuracy gives an
expected uncertainty factor value of 1.65, 1.4 and 1.3 in the rate
coefficient at 1000 K, 1500 K and 2000 K, respectively. Combined
with the inaccuracies in the vibrational frequencies and the treat-
internal rotations using transition state theory or
ment of

equation
modeling (see, e.g., Ref. [122,124,128]), we expect that the total
uncertainty in rate predictions to be no better than 50% above
1000 K (see Refs. [129e131] for some recent examples). As was
shown in Fig. 2, even if the rate coefficients are all known to within
15%, the uncertainty in predictions of many practical combustion
phenomena still can be considerable. In summary, model con-
struction using ab initio theories and/or well-designed experiments
allowing for submodel isolation can make notable progress, but by
themselves will not be enough to achieve truly predictive
modeling.

theory/master

In fact, a complete reaction model, for which each and every rate
parameter is sufficiently chemically accurate, will probably never
exist. There are two fundamental reasons that support this notion.
First, the completeness of a kinetic model cannot be determined a
priori. Then, the relevant question to ask is whether the kinetic
model can describe known physical observations. Second, even for
simple models like that of H2/CO combustion, the kinetic un-
certainties and the dimensionality of the uncertainty space are too
large to “pin” the model to a unique point in the uncertainty space.

model systems. Rabitz and coworkers [145e147]
introduced
Green's function method of sensitivity analysis in chemical kinetics.
The “Direct Method” by Dickinson and Gelinas [148] introduces the
use of Jacobian of the model problem in sensitivity calculation. The
commonly used method today was originally proposed by Stewart
and Sorenson [139], which fits naturally into the solution methods
used for problems frequently encountered in combustion chemis-
try and which works well for both time-independent and time-
dependent problems. More importantly, the method was imple-
mented in the CHEMKIN suite of codes [157], which has been the
mainstream code for combustion chemistry analysis over the last
thirty years. The reader is referred to the review paper of Miller
et al. [51] for further details.

Consider a general dynamical system X in vector notation,

Xðs; t; y; xÞ 1⁄4 Lðs; t; y; xÞ (cid:2) f ðs; t; xÞ 1⁄4 0

(3)

where t is the time, L represents the conservations of various fluid
mechanical and thermodynamic properties and of species mass
fractions, y 1⁄4 y(s,t;x) is the solution vector of the system or model
response and f 1⁄4 f(s,t;x) is the source term, both of which depend
on the position s and time t, and are parametrically dependent on
the parameters x, which can be uncertain. Here the source term f is
basically a chemical kinetic model applied to a specific problem
that is governed by X. In combustion chemistry, Eq. (3) can be a set
of conservation equations of a flame, or a set of rate equations
describing the time evolution of species and thermodynamic
quantities. By the chain rule, we have

stationary system may be conveniently calculated as

Analysis of the first-order sensitivity coefficients, whether they
are obtained from brute force calculation or from Eq. (5), quickly

yielded some very useful understanding of combustion chemistry.
For example, as Fig. 4 shows, the number of reaction rate co-
efficients that impact a combustion response is usually very few
compared to the total number of reactions considered in a kinetic
model; the ranked sensitivity coefficients form the basis for the
selection of active rate parameters for model uncertainty minimi-
zation, as will be discussed later. Although it is not used frequently,
higher-order sensitivity has been discussed [147,158]. In particular,
the second-order sensitivity coefficients indicate the importance of
parameter coupling, which can be crucial to kinetic model refine-
ment [57].

Among the pioneering work of uncertainty-related analysis in
combustion chemistry, the most influential work has been that of
Michael Frenklach, who was the first to systematically treat kinetic
parameter uncertainties [2,17,35,37,159]. In his studies of system-
atic optimization of detailed kinetic models [17,159], Frenklach
addressed the fundamental issue concerning the role of underlying
parameter uncertainty in kinetic modeling and asked whether it is
“possible to adjust a large-scale dynamic model in a systematic
manner with a reasonable amount of effort.” In order to address
this question, the method of solution mapping was introduced as a
quantitative way to express model predictions as functions of rate
parameters; a response surface is generated which contains the
first- and second-order sensitivity information explicitly. The role
of fundamental combustion experiments was reinterpreted as not
only to serve as a measure for comparison with model predictions,
but also to provide statistically meaningful information that is used
for constraining the joint parameter uncertainty in a kinetic model.
It is this reinterpretation that allows for systematic development of
the model through multi-parameter optimization against experi-
mental data. Finally, the concept of non-uniqueness of parameter
choices, or the feasible region, was introduced. The last point lays
the foundation for what is a renewed concept of the feasible
parameter set in his later publications [119,132].

The aforementioned studies form the theoretical and practical
foundations for the much-celebrated GRI-Mech effort of the 1990s
[160e162]da successful drive of the systematic treatment of ki-
netic parameter uncertainty through collaborative and coordinated
modeling and experimentation, from fundamental rate parameter
evaluation, reaction rate theory application,
initial trial model
testing, to designing experiments for measurements of key rate

parameters and critical combustion properties, and model opti-
mization and interactive dissemination. It also inspired a large
range of UQ research that has been conducted over the last decade.
An early effort that bridges the UQ analysis of chemical kinetics
to sensitivity analysis is the work of Tam(cid:1)as Tur(cid:1)anyi. In his 1990
review article, Tur(cid:1)anyi [133] discussed the various sensitivity
methods available at that time, but the real significance of the
article is about extending sensitivity analysis to quantitative un-
certainty analysis, coupled kinetic parameter estimation, experi-
mental design, and mechanism reduction.

McRae and coworkers [163] championed the method of Deter-
ministic Equivalent Modeling Method (DEMM) to represent the
stochastic distribution of kinetic model outputs. The method relies
on a representation of parametric uncertainty via polynomial chaos
expansions, and utilizes orthogonal collocation to calculate the
distributions of the model responses. A series of studies by Najm,
Ghenum, and Knio [164e166] further advanced the method of
spectral stochastic uncertainty quantification, and showed that
polynomial chaos methods and conventional sensitivity analysis
provide similar first-order information, but polynomial chaos
provide better higher-order information critical to uncertainty
quantification [166]. In particular, confidence intervals on sensi-
tivity coefficients, which can be uncertain themselves, may be
calculated.

In a recent paper by Frenklach [119], the role of uncertainty
analysis and reduction has been discussed in a larger context of
model development through Process Informatics Model (PrIMe). A
quite comprehensive discussion of the role and methods of sensi-
tivity and uncertainty analyses in combustion chemistry modeling
may be found in Tomlin [167]. The intent of the current paper is to
provide a self-contained review about the mathematical principles
and methods of uncertainty quantification and their application in
highly complex, multi-parameter combustion chemistry problems.
We intend to provide a comprehensive review and classification for
the various UQ methods and illustrate their applications for prob-
lems involving forward uncertainty quantification and propagation,
and as an inverse problem leading to model uncertainty
constraining.

1.3. Error versus uncertainty in computer modeling

The terms “error” and “uncertainty” have often been used
interchangeably in many different ways. For instance, as discussed
by Raman and co-workers [168], “error” is used in the same sense
as the terms “experimental uncertainty” and “model form error”
defined below, while “uncertainty” means only “parametric un-
certainty.” In this paper, we adopt the following definitions. Un-
certainty refers to deficiencies of an experimental measurement or
model prediction that is caused by the lack of precise knowledge.
Error, on the other hand, is a recognizable, recoverable, determin-
istic deficiency that is not due to lack of knowledge. Examples of
error include a mistyped rate parameter, a mismatch of the ther-
mochemical properties of an isomer due to confusion of species
nomenclature, a wrong value in the initial condition of a simula-
tion, rate constants of an elementary reaction not obeying the
principle of detailed balancing, and a convergence error that can be
resolved by reducing computational error tolerance.

Two sources of uncertainty may exist. They can be categorized
into aleatory and epistemic uncertainties. Aleatory uncertainty is
inherent to a probabilistic process. This uncertainty is irreducible
and must be characterized by a probability distribution. Epistemic
uncertainty is due to limited knowledge: e.g., an incomplete un-
derstanding of the underlying physics (missing pathways), and
imprecise evaluation of a rate constant. Unless otherwise indi-
cated, what we discuss here is the epistemic uncertainty.

1.4. Source of uncertainties

The sources of model uncertainties can be many; and they may
be classified into several categories. Oberkampf and Roy [169]
divide the sources of uncertainty into three major groups, which
are model input uncertainty, model form error, and numerical
uncertainty. Numerical uncertainty comes from procedures for the
solution of a particular physical problem using a given model. In
general, numerical uncertainty can be minimized by careful
convergence tests. For example, it has been long known that as an
eigenvalue problem, the laminar flame speed or the mass burning
rate can be a strong function of the computational domain size and
local gradients. In principle, a properly converged solution requires
sensitivity tests with respect to the domain size and grid refine-
ment parameters. The other two categories can be subdivided
further.

Model input uncertainty refers to uncertainty in the data that is
being used to build the model, that is, the notion that a model will
always have some inherent “fuzziness.” It can be split into
parameter uncertainty and experimental uncertainty. Parameter
uncertainty stems from chemical kinetic rate parameters, ther-
modynamic or transport properties whose exact values are un-
known, cannot be known beyond a certain accuracy, or are only
approximate due to assumptions in the fundamental theory (e.g.,
rigid-rotor, harmonic oscillator treatment of partition functions).
Experimental uncertainty refers to the measurement uncertainty
of fundamental combustion properties that are used to constrain
the model. This uncertainty can be best quantified by careful as-
sessments of similar errors in different apparatus and by repeating
measurements across a range of experimental apparatus in one or
more laboratories.

and

equations.

Model form error refers to uncertainties in the assumptions
inherent in developing the model. It can be split into structural
uncertainty and interpolation and extrapolation uncertainty.
Structural uncertainty is the result of lack of knowledge of the
underlying physics. Examples include missing reaction path-
incomplete reaction description, or ill-formulated con-
ways,
servation
Extrapolation
Interpolation
uncertainty is the result of a lack of available laboratory ex-
periments for a particular set of thermodynamic conditions. The
same category of uncertainty is applicable to elements of re-
action model development that employs the reaction class rule
or analogous reactions. In the context of UQ of chemical ki-
netics,
interpolation and extrapolation uncertainties can be
related to parameter uncertainty. For example, extrapolating
high-temperature shock-tube measurement of a rate coefficient
to low temperatures can lead to tremendously enlarged uncer-
tainty at low temperatures because of the Arrhenius behavior,
and in some cases, simple extrapolation can lead to violation of
the collision theory and structural uncertainties. It is for this
reason that rate coefficient extrapolation are appropriate only
when such an extrapolation are guided, at least to some extent,
by reaction rate theories.

The focus of the current review is on uncertainty quantifi-
cation that results from model input uncertainties, although a
proper treatment of
these uncertainties can lead to useful
conclusion about model form errors. For example, failure for a
chemical reaction model to predict a particular combustion
measurement, within its experimental uncertainty and also
within the uncertainty bounds of the model rate parameters
(and thermodynamic and transport properties), is a suggestion
that the model is deficient beyond parameter uncertainty. The
model perhaps has missing reaction pathways, or incomplete
reaction descriptions, or the accuracy of the experiment is in
question.

1.5. Model verification and validation

Before we start to discuss the various UQ methods for com-
bustion chemistry analysis, we wish to make a brief remark about
what is meant by model validation and verification, as these terms
have been frequently used in the literature. There has been much
discussion about rigorous definitions for these terms. A review is
provided in the book, Verification and Validation in Scientific
Computing by Oberkampf and Roy [169], which we will summarize
here. The first definitions of verification and validation were pro-
vided by the Society for Computer Simulation (SCS) [170], in a short
article providing concise definitions for a number of terms. In this
work, SCS divided modeling and simulation into three key com-
ponents, which were reality, the conceptual model, and the
computerized model. Reality was defined as what you can see and
touch. The conceptual model is the mathematical description of
reality. The computerized model is the executable code that im-
plements the conceptual model.

1.5.1. Verification

Multiple definitions of verification have been used for verifica-
tion in computer modeling, differing in detail but similar in sub-
stance to the definition of the SCS, which is “substantiation that a
computerized model represents a conceptual model within speci-
fied limits of accuracy.” As an example, the American Society for
Mechanical Engineers' Guide for Verification and Validation in
Computational Solid Mechanics divides verification into two com-
ponents. These are code verification, which ensures that the com-
puter code is correctly implemented (i.e., there are no mistakes),
and solution verification, which ensures that the numerical solu-
tion agrees with known solutions to within certain tolerances and
also addresses questions of numerical stability. For instance, in
certain special cases, the conceptual model will admit analytical
solutions, to which solutions of the computerized model must
converge for it to be verified.

1.5.2. Validation

As with verification, model validation has many definitions, all
similar to the SCS's, “substantiation that a computerized model
within its domain of applicability possesses a satisfactory range of
accuracy consistent with the intended application of the model.”
This is divided by Oberkampf and Trucano [171] into three aspects,
which are comparison with experimental data, extrapolation of the
model and associated uncertainty to its intended domain, and
assessing whether the model meets certain precision requirements
in its intended domain. It is the first aspect that is usually meant by
“validation” in the combustion community. As a general practice,
unfortunately, the community usually ignores the second and third
aspects of validation.

Validation includes extrapolation because experimental data
may not be available in the intended domain of the model. This
means that the uncertainty of the model must be estimated over
that domain. If the model is later to be optimized against the
validation data, then the corresponding measurement uncertainty
must also be estimated and propagated. Without an uncertainty
estimate, it can be said that the model is being compared with or
tested against experiment, but it cannot be said to be validated.

An important distinction between verification and validation is
that verification is a well-posed problem with a definite answer. In
the case of code verification, for instance, the computerized model
is being compared with a known (possibly analytical) solution, and
the numerical solution either agrees with the analytical solution or
it does not. Validation, on the other hand, is poorly posed. An
experiment gives an answer, but that answer is subject to in-
terpretations and assumptions. It can never be known whether

those assumptions hold in all cases, and as such the validation data
are not “true” in any more concrete sense than are the predictions
of the model.

2. Uncertainty quantification

2.1. Estimation of rate constant uncertainties

Rate coefficients are evaluated typically for their most probable
values as a function of temperature (and pressure). Such evaluation
is not a necessary starting point or even a component of UQ analysis
though it has been used in almost all kinetic modeling studies. The
uncertainty in the rate coefficient is given typically by the uncer-
tainty factor f. In a symmetric form f may be written as

f ðTÞ 1⁄4

k0ðTÞ
klowerðTÞ

1⁄4

kupperðTÞ
k0ðTÞ

(6)

where k0 is the nominal rate coefficient with its lower and upper
bounds given as klower and kupper, respectively. The expression states
that a rate value outside of the range [k0/f,fk0] is highly improbable.
This description does not express, however, the probability distri-
bution of the rate coefficient uncertainty. Historically, the uncer-
tainty factor is often interpreted as simple bounds of uncertainty;
and the probability distribution of uncertainty is a rectangular
function, as in the GRI-Mech effort [160e162]. In other cases, the
probability distribution of uncertainty is treated as being lognormal
with the uncertainty factor interpreted as the geometric, two
standard deviations. As will be discussed later (Section 2.5), the
choice for the distribution is not as crucial as one would expect
when making forward UQ projections.

The cause for the difficulty in probability distribution assign-
ment is quite simple and can be understood by examining the rate
evaluation process and procedure. In Fig. 5, we show an Arrhenius
plot for the rate coefficient of reaction H þ CH4 / CH3 þ H2,
evaluated by Baulch et al. [118], for which a relatively large number
of experimental data are available. It is seen that the quoted f 1⁄4 2
uncertainty limits brackets most of the available experimental data.
The evaluation rejects some of the low-temperature values, and
this is often the result of a joint consideration of available data and
fundamental reaction rate theories. In other cases, as depicted in
Fig. 6 for H þ HCO / CO þ H2, very limited rate data are available
and they can scatter over a quite wide range. In this case, certain
data or analysis would receive greater weights and the uncertainty
band can lie within a range in which a substantial number of data
points are rejected. It is not straightforward to give a rigorous
description for the probability distribution of the rate uncertainty
and the coupling of the Arrhenius parameters when data are sparse,
as in this case.

A statistical treatment of the Arrhenius rate parameters be-
comes possible when a sufficient amount of data becomes avail-
able. Tur(cid:1)anyi and coworkers [172e174] derived an analytical
expression that describes the temperature dependence of the un-
certainty of k as a function of the elements of the covariance matrix
of the Arrhenius parameters. Such a treatment enables the joint
uncertainty of the Arrhenius parameters to be defined and leads to
a more rigorous representation of the rate coefficient uncertainty.
In their treatment, the logarithm of the rate constant k(T) 1⁄4 ATne(cid:2)E/
(cid:7)
RT is defined as kðTÞ 1⁄4 pTq 1⁄4 1⁄2 a n ε (cid:3)T
, where
kðTÞ 1⁄4 ln kðTÞ, a 1⁄4 ln A and ε 1⁄4 E/R. The uncertainty in kðTÞ is given
by s2
k ðTÞ 1⁄4 qTSpq, where Sp is the covariance among the Arrhenius
parameters. If the uncertainty in the rate coefficient is specified at
enough temperatures, Sp can be estimated by least-squares
regression. As an example, the uncertainty in the Arrhenius A fac-
tor and activation energy for the reaction O þ N2O / 2NO was

calculated and shown in Fig. 7. In this case, sk is specified to be 0.4 at
1000 K, 0.2 at 2000 K, and 0.3 at 4000 K. As can be seen from the
figure, the Arrhenius parameters are tightly correlated. The point of
the work of Nagy and Tur(cid:1)anyi [172] was that reliable estimates of
the uncertainties in rate parameters could be made when a suffi-
cient amount of data are available.

In spite of the aforementioned advance, a proper treatment of
the rate coefficient uncertainty remains challenging. There is a
need for a general protocol to account for statistical representation
of measurement uncertainty, theoretical interpretation of the data,
and expert opinion.

2.2. Representations of model response and uncertainty

A basic objective of UQ is to analyze the uncertainty in the
model response y as a result of model parameters x being un-
certain. In this section, we review the theories and introduce the
various methods that can be used to describe the uncertainty
in y.

2.2.1. The Taylor series

In the simplest case, a model prediction y as a function of x can

be expressed in terms of a Taylor series

where g 1⁄4 Vy is the gradient of y, H 1⁄4 1⁄2J(Vy) is the Hessian and J
is the Jacobian operator, and h.o.t. represents higher order terms.
Note that the model parameters x are normalized here so that,
when x 1⁄4 0 (a null vector), y 1⁄4 y0. The uncertainty in y, sy, is
related to the uncertainty in x. If we consider some set of inde-
pendent, identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables x, we can
express the model parameters as random variables such that
X 1⁄4 x(0) þ x(1)x, where x(0)
is a
transformation matrix such that the covariance matrix is given by
S 1⁄4 xð1ÞT E1⁄2xxT (cid:3)xð1Þ, where E[] is the expectation operator. If the
model parameters have some prescribed uncertainty and are in-
dependent of each other, x(1) is diagonal and xð1Þ

sx,i is the uncertainty in the ith model parameter and Q is a
constant that depends on the probability density function (PDF)

of x. A typical choice is that the members of x are normally
distributed with mean 0 and variance 1, in which case Q is 1 or 1⁄2,
depending on whether sx,i is interpreted as a 1s or a 2s uncer-
tainty, respectively.

A critical question is whether the rate parameters are inde-
pendent, a priori. Usually, their relationship depends on the way
they have been determined. If the rate evaluation comes from an
experimental measurement, usually the rate under consideration
can be correlated, perhaps loosely and depending on how well the
experiment is designed, with some other secondary parameters. In
this case, the correlation is best handled as an inverse uncertainty
problem, which is detailed in Section 3. Alternatively, though, the
rate evaluations might come from rules for analogous reactions. For
instance, in the work of Cai and Pitsch [175] and Prager et al. [176],
all reaction rate constants in a given class, such as H abstraction of
various hydrocarbons by OH, were assumed to be equal to each
other and, therefore, to be perfectly correlated. This assumption
resulted in greater model uncertainty but also in a model with

fewer degrees of freedom. The implications of rate rules and un-
certainties are discussed further in Section 4.1.

Once the PDF of x has been prescribed, sy can be computed by

replacing x of Eq. (7) by X and then taking the variance.

where tr() is the trace of a square matrix. This is the most familiar
representation of uncertainty, and typically the form found in sta-

presented in the left panel of Fig. 8, adapted from Ref. [178]. In this
figure, laminar flame speeds of C2H4/air mixtures at 5 atm and
298 K are presented. Laminar flame speeds were modeled using

USC Mech II [16]. Each A factor was assigned a log-normal distri-
bution about its nominal value. Taylor series terms y0, g, and H were
calculated in increments of 0.2 in equivalence ratio, and the 2sy
uncertainty limits were calculated. The probability density be-
tween those limits was calculated by fitting a normal distribution
with that value of y0 and sy. The uncertainty band was then
determined by fitting a cubic spline to the calculated uncertainty
and probability density.

2.2.2. Polynomial chaos expansion

The polynomial chaos representation was developed by Wiener
[179], originally as a stochastic description of statistical mechanics,

and later extended to various other systems. A brief summary,
following Najm, Ghanem, and coworkers [180], is presented here.
Consider a set of arbitrary basis random variables x. There is then
a set of basis polynomials J(x) that are orthogonal, i.e., E[JiJj] 1⁄4 0
for i s j. For example, if each xi is normally distributed with mean
0 and variance 1, each Jk is a Hermite polynomial. Together, x andJ
form a polynomial chaos (PC) basis. A complete review of various
PC bases was provided by Xiu and Karniadakis [181], showing how
different basis random variables are paired with corresponding
orthogonal polynomials, as described in what follows.

A PC basis is characterized by its dimension Nd and its order No.

The size of the expansion P is given by

In principle, Nd and No, and therefore P, are infinite, but
computational considerations require truncating the expansion at a
suitable level. A model prediction y can be decomposed in terms of
the basis functions.

2.2.3. High-dimensional model representation

The High Dimensional Model Representation (HDMR) was
introduced by Sobol' [183] and first used in chemical kinetics by
Rabitz [184] as a means to more efficiently represent model out-
puts. It argues that a polynomial regression such as the Taylor series
can be inefficient for arbitrary functions of the model parameters.
In HDMR, the model prediction y is expressed as a set of component
functions.

(16)

In this representation, yi is a function of only the single variable xi;
likewise the function yij describes pairwise interactions between
variables xi and xj. This representation differs from the Taylor series in
Eq. (7) in that the form of the functions yi and yij are not specified; they
can be polynomials of arbitrary order, or for that matter, any function.
In this case, h.o.t. represents coupling of three or more variables.

The functions yi and yij can be determined through a method
following Rabitz [184]. If the model prediction y is defined in some
region of the rate parameter space, denoted Kn4Rn, the compo-
nents of the HDMR expansion are given by

(19)

Collectively, the set of spectral mode strengths y is the poly-
nomial chaos expansion (PCE) for y. By the CameroneMartin The-
orem [182], any random variable can be approximated to an
arbitrary precision using a PCE of suitable order and dimension.

The PCE for a random variable y is related to the Taylor series
through the polynomial basis functions. In the case of the Wiener-
Hermite chaos, x are normally distributed with mean 0 and vari-
ance 1, and J are the multidimensional Hermite polynomials Hn(x).
The first few such functions are H0(x) 1⁄4 1, H1(x) 1⁄4 x, and
H2(x) 1⁄4 x2(cid:2)1, and so the first few basis functions are

where Kn(cid:2)1 and dx/dxi denote that the integral is taken over all of
the variables except for xi, and likewise for Kn(cid:2)2 and dx/dxidxj. These
functions are orthogonal to each other, and can therefore be
expressed as an expansion of basis orthogonal functions 4, e.g.,

The basis functions have the property that, for k > 0, E[Jk] 1⁄4 0,
since Jk 1⁄4 JkJ0. As a result, the expectation of y is the first spectral
mode strength y0. The uncertainty, which can be calculated from
Eq. (8), is then

where the expansion is truncated at a suitable order l. The indi-
vidual coefficients can be determined by exploiting the orthogo-
nality of the functions 4,

The lower bound of the above summation is k 1⁄4 1 rather than 0 in

order Hermite polynomial contains a first-order term, and every
even-order Hermite polynomial contains a second-order term, and
so g and H have a contribution from each spectral mode strength.

prediction uncertainty, again calculated from Eq. (8), takes on a
similar form in the case of HDMR as for the polynomial chaos
expansion, i.e.,

A common choice for 4 is a set of polynomials which are
orthogonal over Kn [185,186].
In this case, then, the HDMR
expression is closely related to the polynomial chaos expansion.
The challenge of both HDMR and the polynomial chaos expansion is
that they require multidimensional integrals in order to calculate
the coefficients of the expansion, namely Eqs. (14) and (22).

2.3.

Intrusive methods

When performing numerical simulations, computations are
almost always more efficient if an analytic Jacobian can be calcu-
lated. Likewise, uncertainty calculations are almost always more
efficient if the system is amenable to an analytical treatment of the
uncertainty. These methods are termed intrusive because the
governing equations must be modified to take advantage of the
analytical treatment. Two intrusive methods are presented below:
the stochastic spectral projection method and the sensitivity-
analysis-based method.

PC spectral projection of L. Typically, the uncertainty in the pa-
rameters x would be propagated into the solution y. For instance,
the description of X 1⁄4 x(0) þ x(1)x of Section 2.2.1 is an example of a
PCE for x, with dimension Nd 1⁄4 n and order No 1⁄4 1.

As another example, the PC spectral projection method was
applied to the incompressible NaviereStokes equations [180,191],
which give the velocity field u in terms of the pressure p and
Reynolds number Re.

2.3.1. Stochastic spectral projection

The intrusive stochastic spectral projection method is a tech-
nique for analytically calculating the terms in a PC representation of
a simulation result.
it is
Its advantage is that,
straightforward to apply to any system of differential equations.
This methodology was applied by Ghanem and Spanos [187,188] to
problems in civil engineering, and later to fluid mechanics by Najm,
Ghanem, and coworkers [180,189] and by Xiu and Karniadakis
[190,191] and by Xiu and Karniadakis [190,191]. The application of
the method was subsequently extended to chemical kinetics
[164e166,192e194].

in principle,

Recall the generalized dynamical system defined in Eq. (3),
L(s,t,y;x) 1⁄4 f(s,t;x), where L represents the governing physical
equations and f is a forcing term, both of which depend on the
system state y, position s and time t, and are parametrically
dependent on the model parameters x. Because we treat x as
random variables which have PCEs, y and f are also random vari-
P
P
ables and have PCEs, e.g., y 1⁄4
k. Then the system L itself
k1⁄40yk
can also be expressed in a PC form. As an example, following Xiu
and Karniadakis [181], consider the first-order system _y 1⁄4 (cid:2)xy. The
constant x and the solution y have PCEs y 1⁄4
k and
x 1⁄4
k. These PCEs can be substituted into the original
system, which yields

As can be seen from Eq. (25), expressing L in terms of the PC
basis transforms the single dynamical system L(y) into P þ 1
coupled dynamical systems Lk(y). These coupled equations are the

if Re is random. For example, Najm, Ghanem, and coworkers [180]
considered an uncertain viscosity. Xiu and Karniadakis [190,191]
considered uncertain boundary conditions. Najm and coworkers
observed difficulties in obtaining convergence with highly-
nonlinear systems such as chemically-reacting systems [192], but
this problem was solved by using a multi-wavelet expansion
method [165,193,194], wherein the basis random variables are
piecewise-uniform random variables.

As an example taken from Ref. [194], Fig. 9 shows the time
evolution of the PDF of temperature during ignition of a stoichio-
metric methane/air mixture at 1050 K. At early times, the tem-
perature PDF shows one peak near 1500 K due to the initially slow
oxidation process. As time progresses, a peak near 2700 K begins to
form due to the system reaching equilibrium, while the low-
temperature peak spreads out. There is very little probability of
the system being between the two peaks because the ignition, and
therefore transition between the low-T and high-T states, is fast. The
multi-wavelet formulation captures the bifurcation between the
two states.

2.3.2. Sensitivity-analysis-based method

The complete PC representation of the energy conservation
equation can prove cumbersome to calculate, as has been noted
previously [164,166,192]. An alternative method for calculating the
Taylor series is the Sensitivity-Analysis-Based method (SAB) of
Wang and coworkers [195]. Many algorithms provide, along with
the solution variables y, the sensitivity coefficients S, where the
sensitivity Si of a solution variable y to the ith model parameter qi is
given by

Si 1⁄4

(31)

The model parameters q are then related to the normalized

systems [195]. For instance, the uncertainties in Fig. 8 were calcu-
lated using this method.

2.4. Non-intrusive methods

The advantage of the intrusive methods is that uncertainties can
be directly calculated. However, in many cases, the governing
equations are not amenable to an intrusive reconstruction, as was
concluded, for example, by Najm and coworkers for the chemical
source term [164,166,192]. In principle, the model prediction's
Taylor series could be calculated by finite difference, but this is
cumbersome. The alternatives to finite-difference calculation of the
Taylor series can be grouped into two general classes: quadrature
methods and random sampling methods. These methods are
essentially variations on statistical regression techniques.

Frenklach and coworkers developed the solution mapping
technique, using central-composite factorial designs to calculate
the Taylor series [17,159]. McRae and coworkers developed the
Deterministic Equivalent Modeling Method (DEMM), which uses a
quadrature method to evaluate the PCE coefficients of an uncertain
model output [163]. In addition to their intrusive and pseudo-
spectral methods, Najm and coworkers developed the Non-
Intrusive Spectral Projection (NISP), which uses random sampling
to calculate the PCE coefficients in Eq. (14). Rabitz and coworkers
developed the Random-Sample High Dimensional Model Repre-
sentation (RS-HDMR) [186,196], using random sampling to calcu-
late the HDMR coefficients in Eq. (22) [185,186]. RS-HDMR was
applied by Tomlin [134,197e199] as well as Chelliah [200,201] and
coworkers to a range of uncertainty analysis problems in
combustion.

2.4.1. Solution mapping

Solution mapping by Frenklach and coworkers [17,202] was the
earliest effort to apply response surface methodologies to com-
bustion model development. As a component of this method, a
central-composite (CC) design is generated within the reaction rate
uncertainty space and the derivatives are calculated using standard
linear regression. A CC design consists of an axial design and a
factorial design, which can be fractional. For an n-active parameter
problem, the axial design evaluates the model at the 2n þ 1 points
in the reaction uncertainty space: xi 1⁄4 0 (i 1⁄4 1, ... n) and then along
each major axis xi 1⁄4 ±Dx with xjsi 1⁄4 0. The perturbation Dx 1⁄4 2n/4 is
chosen to ensure that the design is rotatable, i.e., that the infor-
mation taken from the model evaluations does not depend on the
orientation of the design in model parameter space [203].

if a fractional

The factorial design consists of evaluating the model at all
corner points in the parameter space such that xi 1⁄4 ±1. There are 2n
such possible combinations, and so a design such as this is referred
to as a 2n design. For a large number of parameters, the number of
model evaluations becomes quite large, and so it may be
economical to use a fractional factorial design of 2n(cid:2)p points, with p
an arbitrary reduction factor. Such designs are termed 2n(cid:2)p designs.
The resolution of the design is a critical parameter to estimate its
performance;
factorial design has resolution
r 1⁄4 v þ w, then estimates of derivatives of order v contain effects
from interactions of order no lower than w. The sparsity of effects
principle states that interactions of third order and higher should
be negligible, and so to calculate second-order derivatives requires
a design of resolution V or higher. There is much literature on
developing fractional factorial designs [204], which need not be
repeated here, but it can be shown that the size of a resolution V
design grows as n2, due to the need to calculate n(n(cid:2)1)/2 second-
order derivatives. The reduction factor p must be sufficiently
small for the design to contain the required number of model
evaluations.

where qi,0 is the nominal value and fi is its prescribed uncertainty

qi takes on its maximum or minimum values, respectively. It can
then be shown that the gradient g is related to the sensitivity co-
efficients by

gi 1⁄4 y0Si ln fi

(33)

The terms of the Taylor series are then computed by performing
2n þ 1 sensitivity calculations, one at x 1⁄4 0 and then others at
xi 1⁄4 ±Dx, with xjsi 1⁄4 0. The perturbation Dx is chosen arbitrarily;
ideally, the derivatives should be taken in the limit as Dx / 0, but
finite values might be chosen to improve the accuracy of the
computed Taylor series over a wider range of x [195]. The terms of g
and Hessian H are calculated by finite difference.

2.4.2. Deterministic equivalent modeling method

The Deterministic Equivalent Modeling Method was developed
and used by McRae and coworkers [163,205e207]. This method is
probabilistic and relies on being able to calculate the expectations
in Eq. (14). For the case of a Wiener-Hermite chaos, the integral is
evaluated using Gauss-Hermite quadrature. In this method, the
dimension Nd 1⁄4 n and order No of the PC expansions are selected.
The number of coefficients in a PC expansion grows approxi-
mately as NNd
o , and the orthogonal Wiener-Askey polynomials have
No distinct roots, so a grid of points made from possible combina-
tions of these roots has NNd
o members. The expectation is evaluated

An example of the output from DEMM is shown in Fig. 10, taken
from Refs. [163], which plots the H2 concentration with respect to
time in supercritical water oxidation. The initial concentrations are
fixed, so there is no uncertainty. Over time, the uncertainty in the
species concentrations grows due to uncertainty in the rate con-
stants and in the heats of formation of key species; it eventually
shrinks to 0 because the reaction will eventually proceed to
completion. Fig. 10 also underscores the utility of having an un-
certainty structure such as the PCE or Taylor series, because then
the uncertainty in the solution due to a particular model parameter
can be easily extracted. For instance, the uncertainty due to a single
rate constant (H2O2 / 2OH) and to a key heat of formation (HO2) is
compared to the total uncertainty in the H2 concentration. These
two parameters account for the bulk of the total uncertainty.

2.4.3. Non-intrusive spectral projection

The Non-intrusive Spectral Projection (NISP) method [164,166]
was developed to address accuracy concerns in their intrusive
methods. This method is similar to the DEMM except that it uses
Monte Carlo integration with Latin Hypercube sampling (LHS)
instead of Gauss-Hermite quadrature. In this case, the expectations
are given by

where, similar to DEMM, y(xi) is the realization of the uncertain y at
the ith point in the LHS sequence, which contains M points, and
Jk(xi) is the kth Hermite polynomial. An example of the solution

using NISP is shown in Fig. 11, adapted from Ref. [164], which shows
the OH mass fraction as a function of position in supercritical water
oxidation, under the same conditions as [163]. The uncertainty
increases quickly in the reaction zone, then converges to a constant
value due to the uncertainty in the heat of formation of a key
species.

2.4.4. Random-sample high-dimensional model representation

Random-Sample High-Dimensional Model Representation (RS-
HDMR) was developed by Rabitz and coworkers [184e186,196] and
implemented in combustion simulations by Tomlin [134,197], Davis
[199,208], Chelliah [201] and their respective coworkers. Like So-
lution Mapping, DEMM, and NISP, it uses black-box model evalua-
tions to calculate the integrals necessary for the uncertainty
calculations; the RS-HDMR implementation of Tomlin and co-
workers uses Sobol' sampling [209] rather than LHS sampling. In
this case, the integral in Eq. (22) is solved by

it comes to a treatment of the uncertainty distribution of the rate
coefficient, they probably represent the two limiting cases. Fig. 15
shows the probability distributions of the flame speed computed
for an ethyleneeair mixture at the equivalence ratio ɸ 1⁄4 0.7,
assuming either normally-distributed or uniformly-distributed re-
action rate parameters in USC Mech II [16]. The probability distri-
butions of the flame speeds calculated from the two limiting
distributions of x are similar. The lack of sensitivity to the assumed
probability distribution can be explained by the central limit the-
orem as discussed in Ref. [178]. This observation is in fact quite
essential to the accuracy of forward model uncertainty projection.

3. Uncertainty minimization

3.1. Limitations of forward uncertainty propagation

Much of our discussion, and indeed most of the UQ work, so far
has focused on forward uncertainty propagation, where the un-
certainty in the rate parameters is prescribed and, in principle,
mathematically independent. Forward UQ projection is useful in
that the accuracy of a chemical model may be assessed as needed as
new and more accurate knowledge from rate measurement or
theoretical analysis is made available. Following such an approach,
the accuracy of a chemical model can be improved, in principle, as
rate parameters are probed with improved accuracy and precision,
targeted studies. This is the approach
through UQ-initiated,
advanced by, for instance, Klippenstein, Tomlin and coworkers
[107,130,198,225]. In these studies, screening designs are used to
identify reaction steps with the greatest influence on uncertainty,
and then those reactions are targeted for investigation in greater
detail.

On the other hand, the need to develop combustion models of a
wide range of complex fuels (and the rate at which these models
are published) has left us with large numbers of rate parameters
with large uncertainty. As an example, the uncertainties in the
modeled laminar flame speeds shown in the left panel of Fig. 8 are
considerably larger than the uncertainties in the combustion
experimental measurement. Hence, the measurements contain
useful, quantitative information that can provide constraints to the
model parameters. Future progress is likely to be achieved more
efficiently through efforts from both ends of the spectrum of
combustion research: both by “chasing” the accuracy and precision
of individual rate coefficients and by pursuing an inverse problem
approach whereby the uncertain rate parameters are constrained
by combustion experiments to yield a joint probability distribution
or reduced sizes of the feasible parameter set. The view expressed
above is admittedly controversial and the research community has
not reached a consensus about how to engage in an efficient inte-
gration of the different approaches and methods. Nonetheless, we
shall discuss in what follows the mathematical treatment of the
inverse problem that considers the coupled uncertainties in the
rate parameters and combustion experiments.

3.2. The inverse problem

Because of the inherent limitations with direct estimates of
model rate parameters, there will always be a place for constraining
models against measurements, a technique mathematically termed
as the inverse problem. In essence, the models are “tuned” against
the experimental measurements, adjusting the model rate pa-
rameters within their uncertainty bounds until the model can
reproduce the observations. In principle, at least, solving the in-
verse problem results in a model with a set of rate parameters that
are closer to reality and have tighter uncertainties. A pitfall, how-
ever, is that there will never be enough experimental information

SO2 and 1.3% NH3. The line shows the first-order contribution to NO mole fraction of

rich CH4/air flame doped with SO2 and NH3 as a function of the
Arrhenius A factor for SO þ NH / NO þ SH. The flame is simulated
using the Leeds model [210], updated with the recommendations of
Baulch et al. [118] and augmented with SOx chemistry as described
in Ref. [134]. The variation in the NO concentration is determined
using Monte Carlo sampling, as shown by the scatter of points in
the figure. The Monte Carlo sample was then used as an input to Eq.
(39) to calculate the first order contribution of the A factor to the NO
concentration, that is, the effect due solely to the reaction
SO þ NH / NO þ SH. Note that the first-order effect is nonlinear,
because “order” in HDMR refers to the number of parameters
involved in the interaction, rather than the exponent of a particular
power. The remaining variation in the NO concentration is due to
the effects of other rate parameters.

2.4.5. Uncertainty estimation through Monte Carlo integration

In some cases, the gradient g and Hessian H might not be
straightforward to calculate or might be computationally costly, in
which case sy can still be determined using Monte Carlo methods
[15,102,178,211e215]. Examples of this are shown in Fig. 13,
adapted from Ref. [214] and Fig. 14, adapted from Ref. [102]. The left
panel of Fig. 13 shows the time histories of C2H4, OH, H2O and CO2
during shock-initiated ignition of heptane, which was modeled
using the unconstrained JetSurF version 1.0 [224]. The uncertainty
is visualized by a random sampling of 1000 points in the model
uncertainty space and random reaction time. The reaction time is
sampled log-uniformly between 10 and 10 000 ms. Fig. 14 shows the
laminar flame speed of H2/air mixtures at 1 atm and 298 K,
modeled using the Leeds model [210]. The uncertainty is deter-
mined by probabilistically weighted Latin Hypercube Sampling
within the model uncertainty space.

2.5. Probability distribution of rate uncertainty versus model
uncertainty

It is important to understand the difference in results between
uniformly and normally distributed rate coefficients (log k). When

to fully invert the problem in the realm of combustion chemistry.
Historically, the measurements chosen as combustion targets and
parameter adjustments against these targets have been treated on
an ad-hoc basis. The ad-hoc procedure ensures a set of model pa-
rameters that will reproduce the initial set of measurements, but
without an uncertainty estimate it is impossible to reliably inter-
polate or extrapolate outside this set. The proliferation of chemical
kinetic models that purport to describe the same chemical systems
is a manifestation of the problem, as we discussed earlier.

As an inverse problem, one would wonder whether it is suffi-
cient or even possible to carry out a set of well-controlled mea-
surements in a way that the rate parameters can be “pinned” to a
unique set of values. The answer is clearly no. To understand this
problem, we show in Fig. 16 the cross sections of the solution
surface for a large family of rate parameters that can give the 40 cm/
s consensus value of the early 1990s for the atmospheric laminar
flame speed of the stoichiometric methane-air mixture. As can be
seen, a known experimental quantity reduces the initial dimen-
sionality of the uncertain rate parameter space from a cube to a
surface. Hypothetically, one would just need to have at a minimum

Under this condition, the choices of the target sets impact the size
and shape of the confidence region, as illustrated also in Fig. 17:
the different target sets can give very different covariance of the
rate parameters. Lastly, a larger target data set does not always
lead to a reduced confidence region, because of uncertainties
inherent to the experimental data as well as possible structural
uncertainties.

Many groups have turned to Bayesian methods to address the
problem of uncertainty analysis and rate parameter constraint.
Inverse problems in chemical kinetics typically involve models
with a given number of uncertain parameters, along with a set of
experimental measurements whose simulations each depend on a
set of model parameters. Bayesian methods are highly adapted to
solving problems of this nature.

3.2.1. Overview of Bayesian methods

A Bayesian study consists of a set of uncertain model param-
eters x, defined on some accessible uncertainty space Kn4Rn and
assigned a PDF p(x), the prior PDF. A training set of measurements
is selected, with some measurement data yobs and associated
uncertainty sobs. A likelihood function p(x;yobs,sobs) can be
defined, written as a function of x and parametrically dependent
on yobs and sobs. This function describes how likely a particular
choice of model parameters is depending on how well it re-
produces the experimental observations, and represents the new
information coming from those observations. The prior p(x) and
likelihood p(x;yobs,sobs) can be combined, using Bayes' Theorem,
(cid:11)
(cid:11)
to determine an updated PDF p*ðx
(cid:11)yobsÞ, which is the posterior
PDF, given by,

The denominator in Eq. (40) is termed the evidence, which

ensures that p
depends strongly on the
form of p and p; in particular, p might be an implicit function of x,
which makes Eq. (40) difficult to evaluate. Furthermore, computing
integral,
the response requires performing a high-dimensional
especially in the case of chemical models.

*

Methods for solving Eq. (40) fall into three general classes.
The original work on Bayesian model updated by Beck and co-
workers [226e232] used Monte Carlo methods to evaluate Eq.
(40), work which was followed by Kraft [233e242], Raman [168],
Miki [243,244] and their respective coworkers. Sheen and Wang
proposed the Method of Uncertainty Minimization using Poly-
nomial Chaos Expansions (MUM-PCE) [15,178,214,215] to calcu-
late credible regions
space and the
corresponding uncertainty in model predictions, which involves
assuming a particular form for the posterior distribution. Tur(cid:1)anyi
and coworkers developed a similar statistical method [245e248],
and a similar method was applied by Burke and co-workers
[225] and Najm and co-workers [249]. Frenklach and co-
workers proposed the Data Collaboration method [132,250e
253], which uses
to calculate uncertainty
bounds on model parameters and predictions based on con-
straints from experimental observations.

3.2.2. Bayesian analysis

A Bayesian inference study requires making assumptions for the
form of p and p. A typical assumption is that the experimental
observations and model parameters are jointly normally distrib-
uted. This gives the following form for the prior p(x),

at equivalence ratio of 0.7 for normally-distributed rate parameters (◊, dashed line)

five independent flame speed values, say, over a range of equiva-
lence ratio or pressure, to invert the five-parameter system illus-
trated. In reality, this is not a feasible approach for at least two
reasons. First, most combustion experiments yield observations
that are dependent on each other, meaning that the five hypo-
thetical combustion experiments considered do not actually pro-
vide a unique solution within the five-dimensional uncertainty
space. Second, as the number of thermodynamic and stoichio-
metric conditions under consideration increases, the number of
influential rate parameters increases faster, so that there are more
unknown parameters being solved for than known constraints and
therefore the solution is non-unique. Therefore, the large param-
eter space and the difficulties of obtaining independent experi-
mental observation render the problem ill-defined mathematically.
Hence, an inverse problem with UQ treatment alone cannot achieve
predictive combustion chemistry modeling, but it can produce
impactful results, as we demonstrate in Figs. 8 and 13dthe
fundamental combustion experiments provide constraints on and
give a joint probability distribution for the rate parameters within
their respective uncertainty bounds.

As an example, we show a plot (Fig. 17) adapted from the work
of Miller and Frenklach [35]. In their work, the rate coefficients of
two reactions that are most influential to the overall rate of the
thermal decomposition of propane at a temperature of 1100 K
and molar density of 6 (cid:4) 10(cid:2)5 mol/cm3 were treated by an inverse
problem against experimental target sets defined by the con-
centrations measured for five decomposition products at 0.7 ms
from the onset of reaction. The two reactions are the CeC fission
in propane (C3H8 / CH3 þ C2H5, k1) and H-abstraction of propane
by the methyl radical (C3H8 þ CH3 / CH4 þ i-C3H7, k2). In Fig. 17,
the various contours represent the 95% confidence region of the
(k1, k2) combination that can reproduce the different sets of data.
Several points can be made by an inspection of the plot. First, all
of the viable solutions are characterized by (k1, k2) contours of
finite size. This is a clear illustration of the difficulties associated
with rate coefficient determination under clean, chemically iso-
lated condition. Often, an experiment can only determine coupled
rate coefficients or a confidence region in the parameter space.

3.2.3. Bayesian analysis using Markov chain Monte Carlo

A straightforward method of solving Eq. (40) is by using Monte
Carlo integration. This is the approach proposed by Beck and
Katafygotis [226,227] and employed by Beck [228e232], Kraft
[233e241], Raman [168], Miki [243,244] and their coworkers. Many
of these studies used Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling,
specifically the MetropoliseHastings algorithm [254] to evaluate
the posterior. In this method, a random point x0 is chosen within Kn,
and the function f(x0) 1⁄4 p(x0)p(x0;yobs) is evaluated. Then, a new
′
point x0 is proposed, and f(x
) evaluated. An acceptance probability
is defined as pacc 1⁄4 min[1, f(x′
)/f(x0)]. The point x0 is accepted with
this probability, in which case x1 1⁄4 x0, otherwise it is rejected and
x1 1⁄4 x0. A new x0 is proposed and compared to x1, and an x2 is
selected. This process continues until N points have been selected.
For sufficiently large N, the set of samples x is equivalent to sam-
*
pling from the posterior probability p
. This sample can be used to
calculate the mean and variance of any parameter. Furthermore, if
there is some model output y, then the expectation E[y] can be
calculated using.

An example of the output from this method is shown in Fig. 18,
which compares the prior and posterior joint PDF for two Arrhenius
A factors, adapted from Ref. [168]. Because the posterior PDF is
being determined based on Monte Carlo sampling, it must be
approximated by a two-dimensional histogram. Therefore, what is
being plotted in Fig. 18 is the local sample density; for any point, the
local sample density counts about how many points in the final set
of samples are in some sense close to this point.

3.2.4. Uncertainty minimization through polynomial chaos
expansion

Monte Carlo integration has the advantage that it can be used
for virtually any choice of p and p. For some well-behaved choices,
*
it can be more efficient to find an explicit form for the posterior p

An example of the output from this method is shown in Fig. 19,
which compares the prior and posterior joint PDF for two Arrhenius
A factors, adapted from Ref. [214]. Because there is an explicit
probability density function, the contours of the PDF are smooth
lines.

As was discussed in the introduction, the measure of a model is
how useful it is at making predictions. For instance, the prior pre-
diction uncertainty shown in the left panels of Figs. 8 and 13 is large
with respect to the experimental measurement uncertainty, and so
the prior model makes predictions less precise than the experi-
ment. The posterior parameter uncertainties from Eq. (47), how-
ever, can be propagated into Eq. (10), which yields the posterior
prediction uncertainties shown in the right panels of Figs. 8 and 13.
In these cases, the prediction uncertainties are substantially
reduced from the prior, indicating the improved ability of the
model to make more precise predictions. Likewise, the rate con-
stant estimate for the reaction H þ O2 þ N2 4 HO2 þ N2 is shown in

Fig. 20, adapted from Ref. [245]. The prior uncertainty is estimated
by a review of literature estimates and is almost a factor of two
under some conditions. This value is much larger than the uncer-
tainty estimated by Baulch [118] and certainly very large for this key
reaction. The posterior uncertainty is as little as a few percent.

The Data Collaboration [132,250e253] method differs from
other Bayesian methods in that it does not use an explicit proba-
bility density function to solve Eq. (40). Instead, it is assumed that
the rate parameters and the experimental measurements follow an
interval distribution. Each model parameter and measurement is
characterized by a mean and an uncertainty. Then the accessible
rate parameter space Kn is just the hypercube, Kn:{(cid:2)1 < xi < 1}.

air laminar premixed flames. The point of the exercise in Ref. [132]
was that, if any pair of rate coefficients is held fixed, it is often not
possible to choose a value for the third, variable rate coefficient. The
only reliable way to determine the best model is by a simultaneous,
joint consideration of the rate parameter uncertainties.

3.2.6. Balance between mathematical and physical rigor

For this section, we briefly introduce two considerations in the
solution of inverse problems, those of mathematical rigor and
physical rigor. In an inverse problem physical rigor refers to exer-
cises that consider, for example, all chemical pathways relevant to
the experimental observations under consideration or the repre-
sentation of the probability distribution of the rate parameters. If an
important pathway is not included, then there will be too few de-
grees of freedom in the model and solutions of the inverse-problem
is not expected to capture all measurements. Mathematical rigor
refers to capturing all of the high-order dependence of the simu-
lation on the model parameters. If too many assumptions are made,
e.g., excessive truncation of high-order terms, the uncertainty in
the rate parameters will be misestimated. In both cases, model
parameters may be driven to unreasonable values.

In any inverse-problem study, there is an inherent trade-off
between mathematical and physical rigor. For instance,
the
MCMC methods described in Section 3.2.3 are highly mathemati-
cally rigorous because they make no assumptions about how the
model predictions depend on the rate parameters, but because of
the computational cost they must sacrifice physical rigor and have
been limited to a small number of active rate parameters.
Conversely, MUM-PCE and similar methods
[15,178,214,215,
245,246,248] assume that the model predictions are close to
linear in the rate parameters, thus sacrificing mathematical rigor,
but the relative smaller computational costs have allowed the study
of systems with dozens of parameters [214].

A specific case of the tradeoff of physical rigor for mathematical
rigor has been the treatment of temperature-dependent rate un-
certainty. As discussed in Section 2.1, the three rate parameters
each have their own uncertainty, which allows for a potentially
elaborate description of the rate constant uncertainty with respect
to temperature [172e174]. In principle,
in an inverse-problem
study, each of these three parameters would be subject to
constraint, thereby constraining the temperature-dependent un-
certainty. Because of the computational cost, essentially tripling the
number of parameters that must be considered, previous studies
considered uncertainty in the Arrhenius A term only. Only recent
studies have begun to consider this kind of temperature-dependent
uncertainties [215,245,246,248]. Similarly, the inverse-problem
conducted so far have been restricted to high-

3.3. Defining the experimental measurement uncertainty

3.3.1. Experimental uncertainty analysis

The solution to a Bayesian inference problem, such as that
presented in Section 3.2,
is highly sensitive to the choice of
experimental uncertainty in Eq. (43). In the development of MUM-
PCE [15,178], an uncertainty value is estimated for each measure-
ment. In some cases, this value was provided by the experimen-
talist, and in others it might need to be estimated by statistical
analysis. For instance, in the work of Sheen and Wang [178], the
uncertainties in ethylene/air laminar flame speeds were set to be
2 cm/s based on consensus, whereas the uncertainties in ethylene/
oxygen/argon ignition delay times were determined by a cross-
conditional regression.

[245,246,248], an additional error term is included in the model

This form for Stot has the effect of increasing the model uncer-

work of Raman and coworkers [168]. In this work, the uncertainties

indication of goodness-of-fit. The effects of this change are shown
in Fig. 22, taken from Refs. [168], which shows a comparison of a
solution using the likelihood in Eq. (51) with one using Eq. (42). The
figure shows the measured laminar flame speeds of H2/CO/He
mixtures from Burke et al. [106] along with posterior uncertainty
estimates by Raman and coworkers [168]. As can be seen in the
figure, in the case of a fixed experimental uncertainty, the model
does not agree with some of the experimental measurements; the
model cannot be reconciled with every measurement. If the un-
certainty is an optimized parameter, the model can be brought into
agreement with these measurements, at the cost of a significantly
increased uncertainty in the rate coefficients. As was argued [168],
this additional uncertainty represents the goodness-of-fit of the
model. Expressing the experimental uncertainty in this way,
however, has the disadvantage of enforcing homoscedasticity on
the model, i.e., the uncertainty is the same for all experiments.

The Data Collaboration method uses a consistency analysis
method [250] that is similar in concept to the Bayesian error
methods (see, e.g., Ref. [168]). In Data Collaboration, the feasible
region Fn will be empty if the model cannot be reconciled with all
measurements. A threshold uncertainty C∅ is defined such that Fn
will be empty if all of the experimental uncertainties are reduced by

model uncertainty, as they are representative of goodness-of-fit.
Taken too far, however, they can be interpreted as putting too
much of the responsibility for the error on the model and not
enough on the experiment. For instance, if one measurement value
is particularly far from the posterior model prediction, that mea-
surement will destroy any precision that might have been obtained
from other measurements. In extreme cases, the posterior uncer-
tainty will be greater than that of the prior model.

MUM-PCE does not consider these additional uncertainties;
instead, it uses a consistency analysis and outlier detection algo-
rithm. In this method, for every measurement that is inconsistent
with the posterior model, a consistency criterion W is calculated as

Both approaches to outliers are fraught with peril. As argued by
Raman and coworkers [168], trusting the experimental uncertainty
estimate and allowing the outliers to lie out results in a very precise
determination of the rate parameters. In point of fact, because of
the need to adjust the uncertainty to account for the outliers, much
of the information contained in the experimental measurements is
lost; the posterior uncertainty of the model is not much better than
the prior, as shown in Fig. 22 [168]. If the experimental measure-
ments are actually in error, then it makes sense not to consider
them further [15,178,214]. However, if the disagreement between
the measurement and the model is actually due to a structural
problem with the model, such as a missing reaction pathway or an
underestimated rate coefficient uncertainty, information about the
missing structure will be present in the outlier experiments;
removing the experiments from consideration destroys this infor-
mation. There is no easy way to determine which class any
particular outlier falls.

In later work, Tur(cid:1)anyi and coworkers [248] tried to resolve these
issues using a hybrid approach, in which certain measurements
with potentially large systematic errors were not considered in the
optimization to begin with. Furthermore, after the first uncertainty
minimization step, measurements that could not be reproduced to
within 4sobs were removed from consideration, and a second
minimization step was conducted.

This section highlights some of the recent applications of un-
certainty quantification in combustion chemistry. It is shown that

24

the UQ analysis can yield from useful to critical results that are not
obtainable without the use of the UQ methods.

4.1. Rate rules and their uncertainties

All reaction kinetic models of large hydrocarbon fuels use rate
rules for their construction. Such a practice is rooted in the chem-
ical similarity rule in which elementary reactions similar in nature
usually have similar rate coefficients. The rate-rule assumption is
the foundation of all automatic reaction mechanism generation and
chemical lumping (see, e.g., Refs. [255e261]). The rate-rule prin-
ciple removes the need to know the rate coefficient of every reac-
tion before a reaction model can be constructed, as this is
impossible in combustion chemistry. The practice also introduces
two coupled uncertainties: the measured or computed rate coef-
ficient used for a class of reaction is inherently uncertain, and the
application of the rate rule for a similar but different reaction can
lead to additional uncertainty. In principle, no two elementary re-
actions have the same rate coefficients. The chemical similarity rule
is accurate only to first order and higher order effects are then the
uncertainty in the individual rate parameters among a class of
similar reactions. In this case, the rate parameters within the same
reaction class are all coupled.

Rate-rule induced uncertainty has received some recent atten-
tion, though a general consensus about how to treat this uncer-
tainty and especially the coupling of the rate parameters in a
reaction class is still emerging. In a recent paper, Najm, Pitz and
coworkers [176] carried out a study of uncertainty quantification of
reaction models with a specific aim to account for correlations
introduced by rate rules and fitted Arrhenius parameters. Of
particular interest is that the authors highlighted the improved fi-
delity of the model when correlations are accounted for and the
computational savings associated with the rate rule due to the
reduced dimensionality of the UQ problem. The authors used a
recent foundational fuel chemistry model of Curran and coworkers
[262,263] and examined rate parameter correlation and rate rule
uncertainties on the prediction of ignition delay times of a stoi-
chiometric propane/ethane/air mixture at constant pressure of
10 atm and initial temperature of 1000 K. They found that ac-
counting for dependence among rate parameters of rate rule in
origin can lead to different results in the uncertainty predicted for
the ignition delay time. Overall, the study suggests that proper
accounting for rate rules and rate parameter fitting correlations is
critical to robust and accurate estimation of uncertainty in pre-
dictions using chemical kinetic models.

In practical reaction model development using an inverse
problem, the rate parameters within a reaction class may be
assumed to be initial guesses of the rate value and treated as being
decoupled from each other. This was the underlying assumption in
Sheen and Wang [214] in their modeling study of multispecies time
histories of n-heptane oxidation in a shock tube. In a more recent
study, Cai and Pitsch [175] took a quite different view. They argued
that modification of individual rate parameters within a reaction
class violates the consistency of rate parameters of similar reactions
and in this context, it is more useful to constrain the rate param-
eters for the entire class as such an approach would lead to a more
consistent model optimization. Using MUM-PCE, they demon-
strated that it is possible to make improved prediction and reduce
the prediction uncertainty by optimizing a reaction model against a
range of shock tube ignition delay data for n-pentane.

4.2. Consistency of experimental dataset

any inverse problem approaches to chemical kinetic modeling, a
careful examination of the consistency of the experimental target
dataset is critical to the successful treatment of the problem. Let us
examine Eq. (46) as an example. Each experimental outlier would
skew the optimal set of the rate parameters and their feasible
ranges in the direction of the outlier. It is conceivable by consid-
ering two inconsistent data points, each giving a minimum in the
objective function, that the parameter constraining process would
yield an optimal parameter set that lies in the region separating the
two minima with the uncertainty spanning both sides of the local
minima. Detecting data outliers serves two purposes: one that al-
lows us to question the systematic or random error in the experi-
mental measurement in a systematic manner, and the other
allowing for elimination of erroneous measurements. The conclu-
sion of such an analysis is admittedly the result of a “majority-rule”
principle. The data points deemed inconsistent or in the minority
can indicate missing physics for the problem, e.g., including missing
reaction pathways or excessively bad rate estimates. Hence, outlier
detection can yield very useful results, but it should be used with
caution.

As an example, Frenklach and coworkers [250] extended the
approach of data collaboration to address the mutual consistency of
experimental observations. In their analysis, two major outliers of
the GRI-Mech II dataset were detected. Both are of the reaction
times to reach half of the maximal OH concentration in shock tube
oxidation of methane. It turns out that these were not actual
measurements but two “representative” points, at 2000 and
2200 K, extrapolated from a fit to a series of measurements per-
formed over a range of temperatures [264]. The pertinent re-
searchers were contacted about the results that had been flagged
by the analysis, though no indication was given about which di-
rection the measurements might be in error. A re-examination of
the original experimental data led the researchers to modify the
extrapolation and yield new improved estimation for the two data
points, both consistent with the direction indicated by the outlier
analysis. This example highlights the utility of outlier detection and
more importantly, the need for collaborative experimental, theo-
retical and UQ efforts to achieve measurable progress.

4.3. Assessment of systematic experimental uncertainty

The use of UQ to unravel systematic experimental uncertainty is
at its infancy. In a recent paper, Iaccarino, Hanson and coworkers
[265] examined the influences of initial radical impurities on the
determination of ignition delay times in H2/O2 mixtures. Two
separate methods were employed to quantify the H atom impu-
rities. The first method involves the measurement of the OH con-
centration upon shock heating of an oxygenediluent mixture in
absence of the hydrocarbon reactant. The second method infers the
H atom impurity concentration by comparing the experimentally
measured ignition delay against calculations. The analysis allows
them to propose a stochastic Arrhenius model that describes the
impurities behind reflected shock
amount of
waves. Furthermore, theoretical quantifications of the uncertainties
induced by the initial H-atom impurities shows that the effect
becomes more pronounced in the thermodynamic condition space
where the rate of H þ O2 radical chain branching reaction is greater
than the rate of H þ O2 chain termination reaction, as expected, and
such an effect is magnified with an increased dilution and with
decreased temperature or pressure. The effect becomes negligible

shock tube experiments, the authors were able to isolate the in-
fluence of initial radical impurities on the experiment. Monte Carlo
simulations showed that the H atom impurity can impact the
ignition delay by as much as 30%. Based on the analysis, the authors
uncovered the conditions over which the impurity effect can
become magnified, and as such, they demonstrate that a careful UQ
analysis of the experimental data coupled with kinetic modeling
can yield useful information for future experimental design.

4.4. Hierarchical model development

It has been understood for a long while that the mechanism of
high-temperature hydrocarbon oxidation has a hierarchical
structure [38]. The construction of reaction models of higher
hydrocarbon combustion begins with a model for H2/CO oxida-
tion. This base model is then rigorously checked against a set of
data to ensure its accuracy. The model then forms the basis for a
CH4 oxidation model, which is checked against its own set of data.
This process is continued to encompass progressively higher-
order hydrocarbons. While this is a logical way to proceed, the
quantitative accuracy of the result following this approach and
the uncertainty propagated from the lower level models of small
hydrocarbon combustion to those of the high-order hydrocarbons
has never been determined. There is always the concern whether
a higher-order hydrocarbon, say propane, may activate otherwise
dormant paths in say, the CH4 oxidation model. Additionally,
questions have been raised about what should be an efficient
experimental approach to arrive at a predictive combustion
chemistry model. For example, if one is interested in having a
model to predict accurate the heat release rate in laminar pre-
mixed combustion of n-octane, what would be the experimental
focus, keeping in mind that a direct measurement on the com-
bustion properties of n-octane may not be the most efficient or
direct path to an accurate n-octane model.

Quantitative relations among the hierarchical components of a
comprehensive hydrocarbon combustion reaction model were
recently examined by Sheen and Wang [266]. Using n-octane

combustion as an example and MUM-PCE as the underlying
method, they explore the accuracy of the hierarchical model
strategy by observing how the model constraining at each step
affects the later stages. Fig. 23 shows the prediction uncertainties
for the laminar flame speed of n-C8H18-air mixtures at 1 atm and
353 K unburned gas temperature. The prior model (JetSurf 1.0
[224]) predicts the flame speed to have 3e4 cm/s of 1s uncertainty.
The model was first constrained against an H2/CO and C2H4
experimental dataset, leading to Model III, which gives a signifi-
cantly reduced uncertainty in the predicted n-octane flame speeds.
The 1s uncertainty reduces from 3 to 4 cm/s to about 1.5 cm/s. With
further constraining using a C3 experimental dataset, the prediction
uncertainty decreases to 1 cm/s. Additional constraining, however,
did not lead to any noticeable improvements in terms prediction
uncertainty. The point of the study is that a high-precision model
for a higher-hydrocarbon combustion is usually better achieved by
constraining the hierarchical submodels at the H2/CO/C2H4/C3H6
level because it is the pyrolysis and oxidation chemistry of these
smaller species that govern the overall heat release rates.

4.5. Model reduction

As an enabling tool for the application of combustion chemistry
model in computational fluid dynamics, a wide range of model
reduction methods have been proposed and put in use (see, e.g.,
Refs. [125,267]). There are two aspects of UQ analyses in model
reduction. The first issue concerns the criteria in deriving of or the
assessment of the various truncation and approximation errors in a
reduced model. Traditionally the accuracy of a reduced or skeletal
model is assessed by comparing its performance against a detailed
model. Sheen et al. [15] pointed out that without considering the
inherent uncertainty in the detailed model, this comparison can
over-constrain the reduction criteria. In fact, a reduced model can
be said as accurate so long as it reproduces the detailed model
within its uncertainty bound. Second, although error propagation
algorithms have been proposed [268] within the framework of the
Directed Relation Graph (DRG) method [269,270], a basic treatment

predictions matters, but a characterization about how good
the predictions are matters perhaps even more.

(2) Significant progress in combustion chemistry has been made
over the last few decades, but in comparison to a large
portfolio of hydrocarbon fuels one may have to consider, the
pace of progress has been slow. One of the major reasons has
been the lack of consensus as to how to move forward in
obtaining a comprehensive, unified and predictive model of
fuel combustion. We argue that the solution is decidedly in
the UQ analysis. The various models, at least for the com-
bustion of small hydrocarbon fuels, in fact, can be and should
be unified since the different choices of the rate coefficients
can be interpreted as the uncertainties of the respective rate
parameters. The comprehensiveness of the model can be
addressed, in principle, by designing experiments with well-
characterized uncertainties targeted to reduce the joint
model parameter uncertainty space. The predictiveness of
the model is then assessed and ensured if the uncertainty of
the model can be defined outside of the thermodynamic
regimes tested and constrained.

of the underlying uncertainty magnification and propagation in
model reduction remains largely unavailable.

In a recent study, Xin et al. [271] used the combustion of n-
butane and i-butane as examples and derived reduced models from
a detailed chemistry model through directed relation graph (DRG)
and DRG-aided sensitivity analysis (DRGASA) methods. The accu-
racy of the reduced models was improved by constraining the
reduced model against experimental data. The dependence of
model uncertainty on the reduced model size was investigated
systematically by exploring skeletal models containing different
number of species. It was found that model uncertainty is subject to
the completeness of the model with respect to the underlying
physics. The uncertainty of a complete model is convergent and
asymptotic with respect to the model size while an incomplete
model is characterized by uncertainty behavior that is difficult to
predict. In particular, they showed that for a model having reactions
removed that exhibit second-order coupling with the remaining
reactions of the model, the accuracy of the model starts to fall apart.

4.6. Large eddy simulation

The ultimate aim of combustion modeling is to be able to un-
derstand turbulent combustion in engines or other energy con-
version devices. The recent work of Mueller et al. [272] extended
the forward uncertainty quantification work into large eddy sim-
ulations (LES) of turbulent flames. In this work, they performed an
LES solution for Sandia Flame D [273]da turbulent jet flame con-
sisting of a methane/air core surrounded by a fuel-lean acetylene/
hydrogen/air pilot flame. The core is richer than the rich flamma-
bility limit, and unburned oxygen from the pilot mixing into the
core causes the flame to ignite. The LES was performed using the
steady flamelet model of Peters [274]. In this algorithm, a set of
laminar diffusion flames at varying strain rate is solved. The solu-
tions are used to generate a lookup table for temperature, specific
volume, and composition as a function of the fuel/air mixture
fraction and scalar dissipation rate. These are termed the derived
properties.

The uncertainty in the LES solutions due to the chemical model
uncertainty was calculated using Gauss-Hermite quadrature as in
Eq. (38). No screening is used, so the LES uncertainty must be
calculated using the uncertainty of the full model. To reduce the
computational complexity, brute-force uncertainty analysis was
used only on the flamelet lookup table, which allowed the LES to be
solved over a much lower-dimensional uncertainty space. The
Arrhenius A factor of each rate coefficient was assumed to have a
lognormal distribution, so that the uncertain parameters could be
normalized using Eq. (32). The flamelet lookup table was deter-
mined by Latin hypercube sampling within the reaction uncer-
tainty space. It was found that the derived properties in the lookup
were approximately linear with respect to the reduced variables x.
for example, that the specific volume v can be

expressed as v 1⁄4 ax, where a is the vector of sensitivities of specific
volume to the rate coefficients. Furthermore, all of the derived
properties were closely correlated, so in effect the problem could be
treated as being one-dimensional and the quadrature needed
relatively few LES evaluations. Results for the LES-predicted tem-
perature and CO mass fraction profiles and their comparison with
experimental measurements are shown in Fig. 24.

5. Perspectives and concluding remarks

should be an integral part of any modeling effort. UQ is
necessary to combustion chemistry development. Making

(3) The application of UQ is inherently data and measurement
intensive. The work is best conducted as a collaborative
effort, and such an effort has proven possible in the past (e.g.,
the GRI-Mech effort). Currently computer codes that allow
for various UQ analyses are limited to in-house codes. There
is a need to make these codes available to a broader com-
bustion chemistry community for benchmarking, testing and
utilization. Prior efforts, including the PrIMe initiative [119],
might be important steps in that direction.

(4) The current paper provides a quite comprehensive review
about the mathematical principles and methods of uncer-
tainty quantification. Discussion is given about the sources
and classification of kinetic uncertainties and the meanings
and definitions of model verification and validation. The
various UQ methods are reviewed and classified, and their
applications are illustrated for problems involving forward
uncertainty quantification and propagation, and as an in-
verse problem leading to model uncertainty constraining. It
is shown that for combustion chemistry problems, while UQ
alone cannot produce accurate, individual rate parameters, it
can be instrumental in measuring the progress of our un-
derstanding of combustion chemistry and in utilizing
fundamental combustion property data beyond a simple
“agreeedisagree” statement. When treated as a Bayesian
inference problem, UQ is shown to aid the development of
predictive kinetic models in two separate aspects: the use of
fundamental combustion property data, global or local, to
provide the joint probability density function of the rate
parameters leading to a better constrained kinetic model.
Along with the forward kinetic uncertainty propagation, UQ
can yield estimates of model confidence to make predictions
outside of the thermodynamic regimes where the model has
been tested.

(5) This paper has demonstrated that UQ methods are mature
enough to become integral parts of combustion chemistry
research. These methods extend beyond simple sensitivity
analysis and transform detailed kinetic modeling from semi-
quantitative tests to the realm of quantitative modeling and
comparison. To this end, quantifying the limitations or the
uncertainty of a model is critical to identifying key scientific
problems. UQ methods should also provide a solution to the
“many-model” problem currently facing the combustion
chemistry community.

(6) The primary challenge that lies ahead is the advancement of
UQ tools that are widely accessible and easy to use by the
community. Currently, UQ methods such as those presented
in this paper have been slow to gain traction in the com-
munity. In order to gain wider acceptance, tools will need
better documentation and easy-to-use interface. The PrIMe
workflow, which implements
the Data Collaboration
method, have been steps in the right direction.
