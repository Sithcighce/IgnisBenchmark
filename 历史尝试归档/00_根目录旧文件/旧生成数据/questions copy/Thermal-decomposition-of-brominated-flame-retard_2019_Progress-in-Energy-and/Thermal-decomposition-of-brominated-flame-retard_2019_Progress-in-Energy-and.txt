Brominated flame retardants (BFRs) are bromine-bearing hydrocarbons added or applied to materials to
increase their fire resistance. As thermal treatment and recycling are common disposal methods for BFR-
laden objects, it is essential to precisely describe their decomposition chemistry at elevated temperatures
pertinent to their thermal recycling. Laboratory-level and pilot-scale investigations have addressed the
thermal decomposition of pure BFRs and/or BFR-laden polymers under oxidative and pyrolytic environ-
ments, typically at temperatures of 280–900 °C. These studies shed light on the effects of various factors
influencing the decomposition behaviour of BFRs such as chemical character, polymer matrix, residence
time, bromine input, oxygen concentration, and temperature. Although BFRs decomposition mainly oc-
curs in a condensed phase, gas phase reactions also contribute significantly to the overall decomposition
of BFRs. Exposing BFRs to temperatures higher than their melting points results in evaporation. Quantum
chemical calculations have served to provide mechanistic and kinetic insights into the chemical phenom-
ena operating in decomposition of BFRs and subsequent emissions of polybrominated dibenzo- p -dioxins
and dibenzofurans (PBDD/Fs). Under thermal conditions such as smouldering, municipal waste inciner-
ation, pyrolysis, thermal recycling, uncontrolled burning and fires, BFRs degrade and form brominated
products of incomplete combustion (BPICs). Thermal degradation of BFRs often proceeds in the presence
of bromine atoms which inhibit complete combustion. Major BPICs comprise brominated benzenes and
phenols in addition to a wide range of brominated aromatics. Pyrolytic versus oxidative conditions seems
to have very little influence on the thermal stability and decomposition behaviour of commonly-deployed
BFRs. Thermal degradation of BFRs produces potent precursors to PBDD/Fs. Experimental studies have es-
tablished inventories of PBDD/F emissions with alarming high yields for many BFRs. Co-combustion of
BFRs-containing objects with a chlorine source (e.g. polyvinyl chlorides) results in the emission of signifi-
cant concentrations of mixed halogenated dibenzo- p -dioxins and dibenzofurans (i.e. PXDD/Fs). Formation
of PBDD/Fs from incomplete BFRs decomposition occurs primarily due to the condensations of gas phase
precursors, including unaltered structural entities of some BFRs in their own right. Complete destruction
of BFRs promotes PBDD/Fs formation via de novo synthesis. Bromination of PBDD/Fs in gas phase re-
actions is more prevalent if compared with chlorination mechanisms of PCDD/Fs, which is largely domi-
nated by heterogeneous pathways. In uncontrolled burning and in simulated fly ash experiments, a strong
correlation between congeners patterns of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and PBDD/Fs indicate
that PBDEs function as direct precursors for PBDD/Fs, even in the de novo synthesis route. In this review,
we critically discuss current literature on BFRs thermal decomposition mechanisms; gather information
regarding the contribution of homogenous and heterogeneous routes to overall BFRs decomposition; sur-
vey all studies pertinent to the emission of PBDD/Fs and their analogous mixed halogenated counterparts
from open burning of e-waste, and finally, highlight knowledge gaps and potential directions that warrant
further investigations.

1. Introduction

Brominated flame retardants (BFRs) represent a broad group of
chemicals added to polymeric components in numerous consumer
products such as plastics, textiles, electronic equipment and fur-
niture to enhance their fire resistance. Close to 75 distinct BFRs
have been produced commercially [1] . Technical mixtures of poly-
brominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) were the most utilised BFRs
over the last few decades. Serious health and environmental con-
cerns have led to the usage and production of PBDEs being discon-
tinued worldwide. Hexabromocyclododecanes (HBCDs) and tetra-
bromobisphenol A (TBBA) are currently the two most commonly-
deployed  BFRs,  with  TBBA  accounting  for  more  than  half  the
world’s total BFR production:

HBCDs  and  TBBA  have  been  linked  with  toxic  characteristics
and classified as persistent organic pollutants (POPs) [2] . This, in
turn, has prompted the formulation and use of the next generation
of BFRs, known as novel BFRs (NBFRs).

BFRs are cost-effective, incur low decomposition temperatures,
have  little  effect  on  the  mechanical  properties  of  polymers,  and
display significant potential for delaying ignition [1 , 3] . BFRs have
gradually substituted different types of flame retardants (FRs), in-
cluding inorganic FRs, chlorinated FRs and nitrogen-containing FRs.
High global market demand over the past few decades has led to
dramatic increases in the production of BFRs. According to world
market  reviews,  the  estimated  global  demand  for  BFRs  in  2008
was more than 690,0 0 0 tons/year in comparison to reported pro-
duction of 20,0 0 0 tons/year in 20 0 0 [2] . BFRs typically encompass
5.0–10.0% and 19.0% by weight (wt) of treated plastics and printed
circuit boards, respectively [4] .

Based  on  their  intended  applications,  BFRs  could  be  incorpo-
rated into polymeric materials either as reactive or additive con-
stituents  [5] .  Reactive  or  backbone  BFRs  are  chemically  blended
with the polymers via forming covalent bonds. The produced poly-
mers are often termed as brominated polymers such as brominated
polystyrene.  On  the  other  hand,  additive  or  matrix  polymers  do
not chemically bind with the polymeric matrix. As a consequence,
additive BFRs could leach out of the treated objects during their
lifespans. This phenomenon is the main source of “indoor expo-
sure” to BFRs. Indoor exposure to reactive BFRs could also occur if
an excessive amount was reacted with the polymer during produc-
tion. TBBA and HBCDs are common examples of reactive and addi-
tive BFRs, respectively. Based on their physico-chemical properties,
BFRs are bio-accumulative and can endure long range atmospheric
transport  [6 –8] .  As  a  result,  concentrations  of  several  BFRs  have

cluding lakes [9] , air and dust [10 , 11] , soil [12] , biological samples
[13] , and the food chain [14] .

Used BFRs-treated articles in domestic, industrial and commer-
cial sectors are commonly discarded into regular municipal waste
streams  at  the  end  of  their  lifecycles.  Thermal  treatment  repre-
sents a mainstream strategy for disposal of materials laden with
BFRs. For example, pyrolysis has become the most advantageous
recycling system for thermostatic resins laden with BFRs [15] . In
this regard, several BFRs were reported to act as potent precursors
for the formation of polybrominated dibenzo- p -dioxins and diben-
zofurans  (PBDD/Fs);  i.e.,  a  group  of  chemicals  that  shares  simi-
lar notorious behaviour [16 , 17] with their chlorinated counterparts
(PCDD/Fs):

The toxicity profile of each isomers of PBDD/Fs depends on the
number and position of bromine atoms on the two benzene rings.
The  biological  effects  of  PBDD/Fs  are  similar,  if  not  identical,  to
those of their chlorinated analogues (PCDD/Fs) [18] . These two cat-
egories of halogenated aromatics were shown to display compara-
ble toxicological characters in terms of causing liver damage, wast-
ing syndrome, producing skin lesions, and thymic atrophy. Table 1
contrasts toxic equivalence factors (TEFs) for several congeners of
PBDD/Fs in reference to their analogous congeners in the PCDD/Fs
family.

Experimental studies have established inventories for the emis-
sion of PBDD/Fs from incineration of BFRs-containing fuels, such
combustible  fraction  of  municipal  waste  [19 , 20] ,  incineration  of
electronic  waste  [21] ,  and  from  open  burning  of  discarded  plas-
tic  resins  [22] .  These  studies  have  illustrated  phenomena  gov-
erning  generation  of  PBDD/Fs  from  BFRs.  When  subjected  to
heat  (i.e.  pyrolysis,  combustion  and  thermal  stress),  materi-
als  laden  with  BFRs  readily  degrade  and  present  a  high  ten-
dency  to  form  brominated  products  of  incomplete  combustion
(BPICs)  [23 , 24] .  Accidental  spontaneous  fires  of  polymeric  mate-
rials  laden  with  BFRs  often  result  in  the  emission  of  PBDD/Fs,
PCDD/Fs in addition to mixed polybrominated/chlorinated dibenzo-
p -dioxins,  and  furans  (PXDD/Fs;  X = Cl,  Br)  [25 , 26] .  Owing  to
the  high  bromine  and  chlorine  contents  in  electrical  and  elec-
tronic  wastes  (e-waste),  thermal  recycling  of  e-waste  often  pol-
lutes surrounding areas with large loads of PBDD/Fs and PXDD/Fs
[27 –29] .

Experimental studies have addressed thermal decomposition of
pure  BFRs  and/or  BFRs-laden  polymers  under  oxidative  and  py-
rolytic environments, typically in the temperature range of 280–
900 °C. As it is the case of the homogenous formation of PCDD/Fs,
formation of PBDD/Fs from BFRs occurs along two general path-
ways:  (1)  coupling  of  structurally-related  precursors,  and  (2)  via
the so- called “de novo synthesis” (i.e. burning off the carbon ma-
trix)  [30 –34] .  Weber  and  Kuch  [35]  reported  that  under  insuffi-
cient oxygen content, the precursor-derived pathway prevails over
de novo synthesis. In contrast, Vehlow et al. [36] and Ortuño et al.
[37] argued that the de novo pathway of PBDD/Fs is significantly
more  important  under  well-controlled  combustion  conditions.  It
has also been confirmed that the presence of transition metal ox-
ides, displays a strong positive catalytic effect and enhances the
thermal breakdown of BFRs considerably [38] . In real combustion
conditions, several factors affect the overall thermal decomposition
of BFRs. These factors include the chemical composition of the fuel,
the polymer matrix, residence time, mixing conditions, loads and
chemical forms of metallic species, bromine input, oxygen concen-
tration, and temperature.

Review articles of BFRs have mainly focussed on their environ-
mental occurrence, spatial distributions, toxicological effects, and
progress  in  analytical  chemical  detections  [2 , 39 –41] .  Weber  and
Kuch [35] present a definitive account of the pathways leading to
the  formation  of  PBDD/Fs  from  BFRs.  However,  this  survey  does
not  report  governing  thermo-kinetics  parameters  of  these  path-
ways nor it assess the feasibility of several competing major chem-
ical phenomena based on molecular modelling. Furthermore, the
review by Weber and Kuch [35] does not provide reasoning for the
commonly reported higher concentrations of PBDFs in reference to
PBDDs, and it does not describe the exact modes of interactions of
gas phase precursors with metallic species in relevant combustion
systems. The role of brominated benzenes and diphenyl ethers, and
surface-bound phenolate and catecholic intermediates, in acting as
building  blocks  for  the  synthesis  of  PBDD/Fs  has  generally  been
overlooked in Weber and Kuch’s review [35] . The review by We-
ber and Kuch’s review [35] has only reported thermal decompo-
sition  a  few  BFRs.  As  will  be  shown  throughout  the  review,  re-
cent quantum chemical studies elucidated lower energy pathways
for  the  formation  of  PBDD/Fs  from  decomposition  of  these  BFR
than  those  proposed  in  Weber  and  Kuch’s  review.  Most  impor-
tantly, the review by Weber and Kuch’s limited the role of poly-
mers to producing H atoms that lower the overall yields of higher
brominated  congeners  without  accounting  for  the  intrinsic  com-
plex reactions between the polymer’s skeletons and impregnated
BFRs.

The  present  timely  survey  updates  Weber  and  Kuch’s  review
[35] ,  critically  summarises  pertinent  research  that  has  been  car-
ried out since its publication in 2003; and presents new mecha-
nistic insight into the decomposition of BFRs and prevailing syn-
thesis  routes  of  PBDD/Fs  and  their  mixed  halogenated  counter-
parts. Mechanistic pathways presented herein are mainly sourced
from  quantum  chemical  calculations;  surface  diagnostic  tech-
niques, observed patterns of halogenated congeners in laboratory-
scale and fields experiments, and reported interplay between var-
ious organohalogen and metallic constituents in thermal systems.
Herein,  we  survey  literature  studies  on  the  thermal  decompo-
sition  of  BFRs  with  emphasis  on  the  yields;  operational  condi-
tions, and formation routes of PBDD/Fs, and thermal abatements
technologies  recently  developed  to  treat  the  bromine  content  in
BFRs.

This review is organised as follows. First, we briefly present the
theoretical  modelling  methods  commonly  deployed  to  study  the
decomposition of BFRs, before describing decomposition products
and pathways of major BFRs. Next, we examine bromine combus-
tion chemistry, then we analyse the competing pathways operating
in the formation and halogenation of PBDD/Fs and PXDD/Fs. While
we elaborate on plausible future research directions in each section
of this review, we devote the Conclusion section to a summary of
the most focal, outstanding issues pertinent to the degradation of
BFRs in thermal systems.

2. Thermo-kinetics parameters and mechanistic pathways from
theoretical modelling

This  review  mainly  reports  thermo-kinetics  parameters  and
mechanistic pathways pertinent to pyrolysis, combustion and ther-
mal treatment of BFRs. The following chart highlights major chem-
ical phenomena that are discussed in this survey where thermo-
kinetics data were sourced via molecular modelling:

Computed  parameters  and  constructed  mechanisms  were
mainly  derived  by  quantum  chemical  calculations  with  the
underlying aim to provide an atomic-based insight into a rather
very  complex  combustion  medium.  Intermediates,  radicals  and
transition states are very short-lived for robust experimental mea-
surements.  Computational  chemistry  has  emerged  as  a  powerful
tool in combustion chemistry [42 , 43] . It provides accurate results
for  a  large  number  of  properties  of  interest  [44] ,  most  notably
bond dissociation enthalpies (BDHs) [45] , reaction rate constants
[46] ,  mechanisms,  p K a  values  [47] ,  vibrational  frequencies  [48] ,
ionization energies, and NMR shifts [49] . Thermochemical and ki-
netics parameters are subsequently computed for minimum energy
structures.  The  underlying  principle  in  all  computational  meth-
ods is to provide a solution for the time-independent Schrödinger
equation [50] . The basis of all numerical solutions to this equation
is the Hartree-Fock / self-consistent field approach which forms the
foundation for the more accurate electronic structure methods.

Post- Hartree-Fock methods or ab initio methods afford a more
realistic account for the electronic system. Ab initio methods dif-
fer  in  the  approaches  they  use  to  compute  the  correlation  en-
ergy [51] . Calculations based on ab initio methods are computa-
tionally expensive, but very accurate for general applications of or-
ganic  chemistry.  Density  functional  theory  (DFT)  methods  afford
reasonably satisfactory results with a considerably less computa-
tional time. DFT methods universally focus on the electron density
and differ in the way they present exchange and correlation func-
tionals [51] .

In carrying out these quantum chemical calculations, there is
a balance between the desired accuracy of results and the size of
the system (i.e. number of molecules or unit cells). When available,
calculated quantitates (i.e. bond lengths, equilibrium constants, lat-
tice parameters, BDH, etc.) are contrasted with corresponding ex-
perimental measurements in order to provide a benchmark or level
of accuracy. In gas phase reactions, the composite chemistry model
of  CBS-QB3,  and  meta-hybrid  DFT  functional,  such  as  BB1K  and
M062X  methods,  were  found  to  perform  very  well  in  deriving

thermochemistry  and  kinetics  parameters  for  Br-containing  sys-
tems.  For  instance,  calculated  BDHs  values  for  aromatic-C-Br  in
selected BFRs were found to correlate very well with the experi-
mental BDHs for the analogous bond in bromobenzene [52] . Other
satisfactory comparisons between modelled and experimental val-
ues germane to Br-containing compounds/surfaces include reaction
rate constants for dehydrobromination of brominated alkanes [53] ,
2 bulk [55] ,
p K a for bromophenols [54] , lattice parameters for CuBr
standard enthalpies of formation for brominated phenols and ben-
zenes  [56] ,  and  UV–visible  absorption  spectra  for  bromophenols
[57] . Quantum chemical calculations on BFRs systems in the litera-
ture were executed with the aid of several packages, most notably,
Gaussian [58] , DMol 3 [59] , and Vienna ab initio simulation package
[60] .

3. Thermal decomposition of major BFRs

3.1. Thermal decomposition of TBBA

Thermal decomposition of TBBA is very complex, due to com-
peting  physical  processes  and  chemical  reactions.  Experimental
studies  on  the  thermal  degradation  of  TBBA  have  focused  on
various  aspects,  namely:  (1)  overall  decay  of  TBBA,  (2)  degrada-
tion  versus  evaporation  routes,  (3)  selective  analysis  of  bromi-
nated  phenols,  brominated  benzenes,  and  PBDD/Fs,  (4)  distribu-
tion of bromine across brominated products and emission of HBr,
(5)  quantitative  analysis  of  all  brominated  products  of  incom-
plete combustion, (6) deriving reduced and detailed kinetic mod-
els, (7) suggesting mechanisms based on linking product profiles
with  plausible  reaction  networks,  (8)  the  effect  of  epoxy  resins
and other polymeric materials on the decomposition behaviour of
TBBA, and (9) the effect of metal oxides as HBr scavengers.

3.1.1. Overall decay of pure TBBA

Experiments  using  Thermogravimetric  analysis  TGA  (Ther-
mogravimetric  analysis)-FTIR  (Fourier  transform  infrared  spec-
troscopy) and DSC (Differential scanning calorimetry) -FTIR inves-
tigated the pyrolysis of TBBA at different heating rates/modes and
temperatures [61 –65] . These studies observed very similar degra-
dation  behaviour  and  provided  curves  of  total  weight  loss,  data
relevant  to  the  thermal  stability  of  TBBA,  gaseous  product  pro-
files,  differential  scanning  calorimetric  analyses,  mechanistic  in-
sights  into  primary  decomposition  steps,  and  evaporation  rates.
Fig. 1 shows the reported curves of TBBA weight loss from selected
studies. Luda et al. [64] used TGA at a heating rate of 10 °C min −1
in  an  inert  medium  to  reveal  that  the  decomposition  of  TBBA
proceeds  in  two  stages  of  weight  loss  -  200–290  °C  and  290–
500 °C. The first stage consumed nearly 60% of the initial TBBA
weight. The onset of the second stage, according to Barontini et al.
[66] using similar operating conditions, extends to nearly 350 °C.
In both studies, 20% of stable TBBA residue is left above 450 °C.
In  contrast  to  TBBA,  the  degradation  of  unbrominated  TBBA,  i.e.
bisphenol  A,  occurs  in  one  steep  interval  (200–270  °C)  without
leaving any residue [64] . Although thermal degradation could start
at temperatures as low as 185 °C, it only becomes significant above
230  °C  [67] .  A  longer  residence  time  of  isothermal  heating  pro-
motes condensation reactions over degradation reactions. As a re-
sult, isothermal TGA runs leave a larger residue when compared
with dynamic runs [67] . These aforementioned studies were car-
ried out in open flow systems, allowing for the minimisation of
the effects of secondary gas phase reactions on the degradation of
solid TBBA. Indeed, pyrolysis of TBBA under closed-vessel condi-
tions (i.e. quartz ampoules) results in a 100% weight loss [64] .

IR  spectra  measured  before  heating  and  at  the  end  of  the
first stage of weight loss afford valuable information on structural
modifications  and  prominent  plausible  initiation  reactions  [64] .

Displacement of the aromatic wagging vibrations and disappear-
ance of stretched phenol-OH bonds suggest that fissions of H
3 C-
aromatic and O –H bonds are likely to be significant initial decom-
position corridors. Isothermal TGA runs in a tubular reactor over
the temperature range 180–270 °C discloses that the overall de-
composition  of  TBBA  could  effectively  be  described  by  a  single-
step kinetic model [65] . Values of the pre-exponential ( A ) factor
and the activation energy ( E a ) were assigned to 3.76 × 10 13 s −1 and
179 kJ mol −1 , respectively.

Earlier mechanistic studies into decomposition of TBBA did not
account  for  the  significant  contribution  of  the  evaporation  route
[35] . Profiles of TBBA thermal degradation in a batch reactor and
TGA  provided  a  quantitative  assessment  of  the  contribution  of
evaporation  versus  degradation  to  overall  TBBA  decomposition.
Heating  TBBA  samples  in  crucibles  with  different  surface  areas
(and hence different evaporation rates) alters the overall decompo-
sition rate of TBBA [63] . Relating the amount of volatiles from TGA
data  to  mass  transfer  principles  and  quasi-steady-state  assump-
tions permits an approximate estimation of evaporation rates and
vapour pressure parameters for TBBA. These data allow evaluation
of the relative contributions of concurrent TBBA evaporation and
thermal degradation in the aqueous medium [63] . Fig. 2 depicts

evaporative and degradation fractions. In this regard, TBBA could
be treated as the polymeric material and its evaporation signifies
a chemical-like destruction of the polymer. As will be discussed in
Section 3.1.5 , evaporation of TBBA from brominated epoxy resins is
predicted to commence by a major chemical event, that is a 1,4-H
transfer. It is evident from Fig. 2 that the evaporation channel pre-
dominantly causes TBBA decay up to 230 °C, and still contributes
significantly at slightly higher temperatures (i.e. ∼18% at 270 °C).
Thus, products from the decomposition of TBBA at low tempera-
tures could be assigned to gas phase degradation pathways.

3.1.2. Decomposition products

Studies  on  the  thermal  degradation  of  TBBA  report  qualita-
tive,  semi-quantitative,  and  quantitative  data  on  the  decomposi-
tion products [61 –75] . The consensus of opinions in the literature
figure out that the primary degradation products from the pyrol-
ysis  of  TBBA  include  HBr,  brominated  phenols,  brominated  ben-
zenes, and brominated derivatives of bisphenol A, in addition to
solid residue (char). Fig. 3 [76] shows the yields of major prod-
ucts  measured  at  a  constant  heating  rate  of  10  °C  min −1 .  Para-
alkylated brominated phenols also form in low concentrations. For-
mation of brominated phenols and their alkylated substituents in-
dicate that cleavages of isopropylidene linkages act as prominent
initiation channels in the overall decomposition of TBBA. As will
be discussed in Section 3.1.3 , literature provides conflicting views
on  the  mechanisms  of  HBr  formation.  FTIR  results  indicate  that
evolved HBr accounts for 52–59% of the bromine initially present
in TBBA samples [66] . The presence of oxygen merely changes the
quantities of bromine converted to HBr relative to pure pyrolytic
conditions [66] . Closing bromine balance discloses that nearly 45%
of the initial bromine content transforms into condensable com-
pounds (volatile organic compounds, VOCs, and semi-volatile or-
ganic compounds,  SOVCs),  leaving only  1%  in the  char  [64] .  The
implications  of  bromine-deficient  char  on  de  novo  formation  of
PBDD/Fs will be elaborated on in Section 5.2 .

The  study  by  Barontini  et  al.  [62]  provides  a  comprehensive
quantitative  data  on  TBBA  decomposition  products  starting  from
its powder-like form. The authors carried out pyrolysis and com-
bustion  runs  on  TBBA  inside  a  tubular  reactor  at  600  °C  and
850 °C. GC/MS confirmed the formation of more than one hundred
VOCs/SVOCs.  The  isotope  dilution  method  was  used  to  identify
and quantitate each compound. Non-brominated products included
PAHs, partially-oxygenated compounds, alkanes and alkylated ben-

zenes. In addition to the major brominated products reported in
other studies (brominated phenols and brominated bisphenol A),
numerous  brominated  alkanes,  brominated  benzenes  and  bromi-
nated  polyaromatic  hydrocarbons  (PAHs)  also  evolved.  The  ob-
tained profiles of brominated phenols matched analogous profiles
from other studies and were dominated by 2,4,6-tribromophenol
and 2,4-/2,6-/dibromophenols.

Most of relevant studies investigated heating of solid TBBA sam-
ples;  rendering  it  is  not  feasible  to  decouple  predominant  reac-
tion routes occurring in the aqueous medium from those prevail-
ing in the gas phase upon evaporation of TBBA. Literature provides
a rather limited account on products and mechanisms from pure
gas pyrolysis of TBBA. Performing these experiments is challenging,
due to the very high boiling point of TBBA (180 °C). Very recently,
Saeed et al. [77 , 78] investigated decomposition of TBBA under in-
ert (i.e, thermolysis) and oxidative conditions. Experiments were
carried  out  via  introducing  a  controlled  rate  of  TBBA  vapor  into
a  tubular  reactor.  Inert  and  oxidative  decomposition  of  gaseous
TBBA were investigated at fixed temperatures in the range of 500–
800 °C. A wide range of VOCs and SVOCs were detected with a
particular focus on PBDD/Fs precursors; brominated phenols and
benzenes. Fig. 4 [77 –79] contrasts integrated yields of brominated
phenols  and  benzenes  under  inert  and  oxidative  conditions.  The
formation of PBDD/Fs precursors initiates at 500 °C and peaks at
∼650 °C. As it was the case in oxidative decomposition of powder-
like TBBA, the profiles of brominated phenols in the gas phase ox-
idative and inert degradation of TBBA were dominated by 2,4,6-
tribromophenol, and 2,4-/2,6-/dibromophenols molecules. Concen-
trations of bromophenols were consistently higher than those of
brominated benzenes; most notably under oxidative conditions. A
loss of Br atom from bromobenzenes molecules followed by oxy-
gen addition at the apparent radical sites affords a bromophenoxy
radical. Abstraction of an H atom by the phenoxy’s O concludes
the oxidative transformation of bromobenzenes into bromophenols
(Scheme 1) ).

In  addition  to  brominated  phenols  and  benzenes,  congeners
of  brominated  bisphenol  A,  brominated  biphenyls  (BBPs),  non-
brominated  dibenzofuran  and  benzofuran,  alkylated  bromoben-
zenes  and  bromophenols;  and  several  brominated  and  non-
brominated  PAHs  were  also  detected.  Fig.  5  shows  yields  of  se-
lected PAHs and dibenzofuran from the pyrolytic fragmentation of
gaseous  TBBA.  Concentration  of  oxygenated  species  were  higher
under  oxidative  conditions  if  contrasted  with  their  correspond-

ing yields under inert conditions. Likewise, fission of aromatic-Br
bonds  at  elevated  temperatures  increases  the  formation  of  non-
brominated compounds under both operational conditions. While
most of the reported products by Ortuño et al. [68] from the degra-
dation of powdered TBBA emerged also from the gas phase frag-
mentation of TBBA [77 –79] several salient differences in the yields
and detection of key species can be noted:

• The relative concentrations of bromophenols from the decom-
position  of  powdered-like  TBBA  were  one-fold  higher  than
analogous values sourced from the gas phase decomposition of
TBBA.

• In contrast to the absence of any bromobiphenyls isomers in
the  study  by  Ortuño  et  al.  [68] ;  concentrations  of  tribromo-
biphenyl isomers from the inert decomposition of gaseous TBBA
peaked at ∼450 ng/g around 700 °C.

• The  yields  of  benzofuran  and  brominated  naphthalene  were
considerably higher in the gas phase decomposition of TBBA in
reference to powdered-like TBBA.

These  differences  most  likely  originate  from  distinct  reaction
mechanisms underpinning decomposition of TBBA in its condensed
and vapour phases. The next two sections highlight major reaction
routes that prevail in the degradation of gaseous and powdered-
like TBBA.

The majority of studies on the thermal decomposition of pure
TBBA or TBBA-laden materials have aimed to investigate the possi-
ble formation of PBDD/Fs and bromophenols. Table 2 shows a sum-
mary of experimental investigations into the formation of PBDD/Fs
from thermal treatments of TBBA, and polymers laden with TBBA,
under various operational conditions. Several congeners of PBDD/Fs
exist  in  the  gas  phase,  albeit  in  the  ppm  range.  The  most  toxic
2,3,7,8-substituted  congeners  appear  at  a  ppb  level,  or  were  not
detected. Combustion of TBBA generally yields more PBDD/Fs rela-
tive to pyrolytic conditions. This is evident from data by Ortuño
et  al.  [68]  and  Thoma  et  al .  [80] ,  who  reported  total  yields  of
PBDD/Fs at 800 °C to be around 20 ppm and 25 ppb under oxida-
tive and pyrolytic conditions, respectively. In addition to the well-
established role of brominated phenols and benzenes as building

3.1.3. Mechanisms of thermal decomposition of pure TBBA

As discussed above, the decomposition of TBBA occurs in three
phases: a gas phase ( T ≥ 240 °C), a condensed phase upon melt-
ing of TBBA (240 °C ≤ T ≤ 450 °C), and during further charring of
residue if longer residence time permits. Prominent decomposition
reactions  in  the  condensed  medium  are  fundamentally  different
from the corresponding reactions prevailing in the gas phase. In
the latter, unimolecular-derived pathways dominate the decompo-
sition  of  TBBA,  whereas bimolecular  condensation-type reactions
are  expected  to  be  of  significant  importance  in  the  degradation
of  powdered-like  TBBA.  Based  on  evaporation  rates  reported  by
Marsanich et al. [63] and the IR spectrum measured by Luda et al.
[64] ,  TBBA  starts  to  evaporate  just  above  its  melting  point  (i.e.
180 °C). Thus, products reported at temperatures below 180 °C are
most likely to be produced from the decomposition of the evapo-
rated component of TBBA.

3.1.3.1. Mechanisms and products of pyrolysis and oxidation of pure
TBBA  in  the  gas  phase.  Altarawneh  and  Dlugogorski  [81]  con-
structed a detailed mechanism for pathways operating in the ini-
tial pyrolytic degradation of TBBA in the gas phase. Fission of a
C –CH
3  bond  leading  to  the  release  of  a  methyl  group  (pathway
A in Scheme 2 ) signifies the kinetically most feasible route with
a high-pressure rate constant fitted to k ( T ) = 2.0 × 10 10  exp ( −37
0 0 0/ T ) s −1 . Other potentially important channels constitute fissions
of aromatic C –Br bonds (pathway B) and isopropylidene (pathway
C) ( Scheme 2 ).

Saeed et al. [77 –79] carried out DFT calculations to illustrate re-
action mechanisms that account for the evolution of their TBBA’s
decomposition  products.  Fig.  6  depict  pathways  for  the  experi-
mentally observed major VOCs and SVOCs from pyrolysis of TBBA.
These pathways initiate by bimolecular reactions of TBBA with H
and Br atoms. Bimolecular reactions of H and Br atoms with TBBA
lead exclusively to the generation of H
2  and HBr, respectively. Br
atoms prefer to exclusively extract phenolic H-atoms. This in turn
indicates that any initially-formed Br atoms readily transform into
HBr molecules. HBr accounts for ∼50% bromine content in initial
TBBA samples. This ratio is in accord with other studies that re-
ported thermal decomposition of powdered TBBA.

Bisphenol A and its lower brominated congeners emerge from
facile  and  subsequent  H-induced  displacement  of  aromatic  Br
atoms.  These  reactions  require  enthalpic  activation  barriers  in
the  narrow  range  of  30–40 kJ  mol −1  and  ensue  via  considerable
exothermicity  of  ∼120 kJ  mol −1 .  Thus,  kinetics  as  well  as  ther-
modynamic aspects elucidate the appearance of brominated con-
geners  of  bisphenol  A  as  the  first  detected  decomposition  prod-

in the condensed phase decomposition of TBBA in Ortuño et al.
[68] experiment, is expected to promote a de novo synthesis route
of PBDD/Fs.

ucts at ∼500 °C. Self-expulsion of a methyl moiety opens up cor-
ridors for the generation of bromophenols molecules. In the en-
suing step, a 1,2-H shift followed by H migration into a para aro-
matic position produces initially a 2,6-dibromophenol (2,6-DBPh)
and 2,6-dibromo-4-vinylphenol molecules and phenolic-type radi-
cals ( Scheme 3 ).

Reactions of phenolic-type radicals with H/CH

3 /Br radical pool
produce a wide spectra of bromophenols and their alkylated con-
geners.  Abstraction  of  a  phenolic’s  H  by  any  radical  species  in
the reaction medium produces phenoxy radicals. Unimolecular de-
composition of phenoxy radicals occurs via the well-known ring
contraction/CO mechanism that generates cyclopentadiene radicals.
The latter constitute the commonly discussed building blocks for
PAHs. In this regard, naphthene from decomposition of TBBA most
likely arises from the self-condensation of cyclopentadiene as doc-
umented by Mebel et al. [82] .

3.1.3. Decomposition of pure TBBA in the condensed medium

The majority of investigations describe TBBA decomposition in
its  melting  phase  using  gas  phase-like  reactions  [61]  similar  to
those described in Fig. 6 . Marongiu et al. [83] presented a detailed
mechanistic study that accounted for the degradation of TBBA in
a condensed medium. Their mechanism combined gas phase re-

actions and key mechanistic steps governing the decomposition of
aqueous polymers [84] . Fig. 7 provides a qualitative description of
reaction networks and processes encountered in the thermal de-
composition of powdered-like TBBA. In this mechanism, several re-
action categories control the decomposition of TBBA:

• Elimination of HBr : Release of HBr/Br leads to the formation of
lower brominated bisphenol A derivatives through a complex C-
Br fission mechanism and is the most important initiation reac-
tion. Loss of HBr could occur via different modes, most notably
through  intramolecular  H  migration  from  phenolic’H  or  bi-
molecular condensation reactions involving molecule/molecule,
molecule/radical, and radical/radical initiation reactions. Among
all  plausible  HBr/Br  elimination  reactions,  keto-enolic  tau-
tomerisation resembles a rate-determining step for the initial
decomposition of TBBA ( Scheme 4 ).

The  most  important  initiation  reaction  in  the  gas  phase  (i.e.
3 )  is  insignificant  in  the  condensed  phase.
elimination  of  CH
As  shown  in  Fig.  7 ,  debromination  reactions  eventually  lead  to

placement  of  Br  atoms  with  phenolic‘H  atoms  in  a  process  that

leads to the formation of lower brominated isomers of bisphenol A
( Scheme 5 ).

Consecutive  HBr  elimination/condensation  reactions  produce
carbonaceous residue. HBr elimination from bimolecular reactions
involving  bromophenols  and/or  bromophenoxy  radicals  proceeds
via considerably endothermic reactions when occurring in the gas
phase [81] . If HBr elimination/condensation reactions occur read-
ily  in  the  aqueous  medium,  this  suggests  that  the  energetic  re-
quirements for this process in the condensed phase differ signif-
icantly from corresponding values in the gas phase. The presence

of trapped TBBA-like structures in the condensed medium (and in
the residue) might entail a steric hindrance between C –Br and O –H
bonds, thereby facilitating the expulsion of HBr. The absence of any
residue  from  pyrolysis  of  nonbrominated  bisphenol  A  highlights
the importance of HBr elimination in the formation of char dur-
ing pyrolysis of TBBA [64] .

In a pyrolytic environment, abundant H atoms selectively ab-
stract Br atoms and occupy the resulting radical site. This process
provides another route for the formation of lower brominated iso-
mers of bisphenol A ( Scheme 6 ).

bromophenols  above  300  °C  form  fissions  of  isopropylidene
linkages through different reactions ( Scheme 7 ).

Detection  of  2,6-dibromophenol  as  the  most  abundant  bro-
mophenol congener supports the fission of isopropylidene bridges
as being the most direct and important corridor for TBBA decom-
position. What remains unclear is to what extent such reactions
happen in the gas phase. The fact that ruptures of isopropylidene
linkages are minor channels in the gas phase [81] implies that scis-
sions of aromatic-(H
2 C bonds occur in the condensed phase via
a different pathway; possibly catalysed by neighbouring aromatic
rings. Release of bromophenols follows rupture of isopropylidene
bridges.

• Reactions  leading  to  evolution  of  soot:  The  well-known  HACA
mechanism [85] is the commonly discussed pathway in the for-
mation of soot from the pyrolysis and combustion of fuel (e.g.
hydrocarbon  liquid,  biomass,  coal,  etc.).  Initially-formed  PAHs
species continue to grow via polymerisations, coagulations and

surface reactions to form soot. Formation of several PAHs com-
pounds  from  TBBA  pyrolysis  [64]  contributes  partially  to  the
generation of residue. However, the largest fraction of residue
most  likely  originates  from  further  growth  of  heavy  compo-
nents formed by molecular/radical substitutive additions. C –C
and C –O bond fissions in these components release CO, alka-
nes  and  alkylbenzenes.  Further  decomposition  of  the  residue
may  occur  by  polymerisation  of  double  isopropylidene  bonds
and condensation of phenolic H bonds. Radical addition to dou-
ble  bonds  in  heavy  components  increases  the  rate  of  forma-
tion  of  larger  molecules,  i.e.  nucleolus  for  char.  As  explained
by  Marongiu  et  al .  [83] ,  the  formation  of  char  from  pyroly-
sis of TBBA should consider analogous process occurring dur-
ing  pyrolysis  of  heavy  distillation  residues,  namely,  diffusion-
controlled radical and effective collisions recombination.

The value of the pre-exponential A factor depends on the type of the specific reactants in the generic title reaction
(R1-R9). For instance, a loss of Br atom from the parent TBBA molecule (initiation reactions, R1) entails an A value
of 8 × 10 13
. The rate constant

neously with vaporisation through five consecutive global reactions
( Scheme 8 ).

Using an optimisation procedure to model the experimentally-
observed weight losses produces apparent kinetic parameters for
global reactions R1–R5. Font et al. [86] simplified the detailed ki-
netic  model  of  Marongiu  et  al.  [83]  to  consider  only  initiation
and  primary  recombination  reactions.  In  this  simplified  mecha-
nistic model, the five global reactions covered by the correlation
model describe decomposition behaviour after the growth of the
first heavy molecules (i.e. more than 30 carbon atoms). The main
shortcoming  of  Font  et  al.  [86]  model  is  that  is  only  accounts
for TBBA weight loss, vaporisation rate and the average molecular
weight of the evolved volatiles. In this regard, a more robust ki-
netic model of TBBA thermal decomposition would be expected to
account quantitatively for the formation of all decomposition prod-
ucts, most notably those reported recently by Ortuño et al. [68] .

3.1.5. Decomposition of polymeric materials laden with TBBA

Co-pyrolysis of TBBA with polymeric constituents can simulate
real scenarios relevant to accidental fires involving materials laden
with TBBA, or their thermally-based recycling processes. Studies on
the  pyrolysis  of  TBBA-containing  polymers  have  investigated  the
degradation behaviour of four structural categories, namely, neat
non-brominated polymers, neat brominated polymers, modified (or
hardened) non-brominated polymers, and modified (or hardened)
brominated  polymers.  In  general,  the  presence  of  TBBA  units  in
phenolic materials impairs their thermodynamic stability and in-
creases  the  amount  of  residue  relative  to  non-brominated  poly-
mers.  Initial  steps  in  the  weight  loss  curves  of  many  polymers
treated with TBBA mainly correspond to the evaporation of their
TBBA content. Decomposition behaviour of TBBA-treated polymers
is dependent on the type of polymeric building block present (i.e.
epoxy, phenol, etc.) and the presence of hardening agents (amine
groups, aliphatic anhydride, etc.). Overall, the impact of polymers
on the decomposition behaviour of BFRs is far more complex than
the previously assumed role of merely serving as hydrogen a donor
[35] . For instance, the chemical fixation of TBBA in epoxy resins
favours direct HBr elimination over the release of phenolic com-
pounds that generally prevails in phenolic-TBBA polymers in which
TBBA is not chemically bounded [87] . The homologue of PBDD/Fs
from thermal decomposition of BFRs-containing polymers is con-
siderably shifted toward lower brominated congeners with a no-
ticeable enhancement of the PBDFs yield. The shift toward lower
brominated congeners originates from facile displacements of aro-
matic Br atoms by abundant H atoms [81] . However, the enchant-
ment in the yields of PBDFs deserves a careful mechanistic anal-
ysis. Decomposition of polymers proceeds in a hydrogen-rich en-
vironment. Altarawneh et al. [88] illustrated via DFT calculations

Fig. 8.  Mass yield (% initial sample weight of TBBA) of major brominated decom-
position products of TBBA, theoretical predicted values are sourced from reference
[68] , while experimental values are taken from reference [62] .

Marongiu  et  al.  [83] ,  and  a  correlational  and  simplified  mecha-
nistic  model  by  Font  et  al.  [86] .  The  comprehensive  model  by
Marongiu  et  al.  [83]  incorporates  about  60  components  (real
and lumped molecules/radicals) and 900 reactions. Validating this
model  against  experimental  data  obtained  under  isothermal  and
dynamic TGA runs satisfactorily reproduces many aspects of TBBA
degradation and vaporisation, including overall decay of TBBA, rel-
ative yields of HBr and carbonaceous residues, evaporation rates of
TBBA, and relative distributions of gas phase products (bromophe-
nols and brominated isomers of bisphenol A). Reaction rate con-
stants in this model are mainly based on matching gas phase re-
actions while taking into account their inversion or transposition
into  the  liquid  phase.  In  this  approach,  activation  energies  ( E a )
values  are  corrected  (i.e.  lowered)  by  subtracting  the  condensa-
tion heats of reactants. Correction in values of pre-exponential A
factors  reflects  the  loss  of  degree  of  freedoms  (i.e.  translational
and rotational contributions) from a gas phase molecule to a con-
densed  phase.  Reaction  rate  constants  for  char  formation  utilise
analogous  values  in  the  mechanism  for  PVC  [84] .  Table  3  sum-
marises  the  kinetic  parameters  of  Marongiu  et  al.’s  model  [83] .
Figs. 1 and 8 compare modelled and experimentally-observed val-
ues of overall TBBA decay and the relative mass yields of major
products.

The correlation model of Font et al. [86] fits the characteristics
of TBBA weight loss, obtained by several isothermal and dynamic
TGA runs, to a unique set of kinetic parameters. The underlying
idea behind this model is that TBBA decomposition occurs simulta-

a  mechanism  for  the  H-induced  conversion  of  non-substituted
dibenzo- p -dioxin (DD) into dibenzofuran (DF) ( Scheme 9 ).

Addition  of  an  H  atom  at  the  C –O  bridge  in  the  dibenzo-
p- dioxin  molecule  weakens  this  bond  and  facilitates  subse-
quent  elimination  of  a  hydroxyl  radical  leading  to  the  forma-
tion  of  a  dibenzofuran  molecule.  The  overall  activation  energy
for  this  mechanism  amounts  to  74 kJ  mol −1 .  Thus,  a  similar
DD + H → DF + OH conversion mechanism may operate during
the highly reducing conditions encountered in the thermal decom-
position of BFRs.

Epoxy and phenol resins are the most widely employed plastics

in electric and electronic equipment [89] ( Scheme 10 ).

Results from an interesting study by Grause et al. [70] on the
pyrolysis  of  phenolic  resin-containing  TBBA  highlighted  the  re-
markable differences in the decomposition behaviour of pure TBBA
and phenolic resins treated with TBBA:

• Pyrolysis  of  phenolic  resin  laden  with  TBBA  does  not  pro-
duce brominated or non-brominated congeners of bisphenol A.
On  the  contrary,  these  compounds  account  for  ∼25%  of  to-
tal brominated products produced from decomposition of pure
TBBA [68] . A plausible explanation is that TBBA exists as a co-
monomer in phenolic resins, and thus it is trapped in the poly-
meric material. This has the potential to shut down direct evap-
oration as a route for the emission of TBBA and its other lower
brominated isomers.

• Decomposition  of  pure  TBBA  produces  higher  yields  of  bro-
mophenols (as mass fraction relative to TBBA initial mass) than
phenolic  resins  containing  TBBA.  Pyrolysis  of  polymers  pro-
duces a hydrogen-rich environment. Abundant H atoms prefer-
entially abstract bromine atoms, thereby lowering total yields
of higher brominated phenols congeners, as Scheme 11 shows.

226

Scheme 11.

• In the pyrolysis of pure TBBA, ∼55% of the initial bromine con-
tent transforms into HBr. Formation of HBr arises from initial H
migration from the OH group and, most importantly, through
bimolecular  condensation  reactions  ( Fig.  7 ).  Emission  of  HBr
from  the  thermal  degradation  of  phenolic-resin  treated  with
TBBA contributes approximately 87% of the initial bromine con-
tent and occurs within two main temperature intervals: either
below or above 400 °C. Nearly 50% of HBr is released in the
first temperature interval, while the remaining 37% is emitted
between 400 and 700 °C [70] . Emission of HBr in the first inter-
val corresponds to the decomposition of TBBA. Decomposition
of phenolic resins commences above 400 °C and thus, forma-
tion of HBr in the higher temperature interval most likely stems
from Br abstraction by H radicals. The latter are produced from
the fragmentation of phenolic resins.

• Similar  to  the  decomposition  of  free  TBBA,  the  formation  of
brominated  aromatics  from  the  pyrolysis  of  phenolic  resins
laden with TBBA completes at 370–400 °C.

Diglycidyl ether bisphenol A (DGEBA) and diglycidyl ether tetra-
bromobisphenol  A  (DGETBBA)  epoxy  resins  constitute  the  basic

building blocks of TBBA-epoxy types (the epoxy group
riences rapid enolisation into a C –OH moiety) ( Scheme 12 ).

expe-

Quan et al. [69] and Luda et al. [90 –92] present two distinct
weight  loss  curves  for  the  decomposition  of  DGETBBA  based  on
a  heating  rate  of  10  °C  min −1 .  Quan  et  al.  [69]  found  that  the
degradation curve of DGETBBA proceeds with one stage of weight
loss between 270 and 400 °C, leaving a solid residue equal to 64%
of  the  original  mass.  A  faster  TGA  heating  rate  of  DGETBBA  of
20 °C min −1 reduces the amount of residue to 17% [90] . Barontini
et al. [66] also highlighted the dependence of residues on heating.
Faster heating rates produced lower amounts of residues under ox-
idative and pyrolytic operating conditions.

Decomposition of DGEBA and DGETBBA commences at 255 °C
and 274 °C, respectively. Evaporation of TBBA and bisphenol A from
pyrolysis of both DGEBA and DGETBBA suggests fission of O –CH
2 -
bonds (i.e., driven by a chemical reaction), the occurrence of par-
allel bromination reactions, and a 1,4 H transfer from the hydroxyl
group to the O site [68] ( Scheme 13 ).

Products  of  DGETBBA  decomposition  span  all  species  evolved
from  pure  TBBA  pyrolysis,  i.e.  bromophenols,  bisphenol  A,  p -
isopropenylphenol and PBDD/Fs. Covalently-bonded and additively
incorporated TBBA in epoxy resins produce very similar homologue

profiles of PBDD/Fs [66] . In both cases, mono bromodibenzofurans
congeners dominate the isomer distributions of PBDD/Fs. The for-
mation of bromophenols from TBBA is not satirically hindered due
to the covalent fixation of TBBA in the epoxy backbone. The for-
mation of tribromphenols at a relatively low temperatures of about
310 °C may stem from loss of the end groups in brominated epoxy
oligomer ( Scheme 14 ).

Oxidative and pyrolytic decomposition of TBBA-epoxy entities
have  nearly  the  same  conversion  rate  of  bromine  into  HBr  (i.e.
57.1%  and  53.6%,  respectively)  [66] .  Along  the  same  line  of  en-
quiry, Kaya and Hacaloglu [93] found that thermal decomposition
of brominated epoxy resin produce three categories of products;
species  that  arises  from  the  fission  of  epoxy  linkages;  most  no-
tably, CH
3 , brominated isomers of bisphenol
3 COCH
A; and tribromphenols.

The  formation  of  minor  amounts  of  bromoethane  and  bro-
moacetone points out to a plausible attach of HBr on the epoxy
units in a process that also mediates the release of TBBA from the
epoxy resin (Scheme 15).

Brominated  epoxy  resins  often  incorporate  amine-containing
co-monomers  as  hardening  agents  [94] .  Cured  DGETBBA  with
4,4 (cid:7) -diaminodiphenyl represents one of the most widely deployed
epoxy resins in printed circuit boards [95] ( Scheme 16 ).

Weak allylic C –N bonds, and the property of the amine group as
being a good nucleophilic attacking group, combine to control the
initial  decomposition  of  nitrogen-cured  TBBA-based  epoxy  resins
[76] ( Scheme 17 ).

Further  degradation  of  brominated  epoxy  resins  cured  with
amine-containing compounds occurs via HBr addition through the
Hofmann–Martius reaction [96] ( Scheme 18 ).

Brominated epoxy resins cured with amine groups start to de-
compose at around 280 °C [76] , which is similar to that for pure
TBBA [68] . In contrast, degradation of non-brominated epoxy resins
commences at ∼380 °C. The presence of N –C bonds in both bromi-
nated and non-brominated adducts denotes that reactions derived
by HBr (nucleophilic addition) explain the steep decomposition of
brominated  epoxy  resins  at  a  lower  temperature  in  reference  to
non-brominated epoxy resins. The HBr-catalysed decomposition of
epoxy resins has serious implications for the safe pyrolytic recy-
cling of TBBA-containing wastes and should receive prior consider-
ation.

The  degradation  of  cured  brominated  epoxy  ester  with  ph-
thalic anhydride [80] shares very similar characteristics with the
analogous  decomposition  of  brominated  amine  hardened  epox-
ies  [90 , 91] .  In  comparison  with  non-brominated  phthalic  anhy-
dride epoxy, its brominated counterpart loses weight more steeply
at  temperatures  higher  than  340  °C,  manifesting  the  effect  of
bromine  content  in  deriving  thermal  instability  as  the  tempera-
ture increases. Unimolecular re-arrangements of the oxirane ring
and  elimination  of  a  glycidyl  group  starts  the  decomposition  of
phthalic anhydride  epoxy  [90 , 91] .  It  will  be  essential  to  develop
kinetic models of the decomposition of TBBA-laden polymers.

The  study  also  addressed  reactions  of  TBBA  pyrolysates  with
nanoparticles  of  Fe
3 .  Metal-oxygen  bonds  act  as  a  Lewis-acid
pair facilitating dehydrohalogenating reactions. De-bromination of
brominated alkanes and alkenes over Fe
3 largely occur via disso-
ciate addition (i.e., surface assisted fission of the C-Br bond) rather
than by elimination of H and Br atoms ( Scheme 20 ).

2 O

Adding  metal  oxides  significantly  changes  the  decomposition
profile of pure TBBA and shifts the onset temperature of decom-
position to a lower temperature [103] . While weight loss curve of
the decomposition of TBBA in TGA-DSC experiments exhibited two
endothermic events, the TBBA-EAFD mixture displays an exother-
mic  event  that  accompanies  the  evaporation  of  metal  halides.  It
has been shown recently that evaporation of metal bromides could
be supressed by addition of calcium hydroxide [87] . This has re-
sulted in the increase of elemental metals in the ash residue.

Co-pyrolysis  of  TBBA  with  metal  oxides  also  greatly  alters
bromine distribution in reference to pyrolysis of pure TBBA. Fig. 9
compares bromination speciation for different types and loads of
metal  oxide  [99] .  CaO  displays the  highest  capacity  of  capturing
bromine  in  the  residue.  XRD  measurements  prove  that  bromine
in TBBA is converted into metal bromides and oxybromides [103] .
Further reduction of metal oxides into metallic species is accom-
panied by enhanced CO
2 yield. A rise in concentrations of benzene
suggests that metal oxides abstract a Br atom, either from the orig-
inal TBBA or any other brominated species. The Deacon reaction
may contribute to the reduction in HBr concentrations; however,
2 were not reported to support this
online FTIR measurements of Br
hypothesis.

Although metal oxides perform as HBr scavengers, they could
potentially promote the formation of PBDD/Fs. It was shown that
3  facilitates  conversion  of  bromophenol  into  bromophenoxy
Fe
and OH-phenyl type radicals [102] ; a step that is central in for-
mation of PBDD/Fs ( Scheme 21 ).

2 O

As a consequence, the overall merit of deploying metal oxides
as an abatement technology for bromine emissions during thermal
treatment of TBBA warrants further investigation. To the best of

Scheme 19.

3.1.6. Fixation of Br content in TBBA via introducing metal oxides

Interest in studying the effects of metal oxides on the thermal
decomposition of TBBA originates from their profound capacity to
act  as  halogen  absorbers  or  fixers  [97 –100] .  In  this  regard,  co-
pyrolysis of TBBA with electric arc furnace dust (EAFD) has been
extensively investigated as a promising approach for an environ-
mentally sustainable recycling approach for metal oxides in EAFD
and the bromine content in TBBA. EAFD mainly consists of iron and
zinc  oxides,  with  a  trace  load  of  lead  and  calcium  oxides  [101] .
Al-Harahsheh et al. [38] found that EAFD captures most of emit-
ted HBr from decomposition of TBBA in the form of volatile metal
bromides. Gaseous HBr start to appear only after 400 °C at a con-
siderably less quantities if contrasted with the decomposition of
pure  TBBA.  The  effective  fixation  of  HBr  by  EAFD  stems  from  a
very  facile  nature  for  dissociative  adsorption  of  HBr  over  metal-
oxygen bonds in EAFD. Altarawneh et al. [102] found that catalytic-
3 takes place via an activation en-
assisted rupture of HBr by Fe
ergy of only 30 kJ mol −1 . Metal oxides-assisted decomposition of
TBBA  most  likely  commences via fission of  aromatic C-Br  bonds
over metal’s cations. When bromobenzene is utilized as a model
3 -assisted rupture of aromatic
for TBBA; activation barrier for Fe
C-Br bond amounts to 47 kJ mol −1 ( Scheme 19 ).

oxides did not attempt to pinpoint potential formation of PBDD/Fs.

3.2. Thermal decomposition of HBCDs

Depending on the achiral positioning of bromine atoms with re-
spect to the C
12 ring, there exist 16 theoretically possible stereoiso-
mers  of  HBCDs  [104] .  Among  these,  the  labelled  α-,  β-  and
γ -HBCD  enantiomers  dominate  all  technical  mixtures  of  HBCDs
[105] :

Melting temperatures for these three isomers are reported to
be 172 °C, 169 °C and 209 °C, respectively [106] . Samples of HBCDs
with  different  isomeric  compositions  exhibit  very  similar  degra-
dation profiles. Decomposition occurs mainly in the narrow tem-
perature range of 230–270 °C [107] . This observation could be ex-
plained in view of a rapid equilibrium established between isomers
of HBCDs at elevated temperatures.

Earlier studies on the thermal decomposition of HBCDs focused
on  its  thermal  stability  and  provided  very  similar  weight  loss
curves [108 –110] . Isothermal TGA runs indicated that the decom-
position  of  HBCDs  commences  at  240  °C,  after  which  a  HBCD’s
ring undergoes dramatic decomposition in one stage, assuming an
S  shape  [109 , 110] .  This  in  turn  suggests  that  the  overall  decom-
position of HBCDs is governed by an autocatalytic process derived
from initially formed radical species. Reported apparent activation
energy  for  the  overall  decomposition  of  HBCDs  is  in  the  range
90–120 kJ mol −1 . These estimates are considerably lower than the
activation  energies  required  for  the  unimolecular  elimination  of
HBr from brominated gas phase linear alkanes, i.e. ∼240 kJ mol −1
[53] .  This  indicates  that  the  first  HBr  elimination  is  not  a  rate-
determining step in the overall decomposition of HBCDs and sup-
ports the occurrence of an autocatalytic sustained reaction chain.
However, it is worthwhile noting that the literature does not pro-
vide kinetics or thermochemical data on HBr loss from brominated
cycloalkanes for comparison.

At  a  constant  heating  rate  of  10  °C  min −1 ,  rapid  decomposi-
tion  of  HBCD  consumes  94%  of  its  initial  content  [107] .  Formed
HBr  accounts  for  ∼73%  of  the  initial  bromine  load.  The  absence
of  data  on  evolved  Br
2  impedes  attempts  to  provide  conclusive
evidence  regarding  its  formation.  GC/MS  analysis  of  the  pyroly-
sis residue identifies a wide range of brominated/non-brominated
C
12 products. Detected species include lower brominated con-
geners  of  cyclododecadiene,  brominated  biphenyls,  brominated
methyl-naphthalene and brominated cyclododecatriene. Detection
of  these  products  by  Barontini  et  al.  [107 , 111]  provides  an  ex-
perimental verification of the decomposition mechanism originally

proposed by Larsen and Ecker [109,110] . This mechanism mainly
involves successive dehydrobromination reactions, unimolecular ar-
rangement,  C –C  bond  breakage  reactions,  Diels–Alder  reactions,
and  radical-derived  reactions.  The  occurrence  of  these  reactions
implies that intramolecular reactions hold more importance than
intermolecular reactions. Formation of mono-, di- and tri- bromi-
nated  biphenyls  and  alkyl  naphthalene  exclusively  suggests  that
these compounds come from tetrabromocyclododecadiene (TBCD).
The latter forms after three subsequent HBr elimination reactions
from the parent HBCD. Fig. 10 portrays an overall mechanism for
the  decomposition  of  HBCDs.  Note  that  this  mechanism  has  no
analogous mechanistic validation with quantum chemical calcula-
tions. Constructing a simplified kinetic model based on global re-
action steps will be instrumental in providing further insight into
HBCD decomposition. Introducing oxygen does not affect the de-
composition behaviour of HBCD nor does it influence the product
profiles [106 , 109 , 110] . On the other hand, the presence of impuri-
ties in HBCDs samples seems to greatly enhance its thermal de-
composition.

Studies on the thermal decomposition of HBCDs point out that
two important aspects require further investigation: the effect of
polymeric  matrices  and  the  contribution  of  a  gas  phase  decom-
position  route.  As  the  overall  degradation  of  HBCDs  is  governed
by an autocatalytic process, the presence of C x H y  radical species
may potentially cause the decomposition of HBCDs to commence
prior  to  its  melting.  This  would  have  important  implications  for
the operational requirements of safe HBCD deployment, as well as
for its thermal recycling. All pyrolysis studies on HBCDs demon-
strate that HBCDs decomposition occurs in one stage, correspond-
ing to its degradation in the aqueous phase. Nevertheless, HBCDs
share a defining physical feature with VOCs [112] . HBCDs can emit
to the atmosphere from treated objects at ambient temperatures,
with  a  reported  40-fold  increase  when  the  temperature  rises  to
80 °C [113] . The latter temperature could easily be reached within
a  landfill,  due  to  heat  release  by  biodegradation  [114] .  Address-
ing decomposition of HBCDs in the gas phase will help in form-

ing a more robust understanding of its fate and transformation at
ambient-like conditions.

Oxidation  of  pure  HBCDs  does  not  yield  any  congeners  of
PBDD/Fs.  On  the  contrary,  controlled  incineration  of  polystyrene
and extruded polystyrene with HBCD in a pilot-scale plant resulted
in the formation of 0.028 ng g −1 of PBDD/Fs [115] . Nonetheless, ad-
dition  of  HBCDs  did  not  change  the  yield  or  pattern  of  formed
PBDD/Fs, suggesting that these brominated pollutants form from
the breakdown of the polymeric constituents, via de novo synthe-
sis rather than through a precursor pathway. However, as the next
section illustrates brominated biphenyls (major products of HBCDs
pyrolysis), act as building blocks for PBDFs.

3.3. Thermal decomposition of polybrominated diphenyl ethers
(PBDEs) and polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs)

Early  studies  on  the  thermal  decomposition  of  BFRs  (1970s–
1990s) focused mainly on the degradation of PBDEs and PBBs in
laboratory-scale  pyrolysis  experiments  [74 , 116 –122] .  Surprisingly,
there are no recent studies on pyrolysis of combustion of neat PBBs
or articles laden with PBBs. Investigated aspects in the aforemen-
tioned early studies included (1) decomposition behaviour of pure
PBDEs and PBBs, (2) the effect of polymeric materials, (3) potential
for the formation of PBDD/Fs, and (4) degradation during extrusion

(i.e., compounding with polymers). Table 4 summarises the opera-
tional conditions used in these studies, the major decomposition
products, and associated PBDD/Fs emission profiles.

3.3.1. Degradation of pure PBDEs

Starting  with  the  decomposition  of  pure  PBDEs,  the  highest
yields  of  PBDD/Fs  under  condensed  phase  conditions  occur  at
around  600  °C,  in  total  yields  of  up  to  ∼10%  [121] .  This  tem-
perature  coincides  with  the  analogous  optimal  range  for  forma-
tion  of  PBDD/Fs  during  PBDE  pyrolysis  in  a  gas  phase  process,
i.e. 60 0–70 0 °C [118] . Luijk et al. [123] suggest PBDD/Fs formation
is a combination between homogenous and heterogeneous path-
ways. Altarawneh and Dlugogorski [124] have recently constructed
a gas phase mechanism for the synthesis of PBDD/Fs from PBDEs.
Fig. 11 a depicts the principal pathways of this mechanism (based
on 2,2 (cid:7) -dibromodiphenyl ether as a representative compound for
the PBDEs family). Central to these pathways is abstraction of an
ortho H/Br substituent, followed by addition of an oxygen molecule
to the vacant radical site. As Fig. 11 a depicts, the formed peroxy
adduct  (ROO . )  evolves  in  a  very  exothermic  and  complex  corri-
dor to yield PBDDs congeners. DFT molecular modelling predicts
that  the  overall  reaction  shown  in  Scheme  22  is  exothermic  by
242 kJ mol −1 , with a net activation energy of 49 kJ mol −1 residing
below the separated initial reactants.

(reprinted from [131] with permission of Elsevier). Values in bracket and bold denote reaction and activation enthalpies at 25 °C in kJ mol −1

, respectively.

Abstraction of an ortho H/Br atom by radicals abundant in the
combustion/pyrolysis medium initiates the formation of PBDFs. A
direct C –C bridging produce PBDFs according to Scheme 23.

Reactions comprising this mechanism have substantially lower
energy requirements than previously suggested pathways by We-
ber and Kuch [35] , namely, direct unimolecular elimination of HBr
(340 kJ  mol −1  at  298.15 K),  and  direct  fission  of  ether  linkages

(337 kJ mol −1 at 298.15 K). Clearly, the high energy barrier for di-
rect elimination of HBr indicates that this route is unlikely to con-
tribute in the formation of PBDFs.

The facile nature of the mechanism shown in Fig. 11 a supports
the experimentally detected high yield of PBDD/Fs from PBDE ox-
idative decomposition. Altarawneh and Dlugogorski [124] demon-
strate  that  the  degree  of  bromination  does  not  alter  calculated

thermochemical  and  kinetics  parameters,  and  that  all  congeners
of  PBDEs  form  PBDD/Fs  at  very  comparable  rates.  However,  this
finding  seem  to  contradicts  with  the  experimental  observation
[117] that lower brominated PBDEs (e.g. Penta-BDE) form higher
yields of PBDD/Fs when contrasted with the yield of PBDD/Fs from
higher  brominated  diphenyl  ether  (e.g.  Octa-BDE).  To  provide  a
plausible explanation, it was suggested that HBr elimination (i.e.
the first step in conversion of PBDEs into PBDD/Fs) becomes more
sterically hindered as the degree of bromination increases [125] . As
illustrated, a high energy barrier is expected to shut down the HBr
elimination channel. We envisage that a low yield of PBDD/Fs from
the higher brominated congeners of diphenyl ether is attributed to
the low vapour pressure of the latter [126] . A higher bromination
degree of congeners of diphenyl ether entails their dominant solid
phase partitioning. For this reason, gas phase route may not be ap-
plicable for the higher brominated congeners of diphenyl ethers.

If  formation  of  PBDD/Fs  occurs  via  the  mechanism  presented
in Fig. 11 a, the low yield of PBDD/Fs from higher brominated PB-
DEs merits further clarification. A plausible explanation might par-
tially originate from the inverse relationship between PBDEs iso-
mer  vapour  pressures  and  bromination  degree  [126] .  At  25  °C,
the vapour pressure for a Penta-BDE is two orders of magnitude
higher than for a Hepta-BDE congener. Consequently, it is sensi-
ble to assume that the evaporation of PBDEs decreases consider-
ably with increasing degrees of bromination. In other words, the
potential for PBDEs congeners to undergo oxidative transformation
into PBDD/Fs is influenced by their evaporation rates. It will be in-
formative to test this argument experimentally by measuring the
PBDD/Fs  yields  of  comparable  concentrations  of  gaseous  PBDEs,
with different degrees and patterns of bromination, at the same
temperature.

3.3.2. Effects of polymers on the generation of PBDD/Fs from PBDEs

Four observations demonstrate the effects of polymeric materi-
als on the formation of PBDD/Fs produced by the decomposition of
PBDEs-laden polymeric materials, compared with those produced
from pure PBDEs [117] :

• Reduction in the optimal temperature window for PBDFs for-

mation, from ∼600 °C to 350–400 °C.

• Profound selectivity toward PBDFs formation. Luijk et al. [117] :
explained that addition of polymeric materials to pure PBDEs
results in a 7-fold increase in the formation of PBDFs.

• Significant enhancement of total PBDFs yield.
• Shifting  homologue  patterns  toward  lower  brominated  con-

geners.

Fig. 12 [73] contrasts the temperature profiles for PBDFs formed
from pure PBDEs (in a condensed phase) with the profiles of var-
ious PBDE-containing polymer blends (polybutylene terephthalate:

Fig.  12.  Comparison  of  temperature  profiles  for  the  formation  of  PBDFs  from

PBT). The underlying mechanism, in which polymeric materials in-
crease  the  rate  at  which  PBDFs  is  formed  from  PBDEs,  is  still  a
matter of discussion. As Scheme 9 , generated H atoms for degra-
dation  of  polymers  could  readily  convert  dibenzo- p -dioxin  into
dibenzofuran. However, other plausible mechanisms might also op-
erate  in  the  selective  formation  of  PBDFs  from  PBDE-containing
polymer blends. It is suggested that hydrogen atoms in the con-
densed  phase  replace  bromine  atoms  via  hydrogen/bromine  ex-
change reactions, leading to lower brominated congeners of PBDEs
[72] . This is followed by evaporation of PBDEs isomers. Similarly,
Luijk  et  al.  [123]  suggested  that  PBDEs  abstract  hydrogen  atoms
from polymeric chains during their melting phase; a process which
also shifts the homologue profile toward lower brominated con-
geners.

As  demonstrated  in  the  preceding  section,  loss  of  ortho  H/Br
substituents  from  PBDEs  isomers  initiates  their  simple  conver-
sion  into  PBDFs.  Pyrolysis  or  oxidation  of  polymers  proceeds
in  a  hydrogen-rich  environment.  Hydrogen  atoms  selectively  ab-
stract aromatic Br atoms via a trivial reaction barrier (37 mol −1 )
[124] ( Scheme 24).

In the condensed phase, intramolecular movement could lead
to  the  expulsion  of  a  Br  atom  or  a  unimolecular  loss  of  HBr
molecule. Reactions of PBDEs with H atoms could potentially gen-
erate potent building blocks for the formation of PBDD/Fs [124] .

duces  a  brominated  phenoxy  radical  and  a  brominated  benzene
molecule with an overall activation enthalpy of only 40 kJ mol −1
( Scheme 25).

Indeed, the absence of any PBDDs congeners from the pyrol-
ysis of pure PBDEs or polymer-containing PBDEs serves as a ver-
ification  of  for  the  importance  of  this  H-derived  splitting  of  the
ether  linkage  in  forming  PBDDs  [73] .  It  is  anticipated  that  car-
rying  out  a  thermolysis  study  on  PBDEs  under  highly  reducing
conditions  would  be  instrumental  in  revealing  the  extent  of  H-
induced splitting and their potential importance in forming PBDDs
phenoxy-type precursors. The analogous breakage of ether linkages
by an ipso addition of Br atoms has been confirmed experimentally
[127] and theoretically [124] . The Br-induced fission of the ether
linkages requires a modest activation enthalpy of ∼100 kJ mol −1 .

The observed debromination of PBDEs by polymeric materials
seems to overlap with the functionality of BFRs in scavenging the
propagating H/Br radicals [72] . For example, Br atoms released dur-
ing  the  scavenging  process  readily  abstract  an  aromatic  H  atom
[124] . Brauman and Chen [128] explained that, the decomposition
of hydrocarbon chains initiates an autocatalytic debromination of
PBDEs, i.e. the first step in transforming PBDDs into PBDFs . It will
be interesting to explore the mechanisms of PBDEs and polymeric
hydrocarbon chain interactions under carefully tailored operational
conditions of PBDEs/polymers ratios in the input feed. One of the
most intriguing unanswered questions in this regard is whether–
C x H y - chains can mediate ring-closure reactions toward PBDFs, in
addition to their established role in the debromination process.

All  of  the  aforementioned  studies  were  carried  out  in
laboratory-scale  reactors  (i.e.  quartz  tubes).  The  study  by  Sakai
et  al.  [129]  is  perhaps  the  only  investigation  reporting  levels  of
PBDD/Fs  produced  from  PBDDEs  and  polymer-containing  PBDEs
under combustion-like conditions. The broad conclusion is that ad-
equate, well-controlled combustion conditions greatly reduce the
concentrations of PBDEs and PBDD/Fs. However, there are no stud-
ies of the behaviour of PBDEs or PBDE-laden polymers under real
fire scenarios.

3.3.3. Decomposition of polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs)

Studies on the thermal decomposition of PBBs are very limited.
The  oxidation  of  2,2 (cid:7) ,4.4 (cid:7) ,5,5 (cid:7) -hexabromobiphenyl  (the  so-called
FireMaster FF-1) at 380–400 °C in open and closed glass tubes pro-
duces 40 ppm Tetra-BDFs (TBDFs) and 4 ppm Penta-BDFs, respec-
tively [130] . TBDF emerged as the dominant product. Formation of
TBDFs from FireMaster FF-1 most likely proceed via a direct ox-
idation mechanism that converts PBBs into PBDFs through a no-
ticeably exothermic pathway [131] . Fig. 11 b features the most im-
2 -initiated mechanism. In an analogy to
portant reactions in this O
the mechanism governing the formation of PBDDs from PBDEs, this
mechanism involves a unimolecular arrangement of the initially-
formed RO
2 adduct leading to the formation of PBDFs. Other previ-
ously suggested mechanisms by Weber and Kuch [35] are deemed
to be unfeasible from a mechanistic point of view (insertion of O
2
into the structure of PBBs) or are energetically prohibited (fission
of C –C bridge; 495 kJ mol −1 ). The O
2 insertion route proposed by
Weber  and  Kuch  [35]  entails  the  splitting  of  the  O = O  bond  in
the triplet oxygen molecule; ∼500 kJ mol −1 . Clearly, formation of
2 insertion
PBDFs at temperatures as low as 400 °C rules out the O

route. Furthermore, the absence of any PBDDs compounds indicate
two focal points:

• A second O insertion mechanism in the skeleton of PBDFs did

not operate.

• Formation  of  PBDFs  does  not  involve  brominated  phenols,  as

the later most likely form PBDDs as well.

In spite of pure pyrolytic conditions, the co-pyrolysis of PBBs
with  polybutylene  terephthalate  (PBT)  polymers  produces  PBDFs
congeners  within  10 ppm  concentration  in  the  temperature  win-
dow 40 0–70 0 °C, without detection of any PBDDs congeners [72] .
The source of oxygen in formed PBDFs must originate from oxy-
gen  contained  in  the  PBT  polymer.  Introducing  oxygen  increases
concentrations of PBDFs up to 70 ppm for certain PBDFs isomers.
Concentrations of PBDDs under oxidative conditions are lower than
those of PBDFs by at least two orders of magnitude [72] . Addition
of  PBBs  does  not  exert  any  influence  on  the  decomposition  be-
haviour of pure polybutylene terephthalate. Considering that poly-
butylene terephthalate starts to melt at 380 °C, and formation of
PBDD/Fs peaks at 600 °C, two important pivotal points can be con-
cluded:

• Evaporation of PBBs occurs during the polymer’s breakdown in

the condensed phase.

• Formation of PBDFs from PBBs follows a gas phase mechanism;
i.e. the oxidative transformation mechanism shown in Fig. 11 b.

Concentrations of PBBs can still be detected in the environment
decades  after  their  use  and  production  was  prohibited.  Uncon-
trolled burning or incineration of materials laden with PBBs is an
ongoing environmental and health burden. Owing to their simple
structure, PBBs could potentially form combustion and pyrolysis of
any aromatic-containing BFRs. Indeed, nonbrominted biphenyl was
detected  from  thermal  decomposition  of  TBBA  in  the  gas  phase
[77] . Isomers of PBBs may have formed but at a lower yield than
the detection limits in Saeed et al. experiment [77] . Biphenyl con-
stitutes a major product from pyrolysis of benzene [132] and other
simple aromatic compounds. In other words, PBBs could form as
unwanted by-products from combustion/pyrolysis of any aromatic-
containing fuels if bromine is present. In this regard, thermal treat-
ment of the polymers in e-waste may provide a perfect recipe for
the synthesis of PBBs based on the well-known Ullmann reaction
[133] in which abundant copper species act as potent catalysis in
the formation of the aryl-aryl bond.

Most of the early experimental studies (shown in Table 4 ) on
thermal  decomposition  of  PBDEs  and  PBBs  were  carried  out  in
quartz minivilas or tube reactors. The use of quartz in these exper-
iments may invoke significant surface effects especially at temper-
atures below 600 °C. These effects govern the onset temperature of
decomposition as well as the product distribution. In a series of re-
cent investigations, Song et al. [134 , 135] systematically studied the
wall’s catalytic effects on the decomposition of 4-chlorobiphenyl,
4,4 (cid:7) -dichlorobiphenyl, and 4-bromo-4 (cid:7) -chloro-biphenyl compounds.
It was illustrated that, the overall profile of the decomposition of
these two compounds, and the yields of formed PCDD/Fs were no-
ticeably affected by the reactor’s wall. For instance, during decom-
position of 4-chlorobiphenyl in alumina reactor, 3-MCDF started to

appear ∼350 °C, significantly lower than the corresponding tem-
perature reported in a high purity quartz reactor ( ∼ 400 °C), and a
highly purity quartz reactor coated with boron oxide ( ∼500 °C).
Formation  of  3-MCDF  at  temperature  as  low  as  350  °C  was  at-
tributed to a pathway that involves reaction of 4-chlorobiphenyl
with singlet oxygen. Trace concentration of transition metal oxides
in  alumina  and  quartz  was  postulated  to  convert  triplet  oxygen
into its excited singlet form. Boron oxide coating [136] was pos-
tulated to prevent surface mediated decomposition of the peroxy
group at low temperatures. The early studies on thermal decompo-
sition of PBDEs and PBBs have not attempted to decouple the ef-
fects of surfaces from those ensuing under uncatalysed conditions.
Nonetheless, any catalytic wall effects are likely to exhibit real sce-
narios encountered in incinerations and fire of PBDEs and PBBs in
reference to pure neat oxidation conditions that prevail in carefully
designed experiments that eliminate those effects.

3.4. Decomposition of 1,2-Bis-(2,4,6-tribromophenoxy)ethane (BTBPE)

Studies on the thermal decomposition of BTBPE provide a very
consistent picture. Balabanovich et al. [137] found that BTBPE, ini-
tially in a powder form, evaporates unaltered at 240 °C before it
completely decomposes at 340 °C in the gas phase. Striebich et al.
[118] investigated gas phase decomposition of BTBPE in an inert
and oxidative media and found very similar stability behaviour un-
der both oxidation and pyrolytic conditions. In both studies, ma-
jor  products  included  an  equivalent  amount  of  two  compounds,
2,4,6-tribromophenol and 2,4,6-tribromophenyl ether. Altarawneh
and Dlugogorski [138] reported that these two products arise from
the two most important channels in the unimolecular decomposi-
tion of the BTBPE molecule. These two channels characterise a 1,3-
2  site to an O site followed by a direct
hydrogen shift from a CH
scission of CH

2 –O bonds ( Scheme 26 ).

These two reactions have very similar energetic requirements:
266.8 kJ  mol −1  (1,3-hydrogen  shift)  and  276 kJ  mol −1  (fission  of
2 –O bond). Formation of several congeners of tetra-BDDs (TB-
CH
DDs) in Balabanovich et al. experiment indicates coupling of 2,4,6-
tribromophenol molecules or their derived 2,4,6-tribromophenoxy
radicals. Only isomers of PBDDs were detected. In the first instance,
double brominations of ortho sites in 2,4,6-tribromophenoxy rad-
icals  preclude  formation  of  PBDFs,  which  is  consistent  with  the
experiments of Balabanovich et al. [137] . Nonetheless, theoretical
modelling suggests that the formation of PBDFs could occur from
bimolecular reactions involving 2,4,6-tribromophenol molecule and
2,4,6-tribromophenoxy radical. Cross couplings involving two ortho
C(Br) sites weakens the strong aromatic C-Br facilitating the release
of a bromine atom from ortho site, ( Scheme 27 ).

The absence of any PBDFs compounds in Balabanovich et al.’s
[137] experiments could be due to the use of a single quadrupole
mass  spectrometer.  This  allows  no  attenuation  of  the  baseline
noise that would have been with a MS/MS (triple quadrupole) ma-
chine,  using  the  multiple  reactions  monitoring  (MRM)  technique
commonly  applied  for  PBDFs  detection.  Clearly,  future  work  on
BTBPE decomposition should carefully screen for the formation of
PBDFs.

4. Combustion chemistry of bromine

4.1. Speciation of bromine during decomposition of BFRs

Bromine  content  in  typical  MSWs  varies  in  the  range  of  20–
200 mg  kg −1  [139 –143] .  Concentrations  of  bromine  in  MSWs
loaded with BFRs could reach as high as few wt% [36 , 144 , 145] . As
such, it became imperative to study bromine speciation during the
thermal treatment of waste streams containing BFRs. Vehlow and
colleagues [36 , 144 , 145] observed bromine branching into gas, fly
ash and bottom ash during combustion of mixed typical munici-
pal solid wastes and flame-retarded extruded polystyrene in a pi-
lot incinerator at 950 °C. Fig. 13 shows the bromine inventory in
these three phases following the thermal treatment of e-waste. The
metallic loads in Vehlow et al. pilot scale experiments were mainly
Cu, Zn, and Pb, i.e., the typical metals in e-waste. Two key points
can be concluded from reported bromine phase speciation:

oxidation of HBr at high temperature. The high Br
2  contribution
in real incineration systems is in line with thermodynamic equi-
2 during com-
librium models which predict a predominance of Br
bustion [146] and pyrolysis [147] of bromophenols. However, the
previous two studies only considered speciation of bromine in the
gas phase without incorporating any metallic species.

The risk for the formation of Br

2 in the gas phase reported by
Vehlow [144] seems to contradicts with the findings by Wu et al.
[143] who studied the fate of bromine and its phase partitioning
from  co-combustion  of  biomass  under  a  corrosive  HBr  environ-
ment. Wu et al. [143] found that gaseous bromine solely exist as
HBr, and that fractionation of bromine in fine particles are higher
than gas phase fractionation. This is on contrary to Vehlow et al.
experiments  [36 , 144 , 145]  in  which  bromine  mainly  exists  in  the
gas phase, especially at higher bromine loads. It was found that
HBr [143] enhances the volatilization of the trace content of al-
kali metals in biomass (mainly K and Na) as alkali bromides. The
latter serves as nucleus for the growth of fine and coarse parti-
cles via agglomeration. Nonetheless, Vehlow et al. [144] and Wu
et  al.  [143]  did  not  specify  the  chemical  forms  of  metal  halides
in  the  fly  ash  and  fine  particles.  In  this  regard,  XRD  measure-
ments by Al-Harahsheh et al. [38] confirmed the formation of both
metal halides and metal oxybromides from the interaction of HBr
with several metal oxides (mainly ZnO and ZnFe
4 ) [38] . In Al-
Harahsheh et al. [38] pyrolysis experiments, nearly all evolved HBr
from thermal decomposition of TBBA was captured in the residue.
The distinct metallic content in the three set of experimental stud-
ies seems to affect the relative phase distribution of the bromine
content  as  well  as  chemical  speciation.  For  instance,  thermody-
namic  calculations  by  Al-Harahsheh  et  al.  [103]  illustrated  a  se-
lective bromination of the zinc content leading to its evaporation
2 . From a practical point of view, it is important to under-
as ZnBr
pin the interplay between the chemical forms of bromine (and its
phase fractionation), and the elemental metals that prevail in ther-
mal treatment and open burning of e-waste. The most important
metals to consider are those detected by Fujimori et al. [148] ; (Cu,
Pb, Fe, Co and Sr) in e-waste open burning soil.

• The  amount  of  bromine  in  bottom  ash  remains  nearly  con-
stant if the amount of input bromine increases. Input bromine
is of an organic nature that decomposes into gaseous HBr and
smaller brominated species at relatively low temperatures.

• The  majority  of  initial,  organic-bonded  bromine  disintegrates
into the gas phase. This minimises the chance of bromide for-
mations in fuel bed.

• The content of bromine found in fly ash increases with the in-
crease in input bromine due to the longer contact time of alka-
line fly ash and acidic HBr.

Fig. 14 a depicts the partitioning of gaseous Br into HBr and Br
The striking feature in this figure is that elemental bromine starts
to appear only when the total bromine gaseous content exceeds
300 mg  m −3 .  The  share  of  Br
2  reaches  50%  of  the  total  gaseous
fraction at higher bromine loads. It is not clear if the formation
2 was catalysed by a Deacon-like process or it stems from the
of Br

In chlorinated systems, HCl is by far the dominant species [149] .
This  noticeable  difference  between  chlorinated  and  brominated
systems could be partly due to the higher rate of HBr oxidation
by OH radicals in reference to the analogous HCl. The reaction rate
constant for the reaction OH + HBr  → H
2 O + Br is faster than its
chlorinated counterpart by 3 orders of magnitude at 298 K [150] .
Released Br atoms could readily convert HBr into Br
2 via the reac-
tion Br + HBr → H + Br
2 . These reaction rates also relate to entirely
different Deacon equilibrium situation between Br
2  and their
hydrogen halides (HBr/HCl).

2 /Cl

Other studies have reached similar conclusions by finding that
under  pyrolysis  (550  °C)  and  gasification  (1230  °C)  conditions,
most  bromines  exist  in  the  form  of  HBr,  with  smaller  fractions
2 and metal bromides [151 , 152] . Ni et al. [153] analysed the
of Br
occurrence of bromine as HBr and Br
2  produced by the combus-
tion of waste printed circuit boards. They analysed the effects of
temperature, residence time, and excess air on the conversion of
bromine into HBr/Br
2 . The effect of temperature was much more
pronounced  than  residence  time  on  bromine  speciation  in  solid
and  gas  phases.  At  higher  temperatures,  most  of  the  bromine

ture range of 80 0–140 0 °C, the ratio of HBr to Br
2 becomes greater
than  1.0,  while  it  drops  below  unity  under  800  °C.  At  1200  °C,
about 99.9% of raw bromine shifts to the flue gas and 0.1% persists
in the remaining solid residue [153] . Similar results were obtained
by Bientinesi et al. [154] , who reported that the majority of co-
combusted waste bromine existed in flue gas, with only a minor
part remaining in char. These findings qualitatively correlate with
results by Vehlow et al. [144] .

4.2. Bromine reactions with H/O species

Relatively weak aromatic and aliphatic C –Br bonds in BFRs mo-
tivate the release of Br atoms in the early stages of the combus-
tion process. The principal functionality of bromine in BFRs is to
trap active radicals from combustion media [132] . Adding molecu-
lar oxygen to brominated hydrocarbons also releases Br atoms di-
rectly via inversion substitution ( Scheme 27b ).
The three forms of gaseous bromine (Br

2 , HBr and Br) operate
effectively in the termination stage of oxidising agents, i.e. OH  ̇ and
H radicals:

Br + H → HBr

Br + OH → OHBr

HBr + H → H 2 + Br

HBr + OH → H 2 O + Br

Br 2 + H → HBr + Br

Br 2 + OH → Br + HOBr

Br + HO 2 → HBr + O 2

Br + Br → Br 2

Of  particular  importance  is  the  consumption  of  OH  radicals

by HBr, which also suppresses further oxidation of CO into CO
2,
thereby enhancing the formation of incomplete combustion prod-
ucts.  Atomic  oxygen  regenerates  Br  atoms  from  HBr  in  a  highly
exothermic reaction (259 kJ mol −1 ) [155] :

4.3. Bromine reactions with hydrocarbon species

1 –C

Decomposition of polymeric constituents produces a wide spec-
trum of hydrocarbons, ranging from short C
3 species to PAHs.
Babushok  and  Tsang  [157]  demonstrated  that  the  effect  of  the
bromine’s inhibition cycle on the oxidation process was very sim-
1 –C
ilar  regardless  of  the  initial  C
4  alkane  fuel.  They  found  that
burning velocity is only sensitive to the set of reactions in Table 5 ,
in  addition  to  the  reaction  of  Br  atoms  with  the  formyl  radical
(HCO),  i.e.,  an  important  intermediate  in  nearly  all  hydrocarbon
combustion reactions:

Br + HCO → HBr + CO

(R9)

Apart from significant decreases in the fuel’s burning velocity,
introducing bromine to the combustion system does not alter the
profile of products relative to pure fuel, as bromine-bearing species
only react significantly with the end-products of fuel combustion.
Interest in Br reactions with hydrocarbons stems mainly from
atmospheric applications. Abstractions of H by Br atoms from alka-
nes rapidly equilibrate with the reverse reaction [158] :

Br + RH → HBr + R

(R10)

Activation  energies  for  reaction  R10  positively  correlate  with
the bond dissociation enthalpies of C –H bonds. On the other hand,
abstractions  of  Br  atoms  from  bromine  molecules  [159]  by  alkyl
radicals are irreversible and often incur negative activation ener-
gies:

(R9)

Br 2 + R → RBr + Br

(R11)

Dixon-Lewis  et  al .  [156]  re-examined  the  high-temperature
bromine chemistry to update the inhibition mechanism involving
2 -doped flames. Table 5 lists rate constants for these reac-
HBr/Br
tions as considered in Dixon-Lewis et al.’s mechanism [156] . They
found that HBr and Br
2 act differently as inhibitors. For example,
R3 is rapidly equilibrated and depletes HBr in favour of atomic Br.
On the contrary, R5 is far from equilibrium and consumes H atoms
from the reaction zone via competition with the chain-propagating
reaction H + O
2 → O + OH. The most prominent chain-breaking re-
actions are R1, R7 and R8. Reactions involving HOBr are of negligi-
ble importance for removing or generating chain carriers in H/O/Br
flames. Flame speed increases rapidly if the inlet concentration of
molecular bromine exceeds 20%.

6 H

For  aromatic  compounds,  Bierbach  et  al.  [160]  attempted  to
measure  a  rate  constant  for  the  reaction  Br + C
6  at  298.15 K.
However,  they  could  not  establish  a  measurable  decay  of  ben-
zene.  An  upper  limit  for  the  reaction  was  assigned  a  value  of
1.0 × 10 −14 cm 3 molecule −1 s −1 at ambient conditions. Altarawneh
and Dlugogorski [124] found that, the reaction of Br atoms with
the aromatic ring proceeds via H abstraction at all temperatures,
with no contribution from an addition/substitution channel. Activa-
tion energy for the abstraction of aromatic’s H atoms by Br is sig-
nificantly higher (100 kJ mol −1 ) [124] than corresponding barriers
for abstractions of secondary H atoms from alkanes (40 kJ mol −1 )
[161] .

Fig. 15.  General decomposition pathways leading to formation of PBDD/Fs in the thermal breakdown of different BFRs.

5. Formation of PBDD/Fs

Congener profiles of PCDD/Fs measured during various combus-
tion and metallurgical thermal processes exhibit very similar spe-
cific isomer patterns [162 –164] . This implies that the majority of
PCDD/Fs, especially at low temperatures (i.e. 250–400 °C) form via
a common mechanism, i.e. de novo synthesis. It is estimated that
nearly 70% of PCDD/Fs emission is due to de novo synthesis [149] .
In contrast, the corresponding isomeric profiles of PBDD/Fs show
significant discrepancies among emission sources [164] . In princi-
ple, several mechanisms could potentially contribute to the forma-
tion of PBDD/Fs from BFRs-containing fuels:

• Direct transformation of BFRs into PBDD/Fs: Very high yield of
PBDFs  from  pyrolysis  and  oxidation  of  PBDEs  and  PBBs  pro-
poses  direct  conversion  of  these  BFRs  into  PBDD/Fs  prior  to
their decomposition. As demonstrated in Section 3.3 , theoret-
ical calculations illustrated direct and highly exothermic mech-
anisms  for  the  synthesis  of  PBDD/Fs  from  PBDEs  and  PBBs.
In  these  mechanisms,  unimolecular  rearrangement  reactions
of  ROO •  species  are  more  plausible  than  pathways  involving
rupturing of C –C/C –O linkages and closed-shell elimination of
H

2 /HBr.

• Homogenous  or  catalyst-assisted  coupling  of  bromophenols.
Decomposition of several BFRs, such as TBBA, PBDEs and BTBPE,
produce  appreciable  amounts  of  bromophenols.  Bromophe-

nols are potent building blocks for the formation of PBDD/Fs
through homogenous and heterogeneous corridors.

• De novo synthesis: Partial oxidation of organic residual carbon
and  PAHs  in  fly  ash  denotes  the  so-called  “de  novo” synthe-
sis. While the precursor pathway is generally more prevalent in
forming PBDD/Fs from BFRs, the de novo pathway is anticipated
to contribute significantly in two cases. Sufficient combustion
conditions completely degrade BFRs into short hydrocarbons. As
is the case for PCDD/F formation, these species initiate forma-
tion of PBDD/Fs via the de novo route [165] . On the other hand,
BFRs  with  no  aromatic  rings  in  their  structures,  i.e.  HBCDs,
do  not  decompose  to  give  high  concentrations  of  bromophe-
nols or bromobenzenes. As a result, formation of PBDD/Fs from
HBCDs most likely arises from the build-up of their fragmented
smaller brominated hydrocarbons. Fig. 15 summarises the path-
ways leading to the formation of PBDD/Fs from the thermal de-
composition of major BFRs.

5.1. Pathways to PBDD/Fs from bromophenols

While  certain  BFRs,  such  as  PBDEs  and  PBBs,  could  serve  as
direct  intermediates  for  the  formation  of  PBDD/Fs  via  oxidative
transformation, bromophenols the commonly-suggested precursors
for PBDD/Fs, form as major products from the decomposition of
several BFRs, most notably TBBA and BTBPE. In contrast to chlo-
rinated  phenols,  studies  on  the  combustion  or  pyrolysis  of  bro-

gen content, temperature residence time), and emission profiles of
PBDD/Fs [146 , 147 , 166 –169] .

5.1.1. Homogenous formation of PBDD/Fs from bromophenols and
bromobenzene’s

Evans  and  Dellinger  investigated  slow  pyrolysis  [147]  and
oxidation  [146]  ( τ = 2.0 s)  of  2-bromophenol  in  a  fused-
silica  flow  reactor  between  30 0–10 0 0  °C.  They  compared  the
temperature-product  profiles  with  their  previous  results  on
thermal  pyrolytic  and  oxidative  degradation  of  2-chlorophenol.
Fig.  16  presents  temperature-product  profiles  from  the  degrada-
tion  of  2-bromophenol  molecule  under  pyrolytic  and  oxidative
decomposition.  Observed  products  in  both  cases  included  lower
brominated  (i.e.  di-  or  mono-)  PBDD/Fs,  phenols,  naphthalene
and  benzenes.  As  Fig.  16  depicts,  thermal  degradation  of  the
2-bromophenol  molecule  starts  at  nearly  350  °C,  and  achieves
complete  destruction  at  800  °C.  The  unexpected  low  onset
decomposition  temperature  prompted  the  authors  to  consider
heterogeneous  wall  reactions  as  assisting  in  the  rupture  of  the
hydroxyl O –H bond (360 kJ mol −1 ) ( Scheme 28).

Reactions of H atoms with the parent 2-bromophenol molecule
are all exothermic and branch to abstraction of a hydroxyl’H atom,
abstraction of a Br atom, and displacement of a Br atom. The lat-
ter reaction is more favourable than addition at an ipso site, lead-
ing  to  expulsion  of  the  OH  group.  Hence,  phenol  forms  with  a
higher yield and at a lower temperature than bromobenzene. The
yield of brominated products under oxidative conditions is higher
than  that  under  a  pyrolytic  atmosphere.  According  to  pseudo-
equilibrium  calculations  [146 , 147] ,  oxygen  molecules  create  OH
radicals which convert HBr into water and the strong brominat-
ing agent, Br atoms. Bromination of the 2-bromophenol molecule
into  di-brominated  congeners  could  occur  either  by  addition  of
a  bromine  atom  to  a  2-bromophenoxy  radical  or  addition  of  a
bromine  atom  to  a  vacant  radical  site  in  a  phenyl-type  radical
( Scheme 29).

Bromophenols  form  more  PBDD/Fs  when  compared  with  the
yield of PCDD/Fs formed from chlorophenols. In fact, addition of
bromine enhances the formation of PCDD/Fs from chlorophenols
[21 , 168 , 170] . This interesting observation could be rationalised by
considering:

• Aromatic  C-Br  bonds  are  weaker  than  corresponding  C –Cl
bonds by 63 kJ mol −1 [171] . Formed Br atoms contribute to fur-
ther decomposition of chlorophenols by abstraction of phenolic
and aromatic H atoms.

• The predominant bromine in bromophenols systems is Br

2 , ver-
sus HCl in chlorophenols systems. HCl is largely unreactive (i.e.
BDH amounts to 340 kJ mol −1 ) and does not participate in fur-
ther destruction or chlorination reactions, which contrasts with
active Br
2  molecules that readily dissociate into Br atoms (i.e.
BDH  amounts  to  223 kJ  mol −1 ).  Released  Br  atoms  accelerate
the  formation  of  chlorophenoxy  radicals  from  chlorophenols,
which is a central step in PCDD/Fs generation.

versus 8.6% [172] . This in turn engenders self-condensation of
chlorophenoxy radicals via attachment of phenoxy’O at an or-
tho C(Cl) position to be less thermodynamically driven in refer-
ence to the analogous reaction in case of bromophenoxy radi-

cals. This reaction produces the direct pre-dioxin intermediate;
the enol-keto structure.

Formation  of  PBDD/Fs  from  bromophenols  follows  well-
documented  steps  analogous  to  the  synthesis  of  PCDD/Fs  from
chlorophenols  [173] .  Fig.  17  shows  the  formation  mechanism  of
PBDD/Fs, which occurs via the coupling of two 2-bromophenoxy
radicals. Principal reactions include:

• Coupling  or  self-condensation  of  bromophenol  molecules  or
bromophenoxy radicals, leading to the formation of pre-PBDD/F
intermediates.  Formation  of  pre-PBDF  intermediates  requires
coupling of two bromophenoxy radicals, each with at least one
ortho C(H) site. Addition of a phenolic’O atom to an ortho posi-
tion at another bromophenoxy radical produces pre-PBDDs in-
termediates.

• Cyclisation  of  pre-PBDDs  intermediates  into  PBDDs  is  accom-
panied with the unimolecular elimination of Br atoms or HBr
molecules.

• Single or double enolisation of keto-keto transforms pre-PBDFs
intermediates into PBDFs. This reaction is followed by a ring-
closure reaction leading to the expulsion of a water molecule.

Rate-determining  steps  in  closed-shell  corridors  (i.e.  an  over-
all activation barrier of 240–300 kJ mol −1 ) are ring-cyclisation re-

actions  that  lead  to  the  expulsion  of  HBr  (for  PBDDs)  and  H
(for PBDFs) [173] . Open-shell pathways afford significantly lower
overall activation barriers and are initiated by abstraction of H or
Br atoms from C –C or C –O bridges in the pre-PBDD/Fs interme-
diates.  Theoretical  studies  predict  that,  the  reaction  and  activa-
tion  energies  for  the  formation  of  PBDD/Fs  from  bromophenoxy
radicals  [174 , 175]  and  hydroxylated  diphenyl  ethers  [176 , 177]  to
be  very  similar  to  corresponding  mechanisms  forming  PCDD/Fs
from  chlorophenoxy  radicals  [173] .  It  follows  that  the  differ-
ence in dioxins product distributions between bromophenols and
chlorophenols  systems  must  arise  from  factors  mentioned  above
(i.e. weaker C-Br bonds and higher reactivity of Br
2 ), rather than
from their distinct thermochemical and kinetic parameters. Forma-
tion of phenylethyne and diphenylethyne at temperatures higher
than 700 °C suggests an addition of C
3  species (radicals and
molecules) to benzene and bromobenzene molecules [174] .

Bimolecular self-reactions of bromophenoxy radicals constitute
a rather minor exit channel compared with the unimolecular de-
composition into bromocyclopentadiene radicals. Altarawneh and
Dlugogorski [172] illustrate that, the position of Cl and Br substitu-
tion in halogenated phenoxy radicals exerts a minor influence on
kinetics parameters that underpin their decomposition along the
well-known three-step ring contraction/CO elimination mechanism
of in reference to unsubstituted phenoxy radicals ( Scheme 30).

Lifetime of 2-bromophenoxy was estimated to be 7.6 s; slightly
longer  than  that  of  2-chlorophenoxy  at  6.7 s.  The  relatively  long
lifetimes of halogenated phenoxy radicals enable these moieties to

undergo  their  self-condensation  reactions  into  halogenated  diox-
ins.  Recombination  of  bromocyclopentadiene  radicals  is  regarded
as a main source for the formation of bromonaphthalene molecules
( Scheme 31).

Naphthalene often acts as the first PAHs nucleolus for soot for-
mation [178] . Other proposed pathways for naphthalene molecule
formation include condensation from smaller alkane/alkene chains
at  higher  temperatures;  i.e.  HACA-  and  Diels-Alder-type  mecha-
nisms. In this regard, Ahubelem et al. [179] mapped out pathways
for the growth of chlorinated PAHs initiated from the decomposi-
tion of C
6 . Formation of brominated PAHs from degradation of
BFRs (as illustrated in the TBBA) takes place via similar pathways.
Several simplified and kinetic models describe the homogenous
gas  phase  decomposition  of  chlorophenol  molecules  and  subse-
quent formation of PCDD/Fs [149] . In contrast, corresponding ki-
netic  models  of  the  thermal/oxidative degradation of  bromophe-
nols are absent from the literature.

The  fact  that  yields  of  PBDFs  are  substantially  higher  than
that of PBDDs from open burning of e-waste and combustion of
BFRs-laden articles may suggest a dominant contribution pathway
that entails bimolecular reactions of bromophenols and bromoben-
zene’s. The role of bromobenznes as direct building blocks in the
selective formation of PBDEs and PBDFs has generally been over-
looked in previous mechanistic accounts [35] . Based on DFT mod-
elling  results  [180] ,  oxidation  of  bromobenzenes  commences  via
abstraction of aromatic H/Br atom followed by addition of an oxy-
gen molecule to the apparent radical site. Fission of the peroxyl
bond affords bromophenoxy radicals (Scheme 32).

Addition  of  bromophenoxy  radicals  to  the  bromobenzene
molecule through the active phenoxy’s O site predominantly forms
PBDEs and PBDFs rather than PBDDs ( Scheme 33).

Formation  of  these  pre-PBDEs/PBDFs  intermediates  necessi-
tates  activation  enthalpies  that  reside  in  a  narrow  range  of  78–
85 kJ  mol −1 .  Literature  presents  no  experimental  account  on  the
co-combustion of bromophenols and bromobenzene, or on oxida-
tion of bromobenzene. The commonly observed positive correla-

tion between concentrations of PBDEs and PBDFs may in fact re-
flect  a  plausible  dominance  for  the  bimolecular  reaction  of  bro-
mophenols and bromobenzens. To underpin the importance of this
reaction, it is required to experimentally investigate homogenous
as well as catalysed formation of PBDD/Fs from reactions of bro-
mophenols  and  bromobenzene.  The  obtained  yields  and  isomers
patterns  could  then  be  contrasted  with  analogous  profiles  from
open burning of e-waste and bromine-containing plastics.

5.1.2. Formation of PBDD/Fs and brominated EPFR from
chemisorption of phenols on metal oxides

In open burning of e-waste, the high loads of metals and their
oxides  act  as  potent  catalysts  in  the  formation  of  PBDD/Fs  from
bromophenols.  In  this  regard,  atmospheric  oxygen  could  read-
ily  oxidise  the  high  portion  of  elemental  Cu  in  printed  circuit
boards into CuO [181] . Comprehending of reaction routes operating
the surface-mediated synthesis of PBDD/Fs from coupling of bor-
mophenols and their derived phenoxy radical relies on unreveal-
ing the chemisorption mechanisms of bormophenols on metal ox-
ides. Via utilizing several diagnostic techniques, the seminal work
by Dellinger’s group [182 –187] has constructed a very detail repre-
sentation for the interaction of 2-chlorphenol and chlorobenzenes
molecules with CuO particles. Deployed solid-gas characterisation
tools encompass X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES)
to  monitor  the  change  in  the  oxidation  state  of  copper  in  the
course of the reaction, diffuse reflectance for infrared Fourier trans-
form spectroscopy (DRIFTS) to map out the variation in the vibra-
tional spectroscopy of 2-chlorphenol and chlorobenzene upon their
adsorption  on  CuO  particles,  and  electro  paramagnetic  response
(EPR) to measure radical signals and their types. Chemisorption of
the  2-chlorphenol  molecule  on  CuO  particles  was  found  to  pro-
duce a 2-chlorophenolate surface-bound moiety at low tempera-
ture ( ∼150 °C) though water elimination, and a surface-bound cat-
echolic  intermediate  at  higher  temperature  ( ∼350  °C)  via  elimi-
nation  of  HCl  [186 , 187] .  Chemisorption  of  a  1,2-dichlorobenzene
molecule affords both 2-chlorophenolate and catecholic interme-
diates.  Literature  presents  no  analogous  EPR  or  DRIFTS  mea-

surements  on  bromopehnols/bromophenols-CuO  systems.  How-
ever, when contrasting the thermochemistry of chlorophenols ver-
sus  bormophenols,  some  potential  fundamental  trends  could  be
deduced. Since aromatic C-Br bond (336 kJ mol −1 ) is significantly
weaker  than  phenolic’s  OH  bond  (386 kJ  mol −1 )  [171] ,  it  is  an-
ticipated that chemisorbed interaction of bromophenols and bro-
mobenzenes with CuO to predominantly produce catecholic-type
intermediate (i.e., o- semiquinone) at low temperatures. Phenolate-
type adduct could form via H transfer reactions ( Scheme 34).

Nonetheless, our hypothesis for an expected dominance of the
catecholic-type intermediate in bromopehnols/bromophenols-CuO
systems warrant validation by EPR and DRIFTS measurements.

Fig.  18  shows  proposed  pathways  for  the  surface-mediated
formation of PBDD/Fs from bromophenol molecules. A Langmuir-
Hinshelwood  mechanism  (reactions  between  two  adsorbed
species) operates in the formation of PBDFs, while generation of
PBDDs  occurs  via  an  Eley-Rideal  mechanism  (reactions  between
gaseous and adsorbed species). These two mechanisms also partic-
ipate in the formation of higher brominated congeners of benzenes
and  phenols.  Under  oxidative  and  pyrolytic  conditions  [166 , 167] ,
CuO-mediated  formation  of  PBDD/Fs  from  bromophenols  was
significantly higher than the equivalent formation of PCDD/Fs from
chlorophenols. This has been attributed to the ease of formation of
Br atoms in bromophenols systems compared with the formation
of Cl atoms from chlorophenols [166] . Concentrations of dibenzo-
p -dioxin (DD) and 1-monobromodibenzo- p -dioxin (1-MBDD) from
pyrolysis  of  2-bromophenol  on  CuO  were  substantially  higher
than  that  of  dibenzofuran  (DF)  and  its  brominated  congeners.
This is on the contrary to the pyrolysis of 2-chlorophenol on CuO
where somehow comparable concentrations of PCDDs and PCDFs
were obtained [188] . We envisage that this salient difference be-
tween the two systems is attributed to the nature of the adsorbate
species; phenolate versus catecholic. In the 2-chlorphneol/CuO sys-
tem,  radical  centre  in  adsorbed  phenolate  adduct  predominantly
appears at ortho carbons. This clearly facilitates the occurrence of
Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism toward the formation of PCDFs
as Fig. 18 portrays. In case of bromophenols/CuO system, it is en-
visaged that weak aromatic C-Br bonds in reference to phenolic’s
O –H  to  favours  formation  of  catecholic  surface-bound  adducts.
These  adducts  act  as  precursors  for  the  selective  formation  of
PBDDs rather than PBDFs. Along the same line of enquiry, recent
DFT  calculations  have  established  that  desorption  of  surface-
bound phenolate on alumina [189] and silica [190] surfaces into
gaseous  phenoxy  radicals  to  be  thermodynamically  forbidden
( ∼380 kJ mol −1 ), and that the fate of these moieties is controlled

spectra display.

corresponded to the elimination of CO molecules, with an energy
barrier in the range of 105–125 kJ mol −1 ( Scheme 35).

A  synergy  between  DFT  calculations,  DRIFTS  and  EPR  experi-
ments can establish on a precise atomic basis the extent of metal’s
reduction upon its interaction with bromophenols and bromoben-
zene  molecules,  energy  requirements  for  the  chemisorption  pro-
cess,  and  the  structural  and  electronic  parameters  for  the  pre-
sumed  catecholic  surface-attached  adducts.  These  combined  ap-
proaches  can  establish  mechanisms  for  the  formation  of  stabili-
sation of brominated persistent free organic radicals (EPFR). For-
mation of brominated EPFR from thermal decomposition of BFRs
has not yet been investigated. Bearing in mind the well-established
role of EPFR in inducing oxidative stress, damage to DNA, and res-
piratory  health  issues  [191] ,  plausible  generation  of  brominated
EPFR from open burning of e-waste adds a another sever dimen-
sion  to  the  environmental  burden  associated  with  thermal  recy-
cling of the non-metallic fraction in e-waste.

5.2. De novo synthesis of PBDD/Fs

Experiments on the thermal heating of municipal solid wastes
(MSWs) enriched with carbon and chlorine isotopes confirmed the
formation of PCDD/Fs via de novo synthesis through partial oxida-
tion of the soot matrix [192 , 193] . Condensation of two aromatic
rings  initiates  PAHs  formation.  Addition  of  oxygen  molecules  to
the surfaces of formed PAHs results in their oxidation and forma-
tion  of  dibenzo- p -dioxin  (DD)  and  dibenzofuran  (DF)  backbones.
Cosentino et al. [194] theoretically investigated de novo synthesis
of DF from pyrene and benzodibenzofuran, as model compounds
for the carbon matrix. They found that the rate-determining step

Stanmore [195] and Altarawneh et al. [149] reviewed and anal-
ysed kinetic factors controlling PCDD/Fs formation in thermal sys-
tems by the de novo process. Salient mechanistic aspects relevant
to de novo synthesis are still not fully understood. Yields by de
novo synthesis seem also to be affected not only by fly ash con-
tent, but also by the constituents in the gas phase. Some interpre-
tations [196] propose that de novo routes from elemental carbon
forms non-halogenated DD/DF compounds, but major halogenation
is due to gas phase reactions and back-adsorption on the partially
halogenated carbon surfaces.

Heinbuch  and  Stieglitz  [197]  demonstrated  that  the  forma-
tion  of  halogenated  compounds  by  de  novo  synthesis  is  not  re-
stricted to chlorinated molecules. They substituted inorganic chlo-
ride with bromide in MSWs fly ash to find analogous halogenation
effects. Yields of brominated products correlated with the amount
of bromine added. However, only lower brominated congeners of
PBDFs  were  found.  This  was  attributed  to  the  low  volatility  of
higher brominated PBDFs. Lower brominated congeners can read-
ily evaporate, and thus escape destruction by the fly ash. Ortunõ
et al. [37] studied de novo formation of PBDD/Fs by heating mix-
tures of activated carbon with different loads of CuBr
2 . Addition
2 greatly accelerated the oxidative breakdown of carbona-
of CuBr
2  started at ∼150 °C and
ceous structures. Decomposition of CuBr
produced CuBr and gaseous Br
2 . DSC runs estimated the overall ac-
tivation energies for the decompositions of a pure carbon mixture,
2 , as being 159 kJ mol −1 and
and a mixture containing 50% wt CuBr
79 kJ mol −1 , respectively. These two values correlate well with the
differences in bond energy between C –C and C –Br bonds. Formed

The comparable yields of PBDDs and PBDFs indicate that de novo
route may not be the main synthesis pathway. A very high yields
of PBDEs prompted Wang et al. [198] to suggest that PBDEs are
the  main  precursors  for  the  formation  of  PBDD/Fs.  Nonetheless,
Wang  et  al.  did  not  screen  for  the  presence  of  other  commonly
discussed precursors, most notably brominated phenols, benzenes
and biphenyls.

The dominance of 1,2-dibromobenzene in the homologue group
of dibromobenzenes assumes a two-step process in the de novo
formation of brominated species [199] . The first step characterises
bromination  of  the  carbon  surface  in  a  side-by-side  orientation.
This is followed by an oxidative decomposition of the carbon sur-
face in a mechanism similar to pathways suggested by Cosentino
et  al  [194] .  Total  yield  of  PBDD/Fs  was  approximately  10  times
higher  when  compared  with  the  de  novo  synthesis  of  PCDD/Fs.
Similarly, Schuler and Jager [165] observed that rates of PBDD/Fs
formation in a pilot incineration plant were 4 – 20 times higher
than their chlorinated counterparts.

Bearing  in  mind  that  the  complete  destruction  of  BFRs  leads
to the formation of small brominated species, it will be informa-
tive  to  investigate  PBDD/Fs  formation  from  the  oxidative  degra-
dation of bromo alkanes or alkenes. Likewise, pyrolysis of HBCDs
produces  several  PAHs  [107] .  The  literature  provides  no  compa-
rable  combustion  studies.  Decomposition  of  HBCDs  in  the  pres-
ence of oxygen may promote PBDD/F formation via conversion of
Oxygenated  PAHs  into  PDD/Fs.  This  assumption  warrants  further
investigation.

5.3. Bromination mechanisms

The majority of bromine produced by thermal decomposition of
BFRs comes from organic sources, i.e. it was originally bonded in
BFRs structures. The prevailing heterogeneous halogenation path-
ways in case of PCDD/Fs are generally of less importance as halo-
genation  pathways  for  the  production  of  PBDD/Fs  from  BFRs.  In
addition to the presence of bromine in parent BFRs and their frag-
mented products, gaseous reactions are expected to play a major
role in the bromination of PBDD/Fs. Reactions of Br, HBr and Br
2
with phenyl-type radicals are crucial bromination routes in the gas
phase ( Scheme 36).

Since Br

2 exists in appreciable amounts in brominated systems,
2 in a chlorine-
2 is more preva-

in contrast to the very dilute concentrations of Cl
bearing environment, gas phase bromination by Br
lent than chlorination by elemental chlorine.

Most studies on the halogenation of organic pollutants have fo-
cused on chlorination mechanisms. There is a clear disparity with
studies on bromination pathways. The high metallic Cu content in
e-waste [200] could, in principle, promote the occurrence of het-

peratures [37] . Reprinted with permission from American Chemical Society.

PBDD/Fs reached a maximum yield of 91.7 ng g −1 at 300 °C. Once
again, the amount of PBDFs significantly overshot that of PBDDs,
confirming the occurrence of de novo synthesis. Fig. 19 [37] shows
the total concentrations of PBDDs and PBDFs in gas phase and in
solid residue at different temperatures. The significant decline in
evolved concentrations of PBDFs with temperature indicates that
oxidative  breakdown  of  the  carbon  matrix  is  favoured  at  lower
temperatures; where the carbonaceous surface still retains its def-
inite  structure  [37] .  The  same  temperature-product  trends  were
also observed by Heinbuch and Stieglitz [197] , who found that the
yield of brominated compounds by de novo formation reaches its
maximum at 350 °C.

Wang  et  al.  [198]  investigated  thermochemical  formation  of
PBDD/Fs  from  simulated  combustion  of  fly  ash  sourced  from  a
secondary  copper  smelter.  Detected  PBDD/Fs  peaked  at  95 ng/g
around  450  °C  with  formation  of  PBDD/Fs  unexpectedly  com-
menced at temperature as low as 150 °C. Reaction rate constants
for the formation of several PBDD/Fs congeners were fitted to Ar-
rhenius  parameters  with  overall  activation  energies  in  the  range
9–55 kJ  mol −1 .  The  homologue  profiles  of  PBDD/Fs  were  largely
dominated by hepta and octa congeners. The surprisingly low ac-
tivation energies and the very low onset temperature for the for-
mation of PBDD/Fs were attributed to profound catalytic capacity
of abundant copper species in the fly ash. However, no attempts
were  made  to  characterize  the  chemical  forms  of  these  species.

erogeneous bromination routes similar to those operating in the
chlorination of PCDD/Fs, most notably [149] :

• Gaseous bromination.
• Surface dehydrogenation.
• Transfer of inorganic bromine to residue carbon during or prior

to de novo synthesis.

• Deacon reaction.

Several studies have assessed the efficiency of metal oxides in
forming Cl
2 from HCl via the Deacon process [201] ; however, there
are  no  analogous  studies  on  the  effectiveness  of  the  Deacon  re-
action to produce HBr. Nevertheless, experimental measurements
from a pilot-scale plant [36] , as well as thermodynamic equilib-
rium  models  [147] ,  confirm  the  presence  of  high  concentrations
of Br
2  during the decomposition of brominated aromatics, with-
out assistance by the Deacon process. Formation of PBDD/Fs via de
novo synthesis, where the source of bromine was of an inorganic
nature [202] , indicates a transfer of bromine from inorganic ma-
terials to the carbon matrix. Overall, the exact role of Cu surfaces
in generating halogen atoms is not yet fully elucidated. For exam-
ple, it is not clear whether these Cu-surfaces assist in generating
halogen atoms from hydrogen halides or merely act as catalysts for
electrophilic substitution. Several hypotheses on the role of Cu/Fe-
based catalysts in facilitating the halogenation of organic pollutants
could be tested by observing the pattern and degree of halogena-
tion in mixtures of hydrogen halides/halides/phenol (with varying
relative loads) over Cu-containing surfaces.

The exact mechanism for the generation of Br
2 from interaction of
HBr with metal oxides and its underlying kinetics parameters are
not yet stablished. However, several experimental [103] and the-
oretical [102 , 203] studies have illustrated thermo-kinetics param-
eters  for  bromination  of  metal  oxides  by  dissociative  adsorption
of HBr followed by water elimination. Fig. 20 [203] depicts energy
profile for the bromination of ZnO by HBr.

The role of CuBr

2 as a direct bromination agent for organic pol-
lutants  has  not  been  thoroughly  assessed.  In  this  regard,  CuBr
2
is often utilised as a bromination agent in organic synthesis due
to its excellent  coordination capability [204] . Experimental stud-
ies  point  out  that  CuCl
2  is  a  very  effective  chlorination  agent
[205 , 206] . CuCl
2 has been viewed as a shuttle that transfers inor-
ganic chlorine from fly ash to PCDD/Fs moieties [149] . Due to the
2  [55] , the latter
very similar structures of CuCl
could be involved in heterogeneous transmission of bromine into
gaseous PBDD/Fs compounds. This occurs via the presumed two-
step surface-catalysed mechanism ( Scheme 37).

2  [207] and CuBr

Neither kinetics parameters nor the mechanistic steps are pre-
cisely  known.  Experimental  proof  for  the  occurrence  of  surface
bromination comes from the observation of the reduction of CuBr
2
into CuBr during de novo synthesis of PBDD/Fs [37] . It is sensible
to assume that DD and DF moieties are formed via de novo syn-
thesis, followed by surface bromination.

Altarawneh and Dlugogorski [208] demonstrated that, the ex-
perimentally  observed  chlorination  pattern  of  PCDDs  and  PCDFs
are in accord with computed Fukui electrophilic indices, support-
ing  the  hypothesis  for  the  occurrence  of  electrophilic  chlorina-
tion as a main chlorination pathways for PCDD/Fs. The predicted
chlorination  pattern  for  PCDDs  follows  the  sequence  DD  →  2-
MCDD → 2,8-DCDD → 2,3,8-TriCDD → 3,3,7,8-TCDD. It will be in-
sightful to acquire the corresponding bromination sequence of PB-
DDs  and  PBDFs.  This  will  enable  to  assess  if  the  experimentally
observed distribution of isomers within each homologue group is
influenced by relative probability for the formation of each isomers
by an electrophilic bromination route. In this regard, Sovocool et al.
[209] reported formation of mono to octa-bromodibenzofuran from
an electrophilic bromination of dibenzofuran in the aqueous phase.
The chlorination trend of dibenzofuran reported by Sovocool et al.
[209]  follows  the  order  DF  →  2-MBDF  →  2,8-DBDF  →  2,8,9-
TriBDF → 1,2,8,9- TBDF. This sequence differs from the analogous
chlorination  ordering  reported  by  Altarawneh  and  Dlugogorski
[208]  for  dibenzofuran:  DF  →  3-MCDF  →  3,7-DCDF  →  2,3,7-
TriCDF → 2,3,7,8-TCDF. It is advised to calculate Fukui indices for
electrophilic  bromination  of  dibenzofuran  and  to  design  experi-
ments that simulate the occurrence of bromination of dibenzofu-
ran  and  dibenzo- p -dioxin  molecules  under  standard  electrophilic
conditions in the gas phase.

Significant  concentrations  of  2,6-dibeomophenol  and  2,4,6-
tribromophenol from the interaction of 2-bromophenol with CuO
indicated a surface-mediated bromination mechanism. The radical
character in adsorbed 2-bromophenolate mainly appears at ortho

these sites ( Scheme 38).

The  apparent  radical  sites  at  ortho  and  para  site  could
also  undergo  bromination  via  gas  phase  reaction  with  abun-
dant  HBr  molecules.  Tautomerization  step  transforms  adsorbed
bromophenolate-type intermediates into bromophenols congeners.
Many aspects of the homogenous and heterogeneous bromina-
tion routes of PBDD/Fs require further attention. For example, co-
pyrolysis/oxidation of benzene with Br
2 and/or HBr could highlight
the extent to which pure gas phase bromination proceeds and if ei-
ther of these two molecules can be an effective brominating agent
in pure gas phase reactions. Likewise, simulated combustion exper-
iments could be carried out in which distinct Br isotopes co-exist.
The use of Br isotopes (i.e., 79 Br) for the inorganic bromine con-
2 /HBr ( 77 Br) could assist to trace the source of
tent and gaseous Br
PBDD/Fs’s bromine in open burning of e-waste, and to shed light
into the very complex bromination mechanism.

Bromine  concentration  in  a  typical  MSW  is  ∼50–200  times
lower that of chlorine, i.e. around 20–200 mg kg −1 in comparison
to chlorine concentration i.e. 40 0 0–10,0 0 0 mg kg −1  [144 , 210 , 211] .
Only  very  small  amounts  of  mono-  and  di-bromo-polychloro-
DD/DFs are formed compared with PCDD/Fs [212] . However, suf-
ficient amounts of BFRs-containing materials in thermal processes
such as metallurgical operations, uncontrolled burning of plastics
and  recycling  of  e-waste  produce  [213 , 214]  considerable  concen-
trations of bromine in the fly ash as well as in the vapour phase.
Consequently, these processes represent hot spots for the forma-
tion of mixed halogenated dioxins (PXDD/Fs). PXDD/Fs could also
form via natural occurrence [215] .

The increase in Br/Cl ratios in waste combustion processes cor-
relates  with  an  increase  in  PXDD/Fs  concentration  (particularly
for lower brominated congeners). The carbon skeleton of PXDD/Fs
must  form  via  the  same  mechanisms  operating  in  the  forma-
tion of PCDD/Fs and PBDD/Fs (i.e. homogenous or catalyst-assisted
coupling  of  halogenated  phenols  or  benzenes,  oxidative/pyrolytic
transformation of certain BFRs and de novo synthesis). Fig. 21 de-
picts concentrations of PBDFs, PCDFs and PXDFs from e-waste open
burning  soil  samples.  Released  concentrations  of  dioxin-related
products  from  open  burning  of  e-waste  were  in  the  order  of

PBDFs > PCDFs > PXDFs [28] . The most abundant PXDFs congeners
were either mono- or di-chlorinated. It was postulated that chlo-
rination of PBDFs via a Cl-Br exchange reaction is the source of
PXDFs.  The  fact  that  concentrations  of  PXDFs  were  lower  than
those of PBDD/Fs and PCDD/Fs entails an insignificant contribution
of the de novo route in the formation of PXDD/Fs from op burning
of  e-waste.  Overall,  PXDD/Fs  formation  mechanisms  are  still  not
completely  understood.  The  most  intriguing  remaining  questions
are related to the relationship between initial bromine input and
formed  PXDD/Fs,  the  nearly  universal  dominance  of  PXDFs  over
PXDDs, and the relative contribution of de novo synthesis versus
the precursor’s pathway that typically dominates PBDD/Fs forma-
tion.

6.1. Formation of PXDD/Fs from mixed halogenated phenols

Evans  and  Dellinger  expanded  their  studies  on  the  oxidation
and pyrolysis of pure 2-chlorophenol and 2-bromophenol to study
the  co-pyrolysis  [216]  and  co-combustion  [217]  of  an  equimolar
mixture of these two compounds. Under both operational condi-
tions, 4-bromo-6-chlorodibenzofuran (4-B,6-CDF) was the only de-
tected PXDD/Fs product. As was the case with pyrolysis and oxida-
tion of pure 2-chlorophenol [218] and 2-bromophenol [147] , non-
halogenated  dibenzo- p -dioxin  (DD)  constituted  the  most  abun-
dant species. The maximum yields of DD under co-pyrolysis of 2-
chlorphenol and 2-bromophenol [216] were 4 times higher than
that  of  pure  2-chlorophenol  [218] ,  and  5  times  lower  than  that
of  2-bromophenol  [147] ,  in  that  order.  Formation  of  more  DD
from  pyrolysis  of  a  mixture  containing  2-chlorophenol  and  2-
bromophenol,  compared  with  pyrolysis  of  pure  2-chlorophenol,
suggests  assistance  by  bromine  atoms  [217] .  This  observation
is  consistent  with  the  general  consensus  that  adding  bromine
to  chlorophenols  systems  increases  the  yield  of  PCDD/Fs.  This
increase  is  partially  due  to  the  reaction  of  Br  atoms  with
2 → BrCl + Cl [147] . Pseudo-equilibrium ther-

modynamic  calculations  of  a  pyrolytic  50:50  2-bromophenol/2-

chlorophenol mixture confirms the formation of trace concentra-
tions  of  Cl  atoms,  where  Cl  atoms  were  not  present  upon  con-
sidering  a  neat  2-chlorophenol  system  [218] .  Oxidation  of  a  2-
chlorophenol  and  2-bromophenol  mixture  [217]  produces  more
4,6-DBDF  and  4,6-DCDF  than  that  from  oxidation  of  individ-
ual  2-chlorophenol  and  2-bromophenol  components.  Under  ox-
idative  conditions,  copious  OH  radicals  accelerate  the  rupture
of  phenolic  O –H  bonds  and  produce  Br  atoms  from  HBr  (i.e.
OH + HBr → H

2 O + Br) [217] .

Pathways for the formation of PXDD/Fs from mixed halogenated
phenols  are  similar  to  the  corresponding  pathways  producing
PCDD/Fs and PBDD/Fs from their corresponding pure halogenated
phenols.  Clearly,  DD  could  form  from  the  coupling  of  two  phe-
noxy radicals, or a phenoxy radical with either a 2-chlorophenoxy
or a 2-bromophenoxy radical. A quantum chemical study [219] re-
vealed that the formation of pre-PXDDs and pre-PXDFs interme-
diates incurred comparable exothermicity, in the ranges of 72.8–
120.0 kJ mol −1 and 59.8–107.6 kJ mol −1 , respectively. The 4-B,6-CDF
molecule forms via an ortho C(H)// ortho C(H) coupling involving 2-
bromophenoxy and 2-chlorophenoxy radicals ( Scheme 39).

Preliminary theoretical results indicate that the kinetics param-
eters [220] of the final ring-closure reaction are not sensitive to
halogenation type for closed-shell reactions. Fig. 22 shows the ef-
fect of halogenation type on the kinetics of final cyclisation reac-
tions. For example, at 400 °C, reaction rate constant for the ring-
closure in a hydroxylated diphenyl ether intermediate via elimina-
tion of HCl is slower than the corresponding rate for HBr elimina-
tion by a factor of ∼15. This is expected in view of the noticeable
difference in bond dissociation enthalpies between aromatic C –Br
and C –Cl bonds.

A DFT study by Saeed et al. [220] attempted to explain the ab-
sence  of  any  PXDDs  congeners  from  co-pyrolysis/oxidation  of  2-
chlorphenol and 2-bromophenol mixtures in Evans and Dellinger’s
experiments [216 , 217] . Fig. 23 portrays reaction pathways that lead
to the formation of 1-monobromo dibenzo- p -dioxin (1-MBDD), 1-
mono  bromo  dibenzo- p -dioxin  (1-MCDD)  (1-MBDD),  1-bromo-6-

chlorodibenzo- p -dioxin  (1-B,6-CDD),  1-bromo-9-chlorodibenzo- p -
dioxin (1-B,9-CDD), and DD. Ring closure reactions toward an or-
tho  C(H)  sites  were  found  to  be  faster  than  ring  cyclization  to-
ward ortho C(Cl) and C(Br) sites. The former leads to the forma-
tion of PXDDs while the latter forms PCDDs and PBDDs. Nonethe-
less, bearing in mind the accuracy limits generally associated with
DFT calculations, it was concluded that PXDDs (1-B,6-CDD and 1-B,
9-CDD) forms at rates comparable to DD, 1-MBDD, and 1-MCDD.
A  profound  wall-catalytic  effect  in  Evans  and  Dellinger’s  experi-
ments [216 , 217] may have also contributed to the destruction of
any  formed  PXDDs.  The  potential  for  the  formation  of  PXDD/Fs
(as  theoretically  proven  by  Saeed  et  al .  [219] )  from  mixtures  of
2-bromophenol and 2-chlorophenol molecules demands additional
experimental re-examination under pure gas phase conditions (i.e.
ultra-pure quartz reactors coated with boric acid) with considering
varying concentrations of the two halogenated phenols. Along the
same line of enquiry, a limiting case scenario for investigating the

formation  of  PXDD/Fs  from  mixed  halogenated  phenols  requires
considering different halogenation types on the two ortho positions
of  the  phenol  ring.  Bearing  in  mind  that  halogenation  on  meta
and para sites does not exert an influence on steps governing the
formation of PXDD/Fs, a 2-bromo,6-chloro-phenol molecule repre-
sents an excellent candidate for this case. Likewise, to the best of
our knowledge, literature presents no account on the homogenous
formation of PXDFs from other structurally-related precursors. Pro-
duction of PCDFs from oxidation of chlorinated benzenes suggests
[149]  that  co-oxidation  of  brominated  and  chlorinated  benzenes
may potentially form appreciable amounts of PXDFs.

6.2. Formation of PXDD/Fs from BFRs-containing fuels

Several  bench-  and  pilot  scale  experiments  have  investigated
the  formation  of  PXDD/Fs  from  BFRs-containing  fuels  [221–238] .

combustion/pyrolysis of the few chlorine and bromine-containing
components  provides  important  mechanistic  information  on  the
synthesis  routes  of  PXDD/Fs  [222] .  Three  reactions  are  proposed
to control the final yields of PXDD/Fs; chlorine-bromine exchange,
bromination of PCDD/Fs, and formation by de novo synthesis. Com-
mencing  with  the  chlorine-bromine  exchange  reactions,  Thoma
et al. co-pyrolysed 1,2,3,4-TBDD and materials with three distinct
chlorine donors: PVC, HCl and NaCl [221] . Pyrolysis of 1,2,3,4-TBDD
with PVC, HCl and NaCl at 900 °C yielded 34.7%, 20.5% and 0.3%
1,2,3,4-TCDD,  respectively.  It  follows  that  inorganic  chlorine  con-
tent  such  as  NaCl (i.e.  the  predominant chlorine  form  in  typical
MSW) does not contribute significantly to chlorine incorporation
in PBDD/Fs. Pyrolysis of PVC with PBDEs and PBBs at 800 °C [122] ,
produced several mixed halogenated congeners of diphenyl ether
(PXDEs)  and  biphenyl  (PXBs).  While  the  two  experimental  stud-
ies  by  Thoma  et  al.  [122,221]  confirm  formation  of  mixed  halo-
genated species, intermediate reactions are still not clear. At tem-
peratures  as  high  as  80 0–90 0  °C,  rupture  of  C-Br  bonds  occurs

readily, leaving radical sites. Addition of chlorine to the apparent
radical site could take place via a simple gas-phase abstraction re-
action ( Scheme 40).

Gradual and slow rise in temperature offers a better verifica-
tion of the occurrence of the presumed bromine-chlorine exchange
prior to the rupture of C-Br bonds ( Scheme 41).

Söderström and Marklund [239] investigated the effects of BFRs
type (TBBA, HBCD and PDDEs) and bromine load (Br/Cl ratios in
initial fuel of 1:1 or 2:1) on the formation of PXDD/Fs from ar-
tificial  solid  waste  in  a  pilot-scale,  fluidised  bed  incinerator  at
temperatures of 800–820 °C. All chlorine-bromine containing fuels
produced  PXDD/F  congeners,  especially  tetra  mixed  halogenated
Br = 4)  isomers.  Fig.  24  com-

regard to the dependency of the total yield of PXDFs isomers on
the  type  of  added  BFRs  and  the  bromine  load.  However,  careful

inspection of their TXDF profiles reveals that the significant yield
of  (cid:3) Di-Br,  diCl-DF  isomers,  when  using  PBDEs  as  a  source  of
bromine, originated from a simple conversion of PBDE to PBDFs.
Chlorination reactions of TBDF isomers transform them into TXDF
congeners ( Fig. 24 ). It is also plausible to assume that feed PBDEs
experience chlorination substitution [240] prior to their conversion
into PXDFs congeners. The high furan/dioxin ratios from various in-
cineration/metallurgical processes indicates the presence of PBDEs
in initial fuels and a plausible predominance of the de novo syn-
thesis route in the formation of PXDD/Fs [212] . Thus, chlorine in
PXDD/Fs could originate from an inorganic source (i.e, NaCl) while
bromine is of organic origin (in feed BFRs). Clearly, this hypothesis
could be tested via using Br and Cl isotopes in simulated combus-
tion experiments.

When chlorine and bromine are present, the yields of PXDD/Fs
were always greater than their chlorinated or brominated counter-
parts (i.e. diBr-,diCl-DF versus TBDFs and TCDFs) [176] . Total con-
centrations of TXDFs isomers were 10 times higher than those of
TCDFs congeners formed in a pure chlorine environment, but were
comparable to PBDFs congeners formed in a pure bromine envi-
ronment. Overall, PXDD/Fs formation is a complex process, and the
final halogenation degree does not rely only on the structure of
present BFRs, but also depends on the interplay between Cl- and
Br-containing gaseous species (HCl, HBr, BrCl, etc.).

As an important mechanistic fingerprint, Söderström and Mark-
lund  [239]  measured  the  fractions  of  bromine  incorporated  into
PXDD/Fs at high (800 °C) and low (250 °C) temperatures [239] . Ini-
tial fuels contained equal molar amounts of chlorine and bromine

(introduced  as  comparable  ratios  of  deBDE,  TBBA  and  HBCD).
Fig. 25 presents the fraction of Br in formed PXDD/Fs homologue
groups as a proportion of total halogen content (Br + Cl). As de-
picted in this figure, there is a shift toward more brominated com-
pounds as the temperature increases. Thermodynamic factors aid
the formation of brominating species (Br, Br
2 and BrCl) at all tem-
peratures. The authors [239] stated that highly chlorinated com-
pounds  have  greater  thermodynamic  stability  at  lower  tempera-
tures and, hence, they appear at higher concentrations than higher
brominated compounds. It will be instrumental to acquire Gibbs
free energies for formation for selected isomers in each PXDD/Fs
homologue group to test if relative abundance of these isomers is
thermodynamically driven. Preference toward chlorination at lower
temperatures might be kinetically driven. The absence of a kinetic
model describing mixtures of Br
2 precludes conclusions

regarding the prevalence of kinetic considerations at low tempera-
tures.

6.3. De novo formation of PXDD/Fs

The  majority  of  PCDD/Fs  form  in  the  post-combustion  zone
of MSW incinerators. The less stable BFRs materials are expected
to be decomposed completely under sufficient combustion condi-
tions. This practice concentrates Br in the fly ash. The co-existence
of  bromine  and  chlorine  in  the  fly  ash  alongside  potent  metal-
based catalysts serves as optimum conditions for the formation of
PXDD/Fs through the de novo corridor. There is a paucity of ex-
perimental studies on de novo synthesis of PXDD/Fs. Thoma et al
[122 , 221] demonstrated that annealing a mixture of fly ash with
inorganic Cl, Br donors produces several congeners of PXDD/Fs. It is
worthwhile noting that data were presented qualitatively. As such,
no attempts were made to correlate yields of formed PXDD/Fs with
chlorine and bromine inputs.

Fig. 26.  General pathways for the formation of PBDD/Fs and PXDD/Fs from open-burning and thermal recycling of e-waste.

Weber et al. [226] investigated the formation of PXDD/Fs from
oxidative decomposition of model fly ash loaded with equimolar
concentrations of inorganic chlorine and bromine (potassium salts).
At 350 °C, the yield of PXDD/Fs reached as high as 5.0% wt of the
initial  carbon  input.  Concentrations  of  PXDFs  congeners  were  at
least 9 times higher than those of PXDDs, at all considered tem-
peratures.  Decreases  in  temperature  enhanced  bromine  substitu-
tion in PXDD/Fs isomers, whereas allowing more contact time re-
sulted in an average enhancement of chlorine substitution. Total
PCDD/Fs amounted to only 20% of total PXDD/Fs on a molar ba-
sis. The dominance of PXDFs congeners over PXDDs and the high
yield of PXDFs compared with PCDDs has also been reported in the
oxidation of fly ash with BFRs. Isomer patterns in the homologue
groups of PXDDs and PXDFs showed very similar trends, suggesting
similar  bromination  and  chlorination  mechanisms  during  the  de
novo synthesis. Kawamoto and Ishikawa [235] found that heating
an ash sample with an added bromine load (in the form of TBBA)
substantially increased its PXDD/Fs content and clearly changed its
homologue distribution pattern. The authors considered this to be
strong evidence of the de novo synthesis. According to a statisti-
cal model developed by Funcke et al . [234] , PXDFs isomers yielded
by de novo synthesis correlated very well with input Br/(Br + Cl)
ratios.  This  model  also  enabled  the  estimation  of  input  bromine
content in the fly ash from known PXDD/F gas concentrations.

While  inexpensive  catalysts  such  as  red  mud  [241]  and  elec-
tric  arc  furnace  dust  [242]  can  debrominate  hydrocarbon  enti-
ties  during  chemical/thermal  recycling  of  BFRs,  it  was  recently
demonstrated  that  iron  (III)  oxide,  (a  major  constituent  in  elec-
tric arc furnace dust), facilitates conversion of bromophenols into
bromophenoxy radicals, i.e. a crucial step in synthesis of the no-
torious  PBDD/Fs  [102] .  The  situation  appears  different  for  open
burning,  including  fires,  i.e.  the  currently  largest  contributors  to
emissions of halogenated pollutants, as these phenomena involve
both metallic and non-metallic fraction of BFRs. The non-optimal
combustion conditions in these systems promote direct (i.e., pre-
cursor  rather  than  de-novo  pathway)  conversion  of  BFRs  into
PBDD/Fs  and  eventually  to  PXDD/Fs,  via  PBDEs  precursors  that
originate  from  the  technical  grade  of  the  now-defunct  formula-
tion of PentaPCDE [20] . In spite of this progress, formation mech-
anisms of PXDD/Fs remain incompletely developed, preventing de-
sign of effective thermal recycling systems for articles treated with
BFRs and calculations of emission factors of PCDD/F, PBDD/F and
PXDD/F  in  fires.  A  comprehensive  understanding  of  PXDD/F  for-
mation via de novo synthesis requires the consideration of several
factors:

• In all published experiments on de novo formation of PXDD/Fs,
bromine donors were of an inorganic nature. Complete degra-
dation of BFRs produces brominated short alkanes and alkenes.

Consequently,  it  is  of  more  relevance  to  deploy  brominated
C
3  species  as  bromine  donors  in  de  novo  formation  of
PXDD/Fs.

1 –C

• As Cu exist is a main metal in printed circuit boards, forma-
tion of CuBr
2  during thermal recycling of electronic wastes is
very plausible. It will be interesting to study competing chlo-
rination  and  bromination  processes  during  de  novo  synthesis
when equimolar amounts of CuCl
2 are used in model
fly ashes.

2 and CuBr

• If BFRs are used as the source of bromine in fly ashes, it is dif-
ficult to trace the source of bromine partaking in de novo syn-
thesis. Does bromine come from the original input in BFRs or
from brominated species formed during BFRs decomposition?
Comparing the yields and halogenation patterns of PXDD/Fs at
low temperatures (prior to BFRs degradation) and high temper-
atures (after complete destruction of BFRs) could provide some
fingerprints of the source of bromine participating in de novo
synthesis.

• It  is  generally  believed  that  chlorinated  C

3  species  go
through  complex  addition  and  oxidation  reactions  to  yield

7. Formation of PBDD/Fs from open burning and thermal
recycling of e-waste

Based  on  the  survey  of  detailed  mechanistic  pathways  gov-
erning formation of PBDD/Fs and PXDD/Fs presented throughout
this review, Fig. 26 depicts generic pathways for the formation of
PBDD/Fs and PXDD/Fs from open bring of BFRs-laden materials and
thermal recycling of e-waste. PBDD/Fs from open burning of do-
mestic waste exhibited similar congener patterns to those observed
from atmospheric sampling [20 , 243] . This clearly indicates that un-
controlled burning contributes significantly to emission inventories
of PBDD/Fs. The yield of PBDD/Fs from open burning was found to
primarily depend on the combustion quality measured by CO/CO

ratio [20] . A linear correlation between overall PBDD/Fs concentra-
tion and CO/CO
2 ratio discloses that formation of PBDD/Fs in open
burning occurs in smouldering combustion rather than in flaming
combustion. To further confirm the dependency of the formation
of PBDD/Fs on the combustion quality, it is suggested to carry out
simulated  open  burning  experiments  under  varying  atmospheric
conditions ranging from lean to rich. A similar bromination pat-
terns  between  congeners  of  PBDEs  and  PBDFs  indicate  that  the
former acts as precursors in the synthesis of PBDFs. The positive
correlation between CO/CO
2 ratio and amount of formed PBDD/Fs
indicate that brominated dioxins most likely originate from a de
novo-like route. However, the questions arise on whether PBDD/Fs
form directly from oxidation of the carbon matrix or originate from
condensation  of  structurally-related  precursors  produced  by  de-
novo synthesis.

Numerous field and laboratory-case studies [244 –248] reported
alarming emission concentrations of PBDD/Fs, PXDD/Fs, and PBDEs
from  burning,  thermal  and  mechanical  recycling  of  e-waste.  Co-
presence of a heterogeneous mixtures of metal halides and oxides
and halogenated hydrocarbon, insufficient oxygen concentrations,
poor mixing conditions, and random temperature profiles collate to
create ideal conditions for the formation of brominated products of
incomplete combustion. These studies universally found that con-
centrations of PBDFs are substantially higher PBDDs; in most cases
by one – two order of magnitude. High PBDFs/PBDDs ratios serves
as a signature for a de novo formation route.

Fujimori et al. [148] utilized a combined approach of statisti-
cal analysis and X-ray absorption fine structure (XFAS) technique
to underpin the role of metallic species in catalysing and halogena-
tion of PBDD/Fs and PCDD/Fs during open burning of e-waste. XFAS
measurements  facilitate  surveying  the  change  of  chemical  forms
of  three  major  metal  pollutants;  Zn,  Cu  and  Zn.  While  materi-
als characterisations did not identify any bromide forms of these
three metals, a plausible correlation was found between concen-
tration of PBDFs and the quantity of CuCl. It was hypothesised that
an electron transfer from PBDEs-intermediate causes a copper re-
duction Cu(II) → Cu(I). We envisage that it might be possible that
metallic species from e-waste burning to mediate fission of an or-
tho  C –H/Br  site  in  PBDEs;  a  rate-determining  step  in  conversion
of  PBDEs  into  PBDFs.  At  the  relatively  low  temperature  encoun-
tered in open burning of e-waste, metallic species most likely to
be partially hydroxylated. Indeed, formation of semiquinone radi-
cals from the interaction of unsubstituted phenol with copper was
attributed to hydroxylated copper surface as evidenced by EPR ab-
sorption spectra [186 , 187] . It is also possible to assume a plausible
role of OH and O − groups in catalysing formation of PBDFs from
PBDEs.

Surface-mediated conversion of PBDEs into PBDFs and PBDDs
may  follow  similar  mechanistic  steps  proposed  for  formation  of
PBDDs  and  PBDFs  from  surface-assisted  coupling  of  bormophe-
nols  and  bromophenoxy  radicals.  Fig.  27  depicts  plausible  path-
ways for surface-mediated formation of PBDD/Fs from PBDEs. The
proposed mechanisms mainly involve HBr elimination via a com-
bination of an aromatic Br with a hydroxyl’s surface H; attachment
of an oxygen surface anion with an ortho site in pre-PBDD/Fs in-
termediate,  surface  bromination,  water  elimination,  ring  closure,
and  desorption.  To  verify  the  occurrence  of  these  mechanism,
it  is  suggested  to  study  the  chemisorbed  and  physisrobed  inter-
action  nature  of  involved  intermediates  by  DRIFT  or  EPR  mea-
surements.  DFT  calculations  could  then  assist  to  acquire  reac-
tion and activation energies. Vibrational frequencies from DFRIFT
spectra  could  now  be  readily  contrasted  with  DFT  predictions
[249] . Likewise, it is insightful to study the surface-assisted cou-
pling of bromophenols into PBDD/Fs over mixed oxide surrogates
rather than individual meatal oxides. The heterogeneous elemen-

tal  composition  in  open  burning  of  e-waste  (Cu,  Fe,  Zn  and  Pd)
entails  the  incorporation  of  several  metal  oxides  and  halides  in
the  fly  ash.  Very  recently,  Potter  et  al.  [250]  illustrated  a  syn-
ergy  between  iron  and  copper  oxides  in  the  catalytic  forma-
tion  of  PCDD/Fs  from  2-chlorophenol.  It  was  demonstrated  that
CuO  affects  the  congener  profile  of  PCDD/Fs  while  Fe
3  influ-
ences  the  yields.  The  interplay  between  various  metal  oxides  in
affecting  the  density  of  active  sites  and  forming  organic-surface
bonds  during  catalytic  formation  of  PBDD/Fs  warrants  further
investigation.

8. Conclusions and future research directions

The  degradation  of  BFRs  is  controlled  by  physical  processes
and chemical reactions. Evaporation contributes significantly to the
weight  loss  of  BFRs  and  their  further  decomposition.  This  phe-
nomenon should be taken into account when designing safer oper-
ational conditions for recycling BFRs-laden materials. The majority
of experimental studies of the thermal decomposition of BFRs have
focused on two aspects: thermal stability behaviour and qualitative
detection  of  products.  Very  few  studies  report  complete  profiles
of  decomposition  products  under  rather  limited  conditions.  The
presence of BFRs in polymeric materials significantly impairs their
thermodynamic stability. On the other hand, hydrogen and hydro-
carbon entities promote BFRs decomposition at lower temperatures
than in neat BFRs. Functional groups of specific polymeric resins
participate in BFRs decomposition.

Pyrolysis or incineration of BFRs-bearing materials establishes
a molecular bromine-rich environment, as evident from pilot-scale
plant experiments and thermodynamic models. This partially ex-
plains the formation of higher brominated PBDD/Fs in comparison
with the low yield of chlorinated PCDD/Fs in thermal systems. In
industrial  thermal  processes,  congener’s  distributions  of  PCDD/Fs
are highly consistent among different emission end-points. This is
in  contrast  to  PBDD/F  profiles  which  exhibit  significant  discrep-
ancies. Incomplete combustion, often encountered during uncon-
trolled incineration of BFRs, promotes PBDD/Fs formation via a pre-
cursor pathway in which structural moieties of several BFRs and
bromophenols serve as building blocks. Formation of PBDD/Fs from
complete destruction of BFRs follows a de novo pathway. In both
homogenous and heterogeneous pathways, the source of bromine
in PBDD/Fs is chiefly of an organic nature. It follows that hetero-
geneous bromination pathways are less prevalent than the dom-
inant  Deacon  reaction  and  direct-surface  chlorination  pathways.
Nonetheless, the high metallic content in e-waste plays a potent
catalysing role in the de novo formation of PBDD/Fs. The univer-
sal dominance of PBDFs over PBDDs indicates a major participa-
tion  of  PBDEs  as  precursors  in  the  formation  of  the  PBDFs.  The
effects  of  polymeric  matrix  on  the  thermal  degradation  of  BFRs
is  far  more  complex  than  merely  serving  as  a  reservoir  for  hy-
drogen atoms. The chemical speciation and phase partitioning of
bromine in combustion system strongly depends on the type and
loads of present metallic species. Abundant hydrogen atoms in py-
rolysis  of  polymers  may  contribute  significantly  in  the  observed
high PBDFs/PBDDs ratios.

Despite of the great deal of experimental and theoretical work
that  has  contributed  to  a  better  understanding  of  the  combus-
tion chemistry of BFRs, there are still many unanswered and in-
triguing questions. In general, the chemical reactions and processes
responsible  for  the  formation  of  PBDD/Fs  and  PXDD/Fs  are  not
as  well  understood  as  those  of  PCDD/Fs.  In  Table  8 ,  we  high-
light  selected  research  gaps  and  suggest  actions  for  addressing
them. Of particular importance is the need to investigate the likeli-
hood for the formation of brominated EPFR from decomposition of
BFRs.

Formation of brominated

Investigation of pure gas phase decomposition of benzene under pyrolytic and oxidative environments enriched with Br 2 and
/or HBr. Yields of brominated benzenes and major brominated products will indicate the efficiency of gas phase routes as
bromination pathways in their own right, without assistance from surface catalysed reactions.
To carry out TGA-based experiments on major types of NBFRs.

Most studies on the decomposition of BFRs target ed their decomposition in the condensed medium. To address gas phase
decomposition, samples of selected BFRs are to be evaporated and introduced into ultra-pure quartz reactor coated with boric
acid.
Apart from TBBA, the influence of polymeric resins on the decomposition behaviour of BFRs has not been thoroughly
investigated.

To provide detailed quantitative measurements for product profiles from the oxidation of neat prominent BFRs.

Decomposition of several BFRs (such as HBCD) does not form bromophenols in appreciable amounts, thus, the formation of
PBDD/Fs from these BFRs most likely originates from a de novo pathway. Careful temperature monitoring for the formation of
PBDD/Fs from TBBA and PBDEs will reveal the contributions of precursor and de novo routes. The former is expected to occur
at low temperatures prior to the complete destruction of BFRs.
Theoretical modelling could readily predict reaction rate constants and formulate mechanistic decomposition steps.

The potential of the occurrence of Ullmann-type reaction during combustion/pyrolysis of aromatic-based BFRs (such as TBBA)
in the presence of metallic species requires investigation. This is important to assess the likelihood for the re-generation of
historically phased-out formulations of PBBs.

Lab-scale combustion experiments on their own right are incapable to simulate the hostile combustion conditions prevailing
in fires (inadequate oxygen content, presence of metals, random mixing of the large number of reactants, unpredictable
pressure, and random temperature profiles). There is a need to carry out cone calorimeter experiments to simulate real fire
conditions with BFR-treated materials and simultaneous measurement of brominated pollutant emissions.
It is suggested to carry out DFRIFT and EPR measurements to monitor formation and stabilisations of brominated EPFR from
brominated phenols and benzenes.

Mohammednoor  Altarawneh  is  a  senior  lecturer  of
chemical engineering at Murdoch University, Perth, Aus-
tralia. He completed his PhD in Physical Chemistry in
2008 from the University of Newcastle, Australia. In his
research, he utilises quantum chemistry and molecular
modelling  to  investigate  formation  and  decomposition
mechanisms  of  halogenated  pollutants  in  thermal  sys-
tems, with a focus on degradation of brominated flame
retardants  and  surface-assisted  coupling  of  precursors.
His other research interests span low-temperature oxida-
tion of aromatic compounds, computational catalysis, and
the combustion chemistry of HO 2 reactions.

Anam Saeed is an Assistant Professor in Chemical En-
gineering Department at University of Engineering and
Technology Lahore, Pakistan. She graduated with Bachelor
and Master’s Degree in Chemical Engineering from Uni-
versity of Engineering and Technology Lahore. She com-
pleted her Ph.D in chemical engineering in 2017 from
Murdoch University, Perth Australia. Her research focuses
on formation of pollutants from fire retardants to unravel
their combustion chemistry and to gain insights into the
environmental consequences pertinent to disposal of ma-
terials laden with flame retardant chemicals, either by re-
cycling or by thermal treatment.

streams. He received several national and international
awards and has more than 60 published scientific paper,

two books and several book chapters.

Bogdan Z. Dlugogorski is a Professor of Engineering and
Dean of Engineering and Information Technology at Mur-
doch University, Perth, Australia. His research interests are
broadly in the areas of process safety, especially in fire
and explosion safety. He investigates fundamental chem-
ical  processes  that  operate  in  fires,  especially  in  phe-
nomena that lead to emission of toxic pollutants from
fires and industrial processes, including ways of prevent-
ing emission of pollutants, mitigation of unwanted fires,
processing of waste to avoid pollutant emission and min-
imising discharge of CO 2 to atmosphere. He is particularly
interested in formation of brominated, chlorinated and
mixed-halogenated dioxins (i.e., PCDD/F, PBDD/F, PXDD/F)
and related molecules, emission of NO x from combustion and explosion processes,
and in storage of CO 2 by mineralisation and utilisation of CO 2 and flammability
properties of chemicals.
