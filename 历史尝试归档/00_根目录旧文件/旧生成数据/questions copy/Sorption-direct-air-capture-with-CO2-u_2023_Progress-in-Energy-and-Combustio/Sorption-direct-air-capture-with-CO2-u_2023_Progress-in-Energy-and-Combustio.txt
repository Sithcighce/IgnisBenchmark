Direct air capture (DAC) is gathering momentum since it has vast potential and high flexibility to collect CO2
from  discrete  sources  as  “synthetic  tree”  when  compared  with  current  CO2  capture  technologies,  e.g.,  amine
based post-combustion capture. It is considered as one of the emerging carbon capture technologies in recent
decades  and  remains  in  a  prototype  investigation  stage  with  many  technical  challenges  to  be  overcome.  The
objective of this paper is to comprehensively discuss the state-of-the-art of DAC and CO2  utilization, note un-
resolved  technology  bottlenecks,  and  give  investigation  perspectives  for  commercial  large-scale  applications.
Firstly, characteristics of  physical and chemical sorbents are evaluated. Then, the representative capture pro-
cesses, e.g., pressure swing adsorption, temperature swing adsorption and other ongoing absorption chemical
loops, are described and compared. Methods of CO2 conversion including synthesis of fuels and chemicals as well
as  biological  utilization  are  reviewed.  Finally,  techno-economic  analysis  and  life  cycle  assessment  for  DAC
application are summarized. Based on research achievements, future challenges of DAC and CO2 conversion are
presented, which include providing synthesis guidelines for obtaining sorbents with the desired characteristics,
uncovering  the  mechanisms  for  different  working  processes  and  establishing  evaluation  criteria  in  terms  of
technical and economic aspects.

1. Introduction

Recent anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gas (GHG) have un-
precedentedly reached the highest level. An increasing concentration of
GHG,  especially  CO2,  is  the  primary  driver  for  global  warming  and
numerous  secondary  effects  [1].  The  total  amount  of  worldwide  CO2
emissions reached 34.17 Gt in 2020, and CO2  concentration in the at-
mosphere increased from a pre-industrial value of 250 ppm to more than
410 ppm [2]. The IPCC has pointed out that the global mean surface
temperature change in the period of 2016–2035 relative to 1986–2005
would likely be in the range of 0.3–0.7 °C [3]. An immediate, rapid and
large-scale reduction in CO2  emissions is necessary, otherwise limiting
warming to 1.5 °C or even 2 °C will be beyond reach [4].

Carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) is considered as an
emerging  technology  to  effectively  mitigate  CO2  emissions  and  its

concentration in ambient air [5]. Conventional CO2  capture technolo-
gies, i.e., pre-combustion, oxy-fuel and post-combustion carbon capture
separate CO2 from large point sources, such as flue gases from coal-fired
power plants [6,7]. Pre-combustion capture implies the removal of CO2
from  fuels  prior  to  combustion  processes.  Typically,  feedstock  is  first
gasified  to  syngas  via  partial  oxidization  or  steam  reformation.  The
relatively high CO2 partial pressure and concentration in the gasifier are
suitable  for  more  efficient  capture  technologies  [8].  In  an  oxy-fuel
combustion  setup,  fossil  fuel  combustion  takes  place  under  nearly
pure O2 atmosphere to reduce the possibility of NOx generation. Nearly
pure  CO2  can  be  directly  subjected  to  sequestration  or  used  via
condensing  out  water  vapour  [9].  Post-combustion  capture  process
separates CO2 from flue gas after fuel combustion in air, which could be
widely applied in existing power plants due to the simplicity of retro-
fitting  and  availability  of  mature  amine  scrubbing  technology  [10].
There  are  several  common  techniques  available  for  post-combustion

CO2  separation,  i.e.,  cryogenic  distillation,  membrane  separation,  ab-
sorption  and  adsorption  [11,12].  Cryogenic  distillation  could  obtain
liquid CO2 which is conducive to transportation and storage though it is
highly energy intensive [13,14]. Membrane separation is cost-effective
but its main limitation is the requirement of high selectivity to extract
a  relatively  low  concentration  CO2  from  flue  gas  [15–18].  Sorption
technologies are the mainstream paths for carbon capture. Absorption is
currently the most developed technology while adsorption can be used
as a viable method with a low energy penalty [19,20].

In  comparison  with  large,  concentrated  carbon  sources  related  to
conventional CO2 capture technologies [21], roughly half of annual CO2
emissions  are  derived  from  distributed  carbon  sources  in  residences,
stores  and  buildings,  especially  in  ambient  air  [22].  To  remove  CO2
already present in the air, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage
(BECCS)  [23]  and direct  air carbon  capture  and storage  (DACCS) are
regarded  as  two  key  technologies  [24–26].  For  BECCS  processes,  at-
mospheric CO2 is removed by growing plants and trees. Biomass can be
burnt  to  generate  heat  and  electricity.  The  majority  of  CO2  released

during  combustion  are  captured  and  sequestered  [27]  or  utilized  to
produce  fuels  [24].  It  has  great  potential  to  achieve  negative  GHG
emissions and compensate for the existing temperature overshoot [28].
However,  land  competition  for  food  production,  water,  and  fertilizer
requirements  as  well  as  CO2  emissions  associated  with  biomass  culti-
vation, harvesting and processing may come with significant social and
environmental impacts [24,28,29].

Direct air capture (DAC) aims to extract CO2 directly from ambient
air. Although DAC has been already adopted in life support systems of
spacecraft and submarines [30], it was not proposed for CO2 extraction
from air to mitigate global warming until 1999 [31]. A remarkable fact
is that DAC can be used to capture CO2 emissions unrelated to its source
and time, i.e., DAC can potentially be deployed anywhere and operated
anytime.  Various  approaches  to  technical  realization  of  DAC  process
have  been  proposed,  amongst  which  the  vast  majority  of  DAC  devel-
opment is based on sorption processes when comprehensively consid-
ering  their  advantages  and  disadvantages  of  energy  penalty,  stability
and cost [22,29]. For sorption DAC, ambient air flows over a sorbent

that selectively removes CO2, which is then released as a concentrated
stream for further use while sorbents are regenerated and CO2-lean air is
returned to the atmosphere. Thus one main challenge is the deteriora-
tion  of  sorbents  due  to  chemical  stability  and  sorption  performance
affected  after  thousands  of  working  cycles  when  exposed  to  large
amounts of air [32]. Another significant challenge for sorption DAC is
the low CO2  concentration in the atmosphere (~400 ppm), which re-
quires large loading sorbents and high specific energy demand in the
regeneration  process.  It  also  targets  for  sorbents  with  high  stability
under  variable  temperature  conditions.  For  sorption  DAC,  working
processes and sorption materials are two key components for high effi-
ciency. The most common methods for gas separation are pressure swing
adsorption  (PSA)  and  temperature  swing  adsorption  (TSA).  PSA  has
become the main process for hydrogen purification and air separation,
but  TSA  is  of  great  interest  for  carbon  capture  owing  to  potential
availability of low-grade thermal energy for the regeneration process of
sorbents  [33].  Considering  low  CO2  levels,  it  is  critical  to  determine
which  process  is  worthy  of  additional  development  to  match  specific
sorbents.  Solid  sorbents,  e.g.,  zeolites,  activated  carbon  (AC),  metal
organic  framework  (MOF), and  amine  modified  materials  are  investi-
gated to further improve their sorption performance in the atmosphere
while chemical sorbents aim to improve their incompatibility with air
[34,35]. Subsequent utilization of the captured CO2 to produce valuable
products can help reduce the net cost of DAC process. Moreover, capital
and  operation  costs  are  equally  vital  for  the  evaluation  of  DAC  tech-
nology. As the technology is at early stage of development, it is chal-
lenging  to  evolve  with  high  costs,  which  would  not  be  economically
competitive  without a  technological breakthrough or  more incentives
[32]. DAC could be predicted to have anticipated needs and opportu-
nities for a large-scale application based on the increasing carbon tax
and carbon neutrality target in many countries.

It is evident that review studies of sorption DAC are rarely reported
due to its more recent emergence [36–40], and previous literature pri-
marily focuses on various types of sorbents. Instead, this work not only
focuses on the latest technological developments of sorption DAC, but
also  aims  to  critically  assess  the  benefits  and  current  challenges  in
combination with CO2 utilization and its potential future perspective. It
provides a holistic context from material evaluation, techno-economic
analysis (TEA) to commercial development. First, a state-of-the-art for
DAC  is  presented.  Sorption  characteristics  of  physical  and  chemical
sorbents are evaluated in Section 2. Then, representative capture pro-
cesses,  e.g.,  physical  adsorption  and  absorption  chemical  loop  are
compared  in  Section  3.  In  Section  4,  methods  of  CO2  conversion

including synthesis of fuels and chemicals as well as biological utiliza-
tion are discussed with particular emphasis on in-situ CO2  conversion.
Economic  and  environment  analysis  are  discussed  for  potential  cost
reduction  and  feasibility  of  sorption  DAC  in  Section  5  which  may  be
reflected to the technical part. Moreover, the commercial development
is initially summarized in Section 6. Based on research achievements,
future challenges and perspectives of sorption DAC are pointed out. To
further clarify the framework of this work, the concerning main com-
ponents  and  landscape  of  sorption  DAC  with  carbon  utilization  are
illustrated in Fig. 1. A bridge of sorption DAC aims to be built from dilute
carbon sources i.e., ambient air, to carbon sinks, i.e., pure compressed
CO2  ready  for  potential  utilization.  Sorption  materials  and  working
processes  are  the  main  basis  to  support  DAC  application.  Life  cycle
assessment (LCA) and TEA are adopted as the important methods for
holistic  evaluation,  which  are  expected  to  achieve  reasonable  carbon
capture costs and economic benefits for potential commercialization.

2. Sorbents for DAC

Since CO2 concentration in ambient air is low, energy consumption
of sorbents is relatively high which is mainly determined by material
types, sorption capacities and CO2 selectivity. Thus, the suitable sorbent
selection  and  development  are  regarded  as  key  for  DAC  application.
Several sorbents have been widely explored, such as zeolite, AC, MOF,
and  alkali  oxides,  etc.  In  general,  sorbents  could  be  classified  into
physical  sorbents  and  chemical  sorbents  based  on  different  sorption
mechanisms. A detailed analysis of sorbents is conducted in two cate-
gories in this section. Composite sorbents are merged into the chemical
sorbent  category  since  chemical  reactions  mainly  contribute  to  their
sorption processes.

2.1. Physical sorbents

CO2  capture  using  physical  sorbents  consumes  less  energy  when
compared  with  chemical  sorbents.  This  is  mainly  because  physical
sorption relies on typically weaker physical interaction of van der Waals
bonds, and no new bond is formed between sorbate and sorbent [12].
Since physical absorbents are rarely reported in DAC applications and
often  accompanied  by  chemical  absorption  processes,  physical  adsor-
bents, e.g., zeolite, AC and MOF are mainly illustrated in this section.

Zeolites:  Zeolites  are  three-dimensional  (3D)  porous  crystalline
aluminosilicates built of a periodic array of TO4 tetrahedra (T = Si or Al),
which have been widely used in gas separation. Aluminium substitution

to  silicon  in  the  lattice  of  zeolite  forms  isomorphism,  resulting  in  a
structure with a net negative charge and a high affinity for quadrupolar
molecules,  e.g.,  CO2  [41].  Na-X,  one  of  low-silica  types  of  zeolite  X
(LSX), has been applied in air pre-purification processes to reduce CO2
emissions.

Based on previous research of using NaX at industrial scale, new high
micro-porosity  LSXs  have  been  investigated  under  laboratory  DAC
(cid:0) 1) was
conditions. An excellent CO2 adsorption capacity (1.34 mmol⋅g
reported for Li-LSX powder in dry air under ambient condition [42]. Bed
breakthrough capacities of various LSXs were measured on pellets that
contained  approximately  15%  binder.  It  is  found  that  Li-LSXs  are
effective  in  a  fixed  bed  adsorber  and  K-LSX  has  the  highest  CO2/N2
selectivity.  This  is  mainly  because  the  lower  specific  surface  area  of
these materials could lead to lower capacity at adsorption breakthrough
point  when  compared  with  pure-component  powder.  In  addition,
moisture in the air will lead to a significant decrease of adsorption ca-
pacity  of zeolite. Besides, faujasite-structured zeolites  such as APG-III
was also investigated and demonstrated to have a high CO2  uptake of
(cid:0) 1  [43].  Except  for  conventional  extrusion  process  for
0.42  mmol⋅g
fabricating  zeolite  monoliths,  3D  techniques  were  used  to  fabricate
complex  geometries  [44].  CO2  adsorption  capacities  of  serval
3D-printed  zeolite  monoliths  were  tested  under  3000  ppm  and  5000
ppm CO2 in N2 at room temperature. Zeolites with different mass ratios
were compared and the results indicated that increasing zeolite/binder
mass  ratio  led  to  a  higher  CO2  adsorption  capacity.  Moreover,  3D
printed technique could possibly be beneficial to systematically tune the
porosity,  zeolite  loading  and  mechanical  strength  of  the  structures of
composite sorbents for DAC.

Although zeolites are mature and economically available, sorption
capacity and selectivity of CO2/N2 are still two challenges of zeolites for
DAC application. Incorporating amine into zeolites to form functional-
ized zeolites would help to improve sorption capacity, which relies on
zeolite  types  [45].  To  overcome  the  decrease  of  adsorption  capacity
under  wet  conditions,  a  desiccant  bed,  e.g.,  silica  gel  or  potassium
substituted zeolite type A (3A) have been used to motivate the pass of
CO2  and  capture  the  moisture  from  the  air  [42,43].  Commonly,  this
solution comes with additional energy input and equipment cost.

Activated  carbon:  Activated  carbon  (AC)  has  a  wide  range  of
available  sources,  which  can  be  produced  from  coals,  industrial  by-
products  and  wood  or  other  biomass  sources.  Higher  CO2  adsorption
capacity of AC could be observed at higher pressures [46,47]. AC has
also drawn great attention for CO2 capture because of its low cost, high
surface  area,  insensitiveness  to  moisture,  easily  tailorable  properties,
good stability and low energy requirements for regeneration [48]. High
surface  area  makes  it  able  to  adsorb  molecules  from  gas  and  liquid
phases because of its highly developed porosity. Low chemical activity
ensures that it does not react with the sorbate and can be easily regen-
erated.  Generally,  types  and  properties  of  AC  depend  on  preparation
methods  and  raw  materials.  Pyrolysis,  activation  temperature  and
holding time are key factors in the preparation processes [49,50]. Bio-
char has been widely studied as a useful adsorbent for CO2 capture in the
flue gas, but it is rarely reported for DAC. Fig. 2 compares the average
sorption  capacity of biochar developed under different pyrolysis tem-
peratures, heating rates and starting concentrations [49]. Biochar pro-
duced  under  control  conditions  by  using  thermogravimetric  analyser
(cid:0) 1)  than
(TGA)  has  better  CO2  sorption  capability  (1.16–3.18  mmol⋅g
(cid:0) 1). Pyrolysis temperature is the
that produced in a furnace (0.15 mmol⋅g
most important contributing factor, while effects of heating rate and CO2
starting concentration are insignificant.

Ability to capture CO2  directly from the atmosphere requires more
selective and higher CO2 binding affinities. Recent studies have reported
several  effective  strategies  to  improve  CO2  binding  affinities  for  AC:
polymers are used as precursors to prepare carbon-based CO2 adsorbents
with desirable properties which have been identified as a useful tech-
nique  [51].  Phenolic  resins  are  the  most  used  polymer  to  prepare
carbon-based CO2 adsorbent due to its relatively low costs. It has been

furnace (data from [49]).

demonstrated  that  under  the  condition  of  atmospheric  pressure  and
room temperature, CO2 capture capacities of the phenolic resins-based
AC could reach up to 10.8 wt.%, but they are significantly lower than
those at 25 bar and 25 °C [52]. Although super-high surface area of AC
leads to greater adsorption capacities at high pressure, lower capacities
at low pressures and poor selectivity for CO2  and N2  makes it not that
suitable to be applied for DAC [12].

Metal organic framework (MOF): As a research hotspot in crystal-
line porous materials, MOFs consist of metal-containing nodes linked by
organic  ligand  bridges  and  are  formed  by  strong  coordination  bonds
[53]. Compared to zeolites, rigid and divergent character of the added
linker makes it easier to tailor apparent surface area and pore volume
through  control  of  pore  architecture  and  linker  functionalization.
Modification  of  MOFs  has  been  investigated  from  the  replacement  of
linkers or metal ligands and synthesis methods.

CO2  adsorption  through  MOFs  is  pore  size/volume  and  surface
dependant. To enhance CO2  uptake and selectivity at very low partial
pressure relevant to DAC, a 2-D square grid MOF (SIFSIX-3-Cu) with a
pyrazine/copper  (II)  connected  by  silicon  hexafluoride  anions  was
constructed  [54].  A  large  CO2  uptake  is  observed  when  using
(cid:0) 1) at 298 K adsorption temperature and 0.4
SIFSIX-3-Cu (1.24 mmol⋅g
mbar partial pressure. High CO2 selectivity of this material is a result of
tuning pore size and interaction energy to allow physical capture of CO2
from ultra-dilute CO2  concentration sources such as air. Thus, a struc-
tural analysis of SIFSIX-3-X adsorbents was conducted to pinpoint key
structural features responsible for unique CO2  capture properties [55].
was  proposed  to  replace  original  inorganic  pillar  (SiF6)2(cid:0)
(NbOF5)2(cid:0)
existing in SIFSIX-3-X. Significantly, the product NbOFFIVE-1-Ni offers
an even higher CO2 uptake at 400 ppm than SIFSIX-3-Cu. The result of
2(cid:0)
changing  the  pillar  from  SiF6
leads  to  the  enhanced
CO2-sorbent  interactions  and  higher  selectivity  [56].  TIFSIX-3-Ni  was
found to perform very competitively when compared with the bench-
mark NbOFFIVE-1-Ni. Five benchmark adsorbents that encompass one
chemical sorbent (TEPA-SBA-15),  four physical sorbents (zeolite 13X,
HKUST-1,  Mg-MOF-74  and  SIFSIX-3-Ni)  were  compared  and  investi-
gated their ability to adsorb CO2  directly from air [57]. It was demon-
(cid:0) 1)
strated that SIFSIX-3-Ni has the largest CO2  uptake (0.182 mmol⋅g
amongst physical sorbents, while much lower than that of TEPA-SBA-15
(cid:0) 1). Fig. 3 shows a good long-time stability of these sor-
(3.591 mmol⋅g
bents  when  exposed  to  a  controlled  humidity  chamber.  It  could  be
deduced  that  two  kinds  of  MOFs  (HKUST-1  and  Mg-MOF-74)  are
impaired  by  exposure
to  humidity.  Sorption  performance  of
TEPA-SBA-15, zeolite 13X and SIFSIX-3-Ni are relatively stable after a

replacing original inorganic pillar SiF6
NbOFFIVE-1-Ni  performs  better  than  SIFSIX-3-Cu  under  the  same
testing  conditions.  Although  there  is  a  slight  difference  in  the  testing
temperature, moisture in the air still leads to the decrease of adsorption
capacity of SIFSIX-3-Cu. It is indicated that only a few kinds of MOFs
have a satisfactory performance under DAC conditions due to the ultra-
dilute CO2  concentration. amongst physical adsorbents, MOFs are the
most promising materials due to its high modification flexibility.

2.2. Chemical sorbents

Compared  with  physical sorbents,  the  presence  of  chemical bonds
between sorbents and sorbates results in a strong affinity to capture CO2,
which  makes  chemical  sorbents  more  attractive  for  DAC.  Solid  alkali
sorbents, amine-modified solid sorbents and liquid chemical absorbents
are three main categories of chemical sorbents [60].

Solid  alkali  sorbents:  Alkali  metal  oxides  react  with  CO2  to  form
carbonate or bicarbonate in the presence of water. Due to commercial
availability  and  low  price,  CaO-based  sorbents  have  been  extensively
used  for  CO2  separation.  The  basic  carbonation-calcination  reversible
reaction occurs according to Eq. (1). The carbonation process is operated
at  365–400  °C  while  calcination  is  operated  at  800–875  °C.  Steam  is
added to the carbonation step to enhance its reaction rate through for-
mation of intermediate Ca(OH)2  [61,62]. CaO hydration (Eq. (2)) and
overall carbonation reaction of Ca(OH)2 (Eq. (3)) are shown as follows.

CaO + CO2⇌CaCO3

CaO + H2O⇌Ca(OH)2

Ca(OH)2+CO2⇌CaCO3 + H2O

(1)

(2)

(3)

Carbonation  of  CaO  normally  requires  high  temperature  to  effec-
tively  remove  CO2.  To  improve  CO2  capture  capability  of  CaO-based
materials  under  ambient  conditions,  pre-hydrated  lime  in  DAC  was
explored [63]. It is demonstrated that introducing steam into calcination
[64,65]  or  carbonation  [63,66]  process  has  a  positive  effect  on  DAC
performance.  Carbonation  conversion  ratio  is  more  than  50%  after
pre-hydration of CaO [67]. Two main phenomena cause faster carbon-
ation of hydrated lime than that of lime at initial stage: more non-bound
water  contained  in  the  hydrated  lime  promotes  CO2  dissolution  at
gas/solid interface; cracks in the sorbents since formation of Ca(OH)2
exposes internal unreacted lime for further carbonation. In the presence
of water, CaCO3 formed on the surface of CaO could be converted to Ca
(HCO3)2, which breaks the protection of CaCO3 layer and enhances CO2
diffusion through bulk of particles [67].

M-based alkali metal oxides/carbonates (M denotes Na or K) can also
be applied for CO2  capture [68,69]. Three independent variables, i.e.,
temperature, partial pressure of CO2  and partial pressure of H2O have
influence on the reactions between alkali metals and CO2. The chemical
reactions can be expressed as Eqs. (4)-(5):

M2O + CO2⇌M2CO3

M2CO3+CO2 + H2O⇌2MHCO3

(4)

(5)

Alkali carbonates loaded into porous matrices are studied to over-
come  the  problem  of  low  carbonation  rates  under  ultra-dilute  CO2
concentration in the air. K2CO3 has been widely introduced to different
porous substrates [70–74]. With the presence of CO2, K2CO3  is further

humid conditions, K2CO3  undergoes hydration reaction where the un-
stable  product  potassium  carbonate  sesquihydrate  (K2CO3⋅1.5H2O)  is
formed as indicated in Eq. (7). Final product KHCO3 is rapidly produced
as shown in Eq. (8).

Zeolite  powder  has  the  higher  adsorption  capacity  than  zeolite  pellet

only has a satisfactory capacity at high pressure. It is desirable for AC to
have  a  high  sorption  capacity  and  selectivity  under  the  conditions  of

which results in lower energy and process cost. Features like strong af-
finity for binding with CO2, and high tolerance to humidity make amine-
sorbents attractive [41].

Composite sorbents K2CO3/γ-Al2O3  absorb CO2  through the forma-
tion  of  crystalline KHCO3  and  nano-dispersed KAlCO3(OH)2  phase  on
the  surface  of  γ-Al2O3  under  DAC  conditions  [70].  KHCO3  phase  and
intermediate K2CO3⋅KHCO3⋅1.5H2O phase would convert to K2CO3 at a
temperature higher than 200 °C. Potassium dawsonite KAlCO3(OH)2 is
formed as a result of the reaction between K2CO3  and Al2CO3, and its
thermal  destruction  is  not  complete  until  heated  up  to  300  °C  [71].
Therefore, a significant heat consumption is required for its regenera-
tion. Based on Y2O3  porous matrix, experimental sorption capacity re-
mains relatively stable during the first 20 cycles [73]. A K-Y interaction
like  K-Al  is  formed  in  K2CO3/Y2O3  composite  sorbent.  Compared  to
Al2O3  matrix, introduction of ZrO2  aerogel matrix eliminates negative
influence  of  intermediate  KAlCO3(OH)2,  contributing  to  a  higher
transformation rate of K2CO3 to KHCO3 and higher CO2 adsorption ca-
pacity [74]. Thermal pre-treatments of granular γ-Al2O3 were conducted
to  increase  the  percentage  of  K2CO3  involved  in  transformation  to
KHCO3  [72]. When heat treatment temperature increases from 450 to
750 °C, increasing dynamic sorption capacity may be related to mass
transfer enhancement in the larger pore.

Inorganic supported materials, e.g., AC were proposed to avoid for-
mation  of  by-products when  using metal-based matrices [75].  Perfor-
mance of alkali metal salts is significantly influenced by the moisture in
air. K2CO3 supported on AC honeycomb will produce K2CO3⋅1.5H2O or
aqueous solution according to different RHs [75]. Aqueous solution was
formed due to deliquescence on the surface of Al2O3 when RH is above
43% [76], speeding up the formation of KAlCO3(OH)2 and reducing CO2
sorption  capacity  [72].  Evaporation  of  the  solution  generates  a  local
cooling effect which is beneficial to CO2 adsorption. Adsorption capac-
ities  under  different  experimental  conditions  using  K2CO3/AC  are
compared in Fig. 4. Adsorption capacity decreases with the increase of
adsorption  temperature  and  water  vapour  pressure.  It  is  initially
demonstrated  that  increasing  moisture  in  the  gas  mixture  would  be
beneficial  to  the  carbonation  of  K2CO3⋅1.5H2O.  However,  it  could  be
inferred from Eq. (8) that increased moisture would make reaction shift
to  the  left  and  inhibit  capture  process.  Replacing  K2CO3  with
pre-hydrated  Na2CO3  results  in  a  similar  cooling  effect  [77].  Due  to
negative effect of reactions between support material and alkali sorbent,
their  interrelation  should  be  investigated  to  improve  adsorption  per-
formance under DAC conditions.

Amine-modified solid sorbents: Amines supported on matrices are
popular  materials  for  flue  gas  carbon  capture  and  are  gathering  mo-
mentum in DAC applications. Compared to solid metal-based sorbents,
amine-modified  sorbents  have  quite  low  regeneration  temperature,

Fig.  4. CO2  adsorption  capacities  under  different  adsorption  temperatures,
water vapour pressure and volumetric air flow rates (data from [75]).

Mechanisms of amines-modified sorbents for CO2 capture are based
on acid-base reaction: primary and secondary amines react with CO2 to
form carbamate or  bicarbonate through a  zwitterion mechanism, and
tertiary amines react with CO2  in the presence of water to form bicar-
bonate [78]. Theoretical amine efficiency is usually defined by molar
CO2/N  ratio  [37].  Amine-modified  sorbents  are  classified  into  three
classes as shown in Fig. 5 [79]: (1) Class 1, physically loading amines
into porous materials; (2) Class 2, amines are covalently bound to the
surface of porous materials, e.g., via use of organosilanes; (3) Class 3,
prepared by in-situ covalent polymerization of amine on porous mate-
rials.  Hyperbranched  aminosilica  (HAS)  materials  [79]  and  poly
(L-lysine) brush/mesoporous silica hybrid material [80] are promising
Class 3 CO2 adsorbents.

Quite a few studies on DAC using amines based on different supports,
e.g., mesoporous silica, alumina, MOFs, have been reported. Silica is the
most  common  support  for  solid  amine  sorbents,  but  suffers  from
degradation  in  the  presence  of  steam  and  poor  cyclic  stability.  Intro-
duction of stable additives on silica composite adsorbent was proposed
by  Choi  et  al.  [81].  With  silane  and  titanium  propoxide  additives,
modified polyethyleneimine (PEI) samples presented higher decompo-
sition temperatures and enhanced thermal stability over multiple TSA
cycles. amongst three types of amines, primary amines show significant
performance  enhancements  by  correlated  silanes  [78].  Efficiencies  of
primary amines are more than twice of secondary amines at 25 °C, while
tertiary  amines  have  no  amine  efficiency  owing  to  negligible  CO2
adsorption. For highly loaded primary amines, adsorption efficiencies
can  reach  0.3,  even  under  dry  air  capture  conditions.  Moreover,  it  is
evident that primary amines enhance the hydrophilicity of the adsor-
bent,  whereas  secondary  or  tertiary  amines  cause  the  materials  more
hydrophobic  than  bare  support.  Mesoporous  silica  especially  SBA-15
[80,82-84]  is  feasible  as  supported  materials  for  DAC  because  of  its
structural  properties  of  high  pore  volume,  large  pore  size  and  thick
walls. Silica gels are also commercially available sorbent with controlled
qualities  and  substantially  lowest  costs.  They  can  be  readily  used  for
amine  grafting  and  fixed-bed  adsorption  without  pre-synthesis  to  be
pellets [85].

It is important to determine locations of amine sites for CO2 working
capacity  enhancement  based  on  adsorption  mechanisms.  Because  of
moisture in the air, water effect on CO2 adsorption sites is a key factor
that needs to be considered. Pre-humidified adsorbents are available to
form  bicarbonate,  thus  increasing  amine  efficiency,  whereas  dry  sor-
bents accumulate water over time. Also, polymer network loosened by
water  allows  enhanced  CO2  penetration  to  some  extent  [86],  and  in-
hibits  the  formation  of  stable  urea  and  imidazolidinone  species  [87].
However, an excess of humidity or extreme hydrophilicity has a negative
impact on CO2 adsorption if water condenses in pores and blocks access
of  CO2  to  the  sites  [78].  Capture  capacity  of  PEI/PME(40)  (PME  =
layer  of  cetyl-
pore-expanded  silica  MCM-41  with  a  surface
trimethylammonium  cations)  is  increased  by  33.7%  from  5.4  to  7.31
(cid:0) 1 upon humidification of 400 ppm CO2/N2 feed gas to 64% RH
mmol⋅g
[87].  Humidity  has  a  predominant  effect  on  adsorption  capacity  of
polymer/silica fibre sorbents, which increases equilibrium CO2 capacity
(cid:0) 1,  approximately  2.5  times  higher  than  the  capacity
to  1.6  mmol⋅g
under  dry  conditions  [88].  Wet-grafted  silica  gels  W-AG-150A  shows

grafting synthesis procedure [85].

Alumina  supports  show  more  tolerance  to  steam  treatments  than
silica, which are the preferred supports for practical DAC applications.
Mesoporous  alumina  possesses  a  large  pore  volume,  3D  connected
mesopores and good hydrothermal stability. Alumina surface contains
both acidic and basic sites, which are alterable by preparation and post-
treatment  procedures  [89].  Owing  to  its  amphoteric  nature,  alumina

supports present more active CO2  sorption than silica supports, poten-
tially directly participating in the adsorption process [90]. As shown in
Fig. 6, when no amine is loaded on bare Al2O3  supports (D-Al2O3  and
O-Al2O3), the supports all behave as an initial CO2  uptake under DAC
conditions. The modified amine efficiency (A.E.) considers adsorption
sites in Al2O3  supports which is compared with the traditional amine
efficiency. With a high amine loading, actual amine efficiency might be
closer  to  the  traditional  amine  efficiency,  but  when  amine  loading  is
low,  adsorption  effect  of  bare  Al2O3  support  exceeded  that  of  amine.
Performance  of  PEI  loaded  on  monolithic  and  power  alumina  were
investigated  by  using  TGA  [91].  With  a  low  PEI  loading,  the  powder

sample has a higher capacity. Comparably, monolithic sample performs
better with a high PEI loading. In addition, monoliths show worse ki-
netics  by  breakthrough  experiments.  This  may  result  from  the  differ-
ences in the thickness of PEI layers or due to the fact that monolithic
samples have greater characteristic lengths. A novel PEI-functionalized
Mg-Al mixed metal  oxides (MMO) exhibited higher  CO2-uptake (2.27
(cid:0) 1), and high stability at 25
mmol⋅g
°C under 0.4 mbar CO2 due to ideal morphologies and nanostructures of
their supports [92]. With a high PEI loading ratio, polyamines start to
cover  MMO  frameworks  but  porous  structure  is  still  maintained  and
amine  efficiency  is  not  significantly  decreased.  Another  Mg-Al  MMO

MOFs with textural flexibility and high BET surface are desirable as
amines  supports.  However,  weak  physical  interaction  between  MOFs
and  CO2  results  in  unfavourable  adsorption  capacities  and  moderate
CO2/N2  selectivity.  A  variety  of  open  metal  sites  in  some  families  of
MOFs, e.g., M2(dobpdc) (M = Mg, Mn, Zn, Ni, Co, Fe, dobpdc4(cid:0) = 4,4
-
′
-biphenyldicarboxylate)  enable  selective  post-synthesis
dioxido-3,3
modification  to  enhance  the  selectivity  of  gas  adsorption  [94].  Func-
tionalization of MOFs with amines can improve CO2 adsorption capacity
and cyclic stability. Two representative MOF materials are Mg2(dobpdc)
[95–97] and MIL-101(Cr) [94]. Post-synthesis amine functionalization
of modified Mg/DOBDC (DOBDC = 2,5-dioxido-1,4-benzenedicarboxy-
late) was implemented to create an adsorbent with CO2 adsorption ca-
pacity and improved material stability under DAC operating conditions
[95]. Functionalization of the framework was carried out by grafting of
ethylenediamine  onto  dehydrated  Mg/DOBDC  in  anhydrous  toluene
under reflux for 12 h, which formed amine-modified composite adsor-
bent ED-Mg/DOBDC. Amine modified ED-Mg/DOBDC indicates the best
cyclic  adsorption  performance  amongst  common  adsorbents.  Another

Adsorption capacity of composite is 2.05 mmol⋅g
mbar CO2 partial pressure. The easily accessed amine mmen-2 leads to
faster  adsorption  kinetics  and  enhanced  adsorption  rates.  A  new
diamine-functionalized MOFs was obtained when using 1-en amine (en
= ethylenediamine) [97]. CO2 capacity of en-Mg2(dobpdc) at 0.39 mbar
(cid:0) 1, which is larger than that of mmen-Mg2(dobpdc) by a
is 2.83 mmol⋅g
factor of 1.4 [96]. For TSA cycle, saturation amount of en-Mg2(dobpdc)
is increased by 1.5 times relative to capacity of mmen-Mg2(dobpdc). Tris
(2-amino ethyl) (TREN) is used as amine component on MIL-101(Cr),
(cid:0) 1  at 0.4 mbar partial pressure could be
and CO2 uptake of 2.8 mmol⋅g
achieved [94]. However, sorption capacity is significantly decreased in
stable  cyclic  CO2  adsorption  test,  which  can  be  attributed  to  high
volatility of TREN. Recently, Guo et al. [98] reported a highly efficient
and  stable  composite  of  polyacrylate  (PA)  and  NbOFFIVE-1-Ni.  CO2
(cid:0) 1  under the
adsorption capacity of PA/NbOFFIVE-1-Ni is 1.44 mmol⋅g
condition of 400 ppm of CO2/N2 and 298 K, which exceeds the capacity
of 1.3 mmol⋅g

(cid:0) 1 obtained by NbOFFIVE-1-Ni.

Table  2  summarizes  various  amine-modified  adsorbents  based  on
different matrices. It is demonstrated that PEI is the most common amine
used in amine-modified adsorbents for DAC. When compared to physical
adsorbents,  amine  modified  materials  exhibit  excellent  performance

under  DAC  conditions.  Amines  loaded  on  supports  are  an  effective
method to avoid high energy demand of aqueous amine solution. Be-
sides, amines and supports can adsorb CO2  at the same time, which is
subject to adsorption sites on supports. When using physical sorbents
like  zeolites  as support  materials, moisture  in the  air significantly  in-
fluences  the  performance  of  composite  sorbents.  However,  effects  of
water on CO2  adsorption using amines still need to be further investi-
gated. The detailed mechanisms are more complex than those of phys-
ical  sorbents  [99].  There  are  three  governing  mechanisms:  amine
efficiency  increases  from  0.5  to  1  in  the  presence  of  water;  water  in-
fluences  adsorption  heat  of  amine  modified  sorbents;  adsorbed  water
molecules  block  amine  sites  and  hinders  CO2  adsorption.  Besides,
co-adsorption mechanism of CO2 on amines and support materials is still
not clear.

Liquid chemical absorbent: Amine scrubbing technology is the most
mature technology to separate CO2 from natural gas and flue gas [103].
It is acknowledged that aqueous amines including monoethanolamine
(MEA), diethanolamine (DEA) and methyldiethanolamine (MDEA) are
the most widely used amines for CO2 absorption [104]. Amine solutions
have the advantages of high reaction rate, reasonable CO2  absorption
capacity and low cost. Nonetheless, the main disadvantages for amine
solutions  are  its  high  regeneration  heat  and  oxidative  degradation
[105]. High regeneration energy consumption mainly comes from sen-
sible heat loss of water. Thus water-lean or water-free chemical absor-
bent  have  drawn  lots  of  attentions  [106–108].  Potential  amine
degradation leads to solvent loss, equipment corrosion and generation of
volatile  degradation  compounds,  which  may  be  harmful  to  human
health  and  the  environment  [10].  To  efficiently  absorb  CO2  from
ultra-dilute ambient air stream, appropriate materials are required to be
stable  enough  and  less  energy  intensive  [109].  Aqueous  unhindered
primary  amines  were  reported  as  the  most  suitable  sorbents  for  DAC
processes and as efficient as aqueous alkali hydroxides [110]. They are
potential  energy  savings  with  relatively  high  efficiency  due  to  lower
temperatures for sorbent regeneration. Amine blends have the particu-
larity  to  combine  each  advantage  and  may  have  better  performance
under DAC conditions [104]. In addition, ionic liquids [111,112] and
phase  changing absorbents [113,114] have also been  investigated for
DAC.

Alkali solutions as solvents are very attractive since the solutions are
less  expensive  and  more  stable  [115].  Moreover,  compared  to  amine
solutions,  they  have  relatively  low  reaction  heat,  which  lead  to  low
regeneration energy cost [116]. Advantages of aqueous hydroxide so-
lutions employed in CCUS include [117]: (1) hydroxides can be easily
obtained via electrolysis of aqueous salts; (2) higher efficiency for car-
bon capture from ambient air; (3) hard to volatilize; (4) low toxicity; (5)
easy  to  regenerate.  Similar  with  CaO-based  sorbents,  using  Ca(OH)2
solution to remove CO2  from ambient air starts with carbonation, fol-
lowed by calcination of CaCO3  and regeneration of Ca(OH)2  solution,
which can be described as Eqs. (9)-11, respectively [31]:

Ca(OH)2+CO2⇌CaCO3 + H2O

CaCO3⇌CaO + CO2

CaO + H2O⇌Ca(OH)2

(9)

(10)

(11)

However, low solubility of Ca(OH)2  in water limits hydroxide con-
centration which is the main factor to bind CO2. Aqueous solutions using
other  alkali  metals,  e.g.,  potassium  hydroxide  (KOH)  or  sodium  hy-
droxide  (NaOH)  have  also  been  proposed  in  DAC  processes.  Their
regeneration  loops  are  always accompanied  with  Ca(OH)2, which  are
very  similar to Kraft caustic recovery cycle that is commonly  used in
paper mill/pulp industry as shown in Fig. 7 [118]. Four steps of Kraft
cycle for DAC are shown as follows:

Step 1: CO2  sorption via an acid-based reaction to form carbonates

(Eq. (12)),

Step 2: CaCO3 precipitation and the regeneration of NaOH (Eq. (13)),

Fig. 7. Schematic diagram of Kraft process for DAC (adapted from [118]).

Step 3: The release of CO2 from CaCO3 through calcination (600–900

°C) (Eq. (9)),

Step 4: The regeneration of Ca(OH)2 (Eq. (14)).

2NaOH + CO2⇌Na2CO3 + H2O

Na2CO3+Ca(OH)2⇌CaCO3+2NaOH

CaO + H2O⇌Ca(OH)2

(12)

(13)

(14)

Enthalpy  differences  of  the  four  steps  are  shown  in  Fig.  8.  It  is
indicated that CaCO3  calcination requires a large amount of energy to
break  strong  calcium  carbonate  bonds.  Energy  consumption  can  be
provided by natural gas burnt either in air or gas [119]. High temper-
ature of calcination process would increase temperature gap between
burning kiln and the environment, which leads to a large amount of heat
loss.

to  excellent  efficiency  of  electrochemical

Unlike amines, metal carbonate/bicarbonate can be easily regener-
ated  and  release  captured  CO2  by  an  electrolysis  process.  Therefore,
electrochemical  regeneration  of  alkali  sorbents  has  been  investigated
due
reaction  and
environmental-benign characteristic [120]. An electrochemical system
was proposed for selective recovery of LiOH from the used CO2  adsor-
bents  as  shown  in  Fig.  9  [121].  The  system  is  a  two-electrode  cell
separated  by  a  cation  exchange  membrane  (CEM).  As  the  current  is
applied to the cell, water decomposition reaction takes place and CO2 is
released by the combination of protons with carbonate or bicarbonate.
Results  indicate  that  current  density  and  cationic  load  ratio  have  an
influence  on  the  performance  of  electrical  systems.  An  equilibrium
model also demonstrates the existence of simultaneous solvent regen-
eration and CO2  desorption at an identical steady state [122]. Regen-
(cid:0) 1.
eration heat of the system could be achieved as low as 164 kJ⋅mol
CEM is not the only option for the electrochemical regeneration of sol-
vents. Bipolar membrane electrodialysis (BPMED) combined with wet
scrubbing was applied in a DAC process [123,124]. Energy consumption
for  K2CO3  calculated  from  BPMED  model  presents  a  minimum  value
when the efficiency and voltage drop achieve a trade-off. Such low en-
ergy consumption is in line with other regeneration strategies proposed
for DAC, it shows that electrochemical processes could be a competitive
alternative amongst all DAC technologies.

Except the above absorption process for DAC, moisture swing was
proposed as a new approach to regenerate CO2 sorbents [125]. It trades
heat input in thermal swing, or mechanical energy in a pressure-based
swing against water consumption, whose evaporation provides the po-
tential  to  drive  the  cycle,  while  energy  consumption  by  evaporation
comes from the low-moisture atmosphere. Later, their team developed
an amine-based anion exchange resin in a flat sheet of polypropylene
[126].  Quaternary  ammonium  cations  are  attached  to  the  polymer
structure.  Original  exchangeable  anions  on  resin  are  chloride  ions,
which could be replaced by hydroxide or carbonate ions to absorb CO2.
The resin can absorb CO2 under dry conditions and release it under wet
conditions, which offers an opportunity for regeneration via moisture
swing  process.  Schematic  diagram  of  reaction  pathway  is  shown  in

Fig.  10.  Based  on  quantum  mechanics  simulation,  capture  systems
energetically prefer bicarbonate and hydroxide ions to carbonate ions
when exposed to dry air. Thus, high content of hydroxide ions is more
conductive  for  CO2  absorption  [127].  The  resin  absorbs  CO2  until  all
hydroxide  is  consumed,  reaching  bicarbonate  state  [126].  The  resin
shows a very high saturation rate over 99% for hydroxide and carbonate
at  400  ppm  CO2  level  and  0.5%  water  vapour  concentration  [128].
Wang et al. [129] further developed a modified shrinking core model to
evaluate  the  effects  of  ambient  conditions  and  sorbents  structure  on
absorption  kinetics.  Diffusion  coefficient  and  chemical  reaction  rate
reveal significant drop with decreased temperature or increased relative
humidity. It is indicated that poor performance of the sorbent in cold
and  humid  weather.  To  overcome  weak  tolerance  of  quaternary
ammonium-based  sorbents,  bamboo  fibre  was  quaternized  and
compared  to  the  reported  moisture-swing  absorbents  [130].  CO2  ca-
pacity is negligible under dry conditions and is increased with RH to the
(cid:0) 1.  Results  also  demonstrate  that  an
maximum  value  of  0.19  mmol⋅g
extremely low (< 20%) or high (>90%) RH are not favoured for CO2
capacity.  In  contrast,  moisture  swing  driven  absorbents  require  less
energy to be regenerated, but with lower sorption capacity.

In summary, not all sorbents are suitable for DAC, and several are
still facing great challenges with regard to real applications. For physical
adsorbents, zeolites, AC and MOFs have their own advantages and dis-
advantages  for  DAC  application.  Activated  carbon  has  lower  CO2
adsorption capacities when compared with zeolites at lower pressure.
Zeolites  and  AC  are  easily  available  and  well-developed,  but  poor

sorption capacities and selectivity are their weaknesses. MOFs have high
flexibility  in  shape,  pore  structure,  pore  size,  and  surface  properties.
However, their preparation and modification are troublesome, instable
and  expensive  which  also  have  the  issues  of  toxic  raw  materials.
Generally, the presence of moisture in the air will significantly decrease
the amount of CO2 uptake of physical sorbents and lead to larger energy
input  for  adsorbents  regeneration.  For  some  types  of  physical  adsor-
bents, working capacity could be improved in the presence of less water
while more water inhibits its performance. amongst physical adsorbents,
zeolites are proposed to be the most appropriate candidate in the near
future.  The  enhanced  mechanism  of  low  Si/Al  ratios  on  high  CO2
adsorption capacities under low pressure conditions have been investi-
gated using simulation methods [131,132]. Thus, how to improve the
performance  of  zeolites  under  low  CO2  partial  pressure  and  humid
conditions is the main barrier that restricts their large-scale application.
The key is to understand the influence of water on binary sorption of CO2
and  H2O  [133,134].  Comparably,  for  solid  alkali  sorption  materials,
amine modified adsorbents are regarded to be the most suitable mate-
rials  for  DAC  applications  due  to  the  high  working  capacity  and  low
regeneration  rate.  To  take  advantage  of  supported  amines,  future
research  may  focus  on  co-adsorption  mechanism  of  materials.  Liquid
chemical absorbents take advantage of high reaction and low cost due to
liquid-gas mass transfer process. The disadvantages of high regeneration
cost  and  oxidative  degradation  should  be  overcome  if  it  is  aimed  for
large  DAC  applications.  Some  absorbents,  e.g.,  ionic  liquids,  have  an
improved  working  capacity  in  presence  of  less  water  and  the  perfor-
mance is hindered with more water. Thus water-lean or water-free ab-
sorbents are more desirable in the future. Table 3 conducts a general
comparison of different sorbents for DAC.

3. Capture process for DAC

Based  on  previous  researches  in  post-combustion  carbon  capture
[11], capture processes for sorption DAC can be also classified according
to  adsorption  or  absorption  mechanisms.  For  adsorption  processes,
common capture processes include TSA, PSA, vacuum swing adsorption
(VSA), electric swing adsorption (ESA) and hybrid processes [135]. For
absorption, chemical loop is commonly investigated and mainly focuses
on different methods of regeneration step.

3.1. Adsorption/desorption process

Pressure swing adsorption (PSA): PSA processes are mainly applied
to  remove  a  strongly  adsorbed  impurity  from  a  gas  mixture.  In  pre-
combustion  and  post-combustion  process,  CO2  is  a  strongly  adsorbed
component when compared to other major components, e.g., N2  [136,
137]. It is a reliable method for CO2  separation from flue gas streams
with 5–15 vol.% CO2 [138]. For PSA, CO2 is adsorbed at high pressure,
and  desorbed  from  adsorbent  around  atmospheric  pressure  which
mainly includes four steps: pressurization, adsorption, depressurization
and purge [137,139]. Schematic diagrams of PSA are shown in Fig. 11.
Fig.  11a  indicates  the  above  working  process.  The  thermal  cycle  is
described  as  Fig.  11b,  where  the  adsorption  isothermal  curve  reflects
CO2 partial pressure and adsorption capacity. The detailed thermal cycle
is illustrated as follows [140]:

Pressurization  (1–2,  PRE):  CO2  partial  pressure  is  increased  from
atmospheric pressure Pint to Pad by an air compressor. Then compressed
air  is  aerated  in  the  adsorption  reactor  to  generate  a  high-pressure
adsorption atmosphere. Adsorption (2–3, AD): High pressure air enters
the reactor, while CO2 is selectively adsorbed by adsorbent, leaving N2-
rich air to flow out. CO2 adsorption process and the venting of N2-rich
waste gas are both assumed to be instantaneously completed. Depres-
surization (3–4–5, DP): The vent valve opens and allows high-pressure
air expanding to atmospheric pressure. Desorbed CO2  and unabsorbed
gas in the reactor leave adsorption reactor. Since CO2 desorption is not
completed,  a  further  purge  step  is  needed  to  obtain  additional  CO2

product. Purge  (5–1, PUR): CO2  is  desorbed and  discharged  from the
reactor with carrier purge gas at atmospheric pressure. A next adsorp-
tion thermal cycle starts until reaching the initial state, i.e., point 1.

Performance of CO2 separation is typically evaluated by CO2 purity
and recovery, which depends on the amount of desorbed CO2 and feed
CO2. Due to the limit of external conditions, e.g., structure of adsorption
reactor, mass transfer resistance during adsorption and dead volume in
the system, efficiency of adsorption reactor (φun) could be estimated by
unused percentage of the reactor [141]. Energy required for a real DAC
process should be compared with theoretical minimum separation work
(Wmin)  by  a  completely  reversible  process  under  the  same  working
condition. Assuming air as an ideal gas mixture, theoretical minimum
work required for capturing per mole of CO2  could be defined as Eq.
(15).

According  to  carbon  pump  concept  [142],  the  minimum  separation
work is only related to initial and final state of separation process, which
depends on feed gas temperature, CO2 fraction and recovery rate.

Vacuum swing adsorption (VSA): VSA is a particular case of PSA, of
which adsorption takes place at atmospheric pressure, while desorption/
regeneration process occurs under vacuum. VSA applications avoid the
use of several traditional modules in PSA, e.g., air compressor, process
valves,  associated  dryers  and  feed  air  filtering  systems.  The  lower
operating pressure reduces water condensation, which allows operation
in humid air and provides a superior regeneration of sorbents. Energy
consumption for VSA are around 50% of PSA due to the fact that air
compressor is not used [11]. At the relatively low gas pressure, VSA is
the most economical adsorption technique to handle flue gas with CO2
concentration from 15% to 55% [143].

Pressure-vacuum swing adsorption (PVSA): PVSA is a combination
of PSA and VSA, i.e., its adsorption step occurs at pressures above at-
mospheric  pressure  while  the  desorption  process  is  conducted  under
vacuum condition [144]. Fig. 12 indicates schematic diagram of PVSA
for  DAC.  As  shown  in  Fig.  12a,  the  working  process  consists  of  pres-
surization,  adsorption,  depressurization,  evacuation  and  purge  steps
[145]. For thermal cycle in Fig. 12b, pressurization (1–2), adsorption
(2–3) and depressurization (3–4–5) steps in PVSA are similar to those of
PSA. Details of other two steps are illustrated: Evacuation (5–6, EVA):
Pressure in reactor is decreased by a vacuum pump and CO2 is constantly
desorbed owing to the reduced partial pressure. Purge step (6–1): This
step  is  conducive  to  obtain  additional  CO2  removal  from  adsorption

reactor by feed gas, in which CO2 adsorption is assumed not to happen.
The next adsorption thermal cycle will start when initial state is reached
again.

PSA and VSA experiments have not been widely studied under lab-
oratory DAC conditions. Performance of PSA in DAC conditions has been
investigated  by  temperature-dependant  modelling  [146].  Equilibrium
working  capacity  (EWC)  of  polymeric  adsorbents  was  studied  under
dilute air condition (CO2  partial pressure up to 5 mbar). Results show
(cid:0) 6 bar is required when producing EWC
that regeneration pressure of 10
(cid:0) 1.  If  1  mbar  vacuum  is  applied  and  feed  gas  is  pres-
of  0.49  mmol⋅g
(cid:0) 1
surized to 12.5 bar (5 mbar CO2 partial pressure), only 0.23 mmol⋅g
EWC is obtained. It is found that PSA may not be viable in DAC, which
need further investigation.

Temperature swing adsorption (TSA): CO2  adsorption and desorp-
tion for TSA cyclically take place by controlling operating temperature.
Adsorption  in  DAC  process  occurs  at  ambient  temperature,  while
desorption requires a higher temperature which is related to the prop-
erties  of  adsorbents.  Schematic  diagram  of  a  4-step  TSA  in  terms  of
working process and thermal cycle are shown in Fig. 13 [147]. Details of
each step are described as follows. Adsorption (1–2): Ambient air flows
into adsorption reactor and CO2  is absorbed. Simultaneously, heat ex-
change jacket is continuously circulated with cool medium to take away
adsorption  heat.  Preheating  (2–3):  Adsorption  reactor  begins  to  be
preheated  to  a  medium  temperature.  Desorption  (3–4):  Adsorption
reactor  continues  to  be  heated  to  a  higher  temperature  level  for
desorption process. Desorption occurs when CO2 adsorption capacity is

higher than the maximum value at a constant pressure when tempera-
ture keep increasing [147]. The desorbed CO2 is concentrated by purge
gas  and  leaves  the  reactor.  Precooling  (4–1):  When  adsorbent  is
completely regenerated, the heat in adsorption reactor is removed by
circulating  cooling  medium.  Both  temperature  and  pressure  of  the
reactor decease to initial state. Then the reactor is ready for next TSA
cycle.

A number of DAC studies by using TSA have been investigated based
on different adsorbents [74,83,88,94,148,149]. To reduce external en-
ergy required for DAC, temperature driving forces sourced from diurnal
heating and cooling were introduced to TSA [148]. Compared to pure
diurnal  temperature  swing,  low  pressure  steam  could  improve  TSA
performance  especially  in  the  location  with  the  lowest  average  daily
temperature. The overall second law efficiency of this process is 7.4%,
which is improved by 11% by using a better contactor configuration.
Effects of three typical inlet CO2  concentrations, i.e., atmosphere (400
ppm CO2), gas turbine exhaust gas (4 vol% CO2), and solid fuel com-
bustion gas (10 vol% CO2) were investigated and compared in terms of
total energy demand of TSA [149]. Overall energy demand of TSA used
for DAC is 10 times higher than that for power station exhaust gases. The
relatively low exergy efficiency of a four-step TSA cycle for DAC may be
improved by using internal heat recovery and mass recovery [147,150].
TSA is the mainstream working method of adsorption process for DAC.
Electric  swing  adsorption  (ESA):  ESA  is  an  extension  of  TSA  and
adsorbents are directly heated by electric current [151,152]. To accel-
erate TSA process, regeneration heat of ESA is electrically produced by
an electric current passing through a conductor that can be adsorbents
or other ancillary conductors in which Joule effect is adopted. ESA offers
some  unique  advantages  including  high  heating  efficiency,  fast  heat
rates,  and  high  system  compactness  [153].  Its  drawback  lies  in  low
thermal efficiency which is around 20–25% of TSA and PSA [154]. Only
a few ESA researches for carbon capture are found in terms of adsorbents
and thermal performance. AC fibre materials were utilized as adsorbents
for ESA cycle [155]. This reveals that more attention should be paid to
identify the optimal fabrication condition for CO2  adsorption. A novel
composite adsorbent combining AC and zeolite NaUSY was synthesized
for  ESA application. The optimal  ratio of  two components  was  deter-
mined as 7:3 [156]. Gas separation process is usually inhibited by the
induced  adsorptive  thermal  effects,  thus  high  thermal  conductive  ad-
sorbents need to be developed [157]. The highest thermal conductivity
of a monolithic composite of AC and expanded graphite could reach 30
(cid:0) 1. Adsorbent has an decisive impact on ESA, mostly related to
W⋅m
electrical properties of the material [153]. An et al. [155] and Ribeiro
et al. [153] reviewed existent literature of ESA cycle. They pointed that
evaluation  of  energy  efficiency  for  ESA  cycle  is  one  of  key  future
research direction.

Hybrid processes: System performance of carbon capture from flue
gas can be enhanced by combining various adsorption processes [158].
Analogically,  hybrid  processes  can  also  improve  DAC  performance.
Hybrid processes aim to simultaneously change temperature and pres-

(PTSA)

Fig. 14 shows a schematic diagram of PTSA and VTSA process for
CO2 capture. For PTSA, the first three steps are the same as those of PSA,
which indicates similar adsorption capacities [140]. The rest two stages
are replaced by heating and cooling steps from TSA cycle and described
as follows. Heating (5–6): CO2 is desorbed and removed by heating until
temperature achieves desorption temperature Tde. The amount of des-
orbed CO2  can be evaluated as qin  (cid:0) qmin  according to the increasing
temperature. Purge gas could be applied to carry out desorbed CO2 out
of the reactor. Cooling (6–1): The reactor is cooled to ambient temper-
ature by an infinite cold source whose temperature equals to ambient
temperature.  Because  there  is  no  CO2  flow  into  the  reactor,  capture
capacity remains as a constant. Thus, point 6 is simplified to point 1 on
the isotherm.

It is essential to select an appropriate process that fulfils the excellent
performance  needed  for  DAC  application  [161].  Table  4  compares
different  adsorption  processes  and  their  suitable  applications.  Hypo-
thetical separation systems using a feed stream with variable concen-
trations of adsorbate under ambient condition (298 K and 1 bar) were
investigated for TSA and PSA [162]. Results indicate that PSA separation
efficiency  is  almost  linear  with  the  studied  feed  concentration  and  is
more efficient for bulk gas separations with 10–20 vol.% CO2  concen-
tration. TSA system is proposed to be applied in DAC due to the rela-
tively  high
thermodynamically  efficiency  under  dilute  CO2
concentration. PSA or VSA is beneficial for large-scale flue gas capture
which  has  shorter  cycle  times  than  TSA  because  TSA  needs  longer
heating  and  cooling  times  [163].  Compared  with  TSA,  VTSA  is  more
suitable in the applications that require almost pure CO2, e.g., synthesis
processes where raw gas has high purity [146,159,164]. Besides, com-
bination of TSA and VSA reduces regeneration temperature and vacuum
pressure.  Relatively  low  regeneration  temperature  could  prevent
degradation,  reduce  energy  demand  and  increase  energy  efficiency.
Standard industrial liquid ring vacuum pump could be used for VSA with
moderate vacuum pressure [165].

3.2. Absorption/desorption process

Different  from  active-surface  driven  adsorption  processes,  the  ab-
sorption  capture  process  removes  CO2  from  a  gas  stream  into  liquid
solvents based on principles of physical dissolution or chemical reaction

DAC  adsorption  process  that  needs  intervals  to  switch  different  steps
[168].  In  the  process  of  CO2  captured  from  air  by  using  sodium  hy-
droxide solutions, CO2-rich solvent is subsequently regenerated through
calcium-based thermochemical cycle [125]. CO2 absorption by aqueous
solvents is a mature technique, resulting in lots of commercially avail-
able  technologies.  Carbon  Engineering  demonstration  pilot  plant  has
been developing an aqueous absorption DAC system since 2009 [169],
and  their  processes  comprise  two  chemical  loops  like  Kraft  cycle  as

and is calcined subsequently to release CO2
and CaO which is then hydrated to produce Ca(OH)2. They also provide
the  designs  of  an  air-liquid  high  surface  area  contactor  as  shown  in
Fig. 15 [170] and outdoor prototype [171] for large-scale DAC. Aqueous
systems suffer from complexity of regeneration system and water loss in
dry  working  environments.  A  thermodynamic  loss  analysis  was  pre-
sented based on the liquid-sorbent DAC plant, and the results showed
that  252  MW  are  irreversibly  lost,  which  correspond  to  a  second-law
efficiency of 7.8% [172].

Several methods are developed for CO2  regeneration from rich so-
lutions in chemical absorption processes, including conventional heat-
ing  process,  acid  addition,  addition  of  stripping  carrier  and  newly
membrane technology [173]. BPMED shows great potential due to the
utilization  of  renewable  energy  [123].  Comparison  between  Carbon
Engineering process and BPMED process are described in Table 5. It is
demonstrated that BPMED process can be carried out in a liquid phase,
then liquid and solid phases in calcium-based thermochemical cycle will
not  be  separated.  Schematic  diagram  of  the  wet  scrubbing-BPMED
process is shown in Fig. 16. An anion exchange membrane (AEM) di-
vides BPMED cell into an acid and a basic compartment. CO2  is sepa-
rated from air through wet scrubbing with an aqueous solution of KOH
in  a  cross-flow absorption unit.  Rich solution is  fed  to BPMED  which
would  split  water  in  H
when  an  electric  current  is  passed
through them. Carbonate ions diffuse through AEM to acid compartment
to release CO2, and KOH is regenerated in

[11]. But it is not commonly used in DAC since volatility and toxicity of
some chemical sorbents are incompatible with large-scale application in
open spaces [166,167]. Continuous operation and strong CO2  binding
are two main advantages that promote researches of absorption capture
for DAC. Air contactor for chemical absorption loops, can continuously
operate and can be built by using a cheap cooling tower, which is unlike

Carbon  utilization  to  create  valuable  products  could  result  in  po-
tential economic benefits to reduce net costs of removing CO2 from the
atmosphere [174]. Conventional industrial pathways for CO2 utilization
mainly include enhanced oil recovery (EOR), CO2  conversion to fuels,
chemicals  and  food,  biological  utilization,  and  mineral  carbonation
[175–177]. Most of these methods do not distinguish CO2 sources, e.g.,
from industries or from air. Also worth noting that the utilization of CO2

captured from distributed sources is more challenging than that from
centralized source like industries. Transportation of CO2 captured from
discrete sources are costly and time-consuming, so it is better to promote
in situ CO2 utilization. Therefore, carbon conversion technologies which

require feedstocks with relatively low CO2  concentration are desirable
for utilization of CO2 from DAC. This section mainly focuses on in-situ
CO2  conversion into fuels and chemicals, briefly reviews EOR covered
more  deeply  elsewhere  [178–180],  as  well  as  biological  utilization
technologies. The reviewed CO2 utilization pathways represent the most
beneficial near-term applications for the utilization of CO2 from DAC.

4.1. In-situ CO2  utilization

4.1.1. Fuels

CO2  conversion  to  fuels  has  been  widely  investigated  in  the  past
decades, in which a liquid can be regarded as more efficient or prefer-
able than a gaseous one in most applications. This option would avoid
the transportation of CO2 and could offer a transition from liquid fossil
fuels  (gasoline,  kerosene,  etc.)  to  a  highly  desirable  energy  storage
method [181–183]. Energy required for fuel synthesis could come from
renewables, meanwhile H2 can be easily produced through electrolysis
of water. Storing renewable energy and H2 in the form of chemical fuels

by using CO2 captured from the ambient air is a promising opportunity
to mitigate carbon emissions and solve long-term energy storage prob-
lems [184]. Recent developments on converting CO2 into methanol and
methane are presented as follows.

Methanol: As a basic chemical product, methanol synthesized from
captured CO2  can substitute conventional fossil fuels in various ways.
Methanol can be directly applied as a liquid fuel for internal combustion
engines and direct methanol fuel cells (DMFC). Also it can be a hydrogen
storage medium and a convenient raw material for various chemicals
and products, such as ethylene and propylene [185].

Methanol synthesis can be proceeded via CO2 hydrogenation in the
absence  of  CO  as  in  Eq.  (16)  [186].  The  main  process  comprises  the
formation of CO and water as in Eq. (17) and hydrogenation of CO via
reverse water gas shift reaction (RWGS) as in Eq. (18).

CO2 + 3H2⇌CH3OH + H2O ΔH = (cid:0) 49.4 kJ⋅mol(cid:0) 1

CO2 + H2⇌CO + H2O ΔH = +41.2 kJ⋅mol(cid:0) 1

CO + 2H2⇌CH3OH ΔH = (cid:0) 90.6 kJ⋅mol(cid:0) 1

Methanol was formed for the first time via homogeneous hydroge-
nation of CO2  at 240 °C under 80 bar with the catalytic system which
consisted  of  alkaline  iodides  and  triruthenium  dodecacarbonyl  in  N-
methylpyrrolidone (NMP) solution [187]. Since then, CO2  hydrogena-
tion to methanol by various catalysts and approaches have been exten-
sively  investigated  [188–190].  Currently,  commercial  low-pressure
catalysts generally lie in CuO and ZnO on a carrier of Al2O3 with variable
stabilizing additives and promotors such as Zr, Cr, Mg, rare earth metals
[191,192]. Besides, ruthenium catalyst has been found to be efficient for
DAC under laboratory scale conditions.

Fig. 17 shows a schematic diagram of CO2  capture and in-situ hy-
drogenation  to  methanol  using  an  amine  solution,  in  which  Fig.  17a
indicates  the  reaction  sequence  while  Fig.  17b  presents  the  overall
equation  [185].  CO2  capture  from  air  was  performed  by  blowing

synthetic  air  into  an  aqueous  solution  of  pentaethylenehexamine
(cid:0) 1 for 64 h at ambient temperature.
(PEHA) at a flow rate of 200 mL⋅min
CH3OH  synthesis  was  carried  out  in  organic  solution  formed  by  1,
4-dioxane/H2O  and  triglyme/H2O  mixtures.  Metal  catalysts  for  CO2
hydrogenation to CH3OH were soluble in organic solvents, and amines
were soluble in water, which made easier the separation of the amine
and  catalyst  after  hydrogenation  process  [193].  When  the  reaction
mixture was heated at 155 °C for 40 h with Ru-based catalyst, 2.1 mmol
CH3OH  in  1,4  dioxane  organic  solution  was  obtained  with  a  yield  of
39%.  The amount of produced CH3OH  can be increased to  3.3 mmol
with 61% yield if the solution is replaced by triglyme [189]. Yield of
CH3OH in triglyme is improved to 79% as the heating time increases to
55 h. Continuous production of CH3OH is achieved using this method in
a dynamic system. CH3OH is then separated from the mixture through
distillation.  Schematic  diagram  of  biphasic  2-MTHF/water  CO2  to
methanol system  is presented in Fig. 17c. After carrying  out the con-
version  process  at  145  °C  for  72  h  and  using  2-MTHF  as  an  organic
solvent with 50 μmol catalyst loading, the amount of product CH3OH is
as high as 4.8 mmol with 89% yield. For easier separation of the com-
ponents, amines immobilized onto solid supports was proposed because
amines could be easily separated from the solution by filtration [194].
When employing amine-modified sorbents, the catalysts were success-
fully  recycled  after  several  cycles.  It  was  demonstrated  that  macro-
structure of the sorbent changed after two cycles, resulting in decreased
amount of captured CO2  and produced methanol. System optimization
could  be  achieved  by  enhancing  the  stability  of  solid  amine  and
improving methanol yields.

Amine-based systems suffer from oxidative degradation, toxicity is-
sues and volatilization. An alternative approach to avoid these problems
is the application of alkali hydroxide solutions [117]. The conventional
recycling process of alkali hydroxide leads to high energy penalty. To
avoid that, CO2 hydrogenation with the assistance of alcohols to meth-
anol has been studied [195]. It is indicated that alcohols may trigger
hydrogenation  pathway  from  formate  salt  through  the  formate  ester

intermediate. Ethylene glycol was chosen as the alcohol solvent in the
study and schematic diagram of tandem hydrogenation of captured CO2
in ethylene glycol is shown in Fig. 17d [195]. Hydrogenating captured
CO2  at 140 °C with 0.5 mol% Ru-Macho-BH loading for 10 h achieved
80% CH3OH yield, while glycol mediated Ru-PNP catalytic system was
active  for  CH3OH  synthesis  even  at  lower  temperatures.  To  test  the
system for DAC and CO2  synthesis to CH3OH, indoor air was bubbled
through a solution of 5 mmol KOH in 10 mL ethylene glycol for 48 h and
3.3  mmol  CO2  was  captured  in  the  form  of  carbonate  and  alkyl  car-
bonates. All CO2 was converted to CH3OH when reaction time reached
72 h. Another glycol assisted conversion of CO2  from air to methanol
using Cu-ZnO-Al2O3  catalyst was presented [192]. The amount of CO2
(cid:0) 1  and  89%  for
captured  from  air  and  CH3OH  yield  were  7.0  mmol⋅g
(cid:0) 1  and 97% for KOH solution, respec-
PEHA solution, and 6.6 mmol⋅g
tively. Results show that glycol solvents display a significant increase in
CO2 conversions to methanol.

Methane: Except for conversion to methanol, CO2 methanation is an
another  promising  process  for  carbon  utilization  [196].  Synthetic
methane  is  a  readily  exportable  fuel,  which  is  supported  by  existing
storage,  transport  and  utilization  infrastructures.  Development  of  liq-
uefied  synthetic  methane  (LSM)  greatly  promotes  a  competition  with
liquid hydrogen (LH2) [197]. CO2 hydrogenation to methane over nickel
catalysts was presented more than 100 years ago via Sabatier reaction
(Eq.  (19)).  The  reactant  H2  can  be  generated  from  water  electrolysis
using grid electricity or renewable electricity.

Integration of CO2  capture from ambient air with methane produc-
tion  was  subsequently  proposed  [70].  Composite  K2CO3/γ-Al2O3  was
regarded as a promising sorbent for DAC/methanation (DACM) due to
its unique thermal stability in high-temperature methanation process.
Related experiment was then studied in cyclic mode and its schematic
diagram is presented in Fig. 18 [198]. Composite sorbent was placed

into a cylindrical fixed-bed adsorber, inside which an electrical heater
was located. During adsorption process, indoor air with 380–430 ppm
CO2 was pumped into the adsorber until adsorbent was saturated with
atmospheric  CO2.  Regeneration  process  was  carried  out  in  hydrogen
atmosphere. Then desorbed CO2 and purge H2 were directly introduced
into the preheated catalytic reactor loaded with nickel catalyst (NKM-2
V)  for  methane  production  at  420  °C.  At  the  outlet  of  the  catalytic
reactor,  only  ppm  levels  of  CO2  concentration  were  detected  and  the
peak of methane concentration is about 10 vol.%. Results show that CO2
desorbed  from  the  sorbent  is  converted  to  methane  thoroughly,  with
approximately  99%  conversion  rate.  CO2  conversion  to  methane  is
related to H2/CO2  ratio. For example, compared to a 82%-conversion
rate observed in a mixture of H2 and CO2 (3:1) at 420 °C and 1 bar [199],
an increased ratio in H2/CO2 would make the equilibrium shift towards
products and conversion rate would increase to 99%.

Decreasing reaction temperature is obviously conducive to methane
synthesis process because thermal energy consumption is decreased. Ru
catalyst  is  chosen  to  replace  previous  Ni  catalyst  because  Ru  is  more
active  and  has  mild  reduction  temperature  after  oxidation  in  the  air
[196].  A  process  combining  CO2  capture  and  methanation  was  pre-
sented for DACM. Decreased reaction temperature cannot significantly
influence CO2 desorption amount. Activation of Ru-catalyst in reductive
atmosphere and its effect on CO2  conversion to methane were investi-
gated  in continuous  DACM cycles [200]. Surface ratio  Ru/Al2O3  esti-
mated  by  means  of  X-ray  photoelectron  spectroscopy  (XPS)  revealed
that  Ru  particles  were  sintered  or  capsulated/incorporated  into  the
support, leading to decreased activity. Thus, methanation steps of DACM
experiment need to prevent metal form of Ru component in hydrogen
atmosphere. In addition of catalytic research, thermal modification of
Al2O3  support was also conducted [72]. Optimization of experimental
conditions promoted CO2 conversion to methane with a yield of 98% at
(cid:0) 1  H2  flow  rate.  Thermally  modified
350  °C  and  100  mL⋅min
K2CO3/Al2O3 composite sorbents efficiently reduced regeneration tem-
perature  to  200  °C.  Lower  adsorption  temperature  and  conversion
temperature resulted in the decrease of total energy consumption and a
higher efficiency.

Requirement of in-situ CO2 conversion induces a novel dual function
material (DFM) that captures CO2  from industrial flue gas and synthe-
sizes CO2 under the same conditions [201]. DFM was composed of alkali
adsorbent and catalytic metal nanoparticles that were both dispersed on
porous carrier with high specific surface area. By eliminating tempera-
ture  swing  process  and  reducing  thermal  resistance,  CO2  conversion
using DFM can only use renewable energy in the form of hydrogen. The
experimental study of DFM in a single reactor at the same adsorption
and  methanation  temperature  was  then  reported  [202].  Only  0.5%
addition of Ru catalyst has significantly increased CO2  adsorption ca-
pacity  by  35–50%.  Additionally,  it  is  more  efficient  than  separate
desorption and methanation processes using DFM in cyclic mode. For
hybrid  CO  conversion  with  DAC,  Mesters  et  al.  [203]  described  DAC
process with mineralization of magnesium oxide and its direct metha-
nation. Results show that no CO2 is detected in the presence of excess of
Ni catalyst (90 wt.%), which confirms the feasibility of direct carbonate
reduction  and  methane  formation.  Performance  of  DFM  was  signifi-
cantly  improved  when  ambient  air  is  humidified,  and  adsorption  ca-
pacity was 2.36 times greater than in dry conditions, which indicated a
larger methane production [204].

Polyoxymethylene  dimethyl  ethers  (OME):  OMEs  are  promising
diesel fuels and inhibit the formation of soot during combustion process
of  internal  combustion  engine.  Producing  OME  from  CO2  has  been
analysed  based  on  energy  demand  and  energetic  efficiency  [205].
Despite  multiple  CO2  sources  can  be  supplied  as  the  feedstock  of
chemical  synthesis,  applying CO2  captured  from  air and  indirect  syn-
largest  overall  energy  demand  of  78
thetic  route  shows  the

led to an increasing total energy demand.

In  brief,  integrating  DAC  into  fuel  synthesis  has  shown  a  great

potential  for  a  carbon-neutral  economy.  Synthetic methanol/methane
has  promising  values in  global  efforts to reduce  carbon  footprint and
establish a sustainable cycle of atmospheric CO2. Low-carbon fuels and
renewables can be applied in those traditional energy consuming sce-
narios. A well-developed and cost-effective infrastructure based on DAC
and  fuel  synthesis  is  indispensable  for  reliable  energy  supply  before
complete energy transition from fossil fuels.

4.1.2. Chemicals

Common chemicals synthesized from CO2 mainly include urea, for-
mic  acid,  cyclic  carbonates,  and  salicylic  acid  [175].  However,  few
studies  concern  the  conversion  of  CO2  captured  from  ambient  air  to
chemicals. This section generally illustrates three representative cases of
CO2  conversion  to  chemicals,  i.e.,  formate  salts  [117],  dimethyl  car-
bonate (DMC) [206] and polyoxymethylene dimethyl ethers [205].

Formate salt as an intermediate product in the process of CO2  hy-
drogenation to methanol has been investigated through direct conver-
sion from captured CO2 along with H2 and catalyst [117]. The produced
formate  salt  solutions  are  further  utilized  in  direct  formate  fuel  cell
(DFFC)  to  generate  electricity.  This  CO2  conversion  is  ideal  for  low
concentration CO2  sources, e.g., atmospheric air, but this method has
only been tested under laboratory conditions.

Catalytic performance of CexZr1(cid:0) xO2 has been successfully evaluated
in  the  synthesis  of  diethyl  carbonate  from  ethanol  and  CO2  [207].
Subsequently,  adsorption  performance  of  an
inorganic  sorbent
Ce0.8Zr0.2O2  and its ability to convert CO2  with methanol to DMC was
investigated  [206].  Similar  as  DFM  used  in  CO2  hydrogenation  to
methane, Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 can be applied with a role of both adsorbent and
catalyst. Schematic diagram of CO2 adsorption and continuous conver-
sion to DMC is displayed in Fig. 19. It indicates that higher temperature
would lead to lower sorption capacities but promote CO2 conversion to
DMC.  At  70  °C,  nearly  no  release  of  DMC  is  detected.  By  increasing
temperature to 110 °C, experiments with the highest quantity of meth-
anol up to 33.4% could yield 26.4 μmol DMC (74.9% yield), which well
verifies possibility of CO2 conversion to DMC.

4.2. Enhanced oil recovery (EOR)

Petroleum  field  development  is  usually  accompanied  by  three  re-
covery stages. The tertiary recovery has been widely acknowledged as
EOR [178]. In an EOR process, any material that is not naturally present
in the reservoir is injected into the oil field to displace the remaining oil.
Injection technologies include water injection, chemical injection, gas
injection, and thermal injection, etc. [179]. For depleted oil fields, pure
CO2 is injected to increase oil mobility, volume and reservoir pressure.
The CO2 forces the residual oil to be displaced toward production wells
[180]. Injected CO2 is separated from reservoir fluids on the ground, and
reinjected into the oil to repeat EOR cycle. [178]. When injected CO2 has
a  low  purity,  e.g.,  mixed  with  N2,  gas  mixture  can  accelerate  the  re-
covery process, thereby reducing production costs [208]. But the diluted
CO2  can only recover 80–85% of oil when compared with using pure
CO2. Use of N2-diluted CO2  could be an alternative way that results in
greater viscosity reduction and higher oil swelling under typical injec-
tion pressure.

EOR is currently the second largest CO2 utilisation application with
(cid:0) 1 used, after the production of urea that uses around
(cid:0) 1  [209].  Thus,  EOR  is  one  of  the  most  commercially

advanced  opportunity  for  CO2  utilization.  In  2019,  Oxy  Low  Carbon
Ventures and Carbon Engineering Ltd. launched the world’s largest DAC
and  sequestration  facility  located  at  an  occidental  oil  field  in  the
Permian  Basin  [210].  The  facility  is  designed  to  capture  and  perma-
nently store 500,000 tonnes of CO2 per year for EOR. It is the first project
that combines DAC and geological sequestration on a commercial scale.
This plant is larger than any currently operating application of DAC and
it is planned to be operational by 2023 to continuously provide sufficient
CO2  for  EOR  operation  of  oil  field.  The  final  Front-End  engineering
design is expected to start in 2022 [211].

4.3. Biological utilization

Biological  carbon  utilization  is  an  indirect  carbon  sequestration
method, which relies on CO2  conversion into organic carbon through
photosynthesis  by  living  organisms  using  solar  energy.  It  is  an  envi-
ronmental pathway for CO2 conversion by producing useful biofuels and
value-added by-products [212]. This section discusses the cultivation of
microorganisms,  such  as  microalgae  and  bacteria,  by  using  captured
CO2 from DAC.

4.3.1. Microalgae-based CO2  conversion

Compared to terrestrial plants composed of starchy and lignocellu-
losic  materials,  microalgae  is  regarded  as  promising  alternative  for
biofuel production, which could replace fossil fuels and mitigate GHG
emissions  [213].  Advantages  of  microalgae-based  CO2  conversion  are
summarized  as  follows  [214]:  (1)  high  photosynthetic  efficiency;  (2)
applicable  in  low  concentration  CO2  sequestration;  (3)  faster  seques-
tration  rate;  (4)  less  land  use;  (5)  co-production  of  food,  fuel,  fine
chemicals, etc. Most microalgae cultivation is based on carbon source
from flue gas while growth of microalgae would be inhibited by toxic
compounds,  e.g.,  SOx  [215].  CO2  from  DAC  as  supply  for  microalgae
production  can  effectively  eliminate  effects  of  toxicity  in  gas  and
enhance location flexibility. As a result of in-situ CO2  utilization, com-
plex CO2 transport pipelines and high cost are avoided. Besides, CO2 as a
feedstock in microalgae cultivation occupies purity in the range of 5–35
vol.%, which is lower than most of CO2 utilization ways, e.g., EOR, and
fuel synthesis [208].

Microalgae is normally cultivated in an open or a closed system. In an
open-pond system, carbon sources are supplied through direct CO2  in-
jection or mixture of CO2  and air. Distinctive features for open system
are simple construction, low cost, and easy operation. However, open
ponds  need large  areas, and  often  operate  under unstable  conditions,
which  are  only  limited  to  a  few  algae  strains  [214,216].  Microalgae
cultivation in closed systems called photobioreactors (PBRs) has many
advantages  over  open-pond  systems,  e.g.,  less  pollution,  less  water
evaporation,  higher  cell  concentration  and  better  operation  control.
Different types of photobioreactors used to grow algae include vertical
tubular photobioreactor, flat panel photobioreactors, horizontal tubular
photobioreactor, helical type photobioreactor, stirred tank photoreactor
and hybrid type photobioreactor Singh and Sharma [217]. The simplest
photobioreactor may be flasks with continuous air bubbling.

Optimized CO2 concentration for Desmodesmus sp. microalgae strain
cultivation  was  analysed  based  on  the  CO2  from  DAC  using  amine-
modified  sorbents  [218].  Then  this  concept  was  compared  with  CO2
dosing using fossil fuel derived flue gas. The cultivation was carried out
using  laboratory  glassware  bottles  with  continuous  gas  bubbling

through submerged tube. Regenerated CO2  can be up to 95% concen-
(cid:0) 1 at a temperature
tration with average sorbent capacity of 2.05 mmol⋅g
above 120 °C with Desmodesmus sp. only requires the purity between 1.5
vol.% and 5 vol.%, it is wasteful using CO2  in 95% purity. Growth of
Desmodesmus  sp.  increases  rapidly  by  adding  a  slight  amount  of  CO2
before a decrement of algal concentration is found when 5% CO2  con-
centration is used. The highest algae concentration is achieved at 1.5%
CO2 concentration. Furthermore, effects of different CO2 concentrations
on carbon capture and biomass production were accessed for microalgae
Chlorella  vulgaris  and  Pseudokirchneriella  subcapitata,  cyanobacteria
Synechocystis  salina  and  Microcystis  aeruginosa  [219].  The  cultivation
was continuously fed with an air stream containing atmospheric air and
CO2-enriched  air.  The  microalgae  growth  with  ambient  air  is  slower
than those under CO2-rich conditions, indicating the limitation of low
CO2 intake. Increasing CO2 concentrations to 5% strongly influences the
growth  of  selected  microorganisms,  which  results  in  the  increase  of
specific  growth  rates.  Mathematical  models  were  then  established  to
explain  the  influence  of  CO2  concentration  based  on  specific  growth
rates. Optimal concentrations in air streams for four microorganisms are
5.35%, 4.87%, 5.55% and 5.62%, respectively.

The  optimal  CO2  concentration  for  microalgae  cultivation  in  sup-
plied air depends not only on algae species but also on growth conditions
and  reactor  design.  amongst  various  photobioreactors,  simple  bubble
column and airlift reactor (ALR) with internal and external loop should
be focused. ALR has better mixing, heat and mass transfer than bubble
column  owing  to  the  characteristic  of  draft  tube.  Except  for  essential
effects of CO2 and nutrients in algae growth, hydrodynamic of an ALR is
also an important factor, which is a function of reactor geometry and
operating conditions, e.g., gas and liquid flow rates [220]. An ALR with
internal  sparger  (ILALR)  and  external  sparger  (ELALR)  were  used  to
investigate the effects of high gas superficial velocity on CO2 biofixation
and  microalgae  growth  using  Chlorella  vulgaris  [221,222].  Schematic
diagrams of two airlift reactors are shown in Fig. 20. The separator is
designed to prevent gas bubbles entering downcomer. At a very low gas
superficial velocity, microalgae settling and supply nutrients throughout
the cultivation medium are not sufficient, thus poor mass transfer limits
microalgae growth. Increasing superficial velocity of input gas increases
gas-liquid mass transfer efficiency. Besides, higher gas velocity not only
prevents settling of microalgae but also spreads microalgae in all regions
of  PBRs.  Further  increasing  gas  velocity  would  decrease  contact  time
between CO2  molecules and microalgae cells, thus reducing growth of
microalgae cells. Besides, higher shear stress is harmful to microalgae
cells. Similar conclusion could be obtained by subsequent researches on

external  sparger  [221].  To  understand  the  theory  of  CO2  fixation  in
ILALR and optimize the design, a CFD simulation was conducted for the
mass  transfer  and  CO2  fixation  using  biocatalyst  (adsorption  with
chemical  reaction)  [223].  CFD  results  show  a  great  agreement  with
experimental data with a difference less than 10%. It proves that CFD
modelling could be a powerful tool for complex reaction process in ALR.
Cultivators of algal and cyanobacteria typically inject CO2 to growth
systems  through  sparging  or  bubbling.  However,  with  only  400  ppm
CO2, such method leads to surplus cost and evaporation. Accordingly,
growth media with rich CO2  could be an alternative resolution. To in-
crease  CO2  solubility  in  the  growth  medium,  relatively  high  pH  and
alkali  absorbents  are  essential  to  capture  and  convert  CO2  in  the  air
[224]. Effective CO2  capture also requires a high concentration differ-
ence between the medium and air, thus CO2  concentration in capture
medium  needs  to  be  sufficiently  low.  Reaction  of  CO2,  H2O  and  car-
bonate results in bicarbonate in the medium. Algae actively transports
bicarbonate into cells and releases hydroxide ion, followed by the con-
version of hydroxide ion to CO2. Soda lakes (bicarbonate pool) in which
CO2  was fixed efficiently in the form of high concentration bicarbona-
te/carbonate was simulated for DAC [225]. The increased bicarbonate
and pH in bicarbonate pool are beneficial to microalgae growth. Low
CO2 solubility in water could not supply enough inorganic carbon. When
CO2  is removed from the supplied air, final dry cell weight is signifi-
cantly reduced, which indicates that part of microalgae biomass growth
is  supported  by  CO2  from  air.  Moreover,  maintaining  a  stable  and
appropriate pH by replenishing CO2 is beneficial for microalgae growth.
Microalgae  cultivation  systems  are  currently  required  to  conduct
large-scale testing and outdoor studies in bigger units when compared
with  simulated  gas  mixture  in  experiments.  The  location  of  process,
building integration details and TEA should be taken into consideration
[226,227]. End products of this cultivation process are not microalgae
cells,  but  biofuels  and  bioproducts.  An  ideal  utilization  method  is  to
cultivate microalgae at pilot scale to produce a large amount of biomass
and  then  synthesize  high-value  compounds.  Potential  utilizations  of
bioproducts from microalgae cover pharmaceutical industry, cosmetics
and  personal  care,  food  industry  and  biofuels  [228].  For  example,  in
food industry, pigments and carotenoids from microalgae can be used as
food  additives  as  colourings  and  thickeners  or  used  to  improve  food
quality.

4.3.2. Bacteria-based CO2  conversion

Autotrophic microbial biomass converted from captured CO2 can be
utilized for human food, protein rich feed for livestock and slow-release

fertilizer [229]. These are mainly achieved through the assimilation of
H2-oxidation bacteria (HOB) which use hydrogen as energy source and
CO2 as carbon source to produce carbonaceous compounds and energy
carriers [230]. The electricity driven CO2 fixation process that combines
in-situ  water  splitting  and  specific  microorganisms  is  called  hybrid
biological-inorganic (HBI) systems. It defines a new class of value-added
biosynthetic products and provides novel manufacturing routes for CO2
utilization  [231].  High  content  of  microbial  proteins  (MPs),  valuable
amino acid content and availability for proteolytic enzymes in biomass
of these bacteria are considered as potential protein source for human
and  livestock  [232].  Sillman  et  al.  [233]  evaluated  the  possibility  of
bacterial MP production via DAC. It reveals that MPs production using
air capture and renewables need less land area and water than those of
soybean production. Later, their team presented the integration of DAC
with HBI experimental system [234]. The main parts of HBI system are
bioreactor tank, DAC unit and water electrolyser as shown in Fig. 21.
DAC unit implements VTSA process using amino resin solid adsorbent.
Analysis  for  biomass  demonstrated  heavy  contamination  instead  of
desired HOB biomass, mainly due to inefficient sterilization of the sys-
tem. However, most of produced hydrogen is consumed inferred from
low hydrogen content in the exhaust. It is challenging for system ster-
ilization and the appropriate control of produced hydrogen and oxygen
ratio, which may lead to unfavourable growth conditions of MP.

Based on the above illustration, carbon sequestration through CO2
bioconversion  is  a  natural  mechanism  for  microorganisms,  in  which
microalgae and HOBs are two most widely investigated. Biomass pro-
duction is still in early R&D stage, but has been proven as a promising
method to capture CO2 and minimize GHG effects. It proves that effec-
tive  carbon  sequestration  and  bioconversion  approaches  can  be  ach-
ieved towards environmental sustainability and economic feasibility.

4.4. Future outlook

From  the  perspective  of  CO2  utilization,  DAC  integration  with
renewable energy sources or low-carbon energy sources is promising to
achieve  the  “closing  carbon  loop”  goal  [235,236].  Electricity  storage
over  long  periods  promotes  the  conversion  of  electricity  to  fuels.
Power-to-gas (PtG) and power-to-liquid (PtL) are proposed to be robust
means to temporarily store electricity. There should be cases that liquid
hydrogen carriers, e.g., methanol, dimethyl ether (DME), would be the
preferred solutions to store/transport hydrogen and hence neutral CO2
will be essential for such projects. In addition, while electrification and

hydrogen present a huge potential for GHG emission reduction for road
transport, industries such as aviation and shipping will most probably
continue  to  rely  on  liquid  hydrocarbons  in  the  foreseeable  future.
Therefore, production of CO2-based hydrocarbons, also known as elec-
trofuels  (e-fuels),  becomes  important  as  expanded  use  of  biofuels  is
associated with sustainability concerns and challenges in terms of scal-
ability due to limited feedstock availability in many cases [237–239]. In
addition,  use  of  CO2  captured  from  the  air  assures  to  a  great  extent
carbon-neutrality  of  e-fuels  [240].  Their  synthesis  comprises  various
process stages, such as a) energy generation, b) collection and c) con-
version of CO2  to CO (if needed) and dissociation of H2O, and d) fuel
synthesis; each of them can be realized through a variety of technolo-
gies, as shown in Fig. 22 [240].

Furthermore, e-fuels production processes can be further integrated,
and depending on the DAC technology choice, water and heat integra-
tion between the subsystems could create a more synergistic system. As
an  example,  Climeworks  claims  that  their  DAC  process  is  capable  of
producing 1 kg of ambient water for every kg of CO2  that is captured
[241]. For Fischer-Tropsch (FT) fuels and methane production for every
mol of CO2, 4 mol of H2  are required. By assuming that 1 kg of elec-
trolytic H2 require approximately 10 kg of water, then roughly 1.83 kg of
water is required per 1 kg of CO2 captured which in turn means that the
DAC can provide more than 50% of the required water. Further, the CO2
based refineries typically produce process water which in theory can be
used for electrolysis and further decrease or eliminate the need for fresh
water; it should be noted though that the refinery water would require
more  intensive  purification.  Therefore,  the  DAC  process  can  be  opti-
mized to achieve adequate working capacities for capturing enough CO2
and H2O to meet the electrolyser demands [242]. Fig. 23 describes this
concept, as atmospheric H2O and CO2  are captured, followed by elec-
trolysis (to generate H2, or H2,  and CO, depending on the type of elec-
trolyser), and further synthesis gas upgrading, which creates a closed
carbon  cycle.  The  studies  of  Sch ̈appi  et  al.  [243],  Bos  et  al.  [242],
Marchese [244] and Drechsler et al. [245], for solar fuels, methanol and
methane synthesis, respectively, have evaluated this approach from a
technical, economic, and/or environmental perspective. Besides, atmo-
spheric  CO2  capture  processes  in  which  electrolytic  regeneration  of
absorbent achieves the simultaneous production of H2 and synthesis gas
have been also developed at laboratory scale [246,247]. Similar to water
utilization, energy integration could be applied to these systems, as the
heat released in the synthesis section could be used to regenerate the
sorbent (especially when low temperature DAC technologies are used)

5. Techno-economic and environmental analyses for DAC

Although DAC removes CO2  directly from atmospheric air, its ben-
efits to the environment are partly offset by demands to run the process
and construction materials [248]. Since DAC is an attractive technology,
it is critical to objectively evaluate its technical and economic feasibility
[249,250].  DAC  requires  about  twice  the  theoretical  energy  input  of
conventional  CO2  capture  from  power  plants  as  shown  in  Fig.  24.
Additional energy consumption and cost should be evaluated to decide
whether large-scale application of DAC is worth or not.

Generally,  costs  for  DAC  are  high,  which  are  often  1–2  orders  of
magnitude higher than CO2 trading prices. Thus, reducing the cost is of
great  importance  for  large-scale  applications.  The  cost  to  separate  a
given component from a mixture can be roughly estimated from Sher-
wood plot [251]. The plot consists of a line in the form as shown in Eq.
(20).

[245].

In  summary,  fuel  synthesis  may  be  the  most  promising  utilization
method  in  the  coming  decades.  The  required  raw  materials  can  be
readily  obtained  by  co-extraction  of  CO2  and  H2O  from  ambient  air.
Synthesized fuels from CO2  and renewable energy can utilize existing
infrastructure  and  no  new  technologies  are  required.  CO2  emissions
from vehicles and airplanes driven by these fuels are further recycled via
DAC for continuous production of fuels, thus closing the carbon cycle
and  reducing  the  concentration  of  CO2  in  the  air.  With  appropriate
policy  support,  this  carbon-neutral  fuels  can  play  an  essential  role  in
long-term decarbonization and mitigating global warming.

where  C  is  the  price,  A  is  a  separation  constant,  and  B  is  initial  con-
centration  of  input  stream.  Dahmus  and  Gutowski  [252]  suggested  a
(cid:0) 1, for the separation of pollutants from
value of A equalled to 0.001 $⋅kgi
a mixture of gases. Using Eq. (20) suggests that the cost for air capture is
around  2500  $⋅t(cid:0) 1
CO2 . A Sherwood  plot  only for  mixed acid  gas stream
separation predicts that the cost is consistently larger than 1100 $⋅t(cid:0) 1
CO2 .
It is obvious that cost estimates using a linear equation is not rigorous
enough. Eisaman divided the cost of a DAC plant to three components,
which are expressed as Eq. (21) [253] .

(21)

where the first term represents capital expenditures (CAPEX), the second
and  third  terms  represent  operational  expenditures  (OPEX).  β  is  the
amortized capital cost of captured CO2. ρghQ/Rη is energy consumption
per tonne CO2 with a capture rate R. ρ is fluid density, h is pressure head,
Q is inlet air flow rate, η is the fraction of CO2 captured and g is gravity
acceleration.  Eregen  is  regeneration  energy,  ce  is  cost  of  unit  energy
consumption.

CO2  and whilst for liquid sorbent DAC close to 610 $⋅t(cid:0) 1

In early stage of development, it is difficult to accurately estimate the
cost of DAC technology. Few studies have attempted to assess the eco-
nomic performance of DAC systems, yielding a wide range of results that
are  dependant  on  the  technology  under  consideration  as  well  as  as-
sumptions made. Lackner predicted specific cost of 220 $⋅t(cid:0) 1
CO2  captured
for their first solid sorbent DAC prototype, and could drop down to 30
$⋅t(cid:0) 1
CO2  after further developments [125]. A report by American Physical
Society  (APS)  estimated  the  cost  for  post-combustion  capture  as  80
$⋅t(cid:0) 1
CO2  [119]. Based
on  these  findings,  it  appears  that  DAC  is  less  cost  effective  than
post-combustion capture of CO2. However, later, Azarabadi and Lackner
[254]  found  that  DAC  could  be  a  cheaper  solution  when  natural  gas
combined cycle (NGCC) units cannot be retrofitted for post-combustion
capture, as well as for small natural gas-fired units. DAC can also be used
to  capture  the  residual  emissions  of  retrofitted  NGCC  plants.  When
compared to post-combustion retrofit, DAC will be competitive to cap-
ture  one-third  and  45%  of  emissions  at  prices  of  550  $⋅t(cid:0) 1
CO2 ,  and  100
$⋅t(cid:0) 1

CO2 , respectively.
Regardless  of  the  type  of  technology  chosen,  DAC  units  require
thermal and electric energy, which could be a driving vector in the final
cost  of  net  CO2  captured  as  well  as  the  total  carbon  footprint  of  the
process.  McQueen  et  al.  [255]  identified  two  scenarios  to  produce
compressed  CO2  using  DAC
from
geothermal-based electric utilities and steam from nuclear-based power
plants. The base case comprised utilization of steam from natural gas.
Cost of truck transport for captured CO2 was included to evaluate final
net cost, covering all CO2  emissions involved in the process. It is indi-
cated that the cost for replacement of deactivated sorbent accounts for
approximately 80% in CAPEX. At a capture rate of 100 ktonnes CO2 per
year,  total  cost  of  capture  is  223,  205,  and  233  $⋅t(cid:0) 1
CO2  for  base,
geothermal  and  nuclear  cases,  respectively.  Due  to  incorporation  of
low-carbon heat, DAC emission footprint was reduced from 0.65 tonne
CO2  emission per tonne of CO2  captured (t⋅t(cid:0) 1
CO2 ) for base case to 0.29
t⋅t(cid:0) 1
CO2  for  geothermal  and  nuclear  configurations.  Simon  et  al.  [256]
described  a  generalized  DAC  system,  and  it  consisted  of  air  capture,
water treatment, carbon sequestration and electricity generation parts.
They considered four kinds of electricity generation equipment: wind,
enhanced geothermal, NGCC and NGCC with carbon capture. The lev-
elized cost of capture using wind showed the least value of 293.04 $⋅t(cid:0) 1
CO2 ,
while NGCC system showed the largest cost of 863 $⋅t(cid:0) 1
CO2 . Fasihi con-
ducted TEA on a state-of-art for DAC technologies which are categorized
as high temperature aqueous solutions (HT-DAC) and low temperature
solid  sorbent  (LT-DAC)  systems  [257].  CAPEX  of  two  representative
technologies  were  estimated  based  on  learning  curve  approach  and

technology:  waste  heat

summarized in Fig. 25. It is concluded that LT-DAC systems are more
favourable  owing  to  lower  regeneration  energy  requirement  and
possible integration with low-grade heat supply. Erans et al. [22]. also
summarized TEA of HT-DAC and LT-DAC in more detail. It demonstrates
that HT-DAC designs still rely on the use of fossil fuels for the regener-
ation  process.  For  most  of  optimal  cases,  the  long-term  cost  of  CO2
removal ranges 43–95 $⋅t(cid:0) 1
CO2 . But this value could be increased up to 863
$⋅t(cid:0) 1

CO2  under different scenarios.
While  technology  developers  may  have  the  most  up-to-date  infor-
mation, their economic assessments may be overly optimistic. Similarly,
the assumptions used in modelling studies could be incorrect. As a result,
both  approaches  may  result  in  underestimation  or  overestimation  of
captured CO2  from the air. In this regard, it is also critical to consider
technical experts’ opinions on the future costs of DAC. Unlike previous
studies, Shayegh et al. [258] collected economic and technical data es-
timations  from a  variety  of  academia, industry,  and  policy  experts in
order  to  gain  a  better  understanding  of  current  or  prospective  com-
mercial DAC technologies. This assessment concludes that, despite the
high degree of uncertainty surrounding current CO2  removal costs es-
timates, there was strong agreement amongst experts that, regardless of
technology,  costs  will  fall  significantly  from  their  current  levels
CO2  removed) but will still be significant (roughly 200 $⋅t(cid:0) 1
(500–600 $⋅t(cid:0) 1
CO2
removed in 2050). The second conclusion emphasises the possibility of
deploying DAC systems. Even the most upbeat specialists are hesitant to
provide median estimates of annual installed capacity of more than a
few Gt CO2. Furthermore, the main barriers to the implementation of
DAC projects are technological and policy-related.

Except for laboratory or real demonstration plants, recently, several
models developed for the detailed simulation of DAC are also used to
evaluate energy and cost requirements. Sinha et al. [259,260] developed
a series of numerical models to simulate DAC process of steam-assisted
TVSA  cycles,  and  from  their  results  it  could  be  determined  that  the
choice of solid sorbent as well as the system design impact the economic,
and energy performance of the system. Electricity and thermal energy
are converted to primary combustion energy by scale-up factors. Results
show  that  the  minimum  primary  combustion  energy  for  MIL-101
(Cr)-PEI-800  and  mmen-Mg2  (dobpdc)  are  3.91  GJ⋅t(cid:0) 1
CO2  and  2.95
GJ⋅t(cid:0) 1
CO2 ,
respectively. The lower the contactor to adsorbent ratio is, the lower the
thermal  and  electrical  energy  requirements  become,  while  the  cost
initially decreases up to a certain limit, after which it begins to rise. This
is mainly due to tradeoff between CO2 captured amount and adsorbent
capital  cost.  The  costs  and  energy  demand  are  86–221  $⋅t(cid:0) 1
CO2 ,  and

CO2 , while the concerning costs are 75–140 $⋅t(cid:0) 1

CO2  and 60–190 $⋅t(cid:0) 1

Also,  capital  cost  of  adsorbent  accounts  for  most  of  total  cost  when
using MOFs. Unlike Sinha et al. [259,260], Krekel et al. [261] preferred
to estimate DAC energy requirements using a thermodynamic analysis
rather than detailed system modelling. They also developed a model for
economic  analysis  of  a  DAC  plant,  in  which  production  costs  were
divided into three categories: investment costs, manufacturing costs and
material  costs.  Investment  costs  mainly  include  the  component  and
acquisition  costs  of  adsorber,  desorber  and  other  equipment.  Total
electric energy demand of this system is calculated as 3.65 GJ⋅t(cid:0) 1
CO2 , in
which two compressors, which compensate pressure losses from air and
CO2, contributed the most. Specific production costs are 792 $⋅t(cid:0) 1
CO2  when
(cid:0) 1. A more detailed mathematical
plant productivity is 14,150 tCO2⋅year
model was presented by Sabatino et al. [262], who analysed sorption
DAC technologies, such as alkali scrubbing, amine scrubbing and solid
sorbents  process  (VTSA),  through  modelling  by  employing  advanced
rate-based process models and multi-objective process optimization to
derive an optimal unit design. Mathematical models for solid sorbents
consider co-adsorption of water, an issue that had been disregarded in
previous  works.  It  reveals  that  the  most  efficient  technology  is  solid
(cid:0) 1
sorbents due to their low exergy demand of 1.4–3.7 MJ⋅kg
CO2  and high

(cid:0) 1  and 1.1 kgCO2⋅m
range between 0.2 kgCO2⋅m
indicate  that  DAC  technology  based  on  solid  sorbents  is  the  most
promising amongst those analysed, however, its CAPEX has the greatest
share in specific CO2 cost for all technologies that can be operated below
200 $⋅t(cid:0) 1
CO2 . Furthermore, for solid sorbents, the sorbent cost has huge
impact  in  the  DAC  total  cost,  and  therefore  optimization  strategies
focussed on it could highly help with cost reduction. Due to this reason,
the  development  of  new  DAC  sorbents  is  a  growing  area  of  research
aimed at lowering the cost of DAC. Every year, cutting-edge sorbents
with  enhanced  capture  and  regeneration  properties  are  developed  in
research  facilities but without accurate cost estimates for commercial
levels. In this sense, Azarabadi and Lackner [32] developed a generic
techno-economic model to value any sorbent based on CO2 market price
and sorbent characteristics: cycle time, loading capacity and degrada-
tion rate. The model could estimate the value of a sorbent with known
characteristics and could be compared to the production and commer-
cialization of this sorbent. Conversely, it can also estimate the cost of
CO2 capture using this known sorbent price and characteristics. Results
indicate that a reasonable budget is achieved only when the sorbent lasts
for  tens  even  hundreds  of  thousands  thermal  cycles.  However,  most
sorbents usually do not exceed tens of cycles under laboratory condi-
tions. In addition, experimental energy consumption of DAC is barely
researched. Bajamundi et al. [263] investigated the energy requirement
of a TVSA operation cycle using amine-functionalized sorbent through
experimental  approaches.  After  improvement  tests,  specific  energy
requirement decreased from 4.68 GJ⋅t(cid:0) 1
CO2 , which are in
the range of those predicted models. Share of thermal energy to total
energy  improves  the  performance  from  58  to  76%,  which  allows  the
utilization of cheap low-grade heat.

New  technology  costs  are  subject  to  uncertainty,  and  therefore,
limited studies have thoroughly assessed the likely CAPEX and OPEX of
the different DAC technologies. A comprehensive analysis on design and
engineering cost estimation for a complete DAC system was presented by
Keith and his team [169]. The baseline scenario research is based on an
industrial alkali aqueous absorption DAC system of Carbon Engineering
company, as explained in Section 3.2. Several structure and operation
optimization  of  these  units  were  applied  to  reduce  cost.  They  used
cross-flow  cooling-tower  for  gas-exchange  process,  rather  than  coun-
terflow vertically orientated tower [170]. Use of cyclic-pulsing solution
flow  and  optimal  structure  of  packing  geometry  could  significantly

reduce  pressure  drop  and  pumping  energy  while  maintaining  good
packing wetting and mass transfer performance. Pre-washing and drying
of  pellets  in  the  reactor  avoid  vacuum  filtration  and  reduce  water
carryover,  which  result  in  lower  energy  consumption  in  the  kiln.
Moreover,  pellets  allow  the  use  of  a  circulating  fluidized  bed  (CFB),
which has lower capital cost than a rotary kiln. Calcination of CaCO3
pellets is accomplished in an oxygen-fired CFB, and its conservative heat
integration design reduces technical risks instead of design with higher
efficiency  at  the  expense  of  higher  capital  cost.  A  CFB  design  has
approximately 78% thermal efficiency, which is higher than the 39%
efficiencies of traditional lime mud calciners. Under various plant con-
figurations, levelized cost of CO2 capture range is 94–232 $⋅t(cid:0) 1
CO2  and is
predicted to drop below 60 $⋅t(cid:0) 1
CO2  by 2040 [264]. Using data from this
literature  and  Eisaman’s  model,  OPEX  for  the  regeneration  is  19.28
$⋅t(cid:0) 1
CO2  compared to Carbon
Engineering’s conservative levelized cost.

CO2 , and total cost becomes 29.61–219.61 $⋅t(cid:0) 1

CO2  to  1000  $⋅t(cid:0) 1

The CAPEX and OPEX of the liquid and solid sorbent technologies
were  thoroughly  evaluated  in  a  National  Academies  report  [265].
Because of the uncertainty surrounding some specific parameters and
technological choices, economic and performance results are presented
as  ranges,  spanning  from  best  to  worst  case  scenario.  Results  were
(cid:0) 1  for  the  different  scenarios  of  both
estimated  based  on  1  MtCO2⋅y
technologies.  The  calculated  carbon  capture  costs  for  solid  sorbents
range  from  18  $⋅t(cid:0) 1
CO2 .  Because  these  extreme  values
correspond to the unrealistic best- and worst-case scenarios, three in-
termediate scenarios were also assessed, with CO2  capture costs span-
ning  between  88  $⋅t(cid:0) 1
CO2 .  However,  regardless  of  the
scenario,  the  CAPEX  of  the  adsorbent  dominates  the  final  cost  of  the
solid sorption technology. For the liquid sorbents, the cost of CO2 cap-
ture is equally dominated by the CAPEX and the OPEX, due to the high
energy needs. The optimistic and pessimistic scenarios calculated car-
bon capture prices between 140 $⋅t(cid:0) 1
CO2  to
264 $⋅t(cid:0) 1

In  addition  to  energy  and  cost  estimates,  a  detailed  LCA  is  also
necessary for the feasibility evaluation of DAC technologies [266,267].
Although  LCA  is  a  key  technology  to  achieve  overall  environmental
target, researches on DAC are rarely reported which is often studied and
compared  with  other  related  processes,  e.g.,  post-combustion  capture
and power to gas process.

Giesen et al. [268] was the first to analyse environmental impacts of
humid  swing  DAC  (HS-DAC)  and  results  were  compared  with
post-combustion capture. When HS-DAC is sized to achieve the same net
life cycle GHG emissions as post-combustion capture, more CO2 needs to
be captured. This is mainly because of the higher electricity demand per
amount of CO2  captured. Moreover, HS-DAC requires fresh water not
salty water, and its operation is sensitive to ambient conditions, espe-
cially temperature and humidity. De Jonge et al. [269] initially inves-
tigated life cycle carbon efficiency of a DAC process based on hydroxide
solution as sorbent material. They determined that DAC configurations
result  in  negative  emissions.  However,  negativity  of  these  values  is
subjected to energy supply, which is the largest contributor to carbon
footprint. Besides, Terlouw et al. [270] presented the first comprehen-
sive assessment of life-cycle emissions of solid sorption DAC driven by
low-carbon energy sources. The DAC plant is represented based on Cli-
meworks  technology  (LT-DAC).  It  concludes  that  locations  with
low-carbon grid electricity and with availability of waste heat possess a
great potential for providing significant amounts of negative emissions
as shown in Fig. 26. Also, it is highlighted the importance of calculating
other environmental impacts than Global Warming Potential (GWP) by

demonstrating as an example the trade-off between benefit of achieving
negative  emissions  and  the  increase  of  land  transformation  impact.
Deutz  and  Bardow  [248]  determined  environmental  impacts  of  DAC
technologies  from  four  perspectives.  Their  results  show  that  the  con-
struction of DAC plant and adsorbent production reduce carbon capture
efficiency by 0.6% and 1.2%, respectively, so carbon capture efficiency
would  not  reach  100%  even  when  applied  with  carbon-free  energy.
Synthesis  of  fuels  using  CO2  capture  could  at  best  achieve  carbon
neutrality  when  using  renewable  carbon  feedstock  and  low-carbon
electricity. However, sensitivity analysis shows large uncertainties for
adsorbents,  which  presents  big  challenges  for  researchers’  insights.
Madhu  et  al.  [271]  presented  a  comparative  LCA  of  two  main  DAC
technologies:  DAC  using  TSA  and  high-temperature  aqueous  solution
(HT-Aq). It demonstrates that DAC using TSA surpasses HT-Aq DAC by a
factor of 1.3–10 in all environmental impact categories. HT-Aq DAC is
first  designed  readily  for  commercial-scale  industries  but  has  higher
energy demand requirements.

As previously discussed, the GWP of the energy source has an impact
on the carbon footprint of the DAC system. At the same time, the net
removed cost is influenced by this parameter, since cost reduction can be
achieved through the use of low-carbon energy because of lower carbon
emissions  through  the  whole  process  [255].  This  effect  is  more  pro-
nounced  for  liquid  sorption  DAC  technology  due  to  its  higher  energy
requirements when compared to solid sorbents, according to the find-
ings  published  in  the  National  Academies  report  [265].  As  shown  in
Table 8, when fossil fuels are used for any energy source, the capture
cost is more inflated in the net removed cost than when renewable en-
ergy options are used. As a result, the energy source should be carefully
chosen because it not only affects the system’s final GWP but also has a
significant impact on the capture cost.

The importance of analysing other environmental impacts has been
highlighted previously. DAC systems require significantly less land than
other  carbon  removal  technologies,  while  its  impacts  on  biodiversity
would be considerably smaller because it does not demand agricultural
land. In general, the amount of land required for DAC is determined by
several  parameters,  such  as  the  size  of  the  contactor,  the  spacing  re-
quirements  of  multiple  contactors,  and  the  contactor  configuration
[265], a comparison between different technologies was presented by
Viebahnand is presented in Table 9 [241]. Another important factor to
consider  is  the  amount  of  land  required  for  the  energy  source.  For
example, Terlouw et at. [270] thoroughly analysed land transformation
for DAC systems with different energy sources. They observed that in-
dependent  DACCS  configurations  with  solar  energy  supply  perform
worse on land transformation than grid-connected layouts.

Water loss from DAC processes has so far received minimal attention
in  the  scientific  literature  in  comparison  to  other  parameters  such  as
energy use [265]. According to Carbon Engineering their KOH solution
pilot plant has a net water consumption of 4.7 m3⋅t(cid:0) 1
CO2  and this value
varies  depending  on  temperature,  ambient  conditions,  and  solution
concentration [169]. On the other hand, Climeworks claims 1 m3⋅t(cid:0) 1
CO2  of
water production [272], since it is captured from the air, and this could
be further integrated with a CO2 utilisation process, such as in a water
electrolyser.  Other  environmental  impacts  have  been  also  referred  in
few other studies. De Marchin et al. [273] found that lower CO2 levels
reduced  the  photosystem  II  (PSII)  photochemical  efficiency  in  algae
cultures. In which due to concerns of material scarcity, Deutz et al. [248]
found out that future deployment of DAC system would not be limited by
energy or material requirements.

Another  interesting  area  that  requires  further  investigation  is  the
integration of DAC systems with CO2  utilisation processes, as demon-
strated by Liu et al. [274], and the study presented the first LCA study of
DAC-to-fuel  process.  Two  cases  are  compared  in  this  study:  baseline
scenario  using  oxy-fired  calciner,  and  scenario  using  electric  calciner
case. A full life cycle emission in the baseline scenario is 0.51 t⋅t
CO2
captured from air, larger than the 0.16 t⋅t
CO2 captured for the electric
calciner. Using an electric calciner over an oxy-fired calciner avoided
further use of fossil fuels and resulted in a lower fuel carbon intensity
(CI) per MJ of synthetic fuels combusted. Sensitivity analysis shows that
the  impact  of  the  electricity  CI  is  larger  than  variation  in  any  other
parameter. The lower the electricity CI is, the lower GHG impact of fuels
produced. Kiani et al. [197] conducted a detailed LCA of LSM produc-
tion  from  DAC  and  renewable  H2.  The  results  demonstrate  that  LSM
could  compete  with  liquefied  hydrogen  (LH2)  and  as  attractive
carbon-neutral method to storage renewable energy.

High demand to mediate global warming causes the government to
response for the development and deployment of carbon capture tech-
nologies.  Thus,  quite  few  TEAs  and  LCAs  are  conducted  in  terms  of
various DAC technologies. However, DAC technologies are not mature
enough to possess standard evaluation models based on reasonable en-
ergy and  cost demand in large-scale  applications. It results in a  large
deviation  for  current  TES  studies  when  comparing  various  DAC
methods. Similar situation could happen for LCA researches based on

different ways to process life cycle inventories. Therefore, in order to get
more  reliable  TEAs  and  LCAs  with  results  that  could  approach  real
operating plants, there is the need for guidance documents, such as a
standard, that can limit the variations between assumptions and meth-
odologies used. For example, Sick et al. [275] pointed out the path to
harmonized LCAs and TEAs for CCUS. Key requirements and needs for
further guidance are identified, especially for assessments of early-stage
technologies,  reporting  details,  and  guidance  for  policy  makers  and

nontechnical decision-makers. Also, the Global CO2  Initiative and the
National  Energy  Technology  Laboratory  (NETL)  have  released  pre-
liminary TEAs and LCAs guidance documents to help with the imple-
mentation of these assessments on CCU projects [276]. Similar efforts
are suggested to be implemented in negative emission technologies and
particularly  in  DAC.  Moreover,  the  costly  polices  are  difficult  to  be
imposed on the entrenched interest groups, resulting in a greater need
for negative emissions [277]. Cutting down the cost for DAC requires not

companies  as  well  as  long-term  policies  that  will  derisk  investment
ventures.

Till now, none of DAC technologies has drawn significant attention
in the socio-technical system. This can be solved by either improving the
costs  of  the  existing  DAC  or  developing  more  efficient  technologies
[278]. Besides, specific policy that promotes either DAC utilization or
DACCS  is  needed.  Under  this  scenario,  Caskie  et  al.  [278]  selected
existing policies that are used to tackle climate change through different
DAC initiatives. amongst them, Clean Development Mechanism (CDM),
Contract for Differences (CfD), European Trading System (ETS) and the
US 45Q legislation are considered. These policies are adjusted to support
the  development  of  DACCS  projects.  It  could  be  classified  as  a  CDM
project, but it will compete with other cheaper projects. ETS needs the
offsetting  of emissions  and the creation of a framework that ETS and
DACCS  can  be  incorporated.  Governments  could  procure  DACCS  by
entering into multi-year CfDs with private developers. These contracts
would set a price for one tonne of CO2 removal, then pay developers the
difference between that price and what they can obtain from the market
[279].  The  recent  Inflation  Reduction  Act  of  2022  has  raised  the  tax
credit of the 45Q legislation from 50 $⋅t(cid:0) 1
CO2  to 85 $⋅t(cid:0) 1
CO2  for storage and
from 35 $⋅t(cid:0) 1
CO2  for utilization [280]. For effective legislation,
tax credits have to be increased and DACCS costs will reduce drastically.
In the US, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 has set a tax credit for DAC
of $180 $⋅t(cid:0) 1
CO2  for utilization, and reduced
the DAC facility capacity required to qualify from 100,000 tons to 1000
tons [281]. In Canada, an investment tax credit rate has been set as 60%
for  investment  on  DAC  equipment  for  projects  involving  CO2  storage
geologically or in concrete [282]. Similarly, Meckling et al. [283] sug-
gested that policy implementation for advanced DAC remained difficult
to be achieved due to their high cost and the limited CO2  market de-
mand. Economic studies of DAC estimate a wide cost range starting at
100 up to 1000 $ per tonne of carbon removed. Therefore, they suggest
that setting such high carbon prices seems to be politically unrealistic
[283]. CO2  demand is nowadays mostly associated with EOR and it is
projected to be very limited for CO2  utilization. A key obstacle for the
development and deployment of CO2 removal, e.g., DAC is that existing
carbon pricing mechanisms do not reward negative emissions. In fact,
many experts have already highlighted this issue and proposed solutions
that assume accounting based on storage, rather than emissions [284,
285]. Necessary incentives for DACCS up-scaling should be realized.

CO2  for storage and $130 $⋅t(cid:0) 1

CO2  to 60 $⋅t(cid:0) 1

There have been approximately 19 DAC plants all over the world,
(cid:0) 1  according to IEA
which can capture CO2  by more than 0.1 Mt⋅year
report [286]. In order to promote commercialization of DAC technolo-
gies for further development, numerous countries are specifying series
of policies. For example, US Department of Energy (DOE) has launched
Carbon  Negative  Shot—its  first  major  effort  in  CO2  removal  [287].
Carbon  Negative  Shot  is  the  all-hands-on-deck  call  for  innovation  in
technologies and approaches that will remove CO2 directly from the air
with durably storage or in products, for less than $100 per net metric
tonne of CO2-equivalent. UK Department for Business, Energy and In-
dustrial Strategy (BEIS) has announced a competition with 24 projects
selected  for  Phase  1  of  DAC  and  other  GHG  removal  technologies  in
2021  [288].  Up  to  £100  million  would  be  provided  to  develop  tech-
nologies that enable the removal of GHG from the atmosphere in the UK,
which include DAC technologies. Phase 2 of the competition will take
forward  the  most  promising  designs  from  Phase  1.  The  projects  that
specifically contains DAC technologies are listed in Table 10. It can be
observed that most of these projects implement further conversion of
captured CO2. Additional values of by-products can significantly reduce
total cost of DAC industry chains.

commercial companies are also gathering momentum [289]. According
to WRI 2022, currently, DAC technology is still in the large-scale and
prototype phase, which means that it is not yet ready for full commercial
deployment.  However,  this  also  means  there  is  an  opportunity  to
improve the performance by developing novel sorbents to reduce costs,
which is the objective of this work to know what we have achieved and
what we can do further. Three main DAC companies have pilot plants to
process significant amounts of CO2 from the atmosphere [290–293], i.e.,
Carbon  Engineering  from  Canada,  Climeworks  from  Switzerland  and
Global Thermostat from the U.S. An overview of these three companies
and their existing and planned DAC plants is summarized in Table 11.

to 900 °C, which indicates a large amount of thermal energy demand.
Details of this technology have been discussed in Section 5. Some of the
captured CO2  will be used for oil production in EOR, or converted to
fuels [294]. Nevertheless, the combustion process will inevitably release
lots of CO2 into the atmosphere, which makes this approach not entirely
carbon negative [290]. Moreover, Carbon Engineering is proceeding the
engineering  and  design  of  the  world’s  largest  DAC  and  sequestration
facility. Climeworks adopts adsorption technology for DAC using highly
selective filter materials [295]. Air flows into the collector and CO2  is
captured on the surface of the adsorbent. Then, the collector is closed
and temperature is increased to 80–100 °C to release CO2. Orca plant
which is their pilot plant, utilizes the renewable zero-carbon geothermal
energy from ON Power’s Hellisheiði geothermal power plant in Iceland
[296]. The captured CO2 is injected into the basaltic rock and crystalized
into a mineral that permanently holds it. The current cost is as high as up
CO2  and expected to reduce to 200–300 $⋅t(cid:0) 1
to 1000 $⋅t(cid:0) 1
CO2  in 2030 and
100–200  $⋅t(cid:0) 1
CO2  in  the  middle  of  2030  [297].  Global  Thermostat  uses
customised equipment and proprietary amine-based chemical sorbents
bonded to porous honeycomb ceramic monoliths to selectively remove
CO2 from air [298]. The captured CO2 is then stripped off and collected
using low-temperature steam around 85–100 °C at little or no cost. The
plants are completely modular, which could capture 50,000 tonnes CO2
per year. Global Thermostat produces CO2  at the lowest cost in the in-
dustry, using energy provided by residual heat rather than electricity.
Global thermostat has already built two pilot facilities, each with the
capacity to remove 3000–4000 tnes of CO2  per year [299]. Also, more
start-up  companies  are  developing  novel  DAC  systems.  For  example,
Carbon Collect Ltd has developed a column shaped MechanicalTreesTM,
10 m height, to capture CO2  with sorbent tiles that extend and retract
and arranged in clusters of 12 trees expected to capture 1 tonne CO2 per
day [300].

7. Conclusions and perspectives

From this holistic review, recent progress in sorption DAC with CO2
utilization is  closely examined.  By using favourable  sorbents for DAC
that  combine  working  processes,  capturing  CO2  directly  from  air  can
slow down global warming with a significant amount of CO2 product to
be utilized. Further conversion of captured CO2, TEA and LCA researches
are also summarized. The latest developments and some key remarks are
discussed as follows.

1. The choice of sorbents for DAC always focuses on indicators, e.g.,
adsorption  capacity,  regeneration  energy,  working  temperature,  gas
selectivity,  cost,  thermal  and  chemical  stability,  etc.  Amongst  solid
sorbents, zeolites and amine modified materials are currently proposed
to be the most appropriate candidates for practical DAC applications.
Future  research  on  adsorbents  could  focus  on  CO2  and  H2O  co-
adsorption  mechanism  to  develop  the  next  generation  materials  by
balancing energy penalty, cyclic performance and cost. For large DAC
applications using liquid absorbents, the main barriers of high regen-
eration energy and oxidative degradation need to be overcome. Further
investigation could be focused on water-lean or water-free absorbent for
the improved working performance.

2. After selecting sorption materials, it is essential to determine an
appropriate  working  process  that  fulfils  the  excellent  performance  of
DAC. Compared with PSA or VSA that is beneficial for flue gas carbon
capture, TSA is a good candidate for DAC which can also be integrated
with  renewable  heat  source.  Moreover,  TVSA  is  currently  the  most
suitable  in  applications  that  require  almost  pure  CO2,  e.g.,  synthesis
processes  where  raw  gas  has  high  purity.  Besides,  TVSA  reduces
regeneration  temperature  and  vacuum  pressure  which  could  prevent
degradation, reduce energy demand and increase energy efficiency. For
chemical absorption, the BPMED process is recommended which shows
great potential of working efficiency by integrating renewable energy.

relatively  low  CO2  concentration  are  desirable  for  utilization  of  CO2
captured from DAC. It mainly includes in-situ CO2 conversion into fuels
and  chemicals,  the  cultivation  of  microalgae  and  bacteria.  It  demon-
strates that fuel synthesis may be the most promising utilization method
in the coming decades. The required raw materials can be readily ob-
tained by co-extraction of CO2 and H2O from ambient air. Synthesized
fuels  from  CO2  should  be  integrated  with  renewable  energy  for  low
energy inputs which can utilize existing infrastructure. CO2  emissions
from vehicles and airplanes driven by these fuels are further recycled via
DAC for continuous production of fuels, thus a closed carbon cycle is
formed to reduce CO2 concentration in the air.

CO2 . But this value could be increased up to 863 $⋅t(cid:0) 1

4. Feasibility of DAC has been verified using quite a few TEA studies.
However, DAC technologies are not mature enough to possess standard
evaluation model based on reasonable energy and cost demand in large-
scale applications which inevitably results in a large deviation. For most
of the optimal cases, the long-term cost of CO2  removal ranges 43–95
$⋅t(cid:0) 1
CO2  under different
scenarios.  Similar  situation  happens  to  LCA  researches  based  on
different  approaches  that  deal  with  life  cycle  inventories  and  data
sources.  Current  literature  on  LCA  indicates  that  DAC  could  achieve
lifecycle  carbon  efficiencies  of  85–95%  when  integrated  with  renew-
ables which can be improved up to 800% if compared with that using
fossil  fuel  electricity.  It  is  urgent  for  TEAs  and  LCAs  to  set  standard
guidelines and benchmarks for DAC in the near future.

To conclude, DAC can be a useful tool to mitigate carbon emissions
from distributed carbon sources and is expected to reduce atmospheric
CO2  concentration.  Future  DAC  studies  should  not  only  focus  on
capturing CO2 in the places with low carbon intensity but also with high
CO2  intensity, e.g., office building, hospital, farms in which CO2  con-
centration is usually higher than 500 ppm [150,302,303]. Various re-
sources,  e.g.,  solar,  geothermal  or  condensation  heat  from  air
conditioner could be integrated for the regeneration process of sorbents
[304–306]. This would be attractive to researchers, academics, industry
professionals  and  related  manufactures,  as  well  as  renewable  energy
sector. But sorbents, thermal cycles, working processes, carbon utiliza-
tion and system-scale investigation need to be further explored for its
ultimate  industrialization.  DAC  should  be  treated  not  only  as  a
stand-alone  technology  but  as  a  component  of  a  practical  large-scale
industrial  chain.  The  overall  analyses  and  explorations  for  DAC  are
necessary in an industry that is expected to achieve huge potential. To
promote commercialization of DAC technologies, government policies
prefer to be favourable which could stimulate commercial companies.
