Large eddy simulation 

Swirling flows are of considerable practical importance. They are used for example to increase heat transfer in 
pipes or to stabilize flames at a distance from the injector unit by means of a central reverse flow that establishes 
an  inner  recirculation  zone  of  hot  combustion  products.  The  level  of  swirl  is  governed  by  a  dimensionless 
parameter designated as the swirl number, which essentially quantifies the ratio of the axial component of the 
flow rate of angular momentum to the flow rate of axial momentum. This ratio controls to a great extent the 
structure of the swirling flow and its value determines whether an inner recirculation zone is established and 
whether a precessing vortex core (PVC) is formed in the flow. However, a major difficulty resides in calculating 
the swirl number from experimental measurements and over the last 50 years, several simplified formulas have 
been  proposed to overcome this difficulty. The present study is aimed  at using velocity and pressure profiles 
obtained  by  a  large  eddy  simulation  in  a  generic  configuration  to  examine  these  simplified  expressions  and 
determine the conditions under which they may be applicable. The geometry comprises a cylindrical swirling 
injector,  flush  mounted  in  the  back  plane  of  a  cylindrical  cavity.  Although  the  swirl  number  is  in  principle 
constant when the flow is established in a duct with a constant cross-section, provided that viscous forces at the 
wall  are  negligible,  one  finds  that  this  quantity  varies  substantially  if  inadequate  approximations  are  made. 
Among the many possibilities one concludes that two swirl numbers should be distinguished. The first corre-
sponding to the original definition features conservation properties, but is difficult to properly calculate from 
experimental data. The second is a highly simplified formulation that is commonly used today but does not share 
the conservation properties of the first formulation. Recommended practices are provided on how each of these 
swirl numbers should be calculated. It is also shown that the other formulations yield values that notably differ 
from those provided by the original definition.   

1. Introduction 

Swirling  flows  are  widely  used  in  practice  [1],  whether  to  favor 
mixing [2–5], to increase heat transfer in ducted flows [6,7] or to sta-
bilize flames in combustors [8–16]. These flows can alter their behav-
iour  entirely  as  a  function  of  the  swirl  level.  It  is  known  that  swirl 
notably  impacts  pollutant  emissions,  determines  the  flame  dynamics 
[9–11,17–21]  and  that  processes  like  blow  out  and  flashback  can  be 
controlled  by  suitably  distributing  swirl  [16,22,23].  Multi-swirl  ar-
rangements like the double annular staged combustor (DAC) or the twin 
annular premixing swirler (TAPS) have been designed to control com-
bustion.  Early  investigations  indicated  that  it  was  worth  defining  a 
dimensionless  group  to  classify  swirling  flows  and  determine  critical 

values  corresponding  to  various  flow  regimes.  The  Rossby  number 
defined as the ratio of the mean axial velocity < Ux > to the azimuthal 
flow velocity ΩR 

Ro =

is  commonly  employed  to  analyze  flows  rotating  at  a  rate  Ω  and 
featuring a typical scale R. The vortex breakdown phenomenon taking 
place in such flows is generally characterized in terms of this dimen-
sionless number [24–27]. This is adequate because in the relatively low 
Reynolds number flows that were investigated (Re < 103), a solid body 
rotation could be assumed so that the Rossby number could be easily 
determined. In higher Reynolds number flows like those generated by 
combustor injectors, which are the main focus of the present article, the

Rossby number is less easy to define in a precise manner because the 
flow is non uniform. This was noticed in some early studies on swirling 
injectors and a dimensionless group that had a greater degree of gen-
erality was proposed by Rose [28] and Chigier and his coworkers [8, 
29–31]. The swirl number concept was widely adopted as it essentially 
compares  flow  rates  of  quantities  of  interest  obtained  by  integration 
across an axial cross-section at a position x 

S(x) =

1
R(x)

Gθ(x)
Gx(x)

(2)  

where Gθ  is the time average of the axial component of the flow rate of 
angular momentum integrated over the cross-section, R is a character-
istic radius of the swirling flow and Gx  is the time average of the flow 
rate of axial momentum across the axial cross-section1. Independently of 
these early works, Reynolds [33] showed using a similarity analysis that 
the swirl number is the controlling parameter in the decay of swirling 
wakes and jets. As will be seen later, Gθ  and Gx are conserved in free jets 
and in confined flows if the duct has a constant cross-section and viscous 
losses at the wall are negligible. These conservation properties enhance 
the degree of generality of the dimensionless number defined by Eq.  (2) 

1  As noted by Yajnik and Subbaiah [32], the swirl number is related to the 

Rossby number with the following velocity U*  and rotation rate Ω*  scales: 

Ro =

U*
Ω*R

, Gθ = πρU*Ω*R4, Gx = πρU*2R2

(3)   

and this expression may be used with some confidence to characterize 
rotating  flows.  In  axisymmetric  configurations  these  fluxes  may  be 
written as follows [1,28,29,31]

In the previous expressions U and u respectively designate mean and 
fluctuating velocity components. As Gθ  and Gx  are conserved, at least in 
certain types  of  flows, this is  translated into  a constant  swirl number 
[29],  a  feature  that  is  crucial  for  its  accurate  determination  from 
measured velocity profiles. In practice however, the previously defined 
Gx and Gθ  are replaced by simplified formulations but it is not easy to say 
if this does not reduce the degree of generality that was initially sought 
in defining  the swirl number.  The objective  of the  present work  is to 
compare the various formulations and extract expressions that are most 
representative and are best suited to characterize flows formed by in-
jectors in combustion systems. 

The motivation of this investigation lies on the idea that flows which 
have the same swirl number and the same Reynolds number will also 
have similar dynamics. It is known for example that above a critical swirl 
number,  vortex  breakdown  takes  place  and  a  recirculation  zone  is 
formed  [24–26,34–36].  For  swirled  jets  at  a  high  Reynolds  numbers, 
vortex breakdown is manifested by a bubble-type recirculation region 
located  on  the  axis  of  the  injector  [37]  designated  as  the  Central 
Recirculation Zone (CRZ). In flows inside tubes of constant section it is 

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience89(2022)1009692G. Vignat et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

possible to observe other types of vortex breakdown configurations [1, 
24,25,38],  giving  rise  to  spiral  structures.  The  bubble-type  vortex 
breakdown is often associated with another hydrodynamic instability, 
the Precessing Vortex Core (PVC) which is characterized by one or more 
helical vortex structures rotating around the recirculation zone [1,29, 
25,36,39,40]. When it appears, the PVC extends axially over a distance 
of one to two diameters from the injector outlet. The frequency of PVC 
linearly depends on the injector flow rate [37,41]. When there is only 
one helical structure around the CRZ, this region is no longer perfectly 
axisymmetric. It is deformed by the cyclic passage of the PVC around it 
[26,37]. When a PVC is present, it creates a strong interaction with the 
central recirculation zone. Turbulence is locally augmented and trans-
port is intensified. In combustion, the PVC helps stabilize the flame, by 
accelerating mixing [39,42,43]. It is often found that a PVC is formed 
under non-reactive conditions but that it disappears when the flame is 
established  [40,44,45].  When  a  swirled  flame  burner  exhibits  a  ther-
moacoustic instability,the PVC may vanish during part of the cycle [42] 
and its influence is often reduced [46]. 

It  is  difficult  to  precisely  define  a  swirl  number  that  constitutes  a 
threshold for vortex breakdown. If a value of 0.6 is often cited [37] many 
other values are quoted : 0.48 [47], or 0.45 [48], or 0.94 as in [49]. This 
obviously  depends  on  how  the  swirl  number  is  determined  but  some 
further studies indicate that the flow dynamics depends not only on the 
swirl  number but also  on the initial conditions [47,50]. Escudier and 
Keller  [51]  and  Altgeld  [52]  further  demonstrate  that  the  outlet 
boundary  conditions  influence  the  near-field  dynamics  of  subcritical 
non-reactive swirling flows, a result also observed in reactive conditions 
in  [53,54]. The work  of Weber and  Dugue [16] additionally suggests 
that in reactive flows, the strength of the inner recirculation zone can be 
estimated  based  on  a  swirl  number  accounting  for  the  increase  in 
temperature. 

In  practice,  the  variability  of  these  results  can  be  to  some  extent 
attributed to the different simplified formulations adopted to calculate 
the  swirl  number.  It  is  thus  worth  re-examining  the  simplified  swirl 
number formulations for isothermal flows. An unusual choice is made of 
augmenting the literature review by a validated LES, which is used to 
test and examine the different swirl number formulations, compare the 
corresponding expressions, obtain estimates and analyze their behavior 
as the flow evolves in the axial direction. It is believed that this is more 
complete than a pure literature review would be on its own. 

This article is organized as follows. The next section contains a brief 
review  of  the  different  swirl  number  formulations  derived  from  the 
Reynolds-averaged  Navier-Stokes  equations.  This  section  includes  the 
various combinations that may be deduced from the original definition 
and an expression that is most commonly used in practice that may be 
designated as “conventional”. The computational geometry introduced 
in Section 3 corresponds to a generic experimental configuration that is 
later used to validate the numerical simulations. The numerical set up is 
also briefly described in Section 3. Experimental data are compared to 
the simulation results, and the general structure of the flow is examined 
in Section 4. The various simplified formulations of the swirl number, 
and the axial evolution thereof, are then compared in Section 5. Section 
6 specifically discusses a conventional swirl number formulation that is 
commonly employed in the literature. A few appendices are concerned 
with  various  practical  aspects  and  some  complementary  analysis. 
Appendix A and Appendix B propose recommended procedures that may 
be used in the practical computation of the swirl number from experi-
mental or simulation data. Appendix C is concerned with the compari-
son of the flow and resulting swirl number obtained in a confined and 
unconfined configuration. The jump condition at a sudden expansion is 
discussed in Appendix D. 

2. A brief review of swirl number derivations and corresponding 
expressions 

2.1. Free swirling jets 

Formulations  for  the  swirl  number  depend  on  the  simplifications 
introduced  to  estimate  the  integrated  fluxes  defined  previously.  The 
method  for writing  the swirl number in  terms of velocities and static 
pressure is described in [31] and more recently in [3]. The main steps 
are briefly reviewed to underline the main points in the most common 
simplifications. 

Chigier and Chervinsky [31] employ the integral techniques used in 
shear  flow  theory.  A  similar  process  is  used  in  what  follows.  It  is 
convenient  to  begin  with  the  Navier-Stokes  equations  for  an  axisym-
metric,

The balance for the flow rate of axial momentum Gx  can be obtained by 
first multiplying Eq.  (9) by r and integrating between r = 0 and r = ∞. 
Using Eq.  (6), this yields

The  viscous  term  appearing  in  the  right  hand  side  is  usually 
neglected as swirling flows of interest are generally characterized by a 
high Reynolds number. The pressure at r = ∞, p∞, is included in this 
expression in order for the integral to remain finite. This is specific to 
free swirling jet flows. Equation  (11) then expresses the conservation of 
Gx:

The notation Gf
x,P  is introduced to indicate that Gx  comprises the fluc-
tuating (superscript f) and pressure (subscript P) terms, which are often 
neglected due to the difficulty involved in the determination of pressure 
inside the flow [1,13]. 

A convenient formulation removing the need for pressure measure-
ments is derived in [31]. The Navier-Stokes equations, Eqs.  (6) - (9), are 

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience89(2022)1009693G. Vignat et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

first simplified by considering that in a swirling jet, viscous terms can be 
neglected  and  boundary  layer  assumptions  can be  adopted.  For  more 
details on the use of boundary layer assumptions in shear flows, see for 
example Pope [55]. Equation (7) simplifies into

This last result (17) is used for example by Ribeiro and Whitelaw [5] to 
define a simplified expression of Gx, that can be called G0
x,U,BL, where the

The  simplified  expressions  (18)  and  (19)  account  for  effects  of  static 
pressure within the swirling flow without direct measurements of the 
corresponding term. These expressions however assume a high Reynolds 
number  and  use  an  approximation  of  the  radial  pressure  gradient  in 
terms of the mean azimuthal velocity. 

Consider now the axial component of the flow rate of angular mo-

Equations  (11), (16) and (17) correspond to conservation relations for 
Gx  under various simplifying assumptions and similarly, Eqs.  (22) and 
(23) to conservation relations for Gθ. These results may then be com-
bined in various ways to yield a set of expressions for the swirl number 
defined by Eq.  (2). In the remainder of the paper, the swirl number will 
be notated as Ssuper
sub . The superscript f  is used to indicate that the fluc-
tuating terms uθux and u2
x  are kept, while the superscript 0 indicates that 
they are neglected. The subscript P is used to indicate that the pressure 
term p (cid:0) p∞  is kept, while the subscript 0 indicates that it is neglected, 
and  the  subscript  U, BL  that  p (cid:0) p∞  is  replaced  with  the  velocity 
formulation  introduced  in  Eq.   (19).  The  same  notation  is  used  for 
simplified formulations for the integrated fluxes Gx  and Gθ. 
The most complete formulation for the swirl number Sf

P  takes into 
account both the static pressure term and the velocity fluctuations. The 
reference radius R used in the swirl number definition for free jets (Eq. 
(2)) is the injector radius at its oulet.

Since static pressure and density are difficult to measure inside the flow, 
their variations are often neglected in the expression of the swirl number

To get closer to the original formulation Sf
P, but to avoid measuring the 
static pressure, it is possible to write the conservation of the axial flow 
rate of axial momentum expressed in terms of velocities only (Eq.  (16)). 
Under boundary layer assumptions, the expression of the swirl number 
then takes the form

Here again, the superscript f  indicates that the fluctuations are kept in

Orlü and Alfredsson [3] obtain 
the following expression 

A  new  swirl  number  formulation  is  introduced  in  the  present  article

rely on a boundary layer simplification. It writes

These six formulations use different levels of simplification, and the aim 
of this article is to examine the impact of these simplifications on the 
calculated swirl numbers. It is also natural to add to these formulations 
an expression that will be designated as “conventional”

The reference radius R is taken equal to the injector radius while the 
radial limit of integration Rlim needs to be specified on physical grounds. 
We will see that this may be defined by considering the radial evolutions 
of the flow rates G0

x,0  and G0
θ . 

2.2. Confined flows 

In the previous developments all integrations are carried out from 
0 to ∞, but it is evident that these integrations stop at a place where the 
jet velocity has essentially vanished, or at a radial distance Rc if the flow 
is confined by a duct of radius Rc. 

It  is  thus  logical  to  examine  swirling  flows  confined  in  a  duct  of 
constant radius Rc. A no-slip boundary condition is used at the duct wall 
and Eq.  (10) is then 

and at the wall. Mattingly and Oates [56] derived the following balance 
while neglecting the turbulent fluctuating terms and working under a 
high Reynolds number assumption except at the wall

The axial flow rate of moment of angular momentum is defined as

Ur(x, r = 0) = Ur(r = Rc) = ur(t, x, r = Rc) = 0

The viscous losses in the flow are neglected by most authors. Mattingly 
and  Oates  [56]  however  keep  the  wall  shear  stress  term  R2
r=Rc . 
Equations (24) to (29) can then be adapted to confined flows in ducts 
with a radius Rc  which now constitutes the upper limit of integration.

A  reference  pressure  is  not  strictly  required  but  is  included  to  keep 
formulations  similar  to  those  derived  for  free  swirling  jets  allowing 
direct  comparisons  between  confined  and  unconfined  cases.  Further-
more, the pressure term p (cid:0) pref  then has the same order of magnitude as 
2 + u2
that  of  the  velocity  term  ρ(Ux
),  a  feature  of  practical  interest. 
There is no widespread consensus on the choice of the reference value 
pref . It is often suggested that it may be taken equal to a pressure at the 
wall as this yields relatively simple expressions for the swirl number [16, 
56]. This point will be considered in subsection 5.2. One should note 
that the expression put forward by Weber and Dugu´e [16] contains a 
mistake, which was identified and corrected by Zhao and Weber [57], 
thus recovering the same expression as [56]. The right hand side term in 
Eq.  (33) comprises viscous terms, accounting for dissipation in the flow

One  may  note that many authors  employing Eq. (43) use a  reference 
pressure equal to the pressure at the wall in the axial section where the 
(cid:0) pref )
swirl number is measured, thereby eliminating the term 1
[2,16,58,56]. The reference pressure then varies with the axial position 
in  the  system.  This  assumption  together  with  the  suppression  of  the 
turbulent terms yields a fairly simple expression

2.3. Geometrical formulations 

The previous expressions require measurements of velocity profiles 
that are not always available. They are often replaced by algebraic ex-
pressions based on the injector geometry. The present section focuses on 
expressions suited for the geometry presented in Fig. 1, where a radial 
swirler is placed at the bottom of a cylindrical injection duct. Some as-
sumptions  are  always  placed  on  the  shape  for  the  velocity  profiles, 
which may not necessarily be realistic. One such expression for the swirl 
number of radial swirlers fed by tangential channels only involves the 
swirler outlet diameter Dsw, the radial distance R0  separating the axis of 
each  tangential  channel from  the  injector axis  and  At  the  total  cross- 
section area of these channels [59,60] 

Sgeo,1 =

πDswR0
2At

(46)  

This expression is deduced from expression S0
0 (Eq.  (26)), by considering 
a flat velocity profile for the velocity Ux, that is to say independent of r, 
and by assuming that the azimuthal velocity component Uθ  is constant 
over  the  entire  radius  of  the  injector.  The  latter  hypothesis  may  be 
acceptable with tangential channel holes which are very large, of the 
order of magnitude of the radius of the injector, but not with tangential 
holes having a diameter much smaller than the radius of the injector. In 
[61], this equation was compared with experimental results and it was 
shown to yield values that overestimate results obtained by integrating 
velocity  profiles  and  making  use  of  expression  Sconv.  To  correct  this 

effect, it was suggested [61] that the azimuthal velocity profile could be 
represented by a solid body rotation, with Uθ  depending linearly on r, 
yielding an expression Sgeo,2  that was one half of Sgeo,1 

Sgeo,2 =

πDswR0
4At

(47)  

In  [61],  this  expression  was  found  to  be  in  better  agreement  with 
experimental determinations of the conventional swirl number Sconv. 

Chigier and Chervinsky [31] proposed a simplified expression, based 
on  S0
U,BL  (Eq.   (28)),  which  indirectly  takes  into  account  the  pressure 
correction, via Uθ. For a solid body rotation with a uniform axial velocity 
in the duct, they obtained 

Sgeo,3 =

(1/2)F
1 (cid:0) (1/4)F2

(48)  

where F = (Max Uθ)/(Max Ux) is the ratio between the maximum values 
of Uθ  and Ux  in a section of the flow. 

Another expression derived by Sheen et al. [62] for a radial swirler 
with  variable  pitch  blades  is  particularly  appealing  because  the  swirl 
number is given in terms of volumetric mean values of the azimuthal and 
axial velocities 

Sgeo,4 =

3
4

< Uθ >
< Ux >

(49) 

In  many  cases  the  swirl  number  is  deduced  from  geometrical  pa-
rameters pertaining to the blades that serve to turn the flow, or to the 
injection holes of the tangential flow in the channel [1,12,14]. In the 
case of axial swirlers for example, one uses the velocity imposed by the 
blade  inclination  featuring  an  angle  θ  with  the  injector  axis  and  one 
considers that the axial velocity has a flat profile in the outlet section of 
the  swirler.  Using  these  approximations  in  S0
0  leads  to  the  following 
expression [8]: 

Sgeo,5 =

2
3

1 (cid:0) (Dhub/Dsw)3
1 (cid:0) (Dhub/Dsw)2 tanθ

(50)  

where Dhub and Dsw are the hub and swirler diameters. In the limit case of 
a zero hub diameter, this expression may be compared with that defining 
Sgeo,1. For this one uses the angle of the tangential injected stream in the 
swirler, and by considering that the entry of the fluid into the swirler is 
defined by this angle over the entire perimeter. With these assumptions 
one finds that Sgeo,5  is equal to (2/3)tanθ, while Sgeo,1  becomes equal to 

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience89(2022)1009696G. Vignat et al.

sinθ. For typical angles, of the order of 45
, the corresponding results are 
close.  One  may  note,  however,  that  algebraic  expressions  derived  by 
assuming  a  certain  flow field  yield  swirl  number estimates  that often 
differ from values determined from experimental velocity profiles.

2.4. Limitations in using the various formulations 

This review of the literature on swirl number formulations indicates 
that much effort has been made to define a characteristic dimensionless 
number that will be constant throughout the flow. An important point to 
note  however,  is  that  depending  on  the  formulation,  the  different 
equations  for  the  swirl  number  (Eqs.   (24)  to  (28)  and  (40)  to  (45)) 
require a set of assumptions to ensure the same invariance properties as 
Sf
P (Eq.  (24)). The high Reynolds number hypothesis is widely used, and 
justifies that the viscous terms are neglected. It is quite suitable in the 
case  of  injectors  used  in  combustors.  However,  in  many  practical  in-
jectors, there are reductions or expansions in cross-section. In this case, 
the balance equations (Eqs. (11), (21), (33) and (39)) are no longer valid 
inside  the  injector.  Choi  et  al.  and  Degen`eve  et  al.  [63,64]  present 
models for the evolution of the swirl number in such configurations. 

To  calculate  the  swirl  number  using  integral  expressions,  it  is 
necessary to know the profiles of the different velocity components and 
the static pressure distribution in the flow. In certain formulations (Eqs. 
(25), (26) and (28)), the turbulent fluctuations and/or static pressure are 
eliminated.  Some  studies  [5,49,29,65,66]  have  tried  to  quantify  the 
importance of the neglected terms. Concerning turbulent fluctuations, in 
[5,49]  the  authors  have  shown  experimentally  that  for  high  swirl 
numbers, terms that are usually neglected take significant values. The 
fluctuations  ur,  uθ  and  ux  are  small  but  not  necessarily  negligible 
compared to the average velocities. It is concluded in these two studies 
that the turbulent fluctuations could significantly contribute to the axial 
flow  rates  used  to  compute  the  swirl  number.  The  same  authors  also 

2

investigated the static pressure correction in some peripheral regions of 
the swirled flow, estimated indirectly using Eq.  (15). They found that 
the static pressure correction could be of the same order of magnitude as 
ρ Ux
.  In  [29,65],  direct  measurements  of  the  static  pressure  are  per-
formed using Pitot tubes, and it is shown that the oftentimes neglected 
pressure  term  is  important  to  assure  the  swirl  number  invariance 
property.  Despite  these  previous studies, there  is  still a  need to  get  a 
precise evaluation of these terms. 

Given the experimental difficulties, it is interesting to examine these 
issues  using  numerical  tools.  Because  Large  Eddy  Simulation  (LES) 
methods are considered mature for computing swirling flows, it is timely 
to carry out a study of a turbulent swirling flow and discuss the various 
expressions of the swirl number. This is accomplished by examining a 
generic case in which a swirler is placed in a cylindrical injector con-
nected to a cylindrical chamber. It is thus possible to examine the flow 
inside the injector unit, in the immediate vicinity of its outlet and in the 
chamber.  The  data  obtained  from  calculations  will  be  first  validated 
with Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV) measurements. 

3. Geometry of the generic swirl injector and description of the 
numerical scheme 

The geometry used in this study corresponds to that of the SICCA 
combustor, a single injector system operating at EM2C laboratory. The 
swirling flow can be used to stabilize premixed swirling flames [9,46,67, 
68]. In the present study, all tests are carried out in an isothermal, cold 
flow configuration, only using air at ambient conditions. 

The experimental setup comprises a plenum fed with compressed air 
through a Bronkhorst EL-Flow mass flow controller, with a relative ac-
curacy  better  than  0.75%.  The  plenum  ends  in  a  convergent  section 
leading  to  the  swirler.  The  injector  (Fig.  1)  comprises  a  cylindrical 
channel,  of  diameter  Dsw = 10mm  and  length  Linj = 26mm,  flush 

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience89(2022)1009697G. Vignat et al.

mounted on the backplane of the combustion chamber. At the inlet of 
the swirler, the flow passes through six cylindrical tangential channels of 
internal diameter Dch = 3mm. The axis of the channels is R0  = 3.25mm 
away from the axis of the cylinder, and it is located at xchannel  = 3.5mm 
above the bottom of the swirler. The combustion chamber is formed by a 
quartz tube of inner diameter DQ = 50mm and length LQ  = 200mm. A 
Dantec  2-component  Phase  Doppler  Velocimetry  system  provides  the 
axial, radial and tangential velocity components. 

Application of Eqs.   (46) and (47) yields the following geometrical 

co-flow is added. The mesh is adapted from Philip [73]. The adaptive 
mesh refinement (AMR) method of Daviller et al. [74] is used to refine 
the mesh. Based on the Loss in Kinetic Energy (LIKE) criterion, this AMR 
method is designed to capture the head loss of swirled injection systems 
in LES. It is also found in the present configuration to greatly improve 
the quality of the velocity profiles at the outlet of the injector. A total of 5 
steps of AMR are used for this simulation, the parameters for the AMR, 
defined in [74], are α = 60 and ϵ = 0.7. The final mesh comprises a total 
of 33.55 million tetrahedral elements. The sizes of mesh elements are 
indicated in Fig. 3.

It  is  first  important  to  ensure  that  the  simulation  is  reliable  by 
comparing  velocity  profiles  with  experimental  data  acquired  with  an 
LDV system downstream of the injector. The injector flow is seeded with 
micronic  silicon  oil  droplets.  Profiles  are  determined  at  three  heights 
from  the  injector  outlet,  respectively  0.25Dsw,  0.5Dsw  and  Dsw.  The 
average and RMS velocity are measured every 0.25mm for each of the 
three components. With the cylindrical quartz confinement and its high 
curvature,  LDV  measurements  can  only  by  conducted  up  to  a  radial 
position  of  r = 10mm,  and  are  additionally  very  challenging  for  the 
radial velocity component, which could not be adequately measured for 
radial positions exceeding r = 7mm. 

The same velocity profiles are extracted from the Large Eddy Simu-
lation,  by  time  averaging  over  250ms.  A  sample  is  taken  every  20μs. 
Assuming that the mean flow is axi-symmetric, a further averaging is 
performed by rotation around the axis. Comparison between the LES and 
LDV measurements are shown in Fig. 4, where mean (black) and RMS 
(red) values of the axial, tangential and radial velocities are compared in 
three axial sections. The agreement between the mean LDV velocity data 
and the simulation results is quite good. Concerning the axial velocity

radius by the simulation, rpeak

the  LDV  measurements.  The  peak  velocity  at  x = 0.25Dsw  is  under-
predicted  by  4.7%.  This  small  error  is  still  present  at  x = 0.5Dsw  but 
becomes  vanishingly  small  further  downstream.  The  peak  of  the 
tangential velocity is also predicted 0.45mm closer to the centerline by

shown at three distances from the combustor backplane. From left to right: axial, tangential and radial velocity profiles. Due to the cylindrical geometry of the 
confinement that the LDV laser beams have to cross, measurements are only available up to a radius of 10mm for Ux  and Uθ, and 7mm for Ur. (For interpretation of

the LES, and is overestimated by 6.2% at x = 0.25Dsw. Further down-
stream, the agreement is very good for the mean velocities, although the 
RMS values are underestimated at x = Dsw. The radial velocities are well 
predicted by LES, with only a slight underprediction at the highest axial 
positions. 

4.2. General structure of the flow 

Colormaps illustrating the general structure of the isothermal flow 
(Fig. 5) display the three components of the velocity (Ux, Ur  and Uθ) as 
well  as  the  pressure  (p),  both  inside  the  injection  system  and  in  the 
combustion chamber. Inside the injector, high axial and tangential ve-
locities  are  found  near  the  periphery.  These  two  components  slightly 
decrease inside the injector. A central low pressure area can be found in 
the  core  of  the  flow.  The  simplified  momentum  balance  of  Eq.   (15) 
explains this nicely. The radial component of the velocity is negligible 
inside the injector (see Fig. 5(b)). 

Near the backplane of the combustor, a hollow cone shaped swirling 
jet is formed with a recirculation zone at its center. This is well illus-
trated both in Fig. 5(a) and by the black solid line in Fig. 6, which shows 
the  evolution  of  the  axial  velocity  on  the  combustor  centerline.  The 
recirculating flow is quite strong near the backplane, but starts to decay 

at  x = 8mm.  The present vortex breakdown appears  to belong  to the 
bubble  type  geometry  rather  than  to  the  conical  type  configuration 
identified by Billant et al. [24]. In the conical configuration the cone tip 
would point towards the injector outlet. This is not the case, one ob-
serves however that the bubble is ovoidal and that the upstream part 
widens  rapidly  while  the  downstream  region  closes  more  slowly.  An 
outer recirculation zone is also present near the backplane, underneath 
the jet. Around x = 20mm, the outer layer of the conical jet reaches the 
side wall. This position is marked in Fig. 5 by a red dotted line. At x =
35mm (white dotted line in Fig. 5), the jet has finished impacting the 
wall,  and  the  flow  starts  to  stabilize  in  a  slowly  evolving  state.  The 
pressure mean and wall values in the cylindrical chamber are close to 
patm,  but  still  differ  by  several  pascals  from  each  other  (Fig.  6).  The 
recirculated massflow rate is shown as the red curve in Fig. 6. A strong 
recirculation develops immediately downstream of the injector, and the 
recirculated massflow rate presents a local minimum at x = 16mm. At 
the same position, the wall pressure has a local maximum, indicating the 
location of the vortex breakdown. This feature is reminiscent of the re-
sults published by Sarpkaya [38] who finds a wall pressure evolution 
similar to that of Fig. 6, and relates a local maximum in wall pressure to 
the location of vortex breakdown. In Fig. 5(a) and in Fig. 6, on the axis of 
the injector tube, one can see an elongated zone where the axial velocity

Ux  is weakly negative. This zone delimited by a white line also corre-
sponds  to  a  recirculation,  but  with  a  very  low  flow  rate.  This  region 
created by the impact of the radial jets coming out of the swirler inside 
the injector has no influence on the development of the vortex break-
down at the outlet of the injector. 

4.3. Instantaneous flow field 

The  instantaneous  velocity  and  pressure  fields  within  the  injector 
shown in Fig. 7 present the same overall features as the averaged field of 
Fig. 5. However, they reveal the highly turbulent nature of the flow, and 
the presence of a precessing vortex core (PVC) within the injector at a 
frequency  of  1740Hz.  On  the  path  of  the  PVC  materialized  by  the 
depression zone shifted from the axis (in blue in Fig. 7b), it is possible to 
observe  a  small  zone  of  negative  axial  velocities  (Fig.  7a).  But  this 
recirculation  zone  fluctuates  and  does  not  appear  once  the  data  are 
averaged (Fig. 5a). At the bottom of the injection tube one also see a 
negative velocity zone on the axis. The three recirculation zones: at the 
inlet of the injection tube, in the PVC and at the outlet of the injection 
tube  remain  distinct.  There  are  always  positive  axial  velocity  zones 
between them. The velocity and pressure distributions in the chamber, 
up to the outlet, are shown in Fig. 8. An important flow feature is the 
inner, lower pressure recirculation zone extending from the injector to 
the  outlet  of  the  cylindrical  combustor.  It  thus  possible  to  ignite  a 
swirled burner from the outlet of the combustion tube. The flame then 
propagates from the end of the tube to the outlet of the injector. The 
transverse  cut  in  Fig.  8(c)  shows  that  the  instantaneous  recirculation 
zone is not axisymmetric. This region is precessing at a frequency that is 
much lower than that of the PVC. 

4.4. Axial evolution of flow variables 

Fig. 9 shows the axial evolution of the velocity inside the injector and 
downstream of the dump plane. Four variables are shown: Ux, Uθ, Ur and 
p.  The four  plots  on  the  left  (Fig.  9(a))  show  radial  variations  at  five 
locations inside the injector x = (cid:0) 1.5Dsw, x = (cid:0) Dsw, x  = (cid:0) 0.5Dsw, x 
= (cid:0) 0.1Dsw, and x = 0. Strong variations can be observed: for Ux, the 
first three profiles (x = (cid:0) 1.5⋯ (cid:0) 0.5Dsw) are quite similar, but close to 

the  injector  outlet,  the  inner  stagnation  zone,  precursor  to  the  inner 
recirculation, widens, and the peak value of the axial velocity strongly 
increases near the outer wall. Uθ  features a similar pattern. Close to the 
injector outlet and outside the boundary layer, the flow is nearly in solid 
body  rotation.  At  x = (cid:0) 1.5⋯ (cid:0) 0.5Dsw,  this  solid  body  rotation 
behavior can only be seen up to about half the injector radius, with a 
slow axial decay. As observed in Fig. 5, the radial velocity Ur  is quite 
small in the injector. It slightly increases near the outlet. A strong low 
pressure inner core is present and it rapidly decays near the outlet. 

The four plots on the right in Fig. 9(b) display the same variables in 
six sections on the downstream side of the dump plane: x = 0.1Dsw, x =
0.25Dsw, x = 0.5Dsw, x = Dsw, x = 2Dsw  and x = 8Dsw. Ux  is character-
istic of a hollow cone jet. The radial position of the velocity maximum 
moves outwards and its value decreases as the distance from the dump 
plane increases. The inner recirculation zone intensifies up to x = 0.5Dsw 
before slowly decaying, as shown in Fig. 6. A weak outer recirculation 
zone is also slowly forming near the outer wall. Uθ  similarly decays and 
its peak moves outwards as x increases. At x = 0.1Dsw  and x = 0.25Dsw, 
a strong, outwardly oriented radial velocity is present near the axis, up 
to r = 0.7Dsw, where a strong shear region is established. On the con-
trary, from this point to the outer wall, a recirculation is present, with an 
inwardly oriented velocity component. At x = 0.5Dsw  and x = Dsw, the 
inner  recirculation  zone  weakens,  and  the  radial  velocity  near  the 
centerline becomes small and oriented inwards. The radial velocity is 
strongly  positive  inside  the  jet  and  becomes  negative  in  the  outer 
recirculation zone. At x = 2Dsw, the Ur  velocity profile is much more 
uniform with a small peak corresponding to the spreading jet and it is 
completely flat at x = 8Dsw. The profiles at x = 2Dsw  and x = 8Dsw  are 
quite similar for all four variables under consideration. Looking at the 
mean pressure in Fig. 5(c), or comparing the two bottom plots in Fig. 9, 
the  low  pressure  area  at  the  core  of  the  jet  decays  rapidly  near  the 
injector outlet. At x = 0.1,0.25,0.5Dsw, the pressure profiles reach their 
minimum in the shear layer formed between the inner recirculation zone 
and the jet, away from the centerline. This is probably due to the pre-
cessing  vortex  core.  Pressure  inhomogeneities  quickly  decay  further 
downstream, leading to a nearly flat pressure profile at x = 2Dsw and x =
8Dsw. 

The  previous  calculations  pertain  to  an  injector  equipped  with  a

conclusions would still hold with an axial swirler giving rise to blades 
trailing edge wakes. This study could not be carried out but one may 
note that radial and axial swirlers have similar dynamical features (see 
for example [75]). 

5. The confined flow case 

It is now possible to analyze the various expressions used to deter-
mine  the  swirl  number  and  evaluate  the  simplified  formulations  pre-
sented in Section 2. It is first interesting to examine the quasi-invariance 
of the swirl number in the cylindrical chamber and show that this is only 
assured if the pressure term is accounted for (subsection 5.1). The sec-
ond item to consider is that of the determination of the reference pres-
sure  pref .  For  confined  flows,  the  determination  of  pref 
is  not 
straightforward, a point discussed in subsection 5.2. Since static pres-
sure  measurements  inside  the  flow  are  difficult  it  is  interesting  to 

evaluate alternatives based on velocity measurements (subsection 5.3). 
Fluctuating  velocity  terms  that  are  often  neglected  are  evaluated  in 
subsection  5.4.  The  question  of  the  limits  to  use  for  integration  is 
considered  in  subsection  5.5.  These  results  are  finally  summarized  in 
subsection 5.6 leading to practical conclusions. 

5.1. Axial evolution of the swirl number Sf

P  and viscous losses 

In  this  first  analysis  of  the  evolution  of  the  swirl  number  it  is 
convenient to use a reference pressure that is equal to pref = 101325.3Pa 
in the chamber (x > 0), and pref = 101405Pa in the injector (x < 0). The 
reasoning behind this choice will be discussed in the next Section 5.2. 
One may note that this arbitrary choice of reference pressure does not 
affect the results and reasoning presented in what follows. 

x,P,  Gf

θ  and  Sf

One  may  first  consider  the  axial  flow  rates  and  swirl  number  as 
originally  defined  in  [28]  and  in  [29]  without  any  simplifying  as-
sumptions.  Gf
P  are  defined  in  Eq.   (40)  for  a  confined 
isothermal  configuration.  Their  evolutions  are  shown  in  Fig.  10.  The 
system  comprises  two  cylindrical  tubes  of  different  diameters  (see 
Fig. 2), the radius is constant in the injector (x < 0) and in the chamber 
(0 < x < 200mm) with a sudden expansion between these two at x = 0. 
In this section, the reference radius used for the computation of the swirl 
number  is  taken  as  the  actual  radius  of  the  confinement  at  the  axial 
position  under  consideration:  R = Rc = 5mm  for  x < 0  and  R = Rc =
25mm for 0 < x < 200mm. There is a sizable jump in Gf
x,P, and a very 
small jump in Gf
θ  at the position of sudden expansion (x = 0). The jump 
in Gf
x,P  results from the sudden expansion that induces a net force on the

flow  associated  with  the  pressure  acting  on  the  cylindrical  chamber 
backplane inducing a change in the axial flow of momentum. The small 
jump in the axial component of angular momentum Gf
θ  is probably due 
to  the  angular  moment  of  friction  stresses  acting  on  the  cavity  back-
plane. Inside the injector, the boundary condition is defined by a wall 
law. This yields a finite axial velocity in the immediate vicinity of the 
wall. Immediately after the sudden expansion the normal velocity at the 
backplane must vanish. The singularity of the corner region then causes 
x,P  and  Gf
a  small  drop  in  angular  momentum.  Gf
θ  slowly  decay  in  the 
constant section ducts. Correspondingly Sf
P  also features a jump at x = 0 
and then slowly diminishes in the axial direction reflecting the observed 
reductions in Gf

θ  and that of Gf

x,P. 

At this point it is interesting to discuss the decay observed in the axial 
component  of  the  flow  rate  of  angular  momentum  by  first  reviewing 
studies dealing with turbulent swirling flows decay in tubes. This topic is 
covered  for  example  by  Steenbergen  and  Voskamp  [7]  who  review 
different formulas for this evolution, but give their results in terms of 
swirl angle instead of swirl number. The linearized theory in [76] for 
established  turbulent  swirling  flows  in  long  pipes  indicates  a  typical 
decay of 10 to 20% on a distance of 50 pipe diameters. The decay rate 
increases  at  lower  Reynolds  number.  Scott  and  Bartelt  [77]  note  the 
invariance of the velocity profiles in the axial direction in an experiment 
on  a  annular  duct  with  a  swirling  air  flow.  Kitoh  [78]  provides  an 
experimental assessment of the wall shear stress impact and concludes 
that it governs the decay of the swirling motion which is generally found 
to be exponential. Another relevant feature from these studies is that the 
decay of the axial component of the flow rate of angular momentum Gf
θ 
predominates  over  that  of  the  flow  rate  of  axial  momentum  Gf
x,P,  in 
agreement with the theoretical analysis of Reynolds [33]. 

In this respect it is worth recalling the rates of change balances of Gf
θ 
x,P  established in Section 2, Eqs. (33) and (39). These expressions 
θ  and Gf

and Gf
indicate that the decay rates of Gf
x,P  are governed by the shear 
stresses at the wall. The order of magnitude of these stresses is such that 
θ  is much larger than that of Gf
the decay rate of Gf

x,P. 
It  is  next  interesting  to  examine  the  decay  of  Gf

x,P  in  the 
injector and in the chamber, as well as the friction losses at the wall, 
reported in Table 1. As the literature suggests, it appears that friction 

θ  and  Gf

losses associated with wall stresses determine the slow axial decay of the 
swirl number. 

5.2. Impact of the static pressure on the swirl number and selection of the 
reference pressure 

Let us now evaluate the impact of the pressure term on Gf

x,P. This 
issue was considered in the past by Chigier and Be´er [29] and Mahmud 
et al. [65] who used Pitot tubes to measure velocity and static pressure 
profiles in free swirling jets. It was found in these previous studies, in 
agreement with the theoretical equation Eq.  (11), that the pressure term 
had to be included to ensure the axial conservation of Gf
x,P. This question 
may  now  be  examined  with  the  present  simulation  thus  avoiding 
intrusive pressure measurements. It is interesting to separate Gf

employed  here.  However,  as  observed  in  [65],  these  quantities  take 
different  values  in  the  vicinity  of  the  area  changes.  Near  x = 0,  Gf

features a peak and sizable variations caused by the recirculation region

also  features  a  strong  negative  peak  at  this  position.  The  two  peaks 
compensate each other when the two terms are summed up in Gf
x,P. This 
indicates that the pressure term is of considerable importance close to 
area changes (0 < x < 50mm) to ensure conservation, but that this term 
can  be  omitted  where  the  flow  is  established  ((cid:0) 20 < x < 0mm  and 
50 < x < 175mm).

The  selection  of  a  reference  pressure  is  rarely  considered  in  the 

previous literature but a suitable choice needs to be made because Gf
x,P is 
sensitive to changes in reference pressure with a first order impact on the 
swirl  number  value.  For  the  purpose  of  swirl  number  calculations, 
ρ(〈Ux〉2 +〈ux

swirl  number  to  the  reference  pressure.  In  the  present  configuration, 
ρ(〈Ux〉2 +〈ux
2〉) ≈ 0.5Pa  in  the  confinement  tube.  From  a  practical 
standpoint, Mattingly and Oates [56] propose to use a pressure at the 
wall somewhere in the duct as reference pressure, but with no theoret-
ical justification. One may note that, from Fig. 6, the pressure at the wall 
varies as a function of the axial position x, and that the difference be-
tween the section averaged pressure 〈p〉, and the wall pressure p(r = Rc)
is approximately p(r = Rc) (cid:0) 〈p〉 ≈ 9Pa for x > 40mm, that is one order 
of magnitude larger than ρ(〈Ux〉2 + 〈ux
2〉). The practice of taking the 
reference pressure as a wall pressure without selecting a suitable section 
in  the  flow  is  inadequate,  in  particular  for  flows  with  changes  in 
cross-section. This leads to variable or even sometimes negative swirl 
number  values  [16]  depending  on  the  position  adopted  to  infer  the 
reference pressure. 

The following analysis is dedicated to defining a better practice for 
this  choice.  The  following  properties  are  desirable  for  the  reference 
pressure pref :  

P1  Its definition should be consistent with that used for unconfined 

flows, 

P2 Its value might vary with area changes, but should remain con-
stant in the system elements having a constant cross section,  
P3  Its determination should be straightforward using conventional 

measurement techniques,  
P4  Its value should be such that Gf

area change where the flow is established as illustrated in Fig. 11. 

If it is to have properties [P4], the reference pressure must be defined 

as the sectional average of the static pressure

where  Σ  designates  the  cross-section  where  the  reference  pressure  is 
computed. In this expression, if Σ becomes infinitely large, for example if 
an  unconfined  swirling  jet  is  considered,  the  reference  pressure  will 
simply tend to the pressure at infinity p∞.

The definition of the  reference pressure proposed in Eq.   (54) is thus 
consistent  with  Chigier’s  definition  for  unconfined  swirling  jets  and 
satisfies property [P1]. Property [P2] imposes that this sectional average 
be taken at a single axial location in each part. In the present configu-
ration, the sectional average of static pressure is nearly constant in the 
downstream  part  of  the  duct  after  an  establishment  distance  roughly 
corresponding  to  the  confinement  diameter.  This  property  can  most 

likely be generalized to many constant pressure combustion applications 
featuring constant cross-sections due to the high Reynolds number and 
small length to diameter ratios that are generally found in combustors. 
The reference pressure is thus taken as the mean value of the cross- 
section averaged static pressure at positions ((cid:0) 15 < x < (cid:0) 5mm for the 
injector  and  50 < x < 175mm  for  the  chamber),  that  is  at  least  one 
diameter downstream of area changes and at a distance from an outlet to 
avoid  end  effects.  This  yields  pref ((cid:0) ) = 101405Pa  in  the  cylindrical 
injector and pref (+) = 101325.3Pa in the downstream duct. Figs. 10 and 
11 use the previous reference pressures and show that Gf
θ  evolve 
in  the  axial  direction  in  the  expected  manner  and  that  Gf
collapse where the flow is fully developed.

5.3. Expressing the static pressure in terms of the velocity field and wall 
pressure 

It is not always easy to measure the static pressure inside the flow 
with a sufficient resolution to correctly evaluate the pressure term in Eq. 
(53).  Among  the  methods  that  can  be  used  to  replace  this  by  an 
expression  that  only  uses  velocity  information,  it  is  interesting  to 
examine  that  originally  proposed  by  Chigier  and  Chervinsky  [31]  for 
free swirling jets and extended by Mattingly and Oates [56] for confined 
configurations. This is expressed in Eq.  (35) which, for confined flows, 
still requires a wall pressure measurement p|
r=Rc . It is useful at this point 
to recall that this expression is derived from the simplified Navier-Stokes 
equations with boundary layer assumptions (Eq.   (13)) and that terms 
that depend on the radial velocity may also be included to get a more 
general expression

found in the literature, yields suitable results except between x = 5mm 
and 30mm, where the boundary layer assumptions do not apply. This 
might explain the unexpected swirl number measurements put forward 
by Mattingly and Oates [56]: when measuring the swirl number in a pipe 
downstream  of  a  swirling  injector,  they  found  that  the  swirl  number 
S0
U,BL  was nearly constant, expect in the vicinity of the injector outlet 
where it notably differed from its far-field value. Given the sensitivity of 
the computation of the swirl number to the pressure, it is then preferable 
to use Eq.  (56) in the injector near-field.

5.4. Fluctuating terms 

It  is  now  worth  asking  whether  the  terms  corresponding  to  the 
fluctuating velocities need to be included. It is shown by Toh et al. [49] 
using PIV data that neglecting these terms only induced a 3% error in the 
swirl  number  because  the  errors  in  the  numerator  and  denominator 
compensate each other. It should be noted that these authors did not 
have  access  to  all  the  necessary  components  in  the  Reynolds  stress 
tensor. 

It  is  then  worth  examining  this  issue  by  isolating  the  fluctuating 

terms in the calculation of Gf

angular momentum, the fluctuating term represents up to 25% of Gf
θ. In 
view of their importance in the computation of the swirl number and the 
fact  that  hot  wires  or  laser  velocimetry  give  access  to  fluctuating  ve-
locities it appears advisable to include the corresponding terms in swirl 
number calculations, especially for systems such as combustion injectors 
which operate at high Reynolds numbers. 

The experimental determination of uθux  may be based on cross hot 
wires, two component LDV systems or three component stereo-PIV. The 
standard 2D-PIV cannot be used to determine this cross-correlation. To 
overcome this difficulty with this last technique it is suggested in [49] to 
simply replace uθux  by urux. This possibility is assessed in Fig. 14, which

Depending on the axial position at which the computation is performed, 
two regimes can be found. For x = 2.5, 5 and 10mm, Fig. 9 indicates that 
the flow behaves as a jet with an outer recirculation zone. At x = 20 and 
80mm, the flow is wall-bounded and there is no outer recirculation zone. 
At x = 2.5, 5 and 10mm, the flow rate of axial momentum Gf
x,P is initially 
negative before strongly increasing at the radial position of the jet. It 
then decays again before increasing to its final value near the wall. Gf
θ 
has a similar behavior, with a strong increase at the radial position of the 
jet,  followed  by  a  plateau  and  a  decay  to  its  final  value  in  the  outer 

Finally, we compare in this section the swirl numbers calculated with 
the different formulations. The reference pressures are those determined 
previously in Section 5.2. The reference swirl number Sf
P defined by Rose 
[28] and Chigier et al. [29–31] corresponds to Eq. (40). It includes the 
pressure  and  fluctuation  terms  and  appears  as  a  solid  black  line  in 
Fig. 16. This quantity has the nice feature of being nearly constant in the 
injector and slowly diminishing in the chamber. 

In the second formulation Sf

U  corresponding to Eq. (44) the pressure 
term is replaced by a velocity term and the pressure at the wall. This

reference pressure proposed in the present work, it is close to Sf
P  at axial 
positions that are far away from area changes. It is also close to Sf
P at x  =

differs  from  the  reference  value  Sf

P  when the 
flow in the cavity is established. This happens in the present calculations 
at a distance le  of 50 mm from the backplane that is equal to the cavity 
diameter DQ. It is interesting to ask if it is possible to give a rule for this 
distance. Dimensional arguments indicate that le/DQ = f(Dsw /DQ,Re,S). 
Since the flow is immediately established when the injector diameter is 
equal to the cavity diameter Dsw = DQ  one infers that one may write le  /
DQ = (1 (cid:0) Dsw /D)ϕ(Re, S).  The  function  ϕ  still  depends  on  the  flow 
regime in the injector (through the Reynolds number) and on the swirl 
number. The present calculation indicates that ϕ is of the order of one 
but it is otherwise not possible to give a complete estimate of le  /DQ. 

The fairly common expression S0

U  (where the pressure is replaced in 
terms of the velocity field, velocity fluctuations are neglected and the 
reference pressure is set equal to the wall static pressure) corresponding 
to Eq. (45) is not plotted in Fig. 16 because it becomes negative at some 
axial sections and its value often exceeds the limits set for the y-axis in 
this figure. As previously noted by Weber and Dugu´e [16], this expres-
sion is highly variable near the sudden expansion and becomes negative 
in the downstream section, indicating that the reference pressure is not 
well chosen. Overall, this is not a suitable approximation of the original 
swirl number Sf

P. 

One  may  draw  the  following  conclusions  from  the  analysis  con-

ducted so far:  

• The  swirl  number  Sf

P  is  a  well  defined  quantity  that  has  desirable 

conservation properties in many isothermal configurations.  

• Although it can be easily determined from numerical simulations its 
determination from experimental velocity measurements in practical 
configurations is challenging.  
U  is the most general approximation of Sf
• Sf
P. The simpler expression 
Sf
U,BL  constitutes  a  good  alternative  in  regions  where  the  flow  is 
established.  

• In  confined  flows,  care  should  be  taken  to  properly  define  the 

reference pressure pref . 

6. The conventional swirl number and its estimation 

Given  the  complexity  involved  in  the  accurate  estimation  of  the 

original swirl number Sf
P, it is now interesting to consider the conven-
tional swirl number formulation (Eq. 30) that is widely used in practice 
to  deduce  an  estimate  from  velocity  profiles  measured  as  close  as 

possible to the injector outlet.

In  Eq.  (30)  the  reference  radius  is  that  of  the  injector  outlet  and  the 
integration is stopped at a radial distance Rlim. A critical aspect is the 
suitable choice of this limit. This may be guided by plotting G0
θ  and 
Sconv calculated in the vicinity of the outlet for different integration radii. 
Fig. 17 indicates that these three quantities become independent of the 
integration radius as soon as Rlim > 2Rinj. Although the specific value of 
Rlim = 2Rinj  may depend on the configuration, one may expect that Sconv 
will be independent of the integration radius if Rlim is large enough, since 
the axial velocity component Ux vanishes close to the backplane at large 
radial positions (r≫Rinj). In the section located at x = 2.5mm, one finds 
that Sconv  takes a value of 0.98 that is close to that obtained for Sf
P  near 
the injector outlet on the upstream side: Sf
P

= 1.14. 

It is clear from the elements presented in the previous section that 
Sconv is weakly related to the original definition and that it does not have 
the  same  degree  of  generality  as  Sf
P.  It  is  quite  dependent  on  the 
configuration and on the distance from the backplane at which the ve-
locity profiles are measured. This measurement position should be sys-
tematically specified along with the integration limit Rlim  when Sconv  is 
quoted. However, since Sconv is close to the value of Sf
P inside the injector 
it may serve to classify injectors and in this sense constitutes a useful 
characteristic number and a practical alternative to Sf

One should note that the geometrical formula of [59,60] Sgeo,1 = 1.2 
(Eq. (46)) which is designed for this specific swirler arrangement and 
does  not  rely  upon  an  assumption  of  a  certain  shape  for  the  velocity 
profile, gives a result that is close to Sf
P inside the injector, but also to the 
conventional swirl number Sconv = 0.98.

7. Conclusion 

This  article  provides  an  overview  of  the  hierarchy  of  simplified 
definitions derived in the literature to determine the swirl number in 
practical flows, assesses the shortcomings of the various formulations 
and advises on which definitions to use in practice. This evaluation is 
based  on  a  large  eddy  simulation  of  a  generic  system  comprising  an 
injector  having  a  circular  cross-section,  a  cylindrical  chamber  and  a 
sudden expansion between these two elements. This allows a detailed 
analysis  of  the  various  terms  involved  in  the  definition  of  the  swirl 
number. The analysis is first carried out on the swirl number Sf
P  origi-
nally defined as the ratio of the axial component of flow rate of angular 
momentum Gf
θ  to the axial flow rate of axial momentum Gf
that the axial flow rate of axial momentum Gf
the duct section is constant. The decay of the flow rate of Gf
θ  is controlled 
by the moment of tangential shear stress at the duct wall. The analysis 
indicates  that  the  swirl  number  Sf
P  defined  by  Rose,  Chigier  and  co- 
authors  [28–31]  needs  to  account  for  the  pressure  term  that  is  often 
neglected.  In  practical  confined  flows  this  requires  the  inclusion  of  a 
reference pressure. It is shown that this quantity needs to be adapted to

Sf
U,BL (Eq. (43)) and S0

the  determination  of  the  original  swirl  number  from  experimentally

the complex expression Sf

Calculating Sf

numerical  simulations,  which  have  shown  their  capability  to  model 
swirling  flows,  appear  better  suited  to  the  task  of  determining  the 
original swirl number Sf
P than using formulations that try to approximate 
the  original  expression.  A  highly  simplified  expression  for  a  conven-
tional swirl number Sconv  obtained by eliminating the pressure term and 
the turbulent fluctuation stresses may constitute a practical alternative 
when the swirl number has to be determined from experimental data. 
Although it is only weakly linked to the original definition, and does not 
have  the  same  degree  of  generality,  this  conventional  swirl  number 
provides an estimate of the degree of swirl and may serve to categorize 
injectors.  Appendix  A  and  Appendix  B  contain  a  synthesis  of  recom-

Appendix A. Method to calculate the swirl number from CFD simulations 

Based on the previous analysis it is possible to formulate a set of guidelines for the computation of the swirl number in incompressible isothermal 
flows. These guidelines are suggested to ensure a high level of generality and reproducibility, while keeping the process straightforward in practical 
systems. We here consider cases where the swirl number is determined from CFD simulations and we examine unconfined and confined situations. 
The computation of the conventional swirl number Sconv  (Eq. (30)) is quite straightforward and is discussed in Section A.1. On the other hand, 
P can be challenging and requires well converged statistics. If a compressible solver is used, the presence 
P. For this reason, the authors highly recommend examining the 
P in an unconfined configuration

of even minute spurious pressure oscillations can greatly impact the computation of Sf

A1. Determination of the conventional swirl number Sconv 

The determination of the conventional swirl number Sconv  is quite straightforward. Mean velocity profiles should be acquired at an axial section 

located as close to the outlet of the injector as possible and can be integrated as follow: 

∫ Rlim

The radial integration limit Rlim may be determined by plotting Sconv for different integration radii as shown in Fig. 17. When quoting a value of Sconv, 

the axial section at which it is determined and the integration limit Rlim  should be specified so that the computation is reproducible. 

A2. Determination of Sf

P  in an unconfined configuration 

The calculation may proceed according to the following steps:  

(1)  Choose a reference radius Rref . It is suggested to choose the radius of the outlet port of the injection system.  
(2)  Determine the far-field pressure p∞:  

• In the case of quiescent surroundings, this corresponds to the mean static pressure at infinity p∞ = p(r = ∞).  
• If a low velocity co-flow is present, p∞ = p(r = ∞) + ρ(r = ∞)Ux

2(r = ∞).

calculation. It is recommended to verify this choice by plotting curves similar to those of Fig. 15 to check that most of the flowrate of momentum 
is accounted for3.

Appendix B. Method to calculate the swirl number from experimental data 

We consider in the present appendix cases where the swirl number is determined from experiments and we examine unconfined and confined 
situations. The computation of the conventional swirl number Sconv  (Eq. (30)) is quite straightforward and the reader is referred to Appendix A.1 for 
more details. The direct determination of the more general swirl number Sf
P may only be accomplished using intrusive Pitot tubes. The formulation Sf

(Eqs. (29) and (44)) is better suited and provides a good estimate of Sf
U  are 
presented in Section B.1. In Section B.2, we discuss the challenges associated with the determination of Sf
U in confined configurations, and suggest two 
methods that may be used if the experimental challenges are overcome.

It is assumed that measurements are obtained from laser velocimetry techniques such as Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV) or Particle Image 
Velocimetry (PIV) and that the following time averaged quantities are available: axial velocity Ux and its axial gradient; axial velocity fluctuations ux; 
tangential velocity Uθ; tangential velocity fluctuations uθ; radial velocity Ur  and its axial gradient; radial velocity fluctuations ur; Reynolds stress term

component stereo-PIV, which give access to both Reynold stress terms uxuθ  and uxur. The swirl number may then be determined with the following 
steps.  

(1)  Choose a reference radius Rref . A natural choice is the radius of the outlet port of the injection system.  
(2)  Choose a practical integration limit Rlim. The integration should be stopped where the axial velocity and its fluctuations are close to zero (or u∞

B2. Determination of the swirl number Sf

U  in confined flows 

The determination of the swirl number Sf

U  in confined flows presents two major challenges.  

• As shown in Section 5.5, the integration of the velocity profiles must be conducted up to the wall, the radial position closest to the wall conveying a 
large weight in the final results. This implies that all velocities, including cross-correlations such as uxuθ  or the axial gradient of uxur  must be 
accurately measured near the wall with a sufficiently high resolution. Although possible in some configurations using current laser velocimetry 
apparatus, it remains an arduous task.  

• A reference pressure needs to be determined. 

Given these difficulties, numerical simulations should be considered as a practical alternative if Sf

U are required. We nonetheless present here 
two methods to determine Sf
U  in confined configurations: in the simpler, but more approximate, high Reynolds number method of Section B.2.1, all 
viscous  losses  are  neglected.  Measurements  are  conducted  at  an  axial  section  where  the  flow  is  established,  thereby  removing  the  need  for  the 
determination of the reference pressure. A more complex method which does not involve any simplifying assumptions is given in Section B.2.2. 

P or Sf

B2.1. Simple method: High reynolds number approach 

The method presented in this section applies to confined swirling jets in configuration with a constant cross-section Σ. It is demonstrated in Section 
2,  and  verified in Section  5.1 that,  if viscous dissipation is  negligible, the swirl  number is  conserved in a  cylindrical duct. Similar  conservation 
properties can be demonstrated in the case of non-cylindrical confinements with constant cross-section. It is then natural to attempt to measure the 
swirl number at an axial section where the flow is established, and where many complexities related to the radial expansion of the flow can be 
neglected. In particular, with the definition of the reference pressure put forward in Section 5.2, it becomes unnecessary to determine either the static 
pressure or the reference pressure: 

∫
Σ(p (cid:0) pref )dS = 0. 

The swirl number may then be determined with the following steps.  

(1)  Choose a reference radius Rref . It is suggested to use the radius of the confinement6 

5  In practice, a good point to start is Rlim ≥ 2Rref . If Rlim  is sufficiently large, Gf

θ  and Gf

x,U  are independent of Rlim. Thus, consider plotting graphs similar to Fig. C.20, 

check for the following properties and increase Rlim  until they are satisfied:  

(a)  All velocities and the static pressure at this position should be close to their value at r = ∞

B2.2. Complex method: Injector near-field measurements 

This method requires the velocity field to be measured in at least two axial section thereafter referred to as Σ1 and Σ2. The flow must be established 
at Σ1, which serves to determine the reference pressure. Σ2 may be found in the vicinity of the injection unit or wherever the experimenter sees fit. It is 
assumed here that the cross-section does not vary: Σ1 = Σ2. The difference in wall pressure between these two axial sections ΔP21 = p(r = Rc, x = xΣ2)
(cid:0) p(r = Rc, x = xΣ1) must also be measured using a sensitive differential pressure gauge.

Alternatively to the use of Eq. (B.9), in a configuration similar to that used in the present study (depicted schematically in Fig. D.22, where the 
outlet  of  a  simple  cylindrical  combustor  is  found  in  a  quiescent  atmosphere,  the  use  of  analytical  jump  conditions  such  as  those  presented  in 
Appendix D (Eqs. (D.3) or (D.6)) may be considered to determine a reference pressure and subsequently compute the swirl number using Eq. (44). 

Appendix C. Can swirl numbers measured in a free swirling jet be extended to a confined configuration ? 

In order  to test the proposed  swirl number computation method on a  free swirling jet, it  is here  applied to the same injector and operating 

conditions, but without the quartz confinement tube. The values of Sf
U and Sconv for the free swirling jet are then compared to their counterpart for the 
confined  flow.  We  thus  examine  whether swirl  number measured  in  unconfined  cases (which  are  generally  far  easier  to  investigate in  terms  of 
measurement apparatus) may easily be extended to a confined configuration. 

To this end, LDV measurements are performed at x = 5, 10 and 20mm. As per the LDV system specifications and accounting for statistical un-
(cid:0) 1  for both mean and RMS velocities. The 
certainties (assuming an underlying gaussian distribution), measurement uncertainties are under 0.25ms
relative measurement uncertainty for cross-correlation are better than 40% for r < 15mm, but can reach up to 100% for r > 15mm. Imperfections in 
the seeding are not accounted for. Results are presented in Fig. C.18 and C.19, and compared with the confined velocity profiles from the LES, which 
have been previously thoroughly validated in Fig. 4. In the outer regions, as could be expected, the flow differs significantly between the two con-
figurations, and in particular, the unconfined case does not have an outer recirculation zone. The unconfined jet is also much narrower than its 
confined counterpart, with a weaker and narrower inner recirculation zone. The unconfined jet is not spreading as widely, and the maximum axial 
velocity is found to remain around r ≈ 6mm at z = 5, 10 and 20mm. 

Let us now compute the swirl number Sf

U  (Eq. 29) as recommended per the procedure of Appendix B.1. In the present case, the reference radius is

The derivative of these terms with respect to Rlim is scaled by Rinj and shown alongside (dotted lines in Fig. C.20). Let us first consider z = 10mm (black 
curves). From Fig. C.18, the axial velocity is close to zero after r = 15mm: Ux(z = 10,r > 15) ≈ 0. Fig. C.20(b) shows that, for Rlim > 15mm, Gf

constant and Rinj ∂Gf

the decay of Gf

sections are chosen using the same process: Rlim(z = 5mm) = 15mm and Rlim(z = 20mm) = 25mm. From Fig. C.20, one also observes that the values of 
x,U  and Gf

In Fig. C.21, swirl numbers obtained in the confined case (black) using Eqs.  (40) (Sf

U) and (42) (Sconv) are compared with swirl numbers 
computed in the unconfined case (red, LDV). The swirl number for the free jet, computed using Eq.   (29) (Sf
U) are tightly grouped together as is 
expected from the conservation properties. However, the conventional swirl number Sconv (Eq.  (30)) has a much higher variability. While the values of 
Sconv  are reasonably similar between the confined and unconfined cases at x = 2.5 and 5mm, Sf
U  differs significantly. This could be expected because 
the mean velocity profiles are quite similar close to the outlet of the injector, but become quite different further downstream. This large effect of the 
confinement is coherent with the literature on swirling flow showing examples of such confinement induced changes in near-injector flowfields [51, 
52,79].

From this, one can conclude that swirl numbers (Sf

U) measured 
in unconfined jets. On the other hand, in the present configuration, the values of the conventional swirl number Sconv  are reasonably close provided 
that they are evaluated close to the outlet of the injector.

Appendix D. A jump condition to determine the reference pressure 

x,P  and Gf

It is worth examining the jumps in Gf

θ  at the sudden expansion. In the present appendix, these jumps are used to derive a method for 
determining the jump in reference pressure, which may be used as an alternative to Eq. (B.9). The fate of swirling flows after an area change is 
investigated, for example, in [80], with detailed experimental determination of velocity profiles, and correlations for vortex breakdown regimes and 
precessing vortex core frequency. This configuration is also studied in the vortex breakdown literature [24–27], the usual configuration being a swirl 
flow at a sudden expansion, but in water at a lower upstream Reynolds number. However, the evolution of the swirl number itself is not often 
considered. This matter is briefly discussed in [81] and in [82], and there is also a recent study of the effect of a conical cup fitted to a cylindrical 
injector in [64]. Choi et al. [63] propose a 1D low-order model for the swirl number evolution in injectors featuring an annular cross-section with 
expansion and contraction. However, the pressure term is not accounted for in the swirl number formulation. 

Fig. 10 shows the sizable changes in Gf

θ  only features a relatively small jump. From a straightforward 
application  of  momentum  balance  to  the  control  volume  defined  in  Fig.  D.22,  combined  with  assumptions  that  the  flow  is  incompressible  and 
isothermal, and that viscous effects can be neglected, one may write jump relations between the upstream ( - ) and downstream ( + ) sections:

where  the  right  hand  term  accounts  for  the  pressure  force  on  the  backplane  and  the  change  in  reference  pressure.  Σ|+ and  Σ|(cid:0) designate  the 
downstream and upstream cross-sectional areas respectively. The change in the axial flux of axial momentum can thus be decomposed in two con-
tributions: the change in reference pressure and the force exerted on the backplane. The latter is linked to the singular head loss at the sudden 
expansion. The change in reference pressure may be derived from the jump condition of Gf

x,P, and this process is described in what follows. 

In compliance with property [P2] (Section 5.2), two reference pressures are defined, corresponding to the upstream ((cid:0) ) and downstream (+)
sections. Without any simplifying assumption, the change in reference pressure is linked to the singular head loss ΔPloc  at the sudden expansion by

is close to unity 

Using these relationships a jump condition for the reference pressure is obtained based only on the upstream Boussinesq coefficient M|(cid:0) and well- 
known geometric and operational parameters. Fig. D.23 shows that in the present case, the Boussinesq coefficient M, section averaged total 〈ptot
〉
and static 〈p〉 pressures can be considered to be constant where the flow is established. This is coherent with previous experimental measurements in 
[77,78] where the shape of the velocity profiles is found to be conserved. 

In the present case, the simulation yields ΔPloc = 317Pa, and the Boussinesq coefficients M|(cid:0) = 1.3 and M|+ = 3.2. The estimate for ΔPloc from Eq. 
(D.5) is 318Pa. In Section 5.2, the reference pressures were chosen as pref (+) = 101325.3Pa in the downstream duct and pref ((cid:0) ) = 101405Pa in the 
cylindrical injector, which gives pref ( (cid:0)

) (cid:0) pref ( + ) = 80Pa. Equation (D.3) yields pref ( (cid:0)

) (cid:0) pref ( + ) = 88Pa. 

In practive, Eq. (D.3) may be used to estimate the reference pressure. For example, for a ducted swirling flow exhausting to a quiescent atmosphere, 

the reference pressure in the duct may be readily estimated by recasting Eq. (D.3) and (D.5):
