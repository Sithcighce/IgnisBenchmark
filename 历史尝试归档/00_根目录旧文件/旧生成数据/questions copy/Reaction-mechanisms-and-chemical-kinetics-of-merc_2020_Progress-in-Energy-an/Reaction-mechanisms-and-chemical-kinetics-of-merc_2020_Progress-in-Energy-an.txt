Mercury (Hg) emission from coal combustion has attracted considerable public concern because of its 
harmful effects on human health and the ecosystem. The fundamental understanding of the reaction 
mechanisms and chemical kinetics that govern the transformation of Hg 0 
and Hg p in coal-ﬁred 
ﬂue gas is crucial for mercury emission control. Kinetic calculations with quantitative predictability are 
critical to scaling up laboratory experiments to pilot- or full-scale tests. Despite extensive research over 
the last two decades, there remain many unresolved issues that can limit our ability to make useful en- 
gineering predictions and hence the potential for mercury emission control. This review discusses recent 
progress in the study of reaction mechanisms and kinetics of mercury oxidation over a wide temperature 
range, with a speciﬁc focus on the heterogeneous reaction mechanism of mercury adsorption, conver- 
sion and desorption on solid surfaces. Thermochemical properties of relevant mercury species are the 
basis of thermodynamic predictions. They are reviewed and provided ﬁrst. Various methods and theories 
for evaluating and estimating kinetic rate parameters of elementary reactions are surveyed from existing 
experiments and theoretical studies. Further, the chemical reaction kinetics of mercury oxidation is dis- 
cussed with an emphasis on two primary aspects of the problem: (i) the development of homogeneous 
reaction mechanisms using quantum chemistry calculations and (ii) the advancement of heterogeneous 
reaction mechanisms in which kinetic parameters of surface reactions are ﬁtted to experimental data. 
Various kinetic models are tested against selected experimental data, the corresponding performance of 
each kinetic model is compared and evaluated. Finally, we provide an outlook on the reaction mecha- 
nisms and kinetics of mercury transformation during coal combustion.

1. Introduction 

1.1. Mercury emissions and current policy 

Mercury (Hg) is a global hazardous pollutant released from ge- 
ological  reservoirs  into  the  atmosphere  by  anthropogenic  activ- 
ities  including  fossil  fuel  combustion,  cement  production,  metal 

smelting, and other activities. The Global Mercury Assessment 2018 
[1] found that a new global inventory of mercury emissions from 
anthropogenic sources quantiﬁed global emissions into the air at 
approximately  2220  tonnes.  The  total  atmospheric  mercury  con- 
centration  increases  by  approximately  450%  compared  with  the 
natural  levels  due  to  human  activities  [2] .  Stationary  combus- 
tion of fossil fuels contributes approximately 24% of the total an-

thropogenic  mercury  emissions,  primarily  from  coal  combustion 
(21%) [1] . Therefore, coal combustion (particularly coal-ﬁred power 
plants) is one of the main sources of anthropogenic mercury emis- 
sions [3] . Some policies or standards with stringent emission lim- 
its have been issued to reduce mercury emission from coal-ﬁred 
power plants [4–7] . 

In the United States, a national standard (Mercury and Air Tox- 
ics Standards, MATS) was proposed in 2011 by the US Environmen- 
tal Protection Agency (EPA) to reduce mercury emissions [8] . This 
standard requires 91% mercury removal from the existing coal-ﬁred 
power plants. Subsequently, an updated limit value (1.4–4.1 μg/m 3 ) 
for mercury emissions from power plants was adopted by MATS 
[4] .  In  the  meantime,  activated  carbon  injection  technology  was 
widely implemented to reduce mercury emissions from coal-ﬁred 
power  plants.  The  current  emission  level  of  mercury  from  coal 
combustion in North America is approximately 27 tonnes [1] . In 
Europe, the Industrial Emissions Directive (IED) is the main legisla- 
tive instrument for regulating mercury emissions from coal-ﬁred 
power plants [9] . The new limit value of the IED is 1–10 μg/m 3 
[10] .  The  current  level  of  mercury  emissions  from  coal  combus- 
tion  in  Europe  is  approximately  46.5  tonnes  [1] .  In  China,  the 
Ministry of Environmental Protection issued the emission standard 
(GB13223-2011) for air pollutants from coal-ﬁred power plants in 
2011 [5] . The limit value for mercury emissions is 30 μg/m 3 . Un- 
der the national regulation, ultra-low emission control devices are 
widely used in coal-ﬁred power plants. The current mercury emis- 
sion level is approximately 3.3 μg/m 3  [11] . The projected level of 
mercury emissions is expected to further decline due to the ag- 
gressive measures in the United States, Europe, and China [ 7 , 11 , 12 ]. 
In addition, the Minamata Convention on Mercury, which aims 
to  reduce  global  Hg  pollution,  came  into  force  in  August  2017. 
A  modest  decrease  in  mercury  emissions  from  coal-ﬁred  power 
plants in the United States, Europe, and China has been recorded 
owing to concerted effort s by these countries. Nevertheless, mer- 
cury pollution is still identiﬁed as a key environmental problem in 
the context of global change [13–16] . Therefore, more efforts are 
required to reduce Hg emission from coal-ﬁred power plants. 

1.2. Scope of this review 

During pulverized coal combustion ( > 1400 °C), mercury is va- 
porized and released into ﬂue gas in its elemental mercury (Hg 0 ) 
[17] . As the ﬂue gas cools in the complex post-combustion envi- 
ronment, Hg 0  can be converted to oxidized mercury (Hg 2 + ) and 
particulate bound mercury (Hg p ) via a series of homogeneous and 
heterogeneous reactions [18] . Finally, the mercury species in ﬂue 
gas include Hg 0 , Hg 2 + , and Hg p [19] . HgCl 
2 is commonly regarded 
as  the  main  form  of  oxidized  mercury  [20] .  Hg 2 +  can  be  easily 
removed using a wet ﬂue gas desulfurization (WFGD) system, or 
adsorbed  on  ﬂy  ash  particles  as  Hg p  and  subsequently  captured 
with  high  eﬃciency  using  air  pollution  control  devices  (APCDs) 
[21] . However, Hg 0 is diﬃcult to capture and remove using APCDs 
because of its water insolubility and chemical inertness. As a re- 
sult, mercury emission control in coal-ﬁred power plants relies on 
mercury speciation [ 22 , 23 ]. Therefore, a fundamental understand- 
ing of the chemical reaction mechanisms and kinetics that govern 
the transformation of Hg 0  to Hg 2 +  and Hg p  is crucial to control 
mercury emissions from coal-ﬁred power plants. 

A large number of works have been devoted to the understand- 
ing of the elementary reactions in mercury transformation chem- 
istry and to the development of homogeneous-heterogeneous ki- 
netic models to predict the mercury speciation distribution in coal- 
ﬁred ﬂue gas. However, these kinetic models are still challenging 
for the quantitative engineering predictions [24] . Therefore, there 
is  still  a  motivation  to  deeply  understand  the  complex  mercury 
transformation chemistry and develop reliable and versatile chem- 

ical kinetic models. A state-of-the-art review of the chemical re- 
action  kinetics  of  mercury  transformation  is  necessary  to  high- 
light  recent  advances,  remaining  diﬃculties,  and  future  outlook. 
To  date,  most  review  papers  mainly  focused  on  thermodynamic 
behaviors [25] , deposition chemistry [26] , catalytic oxidation pro- 
cesses [ 23 , 27 , 28 ], and control technologies [ 29 , 30 ]. However, there 
is a lack of a comprehensive and systematic review in the ﬁeld of 
the elementary reaction kinetics governing mercury transformation 
and a comparison of different kinetic models in terms of accuracy 
and performance. 

The objective of this work is to provide an overview of the re- 
action mechanisms and kinetics of mercury transformation in coal- 
ﬁred ﬂue gas. This rest of this paper is organized in the follow- 
ing manner. Section 2 brieﬂy discusses the knowledge of thermo- 
chemistry, and explains mercury speciation distribution in a chem- 
ically  complex  post-combustion  environment  through  thermody- 
namic equilibrium calculations. Section 3 reviews the experimen- 
tal techniques and theoretical methods used to achieve elementary 
reaction  rates.  Sections  4  and  5  summarize  the  progress  on  ho- 
mogeneous and heterogeneous reaction kinetics related to mercury 
transformation over a wide temperature range, respectively. Vari- 
ous subsets of the kinetic models are tested against experimental 
data and the predictive capability of the mechanism is assessed. 
In  Sections  6  and  7 ,  experimental  and  density  functional  theory 
(DFT)-derived  Hg 0  oxidation  mechanisms  over  different  catalysts 
are critically reviewed for mercury transformation at low and mod- 
erate temperatures. Finally, a lot of recommendations are given for 
the future work. 

2. Thermodynamics of mercury transformation 

Chemical  thermodynamics  is  closely  related  to  the  descrip- 
tion of the equilibrium states of multicomponent reaction systems. 
Thermodynamic  calculation  allows  us  to  determine  the  thermal 
and compositional properties of products when the reaction sys- 
tem reaches an equilibrium state. Moreover, thermodynamics plays 
an important role in clarifying reaction kinetics as thermodynamic 
data is used to calculate the reaction equilibrium constants. More 
importantly, the thermochemical properties can be used to bench- 
mark  theoretical  calculations.  Thermochemical  data  can  serve  as 
excellent benchmarks for theoretical model predictions if kinetic 
measurements are not available in the literature. Mercury transfor- 
mation during coal combustion is regarded as a multicomponent 
reaction  system  as  different  gaseous  species  (HCl,  SO x ,  NO x ,  O 
2 , 
etc.) participate in this complex conversion process [31] . Therefore, 
speciﬁc aspects of the thermodynamics of mercury transformation 
are discussed in this section. 

2.1. Thermochemical properties 

2 ,  HgBr,  HgBr 

The  thermochemistry  of  Hg-containing  chemical  species  is  a 
subject of active research interest in combustion chemistry [32] . 
The  thermochemical  properties  (enthalpy  of  formation,  standard 
entropy, and heat capacity) of different mercury species are given 
in Table 1 . The NIST-JANAF Thermochemical Tables [33] can pro- 
vide the thermodynamic data for most of mercury species (Hg 0 , 
HgCl,  HgCl 
2 ,  HgH).  The  gas- 
phase enthalpy of formation (61.38 kJ/mol) of Hg 0 is derived from 
the vapor pressure study conducted at different temperatures [34–
38] .  This  value  is  virtually  adopted  by  the  subsequent  thermo- 
chemical tables [39] . The enthalpy of formation for HgCl, HgBr, HgI, 
HgF and HgH is based on the dissociation energy of molecule into 
gaseous atoms ( D 
0 ) [ 40 , 41 ]. Moreover, the gas-phase enthalpy of 
formation can also be calculated from the enthalpy of formation of 
crystal (National Bureau of Standards [42] ) and the 3rd law heat

thalpy of formation of HgCl 
thalpy of formation ( −293.65 kJ/mol) at 298 K is estimated through 
comparing with other gas-phase mercuric halides and the crystal 
mercuric  ﬂuorides  [33] .  The  heat  capacity  and  entropy  of  these 
abovementioned species are based on the predicted electronic en- 
ergy levels and quantum weights [44] , and complemented by the 
results of spectroscopic data (vibrational and rotational constants) 
[ 45 , 46 ]. 

In  low-chlorine  coal-ﬁred  ﬂue  gas,  HgO  is  one  of  the  main 
oxidized mercury species [50] . The thermochemical properties of 
HgO molecule have received substantial attention from combustion 
community,  and  theoretical  and  atmospheric  physical  chemistry 
community [51–57] . However, there is a disagreement between dif- 
ferent communities about the evaluation of the thermochemistry 
of HgO molecule. In combustion community, the gas-phase ther- 
mochemistry data of HgO molecule mainly comes from the NIST 
Chemistry WebBook [47] . The often-cited enthalpy of formation is 
41.84 kJ/mol, which is obtained from the quantity of gaseous PbO 
[33] . However, a smaller bond dissociation energy of ∼4.0 kcal/mol 
(16.72 kJ/mol)  of  HgO  molecule  can  be  obtained  from  the  high- 
level ab initio calculations [51–53] . This value is calculated from 
the X0 +  ground state of HgO molecule with the consideration of 
the spin-orbit coupling effects, and is much smaller than the NIST 
value (41.84 kJ/mol) [47] . The difference is attributed to the differ- 
ent methods that are used to obtain the enthalpy of formation. The 
theoretical value is widely accepted in theoretical and atmospheric 
physical  chemistry  community.  Thus,  the  enthalpy  of  formation 
(16.72 kJ/mol) listed in Table 1 for HgO molecule is taken from the 
theoretical calculations [51] . The heat capacity and entropy of HgO 
molecule are taken from the NIST Chemistry WebBook [47] . Dur- 
ing the calculation of heat capacity and entropy, the equilibrium 
inter-nuclear separation of gaseous HgO is derived from the related 
value of PbO molecule. The ground state structure of HgO is based 
on the analogy with BeO [33] . It should be stressed here that the 
thermodynamic data of HgO need to be taken with caution. 

OH  is  a  very  important  and  reactive  radical  in  combustion 
chemistry [ 38 , 58 , 59 ]. Moreover, NO x  also exists in coal-ﬁred ﬂue 
gas. Therefore, some mercury species with oxygen moieties (such 
2 , HgONO, ClHgOH, and BrHgOH) may be 
as HgOH, HgNO, HgNO 

important  in  combustion  chemistry  of  Hg.  The  thermochemical 
properties (see Table 1 ) of these mercury species are taken from 
the ab initio calculations using different work reactions [ 38 , 49 , 60–
64 ].  The  template  work  reaction  scheme  (including  the  isogyric 
and isodesmic reactions) is a good method to calculate the stan- 
dard enthalpy of formation of mercury species [38] . The accuracy 
of this method highly depends on the well-established enthalpy of 
formation of reference species. 

SO x is the acid ﬂue gas species produced from coal combustion. 
SO x can react with mercury species to form a lot of complex com- 
2 ) [49] . The 
pounds (such as HgSO, ClHgSO, BrHgSO, and ClHgSO 
presence of these compounds can alter the reaction pathways of 
mercury transformation in coal-ﬁred ﬂue gas. The enthalpy of for- 
mation of HgSO is much higher than those of ClHgSO, BrHgSO, and 
ClHgSO 
2  species  (see  Table  1 ).  This  is  attributed  to  the  stronger 
Hg-S bond dissociation energy of HgSO species [49] . Moreover, Br 
addition leads to a more negative enthalpy of formation of XHgSO 
compared with Cl addition.

To date, the thermochemical properties of other gaseous inor- 
ganic mercury species (HgSO 
2 ) can- 
2 SO 
not be found in the published works and highly-cited databases, 
such  as  the  Active  Thermochemical  Tables  (ATcT)  [65–67] ,  NIST 
Chemistry WebBook [47] , NIST-JANAF Thermochemical Tables [33] , 
Ideal Gas Thermochemical Database [48] , and National Bureau of 
Standards [42] . In the future works, the thermochemical properties 
of these gaseous inorganic mercury species need to be determined 
by experiments or quantum chemistry calculations at the different 
levels of theory. The NASA-polynomial expressions can be used to 
ﬁt the calculated results in two different temperature intervals. 

Mercury transformation in coal-ﬁred ﬂue gas also involves C- 
, H-, O-, N-, S-, Cl-, and Br-containing species. The thermochem- 
ical properties of these species can be obtained from the Active 
Thermochemical Tables (ATcT) [65–67] , THERM program [67] , high- 
level ab initio calculations [68] , and CHEMKIN database [69] . The 
thermochemistry of Cl- and Br-containing species is mainly pro- 
vided by Pelucchi et al.’s [70] and Dixon-Lewis et al.’s [71] works. 

2.2. Equilibrium calculations 

In the high-temperature combustion region ( > 1400 °C) of coal- 
ﬁred boilers, mercury within coal decomposes to form the thermo-

dynamically favored Hg 0 . As the ﬂue gas cools in the post-furnace 
region, oxidation reactions occur for the transformation of Hg 0 to 
Hg 2 +  and Hg p . The transformation eﬃciency is affected by many 
factors such as chlorine content of coal, combustion environment 
(air- and oxy-fuel combustion), ﬂy ash compositions, and operat- 
ing conditions [29] . Thermodynamic equilibrium calculations can 
provide some useful information on the possible mercury specia- 
tion and the corresponding equilibrium concentration [72] . There 
have been numerous studies involved in mercury speciation distri- 
bution in pulverized coal combustion systems through equilibrium 
calculations [ 25 , 72–119 ]. 

Chlorine  is  the  most  important  species  for  mercury  transfor- 
mation  in  the  post-combustion  gasses  [109] .  The  transformation 
of  Hg 0  to  HgCl 
2  occurs  at  the  temperatures  below  about  950 K 
[ 25 , 111 ],  as  shown  in  Fig.  1 (a).  All  of  the  mercury  species  exist 
as HgCl 
2  in the temperature window of 40 0–70 0 K [109] . At the 
temperatures above 950 K, mercury species exist in the forms of 
Hg 0  and  HgO.  Hg 0  and  HgO  account  for  99%  and  1%  of  the  to- 
tal mercury, respectively. HgCl 
2 formation in the temperature win- 
dow of 70 0–90 0 K is determined by the chlorine content of coal. 
The crossover temperature between Hg 0 and HgCl 
2 increases from 
803 K to 1013 K when HCl concentration increases from 50 ppmv 
to  30 0 0  ppmv  [111] .  The  trend  is  consistent  with  other  studies 
[ 88 , 92 , 96 ]. HgSO 
4 condensation is observed when the temperature 
decreases to about 380 K [ 25 , 109 , 120 , 121 ]. In the oxidative system 
4 and HgO are the stable oxidized mercury 
without chlorine, HgSO 
species, as shown in Fig. 1 (b). HgSO 
4 (cr) is the only stable mercury 
species at the temperatures below about 540 K. Hg 0 and HgO exist 
in the region where the temperature is higher than 590 K. 

Oxy-fuel combustion is a promising carbon capture and sepa- 
ration technology [ 122 , 123 ]. Compared with air-ﬁring conditions, 
oxy-fuel combustion environment modiﬁes the behavior and fate 
2 -rich ﬂue gas re-circulation to the 
of mercury because of the CO 
boiler [ 73 , 124–127 ]. The stable temperature range of HgCl 
2 under 
oxy-fuel conditions is much wider than that of HgCl 
2  under air- 
2 molecules can be formed 
ﬁring conditions [74] , because some Cl 
2  and  alkali  chlorides  [ 128 , 129 ]. 
from  the  reactions  between  CO 
Moreover, oxy-fuel combustion environment is favorable for HgO 
formation  [ 73 , 77 , 80 , 84 ].  Mercury  concentration  in  oxy-fuel  com- 
bustion case with 72.1% ﬂue gas recycle is approximately two times 
higher  than  that  in  air-ﬁring  case  [84] .  The  increase  in  mercury 
concentration is attributed to Hg-containing ﬂue gas recirculation 
[86] . During ﬂue gas recirculation, the high-concentration SO 
2 in- 
hibits the transformation of Hg 0 to Hg 2 + and Hg p [79] . 

Some  ﬂy  ash  compositions  (such  as  CaO)  affect  the  mercury 
speciation  distribution  in  coal-ﬁred  ﬂue  gas  [ 81 , 92 , 101 , 113 ].  The 
presence of CaO leads to the decrease of Hg 0 /HgCl 
2  transforma- 

2 via the reaction CaO + 2HCl = CaCl 

tion temperature as CaO inhibits mercury chlorination through the 
consumption of HCl [81] . A part of CaO can be rapidly converted 
to CaCl 
2 O at the tempera- 
tures below 850 K, leading to the consumption of HCl. As the tem- 
perature further decreases to 700 K, HCl is thoroughly depleted for 
CaCl 
2 transformation temperature decreases 
from 750 to 550 K when the mole ratio of CaO/HCl increases from 
1 to 10 0 0 [92] . 

2 formation. Hg 0 /HgCl

The  operating  conditions  (such  as  stoichiometric  ratio,  SR) 
of  coal-ﬁred  boilers  impact  the  ﬂue  gas  compositions  and  the 
transformation  behavior  of  heavy  metals  [ 76 , 117 ].  All  mercury 
species  exist  in  its  elemental  form  under  the  conditions  of 
950 K < T < 1050 K and SR = 0.6 (reducing condition) [101] . How- 
ever, HgCl 
2 and HgO exist in the equilibrium reaction system when 
stoichiometry increases from 0.6 to 1.3 (oxidizing condition). Mer- 
cury transformation in coal-ﬁred ﬂue gas is signiﬁcantly dominated 
by Cl-species. It should be noted that the change in stoichiome- 
try affects Cl-species distribution in ﬂue gas [81] . Under the re- 
ducing condition, HCl is the dominated chlorine species, whereas 
under the oxidizing condition, HCl is the main species with mi- 
nor amounts of Cl radicals ( < 1.5%) at higher temperatures [101] . 
The small amounts of Cl radicals are important for HgCl 
2 formation 
during mercury transformation. 

3. Methods of kinetic studies 

Although thermodynamics links the initial state to the ﬁnal and 
equilibrium states of a reaction system, it cannot provide the in- 
formation about the pathway dominating reaction process and the 
time  approaching  to  chemical  equilibrium  [32] .  Thermodynamic 
equilibrium calculations are subject to several limitations. The ma- 
jor  one  is  that  only  the  information  of  thermodynamic  equilib- 
rium  can  be  predicted  by  these  calculations.  The  assumption  of 
gas-phase thermodynamic equilibrium for mercury species in coal- 
ﬁred ﬂue gas is not valid at the temperatures below about 800 K 
[109] . Mercury transformation in coal-ﬁred ﬂue gas is kinetically 
limited  as  the  ﬂue  gas  rapidly  cools  [ 20 , 22 , 130 ].  The  rates  ap- 
proaching to thermodynamic equilibrium (chemical kinetics) rep- 
resent a signiﬁcant problem which must be generally studied by 
experiments  [118] .  Kinetic  calculation  has  the  ability  to  distin- 
guish between reactions which can and cannot take place under 
the speciﬁed conditions of temperature, pressure and composition. 
Moreover, since mercury transformation has some ﬁnite and char- 
acteristic times deﬁning the related phenomena, chemical kinet- 
ics is necessary for understanding the pathways and rates through 
which reactions proceed during such times [29] .

The measurement of kinetics and branching fractions for mer- 
cury  transformation  reactions  is  experimentally  challenging  be- 
cause of its toxicity, high volatility, and ultra-low concentration ( < 
10  ppb)  in  ﬂue  gas.  Moreover,  the  mercury  speciation  measure- 
ment (Hg 2 + = Hg T - Hg 0 ) has an inherent diﬃculty to distinguish 
the different oxidation states of mercury. The determination of the 
accurate  reaction  rate  coeﬃcients  for  a  speciﬁc  reaction  mecha- 
nism is an intricate task, because this process involves parameter 
calculation procedures for a dynamical model stated in a form of 
differential equations [131] . Over the past decades, substantial ef- 
forts  have  been  made  to  improve  the  experimental  methods  for 
the investigation of mercury reaction kinetics. More crucially, the 
state-of-the-art  quantum  chemistry  and  theoretical  kinetics  have 
been  exploited  to  relate  the  fundamental  properties  of  potential 
energy surface (PES) to experimental measurement. The most pow- 
erful combination of theoretical and experimental studies working 
in consistency has proven to be a successful approach, yielding a 
framework to develop optimized chemical kinetic model that can 
rationally guide the design of new experiments. This section aims 
to review and compare the various methods that are capable of 
providing accurate rate constants of elementary reactions. 

3.1. Experimental techniques 

The accurate measurements of rate constants of mercury trans- 
formation reactions depend on the development of advanced ex- 
perimental techniques. The developed experimental techniques can 
be grouped into four classes: laser induced ﬂuorescence, fast ﬂow- 
discharge, relative kinetic measurements, and absolute rate mea- 
surements. The brieﬂy basic principle, advantages, disadvantages, 
and the utilization of these experimental techniques are presented 
below. 

3.1.1. Laser induced ﬂuorescence 

Laser  induced  ﬂuorescence  (LIF)  is  the  spontaneous  emission 
from atoms or molecules that are electronically stimulated through 
photon  adsorption  typically  in  the  ultraviolet  or  visible  spectral 
range. A molecule will be excited by the laser source to an upper 
electronic state when a photon with energy of hv is absorbed. The 
excited molecule is unstable and will spontaneously undergo radia- 
tive decay from the electronically excited state, emitting another 
photon with energy of hv . The spontaneous emission (ﬂuorescence) 
from the excited molecule can be detected and represented as the 
concentration of corresponding molecule. The detailed basic prin- 
ciple, ﬂuorescence theory, and the related knowledge of LIF can be 
found in the Refs. [ 132 , 133 ]. 

LIF is a quantitative in-situ measurement technique of funda- 
mental reaction kinetics [ 132 , 134 ]. LIF technique can preciously de- 
tect  gas-phase  mercury  [135–138] .  This  technique  possesses  the 
following advantages [ 139 , 140 ]: (1) This technique without essen- 
tial perturbation of the environment possesses high sensitivity and 
ultra-low  detection  limit  (parts-per-quadrillion).  (2)  LIF  can  pro- 
duce relatively strong ﬂuorescence signal intensity with high tem- 
poral and spatial resolutions. The wavelength of the ﬂuorescence 
produced from the excited molecule can be easily discriminated. 
(3)  The  disturbance  of  heterogeneous  reaction  can  be  neglected 
due to the little contact time of ﬂow system. (4) LIF application 
cannot be limited by the pressure of reaction system. This feature 
allows the remote measurements of the local concentration espe- 
cially  under  the  high-temperature  and  high-pressure  conditions, 
such as internal combustion engines [ 133 , 141 , 142 ]. (5) This tech- 
nique shows good performance for the measurement of the fast 
reactions, because the time is only limited by electrons and laser. 
(6) The monochromatic laser with narrow band can be tuned to 
speciﬁc electronic transitions to increase the sensitivity and selec- 
tivity [ 143 , 144 ]. 

Most of elementary reactions of mercury transformation involve 
the participation of active radicals. During the reaction rate mea- 
surements, the interested radicals are ﬁrst produced by the pulsed 
laser photolysis (PLP) of precursor. Therefore, LIF is usually com- 
bined with PLP during the kinetic measurements. The pulsed laser 
photolysis-pulsed laser induced ﬂuorescence (PLP-PLIF) technique 
has been frequently used to study the kinetics of the reaction be- 
tween Hg 0 and radicals, such as Hg 0 + Cl [145] , Hg 0 + Br [146] and 
Hg 0 + OH [140] reactions. 

3.1.2. Fast ﬂow-discharge 

Fast ﬂow-discharge (FFD) technique makes a contribution to the 
high-precise measurement of the rate constants of elementary re- 
actions  involved  in  the  complicated  processes,  such  as  combus- 
tion [147–149] , atmospheric chemistry [ 150 , 151 ] and photochemi- 
cal reactions [152] . A typical FFD system essentially includes [153] : 
(1) Discharge tube, (2) Flow tube, (3) Measuring system of atoms 
and  radicals  concentrations,  (4)  Flowmeters  and  vacuum  valves, 
and  (5)  An  independent  high-vacuum  line  for  gas  handling.  In 
the FFD system, the atoms produced from the discharge tube are 
rapidly pumped into the ﬂow tube under the steady state condi- 
tions.  Meanwhile,  the  time-dependent  concentrations  of  radicals 
are determined by the measurements at different distances along 
the axis of the ﬂow tube. 

In the FFD technique, the atoms or radicals of elementary re- 
actions  are  usually  produced  from  the  radiofrequency  discharge 
[154] , microwave discharge [155] or silent discharge [ 156 , 157 ] at 
low pressure. The utilization of radiofrequency discharge can ef- 
fectively provide a highly stable and pure source of atomic species, 
and  eliminate  a  major  source  of  contaminants  in  the  discharge 
products. The successful utilization of FFD technique includes the 
kinetic measurements of Hg 0 + nitrate radicals [ 155 , 158 ], Hg 0 + O 
3 
[156] , Hg 0 + I [157] and HgH + NO [154] reactions. 

3.1.3. Relative kinetic measurements 

Relative  kinetic  measurement  (RKM)  technique  is  an  indirect 
method for determining the rate constant of elementary reactions. 
In this method, the kinetics of the interested reaction is investi- 
gated relative to the known rate constant of a well-established re- 
action. This technique can be highlighted by its two main advan- 
tages [159] : (1) The kinetic experiments can be readily performed 
under the simulated reaction conditions. (2) The reaction cham- 
bers can connect with several state-of-the-art instruments for de- 
tailed product analysis and rate constant determination. However, 
there are some disadvantages [160] : (1) The relative reaction rate 
constant is highly dependent upon the availability of the reaction 
rate constant of the reference molecule. (2) The calculation of the 
accurate rate constant may be hindered by the complexity of the 
reactants or the enhanced potential of side reactions. Thus, RKM 
technique is appropriate for the pseudo-ﬁrst order reactions. 

Most relative kinetic studies include several reference molecules 
as the accuracy of measured rate constant highly depends on the 
referenced rate constants [161–164] . Experimental measurements 
of relative rates for different elementary reactions should produce 
the  straight  lines  with  near  zero  intercept.  An  example  of  RKM 
technique utilization is the kinetic measurements of the Hg 0 + OH 
reaction [165] . Cyclohexane, 2-methyl propane, and n-butane were 
used as the reference molecules. There is a good linear relationship 
between Hg 0 and different reference molecules. 

3.1.4. Absolute rate measurements 

Absolute rate measurement (ARM) technique is a direct method 
which can quantitatively observe the time evolution of chemical 
species during a complicated or simple reaction. Obviously, com- 
pared with the RKM technique, no reference molecules are needed 

Y. Yang, J. Liu and Z. Wang / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 79 (2020) 100844 

7 

for the kinetic studies using the ARM technique. There is no re- 
lated experimental error caused by the introduction of reference 
molecules. Moreover, ARM technique is a better choice for the ki- 
netic studies if there is no known rate constant of reference reac- 
tion. However, the utilization of the ARM technique in many cases 
may  lead  to  the  kinetic  uncertainties  during  the  calculations  of 
gas-phase rate constant. For example, it is diﬃcult to maintain a 
constant concentration of reactant when a pseudo rate constant is 
calculated [159] . Furthermore, some absolute rate studies are con- 
ducted under the conditions of higher reactant concentration and 
lower pressure. The rate constant obtained under these conditions 
must be properly corrected or extrapolated for its utilization under 
the conditions of coal combustion [160] . In general, ARM technique 
shows a much wider application range for the kinetic studies of 
mercury transformation than the RKM technique. 

The accuracy of rate constants obtained by the ARM technique 
highly depends on the detection instruments. The widely used de- 
tection  instruments  include  cold  vapor  atomic  absorption  spec- 
trophotometer (CVAAS) [166–169] , kinetic absorption spectroscopy 
(KAS) [170] , and mass spectrometry  (MS) [171] . CVAAS can only 
detect the Hg 0 concentration, the intermediates and oxidized mer- 
cury  species  cannot  be  detected  by  the  CVAAS  technology.  The 
ARM technique connecting with CVAAS is generally used for the 
kinetic measurements of overall reactions, such as Hg 0 + Cl 
2 [166] , 
Hg 0 + Br 
2  [169] . Since KAS 
and MS can detect the intermediates and oxidized mercury species, 
the  ARM  technique  connecting  with  KAS  and  MS  is  capable  of 
measuring the rate constants of elementary reactions.

3.2. Theoretical methods 

Computational  chemistry  and  theoretical  studies  have  been 
widely  regarded  as  the  indispensable  parts  of  elementary  reac- 
tion kinetics over the past decades due to the signiﬁcant advances 
in both quantum chemistry and reaction rate theory  [147] . As  a 
consequence, the accurate electronic structure calculations based 
on quantum chemistry have revolutionized our understanding of 
chemical reaction kinetics. It is unrealistic to experimentally mea- 
sure the rate coeﬃcients of elementary reactions over the whole 
pressure-temperature parameter space. The rate coeﬃcients of el- 
ementary reactions that are diﬃcultly investigated by experiments 
can be obtained by using the advanced theoretical methods [172–
174] ,  which  can  extrapolate  the  calculated  kinetic  parameters  to 
the whole pressure and temperature conditions of practical com- 
bustion process. A series of theoretical studies based on quantum 
chemistry have been performed for determining the kinetic infor- 
mation of these elementary reactions [ 50 , 175–185 ]. 

The quantum chemistry calculations are often performed using 
different theoretical schemes (the level of theory and the selection 
of  basis  set).  They  mainly  include  two  important  features  [147] : 
(1) The ability evaluating the system errors caused by the unavoid- 
able simpliﬁcations and neglected effects, and (2) The prediction of 
the simplest and computationally cheapest modiﬁcation with the 
largest improvement in accuracy. However, some quantum chem- 
istry calculations involving multi-electron systems like mercury re- 
main challenging, because relativistic effects become important in 
the core electrons. Additionally, the valence electrons of the multi- 
electron atoms also encounter the relativistic effects due to their 
interactions with core electrons. 

In  order  to  improve  the  calculation  accuracy  of  heavy  ele- 
ments, some efforts have been made to  provide the reliable so- 
lutions treating the relativistic effects [159] . These solutions can be 
mainly classiﬁed into two groups: all-electron and pseudopoten- 
tial methods. The all-electron method is very diﬃcult for the quan- 
tum chemistry calculations of mercury atoms, because the 80 elec- 
trons of mercury make the electronic structure calculations com- 

putationally intensive. Thus, the pseudopotential method consid- 
ering the relativistic effects and the core-valence electron corre- 
lation  is  necessary  for  the  mercury-related  quantum  mechanical 
calculations. In the pseudopotential method, the relativistic effect 
of inner core electrons is replaced by an effective core potential 
(ECP) [ 186 , 187 ]. The basis sets incorporating the relativistic effects 
of  the  mercury  inner  electrons  mainly  include:  RCEP28DVZ  and 
RCEP60VDZ  [188] ,  ECP28MWB  [189] ,  ECP60MDF  [190] ,  LANL2DZ 
[191] ,  Aug-cc-pVTZ-PP  [192] .  RCEP28DVZ  and  RCEP60VDZ  use  a 
relativistic compact effective potential to replace 28 and 60 core 
electrons of mercury atom, respectively. In the Hg/Cl reaction sys- 
tem, the combination of QCISD/RCEP28DVZ can provide the most 
accurate results [ 176 , 182 ], whereas in the Hg/Br reaction system, 
the  most  accurate  predictions  for  the  bond  lengths  of  mercury- 
bromine  compounds  are  provided  by  the  CCSD(T)/AVTZ  level  of 
theory [180] . 

After the validation of theoretical methods and basis sets, reac- 
tion rate coeﬃcients can be calculated using the selected scheme. 
The accuracy of rate coeﬃcients highly depends on the accurate 
potential energy surface (PES) of a reaction, because the crucial PES 
can provide some important parameters (such as activation ener- 
gies). Transition state theory (TST) and Rice-Rampsberger-Kassel- 
Marcus  (RRKM)  theory  are  the  extensively  used  methods  to  de- 
termine the rate coeﬃcients of elementary reactions. In the RRKM 
theory [ 193 , 194 ], a thermal average incorporating collisional effect 
is included in its original form. The microcanonical ensemble of 
unimolecular reactions can be well described by the RRKM  the- 
ory. TST method is mainly used for the kinetic investigation of bi- 
molecular reactions [ 179 , 181 , 182 , 195 ], whereas RRKM theory tradi- 
tionally focuses on the rate coeﬃcients of unimolecular reactions 
[ 177 , 178 ] including dissociation and recombination. A complete re- 
action mechanism of mercury transformation in coal-ﬁred ﬂue gas 
simultaneously includes a series of bimolecular and unimolecular 
reactions. Thus, both TST and RRKM theories are necessary for the 
development of a kinetic model predicting mercury transformation 
in coal-ﬁred ﬂue gas. The detailed knowledge of transition state 
theory and RRKM theory can be found in references [ 196 , 197 ]. 

4. Homogeneous reaction kinetics of mercury transformation 

A complete kinetic model consists of the reaction mechanism, 
thermochemical data, and transport data of the species [ 198 , 199 ]. 
Reaction  mechanisms  consisting  of  a  series  of  elementary  reac- 
tions  provide  possible  pathways  for  the  molecular-level  trans- 
formation  of  reactants  into  products.  Moreover,  reaction  mecha- 
nisms  are  coupled  with  the  thermochemical  data  of  the  species 
to  determine  the  chemical  reaction  rates  based  on  the  princi- 
ple  of  microscopic  reversibility.  In  certain  cases  in  which  dif- 
fusion  is  the  rate-controlling  process,  the  transport  data  of  the 
species  involved  is  also  needed  to  simulate  the  chemical  reac- 
tion process (such as non-premixed combustion). Numerous mass- 
, energy-, momentum- and species-conservation differential equa- 
tions are numerically integrated based on the principle of kinetics 
to calculate the target task, such as the dominant reaction path- 
way, concentration, and heat release proﬁles. The thermochemical 
properties of mercury-containing species have been discussed in 
Section 2 . The homogeneous reaction mechanism and the corre- 
sponding kinetic modeling are presented in this section. The sum- 
marized rate coeﬃcients reﬂect the current level of knowledge of 
the gas-phase chemical kinetics of mercury transformation in coal- 
ﬁred ﬂue gas.

[109] and Sliger et al. [111] in 20 0 0, though studies that used the 
global reaction rates to understand the chemistry of mercury trans- 
formation in ﬂue gas started much earlier (e.g., Ref. [201] ). The ear- 
lier successful works have encouraged a large number of studies in 
more recent years into the reaction chemistry of mercury transfor- 
mation in coal-ﬁred ﬂue gas [24] . Since then, many homogeneous 
reaction  kinetic  models  have  been  proposed  to  predict  mercury 
transformation in simulated ﬂue gas [ 17 , 22 , 50 , 78 , 87 , 88 , 96 , 109 , 176–
182 , 202–227 ]. Moreover, some theoretical studies have also been 
performed in persistent efforts to update rate coeﬃcients through 
the state-of-the-art quantum chemistry calculations [176–182] . 

Evaluation of chemical kinetic models depends on the accuracy 
of  the  existing  experimental  data.  The  accuracy  of  experimental 
data published prior to 2008 has been called into question [228] , 
because the utilization of the Ontario Hydro method for measuring 
the extent of homogeneous mercury oxidation is subject to bias in 
2 [229] . It is clear that 
the presence of chlorine and absence of SO 
uncertainties exist in the accuracy of the developed models which 
are tested by the earlier experimental data during the early stage 
of kinetic mechanism studies [205] . In order to provide the system- 
atic validation for the homogeneous kinetic model, the experimen- 
tal data of homogeneous mercury oxidation was updated by the 
modiﬁed Ontario Hydro method [ 130 , 228 , 230–232 ]. The updated 
eﬃciency of homogeneous mercury oxidation is much lower than 
the earlier experimental data. The updated data has been widely 
used for the systematic evaluation of homogeneous reaction kinetic 
models [ 18 , 78 , 217 , 219 , 220 , 222 ]. 

4.2. Hg/Cl reaction system 

Hg/Cl  reaction  is  the  most  extensively  studied  class  of  mer- 
cury transformation in coal-ﬁred ﬂue gas, because chlorine species 
are  the  most  important  oxidants  responsible  for  mercury  oxida- 
tion [109] . The extensive investigation of Hg/Cl reaction system has 
resulted  in  a  high  ﬁdelity  of  chemical  kinetic  models  which  are 
readily  adopted  into  kinetic  modeling  studies  of  mercury  trans- 
formation.  The  kinetics  of  Hg/Cl  reaction  system  is  well  under- 
stood.  Hg/Cl  reaction  is  mainly  initiated  by  Cl  radicals  produced 
from the decomposition of HCl, and typically followed by the fur- 
ther oxidation of HgCl into HgCl 
2 [ 22 , 87 ]. In the following sections, 
an overview of Hg/Cl reaction kinetics important for homogeneous 
mercury oxidation in coal-ﬁred ﬂue gas is presented. 

4.2.1. Hg/Cl reaction mechanism 

Although there are several Hg/Cl mechanisms for the descrip- 
tion of mercury oxidation by chlorine species, the framework of 
Widmer et al. [200] is more comprehensive from the theoretical 
perspective.  Therefore,  the  elementary  reaction  steps  of  most  of 
Hg/Cl mechanisms published after the year 20 0 0 come from Wid- 
mer  et  al.’s  [200]  framework.  An  example  of  Hg/Cl  mechanism 
is  given  in  Table  2 .  This  Hg/Cl  mechanism  can  be  used  to  pre-

dict mercury transformation in the chemical reaction environment 
(N 
2 O, 10 0–20 0 0 ppm SO x , 10 0–
10 0 0 ppm NO x , 1–10 0 ppm HCl) of the post-combustion ﬂue gas. 
HCl and O 
2  which are present in the reaction system are impor- 
tant for the experimental oxidation data. Hg 0 oxidation can be ini- 
tiated by Cl, Cl 
2 , HCl and HOCl species. HgCl produced from the 
initiating steps can be further oxidized by these chlorine species, 
2 .  The  kinetic  parameters  of  el- 
forming  the  stable  product  HgCl 
ementary  reactions  are  improved  based  on  the  collision  theory 
[ 22 , 202 , 203 ] and the state-of-the-art quantum chemistry calcula- 
tion [ 176–179 , 181 , 182 , 233 , 234 ]. 

The rate parameters displayed in Table 2 for the Hg 0 + Cl + M 
and  HgCl + Cl 
2  reactions  are  based  on  the  assembly  of  different 
kinetic parameters [220] . For example, the pre-exponential factor 
was directly obtained from Ref. [22] . The temperature exponent of 
Ref. [18] was used for the determination of rate constants. The ac- 
tivation energies of the Hg 0 + Cl + M and HgCl + Cl 
2 reactions were 
taken from Refs. [22] and [227] , respectively. The rate constant of 
the Hg 0 + Cl + M reaction is comparable to the hard sphere colli- 
sion limit [ 22 , 202 , 203 ]. The assembled rate parameters have been 
adopted by a series of works [220–222] . 

Regarding the Hg 0 + Cl 

2 and HgCl + HOCl reactions, the rate pa- 
rameters are taken from the theoretical calculation results [227] . 
The  utilization  of  different  levels  of  theory  leads  to  a  large  dif- 
ference  in  rate  coeﬃcients.  The  rate  coeﬃcients  calculated  at 
the  QCISD/CEP-121G  level  of  theory  [227]  are  much  lower  than 
those calculated at the B3LYP/RCEP60VDZ level of theory [ 179 , 195 ]. 
Therefore,  the  different  combinations  of  the  quantum  mechan- 
ical  methods  and  basis  sets  need  to  be  tested  before  the  uti- 
lization. QCISD/RCEP28DVZ provides the most accurate results for 
the  electronic  structure  calculations  of  different  mercury  species 
[ 181 , 182 ].  In  addition,  the  combinations  of  B3PW91/RCEP28DVZ 
and B3LYP/ECP28MWB can provide reasonably theoretical results. 
As  a  result,  the  rate  constants  of  the  Hg 0 + HCl  and  Hg 0 + HOCl 
reactions  were  determined  using  transition  state  theory  at  the 
QCISD/RCEP28DVZ level of theory [ 181 , 182 ]. 

The rate constant of the HgCl + Cl + M reaction is taken from 
the  collision-limited  value  [22] ,  because  the  experimental  mea- 
surements for  the  rate  of  this  reaction are  scarce.  The  collision- 
limited value is three orders of magnitude greater than the the- 
oretical  rate  constant  calculated  at  the  MP4/SDD  level  of  theory 
[227] . Although uncertainties persist in the collision-limited value, 
this value has been adopted by different mechanisms [ 18 , 220 , 226 ]. 
The  rate  constant  of  the  HgCl + HCl  reaction  is  based  on  the 
theoretical work of Wilcox et al. [ 176–179 , 195 , 235 ]. The Hg 0 + HOCl 
2  and  Hg 0 + HCl  reactions, 
reaction  is  faster  than  the  Hg 0 + Cl 
as  shown  in  Fig.  2 .  However,  Hg 0 + HOCl  and  Hg 0 + Cl 
2  reac- 
tions  compete  with  each  other  at  high  temperatures.  HOCl  and 
Cl 
2  are  likely  to  play  a  major  role  in  mercury  oxidation,  but 
atomic chlorine is more likely involved in the dominant oxidation 
pathway.

by  different  elementary  reactions.  Homogeneous  mercury  oxida- 
tion process in the isothermal stage is mainly determined by the 
2 + Cl,  whereas  mercury  oxida- 
reaction  rate  of  HgCl + Cl 
tion  in  the  cooling  stage  is  determined  by  the  reaction  rate  of 
Hg 0 + Cl + M = HgCl + M [22] . 

2 = HgCl 

2 = HgCl 

Homogeneous mercury oxidation occurs in the quench region 
and  begins  at  temperatures  of  around  800 K  [18] .  The  quench 
rate  of  ﬂue  gas  shows  signiﬁcant  effects  on  mercury  oxidation. 
Thus, a typical time-temperature history of coal-ﬁred power plant 
should  be  considered  during  the  kinetic  prediction  of  mercury 
speciation  [17] .  Most  of  experiments  [ 130 , 205 , 227 ]  and  kinetic 
modeling  [ 18 , 206 , 220 ]  suggested  that  high  quench  rate  is  favor- 
able  for  mercury  oxidation.  Mercury  conversion  at  high  quench 
rate  ( −440 K/s)  is  much  higher  than  that  at  low  quench  rate 
( −210 K/s) [205] . As mentioned above, Hg 0 + Cl + M = HgCl + M and 
2 + Cl were found to be responsible for mercury 
HgCl + Cl 
oxidation [ 22 , 111 ]. The recombination reaction (2Cl + M = Cl 
2 + M) 
of Cl radicals is regarded as the most sensitive reaction [18] , be- 
cause  this  reaction  dominates  the  concentration  of  Cl  radicals. 
Moreover,  high  quench  rate  is  favorable  for  the  formation  of  Cl 
radicals [236] . The rapid quench rate of ﬂue gas and the kinetic 
constraints  of  Cl  radicals  recombination  lead  to  a  signiﬁcant  su- 
perequilibirium concentration of Cl radicals. Therefore, the higher 
mercury oxidation at high quench rate is attributed to the longer 
residence time at low temperature region and to the higher con- 
centrations of Cl radicals. These can explain the entire oxidation of 
mercury in the temperature quench environment of sample probe. 
The  Cl/Hg  ratio  of  feed  coal  is  an  important factor  of  homo- 
geneous mercury oxidation in coal-ﬁred ﬂue gas. Mercury oxida- 
tion increases with increasing the Cl/Hg molar ratio. This trend can 
be veriﬁed by the mercury speciation distribution of ﬁve different 
coal-ﬁred power plants [215] . However, a saturation limitation can 
be observed for mercury oxidation eﬃciency when the HCl/Hg ra- 
tio is larger than 40 0 0 [111] , the further increase of HCl concentra- 
tion does not lead to the increase of mercury oxidation. This be- 
havior can be explained by the reason that mercury concentration 
is low enough to limit the reaction rate of Hg oxidation [22] . The 
2 and HCl leads to a near-equal conversion of Hg 0 in 
addition of Cl 
the presence of oxygen [214] . 

Mercury transformation in coal-ﬁred ﬂue gas is also affected by 
the interactions between Cl-species and other species. The com- 
plex interactions can be well understood by kinetic analysis. Dur- 
ing hydrocarbons combustion, the surplus hydrogen and H 
2 O re- 
act with Cl radicals to form HCl, thereby inhibiting mercury oxida- 
tion [214] . However, the inhibitory effect of H 
2 O is much weaker 
than that of hydrogen. Oxygen plays an important role in mercury 
oxidation,  because  it  can  tie  up  hydrogen  as  H 
2 O.  The  addition 
of high-concentration NO x inhibits mercury oxidation by chlorine 
[ 25 , 214 ],  because  several  exothermic  and  catalytic  cycles  lead  to 
the loss of Cl radicals. However, the presence of low-concentration 
NO x promotes mercury oxidation [22] . This is consistent with the 
experimental observations of the ﬂow reactor [130] . SO 
2 shows an 
inhibitory effect on homogeneous mercury oxidation, which is at- 
tributed to an irreversible reaction SO

4.3. Hg/Br reaction system 

Bromine addition can effectively promote the transformation of 
Hg 0  into Hg 2 +  in low-rank coal-ﬁred ﬂue gas with low HCl con- 
centration [237–240] . Bromine compounds can be applied at very 
lower  concentrations.  The  presence  of  bromine  adds  a  new  di- 
mension  to  the  already  complex  chemistry  and  kinetics  of  mer- 
cury  transformations  in  post-furnace  regions  of  coal-ﬁred  boil- 
ers,  which  can  signiﬁcantly  alter  branching  fractions  and  open 
up  new  pathways  for  mercury  oxidation  in  coal-ﬁred  ﬂue  gas. 
Many effort s have been made to investigate Hg/Br reaction chem-

4.2.2. Kinetic modeling of Hg/Cl reactions 

Mercury  concentration  in  coal-ﬁred  ﬂue  gas  is  typically  less 
than 10 ppbv. However, the reaction that does not involve Hg can 
exhibit an indirect effect on mercury oxidation, because these re- 
actions determine the concentrations of important ﬂue gas species 
(HCl,  Cl,  Cl 
2 ,  HOCl,  and  O)  responsible  for  mercury  oxidation. 
Therefore, a complete kinetic model not only includes the Hg/Cl 
sub-mechanism, but also involves other sub-mechanisms such as 
C/H/O/N/S/Cl chemistry, NO x  chemistry and SO x  chemistry. These 
reaction sub-mechanisms simultaneously control mercury transfor- 
mation in coal-ﬁred ﬂue gas. 

Although some homogeneous Hg/Cl mechanisms have provided 
important insight into the qualitative behavior, their quantitative 
accuracy has been called into question [228] . Errors may stem from 
the  utilization  of  aqueous  chemistry  methods  which  are  usually 
used  to  determine  the  extent  of  mercury  speciation  [18] .  More- 
over, some kinetic parameters of elementary reactions of mercury 
and  oxidized  species  have  been  estimated  rather  than  based  on 
the  direct  experimental  measurements.  Ideally,  a  reliable  model 
should be tested by comparison to accurate data with the possibil- 
ity of systematic error elimination. Moreover, a good kinetic model 
can well reproduce the experimental data and predict the experi- 
mental phenomenon under the harsh conditions (high temperature 
and pressure). As shown in Fig. 3 (a), a reasonably good agreement 
is found between the experimental measurements and the recent 
model predictions. The temperature histories of ﬂue gas are shown 
in  Fig.  S1.  The  developed  model  is  tested  by  comparison  to  the 
well-characterized data [210] that is unbiased by mercury oxida- 
tion in the impinge solutions of aqueous chemistry methods. The 
experimental  data  can  be  reasonably  reproduced  by  this  kinetic 
model [220] , although the kinetic calculation results show an en- 
hanced sensitivity of mercury oxidation to the temperature quench 
rate and straddle the experimental data. Moreover, the effects of 
HCl concentration and quench rate on mercury oxidation can be 
successfully  described  by  the  updated  kinetic  model.  Compared 
with other previous modeling effort s, Yang et al.’s [220] mecha- 
nism has a relatively better performance to predict homogeneous 
mercury oxidation in coal-ﬁred ﬂue gas, as shown in Fig. 3 (b). 

The rate of production analysis and sensitivity analysis are the 
powerful tools to analyze the dominant reaction pathway of mer- 
cury oxidation in coal-ﬁred ﬂue gas. Homogeneous Hg 0 oxidation 
proceeds  mainly  through  two  reactions  Hg 0 + Cl + M = HgCl + M 
and  HgCl + Cl 
2 + Cl  [22] .  The  dominant  reaction  path- 
way  of  homogeneous  mercury  oxidation  is  a  two-step  process

depth  by  theoretical  methods  [ 55 , 63 , 64 , 180 , 184 , 185 , 216 , 241–247 ] 
and  experimental  techniques  [ 144 , 146 , 161 , 167 , 248 ].  Some  homo- 
geneous Hg/Br kinetic models have been developed to understand 
the kinetics of mercury transformation in coal-ﬁred ﬂue gas with 
bromine addition [ 78 , 210–213 , 217 , 222–225 , 232 ]. 

4.3.1. Hg/Br reaction mechanism 

The reaction paths converting Hg 0 to HgBr 

2 are initiated by the 
combination of elemental mercury with atomic bromine (Hg 0 + Br) 
[ 64 , 180 , 184 , 241–243 , 246 , 247 ],  molecular  bromine 
2 ) 
[ 180 , 184 , 216 , 242 , 243 , 245 ],  or  hydrogen  bromide  (Hg 0 + HBr) 
[ 180 , 242 , 243 ], and followed by the further oxidation of mercury-

containing intermediates to HgBr 
reactions  among  six  reactive  species  (Hg 0 ,  HgBr,  HgBr 
2 , 
and HBr). 

(Hg 0 + Br 

2 ,  Br,  Br 

The Hg 0 + Br reaction has received substantial attention includ- 
ing experimental measurements [ 161 , 248 ] and theoretical calcula- 
tions [ 55 , 180 , 242 , 243 , 246 , 247 ]. However, these kinetic experiments 
are mainly performed at the room temperature, and thus cannot 
accurately understand the high-temperature chemistry of mercury 
transformation in coal-ﬁred ﬂue gas. The rate coeﬃcients listed in 
Table 3 for the Hg 0 + Br reaction are based on the theoretical work 
conducted by Wilcox et al. [180] at the CCSD(T)/AVTZ level of the- 

ory. The rate constant agrees well with the previously theoretical 
results [ 247 , 249 ], and is in good agreement with the experimental 
measurements [161] . 

The  three-body  collision  reaction  (Hg 0 + Br + M = HgBr + M) 
provides  another  channel  to  form  HgBr.  The  kinetic  parameters 
of  this  elementary  reaction  are  taken  from  the  reaction-rate 
adjustments  based  on  the  hard  sphere  collision  limit  [213] , 
although there are experimental measurements (including a PLP- 
PLIF  study  at  low  temperatures  [146] )  and  theoretical  studies 
(including  a  RRKM  calculation  with  a  master  equation  anal- 
ysis  in  the  temperature  range  of  180–400 K  [246] ).  The  mea- 
sured  rate  constant  from  the  PLP-PLIF  study  is  expressed  as

levels of theory (such as CCSD(T)/AVQZ [245] , CCSD(T)/CBS [184] , 
B3LYP/RCEP60VDZ  [ 180 , 242 ],  and  QCISD(T)/SDD  [243] ).  The  rate 
constants of the four elementary reactions are based on the kinetic 
analysis using transition state theory over the 298–20 0 0 K temper- 
ature  range  [ 180 , 242 ].  During  the  kinetic  analysis,  the  tunneling 
correction factor should be considered for the HgBr + HBr (R8) re- 
action. Moreover, the rate constant of the Hg 0 + Br 
2 (R3) reaction 
can also be determined from its reverse rate coeﬃcient [184] . The 
global  potential  energy  surface  of  HgBr + Br = Hg 0 + Br 
2  includes 
three  smooth  regions:  abstraction  reaction  HgBr + Br → Hg + Br 
2 , 
insertion  reaction  Hg  + Br

2  and  recombination  reaction 
Br + HgBr → HgBr 
2 . The calculated reaction enthalpy with smaller 
errors ( ∼1 kcal/mol) is within the experimental uncertainties. 

Hg 0 + Br 

2 = HgBr 

2  is  an  insertion  reaction  to  accomplish  the 
one-step oxidation of Hg 0 into HgBr 
2 . Although several experimen- 
tal studies focus on the rate measurements of this insertion reac- 
tion at low temperatures [167] , there are accumulative uncertain- 
ties in the ﬁnal kinetic data due to the errors from least-squares 
ﬁts (5-20%), concentration measurements ( < 5%) and reactor sur- 
face adsorption ( < 6%) [161] . Moreover, the high-temperature ex- 
perimental measurements for the rate of this insertion reaction are 
scarce. Therefore, the high-level theoretical calculation appears to 
be  a  more  accurate  representation  of  the  insertion  reaction  rate 
[ 55 , 184 , 216 , 247 ].  The  temperature-  and  pressure-dependent  rate 
constant obtained from the master equation analysis is therefore 
selected for this insertion reaction in Table 3 . The insertion reac- 
tion has a higher activation energy barrier and a very small rate 
constant. The rate constant increases with increasing pressure. 

For  the  HgBr + Br = HgBr 

2  reaction,  the  experimental  studies 
focused  on  the  rate  constant  determination  are  scarce.  How- 
ever,  the  room-temperature reaction  rate  can  be  estimated  from 
2  dissociation  [144] .  Neverthe- 
a  time-resolved  study  of  HgBr 
less,  the  reaction  rate  is  known  less  well  at  the  combustion- 
related temperatures. Thus, the high-temperature reaction rate of 
HgBr + Br = HgBr 
2 is supplemented by a series of deﬁnitive ab ini- 
tio quantum chemistry calculations [ 55 , 180 , 184 , 242 , 246 , 247 ]. A no- 
table  one  is  the  work  of  Wilcox  et  al.  [180]  who  provide  the 
more  accurate  rate  predictions  over  the  298–20 0 0 K  tempera- 
ture  range.  Therefore,  the  rate  coeﬃcients  given  in  Table  3  for 
HgBr + Br = HgBr 

2 are taken from their work. 

4.3.2. Kinetic modeling of Hg/Br reactions 

species 

There  are  some  kinetic  models  to  predict  homoge- 
neous  mercury  oxidation  by  bromine 
[ 78 , 210–
213 , 217 , 219 , 222 , 225 , 232 ].  The  most  comprehensive  experimental 
studies  on  homogeneous  mercury  oxidation  by  bromine  species 
come  from  Silcox  and  coworkers  [ 130 , 230 , 231 , 251 ].  The  exper- 
imental  data  from  the  ﬂow  reactor  is  often  very  reliable,  in 
particular under the conditions using the improved wet condition- 
ing  system  coupled  with  an  online  mercury  analyzer.  Concerns 
include the accuracy of the measured mercury oxidation eﬃciency, 
time-temperature  proﬁle,  and  the  possible  interactions  with  re- 
actor  surface.  No  heterogeneous  mercury  oxidation  over  reactor 
surface and additional oxidation in impinge solution were found 
during these experiments. 

HBr dissociates into the most reactive radicals for mercury ox- 
idation in the typical post-furnace region [ 212 , 213 ]. At high tem- 
peratures ( ≥10 0 0 K), Br radicals formation is controlled by the in- 
teraction between HBr and OH [219] . As the temperature decreases 
below 10 0 0 K, the interaction of HBr with BrO dominates Br radi- 
cals formation. Mercury oxidation by bromine begins at high tem- 
peratures  of  around  1100 K  [219] .  The  dominant  channel  of  ho- 
mogeneous mercury oxidation by HBr is identiﬁed as a two-step 
process  Hg 0 → HgBr → HgBr 
2  [ 212 , 213 ],  whereby Hg 0  is  ﬁrst  oxi- 
dized by Br radicals into HgBr, which is subsequently oxidized by 
2 . At the temperatures below 800 K, the HgBr + Br re-

2 reaction for HgBr 

The  role  of  quench  rate  in  mercury  oxidation  by  bromine  is 
different from that envisioned in Hg/Cl reaction system. The low 
quench rate is favorable for mercury oxidation in the presence of 
bromine [130] , whereas the high quench rate leads to more mer- 
cury oxidation in the Hg/Cl reaction system [205] . The drastically 
different halogen chemistry can explain the different effects of the 
quench rate seen with HBr versus HCl [130] . Although some ki- 
netic models have been developed to predict homogeneous mer- 
cury oxidation in the presence of bromine, most of them cannot 
accurately describe the effects of quench rate, as shown in Fig. 4 . 
Many effort s have been made to enhance the predictive capabil- 
ity of kinetic model [217] . However, the dependence of model pre- 
dictions on quench rate needs to be further improved. These may 
imply mechanistic or parametric uncertainties (e.g., deﬁciencies in 
kinetic  parameters  or  insuﬃcient  reaction  paths),  because  some 
Hg/Br mechanisms are developed by analogy with Hg/Cl mecha- 
nism [ 212 , 213 ]. 

The changes in the combustion environment affect the chem- 
istry and behavior of mercury oxidation by bromine in coal-ﬁred 
ﬂue gas. The different behaviors of mercury transformation in oxy- 
fuel  and  air-ﬁring  combustion  environments  have  been  demon- 
strated by a series of homogeneous experiments [ 230 , 253 ] and ki- 
netic modeling [78] . Oxy-fuel combustion is much more effective 
for mercury oxidation than air-ﬁring conditions. The primary rea- 
2 in 
son is that CO 
the rate-controlling reaction Hg 0 + Br + M = HgBr + M [230] . Under 
the oxy-fuel combustion conditions, the presence of NO and SO 
2 
shows little or no effects on mercury oxidation by bromine. 

2 as a third body is much more effective than N 

Besides  the  abovementioned  kinetic  modeling,  there  are  re- 
cently persistent effort s to develop reliable and versatile chemical 
kinetic model for the description of mercury oxidation by bromine 
[ 222 , 223 ]. The updated experimental data used for model evalu- 
ation is taken from Silcox and coworkers [230] . Model predictions 
are generally in satisfactory agreement with the measured mercury 
oxidation eﬃciency, as shown in Fig. 5 . The temperature histories 
of ﬂue gas are similar to their previous works [130] , as shown in 
Fig. S1. Mercury oxidation increases with increasing HBr concentra- 
tion. Kinetic model captures the mercury oxidation trend well. The 
small deviation between model predictions and experimental data 
is observed under the condition of low HBr concentration (10 and

tion of Hg 0 with I radicals is a factor of 3-4 times slower than that 
of Hg 0 with Br radicals, which is attributed to the smaller binding 
energy of HgI. 

2 ,  Hg 0 + I 

The  rate  constants  of  the  HgI + I 

2 ,  and  HgI + I  re- 
actions  are  mainly  characterized  by  the  theoretical  calculations 
[ 216 , 244 ].  The  calculated  enthalpy  of  the  Hg 0 + I 
2  reaction  is 
27.47 kcal/mol [244] , which is consistent with the calculation re- 
sults  (27.83 kcal/mol)  of  Auzmendi-Murua  et  al.  [216] .  The  slight 
difference between the calculated enthalpies is related to the dif- 
ferent levels of theory. Since the rate constant of the HgI + I 
2  re- 
action is much larger than that of the HgI + I reaction, the HgI + I 
2 
reaction makes a signiﬁcant contribution to HgI 

2 formation. 

There  are  a  lot  of  experimental  measurements  [ 157 , 168 ]  and 
theoretical calculations [ 216 , 244 ] to determine the rate constant of 
the insertion reaction (Hg 0 + I 
2 = HgI 
2 ). These experimental mea- 
surements  cannot  provide  the  consistent  results.  Therefore,  the 
rate  coeﬃcient  listed  in  Table  4  for  this  insertion reaction  is 
taken  from  the  theoretical  calculations  [216] .  The  reaction  en- 
thalpy  ( −32.96 kcal/mol)  obtained  at  the  M06-2X/aug-cc-pVTZ- 
PP  level  of  theory  is  consistent  with  the  experimental  results 
( −33.45 kcal/mol) [33] . Pressure shows a signiﬁcant effect on the 
reaction rate of Hg 0 + I 
2 . Activation energy and temperature 
exponent  increase  with  increasing  pressure.  The  pre-exponential 
factor decreases when the pressure increases from 1 atm to 100 
atm. 

2 = HgI 

4.4.2. Kinetic modeling of Hg/I reactions 

There  is  a  kinetic  model  including  the  Hg/I  reaction  mecha- 
nism [217] . This kinetic model is tested by the Hg/Cl and Hg/Br 
oxidation experiments [130] . However, this kinetic model needs to 
be further evaluated by the Hg/I oxidation experiments. The bond 
energy (71.3 kcal/mol) of HI is much lower than those (87.6 and 
103.1 kcal/mol)  of  HBr and  HCl  [217] . HI easily  dissociates  into  I 
radicals for Hg 0 oxidation. Therefore, iodine shows higher reactiv- 
ity for Hg 0 oxidation than bromine and chlorine. Under gas-phase 
reaction condition, 30 ppmv iodine leads to > 90% mercury oxida- 
tion. 

The quench rate of ﬂue gas shows a signiﬁcant effect on mer- 
cury  transformation  [220] .  Compared  with  the  low  quench  rate, 
the  high  quench  rate  is  favorable  for  Hg 0  oxidation  by  iodine 
species [217] . The effect of quench rate is closely associated with 
the thermochemical properties of iodine and mercury species. The 
high  temperature  region  (140 0 −160 0 K)  is  necessary  for  the  for- 
mation of I radicals, which react with Hg 0 to form the unstable in- 
termediate HgI. During the high quench rate process, the ﬂue gas 
has a longer residence time at the lower temperatures, which are 
necessary for the existence of the unstable HgI species. Thus, more 
HgI species can further react with iodine to form the stable HgI 
2 
species. 

4.5. Hg/O reaction system 

Halogen species are the most important species for mercury ox- 
idation in coal-ﬁred ﬂue gas. However, oxygen species are also im- 
portant for mercury oxidation as oxygen is necessary for HCl con- 
version into chlorine radicals [101] . Some experiments [ 26 , 121 , 257 ] 
and  equilibrium  calculations  [ 79 , 84 , 109 ]  have  shown  that  HgO 
species can be formed through mercury-oxygen interaction. HgO 
in gas phase is stable with respect to Hg 0 and ground state O by 
4 kcal/mol [51] , which is about 0.43 times lower than the Hg –O 
bond  energy  of  HgOH.  Based  on  the  weak  Hg –O  bond  of  the- 
ory, the lifetime (3.01 ms) of gas-phase HgO is estimated from the 
lifetime  of  HgOH.  Moreover,  HgO  production  may  be  important 
for  mercury  transformation  in  low-rank  coal-ﬁred  ﬂue  gas  with 
low HCl content [17] . Therefore, a complete homogeneous kinetic

20 ppmv). However, the deviation decreases with increasing HBr 
concentration. Nevertheless, as mentioned above, there is a signiﬁ- 
cant diﬃculty in capturing the dependence of mercury oxidation 
on  quench  rate.  Therefore,  this  kinetic  model  should  be  further 
evaluated by the experimental data obtained at different quench 
rates. 

4.4. Hg/I reaction system 

Iodine species addition can promote Hg 0 oxidation in coal-ﬁred 
ﬂue gas [ 254 , 255 ]. Iodine species reacts with Hg 0 to form HgI 
2 via 
a series of elementary reactions. Many efforts have focused on the 
thermochemistry and kinetics of Hg 0 oxidation by iodine species, 
including experimental measurements [ 157 , 168 , 256 ] and theoreti- 
cal calculations [ 63 , 216 , 244 ]. The Hg/I kinetic model can reason- 
ably predict mercury transformation in ﬂue gas with iodine species 
[217] . 

4.4.1. Hg/I reaction mechanism 

Currently, Hg/I reaction mechanism includes ﬁve elementary re- 
actions, as shown in Table 4 . Hg 0 oxidation by iodine species is ini- 
tiated by HgI formation (the Hg 0 + I and Hg 0 + I 
2 reactions). Subse- 
2 and 
quently, HgI is further oxidized into HgI 
HgI + I reactions). Moreover, Hg 0 can be directly oxidized into HgI 
2 
species via an insertion reaction (Hg 0 + I 

2 species (the HgI + I 

HgI species produced from the Hg 0 + I reaction can be observed 
by  the  kinetic  absorption  spectroscopy  experiments  [256] .  Since 
the  combination  reaction  of  Hg 0  with  I  radicals  is  much  slower 
than  the  combination  reaction  of  I  radicals,  it  is  diﬃcult  to  ob- 
tain an accurate concentration of the transient HgI species [256] . 
Therefore, little kinetic experiments can be found to measure the 
reaction rate of the Hg 0 + I reaction. However, the rate constant of 
the Hg 0 + I reaction can be taken from the theoretical calculations 
at the B3LYP/CEP-121G level of theory [246] . The combination reac-

model should include the Hg/O reaction chemistry. Most of the ki- 
netic  studies  mainly  focused  on  the  reactions  between  mercury 
and halogen species. Relatively fewer systematic studies have fo- 
cused on the mechanism and kinetics of the Hg/O reaction system, 
as discussed below. 

4.5.1. Hg/O reaction mechanism 

There  are  several  Hg/O  reaction  subsets  that  describe  the 
mercury-oxygen  interaction  [ 17 , 50 , 201 ].  The  widely  used  mecha- 
nism  of  Hg 0  oxidation  by  oxygen  mainly  includes  different  ele- 
mentary reactions, as presented in Table 5 . Flame deposition ex- 
periments have shown that mercury is mainly deposited as HgO 
species  in  chlorine-free  ﬂue  gas  [121] .  Moreover,  little  oxidized 
mercury  species  can  be  found  under  fuel-rich  condition  [101] . 
Therefore,  these  pathways  and  oxygen  species  are  important  for 
mercury  oxidation  in  low-chlorine  or  chlorine-free  ﬂue  gas.  Hg 0 
oxidation can be initiated by atomic O and molecular O 
2 . More- 
over, ozone injection is a promising technology for multiple pollu- 
tants emission control [258] . Thus, Hg/O reaction mechanism also 
includes the O 

3 -initiated reaction. 

2 and Hg 0 + O 

There are some experiments [ 156 , 171 , 201 , 259–261 ] and theo- 
retical calculations [ 50 , 55 , 88 , 181 , 182 , 195 , 243 , 244 ] to determine the 
rate constants of the abovementioned elementary reactions. Even 
though rate constants and product channels are well established 
for the Hg 0 + O 
3 reactions, little experimental mea- 
surements are available for the Hg 0 + O reaction. Only an estima- 
tion [17] and quantum chemistry calculation [195] can be found 
for determining the rate constant of this reaction. The rate coeﬃ- 
cients given in Table 5 for the Hg 0 + O reaction are taken from the 
theoretical calculations [195] . The reaction rate of Hg 0  with O is 
very slow, and should be used with caution for model evaluation 
purposes. The energy barrier (7.51 kcal/mol) of HgO dissociation is 
much lower than that (79.32 kcal/mol) of HgCl 

2 dissociation. 

The rate constant of the Hg 0 + O 

2 reaction is mainly character- 
ized by experimental measurements in the stopped and continuous 
ﬂow reactors [ 201 , 261 ]. No signiﬁcant reaction between Hg 0  and 
O 
2 was observed in these experiments due to the smaller rate con- 
stant. Thus, only an upper limit of the second-order rate constant 
can be obtained (see Table 5 ). Activation energy (116 kcal/mol) was 
estimated from the O = O bond dissociation energy (120 kcal/mol) 
and Hg-O bond formation energy (4 kcal/mol) [262] . The correc- 
tion  in  the  rate  constant  may  affect  the  model  prediction  re- 
sults  (such  as  oxidation  eﬃciency,  reaction  channels,  and  HgO 
production  rate).  The  enthalpy  of  reaction  ( (cid:2)H 
reaction )  was  cal- 
culated  from  the  enthalpies  of  formation  of  reactants  and  prod- 
ucts.  The  Hg 0 + O 
reaction  is  a 
positive value (48.93 kcal/mol) and is much higher than those of 
other three reactions. Clearly, more extensive experimental mea- 
surements and high-level theoretical studies would be needed for 
a more accurate assessment of the rate coeﬃcient of this reaction. 
3  reaction,  the  rate  constant  is  derived  from 
a  lot  of  experimental  measurements  [ 165 , 171 , 259 , 260 ]  and  the- 
oretical  calculations  [ 50 , 88 , 181 , 182 , 243 ].  Fig.  6  shows  an  Arrhe- 
nius plot for the rate constant of the Hg 0 + O 
3  reaction. The ex- 
perimental  measurements  of  the  high-temperature  reaction  rate 

2  reaction  is  endothermic,  since (cid:2)H

are scarce. Although the methods used in these theoretical works 
have been tested by comparing the calculated geometries, vibra- 
tional  frequencies,  and  reaction  enthalpies  to  experimental  data, 
all theoretical calculations underpredict the experimentally mea- 
sured rate constant. The deviation may be attributed to the uncer- 
tainties of experimental measurements or/and theoretical calcula- 
tions, e.g., the diﬃculties associated with mercury measurement, 
the surface-induced reactions on reactor wall, and the selection of 
methods/basis  sets.  In  these  theoretical  works,  the  utilization  of 
different methods leads to substantial differences for the calculated 
rate constants. Compared with Xu et al.’s [ 50 , 88 ] and Gao et al.’s 
[243] works, Zheng and Liu et al.’s [ 181 , 182 ] works give a relatively 
more accurate rate constant for the Hg 0 + O 

The Hg 0 + OH reaction that is observed in atmospheric chem- 
istry  may  play  an  important  role  in  mercury  transformation  in 
coal-ﬁred ﬂue gas. Although experimental and theoretical studies 
have  focused  on  the  Hg 0 + OH  reaction  [ 49 , 140 , 163 , 165 , 246 , 263 ], 
there  is  a  disagreement  about  the  rate  constant  of  this  reaction 
[264] . The utilization of different reference molecules is responsi- 
ble for the differences of experimental measurements. The struc- 
ture of HgOH species is very sensitive to the method and basis set 
during theoretical calculations. Conceivably, the ab initio calcula- 
tions of rate constants need to be performed at the high level of 
theory. The rate coeﬃcients listed in Table 5 for the Hg 0 + OH reac- 
tion are taken from the theoretically updated value of Dibble et al. 
[262] .

4.5.2. Kinetic modeling of Hg/O reactions 

The kinetic understanding of HgO formation pathway depends 
on the development of Hg/O chemical reaction model. The perfor- 
mance of some kinetic models is sensitive to temperature [17] . At 
the higher temperatures, model predictions are in good agreement 
with experimental data. At the lower temperatures below 630 °C,

the  kinetic  model  underpredicts  the  experimental  data.  A  lot  of 
uncertainties exist in the kinetic model due to the deﬁciency of 
performance test [208] . In addition, uncertainties also exist in the 
accuracy of previous kinetics and thermochemistry of HgO. There- 
fore, the Hg/O reaction mechanism needs to be re-run with the 
corrected kinetics and thermochemistry of HgO. The performance 
of Hg/O reaction mechanism should be further tested by updated 
experimental data of mercury oxidation by oxygen. 

The  contribution  of  oxygen  species  to  mercury  oxidation  in 
coal-ﬁred ﬂue gas can be analyzed by kinetic modeling. O 
2 weakly 
enhances homogeneous mercury oxidation  [50] , especially under 
the  conditions  of  low  chlorine  concentration.  HgO  contributes 
approximately  1.5–6.0%  of  the  total  oxidized  mercury  species. 
Hg 0 + ClO = HgO + Cl provides an important channel for HgO pro- 
duction.  Moreover,  kinetic  modeling  can  be  used  to  predict  the 
amount  of  ozone  injection.  During  the  low-temperature  reaction 
process  of  mercury  oxidation  by  ozone  [218] ,  mercury  oxidation

eﬃciency increases with increasing O 
idation eﬃciency increases from 5% to 30% when the O 
3 /NO mole 
ratio increases from 1.0 to 2.0. 

4.6. Hg/N reaction system 

The reactions of mercury species with nitrogen oxides (NO 

2 and 
NO)  are  widely  observed  in  the  ﬁeld  of  atmospheric  chemistry 
[ 60 , 61 , 63 , 64 , 185 , 265 ].  Nitrogen  oxides  can  be  formed  during  the 
high-temperature  combustion  process  [ 266 , 267 ].  Obviously,  mer- 
cury transformation in coal-ﬁred ﬂue gas also involves the reac- 
tions of mercury with nitrogen oxides [49] , as shown in Table 6 . 
2 , 
Different  N-containing  mercury  species  (such  as  HgNO,  HgNO 
HgONO) can be produced via these elementary reactions. Experi- 
mental studies cannot provide accurate rate constants of these ele- 
mentary reactions due to the limitation of the used CVAAS method 
[201] . The reaction enthalpies of the elementary reactions can be 
obtained from the theoretical calculations [49] . 

The Hg/N reaction mechanism can be used to explain the for- 
mation  of  N-containing  mercury  species  in  coal-ﬁred  ﬂue  gas. 
Moreover, the kinetic model containing the Hg/N reaction mech- 
anism can also predict the effects of NO x species on mercury oxi- 
dation. For example, the Hg/N reaction mechanism has been incor- 
porated into a kinetic model to predict the effects of NO on Hg 0 
oxidation by halogen species [217] . NO shows an inhibitory effect 
on Hg 0 oxidation because of the consumption of halogen species. 
Hg 0 oxidation by halogen species can be reasonably predicted by 
this  kinetic  model.  However,  the  predictive  capability  of  this  ki- 
netic model needs to be further improved under the condition of 
low quench rate. Moreover, this kinetic model should be tested by 
the formation of the N-containing mercury species. 

4.7. Hg/S reaction system 

Sulfur dioxides (SO x ) are the main products of sulfur oxidation 
during coal combustion. HgSO 
4 is one of the main oxidized mer- 
cury species in chlorine-free ﬂue gas [ 25 , 109 , 120 , 121 ]. Some reac- 
2 ) play an important 
tion intermediates (such as HgSO and HgSO 

4 formation. Two elementary reactions are responsible 
role in HgSO 
for HgSO and HgSO 
2 formation, as shown in Table S1. SO is a reac- 
tive radical and can react with Hg 0 to form HgSO. Moreover, Hg 0 
can also react with SO 
2 species. The reaction en- 
thalpies of the Hg 0 + SO and Hg 0 + SO 
2 reactions are 20.9 kcal/mol 
and −3.0 kcal/mol, respectively. These values are obtained from the 
ab initio calculations at the M06-2X/AVTZ level of theory [49] . 

2 to produce HgSO 

The Hg/S reaction mechanism can be incorporated into kinetic 
model to explain the effects of SO x species on mercury oxidation 
in coal-ﬁred ﬂue gas. The interaction between Hg 0 and SO x can be 
elucidated by the Hg/S reaction mechanism. To date, there is a ki- 
netic model including the Hg/S reaction mechanism [217] . SO 
2 in- 
hibits mercury oxidation in the presence of chlorine species. How- 
ever, SO 
2 shows little effects on mercury oxidation in the presence 
of bromine and iodine species. This is associated with the lower 
bond dissociation enthalpies of BrSO 

2 and ISO 

2 species. 

5. Heterogeneous reaction kinetics of mercury transformation 

It is well-known that a large amount of ﬂy ash exists in coal- 
ﬁred ﬂue gas. Fly ash particles are believed to exhibit catalytic ox- 
idation  activity  for  mercury  transformation  [ 18 , 27 , 130 , 268 ].  Con- 
sequently,  the  mercury  transformation  routes  include  homoge- 
neous  gas-phase  reactions  and  heterogeneous  gas-solid  interac- 
tions [ 24 , 220 ]. It has been reported that the mercury transforma- 
tion process is dominated by heterogeneous chemistry in practical 
combustion systems [ 20 , 130 , 257 ]. As a result, the quantitative ac- 
curacy of model prediction using the homogeneous reaction mech- 
anism has been called into question under realistic ﬂue gas condi- 
tions [ 24 , 224 ]. Therefore, a complete and reliable chemical kinetic 
model should consider the homogeneous/heterogeneous chemistry 
coupling. The homogeneous kinetic model has been reviewed in 
Section 4 . In the following sections, the development of the het- 
erogeneous mechanism of mercury oxidation over different active 
components  within  ﬂy  ash  is  outlined.  The  predictive  capability 
of  homogeneous-heterogeneous  kinetic  models  is  evaluated.  The 
rate constants speciﬁed in this section represent the current state 
of knowledge of heterogeneous oxidation mechanism for mercury 
transformation in coal-ﬁred ﬂue gas. 

5.1. Historical perspective 

Over the past two decades, many heterogeneous mechanisms 
have  been  proposed  to  describe  the  reaction  chemistry  of  mer- 
cury transformation in the actual coal-ﬁred ﬂue gas. The ﬁrst het- 
erogeneous Hg/Cl mechanism for mercury oxidation by HCl over 
unburned carbon (UBC) within coal-derived ﬂy ash was proposed 
by  Nikas  et  al.  [ 202 , 203 ],  and  was  evaluated  by  comparison  to 
lab-scale and pilot-scale experimental data (pulverized coal com- 
bustion).  Since  then,  more  attentions  have  been  devoted  to  the 
deeper understanding of heterogeneous mercury oxidation chem- 
istry  on  UBC  surface,  including  quantum  chemistry  calculations 
[269–276] and kinetic modeling [ 18 , 204 , 212 , 277 ]. The community 
has also realized that the inorganic components (such as iron ox- 
ides) within ﬂy ash exhibit the catalytic activity for mercury oxi- 

Y. Yang, J. Liu and Z. Wang / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 79 (2020) 100844 

15 

dation in coal-ﬁred ﬂue gas [278–280] . Moreover, it is widely ac- 
cepted that mercury transformation is signiﬁcantly affected by the 
surface reaction chemistry of competitive adsorption among differ- 
ent ﬂue gas species (such as SO x , NO x , HCl, and H 
2 O) on ﬂy ash 
surface [281–283] . Therefore, the ﬁrst attempt to investigate the 
catalytic reaction chemistry of Fe 
3 and the competitive adsorp- 
tion mechanism of ﬂue gas species was made by Yang et al. [220–
224] to improve the predictive capability of kinetic model. 

2 O 

The  above  historical  perspective  highlights  the  data-driven 
method to develop state-of-the-art kinetic models for a compre- 
hensive  understanding  of  mercury  transformation  in  the  actual 
coal-ﬁred  ﬂue  gas.  As  previously  mentioned,  the  mercury  trans- 
formation  behavior  over  a  wide  temperature  range  can  be  suc- 
cessfully predicted without the need to adjust the kinetic param- 
eters. Nevertheless, most of the experimental data used for model 
evaluation are mainly obtained using atomic absorption spectrom- 
etry  or  atomic  ﬂuorescence  spectrometry.  However,  these  mer- 
cury concentration measurement techniques cannot be used to di- 
rectly measure the oxidized mercury species and reaction interme- 
diates. Moreover, different oxidized mercury species cannot be dis- 
tinguished by these measurement techniques. Therefore, uncertain- 
ties exist in the experimental measurements of mercury oxidation 
eﬃciency, which implies that the experimental results should be 
used with caution for model evaluation purposes. 

The following sections will further discuss the details of het- 
erogeneous mercury oxidation chemistry, including the surface re- 
action mechanism and kinetic model development. The fundamen- 
tal understanding of the reaction mechanism serves as the basis 
for developing the heterogeneous kinetic model. Consequently, the 
kinetic modeling effort s will be discussed in the following order: 
mechanistic investigation, model development, and kinetic model- 
ing. 

5.2. Reaction chemistry over unburned carbon within ﬂy ash 

It is well known that unburned carbon within ﬂy ash shows the 
highest catalytic reaction activity for mercury oxidation compared 
to other inorganic components [ 27 , 278 , 284–294 ]. Therefore, most 
of the heterogeneous kinetic models were mainly developed based 
on the surface reaction mechanism of mercury oxidation over un- 
burned carbon. 

5.2.1. Heterogeneous Hg/Cl mechanism and kinetic model over 
unburned carbon 

Experiments  and  quantum  chemistry  calculations  [ 269–
276 , 282 , 295–299 ]  can  provide  insights  into  the  interaction 
between  Hg 0  and  unburned  carbon  surface.  The  structure  of 
unburned  carbon  within  ﬂy  ash  is  similar  to  that  of  graphene 
[300] . During the quantum chemistry calculations, the single-layer 
graphene structure is commonly used to represent the unburned 
carbon  [301–304] .  As  a  result,  theoretical  calculations  based  on 
graphene  surface  can  provide  a  fundamental  understanding  of 
heterogeneous  reaction  mechanism  of  mercury  oxidation  over 
unburned carbon. 

The  amount  and  types  of  active  sites  provide  the  important 
information for the development of heterogeneous kinetic model. 
The unsaturated carbon atoms are the active sites of Hg 0 adsorp- 
tion on unburned carbon surface [270] . The physisorption mech- 
anism  is  responsible  for  Hg 0  adsorption  over  unburned  carbon 
[ 275 , 295 ], the adsorption energy of Hg 0 on unburned carbon sur- 
face  ranges  from  −18.07 kJ/mol  to  −44.60 kJ/mol.  The  presence 
of carbon vacancy enhances the activity of its neighboring sites, 
thereby  promoting  Hg 0  adsorption  on  unburned  carbon  surface 
[298] . The adsorption energy of Hg 0 on defective surface is much 
higher than that of Hg 0 on perfective surface. Moreover, the exis- 
tence of oxygen functional groups also affects mercury adsorption 

or oxidation on unburned carbon surface [ 274 , 295 ]. For example, 
lactone,  carbonyl  and  semiquinone  groups  promote  mercury  ad- 
sorption. Conversely, phenol and carboxyl groups are unfavorable 
for mercury adsorption due to the repulsive interaction. 

Chlorine  is  the  most  important  species  for  mercury  transfor- 
mation  in  coal-ﬁred  ﬂue  gas,  and  plays  a  promotional  effect  on 
Hg 0  adsorption  over  unburned  carbon  [ 270 , 295 ].  Hg 0  adsorption 
is enhanced by the pre-adsorption of Cl atom on unburned car- 
bon surface. The chemical adsorption mechanism is responsible for 
the strong interaction between oxidized mercury species (i.e., HgCl 
and HgCl 
2 ) and unburned carbon surface [270] , including dissocia- 
tive and non-dissociative adsorption. HgCl can stably exist on the 
unburned carbon surface and serve as an important intermediate 
for mercury oxidation by HCl. Moreover, HgCl can react with the 
pre-adsorbed Cl atom to form HgCl 
2 molecule 
easily desorbs from unburned carbon surface due to its unstability. 
Additionally, other ﬂue gas species produced from coal combus- 
tion exhibit inhibitory or promotional effects on mercury adsorp-

tion. For example, SO

2  inhibits Hg 0  adsorption be- 
However, the high-concentration SO 
cause  of  the  competitive  adsorption  between  Hg 0  and  SO 
2 .  SO 
3 
also shows inhibitory effects on Hg 0 adsorption over unburned car- 
bon [297] , because SO 
3 broadens the LUMO-HOMO energy gap of 
the carbonaceous surface. 

2 . The formed HgCl 

The abovementioned theoretical studies mainly focused on the 
comparison of adsorption energy, the more important kinetic pa- 
rameters  (such  as  activation  energy  and  pre-exponential  factor) 
of  elementary  reactions  of  mercury  oxidation  on  unburned  car- 
bon  surface  are  still  unknown  for  the  development  of  heteroge- 
neous kinetic model. The available adsorption energy cannot pro- 
vide the deeper kinetic understanding for the reaction mechanism 
of mercury oxidation over unburned carbon. The oxidation reac- 
tivity  of  unburned  carbon  may  not  just  rely  on  the  adsorption 
energy  calculations.  The  activation  energy  barrier  and  rate  con- 
stant can be found in an extended study [276] . The activation en- 
ergy barrier of Hg 0  oxidation into HgCl over unburned carbon is 
in the range of 38.89–55.76 kcal/mol. The rate constant increases 
from  1.64  × 10 −17  s −1  to  2.73  × 10 −8  s −1  when  the  tempera- 
ture  increases  from  298 K  to  433 K.  The  oxidation  step  of  HgCl 
2 presents a relatively higher activation energy barrier of 
into HgCl 
85.80 kcal/mol. 

should  be 

The  heterogeneous  mechanism 

combined 
with  the  homogeneous  mechanism  to  develop  a  homoge- 
neous/heterogeneous  kinetic  model  [ 18 , 305 ].  In  most  of  kinetic 
models [ 202 , 203 , 212 , 213 , 220–222 ], the rate coeﬃcients of hetero- 
geneous reactions are based on the sticking coeﬃcients. Sticking 
coeﬃcient represents the probability that a certain process takes 
place  when  a  collision  between  a  given  gas-species  occurs  with 
the  surface  [220] .  Physically,  sticking  coeﬃcient  denotes  the 
probability that a speciﬁc collision will generate the products in 
a  particular  reaction  channel.  In  some  kinetic  models  [ 204 , 277 ], 
the rate coeﬃcients of heterogeneous reactions are based on the 
Arrhenius  parameters.  Although  the  reaction-rate  parameters  of 
several  speciﬁc  heterogeneous  reactions  have  been  provided  by 
the abovementioned quantum chemistry calculations [276] , most

updated  heterogeneous  mechanism  of  mercury  oxidation  by  HCl

After the development of homogeneous/heterogeneous kinetic 
model, the predictive capability should be evaluated by experimen-

ing  the  parameter-ﬁtting  experimental  data  to  evaluate  the  pre- 
dictive  capability  of  the  kinetic  model  is  not  reasonable.  Thus, 
the developed homogeneous/heterogeneous kinetic model should

be assessed by the different sets of experimental data. For exam- 
ple, the kinetic model of Niksa et al. [ 202 , 203 ] was tested by dif- 
ferent experimental data from 1-MW t  and 29-MW t  furnace, and 
subsequently used to predict the mercury emission from different 
coal-ﬁred power plants [306–308] . Another comprehensive kinetic 
model was also evaluated by different experimental data and suc- 
cessfully predicted the mercury speciation distribution in a 1-MW t 
semi-industrial-scale coal-ﬁred furnace [85] , as shown in Fig. 7 (a). 
Mercury  oxidation  in  coal-ﬁred  ﬂue  gas  is  mainly  controlled  by 
unburned  carbon  (UBC)  content  and  HCl  concentration  [220] .  At 
low UBC level, the availability of UBC active sites determines mer- 
cury oxidation, whereas at high UBC level, HCl availability becomes 
dominant for mercury oxidation. Mercury oxidation under the con- 
ditions  of  higher  UBC  level  is  much  more  sensitive  to  HCl  con- 
centration variations than that under the conditions of lower UBC 
level. 

Compared  with  homogeneous  reaction,  heterogeneous  reac- 
tion  makes  a  signiﬁcant  contribution  to  mercury  oxidation  (see 
Fig.  7 (b)).  StCl(s) + Hg 0 → StHgCl(s)  provides  an  important  chan- 
nel  to  oxidize  Hg 0  at  the  highest  rate,  and  produces  64%  of 
the total oxidized mercury. Moreover, 24.6% of oxidized mercury 
is  produced  via  StCl(s) + Hg 0 → StSA(s) + HgCl.  As  a  result,  88.6% 
of  oxidized  mercury  is  generated  on  unburned  carbon  surface. 
StHgCl(s) + HCl → StSA(s) + HgCl 
2 + H is the main production chan- 
nel  of  HgCl 
2 .  In  addition,  4.5%  of  oxidized  mercury  is  generated 
from the Hg 0 + Cl + M → HgCl + M. Therefore, the dominant path- 
way of mercury transformation in coal-ﬁred ﬂue gas is a two-step 
process: Hg 0 → StHgCl(s) → HgCl 
2 . 

5.2.2. Heterogeneous Hg/Cl/Br mechanism and kinetic model over 
unburned carbon 

Bromine addition can signiﬁcantly enhance mercury oxidation 
in coal-ﬁred ﬂue gas, because bromine is much more effective than 
chlorine in mercury oxidation [130] . Moreover, bromine addition 
remarkably alters the reaction chemistry of mercury transforma- 
tion in coal-ﬁred ﬂue gas. The existence of some cross-reactions 
makes the heterogeneous reaction mechanisms and kinetics more 
complicated for the understanding of mercury transformation. The 
development  of  heterogeneous  kinetic  model  highly  depends  on 
the accurate understanding of surface reaction chemistry of mer- 
cury  oxidation  over  unburned  carbon.  Some  experiments  [271–
273] , quantum chemistry calculations [ 275 , 276 ] and kinetic studies 
[ 212 , 213 , 222 ] have been undertaken to understand the heteroge- 
neous reaction mechanisms and kinetics of mercury oxidation over 
unburned carbon in the presence of bromine species. 

Hg 0  adsorption on unburned carbon surface is mainly related 
to the adsorbed Br atoms. Bromine shows an effective effect on 
Hg 0  adsorption over unburned carbon due to the charge transfer 
[ 275 , 295 ]. The adsorbed mercury has an oxidation state of Hg 2 + 
and coordinates with two Br atoms, which can be conﬁrmed by 
the  X-ray  photoelectron  spectroscopy  (XPS)  and  extended  X-ray 
absorption  ﬁne  structure  (EXAFS)  spectroscopy  studies  [ 271 , 272 ]. 
HgBr is stably adsorbed on the edge carbon sites through the inter- 
action between Br and C atoms [272] , and serves as an important 
intermediate  for  mercury  oxidation  [275] .  The  existence  of  NO x 
species promotes mercury oxidation on brominated carbon surface, 
2 shows inhibitory effects on Hg oxidation [273] . 
while SO 

Hg 0  oxidation  by  bromine  species  on  unburned  carbon  sur- 
face  is  kinetically  controlled  [272] .  The  energy  barrier  and  rate 
constant of Ref. [276] can provide the important kinetic informa- 
tion for Hg 0 oxidation by bromine over unburned carbon. During 
the heterogeneous mercury oxidation, the ﬁrst step (Hg 0 → HgBr) 
is activated by 47.88 kcal/mol. The further oxidation of HgBr into 
HgBr 
2  presents  a  relatively  higher  activation  energy  barrier  of 
75.21 kcal/mol. The rate constant of HgBr formation during hetero- 
geneous Hg 0  oxidation at 298 K is 4.26 × 10 −12  s −1 . The second 
oxidation step (HgBr → HgBr 
2 ) is the rate-determining step of mer- 
cury oxidation by bromine species. 

The  heterogeneous  reaction  scheme  of  mercury  oxidation  by 
bromine  species  over  unburned  carbon  is  more  complex  than 
the  heterogeneous  Hg/Cl  reaction  scheme,  because  HBr  is  much 
more  dissociative  than  HCl  under  the  typical  postﬂame  condi- 
tions  [ 212 , 213 ].  Molecular  Br 
2  produced  from  Br  radicals recom- 
bination exists in the concentrations that are comparable to HBr 
levels.  Given  the  roles  of  Br 
2  and  Br  in  heterogeneous  mercury 
oxidation,  the  reactions  between  mercury  and  bromine  species 
(Br 
2  and  Br)  should  be  included  in  the  heterogeneous  Hg/Br 
mechanism,  as  shown  in  Table  S3.  Since  chorine  species  ex- 
ist  in  coal-ﬁred  ﬂue  gas,  the  heterogeneous  Hg/Br  mechanism 
should  be  combined  with  the  aforementioned  Hg/Cl  mechanism 
to form a combined homogeneous/heterogeneous Hg/Cl/Br kinetic 
model. 

The evaluation of the combined Hg/Cl/Br kinetic model relies on 
the availability of experimental data. For example, the experimen- 
tal data of bromine-addition ﬁeld tests in three different coal-ﬁred 
power plants have been used to evaluate the predictive capabil- 
ity of the combined Hg/Cl/Br kinetic model [ 212 , 213 ], as shown in 
Fig. 8 . The developed kinetic model can reasonably predict the ef- 
fects of bromine addition on mercury removal. Mercury removal 
eﬃciency increases with increasing bromine addition, because Hg 0

2 . At high temperatures, most 
can be eﬃciently oxidized into HgBr 
of HgBr 
2  is formed heterogeneously on unburned carbon surface. 
The heterogeneous recombination reaction of Br radicals over un- 
burned carbon maintains a relatively small population of adsorbed 
Hg-Br species, inhibiting the formation of particulate bound mer- 
cury. As a result, bromine addition can signiﬁcantly promote Hg 0 
oxidation in coal-ﬁred ﬂue gas, but cannot enhance the formation 
of additional particulate bound mercury. 

The accuracy of a kinetic model needs to be further assessed 
when new and more accurate experimental data are available. Fol- 
lowing such a process, the predictive capability of a kinetic model 
can be improved as the excellent agreement is obtained between 
experimental data and model predictions. For example, the latest 
Hg/Cl/Br  kinetic  model  of  Ref.  [222]  was  assessed  by  the  well- 
characterized measurements from a slipstream reactor [239] , and 
tested  by  793-MW t  full-scale  experimental  data  [311] .  The  com- 
bined homogeneous/heterogeneous model accurately predicts mer- 
cury oxidation at different HBr concentrations. HBr concentration 
has  a  major  impact  on  mercury  oxidation.  In  coal-ﬁred  power 
plants,  about  150  ppmw  Br  loading  on  coal  (approximately  3.5 
ppmv HBr in ﬂue gas) leads to a Hg 0 oxidation eﬃciency of > 90%. 
Therefore, the utilization of bromine addition at low concentration 
can achieve 90% mercury emission control. 

As mentioned previously, mercury transformation in coal-ﬁred 
ﬂue  gas  is  dominated  by  chlorine-related  reactions.  However, 
bromine  addition  alters  the  dominant  reaction  pathway  of  mer- 
cury transformation in coal-ﬁred ﬂue gas. Reaction path analysis 
is a powerful tool to provide a visual representation of complex 
reaction  system,  and  has  been  successfully  used  to  analyze  the 
reaction  path  diagram  of  mercury  transformation  (see  Fig.  9 ) 
[222] and NO reduction [ 312 , 313 ]. During mercury transformation, 
about 79.2% of consumed Hg 0  is oxidized into gaseous HgBr via 
StBr(s) + Hg 0 → StSA(s) + HgBr. However, most of the gaseous HgBr 
decomposes  into  Hg 0  via  the  homogeneous  reactions  at  high 
temperatures. StBr(s) + Hg 0 → StHgBr(s) provides another pathway 
for Hg 0 oxidation. Most of StHgBr(s) is further oxidized into HgBr 
2 
via  StHgBr(s) + HBr → StSA(s) + HgBr 
2 + H.  The  dominant  channel 
of  mercury  transformation  in  coal-ﬁred  ﬂue  gas  with  bromine 
addition is controlled by two reactions: StBr(s) + Hg 0 → StHgBr(s) 
2 + H.  Hg 0  oxidation  in 
and  StHgBr(s) + HBr → StSA(s) + HgBr 
ﬂue  gas  mainly  occurs  through  the  Br-containing  reactions. 
Therefore,  HBr  is  much  more  active  than  HCl  in  mercury 
oxidation.

5.3. Reaction chemistry over transition metal oxides within ﬂy ash 

Fly ash plays an important role in mercury transformation due 
to its catalytic oxidation activity. The chemical compositions of ﬂy 
ash are suggested to be an important factor with respect to mer- 
cury oxidation. Some inorganic components within ﬂy ash are ex- 
pected to show catalytic oxidation activity for Hg 0 oxidation. Some 
3 ) and cop- 
experiments have demonstrated that ferric oxide (Fe 
per oxide (CuO) within ﬂy ash exhibit catalytic activity for mer- 
cury oxidation in the presence of HCl [ 278 , 279 , 284 , 289 , 314–319 ]. 
To develop the heterogeneous kinetic model involving the catalytic 
activity of Fe 
3 and CuO within ﬂy ash, the corresponding reac- 
tion mechanism of mercury oxidation should be ﬁrst investigated. 
Moreover, the kinetic parameters of the reactions and the thermo- 
chemical properties of involved species should be provided.

are  based  on  density  functional  theory  (DFT)  [325–333] .  On  the 
basis of the mechanistic studies, the heterogeneous kinetic model 
has been developed to quantitatively describe mercury oxidation 
on Fe 

3 surface [220–224] .

Mercury oxidation by HCl on Fe

Deacon process [279] or the Eley-Rideal mechanism [221] . In the

Deacon process, molecular chlorine (Cl 
alytic oxidation of HCl and reacts with gaseous Hg 0 . However, mer- 
cury oxidation through the Deacon process is not likely to happen 
[20] , because the gas-phase reaction between Hg 0 and Cl 
2 is very 
slow. Therefore, the Eley-Rideal mechanism is mainly responsible 
for Hg 0 oxidation by HCl on Fe 
3 surface [221] . In the Eley-Rideal 
2 O 
mechanism,  gas-phase  Hg 0  reacts  with  the  adsorbed  Cl  species 
produced from HCl dissociation on Fe 
3 surface. The Eley-Rideal 
mechanism can be further conﬁrmed by the pretreatment experi- 
ments [221] and Mössbauer spectroscopy study [321] . 

Although the Eley-Rideal mechanism has been known for Hg 0 
oxidation  by  HCl  on  Fe 
3  surface,  it  is  diﬃcult  to  get  the  im- 
portant  kinetic  information  (such  as  elementary  reactions  and 
rate constants) from experimental works. The elementary reactions 
and  activation  energy  barriers  can  be  supplemented  by  density 
functional  theory  calculations  [ 325–327 , 329 ].  The  adsorption  en- 
ergy  of  Hg 0  on  Fe 
3 (001)  surface  ranges  from  −17.10 kJ/mol  to 
−46.46 kJ/mol [ 325 , 329 , 334 ]. The physical adsorption mechanism is 
associated with Hg 0 adsorption on Fe 
3 (001) surface. HCl decom- 
3 surface [327] , generating active chlorine species for 
poses on Fe 
Hg 0 oxidation. Hg 0 is ﬁrst oxidized by the adsorbed Cl atoms into 
HgCl, which is subsequently oxidized into HgCl 
2 . The energy barri- 
ers of the oxidation steps are 139.47 kJ/mol and 81.76 kJ/mol.

Since the difference of halogens (such as HCl and HBr) and sur-

active  bromine  species  to  form  gaseous  HgBr 
action channels (four-step and three-step processes) are responsi- 
ble for Hg 0  oxidation by HBr on Fe

with the three-step process with higher energy barrier, the four- 
step process (Hg 0 → Hg(s) → HgBr(s) → HgBr

more kinetically and thermodynamically favorable. The third step

Based on the available mechanistic studies and kinetic informa- 
tion, the heterogeneous kinetic model can be developed to predict 
mercury  oxidation  over  Fe 
3 .  For  example,  the  development  of 
heterogeneous  Hg/Cl  reaction  model  is  based  on  the  Eley-Rideal 
mechanism  [221] .  The  heterogeneous  Hg/Cl  reaction  subset  in- 
cludes  eleven  elementary  reactions  (see  Table  S4),  and  provides 
another channel for Hg 0 oxidation over ﬂy ash. This reaction sub- 
set involves the competitive adsorption among HCl, SO x and H 
2 O 
3 surface. This kinetic model is able to reasonably predict 
on Fe 
mercury oxidation in the ﬂow reactor [ 227 , 280 ] and ﬁxed-bed re- 
actor [221] . The HCl concentration and Fe 
3 particle loading de- 
pendences  can  be  reproduced  over  the  wide  temperature  range, 
but the improvements in quantitative agreement are needed.

ments  were  performed  in  a  ﬁxed-bed  reactor.  Nevertheless,  fur- 
ther assessment of this kinetic model needs to be performed us- 
ing more experimental data. Mercury oxidation eﬃciency initially 
increases to a maximum value and subsequently decreases as the 
reaction temperature increases. This trend is associated with the 
temperature-dependent reaction chemistry [224] . 

2 O 

Mercury  oxidation  process  over  Fe 

3  in  the  presence  of 
HBr  is  governed  by  a  delicate  interplay  of  elementary  reac- 
tions. Mercury oxidation is strongly promoted by the adsorption 
reaction  Hg 0 + Fe(s) → Hg(s)  and  the  chain  propagating  reaction 
Hg(s) + Br(s) → HgBr(s) + Fe(s),  as  shown  in  Fig.  11 (a).  The  disso- 
ciation  reaction  of  HBr  on  Fe 
3  surface  also  signiﬁcantly  pro- 
2 O 
motes mercury oxidation, because the surface coverage of active 
bromine atoms is controlled by this reaction. The desorption reac- 
tion Hg(s) → Hg 0 + Fe(s) inhibits mercury oxidation. 

The variation of mercury oxidation eﬃciency as a function of 
reaction temperature is the results of thermodynamic and kinetic 
effects. The temperature-dependent relationship between mercury 
oxidation and heterogeneous reaction chemistry can be quantita- 
tively  described  by  a  dimensionless  temperature  coeﬃcient  ( ψ ) 
[ 224 , 337 ]. The temperature coeﬃcient denotes the total contribu- 
tion  of  the  sensitive  elementary  reactions  to  mercury  oxidation. 
The sensitive reactions are divided into two groups: promotional 
reactions  (mechanism  M1)  and  inhibitory  reactions  (mechanism 
M2). The temperature coeﬃcient can also represent the contribu- 
tion of mechanism M1 and mechanism M2 to mercury oxidation. 
Based on the temperature coeﬃcient deﬁnition, the temperature 
3 surface can be 
dependence of mercury oxidation by HBr on Fe 
well explained, as shown in Fig. 11 (b). At the lower temperatures 
(100–150 °C), ψ  ≥ 0, the promotional effect of mechanism M1 is 
much stronger than the inhibitory effect of mechanism M2, mer- 
cury oxidation eﬃciency increases with increasing reaction tem- 
perature.  At  the  higher  temperatures  (20 0–50 0  °C),  ψ  <  0,  the 
promotional effect of mechanism M1 is much weaker than the in- 
hibitory effect of mechanism M2, the increase in reaction temper- 
ature inhibits mercury oxidation.

Although both bromine and chlorine are the halogen species,

nism controlling mercury oxidation over CuO is mainly based on 
the density functional theory calculations [340–342] . 

Hg 0  adsorption on different CuO surfaces (including CuO(110) 
and  CuO(111))  is  controlled  by  different  mechanisms.  CuO(110) 
is  a  low-index  surface  of  CuO  particle.  Different  terminations 
of  CuO(110)  surface  show  different  reactivity  for  Hg 0  adsorp- 
tion. Cu-terminated CuO(110) surface is much more favorable for 
Hg 0 adsorption than O-terminated CuO(110) surface [340] . Hg 0 is 
strongly and chemically adsorbed on Cu-terminated CuO(110) sur- 
face, yielding an adsorption energy of −116.76 kJ/mol. The stronger 
interaction  between  Hg 0  and  CuO(110)  surface  is  closely  associ- 
ated with the signiﬁcant overlap between Hg d-orbital and Cu s- 
orbital. Cu atoms are the active sites of Hg 0 adsorption on CuO sur- 
face. Doping the lower electropositive element can signiﬁcantly en- 
hance the Hg 0 adsorption capacity of O-terminated CuO(110) sur- 
face [342] . 

CuO(111) is a thermodynamically stable surface. The adsorption 
energy of Hg 0  on CuO(111) surface is about −27.40 kJ/mol, which 
is much lower than that of Hg 0  adsorption on CuO(110) surface. 
The  physisorption  mechanism  is  responsible  for  Hg 0  adsorption 
on CuO(111) surface [341] . However, Hg 0  adsorption on CuO(110) 
surface is controlled by the chemisorption mechanism [340] . HCl 
2 are chemically adsorbed on CuO(111) surface. The energy 
and Cl 
barriers of Hg 0 oxidation by HCl and Cl 
2 on CuO(111) surface are 
2.57 kJ/mol and 14.44 kJ/mol, respectively. 

6. Mechanism of Hg oxidation over SCR catalysts 

Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of nitrogen oxides (NO x ) with 
ammonia is widely used in coal-ﬁred power plants for the con- 
trol of NO x emissions. A co-beneﬁt of SCR system is that SCR cat- 
alysts  can  promote  the  oxidation  of  Hg 0  to  Hg 2 +  [343] .  Accord- 
ingly, catalytic oxidation of Hg 0 to Hg 2 + , followed by the removal 
of  Hg 2 +  in  wet  ﬂue  gas  desulfurization  (WFGD)  units,  is  iden- 
tiﬁed  as  the  most  convenient  and  economical  method  for  mer- 
cury  abatement  [20] .  Up  to  now,  studies  on  Hg 0  oxidation  over 
SCR catalysts mainly focus on V 
5 -based [344–347] , MnO x -based 
2 O 
[348–350] ,  and  CeO 
2 -based  [351–353]  materials.  Several  mecha- 
nisms, including the Deacon process, the Eley-Rideal (E-R) mecha- 
nism, the Langmuir-Hinshelwood (L-H) mechanism, and the Mars- 
Maessen (M-M) mechanism, have been proposed for Hg 0 oxidation 
over SCR catalysts [20] . However, none of the above mechanisms is 
deﬁnitive for Hg 0 catalytic oxidation, and the reaction mechanism 
depends on the types of catalysts [20] . A brief update on the ox- 
idation mechanism of Hg 0  over SCR catalysts is included here to 
outline the main results.

Hg 0 oxidation by HCl over SCR catalysts is normally deﬁned as the 
equation  Hg 0 + 2HCl + 1/2O 
2 = HgCl

The Deacon process, where HCl is ﬁrstly oxidized by SCR cat- 
alysts to produce Cl 
2 via ho- 
mogeneous reaction, has been suggested to be responsible for Hg 0 
oxidation [370] . However, negligible Hg 0 can be oxidized to Hg 2 + 
when  Hg 0  is  added  into  the  HCl + O 
2  gas  stream  at  the  down- 
stream of SCR catalysts [357] . In addition, the oxidation of HCl to 
Cl 
2 is kinetically limited [109] , the equilibrium concentration of Cl 
2 
is only about 1% of the HCl concentration. Furthermore, the gas- 
phase reaction between Hg 0 and Cl 
2 plays an insigniﬁcant role in 
mercury oxidation process [ 161 , 201 ]. Therefore, the Deacon process 
is not responsible for Hg 0 oxidation over SCR catalysts [357] . 

Langmuir-Hinshelwood and Eley-Rideal mechanisms are widely 
used to interpret the heterogeneous Hg 0 oxidation by HCl over SCR 
catalysts.  In  the  case  of  Langmuir-Hinshelwood  mechanism,  two 
reactants (Hg 0  and HCl) are adsorbed on catalyst surface and re- 
act to form HgCl 
2 [ 355 , 357 , 371 ]. There are two types of Eley-Rideal 
mechanism for Hg 0 oxidation: (1) HCl is ﬁrstly dissociated on the 
catalyst surface to form active chlorine complexes, and then reacts 
with gaseous (or weakly adsorbed) Hg 0 [ 344 , 345 , 354 , 372 ]. (2) Hg 0 
is ﬁrstly adsorbed on the catalyst surface to form the adsorbed Hg 0 
and then reacts with gaseous HCl [346] . The oxidation mechanism 
is closely related to the adsorption characteristics of Hg 0 and HCl 
on SCR catalyst surface.

creases with increasing reaction temperature from 150 to 350 °C 
[371] ,  because  the  higher  reaction  temperature  is  not  beneﬁcial 
for Hg 0  adsorption. This indicates that gaseous Hg 0  is ﬁrstly ad- 
sorbed  on  catalyst  surface  and  then  takes  part  in  Hg 0  oxidation 
reaction. However, it should be noted that the extent of adsorbed 
Hg 0 on V 
5 -based SCR catalysts is very low and the presence of 
HCl can further inhibit Hg 0 adsorption [ 354 , 372 ]. In addition, the 
5 -based catalysts is much more intensive 
adsorption of HCl on V

than that of Hg 0 [357] . The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) 
[ 355 , 364 , 371 ]  and  Fourier  transform  infrared  spectroscopy  (FTIR) 
[357]  data  provide  substantial  evidence  for  the  formation  of  ac- 
tive chlorine species on SCR catalyst surface. The active chlorine 
species then react with gaseous Hg 0 , which is consistent with the 
Eley-Rideal mechanism. 

The  Mars-Maessen  mechanism  is  responsible  for  Hg 0  oxida- 
5 -based SCR catalysts in the absence of acid gases 
tion over V 
[ 360 , 364 , 373 ].  The  adsorbed  Hg 0  reacts  with  lattice  oxygen  of 
catalysts  to  form  oxidized  mercury.  Oxygen  vacancy  is  produced 
during  oxidized  mercury  desorption,  and  then  replenished  by 
gaseous  oxygen  molecules.  The  Mars-Maessen  mechanism  can 
be  conﬁrmed  by  the  observation  of  Hg 0  oxidation  without  the 
aid  of  acid  gases  and  the  surface  analysis  of  the  used  cata- 
lysts.  For  example,  adsorbed  Hg 0  can  be  oxidized  to  HgO  over 
V 
2  atmo- 
2 O 
sphere  [ 360 , 364 , 374 ].  Meanwhile,  HgO  species  adsorbed  on  the 
used catalysts can be found by XPS and temperature-programmed 
desorption (TPD) analyses. Mo 6 + addition in V 
2 catalyst can 
promote  the  reoxidation  of  V 3 +  to  V 5 +  and  further  increase  the 
number of active oxygen for Hg 0 oxidation [ 364 , 374 ]. In the typical 
SCR atmosphere, however, the ﬁrst step of Mars-Maessen mech- 
anism  (i.e.,  Hg 0  adsorption)  may  be  markedly  inhibited  by  NH 
3 
and HCl, thereby hindering the Hg 0  oxidation through the Mars- 
Maessen mechanism.

6.1.2. Quantum chemistry calculations 

Elucidating the heterogeneous reaction mechanism of Hg 0  ad- 
sorption  and  oxidation  is  crucial  to  the  design  of  catalysts  with 
good  catalytic  properties.  It  is  diﬃcult  to  understand  the  mech- 
anistic nature of mercury oxidation on catalyst surface by exper- 
iments.  Quantum  chemistry  calculations  based  on  density  func- 
tional theory (DFT) can build an entire atomic-scale mechanistic 
picture  [ 313 , 375 , 376 ].  Recent  progress  in  DFT  makes  it  a  power- 
ful  tool  to  accurately  describe  heterogeneous  reactions  on  cata- 
lyst surface and to comprehend the difference in catalytic activity 
from one catalyst to another. The reaction states which maybe not 
accessible to experimental methods, e.g., the electronic structure 
of transitory reaction intermediates and activated complexes, can 
be identiﬁed using DFT calculations [377] . DFT method has been 
widely used to investigate the mechanisms of mercury adsorption 
and  oxidation  on  various  sorbent/catalyst  surfaces,  such  as  acti- 
vated carbon [ 19 , 270–272 , 274 , 275 , 295 , 378 , 379 ], metals [380–384] , 
metal oxides [ 340 , 385–402 ], and metal sulﬁdes [403–407] . In this 
section, we describe a series of theoretical studies involved in the 
reaction mechanism of Hg 0 oxidation over V 

5 -based catalysts. 

There is still controversy on the mechanism of Hg 0  oxidation 
over V 
5 -based catalysts, as discussed in Section 6.1.1 . The key 
problem lies in the accurate understanding of Hg 0 adsorption and 
oxidation over V 
5 -based catalysts. DFT method combined with 
the periodic slab model can provide an atomic-level understanding 
of Hg 0 adsorption and oxidation. It is critical to construct a suitable 
catalyst model for investigating the catalytic reaction process. V 
2 O 
5 
is the active component of commercial SCR catalysts, and is gener- 
ally supported on TiO 
2 . The strong interaction between active com- 
ponent and support plays an important role in catalytic reaction 
2 (001)  model  developed  by  Wilcox  and  cowork- 
[312] .  V 
2 O 
ers [ 398 , 408 ] can well represent the molecular structure of V 
5 - 
based catalysts. The adsorption energy of Hg 0  on V 
5 /TiO 
2 (001) 
surface is much lower than that of Hg 0 on V 
5 (001) surface. The 
surface composition and coverage show signiﬁcant effects on the 
reactivity  of  catalysts  toward  Hg 0  oxidation.  The  ternary  system 
2 ) is more reactive for Hg 0 oxidation than the bi- 
(V 
nary systems (i.e., V 
2 ) [397] , because the ad-

ity of catalyst increases with increasing the active phase loading. 
The observed increase in the activity is not related to the increase 
of available active sites, but is caused by the change in the struc- 
ture and coordination of active sites.

Identifying the intermediates (IMs), transition states (TSs), rate- 
limiting steps and activation energy barriers of elementary reac- 
tion steps is very important for understanding the catalytic reac- 
tion mechanism of Hg 0  oxidation over SCR catalysts. There have 
been efforts to get these important information for Hg 0 oxidation 
by HCl and HBr on V 
2 (001) surface [ 393 , 396 ]. HCl disso- 
ciation over V 
5 -based catalysts produces active chlorine species 
(Cl–V 5 + ) for Hg 0  oxidation [357] . HCl dissociation needs to over- 
come an energy barrier of 101.53 kJ/mol  [396] (see Fig. 12 ). Hg 0 
oxidation by HCl on V 
2 (001) surface follows the Eley-Rideal 
mechanism  and  goes  through  three  steps:  (1)  Hg 0 + HCl → HgCl, 
(2)  HgCl + HCl → HgCl 
2  desorption.  The  second 
step  presents  the  highest  energy  barrier  (91.53 kJ/mol),  and  is 
the rate-limiting step of Hg 0  oxidation. Hg 0  oxidation by HBr on 
V 
2 (001) surface is similar to that by HCl. The dissociation 
2 O 
energy barrier of HBr (85.59 kJ/mol) is lower than that of HCl, and 
the energy barrier of the rate-limiting step for Hg 0  oxidation by 
HBr (66.97 kJ/mol) is also lower than that of Hg 0 oxidation by HCl. 
These  can  provide  a  molecular-level  explanation  for  the  experi- 
mental observations [ 254 , 255 , 343 ] that HBr is much more effective 
than HCl in promoting Hg 0 oxidation.

The modiﬁcation of V 

5 -based catalysts by transition metals 
can broaden the temperature window of Hg 0 oxidation [ 394 , 399 ]. 
The  higher  temperature  is  beneﬁcial  for  Hg 0  oxidation  over  the 
undoped V 
2 catalyst due to the higher energy barrier and 
positive  reaction  energy,  while  the  lower  temperature  is  beneﬁ- 
cial for Hg 0 oxidation over the Fe-doped catalyst due to the lower 
energy barrier and negative reaction energy. Meanwhile, Fe dop- 
ing can also enhance the oxidation ability of catalyst towards Hg 0 
oxidation, because the substitution of V with Fe leads to the for- 
mation of oxygen ions (O –) with strong oxidizability. However, it 
should be noted that the main function of SCR catalyst is NO x re- 
duction. Accordingly, the modiﬁcation of SCR catalyst to enhance 
Hg 0 oxidation should not obstruct NO x reduction. 

6.1.3. Numerical simulation 

In the monolith honeycomb reactor or plate reactor, mercury 
oxidation by HCl is affected by many factors (such as temperature, 
space velocity, catalyst conﬁguration, NH 
3 /NO ratio, and HCl con- 
centration).  The  mathematical  models  that  have  been  developed 
to describe the apparent mercury oxidation process in SCR hon- 
eycomb  reactors  include  the  gas-solid  mass  transfer,  intraporous 
diffusion, and global reaction scheme. A lumped approach is usu- 
ally used to describe mass transfer process. Different mathemat- 
ical  models  have  been  developed  to  describe  mercury  oxidation 
in monolith honeycomb reactor [ 344 , 346 , 409–412 ] or packed-bed 
reactor [ 372 , 374 , 413–415 ]. As the ﬂue gas stream moves through 
the honeycomb channel of SCR reactor, Hg 0 concentration change 
caused by the gas-solid mass transfer can be expressed as [409–
412] :

with increasing HCl concentration. Moreover, the effects of reaction 
temperature on mercury oxidation depend on HCl concentration. 

In the packed-bed reactor, the effects of mass transfer on mer- 
cury oxidation are usually neglected due to the larger gas hourly 
space velocity (GHSV). Only the global reaction scheme is consid- 
ered in the mathematical model. The reaction rate of mercury ox- 
idation in a packed-bed reactor can be expressed as a function of 
the differential mass of catalyst [ 372 , 414 ]:

[ 389 , 393 , 396–398 , 401 ] have demonstrated that Hg 0 oxidation over

An example of numerical simulation for mercury oxidation in 
the monolith honeycomb reactor is shown in Fig. 13 (a) [412] . At 
the  low  temperatures  below  300 °C,  Hg 0  oxidation  is  insensitive 
to  HCl  concentration  variations.  Mercury  oxidation  eﬃciency  in- 
creases slightly with increasing HCl concentration from 2.5 ppmv 
to 50 ppmv. HCl adsorption on catalyst surface reaches a satura- 
tion state, and all vanadium active sites that participate in mer- 
cury oxidation reaction are chlorinated. Therefore, Hg 0 oxidation is 
kinetically limited at the lower temperatures. At the high temper- 
atures above 300 °C, Hg 0 oxidation is sensitive to HCl concentra- 
tion variations. Mercury oxidation eﬃciency increases signiﬁcantly

2  concentration, whereas Hg 0  oxidation is ﬁrst-order 
respect to O 
with respect to Hg 0 concentration [ 372 , 374 , 414 ]. Hg 0 oxidation rate 
can be expressed as a power-law form: 
r Hg = −k Hg C in

Under the given conditions ( F in

the slopes of the plots of –ln(1 −η) vs W/ F in 
Hg . As an example taken 
from Ref. [372] , Fig. 13 (b) shows the relationship between catalyst 
mass and mercury oxidation eﬃciency at different reaction tem- 
peratures.  Mercury  oxidation  eﬃciency  increases  with  increasing 
catalyst mass. The reaction rate constant of Hg 0 oxidation increases

5 -based commercial SCR catalysts are active within a nar- 
row temperature window of 30 0–40 0 °C. This means that SCR unit 
must be installed upstream of ESP/FF and WFGD where the cat- 
alyst is exposed to high concentration of dust and SO 
2 , resulting 
in a decreased service life. Thus, it is essential to develop novel 
SCR catalysts with high activity at low temperatures (100–250 °C). 
The SCR unit with the novel catalyst can be located downstream 
of  ESP/FF,  where  the  ﬂue  gas  is  relatively  clean  and  then  cata- 
lyst deactivation is weakened. To date, many SCR catalysts contain- 
ing transition metals (Mn, Ce, Fe, Cr, Cu, and Co) have been re- 
ported to have good activity in the low-temperature SCR of NO x 
[416–419] . Among them, MnO x -based catalysts have exhibited ex- 
cellent low-temperature SCR activity. Meanwhile, the high catalytic 
activity, easy manufacturing and low cost of MnO x -based catalysts 
make it to be one of the best candidates for Hg 0 oxidation. 

6.2.1. Experimental studies 

There are various MnO x -based catalysts to catalyze Hg 0 oxida- 
tion [ 348 , 349 , 420–437 ]. These catalysts can be divided into three 
types: unsupported Mn-based oxides (X-MnO x ), supported single 
manganese oxides (MnO x /support) and supported composite man- 
ganese oxides (MnO x −MO y /support). The reaction mechanism, ox- 
idation  eﬃciency  and  reaction  condition  of  Hg 0  oxidation  over 
MnO x -based catalysts are summarized in Table 7 .

Carbon-based materials, such as graphene, carbon sphere (CS),

carbon-based  materials  are  often  used  as  catalyst  supports,  be- 
cause they can prevent MnO x particle aggregation and enhance the 
electrical conductivity which is beneﬁcial for Hg 0 catalytic oxida- 
tion [429] . Moreover, the porous structure of carbon-based materi- 
als makes the formation of surface sulfate species diﬃcult. For ex- 
ample, MnO

sulfur resistance for Hg 0 removal [445] . Nevertheless, the mechan-

meet the requirement of practical application.

The doping of lanthanides (such as Ce) [ 435 , 4 47–4 49 ] and tran- 
sition metals (such as Cu, Fe, Co and Mo) [ 348 , 432–434 ] can im- 
prove the catalytic properties of MnO x /support catalysts. The in- 
creased catalytic activity may be attributed to the synergetic ef- 
fects  between  Mn  and  dopants  [448] ,  because  the  presence  of 
dopants  can  enhance  the  proportion  of  Mn 4 +  [432]  or  increase 
the oxygen storage capacity and redox activity [433] . Moreover, el-

6.2.1.4. Hg 0 oxidation mechanism.  Hg 0 oxidation over MnO x -based 
catalysts  mainly  follows  the  Langmuir-Hinshelwood  or  Mars- 
Maessen mechanism, as shown in Table 7 . The speciﬁc mechanism 
is  determined  by  the  ﬂue  gas  components,  i.e.,  with  or  without 
HCl. The methods of mechanism acquirement mainly include HCl- 
pretreatment experiments [424] and XPS characterization analysis 
[423] . 

HCl  is  the  most  reactive  species  in  terms  of  heterogeneous 
Hg 0  oxidation.  In  the  presence  of  HCl,  Langmuir-Hinshelwood 
mechanism is generally used to interpret Hg 0  catalytic oxidation 
over MnO x -based catalysts [ 349 , 423 , 428 , 431 , 432 , 435–437 ]. The ad-

low-rank  coal-ﬁred  ﬂue  gas  with  low  content  of  HCl  or  with- 
out  HCl.  In  the  absence  of  HCl,  Hg 0  oxidation  over  MnO x - 
based  catalysts  generally  occurs  through  Mars-Maessen  mecha- 
nism  [ 420 , 421 , 425 , 429 , 433 , 434 ].  Hg 0  is  oxidized  by  chemisorbed 
oxygen  or  lattice  oxygen  into  HgO  species.  The  participation  of 
chemisorbed  oxygen  and  lattice  oxygen  can  be  conﬁrmed  by 
XPS analysis results [ 425 , 427 , 429 , 431 , 433 ]. However, HgO desorp- 
tion  from  MnO x -based  catalysts  is  diﬃcult  at  low  temperatures 
(T < 250 °C), which leads to HgO deposition on the catalyst sur- 
face after a long-term reaction process.

2  molecule  can  be  dissociated  into  atomic  oxygen  for  Hg 0  ox- 
O 
idation.  Different  oxygen  species  show  different  reaction  activity 
for  Hg 0  oxidation.  The  perpendicularly  adsorbed  O 
2  molecule  is 
the  most  active  oxygen  for  Hg 0  oxidation  due  to  the  lower  en- 
ergy barrier [388] . Hg 0  oxidation by O 
2  includes three steps: (1) 
Hg 0 → Hg(ads),  (2)  Hg(ads) → HgO(ads)  and  (3)  HgO(ads) → HgO. 
HgO  desorption  is  the  rate-limiting  step  of  Hg 0  oxidation.  Com- 
pared with the mercury-oxygen reaction, the mercury-chlorine re- 
action is much more favorable for Hg 0 oxidation.

The interaction between gaseous species (reactants and prod- 
ucts) and catalyst surface plays an important role in Hg 0  oxida- 
2 -based catalysts. The adsorption process of different 
tion over MnO 
2 (110) surface is controlled by chemisorp- 
mercury species on MnO 
tion [ 388 , 450 ]. The strong interaction between Hg 0 and MnO 
2 (110) 
surface  is  closely  associated  with  the  orbital  hybridization  be- 
br atoms. In the presence of HCl, HCl decomposes 
tween Hg and O 
2  surface  to  form  active  chlorine  species  for  Hg 0  oxida- 
on  MnO 
tion [386] . Hg 0  oxidation on MnO 
2  surface may be controlled by 
two reaction pathways (Hg 0 → HgCl 
2 and Hg 0 → HgCl → HgCl 
2 ), as 
shown  in  Fig.  15 .  Since  the  two-step  reaction  pathway  presents 
a relatively lower energy barrier, Hg 0  oxidation by HCl on MnO 
2 
surface tends to Hg 0 → HgCl → HgCl 
2 . The 
rate-limiting step of Hg 0 oxidation via the two-step reaction path- 
way is the HgCl → HgCl 

2 rather than Hg 0 → HgCl 

In the absence of HCl, Hg 0 can be catalytically oxidized by oxy- 
2 , chemisorbed oxygen, and lattice oxy- 

gen species (gas-phase O

The global reaction kinetics can be used to identify the mer- 
cury oxidation mechanism (Eley-Rideal or Langmuir-Hinshelwood) 
on  catalyst  surface  through  comparing  their  contributions  to 
Hg 0  consumption.  It  is  assumed  that  both  Eley-Rideal  and 
Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanisms are responsible for Hg 0 oxida-

state. Moreover, the surface coverage of adsorbed Hg 0 is also con- 
sidered as a constant when the catalytic reaction system reaches

the  global  reaction  rate  and  Hg 0  concentration.  The  Eley–Rideal 
and Langmuir–Hinshelwood rate constants can be obtained from 
the  slops  and  intercepts  of  the  plots  of  r

For example, the rate constants of Hg 0  oxidation over Fe–Ti–Mn

The Eley–Rideal rate constant is much higher than the Langmuir–

Hg 0 oxidation mechanism over unsupported Ce-based oxides is 
closely associated with HCl. It is widely accepted that HCl plays 
a  key  role  in  Hg 0  oxidation.  However,  the  existence  of  HCl  also 
inhibits Hg 0  removal due to the competitive adsorption between 
Hg 0 and HCl [ 459 , 468 ]. Moreover, HCl might inhibit NO reduction 
by forming metal chlorides over SCR catalyst [ 475 , 476 ]. The effect 
of HCl on Hg 0 oxidation and NO reduction is related to the acid- 
base  properties  of  catalyst  surface.  For  example,  compared  with 
VMo/Ti catalyst, CeMoO x catalyst with medium-strength basic sites 

3 poisoning during NO reduc- 
shows good resistance to HCl and NH 
tion and Hg 0 oxidation [460] , as shown in Fig. 16 (a) and (b). The 
acid sites are responsible for Hg 0  adsorption. Obviously, SCR cat- 
alyst can be divided into two distinct zones: SCR zone and Hg 0 
oxi 
zone (see Fig. 16 (c)).

gle and composite cerium oxides is controlled by different mech- 
anisms. The difference in mercury oxidation mechanism is caused 
by the elements doping. For example, Hg 0  oxidation by HCl over 
CeO

mechanism [ 351 , 464 ], whereas the Eley-Rideal mechanism is re-

6.3.2. Quantum chemistry calculations 

Although  the  aforementioned  overall  reaction  mechanisms 
(Langmuir-Hinshelwood and Eley-Rideal) are speculated on the ba- 
sis of experimental observations, the elementary reaction pathways 
and kinetic parameters of Hg 0 oxidation over CeO 
2 -based catalysts 
cannot be obtained from experiments. In order to provide insights 
into the molecular-level reaction mechanism, DFT calculations have 
been performed to examine the transition states and energy pro- 
ﬁles of Hg 0 oxidation over CeO 

2 -based catalysts [478–483] . 

In the presence of HCl, the chlorinated CeO 

2 surface can stably 
exist in coal-ﬁred ﬂue gas [478] . Hg 0 adsorption on CeO 
2 (111) sur- 
face is controlled by the physisorption mechanism. The chemisorp- 
tion  mechanism  is  responsible  for  HCl  adsorption  on  CeO 
2 (111) 
surface. The weak interaction between Hg 0 and CeO 
2 catalyst sur- 
face can be conﬁrmed by XPS analysis [484] . Obviously, Hg 0 oxida- 
tion by HCl over CeO 
2 catalyst follows the Eley-Rideal mechanism 
[478] . This is consistent with experimental results [352] . The dom- 
inant reaction pathway of Hg 0 oxidation by HCl over CeO 
2 catalyst 
is a two-step process (Hg 0 → HgCl → HgCl 
2 ), as shown in Fig. 17 . 
2  process is the rate-limiting step of Hg 0  oxida-

tion due to its relatively higher energy barrier. In the absence of 
HCl, surface oxygen species play an important role in Hg 0 oxidation 
over Ce-based catalysts. The Mars-Maessen mechanism is respon-

though the energy barrier of HgO formation (20.70 kJ/mol) is lower 
than that of HgCl

( −163.81 kJ/mol) of HgO is much higher than that ( −46.55 kJ/mol)

and thus slow the overall catalytic reaction [ 4 85 , 4 86 ].

6.3.3. Numerical simulation 

The  mathematical  model  of  Hg 0  oxidation  in  the  packed-bed 
reactor has been discussed in the Section 6.1.3 . Nevertheless, the 

effect of mass transfer on Hg 0 oxidation is neglected in the math- 
ematical model. In order to further investigate the effect of mass 
transfer on Hg 0 oxidation in the packed-bed reactor, the gas-solid 
external mass transfer has been incorporated into the mathemat- 
ical model and used to investigate the apparent reaction kinetics 
of Hg 0 oxidation by HCl over CeO 
2 catalyst [487] . The global 
reaction rate only involves the role of HCl in mercury oxidation, 
and omits the competitive adsorption among other ﬂue gas species

7. Mechanism of Hg oxidation over noble metal catalysts 

2  and H 

Noble  metals  (such  as  Au,  Pd  and  Ru)  are  highly  active  to- 
wards Hg 0  oxidation, and usually show good SO 
2 O resis- 
tance [4 88–4 92] . Noble metal catalysts are generally placed down- 
stream of ESP/FF [ 20 , 4 88 , 4 93–4 95 ], where the temperature of ﬂue 
gas is low. The high cost of noble metals may not inhibit their ap- 
plication in Hg 0 oxidation due to their low mass loading, high ox- 
idation activity, durable and regenerable properties [20] . This sec- 
tion focuses on Hg 0  oxidation over the widely used noble metal 
catalysts (Au, Pd, Pt, Ru and Ag). The catalytic performance and re- 
action mechanism of these catalysts are discussed below. The ad- 
sorption energy and reaction mechanism of Hg 0 over noble metal 
catalysts are given in Table 9 . 

7.1. Au-based catalysts 

7.1.1. Experimental studies 

Au is regarded as a potential catalyst for Hg 0 oxidation because 
of its ability to adsorb Hg 0 and its reluctance to adsorb other ﬂue 
2 ), and widely tested by 
gas compositions (such as NO, H 
laboratory-, pilot- and full-scale experiments [ 4 88–4 90 , 4 93–4 95 ]. 

2 O, and SO 

2  and HCl) are the most important reactants 
Chlorine species (Cl 
for the oxidation of adsorbed Hg 0 over Au-based catalysts. Active 
Cl atoms can be produced from the dissociation of Cl 
2 or HCl on 
Au  surface  [511] ,  and  react  with  the  adsorbed  Hg 0 .  Clearly,  Hg 0 
oxidation by chlorine species over Au-based catalysts follows the 
Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism [ 4 89 , 4 93 ]. 

In order to further evaluate the catalytic activity and long-term 
stability of Au catalysts, the pilot- and full-scale tests are impor- 
tant for its practical application. For example, Hg 0  oxidation eﬃ- 
ciency of the Au catalysts equipped at Fayette Power Project Unit 3 
decreases from 80% to 77% after 6 months of operation and fur- 
ther  declines  to  57%  after  17  months  [495] .  The  loss  of  activity 
is attributed to the build-up of ﬂy ash in the measured catalysts 
2 poisoning. During Hg 0 oxidation, Au catalysts 
rather than the SO 
can preclude any inhibitory effects of NO, H 

2 O and SO 

2 . 

7.1.2. Quantum chemistry calculations 

Au has a strong ability to bind gas-phase Hg 0  [ 489 , 512 ]. This 
inherent property is closely associated with the mechanism of the 
interaction between gaseous Hg 0  and Au surface. The atomic or- 
bital hybridization between Hg d-state and Au d-state is respon- 
sible  for  the  strong  Hg 0  adsorption  ability  of  Au  catalyst  [496] . 
Hg 0 adsorption on Au surface is affected by some factors, includ- 
ing vacancy, impurity atoms, and Au cluster charge. For example, 
the adsorption strength of Hg 0  on Au(111) surface increases with 
increasing  the  number  of  vacancies  from  0  to  3,  but  decreases 
with further increasing the vacancies [496] . The increased adsorp- 
tion strength of Hg 0  on the defective Au(111) surface with 3 va- 
cancies is attributed to the upward shift of the d-band center to 
Fermi level. The presence of S or O impurity atom weakens the in- 
teraction between Hg 0 and Au surface [496] , because the impurity 
atoms induce Au surface reconstruction to produce more under- 
coordinated Au sites [513] . Compared with the neutral and anionic 
Au n clusters, the cationic Au n clusters are more favorable for Hg 0 
adsorption [514] . 

The reaction pathways and activation energy barriers are im- 
portant for understanding the reaction mechanism of Hg 0  oxida- 
tion over Au catalyst. Hg 0 oxidation by chlorine species on Au(111) 
surfaces prefers the two-step process (Hg 0 → HgCl → HgCl 
2 ), rather 
than the one-step process (Hg 0 → HgCl 
2 formation is 

2 ) [497] . HgCl 

28 

Y. Yang, J. Liu and Z. Wang / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 79 (2020) 100844 

the rate-limiting step of the whole Hg 0  oxidation reaction. Since 
the adsorption strength of reaction intermediates on defective Au 
surface is much stronger than that on perfect Au surface, the de- 
fective Au surface is unfavorable for Hg 0 oxidation. Moreover, the 
presence of H atoms derived from HCl dissociation facilities Hg 0 
oxidation on Au surface, because it can weaken the interaction be- 
tween reaction intermediates and Au surface. 

7.2. Pd-based catalysts 

7.2.1. Experimental studies 

As with Au, Pd also has a strong ability for Hg 0 adsorption even 
at temperatures as high as 388 °C [515] . The adsorbed Hg 0 can be 
effectively oxidized over Pd-based catalysts in the presence of HCl 
or Cl 
2 . This phenomenon has been demonstrated by bench-scale 
[ 4 88 , 4 92 ], pilot-scale [4 90] , and full-scale [ 4 94 , 4 95 ] experiments. 
Hg 0 oxidation depends on the presence of chlorine species. For ex- 
ample, the reaction rate of Hg 0 oxidation over Pd catalyst increases 
with  increasing  HCl  concentration  from  50  ppmv  to  100  ppmv 
[488] . Hg 0  oxidation continues when HCl is cut off, but the oxi- 
dation rate declines. The continued oxidation is attributed to the 
adsorbed chlorine species. 

Pd  catalyst  has  an  excellent  regeneration  performance  during 
its practical application. This property can signiﬁcantly reduce the 
production cost of catalyst. However, the thermal regeneration pro- 
cess should be conducted in the inert atmosphere (such as N 
2 and 
2 ) to avoid the detrimental oxidation of Pd catalyst [494] , be- 
CO 
cause palladium oxides show little catalytic activity for Hg 0 oxida- 
tion. Nevertheless, N 
2 can be easily separated from air for 
the regeneration of the used Pd catalyst. Therefore, Pd is a promis- 
ing catalyst for Hg 0 oxidation due to its high catalytic activity and 
excellent regeneration performance. 

2 and CO 

7.2.2. Quantum chemistry calculations 

The strong interaction between Hg 0  and Pd catalyst is closely 
related to the electronic structure (such as atomic orbital, charge 
transfer,  and  d-band  center)  of  Pd  cluster.  During  Hg 0  adsorp- 
tion, the charges are transferred from Hg s-orbital to Pd d-orbital 
[ 4 98 , 4 99 ]. The adsorption energy of Hg 0  on Pd cluster is directly 
proportional to charge transfer. The adsorption energy of Hg 0  on 
cationic Pd cluster is much higher than that of Hg 0 on neutral and 
anionic clusters. Hg 0 adsorption on cationic Pd cluster highly de- 
pends on the energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals 
of Pd cluster [498] . Moreover, the size of Pd cluster shows a signif- 
icant effect on Hg 0  adsorption [ 500 , 502 , 503 ]. The size-related ef- 
fect is closely associated with the energy level of the d-band cen- 
ter ( ε
d ) [ 501 , 503 ]. The stronger interaction between Hg 0  and Pd 
cluster can be observed if the ε

d is close to the Fermi level. 

The size of catalyst particle is much larger than the size of clus- 
ter. Obviously, Pd cluster cannot accurately represent the Pd cat- 
alyst  surface.  The  periodic  slab  models,  including  Pd(111)  [ 504–
506 , 516 ] and Pd(100) [384] , can be used to well understand the 
adsorption and oxidation mechanisms of Hg 0  on Pd catalyst sur- 
face.  Pd(111)  and  Pd(100)  surfaces  show  similar  reactivity  for 
Hg 0  adsorption,  because  the  adsorption  energy  ( −81.05 kJ/mol) 
[ 501 , 505 ] of Hg 0 on Pd(111) surface is comparable to that ( −55.96 
to  −97.45 kJ/mol)  [384]  of  Hg 0  on  Pd(100)  surface.  The  signiﬁ- 
cant orbital overlap between Pd and Hg atoms is responsible for 
the  stronger  interaction  between  Hg 0  and  Pd  surface  [ 384 , 501 ]. 
HCl  readily  dissociates  into  active  Cl  atoms  for  Hg 0  oxidation. 
Hg 0  oxidation  by  HCl  on  Pd(100)  surface  follows  the  Langmuir- 
Hinshelwood mechanism in which the adsorbed Hg 0  reacts with 
2 molecule [384] . Hg 0 is directly 
the active Cl atoms to form HgCl 
2 . Hg 0  oxidation is ac- 
oxidized by the active Cl atoms into HgCl 
tivated  and  exothermic  by  67.13 kJ/mol  and  92.06 kJ/mol,  respec-

7.3. Pt-based catalysts 

Platinum  (Pt)  receives  considerable  attention  in  the  catalysis 
ﬁeld due to its excellent catalytic properties [517] . Pt can also cat- 
alyze Hg 0 oxidation in coal-ﬁred ﬂue gas [488] . Therefore, exper- 
imental  studies  [ 24 , 120 , 121 , 518–521 ]  and  theoretical  calculations 
[ 380 , 381 ] have focused on Hg 0 adsorption and oxidation over Pt- 
based catalysts.

Hg 0  oxidation  over  Pt-based  catalyst  highly  depends  on  the

reduced reaction rate and ﬁnally stops when HCl concentration de-

to sustain Hg 0  oxidation. The observed oxidized mercury species

Hg 0  can also be adsorbed on Pt surface to form intermetallic 
compounds (such as PtHg 
2 , and PtHg) [518–521] . The pres- 
ence of these intermetallic compounds leads to the great surface 
instability, which is attributed to the atomic size factor of mercury 
and platinum [520] . These intermetallic compounds have different 
thermal stabilities [521] . In the temperature range of 184–271 ºC, 
PtHg 
2  decomposes to form PtHg in 
the temperature range of 271–340 ºC. PtHg eutectoid reaction oc- 
curs  on  the  solid  surface  at  the  temperature  of  340  ºC.  As  the 
temperature further increases, mercury is removed from the Hg-Pt 
solid solution.

The  deposition  chemistry  of  mercury  on  platinum  surface  is 
different  from  the  catalytic  reaction  chemistry,  because  mercury 
deposition on platinum surface is not dependent upon the pres- 
ence  of  HCl.  As  an  example  taken  from  Ref.  [24] ,  Fig.  18  shows 
the  mercury  deposition  on  the  platinum  clad  probe  surface.  In 
the sulfur-containing ﬂue gas system, mercury can eﬃciently de- 
posit as mercuric sulfate (HgSO 
4 ), whereas in the sulfur-free ﬂue 
gas system, mercuric oxide is formed on the platinum clad probe 
surface at 250 ºC. Compared with HgO, HgSO 
4 is more thermally 
stable and forms at the slightly higher temperatures. These mer- 
cury species readily react with HCl to form gas-phase HgCl 
2 on Pt 
surface if chlorine exists in ﬂue gas [ 120 , 121 ]. The conversion pro- 
cesses of mercury chemi-deposition appear to be mainly driven by 
thermodynamic stabilities, and controlled by Pt surface and chlo- 
rine species availability. Based on the mercury deposition chem- 
istry, the split counter-rotating air pre-heater can be retroﬁtted for 
mercury emission control [257] . This method has been tested in a 
pilot-scale coal-ﬁred boiler at Western Research Institute. Mercury 
conversion eﬃciency of 50-65% can be obtained in two separate 
weeks of tests. 

7.3.2. Quantum chemistry calculations 

Hg 0 oxidation or deposition on Pt surface is heavily dependent 
upon the availability and structure of active sites. Compared with 
top and bridge sites, Hg 0  prefers to adsorb on hollow site [380] . 
Hg 0 adsorption on Pt surface leads to a dramatic decrease in the 
work function. Hg 0 is strongly adsorbed on Pt surface, yielding ad- 
sorption energy up to −105.17 kJ/mol. Different Pt surfaces show 
different  reactivity  for  Hg 0  adsorption.  Pt(001)  surface  is  much

The X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) coupled 
with  in-situ  Fourier  transform  infrared  spectroscopy  (FTIR)  is  an 
advanced experimental method for the understanding of Hg 0  ox- 
idation  mechanism  over  RuO 
2  catalyst.  The  active  chlorine 
2 /TiO 
species and HgCl 
2  on catalyst surface are detected by the in-situ 
FTIR [491] and XANES [528] analyses, respectively. The formation 
of  Ru-H  bond  is  an  indicator  of  the  active  chlorine  species,  be- 
cause H atom is produced from HCl dissociation. HCl is dissocia- 
tively adsorbed on RuO 
2 catalyst surface to form active chlo- 
rine species. Subsequently, the gas-phase Hg 0 reacts with the ac- 
tive chlorine species produced from HCl dissociation to form HgCl 
2 . 
Hg 0  oxidation  by  HCl  over  RuO 
2  catalyst  follows  the  Eley- 
Rideal mechanism [ 491 , 528 ]. Gas-phase Hg 0 is ﬁrst oxidized by ac- 
tive chlorine species into HgCl, which is subsequently oxidized into

7.4.2. Quantum chemistry calculations 

The  catalytic  process  of  Hg 0  oxidation  over  RuO 

2 -based cata- 
lysts is controlled by the microcosmic reaction mechanism, which 
depends  on  the  understanding  of  active  sites,  adsorption  en- 
ergy, reaction pathway, and activation energy barrier. Hg 0 prefers 
to  adsorb  on  cus-Ru  sites,  yielding  an  adsorption  energy  of 
−57.47 kJ/mol [400] . HCl activation is an O-assisted surface reac- 
tion process in which HCl is oxidized into active Cl atom for Hg 0 
oxidation [507] . Hg 0  oxidation by HCl over RuO 
2 -based catalysts 
prefers  to  proceed  through  a  four-step  process  in  the  sequence 
of Hg 0 adsorption, Hg → HgCl, HgCl → HgCl 
2 desorption. 
Based on the DFT-derived energetics, the complete catalytic cycle 
proposed by Ref. [507] produces the correct stoichiometry, and is 
used to well understand the reaction mechanism of Hg 0 oxidation 
over RuO 
2 -based catalysts. The catalytic cycle consists of HCl acti- 
vation, mercury oxidation and surface reoxidation. Mercury oxida- 
tion is the rate-limiting step of the complete catalytic cycle. 

2 and HgCl 

The presence of oxygen vacancy shows a signiﬁcant effect on 
Hg 0  oxidation  over  RuO 
2 -based  catalyst,  because  it  changes  the 
energetics  of  reaction  pathways.  For  example,  the  energy  barri- 
ers of rate-limiting steps of Hg 0 oxidation on perfect and oxygen- 
defective  RuO 
2 (110)  surfaces  are  90.94 kJ/mol  and  194.22 kJ/mol, 
respectively [400] . The presence of oxygen vacancy is unfavorable 
for Hg 0 oxidation on RuO 
2 (110) surface. The strong interaction be- 
tween active component and support plays an important role in 
catalytic reaction process [312] . Hg 0 oxidation over RuO 
2 cat- 
alyst differs from that over unsupported RuO 
2 catalyst. The activa- 
tion energy barrier ( ∼150 kJ/mol) of the rate-limiting step of Hg 0 
oxidation  on  RuO 
2 (110)  surface  [507]  is  much  higher  than 
2 /TiO 
that (90.94 kJ/mol) of Hg 0 oxidation on RuO 

2 (110) surface [400] .

Silver  shows  a  high  aﬃnity  toward  mercury  atom  [529] . 
Thus,  silver  is  an  active  component  to  accomplish  Hg 0  re- 
moval  (including  catalytic  oxidation  [530–535]  and  adsorption 
[ 404 , 529 , 536–546 ]) from coal-ﬁred ﬂue gas. Silver is usually dis- 
persed  on  different  supports,  such  as  SCR  catalysts  [531–533] , 
porous materials [ 404 , 536 , 538 , 540 , 541 , 544 , 545 ], carbon materials 
[ 539 , 542 , 543 , 546 ], and metal oxides [ 508 , 530 , 534 , 537 , 547 ].

thermal  stability,  and  lower  reaction  temperature)  for  Cl 
2  pro- 
duction from HCl oxidation under the harsh industrial conditions 
[522–524] . Thus, RuO 
2 -based catalysts also show good activity for 
Hg 0 oxidation [ 370 , 421 , 4 4 4 , 491 , 525 , 526 ]. The reaction mechanism 
of Hg 0  oxidation over RuO 
2 -based catalysts has been understood 
by experimental observations [ 370 , 4 4 4 , 491 ] and theoretical stud- 
ies [ 400 , 507 ].

the resistance to SO

to form HgCl

lower  temperatures  follows  the  Langmuir–Hinshelwood  mecha- 
nism [533] . At the higher temperatures, the Hg–Ag amalgam de- 
composes to generate gas-phase Hg 0 , thereby weakening the amal- 
gamation  effect  of  Hg–Ag  [531] .  The  gas-phase  Hg 0  directly  re- 
acts with active chlorine species. Mercury catalytic oxidation at the 
higher temperatures is dominated by the Eley-Rideal mechanism 
[533] . 

Silver  is  also  a  sorbent  material  due  to  its  high  aﬃnity  to- 
ward  mercury.  In  order  to  decrease  the  cost  of  sorbent  pro- 
duction, silver particle is usually dispersed on different supports 
[ 404 , 508 , 509 , 530 , 536–547 ]. Although these Ag-based sorbents con- 
sist  of  different  support  materials,  these  sorbents  show  similar 
capture  mechanism  for  Hg 0  removal.  Hg 0  capture  by  Ag-based 
sorbents  is  mainly  dominated  by  the  formation  of  Ag-Hg  amal- 
gam (amalgamation mechanism). It may be noted that the silver- 
activated oxygen oxidation mechanism is responsible for Hg 0 cap- 
ture at higher temperatures [404] . 

7.5.2. Quantum chemistry calculations 

Hg–Ag amalgam formation plays an important role in Hg 0 oxi- 
dation over Ag-based catalysts, because it determines the types of 
overall mechanism (Langmuir–Hinshelwood and Eley–Rideal). The 
stability  of  Hg-Ag  amalgam  is  closely  associated  with  the  active 
sites,  binding  energy  and  microcosmic  structure  of  Hg 0  adsorp- 
tion  on  Ag  surface  [ 380 , 500 , 508–510 , 548 ].  Different  Ag  surfaces 
show different adsorption characteristics for mercury. For example, 
Ag(001) surface is more favorable for Hg 0 adsorption than Ag(111) 
surface, because the adsorption energy of Hg 0 on Ag(001) surface 
is higher than that of Hg 0 on Ag(111) surface [380] . On the Ag(001) 
surface, Hg 0 prefers to adsorb on the fourfold hollow sites, whereas 
on the Ag(111) surface, the threefold hollow sites are the dominant 
active sites.

Ag  nanoparticles  are  mainly  dispersed  on  different  supports 
during  catalyst/sorbent  production.  The  single  Ag  surface  with- 
out  consideration  of  support  cannot  well  represent  the  Ag- 
based  catalyst  surface.  The  supported  Ag  surface  model  (such 
as  Ag/Fe 
2 (110)  [ 509 , 510 ],  and  Ag/graphene 
[500] )  can  be  used  to  well  investigate  the  reaction  mechanism 
of Hg 0  oxidation. Hg 0  adsorption on Ag-based catalyst surface is 
an electron-transfer process. During Hg 0 adsorption, electrons are 
transferred from gas-phase Hg 0  to Ag nanoparticles deposited on 
supports. Silver exists in the forms of Ag 0  and Ag + . Ag +  cations 
serve as the active sites for Hg 0 adsorption. Hg 0 is ﬁrst adsorbed 
on Ag +  cation, and subsequently reacts with Ag 0  to form Hg-Ag 
amalgam. Obviously, the formation process of Hg-Ag amalgam can 
be explained by the electron-transfer mechanism. 

8. Challenges and future prospects 

The current review mainly focuses on the reaction mechanisms 
and chemical kinetics of mercury transformation over a wide tem- 
perature  range  during  coal  combustion.  Despite  remarkable  ad- 
vances in the fundamental chemistry that underlies mercury trans- 
formation during combustion, there remain some challenges and 
opportunities to pursue the deeper mechanistic insights into the 
reaction mechanisms and to improve the performance of chemical 
kinetic models. More attention needs to be paid to solve the prob- 
lems/challenges in the chemistry of mercury transformation. Some 
recommendations are summarized below: 

(1) Elementary reaction rate measurements . The homogeneous reac- 
tion  mechanism  of  mercury  transformation  should  be  hierar- 
chically investigated through well-characterized kinetic exper- 
iments. While  there  are  many  room-/low-temperature  kinetic 
measurements of the speciﬁed initiation reactions, kinetic mea- 
surements at medium temperatures (400–950 K) are less well 

documented. Moreover, the subsequent chain branching reac- 
tions of mercury transformation are rarely investigated through 
kinetic experiments. The accuracies of reaction rate constants 
used in the chemical kinetic models are in question, since the 
temperature-dependent rate constants are usually determined 
by  extrapolation  from  the  low-temperature  measurements  or 
by  theoretical  studies  which  are  not  validated  by  medium- 
temperature kinetic measurements. Experimental measurement 
of  the rate  constant  of  the subsequent  chain branching reac- 
tion still remains a challenge at medium temperatures due to 
the toxicity, high volatility, and chemical inertness of mercury. 
A combination of in-situ non-intrusive optical diagnostic tech- 
niques (such as LIF) and high-level theoretical studies is greatly 
needed to obtain an accurate rate constant for elementary re- 
actions. Meanwhile, advanced experimental techniques (such as 
tunable synchrotron photoionization) and analysis methods are 
required for accurate measurements for different mercury spe- 
ciation in ﬂue gas. 

(2) Heterogeneous  reaction  kinetics .  Compared  with  homogeneous 
reaction  mechanism,  heterogeneous  reaction  mechanism  is 
much more complex owing to the diﬃculty of determining the 
reaction rate. The primary challenge that lies ahead is the de- 
termination  of  the  kinetic  and  thermodynamic  parameters  of 
heterogeneous reactions. Although DFT calculations performed 
at  0 K  have  been  extensively  used  to  investigate  the  possi- 
ble process of mercury oxidation over different solid surfaces, 
the  heterogeneous  reaction  mechanism  of  mercury  oxidation 
is  not  well  understood  by  DFT  at  the  speciﬁed  temperature. 
The temperature-dependent DFT calculation is presently an im- 
portant unanswered question in heterogeneous mercury chem- 
istry research. Furthermore, the rate constants of heterogeneous 
reactions of mercury transformation are still rarely calculated 
from the current DFT calculations. The advanced ﬁrst-principles 
quantum-mechanical  calculation  method  [549]  and  the  har- 
monic transition state theory [550] will doubtless play an im- 
portant  role  in  solving  these  problems.  For  the  temperature- 
dependent DFT calculations, the thermochemical properties of 
the surface species need to be calculated using the advanced 
quantum-mechanical method [549] . For the rate constants, the 
harmonic  transition  state  theory  [550]  is  urgently  needed  to 
understand the kinetics of heterogeneous elementary reactions. 
(3) Comprehensive chemical kinetic model . Advances are needed in 
chemical kinetic model development to improve the quantita- 
tive predictability of kinetic model. The existing kinetic mod- 
els cannot well predict mercury speciation distribution in coal- 
ﬁred power plants equipped with SCR devices. There is a lack 
of rate coeﬃcients of heterogeneous elementary reactions over 
SCR catalysts. Moreover, Hg p formation is still not well quanti- 
tatively predicted by the existing kinetic models. The key chal- 
lenge is to understand the reaction chemistry of Hg(NO 
2 and 
4  formation in the channels of the honeycomb SCR cat- 
HgSO 
alysts and to reveal the important physical processes (such as 
collision-coalescence) of mercury species over ﬂy ash. Hg(NO 
3 ) 
2 
4 can be formed over SCR catalysts [ 366 , 551 ], and sta- 
and HgSO 
bly exist in SCR processes. The reaction mechanism of Hg(NO 
3 ) 
2 
4 formation should be investigated using in-situ opti- 
and HgSO 
cal diagnostic techniques and the quantum chemistry calcula- 
tion method. Molecular dynamics simulations can be performed 
to further understand the coagulation mechanism that controls 
Hg p formation. More efforts are required to quantitatively pre- 
4 formation in a practical combustion 
dict Hg(NO 
system.

(4) Kinetic uncertainty quantiﬁcation and propagation . Kinetic model 
development is usually subjected to various uncertainties from 
experimental  measurements  and  theoretical  calculations  (i.e., 
fundamental  theory  assumptions)  [552–555] .  Kinetic  uncer-

tainty quantiﬁcation of mercury reaction chemistry is still not 
performed in a rigorous and systematic manner. Kinetic uncer- 
tainty propagation is not entirely clear in the ﬁeld of mercury 
reaction chemistry. One of the major challenges is the identi- 
ﬁcation of the uncertainty sources (including model input un- 
certainty,  model  form  error,  and  numerical  uncertainty).  For- 
ward uncertainty quantiﬁcation and propagation should be per- 
formed  using  intrusive  or  non-intrusive  methods  to  estimate 
the  model  conﬁdence  when  the  developed  kinetic  model  is 
used to make predictions outside thermodynamic regimes. Ki- 
netic uncertainty minimization is needed to develop a reliable 
kinetic model in the community of mercury reaction chemistry. 
A new direction of efforts should focus on the quantiﬁcation 
and propagation of various uncertainties from experimental ki- 
netics measurements and theoretical kinetics approximations. 

(5) Hetero-/homogeneous elementary reaction chemistry and transport 
coupling . The combustion chemistry community has recognized 
the importance of transport properties in the chemical kinetic 
modeling of hydrocarbon fuels combustion [ 134 , 556 ]. Mercury 
transformation in coal-ﬁred ﬂue gas is a chemically reacting- 
ﬂow problem, and includes mass transfer process and intrin- 
sic reaction process. Mass transfer plays an important role to 
balance  the  chemical  production  and  destruction  of  mercury 
transformation.  The  transport  properties  of  different  mercury 
species are not included in the existing kinetic models of mer- 
cury speciation prediction. The role of mass transfer in mercury 
transformation  (particularly  for  heterogeneous  gas-solid  reac- 
tions)  is  not  well  understood.  An  important  challenge  in  ki- 
netic modeling is how to handle the coupling of ﬂuid dynamics 
and elementary reaction chemistry. Transport parameters (such 
as  viscosity,  diffusion,  thermal  conductivity,  and  thermal  dif- 
fusion) should be investigated using the TRANLIB, MKC, DRFM 
or EGLIB methods. The complex interplay between mass trans- 
fer  and  reaction  chemistry  needs  to  be  clariﬁed  using  direct 
numerical simulations and non-intrusive laser diagnostic tech- 
niques. Meanwhile, transport properties should be incorporated 
into the kinetic model to provide accurate prediction of mer- 
cury transformation during coal combustion. 

(6) Kinetic  model  validation .  While  the  Hg/Cl  and  Hg/Br  sub- 
mechanisms  are  widely  evaluated  with  experimental  data, 
other sub-mechanisms (such as Hg/I, Hg/O, Hg/S, and Hg/N) are 
still not tested by the available experimental data. The applica- 
bility of the existing kinetic models is still rarely evaluated in 
other industrial combustion ﬁelds (such as waste incineration, 
cement production, ferrous and nonferrous metal production). 
Understanding and identifying new reaction pathways that con- 
trol mercury transformation during other combustion processes 
remain a challenge. Experimental efforts are further needed to 
accurately measure the mercury speciation distribution in other 
combustion  atmospheres  using  advanced  measurement  tech- 
niques.  Each  sub-mechanism  should  be  individually  validated 
with a suﬃcient amount of experimental data to improve the 
accuracy and predictability of the kinetic model. 

Recent  progress  in  thermodynamic  calculations  is  discussed 
to understand the compositional properties of mercury-containing 
system at equilibrium state in various reaction atmospheres. Mer- 
cury  speciation  distribution  in  coal-ﬁred  ﬂue  gas  is  affected  by 
many factors such as chlorine content of coal, combustion environ- 
ment (air- and oxy-fuel combustion), ﬂy ash compositions, and op- 
erating conditions. Chlorine is the most important species for mer- 
cury transformation in the post-combustion gases. Oxidized mer- 
cury mainly exists in the form of HgCl 
2 . Oxy-fuel combustion en- 
vironment modiﬁes the behavior and fate of mercury because of 
the CO 
2 -rich ﬂue gas re-circulation to the boiler. Some inorganic 
components present in ﬂy ash affect mercury speciation distribu- 
tion due to their catalytic activity and adsorption capability. 

Experimental  techniques  and  high-level  theoretical  methods 
used  to  achieve  elementary  reaction  rates  are  summarized  from 
measurements and theoretical calculations. The PLP-PLIF technique 
has  provided  a  powerful  tool  for  directly  measuring  elementary 
reaction  rates  of  mercury  oxidation.  The  combination  of  exper- 
imental  measurements  and  theoretical  studies  is  most  welcome 
for rate constants determination and is a signpost for the future. 
The  state-of-the-art,  non-optimized  chemical  kinetic  models  for 
mercury transformation chemistry during coal combustion are re- 
viewed  and  evaluated  against  experimental  data.  Both  homoge- 
neous reactions and heterogeneous interactions with ﬂy ash parti- 
cles are simultaneously involved in the existing kinetic model. The 
predictive capability of each kinetic model is evaluated by compar- 
ison to the updated experimental data. 

Hg 0 oxidation mechanism over different catalysts (such as SCR 
catalyst and noble metal catalyst) is critically reviewed to describe 
mercury catalytic oxidation process. Several mechanisms, including 
Eley-Rideal mechanism, Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism, Mars- 
Maessen mechanism, and Deacon process have been proposed for 
mercury oxidation over catalysts. None of the above mechanisms 
are  deﬁnitive  for  mercury  catalytic  oxidation,  and  the  reaction 
mechanism depends on the type of catalysts and the reaction con- 
ditions. 

These ﬁndings and advances in mercury reaction mechanisms 
and  chemical  kinetics  create  some  new  opportunities  and  chal- 
lenges for the future research. There remain large knowledge gaps 
in the combustion-related mercury transformation chemistry. For 
example, experimental data of kinetic measurements at medium 
temperatures  is  scarce  for  the  subsequent  chain  branching  reac- 
tions  of  homogeneous  mercury  oxidation.  There  is  a  lack  of  ki- 
netic  measurements  or  theoretical  calculations  of  rate  constants 
of heterogeneous elementary reactions. Kinetic modeling involving 
ﬂuid dynamics and reaction chemistry coupling remains challeng- 
ing. The quantiﬁcation and propagation of kinetic uncertainty has 
yet to be undertaken to improve the accuracy of kinetic model. The 
existing kinetic models have not been extensively tested in other 
industrial combustion conditions. In order to address these chal- 
lenges,  future  efforts  on  experimental  measurements,  high-level 
theoretical calculations, and kinetic modeling are needed. 

9. Conclusions 

Declaration of Competing Interest 

Signiﬁcant  advances  in  mercury  reaction  mechanisms  and 
chemical  kinetics  have  been  made  for  the  fundamental  under- 
standing of mercury transformation behavior during coal combus- 
tion. Literatures over the last two decades are surveyed to provide 
a comprehensive and systematical review for mercury transforma- 
tion  chemistry  in  coal-ﬁred  ﬂue  gas.  Thermodynamics  and  reac- 
tion kinetics of mercury transformation in the chemically complex 
post-combustion environment are discussed based on experimen- 
tal measurements, equilibrium calculations, high-level theoretical 
calculations, and kinetic modeling.
