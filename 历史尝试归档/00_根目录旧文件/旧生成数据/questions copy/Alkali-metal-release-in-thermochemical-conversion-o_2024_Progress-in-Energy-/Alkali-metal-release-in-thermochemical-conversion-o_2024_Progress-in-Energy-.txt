Alkali metals, mainly K and Na, which are present in solid fuels such as biomass and coal, play an important role
during their thermal conversion, e.g., in combustion or gasification. At high temperatures, alkali elements will be
released in gas phase as alkali atoms, alkali chlorides, alkali hydroxides and alkali sulphates. In biomass/coal-
fired  boilers,  the  release  of  these  alkali  species  can  cause  problems  such  as  corrosion,  slagging  and  fouling,
threatening the safe operation of the facilities. The information on the release dynamic is important for devel-
oping  proper  models  for  alkali  metal  transformation in  solid  fuel  combustion  and  gasification.  Therefore,  ac-
curate quantitative measurements of the release of different alkali species during thermal-chemical conversion
processes of biomass/coal are important. In this paper, we review literatures published over the last few decades
in  the  field  of  quantitative  optical  measurements  of  alkali  metals  performed  in  combustion/gasification  pro-
cesses, and the release modeling based on those optical measurements. Firstly, the current situation of biomass
and  coal  utilization  is  discussed,  including  the  speciation  of  alkali  metals  in  biomass/coal  and  their  adverse
effects  on  facilities.  Secondly,  requirements  for  optical  measurements  as  well  as  several  quantitative  optical
techniques are introduced including the general principles, typical setups, calibration methods and major ad-
vantages and drawbacks. In contrast to off-line techniques, these optical techniques provide nonintrusive mea-
surements  with  high  temporal  and  spatial  resolution,  which  are  indispensable  for  alkali  release  modeling.
Furthermore,  the  alkali  release  behaviors  based  on  optical  measurements  in  thermochemical  conversion  pro-
cesses  are  discussed.  Based  on  the  experimental  results,  the  kinetic  data  for  alkali  release  were  summarized.
Alkali release modeling was fulfilled relying on the knowledge of alkali release mechanisms and the kinetic data.
In  addition,  simulations  of  alkali  metal  release  with  computational  fluid  dynamics  during  the  biomass/coal
combustion processes are also discussed, providing valuable information for industrial processes. Finally, typical
examples  of  industrial  applications  of  optical  measurement  methods  in  solid  fuel  thermochemical  conversion
processes as well as waste incineration and other processes are presented.

1. Introduction

1.1. Biomass and coal

Energy  supply  is  always  an  important  issue  for  the  economic  and
social  development of  human  society. The usage  of biomass  and  coal
through  thermochemical  conversion  processes  has  played  important
roles in heat and power supply. Fig. 1 shows the global primary energy
consumption in the past 30 years and an outlook of energy consumption
for the coming decades according to the statistics and estimation from

Energy Institution (EI) [1] and British Petroleum (BP) [2], respectively.
As can be seen, the utilization of coal accounts for nearly one-third of
fossil fuel consumption, which means it’s still the major primary energy
in  the  current  world.  However,  due  to  global  warming  and  climate
change, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from each country need to be
strictly regulated according to the Paris Agreement at the Conference of
Parties  21  (COP21)  in  2015.  The  CO2  generated  from  fossil  fuel  con-
sumption is the major contributor to GHG emissions. Currently, many
countries declare to reduce GHG emissions and intend to achieve “zero
carbon  emission”  or  “carbon  neutral  emission”  around  2050–2060.
Therefore,  it  can  be  predicted  that  the  global  energy  supply  and

consumption  patterns  will  dramatically  change  in  the  near  future,
characterized by a reduction in fossil fuel utilization and an increase in
the utilization of renewables and low-carbon, or even carbon-free fuels.
As  a  type  of  renewable  fuel,  biomass  has  similar  properties  to  coal,
especially low-rank coal, which means its utilization does not require a
complete replacement of the existing facilities for fossil fuels. Besides,
biomass can supply stable energy sources compared with intermittent
wind and solar power, which is beneficial for the power grid. It can be
deduced biomass energy will definitely play a more and more important
role  in  the  future.  According  to  the  BP  energy  outlook  2023  [2],  the
proportion  of  renewables  in  global  primary  energy  consumption  will
reach  34.8  %  in  2050,  where  bioenergy  accounts  for  27.3  %  of
renewables.

Biomass  refers  to  all  solid  organic  materials  derived  from  sources
such  as  plants  and  their  products,  animal  biomass,  and  waste.  When
biomass  is  used  as  fuel,  the  carbon  inside  reacts  with  oxygen  and

generates  CO2,  whose  amount  is  equivalent  to  the  amount  absorbed
through photosynthesis. Thus, biomass is regarded as a carbon-neutral
fuel  and  becomes  more  and  more  attractive  as  an  alternative  fuel  to
fossil  fuels  in  thermochemical  conversion  processes,  e.g.,  combustion
and gasification. An important issue that cannot be ignored is the time
lag between the direct CO2  release while utilizing biomass in combus-
tion and gasification processes and its eventual consumption by existing
forests  and  newly  growing  plants.  This  temporary  portion  of  CO2
emissions  also  contributes  to  climate  change  [3].  One  of  the  obvious
mitigation methods is to improve the efficiency of thermal conversion
processes  or  even  adopt  alternative  low-carbon-emission  conversion
techniques,  but  there  is  still  a  long  way  to  go.  Another  strategy  is  to
utilize biomass residues and waste instead of standing trees harvested
from  forests  as  fuel.  This  approach  does  not  deplete  current  carbon
stocks. Through planting new fast-growing crops as a supplement, the
emitted CO2 can be quickly consumed. These fast-growing crops can also

sodium  amount  can  be  up  to  0.3–0.7  %  by  weight  and  over  10  %
expressed by Na2O in ash. The variation in alkali content of biomass is
greater than that of coal. Biomass usually contains a very high level of
potassium, as potassium is the main nutrient for plant growth. Since the
potassium in the soil will be absorbed by plants through the root system
as a nutrient and transported to all areas of the plant, like leaves, trunk,
bark, etc., the alkali content level varies greatly depending on biomass
category and growing environments. Table 1 lists the alkali content in
different  species  of  coal  and  biomass.  As  can  be  seen,  the  potassium
content in herbaceous and agricultural residues is generally higher than
that  in  wood  and  woody  residues.  Even  among  wood  and  woody
biomass, there are differences in potassium content, with bark typically
having  higher  potassium  content  compared  to  wood.  Besides,  the  in-
fluence of the growing environment on the alkali content in biomass is
also significant. While most plants contain more potassium than sodium,
marine algae have a significantly higher content of sodium than potas-
sium. Many studies found that the variations contents of alkali and other
minor elements like Al, Si, and Ca would affect the release behavior of
alkali metals. Therefore, the variation of alkali content, as well as other
ash-forming  elements  in  biomass  and  coal,  is  also  expressed  by  ash
composition as shown in Table 2. Similar to the raw fuel, the content of
alkali elements in the ash also exhibits varying features depending on
the fuel type. The K2O and SiO2  contents in the ash of herbaceous and
agricultural  biomass  like  grasses  and  straws  are  more  than  twice  as
much as those of wood and woody biomass, while the CaO content is
much lower. The Zhundong coal and Loy Yang coal have similar Na2O
content, but there is a significant difference in the content of Al2O3 and
CaO.

1.2.2. Original chemical forms of alkali species in biomass and coal

Generally, the alkali species in biomass and coal can be divided into
two types, i.e., organic compounds and inorganic compounds. Further
determination of  their forms  in  biomass  and coal  can be investigated
using sequential extraction procedures with water, ammonium acetate
solution  and  hydrochloric  acid  solution,  respectively  [30,31].  The
water-soluble (H2O-soluble) compounds of alkali metals are those pre-
sent as ions held by water inside the biomass and coal pore structure
existing  as  water-soluble  salts.  The  ammonium  acetate-soluble
(NH4Ac-soluble)  compounds  are  those  present  as  exchangeable  ions
which are organically boned with carboxyl groups of biomass and coal.
The hydrochloric acid-soluble (HCl-soluble) compounds are those pre-
sent as coordinated metal ions which are organically bonded with ni-
trogen- or oxygen-containing functional groups of biomass and coal. The
acid-insoluble  compounds  are  those  present  as  silicate  minerals.
Generally, inorganic alkali salts in biomass and coal are water-soluble
compounds and organic alkali species may dissolve in water or ammo-
nium acetate solution. Minerals containing alkali metals will dissolve in
hydrochloric  acid  solution  or  be  insoluble  in  any  solution.  The  alkali
content  of  different  occurrence  forms  in  coal  varies  with  coal  rank.
Typically, water-soluble alkali decreases with the degree of coalification
while insoluble-alkali  compounds show  the opposite  tendency. As  for
biomass, alkali metals are primarily organically associated or present as
alkali salts and their contents vary with different types of biomass [32,
33]. Werkelin et al. [34] analyzed the chemical forms of ash-forming
elements in eighteen varieties of woody biomass and found potassium
and sodium were mainly present as water-soluble substances. Vassilev
et al. [35] found that the content of water-soluble alkali in herbaceous
and agricultural biomass was much more abundant than that in wood
and woody biomass. Besides, the amount of water-soluble alkali in coal
was normally lower than in biomass.

Alkali  release  characteristics  during  combustion  and  gasification
processes are strongly related to its chemical forms in raw fuels. It is
generally  believed  that  with  increasing  combustion  temperature,  the
release  ability  of  alkali  metals  will  be  enhanced,  among  which,  the
release of alkali metals mainly comes from water-soluble and NH4Ac-
soluble alkali metals, while the HCl-soluble and insoluble alkali metals

outlook 2023 [2]).

serve as a reliable source of biomass fuel. Additionally, by combining
this approach with carbon capture and storage (CCS), there is a potential
possibility to achieve negative CO2  emissions in combustion and gasi-
fication [4,5].

Considering biomass is worldwide distributed and can be obtained
from  wood  and  woody  residues,  agricultural  residues,  aquatic  plants,
waste, etc. [6], their properties vary a lot. However, in general, biomass
has very high moisture contents and low carbon content, causing lower
heating values and lower energy density compared with conventional
fossil fuels. At the same time, biomass usually has a variety of minor
constituents,  such  as  chlorine,  sulfur,  phosphorus,  nitrogen,  and
ash-forming metals like alkali metals, and many challenges connected
with biomass utilization are caused by these constituents [7]. One of the
major  challenges  while  utilizing  biomass  is  its  high  amount  of  alkali
metals,  especially  potassium,  whose  release  during  thermochemistry
processes  can  cause  serious  problems  such  as  fouling,  slagging,  and
corrosion.  These  problems  pose  a  significant  obstacle  to  the  safe  and
effective utilization of biomass in the industry [8]. Knowledge about the
alkali  release  characteristics  during  utilization  processes  is  an  indis-
pensable step toward addressing these issues.

Some  low-rank  coals  with  large  reserves  but  enriched  with  alkali
metals (mainly sodium), such as Zhundong coal in China, and Loy Yang
coal  in  Australia,  are  also  facing  similar  problems  arising  from  alkali
metals as biomass does. Coal is a kind of fossil fuel with complex com-
ponents that vary from each other. Due to the rich global reserve and
low price, it has been used for a long time in different industries, such as
steel, power, chemistry, paper and textile, etc. Most of these utilizations
are based on thermochemical conversion processes. The striving to get
rid of the use of fossil fuels is underway, however, it is something that
takes time. As can be seen from Fig. 1, the consumption of coal keeps
growing  in  the  past  30  years.  In  the  power  generation  industry,  coal
remains  the  dominant  fuel  with  a  stable  share  of  around  35  %  [1].
Additionally, coal accounts for the largest primary energy consumption
in the Asia-Pacific region with a share of nearly 50 %. Keep improving
the safety and efficiency of coal utilization is still a meaningful issue for
the current global energy system. The huge reserves of high-alkali coal
can largely meet the demand for coal supply, but it is necessary to solve
alkali-induced problems. Understandings on alkali release behavior in
combustion and gasification processes of coal is one of the key factors to
overcome these problems.

1.2.1. Alkali content in biomass and coal

The content of alkali metals, i.e. potassium (K) and sodium (Na), in
biomass and coal varies a lot among different fuel species. Most coals
have an alkali content below 0.01 % by weight. However, in some low-
rank  lignite  and  sub-bituminous  coal,  such  as  Zhundong  coal,  the

are almost not released. The above four chemical forms of alkali metals
can  be  converted  into  each  other  during  thermochemical  conversion
processes. Zhang et al. [18] studied potassium occurrence and release
characteristics and found that NH4Ac-soluble potassium would convert
into water-soluble potassium as the temperature rises. At higher com-
bustion  temperatures,  water-soluble  alkali  metals  can  react  with
silico-aluminate mineral composition inside the fuel forming insoluble
types of alkali metals [31].

1.2.3. Release and transformation of alkali species during thermochemical
conversion

Understanding the alkali release and transformation behavior during
thermochemical conversion processes is the premise for the technology
development concerning alkali-related operation problems. Potassium is
the most  important alkali metal in biomass while sodium is  the most
important one in coal. Compared with coal, a much higher proportion of
alkali species bonded in biomass will be released to gas phase, due to its

Z. Wang et al.

mobile  alkali  composition  forms  [36].  During  the  combustion/gasifi-
cation process, a portion of the alkali metal in the fuel is released in the
form of vapor phase, where it remains gas phase until condensing on the
surface of the heat exchanger after cooling down. The chemical forms of
the released alkali metals are varied depending on fuel compositions and
environmental conditions. Inorganic alkali metals in fuels, such as alkali
chloride, can be directly released into the atmosphere. Organic alkali
metals  will  be  oxidized  and  decomposed  into  alkali  atoms  and  alkali
hydroxides. In addition, a portion of the alkali metals may react with
substances such as Si and Al in the fuel, resulting in the formation of
aluminosilicates which are difficult to release. During the cooling pro-
cess,  the  released  alkali  components  will  condense,  contributing  to
aerosol  formation  and  causing  operational  problems  such  as  deposit
formation.  The  fate  of  the  alkali  metals  before  condensation  would
depend on their interactions with sulfur, chlorine, oxygen, and radicals
in  the gas phase environment. Chlorine and sulfur  in the fuel can in-
crease the mobility of sodium and potassium and thus facilitate alkali
release  as  alkali  chlorides  and  alkali  sulfates  during  combustion.
Adequate  oxygen  in  the  environment  could  oxidize  alkali  atoms  into
alkali  hydroxides.  On  the  contrary,  in  a  reducing  atmosphere,  the
presence of H radicals could reduce alkali hydroxides back into alkali
atoms. In addition, reaction pressure and temperature will also affect
alkali  transformation  paths  and  rates  [37].  Under  low  temperatures,
both  potassium  and  sodium  have  a  very  low  release  level,  while  the
release increases with temperature rising. Although the release charac-
teristics  of  potassium  and  sodium  are  generally  similar  and  can  be
analogized, their behaviors may vary slightly due to differences in the

physical properties of their species. A relatively higher release of sodium
compared with potassium has been reported because of the lower sub-
limation  temperature of  NaCl than KCl  [38].  A  schematic diagram  of
alkali release and transformation during biomass and coal combustion
process is shown in Fig. 2, including typical optical methods that can be
utilized  to  achieve  online  measurements  of  the  critical  gaseous  alkali
species. Detailed release mechanism based on experimental results are
discussed in Section 3.1.

1.3. Alkali metal caused problems

In biomass and coal thermochemical conversion processes, part of
alkali metals will release as gas phase into the hot flue, resulting in a
variety  of problems  such as slagging  and fouling,  agglomeration, and
corrosion. Fig. 3 shows images of slagging, agglomeration, and corrosion
caused by high alkali biomass. Those problems significantly affect the
heat transfer efficiency of the boiler, and even threaten the safe utili-
zation of industrial facilities [39].

Alkali-induced slagging and fouling are attributed to the low melting
temperature of alkali compounds formed in thermochemical conversion
processes  [7].  Wu  et  al.  [44]  compared  slagging  and  deposition  ten-
dencies  between  coals  with  different  alkali  content.  The  results  are
shown in Fig. 4. Obviously, coal with higher alkali content is easier to
cause  slagging.  In  addition,  speciation  of  alkali  metals  is  of  great
importance in terms of slagging propensity since it will affect ash fusion
temperature [45–48]. Studies on biomass show that biomass with high
K2O, P2O5, SO3, Cl2O content is classified as low acidity biomass and has

a  higher  slagging  propensity,  while  biomass  with  high  Na2O,  SiO2,
Al2O3, Fe2O3, TiO2  content is categorized in high acidity biomass and
has a lower slagging propensity as shown in Fig. 5.

A  detailed  mechanism based  on  the  experimental results  was  pro-
posed  to  account  for  the  formation  and  growth  of  the  slagging  layer
[41].  This  issue  is  mainly  associated  with  alkali  chlorides  and  alkali
sulfates  [49,50].  During  thermal  conversion  processes,  alkali  com-
pounds  will  directly  release  in  the  form  of  alkali  vapor.  Chlorine  is
shown to be a major factor in slagging formation, as it facilitates the
mobility of potassium to form potassium chlorides, which are among the
most stable, gas-phase, alkali-containing species [33]. Another impor-
tant factor is sulfur which promotes the transformation to alkali sulfates.
Due  to  the  low  melting  temperatures,  alkali  chlorides  and  sulfates
condense on the heating surface at lower flue gas temperatures, causing
the formation of an initial sticky layer. Fine particles containing alkali
metals,  chlorine,  and  sulfur  deposit  on  the  initial  layer,  and  capture
coarse  large  particles.  The  fine  particles  undergo  re-enrichment  to
maintain their ability of capturing large particles. Thus, slagging struc-
tures characterized by multilayers were observed, as shown in Fig. 3(b).
The  slag  layer  eventually  bonds  tightly  to  the  surface  and  causes  a

serious safety risk to the facilities.

In  addition,  alkali  inherent  in  fuel  and  ash  may  lead  to  bed
agglomeration in fluidized bed (FB) units, which may result in defluid-
ization and even in a costly shutdown of the whole facility [51]. Two
principal  mechanisms  of  agglomeration  were  put  forward:  i.e.
coating-induced agglomeration and melt-induced agglomeration [42].
Coating-induced  agglomeration  is  defined  by  the  interaction  of  alkali
metals in fuel ash with silica in the bed material to form an alkali silicate
melt.  Melt-induced agglomeration is  defined  by  the  presence  of suffi-
cient amounts of alkali metals and silica in the fuel ash which together
form a eutectic melt. Prediction of agglomeration propensity and path
requires  knowledge  about  alkali  behavior  under  high  temperatures.
Agglomeration may also occur in chemical looping combustion (CLC)
[52].  Different  from  that  in  FB,  agglomeration  was  caused  mainly
through  the  melt-induced  path,  since  the  oxygen  carrier  generally
doesn’t contain silicon.

Alkali-induced corrosion is mainly related to alkali chlorides, which
are  highly  corrosive,  especially  under  high  temperatures.  Alloy

materials like chromium (Cr) have been frequently added in Fe- and Ni-
based  alloys  to  prohibit  high-temperature  corrosion.  However,  alkali
chlorides are known to easily react with Cr to form chromium chlorides
and Cl2, which destroys the protective chromium oxide layer on stainless
steels  [53].  Then  Cl2  can  directly  react  with  the  bare  metal  surface,
leading to the corrosion of the materials. One of the possible ways to
mitigate  high-temperature  corrosion  is  to  transfer  alkali  chlorides  to
alkali sulfates, which are less problematic [54,55].

1.4. Scope of article

As  introduced  above,  alkali-induced  problems  affect  the  safe  and
efficient  utilization  of  biomass  and  coal.  To  mitigate  these  issues,
knowledge about alkali behaviors during thermal conversion processes
is  necessary.  Besides,  kinetic  data  for  alkali  release  during  fuel  com-
bustion and gasification processes are needed to develop alkali release
mechanisms  as  well  as  models  for  numerical  simulations.  The  alkali
release behaviors are closely related to fuel compositions and reaction
environments. The alkali content and chemical forms inherent in raw
fuels, the presence of chlorine, sulfur, silicon, aluminum, calcium, etc.,
reaction  temperatures  and  operating  conditions  will  all  affect  alkali
release fates. Optical diagnostics can provide in situ quantitative data
with a temporal resolution, which provides insights into the whole re-
action process with the above variables and an effective way to acquire
kinetic data. In this work, we review the optical diagnostic methods for
various alkali species measurements (Chapter 2). The development of
release mechanisms as well as modeling works based on optical mea-
surements  are  then  summarized  in  Chapter  3.  In  Chapter  4,  we  put
emphasis  on  the  industrial  applications  of  these  optical  techniques.
Finally, an outlook for the further development and applications of these
optical techniques is released in Chapter 5.

2. Optical measurement methods and applications

For optimized utilization of biomass and coal, a comprehension un-
derstanding  of  the  release  and  reaction  of  alkali  metals  is  needed.
Typical off-line methods such as X-ray diffraction (XRD) and inductively
coupled plasma (ICP) can analyze the contents of alkali metals in the
solid  phase  after  time-consumed  pretreatment.  But  the  time-resolved
release dynamic can be hardly obtained especially along with the ther-
mochemical  process.  Although  the  amount  of  alkali  metals  can  be
determined before and after the reaction process, it is still far away from
the requirement for the development of kinetic modeling. In situ or on-
line  measurements  of  alkali  metal  release during  the  thermochemical
reaction process are needed. Nonintrusive optical methods can provide
qualitative  and  quantitative  information  on  alkali  metal  release  with
high temporal and spatial resolution, which have been quickly devel-
oped in the past thirty years.

Optical techniques based on absorption or emission spectroscopy are
the  most  commonly  used  methods  for  monitoring  alkali  species  like
atoms and molecules. In addition, plasma induced by high energy laser
pulse has also been employed to measure the release of total alkali el-
ements during the combustion process. A summary of the cutting-edge
optical methods developed and applied for in situ alkali measurements
during thermal conversion processes of biomass and coal is shown in
Table 3. The principles and applications of these techniques are intro-
duced in the subsequent section. Additionally, Fig. 6 summarized the
optical methods with an emphasis on their emerging years and spatial
resolution ability. As can be seen, many methods with spatial resolution
have  been  developed  in  recent ten  years.  It is  worth  mentioning that
some  long-standing  methods  have  been  developed  to  achieve  spatial
resolution, such as TDLAS. This, on the one hand, is due to the rapid
advancement of imaging technology. But more importantly, it is pivotal
to acquire spatial-resolved information, as this information is crucial for
the  development  and  validation  of  alkali  metal  release  mechanisms,
chemical kinetic models, and numerical simulation methods.

introduced in Section 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4.

(2)  Determination of spectroscopic parameters

Although absorption based methods do not require calibration pro-
cedures, prior knowledge on the spectroscopic parameters such as the
absorption cross-sections and broaden widths are needed. This is crucial
for obtaining accurate results, especially when atomic absorption spec-
troscopy technique is adopted. Those parameters vary with the reaction
conditions  such  as  environmental  temperatures  and  pressures.  Under
some situations, the incident laser light can also have an impact on these
parameters.  For  example,  Thorin  et  al.  [58]  found  that  the  shape  of
atomic absorption cross-section at potassium D1 line increased from a
(cid:0) 1  after laser
full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 0.19 to 0.26 cm
photofragmentation. Since the experimental conditions vary a lot, it is
necessary  to  measure  the  spectroscopic  parameters  separately  before
experiments.

(3)  Knowledge of gas temperatures

As we mentioned above, the absorption cross-section and broaden
width  depend  on  the  gas  temperature.  Therefore,  knowledge  about
temperatures is another key requirement in optical diagnostics. In fact,
not  only  measurements  based  on  absorption  techniques  rely  on  the
knowledge  of  temperatures.  The  optical  signals  based  on  emission
techniques  are  also  closely  related  to  temperatures.  For  spontaneous
emission method, the emission intensity depends on the number density
of  the  alkali  atoms  at  the  upper  stage,  which  in  turn  depends  on  the
temperature.  For  laser-induced  fluorescence  and  laser-induced  photo-
fragmentation  fluorescence,  the  required  quenching  rate  in  the  cali-
bration  expression  is  also  related  to  the  temperatures.  Thus,  the
temperature dependence should also be determined in the calibration
process.

thermal conversion processes of biomass and coal.

2.1. Requirements for quantitative measurements

Quantitative  monitoring  of  key  atomic/molecular  species  is  of
crucial importance in composing predictable kinetic models. To achieve
accurate  measurements,  the  following  requirements  are  to  be
considered.

(1)  Calibration

Usually, it is challenging to obtain the concentration of alkali metals
directly from an optical signal. Thus, a calibration of the optical signals
to  species  concentrations  is  needed.  In  general,  a  basic  calibration
function f  can be expressed as follows:

S = f (c, λ, xi)

(1)

(4)  Signal-to-noise ratio

where S is the signal intensity collected by the detector, c is the con-
centration of target species, λ is the detected wavelength, and xi  is the
magnitude of ith variable, e.g., the optical path length etc.

Depending on the specific features of each technique, detailed cali-
bration methods vary a lot. For absorption measurements, the concen-
tration  determination  is  based  on  the  Beer-Lambert  law.  Thus,
techniques  based  on  absorption  can  be  considered  as  calibration-free
methods  since  the  relationship  between  the  concentration  and  the
signal can be derived, if the variables such as absorption cross-section of
target  species  and  the  optical  path  length  can  be  determined  before
measurement.  For  emission-based  measurements,  calibrations  are
generally needed to obtain the geometry parameters of the system. It is
necessary to confirm that the same arrangement of optical components,
e.g., light source, mirrors, lens, and detectors, are adopted for the cali-
bration and experiment processes. Particularly, the electrical settings of
the detectors should be consistent.

In some cases, geometry parameter is not the only one to be deter-
mined  during  calibration  procedure.  For  example,  in  laser-induced
fluorescence  (LIF)  measurements,  the  fluorescence  quenching  also
needs  to  be  considered.  The  fluorescence  quenching  is  caused  by  de-
excitation  of  the  excited  species  through  collisions  with  other  mole-
cules/atoms,  which  depends  on  collision  partners,  temperature  and
pressure. The determination of the quenching rate, although mandatory
for most quantitative LIF measurements, is a delicate task in LIF mea-
surements. In some special cases, it can be replaced by adopting cali-
bration methods such as using simultaneous absorption measurement to
calibrate the fluorescence signal [11,25,56].

For  measurements  of  the  alkali  metal  emission  at  high alkali  con-
centrations,  self-absorption  needs  to  be  considered  and  the  Beer-
Lambert  law  is  to  be  adopted  [57].  Some  detailed  discussions  about
different  calibration  approaches  of  specific  applications  will  be

The raw  signal  is the  readout by  the  detector  during optical  mea-
surements.  Only  signals  originating  from  the  target  species  provide
useful information for quantitative measurements. Background signals,
detector noises, and interferences from other matrix components such as
polycyclic  aromatic  hydrocarbons  (PAHs)  will  be  regarded  as  noises
during the measurements. The noise should be subtracted properly from
the total signal. However, in some cases, spectral interferences due to
other gaseous species in complex matrices are hard to avoid. Thus, the
signal-to-noise  ratio  (S/N)  is  an  important  parameter  to  evaluate  the
feasibility and precision of the measurements. Optical filters are one of
the  most  common  optical  components  used  to  improve  the  signal-to-
noise ratio by suppressing noise at other wavelengths. Under some cir-
cumstances,  the  polarizer  can  also  be  a  good  choice  to  discriminate
polarized signals from scattering light. More strategies to improve S/N
will be discussed in the introductions of specific optical techniques.

(5)  Detection limits

The detection range of the selected optical technique needs to meet
the requirement of measurement environments. That is, the lowest and
highest  concentrations  occur  during  the  thermochemical  conversion
process should be covered in this range. For absorption measurements,
the chosen wavelength usually plays an important role in the determi-
nation of the detection range. For instance, 769.9 nm is the most com-
mon  wavelength  adopted  for  potassium  measurement  using  tunable
diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS) due to its high sensitivity.
However, optically thick  conditions will arise at a relatively high po-
tassium concentration which limits the dynamic range of this method.
The 404.4 nm, corresponding to 4s →  5p transition of potassium, can
extend  the  detection  range  in  this  case  due  to  the  relatively  smaller

absorption cross-section [59]. For emission measurements, the detector
response has a great effect on the detection range. A suitable electrical
setting  is  crucial  in  avoiding  saturation  of  the  detector  while  having
enough signal-to-noise ratio.

(6)  Discrimination of gas and particle phase for alkali species

In general, alkali metals bonded as silicates and aluminosilicates will
slowly  release  along  with  the  burnout  process  and  the  residues  will
remain in the fly ash. Alkali species such as atomic alkali, alkali chlo-
rides,  alkali  hydroxides,  and  alkali  sulfates  that  lead  to  slagging  and
corrosion will mainly release in the gas phase. Thus, monitoring of the
release of gas-phase alkali metals is critical in most cases. The optical
techniques  introduced  below  including  absorption,  emission,  and
plasma spectroscopy are capable of measuring gas phase alkali metals
under  thermochemical  conversion  processes.  For  some  special  situa-
tions, such as the initial alkali release of the thermochemical process,
both alkali element concentrations in gas phase and solid phase can be
detected.  Techniques  with  the  ability  of  phase  discrimination  are
important  in  understanding  the  characteristics  of  alkali  metals  trans-
formation from solid phase to gas phase and this will be introduced in
Section 2.4.

2.2. Absorption method

Absorption spectroscopy techniques are based on the Beer-Lambert

law,

(cid:0) ln(I/I0) = σNL

(2)

where (cid:0) ln(I/I0) is the absorbance derived from I0  and I which are the
intensity  of  the  light  before  and  after  passing  the  absorbing  species,
respectively, σ is the absorption cross-section, N is the number density of
the species, and L is the optical path length.

The absorption spectroscopy techniques, widely used in the study of
alkali  metals  in  the  thermochemical  conversion  of  biomass  and  coal,
include atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) and tunable diode laser
absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS), which are used for the measurement
of alkali-atom, and broadband absorption spectroscopy (BAS), collinear
photofragmentation and atomic absorption spectroscopy (CPFAAS) and
photofragmentation  tunable  diode  laser  absorption  spectroscopy  (PF-
TDLAS),  which  are  commonly  employed  for  the  measurement  of  gas
phase alkali chloride and alkali hydroxide.

2.2.1. Atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS)

Thanks  to  the  strong  absorption  at  resonant  wavelength,  the  con-
centration of alkali atoms in combustion environments can be measured
with high sensitivity by atomic absorption spectroscopy. This technique
has been widely adopted in the study of alkali-atom reactions in flames.
A typical schematic of AAS optical system is comprised of an absorption
light  source  and  a  monochromator.  A  typical  light  source  could  be  a
tungsten-strip filament lamp, a hollow cathode lamp or an alkali vapor
lamp. As  the  light  passed the  gas  environment  with alkali  atoms, the
light at the absorption lines of the corresponding alkali atom, such as the
D lines of sodium at 588.9/589.6 nm and potassium at 766.5/769.9 nm,
would be absorbed. The intensity of the light at different wavelengths
can be obtained by a monochromator. Based on the intensity of the light
after passing the measurement zone with and without alkali atoms, the
absorbance,  (cid:0) ln(I/I0),  can  be  obtained,  and  the  concentration  of  the
alkali  atom  can  be  calculated  with  a  known  optical  path  length  and
absorption  cross-section  of  the  corresponding  spectral  lines  using  the
Beer-Lambert law, as presented in Equation (2).

In  1965,  Kaskan  [60]  determined  sodium  and  potassium  atomic
concentration in various lean H2/O2/N2  steady flat flames using AAS,
where a tungsten-strip filament lamp was used as the light source, and
the absorption of the resonance lines at 588.9/589.6 nm for sodium and

at 766.5/769.9 nm for potassium was adopted. The measurement was
conducted at different distances from the surface of the burner where the
flat flame was located. A strong decay of the concentration of sodium
and potassium atom was observed to the downstream of the flame (cf.
Fig. 7), and the decay was faster as the flame was leaner. Since the alkali
atom decay rate depended on the oxygen concentration in the hot gas,
the alkali reaction, A + O2  + M →  AO2  + M, was proposed, where A
represents alkali atoms. Using the same technique, McEwan and Phillips
[61] conducted similar work in lean H2/O2/N2 flames and confirmed the
reaction, A + O2 + M → AO2 + M. The authors determined the termo-

Using  AAS,  Carabetta  and  Kaskan  [62]  measured  oxidation  reaction
rates of sodium, potassium and cesium atoms in lean H2/O2/N2 flames.
The  flames  had  a  pressure  varied  from  100  to  1520  Torr  and  a  tem-
perature  range  from  1420  to  1600  K.  The  average  reaction  rates  for
sodium,  potassium  and  cesium  atoms  were  determined  to  be  0.82  ×

Moreover,  Carabetta  and  Kaskan  [63]  investigated  the  sodium
chemi-excitation  process  in  flames  using  direct  atomic  absorption
spectroscopy. The process mostly occurs through the reactions of Na +
O + O →  Na* + O2  and Na + H + H →  Na* + H2. In this work, low
pressure (50–100 Torr) flames were adopted to have an expanded re-
action zone. The concentration of atomic sodium at different distances
from the burner was measured, and together with the concentration of
O, H and OH in the flame, the rate constants for the Na + O + O and Na

more [64] investigated the interaction of NaOH and SO2 in the flue gases
produced by fuel-lean hydrogen-air flames. About 1 ppm sodium was
introduced into the flames, and the concentration of atomic sodium at
different distances from the burner was measured through the absorp-
tion at 588.9 and 589.6 nm. As SO2 was added into the flame, the decay
of the sodium atom concentration from the flame reaction zone to the
downstream  increased.  Based  on  the  comparison  of  the  sodium  atom
concentration in the flames with and without SO2 seeding, the gas-phase
NaOH–SO2  reaction was proposed, i.e., NaOH + SO2  ⇋  NaSO2  + OH.
Durie et al. [65] focused on the gas phase reaction of sodium species and
sulfur  species  in  hydrocarbon  flames.  About  0.1  ppm  sodium  was
introduced into the flame. Using AAS, the effects of SO2 addition on the
sodium  atom  concentration  in  the  flame  were  investigated.  Different
from the formation of NaSO2 in fuel-lean hydrogen flames, in this work,

density  and  spatial/time  resolution  than  those  incoherent  radiation
sources  such  as  a  tungsten-strip  filament  lamp.  Due  to  its  relative
simplicity,  free  of  calibration,  and  high  accuracy,  TDLAS  has  been
widely adopted in combustion diagnostics, especially in industry, where
other laser-based methods are challenging to implement. Comprehen-
sive  reviews  of  the  TDLAS-based  sensors  and  their  applications  were
given by Goldenstein et al. [75] and Bolshov et al. [76]. The application
of  TDLAS  can  achieve  a  significant  improvement  in  the  detection
sensitivity of alkali atoms. A typical optical setup for the TDLAS mea-
surement is shown in Fig. 8 [77], which is mainly comprised of tunable
diode  lasers  and  photodiodes  as  detectors.  The  wavelength  of  the
tunable diode laser scans across the absorption line of the alkali atom,
and the absorption of the light as a function of wavelength can be ob-
tained for the calculation of atomic alkali concentration. An absorption
curve of potassium atoms at 769.9 nm measured by TDLAS is presented
in Fig. 9 [78]. Due to lack of a feasible diode laser at the wavelength for
sodium atoms, the TDLAS system for atomic sodium measurement has so
far not been reported.

As a pioneer work, Groll and Niemax [79] used a tunable diode laser
centered  at  766  nm  measuring  the  concentration  of  potassium  atoms
produced in a commercial laminar air-acetylene analytical flame and in
a  graphite-tube  atomizer.  Schlosser  et  al.  [78]  employed  Fabry-P ́erot
(FP)  and  vertical-cavity  surface-emitting  lasers  (VCSEL)  in  measuring
the concentration of potassium atoms in the flue gas of a pressurized coal
combustion  system  under  various  pressures.  The  absorption  lines  of
potassium atoms at 767.5 and 769.9 nm were adopted. The effect of the
pressure on the spectral broadening and line shift was determined. In the
(cid:0) 3 with a time resolution of
measurement, a detection limit of 10 ng m
1.7 s was achieved. Based on the in situ detection of the trace atomic
potassium  in  combustion  plants,  Schlosser  et  al.  [80]  developed  a
method in evaluating the residence-time distribution of flue gas. In this
work, certain amount of alkali compounds was injected in a short pulse,
and alkali atoms as a tracer were produced from the decomposition of
the alkali compounds after fuel combustion. By monitoring the atomic
alkali  at  certain  positions,  the  residence-time  of  the  flue  gas  was
determined.

However, due to the strong absorption of potassium atoms at 769/
766 nm, especially under the measurement condition with a long optical
path  length,  optically  thick  conditions  occurred.  This  challenges  the
accurate  quantification  using  TDLAS  measurement  as  the  absorption
center becomes optical opaque. As shown in Fig. 10 reported by Qu et al.
[77], a truncated absorption peak was obtained under high concentra-
tion situations. Thus, the wings of the absorption profile were used for
the absorption fitting through a fitting routine described by Qu et al.
[77] to achieve a quantitative measurement under the optically thick
conditions.

Besides the fitting of the wings of the absorption profile, another way

NaSO3 was suggested as the product in the fuel-lean flame and NaS2 in
the fuel-rich flame.

To improve the understanding of the fundamental reaction kinetics
of alkali atoms with various species, such as O2, N2O, and HCl, besides in
the flames, numeral studies have been conducted in a cell heated by an
oven at about 800 K. In the cell, alkali-atom could be produced by UV
photodissociation of alkali halide molecules, such as alkali iodide salt.
The decay of the alkali atom concentration occurred due to the recom-
bination reactions and could be detected using time-resolved AAS. Using
the decay rate, the reaction rate between alkali atom and corresponding
species  was  obtained.  Husain  et  al.  [66,67]  and  Vinckier  et  al.  [68]
investigated the recombination reaction between Na/K and O2. In the
work of Husain et al. [67], besides the potassium atom absorption lines
at 766 nm and 769 nm, the concentration measurement based on the
unresolved  Rydberg  doublet  at  404  nm  was  also  carried  out,  which
showed  a  much  low  absorption  intensity.  The  reaction  rates  of  the
third-order  reactions  between  Na  + O2  + M  at  around  800  K  was

alkali-metal atom and a halogen molecule has been widely investigated
as  the  collision  process  of  these  molecules  are  relatively  simple  with
theoretical  descriptions.  Edelstein  and  Davidovits  [72]  measured  the
reaction rate between the alkali-metal atoms, including Na, K, Rb, and

Cs, with I2 molecules, in a cell heated by an oven at about 600

Besides conventional light sources such as a tungsten-strip filament
lamp,  Slack  et  al.  [73]  used  a  404  nm  laser  as  a  light  source  for  the
potassium atom concentration measurement. The laser was generated
by a tunable dye laser pumped by a frequency doubled Nd:YAG laser.
The work was conducted in laminar flat methane flames with potassium
seeding up to 360 ppm. The measured potassium atom concentration
showed  a  small  decay  with  distance  from  the  burner  under  fuel-rich
conditions, and a rapid decay under fuel-lean conditions. The addition
of potassium accelerated the OH concentration decay especially for the
flames at higher equivalence ratios. The experimental results were used
to evaluate potassium reaction mechanisms and a mechanism with the
most satisfactory agreement was provided.

Recently, Sorvaj ̈arvi et al. [74] used direct atomic absorption spec-
troscopy to measure the K atoms released from burning biomass fuels in
a  single  particle  reactor  at  temperatures  from  850  to  1050
C.  High
amount  of  potassium  atom  was  measured  during  the  devolatilization
stage with a peak value over 200 ppb generated from the decomposition
of alkali-organic compounds and KCl. During the char combustion stage,
the potassium atom concentration strongly depended on the tempera-
ture. About 50 ppb potassium atom was detected at 1050
C, while no
potassium atom was observed at 850

C.

Different from traditional atomic absorption spectroscopy, tunable

Since atomic potassium was considered as a key species in the po-
tassium thermochemistry, accurate measurements of potassium atoms
using  TDLAS  were  widely  applied  in  different  combustion  environ-
ments. Leffler et al. [86], Weng et al. [87,88] and Berdugo Vilches et al.
[89]  investigated  the  potassium  species  balance  between  potassium
atoms and other species, such as KCl, KOH and K2SO4, in various com-
bustion  environments.  Leffler  et  al.  [86]  conduced  measurements  in
KCl/KOH seeded methane/air laminar flames with various equivalence
ratios.  The  hot  gases  produced  by  the  flames  were  measured  to  be
around 1500 K and the addition of potassium varied from ~3 ppm to
~30 ppm. The concentration of potassium atoms in the flame increased
with equivalence ratio. For instance, it increased from 0.3 ppm to 5 ppm
as the equivalence ratio increased from 0.8 to 1.3 with the addition of
~20 ppm KOH in the flame. Similar results were obtained by Weng et al.
[87] for the gases at about 1750 K provided by flames with different
equivalence ratios and the addition of ~20 ppm KOH or KCl (cf. Fig. 11).
The authors presented the positive correlation between potassium atom
concentration  and  gas  temperature  which  varied  from  ~1100  K  to
~1900 K. When SO2 was added into the hot flue gases which contained
~20 ppm KOH or KCl, the concentration of potassium atom decreased
especially  under  the  conditions  of  low  temperature,  such  as  1100  K,
attributed to the sulfation of KOH/KCl [88]. Combining the measure-
ment of the OH concentration in the hot gas, it was found that potassium
atoms enhanced the consumptions of OH radicals and could inhibit the
oxidation of CO in the hot flue gas produced from methane-air flames
[89].

Qu et al. [77] and Weng et al. [90] adopted TDLAS for measurement
of potassium atoms released from burning biomass and coal pellets. The
measurement provided important information to the study of the fate of
potassium during the thermal conversion process of solid fuels. As re-
ported by Qu et al. (Fig. 12) [77], pelletized wood and wheat straw were
burned in a laboratory reactor at 1123 K. For both fuels, significantly
high amount of potassium atom with a concentration of around 3 ppm
was released during the devolatilization stage. During char combustion,
the  detected  potassium  atom  was  much  less  than  the  devolatilization
stage.  The  peak  concentration  was  about  0.1  ppm,  and  the  position
closer to the pellet surface provided a higher potassium atom concen-
tration. Weng et al. [90] measured the release of potassium atom from
pelletized  wood,  straw  and  coal burning in  the  hot gas  environments
provided by laminar flames at about 1700 K. Like the results from Qu
et al. [77], the release had its maximum during the devolatilization stage
for both wood and straw. Coal had much weaker potassium atom release
during the devolatilization stage due to lower volatile content. Sepman
et  al.  [91]  measured  the  concentration  of  potassium  atoms  using  a
TDLAS  system  at  770  nm  in  a  biomass  entrained-flow  gasifier.  The
measurement was conducted together with the CO, H2O, and tempera-
ture  measurements  using  different  TDLAS  systems.  Much  lower

to avoid the optically thick condition is to choose a weaker absorption
line of potassium, such as the line at 404 nm, which is about 30 times
weaker in line intensity. Gustafsson et al. [81] performed measurement
of  potassium  atoms  using  frequency-modulation  absorption  spectros-
copy  using  the  404.8  nm  line.  Recently,  Weng  et  al.  [59]  used  both
absorption  lines,  at  404  and  769  nm,  for  potassium  quantification,
which significantly increased the dynamic range of the measurement.
The potassium atom concertation varying from several ppb up to 20 ppm
could be accurately measured with an optical path length of 100 mm.
TDLAS  is  typically  considered  as  a  line-of-sight  (LOS)  technique,
where the measured concentration is an average along the laser path.
Hence, the concentration information with spatial resolution is missing.
However,  considering  potassium atoms are  excited  during the atomic
absorption  process  in  TDLAS  measurements,  and  the  corresponding
fluorescence from the excited potassium atoms when de-excite back to
the  ground  states  can  be  observed.  Thus,  by  combining  TDLAS  and
imaging,  Gao  et  al.  [82]  reported
simultaneous  fluorescence
one-dimensional quantitative measurements of potassium atoms in hot
flue  gases from  laminar  flames.  In addition,  laser absorption  imaging
(LAI) [83] is another strategy for acquiring spatially resolved informa-
tion.  In  this  method,  the  laser  beam  was  split  into  several  beams  to
measure  the  line-of-sight  concentration  along  each  beam  path.  The
spatial-resolved concentration is then derived through laser absorption
tomography (LAT) technique which reconstructs the three-dimensional
distribution from several two-dimensional projections at different angles
using  inversion  algorithms  [84].  If  the  measured  target  is  cylindrical
symmetry, the reconstructed process can be further simplified using only
one projection. This method was recently adopted by Thorin et al. to
measure  the  concentration  distribution  of  atomic  potassium  in  high
temperature environments and the results agreed well with their pre-
vious results obtained by point measurements [85].

potassium atom concentration was measured in the combustion (~0.01
ppm) than in the gasification mode (~0.1 ppm) of the reactor, and the
potassium atom concentration presented a similar varying trend to the
measured temperature. Later, Sepman et al.  [92] fired  softwood with
artificial air with varying oxygen concentrations in the entrained-flow
reactor. It showed that the concentration of potassium atoms was very
sensitive  to  the  equivalence  ratio.  Furthermore,  Qu  et  al.  [93]  have
applied TDLAS for the measurement of the concentration of potassium
atoms at four different locations of an entrained-flow reactor. The study
was used to understand the thermochemical conversion progress of the
biomass  fuels  in  the  reactor.  The  potassium  atom  concentration
decreased  with  residence  time,  and  an  excellent  agreement  in  the
measurement and thermodynamic equilibrium calculation was obtained
in the gas having a long residence time. Thorin et al. [85] applied LAI
method to measure the distribution of potassium atoms above a burning
wheat straw pellet. The optical setup mainly consists of a diode laser, a
pair of lens (L1 and L2), and a high-speed camera, as shown in Fig. 13.
The laser beam diameter was expanded to 44 mm through the lens-pair
and  projected  onto  the  camera.  By  applying  the  Abel  transform,  the
potassium atom distribution was obtained with a spatial resolution of 2
mm and a time resolution of 0.1 s.

2.2.3. Broadband UV absorption spectroscopy (BAS)

Alkali molecules, such as KCl and KOH, have broadband absorption
spectra,  mainly  in  the  ultraviolet  region,  which  can  be  used  for  the
concentration measurement based on the Beer-Lambert law. A typical
optical setup is shown in Fig. 14. It mainly contains a UV light source,
such as a deuterium lamp or a Xeon lamp, and a spectrometer. To make a
reliable  quantification,  it  is  essential  to  obtain  accurate  spectrally
resolved  UV  absorption  cross-sections  of  different  alkali  molecules.
Quite some efforts have been spent in obtaining the absorption spectrum
of  different  alkali  compound  vapors  at  different  temperatures  in
graphite-furnaces or flames.

[97], Pritchard and Reeves [98], Allain and Mauras [99] and Daminelli
[100]  reported  UV  absorption  spectra  of  NaCl  and  KCl  vapor at  high
C  [98].  The  vapor  of  NaCl  and  KCl  has
temperatures,  such  as  1800
similar absorption spectrum, which is negligibly dependent on temper-
ature. The broadband UV absorption located between 210 and 300 nm
and its peak position was at around 250 nm. At the wavelength close to
200 nm, another strong absorption peak appeared. Furuta et al. [101]
and Daidoji [102] reported UV absorption spectra of NaOH and KOH in
flames.  Different  from  NaCl  and  KCl,  NaOH  and  KOH  have  extra
broadband UV absorption peak located between 300 and 350 nm.

To obtain the absolute UV absorption cross-section of NaCl and KCl,
Davidovits  and  Brodhead  [103]  and  Leffler  et  al.  [104]  introduced
known amount of NaCl and KCl vapor in a sealed quartz tube at varying
temperatures up to around 1100 K, and based on the Beer-Lambert law,
the  absorption  cross-section value  was  calculated  with  known optical
path length (L). Typical UV absorption cross-sections of KCl are shown in

Z. Wang et al.

Alkali chloride presented in flue gases can cause problems of slag-
ging, fouling and corrosion. Converting alkali chloride to alkali sulfate
through  sulfation  is  regarded  as  a  promising  way  to  mitigate  these
problems as alkali sulfate is less corrosive and its melting point is much
higher than alkali chloride. Thus, the gas phase sulfation process of al-
kali chloride and also alkali hydroxide has been conducted in several
studies. Li et al. [107] and Weng et al. [88] investigated the gas-phase
sulfation of KCl and KOH by SO2  in hot flue gases through monitoring
the  concentration  of  KCl  and  KOH  as  different  amounts  of  SO2  were
added  with  a  typical  result  in  Fig.  17.  Both  KCl  and  KOH  could  be
sulfated by SO2 in gas phase to K2SO4 especially at a relative low tem-
perature such as 1100 K. KOH could be sulfated more rapidly than KCl.
Moreover, Leffler et al. [108,109] and Allgur ́en and Andersson [110]
applied  this  technique  to  monitor  the  KCl  vapor  concentration  in
running  furnaces  and  big  test  units.  Allgur ́en  and  Andersson  [110]
investigated  the  chemical  interactions  between  potassium,  chlorine,
sulfur and carbon monoxide in a 100-kW test unit which fired propane in
an air-fuel or oxy-fuel mode.

2.2.4. Collinear photofragmentation and atomic absorption spectroscopy
(CPFAAS)

CPFAAS is a technique combining photofragmentation and atomic
absorption  spectroscopy  to  measure  the  concentration  of  alkali  com-
pounds, such as NaOH, NaCl, KOH, and KCl. Compared with broadband
absorption spectroscopy, CPFAAS shows to be more sensitive and spe-
cies selective. This technique was originally applied in the investigation
of reaction of metal atoms with other molecules (O2, N2O). For example,
Husain  et  al.  [66]  generated  atomic  sodium  from  the  photo-
fragmentation of NaI with the excimer laser or flash lamp, and the decay
of the concentration of atomic sodium after the photofragmentation was
monitored  by  time-resolved  atomic  absorption  spectroscopy  with  a
hollow cathode lamp to study the atomic sodium reaction process.

Sorvaj ̈arvi  et  al.  [74,111,112]  developed  CPFAAS  to  measure  the
concentration of alkali salts, where two collinear light beams were used
(cf. Fig. 18), one was used to photodissociate the alkali salt and the other
was used to measure the concentration of alkali atom fragments. For the
KCl vapor measurement, Sorvaj ̈arvi et al. [111] used a pulsed UV laser at
245  nm  with  a  10  Hz  repetition  rate  and  a  5  ns  pulse  duration  to
photodissociate KCl to generate ground-state potassium atoms. A diode
laser tunable around the potassium atom absorption line near 766.5 nm
was  used  as  the  probe  laser  to  measure  absorption  by  the  potassium
atoms  generated  from  KCl  photodissociation.  Based  on  the  measured
absorption, the concentration of KCl could be derived with a detect limit
of about 1 ppb through the expression [112],

where XKCl  is the KCl concentration, αLmax  is the maximum absor-

perature,  pressure  and  length,  and  σK  and  σKCl  are  the  absorption
coefficient of K atom and KCl at the wavelength of the probing laser and
fragmenting laser, respectively.

Since  the  photofragmentation  was  achieved  using  a  wavelength-
selected  UV  light  source,  only  selected  molecular  was  detected.  Sor-
vaj ̈arvi et al. [74] used two pulse lasers having a wavelength of 266 nm
and 320 nm to selectively measure the concentration of KCl and KOH,
since  266  nm  light  source  could  only  photodissociate  KOH  molecule.
This technique was applied to simultaneously detect the KCl and KOH
vapor released from burning biomass fuels in a single particle reactor
[74]. It was well presented that KCl/KOH was mainly released during
char  combustion  stage.  At  a  low  temperature  (850
C),  KCl  was  the
dominant  potassium  species.  About  10  ppm  KCl  was  detected.  At  a

derive  the  UV  absorption  cross-section  of  KOH  at  high  temperature,
based  on  the  knowledge  of  the  chemical  balance  between  KOH  and
atomic K in different flames and the accurate quantification of potas-
sium atoms using TDLAS as described in Section 2.2.2. At the temper-
atures  of  1400  and  1800  K,  the  absorption  cross-section  of  KOH  was
(cid:0) 17  cm2/molecule at 246.2 nm and
determined to be about 1.26 × 10

Broadband UV absorption spectroscopy has been widely adopted for
the  quantitative  measurements  of  NaCl,  KCl,  NaOH,  and  KOH  in
different  combustion  environments  based  on  their  absorption  cross-
sections. The quantitative measurements facilitate the investigation of
alkali metal thermochemistry. Leffler et al. [86] and Weng et al. [87]
provided experimental data for the understanding of K(cid:0) Cl chemistry in
flames.  The  studies  mainly  focused  on  the  chemical  balance  between
KOH, KCl, and K atoms. The results showed that the balance between
KOH/KCl and K atoms strongly depended on flame equivalence ratio.
Much less KOH/KCl was measured in fuel-rich flames as a notable part of
potassium  was  in the  form of potassium  atoms. The balance between
KOH  and  KCl  was  almost  unaffected  by  flame  equivalence  ratio  but
mainly depended on temperature. More KOH was converted from KCl at
a higher temperature through the fast reaction, KCl + H2O ⇋ KOH + HCl
[87]. Berdugo et al. [89] presented the influence of KOH and KCl on CO
and H2 oxidation in combustion environments through the measurement
of KOH, KCl, and K atoms and OH radicals. It was found that KOH could
inhibit the oxidation of CO and H2 as the consumption of OH radical was
enhanced by the K atoms decomposed from KOH.

2.2.5. Photofragmentation tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (PF-
TDLAS)

The  transmitted  probe  laser  intensity  in  CPFAAS  depends  on  the
product of atomic alkali line strength, atomic alkali concentration, and
the optical path length. Since the probe laser wavelength is often fixed at
the absorption line center of the alkali atoms, the product becomes large
under optically thick conditions, causing the transmitted signal below
the detector’s threshold. In this case, the CPFAAS technique is no longer
capable  of  monitoring  concentrations  of  KCl,  KOH,  and  K  atoms.
Although  the  probe  laser  wavelength  could  be  detuned  from  the  line
center,  the  concentration  calculation  based  on  Equation  (3)  requires
accurate knowledge of the atomic absorption line shape. To solve this
problem,  recently,  Thorin  and  Schmidt  [58,116]  combined  photo-
fragmentation  spectroscopy  and  tunable  diode  laser  absorption  spec-
troscopy (PF-TDLAS) to monitor the concentration of KOH, KCl, and K
atoms. The PF-TDLAS technique employed TDLAS rather than AAS for
the  measurement  of  potassium  atoms.  Since  the  photofragmentation
location could be flexibly chosen within the line shape, the measurement
of alkali atoms and compounds could be possible even in optically thick

situations. A typical schematic of photofragmentation positions selected
in  an  optically  thick  situation  and  in  a  weak  absorption  situation  is
shown in Fig. 19.

For simultaneously monitoring the concentration of KCl, KOH, and K
atoms, Thorin et al. [58] adopted two pulse lasers at the wavelength of
355 nm and 266 nm to dissociate potassium hydroxides and potassium
chlorides,  respectively.  The  generated  potassium-atom  fragments  and
background potassium atoms were both measured by an external-cavity
diode  laser  (ECDL)  scanning  over  0.158  nm  across  the  potassium  D1
line. Two detectors with high bandwidth and low bandwidth were used
to  separately  monitor  the  photolysis-induce  potassium  atoms  and  the
background potassium atoms. Detailed setup of the PF-TDLAS technique
is shown in Fig. 20. The detection limits of 9/16 ppb and 310/630 ppb
under combustion conditions and gasification conditions were achieved
for KOH/KCl.

Moreover, Thorin et al. [117] applied the PF-TDLAS technique in a
140 kW pilot-scale entrained-flow gasifier to measure the KOH, KCl, and
K atom release behaviors. Two types of biomass, i.e., forest residues and
a mixture of forest residues and wheat straw, were studied during the
gasification  process  (at  air-to-fuel  equivalence  ratio  of  0.5)  and  the
combustion process (at air-to-fuel equivalence ratio of 1.3), respectively.

The position of photofragmentation pulses was detuned 7.3 cm
from  the  potassium  D1  line  center,  which  successfully  achieved

[118] used the PF-TDLAS technique to figure out the alkali fate in a 100
kW Oxy-fuel reactor. The optical system was similar to that in Fig. 20,
where a DFB laser scanning over the potassium D2 line at 766 nm was

The emission signal from the atoms in the excited state was collected by
a photo-detection device equipped with a band-pass interference filter
with  the  center  wavelength  at  766  nm.  The  experimental  results  are
shown in Fig. 21(a). It is difficult to quantify the potassium release using
this method, but a relationship between the peak release rate and the
initial potassium content is derived (cf. Fig. 21(b)). In addition, potas-
sium release fraction of different combustion stages can be calculated
using  this  emission  spectroscopy.  In  their  work,  they  found  the  peak
release of potassium occurred in the char stage, which agreed well with
the results from Hsu et al. [57]. Later in 2017 [123], they used the same
system to measure the potassium release from a single pellet under high
temperatures  and  extended  their  work  [124]  in  modeling  the  phase
transformation of potassium species to gas phase. The effects of addi-
tives on potassium release were also estimated in their subsequent work
[125].

Stri ̄ugas et al. [126] used an ICCD camera mounted with different
filters  to  record  Na*,  K*  and  Ca*  chemiluminescence  during  biomass
pellet combustion and thus the two-dimension alkali release character-
istics were obtained during combustion. They investigated the emission
signals of different biomass types at different temperatures. The results
were in good agreement with Mason et al. [122].

Weng  et  al.  [127]  used  emission  from  Na*  and  K*  chem-
iluminescence  to  investigate  the  potassium  and  sodium  release  from
single wheat straw particles in the size range of 224–250 μm burning in
the  hot  flue  gas  produced  by  a  flat  flame  McKenna  burner.  The
arrangement of the devices and optical elements is shown in Fig. 22(a)
and  the  experimental  images  are  shown  in  Fig.  22(b).  The  release
characteristics from the ignition to the early stage of the char oxidation
of the moving burning particles were obtained by an ICCD camera with
spatial  resolution.  The  camera  was  equipped  with  corresponding
band-pass  filters.  They  found  that  sodium  and  potassium  started  to
release  as  volatiles  ignited  and  the  signal  of  sodium  and  potassium
stayed  at  high  intensity  until  the  onset  of  the  char  oxidation  process
since sodium and potassium continued to release during char burning
period. In 2019, Weng et al. [128] extended their work to more types of
biomass, i.e., pine wood, wheat straw, rice husk, and grape pomace. The
CH*, Na*, and K* emission signals were used to represent the volatile
combustion  intensity,  sodium  release  intensity  and  potassium  release
intensity, respectively (cf. Fig. 22 (b)). During the volatile combustion
stage, as shown in Fig. 22 (c), the release of Na and K increased which
was mainly governed by the volatile combustion intensity. At the end of
the volatile combustion stage, the Na* and K* emission signals were still
in  existence,  which  indicated  the  release  of  alkali  metals  from  char
combustion.  In  order  to  eliminate  the  effect  of  volatiles,  Weng  et  al.
employed  Na*/CH*  and  K*/CH*  ratios  to  represent  the  sodium  and
potassium release characteristics as well. They found the ratio of alkali
signal  to  CH*  was  stable  during  the  volatile  combustion  stage  and
abruptly increased which indicated the initiation of the char oxidation
stage (cf. Fig. 22 (c)).

Recently,  He  et  al.  [129]  measured  the  temporal  release  of  total
potassium elements from single biomass pellet combustion using flame
emission spectroscopy and the experimental setup is shown in Fig. 23(a).
The  calibration  of  the  emission  signals  was  achieved  by  seeding  KCl
solutions into the flame with a series of known concentrations. Then,
they analyzed the effects of biomass composition and moisture content
on potassium release. In addition, the temperature of biomass pellet was
also acquired using thermal radiation from the pellet. The experimental
results are shown in Fig. 23(b). Both temporal release of potassium and
temperature  can  be  used  to  distinguish  the  combustion  stage,  i.e.,
devolatilization, char combustion and ash stage.

In general, methods based on chemiluminescence detection require
simple systems that consist of cheap equipment. It can be predicted that
these methods are of great advantage in some harsh situations. How-
ever,  these  methods  usually  do  not  have  the  ability  of  alkali  species
discrimination  as  well  as  spatial  resolution.  Even  with  a  camera,  the
received  emission  signal  is  actually  the  projection  of  the  line-of-sight

adopted as the probe laser. Propane was injected into the reactor as fuel
and KCl solution was seeded into the reactor to provide potassium. In
addition, SO2  was also injected to analyze the sulfation process. While
the  concentrations  of  KOH,  KCl  and  K  atoms  were  monitored  by
PF-TDLAS, a surface ionization detector was employed to monitor the
total alkali concentration in gas phase and in particles through online
sampling  and  analysis  of  the  flue  gas.  By  continuous  monitoring  of
various alkali species and gas temperature, the fate of potassium sulfa-
tion  and  KCl  nucleation  were  observed  in  their  work.  Besides,  by
replacing  the  conventional  TDLAS  with  the  LAI  method  mentioned
above  (cf.  Section  2.2.2),  PF-TDLAS  method  has  the  potential  to  be
applied  to  KOH/KCl  imaging.  Thorin  came  up  with  the  idea  and  the
PF-LAI method has been preliminarily validated capable to measure the
distribution of atomic K, KOH and KCl above heating KCl samples and
burning wheat straw pellets [119].

2.3. Emission

Emission spectroscopic techniques are based on the intensity of the
detected fluorescence signal emitted from target species excited using
different approaches. Techniques including chemiluminescence, laser-
induced  fluorescence  (LIF),  and  laser-induced  photofragmentation
fluorescence (LIPF), have been developed and used for the measurement
of alkali species like atoms, alkali chlorides and alkali hydroxides.

2.3.1. Atomic emission spectroscopy (AES)

Chemiluminescence  is  the  emission  from  the  species  excited  by
chemical reactions rather than radiation [120]. It is widely used due to
lower  requirements  on  devices  and  system  arrangement  than  others,
such as laser-based optical techniques.

In 2007, Jones et al. [121] examined the behavior and the fate of
potassium  in  biomass  combustion  using  emission  spectroscopy  of  po-
tassium atoms. In their study, the emission signal of potassium was used
to  represent  K  release  characteristics.  A  typical  three-stage  evolution
process  of  potassium  release  was  observed.  Two  release  models  were
developed to simulate the first two stages and this will be specifically
introduced in Section 3.2.1. Then, the catalytic effect of potassium on
biomass combustion was investigated. For comparison, potassium was
first  removed  from  the  biomass  through  water-washing  and  deminer-
alization process and then doped into the sample. Simultaneous obser-
vations of the K emission signal and the close-up view of willow sample
combustion were carried out. The results indicated the burnout process
of char residue was extremely slow without potassium but resumed to
the initial speed after re-doping K, which suggested the catalytic effects
of potassium on char combustion.

Mason  et  al.  [122]  applied  emission  spectroscopy  to  measure  the
potassium release from biomass pellets suspended in a methane flame.

signal on the two-dimensional plane. Calibration of these emission sig-
nals is also a tough task. Besides, under the situation with high alkali
concentrations, self-absorption will affect the signal significantly which
decreases the accuracy of this method. These shortcomings require the
use of other measurement methods to compensate.

2.3.2. Laser-induced fluorescence (LIF)

Laser-induced  fluorescence  (LIF)  is  one  of  the  most  widely  used

optical techniques for the investigation of thermochemical conversion
processes.  This  technique  is  based  on  the  fluorescence  emission  from
atoms or molecules that have been selectively excited by laser radiation
[130]. The main issue for quantitative LIF measurement is to convert the
fluorescence signal into the concentration of alkali atoms.

When  the  laser  radiation  intensity  is  high  enough,  the  selected
transition can be saturated and the fluorescence signal is independent of
incident  laser  intensity,  quantum  efficiency  and  collisional  energy

since only point measurements are allowed.

The  3s→3p  atomic  transition  (D  line)  of  alkali  metals  is  the  most
commonly  selected  wavelength  for  both  atom  excitation  and  signal
detection. The resonant light may cause severe scattering and decrease
the signal-to-noise ratio. Weiland et al. [133] examined several alter-
native one- and two-photon LIF techniques to select the best strategy for
use  in  a  fluidized  bed  coal  gasifier  and  combustor.  All  measurement
cases and the relative signal intensity are listed in Table 4. They found
that the single-photon excitation of Na of the 3s →  4p transition near
330 nm and detection of the 3d→3p fluorescence at 818 nm was the
optimum strategy. They also employed a KrF excimer laser producing
light  at  248  nm  to  dissociate  sodium  salt.  The  dissociation  process
created atomic sodium which can be subsequently measured using LIF
technique. More detailed information about the dissociation process and
the excimer laser will be demonstrated in Section 2.3.3.

The  experiments  introduced  above  mainly  focused  on  the  investi-
gation  of  the  atomic  alkali  measurement  methods  and  the  reaction
chemistry of the dominant alkali metal species in different flames with
corresponding  alkali  seeding.  However,  the  measurements  of  atomic
alkali metal under the combustion condition of actual biomass or coal
particles are more complicated, especially the scattering caused by the
volatiles  released  during  the  devolatilization  stage,  which  largely  de-
creases the signal-to-noise ratio. In addition, the thermochemical con-
version  processes  of  biomass  and  coal  are  usually  unsteady  and  vary
from sample to sample. The LIF techniques should have the capacity for
temporal and spatial resolution.

Planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) is a well-established two-
dimensional  (2D)  method  with  its  strength  of  imaging  capacity,  high
sensitivity, and high spatial resolution. A typical PLIF system consists of
a tunable laser, a pair of cylindrical lenses which are used to form the
laser  sheet  and  an  intensified  charge-coupled  device  (ICCD)  camera
orthogonal to the direction of the propagating light sheet.

van Eyk et al. [25] established a quantitative PLIF method to mea-
sure  atomic  sodium  release  from  a  burning  brown  coal  particle  sus-
pended  in  a  flat  flame  as  shown  in  Fig.  24.  One  of  the  key  issues  in
quantitative PLIF measurements is the fluorescence calibration. In their
research, the PLIF signal was calibrated using simultaneous absorption
measurement.  A  certain  amount  of  aqueous  solution  of  Na2CO3  was
seeded in the burner to achieve the calibration process. Sodium D1 line
at 589.59 nm was excited by a Nd:YAG pumped dye laser and then the
fluorescence signal was recorded by an ICCD camera. Two water cells
placed in the laser path before and after the burner, respectively, were
used to record the absorption intensity. The relationship between the
fluorescence  signal  and  laser  absorption  was  built.  Consequently,  the
atomic  sodium  concentration  was  calculated  using  the  Beer-Lambert
law. The results of their study provided, for the first time, 2D quanti-
tative  data  on  atomic  sodium  release  above  a  burning  coal  in  char
combustion and ash stage. A peak that corresponds closely to the end of
char  combustion  was  observed  before  decaying.  An  atomic  sodium
release model was then proposed in a first-order kinetics model that will

coefficient for spontaneous emission, h is the Planck constant, ν0  is the
frequency and nT  is atomic concentration. Atomic sodium concentration
can  be  easily  obtained  by  measuring  (BF)max  and  substituting  it  into
Equation (4). Smith et al. [131] measured the atomic sodium concen-
tration in air-hydrogen and air-acetylene flames to prove this method
works.

Hynes et al. [132] also measured atomic sodium concentration using
saturated  LIF  technique.  Atomic  Na  concentrations  of  different
oxygen-rich hydrogen flames were obtained as well as the concentration
of  OH  radicals.  Chemistry equilibrium  was  assumed to  calculate  con-
centrations  of  H,  O  and  H2.  This  study  extended  the  former  work  of
Smith et al. [131] by analyzing the correlation between Na atom con-
centration  with  [H],  [O],  [OH],  and  [H2]  and  establishing  the  rate
constants of Na, NaOH, NaO2, and NaO reactions with different flame
species.

Saturated LIF measurement has been theoretically and experimen-
tally verified as a feasible method to measure atomic sodium concen-
tration during combustion processes. However, two main disadvantages
restrict its applications in the actual solid fuel combustion processes. On
the  one  hand,  the  sodium  or  potassium  concentrations  in  coal  and
biomass are sometimes of high levels where optically thick conditions
would happen. The high alkali metal concentration between the mea-
surement  point  and  the  detection  device  will  cause  reabsorption  of
fluorescence which leads to a difficult calibration process [133]. On the
other hand, the need for high laser intensity limits the spatial resolution

be  discussed  in  detail  in  Section  3.2.1.  In  the  same  environment,
simultaneous measurement of sodium atom concentration, coal particle
diameter,  and  temperature  was  conducted.  Two-color  pyrometry  was
applied to measure particle temperature with two CCD cameras [134].
They  also  measured  atomic  sodium  release  from  water-bound  and
organically-bound  sodium  [29].  It  is  worth  mentioning  that  the  total
sodium  release  was  also  calculated  in  their  study  by  the  measured
atomic sodium concentration and chemical equilibrium calculations.

The atomic sodium release data during the devolatilization stage was
not included in the work of van Eyk et al. [25,134,135] because of the
strong  Mie  scattering  between  the  incident  laser  and  volatiles.  Wang
et al. [56] employed non-resonant fluorescence to measure the atomic
sodium  release  from  a  burning  coal  pellet  for  the  whole  combustion
process i.e., devolatilization stage, char burnout stage, and ash reaction
stage. A laser pulse at the wavelength of 330.274 nm was used to induce
fluorescence (3s → 4p) from atomic sodium. An ICCD camera was used
to record the fluorescence signal at 589 nm (3p →  3s) from the mea-
surement region. The noise from Mie scattering was effectively avoided
through non-resonant laser-induced fluorescence. The quantitative PLIF
technique  was  also  calibrated  using  laser  absorption.  The  images  of
atomic sodium release in the devolatilization stage, char burnout stage
and ash reaction stage are shown in Fig. 25(a) ~ (c), respectively. The
temporal  concentration  profile  of  Na  at  a  position  14  mm  above  the
pellet is shown in Fig. 26. Two release peaks were observed in the whole
combustion process (cf. Fig. 26), one is in the devolatilization stage, the
other one is in the char burnout stage. The ash reaction stage has a long
decay line along with time. A two-step atomic sodium release model was
established which shows a better predictive ability in the devolatiliza-
tion stage than van Eyk et al. [135].

The  PLIF  technique  was  also  applied  for  measurements  of  atomic
potassium in biomass thermochemical conversion process. Liu et al. [11]
measured the atomic potassium release from a burning biomass pellet
suspended in a methane/air flat flame. Potassium atoms were excited by

a 769.9 nm incident laser sheet to induce fluorescence from the 42s1/2 →
42p1/2  transition.  The  Mie  scattering  was  well  filtered  by  a  polarizer
mounted  before  the  ICCD  camera.  A  better  signal-to-noise  ratio  was
achieved at the cost of signal intensity as shown in Fig. 27. Different
from  the  atomic  sodium  release  from  coal,  the  combustion  time  of
biomass was much shorter under the same weight and diameter condi-
tion (cf. Fig. 27(b)). Only one release peak was observed during corn
straw combustion while two peaks were found in the combustion pro-
cess of poplar. Diameters and surface temperatures were measured at
the same time to derive a kinetic model of atomic potassium release.

2.3.3. Laser-induced photofragmentation fluorescence (LIPF)

Laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) has been successful in quantitative
measurement of alkali atoms with temporal and spatial resolution, but
understanding  of  the  reaction  mechanism  requires  more  quantitative
information on other alkali species as well. Alkali compounds consist of
molecules  with  only  repulsive  excited  electric  states,  i.e.,  the  excited

molecules will spontaneously dissociate into atoms. Thus, most appli-
cations  of  conventional  LIF  were  not  suitable  in  this  case  since  the
quantum  yield  for  fluorescence  will  be  immeasurably  small  [136].
However, incident laser light at a suitable ultraviolet wavelength regime
can dissociate alkali molecules into atoms at excited states. Detection of
fluorescence  from  these  excited  fragmented  alkali  atoms  provides  an
alternative strategy for molecular alkali measurements.

Laser-induced photofragmentation fluorescence (LIPF) is one of the
advanced  optical  techniques  which  employs  UV  laser  light  to  create
atomic  fragments  at  the  excited  state  and  calculated  the  alkali  com-
pounds concentration through atomic fluorescence. UV laser pulses from
an  excimer  laser  [86,137,138]  and  a  frequency-tripled  Nd:YAG  laser
[139]  (355  nm)  are  the  most  commonly  used  in  LIPF  technique.  The
following reactions show the LIPF process:
MX + hν →M∗ + X

(5)

MXn+2hν →M∗ + nX

M∗→M + hν

(7)

where M represents alkali metals and X represents radicals such as Cl
and OH. Measurements of the spontaneous fluorescence from M* pro-
vide qualitative and quantitative information on MX. Both Equation (5)
and Equation (6) express the excitation process for one photon and two
photons,  respectively,  while  Equation  (7)  represents  the  process  to
produce atomic fluorescence. The fluorescence intensity depends on the
exciting  UV  laser  wavelength,  laser  power,  and  the  alkali  compound
properties.  The  requirement  for  the  relationship  between  the  fluores-
cence  signal  and  the  concentration of  alkali  compounds is  one  of the
most important issues in quantitative LIPF measurements.

Oldenborg et al. [136] presented an assessment of LIPF technique for
the determination of gas-phase alkali species in terms of discrimination
potential, sensitivity, and quantitative behavior. The discrimination of
alkali  compounds  with  different  alkali  metals  is  easy  to  achieve  via
different emission wavelengths, i.e., 589 nm for Na and 766 nm for K.
The  different  threshold  wavelengths  for  alkali  compounds  make  it
possible  to  distinguish  alkali  chlorides  and  alkali  hydroxides.  The
threshold  wavelengths  for  some  important  compounds  of  alkali  re-
actions  are  listed  in  Table  5.  The  relationship  between  the  number
density of the alkali compounds and fluorescence intensity is expressed
as Equation (8):

Oldenburg et al. [136] demonstrated the potential of LIPF in online
measurements of alkali compounds. On this basis, Helbel et al. [141]
measured NaCl release from coal in a drop-tube furnace. They investi-
gated the effects of elevated temperatures on NaCl release from different
types of coal. However, the absolute concentration of NaCl release was
not obtained due to the lack of quenching rate. Chadwick et al. [138]
simultaneously monitored NaOH and NaCl release during pyrolysis and
gasification of Loy Yang coal using emission wavelengths of 819 nm and
589  nm,  respectively.  In  their  work,  they  used  an  ArF  excimer  laser
(output wavelength at 193 nm) to dissociate NaOH and NaCl at the same
time. Both of them would produce fluorescence at 589 nm while NaOH
dissociation  would  also  produce  fluorescence  at  819  nm.  Thus,  the
discrimination of NaOH and NaCl was achieved with a detection limit of
0.1 ppb, which is adequate for most situations. The Monte Carlo simu-
lation  was  used  in  their  method  to  modify  the  influence  of  radiation
trapping and quenching phenomena [142]. They found that under the
inert  atmosphere  (pyrolysis  conditions),  NaCl  was  the  dominant  Na
species  and  the  NaOH  concentration  increased  with  oxygen  content,

which agreed with chemical kinetics predictions. Later in 1996, Chad-
wick et al. [143] further investigated the sodium species release during
Loy  Yang  coal  combustion  and  gasification  process  using  the  above
method. In 1997, Chadwick et al. [139] developed a new LIPF method
using 355 nm multiple-photon photofragment fluorescence to measure
gas-phase NaOH. The principle of this method is shown in Fig. 28. The
fluorescence intensity is proportional to the square of the laser power
since multiple-photo excitation is employed in this method. The detec-
tion limit of this method is 0.5 ppm which is less sensitive compared
with  the  excimer  laser  approach.  They  also  proposed  a  theoretical
calculation of wavelength needed to measure  different types of alkali
compounds using Nd:YAG laser. The calculated wavelengths are listed in
Table 6.

In  the  past  30  years,  Monkhouse  and  Gottwald  et  al.  [36,140,
144–150] did a lot of work on the measurements of alkali compounds in
both  lab-scale  and  industrial-scale  flue  gas.  They  investigated  the  in-
fluence  of  fluorescence  quenching  [144]  on  the  detection  of  alkali
compounds  as  well  as  the  effects  of  operating  conditions  [150],  gas
composition  [150]  and  fuel  additives  [147,148].  The  measurement
conditions  of  industrial  scale  mainly  focused  on  fluidized  beds  with
different fuel types [146] and operating parameters [140,145,149]. The
fate  of  alkali  species  in  gasification  has  been  investigated  [151],  in
which few measurements of alkali release concentration were conducted
before.  More  information  on  their  works  in  industrial  boilers  will  be
introduced in Chapter 4 in detail.

Leffler et al. [86,137] developed the LIPF method by capturing the
fluorescence  image  using  an  ICCD  camera.  This  method  gives  a
two-dimension distribution of alkali species and could be useful in the
fundamental  investigation  of  biomass  and  coal  combustion.  Recently,
Weng et al. [152] combined LIPF technique with broadband absorption
spectroscopy  to  measure  the  potassium  species  release  from  single
burning pulverized biomass particles. The results show that KOH rep-
resented  60  %  of  the  total  potassium  release  in  the  char  combustion
stage.

2.4. LIBS spectroscopy

2.4.1. Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS)

Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) has been widely used
for the total potassium/sodium element measurements due to the rela-
tively simple and robust approach. In LIBS system, a high-energy laser is
focused  at  the  measurement  point  generating  a  spark  of  high-
temperature  plasma.  During  cooling  down,  characteristic  spectrum
emission  can  be  detected  by  a  spectrometer  and  the  signal  intensity
represent  the  amount  of  alkali  metal  release  information.  During  the
LIBS process, all the alkali-containing species will be converted into a
plasma  state.  Therefore,  the  LIBS  technology  is  a  kind  of  element
detection  technology  that  cannot  distinguish  the  different  compound
species. Nd:YAG laser is the mostly used laser source to induce plasma at

solid or gas phase. A typical experimental arrangement of LIBS is shown
in Fig. 29.

Hsu  et  al.  [57]  employed  the  LIBS  technique  in  elemental  Na/K
detection and measured the dynamic release behavior of brown coal and
wood pellet. The relationship between LIBS signals and alkali concen-
trations was established through seeding a series of alkali solutions into
the flame (cf. Fig. 30(a)). However, the nonlinearity of the calibration
curve was found because of the self-absorption by atoms of the outer
plasma region and the flame region as shown in Fig. 31. The authors
developed a quantitative method to modify the self-absorption using the
Beer-Lambert law. The corrected LIBS signal shows a very good linear
relationship  with  alkali  concentration  as  shown  in  Fig.  30(b).  The
detection  limits  were  estimated  to  be  29  and  72  ppb  for  sodium  and
potassium, respectively.

He et al. investigated the effects of O2 and CO2 concentrations on the
total sodium and potassium element release of coal [24]. They found
that  both  O2  and  CO2  concentrations  have  little  effect  on  the  alkali
release during devolatilization stage while increasing O2 concentration
promoted  alkali  metal  release  and  increasing  CO2  concentration  sup-
pressed the release in char combustion stage, respectively. The authors
also [153] measured the release of different chemical forms of sodium
from  a  burning  coal  pellet  by  LIBS.  It  was  found  that  the  amount  of
sodium release was in an order of H2O-soluble Na > NH4Ac-soluble Na
> HCl-soluble Na > insoluble Na. Moreover, the additive effects on so-
dium release during coal combustion were estimated [154]. Recently,
the potassium release from two types of biomass, i.e., poplar and corn
straw with different classes of potassium and the additive effects was
investigated by their group [155] using LIBS technique. Different results
were obtained for poplar and corn straw where poplar had two release
peaks while corn straw only had one.

Fatehi et al. [38,156] adopted LIBS to measure the concentration of
total potassium released from gasifying biomass. Potassium release at
different temperatures was investigated in hot gas mixture of CO2, H2O

microwave-assisted LIBS (MW-LIBS). The upper limit of detection can be
improved to over 200 ppm and the minimum detection concentration is
around  10  ppb  and  19  ppb  for  sodium  and  potassium,  respectively.
Recently, Zhao et al. [12] applied a developed calibration method which
also extended the detection range to 200 ppm. They achieved this by
applying the margin area of potassium D2 line (shadow area shown in
Fig. 32 (a)) rather than the center wavelength that is commonly used.
Fig. 32 (b) shows the linearity of this method.

The  above-mentioned  research  activities  mainly  focused  on  gas-
phase total potassium/sodium release during thermochemical conver-
sion processes of coal and biomass. As mentioned in Section 2.1, alkali
can also exist in a condensed phase in the droplets and fly ash particles.
Yuan et al. [159] developed a phase-selective LIBS method to measure
alkali release with the ability to distinguish the existence phase of alkali
species  since  only  breakdown  emission  from  alkali  in  particle  phase
occurs with low laser intensity. Then they applied this method in the
investigation of pulverized coal combustion and analyzed the process of
sodium  release,  especially  in  the  early  stage  of  devolatilization  from
where they found that the ambient temperature had a dominant effect
on the sodium transition from particle to gas phase.

2.4.2. Multi-point laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (M-LIBS)

Studies  mentioned  in  Section  2.4.1  employed  a  single-point  LIBS
measurement to obtain the temporally resolved release behavior of al-
kali metals. Thus, only alkali concentration at the measured point can be
obtained.  This  limits  the  ability  to  acquire  alkali  flux  which  is  an
indispensable parameter to calculate the total alkali release.

As mentioned above, Zhang et al. [10] combined LIBS results with
CFD simulations. A laminar CFD model was used to obtain the distri-
bution  of  potassium.  They  validated  simulation  results  with  11  pine-
wood particles of the same initial mass. The measurement points of these
11 particles were at different radial locations. Thus, the K flux and total

with  different  O2  concentrations.  The  experimental  data  was  subse-
quently used to determine the chemical kinetic constants of potassium
release rate and propose a reaction path of biomass gasification.

Zhang et al. [10] investigated the effect of initial mass on potassium
release  from  a  single  pinewood  pellet.  It  is  worth  noting  that,  they
calculated the potassium flux base on LIBS results and a computational
fluid dynamics (CFD) model. The total amount of potassium release at
different  stages  could  be  calculated  by  flux-time  integrals.  Liu  et  al.
[157]  developed  a  multi-point  LIBS  method  to  obtain  the  alkali  flux
directly from LIBS results which will be introduced in detail in Section
2.4.2.

Self-absorption leads to a non-linear relationship between the signal
intensity and the alkali concentration under high concentration condi-
tions. In general, the nonlinearity is corrected by using a modified Beer-
Lambert law introduced in the work of Hsu et al. [57]. However, this
would cause a poor accuracy at high alkali concentrations. Typically, the
detection limits are below 10 ppm during alkali release measurements
[10,24,57]. Viljanen et al. [158] improved the detection range of alkali
metals by using a novel burner with a modified seeding apparatus and

release  amount  could  be  calculated.  However,  the  accuracy  of  this
method depends on the CFD model which added more uncertainty to the
results. Liu et al. [157] developed a multi-point LIBS method (M-LIBS)
which measured nine points at the same height of different radii within
1 s. The multi-point measurement is achieved by mounting the focusing
lens and signal collection optics on a translational platform. The radial
concentration distribution (CM) of alkali metals (M) can be derived from
LIBS results of these points by a polynomial function fitting. By an in-
tegral  function  (Equation  (9)),  the  alkali  flux  can  be  obtained.  The
arrangement of the M-LIBS method was shown in Fig. 33 (a).

The total amount of alkali release during the whole thermochemical
conversion  process  and  at  each  stage  can  be  calculated  from  time-
integration of the alkali flux. They measured the sodium release char-
acteristics  of  a  burning  coal  pellet  using  this  method.  As  shown  in
Fig. 34, the temporal Na flux profile of the burning coal pellet clearly
indicates the three stages of coal combustion, i.e. devolatilization stage,
char burnout stage and ash reaction stage. The former two stages are
separated by the trough (the green square) and the char burnout stage
and ash reaction stage are separated by the intersection point of two blue
trend lines (the red square). The sodium release proportion in different
stages and the whole combustion process is derived by time integration.
The results are in good agreement with the OES-ICP results which val-
idates the feasibility of their method. Then they [160] studied the effects
of mineral additives on sodium release inhibition and investigated the
transformation of sodium in solid phase with the assistance of XRD re-
sults.  In  2018,  they  employed  this  method  in  biomass  combustion
combined with K-PLIF measurement [11]. The release characteristics of
elemental potassium and atomic potassium were investigated simulta-
neously.  Recently,  He  et  al.  [161]  measured  the  release  behavior  of
potassium  and  zinc  simultaneously  from  a  burning  hyperaccumulator
pellet using the multi-point LIBS method. The total amount of potassium
and zinc release of different chemical groups was studied in this work
and H2O-soluble K and NH4Ac-soluble Zn were found to be the major
released K and Zn compound groups, respectively.

3. Alkali metal release behavior and modeling

In Chapter 2, we introduced several optical methods that can be used
for in situ measurements of various alkali metals in thermal conversion
processes.  In  this  chapter,  we  will  present  the  progress  in  release
mechanisms and release modeling of alkali metals based on measure-
ments using optical methods.

3.1. Alkali metal release behavior

3.1.1. Release mechanism

Knowledge of alkali release mechanisms is of great importance to the
understanding of the behavior of alkali metal release and transformation
as well as the development of the release models. Numerous studies on
alkali release mechanisms were conducted based on off-line sampling
analyses [162–176]. With the  rapid advancement of optical methods,
access to the alkali release behaviors with temporal, spatial, and species
resolutions  promotes  the  development  and  validation  of  the  release
mechanism.

Earlier studies on the release mechanism based on optical measure-
ment results were conducted by van Eyk et al. [135]. They measured the
atomic sodium concentration above a burning Loy Yang coal pellet using
Na-PLIF  and  investigated  the  sodium  release  behavior  with  different
original chemical forms [29]. Based on the experimental results, they
proposed a full mechanism for sodium release during the whole com-
bustion  process,  including  volatile  release,  char  combustion,  and  ash
stage (cf. Fig. 35). In their work, they found that ~33 % of water-bound
sodium  was  released
in  the  devolatilization  stage,  while  no
organically-bound  sodium  release  was  observed  in  this  stage.  Hence
they deduced that the alkali release in this stage was due to the NaCl
vaporization and the remaining portion (~67 %) of water-bound sodium
was  converted  into  organically-bound  sodium.  The  organic  sodium
might be with a form of carboxylic acid sodium ((cid:0) COONa). The study of
brown coal showed that carboxylic acid groups would decompose and
lead  to  a  release  of  CO2  during  pyrolysis.  However,  since  no  organic
sodium was observed to release in this stage, they believed that sodium
was associated with the char structure ((cid:0) CNa) to retain in char particle.
In  the  char  combustion  stage,  they  proposed  an  oxidation/reduction
cycle with sodium phenolate groups ((cid:0) CONa) as the intermediate sub-
stance. The sodium phenolate groups play a role in catalyzing the char
combustion.  They  thought  that  the  rate-determining  step  for  sodium
release during char combustion was the formation of a reduced form of

measurements  of  burning  poplar  and  corn  straw  pellets  as  shown  in
Fig. 37. They took into account the catalytic effect of potassium and an
oxidation-reduction cycle of Char-K was involved in their mechanism.
During the devolatilization stage, some organic K is directly decompose
generating K(g) into gas phase (P1), while the other portion is retained
in  the  fuel  (P2).  Inorganic-K  is  released  into  the  gas  phase  through
evaporation  and  decomposition  (P3).  Besides,  inorganic-K  will  react
with  organic  structures  in  the  biomass  and  be  transformed  to  Char-K
(P4).  They  thought  that  in  the  char  burnout  stage,  Char-K  could  be
released through the path Char-K→CK→K (P6), rather than first oxida-
tion into inorganic K proposed by Zhang et al. [10]. In the ash stage, the
observed potassium release was due to the reaction between water vapor
and potassium in ash (P8).

3.1.2. Factors affect release behaviors

The mechanisms proposed by van Eyk et al. [135] and Zhang et al.
[10] differ a lot. For example, in the mechanism of van Eyk et al., the
release of sodium in the devolatilization stage was all from water-soluble
alkali metals, while in Zhang et al.’s mechanism, the potassium release
may  be  due  to  the  decomposition  of  organic  K.  The  differences  may
attribute  to  several  factors,  such  as  the  difference  in  fuel  types,  the
original  alkali  chemical  forms,  and  reaction  conditions.  Additionally,
these factors can also affect the reaction path of alkali metal in a specific
case. Optical methods provide a powerful way to investigate the effects
of  these  factors,  which  are  meaningful  to  the  development  of
mechanism.

3.1.2.1. The  effect  of  fuel  type. The  effect  of  fuel  type  is  complicated
since it would affect several factors at the same time. For example, the
alkali content, the original chemical forms, the minor element compo-
sitions,  etc.  Weng  et  al.  [90]  compared  the  release  profile  of  atomic
potassium from burning wood, straw, and coal, respectively. As shown
in  Fig.  38,  the  atomic  potassium  release  behaviors  have  a  significant
difference  among  the  fuels  characterized  by  the  reaction  duration,
release intensity, peak values and peak positions. A much greater release
was observed for wood and straw than for coal, due to a lower potassium
content in coal. The same results were also observed by Chansa et al.
[179] and Liu et al. [180]. Some studies attempt to compare the alkali
release  behavior  of  wood  and  straw,  which  represent  two  kinds  of
typical biomass [11,58,77,90]. Herbaceous biomass like straw is typi-
cally rich in both potassium and chlorine. The presence of Cl is known to
promote the release of alkali metals [147,168,170]. Weng et al. [181]
used LIPF to measure the KOH and KCl released from wood and straw

sodium: CONa + C→-CNa + CO, which subsequently led to the rapid loss
of sodium from the particle. The results from the online experimental in
their work also showed that 60 % sodium release occurred at the ash
stage. The most possible form of sodium in ash was Na2O, which will
react with H2O in the ash stage and generate NaOH(g).

Zhang et al. [10] obtained the profile of K release during pinewood
combustion process using the LIBS method and developed a nine-step
mechanism of K transformation for all three stages (cf. Fig. 36). They
divided potassium into two types, Char-K and inorganic K, and indicated
that these two types of K would transform through five possible path
(R1(cid:0) R5, cf. Fig. 36) during the devolatilization stage. After the devo-
latilization stage, the K in the char particle presented as Char-K or po-
tassium  salts.  The  release  of  potassium  from  Char-K  during  char
combustion stage was mainly from two pathways: thermal decomposi-
tion  of  Char-K  (R6)  and  oxidation  to  inorganic  K  from  Char-K  (R7).
However,  they  deduced  that  the  release  rate  of  K  from  the  thermal
decomposition  of  Char-K  was  much  slower  than  that  from  Char-K
oxidation to inorganic K, which was supported by the experimental re-
sults from their previous work [177] and brown coal pyrolysis [178].
Then,  the  generated  inorganic  K  would  decompose  to  release  in  gas
phase (R8) or retain in ash by mineralization effect. A similar release
mechanism was also proposed by Fatehi et al. [156] based on potassium
release measurement using LIBS.

Liu  et  al.  [11]  developed  the  potassium  release  mechanism  of
biomass  proposed  by  Zhang  et  al.  [10]  based  on  their  optical

pellets. Only KCl was observed for the burning straw pellet, while KOH
was  the  dominant  potassium  species  released  from  the  wood,  which
indicated the presence of Cl in straw prompted potassium to release in
the form of KCl. However, one interesting thing is, even though the al-
kali  and  chlorine  content  in  straw  was  much  higher  than  that  in  the
wood  samples  used  in  their  work,  only  10  %  of  potassium  in  straw
samples was released, which was less than the wood sample (about 37
%). This phenomenon was also observe by Qu et al. [77] and Thorin
et al. [58]. One of the possible reason is the high amount of silicon in
straw samples facilitates the forming of K-silicates, thus the potassium
was retained in the ash. It is evident that the effect of minor elements on
alkali metal release is crucial. However, there are relatively limited in
situ investigations about the effect of inherent minor elements in fuel on
alkali  metal  release.  Nevertheless,  numerous  studies  have  been  con-
ducted on the additive effects [12,147,148,154,155,160,161] of alkali
release using in situ optical methods. Interactions between alkali metals
and elements such as Al and Si were also involved in these cases. Hereby,
these studies can provide some insights into the minor element effects.
The  additives  include  synthetic  additives  like  silica  (SiO2)  and
alumina (Al2O3), and natural mineral additives like kaolin, mica, and
pyrophyllite  and  generally  contain  a  high  amount  of  silicon  (Si)  or
aluminum  (Al).  A  comparison  of  the  sodium  release  profile  with  and
without additives during coal combustion processes is shown in Fig. 39.
The inhibition effect of additives on alkali metal release is obvious. This
is probably due to the form of insoluble sodium via reacting between the
additives and water-soluble sodium [160]. These results implies Si and
Al in biomass and coal can prohibit the alkali release.

3.1.2.2. The  effect  of  alkali  chemical  forms. The  effects  of  original
chemical  forms  were  investigated  by  several  researchers  [23,29,153,
182]. These studies varied from fuel types (biomass and coal), optical
method (PLIF, LIBS, and TDLAS) and target species (atoms or elements).
van Eyk et al. [29] investigated the release behaviors of water-bound
and  organic  sodium  from  burning  Loy  Yang  brown  coal.  The  release
fate of sodium atoms during char combustion and ash stage was moni-
tored by Na-PLIF. The results showed that ~67 % of the water-bound
sodium  would  be  released  during  the  char  and  ash  stages,  whereas
~100  % of  the  organically-bound  sodium would  be released  in  these
stages. He et al. [153] investigated release characteristics of sodium with
different original chemical forms from burning Zhundong coal pellets

using  the  LIBS  method.  They  found  that  the  relative  contribution  of
various sodium forms to the total sodium release during each combus-
tion stage was similar, with an order of H2O-soluble Na > NH4Ac-soluble
Na > HCl-soluble Na > insoluble Na. Besides, ~64 % of total sodium
released was observed from H2O-soluble Na, which indicated washing
might be an effective strategy to mitigate alkali-induced problems. Liu
et  al.  [23]  studied the  release  characteristics of  different alkali  forms
using  multi-point  LIBS.  The  real-time  sodium  release  flux  could  be
determined in this setup. The experimental results are shown in Fig. 40.
The  results  showed  that  the  H2O-soluble  sodium  dominate  sodium

release of all reaction stages and account for 76 % of the total sodium
release. Besides, three kinds  of sodium compounds, i.e., NaCl, NaOH,
and Na2SO4 were then enriched into the coal sample to investigate their
catalytic effects. The results showed that sodium additives can be used to
catalyst coal combustion with an order of NaOH > Na2SO4 > NaCl.

The  release  behavior  of  different  potassium  forms  from  a  burning
biomass pellet was also investigated using the similar method. The re-
sults showed that the contribution of H2O-soluble K, NH4Ac-soluble K,
and HCl-soluble K to the total K release were 58.2 %, 27.4 %, and 7.6 %,
respectively  [161].  Recently,  Sun  et  al.  [182]  studied  the  release  of
potassium atoms from pulverized rice husk burning in tubular burner
using the TDLAS method. The effects of O2/N2 and O2/CO2 atmosphere
on potassium release were also investigated. The results are shown in
Fig. 41. As can be seen, the atomic concentration decreased gradually
after  sequential  extraction.  After  removing  the  water-soluble  K,  the
organic K released slower but smoother, corresponding to a secondary
reaction rate of potassium with ash. Besides, the atomic K concentration
profiles  along  the  burner’s  height  indicated  that  the  release  of
water-soluble K mainly occurred at the initial stage and was the fastest.
The release of atomic K in O2/CO2 was slower and weaker than that in
O2/N2  atmosphere, indicating an inhibition effect under oxy-fuel com-
bustion conditions. The inhibition effect was observed more obviously
between two raw rice husk combustion profiles, indicating O2/CO2  at-
mosphere had a more significant effect on the water-soluble potassium
among the four different potassium forms.

3.1.2.3. The effect of reaction conditions. The changes in reaction con-
ditions have a significant effect on the alkali release fates. Temperatures
and  reaction  atmospheres  are  two  of  the  most  commonly  considered
factors.  Increasing  temperature  promotes  the  release  of  alkali  metals,
and this is mainly achieved through two pathways. On the one hand, an
increase in temperature promotes the direct evaporation of alkali chlo-
rides [135]. On the other hand, the increased temperature facilitates the
decomposition  of  both inorganic  K  and  Char-K [11].  Sorvaj ̈arvi  et  al.
[74] measured the release of atomic K, KOH, and KCl from spruce bark
samples burning in a single particle reactor with 10 % O2 and 90 % N2.
They  found  the  release  of  these  potassium  species  increased  with
increasing reactor temperature. Meanwhile, a higher amount of KCl was
release  in  the  devolatilization  stage.  Reaction  atmospheres  will  also
affect the alkali release behavior. Results from Thorin et al. [58] also
showed that the potassium release in the fuel-rich was smaller than that
in the fuel-lean flame. And the main species released changed from KOH
to  atomic  K  when  the  equivalence  ratio  changed  from  fuel-lean  to
fuel-rich.

Regarding the effects of reaction conditions, a special case that has to
mention is the oxy-fuel combustion. Although biomass is considered a
carbon-neutral  fuel,  there  is  still  a  direct  CO2  emission  during  their
thermal  conversion  processes.  Oxy-fuel  combustion  is  a  promising
technology  for  efficient  CO2  capture,  where  pure  oxygen  mixes  with

recycled flue gas to act as an oxidizer for combustion. Thus, the main
components in the gas products are CO2  and H2O. After simplified pu-
rification, the CO2  can be easily captured and stored. A comparison of
gas components of the inlet flue gas between combustion with air and
oxygen is shown Table 7. As can be seen, the oxy-fuel combustion brings
a significant change in the reaction atmosphere compared with air-fuel
combustion, leading to the changes in characteristics of fuel combustion
and influencing the release behavior of alkali metals.

Studies on alkali metal release in oxy-fuel combustion using optical
methods are relatively rare and mainly focus on coal combustion. He
et al. [24] applied LIBS to measure concentrations of elemental Na and K
above the coal pellets burning with varied O2 and CO2 concentrations.
The results of sodium release are shown in Fig. 42. The release of po-
tassium and sodium exhibited a similar pattern. They found neither the
stage duration nor the peak release intensity was observed to change
with O2 and CO2 concentrations in the devolatilization stage. Therefore,
they believed the alkali release in this stage was mainly caused by salt
evaporation. Due to the similarly designed gas temperature, the evap-
oration  intensity  stayed  constant  with  different  concentrations.  How-
ever,  during  the  char  burnout  stage,  the  increasing  O2  concentration
would  promote  the  release  of  Na  and  K,  while  increasing  CO2  would
inhibit their release. This implied in this stage, the release behavior was
closely related to the char combustion. A higher O2 concentration in the
flame enhanced the char combustion by increasing the diffusion rate of
O2, while a higher CO2 concentration showed the opposite tendency. An
interesting  result  was  observed  in  the  ash  stage.  Due  to  the
longest-lasting time, the alkali release amount in this period accounted
for the largest share of the total release, despite the release intensity was
not high. A slight increase in alkali release was observed at a higher CO2
concentration in this stage, while an opposite tendency was observed at
a higher O2 concentration.

The work of He et al. [24] was conducted in premixed-flame con-
ditions.  This  kind  of  setup  provides  convenience  to  optical  measure-
ments, but the reaction atmosphere differs from that of real industrial
facilities. Li et al. [184] and Dong et al. [185] studied the influences of
O2/N2, O2/CO2, and original potassium forms on the alkali release from
coal pellets using the AES method. The sample was placed in a quartz
chamber  where  gas  compositions  could  be  flexibly  adjusted.  A

high-power  laser  was  adopted  for  ignition  and  the  heating  rate  was
changed through varying laser power to mimic the realistic combustor.
The real-time emission spectrum of alkali metals was monitored by a
spectrometer. It should be noted that, due to the lack of a calibration
procedure, the spectrum results couldn’t be used for quantitative mea-
surement  of  alkali  release.  The  experimental  results  showed  that  the
increasing  O2  concentration  dramatically  enhanced  the  observed  so-
dium and potassium signal intensity, which implied more alkali metals
were  released  at  higher  O2  concentrations.  However,  compared  with
O2/N2 cases, the O2/CO2  cases showed a relatively weaker spectral in-
tensity with the same O2 fraction, demonstrating the inhibition of alkali
metals in these cases. Besides, the inhibition effect varied with O2 con-
tent and exhibited a trend of first increasing and then decreasing. To
investigate  the  impact  of  original  chemical  form  of  potassium  on  the
release  behaviors,  two  potassium  species,  i.e.,  K2CO3  and  KCl,  were
added to the coal sample, respectively. As shown in Fig. 43, with the
same  additive  amount,  the  emission  intensity  of  potassium  with  KCl
additive was stronger than that with K2CO3 additive in both O2/N2 and
O2/CO2 cases. However, the difference became smaller with increasing
additive amounts. The release rate of potassium was faster in an O2/N2
atmosphere  than  in  an  O2/CO2  atmosphere.  The  potassium  release
profile in the O2/CO2 atmosphere had a longer devolatilization duration.
The main reason was explained by the substitution of CO2 for N2 reduced
the  heating  rate  of  volatiles  and  suppressed  radical  reactions  which
could promote the combustion rate. The diffusion rate of O2  and vola-
tiles was also slowed down in CO2 atmosphere, causing the volatiles to
burn longer.

3.2. Alkali release modeling

3.2.1. Kinetics modeling of alkali release

The  fate  of  potassium  and  sodium  release  from  biomass  and  coal
during  different  thermochemical  conversion  processes  is  essential  to
understand  corrosion  and  deposition  phenomena  and  ensure  the  safe
operation of power-generation facilities. Release models are valuable to
quantitatively  depict  the  alkali  release  fate.  An  appropriate  modeling
expression of the alkali release procedure relies on accurate real-time
alkali  release  data  and  comprehension  of  release  mechanisms.  The
rapid development of optical diagnostic techniques makes it possible to
obtain  time-resolved  quantitative  data  and  the  release  rate  of  alkali
metals can then be calculated. By combining the experimental results
and kinetic release model, kinetic parameters of alkali release can be
derived. Generally, the rate constant of alkali release is assumed to obey
the Arrhenius  expression with the pellet  temperature. Various optical
diagnostic  techniques  as  well  as  several  thermochemical  conversion
models are employed to derive the kinetic parameters of this expression
for  different  fuels  and  stages.  A  summary  of  rate  constants  of  alkali
release is shown in Table 8.

Jones et al. [121] investigated the potassium release behavior from
biomass particles within a flame environment. The hot flue gas gener-
ated from a CH4/air premixed flame provided a rapid heating rate and
high temperature. According to the spontaneous emission signal of po-
tassium, they divided the potassium release into three stages, i.e. volatile
combustion, char combustion, and ash stages (cf. Fig. 44(a)). In the first
stage, considering the relatively lower temperature, they assumed that
potassium was bounded to or entrained in the decomposing volatiles.

Thus, the release rate of potassium is described by a first-order Arrhenius
expression:

kv = AKe(cid:0) EK/RT

(10)

The  activation  energy  EK  and  pre-exponential  factor  AK  was  not
directly determined from a plot of ln(kv) versus 1/T since quantitative
data of potassium release was not obtained in their work. Instead, the
kinetic  parameters  of  oxygenated  volatile  release  [186]  during  the
devolatilization stage were utilized to estimate the kinetic parameters of
potassium release in this stage. This is feasible since oxygenated vola-
tiles are the dominant products of biomass component decomposition
during  the  devolatilization  stage.  As  for  the  char  burnout  stage,  the
evaporation model developed in Ref. [187] was used to depict potassium
release.  They  assumed that the  main  potassium  salts released in  char
combustion were potassium hydroxides. The impact of the char burning
rate  was  incorporated  through  the  resultant  particle  temperature
(Equation  (11)).  Hence,  the  release  rate  of  potassium  was  given  by
dQKOH/dt as follows:

where QKOH is the total mass of KOH released, t represents time, г is the
mass  diffusivity  of  KOH  in  the  medium,  do  is  the  initial  diameter  of
particle, ρ is density, MKOH is the molecular weight of KOH, pKOH is the
vapor pressure of KOH, T is the particle temperature, and R is the uni-
versal gas constant. Some parameters are accompanied by a subscript t,
which means it is a function of time. A comparison of potassium evo-
lution profiles between experiments and models is shown in Fig. 44. The
general shape of the potassium release curve was well reproduced with

the proposed models (Equation (10) and (11)).

Different from the work by Jones et al. [121], which attributed the
release of potassium during char combustion to the evaporation of alkali
hydroxides,  van  Eky  et  al.  [135]  investigated  the  sodium  release
behavior of Loy Yang brown coal and interpreted the release of sodium
during char combustion stage mainly as char-Na decomposition. Then
they established the relationship between the sodium release and char
surface temperature [135]. A shrinking core model [188] was employed
to  predict  char  burnout  behavior.  Combined  with  the  heat  transfer
model, the particle temperature at various times during char combustion
was  determined.  The  predicted  temperatures  agreed  well  with  the
experimental data measured using two-color pyrometry [134]. The rate
constant  of  sodium  release  was  then  calculated  using  the  following
equation:

kNa(t) =

[ ∫ ∞

WNa,at(t)
∫ t
0 WNa,at(t)dt

0 WNa,at(t)dt (cid:0)

]

(12)

where  WNa,at(t) is  the  total  flow  of  atomic  sodium,  which  is  obtained
from  the  experimental  data  of  van  Eyk  et  al.  [25,134].  An  important
assumption in their work is that the temperature of the char particle is
uniform, which was validated by the value of Biot number (Bi). Another
significant assumption is that all sodium contained in coal is eventually
fully released, which was concluded from the work of Gallagher [172]
and Lindner et al. [189]. Hence it is possible to determine the activation
energy and pre-exponential factor by plotting ln(kNa) versus 1/T. The
Arrhenius  expression  of  sodium  release  during  the  char  combustion
stage was derived as follows:

kc,Na = 105.2±0.4e

(cid:0) 214 kJ/mol
RT

(13)

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience100(2024)10113127

Z. Wang et al.

The release rate of sodium was found independent of particle size,
which  means  that  an  intrinsic  reaction  rate  rather  than  diffusion  is
dominant during char combustion. This also implies Equation (13) will
be valid for both pulverized coal and fluidized bed combustion.

The kinetics model of van Eyk et al. [135] is insufficient to predict
the rate of atomic release at the devolatilization stage. The release of
alkali in this stage is governed by not only the coal burning rate but also
alkali salt evaporation. Liu et al. [11,157] took this influence into ac-
count and divided alkali metals into two types, i.e., alkali compounds
bonded with volatile and alkali compounds bonded with char. Then they
improved  the  kinetic  model  of  van  Eyk  et  al.  [135]  using  a  two-step
model (taking Na as an example):

C&A  is the amount of sodium bonded with char, which  are calculated
from  the  product  of  total  released  sodium  (QNa)  and  date  from  the
proximate analysis. To solve Equation (14), the kinetic parameters of the
dominant process (char combustion stage of coal and the devolatiliza-
tion stage of biomass) was determined first using the method of van Eky
et al. [135] and then these parameters were substituted into Equation
(14) to obtain the other pair of kinetic parameters. The simulation re-
sults from a two-step model successfully predict the alkali release of the
entire combustion period of biomass (Fig. 45(a)) and coal (Fig. 45(b)).
Zhang et al. [10] proposed a kinetic model to depict the potassium
release during the char combustion stage of pinewood. They found that
the  kinetic  parameters  of  potassium  release  were  influenced  by  the
initial  partitioning between the inorganic K and char-K. According  to
their potassium release mechanism [10], the main potassium released
during char combustion is from inorganic K, which is inherent to pine-
wood  or  generated  through  the  char-K  oxidation  process.  Hence,  the
conversion fraction of oxidation of char-K to inorganic K was taken into
consideration. The shrinking core model [188] was employed to calcu-
late  the  char  conversion  fraction.  Assuming  all  of  the  potassium  was
released from inorganic K and the temperature dependence of potassium
release rate by an Arrhenius expression, the pre-exponential factor AK
and activation energy EK during pinewood char combustion stage were
obtained (Table 8).

Fatehi et al. [38,156] measured the quantitative potassium and so-
dium  release  from  a  burning  biomass  particle  at  different  ambient
conditions. The data was used to calculate the kinetic rate constants of

alkali metals during biomass gasification and pyrolysis process in suc-
cession.  A  one-dimensional  model  [190]  was  employed  to  predict
biomass  thermal  conversion  under  the  experimental  conditions.  Ac-
cording to their analysis, the release of alkali species during char and ash
stage was due to the decomposition of carboxylic acid groups and the
relationship  between  the  release  rate  constant  and  temperature
following a first-order Arrhenius expression was derived from LIBS re-
sults and biomass conversion model. However, during biomass pyrolysis
stage,  the  large  temperature  gradient  between  surface  and  center  of
particles  restricted  the  development  of  the  release  model.  Thus,  tem-
perature  at  the  potassium  and  sodium  “reaction  front”  was  adopted
instead of surface temperature. A comparison of potassium release be-
tween LIBS results and kinetics modeling is shown in Fig. 46. The model
shows a good capacity to predict the peak of alkali release in both py-
rolysis and gasification conditions. However, at the early stage of py-
rolysis,  there  is  a  large  discrepancy  between  the  simulation  and  LIBS
results.  This  is  due to ignoring  the  alkali release  at low  temperatures
when estimating the kinetics constants. Recently, Zhang et al. [15,16]
also developed the alkali release model of sawdust pyrolysis and gasi-
fication, respectively. The quantitative gaseous potassium and sodium
release  at  different  temperatures  in  fluidized  bed  was  measured  by
ICP-OES. The results showed that the peak of alkali release rose with
increasing reaction temperature. Besides, the rate of alkali release under
pyrolysis conditions was slightly higher than that of gasification. These
results  indicate  that  temperature  and  atmosphere  have  an  impact  on
alkali release kinetics. Then, the overall kinetic parameters of potassium
and  sodium  release  during  pyrolysis  and  gasification  processes  were
obtained. The pre-exponential factor and activation energy are shown in
Table 8.

3.2.2. CFD modeling of alkali release

The final forms of alkali species in post-flame gases can be modelled
with well-established reaction mechanisms that has been reviewed by
Glarborg and Marshall et al. [191]. However, the dynamic release and
reaction  characteristics  of  alkali  metals  during  complex  reaction  con-
ditions, such as turbulent combustion, are still very rare. The existing
online optical methods are difficult to implement under those situations.
Full-scale three-dimensional simulations of alkali metal release through
high-precision numerical simulation can be an alternative. To carry out
computational  fluid  dynamics  (CFD)  simulation  methods,  two  major
points need to be considered. The first one is to predict the release of
alkali metals from biomass and coal. The amount of the alkali volatiles
released  from  fuels  and  their  exact  chemical  composition  need  to  be
determined  to  provide  initial  conditions  for  further  simulation  in  gas
phase.  This  needs  a  comprehensive  understanding  of  alkali  release
mechanisms and kinetics. Second, the chemical kinetics of various alkali
species in the gas phase is indispensable to simulate the reaction process
and their final states. In addition, deposition models are required if the
deposition  process  is  taken  into  account.  To  date,  the  various  optical
measurements of alkali release behavior can provide information on the

release  compositions  and  release  kinetic  parameters  of  alkali  metals,
which combined with the understanding of alkali chemistry as well as
aerosol formation mechanisms makes it possible to improve the designs
of biomass and coal boilers through CFD simulation methods.

Akbar et al. [192] simulated potassium release and its effect on the
deposition for coals with different chlorine by a three-dimensional CFD
program. The adopted potassium release mechanisms were the models
for sodium proposed by Srinivasachar [193], while the reaction kinetics
and thermal dynamic databases for potassium were taken from the work
of Glarborg et al. [191]. To take into account the influence of turbulence
on chemistry, an Eddy Dissipation Concept (EDC) model described in the
work of Han [194] was also implemented. A deposit formation model
[195] was extended to take into account the effect of condensable po-
tassium  species.  In  order  to  predict  the  deposition  rate,  two  major
deposition  mechanisms, i.e.,  condensation and  inertial impaction was
considered
in  the  model.  Simulations  were  performed  on  an
atmospheric-pressure  drop  tube  reactor  [194]  and  the  results  were
compared with experimental results for high chlorine content coal [196]
and  low  chlorine  content  coal  [197],  respectively.  Good  agreements
were achieved between simulations and experimental data as shown in
Fig. 47. Obviously, the occurrence of high content chlorine facilitates
potassium  release  during  coal  thermal  conversion  process.  Subse-
quently, simulations of different chlorine content biomass at the 0.5 MW
semi-industrial pulverized-fuel combustion facility were performed and
the results showed in Fig. 48 exhibited a similar deposition tendency, i.
e., higher chlorine content leads to higher deposition rates [192]. The
first attempt to combine the kinetic model for alkali sulfation with an
ash deposition model using CFD was reported by Garba et al. [198]. A
reduced  reaction  mechanism from  a  detailed  alkali  mechanism  [199]
and an ash deposition model [200] was integrated in the CFD model to

simulate the initial stage of deposit buildup in a 10 MW industrial test
furnace. CFD results were compared to the experimental data obtained
in the literature [201] (Fig. 49). The comparison showed that the model
was able to adequately reproduce the deposit position and shape in a 10
MW  test  furnace,  but  requires
improvements  for  quantitative
predictions.

Wan  et  al.  performed  high-fidelity  simulation  of  laboratory-scale
pulverized-coal flames to investigate alkali emissions in turbulent gas-
solid  two-phase  flames  [202–206].  The  numerical  modeling  of  alkali
metal reacting dynamics in turbulent pulverized-coal combustion was
evaluated using tabulated sodium chemistry in three-dimensional (3D)
large eddy simulation (LES) [203]. A lookup table was constructed from
a  detailed  sodium  chemistry  mechanism  [191]  including  five  sodium
species, i.e., Na, NaO, NaO2, NaOH, and Na2O2H2, and 24 elementary
reactions. This sodium chemistry table contains four coordinates, i.e.,
equivalence  ratio,  mass  fraction  of  the  sodium  element,  gas-phase
temperature,  and  a  progress  variable.  The  table  was  first  validated
against the detailed sodium chemistry mechanism by zero-dimensional
simulations.  Then,  LES  simulation  of  a  turbulent  pulverized-coal  jet
flame was performed and major coal-flame parameters were compared
against  experiments  [207].  The  chemical  percolation  devolatilization
(CPD) [208] model and the partially stirred reactor (PaSR) [209,210]
model were employed to predict coal pyrolysis and gas-phase combus-
tion,  respectively.  The  response  of  the  five  sodium-species  in  the
pulverized-coal  jet  flame  was  subsequently  examined.  Finally,  a  sys-
tematic global sensitivity analysis of the sodium lookup table was per-
formed and the accuracy of the proposed tabulated sodium chemistry
approach has been calibrated. As shown in Figs. 50 and 51, the results
demonstrate that Na and NaOH are the two major sodium species in the
pulverized-coal turbulent jet flame. The atomic sodium, Na, has a high
concentration in fuel-rich regions; while the highest NaOH concentra-
tion  was  found  in  regions  close  to  the  stoichiometric  condition.  The
fluctuations of the five sodium-species can achieve the same order of
magnitude  as  the  corresponding  mean  values  at  the  jet  centerline,
indicating  that  the  distribution  of  the  sodium  species  is  considerably
affected by the turbulence of the jet flow.

In  their  following  work  [204],  direct  numerical  simulation  (DNS)
was performed to evaluate the possibility of modeling the dynamics of
sodium  species  using  one-dimensional  premixed  flamelet  generated
manifolds (FGM). The DRM22 skeletal mechanism [211] was employed
for  volatile-gas  combustion.  A  sodium  chemistry  lookup  table  was
constructed from laminar one-dimensional premixed flames at various
mixture fractions and enthalpy levels, thus following an FGM tabulation
strategy.  Three-dimensional  simulations  were  performed  with  the
lookup table for sodium species. The predictions of sodium emissions
were compared between tabulation based on one-dimensional premixed
flamelets and DNS results as shown in Fig. 52. Both major and minor

sodium species predicted by FGM tabulation method closely follows the
reference direct numerical simulation, with a Pearson correlation coef-
ficient larger than 0.9.

Wan et al. [205,206] also investigated the effect of HCl and SO2 on
the  alkali  emissions  in  gas-solid  two-phase  flames.  Sodium  emissions
were simulated in both one-dimensional (1D) premixed/diffusion flames
of  the  coal  volatile  and  an  early-stage  two-dimensional  (2D)
pulverized-coal flame (Loy Yang brown coal). In the same way, potas-
sium emissions for the combustion of biomass (corn straw) were simu-
lated. The initial species of Na, K, Cl, and S in the volatile gas was set to
be NaOH, KOH, HCl, and SO2, respectively. The transformation char-
acteristics of alkali species were numerically investigated in both the 1D
and  2D  flames.  The  response  of  the  alkali  chemistry  to  volatile-gas
combustion was analyzed under fuel-lean, stoichiometric and fuel-rich
conditions.  As  shown  in  Fig.  53,  for  the  sodium-enriched  coal,  Na,
NaOH and NaCl were found to be the major sodium species during the
combustion.  NaHSO4  and  Na2SO4  are  the  two  main  sulfated  sodium
species  which  were  formed  mainly  in  the  fuel-lean  region,  but  their
concentrations  were  much  lower  than  that  of  NaCl.  For  the  biomass,
simulations support that KOH is the most significant potassium product
under fuel-lean, stoichiometric and fuel-rich conditions, while the pro-
ductions  of  sulfurous  and  chloric  potassium  species  are  secondary.
Parametric  studies  with  HCl,  SO2  or  both  species  removed  from  the

volatile  are  then  performed  to  investigate  their  effects  on  the  alkali
transformation characteristics in both the 1D and 2D flames. The para-
metric study shows that HCl has a stronger tendency to react with alkali
species than SO2.

4. Industrial applications

In situ optical measurements are required in industries to monitor the
fates  of  alkali  components  contained  in  fuels.  Conventional  sampling
method can only provide time-averaged point data, which is obviously
insufficient especially during plant start-up or on changing the fuel or
operating  conditions.  In  situ  measurements  using  a  variety  of  optical
techniques can realize real-time data acquisition, which is of great sig-
nificance for industrial processes. Fig. 54 shows the real-time potassium
concentration monitoring in a 250 kW coal-fired combustor. A, B, and C
correspond to time periods where the combustor was co-fired with oil.
As can be seen, the variations in atomic potassium concentration caused
by fuel have been observed quantitatively and sensitively. This feature
will benefit the safe and efficient operation of industrial facilities, where
the time-consuming sampling method is still the dominant analysis tool.
However, despite the great development and widespread utilization of
optical methods for measurements of alkali release in laboratory-scale
facilities,  there  are  still  technical  barriers  limiting  the  application  in

industrial  conditions.  The  need  for  optical  access  to  achieve  optical
measurement  is  one  of  the  biggest  challenges.  Modifications  of  the
furnace are needed as laser and optical components are indispensable to
realize in situ measurements based on laser techniques [109,212–214].

In addition, optical devices generally have rigorous requirements to the
surrounding environments while in the field the environment is usually
very  harsh.  Calibration  is  another  big  barrier  since  quantitative  mea-
surements require precise calibration procedures which are not easy to
realize in industrial applications. To date, many efforts have been made
to overcome those difficulties.

Tunable  diode  laser  absorption  spectroscopy  is  one  of  the  most
promising optical techniques to be used in industrial applications since it
is in principle a calibration-free method. Besides, the equipment needed
in this technique, e.g. diode lasers, detectors, and digitizers, are usually
small and portable, making it becomes an ideal method for applications
in industry. Schlosser et al. [78] employed TDLAS to measure potassium
atom concentration in two pulverized-coal-fired (PCF) plants. One of the
PCF plants was at atmospheric pressure with a total power of 250 kW,
the other plant was at 10–16 bar with a total power of 1 MW. Under high
pressure conditions, broadening and shift of K-line were observed and
the pressure-dependent coefficients of pressure-induced broadening and
shift  were  determined.  Comparisons  of  potassium  concentrations  ob-
tained  under  different  pressures  as  well  as  different  oxygen  contents
were discussed in their work to understand the K release characteristics.
Qu et al. [93] also measured atomic potassium concentration during the
softwood  thermochemical conversion  process  using TDLAS. However,
they employed a research-scale entrained flow reactor (EFR) to resemble
the industrial reactor. Simultaneous measurements of gas temperature
and water vapor (H2O) were also conducted, which provide useful data
on understanding of potassium reactions. The results showed that fuel
composition has a higher impact on potassium release compared with
flame equivalence ratio.

Optical emission  spectroscopy is one of the most convenient  tech-
niques used in industries since it employs spontaneous emission from
excited alkali atoms generated in flames and does not need an extra light
source. Hensel et al. [215] designed and tested a real-time alkali monitor
device  named  fiber-optic  alkali  monitor  (FOAM).  The  FOAM  system
consists of a fiber optic, light-filtering background correction part and
high sensitivity photodiode detector. The motivation of their work was
to acquire real-time alkali data in the exhaust of a pressurized combustor
fired with coal-water slurry. Alkali species in flame emit specific fluo-
rescence at the characteristic wavelengths of sodium and potassium and
the consequent emissions were transferred to the detection by the fiber
optic. The detection limits of the FOAM system were determined to be
380 and 800 ppt for sodium and potassium, respectively, with a dynamic
range of four orders of magnitude, which was adequate to monitor alkali
species. Validation experiments of field monitoring of alkali levels in the
exhaust stream of the combustor indicated that this system was capable
of in situ monitoring alkali level under high temperature and pressure

situations.  Yan  et  al.  [216]  adopted  flame  emission  spectroscopy  to
measure the alkali release in an industrial grate municipal solid waste
incinerator.  In  their  work,  a  linear  polynomial  fitting  method  was
employed to uncouple the overlap of the continuous spectrum and the
characteristic  line.  Thus,  both temperatures  and  emission  intensity  of

alkali metals are derived. The emission intensity of alkali metals gave a
straight insight into the effects of operating parameters on alkali release
and can be regarded as an indicator to adjust the air flow rate and fuel
feeding in order to control the alkali level inside the incinerator. Lim
et  al.  [217]  utilized  optical  emission  spectroscopy  to  analyze  the

instrument responds in the field was as the same way as its responds in
the laboratory. Then, calibrations were performed in laboratory using a
nebulizer  to  generate  known  concentrations  of  alkali  metals  and
detected emissions by LIBS to derive the calibration curve, as discussed
in 2.4.1.

Another  emission

laser-induced  photo-
technique,  namely,
fragmentation fluorescence has been applied to in situ temporal moni-
toring  of  alkali  molecules.  Monkhouse  and  co-workers  measured  the
release of Na and K compounds in pulverized [148,150] and fluidized
bed  [140,145–147,149,220,221]  boilers  fed  with  biomass  and  coal.
Optical access is essential to realize in situ laser techniques. Gottwald
and Monhouse et al. [145] designed an optical access to industrial-scale
flue-gas  ducts  under  high  pressure.  They  tested  the  reliability  of  this
system  in  a  pressurized  circulating  fluidized  bed  (PCFB)  combustor.
Alkali release was monitored using LIPF and the results validated the
capability for industrial applications. Later, they investigated the effects
of coal composition [146], operating conditions and additives [147] on
alkali  release  during  fluidized  bed  combustion.  Meanwhile,  they  ach-
ieved phase discrimination of alkali species in PCFB combustion flue gas
[149]. In this case, the laser energy density was kept below the vapor-
ization energy of sodium chlorides, thus only gaseous alkali species was
detected and the gas/particle phase partitioning in the flue gas of a PFBC
pilot facility was obtained. A simultaneous measurement of potassium
and nickel using LIPF was also realized for the first time under flue gas
conditions  [220].  The  results  suggest  that  the  release  of  both  metal
species was affected by both the amount of chlorine and clay minerals in
the system. Glazer et al. [221] further investigated the effects of oper-
ating conditions and additives on the combustion of biomass and coal,
and the effects of Cl and Si on those two fuels were also discussed. Be-
sides,  effects  of  gas  composition,  operating  conditions  and  additives
were analyzed during pulverized particle combustion [148,150]. Erbel
et al. [151] measured the potassium release from gasification process, in
which  understanding  was  lacking.  A  slow  release  of  potassium  was
observed after stopping feeding, which indicates that alkali species had
been taken up in the bed material. Analysis of the bed material proves
this assumption. Furthermore, given the re-release of alkali metals while
the bed was still hot, alkali-containing layers could have formed on the
bed particles but appeared not to form crystalline phases.

One of the greatest progress of alkali measurement in industry-scale
facilities achieved in recent years was the simultaneous measurement of
KOH,  KCl  and  atomic  K  by  PF-TDLAS.  Although  LIPF  can  be  used  to
measure KCl and KOH concentrations, it cannot distinguish one from the
other, since the fluorescence they emit after photolysis is at the same
wavelength. Thus the measured concentration was the sum of KOH and
KCl.  Recently,  Thorin  et  al.  [117]  applied  PF-TDLAS  to  monitor  the
concentration of KOH, KCl, and atomic K in a 140 kW entrained flow
reactor  operated  under  gasification  and  combustion  conditions.  The
results are shown in Fig. 55. A continuous increase in KOH concentra-
tions  as  well  as  a  decrease  in  K-atom  concentrations  was  monitored.
Meanwhile, the KCl concentration kept stable. The drifts in concentra-
tions were probably related to the process of reaching a steady state in
the reactor. The concentration variations caused by the period variation
of fuel feeding were also observed (Fig. 55(b)). These results showed the
sensitivity of the PF-TDLAS method, and this feature is crucial for in-
dustrial applications.

5. Conclusion and outlook

(15)

A big progress in optical methods used to measure the alkali release
behavior in thermochemical conversion processes has been made over

speciation  of  alkali  species  in  a  150  kWth  biomass  furnace  fired  with
sawdust.  The  emission  intensities  of  Na  D  lines  and  K  D  lines  were
related to the number density of Na and K in the excited state. Thus, the
relative number density of Na and K in the ground state was derived
through the Boltzmann law, respectively. The authors thought that those
de-excited alkali metals were in the form of compounds in ash, so the
ratio of the ground-state relative number density of Na and K could be
compared to the ratio of the alkali metal oxides ([Na2O]/[K2O]) in the
ash. The comparison revealed speciation of alkali metals to some extent.
Both  ratios  were  larger  than  a  unity,  which  indicated  that  there  was
more  Na  in  ash  than  K.  Considering  that  K  content  of  biomass  is
significantly  larger  than  Na,  this  phenomenon  explained  that  a  large
amount of K might released as vapor phase and exited through the stack.
Chemiluminescence  emission  spectroscopy  is  a  simple  method  to
monitor  real-time  alkali  behavior  since  there  are  no  rigorous  re-
quirements before implementing this method. However, it is not simple
to  achieve  quantitative measurement  since  independent calibration  is
needed as well as a mass of calculations.

Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy is applied to monitor alkali
metals as well. Like the atomic emission spectroscopy method, spectral
and temporal resolved measurements are achieved. However, a Nd:YAG
laser  is  needed  to  provide  powerful  laser  light.  Blevins  et  al.  [218]
measured concentration of K and Na as well as other metals using LIBS in
three different industrial situations i.e., near the superheater of a 10 MW
electric power generation boiler fired with biomass and coal, at the exit
of a glass-melting furnace burning natural gas with oxygen and near the
nose arches of two paper mill recovery boilers burning black liquor. Both
an echelle spectrometer and linear spectrometers coupled to intensified
CCD cameras were used as detectors. It is worth noticing that discrim-
ination  between  gaseous  and  solid  alkali  metals  was  not  achieved  in
their work and the measured concentration of elemental alkali represent
both gas phase and solid phase. Deguchi et al. [219] realized long-term
Na and K monitoring of a 20000 ton/day cement plant using LIBS. The
system has been working continuously for over a year without any major
problems.  The  results  agreed  well  with  off-line  measurement  results
using  conventional  sampling  method.  The  normal  level  of  Na  and  K
concentration was 10–50 ppb at the measurement point while several
sharp peaks occur indicating corresponding operating condition changes
of the plant. The system showed good capacity of monitoring total alkali
elements  with  reliable  results  and  good  temporal  discrimination.
Although  LIBS  is  also  base  on  emission  spectroscopy  which  means
calibration procedure is needed, the calibration process is not as difficult
as chemiluminescence emission. The relationship of concentration and
emission signal intensity generated from the objective excited atoms in
the plasma can be described by the following equation:

the past decade. Currently, the quantitative monitoring of alkali atoms,
alkali  chlorides,  alkali  hydroxides,  and  elemental  alkali  during  the
whole thermochemical conversion process of biomass and coal has been
achieved. This covers almost all major forms of alkali metals released
into the gas phase. The development of these optical techniques creates
new possibilities for further exploring the alkali release mechanisms and
kinetics. However, as shown in Chapter 3, only a few mechanisms and
release models were developed. Besides, those mechanisms and models
were all derived from the release behaviors of elemental alkali or alkali
atoms. Release characteristics of alkali compounds were absent during
the model developing process. Clearly, this cannot meet our needs for a
comprehensive alkali release model. Additionally, when comparing the
existing release mechanisms, we have observed significant differences
among them. The underlying reason for these differences is the varying
in  multiple  factors  like  the  fuel  composition,  original  alkali  chemical
forms, and reaction conditions, etc. Therefore, it is crucial to understand
the specific impacts of these factors on alkali metal releases. However,
studies on these issues using optical methods are still desired.

Applications of optical techniques in new combustion technology, e.
g., oxy-fuel combustion and chemical looping combustion, are still very
scarce. As shown in Table 7, the reaction atmosphere in oxy-fuel com-
bustion  is  totally  different  from  that  in  air-fuel  combustion,  this  is
manifested not only by the absence of nitrogen but also by a significant
increase  in  vapor  amount  and  SOx  levels  compared  to  conventional
combustion atmosphere. These differences may result in a distinct alkali
metal  release  behavior,  which  should  be  further  investigated.  As  for
chemical looping combustion, the alkali release behavior is crucial since
a high alkali release level may cause the agglomeration of the oxygen
carrier.  However,  there  have  been  no  reports  on  the  measurement  of
alkali species using optical techniques yet.

In addition, despite the techniques based on photofragmentation can
effectively measure KCl and KOH, monitoring of some key alkali species,
such as alkali sulfates, is still challenging. With the presence of sulfur in
the  fuel or in the atmosphere,  alkali sulfates may account  for a large
proportion  of  the  released  alkali  metals.  Photofragmentation-based
techniques may also be capable to measure the alkali sulfates. Howev-
er, the measurement needs knowledge of the spectroscopic information
on alkali sulfates.

Applications  of  optical  techniques  in  industrial  processes  are  still
rare  especially  2D  measurements  of  alkali  species  due  to  the  re-
quirements of proper optical access and operating environments, which
is not easy to realize in the industry field. Improvements in the existing
techniques  to  better  fit  those  harsh  environments  are  essential  for
further utilization of those techniques in industrial applications. TDLAS
as well as TDLAS-based methods like PF-TDLAS are the most promising
optical method. Although the industrial applications of TDLAS for alkali
metal measurements are limited, TDLAS technique has been widely used

in  industrial  applications  for  measuring  other  components  like  CH4,
CO2, O2, etc [75]. It is even possible to achieve three-dimensional dis-
tribution  measurement  through  applying  tomographic  reconstruction.
Therefore, TDLAS method has great potential in the industrial applica-
tion  of  alkali  release  monitoring.  In  addition,  alkali-induced  slagging
and corrosion limit the utilization of biomass and high-alkali coal. In situ
measurement  of  alkali  distribution  near  the  slagging  layer,  which  is
rarely  reported,  is  of  great  importance  to  understand  the  slagging
mechanism.  This  requires  phase-discrimination  ability  of  the  optical
technique. To date, there have been investigations that have achieved
this requirement by adjusting the laser power and we can be optimistic
that this utilization will be fulfilled in the near further.

Swedish  Centre  in  Combustion  Science  and  Technology,
CECOST, and he was part-time visiting professor at Technical
University of Eindhoven between 2005 and 2009. Prof. Ald ́en
has  been  Chairman  of  the  Gordon  Conference  on  Laser  Di-
agnostics of Combustion in 2003 and served as Program co-Chair
of the 31st International Symposium on Combustion in Heidel-
berg  2006.  He  has  got  several  awards,  e.g.  the  ASEA  Energy
Award,  the  Akzo  Nobel  Science  Award  Sweden,  the  Håkan
Friesinger VOLVO Transportation Award and the 2019 AIAA Aerodynamic Measurement
Technology Award. In 2022 Prof. Ald ́en was awarded the Jürgen Warntatz Gold Medal
from the Combustion Institute and the same year he was asked to deliver the Hottel Lecure
at the Introduction of the 39th International Symposium on Combustion in Vancouver.

The scientific activities have ranged from very fundamental studies of laser-matter
interactions to industrially real-world applications. Of his scientific contributions could
be mentioned the first multiple-point spatially-resolved LIF measurements in flames, the
first  detection  of  oxygen atoms  and  CO  molecules  in flames,  the  development  of  dual-
broadband  rotational  CARS,  spatially  resolved  polarization  spectroscopy  applied  in
flames and the development of a high repetition rate laser/detector system for studies of
flames  and  engines  and  the  development  of  thermographic  phosphors  for  combustion
applications.  Prof Ald ́en is member of the Royal  Swedish Academy of Engineering Sci-
ences, IVA, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, KVA, and of The Royal Physiographic
Society in Lund. In 2009 and in 2015 he got Advanced Investigators Grants from the Eu-
ropean Research Council, ERC. He has Honorary Professorships at Xian Jiaotong Univer-
sity and at Tianjin University and is Guest professor at Zhejiang University, all in China.
