    "question_text": "In coal combustion systems, how does chlorine content influence the homogeneous oxidation of elemental mercury (Hg⁰) and what are the key chemical pathways involved? Provide detailed reaction mechanisms and rate constants.",
    "standard_answer": "Chlorine significantly enhances Hg⁰ oxidation through multiple pathways. The dominant mechanisms are: (1) Hg + Cl + M ↔ HgCl + M (k₁ = 4.25E7 cm³/mol·s, Eₐ=17.1 kcal/mol), (2) HgCl + Cl₂ → HgCl₂ + Cl (k₃=5.18E4 cm³/mol·s). At temperatures >600°C, HCl becomes the primary oxidant via Eley-Rideal mechanism where HCl dissociates on fly ash surfaces to form active Cl sites. Below 500°C, Cl₂ dominates through direct gas-phase reactions. The oxidation efficiency follows Cl radical > Cl₂ > HCl due to their bond dissociation energies (Cl-Cl: 242 kJ/mol vs H-Cl: 431 kJ/mol). Thermodynamic equilibrium predicts complete conversion to HgCl₂ below 452°C, but kinetic limitations in real systems typically yield 30-95% oxidation.",
    "original_text": {
      "1": "Chlorine is considered as the key element for Hg⁰ oxidation. During coal combustion, chlorine in coal will be released in the main form of atomic Cl, which transforms into HCl or Cl₂ with flue gas cooling.",
      "2": "The conversion of Hg + Cl₂ → HgCl₂ was faster or comparable to those with Cl₂, while reactions between Hg/HgCl and HCl were the lowest."

    "standard_answer": "The breakthrough rate is defined as BR = (m₂/m₁)×100%, where m₁ is mercury mass in the first adsorbent section and m₂ in the second section. For a fixed-bed reactor, the adsorption capacity q (μg/g) relates to SO₂ concentration via competitive adsorption: q = q₀/(1 + Kₛ[SO₂]), where q₀ is saturation capacity (~5mg/g for typical AC) and Kₛ the SO₂ inhibition coefficient (~0.01 ppm⁻¹). SO₂ competes for active sites through: SO₂ + C* → C-SO₃ (Eₐ≈25 kJ/mol), reducing HgCl₂ adsorption sites by 30-50% at 200-500 ppm SO₂. The modified Yoon-Nelson model predicts τ (breakthrough time) = τ₀exp(-α[SO₂]), where α≈0.003 ppm⁻¹ for sulfur-poisoned carbons.",

From 280-580°C, Langmuir-Hinshelwood takes over where both Hg and HCl adsorb (θ_HCl≈0.3 monolayer at 300°C) before surface reaction: Hg* + Cl* → HgCl* (k=10¹²exp(-80kJ/mol/RT) s⁻¹). Above 680°C, both mechanisms coexist with homogeneous oxidation becoming significant. The transition is evidenced by Arrhenius plot discontinuities at 280°C (ΔEₐ=35→60 kJ/mol) and 580°C (ΔEₐ=60→15 kJ/mol). XPS studies confirm Fe-Cl surface complexes (708.5 eV binding energy) as active sites.",

For 90% removal, adsorption capacity q = qₘₐₓC/(1/K_L + C) = 800×10.8/(20+10.8) = 280 μg/g at C=10.8 μg/Nm³ (90% of inlet). Required sorbent = (40.9 g/hr × 0.9)/(280 μg/g × 10⁻⁶ kg/μg) = 131.5 kg/hr.

For typical 70% FGR, equilibrium concentration C = C₀/(1-R) = C₀/0.3 ≈ 3.3C₀. (2) Higher CO₂ partial pressure (70% vs 15% in air-firing) shifts Hg adsorption equilibria on fly ash (q=K_P·P_Hg/(1+ΣK_iP_i)) by competing for sites. (3) Elevated H₂O (25% vs 10%) inhibits Hg⁰ oxidation through OH radical quenching: OH + H₂O → H₂O₂ + H (k=2.1×10¹³ cm³/mol·s).
