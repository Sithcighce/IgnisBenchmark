    "standard_answer": "The cleavage of β-O-4 linkages during lignin depolymerization significantly impacts supercapacitor performance through two mechanisms: 1) Pore structure formation: β-O-4 bonds are the most reactive linkages (accounting for 50% of interunit connections), and their cleavage creates micro/mesopores during carbonization. This increases specific surface area (e.g., reaching 2300 m²/g with K₂CO₃ activation), enhancing electric double-layer capacitance. The reaction follows: Lignin-β-O-4-Lignin → Lignin-OH + Lignin=O + volatile fragments. 2) Redox activity: Cleavage exposes phenolic -OH groups that undergo reversible quinone/hydroquinone transitions (C₆H₄(OH)₂ ⇌ C₆H₄O₂ + 2H⁺ + 2e⁻), contributing pseudocapacitance. However, excessive cleavage below 250°C may reduce conductivity by preserving insulating aromatic clusters, while temperatures >700°C promote graphitization but lose oxygen functionalities.",

    "standard_answer": "The total capacity (Q_total) combines insertion (Q_insert) and pore-filling (Q_pore) contributions: 1) Insertion capacity: Using the interlayer spacing d=0.376 nm, the maximum Na⁺ intercalation follows the relation Q_insert = (F × x)/(3.6 × M_C), where x is the insertion coefficient (~0.3 for d=0.376 nm), F is Faraday's constant (96485 C/mol), M_C is carbon molar mass (12 g/mol). This yields Q_insert ≈ 120 mAh/g. 2) Pore-filling capacity: For micropore volume V_mic=72.6%, assuming Na metallic cluster formation (density ρ_Na=0.968 g/cm³): Q_pore = (V_mic × ρ_Na × F)/(3.6 × M_Na) ≈ 290 mAh/g, where M_Na=23 g/mol. Thus, Q_total = 120 + 290 = 410 mAh/g, closely matching experimental values of 392 mAh/g for L-1200 samples. Deviations arise from irreversible SEI formation and inaccessible pores.",

    "standard_answer": "Phenolic -OH groups in lignin GPEs function through three key mechanisms: 1) Li⁺ coordination: Each phenolic -OH forms transient complexes with PF₆⁻ anions via hydrogen bonding (C₆H₅O⁻···H⁺···PF₆⁻), increasing Li⁺ transference number to 0.85 by reducing anion mobility. This follows the equilibrium: C₆H₅OH + PF₆⁻ ⇌ C₆H₅O⁻···H⁺···PF₆⁻. 2) Thermal stability: The aromatic matrix provides radical scavenging via resonance-stabilized phenoxyl radicals (C₆H₅O·), delaying electrolyte decomposition up to 250°C. The stabilization energy is ~50 kJ/mol per phenolic unit. 3) SEI formation: During initial cycling, -OH groups decompose into Li₂O and polycarbonates (2C₆H₅OH + 2Li⁺ + 2e⁻ → 2Li₂O + C₁₂H₁₀O₂), creating a stable interface with activation energy ~60 kJ/mol.",

    "standard_answer": "The Damköhler number (Da) compares reaction rate to mass transport: Da = τ_reaction/τ_diffusion. For lignin pyrolysis: 1) Reaction timescale: τ_reaction = 1/k_eff, where k_eff = k₁ + k₂ = 1.2×10⁵ exp(-12000/T) + 3.4×10³ exp(-8000/T). At T=800K (527°C), k_eff ≈ 0.148 s⁻¹ → τ_reaction ≈ 6.76 s. 2) Diffusion timescale: τ_diffusion = L²/D, where L≈10 μm (char particle size), D≈10⁻⁷ m²/s (gas diffusivity)→ τ_diffusion ≈ 1 s. Thus, Da ≈ 6.76, indicating reaction-limited regime. The selectivity S = k₁/k₂ varies from 1.2 at 700K to 0.03 at 900K, showing β-O-4 cleavage dominates below 600K while condensation prevails above 800K.
