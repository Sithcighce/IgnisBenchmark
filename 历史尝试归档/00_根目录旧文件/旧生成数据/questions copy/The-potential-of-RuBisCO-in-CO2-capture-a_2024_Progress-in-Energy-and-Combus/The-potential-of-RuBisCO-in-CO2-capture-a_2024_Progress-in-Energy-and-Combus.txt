Carbon capture technology is currently considered one of the promising technologies to mitigate atmospheric
CO2 concentration. CO2 capture and utilization (CCU) captures anthropogenic waste CO2 and valorizes it into
useful products, supporting a circular transition pathway towards carbon neutrality. Unfortunately, the ther-
modynamic stability of CO2 requires a high-energy input for its conversion, resulting in processes with a net
positive carbon footprint. The incorporation of enzymes as biocatalysts in a process is attractive, as it facilitates
CO2 conversion under ambient conditions. In Nature, the conversion of CO2 into organic compounds is done
through photosynthesis, using an enzyme called ribulose-1,5-biphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO).
RuBisCO plays a central role in the natural assimilation of CO2, making it the enzyme chosen in Nature upon
which all life forms depend. However, the slow carboxylation rate of RuBisCO (1–10/s) has caused it to be
overlooked by faster enzymes such as carbonic anhydrase (CA), which has a carboxylation rate of 106/s. Despite
this, RuBisCO has a rate enhancement of 108 to 1010 times higher than CA. Thus, this review aims to take a closer
look at RuBisCO and examine its potential in CCU. Various aspects are considered, such as RuBisCO’s perfor-
mance in comparison to other enzymes, approaches to overcome its limitations, its applications and implications
in CCU, the valuable chemicals that can be derived from it, recent developments in RuBisCO-integrated pro-
cesses, and its economic and environmental considerations. Through this, RuBisCO’s potential as one of the key
enzymes in CCU will be explored.

1. Introduction

Increased awareness of the global impacts caused by human activ-
ities has launched ambitious initiatives to promote a more sustainable
lifestyle. The most prominent are the 17 sustainability development
goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which
aims to achieve specific goals related to climate, energy, water, urban-
ization, transport, gender, etc., that are identified as critical for a sus-
tainable future [1]. Global warming, tackled by SDGX, threatens the
consecution of other goals, since it transversally affects aspects related
to water scarcity, equality, safety, and poverty, among others. The in-
crease in atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) concentration, especially
CO2, is caused by anthropogenic emissions, where 64 % (38 ± 3 Pg
CO2-eq) of the total global GHG emissions in 2019 was attributed to CO2
from fossil fuels and industry alone; 167 % higher than in 1990 (15 Pg
CO2-eq) [2]. The continued increase in CO2 concentration at this rate
has been projected to result in a global average temperature exceeding
the 2
C target in the 21st century [2]. On the other hand, the heavy
dependence on natural resources has resulted in their consumption at an
unsustainable rate [3]. Therefore, the circular economy model has
recently been proposed as a building block for the European Green Deal
[4–6], to minimize human impact and resource dependence, in line with
the SDGs [1]. By prolonging the lifetime of products, the dependence on
limited resources, diversity losses, land use, waste generation, and CO2
emission can be minimized, among others [4]. Considering that
anthropogenic waste CO2 can be used as a renewable carbon source for
the synthesis of key chemical intermediates, a process known as CO2
capture and utilization (CCU), designing a CCU system that supports the
circular economy is therefore a promising approach to deal with both
climate and resource depletion issues.

◦

Carbon capture technology has been identified as a key technology to

mitigate atmospheric CO2 levels [7]. Most of the captured CO2 (95 %) is
sent for storage in geological reservoirs (CO2 capture and storage), while
the rest is used for CCU [8,9]. Although at the moment CCU comprises
only a small fraction of carbon capture technology, it is an important
technology as CCU aligns with the circular economy model, allowing
simultaneous reduction on fossil fuel feedstock dependence and on GHG
emissions [10]. However, CO2 is a very stable molecule because its
carbon is in its highest oxidation state [11,12]. Converting CO2 to high
value compounds is a challenge as, in this state, carbon is not susceptible
to nucleophilic attack due to its poor electron affinity [12]. Considering
that the dissociation energy to break the C=O bond in CO2 is at least 750
intensive energy input is therefore required for the
kJ/mol [13],
large-scale conversion of CO2 [11–13]. Consequently, there are limited
pathways available for efficient conversion of CO2 into useful chemicals
[8], with economics being the main obstacle to its large-scale imple-
mentation [14,15]. Combined with the limited economic incentives for
CO2 conversion [8], the market for pure CO2 is significantly smaller than
the amount of waste CO2 being released into the atmosphere (0.23 Pg
CO2/yr demanded [16] vs. 38 ± 3 Pg CO2/yr emitted [2] in 2019), and it
is expected to remain relatively small in the near future [17]. Therefore,
harnessing the potential of CCU for a circular economy requires devel-
oping more efficient CO2 conversion pathways [16], notably direct
conversion of CO2 into fine chemicals to justify the cost of the CO2
conversion process, or into high molecular weight organic compounds to
store CO2 long term [9,18].

Currently, several pathways for CO2 conversion have been devel-
oped, namely electrochemical, photocatalytic, thermal, biochemical,
and chemo-enzymatic [14]. Among these pathways, the biochemical
and chemo-enzymatic approach have been viewed favorably due to its
relatively mild reaction condition requirements, the use of environ-
mentally benign substances, and the possibility of producing valuable

industrial organic compounds useful for the chemical and pharmaceu-
tical industries [14]. However, biomolecules are unstable and expen-
sive, driving efforts towards the development of suitable immobilization
strategies to improve their stability and reusability under in-vitro con-
ditions. The majority of such efforts have focused on enzymes with fast
carboxylation rates; notably carbon monoxide dehydrogenase, formate
dehydrogenase, hydrogenase, and nitrogenase [19]. Although such fast
enzymes exhibit high compatibility with existing industrial processes (e.
g., steam methane reforming) due to their ability to use CO, CO2, H2, and
N2 gas [19], products produced are typically of bulk chemical quality
that may not justify the cost of enzyme use. The use of microorganisms
and
and
as
photocatalytic-biological (or typically known as artificial photosyn-
thesis), has shown some initial results in the conversion of CO2 into
valuable and more complex industrial organic compounds (C2+) [15].
However, as with the chemo-enzymatic approach, its performance is
currently limited to enzyme and microbial stability under operating
conditions, while the electron transfer efficiency of the electrochemical
and photocatalytic part still needs to be improved to justify economics
[15]. Therefore, more studies exploring alternative biochemical and
chemo-enzymatic conversion of CO2 into valuable organic chemicals are
needed to support their wide-scale implementation.

In Nature, the conversion of CO2 into complex organic compounds
takes place via photosynthesis, where its rate-limiting step is catalyzed
by RuBisCO, responsible for the carboxylation step of the Calvin-Benson-
Bassham (CBB) pathway. The primary function of RuBisCO is to catalyze
the carboxylation of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RUBP), a five-carbon
compound, with CO2 to form two molecules of 3-phosphoglyceric acid
(3-PGA), which are further metabolized to produce complex organic
compounds such as glucose [20–22]. RuBisCO is the most abundant
enzyme in Nature [23], accounting for at least 90 % of the assimilation
of CO2 by Nature [23–25]. In this sense, RuBisCO is said to be chosen as
the main enzyme on which all forms of life depend on [23,24]. However,
RuBisCO’s catalytic activity is not perfectly selective for CO2. It also
catalyzes a competing reaction known as photorespiration, in which
RUBP reacts with oxygen (O2) instead of CO2, to produce 2-phosphogly-
colate (2-PG) and other metabolites [25,26]. Photorespiration consumes
energy and reduces the efficiency of carbon fixation, particularly under
high temperature and high oxygen conditions [20].

The limitations of RuBisCO stem from its evolutionary history and
structural characteristics [24]. It has a relatively low catalytic efficiency,
meaning that it operates at a slower rate compared to that of other en-
zymes, and its active site can also catalyze the oxygenation reaction,
leading to the wasteful photorespiration process. Furthermore, RuBisCO
evolved in an atmosphere with higher CO2 concentrations, so its affinity
for CO2 is relatively low under current atmospheric CO2 levels [24].
These limitations pose significant challenges to plant productivity,
especially under environmental conditions where photorespiration is
favored [24,27]. Efforts are ongoing to improve RuBisCO’s efficiency
and selectivity through genetic engineering, directed evolution, and
other biotechnological approaches, aiming to enhance photosynthetic
efficiency and crop productivity for sustainable agriculture and carbon
sequestration efforts [27].

Due to RuBisCO’s central role in photosynthesis, it is widely studied
in agriculture and biological sciences. Recent reviews on RuBisCO have
focused heavily on the characterization of RuBisCO variants in less
studied organisms [28], the design of climate-resistant crops by under-
standing its role and influence [29–31], or the development of various
engineering strategies to enhance its catalytic properties or heterologous
expression [32]. On the other hand, recent reviews on CO2 capture and
conversion focused heavily on faster enzymes, notably CA [19], as well
as microbial cells [15], only briefly discussing RuBisCO in the context of
photosynthesis and highlighting its catalytic limitations [33,34].
Althgouh RuBisCO has a relatively poor catalytic properties, it has the
capacity to directly convert CO2 into a C3 organic acid, potentially
paving an alternative pathway for the high valorization of CO2.

Therefore, this review aims to bridge the current knowledge gap by
providing an in-depth analysis of RuBisCO, evaluating its unique po-
tential as a biocatalyst for the capture and conversion of CO2 to complex
organic compounds. In addition, it explores the critical economic and
environmental considerations necessary to scale up this process to an
industrial
level, highlighting the impact on sustainable carbon
management.

Specifically, this review explores various enzymatic CO2 conversion
pathways, with the aim of identifying the most efficient pathway for CO2
conversion into high molecular weight organic compounds (Section 2).
The kinetic properties of RuBisCO are also reviewed and compared with
other enzymes to understand why RuBisCO is the enzyme chosen in
Nature (Section 3). The current efforts to improve RuBisCO performance
are then discussed (Section 4), followed by its applications and impli-
cations in the CCU (Section 5). The potential of its carboxylation prod-
uct, 3-PGA, is then reviewed, mapping possible conversion pathways to
produce high-value compounds (Section 6). Various strategies for
cofactor regeneration are then briefly illustrated (Section 7). Finally, the
future scenario of RuBisCO in CCU is illustrated by describing efforts in
the development of RuBisCO-integrated processes that perform artificial
photosynthesis (Section 8), as well as by discussing various economic
and environmental aspects that must be considered for its industrial-
scale application (Section 9). Therefore, in this review, the potential of
RuBisCO in CCU is discussed, in the hope of shedding light on its po-
tential to be one of the key enzymes for high-value CO2 conversion.

There are four main CO2 conversion strategies under research [35]:
chemical, photochemical, electrochemical, and enzymatic pathways
[35]. The enzymatic strategy has been identified as the most promising,
and
mainly
region/chemico-selectivity of the enzyme [36]. This makes it possible to
implement highly selective and specific reactions under room conditions
using enzymes, which is currently not possible with other strategies
[35]. Furthermore, enzymes are bio-derived and widely available in
Nature, being responsible for catalyzing numerous important reactions
such as photosynthesis [25]. On the other hand, synthetic biology tools,
such as enzyme and metabolic engineering, have greatly expanded the
repertoire of enzymatic reactions by engineering enzymes with newly
(new-to-nature) [26,37–40] and engineering
exhibited properties
metabolic pathways with higher efficiency for the targeted synthesis of
high-value compounds [41–45]. Thus, the enzymatic CO2 conversion
strategy is a rapidly expanding domain showing great potential. The
enzymatic conversion of CO2 can be carried out in two ways [35,46]. For
the sake of clarity in this review, these will be referred to as circular and

linear CO2 conversion pathways, as illustrated in Fig. 1.

2.1. Circular CO2 conversion pathways

(cid:0)
In the circular CO2 conversion pathway, CO2 and/or HCO3

act(s) as
co-substrate(s) fixed to a main substrate in the presence of a cofactor

(optional) to produce an organic intermediate. This intermediate then
undergoes further cascade reactions, ultimately regenerating the main
substrate and forming a closed loop. The circular pathway can be clas-
sified as natural or synthetic. The natural circular pathway is practiced
in Nature, and is used to assimilate atmospheric CO2 into biomass [11,
46,47]. Hence, this pathway is exhibited by all autotrophic organisms

Fig. 2. The circular CO2 conversion pathway can be classified into natural circular pathways (a), and synthetic circular pathways (b). There are six major natural
circular pathways: the CBB pathway, the rAc-CoA pathway, the rTCA pathway, the 3-HP pathway, the 3-HP/4-HB pathway, and the DC/4-HB pathway [35,41,46].
On the other hand, examples of recently developed synthetic pathways are the CETCH [64] pathway and the Tartronyl-CoA shunt [40]. For the natural circular

six
the
natural
identified:
the reductive acetyl-CoA
Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) pathway,
(rAc-CoA) pathway, the reductive tricarboxylic acid (rTCA) pathway,
the 3-hydroxypropionate (3-HP) pathway, the 3-hydroxypropionate/4--
hydroxybutyrate
dicarbox
ylate/4-hydroxybutyrate (DC/4-HB) pathway [25,41,46–50]. In these
pathways, carboxylases are used to fix CO2 to the main substrate, except
for the rAc-CoA pathway, which uses dehydrogenase and synthase to
convert CO2 to acetyl-CoA [25]. Reviews that describe these major
pathways in detail can be found in Refs. [25,41,46–50], while a table
summarizing the different main substrates,
the
CO2-fixation product, the CO2-assimilating enzymes, and the relevant
organism(s) where the pathway is practiced, is shown in Table 1 below.
The preference of an organism for a specific pathway is strongly
dependent on its physiology and ecological niche [48]. Physiological
factors such as the energy requirements (i.e., the mole of ATP needed per
mole of CO2 fixed), the nature of the reducing equivalents (e.g., NAD(P)
H or ferredoxin), the oxygen (in)sensitivity of the pathways, and the
need for special cofactors or metals, are considered as determinants of
pathway preference [25]. For example, green sulfur bacteria possess a
FeS photosynthetic reaction center capable of reducing ferredoxin [61]
and adaptation to low light intensities [62], which makes the supply of
ATP a growth limiting factor. Among the six pathways, the rTCA has
been chosen as its CO2 metabolic pathway, as rTCA uses reduced
ferredoxin and NAD(P)H as electron donors, which allows low ATP
supply requirements [48]. Thus, no superior natural CO2 metabolic
pathway can be considered in-vivo as these pathways are the result of an
optimized evolutionary adaptation of the organism [25]. Indeed, the
CBB pathway is the most adapted in Nature, being responsible for at
least 90 % of the annual fixation of CO2 in Nature (1014 kg CO2 per
pyruvate [23]) [23–25]. However, the CCB pathway is the second most
energetically demanding pathway (2.3 mol ATP/mol CO2), with
RuBisCO having the second lowest carboxylation efficiency (kcat,c/Kc)
among autotrophic carboxylases (complete data can be found in Refs.
[25,50,63]). In comparison, the rTCA is responsible for only <10 %
carbon fixation in Nature, despite being the most energetically efficient
(~0.6 mol ATP/mol CO2 for pyruvate) [25].

is

Recently, retrobiosynthesis has been used to design metabolically
efficient pathways for the production of useful organic compounds [64].
The most notable synthetic pathway developed so far
the
crotonyl-CoA/ethylmalonyl-CoA/hydroxybutyryl-CoA (CETCH) which
converts CO2 to malate as the final product [64]. Malate is widely used
in the food and medical industry as an acidulant, flavor enhancer, pre-
cursor for food supplements, medications, etc. [65]. The CETCH is
comprised of 13 core reactions, catalyzed by 17 enzymes from nine
different organisms in all domains of life. The realized CETCH pathway
has better energy efficiency (6.5 ATP equiv. per CO2) than the CBB (6.8
ATP equiv./CO2), 3-HP (6.8 ATP equiv./CO2) and 3-HP/4-HB (8.0 ATP
equiv./CO2) pathways in terms of 3-PGA as the normalized CO2-fixation
product [64]. Furthermore, the CETCH has a slightly better fixation rate
(5 nmol CO2 min/mg protein) compared to that of the CBB pathway
measured in cell extracts (1–3 nmol CO2 min/mg protein) [66]. Despite
this slightly better performance, it is important to note that the CETCH
pathway was developed and evaluated under in-vitro conditions, which
is simplistic compared to in-vivo cellular conditions [64].

On the other hand, synthetic bypasses for the CBB pathway have also
been developed via retrobiosynthesis [40]. Sometimes, RuBisCO reacts
with O2 instead of CO2 during the fixation step, producing 3-PGA and a
harmful side-product 2-PG [67]. As 2-PG is toxic, it undergoes the
photorespiratory glycolate pathway for elimination, consuming ATP
and NADH to produce CO2 and NH3 [68]. Therefore, the photo-
respiratory pathway competes with the CBB pathway and has been
considered to reduce the carbon fixation efficiency of RuBisCO, with an
estimated 30 % loss in carbon fixation [69]. Among recently developed
theoretical bypasses [40], the Tartonyl-CoA (TrCoA) stunt was the only

strate to produce useful compounds [35,71]. The conversion of CO2 to formate

pathway to directly rely on the carbon fixation step of the CBB pathway,
resulting in a ~60 % increase in CO2 fixation relative to the
non-bypassed photorespiration process, the highest among the devel-
oped bypasses [40]. While sharing a strong similarity with the tartronic
semialdehyde photorespiratory pathway in cyanobacteria where 2-PG is
recycled back into the CBB pathway [70], the TrCoA pathway differs
such that no CO2 is released in the process [40], as is the case in the
tartronic semialdehyde pathway. In particular, a new-to-nature pathway
was designed for the reduction of glycolate to glycoaldehyde, such that
(cid:0)
HCO3
is used as substrate, resulting in carbon conservation during
photorespiratory bypass [40].

However, the TrCoA pathway involves enzymes that are not natu-
rally found in Nature [26,40]. Recently, new-to-nature enzymes were
developed to support the TrCoA pathway [26]. The key enzyme,
glycolyl-CoA carboxylase, was theoretically predicted to increase the
kcat,c/Kc of the photorespiration process by 150 % [26]. More efforts are
still needed to improve the activities of the supporting enzymes that
participate in the TrCoA pathway and enhance its metabolic flux [26].
An illustrated summary of the different circular CO2 conversion path-
ways discussed in this review is shown in Fig. 2 below.

2.2. Linear CO2 conversion pathways

The linear CO2 conversion pathway uses CO2 and sometimes cofactor
(s) to produce compounds either for direct use or as intermediates to
produce useful end-products. Hence, the linear pathway can be one of
the reactions that comprise part of the circular pathway, whose inter-
mediate is redirected for other uses and does not lead to the regeneration
of the main substrate (e.g., CO2 to formate, which also froms part of the
rAc-CoA pathway [46]). In addition, the linear conversion can be best
categorized in two groups: pathways which directly use CO2 as main
substrate (direct linear pathway), and pathways which use CO2 as
co-substrate (indirect linear pathway). Recent efforts have focused on
direct linear pathways due to the relative simplicity of substrate and
cofactor requirements compared to those of circular pathways. In
(cid:0)
particular, the conversion of CO2 to HCO3
using CA (in reality, CA
(cid:0)
catalyzes the interconversion of CO2 and HCO3
, Section 3.2), CO2 to
carbon monoxide using carbon monoxide dehydrogenase, CO2 to
methanol using formate dehydrogenase, formaldehyde dehydrogenase
and methanol dehydrogenase, and CO2 to methane using remodeled
nitrogenase of Rhodopseudomonas palustris [35,71,72] has been focused
(cid:0)
(Fig. 3). Although the conversion of CO2 to HCO3
has been popular due
to the extremely high turn-over rate of CA [73], the conversion of CO2 to
methanol is more valuable, as methanol can be used as a building block
for the synthesis of numerous valuable chemicals and as a clean-burning

fuel with a high-octane number [74]. However, the production of
methanol using multiple dehydrogenases is currently limited by several
factors, such as a lack of suitable and well-characterized enzymes, a high
cost due to the difficulties of enzyme recovery and reuse, the need for
expensive cofactors, a limited capture capacity under low partial CO2
pressure, a low solubility of CO2 in water, and a low yield of CO2 con-
version [75,76].

The indirect linear CO2 conversion pathway has also recently gained
increasing attention due to the possibility of converting CO2 into com-
plex organic compounds, such as carboxylic acid and carboxylate de-
rivatives (Fig. 4). Typically, decarboxylases are employed in this
pathway and operated in its reverse reaction to allow CO2 fixation [11,
77]. The substrate groups utilized in this pathway are phenolic com-
pounds, heteroaromatic compounds, (non)phenolic aromatic com-
pounds, and aliphatic compounds [77] (Fig. 4). Although the
carboxylation reaction of these substrates is highly unfavored due to
(cid:0)
their requirement for excess carbon substrate (CO2 or HCO3
) and, most
often for cofactors, decarboxylases are attractive due to their wide
substrate tolerance and receptiveness to modifications [11,77]. There-
fore, different classes of decarboxylases can utilize different substrate
groups, as shown in Fig. 4. A recent review focusing on synthetic ap-
plications of decarboxylases can be found in Ref. [77], while a review
focusing on mechanistic and structural aspects can be found in Ref. [11].
Despite their advantages, most studies exploring this pathway have only
(cid:0)
solutions or high CO2 pressure [77–81]. For this to
used saturated HCO3
be more widely applicable, more studies need to be performed in
(cid:0)
non-saturated HCO3
solutions or low CO2 pressure conditions. Devel-
opment of ATP-cofactor recycling systems is also needed to be
cost-effective.

In summary, numerous enzymatic CO2 fixation pathways have
recently been explored for CCU applications [40,41,46,47,64]. Such
pathways may involve either a substrate regeneration resulting in the
closed-loop pathway, as in the circular pathway, or a production of
compounds for immediate application, as in the linear pathway. Among
the natural circular pathways, the CBB pathway has been chosen by
Nature for photosynthesis despite being one of the least efficient path-
ways [25]. Although more efficient synthetic pathways have been
developed [40,64], this requires the use of sophisticated metabolic en-
gineering tools to genetically modify numerous enzymes to exhibit the
desired conceptualized reaction. Furthermore,
the performance
improvement obtained with synthetic pathways is not significant rela-
tive to the CBB pathway (i.e., CETCH pathway [64]). On the other hand,
linear direct conversion pathways have been more popular than cyclic
pathways in recent years, due to their relatively simpler substrate re-
quirements [35,71] and reaction steps. However, the resulting products
are lower in molecular weight with limited value. The linear indirect
conversion pathways produce higher molecular weight organic com-
pounds such as carboxylic acid and carboxylate derivatives, but require
complex substrates and, most often, cofactors [11,77]. Considering all of
these, the CBB pathway offers to be the most attractive pathway to
develop for high-value CO2 conversion from a sustainable point-of-view
as it allows for substrate regeneration while producing a valuable
organic product, 3-PGA [25,46,47]. As illustrated later in Section 8,
3-PGA can be used to produce numerous useful organic compounds via
various metabolic pathways. Therefore, the development of the CBB
pathway by improving its rate limiting step (carbon fixation) could be an
interesting direction in the future. The next sections focus on the enzyme
ribulose 1,5-biphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase or RuBisCO, a key
enzyme in the CBB pathway, to show the current achievements already
obtained with this intriguing enzyme.

3. RuBisCO

Autotrophic organisms utilize photosynthesis for long-term storage
of light energy into chemical energy in the form of glucose [25,51].
Photosynthesis takes place in two stages [51]: the first stage comprises

light-dependent
reactions, while the second stage consists of a
light-independent reaction. During the first stage, light energy from the
sun is stored in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and nicotin-
amide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), which are then used to produce
glucose during the second stage [51]. During the second stage, CO2
participates in the CBB pathway to produce a three-carbon sugar
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), which serves as a key intermediate
in numerous central metabolisms to produce various building blocks of
life such as nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, glucose, cellulose, etc. [51]. As
such, the light-independent stage is synonymous with the CBB pathway.
The CBB pathway is characterized by three major steps [51]: fixation,
reduction, and regeneration. RuBisCO catalyzes CO2 fixation in RUBP to
produce an organic sugar 3-PGA [11,20,21], which then undergoes
multiple reduction reactions with ATP and NADH to produce G3P [51].
Three turns of the CBB pathway are needed to produce one molecule of
G3P that exits the pathway for glucose synthesis, while the remaining
five are used to regenerate RUBP as the final step [68]. Sometimes,
RuBisCO reacts with O2 instead of CO2, resulting in a decrease in its
carbon fixation efficiency, as will be further discussed in Sections 3.1
and 3.2 below.

3.1. Structure and function of RuBisCO

RuBisCO is a multimeric enzyme comprised of two different types of
subunits, the large (L, 50–55 kDa), and small (S, 12–18 kDa) subunits
[82]. Although the primary structure differs between RuBisCO, the
secondary structure of its L-subunit remains consistent across the
evolutionary branches of the enzyme’s phylogenetic tree [20]. The
molecular structure of RuBisCO [20] consists of a dimeric complex of
L-subunits, whose amino acid sequences are anti-parallel to each other.
The C-terminal segment of one L-subunit shapes an important tertiary
structure known as the triose phosphate isomerase (TIM) barrel, which
forms part of the active sites. Meanwhile, the N-terminal domain of the
anti-parallel subunit envelopes the TIM barrel, completing the enzyme’s
active sites. Although the S-subunit does not participate directly in the
formation of RuBisCO’s active site, it has been proposed to play a
structural role in stabilizing RuBisCO’s quaternary structure, as well as a
functional role in affecting RuBisCO’s kinetic properties [82]. Indeed,
depending on the arrangement and presence of the S-subunit, four
different quaternary RuBisCO isoforms have been identified in Nature
[82]. Interestingly, the relationship between different RuBisCO isoforms
could be explained in terms of
its historical emergence, where
RuBisCO-like proteins (isoform IV) have been proposed to be the origin
of isoforms II, III and modern-day RuBisCO (isoform I), and sophisti-
cated structures have been developed to cope with decreasing CO2
concentration in modern times [24].

The catalytic mechanism of RuBisCO [20,83] begins with enzyme
activation, where the amino acid residue Lys201 undergoes a carba-
mylation reaction with CO2 at the active site. The Mg2+
binds to the
carbamylated-Lsy201, stabilizing the complex and completing the
enzyme activation step. Once in the activated state, RuBisCO maintains
an “open” conformation, exposing the carbamylated-Lsy201-Mg2+
complex to the solvent, and catalysis starts. The catalytic phase is a
stepwise mechanism comprised of four steps: enolization, carboxylation,
or oxygenation, hydration, and cleavage. During enolization, RUBP
tightly binds to the activated RuBisCO, causing a shift towards a “close”
conformation, where RuBisCO can then react with either CO2 or O2.
Carboxylation results in an enzyme-substrate complex whose hydration
and cleavage result in the formation of two 3-PGA. On the other hand,
oxygenation follows analogous steps that lead to the formation of one
3-PGA and one 2-PG. RuBisCO’s reaction with O2 instead of CO2 has
earned it a reputation as an inefficient enzyme (low kcat,c/Kc), known for
its canonical trade-off between carboxylation rate (kcat,c) and specificity
(SC/O) [84,85]. The origin of such properties has been explained from a
historical perspective, where RuBisCO was hypothesized to evolve
before the first great oxygenation event [24].

K.D. Cocon and P. Luis

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 105 (2024) 101184

The absence of O2 during such era meant that RuBisCO catalysis was
not constrained by O2 [24]. As atmospheric O2 concentration increased
to modern-day levels, RuBisCO needed to choose between the two very
similar compounds, CO2 and O2 [24]. As oxygenation produces 2-PG,
which is toxic to plants and requires recycling through an energeti-
cally demanding process called photorespiration (30 % photosynthetic
energy [86]), RuBisCO developed strategies to improve its CO2 selec-
tivity to ensure proliferation of life [24]. Unfortunately, improving
selectivity in enzymes requires tighter binding of the desired compound,
which inevitably slows down subsequent catalysis [87]. For RuBisCO to
have strong CO2 binding (high kcat,c/Kc), its hydration and cleavage
steps must be compromised (low kcat,c) [84]. This kcat,c – Kc coupling
makes engineering the selective yet fast RuBisCO impossible without
compromise [84]. Other mechanistic limitations such as the dependence
of both carboxylation and oxygenation on the enolization of RUBP make
it impossible to increase carboxylation without increasing oxygenation
[84]. Furthermore, the occurrence of all complex reactions at a single

active site [84] and the high entropic cost of the conformational changes
during activation and catalysis [20] may have also contributed to the
low kcat,c. As a result, the catalytic properties of modern-day RuBisCO
have been believed to be already optimized with a relatively low kcat,c
but sufficiently high kcat,c/Kc efficiency [88]; although several recent
studies have contested this idea [83,84,89].

3.2. CO2 concentrating mechanisms

The increase in oxygen concentration in the atmosphere with time
caused a reduction in the kcat,c/Kc of RuBisCO due to its increased
oxygenation reaction [24]. Therefore, organisms using RuBisCO devel-
oped CO2 concentrating mechanisms (CCM) to maintain CO2 fixation
efficiency in the presence of O2 [24]. The development of CCM is
believed to occur in two stages, starting with the emergence of
condensing proteins that allowed the formation of RuBisCO condensates
(also called pyrenoids) present in the chloroplast of many algae today

Fig. 5. Comparison of RuBisCO’s catalytic rate (kcat, a) and catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM, b) relative to enzymes registered in the BRENDA data base, as well as other
major carboxylases (c), which shows that RuBisCO is not especially slow, rather it is average, and has higher rate enhancement than CA (d). Fig. 4 (a), (b), and (d)
were adapted from Ref. [95], while (c) was adapted from Ref. [64].

[90]. Pyrenoids are situated around structures called thylakoids that
(cid:0)
supply CO2 in the form of HCO3
. Due to condensation-induced diffusion
limitations and the presence of special polysaccharide structures that act
as a CO2 diffusion barrier, a CO2-saturated microenvironment is main-
tained near RuBisCO, minimizing its oxygenation reaction [91]. The
acquisition of a bacterial microcompartment protein shell marked the
second stage of CCM evolution,
leading to specialized polyhedral
structures called carboxysomes, which are typically found in cyano-
bacteria [90]. Carboxysomes consist of integrated uptake systems that
(cid:0)
allow the free passage of HCO3
, RUBP, and 3-PGA, but limit the diffu-
sion of CO2 efflux and O2 influx, resulting in a CO2-saturated microen-
vironment near RuBisCO [92].
In addition to these specialized
structures, a crucial component in both CCMs is the colocalization of CA
with RuBisCO within diffusion limited structures [90,93].

+
(cid:0) + H

CA plays a key role in maintaining a steady-state equilibrium be-
(cid:0)
tween HCO3
and CO2 near RuBisCO at sufficiently fast rates, by cata-
lyzing their interconversion: CO2 + H2O ⇌ HCO3
[90,94]. As pH
(cid:0)
drives the equilibrium composition of HCO3
and CO2, maintaining an
optimal pH is necessary to maintain the CO2 saturation of RuBisCO [94].
Under this condition, the oxygenation reaction is competitively inhibi-
ted [92], reducing the pressure for RuBisCO to have high SC/O. This
relaxation in SC/O under a saturated environment allows carboxylation
to proceed near the maximum rate (kcat,c – Kc coupling) with maximum
efficiency (kcat,c/Kc) [84]. Furthermore, pH dictates the enzyme’s
conformation needed for proper enzyme functioning [92]. Indeed, while
acidic pH < 8.0 increases CO2 equilibrium concentration, increasing the
acidity negatively affects RuBisCO kinetics [94]. On the other hand, at
pH > 8.5, the equilibrium concentration of CO2 decreases, leading to the

loss of RuBisCO’s maximum carboxylation rate [94]. Since an equilib-
rium favoring CO2 generation is energetically costly due to the use of
(cid:0)
:CO2 equilib-
transporters to actively input HCO3
rium concentration is maintained to minimize the total cost of CO2
fixation [94]. Thus, pH regulation is important to ensure efficient cell
functioning, in addition to maintaining the enzyme conformation for
proper enzyme functioning.

3.3. Kinetic properties

At first glance, RuBisCO has an unremarkable kinetic property and
selectivity that makes it easily overlooked over fast and highly selective
enzymes, notably CA, for CCU applications. This had greatly limited
RuBisCO’s application under in-vitro conditions, although its central role
in photosynthesis had maintained its
importance. More studies
exploring different strategies using RuBisCO are needed to evaluate its
true potential in CCU. Comparison of RuBisCO’s kinetic properties
relative to other enzymes shows conflicting results, depending on which
property is considered. When compared in terms of catalytic rate (kcat),
RuBisCO generally lies below the average values reported for known
enzymes [95] (Fig. 5 (a)). However, when compared in terms of catalytic
efficiency (kcat/KM), RuBisCO lies around the average of the currently
known enzymes (Fig. 5 (b)) but has the third highest efficiency relative
to the other 8 major carboxylase classes [64] (Fig. 5 (c)). However,
comparing enzymes based on kcat and kcat/KM can be misleading and
does not provide a correct insight into the enzyme’s performance [95]. A
less commonly mentioned property, called rate enhancement, has been
argued to provide a better measure of enzyme performance [96]. Rate

enhancement (kcat/knoncat) is defined as the ratio between the catalyzed
(kcat) and non-catalyzed first-order rate constants (knoncat) of the reac-
tion [96]. A diffusion-limited enzyme, CA, was dubbed a “super--
enzyme” due to its very fast kinetics [73]. However, this enzyme
(cid:0)
catalyzes CO2 hydration into HCO3
, which occurs spontaneously with a
half-time of 5 s under noncatalyzed conditions [96]. Regarding
RuBisCO, although the formation of RUBP has an unknown knoncat due to
RUBP’s instability in the solution [95], the application of theoretical
calculations by Zhan et al. [97] for the knoncat of RUBP reveals that
RuBisCO has a 108–1010 times higher rate enhancement than CA [95]
(Fig. 5 (d)), despite having at least 105 times lower kinetic rate [73] and
~103 times lower carboxylating efficiency [96]. This highlights that rate
enhancement is an important property when evaluating an enzyme’s
potential for CCU application, as it offers a more holistic view of the
enzyme’s performance. In this case, the rate enhancement has shown
that RuBisCO indeed shows potential despite its apparently slow ki-
netics, at least when compared to CA. Comparison with respect to other
enzymes currently studied for CCU applications remains to be made to
see where RuBisCO truly lies. To make this possible, future efforts are
needed to develop techniques to measure the knoncat of different sub-
strates involved in CCU and compare their rate enhancements with
RuBisCO’s.

The kinetic imperfection of RuBisCO has been mainly attributed to
its active-site chemistry and its metabolic regulation [95]. During
carboxylation, RuBisCO undergoes multiple conformational changes to
accommodate at least three different transition states [20]. As these
reactions are not independent of each other, RuBisCO must prioritize its
structural integrity (preserve all active site residues) [98] to ensure
correct folding during all transitions. This means that during evolution,
mutations that enhance kcat,c/Kc but compromise stability were not
in RuBisCO’s evolution due to its
selected [95]. This constraint
active-site chemistry ultimately led to a trade-off between its stability
and activity [99]. On the other hand, RuBisCO is the rate-limiting step of
the CBB pathway [20]. The maximum kcat,c of rate-limiting enzymes is
tightly regulated in-vivo to match the maximal flux of the pathway [95].
Nevertheless, despite the tight regulation of RuBisCO’s maximum kcat,c
[84], its kcat,c/Kc cannot be considered poor. Indeed, the kcat,c/Kc of
RuBisCO is comparable to that of observed in high-flux metabolic
pathways [95]. Furthermore, the enhancement of both RuBisCO kinetics
and selectivity is possible using synthetic biology tools despite its
evolutionary constraint [83], as discussed in Section 4.

4. Addressing RubisCO limitations

4.1. Enzyme engineering

Enzyme engineering techniques allow the synthesis of enzymes with
improved catalytic efficiency and selectivity through the alteration of
the enzyme structure [100–102]. There are two techniques commonly
used in RuBisCO engineering: directed evolution and rational engi-
neering [42] (Fig. 6). In directed evolution, structural changes are
induced through random mutation by repeated natural evolution [103,
104]. This generates a library of variants that are screened for im-
provements in desired traits and then subjected to gene amplification
[103,104]. The rational engineering approach relies on site-directed
mutagenesis to induce specific and deliberate mutations [101]. This
generally results in significantly lower screening efforts compared to
directed evolution [105]. However, the rational engineering approach
requires a thorough understanding of the enzyme’s three-dimensional
structure, and the link between structure and the exhibited property is
not always as predicted [101,105].

Successful attempts to improve RuBisCO catalysis through rational
engineering have only recently been achieved [106–110]. The focus of
RuBisCO rational engineering has been on using known crystal struc-
tures as blueprints to induce specific desired mutations. Zeng et al. [107]
used the crystal structure information of Thermococcus kodakaraensis

RuBisCO type III to replace the weak non-covalent interactions between
the RuBisCO molecules with a stronger and directional metal coordi-
nation interaction. This allowed the formation of a stacked RuBisCO
nano-assembly in an aqueous solution, whose spatial arrangement
allowed for increased structural stability and substrate channeling be-
tween active sites [107]. Such nano-assembly has been observed in
cyanobacteria, where self-assembled RuBisCO with improved carbox-
ylation rates are encapsulated in a microcompartment called carbox-
ysome [111]. The application of a previously developed rational
engineering technique [112] led to improvements in activity (40 %),
C, 30 min), and
turnover rate (100 %), thermal stability (124 % at 75
reusability (91 % after 10 cycles) relative to wild type.

◦

Another approach used in rational engineering was to use well-
known RuBisCO crystal structures, notably those from spinach (Iso-
form I) and Rhodospirillum rubrum (Isoform II), as a starting basis to
rationally engineer unknown RuBisCO mutants for desired properties.
Fujihashi et al. [108] referred to the spinach RuBisCO structure and
amino acid sequence to rationally engineer four RuBisCO mutants of
Thermococcus kodakarensis. An improvement in the carboxylase activity
was obtained relative to wild type (24.2 % in-vitro, 49.8 % in-vivo) with
the T289D mutant. Deriving the crystal structure of the resulting T289D
mutant provided insight into the underlying mechanism for its improved
activity, revealing differences in the mechanisms with other mutants.
This led the group to combine mutants with different mechanisms that
resulted in even higher activity relative to wild type at ambient tem-
perature (60 % in-vitro and 100 % in-vivo). Similarly, Satagopan et al.
[110] used the crystal structure of Rhodospirillum rubrum as a basis for
understanding the structure – performance relationship of amino acid
residues in Synechococcus cyanobacteria. From these, mutations were
identified that led to better CO2-dependent growth capacities compared
to wild type (1.8–2.6-fold increase in carboxylating efficiency).

On the other hand, the directed evolution of RuBisCO has focused on
the development of screening techniques with a greater chance of
selecting a true-positive mutated strain [106,113,114]. Indeed, the
success in using directed evolution is dictated by the reliability of the
screening technique applied to capture the desired phenotype [104,
115]. Wilson et al. [106] applied the high-throughput RuBisCO-de-
pendent E. coli (RDE) screening technique to enhance the carboxylation
properties of RuBisCO isoform III from the archaea Methanococcoides
burtinii. This resulted in a 1.6–2.0-fold increase in kcat,c and 2.8–3.6-fold
increase in kcat,c/KC relative to the photosynthetic model plant Nicotiana
tabacum. This finding was important as improving the poorer carbox-
ylase properties of non-photosynthetic RuBisCO (e.g., archaea) demon-
strated its amenability for improvement relative to photosynthetic
RuBisCO [106]. More recently, Zhou et al. [113] developed an improved
RDE screening method that can identify false positives and discriminate
amino acid changes that result in enhanced carboxylation from those
that
[114]). This new
T7-promoter regulated RDE screening method was applied on Rhodo-
bacter sphaeroids RuBisCO (isoform I) and resulted in a successful
improvement in kcat,c (24 % increase) and kcat,c/KC (18 % increase)
relative to wild type.

increase RuBisCO solubility (trade-off

Despite the success obtained with the RDE screening, this technique
relies on low temperature to slow cell growth, making it unsuitable to
obtain thermostable RuBisCO mutants [114]. This led Gomez-Fernandez
et al. [114] to develop a directed in-vitro evolution platform to improve
the thermostability of Rhodospirillum rubrum RuBisCO (isoform II) in-
dependent of its host’s physiology. The platform consists of several
evolution strategies that included adaptive evolution, focused evolution,
and neutral genetic drift. A dual high-throughput screening system was
applied to identify highly thermostable variants. A relative increase of at
least 1.3-fold in the thermostability of RuBisCO was obtained. Outside
RuBisCO, other efforts in-vivo have also been made, focusing mainly on
improving the following: the photosynthetic efficiency via the incor-
poration of a cyanobacterial CO2-concentrating mechanism (CCM) into
a plant chloroplast [116], the kcat,c via the incorporation of faster

11

RuBisCO variants from other species into plants [117–119] and their
overexpression [120], and the climate resistance of plants via engi-
neering RuBisCO activase for higher thermostability [121].

In summary, recent studies have shown that improving RuBisCO
catalysis is possible via either rational engineering or directed evolution.
Rational engineering only yielded successful results recently [107,108,
110], despite attempts at RuBisCO being made for at least five decades
[106]. This limited success could be attributed to the inherent chal-
lenges associated with RuBisCO. On the one hand, the complexity of its
carboxylation reaction forces RuBisCO to have a highly conserved cat-
alytic site [83]. Therefore, mutations that could lead to faster kinetics,
but involve changes in its active site structure, will therefore not be
favored [83,122]. On the other hand, RuBisCO has a wide catalytic di-
versity among and within its lineages [83,84,89,114], and thus the
expression of desired properties using site-specific mutagenesis will not
be straightforward. In response to this, directed evolution was then
applied as an alternative attempt to improve RuBisCO’s performance
[106]. Compared to rational engineering, directed evolution has yielded
better results [106]. Indeed, RuBisCO appears to favor the application of
random mutagenesis more than site-specific mutagenesis, because it
emulates the natural evolution of enzymes, improving their properties
[106]. This could be because, as with certain RuBisCO types, ancillary
proteins need to be co-expressed for proper functioning [123], which
may be naturally accounted for by random mutagenesis but not by
site-specific mutagenesis. Interestingly, the semi-rational engineering

approach has not been explored with RuBisCO. In this approach, random
mutagenesis is applied to create a library of mutations as in directed
evolution [105]. However, as with rational engineering, site-specific
mutations that lead to desired properties are subsequently identified
and favored to obtain the optimal mutant [105]. Hence,
the
semi-rational approach makes sense considering the previously dis-
cussed rationale. Finally, since the success of enzyme engineering is
strongly dependent on a good screening method that can distinguish
false positives [104,124], it is imperative that further developments be
made in this area in order to obtain RuBisCO with fast catalysis and high
stability. Although promising results were obtained with RDE [106], this
method does not support the acquisition of thermostable RuBisCO
[114]. On the other hand, more research is still needed with the directed
in-vitro evolution platform [114] and rational engineering to obtain
faster and thermostable mutants.

4.2. Immobilization of RuBisCO on support

Enzyme engineering has been used to address RuBisCO’s limitation
by inducing deliberate evolution to generate variants with improved
catalytic and selective capabilities (Section 4.1). Despite some recent
success with enzyme engineering [107,108,110], it is a resource inten-
sive and time-consuming process that requires sophisticated synthetic
biology tools, high-throughput screening, and a thorough understanding
of the enzyme structure, which may not always produce variants with

Fig. 7. Immobilization of RuBisCO focuses on covalent bonding [131,133,134], encapsulation [135,136] and physical adsorption [132,137], using Isoform I and/or
Isoform II. Mechanisms explored for each immobilization strategy are the following: covalent bonding: EDC/NHS-based and DMP-based crosslinking [131] (a), Schiff
base and Michael addition [133] (b), and DNA sequence specific binding [134] (c); encapsulation: affinity binding [135] (d), and in-situ electropolymerization [136]
(e); physical adsorption: electrostatic interaction using self-assembly nanoparticles [137] (f), and hydrophobic microfluidic reactor [132] (g).

desired properties (Section 4.1). Furthermore, enzyme engineering
generates soluble enzymes that require further processing to recover the
products, making the enzymes non-reusable and therefore expensive.
This greatly limits its large-scale implementation, as a considerable
amount of enzyme is needed to attain significant CO2 removal rate (90
%) [125]. On the other hand, enzyme immobilization is a practical
alternative approach to generate reusable enzyme-based systems suit-
able for immediate industrial application [126]. Recently, enzyme
immobilization in CCU has focused heavily on the development of
suitable immobilization strategies to minimize enzyme denaturation
[127], and on the improvement of mass transfer between CO2 and
immobilized enzymes [128]. Despite the stability enhancement brought
about by the structural reinforcement from multiple attachments to the
support and the beneficial changes in the enzyme microenvironment
that it can bring, enzyme immobilization typically suffers from reduced
enzyme activity due to diffusion limitations at the solid-liquid interface
or the encapsulating material [129]. Nevertheless, enzyme immobili-
zation increases the robustness of enzymes (wider operation window)
and allows simultaneous reaction and separation of products from en-
zymes, making enzymes reusable and greatly simplifying the down-
stream product purification process [127]. In general, immobilization
allows enzyme-based systems to be cost-effective and suitable for the
continuous industrial-scale production of useful products [130].

Efforts involving in-vitro RuBisCO immobilization [131–137] focused
solely on its purified form rather than whole-cell systems. Whole-cell
immobilization is considered advantageous for systems employing
complex reactions (multiple enzymes, substrates, and cofactors) due to
built-in systems in cells that can help maintain an optimal reaction
environment [130]. Nevertheless, whole-cell systems have production
yields that are typically insufficient for large-scale production due to the
presence of competing pathways that are necessary for cell survival
[138]. Furthermore, valuable products are trapped inside the cell and
require additional extraction and purification steps downstream,
contributing to the cost of the process [139]. Therefore, the application
of purified enzymes is attractive, since it includes only essential path-
ways for the production of the desired product, making the improve-
ment in its inherent catalytic properties relatively straightforward and
simpler with synthetic biology tools [126]. Therefore, focusing on the

13

immobilization of purified RuBisCO is advantageous, as it circumvents
competing pathways that redirect resources to support cell growth and
proliferation instead of 3-PGA production. Indeed, the immobilization
studies focusing on RuBisCO considered 3-PGA as the stopping point,
with such system being applied in conjunction with existing processes
for further conversion of 3-PGA into more useful organic end-products
[140].

Immobilization of RuBisCO on solid supports is still in its early
developmental stages, with only limited studies [131–137] done so far
(Fig. 7 (a)). The first attempt was reported in 2002 by Chakrabarti et al.
[131], where two types of covalent immobilization strategy on RuBisCO
from spinach leaves (isoform I) were developed: the dicyclohex-
ylcarbodiimide (DCC) coupling on nylon membrane matrix, and the
dimethylpimelimidate (DMP) immobilization on protein A agarose.
Both strategies have been explored on CO2 conversion within a biore-
actor using bubbled pure CO2. Results showed enhanced thermal sta-
bility, reusability, and storage stability relative to the free RuBisCO
(Table 2), when using both strategies. Immobilization also resulted in a
wider range of operational pH (pH 8.0–9.5) compared to the free
RuBisCO (pH 8.5–9.0). Between the two covalent immobilization stra-
tegies, better performance was obtained with DMP than DCC, which was
attributed to a significantly higher enzyme leaching observed with DCC
[131]. Immobilization via the DCC linker results in a crosslinker that is
relatively shorter than when using the DMP linker (Fig. 7 (a)). The
shorter crosslinker length places the enzyme closer to the surface,
causing it to experience more pronounced surface effects [129], as
previously mentioned. This has been observed to result in structural
changes in other enzymes that led to substrate-binding pocket mis-
conformation, but was not observed for longer linker length [141,142].
Nevertheless, this is not true for all enzymes [143], and therefore more
effort is needed in studying the effect of different crosslinker length on
RuBisCO activity. A more recent attempt in covalent immobilization of
RuBisCO (spinach leaves) was made by Zhu et al. [133] for the contin-
uous production of a glucose precursor, 3-PGA, using a microfluidic
reactor. The reactor was made of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) whose
surface was modified with polydopamine (Fig. 7 (b)). Polydopamine
introduces phenolic hydroxyl groups, among others, on the inert surface
[144], allowing covalent amine binding of RuBisCO via para-position of
hydroxyl via
addition [145]. The
RuBisCO-immobilized microfluidic reactors have a reported yield of
13.8 μmol 3-PGA/g RuBisCO/min which is 1.8-folds higher than those
obtained from free RuBisCO. Furthermore, covalent immobilization
enabled a higher RuBisCO loading to be attained in the reaction solu-
tion, which resulted in a higher yield than the saturation-limited free
enzyme. The immobilization strategy also resulted in enhanced stability
in terms of storage (7.2 folds), thermal (6.7 folds), and reusability (78.5
% after 10 cycles) relative to the free RuBisCO.

Carboxysome mimicry served as an important

inspiration in
RuBisCO encapsulation strategies, due to the natural evidence showing
RuBisCO variants with high carboxylation efficiencies and upper-bound
limit activities that are unique in carboxysomes [83,84]. An important
aspect in carboxysomes is the colocalization of CA with RuBisCO (Sec-
tion 3.2), where its proximity relative to RuBisCO has been thought to be
a key factor in enhancing RuBisCO carboxylation [134]. The effect of
inter-enzyme distance between RuBisCO and CA was has been explored
in-vitro through its precise covalent immobilization on DNA nano-
structures using DNA-binding protein adaptors, which are genetically

sequence-specific supports that allow nanometer precision control [146]
of the enzymatic spatial configuration during immobilization [134].
Dinh et al. [134] used a DNA origami scaffold nanostructure to control
the inter-enzyme distance between RuBisCO and CA (Fig. 7 (c)). A
dimeric DNA binding protein adaptor, GCN4, was genetically fused on a
RuBisCO structure to act as a linker for covalent immobilization. Simi-
larly, a modular adaptor, zif-SNAP, was fused to the CA as a linker for
the orthogonal positioning with respect to the GCN4. Two systems were

developed to study the effect of CA proximity on RuBisCO. In system I,
free CA was added to the immobilized RuBisCO, yielding an estimated
inter-enzyme distance of 413 nm. In system II, CA was immobilized with
RuBisCO on the scaffold, yielding an estimated inter-enzyme distance of
20 nm. Interestingly, the presence of free CA with the immobilized
RuBisCO (system I) resulted in a slight decrease in the RuBisCO’s initial
reaction rate, which was further decreased when CA was immobilized in
close proximity to RuBisCO (system II).

Such a decrease in the initial reaction rate in both systems is to be
expected due to the absence of a CO2 diffusion limiting structure that
maintains a CO2 saturated environment near RuBisCO. As discussed in
Section 3.2, carboxysomes consist of selective pores that limit the
diffusion of CO2 outside the shell, resulting in a CO2 saturated envi-
ronment within the carboxysome. Under such conditions, RuBisCO’s
active site is saturated with CO2, allowing carboxylation to proceed at its
maximum rate (Section 3.2). Indeed, the calculation of equilibrium
(cid:0)
], pH = 8.0) shows
[CO2] under the conditions studied (50 mM [HCO3
(cid:0)
]10(pKa-pH) ≈ 50 mM × 10(6.1-8.0) ≈ 252 μM, where pKa
[CO2] ≈ [HCO3

= 6.1 and is the effective pKa between aqueous CO2 and HCO3
[94].
Considering that the Michaelis-Menten constant of a nanostructure
immobilized RuBisCO for CO2 is approximately 96–120 μM at pH = 8.0
[137], RuBisCO’s carboxylation rate is expected to be near its maximum,
which was not observed in the study. This suggests that CO2 may have
diffused away before it could be fixed by RuBisCO (longer distance,
system I). As CA was placed closer to RuBisCO (system II), the rapid
(cid:0)
CO2/HCO3
equilibration may have affected the carboxylation such that
(cid:0)
CO2 was interconverted to HCO3
before it could be fixed by RuBisCO.
Indeed, the presence of CA has been shown to increase the apparent
diffusion of CO2 by 40 times, due to a concentration gradient that fa-
cilitates CO2 diffusion in the solution [147].

inhibition), or after

The importance of encapsulating RuBisCO with CA in a CO2 diffusion
barrier is further supported by the findings of Frey et al. [135], where no
significant change in RuBisCO’s activity was observed either after the
co-encapsulation with CA, after the CA activity inhibition (2.5/s before
inhibition vs. 2.3/s after
the reduction in
inter-enzyme distance through increased high packing density (up to 5
mM) in a simplified artificial carboxysome with no gas diffusion barrier
capacity. The artificial carboxysome was synthesized via engineering of
a protein capsid based on lumazine synthase from Aquifex aeolicus and
consisted of a negatively charged luminal surface. In contrast, the nat-
ural carboxysome consists of a complex protein shell with selective
pores, whose configuration is influenced by the protonation state of the
metabolites under specific pH conditions [92]. This allows certain spe-
(cid:0)
cies to enter (e.g., cytosolic HCO3
and RUBP) and exit (i.e., 3-PGA) the
shell freely, while limiting the diffusion of CO2 efflux and O2 influx into
the shell [92]. Nevertheless, the encapsulated RuBisCO activity was
higher than its free counterpart, presumably due to the stabilization
effect of the engineered protein capsid on RuBisCO’s dimeric structure.
This agrees with the literature, where a significant increase in activity
(100x) was observed in heterodimeric hydrogenase due to its structural
stabilization after its encapsulation in bacteriophage P22 capsids [148].
The design of a good encapsulation strategy is therefore important in
obtaining good RuBisCO activity in-vitro.

Encapsulation strategies focusing solely on RuBisCO are scarce, with
only one attempt made so far. To develop a scalable cell-free system for
large-scale CO2 capture and conversion, Hery et al. [136] encapsulated
RuBisCO in a polypyrrole doped with dodecylbenzenesulfonate anion
(PPy(DBS)) support to investigate its potential to preserve RuBisCO’s
biophysical properties and activity after immobilization (Fig. 7 (e)).
Encapsulation resulted in the formation of
tubular clusters with
RuBisCO generally aligned in a center-to-radial outward direction.
However, the entrapment strategy resulted in a ~53 % decrease in ac-
tivity relative to the free RuBisCO, suggesting an incompatibility be-
tween RuBisCO and the anion [136]. Upon subjection to an acid wash
assay, 40 % activity was retained by the encapsulated RuBisCO, while no
activity was retained with the free enzyme [136]. More studies are

needed to explore RuBisCO’s compatibility with different anions to
examine the potential of polypyrrole for RuBisCO’s encapsulation.

RuBisCO has also been physically immobilized on self-assembled
nanostructures for the development of assemblies mimicking enzy-
matic reaction cascades. Satagopan et al. [137] explored the immobili-
zation of two RuBisCO isoforms (isoform I from Ralstonia eutropha and
isoform II from Rhodospirillum rubrum) on two types of nanostructures, i.
e., nanotubes and nanofibers (Fig. 7 (f)). The nanotubes consisted of
small dipeptide conjugates with two derivatives (A: R=CH3C(O) and B:
R=H) while the nanofiber consisted of fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl
tetrapeptide. These nanostructures were employed to immobilize two
sets of enzyme cascades responsible for the production of RuBisCO’s
substrate, RUBP; one via the ribose-5-phosphate (R5P) to RUBP
pathway, and one via the glucose to RUBP pathway. A weak
charge-based association drives both the nanostructure assembly and
the enzyme immobilization. Higher RuBisCO activity was retained when
using nanofibers in immobilizing RuBisCO alone and the multiple
enzyme cascades compared to the nanotubes, while higher activity
retention was obtained with RuBisCO isoform I compared to RuBisCO
isoform II in all cases. The selectivity factor was improved by 11–20 %
for isoform I, but no improvements were observed for isoform II. Such
difference was attributed to the lack of the small subunits in isoform II,
which leaves the active sites in the large units in a more open configu-
ration, resulting in a more direct influence of the nanostructures [137].
The reported enhancement in the selectivity factor exceeded greatly
those obtained via mutagenesis and bioselection [63,124,149–155].
Despite improvements in the selectivity factor, the kcat,c of all immobi-
lized enzymes was lower than that of their free counterparts.

Depending on the immobilization method applied, differences in the
post-immobilization activity retention and stability enhancement can be
obtained. Zhu et al. compared their previous efforts on covalent bonding
of RuBisCO on a PDA modified PDMS microfluidic reactor [133] with
physical immobilization via hydrophobic interaction on a pristine PDMS
reactor [132] (Fig. 7 (g)). Physical immobilization resulted in inferior
activity retention and stability enhancement compared to covalent
immobilization [132] (Table 2). The weaker forces governing physical
immobilization were shown to be insufficient in reinforcing the enzyme
structure under denaturing conditions [132]. Furthermore, physical
adsorption resulted in a non-specific immobilization of RuBisCO,
causing the formation of multiple layers that led to a stearic hindrance of
the active site [132]. Nevertheless, it was possible to remove the dena-
tured enzymes with a simple acid buffer wash and replenish them with
fresh enzymes (≥95 % activity restoration after five refreshing cycles)
when using physical immobilization, which was not possible with co-
valent immobilization [132]. Proof-of-concept for large synthesis was
also demonstrated by scaling up to 6 parallel reactors [132].

In summary, RuBisCO immobilization is still at its early stages; with
some preliminary studies consider covalent immobilization [131,133,
134], encapsulation [135–137], and physical adsorption [132] as
immobilization strategies. Despite yielding some promising results in
terms of thermal, storage, pH stability [131–133], and reusability
[131–133], the immobilization of RuBisCO generally resulted in a
decrease in activity post-immobilization [132–134,137], except in the
works by Frey et al. [135]. In particular, covalent immobilization has
shown the highest enhancement in terms of overall stability [131–133],
but also yielded the worst post-immobilization activity retention among
the immobilization methods explored [133,134]. In applications where
high stability is important, such as in in-vitro CCU, covalent immobili-
zation is therefore desirable, but further research must be made to
improve post-immobilization activity retention. Considering the signif-
icant differences in terms of stability obtained between the DCC and
DMP coupling methods [131] (Table 2), it is therefore interesting to
explore the effect of different crosslinkers types and chain length on
enzyme activity and stability. On the other hand, the poor CO2/O2
selectivity of RuBisCO should also be considered, as O2 will be present
regardless of the feed gas stream to be treated. Encapsulation strategies

have been explored to deal with this however, efforts focusing on car-
boxysome mimicry with CO2 diffusion barrier properties in-vitro are still
in its early-stage. Alternatively, an additional gas conditioning step can
be implemented beforehand to remove O2 from the feed gas stream.
Membrane technology has been widely applied in gas separation, with
numerous materials already developed for O2 removal from gas mix-
tures, and is therefore a strong option [156]. On the other hand,
although physical adsorption using self-assembled nanostructures
resulted in the highest enhancement in selectivity factor, this system is
not stable at high temperature [137]. Incorporation of materials that can
favor the carboxylation reaction by concentrating CO2 near RuBisCO
using CO2-philic solvents such as ionic liquids [157,158] and amino
acids [159] could therefore complement the covalent immobilization of
RuBisCO.

4.3. Enzyme mimicking

Enzyme mimicking is an alternative way to address RuBisCO’s poor
stability, by designing stable synthetic systems that carry the blueprint
of RuBisCO’s binding (ligand)
[160,161] and/or catalytic site
[162–167]. Enzyme mimicking results in a smaller and simpler enzy-
matic system devoid of the auxiliary structures required for the so-
phisticated control mechanisms present in biocatalysts [168]. As a
design system, enzyme mimics can be tailored to have high thermal
stability and the ability to use a wide range of substrates [38]. There is
also the possibility for eliminating the need for expensive substrates
[161,165], thus dramatically decreasing the operating cost. There are
two main approaches used to design enzyme mimics:
functional
mimicking and structural mimicking [169]. Functional mimicking fo-
cuses on the mimicry of the enzyme’s active center by choosing metal
complexes with similar activities, while structural mimicking focuses on
the structural mimicry of the functional moieties surrounding the active
center [169]. Metalloenzymes consist of (a) central transition metal ion
(s) stabilized by surrounding amino acid ligands [169]. Enzyme mimicry
can therefore focus on either choosing (a) suitable central transition
metal ion(s) (functional mimicking) or developing suitable ligands for
ion(s) (structural
improved complexation with the central metal
mimicking).

RuBisCO mimicking has focused heavily on designing RuBisCO-
based synthetic enzymes with high stability. Most recently, stable
RuBisCO mimics were obtained by synthesizing ligands that can form
stable metal complexes to prevent metal dissociation. Following the
activation mechanism of RuBisCO’s active site where CO2 reacts with its
lysine side chain to form a carbamate moiety that is stabilized by the
Mg2+
metal ion (Section 3.1), coordinatively unsaturated metal sites can
be generated to accommodate different metal ions and polyamide li-
gands for spontaneous CO2 uptake without the need for RUBP [161].
Díaz et al. [160] synthesized the first pyridine-functionalized ligand 2,6,
9,12,16-pentaaza[17]-(2,6)pyridinophane, and evaluated its ability to
form a complex using Cu2+
as the central metal ion. This was later
extended by Verdejo et al. [161] by replacing the pyridine spacer [160]
with a terpyridine spacer for improved CO2 uptake. The CO2 uptake of
such complex without RUBP was demonstrated using Cu2+
as
central metal ions. The use of Zn2+
as central metal ion resulted in 68.4
% higher average CO2 uptake than Cu2+
(180 min total), due to the
favorable carboxylation thermodynamics of the Zn2+
based structure
[161]. Despite the change in spacer or central metal ion, the carboxyl-
ation mechanism of the RuBisCO mimics was reminiscent to that of
RuBisCO, highlighting the versatility of enzyme mimics. Unfortunately,
tests for neither thermal and pH stability nor reusability were performed
on the synthesized RuBisCO mimics in either of the two studies [160,
161].

and Zn2+

On the other hand, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been
widely used to mimic the active sites of metalloenzymes [170,171] due
to their strong resemblance to the metalloenzyme’s structural configu-
ration [170]. MOFs have been recently applied to mimic RuBisCO’s

Fig. 8. RuBisCO mimicking strategies can be broadly grouped into ligand synthesis [160,161], nano-structure synthesis [163], and computational modelling
approach [164–167]. For the computational modelling approach, different alternative compounds have been explored for their potential to imitate key chemical
groups in RuBisCO’s active site (highlighted in different colors). Residue numbers shown in computational modelling approach correspond to activated RuBisCO in
Spinacia oleracea (and Rhodospirillum rubrum) [165].

active site, in order to directly produce fuel from solar energy at room
temperature [163]. Mg2+
was used as the central metal ion and was
co-deposited with terephthalic acid molecules, forming a 2D ionic
network [163]. This 2D ionic network is characterized by a unit cell
comprised of one Mg2+
cation and three deprotonated terephthalic acid
molecules. The resulting ionic network showed evidence of CO2 and O2
gas absorption capacity, with O2 adsorption in the Mg2+
center causing
distortion in the metal-organic bonds that led to a structural collapse
[163].

Several computational studies [164–167] have also been conducted
to design suitable RuBisCO mimics that are capable of reversible, direct
CO2 capture from air for CO2 capture and release (CCR). Prior to the
catalysis step, RuBisCO undergoes activation, where its active-site
Lys201 side chain is carbamylated with an activator CO2 and then sta-
bilized by complexation with Mg2+
[20,172]. This CO2 capture by
Lys201 was previously verified to be a good candidate for
capture-and-release systems via computational modelling [164–167].
The success of RuBisCO’s active site structure lies in favorable thermo-
dynamics that allows control of the reaction’s spontaneity with tem-
perature [165,167]. Recent efforts focus on determining hypothetical
thermochemical properties (Gibbs free enthalpy, reaction enthalpy, re-
action entropy) that allow capture-and-release as a function of central
metal ion type [164], oligopeptides as a lysine imitator [166] and,
capture temperature and atmospheric CO2 concentration [167]. The
obtained hypothetical properties could then be used as a guide in the
design of RuBisCO mimics in the future. Lastly, Glaser et al. [165]
theoretically designed a RuBisCO mimic for CCR that does not require

any substrate, using a small molecular model system: methylamine as
the active site lysine imitator, aldehyde or ketone as the hydrogen-bond
acceptor, and magnesium formate as a simple model of Mg2+
receptor
site. A summary of the different enzyme mimicking strategies adopted
for RuBisCO is shown in Fig. 8 below.

In summary, enzyme mimicking is a powerful tool in designing
RuBisCO mimics with high stability and/or capture-and-release capa-
bility without the need for substrate [161,165]. Nevertheless, studies on
RuBisCO mimicry are still in their early stages, with most efforts
focusing on the design and characterizations [160,161,163–167] to
understand their underlying kinetics, rather than their practical in-vitro
application in CCU [162]. Thus, more studies are needed regarding the
latter, especially in terms of knowing how their performance compares
with their natural counterpart.

5. Applications and implications

The central role of RuBisCO in photosynthesis made it a key gateway
in improving agriculture and climate mitigation. This is reflected
through intense efforts in engineering RuBisCO variants with improved
catalytic properties (Section 4) and their deliberate application in
improving crop yields, carbon efficiency in crops, and climate mitiga-
tion. In the following section, the three main areas of RuBisCO’s appli-
cation (agriculture, climate mitigation, and microbial cell factory) will
be briefly discussed. The readers are referred to recent reviews for a
detailed discussion of RuBisCO’s application in agriculture and climate
mitigation.

5.1. Agricultural impacts

One of the main applications of RuBisCO in agriculture is its engi-
neering to generate climate-resilient crops by enhancing the efficiency
of photosynthesis for improved crop yields under stressful conditions (e.
g., drought, high temperature, saline environment). Indeed, the esti-
mated efficiency of photosynthesis is <6 % [173], showing great po-
tential to improve and enhance crop yield. The influence of RuBisCO on
crop yield can be explained by its participation in the CBB cycle, where
G3P is synthesized as a product. G3P is a metabolic intermediate used in
the synthesis of starch and sucrose [174], which plays a key role in plant
growth and osmotic regulation, respectively [175]. In particular, starch
is used by plants to synthesize amylopectin, which comprises the
structural unit in plants, while sucrose plays an active role in the
transportation of nutrients, water, and signaling the molecules needed
for biomass growth [175]. Considering that the reaction catalyzed by
RuBisCO is the rate limiting step in the CBB cycle, enhancing RuBisCO’s
catalytic performance has therefore been identified as one of the most
energetically effective approaches for improving photosynthesis [86].
Strategies used to generate improved RuBisCO mutants typically employ
the techniques discussed in Section 4.1.

Nature also provided an alternative source for improved RuBisCO
variants. Indeed, recent discoveries made in proteobacteria uncovered
the fastest RuBisCO so far (22/s), which is ~6-fold higher than the mean
for plant RuBisCO [176]. These improved RuBisCOs were expressed and
then replaced native RuBisCO in plants to improve carboxylation [177].
Although optimistic improvements of up to 30 % in CO2 assimilation and
plant growth were estimated using this strategy [86], significant chal-
lenges were encountered in practice. Of importance is the inherent dif-
ference in the protein folding of RuBisCO from different organisms,
making the successful expression of fast RuBisCOs (typically found in
bacteria) in plants extremely challenging [27]. Another equally impor-
tant limitation is RuBisCO’s inherent activity – selectivity trade-off
(Section 3.1), where fast RuBisCOs (both in Nature [176] or mutants
[29]) exhibit low Sc/o and therefore require the co-expression of CCM to
limit oxygenation and photorespiration. Indeed, although kinetic im-
provements relative to wild type were achieved using variants of both
bacteria and archaea (Section 4.4.1), their low carboxylation efficiency
and Sc/o have limited photosynthesis improvement under current at-
mospheric CO2 concentrations [27]. Engineering the eukaryotic form I
RuBisCO, which has inherently high kcat,c/Kc efficiency and Sc/o,
emerged as a recent strategy to deal with these limitations [123,178].
Nevertheless, the challenge associated with the co-expression of specific
ancillary chaperones in directed evolution must first be addressed [179].
The readers are referred to Ref. [29] for a detailed discussion of recent
advances in RuBisCO engineering to improve photosynthesis.

The incorporation of a CCM into the C3 photosynthetic pathway is
another important research focus to improve the efficiency of photo-
synthesis via RuBisCO. The C3 photosynthetic pathway is the predom-
inant pathway in plants and is observed in important crops that
contribute significantly to the global biomass production and carbon
cycling, such as wheat, rice, soybeans and potatoes [27]. Hence,
improving the efficiency of photosynthesis in such crops is important
from an agricultural and environmental point of view. Incorporation of
CCM in C3 crops was estimated to improve crop yield by 50 % [180].
There are currently two main approaches explored: the biophysical and
biochemical approach [27]. The biophysical approach deals with the
expression of genes responsible for the specialized CCM structures of
cyanobacteria (carboxysome) or algae (pyrenoids) in the chloroplast
[27]. While the expression of simplified carboxysome in plants with
encapsulated RuBisCO has been reported, no improvement in photo-
synthesis was attained due to the lack of pumping and accumulation
mechanisms for inorganic carbon inside the chloroplast [181]. On the
other hand, research involving pyrenoids has focused on understanding
the interaction process between the small subunit of Rubisco and EPYC1,
along with other pivotal proteins, to identify the minimal sequence

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 105 (2024) 101184

modifications needed to recreate a functional pyrenoid within the
chloroplasts of C3 crops [182]. On the other hand, the biochemical
approach of introducing CCM in C3 crops involves the expression of the
C4 pathway in a heterologous host and the implementation of Kranz
anatomical traits [27]. Success was achieved in the in-vivo conversion of
CO2 into C4 acids [183] however, the subsequent decarboxylation of C4
acids was unsuccessful [184]. A full Kranz two cell-type C4 mechanism
still remains to be implemented. For a detailed review of the recent
advances in CCM for pyrenoid, the readers are referred to Ref. [185].

Alternative strategies, such as engineering RuBisCO activase and
increasing RuBisCO expression, have also been explored to improve
photosynthetic efficiency and crop yields. The critical role of RuBisCO
activase in removing inhibitory compounds from RuBisCO’s active sites
during carboxylation under heat stress paves the way for engineering
climate-resistant crops for sustainable agriculture. RuBisCO activase is
the regulatory protein responsible for the activation of RuBisCO [186].
Deactivation of RuBisCO activase due to heat damage at high temper-
atures was linked to a decrease in RuBisCO activation [187,188]. The
heat sensitivity of RuBisCO activase [187,188] has significant future
implications as heat wave conditions significantly increase photorespi-
ration (three-fold), resulting in an overall negative carbon assimilation
and reduced crop yields in plants [189]. In 2022, increased drought
conditions and record-high temperatures in Europe due to climate
change resulted in a reduced carbon intake of 56–62 TgC in summer
[190]. The engineering of RuBisCO activase involved replacement with
thermostable ones [191] or overexpression [192,193]. In both cases
[191,192], RuBisCO activation, crop growth, and seed yield were
maintained, resulting in improved heat, drought and salinity tolerance
at high temperature, which would otherwise result in plant damage. The
readers are referred to recent reviews for more details [186,194]. On the
other hand, increasing RuBisCO’s expression was shown to improve
nitrogen use efficiency in rice [195]. Only 30–40 % of the nitrogen
applied to the soils are utilized by plants for growth and development
[196]. Rice cultivated at insufficient nitrogen levels resulted in its
redirection to RuBisCO synthesis, compromising photosynthesis [195].
Overexpression of RuBisCO improved nitrogen absorption in rice,
enhancing its biomass and yield [195]. Therefore, improving nitrogen
use efficiency improves agricultural sustainability by not only mini-
mizing the amount of fertilizers needed in soils, but also by improving
crop yield under limited nitrogen.

5.2. Climate change mitigation

RuBisCO’s contribution to climate change mitigation can be
emphasized through its active role in the global carbon cycle, which
comprises the dynamic carbon flux between the atmosphere, oceans,
and terrestrial biospheres, as well as their carbon stocks or pools [197,
198]. RuBisCO therefore participates in the carbon cycle through plants
and microorganisms which assimilate and release CO2 in the atmosphere
via photosynthesis and respiration, respectively. The majority of the
assimilated CO2 ends up being released back into the atmosphere via
respiration (98 %), sequestering only a fraction of CO2 as stocks or pools
in the soil and ocean [197,198]. As anthropogenic contributions
continue to increase with time, the global carbon cycle is perturbed in
such a way that the carbon sequestered in Nature is outweighed by the
combined carbon released into the atmosphere. In 2012–2021, the
anthropogenic emissions contributed an average of 9.6 Pg CO2/yr to the
atmospheric carbon pool, while 1.2 Pg CO2/yr was due to land-use
change [198]. 3.1 Pg CO2/yr of the emitted CO2 was stored in the
terrestrial biosphere, while 2.9 Pg CO2/yr was stored in the ocean,
resulting to a net increase of 5.2 Pg CO2/yr in the atmosphere [198].
Nevertheless, both the terrestrial and ocean biospheres show great ca-
pacity for carbon sequestration [197,198]. The terrestrial biosphere
currently holds a 3350 Pg CO2/yr carbon pool, while ~40000 Pg CO2 is
stored in the ocean [198]. By comparison, the carbon pool in the at-
mosphere is 875 Pg CO2 [198]. Recent efforts have therefore focused on

harnessing the potential of carbon sequestration in land and ocean by
strengthening the carbon sinks in both ecosystems.

Carbon farming aims to increase carbon sequestration in the soil by
increasing carbon demand through increased crop and microbial
biomass yield [199]. The carbon demand in the soil is dictated by the
nutrient requirements of the crop and the microbial biomass in the
rhizosphere [199]. Plants use part of the assimilated CO2 to produce
organic compounds released into the soil, which are then assimilated by
microorganisms for biomass growth. In turn, nitrogen and phosphorous
are then released as by-products which plants use for crop development.
Thus, photosynthesis is regulated according to the carbon demand in the
improving the sink
soil-microbe rhizosphere [199]. Unfortunately,
strength or the carbon demand in the rhizosphere has not been a
straightforward process [199]. While root systems play an important
role in the supply and storage of soil organic carbon in the soil, the exact
root characteristics crucial to increasing and ensuring long-term storage
are still uncertain [199]. Depending on the development stage of the
plants, which is either vegetative or reproductive, the plants can be
limited by sink- (crop yield) or source- (photosynthesis) limited,
respectively [199]. Understanding which limitation the plant
is
currently in will be important to determine whether focus should be
given on improving photosynthesis or crop yield [199]. Nevertheless,
with continued increase in CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, such
conditions favor source strength and therefore future attention should
be focused on improving sink strength [199]. On the other hand, utili-
zation of cover crops was identified as a crucial strategy to control
heterotrophic respiration from bare soils after harvest [200]. Estimates
show that an additional carbon assimilation of 0.12 Pg CO2/yr can be
attained with cover crops, which is 8 % of the direct annual GHG
emission from agriculture [201]. Furthermore, cover crops improve soil
nutrition, enhance soil microbial communities [202], and reduce soil
carbon losses by up to 60 % relative to the business-as-usual scenario
[203]. More details on carbon farming crops can be found in [199].

On the other hand, fisheries carbon sink is a strategy explored to
increase CO2 absorption in the water bodies, by increasing fisheries
activities and then harvesting the aquatic products to remove the
absorbed carbon from water [204]. Therefore, it strengthens food se-
curity while addressing the global warming issue [204]. Notable ex-
amples include algae farming, bivalve farming, and filter feeding fish
farming [204]. RuBisCO’s contribution to strengthening fisheries carbon
sink can be highlighted through its contribution to algae farming [205]
and marine microorganisms [206,207], where it participates in the
uptake and conversion of CO2 into biomass. High-productive seaweed
varieties have been intentionally bred and employed to enhance the
carbon fixation capacity and yield by up to 75 %, relative to natural
populations [208]. Nevertheless, optimistic estimates via seaweed
farming approach project its carbon sequestration contribution to be
offset by emissions induced from its cultivation and supply chains [208].
Decarbonization of supply chain through the integration of renewable
energy, the strategic location of the farming sites to minimize the carbon
emissions associated with transportation, and the focus on the produc-
tion of long-term carbon storage products from biomass were identified
as crucial considerations to minimize its carbon footprint [208]. Indeed,
the assessment of the carbon emission and carbon sink capacity of
several coastal provinces in China showed the possibility to offset the

increase in carbon emissions and to create a negative carbon emission,
when fisheries carbon sink is well-developed and optimized to minimize
the carbon emission associated with its activities [205].

5.3. Biomass and biochemical production

Recent applications of RuBisCO in the context of CCU have focused
on in-vivo genetic manipulations of microorganisms to allow deliberate
production of useful chemicals. Microorganisms were modified to
exhibit either biosynthetic pathways that allow the production of target
chemicals, as in the case of autotrophs, or the CBB pathway that allows
CO2 to be used as substrate, as in the case of heterotrophs [44]. In both
cases, DNA recombination was used to insert key heterologous genes
into host DNA, allowing the implementation of synthetic pathways.
Although the augmentation of the autotrophic pathways is technically
simpler than remodeling the entire central and energy metabolisms in
heterotrophs [63], more emphasis has been placed on the latter due to
the long-term benefits of using heterotrophs. The relative simplicity of
heterotrophs has allowed more extensive synthetic biology tools to be
available than more complex autotrophs [209]. Furthermore, hetero-
trophs have a faster growth rate than autotrophs, which means lower
cost and increased productivity [209]. The most notable is the widely
studied Escherichia coli, which has a growth rate that is five times faster
than cyanobacteria [210].

The introduction of the CBB pathway in E. coli has focused on the
production of valuable compounds with low carbon footprint [211].
5-Aminolevulinic Acid (ALA) is an important compound used as a pro-
drug for photodynamic therapy in cancers [212]. ALA is synthesized by
reacting glycine and succinyl-CoA with ALA synthase as catalyst, pro-
ducing CO2 as a by-product [211]. The introduction of RuBisCO and
phosphoribulosekinase (PRK) genes
from Synechococcus elongatus
allowed the expression of the CBB pathway in E. coli, where the
by-product CO2 is redirected to be used in glucose synthesis as a carbon
source (in-situ recycling) for improved product and biomass yield [211],
as also observed in related works [213–215]. Despite some success in
in-situ CO2 recycling, RuBisCO’s expression in E. coli is toxic and can
limit the CO2 by-product assimilation via the CBB pathway [216].
Indeed, RuBisCO interferes with the translational process by binding to
the RNA, causing growth retardation and cell morphology alteration in
RuBisCO-equipped E. coli [216]. In the production of cadaverine, a
precursor for bio-based polyamides such as nylon [217,218], L-lysine is
converted using lysine decarboxylase (CadA) in-vivo, releasing CO2 as a
by-product [215,219]. The co-expression of the CO2-fixing enzymes CA
and RuBisCO-PRK, with CadA, resulted in a significantly lower CO2
release with the CA-CadA system (4.95 g CO2/g dry cell weight)
compared to the RuBisCO-PRK-CadA system (13.32 g CO2/g dry cell
weight), and the CadA only system (11.62 g CO2/g dry cell weight)
[215]. On the other hand, its application in a dual microbial system
composed of RuBisCO-equipped yeast resulted in improved bioethanol
yield compared to untreated lignocellulosic biomasses such as Napier
grass, rice straw powders, and xylose [220,221].

At the process-level, the mixotrophic cultivation of microalgae was
applied to increase biomass productivity in microalgae [222]. The CO2
absorption and microalgae conversion (CAMC) hybrid system is a
two-step process in which CO2 is absorbed using an alkaline solvent and

) as a first step, followed by the addition
converted to bicarbonate (HCO3
(cid:0)
of organic carbon such as acetate with HCO3
for their conversion into
biomass using microalgae as a second-step [222,223]. The presence of
both inorganic and organic carbon types up-regulates different linked
pathways, resulting in a cumulative increase in the overall carbon up-
take [222]. The intracellular CA residing within the carboxysome con-
(cid:0)
from the absorption unit to CO2
verts the externally supplied HCO3
in-vivo, which then participates in the CBB pathway to ultimately pro-
duce carbohydrates [224]. The increased carbohydrate production
up-regulates the glycolysis pathway which, in turn, produces excessive
pyruvate that enhances the fatty acid production [222]. Meanwhile,
acetate is converted to acetyl-CoA in-vivo, which can participate in either
lipid synthesis or the TCA pathway [222]. Mixotrophic cultivation has
thus resulted in increased maximum biomass (60.47 %), total carbon
conversion capacity (63.06 %), and efficiency (59.77 %); relative to the
(cid:0)
control group with only HCO3
(autotrophic condition) [222]. A sum-
mary of various CCU related applications of RuBisCO is shown in
Table 3.

5.4. Comparison with alternative CO2 capture strategies

Alternative CO2 capture strategies are mainly synthetic in nature,
focusing on the capture of CO2 from the combustion process. There are
currently three main carbon capture strategies: pre-combustion capture,
post-combustion capture, and oxyfuel combustion capture [230]. In the
pre-combustion capture, steam and oxygen are injected into the fuel gas,
where the released CO2 is then separated in the subsequent step which
occurs prior to the combustion process. The oxyfuel combustion capture
also removes CO2 before the combustion process, however, pure oxygen
is injected into the fuel gas to produce CO2 and water. The resulting gas
stream then undergoes a water condensation step to recover the purified
CO2, thus simplifying the CO2 separation process. Unlike the first two
strategies, post-combustion capture is concerned with CO2 removal after
the fuel combustion of the combustion step. Although post-combustion
capture deals with more dilute CO2 that makes separation challenging,
it is the simplest to implement and retrofit in existing processes, since
separation occurs after combustion [231]. As such, post-combustion
capture is the most technologically advanced, with commercial appli-
cations already existing around the world [232,233].

Among the four main post-combustion CO2 capture technologies
(absorption, adsorption, cryogenic, membrane), chemical absorption
using amine solvents is currently considered as the benchmark for post-
combustion CO2 capture; with several plants in operation around the
world and a capture capacity of at least 1000 Mt CO2/yr [233]. Detailed
review of alternative carbon capture strategies can be found in
Ref. [232], while discussion of their technology readiness level can be
found in Ref. [233]. Despite the promise of the previously discussed CO2
capture strategies, they employ energy intensive processes and chemical
substances which are highly toxic and corrosive [233]. Furthermore,
they support the continued use of non-renewable fossil carbon as feed-
stock. The biological route has emerged as a sustainable pathway for
CO2 mitigation, and consists mainly of enzymatic, (micro)algal, and
bacterial technologies [234]. Unlike synthetic strategies, the biological

proteobacteria, allowing the production of various useful organic compounds

products are highlighted in orange.

strategies simultaneously capture and convert CO2 into intermediates
that can be used for the production of useful end-products, thus poten-
tially eliminating the need for fossil carbon feedstock. Furthermore, they
operate near ambient conditions and do not employ toxic chemicals
[235], making the biological strategy a green process.

The enzymatic technology utilizes CO2-fixing enzymes, such as car-
to facilitate in-vitro CO2
boxylases, dehydrogenases, and analogs,
dissolution into a benign liquid phase, and its conversion to useful C1
intermediates such as methanol, methane, and carbon monoxide
(Fig. 3). The C1 intermediates can then serve as feed for existing pro-
cesses, to produce higher molecular weight building blocks that can be
used for the synthesis of commercial end-products (Table 4). Carbonic
anhydrase is currently the predominat enzyme used in CCU, due to its
exceptional carboxylation rate (Fig. 5 (b)). Although the majority of the
efforts involving CA are in research to pilot scale [236], commercial
scale application has been realized [237]. Aside from its wide-variety of
(cid:0)
uses, HCO3
can participate in different chemical reactions to produce
various commercial end-products [238]. On the other hand, both
microalgal and bacterial technologies can be regarded as RuBisCO-based
technologies, as they rely on cellular RuBisCO to assimilate CO2 through
the CBB cycle. Unlike the enzymatic technology, RuBisCO-based tech-
nologies have a lower CO2 capture rate owing to the slow kinetics of
RuBisCO, and focus on the direct conversion of CO2 into higher mo-
lecular weight organic compounds (Section 5.3). RuBisCO-based tech-
nologies therefore offer more direct CCU into commercial end-products,
bypassing the need for downstream processes that are energy intensive

6. Potential organic compounds obtained using RuBisCO

High value CO2 conversion using heterotrophic microorganisms has
been shown to rely heavily on linking captured CO2 with the central
carbon metabolism in proteobacteria (Section 5.4). RuBisCO played a
crucial role in bridging this gap by converting captured CO2 into a
central
intermediate via CBB pathway (Section 5.4). Among the
currently known natural autotrophic CO2 fixation pathways [25,46,48,
50], the CBB pathway (Fig. 1) is the most closely connected to the
central carbon metabolism of proteobacteria, requiring a minimal
number of additional genes to be introduced [44]. For this reason, the
majority of current efforts investigating the production of useful
chemicals from CO2 using microorganisms involved the CBB pathway

21

(Section 5.4, Table 3). On the other hand, RuBisCO can be used to
produce useful chemicals through 3-PGA via different central metabolic
pathways in proteobacteria (Fig. 9) [244]. 3-PGA is the first stable in-
termediate in the CBB pathway that undergoes further reduction to form
G3P [20,244,245]. G3P then participates in the partial glycolysis
pathway, ultimately producing pyruvate [244]. As a central intermedi-
ate, pyruvate can participate in numerous reaction pathways to produce
a wide variety of useful organic compounds [244,246] (Fig. 9).

The production of L-serine from 3-PGA is an interesting pathway for
the valuable organic conversion of CO2 using RuBisCO. L-serine has
been identified as one of the top 30 most interesting building block
chemical produced through biological or chemical conversions [247]. It
is widely used as an amino acid supplement in sports and health drinks, a
moisturizing agent in antiaging skin care, and a major component of
third-generation amino acid infusion [248]. In our body, L-serine is
metabolized to produce sphingolipids [249], which play a significant
role in signal transduction, stress responses, immune reactions, mem-
brane structure, and brain development [250]. Indeed, L-serine sup-
plementation has been reported to induce anti-depressive effects in rats

the chemical synthesis,

[251]. Currently, there are four main processes to produce L-serine: the
extraction from protein hydrolysates,
the
enzyme or cellular conversion from glycine precursor with a C1 com-
pound such as methanol, and the microbial fermentation from renew-
able feedstocks [248]. Among these, the microbial fermentation process
offers great promise for the industrial-scale production of L-serine, due
to its use of cheaper substrate, sustainability and environmental
friendliness [248]. However, due to the complicated regulatory network
and the critical importance of L-serine in a number of cellular reactions,
achieving large titers of L-serine production from natural microorgan-
isms still poses great challenges [248]. On the other hand, L-serine can
be produced from 3-PGA via the phosphorylated pathway or via the
glycerate pathway (Fig. 10, Table 5).

Life cycle analysis was recently employed to assess and compare the
carbon footprint of two L-serine production processes [140]: the con-

ribose-5-phosphate, using immobilized phosphoribosyl isomerase and
phosphoribulokinase as enzymes, and ATP as a coenzyme [137]. The
3-PGA is then produced by reacting RUBP with CO2 using immobilized
RuBisCO, where 3-PGA is converted to L-serine via the phosphorylated
[249,252]. Production of 1 kg L-serine was

nanostructure-enzyme process, the production of L-serine using the
nanostructure-multienzyme process resulted in a higher carbon foot-
print (≥48.7 kg CO2/kg serine) than the conventional process (≥17.9 kg
CO2/kg serine). A detailed life cycle impact assessment of
the
nanostructure-enzyme process showed that the ATP inventory is the
largest contributor to the carbon footprint
for 3-PGA synthesis
(82.1–91.3 %), and is responsible for 21.0–39.2 % of the total carbon
footprint for L-serine synthesis. When an ATP regeneration system was
considered in the nanostructure-multienzyme process, the carbon foot-
print for 3-PGA production due to the ATP inventory was reduced by
84.6–97.6 %. However, this resulted in a reduced carbon footprint for
L-serine production of ≥30.1 kg CO2/kg serine, which is still 1.68 times
higher than the carbon footprint of the conventional process (≥17.9 kg
CO2/kg serine). For the ATP regenerated nanostructure-enzyme process,
the use of NAD
for L-serine synthesis from 3-PGA was shown to be the
largest contributor (31.8–75.7 %) to the total carbon footprint. Although
a NAD
regeneration system was not considered in the study due to the
lack of experimental data, extrapolation of the carbon footprint reduc-
regener-
tion obtained with the ATP regeneration system for the NAD
ation system resulted in 25 % less carbon footprint (13.3 kg CO2/kg
serine) than the conventional process (17.9 kg CO2/kg serine), if both
ATP and NAD
regeneration system are present. Furthermore, the use of
environmentally friendly alternative materials for the nanostructures
used in the immobilization of enzymes, such as cellulose and chitin
nanofibers [140], is expected to contribute to further reduction of the
carbon footprint.

There are three key substrates derived from 3-PGA for CO2 organic
synthesis: dihydroxyacetone phosphate, pyruvate, and acetyl-CoA. 3-
PGA can undergo reduction into BGP using ATP and phosphoglycerate
kinase, which in turn, can then be converted to G3P using NADH and
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase [46]. G3P then enters the
partial glycolysis pathway [244], where it is converted to dihydroxy-
acetone phosphate using NAD
and triose-phosphate isomerase [253].
In this pathway, pyruvate is produced as the end-product [254] that can
further undergo aerobic respiration using the NAD
, CoA, and pyruvate
dehydrogenase complex to produce acetyl-CoA [255]. These key sub-
strates can be used to produce numerous useful organic compounds, as
shown in Fig. 10. Further details about the application, the current in-
dustrial production method and its associated limitations, and the
metabolic synthesis pathway of the organic compound produced are
summarized in Table 5.

+

+

Although 3-PGA shows potential to produce numerous valuable
organic compounds from CO2, its challenges are two-fold: the produc-
tion of 3-PGA is catalyzed by a slow enzyme, RuBisCO; and the con-
version of 3-PGA into useful compounds involves complex, multi-step
processes catalyzed by multiple enzymes and expensive cofactors
[288–290] (Fig. 10). Despite successful demonstrations made in-vivo,
obtaining large titers from microorganisms is still unsuccessful [244].
Microorganisms are equipped with highly interdependent metabolic
pathways that are heavily regulated to maintain optimal conditions
within the cells for growth and maintenance, limiting the effectiveness
of current in-vivo synthetic biology tools [291]. One possible way to
address this is to either screen Nature for RuBisCO variants with faster
carboxylation rate, as done with increasing photosynthetic efficiency in
plants (Section 5.1), or use in-vitro synthetic biology tools to modify
RuBisCO to increase 3-PGA yield (as discussed in Section 4), and then
modify microorganisms to use 3-PGA as an alternative carbon source
[292] for the production of other chemicals. In-vitro modification in-
volves the isolation of the relevant cellular component(s) to form a
cell-free system, which is thus decoupled from the inherent cellular
regulatory metabolic limitations [291]. This leads to distinctive ad-
vantages such as relatively higher product yield, productivity, easy
product separation, process control, and optimization [64,133,291,
293]. Although cell-free systems have been shown to offer an efficient
and effective route for industrial-scale chemical biosynthesis [290,294,
295], the need for expensive substrates and cofactors have been crucial
limiting factors for wide-scale implementation [288–290].

Within the context of RuBisCO, several efforts have been previously
explored in the regeneration of its expensive RUBP substrate from
cheaper substrates in-vitro. Wong et al. [296] developed a method to
synthesize relatively large quantities of RUBP (>10 g) from adenosine
monophosphate (AMP), a non-food source alternative, or glucose in-vi-
tro, using immobilized enzymes. Both RUBP synthesis pathways involve
relatively fewer reaction steps, enzymes, and cofactors (3–4 reaction
steps, 3–7 enzymes) [296] compared to the CBB pathway (6 reaction
steps, 9 enzymes to regenerate RUBP from G3P [296]). These relatively
straightforward approaches show the potential to make RUBP synthesis
in-vitro more economical. Nevertheless, the synthesis route is greatly
limited in obtaining RUBP that is substantially free of xylulose-1,
5-biphosphate (<0.1 %), which is a strong RuBisCO inhibitor [296].
Later, Bhattacharya et al. [297] extended Wong et al.’s [296] method by
developing a continuous process for RUBP production from glucose,
using packed-bed reactors in-series. The reactor is operated under plug
flow conditions, with the enzymes immobilized on a nylon beads matrix
via the DCC coupling method (Fig. 7 (a)). The resulting reactor has a
total length of 70 cm, an inner diameter of 10 cm and a RUBP yield of 60
% from glucose [297]. Nevertheless, the reactor was sensitive to changes
in the initial substrate concentration and changes in the flow-rate. Un-
fortunately, large-scale RUBP production in-vitro has been limited to
these efforts discussed previously. More efforts are needed on this topic
to support valuable CO2 conversion via 3-PGA. Alternatively, G3P can be
used instead of 3-PGA, to produce valuable organic compounds via the
CBB pathway. The CBB pathway produces a G3P molecule as a
by-product every three turns of the cycle [46,50]. The released G3P then
participates in the partial glycolysis pathway to ultimately produce
biomass [244] (Fig. 9). Unlike the organic synthesis via 3-PGA in-vitro,
the G3P approach naturally accounts for the RUBP regeneration through
the CBB pathway. Indeed, the G3P approach for organic synthesis from
CO2 has been widely applied in-vivo (Section 5.4). However, the
full-scale implementation of this approach in-vitro will be challenging,
considering that the CBB pathway involves numerous enzymes (13 en-
zymes) and cofactors [245] (Fig. 2).

In summary, the production of organic compounds using RuBisCO
shows potential for high-value CO2 valorization. RuBisCO fixes CO2 into
RUBP to produce 3-PGA as the first stable intermediate. 3-PGA can then
participate in various central metabolic pathways to produce numerous
organic compounds (Fig. 10). Unfortunately, the conversion of 3-PGA to

useful organic compounds is complex (Fig. 10) and has had limited
success in-vivo [244]. While the in-vitro synthesis approach is relatively
more straightforward than the in-vivo approach and has a wider plethora
of available synthetic biology tools, the need for numerous enzymes, as
well as expensive substrates and cofactors, has greatly limited its
development [288–290]. Although in-vitro synthesis methods were
proposed for the production of RUBP in large quantities, the economic
feasibility of such routes had not been demonstrated. On the other hand,
numerous organic compounds can also be produced via G3P (Fig. 10).
Efforts for the in-vitro implementation of the CBB pathway are still
needed, to eventually develop a CCU system using RuBisCO that is
economically feasible.

7. Cofactor regeneration

The success of a cost-effective cell-free system for chemical biosyn-
thesis depends heavily on strategies to reduce the cost of expensive
substrates and cofactors. Strategies to reduce the cost of RuBisCO’s main
substrate, RUBP, involve either its synthesis from cheaper sources or its
regeneration via the CBB pathway. In both cases, as well as organic
compound synthesis via 3-PGA or G3P, expensive cofactors are required
[298] (Section 6). Unfortunately, ~50 % of known enzymes are cofactor
dependent [299]. Furthermore, some cofactors, such as ATP and NAD(P)
H are unstable and undergo degradation to produce inhibitory products
[300]. Thus, it is crucial to develop suitable cofactor regeneration sys-
tems to support large scale, high-value chemical biosynthesis using

enzymes. Although cofactor regeneration strategies are outside the
scope of this review, state-of-the-art regeneration strategies [294] are
briefly shown in this section to emphasize their critical role in the
development of a carbon neutral cell-free system for a valuable CO2
conversion.

Efficient in-situ cofactor regeneration has been identified as a
promising approach for the realization of economically feasible cell-free
systems for large-scale production [294]. In the in-situ approach, the
exposure time of the cofactor molecule is limited, thus reducing cofactor
degradation [300]. There are currently four in-situ NADH regeneration
strategies explored: the enzymatic, the electrochemical, the chemical,

and the photochemical regeneration [294] (Fig. 11). The enzymatic
strategy can be carried out either in-vivo or in-vitro and utilizes an
additional enzyme or enzyme complex to regenerate NADH. Among the
NADH regeneration strategies, the enzymatic strategy is preferred due to
its efficiency, reliability, reproducibility, and high turnover numbers
[294]. Meanwhile, the electrochemical regeneration strategy utilizes
redox reactions to directly (via electrodes) or indirectly (via organic or
organo-metallic mediators) regenerate NADH. Finally, the chemical and
photochemical regeneration strategies share a similar mechanism for
NADH regeneration by utilizing mediators as electron carriers and mo-
lecular hydrogen as an electron donor.

immobilized CBB pathway enzymes in multi-bed reactor [307] (c), and its three glassy electrode batch electrochemical reactor for NADH regeneration [307] (d).

On the other hand, ATP regeneration methods are either substrate-
level phosphorylation or oxidative phosphorylation [294] (Fig. 12). In
the substrate-level phosphorylation, phosphoryl donors such as adeno-
sine phosphate, PEP, DHAP, etc., undergo a phosphorylation reaction to
transfer phosphoryl groups to an ADP or an adenosine monophosphate
for ATP synthesis. In comparison to the oxidative phosphorylation that
utilizes inner membrane vesicles to mediate the phosphorylation reac-
tion, the substrate-level phosphorylation is considered more effective
and efficient [294]. The readers are referred to a recent review by Ulla
et al. [294] for a more detailed discussion of the NADH and ATP
regeneration strategies, and to Ref. [298] for a complete review of
cofactor regeneration.

8. Artificial photosynthesis

In previous sections, the potential of RuBisCO for CCU has been
highlighted through various efforts made to address its limitations
(Section 4), as well as through numerous applications of RuBisCO made
in the synthesis of organic compounds in-vivo (Section 5.4). The pro-
duction of valuable organic compounds involving RuBisCO is possible
through either the 3-PGA or the G3P pathways. However, inherent
metabolic constraints have limited a successful in-vivo application, while
the regeneration of expensive substrates and cofactors are crucial
limiting factors for industrial-scale chemical biosynthesis in-vitro

(Section 6). In this final section, recent examples of an in-vitro RuBisCO-
based system are discussed to highlight the current status of cell-free
RuBisCO-based systems in chemical biosynthesis. Photosynthesis has
been Nature’s gateway in producing useful organic compounds from
atmospheric CO2. As such, numerous efforts have recently been made to
mimic photosynthesis in-vitro, also known as artificial photosynthesis.
However, the majority of these efforts were focused on developing
advanced materials for CO2 conversion into simple organic compounds
[301–304]. Few have considered mimicking both light-dependent and
light-independent (CBB pathway) reactions to produce more complex
key organic intermediates such as 3-PGA [305–307], as discussed below.
In the latter case, the focus was on ATP generation from light using light
converting proteins, as well as on NADH regeneration, due to their high
cost [308,309].

A protein-based artificial system comprised of bacteriorhodopsin
(BR) and ATP synthase (ATPase) was used to regenerate ATP [305–307]
for the CBB pathway. Typically, BR is reconstituted into lipid vesicles
and coupled to ATPase, forming a BR-ATPase vesicle. In this vesicle, a
proton gradient is generated using BR that absorbs green light energy,
activating the ATP synthase and synthesizing ADP and inorganic phos-
phate [305,306]. Wendell et al. [305] were the first to couple an
ATPase-BR vesicle with purified enzyme constituents of the CBB
pathway to produce glucose (Fig. 13 (a)). The system was comprised of
three components: an ATP-regeneration system, a carbon fixation

system, and a glucose producing system. The system was embedded in a
foam architecture using a synthetic foam based on Ranaspumins-2 found
in the nest of the Tungara frog. Interestingly, the arrangement of en-
zymes in a foam architecture resulted in higher conversion efficiencies,
relative to those in free form [305]. Such an architecture caused a high
diffusion limitation within the structure, resulting in high local con-
centrations of the substrates needed for the reaction [305]. Later, Ren
et al. [306] utilized the concept of BR-ATPase vesicles to convert light
energy into ATP, to synthesize a cell-free artificial photosynthesis sys-
tem, using a PDMS microreactor (Fig. 13 (b)). The BR and ATPase were
embedded
poly(2-methyloxazoline)-block-poly
(dimethylsiloxane)-block-poly(2-methyloxazoline) triblock copolymer
vesicle, on the liquid-phase side of the microreactor under green light.
ATP was then generated in the liquid transparency gel and then diffused
into porous PDMS, where gaseous CO2 was introduced. Successful pro-
duction of glucose was demonstrated both under static flow (3.525
μg/mL, 4 h) and dynamic flow (5.559 μg/mL, 4 h) [306]. Finally, Ali
et al. [307] most recently coupled these BR-ATPase vesicles with an
NADH regenerating system to generate glucose, using immobilized en-
zymes from the CBB pathway. The enzymes were immobilized on hollow
fibers sequentially arranged as a multi-bed reactor (Fig. 13 (c)), while
the NADH regenerating system consisted of a glassy electrode batch
electrochemical reactor (Fig. 13 (d)). High recovery (97.5 %) was ach-
ieved using the NADH regeneration system, when subjected to a con-
(cid:0) 2.30V [307]. Although a successful
stant electrode potential of
proof-of-concept was achieved, the CO2 capture performance was
poor, due to a poor enzyme immobilization strategy which was not
disclosed [307].

9. Economic and environmental aspects of using RuBisCO in CO2
capture and utilization

Future CCU technologies must consider both economic and envi-
ronmental aspects to be viable long-term. Unfortunately, no economic
analysis is currently available in the literature for RuBisCO-based pro-
cesses. Discussions can therefore only be based on predictions of avail-
able bioprocess technologies. The economic aspect of using RuBisCO in
CCU will be strongly dependent on the chosen target compound upon
which the process will be based. Considering that biochemical systems
are currently limited to small titers (μg – mg/L [138]) and high cost,
with best estimates amounting to ~400–800 $/g for a considered pro-
duction rate of 175 kg/yr [139], fine chemicals should be considered as
target compounds due to their high prices (>10 $/kg) and low pro-
duction volumes requirements (<1000 Mg/yr) [310]. Therefore, further
conversion of simple organic compounds synthesized using RuBisCO
(Section 6) into fine chemicals will be necessary, with synthetic biology
playing a central role in engineering reaction pathways that lead to
economically viable processes. As with bioprocesses, the RuBisCO-based
process will involve a typical bioreactor unit which forms the heart of
the process, and ancillary unit operations which aim to provide the
optimal supporting environment for the proper functioning of the bio-
catalytic unit [234]. Depending on the complexity of the designed
pathway of the target product, a selection between whole-cell and
cell-free systems for the bioreactor unit will be a necessary first step,
followed by the ancillary unit operations.

Whole-cell is an inherently complex system comprised of intracel-
lular machinery that maintains optimal conditions for cell proliferation
and survival. While the all-inclusiveness of whole-cell systems makes
scaling-up feasible, their complexity makes engineering desired variants
challenging and time-consuming [311]. This is important considering
that the production of large titers is currently a limiting factor for their
wide-scale implementation, where current production capacities are in
the μg – mg/L range [138]. On the other hand, cell-free systems are
mainly comprised of isolated essential components of a desired pathway
that allows the mass transfer limitations due to the cell membrane to be
bypassed [312]. Furthermore, the isolation of the desired pathway

greatly reduces the complexity of the system, making their engineering
easier, faster, and more successful [311]. The challenge, however, lies in
its dependence on externally supplied substrates and cofactors, which
can be expensive to synthesize in-vitro. Indeed, the in-vitro synthesis of
RUBP substrates and cofactors is expected to be one of the main cost
contributors of the ancillary process of the cell-free bioreactor. Incor-
poration of recycling strategies will then be critical to achieving eco-
nomic viability of the process [313]. Alternatively, RUBP can be
produced from D-glucose [297]. This allows RUBP to be synthesized
from renewable biomass waste, although this introduces additional
steps into the system where additional enzymes and cofactor are
involved [314].

Despite its limitation in yield, the whole-cell system is currently
cheaper to implement than the cell-free system, especially with reaction
pathways that employ multiple enzymes and cofactors [139]. However,
the cell-free system becomes more economically advantageous with
higher production capacities. For instance, increasing the production
capacity of antibody drug conjugates to 175 kg/yr resulted in a 38 %
decrease in the overall cost of goods, 9 % lower than the reduction
needed to break-even with whole-cell system [139]. Furthermore, due to
the modularity of the cell-free system, the situation may soon change as
new developments to decrease the cost of cofactor and purified enzyme
synthesis have been rapid [311]. Currently, alternative strategies are
employed to increase the economic viability of cell-free systems. From
the CAPEX perspective, the production of recombinant enzymes using
E. coli is favorable, as it is suitable for large scale production (kg/yr)
[315]. Majority of the CAPEX cost will then be due to cell extraction (47
%) and optimized biological reagents (22 %), which can be dramatically
reduced by increasing production capacity [139]. From the OPEX
perspective, enzyme immobilization will be crucial in extending the
operational stability of enzymes. However, this is expected to add a
factor of 4 increase in OPEX when considering the simplest immobili-
zation strategy (physical adsorption) [316].

Finally, from an environmental perspective, in-vitro preparation of
were identified as hotspots in the
cofactors such as ATP and NAD
production of L-serine using cell-free RuBisCO-based technology [140].
ATP was used for the synthesis of RUBP from R-5-P, while NAD
was
used for the conversion of 3-PGA to L-serine. A system that includes ATP
regeneration from ADP was shown to reduce the carbon footprint of its
production by 17.7–38.3 %, although the carbon footprint of this system
was still higher than the conventional route [140]. It was estimated that
the regeneration of NAD
from NADH will reduce the carbon footprint
of the system below that of the conventional chemical process [140].
This stresses the crucial role of cofactor regeneration in minimizing the
carbon footprint and economics of a RuBisCO-based system. Meanwhile,
the ability to reuse the biocatalytic system allowed the use of nano-
particle immobilized RuBisCO to have a relatively low carbon footprint
(0.47–13.24 kg CO2-equiv./kg serine), despite the isolation of
camptothecin-dipeptide nanotubes being a carbon intensive process
with low yield [317]. Once the regeneration system was implemented,
the carbon footprint resulting from the nanostructure-RuBisCO complex
was identified as a new hotspot for the carbon footprint. However, most
of the footprint originates from the nanostructure, and the use of cel-
lulose and chitin nanofibers was suggested to reduce the economic and
environmental cost of the said complex.

10. Challenges and future directions

RuBisCO has been viewed as an intriguing enzyme due to its central
role in photosynthesis, a critical process on which all life on Earth de-
pends, despite its reputation of being catalytically slow and inefficient.
Such reputation is rather unfair, as its catalytic properties are often
directly compared with the diffusion-limited CA, causing it to be
constantly overlooked for CCU applications. However, a more general
comparison of RuBisCO with other major carboxylase classes and known
enzymes shows that its kinetic properties are standard, with an even

28

K.D. Cocon and P. Luis

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 105 (2024) 101184

higher rate enhancement than CA, as it catalyzes a CO2 conversion re-
(cid:0)
action more complex than the hydration of CO2 to HCO3
. Considering
that different enzymes catalyze different types of reactions, there is no
single best enzyme to develop CCU applications. Instead, focus should be
placed on expanding the product portfolio of CO2 conversion using
enzymatic systems. The selection for such systems should then be based
not only on typical reported kinetic properties, but also on rate
enhancement. Developing a system based on RuBisCO for CO2 conver-
sion into organic compounds is therefore worthwhile, despite its kinetic
limitations.

Synthetic biology tools have played a central role in improving
RuBisCO’s catalytic properties to support wide-scale adaptation. In
particular, RuBisCO engineering has heavily focused on using directed
evolution and rational engineering to generate RuBisCO variants with
enhanced catalytic efficiency and substrate specificity, to generate
climate-resistant and sustainable crops with improved photosynthetic
efficiency and crop yield. Engineering plant RuBisCO has been greatly
hindered by the current limited understanding of its biogenesis, where
complex and coordinated action of extensive chaperones is required for
its successful expression [318]. With the recent success in RuBisCO
expression in E. coli, large selection and testing is now possible. How-
ever, the efficient validation of positive variants in plants is still un-
derdeveloped. Current method employs a homologous recombination to
integrate mutated genes into the chloroplast plastomes, which is a
time-consuming process. On the other hand, two main strategies have
emerged to address RuBisCO’s oxygen sensitivity: the algal CCM mim-
(cid:0)
icry through the expression of HCO3
transporters, or the cyanobacterial
CCM mimicry through the expression of carboxysome in the chloroplast.
Finally, pathway engineering has been employed to design an
augmented photorespiration pathway that does not lead to carbon loss.
Despite some success in this area, successful expression and validation in
plants remains a challenge. These challenges highlight the need for a
better understanding of the folding and assembly of RuBisCO to support
its engineering.

On the other hand, enzyme immobilization and mimicry present as
practical alternative approaches to synthetic biology to obtain RuBisCO
with enhanced properties. Enzyme immobilization presents a more
attractive alternative, as it is relatively simpler to implement and helps
reduce the cost of the process by minimizing enzyme losses, maximizing
its operating stability, and eliminating the downstream enzyme recovery
process. However, current immobilization strategies either only improve
thermal stability but reduce enzyme activity after immobilization (i.e.,
covalent bonding) or slightly enhance activity but offer no thermal
stability (i.e., encapsulation). Considering that applications may involve
gases at high temperature (e.g., post-combustion CCU), developing co-
valent bonding as a strategy for immobilizing RuBisCO could be inter-
esting, as it offers long-term stability under denaturing conditions.

Current CCU applications involving RuBisCO have been mainly
limited to in-vivo applications. RuBisCO’s role in photosynthesis has
made it a target for the engineering of climate-resistant and efficient
crops as a means of sequestering CO2 in the soil. The production of useful
chemicals using RuBisCO has been mostly done through whole-cell
systems that are engineered to express the target pathway however,
product yields are still far from meeting industrial demands. Although
the presence of integrated machineries responsible for ensuring cell
survival and proliferation has made whole-cell systems scalable, such
ancillary pathways consume resources that would otherwise be used by
the cell for the production of the target product. Mass transfer limita-
tions in cell membranes, and generation of toxic intermediates are some
of the key challenges that need to be addressed to achieve high yield. In-
vitro cell-free systems are an interesting alternative due to their potential
to meet industrial production capacity, but they are greatly hindered by
the associated cost of using purified enzymes and cofactors. Cost-
efficient effective enzyme immobilization techniques and efficient
cofactor regeneration techniques will be critical for the wide-scale
adaptation of cell-free systems.

The regeneration of NADH and ATP is a critical step for which
several strategies are being developed. Among the strategies currently
explored, the use of a multi-enzymatic system for NADH and ATP
regeneration was identified as the best. Nevertheless, obtaining stable,
highly active enzymes under in-vitro conditions is currently not possible,
and designing a cofactor regeneration system needs to be highly specific
to avoid interference with the main reaction pathway being considered.
On the contrary, the enzymatic approach of ATP regeneration utilizes
the same pathway as organic biosynthesis via 3-PGA or G3P (i.e.,
glycolysis). Hence, designing a specific reaction pathway that accounts
for both product synthesis and ATP regeneration could be advantageous.
In any case, the design of a carbon-neutral cofactor regeneration system
is necessary for a truly carbon-neutral CO2 to organic synthesis pathway
for anthropogenic carbon mitigation. Nevertheless, preliminary tech-
noeconomic analysis must first be carried out to identify the most suit-
able target product and system (whole-cell or cell-free) to meet market
demand. Furthermore, it will identify hotspots that can be optimized to
make the process economically viable. Although whole-cell systems are
currently economically advantageous, especially when involving
complicated reaction pathways, the modularity of the cell-free system
permits rapid developments that could result in a competitive process in
the near future.

Recent progress in synthetic biology focused on the development of
tools that either allow improvements in the native CO2 fixing pathway,
design a synthetic CO2 fixing pathway, or a combination of both [319].
Of particular interest is the CRISPR gene editing method, which allows
markerless editing to be possible, making metabolic engineering in
cyanobacteria dramatically more efficient [320]. Its application in
photosynthetic hosts such as cyanobacteria has been greatly limited
however, due to the toxicity of the Cas9 protein. Nevertheless, a recent
discovery has uncovered an endonuclease, Cpf1, that is better tolerated
by photosynthetic hosts [321]. Further developments in the use of Cpf1
will result in the availability of engineering tools for photosynthetic
chemical production and will make them viable for biochemical pro-
duction. An alternative gene editing, CRISPR inhibition, uses dead a
Cas9 (dCas9) protein to repress the activity of specific genes without
making permanent changes in the DNA sequence, and thus allows for
reversible and tunable gene regulation [322]. This makes them more
advantageous than the traditional gene knockout methods that induce
permanent changes or disruption in the DNA sequence of a target gene.
Although the utility of dCas9 is more limited than traditional
CRISPR/Cas9, dCas9 has been shown to be well tolerated in photosyn-
thetic hosts, which makes it invaluable in applications where traditional
gene knockouts are toxic [323].

Finally, recent developments in machine learning techniques in
system biology, which use both genetic sequence information and
structural data, have led to enhancements in the creation of libraries of
genetic sequences that are more likely to exhibit the desired functional
characteristics [324]. These improved libraries thus enable a more
efficient exploration of the sequence-function landscape, facilitating the
discovery and optimization of strains for CCU [324]. Thus, synthetic
biology will be central in realizing efficient CO2 conversion pathways to
increase its product portfolio.

11. Conclusions

In this review, the potential of RuBisCO as a biocatalyst for CCU was
comprehensively evaluated by considering both its enzymatic properties
and potential
implications for industrial-scale processes. Although
RuBisCO has been constantly overlooked because of its unremarkable
catalytic properties, this review shows that it has higher rate enhance-
ment than the diffusion-limited CA.

Among the existing enzymatic CO2 conversion pathways, the CBB
pathway is the most attractive for the production of high-value com-
pounds, due to: i) its natural occurrence that eliminates the need for
extensive engineering; ii) its integrated substrate regeneration thanks to

29

K.D. Cocon and P. Luis

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 105 (2024) 101184

the circular nature of the pathway; and, iii) its ability to produce a
valuable organic intermediate, 3-PGA. However, the first step of the CBB
pathway is catalyzed by RuBisCO, which initially evolved in an O2-
deprived atmosphere. As O2 increased to current levels, RuBisCO
reached a structural constraint, causing its well-known slow kinetics and
poor CO2/O2 selectivity (tradeoff between kcat and Kc). This has made
RuBisCO a target of engineering for developing variants or systems with
enhanced catalytic properties, with main applications focused on
enhancing the photosynthetic efficiency of plants. Engineered hetero-
trophs have been used as host organisms for improved RuBisCO variants.
However, the production capacity has been limited to low titers, which
is insufficient to be considered for industrial scale. Metabolic engi-
neering of efficient pathways is thus critically needed to increase pro-
duction titers to industrial-scale capacity.

At the process level, initial attempts to develop RuBisCO-integrated
processes to perform artificial photosynthesis are underway. Success-
ful scaling-up of the process would depend heavily on the nature of
chemicals being produced and the process design to minimize cost.
Cofactors are expected to comprise the majority of the total cost.
Therefore, the incorporation of cofactor regeneration systems and the
target of fine chemical production will be the key to economic viability
while simultaneously improving the sustainability of the process.

It can be concluded that RuBisCO can play an important role in the
valorization of CO2 into high value products, provided that its catalytic
limitations are addressed effectively at the enzyme level, and efficient
metabolic pathways and regeneration systems are developed at the
process level.
