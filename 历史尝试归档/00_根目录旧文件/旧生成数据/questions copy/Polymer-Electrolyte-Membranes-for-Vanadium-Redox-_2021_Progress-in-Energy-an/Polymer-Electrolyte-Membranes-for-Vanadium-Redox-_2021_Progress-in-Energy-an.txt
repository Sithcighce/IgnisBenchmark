Electrochemical energy storage systems are considered as one of the most viable solutions to realize 
large-scale utilization of renewable energy. Among the various electrochemical energy storage systems, 
ﬂow batteries have increasingly attracted global attention due to their ﬂexible structural design, high 
eﬃciencies, long operating life cycle, and independently tunable power and energy storage capacity. Al- 
though promising, a number of challenges including the high cost of ﬂow battery materials hinder the 
broad market penetration of ﬂow battery technology. Polymer electrolyte membrane, as a key component 
in ﬂow batteries providing pathways for charge carriers transport and preventing electrolytes crossover, 
takes over 25% of the entire cost of the battery system. Apparently, the membrane not only plays pivotal 
roles in the operation characteristics of a ﬂow battery, but also largely inﬂuences the ﬁnancial cost of 
the battery system. To provide insights and better understanding of membranes towards enhancing their 
performance and cost-effectiveness, we therefore present recent advances and research outcomes on the 
development of polymer electrolyte membranes as well as their applications in ﬂow batteries, particularly 
all-vanadium redox ﬂow batteries. Various aspects of polymer electrolyte membranes including functional 
requirements, characterization methods, materials screening and preparation strategies, transport mech- 
anisms, and commercialization progress are presented. Finally, perspectives for future trends on research 
and development of polymer electrolyte membranes with relevance to ﬂow batteries are highlighted.

1. Introduction 

The continuous usage of ineﬃcient (fossil) fuels in tandem with 
the ever-increasing and energy-consuming activities in the present 
society has led to severe energy crisis and environmental pollu- 
tion, thereby necessitating the needs to deploy unconventional, yet 
eﬃcient, energy sources. Renewable energy sources, such as wind 
and solar, have been widely recognized as sustainable alternatives 
towards achieving clean energy and reliable electricity generation 
[1–4] . However, due to the intermittent nature of these renewable 
energy sources, their grid applications for continuous and reliable 
power supply are still constrained [5–9] . To address this issue, sev- 
eral energy storage technologies including compressed air, pumped 
hydro, supercapacitors, and solid-state batteries have been devel- 
oped over the years. However, the site-dependence and high ﬁnan- 
cial implications of compressed air and pumped hydro, low storage 
capacity  and  high  self-discharge  rate  of  supercapacitors,  thermal 
runaway effect and safety challenges of lithium-ion batteries, and 
short life cycle and inherent hazards of lead-acid batteries signif- 
icantly limit the widespread and large-scale applications of these 

technologies [7,10–14] . The quest to resolve these challenges there- 
fore led to the revolution of electrochemical energy storage sys- 
tems through the emergence of ﬂow battery technology. 

The various advantages of ﬂow battery systems positioned them 
as one of the most promising technologies suitable for large-scale 
electrochemical energy storage applications. One of the major ad- 
vantages  of  ﬂow  batteries  is  their  independently  tunable  energy 
and  power  capacity.  Unlike  conventional  batteries  whose  energy 
and power capacity are both dependent on the electrode proper- 
ties, the energy capacity of ﬂow batteries solely depends on the 
volume and concentration of their electrolyte solution, while the 
power capacity is a function of the porous electrode geometry and 
the number of cells available in the stack [15,16] . In addition, ﬂow 
batteries exhibit short response time as they store electrical energy 
using two different types of redox couple as electroactive species. 
Structural design ﬂexibility and long-term operation with cycling 
stability are some other advantages of ﬂow batteries. Attracted by 
the above-mentioned advantages and other intriguing characteris- 
tics, different types of ﬂow battery technology such as aqueous re- 
dox ﬂow batteries (RFBs) [17–24] , hybrid ﬂow batteries, [25,26] or-

Polymer  electrolyte  membrane  is  one  of  the  key  components 
in ﬂow batteries which plays signiﬁcant roles on the performance 
and  cost  of  ﬂow  batteries.  During  the  operation  of  a  ﬂow  bat- 
tery,  membrane  physically  separates  two  half-cells,  functionally 
conducts charge-carrier, minimizes cross-contamination, and pre- 
vents  short-circuit  [49,50] .  However,  it  has  been  analyzed  that 
polymer electrolyte membranes often claim over a quarter of the 
total  capital  cost  of  a  ﬂow  battery  system  [51] .  Hence,  the  se- 
lection  and  synthesis  of  membrane  materials,  as  well  as  mem- 
brane designs and preparations, are crucially important for achiev- 
ing  a  high-performance,  and  cost-effective  ﬂow  battery.  Up  till 
now,  several  types  of  polymer  electrolyte  membrane  have  been 
developed  for  ﬂow  battery  applications  and  are  generally  clas- 
siﬁed  into:  cation-exchange  membranes,  anion-exchange  mem- 
branes,  amphoteric-ion  exchange  membranes  and  porous  mem- 
branes  based  on  the  type  of  ﬁxed  charges  present  in  their  ma- 
trix structures [52] . Thus, the identiﬁcation, understanding and de- 
velopment of appropriate polymer electrolyte membranes that of- 
fer an optimal balance between performance and cost is currently 
one  of  major  concerns  for  the  global  development  of  ﬂow  bat- 
teries.  To  date,  a  few  review  papers  [50,52–61]  have  been  pub- 
lished  to  summarize  the  various  types  of  membranes  that  have 
been developed for use in ﬂow batteries. Some of the previously 
published  review  papers,  however,  mainly  focused  on  a  speciﬁc 
type  of  membranes,  for  instance  porous  membranes  [50,55] ,  or 
anion-exchange  membranes  [57,62] ,  hence  they  did  not  capture 
other types of membrane employed in ﬂow batteries. Elsewhere, 
Li et al. [54] discussed ion exchange membranes without includ- 
ing the amphoteric-ion exchange membranes. Even though a num- 
ber of reviews [52,58,59,61] discussed the development of cation 
and anion-exchange membranes, amphoteric-ion exchange mem- 
branes,  and  porous  membranes;  detailed  understanding  on  the 
transport phenomena, performance evaluations, cost and commer- 
cialization progress of these membranes were not considered. Shin 
et  al.  [56]  also  reviewed  some  membrane  candidates  appropri- 
ate for non-aqueous redox ﬂow batteries. Apparently, discussions 
on materials selection for polymer electrolyte membranes are not 
suﬃcient in all these reviews. Other than this, the ﬂow batteries 
have received increasing attentions and signiﬁcant progress in re- 
cent years, particularly for membrane research and development. 
Consequently, a timely and contemporary review of polymer elec- 
trolyte membranes for ﬂow batteries is of vital importance for in- 
formation and knowledge update. This article therefore presents a 
comprehensive review on the recent advances and developments 
of  polymer  electrolyte  membranes  and  their  applications  in  all- 
vanadium redox ﬂow batteries. 

2. The focus of the article 

The  widespread  commercialization  of  ﬂow  batteries  still  en- 
counters some critical issues and challenges. Elimination of these 
lingering  barriers  demands  a  rudimentary  understanding  of  the 
key material components, such as membrane, in ﬂow battery sys- 
tems. To this end, a comprehensive review on the latest advances 
and developments of polymer electrolyte membranes for ﬂow bat- 
teries  which  covers  several  aspects  on  membrane  research  and 
development  is  needed.  Hence,  this  article  focuses  on  the  vari- 
ous types of polymer electrolyte membrane employed in the de- 
sign  and  operation  of  ﬂow  batteries,  particularly  for  VRFBs.  The 
characterization methods both at membrane and cell levels, state- 
of-the-art  membrane  materials  with  their  properties  and  perfor- 
mances,  and  transport  mechanisms  of  electroactive  species  and 
water  across  the  polymer  electrolyte  membranes  are  discussed. 
The  current  advances  and  research  outcomes  on  the  develop- 
ment of these membranes are comprehensively reviewed towards 
stimulating rational designs and development of high-performance

ganic ﬂow batteries [4,27–36] and semi-solid ﬂow batteries [37–
39] have been developed and investigated [40–44] . 

A typical ﬂow battery system, as shown in Fig. 1 , comprises a 
cell, two external electrolyte tanks (for electrolytes storage), pumps 
(for electrolyte delivery into the cell), and other accessories [7,16] . 
A single cell generally comprises a positive electrode and a neg- 
ative electrode separated by a polymer electrolyte membrane. In 
terms of redox couples or battery chemistries, several types of ﬂow 
batteries,  including  but  not  limited  to  all-vanadium  redox  ﬂow 
battery  (VRFB),  zinc-bromine,  iron-chromium,  and  polysulﬁde- 
bromine  ﬂow  batteries  have  been  proposed.  Among  them,  the 
VRFB is the most well-studied and developed ﬂow battery tech- 
nology  for  large-scale  energy  storage  due  to  the  use  of  vana- 
dium in its two electrolyte solutions. This therefore prevents cross- 
contamination of electrolytes, a major challenge, which is seem- 
ingly  unavoidable  in  other  ﬂow  battery  chemistries.  As  a  result 
of this unique feature, VRFBs boost of high round-trip eﬃciency, 
long  operating  life  cycle  (above  20  0 0 0  cycles)  [45] ,  low  main- 
tenance  cost,  low  environmental  footprint  and  toxicity,  and  ef- 
fortless  recycling  of  electrolytes  compared  to  several  other  en- 
ergy storage technologies [46–48] . VRFBs are, however, not with- 
out their challenges and shortcomings, such as degradation of ma- 
terials and capacity, low power and energy density, and high cap- 
ital cost, which currently limit the widespread application of this 
technology.  Hence, more attention  on the  research and develop- 
ment on VRFBs materials such as fabrication of new membranes, 
advancing electrodes properties, and improving electrolyte compo- 
sition are essentially required for performance enhancement, cost- 
effectiveness, and widespread commercialization.

mance of these membranes, as well as their cost and commercial- 
ization  progress  at  membrane-  and  battery-levels  are  presented.

relevance to ﬂow batteries are highlighted.

trolyte membranes for ﬂow battery applications. Section 4 presents

trolyte  membrane and their preparation methods.  Section 6  dis-

progress  of  ﬂow  battery  technology.  Finally,  Section  9  highlights 
the  remaining  challenges  and  future  perspectives  necessary  for 
performance enhancement of polymer electrolyte membranes and 
ﬂow battery systems. 

3. Functional requirements 

Over  the  years,  several  types  of  ﬂow  battery  have  been  pro- 
posed and studied. According to the types of electrolyte used and 
the  structural  design,  ﬂow  battery  technology  can  be  primarily 
classiﬁed into aqueous, hybrid, organic, and semi-solid. The VRFB 
is the most developed aqueous RFB system and has received many 
successful installations and applications in several countries. It has 
also been widely studied and broadly investigated using different 
types of membrane. Hence, this section speciﬁcally highlights the 
functional requirements of membranes suitable for application in 
VRFBs. One of such requirements is high ionic conductivity. It has 
been widely reported that membranes with high ionic conductiv- 
ity provide VRFBs with low ohmic loss [63] , which is crucially im- 
portant towards reducing polarization loss under high current den- 
sity operation [64] . In the meanwhile, low membrane permeability 
to electroactive species is also of paramount importance as it is 
closely related to vanadium-ion crossover phenomenon, which of- 
ten leads to system capacity loss [65] . Hence, it is required of the 
membrane  employed  in  VRFBs  to  be  effectively  selective  to  dis- 
tinguish protons from vanadium ions, thereby maintaining a bal- 
anced ionic conductivity and vanadium-ion permeability for high 
eﬃciency and stable cycle performance [7,50,54,66] . Moreover, the 
polymer  electrolyte  membrane  for  VRFBs  should  also  be  able  to 
suppress  the  preferential  transport  of  water  between  two  half- 
cells for proper electrolyte balance, to avoid dilution/ﬂooding and 
precipitation/over concentration of electrolyte solutions. A certain 
level of mechanical strength is another essential requirement for a 
membrane to be used in VRFBs. Such mechanical property would 
not only inﬂuences the assembling process of the battery, but also 
contributes to the system durability. Other essential requirements 
including thermal and chemical stabilities are also necessary for an 
ideal polymer electrolyte membrane in VRFBs to attain widespread 
applications and commercialization [46,52] . All these functional re- 
quirements therefore signiﬁcantly contribute to the performance of 
the membrane as well as the entire battery system as discussed in 
the following section. 

4. Performance indicators 

Polymer electrolyte membrane is an indispensable component 
in ﬂow batteries, which not only separates the catholyte and the 
anolyte  to  prevent  their  mixing,  but  also  provides  channels  for 
ionic transport to complete the electrical circuit and ensure elec- 
troneutrality. Nowadays, the most widely used polymer electrolyte 

membranes  for  ﬂow  batteries  are  the  commercial  Naﬁon  series 
membranes [67] , which possess excellent proton conductivity and 
chemical stability. However, the high crossover rate of electroactive 
species and high cost of these membranes are major concerns in- 
ﬂuencing their application in ﬂow batteries [68–70] . It is therefore 
of  paramount  importance  to  develop  polymer  electrolyte  mem- 
branes that offer superior performance at membrane and cell lev- 
els  while  fulﬁlling  affordable-cost  requirement.  To  systematically 
and accurately characterize polymer electrolyte membranes, vari- 
ous methods have been developed and applied to evaluate their 
performance at both membrane- and cell-levels. In this section, the 
generally accepted methods and testing conditions for membrane 
characterizations with the typical reported value range of Naﬁon 
series are summarized. 

4.1. Membrane level 

4.1.1. Ionic conductivity 

As previously mentioned, one of the most important functions 
of a polymer electrolyte membrane in VRFBs is to provide path- 
ways  for  charge  carriers  so  as  to  complete  the  electrical  circuit. 
Hence, ionic conductivity, which indicates the smooth transport of 
charge carriers through polymer electrolyte membranes, is consid- 
ered as a major indicator for membrane performance evaluation. 
A high ionic conductivity therefore reveals that charge carriers can 
easily transport through the membrane, which in turn results to a 
high voltage eﬃciency. On the other hand, membranes with low 
ionic  conductivity  causes  large  internal  resistance  and  thus  lim- 
its the battery performance, especially at high discharging current 
densities. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy is the most 
widely used method for evaluating the ionic conductivity ( σ ) of 
membranes [71,72] :

where S,  d,  and  R  represent  the  effective  area,  thickness  of  the 
membrane, and the impedance, respectively. To date, several con- 
ﬁgurations, such as two-probe and four-probe systems as demon- 
strated in Refs. [67,73,74] , have been developed to determine the 
ionic conductivity of membranes used in VRFBs. It is worth men- 
tioning  that,  while  many  studies  conducted  the  ionic  conductiv- 
ity test of membranes in deionized water [75–77] , some have also 
performed the test in sulfuric acid [67,78] or vanadium electrolyte 
[79] which is the actual scenario during the operation of VRFBs. 
Considering the real operating condition in VRFBs, the evaluation 
of membrane conductivity using vanadium electrolyte would pro- 
vide  substantial  information  relevant  to  membranes  used  in  the 
battery  system.  The  most  widely  used  Naﬁon  series  membranes 
possess  excellent  ionic  conductivity,  which  has  been  mostly  re- 
ported  to  be  within  the  range  of  50-100  mS  cm −1  [67,75,80] . 
Therefore, to ensure rapid and smooth ionic transport via a mem- 
brane to be employed in a VRFB, such membrane is required to 
have a comparable ionic conductivity to that of the Naﬁon series. 

4.1.2. Water/Electrolyte uptake 

The  water  uptake  (WU)  ratio  of  a  polymer  electrolyte  mem- 
brane indicates its capability to absorb water. This is an important 
parameter for evaluating the performance of membranes such as 
Naﬁon as water uptake commonly leads to the dissociation of the 
ion pairs between the ﬁxed ion exchange group and movable ions 
[81] , and therefore has a major inﬂuence on the membrane ionic 
conductivity and permeability. Considering the aqueous electrolyte 
environment within the cell, WU therefore plays signiﬁcant roles 
on the performance of membranes used in VRFBs. The water up- 
take ratio of a membrane is not only inﬂuenced by the hydrophilic 
property of its polymer matrix and morphology, but also the den- 
sity of polymer network [82] . Normally, the water uptake ratio is 

4

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 85 (2021) 100926 

measured by ﬁrst immersing a dry membrane into deionized wa- 
ter, afterwards the change in the membrane weight is calculated 
using [69,83] : 

Water uptake ( % ) = 

W W − W 
d 
W 
d 

× 100% 

(2) 

W and W 

where W 
d are the weight of the wet and dry membrane, 
respectively. Many investigations have shown that an increase in 
the water uptake ratio of a membrane enhances its ionic conduc- 
tivity as well as vanadium-ion permeability. However, this can also 
result in poor mechanical properties and stability of the membrane 
[84–86] . The Naﬁon series membranes have been tested and re- 
ported  to  have  a  water  uptake  ratio  within  20-40  %  [69,76,77] . 
While such water uptake ratio facilitates the transport of protons 
through the membrane, the Naﬁon series membranes are exposed 
to high permeability of active species and undesired effects. There- 
fore, the membranes prepared for RFBs are desired to possess an 
optimized  water  uptake  ratio  in  order  to  attain  an  optimal  bal- 
ance among other properties mentioned above. However, it is also 
worth to mention that, while many studies investigated the wa- 
ter  uptake  ratio  of  membranes,  even  for  membranes  applied  in 
VRFBs, some researchers have examined the electrolyte uptake ra- 
tio of membrane [87] . The electrolyte uptake is measured using the 
same strategy as water uptake ratio while simply replacing the wa- 
ter with vanadium electrolyte solution. Considering the real oper- 
ating condition in VRFBs, electrolyte uptake would provide better 
and substantial value relevant to membrane properties. 

4.1.3. Ion exchange capacity (IEC) 

Similar  to  the  water  uptake  ratio,  the  ion  exchange  capacity 
(IEC) is another prominent parameter that inﬂuences the ionic con- 
ductivity  and  vanadium-ion  permeability  of  polymer  electrolyte 
membranes. IEC quantiﬁes the ability of a membrane to provide 
paths for ions transport. This is primarily determined by the num- 
ber of ion-exchange functional groups present in the polymer elec- 
trolyte membrane [88] . In VRFBs, insuﬃcient ions transport across 
a  membrane,  as  a  result  of  low  ion  exchange  capacity,  leads  to 
large ohmic loss and further limits the overall battery performance 
[89] . Hence, it is essential for the ion exchange membranes to pos- 
sess high IEC so as to ensure superior battery performance. The 
IEC  is  often  determined  using  titration  method  as  described  in 
Refs.  [90–92]  The  aqueous  solutions  employed  for  IEC  measure- 
ment  of  cation-exchange  membranes  and  anion-exchange  mem- 
branes are typically different. For cation-exchange membranes, the 
mostly used aqueous solutions for the IEC measurement are NaCl 
and  NaOH.  The  measurement  is  conducted  by  weighing  the  dry 
membrane and then immersing it into NaCl solution for 24 hours 
to completely exchange H + in the membrane with Na + . After that, 
NaOH  solution  is  used  for  titration  to  determine  the  amount  of 
H +  released from the membrane. The IEC of the cation-exchange 
membrane is thus calculated using [76,93,94] : 

IEC = 

V NaOH × C NaOH 
W 
d 

(3) 

where C NaOH and V NaOH represent the concentration and volume of 
d represents 
NaOH solution used for titration, respectively, while W 
the weight of dry membrane. 

3  and  AgNO 

On  the  other  hand,  NaNO 

3  solutions  are  mostly 
used  for  determining  the  IEC  of  anion-exchange  membranes.  In 
this case, the anion-exchange membranes are ﬁrst immersed into 
3  solution  for  24-48  hours  to  completely  release  Cl ¯
the  NaNO 
ions from the membrane. After this, the AgNO 
3  solution is used 
to  titrate  the  released  Cl ¯ ions.  The  IEC  is  thus  calculated  using 
[95,96] : 

IEC = 

V AgN O 3 × C AgN O 3

where C

3  solution used for titration, respectively. It has been re- 
ported in literatures that the IEC of Naﬁon series membranes is 
between 0.85-0.95 mmol g −1  [76,97,98] . For the cation-exchange 
membranes, high IEC facilitates proton transport, even though it 
may  also  increase  the  permeability  of  active  species  across  the 
membrane. It is thus important for the membranes employed in 
RFBs to possess a suitable IEC value that allows high ionic conduc- 
tivity while reducing the crossover rate of electroactive species. 

4.1.4. Vanadium-ion permeability/diffusivity 

The transport of vanadium ions through the polymer electrolyte 
membrane  in  a  ﬂow  battery  not  only  causes  self-discharge,  but 
also inﬂuences the cycling stability of the battery. In addition, it 
may also lead to membrane fouling, which generally occurs during 
long-term  operation,  especially  for  cation-exchange  membranes. 
For vanadium-based electrolytes, two types of fouling mechanism 
have  been  reported,  which  are  cation  deposition  on  membrane 
surface  and  cation  accumulation  inside  proton-conducting  chan- 
nels  [99] .  Such  phenomena  can  further  reduce  ionic  conductiv- 
ity  of  membrane  and  also  increase  membrane  resistance,  which 
in turn result in the degradation of battery system. Many studies 
have shown that high crossover rate of vanadium ions through the 
membrane results in self-discharge, low coulombic eﬃciency, and 
poor cycle stability of the battery [100–102] . It is therefore crucial 
to examine the permeability of membranes to vanadium ions. 

During the operation of VRFBs, the transport of different species 
including water,  vanadium ions, and protons are highly coupled. 
Regarding the vanadium ions, not only VO 2 + and VO 
+ ions trans- 
2 
port through the membrane from the positive side to the nega- 
tive side of the battery, V 2 +  and V 3 +  ions also transport through 
the  membrane  in  the  reverse  direction.  Hence,  the  comprehen- 
sive study of the permeabilities of each vanadium ion should be 
regarded  with  equal  importance.  Over  the  years,  several  studies 
have examined the permeabilities of these vanadium ions and each 
vanadium-ion has been reported with its diffusivity [101,103,104] , 
which is slightly different from that of other vanadium ions, at- 
tributed to their different ion sizes and carried charges [105] . Fur- 
thermore, it is also found that different studies have reported dif- 
ferent values and trends for the permeability of these vanadium 
ions, which may be attributed to the different membrane compo- 
sitions and structures in those studies [101,106] . However, it is also 
worth  to  mention  that,  while  some  studies  evaluated  the  mem- 
brane permeability of different vanadium ions, many studies still 
examined the vanadium-ion permeability of membrane using elec- 
trolyte containing only VO 2 + ions, due to the fact that VO 2 + ions 
possess the best stability in the open air and therefore allows the 
easy  and  precise  concentration  examination  during  permeability 
measurement. In more details, the vanadium-ion permeability test 
is  commonly  conducted  using  VOSO 
4  solution,  where  the  mem- 
brane is ﬁrst placed between two separate reservoirs each ﬁlled 
4 solution, respectively, as shown in Fig. 2 
with VOSO 
(a). Thereafter, the solution samples are collected from the reser-

voir with MgSO 
4 solution at regular time-intervals to measure the 
concentration of VO 2 + for calculation [107,109] . The formula used 
for vanadium-ion permeability (P) calculation is given as [109,110] :

in  the  compartment.  C 
other  compartment  containing  VO 2 +  at  the  beginning.  A  and  L 
are  effective  area  and  thickness  of  the  membrane,  respectively. 
Mostly, the Naﬁon series membranes have been reported to have a 
vanadium-ion permeability within the range of 30 0-40 0 ×10 −8 cm 2 
min −1 , which is relatively high and therefore results in fast capac- 
ity degradation during battery operation [91,102] . In comparison, 
some modiﬁed Naﬁon membranes have been reported with much 
lower  vanadium  ions  permeability  of  <  100  × 10 −8  cm 2  min −1 
[68,111,112] . However, it is worth noting that, for a membrane with 
a low crossover rate of vanadium ions, it may also possess a lim- 
ited ionic conductivity, which further limits the voltage eﬃciency. 
Therefore, it is of vital importance to achieve an optimal balance 
between  ionic  conductivity  and  crossover  rate  of  membranes.  In 
essence, the ideal polymer electrolyte membrane for ﬂow batteries 
is  desired  to  simultaneously  possess  high  ionic  conductivity  and 
low permeability of vanadium ions for performance improvement 
of both membrane and battery. 

4.1.5. Chemical stability 

The chemical stability of a polymer electrolyte membrane in- 
dicates its capability to withstand the extreme chemical environ- 
ment within the cell of a battery system. It is essential for polymer 
electrolyte membranes used in ﬂow batteries to possess superior 
chemical stability so as to minimize membrane degradation and 
ensure long-term cycling operation of the battery. As pointed out 
by previous studies, the oxidation of polymer is one of the major 
reasons for membrane degradation. For instance, in VRFBs, the cor- 
rosive electrolytes may react with the membrane which could re- 
sult to side reactions during charge and discharge processes. Such 
reactions often reduce the concentration of electroactive species in 
the electrolyte and further lead to capacity loss. Apart from this, 
+ 
the degradation of the membrane due to severe oxidation by VO 
2 
ions  in  the  electrolyte  can  also  result  in  poor  stability  both  for 
the  membrane  and  the  battery  [113] .  A  detailed  analysis  of  the 
degradation  processes  of  sulfonated  poly(sulfone)  membranes  in 
VRFB  system  was  presented  by  Kim  et  al.  [114] .  After  50  cycles 
of operation, utilizing the energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, a 
band  with  high  vanadium  and  low  sulfur  content  was  observed 
on the membrane surface, which was found to correspond to the 
loss of sulfonate SO 
2  stretch as shown in a Raman spectroscopy. 
Such result demonstrated the chemical degradation of the mem- 
brane, while the cyclic formation of precipitates observed inside 
the membrane can also introduce mechanical stress, which could 
be  a  major  degradation  mode  for  aromatic  membranes  used  in 
VRFBs. 

The evaluation of the oxidative stability of a membrane is com- 
monly conducted by immersing the membrane into an electrolyte 
+ /H 
solution of VO 
4 . Afterwards, the concentration variation of 
2 
the VO 2 + in the solution at regular time intervals is examined. Fol- 
lowing this, the amount of VO 2 +  obtained from the reduction of 
+ is used to analyze the oxidative stability of the membrane, 
VO 
2 
mathematically expressed as [115] :

where  c ( VO 2 + )  represents  the  ﬁnal  concentration  of  VO 2 +  after

before the test. Naﬁon membranes have been reported to reduce 
+  to VO 2 +  after 21 days, thereby showing superior 
1% of the VO 
2 
chemical  stability  [76] .  In  addition,  the  chemical  stability  of  the 
membrane can also be determined by measuring the weight of the 
+ /H 
membrane  both  before  and  after  immersing  it  into  VO 
2 SO

electrolyte solution to calculate the membrane weight loss as fol- 
lows [115] : 

Weight loss ( % ) =

(8) 

where  W 
b  and  W a  represents  the  membrane  weight  before  and 
after  the  chemical  stability  test,  respectively.  Through  these  re- 
sults,  membrane  degradation  can  therefore  be  quantiﬁed.  Other 
methods such as using the scanning electron microcopy (SEM) to 
monitor the morphological changes in membrane before and af- 
ter the chemical test can also be employed to conﬁrm the chemi- 
cal stability of membrane structure [116] . The chemical stability of 
membrane in VRFBs is not only dependent on the oxidative sta- 
bility  of  the  membrane,  but  also  relates  to  its  hydrolytic  stabil- 
ity considering the cell operating condition. Following this, mem- 
brane  degradation  caused  by  water  in  the  electrolyte  have  also 
been reported [117] . This is due to the fact that water molecule can 
break the polymer chain and then signiﬁcantly affect the mechan- 
ical strength of the membrane and even lead to the breakdown of 
the membrane structure [118] . For the hydrolytic stability test, the 
membrane is ﬁrst immersed into hot water for a period of time, 
and then the changes of the membrane properties such as mechan- 
ical properties, morphology changes, conductivity, and weight loss 
are evaluated to assess the membrane stability [117,119,120] . 

4.1.6. Thermal stability 

The thermal stability is another important criterion to be con- 
sidered when evaluating membrane performance. An increase in 
operating temperature has been severally reported as an effective 
method to enhance the performance of ﬂow batteries. For example, 
the performance of a VRFB has been reported with a peak power 
density increment from 259.5 to 349.8 mW cm −2  when the op- 
erating temperature was increased from 15 to 55 ˚C [121] . Hence, 
it is essential for a polymer electrolyte membrane to possess ex- 
cellent thermal stability which allows the battery to safely operate 
under wide operational temperature range. The thermal stability of 
membrane is commonly determined through the thermogravimet- 
ric test (TGA) [93,122] . During this test, the membrane is heated 
at rate of 10 °C min −1 under nitrogen conditions while the mem- 
brane weight loss is recorded during the heating process to evalu- 
ate its thermal stability. The TGA results with a lower weight loss 
at higher temperature indicates a better thermal stability. Gener- 
ally,  for  the  Naﬁon  series  membranes,  the  major  decomposition 
happens at temperature around 40 0-50 0 ˚C with the ﬁnal residue 
weight  lower  than  10%  [76,80] .  It  is  also  worth  to  note  that,  as 
VRFBs would normally not operate under an operating tempera- 
ture  higher  than  100 °C,  it  is  more  reasonable  to  investigate  the 
thermal stability of membrane at temperatures below 100 °C, which 
therefore underscores the importance of investigating membrane 
shrinkage under high operating temperatures [123] . 

4.1.7. Mechanical property 

The mechanical strength of a membrane not only inﬂuences its 
long-term stability, but also plays a vital role during the prepara- 
tion process as the membrane may undergo compression as well 
as stretching during fabrication. Generally, membranes with high 
mechanical  strength  have  been  reported  to  ease  the  assembling 
process of battery system and also increase the lifetime of batter- 
ies. It is worth to mention that the mechanical property of a poly- 
mer electrolyte membrane not only depend on intrinsic parameters 
such as the type of material used, but can also be affected by its 

X. Shi, O.C. Esan, X. Huo et al. 

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 85 (2021) 100926 

to the ohmic resistance of the cell components. The mass trans- 
port loss results from the consumed reactive species near the elec- 
trode surface, which is dominant at the high current density region 
where reactants are depleted [130,131] . The shape of the polariza- 
tion curve can also reveal the dominant overpotential limiting the 
cell performance. However, it should be noted that the polarization 
curve may not be able to provide suﬃcient information to identify 
the causes of these overpotentials. To perform the polarization test, 
the cell is usually charged to a state of charge (SOC) of ~50-100 
[121,132] . Then, the curve is obtained through recording and plot- 
ting the cell voltage at various current densities to reveal the rela- 
tionships between these parameters. With this, the power density 
curve can also be obtained by multiplying the cell voltage with the 
corresponding current density, from which the peak power density 
that can be delivered from the cell can be revealed. 

4.2.2. Charge-discharge performance 

Charge-discharge  test  is  also  an  important  method  that  is 
mostly  used  in  evaluating  the  performance  of  membrane  at  cell 
level. This test is conducted by charging and discharging the cell 
at a ﬁxed current, in order to examine the cell performance for 
energy storage and power generation under operation conditions 
that is very close to its real application. It is therefore considered 
as one of the most standard tests that can be used to evaluate the 
cell performance. For the charge-discharge cycle test, the discharge 
capacities and the charge-discharge proﬁles of the cell are the most 
important results for performance evaluation. While the discharge 
capacity indicates the highest amount of electric charge the cell 
can deliver, the charge-discharge proﬁle reveals the charge and dis- 
charge voltage of the cell. The ideal polymer electrolyte membrane 
in ﬂow batteries is desired to provide the cell with high and stable 
charge/discharge capacity, low charge voltage, and high discharge 
voltage. In VRFBs, the charge-discharge test is generally conducted 
using the battery testing system with a voltage range of ~0.7-1.7 
V at a constant current density between ~20-100 mA cm −2 [133–
135] . Normally, for the VRFB using the Naﬁon series membranes 
and operating at  20-100 mA  cm −2 ,  the cell  is able to achieve a 
voltage  plateau  of  ~1.1-1.35  V  during  discharging  and  a  voltage 
plateau of ~1.35-1.5 V during charging [67,136,137] . 

4.2.3. Coulombic, Voltage, and Energy eﬃciencies 

Apart from the charge-discharge proﬁle, the coulombic, voltage, 
and  energy  eﬃciencies  are  three  important  eﬃciencies  that  are 
popularly  used  in  evaluating  the  performance  of  batteries  [138] . 
The  coulombic  eﬃciency  is  a  performance  indicator  that  evalu- 
ates the ratio of the discharge capacity to the charge capacity of 
a  cell,  while  the  voltage  eﬃciency  is  an  indicator  for  evaluating 
the overpotential losses during charging and discharging process. 
Many studies have shown that high coulombic eﬃciency can be 
mainly achieved when there is low permeability of vanadium ions 
through the membrane, which further improves the capacity reten- 
tion ability of the battery [127,139] . On the other hand, high volt- 
age eﬃciency is attributed to superior ionic conductivity of mem- 
brane and low internal resistance within the cell [68,140] . Energy 
eﬃciency, which is commonly expressed as the product of coulom- 
bic eﬃciency and voltage eﬃciency, precisely indicates the overall 
performance of ﬂow battery systems. The calculation of these three 
eﬃciencies are obtained using [141] :

thickness. To evaluate the mechanical property of membrane, ten- 
sile testing machine, as shown in Fig. 2 (b), [98] is usually applied 
to  determine  the  ultimate  tensile  strength  of  the  membrane  as 
well as its elongation at break [84,109] . The test has been reported 
to be conducted with membrane under both dry and wet condi- 
tions [98,112,124,125] . It is not only important for the membrane to 
be mechanically stable under dry condition so as to prevent rup- 
ture or damage during the fabrication and assembling process of 
battery  system,  but  also  of  equal  importance  for  it  to  be  stable 
under wet condition to ensure long-term stability of the battery. 
High ultimate tensile strength and elongation at break demonstrate 
a  membrane  with  mechanical  stability.  For  instance,  the  widely 
used Naﬁon membranes have been reported to possess a tensile 
strength within the range of 14-24 MPa with an elongation of 170- 
250% under both wet and dry conditions [77,80,98,112] . This could 
serve as a benchmark for assessing the mechanical properties of 
membranes to be used in ﬂow batteries. 

4.2. Cell level 

While all the performance evaluation parameters discussed in 
Section 4.1 allow the comprehensive characterization of the prop- 
erties of polymer electrolyte membranes, it is also of vital impor- 
tance to evaluate the ultimate performance of membranes when 
used in a ﬂow battery system. Therefore, to evaluate membrane 
performance at the cell level, charge-discharge performance, long 
term  stability,  and  self-discharge  rate  are  commonly  carried  out 
[126,127] . 

4.2.1. Polarization curve 

The polarization curve is one of the methods commonly em- 
ployed  to  illustrate  the  relationship  between  voltage  output  and 
applied current density in ﬂow batteries. In other words, the curve 
can be used to investigate the response of cell voltage with change 
in current to further provide information about the system perfor- 
mance [128] . Other than this, the contribution of different polar- 
ization losses including the activation loss, ohmic loss, and mass 
transport loss can be analyzed with a polarization curve ( Fig. 3 ) 
[129] .  The  activation  loss,  dominant  at  low  current  density  re- 
gion,  is  majorly  inﬂuenced  by  the  activation  energy  required  to 
initiate the electrochemical reaction. The ohmic loss is attributed

ity of the cell, respectively. And V 
cha represent the mean 
discharge and charge voltage of the cell, respectively [69,136,142] . 

dis and V 

4.2.4. Cycle stability 

The cycle stability of a battery is also a key indicator for eval- 
uating the performance of a membrane. During the operation of 
VRFBs,  the  inevitable  crossover  phenomenon  of  vanadium  ions 
would  result  in  imbalanced  volume  and  concentration  of  elec- 
trolytes between the two sides of the battery  system [67] . Such 
a phenomenon often results into capacity loss, consequently dete- 
riorating the cycling stability of the battery, which however can be 
restored by remixing the electrolytes at both sides [67] . In compar- 
ison to this, there are also some irreversible capacity loss during 
long-term operation of the battery, such as the possible side re- 
actions between electrolytes and cell components, and electrolyte 
leakage  which  could  lead  to  irreversible  loss  of  reactive  species 
[143] . Even though the cycle stability is not solely dependent on 
the membrane performance, membrane still plays vital roles in de- 
termining the cycle stability of the cell. Generally, the cycle stabil- 
ity of cell is determined by using the same battery testing system 
as  the  charge-discharge  tests,  while  mainly  focusing  on  evaluat- 
ing the stability of the cell performance after long-term operation 
[83,85] . The test is conducted by charging and discharging the cell 
at a ﬁxed current density for many cycles to examine its capacity 
retention ability, which is calculated through dividing the discharge 
capacity of the cell at the last tested cycle by the value at the ﬁrst 
tested cycle. The test results with more cycles and better capac- 
ity retention ability indicate a better cycle stability and prove the 
long-term operation capability of both the membrane and battery 
[67,68,98] . 

4.2.5. Rate performance 

The rate performance test is employed in evaluating the charge- 
discharge performance of cell under various current densities, es- 
pecially under high current densities, which is of paramount im- 
portance during practical applications. It is signiﬁcant for achiev- 
ing reduced system size and capital costs, as the cell needs to be 
operated at high current density and generate high power and ef- 
ﬁciencies, which however are often limited by the large polariza- 
tion loss with increasing of current density [144] . This polarization 
loss, in more detail, is closely related to the membrane conductiv- 
ity, which thereby places high ionic conductivity of membrane as 
a major requirement so as to reduce ohmic loss and increase the 
eﬃciencies of the battery system under high current density oper- 
ation. In addition, it also indicates the battery can provide high ef- 
ﬁciencies at a wide range of current densities [145] , which thereby 
allows the battery to be applied under various working conditions. 
During the test, results including the discharge capacity, coulom- 
bic eﬃciency, voltage eﬃciency, and energy eﬃciency are recorded. 
High discharge capacity and eﬃciencies under high current den- 
sity indicates a better rate performance of the membrane and cell 
[67,146,147] . 

4.2.6. Self-discharge 

During the actual operation of a ﬂow battery, the active species 
may  inevitably  transport  through  the  membrane,  which  is  also 
known as the vanadium-ion crossover phenomenon. Such process 
leads to  imbalance of  electrolyte  volume and concentration,  and 
further  result  to  capacity  loss,  which  is  also  known  as  the  self- 
discharge. In the characterization section at membrane level, the 
transport ability of vanadium ions through the membrane can be 
evaluated  through  the  vanadium-ion  permeability  test.  However, 
such testing environment is still slightly different from the actual 
conditions during charge-discharge processes of ﬂow battery sys- 
tems.  Therefore,  to  determine  the  actual  inﬂuence  of  vanadium

brane; (c) amphoteric-ion exchange membrane; and (d) porous membrane. 

ions transport across the membrane at cell-level, the self-discharge 
test is needed. 

For  VRFBs,  the  self-discharge  test  of  the  cell  is  mostly  con- 
ducted by ﬁrst charging the cell to SOC-50 148, 149 and then using 
the battery testing system to record the change in battery voltage 
while  maintaining  the  circulating  electrolyte.  The  self-discharge 
test ends when the open-circuit voltage of cell drops below 0.8 V. 
A long test duration indicates that the cell has low self-discharge 
rate [80,125,137] . 

5. Membrane classiﬁcations and preparations 

As mentioned earlier, membrane is an indispensable component 
in RFBs not only to serve as medium for the transport of charge 
carriers but also to avoid the crossover of reactive species between 
two half-cells. Hence, various types of membrane have been de- 
veloped and studied for the purpose of application in RFBs. These 
membranes, according to the functional groups attached and their 
major  purpose,  can  be  mainly  categorized  into  cation-exchange 
membranes, anion-exchange membranes, amphoteric-ion exchange 
membranes, and porous membranes. 

5.1. Cation-exchange membranes 

The cation-exchange membrane is the most well-developed and 
widely used in RFBs. In the pores of cation-exchange membranes, 
anionic functional groups are intrinsically attached on the polymer 
backbone to facilitate the transport cations as shown in Fig. 4 (a). 
Based on the presence of anionic functional group, Naﬁon-based 
membranes and many other polymeric membranes are the com- 
mon  cation-exchange  membranes  commonly  employed  in  RFBs. 
The latest development on these membranes are summarized and 
discussed in this section. 

5.1.1. Pure Naﬁon membranes 

The  pure  Naﬁon  membranes,  also  known  as  Dupont’s  Naﬁon 
membranes,  are  the  most  widely  applied  commercial  cation- 
exchange membranes in ﬂow batteries due to their excellent ionic 

8 

X. Shi, O.C. Esan, X. Huo et al. 

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 85 (2021) 100926 

conductivity  and  chemical  stability.  The  attractive  properties  of 
pure Naﬁon membranes are established by their distinctive struc- 
tures, where perﬂuorovinyl ether groups terminated with sulfonate 
groups are incorporated onto a stable tetraﬂuoroethylene (Teﬂon) 
backbone [54] . Over the years, different types of Naﬁon membrane 
have been produced by Dupont [67,150] . These membranes have 
varied  thicknesses  and  present  different  performances  when  as- 
sembled into ﬂow batteries. This is due to the fact that membrane 
thickness plays a key role on inﬂuencing the membrane properties 
such as area resistance and vanadium-ion crossover rate. Hence, to 
examine the inﬂuence of membrane thickness on the performance 
of a RFB, different types of Naﬁon membrane including Naﬁon 112, 
Naﬁon 1135, Naﬁon 115, and Naﬁon 117 have been used in VRFBs 
for performance comparison [67] . The obtained properties and per- 
formances of these membranes are summarized in Table S1 . It was 
found that self-discharge rate, discharge capacity fading rate, and 
electrolyte volume change rate all reduce with increase in mem- 
brane thickness. In contrast, thin membranes presented low area 
resistance and are thus considered to be more suitable for batter- 
ies operating under high current densities. Overall, results from the 
experimental study show that Naﬁon 115 membrane possesses the 
highest performance, among the four types of Naﬁon membranes 
investigated, due to its superior balance between membrane resis- 
tance and vanadium-ion crossover rate rendering it as the mem- 
brane option most suitable for application in VRFBs. 

5.1.2. Modiﬁed Naﬁon membranes 
5.1.2.1. Combining with other polymers.  The utilization and perfor- 
mance of Naﬁon series membranes in ﬂow batteries has been sev- 
erally studied, however, the high capital cost of these membranes 
greatly restricts their wide applications. Therefore, a lot of research 
efforts have been made to reduce the amount of Naﬁon used dur- 
ing membrane preparation while maintaining their excellent per- 
formance. 

Casting a thin layer of Naﬁon onto the surface of a polymer sub- 
strate has been considered as an effective modiﬁcation method as 
it not only improves the membrane performance, but also reduces 
the cost of the membrane production due to the reduction in the 
amount of Naﬁon used in the process. This method is conducted 
by pouring or spraying Naﬁon solution onto the surface of a poly- 
mer  substrate  [151] .  The  ﬁnal  composite  membrane  is  obtained 
after  the  evaporation  of  the  solvents.  The  membranes  prepared 
by  this  method  are  reported  to  possess  uniform  thickness,  ﬂat- 
ness, and dimensional stability [59] . However, due to the relatively 
weak interaction between the casting layer and the substrate layer, 
the  casting  layer  is  reported  to  easily  dissociate  from  the  sub- 
strate layer, particularly after long-term operation, which therefore 
adversely affect the chemical stability of the membrane [59,152] . 
Many  studies  have  been  conducted  based  on  this  idea  while 
various  materials  including  sulfonated  poly(ether  ether  ketone) 
(SPEEK)  [140] ,  poly(ether  sulfone)  (PES)  [111] ,  polybenzimidazole 
(PBI) [151] , and polytetraﬂuoroethylene (PTFE) [112,149] have been 
cast with a thin layer of Naﬁon to improve both membrane and 
battery  performances,  many  of  which  are  summarized  in  Table 
S2 [108,110,111,151] . Among these reported membranes, one suc- 
cessful  attempt  that  achieved  low  vanadium  ions  permeability 
was demonstrated by a PBI-based membrane coated with Naﬁon 
[151] .  The  PBI  layer  reduces  vanadium  ions  permeability  of  the 
membrane,  while  the  Naﬁon  enhances  the  chemical  stability  of 
the  membrane.  It  was  found  that  this  composite  membrane  ﬁ- 
nally exhibits an apparently reduced vanadium-ion permeability of 
1.95 × 10 −9  cm 2  min −1  ( Fig. 5 (a)) and an improved energy eﬃ- 
ciency of 76.84% at 100 mA cm −2 compared to Naﬁon 115. Another 
commercial membrane named VANADion was also developed with 
this strategy. The VANADion membrane is composed of a thin layer 
of Naﬁon and a porous substrate layer, as shown in Fig. 5 (b), which 

contribute  to  the  price  reduction  of  the  membrane.  It  has  been 
studied by Zhou et al. [108] for its application in VRFBs. The mem- 
brane was reported to exhibit a higher energy eﬃciency of 76.2% 
and electrolyte utilization eﬃciency of 68.4% at 240 mA cm −2 com- 
pared to the Naﬁon 115 with an energy eﬃciency of 71.3% and an 
electrolyte utilization of 54.1% under the same condition. Such per- 
formance  therefore  place  VANADion  membrane  in  advantageous 
position  for  more  applications  in  ﬂow  battery  systems.  Immers- 
ing a membrane into a Naﬁon solution is another method widely 
used for introducing a thin layer of Naﬁon onto a membrane. For 
instance, Tian et al. [153] fabricated a Daramic/Naﬁon composite 
membrane by soaking a microporous Daramic membrane in a 5 
wt.% Naﬁon solution. The introduced Naﬁon partially blocked the 
pores of the membrane leading to a reduced vanadium ions per- 
meability, which in turn reduced the self-discharge rate and fur- 
ther achieved a longer self-discharge duration of over 1600 mins 
than the Daramic membrane with ~800 mins. With these results, 
introducing a thin layer of Naﬁon on the surface of a porous sub- 
strate  has  been  proven  to  be  an  effective  method  for  modifying 
Naﬁon membranes. 

Other than the modiﬁcation methods mentioned above, blend- 
ing  the  Naﬁon  resin  with  other  polymers  for  membrane  prepa- 
ration is another effective method through which Naﬁon can be 
tightly  combined  with  other  polymers.  Materials  including  PVDF 
[125] ,  PTFE  [76] ,  and  others  [154]  have  been  directly  blended 
with Naﬁon to prepare composite membranes and they have all 
achieved improved performances. 

One  of  the  successful  attempts  which  achieved  an  improved 
membrane performance was demonstrated by blending the highly 
crystalline and hydrophobic PVDF polymer with Naﬁon to fabricate 
PVDF/Naﬁon composite membrane. The modiﬁcation process was 
not only found to successfully restrain the swelling behavior of the 
membrane but also improves the ions selectivity of the membrane 
[125] . In comparison to the recast-Naﬁon membrane, this compos- 
ite membrane achieved higher coulombic eﬃciency of ~93-95% at 
40-80 mA cm −2 ( Fig. 6 (a)). With the same strategy, another study 
utilizing hydrophobic PTFE has also been conducted and a series 
of Naﬁon/PTFE blend membranes with various weight ratios were 
prepared [76] . The obtained composite membrane showed an im- 
proved chemical stability with stable cycle performance for over 50 
cycles. Thus, the usage of hydrophobic polymers for Naﬁon modi- 
ﬁcation was demonstrated as a promising method to prevent the 
crossover of vanadium ions through the membrane and also pro- 
vide the membrane with better chemical stability. However, this 
approach may also reduce the ionic conductivity of the membrane 
due to the hydrophobic nature of the polymer introduced and fur- 
ther leads to a lower voltage eﬃciency. 

Another strategy for combining Naﬁon with different polymers 
is to immerse the Naﬁon membrane into other polymers in order 
to  obtain the  Naﬁon-based composite  membrane. Polymers  such 
as (poly)pyrrole [154,155] have been used to obtain Naﬁon-based 
composite membranes through this strategy, which was also found 
to  successfully  improve  membrane  properties  and  in  turn  pro- 
vides the battery with improved performance. Elsewhere, Xi et al. 
[102]  have  used  polycation  poly(diallyldimethylammonium  chlo- 
ride) (PDDA) and polyanion poly(sodium styrene sulfonate) (PSS) to 
prepare a multilayer barrier on the surface of Naﬁon membrane via 
the layer-by-layer self-assembly technique, as shown in Fig. 6 (b). 
This powerful layer-by-layer technique is based on the adsorption 
of oppositely charged species onto the membrane alternately using 
the electrostatic attraction, which can freely control the composi- 
tion and property of the membrane. In addition to this, it is en- 
vironmentally friendly and with cost-effectiveness [156] . With the 
introduction  of  these  barrier  layers  onto  the  membrane  surface, 
improved  coulombic  eﬃciency  of  97.6%  and  energy  eﬃciency  of 
83.9% compared to the pristine Naﬁon membrane were obtained.

Such  a  performance  improvement is  considered  to  be  attributed 
to the covering of ion-transport pathways and the electrostatic re- 
pulsion  effect,  which  further  restrict  vanadium-ion  permeability 
of the membrane. The improved membrane performance achieved 
through this strategy, most of which are also summarized in Table 
S2 [76,125,154,157] , have proven that combining Naﬁon with other 
polymers is an effective solution to achieve a membrane with bet- 
ter cost-effectiveness and improved battery performance compared 
to pristine Naﬁon. 

5.1.2.2. Combining  with  organic/inorganic  materials.  The  high 
vanadium-ion  permeability  of  Naﬁon  membranes  is  one  of  the 
major  factors  hindering  their  wide  application.  Thus,  much  ef- 
forts  have  been  invested  to  reduce  vanadium-ion  permeability 
of  the  Naﬁon  membranes  through  blending  them  with  various 
organic  and  inorganic  materials.  This  idea  was  ﬁrst  inspired 
by  the  promising  results  obtained  from  direct  methanol  fuel 
cell,  where  inorganic  materials  have  been  proven  to  eﬃciently 
decrease methanol permeability through membrane, as the inor- 
ganic  materials  can  block  the  hydrophilic  regions  of  membranes 
[54] .  Guided  by  this  idea,  silicalite  [158] ,  amino-silica  [68] ,

carbon, [80] N,N-dimethylaminoethylmethacrylate, [75] and other 
materials  [77,91,142,164–169]  are  some  of  the  organic/inorganic 
materials that have been integrated with Naﬁon to prepare com- 
posite membranes for use in VRFBs. A look at the performance and 
properties of some of these Naﬁon membranes recently modiﬁed 
through  combining  with  organic/inorganic  materials  are  sum- 
marized  in  Table  S3  [98,100,137,163,164,167–170] .  Some  of  these 
studies  where  signiﬁcant  improvement  in  battery  performance 
was achieved are discussed in detail below. 

One  of  the  techniques  that  have  been  employed  in  introduc- 
ing organic/inorganic materials into the Naﬁon membranes is the 
layer-by-layer  self-assembly  technique,  as  discussed  above  [137] . 
Lu et al. [79] applied this technique and obtained a novel Naﬁon- 
based polymer-inorganic composite membrane. The polycation chi- 
tosan  (CS)  and  negatively  charged  phosphotungstic  acid  (PWA) 
were  introduced  onto  the  surface  of  Naﬁon  membrane  layer-by- 
layer.  The  introduction  of  CS-PWA  multilayers  greatly  reduced 
vanadium-ion permeability of the membrane while showing a neg- 
ligible impact on its proton conductivity. It is considered that the 
vanadium  ion  permeability  of  this  membrane  is  mainly  reduced 
by the multi-layered structure, while the proton conducting PWA 

10

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 85 (2021) 100926 

helps to retain the ionic conductivity of the membrane. The bat- 
tery using this membrane exhibits high coulombic (~80%) and en- 
ergy  eﬃciencies  (~75%)  and  long  self-discharge  duration  of  ~70 
hours compared to a battery using the pristine Naﬁon membrane, 
which  only  possesses  a  coulombic  eﬃciency  of  ~77%,  an  energy 
eﬃciency of ~71% and a self-discharge duration of ~50 hours. In 
addition  to  the  fabrication  method,  the  material  used  also  plays 
a key role in determining the membrane performance. It is sug- 
gested that after the modiﬁcation, the top-layer of the multilayered 
membrane should exhibit excellent chemical stability and ion con- 
ductivity, so as to ensure long-term battery stability and effective 
ion transport. In the meanwhile, the number of layers and thick- 
ness of each layer should also be carefully adjusted so as to ensure 
proper thickness to achieve lower membrane resistance and vana- 
dium crossover rate at the same time [54] . 

GO is a material that has attracted a lot of attention worldwide 
due to its special two-dimensional layered structure. It has been 
introduced into Naﬁon to fabricate a series of GO/Naﬁon compos- 
ite membranes with various GO contents [162] . It was found that, 
after the introduction of GO, the proton conductivity and vanadium 
ions  permeability  of  the  composite  membrane  decreased,  which 
are attributed to the reduced value of inter-planar space dimen- 
sion. In order to further maximize the vanadium ions barrier ef- 
fect of GO, Su et al. [98] therefore designed and prepared an ultra- 
thin  Naﬁon/GO  composite  layer  on  the  surface  of  Naﬁon  mem- 
brane using the spin coating method with GO nanosheets in par- 
allel  to  the  surface  of  membrane,  as  shown  in  Fig.  6  (c) .  Com- 
pared to Naﬁon 212, this GO/Naﬁon composite membrane exhib- 
ited a reduced vanadium-ion permeability and the batteries using 
it has been reported to achieve an improved coulombic eﬃciency 
of 92.9-98.8% at 20-100 mA cm −2 . The membrane also showed an 
improved balance between vanadium ions permeability and proton 
conductivity which resulted in an 88.5% capacity retention ability 
after 50 cycles. 

Other  than  the  GO,  catalysts  have  also  been  introduced  into 
Naﬁon  membrane  for  modiﬁcation.  The  electrocatalyst  tungsten 
trioxide/super  activated  carbon  was  sprayed  onto  the  surface  of 
Naﬁon  membrane  to  obtain  a  catalyst  coated  membrane  (CCM) 
[136] . It was found that, the introduction of this catalyst layer on 
the membrane surface reduces the reaction over-potential due to 
the excellent electrochemical reactivity of the catalyst, which fur- 
ther  results  in  a  voltage  eﬃciency  of  85.9%  and  an  energy  eﬃ- 
ciency of 81.2% at 120 mA cm −2  while the battery with pristine 
Naﬁon membrane only presented a voltage eﬃciency of 81.3% and 
an energy eﬃciency of 76.9%. Apart from the improved eﬃciencies 
offered by the CCM, the membrane also showed an excellent sta- 
bility with no obvious drop in energy eﬃciency for 300 cycles. 

Utilizing the methods and materials discussed in this section, 
the modiﬁed Naﬁon-based membranes facilitated the performance 
improvement of batteries, even at low cost. However, the real ap- 
plication of all these modiﬁed Naﬁon-based membranes is still be- 
ing held back as their performances are yet to satisfactorily meet 
the requirements for actual application. One of the major limita- 
tions  is  the  poor  capacity  retention  ability  of  these  membranes 
after a long-term operation. Therefore, these Naﬁon-based mem- 
branes  still  require  further  studies  before their  real  applications. 
More intensiﬁed effort s on eﬃcient modiﬁcations of Naﬁon mem- 
branes are also needed. 

5.1.3. Other polymeric cation-exchange membranes 

Although the Naﬁon membranes can provide an acceptable bat- 
tery  performance  for  ﬂow  batteries,  their  high  cost  has  greatly 
restricted  the  large-scale  application  of  ﬂow  batteries.  There- 
fore,  many  efforts  have  been  devoted  into  the  preparation  of 
new  polymeric  cation-exchange  membranes  that  could  compete 
with or replace the Naﬁon membranes. Materials including SPEEK 

[70,85,94,124,148,171–205] ,  sulfonated  polyimide  (SPI)  [107,206–
222] sulfonated poly (ﬂuorenyl ether ketone) (SPFEK) [71,223–227] , 
PTFE [84,228–231] , PES [232–234] , PVDF [103,235,236] , sulfonated 
poly(phthalazinone ether ketone) (SPPEK), [141,237,238] and many 
others have been used for membrane preparation and their perfor- 
mance have been examined. Many of these materials are discussed 
in the following sections together with their performance and lim- 
itations. 

5.1.3.1. Sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) (SPEEK)-based.  SPEEK, as 
a  sulfonated  aromatic  polymer,  has  drawn  a  lot  of  attention  for 
membrane preparation in VRFBs due to its low cost, ease of prepa- 
ration  and  superior  chemical  and  thermal  stabilities  [124] .  Un- 
like the structure of Naﬁon, SPEEK has a less hydrophobic back- 
bone  and  less  acidic  sulfonic  acid  group  and  therefore  leads  to 
a  weaker  separation  between  hydrophobic  and  hydrophilic  re- 
gion. Such a different microstructure hence results in a narrower 
ion  channels  and  has  been  proven  to  exhibit  a  lower  methanol 
crossover rate when applied in direct methanol fuel cells, in com- 
parison to Naﬁon series [52] . Therefore, the SPEEK is regarded as 
a promising candidate for cation-exchange membrane fabrication 
and have been extensively applied and studied in VRFBs. The prop- 
erties  of  SPEEK  are  highly  dependent  on  the  degree  of  sulfona- 
tion  (DS)  [200,202,205] .  The  SPEEK-based  membranes  with  high 
DS always possess a better ion-conductivity and IEC, although they 
also  show  high  vanadium-ion  permeability  and  poor  mechanical 
stability which limits their real applications [171] . To gain a bet- 
ter  performance  and  render  the  SPEEK  feasible  for  real  applica- 
tion,  a  lot  of  modiﬁcation  methods  have  been  carried  out.  The 
major modiﬁcation methods including the combination of SPEEK 
with other polymers [85,94,171–174] , and the addition of additives 
[124,148,175–178,196–199] have been successfully reported to im- 
prove the performance of SPEEK-based membranes. 

As  discussed  above,  one  of  the  major  factors  hampering  the 
real application of the SPEEK-based membrane with high DS is its 
poor mechanical strength. Therefore, in order to improve the me- 
chanical  properties  of  SPEEK-based  membranes,  the  hydrophobic 
PVDF polymer, which has superior mechanical strength, has been 
introduced  into  SPEEK  to  prepare  a  series  of  SPEEK/PVDF  blend 
membranes with various mixing mass ratios [94] . The results in- 
dicated that, the mass ratio of the PVDF in the blend membrane 
would inﬂuence its water uptake, swelling behavior, IEC, and pro- 
ton  conductivity,  which  ﬁnally  resulted  in  a  satisfactory  balance 
between proton conductivity and vanadium-ion permeability and 
also achieved stable cycle performance for 80 cycles. Beyond en- 
hancing the mechanical properties, a thin layer of polydopamine 
(PDA) has been coated on the SPEEK membrane and was found to 
improve both the chemical stability and thermal stability of pris- 
tine SPEEK membrane [172] . It further reveals that, the coated PDA 
layer can as well effectively function as a block layer to drastically 
reduce the vanadium-ion permeability of the membrane. 

Other than combining with other polymers, addition of addi- 
tives has also been studied and proven to be an effective method. 
GO  is  a  well-studied  material  [199] .  Kong  et  al.  used  the  p- 
phenylene  diamine-functionalized  graphene  oxide  (PPD-GO)  and 
combined it with SPEEK for membrane preparation [178] . It was 
pointed out that, the interfacial interaction between -NH 
2 groups 
from PPD-GO and -SO 
3 H groups from SPEEK positively inﬂuenced 
the  water  uptake  ratio  and  swelling  behavior  of  the  composite 
membrane  to  ultimately  achieve  higher  coulombic  eﬃciency  of 
96.9% and an energy eﬃciency of 82.8% at 30 mA cm −2 compared 
to Naﬁon 117 as shown in Fig. 7 (a). In the meanwhile, long self- 
discharge duration of 56 hours and stable performance up to 100 
cycles were also achieved. In an attempt to achieve an improved 
balance between vanadium ions permeability and proton conduc- 
tivity,  ethylenediamine  functionalized  GO  was  later  synthesized

and introduced into the SPEEK matrix to fabricate a membrane for 
VRFBs [148] . It was found that the introduced N-based functional- 
ized graphene oxide (GO-NH 
2 ) successfully restrained the perme- 
ability of vanadium ions due to its layered structures and the Don- 
nan exclusion effect. The membrane also shows high ionic conduc- 
tivity with the narrow pathway provided for proton transport due 
to the electrostatic interaction between -SO 
3 H groups and N-base 
groups on the GO nanosheets. With this composite membrane, an 
improved battery performance with an energy eﬃciency of 89.5% 
at 50 mA cm −2 and capacity retention of 92% after 100 cycles was 
achieved  ( Fig.  7 (b)).  It  is  thus  apparent  that  the  introduction  of 
functionalized nanoﬁllers into other polymers is an effective mod- 
iﬁcation method suitable for enhancing their interfacial interaction 
and  further  leads  to  an  improved  battery  performance.  In  sum- 
mary,  the  SPEEK-based  membranes  have  been  modiﬁed  by  vari- 
ous methods and materials to provide them with improved per- 
formance,  with  most  of  the  recent  results  summarized  in  Table 
S4 [70,148,174–196] . However, more application of the SPEEK-based 
membrane is still being hindered as a result of its poor cyclic sta- 
bility and limited energy eﬃciency especially under high operating 
current densities. 

5.1.3.2. Sulfonated  polyimide  (SPI)-based.  Sulfonated  polyimide 
(SPI),  as  a  kind  of  non-ﬂuorinated  aromatic  polymer,  possesses 
good chemical and mechanical properties at low cost. It has been 
widely investigated for cation-exchange membrane fabrication and 
has been applied in VRFBs with most of the performance achieved 
summarized in Table S5 [211–220] . 

Among these developed SPI-based membranes, one of the suc- 
cessful attempts to effectively block the permeation of vanadium 
ions was demonstrated by the SPI/chitosan (CS) composite mem- 
branes, which was prepared using an immersion and self-assembly 
method [107] . Due to the crosslinking of CS and sulfuric acid dur- 
ing membrane preparation and the blocked micropores by CS layer, 
the crossover of vanadium ions through the membrane was signif- 
icantly restrained. The same research group further conducted an- 
other experiment to investigate the effect of inﬁltration time with 
CS solution and thereafter prepared a series of SPI/CS composite 
membranes  with  different  inﬁltration  time  [222] .  A  longer  inﬁl- 
tration time during membrane preparation would attach more CS 
molecules onto SPI, which has been proven to signiﬁcantly inﬂu- 
ence the proton conductivity, vanadium ions permeability, and me- 
chanical and chemical stabilities of the membrane. Through adjust- 
ing the inﬁltration time, the membrane with the optimum modiﬁ- 
cation time presented a balance between proton conductivity and 
vanadium ions permeability to successfully achieve a coulombic ef- 
ﬁciency of 97.8% and an energy eﬃciency of 88.6% at 40 mA cm −2 , 
demonstrating the modiﬁcation time to be an important factor to- 
wards determining the membrane performance. 

In addition, additives including ZrO 

2  [90] ,  and  sulfonated  molybdenum  disulﬁde  (s-MoS 

2  [206] , boehmite (AlOOH) 
[207] ,  TiO 
2 ) 
[239] have also been added into the SPI to prepare various com- 
posite membranes to yield improved performances. For instance, 
2  was found to exhibit a blocking effect on vanadium ions 
s-MoS 
[239] .  This  composite  SPI/s-MoS 
2  membrane,  was  also  found  to 
have  an  improved  ionic  conductivity  due  to  the  unique  two- 
dimensional  structure  and  the  sulfonated  groups  of  s-MoS 
2 .  In 
comparison to the VRFBs assembled with Naﬁon 117, the battery 
2 presented a much lower self-discharge 
assembled with SPI/s-MoS 
rate  with  a  self-discharge  duration  of  193  hours.  In  an  attempt 
to enhance the antioxidant ability of SPI-based membranes, TiO 
2 , 
a mesoporous material has been studied for membrane prepara- 
tion [90] . After the introduction of TiO 
2 , the composite membrane 
was found to also achieved an improved ionic conductivity, how- 
ever with high vanadium-ion permeability. Nonetheless, compared 
to Naﬁon 117, this composite membrane still achieved a higher en- 
ergy eﬃciency of 83.2-67.61% at 20-80 mA cm −2 with a stable per- 
formance for 50 cycles, due to its improved chemical stability. In 
summary, although the modiﬁed SPI-based membranes showed an 
improvement on battery performance compared to the pristine SPI 
membrane, their proton conductivity and cycle stability still need 
to be further improved so as to hasten their real application. 

5.1.3.3. Sulfonated poly (ﬂuorenyl ether ketone) (SPFEK)-based.  Sul- 
fonated  poly  (ﬂuorenyl  ether  ketone)  (SPFEK),  due  to  its  low- 
cost and low vanadium ions permeability, is considered as a suit- 
able substitute material for Naﬁon membranes. The pristine SPFEK 
membrane prepared through  casting  method  was  studied  for  its 
application  in  VRFBs  [227] ,  which  was  found  to  present  a  low 
vanadium ions  permeability  and  self-discharge rate  compared  to 
Naﬁon  117.  However,  the  energy  eﬃciency  of  the  VRFBs  using 
SPFEK membrane is only ~50% which is too low for real applica- 
tion. Therefore, the SPFEK has been extensively studied and mod- 
iﬁed for cation-exchange membrane preparation to ensure better 
ionic conductivity and mechanical strength during its applications. 
The performance and properties of recently prepared SPFEK-based 
membranes are summarized in Table S6 [71,223–226] . 

To  enhance  the  proton  conductivity  of  SPFEK-based  mem- 
brane,  Chen  et  al.  [224]  blended  ﬂuorinated  SPFEK  with  the  3- 
aminopropyltriethoxylsilane to prepare a F-SPFEK-APTES compos- 
ite  membrane.  It  was  found  that  the  ﬂuorinated  SPFEK  success- 
fully improved the membrane proton conductivity in comparison 
to the pristine SPFEK membrane. Moreover, after the introduction 
of 3-aminopropyltriethoxylsilane, the vanadium ions permeability 
of the composite membrane was reduced in comparison to the F- 
SPFEK  membrane  due  to  the  Donnan  effects  between  vanadium 
ions and the cationic groups of APTES. Overall, the cell using the 
F-SPFEK-APTES  composite  membrane  ﬁnally  achieved  a  coulom- 

12

bic eﬃciency of 80.4% at 50 mA cm −2 . To block the crossover of 
vanadium ions more effectively, the layer-by-layer deposition tech- 
nique as discussed in Section 5.1.2.1 was then applied for modi- 
ﬁcation  by  depositing the  PDDA  and  PSS  onto  this  SPFEK  mem- 
brane repeteadly [226] . It was found that, utilizing this technique, 
the modiﬁed membrane successfully demonstrated a coulombic ef- 
ﬁciency  of  82.1%  at  30  mA  cm −2 .  However,  it  is  worth  to  men- 
tion that, even though the SPFEK-based membranes have indeed 
shown an improved battery performance after these modiﬁcations, 
they are still far from the real applications primarily due to their 
poor balance between proton conductivity and vanadium-ions per- 
meability. Hence, it is important for the properties of SPFEK-based 
membranes to be carefully adjusted before they can truly achieve 
a superior battery performance. 

5.1.3.4. Polytetraﬂuoroethylene 
(PTFE)-based.  Polytetraﬂuoroethy- 
lene (PTFE), as a polymer with superior chemical and mechanical 
stability, was widely used for membrane preparation in fuel cells 
at ﬁrst [84] . Attracted by its great performance in fuel cells, more 
and more studies have begun to apply the PTFE-based membranes 
in  ﬂow  batteries,  whose  performances  are  summarized  in  Table 
S7  [84,228–231] .  One  widely  studied  modiﬁcation  of  PTFE  is  to 
produce a composite membrane of PTFE and SPEEK [84,228,229] , 
and  among  them,  a  study  was  conducted  to  analyze  the  effects 
of  solvents  on  the  membrane  performance  through  preparing 
a  series  of  SPEEK/PTFE  composite  membranes  utilizing  three 
different solvents [229] . The SPEEK was dissolved into N-methyl- 
2-pyrrolidone  (NMP),  N,N’-dimethylacetamide  (DMAc),  and  DMF 
separately and then cast onto the PTFE-base membranes to obtain 
the ﬁnal composite membranes. It was found that the membrane 
prepared  with  NMP  achieved  high  proton  conductivity  due  to 
the  ease  of  NMP  removal,  while  the  membrane  prepared  with 
DMF showed low vanadium-ion permeability and the membrane 
that  used  DMAc  presented  the  best  mechanical  strength.  Hence, 
it  is  revealed  that  the  solvents  had  a  great  inﬂuence  on  the 
membranes’  physicochemical  properties  which  can  further  affect 
the  battery  performance.  Overall,  the  VRFBs  assembled  with  the 
SPEEK/DMF/PTFE membranes presented the best performance with 
an  energy  eﬃciency  of  91.2%  at  40  mA  cm −2 .  However,  while 
these  SPEEK  modiﬁed  PTEF-based  membranes  have  shown  im- 
proved battery performance, the studies regarding the PTFE-based 
membranes  are  still  limited.  The  incorporation  of  more  suitable 
materials can therefore be a potential direction for future studies. 

5.1.3.5. Poly(ether  sulfone)  (PES)-based.  Poly(ether  sulfone)  (PES), 
with its excellent mechanical stability, has been widely used for 
membrane  fabrication  and  applied  in  separation  process  like  ul- 
traﬁltration  and  nanoﬁltration  [240,241] .  It  has  also  been  used 
in the preparation of cation-exchange membranes and employed 
in VRFBs with its achieved performance summarized in Table S8 
[232–234] . 

For instance, sulfonated poly(ether sulfone) (SPES) and SPEEK 
have been employed for membrane fabrication in a previous study 
[233] .  The  obtained  membrane  was  reported  to  eventually  ex- 
hibit improved mechanical stability and high water uptake ratio. 
Compared to the battery with Naﬁon 212, the battery using this 
SPES/SPEEK membrane achieved a higher coulombic eﬃciency of 
98% and energy eﬃciency of 85% at 50 mA cm −2 . However, similar 
to other aromatic polymer-based ion-exchange membranes, one of 
the major problems of PES is its poor chemical stability. Therefore, 
to improve the membrane stability, a strategy to isolate the ion- 
exchange groups from polymer backbone has been demonstrated 
[232] . After the detachment, the ion-exchange group was then re- 
constructed by ﬁxing the phosphotungstic acid (TPA) into alkaline 
poly(vinyl  pyrrolidone)  (PVP)  and  the  VRFB  assembled  with  this 

membrane presented a coulombic eﬃciency of 99.36% and an en- 
ergy eﬃciency of 81.61% at 140 mA cm −2  which are higher than 
those of Naﬁon 115, as shown in Fig. 8 (a). In the meanwhile, the 
membrane also exhibited a superior chemical stability and showed 
a stable cycle performance for over 1200 cycles. However, while 
some of these PES-based membranes have indeed shown great po- 
tential for further applications, it is still necessary for them to at- 
tain improved conductivity while maintaining their low vanadium- 
ions permeability for high energy eﬃciency at high operating cur- 
rent density. 

5.1.3.6. Poly(vinylidene ﬂuoride) (PVDF)-based.  Poly(vinylidene ﬂuo- 
ride)  (PVDF),  a  hydrophobic  polymer,  has  drawn  a  lot  of  atten- 
tions  and  been  widely  used  for  membrane  fabrication  in  recent 
years. It possesses excellent mechanical, thermal and chemical sta- 
bilities which ensure long-term stabilities for membranes and bat- 
teries.  However,  the  hydrophobic  nature  of  PVDF  limits  its  ionic 
conductivity  when  employed  in  VRFBs  due  to  the  presence  of 
aqueous electrolyte. To enhance the performance of a PVDF-based 
membrane, various materials have been grafted onto it to prepare 
the cation-exchange membrane. This technique, utilizing radiation 
sources such as electron-beam and γ -rays, allows ionic chemical 
groups or free radicals to be induced onto the polymer, to achieve 
the combination of properties and advantages of the various ma- 
terials [59] . The performances and properties of PVDF-based mem- 
branes recently employed in VRFBs are summarized in Table S9 
[103,235,236] , while some of the prominent studies are discussed 
below. 

One  of  the  examples  of  utilizing  the  grafting  technique  for 
PVDF-based  membrane  performance  improvement  is  carried  out 
through  the  electron-beam-induced  pre-irradiation  grafting  tech- 
nique, which successfully grafted the styrene (St) and maleic an- 
hydride (MAn) onto the commercially obtained PVDF [235] . Dur- 
ing the experiment, it was found that the required dose during the 
membrane preparation can be reduced effectively through adding 
the MAn during the preparation process. Compared to Naﬁon 117, 
the obtained membrane possessed higher IEC and ionic conductiv- 
ity with a much lower vanadium-ion permeability. However, the 
performance  study  of  this  membrane  on  battery-level  is  insuﬃ- 
cient as no charge-discharge tests were reported. In comparison to 
this, in another study conducted by Luo et al. [103] more cell-level 
tests  were  reported.  They  prepared  a  poly(vinylidene  ﬂuoride)- 
graft-poly(styrene  sulfonic  acid)  (PVDF-g-PSSA)  membrane  utiliz- 
ing a solution grafting method. It was found that, this PVDF-based 
membrane exhibits low vanadium-ion permeability and adequate 
chemical stability, to achieve an excellent capacity retention abil- 
ity with no obvious capacity drop for about 250 cycles as shown 
in  Fig.  8 (b).  Moreover,  the  battery  using  PVDF-g-PSSA  presented 
higher coulombic eﬃciency of ~75-90% at 10-60 mA cm −2 and en- 
ergy eﬃciency of 75.8% at 30 mA cm −2 than the ones with Naﬁon 
117. 

However, it should be noted that, while the above mentioned 
studies  have  proven  grafting  as  a  promising  method  for  mem- 
brane performance improvement, the radiation techniques such as 
UV  and  plasma  always  require  speciﬁc  reactors,  which  demands 
high  capital  and  energy  costs  [59] .  Moreover,  in  order  to  fur- 
ther improve the membrane and system performance, the graft- 
ing yields, as a crucial factor, requires careful adjustment during 
membrane fabrication. This is because while high grafting yields 
(GY)  can  lead  to  high  IEC  and  membrane  conductivity,  it  could 
also  result  in  polymer  degradation  and  further  reduces  the  bat- 
tery  life-time  [54] .  Hence,  for  the  PVDF-based  membranes,  fur- 
ther  studies  to  carefully  adjust  the  grafting  yields  and  material 
compositions  are  still  needed  before  it  can  truly  achieve  a  bet- 
ter trade-off between membrane conductivity and vanadium ions 
permeability.

5.1.3.7. Sulfonated  poly(phthalazinone  ether  ketone)  (SPPEK)-based. 
Sulfonated poly(phthalazinone ether ketone) (SPPEK) is a polymer 
considered to possess the level of chemical, mechanical and ther- 
mal stabilities required in a membrane. Attributed to the rigid un- 
symmetrical phthanlazinone moiety contained in its backbone, the 
polymer has a high glass transition temperature and a low swelling 
ratio [238] . With these compelling properties, the SPPEK has been 
successfully applied for fabrication of membranes used in VRFBs. 
However,  similar  to  other  sulfonated  aromatic  polymers  such  as 
SPEEK, the performance of the pristine SPPEK membrane with high 
DS is unsatisfactory, therefore various modiﬁcation methods have 
been applied for performance enhancement as well as further ap- 
plications. Most of these prepared membranes with their respec- 
tive performance are summarized in Table S10 [141,237,238] . 

In  order  to  improve  the  proton  conductivity  of  SPPEK-based 
membrane, Wang et al. [237] applied hydrothermal method to fab- 
ricate a SPPEK/WO 
3 hybrid membrane. The introduction of the hy- 
drated WO 
3 ﬁllers successfully improved the water uptake of the 
membrane, which further improved the proton conduction chan- 
nels  and  resulted  in  an  enhanced  membrane  proton  conductiv- 
ity  and  a  slightly  higher  energy  eﬃciency  of  78.6%  when  com- 
pared with Naﬁon 117 at a current density of 50 mA cm −2 . How- 
ever,  inﬂuenced  by  the  increased  proton  conductivity  of  mem- 
brane,  its  vanadium  ions  permeability  also  increased  which  fur- 
ther lead to a larger self-discharge rate compared with the pris- 
tine  SPPEK  membrane.  Other  than  introducing  inorganic  mate- 
rials,  a  better  performance  of  the  SPPEK-based  membranes  was 
achieved  by  a  membrane  fabricated  using  a  series  of  sulfonated 
poly(phthalazinone ether ketone)s containing pendant phenyl moi- 
eties (SPPEK-Ps) [141] . The sulfonic functional groups on the side 
chain of the SPEEK-Ps are considered to improve the proton con- 
ductivity of the membrane, while its mechanical strength was also 
observed  to  be  relatively  stable  even  after  the  membrane  was 
treated  with  1.5  M  VO 2 +  and  3  M  H 
4  solution  for  60  days. 
The  VRFBs  assembled  with  this  membrane  achieved  a  compara- 
ble performance with Naﬁon 115 with an energy eﬃciency of 83% 
at  60  mA  cm −2 ,  as  shown  in  Fig.  9 (a).  In  summary,  the  SPPEK- 
based membranes provide the battery with a lot of improved per- 
formance,  even  though  their  capacity  retention  ability  and  rate 
performance still require further enhancement in the future. The 
SPPEK could be a promising candidate for real application in the 
future after further modiﬁcation. 

2 SO 

ether  ketone  sulfone)s  [251] ,  poly(propene)  [252,253] ,  and  oth- 
ers [120,254–263] have also been used in membrane preparation. 
Here, the performance of these membrane materials for applica- 
tion in VRFBs are discussed. 

In  one  of  these  studies,  a  PAEK-based  membrane  with  long 
aliphatic pendant sulfonated groups was prepared towards obtain- 
ing  a  membrane  suitable  for  application  in  VRFBs  [242] .  It  was 
found that the long aliphatic side chains can protect the membrane 
from vanadium ions, which not only ensure a low vanadium-ions 
permeability, but also enhance the chemical stability of the mem- 
brane. Such design hence allows the composite membrane with a 
stable performance for  100 cycles  achieving a capacity  retention 
rate of ~55%. In another work, a membrane with better chemical 
stability was demonstrated using a synthesized poly(p-phenylene)- 
based copolymers with controlled molecular weights [246] . It was 
found that, due to the rigid polymer structure, this obtained mem- 
brane not only achieved a stable and high eﬃciency for over 100 
cycles at 50 mA cm −2 ,but further achieves a capacity retention rate 
of 43% after 10 0 0 cycles as shown in Fig. 9 (b). 

Other  than  these  materials  mentioned  above,  the  importance 
of  DS on  the  membrane performance has  again been proven by 
another material [87,247] . A series of membranes using crosslink- 
able sulfonated poly (diallyl-bisphenol ether ether ketone) mem- 
branes with various DS were prepared, which were later employed 
and  tested  in  VRFBs  [247] .  It  was  found  that  the  ionic  conduc- 
tivity  of  the  membrane  is  greatly  inﬂuenced  by  the  DS,  while 
the vanadium-ion permeability is affected by both the membrane 
thickness  and  DS.  Compared  to  Naﬁon  115,  the  obtained  mem- 
brane presented a much lower vanadium-ion permeability with a 
higher coulombic eﬃciency of 98% at 50 mA cm −2  and a lower 
self-discharge rate. In addition, the membrane also achieved a sta- 
ble performance for 900 hours. 

In summary, many different materials have been employed for 
the purpose of preparing cation-exchange membranes for ﬂow bat- 
teries. However, there are still no suitable cation-exchange mem- 
brane  with  excellent  battery  performance  and  facile  production 
method  that  can  completely  replace  or  compete  with  the  com- 
mercial Naﬁon membranes. Therefore, more efforts are still needed 
towards the development of suitable cation-exchange membranes 
other than the Naﬁon membranes.

ity  of  the  membrane  [264] .  Unlike  the  cation-exchange  mem- 
branes, anion-exchange membranes are made up of ﬁxed cationic

groups on the polymer backbone to effectively restrict the trans- 
port of vanadium ions which in turn leads to improved coulom- 
bic  eﬃciency  of  battery  system,  as  shown  in  Fig.  4 (b).  As  a  re- 
sult of this, the anion-exchange membranes have been employed 
in  a  number  of  investigations  and  studies  in  VRFBs.  However, 
the wide application of anion-exchange membranes in ﬂow bat- 
tery  systems  is  hindered  by  poor  ionic  conductivity  and  chem- 
ical  stability.  A  lot  of  research  efforts  have  been  put  into  the 
development  of  anion-exchange  membranes  for  ﬂow  batteries 
through  the  development  and  investigations  of  various  materi- 
als such as polysulfone (PSF), [86,126,264–272] poly(phthalazinone 
ether ketone) (PPEK), [95] poly(phthalazinone ether ketone ketone) 
(PPEKK), [273,274] poly(aryl ether ketone) (PAEK), [275–278] PES, 
[279,280] poly(ﬂuorenyl ether), [281] PBI, [282,283] polyvinyl chlo- 
ride,  [96]  poly(phenylene),  [284]  PE,  [285]  poly(phenyl  sulfone), 
[92]  poly(arylene  ether  sulfone)  (PAES),  [286]  and  many  others 
[60,83,101,105,287–301] . In the following sections, we discussed in 
detail some of the prominent materials for anion-exchange mem- 
branes that have achieved superior battery performance. 

5.2.1. Polysulfone (PSF)-based 

As discussed earlier, polysulfone (PSF) is a polymer well known 
for its mechanical, thermal and chemical stabilities suitable for the 
preparation of membranes. It has therefore also been used to pre- 
pare some anion-exchange membranes [86,126,264–272] for VRFBs. 
Some of these PSF-based anion-exchange membranes recently re- 
ported are summarized in Table S11 [86,269–272] . Among these 
previously  reported  studies,  two  of  them  where  extremely  high 
coulombic eﬃciency was achieved due to superior blocking effects 
towards vanadium ions are discussed below. 

In one of these studies, the cross-linking strategy was employed 
during  the  membrane  preparation,  which  is  regarded  as  one  of 
the common modiﬁcation methods to create reinforced structure 
which  offers  high  mechanical  stability.  This  fabricated  PSF/PVDF 
membrane  was  crosslinked  via  the  cation-  and  dication-forming 
reactions, which was then proven to possess well-balanced prop- 
erties [265] . The membrane was further found to achieve a much 
lower self-discharge rate, compared to the Naﬁon membranes, with 
a stable coulombic eﬃciency of 99% for more than 900 cycles as 
shown  in  Fig.  10 (a),  demonstrating  its  compelling  performance. 
In another study, PVDF was added into quaternized PSF, as pre- 
sented  in  Fig.  10 (b)  [86] .  It  was  observed  that  due  to  the  Don- 
nan exclusion effect between the ﬁxed anion-exchange groups and 
vanadium ions, the vanadium ions are effectively blocked by the 
composite  membrane. Furthermore,  the  swelling behavior of  the 

membrane was also greatly suppressed due to the crystallization 
of PVDF. Consequently, this PSF-based anion-exchange membrane 
achieved a coulombic eﬃciency of ~100%. However, it is worth to 
note that, while the PSF-based membranes show superior perfor- 
mance and great potential for future applications, their ionic con- 
ductivity are not as good as the commercial Naﬁon membranes. 
Therefore, studies to address this particular limitation of PSF-based 
anion-exchange membranes, while also maintaining their battery 
performance especially under high operating current densities are 
much required. 

5.2.2. Poly(aryl ether ketone) (PAEK)-based 

Poly(aryl ether ketone) (PAEK) is another kind of polymer that 
has  been  used  for  anion-exchange  membrane  development  and 
has been studied and reported for their application in VRFBs, as 
summarized  in  Table  S12  [275–278] .  Among  all  of  these  stud- 
ies,  the  introduction  of  long  aliphatic  imidazolium  groups  onto 
PAEK for anion-exchange membrane preparation was demonstrated 
to achieve an improved battery performance and capacity reten- 
tion  ability  [278] .  The  attached  positively  charged  imidazolium 
groups,  with  their  chemical  stability,  were  majorly  employed  to 
provide the membrane with improved oxidative stability and re- 
duced vanadium ions permeability. The resulting membrane thus 
presented  a  decrease  in  energy  eﬃciency  from  ~87  to  78%  as 
the operating current density increases from 40 to 100 mA cm −2 , 
which are much higher than the performance of Naﬁon 117. Fur- 
thermore, the battery using this PAEK-based membrane showed a 
capacity retention ability of ~84% after 100 cycles, justifying the 
stability of this polymer and its promising potentials for membrane 
preparation suitable for more applications beyond the VRFBs. How- 
ever,  similar  to  most  of  the  anion-exchange  membranes,  one  of 
the major problems of the PAEK-based anion-exchange membrane 
is its poor conductivity, which results in limited voltage eﬃciency 
thereby restraining the energy eﬃciency of the battery especially 
at high operating current densities. Hence, further studies to im- 
prove the conductivity of the PAEK-based membranes while effec- 
tively blocking vanadium-ions therefore remains one of the major 
research directions in the future. 

5.2.3. Other polymers-based 

Other than PSF and PAEK, many other materials have also been 
used for anion-exchange membranes preparation [83,279,281,286] . 
Some  of  these  materials  and  their  performance  when  used  in 
VRFBs are discussed in this section.

Fumasep FAP series from Fumatech GmbH is one of the most 
widely employed commercial AEMs in ﬂow batteries. A number of 
research works have therefore examined the performance of these 
types of membrane in the operations of VRFBs [101,106,302,303] . 
In comparison to Naﬁon 112 (CE: 93%, VE: 87% and EE: 81%), FAP- 
450 has been reported to achieve higher CE (98%), lower VE (84%), 
and a comparable EE (82%) when operated at 40 mA cm −2 [303] . 
Such performance therefore indicates that the commercial FAP-450 
AEM is able to effectively suppress the crossover of vanadium ions 
while it allows an easy transport of anions. However, in order to 
further minimize the vanadium ions permeability of this commer- 
cial AEM, the sol-gel synthesis method has been applied to mod- 
ify a FAP membrane using silica nanoparticles. The prepared silica 
nanocomposite membrane was demonstrated to further hinder the 
permeation of vanadium ions, which in turn leads to a longer self- 
discharge duration. As a result, the membrane further achieved a 
9% higher CE with a 5% higher EE compared to the pristine FAP 
membrane [101] . However, this FAP membrane even after modiﬁ- 
cation is still found to present lower VE compared to the Naﬁon 
series especially at high operating current density as a result of 
its limited ionic conductivity. This therefore restricts the operating 
current density range of FAP membranes. 

Other than the commercial FAP membranes, imidazolium-based 
structures, due to their high ionic conductivity and chemical stabil- 
ity, has been introduced into PAES for membrane preparation for 
performance  improvement  [286] .  The  obtained  membranes  were 
assembled into VRFBs and the test results showed that, compared 
to Naﬁon 117, the fabricated membranes achieved a slight lower 
voltage  eﬃciency  of  75.6%  with  a  much  higher  coulombic  eﬃ- 
ciency  of  96.1%  at  120  mA  cm −2 ,  demonstrating  the  addition  of 
imidazolium-based  structures  as  a  potential  strategy  to  achieve 
better conductivity for the anion-exchange membranes. 

Other  than  the  relatively  low  voltage  eﬃciency  as  a  result 
of  the  low  membrane  ionic  conductivity,  poor  chemical  stabil- 
ity is another lingering issue that hinders the real application of 
anion-exchange membranes. In order to improve the chemical sta- 
bility  of  anion-exchange  membranes,  Zeng  et  al.  [83]  therefore 
prepared a pyridinium-functionalized cross-linked anion-exchange 
membrane  with  chemical  inertness  backbone.  Due  to  the  inter- 
nal cross-linking networks of the membrane and the Donnan ex- 
clusion  effect,  the  permeation  of  VO 2 +  ions  through  the  mem- 
brane is greatly hampered, while its chemical stability is greatly 
improved. The membrane further presented an improved balance 
between the ionic conductivity and vanadium-ion permeability to 
attain a coulombic eﬃciency of ~98-99% and voltage eﬃciency of 
~92-77.5%  at  100-250  mA  cm −2 .  Furthermore,  it  reveals  a  cycle 
stability of operating for 537 cycles at 200 mA cm −2  with a ca- 
pacity decay rate of 0.037% per cycle, as shown in Fig. 11 (a). An- 
other example demonstrating an anion-exchange membrane with 

extremely superior chemical stability was achieved by a PES-PVP 
blend  anion-exchange  membrane  [279] .  The  combination  of  PVP 
and  PES  successfully  retains  the  advantages  of  each  material  to 
provide  the  membrane  with  mechanical  stability,  hydrophilicity, 
and low vanadium-ion permeability. The battery assembled with 
the obtained PES-PVP membrane achieved a coulombic eﬃciency 
of 99% at a rate of 50 C and operated for 26,0 0 0 cycles thereby 
validating its excellent stability as shown in Fig. 11 (b). 

In  summary,  the  anion-exchange  membranes  have  received  a 
number of investigations and studies in the last decade to show- 
case their applications and performance improvement in ﬂow bat- 
tery technology. However, for the anion-exchange membranes to 
be widely applied, further  experimental studies  are still needed. 
Not  only  the  ionic  conductivity  and  chemical  stability  of  anion- 
exchange membrane need further improvement, but also the fab- 
rication methods of the membrane need to be addressed. 

5.3. Amphoteric-ion exchange membranes 

To date, several materials and fabrication methods have been 
developed  to  enhance  the  application  of  cation-exchange  and 
anion-exchange  membranes  in  ﬂow  battery  systems.  However, 
some  lingering  deﬁciencies  of  these  membranes  have  also  been 
pointed  out.  For  instance,  the  cation-exchange  membranes  gen- 
erally  suffer  from  high  vanadium-ion  permeability,  while  the 
anion-exchange  membranes  are  of  low  ionic  conductivity.  Thus, 
in  order  to  achieve  a  membrane  that  combines  the  advanta- 
geous  properties  of  these  two  membranes  -  high  ionic  conduc- 
tivity  and  restricted  transport  of  vanadium  ions,  the  idea  of  at- 
taching both anionic and cationic functional groups onto a mem- 
brane  backbone  has  been  proposed  and  named  the  amphoteric- 
ion  exchange  membrane.  The  amphoteric-ion  exchange  mem- 
brane,  shown  in  Fig.  4  (c),  therefore  combines  the  advantages 
of cation and anion-exchange membranes while minimizing their 
respective  drawbacks.  Some  of  the  various  materials  that  have 
been  utilized  in  the  preparation  of  amphoteric-ion  exchange 
membranes  for  VRFBs  include  PVDF,  [304–307]  poly(ethylene- 
co-tetraﬂuoroethylene)  (ETFE),  [308,309]  SPEEK,  [310–312]  PE, 
[313] and other materials [127,314–318] . 

5.3.1. Poly(vinylidene ﬂuoride) (PVDF)-based 

Poly(vinylidene  ﬂuoride)  (PVDF),  as  discussed  earlier,  is  a 
widely used polymer for membrane preparation. It has also been 
reported  for  the  preparation  of  amphoteric-ion  exchange  mem- 
branes  [305–307] .  The  performance  and  properties  of  promi- 
nent  PVDF-based  amphoteric-ion  exchange  membranes  recently 
reported are summarized in Table S13 [304–307] while some of 
these materials that have seemingly contributed to the improve- 
ment of battery performances are discussed in this section.

In an attempt to provide the PVDF-based membranes with low 
vanadium ions permeability, St and dimethylaminoethyl methacry- 
late  were  grafted  onto  PVDF  ﬁlm  using  the  γ -irradiation  tech- 
nique for amphoteric-ion exchange membrane preparation [304] . 
The  obtained  amphoteric-ion  exchange  membrane  was  found  to 
maintain  the  battery  voltage  over  1.2  V  for  68  hours  prov- 
ing  its  low  vanadium-ion  permeability,  which  was  attributed  to 
the  Donnan  exclusion  effect  between  the  cation  groups  and  the 
vanadium  ions.  Elsewhere,  sodium  styrene  sulfonate  (SSS)  and 
N,N-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate have also been successfully 
grafted into the PVDF ﬁlm using this technique, followed by pro- 
tonation  process  to  obtain  an  amphoteric-ion  exchange  mem- 
brane [307] . It was found that the increasing composition of N,N- 
dimethylaminoethyl  methacrylate  can  reduce  vanadium-ion  per- 
meability of the membrane, which in turn enables the prepared 
membrane  to  achieve  a  low  self-discharge  rate  and  allows  the 
VRFB to be maintained at an OCV higher than 1.4 V for 85 hours 
as  shown  in  ( Fig.  12 (a)).  However,  while  the γ -irradiation  tech- 
nique can introduce functional groups into the membrane, it can 
also potentially result in their non-uniform distribution. Hence, to 
allow a more uniform distribution of ion-exchange groups, the ra- 
diation  grafting  technique  and  solution  phase  inversion  method 
has been combined for membrane preparation ( Fig. 12 (b)) [305] . 
During the preparation, the PVDF powder was ﬁrstly grafted with 
St and dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate and then fabricated into 
a  membrane  through  the  solution  phase  inversion  method.  This 
membrane, after sulfonation and protonation treatment, becomes 

the ﬁnal amphoteric-ion exchange membrane needed. It was found 
that,  the  membrane  prepared  with  the  combination  of  radiation 
grafting technique and solution phase inversion method resulted in 
a uniform grafting throughout the membrane structure. This there- 
fore provides the membrane with a higher conductivity compared 
to the amphoteric-ion exchange membranes prepared through per- 
forming grafting directly on the PVDF ﬁlm. However, this also in- 
creases the vanadium ions permeability of the membrane. In sum- 
mary, the PVDF has been proven to be a polymer with great po- 
tential for the preparation of amphoteric-ion exchange membrane, 
while its modiﬁcation especially through grafting technique needs 
further attentions to ensure uniformity of ion-exchange group dis- 
tribution for improved battery performance. 

5.3.2. Other polymers-based 

Other than the aforementioned materials, other materials such 
as polysufone (PS) [316] , SPEEK [310,311] , and PPEK [314,315] have 
also  been  used  for  the  preparation  of  amphoteric-ion  exchange 
membrane. One of these studies examined the effects of GY dur- 
ing the preparation process, which is an important factor that de- 
termines the membrane performance [308] . The radiation-induced 
grafting technique was employed during the membrane prepara- 
tion  process  while  both  anionic  and  cationic  groups  were  suc- 
cessfully introduced into the poly(ethylene-co-tetraﬂuoroethylene) 
(ETFE) ﬁlm. Through controlling the GY during the preparation pro- 
cess, vanadium-ion permeability and ionic conductivity of the fab- 
ricated  membrane  can  be  easily  adjusted.  The  obtained  optimal

amphoteric-ion exchange membrane showed a reduced vanadium 
ions permeability compared to cation-exchange membranes and an 
improved ionic conductivity than anion-exchange membranes. As a 
result, the VRFB assembled with the obtained amphoteric-ion ex- 
change membranes attained a coulombic eﬃciency of 95.6% and an 
energy eﬃciency of 87.9% at 40 mA cm −2 . Elsewhere, an improved 
battery performance was reported to be demonstrated by a SPEEK 
and quaternized poly(ether imide) (QAPEI) composite amphoteric- 
ion  exchange  membrane  [312] .  The  introduction  of  QAPEI  was 
found  to  greatly  improved  the  selectivity  of  the  amphoteric-ion 
exchange membrane. Moreover, it was found that the membrane 
possessed a high degree of micro-phase separate structure which 
is  considered  to  facilitate  ion  transport.  This  obtained  compos- 
ite membrane presented higher eﬃciencies than both the pristine 
SPEEK and Naﬁon 115 membranes with a coulombic eﬃciency of 
96.1% and an energy eﬃciency of 88.45% at 50 mA cm −2 as shown 
in Fig. 13 . 

However,  the  amphoteric-ion  exchange  membrane  is  still  far 
from real application up till now. This is mainly attributed to the 
following reasons: i) the preparation of these membranes always 
involves complex preparation procedures making them unsuitable 
for mass production; and ii) the performance of the batteries uti- 
lizing  these  membranes  are  still  unsatisfactory  especially  under 
high charge-discharge current densities. Thus, more efforts are still 
required towards the preparation and development of amphoteric- 
ion exchange membranes suitable for wide application in ﬂow bat- 
teries. 

5.4. Porous membranes 

Even  though  several  types  of  polymer  electrolyte  membrane 
have been proposed and developed for application in ﬂow batter- 
ies,  their  high  cost  and  complicated  preparation  procedures  still 
hinder their wide applications and thus require further investiga- 

tions for improvement. The porous membrane guided by the idea 
of separating the protons and other cations via the size exclusion 
effect has therefore attracted a lot of attentions and investigations 
[319] . It is worth to note that porous membranes for VRFBs has 
received a considerable research attention, particularly by Huamin 
Zhang and his research group [320–328] . 

The  ideal  porous  membrane  requires  a  well-deﬁned  ion- 
transport channel that promotes easy transport of protons while 
hindering  the  transport  of  other  metal  ions,  thereby  provid- 
ing  the  battery  with  high  eﬃciencies.  The  working  principle  of 
a  porous  membrane  when  employed  in  VRFBs  is  illustrated  in 
Fig.  4 (d).  Researchers  have  used  various  materials  such  as  PBI, 
[74,326,328–336]  PES,  [240,241,319,320,322–324,337–343]  poly- 
acrylonitrile  (PAN),  [325,344,345]  porous glass,  [346–349]  PSF, 
[327,350-352] PVDF, [116,321,353,354] and others [145,355] using 
various preparation methods to obtain porous membranes. 

5.4.1. Polybenzimidazole (PBI)-based 

Polybenzimidazole (PBI) is a type of heterocyclic polymers well 
known for its high glass transition temperature, superior thermal, 
mechanical and chemical stabilities [336] . These properties there- 
fore  make  it  suitable  for  applications  in  an  acidic  and  corrosive 
electrolyte environment such as VRFBs [74,139,334] . While PBI has 
been widely studied and investigated for the preparation of porous 
membranes for ﬂow batteries, the major challenge of the pristine 
PBI membranes is poor proton conductivity. 

To enhance their proton conductivity, PBI membranes are com- 
monly  treated  with  strong  acid,  so  that  the  imidazole  group  on 
PBI backbone could be protonated and form the acid-based com- 
plex which is conductive for proton transport. Moreover, the pos- 
itively charged imidazole group can also repel the vanadium ions 
by Donnan effect, limiting the vanadium ions permeability. Zhao 
et al. [139] ﬁrst studied the application of PBI membrane in VRFB 
in 2015, after the development of a PBI porous membrane for ap-

plication in fuel cells. They have deeply investigated the ionic con- 
ductivity,  vanadium-ion  permeability,  chemical  stability  and  bat- 
tery performance of the sulfuric-doped PBI porous membrane, to 
demonstrate  the  PBI  membrane  as  a  promising  candidate  suit- 
able for ﬂow battery operation. However, while the acid treatment 
could improve the proton conductivity of PBI membrane, its con- 
ductivity was still relatively low, thereby leading to limited voltage 
eﬃciency at high operating current densities. To further improve 
the performance of PBI-based membrane in VRFBs, a lot of experi- 
mental studies have therefore been conducted to modify the mem- 
brane and some positive results have been achieved. 

One  of  the  successful  effort s  to  eﬃciently  improve  the  pro- 
ton conductivity of PBI-based membrane was conducted by Chen 
et  al.  [330]  where  they  introduced  pyridine  groups  into  the  PBI 
membrane.  The  pyridine  groups  and  imidazole  rings  inside  the 
PBI forms the dual proton transport channels, which is expected 
to effectively enhance the proton transport across the membrane. 
Moreover, the positively charged acid-doped pyridine and imida- 
zole groups was found to repel the vanadium-ions to achieve low 
vanadium ions permeability while still exhibiting its high ion con- 
ductivity. Utilizing this method, a coulombic eﬃciency of 99% and 
a voltage eﬃciency of ~80%, were obtained which are even higher 
than those of Naﬁon 115 membrane. Furthermore, the membrane 
also demonstrates a stable performance for 600 cycles. 

Another strategy to control the balance between proton conduc- 
tivity  and  vanadium-ions  permeability  is  by  modifying  the  mor- 
phology  of  porous  membranes.  Huamin  Zhang  and  his  research 
group  have  notably  performed  extensive  studies  on  controlling 
the morphology of PBI membranes for performance improvement 
[326,328,335] .  In  2016,  they  ﬁrst  prepared  a  sponge-like  porous 
PBI  membrane  using  the  typical  vapor  induced  phase  inversion 
method  [328] .  Such  membrane  morphology  was  found  to  effec- 
tively create multiple barriers to vanadium ions, which hence lim- 
its the permeability of vanadium ions and thereby results in high 
ions  selectivity.  The  obtained  membrane  ﬁnally  achieved  an  as- 
tonishing stable operation of over 130 0 0 cycles at a current den- 
sity ranging from 80 to 120 mA cm −2 , presenting an energy eﬃ- 
ciency of ~80% as shown in Fig. 14 (a), successfully demonstrating 
the excellent chemical stability of the prepared membrane. Consid- 
ering the diﬃculties associated with the traditional vapor-induced 
phase  separation  method,  the  research  group  later  developed  a 
nonsolvent-induced phase separation method for the preparation 
of porous PBI membrane. During this phase separation process, the 
membrane morphology can be controlled by altering the concen- 
trations of the salt solution, which is environmentally friendly and 
suitable for mass production [326] . It was found that the porous 
membrane could achieve the balance between vanadium ions per- 

meability and ionic conductivity through appropriate optimization 
of membrane morphology. Moreover, the structure was found to 
possess high stability, which enables the fabricated membrane to 
achieve a similar stable operation for 10 0 0 0 cycles, with an energy 
eﬃciency of ~80% at 160 mA cm −2 , as shown in Fig. 14 (b). 

Considering the recent applications of PBI-based membranes in 
VRFBs as summarized in Table S14 [74,326,328-336] , these com- 
pelling performances have suggested eﬃcient direction for PBI im- 
provement,  thereby  promoting  the  PBI  as  a  promising  candidate 
for preparing porous membranes for viable applications in the fu- 
ture. It is worth to note that while some of the modiﬁcation meth- 
ods can improve the proton conductivity of PBI, they may on the 
other hand affect other properties of the membrane, such as ions 
selectivity and mechanical strength. Hence, further investigations 
are still required to achieve an optimal balance between the vari- 
ous properties. 

5.4.2. Poly(ether sulfone) (PES)-based 

Poly (ether sulfone) (PES), with its excellent chemical and me- 
chanical  stability,  has  been  widely  used  for  membrane  prepara- 
tion as well as in separation processes such as ultraﬁltration and 
nanoﬁltration  [240] .  A  summary  of  the  properties  and  perfor- 
mance  of  the  recently  reported  PES-based  porous  membranes  is 
presented in Table S15 [241,319,320,322,337-342] . Among the PES- 
based membranes, tuning the membrane pores is one of the most 
common strategies with the aim to obtain an optimal trade-off be- 
tween vanadium-ion permeability and proton conductivity. Some 
of such cases where this strategy was utilized and achieved satis- 
factory battery performance are discussed in this section. 

Hydrophilic PVP was incorporated into PES for membrane mor- 
phology adjustment, which results in a membrane with more pores 
and  bigger  pore  size  distribution  [240] .  After  the  modiﬁcation 
of  the  membrane  morphology,  it  was  found  that  the  membrane 
achieved a voltage eﬃciency of 82-85% at 80 mA cm −2 and a sta- 
ble performance for 150 cycles, demonstrating that the pore size 
and  pore  distribution  play  an  important  role  in  inﬂuencing  the 
performance  of  porous  membranes.  In  another  attempt  for  pore 
structure  modiﬁcation,  a  series  of  porous  PES/SPEEK  membranes 
with a structure made of hydrophobic porous PES matrix and in- 
terconnected hydrophilic small pores were prepared [319] . It was 
found that with the introduction of SPEEK, the membrane with a 
more uniform pore structure and improved ionic conductivity was 
achieved. After solvent treatment, the polymer chains were reor- 
ganized, which led to the shrinkage of membrane pores to achieve 
low vanadium-ion permeability with improved ion selectivity. The 
VRFBs assembled with this membrane ﬁnally present a coulombic

eﬃciency of 99% and an energy eﬃciency of over 91% at 80 mA

Apart from blending with other polymers, the PES membrane 
can  also  be  modiﬁed  by  introducing  hydrophilic  layers  onto  the 
pore  and  surface  of  the  membrane  to  create  well-deﬁned  ions 
transport channels and therefore result to high ionic conductivity. 
Xu et al. [323] , for the ﬁrst time, introduced multilayered PDDA 
and  poly  (acrylic  acid)  (PAA)  complexes  on  the  inner  pore  and 
surface of the PES/SPEEK membrane through a solvent-responsive 
layer-by-layer assembly technique as shown in Fig. 15 (b). After the 
modiﬁcation, the pore size of the membrane decreased while its 
hydrophilicity  improved,  to  indicate  its  ions  selectivity  and  con- 
ductivity improvement. Moreover, by placing the PES/SPEEK-based 
membrane  in  various  solvents  (isopropanol,  methanol  and  ethy- 
lene  glycol)  so  as  to  swell  before introducing  other  polymers,  it 
was proved that the swelling effect of solvent can adjust the free 
volume of polymer and provide more opening space for the de- 
position  of  other  layers  on  the  membrane  pores.  The  obtained 
membrane  successfully  achieved  an  improved  balance  between 
vanadium-ion permeability and ionic conductivity thereby exhibit- 
ing an improved performance at various charge/discharge current 
densities. 

With these achieved performance and properties, the PES-based 
porous membrane is therefore considered to possess great poten- 
tial to achieve real application after further improvement. Speciﬁ- 
cally, future studies should focus more on providing the membrane 
with better balance between ionic conductivity and vanadium-ions 
permeability. 

5.4.3. Polyacrylonitrile (PAN)-based 

Other than the PES and PBI, polyacrylonitrile (PAN) is another 
material  that  has  been  commonly  used  for  porous  membranes 
preparation. Some of their properties and performances in VRFBs 
are  summarized  in  Table  S16  [325,344,345] .  To  understand  the 
properties of PAN-based nanoﬁltration membrane, the pore sizes 
of the membrane have been tuned and investigated using strate- 
gies such as adjusting polymer concentration and adding volatile 
cosolvents [344] . The experimental results revealed that the decre- 
ment of pore sizes leads to an increase in ion selectivity. The VRFBs 
assembled with the obtained membrane achieved an energy eﬃ- 
ciency of 76% at 80 mA cm −2 . Using another method, the same 
research team modiﬁed the PAN-based membrane in order to re- 
duce the membrane pore size while maintaining its ionic conduc- 
tivity.  They  therefore  introduced  various  silica  contents  into  the 
pores and surface of another PAN-based nanoﬁltration membrane 
via in situ hydrolysis of tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) [325] . It was 
found that after the introduction of silica, the ion selectivity of the 

membrane is greatly enhanced, thereby results in an improved en- 
ergy eﬃciency of 79% at 80 mA cm −2 . It was also found that, for 
the rate performance, the membrane with the optimized hydrolysis 
treatment is reported to exhibit a coulombic eﬃciency of 91-98% at 
current densities of 40-80 mA cm −2 , as shown in Fig. 16 (a). 

Apart from the modiﬁcations as discussed above, the coating of 
microporous polymer on PAN for membrane fabrication has also 
been examined and proven to be an effective method. The PIM- 
1  polymer,  which  is  the  ﬁrst  generation  polymer  possessing  the 
intrinsic  microporosity  has  been  coated  onto  PAN  ultraﬁltration 
membrane for membrane preparation [345] . With the small pore 
size  and  water  molecules  inside  the  membrane,  the  membrane 
showed a higher permeation rate for protons than vanadium ions. 
Following  this,  the  VRFB  equipped  with  PIM-1/PAN  showed  ex- 
tremely high energy eﬃciency of ~98.7% at a low current density 
of  1  mA  cm −2 ,  and maintained the  energy  eﬃciency  above  85% 
within  the  low  current  density  ranging  from  1  to  40  mA  cm −2 , 
which outperforms the Naﬁon series as shown in Fig. 16 (b). While 
such results prove the potential of involving inherent microporos- 
ity materials for membrane fabrication, it is worth to emphasize 
that, due to the high resistance of this particular membrane, large 
ohmic loss is a key limitation for its cell-level performance, espe- 
cially when operating at high current densities. Hence, up till now, 
the relatively poor ionic conductivity of the PAN-based membranes 
is still one of the lingering challenges before achieving their real 
applications, which therefore requires more research attentions. 

5.4.4. Porous glass-based 

Porous glass is another notable material that has been used for 
porous membrane fabrication. Some major studies on the applica- 
tion of porous glass membranes in VRFBs are summarized in Table 
S17 [346-349] . The usage of porous glass for membrane prepara- 
tion allows the modiﬁcation of pore sizes and pore surface to re- 
duce the crossover of vanadium ions. The porous glass membrane 
can be obtained by modifying the pristine non-porous glass via the 
speciﬁc heat treatment with suitable acidic and alkaline leaching 
steps. After the treatment, the modiﬁed membrane can generally 
maintain superior chemical and thermal stability as a result of the 
high ratio of silica composition [347,356] . Furthermore, such mate- 
rial possesses large geometrical ﬂexibility and allows manufactur- 
ing of various shapes and with thickness down to 150 μm [347] . 

The  ﬁrst  application  of  porous  glass  for  membrane  prepara- 
tion was reported by Fang et al. in 2003 [346] , where Vycor glass 
with a pore size of around 4.5 nm was used. The investigations on 
the membrane showed that it advantageously possesses low vana- 
dium ions permeability. During the discharge tests carried out, the 
porous  glass  membrane  was  found  to  maintain  a  coulombic  ef-

ﬁciency of ~97% with an open circuit voltage of about 1.5 V for 
over 72 h, indicating the negligible self-discharge effect due to the 
low crossover of vanadium ions. However, the ohmic resistance of 
this membrane was still relatively high, which hence limited the 
voltage eﬃciency of the system. Later, Mögelin et al. [349] investi- 
gated series of porous silica glass membranes with pore sizes rang- 
ing from 2 to 50 nm and thickness of 300 and 500 μm. While 
a  smaller  pore  size  can  effectively  limit  the  crossover  of  vana- 
dium ions through the membrane, the transport of protons is more 
likely to be hindered, which could reduce the ionic conductivity of 
the membrane. Overall, the membrane with an optimal pore size 
(8 nm) achieved the highest energy eﬃciency of 76.3% at 20 mA 
cm −2 . Besides, porous glass membrane also shows stability at high 
operating temperatures, as it possesses adequate thermal tolerance 
due to the rigid and non-swelling pore structure [348] . 

While these advantages show great prospects for porous glass 
membranes  for  further  applications  in  ﬂow  battery  systems,  the 
membrane still has its own shortcomings such as low ionic con- 
ductivity, and poor mechanical stability. In an attempt to improve 
the  ionic  conductivity  of  the  membrane,  the  pore  surface  of  a 
porous  glass  membrane  was  modiﬁed  with  sulfonic  acid  groups 
[347] . However, while the involvement of sulfonic acid groups was 
supposed  to  facilitate  protons  transport  through  the  membrane, 
the pores of the membrane were observed to be blocked which 
in turn reduce the ion conducting channels. Consequently, satisfac- 
tory improvement in the ionic conductivity of the membrane was 
not achieved even after these modiﬁcations. In this case, further 
studies are therefore still required to fully address the poor ionic 
conductivity of the porous glass membranes, while their poor me- 
chanical stability is another barrier that should also be considered 
for further investigations. 

5.4.5. Other polymers-based 

Other  materials  including  PVDF  [116,353,354] ,  PSF  [350-352] , 
and many others [145,327,355] have also been used for the prepa- 
ration  of  porous  membranes.  Among  these  materials,  the  use  of 
PVDF for porous membrane has been reported to enhance battery 
performance to certain level as discussed below. 

As introduced in previous sections, PVDF is a polymer with ex- 
cellent mechanical, chemical and thermal stabilities. Its application 
for preparing porous membrane for VRFBs was ﬁrst reported by 
Zhang and his research group [116] . They fabricated a PVDF-based 
ultraﬁltration membrane using the phase inversion method. Ow- 
ing  to  the  hydrophobic  membrane pore  walls  and  the  effects  of 
pore constriction, the membrane achieved a coulombic eﬃciency 
of 95% and an energy eﬃciency of 78.6% at a current density of 
80 mA cm −2 . In addition, the membrane attained a stable opera- 
tion for 10 0 0 cycles due to the excellent chemical stability of PVDF 

thereby providing the VRFB with improved stability. However, due 
to the hydrophobic nature of the PVDF polymer, poor ionic conduc- 
tivity plays an important role in limiting the battery performance. 
Hence,  in  order  to  ease  the  proton  transport  through  the  mem- 
brane, a highly hydrophilic poly(vinyl pyirolidone) (PVP) layer was 
introduced into the pores and onto the surface of PVDF membrane 
via cross-linking reaction and grafting polymerization with a sol- 
vent swelling pre-treatment [321] . The modiﬁed PVDF membrane 
combined the compelling properties of different materials together, 
and thus exhibited adequate chemical and mechanical stability af- 
ter over 300 charge-discharge cycle tests. Moreover, as expected a 
high energy eﬃciency of 83.3% was achieved at the same current 
density (80 mA cm −2 ) demonstrating its improved battery perfor- 
mance. Hence, with the comparable battery-level performance of 
PVDF-based membrane and its much lower cost against those of 
the conventional Naﬁon membranes, the PVDF-based membrane is 
considered as a potential substitute to Naﬁon in the future. Based 
on all of these results, the porous membranes have been proven 
suitable  to  contribute  to  the  performance  improvement  of  ﬂow 
batteries. However, before their real applications in the future, fur- 
ther studies especially on their performances under high charge- 
discharge current densities are still needed, which should be re- 
garded as one of the major research focus on porous membranes. 

5.5. Summary 

In this section, the different types of membrane that have been 
developed for VRFBs, based on the major materials used, have been 
divided into different sub-sections and extensively discussed. Fol- 
lowing this, a comprehensive table ( Table 1 ) summarizing the ma- 
jor membrane-materials discussed and their performance is pre- 
sented. It can be seen that, among the various Naﬁon series mem- 
branes, the commercial Naﬁon 115 membrane [67] , have been re- 
ported to possess the best balance between its various properties 
to  produce  excellent  performance  in  VRFBs  with  an  energy  eﬃ- 
ciency  of  54%  at  320  mA  cm −2  and  a  capacity  retention  ability 
of  50%  after  152  cycles.  Another  commercial  membrane,  named, 
VANADion [108] has been reported to achieve a higher energy ef- 
ﬁciency of ~72% at the same current density with a capacity reten- 
tion ability of ~93.2% after 85 cycles operation compared to the 
commercial  Naﬁon  115  membrane.  Other  than  the  Naﬁon-based 
membranes, SPEEK is another material that has been mostly stud- 
ied for its usage in the fabrication of cation-exchange membranes 
and  have  achieved  notable  performance  in  VRFBs.  One  of  the 
SPEEK-based cation-exchange membranes [191] has been reported 
to  present  the  best  performance,  with  an  energy  eﬃciency  of 
80.1% at a current density of 180 mA cm −2 , while another SPEEK- 
based membrane [192] is reported to achieve an outstanding op-

eration  stability  of  10 0 0  cycles  with  a  capacity  retention  ability 
of ~60%. However, while some of the cation-exchange membranes 
have been reported to achieve an impressive performance on some 
levels,  the  major  downside  of  most  cation-exchange  membranes 
still remains the high vanadium ions permeability. This needs to 
be signiﬁcantly reduced while simultaneously maintaining its high 
ionic  conductivity  to  ensure  high  capacity  retention  ability  after 
long-term operation and high energy eﬃciency under high oper- 
ating current density range. 

For  the  anion-exchange  membranes,  PSF  has  been  pointed 
out  as  the  material  with  the  most  promising  potential  for  fur- 
ther  study.  One  of  the  membranes  prepared  using  this  material 
achieved an energy eﬃciency of ~78% at a current density of 180 
mA cm −2  [270] , while another PSF-based membrane successfully 
operated for an astonishing 60 0 0 cycles [272] . The anion-exchange 
membranes have been commonly reported to possess high capac- 
ity retention ability due to their low vanadium ions permeability. 
However, one of their major drawbacks remains poor ionic conduc- 
tivity, which should be addressed through further studies so as to 
attain high voltage eﬃciency under a wide operating current den- 
sity range. 

Regarding the amphoteric-ion exchange membranes and porous 
membranes, it may be diﬃcult to point out the membrane mate- 
rial with the most promising potential for further applications due 
to the limited studies that have been carried out on these materi- 
als. Nonetheless, the PBI and PES seem to be the dominant mate- 
rials for the preparation of porous membranes at present. It is also 
worth to note that a particular PBI-based porous membrane has 
successfully demonstrated a stable operation with a capacity reten- 
tion ability of 68% after 1350 cycles [328] , and a PES-based porous 
membrane has been reported to exhibit an energy eﬃciency of 80% 
at  a  current  density  of  260  mA  cm −2  with  a  capacity  retention 
of 93% for 100 cycle operation [338] . These results achieved from 
these materials, particularly for porous membranes, provide an in- 
sight that better and improved performance could be attained with 
further  investigations.  Moreover,  the  methods  to  accurately  tune 
the concentration of anion-exchange groups and cation-exchange 
groups in an amphoteric-ion exchange membrane as well as tune 
the pore sizes and pore structure for a porous membrane still re- 
quire  further  investigations.  Such  methods  would  deﬁnitely  play 
important  roles  in  determining  the  membrane  performance  to- 
wards obtaining the ideal membrane suitable for VRFBs. 

6. Transport mechanisms 

As mentioned earlier, polymer electrolyte membrane, as an in- 
tegral component of a ﬂow battery system not only provide path- 
ways for ionic transport, but also prevents cross-contamination of 
electrolytes. During the operation of VRFBs, vanadium ions (V 2 + , 
+ ),  protons,  and  water,  all  possess  the  tendency 
V 3 + ,  VO 2 + ,  VO 
2 
to  be  transferred  across  the  membrane  through  various  mecha- 
nisms  which  consequently  result  to  the  complex  mass  transport 
and  highly  coupled  transport  processes  within  the  battery  sys- 
tem. This complex transport phenomena therefore leads to concen- 
tration and volume imbalance between the two electrolytes, self- 
discharge, and undesired side reactions which in turn signiﬁcantly 
affect the cycling processes and eﬃciencies of VRFBs. In this sec- 
tion, the transport phenomena of vanadium ions, protons, and wa- 
ter through polymer electrolyte membranes are discussed. 

6.1. Proton transport 

Proton (H + ) is one of the positive charges present in VRFB elec- 
trolytes resulting from the dissociation of sulfuric acid in the elec- 
trolytes. More importantly, protons are the major charge-carriers 

which  moves  across  the  membrane,  particularly  for  the  cation- 
exchange  membranes,  during  charge  and  discharge  processes  to 
achieve charge balance between the electrolytes and also to com- 
plete the electrical circuit in the cell [54 , 285 , 295 , 357] . The direc- 
tion of proton ﬂux across a cation-exchange membrane is depen- 
dent on the charge and discharge process, and therefore inﬂuences 
the volume of anolyte and catholyte of the VRFB. In more detail, 
protons as major charge-carrying species move from the negative 
side of VRFBs to the positive side during a discharge process to en- 
sure electroneutrality, but in the reverse direction during charging 
conditions. 

For  cation-exchange  membranes  like  Naﬁon  and  other  sul- 
fonated  membranes,  there  are  two  major  mechanisms,  namely 
Grotthuss and Vehicular, that contribute to proton transport across 
these membranes [61 , 358] . Grotthuss mechanism is the dominant 
proton transport mechanism and it involves the transport of pro- 
tons at the center of membrane pores resulting from the hydrogen 
bond network of water molecules in the channels of the membrane 
[61] . The vehicular mechanism, on the other hand, refers to proton 
transport by correlated ion-pair motion, which allows the trans- 
port of protons along the sidewalls of the membrane pores. Conse- 
quently, the proton conductivity of membranes can be greatly en- 
hanced by increasing the pore sizes of membrane. However, such 
a design may also result in high vanadium-ion permeability and 
water transport which in turn leads to poor battery performance. 

In summary, as proton transport is signiﬁcant in tandem with 
water  and  vanadium-ion  transport,  it  is  therefore  essential  for 
membranes used in VRFBs to effectively distinguish vanadium ions 
from protons. Generally, the ideal polymer electrolyte membrane 
suitable for VRFB operations should selectively limit vanadium-ion 
permeability while allowing the ease transport of protons. 

6.2. Vanadium-ion transport 

The continuous circulation of electrolytes during the operation 
of VRFBs and the concentration difference of vanadium ions be- 
tween the two half-cells inevitably leads to the transport of vana- 
dium  ions  across  the  membrane  to  the  opposite  compartment, 
even though, it is desirable for this crossover process not to take 
place  [49] .  Vanadium  ions  crossover  consequently  triggers  self- 
discharge, side reactions, and capacity loss. The transport of vana- 
dium ions across polymer electrolyte membranes varies with the 
ionic  exchange  groups  attached  to  the  membrane  [359 , 360] .  For 
instance, a typical cation-exchange membrane readily gives path- 
ways to positively charged ions, primarily because the membrane 
composition contains negatively charged groups, such as -COO −, - 
−. On the other hand, the anion-exchange mem- 
3 H − and -SO 
PO 
3 
+ and - 
+ , -SR 
branes contain positively charged groups, like -NH 
2 
3 
+ , in their matrix and therefore allow the transport of anions 
NRH 
2 
while restricting the transport of cations [360] . Asides the attached 
groups on the membrane, the morphology and structure of poly- 
mer electrolyte membranes also inﬂuence the transport of metal 
cations  [361] .  In  this  section,  vanadium-ion  crossover  in  cation- 
exchange membranes and porous membranes are discussed. Gen- 
erally,  the  various  mechanisms  that  contribute  the  transport  of 
vanadium ions through membranes are diffusion, migration, and 
convection. These transport mechanisms are inﬂuenced and deter- 
mined by different factors. Diffusion mechanism is majorly deter- 
mined by the concentration gradient of vanadium ions; migration 
mechanism is largely inﬂuenced by the potential gradient of elec- 
trolytes; and convection is primarily driven by pressure gradient of 
the electrolytes [49 , 362] . 

To investigate the processes and effects of vanadium-ion trans- 
port  mechanisms  in  cation-exchange  membranes,  as  well  as  the 
dominant  mechanisms  in  VRFBs  under  various  operating  condi- 
tions, several computational and numerical studies have been car-

ried out. Knehr et al. [363] developed a model to investigate the 
transport of vanadium ions through the membrane used in a VRFB. 
The  three  aforementioned  transport  mechanisms  were  all  taken 
into  consideration  in  the  study.  It  was  pointed  out  that,  diffu- 
sion, convection and migration inﬂuence the rate and direction of 
vanadium-ion transport across the membrane during charging and 
discharging processes based on the operating conditions of the nu- 
merical study. The study further shows that the net vanadium-ion 
transport  occurs  from  the  positive  to  the  negative  half-cell  dur- 
ing charging process and then reversed during discharging process. 
In another study, the inﬂuence of different membrane thicknesses 
on these transport mechanisms were later numerically investigated 
[364] .  Their  results  showed  that  the  membranes  with  a  thinner 
thickness present a higher crossover ﬂux indicating that the ease 
of vanadium ions transport through membranes is closely related 
to the thickness of the membrane as shown in Fig. 17 (a). Asides 
membrane thickness, the degradation of membrane also enhances 
the crossover of vanadium ions through the membrane. 

To  compare  the  transport  mechanisms  in  different  types  of 
cation-exchange membrane, Naﬁon 117 and sulfonated Radel mem- 
branes were studied using numerical model [365] . The results in- 
dicated that vanadium-ion transport through Naﬁon 117 was pre- 
dominated  by  diffusion.  While  vanadium-ion  transport  through 
sulfonated Radel membrane was reported to be mostly dominated 
by convection as a result of low vanadium-ion permeability and 
high ionic conductivity of the membrane. The study also showed 
that, in the s-Radel membrane, the direction of convection changes 
during the charging and discharging process, while it maintained 
the same direction in Naﬁon membranes. This therefore shows that 
the transport processes of vanadium ions in different membranes 
may not be generally the same. 

Other  than  the  cation-exchange  membranes,  Zhou  et  al. 
[366] also developed a numerical model to investigate the three 
transport mechanisms of vanadium ions through a porous mem- 
brane made of pore size of about 45 nm. Operation parameters in- 
cluding the electrolyte ﬂow rate showed a great inﬂuence on the 
crossover rate through the porous membrane. After the numerical 
analysis, transport of vanadium ions by convection was discovered 

as the dominant transport mechanism in the porous membrane. 
In addition, their results further indicated vanadium-ion crossover 
via convection can be reduced if the pore size of the membrane 
is below 15 nm, while the vanadium ion crossover resulting from 
diffusion and migration modes can be reduced if the pore size is 
about 2 nm. 

In  summary,  the  direction  of  vanadium  species  crossover 
through membrane due to diffusion is the same during both charg- 
ing  and  discharging  processes  while  the  direction  of  migration 
changes, [367] as shown in Fig. 17 (b). For different operating con- 
ditions and membranes, it is also important to take all these mech- 
anisms into consideration when analyzing the contribution of each 
mechanism to the transport of vanadium ions as they may not al- 
ways be the same. 

6.3. Water transport 

The  transfer  of  water  through  the  polymer  electrolyte  mem- 
brane  is  of  vital  importance  as  it  greatly  inﬂuences  electrolyte 
volume  change  and  the  overall  performance  of  ﬂow  batteries. 
Water  crossover  may  lead  to  imbalance  between  the  volume 
of  electrolytes,  thereby  resulting  in  the  dilution/ﬂooding  of  one 
electrolyte  and  at  the  same  time  leading  to  more  concentra- 
tion/precipitation  of  the  other  electrolyte  solution  [4 9,36 8–371] . 
Apparently, this usually result in the capacity loss as well as op- 
erational diﬃculties in ﬂow battery systems. 

In  VRFBs,  water  is  produced  in  the  positive  side  during  dis- 
charge while consumed during charge. Skyllas-Kazacos and her re- 
search team [368] for the ﬁrst time investigated water transport in 
VRFBs after an unequal level of electrolytes in the two half-cells 
were observed in their previous studies [295 , 372] . Various mech- 
anisms were reported to be responsible for water transport across 
the membrane. First, the diffusion of water (bound water) along 
with the crossover of electroactive species. Water molecules have 
been reported to accompany vanadium ions as the later transport 
through the membrane during the charge and discharge operations 
of a VRFB [370] . Second is water concentration difference between 
the two half-cells [373] . Third, water transfer across membrane by

electro-osmotic drag. This is the water dragged alongside proton 
transport  through  the  membrane  as  the  protons  move  to  main- 
tain electroneutrality and complete the internal electric circuit in 
the  cell  [371,374] .  Water  transport  by  electro-osmotic  drag  from 
proton ﬂux has been reported to transfer more volume of water 
across the membrane in comparison to vanadium ions crossover 
[374] . Water transport through the membrane also occurs via os- 
mosis. This is as a result of the osmotic pressure gradients between 
the two half-cells, which could exist due to the difference in the 
viscosity  of  the  catholyte  and  anolyte  [373] .  In  a  VRFB,  the  vis- 
cosity of the catholyte is usually greater than the anolyte which 
leads to pressure gradient across the membrane [375] . This there- 
fore underlines the convective water transport towards the nega- 
tive half-cells in cation-exchange membranes, irrespective of charg- 
ing or discharging condition. Generally, electro-osmosis water drag 
via proton ﬂux and diffusion of water are considered to predom- 
inantly inﬂuence electrolyte imbalance as they both majorly con- 
tribute to electrolyte volume change, and in turn inﬂuence concen- 
tration difference of electrolytes on both sides of VRFBs. However, 
Jeong and Jung [373] mentioned that, if equal number of protons 
move across the membrane during a cycling process, the electroos- 
motic drag would not contribute to electrolytes imbalance. 

Generally,  the  rate  and  direction  of  water  transport  are  de- 
termined by the nature and properties of membranes, electrolyte 
compositions, and SOC. Hence, when a cation-exchange membrane 
is employed in VRFBs, a signiﬁcant volume of water moves from 
the negative half-cell to the positive half-cell during the battery 
operations, which is attributed to the large volume of water (hy- 
dration water) that accompanies V 2 + and V 3 + transport from the 
negative side. However, water transport occurs in the reverse di- 
rection when an anion exchange membrane is used [61,376] . As for 
the SOC, Sukkar and Skyllas-Kazacos [370] investigated the effects 
of SOC on water transport in cation-exchange membranes. Their 
results  indicated  that  from  SOC-100  to  SOC-0,  water  moves  to- 
wards the positive half-cell at ﬁrst and then reverses the direction 
at about SOC-50 and then maintains the new direction till SOC- 
0. The study further revealed that at high SOCs, the rate of water 
crossover has negligible effect on the system operations while it 
becomes signiﬁcant when the battery reaches over-discharge state. 
In  order  to  further  understand  the  contribution  of  different 
mechanisms  of  water  transport  in  a  cation-exchange  membrane 
employed in a VRFB, a model on water transport was recently de- 
veloped  [369] .  The  model  thoroughly  considered  the  water  pro- 
duced during the redox reactions at the positive electrode, the side 
reactions  and  three  water  transfer  mechanisms  namely  electro- 
osmotic drag (EOD), water diffusion, and vanadium-ion crossover 
with bound water. The illustration and contributions of these wa- 
ter transfer mechanisms are shown in Fig. 18 (a). Speciﬁcally, the 
contribution of the different mechanisms of water transport when 
the  battery  is  operated  at  a  current  density  of  60  mA  cm −2 ,  is 

shown in Fig. 18 (b) and (c). It was further concluded that when 
the  battery  is  operated  at  a  low  current  density  or  after  longer 
charge-discharge duration, the difference between the anolyte and 
catholyte volumes signiﬁcantly increases. A more recent numeri- 
cal analysis on water transport revealed that electro-osmosis wa- 
ter drag via proton ﬂux and diffusion have the major inﬂuence on 
water transport across cation-exchange membranes [373] . Electro- 
osmosis  water  drag  by  protons  was  further  predicted  and  pre- 
sented as the dominant water transport mechanism due to the fact 
that the direction of the water ﬂux resulting from electro-osmosis 
water drag via proton is the same as the direction of ionic current 
through the membrane. 

In summary, various factors are responsible for water crossover 
through the membranes employed in VRFBs. For different polymer 
electrolyte membranes and working conditions, the dominant wa- 
ter transport mechanism may change. Even though water transport 
across the membrane could be associated with some challenges in- 
cluding capacity degradation, it is worth noting that the complete 
prevention of water crossover might not be practicably achievable. 
The reason is that, for polymer electrolyte membranes especially 
cation-exchange  membranes,  the  transport  of  protons  is  always 
accompanied  by  water  transport.  As  such,  the  complete  preven- 
tion of water transport will consequently hinder the ﬂow of pro- 
tons across the membrane and result in high internal resistance 
in the battery system. Therefore, it is of vital importance for the 
membrane to ensure an optimized water transport ability so as to 
achieve an appropriate balance between proton conductivity and 
low vanadium-ion permeability. 

7. Performance-enhancing strategies for membranes 

A  number  of  strategies  have  been  developed  and  applied  to 
enhance the performance of membranes towards achieving signif- 
icant performance improvement in ﬂow batteries. Irrespective of 
the membrane preparation method or materials, there are various 
enhancement strategies that can be applied to improve the per- 
formance  of  both  membrane  and  battery.  Some  of  these  strate- 
gies include adjusting the DS [200,204] , blending/compositing with 
other  polymers  [174,233] ,  and  tuning  pore  structural  parameters 
[285,295,377] .  Thus,  this  section  brieﬂy  discusses  some  of  these 
performance-enhancing strategies that have shown signiﬁcant im- 
provement on the cycle stability, self-discharge rate and voltage, 
coulombic and energy eﬃciencies of ﬂow batteries. 

7.1. Adjusting sulfonation degree 

Degree of sulfonation (DS) indicates the amount of sulfonic acid 
groups contained in a membrane. Hence, this is closely related to 
the IEC of the membrane and therefore plays a key role in inﬂu- 
encing the ionic conductivity of the membrane. DS can be adjusted 
by  using  methods  such  as  varying  the  time  and  temperature  of 

26 

X. Shi, O.C. Esan, X. Huo et al. 

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 85 (2021) 100926 

the reaction during membrane preparation so as to obtain a de- 
sired DS and associated membrane properties [52] . Many studies 
have attempted to adjust the DS of various materials during mem- 
brane preparation process towards improving the membrane per- 
formance [200,220] . 

SPEEK, as one of the most widely utilized materials for cation- 
exchange  membranes  preparation  have  been  deeply  investigated 
regarding the inﬂuence of DS on the properties of the SPEEK-based 
membranes. The investigation revealed that the increment of DS 
of  the  SPEEK  increases  its  proton  conductivity,  water  uptake  ra- 
tio and IEC [203] . However, it also leads to increase in vanadium- 
ion  crossover  and  subsequently  reduces  the  mechanical  strength 
of  the  membrane.  Other  than  the  SPEEK,  the  effects  of  DS  on 
the ﬂuorene-containing poly(arylene ether sulfone)s have also been 
evaluated [72] . It was found that, similar to the SPEEK membranes, 
the resulting membranes with high DS also showed improved pro- 
ton conductivity and low mechanical strength. 

It should be noted that the inﬂuence of DS on different poly- 
mers may not always be the same. For example, research on the 
SPI and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) blending membrane revealed that, 
while the increase of DS provides the membrane with high pro- 
ton conductivity and crossover rate of vanadium ions, unlike SPEEK 
membranes, its mechanical strength was found to increase, due to 
the  improved  dispersion  of  SPI  in  the  blend  membranes,  which 
therefore  results  in  a  less  stress  convergence  during  mechanical 
property  test  [209] .  Therefore,  for  speciﬁc  membrane  composi- 
tions, the optimized DS needs to be speciﬁcally analyzed accord- 
ing to different application requirements. These results proved that 
adjusting  the  DS  of  membrane  is  an  effective  method  that  has 
great  inﬂuence  on  the  ion  conductivity,  crossover  rate,  and  me- 
chanical properties of membranes. However, for different materi- 
als,  the  effects  of  DS  are  not  necessarily  the  same.  Generally,  a 
high DS would increase the proton conductivity and vanadium ions 
crossover of a membrane. 

7.2. Blending/compositing with other polymers 

Blending/compositing with other polymers is another important 
method that is widely used for enhancing the performance of poly- 
mer electrolyte membrane [240,253] . Various polymers have been 
composited with other polymers to obtain different membranes in- 
cluding cation-exchange, anion-exchange, amphoteric-ion exchange 
and porous membranes [265,319,321] . Through compositing vari- 
ous polymers during the preparation process, the merits of differ- 
ent polymers can be combined while the drawbacks could be com- 
pensated for each other and therefore form a polymer electrolyte 
membrane that is more suitable for ﬂow batteries. 

For example, the introduction of hydrophobic PVDF into SPEEK 
membrane was reported to restraint the swelling nature of pristine 
SPEEK [174] . The obtained SPEEK/PVDF composite membrane was 
found to exhibit a much lower ion permeability than Naﬁon 117 
and achieved a better cell performance with reduced self-discharge 
rate. Other than PVDF, the combination of PAN and SPEEK has also 
been  investigated,  where  the  properties  of  the  composite  mem- 
brane with varied mass ratios are shown in Table 2 [85] . The wa- 
ter uptake ratio and vanadium-ion permeability of the membrane 
were effectively reduced as a result of the hydrogen bonding be- 
tween SPEEK and PAN and the acid-base interaction of ionic cross- 
linking. Compared to Naﬁon 117, this composite membrane ﬁnally 
provides the battery with improved coulombic and energy eﬃcien- 
cies. 

Beyond  using  only  two  types  of  polymer  during  membrane 
preparation, the combination of more polymers has also been stud- 
ied and proven as an effective method. For instance, Wang et al. 
[226]  deposited  the  positively  charged  polyelectrolyte  PDDA  and 
negatively charged PSS on SPFEK membrane layer-by-layer fabri- 

cate a PDDA/PSS-SPFEK composite membrane. With the introduc- 
tion of the PDDA/PSS bilayer, the chemical stability of the mem- 
brane  was  greatly  improved,  and  its  vanadium-ion  permeability 
was also reduced, compared to the pristine SPFEK membrane. 

Other than cation-exchange membranes, compositing different 
polymers is also considered as an effective method for the perfor- 
mance  improvement  of  other  types  of  membranes.  For  instance, 
a  series  of  anion-exchange  membranes  was  prepared  by  pore- 
ﬁlling the PE substrate with poly(4-vinylbenzyl chloride) followed 
by amination with pyridyl functional groups [285] . It is found that, 
with  the  increasing  content  of  divinylbenzene  in  this  composite 
membrane, the cross-linking between polymers increased, which 
further  lead  to  a  more  dense  membrane  structure  and  thereby 
preventing the crossover of vanadium ions. The optimized mem- 
brane  ﬁnally  possessed  an  improved  conductivity  with  a  lower 
vanadium-ion permeability compared to Naﬁon 117. The VRFBs as- 
sembled  with  the  obtained  membranes  presented  a  5.4%  higher 
energy eﬃciency than the ones assembled with Naﬁon 117. 

With  these  results,  blending/compositing  different  polymers 
is  hence  proved  to  be  an  effective  method  for  preparing  high- 
performance membrane. However, it is important to carefully ad- 
just the content ratio between the different polymers so as to en- 
sure that the membrane achieve adequate balance among proper- 
ties for better performance. 

7.3. Tuning pore structural parameters 

The pore structures of polymer electrolyte membranes such as 
pore size and porosity have been proven to greatly inﬂuence the 
transport of species within the membrane [342] . Membranes with 
large pore sizes would ease species transport and further provide 
the  batteries  with  low  internal  resistance  and  high  voltage  eﬃ- 
ciency. However, membranes with a large pore size may also re- 
sult in severe crossover of vanadium ions which in turn reduce the 
capacity retention ability of the battery. Therefore, tuning the pore 
sizes of membranes to appropriate dimension can greatly inﬂuence 
the performance of the membranes and ﬂow batteries. Especially 
for the porous membranes, the pore sizes are considered to be one 
of the most important parameters that can be tuned to improve 
their performance [322,325] . 

Many methods have been proposed for tuning pore structure. 
One of the pore adjustment strategies is through blending differ- 
ent polymers. Chen et al. [342] combined the SPEEK with PES to 
fabricate a series of symmetric spongy porous membranes. It was 
found  that,  with  the  increment  of  SPEEK  content,  the  pore  size 
of this composite membrane can be enlarged, thereby validating 
that  the  content  ratio  between  different  polymers  in  a  compos- 
ite  membrane  has  signiﬁcant  effect  on  the  adjustment  of  mem- 
brane pore structure. Overall, by adjusting the pore structure, the 
obtained optimal membrane with 13% of SPEEK successfully pro- 
vide the battery with stable cell performance for more than 200 
cycles.  Another  successful  demonstration  for  pore  structure  con- 
trol  was  achieved  by  Peng  et  al.  [378]  by  introducing  an  ultra- 
thin  defect  free  skin  layer  onto  the  surface  of  PBI-based  porous 
membranes.  In  their  study,  the  adjustment  of  the  porosity  and 
pore  size  was  achieved  by  varying  the  porogen  content,  while 
it  was  found  that,  with  the  porogen  content  increased  to  200 
wt.%, the membrane achieved the best balanced performance with 
a  coulombic  eﬃciency  of  99%  and  an  energy  eﬃciency  of  82.3% 
at  80  mA  cm −2 .  However,  it  was  also  found  that,  over  increas- 
ing the porogen content has a negative effect on the capacity re- 
tention  ability  of  the  membrane,  as  shown  by  the  cycle  perfor- 
mance test conducted. Hence, it has been proven that the mem- 
brane pore structure has notable impact on the membrane perfor- 
mance. Thus, the pore structure and sizes of membrane are of vital 
importance towards determining membrane performance, as well

as  an  effective  strategy  for  membrane  and  battery  performance 
improvement. 

7.4. Tuning geometric parameters and designs 

The performance of polymer electrolyte membranes can be sig- 
niﬁcantly enhanced by tuning the geometric parameters and de- 
signs of the membranes. A lot of studies have shown that the ge- 
ometric parameters of membranes such as the thickness have sev- 
eral impacts on the membrane properties such as membrane resis- 
tance and mechanical strength, and are therefore considered to be 
one of the most effective methods for performance improvement 
[84,379] . 

Membrane thickness is an important geometric parameter that 
has  signiﬁcant  inﬂuence  on  the  performance  of  both  membrane 
and  battery.  The  effect  of  the  thickness  of  SPEEK  membranes 
on  the  performance  has  been  deeply  investigated  by  a  series  of 
SPEEK membranes with thickness ranging from 30-150 μm [380] . 
The  results  showed  that  the  thickness  of  membrane  largely  in- 
ﬂuences  the  charge  and  discharge  voltage  proﬁle  of  the  battery, 
as membrane thickness is one of the parameters that determine 
the  ohmic  resistance  of  the  membrane.  In  the  meanwhile,  with 
the increase of membrane thickness, the vanadium ions crossover 
rate  is  found  to  decrease,  while,  the  thicker  membrane  would 
result  in  a  large  resistance,  and  thereby  lead  to  low  voltage 
eﬃciency. 

Other  than  the  membrane  thickness,  tuning  the  membrane 
structure design is another effective method for performance im- 
provement. A novel sandwich-structure membrane proposed by Yu 
et al. has proven this idea [194] . Utilizing the hydrophilic porous 
PTFE  and  SPEEK,  a  novel  PTFE/SPEEK/PTFE  membrane  was  fabri- 
cated.  With  the  introduction  of  PTFE  layer  on  both  sides  of  the 
SPEEK  membrane,  the  external  damages  from  electrolytes,  elec- 
trodes  and  sealing  materials  were  successfully  prevented  which 
hence  provides  the  membrane  with  better  chemical  stability.  It 
was  found  that,  with  this  novel  design,  the  membrane  with  an 
appropriate thickness of PTFE presented an excellent capacity re- 
tention ability after running for more than 10 0 0 cycles as shown 
in Fig. 19 . Hence, tuning the geometric parameters and designs of 
membranes are typical effective methods that can improve the per- 
formance of membranes. However, it is worth to emphasize that 
for different membrane compositions and designs, the required op- 
timal thickness is not necessarily the same and should be adjusted 
individually. 

7.5. Adding inorganic materials 

Similar  to  blending/compositing  with  other  polymers  during 
membrane preparation process, adding inorganic materials is an- 

other effective and widely-used method that improves the mem- 
brane performance [98,325] . It has been proven in direct methanol 
fuel  cells  that  the  incorporation  of  inorganic  materials  to  mem- 
branes can help alleviates methanol crossover [54] . Hence, in an 
attempt to restrict the vanadium ions permeation effectively, re- 
searchers have followed this idea and developed membranes for 
VRFBs through adding various inorganic materials. 

Carbon-based inorganic materials have been widely employed 
for  membrane  preparation.  In  section  5 ,  the  involvement  of  GO, 
which  is  a  famous  material  with  special  two-dimensional  lay- 
ered  structure  has  been  extensively  discussed  as  an  additive  in 
the  fabrication  of  various  composite  membranes  with  improved 
performances  [210] .  In  addition  to  that,  nano  carbon-based  ma- 
terials have also been used for membrane fabrication. The short- 
carboxylic  multi-walled  carbon  nanotube  (SCCT)  is  an  inorganic 
material  which  exhibited  excellent  electrochemical  activity  and 
durability.  It  has  been  successfully  embedded  into  SPEEK  ma- 
trix  to  fabricate  the  SPEEK/SCCT  membrane  [198] .  The  introduc- 
tion of SCCT offers the composite membrane with a high electro- 
catalytic activity, which in comparison to Naﬁon 212 also exhibited 
higher mechanical strength and lower vanadium-ion permeability, 
as shown in Fig. 20 .

2 , and TiO 

Other than carbon-based materials, different types of nano ox- 
ides have also been used as additive for membrane preparation. 
2 175 into the SPEEK is an 
The introduction of Al 
example. It was found that the introduction of these inorganic par- 
ticles into polymers can improve the mechanical property of the 
membrane  while  suppressing  the  crossover  of  vanadium  ions  as 
the inorganic particles could serve as barrier. The battery test re- 
sults showed that in comparison to Naﬁon 117, the fabricated com- 
posite membrane exhibited a much better cycle stability. 

In summary, adding inorganic particles into other polymers for 
membrane  preparation  could  therefore  be  regarded  as  an  effec- 
tive performance-enhancing technique. It is also worth to note that 
the concentration of these inorganic particles inside the membrane 
may be an important factor that could inﬂuence the overall mem- 
brane performance. 

8. Cost and commercialization 

High  capital  cost  is  one  of  the  crucial  factors  hampering  the 
wide application of ﬂow batteries [141,175,255] . To realize the ac- 
tual application of ﬂow batteries, several cost analysis have been 
carried on their structural components so as to identify and reduce 
the  major  sources  of  the  high  cost.  In  the  meanwhile,  attracted 
by the impressive performance of ﬂow battery technology, some 
large-scale commercial systems have been constructed and devel- 
oped to validate their practicality [381,382] . 

28 

X. Shi, O.C. Esan, X. Huo et al. 

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 85 (2021) 100926 

for the membrane in these systems takes 44 and 27%, respectively. 
The results indicated that the major cost of the entire ﬂow battery 
system largely depends on the cost of membrane and electrolyte 
preparation. To analyze the cost of an optimized VRFB system, an- 
other model has been developed by Crawford et al. [385] . The re- 
sults showed that the optimized system is estimated to have a sys- 
tem cost < $ 350 kWh −1  for 4-h application. While, it was also 
suggested that the cost could be reduced to 160 kWh −1 when the 
production scale becomes larger. Furthermore, the costs of differ- 
ent types of ﬂow battery system have also been compared in order 
to identify the optimal ﬂow battery suitable for commercialization. 
Zeng et al. [51] investigated the application of large-scale electrical 
energy storage using VRFB and iron-chromium RFB and also ana- 
lyzed the capital cost of both ﬂow batteries. It was revealed that 
for a 1 MW-8h system,  the capital cost of a VRFB is $ 229 kW 
h −1 , while an iron-chromium RFB goes for $ 194 kW h −1 . Accord- 
ing to their study, one of the major contributors to the high cost 
of VRFB is the electrolyte as it accounts for about 53% of the total 
cost while the membrane takes almost 20% of the total cost. Dif- 
ferent from VRFBs, the component with the highest cost in iron- 
chromium RFB is the membrane as it takes 38% of the total cost 
while that of the electrolyte is 9%. Thus, while the electrolyte cost 
varies a lot for different ﬂow battery systems, the cost of mem- 
brane is always high and requires substantial reduction. 

With the cost analysis of ﬂow battery system, the cost of the 
membranes and the electrolyte are identiﬁed as the most impor- 
tant factors that hinder wide application of ﬂow batteries. It is be- 
lieved that, reduction in the cost of membranes will accelerate the 
wide application of ﬂow battery systems. 

8.2. Commercialization 

8.2.1. Membrane level 

The  polymer  electrolyte  membranes  that  are  commercially 
available  and  commonly  employed  in  ﬂow  battery  systems  are 
still very limited. The most widely used commercial polymer elec- 
trolyte membranes come from the Dupont including the Perﬂuori- 
nated Naﬁon series (e.g., Naﬁon 115, Naﬁon 117, Naﬁon 211, Naﬁon 
212 etc.). These membranes possess adequate stability and provide 
ﬂow batteries with satisfactory performance. However, the Naﬁon 
membranes are very expensive and possess low selectivity of pro- 
tons  to  other  ions  which  therefore  limit  their  wide  application. 
To compensate for this, various methods have been employed for 
membrane modiﬁcation to enhance their electrochemical proper- 
ties. Notwithstanding, a reduced cost of Naﬁon membrane materi- 
als coupled with improved transport properties would go a long 
way  in  the  market  widespread  of  VRFB.  Other  than  the  Naﬁon 
membranes, another type of commercial membrane named VANA- 
Dion, has also been used in ﬂow batteries and shows compelling 
performance. The VANADion membrane is made of a micro-porous 
layer together with a thin Naﬁon layer. VANADion 20 and VANA- 
Dion 20L are the two available types of VANADion membranes on 
Naﬁonstore Ion Power Naﬁon TM Store website [381 , 382] . In addi- 
tion to these cation exchange membranes, some of the common 
commerical  anion-exchange  membranes  developed  by  Fusemap 
have also been summarised and compared as shown in Table 3 . 

8.2.2. Battery level 

In 1993, the ﬁrst VRFB system developed by the University of 
New South Wales, conducted its ﬁrst ﬁeld trial in a Solar House in 
Thailand and since then more and more effort s have been put into 
the commercialization of this particular ﬂow battery to further val- 
idate and improve their practical applications [387] . Later, in 1996, 
a 20 0 kW/80 0 kWh VRFB system was installed by Mitsubishi Cor- 
poration  for  load-leveling  at  Kashima-Kita  Electric  Power  [6] .  In

8.1. Cost 

The high initial cost of ﬂow battery is one of the major con- 
cerns holding back its widespread commercialization. The cost of 
ﬂow battery system is closely related to the set-up of the system, 
which is determined by the requirement of the power and storage 
capacity. In 2004, Joerissen et al. [383] comprehensively analyzed 
the cost of a VRFB as an electrical energy storage system based on 
lab-scale cell experiments. Results from the analysis showed that 
for a  2  kW/30 kWh  system,  the cost  of  VRFB is  expected  to  be 
slightly lower than € 30 0 0 0. Their results also indicated that the 
cost of a VRFB system is very sensitive to the market price of V 
2 O 
5 
such that a reduction in price of V 
5  is expected to reduce the 
cost of VRFB. 

2 O 

In order to further analyze the relationship between the perfor- 
mance and cost of ﬂow battery, Viswanathan et al. [384] later de- 
veloped a cost and performance model for ﬂow battery. The model 
has been used to regulate the operating parameters of the battery 
system  in  order  to  maximize  the  eﬃciency  of  the  system  while 
minimizing the capital cost. Considering VRFB, the model results 
showed that the battery using the sulfuric acid-based electrolyte 
incurs a higher cost than the system using mixed acid-based elec- 
trolyte. For VRFB system using mixed acid electrolyte, the cost of 
5 takes 8 and 43% of the total cost, for the system with an en- 
V 
ergy size of 0.25 MWh and 4 MWh, respectively. While the cost

2005, another 4 WM/6 MWh VRFB system was installed at Sub- 
aru  Wind  Farm  for  electrical  energy  storage  by  Sumitomo  Elec- 
tric  Industries  [388] .  Following  these  successful  installations and 
commercial applications, more and more large-scale VRFB systems 
have been installed at various locations across the globe including 
Japan, Europe and the U.S.A. Some of these installations are sum- 
marized in Table 4 . 

9. Remaining challenges and perspectives 

Flow batteries, with their independently tunable power and en- 
ergy storage capacity, are considered as one of the most promis- 
ing electrochemical systems for large-scale electrical energy stor- 
age. Coupled with their compelling features and advantages, they 
have therefore increasingly attracted global attention. However, the 
unsatisfactory performance and high capital cost of polymer elec- 
trolyte membrane, one of the major components in ﬂow batteries, 
remain a major concern towards achieving the wide application of 
ﬂow battery systems. This therefore justiﬁes the need for further 
studies on performance improvement as well as cost effectiveness 
of membranes, especially under high charge/discharge current den- 
sities and extreme operating conditions. 

The Naﬁon membranes, as the most widely used commercial 
membrane, possess a number of advantages and have therefore at- 
tracted several applications in large-scale systems. However, their 
wide applications still suffer from high crossover rate of electroac- 
tive species in addition to its high cost. Though much efforts have 
been made to design and prepare more polymer electrolyte mem- 
branes suitable for ﬂow batteries to achieve improved battery per- 
formance;  without  doubt,  some  challenges  still  remain.  The  re- 
quirements  for  an  ideal  polymer  electrolyte  membrane  for  all- 
vanadium redox ﬂow batteries can be summarized as follows: i) it 
should possess an optimal balance between ionic conductivity and 
vanadium-ion permeability to achieve high-power density and ex- 
cellent cycle retention ability; ii) it should possess adequate chem- 
ical, mechanical, and thermal stabilities to withstand extreme as- 
sembling and operating conditions; and iii) it should be affordable 
so as to fulﬁll the needs for large-scale application and usage. 

Although  different  types  of  membrane  have  been  developed 
over the years, yet, it is still somewhat diﬃcult to obtain a mem- 
brane that can fulﬁll all the aforementioned requirements. In other 
words, the ideal performance of the available membranes is be- 
ing limited by various challenges. For instance, the major challenge 
of cation-exchange membranes is high vanadium-ions permeabil-

ity  which  has  negative  impacts  on  the  capacity  retention  ability 
of battery system. For anion-exchange membranes, the prominent 
challenge has been its poor ionic conductivity, which greatly re- 
stricts the voltage eﬃciency of the battery. Though amphoteric-ion 
exchange membrane has a great prospect to achieve effective ions 
selectivity, however, its complicated fabrication method and poor 

accuracy of adjusting the concentrations of anion-exchange groups 
and  cation-exchange  groups  mostly  hinder  the  potential  perfor- 
mance of this particular membrane. Similarly, challenges on how to 
accurately adjust pore size while ensuring a hydrophilic pore struc- 
ture, so as to ease proton transport, confronts the porous mem- 
branes.

To  address  and  overcome  many  of  these  challenges  towards 
obtaining ideal polymer electrolyte membranes for ﬂow batteries, 
some  directions  for  further  investigations  are  given  here.  Firstly, 
the  development  and  widespread  application  of  more  porous 
membranes  is  a  viable  solution.  Here,  the  pore  structure  of  the 
membrane such as the pore size and porosity need to be carefully 
adjusted. For instance, the pore size of the membrane is often re- 
quired to be adjusted within a range larger than the molecular size 
of protons while at the same time smaller than the vanadium ions 
inside the electrolyte. With this design, the ease of proton trans- 
port through the membrane can be assured while remarkably re- 
stricting the transport of vanadium ions. However, it is worth men- 
tioning that tuning the pore size to this range may still limit the 
battery performance to certain level, especially as tuning can po- 
tentially limit the ionic conductivity of the membrane. The intro- 
duction of charged groups into the pores of the porous membrane 
could  be  a  potential  solution.  However,  the  amount  to  be  used 
needs to be carefully controlled so as to minimize its impact on 
vanadium-ion permeability. 

For  the  ion  exchange  membranes  including  cation-exchange 
membranes, anion-exchange membranes, and amphoteric-ion ex- 
change membranes, major strategies for performance improvement 
should include further modiﬁcations of membranes using currently 
reported  materials,  especially  the  ones  with  compelling  proper- 
ties. In addition to this, development of other novel materials with 
backbone of excellent chemical stability and simultaneous conduc- 
tivity for cations or anions. In summary, further development and 
study  on  polymer  electrolyte  membranes  should  concentrate  on 
but not limited to: i) the development of ion-exchange membranes 
with excellent balance between ionic conductivity and vanadium- 
ion  permeability  through  tuning  the  material  composition,  im- 
proving the preparation procedures, optimizing membrane thick- 
ness and pore size distribution; and ii) the development of porous 
membranes  with  appropriate  pore  structure.  In  addition,  further 
studies and investigations on polymer electrolyte membranes suit- 
able for other types of ﬂow battery systems such as hybrid, organic 
and semi solid ﬂow batteries should be exploited and developed. 
With the recognition of the various challenges confronting the per- 
formance of polymer electrolyte membranes, the promising direc- 
tions highlighted above are considered useful to facilitate further 
investigations for performance improvement, even at low cost, to 
achieve widespread applications of these membranes in ﬂow bat- 
teries.
