Fuel cell and hydrogen technologies are re-gaining momentum in a number of sectors including industrial,
tertiary and residential ones. Integrated biogas fuel cell plants in wastewater treatment plants and other
bioenergy recovery plants are nowadays on the verge of becoming a clear opportunity for the market entry
of high-temperature fuel cells in distributed generation (power production from a few kW to the MW scale).
High-temperature fuel cell technologies like molten carbonate fuel cells (MCFCs) and solid oxide fuel
cells (SOFCs) are especially fit to operate with carbon fuels due to their (direct or indirect) internal reform-
ing capability. Especially, systems based on SOFC technology show the highest conversion efficiency of gas-
eous carbon fuels (e.g., natural gas, digester gas, and biomass-derived syngas) into electricity when
compared to engines or gas turbines. Also, lower CO2 emissions and ultra-low emissions of atmospheric
contaminants (SOX, CO, VOC, especially NOX) are generated per unit of electricity output. Nonetheless, strin-
gent requirements apply regarding fuel purity. The presence of contaminants within the anode fuel stream,
even at trace levels (sometimes ppb levels) can reduce the lifetime of key components like the fuel cell stack
and reformer. In this work, we review the complex matrix (typology and amount) of different contaminants
that is found in different biogas types (anaerobic digestion gas and landfill gas). We analyze the impact of
contaminants on the fuel reformer and the SOFC stack to identify the threshold limits of the fuel cell system
towards specific contaminants. Finally, technological solutions and related adsorbent materials to remove
contaminants in a dedicated clean-up unit upstream of the fuel cell plant are also reviewed.

1. Overview of this work

1.1. Scope and motivation

PIntegrated biogas fuel cell systems in wastewater treatment
plants and other bioenergy recovery plants are now on the verge of
becoming a clear opportunity for the entry of high-temperature fuel
cells in the stationary market. In this work, the focus is restricted to
SOFC technology. MCFC technology shares much of the same auxil-
iary infrastructures (regarding the Balance-of-Plant) and protocols
of operation with the SOFC; hence, degradation issues are similar to
those of the SOFC when it comes to reformer and anode contamina-
tion from fuel impurities. In fact, both SOFC and MCFC have the capa-
bility of direct internal reforming of carbon fuels [1]. Also, threshold
limits for contaminants in fuel cell quality feeds and clean-up design
recommendations reported in this work are equally useful and
extendable to natural gas, and syngas from biomass gasification.

POne of the barriers for the deployment of CHP fuel cell systems
comes from the degradation of the fuel cell stack. This technical bar-
rier has direct economic consequences. Higher degradation rates
translate to lower lifetime of the stack, which is a large cost item of
the whole plant installation. Fuel cell performance degradation from
fuel contaminants is detrimental for the whole plant availability, as
altered stack performance limits the operability of the system.

PThis paper attempts to summarize, analyze and discuss in detail
recent findings and advances in the field of SOFCs running on gas-
eous bio-fuels. Especially, the focus is on an SOFC fed by anaerobic
digestion or landfill biogas. There is a great potential to further
increase energy recovery from biogas, and SOFC technology seems a
good match to maximize the efficiency of this use. Dealing with bio-
gas fuel, on the other hand, might add complexity and further degra-
dation to the SOFC and related BoP components (e.g., the fuel
reformer). Therefore, in this study, we analyze the pathway from
raw biogas to the use of clean biogas in the SOFC to understand the

Prisks due to the contaminants, and how to manage and eventually
minimize them.

1.2. Structure of this work

PBriefly, the work is articulated into five main sections:

P- The first one provides an overview of current trends and issues
for biogas use in advanced fuel cell systems as well as the biogas
production potential from different organic substrates;

P- The second one deals with the origin, type and amount of con-

taminants expected in typical biogases;

P- The third section investigates the impact of fuel contaminants

on the Ni-based reformer catalyst;

P- The fourth reports on the impact of fuel contaminants on the
high-temperature fuel cell Ni-anode (the SOFC Ni-anode will be
reviewed in more detail than the MCFC since a significantly
larger literature is available for the SOFC technology);

P- The last section describes biogas purification techniques; meth-
ods and materials for the removal of harmful contaminants
down to ppb-levels, as sometimes required by the fuel cell, are
discussed in detail.

PIn more detail, the paper is organized as follows. First, we
provide an overview of the biogas use and potential in Europe.
The focus is limited to Europe since several
installations are
located in this macro-region and several data were freely avail-
able especially for this area. In fact, most of the biogas potential
is roughly proportional to the number of inhabitants living in a
given area. Therefore, results obtained from Europe could be
extrapolated to some extent to different geographic regions that
share similar features in terms of economic development, diet
patterns, and waste management.

PThe detrimental impact of biogas contaminants on the end-
user device, i.e., the fuel cell, then follows in the paper. Some
fuel contaminants can lead to a fast and irreversible degradation
of catalytic and electro-catalytic active surfaces. The effect of
biogas contaminants on the fuel cell Ni-based reformer and Ni-
anode are thus assessed.

PThis study is mostly limited to the Ni-based reformer and the Ni-
anode SOFC as they represent state-of-the-art materials of commer-
cial and pre-commercial systems and are expected to remain the
dominant design solution for the coming years. The focus is mostly
on the impact of H2S and siloxanes for both the reformer catalyst
and the fuel cell anode since they are known to be the most danger-
ous compounds, as will be corroborated in this study. The effect of
heavier hydrocarbons is also reviewed since enhanced carbon for-
mation rates are observed when co-feeding methane with other
hydrocarbons (e.g., C2, C3 compounds). The fuel cell anode is also
tested against HCl (which is not present in high concentration in bio-
gases, except for landfill biogas; however, HCl, along with H2S, is
abundant in coal syngas [2,3] and we deemed it useful to extend the
study to this chemical species as well). The state-of-the-art MCFC
also has a Ni-based anode electrode (with generally higher Ni con-
tent than the SOFC Ni cermet). Therefore, the MCFC shares essen-
tially the same issues as the SOFC in terms of fuel contamination.
Antolini has recently reviewed the stability of molten carbonate fuel
cell electrodes [4], especially the coking resistance of the MCFC
anode catalyst towards direct internal steam reforming of natural
gas as well as degradation issues caused by alkali poisoning originat-
ing from the molten carbonate electrolyte.

PFinally, we provide an in-depth overview of both scientific and
some engineering aspects connected to the removal of biogas con-
taminants. Given the harmful effects of most of the biogas contami-
nants on the reformer and fuel cell performance, biogas purification
is required. After reviewing various techniques for the contaminants
removal, the focus is on solid sorbents since they can provide a deep
clean-up of the incoming fuel that complies with SOFC fuel quality
requirements. We will show how impregnated activated carbons are
effective for the removal of H2S and siloxanes.

PPrevious reviews on connected topics can be found in the work of
Boudghene Stambouli and Traversa [5], who reviewed SOFC

Pmaterials and components. An in-depth review of scientific and
technological advances in the selection and characterization of SOFC
materials has been provided by Mahato et al. [6]. A review of mathe-
matical and computational methods for modeling solid oxide fuel
cells are outside the scope of this review and can be found elsewhere
[7,8]. For mathematical modelling of the molten carbonate fuel cell,
the interested reader is referred to the work of Brouwer et al. [9] and
Milewski et al. [10].

2. Chapter 1 (cid:1) biogas potential and its use in solid oxide fuel cells
(SOFCs)

2.1. Biogas potential

PThe global biogas potential is estimated to lie around 36,000 PJ
[11], 6.5% of the world total primary energy supply in 2012. Energy
crops would cover more than one-third of the overall potential thus
taking the largest share. The second largest contributor would be
manure collected from animal farming (cid:1) covering about one fourth
of the overall potential.

PIn Table 1, different biogas sources are listed. The European Bio-
mass Association also provides a detailed estimate of the European
biogas potential (Table 2), amounting overall to »66 Mtoe, which
corresponds to an almost five-fold increase with respect to the 2014
production. The overall natural gas consumption in Europe for 2014
was equal to 343 Mtoe. Hence, biogas could substitute a significant
share of fossil gas in the near future.

PIn 2007, the European production of biogas was 248 PJ [13], with
the following provenance: 49% from landfill, 15% from sewage and
36% from other biogases (including among others manure, agricul-
tural residues, and food waste digesters). Seven years later, with an
annual growth of 15%, the biogas primary energy production
increased to 560 PJ [13], more than doubling the 2007 value. In
2013, the overall production was achieved with 13,800 digesters
and around 7.4 GW of electricity generating capacity [13].

PFrom 2007 to 2013, the scene remained unchanged in absolute
numbers concerning landfill biogas production,1 while sewage bio-
gas production from industrial and urban sludge increased by 40%
(see Table 3). A much higher increase occurred for biogas from other
sources (including decentralized agricultural plants, municipal solid
waste methanization plants, and centralized co-digestion plants),
the overall contribution of which rose from 2.1 Mtoe (89 PJ) in 2007
to 9.2 Mtoe (388 PJ) in 2013. This increase was the result of heavily
subsidized biogas production especially in countries like Germany
and Italy, which favored the conditions for the widespread diffusion
of anaerobic digesters treating manure, agricultural residues, dedi-
cated crops, and the organic fraction of municipal solid waste [13].

PIn Table 4, a full accounting of biogas production in the European
zone is given for the period 2006(cid:1)2014 for the three main sources
mentioned above (landfill, sewage, and other biogas). The compari-
son between data taken from the Eur’ Observer database and Euro-

Pfrom the other sources (agricultural residues, MSW and co-digestion
plants where food waste is also processed) was instead responsible
for almost all of the increase in biogas production. Unfortunately,
available statistics do not report a further level of disaggregation for
the item ‘other biogas’.

PFinally, we have also analyzed historical trends of biogas produc-
tion starting from 1990. Notably, there was a more than twenty-fold
increase in biogas production over the last 25 years (see Fig. 2).

PBiogas could account for nearly 7% of the overall primary energy
production in Europe, but most of the potential remains unexploited.
According to the European Biomass Association (AEBIOM), the bio-
gas potential in Europe for 2020 is about 40 Mtoe (»1700 PJ), which
could be further increased to 66 Mtoe once unleashing all the avail-
able resources at full rate [12]. However, it is worth mentioning that
much of this potential comes from energy crops, which accounts for
80% of the total (the assumption is that 5% of arable land is dedicated
to energy crops). Many anaerobic digesters have a mixed diet of
organic waste (e.g., manure) and forage (e.g., maize or sweet sor-
ghum silage) so that it is difficult to have detailed statistics on the
current organic substrates used for biogas production.

POne way to grasp the intrinsic potential of biogas resources is to
look at per head (humans or animals) biogas potential. For instance,
the average citizen in developed countries uses almost 300 liters/day
of water that end up in the sewer [15]. With the total suspended
solid in sewage water of 220 mg/l, roughly 60 g/person/day of
putrescible organic matter (or sludge) are thus collected in the
wastewater plant connected to the sewage system. A realistic meth-
ane yield from sludge is about 200 L of CH4 per kg of dry sludge,
resulting in about 12 L CH4/person/day, or 20 L/person/day of biogas
when assuming that 60 vol.% of biogas is CH4. This biogas production
corresponds to an LHV power of 5 W/person. A municipality of
100,000 inhabitants with an equivalent sewage plant would thus
entail a biogas production rate of 500 kW. A 50% electrical efficient
SOFC plant that consumes this available sewage biogas would then

Pproduce 250 kW of continuous electric power. A similar calculus can
be applied to animal farms. Manure is indeed a good substrate for
anaerobic digestion. The typical biogas yields from different animal
waste sources are summarized in Table 5. The specific biogas poten-
tial is much higher compared to sewage sludge as farming animals
have often higher living weight (this is the case of cattle, for
instance) and higher metabolic rates. Values in Table 5 are only
approximate estimates. For instance, the exact methane (or biogas)
yield from manure depends on many factors, e.g., the barn type (and
related systems for manure and other slurry effluents management),
the country, the age of the cow, and the digester (e.g., mesophilic,
thermophilic). For slurry-type waste in farms, a sensible range for
biogas production rate is 0.56(cid:1)1.5 m3/LLU/day (average value is
1.11 in Germany), for manure it is 1.5(cid:1)2.9 m3/LLU/day (average
value is 2.0 in Germany) [16]. Both average values are thus higher
than the value given by Smil [17]. For chicken farms, the typical
range is 3.5(cid:1)4 m3/LLU/day (the average value is 3.75 in Germany)
[16]. Since one chicken corresponds to 0.003 LLU, the resulting CH4
production rate is 0.010(cid:1)0.012 m3/chicken/day, which is a value
very close to that reported by Smil. For pigs, for slurry waste, the
range is 0.6(cid:1)1.25 m3/LLU/day (the average value is 0.88 in Germany)
[16]. Since one pig corresponds to 0.33 LLU, the resulting CH4 pro-
duction rate is 0.2(cid:1)0.41 m3/pig/day, which is again a value quite
consistent with the typical value given by Smil.

PThe biogas yield of different organic wastes is given by the
amount of methane (or biogas) produced from 1 kg of volatile solids.
In fact, it is useful to refer to the volatile solids (VS) content since
organic waste is mostly wet and not all the solid or suspended
organic content is digestible (and thus convertible to biogas). There-
fore, the VS content of a given organic substrate indicates the frac-
tion of solids that can produce biogas.

PIn Table 6 the methane yields of manure and food waste are
given. Interestingly, co-digestion of the two feedstock results in a
higher overall yield [18]. According to the authors, compared with
the digestion of food waste alone, co-digestion of manure and food
waste might reduce the accumulation of intermediates during the
initial period of digestion. The biogas yield of several organic solid
substrates is also reviewed in the work of Raposo et al. [19].

PAs we did for mixed urban and industrial wastewater and animal
waste, it is possible to calculate an intrinsic biogas potential produc-
tion rate for food waste. On average, the US inhabitant generates
about 2 kg of municipal solid waste (MSW) per day, which corre-
sponds to more than 700 kg/yr [20]. Of this amount, roughly 15% is

Table 6
Biogas yields from animal manure and food waste [18].

Pfood waste. (In Europe, food waste is comparable (cid:1) even if slightly
lower (cid:1) to that in North America; FAO estimates give for these
regions a per capita waste by consumers between 95(cid:1)115 kg a year
[21].) Using the biogas yield given in Table 6, the resulting per capita
methane production rate is about 18 L CH4/person/day, which corre-
sponds to a (chemical) power rate of 7.4 W (LHV basis). This value is
quite comparable to the sewage biogas potential.

2.2. Biogas final use

PBiogas is renewable energy that can be used for different services,
most commonly electricity and heat through cogeneration. Biogas is
also burned in boilers to recover thermal energy only.

PIn 2013, the EU-28 biogas electricity output stood at about 52.3
TWh, which corresponds to almost 4.5 Mtoe. Of this amount, about
two-thirds were produced in CHP mode. Heat provided to district
heating networks or industrial units accounted for less than 0.5
Mtoe. Self-use of thermal energy (for the digester and other thermal
needs of the plant) accounted for another 2.0 Mtoe [13]. By dividing
the overall electricity production by the overall biogas production in
2013 (13.38 Mtoe, see Table 3), we calculate an average electric con-
version efficiency of around 33.6%.

PA great impetus is now being given to biogas upgrading to meth-
ane fuel (also called ‘biomethane’). Different technologies can be
applied to remove CO2 and other impurities/gases from the biogas
stream (e.g., water or solvent scrubbing, membrane technology,
PSA) in order to obtain a purified stream containing a high concen-
tration of CH4 (i.e., >95 vol.), which is compatible with the gas grid
or for gas vehicles. Hence, biomethane can be either injected into
the grid or used as local transportation fuel [22].

2.3. Overview on the status of fuel cell technology in various sectors

PFuel cell technology is approaching maturity status in the mobil-
ity sector with first commercial deployments having started in
2015(cid:1)2016 [23]. Due to the fast dynamics operation required in this
sector, low-temperature technology like proton exchange mem-
brane (PEM) fuel cells dominate the scene with over 300 MW
installed in 2016 (which corresponds to 65% of the overall MW
installed in the same year). PEM technology is mostly used in the
transport sector, with 277.5 MW installed in 2016. Large additions
are expected in this segment, and not only from light duty fuel cell
vehicles, but from heavy-duty applications (buses, trams and light
trail). Of course, the installation of sufficient hydrogen infrastructure
(production sites, distribution and refueling stations) remains the
main challenge to solve for the market penetration of H2-based
mobility solutions [24].

PThe residential sector with combined heat and power (CHP) devi-
ces installed in single houses or multi-family buildings is also quite
developed compared (about 200 MW of new installations in 2016)
[25,26]. Field trials have been successfully completed or are ongoing.
Both PEM and SOFC technologies are currently deployed in this sec-
tor. In the framework of the Ene-Farm program, in Japan, about
120,000 fuel cell micro-CHP units had been already installed by
2015 [27]. In 2015 only, Ene-Farm installed around 50,000 units, of
which about 10,000 were SOFC.

PIn Europe, through the Callux program first (cid:1) launched across
Germany(cid:1) and then with the ene.field program across several EU
countries [28], the overall number of micro-CHP devices installed
will exceed 1000 units by 2016.

PThe use of fuel cells as stationary CHP generators is one of the
most important long-term objectives for the deployment of high-
temperature fuel cells. Both MCFC and SOFC technologies have the
potential to compete with engines and micro-turbines in the range
spanning from kW to a few MW, offering both higher energy effi-
ciency and environmental benefits. The intrinsic modularity and
excellent part-load performance make fuel cells particularly com-
petitive on this scale with variable fuel input supply. Variable fuel
supply is the situation often found when the FC is combined with
anaerobic digestion biogas or other bio-syngas fuels (e.g., from the
gasification of residual ligno-cellulosic biomass fuel). In the multi-
MW range, fuel cell hybrid concepts can be applied to compete with
engines and turbines, with also here the potential for higher electri-
cal efficiency and lower pollutant emissions [29(cid:1)32].

PThe typical power range of a single fuel cell module in the sta-
tionary market is 0.5(cid:1)400 kW for SOFC technology [33]. For MCFC,
larger capacities are typical for the single module (0.4 up to 2(cid:1)4
MWe). The status of commercial deployment of fuel cell distributed
generation in Europe is relatively limited so far. However, countries
such as Japan, South Korea and the United States have already
reached hundreds of MW of capacity installed from stationary fuel
cells (mostly MCFC systems). Korea is paving a way toward the com-
mercialization of distributed fuel cell generation with more than
200 MWe installed (MCFC) (cid:1) which is the world's largest fleet (by
MW) of stationary fuel cell systems, including the world's largest
fuel cell park at Hwasung, with 59 MWe [34]. The United States have
also invested significantly in stationary fuel cells, and California
alone has deployed more than 150 MW.

PThe commercialization of MCFC has preceded that of SOFC. After
several years of research programs and extensive demonstration,
MCFC-based systems are appearing in commercial ventures of multi-
ple megawatts, providing clean energy to commercial and small/
mid-size industrial customers all over the world [35].

2.4. High-efficiency electricity production from biogas

PBiogas is conventionally exploited in Internal Combustion
Engines (ICEs). The electrical efficiency of ICEs can exceed 40% for
units with an installed capacity of several hundreds of kW (>500
kWel) installations and is maximally about 43% for MW installations
up to few MW (<4 MW). However, the efficiency is lower for plants
with a capacity below roughly 200 kW electric [36]. The electrical
efficiency of SOFC technology lies in the range of 50(cid:1)62%. The build-
ing block is a 50(cid:1)400 kW unit that can be replicated several times to
reach even multi-MW plants [37]. The efficiency of ICE's is size-
dependent, as already mentioned. Fig. 3 compares the high-temper-
ature fuel cell technologies (both MCFC and SOFC) with data from
commercially available ICEs manufactured commercialized by Gen-
eral Electric [38] and AB Group [39], and microturbines manufac-
tured by Capstone. It is worth noting how the SOFC takes the highest
advantage at small-scale (below 200 kW) in terms of conversion effi-
ciency of biogas into electricity. Regarding emissions, the SOFC is
always outperforming ICEs since virtually no NOx, SOx and particu-
late matter are produced and emitted.

PThe electrical efficiency of ICEs is surpassed by high-temperature
fuel cell generators like molten carbonate fuel cells (MCFC) and solid
oxide fuel cells (SOFC), in particular in the lower power scale (<50
kWe). Especially, the SOFC technology is the most promising one
because these systems have proven to achieve the highest electrical
efficiency.

PThe exploitation of biogas fuel in SOFC generators has been stud-
ied for several years [40(cid:1)45]. Practical and operational experience

Fig. 3. Performance comparison between combustion systems (microturbines and
ICE) and high-temperature fuel cell systems (MCFC and SOFC technologies) for differ-
ent power sizes (ICE: black dot markers and red dot markers indicate machines with
NOx emissions below 500 and 250 mg/Nm3, respectively). Data for microGTs have
been taken from Capstone. Data for ICEs have been taken from General Electric and
AB. Data for SOFC and MCFC systems have been taken from the technical datasheets
of commercially available units. We surveyed products from BloomEnergy and SOLID-
power concerning the SOFC technology and products from FuelCell Energy concerning
the MCFC technology. Interestingly, the MCFC can now reach (since 2016) 60% electri-
cal efficiency by adding a third module, which recovers the unspent fuel of the first
two modules. The SOFC technology is the only one that exceeds the 60% efficiency.
Bloomenergy offers a FC module for electricity production only that can reach 62% AC
efficiency. The Bluegen module offered by SOLIDpower can also reach 62% net AC effi-
ciency.

Phas been gained through pilot plants. Industrial installations are also
gaining momentum. In California, a capital support is offered to fuel
cell installations with an additional bonus in case of biogas feeding.
The capital bonus is provided under the Self-Generation Incentive
Program (SGIP) [46] and the overall support is 2800 US$/kW
installed (1490 $/kW for fuel cell generation, plus an adder of 1310
for biogas fuel use; 100% of the support is awarded only to installa-
tions below 1 MW electric).

PA number of biogas-fed MCFC plants are already under operation
in California. Farooque et al. [47] have recently reviewed successful
installations of the Direct Fuel Cell(cid:1) by FuelCell Energy. Especially,
the authors have highlighted the beneficial use of biogas in MCFC,
which leads to higher conversion efficiency (by 0.5 percentage
points) compared to NG feeding. In fact, despite the anodic dilution
brought by CO2 present in the biogas, the performance loss at the
anode due to fuel dilution is compensated by a performance gain at
the cathode due to higher reactant (CO2) concentration at the cath-
ode. Farooque et al. [47] reported for the DFC running on biogas an
open circuit potential slightly higher (»4 mV) than the natural gas
system. Because of this intrinsic synergy between biogas and the
MCFC, and the previously mentioned subsidies, FuelCell Energy has
already installed several MCFCs in wastewater treatment plants (the
majority of them in California).

PSeveral plant configurations are potentially available for the
high-efficiency electrical generation in biogas-fed SOFC systems.
Large integrated biogas SOFC plants with either atmospheric or pres-
surized SOFC operation, SOFC-GT hybrid power generation with a
gas turbine as bottoming cycle and carbon capture via anode-
exhaust oxycombustion, were analyzed recently [48]. The overall
electrical efficiency of the analyzed plant configurations ranged in
the interval between 50(cid:1)70%. Hybridization of the SOFC with a gas
turbine bottoming cycle effectively boosts the electrical efficiency to
70% when fuel utilization (FU) is 90%.

PThere are additional advantages related to the use of biogas in
SOFC (or MCFC). We envision future energy plants with an enhanced
exhaust recovery [49,50] (e.g., hydrogen recovery) and carbon man-
agement (i.e., CO2 recovery and possibly further re-use). In the
framework of the EU-funded project SOFCOM [51], a 2 kWe SOFC
stack was operated with sewage biogas (Fig. 4). The integrated bio-
gas SOFC plant consisted of an innovative treatment of the anode
exhaust gas via oxy-combustion and subsequent water vapor con-
densation that allowed for the recovery of a high-purity CO2 exit

Pstream [52]. The CO2 was recycled to a photobioreactor in which
micro-algae biomass is harvested. In this way, a closed carbon cycle
was obtained in which organic carbon from sewage sludge is eventu-
ally recycled into another fuel (algae biomass). In the photobioreac-
tor, micronutrients (nitrates and phosphates) are taken from
wastewater that is circulated in a semi-closed loop. Hence, a further
biological water treatment process is achieved while growing bio-
mass (Table 7).

2.5. The issue of contaminants

PBiogas fuel contains on average 40(cid:1)65% vol. CH4 and 35(cid:1)50% vol.
CO2. A range of concentrations of the main biogas constituents is
provided in Table 8. Only landfill biogas might result in a composi-
tion that goes beyond ranges indicated in Table 8. Landfill biogas
(LFG) is produced from municipal solid waste that is stored in anaer-
obic underground or undercover waste cells. The biogas quality
varies significantly during the landfill lifetime. On average, a peak
production is reached 5 to 7 years after the waste has been dumped
in the landfill, after which a decreasing trend over time is observed
for the CH4 content in the extracted gas. Thus, the CH4 volume frac-
tion in landfill biogas can decrease below 50%. In landfills, almost all
gas is generally produced within a 20-year time frame; however,

Psmall quantities of gas may continue to be produced for 50 or more
years. Therefore low-methane yield, low-CH4 content scenarios are
also possible [56].

PIn anaerobic digesters, fluctuations in biogas production are
directly linked to the amount of organic matter treated. Especially,
there are daily and seasonal fluctuations in biogas production in
digesters using sludge from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs)
or livestock manure.

PNonetheless, apart from CH4 content and production variations (cid:1)
that are quite predictable and substrate dependent (cid:1) the main issue
with biogas is dealing with contaminants. The amount and type of
contaminants are widely varying depending not only upon the
organic substrate that undergoes anaerobic digestion (AD) but also
upon the digester operating conditions (temperature, hydraulic
retention time) and effluent pre-treatments prior to AD.

PSpecific contaminants present in AD biogas are hydrogen sulfide
(H2S), organic sulfur compounds such as mercaptans, COS, CS2, hal-
ides (e.g., HCl), siloxanes, aromatic compounds (e.g., toluene) and
terpenes (e.g., limonene) [63]. In LFG halocarbon compounds are
also quite abundant [64]. When biogas is used as a fuel for electricity
generation, trace compounds may damage the combustion engines,
necessitating additional maintenance costs for repairs and reducing
availability due to service interruptions. During the combustion pro-
cess, hydrogen sulfide is transformed to sulfur oxides (cid:1) SOx (e.g.,
SO2) (cid:1) that have adverse impacts on both human health (with an
increase of respiratory diseases) and the environment (acid rain).
SOx can also form acid gas like sulfuric acid (H2SO4) which can dam-
age the engine's components. Other corrosive acids like HCl and HF
are also formed to a lesser extent. Siloxanes are particularly detri-
mental since they are thermally decomposed into silicates and
micro-crystalline quartz, which contribute to abrasion of the inner
surfaces of the combustion engine [65], or deposits that interfere
with the active surfaces of fuel cell electrodes. Nair et al. [66] investi-
gated the effect of siloxane impurities on the performance of an
engine operating on biogas and they observed silica film deposition
on the internal metal surfaces of the engine piston heads, spark-
plugs and even the engine's oxygen sensors.

2.6. Economic feasibility of integrated biogas fuel cell plants

PHigh-temperature fuel cell systems based either on molten car-
bonate fuel cell (MCFC) or solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) technology are
being deployed in stationary applications for the generation of elec-
tricity and heat. Conventional MCFC systems can achieve an

Pelectrical efficiency up to 47% (LHV, NG or biogas fuel) [67,68].
Recently, FuelCell Energy [69] has introduced a new fuel cell system
configuration, which uses two carbonate fuel cell stacks that operate
in parallel, connected to a third one that is placed downstream and
in series with the previous two modules. The third module uses the
unspent fuel of the two previous modules to generate additional
power. This cascade configuration achieves 60% overall electrical
efficiency.

PSOFC systems can easily exceed values of 50%, with some systems
already reaching a net AC system efficiency equal or higher than 60%
(Fig. 3).

PThe uninstalled system cost of MCFC is in the range of
2500(cid:1)4500 US$/kW (ref. year 2012) [70]. The mentioned range
refers to systems from the few MW scale to the sub-MW scale with
an already established market of 70.5 MW installed in 2014, 68.6
MW in 2015 and 66.9 in 2016 [71]. SOFC modules are currently
more expensive than MCFC with a unit price cost above 10,000 US
$/kW for a 50 kW electric module [37].

PHowever, a market price equal to that of MCFC is expected to be

feasible as manufacturing capacity increases [72].

PThe clean-up capital cost is currently estimated to 500(cid:1)1000
$/kW (installed cost, ref. year 2015) [73]. A capital cost <500 US
$/kW is considered a near-term target, while the long-term target
sets the clean-up cost below 200 US$/kW [73].

3. Chapter 2 (cid:1) the origin of contaminants in anaerobic digestion
biogas: type and amounts of contaminants depending on the
organic substrate and in-situ abatement measures

PBiogas contains a large variety of trace impurities. Besides the
main gas constituents (CH4, CO2, and N2), different types and
amounts of contaminants are found in biogas depending on the
organic substrate and possible in-situ abatement measures (these
are mostly employed for H2S removal).

PSeveral factors affect the concentration of these impurities, e.g.,
temperature, pressure, type/origin of waste, the age of waste
(mainly for LFG). Table 9 shows typical untreated biogas impurities
concentrations for landfill and anaerobic digestion gas. It is worth
noting that halogens are very low in concentration in ADG (often
below 1 ppm), while higher amounts are often found in LFG.

PIn Table 10, the measured amount of halogens concentration in
the biogas from different landfill and WWTP sites is given [79]. Once
again, very low levels are observed in WWTP derived biogas com-
pared to landfill gas.

PHalogens are contained within waste in the form of kitchen salts
and polymers (polytetrafluoroethylene: PTFE, polyvinylchloride:
PVC). As such, these compounds are mostly found in biogas pro-
duced in landfills [80,81]. Fig. 5 compares organic chlorine com-
pounds (halocarbons) measured in landfill gas and biogas produced
from anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge. It is visible that average
concentrations in landfill gas are higher than maximum values
detected in gas produced from sewage sludge. In fact, the halogen

Pcontent in biogas from WWTPs lies in the same range as that in
biogas produced on farms, and values are very low (<1 ppm, on
average).

PH2S is generally the most abundant contaminant and is largely
found in digester gas coming from manure (hundreds or thousands
of ppm) and dairy streams, where it can range from 300 to
6000 ppm [82]. The Gas Technology Institute (GTI) reported an aver-
age H2S content of about 3000 ppm in raw biogas from diary
streams. Definitely lower amounts of other sulfur compounds are
also present (SO2 7.73 ppm, COS 4.09 ppm, CS2 0.17 ppm, methyl
mercaptans 6.12 ppm) [82]. Biogas from organic substrates derived
from animal waste products is also characterized by small amounts

Pof siloxanes (below 0.5 ppm) and halocarbons. Light hydrocarbons
(CnH2n+2 and CnH2n) are instead found in the single digit ppm(v)
range.

PSewage biogas also contains H2S, but often to a lesser extent (e.
g., below 100 ppm) because of the use of iron salts in the water
line. Iron salts are used in WWTPs to precipitate phosphorus (P) (cid:1)
whose concentration in treated water must not exceed limits regu-
lated by law in order to avoid eutrophication on land and aquatic
vegetation. They are also able to precipitate sulfur thus reducing
the overall H2S content in the as-produced AD biogas from sludge.
Fe2+ removes sulfide by precipitating it as ferrous sulfide (FeS),
while Fe3+ oxidizes sulfide chemically to elemental sulfur, with
itself being reduced to Fe2+, which subsequently precipitates sulfide
forming FeS [83].

PVolatile organic silicon compounds (VOSiC), also known as vol-
atile methyl siloxanes (VMS) or simply siloxanes, are recognized
as the most undesirable compounds in the AD biogas and LFG.
Siloxanes originate from silicone based compounds which are
often found in consumer products thus ending up in sewers (e.g.,
cosmetics, personal care products, adhesives and coatings, seal-
ants, etc.) [84,85]. Siloxanes are indeed the building blocks of
silicones. According to literature, the most frequent compounds
in sewage biogas are cyclic volatile polydimethylsiloxanes (D4,
D5), with D5 concentration being several times higher than D4.
Especially, D4 and D5 often make up 90% of the overall silicon
content of biogas. Biogas from municipal sludge digestion usually
has a higher siloxane concentration than landfill gas. Landfill gas
may contain significant quantities of other siloxanes, such as D3
and D6, as well as L2(cid:1)L5 (see Table 12 for the nomenclature). The
amount of siloxanes in old and closed landfills is generally lower
than in new ones, where silicon-containing waste is continuously
disposed of [81].

PThe main difference between landfill and AD gas regarding the
amount and type of siloxanes contained in it depends on the water
solubility of the organic silicon compounds. Water-soluble silox-
anes will tend to remain in the water phase, thus being discharged
back into the water system together with purified water, whereas

Pinsoluble siloxanes will adsorb into the activated sludge and
be partly transferred to the gas phase within the digester [81].
Due to their high hydrophobicity and volatility, cyclic volatile
methylsiloxanes (cVMS) largely tend to adsorb on activated sludge
flocks in aeration tanks within the WWTP [86]. Within the anaero-
bic digester, where the sludge can reach a temperature around and
above 40°C, siloxanes can significantly volatilize and end up in the
biogas. Among the various contaminants, siloxanes are certainly
the most detrimental for end-use devices for biogas valorisation
into electricity. In the combustion chamber of internal combustion
engines, siloxanes are oxidized to silicates (e.g., SiO2) [63]. The
accumulation of abrasive microcrystalline silica (SiO2) and silicates
deposits on an engine's mechanical parts (pistons, cylinder heads,
and valves) and leads to an early failure of the engine, require ear-
lier repairing and maintenance services [87]. Recently it has been
shown that siloxanes in digester biogas are highly detrimental also
for solid oxide fuel cells, even when present at the ppb(v) levels in
the anode feed, causing a rapid and irreversible degradation of the
fuel cell performance [88].

PBiogas produced from manure digestion does not contain silox-
anes, although the H2S and organic sulfur concentrations are gener-
ally much higher than for WWTP biogas or LFG. Additionally,
siloxanes are not found in biogas from pure food waste and dairy
streams.

PThe average siloxanes concentration in German WWTPs (308
plants were reviewed) is 14.9 mg/m3 (with values ranging in the
interval 0(cid:1)317 mg/m3) [81]. The silicon concentration in German
landfill gas varies between 1 and 8 mg/m3, which corresponds to
approximately 3 and 25 mg/m3 total siloxane [81].

PTable 11 provides a summary on the total Silicon content
found in biogas from WWTPs or landfill biogas (Table 11 summa-
rizes findings that follow more in detail in the remainder of this
chapter).

PTables 12 and 13 provide detailed information on the type and
amount of siloxanes found in WWTPs. The amount of total siloxanes
(or total Si) is quite scattered among the various plants. Except for a
few cases, the total Si concentration is consistently around or below
6 mg Si / m3 for WWTPs located in Europe.

PIn Table 14, an overview of the type and amount of siloxanes
measured in landfill sites is also provided. As for WWTPs, the situa-
tion is also quite scattered. However, on average, a lower silicon
content is found in LFG compared to sewage biogas.

PFinally, it is worth noting how, compared to the H2S concentra-
tion, the siloxanes concentrations are strongly fluctuating even on a
daily basis (Fig. 6). Often, the non-continuous sludge feeding to the
digester is responsible for the observed fluctuations.

P[94]. Janardhanan et al. [95] have shown how the direct internal
reforming of methane can significantly reduce the gas temperature
at the anode inlet section (see Fig. 7), which is due to the high cata-
lytic activity of the Ni-anode towards reforming reactions. The sud-
den anode gas cooling might be detrimental in terms of both a
higher risk of carbon deposition and an enhanced thermal gradient
across the SOFC cell.

PIn principle, biogas could be converted into a hydrogen-rich syn-
thesis gas simply by dry reforming reaction in presence of a suit-
able catalyst. However, since the inlet molar ratio CH4/CO2 is about
1.5, dry reforming alone can lead to significant carbon deposition
within the reactor [96(cid:1)98]. Therefore, it is desirable to add another
oxidant species to the biogas feed such as steam. The addition of

catalyst

4.1. Introduction

PBiogas essentially consists of a mixture of methane, carbon diox-
ide, nitrogen (to a lesser extent) and a wide range of trace com-
pounds (mostly H2S, siloxanes, hydrocarbons and other volatile
organic compounds), which might be tricky to remove below ppm
levels unless a deep clean-up stage is carried out [93]. In this context,
the utilization of a biogas fuel-processing unit instead of a direct bio-
gas feeding to the SOFC stack, is often the adopted design to protect
the fuel cell stack from the risk of carbon deposition, sintering of the
SOFC Ni-anode and poisoning of the electrochemical active sites

PFrom a thermodynamic point of view, both dry and steam meth-
ane reforming reactions are highly endothermic and thus external
heat must be provided to maintain a good activity on the catalyst.
Instead, the water gas shift reaction is mildly exothermic and heat
addition shifts the equilibrium gas conversion towards CO and
steam. High temperature (> 600°C) reforming with a steam-to-
carbon ratio equal or higher than 2 is required to provide a good
feed conversion without coke formation [98(cid:1)100]. Nickel-based cat-
alysts have been already investigated for biogas steam reforming
[101(cid:1)103]. Nickel is widely used for reforming applications because
it is less costly compared to noble metal-based catalysts [104,105].
The Ni-YSZ cermet (i.e., mixed ceramic-metallic electrode) used in
the state-of-the-art Ni-SOFC is also a good catalyst for steam meth-
ane reforming [106]. In fact, Ni-YSZ is used as catalyst in the pre-
reformer of commercial SOFC stacks [106].

PThe kinetics of steam methane reforming (SMR) on Ni is rela-
tively well known. Hecht et al. [107] provided a detailed mechanistic
scheme for SMR based on the molecular behavior at the catalytic
surface. The proposed reaction scheme counts 42 reactions for the
heterogeneous catalytic system having the Ni-YSZ solid surface and
a gas mixture of H2, CO, H2O, CO2 and CH4. The 42 irreversible reac-
tions include 6 gas-phase and 12 surface-adsorbed species (see
Table 15).

PAhmed et al. [105] tested the performance of a rhodium-based
catalyst for the steam-reforming of biogas, while varying the inlet
feed gas concentrations, the gas hourly space velocity, the reactor
temperature and the steam-to-carbon ratio.

PIt is worthwhile mentioning how the majority of the available lit-
erature on biogas reforming deals with catalytic experiments that
have been carried out with clean gas. The impact of fuel impurities
other than H2S has been overlooked. In fact (cid:1) in the most of the
experimental setups (cid:1) a synthetic biogas stream is obtained by mix-
ing pure CH4 and CO2 gases that are supplied in pressurized gas cyl-
inders. Nonetheless, the presence of fuel contaminants cannot be
excluded in real applications. More importantly, the effect of fuel
contamination can be substantial on both the performance and the
long-term durability of the fuel processor.

PThe issue of carbon deposition on Ni-based catalysts is instead
quite covered and will also be reviewed in this work. Light hydrocar-
bons (CnHm such as ethylene, ethane, propane etc.) can significantly
affect the formation of carbon species and thus the effectiveness of
the catalyst. The formation of carbon on the catalyst layer under
steam reforming conditions may take place mostly through cracking
of these higher hydrocarbons as well as through the Boudouard reac-
tion. Trimm [109,110] determined the coking tendency for steam
reforming of methane in the presence of C2- and C3-hydrocarbons
over a Ni catalyst. The coke formation increases with the carbon
number, especially in the presence of olefin species. D'Angeli et al.

a Most reaction rates are represented in the Arrhenius form or as a sticking coeffi-
cient. However, the net activation energy of reactions 12, 20, 21, and 23 depend on
the CO(s) coverage uCO(s). Arrhenius parameters for the rate constants are written in
the form: k D ATn exp((cid:1)E/RT). The units of A are given in terms of moles, centimeters,
and seconds. E is in kJ/mol.
b Sticking coefficient.
c Coverage-dependent activation energy. Total available surface density G is

expressed in mol/cm2 and represents a tuning parameter.

P[111] have also shown how coke formation increases with the
molecular weight of the feed and that deactivation rates during
steam reforming of ethane and propane over Ni/MgO were higher
compared to methane.

PBesides carbon deposition degradation issues, the most studied
contaminant for deactivation of the catalytic steam reforming on Ni
is sulfur, in the form of H2S. This contaminant leads to an almost
total deactivation of the catalyst. Catalyst poisoning occurs due to
the strong adsorption of sulfur on active sites. Adsorbed sulfur thus
blocks or alters the adsorptivity of the other species by an electronic
effect [112]. Overall, the saturation coverage of sulfur and other spe-
cies (e.g., HCl) depends on the operating temperature, metal loading,
and the partial pressure of reacting gases. Catalysts with lower metal
loading will lose their activity at a faster rate compared to catalysts
with higher metal loading [110,113]. This chapter will review the
impact of different biogas poisoning species on the reforming capa-
bility of Ni catalysts, including recent findings on impurities other
than H2S.

4.2. Effect of H2S poisoning

PThe presence of H2S in the biogas adversely affects the activity of
the nickel-based catalysts [114(cid:1)116]. Although desulphurization
technologies will reduce the amount of hydrogen sulfide present in
the biogas, residual post-cleaning concentrations (few ppm, or even
sub-ppm, concentrations) might be not be tolerated by the nickel-
based catalyst even in the case the fuel processor is operated at
higher temperatures (>700°C) [103,117]. Indeed, the presence of
sulfur was found to enhance nickel sintering as well as carbon depo-
sition [118] (see Table 16).

PThe poisoning effect of H2S on the catalytic surface during the
reforming of hydrocarbons is even more complex due to the compe-
tition among various molecules and radicals for the active sites. For
instance, the saturation coverage of H atoms on a catalytic surface is
significantly affected by the partial pressure of CO in the gas mixture.
The deactivation of the reforming catalyst was found to be exponen-
tial in time and deactivation times range from 5 to 20 h [103,117].
As expected, the deactivation trend is faster as the H2S concentration
is higher. A fast drop in the activity of the Ni catalyst on exposure to
H2S (20, 50 and 100 ppm) at high temperatures (700°C and 800°C)
has been reported by Appari et al. using simulated biogas on a Ni-
based catalyst [97]. Especially, for H2S concentrations above 20 ppm
in the biogas stream, an almost complete deactivation (98%) of the
catalyst was observed. All the investigated H2S concentrations led to
saturation coverage at 700°C, whereas at 800°C the mechanisms of
H2S adsorption and recombination reactions involving sulfur lead to
different saturation coverages of sulfur for different H2S concentra-
tions. Appari et al. have also developed a detailed kinetic model
for simultaneous dry and steam reforming of biogas on Ni based
catalyst, which highlighted how both CH4 and CO2 conversion was
blocked as soon as H2S was introduced [119].

PAppari et al. [97] have also investigated regeneration techniques
after sulfur poisoning. Key findings were that contamination at
lower temperature (700°C) is not fully reversible upon removal of
H2S from the feed stream. However, full performance recovery is
achieved at higher temperature (800°C).

PIn fact, CO2 was found to participate to the reforming reactions at
750°C only for S/C ratios below 2.5 mol/mol [119]. However, along
the length of the reactor, the poisoning is not uniform. At 700°C and
800°C the poisoning occurs from the inlet towards the exit of the
reactor as time proceeds. In fact as the poisoning proceeds, the loca-
tion of the methane reforming reaction moves downstream through
the reactor length.

PChattanathan et al. [120] investigated the effect of temperature
(650°C, 750°C and 800°C) and H2S concentration at exceptionally
high levels (0.5 mol%, 1 mol% and 1.5 mol%) on dry biogas reforming
using a commercial Ni-catalyst. Results showed how both CH4 and
CO2 conversion decreased drastically even at the lowest H2S concen-
tration (0.5 mol. %). Post-mortem analysis revealed that the coking
presence was mainly dominant in the absence of H2S, while it
became less pronounced with the introduction of H2S. However, no
sulfur presence was observed, as expected. These findings indicate
that the effect of sulfur poisoning on the catalyst behavior prevails
over coke formation (sulfur coverage of the Ni surface thus prevents,
or limits, carbon deposition). Chiodo et al. investigated the boundary
sulfur concentration on the commercial Ni-catalyst tested under
steam reforming conditions. Biogas steam reforming measurements
were carried out adding different H2S concentrations (0.4(cid:1)2 ppm) to
the inlet gas stream. Results showed how with 0.4 ppm of H2S the
catalyst activity remained stable for 100 h of test. However, the Ni-
catalyst resulted completely deactivated when the H2S concentra-
tion was increased to 1 and 2 ppm, respectively, even if different
deactivation rates were recorded. The rapid observed deactivation
clearly indicates that the amount of sulfur in the biogas had little
impact on methane conversion in the first hours of the catalytic
tests. This implies that the activity is affected by the cumulated
amount of sulfur poisoning, rather than by the inlet sulfur concen-
tration in the inlet gas stream. According to Chattanathan et al.
[120], the amount of carbon deposition that resulted was unaffected
by the amount of sulfur originally present in the fuel. In fact, the ele-
mentary analysis carried out on spent Ni-catalysts revealed carbon
¡1h¡1, which is very close to carbon
formation rates (cid:2)0.1 mgCgcat
deposition rates observed on Ni-samples working with a clean bio-
gas stream composed of solely methane and carbon dioxide.

PA way to achieve sulfur-resistant Ni-catalysts for the steam
reforming process is doping Ni with other elements [118]. Wang
et al. increased the sulfur tolerance by supporting nickel on ZSM-5
zeolite and by preparing bi-metallic Ni-Re, Ni-Co and Ni-Mo cata-
lysts [121]. The use of a ceria ion-exchanged ZSM-5 catalyst with
5 wt. % nickel content showed high activity in steam reforming of
kerosene and displayed little sensitivity to 20 ppm of sulfur. The
activity of a traditional Ni-catalyst was also improved by adding sec-
ond metals in the form of Re, Co and Mo, with Re displaying the
most promising results with both high activity and promising sulfur
tolerance.

PIn a series of papers, Xie et al. investigated the influence of sul-
fur on the steam reforming of liquid hydrocarbons on ceria-alumina

PNi, Rh and Ni-Rh catalysts [122,123]. Neither of the catalysts con-
taining nickel was stable in a sulfur-laden environment, even
though the Ni-Rh catalyst was deactivated less quickly. Results also
showed how carbon deposition was increased in the presence of
sulfur in the gas stream, and this effect was more pronounced with
respect to nickel. The deactivation by sulfur poisoning and carbon
deposition on Rh-Ni supported on alumina was also investigated by
Lakhapatri and Abraham [124].

4.3. Effect of light hydrocarbons

PSteam reforming of light hydrocarbons (CnHm) with n> 1 (i.e.,
a carbon number higher than methane) involves irreversible reac-
tions (Eq. (6)), and a high risk of carbon formation and catalyst
deactivation is expected [110]. Coke formation takes place via
cracking reactions (Eqs. (7) and (8)) as well as the Boudouard
reaction (5).

PFew studies have been reported in the literature about coke for-
mation by hydrocarbons that might be found in biogas [70]. How-
ever, several experiments were carried out with a methane feed
mixed with C2- and C3- compounds. Among the previous studies on
the topic, it was recently shown how a high carbon formation rate
¡1h¡1 after only 25 h of test) is promoted on Ni
(about 0.5 mgC/gcat
supported on Al2O3 catalyst by co-feeding 800 ppm of a mixture of
C2- and C3- compounds (i.e., both alkanes and alkenes) with a simu-
lated biogas stream (CH4/CO2 D 55/45% vol.) [125]. When the total
inlet hydrocarbons concentration was (cid:2)200 ppm, a stable methane
conversion rate was observed instead, with only a little amount of
carbon deposition (Fig. 8).

PThe abovementioned findings are in agreement with results
from Sperle et al. [129], who determined the coking tendency of
Ni/MgAl2O4 catalyst in methane steam reforming in presence of
C2 (ethane and ethene) and C3 (propane and propene). It was
found that at 500°C and S/CD 1, the tendency to coking increased
having compounds with a carbon number higher than one mixed
with methane. Especially, a dramatic increase was observed for
¡1h¡1 for the methane only
alkenes (from about 1 to 150 mggcat
and the methane/propane/propene mixture, respectively). Hence,
it is clear that the catalyst support plays an important role in
terms of coke deposition and catalyst deactivation. Sidjabat and
Trimm [110] elucidated the benefits of magnesia as a support for
nickel catalyst. They found that coke formation increased with
the molecular weight of the feed and that the deactivation rates
during steam reforming of ethane and propane over Ni/MgO
were higher compared to methane only. The rate of carbon

¡1h¡1 for Ni/
¡1h¡1 for Ni/MgO H2O and 4.66 mggcat
0.25 mggcat
Al2O3. These results strongly suggest that magnesia is catalyzing
the gasification of carbonaceous intermediates leading to coke,
thereby ensuring an active metal surface for steam reforming. Fur-
thermore, Didenko et al. [130] showed how Ni catalysts in pres-
ence of 2.7 mol % of ethene in methane steam reforming at 750°C
highlighted that the high value of the ratio of the catalytic surface
area to the free reaction volume (S/V) reduces the negative effect
of ethene in terms of carbon formation. It was supposed that the
positive influence of this factor is due to an increase in the contri-
bution of the heterogeneous component of steam reforming and
the corresponding increase in the rate of interaction of coke with
water vapor.

PBased on all the above reported results, the addition of different
oxides to the Ni reforming catalyst can help improving the catalytic
stability with time. Especially, ceria-based oxides promote the gasifi-
cation of surface carbon species [111]. Laosiripojana et al. [131]
found that ceria-doped Ni/Al2O3 improves the coke resistance for
the steam reforming of an ethane/propane mixture at 900°C com-
pared to Ni/Al2O3 (see Fig. 9).

4.4. Effect of minor contaminants (siloxanes)

PCatalyst deactivation might also occur due to masking or pore
blockage phenomena from carbon deposition. The presence of poi-
sonous substances in the feed other than sulfur might be also highly
detrimental for the performance of Ni catalyst. The deactivation
(often irreversible) might occur due to the physical deposition of for-
eign substances on the external surface of the catalyst. When dealing
with certain biogases, the risk of deposition of foreign particles is
especially high in the presence of siloxanes. Very few works are
reported in literature on the poisoning of Ni surfaces from organic
silicon compounds (siloxanes), and even fewer that refer to Ni elec-
trodes of solid oxide fuel cells (see for instance the work of Madi
et al. [88], which is also further discussed later in this paper).

PRecently, Chiodo et al. [125] performed steam reforming experi-
ments with simulated biogas contaminated with decamethyl-
cyclopenta-siloxane (D5). Results showed that the concentration
of 1 ppm of D5-siloxane promoted a fast catalytic deactivation,
whereas a stable performance was observed with a concentration of
D5 D 0.5 ppm (Fig. 10).

PPost-mortem analysis (SEM-EDX elemental mapping) on spent
Ni-catalysts revealed a large amount of micro-silica (SiO2) deposits
on the Ni-surface, the amount of which was quite remarkable, i.e.,
4.5 wt. % for the experiment with 1 ppm of D5 and 2.2 wt. % for the
experiment with 0.5 ppm of D5. Notably, the degradation effect is
cumulative. The gradual accumulation of micro-silica deposits on
the catalysts surface gradually inactivates the available catalytic
area.

considered sources of contamination.

PThe utilization of biogas feed in an SOFC leads to concerns regard-
ing carbon deposition and the effect of contaminants [134(cid:1)137] that
cause degradation in the cell/stack performance. Degradation can be
defined as the reduction of the functionality of an SOFC structure
from its designed state [138]. Degradation is often expressed as an
increase of area specific resistance (ASR), which is measured by I-V
curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The ASR
can be calculated using the following equation:

5. Chapter 4 (cid:1) SOFC and MCFC Ni-anode poisoning by biogas
impurities

5.1. SOFC Ni-anodes

PThe adsorption or deposition of contaminants at the three-phase
boundary (TPB) of the SOFC anode can drastically reduce the lifetime
of cells and stacks. Contaminants can also affect stack components
(namely interconnects and sealant); however, the region which
seems the most sensitive to contamination and related degradation
is the electrode interface with the electrolyte, where the electro-
chemical reactions occur. Hence, the durable performance of an
SOFC is strongly tied to the characteristics and evolution of electro-
des’
Irvine et al. [133] have
recently reviewed the key phenomena affecting the dynamic evolu-
tion of electrode interfaces and the three-phase, or two-phase,
boundary for both air and fuel electrodes of the SOFC. The accumula-
tion of impurities is one of the main sources of degradation, and can
be reversible or irreversible.

interfaces during operation [132].

PIn this section, we review the effect of sulfur, silicon and chlorine
compounds on the performance of Ni-SOFC anodes. External (or

where V0 is the open circuit voltage (OCV), I is the electrical current,
and Vi is the operating voltage at the given current I.

PVarious poisoning mechanisms have been proposed, and they
depend on the nature of the impurity. Sulfur at low and high concen-
trations causes adsorption-type and reaction-type degradation,
respectively [139]. Other chemical degradation mechanisms are sub-
limation-, deposition-, grain growth- and eutectic-types. In this sec-
tion, we focus on the chemical durability of SOFC cells and stacks
when exposed to by exogenous species such as sulfur, chlorine, and
siloxanes at operating temperature.

P5.1.1. Sulfur poisoning

PThe interaction between sulfur-containing molecules and Ni-
based anode materials is an important research topic in SOFCs.
There are several studies concerning the loss in SOFC perfor-
mance upon sulfur poisoning as a function of temperature, H2S
concentration, time, current load and anode material [140(cid:1)146].
Ni-YSZ anode-supported SOFCs have limited tolerance towards
sulfur compounds [147(cid:1)149]. Table 17 summarizes studies on
the characterization of different anode materials upon exposure
to H2S-containing fuels. The performance degradation is a result
of an increase in the internal resistance of the SOFC. The poison-
ing is reported as a two-step process; a rapid initial drop in the
performance followed by a slower prolonged degradation. How-
ever, performance stabilization after the initial fast drop is also
observed.

PThe initial performance drop is due to dissociative chemisorp-
tion of hydrogen sulfide on nickel active sites and blocking of
the three-phase boundary for hydrogen oxidation. The reaction
is the following:

PH2S has unshared e¡ pairs, which can lead to very strong
chemisorption on the metal surface. The cell performance can be
reversible, depending on exposure concentration and duration.
Reversibility has been observed in the case of exposure to concentra-
tions below 50 ppm(v) and short duration [144]. Zha et al. [150]
evaluated the recovery of the fuel cell performance after exposure
to 2 and 50 ppm H2S at 800°C and observed a recovery of 99% and
96% respectively, 50 h after stopping the H2S exposure. Shiratori
et al. [149,151] showed that 1 ppm H2S contamination in biogas
caused about 9% voltage drop and about 40% decrease in the reaction
internal dry reforming (at 1000°C, under 200 mA/cm2,
rate of
CH4/CO2 D 1.5): in fact, H2S, even in small amounts (ppb-level),
deactivates the steam-reforming and water gas shift reactions. This
degradation was reversible and the performance stable after stop-
ping the sulfur supply. Hagen et al. [146] observed a significant irre-
versible degradation in performance when the cell was poisoned
with 2 ppm H2S over 500 h under a high current load of 1 A/cm2. At
higher H2S concentrations (>100 ppmv), sulfur will react with nickel
and bulk sulfidation (NiS, Ni3Sx) occurs, causing irreversible damage
to the anode catalyst. The initial drop in voltage upon exposure to
H2S has been the focus of most studies in the literature [152(cid:1)154].
Papurello et al. [142] quantified and correlated the surface coverage
of sulfur on nickel-based anodes to sulfur concentration in the fuel
with experiments performed both on a single cell and a stack. A
Temkin-like adsorption isotherm [155] was used which describes
well the time-to-coverage, and which is essential in order to deter-
mine the first degradation time. Results showed that, in anode-sup-
ported cells, sulfur contamination affects the entire available Ni
surface and not just the TPB. Therefore, a wide deactivation of the
Ni anode is expected also involving sites for heterogeneous cataly-
sis (i.e., those sites involved in the chemical reactions of internal
reforming and water gas shift). In Fig. 11, the mechanism of S
chemisorption on a Ni surface is shown. Adsorbed atoms of S form
a c(2 £ 2) structure on the Ni(100) surface at high coverage (> 0.7).
The S/Ni atomic ratio is 0.5. The corresponding atomic density is
8 £ 1014 S atoms per Ni cm2 [115,155,156]. The validity of the Tem-
kin-like chemisorption isotherm proposed by Alstrup et al. [115] is
in the range 500(cid:1)750°C and H2S concentration in H2 between 7
and 50 ppm. The same authors have also reported good agreement
with the proposed isotherm for chemisorption experiments con-
ducted at higher temperatures. Hansen and Papurello et al.
[155,156] have further verified and extended verified the validity of
the Temkin-like isotherm on Ni-anodes tested in relevant SOFC
conditions (Hansen has verified the validity for the temperature

Prange 700(cid:1)1000°C, and the concentration of hydrogen sulfide
between 0.05 and 50 ppm).

PThe mechanism of H2 oxidation and the nature of the rate-deter-
mining step remain controversial. Adsorption/desorption, surface
diffusion, and charge-transfer reactions having all been suggested as
plausible mechanisms [157]. In the conventional Ni-YSZ anode, the
more likely mechanism is H2 adsorption on the Ni surface. Adsorbed
hydrogen ions are formed, which migrate to the site of steam forma-
tion along the Ni surface (or through bulk Ni and electrolyte). The
involved reactions are:

H2 gð ÞÐ2H

þ þ 2e(cid:1)

ð11Þ

(cid:1)(cid:1)ÐH2O gð Þ

ð12Þ
PTherefore, adsorbed S on the Ni surface thus prevents the
charge transfer process causing the observed sudden increase in
cell polarization.

PNonetheless, the electrolyte type should also be accounted for in
the attempt to understand S-deactivation of the Ni-anode. A Ni-SSZ
(scandia-stabilized zirconia) cermet resulted in higher tolerance
towards sulfur poisoning compared to a conventional Ni-YSZ (yttria-
stabilized zirconia) [158,159]. This evidence comes in support of
the H2 oxidation mechanism under which steam formation takes
place at the stabilized zirconia surface, in proximity of the three-
phase boundary, and electron transport occurs through both Ni and
the electrolyte surface, summarized by the following reaction:

POxygen ions are transported through the electrolyte at the anode
interface; here the charge transfer step is accomplished. Sasaki et al.
[159], comparing the poisoning of both Ni-YSZ and Ni-ScSZ anodes,
concluded that the higher ionic conductivity of SSZ, compared to
YSZ, might be responsible for the different sulfur sensitivity of the
two cermets. A higher ionic conductivity of electrolyte materials
would lead to an extended three-phase boundary. Finally, Hagen
et al. [146] have shown that the steam reforming activity (i.e., CH4
conversion) seems not to be affected by the electrolyte type (YSZ vs.
ScSZ). However, again Ni-ScSZ showed more resistance towards
sulfur poisoning.

PThe reversible adsorption of sulfur on nickel surfaces was first
reported by Perdereau and Oudar [160] in 1970, followed in 1971 by
Rostrup(cid:1)Nielsen [114]. Sulfur chemisorption isotherms with sulfur
concentration at a level of a few ppm and elevated temperatures
were measured. Results have shown how chemisorbed sulfur pos-
sesses a more negative heat of formation than the most stable bulk
sulfide Ni3S2. According to McCarty and Wise [161], chemisorbed S
is 93 kJ kmol¡1 energetically more stable than bulk sulfide (Ni2S3) at
527°C. They studied the thermodynamics of sulfur chemisorption on
metals, including an alumina-supported Ni catalyst. Several sulfur
chemisorption isosteres were evaluated varying the temperature
in the range 204 (cid:1) 590°C and for different initial concentrations
of H2S, measuring for each condition the sulfur coverage (i.e., the
ratio of adsorbed sulfur compared to the available Ni surface, the
latter previously measured by CO adsorption experiments). Results
showed how the enthalpy of reaction decreases with higher cover-
age fractions.

PThe reversible adsorption of S on Ni is well-described by the equi-
librium sulfur coverage function [115], from which the coverage
fraction, us, can be calculated as a function of both temperature and
the H2S concentration in the gas phase. The equilibrium coverage is
thus expressed by the following equation:

PExperiments [161] have shown how the enthalpy term is affected
by coverages above »0.70, showing a decrease of the heat of adsorp-
tion as the sulfur coverage approaches saturation. By fitting experi-
mental data, the entropy term resulted instead as independent from
the coverage within the same range. The physical interpretation is
that the adsorbed S film gets more unstable because of repulsive
forces exerted between adjacent chemisorbed sulfur atoms. The fact
that the entropy term does not depend on coverage is connected to
subsurface chemisorption [115]. More details on the sulfur chemi-
sorption on nickel active sites can be found in ref [162]. Eq. (14)
has been used recently to correlate data on sulfur coverage on nickel
surfaces in H2 environment [155]. The following values have been
determined by means of a nonlinear least-square fit on experimental

PFig. 12 shows the dependency of the sulfur coverage on the H2S
concentration and temperature. As the operating temperature of the
SOFC is reduced, the coverage of active sites by sulfur grows, thus
making the proper management (removal) of the clean-up unit
more critical towards sulfur compounds.

PEventually, the performance drop of the fuel cell performance
due to H2S poisoning is linearly dependent upon sulfur coverage as
shown in the work of Papurello et al. [142] (see Fig. 13).

PConcerning long-term degradation by sulfur poisoning, the idea
is that Ni surface reconstruction might occur, enhanced by adsorbed
S or S-species. Ni mobility is always present at the relevant SOFC
operating temperature range, causing Ni coarsening or agglomera-
tion [163,164]. However, different from simple agglomeration, a

tion (atmospheric pressure operation is assumed) (own calculation based on Eq. (15)).

ronments (reprinted with permission from Papurello et al. [142]).

Pchange in the Ni surface morphology can be observed in the case of
prolonged exposure of Ni anodes to H2S [165]. For instance, Ivey
et al. observed a terracing phenomenon. The extent of terracing was
shown to be increasing with increasing H2S levels and exposure
time. Every change of the original as-reduced Ni morphology can,
but need not, lead to a reduction of Ni- phase connectivity and TPB.
Therefore, long-term degradation connected to S-poisoning is not as
easily explained as the fast degradation type linked to S-coverage of
Ni sites.

P5.1.2. Chlorine poisoning

PThe effect of HCl and other chlorine compounds like CH3Cl and
Cl2 on SOFC performance has been addressed in several studies
[148,166(cid:1)168]. Table 18 summarizes these studies on the character-
ization of different anode materials upon exposure to Cl-containing
fuels.

PTrembly et al. [2] observed an excessive degradation rate in cell
performance due to exposure to HCl at 160 ppm, and believed this
degradation to be due to the formation of nickel chloride. The results
also implied that this chloride phase was not stable, because of the
observed reversibility of the poisoning caused by HCl. Adsorption of
chlorine onto Ni to reduce the triple phase boundary (TPB) was pos-
tulated as another explanation. Chemisorption of HCl on Ni and the
chlorination of the Ni surface as possible mechanisms were pro-
posed by Xu et al. [169]. They investigated the effect of HCl at the
concentration of 100 ppm on a Ni-YSZ anode-supported cell. This
evaluation showed no degradation for the first 100 h of the test;

cluded that redistribution of Ni particles (which can either enhance

PMadi et al. [3] evaluated the poisoning effect of hydrogen chlo-
ride (HCl) on state-of-the-art Ni anode-supported SOFCs at 750°C
using either hydrogen or syngas fuel. Experiments were performed
on single cells and short stacks. HCl concentration in the fuel gas
was increased from 10 ppm(v) up to 500 ppm(v) at different current
densities, Fig. 14. Single cell experiment results showed that the poi-
soning is more severe when feeding with hydrogen than with syn-
gas. Further experiments indicated higher degradation rates at
higher current densities. These results are close to the findings of Xu

Pet al. [171], who explain this behavior by chemisorption of HCl on Ni
and blockage of active sites by these species. As current increases,
the impact of having a reduced TPB gets more pronounced and so
the HCl-poisoning effect is enhanced.

PDetailed impedance spectroscopy analysis of Madi et al. [3] in
investigating the processes affected by exposure to HCl showed that
two processes, one occuring at high to medium frequencies (kHz)
and another one at low frequencies (1 Hz) were involved. The distri-
bution of relaxation times (DRT) evaluation combined with an equiv-
alent circuit revealed that HCl causes degradations at the TPBs
(2(cid:1)4 kHz) and fuel conversion impedance (below 1 Hz). This report
concluded that the increase in cell resistance with exposure to HCl
can be due to the presence of electronegative atoms such as Cl which
hinder the adsorption of H2 on Ni surfaces Eq. (16) and also to the
formation of NiCl2 (g) via Eq. (17), which limits the TPB reaction
sites. The recovery of the samples was also investigated in this work.
Switching to HCl-free fuel gas enabled a partial recovery of the initial
performance. Yet, the impedance response did not recover for pro-
cesses related to the TPB, which indicates irreversible modification /
reconstruction of the TPB.

PInterestingly, investigation by Madi et al. [3] showed that the
stack performance was not affected by HCl up to 500 ppm in an
anode feed simulating a biogas reformate [3]; actually the perfor-
mance was slightly improved over the test. Even if degradation of
the Ni-anode has sometimes been observed, a consistent trend of
degradation when feeding HCl to the SOFC is not observed through-
out the literature.

PMadi et al. [3] have recently reviewed and elucidated the poten-
tial Ni-anode degradation mechanism in the presence of HCl. They
suggest that Ni changes are expected to take place leading to a redis-
tribution of Ni particles that can enhance the TPB rather than reduc-
ing it. This redistribution phenomenon is confirmed by findings
from other researchers [168,171].

PFurther, Madi et al. [3] performed SEM-EDX on the exposed sam-
ples. Traces of Cl at the edges of Ni grains were observed (Fig. 15).
XPS analysis of Xu et al. [171] also showed traces of Cl at the anode
cross-section and the anode surface. According to Trembly et al. [2],
the formation of a secondary nickel phase, NiCl2(s), is not feasible.
Therefore, Cl is present in the form of adsorbed species, rather than
as a chlorine nickel compound.

P5.1.3. Siloxane poisoning

PThermodynamic calculations of Madi et al. [88,172] showed that
siloxanes decompose at high temperatures and formation of SiO2(s)
is evident. The calculations also indicated that, even at low concen-
trations of siloxanes, Si could affect Ni-based anodes via the forma-
tion of NiSi and Ni2Si. Haga et al. [173] investigated the effect of D5-
siloxane at different temperatures on the cell performance and
observed a marked degradation. Their post-mortem analysis revealed

Pthe plugging of the anode structure with SiO2(s) deposits. They con-
cluded that the presence of siloxane can cause deposition-type deg-
radation, associated with the formation of SiO2(s) according to the
following reactions:

PMadi et al.

[88,172] evaluated the degradation of anode-
supported Ni-YSZ SOFC single cells and short stacks by siloxane D4,
by electrochemical characterization and micro-structural analysis.
Experimental results showed a marked performance degradation
with this impurity as shown in Figs. 16 and 17. In Fig. 16, two
commercial single cells were exposed to the same concentration of
D4 (3 ppmv) and in both cases large performance drop in a short
period of time can be observed. Increasing the concentration of D4,
the performance becomes worse. In the case of stack exposure to
D4 (Fig. 17), lower concentrations of D4 have been examined (from
69 ppbv up to 1 ppmv). Even at 69 ppbv of D4 the degradation rate
is about 5% per 1000 h, which is considerably high and degradation
increases with the load of contaminant in the anode stream.

PEDX analysis of an exposed sample proved that Si condenses
and deposits everywhere: on the current collector (Fig. 18- right),
the anode support (Fig. 18- left), and down to the electrolyte inter-
face at the three-phase boundary, which is responsible for the
observed loss in electrochemical performance. A larger amount of
Si was deposited at the anode surface with a gradient towards the
electrolyte as shown in Fig. 19. For the short stack experiment, a
gradient in the deposition of Si between inlet and outlet fuel sec-
tions was evidenced, with more Si deposited at the fuel
inlet
regions both within and on the cell as well as on the interconnect
plate.

PThe deposition of Si-compounds takes place due to the fast
decomposition of the siloxane to SiO2 as it reaches the fuel cell
anode chamber, thus depositing silica both on the interconnect and
anode current collector. Some Si also remains in the vapor phase as
Si(OH)4, according to Eq. (19), that further diffuses to the TPB region
where it eventually precipitates too.

PMadi et al. [88,172] also investigated performance recovery after
exposure to such contamination. Based on thermodynamic calcula-
tion, it was attempted to reduce the formed SiO2 (s) to SiO (g) and
then remove them from the TPBs. Two ways were proposed to revo-
latilize the deposited SiO2 (s) to SiO (g); increasing temperature or
operation at OCV after exposure. In that investigation, the second
idea was examined and EIS analysis indicated a certain recovery by

Poperating the cell at OCV, but only partially. In conclusion, siloxanes
have to be removed completely from the biogas feeding the SOFC.
Even trace contamination of the fuel feed at ppb level can affect the
SOFC Ni anode, leading to fast degradation.

5.2. MCFC Ni-anodes

PThe application of the MCFC with biogas fuel is already a rela-
tively mature and exploited solution as already described in Chapter
1. In this section, we briefly review the impact of biogas contami-
nants on MCFC Ni-anodes. The state-of-the-art anode electrode of
the MCFC is Ni(cid:1)10 wt.% Cr or Ni(cid:1)5 wt.% Al and the typical tempera-
ture operating range is between 550 and 650°C.

PThe literature on MCFC technology is quite limited compared to
that available for SOFC. Most of the literature on MCFCs, and espe-
cially the most recent works, analyses system configurations for CO2
capture from existing coal or NG-fired plants using [175(cid:1)177]. In
fact, the CO2-rich flue gas of a fossil power plant could be directed to
the cathode of a MCFC that will concentrate the CO2 at the anode
side for its capture. Sanchez et al. [178] have also analyzed a configu-
ration in which a MCFC is installed in a wastewater treatment plant.
Biogas is burnt in reciprocating ICEs and the exhaust gas (still rich in
oxygen and CO2) is fed to a downstream MCFC, which is also fed
with biogas. The anode exhaust of the MCFC is then oxy-combusted
to recover an almost pure CO2 stream.

PRetrofitting existing fossil power plants with a MCFC brings the
issue of cathode contamination from the SO2 contained in the flue
gas [10,179]. Della Pietra et al. [179] describe the phenomenon of
SO2 contamination at the cathode of the MCFC. SO2 reacts with the
carbonate ion and oxygen to form the sulfate ion and CO2:

CO2(cid:1)

þ SO2 þ 1

O2 ! SO2(cid:1)

ð20Þ

ð21Þ

ð22Þ

þ H2S ! H2O þ CO2 þ S2(cid:1)

PUnder load conditions, sulfate ions migrate to the anode, accu-
mulating in the electrolyte. At the anode side, sulfur might be then
released as H2S according to Eq. 21. As reported by Della Pietra et al.
[179], beyond corrosion issues of metal parts, SO2 poisoning will
thus bring to both a transfer (substitution) of CO2(cid:1)
3 charge carriers in
the electrolyte with sulfate ions as well as sulfur contamination at
the anode side, since H2S will be then released at the anode compart-
ment. Rexed et al. [180] have also investigated the effect of SO2 poi-
soning on the MCFC cathode. The authors conducted experiments
that support the fact that sulfur transfer occurs through the electro-
lyte, which leads to the formation of H2S at the anode. The authors
tested both H2S and SO2 contamination at the anode and cathode of
a button MCFC, respectively, to discover that the effect on anode
polarization of H2S in fuel gas was equivalent to that of SO2 in oxi-
dant gas. Therefore, cathode and anode sulfur contamination are
intertwined processes in the MCFC. Rexed et al. [180] have also
shown how the anode poisoning effects were largely reversible by
regeneration with clean gas. The cathode, however, experienced an
irreversible polarization increase after 100 h exposure to 8 ppm SO2.
PWeaver and Winnick [181] were the first to identify the sulfata-
tion of the molten carbonate fuel cell anode as the main degradation
mechanism in the presence of H2S. Eqs. (21) and (22) describe the
sulfatation process (i.e., carbonate replacement by sulfur species,
such as sulfide and sulfate). Hydrogen sulphide can also react with
carbonates via electrochemical processes [181,182].

PZaza et al. [183] have tested the effects of H2S poisoning on Ni
anodes. Results show how the cell polarization is negatively affected
already at 2 ppm H2S in the anode fuel (Fig. 20). Cigolotti et al. [184]
have tested the impact of low H2S concentrations (1(cid:1)8 ppm) on the

Fig. 20. H2S poisoning of a MCFC Ni-anode. Cell operating conditions: 160 mA cm¡2,
650°C; 1 atm; cathode gas O2:N2:CO2 D 14.41:54.22:31.37 vol. %; anode gas H2:N2:
CO2 D 47.6:47.6:4.8 vol.% (Reprinted with permission from Ref. [183]).

PMCFC fed with biogas. The fuel cell performance has been analyzed
through the impedance analysis spectroscopy technique. Even
1 ppm of H2S resulted in a fast increase of the cell polarization. The
authors concluded that H2S chemisorption on the nickel anode, with
the consequent blocking of catalytic sites for the water gas shift
reaction and electrochemical reactions, was responsible for the
observed performance loss.

PTo summarize the key findings in this section, at low H2S levels
two poisoning mechanisms occur: sulfur adsorption on the nickel
surface by the reaction and replacement of carbonate ions with sul-
fide and sulfate ions. H2S contamination at the anode of the MCFC
anode by sulfur chemisorption on the Ni surface shares essentially
the same mechanism as for SOFC Ni-anodes, which has already been
reviewed in this chapter. At higher H2S levels (thousands of ppm of
H2S), Ni-S solid solutions could also be formed. However, this a con-
dition quite unrealistic for the operating life of the MCFC since a fuel
clean-up system is always available.

PIn commercial MCFC systems, the typical requirement on the
anode fuel in terms of purity is below 100 ppb(v) for total sulfur.
Hence, sulfur is fully recognized as extremely harmful for the opera-
tion of the fuel cell plant. Even if an almost full performance recov-
ery has been shown feasible after restoring operation with a clean
fuel, the real-life application of MCFCs requires an ultra-pure sulfur-
free fuel to guarantee stable and durable performances. MCFC ano-
des also suffer from siloxanes [68], as SOFC anodes do. Therefore,
siloxanes must be typically removed below 100 ppb level.

PWatanabe et al. [185] have investigated the effects of several
impurities (H2S, SO2, HCl, HF and NH3) on single cells. H2S resulted
as the most harmful contaminant. When feeding the MCFC with a
H2-rich reformed gas, a tolerance up to 5 ppm was demonstrated.
However, in the presence of higher amounts of CO, the tolerance
toward H2S dropped below 1 ppm to maintain a stable perfor-
mance. In fact, H2S has a strong inhibiting effect on the WGS reac-
tion. SO2 poisoning was shown to produce a similar effect as H2S
(which is perfectly consistent with findings reported previously in
this section). SO2 also corrodes the metal hardware used as the oxi-
dant inlet (corrosion-resistant metals such as Incoloy should be
used). Regarding the halogen compounds, the addition of 10 ppm
HCl has no effect on the cell voltage over several thousand hours
(which is consistent with findings reported for SOFC Ni-anodes). In
the case of HF, the authors reported a low influence on the perfor-
mance over a short period of time. Finally, the impact of NH3 in the
anode fuel has been tested without any significant impact on the
fuel cell performance.

6. Chapter 5 (cid:1) processes and materials for biogas contaminants
removal

6.1. Biogas purification processes

PThis chapter is dedicated to the removal of biogas contaminants.
Since both reformer and fuel cell electrode can suffer significantly by
the presence of contaminants, it urges their removal.

PThe variety of trace contaminants depends on the used organic
substrate (e.g., urban solid waste in a landfill, sludge from wastewa-
ter treatment plants,
food waste, manure, etc.) [75]. Papadias
and Ahmed [70] recently compiled an extensive database of
contaminants found in biogas from WWTPs and landfilling; the data-
base collects information on impurities such as sulfur compounds,
organic silicon compounds (siloxanes), halogens, paraffines, cyclic
hydrocarbons, and aromatics. One of the main drawbacks for
SOFCs fed by biogas is indeed the impact of trace compounds on the
anode electrode. The low or very low tolerance towards certain fuel
impurities (cid:1) mostly sulfur, chlorine and siloxane compounds (cid:1) that
can adversely affect the fuel cell efficiency and reduce the lifetime
due to rapid degradation of the anode [136,142,148,194(cid:1)196]. For
this reason, a gas clean-up section is required to remove harmful
contaminants and thus meet the SOFC gas purity requirements [70].
PBiogas purification methods can be divided into two broad cate-

gories [197]:

P(cid:4) those involving physicochemical phenomena (adsorption and
chemisorption on solid sorbents and absorption processes in
either aqueous solutions or scrubbing in solvents or other liquid
phases);

P(cid:4) those involving biological processes (e.g., bio-trickling).

PMethods for the removal of H2S and siloxanes are reviewed in
detail in the following paragraphs since these compounds are often
found in biogases in relatively large amounts.

PThe removal of tars (e.g., toluene, naphthalene) is not reviewed in
this work. This is because there is a negligible amount of tars and
heavier hydrocarbons in biogases [70]. Nonetheless, the issue of tars
is central for bio-syngas from biomass gasification [198]. Also, tars
can be detrimental to the SOFC performance at elevated concentra-
tions as they cannot be internally reformed thus leading to carbon
deposition and catalyst deactivation [199]. Aravind and de Jong have
extensively reviewed gas cleaning methods and processes for hot
product gas from biomass gasifiers [198].

PAfter describing methods and materials for biogas clean-up, the
main equations used to model adsorption-based systems are pre-
sented in this section. Different kinetic formulations are reviewed as
well as the other transport equations that are required to model full-
scale adsorption vessels.

PThe typical experimental set-up to test solid sorbent materials,
and some examples of adsorption curves on activated carbons until
breakthrough of the contaminant is reached, are presented in the
final part of this section. Some engineering aspects of clean-up sys-
tems are also discussed. The different reactor configurations for
adsorption-based systems are briefly reviewed.

P6.1.1. H2S removal

PIn-situ abatement techniques are viable for H2S (partial) removal
either directly in the sludge or in the anaerobic digester. Having air
(2(cid:1)6 vol. %) in the digester headspace, or adding iron salts in the
sludge feed or directly in the digester, are often employed techni-
ques for a partial H2S abatement.

PThe effect of adding iron salts was previously described in this
work. Thus, we focus the discussion here on the aerobic removal of
H2S. Aerobic conditions within the digester can promote the activity
of sulfide-oxidizing bacteria (SOB) which are present in the sludge

Pand proliferate in the digester. Even the injection of a small amount
of pure oxygen is efficient for H2S removal
in sewage sludge
digesters. The presence of air (or oxygen) leads to chemical and bio-
logical oxidation of H2S to S0. Díaz et al. [200] have recently com-
pared the techno-economic performance of micro-aerobic removal
of H2S with O2 injection in full-scale digesters against more conven-
tional methods of in-situ sulfur abatements, which are air injection
into the digester, addition of FeCl3 (iron salts) to the raw sludge and
addition of an iron-sponge-bed filter inoculated with thiobacteria in
the digester. According to their results, the microaerobic treatment
consisting in supplying concentrated O2 to the reactors was proved
the most profitable alternative to FeCl3 addition in the WWTP.

PNext we describe methods for H2S removal from the biogas
stream. The chemical affinity of H2S for metallic cations drives pro-
cesses employing chemical absorption. Chemical absorption of sul-
fur in aqueous solutions involves either the oxidation of S2¡ to S0 or
the capture of S2¡ through precipitation of its metallic salts [197].
For example, to the first method belongs the oxidative absorption of
H2S and O2 by iron-chelated solutions. The H2S is removed by means
of chemical absorption in an iron-chelated solution catalyzed by
Fe/EDTA, which converts H2S into elemental sulfur (S0) [201]. The
formation of S occurs by means of sulfide oxidation by the chelated
iron according to the reaction described by Eq. (23).
S2(cid:1) þ 2Fe3þ , S0 þ 2Fe2þ

ð23Þ
PA possible alternative is to use alkaline solutions (e.g., NaOH or
CaO based solutions) to react with H2S. A detailed review of the
absorption methods is provided by Abatzoglou and Boivin [197].

PDry processes are based instead on the selective adsorption of
trace compounds on solid adsorbents. Adsorption is the only tech-
nique which can reduce the concentration of contaminants to the
extent of fuel cell specifications [197]. Often, these processes are
adopted in a semi-batch configuration. This is due to the gradual sat-
uration of sorbent material and problems related to the regeneration
of the same. However, continuous operation is also possible depend-
ing on the choice of the gas clean-up reactors’ configuration. System
layouts with redundant reactors (in either parallel configuration or
lead-and-lag configuration) indeed allow for continuous operation.

PIron oxide adsorbents are mainly adopted for sulfur removal
[197]. Often, iron oxides are used for bulk sulfur removal. The best-
known iron oxide adsorbent is iron sponge, which consists of an H2S
adsorption media, typically iron oxide or hydroxide, coated onto a
supporting material traditionally comprised of wood chips or wood
shavings [202].

PThe chemical reactions involved in sulfur removal are given

below:

ð25Þ
PAccording to the stoichiometry of the first reaction, the theoreti-

ð

Þ

cal removal efficiency is 0.64 kg H2S/kg Fe2O3.

PEither operation in batch mode with regeneration or continuous
operation with a small amount of air in the feed stream is possible
for this type of H2S-removal process. However, according to Abatzo-
glou and Boivin [197], iron-sponge activity is reduced by one-third
after each regeneration cycle. Hence, regeneration can be carried out
only once or twice before replacing the entire batch.

PNonetheless, the preferred operating mode is continuous regen-
eration by co-feeding some air (oxygen) with biogas. In this case,
removal rates are as high as 2.5 kg H2S/kg Fe2O3. The unit cost of
iron sponge is »0.25 $/kg [203].

PSeveral commercial iron oxide media are also available such as
SulfaTreat(cid:1), Sulfur-Rite(cid:1), and Media-G2(cid:1). As also for iron sponge,
the main drawback of this type of material is the cost associated
with the disposal of the spent catalyst (that can be classified as

Phazardous waste). Sulfatreat is currently one of the most used scav-
engers for H2S removal. Sulfatreat consists of iron oxides (Fe2O3,
Fe3O4) mixed with an activator oxide that are deposited on a cal-
cined montmorillonite carrier matrix; the latter is thought to be
enhancing catalytically the reactive adsorption phenomenon [204].
According to the manufacturer, the activator is made of one or more
oxides of a group of metals consisting of platinum, gold, silver,
copper, cadmium, nickel, palladium, lead, mercury, tin and cobalt.
The amount of activator is 0.125(cid:1)5%w/w of the adsorbent [204].

PSulfatreat adsorbent requires 100% water-saturated gas accord-
ing to the vendor's website (Schlumberger, US); the role of water
might be either that of catalyst or reactant [204]. Truong and Abatzo-
glou [204] derived a kinetic model from their experiments on Sulfa-
treat suggesting that the reaction is close to first order with respect
to the H2S concentration and zero order with respect to the media (i.
e., the number of active sites per cm3 of adsorbent). The role of water
was not clearly identified.

PExperiments from Truong and Abatzoglou [204] have shown that
1 g of Sulfatreat adsorbent can adsorb up to 0.11 g of H2S (sulfur
capacity of 11 wt. %). The saturation was defined experimentally as
the point at which the concentrations of the inlet and outlet gas in
H2S were identical. Papadias et al. [70] developed a model of H2S
adsorption on Sulfatreat and calculated a sulfur capacity up to
6.7 wt. % with an inlet concentration of 150 ppm(v) of H2S, and a
breakthrough concentration set at 10 ppm(v).

PActivated carbons (AC) are widely employed for both air purifica-
tion (odor control) as well as biogas clean up. The main distinction is
between impregnated AC and non-impregnated ones [205]. Impreg-
nated AC is treated with a solid or liquid chemical in order to
improve the chemical sorption of H2S. The main impregnating
compounds are sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3), sodium carbonate
(Na2CO3), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), potassium hydroxide (KOH),
potassium iodide (KI) and potassium permanganate (KMnO4) [197].
Impregnated AC has a sulfur capacity as high as 30 wt. % (i.e., 300 g
H2S/kg of adsorbent) under aerobic conditions. In the absence of
oxygen, the sulfur capacity is dramatically decreased to values only
slightly above those of non-impregnated activated carbons [206].
The presence of water is a crucial factor enhancing hydrogen sulfide
adsorption. In fact, it enables the dissociation of H2S to HS¡ ions
when the pH allows [207] (a basic pH is needed to promote the for-
mation of HS¡ ions). The surface pH of the AC is also a relevant
parameter. Yan et al. have demonstrated how surface pH values of
the exhausted carbons show a clear trend of pH drop along the reac-
tion extent, while a pH around 2 was observed for the bottom of the
bed indicating sulfuric acid (H2SO4) as the predominant product
[208]. Having a large micro-pore volume is also important to store
the S [209] (either in the form of elemental sulfur or as sulfate, e.g.,
K2SO4 or Na2SO4). More details on the mechanisms of S-removal in
impregnated activated carbons in the presence of oxygen can be
found in the work of Bagreev and Bandosz [207]. Xiao et al. studied
the breakthrough capacity of both impregnated and non-impreg-
nated AC with and without oxygen addition to the simulated biogas
feed [205,206]. The results are summarized in Table 19. The results
clearly show that H2S is removed by both adsorption and catalytic
oxidation over the AC and IAC at nearly ambient temperature.

under aerobic conditions (mg g¡1)

PCatalytic oxidation accounts for the most part of the sulfur
capacity in impregnated carbon, increasing the sulfur capacity
dramatically. Guti(cid:1)errez Ortiz et al. [210] have also investigated
the adsorption capacity of AC (with or without impregnation) as
well as in-house adsorbents for which sewage sludge was used
as a precursor. The sludge was thermally treated with either N2/
air or air only, in order to activate it. Experiments were carried
out at 20°C, using a simulated biogas mixture and an inlet H2S
concentration of 2000 ppm(v) (the breakthrough was set to an
outlet concentration of 200 ppm(v) of H2S). The adsorption
capacity of fresh AC and NaOH-impregnated AC were measured
as 4.4 and 12.7 mg g¡1, respectively. Under aerobic conditions
(5% vol. O2), the sulfur capacity of AC and IAC increased to 7.3
and 77.4, mg g¡1 respectively. The highest adsorption capacity of
sludge-derived adsorbent was measured as 8.6 mg g¡1 under
anaerobic conditions, and 17.3 mg g¡1 under aerobic conditions.
No further improvement was observed by impregnation of the
sludge-derived adsorbent.

PActivated carbons are often adopted as the guard bed (or pol-
isher) for the SOFC [93,211]. The main properties of activated carbon
filters for the effective removal of VOCs are high porosity, high
superficial area (1500 m2 g¡1), high volume, pore distribution [212]
and treatment with metal ions.

PTo summarize, impregnated activated carbons, mainly impreg-
nated with caustic bases (NaOH, Na2CO3, NaHCO3, KI), show typical
H2S loading capacities in the range of a few hundreds of mg per g of
activated carbon. Especially, the presence of oxygen is key to achieve
high sulfur capacity (as it will be explained in more detail at the end
of this chapter, adding oxygen to the desulfurizer beds is required to
promote H2S oxidation to elemental sulfur, which then remains
trapped in the AC micro-pore volume). The non-impregnated AC
achieves H2S removal capacities one order of magnitude lower than
IAC on average. Again, the presence of oxygen is enhancing the sulfur
capacity.

PDigester gas typically contains from 0.1 to 2(cid:1)3 vol. % of O2, so
employing IAC should be beneficial as their removal capacity can be
exploited thus justifying the higher cost (typically, the adsorbent
unit cost for IAC is 3(cid:1)4 times higher than virgin AC). According to
Seredych and Bandosz [209], the degree of humidification has an
impact on the removal capacity of AC. The best performance is
obtained with pre-humidified (saturated) AC then fed with mois-
ture-free biogas. In fact, in the presence of moist gas, H2S is first oxi-
dized to SO2 and then to sulfurous acid (H2SO3). The acid reacts with
alkali or alkaline earth metals to form sulfites thus rapidly depleting
active sites. With a pre-saturated bed, H2S instead interacts with the
water film formed on the carbon surface to form HS¡ that are even-
tually converted to elemental sulfur (and/or sulfates) that is stored
in the micropore volume.

PConcerning the layout of the clean-up unit in order to ensure the
SOFC fuel quality requirements, the recommended configuration is
to have first a bulk removal stage of harmful compounds, which
should be followed by one or more adsorption beds able to either
simultaneously or selectively capture the remainder of the contami-
nants down to ppb(v) levels. Bulk sulfur removal could be accom-
plished by an absorption process or by an iron oxide bed, while the
ultra-filtration process is most effectively carried out by using solid
adsorbents, such as activated carbons.

PFinally, the determination of the breakthrough time of the sor-
bent material is important to determine when the sorbent material
must be changed, thus minimizing operating costs of the plant.

PWhenever reporting sulfur (or any other contaminant) removal
capacity for a given adsorbent material, it is important to state the
breakthrough concentration used to calculate the integral of the
adsorption curve. Especially, the threshold (breakthrough) concen-
tration is set quite arbitrarily in scientific works reviewed in this
work. The formula to calculate the breakthrough time ts (s) is the

PThe adsorption capacity ( x

M, mg of contaminant g¡1 of AC) is
thus calculated based on the inlet volumetric flow rate of biogas,
_
Q (Nm3 s¡1), the adsorbent weight, w (g), the contaminant molecular
weight, Mw (g mol¡1), the inlet concentration of contaminant in the
feed stream, C0 (ppm(v) by volume) and the (breakthrough) contam-
inant concentration at the reactor outlet at a given time, C(t).

PThe breakthrough capacity thus expresses the threshold capacity
above which the loaded sorbent must be replaced with a fresh sor-
bent, or regenerated. As mentioned earlier, in some works the sulfur
capacity is calculated taking as breakthrough capacity the initial
concentration of contaminant in the gas feed (i.e., when C(t) equals
C0. Under this assumption, the calculated capacity of the sorbent is
the highest. However, it is also quite common to have the break-
through concentration set as a fraction of the inlet concentration (e.
g., 10% or 1% of C0). Lower removal adsorbent capacities are thus cal-
culated depending on the choice made.

PThe (correct) definition of the breakthrough capacity depends on
the downstream process and the reactor configuration. In the lead-
and-lag configuration, the first adsorption vessel (lead reactor) is fol-
lowed by a second one (lag reactor). In this way, the lifetime of the
catalyst can be extended while assuring a stringent removal. For fuel
cell applications, very high fuel quality is required with sub-ppm(v)
levels of H2S. Therefore, the overall breakthrough concentration
should be set as low as 1% of the inlet concentration (or even lower,
depending on the minimum detection limit of the gas analyzer).
Using a single reactor configuration would not be ideal as the break-
through concentration shall be achieved relatively fast. With a lead-
and-lag configuration instead (described in detail later), the break-
through concentration in the first reactor (lead) can be exceeded, as
long as the breakthrough limit is not reached after the lag reactor.

P6.1.2. Sulfur removal (for non-H2S compounds)

PThe removal of H2S on solid sorbent materials can be very effec-
tive. However, when the presence of non-H2S sulfur compounds is

Phigh, the risk of a sulfur breakthrough from the sorbent trap might
be relevant since some organic sulfur species are not effectively
removed with sorbents. Non-H2S sulfur compounds commonly
found in biogas include mercaptanes (e.g., CH4S and C2H6S), Car-
bonyl Sulfide (COS) and Carbon Disulfide (CS2). An effective method
to remove all the sulfur present in the biogas is hydro-desulfuriza-
tion (HDS), which is an already proven technology widely used in
large-scale chemical and refining industries. The HDS technique
allows converting all the above-mentioned organic sulfur com-
pounds into H2S, which is more readily adsorbed on activated car-
bons and other sorbent materials. The same technique is also used to
convert halogenated compounds and halocarbons to HCl.

PThe catalytic shift occurs in the temperature range of 300(cid:1)400°C
on catalysts such as Ni-Mo or Co-Mo supported on alumina, and in
the presence of H2 [70,213]. HDS makes effective the subsequent
clean-up stage, which will have to deal with H2S only. However,
integrating HDS into a stationary fuel cell system is challenging since
the process needs hydrogen for efficient operation, which is not
readily available for clean(cid:1)up systems in most of the cases. The
anode off-gas of high-temperature fuel cells contains H2. Thus, in
principle, the recycle of some anode exhaust gas to the HDS could be
used. However, hydrogen would not be available during the plant
start-up and shut-down. Hence, bottled hydrogen gas should be
available on-site anyway. He et al. [213] first studied the field appli-
cation of a hybrid clean-up system for fuel cell quality landfill biogas
purification. Stable performance was observed for the tests con-
ducted at 340°C on a Ni-Mo catalyst from Haldor-Topsøe (TK-525,
3(cid:1)5% NiO, 15(cid:1)25% MoO3, 65(cid:1)75% Al2O3, 5(cid:1)10% SiO2) and a Co-Mo
catalyst from United Catalyst Inc. (C20-6-03, with a manufacturer's
reported composition of 80(cid:1)90% Al2O3, 1(cid:1)5% CoO, and 10(cid:1)15%
MoO3). More details on the catalyst system provided by Haldor-
Topsøe can be found in the work of Lauritsen et al. [214] (Fig. 20).

PPapadias et al. [70] have analysed the techno-economic perfor-
mance of a clean-up configuration of the type proposed in the work
of He et al. [213]. The detailed system configuration is shown in
Fig. 21. The biogas is initially treated in a vessel filled with iron
oxides and activated carbons for bulk sulfur removal; this vessel is
contained included within the gas purification unit (GPU) shown in

Fig. 21. Biogas clean-up configuration with HDS treatment for a MCFC plant (reprinted with permission from Ref. [70]).

PFig. 21. The GPU also includes a chiller with a dew point around 0°C
to remove moisture in the biogas followed by a low-temperature
polisher comprising of a series of vessels containing various adsorb-
ents (i.e., activated carbon, silica, zeolites) that removes organic
sulfur, siloxanes, and halogens. The pre-cleaned fuel gas is then com-
pressed to 0.7 bar(g) and fed to the HDS module for the trace
removal of sulfur and halogenated compounds. The HDS module is
integrated downstream with a hot guard bed for HCl removal and a
hot trap made of ZnO for H2S removal. The hydrogen needed for the
HDS is obtained by recycling a slip-stream (6%) from the anode tail
gas. This anode slip-stream is first cooled to 60°C, to condense out
most of the water vapor and increase the hydrogen concentration,
before mixing it with biogas from the GPU.

PA first attempt to integrate HDS technology with a phosphoric
acid fuel cell (PAFC) plant has been reported by Spiegel and Preston
[215]. The 200 kWe fuel cell was fed with AD biogas from a waste-
water treatment (Yonkers, NY (cid:1) US). The overall clean-up layout
closely resembled that found in Refs. [70,213]. A first array of fixed
beds filled with non-regenerable KOH-impregnated activated car-
bons was used for the bulk sulfur removal. Oxygen was added to
the desulfurizer beds to about 0.3(cid:1)0.5 vol. % in order to promote
the Claus reactions (i.e., H2S oxidation to elemental sulfur, which
remains trapped in the AC micro-pore volume). The pretreated gas
was then fed to a fuel preprocessing unit placed inside the fuel cell
module. To aid the removal of contaminants within the fuel prepro-
cessor, a small portion of the H2 produced by the downstream shift
converter is recirculated back to the fuel preprocessor to promote
the hydrogenation of sulfur and halide compounds. A hot ZnO bed is
then used for H2S removal, while an additional vessel with a metal
oxide supported on alumina was used to remove hydrogenated
halides. The above-described configuration has been successfully
employed to extend the lifetime of the Ni-based reformer to
40,000(cid:1)50,000 operating hours. Further information on the field-
application and operational results of the above-described biogas
clean-up system can be found in Ref. [216].

PRecently, HDS has been successfully used in the 250 kWe biogas-
fed fuel cell plant installed in the Orange County Sanitation District
(OCSD). The plant uses MCFC technology and is operated in a tri-
generation configuration to co-produce electricity, heat and H2 from
a single biogas stream [50]. Most of the produced hydrogen serves a
nearby H2 refueling station for road mobility, while only a fraction of
it feeds the HDS module.

P6.1.3. Siloxanes removal

PSiloxanes can also be effectively removed by solid sorbents
through adsorption. The concentration of siloxanes in biogas is such
that cooling processes usually employed to remove moisture are
scarcely affecting the vapor concentration of siloxanes in the gas
phase as condensation is almost negligible even for the heavier
organic silicon compounds (e.g., D5) [63].

PActivated carbons are very effective for the removal of siloxanes.
Cabrera et al. [217] have studied 12 commercial AC against D4-
siloxane. The best performance was achieved by a wood-based
chemically activated carbon, which achieved an adsorption capacity
of 1732 § 93 mg/g using 1000 ppm(v) (v/v) of D4 with dry N2 as a
carrier gas. The D4 adsorption capacities were strongly related to
the textural features of the ACs with a positive correlation between
adsorption capacity and the total pore volume. For each adsorption
experiment, the adsorption column was operated until the D4
outlet concentration matched the inlet concentration (i.e., full
bed saturation).

PSilica gel is also quite effective in removing siloxanes, with an
observed adsorption capacity exceeding 100 mg g¡1 and possibility
of regeneration (a great advantage over AC which cannot be effec-
tively regenerated) [63].

PAccording to experiments carried out by Matsui and Imamura
[218], the adsorption capacity is 5.6(cid:1)19.2 mg g¡1 for the activated
carbons, 4(cid:1)77 mg g¡1 for the molecular sieve and 104 mg g¡1 for the
silica gel. All tests were conducted using D4 as model siloxane com-
pound and using N2 gas as a carrier gas.

PSince biogas contains a variety of harmful compounds (vapors),
having concentrations spanning several orders of magnitude, com-
petitive adsorption occurs in the solid sorbent. This is especially
true for siloxanes. In fact, the presence of relatively non-volatile,
organic sulfur or halogenated compounds, can greatly reduce the
adsorption capacity towards siloxanes [219]. Other factors influenc-
ing the silicon capacity of activated carbon are the relative concen-
trations of the siloxane species to one another (e.g., L2 breaks
through sooner than D5), temperature and relative humidity [220].
According to Wheless and Pierce [220], who monitored the removal
of siloxane in landfill biogas, not only L2 was the quickest com-
pound to break through, but it could be found at a higher concen-
tration than in the inlet gas since accumulated siloxanes were then
released. This phenomenon is known as ‘roll-up’ and it involves the
desorption of the weaker adsorbates in downstream zones which
are replaced by more strongly adsorbed compounds [75]. This phe-
nomenon can lead to concentration peaks at the outlet of the vessel
that are even larger than the inlet concentration, or it can explain
the early breakthrough of the weaker compound. For instance, in
the biogas clean-up plant analyzed by de Arespacochaga et al. [75],
D4 was the first silicon compound to break through despite the
higher amount of D5 in the inlet feed. In the same work, the mea-
sured siloxanes adsorption capacity was 5 mg g¡1 on extruded acti-
vated carbons. The low removal capacity might be due to the low
inlet concentration of siloxanes (which can strongly reduce the
equilibrium adsorption capacity according to a Langmuir-type
adsorption process or Freundlich adsorption isotherm) and compet-
itive adsorption phenomena.

PRicaurte Ortega and Subrenat [221] tested different porous mate-
rials to measure their adsorption capacity toward L2 and D4 silox-
anes. The materials tested were activated carbon cloths, granular
activated carbon, zeolite, and silica gel. Activated carbons reached a
L2 removal capacity around 300(cid:1)350 mg g¡1, while zeolite and silica
reached values around 100(cid:1)150 mg g¡1 (the lower performance of
zeolite and silica is linked to their lower surface area compared to
AC). All tests were performed in air. Similar but slightly higher
removal capacity holds for D4. Reducing temperature is confirmed
to enhance the adsorption process according to experiments. It is
worth noting the trend of the adsorption isotherm with varying inlet
siloxane concentration in the experiments [221]; as the inlet con-
centration of siloxane in the feed gas gets lower, a much-reduced
removal capacity is observed. Experimental isotherm curves were
well fitted by a Freundlich isotherm model. This consideration is
important because, in realistic applications, the overall siloxane con-
centration is often quite low (< than 50 mg/Nm3). Therefore the
adsorption capacity of the adsorbent medium reduces several times
compared to values that are reached when high inlet siloxane con-
centrations are tested. Hence, in order to avoid an over-estimation
of the adsorption capacity of a given sorbent, it is recommendable to
test the siloxane removal of an adsorbent at concentrations close to
those of real biogases [219].

P6.1.4. Other VOCs removal

PThe most relevant volatile contaminants contained in biogenous
fuels are sulfur, aromatic, carbonyl and chloro-compounds [222] and
siloxanes; these groups are derived from the starting biomass loaded
into the digester [222]. Studies on the effective removal of all VOCs
in order to produce highly pure, fuel cell-grade biogas are rare, as
the main focus is on H2S or sulfur compound removal only
[223,224]. Typically the effect that different VOCs have on each oth-
er's removal rate is overlooked. Part of the problem is related to the

Pdetection of VOCs, as a fast method with a low limit of detection has
to be used. An electrochemical gas sensor is usually adopted to mon-
itor online and real-time H2S [225]. A GC(cid:1)MS instrument is instead
used to detect the other compounds [75,225], however, acquisition
time is much prolonged in this case. Hence, for the monitoring of
biogas trace compounds (cid:1) especially for real biogases that have a
rather complex matrix of contaminants (cid:1)there is a need for more
sensitive and robust methods for real-time online analysis. In this
context, Direct Injection Mass Spectrometry (DIMS) was proven to
have good performances in term of rapidity, sensitivity, and
absence of pre-treatments [226]. One of the most promising DIMS
techniques is the Proton Transfer Reaction-Mass Spectrometry
(PTR-MS) [226]. This method is based on an efficient implementa-
tion of chemical ionization based on proton transfer from hydro-
nium ions and allows the rapid and on-line monitoring of most
volatile compounds. It has been applied in many situations ranging
from breath analysis to environmental monitoring and, recently,
also to issues related to waste management and odorant emission
control [93,227].

PAs reported by Papurello et al. [211], the breakthrough time is

affected, among other factors, by (in order of importance):

P- the type of sulfur compounds that must be removed;
P- the GHSV of the mixture gas across the adsorbent bed;
P- the presence of co-vapors of organic compounds besides sulfur

compounds.

PIt was demonstrated that even only 1 ppm(v) of aromatic, car-
bonyl and chloro-compounds could reduce the removal efficiency
performance by 70% in case of sulfur compounds only [211]. There-
fore, real-biogas experiments should follow lab-experiments to ver-
ify fully the adsorbent performance in the context of a more
complex matrix of contaminants, which also contains several VOCs
at either ppm or ppb levels besides the main contaminant types (e.
g., H2S and s D4-D5 siloxanes for sewage biogas).

6.2. Experimental methods for adsorption experiments

PThe typical experimental apparatus to test activated carbons for
the removal of biogas contaminants is described in this paragraph.
The set-up consists of a few centimeters long cartridge made either

Pof Teflon tube (PTFE) or quartz (for high temperature experiments)
in which the sorbent material is placed. A sterile gauze, or other
inert filling body, is used to avoid dragging phenomena by the gas
stream. The main factors affecting the removal efficiency of the sor-
bent material are the moisture in the gas feed, the operating tem-
perature, and the gas hourly space velocity (GHSV). The sorbent
materials are usually tested with inert gas or simulated biogas
(CH4 and CO2) while varying the inlet contaminant concentration.
Known concentrations of pollutants are fed using certified gas cyl-
inders [211,225,228] or permeation tubes [229,230]. A liquid mass
flow controller and a controlled evaporator mixer generally control
the flow rate of demineralized water (which is then vaporized) to
deliver a controlled level of moisture in the gas stream. Fig. 22
shows a typical experimental set-up for testing the adsorption
capacity of a solid sorbent: the red color represents the heated
lines with heater strings controlled via a PID regulator. A PolyDi-
MethylSiloxane (20 mm) membrane filter is inserted between the
filter line and the detection instrument in order to avoid obstruc-
tions from particles dragging. In order to maintain a given ratio
between the particle diameter of the sorbent material and the
actual reactor diameter, the sorbent materials are grounded and
then with a vibratory sieve shaker sieved to a certain particle
range.

P6.2.1. Equilibrium adsorption isotherms

PEquilibrium adsorption isotherms describe the adsorption pro-
cess of the contaminant on the solid sorbent surface. In this section,
we review the main adsorption isotherm equations usually
employed in the literature.

PAdsorption is described through a function that connects the
amount of adsorbate taken up by the adsorbent to the adsorbate
concentration in the gas phase. Such a function is called isotherm
under specific conditions. These conditions are isothermal and
atmospheric pressure under steady state conditions. The general
expression of an adsorption isotherm is the following:
qmax 1⁄4 f C(cid:5)ð

ð27Þ
PWhen the contaminants concentration typically does not exceed
a few parts per billion even a linear correlation between qmax and C*
can be adopted [232]. qmax is the maximum adsorption capacity
function of a given couple sorbent material - contaminant (mg g¡1)

PMonolayer molecular adsorption occurs in micropores of solids,
which has pore sizes not much greater than the adsorbate molecule
size. Thus, the adsorption maximum capacity of a given sorbent is
governed by the accessible micropore volume.

P6.2.2. Adsorption reactor model

PThe following section describes the assumptions and equations
used to evaluate the adsorption of selected contaminants on an acti-
vated carbon trap (reactor). A porous particle diffusion model is
used, which involves the material balance equations in both the gas-
phase and the pore phase [212]. The model adopted is comprised of
the mass balance equation for the bulk phase in a packed bed, the
mass balance equation within the particle, the isotherm equation to
describe adsorption capacity of material, and the ideal adsorption
solution theory to consider the competitive adsorption. Several
assumptions were made to build the model:

P1. the adsorption process is isothermal;
P2. the axial dispersion is considered only longitudinally and not

radially;

P3. the adsorbent particles are spherical and homogeneous in size

and density;

P4. the external transfer coefficient depicts the mass transfer across

the boundary layer;

P5. the intra-particle mass transport is characterized by the effec-

tive pore diffusion coefficient;

P6. the linear velocity of the gas phase is independent by the

concentration;

P7. a local equilibrium condition is established between the gas

concentration adsorbed and the solid particle.

PThe equation of the model

is a partial differential equation
in space and time, which was also proposed by Rosen [238] and
Rasmuson [239].

PThe axial dispersion term becomes negligible under certain
fluid flow conditions. In fact, the contribution of this term can be
neglected when the Peclet number is below 500, which is generally
attained by the gas flow across the adsorbent media. By neglecting
the diffusion term from the axial dispersion, the solution of the
equation is strongly simplified.
PThe accumulation term,

, takes into account the mass trans-
fer of the contaminant from bulk gas phase to solid phase. It repre-
sents the rate of adsorption, and it contains the transport kinetics of
the contaminants. These conditions are related to the type of iso-
therm chosen and related coefficients. The necessity to know the
porous media characteristics is crucial to developing a mass balance
within the particle. This term can be written as follows:

PThe boundary layer mass transfer coefficient, kfk, for packed bed
can be calculated using the empirical formulation by Wakao-Funaz-
kri [240] (see also Xiao et al. [205] for a recent application of this cor-
relation). To obtain the rate of adsorption and to complete the
equation, it is also necessary to evaluate the term C*. This term
expresses the gas concentration that is obtained once the equilib-
rium capacity, qmax has been reached. The evaluation of this parame-
ter is obtained using the Langmuir isotherm [241] or one of the
other isotherm equations provided in Table 20.

P6.2.3. Multicomponent competitive adsorption

PIn most practical adsorption processes, a mixture of vapors
comprises the adsorbed gas and therefore a multi-component
adsorption phenomenon must be dealt with. As previously
described, the species in the mixture having the higher adsorp-
tion capacity with regard to a specific adsorbent material may
displace from the micro-pore volume the weakly adsorbed
adsorbates thus modifying the breakthrough time of the system.
This is the so-called roll-up phenomenon. Measurements of the
adsorption capacities of multiple-component mixtures are there-
fore much more complex than for a single adsorbate, and the
possibility of predicting multicomponent adsorption equilibria
from pure component adsorption isotherms has been under
investigation for many years in applied adsorption research.
Therefore, extensions of several common single component iso-
therms were studied to model and approximate the entire phe-
the most known and used in the
nomenon. Among them,
literature is the Extended Langmuir Isotherm Equation.

PThe Extended Langmuir Isotherm (ELI) was first proposed by
Markham and Benton [242]. This was the first attempt to develop a
multicomponent adsorption model. According to this model, the
equilibrium adsorption capacity of the i-vapor within the multi-
component mixture also depends on all the Langmuir coefficients
and concentrations of the other vapor species present in the mixture.

where the terms qm,i and ki correspond to the pure gas Langmuir iso-
therm constants for component i. It is worth mentioning that the ELI
model is not thermodynamically consistent, unless the values of qm
are the same for all components in a gas mixture [243,244].

PA thermodynamically consistent approach was later proposed by
Myers and Prausnitz [245], who developed the Ideal Adsorbed Solu-
tion (IAS) theory to evaluate the isothermal adsorption capacity for a
multi-component gas mixture. The IAS theory assumes that the
Gibbs free energy definition also applies to the adsorbed phase. The
IAS approach comes as an analogy of Raoult's law for vapor-liquid
equilibria applied to the multi-phase ‘gas-adsorbate’ phase’ system.
The fundamental relation of the IAS model is:
Pyi 1⁄4 PB
where P is the total pressure in the gas mixture, yi is the gas molar
fraction, PB
ðpÞ is the equilibrium gas-phase pressure at the given
i
solution temperature corresponding to the solution spreading pres-
sure p for the adsorption of the pure component i (the spreading
pressure is the same concept as pressure simply transposed into a
two-dimensional environment).

PRecently, Simon et al. [246] developed a computer program that
solves the system of non-linear equations that derives from the
application of the IAS theory to a multicomponent gas mixture.

6.3. Typical gas clean-up configurations

ð37Þ

PThere are essentially three different gas clean-up configurations
that are plausible for the gas treatment for SOFC applications: series,
parallel and lead-and-lag (Figs. 23(cid:1)25). For each configuration it is
assumed that two identical columns of the same size are available.

P6.3.1. Series configuration

PFor the series configuration, at least two columns are adopted.
These columns increase the redundancy of the systems. The spent
media is replaced simultaneously in both vessels once the effluent
reaches the target breakthrough concentration. This configuration
causes a plant stoppage that generates management issues.

P6.3.2. Parallel configuration

PTwo columns of the same size with staggered replacement
were used to represent a parallel configuration. While in the
“series” scheme, all columns are replaced simultaneously,
for
is staggered to allow
the replacement
parallel arrangement
blending of the effluent from a newly replaced column and an
old column. This approach was shown to reduce the adsorbent

Pusage rate in many cases [248,249]. This configuration does not
cause any plant stoppage. However, the parallel configuration
brings no guarantee of a breakthrough prevention in the case of
a sudden heavy load of contaminants at the bed inlet. A more
robust design is provided by the following configuration (lead-
and-lag), which can tolerate better peak concentrations of one or
more contaminants.

P6.3.3. Lead-and-lag configuration

PFor the lead-and-lag configuration, two columns of the same
size are also used. One column is placed in a “lead” position,
while the other one serves as a “lag” or “guard” column. A sam-
ple breakthrough curve for two columns placed in a lead-lag is
shown in Fig. 26. The system continues operation until the efflu-
ent from the lag column reaches the target concentration. Then,
the saturated Column 1 (left) is taken out of operation, and Col-
umn 2 (right) is put online as the new “lead”. The replaced, fresh
Column 1 is installed in a “lag” position, providing polishing for
the effluent
from Column 2. The lead-and-lag configuration
allows for continuous plant operation while also providing the
extra adsorbent capacity to account for variations in operating
conditions (such as temperature and the inlet concentration of
the contaminant).

6.4. Examples of adsorption curves on activated carbons

PAdsorption curves for typically encountered commercial acti-

vated carbons for the removal of H2S are reviewed in this section.

PThe pass through ratio (C/C0) is generally used to describe the
pollutant removal with sorbent materials, where C is the gas
bulk concentration and C0 the initial concentration, both in ppm
(v). For fuel cell applications, this value was fixed at 1% and 10%
in order to identify two reference concentration levels [59].
These two concentration levels were adopted to describe the
nominal concentration and a maximum concentration level suit-
able for SOFC application, considering a biogas coming from
WWTPs were generally the H2S level ranged from 60 to 200 ppm
(v). These values represent the reversible pollutant concentration
for SOFC applications, as reported elsewhere [142,195,250]. In
the meantime, the pass through ratio at 10% can only generate
irreversible issues for SOFCs.

PPapurello et al. studied the performance of the Airdep Carbox AC
for fuel cell applications [251]. This material is an extruded activated
carbon, activated with steam and impregnated with several metal
(hydr)oxides (mainly MgO, KOH, and CaOH). A breakthrough time tb
of 107 min for C/C0 D 1% was observed (Fig. 26). At the 10% level of
C/C0, the tb was 111 min. Looking at the curve in Fig. 26, we observe
how the saturation level is reached soon after the initial break-
through at C/C0 D 1%.

PPapurello et al. [231] showed how the breakthrough time
decreased when the initial concentration of
the contaminant
increases. By reducing the operating temperature from 45°C to 5°C,
the removal performance of commercial carbons was improved
[231]. Water vapor contained in the biogas was pre-adsorbed on the
carbon that enters in competition with the organic vapor that has to
be removed. This might result in a loss of adsorption capacity as well
as a decreasing rate of adsorption. In fact, an RH value around 20% at
30°C is still tolerable; here the adsorption capacity for two different
commercial carbons was around 5 mg g¡1 [231]. On the contrary,
when the relative humidity value was above 50%, the adsorption
capacity was close to zero [231].

PGenerally, sorbent materials face the contemporary presence
of more than one contaminant [211]. The phenomenon that
might occur during the removal of more than one trace com-
pound is called roll-up [252,253]. Fig. 27 provides an example of
the roll-up phenomenon; the graph shows the breakthrough for
two different contaminants, namely C1 (H2S) and C2 (HCl) that
are both present in the inlet biogas stream. The simultaneous
presence of two (or more) vapors reduces the breakthrough time
that each contaminant would reach if present alone in the feed.
The reduced breakthrough time (tb) is because each vapor wave
front moves faster (compared to the case with only one contami-
nant) through the bed as the two vapors compete for the same
adsorption volume. Hence,
the less strongly and previously
adsorbed vapor will be partially displaced by the other, which
might even result in a concentration at the exit gas of the previ-
ously adsorbed contaminant higher than the inlet value.
In
Fig. 27, we observe how C2 first eluted after 64 min of continu-
ous gas feeding, while C1 kept occupying free sites of the carbon
for a longer time. This was due to the higher adsorption capacity
at saturation of C1 (391 mg g¡1) compared to C2 (238 mg g¡1)
(these values were measured in single-contaminant experi-
ments). At 169 min, C2 reached its maximum pass-through ratio
value (105%); an outlet concentration higher than the inlet is
possible since C1 vapor displaces part of the previously adsorbed
C2 vapor. Gradually, C1 reaches the saturation condition of the
carbon filter bed (i.e., the pass-through ratio is 100%). By the
time C1 reaches saturation, C2 also approaches 100% of bed satu-
ration.

PConsidering a more realistic case, in which the biogas from an
anaerobic digester is filtered by either commercial or innovative
materials, the adsorption capacities for H2S at 1% were measured
respectively as 1.8 mg g¡1 for activated carbons [228], 0.068 mg g¡1
for ashes [255] and 1.05 mg g¡1 for biochar [254].

PSisani et al. [225] studied the efficiency of H2S removal of H2S
under simulated biogas flow conditions for different solid sorbents.
They tested several commercial types of sorbents including steam

Pactivated carbons, either without impregnation, or with KOH, or Cu
and Cr salts impregnation, activated alumina and zeolite. These
materials are all good candidates, in principle, to reduce the sulfur
level to ultra-low levels as required by the fuel cell.

PResults are summarized in Table 21. It is worth noting how natu-
ral sorbents show extremely poor performance, mostly related to
their almost negligible micropore volume compared to activated
materials. Finally, impregnation is confirmed to be a notable boost
for the removal of H2S. This is true not only for AC, but also when
alumina is used as support (see Table 18).

PThe adsorption curves for the different solid sorbents tested by
Sisani et al. [225] are shown in Fig. 28. It is worth noting how the
curve becomes quite steep at breakthrough. In fact, as soon as the
H2S is detected in the outlet gas, its concentration typically increases
fast over time.

PExperiments on sorbent materials are often conducted in dry
anaerobic conditions. However, it was previously stated how gas

Phumidity and the presence of oxygen in the biogas stream could
drastically affect the removal efficiency of the tested material. Sitthi-
khankaew et al. [256] systematically studied the effect of humidity,
O2, and CO2 on the adsorption of H2S on both AC and IAC. Results are
summarized in Table 22. As expected, the presence of O2 comes with
a marked increase in the adsorption capacity of the AC. The presence
of CO2 in dry inert gas further reduces the removal capacity com-
pared to inert gas only; this is due to the competitive adsorption of
CO2 on the active carbon sites. Finally, the gas humidity is strongly
enhancing the overall adsorption capacity of the sorbent. However,
looking at breakthrough curves in Fig. 29, we observe how the mois-
turized gas is not able to remove H2S entirely as in the case of oxygen
presence. On the one hand, the overall sulfur capacity of the sorbent
is augmented by the presence of moisture; on the other hand, sulfur
is not completely removed. Hence, for fuel cell applications (cid:1) for
which ultra-low levels of H2S must be produced by the clean-up
system (cid:1) the presence of moisture might be detrimental since a full

Premoval of H2S is required. In a two- or multiple-reactor configura-
tion and for biogas with a high H2S concentration, the presence of
moisture in the first reactor(s) might be favorable for an initial H2S
abatement. However, the following stages should foresee a dry gas
for a complete sulfur removal. Finally, the simultaneous presence of
humidity and oxygen provides the best performance (Fig. 29). In the
presence of moisture, sulfur removal is enhanced as the adsorbed
H2S dissolves in the water film forming HS ¡ and H + .

PHydrogen sulfide is oxidized on basic centers of alkali earth metal
oxides and sulfur is formed [209]. The last two reactions show how
KOH is regenerated with O2 thus leaving elemental sulfur behind.
Oxygen is thus fundamental to restore the catalytic activity of the
impregnated AC. KOH can also react with H2S to form potassium
sulfate (see reaction below).

7. Discussion: guidelines for dealing with fuel contaminants

7.1. Recommendations for the design of the clean-up unit

PThis section provides general recommendations for the design of
the clean-up unit (see Table 23). Depending on the type and amount
of contaminants found in the raw biogas, different techniques may
be available. Hence, a “universal” clean-up system that can handle
different biogas types seems a difficult target to reach. The design of
the clean-up unit for a high-temperature fuel cell generator should
be thus tailored to each specific application (e.g., integrated biogas
fuel cell plants in WWPTs).

PFurther advances in the materials science of adsorption systems
could bring novel solutions for the cost-effective ultra-purification
of biogas with a reduced reactors’ volume. Metal-organic

Pframeworks hybrids filled with graphene layers have been identified
recently as possible candidates to reach exceptionally high adsorp-
tion capacities [257]. To promote adsorption, a large surface area is
required that must be accessible via the porous network of the sor-
bent material. By filling the MOF structure (MOF-5 was used in the
work of Petit and Bandosz [257]) (cid:1) which has a high porosity (cid:1) with
graphene layers of graphitic oxide (GO), a great synergy is estab-
lished between the GO (which enhances physical adsorption) and
the active sites provided by the MOF for heterogeneous reactions
(which promote reactive adsorption). Petit, Mendoza and Bandosz
[258] have tested the sorption capacity of composites of Cu-based
MOF and graphene. Measured sulfur capacities were up to »200 mg/
g for H2S (tests have been carried out with an inlet H2S concentration
of 1000 ppm). Sulfur reacts with the copper centers of the MOF and
with the carboxylate ligands of the MOF to form copper sulfide,
which is stored in the micropore volume of the composite material.
Physisorption also takes place in the composite material. Notably,
the composite materials have higher sulfur capacity than the parent
materials, thus confirming the synergetic effect of the MOF-GO com-
posite structure [258]. Recently, Ebrahim et al. [259] have tested the
effects of incorporating S- and N- in the MOF structure (the MO used
was Cu-BTC). The rationale behind this choice is that a high degree
of heterogeneity and defects in MOFs is beneficial for the adsorption
process. The doping of the MOF with S- and N- introduced the pres-
ence of sulfonic and heterocyclic organic species in the graphitic
layers, i.e., polar reactive groups with rich surface heterogeneity that
enhance the reactive adsorption of the composite material. The
highest sulfur capacity measured with this further functionalization
was over 200 mg/g (still with an inlet H2S concentration of
1000 ppm). Hence, MOFs based composites offer a great potential
for effective sulfur abatement even in conjunction with biogas
streams. Ebrahim, Jagiello and Bandosz have also reported the bene-
ficial role of moisture, which forms a liquid film on the adsorbent
material that promotes the dissolution and dissociation of H2S, while

7.2. Concluding remarks

PThe presence of contaminants in the fuel feed, even at ppm or
sub-ppm levels, can drastically reduce the performance and life-
time of the catalytic and electro-catalytic active surfaces encoun-
tered in high-temperature fuel cell systems (cells and reformer).
Alternative fuels that are different from natural gas, such as
landfill and anaerobic digestion biogases, contain a wide variety
of micro-contaminants found in different amounts depending on
the specific biomass or biowaste from which the biogas has been
produced.

PSulfur compounds (H2S and organic sulfur compounds) and
organic silicon compounds (siloxanes) are the most relevant and
critical contaminants when dealing with biogas. Therefore, we have
extensively reviewed the origin, typology and the amount of these
contaminants in different biogases in this work. Sulfur is mostly
present as H2S in biogas and, despite high concentrations (i.e., thou-
sands of ppm) can be found mainly in biogas from manure, food
waste or diary waste effluents; the average concentration is often
limited to a few tens of ppm in most of the cases (this is true espe-
cially for WWTP) thanks to in-situ abatement techniques that pre-
vent the sulfur from reaching the gas phase.

PSiloxanes are instead found almost exclusively in landfill and
sewage biogas. Often D4 and D5 compounds make most of the over-
all silicon amount in biogas. Siloxanes derive from human-made
products (such as detergents and cosmetics) that are discharged into
the sewer system.

PThe critical point of biogas contaminants is that they can affect
both the reformer of the fuel cell system (if present) and the fuel cell
anode electrode. In both cases, the effect of sulfur is a relatively fast
deactivation of the Ni active surface due sulfur coverage. Re-activa-
tion of the Ni surface is feasible at high temperature (800°C),
whereas at lower temperature a permanent degradation might be
established. Fuel cell system concerns regarding the presence of
siloxanes include a gradual accumulation of micro-silica deposits,
which is a non-reversible degradation process. Therefore, silicon
contamination in the fuel feed is very detrimental for the operation
of the fuel cell.

PTars and hydrocarbons (which are more abundant in bio-syngas
from biomass gasification, but they can be also found to a lower
extent into biogases) are generally dangerous since enhanced carbon
deposition is triggered by carbon species having C >1. Halogens are
not critical for the fuel cell electrode.

PTo provide a durable fuel cell system, a deep clean-up of the
incoming biogas stream is required. Solid oxide fuel cell systems
have been shown to be very sensitive to even trace amounts (ppb
levels) of selected contaminants. Hence, a dedicated biogas clean-up
upstream from the SOFC must be included in the design of any SOFC
system operating on biogas.

PAdsorption processes based on impregnated activated carbons
seem to be the most effective solution for biogas purification. Silox-
anes are easily removed reaching loading rates above 10 wt. % on
AC. Sulfur (H2S) is effectively removed in the presence of some oxy-
gen in the gas feed, which promotes its storage in the AC micropore
volume. For biogas feeds with a very high inlet H2S concentration,
in-situ abatement techniques (either biological or chemical routes)
should be applied. Otherwise, iron oxide based sorbents or acti-
vated carbons can be also employed (however, the frequent bed
replacement and its disposal might be critical from an economic
point of view). New trends in materials research indicate that MOFs
based composites might be soon commercially employed for biogas
purification. H2S removal rates up to 20 wt. % of the sorbent mate-
rial and above have been obtained already in laboratory experi-
ments. MOFs hybrid structures filled with graphene layers seem to
combine synergetically physisorption and reactive adsorption to
yield the highest sulfur capacity among all sorbent materials

Ppresent in the literature. MOF-based composites could then be used
either for bulk sulfur removal or as fine polishers. However, it
requires further research to study their interaction with the other
contaminants found in biogas.

PMaterial disposal is generally recognized as a major cost item
associated with biogas clean-up. In addition, the disposal of spent
sorbent media is both labor intensive and expensive. Some adsorb-
ents might even be classified as hazardous waste or flammable
material, thus requiring additional safety precautions and disposal
costs. Hence, further research should address environmental and
economic issues related with the disposal of spent sorbents. Sorbent
regeneration with sulfur recovery should thus be addressed in the
near future.

PIn the presence of non-H2S sulfur compounds, an additional pre-
processing (e.g., hydro-desulfurization) might be required before the
adsorption-based purification step on activated carbon to effectively
remove sulfur.

PSince most of the high temperature fuel cell systems employ
either a partial or full reforming of the inlet methane feed in
order to provide the fuel cell stack with an anode feed rich in H2
and CO, the reformer (which is often based on Ni catalyst) is the
first component that will suffer from fuel contamination. There-
fore, an early identification of the onset of deactivation of the
reformer might be used as proxy to avoid a more severe and
extended degradation of the fuel cell stacks (which are generally
more delicate and expensive). By monitoring the online outlet
composition of the reformer, early deactivation could be easily
identified and correlated to a malfunctioning of the upstream
clean-up system.

8. Conclusion

PBiogas is a renewable fuel that is currently exploited well below
the maximum potential. Biogas is available either as digester gas
from the anaerobic digestion of putrescible organic matter (cid:1) this is
often wet bio-waste (e.g., urban and/or industrial sludge from waste-
water treatment plants, manure, and food waste) or agricultural res-
idues (cid:1) or from landfills.

PHence, we first introduced the opportunities for biogas exploita-
tion in advanced high-temperature fuel cell systems and the com-
petitive advantages of fuel cells against conventional machines (e.g.,
ICEs) in terms of higher electrical conversion efficiency and reduced
emissions of CO2 and atmospheric pollutants. The appraisal of cur-
rent biogas production trends and the potential for further produc-
tion from different sources followed.

PWe have then extensively reviewed a range of topics connected
with the use of biogas in high-temperature fuel cells (both molten
carbonate fuel cells and solid oxide fuel cells). The focus was on the
biogas contaminants, which can degrade the fuel cell reformer and
state-of-the-art Ni anode. The origin, amount, and type of different
contaminants that might be found in biogases have been widely
reviewed showing how siloxanes are particularly relevant for sew-
age biogas. H2S and other organic sulfur compounds are found
instead at very high concentration in biogases from manure and
food waste, while halogenated compounds (as well as siloxanes)
are significant in landfill biogas. Advances in high-temperature fuel
cell science and technology could lead to alternative electrode
materials to the Ni-anode. Mahato et al. [6] have recently reviewed
advances in the field of SOFC materials. Possible alternatives to the
Ni-SOFC include the use of Cu-based electrodes, Ce-based electro-
des and Ni-free electrodes (e.g., perovskite and double-perovskite
structure based anodes), which can offer better tolerance to sulfur
and carbon deposition. In this work, we limited our attention to
state-of-the-art Ni cermets. However, it is worth mentioning that
the higher sulfur tolerance of newer anode electrode materials
would inevitably translate into higher SOx emissions in the tail gas

Pof the fuel cell generator. Hence, the deep sulfur removal which is
now required for Ni anode electrodes is not only beneficial for the
long-term stability of the fuel cell, but also to drastically cut the
emissions of the generator. This synergetic effect might be lost
when switching to sulfur tolerant anodes.

PProcesses and techniques for the removal of biogas contami-
nants have been discussed in detail. Solid sorbents (cid:1) especially
impregnated activated carbons (cid:1) seem to be the most effective and
proven solution for the ultra-deep purification of biogas (polishing
stage). Indeed, the SOFC requires a high-purity fuel stream and the
co-removal of different contaminants entails complex physico-
chemical phenomena and thus an optimized surface chemistry of
the adsorbent material. Further research work is encouraged in this
area to identify cost-effective solutions for durable and reliable bio-
gas clean-up from harmful contaminants. The development of
online and real-time gas analysis should also be addressed in the
near future. A reliable and continuous monitoring of the evolution
of contaminants from inlet to outlet of the clean-up vessels is key
not only to detect the early breakthrough of one of more contami-
nants, but also to enforce a higher usage rate of the selected sor-
bent media (e.g., to avoid the early change of unspent adsorbent
material).

PDegradation of the fuel cell reformer and the Ni-anode is
shown to be extremely severe in the presence of siloxanes, thus
making it critical to include an effective biogas clean-up system.
Even trace amounts (tens of ppb) of siloxanes can cause a severe
and irreversible damage on both the Ni-reformer and SOFC. The
impact of H2S is mild compared to siloxanes, and it is well under-
stood. H2S is certainly detrimental to the reformer and SOFC per-
formance, however, more in the form of a temporary (catalyst or
electro-catalyst) deactivation rather than as an irreversible degra-
dation as in the case of siloxanes. Finally, HCl is the least critical
contaminant of those investigated. The impact on the SOFC per-
formance is almost negligible.

PAmong the various available power technologies, high-tempera-
ture fuel cell generators can reach the highest electrical efficiency in
the capacity range from kW to few MWs. The typical biogas capacity
of an anaerobic digestion plant or landfill well fits this range and
electrical efficiencies up to 60%, and beyond, are already achieved by
commercial systems (Fig. 3). Modular FC technology is thus an ideal
candidate for the integration with biogas plants, in which thermal
energy is also required for the digester, which could easily be recov-
ered from the off-heat of the FC exhaust gas. From a technical point
of view, the most significant drawback and possible bottleneck for
FC generators remains the stringent requirement they have in term
of fuel purity. Nonetheless, we have shown that dealing with biogas
contaminants is already feasible with the current technology level,
and reaching sub-ppm outlet concentrations of sulfur, siloxanes and
halogens is possible.
