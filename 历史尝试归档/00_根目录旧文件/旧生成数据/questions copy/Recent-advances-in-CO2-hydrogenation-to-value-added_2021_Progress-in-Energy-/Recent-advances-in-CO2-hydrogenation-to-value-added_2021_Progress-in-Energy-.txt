Climate change, global warming, fossil fuel depletion and rising fuel prices have created great incentives 
to seek alternative fuel production technologies. CO 2 transformation to value-added products using re- 
newable H 2 has proven to be an emerging solution to enable this goal. In this regard, three different 
promising processes, namely methane, methanol and hydrocarbon synthesis via CO 2 hydrogenation are 
thoroughly discussed. In addition, the inﬂuential factors affecting process eﬃciencies such as catalyst de- 
sign and mechanistic insight, operating conditions as well as reactor types are investigated, with key 
pathways that dictate catalyst activity and selectivity of the most promising materials described. Further- 
more, a brief overview of the reactor conﬁguration and its crucial role in the improving process viabil- 
ity is analyzed. Accordingly, ﬁxed-bed, ﬂuidized-bed, annular and spherical reactors along with H 2 O/H 2 
perm-selective membrane reactors are disscussed for hydrocarbon production. In addition, different re- 
actor conﬁgurations are compared to assess the best one that is adjustable depending on the reaction 
mechanism. Consequently, a corrugated-wall dual-type membrane reactor is proposed as an emerging 
alternative for CO 2 hydrogenation to value-added products.

1. Introduction 

The combustion of fossil fuels (coal, oil and natural gas) to gen- 
erate  energy  results  in  huge  amounts  of  greenhouse  gas  (GHG) 
emissions to the atmosphere, typically in CO 
2 form [1–4] . In 2018, 
2  emissions  [5] ,  resulted  in  a 
approximately  33  gigatonnes  of  CO 
considerable increase in the atmospheric CO 
2  concentration from 
280 ppm to 410 ppm. Production of sustainable and clean energy 
as a necessity for future consumption requires energy-eﬃcient and 
advanced technologies [6–8] . In addition, increasing the use of re- 
newable energy and valorization of different raw materials are nec- 
essary. In this regard, carbon capture and storage (CCS) as well as 
carbon capture and utilization (CCU) are hypothesized to play im- 
portant roles [9–15] . These technologies offer signiﬁcant beneﬁts 
for reducing carbon emissions, with the latter promoting a circular 
economy, through encouraging industrial symbiosis from industry 
with large CO 
2 footprints, and providing renewable energy storage. 
This is consistent with the European policy with the goal of re- 
ducing 40 % of GHG emissions by 2030 compared to 1990 levels 
[ 16 , 17 ]. Indeed, CO 
2 storage and use to produce various chemicals 
play a signiﬁcant role in achieving this objective. 

CCS  plays  an  important  role  in  the  reduction  of  GHG  emis- 
sions along with climate change mitigation in the future. CCU is 
another attractive approach; but, compared to total CO 
2  produc- 
2 is rather small 
tion the market for the utilization of recovered CO 
(11%–17%) [18] . However, CCU results in the production of valuable 
fuels and chemicals in addition to the reduction of CO 
2 emissions 
compared to CCS [19] . CCUS is the integration of CCU and CCS that 
may be able to effectively exploit the beneﬁts of the correspond- 
ing approaches, via increasing both economic and environmental 

incentives [20] . In this regard, CO 
2 is a key component to decrease 
fossil  consumption  via  transforming  to  valuable  chemicals  while 
ensuring the energy eﬃciency of a process. Moreover, CO 
2 conver- 
sion to feedstocks for the chemical/petrochemical industry can be 
an eﬃcient method for the renewable energy contribution in the 
chemical chain [21–27] . 

Many  studies  have  been  devoted  to  the  utilization  of  CO 
2  as 
an available waste resource in terms of a cheap raw material [28–
32] . CO 
2  can be supplied via the integration with various chem- 
ical plants. For instance, emissions of ammonia plants can be re- 
covered  for  the  simultaneous  production  of  methanol  and  am- 
monia. The cement industry as well as iron and steel plants are 
2  sources  [33] .  In  addition,  much  attention  should  be 
other  CO 
paid to industrial and municipal wastes as potential CO 
2  sources 
[ 34 , 35 ].  Therefore,  studying  and  disseminating  knowledge  about 
2  from other pro- 
fuels and chemical production via capturing CO 
cesses is of paramount signiﬁcance. However, social acceptance is 
very low about this issue and some skepticism regarding long term 
ecological advantages exist [36] . Centi et al . [21] and Olah et al . 
[37] proposed three different pathways for CO 
2 utilization to pro- 
duce various compounds comprising methanol and dimethyl ether 
(DME). As shown in Scheme 1 , the main products of CO 
2  activa- 
tion and transformation are methane, methanol, DME and hydro- 
carbons (oleﬁns/ LPG/ gasoline/aromatic) [38] . Using excess renew- 
able energy from wind and solar, the “Power-to-Fuel” strategy has

as solvent, energy source (e.g., as fuel, or in mixture with gaso- 
line) and chemical feedstocks (e.g., for the production of methyl 
methacrylate,  dimethyl  carbonate,  chloromethane,  acetic  acid, 
formaldehyde, methylamines, dimethyl terephthalate, and methyl 
tertiary  butyl  ether,  etc.)  [50–52] .  In  addition,  methanol  can  be 
used for the production of ethylene and propylene via methanol- 
to-oleﬁn (MTO) processes [ 53 , 54 ]. In recent years, methanol pro- 
2 has gained much attention owing to the propo- 
duction from CO 
sition  of  the  so-called  “Power-to-Fuel” concept  [ 4 8 , 4 9 ],  which  is 
driven  by  availability  of  cost  effective  renewable  energy.  Direct 
methanol production through CO 
2 hydrogenation is represented in 
(R2) [55] : 
C O 2 + 3 H 2 ↔ C H 3 OH + H 2 O  (cid:2)H 298 K = −49 . 5 kJ/mol 

(R2) 

However, the traditional route for methanol production is the 
gas  to  methanol  process,  where  CO  is  obtained  from  CO 
2  via 
the  reverse  water  gas  shift  (RWGS)  reaction  and  transformed  to 
methanol as presented in (R3) and (R4) [ 56 , 57 ]: 
C O 2 + H 2 ↔ CO + H 2 O  (cid:2)H 298 K = +41 . 2 kJ/mol 

(R3) 

CO + 2 H 2 ↔ C H 3 OH  (cid:2)H 298 K = −90 . 7 kJ/mol 

(R4) 

Many effort s to synthesize effective catalysts along with design- 
ing advanced reactors for CO 
2 hydrogenation have made it a com- 
petitive technology with industrial methanol synthesis from syn- 
2 ratio for methanol production should be

2 , i.e., for a direct methanol fuel cell, is more ap- 
methanol from CO 
propriate compared to reversible H 
2 storage as formic acid for use 
in PEM fuel cells. In addition, methanol-based fuel cells were found 
to comprise the greatest portion of the methanol market [ 21 , 59 ].

Methanol can also be converted to DME, a colorless environ- 
mentally friendly ether, which is not corrosive or toxic, and can be 
employed as a clean fuel and chemical building block for the pro- 
duction of valuable materials such as light oleﬁns (ethylene and 
propylene) [60] . In addition, chloroﬂuorocarbon species in aerosols 
can  be  replaced  by  DME  [61] .  Moreover,  DME  can  be  used  to 
produce  alkyl  aromatics  as  a  hydrogen  source  in  fuel  cells.  Be- 
sides, DME acts as an important intermediate for methyl acetate 
and  dimethyl  sulfate  production  [62] .  DME  can  be  produced  via 
catalytic  methanol  dehydration  ( R5 )  based  on  either  Langmuir- 
Hinshelwood [63] or Eley-Rideal [64] mechanisms, wherein both 
DME and water are reported to act as inhibitors during reaction 
[65] .

Ethanol production from carbon dioxide has received less atten- 
tion [ 66 , 67 ], despite the interest in recent decades in employing 
ethanol as both fuel [68] and feedstock for the production of nu- 
merous chemicals [69] . Ethanol can also increase the octane num- 
ber of petrol and decrease CO and particulate matter emissions. Di- 
rect ethanol synthesis proceeds according to (R6) [ 4 8 , 4 9 ] and has 
low selectivity toward C 
2 +  alcohols and low conversions even at 
high pressures.

The reaction is believed to proceed through two steps compris- 

ing RWGS ( R3 ) and CO hydrogenation ( R7 ) [66] :

CO 

2 conversion to CO occurs at high temperatures (a CO 
2 con- 
version of about 48% can be obtained at 575 °C) owing to the en- 
dothermicity of the RWGS reaction. Another pathway for ethanol 
production is through DME transformation as reported by Atsonios 
et al . [ 4 8 , 4 9 ]. At ﬁrst, carbon dioxide and hydrogen react to form

ture and promising technology in this regard [46] . Different cata- 
lysts catalyze CO

results in CH

The Sabatier reaction is well known, but its application as an ap- 
2 utilization is hindered due to the large H 
propriate route for CO

consumption, lower energy per unit volume and diﬃculties in stor- 
age compared with oxygenates (methanol, DME).

methanol according to ( R2–R4) and then methanol is dehydrated 
to DME via ( R5) . DME is then transformed into methyl acetate as 
an intermediate in ( R8) , which is then hydrogenated to ethanol as 
represented in ( R9) :

CO 

2  can  be  hydrogenated  to  hydrocarbons  through  both  di- 
rect and indirect pathways, e.g. by producing synthesis gas and/or 
methanol as an intermediate. [70–73] . The indirect path can be ac- 
complished in a single-stage reactor using hybrid catalysts or in 
multi-stage reactors to conduct multi-step transformations simul- 
taneously ( R3) along with ( R10 to R11 ) [74] .

2  consumption  and  comprise  more  reaction  steps 
with respect to the production of oxygenates and is not considered 
as a favorable method of fuel production [75] . Nevertheless, other 
reasons such as better infrastructure integration and growth in the 
market  may  justify  this  path.  Thus,  an  integrated  life-cycle  and 
techno-economic analysis are essential to analyze different possi- 
bilities.  In  fact,  direct  hydrocarbon  production  using  CO 
2  hydro- 
genation, which includes RWGS and FT reactions is one of the most 
signiﬁcant applications of CCU ( Scheme 1 ) [38] . 

1.2. Hydrogen sources 

In  this  context,  hydrogen  is  required  for  the  activation  and

the ability to activate CO 
2 , owing to exhibiting high energy den- 
sity, which is a thermodynamically stable molecule [ 76 , 77 ]. Steam 
methane  reforming,  syngas,  coke  oven  gas  and  chlorine  alkali 
plants can be used as hydrogen sources in hydrogenation reactions 
[78] . Various hydrogen sources are presented in Scheme 3 . How- 
ever,  future  investigations  should  be  devoted  to  ﬁnding  alterna- 
tive sources of H 
2 to guarantee process economics (approximately 
65% of costs are ascribed to the electrolyzer) [79–82] . In addition, 
hydrogen production technologies should have a zero carbon foot- 
print to meet GHG mitigation targets. 

Today,  the  most  common  method  of  H 

2  production  is  steam 
methane reforming, which results in CO formation along with hy- 
2 O can lead to hydro- 
drogen ( R13 ). Further reaction of CO with H 
gen generation according to ( R14) .

H 2 O + CO → H 2 + C O 2  (cid:2)H 298 K = −41 . 2 kJ/mol 

(R14) 

These emissions can be minimized via autothermal reforming 
where oxygen is used along with H 
2 O ( R15 ) in the reactor at high 
temperatures ( > 727 °C). However, further optimization concerning 
2 /CO ratio, catalyst activity and its deactivation are required 
the H 
to achieve eco-friendly process standards.

Another  route  for  hydrogen  generation  is  the  utilization  of 
biomass in gasiﬁcation, pyrolysis and liquefaction processes [84–
86] . Biomass gasiﬁcation is more beneﬁcial with respect to con- 
ventional  coal  gasiﬁcation  since  biomass  is  naturally  renewable. 
Combining biomass and coal gasiﬁcation can minimize CO 
2  pro- 
duction and subsequently reduces negative environmental conse- 
quences [87] . Ethanol, glycerol, bio-liquids and bio-oils can be used 
as biomass sources. However, problems regarding feed quality, sea- 
sonal availability and regional dependencies should be solved as 
well as economic issues. Consequently, improved technologies with 
reduced catalyst deactivation as well as fewer carbon emissions re- 
quire development.

One of the promising H 

2 generation methods, to produce high 
purity hydrogen without further separation costs, is water electrol- 
ysis ( R16 ). Industrial electrolysis plants can produce hydrogen with 
about 50-70 % eﬃciency. However, the main issue of this process 
is to achieve electricity production with low cost and low carbon 
emission. Therefore, fossil fuels should be substituted by renew- 
able energies such as solar or wind in electricity generation plants 
2 formation [88–90] . The mentioned energies are 
to mitigate the CO 
climate dependent, which should be considered in designing sus- 
tainable operation.

metal loading. [112–119] . Ru and Rh are the most active catalysts 
in CO 
2 methanation, exhibiting higher turnover numbers (about 20 
times) than other noble metals when supported on alumina. As a 
dopant,  Ru  could  facilitate  the  reduction  of  CeO 
2  at  lower  tem- 
peratures rather than undoped Ce-oxide and provided about 50% 
CO 
2  conversion.  In  addition,  Ru  and  Rh-based  oxides  have  been 
reported for their high methane selectivity (about 99%) compared 
to that of Pt or Pd, which were more selective towards CO [120] . 
Moreover, noble metals have been found to be more resistant to 
deactivation over a wide temperature range, due to less carbon de- 
posits. However, limited availability and high cost of noble metals 
have hampered their application for CO 

2 methanation [ 99 , 120 ]. 

2 O splitting to H 

Solar energy can also be used for H 

2  and O 
2 
in the presence of catalysts exhibiting special electronic structures 
(photo-semiconductor)  or  some  microorganisms  [91] .  However, 
this process is still far from commercial implementation due to low 
eﬃciency, low durability and high oxidation-resistant catalysts. As 
2 byproduct, water electrolysis seems to be 
a whole, due to no CO 
the most appropriate source of H 
2 -free sources 
can be used for the required electricity generation [92] .

1.3. Scope of current review 

Accordingly, kinetic modeling of CO 

A recent review by Jiang et al . [93] addresses CO 

2  hydrogena- 
tion to methanol in terms of catalyst design, mechanistic and ki- 
netic studies as well as reactor design and optimization. In addi- 
tion, Zhong et al . [94] studied the thermodynamic challenges and 
catalyst development of this process along with industrial reactor 
development, while Nie et al . [95] focused on recent advances in 
catalytic materials and mechanistic insight for the production of 
alcohols and hydrocarbons. However, the signiﬁcance of choosing 
the appropriate reactor conﬁguration along with mechanistic con- 
siderations have not been addressed for the mentioned processes. 
2  hydrogenation to hydro- 
carbons was investigated [96] and the kinetic parameters of the 
simultaneous RWGS and FT reactions were evaluated through an 
artiﬁcial  bee  colony  (ABC)  algorithm  considering  mass  and  heat 
transport  in  a  ﬁxed-bed  catalytic  reactor  [97] .  This  study  sys- 
tematically investigates three different processes, namely methane, 
methanol and hydrocarbon synthesis via hydrogenation of CO 
2 . The 
effects of catalyst and mechanism, operating conditions as well as 
reactor type on CO 
2  hydrogenation are investigated. Additionally, 
a comprehensive outline about reactor conﬁgurations as the most 
signiﬁcant parameter on process enhancement is provided. More- 
over, by taking account of the current literature, the differenct con- 
ﬁgurations of the reactor based on the reaction mechanisms are 
discussed.  Lastly,  a  corrugated-wall  dual-type  membrane  reactor 
is proposed as a promising alternative for CO 
2  hydrogenation to 
value-added products. 

2. Methanation 

CO 

2 hydrogenation to methane (Sabatier reaction) is an exother- 
mic reaction, which has been developed in 1902 [98–100] . This re- 
action is signiﬁcant for closed loop CO 
2  from 
contained spaces are recycled to fuel for combustion. Literature re- 
ported effects of catalyst development and mechanistic studies, op- 
erating conditions and reactor conﬁguration are presented in the 
following sections.

2.1. Development of catalysts and mechanism in methanation 

Many attempts have been devoted to ﬁnding eﬃcient catalysts 
for the CO 
2 methanation [101–111] . Noble metals such as Rh, Ru, 
Pd and Pt supported on various oxides have been reported as very 
active  methanation  catalysts  even  at  low  temperatures  and  low 

5 

Among  non-noble  metals,  Co,  Fe  and  Ni  have  been  proposed 
2  methanation [121] , since they showed good performance 
for CO 
in the FT reaction. However, using CO 
2 instead of CO led to higher 
hydrogenation performance, which was attributed to the weaker 
CO 
2 -Co adsorption compared to that of CO-Co resulting in the for- 
4  rather than long-chain hydrocarbons [122] . More- 
mation of CH 
over, Co was reported to be more expensive than Ni, which has 
hindered  its  utilization  for  industrial  scale  methane  production 
[104] . Generally, pure Fe has not shown comparable CO 
2  metha- 
nation performance, but in combination with other metals such as 
Co and Ni could enhance the process yield by enhancing CH 
4 se- 
lectivity. The formation of Fe-Co alloys in Fe-Co/alumina increased 
methane selectivity via reducing the formation of aluminate com- 
pared to Co/alumina [123] . Ni-based catalysts on various supports 
2 methanation as a 
have also been extensively investigated for CO 
result  of  their  great  performance  and  low  cost  [124–133] .  Ni  is 
known as the most selective catalyst among methanation catalysts, 
and exhibits a relatively high activity compared to other metals, re- 
sulting in its utilization for industrial applications [104] . However, 
the performance of the metal is strongly dependent on the metal- 
support  interface  interaction  and  properties  [ 120 , 134–136 ].  CeO 
2 
is the best support for Ni compared to Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia 
(YSZ), TiO 
3 and MgO exhibiting 100% selectivity to methane. 
Ceria proved to be able to supply large amounts of oxygen due to 
its facile oxygen exchange characteristics, and increased the CO 
2 
hydrogenation activity [137–140] . In addition, ZrO 
2 supports 
2 conversion of 95% [ 141 , 142 ]. 
showed 99% selectivity to CH 
Generally, methanation mechanisms have been categorized into 
two  groups:  associative  and  dissociative  schemes  as  depicted  in 
Fig.  1  [99] .  In  the  ﬁrst  pathway,  associative  adsorption  of  CO 
2 
and its reaction with adsorbed hydrogen led to the formation of 
oxygenates, which can be hydrogenated in several steps to form 
methane. However, in the dissociative route carbonyl and atomic 
2  adsorption  and  further  carbonyl  hydro- 
oxygen  formed  via  CO 
genation  led  to  methane  formation  [ 98 , 99 , 120 ].  Formate  species 
and  CO  are  the  main  intermediates  for  the  associative  and  dis- 
sociative pathways, respectively [120] . It has been indicated that 
synchrotron-based methods  are  the  best  facilities  to  analyze  the 
catalyst  behavior  while  studying  the  local  coordination  of  active 
species  under  practical  conditions  [ 143 , 144 ].  Identifying  the  ad- 
sorbed  species,  probing  chemical  information  from  the  ligands 
along with calculating bond distances are possible via employing 
element speciﬁc X-ray photon-in/photon-out techniques like high- 
energy resolution ﬂuorescence detected X-ray absorption near edge 
spectroscopy  (HERFD-XANES)  and  X-ray  emission  spectroscopy 
(XES) [145] .

Vogt et al . [146] proposed three paths for the Sabatier reaction 
over Ni-nano catalysts such as carbide, formate and carboxyl. They 
concluded the carbide route is the most active route over Ni/SiO 
2 
catalysts,  while  the  formate  path,  which  has  been  demonstrated 
via operando spectroscopic techniques (especially FTIR) is not ac- 
tive for Ni/SiO

been  considered  in  the  literature.  None  of  the  intermediates  or

catalysts. Interaction between main routes (carbide and formate) 
through H-assisted CO dissociation is sensible for methane forma- 
tion via CO 
2 hydrogenation, since direct CO dissociation has rather 
high energy barrier. It is noteworthy to mention that reducibility 
of catalyst supports can play a signiﬁcant role in electron delocal- 
ization around the adsorbed CO 
2 or CO. In fact, the mentioned step 
can be eﬃciently enhanced, which results in higher activity.

mono- and bi-dentate carbonates, which then were hydrogenated 
to formate. These formate species then transform into formalde-

Vrijburg et al . [152] indicated that Ni/TiO

lyst performance. In addition, oxophilic sites of MnO could increase 
CO 
2  activation.  Moreover,  DFT  (density  functional  theory)  calcu- 
lations demonstrated that COH and HCO were the intermediates 
4 /Ni (111), respectively ( Fig. 5 ). Addition- 
over Ni (311) and Mn

the latter sites.

Recently, 2D siloxene nanosheets (SiXNS) were proposed as ef- 
fective supports for Ni by Yan et al . [153] due to their high cat- 
2  methanation.  Different  selectivity  to- 
alytic  performance  in  CO 
wards  CH 
2 O  (54.3%)  and  Ni@SiXNS-EtOH  (90%) 
was  ascribed  to  different  reaction  mechanisms.  It  was  demon- 
2 dissociates to CO and O, while 
strated that over Ni@SiXNS-H 
2 O CO 
further CO dissociation and hydrogenation could result in CH 
4 for- 
mation. However, on Ni@SiXNS-EtOH the Ni active sites could form 
CH 

4 through a formate path as illustrated in Fig. 6 . 
Metal-organic  framework  (MOF)  derived  catalysts,  20Ni@UiO- 
66, could effectively catalyze the CO 
2 methanation reaction at rel- 
atively  low  temperatures  (about  300  °C)  with  57.6  %  conversion 
2  and 100% selectivity towards methane [154] . This was at- 
of CO 

tributed to the encapsulation of Ni NPs (nanoparticles) in the UiO- 
66 and uniform dispersion of these NPs in the MOF. Moreover, cat- 
alyst durability was outstanding during 100 h test. 
Cobalt (Co) is also an active element in CO 

2 methanation [155–
157] , and has been reported to enhance the dispersion of Ni while 
increasing the catalyst resistance to sintering [158] . Konsolakis et 
al . [159] compared Co and Cu-based catalysts in CO 
2 hydrogenation 
and observed that Co could drastically enhance selectivity toward 
4 while Cu favored the RWGS reaction, which led to CO produc- 
CH 
2 methanation over 
tion. Moreover, Xu et al. [160] demonstrated CO 
Ni-Co/Al 
2 dissociation, 
while Ni was active in H 

3 ( Fig. 7 ) and showed that Co induced CO 

2 chemisorption and dissociation.

Among the noble metals Rh and Ru have been considered as the 
2 methanation [120] and bimetal- 
most effective active sites for CO 
lic versions with more abundant non-precious metal components 
attract  signiﬁcant  attention.  Martin  et  al .  [136]  investigated  the 
2 hydrogenation over ceria-supported Ni and Rh catalysts at at- 
CO 
2  on the Ce 3 +  sites could react 
mospheric pressure. Activated CO 
with the dissociated hydrogen over Ni and Rh, which led to for- 
mate formation. Large Ni (6 nm) and small Rh (4 nm) nanoparti- 
2 as a support, which in turn led to weaker 
cles were found on CeO 
Ni-support interaction. Accordingly, Rh/CeO 
2 showed higher activ- 
ity towards CH 

4 formation as depicted in Fig. 8 . 

Heyl  et  al .  [161]  found  that  the  addition  of  K  to  alumina- 
supported Rh and RhNi catalysts, led to the formation of an active 
intermediate that led to CO formation. In fact, K modiﬁed the Rh 
sites and facilitated CO desorption, while increasing the H 
2 disso- 
ciation ability of the catalyst as depicted in Fig. 9 .

The addition of B was found to change the reaction pathway,

CO hydrogenation leads to the formation of HCO, which can be fur-

produced through the hydrogenation of CH, which is provided via 
the HCOH dissociation as depicted in Fig. 10 [163] . Oxygen species 
at the Ru-O-Al interface could effectively activate CO

quent methanation [164] .

that dissociation of reacting molecules resulted in the formation 
of CO, H and O on the metal active sites, which transfer to the 
surface of the MSN. Bridged and linear carbonyls were formed via 
interaction of CO with surface oxides of the support, while biden- 
tate formate species were formed due to atomic hydrogen ( Fig. 15 ). 
Moreover, bidentate species were reported as the most important 
sources of CH

4 and ZnFe 

Chiang et al. [175] showed that MnFe 

4 are ac- 
2 O 
2  activation, due to the high reactivity of fer- 
tive catalysts in CO 
rite towards CO 
2  decomposition. In fact, metals such as Mn and 
Zn were reported to increase the oxygen-deﬁciency of ferrite, and 
in turn enhance the decomposition potential of divalent Fe sites. 
Oxygen-deﬁcient catalysts could produce both C and CO as illus- 
trated  in  Fig.  16 .  In  the  ﬁrst  path,  methanation  occurred  via  H 
2 
treatment of the carbon deposited on the surface. In turn in the 
second path, with the metal-ferrite catalysts being less active, CH 
4 
was produced via further reaction of H 

2 with CO [175] .

Products  were  predominantly  CH 

2 O  at  rather 
low temperatures in the range of 200–250 °C. Increasing reaction 
temperature more than 450 °C increased the formation of CO by- 
product,  according  to  the  RWGS  reaction  (R3) ,  while  decreasing 
4 yield [176–180] . Considering that 
CO 
2 conversion and overall CH 
methane  production  from  CO 
2  hydrogenation  is  highly  exother- 
mic,  increased  temperature  was  not  beneﬁcial  for  this  reaction.

However, as temperature surpassed 550 °C, CO 
proached the highest value and then reduced since the RWGS re- 
action prevailed. Carbon deposition was also negligible under this 
condition. From a thermodynamic perspective, methane production 
from CO 
2  hydrogenation was supposed to occur through the fol- 
lowing reactions ( R17 ) as proposed by Park et al. [181] . 

(R17) 

Therefore, at high temperature, CO 

2 methanation includes a se- 
ries of successive reactions, which begins with the RWGS, followed 
by the CO hydrogenation in the presence of steam when the ratio 
2 O  is  3/1/1.  The  addition  of  steam  to  the  CO  metha- 
of  H 
nation  reaction  can  inhibit  carbon  deposition.  In  the  same  way,

in catalyst methanation performance in terms of both CO

the best methanation performance with respect to the other cata- 
lysts due to high basicity, which favored CO

and atomic hydrogen formation as can be observed in Fig. 14 .

2 methanation is favorable 
compared to the mentioned reaction, CO 
as well from a thermodynamic point of view. To achieve a desir- 
able CH 
4 yield at atmospheric pressure, the reaction temperature 
should not surpass 300 °C. However, the eight-electron transfer of 
CO 
2 hydrogenation reaction to methane is challenging due to con- 
siderable kinetic barriers [182] , which necessitate the development 
of a highly active catalyst capable of operation at such low tem- 
peratures. 

Gao et al . [183] studied the inﬂuence of temperature and pres- 
2  conversion during methanation (R1) .  Similar to 
sure on the CO 
the trend observed for CO methanation, the conversion of CO 
2 de- 
creased as temperature was increased, but increased with pressure 
for temperatures lower than 600 °C. This effect was attributed to 
2 methanation along with a volume re- 
the exothermic nature of CO 

2 methanation proceeded above 
duction during reaction (R1) . As CO 
600 °C at 1 atm, CO 
2 conversion increased steadily in contrast to 
what was observed in CO methanation. This was particularly due 
to the dominating RWGS reaction ( R3 ) at temperatures higher than 
600  °C.  Gao  et  al .  [183]  also  investigated  the  inﬂuence  on  CH 
4 
selectivity, and observed that the direction of changes with tem- 
perature and pressure was identical to those observed in the CO 
methanation. These results at atmospheric pressure were in agree- 
ment with simulation results of Beuls et al . [117] and Ocampo et 
al . [184] for CO 
2 methanation, and also in accordance with the re- 
sults observed by Du and co-workers over Ni/MCM-41 [185] . Gao 
et al. [183] concluded that CO 
2  methanation was harder than CO 
methanation under the same reaction conditions. However, below 
2  metha- 
500  °C,  higher  CH 

4  selectivity  was  achieved  during  CO

nation compared to that observed for CO methanation. Gao et al. 
[183] demonstrated the inﬂuence of pressure and temperature on 
CH 
4 yield. High pressure and low temperature promoted the CO 
2 
methanation, in accordance to the predicted values from calcula- 
tions for CO methanation. Moreover, carbon generation was found 
2 O formation 
to be negligible under simulation conditions, due to H 
that inhibited carbon deposition during CO 

2 methanation. 

CO 

2 conversion and CH 

4 selectivity follow a similar trend in the 
presence  of  almost  all  of  the  catalysts  as  represented  in  Fig.  17 
[186] . While elevated pressure increased both CO 
2 conversion and 
4  selectivity, raising temperature only has a positive effect on 
CH 
CO 
4 selectivity passing through a maximum 
2 conversion, with CH 
and decreasing for higher temperatures [187–189] . This can be ac- 
counted  for  considering  the  exothermic  and  reversible  nature  of 
4  se- 
2  methanation reaction, which can result in high CH 
the CO 
lectivity at moderate temperatures. In fact, for Co, Ru and Rh cat-

4 was found to be affected more 
alysts, the selectivity towards CH 
by temperature as a result of their hydrogenation capabilities [190] . 
Moreover, high temperature led to catalyst deactivation, which can 
affect the thermodynamic equilibrium. Besides, as temperature in- 
creases, side reactions as well as the endothermic RWGS reaction 
proceeds more and CH 

4 selectivity decreases [ 191 , 192 ]. 

Moreover, the effect of water addition to feed gas was explored

ing concept [193–195] . Accordingly, the catalyst support or some 
additive sorbents can adsorb the produced H 
2 O during methana- 
tion,  which  can  reduce  the  negative  effects  of  water.  Regenera- 
tion  of  the  saturated  catalyst  can  be  accomplished  via  applying 
pressure  and/or  temperature  swing  processes  [104] .  Accordingly, 
zeolite-based  materials  have  been  proposed  as  promising  candi- 
dates for water uptake. High Si/Al ratios have been speculated to 
have a negative effect on the water inhibition role of zeolitic mate- 
rials. Utilization of zeolites Y, 13X and 5A has been reported to en- 
hance water sorption during CO 
2 methanation resulting in compa- 
rable performance [167] . However, Aziz et al . [169] showed that the 
presence of water vapor reduced carbonyl species over Ni/MSN cat- 
alysts. In addition, Si-O-Si hydrolysis in the presence of adsorbed 
water by the MSN support collapsed the support structure. As re- 
ported by Bartholomew et al. , [196] water can increase the sinter- 
ing rate and collapse the support. 

2.3. Effect of reactor conﬁguration 

Owing to catalyst deactivation and thermodynamic limitations 
at high temperatures, various reactor conﬁgurations have been in- 
vestigated  to  remove  the  released  heat  of  the  Sabatier  reaction, 
which is a challenging issue even at steady-state conditions [197–
199] . Since the Sabatier reaction is exothermic ( R1 ), the considera- 
tion of appropriate cooling equipment in single and stage-wise re- 
actors is of signiﬁcant importance to prevent hot spots [ 98 , 200 ]. 
According  to  recent  research,  various  catalytic  conﬁgurations  for 
2  methanation have been established, which are illustrated in 
CO 

14 

Fig.  18 .  Fixed-bed  reactors  have  been  used  widely  in  the  CO 
2 
methanation process [201–208] , but only wall-cooled ﬁxed-bed re- 
actors have been commercialized. 

Recently, Pérez et al. [209] reported the application of a newly 
developed  multichannel  minireactor  designed  by  Technical  Re- 
search and Innovation (R&I) for the Sabatier reaction at temper- 
atures ranging from 200 to 400 °C and 15 bar over Ni-based cat- 
alysts ( Fig. 19 ). The multichannel minireactor showed a superior 
performance compared to a ﬁxed-bed reactor. A maximum CH 
4 se- 
lectivity higher than 99% at 96.1% CO 
2 conversion was obtained at 
350 °C. The small channel diameter results in better gas/particle 
contact while enhancing heat transfer, which could avoid the hot 
spot formation. This reactor was able to handle about 820 Nm 3 /h 
CO 

2 per square meter of channel at the best performance. 
According to simulation studies, the occurrence of hot spots is 
inevitable in such reactors, even while using undiluted and stoi- 
chiometric H 
2  mixtures as feed gas, and even at small reac- 
tor diameters [ 210 , 211 ]. However, the occurrence of considerable 
hot spots should be prohibited, due to safety issues of the process. 
Therefore, various reactor conﬁgurations along with feed and cat- 
alyst dilution have been proposed for reactor temperature control 
[ 212 , 213 ]. Moreover, exploitation of heat exchangers and multiple 
reactors in series [214] or even advanced control methods, which 
employ  unstable  operation  points  of  the  reactor  have  been  pro- 
posed [215] . Although these ideas can be useful for steady-state 
operation, some of them show undesirable results under transient 
conditions, as reported by Quina and Ferreira [216] for catalyst di- 
lution.

Optimizing  the  interactions  of  reaction  rate,  heat  and  mass 
transport  at  a  particle  scale,  Schlereth  and  Hinrichsen  [210]  as- 
sessed the probability of reactor temperature control. However, the 
application of this method was not investigated. As a result of nu- 
merous degrees of freedom, this is not a trivial accomplishment 
for many systems with deﬁnite constraints, as reported in the lit- 
erature. For instance, particles with radial distribution of the ac- 
tive material in the porous matrix have been considered frequently. 
Amongst these, ‘egg-shell’ particles were regularly preferred, since 
they had active layers close to the catalyst surface, which reduce 
the heat and mass transport resistances [ 217 , 218 ]. In addition, us- 

ing such particles led to lower consumption of expensive material 
in the reactor without reducing the performance. Wu et al . [ 219 , 
220 ] have experimentally shown for the CO methanation, that the 
carbon selectivity and deposition can be signiﬁcantly affected via 
the spatial distribution of the active material in the catalyst parti- 
cles. 

Furthmore,  conﬁgured  ﬁxed-beds  with  stacking  several  beds 
containing  different  catalysts  allow  operation  at  a  temperature 
lower  by  approximately  100  °C  [205] .  Moreover,  Miguel  et  al .

where CO

bent and subsequently hydrogenated in the reaction section over 
Ni-based  catalyst.  The  process  was  performed  in  two  columns 
switching from CO 
2 adsorption to methanation reaction. Giglio et 
al . [222] proposed a methanation process coupling with a steam 
electrolysis  system  for  removing  the  reaction  heat  of  the  multi- 
tube  ﬁxed  beds.  Accordingly,  a  high-temperature  steam,  which 
was  produced  via  removing  the  reactor  heat,  could  supply  the 
required  H 
2  via  a  solid  oxide  elec- 
trolyzer. Prairie et al . [223] demonstrated the advantage of using a 
continuous recycle, ﬁxed-bed/ DRIFTS (diffuse reﬂectance infrared 
Fourier transform spectroscopy) cell reactor for CO 
2  methanation 
over Ru/TiO 
2 . Sun et al . [224] studied a ﬂuidized-bed reactor theo- 
retically and showed that the appropriate recycle ratio could result 
in higher yields of CH 
4 while prohibiting hot spots. However, the 
modeling investigation of the ﬁxed-bed reactors by Ducamp et al . 
[225] showed that reaction heat could not be removed from the 
ﬁxed-beds effectively. They proposed using modular plate reactor- 
heat exchangers with millimeter-scale catalysts distributed in their 
layers, for enhanced heat transfer. 

In  addition,  compared  to  metallic  foam  reactors  and  milli- 
structured ﬁxed beds, annular ﬁxed-bed reactors had higher CO 
2 
conversion (about 95%) at a dilution factor of 3 using the same cat- 
alysts. However, dilution led to additional separation costs. In ad- 
dition, milli-structured reactors showed high productivity as well 
as high space-time yields [98] . Coupling two ﬁxed-bed reactors for 
sorption and reaction of CO 
2 was proposed by Miguel et al . [221] . 
The sorption part comprised a hydrotalcite packing promoted by K, 
while the reaction section included Ni-based catalysts at low pres- 
sures (approximately 2.5 bar). Although the materials were com- 
mercially available and a high CO 
2  conversion was achieved, the 
CH 
4  purity reached only 37% at 350 °C, which therefore asks for 
further design improvements. The same process was proposed by 
Veselovskaya et al . [226] where K 
3  and NKM-2V (com- 
mercial nickel catalyst) were used in the ﬁrst and second ﬁxed- 
beds, respectively. In addition, Gruber et al . [227] suggested a two- 
stage  reactor  with  different  catalyst  thicknesses  to  decrease  the 
amount of required catalyst and reactor length. However, optimiza- 
tion of the operating conditions and heat transfer required further 
investigations to ensure the economy of the system.

Götz  et  al .  [228]  used  a  three-phase  methanation  reactor  for 
studying heat transfer and hydrodynamic stability. The Key Labo- 
ratory of Coal Science and Technology of Taiyuan (China) concen- 
trated on the development of optimized catalysts for three-phase 
methanation processes [ 229 , 230 ]. In three-phase reactors, the liq- 

16 

uid phase is characterized by a high heat capacity which allows for 
accurate and effective reactor temperature control. The reactor can 
be operated under isothermal process conditions even at high load 
variations [231] . Weaknesses of this conﬁguration of reactor are re- 
lated to the additional gas–liquid mass transfer resistance as well 
as to the decomposition and evaporation of the heat transfer ﬂuid 
[232] . 

Besides  thermal  catalytic  reactors,  dielectric  barrier  discharge 
(DBD) plasma reactors have recently attracted attention owing to 
the improvements of catalyst performance at lower temperatures 
[233–239] . Hybrid plasma-catalytic reactors [ 240 , 241 ] exhibit more 
than 75% CO 
2 conversion along with 90% selectivity at 90 °C, while 
in the absence of plasma negligible conversion was reported at the 
same temperature. In addition, Azzolina-Jury et al . [242] compared 
both in-plasma catalysis (IPC) and post-plasma catalysis (PPC) for 
2  methanation over Ni/ZSM-11 and Ni/USY cata- 
low pressure CO 
lysts ( Fig. 20 ). It was observed that CH 
4 production was only pos- 
sible in IPC mode at low temperature ( ∼125 °C); signiﬁcantly lower 
than conventional reactors which require ∼ 400 °C. In addition CO 
2 
conversion in IPC mode was increased to 60-70% from 0-30% in the 
conventional reactor. However, more comprehensive insight with 
respect to the operating conditions as well as power, voltage, dis- 
charge length and conﬁguration is required for commercial imple- 
mentation. 

The  summary  of  previous  experimental  research  for  methane 

production from CO 

2 is presented in Table 1 . 

3. Methanol synthesis 

Methanol is an alternative fuel, a common solvent, and a start- 
ing material in the chemical industry. Indeed, CO can be replaced 
with CO 
2 in methanol pro- 
duction [243–250] as represented in (R2) . 

2 as a potent route for utilization of CO 

From a thermodynamic aspect, temperature reduction or pres- 
sure elevation could favor methanol synthesis. There is evidence 
that  improved  reaction  temperature  (higher  than  240  °C)  facili- 
tates CO 
2  activation and synthesis of methanol [251–254] . How- 
2 hydrogenation, 
ever, many by-products are formed during the CO 
like carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons (HCs), formic acid and ethanol 
[255–259] ,  which  necessitates  the  selection  of  a  highly  selective 
catalyst toward methanol. Usually, catalysts employed in the CO 
2 
hydrogenation are the same as used in the CO hydrogenation for 
methanol synthesis. Researchers have shown that the catalyst type,

operating conditions, and reactor conﬁguration play a critical role 
in the hydrogenation of CO 

2 to methanol as discussed below. 

3.1. Development of catalysts and mechanism in methanol synthesis 

Many  types  of  metal-based  catalysts  have  been  studied  for 
methanol synthesis, and copper (Cu) has turned out as a majorly 
active catalytic element, using different promoters such as B, Si, Zn, 
Ag, Cr, Ti, Ce, Zr, Al, V, Ga, etc. [260–268] . Although Cu-based cat- 
alysts have been studied extensively, their deactivation, sintering 
and phase segregation in CO 
2  hydrogenation processes have cre- 
ated great incentives to explore for novel materials. In this regard, 
3 )  has  been  identiﬁed  as  an  emerging  mate- 
Indium  oxide  (In 
rial in methanol synthesis via CO 
2  hydrogenation due to its high 
selectivity  and  stability  [269-272] .  Based  on  DFT  calculations,  it 
was suggested that oxygen defective sites played an important role 
2 activation and hydrogenation [273–275] . Moreover, suitable

supports can affect the stabilization and formation of catalytic ac- 
tive phases as well as adjusting the interactions between the pro- 
moter  and  the  major  component  of  catalyst  [276–283] .  In  addi- 
tion, the acid/base properties of the catalyst are also determined 
by the support type [ 284 , 285 ]. The main catalytic materials used 
for methanol production are depicted in Scheme 4 . Accordingly, Cu 
has been the most widespread metal followed by Pd and bimetal- 
3  has been the most widely used cata- 
lic catalysts. Cu-ZnO-Al 
lyst for CO 
3  and 
2 have been other materials used in combination with Cu-ZnO, 
TiO 
2 have been the most common supports. How- 
while Al 
2  and zeolites have been the most appro- 
ever, Ga 
priate supports for Pd-based catalysts. Among bimetallic catalysts, 
Ni-Ga has been the most popular followed by Co-Cu, Pd-Cu and 
Au-Cu  (or  Ag)  [286] .  The  In-based  catalysts  have  demonstrated 
comparable  performance  in  bifunctional  catalysts  such  as  Pd-In 
[287–289] , Zr-In [ 290 , 291 ] and composite In-based oxides/zeolite 
[292–295] .

Zhao  et  al .  [296]  proposed  three  pathways  for  methanol  for- 
mation  over  Cu-based  catalysts  as  illustrated  in  Scheme  5 .  In 
2  adsorption  occurs  via  formate  (HCOO)  for- 
the  ﬁrst  route,  CO

(H 
2  hydro- 
genation  and  C –O  bond  scissions,  which  starts  with  hydrocar- 
boxyl (COOH) formation, followed by isomerization of dihydroxyl- 
carbenes (-C(OH) 
2 ). COH species then form via OH scission of dihy- 
droxylcarbenes and transforms to HCOH species after the addition 
of H-atoms. Further hydrogenation of this intermediate, results in 
methanol  production.  The  third  route  begins  similar  to  the  sec- 
ond path and proceeds via CO formation (RWGS). Further hydro- 
genation results in the formation of HCO, adsorbed methoxy and 
eventually methanol. Comparing the suggested pathways, the hy- 
drocarboxyl  route  (second  route)  was  the  most  favorable  among 
others due to lower energy barriers [ 296 , 297 ]. Various metal ox- 
ides have been used as additives (support, promoter or active site)

2  hydrogenation  mechanism  over  Cu/ZnO/Al 
tel  et  al .  [305]  showed  that  the  synergy  between  ZnO  and  Cu 
due  to  well-distributed  ZnO  on  Cu  surface,  results  in  methanol 
production  through  a  formate  path.  In  addition,  Larmier  et  al . 
[306] also demonstrated that formate was an important interme- 
diate in methanol production over Cu/ZrO

Chen et al. [308] showed that the formate path was preferable 
over the Cu-LaO x interface compared to the hydrocarboxyl path as 
depicted in Fig. 21 . It was reported that 81.2% methanol selectivity 
at 6% CO 
2 conversion was achieved during 100 h. LaO x enhanced 
Cu dispersion and consequently improved CO 

2 adsorption.

Yao et al . [309] showed that synergy between Cu (active in H 
2 
dissociation) and In 
2 adsorption) resulted in 
3 (responsible for CO 
79.7% selectivity towards methanol at 250 °C. Two RDS paths com- 
prising  formate  formation  via  CO 
2  hydrogenation  and  methanol 
formation from methoxy were distinguished in the formate path- 
way as depicted in Fig. 22 . 

Wang et al . [310] proposed the use of visible light irradiation to 
excite electrons over Cu-ZnO and demonstrated that reaction inter- 
mediates activated easier. Accordingly, a 40% reduction in the ac- 
tivation energy along with a 54% increase in methanol production 
was attributed to photo-mediated catalysis via the formate path- 
way as illustrated in Fig. 23 . 

As a promoter, ZnO could enhance the stabilization and disper- 
sion  of  Cu  [311–313] ,  with  lattice  oxygen  vacancies,  in  ZnO  and 
lattice electron pairs active in methanol formation [284] . Fujita et 
al.  [314]  reported  high  selectivity  toward  methanol  (67.2%)  over 
Cu/ZnO as a result of high Cu dispersion and formation of Cu (111) 
and  Cu  (100)  ﬂat  surfaces.  Employing  solvated  metal  atom  dis- 
persion (SMAD) method, Ponce et al. [315] prepared Cu nanocrys- 
talline  (NC)  particles  to  fabricate  Cu/pentane/NC–ZnO,  which  re- 
2  conversion  at  450  °C.  A  dual-site  mechanism 
sulted  in  80%  CO 
has been proposed for methanol synthesis over Cu/ZnO catalysts, 
where Cu is responsible for hydrogen dissociation and ZnO acti- 
vates CO 
2 in the form of bicarbonate. In addition, ZnO x sites are ac- 
tive in methanol formation while ZnO species favor CO production 
[316–318] . In order to further increase the eﬃciency of the Cu/ZnO

The formation of Cu + , which is an intermediate state, was reported 
due to the small Ga 
3 particle size [ 319 , 320 ]. In addition, the uti- 
lization of methoxide-acetylacetonate instead of nitrate precursor 
resulted in better Cu dispersion in Cu–Ga/ZnO catalyst [320] . No- 
ble metals have been reported to have great potential for hydro- 
gen activation via the hydrogen-spillover mechanism. Accordingly, 
Pd was used for the modiﬁcation of Cu/Zn/Al 
3 and Cu/ZnO cat- 
alysts [ 321 , 322 ], which by forming a highly reduced catalyst sur- 
face accelerated the hydrogenation process [321] . To eﬃciently en- 
hance  the  activity  and  durability  of  the  Cu/ZnO  catalysts,  Al 
2 O 
3 
has also been used as promoter or support [ 308 , 323–326 ]. How- 
ever, the catalyst performance has not been satisfactory since the 
hydrophilic Al 
3 resulted in water accumulation, which reduced 
the catalyst eﬃciency. Using kinetic modeling techniques, Wilkin- 
son et al . [327] studied the mechanism of methanol formation over 
Cu/ZnO/Al 
2  in the feed 
3  catalysts. They used both CO and CO 
and demonstrated that CO 
2 transferred to both CO and bidentate 
CO 
2  along with surface oxygen species ( Fig. 24 ), which results in 
the formation of carbonate and consequently methanol.

2 could stabilize tiny Cu particles, which also 
over, amorphous ZrO 
enhanced  Cu-ZrO 
2  interactions  and  led  to  higher  selectivity  to- 
wards methanol ( Fig. 25 ). The role of the crystal structure is still 
under  debate  since  both  t-(tetragonal)  and  m-(monoclinic)  ZrO 
2 
were able to modify the catalyst surface properties via changing 
the  formation  of  oxygen  vacancies  as  depicted  in  Fig.  25  [339] . 
In general, m-ZrO 
2 exhibits higher concentration of Brønsted cen- 
ter Zr–OH groups, stronger Lewis acidity of Zr 4 +  ions, as well as 
stronger Lewis basicity of O 2 − ions [ 341 , 342 ]. However, Zr crystal 
types can inﬂuence catalyst performance [ 343 , 344 ] and Cu/m-ZrO

3 O as active intermedi- 
increased concentration of HCOO and CH 
ates [344] . For instance, Cu/ZrO 
2 catalysts 
2 exhibit higher activity and methanol 
[345] prepared with m-ZrO 
selectivity than the counterparts prepared with t-ZrO 
2 . By contrast, 
Samson et al . [341] indicated that the methanol synthesis rate rises 
2  content, and the presence of oxygen vacan- 
with growing t-ZrO 
cies stabilizes the thermodynamically unstable t-ZrO 
2 phase at low 
temperature and Cu + ions.

Incorporation  of  other  components  such  as  Al,  B  and  Ga  de- 
creases  the  rate  of  water  adsorption,  and  improves  Cu  disper- 
sion along with the increasing concentration of ZrO 
2 , which en- 
hances catalyst activity [346–349] . Generally, Cu/ZnO offers higher 
2 provides higher selectivity towards 
CO 
2  has  been  proposed  to 
methanol.  Therefore,  ternary  Cu/ZnO/ZrO 
combine the two advantages [339] . Adsorption of CO 
2 on the ZrO 
2 
surface leads to bicarbonate formation, which can be transferred 
to formate intermediate via hydrogenation [350] . The required hy- 
drogen  for  this  step  could  be  supplied  by  hydrogen-spillover  on 
Cu  [ 351 , 352 ].  Kattel  et  al .  [353]  proposed  that  methanol  forma- 
tion  occurs  through  carboxyl  path  over  Cu/ZrO 
2  as  depicted  in 
Fig.  26  (a).  However,  a  “formate” pathway  was  proposed  over 
Cu/ZnO/ZrO 
2 [355] catalysts as can be ob- 
served in Fig. 26 (b) and (c).

Furthermore, the addition of MgO to Cu-ZnO-ZrO 

3 could 
prevent CH 
4 production via increasing alkali sites over the catalyst 
surface. Besides, this modiﬁcation resulted in the formation of Cu 0 , 
which is an active site for the CO 
2 hydrogenation to methanol syn- 
thesis [326] .

Using hydrophobic SiO 

2  as supports for multi-component cat- 
alysts led to stability and eﬃciency at temperatures up to 270 °C 
[319] . It was demonstrated that the addition of 1 wt% SiO 
2 to the 
CuO-ZnO-ZrO 
2 catalysts increased the methanol production activity 
of about 26% due to enhanced dispersion of components. In ad- 
dition, the RWGS reaction proceeded through a redox mechanism 
rather than the formate path as illustrated in Fig. 27 [356] . 

In  addition  to  Cu,  Au,  Pd,  In  and  Ag  were  among  the  ele- 
ments that provided superior activity in the CO 
2 hydrogenation to 
methanol [357–361] . Lin et al . [354] investigated the role of vari- 
ous supports on the performance of Pd-Cu catalysts. TiO 
2 and ZrO 
2 
3 catalysts exhibited the best methanol production 
supported PdCu 
capability compared to PdCu 
2 ( Fig. 28 ). This was attributed to 
strong CO 
2 adsorption sites which were provided by the abundant 
oxygen vacancies. 

3 /CeO 

Pd-ZnO/MWCNTs catalysts showed excellent performance in the 
methanol  production  due  to  increasing  Pd 0  concentration  as  ac- 
tive species [362] . Hydrogen could be adsorbed reversibly on these 
catalysts and increased the rate of surface hydrogenation by favor- 
ing higher active hydrogen concentration. Moreover, hydrogen that

was transferred to Ga 
3 after dissociation on Pd, could react with 
surface-bound molecules. Besides, forming Pd–Ga active sites fa- 
vored methanol production in the presence of the Pd/Ga 
3  cat- 
alyst [363–365] . In addition, Liaw et al . [260] reported that pro- 
moting CuB with Zr, Cr and Th could enhance the catalyst stability 
along with Cu dispersion, which led to enhanced methanol forma- 
tion. A comprehensive study was performed to recognize the inter- 
mediates for the synthesis of methanol from hydrogenation of CO 
2 
over various catalysts like Pd/ β-Ga 
3 using FT-IR spectroscopy in - 
situ [366] . The reaction followed the formate pathway that con- 
tinued via the formation of HCOO, H 
3 OH as 
the  ﬁnal  products  depicted  in  Fig.  29  (a).  Oxygen  vacancies  can 
be ﬁlled and generated with the formation of methanol and H 
2 , 
respectively,  which  results  in  a  mechanism  including  cyclic  for- 
mation and extinction of oxygen vacancies Fig. 29 (b). Tsoukalou 
et al . [272] studied the structural transition of In 
3  throughout 
CO 
2 hydrogenation using X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy 
(XANES),  extended  X-ray  absorption  ﬁne  structural  spectroscopy 
(EXAFS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Slight reduction of In–O coor- 
dination numbers along with partial reduction of In 
3 were de- 
tected during activation, in accordance with oxygen vacancy gener- 
ation, which led to the formation of In 
3 −x active phase. Further 
3 −x results in In 0 formation and ﬁ- 
reductive amorphization of In 
nally catalyst deactivation.

Chen et al. [291] performed a mechanistic investigation of CO

hydrogenation over In x /ZrO 
2 catalyst. This catalyst was capable of 
methanol  production  via  hydrogenation  of  HCOO.  However,  low 
loading ( < 0.5 wt%) catalysts were active in CO formation while 
higher loadings resulted in methanol synthesis as can be observed 
in Fig. 30 . Moreover, Martin et al . [269] showed that, introduction 
of CO in the feed ﬂow could increase the oxygen vacancies and 
2 catalysts. 
consequently enhance the performance of the In 
Zander et al . [368] concluded that active catalysts should ad- 
dress the requirements, comprising: high speciﬁc SA (surface area) 
Cu in order to display active sites; defective Cu surface including 
high-energy sites; and SMSI (strong metal–support interaction) in- 
duced cooperation of ZnO for the activation of defect sites as rep- 
resented in Scheme 6 . Therefore, a variety of studies have been re- 
ported with regard to the bi-functional catalysts consisting of Cu

selectivity  towards  methanol  due  to  strong  Cu-MOF  interactions. 
Secondary building units of Zr were better than ZrO 
2 metal oxides 
at Cu sites for methanol synthesis. 

The results of previous experimental works for methanol pro- 

duction from CO 

2 hydrogenation are displayed in Table 2 . 

Over  the  past  few  decades,  there  has  been  signiﬁcant  de- 
bate  regarding  the  reaction  routes  for  methanol  formation  from 
CO 
2 ,  which  has  focused  on  two  main  species,  speciﬁcally  car- 
boxyl (COOH ∗) and formate (HCOO ∗), whose formation starts with 
2 HOMO (1 π g) and 
separate primary hydrogenation steps. The CO 

LUMO (2 π u) orbitals are situated near to O and C atoms, respec- 
tively.  The  latter  is  recognized  as  a  poor  electron  donor  (Lewis 
base), while the former can be considered as a poor electron ac- 
2 can be transferred to COOH ∗ and HCOO ∗
ceptor (Lewis acid). CO 
via reacting with proton and hydride, respectively. Recently, some 
advances  have  been  made  for  detecting  the  main  intermediates, 
especially  for  Cu-based  catalysts  using  the  combination  of  com- 
putational approaches and in-situ characterization [306] . Therefore, 
an  improved  understanding  about  reaction  mechanisms  and  in- 
sight from theoretical studies can guide the design of more eﬃ- 
cient catalyst. This section includes mechanistic insights via both 
experimental and theoretical results, with special emphasis on cat- 
alysts containing transition and precious metals (monometallic Cu 
and  Cu/oxides).  Signiﬁcant  kinetic  models  are  included  to  pro- 
vide  instructions  for  mechanistic  investigations  from  an  experi- 
2 O 
mental viewpoints, and includes the inﬂuence of additional H 
on methanol synthesis activity. 

Yang et al . [375] investigated Cu(111), and Cu/ZnO (0 0 0 ¯1 ) cat- 
alytic activities in methanol formation and showed that supported 
Cu-NPs on a single ZnO(0 0 0 ¯1 ) crystal had higher activity. This high 
activity  was  attributed  to  the  stabilization  of  formate  species  in

the presence of Cu-NP sites. The formation of formate intermedi- 
ate  is  kinetically  favored in CO 
2  hydrogenation, which results  in 
methanol formation over Cu surfaces. The design strategy is pro- 
posed via combining experimental investigations and DFT, where 
introducing promoters or dopants can ﬁx formyl or promote for- 
mate  and  dioxomethylene  hydrogenation,  and  might  be  capable 
of enhancing methanol yield [375] . Based on this theory, Yang et 
al .  [376]  studied  the  inﬂuence  of  doping  with  transition  metals

ter. Linear scaling relations were detected for binding energies of 
O ∗ and CO ∗ with the activation barriers of  the primary steps  of 
2 hydrogenation. Varying cluster sizes 
methanol formation from CO 
alters the d-band center of Cu clusters, which modiﬁes the adsorp- 
tion stabilities for reaction species, leading to size-dependent activ- 
ity of methanol synthesis, with smaller clusters more active [379] . 
In addition, defects in Cu-based catalysts were identiﬁed to have 
an  important  role  on  the  methanol  formation  activity/selectivity 
[380] . On the kink and step surfaces of Cu(211), barriers for CO 
2 
hydrogenation to COOH ∗ and HCOO ∗ were considerably lower than 
observed  on  Cu(111)  terraces.  Over  Cu(111),  COOH ∗ and  HCOO ∗
were competitive, while the Cu(211) surfaces promotes preferen- 
tial HCOO ∗ formation. When a Cu atom on the surface of Cu(211) 
was replaced with a single Zn atom, methanol synthesis activity 
was remarkably enhanced. This enhancement was a consequence 
of the easier HCOO ∗ formation via CO 
2 hydrogenation in addition 
to reinforcing the binding energies of main intermediates contain- 
ing O like HCOO ∗ over surfaces modiﬁed with Zn.

on Cu(111) to produce methanol via CO 
2  hydrogenation. The DFT 
studies revealed that the yield of methanol increased in the fol- 
lowing  order:  Au/Cu(111)  <  Cu(111)  <  Pd/Cu(111)  <  Ph/Cu(111) 
< Pt/Cu(111) < Ni/Cu(111). The path within RWGS + CO-Hydro in- 
cluding a COOH ∗ species moved forward more rapidly than that 
through the HCOO ∗ intermediate, showing that addition of dopants 
could  change  the  controlling  path  of  methanol  formation.  The 
same results were indicated by Liu et al . [377] about the enhance- 
ment of methanol synthesis via adding Rh as dopant, in different 
amounts, over Cu(111). Accordingly, the adsorption intensity of the 
main  species  could  be  changed,  the  rate-determining  step  (RDS) 
was  altered,  and  byproduct  (CO)  yield  was  reduced,  resulting  in 
promoted kinetics for the methanol production. Besides the effect 
of doping, the size of Cu-NP clusters were inﬂuential in methanol 
formation path. Zhang et al . [378] anticipated that medium-sized 
Cu19 cluster had the maximum activity in CO 
2  hydrogenation to 
methanol among other Cu clusters like Cu(111), Cu13, Cu(211) and 
2  and modest surface 
Cu55. A lower decomposition barrier of CO 
coverage were reported to explain the high activity of Cu19 clus-

Grabow  et  al .  [381]  performed  an  extensive  mechanistic 
investigation  of  methanol  formation  over  Cu(111)  via  hy- 
drogenation  of  CO  and  CO 
2  through  combining  microkinetic 
modeling  and  DFT.  Possible  routes  are  suggested,  where 
2  hydrogenation  to  methanol  proceeds  in  the  order  of 
CO 
3 OH ∗
∗ → HCOO ∗ → HCOOH ∗ → H 
CO 
2 
( Fig.  32 ),  which  was  not  the  same  as  reported  by  Yang  et  al . 
[375] where HCOO ∗ → H 
2 CO ∗ were deemed as primary 
steps in the route based on formate. The formation of methanol 
3 O ∗ hydrogenation  in  streams  rich 
could  be  restricted  via  CH 
in  CO 
2  hydrogenation  via  either 
OH ∗ removal  via  the  WGS  reaction  or  through  a  HCO ∗ path  for 
methanol synthesis [381] . Yang et al . [382–384] studied the mech- 
anism  and  the  water  inﬂuence  in  methanol  formation  through 
hydrogenation of CO 
2 -containing syngas over Cu catalysts. 
A thorough scheme comprising probable reaction steps originated 
2 + CO  or  pure  CO 
2 /CO  hydrogenations  is 
from  either  mixed  CO 
displayed  in  Fig.  33 .  Methanol  synthesis  via  CO 
2  hydrogenation 
mostly  goes  through  the  “formate” route  (left  path),  while  a 
formyl-based  route  is  taken  when  CO  replaces  CO 
2  (right  path). 
The  proposed  mechanism,  whereby  CO ∗ is  formed  through  car- 
boxyl via O–CO bond activation and decomposition is above this 
scheme  [381] .  In  addition,  a  “middle” route,  suggested  by  Zhao 
et al . [296] probably appears via carboxyl in CO 
2  hydrogenation, 
which  is  more  kinetically  favorable  as  a  result  of  lower  energy 
barriers  as  shown  by  DFT.  Kattel  et  al .  [305]  investigated  active 
sites of methanol formation from CO 
2 hydrogenation over Cu/ZnO. 
Comparison of ZnCu and ZnO/Cu catalysts was performed via in- 
tegrating KMC (kinetic Monte Carlo) simulations, DFT calculations 
and  XPS  (X-ray  photoemission  spectroscopy)  measurements.  Re- 
sults revealed that the formate path was feasible over ZnCu(211), 
which  was  in  accordance  with  the  results  described  by  Behrens 
et  al .  [385] .  The  surface  of  ZnO/Cu(111)  also  could  promote  the 
formate path compared to the “RWGS + CO-Hydro” pathway, while 
CO was the main product as a result of reduced binding strength 
of CO ∗ that prevented its hydrogenation to HCO ∗ [305] . 

As  mentioned  previously,  two  feasible  routes  namely  HCOO ∗
and  COOH ∗ have  remained  under  discussion.  Formate  interme- 
diate  is  deemed  a  signiﬁcant  species  in  the  methanol  formation 
over  Cu  catalysts  as  adsorption  of  formate  and  its  hydrogena- 
tion  to  methoxy  intermediates  are  observed  via  FT-IR  spectra 
[ 386 , 387 ].  However,  Clarke  et  al .  [388]  revealed  the  effect  of 
carboxyl  species  in  methanol  synthesis,  suggesting  that  car- 
boxyl  could  proceed  by  isomerization  to  form  the  formate, 
and  subsequently  methanol.  Nevertheless,  carboxyl  intermedi- 
ates  were  barely  observed  in  DRIFTS,  showing  the  necessity 
of  operando  transient  techniques.  Several  investigations  em- 
phasized  the  inﬂuence  of  various  oxide  supports  except  ZnO,

Water  is  one  of  the  byproducts  of  the  CO 

2  hydrogenation, 
and  its  accumulation  leads  to  Cu-ZnO  catalyst  deactivation  as  a 
result  of  sintering  [ 391 , 392 ],  particularly  at  high  CO 
2  conversion 
[ 393 , 394 ].  Unfortunately,  their  utilization  as  low-temperature 
catalysts is hampered by accumulation of carbon-derived species 
2 O  could  impose 
[395] .  Conversely,  other  studies  showed  that  H 
a  positive  inﬂuence  or  even  contribute  in  methanol  synthe- 
sis.  Zhao  et  al .  [296]  investigated  the  effect  of  water  in  the 
methanol  synthesis  over  Cu(111)  using  DFT.  Immediate  formate 
hydrogenation  over  Cu(111)  was  unfavorable  because  of  high 
2 COO ∗
activation  barriers  of  consecutive  steps  like  HCOO ∗ to  H 
2 CO ∗,  whereas  hydrogenation  of  CO 
and  H 
2  to  a 
trans-COOH ∗ species  was  feasible  kinetically.  Especially,  when 
one  molecule  of  H 
2 O  was  considered  in  calculations,  formation 
of  COOH ∗ continued  via  a  unique  mechanism,  where  the  ad- 

2 COO ∗

to  H 

sorbed  hydrogen  of  surface  was  transferred  to  water  molecules 
that  simultaneously  gave  one  of  its  protons  to  the  CO 
2 .  Water 
participation  in  this  reaction  could  remarkably  decrease  the 
barrier  of  hydrogenation  from  1.16  to  0.17  eV.  In  the  vicin- 
ity  of  water,  the  favorable  route  of  methanol  formation  was 
suggested  to  proceed  via  the  following  sequence  of  reactions: 
2 O) → trans-COOH ∗ + 5H ∗ → t,t-COHOH ∗ + 4H ∗ → t,

HCOH ∗ + 3H ∗ + OH ∗ → H 
→ H 
2  or  its 
mixture with CO via experimental and computational techniques 
was investigated by Yang et al . [383] . Results revealed that both 
H 
2 O-derived intermediates acted as crucial reactants and 
co-reactants in the RWGS and methanol synthesis on Cu surface. 
The mentioned reactions could be promoted via addition of small 
amounts of H 
2 O (approximately 0.04–0.5% mole fraction). Recently, 
Wang et al. [396] showed strong evidence about the positive effect

CZZ  (M-CZZ)  with  improved  diffusion  of  water  vapor  showed 
considerably  enhanced  methanol  formation  rates  and  selectivity 
compared to those over CZZ catalyst fabricated by coprecipitation 
(C-CZZ), as shown in Table 2 [93] . 

Nie et al. [397] investigated the inﬂuence of water on the sur- 
face of alloyed PdCu(111) using both experimental and DFT stud- 
ies and reported that H 
2 O was able to affect the elementary en- 
ergetics  and  surface  chemistry.  The  presence  of  a  small  fraction 
of  H 
2 O  reduced  kinetic  barriers  via  altering  “H-transfer” mecha- 
nism in hydrogenation reactions ( Fig. 35 (a,b)), along with chang- 
ing the RDS. According to Fig. 35 (c,d), water participated in the 
process and remarkably  inﬂuenced the  formation of O –H bonds, 
while having a negligible role on the formation of C –H bonds. H 
2 O 
reduced the activation barrier of primary RDSs, HCOO ∗ → HCOOH ∗, 
from  1.28  eV  to  0.58  eV  in  the  “formate” pathway.  In  addi- 
tion, water shifted the RDS to HCOOH ∗ → H 
2 COOH ∗ (0.82 eV) as 
a  C –H  bond  formation  step.  In  the  “RWGS + CO-Hydro” path  via 
COOH ∗ species,  water  contributed  in  primary  steps,  comprising 
2 O ∗, along with the methanol formation

tion  proceeded more  quickly  compared to  the  CH 
3 OH  formation 
2 O contribution, which was in accordance with experimen- 
with H 
2 O for 
tal results. The synergetic role of a proper concentration of H 

methanol formation was supported by experimental investigations 
in this study [398] . 

2 O/H 

Recently, Xu et al . [399] studied the effect of H 

2 O-derived 
intermediates in methanol synthesis over Cu(211) via microkinetic 
modeling along with DFT calculations. In contrast to Cu(111)-based 
catalysts [ 400 , 401 ], the presence of water in the vicinity of Cu(211) 
increased  the  energy  barriers  of  HCOO ∗ and  COOH ∗ formation. 
However, the presence of water-derived intermediates like O ∗ and 
OH ∗ over  Cu(211)  increased  the  turnover  frequency  of  methanol 
synthesis that was ascribed to the reduced adsorption of formate 
as a surface poisoning intermediate and decreased energies of the 
rate-controlling  states.  On  the  basis  of  Gibbs  free  energy  barri- 
ers, introducing water as the source of hydrogen via O –H break- 
age could not promote CO 
2 hydrogenation, as proposed by Jiang et 
al. [93] which is not consistent with suggestions from earlier stud- 
ies [ 397 , 400 , 401 ], where water acted as a “H shuttling medium”
from Cu surfaces to the CO 
2 . However, Martin et al . [269] demon- 
3 -based 
strated that the decrease in the reaction rate on the In 
catalysts was only 20% in the presence of water, which was consid- 
erably lower compared to that of Cu-ZnO-Al 
3 (70%). Accordingly, 
In 
3 -based catalyst may be a promising alternative for Cu-based 
catalysts for methanol production in the harsh environment.

yield  [403–405] .  As  a  whole,  increasing  reaction  pressure,  space 
velocity and H 
2 hy- 
drogenation [ 406 , 407 ]. Thermodynamically, high pressure is favor- 
2 conversion while eﬃciently reducing the reactor vol- 
able for CO 
ume and plant area, which decreases the total capital cost. How- 
ever, due to safety considerations, pressure increases from ambi- 
ent up to 10 MPa. Recently, advantages of high-pressure methods 
in CO 
2 hydrogenation to methanol were experimentally conﬁrmed 
[ 408 , 409 ]. At 260 °C and 331 bar (partial pressure of the reactants), 
2  conversion  (about  95%)  along  with  approxi- 
extremely  high  CO

mately 98% methanol selectivity were achieved on Cu/ZnO/Al

weight time yield (WTY) was achieved at GHSV of 182 0 0 0 h −1 at 
the cost of lower CO 
2 conversion (65.8%) and methanol selectivity 
(77.3%) ( Table 2 ). The effects of phase behavior, kinetics and ther- 
modynamics on methanol production were also investigated, and 
at 442 bar, WTY of 15.3 g 

−1 h −1 was achieved [409] .

Gaikwad et al . [409] studied the inﬂuence of temperature on 
methanol  formation  at  different  pressures  from  46  to  442  bar 
when  GHSV = 10 0 0 0  h −1  ( Fig.  36 ).  In  addition,  reactor  perfor- 
mance at thermodynamic equilibrium was also represented (dot- 
ted  lines).  It  was  observed  that  at  lower  pressure  (46  bar),  CO 
2 
conversion decreased slightly (from about 30 to 20%) with tem- 
perature  increase  (from  220  to  300  °C),  while  methanol  selec- 
tivity  decreased  considerably  from  about  90  %  to  20%.  Elevated 
pressure,  led  to  improved  methanol  selectivity  and  CO 
2  conver- 
sion, with selectivity found to be approximately constant over the 

28 

entire temperature range explored, highlighting the advantage of 
high pressure conditions. For instance, at 442 bar, CO 
2 conversion 
was between 86.1% and 98.7%, while selectivity towards methanol 
varied  between  99%  and  99.9%  at  the  studied  temperature 
range. 

The usual gas-phase process suffers from some drawbacks like 
catalyst deactivation due to sintering, the required recycling of un- 
converted gas due to thermodynamic equilibrium, and the slight 
one-pass CO 
2 conversion restricted by the huge heat release dur- 
ing the reaction [251] . Therefore, innovation in process technology 
is of great practical importance in CO 

2 hydrogenation. 

By  the  end  of  the  1970s,  a  liquid-phase  methanol  (LPMeOH) 
production method from syngas was developed by Air Products & 
Chemicals [410] . The operation of the LPMeOH TM  Demonstration 
Unit, which is located at Eastman’s chemicals-from-coal complex in 
Tennessee, USA began in 1997. In this process, a slurry bubble col- 
umn reactor (SBCR) is used, while an inert solvent (high-boiling- 
point mineral oil) enters the reactor to release the heat of exother- 
mal  reactions.  The  reactant  gas  bubbles  up  through  the  catalyst 
slurry to suspend the catalyst in mineral oil. Water and methanol 
can be separated from the solvent via cooling, while the solvent is 
recycled to the reactor. The liquid-phase methanol production ex- 
hibits several beneﬁts like [ 411 , 412 ] (i) eﬃcient heat release from 
exothermic reaction and excellent reactor temperature tuning, (ii) 
high conversion per pass, which reduces the recycle ratio of unre- 
acted gas while keeping the recycle ratio lower than that in normal 
gas-phase reactors, (iii) and moderate process temperature, which 
leads to higher catalyst stability while restricting catalyst deactiva- 
tion due to hot spots.

Topsøe and Matthey Davy technologies offered the same designs. 
The  maximum  capacity  is  about  1500  to  2200  t/d.  Fig.  37  (b) 
demonstrates  the  Linde  Variobar  process,  where  the  catalyst  is 
loaded in the shell and boiling water circulates through the coil- 
wound  heat  exchanger.  This  design  was  reported  to  exhibit  the 
highest catalyst per reactor volume ratio among all isothermal re- 
actors. In addition, the high heat transfer coeﬃcient of this reactor 
can reduce the heat transfer area due to its cross ﬂow design. A 
multi-stage radial ﬂow (MRF) reactor was developed by Toyo En- 
gineering  Corporation  (TEC)  and  Mitsui  Toatsu  Chemicals  (MTC). 
The main feature of this design is the radial gas ﬂow across the 
shell,  which  is  ﬁlled  with  catalyst  and  cooled  by  bayonet  tubes 
( Fig. 37 (c)). A concentric cooling zone is formed via the tube ar- 
rangement. In addition, the pressure drop is very low (less than 0.5 
bar), which facilitates scale-up. Fig. 37 (d) displays the supercon- 
verter designed by Mitsubishi Gas Chemicals and Mitsubishi Heavy 
industries. This reactor is assembled by the double-pipe tubes in a 
boiling water vessel, which combines the properties of a tube gas 
cooling reactor and a steam raising tubular reactor. the feed gas is 
preheated before entering the catalyst bed, which results in a high 
temperature (250 to 260 °C) at the tube inlet. In Fig. 37 (e) the 
Methanol  Casale  Isothermal  Methanol  Converter  (IMC)  is  shown, 
where the feed gas, boiling water or their combination is used as 
coolant. The temperature of different parts can be controlled in- 
dependently by the level of the cooling ﬂuid, and the maximum 
reaction rate curve can be achieved accordingly. For high capac- 
ities  (70 0 0  to  10 0 0 0  t/d)  axial-radial  ﬂow  is  required  to  reduce 
the pressure drop, while for lower capacities (about 20 0 0 t/d) the 
axial ﬂow is preferred. For large capacities up to 10 0 0 0 t/d, Hal- 
dor Topsøe developed multi-stage adiabatic ﬁxed-bed reactors us- 
ing internal cooling ( Fig. 37 (f)). The dual stage or parallel reactors 
can also realize high capacity (50 0 0 t/d) axial ﬂow steam raising 
converters as illustrated in Fig. 37 (g), which is the Lurgi Mega- 
Methanol converter. In the ﬁrst reactor, which is a steam raising 
reactor,  the  feed  gas  is  partially  converted  to  methanol.  Further 
conversion occurs in the tubular reactor, which is cooled by the 
feed gas. Accordingly, a small feed preheater is required. Air Prod- 
ucts designed the Liquid Phase Methanol (LPMeOH) reactor ( Fig. 37 
(f)) for 235 t/d, which is a slurry bubble reactor. The catalyst par- 
ticles are suspended in a mineral oil, which is inert and facilitates 
the heat transfer. An internal heat exchanger is used to remove the 
reaction heat, which provides approximately isothermal operation. 
However, the limited loading of catalyst results in a poor utiliza- 
tion of the reactor volume [415]. 

The tubular reactor (like the Lurgi and Haldor Tøpsoe) removes 
the  heat  released  from  the  catalyst  through  boiling  water.  This 
type of reactor can quickly control reaction temperature while ap- 
proaching the optimum reaction rate path. Almost isothermal na- 
ture of this reactor guarantees high CO 
2 conversion as well as cat- 
alyst  stability,  due  to  low  operating  temperature  that  can  miti- 
gate the sintering rate. However, mechanically complicated design 
imposes  high  investment  costs  and  restricts  the  maximum  size. 
In  addition,  the  series  spherical  adiabatic  reactors  conﬁgured  by 
Haldor Tøpsoe and Kellogg have beneﬁts with respect to cylindri- 
cal reactors in lower pressure drop, lower reactor cost and higher 
methanol  formation  rate  [416] .  Furthermore,  mitigating  the  im- 
pacts of thermal conﬂicts, recycle reactors yielded the highest CO 
2 
conversion. In addition, Moioli et al . [417] concluded that the cas- 
cade  reactor  could  be  the  best  candidate  for  the  production  of 
methanol and methane. 

As mentioned above, the unfavorable equilibrium has been the 
main problem regarding methanol production. Bos et al. [ 418 , 419 ] 
proposed  a  two-temperature-zone  concept  for  methanol  produc- 
tion to shift the equilibrium. The ﬁrst zone was the reactor (about 
200 °C) and the second one was condenser (about 100 °C). How- 
ever,  further  studies  are  required  to  optimize  the  dimensions  of

In addition, the Research Institute of Innovative Technology for 
the Earth (RITE) and the National Institute for Resources and En- 
vironment  (NIRE)  investigated  liquid-phase  methanol  production 
from CO 
2  on  Cu/ZnO catalysts in  the presence of  a  hydrophobic 
solvent (e.g. hydrocarbon oil) based on the liquid–liquid separation 
[94] . Besides, recycling of unreacted gas to reactor can be essen- 
tially omitted as a result of high methanol yield (about 95%). In 
addition, various approaches like coating of methyl hydrogen sili- 
cone oil, hydrothermal treatment and addition of hydrophobic sil- 
ica and graphite) have been developed to improve catalyst stability. 
The  liquid-phase  process  has  great  potential;  however,  emphasis 
should be placed on catalyst development at moderate tempera- 
tures with respect to those in common gas-phase processes. 

3.3. Reactor design and developments 

According to Table 2 , in addition to reasonable design of cat- 
alysts with adequate eﬃciency, innovation in reactor design is of 
paramount signiﬁcance in improving CO 
2 hydrogenation eﬃciency. 
A variety of designs have been investigated to obtain low outlet 
temperature, low catalyst volume, low by-product formation and 
heat recovery at high temperatures [413] . However, the key issue 
in reactor design for CO 
2 hydrogenation is removing the released 
heat of the exothermic reaction. Moreover, using a semi-batch au- 
toclave reactor, Liu et al . [414] showed a methanol selectivity of 
72.9% with CO 
2  conversion of about 25.9% at 170 °C and 5 MPa 
over copper catalyst. Presently, the reactors used for methanol pro- 
duction through CO 
2  hydrogenation are fundamentally similar to 
those utilized in methanol production by syngas. Three main reac- 
tors for customary methanol production are illustrated in Fig. 37 . 

In the Lurgi design ( Fig. 37 (a)), the feed gas enters the tubes 
axially,  and  boiling  water  removes  the  heat  of  reaction.  Haldor

were also proposed as another method to overcome equilibrium 
limitation via in-situ water sorption [420] . Moreover, on the lab- 
oratory scale, continuous ﬂow stirred-tank reactors or slurry au- 
toclave reactors are employed in the liquid phase CO

tion, with solvents comprising DMF, squalane, water, 1,4-dioxane,

3.3.1. Reactor innovations – membrane reactors 

In order to prevail the equilibrium limitation of the RWGS re- 
action, several approaches such as enhancing the overall reaction 
rate, improving methanol yield along with decreasing the recycle 
ratio of the unconverted gas, product removal through a selective 
membrane  (using  membrane  reactor  (MR))  was  suggested  [431–
433] . In fact, using MR, results in continuous removal of water va- 
por  from  reactor,  leading to  enhanced methanol yield.  Many  re- 
searchers have focused on the utilization of MRs in methanol syn- 
thesis from either experimental or modeling point of view to cir- 
cumvent  this  limitation.  MRs  exhibited  higher  yields  than  those 
obtained  in  traditional  ﬁxed-bed  reactors  under  the  same  oper- 
ating conditions [ 434 , 435 ]. Simulating methanol production from 
CO 
2 hydrogenation in a silicone rubber/ceramic composite MR cou- 
pling with experimental data, Chen et al . [436] demonstrated that 
CO 
2  conversion  in  MR  increased  by  22%  with  respect  to  that  of 
ﬁxed-bed  reactor.  Furthermore,  several  research  groups  have  re- 
ported the improvement of methanol yield and selectivity in MRs 
using different membranes [437–439] . Nevertheless, all of the pre- 
vious researchers have focused on the single reactors, while com- 

30 

paring three different reactor types in similar conditions proposed 
a dual-type MR, which could adjust reactor temperature and en- 
hance  the  lifetime  and  activity  of  the  catalyst  [31] .  Besides,  us- 
ing MRs resulted in overcoming the limitation of thermodynamic 
equilibrium along with enhancing kinetics-limited reactions [31] . 
High conversion per run, high heat transfer eﬃciency and excel- 
lent adaptability to CO 
2  at low operation costs were reported as 
other advantages of MRs [4 40-4 42] . 

2 /CO 

Mechanical stability of various membranes like perﬂuorinated 
cation  exchange  materials  (e.g.  Li-Naﬁon  membranes  (DuPont) 
[443] , Li-Naﬁon hollow ﬁber membranes [444] ) and a water perm- 
selective ceramic membrane (silica/alumina composite membrane) 
2  conversion along with high 
reactor were explored. Improved CO 
methanol  yield  were  reported  employing  a  zeolite  MR  at  differ- 
2  feed ratios and temperatures compared to a conven- 
ent H 
tional reactor [ 438 , 445 ]. Saeidi et al. [31] investigated CO 
2 hydro- 
genation to methanol and gas-to-liquid (GTL) process using three 
different  reactor  types,  and  showed  that  a  dual-type  membrane 
reactor with H 
2 perm-selective membranes reactors dis- 
played  considerable  enhancement  in  the  yield  of  methanol  and 
gasoline production. However, the stability of membranes was not 
suﬃcient, and the optimal temperature and pressure of MR were 
generally lower than those of typical ﬁxed-bed reactors. Using a 
H 
2 O perm-selective membrane in the ﬁrst reactor led to enhanced 
reactor performance with respect to conventional reactors. In ad- 
dition, using H 
2  perm-selective membranes in ﬁrst and 
second  reactors,  respectively,  resulted  in  the  maximum  gasoline 
and methanol eﬃciency. Moreover, methanol synthesis suited bet- 
ter with this reactor conﬁguration compared to the GTL process in 
terms of conversion [31] .

comprise  the  structural,  chemical  and  thermal  durability  of  the 
membrane at rather severe conditions (177–300 °C and 3–5 MPa) 
CO 
2 hydrogenation to methanol. Polymeric materials are frequently 
used for membrane fabrication, but they are not viable in severe 
reaction conditions [ 4 4 4 , 4 47 ]. Zeolite-based membranes were con- 
sidered  potential  candidates  in  this  regard,  as  a  result  of  their 
chemical  and  thermal  stability  [93] .  In  addition,  zeolites  exhibit 
uniform, molecular-sized pores, high porosity, adsorption property 
and shape selectivity. 

A  tubular  membrane  reactor  with  Naﬁon  membranes  for 
2 hydrogenation over Cu/Zn was stud- 
methanol production via CO 
ied by Struis et al. [ 4 4 4 , 4 47 ]. The feed gas entered the inner shell 
of the membrane reactor, while an inert gas was introduced into 
the  outer  shell  counter  currently  to  sweep  permeating  compo- 
nents [93] . Higher CH 
3 OH yield using MR was observed with re- 
spect to that without membrane at 200 °C and 0.43 MPa in the 
whole range of GHSV. However, inadequate stability of the poly- 
meric membrane restricted its execution. Furthermore, preserving 
the structure while retaining the quality at rather higher pressures 
has been challenging. Van Tran et al . [448] showed that for a mix- 
2 O, the NaA membrane exhibited 
ture of CO 
low permeability and thus high selectivity toward H 
3 OH 
compared  to  MFI  membranes.  However,  using  a  NaA  membrane 
resulted in higher methanol yield and selectivity at a wide range 
of operating conditions compared to conventional reactors, even at 
high pressures. Gallucci et al . showed that employing a zeolite MR 
led to  higher CO 
2  conversion with respect to conventional reac- 
tors [439] , while the improved performance could be kept at high 
pressure (2 MPa) Tavolaro et al . also reported enhanced CO 
2 con- 
version in a membrane reactor using hydrophilic LTA (Linde Type 
A) zeolite composite membrane [449] . At 210 °C, CO 
2  conversion 
in membrane reactor approached 17%, which exceeded the equilib- 
rium value of about 6%.

The  MR  was  employed  in  the  indirect  methanol  production 
path (RWGS + CO hydrogenation). The membrane-assisted CAMERE 
(methanol formation through RWGS reaction) process exhibited an 
analogous methanol synthesis rate with that of CAMERE process, 
showing 20% enhancement with respect to traditional reactors. In 
2 O formation rate was reduced by 38% with respect 
addition, the H 
to the CAMERE process. A decrease in H 
2 O formation rate was es- 
pecially promising in extending catalyst lifetime. 

Recent  studies  have  focused  mainly  on  separating  water- 
permanent  mixtures  at  elevated  pressures  and  temperatures 
[ 437 , 446 , 450 ].  This  research  has  been  extended  to  the  separa- 
tion  of  mixtures  containing  higher  alcohols  through  MFI  mem- 
branes [451] . The development of this area has been reported to 
be promising while providing economic proﬁt, since higher alco- 
hols syntheses are more favorable compared to methanol synthesis 
under the same conditions [ 49 , 452 ].

3.3.2. Magnetic ﬁeld-assisted reactor 

As  a  result  of  inadequate  kinetic  rates  at  low  temperatures, 
CO 
2  conversion to methanol is associated with high energy con- 
sumption to preserve high activity, which is not environmentally 
sustainable [ 453 , 454 ]. In this regards, utilization of external mag- 
netic ﬁeld has been proposed as a potential approach to decrease 
the energy intake. The external magnetic ﬁeld is beneﬁcial to avoid 
magnetic particle agglomeration while eliminating channeling and 
slugging as well as decreasing the apparent activation energy [93] . 
External  magnetic  ﬁeld  was  employed  in  the  CO 
2  conversion  to 
methanol over CuZnZr catalysts by Donphai et al. [455] . Different 
intensities of magnetic ﬁeld (0 to 27.7 mT) as well as orientations 
(i.e.,  N-S  and  the  reversed  S–N)  were  studied.  The  reaction  rate 
was  enhanced  via  using  a  magnetic  ﬁeld  particularly  at  higher 
temperatures (more than 200 °C). The optimal performance was 
achieved in the S-N orientation at magnetic intensity of 20.8 mT. 
Enhanced  eﬃciency  by  utilization  of  magnetic  ﬁeld  reduced  the 
energy  consumption,  which  provides  potential  to  mitigate  CO 
2 
emissions [93] . This performance improvement can originate from 
2  adsorption  along  with  a  reduced  activation  barrier  due  to 
CO 
magnetic ﬁeld. Similar results were obtained by the same group 
using  the  magnetic  ﬁeld  for  enhanced  CO 
2  conversion  in  the 
presence of Cu-Fe/ZSM-5 [456] . The presence of a magnetic ﬁeld 
resulted  in  the  formation  of  methanol,  DME  and  ethane  while 
methane  and  CO  were  the  main  products  in  the  absence  of  the 
magnetic ﬁeld ( Fig. 38 ). In addition, CO 
2 conversion and methanol 
selectivity were enhanced 1.7 and 2.24 times, respectively at about 
220 °C. These conclusions conﬁrmed the potential impact of mag- 
netic ﬁeld integration on thermocatalytic conversion of CO 
2 . Future 
research should be mostly focused on developing knowledge about 
correlating  surface  chemistry  and  magnetic  ﬁelds,  which  may 
provide  leading  principles  to  tailor  the  appropriate  catalysts  as 
well as optimizing the whole process. 

4. Hydrocarbons synthesis 

The transformation of CO 

2  to light alkanes and alkenes com- 
prises two indirect pathways: modiﬁed Fischer-Tropsch (MFT) pro- 
2  hy- 
cess, and methanol-mediated route. In the MFT process, CO 
drogenation  results  in  CO  formation  (RWGS)  and  further  hydro- 
genation of CO (FT) leads in the formation of hydrocarbons [457] . 
However, in the second route, methanol is the product of CO 
2 hy- 
drogenation,  which  is  converted  to  hydrocarbons  via  further  hy- 
drogenation. Obviously, different active sites are required in each 
reaction pathway [ 458 , 459 ]. These products would be exploited as 
petrochemical building blocks or liqueﬁed petroleum gas (LPG). In 
the  MFT  pathway,  the  competition  between  CO 
2  and  CO  for  H 
2 
consumption  should  be  considered  as  an  important  issue  [460] .

4 . Consequently, hydrogenation of CO and CO 

based catalysts was investigated by Zhang et al . [461] under typi- 
cal FT conditions. CO 
2 hydrogenation is slow in the presence of CO. 
Almost identical catalytic activities, but different selectivities were 
achieved via feeding only CO 
2 or CO. In CO hydrogenation, product 
distribution was observed with α (chain growth) factor of around 
2  hydrogenation about 70% of products were 
0.80, whereas in CO 
CH 
2 undergo different 
reaction pathways. Moreover, they differ concerning catalyst sta- 
bility since deactivation occurs slower using CO 
2  despite a larger 
2 (minimum two times) compared to CO hydrogena- 
ratio of H 
2 O/H 
2 or CO hydrogenation resulted in the same 
tion [21] . However, CO 
hydrocarbon products in the presence of the Fe-Cu-K-Al 
3  cata- 
lyst [462] . Different behaviors of Co-and Fe-based catalysts were 
attributed to their different roles in methane formation along with 
product desorption, which is necessary for chain growth. Fe-based 
catalysts  lead  to  irreversible  carbide  and  alkali  surface  coverage, 
while Co-containing catalysts result in strong reversible adsorption 
of CO. γ -Al 
3 was the preferred support for Fe-based active site 
with K employed as a promoter [462] .

Despite extensive application of Fe-based catalysts in CO 
2  hy- 
drogenation, principal insight about the chemistry of the Fe –C –O 
system  and  its  consequences  on  rapid  deactivation  of  the  iron- 
based catalysts has yet to be developed. The multidisciplinary na- 
ture of the Fe-based catalysts results in a diverse range of chem- 
ical and physical deactivation [463] . The chemical deactivation of 
Fe-based catalysts results from the formation of spinel structure, 
which reduces the active sites. The deactivation of Fe–K/ γ -Al 
3 in 
hydrocarbon production via CO 
2 hydrogenation was investigated by 
Lee et al . [464] through M ˝ossbauer spectroscopy, HR-TEM, XPS and 
TPO. As reaction proceeds, the active χ -Fe 
3  phase was formed 
due  to  the  reduction  of  Fe 
3 ,  which  subsequently  transformed 
2 O 
to a non-active phase, θ -FeC 
3 . In the reactor inlet, the deactiva- 
tion  was  mostly  due  to  the  phase  transformations,  while  at  the 
outlet the main source of catalyst deactivation was attributed to 
sintering and coke deposition. Actually, active metal sintering and 
carbon deposition are the main reasons for physical deactivation, 
which can be restricted by the addition of steam as well as us- 
ing a higher H 
2 ratio. In fact, hydrogen reaction with carbon 
deposits can avoid the  catalyst  deactivation.  Besides, in  order  to 
reduce  the  metal  sintering  various  methods  such  as  using  sup- 
ports,  promoters  and/or  modifying  catalyst  synthesis  techniques 
have been used to increase the metal dispersion. 

2 /CO 

5 C 

For instance, it was observed that ZrO 

2  supported FeCo cata- 
lysts underwent severe metal sintering and consequently rapid de- 
activation, while polymetallic Fe-Co-Zr ﬁbers, which were synthe- 
sized via one-step electrospinning methods, exhibited high stabil- 
ity  [465] .  The  mentioned  synthesis  method  resulted  in  separate 
dispersion  of  Fe  and  Co  over  the  support,  which  mitigated  the 
probability of metal sintering. Encapsulation of active metals in ze- 
olites  [466]  or  metal  conﬁnement  in  nanotubes  [467]  were  also 
used to avoid metal sintering. It is noteworthy that, sintering was 
not considered as a main source of Fe-based catalyst deactivation 
[ 468 , 469 ].

2 . Moreover, the CO 

Iron  catalysts  form  iron  carbide  (Fe 

2 )  in-situ  as  the  ac- 
5 C 
tive  phase  during  CO 
2  hydrogenation  [470] .  The  lattice  parame- 
ters of both cobalt and iron carbides are functions of feed com- 
position  [471]  and  are  constant  for  CO/H 
2  while  decreasing  for 
2  reaction requires an initial reduc- 
CO 
tion in contrast to CO/H 
2  and 
CO 
2  reactions differ during the process, even if starting from 
the  same  catalytic  material.  In  general,  Co-based  catalysts  form 
mostly methane, whereas better results are obtained by Fe-based 
catalysts, which are similar to those with syngas feed. 

2 . Thus, effective catalysts for CO/H

2  hydrogenation  to  oleﬁns  under  atmospheric  pressure

over  3D  mesoporous  Co 
[472] .  Superior  activity  of  this  catalyst  was  attributed  to  lower 

3 O 

mass  diffusion  limitations,  pore  structure,  and  more  active 
sites. 

2 /H 

2  to  CO 

Their high performance to cost ratio makes Co-containing cat- 
alysts  favorable  as  going  forward  as  strong  candidates  owing  to 
their selectivity in FT synthesis. However, when changing the feed 
gas from  CO/H 
2 ,  Co  favors methanation instead of  FT 
catalysis [ 461 , 462 , 473 , 474 ]. In addition, mixed Fe-Co catalysts also 
2 hydrogena- 
show low selectivity towards hydrocarbons [471] . CO 
3 resulted in a product containing about 70 mol % 
tion over Co/Al 
methane [475] . CO and CO 
2 hydrogenation takes place through dif- 
ferent routes; in the former primarily O–H and C–H were formed 
while in the latter O–H and H–C–O intermediates were formed. Ac- 
cordingly, iron and γ -Al 
3 were recommended as active site and 
support, respectively while K was suggested as the promoter for 
CO 
2 hydrogenation, which proceeded via simultaneous RWGS and 
FT reactions [476–479] .

2 and C 

Combining Fe-based catalysts and zeolites could maximize the 
production of iso-alkanes. Rongxian et al . [480] reported the pro- 
duction of iso-alkanes via CO 
2 hydrogenation on Fe-Zn-Zr/HY. Ni et 
al. [481] observed that the same catalysts can be used for the pro- 
duction of different products. Accordingly, iso-butane can be pro- 
duced from propylene and methanol via the methanol to gasoline 
reaction while iso-pentane was formed through additive dimeriza- 
tion reactions of C 
3 . Through methanol-mediated path, CO 
2 
hydrogenation to methanol occurred on Cu–Zn-based catalysts fol- 
lowing by methanol transformation to other hydrocarbons such as 
gasoline [482] . Despite extensive studies for developing compos- 
ite catalysts, light alkanes constitute the major products as a re- 
sult  of  additional  hydrogenation  of  alkenes  [483] .  Generally,  the 
Anderson-Schulz-Flory (ASF) plots show the total hydrocarbon se- 
lectivity in both CO and CO 
2 hydro- 
genation did not obey a regular ASF distribution and differed from 
what happened in CO hydrogenation [485] . In the CO 
2 hydrogena- 
tion process a low C/H ratio can be achieved as a result of high 
chemical and thermal CO 
2 stability, which leads to a slow adsorp- 
tion rate of this molecule. This phenomenon leads to the hydro- 
genation of adsorbed intermediates, which results in methane for- 
mation and consequently reduced chain growth. Due to the signiﬁ- 
cance of reaction mechanism (comprising both endo- and exother- 
mic reactions along with catalyst deactivation) the effects of cata- 
2  hydrogenation to hydrocar- 
lyst and reactor conﬁguration on CO 
bons are investigated based on the results presented in Table 3 .

4.1. Effect of catalyst type on H 2 /CO 2 to hydrocarbons 

In this section, the inﬂuence of catalyst on hydrocarbons pro- 
duction  is  studied  based  on  previous  experimental  results.  In  a 
ﬁxed-bed reactor, a calculated equilibrium conversion of 72%, with 
experimental CO 
2 conversion levels between 46 to 53% was mea- 
sured by Riedel et al . [477] . In general, reported conversion levels 
were in the range of 19% to 6 8%. [4 86–4 89] . These variations in 
CO 
2 conversion levels can be attributed to the different catalysts, 
operating conditions and reactors. Methane was the most thermo- 
dynamically favored HC [477] , while a C 
5+ alkene selectivity of 
around 80% was commonly reported [ 28 , 462 , 477 , 488 ].

4.1.1. Modiﬁed Fischer-Tropsch (MFT) route 

For  many  years,  iron  oxides  have  been  exploited  as  FT  cata- 
lysts and were used in both WGS and RWGS reactions [ 4 90 , 4 91 ]. 
Fe-containing catalysts have gained much attention in hydrocarbon 
synthesis as a result of their high aﬃnity towards oleﬁns [ 465 , 492–
2  hydrogenation over iron catalyst has been revealed to 
496 ]. CO 
proceed through a two-step process including the CO 
2 conversion 
to CO via the RWGS reaction followed by chain growth in FT reac- 
tions [ 477 , 497 ]. In the FT synthesis, it was assumed that either the 
iron’s magnetite phase [498] or an amorphous oxide phase [499] is

3 performance in terms of both CO 

2 conversion (54.4%) along with higher hydrocarbon (C 

product distribution as presented in Table 3 . Supports are used as 
a stabilizer to hinder sintering or Ostwald ripening of the catalyst’s 
3 has been extensively utilized 
active sites during the process. Al 
as a catalyst support due to exhibiting high surface area, strength- 
ening the mechanical properties of active catalyst while suppress- 
ing active phase agglomeration [ 510 , 511 ]. Ding et al . [512] investi- 
gated the effect of hydroxyl distribution on the acid-base proper- 
3 and its consequences in hydrocarbon production 
ties of the Al 
through CO 
2 hydrogenation. More hydroxyl groups on the support 
surface resulted in a smaller size of iron carbides that exhibited 
higher CO 
5+ ) 
2 coating (9 wt%) increased Fe- 
selectivity (31.1%). In addition, a SiO 
+ hy- 
2 conversion and C 
K/Al 
2 
drocarbon selectivity to 63% and 74%, respectively. This is proba- 
bly due to increased catalyst hydrophobicity, which hampered the 
detrimental impact of water on the catalyst [513] . γ -Al 
3 showed 
the best performance followed by SiO 
2 when employed 
as  supports  [ 496 , 514 , 515 ].  γ -Al 
3  can  hinder  sintering  due  to 
2 O 
strong metal-support interactions resulting in well-dispersed cat- 
alyst  particles  [516] .  Moreover,  the  improved  performance  of  γ - 
Al 
3 -supported catalysts can be ascribed to the catalytically ac- 
tive catalyst-support phase [517] , according to which the improved 
catalyst  performance  as  well  as  the  signiﬁcant  difference  in  the 
promoting effect of K among other alkali metals can be explained. 
When  both  γ -Al 
3  and  K  were  used  as  parts  of  the  catalyst, 
the potassium alanate (KAlH 
4 ) phase appropriate for reversible H 
2 
sorption at moderate temperatures (250–300 °C) was formed [518] . 
4 would reduce the hydrogenation of surface 
The presence of KAlH 
carbonaceous species and thus act as an H 
2 -reservoir that would 
result in increased alkene formation, and decreased selectivity to- 
ward methane [486] . Sodium alanate (NaAlH 
4 ) is recognized for H 
2 
activation at much lower temperatures (around 150 °C) with re- 
spect to KAlH 
4 [518] , which limits its application at the tempera- 
tures required for FT reactors. 
It was revealed that Mo 

2 C can be used as both Co-catalyst and 
support in CO 
2 hydrogenation at low temperatures (135 to 200 °C) 
in liquid 1,4-dioxane solvent. It was observed that methanol with 
about  95%  selectivity  was  the  most  favorable  product  at  135  °C 
while as temperature increased selectivity towards ethanol (about 
15%)  and  hydrocarbons  (about  5  to  10%)  were  enhanced.  In  ad-

The difference in catalytic activity (about two-fold) of the Na 
and  K  promoted  iron-based  catalysts  [486]  cannot  be  attributed 
only  to  the  basicity  of  the  alkali  oxides  since  this  amounts  to 
about  18%  [519] .  Chemisorption  experiments  showed  that  in- 
2 adsorption [ 462 , 496 ] was observed

for K-promoted Fe–Al catalysts in accordance with the CO 
2 hydro- 
genation mechanism according to the surface basicity theory [464] . 
Nevertheless, since chemisorption experiments were performed at 
room  temperature,  no  conclusions  can  be  construed  about  the

[500] . In addition, Fe 
2 should be in proper ratios for

an eﬃcient reaction [ 430 , 501 ]. Albrecht et al . [502] showed that 
3  without  dopant  or  other  active  sites  synthesized  via 
bare  Fe 
cellulose templates could offer high selectivity (about 37%) to C 
2 - 
C 
2  conversion.  The  method  of  catalyst 
preparation affected the redox properties of iron oxide. Geng et al . 
[503]  proposed a  reaction scheme  over  the  active  sites  ( Fig.  39 ) 
where paths 1 and 3 show the RWGS and FT reactions. Since the 
RWGS reaction is reversible (path 2), reducing the water content 
via water removal (path 4) was suggested to enhance hydrocarbon 
formation. In addition, further adsorption and reaction of products 
can  result  in  chain  propagation  (path  5).  Ethane  re-adsorbed  on 
the catalyst and for chain growth in FTS, lower concentrations of 
2 -products were observed [504–506] . This phenomenon did not 
C 
occur in the ASF plots of the CO 
2  hydrogenation process, owing 
high C 

2 -product concentrations [477] . 

It was concluded that supported Fe catalysts exhibited high se- 
lectivity towards hydrocarbons (about 11%), while CO 
2 conversion 
was  quite  low  (about  16%).  However,  addition  of  another  metal 
such as Co, Cu or Ni to Fe could improve CO 
2 conversion [507] . It 
was speculated that combining Fe with another metal could prob- 
ably modify the catalyst adsorption properties. In addition, it was 
concluded that controlling the reactant (H 
2 ) coverage over 
the  metals  inﬂuenced  the  formation  of  C –C  bond  for  hydrocar- 
bon production. It was reported that, the hydrocarbon selectivity 
of bimetallic alumina supported Fe-Co catalysts was about 4 times 
higher than that of monometallic Fe [508] . Moreover, it was re- 
ported that the Fe-Cu bimetallic catalyst exhibited higher selectiv- 
ity towards C 
7 hydrocarbons compared to that of monometallic 
Fe catalyst, while lower undesired CH 

4 was formed [509] .

( Fig. 42 (b)), particle mixing ( Fig. 42 (c)) and separate loading of 
15Fe5K/SiC and 8Co/SiC catalysts ( Fig. 42 (d)) were investigated to 
assess the effect of Co and Fe intimacy on the product distribution. 
It was demonstrated that, higher intimacy between Fe and Co re- 
sulted in the production of more C 
2 + hydrocarbons due to easy CO 
spillover from iron oxide to Co. Whereas, long distances between 
the above-mentioned active sites led to the formation of CH 
4 as a 
result of low CO concentration on Co. Accordingly, Co-impregnated 
15Fe5K8Co/SiC exhibited the highest selectivity towards light hy- 
drocarbons  while  separate  loading  of  15Fe5K/SiC  and  8Co/SiC  in 
two reactors resulted in the highest methane selectivity. These re- 
sults show the signiﬁcance of reactor conﬁguration in addition to 
catalyst formulation [525] . 

Co incorporation strengthened CO 

2 adsorption while promoting 
iron carburization to carbide species, which favored chain propa- 
gation [ 526 , 527 ]. Gnanamani et al . [528] demonstrated that Co-Fe 
(50:50) catalysts showed higher hydrocarbon selectivity (20-25%) 
as compared to monometallic Fe or Co catalysts while methane se- 
lectivity was about 50-60%.

Numpilani  et  al .  [529]  investigated  the  effect  of  calcination

tion temperature increased (above 500 °C) the oleﬁn/paraﬃn ra- 
tio increased while methane production was suppressed as a re- 
sult  of  reducing  the  hydrogenation  strength  of  the  catalyst  via 
KAlO

mation. In addition, higher calcination temperatures increased the 
interaction between iron and other metal oxide species, which in 
turn  reduced  the  hydrogenation  ability  of  the  catalyst.  Xu  et  al . 
[530] demonstrated that different metals could result in different 
products based on their reduction potential. In this regard, Mo

mining the reaction path and in the presence of Cu/(Fe + Cu) = 4/9 
the formate pathway was favorable with respect to the carboxyl

reducibility via providing appropriate sites for hydrogen dissocia- 
tion that can reduce Fe at low temperatures [486] .

Hydrocarbons  can  be  produced  via  methanol-mediated  route, 
where  a  hybrid  catalyst  comprising  methanol-selective  catalyst 
and zeolite is used. Generally, the ﬁrst catalyst is responsible for 
methanol production while the zeolite offers appropriate acid sites 
for methanol conversion to hydrocarbons [ 539 , 540 ].

Liu  et  al .  [541]  suggested  that  -M-O-  (M = Ga,  Zn)  sites 
4 /SAPO-34  were  active  in  providing  atomic  hydrogen 
on  ZnGa 
for  CO 
2  transformation  to  formate  and  subsequently  methoxide 
species, which led to methanol production via further hydrogena- 
tion according to Fig. 48 . The Ga/Zn ratio could affect the amount 
of oxygen vacancies, which was reported to be of paramount sig- 
niﬁcance for CO 

2 activation to methanol [541] . 

Xu et al . [542] proposed that in the presence of Na-Fe-HZSM- 
5, the pore structure of zeolite as a key component was responsi- 
ble for further reactions of light oleﬁns such as isomerization, hy- 
drogenation, cyclization and cracking. However, excessive HZSM-5 
loading could result in the production of more heavy aromatics via 
polycondensation and alkylation reactions. Similar results were re- 
ported by Wei et al . [543] in the presence of physically mixed Na- 
Fe

and 9.1% CO 
sponsible for CO 
2 activation while zeolite Brønsted acid sites were 
beneﬁcial in the aromatization of methanol and oleﬁns to p-xylene. 
As a whole, it can be speculated that HZSM-5 is capable of cy- 
cloaddition  reactions  as  depicted  in  Fig.  53  to  produce  paraﬃns 
and aromatics from FT products [550] .

over  ZnZrO  and  subsequent  oleﬁns  formation  on  SAPO-34  as  il- 
lustrated  in  Fig.  56 .  Wang  et  al .  [554]  showed  that  oleﬁns  pro- 
duction  through  methanol  was  dependent  on  the  Brønsted  acid 
2  oxide  in  both 
sites  of  SAPO-34.  However,  the  sites  on  ZnO-ZrO 
studies were Lewis acids appropriate for CO 
2  conversion. In fact, 
the synergy between these sites resulted in the tuned electronic 
properties of the composite catalyst. The physicochemical proper- 
3 -ZnZrOx/SAPO-34 thus plays an important role in tun- 
ties of In 
ing product distribution [ 292 , 295 ]. Moreover, the small crystal size 
shortens the methanol diffusion path from the catalyst surface to 
the SAPO-34 acid sites. In addition, nitric acid treatment reduces 
Brønsted acid sites and consequently increases the selectivity to-

Moreover, Li et al. [545] proved that dispersing ZnZrO nanopar-

curred in the presence of H-ZSM-5 ( Fig. 50 ). The most advanta-

potential in tuning product selectivity towards oleﬁns or aromatics 
via selecting appropriate metal sites and zeolites [546] .

4.1.3. Promoter role 

Promoters  are  often  incorporated  into  catalysts  to  raise  the 
yield  of  the  desired  hydrocarbons.  Although  iron  catalysts  were 
2  with a much higher aﬃnity to- 
found capable of converting CO 
wards alkenes and long-chain HCs with respect to Co catalysts, un- 
doped iron catalysts showed high selectivity to undesired products. 
Therefore, promoters were employed to tailor and optimize prod- 
uct  distribution  [559–562] .  Promoters  can  alter  either  electronic 
or/and structural catalyst properties. Structural promoters can in-

ﬂuence the formation and stabilization of the active phase, result- 
ing  in  high  catalyst  dispersion  on  the  support  and  subsequently 
lead to higher conversion rates [ 563 , 564 ]. However, electronic pro- 
moters may change electron density close to the catalyst valence 
band,  mutating  local  electron  density  near  the  surface  and  con- 
sequently modifying the active sites. Electronic promoters can in- 
crease  conversion  levels  as  well  as  altering  product  distribution 
[ 565 , 566 ]. 

Generally, binders are not catalytically inactive or chemically in- 
ert, especially at high temperatures. Therefore, binder–catalyst in- 
teractions can strongly inﬂuence the catalyst selectivity and activ- 
ity, which is mainly due to the changes in catalyst acidity [567] . 
However, the promoter played the most signiﬁcant role in perturb- 
ing the active site to enhance CO 
2 conversion, while the remaining 
parameters such as binder, and support could slightly improve the 
product selectivity.

Manganese  (Mn)  has  been  reported  to  act  as  both  structural 
and electronic promoters on  iron-based catalysts.  Suppression of 
methane formation and increasing the alkene/alkane ratio in both 
FT and CO 
2 hydrogenation [ 28 , 488 ] were reported as the results of 
Mn addition to iron-containing catalysts [568] . Mn promoted cat- 
alyst reduction along with dispersion and carburization of precur- 
sor Fe 
3 -state markedly increase the basicity of the catalyst sur- 
face [569] , possibly due to incorporation in iron’s lattice [486] . It 
is worth mentioning that over-doping of iron-based catalysts had 
a  negative  effect  by  blocking  the  active  sites,  which  resulted  in 
the production of unwanted species and reduced the CO conver- 
sion [ 255 , 517 , 569 ]. Liang et al . [570] showed that Mn addition to 
Na/Fe  could  enhance  oleﬁns  production,  since  Mn-Fe  interaction 
could  inhibit  chain  growth  via  reducing  the  strength  of  CO  ad- 
sorption  over  5Mn-Na/Fe  catalyst.  Mn  can  often  be  replaced  by 
copper (Cu) as promoter in iron-based catalysts due to its similar 
performance to Mn and its capability to signiﬁcantly enhance the 
CO 
2  hydrogenation ability. In addition to acting as a RWGS cata- 
lyst [571] , Cu was indicated to increase the reduction of hematite 
particles within the carburization process along with growing the 
dispersion of catalyst particles [572] . In its metallic form, Cu can 
provide active sites for H 
2 dissociative adsorption [486] . Liu et al . 
[573] showed that the addition of Cu promoters led to more alkane 
production via alkene secondary hydrogenation reactions. 

Potassium (K) addition as a promoter had the most effect on 
the performance of the catalyst. The critical role of K, in FT and 
MFT reactions, has not clearly understood yet, and among other 
alkaline promoters K could cause the largest conundrum [ 486 , 574 ]. 
In the FT reaction, K acted as an electronic promoter rather than a 
structural one. K is a donor of an additional electron density for 
the  catalyst  active  sites  that  favor  the π -bond  formation  so  en- 
hance the CO dissociative adsorption and decrease the H 
2 adsorp- 
tion [575–577] , which decreased alkene hydrogenation [ 578 , 579 ]. 
In CO 
2 hydrogenation, larger amounts of K were found to be ben- 
eﬁcial  in  contrast  to  FT  reactions  that  could  be  poisonous  for 
iron-based  catalysts  [ 477 , 517 ].  K  addition  increased  CO 
2  conver- 
sion  while  decreasing  methane  production  [ 580 , 581 ].  Moreover, 
the alkene/alkane ratio increased and longer chain HCs were en- 
hanced [ 517 , 582 ]. The ASF distribution for K-Mn-Fe catalysts in CO 
2 
hydrogenation showed a high chain growth probability that was 
only slightly lower than that in FT reactions [ 462 , 517 , 583 ]. Guo et

According  to  Fig.  58 ,  unsupported  Fe

aromatization could occur over ZSM-5. At First, CO produced via 
RWGS reaction over Fe

action occurred in the presence of Fe nanoparticles to form hydro- 
carbons. The remaining part of CO diffused to the ZSM-5 and MOR 
pores and hydrogenated to SMS. Ethylene was the main product 
of SMS transformation. ( Fig. 58 b). The pathway of oleﬁns forma- 
tion via carbonylated intermediates of surface has been shown to 
be via forming the ketone-based intermediates in both MFT and 
methanol-mediated routes. In the last step, the produced oleﬁns 
took part in aromatization reactions as depicted in Fig. 58 c.

Moreover, the introduction of K to Fe-M/TiO

lysts reduced CH

tivity. However, further K addition (K/Fe > 0.3) led to higher CO 
production and reduced hydrocarbon selectivity. In addition, La in-

due to lower carbide content [588] .

Ceria (Ce) is a well-known WGS catalyst and also considered as 
an ideal promoter for iron-based catalysts. It has been indicated 
that  Ce-promoted  Fe  catalysts  showed  less  chain  growth  ability 
than unpromoted iron catalysts but resulted in a larger percentage 
of CO [ 589 , 590 ]. Considering the reaction mechanism and based on 
the product composition Ce deactivated the catalyst via blocking 
its active sites. To test this assumption, supported catalysts were 
examined  by  the  research  group  of  Pérez-Alonso  with  better  Ce

Ce deposition on the particles’ surface blocked the catalyst’s active

tions. Both zirconia and lattice oxygens compete in accepting elec- 
trons from iron ions, which increased the positive charge of iron

and consequently enhanced CO

Low space velocity (SV), high residence time, led to increased

SV = 10 0 0.  SV  was  considered  as  the  main  tool  to  increase  con- 
version [600] . Willauer et al. [601] reported that both CO and CO 
2 
conversion  could  be  increased  via  lowering  GHSV,  while  not  in- 
ﬂuencing the chain growth probability. However, a very low GHSV 
was considered to be impractical since high amounts of catalyst 
are required to achieve the desired conversion [601] . Visconti et al .

reactions in the presence of potassium [602] .

In this section the effect of operating conditions is inspected 
based on the previous experimental studies that are demonstrated 
in Table 3 . The effect of operating conditions has been studied in 
terms of space velocity, temperature, and pressure in the following 
sections. 

4.2.2. Pressure effect 

Besides  reducing  SV,  elevated  pressure  led  to  a  shift  of  the 
product  distribution  considerably  towards  long-chain  HCs  [603] . 
Since the RWGS reaction is reversible, elevation of pressure doesn’t

action is consumed subsequently through the FT reaction and thus 
taken out of equilibrium. However, H 
2 O would be produced that 
inevitably obstructs the RWGS reaction and hence the CO produc- 
2 conversion, especially at improved 
tion. Meanwhile, the high CO 
HCs yield, at high pressure, may lead to signiﬁcantly high H 
2 O par- 
tial  pressure  in  the  catalyst  bed  [604] .  Thus,  it  is  crucial  to  re- 
move H 
2 O in order to avoid shifting the equilibrium towards the 
WGS reaction as well as hindering catalyst deactivation [605] . Pres- 
sure increase (1 to 15 bar) resulted in higher CO 
2 conversion and 
lower selectivity towards CO and hydrocarbons along with higher 
selectivity towards CH 
4  [606] . Modeling studies showed that hy- 
drocarbon  selectivity  was  not  affected  by  pressure  rise  however, 
the amount of light oleﬁns increased at extremely high pressures. 
In addition, the yields of heavier hydrocarbons (C 
10 ) 
decreased considerably when the pressure reached 10 MPa [607] . 
According to the results of Visconti et al . [602] C 
4 oleﬁns were 
the dominant products at 5-10 barg (0.5-1 MPa) in the presence 
3 cat- 
of bulk Fe-catalyst promoted by K. However, over Co-Pt/Al 
alysts pressure reduction (450 to 150 psi) led to enhanced light 
oleﬁns production and lower CH 

4 production [473] .

4.2.3. Temperature effect 

CO 

2  conversion  and  CO  yield  increase  slowly  with  tempera- 
ture increase through the RWGS reaction (reversible endothermic). 
In  contrast,  the  exothermic  FT  reaction  proceeds  faster  at  high- 
temperature conditions. Thus, ﬁnding a system to avoid this ther- 
mal conﬂict between these reactions occurring simultaneously in a 
reactor appears to be critical [608] . Moreover, the dependence of 
HCs yield on temperature is not unequivocal due to a larger ten- 
dency of catalyst deactivation as a result of inert carbon deposi- 
tion. Temperature plays an important role in shifting equilibrium 
and reaction rates [609] . In addition, at temperatures above 325 °C, 
hydrocarbon yields were almost independent of pressure and SV 
while at lower temperatures (about 300 °C) SV reduction and pres- 
sure rise had positive effects on the total hydrocarbon yield [607] . 
However, the C-C chain cracking is serious at high temperatures, 
proceeding to the Sabatier reaction. The improvement of carbur- 
ization can lead to a higher oleﬁn/paraﬃn ratio at higher tempera- 
tures due to the improved H-elimination in the C-C chain termina- 
tion on a carbon-rich surface. This leads to the occurrence of the 
Boudouard reaction (R18) [ 610 , 611 ], which necessitates the adjust-

Above  240  °C  the  curvature  of  the  Arrhenius  plot  changed,

to obtain high selectivity towards C

bons [612] . Owen et al . [613] demonstrated that low temperatures 
(about 230 °C) favored CH

ature to approximately 330 °C resulted in the production of long-

4.3. Effect of reactor conﬁguration 

As mentioned before, endothermic RWGS and exothermic FT re- 
actions can be favorably integrated in a single reactor to enhance 
energy  eﬃciency.  Fixed-bed  reactors  have  been  used  extensively 
to produce hydrocarbons from CO 
2 hydrogenation [ 586 , 603 ]. How- 
ever, considering the potential limitations of the ﬁxed-bed reactor 
such as temperature control and hot spots, slurry and ﬂuidized- 
bed reactors have been exploited to enhance the performance of

2 hydrogenation to HCs since they showed beneﬁcial results for 
CO 
removing the generated heat of this highly exothermic process as 
shown in Fig. 62 [489] . 

In  fact,  CO 

2  hydrogenation  to  HCs  in  slurry  and  ﬂuidized- 
bed  reactors  over  Fe–Cu–K–Al  catalyst  resulted  in  superior  cat- 
alytic  performance  in  comparison  with  a  ﬁxed-bed  reactor.  The 
space  time  yields  were  reported  to  be  41.8,  35.2  and  31.8  for 
ﬂuidized-bed,  slurry  and  ﬁxed-bed  reactors,  respectively  [489] . 
Moreover, heavy HCs and light oleﬁns can be produced in slurry 
and ﬂuidized-bed reactors  as  illustrated  in  Fig.  63  [489,614,615] . 
Products  of  high  boiling  points  and  saturated  hydrocarbons  are 
usually  produced  in  slurry  reactors  while,  ﬂuidized-bed  reactors 
are  better  for  production  of  unsaturated  hydrocarbons.  For  in- 
stance, oleﬁn selectivity at 300 °C, was ∼86.7% which was higher 
than those of ﬁxed-bed (75.9%) and slurry (72.9%) reactors. In ad- 
dition the selectivity towards heavy hydrocarbons ( ≥ C 
5 ) were in 
the  order  of  slurry  (72.9%)  >  ﬂuidized-bed  (55.6%)  >  ﬁxed-bed 
(53.9%) [489] . Coupling reactors into a series has been proposed as 
2  conversion and selectivity towards 
a means to increase both CO 
heavy hydrocarbons ( > C 
5 ). Lee et al . [567] demonstrated that us- 
2  conversion  to  68.5%  from 
ing  a  series  of  reactors  increased  CO

40.8% in a single reactor at the same operating conditions. How- 
ever, high pressure drop hindered the application of this conﬁgura- 
tion and recycle reactors were proposed. Recycle reactor (R = 3 and 
6 with GHSV of 40 0 0 ml/g cat . hr) resulted in higher CO 
2  conver- 
sion (62.3% and 75.6%), lower oleﬁn selectivity (82.8% and 78.1%) 
and higher selectivity towards C 
5 + (74.5% and 71.3%) compared to 
those for the single reactor. However, when R = 5 at GHSV of 20 0 0 
5 + selectivity (68.3%) decreased, while selectivity to- 
ml/g cat . hr, C 
wards CH 
4 (12.1%) and light paraﬃns (6.8%) increased. Meanwhile, 
CO 
2 conversion increased to 88.2% compared to the other recycle 
reactors. It can be concluded that, recycling, provides more resi- 
dence time for hydrogenation, which led to further hydrogenation 
and oligomerization of produced oleﬁns. 

Nevertheless, the issues regarding water formation could not be 
solved via these reactors. The water produced during the FT reac- 
tion is also perceived to obstruct the RWGS reaction by decreas- 
2 conversion. In addition, water can oxidize the catalyst ac- 
ing CO 
tive sites and shortens the Fe-based catalyst lifetime, which has an 
additional negative effect on the RWGS reaction rate. Hence, the 
achievement of a selective and continuous water removal method 
can  be  a  promising  approach  for  decelerating  catalyst  deactiva- 
tion [616–618] . Water removal can shift the RWGS equilibrium to- 
wards more CO production, which enhances CO 
2  conversion and 
HCs yield [619] . For instance, Bordet et al . [620] demonstrated that 
in-situ water adsorption by molecular sieves accelerated CO 
2 con- 
version  via  shifting  equilibrium  RWGS  reaction  while  inhibiting 
catalyst oxidation. It was observed that, after 7 h CO 
2 conversion 
increased from 69 to 79% with using molecular sieves, while selec- 
tivity towards CO decreased from 21 to 14%, which showed higher 
conversion of CO to hydrocarbons in the presence of adsorbents 
[620] . In addition, Bradley et al . [621] showed that in ﬁxed-bed, 
catalyst pretreatment with mineral oil as a start-up solvent could 
increase hydrocarbon yield by 25% while reducing catalyst oxida- 
tion via diminishing water adsorption. 

However,  Guo  et  al.  [526]  proposed  a  two-stage  reactor  with 
2  conversion increased while selectivity 
ex-situ water removal. CO 
towards  CO  decreased.  In  addition,  this  conﬁguration  led  to  the 
further  conversion  of  CO  via  FT  reaction  and  hydrocarbon  yield 
increased about 3 times. By employing an ice-trap between two 
stages  the  CO 
2  conversion  increased  from  24.6  to  65.1%,  while 
the CO selectivity decreased from 15.1% to 3.3%. This resulted in 

45 

the formation of 227.4 g 
Fuel /kg cat .h liquid fuel which is remarkably 
higher than that achieved without ex-situ water removal (70.2%) 
[526] . 

Moreover, theoretical investigation on the effect of reactor con- 
ﬁguration was also performed via modeling ﬁxed-bed reactors in 
our previous studies. Accordingly, different conﬁgurations of sin- 
gle ﬁxed-bed reactors are presented in Fig. 64 (a-c). As mentioned 
earlier, CO 
2  hydrogenation to methane and hydrocarbons was in- 
vestigated via modeling a cylindrical ﬁxed-bed reactor ( Fig. 64 (a)) 
and  kinetic  parameters  were  calculated  via  optimization  [97] .  In 
addition, a sensitivity analysis was accomplished in an annular re- 
actor to ﬁnd the effect of main inﬂuential factors [607] . Moreover, 
the  effect  of  water  removal  through  annular  membrane  reactors 
( Fig. 64 (b)) was analyzed in another study [622] . Membrane re- 
actors (MR) have been considered as a promising conﬁguration in 
CO 
2 hydrogenation to HCs [ 617 , 623 ]. Water can permeate through 
the  membrane  layer  due  to  the  water  partial  pressure  gradient. 
An inert gas such as N 
2 is introduced to the inner tube side and 
sweeps the penetrated water [622] . Hydroxy sodalite (H-SOD) is a 
zeolite-like water-permeable material, which can be used as mem- 
brane for water removal [ 605 , 624 ]. It was concluded that MR, lead 
to increased transformation of CO to hydrocarbons, with the prod- 
uct distribution changed and selectivity towards light hydrocarbons 
(e.g., C 
3 hydrocar- 
bons increased to ∼ 15% when pressure ratio and sweep ratio were 
2 and 3 respectively. In addition, as the extent of water removal 
increased via increasing pressure or sweep ratios, the amount of 
C 
3  hydrocar- 
bons, which was attributed to the lack of H 
2 due to its increased 
2 O [622] . This issue was circumvented using a MR 
conversion to H 
2 in the outer shell, and to water in the inner shell 
permeable to H 
( Fig. 64 (c)) to adjust the H 
2 concentration and thus tune the hy- 
drocarbons distribution [625] . In order to adjust hydrogen feeding, 
a H 
2  perm-selective membrane was proposed for employment in 
the MRs [ 626 , 627 ]. Polymeric membranes commonly can be used 
between 100 and 300 °C, while inorganic membranes can be em- 
ployed at higher temperatures up to 800 °C. Ceramic membranes 
can operate at even elevated temperatures of over 10 0 0 °C [628] . 
Owing to inﬁnite hydrogen perm-selectivity and high thermal sta- 
bility, palladium-based membranes have been used extensively for 
H 

2  hydrocarbons increased, exceeding production of C

2 permeation [628–630] .

5. Discussion and perspectives 

As  described  in  this  review,  the  hydrogenation  of  CO 

2  was  a 
powerful  and  feasible  process  for  CO 
2  utilization.  However,  CO 
2 
is  chemically  stable  and  thermodynamically  unfavorable,  which 
indicates  some  limitations  on  its  conversion  and  utilization.  Al- 
most  all  previous  studies  aiming  to  inspect  factors  affecting  the 
2  hydrogena- 
fuel  and  chemical  production  eﬃciency  through  CO 
tion that were performed experimentally. High reaction heat, multi 
reaction systems and sensitive catalysts make CO 
2  hydrogenation 
to value-added products (methane, methanol and hydrocarbons) a 
challenging process with a long history of process research and de- 
velopment. Therefore, various technical methods and speciﬁc ap- 
proaches on catalyst type, operating conditions and rational reac- 
tor design, have been accomplished to eliminate these limitations. 
All extracted data in this review ( Tables 1 , 2 and 3 ) have been vi-

It can be observed in Fig. 65 , the methane yields of the most

need for more process optimization in this area.

For  methanol  production,  catalysts  containing  Cu  and  Zn 
showed  signiﬁcant  roles  in  enhancing  the  methanol  yield. 
Currently,  the  CAMERE  process  [634] ,  which  is  a  two  step 
methanol  production,  including  RWGS  over  ZnAl 
4  followed 
2 O  removal  and  methanol  synthesis  in  the  presence  of 
by  H 
Cu/ZnO/ZrO

89%.  According  to  Fig.  66,  the  methanol  yields  are  almost  un-

of 50.9% while exhibiting a space-time yield of 7729 g

2  conversion  led  to  low  methanol  yields.  In  addi- 
their  low  CO 
tion,  the  lowest  yields  ( <  1%)  belong  to  In

and  Cu(m)/ZnO  (m = 1,  5,  8,  15),  among  which  Cu  (8)/ZnO  and

in MOF matrix could enhance the catalyst performance in terms 
of both stability and selectivity towards hydrocarbons as reported 
by  Liu  et  al .  [635] .  In  conclusion,  much  research  is  yet  required 
to  improve  the  performance  of  these  catalysts  in  terms  of  both 
CO 
2 conversion and HCs selectivity since this process is still in its 
infancy.

However, while previous results highlighted that both catalyst 
properties and reactor design play important roles in the hydro- 
genation  of  CO 
3 OH  and  specially  HCs,  this  review 
identiﬁed the crucial role of reactor conﬁguration. Therefore, a new 
reactor  conﬁguration  consisting  of  perm-selective  walls  to  water 
(RWGS ﬁxed-bed reactor) and hydrogen (ﬂuidized-bed FT reaction) 
is  proposed  to  take  the  advantages  of  controlled  removal/dosing 
potentials of the membrane with excellent gas-solid contact and 
heat transfer capabilities of a ﬂuidized-bed in one conﬁguration. 
Moreover, the proposed reactor type usually posses high selectivity 
and activity, and long catalyst activity for the CO 

2 hydrogenation. 

The  aim of  the  proposed reactor  conﬁguration including H 

2 O 
2  perm-selective membranes for the ﬁrst and second reac- 
4 hy- 

and H 
tors, respectively, is to achieve higher CO 
drocarbons. 

2 conversion to C 

2 -C 

Fe-based  catalysts  have  gained  much  attention  due  to  their 
promising application along with a low price [636] . CO 
2 is reduced 
by iron (II) continued by H radical secession via adsorbed species 
on the catalyst surface ( Fig. 68 ). The reaction of residual H with 
carbonyl C results in the formation of OH, formic acid and CO. Fe- 
CH 
2 radical forms similarly as a carbon-carbon propagation prod- 
uct. Chain propagation displays the principal reaction route, since 
higher hydrocarbons are determined as major products. Higher se- 
lectivity of α-oleﬁns with respect to that of paraﬃns is ascribed 
2  in this reaction, which 
to less H 
represents the importance of hydrogen dosing during the reaction 
[96]. 

2  uptake along with no extra H 

Moreover,  quite  a  few  studies  have  considered  the  effects  of 
the reactor type. Even the best catalyst considering the best sup- 
port and promoter in the optimized operating conditions could not 
lead to high hydrocarbon yields due to catalyst deactivation, be- 
cause water is produced and hot spots occur in the single reactor. 
Besides, much effort was accomplished to identify the most eﬃ- 
cient reactor for this process by comparing experimental data of 
different reactor types. The most inﬂuential effect on CO 
2 conver- 
sion was the reactor conﬁguration, while the catalyst type and the 
operating conditions effects were most important on product se- 
lectivity. 

The spherical reactor is a rational reactor design to boost the 
wall surface area of the reactor in order to increase water perme- 
ation during the reaction [637] . As a whole, the single ﬁxed-bed 
reactor can be designed in either annular or spherical conﬁgura- 
tion, and may be permeable to water or hydrogen for water re- 
moval or hydrogen stoichiometry adjustment purposes. Moreover, 
a spherical reactor can be proposed as an attractive alternative de- 
sign  in  comparison  with  cylindrical  reactors  owing  to  its  lower 
pressure drop (which is related to the different cross-sectional area 
in spherical reactor compared to the cross-sectional area of cylin- 
drical reactor) and recompression costs as well as construction ma- 
terial investment (reduced wall thickness to half) [638–640] . 

Another alternative to enhance the eﬃciency of a single ﬁxed- 
bed  reactor  is  using  a  ﬂuidized-bed  reactor.  Due  to  the  supe- 
rior  heat  management  ability  and  appropriate  temperature  con- 
trol, ﬂuidized-bed reactors are particularly attractive for carrying 
out  highly  exothermic  reactions.  Moreover,  they  exhibit  proper 
mixing  along  with  a  small  pressure  drop  while  eliminating  dif- 
fusion  limitations  [641] .  Other  beneﬁts  of  ﬂuidized-bed  reactors 
include  the  possibility  of  using  inexpensive  metal  alloys  and 
periodic/continuous  catalyst  regeneration  and  replacement  [642] . 

Saeidi  et  al .  [31]  proposed  that  both  methanol  and  FT  reactions 
could be improved through superseding a ﬁxed-bed by a ﬂuidized- 
bed reactor. The proposed membrane reactor can be incorporated 
into both ﬁxed-bed and ﬂuidized-bed reactors to combine the ad- 
vantages of controlled dosing and removal potentials of the mem- 
brane with excellent heat transfer and gas-solid contact capabil- 
ities  of  ﬂuidized-bed  reactors.  All  speciﬁcations  of  the  ﬂuidized- 
bed dual-type membrane reactor for hydrocarbon synthesis are the 
same as those of a ﬁxed-bed single-stage reactor except the reactor 
length. 

5.1. Dual-type reactor (two-stage reactor) 

The achievement of a high yield indicates that the reactor con- 
ﬁguration is chosen appropriately to align with the characteristics 
of the reaction steps. Key assets for this are to overcome the lim- 
itation of the thermodynamic equilibrium, enhancing the kinetics 
as well as controlling the stoichiometric feed. This can be achieved 
by dual-type membrane reactors. 

2 /CO 

2 + H 

As  mentioned  above,  there  has  been  no  theoretical  study  on 
this  issue;  moreover,  none  of  the  previous  research  has  inves- 
tigated  the  effects  of  reactor  conﬁguration  on  HC  yields.  There- 
fore, researchers focused on investigating this process theoretically, 
which led to the introduction of dual-type membrane reactors us- 
ing a H 
2 O perm-selective membrane in ﬁrst for the ﬁxed-bed and 
then for ﬂuidized-bed reactor conﬁguration. Such a combination of 
reactor effects is able to eradicate catalyst deactivation associated 
with other types of reactors, while eliminating the produced water 
and simultaneously adjusting the dosing of hydrogen concentration 
to prevent reaction distortion caused by temperature ﬂuctuations 
in the second reactor. Moreover, dual-type membrane reactors al- 
ready have been proven as the best conﬁguration in the methanol 
synthesis process in terms of product eﬃciency. Since the reaction 
mechanism for H 
2  to hydrocarbons was almost the same as 
that of methanol, this conﬁguration may probably be applicable for 
CO 

2 conversion to HCs as well. 
The outer tubes of both reactors are ﬁlled with catalysts. After 
passing through a heat exchanger, the main feed stream (CO 
2 ) 
is introduced in the inner tube of the second reactor (where there 
is no catalyst) from upside and is preheated by the heat released 
from the exothermic FT. After leaving this reactor, the preheated 
reactant feed is directed to the top of the outer tube and is fed 
to the second reactor. To control the reaction stoichiometry in the 
ﬁrst reactor and to adjust hydrogen feeding to the second reactor, 
the wall of the inner tube of the second reactor is conﬁgured to be 
hydrogen perm-selective. Moreover, the presence of a tubular wa- 
ter perm-selective membrane inserted in the wall of the ﬁrst re- 
actor can strongly shift the RWGS reaction equilibrium to the right 
side for the production of more CO. In this stage, feed (H 
2 ) is 
converted to CO via the endothermic RWGS reaction and the reac- 
tion heat is supplied by the furnace of the ﬁrst reactor. The outlet 
gas from the ﬁrst reactor leaves the reactor and enters the outer 
tube of the second reactor, with the reactant feed (H 
2 ) ﬂow- 
ing from top to down inside the inner tube. The chemical reaction 
occurs on the catalyst surface, while the main feed stream removes 
the  generated  heat  of  the  FT  reaction.  In  this  way,  the  catalysts 
are prevented from exposure to extreme temperatures and catalyst 
deactivation via sintering and hot spot formation can be circum- 
vented. Finally, by passing through a heat exchanger, the product 
temperature is decreased while that of the reactant is increased. 
In  general,  the  two-stage  catalyst  bed  system  can  operate  with 
higher conversion and longer catalyst lifetime. Fig. 69 (a-g) depict 
the complete conﬁguration and elemental volume of dual-type re- 
actors in detail.

It should be emphasized that combining both hydrogen and wa-

gen shortage, which is permeated in the form of water. The gen- 
eral advantages of the proposed dual-type membrane reactors are 
as follows: 

face area to the reactor volume compared to that of a cylindri- 
cal reactor, which results in higher water and hydrogen perme- 
ation. 

1- The feasibility of heat integration: considering two reactors in- 
stead of a single reactor due to the two different kinds of re- 
action with regard to the reaction mechanism, allows using the 
heat of the exothermic reaction to preheat the feed of the en- 
dothermic reactor. 

2- Reduced  byproduct  formation:  using  a  H 

2 O  perm-selective 
membrane in the ﬁrst reactor (RWGS), fast deactivation of cat- 
alyst due to the formation of carbon deposition is prevented. 
In addition, the equilibrium shifts towards more CO production, 
which is the feed of the second reactor (FT). 

3- Increased  reaction  rates:  hydrogen  dosing  along  the  reactor 
2 perm-selective, 

length can be controlled as second reactor is H 
which prevents the Boudouard reaction (R18) . 

4- Increased  surface  area  of  permeation:  employing  a  spherical 
membrane reactor results in increased ratio of the lateral sur- 

5.2. Corrugated and CANS reactors 

Finally yet importantly, there are arguments for forthcoming in- 
vestigation to put an emphasis on a rational reactor design to shift 
the reaction toward the product side while maintaining the cat- 
alyst  activity  during  the  reaction.  This  may  be  accomplished  via 
increasing the surface area of the membrane reactor wall using a 
corrugated membrane concept to increase the surface area ( Fig. 70 
(a) to enhance both heat and mass transfer capabilities. This novel 
2 hydrogenation to value-added prod- 
reactor conﬁguration for CO 
ucts is based on theoretical insight via surface science approaches 
in  line  with  reaction  mechanisms  ( Fig.  68 ),  which  might  bridge 
the gap between the macroscopic characteristics of practical cat- 
alysts and potential drawbacks of the ﬁxed-bed reactor in order to 
overcome low value-added products eﬃciency. Corrugated or con-

voluted membranes have been used in hydrogen processing sys- 
tems as developed conﬁgurations [6 43–6 47] . Fig. 70 (a) presents a 
proposed conﬁguration of permeable dual-type reactors for which 
the inner tubes of both reactors are corrugated to increase the per- 
meation area. The ﬁrst conﬁguration includes two ﬁxed-bed cor- 
rugated  membrane reactors,  which are both permeable to water 
and  hydrogen  in  the  inner  and  outer  tubes,  respectively  to  cir- 
cumvent equilibrium while compromising the hydrogen loss. Re- 
cently, British Petroleum (BP) and Johnson Matthey have demon- 
strated the crucial role of co-developing both reactor conﬁguration 
(to enhance productivity) and catalyst (to enhance selectivity) for 
FT synthesis. A novel catalyst carrier reactor for FT technology enti- 
tled “CANS” Fig. 70 (b) was designed which exhibits higher produc- 
tivity, superior heat transfer, reduced pressure drop offering ma- 
jor  economic  savings  over  conventional  ﬁxed-bed  reactors  [676] . 
According to this conﬁguration, syngas enters the central channel 
(A)  from  the  top  catalyst  carrier,  and  ﬂows  through  the  catalyst 
bed radially where FT reaction takes place (B). The hot gases leave 
through a porous outer wall and ﬂow towards the top of the inner- 
side of catalyst carrier (C). As the gases ﬂow down between the 
catalyst carrier and inner tube wall, heat is removed by water in 
the cooling jacket (D). The gases then pass through the next cat- 
alyst carrier below and the process repeats (E). The design of this 
CANS reactor should also offer advantages for CO 
2 hydrogenation 
to light oleﬁns. 

6. Conclusions 

As the main greenhouse gas, CO 

2  increase in the atmosphere 
is  mostly  considered  to  be  responsible  for  climate  change  and 
2 transformation to fuels and chemicals would 
global warming, CO 
be helpful to circulate carbon in order to diminish the greenhouse 
effect. Methane, methanol and HCs can be exploited as fuel substi- 
tutes, emerging energy storage media and raw materials of petro- 
chemical  products.  Thus,  CO 
2  hydrogenation  can  eﬃciently  de- 
2 accumulation and diminish the greenhouse gas ef- 
crease the CO 
fect, while producing valuable chemicals and fuels. Currently, many 
investigations have been performed in this regard, but many issues 
to  concerning  commercialization  of  CO 
2  hydrogenation  to  value- 
added products have not been solved yet. 

I There  are  still  numerous  opportunities  to  improve  the  per- 
formance and stability (thermal, and water-tolerance) of cata- 
lysts. In methanation process, Ni-based catalysts are commonly 
employed (even commercially) due to their high performance 
in  terms  of  both  conversion  and  selectivity  along  with  low 
price. In addition, hybrid catalytic-plasma reactors have gained 
much  attention  for  methanation  reaction  to  reduce  the  reac- 
tion  temperature.  However,  much  research  is  yet  required  to 
enhance  the  thermal  durability  of  methanation  catalysts.  For 
methanol synthesis from CO 
2 hydrogenation, Cu-based catalysts 
have been predominantly used due to their high methanol for- 
mation rate, which might be decreased considerably if selectiv- 
ity towards methanol increased above 80%. However, low sta- 
bility of Cu particles due to oxidation is one of the challeng- 
ing issues in methanol synthesis, which was reported to be di- 
minished via active-site encapsulation. In addition, agglomera- 
tion of other catalyst components (such as ZnO) in the pres- 
ence of Cu, is another issue that necessitates further investiga- 
tion to improve the performance of these catalysts [648] . For 
hydrocarbon production via CO 
2  hydrogenation, Fe-based cat- 
alysts (specially oxides) including K as promoter showed bet- 
ter performance although still far from being commercialized. 
In addition, support plays an important role in oleﬁn selectivity 
specially in methanol-mediated pathway. 

II A comprehensive insight about active species and their inter- 
actions, along with interaction among active centers with pro- 
moter  and  support  are  of  paramount  signiﬁcance  for  catalyst 
design and tailoring. Accordingly, in - situ characterization tech- 
niques (XRD, TEM, and X-ray absorption) should be employed 
to distinguish active sites, while analytical methods such as XPS 
and DFT calculations are required to identify the main surface 
2  hy- 
species to explain the elusive reaction mechanism of CO 
drogenation to value-added products. Besides, in-situ structural 
and surface studies under working conditions can be performed 
to validate the proposed mechanism. 

III In addition to catalytic studies, thermodynamic aspects of CO 
2 
hydrogenation should be considered as well to prevail the equi- 
librium limitation on product yield. Primarily, optimization of 
reaction conditions should be taken into consideration. More- 
over, the design and optimization of CO 
2  hydrogenation reac- 
tors should be analyzed comprehensively. Therefore, novel re- 
actors like perm-selective membrane reactors have been pre- 
sented, to remove water and in turn shift the thermodynamic 
equilibrium towards the desired product. 

The outcomes of this review can create incentives for further 
research about exploiting multicomponent catalysts and multifunc- 
tional reactors to circumvent the challenging issues of CO 
2 hydro- 
genation to value-added products.
