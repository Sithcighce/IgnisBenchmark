Is full recyclability of polyolefins via chemical recycling a dream, or can it become a reality? The main problem
in recycling plastic waste is that its composition is highly heterogeneous while sorting and purifying solutions to
obtain  mono-streams  are  complex  and  require  large  investments,  thereby  hampering  the  economy  of  scale.
Ideally, novel chemical recycling processes are designed to have mixed plastic wastes as input and higher value
products are produced such as C2–C4 olefins or aromatics instead of a low value oil. In this review we show the
directions how we can realize these objectives. Classical thermal pyrolysis offers some possibilities but requires
very  high  temperatures  exceeding  800
C  to  transform  the  plastic  waste  back  into  the  desired  temperatures.
Nevertheless, because of its robustness, thermal pyrolysis of polyolefinic plastic waste is currently intensively
studied and the first industrial applications are operated at low to medium temperature range to maximize oil as
the main product. Catalytic pyrolysis is still under development, but under ideal lab-scale conditions around 85
wt.% of C2–C4  olefins can be produced when pure polyolefin feeds are used. With improved catalyst design it
should  be possible to  get this number  further up without  affecting the catalyst stability. As the yield of  light
olefins in pyrolysis is impacted by both the process design (reactor type, the efficiency of plastic sorting prior to
conversion,  flexibility  towards  feed  composition)  and  experimental  parameters  (temperature,  catalyst  type,
catalyst/feed ratio, contact mode, residence time, addition of inert or reactants) also further improvements are
possible in this respect. To industrialize pyrolysis of plastic waste, short residence times (<1 s) are crucial to
avoid  secondary  reactions  and  by-products  such  as  methane,  coke,  and  aromatics.  Pyrolysis reactors  that  are
designed according to these principles, such as downers, spouted fluidized bed, and vortex reactors, are envis-
aged to result in optimal yields of C2–C4 olefins. However, coke formation seems to be inevitable and the reactor
designs need to be sufficiently robust to allow for in-situ coke removal. For future research it will be crucial for
the industrial viability of plastic waste pyrolysis to improve the purification of the plastic waste stream, optimize
both the catalysts selectivity and stability, and design a suitable industrial reactor. It is envisaged that further
innovations in these three areas will eventually allow reaching the 90 wt.% target.

1. Overview

The discovery of Ziegler-Natta catalysts for producing polyolefins in
1954 was followed by rapid industrialization. During the last decades,
the  rapidly  increasing  demand  for  plastics  led  to  the  large-scale  pro-
duction  of  polyolefins  (Fig.  1).  Currently,  approximately  350  Mt/y
thermoplastics are produced worldwide, and it is expected that this will
increase to over 580 Mt/y by 2050, mostly due to an increased use of

polyolefins and polystyrene [1]. Despite the rise in the re-use of plastic
products, the share of those polymers in plastic disposal is expected to
increase  significantly.  Fig.  2  shows  the  distribution  of  waste  plastics
worldwide. The results show that polyolefins (LDPE, LLDPE, HDPE, and
PP)  together  with  polystyrene  account  for  about  60  wt.%  of  plastic
waste.  Moreover,  the  regular  and  nonpolar  structure  of  consecutive
–C–C bonds in polyolefins makes them highly resistant to decomposi-
tion, for example, in acidic and alkaline environments or by the influ-
ence  of  UV  light  [2].  Their  regular  hydrocarbon  structure  is  mostly

‘unknown’  to microorganisms, further hampering their environmental
degradation [3]. Consequently, littered and landfilled polyolefins will
remain in the environment for several decades [4], making industrial
collection and efficient recycling essential [5].

Fig. 3 shows an overview of polyolefins from production to appli-
cation  and  types  of  disposal.  The  different  types  of  commercial  poly-
olefins  include  polyethylene  and  polypropylene.  Polyethylenes  are
categorized as high density polyethylene (HDPE; ethylene: 95–99 wt.%,

environmental stability follows the order HDPE > LLDPE > LDPE [22].
During extrusion of polyolefins, the thermal conduction and viscous
shear stress applied to the polymer chains lead to chain scission, chain
branching, and crosslinking [23,24]. The main degradation mechanism
during mechanical recycling of polyolefins assumes radical formation by
hydrogen  abstraction  reactions  induced  by  molecular  oxygen  and
peroxide radicals [25]. The radical sites can alternatively react through
β-scissions  with  the  formation  of  double  bonds  or  recombine  with
peroxide radicals. To reduce radical reactions during mechanical recy-
cling,  stabilizers  such  as  anti-oxidants  are  often  added  to  the  plastic
waste  stream.  Those  anti-oxidants  either  act  as  radical  scavengers  by
reacting  with  oxygen  to  form  stable  peroxide  radicals  (primary),  or
decompose  hydroperoxide  accelerants  into  alcohols  (secondary)  [26].
Anti-oxidants  and  other  thermal  and  UV  stabilizers  are  added  to  the
plastic  waste  stream  to  prevent  radical  reactions  during  mechanical
recycling.  However,  it  should  be  considered  that  those  additives  also
(negatively) affect the chemical recycling of plastic waste and resulting
light olefin yields [27].

The conventional approaches to processing polyolefin waste include
landfilling [28], incineration [29], and mechanical recycling [30,31]. At
present, in the absence of sustainable solutions for plastic waste, landfill
and incineration are still necessary. Furthermore, mechanical recycling
of  polyolefinic  waste  has  limitations  due  to  the  cost  and  difficulty  of
proper plastic sorting, large differences in different grades, presence of
different  additives  and  fillers,  as  well  as  the  occurrence  of  thermo-
mechanical  degradation  during  re-extrusion.  Currently,  mechanical
recycling is highly feasible for some clean HDPE and PET streams [32,
33],  in  particular  because  it  has  typically  the  lowest  environmental
footprint. However, because of the presence of contaminants and ther-
momechanical degradation, it is not always a suitable option for poly-
olefins recycling.

It  would  therefore  be  highly  interesting  to  be  able  to  ‘recover’
monomers from a polyolefin waste stream to use for the production of
high-quality  virgin-like  plastics.  Such  processes,  wherein  polymer
chains are broken up at the molecular level, are commonly referred to as
chemical recycling of plastics. Chemical recycling of polyolefins is still in
its infancy. However, due to the great experience in the conversion and
upgrading of fossil  feeds in past decades,  a number of industrial  pro-
cesses are envisaged to be suitable to convert a polyolefin waste stream
to light olefins. An overview of processes for producing light olefins from

1-olefine: 1–5 wt.%), low density polyethylene (LDPE; ethylene: 100 wt.
%), and linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE; ethylene 88–92 wt.%,

homo-polypropylene
and
co-polypropylene (co-PP; propylene: 95–98 wt.%, ethylene: 2–5 wt.%)
[10,11]. The most widely used commercial grades of polyolefins include
film,  pipe,  blow  molding,  injection  molding,  roto-molding,  profile,
sheet, and fibers [12–14]. Polyolefin grades differ in density, melt flow
index  (MFI),  melt  flow  ratio  (MFR),  and  additives  [15–17].  As
mentioned in Fig. 3, another major difference between these grades is
their shelf lives [18]. For example, most polyolefin films are disposable
and  therefore  account  for  a  remarkable  share  of  plastic  waste.  While
irrigation, HDPE pipes, according to the related standards, must be us-
able for at least 5 years [19,20].

Physical or chemical degradation during the lifetime of the polymers
due to environmental or human influences can result in changes to the
polymer  microstructure.  Examples  are  the  presence  of  light,  heat,
moisture,  or  biological  activity.  The  degradation  of  polymers  is  often
classified  into  three  types  based  on  the  degradation  mechanism:  (1)
photo-degradation, (2) thermo-oxidative degradation, and (3) biodeg-
radation [21]. Those mechanisms can lead to crosslinking of polymer
chains, chain scission, and the introduction of peroxide groups in the
polymers  [21].  Because  of  the  difference  in  the  presence  of  tertiary
carbon atoms in different polyethylene grades, the thermal, photo, and

different feedstocks is given in Fig. 4. Current olefin production mainly
relies on the steam cracking of fossil feedstocks such as crude oil and
natural gas. Many of the processes presented in Fig. 4 can be employed
for light olefin production based on chemical recycling, which are dis-
cussed below.

Chemical recycling is becoming more important due to the existing
limitations  for  mechanical  recycling  processes  and  are  currently
considered the most promising method for recycling polyolefins [34].
Table  1  shows  the  common  thermochemical  processes  in  the  field  of
plastics  recycling,  which  result  in  different  products,  e.g.,  hydrogen
[35], petroleum liquids [36], and light olefins [37] depending on the
type of process and process conditions. Among the existing processes,
pyrolysis has received the most attention due to its simplicity, flexibility,
and the wide range of high added value products possible.

Pyrolysis, with or without a catalyst, is envisaged to be a suitable
process for plastic waste recycling in an environment-friendly manner
[54–57].  Pyrolysis  of  plastic  wastes  yields  hydrogen  [35],  petroleum
liquids  [36], light olefins [37], light  gasses (C1–C4  alkanes)  and solid
char [58]. Another possible product during specifically the pyrolysis of
waste  tires  is  carbon  black  as  this  is  used  as  an  additive  to  the
styrene-butadiene  rubber  of  the  tires  [59,60,61].  During  thermal  py-
rolysis, radicals are formed at temperatures between 400 and 1000
C,
and radical reactions cause cracking of the long polymer chains. Alter-
natively, a catalyst (usually a solid acid) can be used to catalyze cracking
reactions  leading  to  a  lower  reaction  temperature  while  tuning  the
product selectivity.

◦

Pyrolysis can be done in different ways in terms of heating rate (slow,
fast,  and  flash)  [62–64],  different  environments  (hydrogen,  steam,
oxidative, and vacuum) [65–67] or different heating methods (micro-
wave,  plasma, and electrical) [68,69]. After  the process is  optimized,
scaled up, and commercialized, pyrolysis can therefore be an adequate
way  to  eliminate  plastic  waste.  Millions  of  tons  of  greenhouse  gas
emissions (2.5 t CO2/t of plastic waste) can be prevented by converting
plastic wastes into usable chemicals instead of incinerating them [36,70,
71].

Initially, research on pyrolysis of waste polyolefins focused more on
the production of liquid fuels, which is relatively easier to accomplish
and  was mostly based on existing catalytic cracking technology [72].
However, the high cost of purification and hydrotreating related to the
presence of olefins and contaminants increases the cost associated with
this route [73]. Steam reforming and hydrogen production of plastics are
also economically not competitive due to the high price of plastic wastes
compared to other raw materials such as biomass or methane [74].

Processes that receive increasing attention are the direct or two-stage
light  olefin  production  from  waste  polyolefins  [75–77].  Selective

production of valuable ethylene, propylene, and butadiene could make
this process an attractive solution for closed-loop chemical recycling of
plastic waste. These monomer recovery processes from polyolefins can
be thermal, catalytic, or a combination of both [76].

Fluid  catalytic  cracking  (FCC)  is  a  well-established  process  in  the
petrochemical  industry  wherein  heavy  hydrocarbon  fractions  are
cracked to lighter products over solid acid catalysts (mostly based on
◦
C [78].
Zeolite Y). It is conducted at temperatures between 550 and 760
By applying ZSM-5-based additives and relatively severe reaction con-
ditions,  the  selectivity  can  be  tuned  toward  light  olefins,  which  is
referred  to  as  deep  catalytic  cracking  (DCC)  [39,79].  Several  studies
have reported using FCC-like processes to recycle plastic waste [80–82],
e.g., by mixing the waste stream with a VGO feed. The use of catalytic
processes  allows  to  decrease  the  reaction  temperature  compared  to
purely thermal processes. Moreover, the use of a catalyst allows to steer
the desired product selectivity to obtain a more narrow product distri-
bution. The main disadvantage of catalytic processes for the chemical
recycling of plastic waste is the fast deactivation of the catalysts. The
many impurities present in the plastic such as nitrogen, sulfur and alkali
metals result in catalyst deactivation due to catalyst poisoning. There-
fore, a thorough pretreatment and purification of the plastic waste feed
is paramount to prolonging the catalyst lifetime. However, the deacti-
vation of zeolites in FCC of plastic waste is unavoidable due to the coking
or poisoning of the acidic aluminosilicates. Continuous or at least peri-
odic/frequent catalyst regeneration should thus be an essential part of
the reactor technology during FCC of plastic waste, similar to the con-
ventional FCC process.

◦

Hydrocracking (HC) is the main production process for diesel and jet
fuel, starting from heavy crude feeds. HC is a catalytic process typically
operated between 300 and 450
C and at high hydrogen pressures of
20–150 bar [83]. The process is known for both its flexibility (a wide
range of reaction products is achievable by only varying process con-
ditions) and its versatility (hydrocracking can serve many purposes in
the petrochemical industry) [83]. It is especially used for the cracking of
heavy feeds such as vacuum gas oils (VGO) due to its robustness against
contaminants  [84].  Therefore,  HC  has  also  been  investigated  for  the
conversion  of  biomass  to  biofuels  [85–87],  or  for  the  conversion  of
plastic waste to naphtha-like liquids [47,88,89]. To process the plastic
waste, a prior low-temperature pyrolysis is performed to liquify the feed
after which it is fed to the hydrocracker [32,90]. This combination of
pyrolysis  and  hydrocracking  should  not  be  confused  with  catalytic
hydropyrolysis, used for the production of fuels [50,91]. With catalytic
hydropyrolysis,  first  an  in-situ  catalytic  pyrolysis  in  the  presence  of
hydrogen is performed, after which the obtained pyrolysis oil is upgra-
ded by a hydrotreatment in the second reactor [49]. In comparison with

FCC, HC is performed at much higher pressures and lower temperatures.
A HC catalyst differs also significantly from its FCC counterpart, as a HC
catalyst is a bifunctional catalyst consisting of an acidic zeolite and a
metal  site  [92].  The  metal  site  promotes  the  dehydrogenation  of  the
hydrocarbon to promote the cracking reaction. The cracked olefins are
afterwards hydrogenated by the excess of hydrogen present, to obtain a
fully saturated cracked product.

◦

One of the main advantages of hydrocracking is its robustness as the
presence hydrogen removes the present heteroatoms such as (N, S, O,
and halogens). This makes HC currently more applicable for the recy-
cling of plastic waste compared to FCC. However, HC requires the use of
an excessive amount of expensive hydrogen and produces less valuable
fuels compared to the light olefins obtained in FCC [48,89,93]. When
naphtha  is  produced  via  the  HC  or  FCC  of  plastic  waste,  the  corre-
sponding product can be used as feed for steam cracking (SC), wherein
hydrocarbons  are  cracked  in  radical  reactions  at  temperatures  of
800–1000
C  while steam  is  added  as  a  diluent  to prevent  secondary
reactions.  A  downside  of  SC  is  that  for  hydrocarbons  heavier  than
naphtha,  usually  extensive  coking  is  encountered  [94].  Catalytic
cracking can be employed to convert naphtha or a middle distillate feed
into light olefins with the aid of a solid acid catalyst [95]. This process
can be run at temperatures that are milder than those used for SC, while
the process is less sensitive towards the feed composition [42]. Gasifi-
cation entails the partial oxidation of a hydrocarbon feed towards syn-
thesis gas or syngas being CO and H2 (CO2 and CH4 are obtained as side
products) [96–98]. It is usually conducted at relatively high tempera-
◦
tures  ranging  from  700  to  1500
C,  at  atmospheric  pressure,  in  the
presence of pure oxygen, air, or steam [99]. The type of gasifying is an
important process variable when designing a gasification plant [100].
When using air, a major fraction of nitrogen and nitrous oxides is ob-
tained in the product fraction. This can challenge the process control and
requires further downstream purification to separate the nitrogen con-
taining compounds from the syngas. Moreover, a larger volume of air is
required to achieve a similar amount of oxygen compared to using pure
oxygen.  Consequently,  a  larger  gasifying  reactor  is  required  for  the
gasification of the same amount of plastic waste, increasing the capital
expenditures.  In  contrast,  employing  pure  oxygen  for  gasification  is
more expensive than air, increasing the operation costs. The presence of
steam  increases  the  H2/CO  ratio  making  the  produced  syngas  more
valuable [101].

Gasification  is  a  versatile  process  as  it  can  convert  many  types  of
different feedstocks such as biomass, coal, plastic waste or other organic
waste  [96].  Therefore  gasification  is  a  commonly  investigated  and
applied process making it mature technology and industrially relevant
[102]. While gasification has been mostly investigated for biomass and
coal,  studies  for  plastic  waste  gasification  show  much  potential  [97].
Due to the solid and viscous nature of plastic waste, it is important to
employ a gasification reactor with high heat transfer. Therefore, fluid-
ized bed reactors (in different configurations) are the most commonly
applied reactor technologies for plastic waste gasification [99,103]. The
obtained  synthesis  gas  can  be  used  either  for  olefin  production  via
Fischer-Tropsch  synthesis  or  methanol  synthesis  [104].  Subsequently,
methanol  can  be  converted  to  light  olefins  in  the  so-called  meth-
anol-to-olefins (MTO) process [105].

Another  process  for  the  production  of  syngas  is  the  pyrolysis  of

◦

plastic waste followed by inline steam reforming of the volatiles [106,
107]. In this manner, a hydrogen rich syngas is obtained in a sustainable
fashion. Barbarias et al. found that polyolefins are an excellent feedstock
for achieving high hydrogen yields, while maintaining catalyst stability
compared to PS [108]. First, pyrolysis is performed at low temperature
C volatilizing the plastic waste, after which the gasses are
around 500
catalytically converted to syngas [53]. The operating temperature for
◦
C as this balances the
catalytic reforming ranges between 600 and 800
reactivity  and  catalyst  stability  [106].  Steam  reforming  catalysts  are
metal catalysts among which Ni-based are the most popular due to their
activity  and  price  [35].  These  catalysts  are  widely  employed  for
methane  reforming  but  other  elements  suh  as  Co  and  Rh  have  been
studied  as  well  [109].  Combining  pyrolysis  and  steam  reforming  has
direct benefits compared to syngas production via gasification of plastic
waste. First, the operating temperature of the former process is lower
than with gasification making pyrolysis and steam reforming less energy
intensive. Additionally, the syngas obtained via steam reforming has a
higher H2/CO ratio making it a more valuable product. However, the
technology for the pyrolysis and steam reforming of plastic waste is not
industrially  ready  as  more  research  on  the  reactor  technology  and
catalyst  is  required  [35].  The  high  endothermicity  of  the  steam
reforming and  the  fast deactivation  of the  catalyst  pose currently the
main  challenges  for  this  process  [110].  By  co-feeding  oxygen  and
partially combusting the formed coke, both of these limitations might be
overcome as this releases heat and reactivates the catalyst [111,112].
The synthesis gas produced via either gasification or steam reforming
can then be directly converted to olefins. This is a CO hydrogenation
route via Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FT), which consists of a complex
reaction network. The main products of FT, with cobalt or iron used as
the catalyst are hydrocarbons ranging from methane to heavy paraffins
[113].  The  direct  synthesis  of  C2–C3  olefins  from  syngas  with  high
selectivity (>60 %) is a big challenge, but generally iron-based FT cat-
◦
alysts operated at higher temperatures (250–400
C) are better suited for
this. Jiao and coworkers [114] applied FT for converting synthesis gas
(syngas) to light olefins directly. At carbon monoxide (CO) conversion of
17%, the selectivity of light olefins and C2–C4 was reached as high as 80
and  94  %,  respectively.  A  potential  promoted  catalyst  (ZnCrOx/me-
so‐SAPO-34) affording two types of active sites was used to activate CO
and H2 by the partially reduced oxide surface (ZnCrOx) and manipulate
C–C  coupling  within  the  confined  acidic  pores  of  zeolites.  In  the  FT
process, no obvious deactivation is observed within 110 h. It is assumed
that  CO  first  is  activated  on  the  ZnCrOx  oxide  surfaces  with  oxygen
vacancies  to  form  CO2  and  C,  i.e.,  the  Boudouard  reaction,  and  C  is
transformed  into  CH2  species  in  the  presence  of  hydrogen,  which  is
subsequently  converted  to  ketene,  i.e.,  CH2CO  as  a  key  intermediate.
Ketene intermediate diffuses into the zeolite mesoporous SAPO channel,
where it is transformed into light olefins [115]. The syngas catalysts and
their process conditions are classified in Table 2.

◦

SAPO-34 is an excellent MTO catalyst as the C–C coupling compo-
nent. The optimized temperature for SAPO-34 catalyzed C2–C4 olefins is
400–450
C. However, methanol synthesis at such high temperature is
thermodynamically restrained. Thermodynamic calculations show that
the coupling with the MTO reaction, which is thermodynamically more
feasible at higher temperature, can drive the conversion of syngas and
◦
the formation of lower olefins is thermodynamically feasible at 400
C.

Gibbs free energy (ΔrG) values for the conversion of syngas to ethylene
(cid:0) 1, respectively. The
C were 7.5 and 7.1 kJ⋅mol

equilibrium yield of ethylene and propylene for the conversion of syngas
with a pressure of 10 bar (H2/CO = 2/1) were 68 and 57 % at 400
C,
respectively.  When  methanol  synthesis  and  methanol  dehydration  re-
actions are employed in tandem, the thermodynamics is forced to shift
toward  the  desired  direction.  The  mitigation  from  a  thermodynamic
point of view, the simultaneous production of ethylene and propylene
via hydrogenation of CO is an interesting and efficient way to overcome
the  limitation  of  methanol  synthesis  and  subsequent  dehydration  of
represents a promising process for the industrial applications [120].

In this review paper, the parameters and factors affecting the thermal
and catalytic pyrolysis of polyolefins are investigated, focusing on light
olefin production. The suitable reactors with short residence time and
high heat and mass transfer are discussed as potential reactors in the
field of light olefin production. In the following, the full recyclability of
polyolefins with considering environmental factors is studied.

2. Thermal pyrolysis

Ethylene and propylene production from different feedstocks have
found particular importance in the worldwide petrochemical industry
[121,122].  High  production  efficiencies  of  light  olefins  from  waste
polyolefins may be achieved, making the process attractive to various
industries [123,124]. In light olefins production using thermal pyrolysis,
many Factors can affect the composition of the final products and are
hence discussed in this section.

2.1. Thermal degradation mechanism

The  first  stage  in  pyrolysis  encompasses  the  melting  of  the  solid
polyolefin  feed.  Under  heating,  Van  der  Waals  interactions  between
polymer chains are relaxed, and a viscous melt is obtained. In the second
stage, the chemical bonds in the polyolefin structure are broken up at
higher temperatures, commonly explained by the radical mechanism of
random  chain  scission  and  β-elimination.  According  to  this  radical
mechanism, monomolecular and bimolecular reactants contribute to the
formation  of  various  products,  which  can  be  steered  by  process  pa-
rameters such as temperature and heating rate [125–127]. The direct
production  of  light  olefins  from  polyolefins  is  often  considered  to  be
‘difficult’,  mostly  because  of  the  large  amounts  of  energy  that  are
required for these processes while there are competing reactions leading
to coke formation. The decomposition of polyolefins is strongly endo-
thermic  because  relatively  strong  –C–C  σ-bonds  are  broken  up.  To
illustrate this: ethylene formation from a  polyethylene chain involves
breaking a –C–C σ-bond (bond enthalpy of approximately 346 kJ/mol
at 273 K) and creating a –C–C π-bond with a bond enthalpy of app. 256
kJ/mol at 273 K, resulting in a ΔH of 90 kJ/mol. Other factors that play
a role in the product spectrum are the different reactivities between the
light  olefins.  In  principle,  the  stability  of  olefins  increases  with
decreasing  carbon  number,  making  the  decomposition  of  polyolefin
chains thermodynamically favorable. In the case of propylene and buta
(di)enes  however,  hyperconjugation  decreases  their  stability  with
respect  to  ethylene.  The  electrons  of  the  –C–H  σ-bonds  in  the  alkyl
group adjacent to the double bond interact with the electrons of the C=C
π-bond. This delocalization of electrons results in greater relative sta-
bility, which is reflected in a lower enthalpy of hydrogenation and lower

Gibbs free energy of formation compared to ethylene [128].

The thermal decomposition of polyolefins during pyrolysis is initi-
ated  by  homolytic  bond  scissions.  During  those  homolytic  scissions,
initial  radical  intermediates  are  formed  that  react  with  the  polymer
chains  and  result  in  further  decomposition  through  a  radical  mecha-
nism.  With  the  increasing  temperature  in  pyrolysis,  the  total  energy
exceeds the bond energy of certain bonds, and homolytic bond scissions
initiate radical formation [129]. Higher temperatures result in a greater
extent  of  chain  scission  and  hence  radical  intermediates  and  final
products with a lower molecular weight [130]. In modeling the thermal
decomposition of polyolefins, typically, only one or two bond types are
considered to model the initial radical formation. For example, to model
the thermal decomposition of HDPE, Levine et al.  [131] assumed the
scission of a C–C –bond with the formation of two secondary radicals
and the scission of an end-of-chain –C–C–C=C bond with the formation
of a secondary radical and allyl radical. However, the energy required
for  the  scission  of  different  bond  types  can  vary  significantly  [132].
Those differences  in energy are caused by a  different orbital overlap,
electron distribution, rotational rates, and steric hindrance [133]. As a
result,  structural  changes  or  defects  in  the  polymer  chain  can signifi-
cantly  influence  the  thermal  decomposition  mechanism  and  the  light
olefin yield.

In  Fig.  5  an  overview  is  given  of  bond  dissociation  energies  of
different typical bonds in a polyolefin microstructure. The bond energies
are calculated from the formation enthalpies ΔHf(0 K) of small mole-
cules and radicals that have bonds representative for the bonds in the
larger polymer chain. In this work, the calculations are performed at the
CBS-QB3 level of theory, assuming the ideal gas phase. The least stable
bonds are the O–O –and C–O– bonds in the peroxide group. Typically,
only  a  small  number  of  peroxide  groups  are  present  in  the  polymer
chains, those are formed during the degradation of the polymer chain
and reaction with environmental oxygen. Even though degradation and
the formation of peroxide groups are highly undesirable for the poly-
olefin properties during its usage and mechanical recycling, for example,
the polymer stability, the presence of such bonds could be beneficial in
the initial radical formation steps for pyrolysis and significantly lower
the temperature required in the pyrolysis reactor [134–136]

Different  –C–C  and  –C–H  bond  types  that  can  be  present  in  the
microstructures  of  polyolefin  are  indicated  in  Fig.  5  (red  and  blue,
respectively). The least stable hydrocarbon bonds are those that result in
the formation of resonantly stabilized radicals, i.e., the benzyl and allyl
radicals.  From  these  values,  it  is  expected  that  the  pyrolysis  of  poly-
styrene and polybutadiene occurs at lower temperatures compared to
saturated  polyolefins.  The  presence  of  double  bonds  from  structural
defects in PE and PP can lower the decomposition temperature of those
polyolefins.

Fig. 6 shows sixteen highly probable reactions of polyolefin degra-
dation. The connected rigid C=C double bond to high rotating –C–C
single bonds makes the double bonds -along the polymer chains- act as a
center of stress concentration. Chain scission occurs in the vicinity of
double bonds (Fig. 6 reactions 1–6) and most of the heavy olefins are
converted  to  lighter  α-olefins,  β-olefins,  1,3-dienes,  paraffins  and  al-
kynes. A low number of double bonds in the polymer chain, increases the
probability  of  random  chain  scission  (Fig.  6,  reactions  7–9).  Further-
more,  regarding  the  higher  rotational  freedom  at  the  end  of  a  chain,
there is a possibility of chain-end scission resulting in the production of
light olefins and paraffins. In all pyrolysis processes, even at low and

moderate temperatures, a remarkable amount of gas is produced, most
of which are light olefins. However, the rate of chain-end scissions in-
creases  at  higher  temperature  [137].  In  the  following,  the  chain
re-scission  of  α-olefins  can  result  in  the  production  of  C=C–R–C=C
(α,ω-diolefin)  as  one  of  the  prevalent  products  (Fig.  6,  reaction  10)
[137].

The chain branching reaction under normal conditions rarely occurs
except at very high temperatures and/or pressures (Fig. 6, reaction 12).
With increasing temperature, the produced components (R–C, R–C=C,
R–C=C–C,  C=C–R–C=C,  R–C=C–C=C,  and  alkyne)  may  follow  again
reactions 1–13 (Fig. 6), and the length of paraffins, olefins, and dienes
decreases (R → 0) clearly, which results in the production of light olefins
and paraffins. Some of these light olefins react with olefins, alkyne, and/
or dienes in bimolecular reactions to produce naphthenes, and (poly)
aromatics (Fig. 6, reactions 13–16). Reactions 13 to 16 are a combina-
tion  of  different  bimolecular  reactions,  including  cross-linking,  Diels-
Alder, repolymerization, HACA, and finally, carbonization [137].

2.2. Effect of temperature

Extensive  research  on  the  effect  of  temperature  in  thermal  and
catalyzed pyrolysis on the selectivity toward light olefins is available in
the literature [76,123,124,138–140]. In thermal pyrolysis, the optimum
temperature range to obtain a high yield of light olefins is between 750
and 900

C [123].

◦

Green and Sadrameli [130] investigated the effect of temperature in
the range of 400 to 1000
C on the various products of HDPE pyrolysis
using  a  continuous  fluidized  bed  reactor  (Fig.  7).  The  pyrolysis  of
C  due  to  the
polyethylene  achieves  complete  conversion  above  650
short residence time (0.81–1.45 s). C1–4 compounds were insignificant at
◦
C, and the products predominantly comprised
temperatures below 500
C12+. The production of hydrogen and light hydrocarbons (C1–4) started
from 500
C,
leading to maxima in the products such as C3  (max: 24 wt.%) and C4
(max: 19 wt.%). While ethylene (max: 41 wt.%) presented a maximum
C and methane (0–15.5 wt.%) showed an increasing
peak around 900
trend in the studied temperature range. Interestingly, with a slight in-
crease  in  temperature  above  700
C,  the  yields  of  propylene  and

C, increased in the studied temperature range up to 700

for melting and “activating” the polypropylene feedstock before feeding
it into a fluid bed operated with product gas for further pyrolysis. Park

bonds and activates them for the subsequent pyrolysis. Optimizing the
temperatures  of  the  auger  reactor  (as  feeder)  and  the  bubbling  and
freeboard zones of the fluidized bed reactor were effective in the light
◦
olefin production. At a bubbling zone temperature of ~710
C, with an
C),  methane
increasing  auger  reactor  temperature  (from  26  to  400
(34–43  wt.%)  and  hydrogen  (1–6  wt.%)  increased  while  the  yield  of
aromatics (28–17 wt.%) and light olefins (26–24 wt.%) decreased. The
◦
change in bubbling zone temperature (621–727
C) led to an increase in
the  aromatics  (12–25  wt.%).  With  decreasing  freeboard  temperature
◦
(784–398
C), light olefins (24–45 wt.%) increased significantly while a
strong decrease in the methane yield (from 40 to 22 wt.%) and yield of
polyaromatics (from 12 to 1 wt.%) was observed. This was attributed to
decreased secondary reactions and indicated that the residence time of
the cracked products in the hot freeboard zone of the fluid bed was too
long. While the vapor residence time was not varied in Park et al.’s work
[76], it is likely that shortening the vapor residence time (by increasing
the  gas  flow  rate)  could  have  achieved  a  similar  effect  as  effectively
shortening  the  heated  zone  by  decreasing  the  freeboard  temperature
from 784 to 398
C. Raising the auger reactor temperature (from 26 to
C)  increased  methane  (34–43  wt.%)  and  hydrogen  (1–6  wt.%),
400
while the yield of aromatics (28–17 wt.%) and light olefins (26–24 wt.
%) decreased. The change in bubbling zone temperature (621–727
C)
led to an increase in the aromatics (12–25 wt.%).

Artetxe and coworkers [123] indicated that the two-step pyrolysis
process could be an interesting alternative to catalytic/thermal pyrolysis
for selectively producing light olefins. In this process, wax (67 wt.%) was
◦
the main product in a CSBR at 500
C. In the second step, a multi-tubular
quartz  reactor  thermally  cracked  the  volatiles  produced  in  the  first
reactor.  In  the  studied  temperature  range  (800–950
C),  light  olefins
production  (77.4  wt.%)  showed  a  peak  at  900
C,  with  the  obtained
yields for ethylene, propylene, and butenes of 40.4, 19.5, and 17.5 wt.%,
respectively. Kaminsky et al. [141] investigated the thermal pyrolysis of
polyethylene in the temperature range of 600–800
C using a fluidized
bed reactor. The production of light olefins reached the maximum yield
◦
(61 wt.%) at 700
C. This demonstrates that a catalyst is not necessarily
required to produce fairly high yields of light olefins. The absence of a
catalyst  makes  the  process  more  robust  and  improves  its  economics
since, e.g., cheap sand can be used as a fluid bed material. However, the
drawbacks of this solution are the fairly high temperature required for
endothermic  thermal  cracking,  rendering  the  process  highly  energy
intensive  and  also  the  produced  propylene/ethylene  ratio  of  0.48  is
much lower than that of catalytic pyrolysis.

◦

Table  3  summarizes  the  thermal  pyrolysis  of  polyolefins  for  the
production of light olefins under different process parameters, reactors,
and  temperatures.  A  discussion  on  the  combined  effect  of  altering
temperature and residence time is provided in Section 2.3. Based on the
literature review, thermal pyrolysis of plastics using a suitable reactor
and under optimal temperature and short residence time can produce up
to 90% light olefins. The main point to note is that in almost all cases, the
ratio of P/E is less than 1, and ethylene forms the majority of light olefins
under optimal conditions.

2.2.1. Reactor temperature profile

◦

Having a large temperature gradient, i.e., a non-isothermal temper-
ature profile in the reactor, can increase the production of undesirable
pyrolysis  by-products,  especially  at  temperatures  above  700
C.  The
formation of valuable pyrolysis products such as propylene and buta-
diene is highly sensitive towards temperature and temperature fluctu-
ations or gradients in reactors. Non-isothermal temperature profiles can
be seen in almost all pyrolysis reactors and therefore have an underlying
effect on the distribution of products. Hartulistiyoso et al. [148] inves-
tigated the temperature profile in an axial direction of the cylindrical
◦
flow reactor and found a large temperature gradient from 293 to 450
C.
Yuliansyah et al. [149] studied the ex-situ pyrolysis of LDPE in a catalytic
fixed bed reactor and found that the non-isothermal temperature profile
inside the reactor and the catalytic bed significantly affected the product

selectivity.  Designing  a  reactor  with  minimum  temperature  gradients
and ideally with an almost isothermal temperature profile can signifi-
cantly prevent undesirable by-products [123,150].

2.2.2. Heating rate

One of the most important parameters in the field of pyrolysis is the
heating rate of the feed that is processed. The effect of heating rates can
be easily obtained from TGA experiments, and it was shown that, e.g., in
the  pyrolysis  of  biomass,  the  heating  rate  has  a  strong  effect  on  the
product distribution, with slow heating favoring char formation [62].
(Fast) pyrolysis of plastic waste occurs at a heating rate of 10 ~ 200
(cid:0) 1 and generally yields 37 ~ 95 wt.% liquid oil [151]. The higher the
◦
C⋅s
heating  rate  during  pyrolysis,  the  faster  the  polymer  decomposition
takes  place.  Fig.  9  displays  the  TGA  of  MPO  waste  at  four  different
(cid:0) 1 [152]. Here it can be seen
◦
heating rates ranging from 5 to 40
that at higher heating rates, the actual polymer degradation occurs at
higher temperatures (Fig. 9(a)), resulting in higher reaction rates (Fig. 9
(b)).  The  higher  reaction  temperature  at  high  heating  rates  result  in
different product selectivities compared to lower heating rates. At high
temperature,  the  endothermic  primary  cracking reactions  are  favored
and the exothermic secondary suppressed. Second, the higher reaction
rates and corresponding shorter residence times result in less reaction
time for secondary reactions. Consequently, both these effects limit the
occurrence of secondary reaction at high heating rates and indicate the
importance of this variable on the product distribution.

C min

It is widely agreed that the time of residence should be less than 2 s as
longer residence times result in lower olefin yields through secondary
reactions [153]. With increasing heating rate, the tendency to secondary
reactions decreases, and chain scission plays the main role in pyrolysis.
The effect of the heating rate on double bonds is far greater than on other
hydrocarbon bonds, which is clearly seen in the degradation of PBR. In
the  degradation  of  PBR,  the  tendency  for  cross-linking  and  coke  for-
mation was reduced by increasing the heating rate due to shorter resi-
dence  time,  and  as  an  unusual  trend,  at  higher  heating  rates,  PBR
degraded at lower temperatures (Fig. 10). In general, for feedstocks with
a  high  concentration  of  double  bonds,  the  heating  rate  can  have  an
important  effect  on  the  degradation  mechanisms  and  final  products
[127,154].

◦

C⋅min

The ratio of primary chain scission reactions to the mentioned sec-
ondary  reactions  determines the  production of  coke and  aromatics in
pyrolysis [155]. Singh et al. [152] pyrolyzed a mixture of plastic wastes
(polyolefins:  78  wt.%)  under  two  different  heating  rates  of  10  and
(cid:0) 1  using  TGA  and  a  pyrolyzer-GC.  The  coke  production
20
decreased from 7 to 5 wt.%, and aromatics decreased from 38 to 29 wt.%
by increasing the heating rate. Encinar and Gonz ́alez [156] have studied
the  effect  of  heating  rate  on  the  pyrolysis  of  polyethylene  and  poly-
◦
propylene at 490
C using a TGA. By increasing the heating rate in LDPE
(cid:0) 1, the yield of coke (0.18–0.00 wt.%) and

increased (18–39 wt.%). In polypropylene pyrolysis, the produced coke
(0.11–0.10 wt.%) and oil (83–68 wt.%) decreased, and the produced gas
increased  significantly (17–32 wt.%) with an  increase in heating rate
◦
C⋅min-1). These examples demonstrate that high heating rates are
(5–20
beneficial for decreasing the extent of secondary reactions and thereby
avoiding the formation of polyaromatics which can further react to a
highly aromatic solid char/coke residue. In general, high heating rates
favor the formation of gaseous products and olefins whereas low heating
rates promote the formation of hydrogen, methane, aromatics and char
[152].

There are several ways to heat up the pyrolysis reactor and increase
the temperature, including radiative heated [157], hot carrier gas [158],
and  microwave assisted heating [159]. The advantages of  microwave
heating compared to conventional radiative heating (wall-heated) are
that it is volumetric, it is rapid and selective [160]. Microwave radiation
heats up a substance uniformly as a whole instead of heating the outer
surface first as in conventional heating. As stated previously, fast heating
rates as well as short residence times are other benefits of microwave
heating [161]. Mixing plastic waste with microwave absorbers such as
carbon during pyrolysis can improve energy absorption and conversion
into heat in shorter times [162]. The ultrafast heating process using arcs
can  generate  very  high  temperatures  up  to  1000
C  or  even  several
thousands  of  degrees  Celsius  in  only  tens  of  milliseconds,  which  is
extremely suitable for cracking hydrocarbons and polyolefins into ole-
fins because of the corresponding short residence times [163]. However,
a disadvantage of microwave reactors is the small penetration depth of
microwaves which amounts only to a few centimeters [164]. This limits
the industrial feasibility of microwave assisted heating as these reactors
should be able to handle large volumes of plastic waste.

2.3. Effect of residence time

Residence time is one of the key parameters that must be considered
in  the  reactor  design.  The  residence  time  should  be  high  enough  to
obtain sufficient conversion of the feedstock into lighter products but
short  enough  so  that  light  olefins  are  efficiently  removed  from  the
reactor,  thereby  preventing  secondary  reactions.  At  a  prolonged  resi-
dence  time,  the  produced  light  olefins  can  act  as  intermediates  in
bimolecular reactions and are then converted to aromatic compounds
and  coke [165].  Residence time  depends  on  various parameters,  e.g.,
reactor  design,  temperature,  pressure,  type  and  size  of  feedstock  and
feeding  type,  heating  rate,  etc.  Furthermore,  the  residence  time  of
feedstock in the reactor is completely different from the manufactured
products. Due to the possibility of participating in Diels-Alder reactions,
the produced light olefins should be removed from the reactor as soon as
possible. Furthermore, the pyrolysis products in the condenser should be
cooled down quickly to decrease the possibility of their conversion to
cyclic compounds [166–168].

◦

Milne  et  al.  [165]  have  considered  the  effect  of  residence  time
(400–600 ms) and temperature (780–860
C) for the pyrolysis of LDPE
using an internally circulating fluidized bed reactor. The results showed
that  by  increasing  the  residence  time,  the  production  of  light  olefins
decreased due to secondary reactions. Sodero et al. [145] considered the
◦
effect of residence time on the LDPE pyrolysis at 900
C in a Curie point
microreactor.  In  their  work,  the  yields  of  ethylene,  propylene,  and
butadiene  reached  maximum  values  for  a  residence  time  of  750  ms
(Fig.  11).  It should  be pointed  out  that their trends  are  unusual  with
respect to the observed decline of ethylene and increase in butene yield
when increasing the residence time from 750 to 1000 ms, considering
that ethylene has higher thermal stability compared to propylene and
butene. Therefore, one would expect to see a peak in both C3  and C4
olefin yields with increasing residence time and a continued increase of
ethylene.

Analyzing  the  data  by  Conesa  and  coworkers  [142]  obtained  for
pyrolysis of HDPE in a laboratory fluid bed at different residence times
(approximated  by  the  ratio  of  the  free  bed  volume  divided  by  the
injected  feedstock  mass)  shows  that  there  is  a  clear  peak  in  the  pro-
duction  of  propylene  and  butenes  in  the  temperature  range  of
◦
600–800
C, while ethylene showed an increasing trend. Only at a high
◦
temperature of 900
C a peak could also be discerned for ethylene, and at
such a high temperature, propylene and butenes were almost converted
completely, indicating severe over-cracking (Fig. 12).

Park  et  al.  [76]  examined  the  effect  of  residence  time  on  poly-
propylene pyrolysis under a nitrogen atmosphere at a temperature ~700
◦
C using a fluidized bed reactor. The produced coke (1.16–0.09 wt.%),

◦

◦

methane (21–13 wt.%), and aromatics (30–20 wt.%) were reduced, and
the  light olefin yields (37–52 wt.%) increased by  decreasing the resi-
dence time from 1.58 to 0.91 s.
◦
At low temperatures (< 600

C) the share of gaseous products tends
to  increase  with  increasing  residence  time.  At  higher  temperatures
(600–800
C),  the  secondary  reactions  become  increasingly  more
important resulting in an optimum for light olefins. The more the resi-
dence  time  increases,  the  more  propylene  and  larger  olefins  are  con-
verted  to  cyclic  species,  aromatics,  and  eventually  coke.  The  optimal
yield  of  ethylene  occurs  at  a  higher  residence  time  than  other  light
olefins, likely since ethylene is more thermally stable. When the tem-
perature  is  further  increased  to  900
C,  ethylene  is  the  only  relevant
olefin produced which is further cracked to methane and hydrogen at
high residence times. The other olefins act as precursors for aromatics
and cokes, whose yield increases further with increasing residence time.

◦

2.4. Effect of fluidization or dilution gas

An  inert  gas  such  as  nitrogen  or  helium  is  generally  employed  to
minimize  the  residence  time  of  volatiles,  assist  with  fluidization  as  a
diluent,  and  ensure  efficient  transport  of  light  products  out  of  the
reactor. While in a research context often nitrogen and helium are used,
steam provides more interesting properties for industry as this is both
cheaper and facilitates an easier downstream product separation than
helium and nitrogen. Moreover, steam improves heat transfer within the
reactor and limits the coke formation at elevated temperatures [169]. It
should  be  noted  that  two  residence  times  are  associated  with  plastic
pyrolysis,  being  the  residence  time  of  the  volatile  phase  and  of  the
plastic  melt  phase.  Typically,  the  residence  time  of  the  gas  phase  is
shorter than the polymer phase to minimize the occurrence of secondary
reactions  and  maximize  the  conversion  of  plastic  waste  [170].  Inert
gasses dilute the reactor atmosphere, thereby reducing the possibility of
bimolecular  reactions  [76].  In  several  studies  using  internally  circu-
lating reactors without adequate separation section, the product gasses
rich in light olefins (C5-) have been recycled to the pyrolysis reactor as
carrier gasses. This significantly increases the light olefin concentration
in  the  reactor  atmosphere,  therefore  enhancing  bimolecular  reactions
towards (poly)aromatics [76,140,141]. As an example, Park et al. [140]
studied the pyrolysis of polyethylene wastes using product gas and ni-
trogen as carrier gas. The produced light olefin increased from 37 to 58
wt.%, and the aromatics were somewhat reduced (from 22 to 19 wt.%)
with N2 as the carrier gas as compared to using recycled product gas.

◦

Using steam as the carrier gas can be an effective way to minimize
bimolecular reactions towards (poly)aromatics and coke [38]. This was
illustrated by Kaminsky et al. [141] when using product gas and steam
for the pyrolysis of LLDPE and HDPE, respectively, as the carrier gas at
700
C  in  a  fluidized  bed  reactor.  Steam  promoted  more  light  olefin
production (27.6 vs. 60.4 wt.%) with lower aromatics (24 vs. 11 wt.%)
and methane (24 vs. 10 wt.%) formation compared to using product gas.
Although the feedstocks were different in Kaminsky’s comparison, the
difference  between  HDPE  and  LLDPE  was  not  enough  to  create  this
amount  of  different  products,  and  the  type  of  carrier  gas  must  have
played a crucial role in the products.

Meng  et  al.  [171]  investigated  the  effect  of  carrier  gas  (steam  or
nitrogen) and temperature on the catalytic pyrolysis of heavy oil using a
confined  fluidized  bed  reactor.  In  the  studied  temperature  range
◦
(600–700
C), the production of light olefins using steam (50–60 wt.%)
was higher compared to using nitrogen (42–53 wt.%), and the produced
coke (20–13 wt.%) decreased using steam. In addition to diluting the
reaction medium and reducing the probability of bimolecular reactions,
steam increases the H/C ratio by producing CO2 (0.55–0.64 wt.%) and
releasing hydrogen, and to some extent, prevents the production of coke
and aromatics.

Integrating plastic waste conversion with steam cracking in a single
process  is  not  obvious  but  has  been  attempted.  Worldwide,  steam
cracking is the most prevalent process for the production of light olefins,

followed by light olefins production as an important by-product from
FCC. The general mechanism of the endothermic steam cracking process
involves millions of free radical reactions starting from the radical for-
mation via bond cleavage and ending with recombination of the formed
radicals. To a limited extent water reacts with carbon (coke) formed on
the  reactor  wall,  which  leads  to  the  production  of  CO2,  CO,  and  H2
[172]. The amount of coke formed during steam cracking is typically
less than 0.01 wt.%. As discussed in the previous section, the polyolefin
pyrolysis  at  moderate  temperatures  results  in  linear  and  non-linear
heavy  olefins  and  paraffin,  which  contain  between  5 and  20  wt.%  of
naphthenes and aromatics. However, using well-designed reactors with
very short residence times can play an effective role in reducing cyclic
compounds.  Various  researches  and  available  industrial  experiences
show that olefins and cyclic compounds in feedstocks can be detrimental
as  they  intensify  aromatization  reactions  and  coke  formation  in  the
steam  cracking  unit  [42].  In  addition,  organic  and  mineral  contami-
nants, some of which enter the steam cracking unit along with pyrolysis
oil, can facilitate the coke formation [44].

For the production of liquid fuels, recycled gasses from thermal py-
rolysis (product gas), which are rich in light olefins, would be prefer-
ential  to  enhance  bimolecular  reactions  such  as  Diels-Alder  and
aromatic production, while for the targeted production of light olefins,
steam  and/or  hydrogen  are  the  preferred  carrier  gasses  to  limit  aro-
matics and coke production [76,140,141,173]. Ideally, in a two-staged
system,  any  produced  light  olefins  from  a  first  thermal  pyrolysis
reactor should be separated from the stream before passing to a second
thermal  and/or  catalytic  reactor  stage.  The  higher  H/C  ratio  of  the
output from the thermal reactor would result in higher efficiency, ac-
tivity, and selectivity of the catalyst for producing light olefins [138].

Hydrogen as a more active carrier gas compared to inert gasses like
N2 or He was studied by several authors with the intention to limit coke
and  aromatics  formation.  Williams  and  Slaney  [174]  investigated the
effect  of  nitrogen  and  hydrogen  carrier  gas  on  the  pyrolysis  of  poly-
◦
propylene and polyethylene at 500
C. Olefins were the primary product
under  the  nitrogen  atmosphere,  while  hydrogen  tended  to  produce  a
saturated product. In general, to produce light olefins with high selec-
tivity in a thermal pyrolysis reactor, hydrogen (at suitable pressure) can
be beneficial for preventing coke formation and increasing the ratio of
chain scission/secondary reactions [174,175]. Considering a tolerance
for olefins in steam cracking feedstock of 2 wt.% as reported by Baum-
gartner  et  al.  [176],  the  concentration  of  unsaturated  hydrocarbons
needs to be substantially reduced with hydrotreatment and/or mixing
with saturated hydrocarbon at suitable ratios [177,178].

2.5. Pyrolysis oil formation

The use of MPO pyrolysis oils as feed for steam cracking or catalytic
processes has received much attention in recent years. As discussed, the
share of tertiary carbons (PP), aromatics (PS), double bonds (polymer

aging), and contaminants can affect the quality and quantity of pyrolysis
oil [42,44].

Fig. 13 shows the main pyrolysis products of various MPO compo-
nents,  e.g.,  PE,  PP,  PS,  HIPS  (PS  + PBR),  and  PVC  at  moderate  tem-
peratures. Components such as PS, PBR, and PVC are often present as
contaminants within MPO, and have an important influence on the re-
actions occurring during plastic waste pyrolysis.

In terms of degradation, the number of tertiary carbons and double
bonds is  the most  important structural difference  of waste and virgin
polyolefins (Fig. 13). In fact, the double bonds and the tertiary carbons
can determine the scission location of the polyolefin chains. The rotation
of a rigid double bond with intrinsic symmetry in a molecule is unlikely
and  would  involve  a  cis/trans  isomerization  [181].  The  difference  in
rotation restrictions between single and rigid double bonds could lead to
the double bonds causing the chain scission at high rotation rates [129,
133,181]. The side groups such as methyl (PP), ethyl (HDPE, LLDPE),
and phenyl (PS) have a similar effect and can facilitate scission in their
vicinity.  In  other  words,  the  difference  in  rotational  rate  between
different bonds of a chain can lead to chain scission at high rates (high
temperature) [101,182,183].

As can be seen, PS pyrolysis products are much smaller compared to
pyrolysis products from polyolefins [55,179]. The lower energy required
to form resonantly stabilized radicals causes the PS chains to break down
more  easily.  This  process  continues  until  the  end  of  degradation  and
results in styrene monomers and small amounts of dimers and trimers of
styrene [184]. For large groups of styrene adjacent to each other in a
quasi-isotactic  structure,  further  movement  freedom  of  the  phenyl
groups at the head or tail of the PS chain leads to an unzipping mech-
anism [185–187]. Similarly, the high degree of double bonds in poly-
butadiene cause the formation of resonantly stabilized radicals during
pyrolysis.  Those  facilitate  unzipping  and  depolymerization  with  the
formation of lighter products compared to other polyolefins at the same
temperature  [127,181,179,188,189].  In  the  pyrolysis  of  unsaturated
rubbers at moderate temperatures, the primary product is the related
monomer, while a significant part of olefins and dienes are converted to
(poly)aromatics  by  different  reactions,  such  as  monomolecular  and
bimolecular Diels Alder reactions [127,189,190].

◦
For the pyrolysis of PP at moderate temperatures (400–500

C), up to
60 wt.% are either propylene or other characteristic products of the PP
structure with oligomers of propylene (C3n). The diolefin components
(C3n+1) typically account for up to 25 wt.% of the products [180,191,
192].  During  the  pyrolysis  of  PP  and  PE,  even  at  low  and  moderate
temperatures, a remarkable amount of gas is produced, most of which
are light olefins. At higher temperatures, the radical intermediates and
products formed can react further in the monomolecular decomposition
of bimolecular reactions. The final product spectrum in this case moves
towards  compounds  with  high  thermal  stability  such  as  methane,
ethylene,  propylene,  butadiene,  and  (poly)aromatics  [130].  The  for-
mation  of  those  stable  products  occurs  through  similar  radical

mechanisms as in the pyrolysis or steam cracking of fossil fuels. Poly-
aromatics  and  coke  are  formed  at  a  significant  rate  with  increasing
temperatures  and  reactor  residence  times  through  for  example,  the
HACA mechanism [43,44,101,193].

The  structure  of  PVC  is  such  that  it  is  highly  sensitive  to  thermal
stress  and  releases  HCl  rapidly  with  increasing  temperature.  On  the
other hand, the remaining structure is a polyene, which is very prone to
Diels-Alder reactions. As can be seen in Fig. 13, the structure remaining
from the initial degradation of PVC quickly reacts with light olefins, and
diolefins produced from polyolefins pyrolysis, and the coke formation is
increased clearly in the pyrolysis of MPO [194].

The quality and quantity of MPO pyrolysis oil depend on the share of
PE, PP, PS, PVC, contamination, and plastic aging. However, in general,
results obtained by different research groups show that the more linear
the MPO is, the lower the amounts of double bonds, and the lower the
amounts of contaminants, the higher the amount of light olefins that are
produced [42,44,195].

3. Catalytic pyrolysis

◦

The thermal degradation of polymers to low molecular weight ma-
terials requires high temperatures (700 to 900
C) and short residence
times [196], with the significant drawback that a broad product range is
obtained  [197,198],  and  the  high  temperature  renders  the  process
highly energy-intensive. Introducing a catalyst to the pyrolysis step, in
general, lowers the decomposition temperature and leads to a narrower
product distribution [198–202]. Lowering the thermal energy required
for the process will increase its economic and environmental viability,
and  the  process  can  be  further  optimized  by  improving  activity/se-
lectivity and ensuring catalyst regenerability [203].

Traditionally,  the  catalysts  used  in  catalytic  cracking  procedures
include classical Lewis solid acids such as metal tetrachloroaluminates
[204], zeolites [205], superacids [204], gallosilicates [206], metals on
carbon  [207],  and  basic  metal  oxides  [208].  Catalytic  cracking  using
optimized catalysts can be more efficient in forming C2–C4 olefins than
thermal  processes  [209].  Zeolites  and  zeotypes  with  different  frame-
works,  compositions,  and  crystallinities  have  different  acidity  and
accessibility  leading  to  different  catalytic  performances  [210].  Cata-
lyzed  polyolefin  pyrolysis  using  solid  acids  is  rationalized  by

carbocation  intermediates  activated  by  Brønsted  acid  sites,  which  is
different from the radical mechanism of thermal pyrolysis [211]. Similar
to  thermal  pyrolysis,  catalytic  pyrolysis  can  proceed  through  mono-
molecular and/or bimolecular reactions, but catalytic pyrolysis gener-
lower  activation  energies.  In  catalytic  pyrolysis,  the
ally  has
monomolecular mechanism is dominant in medium-pore (10 MR) zeo-
lites like ZSM-5 with low acidity (high Si/Al), high temperature, and low
conversion.  The  bimolecular  mechanism  involves  the  formation  of
carbenium-like  species  by  hydrogen  transfer  to  pre-existing  (shorter)
chemisorbed  intermediates  and  their  cracking  by  β-scission  to  yield
shorter olefins [212].

Many parameters play an essential role in catalyst activity, deacti-
vation and selectivity, monomolecular and bimolecular reactions, and
reaction kinetics [76] which are discussed in the following sections.

3.1. Catalytic pyrolysis mechanism

The  mechanism  of  the  catalytic  pyrolysis  of  plastic  waste  closely
resembles  the  well-known  catalytic  cracking  mechanism  of  paraffins
[213]. Both processes require an acidic zeolite to crack hydrocarbons to
short-chain  hydrocarbons  with  formation  of  olefins,  aromatics,  and
coke. The main difference between catalytic pyrolysis of plastic waste
and the well-known catalytic cracking of paraffins is the type of feed.

to

There are two dominant pathways accepted for the catalytic cracking
of  paraffins,  the  monomolecular  Haag-Dessau  mechanism  and  the
bimolecular  pathway  (Fig.  14)  [214–216].  According
the
Haag-Dessau mechanism, paraffin directly undergoes a protolytic scis-
sion,  which  results  in  the  formation  of  a  carbenium-ion  and  shorter
paraffin. The monomolecular pathway is responsible for the production
of short-chain molecules such as hydrogen, methane, and ethane, which
are observed during catalytic pyrolysis [215]. The transition state for the
Haag-Dessau  mechanism  is  an  unstable  penta-coordinated  carbon-
ium-ion which results in high activation energy for this protolytic scis-
sion [195]. The higher the acidity and activity of the zeolite, the more
this activation barrier will be decreased, which clarifies the increased
formation  of  methane  in  highly  acidic  zeolites.  In  the  bimolecular
pathway,  the  paraffin  undergoes  a  hydrogen-abstraction  by  a  cation,
after which it is cracked by a β-scission [217]. In the past, it was debated
whether  the  formed  carbenium-ions  during  catalytic  cracking  were

actually  present  in  the  shape  of  alkoxides  at  the  reaction  conditions.
However, it was shown that carbenium-ions are the actual intermediates
formed  during  catalytic  cracking  due  to  a  higher  entropy  at  elevated
temperatures [218]. It should be noted that the bimolecular pathway
has  significantly  lower  activation  energy  than  the  monomolecular
pathway [216]. Therefore, in catalytic cracking of paraffins it is argued
that  at  low  conversions  and  low  carbenium-ion  concentrations,  the
monomolecular  pathway  is  prevalent.  Once  a  certain  carbenium-ion
concentration  has  been  established  by  monomolecular  cracking,  the
bimolecular  pathway  becomes  quickly  more  dominant  at  the  higher
conversion levels.

The presence of olefins in the feed for catalytic pyrolysis changes this
story. Olefins are easily protonated by zeolites which results in a higher
concentration  of  carbenium-ions  compared  to  the  standard  catalytic
cracking  of  paraffins.  The  increased  concentration  of  carbenium-ions
favors  the  hydrogen-abstraction  and,  consequently,  the  bimolecular
pathway  [213,219].  Therefore,  the  bimolecular  pathway  is  the  domi-
nant initiation step for the cracking of plastic waste, with the protolytic
scission  of  paraffins  only  occurring  to  a  limited  extent.  This  is  also
confirmed by the high share of propylene and butenes observed in the
product yields [195,220]. Butene and propylene are the smallest olefins
that can be formed via the bimolecular pathway, whereas the low yield
of ethylene proves that monomolecular cracking is less present. Next to
deprotonation and hydrogen abstraction, the carbenium-ions stabilize
themselves  via  isomerization  reactions  like  PCP-branching,  intra-
molecular H-shifts, and methyl-shifts [213].

Next to olefins, the plastic waste vapors consist of a large fraction of
diolefins [44]. Dienes give rise to the formation of naphthenes as they
can form cyclic species via a Diels-Alder reaction or by the cyclization of
an olefinic carbenium-ion (Fig. 14). The latter occurs when one olefinic
group is protonated by the zeolite, after which the other nucleophilic
unsaturated bond attacks the positively charged carbon atom to form a
cyclic  hydrocarbon.  Naphthenes  can,  after  protonation,  undergo  an
endocyclic β-scission, which is the reverse step of the cyclization of a
carbenium-ion. This is however less thermodynamically favorable than
an  exocyclic  β-scission  where  an  alkyl  group  is  removed  from  the
naphthenic  ring  [221].  Naphthenes  also  give  rise  to  the  formation  of
aromatics  by  sequentially  undergoing  a  hydride-abstraction  and

deprotonation.  In  this  manner,  naphthenes  are  quickly  converted  to
cycloalkenes, cycloalkadienes, and aromatics [222].

As diolefins are easily converted to naphthenes which in their turn
are  precursors  for  aromatics,  a  considerable  fraction  of  aromatics  is
formed during the catalytic pyrolysis of plastics [219]. These aromatics
are  known  to  be  precursors  for  coke  which  deactivates  the  catalyst
[222]. The presence of olefins, naphthenes, and aromatics during the
catalytic conversion of plastic waste results in an increased deactivation
of the catalyst compared to standard cracking feeds. Of course, the type
of catalyst has a major influence on the reaction kinetics and the deac-
tivation rate.

Since  the  zeolite  surface  has  lower  adsorption  energy,  most  chain
scission occurs inside the zeolite pores. Therefore, the pore size of the
catalyst  is  an  important  catalyst  property  as  this  determines  whether
reactants  can  enter  and  which  transition  states  and  products  can  be
formed  [223–225].  These  effects  are  generally  summarized  by  the
“shape  selectivity”  of  the  catalyst  [226].  When  using  a  micro-porous
catalyst, few of the long-chained reactants can enter the catalyst pores
which  results  in  a  low  catalytic  activity  [227].  However,  in
macro-porous  catalysts, the  possibility of  complex formation between
double  bonds  and  active  sites  is  substantially  reduced,  resulting  in
higher  molecular  weight  products  [54].  Additionally,  macro-porous
catalysts do not suppress the formation of secondary reactions such as
the formation of aromatics and coke, which can result in low catalytic
stability.

In catalytic reactors, in addition to catalytic pyrolysis, there is always
the possibility of thermal degradation [168]. By using micropore cata-
lysts with unsuitable input and output accessibility, catalysts with high
deactivation rate, or catalysts with very low activity, the possibility of
thermal  pyrolysis  is  clearly  increased.  For  this  reason,  high  levels  of
heavy  hydrocarbons  in  the  pyrolysis  products  indicate  catalyst  in-
efficiency, and solutions should be sought to improve catalyst perfor-
mance  [228–230].  Furthermore,  the  intensification  of  primary  (high
methane production) and secondary (aromatization and coke produc-
tion) reactions indicate excessive catalyst activity, which are inhibited
by reducing the temperature, the ratio of catalyst/feedstock, or using a
less active catalyst (lower acidity) [231,232].

3.2. Contact mode (ex-situ and in-situ)

The contact mode between the catalyst and the polymer can signif-
icantly affect the performance and efficiency of the catalyst [139,175].
Tables 4 and 5 show the in-situ and ex-situ pyrolysis results of polyolefins
using different catalysts. These tables show different pyrolysis products
from  light  olefins  to  methane  and  aromatics  under  the  two  different
catalyst  contact  modes.  Different  process  conditions  from  the  type  of
reactors  used  to  the  applied  process  temperature,  the  ratio  of  cata-
lyst/feedstock, and the type of feed and catalyst are given. In general,
both  modes  have  their  advantages  and  disadvantages,  while  their
optimal process parameters are different. In addition, the P/E ratio is a
key  parameter  using  various  feedstocks,  which  in  catalytic  pyrolysis
(Tables  4  and  5)  is  much  higher  than  in  thermal  pyrolysis  (Table  3).
Although the  in-situ  mode is  simpler and  requires less  process  equip-
ment,  the  plastic  contamination  can  deactivate  the  catalyst  quickly
because  of  the  direct  contact  of  plastic  melt  and  catalyst.  Since  the
decontamination of plastic is very expensive, the ex-situ mode indicates
a higher industrialization capability. Moreover, the ex-situ mode allows
to  select  two  different  temperatures  for  the  thermal  and  catalytic
reactor. This is beneficial for a continuous operation of the reactor, as
this  allows  to  counteract  the  deactivation  of  the  catalyst  by  slowly
increasing the temperature of the catalytic reactor to compensate for the
loss of activity [233]. Lastly, the direct contact of the catalyst with long
polymer chains in-situ mode makes it more difficult for the feedstock to
reach the active sites, while in ex-situ contact mode the access of thermal
pyrolysis products to the active sites faces fewer problems.

Xue et al. [175] investigated the in-situ and ex-situ pyrolysis of PE and
PP  in  a  tandem  micropyrolysis  reactor  with  helium  and  hydrogen  as
carrier  gasses (Fig.  15).  The product  distribution for  the catalytic  py-
rolysis of polyethylene and polypropylene is presented in Fig. 16a & b,
respectively. The share of light olefins (C2–C4) in ex-situ was about 80
wt.% and close to 30 wt.% for in-situ. The yield of coke and aromatics
was significantly higher in the in-situ method. Furthermore, hydrogen,
compared  to  helium,  increased  the  produced  light  olefin  by  a  few
percent  for  otherwise  comparative  reaction  conditions,  and  the  coke
yield  decreased  significantly.  However,  the  produced  aromatics  were
similar under helium and hydrogen atmosphere.

In  ex-situ  mode,  the  optimal  conditions  for  each  reactor  and  feed
combination are different and need to be obtained by careful optimi-
zation. This issue is important because plastic wastes are degraded by
various mechanical, thermal, optical, UV stresses, etc. [246]. To achieve
a suitable input for the catalytic reactor in an ex-situ upgrading config-
uration, the process parameters in the thermal reactor should be opti-
mized to yield products with molecular weight as low as possible except
for methane and minimal content of olefins and cyclic compounds [124,
138]. Over time, the double bonds and oxygenated components in the
polymer structure increase, visible also as the yellowish color of aged
plastics. In other words, an aged plastic feed has a lower H/C ratio than
virgin plastics and thus is more prone to further degradation and aro-
matic and coke production [247,248].

3.3. Zeolite and zeotype topology

The size, shape, and tortuosity of zeolite micropores are crucial pa-
rameters  of  zeolite  catalysts  determining  their  performance  [249].  In
general,  under  the  same  conditions,  the  application  of  8  and  10  MR
zeolites increases gas yield, while the application of 12 MR and meso-
porous catalysts leads to a high yield of liquid products [250,251].

Table  6  lists  some  examples  of  potential  zeolites  with  suitable
porosity for the production of light olefins from plastics. Because cata-
lysts with 12 MR pores were not effective in producing light olefins, only
zeolites that have 8 or 10 MR and pore sizes between 3.5 and 5.6 Å were
included  in  Table  6  [243,252–255].  The  pore  size  of  ZSM-5  can
accommodate aromatics, and for instance, Ga/ZSM-5 catalyst is known
for  its  high  selectivity  towards  aromatics.  If  only  the  pore  size  is

considered for otherwise the same parameters such as acidity and tem-
perature, ZSM-5 produces the most aromatics among the available cat-
alysts [256], which can be at the expense of forming light olefins. On the
other hand, catalysts like SAPO-34 with 8 MR pores of 3.8 Å were less
active  and  less  stable  than  ZSM-5  in  light  olefin  production  from  a
naphtha  feed  [257].  A  suitable  catalyst  needs  to  have  small  enough
pores to be able to produce short-chain olefins, but on the other hand, it
also needs to be able to allow access of the bulky feedstock to active
sites. Studies have shown that for HDPE in situ catalytic pyrolysis, most
of the degradation occurs on the ZSM-5 catalyst surface. In these cases,
the  catalyst  surface  is  covered  with  high  molecular  weight  aliphatic
coke, and the access to pores is blocked in the early stages of pyrolysis
[258–260].

◦

◦

To  date,  the  reported  results  have  primarily  focused  on  the  com-
parison  between  ZSM-5  with  other  zeolites.  Compared  to  many  com-
mercial  zeolites,  ZSM-5  has  superior  performance  in  light  olefin
production  from  heavy hydrocarbons  [257].  While for  low  molecular
weight feeds (C5-), catalysts with the pore size <4.0 Å perform better
than ZSM-5 [256]. As the molecular weight of the feedstock increases,
catalysts with pores of 4.5 to 5.6 Å, such as ZSM-5 [147], ZSM-22 [253],
ZSM-23  [255],  SAPO-11  [252],  ITQ-13  [252]  show  superior  perfor-
mance  in  light  olefin  production  [269].  Onwudili  et  al.  [147]  have
◦
compared the catalytic cracking (at 500–600
C) of vapors derived from
thermal  pyrolysis  (at  500
C)  of  a  simulated  mixed  plastics  sample
comprised of PE (62.0 wt.%: HDPE 19.0 wt.% and LDPE 43.0 wt.%), PP
(8.0 wt.%), PS (15.0 wt.%) and PET (15.0 wt.%). At a catalyst temper-
ature of 500
C, the highest gas yield (~25 wt.%) was obtained with a
high-Al  containing  Y-Zeolite,  while  at  600
C,  ZSM-5  with  Si/Al~80
achieved the highest gas yield (~52 wt.%) amongst the tested catalysts.
The highest selectivity to propylene was obtained at 500
C using the
spent FCC catalyst and ZSM-5. Muhammad et al. [270] reported that for
the  same  reactor  configuration,  higher  activity  and  higher  gas  yields
were obtained when cracking plastic pyrolysis vapors (500
C) derived
from  electrical  and  electronic  equipment  over  the  high-Al  containing
Y-Zeolite (Si/Al ~5) compared to ZSM-5 (Si/Al~40) at a catalyst tem-
◦
perature of 500
C. It seems that at the lower temperatures, the acidity is
more important for cracking than pore size.
The thermal pyrolysis of HDPE at 500

C and HZSM-5 catalytic py-
rolysis  of  the  generated  waxes  at  550
C  resulted  in  maximum  light
olefins production (63 wt.%) with high propylene yield (above 35 wt.%)
[124,139]. Besides high light olefin production, another advantage of
using HZSM-5 is its slower deactivation compared to HY and Hβ. The
shape  selectivity  of  HZSM-5  minimizes  coke  deposition  by  sterically
hindering the formation of polyaromatic structures from coke precursors
[226,271,272].

Introducing mesopores increases the accessibility of macromolecules
to the micropores located in the center of zeolite crystals, which may
otherwise  be  unutilized  due  to  diffusion  limitations.  In  addition,  the
mesoporosity ensures the fast leaving of products, thereby decreasing
the  “effective  residence  time”  in  the  catalyst  particle  (Fig.  17).  As
mentioned  previously,  a  high  residence  time  of  light  olefins  in  the
catalyst particles can lead to secondary reactions such as isomerization,
Diels-Alder,  and  coke  formation  [273–276].  Recent  studies  in  light
olefin production have focused on the development and application of
hierarchical zeolites.  These catalysts are composed  of bimodal micro-
porous–mesoporous  matrices  with  enhanced  accessibility,  making
readily available the advantages of both types of structures [274–276].
Eschenbacher et al. [277] investigated the effect of FCC-type catalysts
with  HZSM-5  additives  on  the  pyrolysis  of  waste  polyolefins  using  a
micropyrolysis reactor. The results showed that the prepared catalytic
matrices had a high potential to produce light olefins (60–70 wt.%) with
high  propylene  yield  (up  to  31  wt.%).  The  mesopores  formed  by
agglomerating the zeolite with bentonite and alumina favor the diffu-
sion of coke precursors toward the outside of the particle, thus avoiding
the blockage of the external micropores of the zeolite [139].

Canos et al. [278] investigated the effect of meso‐ZSM-22 and ZSM-5

been  reported  slightly  less  for  ZSM-5  (0.6–1.2  wt.%)  than  for
mezo-ZSM-22  (0.7–1.3  wt.%).  These  results  encourage  future  studies
testing ZSM-22 for upgrading polyolefin-derived pyrolysis vapors.

Chen et al. [252] pyrolyzed a hydrocarbons mixture of alpha-olefins
(50.4  wt.%),  paraffins  (38.1  wt.%),  and  aromatics  (11.5  wt.%)  using

earth/SAPO-11 converted more hydrocarbons compared to ZSM-5 (44.9
vs.40.1 wt.%). In addition, rare earth/SAPO-11 produced more ethylene
(5.1 vs. 4.7 wt.%) and propylene (24.4 vs. 19.8 wt.%), while ZSM-5 was
slightly better at butylene production (12.5 vs.11.8 wt.%).

Generally,  most  zeolites  with  a  suitable  pore  size  (3.5–5.6  Å)  can
produce light olefins through effective mechanisms and optimum pro-
cess parameters. This may require different catalyst/feed ratios and gas/
vapor-catalyst  contact  times  depending  on  the  zeolite  structure,  pore
size, and accessibility. Krannila et al. [279] have found that the ratio of
monomolecular/bimolecular  reactions  increases  with  higher  tempera-
tures and smaller pore sizes. The shape, design, and cages of the catalyst
structure are also critical in coke deposition and production. It is note-
worthy that coke deposition inside the catalyst pores reduces the cata-
lyst  pore  size,  which  may  result  in  lower  molecular  weight  products
based on diffusion restrictions [280]. However, this requires that suffi-
cient activity remains.

3.4. Catalyst particle size

The ratio of surface area to pore volume (S/V) is one of the key pa-
rameters for the catalysts used in pyrolysis, and an increase in the S/V
ratio  results  in  easier  access  of  heavy  feeds  to  active  sites,  which  is
especially relevant for the in-situ mode in which polymer melt wets the
catalyst  surface  prior  to  thermal  decomposition.  Reducing  the  size  of
catalyst particles towards nanocatalysts is one of the suitable strategies
for achieving the targeted high S/V. Commercial zeolites such as HZSM-
5, Hβ, HUSY, and HMOR, etc., in nanocrystalline form, have been used
in  the  pyrolysis  of  polyolefins  [281].  Nanocatalysts  show  additional
unique  properties  compared  to  microcatalysts,  such  as  lower  process
energy  consumption  in  catalyst  regeneration,  longer  lifecycle  via
decreased deactivation rates, and enhanced ease in coke combustion and
reusing  the  active  nanocatalysts  [282].  The  high  possibility  of  coke
formation close to the external surface of the catalyst particles can result
in rapid blocking of pore mouth entries, making the pore volume inside
the  crystal  inaccessible,  hence  shortening  the  catalyst  lifetime.
Nano-zeolites  decrease  the  diffusion  length  for  reactant/product  hy-
drocarbons and the residence time (inside the catalyst particle) [283,
284].

The  effect  of  ZSM-5  particle  size  on  the  catalytic  stability  was
demonstrated for the application of n-hexane cracking [284]. While the
initial conversion was similar for different crystal sizes (~ 94 wt.%), the
highest C2–C3 olefins yield was obtained using nano-ZSM-5 with a P/E
ratio of 1.57. In addition, the conversion gradually decreased to 48 wt.%
after  50  h  over  micro-ZSM-5,  while  nano  and  medium  size  of  ZSM-5
maintained  high  conversions  at  82  and  81  wt.%,  respectively.  In
conclusion, the benefit of catalyst particle size may not be visible during
the initial upgrading period, but smaller particle sizes tend to achieve a
long  time  on  stream,  which  brings  process  advantages  since  the  fre-
quency of catalyst regeneration and the associated process downtime is
reduced.

The applied reactor technology is also a determining factor for the
employed catalyst particle size. Fluidized bed reactors are popular for
the  in-situ  catalytic  pyrolysis  of  solid  plastic  waste  [236,242].  When
fluidizing a catalyst bed, the catalyst particle distribution is essential for
the  fluidization  regime  of  the  bed.  If  the  particles  are  too  small  for
fluidization, particle blow out is a risk; on the other hand, when particles
are too big the bed remains a fixed bed [285]. The higher the slip ve-
locity achievable in the reactor, the smaller the catalyst particle can be
for  fluidization  [285].  As  nanoparticles  have  superior  reactive

catalysts  on  the  pyrolysis  of  C5–C7  olefins.  The  results  showed  that
under similar conditions and the same catalyst/feed ratios (0.75–1.49),
the conversion using ZSM-5 (86–91 wt.%) was slightly better than using
meso‐ZSM-22 (80–92 wt.%). However, using meso‐ZSM-22 (85–86 wt.
%) was more likely to produce light olefins than ZSM-5 (77–79 wt.%).
The produced propylene was 24–29 wt.% and 24–26 wt.% using mes-
o‐ZSM-22 and ZSM-5, respectively. More aromatics were produced in
the presence of ZSM-5 (4–6 wt.%), while meso‐ZSM-22 showed a lower
tendency to produce aromatics (~1 wt.%). The produced coke has also

properties, reactor technologies which ensure these high slip velocities
such as vortex reactors are favorable for catalytic pyrolysis. Moreover,
catalyst particle size is a dynamic property as catalyst attrition during
fluidization  results  in  a  decrease  of  the  particle  size.  Spouted  bed  re-
actors  achieve  lower  particle  velocities  than  bubble  fluidized  bed  re-
actors  resulting  in  lower  catalyst  attrition  for  the  spouted  bed  [236].
Additionally,  vortex  reactors  achieve  even  higher  particle  velocities
than typical fluidized bed reactors however their rate of particle attri-
tion was observed to be comparable [286]. The attrition rate is of course
not merely dependent on the applied reactor technology but also on the
mechanical strength of the particle. This mechanical strength is mainly
determined by the type of binder which is used for the catalyst particle
[287].  Therefore,  the  catalyst  binder  should  be  tuned  based  on  the
applied reactor technology to ensure a proper particle size distribution
[288].

3.5. Catalyst acidity

The acidity of zeolite catalysts (except for SAPOs) depends on their
Si/Al ratio, and higher Si/Al ratios generally result in lower total acidity
(involving a decrease in the density of active sites) [289]. The Si/Al ratio
in the zeolites can affect the position and distribution of negative charge
density, cages, pores, and the nature of different ligands [290]. Brønsted
acidity  comes  from  charge  balancing  by  protons  of  the  Al  negative
charge  generated  when  an  Al  atom  is  substituted  for  Si  atom  in  the
framework. Abdolrahmani et al. [291] indicated that both Brønsted and
Lewis  acid  sites  have  a  crucial  role  in  the  catalytic  cracking  of

hydrocarbons and polyolefins.

The effect of coke deactivation on catalyst acidity is well known. The
decrease  in  available  acid  sites  because  of  coke  deposition  decreases
secondary  reactions  and  polyaromatics  production  due  to  the  loss  in
activity. A lower acid site density reduces the rate of coke deposition, i.
e., the coking rate is often highest initially and then, after a steep initial
decrease in coking rate, decreases at a much slower rate [292–294].

Artetxe et al. [139] reported that the acidity (Si/Al~30, 80, and 280)
of the ZSM-5 catalyst could affect the light olefin production in ex-situ
mode  HDPE  pyrolysis, using  a low  catalyst/polymer ratio  (8 gcat  min
(cid:0) 1
gHDPE
). ZSM-5 with high acidity (Si/Al~30) produced higher yields of
light olefins than ZSM-5 with a high Si/Al ratio of 280 (58.0 vs. 35.5 wt.
%).  Also,  with  an  increase  in  catalyst  acidity,  propylene  production
(18.8–32.2 wt.%) increased significantly. However, for the in-situ mode
using a high ratio of catalyst/polymer (30 gcat min gHDPE
), the trend was
reversed, and the catalyst with lower acidity (Si/Al~80 vs. 30) showed
better performance in the production of light olefins (59.8 vs. 57.0 wt.
%). In addition, ZSM-5 with lower acidity produced slightly more pro-
pylene (29.0 vs. 28.0 wt.%).

(cid:0) 1

Fig. 18 shows the effect of the Si/Al ratio on LDPE degradation using
H-β catalyst in-situ contact mode. As seen, with decreasing Si/Al ratio, i.
e., higher acidity, LDPE degraded at lower temperatures. The effect of
acidity  on  catalyst  activity  was  quite  evident,  particularly  when
lowering the Si/Al ratio from 300 to 150, and therefore seems to be an
important parameter in determining the optimum pyrolysis temperature
to produce suitable hydrocarbons from polyolefins [295].

investigated the effect of boron and phosphorus-modified ZSM-5 cata-
lysts  on  the  light  olefins  production  when  using  virgin  and  mixed
polyolefins  as  the  feedstock.  The  modified  catalysts,  in  addition  to
maintaining  their  activity  for  a  longer  time  compared  to  the  parent
ZSM-5, resulted in the production of light olefins up to about 85 wt.%,
which  is  very  promising.  Table  7  shows  the  yields  obtained  with
C and a catalyst/feed
different feeds using P/ZSM-5 as catalyst at 600
ratio of 80 in ex-situ catalytic fast pyrolysis. Depending on the feedstock
structure, P/ZSM-5 catalyst showed different performances. The results
show that with increasing tertiary carbons in the feedstock, as is the case
for PP, the light olefin production is lower. Compared to using linear
polyethylenes as the feed (70.0 vs. 83.6 wt.%). The produced light olefin
from MPO, most of which is polyethylene, has increased compared to the
virgin  PP  (70.0  vs.73.2  wt.%).  Furthermore,  due  to  the  presence  of
double bonds in its structure and a small percentage of polystyrene, the
amount of aromatic production has increased significantly (4.1 vs. 9.0
wt.%).

3.7. Catalyst temperature

The temperature under which the catalyst operates is an important
property  for  both  its  activity,  selectivity,  and  stability.  With  catalytic
pyrolysis  (both  in-situ  as  ex-situ),  the  reaction  temperature  can  be
significantly  lowered  compared  to  thermal  pyrolysis.  Figs.  19  and  20
show  the  effect  of  catalyst  amount  and  catalyst  type  on  the  polymer
degradation  rate.  At  a  constant  heating  rate,  these  catalysts  promote
polymer cracking and degrade the polymer at lower temperatures than
thermal pyrolysis [295,299]. For zeolite catalysts, as the catalyst/pol-
ymer  ratio  increases,  the  polymer  degrades  at  lower  temperatures
(Fig. 19). The optimum temperature for maximum light olefins and/or
the  other  components  depends  on  both  the  catalyst  type  and  cata-
lyst/polymer  ratio  [299].  According  to  the  literature,  the  optimum
temperature  for  the  production  of  light  olefins  from  polyolefin  under
◦
thermal cracking conditions is above 800
C [130], whereas when using
an  active  catalyst,  it  is  between  500  and  700
C  [139,195,220],  and

ratios (adapted from [295]).

3.6. Catalyst promotion

Metal incorporation of zeolites can affect the production of upgraded
fuels and chemicals in the product stream. Extensive research is avail-
able in the literature on the modification of ZSM-5 using phosphoric acid
and metal oxides at different loadings [296]. However, these applica-
tions  primarily  concern  the  cracking  of  fossil-derived  liquids  and
biomass  pyrolysis  vapors,  and  limited  research  is  available  using
metal-modified zeolites for the upgrading of polyolefins.

Phosphorus impregnation can be an effective method to increase the
hydrothermal stability of zeolites. Initially, P/ZSM-5 has lower activity
than HZSM-5 in hydrocarbon cracking since the introduction of phos-
phorous has been shown to lead to a decrease in acidity compared to a
parent HZSM-5. However, after exposure to severe hydrothermal con-
ditions,  P/ZSM-5  retains  its  activity  longer  than  unmodified  HZSM-5
[296].

Boron  modification  was  reported  to  be  beneficial  for  light  olefin
production, with results by Zhou et al. [297] showing that fast catalytic
pyrolysis of LDPE over 1 wt.% B/ZSM-5, has increased the olefins yield
compared  to  parent  ZSM-5  (28  to  34  wt.%).  Also,  modification  with
fluorine was reported to enhance the production of light olefins when
using  light  naphtha  as  the  feedstock,  and  Rahimi  et  al.  [296]  have
◦
indicated that at 600
C, F/ZSM-5 increased the light olefin production
(50.9–63.5 wt.%) at the expense of BTX (25.5–21.8 wt.%) compared to
using the unmodified ZSM-5. Lastly, Wei et al. [298] have worked on the
naphtha catalytic cracking using different metal impregnated ZSM-5 at
650
C.  For  the  production  of  light  olefins,  P/ZSM-5  (63  wt.%),
P-La/ZSM-5 (60 wt.%), Sr/ZSM-5 (57.5 wt.%), and Cu/ZSM-5 (57 wt.
%), showed better performance than ZSM-5 (53 wt.%). These examples
indicate a clear potential for ZSM-5 promotion to enhance the produc-
tion of liquid olefins.

◦

This was recently confirmed by Eschenbacher et al. [195,220], who

[144].  At  these  higher  temperatures  the  propylene  and  butene  yields
decrease  similar  to  thermal  pyrolysis  as  these  are  overcracked  to
methane,  ethane  or  undergo  Diels-Alder  reactions  with  formation  of
aromatics  and  coke  [300].  The  optimum  ethylene  concentration  is
determined by thermal cracking reactions instead of catalytic cracking
C similar to thermal pyrol-
reactions reaching an optimum above 800
ysis [142,144].

◦
At temperatures above 650

C the fraction of methane, aromatics and
coke increases rapidly hampering the stability of the catalyst [195]. The
catalyst and feedstock type are important variables which determine at
which  temperature  or  residence  time  optimal  yields  are  situated.
Therefore,  it  is  important  to  investigate  these  reaction  conditions
whenever employing a new catalyst for the catalytic pyrolysis of plastic
waste [244].

◦

Fig.  22  shows  a  comparison  between  the  gaseous  reaction  yields
between  thermal  pyrolysis  and  catalytic  pyrolysis.  Hern ́andez  et  al.
investigated both the thermal and in-situ catalytic pyrolysis of HDPE in a
fluidized bed reactor [144]. A comparison between HUSY and HZSM-5
was  made  to  indicate  the  effect  of  different  catalysts  on  the  reaction
yields. All experiments were performed to full conversion, with a cata-
lyst/feed ratio of 25:1. From Fig. 22 it can be deduced that the effect of
temperature is less pronounced with catalytic pyrolysis than with ther-
mal  pyrolysis.  Overall,  the  gaseous  yields of  HZSM-5  are  higher  than
those of HUSY due to the stronger acidity which enhances the cracking
activity of the former zeolite. The zeolites promoted the selectivity to-
wards propylene and butene due to their shape selectivity, which is in
agreement  with  literature.  While the  gas  yields  tend  to  increase  with
increasing  temperature,  these  stagnate  and  decrease  for  catalytic  py-
◦
rolysis at temperatures above 650
C. This decrease is a consequence of
catalyst deactivation due to dealumination of the zeolite and coking as
argued by Marcilla et al. [301,302]. The increase in coking rate can also
be seen from Fig. 22(d) by the decrease of aromatics. These aromatics
serve as a  precursor for coke, with the decrease in aromatics being a
consequence of the elevated coking rate.

3.8. Decontamination of the feed

One of the most important problems in the field of catalytic pyrolysis
of plastic waste is that the feedstock contains different polymer additives
such  as  metallic  pigments  [303,304],  calcium  carbonate  [305],  talc
[306],  kaolin  [307],  glass  fibers  [308],  carbon  black  [309],  metal
stearates  [310],  antioxidant  [311]  and  other  organic  additives  [312,
313].  Mainly  in  the  case  of  in-situ  catalytic  pyrolysis,  where  there  is
direct contact between the raw feedstock and the catalyst, the presence
of these additives poses a problem as they contaminate the catalyst and
rapidly  deactivate  the  active  sites  [26,33].  A  loss  in  activity  due  to
poisoning by inorganics may in this case, be compensated by increasing

maybe even lower at high catalyst/polymer ratios. As a result, in order
to achieve a similar conversion for a fixed reactor temperature, different
catalyst/polymer  ratios  are  required  depending  on  the  activity  of  the
catalyst [295,299].

◦

Next  to  the  activity,  the  catalyst  temperature  is  also  important  to
steer the selectivity and product distribution. Orozco et al. investigated
the effect of temperature for the in-situ catalytic pyrolysis of HDPE in a
conical spouted bed with a spent FCC catalyst [240]. At temperatures
below 475
C, the main obtained products were waxes with a carbon
chain  length  larger  than  nineteen  as  depicted  in  Fig.  21.  When
◦
C, hardly any waxes were observed
increasing this temperature to 500
and  the  main  product  were  C5–C11  liquid-range  hydrocarbons.  The
selectivity  at  temperatures  above  550
C  shifted  more  to
gaseous products while the share of liquids decreased. As the primary
cracking  reactions  in  the  catalytic  pyrolysis  are  endothermic,  a  tem-
perature  increase  results  in  an  increased  thermodynamic  and  kinetic
driving  force  for  these  reactions  [300].  At  temperatures  around
550–650
C,  a  maximum  selectivity  towards  light  olefins  is  observed
[240,244].  Within  this  temperature  range,  the  primary  cracking  re-
actions  are  sufficiently  promoted  while  monomolecular  cracking  of
propylene and butenes is still limited. This results in an increase of the
share of light olefins as illustrated in Fig. 21. Moreover, from tempera-
◦
tures around 600
C and higher, the ratio of ethylene over propylene and
ethylene over butene tends to increase compared to lower temperatures

C  and  600

the catalyst/plastic ratios to obtain acceptable conversion levels, but this
is undesirable and not viable for continuous industrial operation [312].
In both thermal pyrolysis and ex-situ catalytic pyrolysis (see Section 3.2),
inorganic  additives  or  impurities  are  separated  out  in  the  first  stage,
where  thermal  cracking  of  the  polymer  melt  takes  place.  Only  in  the
second  stage  of  ex-situ  catalytic  pyrolysis  the  volatilized  thermal  py-
rolysis  products  come  into  contact  with  the  catalyst  [139,173].
Furthermore, the presence of (in)organic additives and impurities can
also influence the chemistry during the thermal cracking of the polymer
melt, and organic impurities with various heteroatoms (N, S, O, Cl, Br)
that can poison the catalyst are part of the volatized thermal pyrolysis
products  [42–44,314].  For  example,  anti-oxidants  and  stabilizers  are
added to the plastics to avoid degradation during its lifetime and me-
chanical  recycling.  Those  additives  are  designed  to  scavenge  radicals
and avoid radical chemistry to take place. As a result, it is expected that
they will have a significant influence on the pyrolysis of plastic waste
[315].  Hence,  reducing  the  number  of  additives  and  impurities  to  a
minimum is essential for industrial applications.

The dissolution of plastics in different solvents followed by drying
and  (catalytic)  pyrolysis  is  often  done  to  remove  contaminants  [316,
317]. In this case, the polyolefins are first dissolved in strong solvents
such  as  toluene  at  high  temperatures  which  dissolves  the  targeted
polymer leaving the contaminants in the residue. To separate out the
mineral contaminants, an anti-solvent e.g., methanol or hexane is used,
which dissolves the metals but not the polymer [318–320]. Afterwards,
the polymer is recovered from the solution via drying or the polymer is
precipitated  with  an  anti-solvent  [321].  The  dissolution  process  is
currently  in  its  research  stages  and  requires  further  investigation  to
reduce process costs.

One of the most versatile and robust decontamination strategies is
the hydrotreatment of plastic waste. Common heteroatoms like (N, S, O,
Cl,  Br)  can  be  removed  via  various  hydrotreatments.  The  removal  of
nitrogen and sulfur via hydrotreatment is a commonly applied purifi-
cation process within the petrochemical industry for the decontamina-
tion of fuels or crude fractions [177,322]. The removal of oxygen and

halogens can be achieved in similar fashion, however for halogens care
should  be  taken  as  the  formed  halogen  hydrides  are  corrosive  and
therefore require a proper reactor material selection. The major disad-
vantage of hydrotreating plastic waste melts is the cost of the required
hydrogen. Hydrogenating processes are an expensive decontamination
strategy  and  with the  increasing  demand  for hydrogen  this  is  not ex-
pected  to  alter  [323].  However,  these  processes  are  very  robust  and
versatile as they can handle a wide variety of feeds and remove many
different types of contaminants with one process. Hydrotreatments are
widely  applied  processes  within  the  petrochemical  industry  and  are
mature  technology  making  them  a  suitable  option  for  current  plastic
waste treatment plants.

Next  to  hydrotreatments,  dehalogenation  via  catalytic  hydrotreat-
ment is another purification strategy possible for the removal of halo-
gens of plastic waste [324]. By using iron oxide catalysts chloroorganic
compounds can be removed while maintaining a stable catalyst [324].
The main contaminant causing the presence of halogens in the plastic
waste is of course the presence PVC. Therefore, a careful separation of
PVC  from  the  other  polyolefin  waste,  via  e.g.  density  separation,  is
crucial for limiting the halogen concentration in the stream [32].

Plastics have a wide application range and during their lifetime the
polymers come into contact with a variety of contaminants. Therefore,
various metals  have also  been  detected  in plastic waste pyrolysis  oils
[42].  Reacting  metals  with  acids  such  as  sulfuric  acid  are  a  common
industrial strategy to remove these metals. Other strategies consist of
hydrodemetallization which is a catalytic process which hydrogenates
the metal salt and precipitates this salt in the catalyst [325]. Aluminum
oxide  and  aluminum  silicate  are  found to  be active  materials  for this
process. Similar strategies can also be applied for the removal of other
heteroatoms such as nitrogen, sulfur, and oxygen.

Hydrotreatment  and  catalytic  hydrotreatment  for  the  removal  of
heteroatoms,  among  which  halogens  and  metals,  are  both  mature
technology  which  is  currently  applied  for  the  decontamination  of
several hydrocarbon streams. However, these processes have only been
applied in a research context for the purification of plastic waste feeds.

As plastic waste is a more viscous mixture and limits mass transfer in
general  of  these  processes,  a  further  investigation  of  these  effects  is
required  before  these  can  be  fully  commercialized.  Moreover,  all
mentioned processes require expensive solvents (dissolution), reactants
(hydrotreatment),  or  catalysts  (catalytic  hydroprocessing)  such  that  a
technical and economical analysis is required to select the most feasible
strategy.

4. Reactors with industrial potential

Researchers  have  employed  many  reactor  types  in  the  pyrolysis
process, but a reactor that excels in all aspects is challenging to realize.
An ideal reactor for the production of light olefins needs to be able to
operate at a high processing temperature with minimum temperature
gradient  and  ensure  efficient  heat  transfer,  proper  mixing,  short  resi-
dence  time  (while  achieving  complete  conversion),  low  energy  con-
sumption,  high  resistance  against  corrosion  and  allow  optimal  mass
transfer and contact between catalyst and feed [32,286,326].

Based on literature, fluidized bed, conical spouted bed, microwave
assisted reactors, downers, and vortex reactors are considered the most
promising reactor types to be considered for the industrialization of light
olefins production.

4.1. Downer reactor

A co-current down-flow circulating fluidized bed (downer) reactor,
in which gas, catalyst, and feedstock are fed from the top of the reactor
flowing downward, has been developed in the last two decades (Fig. 23)
[327]. A short residence time (less than 1 s) with narrow residence time
distribution, good heat and mass transfer, uniform radial flow patterns,
and less solid and gas back-mixing (compared to riser or fluid bed re-
actors) are advantages of the downer reactor [328,329]. These reactor

properties allow to minimize the contact time between the catalyst and
the hydrocarbons, which is essential for obtaining high olefin yields in
catalytic pyrolysis. The development of a proper downer reactor poses
some  challenges  for  the  feeding  and  fast  separation  of  the  products
[327].  Due  to  the  short  residence  time,  a  proper  mixing  of  the  solid
catalyst-gas feed is crucial for an optimal performance of the downer.
Additionally,  in  catalytic  processes  a  short  contact  time  between  the
catalyst and plastic requires a fast separation of the solid catalyst and the
gaseous products at the outlet. The main difference between this type of
reactor and other reactors that are proposed for plastic pyrolysis is that it
approximates  plug  flow  behavior  while  maintaining  a  high  heat  and
mass  transfer  [327].  This  type  of  reactor  has  been  applied  to  many
gas-solid processes in research, including the catalytic cracking of heavy
crude oil to light olefins [329,330] and pyrolysis of biomass [331] and
plastics [332]. The downer reactor is thus suited for both the thermal
pyrolysis  as  for  the  catalytic  pyrolysis  of  plastic  waste.  The  downer
catalytic pyrolysis process is proposed for light olefin production, which
is characterized by the adoption of downer reactor and the exploitation
of  both  the  thermal  effect  and  the  catalytic  effect.  The  experimental
results show that the process can bring out high yields of light olefins
and stable liquid products, while the dry gas and coke are suppressed
[329].  Makkawi  et  al.  performed  a  computational  analysis  of  the
important  process  conditions  for  the  biomass  pyrolysis  in  a  downer
reactor [331]. It was found that the reactor temperature, and carrier gas
flow rate are the main variables that influence the product yields. The
effect of the biomass particle size on the product yields was found to be
negligible at the studied reaction conditions. Experimental studies for
the  pyrolysis of either biomass or plastics  are limited, which is  detri-
mental for the industrialization of this promising reactor configuration.

4.2. Fluidized bed reactor

Given the sticky nature and low thermal conductivity of polyolefins,
a suitable reactor with high heat and a mass transfer would be ideal for
minimizing  the  physical  limitations  [333–335].  Fluidized  beds  are
typically  used  for  fluid  catalytic  cracking,  polymerization  of  olefins,
gasification,  and  other  catalytic  processes  [336].  These  processes  are
characterized by either a high endo- or exothermicity or the presence of
a catalyst, which require a reactor with a high heat and/or mass transfer.
Also for the pyrolysis of polyolefins, fluidized beds are a popular reactor
configuration in research  [38,108,337]. This type of gas-solid reactor
facilitates both the thermal pyrolysis as well as the in-situ catalytic py-
rolysis of plastics. Moreover, fluidized bed reactors are already widely
used at an industrial scale, making the envisaged scale-up easier [296,
338,339].  High  heat  transfer  rates  allow  operating  under  isothermal
conditions. Moreover, the short residence time of volatiles in the reactor
limits  the  formation  of  undesired  by-products,  such  as  methane  and
polyaromatics  [339].  Park  et  al.  [340]  have  recently  developed  a
two-stage pyrolysis process using an auger and a FB reactor. In the auger
reactor, at moderate reaction temperatures, the initial degradation oc-
curs, and the feed is pre-heated for the second reactor. In the fluidized
bed reactor, under fast pyrolysis and high reaction temperature, the feed
is thermally cracked as soon as entering the reactor.

When operating a fluidized bed reactor it is essential to have a proper
control of the carrier gas velocity. Depending on the particle size dis-
tribution, particle density, and the carrier gas velocity different fluid-
ization  regimes  can  be  obtained,  e.g.,  bubble  flow,  slug  flow,  or
turbulent fluidization [285,341]. A risk during the pyrolysis of plastic
waste, is the agglomeration of the polymer particle which can result in
the defluidization of the bed [236,342]. Due to the sticky viscous nature
of the coated polymer particles, these particles can stick to one another
and  agglomerate  to  form  large  polymer  aggregates.  Agglomeration  is
promoted by the existence of badly fluidized areas within the reactor,
and a high plastic hold-up in the bed [342]. The risk of a non-uniform
fluidization  and  too  large  plastic  hold-up  increase  with  scale-up.
Therefore,  when  industrializing  fluidized  bed  reactors  it  is  crucial  to

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience96(2023)10104623

M.S. Abbas-Abadi et al.

account for the risk of particle agglomeration.

Catalyst  attrition  is  another  important  factor  to  consider  for  the
stability of the fluidized bed [343,344]. When employing fluidized beds
for catalytic processes, these particles collide with the reactor wall and
with other catalyst particles. This causes the particles to slowly erode
and causes the loss of active catalyst and generation of fines. During the
catalytic pyrolysis of plastics this is an extra limitation for the stability of
the  catalyst  particle.  Therefore,  the  support  of  the  catalyst  particle
should be carefully chosen as this determines the mechanical strength of
the catalyst and its attrition rate [288]. Fluidized bed reactors provide
excellent properties such as high heat and mass transfer, and short gas
residence times, which are all essential for industrializing the pyrolysis
of polyolefin waste. Despite the maturity of this reactor technology and
their popularity in experimental research, a few hurdles remain. These
are the control of the fluidization regime, the prevention of agglomer-
ation, and the catalyst attrition rate.

4.3. Microwave assisted pyrolysis reactor

Microwave assisted pyrolysis reactors are a promising alternative to
other conventional pyrolysis technologies. Benefits are selective heating
(e.g., suitable for removing HCl of PVC from the thermal decomposition
of mixed plastics), energy savings by achieving faster heating rates, and
shorter residence times. Furthermore, dispersed microwave absorbents,
which are heated directly by microwave irradiation at a very high rate,
act  as  a  localized  heating  source  to  the  surrounding  feedstock,  and
therefore greatly improve the uniformity and rates of the heating pro-
cess.  In  contrast,  the  sticky  nature  and  low  thermal  conductivity  of
melted plastics often seriously limit the heat transfer in a conventional
heating  process  [68,245,163].  Microwave  power  [345],  temperature
[161],  the  type  of  plastic  (dielectric  properties)  [346],  absorber  type
[162], microwave design [347], reactor design [68], and catalyst [348]
are  influencing  parameters  in  microwave  assisted  pyrolysis  of  plastic
wastes.

Zhou et al. [245] performed a continuous ex-situ pyrolysis of HDPE
using a microwave assisted pyrolysis reactor. The temperature of cata-
lyst  and  HDPE  vapors  was  400  and  620
C  respectively.  During  the
one-hour  experimental  run,  the  gas  yields  decreased  from  57.8%  to
40.2%, and the liquid yield increased to 56.9%. Light olefins accounted
for between 20 and 25 wt.% of the total pyrolytic products. The applied
catalyst with high acidity and low bed temperature was suitable for fuel
production with high aromatics (up to 52% in liquid).

◦

The residence time of the microwave assisted pyrolysis reactor was
roughly estimated to be around 90 s at the processing temperature of
◦
500
C and should be lower at high temperatures to produce light olefins
[245]. For comparison, the residence time in a batch reactor is typically
over  20  min,  fluidized  bed  reactor,  conical  spouted  bed,  and  vortex
reactor  it  is  in  the  order  of  10,  1,  and  0.1  s  respectively  [337,339,
348–350].

Despite the advantageous properties of microwave assisted reactors
such  as  energy  savings,  and  fast  heating  rates,  they  lack  industrial
applicability. The scale-up of these microwave reactors for plastic waste
pyrolysis  is  very  challenging  as  the  penetration  depth  is  only  a  few
centimeters in usual solvents, and even smaller for plastic waste [164].
This  is  far  from  the  scale  required  for  industrial  application  and
currently prevents the usage of these microwave-assisted reactors.

4.4. Conical spouted bed reactor (CSBR)

The  CSBR  is  a  suitable  alternative  to  a  conventional  gravitational
fluidized  bed  reactor.  The  CSBR  has  particular  benefits  related  to
improved heat and mass transfer, versatility in particle sizes, and an easy
reactor  design  (without  a  distributor  plate).  Furthermore,  the  hydro-
dynamics of the CSBR enhances heat and mass transfer between phases.
The cyclic movement of the particles means a counter-current flow of
the solid (upward in the spout and downward in the annulus). The gas

flows  upward  through  the  spout,  whereas  the  solid  flows  downward
through the annulus. The high inert gas (N2) flow rate contributes to
increasing heat and mass transfer and short residence times of the vol-
atile stream, therefore minimizing secondary reactions [123]. Moreover,
spouted  bed  reactors  provide  a  more  stable  reactor  performance
compared  to  conventional  fluidized  bed  reactors  [236].  Spouted  bed
reactors are less prone to agglomeration due to a more uniform distri-
bution of the plastic melt over the solid particles. The cyclic movement
of the solids in the spouted bed ensures an optimal coating and the solid
flow  prevents  the  agglomeration.  Additionally,  catalyst  attrition  in  a
spouted bed reactor can be limited by adding a fountain confiner and
incorporating an open sided draft tube [351].

Prof. Olazar group from University of the Basque Country, Spain has
released several papers on light olefin production using conical spouted
bed reactor. Simple design, short residence time (in the order of centi-
seconds), effective contact between catalyst and feedstock in addition
to the high yield of light olefins and the minimal coke formation are the
advantages of the applied CSBR [123,124,139,258,352].

Since  the  catalytic  pyrolysis  will  require  periodic  or  continuous
regeneration  of  the  catalyst  by  combusting  coke  deposits,  one  can
envision operating two integrated conical spouted bed reactors for cat-
alytic  pyrolysis  and  catalyst  regeneration,  respectively  (see  Fig.  24).
Dual-bed technology is efficient due to the extremely high surface area
between fluidization gas and solid and the high levels of intermixing of
the different phases and materials [353,354]. In the pyrolysis reactor
this  ensures  optimal  contact  between  the  catalyst  and  polymer  melt,
while in the regenerator the formed coke can be quickly burned of by
mixing  the  deactivated  catalyst  and  the  oxidizing  gas.  Combining
combustion  and  pyrolysis  in  one  plant  comprising  two  dual  conical
spouted bed reactors and a bed material that acts as a heat exchanger
would give the possibility to produce the thermal energy needed for the
endothermic  cracking  process  and  the  resulting  fuels  with  just  one
feedstock  (Fig.  24).  This  type  of  dual  bed  process  is  similar  to  the
industrially  applied  FCC.  However,  in  catalytic  pyrolysis  less  coke  is
formed  (<1  wt.%)  than  in  a  conventional  FCC-unit  (5–10  wt.%)
resulting in a lower heat production in the regenerator. Therefore, extra
heating of the pyrolysis reactor is likely to be required in a continuous
operation.  The  dual  fluidized  bed  processes  are  well  established  and

investigated  for  gasification  purposes.  The  novel  approach  here  is  to
◦
operate one reactor at a lower temperature of about 400–700
C to gain
a gaseous product at a moderated temperature. Avoiding condensation
of higher hydrocarbons gives a product gas, which can be separated into
light olefins and flue gasses with elevated heating value as well as ideal
properties for co-firing [354].

4.5. Vortex reactor

A more advanced and innovative reactor type is the static or rotating
gas-solid vortex reactor (GSVR), which operates in a centrifugal force
field, further improving the heat and mass transfer rates compared to
CSBRs. As a consequence, much smaller reactors can be used that allow
improved operational control [355]. Reactors with reduced size create
additional opportunities, such as more straightforward electrification of
the  process  by  electric  heating  via  induction  through  the  entire  steel
reactor block (Fig. 25). The vortex reactor consists of a rotating bed in a
static  cylindrical  chamber  under  high-velocity  gas  injection  via
tangentially  inclined  inlet  slots.  The  rotation  of  solid  particles  in  the
chamber transfers momentum from inlet gas to the solid particles and
creates a high centrifugal acceleration, up to twice the acceleration of
the Earth’s gravity. The radially outward centrifugal force compensates
for  the  radially  inward  drag  force  exerted  by  the  gas  that  leaves  the
chamber via a central outlet. As a consequence of the high centrifugal
forces  on  the  solid  particles  not  every  type  of  catalyst  particle  is
well-suited  for  this  type  of  vortex  reactor,  as  catalyst  attrition  could
destroy the catalyst [288]. Due to the high particle velocities, friction
with the vortex wall and other particles results in an increased wear of
the catalyst, similar to what is observed in other fluidized beds [356].
The  mechanical  strength  of  the  catalyst  depends  mainly  on  the
employed  binder,  which  can  be  improved  to  limit  catalyst  attrition
[288].

In  comparison  with  fluidized  bed  reactors,  denser  solid  beds  and
higher gas-solid slip velocities result in higher heat and mass transfer
and shorter residence times (on the order of milliseconds) in GSVR. The
very short residence time in a vortex reactor results in attenuation of
secondary reactions and, in addition to slowing down the deactivation
rate of the catalyst used (low coke formation), leads to a high yield of
light olefins [150,358,357].

5. Towards full recyclability of polyolefins

5.1. Scale-up versus numbering up

The petrochemical industry employs a staged trajectory to de-risk a
project: bench, pilot, semi-works, and commercial, respectively, which
entails increasing investments and which can, at best, remove technical
risk  (market  risks,  competitive  risks,  timing  risks  all  remain).  In  this

regard,  scaling-up  beats  numbering  up  if  initial  costs  are  identical.
However, pre-commercial costs for large plants are often much higher
than  for  small  plants,  yielding  a  cross-over  in  enterprise  costs.  The
extension of facilities for chemical and petrochemical projects usually
benefits from economies of scaling, typically according to an allometric
relation in which the fixed capital investment increases with production
scale raised to a power, n, where 1 > n ≈ 0.7 (Fig. 26).

By varying the parameters in sequence, it is found that the cross-over
scale  is  most  sensitive  to  the  scaling  exponent,  the  learning  rate  for
numbering up, the capacity cost of the stick-built facility, and the fixed
(non-labor) cost of the modular facility. It is much less sensitive to the
upfront costs of research and tooling (Fig. 27) [359]. Fig. 28 shows that
the  cost  of  a  produced  unit,  whether  it  is  a  service,  a  material,  or  a
widget, is generally found to decrease with more experience by up to 10
times [360].

5.2. Life cycle assessment (LCA)

Over the past few decades, to evaluate the environmental impacts of
different materials and chemical processes cycles life cycle assessment
(LCA) has been used as a critical method. The LCA approach provides a
methodology for evaluating and analyzing the strengths and weaknesses
of waste management systems and strategies such as landfill, incinera-
tion,  and  mechanical  and  chemical  recycling  from  the  environmental
side.  LCA  programs  have  been  carried  out  in  different  countries  to
manage different  waste types, make  decisions, and  strategic planning

Fig.  26. Comparison  of  the  incremental  costs  via  scaling-  and  numbering-up

recycling. Waste polyolefins with a CO2-eq of 0.9–1.1 kg per kg emit the
lowest GHG during light olefin production, less than secondary and even
primary  recycling  alternatives,  which  challenges  the  conventional
recycling hierarchy. Depending on the final product, from wax to light
olefins, the greenhouse gas emissions vary greatly [371].

Eschenbacher et al. [195] performed a life cycle assessment based on
the cut-off system model [372] focusing on the process carbon footprint
for light olefin production from plastic waste, taking high-value chem-
icals (HVC) as the functional unit. The electricity and heat demand were
considered as background process with values taken from the ecoinvent
v3.6  database  [373].  The  foreground  process  consisted  of  the  actual
chemical  recycling  process  (pyrolysis  + steam  cracking  vs.  catalytic
pyrolysis), with product yields assumed equal to lab scale results. The
results  showed  that  the  conventional  process  (pyrolysis  + steam
cracking)  resulted  in  more  carbon  footprint  than  catalytic  pyrolysis
(0.91 kg CO2-eq./kgHVC  vs. 0.57 kg CO2-eq./kgHVC). Furthermore, the
studied catalytic process constitutes a sustainable alternative process for
plastic waste valorization since it leads to about an order of magnitude
(0.3 versus 3.1 kg CO2-eq./kgplastics) lower environmental burden than
the current practice of incineration.

Therefore, the quality of waste polymers (mixed source, mixed ma-
terials)  and  suitable  pretreatment  methods  for  decontamination,  in
addition to optimized pyrolysis process parameters, affect the environ-
mental  performance  of  recycling.  The  optimization  of  waste  sorting,
decontamination,  and  pyrolysis  parameters  does  not  alter  the  perfor-
mance  ranking  of  the  technologies.  However,  a  large  GHG  reduction
potential  is  available  by  improving  recycling.  By  executing  recycling
(and sorting) of the most demanded polymers in Europe, life cycle CO2
emissions from plastics can be reduced by 73 wt.% or 200 Mt CO2-eq
annually [371].

In addition, a circular economy can be suitable exploitation of re-
sources through cyclic flows of material and energy. A circular economy
under proper LCA does not compromise the future availability of natural
resources and reduces GHG emissions and reliance on virgin materials.
When this concept is translated to polyolefin manufacture, it is clear that
the  circular  economy  advocates  for  the  production  of  virgin  plastics
using chemical recycling of plastic wastes to obtain the valuable light
olefins (Fig. 29) [374,375].

As can be seen in Fig. 29, the recycling cycle can be both open-loop
and closed-loop. In an open-loop, recycled products (wax) can be used as
raw  materials  in  other  industries,  while  in  a  closed-loop,  recycled
products (light olefins) are used as raw materials in the same industry.

loop recycling (adapted from [374]).

and modular technologies cross-over (adapted from [359]).

[361–363].

The increasing amount of plastic solid waste (PSW) in landfills in-
dicates the inefficiency of conventional waste disposal methods and a
need to rely on up-to-date and effective methods such as pyrolysis and
steam cracking, in addition to industrialization on a global scale. In the
not-too-distant  future,  chemical  processes  for  PSW  disposal  will  be
industrialized one after another, and if LCA is not considered, not only
are environmental problems unresolved but they may also be intensified
in some cases [364–366].

A literature review shows that the LCA provided, e.g., on chemical
recycling of PSW, can have very different outcomes. Proper LCA of a
chemical process requires familiarity with the process basics and opti-
mization  and  generally  requires  a  high  level  of  experience  to  avoid
providing incorrect information [363,367–370]. For example, in a py-
rolysis process, as discussed in the previous sections, the optimization of
process parameters affects the selectivity toward light olefins, methane,
coke, and aromatics. Reducing methane and coke formation, which are
often incinerated, and high selectivity of valuable products are impor-
tant handles for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the chemical
recycling process.

The  LCA  matrix  model  indicates  that  the  optimal  disposal  and
recycling methods vary depending on the polymer type, which results in
applying several technologies in a circular economy toward full plastic

5.3. Greenhouse gas (GHG) protocol

Although chemical recycling is claimed to be more sustainable, how
can these emissions be reduced on short notice without a detrimental
impact on the economy? Essential in this context is the greenhouse gas
(GHG) protocol, a global standard for companies and organizations to
measure and manage their GHG emissions and become more efficient,
resilient, and successful, as schematically illustrated in Fig. 30 [376]. In
short, the GHG Protocol is a book-keeping system that divides emissions
into three categories: Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3. Simplified for most
chemical processes, Scope 1 is related to the process itself, Scope 2 is
related to the electricity used, Scope 3 is related to the feedstock pro-
duction and transport [376,377]. The Scope 3 emissions also point to an
important  aspect  that  is  related  to  the  emissions  related  to  the  used
feedstock. For example, if a source like plastic waste is used instead of a
fossil starting material, the Scope 3 emissions will be very lower [378].
In a process like steam cracking, which is the dominant process for the
production  of  ethylene,  propylene,  1,3-butadiene,  and  aromatics,  the
Scope 3 emissions are higher than the sum of Scope 1 and 2 emissions if a
fossil feedstock is used [379]. Note that this GHG protocol will also be
used to make decisions related to which materials will be used in the
process itself. Also, for the production, Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3
emissions  will  be  key  elements  to  make  decisions  which  option  is
favored [380].

5.4. CO2  emissions (Scopes 1, 2, 3)

Millions of tons of chemicals are produced annually, and the energy
required for their production is usually provided by combusting fossil
fuels, which has led to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions world-
wide.  The  petrochemical  industry  directly  produces  about  5  wt.%  of
global  CO2  emissions,  while  emissions  from  the  burning  of  refineries
fuels constitute an even larger fraction. Today’s petrochemical industry
is reported to consume about 10 wt.% of fossil carbon used as feedstock
and  another  7  wt.%  as  energy  to  drive  its  chemical  processes.  On
average, the CO2  emissions from producing base chemicals amount to
about 1–2.5 kg CO2/kg product. This ratio increases to ~2.5 kg CO2/kg
plastic  in  plastic  manufacturing  and  ~5  kg  CO2/kg  plastic  when
including product use and disposal. If all these elements are included,
plastics emit 1.7 Gt/year of CO2  or ~4 wt.% of global greenhouse gas
emissions  [71].  The  GHG  emission  from  the  plastic  industry  can  be
assessed from Scopes 1,2, and 3.

• Scope 1

Khoo [363] has assessed the GHG production from different waste
disposal methods with other cases based on kg CO2-eq/t PSW (Fig. 31).
As can be seen, the GHG results from WTE/incineration [363] (~1000
kg CO2eq/t PSW) fall within a lower range as compared to those reported
by Gear et al. [367] (~1800 kg CO2eq/t PSW) and Morandin et al. [369]
(~1800 kg CO2eq/t PSW). The lower CO2 production in WTE is mainly

regarding the energy supply, which mostly comes from methane. The
reported results  of Khoo  for  mechanical recycling were  matched well
with  WRAP,  while  Nagy  reported  significantly  lower  GHG  emissions
using by 50 wt.% hydroelectric energy [363]. As seen in Fig. 31, under
different  process  parameters,  both  gasification  (370–880  kg  CO2-eq/t
PSW) and pyrolysis (600 to 870 kg CO2-eq/t PSW) resulted in varying
GHG emissions [363]. Gear et al. [367] have also presented a thermal
plastic  cracking  process  as  an  alternative  to  replace  landfilling  and
incineration with appropriate GHG emissions. The reported GHG emis-
sions from tested pilot-scale designs fell between the range of pyrolysis
and gasification technologies [363].

The  next  step  in  Scope  1  to  reduce  GHG  will  be  the  direct  use  of
electricity to make molecules, e.g., by electrolyzing water into hydrogen
and oxygen, plasma pyrolysis of plastics [90,384], and using plasma to
produce  ethylene  from  methane  [385].  This  “power  to  chemicals”
approach has the potential to contribute to the transition of the chemical
industry away from the use of fossil fuels as an energy source. It will
affect how the top commodity chemicals, such as ammonia, light olefins,
methanol, and aromatics, which have large markets and  huge energy
demands,  are  produced.  These  chemicals  form  the  basis  for  further
transformation into end-products [386].

• Scope 2

In  recent  years,  the  use  of  electricity  to  heat  reactors  has  been
considered. The literature has also shown that the use of electricity to
heat the reactor has been effective in increasing production efficiency
[387]. This can reduce environmental pollution if electricity is supplied
through renewable energies such as solar or wind energy [386]. To make
that a bit more tangible with hydrogen as an example, electrolysis with
renewable electricity would result in zero Scope 2 emissions, whereas if
gray  electricity  would  be  used,  the  Scope  2  emissions  would  become
enormous.  If  a  coal-based  power  plant  would  be  used  for  providing
electricity, the emissions of an electrolyzer would be substantially larger
than from steam methane reforming [388].

• Scope 3

Regarding  Scope  3,  to  reduce  CO2  emissions,  the  industry  has  to
switch from carbon-rich (coal and oil) to hydrogen-rich (gas) feedstock.
Carbon-rich feedstocks are known to lead to high carbon emissions for
methanol  and  ammonia  synthesis.  With  the  use  of  natural  gas  rather
than coal, CO2  emissions, e.g., in the synthesis of NH3  and methanol,
have been reduced by ~50 and ~90 wt.%, respectively. On the other
hand,  specific  CO2  emissions  from  using  ethane  as  a  feed  for  steam
crackers decreased by 53 and 63 wt.% compared to using naphtha and
gasoil, respectively. In addition, specific CO2  equivalents of backflows
steam  crackers  using  ethane  as  feed  are  zero,  while  for  naphtha  and
gasoil, they amount to 0.9 and 2.1 kg CO2  per kg ethylene produced,
respectively [71].

5.5. Improved sorting

Today,  modern  sorting  facilities  typically  produce  #11  different
plastic streams out of (kerbside) collected waste (Fig. 32). It is expected
that  this  will  be  the  status  quo  for  the  coming  decade.  These  sorting
plants are quite advanced and can achieve purity above 90 wt.%. Yet,
this purity is typically classified as ‘product purity’  and not ‘materials
purity’. Material purities drop below 90 wt.%, and even then, this mass
of  polymer  contains  a  chemical  complexity  such  as  additives,  fillers,
inks, adsorbed odor components, etc. [389,390].

To date, mechanical recycling is the most commonly applied recy-
cling technology since this technology requires relatively little energy
and resources [391,392]. However, mechanical recycling faces various
challenges,  such  as  additives/fillers,  thermal-mechanical  degradation,
and  immiscibility  of  different  polymers,  making  the  production  of
high-quality  products  from  heterogeneous  waste  streams  very  chal-
lenging [32]. Another issue is the presence of certain components such
as odorous constituents and inks, often containing metals and halogens
and raising issues towards regulatory compliance (e.g., for food contact
materials) [393].

Fig.  32  gives  an  overview  of  the  actual  situation  in  Flanders

(Belgium) concerning plastic waste recycling and its relationship with
classical  (petro)chemical  production.  Mechanical  recycling  allows  for
the successful recycling of  the present PET  bottle streams  and maybe
addresses the recycling of very pure HDPE and PP waste streams, but it
doesn’t provide a solution for the complete closed-loop recycling of PET
trays, HDPE and PP bottles and trays, PS trays, PE and other films, and
residual  fractions  (streams  #4–11  of  Fig.  32).  For  the  polyolefin  and
polystyrene waste streams (streams #5–11), accounting for 2/3 of the
plastic waste volume, chemical recycling needs to be considered [389,
390]. Pyrolysis and gasification are by far the most explored technolo-
gies in that respect [90] but suffer from several challenges:

• Contamination of the polyolefinic material by imperfect sorting and
the presence of additives/hetero-elements in the polyolefinic waste
can  lead  to  operational  issues  (e.g.,  coking,  catalyst  poisoning,
corrosion) [389].

• Low-value product creation: classical chemical recycling plants have
tried  to  create  a  stream  that  is  sent  back  to  a  refinery  (or  steam
cracking unit) and of which the naphtha fraction after pretreatment
is converted to olefins [124]. Chemical recycling has thus focused on
low-value  oil  or  gas  production  from  streams  that  are  sometimes

equally  expensive.  Furthermore,  often  hydrotreatment  (using
expensive H2) of the pyrolysis oil to maintain its stability needs to be
performed [174].

The purification of the plastic waste stream remains one of the main
challenges within the chemical recycling of plastic waste. Currently, no
standards  or  purity  grades  exist  to  describe  the  plastic  waste  feed.
Kusenberg et al. showed that regular plastic waste pyrolysis oil is not
suited as a direct feedstock for steam cracking as it contains too many
impurities  [42].  Contaminants  such  as  halogens,  nitrogen,  and  sulfur
can be removed by hydrotreatment which is a mature technology but
requires expensive hydrogen. Filtering or solvent treatments are other
alternatives that should be studied to ensure the processability of the
plastic waste feed for catalytic pyrolysis or steam cracking after thermal
pyrolysis. The effect of contaminants within plastic waste pyrolysis oils
for  steam  cracking  is  already  increasingly  being  investigated.  In
contrast,  for  catalytic  pyrolysis  this  is  not  the  case  as  current  studies
mainly focus on pure polymers or model compounds. Therefore, a shift
towards representative feedstocks in catalytic pyrolysis should also be
executed. By doping pure polymer feeds with certain contaminants, the
effect  of  these  contaminants  on  the  product  distribution  and  catalyst
stability can be clarified.

To  resolve  the  second challenge  which  is  related  to  the  low-value
product  creation,  the  focus  needs  to  shift  to  the  direct  production  of
light olefins and aromatics from plastic waste. These products are far
more valuable than pyrolysis oils or low-value gasses, and the need for
further downstream processing options, such as the hydrotreatment and
steam cracking of plastic waste pyrolysis oils can be reduced. The cat-
alytic  pyrolysis of  plastic  waste alleviates  this  burden,  as  the  catalyst
allows to steer the product distribution to a desired valuable fraction.
However, the design of these catalysts still heavily relies on trial-and-
error  high-throughput  experimental  campaigns.  Therefore,  more
fundamental  knowledge  on  the  important  reaction  pathways  and  in-
fluence of the catalyst structure on the product distribution is required.
The construction of kinetic models based on first principles and theo-
retical  calculations  will  allow  to  acquire  this  essential  knowledge.
Moreover, on-line product measurement can shed some light into the
character of the active site, and allow to synthesize more active, selec-
tive and stable catalysts. The deactivation of the catalyst remains one of
the main challenges in the industrialization of catalytic pyrolysis. This is
both related to the previously mentioned presence of contaminants as to
the  properties  of  the  catalyst,  which  affect  coke  laydown.  Hence,  an
investigation of the nature of the coking process in zeolites is required
for an improved catalyst design.

5.6. Industrial technologies

Regarding the high potential and many advantages of catalytic py-
rolysis, several processes have reached the industrial stage. However,
various  research  and  industrial  centers  have  focused  on  the  catalytic
pyrolysis of plastic wastes and the production of high-quality products e.
g., light olefins [394,395]. A large number of small and large successful
industrial  projects  is  needed  in  the  coming  years  to  push  forward  a
much-needed  industrial  revolution  towards  increased  recycling  rates.
Table 8 shows some examples of installed and/or planned technologies
based on the pyrolysis of plastic wastes with a variety of products from
commercial fuels to light olefins.

6. Conclusions

A comprehensive review of the available literature on thermal and
catalytic pyrolysis of virgin and plastic wastes was conducted, with a
special focus on maximizing the production of light olefins. Based on the
literature  review,  thermochemical  recycling  of  polyolefins  has  been
widely  investigated  in  recent  years.  Although  there  are  numerous
studies  on  light  olefins  production  of  plastic  wastes,  there  are  still
several  contradictory  or  unclear  aspects  such  as  establishing  suitable
standards  for  feedstock  composition,  reactor  design,  and  optimizing
catalyst properties which require further research.

The  composition  of  MPO  including  the  PP/PE  ratio,  the  share  of
other polymers (PS, PET, PVC, and rubbers), and mineral and organic
contaminations are among the vital parameters affecting the pyrolysis
products. PVC has received more attention than other contaminations as
it is always paired with the formation of the corrosive HCl, making PVC
one of the most detrimental contaminants. Achieving standards for the
feedstock of pyrolysis plants in terms of the allowed values of different
contaminations,  double  bonds,  etc.  can  significantly  reduce  process
challenges. Currently, most studies are done with model compounds or
pure polymers. The first step that should be made is to go to mixtures
that are representative for what will actually be processed in reality. As a
starting  point  mixtures  of  different  polyolefins  should  be  extensively
studied  to  investigate  potential  cross  interactions.  This  will  lay  the
foundation on how to maximize the production of value-added chem-
icals. In a next step, mixtures should be doped with specific impurities
(additives,  fillers,  food  contaminants,  etc.)  to  gain  understanding  on
how they affect selectivity, catalyst stability, coke formation, etc.

Another effective variable that is being researched in this field is the
appropriate  design  of  the  pyrolysis  reactor.  A  compact  reactor  with
proper  feeding  (catalyst,  feedstock),  minimum  residence  time,  proper
heat and mass transfer along with minimum energy consumption can
compensate  some  of  the  concerns  in  the  field  of  plastic  pyrolysis.
Currently,  different  reactor  types  such  as  vortex,  CSBR,  downer  and

fluidized-bed reactors are being investigated in this field in a laboratory
and semi-industrial manner. Optimal designs in terms of residence time,
energy consumption, coke formation rate, and efficiency at high tem-
peratures can pave the way for industrialization as soon as possible.

Along with feedstock and reactor design, process parameters play a
key  role  in  determining  the  final  product.  Temperature  is  one  of  the
critical factors in the production of light olefins, and, an optimal tem-
perature can result in maximum light olefin production. The secondary
reactions and chain scission intensify with increasing temperature and
result  in  an  increase  in  coke,  aromatics,  and  methane.  The  residence
time, which depends on the reactor design, greatly affects the produc-
tion of light olefins, and long residence times (in the order of seconds)
increase  methane,  aromatics,  and  coke  formation.  Catalytic  pyrolysis
using suitable zeolite catalysts can increase product selectivity and light
olefin  production  while  lowering  energy  consumption  due  to  lower
operating temperatures than thermal pyrolysis. Furthermore, catalytic
pyrolysis compared to pyrolysis followed by steam cracking of the py-
rolysis  liquid to  achieve light  olefins recovery  from polyolefins  waste
results  in  higher  P/E  ratio  and  a  lower  CO2  footprint.  Catalyst/feed
contact  mode  is  another  influential  factor  affecting  the  production  of
light  olefins.  From  a  process  point  of  view,  due  to  the  high  cost  of
decontamination and the high ability of plastic contaminants to deac-
tivate catalysts, the ex-situ mode can bring much fewer process prob-
lems. On the other hand, the process costs of using two reactors to carry
out the process in ex-situ mode should be considered. Furthermore, the
porosity,  spatial  structure  and  acid  site  strength  of  zeolites  influence
which products are actually formed. However, it is unclear how these
catalyst properties individually affect the final product distribution. To
improve our understanding, the construction of kinetic models based on
first principles and theoretical calculations could therefore be beneficial.
They could help us to gain understanding on a molecular level what is
happening on the active sites, in the pores and on the support. Moreover,
on-line measurement of the formed products together with advanced in-
situ  characterization  techniques  can  provide  further  insights  of  the
generation and transformation of intermediates and active sites. On the
other hand, impurities can cause permanent deactivation or increased
coke formation. This implies that designing robust catalysts remains a
challenge. We therefore consider this as the main hurdle for the large-
scale implementation of catalytic pyrolysis. Essential in this context is
unraveling  the  specific  formation  mechanism  of  coke  on  catalyst  sur-
faces  and  gaining  an  understanding  on  the  impact  of  impurities  on
deactivation and coke formation. As described above, the utilization of
in-situ  characterization  techniques  and  experiments  with  model  com-
pounds and  specific  impurities can provide guidelines  to suggest pre-
treatment strategies for the waste materials and design novel catalysts.
Suitable catalysts for the production of light olefins from polyolefins
have a pore size between 4 and 5.6 Å, and promoters such as phosphorus
are used to reduce the catalyst deactivation rate. Addition of mesopores
to  microporous  zeolites  and/or  utilizing  nanoparticle  size  of  zeolite
catalysts are promising options to reduce the effective residence time of
the reactants and products in the catalyst particle, which can decrease
the extent of secondary reactions and coke and aromatic formation. The
literature  review  shows  that  zeolites  of  the  HZSM-5  type  have  been
thoroughly investigated for light olefins production and suitable prop-
erties  (catalyst  acidity,  meso‐porosity,  promotion)  and  reaction  tem-
perature  ranges  were  identified.  Meanwhile,  other  catalysts  have
received far less attention and more in-depth studies on the optimization
of other potential catalysts should be performed to assess their potential
in the field of light olefins production.

In  general,  designing  a  suitable  light  olefin  refinery  from  plastic
waste requires a specific and defined feedstock, proper reactor design
and a catalyst with high activity, low deactivation rate, and suitable pore
structure.  Hydrogen  and/or  steam  as  active  carrier  gasses  aid  in
reducing  process  problems  such  as  fouling  and  catalyst  coking.  In
addition, aiming for a short residence time –while ensuring high levels of
feedstock conversion– and ensuring an isothermal reactor temperature

profile and suitable heat and mass transfer are important parameters.
Therefore,  advanced  reactors,  such  as  compact  and  electrified  vortex
reactors operating at high velocities, are highly promising. Furthermore,
catalyst  integration  with  these  process  intensification  reactor  types,
demonstrating the long term catalyst stability in continuous operated
systems is a key area for future investigation.

Florence  H.  Vermeire:  Dr.  ir.  Florence  Vermeire  is  a  post-
doctoral research at the Laboratory for Chemical Technology
(LCT) of Ghent University. Her main research focusses on the
use  of  detailed  chemical  kinetic  modeling  and  machine
learning for various applications. In collaboration with other
Ph.D. students and postdocs,  her latest work focusses  on the
development  of  kinetic  models  to  describe  the  thermal
decomposition  of  plastic  waste.  For  her  research  on  kinetic
modeling, she uses a combination of quantum chemistry, ma-
chine learning, automated software development, and experi-
mental validation. She obtained her Ph.D. at Ghent University
in May 2019 for research on the kinetic modeling of gas-phase
processes for the combustion and pyrolysis of various biofuels. During her Ph.D., she was a
visiting researcher at CNRS in Nancy and Shanghai Jiao Tong University. After her Ph.D.,
she spent 2 years as a postdoctoral researcher in the Green group at MIT focusing on the
development of machine learning tools for chemical property prediction.

Jogchum  Oenema:  Jogchum  Oenema  is  a  postdoctoral
researcher at the Laboratory of Chemical Technology (LCT) at
Ghent University, specializing in chemical recycling of waste
plastics  using  pyrolysis.  In  2021,  he  graduated  as  a  PhD  in
heterogeneous catalysis from Utrecht University, focusing on
bifunctional catalyst for hydrocracking processes. Prior to his
PhD, he obtained master’s degree in chemistry from the same
university,  which  included  a  research  stay  at  the  European
Synchrotron Research Facility in Grenoble.

Robin  John  Varghese:  Robin  John  Varghese  obtained  his
Master of Technology in Mechanical Engineering from Amrita
University, India, in 2013. He joined the Aerospace Engineer-
ing department of the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay
to pursue a Ph.D. in Combustion in 2014. His-Ph.D. research
focused on measuring burning velocities of syngas-air mixtures
at  elevated  temperatures  and  pressures.  He  established  an
experimental facility to facilitate the measurement of burning
velocities for a simultaneous change in thermodynamic vari-
ables; temperature and pressure. He also developed a machine
learning  model  to  accurately  predict  the  burning  velocity  of
low calorific value syngas mixtures. He successfully defended
his Ph.D. thesis and joined the Laboratory for Chemical Technology at Ghent University,
Belgium, as a postdoctoral researcher in 2020. His-primary expertise involves analyzing
complex  reaction  products  of  a  microreactor  facility  employing  two-dimensional  gas
chromatography  and  electron  mass  spectrometry.  His-current  postdoctoral  research  fo-
cuses on catalytic pyrolysis of solid waste plastics and pyrolysis of renewable fuels.

Yannick Ureel: Yannick Ureel obtained his Master of Science
in  Chemical  Engineering  degree  from  Ghent  University  in
2021. He proceeded as a PhD student for the Laboratory  for
Chemical Technology, after receiving a personal FWO-research
grant  from  the  Flemish  Government.  His-doctoral  research
focusses on the kinetic modeling of the catalytic pyrolysis of
plastic  waste  based  on  first-principles.  Moreover,  he  in-
vestigates opportunities  for  machine  learning  applications  in
the field of reaction modeling.
