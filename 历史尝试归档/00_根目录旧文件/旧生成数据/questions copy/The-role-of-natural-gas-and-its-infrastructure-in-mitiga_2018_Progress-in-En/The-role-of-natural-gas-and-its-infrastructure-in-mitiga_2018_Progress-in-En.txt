The pursuit of future energy systems that can meet electricity demands while supporting the attainment of
societal environment goals, including mitigating climate change and reducing pollution in the air, has led to
questions regarding the viability of continued use of natural gas. Natural gas use, particularly for electricity
generation, has increased in recent years due to enhanced resource availability from non-traditional
reserves and pressure to reduce greenhouse gasses (GHG) from higher-emitting sources, including coal gen-
eration. While lower than coal emissions, current natural gas power generation strategies primarily utilize
combustion with higher emissions of GHG and criteria pollutants than other low-carbon generation options,
including renewable resources. Furthermore, emissions from life cycle stages of natural gas production and
distribution can have additional detrimental GHG and air quality (AQ) impacts. On the other hand, natural
gas power generation can play an important role in supporting renewable resource integration by (1) pro-
viding essential load balancing services, and (2) supporting the use of gaseous renewable fuels through the
existing infrastructure of the natural gas system. Additionally, advanced technologies and strategies includ-
ing fuel cells and combined cooling heating and power (CCHP) systems can facilitate natural gas generation
with low emissions and high efficiencies. Thus, the role of natural gas generation in the context of GHG mit-
igation and AQ improvement is complex and multi-faceted, requiring consideration of more than simple
quantification of total or net emissions. If appropriately constructed and managed, natural gas generation
could support and advance sustainable and renewable energy. In this paper, a review of the literature
regarding emissions from natural gas with a focus on power generation is conducted and discussed in the
context of GHG and AQ impacts. In addition, a pathway forward is proposed for natural gas generation and
infrastructure to maximize environmental benefits and support renewable resources in the attainment of
emission reductions.

1. Introduction and background

PThe current interchange between energy and the environment is
prompting fundamental shifts in societal management of energy
systems,
including electricity generation. Climactic change by
anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gasses (GHG) is perhaps the
important driver of environmentally-influenced societal
most
change [1]. Deep reductions in GHG emissions (e.g., 50 to 80% below
2005 levels by 2050) are being required from developed nations for
prevention of detrimental climate impacts [2,3]. Of similar concern,
pollution in the air is expected to be the single largest global cause
of environmentally-related premature mortality by 2050 [4]. Many
regions of the United States (U.S.) experience air quality (AQ) chal-
lenges with atmospheric concentrations in excess of Federal health-
based standards; and reducing pollutants such as ground-level
ozone and particulate matter (PM) is necessary to improve public
health [5]. Emphasizing the scale of necessary displacement, note
that stabilizing the climate may require the complete de-carboniza-
tion of energy sectors [6]. Hence, technological and fuel shifts that
can contribute to both GHG mitigation and regional AQ improve-
ment represent good solutions for energy systems [7,8].

PElectricity generation will likely receive a major focus in future
U.S. GHG mitigation policies (perhaps even disproportionately rela-
tive to other sectors) because (1) it is currently the highest GHG
emitting sector in the U.S. [9], (2) many alternative strategies exist
to generate electricity with little to no GHG emissions [10], (3) elec-
trification in additional end-use sectors (i.e., transportation, indus-
trial, building demands) achieves GHG reductions if the electricity is
decarbonized [11], and (4) emissions from many sources (e.g., large
capacity generators) are concentrated and more suitable for emis-
sions control applications, including carbon capture and storage
(CCS) [12]. It is clear then that any meaningful U.S. GHG mitigation
effort must have mechanisms to institute extensive changes to exist-
ing electrical supply chains in pursuit of emission reductions (cid:1)
including regulating carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from existing
and future power plants [13].

PElectricity generation also contributes to regional AQ concerns,
including ground-level concentrations of pollutant species such as
ozone and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) [14]. Combustion pro-
cesses and other life cycle stages associated with conventional tech-
nologies and fossil fuels, including natural gas, result in atmospheric
releases of gaseous and particulate pollutants; including nitrogen
oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2), volatile organic compounds
(VOC), carbon monoxide (CO) and particulate matter (PM) [15]. For
example, stationary fossil fuel combustion for electricity is by far
and away the largest source of domestic anthropogenic SO2 [9]. It
follows then that emissions of GHGs and pollutant species are highly
correlated as a result of shared generation sources and processes.
Thus, an important opportunity exists to simultaneously address U.
S. GHG and AQ concerns by deploying alternative, low emitting gen-
eration strategies. Conversely, pursuit of GHG mitigation must seek
to avoid unforeseen tradeoffs with pollutant emissions, and vice
versa.

PIn this context, it is generally agreed that increasing renewable
electricity generation (including from solar, wind, geothermal,
ocean, hydropower and biopower resources) is necessary to satisfac-
torily meet demands commensurate with achieving environmental

Pquality goals [16]. Given the challenge of sufficiently decarbonizing
energy systems to meet long-term GHG goals, assessments generally
show that we must replace natural gas (and all other fossil fuels) at
high levels (cid:1) both with electrification in end-use sectors and with
renewable resources for electricity generation (e.g., see [11,17(cid:1)19]).
Renewable technologies are often proposed as replacements for fos-
sil power generation, including natural gas, as they are perhaps the
best solution for electricity generation [20]. Some have suggested
the immediate displacement of natural gas generation to avoid
GHG-producing technology lock-in [20]. Additional
low-carbon
technologies commonly considered for GHG mitigation include
energy storage to address the controllability and intermittency of
renewable power generation, various forms of nuclear energy, fossil
generation equipped with CCS, and methods to reduce demand via
improvements in the efficiency of generation, transmission, distribu-
tion and end-use.

PHowever, the role of natural gas is somewhat unique in that it can
represent both a means of obtaining carbon reductions, and an
essential target for displacement with lower-carbon alternatives,
depending upon the considered sector and strategy and the dynam-
ics of operation. While it is generally accepted that shifts away from
coal and petroleum are required for significant emissions mitigation
(or the deployment of additional measures such as CCS), the poten-
tial role of natural gas infrastructure in a future sustainable energy
supply is less clear. Current natural gas electricity generation strate-
gies primarily utilize combustion, which generates emissions of
both pollutants and GHG, while the natural gas system directly emits
GHG, primarily methane. Still others have warned against the utility
of natural gas as a bridging fuel since it may slow the development
of needed advanced, “ending” technologies [21] or represent an
unacceptable environmental risk when resources are obtained from
unconventional resources [22]. The concerns over natural gas
generation are amplified by increasing awareness of significant
methane emissions from the natural gas system, concerns that
were heightened by the recent occurrence of a major leakage event
in California [23].

POn the other hand, natural gas can potentially represent a cleaner
and more efficient fuel relative to other fossil options (e.g., coal,
petroleum) and direct replacement can have immediate emission
benefits,1 e.g., increases in gas generation have recently led to reduc-
tions in total domestic GHG emissions [24]. Due to this, natural gas
has been advocated for as an effective short- to mid-term “bridge”
fuel to a low-carbon future, most notably in the context of providing
a cost-effective option for displacing coal-fired power plants
[25(cid:1)27]. Further, natural gas is a cost-effective and established
energy source with many applications in various energy sectors
including power generation, transportation, industry, and the built
environment. Natural gas currently represents an important compo-
nent of the U.S. energy system amongst all sectors with the excep-
tion of transportation. The use of natural gas in the U.S. has steadily
increased in the last decade (cid:1) mirroring the rise in availability of
unconventional reserves (cid:1) and the trend is expected to continue in

1 This is in-part because natural gas is predominantly composed of methane which
has the lowest carbon to hydrogen ratio of commonly used fossil fuels and in-part
because of the high efficiency and low emissions characteristics of modern natural
gas combined cycle power plants

Pcoming decades [28]. This is particularly true for electricity genera-
tion - both the current and expected mix of U.S. generation include
natural gas use at high levels (i.e., coal and natural gas currently
account for 37% and 30% of U.S. power generation) [29]. The dis-
placement of natural gas from domestic energy systems therefore
represents a major undertaking and could require significant invest-
ment in more expensive alternatives. Furthermore, natural gas
power generation can provide important energy services including
the ability to provide grid-balancing services that can well comple-
ment the integration of intermittent renewable resources (including
wind and solar) into regional electrical grids. Additionally, the exist-
ing natural gas system infrastructure can be used to store, transport,
and distribute renewable gaseous fuels and could provide a long-
term transition path from an entirely fossil to entirely renewable
system. Thus, the role of natural gas moving forward in the greater
context of GHG mitigation and AQ improvement is complex and
multi-faceted requiring considerations of more than simple quantifi-
cation and comparison of total emissions.

PIt is with this uncertainty that natural gas approaches a cross-
roads in terms of energy and the environment. Thus, there is a need
for further understanding by what means natural gas generation and
natural gas infrastructure can support short- to long-term environ-
mental quality goals in terms of pathways forward from an eco-
nomic and regulatory perspective. This work seeks to provide some
clarity by evaluating the literature for natural gas electricity genera-
tion to gain insights into the emissions of GHG and criteria pollu-
tants with implications for regional AQ. Additionally, technology
transitions that could be applied to maximize GHG and AQ co-bene-
fits are discussed in the context of pathways forward. Section 2 of
this work reviews emissions from conventional natural gas genera-
tion with a specific focus on comparison to coal generation methods.
Section 3 presents an overview of advanced natural gas conversion
methods that can provide efficiency and emission benefits relative
to conventional technologies. Section 4 provides an overview of
potential GHG and AQ impacts of additional low-carbon generation
methods for comparison with natural gas. Section 5 reviews and dis-
cusses potential for natural gas generation to support the integration
and use of renewable resources as a means of maximizing AQ and
GHG benefits. Finally, Section 6 provides discussion and proposes an
evolution of natural gas infrastructure to best attain sustainable

Pelectricity provision while maximizing GHG and AQ co-benefits. It
should be noted that the scope of this review is natural gas use for
electricity generation and does not consider in-depth use in addi-
tional energy end-use sectors including transportation, industry,
and the built environment.

2. Emissions from traditional natural gas generation

PCurrent methods of natural gas generation generally comprise
combustion with technologies commonly used including conven-
tional boilers, steam turbines, simple-cycle gas turbines (NGCT) and
combined cycle (NGCC) systems. Additionally, combustion to power
a small turbine or reciprocating engine is often utilized, particularly
in smaller, distributed-scale applications. NGCC plants are com-
prised of three main components, (1) a gas turbine (Brayton cycle
that includes compressor, combustor and turbine), (2) a steam tur-
bine (operating on the Rankine cycle), and (3) a heat recovery steam
generator that integrates the two cycles together by generating
steam from the upstream gas turbine exhaust [30]. At the central
plant scale NGCC plants are capable of high fuel-to-electricity effi-
ciency potentially in excess of 60% measured at lower heating value
(LHV) and low criteria pollutant emissions when integrated with a
selective catalytic reduction (SCR) emissions clean up system [31].
Simple-cycle gas turbines used in power plants are now available
with efficiencies greater than 40% [32]. The higher efficiencies and
reduced emissions of NGCC make them preferable to other genera-
tion types and it is likely NGCC plants will be the dominant technol-
ogy for new capacity in the U.S. [33,34]. An additional capability of
natural gas generation includes combined cooling heating and
power (CCHP) with efficiency and economic improvements by cap-
turing and using waste heat for useful work [35]. Gas turbines are
highly effective for CCHP applications due to high exhaust tempera-
tures which can generate process steam used for a variety of pur-
poses (e.g., to meet heating or cooling loads for a large commercial
building, used directly for industrial purposes). CCHP devices and
impacts are discussed in Section 3.1.

PA range of factors impact direct2 emissions from natural gas gen-
eration including selected conversion technology, size, age, operat-
ing load and dynamics, presence or absence of pollutant controls,
gas composition, and others. Reported emissions generally represent
data collected during operation at design conditions (e.g., greater
than 80% of rated capacity) [36]. However, this may not be wholly
representative of real-world operation which is often dynamic in
nature. Emission rates from turbines under reduced loads or during
rapid load adjustment are typically higher due to lower efficiencies,
less complete combustion, and off-design operation of air pollution
control equipment [37]. Additionally, the generators most likely to
respond to grid dynamics, such as those operating on the margin,
are often simple cycle turbines with higher emissions and lower effi-
ciencies [38]. Finally, the start-up and shut-down of power plants
also usually entail periods of relative high emissions (of both GHG
and pollutants) per unit of power generated [39].

PNatural gas generation produces emissions of CO2, methane, and
nitrous oxide (N2O), with CO2 being the predominant direct emis-
sion. Life cycle air emissions through the point-of-generation for a
555 megawatt (MW) NGCC generation facility utilizing two parallel,
advanced F-Class combustion turbines followed by heat recovery
steam generators are shown in Table 1. The plant typifies a facility
representative of future plant construction in the replacement of
less efficient facilities and/or to provide needed new-
retired,
installed capacity [34]. State-of-the-art natural gas generation also
may further reduce emissions from conventional technologies, e.g.,

2 An important distinction should be made between direct emissions, which are
released from the point-of-generation, and life cycle emissions which occur through-
out the various stages of natural gas production and distribution

P358 g CO2 equivalents per kilowatt hour (CO2e /kWh) as reported in
[40] for a life cycle 517 MW NGCC base load facility with a net HHV
efficiency of 50.2%. Generally, life cycle emissions (i.e., including all
stages of gas production and distribution) have been reported for
natural gas combustion turbines from 487 to 987 gCO2e/kWh
[41,42] and 306 to 681 for combined cycle plants [31,36,40(cid:1)48]
(Table 2).

PDirect pollutant emissions from natural gas plants include NOx,
CO, VOC, PM, SO2 and potentially hazardous air pollutants (HAP)
including formaldehyde [52,53]. Generally, emissions of SO2 and PM
are low, while emissions of NOx and CO require emissions control
including combustion design and SCR [36]. Average NOx emission
rates from an existing fleet of NGCC plants measured under EPA
reporting requirements were 0.0635 g/kWh, equivalent to a reduc-
tion of 92.7% from average U.S. coal-, oil-, and natural gas-fired
plants [48]. Similar to GHG impacts, it is estimated that growth in
the fraction of domestic gas generation in place of coal from
1995(cid:1)2012 reduced CO2 (23%), NOx (40%), and SO2 (44%) emissions
from U.S. fossil-fuel power plants [33]. With SCR and/or lean pre-
mixed combustion emissions of NOx for large gas turbines are often
well below 10 parts per million (ppm) as seen for the plant in Table 1
[32]. Emissions from an advanced 560 MW NGCC plant at a capacity
factor of 85% with best available control technology (BACT) achieved
requirements from the 2006 New Source Performance Standards (i.
e., 2.5 ppm volumetric dry referenced to 15% O2) via a combination
of dry low-NOx burner combustion and SCR systems with actual
emissions measured at 0.0139 g NOx/kWh [36]. Emissions of addi-
tional pollutants including SO2, PM, and mercury were negligible.
Demonstrating variation with specific plant characteristics and
others, direct pollutant emissions from the 555 MW NGCC plant in
[49] were reported at 0.0305 g NOx/kWh.

PThese values generally represent a reduction from coal (i.e., from
current and advanced coal plants in [40]) but are higher than other
alternative technologies including renewables, nuclear power, and

Pthe deployment of CCS, e.g., see [10,54(cid:1)56]. Solely considering direct
emissions, natural gas represents an option for GHG emissions miti-
gation and potential AQ improvements if replacing coal plant opera-
tion, particularly in the near-term, and it is this ability that has led to
the proposition as a bridge fuel to future, cleaner technologies
[57,58]. The carbon content for natural gas is roughly half that of
coal per unit of energy, and gas-fired technologies generally have
higher efficiencies and reduced emissions of major pollutant and
HAP species, including mercury, NOx, CO, SO2 and PM [34,40,57].
Table 3 contains the national average GHG and pollutant emission
factors for 2010 U.S. generation. Current coal integrated gasification
combined cycle (IGCC) facilities emit NOx at similar levels to NGCC
and reduced levels from simple cycle natural gas turbines, but rep-
resent only 0.1% of coal combustion technologies relative to steam
turbines. Similarly, averaging of historical emissions data on exist-
ing U.S. power plants shows that coal-fired plants emit approxi-
mately double the CO2 of both NGCT and NGCC plants [33]. This
trend is also evident in emission projection data as transitions to
natural gas from higher GHG intensity fossil fuels contribute to
energy related CO2 emissions slightly declining in total from 2005
to 2040 [29].

PAdvanced coal generation strategies could potentially improve
efficiencies and reduce emissions from current coal technologies,
including ultra- and advanced ultra-supercritical technologies (A-
USC), fluidized bed combustion (FBC), oxy-combustion, and various
IGCC configurations [60(cid:1)62]. Advanced coal concepts also include
CCS to reduce CO2 emissions, however CCS is considered and dis-
cussed in Section 4.3 as CCS is also applicable to natural gas

Pgeneration. The use of fuel cells to convert syngas to electricity
(IGFC) can further reduce emissions and may represent the lowest
emitting coal pathway if CCS is also integrated (Table 4). Fig. 1 dem-
onstrates a simple diagram of an IGFC strategy for coal conversion,
although other fuels including biomass are also suitable. These strat-
egies can reduce GHG and pollutant emissions significantly from
current coal generation methods, e.g., sub- and supercritical pulver-
ized coal plants (Table 4). IGCC can potentially represent the cleanest
pathway for coal generation [63]. However, emission rates of GHG
and pollutants are higher for technologies requiring significant
advancement prior to commercialization compared to NGCC plants
already commercially deployed and economically competitive, e.g.,
the plant discussed in [49]. Advancements may also be made with
regards to natural gas technologies following similar trajectories to
those for coal, and it is likely that natural gas will continue to pro-
vide emission reductions and AQ improvements if displacing coal
generation in future years.

PImpacts must also be considered within the context of regional
variation in the composition of generator networks that comprise
regional electrical grids, as this is a direct determinant of overall
emissions and AQ impacts. Emission rates of CO2e, NOx, and SO2 for
current electricity generation types are shown in Table 5 for the U.S.
average and a sampling of regional grids, including the Western
Electricity Coordinating Council California (WECC CA) region, Elec-
tric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), and ReliabililtyFirst Corpo-
ration West (RFC West) including most of Indiana and Ohio and
parts of several other states including Pennsylvania, West Virginia,
Virginia, and Kentucky. When compared to the direct emission from
the NGCC plant described in [49], deploying NGCC generation would

Pachieve GHG reductions in all regions except WECC CA (largely due
to a lack of coal and higher levels of renewable generation in this
region). Additionally, emissions of NOx and SO2 are significantly
lower for NGCC than the average for all regions including WECC CA.
Thus, deploying a NGCC plant could potentially achieve GHG reduc-
tions in most regions of the U.S., but not in California, while also
reducing pollutant emissions from current generation. Pollutant
emission reductions would be larger for generation in the RFC West
and ERCOT territory, with lesser benefits in California. Therefore, the
use of gas generation for AQ and GHG mitigation is more favorable
in certain U.S. regions that others, highlighting both the regional
nature of electricity generation and AQ concerns. It should also be
noted that average emissions do not necessarily represent generation
impacted by natural gas plants, and marginal emissions are a more
appropriate method of comparing regional grid emissions [65].

PThe common understanding that natural gas represents an
opportunity for AQ and GHG co-benefits relative to coal is confirmed
by the literature. In recent years coal and natural gas have experi-
enced divergent trends in response to low natural gas prices [67]
and the development of environmental regulations targeting the
emissions of coal power plants and it is expected that natural gas
will surpass coal as the dominant power sector fuel by 2035 [29].
Indeed, this displacement has helped contribute to reductions in pol-
lutant and GHG emissions from the U.S. electricity sector in recent
years [68]. Replacing coal- with gas-fired power generation yields
reductions in direct pollutant and HAP emissions potentially trans-
lating to improvements in ambient primary and secondary pollutant
concentrations, including ozone and PM [34]. Atmospheric modeling
has shown that reductions in SO2 from natural gas displacement of
coal can reduce regional PM concentrations via PM sulfate mecha-
nisms [69]. Reductions of HAP including mercury, acid gases, metals
and metalloids, dioxins and furans will provide immediate health
benefits to populations impacted by coal power plant emissions
[68]. Also, improving the performance of emission control technol-
ogy on current coal plants can provide benefits to ground-level pol-
lution, including ozone and PM [70].

2.1. Emissions from natural gas life cycle stages

PEmissions from additional life cycle stages associated with natu-
ral gas production and distribution must be accounted for to
completely assess GHG and AQ impacts of gas generation. The
infrastructure associated with the production, storage, and distribu-
tion of natural gas to end-users is an extensive and complex sys-
tem. Using terminology from [53,71], the life cycle stages of natural
gas include pre-production, gas production, transmission, distribu-
tion and storage, and well production end-of-life, with all stages
generating emissions of GHG and pollutants [72]. Pre-production
includes all aspects of site exploration, clearing, and road construc-
tion, drilling, hydraulic fracturing, and well completion [53]. The
production stage includes the recovery, compression, and process-
ing of gas to ensure pipeline quality standards are met, with emis-
sions occurring from compressors, pumps, heaters, leaks, venting
and flare activity, and other maintenance processes [73]. The trans-
mission, storage, and distribution of natural gas include the translo-
cation of processed gas to end-users including long distance
pipelines and local distribution networks.

PDirect emissions (also termed fugitive emissions or leakage)
occurring throughout the natural gas supply chain are a key determi-
nant of climate impacts for power generation as the primary constit-
uent of natural gas is methane, a potent climate forcing gas3
[74(cid:1)76]. A variety of techniques and methods have been used to
characterize upstream methane emissions; including engineering
analyses and quantification via both bottoms-up and top-down
approaches [77(cid:1)80]. However, the current understanding of direct
methane emissions contains a substantial degree of uncertainty
which complicates a thorough understanding of technology impact
when operating on natural gas [72,77].

PAvailable life cycle studies generally demonstrate an improve-
ment from coal even if higher GHG intensity liquefied natural gas
(LNG) is utilized as a fuel (Table 2). However, it has been suggested
that life cycle (i.e., well construction through end use) methane leak-
age estimates are higher than previously thought [81]. Natural gas
electricity generation may reduce GHG emissions on all time scales
relative to coal if methane leakage rates do not exceed 3.2% of total
system production [72]. Current and projected expansion in U.S. nat-
ural gas supplies from non-traditional reserves, including those
associated with hydraulic fracturing, could also impact the climate
benefit potential of natural gas. Unconventional gas resources (e.g.,
shale gas) have been estimated to have leakage rates potentially
30(cid:1)50% higher than conventional gas with GHG emissions that
could exceed those from coal over a 20-year interval [22]. Some esti-
mates have reported that generation even from conventional gas
may not reduce GHG emissions relative to coal in the same period
[82]. However, others have questioned these conclusions citing an
overestimation of leakage rates, the short-period of global warming
potential (20-years) used for the assessment of methane impacts,
and the lack of accounting for additional benefits during conversion
[83]. Life cycle GHG emissions from the production of Marcellus
shale natural gas reported a 3% increase from traditional gas and
20(cid:1)50% decrease from coal depending on plant efficiencies and nat-
ural gas emissions variability [84]. Moreover, it has been reported
that unconventional gas may have a lower GHG footprint per mega-
joule (MJ) than conventional gas [85]. A summary of available litera-
ture estimates that emissions from the natural gas supply chain total
76.2 g CO2eq/kWh which, if included, still results in less net emis-
sions than coal when added to direct emission estimates for most
natural gas pathways [86]. A comprehensive review of the literature
concerning estimation of the GHG footprint of the domestic natural
gas production and distribution system, including traditional and
unconventional reserves, is beyond the scope of this work and can
be found in [75, 85(cid:1)87].

PShown in Table 6, quantitatively domestic methane emissions are
dominated by sources in the production and transmission and stor-
age sectors, with key sources including gathering and boosting sta-
tions, pneumatic device vents, compressors (both fugitive and
exhaust), and pipeline venting and leaks. Methane is the primary
GHG of concern for all life cycle stages of natural gas infrastructure
except generation/end-use, where CO2 is the most important
(Table 7). Pneumatic controllers are an important source of direct
methane emissions and are present in nearly all sectors of the

3 It is of interest to note that this characteristic of the fuel itself being an important

GHG is unique among common fossil fuels

Pnatural gas system, including production [88]. For the transmission,
storage, and distribution of natural gas, the predominant GHG of
concern is methane released from numerous sources including
faulty piping and valves, pneumatic controllers, and unburned meth-
ane in the exhaust of powered compressor stations [89]. Similarly,
methane emissions associated with gas leakage from plugged or
in-well production and/or in-well end-of-life
abandoned wells,
stages are a concern.

PSimilarly, pollutant emissions from life cycle stages of natural gas
recovery and production can lessen the expected AQ benefits of nat-
ural gas replacement of coal and impact human health [91]. Table 7
summarizes emissions of concern and potential AQ impacts from
different life cycle stages. Emissions from pre-production include
CO2, PM2.5, NOx, and VOC from mobile source on- and off-road diesel
engines and PM10 from road dust and tire/brake wear. Emissions
from drilling and hydraulic fracturing including engines operating
on diesel and/or natural gas have been shown to be a significant
[92]. Releases of CO2, methane, VOC, NOx, SO2, hydrogen sulfide and
various HAP occur during drilling and well completion processes
[53,91]. For wells undergoing hydraulic fracturing emissions of
methane, VOC, and HAP are possible from flowback, i.e., the return
of fluids and solids to the surface with produced water and gas [93].
Production sites and compressor stations have been associated with
high levels of VOC, NOx, PM2.5, and SOx [53,91]. A key source of
methane, VOC, and HAP emissions is liquid unloading processes
[78,94] including fugitive emissions from tanks [93]. Additional
emissions (e.g., NOx, CO2, CO) accrue from pumping stations (typi-
cally gas turbine powered compressors), let-down stations (which
burn natural gas to overcome Joule-Thomson cooling), and other
natural gas-fired equipment in the transmission, storage and distri-
bution system [95].

PUnderstanding AQ impacts from gas production from both con-
ventional and unconventional resources is challenging as emissions
from these processes vary in composition, magnitude, and duration,
and depend upon numerous factors including raw gas composition,
extraction technique, and handling approach [93]. Due to numerous
factors including the diffuse nature of some sources, different raw
gas compositions, and variation in emissions controls, the AQ
impacts from production have been reported as very significant,
minor, or none [53]. The pre-production phase can last weeks to
months, while production can persist years to decades, requiring
that the impacts must also be considered temporally. Development
of new well sites can produce harmful effects locally while avoiding
major regional impacts. The extraction and production of gas has
been linked with notable emissions of ozone precursor emissions
including NOx and VOC [91,96], the novel existence of ground-level
ozone concentrations in excess of NAAQs [22], and detrimental

Phealth effects from exposure to associated air emissions [97]. In par-
ticular, areas of gas production in Texas, Utah, Wyoming, and Colo-
rado have been associated with ozone and other AQ issues occurring
from the release of NOx, methane, CO2, and other VOC from process-
ing plants and diesel truck exhaust [98(cid:1)102]. In counties supporting
high levels of gas production total NOx emissions can be
20(cid:1)40 times higher than permitted levels for a single, minor source
[91]. Emissions from compressor engines and flaring have been
reported to significantly increase (i.e., 6(cid:1)10 ppb) ambient ozone
downwind of a hypothetical gas processing facility [103]. Thus, a
comprehensive view of AQ effects from transitions to natural gas
must also account for potential worsening of AQ in regions support-
ing gas development, in addition to improvements from sites of
power generation. Considering this, a regional assessment of
increased natural gas use in the Texas power sector accounting for
perturbations at both the generator and production level has
reported net reductions in NOx and SO2 and net increases in VOC
emissions; translating to modest reductions in ozone (0.2 to 0.7 ppb)
and PM2.5 (0.1 to 0.7 mg/m3) [69]. The study concluded that direct
plant emission reductions were capable of offsetting emission
increases at gas production sites. This again should be evaluated in
the context of coal generation offsets, which for the Texas grid, for
example, are significant. Similar impacts may not be observed
depending upon the composition of a region's generator mix, which
highlights again the regional nature of AQ impacts.

PIt should also be considered that the importation of natural gas
may also have different environmental impacts than those from
domestic reserves. While the current availability of domestic gas
averts the need for significant importation (i.e., U.S. natural gas net
imports fell to a record low in 2016 [104]), future demands could
require the U.S. to do so. In fact, the U.S. is likely to become a net
exporter of LNG in coming years [105]. Imported gas has a higher
emission footprint than domestically produced gas due to the addi-
tional life cycle stages required including liquefaction, transport, and
regasification [49]. Often transport is accomplished via ocean trans-
port on LNG tanker ships which are high emitting if operating on
heavy fuel oils [106]. Table 8 demonstrates the emission burdens
associated with the acquisition and transport of domestic and
imported NG. Imported natural gas is assumed to be foreign offshore
gas extraction, followed by liquefaction, ocean transport via LNG
tanker, regasification and pipeline transport to the NGCC facility.
Imported gas is associated with higher emissions of GHG due to
emissions occurring during liquefaction, transport, and regasifica-
tion. Contrastingly, emissions of air pollutants including NOx and
SO2 vary with some domestic pathways having higher associated
emissions. Thus, changes in the origin of natural gas supply may shift
impacts on AQ and GHG.

PThe potential implications of direct methane emissions from the
natural gas system further reduce optimism for from a climate miti-
gation perspective. These concerns are heightened due to current
uncertainty regarding methane emissions from the natural gas sys-
tem [72,107]. Indeed, the rapid rise in production of gas from uncon-
ventional reserves in some ways has exceeded the ability of
researchers to understand and predict potential impacts [53]. This
has led to significant variations and uncertainty in the literature, e.
g., life cycle GHG emission estimates that conflict significantly in
magnitude [22,82,83,85,108(cid:1)110]. If leakage is underreported and/
or increased, direct emissions of methane could even reduce the
expected GHG reductions reported here. This trend has been demon-
strated in recent studies indicating that upstream methane emis-
sions may offset the carbon mitigation potential of natural gas
relative to other fossil fuels [76,111]. To address this, significant
research efforts are underway in the U.S. including a comprehensive
initiative involving 16 independent studies aimed at quantifying and
identifying emissions of methane across all areas of the oil and gas
supply chain [112].
PConversely,

if significant progress is made in controlling and
reducing system-wide methane emissions in the U.S. the carbon
intensity of gas generation may improve. In recent years the U.S. EPA
has taken several regulatory actions aimed at reducing methane emis-
sions from the oil and gas industry including New Source Perfor-
mance Standards from new, reconstructed, and modified sources
[113]. Additionally, the Natural Gas STAR Methane Challenge Program
was launched to encourage U.S. oil and gas companies to make more
specific and transparent commitments to reducing methane emis-
sions [114]. Historical evaluation of EPA programs and policies to
reduce methane emissions demonstrated successful abatement [115].
PHowever, the potential for worsening of ozone and HAP levels at
sites of gas recovery and production should also be considered
alongside the direct emission impacts of natural gas generation.
Unconventional gas recovery also carries other environmental risks
including the high consumption [98] and contamination of fresh
water resources [116,117] including drinking water supplies [118]
with the potential for harmful human health impacts [119]. There-
fore technology lock-in associated with the construction of new nat-
ural gas generation technologies, including advanced NGCC, should
be considered with importance in GHG and AQ mitigation planning.
And the evolution of the natural gas system that should be promoted
by policy must include measures to prevent leakage in upstream
operations, in transmission and distributions systems, and in cus-
tomer-side of the meter and end-use applications. The evolution
could also include substitution of lower global warming potential
(GWP) fuel to lower the impacts of any remaining leakage.

3. Emission reductions from advanced conversion technologies

PEmissions from natural gas generation can be reduced further via
the use of advanced conversion devices. The preceding discussion
was primarily focused on existing technologies used in large,

Pcentralized power plants. However, conversion can be accomplished
with devices that have higher efficiencies and the potential for very
low emissions (cid:1) including advances in NGCC technologies, fuel cells,
micro-turbines, and hybrid fuel cell/heat engine plants [120]. Such
methods can provide pathways for natural gas generation to fulfill
valuable energy services while minimizing emissions (cid:1) including
providing efficient and low-impact generation that can facilitate the
complementary balancing of renewable resources, defer investment
in electrical infrastructure, and/or provide ancillary services to the
grid. Additionally, these devices can operate on natural gas in the
near- to mid-term and renewable fuels and blends in the mid- to
long-term providing a link from fossil to renewable fuel systems. For
example, fuel cells can operate on conventional natural gas, fossil
and renewable hydrogen, and biogas with a flexibility that allows for
important opportunities to reduce emissions.

PAn additional key characteristic for advanced systems includes
the ability to provide CCHP as this attribute displaces the fuel and
emissions that would otherwise be associated with (1) boilers and
furnaces (in the case of using the thermal energy directly as heat),
and (2) the displaced electricity to drive chillers (in the case of using
the thermal energy for cooling) [121]. The resultant effect is to
reduce CO2 emissions, criteria pollutant emissions, and the demand
on fuel reserves. Potential CCHP devices include fuel cells and fuel
cell-heat engine hybrid systems, gas turbines including microtur-
bines, steam turbines, and reciprocating engines. Cost and perfor-
mance parameters for CCHP devices are provided in Table 9. A
detailed overview of CCHP technologies can be found in [35].
Changes can also be made to the paradigm of natural gas electricity
generation, transmission, and distribution with potential for emis-
sions and AQ benefits. A primary example includes transitions from
the centralized model of power generation involving large power
plants located far from population centers requiring electricity
transmission over long distances to distributed generation (DG)
involving electricity production at or near the point-of-use [122]. In
addition to avoiding losses during transmissions, DG benefits include
potentially lower costs, reduced emissions, higher power quality,
reliability, and security [123]. DG also enhances the ability for CCHP
inclusion in system design, e.g., centralized NGCC can also provide
CCHP but are often located far from population centers or other sites
of heating or cooling demand.

3.1. Advanced conversion technologies

PSteam turbines are typically matched to solid fuel boilers, indus-
trial waste heat, or integrated with a gas turbine as a bottoming
cycle to create combined cycles. Typical capacities for steam turbines
range from 50 kW to several hundred MW in large centralized power
plants. Steam turbine benefits include high fuel flexibility, high reli-
ability and equipment lifetime, and flexibility of design. Reciprocat-
ing engines represent a mature and commercially available heat
engine technology that make up over half of existing CCHP systems

Pignition or compression ignition and can range from very small
(0.005 MW) to large (80 MW) systems, although typical CCHP sys-
tems sizes range from 0.005 (cid:1) 10 MW. Benefits of reciprocating
engines include low investment and operating cost, high flexibility,
reliability and availability, high part-load efficiencies, load following
capabilities, and fast start-up times. Drawbacks of reciprocating
engines include the need for regular service due to moving parts,
noisy operation, and elevated emissions of criteria pollutants and
GHGs. Gas turbines have been used for stationary power generation
for many decades and range in size from 500 kW to hundreds of
MW. Typically, for CCHP applications, the most economic size range
is 5-MW to the hundreds of MW-scale [35]. Gas turbines have lower
emissions than other common fossil combustion heat engines but
often still require clean-up or emissions control strategies including
lean pre-mixed combustion and/or SCR to meet permitting require-
ments for continuous operation. Typically gas turbines used as CCHP
are best suited for processes with a need for high temperatures (i.
e., /nbw> steam production) [124]. Microturbines are small (typically
60(cid:1)1000 kilowatt (kW)) gas turbine power plants that can be com-
bined with a bottoming steam turbine cycle or operated as a stand-
alone Brayton cycle. Microturbines and offer the benefits of simple
design, compact size, low vibration and noise, and no required cool-
ing [35]. Downsides of microturbines include high costs, low flexibil-
ity, and low electrical efficiencies, particularly at part load [124].
Typically, relative to NGCC plants, microturbine systems operating
on natural gas must be integrated with CCHP to achieve reductions
in GHG and must be integrated with SCR to achieve very low criteria
pollutant emissions [35,125,126].

PFuel cells represent an advanced conversion technology with the
potential to allow natural gas to be used in energy systems with
very low emissions of GHG and pollutants. Fuel cell systems can
operate on natural gas both directly and indirectly as natural gas can
be converted to hydrogen through steam methane reformation
(SMR). Fuel cells differ fundamentally from combustion in that they
convert fuel chemical energy directly to electricity and heat by elec-
trochemical reactions that are similar in concept to battery electro-
chemical reactions. An overview of fuel cell types and characteristics
is provided in Table 10. Fuel cell systems have been produced using
various materials sets (e.g., solid metal oxides (SOFC), molten carbo-
nates (MCFC), phosphoric acid (PAFC), and proton exchange mem-
branes (PEMFC)) [129] with high electrical efficiencies (up to > 60%)
[130,131] and very low pollutant emissions operating on natural gas
(cid:1) even at the distributed scale [130,132]. Fuel cells are applicable for
CCHP applications and have flexibility with regards to fuel, size, sit-
ing, and application choices [133]. This flexibility allows fuel cell sys-
tems to operate on a range of gaseous fuels, including hydrogen,
natural gas directly, renewable fuels such as biogas and renewable
hydrogen [134], or syngas produced from coal in tandem with CCS
[135]. This flexibility allows for mixtures of fuels to be used with the
particular benefit of facilitating biogas supplementation of natural
gas (or vice versa) and the transition from natural gas to renewable
gaseous fuels of various types.

PThe one step of transforming chemical to electrical energy, as
compared to the multi-step process used by combustion devices of
chemical to thermal to mechanical to electrical, typically results in
high electrical efficiencies for fuel cells via avoided losses at each

Pconversion step. Fuel cell systems have demonstrated electrical effi-
ciencies from 30% to levels exceeding 60% even in the single digit
kW size class range [130,131]. This is substantially higher than elec-
trical efficiencies that can be attained by heat engines at the DG scale
as seen in Table 9. For example, reciprocating engines range from
27(cid:1)41%, steam turbines from 5(cid:1)40%, gas turbines from 24(cid:1)36%,
and microturbines from 22(cid:1)28% [35]. As the amount of CO2 gener-
ated per kWh of electricity produced is inversely proportional to the
electrical efficiency, fuel cells emit less CO2 per kWh of electricity
produced than other electricity generating technologies using the
same fuel. The inclusion of CCHP can increase all DG technology effi-
ciencies substantially, to achieve 55(cid:1)80% [35] and, with a judicious
design, exceeding even 90% (mixed heat and electrical efficiency)
[4]. Furthermore, CO2 can be reasonably recovered from exhaust,
particularly if the anode exhaust is not after-burned with the cath-
ode exhaust, allowing for a further reduction in GHG emissions. This
could also allow fuel cells to be incorporated with natural gas tur-
bine cycles to produce high efficiency, low carbon power [136].

PAn additional distinction of fuel cell systems is the ability to pro-
vide hydrogen fuel as an output when operating on hydrocarbon
fuels. This allows fuel cells to operate as tri-generation systems pro-
ducing electricity, heat, and hydrogen [137]. Incorporating hydrogen
production further increases the energy efficiency of the system and
provides additional energy benefits (cid:1) including the potential produc-
tion of fuel for zero-emission hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles. An
important pathway for GHG and AQ co-benefits includes the opera-
tion of tri-generation fuel cell systems on biogas as this allows for a
means of coupling very low or even net negative emission strategies
in the power generation sector to the transportation sector [138].

PHybrid fuel cell-heat engine plants integrate a high temperature
fuel cell (SOFC or MCFC) with a heat engine (e.g., gas turbine, recip-
rocating engine) to achieve even higher efficiency than a fuel cell
alone (converting fuel cell heat to useful work) [139]. A basic sche-
matic is provided in Fig. 2 for a hybrid fuel cell gas-turbine system.
By utilizing energy synergies between the fuel cell and heat engine
(e.g., fuel cell waste heat is turned into useful electrical work and
compression power, and higher pressure operation increases fuel
cell electricity production efficiency) enhanced performance is
achieved. These emerging power plants are being developed by sev-
eral manufacturers and have been shown to achieve very high elec-
trical efficiencies [140(cid:1)142] with ultra-low emissions even at

Pdistributed power sizes [140], and with dynamic dispatch character-
istics [141,143].

PHowever, fuel cell technologies face challenges for complete
commercialization. High initial investment and installation costs
must be reduced in order for fuel cells to compete with strong mar-
ket competition from other CCHP technologies [144]. Specifically,
the cost of fuel cell systems and components must be reduced [145].
Fundamental improvements are also needed to address reliability,
durability, and fuel supply concerns to effectively permit expanded
use of fuel cells [146]. High temperature fuel cells, including many of
those suitable for the services discussed here, are limited by materi-
als requirements, mechanical issues, reliability concerns, and techni-
issues such as thermal expansion matching [131]. Low
cal
temperature fuel cells also face materials and durability concerns
[147]. Therefore, while fuel cells offer a generation pathway for nat-
ural gas with high environmental benefits, progress is needed in
techno-economic areas to facilitate wide-spread adoption.

3.2. Advanced conversion device emissions

PTable 11 shows emissions for five commercially available turbine
systems both with and without SCR and CO oxidation ranging from
3 to 45 MW that have been compiled from vendor data [32]. At the
DG scale, gas turbine systems have the potential for emission reduc-
tions from coal generation with or without the addition of CCHP.
Additionally, the use of CCHP achieves additional reductions in CO2
via offset of natural gas boiler operation necessary to provide equiv-
alent heat.

PDue to the electrochemical reactions fuel cells can reduce criteria
pollutants (compared to the high temperature combustion of fuel in
air) and due to the high electrical efficiency of fuel cells (especially
compared to heat engines in the DG size class and including CCHP)
they can also reduce GHG emissions [132]. The primary electricity
generation process of fuel cells does not mix fuel with air and keeps
temperatures low resulting in criteria pollutant emissions that are
extremely low and, if the fuel input is hydrogen, only water vapor is
produced in the exhaust. If the fuel is natural gas or another hydro-
carbon fuel, the fuel processing subsystem required to facilitate elec-
trochemical reactions in high temperature fuel cells is the sole
source of CO2 that is emitted along with very low levels of criteria
pollutants [35]. Fuel cell system operation on biogas results in near
net zero emission of carbon and fuel cell operation on renewable
hydrogen (e.g., produced through renewable electrolysis) results in
zero emission of carbon. Emissions of CO2 from high temperature
fuel cells operating directly on natural gas are significantly lower

Pthan current and advanced coal technologies and current simple
cycle natural gas turbines with or without the additional emission
reductions from CCHP (Fig. 3). Relative to NGCC plants, SOFC can
provide a reduction without the use of CCHP while PAFC and MCFC
achieve a reduction from NGCC plants if CCHP is included. Advanced
MCFC systems that include two fuel cell stacks in one system can
achieve performance that is comparable to the SOFC performance
shown in Fig. 3.4 Similarly, Fig. 4 displays the emissions of NOx per
kWh for both traditional and advanced heat engines using coal and
natural gas, and stationary fuel cells operating on natural gas. Fuel
cell conversion results in negligible emissions relative to other gen-
eration technologies including very low emissions of NOx and CO,
and negligible SOx and PM [35,148]. Fuel cells achieve comparable or
reduced CO2 emissions compared to NGCC, and significantly reduced
pollutant emissions, even at the distributed scale and without any
after-treatment or other emissions control devices. If CO2 capture is
included GHG benefits from fuel cells would further increase.

PFig. 5 displays the CO2 and NOx emissions of CCHP technologies
relative to the NGCC described in Reference [49]. With appropriately
designed and operated systems, including emissions control tech-
nologies, CCHP devices can provide lower emission rates than cur-
rent natural gas generation. Emissions of NOx from fuel cells are
significantly lower than all other options and require no emission

4.1. Renewable electricity

PTechnologies comprising renewable pathways are diverse and
wide ranges are reported for different indicators including cost, per-
formance, and environmental impact [151]. In general, renewable
technologies have higher associated costs and lower power densities
than current fossil fuels and many, including wind and solar, are
inherently variable (diurnally, seasonally) requiring the co-deploy-
ment of complementary technologies to achieve acceptable sys-
tems-level dynamics (balancing of generation with fluctuations in
load demand) [150,152,153]. Many locations with high resource
potential are not adjacent to population centers, necessitating
upgrade of existing and/or construction of new transmission infra-
structure [154,155]. Due to these and other challenges, dramatically
increasing the capacity of renewable power could require changes to
current U.S. electrical grids to appropriately manage the intermit-
tency, spatial distribution, and scalability of resources [16,54,156], e.
g., requiring increased installed capacities, transmission infrastruc-
ture, and energy storage [11].

PHydropower is a mature technology that is associated with low
emissions of GHG and criteria pollutants in operation [41]. Emissions
from hydropower plant construction and lifetime are known to be
much lower than those from fossil fuel power plants, although habi-
tat impacts and direct GHG emissions from the degradation of bio-
genic carbon and reduced CO2 uptake in hydropower reservoirs is
important to consider [43]. For example, methane emissions from
water storage reservoirs serving hydroelectric generators may result
in a higher carbon footprint for hydropower than previously thought
[157]. When reservoir emissions are included the global average
emissions from hydropower are estimated to be 85 gCO2/kWh and
3 gCH4/kWh with a multiplicative uncertainty factor of 2 [158].
Constructing additional large-scale domestic hydropower plants is
limited by high costs, siting limitations, habitat and other environ-
mental impacts [159,160]. Therefore, typically small hydropower
plants, often utilizing run-of-the-river approaches, are considered
for renewable resource expansion in the U.S. with no harmful AQ
impacts likely from such projects [161].

(e.g., m-Si), although prospective advances

PPower generation from solar energy commonly includes both
photovoltaic (PV) and various forms of concentrated solar power
(CSP). Estimates of the GHG intensity of solar PV electricity are
reported in the range of 19(cid:1)95 g CO2eq/kWh for various thin film
PVs (e.g., CdTe, a-Si, CIS) and 20(cid:1)104 g CO2eq/kWh for crystalline
technologies
in
manufacturing could reduce emissions [43,50,162(cid:1)172]. A critical
review of the literature reported a range of 1(cid:1)218 g CO2eq/kWh
with a mean value of 49.91 g CO2eq/kWh [173]. Emissions vary with
respect to characteristics of individual technologies (e.g., achieved
efficiencies, required manufacturing processes) and regional deploy-
ment (e.g., insolation, meteorology) which impact total emissions
and power output. Though life cycle emissions for PV are among the
highest for renewable technologies the bulk of reported values are
considerably lower than any coal or natural gas technology. Though
less information is available for CSP, studies have reported a range of
12(cid:1)284 g CO2e/kWh for various technologies with values in the
upper range representing facilities incorporating natural gas-fired
complimentary generation [174(cid:1)179]. Highlighting the impact of
any gas generation to total emissions, studies reported a range of
30(cid:1)149 g CO2e/kWh for parabolic trough technology when 3(cid:1)25%
natural gas back up was considered and 26(cid:1)28 g CO2e/kWh for solar
only processes [178,180]. Life cycle emissions for a 50 MW trough
plant with 7.5 hours of TES were reported at 33 g CO2e/kWh [177],
which is similar to the reference plant design in [178]. Life cycle
GHG emissions for CSP technologies are impacted by plant design,
including utilized cooling technologies, fuel and operating character-
istics of any backup generation, and heat transfer medium [178].
Despite having life cycle emissions in the higher range for

rent NGCC plant. Data for NGCC from Reference [49], Data for CCHP technologies from

Pcontrol device or strategy [35]. Gas turbine NOx emissions have a
large range but typical commercial systems generate 0.07 to
0.11 g/kWhr with lean premixed burners and the inclusion of SCR
can further reduce emissions by 80 to 90% [35]. Microturbines oper-
ating on natural gas can achieve low NOx emissions with lean pre-
mixed combustion at full load [35]. However, emissions commonly
increase during operation at part load with implications for comple-
mentary generation or dynamic operation to support distributed
loads. Reciprocating engines have the potential for high emissions,
including NOx, depending upon the type of engine used. Smaller
scale engines utilizing rich burn combustion and catalytic after treat-
ment can emit 0.027 g/kWh while larger lean burn systems may
emit 0.36 g/kWhr in the absence of SCR. Steam turbine emissions
depend directly on fuel choice with natural gas systems ranging sig-
nificantly. With CCHP, combustion devices in DG applications could
provide a GHG and AQ benefit via reduced emissions of both CO2
and NOx. Contrastingly, fuel cells with CCHP achieve significant
reductions in emissions from all combustion devices without the
need for post-conversion emission control strategies.

4. Low-carbon generation options

PA diverse range of generation strategies exist that offer the
potential for meeting future electricity demands in tandem with
reduced emissions. Low-carbon generation technologies and fuels
include renewable energy resources such as wind, solar, geothermal,
ocean, hydropower, and biopower, nuclear energy, and fossil genera-
tion equipped with CCS. Methods to reduce electricity demand via
improvements in the efficiency of power generation, transmission,
distribution and end-use of electricity can result in less primary gen-
eration; lowering total fuel consumption and reducing emissions
while meeting demands. Moreover, many studies have demon-
strated that no one technology can provide the necessary reductions,
and that a portfolio of low-carbon strategies will be required to meet
climate goals [11,149,150]. The following section presents a brief
review of the literature regarding the emissions and potential AQ
impacts of additional low-carbon generation strategies including
renewable pathways, nuclear, and CCS. While additional options
exist, those selected for review herein are commonly considered for
GHG mitigation, are currently at or near technological maturity lev-
els portending significant potential expansion in capacity in the
short- to mid-term, and are supported by a depth of available litera-
ture regarding impacts.

Prenewables, particularly if gas-fired backup is utilized, CSP emissions
are roughly 3 to 7% of gas- and coal-fired generation [55].

PDeployment of solar PV and CSP is not expected to have any neg-
ative AQ impacts directly. Solar power technologies lack point-of-
use pollutant emissions and life cycle pollutant emissions are largely
determined by manufacturing, transport and installation processes,
including the technologies used to meet energy demands of these
parts of the life cycle [56]. Rates of SO2 emissions for PV installations
in the U.S. have been reported to vary from 158 to 540 mg/kWh
across different technologies [56]. A review of PV production data
from 2004 to 2006 from four major commercial PV types (multicrys-
talline silicon, monocrystalline silicon, ribbon silicon, and thin-film
cadmium telluride) reported a range of SO2 emissions from 0.158 to
0.378 g/kWh [167]. Life cycle emissions of NOx for PV technologies
are reflected by the grid mix of utilized energy in material produc-
tion and have been estimated to total between 0.040 to 0.26 g/kWh
[56,167]. A review of 5 life cycle assessments (LCA) for PM emissions
associated with PV electricity generation in the U.S. found only one
that was greater than 100 mg/kWh, reported to be 0.610 g/kWh [56].
Estimates in the upper range represented an area with low insola-
tion rates and a greater reliance on coal for electricity generation,
and regions with more favorable solar resources or cleaner electrical
grids have lower emissions. It is estimated that a minimum of
89(cid:1)98% of air emissions (GHGs, criteria pollutants, heavy metals,
and radioactive species) associated with electricity generation could
be avoided if electricity generated from PV replaces average grid
electricity [167]. Localized impacts are possible if PV manufacturing
facilities are located in urban air sheds and emissions from industry
related activities should be considered. However, the majority of
current global production occurs outside of the U.S. [181]. Life cycle
emissions are reduced when PV is manufactured close to the point
of deployment, with estimates in the literature suggesting that emis-
sions from transport of PV panels to site locations represents a sig-
nificant contribution [182,183]. While it is possible that natural gas
back-up generation integrated into some CSP plants could produce
direct emissions, the spatial and temporal operation of such facilities
reduce the potential for worsening of urban AQ. Areas with high CSP
potential are often in remote locations and many current and pro-
posed CSP facilities are located far from population centers.

PConversion of wind energy into electricity through devices
including wind turbines is well recognized as an environmentally
beneficial source of power [184]. Wind power has the technical
potential to contribute large amounts of electricity to the future U.S.
grid [10,16,185] and could off-set substantial amounts of CO2 emis-
sions [150]. On the other hand, wind power is one of the most unpre-
intermittent and highly dynamic of
dictable, uncontrollable,
renewable resources [186]. Thus, wind power requires complemen-
tary storage and dispatchable technologies to handle large amounts
of wind penetration. Wind generated electricity entails very low
GHG emissions with estimates for wind turbines ranging from 3(cid:1)40
and 3(cid:1)22 CO2e/kWh for onshore [41,50,187(cid:1)194] and off-shore
[170,187,189,194(cid:1)197] respectively, although turbine technology
improvements could further reduce net emissions. Life cycle emis-
sions are site specific and dependent on many factors including tur-
bine size, wind conditions, and turbine lifetime. Relative to an
average value for fossil energy generation, total avoided GHG emis-
sions have been estimated at 35,265 and 122,961 tons for a 850 kW
and 3.0 MW turbine over a 20-year service life, respectively [188].
Pollutant emissions associated with life cycle stages of wind power
are also amongst the lowest of assessed technologies, estimated to
total less than 100 mg/kWh for SO2, NOx, and PM [56]. No large-scale
emissions of HAPs or other compounds of concern have been
reported for wind turbine manufacturing or installment. Studies of
high levels of wind power deployment have also reported important
reductions in total NOx and SO2 [39] and wind farms have been esti-
mated to reduce SO2, NOx and PM2.5 from natural gas power plants

P[198]. It has been estimated that wind power has the ability to pro-
vide significant human health benefits from reductions in ambient
PM2.5 levels [198]. The ability to provide utility-scale power with
very low emissions yields significant GHG and AQ mitigation poten-
tial and justification of wind-related government subsidies often site
the societal benefits of reducing air pollution [199].

PConventional geothermal is a commercially proven technology
that can be used for power generation, heat pumps, or other direct
uses. Three major conventional geothermal technologies utilized to
provide power include dry/direct steam plants, flash steam plants,
and binary-cycle plants. Additionally, enhanced geothermal systems
(EGS), involving the use of advanced drilling and fluid injection
methods to add water and permeability in locations where heat is
available, could increase potential resource availability. Life cycle
emissions for all geothermal generation forms are reduced from coal
and gas [200]. Estimates range from 5(cid:1)57 g CO2e/kWh for various
plant designs [50,193,201,202]. Some hydrothermal reservoirs con-
tain trace amounts of dissolved GHGs which are released to the
atmosphere from direct and flash steam geothermal plants [203].
Though emissions of lithospheric CO2 can be significant; emissions
vary widely with respect to particular geothermal fields and average
emissions are still much lower than any fossil energy source (see
Table 12). Binary-cycle plants utilize a closed loop cycle and lack air
emissions. An estimate of CO2 emissions from geothermal power,
including all stages from plant construction to decommissioning,
reported emissions of 5.6 g CO2/kWh, however the value did not
include emissions associated with operation, which have been esti-
mated to be about 30 g CO2/kWh [193]. Fugitive CO2 emissions are
also a concern; however a study of emissions from hot dry-rock geo-
thermal electricity calculated a CO2 emissions factor of 37.8 g CO2/
kWh including fugitive emissions [170]. Direct pollutant emissions
from geothermal generation, including NOx and SO2, are low com-
pared to fossil generation and expansion of geothermal power is not
expected to be associated with any AQ concerns [200]. Indeed, geo-
thermal power has been shown to provide significant reductions in
air emissions relative to coal and natural gas [204]. Previous AQ con-
cerns caused by hydrogen sulfide emissions associated with geother-
mal generation have been successfully mitigated by commercially
available control technologies. It is expected that geothermal tech-
nology will move away from hydrothermal towards larger EGS
developments which have reduced environmental risks. Geothermal
power derived from closed loop binary-cycle plants produce no air
emissions of criteria pollutants and can be considered a direct emis-
sions free source of electricity.

PGeneration pathways with fuels derived from biomass sources
(i.e., organic material produced by a biological process) are an attrac-
tive renewable option due in part to the flexibility of energy provi-
sion, which includes many different feedstocks with opportunities
and availabilities across a broad range of geographic areas [205]. Pro-
spective resources include wood and woody wastes, trees, plants,
grasses, aquatic plants and algae, agricultural residues, industrial
wastes, sewage sludge, animal wastes, organic waste materials and
municipal solid wastes (MSW) [206]. A key distinction differentiates
dedicated energy crops (DEC) grown intentionally for use as an

Penergy resource from those available in waste or residue streams.
Biomass-derived gasses (biogas) with energy potential can be pro-
duced via intentional or unintentional aerobic or anaerobic digestion
or fermentation of biodegradable organic matter including manure,
sewage sludge, and MSW [207]. Major sources of available waste
streams suitable for digestion include wastewater treatment plants
(WWTP), agricultural activities, and industrial wastes. Biogases
range in composition, but generally are 50(cid:1)80% methane, with CO2
largely providing the balance, and have significant energy value
[208]. Additionally, small amounts of nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen
sulfide and a variety of organic and element-organic compounds are
present which can lead to emissions of criteria pollutants and HAP
depending on chosen conversion device [209].

PFundamental generation strategies include direct combustion,
co-firing, gasification, and pyrolysis. Current biopower systems most
often include direct combustion of resources, e.g., solid biomass
combustion for heat to produce high-pressure steam which is
expanded through a generation turbine [210]. Feedstocks can be co-
fired with fossil fuels in traditional power plants, displacing some
fraction of the original fossil generation, e.g., solid biomass co-firing
with coal, biogas co-firing with natural gas [211]. Gasification has
been proposed as a method for effectively converting biomass into a
useful fuel for power generation, CCHP applications, hydrogen pro-
duction, and liquid fuel production [212]. Gasification differs from
combustion in that solid fuels are partially oxidized in an oxygen
starved environment at high temperatures to produce carbon char,
and a flexible fuel gas composed of hydrogen, CO, CO2, and methane
[213]. Differing from gasification, pyrolysis is conducted around
500°C without any oxygen and can produce solid (char), liquid (tar),
and gas products [213]. Gasification pathways can improve genera-
tion by employing gas-Brayton cycles in higher efficiency turbine
engines, e.g., applications of biomass integrated gasification (BIGCC)
in gas-turbine plants, but are currently limited by cost and require
further development and demonstration at commercial scale [214].
Similarly, biogas fuels are often utilized directly as a fuel for combus-
tion with common technologies including reciprocating engines and
turbines. Additional conversion devices for biogas are the same as
those for natural gas, and include direct chemical conversion via fuel
cells [207]. Common conversion devices (e.g., reciprocating engines)
are commercially available at the distributed and utility-scale, but
generally entail lower efficiencies and higher pollutant emissions
[215]. Gaseous fuels can also be upgraded and injected into existing
natural gas pipelines to provide a source of renewable methane
which can be utilized flexibly in numerous applications [216,217].

PLife cycle GHG assessments conducted for biopower using
biomass waste residues, DECs reported reductions in GWP from
coal and NGCC plants, including the potential for net negative
emissions [218]. Co-firing with coal reduces CO2 emissions rela-
tive to firing with coal alone, but not compared to NGCC, and
could be an effective near
term GHG mitigation strategy
[219,220], particularly if advanced coal technologies are utilized
Impacts for DEC are difficult to interpret as required
[221].
changes in land- and water resource-use affect a variety of com-
plex sequences including food resources, hydrologic cycles, bio-
diversity, emissions
from upstream processes, and others,
leading to dramatic variation in GHG estimates even for the
same DEC [222]. Biomass residue is preferable to DEC in terms of
net energy ratio and GHG emissions across feedstock and conver-
sion technology pathways [218,223]. Feedstocks derived from
waste/residue streams can achieve substantial GHG reductions
via offset of traditional waste management practices that can
result in emissions of gasses with higher GWP than CO2 includ-
ing methane and N2O, e.g., avoidance of methane via decomposi-
tion and/or treatment of feedstocks. Very low GHG emissions for
woody biomass relative to fossil generation have been reported
using a dynamic LCA approach, however biomass pathway

Pemissions were higher than other renewable sources [170]. Still,
pathways with appropriately selected DECs grown on specific
land categories have the potential to sequester carbon [224,225].
The use of some DECs, including food crops, limit GHG benefits
and greater reductions are attained from waste products or low-
input, high diversity perennial plants grown on degraded or mar-
ginal lands [226,227]. In light of these and other environmental
concerns associated with DECs (land-use, water resources, soil,
aquatic toxicity, competition with food, etc.), it has been pro-
posed that only certain feedstocks be considered for renewable
biopower including perennial plants grown on degraded lands
abandoned from agricultural use, crop residues, sustainably har-
vested wood and forest residues, double crops/mixed cropping
systems, and municipal and industrial wastes [228].

[229]. For example,

PBiogas generation pathways (e.g.,

the treatment of animal
manure using anaerobic digestion, collection and utilization of land-
fill gas) can dramatically reduce GHG via offset of the direct release
of methane and other emissions and demand for grid electricity and
process heat, displacing emissions from conventional energy path-
ways. The environmental impact from biogas systems is beneficial
on a life cycle basis, with indirect environmental benefits (e.g.,
reduced emissions of ammonia (NH3) and methane) sometimes in
excess of direct benefits (e.g., reduced emissions of CO2 and pollu-
tants from biogas conversion)
traditional
manure disposal methods (e.g., lagoons, outdoor storage) generate
and emit methane and N2O during the decomposition process. Simi-
larly, landfill gas is comprised of 50(cid:1)80% methane and the utiliza-
tion via the installation of conversion technologies, largely as a
result of regulations addressing recovery for flaring or energy use,
has resulted in significant GHG emission reductions in the U.S. [230].
Emissions from biogas energy pathways vary significantly depend-
ing on properties of digested raw material, efficiency and character-
istics of gas production, deployed end-use technology, efficiency of
generation (electricity and thermal), and others, including the utili-
zation of by-product heat [231]. The fuel-cycle emissions from bio-
gas systems can vary by a factor of 3(cid:1)4, and even by up to 11, for
different systems providing equivalent energy [232]. A major deter-
minant of GHG emissions from biogas systems are any emissions of
methane due to leakage or venting, which if present, can add sub-
stantial warming potential [232]. Emphasizing the carbon mitigation
potential of biogas fuels, Fig. 6 shows carbon intensities of CNG pro-
duced from biogas pathways relative to domestic fossil resources
including high solids anaerobic digestion, animal waste, WWTP,
and landfill production methods. The ability to offset the release of
methane allows all biogas pathways to achieve net negative carbon

Pintensities, although it should be noted that values do not include
emissions from the point-of-conversion.
PTable 13 provides a summary of

life cycle GHG emissions
reported for a range of biopower pathways. The potential for offset
from waste stream resources results in the possibility of very low to
even net-negative emissions depending on the resource and conver-
sion pathway. The results also highlight the significant variation pos-
sible with DEC, potentially resulting in emissions at
levels
comparable to advanced natural gas generation and with other envi-
ronmental concerns. Therefore, DEC biopower pathways must be
developed carefully to achieve GHG and AQ benefits.

PBiopower is distinct from other renewable resources in that some
pathways (e.g., combustion and gasification) have direct pollutant
emissions including PM, CO, VOC, NOx, SOx, acid gasses, and heavy
metals comparable to or in excess of natural gas generation. Pollut-
ant emissions generated per unit energy are relate directly to the
specific pathway and vary with respect to consumed feedstock,
utilized conversion technology, the use of co-deployed pollutant
controls, and others. Variation in resource types, characteristics (e.g.,
energy, ash, and moisture content), utilized conversion technologies,
and end-uses yield a range of generated emissions. Direct pollutant
emissions from conventional solid biomass combustion are gener-
ally favorable to coal, but often higher
than natural gas.
[218,253(cid:1)255]. Biopower pathways with fluidized bed or gasifica-
tion emit NOx similar to NGCC plants, however emissions are higher
if SCR is used in NGCC [218,219,256]. In addition to direct facility
emissions, upstream emissions occur as a result of activities required
to produce, process, and transport feedstock to facility locations
[257]. When emissions are considered over a life cycle, species-level
increases and decreases are observed relative to conventional fossil
generation [218,258,259]. However,
the
regional nature of AQ dictates spatial and temporal emission pat-
terns as the determinants of impacts and biopower systems require
evaluation on a site-specific basis, rather than solely a life cycle
approach. Introducing a biopower facility results in the introduction
of an emissions source into a region which could have detrimental
impacts on regional- and local-scale PM and ozone concentrations,
as well as levels of HAP. For assessment of regional AQ impacts it is
also necessary to develop an understanding spatially and temporally
for emissions both directly from source contributors (e.g., exhaust of
conversion devices, machinery used to collect/transport feedstock)
and from those avoided (e.g., decomposition, flaring) in entirety.
Therefore, biopower systems can have multi-faceted impacts on
emissions and AQ when compared to reference fossil systems.

in contrast

to GHGs,

PWith similarity to natural gas, advanced conversion devices can
support biomass and biogas fuel pathways. The most common tech-
nology for power generation of biogas resources currently is a recip-
rocating engine, largely due to lowest costs. However, the high
emissions associated with such devices can cause difficulties meet-
ing permitting requirements [260]. In particular, the use of fuel cells
to directly convert chemical energy from biogas resources into
power, heat, and fuels represents an opportunity to reduce emis-
sions [261]. Suitable gaseous fuels include biogases and syngas

Pproduced from gasification of solid biomass. In addition to low emis-
sions, benefits of using biogas in high temperature fuel cells include
high electrical efficiencies, water neutrality, and the generation of
multiple useful products via tri-generation systems (e.g., waste heat,
industrial steam, hydrogen) [262]. Fuel cells have been demon-
strated with landfill gas [263,264], anaerobic digester gas from
municipal WWTPs [265] and agricultural wastes [262]. However,
the use of biogas in high temperature fuel cells requires additional
considerations with a notable example being the clean-up of fuel
contaminants which can degrade key components of fuel cells
including the stack and fuel reformer, even at trace levels [266].
The cost of clean-up can represent a significant portion of overall
cost from such systems [267]. Advances in the materials science of
adsorption systems are needed to develop cost-effective purifica-
tion of biogas including reducing reactor volumes within systems
[266]. Other advanced conversion technologies suitable for biogas
applications that offer potentially improved environmental perfor-
mance include Stirling engines, organic Rankine cycle, and micro
gas turbines [231].

4.2. Nuclear power

PNuclear power is the largest current source of domestic low-car-
bon power by a wide margin [29]. Electricity generated via nuclear
processes is a proven, readily available generation strategy which
requires no further technological advances prior to large-scale
deployment and has reasonable economic competitiveness relative
to fossil fuels and the other mitigation options considered [268,269].
However, considerable barriers exist to expansion of nuclear capac-
ity including initial investment costs, lack of waste disposal pro-
grams, weapons proliferation concerns, and, perhaps most
prominently, societal concerns regarding the safety of nuclear
energy leading to social opposition to existing and planned nuclear
plant operation [270,271]. Advanced nuclear technologies offer the
potential for improved safety and security, and reduced cost and
waste generation. Third- and fourth- generation reactor designs
could alleviate challenges associated with nuclear power including
generating little to no long-lived waste, lower life cycle GHG emis-
sions, lower capital costs for plant construction, and no production
of weapons grade material [55]. A complete description of different
advanced nuclear fuel cycles is outside the scope of this work and a
detailed overview can be found in References [55,272].

PNuclear generation produces electricity with very low life cycle
GHG emissions relative to coal power plants [55]. Estimates vary
with respect to specific plant types and fuel cycles but are consis-
tently reported as comparable to some renewable technologies, and
1 to 2 orders of magnitude lower than fossil technologies (see
Table 14) [273]. A comprehensive review reported a central value
for the carbon intensity of nuclear energy of 10 g CO2eq/kWh with
an uncertainty range of 5 to 17 g CO2eq/kWh [274]. An assess-
ment of 103 life cycle studies reported a mean value of 66 g
CO2eq/kWh with the bulk of GHG emissions occurring upstream
of
the operational stage [166,275]. Additional studies have
shown a range of carbon intensities with values as low as 1.4

Pand as high as 288 g CO2eq/kWh [41,43,44,50,166,273,275(cid:1)282].
A subset of reported values and the reduction from both average
coal and gas generation is provided in Table 14. Variation gener-
ally results from different enrichment methods and fuel cycles
(e.g., once-through vs. recycled) and the carbon intensity of elec-
tricity used during various life cycle stages. Differences can be
attributed to assumptions regarding the carbon intensity of the
regional power grid, deployed enrichment path (e.g., centrifuga-
tion vs. diffusion), and chosen LCA methodology [279].
In
response to uncertainty in reported emissions, Nian et al., (2014)
proposed a value of 22.8 g CO2eq/kWh using a new LCA method-
ology, roughly 2.5% from the median of globally reported LCA
results [283]. It should be noted that even when considering the
higher range of reported values nuclear power offers consider-
ably lower GHG emissions than any other fossil option, including
advanced coal and natural gas technologies.

PNuclear generation is devoid of direct pollutant emissions (cid:1)
though emissions occur from up- and down-stream life cycle stages
including construction, fuel enrichment and transportation, and
others. However, the magnitude of indirect emissions is comparable
to those from renewables and the avoidance of direct emissions
could significantly improve AQ, particularly in the displacement of
current or new coal-fired capacity [34]. Reported life cycle pollutant
emissions for a nuclear power plant are significantly lower than coal
and natural gas [287]. Using the estimates for coal power from [54],
nuclear power offers reductions of 95 to > 99% in SO2, and 80% to
>99% in NOx for conventional and advanced coal generation. In addi-
tion, nuclear power can achieve emission benefits relative to gas-
fired plants, e.g., reductions in NOx of 86% to 96% [54]. Similarly,
reported PM2.5 emissions for nuclear plants are approximate to a
reduction of 54 to 68% from natural gas and over four orders of mag-
nitude less than coal [54].

PReductions in precursor emissions from coal and natural gas gen-
eration support the conclusion that increasing capacities of nuclear
power would contribute to reductions in ground-level concentra-
tions of primary and secondary pollutants. With similarity to GHG
impacts, contributions to regional AQ improvements would be maxi-
mized by the displacement of coal generation. However, even the
offset of natural gas generation could offer GHG and AQ co-benefits
due to the low embodied emissions associated with nuclear energy.
A factor that should be considered is the spatial discrepancy in life
cycle emission profiles for nuclear relative to fossil which could have
implications for AQ impacts, e.g., in regions supporting uranium
mining or enrichment. Though a lack of robust modeling studies pre-
vents an accurate quantification of impacts on ozone and PM2.5,
replacing coal and gas in many regions of the U.S. would likely be
beneficial to both. The importance of GHG and AQ improvements
achieved through nuclear power have been demonstrated via
human health impact assessments [288]. Using historical produc-
tion and global projection data; it is estimated that replacing fos-
sil fuel combustion with nuclear power has prevented an average
of 1.84 million air pollution-related deaths and could prevent up
to 7.04 million deaths by 2050 [289]. In addition, achieved GHG
emission savings are estimated to be 64 gigatonnes (Gt) CO2-eq
with reductions potentially rising to 240 Gt CO2-eq by 2050.
Notably, a transition to natural gas may not mitigate climate
concerns and could result in more air pollution-related human
mortality events compared to nuclear power [289].

4.3. Carbon capture and storage (CCS)

PCCS involves the separation, removal, transport, and storage of
CO2 from energy-related processes in appropriate sinks including
deep saline formations, depleted oil and gas reservoirs, un-minable
coal beds, shale basins, and others. Potential opportunities for CCS
deployment include large fossil fuel energy facilities (e.g., coal- or

Pgas-fired power plants), biomass energy facilities, major industrial
sources (e.g., cement production facilities), synthetic fuel plants, and
fossil-based hydrogen production facilities. A full review of the tech-
nologies, processes, and challenges associated with CCS is outside
the scope of this work and can be found in [40,290,291]. Interest in
CCS strategies often stems from the fact that large-scale deployment
could facilitate GHG mitigation in tandem with the continued use of
coal as it is cost-effective with large, proven domestic reserves
[290,292]. Given the projected growth of fossil generation to meet
increasing regional power demands [29], CCS has been acknowl-
edged as an important technology in decarbonizing the U.S. power
system [290]. Indeed deep GHG reductions may only be achieved if
existing coal and gas plants are retrofitted with CCS technologies or
retired [10].

PCurrent CCS technology has the ability to capture approximately
80(cid:1)90% of CO2 produced during generation with the IPCC reporting
85% reductions in CO2 per kWh for new PC or NGCC plants [293].
This value assumes secure storage with no leakage compared to a
plant without CCS [149]. CCS processes are energy intensive necessi-
tating additional fuel consumption for equivalent electrical output
relative to a facility not equipped with CCS. This results in additional
emissions of CO2 and pollutants (essentially the energy used repre-
sents a loss in net efficiency of the plant) (cid:1) although additional CO2
is also captured with 90% efficiency [294]. Decreased efficiencies
vary across technologies including NGCC (¡11(cid:1)22%), pulverized
coal (¡24(cid:1)40%), and IGCC (¡14(cid:1)25%) plants [295]. Advanced tech-
nologies can reduce efficiency penalties and provide the potential
for synergies. IGCC integration with CCS is technically attractive as
CO2 can be captured prior to combustion, with the concentration of
the CO2 in the syngas produced during gasification ranging from 30%
to 32% allowing for more efficient collection [296]. Therefore, the
net impacts of CCS must account for the efficiency penalty, capture
efficiency, and additional life cycle emissions including leakage dur-
ing storage. Studies have indicated that fugitive emissions and un-
captured indirect emissions could be substantial (cid:1) about 10% of
combustion emissions [149]. Using this value and assuming 30%
more fuel is required, 90% capture of emissions is then equivalent to
a net CO2 emissions reduction of 76% from a given source. Also, fuel
cell technologies that use hydrogen from fossil fuels that used CCS
and integrated gasification fuel cell (IGFC) cycles have shown very
high fuel-to-electricity conversion efficiency and low to zero effi-
ciency penalty compared to systems without CCS [135].

PA summary table of CO2 emission impacts reported in the litera-
ture is provided in Table 15. The effectiveness of CCS varies with
regard to specific plant configurations and fuels. For a 90% CO2 cap-
ture efficiency GHG emissions are reduced by 75(cid:1)84%, with IGCC
technology favorable to NGCC [46]. However, despite reduced CCS
performance, NGCC plants continue to have lower life cycle GHG
emissions compared to traditional coal-fired technologies due the
reduced carbon content of natural gas and higher net plant efficien-
cies [297]. Studies examining PC plants with CCS have demonstrated
71% decreases in GWP and up to a 79% GHG emissions reduction for
PC utilizing lignite coal [252,297,298]. A review of PC coal-fired
plants with post-combustion capture reported life cycle emissions
from 79 to 275 gCO2eq/KWh, relative to a range of 690 to 1100
gCO2eq/kWh without CCS [299]. For IGCC plants with pre-combus-
tion CCS, reported emissions ranged from 110 to 181 g CO2eq/kWh
versus 666 to 870 g CO2eq/KWh for plants lacking capture. Oxyfuel
power plants with CCS are reported to have life cycle emissions
between 25 and 176 g CO2eq/kWh. NGCC installing post-combustion
capture are reported to have emissions ranging from 75 to 245 g
CO2eq/KWh with a reduction from non-capture plants of 51 to
80% [46,252]. The estimates at the lower range result from assump-
tions regarding emissions occurring during upstream fuel extraction,
production, and transport (e.g., methane leakage) which could
potentially lessen the benefits of natural gas CCS application. This

Pcould be particularly relevant if, as discussed previously, non-con-
ventional gas sources continue to meet a growing portion of domes-
tic gas reserves. High estimates for coal-fired power are similar to
advanced NGCC without capture, demonstrating the mitigation
potential of CCS if coal continues to meet an important fraction of
the domestic energy mix.

PShown in Table 15, equipping different plant technologies with
CCS can both increase and decrease levels of emitted pollutant spe-
cies by different mechanisms, and impacts must be considered by
specific technology, fuel, and pollutant species. With similarity to
GHG, additional pollutant emissions are generated from efficiency
penalties associated with energy required for CCS processes includ-
ing SO2, NOx, VOC, and PM (cid:1) although such emissions are subjected
to installed control technologies. Thus, most emission rates of pollu-
tants (i.e., emissions per unit primary energy input) are expected
to remain equal or be reduced by other mechanisms. However,
increases in total pollutant emissions (i.e., emissions per electricity
output) could result from increased total energy input [304]. The
increase in total emissions for all pollutants could be assumed to be
approximately proportional to the efficiency penalty associated with
a given CCS technology. This could mean for example, that emissions
of NOx may not increase from an individual power plant but increase
from the power generation sector as a whole via reduced efficiencies
across the power plant fleet [300]. Note that fuel cell technologies
that include CCS are particularly attractive from both a GHG and AQ
emissions perspective, due in-part to the fundamental difference of
fuel cell technology which maintains a separate compartment and
flow for the fuel and oxidant, which makes CCS more efficient [305].
PThus, CCS deployment has the potential to worsen or improve
regional or local AQ while providing substantial GHG mitigation,
making it somewhat unique among considered strategies. The com-
plex impacts of various CCS technologies on pollutant emissions
make it challenging to assess definitively, as AQ impacts will be spe-
cific to technology type in regards to plant design and capture strat-
egy, and to the utilized fuel(s). A study of the Dutch power sector
reported that the introduction of CCS (post- and pre-combustion)
increased emission of NOx, PM, and NH3, but significantly reduced
SO2 [291]. Similar results were demonstrated for deployment of
three major capture systems (post- and pre-combustion and oxyfuel
to specific
combustion) with impacts varying with respect

Ptechnology deployed (e.g., SO2 reduced 27 to 41%, impacts on NOx
varying from ¡20 to +15%, and PM ranging from ¡59 to +26%) [304].
Increased emissions could be particularly important with regards to
the formation of ozone and PM2.5 as the largest reported increases
are for NOx, a precursor emission for both species. Contrastingly, SO2
emissions are expected to be significantly reduced as a result of CCS
utilization and could provide benefits to PM2.5 levels due to reduced
sulfate PM formation and others including acid rain. The technol-
ogy-driven nature of
impacts gives value towards pursuing
advanced generation technologies such as IGCC, IGFC, or fuel cells if
CCS is deployed at a large-scale. It should also be considered that
related pathways for carbon management including CO2 re-utiliza-
tion to embed CO2 in a commercial products (e.g., synthetic fuels
and chemicals, concrete curing) are advancing and may play a role
in future GHG mitigation efforts [306,307]. Thus, tradeoffs and syn-
ergies exist with regards to GHG and AQ impacts across different
CCS applications, both with regards to technologies and fuels.

4.4. Regional AQ and GHG implications of low-carbon generation
options

PIt is important then, to measure the performance of current natu-
ral gas conversion technologies and infrastructure against current
alternatives and to measure future natural gas and infrastructure
use against future alternatives. The majority of renewable pathways
on a life cycle basis produce very low-carbon power relative to natu-
ral gas and provide additional environmental benefits e.g., emission
reductions for most renewable technologies exceed 80% even com-
pared to a state-of-the-art NGCC without CCS (Table 16). Thus, it is
also important to establish and support (e.g., policy, incentives) a
vision for the evolution of the natural gas system to one that ulti-
mately supports renewable electricity and a 100% renewable gas
delivery system. Undeniably, the optimal sustainability goal for
energy systems is to source all primary energy from renewable
resources and convert such energy with zero GHG, and zero pollut-
ant emissions, environmental disruption, water demand, or waste.
While reduced significantly from coal generation, even the best cur-
rent natural gas generation options produce emissions of CO2 and
pollutants at levels that contribute to climate and regional AQ con-
cerns [34]. The carbon footprint of both conventional and advanced

Pfossil natural gas generation is greater than many other low-carbon
strategies including nuclear power and most renewable resources.
Therefore, long-term sustainability requires that the natural gas sys-
tem evolve to support and complement other zero GHG and zero AQ
emissions technologies.

PIn addition, the majority of the so-called “advanced” natural gas
technologies presented herein (e.g., fuel cell systems) have no or
very low point-of-use pollutant emissions and can potentially offer
regional AQ benefits as they become part of the natural gas system
evolution. Fig. 7 shows the relative potential for GHG mitigation and
regional AQ improvement for current and advanced natural gas gen-
eration methods operating on fossil natural gas, and the other low-
carbon generation strategies considered here. Intermittent renew-
able resources including wind and solar have high potential for GHG
and AQ co-benefits, particularly if advanced zero- and near-zero
complementary generation strategies are used. Similarly, nuclear
power generation, while it has the challenges discussed previously,
represents an option for GHG mitigation and AQ improvement that
is greater than advanced natural gas generation. Biopower strategies
offer the potential for the highest GHG benefits (i.e., potentially net-
zero or net-negative emissions) and very high AQ benefits due to the
ability to offset emissions from traditional management practices
and energy conversion methods. However, this requires careful
design of conversion pathways as the potential for direct emissions
and other impacts from biogas and biomass resource pathways can
result in detrimental AQ impacts. The deployment of CCS technolo-
gies may reduce GHG emissions from coal plants relative to natural
gas generation without CCS, but the commercial success of CCS
would likely facilitate the use with NGCC as well. The AQ impacts of
CCS are not necessarily beneficial with conventional technologies (e.
g., PC and NGCC plants) due to the potential for AQ emissions
increases associated with efficiency losses. The opportunity for natu-
ral gas generation to provide AQ benefits together with GHG reduc-
tions when using CCS is most significant for advanced generation
methods. For example, fuel cell systems can incorporate CCS with
much lower efficiency penalty compared to traditional generation
due to separated fuel and oxidant compartments. In addition, fuel
cells, advanced NGCC, and CCHP strategies are associated with
higher potential for AQ benefits than CCS of traditional technologies
and some biopower pathways. However, the challenge of attaining
deep GHG reductions while still using fossil gas supply limits the
mitigation potential of such devices. It is therefore reasonable to
select renewable resources or even nuclear power generation as a

advanced natural gas generation utilizing fossil natural gas resources and additional
low-carbon generation methods.

Ppreferred GHG mitigation and AQ improvement strategy when
directly comparing emissions and other environmental impacts. The
role of the natural gas system then is to evolve to increasingly sup-
port the limitations of these zero emissions technologies.

PAdditionally, understanding implications for regional AQ is not as
straight forward due to the complexity associated with the forma-
tion and fate of atmospheric pollution. The dynamics of formation
are complex and predicting how technologically-driven pollutant
emissions translate to changes in ground-level concentrations is
challenging. Strategies to reduce GHG emissions will also affect
regional sources of pollutants and vice versa. Such shifts could be in
quantity (i.e., net reduction or increase) and/or chemical composi-
tion (i.e., different pollutant species) and/or dynamics (i.e., time
series of release). Ambient concentrations are determined by multi-
ple factors, including the quantity, location, and timing of direct
emissions from sources, and various atmospheric processes includ-
ing transport, dilution, deposition, and chemical reaction. Emission
impacts in the electricity sector directly depend upon the displaced
generation source which is complicated by variations in technolo-
gies, fuels, and demands that comprise regional power grids. Fur-
thermore, spatial and temporal shifts in emission patterns can
influence the formation and fate of secondary pollutants that carry
human health consequences, including ozone and PM2.5, with multi-
faceted atmospheric chemistry that ultimately determines the for-
mative species level impacts. Additionally, emissions themselves are
insufficient to create AQ problems, which require certain features of
regional geography and meteorology coupled with population expo-
sure. As a result, AQ conditions are dependent upon natural factors,
including topography, meteorology, biogenic emissions and climate;
in addition to the local emissions signature associated with anthro-
pogenic sources. Thus, predicting how technologically-driven pollut-
ant emissions impacts translates to changes in atmospheric
concentrations requires more than a simple emissions quantification
and comparison, even at the life cycle level, as this fails to capture
these important sources of impact.

PUsing ozone as an example, NOx emitted as nitric oxide (NO) rap-
idly reacts in the atmosphere to produce nitrogen dioxide (NO2),
which further reacts with VOC in the presence of sunlight via a series
of photochemical reactions involving hydroxyl-, peroxy-, and alkoxy
radicals to form oxidants including ozone and peroxyacetyl nitrate
(PAN) [316]. Additionally, regions can be either NOx- or VOC-limited
(generally VOC-limited areas encompass urban centers with high
anthropogenic emissions and NOx-limited areas include rural loca-
tions) which directly impacts resulting variations in ground-level
ozone from the initial
increases in emissions
reductions or
[317,318]. Similarly multifaceted relationships exist between direct
emissions and atmospheric PM concentrations [319,320]. Thus, pre-
dicting how implementation of a generation strategy will impact
ozone or PM based off approximations of emission reductions or
increases is quite limited. In fact, a thorough assessment of such
impacts requires characterization of technological information to
develop detailed spatially and temporally resolved pollutant emis-
sion fields to serve as input for atmospheric models that can account
for chemical and physical atmospheric processes, e.g., mixing, trans-
port, and photochemistry [321].

PWhile many studies have been conducted for the power sector
utilizing atmospheric modeling, e.g.,
for DG implementation
[123,322,323], coal power plants [34,69,70] and others [102,324],
additional assessments are needed to further understand AQ impacts
that result from changes in emissions. Therefore, a significant
research need exists for studies involving realistic scenarios of vari-
ous future power generation mixes across a range of possible socio-
economic and techno-economic drivers. Emissions should be
resolved spatially and temporally, and would be best if attained via
modeling that accounts for the dynamic dispatch of generators and
utility grid network constraints within a specified network, as well

three dimensional AQ models should be utilized to quantify and

(including secondary pollutant formation and transport phenomena)
that result from the technological changes considered.

5. Support of renewable resources to achieve emission
reductions

PNatural gas is unique amongst fossil fuels with regards to the
benefits of complementing renewable resource integration. These
benefits include (1) the dynamic ramping ability of modern natural
gas power generation methods, (2) low criteria pollutant and GHG
emissions relative to other fossil fuel generation methods, particu-
larly during dynamic operation, (3) technical ease with which
renewable fuel alternatives such as biogases can be substituted, and
(4) potential for transition to 100% renewable fuel (e.g., biogas,
renewable hydrogen) injection, storage, and delivery in the future.

5.1. Low- and zero-emission complementary generation

PIncreasing the capacity of renewable resources will require over-
coming challenges associated with electricity system incorporation.
The existing structure of the U.S. and regional electrical grids and
the nature of renewable resources (e.g., many with characteristic
intermittencies, uncontrollability, etc.) cause difficulties for manag-
ing load balancing and other key operational parameters that can
result in undesirable outcomes, e.g., enhanced power curtailment,
increased costs, and large required installed capacities [325]. This is
particularly true regarding the integration of high levels of wind and
solar generation in terms of systems-level operation [153,325].
Wind and solar resources are characteristically intermittent at mul-
tiple time scales (e.g., hourly, daily, seasonally) and complementary
strategies are needed to ensure satisfactory systems-level operation
(cid:1) most notably balancing generation with demand. Grid operation
must accommodate all load demand conditions irrespective of the
availability of renewable power and, due to the rapidity at which
intermittent resources come online and/or dropout, additional
reserve capacity and ramping capabilities must be constantly avail-
able [326]. As a result, high penetration of renewable power dictates
rapid responses by controllable generators (mostly fossil fueled
today) and energy storage or other complementary technologies.
Regardless of the amount of each complementary technology
deployed it is likely that high penetration of wind and solar power
will lead to greater dynamic operation of existing fossil generators.

PIn California, natural gas power plants are most often used to
provide the complementary generation needed to balance renew-
ables and load including those with load-following or peaking capa-
bilities5 [38]. In other regions of the U.S. such capabilities may be
required from generators with higher emission rates than natural
gas plants, including coal power plants. Natural gas load following
and peaker plants are often simple cycle steam or combustion gas
turbines with lower efficiencies and higher emissions than baseload
plants [66]. Natural gas baseload generation is often provided by
higher efficiency and lower emitting NGCC. Consequences of wind
and solar integration can include increased load following and peak-
ing generation accompanied by a decrease in generation from base-
load generators visible in the modeled generator-level impacts from
increasing integration of wind and solar resources in the California
grid presented in Fig. 8. Additionally, increasing levels of curtailed
generation are observed that could have economic and energy con-
sequences.

PThe system-wide impacts related to intermittencies of renewable
integration can have unwanted and unforeseen GHG and pollutant
emission impacts, in addition to the positive benefits of offsetting
direct emissions from fossil generators [328]. Emission rates of GHG
and pollutants per unit energy of electricity from natural gas power
plants increase during dynamic operation events including cycling,
ramping and start/stop conditions [329,330]. Ramping has deleteri-
ous impacts on plant efficiency (and thus emissions) by two mecha-
nisms (cid:1) (1) heat rates are higher for ramping resources at full load
relative to units designed to be operated at fixed levels of output and
(2) the operation of gas plants at partial load results in a higher heat
rate relative to full load operation [331]. All of the described stages
of dynamic operation (i.e., start/stop, cycling, ramping) result in pol-
lutant and GHG emissions that otherwise would not have been gen-
erated. The large-scale electrification of energy systems could
potentially exacerbate the issues previously mentioned by increas-
ing the size and altering the shape of the load. Therefore, it is not
accurate to assume that increasing the levels of intermittent renew-
ables will have no detrimental AQ impacts as utility grid network
integration of
these resources requires balancing power that
includes emissions from fossil generators that could potentially
reduce expected emissions benefits or even yield localized increases
in emissions from certain power plants [328,332(cid:1)335].

5 Such plants are typically associated with marginal generation or the last plants to
come online in the loading order. Marginal generation is typically impacted by renew-
able resource integration.

PFuture

complementary generation can be provided by
advanced technologies and strategies in place of current fossil
complementary generation to improve efficiencies and avoid
undesirable emission impacts. Fig. 9 displays the emissions of NOx
per unit energy for traditional and advanced heat engines and fuel
cells operating on natural gas that represent potential technolo-
gies for load balancing intermittent renewables in place of natural
gas load following and peaking units in California. Emissions of
NOx from NGCC are much lower than both (cid:1) particularly for new
state-of-the-art NGCC relative to existing load following and peak-
ing generation. Load following and peaking plants may also
require up to several hours to start or stop and therefore often
must be run (i.e., cycled) to be ready for any renewable generation
drop off. Contrastingly, if available renewable generation increases
then the available output from gas generators may be unutilized
even though they continue to operate. Therefore, increasing the
amount of total generation from load following and peaking plants
at the expense of baseload plants (as shown in Fig. 8) can result in
additional GHG and pollutant emissions [336]. In contrast, fuel
cell generation results in negligible emissions relative to other
devices including combustion turbines, microturbines, reciprocat-
ing engines and NGCC. Technologies utilizing combustion (i.e.,
reciprocating engines, combustion turbines, microturbines) can
also operate with lower emissions than load-following and peak-
ing generation but may require pollutant control technologies to
achieve minimum emission limits. For example, microturbines
must be integrated with CCHP to achieve reductions in GHG, and
must be integrated with SCR technology to achieve low criteria
pollutant emissions [35,125,126].

PFuel cells can deliver peaking or intermediate load-following
service, which can prevent the need for new transmission and dis-
tribution infrastructure and provide peaking capacity in emissions
and/or electricity infrastructure constrained areas. Fuel cells have
been evaluated for providing grid support in energy systems with
very high levels of intermittent resources [338] including a 100%
renewable energy system in support of climate mitigation [339].
Future fuel cell or fuel cell hybrid systems can provide load follow-
ing capabilities in tandem with low emissions with proper system
and control configurations [340]. Clusters of 10(cid:1)100 MW scale fuel
cells installed at distribution substations have been proposed as a
method of supporting high penetrations of intermittent renewables
through the provision of baseload and load following services with
very low NOx and CO2 [38]. Fuel cells can also be integrated in the
residential sector to support and complement solar PV deployment

P[341]. Power conditioning inverters in fuel cell systems that are
needed to transform DC electricity into AC can be used for system
power factor correction and voltage support. The load-following
capabilities of fuel cells are particularly important in regions with
projected increases in intermittent wind and solar power genera-
tion that will necessitate increasing amounts of clean, efficient,
load-following power generation. This would maximize the GHG
reductions of renewable resources while limiting any negative
effects on regional AQ that the renewable intermittencies would
otherwise introduce.

PTherefore, emissions must be considered at the systems-level
rather than simply comparing life cycle or direct emissions at the
point-of-generation. For example, while it is certain that renewables
must play a central role in a sustainable energy system, large-scale
integration in regional energy systems is not a simple matter. This is
particularly true for wind and solar power, which are likely to com-
prise the largest portion of future renewable capacity in most
regions around the world with potential unforeseen electrical grid
impacts including sites of emissions increases leading to AQ worsen-
ing. For example, emissions of NOx and VOC from conventional load
following and peaking generation could contribute to increases in
ground-level ozone concentrations in regions adjacent to power
plants. Similarly, direct and secondary emission impacts could drive
increases in ground level concentrations of PM. Thus,
in the
absence of enhanced flexibility and intelligence of the grid and
the presence of low or zero-emitting and controllable comple-
mentary strategies, high levels of renewable integration could
yield some localized worsening in regional AQ. This must be con-
sidered in the context that overall AQ impacts of high renewable
power use will be largely beneficial as a result of net emission
reductions compared to fossil generation. Therefore, the worsen-
ing described herein is directly referencing localized areas
around impacted fossil generators that would be forced to oper-
ate in a highly dynamic fashion to complement renewable inter-
mittencies. This scenario could have particular importance in
many urban areas due to high population exposure and for
regions currently experiencing challenges meeting ambient air
quality standards. Similarly, the GHG impacts of renewables will
almost certainly result in net reductions in emissions (cid:1) but the
total reduction could be increased and AQ benefits preserved if
emissions from complementary generation could be avoided or
minimized.

P5.1.1. Other low- and zero-emission complementary generation

PIn terms of providing complementary generation, energy stor-
age technologies are a key strategy in support of renewable inte-
gration. Energy storage, which also represents a complementary
option for balancing intermittent resources, also can potentially
reduce GHG emissions from natural gas by 21(cid:1)98% with life
cycle emissions ranging from 6(cid:1)292 gCO2/kWh [312]. A wide
range of technologies are available or under consideration for
the support of renewable energy, with a comprehensive over-
view provided in [342]. It is well understood that energy storage
has the potential to support renewable energy and provide envi-
ronmental benefits [343]. Energy storage devices are more
responsive than conventional generators and costs are becoming
more competitive with other sources of generation [344]. Fur-
ther, they can provide emission benefits as many have very low
to no emissions during operation, e.g., batteries, flywheels.
Energy storage can then have GHG and AQ benefits by reducing
emissions associated with load balancing and spinning reserve
via replacement of
fuel backup generators
[345,346]. Energy storage can also reduce emissions by time-
shifting loads away from peak demand, reducing generation
from peaking and load following plants in place of base-load
generation [347]. The following pathways are recommended for

Pproviding dispatchable power to support renewables in [348],
and would likely provide very low to zero emission complemen-
tary generation with AQ and GHG benefits.

P(cid:3) Expand the use of high-capacity batteries including the develop-
ment and commercialization of advanced technologies such as
solid state and flow batteries, supercapacitors and super con-
ducting magnetic energy storage.

P(cid:3) Develop high-capacity compressed air storage resources includ-
ing underground caverns where geologically and technically fea-
sible.

P(cid:3) Expand the use of thermal energy storage mechanisms including
molten salts, solids, and other high heat capacity media, or via
phase change.

P(cid:3) Construct high-capacity pumped-hydro storage facilities where

feasible.

P(cid:3) Develop large-scale flywheels for direct storage and recovery of

kinetic energy.

PHowever, large-scale deployment of energy storage faces bar-
riers including, among others, economics, regulatory and utility
structures, and siting of facilities [349(cid:1)351]. These barriers com-
plicate an understanding of when and how the very large capaci-
ties needed to match increasing levels of renewables will become
available. Therefore, while providing complementary generation
from advanced strategies, including energy storage, represents an
important and valuable long-term goal, natural gas generation is
currently the most feasible method of balancing fluctuating renew-
able power with load and may continue to be so in the near- to
mid-term.

PFurther, energy storage may not always be the environmentally
preferred option for providing reserves if not managed properly,
even if it is assumed to have no operational emissions [352]. For
example, if energy storage enables system operators to use lower
cost generation with higher emissions that would otherwise not be
possible due to reserve requirements [353]. Analyzation of adding
energy storage to a power system concluded emission impacts
were highly case-dependent [354]. In systems with high renewable
penetration levels and significant curtailment energy storage did
provide emission reductions. However, in other systems emission
impacts were reported to be positive, neutral, or negative. It should
be noted that the most appropriate comparison for the discussion
here is the high renewable integration scenario and the use of oth-
erwise curtailed power. In such a case energy storage is likely to
provide emission reduction benefits by making available renewable
electricity to meet demand otherwise satisfied by dispatchable
generation.

PAdditional options for low environmental impact complementary
generation includes Smart Grid technologies, demand response,
clean dispatchable power generation, and other strategies including
transportation sector integration through vehicle-to-grid services.
Smart Grid technologies offer benefits relative to the current grid;
including improving power quality and reliability, reducing costs,
improving efficiency and conservation,
increased
renewable resources, and advanced technology penetrations, and
enabling enhanced supply- and demand-side energy management
[355]. Implementation of Smart Grid technologies can have impor-
tant direct GHG and pollutant emissions benefits by improving sys-
levels of necessitated
tems-level
generation [356(cid:1)358]. Vehicle-to-grid strategies also can provide
emission benefits, essentially functioning as a form of battery energy
storage [359]. As with other forms of energy storage, these strategies
will require further advancement, both techno-economically and in
social acceptance, but represent an optimal method of providing
complementary generation in place of fossil fuels.

5.2. Low carbon renewable fuel storage and transmission

PAn additional avenue of support for renewable resources in pur-
suit of GHG and AQ reductions includes the use of existing natural
gas infrastructure to transport, store, and distribute renewable gas-
eous fuels with two prominent examples including biogas and
hydrogen sourced from renewable resources. Within the U.S. a
robust and established infrastructure network exists to support the
natural gas industry, including greater than 300,000 miles of trans-
mission pipelines, gathering systems, storage sites, processing
plants, and distribution pipelines [25]. Gaseous fuels can be
upgraded and injected into existing natural gas infrastructure to pro-
vide a source of flexible fuel which can be utilized in various end-use
applications [216,217]. The use of renewable gaseous fuels as energy
resources is desirable due to potentially net-zero GHG intensities,
reduced pollutant emissions and additional energy and environmen-
tal benefits [360]. In addition to directly providing fuels for energy
services, use of low-carbon pipeline fuels can provide additional
emission reductions, e.g., avoidance of emissions associated with the
construction or expansion of transmission infrastructure for hydro-
gen or electricity. The use of renewable gaseous fuels can further
support and enhance other forms of renewable energy including
renewable power generation from intermittent resources. Relative
to renewable resources and electrification alone, the addition of
low-carbon gaseous fuels distributed via existing natural gas pipe-
lines is complementary in meeting future GHG mitigation goals by
[361]:

P(cid:3) Assisting in reducing emissions from sources that experience
greater challenges to electrifying (e.g., industrial process heat-
ing, heavy duty vehicles, aircraft).

P(cid:3) Supporting intermittent renewable power integration by pro-
viding a form of energy storage amenable to large-scale energy
magnitude and long-duration storage to balance load and
demand.

P(cid:3) Offsetting the need for new infrastructure (e.g., electric trans-
mission wires) construction by enabling continued use of exiting
gas pipelines.

P(cid:3) Enabling widespread use of the renewable low-emissions fuel in
all sectors of the economy due to the pervasiveness of the natu-
ral gas grid.

P(cid:3) Helping reduce technological risk and improve flexibility for

decision makers.

PTherefore, the natural gas system inherently possesses features
that are, and will be, valuable to ultimate sustainability, perhaps
offering the only technically feasible option (and certainly one of the
most cost effective options) for achieving massive and long-term
storage of renewable electricity, and achieving 100% emissions-free
energy conversion in all sectors of the economy and especially the
challenging sectors (e.g., heavy duty transport and industry).

P5.2.1. Renewable fuel injection in the grid

PThe potential for increased biogas resources is significant e.g.,
biogas generation could potentially be expanded to provide 3 to 5%
of the total domestic natural gas market [362]. Following clean-up
for compounds including siloxanes and hydrogen sulfide, biogas is
notably similar to fossil natural gas in chemical composition (i.e., a
renewable biological source of methane) enabling direct inter-
changeability in the natural gas system for sources of demand.
Upgraded biogas can readily be injected into the existing natural gas
system, facilitating the storage, transport, and distribution of a
renewable gaseous fuel. This further allows for biogas to be trans-
ported to numerous possible end-uses with potential for higher
value than that which is available only local to the biogas resource
sites [363]. For example, pipeline biogas could supply a portion of

Pthe resources utilized by a centralized NGCC with benefits of scale
including reduced emissions [260] and potentially lower cost rela-
tive to generation on-site at resource locations, although economics
and emission impacts of biogas utilization strategies are complex
and depend on many factors [360,362,364]. However, the expanded
use of biogas in the U.S. would benefit from nuanced policies and
programs supporting site-specific evaluations and actions, as
opposed to generic approaches [360].

PBiogas is generally 55(cid:1)65% methane with the remainder com-
posed of CO2, fractions of water vapor, traces of hydrogen sulfide
and hydrogen, and other contaminants including siloxanes. An
important step in facilitating long distance transport from an eco-
nomic and energy sensibility standpoint is increasing the energy
content [365]. Additionally, attaining pipeline quality gas for injec-
tion represents a techno-economic hurdle for biogas at present. Bio-
gas composition and quality differ across sources of origin (e.g.,
landfills, manure digesters, gasifiers, etc.) with implications for vari-
ous end-uses [366]. This requires site- and case-specific selection of
upgrading technologies dependent on factors including product
purity and impurities, methane recovery and loss, upgrading effi-
ciency, and investment and operating costs [367]. Regulatory and
technical standards associated with the acceptance of biogas into
pipelines differ by state and country. For example, California gas
contaminant standards for investor-owned utility gas are compara-
ble to other States and have been found to be reasonably achievable
using conventional gas clean-up technologies [368]. Contrastingly,
minimum energy content standards are higher than other locations,
and the majority of conventional and emerging biogas upgrading
technologies may not provide acceptable gas [368]. Additionally bio-
gas cleaning and upgrading costs can be high, resulting in the eco-
nomic unfeasibility of pipeline injection for low quantity biogas
producers operating small anaerobic digestion systems. To address
this issue, the following recommendations were put forth in a report
to the California Energy Commission as an example of potential
research and regulatory steps in support of biogas utilization and
gas grid injection [368]:

P(cid:3) Reduce the energy content requirements for pipeline biome-

thane from 990 to 960(cid:1)980 Btu/scf on a HHV basis.

P(cid:3) Collect data on concentrations of contaminants of concern in
current California natural gas supply including instate and
imported sources.

P(cid:3) Address costs and provide financial support and incentives for
biogas upgrading and pipeline interconnection and for small-
scale DG systems.

P(cid:3) Develop a streamlined application process (e.g., standardized
forms, agreements) to minimize time and resources spent by all
parties.

PHydrogen can be produced with very low emissions from a
diverse selection of renewable pathways including by electrolysis
from electricity generated by wind and solar technologies, the proc-
essing of biogas resources, and via direct solar water splitting in a
process called artificial photosynthesis [369]. Although not renew-
able, hydrogen could also be produced from additional low-carbon
pathways including cogeneration of electricity and hydrogen via
high-temperature nuclear reactors and fossil pathways with the
inclusion of CCS, e.g., coal gasification and SMR of natural gas [370].
Even the most common current method for producing hydrogen,
SMR of natural gas, provides a relatively low GHG and AQ emissions
pathway to produce a fuel that has no GHG and no AQ emissions in
its end use in a fuel cell, for example [371]. While current hydrogen
production methods generally rely upon fossil pathways, progres-
sive shifts towards renewable and other low-carbon strategies can
allow for the production of hydrogen in increasingly sustainable
methods.

PA notable hydrogen strategy for both the production of very low-
carbon fuels and the support of intermittent renewable integration
is the electrolysis of water via otherwise curtailed renewable elec-
tricity (most often wind and solar power), a concept often referred
to as power-to-gas (P2G) [372]. Generally, the P2G strategy is a
means of linking the electrical grid and the natural gas grid by con-
verting electricity (typically surplus renewable electricity) into a
grid compatible gaseous fuel [373]. An overview of P2G system inte-
gration with renewable electricity is shown in Fig. 10. Excess avail-
able wind and solar power can be fed to battery energy storage for
short-term storage, or sent to an electrolyzer to produce renewable
hydrogen, which better enables long-term and massive energy stor-
age. Produced hydrogen can then be stored in dedicated facilities
and used on-site when needed in stationary and mobile applications
achieving emission reductions. For example, hydrogen can be used
to power fuel cell electric vehicles with negligible pollutant emis-
sions in place of petroleum-fueled vehicles or utilized in stationary
fuel cells to efficiently generate on-site power and heat. Hydrogen

Pmay also be injected into the natural gas system directly, or reacted
with an external carbon source in a methanation reaction to produce
renewable methane. Similarly to hydrogen, this renewably produced
methane can be injected into existing natural gas storage and distri-
bution grids, used on-site as a stationary generation or vehicle fuel,
or utilized in other established natural gas end-uses.

PAn important ability of P2G is the potential to support the
deployment of electrical systems with very high levels of renewable
electricity (e.g., 85%) by providing a means of long-term energy stor-
age potentially from the sub-megawatt to gigawatt power scale and
comprising up to 10s of terawatt hours of energy [374,375]. Addi-
tionally, electrolyzers utilized in P2G systems can provide grid func-
tions including rapid demand or supply response, spinning reserve,
and frequency and voltage regulation. Typically, the most commonly
considered renewable energy source for P2G systems is wind and
solar power that become difficult to otherwise manage at high use
levels [372]. P2G can facilitate hydrogen production during periods
of excess renewable generation that would otherwise be curtailed,
which assists in addressing the spatial and temporal challenges dis-
cussed for renewable energy [375]. Additional benefits of P2G in
energy storage include siting flexibility, sub-second response times,
and minimal adverse environmental impact in both the production
and end-use of the renewable fuel, especially if the hydrogen is con-
verted ultimately to electricity in a fuel cell for either transportation
or stationary power applications [376].

PThe injection of hydrogen directly (i.e., without methanation)
into the existing natural gas system is being considered as a means
of facilitating the production, storage, and transport of large quanti-
ties of a renewable fuel that can be used as an energy source by a
range of zero-emitting end-use devices [133,377]. Use of the existing
natural gas system also represents a solution to the key barrier of
current lack of hydrogen infrastructure [378]. However, due to the
differences in chemical properties between hydrogen and natural
gas, concerns exist including safety, leakage rate and dispersion, and
materials degradation including embrittlement of pipeline steel
[379]. The amount of hydrogen allowable in the natural gas system
varies by region and typically ranges from 0 to 12% by volume [373].
However,
these concerns are being actively
addressed through various research and development projects
around the world and it is possible that in the future hydrogen may
be injected at increasingly higher concentrations as mixed with nat-
ural gas.

the majority of

PMethanation of hydrogen to produce synthetic methane has
some advantages over simply utilizing hydrogen, namely the ability
to serve as drop-in fuel with regards to current infrastructure and
use in existing natural gas consuming technologies. Essentially, syn-
thetic methane is completely usable in the existing, technically
mature natural gas infrastructure, e.g., can be feasibly injected into
existing natural gas grids without many of the challenges associated
with hydrogen [380]. This results in economic benefits as no new
investments are required for transport, storage, and utilization, but
also is beneficial in avoiding issues of obtaining permission from
authorities and general public acceptance [381]. Different methods
for methanation include both biological and catalytic rectors with
implications for achievable gas quality, reactor volume, and the com-
plexity of process technology required [373].

PMajor technical and economic barriers exist for P2G that must be
overcome, however. For example, though water electrolysis has
existed commercially for several decades only approximately 4% of
global hydrogen supply is derived from such pathways [382]. Con-
sidering electrolysis, improvements in efficiency during transient
operation and reductions in capital cost are needed [373]. Currently,
alkaline electrolysis is the lowest cost and most reliable technology,
but has limited efficiency improvement and cost reduction potential.
PEM electrolysis can offer improved transient performance and
have a simple modular design, but cost reduction and technical

Pimprovement including membrane lifetime of PEM electrolyzers is
needed. Similarly, solid oxide electrolysis can offer the benefits of
very high efficiencies but will require further technical development
prior to commercialization including increased lifetime [383]. If
hydrogen storage is utilized this can also contribute to high costs
[384]. Methanation as a viable commercial step would benefit from
techno-economic advancement including an improved understand-
ing of dynamic reactor operation, advancement in cool fixed-bed
reactors, and others [373,385].

PAn additional issue associated with injection of both biogas and
hydrogen into the existing natural gas supply is the potential impact
on end-use combustion performance [385]. Current end-use devices
(e.g., turbines, engines, industrial burners, residential and commer-
cial appliances) are optimized for use on pure natural gas. Altering
the composition of the supplied fuel could result in alterations to
key parameters including heating value, Wobbe-index, knock phe-
nomena, flame stability, blow off limits, and flashback [385]. Given
the scope of this review, perhaps the most important concern is
associated with potential changes in emissions. Impacts on criteria
pollutants will vary for systems depending on many factors includ-
ing gas composition, end-use device geometry, operational parame-
ters, presence of clean-up technologies, etc. One concern is increases
in NOx from the addition of hydrogen, although this could also
reduce hydrocarbon and CO2 emissions [386]. However, if device
operation is controlled properly NOx emissions could be maintained
at equivalent levels [387,388] or even reduced due to leaner com-
bustion [389]. Impacts may also be multi-faceted with regards to dif-
ferent pollutants. For example, adding hydrogen to natural gas had a
range of impacts on NO2, NO, and N2O emissions from an industrial
boiler, including inverse relationships between species for some
operating conditions [390]. These results highlight the complicated
nature and lack of current understanding of emission impacts from
end-use devices due to the blending of renewable fuels. Further
studies are needed for stationary power generation technologies
under a range of operating conditions and different renewable fuel
blends. Studies should also be undertaken elucidating the AQ
impacts from economy-wide scenarios of renewable gas blending in
future years using atmospheric modeling. Results from such assess-
ments can provide insights into end-use device management to min-
imize AQ degradation, potentially through policy mechanisms and
other programs.

6. Discussion, analysis, and recommendations

PWithin this review we have demonstrated that natural gas gener-
ation and the natural gas system could play several important roles
in supporting sustainable energy strategies over time that can
achieve the GHG reductions and AQ improvements sought by soci-
ety, most notably by maximizing the emission benefits of renewable
resources. Natural gas generation can support transitions to renew-
able resources by (1) use in advanced conversion devices to provide
complementary grid services efficiently and with very low emissions
to maximize the benefits of intermittent renewable resources, and
(2) natural gas generation and the existing natural gas system can
support the use of renewable gaseous fuels with high energy and
environmental benefits. This is because advanced conversion devices
(including fuel cells [391]) can operate on natural gas and renewable
gaseous fuels, including blends, with very low direct pollutant emis-
sions and the existing natural gas system can support the produc-
tion, storage, and distribution of renewable gaseous fuels. The ability
of hydrogen to be produced via a range of pathways, including from
multiple renewable feedstocks, and to be used by high efficiency
and zero-emitting fuel cell devices in a diverse a range of applica-
tions across all economic sectors (e.g., transportation, power genera-
tion, industry, the built environment) raises the possibility of energy
systems with essentially produce negligible emissions of both GHG

Pand pollutants [392]. Advanced conversion technologies can thus
provide renewable energy pathways that achieve very high GHG and
AQ co-benefits [393]. Within this section, we propose a pathway for-
ward for natural gas power generation to achieve AQ and GHG bene-
fits within the broader context of sustainable energy systems and
we describe required research objectives.

6.1. Towards a sustainable domestic gas system

PAppropriate design, management and evolution of the natural
gas system could produce a valuable resource for achieving a sus-
tainable and 100% renewable energy conversion system including
maximizing the GHG and AQ benefits of renewable power and
fuels. The near- to mid-term use of natural gas in environmentally
beneficial methods coupled with a managed evolution to renew-
able gaseous fuels could facilitate economically and technically fea-
sible pathways to the long-term goal of a truly sustainable energy
future characterized by fully renewable energy systems. The judi-
cious use of natural gas to complement renewable intermittency,
the increasing injection of renewable gaseous fuels into the current
supply, and the evolution of infrastructure to reduce leakage and
enable renewable fuel use (including hydrogen) throughout com-
prise a likely means of reducing the carbon intensity of gaseous
fuels and a potential method of complete conversion of the natural
gas system in the long-term. In Fig. 11, a potential evolution of gas
resources, gas conversion strategies, and intermittent renewable
complementary generation strategies are proposed to accomplish
these aims.

PIt should be noted that electrification of end-uses in tandem with
provision of renewable electricity should be pursued with priority
due to the efficiency benefits relative to hydrogen/fuel cell strate-
gies. Indeed, electrification in tandem with renewable power gener-
ation and other very low-carbon forms of energy is known to be
an essential strategy in achieving deep carbon reductions and
AQ improvements targeted for future sustainability [11,17(cid:1)19,394].
However, a renewable gaseous fuel system could support large-scale

Pelectrification in many ways, including providing a means of energy
for end-uses that are difficult to electrify, e.g., aircraft, ocean going
industrial applications. At the same time, the evolving
vessels,
natural gas infrastructure can provide services for large-scale and
long-term storage, energy transmission amongst regions, and energy
distribution to almost all end-uses throughout society. These
services are valuable and cannot be simply replaced if the system is
abandoned.

PNonetheless, a transition of the natural gas system of the type
envisioned here is no simple matter and requires societal and tech-
nological advancements, innovation, and evolution. A significant set
of research and development topics will have to be successfully
addressed, and technologies and solutions must be developed to
enable the transition as described in Fig. 11. Representative areas of
research that are needed are presented in Table 17. The research
areas are informed by the current review paper and are not compre-
hensive nor exhaustive, but rather illustrative of the broad set of
needs.

PIn the near-term, natural gas supply will continue to predomi-
nate from fossil fuel pathways. Blends with fossil natural gas could
feasibly reach 10(cid:1)12% using existing infrastructure without modifi-
cation, but will be technically limited as the initial supplies will
largely arise from existing biogas resources (e.g., maximum potential
for biogas has been estimated at 3 to 5% of national gas supply
[362]). In the mid-term, the blending of renewable fuels up to or
exceeding half of total supply should be pursued. This will require
an amount of renewable gas production likely to represent a signifi-
cant portion of total biogas resources and necessitate large-scale
production of other renewable pathways including P2G and gasifica-
tion of solid biomass. Therefore, the expansion of bulk gaseous
renewable fuel production should receive a policy focus designed to
reduce costs, improve technical feasibility, and quantify and achieve
energy and environmental benefits in complete system applications.
However, total demand for utility gas may be reduced through
wide-spread electrification of end-use sectors thereby reducing the
amount of renewable gas required for production. Research at this

Fig. 11. Proposed steps towards transitioning from a fossil to completely renewable gaseous fuel system that minimizes GHG emissions and AQ impacts.

Pstage should focus on the economics and technical feasibility of
advanced renewable gas production methods including artificial
photosynthesis, nuclear generation methods, high temperature
electrolysis, and others. The ultimate goal long-term will be 100%
renewable gas that is produced, stored, transmitted, and distributed
in the utility gas network. To accomplish this, bulk production of
hydrogen will be required with the majority likely originating from
P2G using the massive amount of peak renewable power that must
be generated to meet all of societies energy demands. This may rep-
resent an important synergy with the electricity sector, as a goal for
100% renewable electricity will entail significant amounts of inter-
mittent wind and solar that would otherwise be curtailed. Additional
fuel production should be accomplished primarily through renew-
able pathways including artificial photosynthesis, solar water-
splitting, etc.

PConversion methods should seek transitions away from devices
utilizing combustion to electrochemical conversion such as that of
fuel cells, fuel cell hybrid systems, and batteries. Commercially
available stationary fuel cell systems and fuel cell hybrid systems
should be prioritized over NGCC and other combustion technolo-
gies. However, it is likely that NGCC and other clean natural gas
power plants will continue to make up some portion of generation
in at least the near- to mid-term. Major efforts should continue to
identify and limit leakage from the natural gas system, as well as
to identify potential impacts of renewable fuel blending on leak-
age rates. The region of deployment must be considered in tech-
nology choice. Regions with current or planned coal generation
will benefit from the use of even conventional NGCC, while
regions already utilizing significant amounts of natural gas gener-
ation, e.g., California, should seek transitions to advanced devices
including fuel cells. Also, impacts of renewable fuel blends on the
performance and emissions from end-use devices should be pur-
sued. An additional area of research should focus on identifying
and prioritizing the best uses of renewable gas in the near-term

Pdue to limited supply and varying opportunities for electrification
in end-use sectors.

PComplementary generation for renewable balancing should
focus on utilizing advanced NGCC in the near-term, as these are
commercially available, have favorable economics, and reason-
ably low emissions relative to other fossil options. Additionally,
advanced low-emitting peaker plants exist that can significantly
reduce emissions from current peaking generation. In the mid-
to long-term, complementary generation for renewable resources
should be accomplished via advanced energy storage to the max-
imum possible extent, with fuel cells and fuel cell hybrid sys-
tems providing the remainder. Additionally, Smart grid and
related strategies should again be pursued with high priority due
to the synergistic and beneficial
interactions with integrating
higher levels of renewable generation, particularly those with
intermittencies. A research focus is needed for developing
advanced complementary strategies with low- to zero-emissions
including fuel cell systems such as those described in [38], P2G
systems, advanced energy storage that can technically and eco-
nomically provide terawatt-hour-scale storage, and advancement
of other load management services including vehicle-to-grid,
demand response, and others.

PDue to the inherent energy and environmental benefits that
are possible, use of biogas resources for energy (rather than no
collection or flaring) should be targeted with priority [395].
However, as discussed in Section 4.4, AQ emissions from current
conversion methods can represent a major barrier to enhanced
deployment levels. For example, while cost effective, reciprocat-
ing engines have difficulty meeting stringent AQ emissions per-
mitting requirements, which can prevent new projects or even
limit the operation of existing systems [396]. In the near-term
then, gas clean-up and injection into the existing gas grid should
be pursued as a means of
immediately reducing the carbon
intensity of the gas system while avoiding permitting challenges.

PBarriers to the deployment of advanced conversion technologies
including fuel cells and micro-turbines should be addressed in
the to support the commercialization of such systems in the
near- to mid-term, as the use of distributed technologies with
very low emissions to convert biomass and biogas fuels on-site
represents a key opportunity to maximize GHG and AQ benefits
of renewable resources [207].
