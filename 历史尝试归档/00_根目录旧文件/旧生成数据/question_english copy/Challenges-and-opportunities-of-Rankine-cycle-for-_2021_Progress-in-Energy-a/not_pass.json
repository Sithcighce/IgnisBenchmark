    "question_text": "Based on the paper's analysis of thermal mismatching in ICE waste heat recovery systems, explain how cascade Rankine cycles and dual-pressure Rankine cycles achieve higher thermodynamic perfection up to 62.3% compared to basic Rankine cycles. Focus specifically on how these advanced configurations address the fundamental thermal mismatching issues identified in the paper, citing the exact mechanisms and principles described in the provided text.",
    "standard_answer": "The paper identifies that basic Rankine cycles (B-RCs) suffer from three major thermal mismatching zones that limit their thermodynamic perfection. Zone 1 involves high-temperature mismatching due to low cycle temperature and pinching limit at the exhaust gas heat exchanger exit. Zone 2 involves low-temperature mismatching from inadequate use of low-temperature heat sources. Zone 3 involves cold side mismatching caused by high condenser inlet temperature. The paper specifically states that cascade Rankine cycles and dual-pressure Rankine cycles are expected to achieve the highest thermodynamic perfection of 62.3% through advanced cycle configuration design based on 'energy utilization according to quality' principles. This improvement comes from better thermal matching with the composite heat source curve formed by multiple waste heat sources (exhaust gas and engine coolant). The advanced configurations systematically reduce the gaps between the actual cycle and the heat source based ideal thermodynamic cycle (H-iCycle) by optimizing heat absorption at different temperature levels, thereby minimizing the temperature differences in heat transfer processes that cause exergy destruction in basic Rankine cycles. The paper emphasizes that these configurations are designed to address the thermal mismatching zones through improved thermal matching with the composite heat source characteristics.",
