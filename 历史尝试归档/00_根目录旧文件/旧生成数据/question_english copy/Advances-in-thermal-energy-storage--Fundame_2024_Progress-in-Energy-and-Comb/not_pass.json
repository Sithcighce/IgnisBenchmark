    "question_text": "Using the provided paper content, compare the fundamental energy storage mechanisms of sensible heat storage (SHS) with water and latent heat storage (LHS) with paraffin PCM. Calculate the energy storage density for water SHS assuming a 20 K temperature swing and water's specific heat of 4.18 kJ/kg·K. Explain why paraffin-based LHS typically offers higher energy density than water SHS, and discuss the thermal behavior of PCMs during phase change processes, focusing on how they maintain nearly constant temperature during phase transitions. Support your analysis with specific citations from the paper.",
    "standard_answer": "Sensible heat storage (SHS) and latent heat storage (LHS) employ fundamentally different thermal energy storage mechanisms. SHS involves heating a material without phase change, where energy is stored as the material's temperature increases, governed by its specific heat capacity. As cited: 'Sensible heat storage (SHS) involves heating a solid or liquid to store thermal energy, considering specific heat and temperature variations during phase change processes. Water is commonly used in SHS due to its abundance and high specific heat.' This citation contains an apparent contradiction since SHS by definition does not involve phase change processes, but the paper presents this definition. In contrast, LHS utilizes phase change materials (PCMs) that absorb or release substantial energy during phase transitions at nearly constant temperature. The paper states: 'Latent heat storage (LHS) utilizes phase change materials (PCMs) that absorb or release heat to maintain a constant temperature. These PCMs have excellent heat storage properties.' For paraffin specifically: 'Organic PCMs includes paraffin wax, which releases considerable latent heat during crystallization, making it ideal for heat fusion storage.' For water-based SHS with a 20 K temperature swing: Energy stored = mass × specific heat × ΔT = 1 kg × 4.18 kJ/kg·K × 20 K = 83.6 kJ/kg. Paraffin-based LHS achieves higher energy density because it leverages latent heat during phase change, which typically ranges from 128-280 kJ/kg according to the paper's data on organic PCMs. During phase change processes, PCMs exhibit a temperature range where latent heat dominates, maintaining nearly constant temperature as described in the citation about LHS maintaining constant temperature. This fundamental advantage arises because phase change transitions require substantial energy input/output without significant temperature change, providing higher energy storage per unit mass compared to sensible heating alone.",
