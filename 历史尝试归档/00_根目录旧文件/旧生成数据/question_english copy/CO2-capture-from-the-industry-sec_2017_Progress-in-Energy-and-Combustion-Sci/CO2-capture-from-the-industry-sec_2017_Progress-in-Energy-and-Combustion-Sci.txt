It is widely accepted that greenhouse gas emissions, especially CO2, must be significantly reduced to pre-
vent catastrophic global warming. Carbon capture and reliable storage (CCS) is one path towards controlling
emissions, and serves as a key component to climate change mitigation and will serve as a bridge between
the fossil fuel energy of today and the renewable energy of the future. Although fossil-fueled power plants
emit the vast majority of stationary CO2, there are many industries that emit purer streams of CO2, which
result in reduced cost for separation. Moreover, many industries outside of electricity generation do not
have ready alternatives for becoming low-carbon and CCS may be their only option. The thermodynamic
minimum work for separation was calculated for a variety of CO2 emissions streams from various indus-
tries, followed by a Sherwood analysis of capture cost. The Sherwood plot correlates the relationship
between concentrations of a target substance with the cost to separate it from the remaining components.
As the target concentration increases, the cost to separate decreases on a molar basis. Furthermore, the low-
est cost opportunities for deploying first-of-a-kind CCS technology were found to be in the Midwest and
along the Gulf Coast. Many high purity industries, such as ethanol production, ammonia production and
natural gas processing, are located in these regions. The southern Midwest and Gulf Coast are also co-
located with potential geologic sequestration sites and enhanced oil recovery opportunities. As a starting
point, these sites may provide the demonstration and knowledge necessary for reducing carbon capture
technology costs across all industries, and improving the economic viability for CCS and climate change mit-
igation. The various industries considered in this review were examined from a dilution and impact per-
spective to determine the best path forward in terms of prioritizing for carbon capture. A possible
implementation pathway is presented that initially focuses on CO2 capture from ethanol production, fol-
lowed by the cement industry, ammonia, and then natural gas processing and ethylene oxide production.
While natural gas processing and ethylene oxide production produce high purity streams, they only account
for relatively small portions of industrial process CO2. Finally, petroleum refineries account for almost a fifth
of industrial process CO2, but are comprised of numerous low-purity CO2 streams. These qualities make
these three industries less attractive for initial CC implementation, and better suited for consideration
towards the end of the industrial CC pathway.

1. Introduction

PClimate change has been a topic of much debate over the past
several decades.
Increased levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) and
other greenhouse gases (GHG) are responsible for the global
warming that fuels climate change. As the acceptance of climate
change has increased, so too has the related discussion on ways
to adapt to and mitigate its existence. The most recent example
is the 21st Conference of Parties (COP21), held in Paris, France in
December 2015. Since 1992, the Conference of Parties has been
held annually to revisit ideas and plans set by the United Nations
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) [1]. COP21 represented
an unprecedented moment for climate change action, as over
190 countries agreed to curb GHG emissions to limit the global
temperature rise to below 2 °C [2]. Within the U.S., further action
to cut carbon emissions has taken place. In August of 2015, Pres-
ident Obama and the EPA announced the Clean Power Plan,
which places carbon emission limits on existing and future
power plants. Although it is under review by the Supreme Court,
it could be a historic moment for the U.S. as the first ever
national emissions standards [3,4].

PCarbon dioxide makes up the majority of GHG emissions,
accounting for 65% of global and 82% of U.S. emissions [4,5]. The U.S.
alone emits approximately 16% of the global CO2 emissions, second
only to China's 30% [6]. Given the country's contribution to CO2
emissions, the U.S. must lead the charge to reduce these emissions.
Carbon capture and storage provides one possible solution.

PCarbon capture and storage (CCS) is considered a critical part
of many climate change mitigation plans, as it provides a bridge
between our current fossil-fuel based economy and a renewable
energy future [7(cid:1)14]. To achieve CCS on a wide-scale within sta-
tionary sources, a way to reduce implementation costs could be
application at a smaller scale. This opportunity exists when con-
sidering the industrial sector of CO2 emissions. Identifying areas
of lowest carbon capture (CC) cost will help to offset additional

Pcosts associated with installing and demonstrating first-of-a-kind
technology.

PThere have been many studies that have focused on the top four
emitting industries (i.e., iron and steel, cement, petroleum refining
and petrochemical). Farla et al. published one of the first industrial
assessments of CCS in 1995, focusing on the Netherlands, while Van-
sant published a chapter dedicated to characterizing the top-emit-
ting industries within the European Union [15,16]. In 2005, the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released its Spe-
cial Report on Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage, discussing the
emissions and CO2 purity from the industries already mentioned as
well as natural gas processing [7]. The United Nations Industrial
Development Organization (UNIDO) offers several CCS industrial
sectoral reports (biomass, high-purity, iron and steel, refineries and
cement) and collaborated with the International Energy Agency
(IEA) on a CCS technology roadmap [17(cid:1)22]. The IEA also published
a few sectoral reports of its own, as well as a comprehensive look at
reducing emissions from a multitude of industries [10,23,24]. A
more recent techno-economic assessment of the top four emitting
industries can be found in Kuramochi et al. [25].

PThe global CCS Institute published a report on CCS for iron and
steel production, as did Gielen [26,27]. The European Cement
Research Academy (ECRA) released a report on the potential for CCS
within the cement industry [28], while the U.S. EPA published a
report on reducing GHG emissions from the petroleum refining
industry and hydrogen production [29,30]. The National Energy
Technology Laboratory (NETL) examined several high and low purity
sources of CO2 and performed capture cost estimates for both retro-
fit and greenfield sites [31]. Xu et al., and Kheshgi and Prince have
discussed the value and sequestration potential of CO2 emitted dur-
ing ethanol fermentation [32,33]. Finally, Wilcox summarized vari-
ous industrial and power plant sources of CO2, as well as potential
geological sequestration and utilization opportunities. She then out-
lined the theory and calculation of thermodynamic minimum work
for separating CO2 from gaseous streams [34].

PAll of these documents briefly describe the industrial process and
summarize the techno-economic feasibility of capturing the CO2
emitted from the process. While each document provides salient
information on the top CO2-emitting industries, none of them con-
tain all of the information necessary to fully analyze industries for
their CCS potential or tie the CCS potential to geographical regions.
This work intends to provide an updated compendium of CCS oppor-
tunities for the United States.

PFinally, several papers have tied together CO2 sources and sinks to
create CO2 supply chain networks. For instance, Hasan et al. opti-
mized the CO2 supply chain network between all major CO2-emitting
sources and potential sequestration sites identified by the National
Carbon Sequestration Database and Geographic Information System
(NATCARB) [35]. Their spatial analysis considered different types of
CO2 sources, capture technologies, capture materials, CO2 pipelines,
and locations of storage sites. The resulting optimization estimated a
total annual cost of $58.1(cid:1)$106.6 billion to reduce 50(cid:1)80% of the
current stationary sourced CO2. While very comprehensive, the study
only includes CO2 emitted from the flue gas of fossil fuel combustion
and therefore omits the potential for capture of higher purity sources
of CO2, which would inevitably result in lower capture costs.

PMiddleton et al. examined high-purity CO2 sources (e.g., acid gas
removal, ammonia, ethanol, hydrogen and natural CO2 formations)
currently supplying CO2 for enhanced oil-recovery (EOR), and per-
formed a spatial and life-cycle assessment on potential supply sites
[36]. They found that much of the U.S. lies in a “CO2 desert”, or
greater than 500 km from the nearest high-purity CO2 source. They
also found that CO2 from natural formations have the largest carbon
footprint, suggesting that capturing CO2 from high-purity industry
sources have an even greater benefit for CO2 reduction since it would
leave naturally occurring CO2 in the ground, and limit CO2 emitted
from the extraction phase. This study, however, only includes certain
industries and restricts CO2 storage opportunities to EOR.

PThis review aims to collect all CC-relevant data into a single study
to enable an in-depth analysis of the CCS potential with a focus on
the contiguous U.S. The analysis includes a two-level perspective:
nationally across the U.S. and within individual facilities. The facil-
ity-level details include CO2-emitting process units and process

Pconditions (i.e., temperature, pressure and CO2 concentration),
which are required to understand how best to capture CO2 from dif-
ferent industries and to calculate the minimum capture work and
Sherwood cost estimation. A Sherwood plot correlates the relation-
ship between concentrations of a target substance with the cost to
separate it from the remaining components, as outlined by House
et al [37]. Top-emitting industries are considered, encompassing
dilute, high-purity, combustion, and process emissions. Spatial anal-
ysis in the form of geographic information systems (GIS) is then
used to bring together key CCS data within the U.S. to determine the
“low-hanging fruit” of CCS and to identify the facilities that have the
lowest CO2 capture cost.

2. Process CO2 versus combustion CO2

PWhen discussing CO2 emissions from industrial point sources, a
distinction can be made between “combustion” and “process” CO2.
Combustion emissions occur from burning carbonaceous fuels, such
as natural gas, coal and petroleum, while process emissions account
for all other CO2 released, usually from chemical reactions that are
required to produce a desired product. Reduction of iron ore into
iron, limestone into lime and water-gas shift reactions are examples
of such process reactions. In several instances, process and combus-
tion emissions can occur within the same unit. When process and
combustion emissions are mixed, there is the potential for higher
purity CO2 streams if new and innovative unit designs can separate
the process reactions from the heat requirements. These two types
of emissions will be discussed in greater detail as each industry is
considered.

PThe industries are ordered from the least concentrated source of
CO2 to the most concentrated. For each industry, a base case facility
is discussed. The base case was chosen to be the largest U.S. emitter
within that industry. Annual emission numbers for 2014 are taken
from the EPA's online FLIGHT database [38]. The process conditions
(i.e., temperature, pressure, CO2 concentration) for CC-relevant gas
streams are also provided.

ting industries. Fossil fuel combustion makes up the core of U.S. CO2

Pemissions, with petroleum combustion producing the most emis-
sions. However, petroleum combustion is mainly used in transporta-
tion (gasoline), which leaves coal as the greatest contributor to
stationary national emissions. In general, fossil-fueled electricity
generation is the greatest emitter of CO2, contributing over 55% to
total stationary emissions. Just under 75% of these emissions origi-
nate from coal, with most of the balance made up by natural gas.

PThe remaining emitters as shown in Table 1 account for approxi-
mately 19% of stationary emissions. Petroleum refining, which is the
second largest U.S. industry emitter, still emits 11 times less CO2
than power plants. With such a great disparity between power
plants and other industries, it can be easy to overlook the potential
of capturing industrial process CO2. Industrial process CO2 (also
referred to as “industry CO2” in this review) may be relatively small,
but it is unavoidable. As renewable energy generation continues to
increase and displace fossil fuel electricity generation, industry CO2
will constitute an increasingly larger portion of global emissions.
Moreover, unlike fossil fuel-fired power plants, many industries
have few or no CO2-free alternatives for manufacturing their prod-
ucts. While some research is underway to investigate novel produc-
tion pathways for some industries, they are highly unlikely to be
ready for commercialization on a time scale required to prevent cat-
astrophic climate change.

PFurthermore, many industries produce CO2 streams at much
greater purity than power plant flue gas. For example, natural gas
processing and ethanol fermentation can produce near pure streams
of CO2. Higher purity translates into lower capture costs, as will be
discussed in the following section. Low capture costs are important
for promoting first-of-a-kind CCS technology, whose costs can be fur-
ther reduced through learning and iterating until it is feasible to use
on larger, more dilute sources of CO2 such as power plants. There-
fore, industrial facilities may be the first adopters of CCS technology.

3. The cost of capture: minimum work and economic cost

3.1. Minimum work of separation

PA simplified CO2 separation schematic is shown in Fig. 1. The CO2
is removed from feed stream A, resulting in two product streams, i.
e., stream B with mostly CO2, and stream C with very little CO2.

PThe derivation of the minimum work is provided by House, et al
[37]. The minimum work for separation is achieved at isothermal,
isobaric conditions, reducing the minimum work equation into the
Gibb's Free Energy difference between the product and feed streams.
The streams are assumed to behave as ideal gases, since the gas
interactions are negligible in the streams considered [39].

PThe thermodynamic minimum work to separate CO2 from a gas

stream was calculated using Eq. (1):

PCO2. A 90% CO2 capture rate at 95% CO2 purity was assumed for all
CO2-relevant gas streams, except for those with initial (feed) stream
purities greater than 95%. In this case, CO2 purity that matched the
initial feed stream's purity were assumed, resulting in zero theoreti-
cal minimum work required for separation.

3.2. Sherwood analysis

PA Sherwood analysis was performed to estimate the cost of cap-
turing CO2 from the capture-relevant industrial gas streams. The
Sherwood plot (Fig. 2) illustrates that as concentration of a target
its separation costs
substance within a gas stream decreases,
increase. This relationship was developed by Thomas K. Sherwood in
1959 when he investigated how the market prices of a metal varied
with the initial concentration of the ore in the raw material. House,
et al extended this idea to the amount of CO2 present in a gas stream
that undergoes separation [37]. Fig. 2 displays various gas separation
technologies available today and the relationship between initial tar-
get concentrations and the separation (capture) costs. The data points
shown were calculated from Dr. Ed Rubin's Integrated Environmental
Control Model (IECM), which simulates gaseous capture technology
for power plant flue gas [40]. These costs are for Nth-of-a-kind tech-
nology, and only include capital cost. In the case of the CO2 data
points, this means compression costs are not included. The data
points represent the following separation technologies: selective cat-
alytic reduction (SCR) to remove parts per million (ppm)-level NOx;
wet flue gas desulfurization (WFGD) and lime spray drying (LSD) to
remove ppm-levels of SOx (corresponding to the high and low prices
of SOx separation, respectively); chemical absorption with MEA CO2
scrubbing for pulverized coal combustion (PCC) plant with 13% CO2
in the flue gas; and physical absorption with Selexol CO2 scrubbing
for the integrated combined cycle (IGCC) power plant with 36% CO2
in the flue gas. Due to the variety of separation technologies included
in the Sherwood plot, the subsequent capture cost estimates are
technology agnostic. Eq. (2) enumerates the linear fit between the
logarithmic prices of capture and the logarithmic target substance
concentration (in molar concentration).

PEq. (2) was used to calculate estimated CO2 capture costs for cap-
ture-relevant gas streams. Once again, these capture costs only
encompass capital costs, not compression costs for CCS.

3.3. The cost of CO2 capture

PA summary of the process conditions (i.e., CO2 concentration,
CO2-emitting process unit and temperature) are listed in Table 2.
These values were used to calculate the minimum work and esti-
mated financial costs for capturing CO2 from the top-emitting indus-
tries, with the results shown in Table 3. It is apparent that as the CO2
purity in the capture-relevant stream decreases, the associated mini-
mum work and capture costs increase. For any industrial process
that produces a stream with greater than 95% CO2 purity, the theo-
retical minimum work to capture it is near zero (given the

Passumption of 95% capture purity). Such industries include ethylene
oxide, hydrogen, ammonia, and ethanol production, as well as natu-
ral gas processing. Such pure streams of CO2 may only require dehy-
dration and compression. There is still an associated capital cost for
building the capture system in addition to operational and mainte-
nance costs, resulting in $14 per metric ton of CO2 capture on aver-
age. For comparison, the National Energy Technology Laboratory
(NETL) recently estimated carbon capture costs for high purity
industrial sources, resulting in costs of $11.68(cid:1)$23.09 per metric
ton of CO2 captured [31].

PIt should be emphasized that the Sherwood plot estimates Nth-
of-a-kind capture costs; therefore, as capture technology matures
for each industry, we should see greater convergence of costs. For
example, while amine-based post-combustion carbon capture at
cement plants currently have capture costs averaging around $110
per metric ton of CO2, it has been shown that chemical looping can
reduce costs to the $20(cid:1)$45 per metric ton of CO2 [41]. These
reduced costs align well with the $26(cid:1)$42 per metric ton of CO2
estimated by Sherwood analysis.

POn the other end, for a CO2 concentration of only 3% in the flue
gas stream, the minimum work required increases to 13 kJ per mole
of CO2 captured. The cost increases to $100 per metric ton of CO2
captured; in other words, there is about a 5-fold increase in capture
cost when the concentration decreases by a factor of approximately
30. The highest capture costs are associated with natural gas and
petroleum-fired power plants. Coal-fired power plants, the largest
emitter of stationary CO2, require on average 6(cid:1)8 kJ per mole of CO2
captured, about 25%(cid:1)50% less energy than capturing from natural
gas-fired power plants. Capturing CO2 from coal-fired power plants
costs between 30% and 56% less than capturing from natural gas-
fired plants.

POverall, the minimum work ranges from near zero up to approxi-
mately 13 kJ per mole of CO2 captured, with costs ranging from $14
to $100 per metric ton of CO2 captured. Industrial facilities have the
potential to demonstrate CCS technology at about one fifth of power
plant's capture costs, once again underscoring industrial process
CO2’s role in assisting the implementation of CCS technology.

3.4. Top CO2 emitters from the industrial sector

PMajor industrial emitters of CO2 are summarized in Figs. 3 and 4
according to CO2 purities, total emissions (MMT per annum) and
number of U.S. facilities reporting to the EPA GHGRP. These emission
sources remain promising targets for capture uptake due to the

Pgreater fraction of CO2 in their corresponding process exhaust
streams. Here, a thorough analysis of process design is presented,
with special consideration to process features that would lend to the
facile accommodation of capture technology. For each industry
described, a representative facility was chosen to illustrate the allo-
cation of CO2 emissions on-site. These base cases were chosen to be
the largest emitters reported in the EPA GHGRP. Emissions at other
facilities will vary.

P3.4.1. Petroleum refining

PThe U.S. is the world's largest refiner of crude oil. In 2012, around
144 U.S. refineries produced 803 MMT of petroleum products, net-
ting around 22% of global production's 3580 MMT of petroleum
products [42]. Around 170 MMT CO2 were emitted by the U.S refin-
ing industry in 2014, with 53.6 MMT CO2 of these emissions from
process reactions only [43]. In 2008, roughly 818 MMT CO2 were
emitted globally [21].

PPetroleum refineries produce various fuels and chemical feed-
stock through the distillation of crude oil followed by reforming and
cracking. While there are many sources of GHG emissions on site, as
seen in Fig. 5, the majority originate from combustion of fuels, and
almost all (over 97%) of the emissions are CO2 [21]. The four largest
sources of CO2 in a refinery are process heaters, utilities, fluid cata-
lytic cracker (FCC) and hydrogen production, though a given site
may not have all of these units [21].

P3.4.1.1. Process heaters.
PBetween 30(cid:1)60% of total refinery emissions
come from process heaters. Major units include steam reforming,
steam cracking, catalytic reforming and the distillation column
preheater. Steam reforming and steam cracking will be explored fur-
ther in the sections on hydrogen production and ethylene produc-
tion. In general, the CO2 content in the flue gases range from 8(cid:1)10%.
The CO2 content depends on which fuels are being combusted. In the
U.S., refineries mainly use natural gas and refinery fuel gas. Refinery

ylene production (28.1 (cid:1) 33.7 MMT) and ethylene oxide production (3.5 (cid:1) 3.7 MMT).

Pfuel gas (RFG) is roughly composed of 30% H2, 35% C1, and 35% C2 by
volume. CO2-emitting combustion reactions could then look like:

PThe exhaust temperature will also depend on the process type,
though the convection section of fired heaters can significantly
reduce the flue gas temperature [44]. For distillation, exit tempera-
tures are around 400 °C; for catalytic reformers, 495(cid:1)525 °C; for
steam methane reformers, 180(cid:1)200 °C at the stack; and for steam

temperatures range from 160(cid:1)200 °C for all process heaters [45,46].

P3.4.1.2. Utilities (Electricity and steam generation).
POn-site electricity
and steam generation can account for 20(cid:1)50% of refinery CO2 emis-
sions [21]. Coupled electricity and steam generation is called com-
bined heat and power (CHP). In refineries, RFG and supplemental
natural gas are combusted in air and sent to a gas turbine to create
electricity. The exhaust gases then pass through heat exchangers to
produce steam [47]. The exhaust gas contains approximately 4% CO2
by volume and exits between 160 °C and 190 °C [21,46].

PA fluid catalytic Cracker (FCC)
can account for 20(cid:1)50% of a refineries CO2 emissions. The FCC uses
heat, pressure and catalysts to break down large hydrocarbons into
more valuable products. During the reaction, carbon is deposited on
the catalyst, deactivating it. The catalyst is sent to regenerator for
decoking. The catalyst coke is combusted in air, producing CO and
CO2, the CO in the flue gas stream is converted to CO2 in a CO boiler,
and the boiler captures the heat released for steam production [21].
The stream exits the boiler at 160(cid:1)190 °C and contains 10(cid:1)20% CO2
by volume [46,21].

P3.4.1.4. Hydrogen production.
PHydrogen production can account for
5(cid:1)20% of total refinery CO2 emissions [21]. Roughly one third of all
U.S. refineries have on-site hydrogen production [29]. The relevant
process step is the purification of hydrogen. Hydrogen purification
may be completed either using CO2 scrubbing or pressure swing
absorption (PSA), though PSA has been the dominant technology
since the mid-1980s [48]. When CO2 scrubbing is used, an absorp-
tion column using an amine solution is used to specifically remove
CO2 from the product stream. The CO2 is then released from the
stripping column at high purities (»99%) and temperatures between
100(cid:1)120 °C [49,50]. PSA targets hydrogen specifically, with all other
including CO2, exiting as off-gas. Subsequently, PSA
impurities,
results in a lower concentration of CO2 in the gas stream, between

P30(cid:1)45% [51,18,16]. The gas stream exits at a temperature of 20(cid:1)40 °
C [49]. Refineries are more likely to employ PSA units due to greater
impurities in the feedstock.

PThe CO2 producing reaction occurs in two steps: steam methane
reformation (SMR) and water gas shift (WGS), as shown in Eqs. (5)
and (6), respectively.

PFig. 6 depicts a potential process configuration for petroleum
refining, based on ExxonMobil's Bt Site in Baytown, TX. Table 4 dis-
plays the CO2 emissions from the different various processes of the
plant. Process heating accounts for the greater number of emissions,
though the FCC is the largest single emitter of CO2. There was no
hydrogen production associated with this site in particular, though
there is a petrochemical plant located at the site. In this specific case
the process heating emissions were taken to be the stationary com-
bustion emissions listed for this facility under the U.S. GHGRP
reporting. These emissions likely include steam generation, though
data was not available to confirm this, and includes stationary com-
bustion that occurs for the petrochemical plant. The combination of
stationary combustion emissions skews the breakdown of emissions
at the base case facility, though it is likely that process heating would

Pproduce the majority of emissions even with adjusted numbers. As
stated previously, petroleum refineries located in the U.S. mainly
burn natural gas and RFG in process heaters. RFG consist of light C1
to C4 hydrocarbons, H2, H2S and other light top gases from distilla-
tion columns that are not condensed in the overhead condenser
[29].

PPetroleum refineries are distinctive among the CO2-intensive
industries in that there are numerous CO2-producing units. The dis-
perse nature of these units can make it difficult to implement CCS
without a common stack. For example, instead of trying to place CC
devices at each process heater exhaust stack, it may be best to focus
on the largest single CO2 emitters. Additionally, each refinery is
uniquely configured to produce a distinctive portfolio of products,
which depend on the petroleum feedstock used; therefore, a CC
design for one refinery will not likely fit another refinery.

PGiven the variety of CO2 emitting units in refineries, there is also
a wide range of minimum work for separation and capture costs.
The minimum work for separation ranges from 7.4 to 15.5 kJ/mol
CO2 captured excluding hydrogen production, and less than 4.0 kJ/
mol CO2 captured for hydrogen. The Sherwood analysis yielded a
capture cost ranging from $35 to $100 per MT of CO2 captured,
excluding H2 production. Hydrogen production capture costs range
between $14 and $28 per MT of CO2 captured; oil refineries would
likely incur the higher end of the H2 production capture cost range
due to the prevalence of PSA purification, which results in a more
dilute stream of CO2.

P3.4.2. Ethylene production

PThe U.S. ranks as the top producer of ethylene (C2H4), a feedstock
widely used to produce chemicals, such as polyethylene, ethylene
oxide and ethylene chloride [52]. In 2013, the U.S. produced 28.1
MMT of ethylene, capturing about 19.7% of world production [53].
Many ethylene production sites are co-located at petroleum refiner-
ies, since petroleum products serve as a feedstock for ethylene.
Around 18.8 MMT CO2 were emitted by U.S. ethylene production in
2014 [38].

P3.4.2.1. Process overview.
PFractional distillation is performed on nat-
ural gas and other feedstocks to obtain ethane (C2H6), propane
(C3H8) and/or butane (C4H10). The hydrocarbon feed (e.g., ethane
and propane) each undergo steam cracking, also known as pyrolysis,
at high temperatures. Steam crackers consist of furnaces which heat
the feedstock in tubes running through the combustion chamber. At
high temperatures, hydrocarbon chains break down, forming dou-
ble-bonded and lighter single-bonded hydrocarbons (Eqs. (7) and
(8)). For an ethane and propane mixture, the temperatures range
between 650 and 815 °C, while an ethane-only feed is cracked at
800(cid:1)850 °C [49].

C3H8 ! C2H4 þ CH4

ð8Þ
PThe cracked gaseous products, ranging from hydrogen to heavy
fuel oil are immediately quenched at 400 °C in a heat exchanger to
prevent the reactions from breaking down all hydrocarbons to meth-
ane, CH4 [54,55]. Further water injection into the product stream
cools it down to 40(cid:1)50 °C. The product stream is compressed and
fractionated to yield purer streams of ethylene, propylene, butadi-
ene, etc. The liquid stream leaves at the bottom of the column and
undergoes further processing and distillation. The ethane and pro-
pane streams are recycled back to the steam cracking unit. For
heavier feedstock such as naptha, an additional separation step is
required (e.g., cryogenic unit) to isolate the ethylene [56]. The light-
est off-gases (CH4, H2 and by-product propane, ethane) are com-
busted with natural gas to provide heat for the steam cracker or

Pother process heaters. The flue gas is then vented, releasing CO2 into
the atmosphere [15].

PThe light method of ethylene production prevails in the U.S.,
using natural gas, ethane, propane and butane as feedstock rather
than heavier hydrocarbons like naphtha. The latter three feedstocks
are known as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), and comprised around
90% of fresh feed in the U.S. in 2013. Of this, over 65% consisted of
ethane [15,56(cid:1)58].

PFig. 7 shows a process diagram for ethylene production, and
includes emissions numbers from the Westlake Petrochemical LP in
Sulphur, LA. The breakdown of CO2 emissions at this site is given in
Table 5. For the base case, there are ethylene production units and it
was assumed that all furnaces labeled with a reference to one of the
production units was part of the steam cracker for that production
unit. The facility is required by the U.S. GHGRP to report the fraction
of CO2 emitted that comes from burning ethylene off-gas. Overall,
about 12.4% of combustion emissions from the steam crackers were
attributed to ethylene off-gas. While ethylene off-gas only contrib-
utes 5.5% to total facility CO2 emissions, the steam crackers account
for 44.1% of total facility emissions. Flares associated with each of
the ethylene production units emit 49.3% of total facility CO2.

PCombustion of the off-gas and natural gas and other fossil fuels
leads to CO2 emissions. Steam cracking consumes the greatest
amount of energy at refineries and petrochemical plants, A negligi-
ble amount of CO2 is emitted during decoking of the furnace, in
which steam or a steam and air mixture react with carbon to pro-
duce CO and CO2 [59]. The concentration of CO2 in the flue gases
ranges from 7(cid:1)12% CO2, though it depends on the ratio of off-gas
(CH4, H2) to primary fuel and the exact composition of the off-gas
[7]. The flue gas temperature ranges between 160 °C to 215 °C [46].

PFarla et al. estimated that the cost of capturing and transporting
(by train) CO2 from a 10% CO2 flue gas stream is $45 per metric ton
of CO2 avoided [15]. Given that costs for avoided emissions are
higher than costs for captured CO2, and transportation was included
in Farla et al.’s analysis, the Sherwood cost estimations are slightly
higher at $46(cid:1)$62 per metric ton of CO2 captured.

PFinally, there are a couple of CC projects involving ethylene pro-
duction. Mitsui Chemicals in Japan are capturing the CO2 and using
it to make methanol while at least one ethylene plant is capturing
their CO2 and sending it for sequestration in Denmark's, Sweden's,
and Norway's Kattegat(cid:1)Skagerrak project [60,22,61].

P3.4.3. Cement production

PCement production is one of the largest CO2-emitting industries
globally, with the U.S. contributing 64.3 MMT of CO2 in 2014 [38]. In
2014, the U.S. produced 82.6 MMT of cement while the world pro-
duced a total of 4180 MMT. China accounts for the majority of pro-
duction, claiming 59.6% of global cement production. The runner-up,
India, only captured 6.6% of the production [62]. Although the U.S.
only makes up 1.9% of world production, any technology improve-
ments that occur from implementing CC in the U.S. can be extended
to countries like China.

P3.4.3.1. Process overview.
PCement is produced from calcium carbon-
ate (CaCO3), also known as limestone. Raw materials such as lime-
stone and the oxides of aluminum, silicon and iron are first grinded
and then travel to the preheater and the precalciner, where it is pre-
heated using flue gas from the rotary kiln. The limestone undergoes
its initial calcination, or reduction, in the precalciner, where addi-
tional heat is provided via fuel combustion (Eq. (9)). After these pre-
liminary processes, the limestone and other components enter the
rotary kiln to undergo further reduction into lime (CaO). Pulverized
coal or another fuel is blown into the kiln and combusted, providing
the heat required for the reactions. Different chemical reactions
occur within the temperature zones in the kiln. The first zone dehy-
drates the incoming material at 20(cid:1)900 °C. Calcination occurs at

PThe clinker pellets enter another grinder or mill where it is

grinded and mixed with gypsum, forming cement [63].

PThe major emitter of CO2 in cement production is the rotary kiln.
In the kiln, CO2 is emitted from both fuel combustion (usually coal)
and limestone calcination. In the U.S., coal is the primary fuel used in
the kiln, accounting for 59% of the heat consumed. Petroleum coke
and waste fuels make up the remainder of heat input [62]. Cement
production illustrates how process and combustion emissions can
be combined in a single unit. Just over half of the CO2 originates for
the calcination, while just under half of the emissions originate from
the combustion of fuel [64,65].

PThe kiln flue gas takes one of several paths. The flue gas may exit
at the end of the kiln, where it travels through an air quenching
cooler and an electrostatic precipitator before being vented, or it
may flow through the precalciner and preheater, where further CO2
is added during calcination of incoming limestone and the fuel

Pcombustion in the precalciner. A stream of flue gas and air may also
be siphoned off of the air quencher, bypass the kiln and flow directly
to the preheater as combustion air. Fig. 8 shows that the majority of
emissions come from the preheater exhaust stack rather than the air
quencher stack after the rotary kiln. The flue gas then continues to
an electrostatic precipitator before being vented. The CO2 content in
the flue gas ranges from 14% to 33% CO2, and exits at a temperature
between 150 °C and 350 °C. [64(cid:1)66]. The higher CO2 content is likely
associated with the additional calcination CO2 in the precalciner and
preheater.

PThe vast majority of U.S. cement plants, about 90%, use the more
energy efficient “dry process” [62]. The dry process uses less water
during the raw material grinding and crushing, requiring less heat
input for the dehydration stage.

PThe U.S. is home to one of the first cement plants with CC tech-
nology. Skyonic has retrofitted a cement plant in Texas with CC. The
CO2 is then converted into baking soda, creating an additional reve-
nue stream [67]. Other projects worldwide are also underway(cid:1)at
the European Cement Research Academy (ECRA), they are using oxy-
fuel configurations to capture the CO2 before the heat generation,
and in Norway and Taiwan, post-combustion CC projects are under-
way [23].

PFinally, the International Energy Agency's Greenhouse Gas pro-
gram (IEA GHG) estimated post-combustion captures costs of $161
per metric ton of CO2 avoided [23]. Their configuration included a
CHP plant to generate steam for regenerating the amine solution
used to capture the CO2. The Sherwood analysis yielded a capture
cost of $26 - $42 per metric ton of CO2 captured. However, as dis-
cussed earlier, chemical
looping produces carbon capture costs
between $20 and $45 per metric ton of CO2. Once again, the technol-
ogy agnostic and Nth-of-a-kind qualities of the Sherwood analysis
can produce estimates that may be lower than those from initial
technology options.

P3.4.4. Iron and steel production

PThe U.S. is the fourth largest producer of iron and steel in the
world at 5.3% of global production in 2014. China is the largest pro-
ducer, capturing 49.4% of the 1665.2 MMT global production, fol-
lowed by the EU at 10.1% and Japan at 6.6% [68]. Within iron and
steelmaking, iron production accounts for 70-80% of CO2 emissions
[26]. The U.S. emitted 55.4 MMT CO2 from iron and steel production
in 2014.

PThere are several routes for iron and steelmaking. Primary steel
production uses mostly iron to produce steel, while secondary steel
production uses mostly recycled scrap steel. Within primary steel
production, there are two major pathways: the blast furnace with
basic oxygen furnace (BF/BOF) and the direct-reduced iron with the
electric arc furnace (DRI/EAF). The CO2 is already captured at DRI/
EAF plants to improve the quality of the recycled reduction gas [27].
Secondary steel production always uses an electric arc furnace
(EAF). Within the U.S., about 40% of iron and steel industry uses the
BF/BOF process, while the remaining 60% uses the secondary EAF
process. Since the DRI/EAF process is not used in the U.S., it will not
be discussed here. Furthermore, the secondary EAF process emits
much less CO2 than the primary BOF process due to reduced energy
requirements by using recycled scrap steel instead of manufacturing
iron. Additionally, the recycled steel enters the process already
reduced, so the emissions-intensive iron-making stage is bypassed
and between 70(cid:1)80% of emissions are avoided [26]. While EAF con-
sume large amounts of electrical energy, fossil fuel combustion may
be off-set using alternative electricity generation sources.

PIn the case of CCS, the blast furnace in the BF/BOF process is the
largest single emitter of CO2 in the iron and steelmaking process;
therefore, the BF/BOF process will be the focus of this section.

P3.4.4.1. Process overview(cid:1)primary BF/BOF.
PPrimary iron and steel-
making facilities utilizing the blast furnace and basic oxygen furnace
pathway are known as “integrated steel mills”. First, coke is pro-
duced in a coke oven. There are two coke production configurations:
by-product and nonrecovery. Coal is carbonized in an almost oxy-
gen-free environment at high temperatures to create coke. Coke pro-
duction allows the carbon content to become concentrated [69]. In
by-product coke ovens, the off-gases are collected from the top of

Pthe oven. The tar, ammonia and light oil are removed, leaving light
hydrocarbons such as methane and hydrogen. This cleaned coke
oven gas (COG) can be combusted for heating the coke oven or other
processes or simply flared. In nonrecovery coke ovens, the off-gases
are not sent to a separation process; instead, the COG gas is burned
as-is, with heat recovered for steam or electricity generation [70].

PSinter production occurs in a separate unit as coke is produced. In
sintering, iron ore fines are heated to melt into pellets for the blast
furnace. Coke breeze (fine particles of coke) are used as the fuel
source [69]. Next, iron ore, sintered iron ore, limestone flux and coke
enter the blast furnace. The blast furnace transforms the iron ore
into pig iron, the precursor to steel. Hot air is blasted from the bot-
tom of the furnace, combusting with the coke to create carbon mon-
oxide (CO). The CO reacts with the iron ore to remove the oxygen,
reducing it to iron. The overall reduction reactions as well as individ-
ual reactions are shown in Fig. 9 [71]. The blast furnace is another
example of process and combustion emissions combined into a sin-
gle unit. The blast furnace gas (BFG) is the collected and combusted
to Cowper heaters to preheat the incoming blast air before being
vented.

PThe molten iron, also known as pig iron, is siphoned out of the
bottom of the BF and sent to the basic oxygen furnace (BOF) for
steelmaking. In the BOF, pig iron and steel scraps react with pure
oxygen to remove the remaining carbon and other impurities [72].
Around 80% of the BOF input material is pig iron, with scrap steel
making up the balance. The reduction reactions create mostly CO
with some CO2; initially, the BOF gas composition is 16% CO2 and
70% CO. The CO is combusted at the top of the furnace before being
vented, increasing the CO2 content to up to 42% [15]. The heat from
combustion can be used in a HRSG, or it can simply be cooled before
being cleaned. If needed, an extra decarburization step may occur to
further purify the steel and remove carbon.

P3.4.4.2. Process overview(cid:1)secondary EAF.
PSecondary EAF facilities are
known as “mini-mills”. The majority of their feedstock is recycled
steel in the form of scraps, while up to 10% of the feedstock can be
pig iron. The scrap steel is sent to an electric arc furnace (EAF), which
charges the metal and creates an electrical arc which melts the steel,
removing carbon and impurities. Alloying reagents and slag material

Pare included in the EAF for further refining [72]. Since coke produc-
tion, sintering and iron ore reduction are avoided, and fuels are not
necessarily combusted on-site for electricity needs, much less CO2 is
emitted at mini-mills.

Pand capture cost than if only natural gas had been used. The theoret-
ical minimum work to capture the CO2 from the blast furnace is
5.3(cid:1)6.4 kJ per mole CO2 captured, while the Sherwood capture cost
is $31(cid:1)$35 per MT of CO2 captured.

P3.4.4.3. Process conditions(cid:1)BF/BOF.
PCarbon dioxide is emitted from
the combustion of coke breeze in the sintering plant, the combustion
of coke oven gas in the coke oven, the blast furnace, and the basic
oxygen furnace, in addition to other process heating and flaring. The
CO2 concentrations are as follows: 5(cid:1)10% in the sintering plant
exhaust gas, 25% in the coke oven exhaust, 20(cid:1)27% from the blast
furnace (latter concentration from combustion of BFG), and 16(cid:1)42%
from the BOF (latter concentration from combustion of BOF gas).
Although exact exhaust temperatures were not found for coke oven
or sintering plants, it is reasonable to assume exhaust from all four
processes have temperatures around 100 °C, as most streams are
cleaned and cooled before being vented [25,27]. All exhaust streams
are at 1 bar.

PAs mentioned previously and confirmed by the emissions break-
down for the iron and steel base case (Fig. 10), the blast furnace is
the greatest single source of CO2 at iron and steel plants. Though
process heaters combined account for 59% of the base case's emis-
sions (Fig. 11), they are dispersed throughout the plant without a
common stack, making CC difficult. In the blast furnace, it is impor-
tant to note once more that both process and combustion CO2 are
combined into one vessel. Although it is unclear how much of the
CO2 emitted from the blast furnace are process versus combusted,
determining a way to separate the combustion from the reduction
reactions could lead to a purer stream of CO2 from the blast furnace
and reduced cost for CO2 capture.

PTable 6 shows the breakdown of the CO2 emissions by fuel at the
base case plant. BFG accounts for 78% of the CO2 emissions from
combustion, while natural gas (primary fuel) only accounts for 17%.
The combustion of BFG produces CO2 concentrations at 20(cid:1)27%,
higher than the typical natural gas CO2 concentration of 3(cid:1)5% for
gas turbines or 7(cid:1)10% for boilers, resulting in lower minimum work

P3.4.5. Ethylene oxide production

PThe U.S. is one of the world's largest producer of ethylene oxide
(EO), along with China and Saudi Arabia. The U.S. alone is responsible
for approximately 15% of global production in 2013 [73]. [74] Like
ethylene, EO is widely used in the chemical industry, and is often
produced at petrochemical plants located at or near refineries. CO2
emissions from EO production numbered at 1.3 MMT CO2 in 2014;
while this is small compared to other industries, the purity of EO's
process streams still make it an attractive option for carbon capture
[73].

PThere are two types of EO production pathways: air oxidation or
direct oxygen oxidation. In both cases, ethylene is oxidized into eth-
ylene oxide. The majority of U.S. production uses the direct oxidation
pathway [75]. Both pathways are described in this section.

P3.4.5.1. Process overview(cid:1)air oxidation.
PEthylene, the feedstock for
EO, and air enter a reactor with a silver catalyst at a temperature
between 200 °C to 300 °C and pressure between 10 to 30 bar and
undergoes oxidation. The reactor product stream flows to the pri-
mary absorber, where water adsorbs the EO, and the dissolved EO
stream travels to the desorber unit, while a portion of the overhead
stream is sent back to the reactor as recycle. The remaining overhead
gases pass through another coupled secondary, or purge, reactor and
EO water absorber. Nitrogen (N2) and CO2 are vented from the purge
absorber, resulting in a 30% CO2 content stream. The EO then enters
a desorption unit to recycle the water, and finally enters a stripper
distillation column to remove any remaining N2, CO2, and other
impurities. Due to the N2, the CO2 concentration is once again
diluted to 30% by volume in the exit stream [76]. The purified EO
stream continues to further processing to create ethylene glycol and

via near-pure oxygen, ethylene and oxygen similarly enter a reactor
with silver catalyst. The reaction temperature and pressure are
slightly different than in the air oxidation pathway; temperatures
range from 200 °C to 300 °C, with pressures between 10 to 30 bar
[18]. The reactor product stream enters a primary absorber column,
where once again water physically adsorbs EO. The overhead gases,
including CO2, enter a CO2-specific absorber column using the hot
potassium carbonate process (HPCP). The potassium carbonate
absorbs the CO2, and travels to the desorption column to recycle the
absorbent and release the CO2, and an almost pure stream (»99%) of
CO2 is vented.

PThe EO-rich product stream, dissolved in water, enters a desorp-
tion unit for regeneration. The EO stream then heads to the final

Ppurification step, the stripper unit, where the stripper removes any
remaining light inert gases such as CO2, though only a small amount
is released. The EO stream continues on for further processing [76].

PFig. 13 shows the process diagram for ethylene oxide production
for the Equistar Chemical plant in Pasadena, TX, where over 95% of
on-site emissions come from the purification of ethylene oxide.

P3.4.5.3. Process conditions.
PIn the air oxidation pathway, CO2 is emit-
ted from a secondary reactor and the stripper column at a concentra-
tion of 30%. The oxygen oxidation pathway releases CO2 from the
CO2-desportion unit and the stripper, resulting in »99% purity CO2
[17,15]. In all cases, the exit CO2 stream has a temperature between
100 °C to 120 °C after chemisorption [49].

PEO production and the following sections illustrate high purity
sources of CO2. CO2 capture is actually already built into the EO
industry through the purification steps. The only steps needed for an
almost pure stream of CO2 is dehydration and compression. EO

Pproduction is an excellent candidate for implement CCS technology,
since direct oxygen oxidation is prevalent in the U.S. and results in a
low-cost opportunity.

PFarla et al. estimated that CO2 capture from EO production would
only cost $9 per metric ton of CO2 avoided in 1995, which would
translate to about $14 in 2014 dollars [15]. The Sherwood analysis
estimated costs to be between $14 and $28 per metric ton of CO2
captured. Since CO2 avoided costs are generally higher than its corre-
sponding CO2 captured costs, Farla's cost estimate is quite a bit lower
than the Sherwood estimate.

P3.4.6. Hydrogen production

PIn 2008, the U.S. produced 10(cid:1)11 MMT of hydrogen (H2), captur-
ing between 25 and 27% of global production. The majority of H2
production is for captive use in the chemical and refinery industries,
indicating that H2 production occurs at the same site as or very close
to other major sources of CO2. “Captive” use refers to H2 produced
and consumed on-site, while “merchant” H2 is produced on-site and
sold to other companies. Furthermore, H2 production may be “on-
purpose” or produced as a “byproduct” of another process. On-pur-
pose merchant production accounted for 15.3% of 2006 production,
while on-purpose captive accounted for 48.7% of production.
Byproduct production accounted for around 36% of total U.S. produc-
tion in 2006. The majority of byproduct H2 come from catalytic
reforming at petroleum refineries and chlorine-alkali production,

Pwhich do not emit process CO2 [77]. Approximately 60 MMT of CO2
were emitted from H2 production in 2008, with over 70% of emission
coming from on-purpose captive applications such as petroleum
refineries and ammonia plants. Merchant H2 outside of these indus-
tries accounted for almost all of the remaining CO2 (Table 7). The U.
S. GHGRP reported 42.5 MMT CO2 from H2 production in 2014,
though these emissions exclude captive H2 production in the ammo-
nia industry. The U.S. GHGRP includes emissions from refinery H2
production within the H2 industry tally.

PIn the U.S., around 95% of H2 production uses natural gas reform-
ing, also called steam methane reforming (SMR); this section will
focus on SMR as the main production process [78]. Finally, although
an increasing amount of H2 production is purified using PSA rather
than CO2 scrubbing with an amine solution, both processes will be
discussed.

PNatural gas is the feedstock of H2 produc-

tion using the steam methane reformation (SMR) technique. Before
entering the reactor, the natural gas undergoes hydrodesulphuriza-
tion to remove any H2S that could poison the catalysts in the
reformer [79]. The natural gas then enters the SMR unit, where it
reacts with steam at high temperatures (700 °C(cid:1)1000 °C) at pres-
sures of 3(cid:1)25 bar [78]. At this point, CO2 is produced through the
combustion of methane and through the SMR reaction (Eqs. (10) and
(11)). However, unlike in the cement rotary kiln or the iron blast fur-
nace, the combustion and process reactions are separate. The com-
bustion occurs in the furnace, while the reaction takes place in
reactor within the SMR furnace (Fig. 14). The combustion flue gases
contain CO2 concentrations around 7(cid:1)10%, and exit at temperatures
between 160 °C and 200 °C [7]. After the SMR reactor, the CO2 con-
centration is around 7(cid:1)12% by volume, while H2 makes up 69(cid:1)78%
[49].

Pat a temperature between 100 °C and 120 °C [49]. In both cases, car-
bon capture systems would be placed after the H2 purification step.

PDue to the range in CO2 purity in target streams, the Sherwood
analysis cost for capture ranges from $14 per MT of CO2 captured for
high purity to $28 per MT of CO2 captured for lower purities. The lit-
erature estimates a cost of $5 to $70 per MT of CO2 net captured,
which is equivalent to CO2 avoided; the extremes are quite a bit
lower and higher than the Sherwood costs [82].

PWhile PSA is becoming more prevalent in the H2 production
industry, a simple way to promote CCS is to encourage new facilities
to use the CO2 scrubbing purification method instead. The PSA train
could also be expanded to include CO2 removal. The hydrogen pro-
duction industry may also prove useful in providing experience for
pre-combustion CC technology, as both require SMR and WGS units
to produce H2 as fuel while capturing CO2.

P3.4.7. Ammonia processing

PThe U.S. produced 11.3 MMT of ammonia (NH3) in 2014, captur-
ing 6% of the world's 176.3 MMT of production, and trailing China,

PThe H2 product stream then enters a two-stage water-gas shift
(WGS) converter to produce more H2 and the high temperature
WGS reactor contains iron oxide catalysts at 300 °C(cid:1)450 °C, while
the low temperature WGS reactor contains copper and zinc oxide
catalysts are 200 °C(cid:1)250 °C. The CO2 content in the stream after the
WGS converter is 15(cid:1)20% by volume, while the H2 content is 77 to
79% [49,18].

PThe final step in H2 production is purification. Hydrogen may be
purified in several ways. The most common are by pressure swing
absorption (PSA) and chemical absorption of CO2 followed by metha-
nation. Fig. 15 shows the process overview for hydrogen production,
and displays emission numbers from Air Products Port Arthur Facil-
ity, where the hydrogen purification produces 74% of the total on-
site CO2 emission.

PIn PSA, as shown in Fig. 16, H2 is targeted for removal, with all
remaining impurities being vented. This method is popular amongst
petroleum refineries, as there are many impurities in the syngas
stream. The CO2 is diluted by the other gases, resulting in a CO2 con-
tent between 30 to 45% CO2 [18,16]. The gas is vented at 20 °C to 40 °
C and 1 bar [50,80]. The H2 stream then undergoes methanation to
remove any remaining CO2 and CO as CH4.

PWhen CO2 amine scrubbing is used, a much higher purity of CO2
is released. During desorption, the CO2 exits at 98.5 to 100% [81,18]

PRussia and India. China led with 33% of global production [83]. In the
U.S., around 88% of ammonia went into fertilization production [84].
About 9.4 MMT of CO2 were released in the U.S. in the same year,
according to the U.S. GHGRP. The emissions include captive hydro-
gen production emissions, but do not include CO2 captured for urea
production.

PHydrogen production and ammonia have many process similari-
ties. To produce ammonia, hydrogen must first be produced and
then reacted with nitrogen, usually sourced from air. Two-stage
steam methane reforming (SMR) is the main ammonia production
pathway used in the U.S. In 2011, around 92.5% of ammonia was pro-
duced using natural gas feedstock [85]. Partial oxidation is another
potential pathway, but will not be discussed further in this section.
The process CO2, formed during SMR and WGS, is emitted during the
H2 purification step. However, within the ammonia industry, most

Phydrogen is purified using CO2 amine absorption or HPCP producing
high purity CO2 streams for carbon capture [86].

P3.4.7.1. Process overview.
PNatural gas first undergoes desulfurization
to remove any H2S that can contaminate the catalysts in the reactors.
The natural gas and steam enter the primary reformer, which produ-
ces CO and H2 at temperatures of 730 °C (Eq. (10)) [87]. The product
stream, containing 7(cid:1)12% CO2, 69(cid:1)78% H2 and 9(cid:1)13% CO by vol-
ume, then enters the secondary reformer. Compressed air is injected
into the secondary reformer reactor to obtain a 3:1 ratio of H:N
atoms for ammonia synthesis [88]. Partial oxidation of CH4 also
occurs, yielding CO, H2, and H2O (Eq. (12)) [15]. After the secondary
reformation, the product stream contains 7(cid:1)12% CO2, 55(cid:1)57% H2,
22(cid:1)24% N2, and 12(cid:1)15% CO by volume [49].

PThe product stream then enters a high temperature and lower
temperature WGS reactor, while the H2 and N2 streams are then
purified using CO2 scrubbing, as PSA would also remove the N2
needed for ammonia synthesis. The CO2 absorption may be per-
formed using an amine solution or potassium carbonate (HPCP).
CO2 is released at purities of 98.5 to 100% and a temperature
between 100 °C and 120 °C [49]. The H2 and N2 product stream
then undergoes methanation to remove any residual CO and CO2
as CH4 [87].

PThe N2 and H2 are then reacted together to produce ammonia,
and the ammonia undergoes further separation. If urea is produced
on-site, the CO2 from the absorber column is sent to reactor so that
it may react with the ammonia to form urea (NH2CONH2) in a two-
step reaction (Eqs. (13) and (14)).

PThe two main points of divergence from the hydrogen production
process described previously are the secondary reformer and the
CO2-specific removal step using either amine or potassium carbon-
ate. As with hydrogen production, CO2 is released from two main
locations: the amine desorption unit and the steam reformer flue
gas. The amine absorption unit, which contains process CO2, exits at
purities of 98.5% to 100% CO2 and a temperature between 100 °C and
120 °C. The flue gas, containing combustion CO2, exits with a CO2
concentration between 7 and 10% CO2 at a temperature between
160 °C and 200 °C.

PFig. 17 shows the base case ammonia plant located in Donalds-
ville, LA. Just under 60% of the 5.32 total MMT CO2 come from the
CO2 desorption, though some of this CO2 is used for urea production
and sold to other companies. The combustion CO2 from the reform-
ers account for around 19% of the CO2 emitted, with the urea boiler
making up the balance.

PThe high purity CO2 stream results in a Sherwood cost of $14 per
MT of CO2 captured. Rubin estimated capture costs of $5 to $70 per
ton of net CO2 captured for ammonia, hydrogen and natural gas
processing plants [82]. Once again, while these estimates are for
avoided CO2, the extremes are much lower and higher than the Sher-
wood estimates.

P3.4.8. Natural gas processing

PThe U.S. is the world leader in natural gas production and subse-
quently natural gas processing. In 2014, the U.S. produced 20.7% of
the world's supply [89]. In 2014, 56 MMT CO2 were emitted in the U.
S. Combustion CO2 from process heaters comprised 65% of total
emissions, while process emissions from venting and flaring made
up the balance. Within process emissions, 62% of CO2, or 22% of total
CO2, came from acid gas removal (AGR). AGR mainly consists of
removing CO2 from natural gas produced at the well [90,91].

P3.4.8.1. Process overview.
PNatural gas produced at a wellhead con-
tains mainly methane (CH4), but also smaller amounts of ethane,
butane, propane and pentane as well as undesirables such as water,
H2S, CO2, He and N2 [92]. The acid gases H2S and CO2 “sour” the gas
mixture; removing these gases “sweetens” the natural gas and con-
stitutes one part of the cleaning process [18].

PThere are four main natural gas processing steps: oil and conden-
sate removal, water removal (dehydration), acid gas removal (sweet-
ening), and separation of natural gas liquids. The oil and condensate
removal occurs at the wellhead. Condensate, also known as natural
gasoline, consists of heavier hydrocarbons (C5 and heavier) that are
liquid at ambient T [92]. The product stream is then dehydrated,
either at the wellhead or further downstream.

PThe raw natural gas travels from the wellhead to the processing
plant to undergo AGR. Initial CO2 content in raw natural gas can vary
from 2% to 70% by volume [18]. In AGR, H2S and CO2 impurities are
removed to meet natural gas pipeline specifications, usually less
than 2% CO2 by volume. An amine absorption system or membrane
separate the H2S and CO2 from the natural gas stream. Over 95% of
AGR processes use amine absorption [92,93]. The acid gas stream
then enters a Claus process unit, where the H2S is converted to ele-
mental sulfur and recovered. A relatively pure stream of CO2
(96(cid:1)99% by volume) exits the Claus unit. The CO2 stream is either
incinerated, vented or captured for enhanced oil recovery (EOR)
[18,94].

PThe final processing step is to separate the natural gas liquids.
The stream is fractionated into valuable hydrocarbon streams
including methane, ethane, propane, butane and pentane and
heavier. Fig. 18 depicts the natural gas processing system. Acid gas
removal accounted for over 58% of on-site CO2 emissions. The

sions were 3.02 MMT.

Premaining CO2 comes almost exclusively from stationary combus-
tion, though a fraction of CO2 is emitted from flaring.

PCarbon dioxide is emitted from process heaters and the AGR unit.
Carbon capture technology would be best placed after the Claus
unit, due to a high purity of CO2, between 96(cid:1)99% by volume [18].
The temperature of the exit stream is between 100 °C and 120 °C at a
pressure of 1 bar [95(cid:1)97]

PCapturing CO2 at natural gas processing is relatively low cost, as
the amine system already performs the most energy and economi-
cally expensive step in CCS. Some natural gas processing sites
already capture their CO2 for EOR purposes, indicating that experi-
ence in CC already exists. The Sherwood analysis estimates a cost of
$14 per MT of CO2 captured, while Rubin once again estimates a cost
of $5 to $70 per MT of CO2 avoided [82].

P3.4.9. Ethanol production

PThe majority of ethanol is produced in the U.S. and Brazil. In
2013, the U.S. produced 13,321 millions of gallons of corn-based eth-
anol, capturing 57% of global production. Brazil produced 6267 mil-
lions of gallons of sugar cane-based ethanol in the same year [98].
More than 30% of the U.S. merchant CO2 market is sourced from eth-
anol plants due to the almost pure stream of CO2 that is released
during fermentation [99]. In 2014, around 40.1 MMT of CO2 were
released from fermentation alone (see Table 1 footnotes).

PEthanol may be produced from corn or sugar cane. Since the vast
majority of U.S. ethanol production uses corn feedstock, the corn
ethanol process will be the focus of this section [32,100]. Further-
more, ethanol production may use dry-milling or wet-milling. More
than 80% of U.S. production uses dry-milling, though both will be
described [101].

PMilling is the first step in eth-

anol production. Entire corn kernels are ground into a flour called
“meal”, keeping all grain components together. Water is added in
the slurry stage, creating “mash”. Enzymes are added to convert
starch to simple sugars, and ammonia is added for pH control and
yeast nutrient. The mash is next sent to a high temperature cooker
to kill off bacteria. The mash is then cooled before traveling to the
fermenters, where yeast is introduced. The fermentation step can
take from 40 to 50 hours. During this, the glucose in the simple sug-
ars is converted to ethanol and CO2 (Eq. (15)).
C6H12O6 ! 2CO2 þ 2C2H5OH

ð15Þ
POnce fermentation is complete, the ethanol is separated from the
solid grain residue “stillage” in a distillation column. The ethanol is
then dehydrated to 200 proof using molecular sieves. Finally, a dena-
turant is added to the ethanol to make it undrinkable. The product is
stored until shipment [99]. Fig. 19 visualizes the dry-milling process,
and includes emission numbers from the ADM Corn Processing facil-
ity in Cedar Rapids, IA.

POn average within the U.S., about 35% of the CO2 emitted from
ethanol plants comes from combustion, while the remaining 65%
comes from fermentation. Although biogenic CO2 is not recorded
under the U.S. GHGRP, ethanol plants nonetheless emit a significant
amount of CO2 and should be considered candidates for CCS. CCS
combined with biofuels allow for “carbon negative” fuels, or fuels
that sequester more CO2 during production than is released upon
combustion.

P3.4.9.2. Process overview(cid:1)wet-milling.
PThe main difference between
wet-milling and dry-milling is the separation of grain components
in the first step. In wet-milling, the corn kernels are soaked in water

Pand dilute sulfurous acid to separate the grain into starch, protein
and fiber components. The components are then isolated from each
other as they travel through a set of grinders and separators. The
fiber and steeping liquor from the first step are dried to produce
corn gluten feed. The feed is sold to the livestock industry. The pro-
tein, in the form of gluten, is filtered and dried to make corn gluten
meal for feed. The remaining starch and water may then be pro-
cesses in one of three ways: fermented into ethanol, dried and sold
as modified corn starch, or processed into corn syrup. If ethanol is
made, it follows the same steps as discussed in the dry-milling pro-
cess [99].

the fermenter at purities of 98(cid:1)99% by volume, and almost ambient
conditions of 35 °C and 1 bar [33,102]. At such high CO2 purity, Xu
et al. estimated a cost of $6 to $12 per MT of CO2 captured, a bit
lower than the Sherwood estimates of $14 per MT of CO2 captured
[33]. The low cost of capture coupled with industry experience in
capturing CO2 for the merchant market create a very favorable situa-
tion for CC. Adding CC to ethanol plants appear to be one of the most
viable options explored in this work [17,60].

4. Why country-level emissions?

PAlthough the focus in this review is on opportunities to apply CCS
to U.S.-based industries, it is equally important to investigate CO2
emissions on a global scale to develop a broader understanding and
complete the picture of CC's potential. This is considered a first step
toward developing a clear pathway, with the hope that the U.S. will
take the lead on some of these projects. Combining facility locations
with the costs of carbon capture allows for outlining the “low-hang-
ing fruit” of CC. Once these facilities have been identified, spatial
analysis is further used to match CO2 sources with potential sinks.
Only by zooming out from a facility to a national perspective can we
truly realize the impact of CCS and create project pathways for
implementation. Fig. 20 provides a nationwide visualization of CO2
industrial process-only
emissions, while Fig. 21 showcases

Pemissions. With these in hand, we can begin to regionally character-
ize emissions and CCS opportunities.

PPetrochemical plants (ethylene, ethylene oxide) and petroleum
refineries are grouped along the Texan and Louisianan Gulf Coast, as
well as near New Jersey ports. California (Bay Area and Los Angeles)
and Washington (Seattle) also house refineries, in addition to hydro-
gen plants. Many hydrogen facilities are located near or at refineries,
or are scattered throughout the Midwest. Similarly, ammonia plants,
which use hydrogen feedstock, are located near hydrogen sites, pre-
dominantly in the Midwest and Louisiana.

PNatural gas processing and ethanol production produce nearly
pure streams of CO2. Though these sources tend to emit smaller
amounts of CO2, there are many of them and they tend to be near
one another. Clusters of natural gas processing operations are found
in North Dakota, down through Wyoming, Colorado and New Mex-
ico, with the majority of natural gas processing occurring in Okla-
homa, Texas and Louisiana. Ethanol production is prevalent in the
Indiana and
Midwest, particularly Iowa, Minnesota,
Nebraska. Several facilities produce a significant amount of CO2, on
par with larger emitters like cement.

Illinois,

PCement production, lime production, hydrogen production and
iron and steel manufacturing tend to emit large amounts of CO2
from single facilities, making them attractive for CC technology. Iron
and steel plants are generally aggregated along the north and east-
ern parts of the Midwest (northern Minnesota, Michigan, Illinois,
Indiana, Ohio) and parts of the East Coast (Pennsylvania and New
Jersey to South Carolina). Cement production facilities, which consis-
tently emit large amounts of process CO2, are scattered fairly evenly
across the U.S. Finally, lime production is located primarily in the
interior of the U.S., within the Midwest and the West.

POverall, ethanol and ammonia production and natural gas proc-
essing produce the purest streams of CO2. Hydrogen, cement and
lime production consistently produce the greatest amount of process
CO2, followed by iron and steel manufacturing. Table 8 lists the top
ten CO2 emitters by state for each category of emissions, while
Fig. 21 visualizes process-only CO2 emissions on a state level. Texas
trumps all other states, and electricity generation CO2 greatly influ-
ences the top capture-relevant CO2 emitters.

4.1. Process versus combustion CO2

PProcess CO2 has been the main focus of the discussion thus far,
but many facilities emit significant amounts of combustion CO2 for
process heating and other thermal needs. Fig. 22 depicts and com-
pares process emissions to combustion emissions at each facility. On
the whole, it appears that combustion emissions are fairly balanced
with process CO2. Cement and lime production facilities tend to
have significantly more process CO2 to combustion. The same is true
for a few ammonia, iron and steel plants and ethanol plants, though
the difference is not nearly as large for ethanol plants. The opposite
is true for refineries, petrochemical and hydrogen plants, with com-
bustion emissions only slightly greater than process emissions.

4.2. CO2 sources by purity

PCombining data on location, quantity and purity of the CO2 point
sources creates a picture of the CC potential within the U.S. and iden-
tifies the “low-hanging fruit”. Fig. 23 shows such an image, with the
CO2 quantities and qualities visualized. Each color corresponds to
the CO2 purity of the capture-relevant stream, with darker colors
indicating higher purity. In this case, petroleum refineries were con-
sidered more concentrated than coal power plants since the cap-
ture-relevant process CO2 neglected process heating. Process
heating is the lower end of the refining CO2 concentration range;
although the 3(cid:1)20% range is shown for consistency in this work, in
reality the CO2 sources shown are likely to have concentrations
between 10(cid:1)20%.

PHydrogen production was considered to be within the 30(cid:1)45%
purity range, since this is associated with the PSA purification pro-
cess, which is increasingly used in industry. However, it should be
noted that some of these hydrogen plants could also be in the
96(cid:1)99% CO2 range.

PThe largest pure CO2 emitters (96(cid:1)100% CO2) are ammonia and
ethanol, with a few natural gas processing plants included. Hydrogen
is the next purest stream of CO2, but is already potentially more than
half the concentration of CO2 as the pure streams (30(cid:1)45% CO2). For-
tunately, this does not correspond to a tripling of capture costs at the
lower concentration end; costs only increase from $14 to $28 per ton
of CO2 captured.

PSince many of these high purity sources are located in the Mid-
west and along the Gulf Coast, these are the regions of the U.S. that
have the greatest potential for first-of-a-kind CC technology. In other
words, the Midwest and the Gulf Coast hold the “low-hanging fruit”
of CCS. More specifically, the central and southern Midwest, and
Gulf Coast are the regions that CCS pilot plants and demonstration
projects should target, as they will result in the cheapest initial cap-
ture costs, and are co-located with potential sequestration sites
(Fig. 25). If all of these high purity sources (pure sources plus hydro-
gen) were captured, it would account for about 5% of total U.S. car-
bon emissions. While this is small relative to the CO2 reduction
required to mitigate climate change, it is nonetheless a first step to
deploying CCS on a wider scale.

PA few facilities also already appear to use CC technology to pro-
vide CO2 for injection into enhanced oil recovery (EOR) sites
(Fig. 24). Ammonia plants in Louisiana, northern Texas and North
Dakota are connected via CO2 pipelines to nearby EOR fields. There
are other numerous industrial CO2 sources by these pipelines,
including natural gas processing, hydrogen, lime, and petrochemical
production plants and petroleum refineries. While it is unclear
whether any of these facilities are used to provide CO2 to the fields,
it nevertheless shows the potential of tapping into these existing
CO2 resources for utilization and leaving natural CO2 in the ground.
Despite the fact that EOR is a CO2 utilization rather than sequestra-
tion, as the CO2 is not monitored or verified to remain underground,
it still provides an economic incentive for capturing CO2 from nearby

for building the initial CC fleet.

4.3. A note on CO2 utilization

PIn addition to reliable storage, carbon dioxide utilization (CCU)
and reuse has gained traction as an alternative fate for captured CO2.
This route has the advantage of creating revenue from a waste prod-
uct, which in theory could be applied to offset capture, compression
and transport costs. Additionally, this route may be advantageous or
desirable in areas where reliable storage opportunities do not exist,
or exist at distances which are cost prohibitive from a transportation
perspective. Carbon dioxide utilization opportunities include, but
are not limited to, EOR, mineral carbonation, food and beverage
processing, urea production and yield boosting, liquid fuel produc-
tion, and many other avenues using CO2 as a chemical feedstock.
Several reviews have presented these opportunities in great detail
[103(cid:1)107].

PIt is important to consider several factors when weighing the
potential benefits of CCU. First, very few utilization opportunities
exist at the scale to make a direct impact on climate. Of current
opportunities, EOR owns the significant majority of the CO2 utiliza-
tion market. Even with this large share [108], US demand (ca. 70 Mt/
a) would only offset 1% of annual US CO2 emissions. One utilization
opportunity with sufficient scalability to impact climate is CO2 to
fuels, with future potential cited at the gigatonne scale [109]. How-
ever, oxidized fuels immediately recommit CO2 to the atmosphere;
thus, it is important to consider the period of carbon fixation if such
utilized CO2 is to be counted against climate change.

PCO2 conversions are often energy-intensive due to the thermody-
namic stability of fully oxidized carbon. Hence, full life-cycle assess-
ments will often reveal that carbon utilization is carbon positive
using traditional grid power and conventional routes for H2 produc-
tion, emitting more CO2 than is consumed during utilization
[110,111]. Coupling of these opportunities to renewable energy is
often a knee-jerk solution to this unfavorable carbon balance; how-
ever, detailed analyses must be performed at the regional level to
determine if it is not more efficient to place such renewable energy
directly into the power grid. Even in the face of carbon-positive utili-
zation, in some cases, CO2-based processing is less carbon intensive
than the incumbent process. For example, an industrial case study
shows CO2 emissions reductions on the order of 11(cid:1)19% when CO2
is employed in polyurethane production [112]. Nevertheless, these
collective points serve to highlight the complexities in considering
CCU, and the necessity for reliable LCA data for gaining proper
insights; thus, such opportunities are not explored in this review.

5. Conclusions

PFacility-level analysis of the top CO2-emitting industries is
required to fully understand the potential for CCS in the United
States. Capture costs and minimum separation work can be calcu-
lated when the process conditions of capture-relevant CO2 streams
are known. Although fossil-fueled power plants dominate stationary
CO2 emissions, other industries may provide a cheaper pathway
toward CCS deployment. Many industrial processes also lack CO2-
free alternatives, making CCS necessary for their future success.

PIt is useful to know which process unit is the largest CO2 emitter
within an industry. Capture technology implemented at that one

Punit will maximize emissions reduction for a minimal cost. Indus-
tries with a single large CO2 source unit, such as cement production
and iron and steel manufacturing, are therefore attractive CCS candi-
dates. However, even in these cases, process heating emissions can
still account for more than half of all on-site CO2. Process heaters
tend to be comprised of multiple units, further exacerbating CCS
installation challenges.

PPetroleum refineries face a unique challenge with their myriad
processes. It would be very problematic to retrofit CCS technology

Ponto many individual emitting units, and choosing a single unit may
not have as much of an impact as in other industries. Additionally,
refineries’ distinct site configurations make it difficult to determine
a CC implementation standard across the industry. Several indus-
tries, including hydrogen production, ammonia production, and nat-
ural gas processing, already have CC technology built into their
purification steps in the form of amine absorption. These three
industries and ethanol production form the high-purity set of indus-
tries, or industries that produce CO2 streams pure enough that no

Padditional CO2 separation is required. Existing CC paves the way for
easily completing a CCS retrofit by only adding processing units such
as dehydration and compression.

PTable 9 summarizes several salient features for choosing a path-
way forward for implementing CC. For instance, industries where
process CO2 and combustion CO2 are combined could indicate an
increased complexity in designing a capture system if only process
CO2 is targeted. However, if the industry accounts for a large portion
of process emissions across many industries, prioritizing it for car-
bon capture could produce a greater mitigation impact than other
industries. Considering these factors, a possible implementation
pathway would focus on ethanol production facilities first, as they
produce high purity streams which make up 65% of on-site emis-
sions and account for sizable portion of total industrial process CO2
considered in this review. The cement industry would be the next
contender, given a large percentage of on-site emissions emanate
from the cement kiln, and cement accounts for almost a quarter of
total industrial process CO2.

PThe ammonia industry would make an attractive third choice,
due to its high purity stream of CO2 that accounts for 63% of on-site
CO2 emissions. Hydrogen production could be considered next, as it
produces a relatively high purity CO2 stream which accounts for a
majority of on-site emissions. Iron and steel manufacturing produces
several low to moderately concentrated CO2 streams, and the blast
furnace produces a mixed process and combustion stream of CO2.
The division between process and combustion within the blast fur-
nace is a complicated one. The combustion of coke produces CO,
which then reduces iron ore and creates CO2. Extricating process
CO2 from combustion CO2 is therefore a tricky task, and may further
complicate the capture process if a redesign if desired. These factors
push iron and steel manufacturing further down the CC pathway.

PNatural gas processing and ethylene oxide, while they produce
high purity streams, only account for relatively small portions of
industrial process CO2. On the other hand, petroleum refineries
account for almost a fifth of industrial process CO2, but are com-
prised of numerous lower purity CO2 streams. These qualities make
these three industries less attractive for initial CC implementation,
and better suited for consideration towards the end of the industrial
CC pathway. Finally, ethylene production emits relatively small
amounts of dilute CO2, making it the last industry to be considered
on the CC pathway.

PIt is also important to consider the largest single emitters of CO2:
power plants. Fossil-fuel power plants are unlikely to disappear on a
time scale necessary to mitigate climate change. CCS provides a
pathway for fossil-fueled power plants to act as a bridge between
today and a low-carbon, renewable energy future. Though power
plant flue gas is relatively dilute in CO2 and therefore expensive to
separate, capture costs may be reduced by using the knowledge
gained from first implementing the technology on industrial sour-
ces.

PThe picture of CCS potential within the U.S. is completed by tak-
ing facility-level data and combining it with geographic CO2 point
source data. Emerging trends create a deeper understanding of
nationwide emissions, and allow areas of lowest capture cost to be
identified. Overall, Texas emits the most CO2 from both electricity
generation and industrial processes. In addition to Texas, Louisiana
and the Midwest emit the most process CO2, while the eastern Mid-
west (stretching from Missouri to Pennsylvania) and Florida emit
the most electricity generation CO2. Capturing all of the capture-rel-
evant process CO2 could cost between $6.17 and $11.13 billion U.S.
per year, and would offset roughly 5% of total 2014 U.S. CO2 emis-
sions. Capturing all capture-relevant CO2 (from both process and

b All industries can count process heating as a low purity stream.
c When process and combustion CO2 are emitted from the same stack, the U.S. Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program counts all of the CO2 as process CO2, which may lead to some artificially higher aver-
age percentage of CO2 considered Process. This is especially true for cement production and iron and steel production, as process and combustion CO2 are created from within the same chamber for cer-
tain process units. Hydrogen production's high percentage of CO2 considered process is likely due to PSA tail gas being combusted for heat in combination with other fuels.

d Facility averages across each industry.
e The vast majority of facilities that containted more than one industry were petroleum refineries pair with either hydrogen production or ethylene production. As combustion emissions are reported
in aggregate for each facility, the following method was used to assign combustion CO2 emissions to each industry: the average percentage of CO2 considered process was taken over all single-industry
hydrogen and ethylene production facilities, and used to allocate combustion CO2 to their industry. The remaining combustion CO2 was then allocated to the petroleum refining industry.

Pelectricity generation) could cost between $93.35 to $122.53 billion
U.S. per year, and could displace around 41% of CO2 emissions.

PThe minimum work of separation and Sherwood cost analysis
show that as the CO2 purity in a capture stream increases, the work
and capture cost on a molar basis decrease. This is critical to finding
the lowest cost opportunities for CCS pilot plant deployment. The
GIS analysis also shows that higher-purity point sources also tend to
emit less CO2 than dilute sources. By combining capture cost data
with the geographical locations of different industrial point sources,
the “low-hanging fruit” of CCS have been located in the Midwest and
along the Gulf Coast. These regions have many high-purity CO2
industries, such as ethanol production, natural gas processing,
ammonia production and hydrogen production. The southern Mid-
west and Gulf Coast are also co-located with potential geological
sequestration sites, another important piece to the CCS puzzle.
Therefore, southern Midwest and Gulf Coast are the regions in the
United States that should be targeted for implementing CCS pilot
plants and demonstration projects.
