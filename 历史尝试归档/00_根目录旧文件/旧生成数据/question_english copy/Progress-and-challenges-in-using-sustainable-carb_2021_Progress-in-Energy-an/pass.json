    "question_text": "Calculate the theoretical gravimetric capacity difference between sodium and lithium ions in batteries, considering their atomic properties and standard reduction potentials, and explain how this affects battery energy density.",
    "standard_answer": "The theoretical gravimetric capacity can be calculated using Faraday's law: Capacity = (nF)/(3.6M), where n is electrons transferred (1 for both Li and Na), F is Faraday's constant (96485 C/mol), and M is atomic mass. For lithium (M=6.94 g/mol): Capacity = (1×96485)/(3.6×6.94) = 3860 mAh/g. For sodium (M=22.99 g/mol): Capacity = (1×96485)/(3.6×22.99) = 1165 mAh/g. This represents a 69.8% reduction in theoretical capacity for sodium compared to lithium. Additionally, sodium has a higher standard reduction potential (-2.71 V vs SHE) compared to lithium (-3.04 V), resulting in a 0.33 V lower cell voltage. The combined effect of lower capacity and lower voltage significantly reduces the theoretical energy density (Wh/kg) of sodium-ion batteries. For a typical full cell configuration, this translates to approximately 60-70% lower energy density for sodium systems compared to lithium, making sodium-ion batteries less suitable for applications requiring high energy density despite sodium's natural abundance and cost advantages.",
    "original_text": {
      "1": "However, Na introduces some limitations because of its: 1) greater molecular weight and ionic radius than Li, 2) weaker binding to graphite as compared with Li, 3) higher standard reduction potential (-2.71 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode (SHE)), as compared with ~ -3.04 V for Li, and 4) lower gravimetric capacity (1165 mAh/g as compared with 3829 mAh/g for Li).",
      "2": "K also has some limitations that hinder its effective use in a technically relevant application. These include: i) poor ion diffusivity in the solid electrode, ii) large graphite volume change during cycling (~ 61%), iii) severe consumption of electrolyte given the low electrochemical potential of K+/K in propylene carbonate, iv) persistent tendency to deposit in dendritic form, and v) limited energy and power density because of its high atomic mass."

    "question_text": "How do the different decomposition behaviors of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin during pyrolysis affect the porosity development and final carbon structure in biomass-derived anodes?",
    "standard_answer": "The three main biomass components exhibit distinct pyrolysis behaviors that significantly influence final carbon structure. Cellulose decomposes between 200-400°C with high oxygen content leading to extensive evolution of H2O, CO2, and CO, creating abundant micropores through volatile release. Its crystalline nature and high polymeric degree facilitate formation of well-defined porous structures. Hemicellulose decomposes at 200-320°C, being amorphous and highly branched, it contributes to mesopore formation but with less structural regularity. Lignin decomposes slowly over a broader temperature range (200-500°C) and, despite its lower oxygen content, its complex cross-linked aromatic structure resists pore formation and tends to produce nonporous carbon. The oxygen from functional groups in cellulose and hemicellulose transforms into gases more readily, enabling easier activation and micropore generation. In contrast, lignin's aromatic subunits and short-range ordering lead to denser carbon structures with limited porosity. The relative proportions of these components in biomass determine the final pore architecture, with cellulose-rich materials typically yielding higher specific surface areas and better-developed pore networks suitable for ion storage in battery applications.",

      "1": "During pyrolysis, oxygen from the functional groups in cellulosic and hemicellulosic biomass transforms easily into H2O, CO and CO2 and enables an easier activation and generation of micropores. By contrast, the aromatic subunits in lignin conduct to form nonporous carbon despite the presence of oxygen-containing groups, because these are less effective in pore creation.",
      "2": "The thermal decomposition of lignin is slower over a broader temperature range (200-500°C) than that of cellulose and hemicellulose. Cellulose decomposes between 200-400°C, whereas hemicellulose decomposes in the 200-320°C range."

    "question_text": "How do the structural characteristics of hard carbon, specifically the presence of hydrogen and single graphene sheets, enhance lithium storage capacity compared to graphite, and what are the fundamental mechanisms behind this improvement?",
    "standard_answer": "Hard carbon exhibits superior lithium storage capacity compared to graphite due to its distinct structural features. Graphite has a theoretical capacity of 372 mAh/g, which is limited because nearest-neighbor sites cannot be occupied by Li ions due to Coulomb repulsion being larger than the binding energy of Li to graphite. In contrast, hard carbons show better electrochemical performance because of their relatively good cyclability, tailorable morphology based on organic precursors and processing temperature, and their ability to accommodate a much higher amount of Li than graphite. This enhanced capacity is attributed to the presence of hydrogen (H) and a large fraction of single graphene sheets, which allow the adsorption of a large amount of Li on both sides of the single-layer sheets. The disordered structure and cross-linked graphene sheets in hard carbon create additional storage sites that facilitate lithium adsorption beyond the intercalation limits of graphite, leading to capacities that exceed graphite's theoretical maximum.",

    "question_text": "Explain how pyrolysis temperature affects the structural evolution of biomass-derived carbon during carbonization, focusing on the stacking arrangements of graphene sheets and the relationship between temperature and crystallite growth patterns, as described in the provided paper.",
    "standard_answer": "Pyrolysis temperature significantly influences the structural evolution of biomass-derived carbon through thermal reorganization processes. At lower temperatures around 700°C, the poor stacking of C-C aromatic structures leads to the formation of micropores due to irregular arrangements. As temperature increases to the 600-1200°C range, hydrogen atoms are removed and the structural organization becomes more defined. Based on the nature of the carbon resource, the wrinkled graphite sheets stack either in a near-parallel fashion in regions called 'organized carbon' or arrange in a geometry resembling a 'house of cards'. The crystallite growth shows distinct temperature-dependent behavior where increasing carbonization temperature promotes more horizontal growth of pseudographitic structures rather than vertical growth. Consequently, at higher temperatures, the La value (basal-plane correlation length) becomes higher than the Lc value (c-axis correlation length), indicating preferential lateral expansion of graphitic domains over vertical stacking. This temperature-dependent structural evolution creates the characteristic microporous architecture of biomass-derived carbons with irregular cross-linked graphene sheets forming the interstices that define the pore structure.",

      "1": "At this low temperature range (~700°C), the poor stacking of C-C aromatic structures can lead to the formation of micropores.
