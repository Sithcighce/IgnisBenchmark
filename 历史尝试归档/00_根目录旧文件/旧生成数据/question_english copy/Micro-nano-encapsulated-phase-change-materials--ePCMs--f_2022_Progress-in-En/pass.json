    "question_text": "What are the fundamental physical mechanisms behind supercooling in PCMs, and how does the critical radius of solid nuclei R_cr influence the degree of supercooling according to the mathematical relationship T_sc = (4/3)(γ_o T_m)/(ρ_s H_s-l R_cr)?",
    "standard_answer": "Supercooling occurs due to nucleation barriers where PCMs remain liquid below their equilibrium freezing temperature. The physical mechanisms involve: (1) Surface energy effects where the interface energy γ_o between solid nuclei and liquid creates an energy barrier that must be overcome for nucleation; (2) The critical radius R_cr represents the minimum stable nucleus size, below which surface tension forces dominate and cause dissolution; (3) The enthalpy of fusion H_s-l provides the driving force for phase transition, with larger values requiring more significant undercooling to initiate nucleation; (4) Density differences between solid and liquid phases affect the volumetric work required for nucleus formation. The mathematical relationship shows that supercooling degree T_sc increases with higher surface energy γ_o and melting temperature T_m, but decreases with larger R_cr, higher solid density ρ_s, and greater latent heat H_s-l. Smaller capsule sizes in micro/nano-encapsulation reduce the probability of containing nucleation sites, thereby increasing supercooling as each capsule has insufficient impurities to initiate heterogeneous nucleation.",

      "2": "The degree of supercooling is definitely increased if the bulk volume is divided into microscopic particles through encapsulation or an emulsion process, because each capsule will have an insufficient number of impurities"

Compare this to a sensible TES system using water (c_p = 4.18 kJ/kg·K) storing the same amount of energy over the same temperature range.",
    "standard_answer": "For the latent TES system: Q_latent = M[∫_T_i^T_m c_p,s dT + H_s-l + ∫_T_m^T_f c_p,l dT] = 50[∫_15^28 2.5 dT + 160 + ∫_28^45 3.0 dT] = 50[2.5×(28-15) + 160 + 3.0×(45-28)] = 50[32.5 + 160 + 51] = 50 × 243.5 = 12,175 kJ. For the sensible water system storing equivalent energy: Q_sensible = M_water c_p,water ΔT = M_water × 4.18 × (45-15) = M_water × 125.4 kJ. Setting equal to 12,175 kJ gives M_water = 12,175/125.4 ≈ 97.1 kg. The latent system stores the same energy with approximately 48.5% less mass than the sensible system, demonstrating the superior energy density of PCM-based storage. This calculation highlights the dual functionality of latent TES, combining sensible heating in both solid and liquid phases with the high-energy-density phase transition process.",

    "standard_answer": "The paper identifies four hierarchically distinct regions during PCM melting: (1) pure conduction, (2) mixed conduction and natural convection, (3) dominant natural convection, and (4) shrinking solid. In the pure conduction region, heat transfer occurs primarily through conduction during the early stages of melting. As melting progresses, the mixed conduction and natural convection region emerges where both conduction and convection mechanisms are active. The paper specifically notes that 'conduction can be used to transfer heat during the early stages of melting and solidification, while convection currents dominate in the mushy zone.' This suggests that conduction is the dominant mechanism initially, but as the liquid phase develops and natural convection currents form, convection becomes increasingly important. The transition from conduction-dominated to convection-dominated heat transfer represents a fundamental aspect of PCM melting behavior that affects the overall melting rate and thermal performance of the system.",

    "standard_answer": "The Stefan condition provides the mathematical framework for tracking the moving solid-liquid interface during PCM phase transitions by balancing the latent heat absorption/release with the conductive heat fluxes from both phases. The equation H_s-lρ(ds(t)/dt) = k_s(δT_s/δx) - k_l(δT_l/δx) describes how the interface velocity ds/dt depends on the latent heat of fusion H_s-l, density ρ, and the thermal conductivity gradients across the interface. This formulation accounts for the energy required for phase transition, where the latent heat term represents the energy barrier for phase change. The condition captures conductive heat transfer mechanisms in both solid and liquid phases, with k_s and k_l governing heat diffusion rates. The time-dependent nature of phase front propagation makes this a nonlinear moving boundary problem, requiring numerical simulation using computational packages within specific temperature ranges due to the unknown position and velocity of the boundary in advance.",
