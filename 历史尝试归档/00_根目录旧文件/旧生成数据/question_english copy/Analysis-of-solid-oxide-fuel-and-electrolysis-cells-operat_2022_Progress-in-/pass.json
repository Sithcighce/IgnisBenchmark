    "question_text": "Quantitatively, how does the equilibrium carbon activity for methane cracking and the Boudouard reaction vary with temperature, and what implications does this have for selecting SOFC operating conditions with carbon-containing fuels?",
    "standard_answer": "The equilibrium carbon activity for methane cracking (CH4 → C + 2H2) and the Boudouard reaction (2CO → C + CO2) exhibits opposing temperature dependencies due to their thermodynamic properties. Methane cracking is endothermic (ΔH > 0), so its equilibrium constant increases with temperature according to the van't Hoff equation. Thus, carbon formation from CH4 is favored at higher temperatures (e.g., >700°C), where the reaction becomes spontaneous. Conversely, the Boudouard reaction is exothermic (ΔH < 0), leading to a higher equilibrium constant at lower temperatures (500–700°C). For example, at 600°C, the Boudouard reaction can produce significant carbon from CO, while at 800°C, methane cracking dominates. This has critical implications for SOFC operation: with high-CO fuels (e.g., syngas), lower operating temperatures (<700°C) risk carbon deposition via Boudouard, necessitating high steam or CO2 concentrations to gasify carbon. With high-CH4 fuels (e.g., natural gas), higher temperatures (>750°C) increase carbon risk from cracking, requiring optimized steam-to-carbon ratios (S/C > 2) to suppress carbon through reforming reactions. Operating outside these thermodynamic windows, or using equilibrium calculations, helps prevent carbon deposition and ensures stable performance.",
    "original_text": {
      "1": "If the operating temperature is increased, a higher amount of carbon is expected to occur due to methane cracking, while amount of carbon formed due to Boudouard reaction is higher at lower operating temperatures.",
      "2": "Such equilibrium calculations are also used as simple prediction tools, which enable the user to adjust the operating conditions to prevent the undesired degradation effects."

    "standard_answer": "Phosphine (PH3) and chlorine contaminants interact with nickel-based electrodes in solid oxide cells through distinct chemical pathways that cause irreversible degradation. Phosphine exposure results in the formation of new phases, mainly nickel phosphides, but also nickel phosphates, which is identified as an irreversible change and negatively affects the overall performance. These nickel phosphide phases permanently deactivate catalytic sites and alter electrode morphology. For chlorine contaminants, the degradation occurs in two stages: the first stage is identified as reversible adsorption and blocking of the nickel catalyst surface, while the second stage is observed to be irreversible degradation and formation of nickel chloride compounds on the surface. The formation of nickel chloride compounds represents an irreversible morphological change that damages the fuel electrode structure. Both contaminants lead to performance deterioration through chemical interactions that modify the electrode composition and microstructure, with phosphine forming stable nickel phosphide phases and chlorine progressing from reversible adsorption to irreversible nickel chloride formation.",

    "standard_answer": "Carbon deposition on Ni/YSZ electrodes occurs through different mechanisms depending on the fuel composition. When operating with carbon monoxide (CO), carbon forms primarily through the Boudouard reaction (2CO → C + CO2) and covers solely the nickel catalytic sites. The carbon appears as a solid layer that encapsulates the Ni grains without extending to the YSZ surface. In contrast, methane (CH4) leads to carbon formation that covers both nickel and YSZ surfaces, appearing in the form of amorphous carbon. The key distinction lies in the coverage pattern: CO-derived carbon is restricted to Ni sites, while CH4-derived carbon affects both electrode components. This difference in carbon morphology and distribution directly impacts electrode degradation, with methane causing more extensive coverage that can block active sites on both catalytic and ionic conducting phases.",

    "question_text": "Based on the provided research, how does the reversibility of sulfur poisoning in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) depend on operating temperature, and what specific temperature thresholds determine whether the degradation is reversible or irreversible?",
    "standard_answer": "The reversibility of sulfur poisoning in SOFCs is critically dependent on operating temperature, with distinct temperature thresholds determining whether the degradation process is reversible or irreversible. According to the research, sulfur poisoning exhibits reversible behavior at higher operating temperatures around 800°C, where performance deterioration can be recovered by removing sulfurous species from the fuel stream. This reversibility was demonstrated in studies using synthetic product gas from wood steam gasification containing 1-10 ppm H2S, where performance regeneration was achieved after sulfur removal. In contrast, operation at lower temperatures such as 700°C results in irreversible degradation that cannot be recovered. The temperature dependence of sulfur poisoning reversibility has been confirmed across different SOFC configurations, including both fuel electrode-supported and electrolyte-supported cells, indicating this is a fundamental thermal effect. The specific temperature threshold between reversible and irreversible behavior appears to lie between 700°C and 800°C, with the higher temperature facilitating regeneration while lower temperatures lead to permanent performance loss.",

    "standard_answer": "Nickel reoxidation in solid oxide cells occurs through two primary mechanisms: redox cycling processes involving repeated reduction and oxidation of the fuel electrode, and exposure to excessive oxidizing species (steam or air) that reach the fuel electrode due to leakage or specific operating conditions. In SOFC mode, high fuel utilization increases steam concentration at the fuel electrode, accelerating reoxidation. In SOE mode, low steam utilization with high steam concentrations creates conditions favorable for reoxidation. The influence of current density differs between operating modes: in SOFC mode, increasing current density increases steam concentration, which accelerates Ni reoxidation. Conversely, in SOE mode, high operating current densities enable conversion of steam into hydrogen, thereby reducing the amount of available steam and decreasing the propensity towards Ni reoxidation. Steam concentration directly affects reoxidation risk in both modes, with higher steam concentrations increasing oxidation potential. The specific operating conditions and electrode microstructure determine the extent of oxidation damage.",
    "original_text": {
      "1": "The phenomenon of Ni reoxidation can occur due to (i) redox processes that present a circle of reduction and oxidation processes of the fuel electrode or, (ii) an excessive number of oxidizing species on the fuel electrode (steam or air) that can diffuse to the electrode due to leakage, or be caused by high fuel utilization during SOFC operation and/or low steam utilization during SOE operation.",
      "2": "In conclusion, steam amount and operating current density present a decisive factor regarding Ni reoxidation process. Taking into consideration the SOFC operating mode, increasing the operating current increases the steam concentration, which, in turn, can accelerate Ni reoxidation."
