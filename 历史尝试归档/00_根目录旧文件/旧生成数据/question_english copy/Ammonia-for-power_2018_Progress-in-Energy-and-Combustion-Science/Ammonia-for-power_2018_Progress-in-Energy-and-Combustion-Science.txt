A potential enabler of a low carbon economy is the energy vector hydrogen. However, issues associated
with hydrogen storage and distribution are currently a barrier for its implementation. Hence, other indi-
rect storage media such as ammonia and methanol are currently being considered. Of these, ammonia is
a carbon free carrier which offers high energy density; higher than compressed air. Hence, it is proposed
that ammonia, with its established transportation network and high flexibility, could provide a practical
next generation system for energy transportation, storage and use for power generation. Therefore, this
review highlights previous influential studies and ongoing research to use this chemical as a viable en-
ergy vector for power applications, emphasizing the challenges that each of the reviewed technologies
faces before implementation and commercial deployment is achieved at a larger scale. The review covers
technologies such as ammonia in cycles either for power or CO 2 removal, fuel cells, reciprocating en-
gines, gas turbines and propulsion technologies, with emphasis on the challenges of using the molecule
and current understanding of the fundamental combustion patterns of ammonia blends.

1. Introduction

Renewable energy is playing an increasingly important role in
addressing some of the key challenges facing today’s global soci-
ety, such as the cost of energy, energy security and climate change.
The  exploitation  of  renewable  energy  looks  set  only  to  increase
across the world as nations seek to meet their legislative and en-
vironmental obligations with respect to greenhouse gas emissions.
There is broad agreement that energy storage is crucial for over-
coming the inherent intermittency of renewable resources and in-
creasing their share of generation capacity.

Thus, future energy systems require effective, affordable meth-
ods for energy storage. To date, a number of mechanical, electrical,
thermal, and chemical approaches have been developed for storing
electrical energy for utility-scale services. Storage solutions such as
lithium batteries or redox cells [1–3] are unlikely to be able to pro-
vide the required capacity for grid-scale energy storage. Pumped
hydro  and  methods  such  as  compressed  gas  energy  storage  suf-
fer from geological constraints to their deployment [4–6] . The only
sufficiently flexible mechanism allowing large quantities of energy
to be stored over long time periods at any location is chemical en-
ergy storage [7] .

Chemical  storage  of  energy  can  be  considered  via  hydrogen
or carbon-neutral hydrogen derivatives. One such example is am-
monia,  which  has  been  identified  as  a  sustainable  fuel  for  mo-
bile and remote applications. Similar to synthesised hydrogen, am-
monia  is  a  product  that  can  be  obtained  either  from  fossil  fu-
els, biomass or  other renewable sources  such as wind and pho-
tovoltaics, where excessive electrical supply can be converted into
some non-electrical form of energy [1] . Some advantages of ammo-
nia over hydrogen are its lower cost per unit of stored energy, i.e.
over 182 days ammonia storage would cost 0.54 $/kg-H
2 compared
to 14.95 $/kg-H
2  of pure hydrogen storage [8] , higher volumetric
energy density (7.1–2.9 MJ/L), easier and more widespread produc-
tion, handling and distribution capacity, and better commercial vi-
ability. Ammonia produced by harvesting of renewable sources has
the following properties [9–11] ,

1. It is itself carbon-free, has no direct greenhouse gas effect, and
can be synthesized with an entirely carbon-free process from
renewable power sources;

2. It has an energy density of 22.5 MJ/kg, comparable to that of
fossil fuels (low-ranked coals have around 20 MJ/kg; natural gas
has around 55 MJ/kg, LNG 54 MJ/kg, and hydrogen 142 MJ/kg);

3. It can easily be rendered liquid by compression to 0.8 MPa at

atmospheric temperature; and,

4. An  established,  reliable  infrastructure  already  exists  for  both
ammonia storage and distribution (including pipeline, rail, road,
3 are produced and
ship); today around 180 million tons of NH
transported annually.

1.1. Interest in ammonia for power

Ammonia has recently started to receive attention internation-
ally as a consequence of the primary benefits outlined in the pre-
vious section. For example, Japan has been looking for renewable
alternatives  for  their  energy  consumption  requirements  over  the
last few decades, due to lack of natural energy resource. Hydro-
gen has been presented as an attractive solution that could meet
their  energy  demands,  accompanied  by  reduction  in  greenhouse
gas emissions. However, Japan has clearly recognised the potential
of ammonia to serve as the hydrogen carrying energy vector, and a
22-member consortium led by Tokyo Gas has been created to cu-
rate “Green Ammonia” promoted by the Cross-Ministerial Strategic
Innovation Program (SIP) of Japan [12] , seeking to demonstrate hy-
drogen, ammonia and hydrides as building blocks of a hydrogen
economy, Fig. 1 . The Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST)
has announced the intentions of the consortium to develop a strat-
egy for “forming an ammonia value chain” that promotes the lead-
ership of the country in the production and use of the chemical
worldwide. All consortium members have extensive knowledge of
handling ammonia, with multimillion projects in progress or un-
der consideration. For example, IHI Corporation and Tohoku Uni-
versity plan to invest $8.8 M in 2017 to set up a duel-fuel gas tur-
bine that co-fires one part of ammonia to five parts of methane
[13] ; similarly, Chugoku Electric Power Company intends to con-
duct co-firing experiments with coal and ammonia (at 0.6%) at one
of their power plants, paying $373,0 0 0 for the implementation of
this project [14] .

In  the  USA,  the  Advanced  Research  Project  Agency-Energy
(ARPA-E),  subsidiary  of  the  Department  of  Energy,  has  recently
launched  its  “Renewable  Energy  to  Fuels  through  Utilisation  of
Energy-Dense Liquids” (REFUEL) program, whose aim is to develop
scalable technologies for converting electrical energy from renew-
able sources into energy-dense carbon-neutral liquid fuels (CNLFs)
and back into electricity or hydrogen on demand, thereby acceler-
ating the shift to domestically produced transportation fuels, im-

proving American economic and energy security, and reducing en-
ergy emissions [16] .

ARPA-E  announced  that  grants  totalling  $32.7 M  would  be
awarded to 16 REFUEL projects of which 13 are focusing on ammo-
nia. From small scale ammonia synthesis using stranded wind en-
ergy to improving the Haber–Bosch process, recognised academic
institutions and large industrial enterprises are directly involved in
this program [17] . Thus, commitment from the US Department of
Energy to use ammonia as an energy vector and its further imple-
mentation in fuelling technologies to convert it back into hydro-
gen or energy are materialising through programs such as these.
Significant  work  on  the  use  of  ammonia  for  future  energy  sys-
tems  has  been  undertaken  by  other  US  institutions  such  as  the
Iowa State University and the University of Minnesota. The Univer-
sity of Minnesota [18] has pursued new methods for distributed
ammonia synthesis whereby small plants are able to produce hy-
drogen from wind to manufacture ammonia for fertilizing applica-
tions and fuelling of internal combustion engines. The latter will
run on a mixture of up to 50% ammonia with thermal reformers
to improve combustion efficiency through partial decomposition of
the molecule. This work is supported by recent analyses [19] that
show the implementation of ammonia to US fuel light-duty vehi-
cles (LDV) could potentially mitigate up to 30% of the cumulative
2 produced by LDV, eliminating up to 96% of carbon emissions
CO
from the sector by 2040 (718 Mt
CO2 per year). Furthermore, these
programs intend not only to develop new technologies but also for-
mulate public policies that motivated governmental agencies could
employ to encourage development and employment of such sys-
tems [18] .

The  UK  has  also  shown  strong  interest  in  the  use  of  ammo-
nia as a chemical energy store. Works performed by Cardiff Uni-
versity, Siemens, Oxford University and UK Science and Technol-
ogy  Funding  Council  are  underway  to  design  and  commission  a
first “Green Ammonia Decoupled” device that will show how en-
ergy from wind can be converted to ammonia for its storage and
further release of energy via an internal combustion engine [20] .
Similarly, Oxford University recently published an extended report
entitled “Analysis of Islanded Ammonia-Based Energy Storage Sys-

tems” [21] . The work assessed different technologies available in
the market and the potential economic implications of recovering
stranded, renewable energy in various sites, i.e. islanded and non-
islanded, through use of ammonia. The results demonstrated that
ammonia is economically viable for islanded regions where both
ammonia for energy storage and fertilizer are combined, Fig. 2 . Al-
though the current market is small and further development on
the  synthesis  of  carbon-free  ammonia  is  needed  for  further  ex-
pansion, the proposal shows that under the current scenario the
use of ammonia for these means is feasible. Special emphasis on
this  point  needs  to  be  given  to  those  small  islands  around  the
UK  or  other  islanded  nations  where  such  systems  can  success-
fully  and  economically  be  deployed.  Politics  have  also  a  role  to
play in the use of ammonia, which has found support from Parlia-
ment in the form of Lord Howell of Guilford, who recently wrote
in  ‘Jpn  Times’  that  ammonia  will  be  a  “revolutionary  disruption
coming  to  the  energy  sector,” and  suggests  that  using  ammonia
for energy storage will prove to be “a game-changer at least on
the scale of the shale oil and gas revolution.” Lord Howell of Guil-
ford served as Secretary of State for Energy and for Transport dur-
ing  his  thirty  years  as  a  British  Member  of  Parliament,  and  he
is  now  chairman  of  the  House  of  Lords  International  Relations
Committee [22] .

In Australia a new chapter of the NH

3 fuel association has been
recently opened, with industrial support from companies produc-
ing ammonia and hydrogen, hosted by Monash University. Repre-
sentatives of the NH
3 chapter have discussed the interest that am-
monia has spurred over the last year after a large conference in the
US, emphasizing the need to start working closely with the hydro-
gen fuel community. The Australian chapter hopes to attract indi-
viduals and industries from Singapore, Malaysia and New Zealand
to increase awareness of the chemical, boosting the profile of the
use of ammonia for energy storage and power generation [23] . The
promotion of these works has led to one of the biggest projects
for the production of green ammonia from solar energy. Yara, the
second biggest ammonia producer, has announced its intentions to
build a demonstration plant that will produce ammonia from so-
lar energy in Pilbara, Western Australia. Hydrogen, product of the

electrolysis of water powered by solar energy, will be used for the
Haber–Bosch  process  in  these  facilities.  Although  this  is  not  the
first  project  that  uses  solar  energy  to  produce  ammonia,  this  is
by far the biggest company to commission such a system to date.
The company believes that if the program is successful, “it could
grow to a full replacement of our current natural gas consumption
by producing hydrogen with a solar field. In the long-term future
you could think about making it so big that it could be a multi-
ple of the current ammonia production. And then you could think
about integration of ammonia into the world market, but also in
the world market of renewable fuel production” [24] .

Among  all  mainland  European  nations,  the  Netherlands  are
leading the promotion of ammonia. The rationale for this fact is
that the Netherlands possess a substantial quantity of renewable
resources as a consequence of the high investment from govern-
ment and industry. Therefore, ammonia appears as an energy car-
rier that has the potential to provide the country with enough en-
ergy for its current demand, whilst allowing producing companies
to export any excess power. Companies including NUON, Gasunie,
Statoil and OCI Nitrogen are assessing the conversion of one of the
Magnum Power plant’s three 440 MW gasifiers with the intention
of using hydrogen, and eventually ammonia, in super batteries that
will feed the station by 2023–2030 [25] . Simultaneously, produc-
ers, distributors and naval designers seek the progression of the
technology in terms of storage in large ship containers that cannot
only mobilise ammonia but also can use it for fuelling purposes. C-
Job Naval and Proton Venture are part of a consortium that seeks
funding opportunities to develop a new generation of super vessels
capable to run on ammonia by 2040 [26] .

Finally, and with a global interest in the use of ammonia for
power, the International Energy Agency (IEA) has recently become
a promoter of ammonia for a carbon-free future. The Renewable

Energy Division [27] has recognised that ammonia can be used to
tap into stranded energy produced from renewable sources (wind,
solar, tidal, etc.), and then be used to redistribute hydrogen prod-
uct from electrolysers connected to these systems. As evidenced in
their study, ammonia is much less costly to store for a long time
compared to hydrogen, i.e. 0.5 $/kg-H
2 for ammonia compared to
15 $/kg-H
2 for hydrogen over half a year, and at least three times
less  costly  to  ship  on  sea  or  land  [28] .  However,  the  concept  is
not directly competing with hydrogen, only with its mobility and
storage. Cedric Philibert, Senior Energy Analyst at the IEA, reflects
that the production of hydrogen from renewables dates from the
1960s, but it is only recently that the increasingly lower cost of re-
newables starts making these technologies competitive for produc-
tion of the chemical, thus conversion into ammonia for distribution
seems the most economically competitive alternative.

In  this  year’s  edition  of  the  Energy  Technology  Perspectives
2017 - Catalysing Energy Technology Transformations [29] , for the
first  time  the  EIA  has  featured  ammonia  in  two  major  technol-
ogy transformations. First, ammonia production is shown making
a transition away from fossil fuel feedstocks and towards electri-
fication, using hydrogen derived from electrolyzers. Secondly, fol-
lowing this assumption that sustainable ammonia will be widely
available in the future, the IEA also classifies ammonia as an en-
ergy carrier, in the category of future electricity-based fuels (PtX
synthetic fuels). The inclusion of this pair of technology transfor-
mations  represents  a  major  step  towards  broader  acceptance  of
ammonia as an energy vector, from the perspectives of both tech-
nical feasibility and policy imperative.

Therefore,  countries  and  international  agencies  have  started
raising the awareness of the potential of ammonia for storage of
hydrogen, a rationale that has served to boost research in the area
of its use as energy vector and potential fuel.

A viable energy system based on ammonia faces four primary

barriers:

1. Carbon-free synthesis of ammonia,
2. Power generation from small to utility-scale size,
3. Public  acceptance  through  safe  regulations  and  appropriate

community engagement,

4. Economic  viability  for  integration  of  technologies  and  green

production of ammonia.

Current  ammonia  production  methods  are  heavily  reliant  on
fossil fuels and consequently, barrier ( 1 ) is a challenging area that
still requires exhaustive research and will be treated as a separate
topic. Barrier ( 2 ) above is also critical, since most developments to
date have focused on improving small- to medium-scale devices
such as reciprocating engines. However, power output from such
units  using  ammonia  is  relatively  modest,  typically  in  the  range
of 0.1–1.0 MW. Here, one of the main challenges is the reduction
of NOx emissions and unburned ammonia, contaminants that di-
rectly impact on climate change and are toxic to life, respectively.

ratory diseases, with an estimate of 23,500 premature deaths per
year only in the UK alone [30] . Although considerable research has
been conducted understanding the formation process of this pol-
lutant [31] , its formation and consumption during combustion and
post-combustion processes using ammonia are still at the core of
the research agendas of various research groups. Similarly, toxic-
ity of ammonia is one of the major impediments to deploy these
technologies, as public perception is very formative and perception
on the nuisance of its smell even at low concentrations is a critical
barrier ( 3 ) that requires further studies, understanding and innova-
tion. Thus, barrier ( 3 ) has played an important role even in small
devices, restricting the deployment of reciprocating engines, i.e. in
transport or small scale energy production. Therefore, any poten-
tial system based on ammonia needs to undergo health and safety
impact analyses and a review of current legislations, as well as tak-
ing into account public and end-user perceptions and tolerability.
Finally, the Economic viability (barrier 4) of such systems needs
to be proved, encouraging investors to set the foundations of both
industries and suppliers capable of delivering equipment and inte-
grated systems that produce green ammonia for its use in power
generation.

1.3. Significance of ammonia for power generation

A  key  step  in  the  realisation  of  ammonia  as  a  viable  energy
vector is releasing the stored energy at the power levels required
for commercial or grid-scale applications. Existing fuel cells, cycles,
reciprocating engines and gas-turbine technologies and the under-
pinning science have been developed for use with hydrocarbons
or other fuel sources. Thus, the development of new devices and
techniques that can utilise green ammonia would have the follow-
ing advantages:

1. Reducing emissions. Being carbon free, ammonia offers the pos-
sibility of fuelling gas turbines, fuel cells and reciprocating en-
gines without direct CO
2 emissions. If the energy (and raw ma-
terials) used to synthesise the ammonia come from renewable
sources, the entire cycle can be made completely carbon-free.
Although the transition from current fuel sources to ammonia
will still produce carbon, a dual-fuel exchange strategy that in-
cludes carbon sources (i.e. methane, methanol) can potentially
lead  to  an  order-of-magnitude  reduction  of  carbon  emissions
in the near term [32] , ultimately leading to zero-carbon energy
systems.

2. Improving security of supply . Ammonia can be synthesised from
abundant raw materials, namely hydrogen (in water) and nitro-
gen (in air). Ammonia is already produced and transported in
considerable volumes ( ∼180 Mtonnes/year [27] ), and is there-
fore a practical and scalable fuel. With the capability of provid-
ing grid-scale energy storage, ammonia facilitates the increasing
exploitation of renewable energy sources.

3. Reducing  costs  of  energy .  Large  (grid)  scale  energy  arbitrage
can  only  be  practically  achieved  by  pumped  hydro  (in  suit-
able  dams/aquifers),  compressed  air  energy  storage  (in  suit-
able undergrounds cavities), and chemical energy storage (in-
cluding ammonia). The capital costs of ammonia energy stor-
age are comparable to or better than those for compressed air
and pumped hydro but without the attendant geological con-
straints, and substantially lower than other challenger technolo-
gies such as electric batteries [33] . Considerable infrastructure
already exists for the transportation and storage of ammonia,
along with well-established safe handling procedures, and this
reduces the need for investment in further infrastructure and
training [34,35] . Although the economic inertia of using fossil
fuels is entrenched globally, competitive scenarios can be cre-
ated by using such a fuel source that can be traded and moved
using existing infrastructure, build around liquid fuels [32] .

These aspects require careful consideration, thus recognising ur-
gent further research needs for the realisation of a carbon-free am-
monia economy via storage of renewable energy.

At  present, there is  a  range of  existing  mechanical, chemical,
thermal  and  electrical  technologies  for  storing  electrical  energy
adaptable from small to large scale applications, Fig. 3 . Of all these
technologies,  only  Compressed  Air  Energy  Storage  (CAES),  Pump
Hydro and Chemical Energy Storage systems have enough commer-
cial maturity and the ability to store energy for large scale applica-
tions over long periods of time. The first two suffer the limitation
of site placement due to their geographic/geological requirements.
Thus,  chemical  storage  via  hydrogen  and/or  derivatives  (such  as
ammonia) and hydrocarbons present a viable option for practical
energy storage in the near term. Bearing in mind a desire to re-
duce carbon emissions, then only hydrogen and ammonia remain
as candidates to drive the storage of large quantities of energy with
2 emissions.
flexible relocation of resources with a reduction on CO
Finally, movement and storage of hydrogen has proved to be more
complex than for ammonia, for which a fully developed infrastruc-
ture  has  existed  over  a  century,  thus  positioning  ammonia  as  a
strong candidate to support the concept of flexible energy storage
at the largest scale.

4 , 49%H

Regarding ammonia transition, ammonia can be used to sup-
port power and heating processing with other fuels, thus increas-
ing  its  flexibility  of  usage.  Ammonia  blends  have  been  assessed
and compared to conventional and higher hydrocarbon fuels, Fig.
4 . These blends were analysed in terms of their Wobbe Index and
volumetric High Heating Value [36] . As observed, the Wobbe in-
dexes of the ammonia blends fall very close to that of town gas
(i.e. 31%CH
2 ) and likely similarly to other syn-
gases. Hydrogen, with a higher Wobbe Index, is closer to ammonia
than hydrocarbon based fuels with a similar volumetric high heat-
ing value, thus rendering conversion equipment simpler. Also, it is
evident that the increase of hydrogen in the ammonia blends (from
0% to 75% in this comparative study [36] ) does not show a greater
increase  in Wobbe  Index,  a  point  to  be  considered  when  devel-
oping distribution and combustion systems for ammonia-hydrogen
blends, which on this basis could be well started from the prece-
dent of town gas systems.

Recent  Life  Cycle  Assessments  (LCA)  conducted  by  Bicer  and
Dincer [37] show how the use of ammonia for transportation and
power production can have considerable advantages for the miti-

troduction of ammonia is presented as a complementary enabler
of the hydrogen economy, rather than a contender. Hence, the aim
of current research groups is to enable the distribution and usage
of hydrogen in a safer, more economically viable manner. There are
indirect and direct hydrogen storage solutions, with the latter be-
ing direct ways to recover hydrogen after heating or pressurisation,
while the former need various steps before hydrogen is recovered.
The best known direct solutions for hydrogen storage include
metal  and  complex  hydrides,  whilst  indirect  solutions  include
steam  reforming  of  hydrocarbons  or  methanol,  hydrolysis  of  hy-
drides and decomposition of ammonia [38] . Organic hydrides such
as methyl cyclohexane (MCH) have also emerged as serious candi-
dates for storage of hydrogen. However, MCH also presents chal-
lenges, as it requires a complicated system for returning the base
fuel toluene from the point of consumption to the point of pro-
duction while carrying a low gravimetric mass of hydrogen [39] .
Similarly, most current technologies for direct storage fall short for
higher  gravimetric  hydrogen  density,  and  in  particular,  for  those
that allow hydrogen desorption at sufficiently low temperatures at
fast rates [38] .

For indirect solutions, methanol and ammonia currently appear
the most viable options, especially when related to full cells and
distribution systems, although ammonia presents an extra advan-
tage as it offers the possibility of truly carbon-free energy.

Recent investigations [40,41] have considered the development
of new materials for hydrogen storage, Fig. 5 . Ammonia possesses
one of the highest gravimetric hydrogen densities (17.8 wt%) with
the highest volumetric hydrogen densities (0.107 kg-H
2 /L), Fig. 5 .
Thus, effort s are f ocused on exploiting this quality to create new
technologies for ammonia conversion into hydrogen. Some results
demonstrate good feasibility for almost complete cracking of NH
3
into pure hydrogen [40] , presenting the former as an enabler for a
hydrogen economy.

Distribution  of  the  fuel  is  also  a  critical  parameter  to  con-
sider. Transportation of ammonia is now a mature technology af-
ter  over  a  century  of  development.  Recent  distribution  methods
have  appeared  to  reduce  complexity  and  the  potential  for  toxic
leaks. Metal amines are solid salts in which ammonia is attached
to a metal ion. From these, hexa-ammine-magnesium chloride has
been  considered  in  some  detail  as  an  indirect  hydrogen  carrier

gation of environmental impacts such as global warming potential,
abiotic depletion, etc. The study uses ammonia produced via wind
energy-based  water  electrolysis  using  molten  salt  electrolytes.  It
was shown that vehicles reduce their greenhouse gas (GHG) emis-
sions from 0.270 to 0.100 kg/km. Similarly, the production of 1 MJ
2  emis-
of electricity using ammonia results in a reduction of CO
sions from 0.130 to 0.083 kg CO
2 eq (with a time horizon of 500
years, GWP500). For power generation, the main global warming
potential  in  natural  gas  power  plants  is  based  on  the  combus-
tion  process  (i.e.  97%  production  of  GHGs),  while  in  the  ammo-
nia power plant the majority of GHGs (i.e. 93%) is due to the pro-
duction  of  ammonia,  with  only  6%  of  gases  with  global  warm-
ing potential being produced by the combustion system. Although
acidification (kg SO
2 eq/MJ) was two orders of magnitude greater
for  ammonia  due  to  potential  leaks,  ozone  layer  depletion  was
half the value when compared to natural gas power systems, i.e.
2.74 × 10 −9 and 5.92 × 10 −9 , respectively. Therefore, the greater po-
tential of ammonia for cleaner power can mitigate the production
of unwanted GHG emissions and contaminants.

In discussing ammonia storage, comparison with pure hydrogen
is always a point of contention. However, here the potential for in-

of  ammonia  (22  at  239.2 K)  is  lower  than  that  of  water  (81  at
298.2 K), so it is a better solvent for organic materials. However,
its dielectric constant is still high enough to allow ammonia to act
as a moderately good ionising solvent. Ammonia also self-ionises,
although less so than water [43] . The combustion of ammonia is
challenging, due primarily to its low reactivity, but yields nitrogen
gas and water, with a stoichiometric Air Fuel Ratio (AFR) of 6.06
by weight,

4NH3 + 3O2 → 2N2 + 6H2O + heat

(1)

Liquid ammonia is used extensively as a non-aqueous solvent.
The alkali metals as well as the heavier alkaline-earth metals and
even some inner transition metals dissolve in liquid ammonia.

It is transported and contained in tanks under modest pressure,
similar to propane. Production of ammonia as a transport vector
for  renewable  energy  and  its  subsequent  reconversion  to  hydro-
gen are energy intensive steps but the handling and shipping in-
frastructure including regulations for transportation are already in
place. It is potentially hazardous to inhale. However, ammonia is
readily detected by its odour, and being lighter than air it rapidly
dilutes  in  a  spill.  The  energy  content  of  ammonia  is  18.8 MJ/kg
(LHV), while hydrogen’s is 120 MJ/kg [43] .

Ammonia is known to have an indirect impact on ozone de-
pletion through the formation of nitrous compounds in the atmo-
sphere. These are currently considered a negligible contribution to
ozone depletion [44] , but will need to be considered for large scale
ammonia utilisation especially considering NOx production.

2.2. Health and safety

Although the H&S issues associated with the use of ammonia in
electricity/power generation are minimal when compared to trans-
portation, Table 1 , several considerations need to be taken into ac-
count. In addition, the increase in risk management legislation, in-
dustrial cases of dangerous circumstances, and human injuries in-
volving ammonia release [45] need to be taken into account.

The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), USA, has clas-
sified ammonia as a toxic substance, thus making it a chemical of
high risk for health [46] . However, due to its low reactivity, the
hazards it presents from accidental combustion or explosions are
much lower than other fuel gases and liquids, Fig. 6 .

Human  exposure  limits  of  ammonia  depend  on  the  legisla-
tion and exposure time. The limit is set between 25 and 50 ppm
with dangerous consequences for exposure to concentrations above
300 ppm. For instance, the UK Health and Safety Executive (HSE),
establishes  an  8 hrs  Time-Weighted  Average  (TWA)  of  25 ppm,
whilst its short-term exposure limit (STEL) is 35 ppm, compared to
a 20 ppm TWA and 50 ppm STEL for Europe [47,48] . Table 2 pro-
vides  some  exposure  guidance  according  to  the  NFPA.  The  vari-
ances clearly show that there is a need for research establishing
more accurate values for industries and a variety of potential users.
Interestingly, CO concentrations of 35 ppm TWA are recommended
by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) [49] .
A  further  set  of  recommendations  for  industrial  interests  is
given by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), USA, and is
known as Acute Exposure Guideline Levels (AEGL), which is used
for ammonia. There are 3 categories, Table 3 [50] .

AEGL-1  is  the  airborne  concentration  above  which  it  is  pre-
dicted that the general population, including susceptible individ-
uals,  could  experience  notable  discomfort,  irritation,  or  certain
asymptomatic,  non-sensory  effects.  However,  the  effects  are  not
disabling, and are transient and reversible upon cessation of ex-
posure.

AEGL-2  is  the  airborne  concentration  of  a  substance  above
which it is predicted that the general population, including sus-

since it has both high gravimetric and volumetric hydrogen con-
tent. Furthermore, it is prepared from magnesium chloride, which
is  abundant,  inexpensive,  binds  ammonia  reversibly,  and  can  be
considered  safe  [38] .  This  material  can  be  also  compacted  into
3 /m 3 ,  or
a  dense  material,  which  holds  approximately  615 kg-NH
2 /m 3 ,  almost  the  same  volumetric  ammonia  content  as
110 kg-H
that  of  liquid  ammonia.  Due  to  a  much  lower  ammonia  vapour
pressure (200 Pa) and release rate at room temperature, it is actu-
ally possible to handle this material safely at ambient conditions.
Thus, hexa-ammine-magnesium chloride (Mg(NH
2 ) and simi-
lar materials now present a commercially viable option to mitigate
the toxicity and corrosivity that liquid ammonia presents, justifying
further the distribution of hydrogen via ammonia [42] , although
current developments are based on applications such as NOx re-
duction.

Nevertheless, the use of hydrogen carriers other than ammonia
are being investigated. Despite the fact that in most industrial sec-
tors one solution among multiple options usually tends to achieve
a position of dominance, here it is conjectured that two or more
chemical storage technologies could co-exist for various shares in
the market. Although this is rare in most circumstances, hydrogen
carriers and ammonia can complement each other very well, hence
instead of competing, together supporting the transition of a car-
bon free economy. Thus, for ammonia to contribute to this eco-
nomic transition, new technologies need to be developed for its
consumption while allowing recovery of hydrogen with increased
efficiencies. This review, for that reason, presents various methods
of conversion from ammonia to power which seek to reduce in-
efficiencies across the whole process of conversion, transport and
recovery of hydrogen.

2. Background

2.1. General characteristics

Ammonia is a colourless gas with a sharp, penetrating odour.
Its boiling point is 239.8 K, and its freezing point 195.5 K, with a
density  of  0.73 kg/m 3  and  an  auto-ignition  temperature  of  930 K
(compared to methane, 859 K) under atmospheric conditions. With
an  octane  number  of  ∼130,  it  has  a  high  heat  of  vaporization
(1371 kJ/kg compared to ∼271 kJ/kg of gasoline) and can be han-
dled as a liquid in thermally insulated containers. The ammonia
molecule has a trigonal pyramidal shape with the three hydrogen
atoms  and  an  unshared  pair  of  electrons  attached  to  the  nitro-
gen atom. It is a polar molecule and is highly associated because
of strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding. The dielectric constant

According to some key points in the Compendium of Chemical
Hazards of ammonia from the Health Protection Agency (UK) [51] ,
ammonia has the following characteristics:

Fire

• Exposure by any route may be dangerous
• Secondary contamination may occur
• CHIP Classification: toxic and corrosive
• Acute inhalation may result in irritation of eyes and nose with
a sore throat, cough, chest tightness, headache and confusion
• Acute ingestion of ammonia solutions may result in burns to

the mouth and throat

• Acute skin exposure may result in deep burns
• Acute eye exposure may cause inflammation, lacrimation and

photophobia

• Chronic inhalation has been associated with increased cough,

phlegm production, wheeze and asthma

• Ammonia is not considered to be carcinogenic to humans
• Ammonia is not considered to be a human reproductive or de-

velopmental toxicant

• Environment
• Dangerous for the environment
• Inform Environment Agency of substantial release incidents

• Anhydrous ammonia is non-flammable. Ammonia vapour in air

is flammable and may explode when ignited

• Chemically stable under normal conditions
• Emits poisonous fumes when heated to decomposition
• Use fine water spray and liquid-tight protective clothing with

breathing apparatus

Even though it is toxic for humans and most invertebrates (but
not for fertilising purposes), ammonia is lighter than air, thus al-
lowing leakages to move quickly through the rising plume whilst
reducing exposure. However, it is usually released in ‘flashing’ liq-
uid form, resulting in a dense aerosol cloud which cools as it evap-
orates  –hence  atmospheric  dispersion  models  refer  to  low-lying,

cold, droplet laden dispersion, which possesses greater risks [52] .
Although it can be carried away due to its low density, eddy trans-
port of agents and large/small scale wind variations could occur
[53] . Ammonia can spread in a V-Pattern through buildings track-
ing wind; moisture and vegetation can also cause ammonia to be-
come more turbulent, rolling rather than laying out in a defined
pattern. Dry, windy and warm weather diffuses ammonia to the
atmosphere faster than humid, cool and low wind conditions. High
pressure inversions and humidity may cause the vapour to bounce
and return to ground level before completely diffusing. Therefore,
guidelines recommend always to have a refuge point upwind from
the point of storage/use of ammonia, taking into consideration the
larger scales. Moreover, although toxic, NH
3  becomes perceptible
at very low, safe concentrations and is not carcinogenic.

Ammonia  is  also  corrosive  when  mixed  with  water  as  pH
rapidly increases to 11.6. The corrosiveness of ammonia will mix
with body fluids like sweat and respiratory tract moisture to cause
irritation. The environmental threat increases when NH
3 goes into
a live body of water.

2.3. Fire/Explosions

Explosions with the sudden release of ammonia have been doc-
umented,  Fig.  7 .  The  build-up  of  pressure  due  to  the  boiling  of
the saturated liquid inside the container due to an external heat
source can produce situations where the cylinder is unable to re-
tain its structural integrity, resulting in rupture and release of the
contained gas. If sparks or a heat source are presented the likeli-
hood of explosion increases, with potentially catastrophic scenar-
ios. These phenomena are known as BLEVEs (Boiling Liquid Evap-
orating  Vapour  Explosions).  Although  this  has  only  been  docu-
mented in large industrial facilities and for large containers, care
is required when handling ammonia. Ammonia has a flammability
limit that ranges from ∼18 to 28% fuel mole fraction, Fig. 8 . There-
fore, dilution systems are needed to avoid this range when hot sur-
faces or combustion devices are in use nearby. The likelihood and
severity of ammonia combustion hazards are mitigated somewhat
by the fuel’s slow reaction characteristics, particularly its relatively
high ignition energy (2–3 orders of magnitude higher than com-
mon hydrocarbons) and low laminar burning rate more than four
times less than methane ( < 0.010 m/s).

2.4. Corrosive nature of ammonia

An important parameter to consider when selecting a chemical
for power applications either as a working fluid or fuel is to recog-
nise the impact of the former on materials required for pipelines
and structural components, thus increasing the complexity of some
systems and potential applicability of such chemical. In the case
of ammonia, the benefits of greater versatility than hydrogen get

3  should not be mixed with
bromine, chlorine, iodine and hypochlorites as ammonia is an al-
kaline reducing agent and reacts with acids, halogens, and oxidiz-
ing agents. Cole–Parmer [55] have produced a comprehensive but
not exhaustive list of compatibility results between ammonia and
various industrial materials, Table 4 . Thus, careful material selec-
tion needs to be performed when considering ammonia for power
generation.

2.5. Current position of ammonia for power

2.5.1. Production process

Historically,  ammonia  has  been  manufactured  as  a  fertilizer
to enhance food production via the well-established Haber–Bosch

process. Approximately 97% of nitrogen fertilizers are derived from
ammonia  [56] .  In  the  latter,  high  purity  (99.99%)  hydrogen  and
nitrogen are typically reacted together at a temperature between
623.2 and 823.2 K at pressures between 10 to 25 MPa in the pres-
ence of a catalytic material [9] . The hydrogen is mainly sourced
from hydrocarbons - obtained from steam reforming of methane
and partial oxidation of coal - resulting in a highly carbon inten-
sive process [57] . The production of ammonia consumes an esti-
mated  1.8% −3.0%  of  all  global  energy  [56] ,  mainly  via  fossil  fu-
els, making it one of the single largest producers of carbon diox-
ide. Moreover, the production process generates vast quantities of
NOx that through Best Available Techniques need to be removed
via Selective non-catalytic reduction, thus increasing cost of oper-
ation [56] . Therefore, new technologies seek to produce hydrogen
from carbon-free sources such as electrolysis of water using sus-
tainable energy,  thus  mitigating the  excessive  production  of  car-
bon  emissions  while  increasing  flexibility  of  production  and  re-
covery of stranded sources internationally. Recent energy studies
[58] conducted using data obtained from the facility at Leuna, Ger-
many, determined that the use of water electrolysis and pressure
swing adsorption (PSA) to develop decentralised Haber–Bosch pro-
cesses are feasible options as potentially competitive systems for
the  production  of  ammonia,  which  can  be  employed  for  energy
storage. Currently, ammonia production from electrolysed hydro-
gen accounts for approximately 0.5% of global ammonia produc-
tion [9] . However, the greatest limitation to this process are the
economics, which are continually being improved through studies
that have been conducted to show the considerable potential for
the production of hydrogen and ammonia via electrolysis product
of sustainable sources, Fig. 9 , with companies already investigat-
ing the development of  industrial facilities to  pursue the reduc-
tion  of  GHGs  while  improving  feedstock  and  resilience  of  these
ammonia production methods. Nuclear power has also been con-
sidered  [59] ,  although  initial  Life  Cycle  Assessments  show  their
detrimental impact on various aspects related to confinement and
disposal  of  radioactive  material,  Fig.  10 ,  thus  making  renewable
sources the most promising alternative for the near to intermediate
future.

As  stated,  current  ammonia  production  (brown  ammonia)  is
mainly  produced  through  reformation  of  hydrogen  from  natural
gas  [60] ,  thus  producing  an  annual  global  total  of  ∼290Mt  of
2 , approximately 1% of carbon dioxide emissions. Unless these
CO
emissions are captured and stored or utilised, the sustainability of
any new cycle running on brown ammonia is significantly detri-
mentally affected. Therefore, it is highly desirable for the hydro-
gen obtained for the production of ammonia to be obtained from
alternative  sustainable  sources  such  as  wind,  biomass  gasifica-

tion, solar. Recent research has been undertaken to determine en-
ergy requirements from various renewable technologies to produce
green ammonia [60] , showing that the use of biomass can poten-
tially produce higher CO
2  emissions but at lower power require-
ments  (although  these  processes  may  be  carbon  neutral),  while
other sources such as wind/solar can have negligible carbon emis-
sions  with  reduced  power  consumption  compared  to  fossil  ref-
NH3  for  green  ammonia  compared  to
ormation,  i.e.  14.248 kW/kg
17.113 kW/kg
NH3  for  brown  ammonia,  hence  demonstrating  that
ammonia can be produced via renewables to increase the sustain-
able, greener nature of new power cycles.

2.5.2. Market

The consensus among analysts is that there is a high degree of
uncertainty regarding the future outlook for the grid-scale energy
storage market because of the lack of established storage technolo-
gies and the uncertainty concerning government subsidies and reg-
ulatory frameworks to incentivise markets around the world. How-
ever, a number of analysts have attempted to estimate the size of
the worldwide energy storage market: the Energy Research Part-
nership [61] concluded the global market could be worth in ex-
cess of $600bn over the coming 10–12 years while Navigant Re-
search  estimate  global  investment  in  energy  storage  would  total
$68bn  between  2014  and  2024,  and  be  worth  over  15$bn/yr  by
2024 [62] .

Hence, since ammonia is a disruptive energy storage technol-
ogy that can be realised using existing processes for the synthesis
and storage of ammonia, it can then benefit from the economic
predictions previously stated, as it has the potential to be brought
to market both relatively quickly and in significant volume. Gener-
ally, the ammonia market is estimated at $91–225bn per year [63] .
Therefore its production for either power or agriculture will permit
more flexible energy options worldwide. It is difficult to estimate
the effect of a reliable decoupling mechanism on the energy mix as
a whole. However it is possible to estimate the effect of a percent-
age swing to the renewables away from the combined gas power
generation. The economic cost to society of a 1% swing would be
around  $1.5bn  a  year  worldwide,  thus  showing  highly  profitable
profiles for interested companies working on the topic.

For these scenarios to happen, capital costs for ammonia tech-
nologies need to be competitive against other forms of energy stor-
age. Estimates of the capital costs ($/kW) for ammonia energy stor-
age (between 1350 and 1590 $/kW [29] ) indicate it will be compet-
itive compared to battery storage technologies such as Li-ion, NaS
and VREDOX (between 850 and 3,660 $/kW [64] ), but with the ad-
vantage of considerably cheaper ( ∼2(O)) capacity costs inherent in

atti, Samara) to Odessa in the Black Sea and is one of the largest
( ∼2400 km long) with a capacity of 3 million tons per year [66] .

However,  a  number  of  competing  technologies  are  also  un-
der intensive development, including compressed air, thermal, and
electrochemical  (battery)  storage,  and  so  predicting  with  confi-
dence penetration into this uncertain market is challenging.

2.5.3. Distribution

Anhydrous (without water) ammonia is distributed across the
world via pipelines, railroads, barges, ships, road trailers and stor-
age deports. Long term experience of ammonia distribution from
the first quarter of the first century has facilitated the global de-
ployment of ammonia, ensuring that well established distribution
networks exist across the world.

In the USA, the NuStar Line (3070 km long) transports ammonia
from Mississippi into the heart of the corn-belt region of the cen-
tral and northern States of the Union, where it can be distributed
still further via the Magellan line ( ∼1900 km long). Both lines de-
liver approximately 2.9 million tons of ammonia per year [65] . In
Eastern  Europe,  a  pipeline  runs  from  TogliattiAzot’s  plant  (Toly-

Western Europe alone transports around 1.5 million tonnes of
ammonia by railway every year. Pipeline transport of liquid am-
monia in the European Union is not as significant as in the US and
in Russia. Only relatively short pipeline systems are in operation.
Greater quantities are transported using insulated tank cars capa-
ble of storing up to 126,800 litres [67] . When pipeline or railway
connections are not possible, then large barges, road trailers, nurse
tanks and even bottles are used to transport ammonia across re-
gions. Therefore, vast infrastructure exists to support the concept
of using ammonia for distribution of stored energy.

3. Ammonia for power

Grid-connected energy storage is widely accepted as an enabler
for further deployment of renewables. As energy networks incor-
porate more decentralised power generation, storage is also likely
to play a significant role in load balancing and strengthening dis-
tribution grids. Significant renewable resources are often found in

generation fuel [72] . Moreover, further works would follow to use
ammonia as working fluid in advanced cycles, thus wide spreading
the chemical for power generation purposes.

3.2. Ammonia power cycles

Although ammonia as a working fluid or carbon dioxide scrub-
ber material in power cycles is not directly linked to the use of
the chemical for energy storage, utilisation of NH
3 into these cy-
cles can present an opportunity to initially recover the chemical
for storage, use it as working fluid and finally employ it for release
of energy via fuel cells, engines, rockets or other technologies, in-
creasing overall system efficiency. Thus, a comprehensive review of
the literature on the use of ammonia in power cycles is presented
to complement the various uses of ammonia for power.

3.2.1. As working fluid in power cycles

In  1984,  Alexander  Kalina  developed  a  cycle  to  be  used  as  a
bottoming  cycle  instead  of  the  Rankine  cycle  in  Combined  Cy-
cle (CC) power plants and demonstrated that the cycle can reach
higher efficiencies than the Rankine cycle for heat recovery [73] .
The  essence  of  the  cycle  is  the  use  of  an  ammonia-water  mix-
ture whose change in composition affects the thermodynamics and
transport properties of the mixture. Since the boiling temperature
of ammonia is lower than water it can then be used for low grade
heat  recovery.  Moreover,  designs  for  steam  turbines  can  still  be
used with such a mixture due to the close molecular weight be-
tween water and ammonia [74] . The use of the Kalina Cycle (KC)
with this ammonia-water working fluid can bring up to 20% en-
hancement compared to other cycles [75] . Therefore, it has been
used  for  recovery  of  renewable  energies  produced  from  sources
such as geothermal applications, coal-fired steam plants, triple cy-
cles, gas turbine modular helium reactor heat recovery, solar plants
( Fig.  12 ),  etc.  [74,76]  and  even  conventional  power  applications
such as diesel engines [77] .

Related work has suggested that mixtures of 84% ammonia –
16% water (in mass fraction) can produce superior thermodynamic
and economic benefits [78] . It has been recognised that combina-
tions of the cycle with mixtures between 78% to 82% of ammonia
concentration can provide the best operating conditions in such a
cycle [75] , with some authors even suggesting concentrations as
low as 50% for especial geothermal applications [79] . Therefore, the
importance of ammonia in the performance of the cycle is clear,
allowing  researchers  to  explore  its  properties  and  concentration
changes through the cycle to unveil problems such as irreversibili-
ties that can lead to potential design improvements [75] . More re-
cent studies have been concentrated on improvements to the cycle,
especially for geothermal applications [80,81] .

The use of the cycle at higher temperatures is questionable due
to the nitridation effect, resulting from thermal decomposition of
ammonia, that can potentially corrode equipment [79] . However,
further  work  by  Kalina  and  other  researchers  has  demonstrated
its successful usage at higher temperatures under industrial condi-
tions [76] . Therefore, research groups have also sought to evaluate
the use of ammonia-water mixtures for energy recovery from high
energy devices such as concentrated solar power plants. However,
such studies concluded that the use of the cycle was more expen-
sive than the use of state-or-the-art steam Rankine cycles, present-
ing a difference of ∼20% cost per MWh −1 [76] . Further studies have
sought improvements of systems with both high temperature and
pressure inlets ( > 773 K, > 10 MPa).  New numerical designs based
on the number of recuperators through the cycle, turbine outlet
pressure, separator inlet temperature and the separator inlet am-
monia mass fraction played an important factor to maximise cycle
efficiency up to 31.47% with an ammonia concentration of 80% [82] .

isolated geographies or locations with no grid access. Examples in-
clude the wind resources in the mid-West of the US and the north
of the United Kingdom (e.g. the Orkneys or Hebrides), and Pho-
tovoltaic  resources  in  Africa,  the  Middle  East  and  Australia.  The
cost of a conventional distribution grid connection can be a signif-
icant barrier to exploiting such resources. Ammonia, on the other
hand, is competitive against a variety of transmission systems, Fig.
11 [68] . Therefore, the viability of ammonia as an energy carrier
rests on the overall conversion efficiency of the process, including
the ability to convert it at the necessary power levels at the point
of consumption with minimal environmental impact.

3.1. Initial attempts to use ammonia for power

The industrial revolution brought an endless number of patents
and new devices for power and transportation, with most utilis-
ing steam as the preferred working fluid. This was not always the
case, with some inventors seeking competitive advantage through
the development of new, more complex systems. Sir Goldsworthy
Gurney - pioneer of the use of oxygen and hydrogen for lighting
and transportation devices - built upon, amongst others the work
of Trevithick’s steam carriage, to develop what was probably the
first ammonia gas locomotive, which required little change from an
ordinary steam engine [69] . However, resistance from others with
vested interests opposed the new invention and he faced competi-
tion from steam railways, which was backed by large financial and
political  capital.  Similarly,  there  were  attempts  to  replace  horse
drawn street-cars in New Orleans with ammonia powered engines,
although these lost out to electrification projects [70] . Hence it was
not until the 20th century that transport solutions based on am-
monia were developed.

The  first  part  of  the  20th  century  also  saw  the  development
of  what  became  known  as  the  Haber–Bosch  process,  where  at-
mospheric nitrogen is fixed to industrially produced ammonia. It
is named after its inventors, Fritz Haber and Carl Bosch, who ob-
tained the Nobel Prize for this work. The production of ammonia in
this way revolutionized farming by introducing a cheap and readily
available fertilizer, and it is estimated that half the world’s pop-
ulation increase is due to the use of fertilizers produced via the
Haber-Bosch  (HB)  process  [71] .  Nitrogen  fixed  from  air  played  a
pivotal role in armament production in Germany in World War I
and II for production of ammonium nitrate which has also been
used as a transport fuel where diesel and petrol were not avail-
able. For instance due diesel shortages in Belgium during World
War II, engineers adapted approximately 100 buses to run on liq-
uid ammonia. Although this experiment only lasted until carbon-
based fuels were available again, the use of ammonia with a small
3 could be used as power
amount of coal gas demonstrated that NH

showed an increase in Coefficient of Performance (COP) and cool-
ing efficiency, with a net power output increase of ∼400 kW. This
is a consequence of the air leaving the evaporator of the system
at cooler temperatures. Low grade heating sources have also been
studied through numerical and parametric analyses, showing that
combination of power and cooling provide higher exergy efficien-
cies (available useful power) and net power outputs [91] .

Cooling  and  power  generation  can  also  be  combined  to  pro-
duce water heating through the use of ammonia-water mixtures,
as demonstrated numerically by Mohammadi et al. [92] who pro-
posed a plant capable of producing 30 kW power employing 8 kW
cooling with efficiencies above 67%. Similar studies have been con-
ducted  to  determine  energy  and  exergy  values  for  solar  driven
systems  [93] ,  optimization  of  three-stage  (Brayton,  Rankine  and
Kalina) combined cycle power systems [94] and flue-gas energy re-
covery from devices such as gas turbines, internal combustion en-
gines and high temperature fuel cells [95] . The cycle can also be
combined with energy solutions such as gasification and solid fuel
cells, thus achieving high efficiencies > 58% with alternative energy
sources  [96] .  The  results  demonstrate  that  the  use  of  ammonia-
water cycles can not only increase efficiency, but also provide ver-
satility of operation at medium power outputs.

Versatility of ammonia and its properties allow the chemical to
be used also as an organic fluid for power generation in Organic
Rankine Cycles (ORC). Due to its properties, it has been compared
to other fluids such as R245fa, R236ea, isobutene, isopentane, pen-
tane, toluene to support energy production from the conversion of
renewable energy [97,98] . During some of the tests conducted to
develop Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) systems, which
are essentially technologies based on platforms that generate en-
ergy  through  temperature  differential  to  drive  heat  engines,  the
use of ammonia as the working fluid has showed a higher work
capacity than other organic working fluids [97] . Therefore, the use
of ammonia in these technologies has increased over the years. It
must be noted that although ammonia has the properties to allow
production of vapour to run turbines at low temperature differen-
tials [98] , the technology is still controversial in the sea due to the
toxic properties of NH

3 to water living organisms.
Some futuristic designs have also considered the use of water
and/or ammonia heat transfer cycles for smaller systems such as
lightweight space radiators [99] . Due to the heavy reliability on ra-
diator subsystems in space, increased efficiency coupled with re-
duced mass is of strategic importance in space thermal systems.
Thus, this research showed that after evaluating various working
fluids,  the  most  promising  design  would  be  a  carbon  composite
heat pipe with a working fluid of liquid water or ammonia and
triangular fans.

3.2.2. Carbon capture and storage

One way to increase energy efficiency is by improving combus-
tion processes that use fossil fuels. Thermal efficiencies have been
increased as a consequence of new materials and designs that al-
low higher temperature combustion systems. These new properties
have  established  fundamental  concepts  for  more  advanced  tech-
niques that not only increase combustion efficiency but also are
capable of ensuring low carbon dioxide emissions as part of the
global commitment to tackle climate change.

One of these techniques is the use of carbon capture and stor-
age  (CCS)  systems  via  post-combustion  capture.  The  concept  is
based on recovering CO
2 at the end of the gas turbine, once that
power has been produced using conventional fuels [100–103] . For
this aim amine scrubbing is the main process in which aqueous
solutions of alkyl amines are used to react with carbon dioxide to
capture it from exhaust gases. Aqueous monoethanolamine (MEA)
2  [104] . The
is the most commonly used amine for scrubbing CO
stable  and  reliable  properties  of  monoethanolamine  derive  from

Fig. 12.  Kalina cycle with central solar receiver. Reprinted from [76] with permis-
sion from J Energy Conversion and Management, Elsevier.

When the KC is integrated to other cycles such as the Rankine,
the system can be operated in various ways to provide power in
non-heating seasons and power plus heat during the winter, thus
allowing operation as either a Kalina cycle or an ammonia-water
Rankine  cycle  (AWRC)  [83] .  Studies  on  these  cycles  have  shown
that increasing the ammonia mass fraction increases the total ex-
ergy destruction cost rate as well as unit cost of electricity pro-
duced by the turbine, showing the benefits of using an ammonia-
water mixture [74] .

Ammonia is also considered a good refrigerant, with high po-
tential  for  future  use  in  domestic  applications  in  addition  to  its
current large industrial use, i.e. in breweries and warehouses [84] .
Due  to  its  low  Global  Warming  Potential  –relative  heat  trapped
2 - (GWP < 1 based on a 100 year time
by the gas compared to CO
horizon),  high  critical  pressure  and  low  Cp,  some  commentators
believe  ammonia  could  become  one  of  the  most  used  refriger-
ants of the future for small scale devices, especially if advances in
mixture can be combined with revolutionary heat exchanger de-
signs at microscale level [84–88] . Furthermore, recent studies have
used the KC for power generation in combination with ammonia-
water  absorption  refrigeration  to  cogenerate  power  and  cooling.
The  use  of  throttling  valves,  evaporators  and  removal  of  expan-
sible  working  fluid  for  cooling  provided  14–49%  higher  efficien-
cies with 3.6–70 times higher generated cooling quantities, show-
ing that high ammonia mass fractions produce better performance
and lower costs [89] . A similar study has been conducted with a
Brayton-Rankine combined cycles to integrate ammonia-water re-
frigeration [90] . The study placed a particular emphasis on the ef-
fect of the ammonia condenser temperature on the plant perfor-
mance between summer and winter, i.e. from 313 to 278 K. Results

its primary amine and primary alcohol composition. Thus, it has
been assessed for its use in fossil power plants to reduce carbon
2  process  is  reversible,  up  to  80%  of  the
footprint.  Since  the  CO
emissions can be captured but through a highly energy intensive
process [105] . Another challenge for this technology is the low re-
action temperature needed to increase the chemical reaction effi-
ciency - since the CO
2  is released at elevated temperatures - re-
sulting in the requirement for flue gases cooling before scrubbing.
One way in which capture efficiency can be increased is by us-
ing a low cost solvent capable of lowering the energy requirements
for regeneration whilst allowing higher CO
2 loading capacity than
that of MEA. Ciferno et al. [106] suggested the use of aqueous am-
2 ca-
monia as an alternative solvent, potentially increasing the CO
pacity and lowering parasitic loads by 15%, with a decrease of net
power plant heat rate of 15% compared to MEA, Fig. 13 . Moreover,
other compounds such as SOx, NOx and mercury could also be re-
moved along with ammonia, making it an attractive chemical for
multi-pollutant capture in power plants [107] . Aqueous ammonia
does not present the problem of absorbent degradation caused by
sulphur and oxygen in the flue gas, while MEA is susceptible to
this degradation [108] . Finally, MEA has a maximum absorption of
MEA  with  a  removal  efficiency  of  90%  compared  to
0.36  kg
0.9 kg
NH3 and an absorption efficiency between 95% to 98%
for aqueous ammonia [109] .

CO2 /kg

CO2 /kg

As amines share many material compatibilities with ammonia,
retrofitting an MEA scrubber for an ammonia system would be of
relatively low cost. Another benefit is the low cost of the ammo-
nia process compared to MEA, which is only ∼70% (67.3$/tonne v
86.4$/tonne) of the price of the latter in an ammonia market with
a decreasing cost trend, a consequence of the increased production
of ammonia from developing countries [110] .

Although  the  use  of  ammonia  as  a  carbon  capture  solvent  is
possible [111] , there are challenges before industrial deployment of
this technology. For example, the temperature of the flue gas has to
be lowered for CO
2 absorption with ammonia that could vaporize
in the absorption towers, causing health and safety issues. Equally,
2 depend on pressure, pH and temperature,
NH
making the application of ammonia carbon capture more flexible
but potentially more difficult to control than MEA processes. How-
ever, it is recognised that good progress can be achieved with even
further potential of improvement employing ammonia-based sys-
tems [110] .

3.3. Fuel cells

Recently, researchers have proposed a way of making it easier
and cheaper to run hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles by filling them with
ammonia. The ammonia can be stored easily in tanks similar to
those found in gasoline filling stations and then cracked using rel-
atively cheap sodium or lithium catalysts rather than the current
expensive transition metal catalyst systems [112,113] . At the recent
ARPA-E’s Summit [114] , Director Grigorii Soloveichik presented his
vision  for  future  transportation  using  hybrid  vehicles  that  com-
bine  plug-in  batteries  and  fuel  cells.  He  presented  the  different
driving ranges of various sustainable fuels, emphasizing the poten-
tial of ammonia. In terms of energy density, liquid ammonia con-
tains 15.6 MJ/L, which is 70% more than liquid hydrogen (9.1 MJ/L
at cryogenic temperature) or almost three times more than com-
pressed hydrogen (5.6 MJ/L at 70 MPa). In terms of driving range, a
60.6 L fuel tank of ammonia provides a driving range of 756 km,
almost  twice  the  range  of  the  same  volume  of  liquid  hydrogen
(417 km) and three times the range of the same volume of com-
pressed hydrogen (254 km) [114] .

Fuel  cells  (FC)  using  ammonia  have  also  been  studied  exten-
sively  for  stationary  power  generation  and  as  power  sources  for
transport. Although most cells developed to-date are based on hy-
drogen as fuel, it is recognised that the storage of hydrogen for
such  purposes  is  still  challenging  and  expensive.  Thus,  chemical
storage  of  hydrogen  in  other  liquid  fuels  could  provide  a  solu-
tion for high density chemical energy storage. Methanol, ethanol,
n-octane, ammonia and methane are potential candidates to sup-
ply H
2 to these fuel cells. Therefore, the concept of integrated fuel
processor and fuel cell (FP-FC) has gained considerable attention in
the last decade.

Investigations using ammonia, which undergoes thermal crack-
ing  within  a  high  temperature  fuel  cell  to  produce  hydrogen
and  nitrogen  at  the  anode  [116] ,  have  shown  that  the  maxi-
mum  amount  of  work  that  can  be  obtained  from  ammonia  is
∼0.33 MJ/mol
NH3 ,  although  if  the  work  is  calculated  in  terms  of
2  that can be obtained from the cracking of ammonia, the
the H
maximum value is 0.22 MJ/mol
CrackedH2 , a value that is similar to
other  more  conventional  fuels,  i.e.  methane,  n-octane,  methanol,
etc. [117] . Thus, ammonia can be used indirectly to produce the
required hydrogen for energy production in fuel cells, as the am-
monia is cracked by the anode within the cell and thus there is

studied by many research groups with a view to developing new
automotive  units  via  Solid  Oxide  FCs.  Energy  produced  by  vari-
ous electrolytes has been studied, finding that proton-conducting
electrolytes (SOFC –H + ) have superior efficiencies to ion-conducting
electrolytes (SOFC –O) [127–129] . This is confirmed in [130] where
SOFC are shown to have significant advantages on combination of
environment-friendly power generation with fuel flexibility.

For the use of combined heat and power applications in auto-
motive systems, Fig. 15 , it has also been recognised that SOFC –H +
systems can reach efficiencies in the range of 40–60% and exergies
of 60–90% based on the conditions of operation. Moreover, reduc-
tion in cost, size and operating temperature demonstrate that the
technology has a future in transportation [131] . However, loss of
the exergy in SOFCs remains a significant technological challenge
and  the  efficiencies  are  highly  dependent  on  temperature  varia-
tions  [116] ,  requiring  further  research  in  this  topic  to  make  the
technology competitive to other ammonia-based systems.

The advantages of FCs have allowed some researchers to inte-
grate FCs in other energy production units creating hybrid systems
that produce energy in the ∼kW range. For example, simulations
of a system using solid oxide fuel cells and a Stirling engine for
a bottoming cycle in a power plant were conducted using ammo-
nia as main fuel [132] . It was found that the simplest design was
achieved using ammonia as it can be directly fed into the fuel cell
unlike other potential fuels such as natural gas, DME, ethanol and
methanol which required fore-line reforming. It was found that it
was sufficient to preheat NH
3 to the desired inlet temperature of
923 K  with  no  requirement  for  desulphurisation  or  pre-reformer
reactors.  However,  the  efficiency  of  the  total  hybrid  cycle  using
ammonia was the lowest (57.9%) due to the higher mass fuel flow
rates, lack of reformers to increase operating temperature and less
energy  for  the  bottoming  cycle.  Similarly,  the  reduction  of  inlet
temperature showed minimum changes using ammonia compared
to all the other fuels. The results for the solid oxide fuel cell using
ammonia were similar to those from other sources that showed ef-
ficiencies ∼50% [116] . Other studies carried out by Wei and En-ke
[133] demonstrated that the use of ammonia to fuel SOFC provides
more sustainable energy production than the use of gasoline, diesel
and even hydrogen in a driving range of 100 km.

Other  researchers  have  also  worked  in  improving  the  perfor-
mance  of  ammonia  based  fuel  cells  using  various  materials  and
film configurations to increase currency at lower degradation rates.
Liu et al. [134] used Scandia-stabilized Zirconia (SSZ) based thin
films  to  obtain  high  power  output  performance  from  ammonia,
showing that ammonia generated higher power densities than hy-
drogen  based  FCs  at  particular  temperatures  (973  and  1023 K).
Similar work was performed by Zhang et al. [135] and Ma et al.
[136] who demonstrated that at 1073–1123 K Yttria-stabilised Zir-

no  need  for  a  fore-line  ammonia  reformer  [115] ,  Fig.  14 .  There-
fore, ammonia, as a well-established fuel with decades of synthe-
sis, handling and utilisation expertise across the world, started at-
tracting significant attention as fuel for fuel cells during the last
decade [118–123] .

Moreover, ammonia fuel cells can also be used to recover waste
energy from low temperature process streams. Zhu et al. [124] re-
ported that low-grade thermal energy can be converted into elec-
tricity  using  ammonia  regenerative  batteries.  The  batteries  were
assessed at different solution concentrations, flow rates, cell pairs
and circuit connections to study their performance, which reached
a 5% energy efficiency relative to the Carnot efficiency. As in other
fuel cells, current could be increased using stacked cells, showing
that the technology could be a promising option for future waste
recovery.

Therefore, this review highlights the considerable evolution of
fuel cells technology over the past decade, suggesting that further
developments  are  highly  likely  and  that  fuel  cell  will  remain  a
plausible option for the use of ammonia for power applications.

Fuel  cells  are  categorized  according  to  their  operating  condi-
tions  and  electrolyte  material,  with  six  major  systems  as  follow
[125] ,

• Alkaline FC
• Phosphoric Acid FC
• Solid Oxide FC (SOFC)
• Molten Carbonate FC
• Proton Exchange/Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM) FC
• Direct Methanol FC

Another  category  that  could  fit  into  the  molten  systems  is

Molten Hydroxides [126] .

3.3.1. Solid oxide FC

The  relatively  small  size  of  FCs  make  them  good  candidates
for small scale energy production, i.e. distributed energy systems
such as family homes, mobile applications such as cars and small
commercial vehicles, small industrial processes, etc. For example,
vehicular  applications  of  ammonia  based  fuel  cells  are  currently

conia (YSZ) thin films running on ammonia had a comparable per-
formance to those obtained from using hydrogen as a fuel, with
the cell fuelled by ammonia displaying the same electrolyte resis-
tance but a slightly larger interfacial polarization resistance [136] .
Moreover,  Fuerte  et  al.  [137]  demonstrated  that  such  a  cell  has
an internal resistance that behaves independent of the used fuel
and that only slight differences exist in polarization resistance and
low  current  density  at  973 K,  probably  due  to  a  slower  ammo-
nia decomposition at this temperature. Experiments demonstrated
that no severe changes or deterioration to cell performance were
observed  after  long  operation  periods,  Fig.  16 .  Other  researchers
[138]  carried  out  experiments  with  a  fuel  cell  that  incorporated
nickel and a doubly doped barium-cerate electrolyte and an anode
of europium doped barium cerate. The activity of the fuel cell was
reported to be superior to other catalysts, with results that sug-
gested that ammonia could be used as a fuel at temperatures as
low as 723 K.

Xie et al. [139] reported the development of a number of dif-
3 −δ (BCNO) pow-
ferent electrolytes amongst which BaCe
ders were deposited as a thin layer on NiO-BCNO anodes with La
0.5
3 −δ used as cathodes. These cells were tested with am-
Sr
monia and hydrogen and their results showed good performance
with ammonia, with a power density of 3150 W/m 2  compared to
3350 W/m 2 produced when using H
2, and both producing voltages
of ∼0.95 V. Similar work has been carried out by other institutions
using  other  ceramic  composites  [140–143]  and ammonia blends
[144] demonstrating that efficiencies of the fuel cell can increase
up to 30% depending on the blend’s lower heating value as well as
material properties.

Some studies have developed thermo-electrochemical analyses
using 2D Computation Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models in order to
determine the performance of ammonia-fuelled SOFCs. The studies
considered reactions and heat and mass transfer, finding that the
decomposition of ammonia greatly increases at high temperatures
above 970 K and has a significant impact on the electrical output of
the fuel cell. Moreover, inlet temperatures were found to influence
the performance of the device, with higher temperatures decreas-
ing the electrolyte Nernst potential. Although a higher inlet tem-
perature is desirable to achieve higher electric outputs, the results
suggest that careful consideration is required to determine the in-
let temperature into the system. The simulations carried out sug-

gested that a decrease in operating potential can increase fuel uti-
lization considerably by reducing negative temperature gradients
and that a reduction in inlet gas velocity was an effective method
to reduce the temperature gradient produced by the decrease in
ammonia decomposition. Further analyses on SOFC technology can
be found in the comprehensive review by Afif et al. [125] .

Most recent achievements have been attained using SOFCs. Ky-
oto University announced a new device able to produce power out-
puts  of  one  kilowatt.  The  device  attained  “direct  current  power
generation  efficiency” in  excess  of  50%  and  reached  1,0 0 0  hours
of continuous operation [145] . Although the report claims that this
is the most powerful device of its type, the longevity of the de-
vice is also of note. The group has been working with nickel based
materials [146] , and zirconia, which although inferior to gadolinia
at the time, was taken forward probably as a consequence of its
durability. This fuel cell uses direct supply of ammonia, demon-
strating that the power generated from ammonia was at the same
level  as  the  one  using  hydrogen.  Previous  studies  performed  by
the group tested different types of ammonia SOFCs, thus provid-
ing further data for this development [147] . Kyoto University also
announced the use of auto-thermal cracking devices to modulate
the power production of these fuel cells, demonstrating the pos-
sibility of high-speed activation without using external heating of
NH

3 -based SOFC.

3.3.2. Alkaline FC

Alkaline FC have also been studied over the years, with works
that  go  back  to  the  1960s  [125] .  Experimental  trials  [148]  have
demonstrated that in contrast to acid PEM fuel cells, alkaline FC
can tolerate ammonia. Because of the simplicity of the conversion
reaction  and  the  absence  of  carbon  monoxide  and  carbon  diox-
ide, hydrogen produced by ammonia cracking is ideal to fuel al-
kaline fuel cells. Thus, new programs of development have started
in various parts of the world. Specifically, The Alkammonia Project
aims  to  test  the  efficiency  of  alkaline  ammonia-fed  fuel  cells  in
providing power in remote areas for telecom base stations, usu-
ally powered by diesel engines [149] . These types of projects are
assessed by groups such as Cox et al [150] who recently carried
out  Life  Cycle  Assessments  for  Alkaline  Fuel  Cells  (AFCs)  fuelled
with cracked ammonia including all the components of these de-
vices and comparing them to diesel engines, Fig. 17 . The results

suggest that recycling of components can have a relatively small
impact on costs, but further research is required on improving cell
lifetime,  power  density  and  fuel  consumption.  It  should  be  em-
phasized  that  the  results  are  highly  dependent  upon  the  source
of ammonia used (either reforming, electrolysing, partial oxidation
or  biomass  gasification).  Studies  like  these  are  extremely  scarce,
making them now a priority to move forward in the deployment
of large scale projects using ammonia. Some other developments
have been presented through the years, with specific emphasis on
using alkaline fuel cells for transport applications. The work done
by the group of Kordesch et al. and the Argonne National Labo-
ratory [151] has led to the development of AFCs capable of being
implemented in cars such as the Silver Volt, where high efficiency
(99.99% conversion) cracking devices are employed to fed the for-
mer, allowing a 386 km range with only 80 L of ammonia.

Other  research  has  allowed  the  use  of  alkaline  media  to  di-
rectly electro-oxidize in AFCs some chemical compounds that are
high-energy density chemical hydrogen storage fuels such as boron
based materials, one in particular containing ammonia is ammo-
nia borane (AB), material that has a standard theoretical potential
of 1.615 V, higher than other fuel cell fuels. Nickel based carbon-
supported electrocatalysts such as Ni
3 Co/C are showing their po-
tential  and  greater  stability  compared  to  platinum  or  palladium,
especially when it comes to use AB oxidation. Thus, the use of Al-
kaline Fuel Cells has also an important role to play in progressing
to a hydrogen through ammonia economy, especially since costs
are lower to other technologies such as PEM [152] .

3.3.3. Molten hydroxide FC

Direct ammonia-fuelled molten hydroxide fuel cells [126] have
recently received fair attention for the use of ammonia. The suc-
cessful electrochemical oxidation of ammonia using these devices
was confirmed, with constant reactions maintained at 473–493 K
using flows of 97% ammonia purity over Pt electrodes. Although
the feasibility of direct ammonia fuelled FCs was confirmed, these
systems still require further development due to their low perfor-
mance when compared to more mature technologies. Further re-
search  performed  by  Lomocso  et  al.  [153]  and  Assumpcao  et  al.
[154] suggest that the use of other materials such as Iridium in
combination with Pt could considerably increase the performance
of these devices, although this simultaneously increases their cost.

3.3.4. Proton exchange membrane FC

The use of Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) FCs has gained
considerable  interest  in  the  generation  of  small  scale  power

2 O

( ∼5 kW) over the last decade. These systems require a clean hy-
drogen source. Since production of hydrogen from reforming pro-
cesses is complex, ammonia has been presented as a potential al-
ternative due to the null existence of carbon molecules that can
poison the anodes of the fuel cell [155] . For fuel cells, ammonia
needs  to  be  almost  completely  decomposed  ( > 99.5%)  at  around
atmospheric  pressure,  a  process  that  requires  high  temperatures
for both thermodynamic and kinetic reasons. Studies of the reac-
tions that occur between ammonia and hydrogen using different
catalytic materials have received considerable attention. The reac-
tions that occurs between 793 and 963 K using Ni-Pt/Al
3  were
evaluated by Chellappa et al [155] , who found that the activation
energy for the conversion is much higher than reported previously,
emphasizing that a rate expression that is first-order with respect
to  ammonia  provide  good  predictions  at  high  temperatures  and
pressures, with inhibition probably caused by the existing hydro-
gen in the reaction. Other materials such as ammonia-borane are
continuously presented as the closest option for delivery of hydro-
gen from ammonia decomposition to automotive power fuel cells
[156–159] . Various methods for decomposition of ammonia have
also been documented and patented to obtain pure hydrogen in-
fluxes for PEM fuel cells. These vary from micro-reactors consisting
of an array of alternative catalytic plate channels [160] , multi-stage
fixed bed membrane reactors (MSFBMR) [161] , micro-reformers ca-
pable of using conventional fuels for heat transfer improvement to
dissociate ammonia intro hydrogen [162] , etc. Light metal imides
(i.e. lithium imide, Li
2 NH) have also demonstrated their effective-
ness to decompose almost completely ammonia into hydrogen, en-
abling the development of prototypes that can operate at temper-
atures from 773 to 863 K, Fig. 18 [163] .

Unfortunately, ammonia residuals can have a detrimental effect
on PEM FCs, as the compound contaminates the membrane array,
inherently reducing efficiency [164,165] . As suggested by Uribe et
+ ), the product of ammonia with
al. [164] ammonium ions (NH
4
protons occupy charge sites in the PEM causing decrease of over-
all proton conductivity. Zhang et al. [165] proved that some of this
contamination can be reversed, although permanent damage is ob-
served on the membranes. Halseid et al. [166] showed that con-
centrations as low as 1 ppm of ammonia can significantly reduce
the efficiency of PEM FCs in a relatively short period of time. Thus,
although the technology is readily available with considerable po-
tential for small powering applications, care needs to be taken to
avoid contamination from un-decomposed ammonia, subject that
requires the study of further materials to increase resistance and
durability.

3.4. Combustion based technologies

3.4.1. Reciprocating engines

As previously depicted, ammonia can also be used as fuel for
internal  combustion  engines  (ICE)  and  for  compression  or  spark
ignition  units.  Similar  to  other  alternative  fuels  such  as  ethanol,
methanol, hydrogen and gasoline/diesel blends, the high octane of
ammonia ( ∼130) can improve combustion properties and reduce
undesirable  effects  such  as  knocking  [167] .  However,  it  must  be
recognised that due to the corrosive nature of ammonia, compo-
nents made out of brass or copper must be removed from the sys-
tem in order to avoid operability issues.

The  use  of  ammonia  as  vehicular  fuel  for  motorised  applica-
tions goes back as far as 1822 with a proposal from Sir Goldswor-
thy Gurney [69] where he developed an engine to drive a small
locomotive.  However,  it  was  not  until  1905  that  the  first  small
scale motor was developed by Ammonia Casale Ltd., who took out
patents in Italy in 1935 and 1936 [168] . As early as 1933, Norsk
Hydro operated an internal combustion engine vehicle on hydro-
gen produced from on-board reforming of ammonia [169] . Other
devices  followed  with  minor  success.  During  World  War  II  the
scarcity  of  fossil  fuels  in  some  regions  led  to  the  search  for  al-
ternative fuels for use in public transportation. The lack of diesel
in  Belgium  in  1942  led  to  the  consideration  of  first  compressed
coal gas, and then ammonia. Ammonia Casale was commissioned
to implement their new patent based on a process that employed
compressed gas and ammonia to replace diesel in the Belgian bus
service. The so-called Gazamo process, Fig. 19 , was implemented
in ∼100 vehicles and continued until diesel fuel became plentiful
again [168] .

In the 1960s, further developments ensued in the quest for al-
ternative fuels for  IC-Engines, driven by new environmental leg-
islations and early signs of the energy crisis which would impact
on Western  economies  the  following  decade.  Development  work
on spark ignition reciprocating engines, fuelled by ammonia, was
undertaken for military applications, as conventional engines had
been shown to perform poorly with pure ammonia. In order to im-
prove performance, propositions included increasing spark energy,
compression ratio, supercharging the engine and adding hydrogen
3 [170–172] . These develop-
into the fuel through dissociation of NH

ments showed that ammonia needed to be vaporised with at least
4–5% (by weight) H

2 for good performance.

Use of  IC engines also received considerable attention  during
this period [173–175] . Ammonia vapour and liquid ammonia were
studied in diesel and spark ignition engines respectively, at high
compression ratios. Although the tests at 30:1 compression ratio
using the spark ignition engine were unsuccessful, the results us-
ing ammonia vapour and diesel (for ignition purposes) generated
optimism for the success of using ammonia as fuel in IC engines.
Perhaps surprisingly, very little research and development was un-
dertaken during the 1970–80s in this field. The literature concern-
ing  development  of  ammonia  based  engines  is  very  sparse  dur-
ing this period, with the exception of the AMC GREMLIN at the
University of Tennessee in 1974 [176] . The field experienced a re-
vival in the 1990s, followed by a considerable increase in publica-
tions from 2004 onwards, with the first ammonia conference in the
USA.

Commercially, ammonia fuelled ICEs have attracted the atten-
tion  of  various  companies  and  countries  around  the  world  as  a
promising  technology  that  could  contribute  to  a  sustainable  fu-
ture. For example, Boothroyd [177] recently proposed the use of
ammonia  storage  from  stranded  energy  resources  in  rural  areas
to  power  large  scale  manufacture  near  cities  for  Australia.  Since
ammonia distribution is still conducted in Australia by trucks, it
has  been  proposed  to  replace  long  distance  trucks  by  a  fleet  of
ammonia-inflated  airships.  Similarly,  Leighty  [178]  proposed  the
use  of  stranded,  renewable  energy  sources  in  Alaska  to  produce
ammonia that can be used as fuel for ICE/Fuel Cells/GTs for on-
demand energy production and transportation.

Analyses  of  the  feasibility  of  ammonia  as  a  sustainable  fuel
in internal combustion engines based on thermodynamic perfor-
mance, system effectiveness, driving range, fuel tank compactness
and cost of driving have also been performed [10,11] . Not surpris-
ingly, the studies concluded that to make ammonia a viable fuel in
ICEs, ammonia needs to be mixed with other fuels as combustion
promoters due to ammonia’s low flame speed and high resistance
to auto-ignition. This was confirmed from previous studies where
a dual-fuel approach was usually chosen to implement ammonia
combustion in IC engines [179,180] . These works and others car-
ried by Liu et al. [181] showed that ammonia fuelled engines have

low power losses, no more corrosion and no more lubricant con-
sumption than conventional fuels.

Thus,  due  to  the  high  interest  in  developing  this  technology,
patents and commercially available units for transportation are un-
der  test  evaluation  for  commercial  release  in  the  near  future.  A
good reference to previous ammonia patents dating back to 1937
can be found in a patent submitted by Caterpillar Inc. in 2008 for
an  engine  fuelled  using  ammonia  [182] .  Specific  to  this  particu-
lar patent, ammonia has been used as primary fuel with electrical
supplements to the mechanical power to drive a new power sys-
tem capable of providing good combustion efficiency. The publica-
tion Ammonia Energy has recognised other stakeholders in the de-
velopment of ammonia fuelled engines, separating them into three
categories [183] :

1) Spark Ignition carbon based dual fuels, i.e. Biogas International
(Italy), the Savia Coalition (Italy), Green Transportation Technol-
ogy Group (South Korea), Xiamen University (China), etc.

2) Compression Ignition carbon based dual fuels such as Sturman
Industries (USA), Hydrofuel Inc (Canada) and Iowa State Univer-
sity (USA)

3) Hydrogen doped ammonia engines, i.e. Toyota (Japan), Siemens

(UK), etc.

3.4.1.1. Ammonia  blending  with  carbon  based  fuels.  As  previously
presented, doping ammonia with other fuels has been considered
one of the best solutions to improve ammonia combustion in ICEs.
It has been demonstrated [184,185] that high performance can be
achieved  using  ammonia/gasoline  fuelling,  a  three-way  catalytic
converter capable of cleaning emissions under stoichiometric and
rich conditions over short and long distances [186] . Replacement of
diesel with diesel/ammonia has also been attempted [187] show-
ing promising results with modification to current diesel engines.
Some of the results demonstrated that peak engine torque could be
achieved by using different combinations of diesel and ammonia,
with a monotonic CO
2  reduction for the same torque output for
3  increase. Additionally, lower NOx emissions were
systematic NH
measured for ammonia fuel mixes not exceeding 60% NH
3  [188] .
Combinations  such  as  gasoline/ammonia  and  ethanol/ammonia
[189] , ammonium nitrate/ammonia [190] and even pure oxygen us-
ing 100% ammonia [191] have been also attempted, showing that
these fuel mixtures can provide elevated power outputs under sta-
ble conditions, although mainly conditioned by the NOx emissions
product of the combustion process.

Direct gaseous ammonia injection has also been assessed in re-
cent studies by Ryu [192] who showed a high correlation between
the timing and duration of the injection of ammonia in a spark-

ignition-engine. It was noted that the injection timing should be
in the range of 320 to 370 BTDC for gasoline-ammonia fuel mixes.
3 , the engine efficien-
Due to slow flame-speed propagation of NH
cies were observed to be lower than the baseline performance. Fi-
nally,  it  was  found  that  the  emissions  were  slightly  reduced  for
some species, i.e. carbon monoxide, though accompanied with an
increase in NOx and NH
3 , as expected. Similar work has focused on
blends of ammonia with commercially available emulsifiers such
as ethanol or methanol that can enhance solubility of the blend
[193] .  Results  proved  that  pure,  liquid  phase  gasoline  is  capable
of dissolving only 4.5% (vol) of ammonia at 345 kPa and 286.65 K,
while the use of 10%(vol) of ethanol or methanol increased the sol-
ubility of ammonia to 11% (vol). Further studies showed that gaso-
line  with  30%  ethanol  or  methanol  can  retain  up  to  17.35%(vol)
ammonia  [194] .  At  higher  engine  speeds,  better  engine  perfor-
mances in terms of increased torque and power output were ob-
served for ammonia rich fuels compared to those for pure gaso-
line fuels. Thus, it was concluded that hydrogen can be stored as
an ammonia-gasoline fuel blend and successfully recovered with-
out major modification to the existing infrastructure of the engine
[195] .

One of the most interesting new concepts for ammonia fuelled
engine technology is the AmVeh, Fig. 20 , developed by the Korean
Institute for Energy Research (KIER), which is to convert existing
vehicle fleets into 70% NH
3 -30% gasoline vehicles [196] . The de-
velopers  have  converted  an  LPG-gasoline  unit  by  adding  a  con-
trol system and removing the corrodible, copper containing met-
als - specifically the so-called ‘yellow metal’ high zinc brass. If the
system was installed across 20% of the current Korean fleets, the
country could reduce CO
2  emissions by 10 million tons annually,
thus aiding their future targets on climate change mitigation.

Numerical simulations of co-fuelling reciprocating engines with
ammonia have also been conducted to determine best operating
conditions  of  industrial  and  transportation  engines.  Zhong  et  al.
[197] used CFD analyses to model compression ratios, air inlet tem-
peratures and air/fuel ratios using ammonia with n-heptane. The
results demonstrated that compression ratios of 16:1 and inlet air
temperatures of 800 K allow ignition of ammonia blends through
compression. Moreover, it was shown that as n-heptane increases,
the  ignition  temperature  required  reduces  from  800  to  360 K.  A
very comprehensive compilation of data has been gathered by Din-
cer  et  al.  [198]  with  regards  to  co-fuelling  ammonia  blends  for
diesel locomotives using integrated heat recovery, hydrogen pro-
duction and emission reduction subsystems. Economic considera-
tions such as carbon-tax rates and fuel costs were considered. Fur-
ther work has compared a conventional diesel-electric locomotive
through energy and exergy efficiency, fuel consumption and envi-

As for all combustion systems, emissions from ammonia com-
bustion play a crucial role in deployment; thus dedicated research
has  focussed  in  this  area.  Further  investigations  [201]  depicted
gasoline–ammonia combustion in a spark-ignition engine in terms
of the combustion characteristics and exhaust emissions with di-
rect injection. CO emissions were found to decrease but emissions
of  NO x  and  hydrocarbons  were  increased  with  ammonia,  as  ex-
pected due to the high nitrogen content of the ammonia molecule.
Notwithstanding  the  emissions  challenges,  however,  direct  injec-
tion of gaseous ammonia with carbonaceous fuels was proven to
be feasible in engine combustion.

3.4.1.2. Ammonia and hydrogen.  Of particular interest is the use of
hydrogen in the ammonia blends, as the molecule can be recov-
ered through splitting of ammonia, with the previously stated im-
provements in combustion performance. Studies show that ammo-
nia can be blended with hydrogen at levels as low as 5% H
2 [202] ,
still providing good power response. Higher doping ratios have also
been deployed [203] , showing, for example, that 10% hydrogen ad-
dition  provided  optimum  efficiency  and  effective  power,  Fig.  22 .
High NOx emissions were present under lean conditions, thus sug-
gesting the need for selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of exhaust
gases under these conditions.

Further  studies  of  reciprocating  engines  have  also  been  ex-
tended to more commercial applications in Italy, where implemen-
tation of ammonia ICE technology has been performed by DESTEC
in  Pisa  [204,205] ,  showing  good  results  for  the  conversion  of  a
Lombardi 505 cm 3 gasoline engine into a hydrogen/ammonia sys-
tem for waste collection buses. Liquid ammonia contains 1.7 times
as  much  hydrogen  as  liquid  hydrogen  itself  [206] .  Thus,  studies
performed  by  Koike  et  al  demonstrated  that  an  ammonia  tank
(1 MPa) contains 2.5 times as much energy as a hydrogen tank (at
70 MPa)  by  volume,  i.e.  a  hydrogen  tank  of  770 L  (350 kg)  could
be replaced by an ammonia tank of 315 L (172 kg). Further anal-
yses on storage capacity systems demonstrated the superior per-
formance of ammonia storage capacity for transportation purposes
[167] , Table 5 . Consequently, the smaller tanks required for liquid
ammonia were presented as a commercial opportunity for the lo-
cal Region of Tuscany [204] .

The  only  mechanical  modification  to  the  engine  required  the
addition of electro-injectors for hydrogen and ammonia to the in-

ronmental impacts. Results showed that a blend with 50% of fuel
energy  supplied  by  ammonia  can  improve  heat  recovery  with  a
slight increase in energy and exergy efficiencies. Moreover, there
is a considerable reduction of greenhouse gases of up to 53% with
pollutant  production  (NOx,  CO,  particulate  matter,  hydrocarbons)
below the standards required by 2012–2014 [35] .

Dimethyl  ether  (DME)  fuels  were  also  assessed  using  liquid
ammonia–DME mixtures in a compression-ignition engine with a
direct-injection  strategy.  The  cost  analysis  showed  a  comparable
fuel energy cost to diesel fuel with ammonia/DME, although the
inclusion of ammonia in the fuel mixture was shown to increase
CO,  HC  and  NO x  emissions,  with  lower  power  outputs,  Fig.  21
[199] . Although injection strategies were developed to enable the
use of ammonia-DME in direct-injection compression-ignition en-
gines [200] , the corresponding engine performance was also linked
to increased CO, HC and NO x emissions, thus suggesting that post-
exhaust treatment would be required for these systems.

take manifold [207] . One of the main features of these devices was
the development of a new patented device capable of cracking am-
monia into hydrogen and nitrogen at the concentration required
for the engine [206] . The experimental results confirmed the need
to  dope  the  ammonia  blend  with  hydrogen  and  that  observed
brake power was less than that for gasoline as a consequence of
the  poor  heating  value  of  the  mixture.  The  maximum  observed
NOx emission was 0.003 g/kJ at half load and 4500 rpm, without
catalytic reduction [207] . Similar thermal ammonia reformers have
been also evaluated by other research groups to obtain hydrogen
to increase the reactivity of an ammonia fuel blend [167] , showing
that a 40% hydrogen fraction improves combustion properties close
to those observed for gasoline.

Recent studies [208] evaluate the implementation of hybrid sys-
tems. Developments show two systems using ammonia-hydrogen
fuel for either an internal combustion engine or a combination of
an ICE with PEM fuel cells to power a vehicle, Fig. 23 . The study
was  performed  with  and  without  dissociation  of  ammonia.  The
results  from  the  theoretical  study  show  that  the  amount  of  ex-
ergy that is recovered using ammonia dissociation (i.e. hydrogen)
are considerable, i.e. 16.4% and 13.1% for the ICE and the ICE-PEM
systems respectively, consequence of the added hydrogen coming
from the dissociation unit. Thus, the use of hydrogen from cracked
ammonia  is  highly  beneficial  when  compared  to  pure  ammonia
injection.  It  must  be  emphasized  that  integration  of  heat  recov-
ery for dissociation units played an important role in improving
these  systems,  concept  that  can  be  expanded  to  other  combus-
tion  technologies  to  increase  efficiency  while  minimizing  exergy
destruction.

Regarding emissions, research groups have investigated mecha-
nisms governing the nitrogen based emissions in a NH
2 fuelled
SI-engine  [209] .  Applications  with  flue  gases  exhaust  treatment
showed lower levels than legally required when a SCR catalyst was
used to eliminate all NO x emissions. Gill et al. [210] compared the

3 was found to have lower exhaust NH

compression-ignition engine. The study showed that pure NH
3 per-
3 at high load in terms of engine
formed better than dissociated NH
stability and brake thermal efficiency -possibly a consequence of
increased heat loss from the combustion chamber, changes to com-
bustion characteristics and changes to the efficiency of H
2 combus-
tion under different loads and concentrations-, while at low loads
the fuels behaved similarly, although it should be noted that using
dissociated NH

and significantly low N
2 O formation compared to un-dissociated
NH
3 addition. Other advanced technologies such as Homogeneous
Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) have also been used to deter-
mine their impact on the performance and reduction of emissions
while using hydrogen-ammonia blends [211] . Trials were expanded
to the use of Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) which showed a con-
siderable decrease of NOx consequence of reduced oxygen avail-
able for combustion. However, it was also recognised that the pro-
duction of N
2 O increases at low temperatures, thus suggesting that
operation  using  HCCI  fuelled  with  ammonia-hydrogen  blends  is
feasible and low polluting as long as combustion temperatures are
above 1400 K while using EGR for NOx mitigation.

In terms of emissions, all modern combustion vehicles are now
required to operate SCR catalyst systems and/or fuel additive sys-
tems to reduce nitrogen oxides to N
2 gas. Interestingly, these sys-
tems work through the addition of chemicals that decompose to
ammonia, and ammonia then reduces the NOx within the gas flow
according to the following equations;
4NO ( g ) +4N H 3 ( g ) + O 2 ( g ) → 4 N 2 ( g ) +6 H 2 O ( l )

(2)

2N O 2 ( g ) +4N H 3 ( g ) + O 2 ( g ) → 3 N 2 ( g ) +6 H 2 O ( l )

N O 2 ( g ) +NO ( g ) +2N H 3 ( g ) → 2 N 2 ( g ) +3 H 2 O ( l )

Therefore,  NOx  emissions  from  ammonia  fuelled  combustion
devices may be mitigated in a similar fashion. However, it should
be noted that for devices fuelled by ammonia a ready reservoir of

ammonia for NOx reduction will exist and therefore it may be pos-
sible to design ammonia fuelled systems that do not require sec-
ondary exhaust clean-up or high cost catalyst systems to achieve
emission free exhaust. Furthermore, ammonia combustion is often
improved through preheating or partial decomposition of the am-
monia prior to combustion and it may be possible to parasitically
use the waste heat from exhaust systems to pre-heat or decom-
pose ammonia while simultaneously removing NOx pollutants.

In summary, clearly further research developing internal com-
bustion  technologies  fuelled  by  ammonia  is  necessary.  There  is
now increasing interest in these systems and considerable compe-
tition to produce the first commercially viable devices. However,
as described previously, the challenge of reducing further NOx and
unburned ammonia remains at the heart of this research and tech-
nological field.

3.4.2. Gas turbines

The gas turbine is another power-generating device which of-
fers the potential benefits through ammonia fuelling described ear-
lier. Hence, a gas-turbine combustor that burns a combination of
NH
3  and  other  fuels  with  controlled  emissions  and  combustion
characteristics is highly desirable. Studies that have contributed to
improving understanding of ammonia fuel blends for gas turbine
power generation are summarised in this section. It is noted that
this is an immature field, with relatively few publications concern-
ing the development of ammonia gas turbines.

Early research on the development of ammonia fuelled gas tur-
bine combustion systems was undertaken during the 1960’s [212–

214] . Those studies demonstrated that ammonia’s ignition energy
was considerably higher compared to fossil fuels due to the low
reactivity of ammonia. Moreover, at stoichiometric conditions, the
quenching distance for ammonia-air (6.7 mm) was 3.5 greater than
for propane, with ammonia burning at narrower equivalence ra-
tio ranges [213] . However, it was also found that dissociation of
ammonia  could  produce  faster  flames,  which  could  attain  simi-
lar properties to some common hydrocarbons. Thus, it was con-
cluded that 28% dissociated NH
3 could be used as a substitute fuel
in  gas  turbine  combustion  systems  sized  for  hydrocarbon  fuels.
Further experiments demonstrated that the fundamental problem
with ammonia-air as a turbine fuel is the relatively slow chemical
reaction rate, giving a laminar burning velocity of ∼0.06–0.08 m/s
[215] .  As  air  flow  is  reduced  to  allow  sufficient  residence  time
for the reaction to progress, diminished Reynolds number effects
lead to reduced turbulence and hence less effective mixing, which
in turn decreases combustion efficiency [214] . Other studies have
been conducted to demonstrate the concept of using ammonia as
an engine fuel, with success in terms of power production that un-
fortunately fell short in terms of emissions performance for NOx
[216,217] .

In the 1960’s, Solar and UC Berkeley investigated a 250HP T-
350 (Technical Report DA-44-009-AMC-824(T)) single can ammo-
nia burner turbine [46] . Performance of the engine using vapour
NH
3 was found to be similar to JP-4. Initially, using ammonia in-
jection at 2.35 times that of hydrocarbons provided cooler turbine
inlet  temperatures  at  similar  power  conditions.  However,  when
turbine  inlet  temperatures  were  matched  to  those  of  hydrocar-

bons,  ammonia  provided  10–20%  increase  power  with  high  effi-
ciencies.  In  1991,  the  Italian  power  generator  ENEL  undertook  a
research  program  that  included  ammonia  for  power  generation.
Their  conclusions  led  to  positive  power  production  performance
that was compromised by the high emission of NOx [218] . Grcar
et al. [219] combined experimental and modelling investigations of
ammonia chemistry in a hot combustion environment below adia-
batic flame temperatures. The final products of NH
3 oxidation re-
mained sensitive to mixing even at temperatures below those of
self-sustaining flames. At these low temperatures, NH
3  oxidation
occurred in a premixed reaction zone, as sufficiently high temper-
atures  led  to  the  development  of  a  non-premixed  reaction  zone
that produces significantly less NO than the equivalent premixed
system developed, effect potentially caused by the recombination
of ammonia with NOx products and the absence of OH radicals es-
sential for the production of emissions.

More  recently,  a  number  of  different  approaches  have  been
pursued to use ammonia as a flexible fuel in gas turbines, with
most  of  them  finding  that  emissions  are  the  main  limitation  of
such  technologies  [220] .  SPG  Advanced  Propulsion  and  Energy
[46,220] is one of the few companies claiming to be close to devel-
opment of commercial systems, Fig. 24 . They have presented series
of papers that have summarised the main challenges for the devel-
opment of a reliable technology. These are: a) Lower flame temper-
atures and slower kinetics of NH
3 ; b) unstable combustion; c) re-
liable ammonia vaporization to improve efficiency; d) pre-cracking
of the molecule required to increase flame speed and burning ra-
tios.

Swirl stabilised combustion of ammonia with other molecules
has briefly been analysed at the University of Iowa by Meyer et al.
[221] in a 40 kW burner, with nozzles, swirl stabilisers and a self-
sustained heat exchanger. Stabilisation was achieved using differ-
ent swirlers with different concentrations of ammonia, hydrogen
and methane. For those experiments where ammonia and hydro-
gen were mixed, it was found that the use of a flame holder in-
creased the combustion efficiency, with a demonstrable reduction
in NO
X emissions, possibly as a consequence of recombination of
species (NOx and unburned ammonia).

The  Fukishima  Renewable  Energy  Institute  (FREA),  has  devel-
oped fuel flexible platforms to burn liquid NH
3 produced from re-
newable sources, i.e. wind and solar, in combination with kerosene
in  a  50 kW  micro-gas  turbine,  Fig.  25 .  Diffusion  combustion  has
been  employed  in  the  prototype  by-fuel  combustor  due  to  its
flame  stability  and  it  has  been  demonstrated  that  the  equip-
ment  can  be  run  using  ammonia-kerosene  blends  at  different
concentrations.

The gas turbine was started with kerosene that was replaced
by ammonia and an output power of 17 and 21 kW was achieved
with  38%  and  30%  replacement  of  kerosene  by  supplying  NH
3 ,
respectively. However, the production of NO
X  increased consider-
ably  based  on  the  amount  of  ammonia  injected,  reaching  levels
up to 600 ppmV. The NOx emissions challenge for ammonia fu-
elled  turbines  has  been  investigated  since  the  first  development
of the technology. Currently, the best solution is the use of selec-
tive catalytic converters (SCR) to reduce the emissions produced
by a micro-gas turbine up to levels of 10 ppmV [222–224] . Fur-
ther works on this system have been performed using other blends
such as ammonia-methane blends, and the implementation of rich-
lean combustion systems for NOx reduction has also been demon-
strated with good performance and the reduction of emissions to
half of those measured without this combustion technique [225] .
Other findings [226] show that additions of hydrogen can improve
flame stability and mitigate even further NOx production, encour-
aging the use of ammonia for power generation at low nitrogen
oxide concentrations.

Other potential beneficiaries of the research undertaken include
the  steel industry  where ammonia is available as  a waste prod-
uct which could be considered as fuel to be used in co-fired low-
pressure  furnaces,  for  example.  Co-firing  could  be  achieved  us-
ing  ammonia  and  methane/hydrogen  to  support  power  produc-
tion of high energy intensive industries. With that aim, groups at
Cardiff University (UK) and Tohoku (Japan) are currently investigat-
ing the development of new gas turbine combustion systems ca-
pable of providing large power quantities with low emission rates.
The work at Tohoku has determined the exhaust gas compositions
of a particular burner under atmospheric pressure and fuel lean
conditions. It has been demonstrated that as the equivalence ratio
increases towards stoichiometry, unburnt species such as NH
3 , CO
and total hydrocarbons decrease in contrast to NO x  and that the
burner achieves combustion efficiencies above 97% for ammonia-
mixing-ratios  below  50%.  It  has  been  reported  that  it  was  diffi-
cult to achieve low emissions and high combustion efficiency in a
single-stage combustor, and hence a two-stage combustion system
has been conceptualised and demonstrated, with studies suggest-
ing lower NOx and unburnt gas species emissions while maintain-
ing high combustion efficiencies [227] .

Valera-Medina et al. [228,229] presented a series of studies us-
ing  a  generic  swirl  burner  that  was  fuelled  using  ammonia  and
hydrogen/methane at different concentrations. The results showed
the  complexity  in  stabilizing  premixed  ammonia  blends,  identi-
fying  a  particular  pattern  of  oxygen  consumption  that  was  fol-
lowed  by  flame  speed  reduction,  retarding  the  combustion  pro-

cess and eventually pushing the flame back into the combustion
chamber with an inherent aeration. Also, it was recognised that the
use of hydrogen injection required a new injection strategy to en-
sure stable combustion, as premixing eventually led to early flash-
back.  NOx  and  CO  were  considerably  lower  at  high  equivalence
ratios > 1.10, depicting a region of chemically reactive balance be-
tween methane/hydrogen and ammonia combustion, with recom-
bination of NOx emissions with unburned ammonia, increasing OH
radicals, Fig. 26 , topic that is still under debate across the scientific
community.

Xiao  et  al.  [230]  have  also  produced  data  to  determine
the potential of using ammonia/methane and ammonia/hydrogen
[231] blends for power generation. Results showed that the use of
ammonia at high pressures as those found in industrial devices can
mitigate the production of NOx by increasing the recombination of
species and compacting the flame front. Moreover, there seems to
be a trend in terms of the production of OH radicals at high equiv-
alence ratios, denoting the recombination of emissions with NH
2
radicals in the post-flame zone, leading to the formation of nitro-
gen molecules, suggesting scenarios where ammonia gas turbines
can become a feasible, reliable and environmental possibility.

Companies  such  as  NUON  have  also  started  ambitious  pro-
grams to develop their capabilities in terms of ammonia fired sys-
tems.  The  most  notable  is  the  “Power-to-Ammonia” program  in
which NUON collaborates with TU Delft, Proton Ventures, OCI Ni-
trogen,  AkzoNobel,  ISPT  and  the  University  of  Twente  [232,233] .
The  NUON  project  perceives  ammonia  as  a  “superbattery” that
stores  excess  renewable  power  at  large  scale  over  long  periods.

The new Magnum-plant in Eemshaven, officially opened in 2013,
is proposed to be converted into a green ammonia fuelled facility
2 emissions considerably
instead of a coal plant, thus reducing CO
[234,235] . Similarly, multinational companies such as Siemens have
established R&D roadmaps to position green ammonia and hydro-
gen produced from renewables as energy vectors of the future, us-
ing the chemical in either transport, processes or large power gen-
eration, Fig. 27 .

It  has  recently  been  announced  [236]  that  Chugoku  Electric
Power Company has conducted a series of trials at its Mizushima
power  plant  in  July  2017,  where  ammonia  was  added  to  the
155 MW coal-fired plant at a rate of 450 kg/hr. The company con-
firmed that the addition of the ammonia did not cause the plant’s
power  efficiency  to  reduce.  On  the  basis  of  energy  content,  the
ammonia added represented 0.6–0.8% of total fuel. At this ratio, a
decrease in carbon dioxide emissions was observed. The Chugoku
demonstration has been the first where ammonia has been burned
in a commercial power plant in Japan.

Research into the use of ammonia for large power generation in
support of decarbonising high carbon-producing processes is still
ongoing. Of particular interest are the ill-defined kinetic processes
that occur at high power outputs using various blends of ammo-
nia with gases such as methane and hydrogen. More specifically,
at equivalence ratios between 1.05 to 1.25 an increase in reactiv-
ity and overproduction of OH species has been observed, suggest-
ing recombination of molecules that require further understanding
and research to reduce the time to deployment of ammonia power
generation at a commercial scale.

3.4.3. Propulsion

Pioneering studies were undertaken during the middle of the
20th century by NASA, who identified through their XLR-99 pro-
gram the need for “combustor enhancers”, i.e. hydrogen, kerosene,
fossil fuels, etc. during start-up and idle for their propulsion en-
gine [190] . According to some documents and “in field” research
[176] ,  Reaction  Motors,  the  company  that  took  over  the  XLR-99
program, decided to use ammonia on their Viking engine (XLR-10).
The rationale behind the use of ammonia and liquid oxygen (LOX)
was the need for a stable fuel with good volumetric energy den-
sity, easy to store, working in the required temperature range, with
cooling properties and also potential for hydrogen engine develop-
ment. However, due to the lack of motivation and no clear under-
standing of the need for using ammonia and the need for gravi-
metric energy density based fuels, the programme stopped. During
the period that the project ran, the X-15 aircraft was developed.
The aircraft, a powerful device commissioned by NASA, set unoffi-
cial world records in speed and altitude [176] .

Thomas  [237]  and  Thomas  et  al.  [238]  discussed  the  use  of
methane-ammonia-oxygen  blends  in  terms  of  their  potential  to
allow  deflagration  to  detonation  transition  in  small  piping  lines,
a  technique  that  can  be  used  for  propulsion  applications.  Com-
positional  ranges  were  obtained  by  varying  the  oxygen  content
whilst maintaining methane/ammonia ratios of 1.00:1.18. The re-
sults  showed  that  flame  speeds  were  modest  for  all  mixtures
where  the  oxygen  percentage  was  39%  or  less.  Similarly,  violent
pressure transients were not observed for mixtures with less than
40% oxygen. Beyond these values, violent and sometimes detonat-
ing transitions were observed for the cases analysed, especially for
initial pressures above ambient.

Micro-thrusters fuelled with ammonia, a revolutionary concept
for  propulsion  of  small  space  vehicles,  has  also  received  some
interest  especially  in  Russia,  China  and  the  USA.  Blinov  et  al.
[239,240] presented some work in terms of the design features and
performance of ammonia electrothermal micro-thrusters, showing
that they can become a competitive, cost effective option due to
their specific impulse increase ∼20%. Fatuev et al. [241] have also
presented  work  on  the  development  of  ACETAM,  a  rocket  fuel
based on the fluidization of gaseous acetylene by a highly concen-
trated dilution in liquefied ammonia. The characteristics of the fuel
show improvement and higher stability when compared to other

blends  at  various  operating  pressures,  nozzle  expansion  degrees
and efficiency through various stages during space launching.

Chinese groups have also studied the thermodynamic proper-
ties  and  potential  of  propellants  using  acetylene  and  ammonia
[242] . Various concentrations of acetylene-ammonia with LOX and
other fuels such as rocket kerosene and methane were evaluated
thermodynamically. The results indicated that a 25% acetylene con-
tent was the best in terms of specific impulse and security, with
properties that were superior to LOX with rocket kerosene.

Some published work can also be found for the development
‘of ammonia micro-resisto-jets (MRJ) for micro-satellites by Busek
Co. Inc. Robin et al. [243] evaluated the use of ammonia MRJs to
cope with weight and complexity constraints whilst creating a high
thrust/power system. Laboratory experiments showed exit temper-
atures of 573–1448 K, with trust levels of 5–12 mN with specific
impulses  as  high  as  210 s.  These  ammonia  micro-resistojet  pro-
vided up to 25 W nominal power level. Due to the small nature
of the system and its innovative design using platinum tubes, the
total device weight is about 15 gm. A successful 100 h Engineering
Model (EM) was carried out, leading to further plans for develop-
ment.

Although the technology is promising, literature on this topic is
still scarce, opening the possibilities for further research for micro-
satellites and other micro-propulsion systems using ammonia.

3.5. Combustion fundamentals of ammonia flames

As presented, ammonia is a potential fuel that could be used
for cooling, transportation and storage of integrated systems based
on combustion processes, thus delivering significant power for in-
dustrial applications.

3.5.1. Ammonia characteristics

As discussed, ammonia still faces a long way before being en-
tirely recognised as a fuel for power applications. Although tech-
nical barriers are overcome by continuous, high quality research
combined with advanced innovation, i.e. as the ones presented in
previous  sections,  one  of  the  main  reasons  of  this  trend  is  the
fierce  competition  between  ammonia  and  other  fuels.  As  stated,
ammonia should not be regarded as a competitor to the hydrogen
economy, but as an enabler. Therefore, ammonia can find its niche

of application amongst some other fuels that are currently under
research. In order to recognise these applications, it is necessary
to know some specific characteristics of ammonia to allow com-
parison with other hydrogen sources employed in power systems.
Out of the vast range of alternatives, methanol and pure hydrogen
were selected for this review, Table 6 . Methane is also mentioned
as baseline.

It is clear that pure ammonia shows both low specific energy
and laminar burning velocities combined with high auto-ignition
temperatures and elevated ignition energies, making it more diffi-
cult to burn in its pure form. As a consequence, blends with hy-
drogen, i.e. which can be obtained relatively easy from cracking of
the ammonia molecule, have been mostly attempted in more prac-
tical applications. Moreover, the use of ammonia with gases such
as methane, i.e. that shares similar density, viscosity and heat ca-
pacity, makes relatively easy its implementation in co-firing appli-
cations. Thus, ammonia has considerable potential to compete with
other hydrogen-carrier fuels. However, before ammonia can be im-
plemented in power devices, further understanding of its combus-
tion behaviour is required, mainly by further research that not only
demonstrates the concept but also details the chemistry of burning
ammonia for enhancement and control of such a process.

3.5.2. Reaction models for ammonia

To develop combustion-based technologies for ammonia utilisa-
tion, it is essential to have a deep understanding of the detailed
chemical  process  through  the  ammonia  combustion  phenomena.
Therefore, research has been dedicated to understand the funda-
mental characteristics of ammonia and the detailed reactions that
occur throughout the combustion process.

As  early  as  1960s,  studies  [254,255]  were  performed  to  un-
derstand  the  chemical  reactions  of  flames  containing  ammonia.
A  wide  range  of  compositions  and  conditions  were  investigated
to gain more insight into the kinetics of ammonia-fuelled flames
[256–258] .  The  first  complete  description  of  a  detailed  chemical
mechanism  for  ammonia  oxidation  was  proposed  by  Miller  and
Bowman  [259]  based  on  the  ammonia  combustion  experiments.
Comparison between the theoretical kinetic model and experimen-
tal  data  showed  good  performance  of  the  Miller  mechanism  for
ammonia  combustion  over  a  range  of  temperatures,  equivalence
ratios and pressures, with especial emphasis on the performance
of the NOx chemistry. Actually, mechanisms for NOx formation and
removal processes are carefully considered in this study, of which
important  elementary  reactions  and  their  coefficients  were  pro-
vided. The results enabled analyses that demonstrated that NO/N
2
production is mainly dependant on the fate of NHx radicals, which
are  oxidised  to  form  NO  through  the  nitroxyl  (HNO)  molecule.
Miller’s mechanism has been correlated to a wide range of con-
ditions  in  several  ammonia  combustion  studies  across  the  years
[260–262] .

Based  on  the  Miller’s  [259]  mechanism,  Lindstedt  et  al.
[263] developed a chemical kinetic mechanism model for ammo-

nia oxidation in a wide range of flat laminar flames. Important ele-
mentary reactions were recognised for NO formation processes for
pure ammonia and its blends doped with hydrogen. It was found
that  the  Zeldovich  mechanism  is  responsible  for  the  NO  forma-
tion and conversion under greater fuel concentrations of ammo-
nia/hydrogen flames while the reaction NH + OH plays a more sig-
nificant role in NO formation when using pure ammonia.

Skreiberg  et  al.  [264]  established  a  detailed  chemical  kinetic
model  for  ammonia  oxidation  in  the  presence  of  hydrogen,  car-
bon  monoxide,  and  methane.  The  H/N/O  submechanism  draws
primarily  on  Miller’s  work  on  ammonia  flames.  In  this  mecha-
nism,  several  reactions  were  characterized  more  accurately  and
the  mechanism  model  satisfactorily  predicts  flow  reactor  mea-
surements data. The results are summarised for low temperatures
which  will  promote  the  reaction  path  NH
2 ,  whilst
2 → NH → N is important at higher temperatures. Lind-
NH
stedt’s model has also been employed in several ammonia com-
bustion studies [261,265,266] .

3 → NH

Among the detailed mechanisms proposed for ammonia com-
bustion, Konnov’s kinetics model [267] has been widely used and
verified for ammonia combustion studies, proving a better perfor-
mance on the prediction of NOx emission and propagation among
many  other  mechanisms  available  [266,268–271] .  This  detailed
chemical  kinetics  mechanism  [272]  was  originally developed  for
the combustion of small hydrocarbon fuels considering the pres-
ence of ammonia. The mechanism model has been updated contin-
uously and in the latest version the model was greatly improved
compared to previous versions, with particular attention paid to
the upgrading of the H/N/O sub-mechanism in the development of
the model. Specifically, with the improved implementation of the
NCN  pathway,  a  more  accurate  calculation  of  NO  formation  and
NCN radicals in the flame were obtained. It has been tested against
experimental data available for oxidation, ignition, and flame struc-
tures in mixtures of nitrogen-containing species, hydrogen, carbon
monoxide and hydrocarbons.

Duynslaegher  et  al.  [268]  found  in  her  stabilised  flame  ex-

Konnov mechanism would overestimate the mole fraction profiles
of  radical  NH

The  Tian  mechanism  [274]  was  then  developed  based  on

determined  in  11  premixed  flames  of  different  mole  ratios  of

with temperatures ranging from 973 to 1773 K. The reactor in the
experiments was operated under atmospheric pressure conditions
and stoichiometries between 0.13 and 0.55 equivalence ratios. The
kinetic mechanism model is based on the Tian mechanism describ-
ing  CH
3  oxidation,  especially  extending  hydrocarbon/amine
interaction  subsets.  Through  pathway  analyses  it  was  identified
that the formation of NO is mostly related to HNO which is primar-
2 + O. This detailed chemical mechanism also
ily sourced from NH
successfully captured experimental trends for the effects of high
CO

2 concentration.
Mathieu  and  Petersen  [277]  studied  the  oxidation  of  ammo-
nia  under  high  temperatures  (1560–2455 K)  and  high  pressures
(around 0.14, 1.1, and 3.0 MPa) conditions. A detailed mechanism
model was established for ammonia oxidation from shock tube ex-
periments.  The  mechanism  also  provided  a  state-of-the-art  NOx
sub-mechanism which can be used for a wide range of conditions.
The established chemical mechanism has proved accurate in pre-
dicting ignition delay times of ammonia oxidation under elevated
conditions,  which  are  more  relevant  to  many  industrial  applica-
tions.

There are some other detailed chemical mechanisms, which are
originally  developed  for  hydrocarbon  fuels,  also  potentially  able
to be used in ammonia combustion studies. For instance, the fa-
mous  GRI  Mech  3.0  mechanism  [278]  is  extensively  employed
for  combustion  of  natural  gas,  which  includes  the  formation  of
NOx and reburn chemistry. GRI-Mech 3.0 mechanism is also used
3  oxidation  in  some  literature  [266,269,279] ,
as  reference  for  NH
since  ammonia-doped  methane/air  flames  using  this  mechanism
have also been studied in the past with satisfactory results [280] .
Other  mechanisms  such  as   ̊Abo  Akademi  (  ̊AA)  kinetic  reaction
scheme  [281]  were  created  for  specific  conditions.  Particular  for
 ̊AA,  the  mechanism  was  developed  for  combustion  of  biomass-
derived gases under moderate temperature, being validated in the
flameless ammonia chemistry study of [282] .

Nozari  and  Karabeyoglu  [283]  developed  a  reduced  chemical
mechanism for the combustion of ammonia/hydrogen based on the
Konnov mechanism, which aims to expedite the design of future
ammonia combustors. Li et al. [284] numerically analysed the en-
hancement of hydrogen addition in ammonia-fuelled blends, with
emphasis on flame speed and ignition. Reactions of O + H
2 = OH + H,
H + O
2 O + H  were  identified  as  playing
2 + OH = H
the most important role in the increased reactivity of the blend.
At  high temperature, these findings suggest that  blow-off limits,
the  concentration  of  radicals  H,  OH  and  O  and  the  maximum
flame  temperature  are  enhanced  with  H
2  substitution  in  bench-
3 /air flames, demonstrating that hydrogen doping could

and positive changes in Markstein length.

Xiao et al. [231] studied ammonia/hydrogen blends with various
kinetic models, suggesting that all these mechanism present con-
siderable variance between experimental results at various condi-
tions, Fig. 28 . This was expected as most of the models are de-
veloped  for  specific  equivalence  ratios,  mixtures,  pressures,  etc.
However,  it  is  found  with  great  interest  that  does  not  exist  yet
a  reaction  model  capable  of  capturing  accurately  the  great  va-
riety  of  conditions  at  which  ammonia  can  be  burned.  There  is
still considerable progress to be made before a generalised model
can be proposed and implemented, particularly at specific condi-
tions where low NOx are measured. Currently, each condition will
present different degrees of reaction, making critical the develop-
ment of mechanisms for specific conditions and fuel blends.

Therefore, there is still much debate on these phenomena and
their impact on both the flame and the combustion process when
using NH
3 . For example, the work done by Okafor et al. [285] en-
abled  the  development  of  a  more  accurate  reaction  model  for
studies of ammonia-methane flames under atmospheric conditions
using  a  combination  of  laminar  burning  studies  and  advanced
ammonia  kinetic  models.  The  GRI-Mech  3.0  and  Tian’s  models
were  utilised  to  develop  a  detailed  reaction  mechanism  suitable
for ammonia-methane combustion, finding that Tian’s model un-
derestimates the un-stretched laminar burning velocity owing to
the  dominance  of  HCO( + H,  OH,  O
2 )  over
HCO → CO + H.  This  is  in  accord  to  recent  studies  carried  out  by
Xiao  et  al.  [286] ,  who  through  studies  of  ignition  delay,  flame
speed and emissions suggests that Tian’s model was better suited
for analyses of ammonia-methane blends, although there is still a
need for improvement.

Hence, there is still considerable debate on the parameters re-
quired for development of a most appropriate model for ammonia
combustion analyses, problem that has been largely solved by se-
lecting models based on their accuracy at the particular conditions
at which they have shown superior performance compared to the
rest. This problem has paved the path for current research on the
topic, with groups across the globe trying to determine the best
model that fits all the different flame and combustion variables.

3.5.3. Fundamental studies of flame characteristics

Many parameters influence the flame characteristics. For exam-
ple, laminar burning velocity is an important combustion property
defined  based  on  an  adiabatic  planar  un-stretched  flame,  and  is
required for characterisation of phenomena such as flame stability
and validation of reaction models. Flame speed, a combination of

the burning rate and density ratio, is also an important parameter
in understanding the fundamentals of a particular flame. Similarly,
the  Markstein  length,  another  important  combustion  parameter,
expresses the sensitivity of the laminar burning velocity to flame
stretch rate due to themo-diffusive effects [287] . Of course equiv-
alence and compression ratios, ignition delay time, radical forma-
tion, etc. have an important impact on the adiabatic flame. These
and some other parameters are essential to understand the com-
bustion process of a particular fuel.

There are already plenty of work performed on the propagation
property of ammonia-based fuels. Takizawa et al. [288] measured
3 /air mixtures of different stoichiometry by
the flame speed for NH
the spherical vessel method under atmospheric conditions, obtain-
ing a maximum value of 0.072 m/s at equivalence ratio of 1.10. Lee
et al. [261] tested laminar premixed hydrogen-added ammonia/air
flames to determine flame speed and NOx and N
2 O emissions. The
results suggested hydrogen as a promising additive for improving
the  combustion  performance  with  low  NOx  and  N
2 O  emissions
under fuel-rich conditions. Furthermore, other studies [289] were
performed  by  the  same  group  on  the  effect  of  ammonia  substi-
tution on ammonia/hydrogen/air flames both experimentally and
computationally.  The  results  showed  that  ammonia  substitution
will significantly reduce laminar flame speed and increase nitrogen
oxide emissions in hydrogen/air flames. It was also found that ni-
trogen oxide emission of fuel rich conditions are much lower than
fuel lean conditions.

Kumar and Meyer [269] performed a series of measurements
of laminar flame speeds for ammonia/hydrogen/air jet flames. In
this study, ammonia fraction within the fuel was varied in step in-
creases of energy delivered up to a maximum of 80% for equiva-
lence ratios between 0.5 and 1.1. Computational models were de-
veloped using the GRI-Mech 3.0, Tian, and Konnov reaction mech-
anisms. Numerical calculations on laminar flame speed consider-
ing  heat  loss  showed  that  Konnov  mechanism  and  Tian  mech-
anism  have  good  prediction  accuracy  against  experimental  data,
highlighting production of the OH radical as the key performance
variable in modelling laminar NH
3 decomposition. Simultaneously,
work conducted by Xiao et al. [231] has demonstrated that the use
of GRI-Mech 3.0 for prediction of ammonia based flames under-
predicts  several  fundamental  characteristics  of  such  flames.  Al-
though  Konnov’s  and  Tian’s  provided  good  results,  as  shown  by
others [269] , Mathieu’s performed better when using fundamental
parameters such as flame speed.

As  shown  in  Fig.  29  [231] ,  different  mechanisms  present  dif-
ferent performance while predicting flame speed when compared
with  experimental  data  [215] .  Results  show  that  performance  of

these mechanisms for prediction of various ammonia fractions sig-
nificantly varies, e.g. when ammonia fraction of ammonia is less
than 50% the predictions are relatively poor as compared to those
using greater mole fractions. This indicates that low ammonia frac-
tion combustion chemistry for NH
2 blends still needs to be op-
timized. Furthermore, it was identified that hydrogen has an accel-
erant  role  in  hydrogen/ammonia/air  combustion,  while  ammonia
has a major detrimental effect in laminar flame speed.

3 /H

In the research of Ichikawa et al. [290] , hydrogen/ammonia/air
flames  were  experimentally  and  numerically  investigated  at  el-
evated  pressures  up  to  0.5 MPa.  The  laminar  flame  speed  in-
creased exponentially as the hydrogen fraction in the blend was
increased,  reaching  a  similar  order  of  magnitude  observed  for
conventional  hydrocarbon  flames  when  the  hydrogen  fraction  in
the  fuel  is  0.4.  Decrease  of  laminar  flame  speed  was  identified
with increasing initial pressure conditions in this study. Moreover,
it  was  demonstrated  that  the  Markstein  length  decreases  when
the ambient mixture pressure was increased from 0.1 to 0.3 MPa,
with  the  Markstein  lengths  at  0.5 MPa  very  similar  to  those  at
0.3 MPa.

To  determine  the  impact  of  practical  conditions  such  as  el-
evated  ambient  temperatures  and  pressures  on  the  combustion
of ammonia, analysis using premixed ammonia–air mixtures with
equivalence  ratios  around  unity,  at  conditions  which  are  en-
countered  in  Spark  Ignition  engines  have  also  been  performed.
Duynslaegher et al. [265] numerically investigated laminar flame
speed  and  NOx  emission  concentrations  of  premixed  ammonia
combustion  using  Konnov’s  mechanism  at  elevated  pressure  and
temperature  conditions  (0.1–4.9 MPa,  298–732 K),  relevant  condi-
tions for engine operation. In this study, corresponding to a 40% in-
crease in compression ratio, the laminar flame speed increases up
to 30% whilst a difference of 100 K is noted for the adiabatic flame
temperature. It is suggested that both equivalence ratio and com-
pression ratios have an important impact on the adiabatic flame
temperature  and  laminar  flame  speed  while  equivalence  ratio  is
the major factor influencing the NO formation. Then Hayakawa et
al. [266] evaluated the flame speed for spherically propagating pre-
mixed flames of ammonia/air under elevated conditions. It was the
first experimental work that clarified the decrease of flame speed
under  high  pressure  condition  up  to  0.5  Mpa.  It  demonstrated
that Konnov’s model, established for ammonia combustion analy-
ses, over-predicts laminar burning velocity. At the same time, Li et
al. [284] numerically investigated the ammonia combustion char-
acteristics  under  oxygen  enriched  conditions  and  proposed  it  as
a potential method to improve ammonia combustion performance
and flame speed.

was measured. Li et al. [293] studied ammonia-doped methane/air
flames on a perforated plate burner at atmospheric pressure us-
ing laser-saturated fluorescence (LSF) and probe sampling for NO
concentrations measurement. It was suggested that the results of
ammonia conversion disagree with some other earlier experiments
due to their lack of proper coating in cylinders. Also, the exper-
imental results of NOx formation were accurately reproduced by
the flame modelling with the Konnov mechanism, which verified
the capability in predicting ammonia conversion both in lean and
in rich flames.

At high temperature, findings suggest that blow-off limits, the
concentration  of  radicals  H,  OH  and  O  and  the  maximum  flame
temperature  are  enhanced  with  H

NH
3 /air flames, demonstrating that hydrogen doping could poten-
tially facilitate the use of ammonia as a reliable alternative fuel,
with  increased  laminar  burning  velocity,  reduction  of  emissions
and  positive  changes  in  Markstein  length  [261,262,290,294–297] .
Moreover, the peak laminar flame speed for NH
3 -air combustion
across equivalence ratio is ∼0.08 m/s, compared to an equivalent
value of ∼2.80 m/s for H
2 . This provides the opportunity for sig-
nificant variation as the mixture ratio changes. Results presented
by Lee et al. [262] analyse three different equivalence ratios (0.60,
1.00, 1.67), increasing the NH
3  mole fraction in hydrogen at five
stages  in  the  range  of  0.0–0.3.  The  changes  in  flame  speed  and
mass  burning  flux  measured  are  shown  in  Fig.  30  results  are
presented against equivalent Stoichiometric Fraction of Ammonia
(SFA), in the range 0.0 0 0 – 0.375.

Further  progress  in  understanding  the  behaviour  of  these
flames is reported in [290,298] using hydrogen flames doped with
NO and ammonia. Results presented the analysis of using differ-

served  for  conventional  hydrocarbon  flames  when  the  hydrogen
fraction in the fuel is 0.4. Moreover, it was demonstrated that the
Markstein  length  decreases  when  the  ambient  mixture  pressure
was increased from 0.1 to 0.3 MPa, with the Markstein lengths at
0.5 MPa very similar to those at 0.3 MPa.

As  for  the  combustibility  of  ammonia  and  hydrogen  doped
ammonia/air  flames,  in  the  experiments  of  Shebeko  et  al.
[299]  flammability  limits  for  ammonia  and  ammonia/hydrogen
mixtures  were  studied  at  temperatures  and  pressures  of  up  to
343 K  and  1.0 MPa  respectively.  It  was  identified  that  the  lower
concentration  limit  of  ammonia/oxygen  flame  decreases  signifi-
cantly at elevated temperature and pressure. Pfahl et al. [300] also
studied the flammability limits, ignition energies, and flame speeds
of different ammonia contained mixtures experimentally. The ex-
periments were carried out in a closed combustion vessel at initial
pressures of 0.1 MPa and temperatures of 295 K. The ignition en-
ergy experiment results of lean ammonia–nitrous oxide mixtures
indicate that under high ignition energies (higher than 50 0 0 J) the
initiation of combustion occurs independent of fuel amount of am-
monia, while there is an obvious minimum concentration of am-
monia fuel for low ignition energies (up to 10 J). It is also shown
that increasing the initial amount of nitrous oxide in ammonia–
air–nitrous  oxide  gases  increases  the  laminar  flame  speed.  Cic-
carelli et al. [301] explored the flammability map of ammonia and
ammonia/hydrogen mixtures in air at the initial temperature up to
873 K and atmospheric pressure conditions. The flammability map
showed to widen linearly with increased initial temperature. It was
also shown that as the mixture fraction of the ammonia dissoci-
ation  products  increased  in  mixtures  of  ammonia  and  hydrogen
and nitrogen - the ammonia dissociation products, the flammabil-
ity limits tend to widen.

Lee  and  Kwon  [302]  numerically  studied  counterflow  non-
premixed  ammonia/hydrogen/air  flames  at  normal  temperature
and pressure to improve the safety of hydrogen use. Effects of am-
monia on reducing high-stretch extinction limits of hydrogen/air
flames were identified. Um et al. [260] experimentally examined
the  combustion  stability  limits  and  nitrogen  oxide  emissions  of
non-premixed  ammonia/hydrogen/air  flames  at  normal  tempera-
ture  and  pressure  conditions.  The  study  justified  the  potential

[294] explored the potential of using H
ing the reactivity and ignition of nonpremixed NH

extinction limits, flame temperature and morphology of the coun-

mentally  determined  at  elevated  temperatures  and  normal  pres-
sure. Results showed enhanced blow-off limits and the maximum
flame  temperature  with  hydrogen  substitution  in  ammonia  /air
flames. A summary of the relevant studies on ammonia combus-
tion stability is presented in Table 7 .

Ignition  delay,  another  important  combustion  parameter,  can
also provide insights of the accuracy of various chemical models.
In the work of Mathieu et al. [277] , ammonia oxidation and igni-
tion delay time were measured in a shock tube for a wide range
of  conditions  at  pressures  above  1.0 MPa.  As  can  be  seen  from
Fig.  31 ,  data  from  Mathieu  et  al.  [277]  are  compared  to  several
updated literature models. As for Konnov and   ̊AA mechanism, it
is clear that differences of more than an order of magnitude are
recorded, while Tian, Mendiara and Mathieu’s mechanisms show
good prediction. Thus, chemistry prediction under various condi-
tions is still a problem for modelling purposes, as the reaction of
ammonia is highly dependent on the conditions used for develop-
ment of each reaction mechanism [231] . For this particular case,
high pressurised conditions seem to be better predicted using the
latest mechanism.

Emissions  related,  Li  et  al.  [215]  have  studied  a  range  of  hy-
drogen  and  ammonia  blends  in  order  to  observe  the  emissions
produced at different equivalence ratios, simultaneously showing
that  NH

and thermal-NOx has a negligible role in H
3 -air com-
It was observed that thermal-NOx decreases in H
bustion compared to pure H
2 -air combustion, while NOx concen-
tration reached its maximum at the stoichiometric condition. Fur-
ther works provide modelling analyses of hydrogen-doped ammo-
nia blends with preheating of the reactants. Results showed that
2 → NO + O,
the formation reaction rates of thermal NO from N + O
and N + OH → NO + H increased with increasing reactant preheating
under fuel lean condition. Under fuel rich conditions, the reactions
2 O, NH + NO → NNH + OH were shown to have
of NH
a great effect on the decomposition of NO at all preheating tem-
peratures of the reactants, which results in an extremely low NO
formation rate, indicating the potential to reduce NO formation in
NH
3 combustion [303] . However, it must be emphasized that cur-
rent technologies have been only capable of reducing NOx in the
combustion zone by a trade-off between the latter and unburned
ammonia. Hence, the results suggest that combustion of H
2  and
NH
3 should be carefully considered for the practical utilization of
this blend.

of OH, NH and NO profiles for premixed ammonia/air flames us-
ing contemporary laser-induced fluorescence at atmospheric pres-
sure. The kinetics analysis combined with this experimental data
showed that the Mendiara mechanism performed best prediction
for temperature, radical profiles and flame front positions.

Regarding other radicals and their impact on emissions, HNO
is an important radical for the production of NO which is mainly
2 , O, O
produced from the interaction of NH x radicals with OH, H
2
and H
2 O [305] . Thus, enhancement of these radicals can increase
the production of NOx emissions. This has been recently demon-
strated by Valera-Medina et al. [36] who showed the increase of
NO  emissions  by  a  couple  of  orders  of  magnitude  in  transition-
ing  from  lean  to  rich  conditions  during  experiments  within  an
industrially-relevant generic swirl combustor. The increase of OH
radicals in the lean region directly impacts on the production of
HNO, thus increasing nitrogen oxides considerably. The trend was
clearly identified not only by the experimental diagnostics, but also
by reaction models. Recommendations are based on avoiding these
regimes  under  fully  premixed  conditions,  suggesting  the  use  of
stratified injection to eliminate lean combustion spots prone to the
interaction of NH x radicals and OH that will benefit production of
HNO. A further study [306] utilising 1D and 2D numerical simu-
lations using GRI-3.0 Mech predicts the production of NOx at dif-
ferent oxygen/hydrogen/ammonia concentrations. The results show
the complex interaction between the different formation mecha-
nisms of nitrogen oxides, with a competition between thermal and
fuel  based  nitrogen  reactions  that  reaches  a  peak  followed  by  a

duction in reaction rates combined with the impact of ammonia
as NO production accelerator in the internal layers and as inhibitor
of nitrogen oxides in the external layers. However, as previously
stated,  this  chemical  reaction  model  has  shown  a  lower  perfor-
mance when analysing ammonia based fuels.

Methane,  as  previously  stated,  has  also  been  proposed  for
blending  with  ammonia  in  power  generation  devices.  Oxidation
of NH
2 concen-
trations, has also been studied as another option to improve the
combustion process [276] . High levels of CO
2  were shown to en-
hance the formation of NO under reducing conditions, whilst in-
hibiting  NO  formation  under  stoichiometric  and  lean  conditions.
The  enhanced  CO  concentrations  and  variation  of  the  quantity

2 + H to form NH are inhibited due
NH

In  the  work  of  Tian  et  al.  [274] ,  flames  with  different  mole
4  were  experimentally  studied.  Mole  frac-
ratios  (R)  of  NH
tion of flame species such as reactants, intermediates and prod-
ucts were specifically determined, providing a deep insight into the
characteristics  of  ammonia/methane  flame  chemistry.  As  shown
in  Fig.  32 ,  an  increase  in  R  increases  the  NO  quantities  at  the
exhaust.  Comparison  of  experimental  data  against  predictions  of
several  widely  tested  kinetic  models  shows  that  Konnov  mech-
anism  gives  the  best  performance,  which  is  also  widely  verified
in  other  ammonia  combustion  studies.  The  pathway  of  ammo-
nia  oxidation  is  also  figure  out  in  this  study,  Fig.  33 .  Thus,  the
study concludes that the main formation source of NO is from the
reactions HNO + H → NO + H
2 O (SR306) and
NH + O → NO + H (SR376).

study was undertaken for equivalence ratios between 0.5–1.5 and
for NH
3 fractions of 0% to 5% by volume in the fuel, as observed in
some industrial processes. The measured burning velocities agreed
well with simulated results and the addition of 4% ammonia was
seen to result in a 10% - 20% decrease in burning velocity. Both
simulations and experiments showed that adding NH
4 -air
mixtures resulted in an increase in NOx concentration, especially
at stoichiometric conditions, with a minimal effect on CO forma-
tion. Near the flammability limits, less than 0.1% of the incoming
3 penetrated the flame. Further numerical studies for premixed
NH
flames using methane/ammonia/air have been undertaken to char-
acterise the use of these blends in industrial processes [230,291] ,
Figs. 34 and 35 . Results indicate the potential application of blends
for backup power generation, especially at rich equivalence ratios
due to the lower NO emissions. However, it is clear the complex

path during production of emissions, as previously stated, thus re-
quiring further research for their mitigation.

Other  studies  have  considered  the  reaction  of  ammonia  with
4 , CO and NOx [264] for practical scenarios. Nu-
species such as CH
3  may be con-
merical and experimental results showed that NH
verted mainly to NO or to N
2 , depending on reaction conditions
[264] . The aim of these primary measures is to promote the for-
2  by  limiting  the  availability  of  oxygen  while  oxi-
mation  of  N
dising other molecules. The reactions of NH
3  with the O/H radi-
cal pool is fairly well established over a wide temperature range,
all showing significant non-Arrhenius behaviour. The chemistry of
the smaller amines, NH
2  and NH, is more uncertain; in particu-
lar  the  rate  constants  for  the  radical–radical  reactions.  At  mod-
erate  temperatures  below  1400 K,  the  fate  of  NH
2  largely  deter-
mines the oxidation pathway of the ammonia as well as the re-
action selectivity toward NO and N
2 . The key step in the produc-
tion of NO is the fast NH x + HNO reaction. The reactions with these
molecules have been barely studied experimentally in the interme-
diate temperature range, and so their rate constants present sig-
nificant uncertainties. The comparatively low temperatures utilised
in  studies  to  date,  as  well  as  the  presence  of  NO,  promote  the

2 → NH → N, which is important at higher temperatures.

Although the results are relevant for the study of NH

3 and the
role  of  radicals  across  the  different  boundaries  of  the  flame  to-
wards production of nitrogen oxides, it is evident that considerable
work is still required to determine the role of ammonia and other
radicals in the formation and consumption of NOx through flames
to determine a most general and accurate reaction model, as cur-
rently there are various available in the literature.

Therefore, knowing these parameters can provide support for
development of new designs, equipment and control of emissions
when  employing  ammonia  combustion.  Hence,  research  groups
have been studying these fundamental parameters for the use of
ammonia  with  various  blends  under  different  operational  condi-
tions. The ignition characteristics of ammonia, flame speed, Mark-
stein length, combustibility, characterisation of emission profiles of
species such as NH
2 O and NO [304] , radical forma-
tion, etc. are all crucial in gaining understanding and confidence in
the behaviour of reaction mechanisms with new fuels such as am-
monia. Combination of all these parameters can provide more ac-
curate data for development of new models capable of predicting
the combustion regimes that are imposed in more complex sys-
tems.

3.5.4. Practical conditions

More complex scenarios such as combustion of turbulent flames
under atmospheric conditions at high inlet temperatures have fol-
lowed  the  work  of  ammonia  combustion  [307,308] .  The  studies
elucidate the reduction of NO under fuel rich conditions, with a
specific equivalence ratio where both unburned ammonia and ni-
trogen oxides reach their minimum level. Rich equivalence ratios of
1.15 and 1.20 have provided the best results with the lowest emis-
3  over these simulations
sions in terms of NO and unburned NH
and other data generated by Valera-Medina et al. [228] , points that
require  further  studies.  Similarly,  other  experiments  [309]  have
shown that this value changes to 1.05 under atmospheric condi-
tions and isothermal chamber walls. Although fuel-rich conditions
appear to be the most promising for low NOx ammonia combus-
tion, it should be remembered that unburned ammonia is still pro-
duced, and its management needs to be considered for further ap-
plications.

Zieba et al. [280] have studied the interaction of ammonia at
different concentrations (0 to 900 ppmV) with natural gas (mainly

methane)  and  two  syngases  (i.e.  one  with  methane,  the  other
without it) for flameless applications (so-called ‘FLOX’ systems) at
20 kW power. The results showed that ammonia reacts relatively
late compared to methane at fuel lean conditions, leading to high
NOx emissions. In the pre-ignition zone, the ammonia chemistry is
inhibited due to the absence of free radicals, which are consumed
by  the  methane–methyl  radical  (CH
3 )  conversion.  In  the  case  of
2 , 42%N
ammonia/methane-free syngas (i.e. 25%H
2
vol%), ammonia was observed to react very rapidly, and complete
decomposition  was  reached  in  the  fuel-rich  region  of  the  flame.
The hydrogen contained in the fuel ignites directly after the nozzle
and releases enough radicals to start the ammonia decomposition.
The released radicals are not completely consumed by other com-
bustibles and easily react with NH

2 , 18%CO, 15%CO

3 [280] .

As a final remark of this subsection, it is clear from all the cur-
rent research that there is still a knowledge gap related to the in-
teraction  of  species  and  radicals  at  different  conditions  and  fuel
blends, thus prompting the research in these areas to create mod-
els that accurately predict the behaviour of ammonia doped flames
under conditions relevant to practical industrial environments.

3.5.5. Combustion catalysis

Finally, an interesting topic that has contributed to the progres-
sion of combustion/power applications at small and medium scales
is  the  use  of  combustion  through  catalytic  materials.  Recent  re-
search has shown that using porous blocks is an advantageous and
practical way to stabilize premixed flames [310,311] . In summary,
porous media improves the fluid properties to enhance burning ve-
locity, thus increasing flame stabilisation. These characteristics can
have considerable advantages for the consumption of ammonia for
combustion purposes. In addition, the high thermal conductivity of
some materials such as SiC increase the heat conduction from the
flame to the surrounding zones, thus decreasing undesirable emis-
sions [312] .

Researchers in Turkey and Japan have started working on the
concept  of  catalytic  combustion  of  ammonia.  Although  the  liter-
ature that exists on the topic is extremely limited, Hinokuma et
al.  [313]  have  recently  published  the  use  of  copper  oxides  and
silver  catalysts  supported  on  aluminium  oxides  for  the  combus-
tion of NH
3 . The concept allows low temperature combustion that
minimizes  NOx  production,  as  thermal  NOx  are  minimized.  Al-
though  thermal  NOx  is  a  minor  contributor  to  all  nitrogen  ox-
ides  produced  in  ammonia  flames,  nevertheless,  their  reduction
contributes  to  emissions  control.  The  use  of  novel  thermal  pre-
treatments  have  ensured  that  these  materials  can  withstand  the
elevated  temperatures  of  operation  ( ∼1173 K).  Similarly,  research
conducted by Nozari et al. [314,315] showed the high efficiency of
burning ammonia via SiC porous media with a large operational
range. Simulations and experiments provided validated results that
demonstrate the potential of burning ammonia at low power rates
using these configurations, Fig. 36 .

In Japan, ammonia is building momentum as an important el-
ement in a hydrogen-oriented energy economy [13] . Thus, the re-
search complies with a new wave of studies that aim to demon-
strate ammonia as a hydrogen carrier capable of providing flexibil-
ity whilst ensuring a cost-effective transition to a hydrogen econ-
omy. It is likely that these porous materials will support the use of
small to medium size boilers, supporting the implementation of a
“Hydrogen through Ammonia” economy.

4. Conclusions

Ammonia  is  one  of  the  most  widely  transported  bulk-
manufactured chemicals, having been mass produced throughout
the world for more than a century, and its manufacture thought to
account for approximately 2% of global energy production. While

ammonia is a toxic and corrosive gas, the wide-ranging experience
and expertise in synthesis, transportation and utilisation of ammo-
nia significantly reduces concerns about its further exploitation. In-
deed, well tested and successful health and safety protocols and
regulations already exist for every aspect of its industrial applica-
tion, from synthesis through to combustion.

The original applications of ammonia were in the chemical and
agriculture industries and it still finds its greatest application as a
fertilizer for intensive crop farming. Nevertheless, in addition to its
traditional applications, ammonia is an energetic chemical energy
store  with  favourable  physical  properties,  especially  when  com-
pared to other chemical energy storage media. Notably, it forms
a liquid at relatively low pressures ( ∼0.8 MPa) and is readily and
reversible stored within solids at high gravimetric densities, unlike
hydrogen gas, and may be combusted without producing CO
2 , un-
like hydrocarbon fuels. Consequently, its energy content has been
explored  as  a  chemical  for  power  generation  globally  in  recent
years.  Although  considerable  research  into  its  use  as  a  working
fluid  in  cycles,  fuel  for  combustion  engines,  electrochemical  de-
vices  and  turbines  presents  many  challenges,  these  technologies
can  become  widely  adopted  and  commercially  viable  with  the
appropriate  research  and  investment.  While  significant  empirical
and  theoretical  progress  has  been  made  on  optimising  fuel/co-
fuel/oxidant ratios and the nature and process of the combustion
processes,  more  work  is  still  required to  develop optimised  sys-
tems  for  specific  applications,  starting  with  the  development  of
models  that  are  accurate  at  specific,  practical  operational  condi-
tions. Moreover, the excessive NOx production using this molecule
requires that models focus on developing chemical kinetic models
that can be integrated within a more general model for use in the
design and control of ammonia-based fuel systems for power gen-
eration.

Despite the long period since its inception, most notably in Bel-
gium in 1942, it is only now that ammonia is being seriously con-
sidered as fuel both for mobile and large renewable energy storage
2 with high flexibility
applications, thus supporting reduction of CO
of supply. While ammonia is currently most cheaply synthesised
from reforming of natural gas, producing H
2 , it may also
be synthesised using sustainable sources including solar, wind or
2 via electroly-
2 via liquefaction) and water (for H
tidal, air (for N
sis), with minimal environmental pollutants.

2 and CO

Thus,  ammonia  can  be  produced  using  renewable  sources
which not only contributes to greenhouse emissions reduction, but
also:

• Offers  flexibility  in  terms  of  its  utilisation,  as  it  can  be  em-
ployed as working fluid in power cycles, energy storage from
2  cap-
waste  streams,  cooling  medium,  or  as  chemical  for  CO
ture; however, there is still a need for research that will provide
the foundations for the coupling of ammonia with the variety
of available options for its use in power cycles, i.e. as a work-
ing fluid from waste streams that thermodynamically enhances
2  capture.  Although  such  concept
cooling  with  combined  CO
seems as a technological advantage, progression on the topic is
in its infancy and needs further evaluation in terms of the im-
pacts of the molecule at high temperatures and flowrates, con-
sequence of the corrosive nature of ammonia;

• Allows fuel cells to be run effectively using smaller, safer and
economically viable configurations that will enable efficient re-
covery and utilisation of hydrogen for lower environmental im-
pact.  However,  fuel  cells  still  generally  produce  per  unit  low
power  and  many  configurations  require  clean  fuel  sources  –
i.e. no carbon or ammonia from cracking- to avoid poisoning,
a characteristic that increases equipment complexity and still
needs further technological advances for deployment at scale
and lower cost; other devices, such as high temperature solid
oxide fuel cells and alkaline fuel cells, are appropriate for com-
bined  heat  and  power,  and  represent  a  real  opportunity  for
commercial purposes to exploit ammonia as a fuel source;

• Enables combustion systems to be employed using a chemical
that, once better understood and characterised, has the poten-
tial of operating at high power whilst producing tolerable levels
of  emissions.  It must  be emphasized that  researchers around
the world are now trying to characterise the complex nature
of the interaction of the species and radicals that are formed
during the combustion process of ammonia and the different
combustion characteristics of the flames, thus focusing research
on creating more accurate and simpler models that can be used
for practical applications;

• In practical power generators such as engines and gas turbines,
the recovery of hydrogen from a chemical capable of distribut-
ing it easily and economically provides great advantages, with

96

longer operability ranges and feasibility to produce medium to
large power outputs. However, the main issue with these tech-
nologies still relies on the NOx emissions produced through the
combustion process along with unburned ammonia that usually
appears in the flue gas streams. Promising results appear in the
range of rich fuel combustion ( φ > 1.10), where the recombina-
tion of species seems to have positive effects on NOx reduction
through the production of OH radicals, a concept that requires
furthers investigation;

• Enables  advanced  propulsion  systems  to  be  developed  with
smaller tanks, and the capacity to use a chemical with wider
accessibility. Previous developments produced highly advanced
systems  that  compete  with  currently  available  technologies.
Thus, the future for ammonia in propulsion systems could re-
turn to its development for commercial use in large propulsion
devices. However, nowadays the use of ammonia appears to be
focussed on smaller propulsion thrusters for satellites and rock-
ets, which requires energy for splitting the ammonia molecule
into its hydrogen components;

• Facilitates the development of burners based on catalytic mate-
rials which can be conceptualised for small-scale applications.
These use ammonia and its inherent hydrogen in the produc-
tion of heat, hence reducing the generation of heat from fos-
sil fuel sources. However, these catalytic materials are still un-
der development, currently providing miniscule heat rates un-
der current operation conditions.

Thus, the ease of storage, transportation and use of ammonia
makes it an attractive candidate to act as the energy vector be-
tween sustainable energy harvesting and mobile and static energy
demands. Consequently, one could imagine its use across all appli-
cation scales from micro-thrusters, small refrigerators and personal
transportation through to large ( > 1MW) energy buffering. How-
ever, as emphasised through this review, there are still many fields
that require further development and understanding, some funda-
mental in nature while others practical in essence.

Thus, as industry, governments and society turn to more sus-
tainable technologies for power generation, and the use of fossil
fuels becomes ever more constrained “Hydrogen through Ammo-
nia” economy via Ammonia for Power – with supporting research
- provides an attractive, practical proposition which seems to have
increasing industrial support.

Dr. Agustin Valera-Medina is a Senior Lecturer in Cardiff
School of Engineering. His research interests include al-
ternative fuels, hydrodynamics, flame stabilization, fuel
injection,  heat  transfer  and  combustion  technologies.
He  has  participated  as  PI/CI  on  18  industrial  projects
with multi-nationals including GE, PEMEX, Rolls-Royce,
Siemens,  Alstom,  Ricardo  and  EON.  He  has  published
105 papers, 17 of these specifically concerning ammonia
power. He has supervised 20 PhD students - with 9 suc-
cessfully graduated - and 2 PDRAs since his appointment
in 2012. He has won international conference awards in-
cluding AIAA ‘Best Paper in Terrestrial Technologies’ in
2010 and 2013, and the SDEWES SEE 2018 "Best Paper".
His international works on ammonia are underway with universities such as Oxford,
Trinity College Dublin, NUS, Tsinghua, Xiamen, Exeter, Leicester, Loughborough, UCL,
Imperial College, CIDESI, Educon, etc. and companies such as Siemens, Yara, Tokyo
Gas, C-Job Naval, amongst many others. He is a member of the ETN Ammonia Gas
Turbines subgroup. Dr Valera-Medina currently leads Cardiff’s contribution to the
Innovate-UK ‘Decoupled Green Energy’ Project (2015–2018) led by Siemens and in
partnership with STFC and the University of Oxford, which aims to demonstrate
the use of green ammonia produced from wind energy for production, storage and
conversion to power of this chemical.

Dr Hua Xiao is a recently graduated researcher working
on the topic of Ammonia Power Generation in Gas Tur-
bines. He passed his VIVA in May 2018. He has partic-
ipated as first author and co-author of 11 publications
related  to  ammonia  gas  turbines  and  improvement  of
chemical reaction models for the use of this chemical.
He has worked in the topics of combined cycles, micro
flame stability systems, power plants using heavy fuels
and waste utilization, amongst many other topics. He was
supported through a CSC scholarship provided by the Chi-
nese government to complete his PhD topic at Cardiff
University, and has recently received confirmation of his
new post as Research Assistant at Tsinghua University,

China, as a member of the Centre for Combustion Energy.

Prof Martin Owen-Jones is the Energy Materials and CDT
coordinator at the ISIS Facility (UK), being honorary pro-
fessor at the University of St Andrews since 2015. He
graduated from Nottingham University where he also did
his PhD studies. After that he was a postdoctoral fellow
at the University of Birmingham, ERASMUS Research Fel-
low at the CRISMAT research facility, Caen (France) and
Director of Research for Professor Peter Edwards at the
Inorganic Chemistry Laboratory, Oxford. He took up his
present positions in November 2011 and teaches Inor-
ganic Chemistry at Lincoln. Professor Jones’ research in-
terests centre on the study of energy materials, rang-
ing from superconductors, through transparent conduct-
ing oxides and hydrogen storage materials to catalysts and in particular research
into low-carbon energy storage systems. His recent work has focused on the de-
velopment of systems to detect, store and utilise ammonia as a chemical energy
storage medium.

Prof Bill David is a Fellow of the Royal Society. His re-
search spans the fields of energy materials chemistry and
the atomic, molecular and nano-structure of materials at
Oxford University and the Science and Technology Facili-
ties Council (STFC) UK. The energy materials studies cen-
tre where he is an active research member works on
the discovery and characterisation of novel chemical en-
ergy  storage  systems,  focusing  in  developing hydrogen
and ammonia as energy vectors. He uses neutron and
synchrotron  X-ray  diffraction  combined  with  computa-
tional modelling as part of the principal techniques for
the structural elucidation of materials. In the area of en-
ergy materials, his studies have included in-situ neutron
powder diffraction measurements combined with gravimetric analysis for the study
of reversible lightweight hydrogen storage materials and mass spectrometry for the
investigation of novel ammonia decomposition materials.

Prof Bowen spent 5 years working for Shell Research
at Thornton Research Centre studying very large multi-
phase explosion hazards after the Piper-Alpha disaster in
the North Sea, before joining the Energy Group at Cardiff
School of Engineering in 1994. He led the £7.8 M project
(2004–7) to relocate the former UK Defence Evaluation
Research Agency (DERA) national gas turbine combustion
research facility from Farnborough (Pyestock) to Port Tal-
bot, launched by former Welsh First Minister Rhodri Mor-
gan in 2007. The rebranded Gas Turbine Research Centre
(GTRC), for which Phil is founding Director, has since been
enhanced to enable studies of multi-component fuel mix-
tures relevant to electrical power generators, and also op-
tical combustors enabling laser-based interrogation of the combustion and emis-
sion processes. Phil has been awarded over £30 M as PI/CI from over 100 grants,
published over 200 peer reviewed publications and supervised to completion 30
PhD students over 22 years as an academic. He has served on many national and
international executive/steering committees and currently serves on the Interna-
tional Energy Agency (IEA) Technology Collaboration Programme (for Combustion
and Emission Reduction), RCUK ’Energy’ strategic advisory committee, British Sec-
tion of the Combustion Institute, Trustee for UK Explosion Liaison Group, etc.
