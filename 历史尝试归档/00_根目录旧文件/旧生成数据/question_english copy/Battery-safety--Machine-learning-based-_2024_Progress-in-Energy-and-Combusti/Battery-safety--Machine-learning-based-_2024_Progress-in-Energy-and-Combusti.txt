Lithium-ion batteries play a pivotal role in a wide range of applications, from electronic devices to large-scale
electrified transportation systems and grid-scale energy storage. Nevertheless, they are vulnerable to both pro-
gressive aging and unexpected failures, which can result in catastrophic events such as explosions or fires. Given
their expanding global presence, the safety of these batteries and potential hazards from serious malfunctions are
now  major  public  concerns.  Over  the  past  decade,  scholars  and  industry  experts  are  intensively  exploring
methods to monitor battery safety, spanning from materials to cell, pack and system levels and across various
spectral, spatial, and temporal scopes. In this Review, we start by summarizing the mechanisms and nature of
battery failures. Following this, we explore the intricacies in predicting battery system evolution and delve into
the specialized knowledge essential for data-driven, machine learning models. We offer an exhaustive review
spotlighting the latest strides in battery fault diagnosis and failure prognosis via an array of machine learning
approaches.  Our  discussion  encompasses:  (1)  supervised  and  reinforcement  learning  integrated  with  battery
models, apt for predicting faults/failures and probing into failure causes and safety protocols at the cell level; (2)
unsupervised,  semi-supervised,  and  self-supervised  learning,  advantageous  for  harnessing  vast  data  sets  from
battery  modules/packs;  (3)  few-shot  learning  tailored  for  gleaning  insights  from  scarce  examples,  alongside
physics-informed machine learning to bolster model generalization and optimize training in data-scarce settings.
We conclude by casting light on the prospective horizons of comprehensive, real-world battery prognostics and
management.

1. Introduction

Switching to renewable energy offers numerous urban sustainability
benefits, from combating energy poverty to addressing climate change
[1].  However,  the  intermittency  of  renewable  sources  presents  chal-
lenges.  Electrochemical  energy  storage  systems  can  bridge  the  gap,
ensuring  consistent  energy supply by  decoupling  generation  and con-
sumption timings [2]. In the last decade, lithium-ion batteries have seen
significant  advancements  due  to  diverse  electrode  materials  and  cell
designs. With an optimal balance of energy and power, they are dubbed
“the hidden workhorse of the mobile era” [3]. These batteries provide
versatile power solutions for applications ranging from wearable elec-
tronics to electric vehicles (EVs) and grid storage, given the right cell

design  and  sizing.  Durability  and  lifespan  remain  paramount,  influ-
encing end-of-life (EOL) costs across applications.

Engineers and researchers globally have invested significant efforts
to  enhance  battery  energy  density,  power  capability,  cycle  life,  and
manufacturing  cost  [4–9].  However,  high-energy  density  cells  can
struggle to ensure safe operation under intricate loading scenarios due to
electrochemical  and  thermal  stability  limits  [10].  While  strides  have
been made in material design for lithium-ion cell safety [11], battery
security remains a primary concern in the EV sector.

Reliable,  extended  operation  has  been  bolstered  by  predicting  the
battery  state  of  health  (SOH)  and  remaining  useful  life  (RUL)  under
varied  conditions  [12],  extensively  reviewed  elsewhere  [13–15].
Beyond  capacity  degradation,  safety  is  pivotal  for  system  operation

[16]. Reports of fire incidents highlight the criticality of battery safety,
particularly unpredictable thermal runaways in EVs [17] and grid-scale
storage  [18,19]. In recent times, thousands of EVs across major com-
panies were recalled due to safety concerns [20], incurring costs esti-
mated in the tens of billions to mitigate hazards [21]. Though battery
failures  are  infrequent  thanks  to  advancements  in  design  and
manufacturing,  their  aftermath  can  be  disastrous  [22].  A  minor  risk
increment  during  battery  life  can,  over  time,  become  a  severe  safety
threat. If thermal runaway occurs, vast quantities of water are needed
for  cooling,  producing  corrosive  runoff,  posing  environmental  risks.
Given these risks, UK legislators are considering classifying lithium-ion
battery storage sites as “hazardous”, enforcing stringent fire safety and
planning controls [23]. For large-scale battery systems, the focus should
be  on  minimizing  the  risk  of  battery  failures  under  real-world
conditions.

Battery  aging  and  failure  mechanisms  stem  from  complex  factors
across various scales, complicating the understanding of failure causes
and outcomes. While research has clarified some failure aspects, accu-
rately  predicting  and  preventing  battery  failures  in  practical  applica-
tions remain elusive.

Efforts  have  centered  on  enhancing  battery  safety  through  cell
chemistry  optimization  [6,24–29].  However,  these  are  hindered  by
present low energy density, limited lifespan, and high production costs
of the battery system. An unresolved issue of paramount importance is
the assurance of secure battery operation in the context of increasing
demands  for  multitasking  in  today’s  environment.  While  significant
strides have been made in detailed battery system modeling, there is still
a gap in tools predicting performance under genuine loading conditions
over extended scales. Initial battery safety models offered insights into
failure  mechanisms  [30–35],  but  might  not  fully  capture  real-world
application  failures.  Typically,  battery  safety  models  and  data-driven
approaches  focusing  on  isolated  cells  or  singular  failure  mechanisms
fall  short  in  predicting  failures  in  real  conditions.  This  is  particularly
evident  in  EVs,  where  intricate  loading  scenarios  and  extensive
series-parallel configurations add complexity [36].

Recent  strides  in  artificial  intelligence  (AI)  [37],  high-throughput
computing  [38],  and  wireless  communication  [39]  have  opened  new
avenues  for  various  scientific  domains,  enabling  problem-solving
through observational data analysis. This has birthed specialized algo-
rithms,  collectively  known  as  machine  learning,  which  grapple  with
system  complexities  and  capitalize  on  spatial-temporal  data  patterns
through prediction and optimization [40,41]. Machine learning appli-
cation in battery research spans material design [42–51], state estima-
tions such as SOC, SOH, and RUL [52–59], to performance optimization
[60,61].

The utilization of machine learning has led to ongoing innovations in
battery science [62]. In certain cases, it has demonstrated the potential
to  outperform  physics-based  methods  [52,54,63],  particularly  in  the
areas  of  battery  prognostics  and  health  management  (PHM)  [64,65].
While  machine  learning  offers  unique  advantages,  challenges  persist,
especially  in  multiscale  and  multiphysics  domains.  Predicting  battery
failure—marked  by  diverse  factors  such  as  chemical  reactions,  gas
emissions, and fire spread—requires interdisciplinary collaboration due
to its complexity across extensive spatial and temporal scales.

In this paper, we start by outlining the fundamental mechanisms and
characteristics of battery faults and failures under a range of operating
conditions (section 2). We then delve into key techniques for data gen-
eration and the relevant performance metrics essential for feature en-
gineering  (section  3).  Subsequent  sections  discuss  various  machine
learning methods (section 4), emphasizing their distinct advantages in
modelling and forecasting the evolution of multiphysics and multiscale
battery systems during their operational lifetime. This covers areas such
as  defect  detection,  state  estimation,  data  augmentation,  and  outlier
analysis,  spanning  scales  from  materials,  through  cells  and  packs,  to
entire EV systems. We conclude by reflecting on current challenges and
future  prospects  (section  5),  drawing  from  real-world  battery  data

analysis.

2. Mechanisms and characteristics of battery failures

While battery cell failure is rare, with typical 18650 NCA cells having
a failure rate of 1–4 in 40 million cells [66], it can result in catastrophic
consequences  such  as  fires  and  explosions  in  energy  storage  applica-
tions.  Specifically,  battery  conditions  related  to  safety  issues  can  be
summarized in Table 1. Battery failure mechanisms, characteristics, and
mitigation  measures  have  been  extensively  reviewed  recently  [10,
67–77],  in  this  context,  we  will  focus  on  failure  scenarios  (Fig.  1),
providing insights into the analysis and prediction of battery failures to
address real-life problems.

2.1. Cell failure under abuse conditions

Battery failure, in general, often evolves from a small fault or issue.
Small  faults  or  problems  within  a  battery,  if  left  unaddressed,  can
escalate and lead to more significant failures or malfunctions over time.
Different  lithium-ion  battery  chemistries  possess  varying  electro-
chemical  characteristics  and  thermal  stabilities,  yet  safety  remains  a
universal concern [16]. To ensure battery safety, worldwide regulations
and  standards  now  incorporate  a  range  of  abuse  tests  [78–84],  sum-
marized in Ref. [85]. Abuse testing evaluates the resilience of a battery
to  different  stressors,  aiming  to  delineate  its  safety  margins  across
various chemistries and designs. Though these tests yield insights into
fault  and  failure  mechanisms  and  thermal  runaway,  correlating  test
conditions with real-world scenarios is challenging.

Broadly, abuse tests encompass mechanical, electrical, and thermal
stresses, pushing batteries beyond their operational limits. Specifically,
these triggers can be categorized as: (1) physical damage from collisions
or  impacts,  (2) inappropriate  charging/discharging protocols,  such  as
overcharging or operating outside temperature bounds, and (3) expo-
sure to high temperatures via direct or indirect heating.

When the abuse procedure is  beyond the tolerance  of the battery,
chemical reactions within the cell are triggered. From this point on, all
battery  components,  including  the  positive  and  negative  electrodes,
electrolyte,  separator,  and  current  collectors,  can  interact  with  each
other  to  some  degree  under  harsh  environmental  conditions.  This
interaction  results  in  a  convoluted  system  of  interconnected  physico-
chemical (thermodynamic and kinetic) processes where the influence of
temperature,  SOC  and  current  rate  is  critical.  The  electrochemical
consequence of the abuse event can be classified by what happens in the
cell  including  (1)  an  internal  short  circuit  caused  by  failure  of  the
separator  [86],  (2)  the  reaction  between  the  plated lithium  and  elec-
trolyte resulting from lithium plating on the anode surface [87], (3) the
unwanted  electrochemical  side  reactions  relating  abnormal  capacity
fade caused by solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation damage and
growth [88], (4) inherent degradation beyond their service life (80 % of
the initial capacity is generally considered to be the EOL), and (5) the
cathode-released oxygen consumed by the anode with large heat gen-
eration [89].

2.2. Cell failure under normal conditions

Lithium-ion  batteries  are  intricate  systems  dependent  on  electro-
chemical redox reactions, charge-transfer reactions, and other material-
based  factors.  Their  performance  is  influenced  by  a  web  of  inter-
connected phenomena, including cell chemistry, charge movement, and
specific  reactions,  which  are  largely  determined  by  the  chemical
makeup of the cell. Even minor shifts in materials, particle morphology,
or operational conditions can significantly affect performance.

A  particularly  concerning  failure  mode  can  suddenly  and  unpre-
dictably trigger thermal runaway, termed as the sudden-death-type in-
ternal  short  circuit  or  spontaneous  combustion  [90].  In  certain
instances, this failure manifests in seconds with no prior warning during

standard battery operation – meaning all cell parameters (voltage, cur-
rent,  temperature,  and  capacity)  appear  normal.  This  unpredictable
combustion can arise at any point in the lifespan of the battery. Initially,
such failures might only present as subtle self-discharge, making them
undetectable by battery management systems (BMS). But these failures
can swiftly escalate, causing rapid temperature and pressure increases
within the cell, potentially leading to fires. The journey from latent risk
to disastrous thermal runaway could span months or even years.

Present thinking is that the sudden battery failures result from in-
ternal “soft shorts” in a cell. The likely scenario is that the “soft shorts” in
the  cells  result  only  in  localized  non-uniform  distributions  of  current
within the cells, but not large enough variations to cause localized high
temperatures  that  can  trigger  thermal  runaway.  On  rare  occasions,
however,  it  can  induce  serious  safety  issues  when  the  “soft  shorts”

develop into “hard shorts”, which could lead to localized high currents
and resultant overheating [91].

The initial local “soft short” could be caused by a number of reasons,
including (i) a nano-size defect in the cell separator [92–94], (ii) metal
particle contamination occurring during manufacturing [95–97], or (iii)
dendrites  resulting  from  significant  lithium  plating  during  the  opera-
tional lifetime [98–100] (Fig. 2). Defect sizes and penetration positions
are two important factors that not only affect capacity loss and leakage
current, but also safe operation [101]. A “soft short” in a cell is generally
a small area (a few square millimeters or smaller) for which the resis-
tance R (Ω cm2) is significantly less than the average value for the cell.
This  defective  area  with  low  resistance  would  lead  to  a  non-uniform
distribution of current inside the cell. The result will be that the cur-
rent I (A) through that region of the cell will be much higher, which will

temperature  will  increase  very  rapidly  (in  seconds),  leading  to  an
escapable  and  uncontrollable  thermal  runaway,  characterized  by  fire
and explosion.

2.3. Thermal runaway propagation at system level

Most of the battery failure events discussed in the previous sections
would occur at the cell level. However, the consequences of the cata-
strophic failure of the cell can be felt on the system level (Fig. 3). The big
events in this case are thermal runaway that happens in EVs [17] and
energy storage stations [18]. When a single cell fails within a module or
pack,  it  can  trigger  a  chain  reaction,  potentially  spreading  to  neigh-
boring cells and resulting in multiple cell thermal runaways. This situ-
ation  poses  a  significant  fire  hazard  and  can  be  extremely  dangerous
[102,103]. A key issue is then the prevention of the propagation of the
cell  failure  to  adjacent  cells.  This  can  be  done  by  distributing  fuses
throughout the module to remove the failed cell from the current path of
the module. In addition, fire retardant material can be placed between
cells and modules to suppress the fire [104]. Finally, the thermal man-
agement  system  could  be  programmed  to  increase  cooling  to  a
maximum in the event of a cell failure [105]. A detailed description of
thermal  runaway  propagation  at  the  system  level  can  be  found  in  a
recent review [70]. Clearly, the hazardous failure and destructive con-
ditions  outlined  above  cannot  be  allowed  to  occur  during  the  daily
operation  of  the  battery.  Beyond  improving  cell  chemistry  and  pack
design, the answer to the question of how data-driven, machine learning
techniques can improve the safe operation of the battery system under
both normal and abuse scenarios is of great significance.

3. Domain knowledge

Fig. 2. The mechanism of battery soft short circuit. Lithium dendrite gen-
eration during the daily operation of batteries may puncture the separator and
lead  to  an  acute  internal  short  circuit.  Dendrites  that  do  not  puncture  the
separator can result in a soft short. Batteries with defects in separators, such as
pinholes, scratches, fluff, inhomogeneity, or surface particles, occurring during
manufacturing are prone to failure after long-term exposure to complex oper-
ating conditions. Additionally, soft shorts can also be caused by unintentional
contamination,  such  as  metal  particles,  on  the  electrode  surface  during
manufacturing.

cause an abnormal temperature increase due to the I2R heating in this
area. Over time, some of these tiny defects can trigger cell degradation in
that area and  even a  collapse of  the separator, leading to  an internal
short circuit when positive and negative electrodes directly contact each
other. This results in a “hard short” exhibiting very high currents, very
high local heating and a large temperature rise, which will trigger the
possible total failure of the cell and thermal runaway. The presence of a
very  small  metal  particle  that  is  embedded  in  the  cell  during
manufacturing is particularly of concern. Such a particle could result in
direct contact between the two electrodes after an incubation period of a
few months to a couple of years. Once a “hard short”  occurs, the cell

During daily operations, concerns revolve around potential battery
failure  from  internal  short  circuits  due  to  manufacturing  defects  or
excessive  currents or  temperatures from misuse. Though industry im-
provements  have  reduced  BMS  malfunctions,  accurately  predicting
battery  failure  remains  elusive  [10,36,106].  However,  most  battery
failures develop over time, from months to years in practical scenarios
[17,69,73], providing an opportunity to detect risks before they esca-
late.  The  advent  of  open  data,  advanced  simulation  techniques,  and
software  has  integrated  machine  learning  into  materials  science  and
battery research [62]. Machine learning, especially within multi-fidelity
frameworks, is apt for predictive tasks. There is good chance to leverage

data-driven  modeling  to  enhance  battery  safety  by  creating  early
warning  systems  and  timely  abuse  detection  mechanisms.  Immediate
challenges  include  efficiently  curating  relevant  datasets  and  deter-
mining  which  data  subsets  are  vital  for  training  machine  learning
models.

3.1. Data generation

Machine  learning  techniques  use  a  combination  of  algorithms,
structures, and data to infer models that learn from direct observation
[107]. For battery failure prediction, despite advancements, there is a
recurrent hurdle: obtaining expansive, high-quality training data [108].
The  relevance  of  the  dataset  critically  influences  the  efficacy  of  the
model, especially in predicting large-scale battery failure scenarios. A
common  method  to  generate  pertinent  data  for  batteries  is  through
laboratory abuse tests. Based on failure mechanisms, safety tests fall into
three categories: mechanical [109–113], electrical [114,115] and ther-
mal  [116,117].  The  data,  detailing  failure  processes,  enriches  our
comprehension of cell failure and highlights research avenues. However,
fully  grasping  all  facets  of  battery  failure  mechanisms  via  lab  tests  is
challenging,  especially  with  rapidly  evolving  battery  technology.  The
occurrence of hazardous battery failures can be attributed to a multitude
of  factors.  Conducting  tests  on  individual  cells  or  isolated  abuse  sce-
narios may not fully replicate real-world battery failures, where various
abuse situations could occur simultaneously under realistic conditions
[36]. While artificially inducing an internal short circuit using methods
such as welding copper slag [95], low melting point wax [118], shape
memory alloy [119], or damaging the separator [120] might streamline
testing, there is a need to discern between manufacturing defects and
lab-induced anomalies. Such research is intricate, merging accelerated
tests  and  real-world  observations,  often  leading  to  potential  observa-
tional errors and poor extrapolation. Unintentional manufacturing de-
fects and  subtle variances  in production conditions further  widen the
gap between lab data and real-world failures (Fig. 4).

3.2. Electrochemical metrics

In  the  past  decade,  advancements  in  electrode  materials  and  cell
designs have sought to optimize electrochemical energy storage devices.
Yet, evaluation methods often lag behind these innovations. Common
laboratory tests for assessing performance include cyclic voltammetry
(CV),  galvanostatic  charge/discharge  (GCD),  and  electrochemical
impedance  spectroscopy  (EIS).  These  tests  yield  critical  parameters:
capacitance/capacity, energy, power, and internal resistance (Fig. 5a).
Additional  parameters,  such  as  cycle  life,  coulombic  efficiency,  self-
discharge,  equivalent  series  resistance  (ESR),  equivalent  distributed
resistance (EDR), retention capability, and time constant can be derived
from  these  electrochemical  techniques,  offering  a  comprehensive  un-
derstanding  of  storage  system  performance.  Global  initiatives  are  un-
derway to standardize performance metrics for energy storage devices
such as batteries and electrochemical capacitors [121–124].

Laboratory evaluations of battery safety, illustrated in Fig. 5b, utilize
techniques such as accelerating rate calorimetry (ARC) [125,126] X-ray
computed  tomography  (CT)  [127–129]  and  energy  dispersive  spec-
trometer  (EDS)  [130,131].  Despite  extensive  research  using  these
techniques,  a  universally  accepted  set  of  metrics  for  characterization
remains elusive. Notable attempts to define hazard levels include stan-
dards from the European Council for Automotive Research and Devel-
opment (EUCAR) [132], Sandia National Laboratory (SAND2005-3123)
[133],  and  Society  of  Automotive  Engineers  (SAE-J2464)  [78].  The
general  approach  is  clear-cut,  but  quantitatively  predicting  battery
safety is still unresolved. One method, state of safety (SOS), operates on
the premise that battery safety is inversely related to abuse conditions
[134]. The battery SOS is determined through a series of abuse tests and
then normalized on a 0 (completely unsafe) to 1 (completely safe) scale,
aligning  with  other  battery  metrics  (SOC,  SOH,  etc.).  This  systematic
approach  provides  a  framework  for  safety  estimation.  Yet,  real-world
conditions often diverge from ideal lab settings. Many intertwined fac-
tors hinder the direct application of lab techniques to practical safety
quantification.  Given  the  limited  understanding  of  certain  failure
mechanisms, especially field failures from micro-shorts or spontaneous

Fig.  4. Bridging  the  gap  between  academic  research  and  industry  involves  integrating  physics  with  machine  learning  approaches.  The  training  data
comprises two primary sources: laboratory-generated cell failure data and field data. This field data includes both failure and operational datasets spanning the
lifespan  of  the  battery.  Lab  data  illuminates  actual  physics  and  offers  insights  into  failure  mechanisms,  aiding  in  the  development  of  physics-based  models.  In
contrast, field data furnishes real-world failure scenarios for data-driven modeling.

combustion, crafting standard metrics to assess battery risks throughout
its operational lifespan is challenging. Thus, an integrated strategy pri-
oritizes  detecting  imminent  abuse  conditions  that  might  cause
near-future failures, underscoring the need for early warning systems.
This tactic often leverages historical operational data and data-driven
modeling  for  failure  prediction.  As  previously  mentioned,  battery
safety risks include (1) mechanical, (2) electrical, (3) thermal, and (4)
electrochemical abuses, as well as (5) unintentional manufacturing de-
fects or contamination. The first four can arise anytime during the cell
life, while the last introduces risks before field deployment. Predicting
failures is complex due to the dynamic interaction of processes across
various scales. Current machine learning applications either process raw
data  using  hand-engineered  features  or  extract  features  using  deep
neural  networks,  which  will  be  further  discussed  in  the  subsequent
section.

3.3. Feature engineering

Machine  learning  offers  significant  tools  for  electrochemistry  and
materials  science  [52,54,61,135,136].  In  this  domain,  feature  engi-
neering  is  crucial  for  predictive  modeling  [137,138].  To  address
real-world  battery  issues,  core  parameters  including  voltage,  current,
and temperature are utilized. In traditional machine learning for battery
evaluation,  features  are  manually  crafted  from  raw  time-series  data
based  on  these  parameters.  Although  deep  learning  has  excelled  in
automatic feature extraction and noise reduction [40,139,140], it has
not  definitively  exhibited  reliable  predictive  capabilities  for  battery
failure across a wide range of operating conditions. Insights from failure
mechanisms  can  guide  feature  engineering  for  physics-based  data--
driven models. Crafting these features demands domain expertise and
meticulous work, but the effort can enhance prediction accuracy.

Potential  features  for  cell  failure  prediction,  depicted  in  Fig.  5b,

encompass internal short circuits [86], lithium-plating [141], capacity
degradation [142], and self-discharge [143] as well as the features that
can  capture  internal defects  and  contamination  [144]. These  features
are critical for forecasting battery safety evolution at the materials level.
It is worth noting that while various techniques evaluate these param-
eters, those best aligned with real-world conditions are prioritized in this
study.

A challenging issue in many current applications is the series-parallel
configuration of battery modules and packs. As noted, failures can arise
without  clear  warnings  during  seemingly  routine  battery  operation.
Relying solely on electrochemical-based, cell-level prediction methods
may  not  sufficiently  predict  pack-level  failures.  Expertise,  combined
with  statistical  methods,  will  likely  be  more  effective  in  forecasting
battery  safety  performance.  These  statistical  features,  illustrated  in
Fig. 6, offer  accurate calculations based  on deviations and  outliers of
pack-level  cell  behavior.  This  can  highlight  potential  failures  from
seemingly minor details. Consistency in battery pack parameters such as
voltage, temperature, SOC, and capacity, as well as statistical attributes
such  as  kurtosis,  skewness,  and  waveform  factor  during  continuous
discharge-recharge cycles, can enhance dynamic signal analysis, offer-
ing richer insights compared to traditional quasi-steady-state methods
[145]. The efficacy of these electrochemical and statistical parameters in
providing  early  failure  indications,  especially  concerning  increasing
risks in thermal runaway, remains uncertain. Still, we posit they will be
helpful,  except  in  cases  of  abrupt  field  failures,  where  no  discernible
risks or degradation signs appear.

To  predict  battery  failure,  approaches  range  from  using  manually
engineered features or features auto-discovered by multilayer networks,

level, physics-based learning at the cell level, and unsupervised/semi-

4. Machine learning for battery safety prognostics

As  discussed  earlier,  a  cell  may  fail  catastrophically  under  both
normal  operating  and  abuse  conditions.  Hence,  battery  PHM  in  real-
world  applications  consists  of  multi-objective,  multiscale  tasks  that
can be approached from various perspectives, extending beyond efforts
related to battery lifetime. These tasks include identifying defective cells
at the material level, monitoring anomalous voltage, thermal, and aging
behavior under various abuse conditions at the cell level, and detecting
inconsistencies and outliers at the pack level. In this section, we frame
the problem of learning from multi-modality battery data (time series,
thermal images, microscopic images, lab datasets, field datasets, real-
time data, historical data, etc.) and elaborate on a variety of machine
learning  models  that  have  gained  prominence  within  the  battery  and
materials science community in the last few years (Fig. 7). Each of these
techniques  (Table  2)  has  a  particular  advantage  in  determining  and
predicting battery parameters and failure/abuse scenarios: (1) machine
learning  in  conjunction  with  physics-based  battery  models,  which  is
better  suited  for  failure  prediction  under  abuse  conditions  at  the  cell

level,  (2)  unsupervised  learning,  semi-supervised  learning  and  self-
supervised learning, which provide powerful tools for analysis of large
volumes of non-annotated data from battery modules/packs, (3) solving
few-shot  problems  by  using  transfer  learning,  generative  adversarial
networks (GANs), etc. and physics-informed machine learning used for
improved accuracy, faster training and enhanced generalization in the
small data regime.

4.1. Machine learning in conjunction with battery model

Over  the  past  decades,  mathematical  equations  have  been  widely
used by scientists to simulate multiphysics and multiscale battery sys-
tems. However, purely data-driven models may fit observed data very
well, but it is hard to rationalize their predictive performance and may
lead to poor generalization at a wide range of conditions. In this section,
we discuss how supervised learning and reinforcement learning creates
opportunities for predicting the evolution of nonlinear battery systems
by using domain-specific features or extracting features automatically to
strengthen synergistic integration between machine learning tools and

4.1.1. Supervised machine learning

Modern  efforts  to  predict  battery  responses  across  mechanical,
electrical, thermal, and electrochemical dimensions largely rely on su-
pervised  machine  learning.  Typically,  the  dataset  for  model  develop-
ment is split into a training set and a testing set, ensuring the model is
exposed  to  ample  data  before  validation  on  unseen  observations.

Sometimes, the training data is further partitioned into a calibration set
and  a  validation  set.  The  calibration  set  fine-tunes  model  hyper-
parameters, such as regularization strength or learning rate, enhancing
the generalization of the machine learning model to new data. Mean-
while, the validation set evaluates the model post-training, allowing us
to  identify  overfitting  or  underfitting  issues,  adjust  hyperparameters,
and make structural decisions, such as determining the number of layers
in a neural network.

In  field  applications,  the  qualification  evaluation  of  batteries  is

pivotal  for  ensuring  product  quality,  performance,  and  reliability.  A
recent  study,  which  employed  decision  trees  and  support  vector  ma-
chines,  showed  that  when  physics-based  numerical  modeling  is  com-
bined  with  machine  learning  methods,  the  feature-based  models  can
classify cells with over 95 % accuracy (voltage error <0.1 mV) into four
safety  risk  levels:  normal  cells,  defective  cells,  shorted  cells  without
potential  thermal  runaway,  and  shorted  cells  with  potential  thermal
runaway, using only 5 min of data collection prior to prediction (Fig. 9)
[146].

Internal short circuits are commonly used indicators in battery safety
assessments.  A  cell  can  develop  internal  short-circuits  due  to  various
abuse conditions, including mechanical (collision and crush), electrical
(overcharging,  over-discharging,  or  incorrect  charge/discharge  pro-
tocols), or thermal (overheating) abuses. For instance, a feature-based
supervised machine learning approach using random forest achieved a
97  %  fault  detection  accuracy  by  analyzing  charge-discharge  battery
data  before  and  after  mechanical  abuse  [147].  This  accuracy  was
attained  by  extracting  eight  features  from  the  battery  current  and
voltage  data,  which  included end-of-charge  SOC, open-circuit  voltage
(OCV) at a low SOC level, constant voltage time, energy loss, the slope of
OCV near discharge end, coefficient of SOC vs. OCV slope, and internal
resistance.  In  another  study,  a  multiclass  relevance  vector  machine
software (mRVM) was employed to diagnose internal short circuits in
batteries subjected to mechanical, electrical, and thermal abuses [148].
Four  features—SOC  deviation,  temperature  error,  terminal  voltage
error, and the correlation between charge/discharge current and inter-
nal resistance—were utilized to unearth internal short circuit patterns
concealed in the continuous space-time domain. This feature-based su-
pervised learning achieved a grade misjudgment rate of 14.59 % and a
state misjudgment rate as low as 3.13 % when diagnosing internal short
circuits across all abuse conditions.

Recently,  machine  learning,  when  combined  with  finite  element
models,  has  showcased  prowess  in  forecasting  battery  failures  and
associated safety concerns. For instance, a “safety envelope” for batte-
ries  was  devised  using  supervised  learning  models  to  assess  diverse
mechanical  loading  conditions  [63].  Classification tools  including  de-
cision  trees,  support  vector  machines,  and  artificial  neural  networks
(ANNs) are used to evaluate if specific loading scenarios might trigger an
internal short circuit. Concurrently, regression models detail parameters
such as the intrusion, force, and kinetic energy of indenters that could
lead to short circuits. In a related vein, support vector regression (SVR)
was utilized to forecast internal short circuits stemming from mechan-
ical strains [149]. This research utilized a “safety risk” metric to convey
the potential for an internal short circuit under designated mechanical
stresses,  boasting  a  test  accuracy  of  93.8  %.  Significantly,  the  repre-
sentative  volume  element  (RVE)  model  facilitates  knowledge-driven,
variable-fidelity analyses, offering insights into the evolution of inter-
nal  short circuits  over  varying  scales  while conserving  computational

resources.  The  RVE  approach  categorizes  different  cell  configurations
through  unified  representative  components,  bolstering  model  efficacy
and adaptability.

Turning to external disruptions, external short circuits are another
culprit  behind  battery  failures.  A  study  merged  an  electro-thermal
framework with ANNs to precisely determine the reaction of the bat-
tery pack to an external short, obviating the necessity for current and
temperature  monitors—a  noteworthy  breakthrough  for  EV  platforms
[150].  The  backpropagation  neural  network  (BPNN)  in  this  study  le-
verages  voltage and  current readings from compromised cells,  under-
lining the pivotal influence of precise data during its calibration phase.
Rapid charging, particularly at 4-6 C-rate, is pivotal for widespread
EV adoption. Yet, commercial high-energy lithium-ion batteries, using
graphite anodes and transition metal oxide cathodes in liquid electro-
lytes, grapple with electrochemical and safety issues during consistent
fast  charging  [151].  Charging  at  these  high  rates  intensifies  internal
polarizations,  resulting  in  Li  plating  and  heightened  heat.  The  accu-
mulated Li plating over cycles can cause lithium depletion, electrolyte
breakdown, and potential micro-shorts. In one study, 31 NMC//graphite
cells were analyzed, dividing them into training (11 cells), testing (10
cells),  and  validation  (10  cells)  sets  for  machine  learning  [152].  The
study  combined  domain  knowledge  (SEI  vs.  Li  plating)  and  electro-
chemical characteristics with an elastic-net classification framework to
determine potential cell risks. Four specific features were used for more
accurate predictions: (i) cycle-to-cycle capacity changes, (ii) same-cycle
discharge-to-charge capacity ratio, (iii) end-of-charge rest voltage, and
(iv)  post-charge  OCV  relaxation  profile.  The  research  showcased  that
with  the  right  electrochemical  markers,  Li  plating  can  be  precisely
identified within the first 25 charge-discharge cycles. In another study, a
data-model fusion approach was designed for battery fault detection by
integrating  physics  and  machine  learning  [153].  The  study  utilized  a
single particle model for electrochemical dynamics, focusing on anode
behaviors, and leveraged the energy balance principle for thermal dy-
namics  across  the  cylindrical  radius  of  the  cell.  Detection  observers,
grounded on the Lyapunov stability theory, updated in real-time using
Gaussian process regression  (GPR). The findings highlighted  that ma-
chine learning, when applied properly, can distinguish between faults
and  uncertainties  by  learning  model  intricacies  and  measurement
uncertainties.

As  highlighted  before,  abnormal  capacity  degradation  signals  po-
tential  failure  risks,  while  even  regular  degradation  presents  safety
concerns. Typically, when the capacity falls to 80 % of its initial value, it
is  marked  as  the  EOL  due  to  safety  and  reliability  considerations  in
battery systems. Hence, lifetime estimations and predictions concerning
capacity  or  cycle  life  are  tools  to  assess  battery  aging  and  anomaly
detection.  A  prominent  case  involves  early-prediction  models  that
leverage  regularization  techniques  to  forecast  the  cycle  life  of  LFP/
graphite  batteries  from  initial  voltage  curves  [52].  A  dataset  of  124

commercial  cells,  subjected  to  diverse  fast-charging  conditions
(charging rates of 4 C, 6 C, and 8 C; constant discharge at 4 C; steady
C), was produced. This was divided into a training
temperature of 30
set of 41 cells to refine model specifics and coefficients, and two testing
sets (43 and 40 cells) to evaluate the models. To broaden the features,
three models were conceived based on domain expertise: (a) capacity
variance  between  the  10th  and  100th  cycles,  (b)  added  voltage  and
current data from the initial 100 cycle discharges, and (c) further tem-
perature and resistance details. These models, although not tailored to
physico-chemical  aging  details,  accurately  predicted  and  categorized
the cycle life. Specifically, they had a 9.1 % test error for life predictions
from the first 100 cycles and a 4.9 % error when sorting cells by their
expected  lifetimes  using  just  five  cycles.  This  prediction  model  and
dataset  subsequently  aided  in  optimizing  fast-charging  protocols
(Fig.  10a),  aligning  with  a  Bayesian  optimization  approach  in  later
research  [61].  These  groundbreaking  studies  effectively  navigate  the
charging  protocol  parameters  and  offer  a  promising  approach  for
detecting  anomalous  capacity  degradation.  It  can  be  observed  that
among the tests conducted on stochastic commercial cells, there is one
anomalous cell out of 124 cells (red degradation line shown in Fig. 10b),
as well as five cells that failed either at the beginning or in the middle of
the cycling experiments out of a total of 233. This suggests that battery
anomalous lifetime degradation may be more common than we gener-
ally expect.

Besides time domain analysis, frequency domain methods, such as
EIS,  are  frequently  used  for  battery  capacity  prediction.  Specifically,
using low-frequency EIS with GPR has expedited capacity estimations
for lithium-ion batteries [154]. This technique extracts highly correlated
capacity-related features. Six health  indicators were crafted: Warburg
impedance, pseudo-Li-ion diffusion state (PLDS), signal PLDS’s residual
value  (depicting  electrode  kinetic  properties),  and  fset  (the  initial  fre-
quency with an impedance slope exceeding 0.5) alongside its real and
imaginary  parts,  which  capture  battery  impedance  degradation.  With
GPR, complex battery system behaviors were predicted, slashing 66 % of
training  data  needed  for  full  frequency  band  EIS,  thanks  to  its  easy

implementation  and  adaptive  hyper-parameter  acquisition.  Further-
more,  an  impedance  spectrum-based  prediction  method  can  train  to
predict  battery  capacity  even  under  irregular  and  previously  unen-
countered  operating  conditions  [155].  Exploring  feature  space  and
model generalization required datasets from 88 commercial lithium coin
cells, subjected to varied charging and discharging protocols. XGBoost
[156]  played  a  pivotal  role,  enhanced  for  probabilistic  forecasting,
handling uncertainty in models and predictions. The mean and standard
deviation of the estimators quantified the model performance and pre-
diction uncertainty. After extensive evaluations, EIS emerged as a robust
tool to gauge cell response across time scales, informed by future cycling
protocols  and  a  single  pre-charging  galvanostatic  EIS  spectrum.
Computational findings underscored the need for a multi-dimensional
vector to depict battery health, rather than relying solely on the tradi-
tional SOH metrics such as capacity or internal resistance.

Recent studies suggest that merging battery models with supervised
machine intelligence effectively identifies battery cell risks. However,
the  predictive  generalization  for  battery  failure  in  a  fully-supervised
context  is  challenging,  primarily  due  to  the  reliance  of  the  machine
learning model on training data and domain expertise. While feature-
based learning can pinpoint hazardous conditions, it remains sensitive
to its training set and particular abuse scenarios. Manually labeling for a
vast input domain is time-intensive, making models impractical for large
sets of unlabeled data. Furthermore, the incomplete understanding of
real-world  physics  can  add  computational  burdens  and  uncertainties.
Hence, beyond just analyzing failure and aging mechanisms, combining
multiple  models  and  exploring  varied  learning  approaches,  such  as
reinforcement,  unsupervised,  and  semi-supervised  learning,  can  offer
innovative  ways to  enhance battery  safety, further elaborated  in  sub-
sequent sections.

4.1.2. Deep reinforcement learning

Reinforcement  learning,  a  fusion  of  machine  learning  and  neuro-
scientific  approaches,  provides  a  framework  where  agents  optimize
behavior based on rewards from environment interactions [157]. Over

J. Zhao et al.

the  last  decade,  deep  learning  [40],  an  AI  subfield,  has  significantly
aided in developing more intelligent machines by utilizing multi-layered
data  processing  for  multiple  abstraction  levels  under  controlled  sce-
narios. Its widespread success has reshaped various market segments.
Combining  deep  learning  with  reinforcement  learning  leads  to  deep
reinforcement learning. This synergy is adept at reshaping the objectives
of visual comprehension and exploration based on potent representation
learning [158–160]. In this setup, the actions of an agent prompt envi-
ronment feedback based on a reward function, transitioning the envi-
ronment  state  with  certain  probability  [161].  Merging  reinforcement
learning with deep neural networks (DNN) can master numerous chal-
lenging  tasks,  aiming  to  maximize  cumulative  future  rewards  with
minimal  prior  knowledge.  Recently,  deep  reinforcement  learning  has
achieved breakthroughs in fields such as video gaming [162], nuclear
fusion [163], and stratospheric balloon navigation [164].

In deep reinforcement learning, two critical elements are the envi-
ronment and the agent. For battery PHM, such as fast-charging protocol
optimization, the agent, represented by the BMS, makes decisions (such
as the applied current) by interacting with the environment (the battery)
[165].  The  Doyle-Fuller-Newman  pseudo-two-dimensional  electro-
chemical model [166] predicts the evolution of the multi-physics battery
system,  capturing  macroscale  physics,  such  as  lithium  concentration,
electric potential, ionic current, and cell temperature. The deep deter-
ministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based reinforcement learning excels in
handling continuous state and action spaces, updating the control policy
in actor-critic network structures, thus minimizing safety hazards during
fast charging.

Given that batteries degrade and decline in performance over time, it
is pivotal to explore data-driven techniques for health-conscious battery
energy  management.  Recent  studies  suggest  that  deep  reinforcement
learning  can  achieve  this  using  time-resolved  BMS  data,  including
voltage, current, and temperature. This approach has proved promising
in predicting nonlinear battery systems, based on electrochemical model
parameter calibration [167]. Parameter calibration is seen as a tracking
challenge  modeled  by  a  Markov  decision  process  [168].  The
electrochemistry-centric model from NASA Ames Research Center [169]
significantly aids the success of reinforcement learning in this context,
capturing  the  electrochemical  dynamics  and  aging  impacts  with  a
detailed  equilibrium  potential  assessment  during  charging  and  dis-
charging. The Lyapunov-based maximum  entropy deep  reinforcement
learning trains agents to comprehend intricate electrochemical behav-
iors  through  dynamic  environment  interactions.  Comparative  studies
show  this  framework  surpasses  Kalman-based  filter  methods  in  accu-
racy,  offers  stronger  generalization  than  supervised  learning,  and
operates without relying on ground truth data.

To  optimize  battery  preventive  maintenance,  deep  reinforcement
learning  can  be  employed  for  prognostication  and  smart  health  man-
agement in continuous state-action spaces [170]. An empirical model,
based on Arrhenius kinetics, factored in variables such as average SOC,
SOC deviation, Ah charging capacity, and operating temperature. The
agent, using the Monte Carlo for post-episode updates and deep neural
networks for tree search guidance, displayed proficient and consistent
decision-making due to the approximation capability and scalability of
the networks. Additionally, models have been developed to understand
multiphysics battery systems using an electro-thermal model based on
soft  actor-critic  deep  reinforcement  learning  [171],  and  DDPG-based
methods  [172].  The  coupled  electro-thermal  model,  comprising  an
equivalent-circuit  electrical  model  and  a  thermal  one,  was  devised
considering heat generation and the temperature reliance of electrical
parameters  [173].  Such  models  adeptly  capture  cell  SOC,  terminal
voltage, surface and crucially, the core temperature, reflecting potential
failure risks. Furthermore, a cloud-based data framework offers a cus-
tomizable wireless portal, enhancing electrical and thermal safety, while
reducing energy loss and aging costs, leveraging predictive analysis of
real-world vehicle data (Fig. 11) [172].

within an actor-critic framework, the twin-delayed DDPG (TD3) algo-
rithm  was  employed  to  enable  the  intelligent  agent  to  navigate  the
continuous  control  environment  [174].  TD3  integrates  two  types  of
networks  rooted  in  the  actor-critic  architecture.  The  actor  networks
guide  deterministic  actions  based  on  input  states,  whereas  the  critic
networks  estimate  the  expected  reward  and  furnish  gradient  data  to
optimize future rewards. Simulations reveal that TD3-based reinforce-
ment  learning  effectively  curtails  operating  costs  while  prolonging
battery life, harnessing reward functions related to fuel consumption,
battery aging, and SOC maintenance [175]. It also enhances the iden-
tifiability  of  lithium-ion  battery  aging  under  varied  operating  condi-
tions,  as  evident  from  calculating  identification  errors  and  their
subsequent rewards [176].

Recent endeavors highlight the immense practical successes of deep
reinforcement learning. Yet, while celebrating these achievements, it is
vital to acknowledge their constraints. Progressing towards a real-world
problem-solving tool, especially for challenges laden with incomplete or
uncertain  parameters,  necessitates  dedicated  research.  The  aim?  To
conceive a learning system adept at discerning objects and rationalizing
systematically  over  vast  spatial  and  temporal  expanses.  Particularly
concerning batteries and materials, there is room to refine the ease of
implementing reinforcement learning via neural networks. Embedding
AI  agents  with  insights  derived  from  comprehensive  physical  model
formulations  could  be  transformative,  aiding  them  in  mastering  rich
representations  and  facilitating  self-driven  planning,  reasoning,  and
exploration.

4.2. Machine learning for large datasets

For large-scale applications in electrified transportation or stationary
energy storage, thousands or even millions of cells would be connected
in  a  series-parallel  structure  for  the  requirement  to  provide  sufficient
power and energy. In this context, manually annotating such large da-
tabases  is  particularly  burdensome  and  inefficient.  A  severe  common
challenge in battery diagnosis and prognosis we face is limited labeled
data (failure or risk) and a large amount of unlabeled time-series data. In
this  context,  the  machine  learning  methods  that  have  advantages  in
learning from few annotated samples while making the best use of large-
scale uncurated datasets would likely yield the preferable result. This
section will focus on this mission using three different machine learning
methods,  as  shown  in  Fig.  12.  The  characteristics  and  merits  of  each
learning paradigm are concisely summarized in Table 3.

4.2.1. Unsupervised learning for outlier detection in battery packs

Supervised learning is a feature-based, data-driven method for pre-
dicting  battery  failures  under  abuse  conditions,  relying  heavily  on
explicit  input-output  pairs  such  as  voltage,  current,  and  temperature
matched with known outcomes — failure or safety. On the other hand,
unsupervised learning detects variations among large sample sets from a
unique  perspective,  mirroring  the  primary  way  humans  and  animals
learn. Instead of explicit instruction, we understand our surroundings
through  observation  and  inference,  identifying  underlying  patterns
without constant feedback. Dynamic clustering analysis, a popular un-
supervised learning technique, classifies observed data based on feature
distribution, revealing internal structures without labeled data. Essen-
tially, even without labeled inputs, unsupervised learning can categorize
vast, unlabeled datasets.

Outliers in data may indicate potential hazardous battery failures at
the pack level. Concentrations of outliers in a cluster can cast doubt on
other data within that cluster. This form of analysis is often termed as
outlier or anomaly mining [177]. A basic technique for outlier detection
involves  forming  cluster  nodes  by  joining  individual  nodes  so  that
observed  points  can  be  categorized.  However,  this  high-dimensional
feature  space  can  lead  to  redundant  information  and  computational
lag, termed the “dimension disaster” [178].

components  analysis  (PCA).  For  instance,  PCA-based  unsupervised
learning was used for early warning against internal short circuits by
spotting unusual voltage behavior in a battery system comprising 432
lithium-ion  cells  [179].  When  provided  with  fault-free  voltage  data,
unsupervised  learning  methods  proved  adept  at  accurate  predictions
using  Hotelling’s  T-squared  distribution  and  the  squared  prediction
error.  Further  research  revealed  that  while  linear  PCA  has  computa-
tional benefits, nonlinear PCA is especially adept at early detection of
internal short circuits due to its heightened sensitivity [180].

Another  prevalent  unsupervised  learning  algorithm  is  clustering
analysis, commonly employed for battery fault diagnosis. A study pro-
posed a hybrid model for diagnosing battery pack internal short circuits,
which used an adaptive Kalman filter algorithm for feature extraction
and  a  density-based  spatial  clustering  of  applications  with  noise
(DBSCAN)  algorithm  for  shorted  cell  detection  in  an  unsupervised
fashion  [181].  For  data  generation,  an  external  resistor-triggered  in-
ternal short circuit was simulated on a custom battery pack of 6 NCM
cells in series. This data, in conjunction with real EV data (96 cells in

series, 165 Ah capacity), was uploaded to a cloud platform. Notably, the
study  showed  that even  with missing  or sporadic  data,  a shorted  cell
could  still  be  diagnosed  promptly.  Similarly,  the  K-means  clustering
method detected anomalous voltage in battery packs under real-world
conditions.  Using  data  from  the  NDANEV-China,  a  three-tier  fault
diagnosis technique was crafted for early warning systems in EV batte-
ries, which included safety thresholds, confidence interval estimation,
and  crucially,  K-means  for  pinpointing  voltage  fluctuations.  Another
study utilized K-shape-based clustering to detect voltage anomalies in
data center batteries [182].

Thermal  anomalies,  akin  to  voltage  anomalies,  can  precipitate
catastrophic failures. A hybrid approach that melds statistical methods
with unsupervised machine learning was devised to identify these dis-
crepancies  [183].  The  t-distributed  stochastic  neighbor  embedding
(t-SNE) was utilized for dimensionality reduction, taking into account
features  such  as  voltage,  current,  and  temperature.  Subsequently,
K-means clustering was employed to scrutinize the battery pack. Aber-
rant cells were identified by leveraging the Gaussian distribution prin-
ciple and the z-score. The importance of data cleaning and preprocessing
cannot be overstated, especially when preparing sensor data for tradi-
tional  machine  learning  techniques.  Conversely,  deep  unsupervised
learning, augmented by neural PCA, has proven adept at noise filtration
[184]. Early identification of voltage and thermal anomalies at the pack
level serves as a proactive measure against potential failures and ther-
mal  runaway.  Systemically,  inconsistencies  in  capacity,  voltage,  and
internal resistance signal the risk of electrochemical failure in the bat-
tery  pack.  Modern  strides  in  unsupervised  learning  have  notably
enhanced fault detection capabilities in battery systems by pinpointing
nuanced variations in cell behavior [185–187].

While unsupervised machine learning excels at spotting outliers, it
may  not always  provide groundbreaking insights.  This stems  from its
dependency on mathematical attributes within a specified state space.
The identified features might be random and lack congruence with the

4.2.2. Semi-supervised learning for leveraging unlabeled data

While fully supervised models often require abundant labeled data
for  optimal  performance  and  generalization,  entirely  unsupervised
models  mainly  offer  numerical  outlier  detection.  In  battery  diagnosis
and prognosis, the challenges of noise and insufficient labels bridge the
gap between these two learning extremes. Integrating the strengths of
both approaches, semi-supervised machine learning emerges as a valu-
able solution in scenarios abundant with unlabeled data [188], effec-
tively harnessing the merits of its parent methods while mitigating their
drawbacks [189].

Semi-supervised learning efficiently utilizes the latent feature space
by capitalizing on vast amounts of unlabeled data, thus reducing reli-
ance on labor-intensive labeling efforts. For instance, a study employed
kernel ridge regression and transfer component analysis to craft a self-
supervised transfer learning model predicting battery health from his-
torical data [190]. The widely available NASA Ames Prognostics Center
of Excellence (PCoE) battery dataset [191] was partitioned into training
(cycles 20 to 60) and testing sets (cycle 61 onwards). Proving its efficacy,
the semi-supervised model excelled in predicting situations with scarce
labeled  historical  data  and  a  wealth  of  unlabeled  future  data.  This
multi-model fusion strategy presents transfer component analysis as a
promising  technique  for  domain  adaptation  in  a  reproducing  kernel
Hilbert space, utilizing maximum mean discrepancy [192]. Especially as
battery  degradation  patterns  evolve  over  charging-discharging  cycles,
transfer component analysis adeptly manages noisy data by refining and
discerning latent spaces, aligning marginal distributions between source
and target domains. In this context, the semi-supervised transfer algo-
rithm reached a mere 2.5 % test error for SOH estimation, despite the
training data comprising just about 35 % of the total dataset.

Another  approach  that  melds  multiple  models  for  battery  health
prediction  employs  active  learning  combined  with  semi-supervised
learning  [193].  From  the  domain  knowledge  of  lithium-ion  batteries,
four  features  were  derived  using  constant  current-constant  voltage
(CC-CV) cycling data: Ah ratio of Ccc to Ccv, capacity loss rate, voltage
at 50 % of Cnom, and internal resistance. The Thevenin model facilitated
the prediction of the polarization resistance and capacitance of the cell,
ensuring  dynamic  adaptability  and  computational  efficiency.  The
locally linear reconstruction (LLR) method with Gaussian regularization
[194] was used to ascertain the capacity distributions of unlabeled data.
Additionally,  the  semi-supervised  extension  of  the  kernel  algorithm,
transductive SVR, effectively utilized unlabeled data by mapping sam-
ples into a higher-dimensional space to address nonlinearities. The re-
sults  demonstrated  that incorporating active  learning,  specifically the
LLR (Label Learning Rate), into the semi-supervised model effectively
reduced the expected error and estimation risk. This improvement can
be attributed to the ability of the active learner to select and incorporate
data during the training process.

Furthermore,  semi-supervised  learning  complements  solutions  for
real-world  battery  challenges  by  combining  sparse  labeled  data  with
abundant  unlabeled  data.  A  pertinent  example  is  a  hybrid  machine
learning framework (Fig. 13) designed for large-scale EV battery pack
failure  prediction  [195].  The  study  demonstrated
that  while
physics-guided  supervised  learning  can  detect  electrochemical  failure
indicators, unsupervised learning aids in classifying faulty and normal
cells.  Yet,  due  to  the  intricate  failure  mechanisms  and  insufficient
training data, neither method alone guarantees accurate, generalizable
predictions.  To  counter  this,  a  disagreement-based  semi-supervised
learning method [196] was introduced, predicting failures even before
they become discernible to solely supervised or unsupervised models. In
this  semi-supervised  approach,  both  labeled  and  unlabeled  data  are
crucial for determining the parameters and structures of foundational

and elastic net), thereby enhancing battery safety tools for both classi-
fication and regression tasks.

such cases, unlabeled/unannotated samples can be leveraged to build
self-supervised models in learning the underlying properties of certain
types of data by the process of automatic labelling.

Semi-supervised  learning  provides  an  avenue  for  dealing  with  the
situation where labeled data is scarce, but unlabeled data is sufficient.
However, there are still a series of questions that naturally arise: can
they very well handle imbalanced data distribution? How to learn from
noisy  labels  to  combat  overfitting?  How  many  training  samples  are
needed to avoid causing performance degeneration? Although currently
there  are  no  rule-of-thumb  guidelines  that  could  provide  sustainable
solutions to these questions, recent advancements in multi-model fusion
approaches have the potential in improving the robustness and gener-
alization  of  semi-supervised  learning  by  combining  machine  learning
with statistics and physical models.

4.2.3. Self-supervised learning for large-scale time series data

Self-supervised  learning  has  achieved  extraordinary  worldwide
success in both academic [197–199] and commercial fields [200,201].
Compared  with  traditional  unsupervised  learning  through  dynamic
clustering  and  dimensionality  reduction,  self-supervised  learning  is
capable of learning meaningful data representations relying on the in-
puts  and  inter-sample  relations  without  human  annotations  [202].
Self-supervised learning has achieved results far beyond conventional
supervised  learning  in  both  natural  language  processing  (NLP)  [203]
and computer vision (CV) [204]. The ability for physical property pre-
diction of self-supervised learning is of great importance to the scientific
and engineering community, especially for predicting molecular prop-
erties  and  structural  analysis  in  chemical  engineering  [205–207].  In

The recent rise of Transformer networks showcases a new learning
philosophy  for  self-supervised  learning  [208].  These  state-of-the-art
neural  networks  have  excelled  across  domains,  from  language  repre-
sentation [209] to image recognition [210], audio classification [211],
and  biological  sequence  design  [212].  Their  efficacy  has  caught  the
attention  of  the  time  series  community  [213,214].  Thanks  to  their
self-attention mechanism and positional encoding, Transformers adeptly
capture both short and long-range sequence interactions, making them
promising  for  time  series  forecasting.  Recently,  Transformer-based
models  have  demonstrated  remarkable  power  in  capturing  complex
electrochemical dynamics and evolution within batteries. Specifically,
spatial-temporal  self-attention  Transformer  networks,  termed  Bidirec-
tional  Encoder  Representations  from  Transformers  for  Batteries
(BERTtery)  [215–217],  have  emerged  as  potent  tools.  They  adeptly
capture long-range spatio-temporal features in battery systems by uti-
lizing both positional and operational embeddings, combined with dual
encoders:  channel-wise  and  temporal-wise  (Fig.  14).  Within  our
research framework, specialized Transformer neural networks tap into
an expansive pool of unlabeled data. This grants them the capability to
discern a myriad of faults and failure patterns. Having embedded this
foundational knowledge into the networks, our next strategic move in-
volves  their  fine-tuning.  The  aim  here  is  to  derive  personalized,
real-time  safety  predictions,  anchored  by  authentic  field  data.  The
distinct advantage of the self-attention mechanism becomes evident in
its  adeptness  at  detecting  precursory  signals.  It  does  so  uniformly,

navigating  diverse  temporal  dimensions  and  a  range  of  operational
contexts.  The  self-attention  methodology  accentuates  key  attention
patterns, judiciously optimizing input throughput in subsequent layers,
and  showcases  proficiency  in  accommodating  extended  input  se-
quences. Further enriching our toolkit, the two-tower architecture excels
in  extrapolating  the  progression  of  a  battery  system  throughout  its
functional  lifespan.  This  advancement  notably  heightens  the  pace  at
which we can process long-sequence predictions.

In another study, with just a brief window of voltage vs. current data,
these models have forecasted full voltage discharge curves across varied
operating conditions [218]. Their encoder-decoder architecture distin-
guishes different aging states, where the encoder extracts physics-based
information, and the decoder predicts end-of-discharge. Notably, there

was a strong correlation between the latent representation sourced from
the encoder and degradation parameters based on empirical insights and
mathematical  algorithm  verification.  The  high-fidelity,  prognostic
model package developed by NASA Ames Research Center [219], which
produces  simulated  charging-discharging  data  grounded  in  electro-
chemical  battery  aging  models  [169],  was  utilized  to  overcome  data
limitations. Specific attention to physics and electrochemistry enabled
for  batteries.  Leveraging
accurate  end-of-discharge  predictions
pre-trained models on synthetic data alongside transfer learning accel-
erated training and fine-tuned the adaptation to real battery data from
NASA Ames tests [191]. The Dynaformer network architecture offers a
versatile tool for learning intricate battery dynamics with minimal real
data.  Evidence  suggests  Transformers  hold  promise  for  battery  RUL

predictions [220]. Yet, sensor data noise can affect model performance.
Integrating  denoising  auto-encoders  with  Transformer  networks
addressed  this,  enhancing  robustness  in  representation  learning  from
corrupted inputs [221]. This combined system, due to its streamlined
implementation,  offers  flexibility  when  confronting  real-world  chal-
lenges with noisy data.

Considering  the  potential  stakes  caused  by  overcharging  or  over-
discharging abuse, accurate prediction of battery SOC is indispensable
for battery monitoring and management. Recent research demonstrated
that  it  is  possible  to  achieve  an  accurate  SOC  estimation  without
requiring  feature  engineering  or  adaptive  filtering  using  only  the
encoder networks in the Transformer architecture [222]. To implement
the Transformer efficiently, the study demonstrated that it is advanta-
geous to involve an unsupervised learning component in the pre-training
phase [223]. Such a learning process used as a regularization scheme by
minimizing variance, introducing inductive bias and restricting the re-
gions of parameter space, allows the Transformer model to generalize
well for new samples [224]. Another example of using the Transformer
for battery SOC estimation is a hybrid method comprising immersion
and  invariance  adaptive  observer  [225].  The  encoder-decoder  con-
struction  is  capable  of  predicting  SOC  with  the  sequence  of  current,
voltage, and temperature data as inputs, while an adaptive observer was
applied to suppress the bursting oscillations for producing robust and
stable predictions.

The advancement in the prediction of battery states (SOC, SOH, RUL,
etc.) facing data-intensive problems greatly improve battery safe oper-
ation and protection from abuse. However, note that hyper-parameters
may greatly affect generalization in the diagnosis of the risk of battery
failure. In field applications such as an EV, every battery pack consists of
hundreds/thousands of cells and every cell contains multivariate long
sequences of time-series data, each of which may contain valuable in-
formation on cell behaviours. Close attention should be paid to the set of
hyper-parameters for the Transformer networks, including input-output
units,  encoder-decoder  dimension/architecture,  length  of  the  sliding
window, batch size and training epochs.

As  mentioned  earlier,  X-ray  tomography  is  a  cost-effective  and
straightforward  method  for  observing  battery  microstructures  and  in
operando evolution beyond just state prediction. However, the observer-
dependent  nature  of  image  quality  assessment  can  lead  to  in-
consistencies,  introducing  uncertainties  in  segmentation  from  distor-
tions such as blur, noise, and ring artifacts found in tomographic images.
A recent study showcased how self-supervised learning can significantly
enhance image quality and outperform current image assessment tech-
niques in segmentation accuracy [226]. In this context, D-linkNet [227],
which  incorporates  a  hierarchical  encoder-decoder  architecture  and
dilated convolution layers, was employed for segmentation prediction.
Training convolutional neural networks (CNN) on tomographic images
is crucial for annotating distorted images due to its innate ability to learn
from grid-like topology data. The research used reference and distorted
tomography  images  from  11  distinct  battery  types,  revealing  that
self-supervised learning, even with limited annotations for training, is
adept at ranking images.

More recently, self-supervised learning offers a dynamic avenue for
ongoing innovations in battery technologies by harnessing continuous
data streams. Despite the rapid generation of data in high-throughput
computing environments, our capacity to effectively process it remains
limited [139]. Large companies such as Bosch [228], Panasonic [229],
and  Huawei  [230]  have  developed  cloud-based  solutions  for  EV
manufacturing, also known as software as a service (SaaS), to address
battery safety and aging issues. Such digital solutions hint at the trans-
formative potential of self-supervised learning to enhance data assimi-
lation and remote diagnosis. This learning method efficiently extracts
critical global information from vast data volumes, especially beneficial
for  analyzing  lengthy  time-series  sensor  data  sequences.  However,
challenges  persist.  Self-supervised  learning  from  extensive  unlabeled
data  with  variable  scales  grapples  with  efficient  training,  robustness

against non-IID data, and continuous learning without forgetting [231].
These issues resonate with a broader machine learning area: continual
lifelong  learning  [232].  Solutions  demand  research  into  mitigating
catastrophic forgetting from non-stationary data distributions, extract-
ing knowledge from experiences, and refining self-supervised learning
approaches  for  continuous  improvement  [233].  Yet,  self-supervised
learning  possesses  inherent  advantages.  In  battery  health  diagnosis,
while procuring labeled data for machine learning models is expensive
and time-intensive, vast amounts of unlabeled battery data reside in the
cloud. The potential of self-supervised learning to process this without
explicit  annotations  by  engineers  can  usher  in  unparalleled  advance-
ments  in  lifelong  monitoring  and  diagnosis  of  multiscale  and  multi-
physics battery systems.

4.3. Machine learning applied to limited annotated data

Machine  learning  has  emerged  as  a  promising  way  to  predict  the
evolution of nonlinear multiphysics systems. However, relevant training
data play a pivotal role in machine learning modelling. To the best of our
knowledge, there is as yet no efficient and effective method to generate
sufficient,  realistic  high-resolution  data  in  the  case  of  battery  failure.
The machine learning techniques with good generalization in the small
data regime, therefore, are more favorable and may have the potential to
achieve the goal of accurate prediction of battery health and failure. To
this end, two strategies are discussed in this section (Fig. 15): (i) solving
few-shot problems using transfer learning or generative models and so
on, and (ii) embedding physics in machine learning — that is, physics-
informed machine learning.

4.3.1. Few-shot learning from small datasets

Humans have a remarkable ability to think and act, especially given
very small amounts of information available [234]. However, although
deep learning has been successful in a variety of domains, data are the
critical inputs of machine learning techniques to make predictions and
take decisions. To ameliorate the hurdles, few-shot learning (generally
less than 5) has started to get a lot of attention in the past few years
[235]. Since then, a wealth of machine learning techniques have been
proposed to tackle the challenge of the prediction tasks in a few-shot
fashion  (Table  4),  including  transfer  learning  [236–238],  generative
modelling [239,240], embedding learning [241,242], and meta learning
[243,244].

4.3.1.1. Transfer  learning. Transfer  learning  provides  pragmatic  tools
on how to deal with few-shot learning tasks, as discussed earlier. In such
cases, transfer learning is applied to learn and transfer knowledge be-
tween task domains in an effective transfer mechanism [245], which can
alleviate many expensive data labeling works by using only a few target
training samples based on fine-tuning the pre-trained models. A recent
representative  example  reflecting  this  learning  philosophy  is  the
personalized  prediction  of  battery  health  status  based  on  a  transfer
learning framework comprised of an offline pre-training model and an
online transfer model [246]. A comprehensive dataset consisting of 77
commercial lithium-ion batteries with over 140000 widely varying cy-
cles was generated to train and verify the performance of the transfer
learning.  The  deep  transfer  learning  approach  consists  of  a  convolu-
tional  module,  a  recurrent  module  and  two  fully  connected  modules,
which  were  able  to  capture  the  implicit  relationship  between  charge
curves and health status for LFP/graphite cells offline. Specifically, the
convolutional module was employed to perform feature extraction se-
lection automatically from the four feature curves (charge voltage curve,
charge  capacity  curve,  the  difference  of  the  charge  voltage  curve  be-
tween each cycle and the 10th cycle, and the difference of the charge
capacity curve  between each cycle and  the 10th cycle), the recurrent
module was used to learn the cycle-to-cycle discharge variabilities using
two long short-term memory (LSTM) layers and the two fully connected

modules  were  designed  for  the  estimation  and  prediction  tasks,
respectively.  The  online  model  provides  powerful  tools  to  real-time
predict  the  SOH  (Ah  capacity)  and  RUL  (cycle  lives)  at  any  cycle  of
the  different  discharge  protocols  by  fine-tuning  the  specific  recurrent
network  layers  dynamically  while  fixing  the  other  modules.  Further,
another  two  open  datasets  from  Sandia  National  Laboratories  (SNL)
[247] and Toyota Research Institute (TRI) [52] are adopted to investi-
gate  the  possibility  of  customizing  personalized  health  condition  pre-
diction under different operating conditions (charge-discharge protocols
and  ambient
temperatures)  and  different  battery  chemistry
(NMC//graphite).

A  similar  example  using  transfer  learning  is  battery  capacity

estimation  from  voltage  relaxation  [248].  The  data-driven  modelling
includes  three  groups  of  experimental  datasets  cycled  under  varying
conditions, in which one dataset (NCA-type cells) was applied to train
and test the base model, the other two datasets with different chemis-
tries  (NCM  and  NCM//NCA  composites)  were  used  for  assessing  and
improving the generalization performance of the transfer learning. The
cross-validation using the XGBoost method exhibited that the best esti-
mation result for the base model can be achieved using a combination of
three features, including variance, skewness and maxima of the voltage
relaxation curves. Two transfer learning strategies (XGBoost and SVR)
were  proposed  to  learn  the  operators  that  describe  degradation  phe-
nomena, by adding linear transformation layers with a set of trainable

weights  before  the  output  of  capacity  and  before  the  base  model,
respectively to adapt the input features, while the weights of all other
layers are frozen.

Collectively, the results from these tasks demonstrate that combining
deep  transfer  learning  approaches  with  domain-specific  features  are
particularly effective in the prediction of unseen examples on the target
domain by the construction of flexible, extensible network architecture.
In another study, it was demonstrated that by featuring small portions of
the charging curves to form the model input, transfer learning can solve
physical problems with missing and gappy data, such as entire charging
curves estimation using low-fidelity data [249]. The results so far show
the capability of DNN, if properly formulated and delineated, to project
complete charging curves with 30 points collected in less than 10 min of
constant-current  charging  data,  even  for  a  different  but  lithium-rich
electrode  chemistry.  This  work  highlights  the  remarkable  power  of
transfer learning in achieving accurate interpolation between the dots
and meanwhile retaining high-dimensional characteristics for a specific
multiphysics problem, given sufficient training data to cover the domain
of the learning task. Additional efforts on data-driven battery research
proved  the  trainability  and  generalizability  of  transfer  learning,
including materials properties prediction [250], battery state-of-charge
estimation [251] and battery calendar health prognostics [252]. More
detailed battery degradation behaviours and transferable deep networks
that are truly involved in the above-mentioned studies may need to be
revisited.

Transfer  learning has  been  successfully used  to extract  knowledge
from massive amounts of multi-fidelity observational/experimental data
and  identify  widely  applicable  input  features  for  transferability  in
building new predictive tools, which paves a new way forward for re-
searchers  to  predict  the  behaviours  of  complex  battery  systems  using
only small but realistic datasets from field applications. Except for the
above-mentioned  open-accessed  datasets  (TRI  [52],  University  of
Cambridge  [155],  NASA  [191],  and  SNL  [247]),  there  are  many
different options from various institutions to choose for the data-driven
modelling of lithium-ion batteries, in terms of a battery safety/failure
dataset from National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) [253] and
health/cycling datasets from University of Oxford [254], University of
California, Berkeley [255], University College London [256], University
of Maryland [257], Purdue University [258], RWTH Aachen University
[259],  Karlsruhe  Institute  of  Technology  [260],  and  Xi’an  Jiaotong
University [261].

Those openly shared datasets can be of great value in the PHM of
lithium-ion  batteries.  However,  although  the  computational  results
suggest that transfer learning is effective for knowledge transfer without
a significant number of manual-labeling efforts, the application of the
method to more complicated operating conditions for predicting battery
failure and health conditions using such datasets of different capacities,
chemistries  and  cell  assembly  remains  challenging.  Recent  de-
velopments in transfer learning enhance generalizability and flexibility
on a variety of unseen usage protocols and cell chemistries in the tasks of
battery health prediction, but most knowledge or model transfer focus
on ‘health’ batteries under constant-current cycling test instead of faulty
or problematic cells under dynamic, stochastic loading patterns with or
without  abuse  that  has  often  happened  in  real-world  applications.
Transferring the evolution of the risk of hazardous battery failure for
real-life applications are either difficult or failure, owing to the noisy
data, dynamic operating conditions, diverse failure and aging mecha-
nisms, and significant cell-to-cell variations. Solving such problems re-
quires  not  only  deep  investigation  of  failure  mechanisms,  but  also
meticulous formulations, exploration of intrinsic variables and learning
from the sparse data to produce rich representations. Moreover, there is
a need for developing advanced frameworks and new mathematics to
bring together the key learnings, thoughts and harvests from aspects of
physical mechanism, domain knowledge and machine learning.

4.3.1.2. Generative  learning. Modeling  high-dimensional  probability
distributions  in  multiscale  and  multivariate  systems  is  an  unresolved
scientific  challenge,  made  even  more  daunting  in  data-sparse  engi-
neering applications. Two leading methods in generative modeling are
the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) [262] and the Generative Adversa-
rial Network (GAN) [263]. Here, we focus on GANs and their potential in
battery  PHM.  Since  their  introduction  by  Goodfellow  in  2014  [264],
GANs  have  demonstrated exceptional  prowess  in  learning  data distri-
butions through unsupervised or semi-supervised methods [265]. GANs
consist  of  two  models:  a  generator,  which  creates  samples,  and  a
discriminator,  which  determines  if  those  samples  are  real  or  fake.
Throughout  training,  the  generator  aims  to  deceive  the  discriminator
using a reward-punishment mechanism. As the GAN optimizes itself to
reach  a  Nash  equilibrium  between  these  adversarial  networks,  the
generator

GANs  have  garnered  significant  academic  interest,  recognized  as
potent techniques for inverse design and target property sample gener-
ation in fields such as image-recognition [266], chemical biology [267],
and  molecular/materials  science  [268].  For  instance,  deep  convolu-
tional  generative  adversarial  networks  (DC-GAN)  have  been  used  to
produce representative three-phase microstructural data for lithium-ion
battery cathodes and solid oxide fuel cell anodes [269]. Analyses reveal
that generated data aligns well with actual data, emphasizing the appeal
of GAN to the electrochemical modeling sector. Given 2D images, GAN
has proven effective in expanding to 3D image data [270], allowing for
the visualization of 3D media from 2D micrographs. One application,
SliceGAN,  creates  high-fidelity  3D  datasets  by  introducing  a  slicing
process during data generation.

Battery properties and behaviors are closely linked to their micro-
structure, making 3D microstructural characterization crucial for eval-
uating  electrochemical  systems.  Generating  realistic  samples  helps
tackle the data-driven battery safety assessment challenge by providing
access to abundant, high-quality failure data. At the microscopic level,
stress and strain, often associated with topological defects, can signifi-
cantly impact nanomaterial properties [271] and might induce failures
in lithium-ion battery systems [272]. Addressing this, researchers used a
conditional  generative  adversarial  neural  network  (cGAN)  to  forecast
stress  and  strain  fields  from  material  microstructures,  using  labels  as
constraints  [273].  This  technique  translates  composite  geometries  to
mechanical  fields,  bridging  material  microstructure  geometry  and
physical performance.

Additionally,  GAN-based  methods  excel  in  super-resolving  micro-
scopy images, aiding in crack detection in aging cathode particles [274].
Such  deep  generative  learning  tools  provide  insights  into  battery  cell
degradation and performance. The results indicate the potential of the
GAN  model,  when  correctly  designed,  to  study  crack  development  in
aged  NMC  particles  in  Li-ion  batteries.  These  advancements  could
significantly benefit battery PHM in both value and potential.

In recent years, GAN-based models have gained traction in battery
health diagnosis at the cell level. Leveraging the interpretive represen-
tation learning of information maximizing generative adversarial net-
works  (infoGAN)  [275],
latent  variables  encapsulating  battery
characteristics  were  extracted  from  unlabeled  data  in  a  wholly  unsu-
pervised fashion, using the variational evidence lower bound [276]. The
research demonstrated that by modeling the generator distribution to
mirror  the  real  data  distribution,  interpretable  parameters  spanning
charging and discharging cycles, both with direct current and without
relaxation, could be extracted. These latent variables enabled the GPR to
estimate  the  discharge  capacity  of  perturbed  samples  swiftly  and
accurately.

While  cycle  life  captures  battery  degradation  through  repeated
charging  and  discharging,  calendar  life  quantifies  degradation  over
time. The capacity to model intricate data distributions empowers GANs
to  predict  calendar  aging  by  encoding  prior  knowledge  into  the  net-

Lambert-Eyring-based calendar aging model [278] with the scalability
of deep networks results in a conditional model, or cGAN [279]. This
model, conditioned on prior knowledge such as SOC drift and reversible
capacity  losses,  offers  tighter  theoretical  constraints  and  enhanced
predictions.

Additionally,  a  convolutional  recurrent  generative  adversarial
network (CR-GAN) has been crafted to produce time-series battery data
for  RUL  estimation  [280].  This  generator,  a  fusion  model  with  dual
channels,  adeptly  tracks  the  progression  of  a  multivariate  time-series
system  both  spatially  and  temporally,  courtesy  of  its  combined  CNN
and LSTM architecture. While the CNN layers pinpoint spatial sequence
features, the LSTM layers decipher temporal correlations between past
and future data. This time-series data is then assessed by the discrimi-
nator  against  real  battery  data  from  the  NASA  Prognostics  Center  of
Excellence  (PCoE)  [191].  The  ongoing  interaction  between  generator
and  discriminator  results  in  highly  realistic  temporal  sequences.
Notably,  integrating  this  generated  data  into  RUL  estimation  models
yields predictions surpassing those trained solely on limited real battery
data, offering a substantial efficiency boost in generating EOL cycling
data.

Generating data for battery cells is comparatively straightforward,
but lab tests on commercial battery packs present greater challenges. To
address  this,  a  GAN  model  was  crafted  to  generate  synthetic  data
capturing  the  consistency  of  battery  packs  [281].  Specifically,  GANs
were  trained  on  the  distribution  of  parameters  from  two  real  battery
packs used in actual EV contexts. Results demonstrated that the GAN
consistency model surpassed both the Copula and Gaussian distribution
models  in  terms  of  individual  metrics  (capacity,  SOC,  and  internal
resistance) and their correlations. The streamlined structure of the GAN
consistency  model  suits  embedded  systems  with  computational  and
memory constraints, underscoring its potential for AI-powered BMS.

GANs, through adversarial training with limited examples and data
selection, have emerged as a potent data augmentation method in ma-
terials  science,  especially  for  problems  of  inverse  design.  Yet,  their
training remains a challenge. Clear strategies to bypass issues such as
mode collapse and ensure robustness are sparse. While GANs excel at
generating  battery  cycling  data based  on  estimated probability  distri-
butions, their capability to predict battery failures across varied condi-
tions,  both  normal  and  extreme,  is  largely  unproven.  Despite  their
evident  successes,  comprehending  the  root  causes  of  battery  failures
remains elusive due to the vast array of potential triggering factors, as
detailed  in  our  previous  discussions  on  battery  failure  mechanisms.
Moreover, evaluating generative models is a nuanced task. Since GANs
produce outputs they deem appropriate without targeting specific out-
comes, their learnings can yield unpredictable or suboptimal predictions
for instances outside the training set. For GAN-driven deep learning to
become  consistently  dependable,  advanced  algorithmic  tools  that
adeptly  handle training  data  and  distill relevant  high-dimensional  at-
tributes are imperative—and there is significant progress yet to be made.

4.3.1.3. Embedding learning. Several few-shot learning methods address
data  scarcity  by  embedding  samples  in  a  lower-dimensional  space,
ensuring  similar  samples  are  clustered  while  different  ones  remain
distinct. In a study, surface defects in lithium-ion batteries with stainless
steel casings were precisely detected using a triplet loss function. This
approach ensured distinct categorization in the embedding space [282].
The  defect  classification  model  consists  of  two  parts:  (i)  A
multi-exposure  structured  light  method,  which  captures  3D  target  in-
formation and mitigates reflectivity effects during image capture. (ii) A
surface  defect  classification  approach  employing  triplet  siamese  net-
works. Using a traditional CNN model for image feature extraction, the
combined  model  facilitates  knowledge  transfer  from  large  to  smaller
datasets. This is achieved by maintaining the weight parameters from
the  pre-trained  feature  extractor  and  adjusting  them  in  a  fine-tuning
phase.  The  3D  defect  point  cloud  is  then  transformed  into  grayscale,

aligning  the  source  and  domain  geometries  for  the  triplet  siamese
network.  Testing  showed  that  few-shot  learning  yielded  classification
accuracies of 88.9 %, 95.6 %, and 97.8 % for 1-shot, 5-shot, and 10-shot
respectively.  Anticipating  future  applications,  identifying  lithium-ion
battery surface defects pre-assembly for large-scale use could enhance
battery safety.

4.3.1.4. Meta  learning. Meta-learning methods excel in few-shot chal-
lenges  across  both  classification  and  regression  tasks  [283].  For
instance, a meta-learning technique was developed for predicting bat-
tery  thermal  runaway  under  electrical  abuse  (3C  fast-discharging)
[284].  Both
and
pseudo-two-dimensional (P2D) model calculated electrochemical reac-
tion heat. By incorporating a multi-physics battery model into few-shot
learning, the method encoded multimodal data into network architec-
tures, capturing both isolated and joint information. This information
was extracted from thermal infrared images and combined with voltage
and  temperature  data. The  meta-learning  structure identified  thermal
profiles using just five labeled samples, drawing on similarities between
labeled and unlabeled datasets. It considered features such as projected
charging types, charging speed, multi-step ahead thermal runaway state,
and  attention-weighted  features.  These  features  were  processed  using
cosine similarity to determine their support weight. This meta-learning
multi-modal approach mitigates data scarcity issues, and extensive tests
confirmed its efficacy in forecasting battery thermal runaway.

These  examples  underscore  the  potential  of  various  methods  to
address  the  few-shot  problem.  However,  predicting  the  behavior  of
complex multiphysics and multiscale battery systems through few-shot
techniques  still demands  further exploration. Many few-shot  methods
hinge on a lower-dimensional perspective, largely due to singular mo-
dality assumptions. Addressing intricate battery issues, such as failure
prediction, is often costly and hard to scale because failure mechanisms
span  numerous  facets.  Such  challenges  are  compounded  by  missing
critical  information  and  the  vast  parameter  space  of  battery  systems.
Furthermore,  the  robustness  of  the  few-shot  learning  is  questionable,
especially with high signal-to-noise ratios from low-end onboard sensors
in real-world scenarios. Relying heavily on minimal examples may lead
to overfitting and weak generalizability. Real-life prediction tasks, often
marked by sparse and noisy data across various modalities, necessitate
meticulous  neural  network  designs.  It  is  imperative  to  integrate  solid
theoretical  constraints  into  deep  learning,  enhancing  accuracy  and
generalizability  by  harnessing  informative  priors  in  limited-sample
research.

4.3.2. Physics-informed machine learning

Physics-informed  machine  learning,  a  relatively  new  class  of  ma-
chine learning - opens up a new world of opportunities to solve both
forward and inverse problems, especially for complex physical systems
[285]. Although physics-informed learning is not a specific solution to
few-shot problems, it offers an alternative path for training the networks
with improved generalization in the small data regime by embedding
informative priors in the form of theoretical constraints (e.g., physical
laws  and  domain  knowledge).  Such  kernel-based  or  neural
network-based  methods  help  to  predict  the  evolution  of  multiphysics
systems  thanks  to  the  introduction  of  appropriate  observational,
inductive or learning biases [286], for which prior knowledge obtained
from  mathematical,  physical,  and  engineering  sciences  play  a  critical
role in the prediction accuracy and generalization.

Recent advancements in physics-informed machine learning show its
potential  in  solving  practical  challenges  related  to  batteries.  For
instance,  a  hybrid  approach  using  physics-informed  neural  networks
(PINN) has been proposed for battery modeling and prognosis [287]. By
employing  order  reduction  methods  on  battery  models  and  incorpo-
rating  electrochemical  constraints  into  the  PINN,  researchers  from
NASA Ames Research Center achieved accurate predictions for voltage

discharge curves  and end-of-discharge (DOD) of batteries. Integrating
data  [191]  and  physics  into  recurrent  neural  networks  (RNNs),  the
model predicts the discrete state-space representation of ordinary dif-
ferential equations (ODE). It uses the Nernst and Butler-Volmer equa-
tions  to  compute  the  concentration  overpotential  and  the  surface
overpotential, respectively [288].

For  harnessing  historical data,  a  multilayer  perceptron  model was
incorporated into the hybrid network structure. This assumes a partial
understanding of the underlying physics and theoretical foundation. The
introduction  of  soft  penalty  constraints,  based  on  the  Redlich-Kister
expansion [289], aids in correcting missing physics and grasping bat-
tery dynamics that the physical model does not account for. In a similar
learning  approach  using  a
vein,  a  physics-informed  machine
multi-fidelity model was crafted for battery SOH prognostics, utilizing
open  experimental  data  from  NASA  PCoE  [191].  This  physics-based
finite  element  model  predicts  capacity  fading  under  different
discharge  rates  and  temperatures,  attributing  degradation  to  the  SEI
growth  on  anode  particle  surfaces  [290].  Using  Fick’s  law  [291]  and
Butler-Volmer kinetics [292], descriptors for the accumulated capacity
loss  due  to  molecular  fluxes  and  side  reactions  were  deduced.  The
GPR-based physics-informed learning model excels in drawing a direct
correlation  between  capacity  loss  and  SEI  thickness.  The  study
concluded  that  this  multi-fidelity  framework,  informed  by  physics
learning,  predicts  battery  health  with  high  precision,  relying  only  on
discrete data points (voltage, current, temperature) from brief segments
of the voltage curve.

PINNs have extended their utility beyond cell-level learning to infer
material properties for batteries. For instance, they have been employed
to assess the performance of the electrode-level component [293]. The
P2D  model  [294]  combined  with  a  thermal  model  [295]  captures
intricate battery dynamics, including lithium-ion concentration, electric

potential fluctuations, electrode reaction kinetics, thermal development,
and  temperature  distributions.  For  deep  learning  modeling,  extensive
data  covering  voltage,  current,  temperature,  and  internal  electro-
chemical states were generated, simulating real-world battery behaviors
[296].  The two-dimensional  grid  long short-term  memory  (2-GLSTM)
model  and  the  adaptive  moment  estimation  (Adam)  algorithm  [297]
further bolstered this effort. They facilitated the iterative prediction of
spatial-temporal-chemistry connections, ensuring better generalization,
robustness, and computational efficiency.

Moreover, PINNs have shown promise in predicting internal struc-
tures  and  defects  in  materials  [298].  A  universal  PINN  framework
(Fig.  16)  was  introduced  to  tackle  geometry  identification  problems
with uncertain geometric and material parameters in solid mechanics.
Six  specific  plane-strain  challenges  with  three  material  models  were
formulated to evaluate the capacity of PINNs to decipher various un-
known structures, including internal defects. To inversely pinpoint the
geometry of the void/inclusion, vast displacement data under varying
loadings  were  explored.  This  physics-informed  approach  blends  me-
chanical  laws  with  neural  networks,  incorporating  both  Neumann
(traction) and Dirichlet (displacement) boundary conditions. It allows
for the continuous updating of parameters defining the void/inclusion
geometry. By utilizing the Adam algorithm [297] for optimization and
initiating the model via transfer learning, the solution achieves greater
accuracy, marking a pivotal step for identifying defects during battery
manufacturing and thus enhancing battery safety.

While  physics-informed  machine  learning  has  demonstrated  its
capability in predicting battery health and deducing material properties
by melding machine learning techniques with physical models, there are
inherent  challenges  to  consider.  Applying  physics  indiscriminately  to
machine  learning  can  sometimes  yield  counterproductive  results.
Especially  in  real-world  battery  failure  scenarios,  the  foundational

5. Outlook

Recent years have witnessed significant advancements in using ma-
chine  learning,  including  deep  techniques,  for  battery  performance
modeling and forecasting. Industry 4.0 has revolutionized battery PHM
[300],  enhancing  the  reliability,  safety,  and  efficiency  of  batteries
within  EV  contexts.  However,  predicting  with  confidence  remains
elusive  due  to  uncertain  failure  and  aging  mechanisms,  varied  cell
chemistries, and diverse abuse scenarios. Perfecting intelligent machine
learning for faster training, superior generalization, and enhanced pre-
dictive  accuracy  in  real-world  applications  is  an  ongoing  challenge.
Critical  impediments  include  limited  annotated  data,  a  lack  of  stan-
dardized  predictive  models,  and  the  need  for  computational  environ-
ments  connecting  materials,  mechanisms,  and  observational  data.
Recognizing the daunting scale of the challenges and understanding how
to leverage machine intelligence to innovate non-destructive evaluation
of electrochemical systems and improve battery safety at both materials,
cell and pack levels on spatiotemporal scales suggest the need for more
insight.

5.1. Informative data

Experimental  datasets  are  invaluable  for  extracting  fault  informa-
tion,  characterizing  physical  and  chemical  processes,  and  analyzing
failure  mechanisms  under  test  conditions.  However,  real-world  chal-
lenges  such  as  unpredictable  driving  cycles,  dynamic  charging  pro-
tocols,  and  inconsistent  data  introduce  uncertainties,  reducing  the
utility of the lab dataset in analyzing real-world battery failures. Field
data, which reflect real-world conditions, are more authentic. Current
onboard  sensors,  typically  used  in  EVs  or  grid  energy  storage,  report
basic parameters such as cell voltage, current, temperature, and pack
voltage.  While  these  offer  insights  into  real-time  operations,  they  fall
short  in  accurately  monitoring  cell  states.  For  instance,  volumetric
changes  in  lithium  electrode  materials  can  cause  SEI  damage,  active
lithium loss, and increased risk of cell failure. Detecting such chemo-
mechanical  expansions  with  available  sensor  data  is  challenging.
Introducing force sensors could be pivotal in tracking these volumetric
changes  [301].  Given  the  intertwined  effects  of  chemically  induced
stress and external pressure from packaging, force sensors could offer
deeper insights into the mechanical dynamics of battery systems.

Beyond the widely used external sensors, one promising but largely
uncharted approach is to adopt optical sensor technology for internal
monitoring of cell state [302]. By embedding the microsensor in the cell,
one  can  obtain  detailed  chemical  information  on  physico-chemical
(thermodynamic  and  kinetic)  evolution  with  very  high  resolution
[303]. As illustrated in the study, internal temperature and pressure can
be deciphered to unravel the intricacies of events occurring inside the
battery.  This  allows  for  a  comprehensive  quantitative  analysis  of
chemical phenomena based on subtle changes in temperature gradients,
pressure, and strain. Adjusting fiber morphologies and wavelength shifts
enables  tracking  of  both  structural  (such  as  SEI  formation)  and  ther-
modynamic evolutions (e.g., enthalpy potential and entropy). Moreover,

investigating and monitoring the non-uniformities within a single cell
presents novel opportunities for a more precise comprehension of the
battery  system,  enhancing  safety  measures.  In  essence,  real-time  di-
agnostics of both the interior and surface of the cell, rather than relying
solely  on  a  single  measurement  point  for  each  cell,  will  significantly
advance our understanding of the multifaceted and multi-scale battery
system throughout its operational lifetime.

Notwithstanding  the  success  of  miniaturized  sensors  in  computa-
tional materials science, important caveats and weaknesses need to be
work on before their wide adoption. In the first place, enabling micro-
fluidic sensors (e.g., chalcogenide-based) with high chemical and ther-
mal  stability  without  compromising  optical  properties  in  harsh
environmental conditions (e.g., fluorine-based) is of primary importance
for  battery  application.  Accomplishing  such  a  mission  requires  a
multidisciplinary approach involving experts from fields such as pho-
tonics, materials sciences, and telecommunications.

Second place goes to the cost being used for battery monitoring in
large-scale or grid-scale applications. The gain came from probing the
informative, internal and external multi-sensor data fusion will certainly
inspire new opportunities for solving real-life battery problems, from the
quantitative  characterization  of  the  material  properties  to  the  non-
destructive operando calorimetry to the prediction of battery behaviour.

5.2. Cloud-edge synergy

Machine  learning  offers  a  means  to  decipher  observational  data,
identify high-dimensional descriptors, and tackle ill-defined problems.
However,  predicting  intricate  battery  systems—with  behaviors  influ-
enced by thermodynamics, kinetics, and electrochemistry over extensive
spatiotemporal scales—amplifies computational demands. Enter cloud
technology, an emerging solution providing vast, cost-efficient compu-
tational and  storage  realms. With the  maturation of cloud  computing
[304]  and  the  Internet  of  Things  (IoT)  [305],  big  data  accrued
throughout a system’s lifespan can be effortlessly transferred to cloud
platforms  for  in-depth  analysis  and  machine  learning  modeling.  This
approach has been validated as an effective means of enhancing scien-
tific access and catalyzing innovation [306–308]. An interactive open
science cloud platform can streamline data reuse, reduce redundancy,
promote  cross-disciplinary  collaborations,  and  boost  scientific  repro-
ducibility  [309].  However,  cloud  computing
is  not  adept  at
immediate-response  tasks,  limiting  its  efficacy  in  real-time  decision--
making.  Edge  computing  compensates  for  this  by  ensuring  rapid
response times, given its proximity to data sources [310]. Combining the
vastness of cloud computing with the agility of edge computing results in
an  edge-cloud  synergy,  magnifying  the  strengths  of  each  component
[311].  Pre-trained  models  can  bifurcate:  one  subset  for  real-time  di-
agnostics and prompt interventions, integrated into the onboard BMS
via  over-the-air  (OTA)  technology  [312];  the  other  for  preliminary
detection and risk analysis, managed on a cloud with a dynamic inter-
face. The pending challenge for experts is discerning the optimal dis-
tribution  of  tasks  between  cloud  and  edge,  ensuring  AI-driven
simulations are harnessed effectively to pinpoint subtle shifts in battery
behavior and mitigate looming risks.

5.3. Digital twins

Battery data has surged in cloud platforms, but merely outsourcing
storage  and  computation  is  insufficient.  We  need  to  integrate  this
extensive data into modeling systems for remote analysis. Digital twins,
virtual replicas of machines or systems [313], can provide insights into
complex physical system behaviors. Though lacking a singular defini-
tion, digital twins typically encompass physical entities, virtual models,
extensive data, interaction, and service [314]. Applied in areas such as
smart  manufacturing,  cyber-physical  system  construction,  and  digital
service, cloud-based digital twins have proven valuable in holistic bat-
tery  management,  spanning  material  design  to  system  optimization

J. Zhao et al.

[315].

A battery digital twin replicates its physicochemical properties and
operational  behaviors,  even  under  stress.  Constructed  from  both  on-
board  sensor  data  and  lab  tests,  this  virtual  model  offers  a  dynamic
representation  of  the  entire  battery  system.  Such  twins  simulate  real
battery behaviors, offering tools for in-depth experiments and simula-
tions. With calibration  from real-world data, they can predict battery
health and performance across various scales, aiding proactive upkeep
and fine-tuning. Moreover, digital twins can be pivotal in testing and
refining Cloud-based AI-powered BMS [316], allowing for optimization
in virtual settings before real-world application.

The  AI-powered  cloud-based  digital  solution  can  seamlessly  learn
from  the  historical  battery  data  and  generate  longitudinal  electronic
health  records  in  cyberspace.  The  cloud-edge  synergy  combined  with
digital twins constitutes abundant elements to tackle the challenges to
excavate  useful  information  and  achieve  improved  performance  and
generalizations for the prediction and optimization task of interest, such
as remote monitoring, fault diagnosis and early warning. The interaction
between the behaviour of physical entities (batteries) and virtual models
(first-principles,  atomistic,  molecular  dynamics  and  physics-based)
could  lead  to  unprecedented  qualitative  and  quantitative  progress
through the pre-processing, pre-training and calibration process.

5.4. Explainable AI

Driven  by  enhanced  computing  power,  the  availability  of  large
datasets, and open-source software, there has been enormous progress in
adopting  artificial  intelligence  and  machine  learning  for  battery
research. Machine learning approaches learn representations of data in a
non-intuitive, untraceable way. Despite some success, in practice it is
very  hard  to  explain  such  decision-making  processes.  An  emerging
paradigm fueled by a powerful sense of demand for explanation is to
improve the understanding, trust, and management of the AI system by
explaining their corresponding autonomous decisions and actions of the
past, present and future, termed eXplainable AI (XAI) [317].

Explainability in AI varies with the domain and user expectations,
making  a  single  definition  elusive.  Different  users  and  contexts  bring
unique challenges to explainable AI (XAI) [318]. A significant challenge
lies  in  finding  the  right  equilibrium  between  model  accuracy  and  its
explainability. Traditional machine learning techniques such as decision
trees and linear regression are more transparent but can struggle with
complex  tasks  characterized  by  vast  spatial  or  temporal  data.
Conversely, deep learning methods can navigate high-dimensional data
intricacies, enhancing prediction accuracy through tailored multi-layer
neural networks. Yet, their abstract multi-level structures often appear
as  a  ‘black-box’,  making  them harder  to  interpret.  This  lack  of  trans-
parency can hinder their adoption, especially in research settings that
demand observability, domain insight, and causal reasoning. In mate-
rials science, applying XAI helps unravel underlying physics and bolsters
confidence in the models [319]. If the primary goal is predictive accu-
racy,  ensuring  stakeholders’  trust  is  paramount,  regardless  of  the
complexity of the AI system. XAI is also challenged by the absence of
clear  ground-truth  labels.  Integrating  domain-specific  expertise  into
model design and decision-making is vital. Lastly, real-time data visu-
alizations from various scientific angles can promote interdisciplinary
dialogues, bridging the gap between accuracy and explainability.

5.5. Continual lifelong learning

The  drive  towards  fully  transparent  AI  models  is  paralleled  by
another  significant  paradigm:  continual  or  lifelong  machine  learning
[232]. Distinct from traditional methods, lifelong learning features three
core traits [320]: (i) unending acquisition of information, (ii) accumu-
lation and retrieval of knowledge, and (iii) knowledge transfer across
varied  tasks  and  domains.  The  flexibility  of  the  learning  mechanism

semi-supervised, and reinforcement learning [321]. Within the lifelong
learning framework, raw battery data from daily EV operations can be
easily uploaded to a cloud server. This data allows one to emulate on-
board sensor readings and predict battery performance using machine
learning models [322]. However, adopting lifelong learning introduces
challenges.  Addressing  catastrophic  forgetting  is  paramount,  as  is
leveraging prior knowledge and discerning similarities across domains
without much interference or training data. Also, while correlation does
not  imply  causation,  ensuring  the  integrity  of  previously  learned
knowledge  is  vital.  Marrying  representation  learning  with  complex
reasoning will propel the evolution of the AI system. Gleaning insights
from  biological  mechanisms  might  illuminate  the  path  to  advanced
lifelong learning machines [323]. Although training is time-intensive,
true  advancement  lies  in  consistent  learning,  knowledge  accumula-
tion,  and  generalization  via  innovative  frameworks  that  intertwine
physical models with machine learning. By leveraging lifelong learning
for defect detection in manufacturing and predicting operational states,
we can enhance battery system safety. This is achievable through a deep
understanding of multiphysics and multiscale challenges across spatio-
temporal scales, spanning materials to system levels.
