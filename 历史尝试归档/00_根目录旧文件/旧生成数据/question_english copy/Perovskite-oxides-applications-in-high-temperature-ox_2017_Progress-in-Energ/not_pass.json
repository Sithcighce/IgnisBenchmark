    "question_text": "How does the Goldschmidt tolerance factor influence the structural stability and oxygen transport properties of perovskite oxides in high-temperature energy applications like oxygen transport membranes and solid oxide fuel cells, and what are the underlying physical mechanisms governing these relationships?",
    "standard_answer": "The Goldschmidt tolerance factor (t) is a critical parameter determining the structural stability and oxygen transport properties of perovskite oxides in high-temperature energy applications. When t = 1, the perovskite adopts an ideal cubic structure where B-O-B bond angles are 180°, maximizing orbital overlap for electronic conduction via the Zener double exchange mechanism. As t deviates from 1, structural distortions occur: for t between 0.9 and 1.0, a small deformation from cubic to rhombohedral symmetry may take place, while for t between 0.75 and 0.9, a cooperative buckling of the corner-shared octahedron takes place, leading to orthorhombic distortion. These structural changes directly impact both electronic and ionic conduction mechanisms. In the orthorhombic structure, the tilting of BO6 octahedra decreases the B-O-B overlap, increasing the barrier to electronic conduction. More importantly for oxygen transport applications, structural stability provided by appropriate tolerance factors enables sustained oxygen vacancy formation and migration, which are fundamental to oxygen ionic conduction. The oxygen vacancy concentration can be adjusted by substituting ions of different valence, such as replacing La³⁺ with Sr²⁺ in La₁₋ₓSrₓBO₃₋ᵟ, creating oxygen vacancies to maintain charge neutrality. These vacancies enable oxygen ions to be selectively transported through the lattice via a hopping mechanism at elevated temperatures (>500°C), which is crucial for applications like oxygen transport membranes and solid oxide fuel cells where both structural stability and mixed ionic-electronic conductivity are essential for efficient operation.",

      "1": "In perovskite oxides, t equal 1 represents ideal cubic structure formation while its deviation from 1 indicates a mismatch between the equilibrium A-O and B-O bond lengths",
      "2": "In the orthorhombic structure, the tilting of BO6 octahedral leads to a decrease in the B-O-B overlap which provides a larger barrier to the electronic conduction along the perovskite crystal lattice",
      "3": "Oxygen vacancies are particularly important towards oxygen ionic conduction. Oxygen gas is incorporated and released from the crystal lattice of the perovskite material at the high and low oxygen chemical potential side"
