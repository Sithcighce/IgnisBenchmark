Collection efficiency

Electrostatic precipitator is the most efficient device used for the removal of fly ash particles from the flue
gases produced by coal-fired boilers in power plants. However, the fractional collection efficiency of electro-
static precipitators steeply decreases for particles smaller than 1 mm, and particles in the size range of
200(cid:1)500 nm are removed with lower collection efficiency than those outside this range. These particles are
dangerous to humans and have detrimental environmental effects, so there is a need for novel more effi-
cient technologies for their control. One of the answers to this challenge is the two-stage electrostatic pre-
cipitator, in which the electrostatic charging and precipitation processes have been separated. The PM2.5
particles (of a size < 2.5 mm) are electrically charged in a separate device (precharger) to a maximal possible
electric charge, and then precipitated in a parallel plate collector, free of corona discharge. The electric field
in the collection stage can be higher than in an electrostatic precipitator due to the lack of sharp discharge
points. A higher electric field allows an increase of the collection efficiency for PM2.5 particles. Another
solution is the agglomeration of submicron particles to form larger particles before their precipitation by a
parallel-plate collector, conventional electrostatic precipitator or any other gas cleaning device. In some of
the reviewed devices, both of these processes were combined in a single device that allowed further
increases in the collection efficiency for submicron particles. Devices of this type have been tested in a lab-
or semi-industrial scale for the removal of PM2.5 particles from flue gases or diesel engine exhausts. In this
paper, various constructions of two-stage electrostatic precipitators, comprising a precharger and/or
agglomerator in the first stage, and an electrostatic collector in the second stage, have been reviewed. Some
of these devices were able to increase the mass collection efficiency above 95% for PM2.5 particles.

1. Introduction

PIt is estimated that the global consumption of coal by the power
sector will increase over the next two decades [32]. Combustion of
pure carbon produces carbon dioxide (CO2) while combustion of
pure hydrocarbons produces carbon dioxide and water vapours
(H2O). However, fossil fuels are not pure, and contain many other

Pcompounds and impurities, which are processed at high tempera-
tures, and the combustion products are partly released to the atmo-
sphere. Sulphur compounds and mineral particles are the most
abundant impurities remaining after fossil fuel combustion. When
the combustion is incomplete, in the case of oxygen deficiency, small
amounts of carbon monoxide (CO), black carbon (BC) and unburned
hydrocarbons (HC)(cid:1)among them Volatile Organic Compounds
(VOC) and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH)(cid:1)appear in the
exhaust gases. Depending on the combustion temperature, nitrogen

Poxides (NO, NO2, N2O) can also be produced in various amounts due
to nitrogen oxidation.

PThe most abundant compounds present in the coal, which
form solid micro-particles after combustion are SiO2 (roughly 1/2
of fly ash weight), Al2O3 (1/4) and Fe2O3 (1/8). Low-percentage
compounds in these particles, which usually constitute more than
1 mg/g each, comprise oxides or chlorides of Ca, Na, Mg, K, and Ti
these com-
[51,102,113,198,223,259,311,314]. The amount of
pounds in fly ash depends on the kind of coal and the basin it
was taken from. Fly ash particles derived from the combustion of
solid fuels are usually spherical, and are mainly larger than
1 mm, with a small fraction of the mass of the submicron par-
a
ticles. However,
size < 2.5 mm), usually contain heavy metals in their structure,
of a percentage higher than in the larger particles [173,258,321].
Besides the mineral compounds, PM2.5 particles can also contain
a certain amount of black carbon (BC), toxics and carcinogens,
which are dangerous to humans and animals, and are detrimen-
tal to the environment. Sulphur in fossil fuels (coal) is converted
into sulfur dioxide (SO2) during the combustion process and
forms sulphuric acid on contact with water.

small particles, known as PM2.5 (of

PBlack Carbon (BC) is a specific kind of contaminant emitted due to
incomplete combustion of fossil fuels, mainly liquid fuels, or bio-
fuels. BC particles are the aggregates of various forms of nanopar-
ticles, usually smaller than 200 nm, containing pure carbon. BC is
distinguishable from other forms of carbon and carbon compounds
contained in the atmospheric aerosol because of specific combina-
tion of physical and chemical properties. BC is characterised by a
low solubility in water and organic solvents (including methanol
and acetone), high refractoriness, very high vaporisation temper-
ature (about 4000 K), and low chemical reactivity with other
components contained in the atmosphere. The high absorbance
of visible and IR light by the BC (the mass absorption cross sec-
tion is higher than 5 m2/g at a wavelength of 550 nm) places this
combustion product among those responsible for global warming
[31]. Because there is a lack of technologies for selective BC
removal, the BC can only be removed with other PM2.5 particles
[157].

PMany studies indicate that the toxicity of fly ash particles
increases with the decreasing particle size and increasing specific
surface area [199]. Larger particles, from 5 to 10 mm, usually miner-
als, only reach the nasopharynx, and are removed from the body in
the form of sputum or phlegm. However, submicron particles reach
lower in the respiratory tract, and damage the alveoli. For example,
a large-scale cohort study has shown a significant correlation
between the inhaled black carbon particles and the risk of asthmatic
bronchitis, hay fever or pollen allergy [64].

PThe detrimental environmental effects of fly ash particles derived
from fossil fuels manifest as a poisoning of the atmosphere, water
and soil with fine particles containing heavy metals. The impact of
submicron particles and BC on the albedo of the atmosphere and its
effect on global climate change is of minor interest. Jacobson [109]
and Hansen et al. [93] have shown that BC can absorb visible and
infrared sunlight about one third more effectively than CO2.
Although other solid particles emitted by combustion processes can
scatter the light, and thus contribute to the cooling effect, the warm-
ing effect of BC can be higher, and the amount of energy kept in the
Earth system may increase [31].

PIt is well known that submicron and nanoparticles are very
slowly precipitated in the atmosphere (weeks to months), due to
their small mass, and can migrate thousands of kilometres to the
polar and high-mountain zones. BC and other submicron particles
can also play a direct role in the melting of snow and ice in those
zones and may have an important role in ice-layer depletion,
because they can absorb a large amount of solar radiation
[5,6,246,247].

PThese environmental and health aspects have motivated exten-
sive investigations made in many labs, with the aim of developing
new methods and devices for the removal of PM2.5 particles, among
them BC produced by power plants and transport. Conventional gas
cleaning devices used in power plants and the cement industry, such
as cyclones, bag filters, granular-bed filters, scrubbers, and electro-
static precipitators, can effectively remove particles > 2.5 mm, with
a high mass collection efficiency, usually higher than 99%. However,
the collection efficiency of these devices gradually decreases with
the decreasing size of particles. Bag filters can remove PM2.5 par-
ticles with a mass collection efficiency higher than 99%, but a high
pressure drop across the filter, up to 2 kPa, increasing with filter
clogging, requires additional energy that increases the operating
costs of this type of gas cleaning system [81,245]. Besides, bag filters
operating at higher temperatures can be damaged or clogged by the
sintered particles [233,250].

PIn the case of electrostatic precipitators, which are the most com-
monly used devices in power plants, the fractional collection effi-
ciency decreases for particles < 2.5 mm, with the minimum usually
at 200(cid:1)500 nm. Particles of this size are removed with lower collec-
tion efficiency than those outside this range because they have a
lower electric charge than the larger particles. Particles smaller than
100 nm are removed with a higher collection efficiency because they
are deposited on the larger particles due to Brownian diffusion. This
effect has been proven by many experiments and numerical simula-
tions [1,2,43,96,126,206,210,278,279,313,322,324].

PThere are two possible ways to improve the performances of
electrostatic precipitators for PM2.5 particles: the separation of the
charging and precipitation processes, and/or agglomeration of the
particles, in order to increase their size before precipitation. The
devices implementing these technologies are called "two-stage elec-
trostatic precipitators". The higher collection efficiency of two-stage
electrostatic precipitators for PM2.5 particles is an effect of the high
level of the electric charge imparted to the particles in the specially
designed prechargers, and the high electric field between the elec-
trodes in the collection stage(cid:1)higher than in conventional electro-
static precipitators. The electric field between the collection
electrodes can be increased because there are no sharp discharge
points on these electrodes, which could cause spark discharge. The
electric field at the surface of the collection electrode in an electro-
static precipitator is usually lower than 5 £ 105 V/m, while in a par-
allel-plate collector it can be increased to 106 V/m.

PIn this paper, various designs and constructions of two-stage
electrostatic precipitators, with a particular focus on the precharging
and/or agglomeration stages, have been reviewed. Some of these
devices, used for the removal of particles emitted by coal fired boil-
ers or for the cleaning of diesel engine exhausts, are able to increase
the mass collection efficiency to above 95% for PM2.5 particles.

PSection 2 briefly discusses the technical aspects of the removal of
PM2.5 particle, and presents various solutions employed to achieve
that goal. In Sections 3(cid:1)5, various constructions of particle precharg-
ers, particle agglomerators, and charged particles collectors, respec-
tively, which are the parts of two-stage electrostatic precipitators,
are presented and critically discussed. In Section 6, various problems
encountered with the PM2.5 particles precipitation in semi-indus-
trial and industrial-scale installations, and the methods of their
abatement have been considered. In the same section, the practical
aspects of the problem of why some of the methods are less effec-
tive, and why some are impractical for industrial-scale applications,
are discussed.

Pefficiency of the electrostatic precipitators for PM2.5 particles is the
result of low electric charge, which submicron particles can acquire
in the corona discharge. Because of this low charge, the electric force
driving the particles towards the collection electrode is also low, and
the particles are conveyed outside the precipitator by the air flow.
Various measurements have shown that the collection efficiency for
PM2.5 particles decreases with decreasing particle size, but for par-
ticles smaller than about 0.2 mm down to 0.03 mm, the collection
efficiency increases again because small particles adhere to the
larger ones under Brownian motion, although most of these particles
are not charged [312,313]. An increase in the mean free path and
migration velocity of particles smaller than 0.2 mm, determined by
the Cunningham slip correction factor, which increases with
decreasing particle size, is the second mechanism responsible for a
higher collection efficiency for these particles. Huang and Chen
[105,106], however, discovered that particles smaller than 50 nm
can almost entirely penetrate the electrostatic precipitator.

PIn order to increase the collection efficiency of conventional gas
cleaning devices for PM2.5 particles, various constructions, which
combine different physical principles, have been developed and
investigated; in particular via employing electrostatic forces and
phenomena, [38,118,207,205,257]. The systems that combine devi-
ces of different types into a single device, or employ electrostatic
processes in other non-electrostatic gas cleaning devices are called
Hybrid systems. The following hybrid systems are the most fre-
quently investigated and presented in the literature:

P(A) Agglomerators of particles using acoustic waves or chemical pro-
cesses in order to coagulate smaller particles to the larger ones,
which can then be removed more easily by a conventional elec-
trostatic precipitator or a bag filter [10,45,86,213,215,306,
315,320,323]

P(B) Bag filters assisted by the electric field and/or electrical discharges
[7,91,52,100,156,180,225,238,239,249,255,265,273,280,289,287,
290,305]. These filters remove the electrically charged sub-
micron particles with collection efficiency higher than for
the uncharged particles because the particles are deposited
onto a fibre due to the electrostatic interaction with the
charge induced on that fibre. When the fibres are polarised
by an external electric field, the particles are deposited due
to the dielectrophoretic forces. The dust cake that builds up
on the bag filter is more porous, in the form of dendrites
that decrease the pressure drop and also reduce the rate of
an increase in the pressure drop with the growth of the cake
during the filtration process.

P(C) Cyclones with central discharge electrode [90,100,169,170,
171,174,175,179,237,256,272]. The particles
the
cyclone are charged by the gaseous ions produced by a central
corona discharge electrode, and the electrostatic forces on the
charged particles support the deposition of these particles onto
the cyclone walls. In another version, the cyclone is preceded by

entering

Pan electrostatic agglomerator used for the charging and agglom-
eration of the particles [286].

P(D) Granular-bed filters with an imposed external electric field paral-
lel or transverse to the gas flow [37,72,87,182,209,225,319]. The
electric field polarizes the beads in the granular bed, and the
dielectrophoretic and electrostatic forces drive the particles
towards the surface of these beads.

scrubbers

P(E) Electrostatic

[3,18,35,37,42,60,61,62,68(cid:1)71,92,116,
143,153,161,163,165, 184,234,235,236,251,252,254,264,285,
289,304,316]. In devices of this type, both the particles and
droplets are electrically charged, usually with opposite
polarities, and the particles are deposited onto these drop-
lets due to the Coulomb and electrostatic image forces.
P(F) Wet electrostatic precipitators [17,21,22,30,36,46,49,67,75,104,141,
142,144,177,178,183,187,206,211,212,226(cid:1)229,263,291(cid:1)293,303]
or wet electrostatic cyclones [176,217]. In wet electrostatic devi-
ces, the collection electrodes are washed with water that
removes the problems with the particles re-entrainment occur-
ring during their rapping. Additionally the back-corona dis-
charge is also eliminated.

PRegarding the electrostatic precipitators, various modifications
to the construction of the discharge and collection electrodes, the
pitch of
the emission points or interelectrode distances, and
modes of the electrodes energisation have been tested in order to
increase the collection efficiency in the PM2.5 size range [33,63,
82,94,123(cid:1)125,127(cid:1)129,155,158,200,202,218,222,268,302].
Two-
stage electrostatic precipitators, in which the process of particles
precipitation was separated from the process of their charging and
agglomeration, will be discussed in the following sections.

PA block diagram of a two-stage electrostatic precipitator is shown
in Fig. 1. A two-stage electrostatic precipitator usually comprises the
precharger stage, in which the particles are electrically charged in
the corona discharge, and the precipitation stage, in which the
charged particles are removed from the gas flow by the electric field.
A two-stage electrostatic precipitator can be placed before or instead
of the last stage of a conventional electrostatic precipitator. The con-
struction of a precharger stage can be similar to a conventional elec-
trostatic precipitator, in which the particles are charged by the ion
current, but the voltage applied to the electrodes is reduced and/or
the gas velocity is increased in order to increase the particles pene-
tration through this stage (to decrease the precipitation of these par-
ticles). However, more sophisticated prechargers, which maximise
both the particle charge and particle penetration, have also been
developed (cf. Section 3).

PIn a more complex version of the two-stage electrostatic precipi-
tator, the particles leaving the precharger flow through an additional
stage, in which they are agglomerated. The agglomeration process is
used because the larger particles can be more easily removed by the
conventional gas cleaning devices, including the electrostatic precip-
itators. This stage is called the particle agglomerator (cf. Section 4). A

Pparticle precharger can also be combined with an agglomerator. In
such devices, the processes of charging and agglomeration take place
in the same single device. Such a combined precharger-agglomerator
stage requires a smaller surface area, which is advantageous when it
is mounted in a power plant.

PThe collection stage, which is the last stage of a two-stage elec-
trostatic precipitator, is usually formed of a set of parallel plates,
with every second one maintained at a high potential, and the
remainder grounded (cf. Section 5). Because the particles leaving the
precharger and/or agglomerator stages are usually electrically
charged, no further charging of these particles in the collection stage
is necessary. In this case, the electric field between the plates
deflects the trajectories of charged particles towards one of the elec-
trodes, depending on the polarity of particle's charge and the direc-
tion of the electric field. The lack of a discharge current in the
collection stage reduces the total power consumption by this type of
precipitator. Additionally, the electric charge is not accumulated on
the collection electrode, which prevents the onset of back-corona
discharge [56(cid:1)59,110(cid:1)112,151,152,164,189(cid:1)191]. However, when
the entering particles are not charged, which is the case when a
bipolar agglomerator is used, the conventional spiked-wire vs. plate
collection electrodes have to be used for the precipitation of fly ash
particles.

PThe trajectory of a charged spherical particle in an arbitrary dis-
tributed electric field can be determined using the following Newton
differential equation:

where mp is the particle mass, w is the particle velocity, FS is the

gravitational force.

cle charge Qp and the local electric field E:

PThe first

two-stage electrostatic precipitator was probably
described by Penney [231]. In that device, the precharger consisted
of wire discharge electrodes spaced in front and parallel to circular
bar electrodes, which were grounded. The collection stage was
formed by a set of parallel plate electrodes. The collection efficiency
of that device for smoke particles was higher than 99%.

PMost two-stage electrostatic precipitators were designed for the
removal of submicron particles from the power plants or for the
removal of oil mists or fumes in a work-place. Smaller installations
are applied in air conditioning systems. With respect to the volume
flow rate of the gas, the two-stage electrostatic precipitators can
arbitrarily be categorised into three classes: lab-scale (of gas volume
flow rate < 1000 Nm3/h),
scale or pilot-scale
(103(cid:1)105 Nm3/h) and industrial scale ( > 105 Nm3/h). Some applica-
tions of two-stage electrostatic precipitators on a pilot-scale or
industrial installations are discussed in Section 6.

3. Corona particle prechargers

PA particle precharger is a device used in two-stage electrostatic
precipitators in order to provide an electric charge to particles prior
to their collection or agglomeration. In particle prechargers, simi-
larly to electrostatic precipitators, the particles are charged by their
exposure to an ion current generated by a corona discharge from a

Psharp electrode, which is maintained at a high negative potential.
The discharge electrode is usually placed midway between two par-
allel plates (in a parallel-plate ESP), or a thin wire is stretched along
the axis of a cylindrical collection electrode (tubular ESP). Negative
gaseous ions are produced by the attachment of free electrons to the
electronegative gaseous molecules, oxygen (O2) or carbon dioxide
(CO2). These ions flow towards the collection electrode, collide with
the particles conveyed by the gas, and charge these particles after
the collision. Sometimes, a high-frequency dielectric barrier dis-
charge is used for the generation of gaseous ions for the particle
charging.

PThe charging of an aerosol particle is a complex electrohydrody-
namic process, but two mechanisms of particle charging can be
distinguished:

P(1) Field charging, in which the ions are driven to a particle due to
the electrostatic force produced by an external electric field E.
The charging proceeds until this force is balanced by the Cou-
lomb repulsion force, due to an electric charge on the particle.
An increase in the charge on a spherical particle of diameter dp
is given by the following differential equation [230]:

where Qp is the charge on the particle, ni is the concentration of ions

tary charge, dp is the diameter of the spherical particle, t is the time,
and er is the dielectric constant of the particle.

PAfter an infinite period of charging, the magnitude of charge on
the particle saturates to the following value, known as the Pauthe-
nier limit [230]:

PAlthough the charging rate (4) depends on both the electric field
and the ion concentration, the magnitude of the saturation charge
(5) depends only on the electric field in the charging zone.

P(2) Diffusion charging. In diffusion charging, the charge on a particle
depends on the gas temperature T, i.e., on the mean kinetic
energy of gaseous ions (v _
i ) which collide with the particle, and
the ion concentration. The rate of charging of a spherical particle
was determined by Arendt and Kallmann [9, 297]:

where T is the absolute temperature of the gas, k is the Boltzmann's
constant, and v _
is the r.m.s. velocity of the gaseous ions, which
i
depends on the absolute gas temperature T.

PAccording to the diffusion charging mechanism, the charging rate
(6) is independent of the electric field, and only depends on the
parameters of ionised gas, i.e., the ion concentration, ion mobility
and the mean ion velocity (which is determined by the kinetic
energy of gaseous molecules given by the Maxwell-Boltzmann sta-
tistics). From Equation (6), the diffusion charging is also possible
even if there is no electric field in the charging zone.

Ppurposes, a finite period of charging within which the particle is
charged has to be assumed.

PIn practice, the sum of charges acquired by both mechanisms is
usually used for the estimation of particle charge in the transition
size range, between 100 nm and 1 mm [15,24,25,146].

PFrom Eq. (5) it can be determined that the charge on a spherical
particle of a diameter d = 10 mm, placed in an electric field of
105 V/m, is of the order of magnitude of 104e, while on a particle of
diameter of 1 mm, it is only 100e. Only one elementary charge e can
be acquired by a particle of diameter of 100 nm due to the field
charging mechanism. The electric charge on a particle of 100 nm or
smaller cannot be higher than a few elementary charges, as a result
of Eq. (7).

PBecause the collection efficiency of an electrostatic precipitator
depends on the magnitude of the electric charge on the particles, the
ion concentration and electric field have to be increased in order to
maximise the charge on large particles (> 1 mm). For small particles,
the charge can be increased by increasing the ion concentration, i.e.,
the discharge current.

PIn the following, only the field charging mechanism (5) will be
assumed for simplicity, in order to explain the phenomena observed
in the two-stage electrostatic precipitators. In that case, the surface
charge density sp on a particle is independent of the particle size:
sp 1⁄4 Qp

ɛr þ 2

1⁄4 3ɛ0E0

ð8Þ

p

PFor example, for the electric field in the charging zone, E0 = 105 V/
m, and for a conducting particle (er > > 1), the surface charge density
on a spherical particle is about sp = 2.6 £ 10¡6C/m2.

PThe following types of prechargers were developed by different

authors, and tested in two-stage electrostatic precipitator systems:

P1. Wire-plate or wire-cylinder (tubular) corona precharger [11,12,43,
44,96,103,150,231,253,295,296,310,313,326(cid:1)328]. Wire-plate
and wire-cylinder prechargers comprise a corona discharge wire
electrode placed between two parallel plates, or in the axis of a
cylinder, respectively (Fig. 2). The particles flow with a high
velocity between these electrodes and are charged by the gas-
eous ions. The length of the plate or cylinder electrodes should
be sufficiently short to avoid the precipitation of particles within
the precharger. Instead of a DC voltage, Zukeran et al. [330]
applied pulse energisation to the precharger electrodes, in order
to suppress the re-entrainment of submicron particles deposited
on the precharger electrodes.

Fig. 3. Schematic of spiked edge particle precharger.

P2. Spiked-electrode corona precharger [73,76,119,134,137,139,204,
281,300,309,331]. In such devices, flat plates or rods equipped
with spikes, placed midway between two parallel plates, and
facing up-flow and/or down-flow, or perpendicular to the gas
flow, are used as the discharge electrodes (Fig. 3). Another ver-
sion of the spiked electrode is a flat belt with spiked edges
resembling a saw-tooth [76,103,134,137,139,204,240,242,309,
331]. When both adjacent plates (these at high potential and
grounded) have the spiked edges, ions of opposite polarities are
generated from two opposite sides, which helps the bipolar
charging and agglomeration of the particles [134,137]. However,
the deposition of the particles on both plates and the contamina-
tion of these electrodes is also higher. In the following, a dis-
charge electrode with spikes at one or both of the edges of the
plate will be called the "spiked edge electrode", while that with
spikes distributed on the plate surface, the "spiked plate elec-
trode". Compared to the wire-type discharge electrodes, the
spiked electrodes provide more stable corona discharge, with
the ionisation zones fixed at precisely defined points (at the tip
of each spike).

P3. Corona-triode precharger of parallel-plate [19,101,185,196] or
tubular [13,14] geometry. The corona triode system is formed by
an extra grid electrode added between the discharge (wire or
spiked plate) and the passive grounded (plate or the inner sur-
face of cylinder) electrodes (Fig. 4). The polarity of the grid is the
same as that of the discharge electrode, but the voltage magni-
tude is reduced in order to control the charging current. Particles

Pare charged by the ion current flowing throughout the charging
zone between the grid and ground electrodes. The grid also pre-
vents the onset of back-corona discharge. The particle number
penetration through a corona triode precharger used by Bart
et al. [19] and Asbach et al. [13,14]) was very high (> 95%),
which prevented electrode contamination. The advantage of the
corona-triode prechargers is that the ion current in the charging
zone, as well as the particle's charge can be controlled by the
grid potential.

P4. Quadrupole precharger [39(cid:1)41,122,172,329,330]. A quadrupole
precharger consists of four parallel cylindrical rods arranged to
form a prism with a square base, with a wire-discharge elec-
trode placed in the centre of this arrangement (Fig. 5). The par-
ticles are charged when flowing across this electrode system.
The pipe electrodes, cooled with water, are sometimes used in
order to decrease the resistivity of deposited particles, due to
the water vapour condensation. Such a precharger is called
"quadrupole cold precharger" [39,41,122,329]. The cooled elec-
trodes allow an increase in the collection efficiency of the sys-
tem, but at the same time, the electrodes can be contaminated
faster.

P5. Dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) precharger [34,154]. This is a
device comprising two parallel plate electrodes covered with a
dielectric layer. The electrodes are energised by a high-voltage,
high-frequency generator (Fig. 6). The dielectric barriers prevent
the removal of gaseous ions from the interelectrode space
because of the repelling electric field built by the charge of ions

P6. Masuda boxer

Pdeposited on the barriers. This charge compensates the electric
field produced by the electrodes. A DBD precharger allows the
bipolar charging of particles that promotes their bipolar agglom-
eration and allows an increase in the collection efficiency. DBD
has also been used as a plasma reactor for the simultaneous
removal of particulate matter (PM), NOx and hydrocarbons
[85,261,307,308]. It was observed that the concentration of posi-
tively charged particles was higher than these charged nega-
tively in a two-stage electrostatic precipitator with DBD
precharger, in which the NaCl or DOS particles were removed.
This difference resulted from the differences in the mobility of
positive and negative gaseous ions [34]. The experiments

charger

In the
Masuda boxer precharger, a high-frequency surface discharge is
combined with a low-frequency electric field (Fig. 7). The sur-
face discharge, generated by strip electrodes embedded in
ceramic walls forming the charger channel, is used for the gas
ionisation (similar to a DBD precharger), while the low-fre-
quency electric field, produced by the additional pair of electro-
des, is used to promote the oscillatory motion of these particles.
The particles flowing through the precharger are charged by the
gaseous ions, without their precipitation on the precharger elec-
trodes and walls, because of the oscillatory motion of these par-
ticles in the alternating electric field. This type of device is
particularly suitable for the charging of fly ash particles of high
resistivity ( > 109 Vm). The charge on these particles is higher
than that obtained in a DC corona precharger, even for a high
gas velocity (15 m/s).

[186,188,193(cid:1)195,197,318].

P7. Dual-corona precharger [4,114,117,119,121,178,260]. The con-
struction of this type of precharger is based on the alternating
electric field charger, which is formed by two parallel sets of
spiked-plate discharge electrodes facing each other, and two
parallel grids between them (Fig. 8). The charging zone is formed
between these grids. The discharge electrodes and grids are sup-
plied by two AC high-voltage sources operating in anti-phase. In
this circuit, two voltages of opposite polarities are provided to
each pair of electrodes (the discharge electrode and adjacent
grid). The particles are charged by the ion current emitted from
the discharge electrodes which next flows between the grids
perpendicularly to the gas flow. The charge imparted to the par-
ticles within the precharger can be close to the Pauthenier limit.
Due to the alternating electric field produced between the grids,
the particles follow sine-wave trajectories, flowing through the
precharger, and the penetration of these particles through the

Pvelocities (1 m/s), the collection efficiency was higher for the
counter-flow precharger. This difference was attributed to the
ionic wind generated by the co-flow precharger, which acceler-
ated the particles towards the collector stage. In the case of co-
flow precharger, the time of precipitation of particles by the par-
allel-plate electrodes was shorter, compared to the counter-flow
precharger, and many particles could leave the precipitation
stage. For the AC energisation of the electrodes, partial agglom-
eration of particles, leading to higher collection efficiency, was
expected. However, it was reported that these results were neg-
ative, i.e., the collection efficiency of a two-stage electrostatic
precipitator with this type of precharger was lower when
energised by an AC voltage than by DC voltage applied to the
electrodes [120].

PAlthough the majority of such systems presented in the literature
are two-stage electrostatic precipitators, the multi-stage installa-
tions, in which a precharger was one of the stages, were also investi-
gated. For example, a three-stage electrostatic precipitator was
tested by Jayaram et al. [122] with the goal of fly ash particles
removal. The authors used the cooled-pipe electrodes in the pre-
charger stage in order to decrease the resistivity of fly ash particles
after water vapour condensation. In that system, with a specially-
designed precharger energised by a pulse voltage and with lime-
stone conditioning, the collection efficiency was higher by 30%,
when compared to conventional electrostatic precipitators. A three-
stage electrostatic precipitator with a quadrupole cold precharger,
i.e., with electrodes cooled with water, was also investigated by
Zukeran et al. [329]. The wire-plate electrodes, energised by a DC
voltage, were used as the fly ash precipitator in the first and third
stages, while a quadrupole precharger, energised by a DC voltage,
was used in the second stage. By cooling the precharger electrodes,
the corona discharge was stabilised, which allowed an increase in
the magnitude of the charge on nanoparticles (< 0.1 mm), and
increased the collection efficiency of the system. Chang et al. [40]
have developed a four-stage electrostatic precipitator with a quad-
rupole precharger, placed between the second and third stages of a
wire-plate electrostatic precipitator. The overall number collection
efficiency was higher than 96%, while the mass collection efficiency
was as high as 99.99%. No significant effect of the precharging of par-
ticles on the fractional collection efficiency for particles smaller than
0.1 mm was noticed in that system.

PDurham et al. [74] investigated a four-stage electrostatic precipi-
tator, which comprised two systems of DC corona prechargers and
two parallel-plate collectors in series. The system was used for the
removal of fly ash particles of high resistivity (1010 Vm). Each pre-
charger consisted of a wire discharge electrode, placed between two
grounded focusing electrodes made of pipes, and of two heated
ground electrodes mounted on the collector plates. The focusing
electrodes directed the ions to the heated pipes. With the pipes
heated to 165(cid:1)588 °C, the back-corona discharge was eliminated.
The particle penetration through this system was 31.2% when the
pipes were at a normal temperature, but decreased to 3.8%, when
the pipes were heated. Boichot et al. [26(cid:1)28] developed a coaxial
electrostatic agglomerator combined with a precipitator. The device
comprised a wire discharge electrode and a co-axial cathode mesh
through which the exhaust gas flowed to a cylindrical collector. This
device was designed for the removal of diesel exhaust particles. The
particle number concentration decreased by 87% for particles of the
mean size of 70 nm, exhaust gas flow rate of 25 kg/h and inlet parti-
cle concentration of 3 £ 107/cm3.

PA precharger used in a two-stage electrostatic precipitator should
impart as high electric charge to a particle as possible, and at the
same time, the penetration of these particles through the precharger
should be maximised. These criteria are satisfied by prechargers

Pprecharger can be higher than 80%, which is higher than for DC
corona prechargers. The energy consumption by a dual corona
precharger is lower than by a DC precharger, for the same collec-
tion efficiency for the submicron particles in a two-stage ESP
system [119,178]. The ozone production by this type of pre-
charger was also much lower than in a DC precharger [178]. This
type of precharger can operate as a unipolar or bipolar pre-
charger, depending on the circuit the electrodes are connected
to, and the type of voltage, AC or DC, applied to the electrodes
[119,260].

P8. Co- or counter-flow corona precharger [48,101,105,120]. In this
type of device, the needle or wire discharge electrodes face a
grounded mesh, palisade or ring electrode. In the device devel-
oped by Jaworek et al. [120], two parallel grid electrodes, in the
form of palisades made of rods, are placed perpendicularly to
the gas flow (Fig. 9). The rods of one of these electrodes are
equipped with spikes facing the smooth rods. The electric dis-
charge occurs between the spiked-rod grid and the opposite
grid. Depending on the ion current flow, in the same or opposite
direction to the gas flow, which depends on the orientation of
the spikes, the co- and counter-flow prechargers can be distin-
guished, respectively. Multiple sets of such electrode pairs
arranged in series, one after another, can be used in order to
increase the electric charge of the particles. The electrodes can
be energised from the AC or DC high voltage sources [120]. For a
low gas velocity (0.5 m/s), a higher charge on the particles, and a
higher collection efficiency, was obtained for the co-flow pre-
charger, energised from a DC voltage supply, but at higher

P[4,24,107,108,114,115,117,121,178,186,188,190]. The precipitation of
particles in a precharger can also be avoided by using higher gas
velocities, usually a few metres per second, but at these velocities the
residence time of the particles within the precharger is too short,
which results in a low electric charge imparted to these particles (cf.
Eqs. (4) and (6)), much smaller than predicted by Pauthenier limit (5).
PThe penetration of particles through an electrostatic precharger
depends on the mean size of the particles. Huang and Chen [105]
measured the aerosol penetration through a co-flow, spiked-belt
precharger for particles of a size from 20 nm to 10 mm, and have
shown that the particle penetration initially increases and then
decreases, with increasing particle size. The maximum particle pen-
etration was at 200 to 400 nm. Similar results were obtained by
Alonso et al. [8] and Lin et al. [178]. The penetration of nanoparticles
(20(cid:1)100 nm) through an electrostatic precipitator increased with
increasing particle size, for the entire tested size range [8]. For a
dual-corona precharger, the penetration also increased from 40 nm
to about 200 nm, but started to decrease at 200(cid:1)300 nm [178].
Measurements of the particle penetration through various types of
dual-corona particle prechargers - unipolar or bipolar, energised by
a DC or AC voltage - have been carried out by Jaworek et al. [119]
and Sobczyk et al. [260]. The particle penetration through various
types of prechargers decreased for particles larger than about
200 nm. This effect was caused by a higher electric charge acquired
by the larger particles (Eqs. (5) and (6)), which caused a larger ampli-
tude of oscillations in the AC precharger (cf. Eq. (22) in the following
section) and a stronger electrostatic force driving these particles
towards the precharger electrodes (Eq. (2)).

PVarious modes of energisation of the discharge electrodes - inter-
mittent, pulse, or AC voltages(cid:1)have been tested in order to improve
the performances of electrostatic precipitators [147,162,224,243,
267]. Voltage pulses of sufficiently high amplitude, superimposed on
a DC bias voltage, cause gas ionisation and produce ions which
charge the particles, while the constant electric field produced by a
DC voltage drives the ions and particles towards the collection elec-
trode. Using the pulse energisation, the mean magnitude of the
corona current can be controlled independently of the DC bias volt-
age, by varying the pulse frequency and its amplitude [78,147,243].
In the case of wire-plate or wire-cylinder electrode configurations,
the corona discharge is generated uniformly along the entire length
of the wire when the pulsed energisation is applied. The mean cur-
rent density in the interelectrode space is higher and the distribution
of charging current is more uniform, which allows more effective
particle charging. In two-stage electrostatic precipitators, the pulse
energisation was used in the prechargers tested by Chang et al. [40],
Zukeran et al. [330], Xu F et al. [301], Thonglek and Kiatsiriroat
[271], and in the collection stages by Masuda and Hosokawa [188],
and Jayaram et al. [122]. Short pulses are preferred in the precharger
stage because they can generate much higher electron densities, of
much higher energies than by a DC energisation, which allows the
particles to be charged to higher levels [330]. The temporarily-
increased electric field during the pulse duty time increases the
mean particle migration velocity and the cohesive forces within the
dust layer. Short pulses also prevent the development of spark dis-
charge or back-corona discharge. However, the penetration of par-
ticles through a precharger with pulse energisation was reduced by
half, which can be regarded as a disadvantage of this mode of energ-
isation [333]. The intermittent voltage, although used in the conven-
tional electrostatic precipitators, has not been tested for particle
charging in the prechargers mounted in two-stage electrostatic pre-
cipitators.

PThe precharger, in which the AC electric field has been combined
with high-frequency electric discharge is the Masuda boxer charger
(Fig. 7), and that which is combined with the pulsed electric dis-
charge is the dual-corona particle precharger (Fig. 8). In the first
case, the contamination of the ceramic insulator can be a real

Pproblem in industrial conditions due to a high gas flow rate - of the
order of magnitude of 105 m3/h or higher. Rapping or other mechani-
cal cleaning is impossible in these ceramic constructions. On the
other hand, the dual-corona particle precharger can be constructed
from only cylindrical bars [260], and such electrodes can be rapped
using the conventional techniques used in ESPs. Regarding the
energisation of the electrodes, the boxer charger requires four inde-
pendent HV power supplies, two of high frequency for gas ionisation,
and two for the production of AC electric field, which forces the
oscillatory motion of the charged particles [193(cid:1)195,197]. The dual-
corona particle precharger requires only two power supplies, which
can be standard transformers connected in anti-phase, with a diode
circuit. The mains frequency (50 or 60 Hz) is sufficient for effective
particle charging and agglomeration.

PThe charging of particle in AC corona discharge has been investi-
gated by Won and Castle [299], Bart et al. [19], Ehrlich and Melcher
[77], Jaworek and Krupa [114], Zukeran et al. [325,328], Ji et al.
[131], Lin et al. [178], and Jaworek et al. [120]. Won and Castle [299]
investigated an AC precharger/agglomerator combined with a pre-
cipitator, and Jaworek et al. [120] investigated the co- and counter-
flow corona particle prechargers energised by an AC voltage.
Although an agglomeration of particles due to the bipolar charging
of particles was expected in these prechargers, both papers con-
cluded that for the AC energisation of the electrodes, the collection
efficiency was lower than for a DC voltage. Low collection efficiency
was the effect of the neutralisation of the charges of two colliding
particles charged to opposite signs in the AC corona. The second rea-
son was a short period of particle charging, which can occur only in
the time intervals when the instant value of the supply voltage is
higher than the corona onset voltage. Ehrlich and Melcher [77] found
that for AC energisation, the migration velocity of particles was only
about 28% of that for the negative corona, causing this type of pre-
cipitator to be less efficient. The collection efficiency of a two-stage
electrostatic precipitator with the precharger energised by an AC
voltage can be similar to that obtained by the DC voltage only when
the precharger is designed as a unipolar device [119,120].

4. Electrostatic particle agglomerators

PAn agglomerator is a device in which two or more particles are
forced to collide in order to form a larger particle, or in which small
particles are collected by a larger one. Agglomeration of particles is
used because the precipitation of larger particles is easier than of
those from the submicron size range.

PFor uncharged particles, the process of agglomeration of submi-
cron particles is caused by the collision of two particles due to Brow-
nian motion. Smoluchowski has defined the Brownian coagulation
rate (in cm3/s) for two particles of diameters d1 and d2:
KBðd1; d2Þ 1⁄4 pðd1 þ d2ÞðD1 þ D2Þ
where Di is the diffusion coefficient for the i-th particle.

ð9Þ

PBrownian agglomeration is effective when the distances between
the particles are of the order of magnitude of the mean free path of
these particles. Brownian agglomeration is easier and faster for par-
ticles of different sizes, and the coagulation rate is higher for poly-
dispersed aerosols [294].

PBinary collision is the dominant process in the agglomeration of
uncharged particles of nearly equal sizes [84]. The size distribution
of particles shifts towards the larger values, so the mean size of these
particles increases, while the total number concentration of these
particles decreases as the effect of the agglomeration process.

PThe problem of agglomeration is more complex when at least one
of two colliding particles is electrically charged, because the electro-
static attraction or repulsion can be dominating, depending on the
size and charge of the particles. The electric forces are used in order
to increase the coagulation rate, to a value higher than that resulting

PThe coagulation rate is higher for the larger sum of radii of both
agglomerated particles and for larger diffusion coefficients of these
particles. The coagulation rate is also higher when the agglomerated
particles are of different sizes, which explain the prevailing number
of the particle-collector agglomerates observed in the fly ash
agglomeration.

PTwo main types of agglomeration processes can be observed in

the case of fly ash particles:

P(1) particle-particle agglomeration, when both agglomerated submi-

cron particles are of similar size,

P(2) particle-collector agglomeration, by which small (submicron)

particles adhere to a larger particle (a collector).

PWhen particles of similar size collide, the resultant particle can
form a dendrite or chain-like structure (Fig. 10a), which can collapse
to nearly spherical one when the chain exceeds a certain length.
When the large particles (5(cid:1)20 mm) are also conveyed by the flue
gas, smaller particles ( < 1 mm) preferentially adhere to the larger
ones, which act as the collectors (Fig. 10b). Several papers have
reported that particle-collector agglomeration dominates when the
size distribution of particles is bimodal [98,148,149,166,167,260,
294]. Experimental results have shown that the particle-collector
agglomeration mainly occurs for fly ash particles in all types of
agglomerators, while the particle-particle agglomeration is typical
for diesel particles, forming the particle-particle chains, which after
a certain time can contract to globular particles [99].

PChemical agglomeration [168] and acoustic agglomeration
[45,86,213,215,306, 315,320,323] are the most frequently men-
tioned non-electrostatic methods. Chemical agglomeration requires
additives which are sprayed into the exhaust gas, whereas acoustic
agglomeration is energy-consuming due to a high level of acoustic
pressure required to force the particles to the collision. This prevents
the wide application of these methods in industrial conditions. The
sound level required for effective acoustic agglomeration is of the
order of 150(cid:1)160 dB [306]. For example, the number concentrations
of particles within the size range of 0.0233(cid:1)9.32 mm was reduced
by 85.2%, and the mass concentration by 92.5%, in an agglomerator
with acoustic excitation at a frequency of 1 kHz, but the required
sound level was 161.5 dB [306]. The effective acoustic agglomeration
of submicron particles occurs only in a very narrow frequency range,
but even for an optimal frequency, not all of the agglomerates are
sufficiently coherent and stable to reach the precipitation stage
[262].

PSeveral authors have constructed and investigated electrostatic
precipitators and/or bag filters with the assistance of acoustic
for which the overall collection efficiency was
agglomeration,
increased to above 99%, but this process requires an additional
chamber for the agglomeration of particles (cf. [323]). Chen et al.
[45], for example, combined the electrostatic field with an acoustic
agglomeration for the control of fine particles. The sound frequency
was between 800 Hz and 2400 Hz, and the sound pressure was
130(cid:1)148 dB (80 W). The total particle penetration through that
agglomerator-electrostatic precipitator system was only about 4.4%.
The current-voltage characteristics of negative corona discharge
were not changed by the acoustic waves, but the trajectories of par-
ticles were distorted, which caused the collisions and agglomeration
of the particles. The efficiency of acoustic agglomeration decreased
and the optimal frequency of acoustic excitation slightly increased
with increased discharge voltage [45].

PThe agglomeration process can also be improved using water
vapour condensation [29,181,262,320]. Water can form bridges
between the particles that can stabilise the agglomerate. Due to a
high capillary pressure of the condensed water, long, chain-like
agglomerates are rearranged into compact spherical globules

P[50,201,248]. The water vapour condensation on particles has also
been combined with acoustic agglomeration [65,66], but a disadvan-
tage of the wet methods of agglomeration is that a cementing layer
can form on the electrodes and in the hopper.

PFor these reasons, the electrostatic agglomeration processes are
generally preferred in two-stage electrostatic precipitator installa-
tions.

PThe following parameters are used in order to characterise the

efficiency of the agglomeration process:

P(1) Agglomeration Ratio (AR), defined as the ratio of the number of
agglomerates NA at the agglomerator outlet to the total number
of particles at the agglomerator inlet Np [88,89]:
AR 1⁄4 NA
Np

ð16Þ
P(2) Enhancement Rate (ER), defined as the ratio of the particle num-
ber concentration at the agglomerator outlet nout to the particle
number concentration at the agglomerator inlet nin [325]:
ER 1⁄4 nout
nin

ð17Þ
P(3) Enhancement Ratio d, defined as the ratio of the median diameter
of agglomerated particles Daggl at the agglomerator outlet to the
median diameter Din of particles at the agglomerator inlet [43]:

d 1⁄4

Daggl
Din

ð18Þ

Zukeran et al. [325] have also used the Agglomeration Rate a which is
defined by the following equation:
a 1⁄4 nC þ nout

ð19Þ

nin

where nC is the number concentration of particles removed from the
gas (deposited on the collection electrode), nout is the number con-
centration of particles at the agglomerator outlet, and nin is the num-
ber concentration of particles at the agglomerator inlet.

PWhen the agglomeration rate a < 1, the number concentration of
particles decreases due to their agglomeration. Measurements indi-
cate that the agglomeration rate a increases with increasing particle
size, and it becomes a > 1 for the particles of a size between 0.2 and
0.5 mm [325]. This result means that the particles larger than a spe-
cific size are the agglomerates of primary particles smaller than this
size.

PSobczyk et al. [260] have characterised the effect of agglomera-
tion on the collection efficiency of a two-stage electrostatic precipi-
tator using the fractional Efficiency Enhancement (EE), which was
defined as the ratio of increment of the fractional collection effi-
ciency in the i-th class of the particles size after simultaneously
switching on the agglomeration and precipitation stages to the col-
lection efficiency in the same i-th class when only the electrostatic
precipitator was switched on:

where ɳALL ON(i) and ɳESP ON,AGGL.OFF(i) are the number collection effi-
ciencies in the i-th class of the particle size at the outlet of a two-
stage electrostatic precipitator, with both the electrostatic precipita-
tor and agglomerator stages switched on, and for the electrostatic
precipitator switched on and the agglomerator switched off, respec-
tively.

PBecause different measures are used by different authors, a com-
parison of the effect of the agglomeration process on the collection
efficiency of two-stage electrostatic precipitator is difficult. The
enhancement rate (17) proposed by Zukeran et al. [325] is the most
practical definition in use because it can be determined directly
from the measurements of the particle number concentration. The
enhancement ratio (18) can also be used for the estimation of

Pchanges in the mean size of particles. However, as will be shown
later in this section, the changes in the mean particle size are not
detectable by standard particle size distribution measuring devices,
and only a couple of authors have reported on this effect. The defini-
tion (16) of Gotoh and Masuda [89] is difficult to use in practice
because it would require an individual decision on whether a given
particle is an agglomerate or only a primary particle. These numbers
cannot be estimated from the measurements of particle size distri-
bution.

PDepending on the orientation of the ion current relative to the
direction of the gas flow(cid:1)perpendicular or parallel(cid:1)the cross-flow
and co- or counter-flow agglomerators can be distinguished, respec-
tively. With respect to the kind of electric charges, of one sign or
both signs, used in the agglomeration process, the electrostatic
agglomerators can be categorised into two main groups:

P(1) Bipolar agglomerators

[44,79,80,119,130,131,133,140,145,159,
160,203,299,325], in which electric charges of both signs are
used in the agglomeration process. Usually, in bipolar agglomer-
ators, the stream of particles is divided into two equal streams,
which are electrically charged to opposite polarities in two sepa-
rate prechargers, by the ion currents generated by a corona dis-
charge. In the next stage, the charged particles of opposite signs
are mixed in a DC or AC electric field, or in a turbulent flow
induced by the obstacles crossing the gas flow. The particles col-
lide due to the Coulomb attraction forces between them, and are
agglomerated. In another version of the bipolar agglomerator,
the particles are charged to opposite polarities in an AC corona
discharge [119,299,325]. Clouds of oppositely charged particles
flowing one after another attract, collide and can agglomerate.
P(2) Unipolar agglomerators [98,119(cid:1)121,145,207,260], in which all
particles are charged to the same polarity by the ion current,
and then are subjected to the oscillatory motion in an AC electric
field. The particles collide due to the difference in the mobility
between smaller and larger particles, and are agglomerated after
the collision. During their oscillatory motion, the smaller par-
ticles are scavenged by the larger ones. In another version of the
unipolar agglomerator, the particles of unipolar charge collide
after focusing their trajectories in a quadrupole, energised by an
AC voltage [40,98,214].

PThe advantage of a unipolar agglomerator, compared to a bipolar
one, is that the particles leaving the agglomerator are still electri-
cally charged and can be removed from the gas by an electric field in
a parallel-plate collector, without the need for their additional
charging. Due to the lack of discharge electrodes in a parallel-plate
collector, the particles are precipitated by the electrostatic forces
produced by an electric field between the electrodes, which reduces
the total power consumption of the precipitation system and elimi-
nates the back-corona discharge.

PIn parallel plate electrostatic agglomerators energised by an AC
voltage, the motion of a spherical particle of diameter dp charged to
a surface charge density sp, oscillating perpendicularly to the elec-
trode surface is given by the following equation:

where E = E0sin(vt) is the alternating electric field between the elec-

ing from the field charging mechanism, is given by Eq. (4), the ampli-
tude of oscillations is:

PFrom Eqs. (22) and (23), the amplitude of oscillations and the
maximum of the particle velocity component perpendicular to the
surface of the electrodes generating the AC electric field are propor-
tional to the size of particle dp. In an AC electric field, the larger par-
ticles oscillate with a larger amplitude and a higher velocity (higher
kinetic energy) than the smaller ones. These properties facilitate the
kinematic agglomeration of the particles in the agglomerators ener-
gised by an AC voltage because of the collision of larger particles
with the smaller ones, which move slower.

PEqs. (21)(cid:1)(23) are determined for the laminar flow of the gas
between the electrodes. Actually, the motion of a particle within an
electrostatic precipitator in the presence of corona discharge is a
complex electrohydrodynamic problem due to the ionic wind, which
distorts the particle trajectories, and the turbulence caused by a high
Reynolds number (in a typical ESP the Reynolds number is of the
order of 104(cid:1)105). These problems have been discussed in many
papers, both theoretical and experimental [23,82,83,205,218(cid:1)222,
241,242,282,283,288]. However, for simplicity, only the equations
for the laminar flow between the electrodes are considered. These
equations are used only to illustrate the technical problems encoun-
tered in the two-stage electrostatic precipitators. Such a simplified
approach was used for the derivation of the Deutsch equation, but it
still is used in many practical applications [266].

PThe following types of particle agglomerators were designed in
order to agglomerate fly ash or other dust particles, and were tested
on the lab-scale or in semi-industrial installations:

P1. Bipolar parallel-plate agglomerator, in which the agglomeration is
a two-step process comprising the charging of particle to oppo-
site polarities and electrostatic mixing [79,130,131,133,140,148,
149,159,160,192,200,208,269,324]. In this type of device, the
gas stream is divided into two equal streams flowing through
two parallel DC corona prechargers, where the particles are elec-
trically charged to opposite polarities. Next, the particles are
mixed and agglomerated in a DC or AC electric field produced
between two parallel-plate electrodes (Fig. 11). In the DC elec-
tric field, the particles charged to opposite signs collide and
agglomerate during their flow in the opposite direction towards
the electrodes. In the AC electric field, the particles coagulate
during their oscillatory motion due to the electrostatic attraction
between the particles charged to opposite polarities. Finally, the
agglomerated particles are removed from the gas flow by an
electrostatic precipitator or parallel plate collector. In such a
device, the number concentration of submicron particles was
reduced by about 30% (cf. [98]) or even four times (from 75% to

Fig. 12. Schematic of bipolar turbulent-mixing agglomerator.

P18% [133]). In a system investigated by Laitinen et al. [160], the
concentration of submicron particles decreased more than five
times. In another version of the bipolar agglomerator, the par-
ticles are charged bipolarly in an AC corona discharge
[103,299,325], and are then agglomerated in a DC or AC electric
field between two parallel plate electrodes. The collection effi-
ciency of an agglomerator/precipitator system was close to
100% for particles of a size larger than 1 mm, but it decreased to
10% for nanoparticles (0.03 mm) [299,325].

P2. Bipolar

turbulent-mixing agglomerator

[43,44,53(cid:1)55,95,132,
274(cid:1)279,298]. In such a device (Fig. 12), the particles are also
oppositely charged in two parallel DC corona prechargers, simi-
larly to a bipolar parallel-plate agglomerator, but are then
agglomerated in a device comprising obstacles of cylindrical or
other shapes, which induce turbulence by a high gas velocity,
about 10 m/s. The particles are agglomerated due to their colli-
sions in the turbulent flow, and due to Coulomb attraction.

P3. Unipolar parallel-plate agglomerator, in which the agglomeration
is a two-step process comprising the precharging of all particles
to the same polarity in a DC corona precharger as the first stage,
and their electrostatic mixing in the second stage, in which the
charged particles are subjected to oscillations in an alternating
electric field between two parallel plate electrodes (Fig. 13)
[16,48,97,98,145,167,207,208,270]. During their oscillatory
motion, the particles collide due to the differences in their veloc-
ities and the amplitude of their oscillations, which depend on
the particle size and charge (cf. Eqs. (22) and (23)). The larger
particles acquire a higher electric charge in the precharger (cf.
Eq. (5)) and oscillate with larger amplitude due to a larger elec-
tric force on them, while the smaller particles are charged to a
lower level or remain uncharged. Typically, the amplitude of
oscillations of a particle of a size between 0.1 mm and 1 mm is

Pones due to the induced polarisation forces. The small particles
oscillated following the acoustic pressure, while the large
charged particles were forced to the oscillatory motion by the
AC electric field. However, the authors have concluded that the
acoustic oscillations had only negligible effect on the agglomera-
tion efficiency. The concentration of submicron particles was
decreased by about 20% with a device of this type.

P5. Unipolar dual-corona precharger/agglomerator

[119,121,260].
This type of precharger/agglomerator is a single-step device, in
which the process of particles agglomeration occurs simulta-
neously with the process of particle charging. The same set of
electrodes is used for those both processes in an agglomerator
of this type (Fig. 15). The particles are charged by the ion current
generated by the corona discharge from two spiked electrodes
facing each other, which are separated by two parallel grids pro-
ducing alternating electric field in the charging zone [119,121,
260]. The oscillatory motion of the particles in the alternating
electric field between the grids promotes the collision and
agglomeration of these particles. The precharger/agglomerator
can operate either as a unipolar or bipolar device, depending on
the mode of electrode energisation. When the AC voltage is
applied to the electrodes, with a diode circuit controlling the
potential at the electrodes (cf. Fig. 15), the particles are charged
by unipolar ions. In this case, the agglomeration occurs due to
the collisions of particles resulting from the differences in their
mobility. In such a case, the charge depletion effect does occur.
However, when the diode circuit is removed, and the electrodes
are energised directly from two AC high voltage sources con-
nected in anti-phase (both grids are grounded), the bipolar ions
are injected from both opposite discharge electrodes to the
charging zone. The particles are charged to both polarities, and
are prone to bipolar agglomeration [119]. The agglomerated par-
ticles are removed by a parallel-plate collector, or by an electro-
static precipitator from the gas flow. Detailed investigations
have shown that a higher collection efficiency was obtained for
the unipolar agglomeration. The overall number collection effi-
ciency of a two-stage electrostatic precipitator was higher than
95% for PM2.5 particles, and the mass collection efficiency
was > 99% [119,260].

PA disadvantage of the unipolar agglomerator is that particles
charged to the same polarity repel each other, and their agglomera-
tion is difficult. The best agglomeration results are obtained for the
poly-disperse particles, when the mobilities of small and large par-
ticles are different (kinematic particle-collector agglomeration). In
that case, the larger particles are highly charged and collide during
their oscillatory motion with small particles, which are weakly

Pabout 10(cid:1)100 mm in the air, for 50 Hz of an AC voltage fre-
quency, but it increases to about 1 mm for 10 mm particles
[97,140]. For particles larger than 20 mm, the amplitude of oscil-
lations decreases due to increasing particle mass. In a unipolar
parallel-plate agglomerator, the number concentration of par-
ticles smaller than 1 mm decreased below 19% of its initial value
[160]. It has been noted that nanoparticles ( < 100 nm) are
agglomerated more easily than those larger than > 1 mm [160].
The size of agglomerated particles increased with the increasing
frequency of oscillations. For example, the agglomerates of a
size from 4 to 8 mm were obtained for a frequency of 50 Hz, but
the size of agglomerates increased to 30(cid:1)50 mm for 300 Hz
[145].

P4. Unipolar quadrupole agglomerator [98,214,294]. In a quadrupole
agglomerator, all particles are charged in a DC corona precharger
to the same polarity, and in the second stage they oscillate in an
alternating electric field produced between a set of four electro-
des energised by an AC voltage of a properly tuned frequency
(Fig. 14). The reduction in the concentration of particles in the
size range from 0.06 mm to 1 mm, charged to about 1 mC/kg,
was about 20%. The overall collection efficiency of a system com-
prising a quadrupole agglomerator and electrostatic precipitator
increased from 95% to 98% for particles in this size range [294].
Nakajima and Sato [214] constructed a quadrupole agglomera-
tor which comprised two rods and two parallel plates, which
was additionally assisted by acoustic excitation tuned to a fre-
quency in the range of 400 Hz to 6 kHz. In order to avoid the
charge depletion effect, only the large particles were charged.
The small uncharged particles were deposited on the charged

Pcharged or are uncharged. The agglomeration efficiency of a bipolar
agglomerator is limited due to the charge depletion effect [159,160].
This effect occurs when two particles of nearly equal charge, but of
opposite polarities, collide and their charges are neutralised after
collision. Because such agglomerates have a nearly zero net charge,
these particles cannot further participate in the process of agglomer-
ation. A similar effect can occur when several small particles are
deposited onto a larger one of opposite polarity. The charge on the
larger particle is neutralised after collision and the agglomeration
efficiency is reduced.

PMulti-step systems, comprising several chargers and agglomera-
tors arranged in series, have been tested in order to abate the charge
depletion effect [79,80,200]. In such devices, particles agglomerated
in one section flow to the next precharger and agglomerator. In a
10-stage precharger + agglomerator, the average submicron particle
concentration is decreased by about seven times. Because higher
agglomeration rates can be obtained for the bipolar asymmetric
coagulation, i.e., for larger ( > 1 mm) and smaller ( < 1 mm) particles
charged to opposite polarities, Hautanen et al. [97] proposed a
device in which the larger particles were separated from the smaller
ones by using a cyclone, and then charged oppositely and agglomer-
ated after their mixing. Although such devices can effectively
agglomerate the particles in a laboratory installation, their useful-
ness in industrial conditions is questionable.

PIn the case of unipolar agglomerators, the amplitude of oscillation
of a particle is inversely proportional to the frequency of the AC volt-
age (cf. Eq. (22)). Lower frequencies are therefore advantageous for
the process of agglomeration. Usually, a frequency in the range from
50 to 400 Hz is chosen for the unipolar agglomeration in an AC elec-
tric field [48,119,120,140,145,148,149,166,167,260]. If the frequency
is too high, the amplitude of particle oscillations decreases, and the
number of collisions between the particles moving in opposite direc-
tions is reduced, and thus the agglomeration efficiency decreases.
Kim et al. [145] have shown that the agglomeration rate did not
change significantly when the frequency increased from 50 Hz to
200 Hz, but the energy consumption increased by about four times.
Jaworek et al. [120] have shown that the collection efficiency of a
two-stage electrostatic precipitator with a unipolar precharger
decreased gradually for frequencies higher than 100 Hz. Koizumi
et al. [148,149] noticed that the agglomeration efficiency in a bipolar
agglomerator with the AC electric field is higher than in the case of
DC energisation, but at too high frequencies, the amplitude of par-
ticles oscillation becomes smaller, which reduces the number of col-
lisions between the particles. The shift between the phase of motion
of a particle and the AC electric field was considered by Lehtinen
et al. [166,167] and Kildeso et al. [140] as the main mechanism
responsible for the particles' collision and unipolar agglomeration in
the AC electric field. For the particles smaller than 5 mm, the phase
shift is close to zero, but for particles larger than 100 mm it
approaches p/2 (Kildeso et al. [140]).

PRegarding the effect of electrostatic agglomeration on the particle
size distribution, the results are contradictory, as presented by dif-
ferent authors. Some authors reported that the mean value of the
particle size increases, and the size distribution of particles shifts
towards the larger values. However, most of the investigators did
not observe such phenomena, or recorded only insignificant changes
in the size distribution, although the agglomeration process had a
significant effect on the collection efficiency. For example, Kanazawa
et al. [133] reported that the mean size of smoke particles increased
almost two times, from 0.75 mm to 1.4 mm, at the outlet of a bipolar
electrostatic agglomerator. The fractional number concentration of
submicron particles decreased from 75% to about 18%, while the
concentration of particles of a size of 1(cid:1)5 mm, increased from 25% to
82%, at the outlet of an agglomerator. Laitinen et al. [159,160]
obtained a 17(cid:1)19% reduction in the number concentration of
0.1(cid:1)1 mm droplets of vegetable oil in a bipolar parallel plate AC

Pagglomerator. The authors observed that the agglomeration effi-
ciency increased for higher concentrations of the droplets, but
started to decrease when the concentration was higher than 5*1012/
m3, probably due to the loss of droplets in the precharger and
agglomerator. In the experiments conducted by Ji et al. [130,131],
the number concentration of DOS particles larger than 3.2 mm
increased, while the concentration of smaller particles at the outlet
of a bipolar AC agglomerator decreased. The reduction of the number
concentration of particles from the size range of 0.1(cid:1)1.0 mm was
17(cid:1)19%, while the mass concentration decreased to 27%. The reduc-
tion in the number concentration slightly increased with increasing
frequency of AC voltage. Tan et al. [269], using a bipolar DC agglom-
erator (vertical configuration) with two DC corona prechargers,
obtained an increase in the number median diameter of water drop-
lets by about 3.7%, and a decrease in the number concentration of
submicron droplets by about 10.7%. It should be noted that all these
examples refer to the droplets or sticky particles.

POnly a couple of papers reported on the effect of the agglomera-
tion process on the mass and size distribution of the agglomerated
solid particles. For example, in a two-stage electrostatic precipitator
with a unipolar precharger/agglomerator energised by an AC voltage
of 100 Hz, the mass percentage of silicon powder decreased by 18%
for particles smaller than 0.2 mm, but increased in the size ranges of
2(cid:1)5 mm, 5(cid:1)10 mm and > 10 mm from 11% to 14%, 8% to 21%, and
10% to 12%, respectively [16]. In the same device, the mass percent-
age of talcum powder of size < 0.2 mm decreased from 22% to 11%,
and for particles in the range of 2(cid:1)5 mm, from 13% to 6%. However,
the mass percentage of 5(cid:1)10 mm particles increased from 56% to
65%. For the mixed silicon and talcum powders (mass ratio 1:1), the
mass collection efficiency increased from 34.3% to 59.5%. For lower
frequencies of the AC voltage, the collision probability of particles
was lower, but it increased for higher frequencies. The amplitude of
oscillations of the particles decreased for higher frequencies, which
resulted in a lower collision frequency. Although the authors
reported on a significant shift in the size distribution of these par-
ticles, the information on the construction of that agglomerator, and
on the procedure of particle mass concentration measurement, was
incomplete. The large increase in the mass of agglomerated particles
could be caused by the surface properties of these particles and/or
by the electrostatic effects (for example, tribocharging or Van der
Waals forces between the silicon and talcum particles). The physical
properties of the fly ash particles can be different from these
investigated by Bai et al. [16], which may explain the differences
in the agglomeration efficiency between the particles of different
kinds.

PFrom these examples it can be concluded that the processes of
coagulation and agglomeration of liquid droplets and solid particles
are different, which explains the discrepancies between the results
obtained by different authors, for the particles of different physical
properties. Significant changes in the size distribution were
observed mainly for liquid droplets or sticky particles (cigarette
smoke, DOP, oil mist, water), which can permanently coagulate after
their collision, independently of their sizes. In the case of solid par-
ticles, particularly fly ash,
the agglomerated particles can be
detached if the aerodynamic or electrostatic forces are larger than
the cohesive forces between them (van der Waals, electrostatic etc.).
In almost all papers on particle agglomerators, the authors empha-
sise that the smaller particles adhere to the larger ones during the
process of agglomeration, and that agglomerates of particles of a
similar size, particularly large particles, are rarely observed. For
example, Eliasson and Egli [79] and Eliasson et al. [80] showed SEM
micrographs of the particles after the bipolar agglomeration, and
Sobczyk et al. [260] after the unipolar agglomeration. In both cases,
about 10(cid:1)50 submicron and nanoparticles were deposited onto the
surface of a larger particle, of a size of about 10(cid:1)20 mm. Examples of
such a particle-collector agglomerate, and a single large particle of

Psimilar size, sampled when the agglomerator was switched-off, are
shown in Fig. 16. Such a small number of small particles cannot
change the size and mass of the larger particle significantly, to the
value detectable by a standard device. For example, a particle of
diameter of 10 mm covered with 50 particles of a mean size of
0.5 mm can change its mass by only about 0.6%. This process of parti-
cle-collector agglomeration needs, therefore, further experimental
studies and numerical modelling.

5. Electrostatic particle collectors

PIn a two-stage electrostatic precipitator, the particles leaving the
precharger or agglomerator are removed from the conveying gas in
the collection stage. Two types of collectors are used: (1) parallel-
plate collector, composed of a plurality of parallel plates, every sec-
ond of which is at a high potential, with the rest being grounded; or
(2) conventional electrostatic precipitator composed of spiked-rods
or wire discharge electrodes, and plate collection electrodes.

PAn electrostatic precipitator with a discharge electrode is used
when the particles entering the collection stage are not charged to a
sufficiently high level, to be precipitated in a parallel plate collector,
for example, because of the charge depletion effect when a bipolar
agglomerator is used. In a parallel-plate collector, the trajectories of
charged particles are deflected by the electric field produced
between these electrodes towards one of the electrodes.

PBecause there is the lack of electric discharge and ionic wind in a
parallel-plate electrode system, the equations of motion of a particle
can be simplified. A particle of the size dp entering the collector at
the plane of one electrode will be deposited onto the opposite elec-
trode when the length L of the collection electrodes and the distance
d between them are determined by the following inequality:

L
d

> wxðdpÞ
wyðdpÞ

ð24Þ

where wx and wy are the components of the particle's velocity vector
w parallel and perpendicular to the surface of the electrodes, respec-
tively, dp is the particle diameter, d is the distance between the elec-
trodes, and L is the length of the collection electrodes. This
inequality means that the time of particle motion towards the col-
lection electrode has to be shorter than the time period in which the
particle flows throughout the collection stage.

pE 1⁄4 3ph

PThe velocity wy of a particle moving towards the collection elec-
trode (in the y direction) can be determined from the equilibrium of
the electrostatic force (2) and the Stokes drag force (3):
pspd2
where E = U/d is the electric field between parallel-plate electrodes
of the collection stage, and U is the voltage applied to the electrodes.
PThe component of the particle velocity perpendicular to the elec-
trode surface is proportional to the diameter of the particle and its

gdpwy

ð25Þ

Psurface charge density:

wy 1⁄4

spdpE
3h

g

ð26Þ

PFrom Eqs. (24) and (26), the distance d between the electrodes in
the collection stage depends on the diameter dp of the smallest par-
ticles which have to be removed, charged to a surface charge density
sp, and cannot be larger than:

d <

spdpLE
3h
gu

ð27Þ

PIt is assumed in this equation that the particle velocity wx is equal
to the gas velocity between the electrodes wx = u, and that the electric
field E between the electrodes is the maximal prior to breakdown.
The length L of the collection electrodes is assumed to be dependent
on the space available for a specific installation (its "footprint").

PFor example, for a gas velocity of 1 m/s, an electric field between
the electrodes of E = 5 £ 105 V/m, and the collection electrode length
of 1 m, the distance between the electrodes should be no larger than
about 250 mm, when the particles of a size of 10 mm, charged to a
surface charge density sp = 2.6 £ 10¡6C/m2, are removed. However,
for 100 nm particles charged to 1e, the required distance is 5 mm.
Too-short interelectrode distances are, however, not practical in
industrial conditions. In industrial electrostatic precipitators, the
length and height of the collection electrodes are usually greater
than 10 m. These electrodes are welded or pleated from separate
sheets, and folded in order to keep their stiffness. Keeping such a
small (a couple of mm) interelectrode distance over the whole elec-
trode surface is practically impossible. Beside these constructional
problems, the whole system would be too heavy, and a strong sup-
porting structure should be used in order to hang these electrodes.

PHowever, when an agglomeration stage is used, the smallest par-
ticles are first deposited onto the larger ones (cf. Fig. 16), before their
precipitation, and the distance between the electrodes can be larger,
i.e., that determined for the larger particles (cf. (27)). This is the prin-
cipal reason behind the electrostatic agglomerators used for the
removal of submicron and nanoparticles.

PThe performance of an electrostatic precipitator, regardless of its
type, is characterised by the overall mass collection efficiency, which
is defined by the following formula:

h
m

1⁄4 1(cid:1)mout
min

ð28Þ

where mout and min are the mass concentrations of particles at the
outlet and the inlet of electrostatic precipitator, respectively.

PFor a more detailed characterisation of the precipitation process,
the fractional collection efficiency is used. This parameter shows the
collection efficiency of a precipitator in a given class of particle size.
The fractional collection efficiency can be determined as the mass
collection efficiency hm, or the number collection efficiency hn, from

PWhen the mass or number concentration of particles is measured
at the outlet of electrostatic precipitator only, the on/off collection
efficiency can be determined from the particle mass or number con-
centrations in each class of particle size, when the voltages applied
to the precipitator are switched on (nON) or off (nOFF):

PThe on/off collection efficiency better characterises the effect of a
specific stage of two-stage electrostatic precipitator on the overall
collection efficiency of the whole system, and is usually used in a
laboratory when novel devices are tested.

PThe properties of electrostatic precipitator are also characterised
by the filtration index m, which is a measure of the mass collection
efficiency in a logarithmic scale for a unit pressure drop:

m 1⁄4

(cid:9)
(cid:8)
ln 1=λ

where Dp is the pressure drop in the device.

PA disadvantage of the parallel-plate electrodes free of the corona
discharge is that the cohesion forces between the particles deposited
on the collection electrodes are lower than in the case when the ion
current is flowing through the dust cake. Low cohesive forces can
result in particle re-entrainment.

PRe-entrainment occurs when the collection electrodes are
cleaned by rapping, but it also occurs during the process of particle
collection. The re-entrainment of dust particles from the collection
electrode is a severe practical problem, not only in the case of elec-
trostatic precipitators with a discharge electrode, but also in the par-
allel-plate collectors. When particles of low resistivity ( < 104 Vm)
are collected, even in the case of a corona-free parallel-plate collec-
tion electrode system, the charge from the deposited particles leaks
to the collection electrode. In the presence of an electric field, the
particles are re-charged by the electrostatic induction in the electric
field between the electrodes, and finally, due to the electrostatic
forces, pulled out from the layer to the gas flow [20,47,117,216,232,
284]. These re-entrained particles can be expelled from the last field
of the electrostatic precipitator to the atmosphere. It was estimated
that up to 30% of particles are expelled to the atmosphere due to the
rapping and electrostatic detachment from the collection electrodes
in the last field of the electrostatic precipitator [244].

PAnother mechanism of the particles' re-entrainment is an "explo-
sive” breakdown of a fly ash cake during the onset of spark or back-
corona discharge. The back-corona discharge occurs when the dust
resistivity is too high ( > 1010 Vm) [110,151,152,164]. Masuda and
Hosokawa [188] also observed the turbulent gas motion, similar to
the ionic wind, which exists in the parallel-plate electrode system,
even in the absence of corona discharge, and causes turbulent parti-
cle re-entrainment. This phenomenon has been caused by the
motion of charged particles towards the collection electrode. The
micro-turbulence induced by charged particles approaching the col-
lection electrode is responsible for low collection efficiency in the
submicron range [15].

PThe turbulent mechanism of particle re-entrainment was
explained by Atten [15]. The number of micro-turbulent vortices

Pincreases with increasing particle concentration. Typically, the Rey-
nolds number in electrostatic precipitators is of the order of
104(cid:1)105, but this number can increase due to the secondary electro-
hydrodynamic flow caused by the ionic wind generated by corona
discharge. The vortices can drive the particles in the direction oppo-
site to the electric field force. The flow instability appears when the
electric force on the charge carriers, of the force density of rQE
(where rQ is the space charge density), is higher than the force
resulting from the gas viscosity. This phenomenon is characterised
by the EHD turbulence number [15]:

T 1⁄4

ɛ0ɛrUampl
bih

g

ð32Þ

where e0er is the gas permittivity, Uappl is the voltage applied to the
electrodes of ESP, bi is the mobility of the charge carriers (gaseous
ions or charged particles), and hg is the gas dynamic viscosity.

PThe amplitude of fluctuations of the gas velocity induced by the
motion of charge carriers is of the order of (e0er /rg)1/2E, where rg is
the gas density, and E the mean magnitude of the electric field. The
second parameter considered by Atten [15] is the mobility parame-
ter:

ð33Þ

When M < < 1, the amplitude of fluctuation of the gas velocity is
much smaller than the drift velocity of charge carriers towards the
collection electrode, and the trajectories of the charge carriers are
only slightly perturbed by the gas flow. For M > 3, the charge carriers
are entrained by the gas flow, and the mean current density
increases. In the case of an electrostatic precipitator, the condition of
M > 3 is met for submicron particles ( < 1 mm) charged to a few ele-
mentary charges in a typical electric field of E = 5 £ 105 V/m. In that
case, the particles can undergo the turbulent mixing.

PThese considerations indicate that the cohesion forces between
the particles deposited on the collection electrodes of a parallel-
plate collector, free of corona discharge, are lower than in the case
when ionic current is flowing through the dust cake. However, on
the other hand, the re-entrainment due to the EHD turbulent mixing
does not exist, because of the lack of corona discharge.

PIn order to increase the collection efficiency and decrease the
particle re-entrainment, an AC voltage of sine-wave, trapezoidal, or
rectangular waveforms was applied to the electrodes of the collec-
tion stage [188,310,327,328]. For the AC voltage, the amplitude of
oscillations of particles of 10 mm in diameter is of the order of 1 mm
for the typical operational conditions. When a particle approaches
the collection electrode, it is deposited due to its oscillatory motion
induced by the AC electric field. Using AC energisation, the collection
efficiency can be increased, compared to the DC energisation.

PThe effect of particle re-entrainment on the collection efficiency
of a two-stage electrostatic precipitator has been investigated by
Zukeran et al. [327,330]. The authors observed a negative collection
efficiency for particles < 0.1 mm, as the effect of particles' re-entrain-
ment from the collection electrode. Zukeran et al. [330] have also
considered the de-agglomeration of large charged particles, caused
by Coulomb repulsion. In two-stage electrostatic precipitators, this
phenomenon occurred only for high particle loadings ( > 5 £ 1010/
m3), but by using the pulsed energisation of the electrodes of the
electrostatic precipitator, the re-entrainment was largely reduced.
Using pulsed energisation, the collection efficiency was increased
above 90% for particles < 0.1 mm [330], but this mode of supply does
not allow an increase in the collection efficiency for larger particles
( > 0.1 mm).

PThe morphology of the dust cake built on the collection electro-
des of a two-stage electrostatic precipitator was studied by Zukeran
et al. [327], and Zukeran and Yasumoto [332] (cf. [208]), for various

Pmodes of energisation of the collection electrode. When the collec-
tion electrode was energised by a DC voltage, pearl-like chain struc-
tures were formed on it. These agglomerates were pulled into the
interelectrode space by the electrostatic force acting on the electric
charge induced on these agglomerates in the electric field. Because
of this re-entrainment, the fractional collection efficiency for larger
particles ( > 1 mm) was negative [327]. When the collection electro-
des were supplied from an AC source, the electric field periodically
changed its direction, and the charge induced on these chain
agglomerates was also periodically changed, which prevented the
induction of a sufficiently high net electric charge on the deposited
particles to be re-entrained.

PZukeran et al. [328] have also shown that the re-entrainment of
particles from the collection electrode in a parallel-plate collector
can be reduced by the energisation of the electrodes by a rectangular
high voltage of low frequency (1(cid:1)4.5 Hz). For a given direction of the
electric field, an electric charge is induced on the chain particles built
on the electrode. The electric force on this chain becomes repulsive
when the electric field changes its direction, but the charge induced
on the particle does not immediately reverse. This repulsion force
causes the chain-like agglomerates to contract to spherules. The
adhesion force for spherical agglomerates is larger and the aerody-
namic force on them is weaker than for the chain or dendrite struc-
tures.

PVarious constructions of the collection electrode have also been
developed with the goal of the abatement of particle re-entrainment.
Yasumoto et al. [310] have developed a modified collection electrode
made from a perforated (hole-punched) metal sheet with holes of
2.5 mm in diameter, of a total aperture of 17.2%. The electrode was
energised by a trapezoidal AC high voltage. The precipitated par-
ticles were agglomerated in the form of chains when the pulse volt-
age was on, similarly to a DC energisation, but they stuck to the
electrode when the voltage was off, because of the lack of electric
forces on them. This effect prevented the particles' re-entrainment.
A similar collection electrode was used by Wen et al. [295]. The col-
lection electrode was equipped with an additional perforated guid-
ance-plate. The particles were driven towards the collection
electrode by the electric field, flowed through the holes in the guid-
ance plate, and were deposited on the collection electrode behind
the plate. In this way, the deposited particles were not exposed to
the gas flow and the electric field, and their re-entrainment from the
collection electrode was reduced.

PThese examples show that the problem of particles' re-entrain-
ment has not been solved properly and still needs further studies
and novel constructions of the collection electrode.

6. Discussion

PTwo-stage electrostatic precipitators are applied for
the
removal of fine fly ash or diesel particles because they are able
to precipitate the PM2.5 particles with higher collection effi-
ciency than conventional electrostatic precipitators. Particles
conveyed by a flue or exhaust gas are first charged in a pre-
charger stage, optimised with respect to the maximisation of the
electric charge of the particles, and are then removed from the
gas in the collection stage. The collection stage comprises a set
of parallel plates, without any sharp points which could generate
a spark discharge. The electric field between the collection elec-
trodes can be increased to 106 V/m (higher than in ESPs), which
the electric force on the charged particles, and
increases
improves the collection efficiency. In order to further increase
the collection efficiency, the precharger stage has been combined
with an electrostatic agglomerator, in which the submicron and
nanoparticles can be agglomerated to larger particles, or can be
deposited onto the larger particles ( > 5 mm), for which the col-
lection efficiency is higher.

PThe construction of the precharger should maximise the particle
penetration (minimise the precipitation of the particles) through the
precharger stage. The electrodes of a precharger can be supplied
from a DC, AC, or pulsed high-voltage source. By the DC energisation,
the trajectories of particles are deflected towards the corona-counter
electrode by the electric field between these electrodes. In order to
prevent that deflection and minimise the particle precipitation, the
particles must flow with high velocity, usually a few metres per sec-
ond, through the precharger. However, the residence time of the
particles within the precharger becomes too short with high gas
velocities, and the electric charge imparted to the particles is lower
than that predicted by the Pauthenier limit. The AC energisation,
proposed and tested by several authors, produces an alternating
electric field in the charging zone and causes oscillatory motion of
the particles within the precharger, which prevents the deposition
of these particles onto the electrodes. Using AC voltage, the charge
imparted to the particles > 1 mm can be close to the Pauthenier
limit. Although the penetration of particles through a precharger
energised by an AC voltage is higher than through a DC precharger,
it has been noticed by many authors that even then the penetration
of particles larger than 200 nm decreases with increasing particle
size. This effect can be caused by a higher electric charge on the
larger particles, and larger amplitude of their oscillation in the AC
electric field. Pulsed energisation can be an alternative to the AC
electric field applied to a precharger. A pulsed voltage applied to the
discharge electrodes in a precharger allows the generation of ions at
a density higher than by the DC energisation, and the particles can
be charged to a higher level, but the time-averaged force driving the
particles towards the precharger electrodes is lower.

PTwo types of agglomerators were used in order to increase the
mean size of particles: bipolar and unipolar. Both of these types can
be energised by a DC or AC voltage. In a bipolar agglomerator, the
oppositely charged particles are forced to collide, but such a two-
particle agglomerate composed of particles of similar size has a
reduced electric charge due to charge neutralisation, and requires
further charging in order to agglomerate with other particles before
its precipitation. This is the main disadvantage of bipolar agglomera-
tors. Multistage precharging-agglomeration devices, which were
proposed for fine particle removal, seem to be impractical in indus-
trial conditions. AC agglomerators combined with a precharger or
precipitator, in which ions of opposite signs were generated in every
half cycle of the AC voltage, had also failed, because they provided
only a negligible increase in the collection efficiency. The charge
depletion effect and the short periods of particle charging, limited
only to the time intervals, in which the instant magnitude of voltage
is higher than the corona onset voltage, were mainly responsible for
the low collection efficiency of these devices.

PUnipolar agglomerators can operate effectively, but only when
the charged particles are subjected to oscillatory motion. In this
case, the process of agglomeration employs the differences in the
mobility of small and large particles. Larger particles (5(cid:1)20 mm),
which are charged to a higher level, oscillate with a larger amplitude
than the small (submicron) particles, which are only weakly charged
or are uncharged. During this oscillatory motion, the large particles
can collide with the small particles, which are deposited onto them.
This type of agglomeration process is called 'kinematic agglomera-
tion' and the resulting agglomerate the 'collector-particle agglomer-
ate'. Chain-like or globular agglomerates composed only of
submicron particles were scarcely observed at the outlet of unipolar
agglomerators. In the unipolar agglomerators, the frequency of the
AC voltage should be sufficiently low because the amplitude of oscil-
lations of a particle is inversely proportional to the frequency of the
AC voltage (cf. Eq. (22)). However, this frequency cannot be too low
because the number of collected particles depends on the number of
oscillations of the collector flowing throughout the agglomerator.
Usually, a frequency of AC voltage in the range of 50(cid:1)100 Hz was

Passumed to be the optimal one with respect to the collection effi-
ciency, but this frequency interval was determined experimentally.
The problem of optimisation of the kinematic agglomeration process
with respect to the AC frequency needs further comprehensive theo-
retical studies.

PIt has been shown in this review that the agglomeration of fly ash
particles does not change the particle size distribution significantly,
regardless of the type of agglomerator used. However, significant
changes in the size distribution were observed in the case of diesel
particles, liquid droplets and semi-dry particles. These differences
can be explained by high cohesive forces between diesel particles or
any sticky particles, which prevent their de-agglomeration. The pro-
cess of agglomeration of fly ash particles needs, therefore, further
fundamental studies in order to explain the gas flow effect and elec-
trostatic conditions under which the small fly ash particles can
detach from a larger collector.

PAlthough most of the reviewed papers have presented only the
laboratory-scale experiments with two-stage electrostatic precipita-
tors, and the practical applications of this type of device and the
experiments in semi-industrial-scale installations were few, in the
following, the problems encountered in the two-stage electrostatic
precipitators will be briefly discussed with reference to some practi-
cal examples. Three classes of applications of two-stage electrostatic
precipitators will be discussed: (1) the precipitation of fly ash par-
ticles from coal-fired power boilers, (2) the removal of nanoparticles
from diesel engine exhausts, and (3) the cleaning of air in road tun-

P(1) Precipitation of submicron fly ash particles from flue gases.
Large-scale installations comprising a two-stage electrostatic precip-
itator, used for the removal of fly ash particles from flue gases gener-
ated by coal-fired boilers were tested by Masuda and Hosokawa
[188], Watanabe et al. [294], Jayaram et al. [122], Truce et al. [277],
Truce and Wilkins [279], Wilkins et al. [298], Xu F. et al. [301], and
Sobczyk et al. [260]. In the following, it is assumed that 'large-scale'
refers to an installation in which the flow rate of the gas which con-
veys the particles is higher than 103 Nm3/h, or where the cross sec-
tion of the channel is larger than at least 0.5 £ 0.5 m.
PIn the two-stage electrostatic precipitator

investigated by
Masuda and Hosokawa [188], for the control of high-resistivity fly
ash particles, the Masuda boxer charger, free of back-corona dis-
charge, was used as the particle precharger. Two types of collection
stages were tested: a spiked-plate electrostatic precipitator ener-
gised by a pulse voltage of 50(cid:1)1000 Hz pulse repetition rate, and a
parallel-plate collector with DC voltage applied to the electrodes.
The collection efficiency of the electrostatic precipitator energised
by the pulse voltage was higher, however, the two-stage electro-
static precipitator using the parallel-plate collection electrodes col-
lected the
energy
consumption.

charged particles with only negligible

PWatanabe et al. [294] used a quadrupole agglomerator, which
consisted of two grounded parallel plates and two cylindrical elec-
trodes between them. The electrodes were energised by an AC volt-
age superimposed on a DC voltage. Using this energisation, the
efficiency of this agglomerator was higher because the number of
collisions between the particles in a unit time was larger due to the
oscillatory motion of these particles. For particles smaller than
100 nm, the amplitude of oscillations of the particles was indepen-
dent of the particle size, but for larger particles it increased almost
linearly with the particle diameter, and was a couple of orders of
magnitude larger than the equivalent Brownian displacement in a
unit time. The collection efficiency of that system was about 98%.

PA bipolar turbulent-mixing agglomerator called 'INDIGO' has
been installed at a Chinese power station after a 300 MW boiler. The
opacity of flue gases was reduced by 50(cid:1)80%, and the mass emission
of PM10 particles by 50% [298]. The collection efficiency of the

Pelectrostatic precipitator with that agglomerator was about 50% for
PM2.5 particles, and increased to 90 wt.% for particles < 0.1 mm
[279]. The agglomerator was placed in front of the first stage of the
electrostatic precipitator. The turbulent deposition of the submicron
particles onto the larger ones was the advantage of such construc-
tion, however, the charging of all fly ash particles, among them the
largest ones, which are precipitated due to the gravity, is the disad-
vantage of that system, because it increases the total energy con-
sumption. About 75% of gaseous mercury had been removed from
the flue gases, with the addition of activated carbon [277,279]. Six
similar installations had also been built in the US and Australia by
2008 [271].

PSobczyk et al. [260] have investigated a two-stage electrostatic
precipitator, in which an electrostatic precharger was combined
with an agglomerator in a single device. The agglomerated fly ash
particles were collected by a spiked wire-plate electrostatic precipi-
tator. Because the precharger was energised by an AC voltage, the
motion of the particles was oscillatory and perpendicular to the
direction of their flow, and the deposition of particles on the electro-
des was reduced. The total number collection efficiency for PM2.5
fly ash particles from a coal-fired power plant was higher than 95%,
and the mass collection efficiency was > 99%.

P(2) Removal of nanoparticles from diesel engine exhausts. Diesel
engines supplied with heavy fuel oil with a high sulphur content,
like those used for vessel propulsion, emit sulphur dioxide, nitrogen
oxides, unburned hydrocarbons, black carbon and other nanopar-
ticles [68]. Diesel engine exhausts are extremely difficult to clean
using an electrostatic precipitator because of the high content of
nanoparticles, which electrical charging is difficult. Black carbon
present in the exhausts contaminates the electrodes and insulators
of electrostatic precipitators. Two-stage electrostatic precipitators
used for the cleaning of diesel exhausts were investigated by Masuda
and Moon [192], Kawada et al. [138], Zukeran et al. [325,331], Kawa-
kami et al. [139], and Katatani et al. [135,136].

PMasuda and Moon [192] have developed and investigated a sys-
tem comprising an electrostatic precharger, agglomerator and mov-
ing-belt electrostatic precipitator, which collected soot particles
from a diesel engine. The moving belt transported the dust cake to a
separate chamber in which the deposit was brushed. Such a solution
facilitated the removal of sticky particles and eliminated problems
with the particles' re-entrainment. The electric heating of the dis-
charge electrodes prevented soot deposition onto it because of the
enhanced thermal oxidation of black carbon and the sputtering of
deposit by the positive ion bombardment. The overall collection effi-
ciency of that system was higher than 95% for PM1 particles, and for
a gas velocity lower than 1 m/s and a dust loading of 120 mg/m3.

PA two-stage electrostatic precipitator developed by Zukeran et al.
[331] was used to simultaneously remove SO2 and PM from the
exhaust produced by a marine diesel engine. The SO2 was removed
by the condensation of water vapours after decreasing the gas tem-
perature below the dew point (to 20 °C). The PM and mist droplets
were removed in the parallel-plate collection stage. The collection
efficiency for PM was between 90% and 95% for a gas tempera-
ture > 40 °C, but it decreased to about 71(cid:1)87% for a temperature of
30 °C.

P(3) Air cleaning in road tunnels. Besides noxious gases, such as car-
bon dioxide, unburned hydrocarbons, nitride oxides, and sulphur
dioxide present in the air in road tunnels, there is also a high concen-
tration of submicron particles emitted by car engines and originating
from tires and the road surface. For long tunnels, there is the need
for a fast exchange of air, but in order to suppress the environmental
impact of these exhausts, the air has to be cleaned before its dis-
charge to the atmosphere. Two-stage electrostatic precipitators with
the corona discharge electrodes in the collection stage, energised by
a DC or AC voltage were tested as gas cleaning devices in road tun-
nels by Kubo et al. [154], Zukeran et al. [326(cid:1)328], Miyake et al.

PZukeran et al. [326,327] have used a two-stage electrostatic pre-
cipitator with a suppressed effect of particles' re-entrainment for
the cleaning of air in a road tunnel. The collection efficiency for par-
ticles larger than 1 mm was initially high, but it decreased during the
system operation, and after a certain time, stabilised at a level below
50%. This time of stabilisation was dependent on the size of particles
and was longer for larger particles. For example, the time of stabili-
sation was 3 min for particles of 1(cid:1)2 mm., 7 min for 2(cid:1)5 mm, and
15 min for particles larger than 5 mm. Due to the re-entrainment of
particles from the collection electrode, the fractional collection effi-
ciency for particles larger than 2 mm was negative. In another ver-
sion, the collection efficiency was higher than 80% for the particles
of 300(cid:1)1000 nm, during a time of 40 min [328]. In order to suppress

Pthe particles' re-entrainment, the parallel-plate collection electrodes
were energised by a rectangular voltage of
low frequency
(1(cid:1)4.5 Hz).

PA two-stage electrostatic precipitator designed by Kubo et al.
[154] comprised a dielectric-barrier-discharge (DBD) particle pre-
charger and a parallel-plate collector. The system used for the clean-
ing of air in a highway tunnel allowed simultaneous removal of fine
dust particles (0.03(cid:1)3 mm) and decomposition of NOx. The collec-
tion efficiency for dust particles was higher than 90%, and the
removal efficiency of NOx was about 95%. Another construction of a
two-stage electrostatic precipitator designed for the cleaning of air
in an automobile tunnel, with minimised ozone generation was
designed by Yasumoto et al. [309]. The collection efficiency was 80%
for PM10 particles, with negative polarity of the discharge electrode.

Pprecipitator for the cleaning of air in road tunnels, with a saw-tooth
like discharge electrode in the corona precharger stage. The inter-
mittent voltages were applied to the discharge electrodes and the
collection plates to reduce the particles' re-entrainment. In order to
keep a high collection efficiency for this system, the collection elec-
trodes were washed periodically with water. Katatani et al.
[135,136] have developed a two-stage electrostatic precipitator uti-
lising dielectrophoretic forces for the deposition of particles onto
the sharp edges at the collection electrode, without the need to use
the corona discharge for charging the particles. The authors noticed
that the re-entrained particles were mainly in the form of agglomer-
ates. The method of particle charging by induction, used in that sys-
tem, was of low efficiency, and the number collection efficiency was
only about 5%, and mass collection efficiency was about 10%.

7. Conclusions

PThe increasing awareness of the environmental and health
threats caused by the gaseous compounds and particulate matter
(PM) emitted during the combustion of fossil fuels has spurred an
intense interest in the prevention of these effects. One of the ways to
abate the detrimental effects of the emission of PM contaminants is
the improvement of the precipitation technology. Conventional gas-
cleaning devices used in industry and power plants, such as cyclo-
nes, bag filters, granular-bed filters, scrubbers, and electrostatic pre-
cipitators, can remove particles larger than 2.5 mm with high mass
collection efficiency ( > 99%), but are inefficient in the removal of
smaller particles ( < 2.5 mm). In order to overcome these limitations,
and for better protection of the environment and humans, various
modifications to the construction of conventional gas cleaning
devices have been proposed in the literature. In order to increase
the collection efficiency of electrostatic precipitators, which are
the most frequently used devices in the energy sector, the pro-
cesses of electrostatic charging of the particles and their precipi-
tation have been separated. Another proposed solution is the
agglomeration of the particles in order to increase the mass col-
lection efficiency of electrostatic precipitators, particularly for
PM2.5 particles.

have been systematically reviewed and discussed in this paper. A
two-stage electrostatic precipitator comprises a precharger and/or
agglomerator stage, and a collection stage. The precharger is used in
order to impart an electric charge to the particles, before the precipi-
tation of these particles in the collection stage. An agglomerator,
which can be installed between the precharger and collector, com-
bined with a precharger, or used instead of a precharger, is applied
in order to increase the mean size of particles or for the deposition
of small PM2.5 particles onto the larger ones. The process of agglom-
eration allows an increase in the collection efficiency of that system
for PM2.5 particles.

PThe agglomerators can be constructed as bipolar or unipolar
devices. In the unipolar agglomerators, the ions and particles of only
one sign of the electric charge participate in the process of particle
charging and/or agglomeration, while in the bipolar agglomerators,
the charges of both polarities are employed for the process of
agglomeration.

PThe collection stage in a two-stage electrostatic precipitator is
usually constructed as a set of parallel-plate electrodes energised by
a DC or AC voltage, and it is free of corona discharge. Because of the
lack of discharge electrodes in a parallel-plate collector, the electric
field between the electrodes can be higher than in an electrostatic
precipitator, and the particles charged in the previous stage can be
precipitated with higher collection efficiency. The lack of a discharge
current between the electrodes reduces the total power consump-
tion of the system. Cooling the electrodes with water, as proposed
by several authors, provided higher collection efficiency and abated

re-entrainment. However,

PThe reason behind using an electrostatic agglomerator as a device
for improving the removal of submicron and nanoparticles, is that
the smallest particles are first deposited on the larger ones in the
agglomeration stage, and these agglomerates can be more easily
removed in the collection stage or by any other gas cleaning device.
Without the agglomeration, the submicron and nanoparticles could
leave the collection stage of a two-stage electrostatic precipitator
without precipitation, because of a too-low charge on them. Other-
wise, an unacceptably short interelectrode space or very long elec-
trodes would be required to allow these particles to be collected.

PRegarding the optimal construction of a two-stage electrostatic
precipitator it can be concluded from this review that a unipolar pre-
charger with an alternating electric field in the charging zone can be
recommended for the charging of submicron particles. The particles
leaving such a precharger are charged to a relatively high level that
facilitates their efficient precipitation by a parallel plate collector,
without the need for additional charging in a corona discharge. Such
a solution reduces the total power consumption of the precipitation
system. The alternating electric field also prevents the precipitation
of particles in the agglomerator stage, which reduces the contamina-
tion of the electrodes and insulators.

PA unipolar agglomerator employing the kinematic agglomeration
process provides better results regarding the removal of submicron
particles by a two-stage electrostatic precipitator, than by other
types of devices. A unipolar agglomerator can effectively be used for
the removal of submicron particles ( < 1 mm) when the concentra-
tion of larger particles (5(cid:1)20 mm) in the flue gas is sufficiently high,
because the main mechanism of the agglomeration in such a device
is kinematic agglomeration. In kinematic agglomeration, the small
particles are deposited onto a large particle during its oscillatory
motion. Usually, a frequency of supply voltage between 50 and
100 Hz is assumed to be the optimal for kinematic agglomeration
and for the maximisation of the collection efficiency. However, the
problem of the optimal frequency of voltage applied to the electro-
des requires further comprehensive theoretical studies. It has been
shown in many papers that the agglomerates produced by kinematic
agglomeration are sufficiently stable to allow their precipitation by a
parallel-plate collector or conventional electrostatic precipitator.

PThe parallel-plate collector is the optimal device used for the
removal of particles from flue gases in a two-stage electrostatic pre-
cipitator, in which the particles entering the collector are highly
charged. The advantage of the parallel-plate electrode systems is
that the back-corona discharge, which distorts the precipitation pro-
cess and decreases the over-all collection efficiency in a standard
electrostatic precipitator, cannot be initiated. When, additionally,
the collector electrodes are energised by a rectangular voltage,
changing its polarity with low frequency (about 1 Hz), the particle
re-entrainment is significantly reduced, and the apparent collection
surface is doubled because the particles are alternately precipitated
on both electrodes.

PIn some constructions reviewed in this paper, the particle
agglomerator was combined with the precharger or collector. These
combinations allow the reduction of the total length of a two-stage
electrostatic precipitator (its footprint), and the investment costs
can be decreased. The advantage of the one-step precharger/agglom-
erator over the two-step agglomerators is that the charge depletion
effect does not occur. In a one-step unipolar precharger/agglomera-
tor, the particles are continuously charged and remain charged after
leaving the device. These particles can be removed by a parallel plate
collector.

PRegarding future fundamental studies in the field of two-stage
precipitation technology, two problems regarding the agglomeration
of particles have to be solved: (1) theoretical description of the

Pparticle-collector and particle-particle agglomeration for the case
where particles of both sizes are electrically charged, and the process
takes place in the electric field. (2) The problem of stability of the
electrically charged agglomerate conveyed by the gas in an electric
field, and explanation of the preferential particle-collector agglom-
eration in the case of fly ash particles subjected to kinematic
agglomeration. Both issues also require comprehensive experimen-
tal research.

PThe two-stage electrostatic precipitators allow a higher fractional
collection efficiency to be obtained for PM2.5 particles than other
conventional systems, and are recommended as highly-effective
devices for gas cleaning in power plants, cement or chemical indus-
tries. The collection efficiency of two-stage electrostatic precipita-
tors with a particle agglomerator can be higher than 95% for PM2.5
particles. The presented data indicate that the two-stage electro-
static precipitation technology has matured for industrial applica-
tion.
