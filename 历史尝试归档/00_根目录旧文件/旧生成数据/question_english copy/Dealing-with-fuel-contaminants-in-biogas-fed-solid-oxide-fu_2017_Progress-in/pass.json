    "question_text": "How does H2S poisoning affect the electrochemical performance of Ni-based SOFC anodes through competitive adsorption mechanisms at the triple-phase boundary?",
    "standard_answer": "H2S poisoning severely degrades Ni-based SOFC anode performance through competitive adsorption mechanisms. H2S molecules adsorb strongly on Ni active sites, displacing hydrogen adsorption and reducing the triple-phase boundary area where electrochemical reactions occur. This competitive adsorption follows Langmuir-type behavior where H2S coverage increases with concentration, effectively blocking sites for hydrogen oxidation. The displacement of hydrogen from active sites directly impacts the electrochemical performance by reducing the available surface area for the hydrogen oxidation reaction. This adsorption-driven degradation mechanism occurs even at trace contaminant levels and is particularly detrimental because it affects the critical triple-phase boundary regions where ionic conduction, electronic conduction, and gas transport converge for efficient electrochemical conversion.",

    "question_text": "How do multicomponent competitive adsorption phenomena in biogas purification systems affect the design and performance of fuel cell energy systems, particularly regarding the removal of contaminants like H2S and siloxanes?",
    "standard_answer": "Multicomponent competitive adsorption in biogas purification follows complex mass transfer and equilibrium principles that significantly impact removal efficiency and consequently affect fuel cell system design. The competition follows extended Langmuir or IAS (Ideal Adsorbed Solution) theory, where the presence of one contaminant reduces the adsorption capacity for others. This competitive behavior necessitates careful design of purification stages to achieve the required ppb-level purity for fuel cell applications. For SOFC and MCFC systems, which have stringent fuel purity requirements, the presence of contaminants even at trace levels can reduce the lifetime of key components like the fuel cell stack and reformer. The competitive adsorption dynamics between different contaminants must be considered when designing multi-stage purification systems using solid sorbents like activated carbons, which can provide deep clean-up of incoming fuel to comply with SOFC fuel quality requirements. Understanding these multicomponent interactions is crucial for developing efficient biogas purification units that can protect high-temperature fuel cells from degradation caused by contaminants.",

    "question_text": "How do mass transfer limitations affect the regeneration of spent adsorbents in biogas purification systems for fuel cell applications, and what implications does this have for system design and operation?",
    "standard_answer": "Mass transfer limitations significantly impact adsorbent regeneration in biogas purification systems, particularly for larger molecules like siloxanes. During regeneration, contaminants must diffuse from adsorption sites to the bulk gas phase, with larger molecules exhibiting slower diffusion rates that control the overall regeneration kinetics. This requires longer regeneration times and affects system design considerations. The paper specifically notes that 'mass transfer limitations often control the regeneration rate, with larger molecules like siloxanes exhibiting slower diffusion and requiring longer regeneration times.' This has direct implications for system operation, as 'the regeneration of spent adsorbents in biogas purification involves complex coupled heat and mass transfer mechanisms that critically impact system design.' These limitations necessitate careful consideration of regeneration cycle duration, energy requirements, and the selection of appropriate adsorbent materials to ensure complete contaminant removal while maintaining system efficiency and reliability for fuel cell applications.",
