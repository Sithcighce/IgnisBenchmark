    "question_text": "Using principles of fluid mechanics, heat transfer, and thermodynamics, explain how the addition of propane as a co-solvent enables significant temperature reduction (from 350°C to 280°C) in supercritical methanol transesterification of triglycerides while maintaining complete biodiesel conversion. Analyze the phase behavior modifications and mass transfer enhancements that facilitate this process improvement.",
    "standard_answer": "The addition of propane as a co-solvent fundamentally alters the phase behavior and mass transfer characteristics in supercritical methanol transesterification systems. From a fluid mechanics perspective, propane reduces the mixture viscosity and interfacial tension between non-polar triglycerides and polar methanol, creating a homogeneous reaction medium that eliminates mass transfer limitations. Thermodynamically, this enhanced miscibility allows for more efficient molecular collisions and reaction kinetics. The heat transfer implications are significant - by achieving complete conversion at 280°C instead of 350°C, the energy input requirement decreases substantially, improving the overall energy efficiency of the biodiesel production process. The phase behavior modification through co-solvent addition creates a single-phase system where triglycerides and methanol become completely miscible, enabling direct molecular interactions without the diffusion barriers present in multiphase systems. This homogeneous environment allows the reaction to proceed efficiently at lower temperatures while maintaining the high conversion rates typically requiring more severe thermal conditions. The reduction from 350°C to 280°C represents approximately 20% decrease in operating temperature, which translates to substantial energy savings in industrial-scale biodiesel production while maintaining the reaction completion.",

      "1": "Addition of a co-solvent can increase the mutual solubility between triglycerides and methanol. Consequently, biodiesel can be produced under milder conditions.",
      "2": "with a propane-to-methanol molar ratio of 0.1, the reaction temperature could be significantly reduced to 280 °C from 350 °C to obtain complete conversion of biodiesel"
