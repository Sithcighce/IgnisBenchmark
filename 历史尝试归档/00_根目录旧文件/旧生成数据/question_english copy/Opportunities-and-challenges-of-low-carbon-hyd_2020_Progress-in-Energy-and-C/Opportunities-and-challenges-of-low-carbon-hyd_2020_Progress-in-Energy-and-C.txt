Today, electricity & heat generation, transportation, and industrial sectors together produce more than 
80% of energy-related CO 2 emissions. Hydrogen may be used as an energy carrier and an alternative fuel 
in the industrial, residential, and transportation sectors for either heating, energy production from fuel 
cells, or direct fueling of vehicles. In particular, the use of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (HFCVs) has the po- 
tential to virtually eliminate CO 2 emissions from tailpipes and considerably reduce overall emissions from 
the transportation sector. Although steam methane reforming (SMR) is the dominant industrial process 
for hydrogen production, environmental concerns associated with CO 2 emissions along with the process 
intensiﬁcation and energy optimization are areas that still require improvement. Metallic membrane reac- 
tors (MRs) have the potential to address both challenges. MRs operate at signiﬁcantly lower pressures and 
temperatures compared with the conventional reactors. Hence, the capital and operating expenses could 
be considerably lower compared with the conventional reactors. Moreover, metallic membranes, specif- 
ically Pd and its alloys, inherently allow for only hydrogen permeation, making it possible to produce a 
stream of up to 99.999 + % purity. 

For smaller and emerging hydrogen markets such as the semiconductor and fuel cell industries, Pd-based 
membranes may be an appropriate technology based on the scales and purity requirements. In particular, 
at lower hydrogen production rates in small-scale plants, MRs with CCUS could be competitive compared 
to centralized H 2 production. On-site hydrogen production would also provide a self-suﬃcient supply and 
further circumvent delivery delays as well as issues with storage safety. In addition, hydrogen-producing 
MRs are a potential avenue to alleviate carbon emissions. However, material availability, Pd cost, and 
scale-up potential on the order of 1.5 million m 3 
/day may be limiting factors preventing wider application 
of Pd-based membranes. 

Regarding the economic production of hydrogen, the benchmark by the year 2020 has been determined 
and set in place by the U.S. DOE at less than $2.00 per kg of produced hydrogen. While the established 
SMR process can easily meet the set limit by DOE, other carbon-free processes such as water electrol- 
ysis, electron beam radiolysis, and gliding arc technologies do not presently meet this requirement. In 
particular, it is expected that the cost of hydrogen produced from natural gas without CCUS will re- 
main the lowest among all of the technologies, while the hydrogen cost produced from an SMR plant

with solvent-based carbon capture could be twice as expensive as the conventional SMR without carbon 
capture. Pd-based MRs have the potential to produce hydrogen at competitive prices with SMR plants 
equipped with carbon capture. 

Despite the signiﬁcant improvements in the electrolysis technologies, the cost of hydrogen produced by 
electrolysis may remain signiﬁcantly higher in most geographical locations compared with the hydrogen 
produced from fossil fuels. The cost of hydrogen via electrolysis may vary up to a factor of ten,d epending 
on the location and the electricity source. Nevertheless, due to its modular nature, the electrolysis process 
will likely play a signiﬁcant role in the hydrogen economy when implemented in suitable geographical 
locations and powered by renewable electricity. 

This review provides a critical overview of the opportunities and challenges associated with the use of the 
MRs to produce high-purity hydrogen with low carbon emissions. Moreover, a technoeconomic review of 
the potential methods for hydrogen production is provided and the drawbacks and advantages of each 
method are presented and discussed.

1. Introduction 

The generation of carbon-free electricity and the production of 
low-carbon fuels are urgent needs that must be addressed as the 
global concentration of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO 
2 ) emis- 
sions  is  rapidly  increasing.  According  to  the  most  recent  report 
published by  the  International Energy  Agency  (EIA)  in  2018,  the 
2  emissions increased by 1.7% compared 
global energy-related CO 
to 2017 and rose to the historic high value of 33.1 Gt CO 

2 [1] . 

Although CO 

2 emissions from all sectors increased consistently, 
the  power  sector  alone  accounted  for  two-thirds  of  emission 
growth. The amount of CO 
2 emissions by burning coal for power 
generation exceeded 10 Gt. Notably, only three countries, China, In- 
dia, and the U.S.,were responsible for more than 85% of the net 
emission  increases  in  2018.  For  China  and  India  this  can  be  at- 
tributed to their constant economic development. For the U.S. how- 
ever, other than a steady increase in oil consumption and higher 
economic growth in 2018, other factors such as changes in energy 
policy and withdrawal from the Paris Agreement may play a role 
in the increase of emissions [2] . Nevertheless, longer term emission 
studies could reveal the magnitude and importance of the impact 
that such a change in U.S. policy will have in terms of the nation’s 
CO 

2 emissions. 
One method of forecasting the CO 

2 emissions of various coun- 
tries is by examining their Human Development Index (HDI) and 
per  capita  electricity  consumption.  The  HDI  analysis  of  various 
countries shows that there is a direct relationship between the en- 
ergy consumption of a nation and its HDI. As shown in Figure 1 , 
the countries that have an HDI value of more than 0.9 consume the 
greatest energy per capita. For example, China and India consume 
4,292 and 818 kWh/year-person, respectively, while this number is 
close to 12,0 0 0 kWh/year-person for the U.S. The minimum energy 
requirement  for  a  country  to  have  an  HDI  of  at  least  0.9  is  ap- 
proximately 5,0 0 0 kWh/year-person, which is associated with the 
U.K.; therefore, if all the developed countries in the world with an 
HDI of 0.9 and above reduce their electricity consumption to 5,0 0 0 
kWh/year-person and only India and China increase theirs to the 
same amount, this results in a net annual increase of 2.4 Gt in CO 
2 
emissions. Hence, as long as countries rely on fossil fuels for gen- 
erating their electricity without implementing carbon capture and 
2 emissions are only going to rise 
sequestration units, the global CO 
in the coming decades. 

Despite constant improvements in fuel eﬃciency, development 
of less carbon intensive biofuels, developments in hybrid and elec- 
tric vehicles, and more stringent environmental policies, global CO 
2 
emissions from transport sector increased by 2% in 2016 compared 
to the previous year. Figure 2 -a shows the CO 
2 e) 
emissions by each sector worldwide and Figure 2 -b further breaks 
down the emissions associated with each mode of the transporta- 
tion sector for U.S. emissions only due to lack of information on 
other nations. Although the U.S. had the greatest transport emis- 
sions in 2016, the rate of increase of the emissions from this sector 
are signiﬁcantly higher in Asia with an alarming rate of 4.5%.

Electricity & heat generation, transportation, and industrial sec- 
tors  together  produce  more  than  80%  of  the  energy-related  CO

2  emissions  in- 
emissions.  In  the  transportation  sector  alone,  CO 
creased by an annual global average rate of 2.5% between 2010 and 
2015 [5] . In 2016, the transportation sector emitted approximately 
8 GtCO 
2 which accounted for roughly 25% of total global emissions 
(up from 23% in 2012). This number is 71% larger than the sector’s 
2 ) and 19% larger than the sector’s 
emissions in 1990 (2.8 Gt CO 
emissions in 2010 (6.7 Gt CO 
2 ). Nearly 74% of the transportation- 
related emissions are sourced exclusively from road vehicles [3] . 
As shown in Figure 2 , this number is even larger for the U.S. In 
2  emissions associated with passenger vehi- 
the U.S. the total CO 
cles and heavy trucks is approximately 83% [4] . Without the im-

the transportation sector are projected to reach 9.3-12 GtCO 
2 /yr by 
2050 which will be an increase between 16-50% compared to 2016 
[6] . 

The solutions proposed for mitigating climate change effects are 
deployment  of  low-carbon  fuels  and  improving  the  eﬃciency  of 
current  technologies  for  energy  conversion.  Hydrogen  fuels  from 
low-carbon energy resources are viewed as a promising long-term 
option for tackling CO 
2 emissions from distributed sources. The use 
of hydrogen as an alternative fuel in the industrial, residential, and 
transportation sectors can help to achieve these goals. In particu- 
lar, the use of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (HFCVs) has the potential 
2 emissions from tailpipes. If only 25% of 
to virtually eliminate CO 
vehicles were replaced by HFCVs, overall emissions from the trans- 
portation sector could be reduced by 10% [7] and curtail the emis- 
sions of NO x and SO x and particulate matter by 70-80% [8] . More- 
over, hydrogen can be used to supply a proton exchange membrane 
fuel cell (PEMFC) to generate electricity, which only produces wa- 
ter as a byproduct [9] . 

Until the 1960s hydrogen was used in the form of town gas for 
street lighting and also as a source of energy for heating, cooking, 
and lighting homes [8] . Today, the same concept can be extended 

to use on demand renewably generated hydrogen for powering a 
single family home with near zero emissions and noise-free fuel 
[10] . According to a recent work by Stern [10] , a large 160-cell hy- 
drogen generator can be employed to provide the total required 
energy for a single family home including power for appliances, 
lighting, electronics, and electric heat pumps for heating and cool- 
ing. A similar generator could be used to support the energy re- 
quirements of a small commercial entity such as a bank or phar- 
macy. 

Currently, hydrogen is primarily produced from fossil fuels such 
as  natural  gas  and  consequently,  CO 
2  is  generated  and  subse- 
quently  released  into  the  atmosphere  due  to  the  process.  How- 
ever, sustainable hydrogen production combined with carbon cap- 
ture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) technology could be a possible 
strategy for addressing CO 
2 generated from the transportation sec- 
tor [11] . For instance, using an alternative technology to SMR with 
2 production such as a mem- 
pressure swing adsorption (PSA) for H 
brane reactor (MR) has the potential to lead to H 
2 production on 
demand with subsequent CO 

2 storage on the vehicle [ 12 , 13 ]. 

Over the past 60 years, MR technology for H 

2  production has 
advanced signiﬁcantly. The rapid growth of research in this area 
can be judged by a signiﬁcant increase in citations in recent years.

As a special ﬁeld of interest, metallic membranes, speciﬁcally Pd 
and its alloys, have been heavily investigated in the hydrogen sep- 
aration ﬁeld due to their peculiar characteristic to allow for only 
hydrogen permeation making possible to produce a stream up to 
99.999 + % purity [14–16] . 

These advantageous characteristics could make metallic mem- 
branes and MRs suitable for onsite hydrogen production and sep- 
aration  to  satisfy  distributed  hydrogen  demands  for  mobile  and 
small-scale systems. However, despite several decades of research, 
most  metallic  membranes  have  remained  at  the  pilot  scale  due 
to  uncertain  economic  feasibility  and  competitiveness  at  a  large 
scale. Although the scientiﬁc literature on this topic is exception- 
ally rich, only few scientiﬁc studies have focused on the analysis 
of the costs, opportunities and challenges associated with indus- 
trial feasibility. Therefore, the aim of this review is to assess the 
potential and feasibility of metallic membranes and MRs toward 
utilization for hydrogen separation and production at high purity 
as well as to highlight the challenges that need to be overcome 
for accelerating widespread hydrogen use. Moreover, a comparison 
between metallic membranes and alternative hydrogen production 
and separation technologies is presented and discussed. 

2. Current status of hydrogen production, puriﬁcation, and 
usage 

2.1. Economics and scale 

According to a recent study by Dou et al., the global hydrogen 
market was estimated at $80 billion in 2015 and is expected to rise 
up to $1.6 trillion by 2050. Additionally, the study predicts that the 
market infrastructure will rise to $300 billion in 2030 and remain 
stable at this value until 2050 [17] . The primary market driver for 
the hydrogen economy is expected to come from HFCVs at a mar- 
ket value of $1.0 trillion in 2050, while the market value of station- 
ary hydrogen power generation is expected to rise to $200 billion 
during the same timeframe. Roughly 60% of the global hydrogen 
market share will be in North America, Europe, and China by 2050 
[17] . 

Another potential area that could drive the hydrogen market in 
the  near  future  is  the  concept  of  power-to-x  (P2X).  P2X  can  be 
deﬁned as processes for conversion of electricity, speciﬁcally elec- 
tricity that is generated from renewable energy resources such as 
wind or solar, into various products and/or applications to chem- 
ically store the electric energy during the low demand times and 
either use the products as feedstock for the production of other 
chemicals or convert them back to electricity during the peak de- 
mand periods. The letter “X” in the terminology could refer to gas, 
chemicals, fuel, methane, methanol, hydrogen, etc [18–20] . Among 
the P2X technologies, power-to-hydrogen (P2H) process is one of 
the most attractive ones where renewable or “green” hydrogen can 
be  produced  through  water  electrolysis  with  renewable  electric- 
ity. Hence, P2H could be the crucial link which closes the gap be- 
tween renewable electricity generation and large scale electricity 
storage [18] . It should be noted that P2H can be considered a low 
carbon energy concept, only if the electricity used in this process 
is supplied from non-fossil based and renewable energy resources 
such as wind or solar. In doing so, P2X can be considered as an 
approach that incorporates renewable energy into sectors such as 
transportation and industry. 

However,  it  should  be  noted  that  although  P2H  technologies 
have the potential to lower the carbon emissions, there are other 
environmental concerns associated with these chains that need to 
be taken into account. For instance, these technologies require sig- 
niﬁcant amount of materials such as steel, nickel, and polytetraﬂu- 

oroethylene (PTFE) i for use in electrolysis electrodes. Although not 
explicitly limited to the P2X technologies, there are other major 
environmental concerns that require further attention when con- 
sidering P2X chains. Hence, the implementation of P2X, like any 
other new technology, should be guided by accurate sustainabil- 
ity  assessments  taking  into  account  the  environmental  concerns 
such as ozone depletion, acidiﬁcation, and human toxicity [19] . An- 
other challenge associated with the P2H technologies is the diﬃ- 
culty for storage and transport of hydrogen. This challenge could 
be addressed by producing hydrogen in the proximity of chemical 
plants where it can be used as a feedstock for production of other 
chemicals such as ammonia. 

Currently, the use of hydrogen in the electricity and transporta- 
tion sectors in the U.S. is still developing. However, the expecta- 
tions for its evolution and utilization in the short term are evident 
in the stated objectives of the Hydrogen and Fuel Cells Program 
funded by the U.S. Department of Energy (U.S. DOE). Funding in 
this area reached a peak of approximately $270 million in 2008, 
with a low of $109 million in 2014. For the ﬁscal year 2017, the 
research budget saw an increase to $122 million [21] . The aim of 
the program is to fund research and development effort s to assess 
the viability of widespread implementation of fuel cell technolo- 
gies and a hydrogen energy infrastructure, ultimately in an effort 
to reduce the use of fossil fuels, mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions, and improve air quality [21] . 

The global demand for hydrogen is expected to remain constant 
up to 2025 at the current rate of 3.5% per year [22] . The current 
annual hydrogen production capacity in U.S. reﬁneries is approxi- 
mately 15.8 million tonnes. Of this volume, 3.3 million tonnes is 
captive  by-product  hydrogen  and  2  million  tonnes  is  combusted 
for heat generation. Hence, the total hydrogen capacity in the U.S. 
from conventional captive (hydrogen that is produced for internal 
use on the same site, such as oil reﬁneries) and merchant (hydro- 
gen that is produced by a producer and sold as a commodity and 
delivered to the consumer by pipeline, bulk tank or cylinder) mar- 
kets is approximately 11.0 million tonnes per year [23] . Nearly 95% 
of this amount is produced by the SMR process [24] . Globally, ap- 
proximately 50 million tonnes of hydrogen is produced each year 
[ 25 , 26 ].  Roughly  48%  comes  from  SMR,  30%  from  petroleum  re- 
forming, 18% from coal gasiﬁcation, and 4% from water electrolysis 
[27] . 

Hydrogen can be used in industrial processes for ammonia and 
methanol synthesis, fossil fuel hydrocracking, metal production, or 
as  a  fuel  for  HFCVs  and  rockets  [ 17 , 25 ].  Approximately  55%  of 
global  hydrogen  production  is  used  in  ammonia  plants  and  35% 
in petroleum reﬁning industries. The other end-use sectors include 
the electronics industry, metal/glass industries, the food industry, 
pharmaceuticals, etc. [ 28 , 29 ]. The breakdown of the hydrogen mar- 
ket end-use is shown in Figure 3 . 

The chemical manufacturing sector has a market share of ap- 
proximately 63%. Synthesis of ammonia requires high volumes of 
hydrogen and this process alone uses more than half of the hydro- 
gen market share. Reﬁneries have the second largest market share. 
In the last two decades, reﬁneries have become net hydrogen con- 
sumers [ 28 , 31 , 32 ] with typical capacities from 10,0 0 0 to 10 0,0 0 0 
m 3 /h [33] , accounting for 30% of the total hydrogen market. Hy- 
drogen is required for many operations in petrochemical process- 
ing  such  as  hydrotreating  (where  it  is  used  for  hydrodesulphur- 
ization,  hydroisomerization  and  hydrogenation  of  aromatics  and 
oleﬁns) and hydrocracking (where it breaks down large hydrocar- 
bons into smaller, and higher-value molecules) [34] . Until recently, 
hydrogen was available internally to industrial processes as a co- 
product from catalytic reforming of aromatics [ 31 , 32 ]. Today there 

i 

It should be noted that PTFE is not required for all electrolysis techniques.

is stricter control of gasoline aromatic composition, and therefore 
less hydrogen is produced within reﬁneries, limiting its availability 
[ 31 , 33 , 35 ]. Ultimately, this has catalyzed the push for reﬁners to 
increase the eﬃciency of their hydrogen production systems. 

Approximately 64% of hydrogen consumed in the industrial sec- 
tor is “captive” hydrogen which is produced and consumed on-site. 
Furthermore, the hydrogen that is produced as a by-product of in- 
dustrial processes, is also commercialized, and makes up 27% of 
the hydrogen market [36] . 

Based on today’s method of production, hydrogen does not rep- 
resent a shift away from fossil fuels, nor does it present itself as a 
complete solution to climate change [ 8 , 25 ]. In order to address cli- 
mate change concerns, alternative methods for hydrogen produc- 
tion such as electrolysis and photovoltaic water splitting, with re- 
newable sources of electricity, can be used to produce hydrogen 
rather than producing hydrogen using fossil fuels such as natural 
gas. However, some of these methods consume signiﬁcant amount 
of electricity, could suffer from toxicity ii of the generated products, 
and others such as photovoltaic water splitting, have low eﬃciency 
and have a very high production cost compared with the reforming 
process [37] . Nevertheless, there is ongoing research for alternative 
methods and devices to produce high-purity hydrogen, such as the 
new method and device invented by Ham et al., to produce hydro- 
gen in a dry reforming process using available methane and CO 
2 in 
biogas [38] . Moreover, a signiﬁcant infrastructure expansion would 
be valuable toward supporting its use as a transportation or grid 
fuel [ 39 , 40 ]. 

One of the biggest challenges that the hydrogen economy faces 
is the imbalance between hydrogen supply and demand. The cur- 
rent  global  production  volumes  of  hydrogen  cannot  support  a 
smooth transition from internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles 
to HFCVs. More speciﬁcally, in order to replace all the gasoline en- 
gine vehicles in the U.S. solely by HFCVs, the daily amount of pro- 
duced hydrogen should be approximately 0.34 million tonnes or 
124 million tonnes per year. This value is more than twice the cur- 
rent hydrogen that is consumed on a global scale and more than 
10 times the current annual U.S. production [25] . 

The other signiﬁcant challenge is hydrogen delivery and trans- 
portation. Although hydrogen can “potentially” be transported via 
pipelines like natural gas, the pipelines used for natural gas trans- 
port  are  not  suitable  for  hydrogen  delivery  due  to  serious  chal- 
lenges arising from hydrogen leakage and metal embrittlement un- 
der the high-pressure conditions required [25] . Furthermore, 1.2% 
of hydrogen energy will be used every 150 km to power the com- 
pressors which is 4 times the amount of natural gas used for the 
same purpose, i.e. 0.3% [41] . High costs of pipeline delivery and

generated in photo arsenic electrodes. [37] 

distribution, material handling losses, increased traﬃc congestion, 
and safety issues associated with highly ﬂammable and explosive 
hydrogen gas are some of the biggest concerns that will need to be 
addressed thoroughly for successful deployment of hydrogen en- 
ergy [ 25 , 41 , 42 ]. 

A SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) analysis 
of hydrogen energy in China indicates the strengths of a hydrogen 
economy include: [43] 

• Abundant resources to produce hydrogen from: coal, oil, natural 

gas, biomass, waste water, wind, hydropower, solar etc. 

• Great  development  potential  (transportation  and  communica- 

tion) 

• Environmental  beneﬁts  (as  the  greatest  CO 

2  emitter,  China 
needs  to  reform  its  energy  structure  toward  more  renewable 
and clean resources to address the ever-increasing problem of 
the air pollution in its major cities) 

In  the  same  report,  the  weaknesses  of  hydrogen  energy  are 

listed as following: 

• High cost 
• Lack of key technologies (China currently lacks the state-of-the- 
art technologies and infrastructures to use renewable sources 
such as wind and solar for hydrogen production) 

• Lack of the appropriate infrastructure (refueling and transporta- 

tion infrastructure are missing) 

Although  this  SWOT  analysis  is  performed  for  the  Chinese 
market, many of its elements such as abundance, environmental 
friendliness,  costs,  and  lack  of  infrastructure  are  valid  for  other 
countries as well, including the U.S. 

2.2. Current industrial production and separation technologies 

The SMR is currently the dominant industrial method for hy- 
drogen  production  where  methane  and  steam  react  over  a  cat- 
alyst  to  produce  a  mixture  of  H 
2  [ 12 , 44–53 ].  SMR  has 
developed into speciﬁcally tailored processes, consisting of a con- 
ventional reformer followed by two water-gas shift (WGS) reactors 
(i.e., high temperature shift (HTS) and low temperature shift (LTS)) 
and equipment for H 
2 separation and puriﬁcation, with PSA being 
the dominant technique. Figure 4 shows a schematic of the entire 
process. 

2  and  CO 

The reaction between methane and steam takes place in the re- 
former at harsh operating conditions due to the endothermic na- 
ture  of  the  reaction.  Speciﬁcally,  the  operating  temperature  and 
pressure ranges between 800 °C to 10 0 0 °C and 15 to 20 bar, re- 
spectively [54] .

The stream exiting the reformer contains a hydrogen-rich gas 
mixture with substantial CO content (generally higher than 5 vol.%) 
[55] , which may be suppressed by the WGS reaction: 
CO + H 2 O (cid:2) C O 2 + H 2 

(3) 

This  reaction  takes  place  in  two  reactors  arranged  in  series 
since it is an exothermic reaction promoted at low temperature, 
but  kinetically-limited  at  temperatures  below  ca.  200  °C  [56] . 
Therefore, the ﬁrst reactor (HTS) operates at high temperature be- 
tween  310-450  °C  and  uses  a  high-temperature  catalyst  such  as 
chromium-promoted iron oxide to favor the kinetics [57] . The sec- 
ond reactor (LTS) operates at low temperature in the range of 190 
to 250 °C and uses a low-temperature catalyst of copper-promoted 
zinc oxide [58] . The outlet stream from the LTS reactor contains 
4 on a dry basis [ 59 , 60 ]. 
86% H 
Therefore, in order to obtain high-grade hydrogen, different sepa- 
ration/puriﬁcation steps using diverse technology can be used, as 
shown in Table 1. Each technology is chosen according to the hy- 
drogen purity requirements for any speciﬁc process. For instance, 
cryogenic  distillation,  which  uses  the  difference  in  boiling  point

temperatures  of  the  species  is  a  very  energy  intensive  process 
[61] due to operating at very low temperatures and therefore does 
not allow for signiﬁcant hydrogen puriﬁcation [62] . However, cryo- 
genic  separation  processes  have  better  economies  of  scale  com- 
pared to the other separation methods and can produce separate 
+ , ethane, propane, etc. [63] .

Palladium-based membrane technology allows for high recov- 
ery and high purity of hydrogen. The primary challenges associ- 
ated  with  Pd-based  membranes  for  H 
2  production  include  their 
low tolerance for H 
2 S and unsaturated hydrocarbons, high cost on 
a large scale due to the price of Pd, and low mechanical resistance 
[66] . Today, the most extensively used technology for large-scale 
production is the PSA process [62] . The PSA technology allows for 
variation in H 
2 purity making it tunable for a wide range of indus- 
trial applications [54] . Sorbents that are commonly used include 
activated carbon, silica gel, alumina and zeolite [67–69] . The PSA 
process operates at approximately 20-25 bar [ 70 , 71 ] and has a hy- 
drogen separation eﬃciency of 85-90% [72] . Moreover, PSA tech- 
nology has the ability to process large capacities of feed gas, i.e., 
on the order of 10 0,0 0 0 m 3 /h [73] while maintaining a hydrogen 
purity  of  99.999 + %  [70] .  More  speciﬁcally,  a  10 0,0 0 0  m 3 /h  unit 
2  per year, which amounts to 
would produce 78,0 0 0 tonnes of H

2  production. iii  While  PSA 
approximately  0.2%  of  annual  global  H 
has many beneﬁts, it has the drawback of relatively low hydrogen 
recovery  (approximately  70%) iv  [74] .  The  savings  associated  with 
using a dense Pd membrane and achieving a hydrogen recovery of 
99% are worth noting. By using this technology, 36% less natural 
gas can be used to produce the same amount of hydrogen, result- 
ing in an annual savings of 11,0 0 0 tonnes of natural gas and $2 
2 emis- 
million per PSA unit. Furthermore, more than 31,0 0 0 of CO 
sions could be avoided annually. v 

Recent  studies  have  investigated  alternative  solutions  to  the 
conventional system, such as the adoption of membrane technol- 
ogy applied to the SMR reaction [75–91] . It has been demonstrated 
that the use of a hydrogen permeability-selective MR such as Pd- 
based MR [ 62 , 92 ] could allow for working at milder operating con- 
ditions and enhancing the performance of the SMR reaction, while 
additionally  collecting  high-purity  hydrogen  [93] .  The  interest  in 
MR technology has grown due to its potential to provide signiﬁ- 
cant process improvements such as operational simplicity, compat- 
ibility between different membrane operations in integrated sys- 
tems,  low  energy  requirements  and  environmental  compatibility. 
Membrane technology provides process intensiﬁcation by combin- 
ing reaction and separation steps in a single device, while simulta- 
neously achieving higher conversions and eﬃciencies compared to 
conventional separation and reaction operations [94] . 

2.3. Hydrogen use and the role of metallic membranes 

Hydrogen’s clean combustion and high energy density (hydro- 
gen has the highest mass energy density in all types of fossil fuels, 
120  MJ/kg  at  its  lower  limit  heating  value)  make  it  very  attrac- 
tive for sustainable development [17] . As a clean fuel, hydrogen can 
be used in cogeneration systems for industries and households to 
mitigate air pollution associated with other combustion fuels [17] . 
Most of the applications of hydrogen stem from its reactivity rather 
than its physical properties. 

One area that has been very attractive and has created signiﬁ- 
cant momentum for research and development projects in the past 
20 years [95] is the use of hydrogen in the HFCVs. HFCVs could be 
attractive to the customers as they combine the beneﬁts of electric 
vehicles, like quietness and eﬃciency, with those of theICE vehi- 
cles, such as refueling time and driving range. Given the 700 bar 
on-board hydrogen storage requirement, a HFCV can be refueled 
within 3-5 minutes, which is enough for driving 40 0-50 0 km [96] . 
The energy conversion eﬃciency of HFCVs can be as high as 40- 
60% vi while only 10-15% of the gasoline in the conventional ICE is 
converted to traction energy [97] . 

Table  2 shows  a  comparison  between  energy  storage  capacity, 
discharge time, and siting of hydrogen and other forms of energy 
storage. As can be seen, hydrogen is superior to all other forms of 
energy storage from both storage capacity and discharge duration. 
However, the fundamental issues stemming from the low volu- 
metric energy density of hydrogen gas, make the development of

Hydrogen recovery is lower compared to other hydrogen separation techniques 

as a fraction of hydrogen is lost in the purging step. [65]

Assumptions: Natural gas is considered pure methane; PSA (90% conversion, 
70% recovery); Membrane (99% conversion, 99% recovery); price of natural gas set at 
3.268 $/MMBtu; Standard conditions are assumed to be 15.56 °C and 1.01325 bar; 
carbon emissions associated with burning natural gas are assumed to be 0.0053 
tonnes of CO 2 /therm 

Eﬃciencies are based on higher heating values (HHV). It should be noted that 
for a power-to-fuel scenario where electricity is transformed into hydrogen, which 
is then used in a HFCV, the overall eﬃciency from well to wheel could be as low as 
20-30% due to the losses in each conversion step from electricity to hydrogen and 
back to electricity. [98] In such scenarios, electric vehicles may be a better alternative 
to the HFCVs if the electricity is provided by renewable sources. 

HFCVs a challenging task. Hydrogen has a signiﬁcantly lower vol- 
umetric  fuel  density  compared  to  gasoline  and  diesel  oil,  which 
makes  its  delivery  more  diﬃcult  and  costly.  The  feasible  modes 
of transportation for hydrogen are via tube trailers, tanker trucks 
and  pipelines.  The  only  delivery  method  that  makes  hydrogen 
emission-free is pipeline transport [99] . 

One of the most important challenges that keeps HFCVs from 
being commercially available is the cost associated with onboard 
storage of hydrogen. A HFCV requires 4-7 kg of hydrogen to drive a 
distance of 480 km. Currently, a carbon-ﬁber composite tank pres- 
surized to 700 bar is the best storage material for passenger ve- 
hicles which costs approximately $3,0 0 0 with today’s technology 
[100] . 

One technology that may make a signiﬁcant difference in mak- 
ing  the  hydrogen  economy  a  reality  in  the  coming  decades  is 
SMR combined with MR technology. This, however, requires major 
breakthroughs  in  membrane  technology  development.  Industrial 
interest towards membrane technology has grown over the years. 
Currently, metallic membranes are already being used on an indus- 
trial  scale  in  the  semiconductor  industry  to  produce  high-purity 
hydrogen [101] . Commercial polymeric membranes have been ef- 
fectively employed since 1979 [102] and currently compete with 
PSA  and  cryogenic  separation  on  an  industrial  scale  for  recover- 
ing hydrogen from reﬁneries, ammonia plants, and petrochemical 
manufacturing [103–105] . Polymeric membranes achieve high hy- 
drogen purity reaching 95%, as reported in Table 1 , which is usu- 
ally adequate [106] for most petroleum reﬁning applications. Nev- 
ertheless, for some catalytic processes such as ammonia synthesis 
and for supplying fuel cells, e.g., PEMFCs, ultra-high purity hydro- 
gen of 99.99 + % is required [107] . For these applications, Pd-based 
membranes could be employed due to their complete selectivity 
towards hydrogen permeation with respect to other gases. 

The  performance  of  Pd-based  alloy  membranes  has  more  re- 
cently been enhanced by decreasing the thickness of the metal- 
lic layer. The transition from a thick, unsupported membrane to a 
thin, supported membrane has led to economic beneﬁts and higher 
purity  hydrogen  in  the  permeate.  Despite  recent  improvements, 
they  are  still  affected  by  relatively  high  cost  due  to  membrane 
production and operation, especially at industrial scales [106] , and 
compared  to  the  polymeric  membranes  they  are  expected  to  be 
one  to  three  orders  of  magnitude  more  expensive  per  unit  sur- 
face  area  [104] .  For  example,  spiral-wound  turnkey  membrane 
skids used in natural gas processing plants cost $500/m 2 vii [108] , 
while  the  cost  of  one  50  μm-thick  Pd  membrane,  would  be  ca. 
$5,500/m 2 viii  [109] .  Nevertheless,  at  the  same  pressure  gradient, 
Pd-based membranes are characterized by superior selectivity and 
permeability, which can be ca. 10 0 0-10,0 0 0 times higher than poly- 
meric membranes [110] . Therefore, the cost of metallic membranes 
based  on  the  same  amount  of  hydrogen  permeating  ﬂux  would 
yield a competitive result in comparison to polymeric membranes. 
One  of  the  obstacles  that  Pd-based  membranes  could  face  at 
industrial scale is their inability to produce high ﬂow rates of hy- 
drogen compared with PSA technology which currently produces 
hydrogen  ﬂow  rates  as  high  as  10,0 0 0-10 0,0 0 0  m 3 /h  [33] ,  on  a 
large-scale industrial basis. This problem inherently stems from the 
challenges associated with scaling up the MR technology. Although 
the process capacity may be expanded with additional membrane 
units  to  increase  the  hydrogen  ﬂow  rate,  it  is  not  cost-effective 
for Pd-based membranes. However, Pd-based membranes may be 
suitable for small applications where the beneﬁts of their perfor- 
mance outweigh the membrane cost [104] . Such applications, some 

Polymer membrane cost was converted from 12.5 million dollars (2007 USD) 

Cost of Pd was chosen for the cheapest price in 2010, and 10% of preparation

3. Metallic membranes and recent progress 

3.1. Metallic membranes and hydrogen permeation 

Membranes  used  for  H 

2  separation  can  be  divided  into  four 
categories based on the materials used in their fabrication: poly- 
meric, metallic, carbon, and ceramic. Polymeric membranes are or- 
ganic while the other three classiﬁcations are considered inorganic 
membranes [62] . Dense metallic membranes such as Pd and Pt as 
well as the metallic elements of groups III-V are of special interest 
due to their capability to produce pure H 
2 in one single separation 
step with a low energy penalty [114] . The best candidates are Pd- 
based metallic membranes for producing high-purity hydrogen due 
to their “inﬁnite” selectivity towards H 
2 permeation [115] . Hydro- 
gen permeation through Pd is governed by the solution-diffusion 
mechanism which takes place in six steps [ 116 , 117 ]. 

Hydrogen  transport  through  the  Pd  membrane  can  be  either 
surface-limited or diffusion-limited. In thick membranes ( δ > 100 
μm),  the  rate-limiting  step  is  usually  the  diffusion  of  hydrogen 
atoms through the bulk of Pd [118] , while in thin membranes ( δ
< 1.0 μm) and at high operating pressures the rates of surface re- 
actions dictate the rate of transport [ 109 , 118 ]. However, it is worth 
mentioning that at low temperatures the associative desorption of 
hydrogen atoms from the Pd surface become the rate-determining 
step, while at very low hydrogen partial pressures ( << 1.0 bar), the 
adsorption of hydrogen atoms onto the Pd surface might become 
the rate-limiting step [ 119 , 120 ]. 

When the limiting step is hydrogen diffusion, the hydrogen per- 
meating ﬂux through the dense Pd-based membrane can be ex- 
pressed by Sieverts-Fick’s law:

where J H2 is the hydrogen permeating ﬂux through the membrane, 
Pe H2 is the permeability of the membrane, p H2,ret and p H2,perm are 
the  partial  pressure  of  hydrogen  in  the  retentate  and  permeate 
sides, respectively, and δ is the membrane thickness. 

Permeability is an intrinsic property of the membrane and is 
independent of the thickness of the membrane or the partial pres- 
sure of hydrogen. In some instances, the “permeance” is used to 
characterize its performance and is deﬁned as the ratio of perme- 
ability over thickness:

It  is  worth  noting  that  permeance  is  mainly  used  to  charac- 
terize a thin metallic ﬁlm deposited on a porous support, while 
permeability is generally used for the characterization of unsup- 
ported membranes [109] . The membrane permeability is a func- 
tion of temperature and may be described by an Arrhenius-type 

relationship [ 77 , 121–124 ]:

Where Pe 0 

H2  is the pre-exponential factor, E a  is the apparent 
activation  energy,  R  is  the  universal  gas  constant,  and  T  is  the 
absolute temperature. Combining equations (4) and ( 6 ) yields the 
Richardson’s equation [ 123 , 124 ]:

This relationship highlights the proportionality of the hydrogen 
permeating ﬂux to the membrane thickness, hydrogen partial pres- 
sure,  and  temperature,  which  need  to  be  optimized  to  obtain  a 
high hydrogen permeating ﬂux. 

Although the Sieverts-Fick’s law is fairly simple, there are nu- 
merous  studies  that  undermine  its  validity  and  use  the  general 
empirical  form  where  the  hydrogen  permeating  ﬂux  is  propor- 
tional  to  the  partial  pressure  of  hydrogen  to  the  power  of  n 
[ 93 , 118 , 123 , 125 ].

The empirical exponent n in equation (8) is a dependent fac- 
tor which determines the correlation between the hydrogen per- 
meating ﬂux and the driving force (partial pressure of hydrogen 
on the retentate and permeate sides). The value of n, varies be- 
tween 0.5 and 1.0 [87], and is usually evaluated using nonlinear 
regression  technics  [126] .  Although  controversial,  the  value  of  n 
has been used as a benchmark to determine the rate controlling 
steps. The deviation of n values from 0.5 may be explained by the 
deviation of the hydrogen solubility from the values proposed by 
Sieverts’ law, which may results from incorrect assumptions of the 
rate-determining steps, non-ideality of interstitial hydrogen diffu- 
sivity, or crystallographic phase transition [123] . In addition, a de- 
viation from 0.5 indicates that the permeation of hydrogen may 
be inﬂuenced by a combination of other factors such as Pd surface 
impurities, bulk defects, i.e., organic contaminants from fabrication 
or pinholes, respectively [ 105 , 127 ]. 

Equation (8) is usually used to evaluate the permeation char- 
acteristics of composite membranes, which consist of a thin Pd- 
layer deposited on a porous support. Porous supports are typically 
porous stainless steel (PSS) or ceramic [128] . The beneﬁts in the 
use of a PSS support are the mechanical and chemical resistance 
of the support, the thermal expansion of PSS being similar to that 
of Pd and ease in implementing it within a module. However, they 
suffer from intermetallic diffusion, rough surface area, and broad 
pore size distribution, which makes the deposition of a thin dense 
layer diﬃcult. On the contrary, ceramic supports offer narrow pore 
size distribution, stability over a wide range of temperatures, and 
they are chemically inert. Nevertheless, they suffer from differing 
thermal expansion coeﬃcients, high costs and diﬃculty in imple- 
menting within a module [ 64 , 128 ]. 

A common characteristic of Pd-based membranes is their ability 
to be completely hydrogen perm-selective with respect to all the 
other gases.The parameter commonly used to evaluate this feature

3.2. Pd-alloy membranes and costs 

Alloy-based membranes have gained increasing interest due to 
their improved properties compared to pure Pd such as sulfur re- 
sistivity, thermal stability, and enhanced hydrogen permeability, as 
well as their generally lower material cost and decreased embrit- 
tlement tendency [ 109 , 130 , 131 ]. The abundance and cost of various 
metals that are commonly used to fabricate Pd-based alloy mem- 
branes for the purpose of hydrogen production are shown in Figure 
5 . Furthermore, the permeability of these Pd alloy membranes at 
350 °C and 2.2 MPa are depicted in Figure 6 . From these graphs it 
can be inferred that, alloying Pd with other metals offers a reason- 
able compromise between the material cost of the membrane and 
the permeability of hydrogen through the membrane. 

One  of  the  most  widely  used  Pd  alloy  membranes  that  has 
23% membrane 

shown high permeability and stability is the Pd 
[132] . 

77% Ag 

The  hydrogen  permeabilities  of  various  Pd-based  membranes 
reported in recent literature are shown in Table 4 . Since the per- 

meability depends not only on the type of alloy but also on their 
composition, fabrication methods, and testing procedures, compar- 
ing permeabilities across different studies provides only an approx- 
imate trend. The most widely studied Pd-based alloy membranes 
are Pd-Ag, some of which are applied to MR technology [133–135] . 
In general, Pd-Ag membranes provide 1.5-2 times higher hydrogen 
permeability compared to pure Pd due to their increased hydro- 
gen solubility. In addition, Pd-Ag membranes have demonstrated 
higher resistance against hydrogen embrittlement. 

Aside from enhancing membrane transport properties, another 
purpose  of  alloying  is  to  improve  chemical  stability  against  sul- 
fur  contamination.  The  Pd-Cu  alloy  has  achieved  higher  toler- 
ance against sulfur contamination, with the permeability similar or 
slightly lower than that of pure Pd. The face-centered cubic (FCC) 
phase of the Pd-Cu alloy containing 30-60 wt.% Cu has been found 
to have increased tolerance against sulfur poisoning compared to 
the body-centered cubic (BCC) phase, in which hydrogen perme- 
ability has been found to remain constant at 1,0 0 0 ppm H 
2 S ex- 
posure [136] . The extent of sulfur tolerance varies among the var- 
ious studies reported in the literature. For instance, a concentra- 
2 S completely inhibited hydrogen permeation 
tion of 300 ppm of H 
through Pd-Cu membranes while only 100 ppm of H 
2 S inhibited 
permeation in pure Pd membranes [137] . In addition, 80%, 20% and 
1% loss in hydrogen permeation were reported for various Pd-Cu 
2 S, respectively [138–
membranes at 50 ppm, 20 ppm and 5 ppm H 
140] .  Since  these  experimental  results  are  compiled  from  differ- 
ent studies, the effect of H 
2 S concentration may not appear as a 
quantitative correlation with the decrease in permeation, but the 
2 S.  In 
overall  trend  qualitatively  shows  the  inhibition  effect  of  H 
addition, Pd-Au alloy membranes with low Au compositions ( < 10 
wt%) have also exhibited enhanced sulfur resistance [141] . The hy- 
drogen permeation dropped to 15% of the initial ﬂux at 55 ppm 
H 
2 S, but soon recovered to 65% with hydrogen purging, whereas 
the  hydrogen  permeation  through  a  pure  Pd  membrane  was  re- 
duced to 7% under the same H 
2 S concentration without recovery 
after 20 hours of purging under hydrogen [142] . Another promis- 
ing alloy exhibiting sulfur resistance is Pd-Pt. However, a content of 
Pt between 10 and 30 wt% exhibited decreased permeability (i.e., 
20-60% of the permeability of pure Pd), while demonstrating im-

proved sulfur tolerance; for instance, 30% permeation loss was re- 
ported at 1,0 0 0 ppm H 
2 S at 400 °C [ 143 , 144 ]. Without bulk sul- 
ﬁde formation, the permeability of sulfur-tolerant membranes can 
be  partially  or  fully  recovered  after  ﬂushing  with  a  pure  hydro- 
gen stream [ 138 , 141 , 142 , 145 ]. In order to achieve higher hydrogen 
permeability while maintaining sulfur resistance, alloys with more 
than two elements have also been investigated, including Pd-Ag-Cu 
[146–148] , Pd-Ag-Au [ 141 , 149 ], and Pd-Au-Pt [150] . Permeabilities 
of these ternary alloys are also listed in Table 4 . 

3.3. Non-Pd membranes 

Non-precious metal alloys for hydrogen separation have been 
studied as  a way to  reduce the use  of  precious metals.  A  range 
of hydrogen permeabilities for non-Pd membranes from the litera- 
ture is listed in Table 5 . The alloy Zr 
64 was the ﬁrst amorphous 
metal  alloy  membrane  introduced  by  Hara  et  al.,  demonstrating

membrane [158] . Hydrogen permeabilities tend to increase along 
with a Zr content in amorphous metal alloys [ 159 , 160 ]. Superior 
hydrogen permeability may also be achieved by using crystalline 
alloys of early transition metals with the BCC structure, such as 
the Group 5 metals (e.g., V, Nb, and Ta) [161–163] . It should be 
noted that the presence of a catalytic Pd layer is often required 
for such high permeation levels of hydrogen through these metals. 
Group  5  metals  have  high  surface  resistance  for  hydrogen  entry 
and exit [162] , but a thin Pd layer (several hundred nanometers) 
coated upon the surfaces of those metals allows for rapid hydrogen 
dissociation and subsequent bulk diffusion. Some Zr-Ni amorphous 
alloys have reactive surfaces, which allow for hydrogen dissociation 
thereby eliminating the use of precious metals [158] . 

The  increased  permeability  of  the  crystalline  and  amorphous 
metal alloys can be largely attributed to their high hydrogen solu- 
bility [109] . However, the high solubility is often correlated to the 
susceptibility of potential hydrogen embrittlement. As the hydro- 
gen concentration rises, the precipitation of new hydride phases

occurs, and the stress along phase boundaries potentially increases, 
leading to defects and cracks in metals [164] . To reduce the embrit- 
tlement induced by this dual phase, alloying with less hydrogen- 
soluble  metals,  such  as  Ni,  has  been  reported  in  the  literature 
[165–169] . It was found that the presence of the less hydrogen- 
soluble  additive  metals  suppresses  the  formation  of  the  hydride 
phases, thereby limiting hydrogen embrittlement. Another impor- 
tant  property  of  membrane  material  is  the  thermal  stability  for 
high-temperature  operation.  The  thermal  stability  may  be  en- 
hanced when a refractory metal (e.g., Nb, Ta, Mo, or W) is con- 
tained in alloys [170] . Even though these non-Pd membranes are at 
a premature stage compared to the Pd-based membranes, more re- 
search should continue since the impact of these new membranes 
on  cost  reduction  could  be  very  signiﬁcant  and  more  advanced 
membrane properties (e.g., permeability, chemical and thermal sta- 
bility) may be achieved. 

3.4. Eﬃcient material screening 

Various  metallic  membrane  materials  have  been  used  and 
tested as discussed previously in sections 3.2 and 3.3 . Despite the 
existence of a vast amount of experimental data on membrane fab- 
rication and permeation tests, a direct, quantitative comparison of 
the  properties  among  various  membranes  from  different  studies 
is often diﬃcult and at times not possible due to differing mea- 
surement conditions and different units used among the various 
studies. It may be useful if studies could apply a standard mea- 
sure of sulfur tolerance among different membranes; for example, 
it could be a fraction of permeation loss at a H 
2 S concentration 
of 500 ppm compared to the original permeance in the absence 
of H 
2 S. This availability of well-organized standard lab-scale data 
across various research groups may accelerate further development 
of the new membranes through eﬃcient communication and accu- 
rate comparisons, preventing duplicated experiments on the same 
or less desirable membrane materials. 

Finding an optimal alloy and its composition through experi- 
ments is challenging since there are a limited number of tests that 

can be carried out within a reasonable timeframe while using ﬁ- 
nite resources. In addition to individual experimental tests to in- 
form  the  design  of  an  optimal  membrane,  high-throughput  ma- 
terial screening has been attempted, in which alloys of multiple 
compositions are created and characterized on a small scale for ef- 
ﬁcient analyses [ 184 , 185 ]. 

Another method for eﬃcient material screening is based on a 
computational approach, which does not involve collecting exper- 
imental  data.  Membrane  properties,  such  as  permeability,  phase 
stability, and sulfur resistance, have been simulated through com- 
putational  modeling.  First-principles  calculations  combined  with 
statistical mechanics methods have been used to predict hydrogen 
solubility and diffusivity to determine the permeability of Pd-based 
[186–188] and amorphous metal-based [189–191] membranes. This 
computational approach enables searching through a vast range of 
material compositions to select new membrane materials having 
enhanced permeability. Hao and Sholl have shown that the predic- 
tions often agree with experimentally measured permeabilities to 
within an order of magnitude; however, considering that the ex- 
perimental permeability can vary signiﬁcantly depending on mi- 
crostructure  variations  even  within  the  same  alloy  compositions 
[ 93 , 105 , 192 ], this may not always be the case. The accuracy of pre- 
dictions varies across different metal-hydrogen systems, as do the 
models used in the simulations. These computational approaches 
suffer  from  intrinsic  errors  associated  with  the  approximate  na- 
ture  of  potentials  that  describe  interactions  among  electrons  or 
atoms, with which we solve equations of motion (Newton’s equa- 
tion  for  molecular  dynamics  calculations,  or  approximations  to 
Schrödinger’s  equation  for  electronic  structure  calculations)  per- 
taining to many-body systems to obtain ground-state energies and 
optimized geometries [193] . In addition, the errors may result from 
numerical  approximations  in  solving  those  equations.  Therefore, 
one should be careful in making comparisons, and it is more ap- 
propriate, in general, to compare trends between experimental and 
theoretical properties of materials rather than between particular 
experimental data points and the corresponding theoretical predic- 
tions.

3.5. Theoretical studies on metallic membrane materials 

Electronic structure calculations have provided mechanistic un- 
derstanding of hydrogen-metal interactions, which cannot be eas- 
ily demonstrated experimentally. Theoretical studies have revealed 
that hydrogen binding in subsurface layers of a metallic lattice re- 
sults in a very stable state in most transition metals and that over- 
coming an activation barrier is often required for subsequent dif- 
fusion [194] . Hydrogen diffusion in the bulk phase between two 
interstitial sites, i.e., octahedral and tetrahedral sites, also involves 
an activation barrier [195] and possibly charge state variations be- 
tween  charged  and  neutral  states  [196] .  In  fact,  a  high  charge 
density associated with hydrogen in metals may be correlated to 
strong hydrogen absorption, for instance, in the case of hydrogen 
in Group 5 metals and their alloys [197] . The phase stability of vir- 
tual alloy membrane materials has been evaluated by comparing 
alloy  formation  energies,  segregation  energies,  and  charge  inter- 
actions [ 198 , 199 ]. Phase diagrams of Pd-based alloys in the pres- 
ence of hydrogen or sulfur have been estimated by rigorous ther- 
modynamic modeling combined with ﬁrst-principles calculations, 
thereby further assessing the thermodynamic stability of materials 
under  given  temperature  and  pressure  conditions  [ 200 , 201 ].  The 
interaction between sulfur and membrane surfaces has been inves- 
tigated through ﬁrst-principles calculations that have provided the 
sulfur adsorption energy, release temperature, and segregation ten- 
dency of sulfur compounds [ 199 , 202 ]. Electronic coupling between 
the sulfur p-orbital and the metal d-band (valence electronic state 
of transition metals) was found to be the primary mode of interac- 
tion correlating directly to the sulfur adsorption strength [ 202 , 203 ]. 
Therefore, tuning the sulfur aﬃnity through alloying of metals with 
different  d-band  centers  (along  the  energy  state  with  respect  to 
Fermi-level) may be possible. A fundamental understanding of the 
interactions  between  membrane  materials  and  gases  may  aid  in 
the design of new materials with optimal properties and further 
may lead to the discovery of advanced membrane materials. 

4. Metallic membrane opportunities for next-generation 
applications 

4.1. Small-scale industrial applications 

For smaller and emerging hydrogen markets such as the semi- 
conductor  and  fuel  cell  industries,  the  use  of  Pd-based  mem- 
branes is appropriate due to the scales and purity requirements. 
First,  these  applications  are  small-  to  medium-scale  with  capac- 
ities  ranging  from  5  to  1,0 0 0  m 3 /h  [33] ,  more  than  100  times 
smaller than large-scale applications such as reﬁning and ammonia 
production. The inherent compactness of membrane units would 
enable  on-site  production  of  hydrogen  for  applications  on  these 
scales.  Alternatively,  distributed  small-scale users  can  source  hy- 
drogen from large-scale plants at a reasonable production cost [33] , 
but the high cost of distribution would make this option less at- 
tractive. The distribution cost of hydrogen is 15 times higher than 
that of liquid hydrocarbon fuels on a mass basis primarily due to 
2  distribu- 
higher  pumping  costs  [24] .  If  CCUS  is  considered,  CO 
tion to sequestration sites would contribute to the cost of small- 
scale production units. In this case, Sjardin et al. concluded from a 
techno-economic study that at a hydrogen production scale below 
40 MW ( ca. 12,300 m 3 /h ix ), MRs with CCUS ($19/GJ) would become 
2 production ($18/GJ) [204] . On-site 
competitive with centralized H 
hydrogen production would also provide self-suﬃcient supply and 
further circumvent delivery delays as well as issues with storage

[302] and the molar volume of an ideal gas at 298 K. 

safety. Nevertheless, higher production costs due to smaller pro- 
duction sizes and safety concerns over local production and han- 
dling of hydrogen as an explosive gas should be taken into con- 
sideration [25] . Secondly, fuel cell and semiconductor applications 
require hydrogen of very high purities. In semiconductor manufac- 
turing, hydrogen is used as a carrier gas for trace doping elements 
[16] , and hydrogen of near absolute purity (99.999999%) is needed 
[ 16 , 106 ].  For  PEMFCs,  CO  impurities  in  the  hydrogen  feed  could 
strongly adsorb onto the catalyst, leading to catalyst deactivation 
and cell performance deterioration [ 15 , 205 , 206 ]. A CO concentra- 
tion of as low as 2 ppm has been recommended by the U.S. DOE 
for hydrogen used in onboard vehicle fuel cells [15] , which corre- 
sponds to a hydrogen purity of 99.999 + %. Such high purities are 
readily available from dense Pd-based membranes, which have a 
theoretically complete selectivity towards hydrogen [ 15 , 204 , 207 ]. 

4.2. Power generation and large-scale hydrogen production 

2 capture is considered for H 

A foreseeable large-scale application of hydrogen is to be used 
as  a  low-carbon  energy  resource  for  electricity  generation.  This 
would  differ  from  the  current  use  of  hydrogen,  which  is  as  a 
coolant  for  turbo  generators  [208–212] .  When  used  as  a  fuel 
gas, high-pressure hydrogen [213] with a purity of less than 80% 
[ 106 , 214 ] is favored for conventional gas turbines. This hydrogen 
purity is necessary for maintaining a moderate ﬂame temperature 
[ 108 , 215 ] to suppress NO x  formation in the combustion chamber 
[ 70 , 108 , 215 ], as current NO x reduction technology in gas turbines 
cannot be used for hydrogen combustion [70] . If pre-combustion 
CO 
2 separation, membrane tech- 
2 /CO 
nology may be employed. In this case, a nitrogen or steam sweep 
gas  can  be  used  to  increase  the  separation  driving  force  by  de- 
creasing the permeate-side hydrogen partial pressure [ 70 , 213 , 215 ] 
in addition to reducing the required membrane surface area [215] . 
The sweep gas will also act as a diluent to control the ﬂame tem- 
perature and reduce NO x levels [ 108 , 215 ] as previously discussed. 
Since high purity is not a requirement for power generation, highly 
selective  Pd-based  membranes  would  lose  their  advantage  com- 
pared to other membrane materials. For example, it has been esti- 
mated that a H 
2 /N 
2 
selectivity from 130 to 870 would be suﬃcient for integrated gasi- 
ﬁcation  combined  cycle  (IGCC)  plants  [213] .  The  more  stringent 
2 into the 
H 
CO 
2 pipeline trans- 
port and sequestration [213] . These selectivity requirements allow 
for  a  wider  range  of  materials  to  be  used,  such  as  ceramic  and 
polymeric membranes [213] . 

2 /N 
2 -rich stream to meet the speciﬁcations for CO 

2 selectivity is needed to prevent back-diffusion of N 

2 selectivity ranging from 20 to 60 and a H 

2 /CO 

Although  the  high  operating  temperature  of  Pd-based  mem- 
branes,  e.g.,  30 0-60 0  °C,  is  compatible  with  exhaust  streams  of 
power plant applications, the high temperature range is not unique 
to  metallic  membranes.  For  example,  an  operating  temperature 
of  400  °C  is  accessible  to  microporous  silica  hydrogen-selective 
membranes  [ 62 , 106 ]  or  even  some  high-temperature  polymeric 
hydrogen-selective  membranes.  A  common  disadvantage  of  the 
hydrogen-selective membrane technology for turbine applications 
is that the hydrogen product exits the membrane from the low- 
pressure  permeate  side,  which  makes  recompression  necessary 
thereby imposing additional costs [ 104 , 105 , 216 , 217 ]. 

Other separation technologies such as physical absorption, e.g., 
2  capture. 
Selexol,  have  also  been  studied  for  pre-combustion  CO 
2  after  the  WGS  reactor  makes 
The  high  partial  pressure  of  CO 
2  a suitable approach for capturing car- 
physical absorption of CO 
bon  [70] .  Computational  modeling  studies  have  shown  that  Pd- 
based  membranes  do  not  have  a  distinct  advantage  over  physi- 
cal absorption in terms of plant eﬃciency and costs. For example, 
40 MR 
Chiesa et al. concluded that an IGCC system with a Pd 
is more eﬃcient by nearly 1.7% than a reference IGCC plant using 

60 Cu 

14

Selexol for carbon capture [215] . Amelio et al. found that a Pd-Ag 
membrane–based IGCC plant has a slightly lower eﬃciency than 
an IGCC plant using a Selexol separation process. The reason for 
this lower eﬃciency is due to the fact that the membrane-based 
IGCC system consumes a larger fraction of its generated power for 
CO 
2 compression and for producing steam as a sweep gas for the 
MR system. However, it is worth noting that the investment cost 
and the cost of electricity in the membrane-based system are 4% 
and 1.4% lower than the reference case, respectively [218] . Rezvani 
et al. found that the overall eﬃciency of IGCC with CO 
2  capture 
using a Pd-Ag  membrane is  3.7% higher than using Selexol,  and 
the investment cost of the membrane system is 1.6% lower than 
the Selexol system. The results of these techno-economic studies 
are subject to assumptions on separation eﬃciencies, capital and 
operating costs, and even regulations on CO 
2  capture, and there- 
fore should be interpreted and compared with caution. Lab- and 
pilot-scale experimental studies will be needed to fully understand 
the potential opportunities and issues of applying Pd-based mem- 
branes in electricity generation with pre-combustion carbon cap- 
ture. 

In  addition  to  electricity,  hydrogen  can  be  co-produced  from 
coal- or natural gas–based processes. For instance, PSA can be in- 
tegrated with the shift reactor for bulk hydrogen recovery in the 
range of 70-85% and for high-purity hydrogen production [ 70 , 219 ], 
and this concept would be similar to the large-scale hydrogen pro- 
duction method conventionally employed. Techno-economic stud- 
ies have shown that, similar to the case of electricity generation 
from  an  IGCC  plant,  Pd-based  membranes  may  only  offer  mod- 
est eﬃciency improvements and cost savings compared to PSA or 
physical absorption. For example, Kreutz et al. assessed hydrogen 
production from coal gasiﬁcation with Pd 
40  membranes and 
2  capture and subsequent PSA for 
found that using Selexol for CO 
hydrogen puriﬁcation that the former case offers a less than 1% 
reduction in capital costs, but that the hydrogen production cost is 
2% greater [220] . 

60 Cu 

In theory, these metallic membranes for hydrogen production 
have  a  place  within  large-scale  systems.  However,  experimental 
testing has yet to reinforce these claims. Until large-scale testing 
occurs, hydrogen production membranes will remain experimental 
in scale. 

4.3. Hydrogen transportation and carbon dioxide capture via 
membrane technology 

In the transportation sector, hydrogen can be used as a fuel for 
either adapted hydrogen ICEsor onboard HFCVs. Even when hydro- 
gen is produced from SMR without CCUS, up to a 40% reduction in 
GHG emissions can be achieved in transportation due to the higher 
eﬃciency of a HFCV over a conventional gasoline-powered ICE ve- 
hicle [24] . Although the initial attention on HFCVs has shifted to 
other low-carbon transportation solutions such as biofuel and elec- 
tric cars [221] , steady research, design, and development (RD&D) 
progress has been made by leading international car and energy 
companies [222] . One of the remaining challenges is a lack of hy- 
drogen  fuel  infrastructure  [222] .  In  the  meantime,  on-site  natu- 
ral gas reforming at refueling stations could be a viable near- to 
medium-term solution [ 100 , 204 ], especially when low-cost natu- 
ral gas is available [100] . Additionally, Pd-based MRs may be con- 
sidered for distributed hydrogen production for application to the 
transportation sector. For instance, MRs can be used to produce hy- 
drogen on a small scale (between 2-4 MW) at the refueling sta- 
tions integrated with the existing natural gas infrastructure [204] . 
Another option would be onboard hydrogen production for fuel 
cells. For this application, high-purity hydrogen has to be produced 
within highly space-compact devices, and traditional puriﬁcation 
facilities would not be able to meet this requirement due to their 

complexity  and  size  [223] .  In  this  case,  MRs  would  be  advanta- 
geous for onboard applications given their ability to produce high- 
purity hydrogen within a small volume. In particular, the MR con- 
cept may potentially reduce the reactor volume by a factor of 10 
to 100 compared to conventional SMR and the subsequent WGS 
reaction [224] . Another beneﬁt of the MR is its high conversion ef- 
ﬁciencies. 

2 . The CO 

This onboard technology for transportation would have an MR 
on the vehicle, which would produce hydrogen for power (fuel cell 
or ICE) and temporarily store CO 
2 sourced from the high- 
pressure  side  of  the  membrane  would  be  stored  outside  of  the 
membrane unit, and the compression energy would be provided 
by the original fuel source, i.e., compressed natural gas. Upon re- 
fueling, the temporarily stored CO 
2  would be removed from the 
vehicle and subsequently used in a secondary market. In the case 
2 capture, the trade-off
of small-scale hydrogen production with CO 
between H 
2 transport to centralized 
facilities for usage should be balanced. 

2 distribution to users and CO 

In 2004, the U.S. DOE investigated funding future research re- 
lated to onboard fuel reforming and made a no-go decision. The 
investigation team believed the milestones could be met, but that 
the milestones could not be met in the timeframe allotted by the 
administration at that time. The original timeframe of 2030 was 
pushed up to 2015, thereby overpromising the potential onboard 
reforming technology at that time. Although the independent panel 
recommended a no-go decision, they also made a number of spe- 
ciﬁc recommendations that, if implemented, would effectively con- 
tinue support of onboard fuel processing RD&D [225] . 

5. Challenges for Pd membrane applications 

5.1. Structural and chemicalstability of Pd 

As mentioned brieﬂy in section 3 , one of the major challenges 
associated  with  the  mechanical  stability  of  pure  Pd  membranes 
arises from hydrogen embrittlement. The absorption of hydrogen 
into the Pd structure can induce the α-to- β phase transition at rel- 
atively low temperatures [16] . Palladium hydride (Pd-H) can exist 
as two distinct phases, α and β. The α phase is a solid solution 
while within the β phase, the H atoms are ordered within octahe- 
dral interstitial sites [109] . The distinct feature of the Pd-H phase 
diagram is that there is a miscibility gap where α and β phases 
coexist. The highest temperature beyond which the β phase can- 
not form is referred to as the “critical point”. The critical point is 
estimated to be approximately 298 °C and 2 MPa [ 129 , 226 ]. The 
existence of α and β phases depend on the atomic ratio of Pd to 
H. The α phase appears at concentrations of atomic hydrogen be- 
0.02 , while only the β phase exists at H concentrations 
low Pd-H 
higher than Pd-H 
0.02-0.58 both 
phases coexist [131] . The X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) results re- 
veal that, at room temperature, both the α and β phases of Pd-H 
alloys are FCC solid solutions and have lattice parameters greater 
than those of pure Pd [227] . The nucleation of β-hydride from the 
α phase will cause severe lattice strains which lead to membrane 
embrittlement  after  numerous  α–β phase  transitions  [192] .  The 
coexistence of two phases may lead to signiﬁcant volume expan- 
sion and hence membrane failure. Therefore, it is crucial to operate 
the MR at temperatures above the critical temperature [226] . 

0.58 . At H concentrations within Pd-H 

The  effect  of  hydrogen  embrittlement  on  the  integrity  of  the 
membrane  has  been  studied  extensively  [ 180 , 181 , 228 , 229 ].  Em- 
brittlement is simply deﬁned as the weakening of the membrane 
metal structure due to the diffusion and permeation of H atoms in 
the lattice structure [109] . Kolachev has listed eight main mecha- 
nisms responsible for the embrittlement-induced failure of metal- 
lic membranes which can be categorized by two types [229] . Em- 
brittlement  of  the  ﬁrst  type  is  caused  by  the  sources  that  are 

S. Liguori, K. Kian and N. Buggy et al. / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 80 (2020) 100851 

15 

initially present in the metal structure and before application of 
stresses. This type of embrittlement becomes more pronounced as 
the strain rate in the metal structure increases and is irreversible in 
nature. The embrittlement of the second type is caused by sources 
in the metal structure that only appear as the hydrogen concen- 
tration increases during the plastic deformation. Plastic deforma- 
tion is deﬁned as the “permanent distortion that occurs when a 
material is subjected to tensile, compressive, bending, or torsion 
stresses  that  exceed  its  yield  strength  and  cause  it  to  elongate, 
compress, buckle, bend, or twist”. [230] 

The embrittlement of the ﬁrst type may be caused by the: 

• Formation of gaseous reaction products between the hydrogen 

atoms and impurities in the metal structure 

• The formation and accumulation of molecular hydrogen in the 
discontinuities of the metal structures such as micro-shrinkage 
cavities or gas holes 

• Formation of hydride precipitates 
• Formation of dissolved hydrogen 

The embrittlement of the second type can be caused by the: 

• Decomposition  of  unstable  solid  solutions  inﬂuenced  by 

stresses 

• Interaction of H atoms with moving dislocations 
• Directional  diffusion  of  H  atoms  due  to  nonuniform  external 

elastic, thermal, and electric ﬁelds 

Although  the  development  of  an  embrittlement-resistant  Pd- 
based MR is a challenge, this phenomenon and its adverse effects 
may be diminished by careful and accurate modeling and predic- 
tion of the temperature proﬁle inside an MR, cautious selection of 
operating  conditions,  avoiding  to  apply  pressure  pulses,  and  op- 
timizing membrane-support interactions [ 109 , 231 ]. Moreover, the 
embrittlement phenomena can be reduced or avoided by alloying 
pure Pd with different metals, as reported in section 3. 

5.2. The effect of poisoning on the performance of Pd-based MRs 

The surface of a Pd membrane is susceptible to contamination 
by chemical components in the gas stream, such as sulfur and car- 
bon impurities. Hydrogen sulﬁde, at concentrations as low as 5-10 
ppm, readily adsorbs onto the Pd surface leading to the formation 
of a strong metal-sulfur bond and, as a result, hydrogen dissocia- 
tion may be substantially inhibited due to the lack of active sites 
available on the surface [ 139 , 232 , 233 ]. This surface inhibition may 
be the dominant mechanism of sulfur poisoning, but severe sulfur 
exposure may lead to bulk sulﬁde formation causing irreversible 
damage to the membrane [234] . This could be a signiﬁcant draw- 
back in the case of utilizing the syngas from coal gasiﬁcation or 
natural  gas  reforming,  which  commonly  contains  concentrations 
2 S [ 235 , 236 ]. In order 
from hundreds of ppm to several percent H 
to reduce the sulfur content suitable for Pd-based membrane op- 
eration, pre-desulfurization may be required. Sulfur-resistant alloy 
membrane materials may also alleviate the impact of sulfur, as dis- 
cussed previously in section 3.2 . In addition to the sulfur poison- 
ing, the formation and deposition of carbon in high-temperature 
catalytic applications such as methane reforming or dehydrogena- 
tion may lead to defects thereby shortening the membrane lifetime 
[ 31 , 207 ]. 

Other compounds have also been reported that could lead to 
the poisoning of the Pd-based membrane and MRs and hindering 
of the hydrogen permeation. Carbon monoxide, steam, hydrocar- 
bons, chlorine and mercury are the compounds/elements reported 
in the literature which may decrease the hydrogen permeating ﬂux 
in a Pd-based MR. CO may compromise the permeating ﬂux of hy- 
drogen via two different mechanisms depending on the operating 

temperatures. At lower temperatures, the main mechanism for re- 
ducing hydrogen ﬂux is the adsorption of CO molecules onto the 
Pd surface where they compete with hydrogen atoms for the active 
sites [ 121 , 237 ]. At higher temperatures the catalytic decomposition 
of CO molecules and carbon deposition on the Pd surface is the 
main  mechanism  for  hampering  the  hydrogen  permeation  [237] . 
Some studies suggest that electronegative atoms such as chlorine 
and oxygen may act a as “poison” for the adsorption of the elec- 
tropositive molecules such as hydrogen by “electronically” blocking 
the surrounding area next to the hydrogen molecules and prevent- 
ing them from getting access to the active sites [238] . Water vapor 
molecules can also poison the Pd surface and hinder the permeat- 
ing ﬂux of hydrogen, however, compared with CO molecules, water 
vapor has a more adverse effect [ 121 , 233 ]. At low temperatures the 
adsorption of water on the metal surface occurs due to physisorp- 
tion of water dipoles on the Pd surface. At higher temperatures, 
however, dissociative chemisorption of water vapor molecules on 
the solid surface is the governing mechanism controlling the ad- 
sorption. Although the number of adsorbed water molecules de- 
creases  with  increasing  the  temperature,  the  decomposition  rate 
of the adsorbed molecules increases at elevated temperatures. This 
means that the dissociation of water molecules into hydrogen and 
oxygen atoms and the recombination of these atoms to reform the 
water molecules could potentially poison the Pd surface with the 
adsorbed oxygen atoms as explained by Heras et al. [239] 

5.3. Pd availability 

Although Pd-based membranes may be promising alternatives 
to  PSA  and  cryogenic  distillation  for  H 
2  separation  on  small  to 
medium scales, their success for large industrial scales is still un- 
certain due to the availability of Pd. Palladium is a precious metal 
that  is  ﬁnite  and  should  be  used  sparingly  in  application.  The 
global supply of Pd in 2012 was 186 tonnes, which still fell short 
of the demand in the same year of 242 tonnes [240] . 

Primarily, Pd is used as a catalyst for automobile emission con- 
trols,  electrical  and  electronic  equipment,  dental  prostheses,  and 
jewelry. In 2014, approximately 65% of the global Pd was used in 
the automobile industry and 14% in the electrical and electronic 
equipment sector [ 241 , 242 ]. The global Pd production in 2017 was 
around 225 tones. Only ﬁve countries account for more than 95% 
of the global Pd production, i.e., South Africa, Russia, U.S., Canada, 
and Zimbabwe [243] . 

The 2019 U.S. Geological Survey mineral commodity summaries 
report estimates that the total global resources of the platinum- 
group metals (PGMs) are more than 10 0,0 0 0 tonnes. In particular, 
more than 75% of all produced Pd comes from two countries, i.e., 
Russia (38%) and South Africa (39%) [244] . 

The  availability  of  Pd  with  regard  to  large-scale  applications 
such as IGCC power plants has been discussed in detail by Helmi 
et al. [240] . A key conclusion from their study is that given the 
scale of membrane material requirements predicted from modeling 
studies, even a rather optimistic assumption of membrane thick- 
ness  would  result  in  1.2  to  9  tonnes  of  palladium  for  a  single 
power plant with the electricity production capacity of 1.0 GWe. 
For example, Galuszka estimated that 1.2 tonnes of Pd would be 
required to supply hydrogen to a 1,0 0 0 ton/day methanol synthe- 
sis plant from methane reforming using a 10- μm Pd coating on an 
Al 
3  cat- 
alyst  [31] .  Helmi  and  coworkers  estimated  that  approximately  2 
tonnes of Pd would be needed for a 386-MW IGCC plant, given 
a thickness of 10 μm [240] . Membrane thickness, permeance, and 
composition, all affect estimated Pd requirements but do not im- 
pact the amount required beyond an order of magnitude [240] .

To alleviate the concern of diminishing world Pd resources and 
provide a conﬁdent source well into the future [245] , Pd may be

recycled from a spent MR, similar to the automotive industry’s re- 
cycling of metals from catalytic converters [246] . The average recy- 
cling rate of PGMs in chemical and petrochemical industries is 76%, 
and a feasible Pd recovery of 60% may be plausible with negligible 
cost [204] . 

5.4. Technical challenges and uncertainties for Pd membrane scale-up 

In addition to material availability, scale-up potential on the or- 
der of 1.5 million m 3 /day may be another limiting factor prevent- 
ing wider application of Pd-based membranes. Process-scale anal- 
ysis from the literature has reported that Pd-based metallic mem- 
branes  may  not  satisfy  the  production  rate  on  a  large  scale  for 
economic industrial hydrogen production while meeting the purity 
criteria [213] . Despite the promising progress observed in emerg- 
ing small-scale membrane units [66] , it remains unclear whether 
thin, defect-free, and stable Pd-based membranes can be econom- 
ically mass-produced; therefore, much RD&D is still needed in this 
area [ 31 , 70 , 204 , 207 , 215 ]. 

Reducing the membrane thickness is a key factor in making Pd- 
based membranes cost-effective [ 15 , 204 , 207 ]. For example, it has 
been  predicted  that  a  membrane  thickness  below  20  μm  could 
make  Pd-based  MRs  competitive  with  traditional  WGS  reactors 
[15] , yet today commercially-available membranes are 20-50 μm 
thick, and thinner membranes of 2-5 μm are only produced on 
the laboratory scale [204] . In order to support a thin metal layer, 
a high-quality porous substrate (e.g., a small pore size with a nar- 
row pore size distribution) is required. In fact, this substrate be- 
comes 50 times more expensive than the cost of the thin layer of 
Pd [247] . Therefore, for the composite membranes to be econom- 
ically viable on an industrial scale, not only does the cost of the 
thin metallic layer need to be reduced but also that of the porous 
support [192] . 

Enhanced  permeability  and  reduced  material  cost  may  be 
achieved  through  investigation  of  new  materials  such  as  alloys, 
Earth-abundant metals, or amorphous metals, as discussed in sec- 
tion  3.  Using  new  membrane  materials  or  substrates  combined 
with  suitable  fabrication  methods  could  also  alleviate  instability 
against chemical impurities and thermal impacts. The high cost of 
Pd may be avoided by using Earth-abundant Group 5 metals, which 
cost approximately 1,0 0 0 times less than Pd at approximately $15 
per kg, compared with that of Pd which is more than $49,0 0 0 per 
kg. 

In  addition  to  improved  performance  and  lower  costs,  long- 
term stability and durability against aggressive chemical environ- 
ments,  high-pressure  conditions,  and  thermal  cycling  are  critical 
to scale-up and remain to be demonstrated for commercialization 
purposes [ 207 , 215 ]. The integration of catalysts into the membrane 
unit would add another layer of vulnerability-depending on how 
the  catalyst  is  embedded,  complete  replacement  of  the  module 
may be necessary if the catalyst fails [248] . It is therefore necessary 
to develop the ability to repair the membrane during operation for 
commercial application [31] , which is currently done for commer- 
cial polymeric membranes [ 31 , 207 ]. Other scale-up challenges that 
need  to  be  addressed  include  diﬃculties  in  sealing  [ 31 , 207 , 249 ], 
lack of pilot-scale performance data [249] , and the need for ma- 
terial and design optimization to balance the reaction productivity 
and membrane ﬂux [31] . 

5.5. Cost of Pd membrane scale-up 

Relevant  to  both  the  scale  and  material  availability  are  eco- 
nomic  considerations.  Membranes  are  limited  when  it  comes  to 
economies  of  scale  [ 31 , 248 ]  and  consequently  have  minor  ben- 
eﬁts  of  scale-up  due  to  their  modular  nature  [204] .  The  capi- 
tal  cost  of  membrane  systems  scales  less  than  linearly  with  in- 

creasing  plant  size  [250] .  Assuming  that  Pd  membranes  have  a 
module cost of $1,500/ft 2 ($16,146/m 2 ) [106], based on the mem- 
brane  surface  area  estimates  by  Chiesa  and  coworkers  (~34,0 0 0 
m 2 ) [215], a capital investment of $548 million would be needed 
for the membrane unit at a 420-MW IGCC plant. By comparison, 
the total capital investment for post-combustion amine absorption 
units in natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) plants has been esti- 
mated to be $0.7-1.0 million/MW [251–253] x , and that for phys- 
ical  absorption  units  (Selexol)  for  IGCC  plants  $1.2  (2007)  -  2.9 
(2006) million/MW [ 252 , 254–256 ]. xi Whether it is justiﬁed to in- 
vest in metallic membrane–based carbon capture will depend on 
the trade-off between cost and required performance [31] and the 
2 emissions. Some 
adoption of a national policy framework on CO 
authors have suggested that the cost of Pd membranes and their 
production will decrease as cumulative production increases [257] . 
For example, Iaquaniello and coworkers forecast that the cost of 
Pd-based membranes will be reduced from ca . $112,432/m 2 xii at a 
cumulative production of 1,0 0 0 m 2 to ca . $1,253/m 2 when cumula- 
tive production reaches 10,0 0 0,0 0 0 m 2 worldwide [257] . However, 
if one assumes a membrane thickness of 10 μm, 10,0 0 0,0 0 0 m 2 of 
production would equate to 1,200 tonnes of Pd, which is more than 
ﬁve times the global mine production of palladium in 2018 [258] . 
Given the already unstable Pd market [ 31 , 240 ], the effect of this 
large production on the price of Pd as well as whether the con- 
cept of economies associated with “learning by doing” would hold 
in this case remains uncertain. 

6. Technoeconomic Analysis 

Hydrogen  producing  facilities  may  be  categorized  into  three 
different  groups  based  on  their  hydrogen  production  capacities: 
small-scale or  distributed  (i.e.,  10 0-1,50 0  kg  H 
2  per  day  at  fuel- 
ing stations), medium-scale or semi-central (i.e., 1,50 0-50,0 0 0 kg 
2 per day on the outskirts of cities), large-scale or central (i.e., > 
H 
50,0 0 0 kg of H 
2 per day) [259] . Conventional SMR technology is a 
well-developed technology and, currently, the energy yield of hy- 
drogen production is estimated at 60 gH 
2 /kWh. This value is equiv- 
alent to a cost of $1.72 xiii per kg of H 
2 . The ﬁnished cost of pro- 
ducing one kg of hydrogen may vary signiﬁcantly depending on the 
geographical location and the method of generating electricity. This 
2 /kWh is the target 
energy yield of hydrogen production of 60 gH 
value set by the U.S. DOE as the benchmark for other competitive 
technologies by 2020 [259] . Although the 2020 target cost to pro- 
duce one kg H 
2 for various technologies varies from $2.30 to $9.20, 
the ultimate target cost for all technologies is set at $1.0 0-2.0 0 per 
kg of H 

2 . 

Depending  on  the  type  of  electrolyte  used  for  the  electroly- 
sis  processes,  the  electrolyzers  can  be  divided  into  three  main 
categories, i.e., proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer, al- 
kaline electrolyzer, and solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC). PEMs 
usually require noble catalysts which in turn increases the capi- 
tal costs required for manufacturing such electrolyzers. However, 
the solid polymer electrolyte used in these electrolyzers provides 
them with signiﬁcant advantages which makes these electrolyzers 
unique.  Compact  and  leak-free  design,  high  current  density,  low 
gas  crossover  rate,  and  capacity  to  operate  at  pressures  as  high 
as 350 bar are among the advantages of PEMs. This last feature,

makes it possible to produce hydrogen at signiﬁcantly higher pres- 
sure thereby eliminating the need for compressors before deliver- 
ing the hydrogen to the consumer. PEMs usually operate at inter- 
mediate voltages (1.7-2.0V) and high current densities (more than 
1.0 A.cm −2 ) which lead to higher nominal eﬃciencies [260] . 

The alkaline electrolyzer is the most mature and the most com- 
mon type of electrolyzer which has the lowest capital cost amongst 
all electrolyzer types. Despite their low capital cost, alkaline elec- 
trolyzers  are  prone  to  leaking,  and  have  lower  current  density 
both of which stem from the fact that unlike PEMs, alkaline elec- 
trolyzers  use  aqueous  electrolytes.  Alkaline  electrolyzers  usually 
operate at high voltages (1.8-2.4V) and low current densities (0.2- 
0.3A/cm 2 ) which will result in lower system eﬃciencies [260] . 

SOECs  are  newer  technology  compared  to  PEMs  and  alkaline 
electrolyzers.  SOECs  usually  operate  at  very  high  temperatures 
(900-950 °C) which translates into higher capital costs due to the 
need for more expensive materials such as ceramics in the man- 
ufacturing  of  the  SOEC  cells.  Furthermore,  a  heat  source  is  re- 
quired  to  provide  the  thermal  energy  for  SOECs.  Unlike  alkaline 
electrolyzers, SOECs do not suffer from leakage and have a more 
compact  design.  The  single  greatest  drawback  of  SOECs  is  their 
long-term degradation which is actively being investigated by sci- 
entists. SOECs operate at very low voltages (i.e., less than 1.4V) and 
moderate current densities (0.4-0.8A/cm 2 ) which allows them to 
have considerably higher electrical eﬃciency. Signiﬁcant research 
is currently being conducted on the SOEC-based power-to-methane 
(P2M) systems to increase their technological readiness level (TRL) 
from TRL5 to TRL6 [261] . 

It is worth noting that the “thermodynamic limit” of the energy 
2 /kWh while for water electrol- 
yield for SMR may be up to 105 gH 
2 /kWh xiv at 25 °C and ambient pressure. It 
ysis the limit is 25.4 gH 
should be noted that the current commercial electrolyzer systems 
have signiﬁcantly high eﬃciencies (approximately 50 kWh/kgH 
2 ) 
which are very close to the theoretical minimum energy. Never- 
theless,  when  coupled  with  renewable  energy  resources  such  as 
PV cells, the overall eﬃciency of the system declines signiﬁcantly 
(i.e., eﬃciencies as low as 20% for PV-SOEC  are common) stem- 
ming from the very low eﬃciency of the PV cells (i.e., less than 
17%) [260]. Hence, eﬃciency improvements based on novel tech- 
nological breakthroughs are very limited for these systems [262] . 
High temperature electrolysis systems, however, have the potential 
to improve this limit and lower the cost only if the electrolyzer 
system  is  located  in  the  proximity  of  a  low-cost  or  waste  heat 
source. Therefore, the key to success of the electrolyzer systems 
relies on the optimization of other key parameters such as capital 
cost or lifetime rather than focusing on electrical eﬃciency. As a 
result, small commercial electrolyzer systems in remote areas, due 
to their low capital requirements, can be very competitive against 
the conventional hydrogen plants. 

Fuel cost is the single largest cost component in production of 
hydrogen by natural gas reforming, accounting between 45-75% of 
the production cost of hydrogen. Nevertheless, low prices of natu- 
ral gas in some geographical regions such as the Middle East and 
Russia (due to the existence of enormous conventional natural gas 
resources) and the U.S. (due to the existence of immense uncon- 
ventional gas resources such as shale gas reserves and the avail- 
ability of advanced technologies such as hydraulic fracturing and 
horizontal  drilling),  have  made  the  production  cost  of  hydrogen 
very inexpensive in these regions. 

Depending on the region, retroﬁtting of a CCUS unit to the SMR 
plant could increase the capital expenditure (CAPEX), and cost of 
fuel by 50% and 10%, respectively. The operating expenses could

at 25 °C and atmospheric pressure is approximately 39.4 kWh (based on the higher 
heating value of hydrogen). 

be doubled on average, due to the costs associated with CO 
2 cap- 
ture, handling, compression, transport and storage. However, there 
are some promising regions where the cost of producing hydrogen 
from a SMR with CCUS unit could be as low as $1.40 per kg of 
hydrogen produced. 

Despite  technological  advancements  in  the  development  of 
membranes and MRs, their numerous physical and technological 
features  such  as  lifetime  have  not  been  realized  with  great  cer- 
tainty [263] . One of the reasons that there is not a general con- 
sensus on the lifetime of membranes is the lack of unanimity of 
the term “long-term test”. In the open literature the experiments 
ranging from 80-8,640 hours have been considered as “long-term 
tests” [ 138 , 263–265 ].  The  movement  of  the  Pd  crystallites/atoms 
increases  at  high  temperature  and  for  prolonged  time  periods 
which  increases  the  possibility  of  pinhole  formation  and  subse- 
quent  membrane  failure  [266] .  This  effect  is  exacerbated  as  the 
thickness of the Pd layer decreases. Therefore, the thickness of the 
Pd layer can be increased to avoid the formation of pinholes. How- 
ever, as shown previously in equation (4) , the hydrogen permeat- 
ing ﬂux has an inverse relationship with the thickness of the Pd 
layer and by increasing the membrane thickness the hydrogen ﬂux 
would decrease, which is not economically attractive [267] . Hence, 
one of the most important elements in the design of an MR is the 
selection of an optimized thickness for the Pd layer which will be 
a compromise between the lifetime and hydrogen permeating ﬂux. 
The lifetime of the Pd-based membrane is usually assumed to be 
5 years [263] . This means that at least four replacements are re- 
quired for a plant with a lifetime of 25 years [268] . One of the ma- 
jor challenges for accurate economic evaluation for the Pd-based 
MR technology is the lack of large-scale commercial experience in 
this area. As a result, the majority of the economic studies reported 
in the literature are based on theoretical estimates. These studies 
adopt economic concepts such as net present value (NPV), ﬁxed 
capital investment (FCI) total capital investment (TCI), and internal 
rate of return (IRR), to give a reliable ﬁscal understanding of the 
Pd-based MR technology [ 263 , 267 , 269–271 ]. The sources of uncer- 
tainties that have been integrated into these studies will result in 
single-point value approximations rather than statistical economic 
evaluations, which leads to inaccurate valuation assessments and 
improper economic decisions. These studies mainly suffer from the 
principle of “ﬂaw of averages” [ 263 , 267 , 269–272 ]. 

In  order  to  overcome  the  ﬂaw  of  averages,  Castro  et  al. 
[263] used Monte Carlo simulation methods to study the effects of 
lifetime and membrane thickness on the economic performance of 
multiple Pd and Pd/Au membranes. Uncertainties such as sources 
of commodity market, and uncertainties associated with regulatory 
and ﬁnancing make the integration of Monte Carlo simulations in 
economic assessments inevitable. In this study it is showed that 
the lifetime of a pure Pd membrane is inferior to that of the Pd/Au 
membrane as the gold particles act as a paste that ﬁlls and covers 
the pinholes and defects induced in the surface of the membrane 
during the permeation tests [273] . Furthermore, the purity of pro- 
duced hydrogen decreases with time. More interestingly, this de- 
crease in quality is more pronounced in membranes with thinner 
Pd layers. However, thicker membranes will increase the capital in- 
vestment signiﬁcantly. For instance, increasing the Pd layer thick- 
ness from 2.7 μm to 4.6 μm and 10.4 μm will increase the mem- 
brane lifetime by 16% and 152%, respectively. The TCI also increases 
as the thickness of the Pd layer increases from 2.7 μm to 4.6 μm 
and 10.4 μm due to additional amounts of Pd used in membrane 
fabrication. This study reveals that the thinnest membrane has the 
best economic performance in terms of lowest FCI, TCI, and lev- 
elized cost of hydrogen (LCOH). 

Collodi  et.  al  performed  a  comprehensive  study  on  the  eco- 
nomic performance of various SMR plants. Their work compares 
and contrasts the performance and various cost indices of a SMR

plants with and without CCUS units producing 10 0,0 0 0 Nm 3 /h H 
2 
operating as a merchant plant [274] . This study evaluates ﬁve dif- 
2 from a SMR plant and 
ferent alternative scenarios to capture CO 
compares them with a modern SMR plant which is equipped with 
feedstock pretreatment, pre-reforming, HTS, and PSA units. These 
alternative  technologies  can  capture  CO 
2  from  the  shifted  syn- 
gas, PSA tail gas or SMR ﬂue gas using monoethanolamine (MEA), 
methyldiethanolamine (MDEA), or cryogenic and membrane sepa- 
ration. In this work, the discounted cash ﬂow analysis and LCOH 
are  used  to  compare  various  technologies.  Furthermore,  the  CO 
2 
avoidance cost (CAC) is another key index which is used to com- 
pare the overall performance of these plants. The CAC maybe cal- 
culated as: 

CAC = 

LCO H C C S − L CO H 

Re f erence 
Re f erence − C O 2 Emission s C C S

According to this study, in solvent-based CO 

2 capture scenarios, 
the overall consumption of natural gas has increased by more than 
200% only to regenerate the solvent. The electricity that is required 
2 capture, will result in high energy penalties in these cases. 
for CO 
In a plant where CO 
2 is captured from the PSA tail gas using low 
2  separation and membrane technology, the con- 
temperature CO 
sumption of natural gas is reduced by approximately 7% compared 
to the base case. Moreover, in order to capture 90% of the CO 
2 from 
the SMR plant, the capital cost will increase by 78% compared with 
the base case. Furthermore, depending on the overall CO 
2 capture 
rate,  from  53%  to  90%,  the  LCOH  may  increase  by  0.02  to  0.06 
$/Nm 3 , respectively. The CO 
2 avoided cost is estimated to vary be- 
tween $51.12 and $77.24 per tonne xv . The LCOH will increase be- 
tween 18-45% depending on the CCUS technology implemented at 
the plant. Other similar studies show that CO 
2 capture (80-85% cap- 
ture from the concentrated PSA stream) will add approximately 25- 
30% to the cost of produced hydrogen by the SMR process [13] . 
The cost of hydrogen production may be reduced if a positive cash 
ﬂow is generated by selling the captured CO 
2  for direct usage. It 
should be noted that, cost of hydrogen produced by SMR is very 
sensitive to the price of natural gas, its quality and heating value 
[275] . Furthermore, the capacity and eﬃciency of hydrogen plants 
must be considered when calculating the LCOH as the economy of 
scale plays a crucial role in the industrial processes. For instance, 
two hydrogen production plants could be identical in all aspects 
except for their capacities and this can have a signiﬁcant effect on 
the LCOH of the plants. 

These  results  indicate  that  the  production  of  hydrogen  with 
CCUS units (either solvent-based or membrane-based) will add sig- 
niﬁcantly  to  the  LCOH,  consumes  a  compelling  amount  of  elec- 
tricity, which would otherwise be exported to the grid. Therefore, 
it is crucial for any hydrogen producing facility to consider these 
economic implications before making a decision about retroﬁtting 
their plants with CCUS units. 

Hydrogen  may  also  be  produced  by  water  electrolysis  where 
water is dissociated into hydrogen and oxygen molecules. Water 
electrolysis for hydrogen production is accomplished according the 
following half reactions:

such that F is the Faraday constant measuring 1.0 mole of electric- 
ity (96,485 °C/mol). According to equation (13) , the overall cost of 
water electrolysis is mandated by the price of acquiring water and 
the cost of electricity. Cost of acquiring water can be reduced to 
negligible amounts by developing the electrolysis plant in appro- 
priate geographical locations where water is abundant and cheap. 
In order to improve the conductivity and enhance the overall yield 
of  hydrogen,  an  electrolyte,  usually  caustic  potash  (KOH),  is  dis- 
solved in water. Despite the advantages of water electrolysis, such 
2 emissions xvi associated with the electrolysis 
as potentially low CO 
process, there are still challenges that need to be addressed: the 
amount of electricity consumed in commercial alkaline electroly- 
sis systems for the production of pure hydrogen is very high (ap- 
proximately 4.5-5 kWh/m n 3 H 
2 ) [277] , the cathode and anode elec- 
trodes are coated with platinum and manganese oxide respectively 
[275] ,which makes the process economically unattractive. Further- 
more, compression of the produced hydrogen to pressures as high 
as 880 bar will add further costs [98] . According to recent studies 
performed  by  National  Academies  of  Sciences  and  the  U.S.  DOE, 
the  current  delivered  cost  of  one  kg  of  hydrogen  generated  by 
grid-power electrolysis, wind-power electrolysis, and solar-power 
electrolysis are approximately $6-7, $7-11, and $10-30 respectively. 
These numbers may be reduced to as low as $3-4 per kg of hy- 
drogen delivered with advancements in the wind turbine and solar 
panel technologies and with the introduction of “smart grid” in the 
future [278] . 

As  reported,  the  major  challenges  associate  with  water  elec- 
trolysis technologies are the signiﬁcant amount of electricity and 
large volumes of water required for the process. Producing today’s 
global  hydrogen  demand  from  water  electrolysis  requires  more 
than 3,600 TWh of electricity which is more than the annual elec- 
tricity generation of the whole European Union. In addition, ap- 
proximately 9.0 kg of water is required to produce 1.0 kg of hydro- 
gen. Producing today’s global energy demand from water electroly- 
sis will require more than 617 million cubic meter of water which 
is equivalent to 1.3% of water consumed in the global energy sec- 
tor. Using fresh water for electrolysis could be an environmental 
and social challenge in areas that are already dealing with water 
crisis. Direct use of sea water, in coastal areas, would result in cor- 
rosive damage to the equipment. Use of desalinated water could 
be the only short-term solution to the water problem. However, it 
should be noted that it requires between 3.0-4.0 kWh of electricity 
to desalinate 1.0 m 3 of seawater through reverse osmosis process. 
As  mentioned  earlier,  the  three  main  electrolyzer  technolo- 
gies that exist today are alkaline electrolyzers, PEMs, and SOECs. 
Nonetheless, another hydrogen production technology that has re- 
ceived signiﬁcant attention in recent years is solar-driven electrol- 
ysis. Electrolysis fueled by solar energy can be divided into two 
major  categories:  photoelectrochemical  (PEC)  water  splitting  and 
photovoltaic electrolysis (PV-E). A PEC system is a fully integrated 
unit that absorbs sunlight and directly produces hydrogen while 
the PV-E system consists of independent photovoltaic modules that 
drive separate electrolyzer units and has more operational ﬂexibil- 
ity compared with the PEC system [279] . 

The  overall  chemical  reaction  for  water  electrolysis  can  be 
written  as  a  combination  of  the  two  half-reactions  as  fol-

It is worth noting that in 2018, 63.5% of the U.S. electricity was generated from 
fossil fuels. Approximately 35% of electricity was produced from natural gas while 
roughly 27% of electricity came from coal. Therefore, the source of electricity must 
be considered to calculate the accurate emission values. Furthermore, some might 
argue, if the electricity come from the renewable sources, it would be better to 
decarbonize the grid in the ﬁrst place rather than spending it for water electrolysis 
directly.

Cost of hydrogen produced by electrolysis depends on factors 
such as the cost of electricity, cost of water, conversion eﬃciency, 
CAPEX, and annual operating hours. CAPEX requirements for alka- 
line electrolysis, PEM electrolysis, and SOEC electrolysis could be 
in  the  ranges  of  $50 0-1,40 0/kW e ,  $1,10 0-1,80 0/kW e ,  and  $2,80 0- 
5,600/kW e , respectively. According to a recent study by Shaner et 
al., the LCOH and total CAPEX for a base-case PV-E system are esti- 
2 and $260 million, respectively. The LCOH 
mated at $12.1 per kg H 
and capital expenditure for the base-case PEC system is reported 
to be $11.4 per kg H 
2 and $205 million, respectively [279] . In or- 
der for a PV-E system to be competitive with the PEC system, an 
increase in eﬃciency or decrease in the capital expenditure is nec- 
essary. 

Solar-driven technologies are limited by low solar power den- 
sity (less than 1.0 kW/m 2 ), low capacity factor (less than 25%), and 
low conversion eﬃciencies (less than 20%). The cost of producing 
hydrogen (without compression, storage, and dispensing) by SMR 
2 , when the price of natural gas 
can be as low as $1.43 per kg of H 
feedstock is assumed to remain constant at $4 per MMBtu [280] . 
With the current prices of natural gas xvii , in order for PV-E tech- 
nologies to be at cost parity with SMR, a minimum carbon tax of 
$1,200 per tonne of CO 

2 would be required [279] . 
Considering  the  challenges  associated  with  the  development 
of electrolysis technology, along with the economic disadvantages 
compared with processes such as SMR, it is expected that the scale 
of hydrogen produced by electrolysis will not change in the near 
future and will be mainly limited to small-scale and unique ap- 
plications. An additional crucial aspect that one needs to keep in 
mind is the concept of “locked investment”. The average plant life- 
time is approximately 25-30 years and once a plant is built it is ex- 
pected to be operational for this timeframe. This may even further 
slow down the transition toward decarbonization in the absence 
of appropriate legal frameworks. The only scenario in which an in- 
crease in the volume of produced hydrogen by electrolysis is plau- 
sible, is when stringent national and international climate policies 
are put in place that help our global society to reduce our depen- 
dence on fossil fuels. Implementation of such policies would make 
the ﬁnished cost of produced hydrogen signiﬁcantly higher due to 
either carbon penalties associated with combustion of natural gas 
or the cost of CO 
2 capture and sequestration. Therefore, under such 
policies, water electrolysis could be a competitive alternative. 

Hydrogen can also be produced from biomass resources. How- 
ever, one of the major challenges with this approach is the large- 
scale availability of cheap biomass. For instance, in order to pro- 
duce the hydrogen demand in the U.S., roughly 100% of the na- 
tion’s  biomass  capacity  is  required  while  the  same  goal  can  be 
achieved  with  only  6%  of  the  country’s  wind  power  and  1%  of 
its  solar  power  potential.  Nevertheless,  combining  biomass  and 
CCUS for hydrogen production could be a potential “negative emis- 
sion” technology which will be more attractive in a scenario where 
climate change mitigation policies place higher penalties on CO 
2 
emissions. 

In  recent  years,  plasmas  have  gained  interest  for  application 
to hydrogen production from both gaseous and liquid fuels. One 
of  the  plasma-based  techniques  for  hydrogen  production  is  the 
plasma arc decomposition technology. This method simply decom- 
poses natural gas into carbon and hydrogen and is claimed to pro- 
duce no CO 

2 [281] as indicated in equation (14) : 

C H 4 → C + 2 H 2 

(14) 

In principle, plasma reforming reactions are the same as con- 
ventional reforming reactions with the exception that the required

energy and free radicals used for the reforming reaction are pro- 
vided  by  a  plasma  that  is  usually  generated  by  electric  or  ther- 
mal energy [282] . The plasma used for hydrogen production from 
gaseous fuels are generated by various methods such as electron 
beam, dielectric-barrier discharge, gliding arc, plasmatron arc, and 
microwave  discharge  [259] .  Plasma  reformers  can  generate  pure 
hydrogen  streams  from  an  array  of  hydrocarbon  fuels  (such  as 
gasoline, diesel, oil, natural gas, alcohols, etc.) with conversion ef- 
ﬁciencies very close to 100% [283] . Among all the plasma meth- 
ods, the plasma generated by a plasmatron arc and supported by a 
catalyst is the most advanced technology that is currently capable 
of producing hydrogen from methane with an energy yield (225 
2 /kWh) that meets the 2020 DOE target [259] . In addition, the 
gH 
recent developments in the microwave plasma sources (MPSs) with 
catalysts have shown very promising results and have achieved en- 
ergy yields as high as 62.8 gH 

2 /kWh [259] . 

One advantage of using plasma approaches for hydrogen pro- 
duction is its compactness due to the high energy density of the 
plasma  system  and  very  short  response  time.  Furthermore,  the 
heavy particles (such as atoms and molecules) can reach tempera- 
tures as high as 2,0 0 0-6,0 0 0 K while lighter particles (such as elec- 
trons) can reach temperatures up to 10,0 0 0 K in the plasma envi- 
ronment. In addition, plasma matter contains reactive radicals (i.e., 
H, OH, and O) and ions which signiﬁcantly enhance the conver- 
sion of hydrocarbon fuels into hydrogen in the high-temperature 
medium [259] . 

Although some plasma reforming methods such as MPS have 
numerous  advantages  over  the  conventional  reforming  processes 
such as better response time, the ability to produce hydrogen from 
heavier hydrocarbons, and hydrogen production from gaseous fu- 
els with an energy yield close to that set by DOE target, the high 
amount of electricity required in addition to high electrode erosion 
at  elevated  pressures  represent  signiﬁcant  challenges  [ 284 , 285 ]. 
Furthermore,  plasma  methods  face  other  challenges  such  as  low 
hydrogen  production  rates,  and  high  investment  and  operating 
costs [259] . 

Other than the methods discussed earlier, there are some other 
technologies that show signiﬁcant potential for hydrogen produc- 
tion and might play a role in future hydrogen economy scenarios. 
Among these methods are the chemical looping combustion (CLC) 
and the alcohol reforming processes that show promising capacity 
for future carbon-free scenarios [286] . 

In  the  recent  decades  a  compelling  amount  of  research  has 
been conducted in the area of hydrogen production via alcohol re- 
forming. One of the advantages of alcohol reforming over methane 
reforming is that unlike steam reforming of methane, in alcohol 
reforming,  the  hydrocarbon  source  is  in  liquid  state  which  may 
eliminate the need for gaseous hydrogen storage and distribution 
for  on-board  hydrogen  production  in  HFCVs  [287] .  Other  advan- 
tages  of  alcohol  reforming  over  steam  reforming  include  easier 
handling and transport, lower cost, and alternative modes of syn- 
thesis [ 288 , 289 ]. For instance, methanol and ethanol can be effort- 
lessly synthesized from both fossil fuels and biomass-based syn- 
gas. The latter method has a great potential to make alcohol re- 
forming an attractive alternative method for conventional SMR in a 
low carbon intensity economy. More speciﬁcally, in a process called 
bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), bioethanol can 
be produced from the fermentation of biomass, such as corn and 
sugarcane, while CO 
2 is captured permanently stored in geological 
formations. 

Steam alcohol reforming (SAR) can be carried out in an MR in 
an identical process to that of SMR as depicted in Figure 7 . Gallucci 
et al., have conducted numerous experimental studies on the SAR 
process which reveal that in an MR, methanol conversions could be 
as high as 100% while in the conventional reactor, the maximum 
methanol conversion is reported to be only 50% [289] .

Figure 7.  Schematic of an MR for SMR or SAR process (taken from Anzelmo et al.) [290] 

Many other studies investigated the effect of several parameters 
on  the  performance  of  SAR  in  MR  technology.  In  particular,  He- 
dayati et al. performed a rigorous exergy analysis for the ethanol 
steam  reforming  (ESR)  reaction  conducted  in  an  MR  [ 291 , 292 ]. 
Their exergy analyses revealed that the performance of the reform- 
ing system can be improved by eliminating/minimizing the irre- 
versibilities and losses in the system, and that the optimal operat- 
ing conditions which give the highest exergy eﬃciencies for the 
ESR  reaction  correspond  at  highest  possible  operating  pressures 
and temperatures and lowest possible steam to carbo (S/C) ratios. 
Nevertheless, further development in MRs performance and more 
stringent climate policies could make the SAR an attractive alter- 
native to the conventional SMR. 

Another technology that has gained signiﬁcant attention for hy- 
drogen production in the last two decades is the CLC process. Un- 
like a conventional combustion cycle system, a CLC process, em- 
ploys  two  ﬂuidized  bed  reactors,  an  air  reactor  (AR)  and  a  fuel 
reactor  (FR)  accompanied  with  a  circulating  metal  oxide  (M x O y ) 
which serves as an oxygen carrier for the combustion cycle. The 
metal  oxide  particles  are  reduced  in  the  FR  using  the  hydrocar- 
bon fuel as a reducer according to equation (15) . Next, the reduced 
particles are oxidized in the AR to regenerate the metal oxide as 
shown in equation (16) [286] . 

(2 n + m ) M x O y + C n H 2 m → (2 n + m ) M x O y −1 + m H 2 O + nC O 2

One of the biggest advantages of the CLC process is the sepa- 
ration of fuel from the air using two different reaction chambers. 
This CLC design will allow for using nearly pure oxygen without 
nitrogen which signiﬁcantly eliminates NO x  formation [293] and 
improves the thermal eﬃciency of the process [294] . In addition, 
2 which are not di- 
the only combustion products are H 
luted by hydrogen. This will allow for capturing nearly pure CO 
2 
by simply condensing out the water vapor. Some of the common 
challenges associated with CLC processes are the erosion of the re- 
former tubes due to high temperature, the need for PSA and WGS 
reactors  for  hydrogen  separation  and  puriﬁcation,  and  selection 
of  the  suitable  oxygen  carrier  with  favorable  reactive  properties 
and high resistance against carbon deposition. However, the ma- 
jor drawback of the CLC process is the high pressure required for 
air compression and very high temperatures (more than 1,0 0 0 °C) 
required to keep the conversion rates high in the FR. This can be 

directly translated into high operating costs associated with pro- 
duction of a unit mass of hydrogen. One way to address these chal- 
lenges is to combine the CLC system with the MR which is called 
the  membrane  assisted  chemical  looping  reforming  (MA-CLR)  as 
proposed by Spallina et al. [295] . Their study shows that the MA- 
CLR can produce between 12-20% more hydrogen compared with 
the conventional ﬁred tubular reforming (FTR) process while the 
cost of producing hydrogen drops by more than 30% xviii  [295] . A 
summary of hydrogen production technologies along with their ad- 
vantages and drawbacks is provided in Table 6. A comparison be- 
tween the production cost of hydrogen using different technologies 
is represented in Figure 8 . As it can be seen in this ﬁgure, natu- 
ral gas without CCUS is the least expensive method of producing 
hydrogen while water electrolysis with the grid electricity is the 
most expensive method for producing the same amount of hydro- 
gen. Furthermore, this plot shows that, except for coal, the great- 
est cost component is the fuel cost. Therefore, the future prices of 
hydrogen will be a strong function of fuel prices. It is also worth 
mentioning that the hydrogen production cost with electrolysis is 
2  price  while  coal  without  CCUS  has  the 
not  sensitive  to  the  CO 
2 prices. 
greatest sensitivity to CO 

However, it should be noted that when discussing water elec- 
trolysis  technologies,  it  is  crucial  to  include  the  source  of  elec- 
tricity when calculating CO 
2 emissions. If the electricity for water 
electrolysis is provided by renewable energies or is coming from 
2  intensity  of  the  pro- 
nuclear  power,  then  one  can  assume  CO 
cess as negligible. Otherwise, depending on the source of electric- 
ity (natural gas or coal) the water electrolysis could emit signif- 
2 . As it is shown in Figure 9 , approximately 
icant amounts of CO 
40  kg  of  CO 
2  is  emitted  for  every  kg  of  hydrogen  produced  via 
water electrolysis when the electricity is generated in a coal-ﬁred 
power  plant.  As  a  comparison,  the  CO 
2  emission  from  a  natu- 
ral  gas  steam  reforming  plant  without  CCUS  is  approximately  9 
kgCO 
2 . This means that for water electrolysis process to have 
the same amount of emission as a natural gas reforming without 
2 intensity of the produced electricity should be less 
CCUS, the CO 
than 185 (gCO 
2 /kWh). These differences arise from the fact that 
signiﬁcant amount of energy is lost during the conversion of fos- 
sil fuels to electricity. Therefore, if the CO 
2  intensity of the elec- 
tricity is not reduced to the above-mentioned limits, it would be 

2 /kgH

The average production cost of hydrogen by FTR and MA-CLR technologies is re- 
ported to be 0.28 €/Nm 3 
H 2 respectively in 2016 values. [295] These 
values  can  be  converted  to  2019  inﬂation  adjusted  values  of  $3.72/kgH 2  and 
$2.52/kgH2 respectively. The weighted average exchange rate in 2016 is assumed 
to be 1.106560 for EURUSD.

Energy yield varies signiﬁcantly depending on the plasma technology employed. Dielectric barrier discharge is less energy eﬃcient (as low as 0.5 gH 2 /kWh) while 

plasmatron with catalyst is more energy eﬃcient (as high as 225 gH 2 /kWh) 

more environmentally attractive to just burn the natural gas in a 
reforming reaction to produce hydrogen rather than converting it 
to electricity and later produce hydrogen via electrolysis. Hence, it 
is very clear that electrolysis for hydrogen production makes sense 
from a GHG emissions reduction perspective only if the electricity 
is generated from non-fossil fuel sources. 

7. Conclusions 

Advantages of hydrogen energy in terms of production, conver- 
sion, transportation, storage, along with its environmental benig- 
nity will make it a very promising solution to address both ever- 

increasing global energy needs and adverse climate change effects. 
However, it should be noted that replacing one energy source with 
another requires technology and infrastructure development. Tran- 
sition from one dominant fuel to another has taken 50 to 60 years 
historically. The world energy markets are currently observing the 
transition from oil to natural gas and this transition has occurred 
at the beginning years of the 21 st century with the advancement 
of technology in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing which 
made it possible to recover the previously inaccessible resources 
called “shale gas”. Therefore, despite the signiﬁcant growth of the 
renewable energies in the global energy portfolio, it is expected

nities) [296] 

that natural gas will remain a signiﬁcant component of the energy 
market in the foreseeable future. 

Fossil fuels have been the number one source for world hydro- 
gen production ( ca. 95%) with the current industrial process of SMR 
combined with PSA leading the hydrogen production market. The 
price of natural gas plays an important role in the future of hydro- 
gen production by SMR. The cost of hydrogen is largely dependent 
on the cost of natural gas, the required purity, and the logistics 
between production and point of use. Increasing prices of natural 
gas in the coming decades could potentially make coal gasiﬁcation 
with CCUS a better economic alternative unless environmental reg- 
ulations and policies prevent using coal or make its utilization very 
costly. 

Currently, the main industrial uses of hydrogen are ammonia 
synthesis  and  petroleum  reﬁning.  However,  it  is  expected  that 
novel economies such as HFCVs will be rapidly expanding as hy- 
drogen technology develops in the coming decades. While not able 
to meet the high production rates associated with the world’s hy- 
drogen demand, metallic membranes have potential in applications 
requiring high-purity hydrogen of 99.99 + % and small niche appli- 
cations, where membrane costs are less of a concern than perfor- 
mance, such as in fuel cells and semiconductor manufacturing. 

In a future carbon-constrained world, “clean” hydrogen produc- 
tion  should  take  place  with  the  implementation  of  CO 
2  capture 
units.  In  such  a  scenario,  using  metallic  membranes  for  hydro- 

gen production and puriﬁcation may become economically feasi- 
ble, provided that a carbon tax or other incentives are levied. Com- 
pact metallic MRs could be suitable for distributed and/or mobile 
hydrogen production and enable CO 
2 capture from these sources. 
Power  generation  from  IGCC  using  metallic  membranes  for  pre- 
combustion carbon capture may be competitive with other sepa- 
ration technologies (e.g., polymer membranes and physical absorp- 
tion) but the large-scale use of metallic membranes will remain 
a theoretical concept until it is proven by suﬃcient experimental 
studies under actual industrial conditions. 

Although Pd is a limited resource where the majority ( ca. 75%) 
of  mined  supply  comes  from  two  countries,  Russia  and  South 
Africa, Pd-based membrane materials play a major role in metal- 
lic membrane research. The demand for Pd has increased in the 
past several years, mostly from the automobile industry, while the 
market of mined supply has declined. Therefore, it is reasonable to 
minimize the use of Pd in metallic membranes. In fact, since pure- 
Pd membranes have limited use due to sulfur intolerance, thermal 
instability, and high cost, it has been of interest in the research 
community to improve such membrane material properties. Alloy- 
ing  of  Pd  membranes  with  other  metals  has  provided  enhanced 
sulfur resistance and thermal stability. Membranes based on non- 
precious metals also have proven enhanced thermal stability while 
decreasing  the  material  cost.  Computational  approaches  for  ma- 
terial  screening  could  provide  an  eﬃcient  way  to  enhance  new

membrane developments. The ongoing research to improve metal- 
lic membrane materials or develop new materials is fairly new and 
has yet to be fully explored. 

Moving to a hydrogen economy may be achieved through var- 
ious paths such as SMR, coal gasiﬁcation, geothermal, nuclear, re- 
newable energy resources (e.g., wind and solar), etc. Each of these 
paths have their own beneﬁts and drawbacks. There are numerous 
factors that must be investigated thoroughly before choosing the 
best path toward hydrogen economy. Renewability, cost, eﬃciency, 
GHG emissions, multigeneration, size reduction (land footprint), re- 
liability and durability, purity of the produced hydrogen are some 
key factors that the decision makers need to consider in their se- 
lection criteria. In addition, challenges for hydrogen delivery such 
as high delivery cost, low eﬃciency, purity, leakage and safety is- 
sues need to be addressed. Finally, in hydrogen production with 
CCUS units, the costs associated with CO 
2 sequestration, monitor- 
ing, and safe handling need to be studied with great precision as 
they might change the fate of the project. 

Although SMR is the dominant industrial process for hydrogen 
production, environmental concerns associated with CO 
2 emissions 
along with the process intensiﬁcation and energy optimization are 
the  areas  that  still  can  be  improved  signiﬁcantly.  Metallic  MRs 
have the potential to address both challenges. MRs inherently op- 
erate at signiﬁcantly lower operating pressures and temperatures 
while achieving similar performance to that of conventional reac- 
tors  which  require  higher  operating  pressures  and  temperatures. 
Hence, the capital and operating expenses could be considerably 
lower compared with the conventional reactors. 

The  benchmark  for  economic  production  of  hydrogen  by  the 
year 2020 has been determined and set in place by the U.S. DOE. 
The key factors set by the DOE are the energy yield of 60 gH 
2 /kWh 
which is equivalent to less than $2.00 per kg of produced hydro- 
gen in 2020. While established industrial processes such as SMR 
can easily meet the set limit by the DOE, it seems that the other 
processes such as water electrolysis, electron beam radiolysis, and 
gliding arc technologies do not meet this requirement presently. 
Among these methods water electrolysis has attracted signiﬁcant 
attention due to the low CO 
2 emissions associated with the elec- 
trolysis process. However, it should be noted that electricity is one 
of  the  most  important  components  of  water  electrolysis  process 
and depending on the sources of electricity, hydrogen cost could 
vary signiﬁcantly. Therefore, only reporting the CO 
2 emissions as- 
sociated with the water electrolysis process itself and not mention- 
ing the emissions associated with the electricity used in the pro- 
cess could be misleading. In order to realize the true emissions as- 
sociated with the water electrolysis a careful life-cycle-assessment, 
from cradle to grave, is necessary. Furthermore, it is still a matter 
of disagreement if it is the best way to use water in remote areas 
where access to water is challenging and costly. 

Among the methods that use plasma technology for hydrogen 
production, plasmatron method could be very eﬃcient in terms of 
performance, energy yield, and production rate. However, all these 
methods suffer from the extremely high capital and operating ex- 
penditures. 

Finally,  considering  the  currently  low  gas  prices,  and  the  le- 
nient  regulations  on  GHG  emissions,  it  seems  that  SMR  process 
will stay the dominant process for hydrogen production in the in- 
dustry. However, it needs to be emphasized that in the wake of 
our changing climate and the subsequent existential threats to hu- 
man civilization, governments and their policy makers will need 
to respond more proactively by adopting policies that advocate for 
more sustainable, low-carbon solutions to meeting our global en- 
ergy needs, which will bridge us toward a future that is less de- 
pendent on fossil fuels. Nevertheless, due to their modular char- 
acteristics, MRs show great potential to be used for smaller-scale 

hydrogen production while optimizing the energy consumption as- 
sociated with the process.
