Contents

The mono-alkyl esters, most commonly the methyl esters, of vegetable oils, animal fats or other mate-
rials consisting mainly of triacylglycerols, often referred to as biodiesel, are an alternative to conventional
petrodiesel for use in compression-ignition engines. The fatty acid esters that thus comprise biodiesel
largely determine many important fuel properties. In turn, the composition of the biodiesel depends on
the composition of the parent feedstock because feedstocks with widely varying fatty acid composition
can be used for biodiesel production. The use of different feedstocks is also significant under aspects of
increasing biodiesel supply and socio-economic issues. In this article, biodiesel production is briefly de-
scribed, followed by a discussion of biodiesel fuel properties and the influence of varying fatty acid profiles
and feedstocks. It is shown that the properties of biodiesel least influenced by minor components can
be determined by a straightforward equation in which the properties of the biodiesel fuel are calcu-
lated from the amounts of the individual component fatty esters and their properties. Optimizing biodiesel
composition is also addressed.

1. Introduction

The search for a variety of energy sources is nearly as old as man-
kind’s need for energy. Increasing industrialization commencing in
the 19th century, spurred by the development of machines con-
verting the energy stored in a variety of resources to power, caused
this search to intensify. The internal combustion engine, in its two
major variations, the spark-ignition and compression-ignition (diesel)
engines, is a prime example. While fuels obtained from fossil sources
were investigated from the onset of these engines, biogenic mate-
rials also found some interest, primarily ethanol in the case of the
spark-ignition engine [1] and vegetable oils in the case of the com-
pression ignition engine [2]. Due to a variety of factors, petroleum
became the major source of fuels for both engines, although re-
search, testing and some use of the “alternative” biogenic fuels
continued for many years through approximately World War II and
then resumed with ever-increasing intensity, in the late 1970s and
early 1980s as a result of the energy crises of the 1970s.

That operational problems were associated with the use of veg-
etable oils in a diesel engine was recognized early [2], with high
viscosity being defined as a major cause of these problems. While
one paper states [3] that it is “academically necessary to split off
the glycerides and to run on the residual fatty acid,” other work goes
a step further by interchanging glycerol for ethanol by preparing
the ethyl esters of palm oil through a transesterification reaction,
with the Belgian patent 422877 probably being the first report of
what is termed biodiesel today [4,5] and testing them in an urban
bus [6]. This is probably the first documented use of what is now
termed biodiesel [7,8], namely the mono-alkyl esters of vegetable
oils or animal fats or other triacylglycerol-containing feedstocks. This
approach was then rediscovered approximately forty years later [9]
in the early stages of renewed interest in vegetable oils and their
derivatives as diesel fuel.

Besides preparing biodiesel, several other approaches have been
investigated over time with the objective of reducing the viscosity
of triacylglycerol-containing materials. These approaches are dilu-
tion with petrodiesel, microemulsification, and pyrolysis [10]. Besides
these four approaches, more recently another approach based on
a catalytic reaction termed hydrodeoxygenation, which affords a
mixture of hydrocarbons probably best called “renewable diesel”

and simulating the composition of petroleum-derived diesel fuel
(petrodiesel), has been developed [11,12]. The present article is,
however, concerned with biodiesel and the other approaches are
not discussed here.

With ever-increasing research interest as well as production and
use of methyl esters of plant oils as biodiesel, especially since the
mid- to late 1990s, standards were developed tailored largely toward
these methyl esters. The first standard was established in Austria
in 1991 followed by other European standards, most notably the
German standard DIN 51606. Standards in individual European coun-
tries have been superseded by the European standard EN 14214 [13].
In the United States, concurrently the biodiesel standard ASTM D6751
[14] was developed. It may be noted that ASTM D6751 states that
biodiesel meeting its specifications is to serve as blend stock for
blends with petrodiesel and therefore is applied to neat biodiesel.
Relatedly, the standard ASTM D7467 covers blends at levels of
6–20% biodiesel [15] and an ASTM specification WK52154 for
blends >20% is under development [16]. Blends of up to 5% bio-
diesel with petrodiesel are covered by the petrodiesel standard ASTM
D975 [17] with these blends required to meet the specifications for
neat petrodiesel. The EN and ASTM standards now often serve as
reference standards for other biodiesel standards world-wide. These
standards address a variety of fuel quality issues caused by the prop-
erties of the major fuel components, the mono-alkyl esters of fatty
acids, and by minor constituents (contaminants). It may be noted
that viscosity, in the form of kinematic viscosity, as the major issue
for using biodiesel instead of vegetable or plant oils, is limited in
these standards to ensure that alkyl (usually methyl) esters are
indeed used as biodiesel. Selected current specifications in the afore-
mentioned two standards are listed in Table 1.

Besides overall favorable properties for use as transportation fuel,
biodiesel has numerous other potential uses, although none of these
uses can compete with fuel in terms of volume. These uses include
heating oil [18,19], power generation [20], lubricants [21], plasti-
cizers [22], high boiling absorbents for cleaning of gaseous industrial
emissions [23], as well as various solvent applications, which are
also discussed here briefly. It is biodegradable [24–26] and, relatedly,
has also been tested as a possible oil spill remediation agent [27–31].
This application relates to the solvent properties briefly discussed
at the end of this article. A detailed discussion of the applications

the most commonly used alcohol with sodium methoxide (NaOCH3) being the preferable catalyst.

of biodiesel other than those discussed here is beyond the scope
of this article.

Besides the aforementioned driving forces, advantages of bio-
diesel are low or no sulfur content, no aromatics content, high flash
point, inherent lubricity, biodegradability, reduction of most regu-
lated exhaust emissions, miscibility with petrodiesel in all blend
ratios and compatibility with the existing fuel distribution infra-
structure. Technical challenges associated with biodiesel include
reduction of NOx exhaust emissions and improvement of oxida-
tive stability and cold flow properties. While the biodegradability
of biodiesel is frequently cited as an advantage, for example, in case
of spills in the environment, this also means that bacterial biomass
may grow during storage and form deposits that clog engines and
fuel lines [32,33].

The overall environmental benefit or damage derived from the
production and use of biodiesel needs to be evaluated on a “cradle-
to-grave” basis through life-cycle analyses (LCA). Biodiesel from
terrestrial sources is generally computed to have a positive energy
balance; i.e., more fuel energy is derived from the product than was
consumed to produce it. For example a life-cycle analysis for
soybean-derived biodiesel showed a positive energy ratio [34] and
a review of palm biodiesel LCA showed uniformly positive energy
ratios with dependence on system boundaries [35]. Aquatic feed-
stock like microalgae though may result in a negative energy balance.
While biodiesel was initially assumed to be “carbon-neutral,” the
agricultural inputs needed to grow the feedstock and the incurred
carbon debt from land-use change often mean that biodiesel use
may actually result in greater greenhouse emissions than if
petrodiesel were used [35]. Increased agriculture may also have neg-
ative impacts on waterways because of nitrification from fertilizer
runoff. So, while biodiesel has distinct advantages over petrodiesel
for the local environment, its impact on the global environment is
less clear. LCAs are dependent on system definition and the avail-
ability and quality of data. Value judgments will also have to be made
on the relative importance of each environmental impact. Which
one is more important than the other? Further developments in the
assessment of the desirability of a product will be necessary before
this question can be answered.

The economics of biodiesel have made it often dependent on
incentives in the form of subsidies, tax reductions or other regu-
lations to be competitive with petrodiesel. Therefore, it is of interest
to investigate other potential applications where biodiesel may be
technically and economically competitive. Development of other
products from non-oil feedstock components would also be criti-
cal, to improve both business and environmental profiles. The
business challenges faced by the biodiesel industry have led to the
slow adoption of innovative new manufacturing technologies in spite
of their many advantages as many of these require significant capital
inputs. Thus, while biodiesel has become a widely adopted alter-
native fuel, there remain many challenges that may prevent it from
being more widely used.

This article is concerned primarily with fuel properties largely
determined by the major components of biodiesel as each compo-
nent has a different combination of properties. Properties that will
be discussed here and how they are affected by the composition of
biodiesel from various feedstocks are the cetane number (CN), cold
flow, oxidative stability, kinematic viscosity, lubricity, and density.
How fuel properties can be influenced by minor constituents will
also be addressed.

Biodiesel is obtained by transesterifying vegetable oils or other
materials are largely comprised of triacylglycerols with monohy-
dric alcohols, most commonly methanol, to give the corresponding
mono-alkyl esters (Fig. 1) [7,8]. Thus, the fatty acid profile of bio-
diesel corresponds to that of the parent oil or fat from which it is
produced. As the least expensive alcohol, methanol has been com-
monly used to produce biodiesel. Thus, biodiesel is often referred
to as the fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) of a vegetable oil or animal
fat or other triacylglycerol-containing material. Both moieties, the
fatty acid chain and the alcohol functionality, contribute to the overall
properties of a fatty ester and therefore the properties imparted by
other alcohols (yielding fatty acid alkyl esters; FAAE) that could be
used for producing biodiesel should be considered. Accordingly, both
structural moieties will be discussed here.

2. Discussion

2.1. History and background

The diesel engine, a version of the internal combustion engine
relying on self-ignition of a fuel under conditions of elevated heat
and pressure (thus also often termed the compression-ignition
engine), was developed in the 1890s. Its inventor, Rudolf Diesel
(1858–1913), tested numerous fuels at that time as he describes
in his book Die Entstehung des Dieselmotors [36]. As Diesel de-
scribes in this book and elsewhere [36–38], the first use of a
vegetable oil as fuel for a diesel engine occurred at the World Ex-
position in Paris in 1900. At the request of the French Government,
which at that time was interested in developing fuels of local origin
for its African colonies for sake of energy independence, a small diesel
engine ran on peanut (groundnut) oil. Apparently, this was only one
of five diesel engines shown at that exposition [39]. In any case, as
Diesel reports, the engine ran smoothly on this fuel with the on-
lookers not noticing this ongoing experiment. Later on, through the
1920s until approximately the end of World War II, there are nu-
merous reports in the literature on the use of vegetable oils in diesel
engines, often under the theme of energy independence [2]. During
that time, several researchers recognized that the high viscosity of
vegetable oils can lead to operational problems such as engine de-
posits. One suggestion was to split off the glycerol moiety and run
the engine on fatty acids, although it was recognized that this ap-
proach could also cause operational issues [3]. Under current aspects,
probably the most interesting and significant work was described

39

in Belgian patent 422877 issued in 1937 to Chavanne [4]. In this
patent and some later publications [5,6], the ethyl esters of palm
oil, obtained by transesterification of the oil with ethanol, are de-
scribed. The first test of this fuel in 1938 in an urban bus is also
discussed [6].

Research on alternative fuels remained largely dormant in the
years after World War II until the energy crises of the 1970s spurred
renewed interest in this subject. In this connection, vegetable oils
were rediscovered as potential fuels for diesel engines. The prob-
ably first reports on esters of vegetable oils from this time date to
1980 [9]. In this work, researchers from South Africa describe the
use of methyl esters of sunflower oil in a diesel engine and that the
use of these esters alleviated the viscosity issue and subsequent op-
erational issues. As mentioned in Section 1, besides the reduction
of viscosity of a vegetable oil by transesterifying to alkyl esters, three
other solutions to the issue of high viscosity exist, namely
microemulsification, diluting with petrodiesel and pyrolysis. In any
case, transesterification is the approach to viscosity reduction that
ultimately received the most consideration and now alkyl esters of
vegetable oils are known as biodiesel. Methyl esters are the most
widely produced and used vegetable or plant oil esters, largely
because methanol is the most common and least expensive alcohol
available for this purpose. In more recent years, what may be seen
as a fifth approach to producing fuels from vegetable/plant oils, and
which has found some commercial application, has been devel-
oped. This process, giving a fuel probably best termed, as mentioned
in Section 1, “renewable diesel,” is the production of hydrocar-
bons emulating the components of petrodiesel via a process termed
hydrodeoxygenation [11,12]. In this process, the glycerol or car-
boxyl moiety is cleaved and the double bonds saturated so that
largely alkanes of shorter chain length arise. Thus, the “ideal” product
arising from triolein in this process would be heptadecane. The
process can be tailored with subsequent isomerization of the hy-
drocarbon chain to give fuels with improved cold flow properties
that are of interest as jet (aviation) fuels.

Besides the biodiesel standards mentioned above, numerous leg-
islative and regulatory efforts promoting the cause of biodiesel have
accompanied or facilitated its rising production and use. For example,
in the United States, biodiesel production in 2014 was approxi-
mately 6.65 billion liters after about 6.84 billion liters in 2013 [40],
and in the European Union it was approximately 10,367,000 metric
tons (approximately 11.77 billion liters) in 2013 with a produc-
tion capacity of 23,093,00 metric tons in 2014 [41]. Worldwide
production in 2014 has been at given as 29.7 billion liters (approx-
imately 26,144,000 metric tons), with the top producer being the
United States (4.7 billion liters) followed by Brazil and Germany (3.4
billion liters each), Indonesia (3.1 billion liters), Argentina (2.9 billion
liters), and France (2.1 billion liters), with the EU accounting for 11.6
billion liters [42]. Issues related to production that have affected bio-
diesel use include feedstock availability as not enough vegetable/
plant oils are produced to replace all petrodiesel, and the so-
called food vs. fuel issue which is based on the claim that fuel
production from edible oils may increase their price and reduce their
availability while also causing agricultural land to be used for fuel
instead of food production.

The output of research papers on biodiesel and related aspects
has increased exponentially, making biodiesel probably one of the
most-researched alternative fuels. Considerable research has been
devoted to addressing the technical issues facing biodiesel, which
have impaired its even more widespread commercialization and use.
These issues include the properties at low temperatures (cold flow
issues), stability toward oxygen and other materials, especially while
stored, and the reduction of nitrogen oxides (NOx) exhaust emis-
sions, one of the four kinds of exhaust emissions affected by
regulations. The issue of feedstock availability mentioned above has
caused a search for additional feedstocks. The transesterification

reaction has received considerable research attention also, mainly
the search for additional and/or improved catalysts.

This article will focus on the technical issues that have been
facing biodiesel, as well as discuss the fuel and physical proper-
ties of biodiesel, as these issues are largely a result of the properties
of the components of biodiesel. The issue of feedstocks will be
addressed by primarily focusing on their varying composition
and how this may affect the use of the biodiesel fuels derived from
them.

2.2. Biodiesel production

2.2.1. Transesterification

Summarily, transesterification is the production of one ester from
another ester. In the case of biodiesel, this is the production of
mono-alkyl esters from a vegetable/plant oil which consists largely
of triacylglycerols, i.e., the glycerol esters of long-chain fatty acids,
with a low molecular-weight alcohol. As indicated above, metha-
nol is currently the preferred alcohol for this purpose, giving the
methyl esters of the plant oil with a fatty acid profile correspond-
ing to that of the parent oil.

The transesterification reaction is well-known and is, to a sig-
nificant extent, textbook material. It can be catalyzed by both acids
and bases, with base catalysis being considerably more rapid [43].
The overall reaction, which is reversible, is shown in Fig. 1.

The most advantageous reaction conditions were established as
a molar ratio alcohol:oil of 6:1, 60 °C, 1 h with either 0.5% sodium
methoxide (CH3ONa) or 1% sodium hydroxide as preferred cata-
lyst when using methanol as alcohol [43]. Generally, the reaction
temperature should be slightly below the boiling point of the alcohol.
The 6:1 molar ratio is a 100% increase over the theoretical amount,
which is necessary to drive the equilibrium to the right. Further-
more, the free fatty acid content should be less than 0.5% (acid value
of less than approximately 1) and the reaction system as free of mois-
ture as possible. Thus, production of biodiesel is becoming more
common on a commercial scale using sodium methoxide as cata-
lyst because this catalyst helps maintain low moisture content. The
reason is that when using an alkoxide, such as sodium methoxide
as catalyst, the water-forming reaction

occurring when using hydroxide catalysts is avoided.

At the beginning of the transesterification reaction, the mixture
of vegetable oil and methanol consists of two immiscible phases,
the vegetable oil and the alcohol. This leads to a situation where
mass transfer may be limiting the overall reaction rate rather than
the actual chemical reaction. Similarly, at the end of the reaction
two phases occur, the methyl esters product and glycerol as co-
product. The two phases can be easily separated by gravity (settling
of the phases) or centrifugation but the latter is energy intensive.
Washing the product ester phase with water is necessary to remove
the remaining catalyst and potential contaminants such as glycer-
ol formed during the reaction.

The transesterification occurs stepwise, proceeding from the
triacylglycerol starting material via the di- and monoacylglycerols
to glycerol, with methyl ester being formed at each step. Although
under optimal conditions, the transesterification reaction pro-
ceeds to a very high degree of conversion, minor to trace amounts
of triacylglycerol starting material as well as mono- and
diacylglycerols remain. Even very minor amounts of some of these
materials can significantly influence fuel properties. Thus glycerol
and the various triacylglycerols are limited in biodiesel standards
as free and total glycerol, respectively, with monoacylglycerols being
limited individually in both the ASTM and EN standards while the
other acylglycerols are limited individually only in the EN standard.

Fig. 2. Biodiesel production process, as commonly practiced in industry.

If the feedstock contains a significant amount of free fatty acids
as is often the case with low-quality feedstocks such as used cooking
oils, trap grease or animal fats, an acid pre-treatment step is usually
employed to reduce the free fatty acid content [44]. This pretreat-
ment consists of esterifying the free fatty acids in the feedstocks
to the methyl esters using the desired alcohol and an acid catalyst
(H2SO4), thereby reducing the acid value. The triacylglycerol portion
of the feedstock can then be transesterified by base catalysis using
the conditions described above.

The “conventional” process for biodiesel production is shown in
Fig. 2. The aforementioned sensitivity of the transesterification re-
action under what might be termed the “standard conditions” toward
moisture, free fatty acid content, mass transfer limitations and other
factors has caused significant research efforts toward developing
other process systems. While it is beyond the scope of this article
to deal with these aspects in detail, some salient aspects are briefly
discussed here.

Process improvements have approached these concerns by: (a)
improving contact between the oil and alcohol phases, either chem-
ically or mechanically; (b) heterogeneous and enzymatic catalysts;
(c) simultaneous extraction and reaction; (d) reaction with simul-
taneous removal of the product; and (e) microwave irradiation.
Combinations of all of these have also been extensively studied.

2.2.2. Reducing or eliminating mass-transfer effects

Novel reactor designs have improved the contact between the
oil and methanol phases beyond that which can be achieved using
a common paddle-type impeller [45]. These include static mixers
[46], micro-channel reactors [47], slit channel reactors [48], oscil-
latory flow reactors [49], and rotating tube reactors [50]. Particularly
interesting is the use of ultrasound to induce the formation of
cavitational microbubbles whose collapse induces better convec-
tion and mixing [51,52].

Mass transfer limitations have also been addressed by perform-
ing the transesterification at supercritical conditions: ~ 573–
673 K and ~15–45 MPa [53]. At these conditions, the reaction mixture
is in one phase only and thus interphase mass transfer constraints
are eliminated. At supercritical conditions, the reaction proceeds

rapidly with a high yield without a catalyst and is insensitive to the
presence of water and free fatty acids. Thus, the system provides
twin advantages over the conventional process for transesterification.
Waste and crude oils may be used without initial pretreatment. Fur-
thermore, catalyst removal and separation will be unnecessary. The
high pressures and temperatures would drive up capital equip-
ment costs however. High alcohol-oil molar ratios are also necessary.
Safety concerns have also been raised about the use of flammable
solvents at very high temperatures and pressures. Jet fires having
an effect as distant as 190 m have been predicted in the case of a
methanol pump rupture [54].

Another approach for eliminating mass transfer limitations is the
use of co-solvents like tetrahydrofuran [55], dimethyl ether [56] and
methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) [57] to improve the miscibility of
the oil and alcohol. With the co-solvents, the reaction mixtures are
now single phase and the overall reaction rate is greatly enhanced.

2.2.3. Heterogeneous catalysts

Heterogeneous catalysts have found significant interest as they
usually can be recycled many times and thus avoid having to use
fresh methoxide (or hydroxide or other alkoxide) for each reac-
tion batch. Separation is also simplified, the need for washing is
reduced and continuous operation becomes simpler. The activity
of these catalysts to affect the transesterification reaction dimin-
ishes with time. It also appears that many papers concerned with
this kind do not address the question of catalyst leaching and how
that may affect biodiesel storage and properties and meeting speci-
fications, especially those addressing the heteroatoms Na, K, Mg,
Ca, P and S (if the catalysts contain these elements) in biodiesel stan-
dards. Some catalysts may contain other heteroelements not
addressed in biodiesel standards and the impact of these ele-
ments on fuel quality has not yet been fully addressed.

Research on various catalysts for the transesterification has been
so extensive that numerous reviews now deal with specialized
aspects such as certain classes of catalysts and even catalysts con-
taining specific metals, etc. Recent reviews [58,59] cover most of
the chemistry behind new heterogeneous catalysts. In these reviews
and as in many other biodiesel heterogeneous catalysis papers,

41

mass-transfer effects are not considered extensively. If heteroge-
neous catalysts are used, the three phases arise: alcohol, oil and
catalyst. Mass-transfer effects are often discussed only in the context
of systems designed to eliminate or reduce mass-transfer-limitations,
e.g. ultrasound [60]. Notable exceptions are studies concerning CaO
catalysts [61,62]. Until the mass-transfer effects and leaching effects
are addressed, it would be premature to discuss detailed kinetics
of any of the other heterogeneous catalysts. Despite the innumer-
able reports on alternative catalysts for the transesterification
reaction, it is unclear whether any have been used in commercial
production due to a lack of reports in the open literature.

Enzymatic catalysis [63–65] shares many of the advantages of
inorganic heterogeneous catalysts. Products are more easily recov-
ered and, in general, product quality is improved. In addition,
enzymes promise to be more environmentally friendly and are
usually more tolerant toward moisture content and the quality of
the feedstock. Reaction times are longer, however, and the enzymes
are expensive. Costs are very system dependent but it is worth men-
tioning a study that determined that a biodiesel produced via an
immobilized lipase system was about twice as expensive as one pro-
duced with a conventional alkali system [66].

Other means of catalyzing the transesterification process include

whole-cell biocatalysts [67] and ionic liquids [68].

2.2.4. Direct contact between feedstock and alcohol

Integration of the oil extraction step with the transesterification
step has been investigated [69], a process called in situ
transesterification or reactive extraction. This process could elim-
inate the use of hexane as extraction solvent for the oil feedstock.
Some good results have been obtained but most of these pro-
cesses have required high solvent-to-oil ratios, thus deviating from
the “standard” conditions mentioned in Section 2.2.1., possibly
because a large amount is necessary to physically cover dry feed-
stocks [70]. It is a method, however, to be investigated in connection
with the transesterification of feedstocks of aqueous origin like
microalgae [71] because it eliminates the drying step that is a major
energy load on microalgal processes. Like the heterogeneous
catalytic systems, in situ transesterification will yield a three-
phase system (alcohol, oil and feedstock solids), hence in situ
transesterification is often combined with the methods to promote
mass transfer mentioned earlier. These include co-solvents [70], ul-
trasound [51] and operating at supercritical conditions [58].

2.2.5. Early product removal to drive equilibrium

In conventional transesterification, a large excess of alcohol,
usually 100% more than theoretical, is fed in order to ensure that
the equilibrium is driven forward and the limiting reactant (oil) is
consumed. While the methanol may be recovered and recycled, this
increases the cost for separation. One of the techniques being studied
to avoid this is the use of membrane reactors, which allow contin-
uous separation of the reactants from the products as they are
formed [72]. A similar concept is reactive distillation wherein a re-
active middle section is sandwiched between a top section where
recovery of solvents can be done and recovery of the heavier FAME
product can be done. Because it also involves heat integration, re-
active distillation has been shown to be an effective solution both
in theory [73] and in experiments [74].

2.2.6. Microwave irradiation

The use of microwave irradiation for heating chemical reac-
tions is not simply a more efficient method for heating. Microwaves
promote selective heating of polar molecules which result in local
temperatures that are actually higher than the bulk temperature [75].
The apparent activation energy is thus lower and the overall reac-
tion rate is higher. Catalyst requirements can also be reduced. The

use of microwaves, however, places restrictions on the reaction vessel
size and shape.

2.3. Biodiesel feedstocks

The starting materials used for biodiesel production are vege-
table oils (or more generally, plant oils) or other oils and fats
consisting largely of triacylglycerols. The most common feed-
stocks in the past and up to the present have been commodity
vegetable oils such as rapeseed (low-erucic variety; canola being
similar to low-erucic rapeseed), palm, soybean and coconut. This
observation is confirmed by the historical research described above
carried out on oils such as peanut, palm and sunflower. The issue
of expanding the base of feedstocks has led to significant interest
in other potential source of triacylglycerol-based oils [76].

A common feature of most vegetable/plant oils is that most of
their fatty acid profile is comprised of the five most common fatty
acids palmitic (hexadecanoic), stearic (octadecanoic), oleic (9(Z)-
octadecenoic), linoleic (9(Z),12(Z)-octadecadienoic) and linolenic
(9(Z),12(Z),15(Z)-octadecatrienoic). The amounts of these acids vary
among the oils though, and because their methyl esters have dif-
ferent properties the biodiesel fuels derived from these oils also show
varying properties. Some plant oils, on the other hand, for example
castor, coriander, cuphea and meadowfoam, exhibit fatty acid pro-
files with other fatty acids as major components, again significantly
influencing the fuel properties of the biodiesel derived from these
oils. Minor components, however, which may include other fatty
acid methyl esters in the fatty acid profile, as well as steryl gluco-
sides, monoacylglycerols and other acylglycerols remaining in the
product after the transesterification reaction, and materials carried
over from the feedstock often can significantly influence biodiesel
fuel properties.

As the cost of biodiesel production is largely (about 75–80%) de-
termined by the cost of the feedstock, less expensive feedstocks have
been of interest for a considerable length of time. These low-cost
feedstocks include used cooking oils, greases and animal fats. While
their cost is lower, they also usually are of lower quality, almost
always exhibiting high acid values and/or water content and pres-
ence of extraneous materials, necessitating quality improvement
before biodiesel production.

Several other issues have led to an intense search for other
vegetable/plant oils as additional feedstocks. These issues include
(a) expanding the base of feedstocks to potentially increase bio-
diesel supply; (b) the use of commodity oils for nutritional purposes
and the claim that therefore the production of biodiesel from them
affects food prices; (c) the issue of land-use change, i.e., the use of
agricultural land for “growing fuel” instead of food or change of use
of virgin land to agricultural use for this purpose of “growing fuel”;
and (d) the use of pesticides and fertilizers needed to grow these
feedstocks and which can leach into groundwater or bodies of water.
Therefore, “alternative” sources of biodiesel are often waste or in-
edible oils and/or plants growing on land unsuitable for agriculture.
A prominent example of an “alternative” feedstock presented often
as very promising is jatropha [77,78]. In some recent publications
it has been discussed, however, that the hopes and assumptions as-
sociated with this potential feedstock have been overstated [79–81].
While most of these feedstocks, including jatropha, exhibit the afore-
mentioned five most common fatty acids as the major components
of their fatty acid profiles, some feedstocks may have fatty acid pro-
files deviating more strongly from the five major fatty acids as major
components, so that property assessment is critical here, too.

Terrestrial plants that have been investigated as biodiesel sources
are listed in Tables 2 and 3, which are updates of tables previously
published [82]. Table 2 lists those that have been investigated on
a laboratory scale while Table 3 lists those that have been investi-
gated in an engine, including those that have indicated that the

cetane number was tested using a cetane engine. Splitting the list
into these two scales of development is a useful indicator of the level
of interest in the feedstock and the availability of materials for more
extensive testing. The feedstocks from the family Fabaceae are in-
teresting because these plants are diazotrophic or nitrogen-fixing,
that is, they are able to utilize nitrogen from the air. This ability
makes the use of fertilizers unnecessary and reduces cultivation
costs and environmental impact. Halophytic plants like polanga
(Calophyllum inophyllum) and sea mango (Cerbera odollam) share the
ability to grow in salty soil with more established oil crops like palm
and coconut. Seashore mallow (Kosteletzkya pentacarpos) is an
example of a temperate zone plant that can grow in salty environ-
ments. The Brassicaceae and Euphorbiaceae are also interesting
because these are mostly herbs or shrubs, which reduce the cost
of harvesting. In contrast to large trees, there is also less biomass
“overhead” required to grow the plant. Other noteworthy plants are
those that are commonly regarded as weeds such as yellow nut sedge
(Cyperus esculentus) and Indian milkweed (Calotropis gigantea) since
these indicate that they are easy to grow.

Many of the plants listed in Tables 2 and 3 are significant agri-
cultural wastes including rubber seed, rice bran, tobacco seed, coffee
grounds, defective coffee beans olive pomace, pili pulp, papaya seed,
tea seed, pumpkin seed and avocado seed. They are byproducts from
the production of a more highly valued product and so are essentially

free. Utilization of these would eliminate or mitigate a waste stream.
Multi-product plants like moringa are also noteworthy.

Animal fats have been studied in a similar context as waste
cooking oils [193–196]. The waste animal cooking oils originate from
commercial-scale livestock or fish rendering operations and are thus
easily collected from waste streams. Waste animal fats offer twin
advantages of mitigating a waste stream and generating a side
revenue. Because the feedstock cost is essentially zero, the result-
ing product is much less costly in spite of additional processing steps
required to separate the oil from water and other impurities [197].
Compared to vegetable oils, animal fats have more saturated fatty
acids, leading to some additional handling and distribution prob-
lems because the feedstock is often solid and the resulting product
tends to have poor cold flow properties [149,195]. An exception is
fish oils. Fish oils, similar to algal oils, usually contain consider-
able amounts of unsaturated fatty acids but these are mostly long-
chain such that the net effect is still poor cold flow properties [198].
On the other hand, methyl esters from butter had approximately
20% C6–C12 methyl esters which led to poor results in flash point
while oxidation stability was also low [199]. Nonetheless, in spite
of some poor results at a lab scale, commercial scale biodiesel pro-
duction from waste animal fats has been done in many locations
around the world [81].

Waste vegetable oils have also been studied but other than the
challenges of collection, pretreatment and variability of composi-
tion [200], it is not expected that there would be any significantly
different treatment of the waste vegetable oils from virgin oils.

Biodiesel is one of the many biofuels that have been proposed to
be obtainable from single-cell organisms such as microalgae, yeast,
molds, cyanobacteria and bacteria [201]. Photosynthetic microalgae
have attracted the most attention because they offer many advan-
tages including a photosynthetic efficiency higher than terrestrial plants
and the possibility of using non-arable land for cultivation [202].
Immense technical challenges, however, must be overcome before
microalgal biofuels can reach commercial success. Many microalgal
oils contain significant amounts of long-chain polyunsaturated
fatty acids so these may negatively impact important properties such
as oxidative stability [198]. On a life-cycle basis, as compared to ter-
restrial plants, microalgae require considerably more inputs such as
nitrogen fertilizers and energy for harvest and post-harvest treat-
ment. Microalgae are grown in either open ponds or closed
photobioreactors and these consume significant amounts of energy.
The most basic measure of the feasibility of an energy system may
be the energy efficiency ratio (EER) or the energy return on invest-
ment (EROI), which is defined as the ratio of energy inputs required
to the amount of energy produced. Thus, an EER of 1 indicates break-
even. It has been suggested that an EROI or EER of more than 5 [203]
or even 7 [204] is the minimum necessary for the sustainability of
an energy system. While life-cycle assessments (LCA) are very system-
dependent, reviews of extant LCA studies show that most fall far below
this standard [203]. Many of the environmental impacts of large-
scale microalgal culture are still incompletely known [205]. Using
wastewater as a feed may alleviate some of the energy and environ-
mental burdens but these may carry further complications like
inconsistent composition and pathogens [205]. There have been many
attempts to commercialize the technology with significant amounts
of venture capital (see, for example [206],). While microalgal tech-
nology is conceptually attractive, there are many technological
breakthroughs that must be achieved before viable commercial im-
plementation can be achieved [207].

Cyanobacteria, also called blue-green algae, share many advan-
tages with microalgae and have another advantage in that they are
also capable of generating reactive or fixed nitrogen from the air.
This removes the need for the addition of fertilizers to the culture
media. This quality plus the production of other fuels from the cya-
nobacteria offers the possibility of a favorable energy balance [208].

The other single-cell organisms studied as biodiesel feedstock
like yeast [209] and mold [210] are heterotrophic; i.e., they rely on
chemical sources of energy and are not photosynthetic. While the
focus has been mostly on using waste materials as substrates, we
are not aware of any life-cycle assessments having been done for
these systems. Given the unfavorable results for the photosyn-
thetic microorganisms, it is unlikely that a favorable EROI would be
achieved with these systems.

Insects have also been studied as possible feedstocks. The value
of using insects as feedstock is premised on their use to degrade
solid wastes [211] and the presence of significant amounts of lipids
in insect biomass [212]. Some biodiesel fuel testing has been done
and as with other animal-sourced biodiesels the cold-flow prop-
erties tend to be poor [213]. While automated harvesting systems
have been developed [211], the cost trade-offs are unknown and
it is difficult to see how this can be implemented on a sufficiently
large scale.

2.4. Biodiesel analysis

A major issue ensuring the commercialization and marketabil-
ity of biodiesel is fuel quality assurance, as indicated above, by
limiting the extraneous materials that can be present as they can
negatively influence fuel properties and performance. These unde-
sirable components include minor constituents formed during the
transesterification reaction such as glycerol and the various
acylglycerols as mentioned in Section 2.2.1. The issue of the
acylglycerols and glycerol is addressed in biodiesel standards by the
specifications for monoacylglycerols as well as free and total glyc-
erol, the latter specification encompassing all acylglycerols and
glycerol (Table 1). Other possible minor components of biodiesel
that can negatively affect fuel quality or performance and combus-
tion behavior are trace elements (“heteroelements”) which can be
caused by residual catalyst or carry-over from the feedstocks. The
elements that are limited in biodiesel standards are Na, K. S, P, Ca
and Mg (Table 1). The biodiesel should also be as free of fatty acid
as possible as addressed by the acid value as free fatty acids may
cause corrosion and have elevated melting points. Various other
specifications in biodiesel standards address other issues, such as
the flash point limiting residual alcohol, and some specifications are
redundant.

Numerous analytical methods have been developed for these
minor components. Especially noteworthy are the gas chromato-
graphic methods for determining free and total glycerol which are
the standards ASTM D6584 [214] and EN 14105 [215]. Overviews
of various methods for analyzing different aspects of the finished
biodiesel product as well as monitoring the transesterification re-
action, which includes spectroscopic methods such as infrared (IR)
and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), are available in the liter-
ature [216–220].

Another issue is that of determining blend levels of biodiesel in
petrodiesel. For this purpose, IR spectroscopic methods are uti-
lized in standards such as ASTM D7371 [221], ASTM D7806 [222]
and EN 14078 [223], including for analysis of trace amounts of bio-
diesel in aviation fuel such as ASTM D7797 [224].

2.5. Biodiesel fuel properties

The properties that will be discussed here are those that are to
a significant extent determined by the fatty ester composition of
the diesel fuel. These are kinematic viscosity, cetane number and
other combustion-related properties, cold flow, oxidative stability
and density. Lubricity, which is not a performance issue with
biodiesel and therefore influenced only marginally by the fatty acid
profile, will also be discussed.

As will be obvious from the following discussion, the proper-
ties of mixtures that generally do not pose operational problems
can be predicted by the general equation

Pr

mix

=

×∑
A
C

Pr
C

(2)

in which Prmix is the property of the mixture being predicted, AC = the
relative amount (vol.−%; or amount as determined by gas chroma-
tography) of an individual neat ester in the mixture, and PrC is the
property of the individual neat ester. In other words, these prop-
erties vary proportionally with the amounts of the individual
components and their properties. These properties are kinematic
viscosity, cetane number and density as discussed below in the cor-
responding sections.

On the other hand, the properties associated with operational
problems when using biodiesel cannot be predicted using the ap-
propriate variation of Eq. (2). These properties are oxidative stability
and cold flow. Minor FAME components influence these proper-
ties more strongly than indicated by the amounts.

Correlations of properties are possible only for classes of
compounds possessing the same structural features or well-
defined parameters. Thus saturated compounds can be primarily
compared only among themselves, monounsaturated compounds
among themselves. For example, it is not possible to correlate ki-
nematic viscosity only to the number of carbon atoms in the chain.
Correlation in this case can be only among saturated or among
monounsaturated or among diunsaturated compounds or among
triunsaturated compounds, etc.

Furthermore, properties based primarily on the structure of the
component fatty acid alkyl esters of biodiesel compound structure-
based properties such as cetane number and kinematic viscosity,
etc. cannot be correlated with properties such as flash point,
etc., which primarily serve to limit certain minor constituents/
contaminants in biodiesel.

The greatest change in properties occurs when going from the
saturated FA chain to the monounsaturated FA chain. Subsequent
transitions to even more double bonds have less effect as evi-
denced by data for properties such as kinematic viscosity, cetane
number, and oxidative stability.

2.5.1. Kinematic viscosity

Kinematic viscosity is the property of fatty compounds that is
to a large extent the cause for the production of biodiesel, thus being
a major reason why neat vegetable oils have been largely aban-
doned as alternative diesel fuel. Viscosity not only affects flow at
all temperatures a fuel may be exposed to but also strongly influ-
ences the atomization of a fuel upon injection into the combustion
chamber and ultimately the possible formation of engine depos-
its. The higher the viscosity, the greater is the tendency of the fuel
to cause such problems. The viscosity of biodiesel in the form of
methyl esters is about an order of magnitude lower than that of the
parent oil. Kinematic viscosity has been included in most bio-
diesel standards and can be determined by standards such as ASTM
D445 [225] or ISO 3104 [226].

The kinematic viscosity of individual fatty acid alkyl esters is af-
fected by structural factors such as chain length as well as the
number and nature of double bonds. Viscosity increases with chain
length (number of carbon atoms) and with increasing degree of sat-
uration. This holds also for the alcohol moiety, the viscosity of ethyl
esters being slightly higher than that of methyl esters. Double bond
configuration also influences viscosity. Compounds with cis double
bonds exhibit lower viscosity than those with trans configuration,
the kinematic viscosity of the latter being relatively close to that
of the saturated compounds with the same number of carbon atoms
[227]. Branching in the ester moiety, however, has little influence
on viscosity, showing that this is a technically promising approach

for improving low-temperature properties (see discussion on cold
flow properties below) without significantly affecting other fuel prop-
erties. Table 4 contains experimental kinematic viscosity data (at
40 °C) for common fatty acid methyl esters as they occur in bio-
diesel. Kinematic viscosity data at temperatures below 40 °C are
available in other literature [230]. Other literature often presents
dynamic viscosity data for biodiesel and its components, but these
data are not included in Table 4 as kinematic viscosity is pre-
scribed in biodiesel standards and dynamic viscosity can be easily
calculated from kinematic viscosity by their relationship through
density.

Most biodiesel fuels meet the kinematic viscosity range pre-
scribed in biodiesel standards (Table 1) as most common fatty
acid methyl esters possess kinematic viscosity values in that range,
for example, the kinematic viscosity at 40 °C of methyl oleate is
4.51 mm2/s and that of methyl palmitate is 4.38 mm2/s. For the
sake of comparison the kinematic viscosity values (40 °C) of some
triacylglycerols are 32.94 for triolein, 24.91 for trilinolein and 17.29
for trilinolenin [227].

The kinematic viscosity of a mixture of fatty esters can be de-
termined by an equation in which the overall kinematic viscosity
is directly proportional to amounts and viscosities of the individual
components [228]. This equation is

ν

in which νmix = the kinematic viscosity of the biodiesel sample
(mixture of fatty acid alkyl esters), AC = the relative amount (%/
100) of the individual neat ester in the mixture (as determined by,
for example, gas chromatography) and νC = kinematic viscosity of
the individual esters. This approach is a simplification of the well-
known Grunberg–Nissan equation usually applied for predicting
dynamic viscosity.

As an example for the prediction of the kinematic viscosity of
a mixture, the kinematic viscosity (40 °C) of soy methyl esters (SME)
in the literature has usually been reported to be in the range of
4.0–4.1 mm2/s. This range for the kinematic viscosity of SME values
agrees well with the application of this equation using the kinematic

viscosity values given in Table 1 to a typical fatty acid profile of SME
being approximately 11% 16:0, 4% 18:0, 24% 18:1 Δ9c, 1% 18:1 Δ11c,
52% 18:2 and 8% 18:3. The effect on viscosity of blending bio-
diesel and petrodiesel was studied [231] and an equation was derived
which allows the calculation of the viscosity of such blends.

The prediction of viscosity of fatty materials has received con-
siderable attention in the literature with a variety of approaches
having been established. An issue of interest in this connection is
the contribution of compounds with melting points >40 °C to the
overall kinematic viscosity of biodiesel at this temperature, which
is the temperature prescribed in biodiesel standards. Fatty esters
with melting points >40 °C are usually only saturated fatty esters
with fatty acid chain lengths ≥C20. Obviously, their (hypothetical)
kinematic viscosity is greater than that of the shorter-chain com-
pounds that are liquids at 40 °C. As their contribution to the overall
kinematic viscosity of a mixture cannot be determined directly, ex-
trapolation of the kinematic viscosity of saturated fatty acid methyl
esters with melting points <40 °C is applied. Thus a third-order poly-
nomial equation

Calculated kinematic viscosity contributions (values in parenthe-
ses) for methyl eicosanoate (methyl arachidate), methyl docosanoate
(methyl behenate), and methyl tetracosanoate are also given in
Table 4. These values can be used like the experimental values for
the other compounds for calculating overall kinematic viscosity ac-
cording to Eq. (3).

2.5.2. Combustion-related properties: cetane number, speed of
sound, heat of combustion, exhaust emissions

The final stage of the life cycle of a fuel is its combustion in an
engine. Besides the technology level of the engine, numerous prop-
erties affect the efficiency and products of combustion of a diesel
fuel. One of the most prominent properties in this connection is the
cetane number (CN). Generally, the dimensionless CN is a prime in-
dicator of diesel fuel quality as it relates to the ignition behavior
of the fuel. The higher the CN, the shorter the ignition delay time,
i.e. the time that passes between injection of the fuel into the cyl-
inder and the onset of ignition and vice versa. Shorter ignition delay
times are generally desirable.

A cetane scale has been established which is the basis of the
determination of CNs by standards that have been established world-
wide including ASTM D613 [232] in the United States and the
International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard ISO
5165. The American standard ASTM D975 [17] for petrodiesel re-
quires a minimum CN of 40 and the European petrodiesel standard
EN 590 [233] prescribes a minimum CN of 51 while the standards
for biodiesel prescribe a minimum of 47 in ASTM D6751 or 51 in
EN 14214. A long straight-chain hydrocarbon, hexadecane (C16H34;
trivial name cetane), is the high quality standard on the cetane scale
with an assigned CN of 100. Highly branched 2,2,4,4,6,8,8,-
heptamethylnonane (HMN; also C16H34), which possesses poor
ignition quality, is the low-quality standard with a CN of 15. The
two reference compounds on the cetane scale show that the CN de-
creases with decreasing chain length and increasing branching.
Aromatic compounds, which occur in significant amounts in
petrodiesel, have low CNs but their CNs increase with increasing
size of n-alkyl side chains [234,235]. Compounds with CN > 100 or
CN < 15 have been identified on the cetane scale.

As CN determination by the traditional standard ASTM D613 con-
sumes a significant amount of fuel sample, an apparatus termed the
Ignition Quality TesterTM (IQTTM) was developed, which also offers
the benefit of easier use. It forms the basis of the standard ASTM

D6890 [236], in which a derived cetane number (DCN) is obtained
that correlates with the CN obtained by the traditional standard.
Most CN data presented here were obtained as DCNs using the IQTTM
[237,238].

Probably the first CN test of what is now known as biodiesel was
conducted with palm oil ethyl esters [2,6]. This material had a high
CN, a result confirmed by later studies on many other vegetable oil-
based diesel fuels and individual fatty compounds. Furthermore, as
indicated above by the differing CNs of hexadecane and HMN, struc-
tural elements define the CN of a specific compound. Thus branching
in the chain reduces CN as shown by the comparison of hexadecane
and HMN; however, increasing unsaturation also decreases the CN.
The double bond position also plays a role with CN having been pre-
dicted to be higher if the double bond is located toward one end
of the chain than toward the middle of the chain [239]. Several
reports on experimental cetane number determination confirm these
insights [240–242]. Thus, one long straight chain suffices to impart
a high CN even if the other moiety is branched. Accordingly, highly
polyunsaturated FAME with C20 and C22 chain lengths as found in
many algal oils therefore have low CNs [229]. On the other hand,
double bond configuration does not significantly affect CN [238].
Branched esters, however, derived from alcohols such as iso-
propanol have CNs competitive with methyl or other straight-
chain alkyl esters [237]. Branched esters are of interest because they
exhibit improved low-temperature properties as discussed below.
Table 5 lists the CNs of FAMEs, most of which were determined
using ASTM D6890. Many FAMEs have high CNs, imparting overall
CNs to biodiesel higher than those of many petrodiesel fuels. Gen-
erally, the CNs of low-CN compounds show better agreement in the

literature than those of compounds with higher CNs. The cause of
this is the non-linear relationship between the ignition delay time
and the CN [237]. Thus, small changes at shorter ignition delay times
result in greater changes in CN than at longer ignition delay times.
Similar to the approach used for kinematic viscosity, the CNs of
mixtures such as biodiesel can be approximated by the equation
in which the overall CN is proportional to the amount and CNs of
the individual components

CN

in which CNmix is the CN of the mixture, AC = the relative amount
(vol.−%) of an individual neat ester in the mixture, and CNC is the
CN of the individual neat ester [229,238]. With this equation and
using data from Table 5, the CN of biodiesel from soybean oil (SBO)
is approximately 50 when assuming a typical fatty acid profile of
soy methyl esters as discussed above for kinematic viscosity. This
result agrees well with published CN data for soy methyl esters which
are usually in the upper 40s to low 50s.

Ideally, only carbon dioxide and water are the combustion prod-
ucts of a hydrocarbon. As combustion is not completely ideal, a
variety or other products are formed. Among these other products
are hydrocarbons, particulate matter, carbon monoxide and nitro-
gen oxides, which are also the species addressed by exhaust
emissions regulations.

For petrodiesel, higher CNs were correlated with reduced ni-
trogen oxides (NOx) exhaust emissions [244], although the
relationship between the CN and engine emissions is complicated
by many factors including the technology level of the engine, with
older, lower injection pressure engines generally being more
sensitive to CN. Despite the inherently relatively high CNs of fatty
compounds, NOx exhaust emissions usually increase slightly when
operating a diesel engine on biodiesel [245]. The level of exhaust
emissions is also proportional to the amount of biodiesel in blends
thereof with petrodiesel [245]. The connection between the struc-
ture of fatty esters and exhaust emissions was investigated [246,247]
by studying the exhaust emissions caused by enriched fatty acid alkyl
esters (FAAE) as fuel. NOx exhaust emissions increase with increas-
ing unsaturation and decreasing chain length, which can also lead
to a connection with the CNs of these compounds. While several
fuel properties play a role in affecting the NOx increase when using
biodiesel as fuel, the key factors appear to be charge-gas mixtures
that are closer to stoichiometric at ignition and in the standing pre-
mixed autoignition zone near the flame lift-off length [248]. Other
properties, notably (isentropic) bulk modulus and speed of sound,
have been considered among the primary influencing factors due
to their effect on the fuel injection system and combustion, ulti-
mately elevating NOx exhaust emissions [229,244–248]. Speed of
sound, which decreases with increasing temperature, and isen-
tropic bulk modulus tend to increase as the degree of unsaturation
and chain length increase with the increase in isentropic bulk
modulus being fairly uniform with the addition of each double bond
(Table 6) [249–254]. The higher viscosity, higher cetane number, and

lower volatility of the biodiesel combine with the earlier injection
timing to effect the start of combustion. Also, the higher bulk
modulus of biodiesel compared to petrodiesel implies that bio-
diesel experiences a faster pressure rise than petrodiesel, resulting
in earlier injection for biodiesel [251,252].

Particulate emissions, on the other hand, were hardly influ-
enced by the aforementioned structural factors. Compared to neat
alkanes, the “ideal” components of petrodiesel, biodiesel and its com-
ponents lower PM exhaust emissions considerably while neat alkanes
show lower NOx exhaust emissions than biodiesel and its neat com-
ponents [247]. Neat alkanes also exhibited lower PM and NOx exhaust
emissions than the petrodiesel fuel they were compared to [248],
showing that components such as aromatics in petrodiesel fuel are
likely responsible to a significant extent for its regulated exhaust
emissions. This observation implies that the results of exhaust emis-
sions testing of biodiesel vs petrodiesel depend on both fuels, also
considering that petrodiesel has undergone changes over the years
such as the introduction of ultra-low sulfur diesel fuels. Exhaust
emissions control technologies, however, such as selective cata-
lytic reduction (SCR; serving to reduce NOx exhaust emissions) and
diesel particulate filters (DPF; serving to reduce particulate emis-
sions) which are increasingly penetrating the diesel engine market
as older engines are retired have the effect of largely eliminating
the effect of compound structure on exhaust emissions as they leave
the tailpipe of a vehicle [255].

Another aspect of exhaust emissions is that of their effect on
human health. In the United States, soy-derived biodiesel passed
EPA Tier 2 Health effects testing required for registration under pro-
visions of the Clean Air Act in the United States [256]. Generally,
biodiesel and petrodiesel generate the same types of exhaust emis-
sions but the detailed composition and morphology of the species
in the exhaust emissions may differ, an effect also dependent on the
engine and the conditions of the test. This holds for the particu-
late matter and hydrocarbons exhaust emissions addressed by
regulations. Issues that have been investigated include mutagen-
icity and cytotoxicity with several reviews being available [257–259].
For example, despite overall lower particulate matter emissions, bio-
diesel generated smaller particles which are of concern because they
can penetrate deeper into the lungs. Exhaust emissions control
systems, however, may have significant effect on the remaining par-
ticles emitted. Aldehydes and alkanes, identified as ozone precursors,
were increased in exhaust emissions from rapeseed methyl esters
[260]. Emissions generated by rapeseed methyl esters had higher
toxicity but mutagenicity was reduced by biodiesel, probably due
to higher polyaromatic hydrocarbons in the case of petrodiesel
[261,262], although newer “clean” petrodiesel fuels also perform
better in this respect. Relatedly, both biodiesel and renewable diesel
were found to be preferable to conventional petrodiesel for use in
underground mining equipment [263]. Overall, the effect of bio-
diesel versus petrodiesel is mixed, being complicated by constantly
evolving levels of engine and exhaust emissions control technolo-
gy which may level the effects of fuel composition, varying fuel
composition as well as the conditions of engines tests including geo-
graphical and meteorological conditions, so that the need for more
research exists [259,264].

The suitability of fatty acid alkyl esters as petrodiesel alterna-
tive is also indicated by the heat of combustion. The heats of
combustion of virtually all fatty acid methyl esters occurring in bio-
diesel exceed 35,000 kJ/kg (35 MJ/kg), the minimum heat of
combustion value prescribed in the European standard EN 14213
[265] when using biodiesel for heating purposes. Heat of combus-
tion of a compound generally increases with chain length and
increasing saturation. Some experimental [266] and calculated [243]
values for heat of combustion are given in Table 7. For comparison
purposes, an experimental value for the heat of combustion of
hexadecane is 47,180 kJ/kg [266]. Thus, the lower heat of combustion

of biodiesel compared to petrodiesel causes slightly elevated fuel
consumption which is partially compensated by the higher density
of biodiesel, leading to a minor decrease when in terms of volume
for commercial applications. It may be noted that heat of combus-
tion is not included in the biodiesel standards ASTM D6751 and EN
14214.

2.5.3. Cold flow

Poor low-temperature flow properties are a major problem
associated with the use of biodiesel and affect biodiesel both in its
neat form and in blends with petrodiesel. Major operability prob-
lems are caused by solids and crystals rapidly growing and
agglomerating, plugging fuel lines and filters. This issue is docu-
mented by many biodiesel fuels exhibiting a relatively high cloud
point (CP; ASTM D2500 [267]) and pour point (PP; ASTM D97 [268]).
For example, the CP of methyl soyate was given as 0 °C [82] and that
of palm oil methyl esters, which contain high amounts of satu-
rated fatty acids, as 16 °C [269]. The CP usually occurs at a higher
temperature than the PP. The CP is the temperature at which a fatty
material becomes cloudy due to the formation of crystals and so-
lidification of saturates. When the temperature decreases further,
even more solids form and the material approaches the PP, the lowest
temperature at which it will still flow. Saturated fatty compounds
have significantly higher melting points than unsaturated fatty
compounds (Table 8; for a compilation of melting points of fatty acid

moieties in these additives would destroy the harmony of the
crystallizing solids. The effect of some additives appears to be limited,
however, because they more strongly affect the PP than the CP or
they had only a slight influence on CP.

The use of branched esters such as iso-propyl, iso-butyl and 2-butyl
instead of methyl esters [195,282], based on their lower melting points
compared to methyl esters (Table 8), is another approach for im-
proving the low-temperature properties of biodiesel. Branched esters
exhibit a lower TCO (crystallization onset temperature) as deter-
mined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) for the isopropyl
esters of SBO by 7–11 °C and for the 2-butyl esters of SBO by 12–
14 °C [282]. CP and PP are also lowered by branched esters. The CP
of iso-propyl soyate was given as −9 °C and that of 2-butyl soyate as
−12 °C [195], comparing favorably with the CP of methyl soyate men-
tioned above. Only iso-propyl esters appear attractive as branched-
chain esters under economic aspects, although they are even more
expensive than methyl esters. Branching in the alcohol moiety of
the ester functionality does not negatively affect the CNs of these
compounds as discussed above. The approach of using esters other
than methyl is of interest for “designer” biodiesel, i.e., optimizing
the composition of biodiesel to improve properties, as discussed in
the corresponding section below. A variation of this approach is the
use of esters with branching in the fatty acid chain, for example methyl
iso-oleate and methyl iso-stearate isomers, which improved the CP
and PP of biodiesel fuels significantly at higher concentrations [283].
The effect of branching in the fatty acid chain is shown by the sig-
nificantly lower melting point (>10 °C difference) of methyl iso-
stearate compared to methyl stearate (Table 8).

Winterization [284,285] is based on the lower melting points of
unsaturated fatty compounds vs. saturated compounds. This method
removes by filtration solids, mainly saturated esters, formed during
cooling of the plant oil esters, leaving a mixture enriched in un-
saturated fatty esters and thus lower CP and PP. Repetition of this
procedure further reduces CP and PP. Since saturated fatty acid alkyl
esters also have higher CNs than their unsaturated counterparts as
discussed above, winterization simultaneously decreases the CN of
biodiesel while improving low-temperature properties. The removal
of the saturated species also caused loss of unsaturated esters oc-
cluded in the solid material. Less material is lost when winterization
is conducted in the presence of cold flow improvers or solvents such
as hexane and iso-propanol [285].

Besides the saturated esters, minor constituents of biodiesel can
also cause significant cold flow problems [286–292]. These minor
components (may) have greater influence on cold flow of bio-
diesel than their amounts indicate. Among the most problematic
species are monoacylglycerols (MAG), especially those of satu-
rated fatty acids, formed as intermediates in the transesterification
reaction, and steryl glucosides. This also affects low-level blends of
biodiesel with petrodiesel with an increase of 0.01 wt.% saturated
MAG in a biodiesel blend increasing CP by as much as 4 °C [292].
The high melting points of saturated monoacylglycerols (melting
points of monopalmitin and monostearin >70 °C), which can pre-
cipitate in biodiesel in different crystal forms with different solubility
[290], and free steryl glucosides (m.p. >240 °C) cause these mate-
rials to crystallize from biodiesel more readily under common storage
conditions [287,289]. Steryl glucosides occur naturally in acylated
form in plant oils and consist of a sterol and a carbohydrate (glucose)
moiety [287,289]. The acylated form in which they occur naturally
can be changed to the less-soluble free form during biodiesel pro-
duction by the transesterification reaction.

Algae-derived biodiesel fuels, besides their often elevated content
of high-melting saturated esters, may contain other components af-
fecting cold flow as was shown for a biodiesel fuel derived from
Isochrysis [293]. These materials are long-chain alkenones (usually
C37 and C38) with a keto group located at one end of the molecule
and unsaturation at different positions in the chain and whose

esters, see also [270]), and therefore in a mixture they crystallize
at higher temperature than their unsaturated counterparts. The CP
depends on the nature and amounts of the saturated fatty com-
pounds [271]. Thus, biodiesel fuels derived from fats or oils with
significant amounts of saturated fatty compounds will display
higher CPs and PPs. Generally, the CP is more critical than the PP
for improving low-temperature flow properties [272]. In Fig. 3, CP
point data are compiled for the methyl esters of various oils which
show the dependence of the cloud point or, more generally speak-
ing, cold flow properties on the nature and amount of saturated fatty
acid methyl esters.

Besides CP and PP, two other test methods for assessing the
cold flow properties of petrodiesel are the low-temperature flow
test (LTFT; used in North America; ASTM D4539 [273]) and cold
filter plugging point (CFPP; used outside North America; see the
European standard EN 116 [274]). Biodiesel and its blends with
petrodiesel have been evaluated by these methods. Such low-
temperature filterability tests have been stated to correlate better
with operability tests than CP or PP [275]. For fuel formulations con-
taining at least 10 vol.−% methyl esters, however, LTFT and CFPP are
linear functions of CP [276]. More recently, the cold soak filterabil-
ity test (CSFT; ASTM D7501 [277]) was developed which determines
the filtration time through a specific filter of biodiesel stored at 4.5 °C
and then warmed to 25 °C. An overview of these and other test
methods is available in the literature [278].

Approaches investigated for improving the low-temperature prob-
lems of the mixtures of fatty acid methyl esters that are biodiesel
include blending with petrodiesel, winterization, additives, esters
with branching in the alcohol moiety or fatty acid chain, and bulky
substituents in the chain. Blending of esters with petrodiesel is not
discussed here.

Numerous additives, usually of polymeric nature, have been re-
ported, mainly in patent literature, to lower PP or sometimes even
CP. A brief overview of such additives has been provided in the lit-
erature [279]. Relatedly, the use of fatty compound-derived materials
with bulky moieties in the chain at additive levels was investi-
gated [280,281]. The background of this approach is that the bulky

melting point is around 70 °C. Removal of these alkenones im-
proves the cold flow properties, although oxidative stability remains
an issue due to the high content of polyunsaturated fatty esters [293].

2.5.4. Oxidative stability

Besides cold flow, oxidative stability of biodiesel is a subject of
considerable interest research as it is also one of the major tech-
nical issues facing biodiesel. Some review articles on various aspects
of biodiesel oxidative and storage stability are [294–297]. The issue
of oxidation affects biodiesel primarily during extended storage.

Besides oxidation, it should be noted that other stability-
related issues regarding biodiesel exist. These issues include stability
toward water and microbial growth. For example, the saturation level
of moisture in biodiesel is 15–25 times higher than that of petrodiesel
in the temperature range of 4–35 °C [298]. This proclivity to take
up moisture may promote the hydrolysis of biodiesel to fatty acids,
besides the aspect of moisture enhancing oxidation and microbial
growth [299,300].

The influence of parameters such as the presence of air, heat,
light, traces of metal, antioxidants, and peroxides as well as the
nature of the storage container was investigated in the aforemen-
tioned studies. Generally, factors such as the presence of air and/
or light, elevated temperatures, the presence of metals or exposure
to light facilitate oxidation. Studies performed with the auto-
mated oil stability index (OSI) method confirmed the catalyzing effect
of metals on oxidation, with copper being among the most effec-
tive oxidation-promoting metals [301]. The influence of compound
structure of the fatty esters, especially unsaturation as discussed
below, was even greater [296].

Biodiesel standards call for evaluating oxidative stability with
the so-called Rancimat method. During this procedure, air is bubbled
through the sample at an elevated temperature (110 °C) and the ef-
fluent directed into water, the conductivity of which is continuously
measured. The time of the greatest increase in the conductivity of
the water is given as the induction time. Originally, the standard
EN 14112 [302] using this method was developed for studying neat
FAME. A modified version with reduced sample volatility, EN 15751
[303], was more recently developed for investigating blends of bio-
diesel with petrodiesel. The biodiesel standards ASTM D6751 and
EN 14214 call for minimum oxidative stability times (induction
times) of 3 h and 8 h, respectively. Numerous other methods such
as DSC, but also including wet chemical procedures such as acid value
and peroxide value, have been applied in oxidation studies of bio-
diesel. Despite addressing the issue of oxidation through
determination of initial degradation products, the peroxide value,
however, is not very suitable assessing the oxidation status of bio-
diesel. The reason is the formation of secondary oxidation products
so that the peroxide value may decrease even in case of progress-
ing oxidative degradation [304]. Another specification in EN 14214
purported to address the oxidation stability issue is the iodine value
(IV), which is a measure of total unsaturation of a sample. The IV,
however, is not suitable for this purpose because it is too unspe-
cific as, for example, an infinite number of fatty acid profiles yield
the same IV [305].

The presence of double bonds in the chains of many fatty com-
pounds is the reason for their autoxidation. The autoxidation of
unsaturated fatty compounds proceeds with different rates de-
pending on the number and position of double bonds [306]. The
positions allylic to double bonds are especially susceptible to oxi-
dation. The bis-allylic positions in common polyunsaturated fatty
acids such as linoleic acid (double bonds at C-9 and C-12, thus one
bis-allylic position at C-11) and linolenic acid (double bonds at C-9,
C-12, and C-15, thus two bis-allylic positions at C-11 and C-14) are
even more prone to autoxidation than allylic positions. Relative rates
of oxidation given in the literature [306] are 1 for oleates (methyl,
ethyl esters), 41 for linoleates, and 98 for linolenates. This is essential

because most biodiesel fuels from plant oils contain significant
amounts of esters of oleic, linoleic, or linolenic acids, which influ-
ence the oxidative stability of the fuels. Many algal oils contain even
more highly unsaturated fatty acids with four, five or even six double
bonds, usually of C20 and C22 chain lengths. These materials cause
biodiesel from algal oils to be very susceptible to oxidation.

Oxidation is a very complex process causing the fuel to even-
tually deteriorate. The oxidation process begins with the formation
of hydroperoxides with subsequent secondary reactions leading to
a variety of products, including aldehydes, carboxylic acids, hydro-
carbons, ketones, polymers and others [306], the discussion of which
is beyond the scope of this article. It may be noted that other sta-
bility issues such as hydrolytic stability may affect the other major
functional group in fatty acid alkyl esters, namely the ester moiety,
through saponification.

Oxidation stability (induction times) determined for neat fatty
acid esters using the Rancimat method is given in Table 9. As the
data show, no neat unsaturated fatty acid methyl ester exhibits an
induction time >3 h, which is the minimum specification in the ASTM
biodiesel standard. This observation indicates that antioxidant ad-
ditives are almost always necessary to attain the minimum oxidative
stability specifications in biodiesel standards. Another issue in this
respect is that, similar to the issue of cold flow, the presence of minor
amounts of unsaturated fatty acid chains may have a greater in-
fluence on oxidative stability than their amounts indicate. Also,
vegetable oils have naturally occurring tocopherols and their pres-
ence (or absence) may have a significant effect on the oxidation
stability of biodiesel [307].

2.5.5. Lubricity

The issue of diesel fuel lubricity attained increasing signifi-
cance with the advent of low-sulfur petrodiesel. The background
is that hydrodesulfurization of petrodiesel reduces or eliminates the
inherent lubricity of this fuel [308–311], which is essential for proper
functioning of vital engine components such as fuel pumps and in-
jectors. Hydrodesulfurization reduces not only the sulfur content
of diesel fuel but also removes oxygen- and nitrogen-containing com-
pounds which were responsible for its inherent lubricity [311,312].
The effect of heteroatoms on lubricity was confirmed by an inves-
tigation of neat C3 compounds with OH, NH2, and SH groups leading
to the sequence of lubricity improvement OH > NH2 > SH [313].

The commonly applied procedure for lubricity testing of
petrodiesel and biodiesel is the high-frequency reciprocating rig
(HFRR) in which a vibrator arm holding a steel ball slides back and
forth over a steel disk immersed in the sample to be tested as de-
scribed in standards such as ASTM D6079 [314] or ISO 12156 [315].
During this test, wear scars are generated on both the steel ball and
disk. The dimensions of the wear scars are proportional to the lu-
bricating properties of the sample, with smaller wear scars indicating
better lubricating properties. The wear scar on the ball is used for
assessing the lubricating properties of the sample. The wear scar
on the disk is also suitable, however, with the advantages of easier
handling of the disk and a more recognizable wear scar [316].

Lubricity has not been included in biodiesel standards despite
the favorable behavior of biodiesel vs. petrodiesel with respect to
this fuel property. Thus the maximum wear scars prescribed in
petrodiesel standards are used as guidelines for lubricity im-
parted by biodiesel. These maximum wear scars are 520 μm in the
American petrodiesel standard ASTM D975 [17] and 460 μm in the
European petrodiesel standard EN 590 [233]. The maximum values
are averages of the major and minor axes of the wear scar on the
ball assessed using a metallurgical microscope.

Numerous studies on the lubricity of biodiesel or fatty com-
pounds have shown the beneficial effect of these materials on the
lubricity of petrodiesel, particularly low-sulfur petrodiesel fuel
with poor lubricity. An advantage of biodiesel compared to lubricity-
enhancing additives is that biodiesel inherently possesses fuel
properties competitive and compatible with petrodiesel, which
those additives usually do not possess. Thus, adding biodiesel at
low levels (1–2%) restores the lubricity to low-sulfur petrodiesel.
On the other hand, neat free fatty acids, monoacylglycerols,
and glycerol possess better lubricity than neat esters [313,317]
because of their free OH groups as OH groups also enhance
lubricity in fatty acid chains [313,318], with lubricity also improv-
ing slightly with chain length and the presence of double bonds.
Overall, an order of oxygenated moieties enhancing lubricity
(COOH > CHO > OH > COOCH3 > C=O > C—O—C) was obtained from
studying various oxygenated C10 compounds [313]. This sequence
resembles those established for other physical properties such as
melting point, boiling point, viscosity, etc.

Adding commercial biodiesel at low levels improves the lubric-
ity of low-sulfur petrodiesel more than the addition of neat fatty
esters. This indicates that biodiesel components other than methyl
esters are largely responsible for improving the lubricity of low-
level blends of biodiesel in petrodiesel. Thus, some materials, namely
free fatty acids and monoacylglycerols, usually considered unde-
sirable constituents because of their impairment of low-temperature
or other properties of biodiesel, are largely responsible for the lu-
bricity of low-level blends of biodiesel in (ultra-)low-sulfur
petrodiesel [313]. Table 10 contains some results on the lubricity
of biodiesel with the aforementioned HFRR test, underscoring the
effects discussed here. Thus, commercial biodiesel is required at a
level of 1–2% in low-lubricity petrodiesel, which exceeds the typical
additive level, to attain the lubricity-imparting additive level of bio-
diesel contaminants in petrodiesel.

The above results are underscored by other studies [319,320] dis-
cussing the lubricity-enhancing effects of minor components of
biodiesel. While all studies agree on the effect of the minor compo-
nents, the order of reported effectiveness varies from study to study.
It was stated [317] that methyl esters and monoacylglycerols mainly
affect lubricity while free fatty acids and diacylglycerols have less effect.
On the other hand, a sequence of lubricity enhancement FFA > soy
biodiesel > phospholipids > antioxidant > glycerol > distilled soy bio-
diesel > individual FAME was established [320], although it is not clear
why glycerol should enhance lubricity more than individual fatty acid
methyl esters because of the poor solubility of glycerol in petrodiesel
[313]. Also, phospholipids are generally not observed as biodiesel com-
ponents. Furthermore, moisture in biodiesel negatively affects its
lubricity [321], an issue related to the increased tendency of bio-
diesel to take up water as discussed above. Therefore, care needs to
be taken to avoid this issue.

Thus, although in contrast to oxidative stability and cold flow
lubricity is not a problematic issue with biodiesel, it resembles those
issues in the aspect of minor components having more influence
than their minor amounts indicate.

the first-named material. This mixture was then added to the petrodiesel fuel. Thus,
the second- and third-named materials are present at 0.01% (100 ppm) levels in the
petrodiesel fuel.

the existence of this specification is likely to have another factor
distinguishing biodiesel from the parent oil and to exclude some
biodiesel fuels containing significant amounts of polyunsaturated
fatty esters.

Density increases with increasing unsaturation and content of
heavier atoms. Density values of some neat fatty acid alkyl esters
are given in Table 11. Similar to CN and viscosity it is possible to

2.5.7. Fuel properties of some biodiesel fuels: “Designer” biodiesel,
feedstock optimization and fuel property improvement

The various fuel properties (except solvent properties, of course)
discussed above largely for individual fatty acid methyl esters can
be applied to assess the properties of the mixtures that comprise
biodiesel from different feedstocks and to formulate what can be

termed “designer” biodiesel, i.e., a fuel with optimized fatty acid
composition. Table 12 lists the fatty acid profiles and properties of
some selected biodiesel fuels. The biodiesel fuels listed there are
derived from a variety of feedstocks, including plant oils with dif-
fering fatty acid profiles and also algae. Note that the fatty acid
profiles of algae usually contain elevated amounts of myristic and
palmitic acids, leading to problematic cold flow properties, as well
as elevated amounts of highly polyunsaturated fatty acids, leading
to reduced oxidative stability.

A review of data in Table 12 underscores the effect of the indi-
vidual fatty acid methyl esters on the overall properties of biodiesel
fuels from different feedstocks. These effects include, as discussed

52

above, the presence of high-melting saturated FAMEs increasing
cloud point and polyunsaturated FAMEs decreasing oxidative stability.
Beyond the above evaluations, the information on properties of
individual fatty acid alkyl esters can be used to formulate what can
be termed “designer” biodiesel, i.e., a fuel with optimized fatty acid
composition [243,323]. Five approaches exist for improving overall
biodiesel fuel properties [323]. These approaches are (a) the use of
additives, (b) the use of esters other than methyl, and changing the
fatty acid profile by (c) either physical procedures, (d) genetic mod-
ification, or (e) utilizing feedstocks with inherently different fatty
acid profiles. Regarding approach (b), the properties of esters other
than methyl are given in Table 13. The data in Table 13 show that
the major advantage is the reduced melting point of these esters
(also see discussion above on cold flow properties) compared to
methyl esters while the other properties remain similar or, at least,
within biodiesel standard specifications. An approach based on
blending of feedstocks and neat methyl esters to achieve a desired
fatty acid profiles has been discussed taking into account the fuel
properties [324] as well as economic and political considerations
[325]. Engine tests have been conducted to test the concept of im-
proving fuel performance through blending [326,327]. Some
properties improved and some showed negative effects which sug-
gests that the overall “desirability” of a fuel may indeed need to be
determined by assigning weights to different aspects of perfor-
mance, economic and social impact. Algae can be modified to
increase lipid production [328,329] and the fatty acid profile of algae
can apparently be tailored depending on various parameters em-
ployed for their cultivation. Microbiological approaches to biodiesel
fuels with modified fatty ester profiles have been reported that do
not use classical lipid feedstocks, using carbohydrates instead
[330–334].

Relating to the approaches (d) and (e), oleic acid enrichment with
linoleic acid as the secondary fatty acid was suggested with the ad-
ditional aspect that such a fatty acid composition has useful
organoleptic properties [335]. An overall evaluation of the proper-
ties suggests that, when using methyl esters, methyl palmitoleate
or methyl decanoate would be compounds to target for enrich-
ment in biodiesel [243]. Accordingly, an oil moderately enriched in
palmitoleic acid, macadamia nut oil, was investigated for its fuel
properties but the moderate level of palmitoleic acid and the pres-
ence of some high-melting C20 and C22 esters led to properties
typical for biodiesel from other oils [336]. Biodiesel derived from
a variety of cuphea oil highly enriched in decanoic acid (approxi-
mately 65%) possesses improved properties including a low CP of
−9 to −10 °C [102], besides showing a distillation curve resem-
bling more closely that of petrodiesel than that of biodiesel derived
from vegetable oils [337,338]. The genetic engineering of crops to
enrich medium-chain fatty acids such as decanoic acid in oils has
been discussed [339]. Additionally, biodiesel from field penny-
cress oil with a fatty acid profile consisting mainly of erucic acid
and C18:1 unsaturated fatty acids also exhibited a lower CP of −10 °C
[105].

2.5.8. Solvent properties of fatty acid alkyl esters

Besides application as fuel, solvent use is probably the most
common use of biodiesel (fatty acid alkyl esters). As indicated above,
early documentation of this was the utilization of biodiesel as agent
for shoreline remediation after petroleum spills [27,28]. Biodiesel
is sold as solvent as it has been employed for various cleaning and
degreasing purposes [340]. The solvent use of fatty acid alkyl esters
also takes advantage of the high flash point of biodiesel and its low
levels of volatile organic compounds (VOC). Other applications of
biodiesel in the area of solvents include use as a polymerization
solvent [341,342] and as alternative for organic solvents in liquid–
liquid extraction [343,344] but a detailed discussion of these is
beyond the scope of this article. While the use of biodiesel as solvent

may appear somewhat removed from a discussion on fuel (and lu-
bricant) use such as the present one, it may be noted that, according
to numerous anecdotal reports, the solvent properties of biodiesel
have caused sediments or sludge formed in fuel tanks by petrodiesel
to (partially) dissolve and move down the fuel line, causing prob-
lems similar to poor cold flow. This issue has not been investigated
in the literature so it remains largely anecdotal but appears worthy
of study in connection with solvent properties.

have been shown to correlate directly with the fatty acid profile,
and thus the source feedstock. With this knowledge, pathways
toward improved biodiesel fuel compositions have been elucidated.

a Hansen solubility parameters are the mean of two approaches described in Ref.

[339].

b Not determined.

The Kauri-butanol (KB) value is a descriptor for solvent strength
with a higher KB value indicating stronger solvency. A standard
method for determining the KB value is ASTM D1133 [345] in which
the sample is “titrated’ with KB solution until it becomes turbid.
While the KB value of straight-chain hydrocarbons is in the range
from approximately 25 to low 30s decreasing with chain length, the
KB value of neat fatty acid methyl esters increases from C1 to C4/
C5 and then decreases with increasing chain length [346]. The KB
values of free fatty acids, octanoic acid and oleic acid were found
to be significantly higher [346]. The KB value of soybean methyl
esters was determined as 59.6 [346], coinciding with a previous
report of around 58 [340]. Vegetable oils, on the other hand, appear
to have low KB values, for example, the KB value of neat soybean
oil has been given as 19.1 [346]. Some KB values as determined in
the literature are given in Table 14.

Hansen solubility parameters (HSPs) [348] are more elaborate
and reliable predictors of solubility but a discussion of which is
beyond the scope of this article. Briefly, the HSPs are used to predict
if one material will dissolve another and form a solution. For the
prediction, each material possesses three Hansen parameters and
the closer these parameters are for two given materials, the more
likely they will form a solution. The three HSP parameters are δd
(energy from dispersion forces between molecules), δp (energy from
dipolar intermolecular force between molecules) and δh (energy from
hydrogen bonds between molecules). HSPs can be applied to neat
individual compounds as well as to mixtures and innumerable other
materials, including of biological or other nature. The HSPs of methyl
soyate [347,349,350] and some other vegetable oil esters as well as
individual fatty acid methyl esters [347,349] have been reported.
Recent literature data for HSPs of for some vegetable oil esters and
individual fatty acid methyl esters [347,350] are also listed in Table 14.

3. Summary

Significant research progress has been made in recent years
regarding plant oil alkyl esters, commonly referred to as biodiesel.
It has come to be accepted as an environmentally friendly fuel al-
ternative and it is now used in blends with petrodiesel in many
countries. Numerous feedstocks have been studied and several have
been developed for commercial use. To potentially improve process
efficiency, many variations of biodiesel production have been in-
vestigated, although the “conventional” process preferably using
alkoxide (methoxide) remains well-established. Most fuel properties
