    "question_text": "What is the physical significance of the Q-terms in the strongly stretched flamelet equations, and under what combustion conditions do they become non-negligible?",
    "standard_answer": "The Q-terms in the strongly stretched flamelet equations represent transport processes along flame surfaces due to gradients of scalar quantities (enthalpy, species mass fractions, element mass fractions) tangential to the flame front. Physically, they account for conduction/diffusion parallel to the flame surfaces when local iso-surfaces of these scalars are not aligned with the progress variable iso-surfaces. These terms become significant when: (1) the flame is partially premixed, creating mixture fraction gradients along flame surfaces; (2) heat loss mechanisms create enthalpy gradients along flame surfaces (e.g., flame stabilization near burners); or (3) when the characteristic length scale of tangential gradients becomes comparable to or smaller than the flame thickness (∇_tZ_j ~ 1/δ_f). In fully premixed adiabatic flames, Q-terms are typically negligible compared to stretch and reaction terms, but in stratified flames or flames with strong heat loss, the scalar dissipation rate along flame surfaces makes Q-terms physically important for accurate flame structure prediction.",
    "original_text": {
      "1": "The Q-terms in Eq. (29) describe conduction/diffusion along the flame surfaces and are presumably small.",
      "2": "When the typical length scale of the gradient is comparable to or smaller than the flame thickness (e.g., ∇_tZ_j ~ 1/δ_f), then the Q-term cannot be neglected."

    "question_text": "Derive the relationship between the mass burning rate m_b^0 of a stretchless flame and the integrated reaction-diffusion balance using the integral analysis method, explaining the physical interpretation of each term in the final expression.",
    "standard_answer": "The derivation begins with the progress variable equation in flame-adapted coordinates: ∂/∂s(σmY) - ∂/∂s(σ(λ/(c_pLe_Y))∂Y/∂s) = σω_Y. Multiplying by the diffusion term D(s) = σ(λ/(c_pLe_Y))∂Y/∂s and integrating from unburnt (s_u) to burnt (s_b) eliminates the diffusion term since fluxes vanish at boundaries. This yields ∫(A(s)D(s))ds = ∫(D(s)S(s))ds, where A(s) = ∂/∂s(σmY) and S(s) = σω_Y. For thin reaction layers, D(s) in the preheat zone approximates to ∫A(ψ)dψ from s_u to s. Substituting and evaluating integrals gives: (1/2)[σ_b m_b^0(Y_b^0 - Y_u)]^2 ≈ ∫[σ^2(λ/(c_pLe_Y))ω_Y]dY from Y_u to Y_b^0. Solving for m_b^0 yields: m_b^0 ≈ [1/(Y_b^0 - Y_u)]√[2∫(σ^2/σ_b^2)(λ/(c_pLe_Y))ω_Y dY]. Physically, the square root term represents the total Y production in the reaction layer diffusing into the preheat zone, while the denominator (Y_b^0 - Y_u) represents the convective transport needed to balance this diffusion flux, thus determining the mass burning rate.",

    "question_text": "How does the flame-adapted coordinate system enable resolution of strong stretch effects in turbulent premixed flames, and what advantages does this provide over weak stretch theories?",
    "standard_answer": "The flame-adapted coordinate system resolves strong stretch effects by transforming the governing equations to a curvilinear system where coordinate surfaces align with progress variable iso-contours and coordinate lines follow flamelet paths orthogonal to these surfaces. This transformation allows explicit resolution of stretch rate K(s) and area element σ(s) variations throughout the flame thickness, rather than assuming homogeneous perturbations as in weak stretch theories. The key advantages are: (1) ability to handle Karlovitz numbers Ka ~ 1 where turbulent eddies are comparable to flame thickness (η ~ δ_f), (2) incorporation of realistic multi-species transport and chemistry without large activation energy assumptions, (3) resolution of curvature effects throughout the diffusive layer, and (4) accurate prediction of local mass burning rate variations due to stretch and preferential diffusion. Weak stretch theories assume perturbations are homogeneous on flame scales (η >> δ_f) and are limited to single-step chemistry with large activation energy, making them unreliable for practical turbulent combustion where small-scale turbulence directly interacts with flame structure.",

      "1": "The main difference between the existing weak stretch theories and our strong stretch theory is that we will not assume that δ_f→0 thus we cannot treat the flame as an interface as in other models.",

    "question_text": "How does the mass-based flame stretch rate K account for changes in flame thickness and density in the strong stretch theory, and what physical mechanisms differentiate it from the traditional area-based stretch rate Kσ?",
    "standard_answer": "The mass-based flame stretch rate K incorporates two additional physical mechanisms beyond the traditional area-based stretch rate Kσ: (1) changes in flame thickness through the term (1/h₁)(∂h₁/∂τ), representing the fractional rate of change of the local flame thickness along flamelet paths, and (2) density variations through (1/ρ)(∂ρ/∂τ), representing the fractional rate of change of density for fluid parcels moving with the flame. These terms arise because the strong stretch theory resolves the finite thickness of the diffusive layer rather than treating the flame as an infinitesimally thin interface. The traditional Kσ only considers area changes due to flow straining and flame motion, while K additionally captures how local flame structure modifications (thickness changes) and thermodynamic state variations (density changes) affect mass conservation along flamelet paths. This comprehensive approach enables accurate modeling in regimes where turbulent eddies are comparable to flame thickness (η ~ δ_f), where weak stretch theories fail.",

    "standard_answer": "The paper identifies that preferential diffusion phenomena can have a significant impact on flame structure and dynamics, particularly when hydrogen enrichment is involved. These effects arise from differences in molecular diffusion rates between species, which can alter local mixture compositions and flame behavior. In turbulent flames with strong preferential diffusion effects, the FGM approach addresses these challenges by incorporating an additional control variable specifically designed to capture changes in element mass fractions and enthalpy. This computational strategy allows the model to efficiently account for the variations caused by differential diffusion without requiring full resolution of all chemical species transport equations. The inclusion of this single additional control variable enables the FGM model to maintain accuracy while significantly reducing computational cost, making it suitable for practical combustion simulations where preferential diffusion plays an important role in flame dynamics and stability.",
