    "question_text": "Based on the provided paper content, explain how the steam-to-carbon (S/C) ratio affects carbon deposition in steam reforming of hydrocarbons, focusing specifically on the thermodynamic mechanisms described. Include the specific carbon formation reactions mentioned in the paper and discuss how steam helps prevent carbon formation through thermodynamic equilibrium shifting. Your explanation must be supported by direct evidence from the paper citations.",
    "standard_answer": "The steam-to-carbon (S/C) ratio plays a crucial role in mitigating carbon deposition during hydrocarbon steam reforming primarily through thermodynamic mechanisms. According to the paper, carbon deposition occurs mainly through two pathways: 'Carbon can be formed mainly either through a strongly endothermic hydrocarbon thermal decomposition reaction: CnHm → nCsolid + (m/2)H2 or through associations and polymerization of olefins.' The paper emphasizes that 'Carbon deposition is probably the most important concern that needs to be addressed in all catalytic techniques employed in hydrocarbon and oxygenate fuel reforming, including oxidative reforming.' This phenomenon is particularly relevant when processing heavy fuels since 'thermal cracking reactions can easily occur at relatively low temperatures and the formed byproducts (mainly olefins) can induce the formation of carbonaceous deposits.' Higher S/C ratios thermodynamically suppress carbon formation by increasing the steam partial pressure, which shifts the equilibrium away from carbon-forming reactions toward gasification products. The increased steam concentration makes carbon formation less favorable thermodynamically by providing excess reactants that drive the system toward complete reforming rather than decomposition pathways. While the paper discusses these fundamental thermodynamic mechanisms, it does not provide specific S/C ratio thresholds for different fuels, instead focusing on the general principle that sufficient steam is necessary to thermodynamically suppress carbon formation pathways.",
