    "question_text": "Calculate the energy efficiency of a tyre pyrolysis process producing TPO, given a tyre feedstock lower heating value (LHV) of 35 MJ/kg and TPO yield of 45% with LHV of 42 MJ/kg, considering only the liquid product energy output.",
    "standard_answer": "The energy efficiency based on TPO output is calculated as the ratio of energy in TPO to energy in the tyre feedstock. For 1 kg of tyre feedstock: Energy input = 35 MJ. TPO mass produced = 0.45 kg. Energy in TPO = 0.45 kg × 42 MJ/kg = 18.9 MJ. Energy efficiency = (18.9 MJ / 35 MJ) × 100% = 54%. This calculation assumes no energy recovery from gaseous or solid fractions, which would improve overall efficiency. In practice, pyrolysis processes often utilize gaseous products to power the reactor, achieving energy self-sustainability. The high LHV of TPO (42 MJ/kg) compared to diesel (∼45 MJ/kg) makes it a viable fuel, but the 54% efficiency highlights the importance of optimizing yield and leveraging by-products for comprehensive energy balance.",

      "1": "Pyrolysis process efficiency is high and feedstock for TPO is both available and flexible.",

    "question_text": "How does pyrolysis temperature affect the yield and composition of tyre pyrolysis oil (TPO), and what are the underlying chemical mechanisms driving these changes?",
    "standard_answer": "Pyrolysis temperature critically influences TPO yield through competing decomposition and cracking mechanisms. At lower temperatures (300-400°C), primary pyrolysis dominates, breaking weaker bonds in rubber polymers like natural rubber (NR) and styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) to produce volatile hydrocarbons, maximizing liquid yield. As temperature increases to 500-600°C, secondary cracking becomes significant: longer hydrocarbon chains crack into lighter fractions, increasing gas yield at the expense of TPO. Specifically, alkenes and cycloalkenes formed during initial decomposition undergo Diels-Alder reactions and aromatization, converting to benzene derivatives and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Above 600°C, extensive cracking reduces TPO yield further while increasing gas production and PAH content due to enhanced ring-opening and recyclization reactions. The optimal TPO yield typically peaks around 500°C, balancing primary decomposition and minimizing secondary cracking.",
    "original_text": {
      "1": "The existence of a distinct extremum (maximum) in TPO yield with pyrolysis temperature was noted by many researchers, including: Murillo et al. [89], Rombaldo et al. [104], D ũng et al. [108], Pradhan and Singh [50] and Luo and Feng [115].",

    "question_text": "What are the key physicochemical properties of tyre pyrolysis oil that limit its direct use in automotive compression-ignition engines, and how do these properties affect combustion and emissions?",
    "standard_answer": "TPO's high viscosity (typically 3-6 mm²/s at 40°C, but can exceed standards), elevated sulfur content (often 1000-1500 ppm), and high polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) concentrations are primary limitations. High viscosity impairs atomization in fuel injectors, leading to larger droplet sizes, poorer air-fuel mixing, and incomplete combustion—increasing particulate matter (PM) and unburnt hydrocarbon (UHC) emissions. Sulfur compounds poison aftertreatment catalysts (e.g., diesel oxidation catalysts and SCR systems), reducing NOx conversion efficiency and increasing sulfate PM. PAHs contribute directly to soot formation through nucleation and surface growth mechanisms during combustion, exacerbating PM emissions. Additionally, TPO's lower cetane number (CN) compared to diesel prolongs ignition delay, elevating premixed combustion phases and peak temperatures, which can increase NOx formation via the Zeldovich mechanism. These properties collectively challenge compliance with EN 590 and emission regulations like Euro VI.",
    "original_text": {
      "1": "Generally, a well-known fact is that crude TPO complies with neither EN 590 nor ASTM D-2 as a standalone, drop-in fuel because of its high viscosity and large amounts of impurities [17].",

    "question_text": "How do pyrolysis temperature and residence time affect the formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in tyre pyrolysis oil, and what are the implications for particulate matter emissions during combustion in compression-ignition engines?",
    "standard_answer": "Pyrolysis temperature and residence time significantly influence PAH formation in tyre pyrolysis oil through secondary reactions of aromatic compounds. Higher temperatures and longer residence times promote aromatization reactions where benzene derivatives undergo further transformations into more complex polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. During the second stage of pyrolysis, benzene and its derivatives undergo further reactions to form more aromatic compounds such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) [56], which are problematic from the point of view of exhaust emissions. The favourable conditions for aliphatic compounds aromatization to PAHs are high temperatures and residence time [58]. When TPO containing elevated PAH levels is combusted in compression-ignition engines, these compounds act as precursors for particulate matter formation. The high aromatic content, particularly PAHs, contributes to increased soot nucleation and growth during combustion, leading to elevated particulate matter emissions. This poses challenges for meeting stringent emission standards, especially in automotive applications where particulate matter limits are strictly regulated. Consequently, controlling pyrolysis conditions to minimize PAH formation is essential for reducing engine-out particulate emissions and improving compliance with emission regulations.",

    "standard_answer": "The comparison of reactor types reveals significant differences in TPO yield performance. Fluidized bed reactors achieve maximum TPO yield, while fixed bed and mechanically mixed reactors provide approximately 10% lower TPO production efficiency. This difference stems from fundamental process characteristics: 'Fast pyrolysis yields more liquid fraction, due to avoided secondary reactions, whereas the main product of slow pyrolysis is a solid fraction.' Fluidized bed reactors typically operate as fast pyrolysis systems with rapid heating rates and short vapor residence times, minimizing secondary cracking reactions that would otherwise convert liquid products into gases or promote solid formation. In contrast, fixed bed reactors often represent slow pyrolysis conditions with longer residence times, allowing more extensive secondary reactions that reduce liquid yield in favor of solid char production. The enhanced mixing and heat transfer in fluidized beds enable more efficient and uniform thermal decomposition of tyre materials at optimal temperatures, maximizing primary pyrolysis reactions that produce liquid TPO while suppressing undesirable secondary reactions that lead to increased solid fraction formation.",
