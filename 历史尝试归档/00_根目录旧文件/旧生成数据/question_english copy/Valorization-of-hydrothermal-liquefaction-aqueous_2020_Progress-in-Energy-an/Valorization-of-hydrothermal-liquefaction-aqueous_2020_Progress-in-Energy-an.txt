Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is a thermochemical conversion technology that shows promising com- 
mercial potential for the production of biocrude oil from wet biomass. However, the inevitable produc- 
tion of the hydrothermal liquefaction aqueous phase (HTL-AP) acts as a double-edged sword: it is con- 
sidered a waste stream that without additional treatment clouds the future scale-up prospects of HTL 
technology; on the other hand, it also offers potential as an untapped nutrient and energy resource 
that could be valorized. As more researchers turn to liquefaction as a means of producing renewable 
fuel, there is a growing need to better understand HTL-AP from a variety of vantage points. Speciﬁcally, 
the HTL-AP chemical composition, conversion pathways, energy valorization potential, and the intercon- 
nection of HTL-AP conversion with biofuel production technology are particularly worthy of investiga- 
tion. This paper extensively reviews the impact of HTL conditions and the feedstock composition on 
the energy and elemental distribution of process outputs with speciﬁc emphasis on the HTL-AP. More- 
over, this paper also compares and contrasts the current state of value-added products separation along 
with biological (biomass cultivation, anaerobic fermentation, and bioelectrochemical systems) and ther- 
mochemical (gasiﬁcation and HTL) pathways to valorize HTL-AP. Furthermore, life cycle analysis (LCA) 
and techno-economic assessments (TEA) are performed to appraise the environmental sustainability and 
economic implications of these different valorization techniques. Finally, perspectives and challenges are 
presented and the integration approaches of HTL-AP valorization pathways with HTL and bioreﬁning are 
explored.

1. Introduction 

Global  climate  change  caused  by  the  accumulation  of  green- 
house  gas  (GHG)  emissions  has  caused  concerns  regarding  the 
world’s continued reliance on fossil fuels. Thus, the shifting of so- 
ciety’s dependence away from petroleum to renewable biomass re- 
sources is generally viewed as an important contributor to the de- 
velopment of a sustainable industrial society and effective way to 
manage the reduction of GHG emissions [ 1 , 2] . In recent years, the 
production of transportation fuels from wet biomass has received 
increasing attention due to its promising potential. For example, 
there are 77 million dry tons of wet biomass generated per year in 
the United States, including sludge, animal manure, and food waste 
[3] . Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is a thermochemical conver- 
sion technology that converts wet biomass into biocrude oil at el- 
evated temperatures (250–400 °C) and pressures (4–22 MPa) [ 4 , 5] . 
Unlike  other  thermochemical  technologies,  such  as  combustion 
and pyrolysis, HTL can sidestep the energetically costly drying step 
by directly utilizing wet biomass (food waste, microalgae, lignocel- 
lulose, sewage sludge, etc.) as a feedstock to produce biocrude oil 
[6–9] . HTL can produce biocrude oil with a modest yield (40–83%) 
and  appreciable  heating  value  (28–40  40  MJ/kg)  similar  to  that 
of petroleum crude oil [10] . Chen et al. veriﬁed that HTL-derived 
biocrude oil could be further upgraded via distillation combined 
with esteriﬁcation, and the results demonstrated that the viscosity, 
acidity, and energy content of the upgraded oil were commensu- 
rate with existing transportation infrastructures based on engine 
tests  [11] .  Now,  research  has  shifted  towards  mild  upgrading 
techniques, including emulsiﬁcation, esteriﬁcation, and hydrotreat- 
ing to further improve the quality of biocrude oil for large-scale 
production [ 11 , 12] . 

liquefaction aqueous phase (HTL-AP). It’s well known that a given 
feedstock  with  a  high  water  content  can  be  directly  treated  via 
HTL  due  to  the  incorporation  of  water  as  the  reaction  medium. 
The feedstock water content can be classiﬁed as either free water 
(water that can be separated mechanically) or bound water (water 
that  is  diﬃcult  or  unable  to  be  isolated  due  to  entrapment  or 
attraction to materials). The conversion of the bound water within 
the  feedstock  into  free  water  is  the  main  water  loss  pathway 
during HTL [13] . In the subcritical hydrothermal region, the weak- 
ening  of  hydrogen  bonds  in  water  coupled  with  a  decrease  in 
the dielectric constant leads to the dominance of in situ hydroxyl 
radicals  which  further  promotes  the  thermochemical  conversion 
of  organic  matter  in  the  raw  materials  [ 14 , 15] .  Thus,  the  water 
molecules within HTL-AP are derived from not only the moisture 
present  within  the  feedstock  but  also  from  the  dehydration  of 
feedstock  components  enhanced  via  HTL.  A  large  amount  of  or- 
ganic matter will also be converted into the liquid phase during 
HTL, and the direct dissolution of inorganic materials in the feed- 
stock will inevitably lead to the transformation of metal ions into 
the  HTL-AP  [16] .  These  are  the  main  pathways  that  explain  the 
evolution of the aqueous phase production and composition during 
thermochemical conversion. 

Since biocrude oil is the primary product of interest when con- 
ducting  HTL,  little  attention  has  been  placed  on  the  HTL-AP,  in 
spite of the fact that a substantial amount of C and N are trans- 
ferred to HTL-AP through various reaction pathways [ 17 –19] . The 
characteristics of the HTL-AP are highly dependent on the initial 
feedstock  and  reaction  conditions  used  during  the  HTL  process. 
Additionally, the conversion pathway and migration trends of the 
chemical components in the feedstock to the aqueous products are 
still unclear. 

Despite the potential of HTL technology, a distinct bottleneck of 
the HTL process that limits its economic and technical scalability 
is  the  production  of  a  by-product  known  as  the  hydrothermal 

The valorization of HTL-AP plays a critical role in determining 
the pathways towards commercial viability of HTL of wet biomass 
( Fig. 1 ). The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has even recognized

has  been  observed  for  biological  conversion.  In  addition,  limited 
information  is  provided  in  the  literature  comparing  technical, 
economic,  and  environmental  challenges  of  these  approaches.  In 
order  to  determine  how  the  valorization  of  the  aqueous  phase 
would impact the HTL process from energetic, economic, and en- 
vironmental vantage points, the intricacies of these processes need 
to be further elucidated. To maximize the economic and energetic 
upscale  viability  of  the  HTL  process,  it  is  essential  to  determine 
the  methodology  needed  to  unleash  the  energy  present  within 
HTL-AP. 

Herein,  a  current  review  of  the  state  of  the  art  technology 
utilized  to  valorize  HTL-AP  is  elucidated.  First,  a  description  of 
the current state of HTL research is expounded, emphasizing the 
impact  of  the  feedstock  and  reaction  conditions  on  the  product 
balance, elemental balance, and energy balance. Second, the pre- 
dominant conversion pathways for the valorization of HTL-AP are 
illustrated,  including  value-added  products  separation,  biological 
conversion, thermochemical conversion, and a combination of the 
aforementioned processes. Third, life cycle assessments (LCA) and 
techno-economic  assessments  (TEA)  are  presented  in  order  to 
quantify the beneﬁts of the different processes and assess the fea- 
sibility of upscaling and commercializing HTL technology. Finally, 
the challenges and future prospects for the valorization of HTL-AP 
are explained and described.

2.1. Process description and scale-up challenges 

HTL produces four primary products: biocrude oil, solid residue, 
aqueous phase, and gaseous phase. Previous studies have primarily 
focused on analyzing the impact of the reaction temperature (250–
375 °C), retention time (5–90 min), solid fraction (5–20%), and re- 
action pressure (10–20 MPa) on bench scale HTL process outputs. 
However, there are notable differences between HTL conducted at 
the bench scale and pilot scale. Fig. 2 illustrates representative ex- 
amples of the HTL experimental procedure and setup conducted at 
the bench scale and the pilot scale. 

Although standardization of operating procedures and reaction 
methodology  has  been  achieved at  the  bench  scale,  one  notable 
difference  between  these  two  scales  of  HTL  is  the  incorporation 
of an extraction solvent in bench studies. The extraction agent is

valorizing  HTL-AP  as  a  critical  enhancement  that  needs  to  be 
met  before  HTL-derived  oil  can  achieve  an  overall  fuel  selling 
price  of  $3.00/gallon  gasoline  equivalent  (GGE)  [20] .  To  date, 
HTL-AP  has  only  been  viewed  as  a  waste  by-product  and  not 
viewed  as  a  potential  avenue  of  energy  and  economic  output. 
Due  to  the  chemical  complexity  and  general  toxicity  of  HTL-AP, 
anaerobic  fermentation,  hydrothermal  gasiﬁcation,  biomass  cul- 
tivation,  thermochemical  recycling  and/or  integrated  pathways 
have shown potential as advantageous routes towards treating and 
re-utilizing HTL-AP compared with conventional wastewater treat- 
ment.  Previous  studies  have  conﬁrmed  that  gas  fuels  (hydrogen, 
methane) and electricity could be produced via biological [ 21 , 22] , 
bioelectrochemical  [ 23 , 24] ,  and  thermochemical  processing  of 
HTL-AP [ 25 , 26] . Further the remaining nutrients and water could 
support  the  cultivation  of  microalgae  [27] .  In  addition,  valued 
added chemicals and organic solvents can be separated and con- 
centrated [28] . However, there are still some unsolved challenges 
that  face  the  valorization  of  HTL-AP.  For  example,  inhibition

incorporated  to  selectively  isolate  biocrude  oil  from  the  solid 
residue  and  aqueous  fraction  [29 , 30] .  Currently,  three  ex- 
traction  solvents  are  commonplace  in  the  literature:  acetone, 
dichloromethane,  and  toluene  [6 , 29 , 31 , 32] .  However,  pilot  scale 
HTL  does  not  necessitate  the  incorporation  of  an  extraction  sol- 
vent; reaction products are instead separated by density. Therefore, 
whether  or  not  bench  scale  data  can  be  utilized  to  predict  the 
potential of pilot scale technology remains a point of contention 
among researchers. 

In recent years, bench continuous HTL reactors (as opposed to 
batch HTL reactors) have become the focal point of process devel- 
opment for biocrude oil production technologies. Although there is 
no speciﬁc boundary to delimit batch and pilot scale processes, a 
reactor volume of 1 L is used to demarcate the difference between 
bench  and  pilot  scale  HTL  processes  in  the  subsequent  analysis. 
Table 1 depicts recent studies conducted at both the bench con- 
tinuous and pilot scale for HTL conversion. Different bench scale 
continuous reactors have also been reported in recent years. These 
reactors are one step closer to the pilot scale implementation of 
HTL technology since this operation leads to similar mass and en- 
ergy transfer outputs in comparison to pilot scale reactors. Wagner 
et al. designed a vertical double tube reactor to liquefy microalgae 
and  achieved  higher  biocrude  oil  yields  than  conventional  batch 
reactors [33] . A 190 mL continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) was 
also used to conduct continuous bench-scale HTL, which presented 
lower  yields  and  a  higher  distribution  of  heavy  chemical  com- 
pounds in comparison to oil produced from a batch reactor [34] . 
Plug  ﬂow  reactors  (PFR)  are  the  most  common  continuous  HTL 
reactor implemented at the bench scale. Dried distillers grain from 
the bioethanol industry was successfully converted into bio crude 
oil  with  a  PFR  in  a  preceding  study,  leading  to  a  mass  yield  of 
38.9% ± 3.2% [35] . Microalgae were also studied with two different 
PFRs that had different reactor sizes (0.098 L and 1 L) using the 
same  reaction  temperature.  Both  reactors  resulted  in  promising 
biocrude yields, 37–40% and 38–64%, respectively, which indicated 
the  feasibility  of  using  microalgae  as  a  bench  scale  continuous 
HTL  feedstock  [ 36 , 37] .  Microalgae  in  this  preceding  study  was 
able to be reliably used up to a solid content of 35 wt.%. Paciﬁc 
Northwest National Laboratory also conducted HTL on macroalgae 
and  grape  pomace  with  a  1  L  PFR,  and  the  yield  amounted  up 
to  58.8%  and  50–56%  under  identical  reaction  conditions  (350 °C 
and 200 bar), respectively [ 38 , 39] . Most of the above bench scale 
continuous HTL reactors faced similar engineering challenges. For 
example, high-pressure slurry pumping, heat exchange integration, 
and continuous product separation all remained critical obstacles 
impeding ideal HTL processing. 

Studies concerning bench scale continuous reactors have pro- 
vided a solid foundation for the development of pilot scale reactor 

design. However, there are still only a limited number of studies 
conducted  at  the  pilot  scale  (reactor  volume  greater  than  1  L). 
Aalborg University conducted co-liquefaction of aspen wood and 
glycerol with a total reactor volume of 10 L [40] . The biocrude oil 
yield in this study ranged from 20–33%. However, in another study 
where the oil and aqueous phase were recycled from the previous 
run and mixed with the wood in the feed slurry, the biocrude oil 
yield  was  able  to  reach  up  to  45%  [41] .  Recirculation  of  the  oil 
and aqueous product promoted additional conversion of oil prod- 
ucts because water soluble organics and phenolic oil compounds 
demonstrated the ability to improve homogeneity and rheological 
properties of the feed [42] . Suesse et al. reported that ﬁlamentous 
fungi also generated a similar biocrude oil yield (48-61%) to mi- 
croalgae utilizing a 1.5 L PFR [43] . A 20 L HTL PFR was developed 
by Aarhus University, and this pilot scale reactor was utilized to 
conduct HTL with a variety of feedstocks, including energy grass, 
microalgae, and sewage sludge [44] . The average reported biocrude 
oil production yield was 26%, 33%, and 25% for these three feed- 
stocks,  respectively.  Another  PFR  with  a  reactor  volume  of  ap- 
proximately 5 L was developed by the University of Sydney which 
used organic co-solvents and short residence times (3-5 minutes) 
to  reach  a  yield  up  to  25%  with  macroalgae  [45] .  Finally,  the 
University of Illinois developed a pilot scale HTL PFR using food 
waste and swine manure as the feedstock. The biocrude yield was 
not documented in this study; however, the biocrude quality was 
studied  and  the  resulting  product  could  be  upgraded  and  was 
successfully implemented as a drop-in fuel for a diesel engine [11] . 
According to the data present in the literature, the scale of the HTL 
system is inversely correlated with the biocrude oil yield. In other 
words,  bench  scale  PFR  systems  led  to  greater  yields  than  pilot 
scale PFR systems. This might be caused by reactant interaction, 
heat transfer, and mass transfer limitations at the pilot scale com- 
pared to the bench scale. However, the speciﬁc reasons need to be 
further investigated and elucidated. 

Although HTL shows promise as a means of producing biocrude 
oil and other products via a myriad of feedstocks at the bench and 
pilot  scale,  the  Environmental  Protection  Agency  still  has  yet  to 
certify any HTL pathways under the Renewable Fuel Standard [46] . 
According to the literature, the primary pitfalls and challenges fac- 
ing the scale-up of HTL technology from the bench-scale are listed 
below: 

• Due  to  the  incorporation  of  subcritical  water  as  the  reaction 
medium, upscale HTL technology faces large issues with reac- 
tor corrosion [47] . However, this problem can be sidestepped 
by adjusting the reaction medium pH through the addition of 
homogeneous catalysts (Na 

3 , etc.) [40 , 48] .

• Research  suggests  that  increasing  the  feedstock  solid  content 
augments  the  biocrude  oil  yield  and  process  eﬃciency  while 
maintaining a near constant energy ratio [49] . However, main- 
taining a pumpable, homogeneous slurry with a high solid con- 
tent ( > 30 wt.%) remains a critical process development chal- 
lenge  necessitating  the  further  development  of  high  pressure 
pumps [48] . 

• The  feedstock  type  (lignocellulosic  biomass,  algae,  etc.)  leads 
to  economic,  energy,  and  operation  complexity  tradeoffs  that 
must be considered when transitioning from batch to contin- 
uous  biocrude  oil  production.  Establishing  a  pumpable  slurry 
is  a  crucial  process  development  hurdle  that  can  be  handled 
via mechanical (grinding, milling, etc.), technical (high-pressure 
feeding system), or chemical (acid/base pre-treatment) method- 
ologies [ 50 , 51] . 

• The formation of char derivatives (phenolic char, polyaromatic 
char, etc.) via polymerization and re-polymerization reactions is 
a large issue which reduces the biocrude oil yield and can lead 
to clogging of large-scale systems [ 52 , 53] . 

• Catalysts  incorporated  to  decrease  reaction  severity,  improve 
the yield, and enhance the quality of biocrude oil are suscep- 
tible to poisoning, coking, and sintering by nitrogen-containing 
and sulfur-containing species. Current catalyst usage, recovery, 
and  reactivation  techniques  are  cumbersome,  ineﬃcient,  and 
costly [54] . New techniques need to be developed in order to 
eﬃciently improve the reusability of catalysts. 

• Biocrude oil from biomass feedstock contains a relatively high 
content  of  oxygen-containing  and  nitrogen-containing  deriva- 
tives. Thus, further upgrading and subsequent economic expen- 
diture is necessary for HTL-derived biocrude oil to be a viable 
commodity on the market. 

• Novel strategies need to be investigated that explore the pos- 
sibility of integrating or retroﬁtting conventional crude oil re- 
ﬁning techniques within the biocrude oil production paradigm. 

Strategies might include concurrent upgrading of a biocrude oil 
and  petroleum  oil  blend  via  conventional  hydrotreating  reac- 
tors,  co-processing  using  ﬂuid  catalytic  crackers,  or  fractional 
distillation with subsequent co-processing [ 49 , 55] . 

• Pilot scale data is needed in order to assess the real economic, 
environmental, and societal implications of HTL technology. 
• Large-scale  biocrude  oil  production  leads  to  the  continual 
discharge of HTL-AP, which cannot be directly discharged into 
the environment due to the presence of concentrated organic 
contaminants. Methods need to be explored to eﬃciently and 
effectively valorize (gasiﬁcation, anaerobic digestion) or re-use 
(recirculation to reactor) this aqueous product [49] in order to 
further improve the economic, energetic, and process viability 
of HTL technology. 

2.2. Mass balance during HTL 

HTL  has  been  extensively  studied  for  a  myriad  of  feedstocks. 
Many studies extensively focus on algae biomass, since algae have 
a high biomass productivity, its growth sidesteps the food-versus- 
fuel  debate,  it  can  be  grown  on  wastewater,  and  it  can  recycle 
carbon from CO 
2 -rich ﬂue gas emissions from stationary sources 
[56] .  Furthermore,  oleaginous  microalgae  have  demonstrated 
the  ability  to  outproduce  oilseed  crops  in  terms  of  biocrude  oil 
yield  [56] .  In  addition  to  algal  biomass,  other  feedstocks  have 
also  garnered  attention  in  recent  years,  including  animal  waste, 
agricultural  waste,  human  waste,  and  processing  waste  [ 6 , 57–
59] .  Research  has  shown  that  the  composition  of  the  feedstock 
in  tandem  with  the  reaction  conditions  (temperature,  retention 
time, etc.) impact the HTL product and by-product mass balance, 
elemental balance, and energy recovery. Table 2 summarizes the 
recent modeling studies conducted utilizing the contents of bio- 
chemical components in the HTL feedstock to predict the biocrude

oil  and  HTL-AP  yield.  ANOVA  analysis  conducted  by  researchers 
has led to the consensus that the content of lipids (0.85–0.97) and 
proteins (0.2–0.42) in the HTL feedstock signiﬁcantly contribute to 
the biocrude oil yield while the content of carbohydrates (0.05–
0.22) only plays a minor role in modeling the predicted yield of 
biocrude oil ( Table 2 ). Binary and ternary studies have indicated 
that  carbohydrates  could  play  a  greater  role  in  inﬂuencing  the 
biocrude  oil  yield  when  interacting  with  protein  components 
in  the  feedstock,  which  is  known  as  the  Maillard  reaction  [60] . 
However, previous studies have concluded that binary mixtures of 
proteins and carbohydrates can both contribute negatively (-0.016) 
and positively (0.4) to biocrude oil predictions models [ 60 , 61] . This 
may be attributed to the Maillard reaction resulting in the accu- 
mulation of the solid residue at low temperatures (300 °C) while 
forming  biocrude  oil  components  at  high  temperatures  (350 °C) 
[62] . 

With regard to the HTL-AP, researchers have not reached a con- 
sensus on the extent to which the biochemical components con- 
tribute to the HTL-AP yield. Li et al. previously reported that the 
protein content (0.24) dictates the yield of HTL-AP, whereas Fages 
et al. conversely came to the conclusion that the lipid (0.95) and 
carbohydrate  content  (0.48)  are  better  indicators  of  the  HTL-AP 
yield [ 63 , 64] . Therefore, further modeling studies need to be con- 
ducted in order to better understand the impact of the biochemical 
components on the HTL-AP yield. However, correlation analysis has 
begun to shed light on the impacts of the biochemical components 
on the product mass balance and the characteristics of the differ- 
ent HTL products. 

Fig.  3  presents  the  principal  component  analysis  (PCA)  and 
ternary chart indicating the correlation between the HTL feedstock 
components and the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of 
the biocrude oil, solid residue, and HTL-AP [64] . With regard to the 
biocrude oil, the lipid content of the feedstock is positively corre- 
lated with the C content, H content, energy recovery, oil yield, and 
higher heating value (HHV). Both the protein content and carbohy- 
drate content are correlated with negative characteristics, includ- 
ing a high O content and N content in the biocrude oil, respec- 
tively.  With  regard  to  the  solid  residue,  the  content  of  carbohy- 
drates demonstrates positive correlations between the C content, H 
content, N content, and yield. The lipid content and protein content 
do not correlate with any of the solid residue output parameters. 
With regard to the HTL-AP, correlation analysis indicates that the 
protein content is instrumental in determining the yield. However, 
it should be noted that these correlations may differ when utiliz- 
ing  a  different  feedstock  and  when  different  reaction  conditions 
are utilized. This is due to the fact that temperature and retention 
time of HTL have been shown to heavily inﬂuence the quantity and 
quality of the HTL output parameters. 

Temperature and retention time are the two reaction conditions 
which inﬂuence the HTL process to the greatest extent [4] . In or- 
der to combine the collective effects of both temperature and re- 
tention time into a single parameter, the severity factor is often 
employed [ 26 , 71 , 72] . Fig. 4 illustrates the inﬂuence of the severity 
factor on the mass balance of the HTL process [ 8 , 32 , 58 , 59 , 73–80] . 
Fig.  4  demonstrates  that  the  biocrude  oil  yield  is  positively  cor- 
related with an increase in the reaction severity up to a certain

extent. After a certain severity factor is reached, the biocrude oil 
yield then decreases. The speciﬁc temperature and retention time 
at which this decrease occurs is dependent on the feedstock chem- 
ical composition. The reason for this trend is due to the fact that 
at lower reaction severities char and organics in the water-soluble 
fraction can be converted into biocrude oil. This is caused by char 
accumulating at a low severity factor. A previous study noted that 
at  higher  temperatures  the  activation  energy  required  for  bond 
cessation for hydrolysis and decomposition/depolymerization reac- 
tions  is  easily  overcome,  resulting  in  the  formation  of  a  greater 
amount of biocrude oil by conversion of the HTL by-products [81] . 
Another study noted that at lower temperatures the peptide bonds 
present  in  protein  molecules  are  more  stable  than  the  glyosidic 
bonds  in  carbohydrates  and  lignin.  Thus,  at  lower  temperatures 
protein derivatives are unlikely to be converted, whereas at higher 
temperatures these protein derivatives can be effectively cleaved 
and transformed into the biocrude oil phase [80] . Qu et al. found 
that  at  high  temperatures  (340–360 °C),  increasing  the  retention 
time resulted in a decrease in the biocrude oil yield, which could 
be explained by the re-polymerization and/or re-condensation of 
the newly formed oil products [82] . This was also conﬁrmed by 
another study which discovered that increasing the retention time 
from 15 minutes to 30 minutes decreased the biocrude oil yield 
from approximately 20% to 15% [83] . In contrast to raising the re- 
tention  time,  extreme  temperature  conditions  favor  biocrude  oil 
cracking  reactions  which  convert  the  biocrude  oil  into  gaseous 
compounds [75] . 

Reactor heating rate is also another factor that can inﬂuence the 
HTL  process.  Recent  studies  have  shown  that  high  heating  rates 
can enhance fragmentation of biomass and inhibit the formation 
of char [84] . Biller et al. demonstrated that continuous HTL em- 
ployed with high heating rates (915 and 230 °C/min) and low resi- 
dence times (1–6 min) led to the highest biocrude oil yields and 
energy  recoveries  [37] .  Lower  heating  rates  have  been  hypothe- 
sized to decrease the biocrude oil yield through the enhancement 
of side reactions (re-polymerization, condensation, oligomerization, 
etc.) that could enhance the production of the solid product yield 
and lower the biocrude oil yield [ 84 , 85] . Tran et al. also noted a 
clear correlation between heating rate and biocrude oil yield. This 
study found that when the heating rate increased from 66 °C/min 
to 179 °C/min, the biocrude oil yield increased by 16.9%, resulting 
in  a  decrease  in  the  solid  yield  by  16%  under  the  same  heating 
rate [86] . One study demonstrated that HTL conducted at identical 
severity factors could have different yields and heating values that 
varied based on the heating rate [87] . Thus, severity factor may not 

be able to provide a complete picture, and heating rate may need 
to be incorporated to better understand a holistic view of how the 
temperature and time impact the HTL products. However, it should 
be noted that researchers have found conﬂicting results. One study 
found that biomass conversion of 86% could be achieved at a heat- 
ing rate of 2 °C/min and only a 63% conversion could be achieved 
at a higher heating rate of 20 °C/min [88] . This is contrary to pre- 
vious  studies  that  determined  that  a  high  heating  rate  was  cor- 
related with a high biocrude oil yield. These contradictory results 
were also conﬁrmed by Kamio et al. [89] . Thus, the inﬂuence of the 
heating rate on the biocrude oil yield and properties may work in 
tandem with other factors to inﬂuence the biomass conversion and 
biocrude oil yield, including the feedstock type, the onset temper- 
ature, and the residence time. 

With regard to the solid residue yield, studies have conﬁrmed 
that it  decreases as the temperature and reaction time increase. 
Shakya et al. found that when the HTL temperature for algae in- 
creased from 250 °C to 300 °C the solid residue yield signiﬁcantly 
decreased.  However,  at  temperatures  exceeding  300 °C  no  signif- 
icant  reduction  of  the  solid  yield  was  observed  [80] .  This  could 
be explained by the organic components in the solid residue be- 
ing  converted  to  other  HTL  products.  However,  inorganic  matter 
is subjugated to the solid fraction and is not affected by the in- 
creased reaction severity. A previous study indicated that the re- 
action time had an insigniﬁcant impact on the solid residue yield 
and that temperature led to the greatest inﬂuence in determining 
the solid yield [90] . Thus, the general trend is that solid residue ac- 
cumulates at low reaction severities due to the recalcitrance of lig- 
nocellulosic compounds and protein-containing compounds; how- 
ever, at higher severities these compounds are converted into the 
biocrude oil or cracked into the gaseous phase. 

With regard to the aqueous phase, reports have not yet reached 
a consensus on the impact of the reaction severity on the HTL-AP 
yield ( Fig. 4 ). Previous studies have indicated that protein and car- 
bohydrate derivatives tend to preferentially dissolve in the aque- 
ous phase, leading to a greater concentration of the aqueous phase 
for a high protein and carbohydrate feedstock. Therefore, the aque- 
ous phase is often rich in organic acids, cyclic amine derivatives, 
and N/O heterocyclic compounds [ 73 , 91] . It has also been hypoth- 
esized that HTL tends to predominately yield aqueous products at 
low temperatures and short retention times; however, at high reac- 
tion severities oxygen-containing (e.g. phenols, furfurals, etc.) and 
nitrogen-containing derivatives (fatty acid amides, furans, etc.) can 
be converted into the biocrude oil phase [92] . At low temperatures, 
carbohydrate  derivatives  can  degrade  into  compounds  including 

8 

J. Watson, T. Wang and B. Si et al. / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 77 (2020) 100819 

cellohexaose,  cellopentaose,  glyceraldehydes,  and  furfurals  which 
generally  dissolve  into  the  aqueous  fraction.  Thus,  some  studies 
have  indicated  that  for  a  high  carbohydrate  feedstock,  a  higher 
accumulation  of  the  aqueous  phase  is  expected  [63] .  However, 
at  higher  reaction  temperatures  these  compounds  may  undergo 
radical reactions contributing to the formation of large molecular 
weight components (e.g. asphaltenes, asphaltene derivatives, etc.) 
in the biocrude oil [93] . Additionally, it has been reported that the 
water  soluble  components  produced  at  lower  reaction  severities 
could be re-polymerized at higher reaction severities, thereby in- 
creasing  the  yield  of  biocrude  oil  [94] .  Thus,  additional research 
needs  to  be  conducted  to  determine  the  mechanism  by  which 
biochemical components and HTL reaction products are converted 
into the aqueous phase as a function of the reaction conditions. 

2.3. Elemental migration during HTL 

The  feedstock  and  reaction  conditions  also  work  in  tandem 
to inﬂuence the elemental migration and distribution of the HTL 
products.  Fig.  5  presents  a  representative  depiction  of  how  the 
feedstock macromolecules are transferred to the reaction products 
via HTL as a function of temperature [73] . Generally speaking, the 
range of chemical constituents that can enter the biocrude oil and 
HTL-AP phases is quite broad, including N-, O-, and S-containing 
heterocycles, cyclic and acyclic hydrocarbons (e.g. oleﬁns, alkynes), 
etc.  Conversely,  the  range  of  compounds  that  are  distributed  to 
the solid phase is fairly limited (ash, cyclic oxygenates). However, 
this model has been met with contention. Previous studies have 
indicated that the HTL process may not be unidirectional and in 
fact may involve secondary reaction pathways. Valdez et al. used 
a kinetic model to demonstrate that the formation of HTL-AP and 
biocrude oil compounds is only dominant within the ﬁrst few min- 
utes. As the retention time increases, there exists an interconver- 
sion between the oil, solid, and HTL-AP phases, thereby allowing 
for the interlacing of chemical compounds in each fraction [95] . 
This was further conﬁrmed in a previous study which indicated the 

contribution of the Maillard reaction to the solid residue, which is 
generally associated with the formation of biocrude oil at higher 
temperatures and lower retention times [62] . Thus, due to the se- 
vere  reaction  conditions  employed  when  using  HTL,  the  speciﬁc 
chemical transformations of biochemical macromolecules are con- 
stantly  in  ﬂux,  leading  to  a  lack  of  transparency  on  the  speciﬁc 
reaction pathways present for HTL. 

Fig. 6 illustrates the reported elemental composition and HHV 
of HTL-derived biocrude oil from numerous studies irrespective of 
the  reaction  conditions  [ 6 , 10 , 29 , 37 , 58 , 59 , 66 , 74 , 77–80 , 90 , 96–102] . 
According to the results presented in Fig. 6 , the average C, H, N, 
O, S and HHV values of biocrude oil reported in previous studies 
is 70%, 4%, 15%, 10%, 1%, and 33 MJ/kg, respectively. The C con- 
tent exhibits the largest content range of all other elements, due 
to  the  fact  that  previous  studies  have  indicated  that  the  C  con- 
tent is more susceptible to changes in the reaction conditions than 
the other elements. Christensen et al. observed that increasing the 
temperature from 275 °C to 350 °C increased the C content in the 
HTL-derived biocrude oil of algae from 63% to 77% [103] . Yu et al. 
also  corroborated  this  trend,  noting  that  the  C  recovery  of  the 
biocrude  oil  produced  from  low-lipid  microalgae  increased  from 
0.4 to 35.4% as the reaction temperature increased from 100 °C to 
300 °C [104] . However, previous studies have noted that the C re- 
covery tends to diminish when the temperature reaches the criti- 
cal point of water (~374 °C), because reactions favoring the cracking 
of  biocrude  oil,  due  to  the  change  in  the  thermodynamic  prop- 
erties  of  water,  occur  when  exceeding  the  supercritical  state  of 
water [57] . 

It should also be noted that at the critical point of water, the 
density  of  water  and  the  ionic  product  drastically  changes  from 
800 to 150 kg/m 3 and from a pK range of 11-14 to a pK value of 
up to 21 [105] . This is under the assumption that both the reaction 
temperature and pressure are at the supercritical point of water. 
Even when the supercritical temperature is exceeded, ionic prop- 
erties of water may be recovered when the pressure is further in- 
creased. In previous studies, the impact of supercritical conditions

on the kinetics of HTL reactions was investigated. One study noted 
that exceeding the supercritical conditions diminished the kinetics 
of  glucose  and  fructose  degradation  due  to  the  shift  from  ionic 
reactions  to  free-radical  reactions  [106] .  Thus,  reactions  without 
a  dependence  on  ions  (retro-aldol  condensation  reactions,  etc.) 
are  favored  under  supercritical  conditions;  however,  reactions 
with a dependence on ions (dehydration reactions, isomerization 
reactions,  etc.)  are  diminished  [107] .  Another  hypothesis  is  that 
the  reaction  pathway  may  shift  towards  char  formation  for  the 
thermochemical conversion of lignocellulosic materials when high 
reaction temperatures are incorporated. Compared with supercrit- 
ical water, subcritical water has relatively limited interaction with 
the resulting solid residue product due to the lower diffusivity of 
water  under  these  conditions  [108] .  Preceding  studies  have  also 
demonstrated  that  the  decomposition  rate  constants  associated 
with some chemical species was facilitated by pressure when HTL 
reactions  occurred  near  the  critical  pressure  and  temperature  of 

water [ 109 , 110] . Thus, the conversion eﬃciency is highly enhanced 
when  water  reaches  its  supercritical  point  [ 111 , 112] .  In  essence, 
the effect of pressure is different on subcritical and supercritical 
water.  Under  subcritical  water,  temperature  is  the  predominant 
factor  that  inﬂuences  the  ionic  properties  of  water  and  the  re- 
action  eﬃciency,  whereas  above  the  supercritical  temperature 
of water, pressure also plays an important role and needs to be 
considered. 

Retention  time  also  has  an  inﬂuence  on  the  C  recovery,  but 
the impact of retention time is severely diminished at high tem- 
peratures. With respect to the other biocrude oil elements, most 
preceding studies have found that regardless of the reaction tem- 
perature and retention time, biocrude oil from myriad feedstocks 
still contains an unfavorable amount of O (13.7 ± 8.3%), N (4.3 ±
2.2%), and S (0.8 ± 0.4), all of which are signiﬁcantly higher than 
conventional oil products. In particular, one previous study noted 
the  recalcitrance  of  oxygen-containing  and  nitrogen-containing 

10 

J. Watson, T. Wang and B. Si et al. / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 77 (2020) 100819 

derivatives  in  the  biocrude  oil  [78] .  Thus,  standard  HTL  reaction 
temperatures  and  retention  times  are  not  suﬃcient  to  produce 
a  high-quality  oil;  upgrading  with  the  incorporation  of  catalysts 
needs to be employed in order to effectively reduce the O and N 
content in HTL-derived biocrude oil and thereby allow HTL the op- 
portunity to become a mature and commercialized technology for 
mass fuel production [ 11 , 32 , 65 , 101 , 113] . In fact, recent studies have 
shown that both deoxygenation and denitrogenation are achievable 
through the incorporation of a NiMo/Al 
3 sulﬁded catalyst. In this 
study,  the  oxygen  content  from  the  biocrude  oil  produced  from 
three different HTL feedstocks could be effectively reduced to low 
levels (from an initial oxygen content ranging from 6.9–19.6 wt.% 
to 0–0.8 wt.%) and nitrogen could also be reduced (from an initial 
nitrogen content of 1.7–7.7 wt.% to 0.8 – 4.0 wt.%) [114] . Thus, de- 
spite the presence of heteroatoms after HTL, the presence of these 
O- and N-containing derivatives are by no means prohibitive; it is 
possible to signiﬁcantly reduce their content through subsequent 
processing. 

2 O 

With  regard  to  the  solid  residue,  an  abundance  of  inorganic 
compounds which take the form of ash tend to accumulate in this 
fraction [ 115 , 116] . However, reaction conditions involving a low pH 
and  a  low  heating  rate  can  also  lead  to  the  production  of  char 
derivatives which can accumulate in the solid fraction thereby in- 
creasing its C content. Previous studies are in agreement that in- 
creasing the reaction temperature and retention time is beneﬁcial 
towards converting organic matter from the solid residue into the 
biocrude oil and/or aqueous phase. One previous study employing 
cornstalk as an HTL feedstock found that increasing the temper- 
ature  from  210 °C  to  310 °C  decreased  the  C  content  of  the  solid 
residue by nearly 60% [58] . However, as previously mentioned, at 
temperatures above the critical point of water (~374 °C), this trend 
is  not  substantiated,  and  C  in  the  aqueous  phase,  solid  residue, 
and biocrude oil is converted to the gas phase. However, the pres- 
ence  of  carboniﬁcation  reactions  at  supercritical  conditions  may 
also lead to the conversion of carbon compounds into recalcitrant 
char or lignite in the solid residue, thereby indicating that at high 
temperatures  the  chemical  content  of  the  feedstock  may  play  a 
larger role in determining the elemental migration into the solid 
residue [117] . 

With  regard  to  the  HTL-AP,  previous  studies  have  noted  that 
nearly one third of the organic carbon in the feedstock is trans- 
ferred  to  the  aqueous  phase  during  the  HTL  process  [ 104 , 118] . 
Moreover, a majority of nitrogen-containing compounds have been 
found  to  accumulate  in  the  aqueous  phase.  This  is  due  to  the 
deamination of amino acids which produces aqueous-soluble am- 
monia  ( Fig.  5 ).  Thus,  as  the  HTL  temperature  increases,  nitro- 
gen  derivatives  preferentially  dissolve  into  the  HTL-AP.  Yu  et  al. 
demonstrated that increasing the reaction temperature decreased 
the N recovery in the biocrude oil while increasing the N recovery 
in the aqueous phase form 1.1% to 73.5% [104] . Previous studies 
have also noted the abundance of organic acids (acetic acid, lac- 
tic acid, etc.) and alcohol derivatives in the HTL-AP, which could 
lead to a high C content in the aqueous phase at low temperatures 
[59] . The N and O content can also be attributed to the presence 
of oxygen-containing and nitrogen-containing heterocycles (pyrro- 
lidine,  pyrrole-derivatives,  etc.)  [18] .  Previous  studies  noted  that 
both  higher  temperatures  and  higher  reaction  times  resulted  in 
an  aqueous  phase  with  a  high  content  of  N  [118] .  In  particu- 
lar,  one  study  found  that  as  the  reaction  temperature  increased 
from 260 °C to 340 °C, the total organic carbon (TOC) of the HTL- 
AP  only  increased  slightly  from  50.92  mg/L  to  57.14  mg/L  while 
the total nitrogen (TN) increased dramatically from 1,973 mg/L to 
3,836 mg/L [119] . However it should be noted that the feedstock 
chemical composition will heavily impact the content of N that in- 
evitably ends up in the aqueous phase. Despite the high content of 
nitrogen-containing and oxygen-containing derivatives, the HTL-AP 

has the potential to be recycled and reused due to its high nutrient 
content [120] . 

2.4. Energy and nutrient balance during HTL 

Based  on  the  above  analysis  of  the  pathways  and  elemental 
distribution  from  the  feedstock  to  the  HTL  products,  the  C,  N, 
and  energy  recovery  of  recent  HTL  studies  was  quantiﬁed  ir- 
respective  of  reaction  conditions  and  feedstock  composition  to 
discern the current state of energy and nutrient balances within 
the HTL paradigm. Fig. 7 illustrates the C, N, and energy balance 
of  the  oil,  solid,  and  aqueous  via  a  2D  kernel  density  diagram 
[ 29 , 58 , 59 , 75 , 116 , 121] .  The  ability  to  recovery  a  large  portion  of 
the feedstock energy through HTL has been previously reported. 
Yu et al. demonstrated that a maximum energy recovery of 65.4% 
was achieved at 280 °C with a 120 min retention time for biocrude 
oil  derived  from  low-lipid  microalgae  [104] .  Reddy,  et  al.  simi- 
larly found that a large fraction of the initial energy in the Nan- 
nochloropsis sp. (78.0%) and Chlorella sp. (61.3%) could be converted 
into biocrude oil [94] . Similarly to the preceding studies, analyzing 
the impact of extraction solvents on the HTL process found that 
the energy consumption ratio (ECR) from high-carbohydrate, high- 
protein,  and  high-ash  algae  ranged  from  0.29–0.73  [29] .  Similar 
to the biocrude oil yield trends, the energy recovery of the HTL 
process  initially  reaches  an  apex  and  thereafter  decreases  with 
increasing  reaction  severities.  Tang  et  al.  veriﬁed  this  trend  by 
noting  that  the  energy  recovery  resulting  from  the  HTL  of  two 
algae species, Nannochloropsis sp. and Chlorella sp., increased from 
52.6% (220 °C) and 31.3% (220 °C) and reached a maximum energy 
recovery of 69.9% (280 °C) and 58.1% (260 °C) but then decreased 
thereafter  to  66.6%  (30 0 °C)  and  37.0%  (30 0 °C),  respectively  [78] . 
This trend has also been corroborated by another preceding study 
[79] .  The  decrease  in  the  energy  recovery  at  high  reaction  tem- 
peratures could be attributed to the cracking of biocrude oil [78] . 
However, this could also be attributed to charring/condensation re- 
actions which shift the product distribution to produce more solid 
residue as opposed to biocrude oil. 

Energy  return  on  investment  (EROI)  analysis  indicated  that  a 
low-lipid  HTL  feedstock  is  not  attractive  from  an  energetic  per- 
spective, and that this type of feedstock is only feasible when the 
biocrude oil is utilized as a low-grade burning fuel [101] . Further, 
it has been shown that low temperature HTL (200 °C) for microal- 
gae with a high lipid content is ideal, because it produces oil that 
can be easily catalytically converted due to its low concentration 
of  heteroatoms  and  asphaltenes  [101] .  This  was  conﬁrmed  by  a 
previous  study  which  found  that  mild  reaction  conditions  also 
produced the highest energy content (40.1 MJ/kg) for a low lipid 
content algae in comparison to harsh reaction conditions. However, 
this  trend  was  not  substantiated  for  a  low-lipid  feedstock  [122] . 
Anastasakis et al. also demonstrated that the HTL process is energy 
intensive when the water loading is high. This can be attributed to 
the high heat capacity of water, which caused the ECR in this study 
to increase from 0.9 to 3.8 as the biomass/water ratio increased 
from 2:10 to 2:40 [83] . This study came to the conclusion that high 
reaction temperatures and a high water content can lead to unfa- 
vorable energy recovery values and high ( > 1) ECR values. However, 
it should be noted that these conclusions assume the use of sub- 
critical water. When water exceeds the supercritical point (374 °C, 
22 MPa), energy conclusions will be impacted accordingly due to 
changes in the water characteristics, including the speciﬁc heat and 
speciﬁc enthalpy of water [123] . 

Fig. 7 also demonstrates that a large portion of energy (37.9 ±
18.0%), C (36.1 ± 14.0%), N (75.4 ± 18.9%) remains trapped within 
the HTL-AP. Therefore, ineﬃciency plagues the HTL process, indi- 
cating the need for further processing and valorizing of the HTL-AP 
to ensure the commercial viability of HTL technology. One previous

study analyzing the EROI for treatment of HTL-AP noted that treat- 
ment  technology  for  the  aqueous  phase  reduced  the  HTL  EROI 
by  upwards  of  30%.  However,  this  could  be  mitigated  by  re- 
covering  the  nitrogen  and  phosphorus  within  the  HTL-AP  [124] . 
Thus,  the  energy  ramiﬁcations  of  HTL-AP  treatment  techniques 
needs to be carefully considered before implementation. It should 
be  noted  that  HTL  also  produces  a  gaseous  product  that  consti- 
tutes  a  relatively  miniscule  fraction  of  the  mass  balance  ( < 10%) 
[ 27 , 29 , 58 , 59] .  Previous  studies  have  indicated  that  the  composi- 
tion of the gaseous product primarily consists of carbon dioxide 
( > 90%)  [59] .  Therefore,  the  gaseous  fraction  was  assumed  to  be 
purely composed of carbon dioxide. Thus, according to the mass 

balance  and  elemental  composition  of  the  HTL  gaseous  fraction, 
the gaseous fraction only accounted for 8.6 ± 5.3% of the C bal- 
ance. Speciﬁc trends regarding the C and N balance are inﬂuenced 
both  by  the  feedstock  composition  and  the  reaction  conditions 
( Figs. 3 , 4 , and 6 ). However, the energy utilized in the HTL reac- 
tion process and in the resulting products can be looked at from a 
couple of different vantage points. 

2.5. The characteristics of HTL-AP 

The  feedstock  and  reaction  conditions  (temperature,  total 
solid  content,  and  reaction  time)  have  proven  to  complicate  the

composition  of  HTL-AP.  Fig.  8  summarizes  the  reported  charac- 
teristics  of  typical  HTL-AP  from  various  feedstocks  in  previous 
studies, including manure [ 23 , 26 , 27 , 59 , 116 , 125–133] , algae [ 17–19 , 
25 , 27 , 77 , 97 , 119 , 120 , 127 , 134–156] ,  lignocellulose  [ 22 , 24 , 40 , 118 , 141 , 
157–162] , and sludge [ 128 , 146 , 163–165] . The pH of the HTL-AP de- 
rived from lignocellulose biomass showed a signiﬁcant difference 
compared  to  the  HTL-AP  derived  from  other  types  of  feedstock, 
which normally tend to be acidic with a pH ranging from 3.5–5. 
As  a  means  of  comparison,  HTL-AP  from  algae  typically  had  an 

alkaline pH that ranged from 7.8–8.5. HTL-AP derived from manure 
and sludge showed a wider pH range, but the average pH amongst 
preceding studies was predominantly neutral. Thus, the pH of HTL- 
AP has been shown to be tightly related to the feedstock compo- 
sition. Table 3 summarizes the main composition of typical feed- 
stock utilized for HTL. Algae with a high protein content tends to 
result in a HTL-AP with a high content of ammonia derived from 
protein hydrolysis and deamination, which in turn leads to an al- 
kaline pH [168] . This is also conﬁrmed by the TN and ammonia

concentration in HTL-AP ( Fig. 8 ). As for utilizing lignocellulose as 
an HTL feedstock, the acidic nature of the aqueous stream is likely 
the result of the presence of organic acids which formed from the 
degradation of either monomeric sugars or carbohydrates present 
in lignocellulose. The resulting pH of HTL-AP has broader implica- 
tions on its valorization potential, because a neutral pH is recom- 
mended for methane production via anaerobic digestion, and low 
pH values are favored for the use of HTL-AP as an acidic catalyst to 
improve the heat pretreatment eﬃciency of lignocellulose biomass 
[169] . 

HTL-AP has a high concentration of organics, which has been 
conﬁrmed  by  the  chemical  oxygen  demand  (COD)  concentration 
( Fig. 8 ). Similar COD values for HTL-AP derived from manure, algae, 
and sludge have been reported, which led to average COD values of 
80.5, 84.4, and 80.8 g/L, respectively. HTL-AP derived from lignocel- 
lulose biomass tended to lead to a lower COD (24.3 g/L) than the 
other  types  of  HTL-AP.  Similar  distribution  trends  were  also  ob- 
served with respect to the TOC concentration. Both the COD and 
TOC values indicated that a substantial amount of energy remained 
in  the  HTL-AP,  which  suggests  that  further  valorization  of  HTL- 
AP  would  beneﬁt  the  energy  recovery  of  the  HTL  system.  How- 
ever, HTL-AP valorization techniques have stringent requirements, 
as  most  biological  conversion  techniques  may  not  accommodate 
high organic loadings. For example, the organic loading of anaer- 
obic fermentation is typically around 10 g COD/L [170] , and this 
value is typically 1–6 g COD/L for bioelectrochemical systems [23] , 
which suggests that heavy dilution is necessary before biological 
conversion methods can be incorporated. 

The  TN  concentration  mostly  varied  from  3–12  g/L  and  from 
4–15 g/L for HTL-AP derived from manure and algae, respectively. 
HTL-AP  derived  from  sludge  tends  to  have  a  high  TN  content, 
although  the  available data  for  this  type  of  feedstock  is  limited. 
The HTL-AP derived from lignocellulose biomass had the lowest N 
distribution with an average value of 0.8 g/L. TN in HTL-AP mainly 
consisted of ammonia and organic nitrogen. Only a limited content 
of  nitrate  nitrogen  was  observed  (constituting  only  9.0–0.1%  of 
the  total  TN)  [ 120 , 135 , 147] .  HTL-AP  derived  from  manure  and 
sludge  had  similar  ammonia  contents  with  an  average  value  of 
0.8  and  1.7  g/L,  respectively.  In  comparison,  the  HTL-AP  derived 
from  algae  had  a  much  higher  ammonia  content  which  varied 
from  0.2– 16.0  g/L,  leading  to  an  average  value  of  6.9  g/L.  The 
total phosphorus (TP) content in HTL-AP derived from algae was 
found to be much higher than the other three types of feedstocks. 
This was attributed to the higher content of phospholipids, DNA, 
and phosphate monoesters present within algae. In addition, the 
TP  content  in  HTL-AP  was  related  to  the  metal  contents  in  the 
feedstock and the extraction method utilized to separate HTL-AP 
from the biocrude oil [168] . Moreover, high contents of potassium 
(K), sodium (Na), and magnesium (Mg) were found in the HTL-AP 
derived  from  both  manure  and  algae.  In  particular,  the  average 
concentration of K in the HTL-AP derived from these two types of 

feedstock reached up to 4,258 and 2,251 mg/L, respectively. Other 
metals including aluminum (Al), calcium (Ca) and iron (Fe) were 
also observed in HTL-AP; however, the concentration of these met- 
als remained low, only accounting for a concentration of less than 
100 mg/L. 

Fig. 8 suggests that HTL-AP derived from lignocellulose biomass 
had a lower TN concentration than HTL-AP derived from algae, ma- 
nure, and sludge. This is because the composition of HTL-AP is cor- 
related with the feedstock composition [64] . HTL-AP derived from 
lignocellulose biomass was reported to have the lowest N content 
compared with manure, algae, and sludge ( Table 3 ). PCA further 
conﬁrmed the positive correlation between TN, ammonia, and the 
protein  content  of  the  feedstock.  Conversely,  a  negative  correla- 
tion existed between the TN, ammonia content, and the carbohy- 
drate/lipid content. The TOC concentration in HTL-AP also showed 
a strong positive relationship with the protein content, whereas a 
negative relationship between the TOC concentration and the lipid 
and carbohydrate content was observed. This further validates the 
fact that HTL-AP generated from algae, manure, and sludge had a 
higher TOC concentration than that of HTL-AP derived from ligno- 
cellulose biomass ( Fig. 9 ), since the latter consists of carbohydrates 
and only a limited amount of protein compared to the other types 
of feedstock ( Table 3 ). HTL-AP tends to be a high-strength TOC and 
TN stream, since in most cases wet biomass with a high protein 
content (algae, manure, etc.) is applied to the HTL process. In ad- 
dition, the C and N contents in HTL-AP are also inﬂuenced by the 
HTL conditions. For example, Liu et al. reported that the Fe/HZSM- 
5  catalyst  affected  elemental  migration  during  the  HTL  process, 
and an increase in the N content and decrease in the organic car- 
bon content present within the HTL-AP was observed [19] . 

2.5.1. Distribution of organic compounds in HTL-AP 

The  HTL-AP  contains  a  high  concentration  of  organics,  which 
pose a signiﬁcant challenge for subsequent valorization. The gen- 
eral  quantiﬁcation  of  organics  reported  in  previous  studies  for 
HTL-AP is described in Fig. 8 . A further look into the composition 
of  the  organic  components  in  HTL-AP  is  required  in  order  to 
better  understand  the  HTL-AP  and  develop  optimal  valorization 
approaches.  Table  4  summarizes  the  quantiﬁcation  of  major  or- 
ganic  constituents  (wt.%)  identiﬁed  in  the  HTL-AP  derived  from 
sludge  [146] ,  food  industry  wastes  (FIW)  [146] ,  algae  [145] ,  and 
lignocellulosic  feedstock  [159] ,  respectively.  The  HTL-AP  was  ob- 
tained using the same continuous processing bench scale system 
(Paciﬁc  Northwest  National  Laboratory)  with  similar  operational 
conditions  for  all  types  of  feedstock  (339–353 °C,  10.3–17.6  wt.%, 
1.3–2.1 L/h). The quantiﬁed results illustrate the complicated com- 
position and signiﬁcant difference between HTL–AP resulting from 
different types of feedstock. A higher organic acids concentration 
(over 2 wt.%) was found in HTL-AP resulting from lignocellulosic 
biomass (corn stover and loblolly pine) when compared with other 
feedstock. The organic acids mainly included acetic acid, glycolic 
acid, formic acid, glycolic acid, and propanoic acid. In particular, 
the  concentration  of  acetic  acid  and  glycolic  acid  in  HTL-AP  de- 
rived from corn stover reached up to 0.878 wt.% and 1.678 wt.%, 
respectively. It is well-known that hemicellulose and cellulose are 
hydrolyzed into monosaccharides during HTL. These monosaccha- 
rides  are  unstable  and  could  be  converted  into  furfural,  5-HMF, 
glycolaldehyde,  and  methylglyoxal.  At  harsh  reaction  conditions, 
these products could be further converted into organic acids such 
as  acetic  acid  [167] .  In  addition,  phenol,  2-methoxyphenol,  and 
4-ethylphenol  are  also  observed  in  the  HTL-AP  of  lignocellulosic 
biomass.  Barbier  et  al.  conﬁrmed  these  compounds  were  con- 
verted from lignin [171] . For HTL-AP derived from food waste, an 
abundant  content  of  acetic  acid  (0.590  wt.%)  and  ethanol  (1.021 
wt.%) was observed. The high concentration of ethanol present in 
HTL-AP of food waste may have resulted from the feedstock. For

nitrogen (TN) concentration (c), and principal component analysis (PCA) (d). Data points (24) collected from [64] . 

instance, a signiﬁcant amount of ethanol is retained by wet grape 
pomace  following  wine  fermentation  [146] .  The  HTL-AP  derived 
from  sludge  was  also  reported  to  have  a  similar  distribution  of 
organics  in  comparison  to  the  HTL-AP  derived  from  food  waste. 
However,  compared  with  HTL-AP  from  food  waste,  HTL-AP  from 
sludge has a lower acetic acid and ethanol concentration, and it 
has  a  much  higher  concentration  of  nitrogen-containing  organ- 
ics,  including  amides  (N-methyl  succinimide)  and  N-heterocyclic 
compounds (pyrazine, methyl pyrazine, 2-pyrrolidinone, 1-methyl 
2-pyrrolidinone,  and  2-piperidinone).  It  has  been  reported  that 
organic  nitrogen  constituted  7–40%  of  the  TN  when  HTL  was 
operated at 350 °C [127] . Although organic nitrogen only accounts 
for a small percentage fraction of organic nitrogen in TN, organic 
nitrogen is still one of the most important entities present within 
HTL-AP  when  considering  its  high  concentration  ( Fig.  8 ).  The 
HTL-AP derived from algae resulted in the highest concentration of 
nitrogen-containing organics (reaching up to 1.153 wt.%), consist- 
ing of a wide variety of nitrogen-containing derivatives, including 
N-heterocycles, amines, and amides ( Table 4 ). 

To date, a substantial amount of organics in HTL-AP have been 
quantiﬁed ( Table 4 ), but there are some organics in HTL-AP that 
remain  unknown.  Approximately  64–82%  of  the  TOC  for  HTL-AP 
derived  from  lignocellulosic  feedstock  is  able  to  be  successfully 
quantiﬁed [159] . This range was reportedly much higher than HTL- 
AP generated from algae (45–72% of the TOC) [145] . The percentage 
of  quantiﬁable  TOC  of  HTL-AP  generated  from  FIW  and  sludge 
has a similar range of 40 −70% [145] . As for the nitrogen organics, 
5–59% of the components within HTL-AP are unable to be deter- 
mined [ 145 , 146] . One reason to explain this could be the presence 
of  many  low  concentration  compounds  that  are  below  the  de- 
tection limit. Additionally, these organics may be high molecular 
weight  molecules  that  are  unidentiﬁable  by  conventional  chro- 
matography  apparatuses.  Maddi  et  al.  discovered  two  kinds  of 
protein oligomers in HTL-AP which have molecular weights of 210 
and  250,  respectively  [145] .  Chen  et  al.  veriﬁed  the  presence  of 
high-molecular-weight organics (MW > 10 0 0) in HTL-AP from rice 
straw via gel ﬁltration chromatography, and these organics proved 
to  be  diﬃcult  to  biologically  convert  [157] .  Si  et  al.  conﬁrmed 
that  these  high  molecular  weight  organics  were  associated  with 
nitrogen-containing  moieties  [21] .  These  high  molecular  weight 

molecules  in  HTL-AP  may  originate  from  monosaccharides  and 
amino acids reacting together via the Maillard reaction [172] . This 
assumption also could be supported by the fact that more com- 
pounds are unidentiﬁable for the HTL of feedstocks rich in protein 
and carbohydrates (algae and sludge) rather than feedstocks with 
a composition solely dominated by carbohydrates (lignocellulosic 
biomass). This is due to the fact that a feedstock with a high pro- 
tein and high carbohydrate content tend to promote the Maillard 
reaction whereas feedstock only containing lignocellulosic material 
does  not.  However,  the  characteristics  of  high  molecular  weight 
organics  have  still  not  been  fully  understood,  including  their 
speciﬁc structure, quantiﬁcation, and potential application outside 
the HTL paradigm. Therefore, this area of work needs to be further 
investigated. 

2.5.2. Distribution of inorganic compounds in HTL-AP 

Inorganic  compounds  are  abundantly  distributed  in  HTL-AP, 
4 3 −, K, Na, Mg, Al, Ca, and Fe. The distribution 
such as ammonia, PO 
of these inorganic elements are tightly related to the composition 
of the biomass utilized for HTL. For example, HTL-AP derived from 
algae and manure exhibit a high ammonia concentration because 
of the large content of N in the feedstock compared with lignocel- 
lulosic biomass. A previous study noted that the aqueous stream 
generated  from  HTL  of  saline-water  algae  contained  a  higher 
content of Na, Mg, K, and Ca than that of freshwater algae cultures 
which  can  be  attributed  to  the  growth  substrate  [145] .  Table  5 
shows the heavy metals distribution in HTL-AP for various types of 
feedstock. The highest concentration of Zn was observed in HTL- 
AP derived from manure. This is because Zn is typically added to 
animal feed to promote healthy conditions for animal growth, but 
it is eventually excreted into urine and manure. In addition, Cu, Pb, 
Cd, Cr were also detected in livestock manure [173] . Lignocellulose 
biomass may also concentrate heavy metals from the cultivation 
medium.  For  example,  the  HTL-AP  derived  from  lignocellulose 
irrigated  with  untreated  household  wastewater  and  sewage  was 
reported to have a Zn concentration of 3 mg/L [118] 

Generally, ammonia-nitrogen accounts for the largest fraction of 
nitrogen in HTL-AP due to the deamination of protein in the feed- 
stock and the cracking of N-containing derivatives [174] . As for P, 
only a limited number of studies have investigated the distribution

of P in the aqueous phase, and the P content in HTL-AP is typically 
very low. The phosphorus speciation in HTL-AP consists of reactive 
P (inorganic phosphorus and loosely-bound organic forms of phos- 
phorus released by hydrolysis during HTL) and unreactive P (or- 
ganic and condensed forms of phosphorus) [175] . Shi et al. demon- 
strated  that  more  than  80%  of  the  feedstock  P  was  transferred 
to  HTL-AP,  and  approximately  98%  of  the  P  could  be  recovered 
by  struvite  precipitation  by  varying  the  pH  of  the  hydrothermal 
conversion process with HCl [176] . Huang et al. reported that the 
predominant speciation of P derived from sludge via hydrothermal 
treatment was orthophosphate due to the hydrolysis of pyrophos- 
phates  and  polyphosphates  in  the  aqueous  medium  [177] .  A 
similar ﬁnding was also observed by Wang et al. [178] . The limited 
content of P in the HTL-AP is due in part to a large fraction of the 
feedstock P preferentially being distributed into the solid residue 
during hydrothermal conversion. This results from the presence of 
metals (e.g. Mg, Al, and Ca) which can impact the phase migration 
of P-containing derivatives, thereby leading to P retention in the 
solid  residue.  For  instance,  previous  studies  have  reported  that 
manure and sludge, feedstocks that contain a high content of met- 
als (e.g. Ca, Mg, Cu, Cd and Zn), caused the formation of insoluble 
phosphate  precipitates  enhanced  by  the  presence  of  P-binding 
metals [179–181] . 

In  addition,  the  metals  soluble  within  HTL-AP  are  related  to 
the chemical properties of each distinctive metal. HTL-AP has been 
reported to recover between 30–50% of Mg in the HTL feedstock 
[150] . Heavy metals were found to almost exclusively migrate into 
the  solid  residue  phase.  It  has  been  reported  that  most  of  the 
K  ( > 89%)  and  Na  ( > 73%)  in  the  manure  were  released  into  the 
aqueous phase while a majority of the Ca ( > 89%), Mg ( > 81%), Al 
( > 88%), Fe ( > 72%), and Zn ( > 94%) migrated into the solid residue 
[59] . Xu et al. found that only a limited (0.5–1.0%) amount of heavy 
metals (Cu, Cr, and Zn) were distributed into the HTL-AP derived 
from sewage sludge, while the vast majority (93.2–98.9%) of metals 
were distributed into the solid residue [165] . Another study inves- 
tigating six types of animal manure also conﬁrmed that the ma- 
jority of heavy metals (70%–98% of Zn and Cu, 71%–99% of Pb, and 
87%–98% of Cd) were concentrated into the solid residue. Thereby, 

a migration and transformation pathway of heavy metals during 
HTL was proposed, in which most heavy metals in the feedstock 
were  transferred  into  the  solid  residue  through  various  mecha- 
nisms,  including  cation  exchange,  physical  adsorption,  precipita- 
tion, complexation, and crystallization [5] . 

The inorganics in HTL-AP would affect downstream processing. 
For  example,  the  dominant  inorganics  (ammonia,  TP,  K,  Na,  and 
Mg) within HTL-AP were derived from macronutrients, and these 
inorganics  could  potentially  be  used  as  a  fertilizer  or  as  culture 
media for algae growth. However, nickel (Ni) in HTL-AP was found 
to be the main inhibitory factor for algal growth [120] . Moreover, 
the alkali and alkaline earth metals, such as Na, Mg, K, and Ca, may 
interfere with other catalytic materials used during hydrothermal 
gasiﬁcation [145] . 

2.5.3. Toxic compounds 

Due to its high concentration of toxic compounds, HTL-AP poses 
a potential safety and health hazard if it is directly discharged into 
the environment. Pham et al. investigated the mammalian cell cy- 
totoxicity of speciﬁc nitrogen organics used as a surrogate to rep- 
resent HTL-AP, a mixture of multiple nitrogen organics extracted 
from HTL-AP and the complete HTL-AP matrix [182] . The results 
showed that the mixture of nitrogen organics extracted from HTL- 
AP was highly cytotoxic to mammalian cells, and a 7.5% raw HTL 
aqueous phase concentration led to a 50% reduction in cell density 
during a chronic cytotoxicity assay. Elliott et al. summarized a list 
of hazardous constituents in the HTL-AP, which mostly consisted of 
aromatic compounds and nitrogen-containing organics. In particu- 
lar,  some  of  the  compounds  were  considered  hazardous  even  at 
very low concentrations, such as 2-propenol, 2-propenal, aziridine, 
and 2-methylaziridine [183] . 

The heavy metals in HTL-AP also pose a signiﬁcant environmen- 
tal and safety concern, especially for HTL-AP derived from sludge 
and manure. Various heavy metals, including Pb, Zn, Cu, Cd, Cr, and 
Ni have been detected in HTL-AP. The speciﬁc distribution of met- 
als among the output products during the HTL process has been 
reported to be directly related to the reaction conditions (temper- 
ature, catalyst, and addition of other feedstock). One point to clar- 
ify is that HTL has been proven to reduce the risk associated with 
heavy metals compared with the raw feedstock. Li et al. reported 
that HTL signiﬁcantly reduced the contamination level of specia- 
tion fractions for multi-metals and single metals (Cu, Zn, Pb, and 
Cd) in livestock manure using individual contamination factor (ICF) 
and global contamination factor (GCF) risk assessments [5] . Similar 
results were also found by Leng et al., which conﬁrmed the reduc- 
tion of risk associated with Pb, Zn, Cu, and Ni in sewage sludge 
after HTL [184] . 

As  shown  in  Fig.  10 ,  previous  research  has  veriﬁed  that  the 
majority  of  heavy  metals  in  the  HTL  feedstock  are  concentrated 

Fig. 10.  The migration and transformation of heavy metals during HTL. Adapted from [7] .

17 

into the solid residue, which constitutes a low to medium environ- 
mental risk [184] . The low concentration of heavy metals in HTL 
biocrude  oil  is  beneﬁcial  for  enhanced  combustion,  thereby  im- 
proving oil stability during storage and further upgrading processes 
[136] . Although HTL lessens the risk associated with heavy metals 
by migrating a majority of the metals to the solid residue, safety 
hazards still exists for the subsequent usage of HTL-AP due to the 
presence of heavy metals [7] . For example, the mercury (Hg) in rice 
grains was found to be much higher than the maximum allowable 
amount when using HTL-AP from swine manure as a fertilizer for 
cultivation [185] . Hence, further investigation is needed to better 
understand the valorization techniques necessary to promote toxi- 
city remediation. One way to approach this problem is to develop 
methodology to ensure that the heavy metals remain concentrated 
and immobilized in the solid residue. In addition, demetalization of 
the feedstock before HTL or demetalization of HTL-AP before val- 
orization could also be effective techniques. 

3. Separation of value-added chemicals from HTL-AP 

3.1. Separation of organics in HTL-AP 

Organic compounds in HTL-AP have a wide variety of applica- 
tions ranging from the production of liquid fuels to the extraction 
of high-value chemicals. For example, ethanol is a substitute trans- 
portation  fuel  for  gasoline,  and  the  application  of  ethanol  could 
reduce  crude  oil  consumption,  conserve  nonrenewable  energy, 
and reduce GHG emissions [186] . The acetic acid present within 
HTL-AP could be used as an input for the manufacturing of vinyl 
acetate monomers and terephthalic acid, which could be further 
used for the production of polyethylene terephthalate [187] . Gly- 
colic acid which accumulates in high concentrations in the HTL-AP 
derived  from  lignocellulosic  biomass  has  been  proven  to  be  an 
effective cosmetic ingredient, and in recent years is in increasing 
demand [188] . Phenol could be easily and directly used by con- 
ventional  petrochemical  processes  which  is  used  for  pigments, 
dyes, resol resins, anitoxidatnts, urea resins, formaldehyde resins, 
and  alkyl  phosphite  production  [189] .  Various  nitrogen  organics 
that accumulate in HTL-AP derived from manure, sludge, and algae 
can  be  utilized  as  intermediate  chemicals  for  the  production  of 
value-added products. Higashio and Shoji reported the application 
of  these  nitrogen  organics  as  commodities  (e.g.  pharmaceuticals 
and  agrochemicals)  due  to  their  high  biological  activities  [190] . 
Pyridine is an excellent solvent for dehydrochlorination reactions 
and  the  extraction  of  antibiotics.  Methylpyridines  are  used  as 
starting  materials  for  pharmaceuticals  (anti-tuberculosis  agents), 
agrochemicals, and serve a critical role in the production of feed 
additives and anion exchangers. Pyrazines play an important role 
as  intermediates  for  perfumes,  pharmaceuticals,  and  agricultural 
chemicals [190] . In addition, nitrogen organics, such as 1-methyl- 
2-pyrrolidinone, are used as solvents during synthesized homoge- 
nous catalysis [191] . Additionally, acetamide has shown reasonably 
good thermal stability as a latent heat storage material in a solar 
system [192] . Amides have been used as fuel detergent-dispersant 
additives to improve engine performance, inhibiting the formation 
of gum and sludge in the combustion process and decreasing fuels 
consumption and pollution emissions [ 193 , 194] . 

However, HTL-AP is a complicated aqueous mixture consisting 
of dozens of chemicals. The separation and concentration of these 
chemicals from HTL-AP is a critical barrier to value-added chemical 
extraction. The separation of high-value organics from HTL-AP has 
been conducted in several preceding studies. Chen et al. reported 
the extraction of phenolic compounds from rice straw HTL-AP us- 
ing a modiﬁed resin, and the total content of phenolic compounds 
in the aqueous solution increased from 18% to 78% after separation 
[28] . Lyu et al. conducted a separation of rice straw HTL-AP using 

two-stage  nanoﬁltration,  and  the  HTL-AP  was  fractionated  into 
three parts: glucose concentrate, monophenol and cyclopentenone 
concentrate,  and  acetic  acid  permeate  [195] .  Zhang  et  al.  also 
recovered  carboxylic  acids  from  a  model  HTL-AP  solution  [196] . 
Previous  studies  have  also  conducted  separation  of  high-value 
chemicals  using  HTL-AP  from  lignocellulosic  biomass  or  model 
HTL-AP solutions which have a simple distribution of organics. The 
separation of chemicals from complicated HTL-AP, such as HTL-AP 
derived from algae, has not yet been reported. 

It has been reported that separation technology currently ac- 
counts for 60-80% of the process costs of most mature chemical 
processes [197] . Hence, the economics and sustainability of HTL- 
AP separation technology needs to be evaluated in the context of a 
whole chemical process. The needed separation and concentration 
technology could be expensive and needs more R&D work before 
it can become a mainstream valorization option. 

3.2. Separation of inorganics in HTL-AP 

The inorganics within HTL-AP, such as N, P, and K, could be fur- 
ther separated for commercial fertilizer application. The nutrients, 
which  are  plagued  by  ﬂuctuating  energy  costs,  are  also  critical 
elements of food production. For example, the production of 1 ton 
of N requires the energy equivalent of seven barrels of oil [198] . In 
addition, P from geological deposits is being continually depleted 
[199] . Hence, separation of nutrients from HTL-AP is an attractive 
avenue  to  solve  this  quandary.  The  high  concentration  of  these 
nutrients in HTL-AP indicates its potential as a source for nutrients 
separation. The concentration of N, P, and K in HTL-AP generated 
from manure and algae have been reported to range from 5–20 g/L, 
1–10 g/L, and 1–8 g/L, respectively ( Fig. 8 ). Shanmugam et al. pro- 
posed to collect the N and P in HTL-AP as struvite, and the results 
showed that 99% of P and 40–100% of ammonium nitrogen in HTL- 
AP could be collected [200] . A high phosphate recovery amounting 
up  to  75%  was  also  achieved  from  HTL-AP  microalgae  using 
struvite [201] . The extracted struvite displayed excellent fertilizer 
qualities under speciﬁc conditions when compared with standard 
fertilizers [202] . Stripping is another approach to recover ammonia 
in HTL-AP which has been commonly employed in industrial ap- 
plications. The stripped ammonia could be adsorbed by an acidic 
solution and form a mineral fertilizer. It has been reported that up 
to 90% of the ammonia in HTL-AP was recovered using air strip- 
ping [201] . Membrane distillation is another technology which has 
been veriﬁed to generate liquid fertilizer with high concentrations 
of N and P from HTL-AP [133] . 

Although the separation of N and P has been proven to be fea- 
sible, further optimization of the separation methods needs to be 
conducted. For example, both ammonia stripping and struvite for- 
mation highly depend on the pH and operating temperature, and 
the separation of K still remains an unsolved challenge. In addi- 
tion, high concentrations of organics left in the remaining aqueous 
stream would need further valorization. 

4. Biological conversion of HTL-AP 

HTL-AP is a monetary and environmental burden to HTL biore- 
ﬁneries. Biological conversion strategies may enable the valoriza- 
tion of HTL-AP, which could lead to the production of hydrogen, 
methane,  electricity,  and  chemicals  through  different  pathways. 
These processes would subsequently make HTL technology more 
energy productive and cost-effective. 

4.1. Pretreatment before biological conversion 

The primary challenge hindering biological conversion of HTL- 
AP is the potential inhibitors, which may lead to a low conversion

eﬃciency and even a failure of biological conversion. The biochem- 
ical oxygen demand (BOD)/COD ratio of HTL-AP was reported to 
be within the range of 0.16-0.31 [ 24 , 129 , 203] . BOD/COD values in 
this range tend to make HTL-AP recalcitrant to biological conver- 
sion.  Thus,  proper  pretreatment  is  required  to  enhance  the  eﬃ- 
ciency  of  downstream  units.  The  main  methods  of  pretreatment 
are partial oxidation, adsorption, and extraction ( Table 6 ). The pur- 
pose of pretreatment is to remove or convert the inhibitors into 
easily biodegradable compounds. 

4.1.1. Partial oxidation 

Partial oxidation combined with biological conversion has been 
proposed to be an economically favorable alternative for treatment 
of  recalcitrant  waste  streams  [205] .  For  example,  Somensi  et  al. 
reported  a  signiﬁcant  improvement  of  biodegradability  and  a 
reduction of toxicity when comparing raw textile wastewater with 
wastewater treated via partial oxidation [206] . Oxidation methods 
primarily include ozonation, H 
2  treatment, UV irradiation, and 
2 O 
the chlorine and photo-Fenton process. Ozone treatment is one of 
the  most  attractive  methods  due  to  its  high  oxidation  potential. 
The primary product of ozonation is oxygen gas, and no secondary 
pollutant  compounds  are  produced.  It  has  been  proven  that  the 
inhibitors for biological conversion in HTL-AP, including aromatic 
ring structures [207] , N-heterocyclic compounds [208] , and furfural 
[209] , can be converted using ozone, and the produced carboxylic 
acids can then be easily converted utilizing biological methodology 
[205] . A preliminary study of ozone treatment was conducted by 
Yang et.al, and the results showed that all phenols and over 20% 
of the N-heterocyclic compounds in swine manure HTL-AP were 
transformed.  Further,  the  biodegradability  of  HTL-AP  was  im- 
proved by 33% [129] . H 
2 oxidation can also reduce the HTL-AP 
recalcitrance and lead to a higher production of methane during 
subsequent anaerobic fermentation [210] . However, the mechanism 
of partial oxidation for the complicated assortment of compounds 
present  within  HTL-AP  still  needs  to  be  further  investigated.  In 
addition,  the  oxidation  process  needs  to  be  well  controlled  in 
order to selectively convert the toxic compounds rather that all of 
the organics. In this manner, selective treatment of the recalcitrant 
compounds  can  decrease  the  economic  input  and  concomitantly 
circumvent the formation of other recalcitrant precursors. Jayakody 
et al. reported that when an excessive amount of H 
2  was ap- 
plied, anaerobic fermentation was negatively impacted. Speciﬁcally, 
the  methane  yield  decreased  and  the  lag-phase  increased  [210] . 
A  similar  result  was  also  observed  for  ozone-treated  HTL-AP. 
In  this  study,  an  increased  lag-phase  was  observed;  however,  a 
higher methane production rate and yield were achieved and the 
formation  of  recalcitrant  compounds  during  ozonation  was  also 
conﬁrmed [21] .

4.1.2. Adsorption 

Adsorption  selectively  isolates  the  inhibitors  from  HTL-AP 
utilizing a variety of different materials. Zeolite could effectively 
adsorb ammonia from HTL-AP to avoid inhibition caused by a high 
concentration of ammonia [211] . However, ammonia may not be

products 
The potential inhibitors for biological conversion are adsorbed, 
including N-heterocyclic compounds, aromatic compounds, and 
ammonia. 
The potential inhibitors for biological treatment are extracted 
from HTL-AP, including aromatic, nitrogen -containing organics, 
and ammonia

the  main  problem  for  biological  treatment  compared  with  other 
toxic organics in HTL-AP. Further research conducted by Li et al. 
veriﬁed that not only ammonia but also a portion of the nitrogen 
organics in HTL-AP could be adsorbed by zeolite, which led to an 
improved methane yield and shortened the lag-phase [143] . Acti- 
vated carbon has also been extensively investigated as an adsor- 
bent material for various waste streams [212] . Zhou et al. reported 
that activated carbon was shown to effectively mitigate the impact 
of recalcitrant compounds, thereby enhancing methane production 
and allowing digestion to proceed at higher HTL-AP concentrations 
(up to 33.3%), likely due to the ability of activated carbon to se- 
quester toxic organic compounds [130] . Zheng et al. compared the 
effect of zeolite, granular activated carbon (GAC), and polyurethane 
matrices addition on the aerobic digestion of HTL-AP. The results 
showed that GAC achieved the highest methane improvement and 
also demonstrated a good recovery of adsorption capacity in the 
second batch [156] . This suggested the superiority of activated car- 
bon as an adsorbent. Pham et al. found the GAC could signiﬁcantly 
reduce  the  cytotoxicity  of  HTL-AP  [182] .  Erkelens  et  al.  reported 
that the growth of Tetraselmis sp. could be signiﬁcantly improved 
with the application of activated carbon due to the adsorption of 
organic inhibitors [138] . Park et al. detoxiﬁed hydrothermal-treated 
Gelidium  amansii  with  activated  carbon  powder  to  diminish  the 
inhibitory  impact  of  5-hydroxymethylfurfural  (5-HMF)  and  other 
potential  inhibitory  compounds  [213] .  A  similar  result  was  also 
reported  in  a  methane  production  process  using  30%  GAC  pre- 
treated HTL-AP, resulting in an increase of the methane yield by 
162% [151] . 

However, one primary issue with adsorption is that this method 
just transfers the inhibitory compounds to another medium. Thus, 
once  the  inhibitors  have  been  isolated,  further  treatment  still 
remains an issue. Hence, the regeneration of the absorbent is very 
important. The used activated carbon has been previously reported 
to be effectively regenerated through thermal methods [214] , but 
the economic and practical consequences still need to be evalu- 
ated.  Biogeneration  is  another  possible  treatment  method;  how- 
ever,  bioregeneration  depends  on  the  types  of  adsorbed  organic 
compounds and the long-term feasibility of this method has yet 
to be elucidated. 

4.1.3. Extraction 

Extraction is another pretreatment method that can selectively 
isolate and enrich chemicals from HTL-AP. Petroleum ether, cyclo- 
hexane, dichloromethane, and ethyl acetate were previously used 
to extract compounds from rice straw HTL-AP. Results showed that 
petroleum  ether  extraction  resulted  in  increased  methane  yields 
which  was  attributed  to  the  separation  of  furans,  ketones,  and 
phenols  from  HTL-AP  [157] .  A  similar  result  was  also  reported 
during algae cultivation using HTL-AP after using ethyl ether to ex- 
tract nitrogen-containing and oxygen-containing derivatives [155] . 
Nitrogenous organic compounds were also extracted from Spirulina 
HTL-AP  using  dichloromethane;  however,  the  resulting  HTL-AP 
still showed cytotoxicity to mammalian cells [182] . Phenolic com- 
pounds,  known  inhibitors  for  biological  conversion,  have  been

reported to be successfully extracted by modiﬁed resins [28] and 
two-stage  nanoﬁltration  [195] .  The  ammonia  in  HTL-AP  derived 
from  algae  could  also  be  collected  as  struvite,  and  this  method 
could enhance subsequent biological treatment as it can prevent 
related inhibition [200] . One of the most advantageous aspects of 
extraction as a pretreatment method is that the extracted organics 
and  inorganics  from  HTL-AP  could  serve  as  value-added  chem- 
icals  as  previously  discussed  in  Chapter  3.  Moreover,  extraction 
also  augments  the  potential  for  further  biological  treatment  via 
inhibitor isolation. 

4.2. Nutrients for biomass production 

4.2.1. Algae cultivation 

Biofuels  production  from  algae  is  a  promising  avenue  for 
renewable  fuel  production,  because  growth  of  algae  does  not 
compete with food resources and involves no signiﬁcant changes 
to  land  use.  However,  media  that  can  support  rich  algal  growth 
still  requires  the  input  of  expensive  nutrients  including  N,  P, 
and  K  [215] .  HTL-AP  contains  a  high  concentration  of  N,  P,  K, 
and  micronutrients,  which  can  be  used  as  a  growth  media  for 
algae production. Jena et al. ﬁrst evaluated the feasibility of algae 
cultivation using HTL-AP. The results reported that a 50.5% algae 
yield  could  be  achieved  compared  with  a  synthetic  medium 
[142] . In recent years, extensive studies have been conducted to 
reveal the feasibility of algae cultivation using HTL-AP ( Table 7 ). 
An  “Environment-Enhancing  Energy” (E2-Energy)  paradigm  was 
proposed by Zhou et al. ( Fig. 11 ), involving the production of algae 
biofuels  while  simultaneous  recycling  the  inputs  by  internally 
capturing and recycling C and nutrients for the cultivation of algae 
biomass [27] . Based on the simulated mass balances for long-term 

Fig. 11.  Schematic of the Environment-Enhancing Energy paradigm for integrated 
HTL and algae-bacteria cultivation. Adapted from [27] . 

E2-Energy  operations  with  internal  recycling  of  nutrients  and  C, 
the proposed system could amplify biomass and biofuel production 
from wastewater by up to 10 times, thereby demonstrating the po- 
tential of this paradigm to replace fossil fuels using a wastewater- 
grown  feedstock  and  carbon  dioxide  from  the  atmosphere  as  a 
point source [216] . 

Table 7 summarizes recent studies conducting algae cultivation 
using HTL-AP as a growth medium. Various factors will affect the 
eﬃcacy of biomass production including the HTL conditions and 
algae cultivation process. Algae have been used as the predominant 
HTL feedstock in a majority of preceding studies, and most studies 
demonstrated that the nutrients present within HTL-AP could sup- 
port algae growth. In particular, even higher biomass concentra- 
tions (0.05–13.4 g/L) were achieved in HTL-AP than was obtained

by  using  conventional  synthetic  media  (0.12–4.9  g/L)  ( Table  7 ). 
Previous studies have demonstrated that N and P in HTL-AP could 
be converted through algae uptake and assimilation. Table 7 shows 
that most of the inorganic nitrogen (mainly consisting of ammo- 
nia) was removed during algae growth (over 80%). This could be 
attributed  to  the  fact  that  microalgae  cells  preferentially  utilize 
ammonia nitrogen, most likely because it is easier to convert am- 
monia nitrogen into amino acids [140] . The residual nitrogen was 
assumed to consist of many recalcitrant or slow-degrading com- 
pounds containing ring structures and nitrogen heteroatoms [27] . 
P has also been reported to be eﬃciently converted and utilized by 
algae ( Table 7 ). Notably, Desmodesmus sp. cultivation using HTL-AP 
from the same microalgae demonstrated that the lack of (macro- 
/micro-) nutrients was considered to be the main cause of growth 
inhibition  rather  than  toxicity  due  to  insuﬃcient  dilution  [140] . 
However, Edmundson et al. validated that all macronutrient com- 
ponents could be derived from HTL-AP, and there was no reported 
statistical  difference  between  the  group  containing  trace  metals 
and the control with respect to algae cultivation [217] . This con- 
ﬂicting result indicated that the macronutrients in HTL-AP for al- 
gae cultivation are related to the feedstock of HTL and the speciﬁc 
requirements of different algae species for effective growth. 

The effectiveness of algae cultivation using HTL-AP also highly 
depends  on  the  HTL  process  conditions.  Hognon  et  al.  found 
that the HTL temperature had an impact on the eﬃcacy of using 
HTL-AP as an algae cultivation medium [218] . This study showed 
that  a  much  higher  biomass  yield  was  achieved  using  HTL-AP 
produced at 220 °C rather than that at 310 °C. More speciﬁcally, an 
algal-growth  assay  and  response  surface  methodology  was  used 
to  study  how  HTL  operating  conditions  (260–300 °C,  30–90  min, 
15–35% total solids ratio) affect the inhibition of algae by HTL-AP. 
In this study, it was found that the algae biomass yield generally 
deceased as the total solids ratio, temperature, and retention time 
increased [216] . This was attributed to the distribution of inhibitors 
at various HTL conditions, which especially impacted the distribu- 
tion of the heterocyclic compounds and straight chain oxygenates 
[216] . 

Chlorella has been the most commonly used algae strain when 
utilizing HTL-AP as a cultivation medium ( Table 7 ). This could be 
explained by the fact that some species of Chlorella are obligate 
heterotrophic  microalgae  [219] ,  which  can  assimilate  organic 
compounds in HTL-AP, including glycerol and acetate [26] . Godwin 
et  al.  previously  tested  the  growth  of  Ankistrodesmus  falcatus, 
Chlorella  sorokiniana,  Pediastrum  duplex,  Scenedesmus  acuminatus, 
Scenedesmus ecornis , and Selenastrum capricornutum using HTL-AP 
as  a  culture  medium,  and  results  showed  that  Chlorella  could 
only tolerate up to 2% HTL-AP, and polycultures of 2–6 species of 
algae were viable at up to 10% [220] . Furthermore, this strategy of 
utilizing polycultures was better at balancing N and P eﬃciency in 
comparison to monocultures [221] . Phaeodactylum tricornutum was 
cultivated with 25-fold dilution of HTL-AP, which suggested that 
this strain was less sensitive than others to possible inhibitors in 
the HTL-AP [222] . Zhou et al. set up an algal-bacteria co-culture 
system  to  enhance  biomass  production,  and  biomass  cultivation 
with 100-times diluted HTL-AP was achieved after long-term adap- 
tation [27] . A similar system was also reported by Wang et al., in 
which a symbiotic relationship evolved between the algae and bac- 
teria [152] . Microalgae generate oxygen gas and extracellular com- 
pounds that allow aerobic bacteria to degrade organic pollutants, 
and the bacteria thereby beneﬁt algae metabolism by converting 
organic inhibitors, producing growth-promoting factors, and con- 
suming oxygen gas from the medium to relieve the oxygen damage 
to the microalgae. 

In addition, the eﬃciency of algae cultivation is also affected 
by  the  bioreactors.  A  biomass  yield  of  0.25  g/L  was  achieved 
in  an  algal  pond  using  seawater  and  0.1%  (vol.%)  HTL-AP  [153] , 

whereas  a  13.4  g/L  biomass  yield  was  achieved  in  a  ﬂat  panel 
airlift-photobioreactor  [222] .  Heimann  et  al.  outlined  a  novel 
bioﬁlm cultivation strategy that is water-smart and also offers the 
opportunity for direct energy conversion via HTL [223] . A syner- 
gistic growth of microalgae and bacteria with a biomass yield of 
1.6 g/L using HTL-AP was achieved in a membrane photobioreactor 
(MPBR), in which a membrane module was used for retaining the 
biomass and further purifying the wastewater [152] . Another in- 
teresting research approach for incorporating HTL-AP as a medium 
was for the growth of algae and a rice co-culture, which showed 
promising results for co-production of both food and energy [185] . 
However, the accumulation of heavy metals in rice grains was still 
a concern. 

There are some challenges for algae cultivation using HTL-AP. 
First,  HTL-AP  contains  a  large  number  of  inhibitors,  including 
organics and heavy metals (discussed in detail by a recent review 
paper [168] ). Hence, heavy dilutions of HTL-AP, commonly around 
100-times  dilution  ( Table  7 ),  are  required  to  avoid  growth  inhi- 
bition  caused  by  recalcitrant  compounds.  However,  the  concern 
with dilution is that this method would consume a lot of clean 
water  and  make  algae  cultivation  using  HTL-AP  economically 
unviable.  One  potential  solution  is  to  incorporate  low-strength 
wastewater [27] , such as the primary eﬄuent of a local municipal 
wastewater treatment plant [152] and mill cove wastewater [201] . 
However,  the  chemical  constituents  present  within  each  type  of 
low-strength wastewater will not be uniform, and properties will 
vary based on local conditions. Application of activated carbon has 
been  proven  as  a  way  to  signiﬁcantly  improve  algae  cultivation 
using  HTL-AP  due  to  the  adsorption  of  organic  nitrogen  and 
carbon [138] . Zhang et al. reported that proper biocrude-aqueous 
separation  (ethyl  ether  extraction)  could  relieve  the  potential 
toxicity of nitrogen-containing organic compounds to microalgae. 
A  biomass  yield  of  0.67  g/L  was  achieved  at  15-times  diluted 
HTL-AP,  which  was  the  highest  HTL-AP  concentration  reported 
for algae cultivation [154] . Using zeolites to adsorb inhibitors also 
promoted  the  tolerance  of  microorganisms  to  the  high  HTL-AP 
concentrations and increased biomass production by 67.2% [152] . 
However, the potential for commercial application of these meth- 
ods still needs to be further evaluated. In addition, although algae 
cultivation  demonstrates  a  high  N  recovery,  most  of  the  N  is 
inorganic, and no evidence can be found for the consumption of 
any organic nitrogen [144] . The recalcitrant and/or slow-degrading 
compounds  in  the  eﬄuent  from  algae  cultivation  contain  ni- 
trogen  heteroatoms  [216] .  This  was  further  conﬁrmed  by  Pham 
et  al.,  and  only  30%  of  the  toxicity,  which  mainly  resulted  from 
the  nitrogenous  organic  compounds,  was  removed  biologically 
by  recycling  Spirulina  HTL-AP  back  into  algal  cultivation  [182] . 
Hence, the integration of algae cultivation with other approaches 
to  remedy  the  inhibitors  and  enhance  the  nutrients  recovery  is 
required. 

4.2.2. Pure microbes cultivation 

HTL-AP has also been reported as a microbial growth medium, 
and the produced biomass could be the feedstock for biofuels and 
value-added  chemicals  production.  Compared  with  algae  cultiva- 
tion, microbes can more actively convert organic constituents via 
heterotrophic pathways. Different pure cultures have been inves- 
tigated  to  convert  the  organics  in  HTL-AP.  For  example,  Shende 
et al. cultivated a Enterobacter species in 15 vol.% HTL-AP derived 
from lignocellulosic biomass, and a maximum 9.4-fold increase in 
the  dry  cell  weight  was  observed  [224] .  The  Rhodococci  species 
was also reportedly able to convert 93.4% COD of HTL-AP within 
11 days [141] . Nelson et al., found that Escherichia coli and Pseu- 
domonas putida could grow using 10–40 vol.% aqueous phase from 
the liquefaction of the algae Nannochloropsis , and the best growth 
occurred  at  20  vol.%  [148] .  Jayakody  et  al.  demonstrated  that

aldehydes were the most inhibitory compounds in representative 
HTL-AP, and the inhibitors damaged the proteins which caused the 
protein derivatives to be misfolded and aggregated [210] . Although 
the challenges of toxicity hinder microbial conversion, effort s have 
been  made  to  use  engineered  aerobic  monocultures  or  designer 
consortia. The genome-modiﬁed Pseudomonas putida improved the 
tolerance towards thermochemical aqueous phase samples by up 
to 200-fold ( Fig. 12 ) [210] . The cultivation of pure microbes using 
HTL-AP  suggested  the  promising  potential  for  biomass  produc- 
tion  and  conversion  of  organics.  However,  the  complicated  and 
multivariate composition of HTL-AP needs further investigation to 
realize the application of this technology. 

4.3. Anaerobic fermentation 

Anaerobic fermentation is one of most cost-effective conversion 
technologies,  and  it  has  been  implemented  worldwide  for  com- 
mercial production of electricity, heat, and compressed natural gas 
[225] .  The  diversiﬁed  and  synergistic  characteristics  of  microbial 
communities  in  anaerobic  fermentation  make  this  methodology 
able  to  effectively  convert  HTL-AP.  Fermentation  primarily  in- 
cludes  two  main  approaches:  anaerobic  digestion  for  methane 
production and two-stage fermentation for simultaneous hydrogen 
and methane production. 

4.3.1. Anaerobic digestion for methane production 

Although HTL-AP is a new feedstock for methane production by 
anaerobic digestion, wastewater streams such as coal gasiﬁcation 
wastewater  [ 226 , 227] ,  cosmetic  wastewater  [228] ,  and  olive  mill 
wastewater [229] , which have a similar distribution of inhibitors 
(phenols and long chain acids), have been extensively studied. This 
indicates the promising potential of anaerobic digestion to effec- 
tively and eﬃciently valorize HTL-AP. However, the composition of 
HTL-AP is more complicated than the aforementioned wastewater. 
For  example,  abundant  nitrogen  organics,  furfurals,  and  inorgan- 
ics  are  present  in  HTL-AP  but  not  present  in  other  wastewater 
streams. Therefore, detailed investigation to understand the energy 
production  pathways  using  HTL-AP  for  anaerobic  digestion  is 
necessary. 

Table  8  summarizes  the  anaerobic  digestion  of  HTL-AP  us- 
ing  different  types  of  feedstock.  Previous  studies  indicated  that 

a  methane  yield  range  of  14–314  mL/g  COD  (average  value  of 
194 mL/g COD) was observed, and most studies reported a yield of 
around 200 mL/g COD which corresponded to an energy recovery 
of 57%. This suggested that most of the organics in HTL-AP could 
be converted to methane for energy production, which was also 
conﬁrmed  by  the  COD  removal  performance  ( Table  8 ).  However, 
there is a tradeoff between biocrude oil and methane production 
using model biomass as the HTL feedstock [230] . Obviously, HTL 
conditions should be screened and optimized based on biocrude 
oil  production  results,  since  this  is  the  main  contributing  factor 
for determining the energy recovery of the HTL process ( Fig. 13 ). 
Fig.  13  illustrates  that  300–350 °C  is  the  best  temperature  range 
to recover the greatest amount of energy from the HTL feedstock 
when  combined  with  anaerobic  digestion.  However,  in  some 
cases  (e.g.  carbohydrates-proteins  and  carbohydrates-proteins- 
lipids),  200 °C  seems  to  offer  the  highest  (or  second  highest) 
energy recovery from the biomass. Considering the energy needed 
to  heat  the  reactor,  it  is  estimated  that  200 °C  actually  may 
have a lower ECR. 

Inhibition of anaerobic digestion activity has been extensively 
reported  when  increased  fermentation  concentrations  of  HTL-AP 
were  utilized  [ 17 , 130 , 139] .  The  toxicity  threshold  of  anaerobic 
digestion  of  HTL-AP  derived  from  Spirulina  has  been  previously 
conducted  using  an  anaerobic  toxicity  assay  ( Fig.  14 ).  Signiﬁcant 
inhibition could be observed when the volumetric inclusion ratios 
of HTL-AP were higher than 5 vol.%, and a nearly complete inhi- 
bition  occurred  at  an  inclusion  ratio  higher  than  24  vol.%  [156] . 
Similar results were reported by Zhou et al., which showed that 
successful anaerobic digestion occurred at relatively low concentra- 
tions of HTL-AP (6.7 vol.%), producing a biogas yield of 0.5 ml/mg 
removed  and  an  energy  recovery  eﬃciency  of  53%.  However, 
COD 
higher  concentrations  (13.3  vol.%)  of  HTL-AP  had  an  inhibitory 
effect, as indicated by delayed, slowed, or even complete inhibition 
of biogas production [130] . 

Inhibition  during  anaerobic  digestion  of  HTL-AP  can  be  at- 
tributed  to  various  classes  of  organics  in  HTL-AP  ( Table  8 ), 
including furans, ketones, phenols, and N-heterocyclic compounds. 
These  compounds  are  known  to  be  inhibitors  to  microbes  of 
anaerobic  digestion.  Si  et  al.  revealed  the  transformations  of 
fermentation  inhibitors  and  microbial  response  ( Fig.  15 )  [170] . 
The complete degradation of furfural and 5-HMF, and the partial

were also reported as inhibitors to anaerobic digestion ( Table 8 ). 
Ammonia concentrations in HTL-AP of algae have been reported to 
reach up to 16 g/L ( Fig. 8 ), which is much higher than the reported 
ammonia inhibition concentration (2.8–11.0 g/L) [233] . Fernandez 
et al. reported a signiﬁcant inhibition towards methane production 
from  algae  HTL-AP  due  to  the  accumulation  of  chloride  in  the 
reactor [139] . Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Zn, and Pb found in HTL-AP can also 
inhibit  methane  production  [234] .  Notably,  synergistic  effects  of 
multi inhibitors in HTL-AP, in other words, the enhanced toxicity 
effect of one inhibitor in the presence of small amounts of another 
inhibitor, were reported. For example, Ni has been proven to be 
synergistic in Ni–Cu, Ni–Mo–Co, and Ni–Hg systems [234] . Similar 
synergistic relationships were also reported between phenol and 
nitrogen organics (pyridine) in which pyridine degradation would 
be  inhibited  when  the  phenol  concentration  was  higher  than 
400 mg/L [235] . Pham et al. reported that although all 9 nitrogen 
organic  compounds  in  the  Spirulina  HTL-AP  were  not  cytotoxic 
to  mammalian  cells  at  their  detected  concentration,  a  mixture 
of  them  expressed  a  synergistic  cytotoxicity  effect  [182] .  Hence, 
a  proper  strategy  that  removes  inhibitors  one-by-one  should  be 
proposed to avoid such synergistic effects. For example, Yang et al. 
reported  that  the  complete  conversion  of  phenols  signiﬁcantly 
improved biodegradability of HTL-AP by 33%; however, only a lim- 
ited conversion (21.7%) of N-heterocyclic compounds was observed 
[129] . 

The  formation  of  inhibitors  during  the  HTL  process  is  also 
highly dependent on the feedstock. The highest reported methane 
yield  (314  mL/g  COD)  resulted  from  HTL-AP  generated  from  lig- 
nocellulose biomass [ 22 , 161] . HTL-AP from lignocellulose biomass 
mainly  consisted  of  organic  acids  and  sugars  converted  from 
cellulose  and  hemicellulose  which  can  be  easily  converted  by 
anaerobic  microbes.  In  contrast,  the  HTL-AP  from  sludge,  algae, 
and livestock manure showed a lower methane yield (14–313 mL/g 
COD) ( Table 8 ). Posmanik et al. further conﬁrmed the relationship 
between the HTL feedstock selection and methane production by 
using  model  compounds.  This  study  concluded  that  the  HTL  of 
protein-rich  biomass  produced  heavy  nitrogenous  polymers  and 
non-polar nitrogenous compounds, such as pyridine and pyrazine, 
resulting  in  a  reduced  biodegradability  of  HTL-AP  [230] .  The 
operational conditions of HTL were also reported to contribute to 
the  methane  production  potential  for  the  anaerobic  digestion  of

assays. The negative values indicated that the HTL-AP was considered non-toxic at 
such low inclusion ratios. Adapted from [156] . 

degradation  (54.0–74.6%)  of  organic  nitrogen  and  phenolic  com- 
pounds  was  observed.  The  aromatic  compounds  and  nitrogen 
organics were considered to be the primary inhibitors. The great 
stability  caused  by  the  resonance  energy  of  the  aromatic  ring 
and  the  inertness  of  C-C  and  C-H  bonds  in  these  hydrocarbons 
make  aromatic  compounds  recalcitrant  to  biodegradation.  The 
incorporation of protein-rich feedstocks like algae and municipal 
wastes lead to the production of a HTL-AP with a high content of 
N-heterocyclic compounds [ 145 , 146] . The conversion of eﬃciency 
of  N-heterocyclic  compounds  during  anaerobic  fermentation  is 
relatively  slow  and  thus  less  attractive  for  full-scale  application 
[232] . This was further conﬁrmed by Shanmugam et al., in which 
high levels of nitrogen organics in HTL-AP signiﬁcantly decreased 
the methane yield [200] . Although pyrazine, pyridine, and pyrro- 
lidinone  can  be  anaerobically  fermented,  a  heavy  dilution  and 
a  long  treating  time  need  to  be  incorporated  [ 139 , 156] .  These 
inhibitors may also suppress acetogenesis [ 17 , 156 , 170 , 204] , which 
is  a  rate  limiting  step  during  anaerobic  digestion.  As  a  result,  a 
signiﬁcant accumulation of propionate, butyrate, and valerate was 
observed. The inorganics (ammonia and chloride salts) in HTL-AP

HTL-AP. Tommaso et al. reported that increasing the HTL temper- 
ature from 260 to 320 °C signiﬁcantly beneﬁted the production of 
methane [17] . Further, Chen et al. conﬁrmed that both temperature 
and retention time of HTL affected the anaerobic biodegradability 
of rice straw HTL-AP. These two factors were reported to change 
the  distribution  of  inhibitors  (furans,  phenols,  etc.)  and  easily 
biodegradable organics (sugars and volatile fatty acids) [22] . How- 
ever, contradictory ﬁndings have also been reported which stated 
that  an  increased  hydrothermal  temperature  and  residence  time 
negatively  impacted  methane  yields  of  HTL-AP,  stemming  from 
the  production  of  recalcitrant  compounds  production,  including 
humic  acid,  melanoidins,  nitrogen  heterocyclics,  and  phenols 
[164] . 

To  enhance  anaerobic  digestion  of  HTL-AP,  various  treatment 
methods  have  been  investigated  ( Table  8 ).  Pretreatment  and  ad- 
dition of activated carbon have been used to adsorb the organic 
inhibitors, including phenol derivatives, furans, and nitrogen con- 
taining  compounds.  Activated  carbon  addition  was  reported  to 
improve the methane yield (13–298%), shorten the lag-phase, and 
allow anaerobic digestion to occur at a high concentration. Zeolite 
addition and struvite recovery were also applied to remove ammo- 
nia to circumvent inhibition during anaerobic digestion of the HTL- 
AP derived from algae. An increased methane yield (5-117%) and 
shortened lag-phase was observed in these studies. Partial oxida- 
2 oxidation has also been 
tion including ozone treatment and H 

2 O 

proven to effectively increase the methane yield and organics con- 
version, but an increase of the lag-phase was also observed which 
suggested that potential recalcitrant compounds may be produced 
as secondary by-products. Co-digestion with an easily biodegrad- 
able feedstock to dilute the inhibitors has been utilized as another 
strategy.  Si  et  al.  previously  added  glucose  during  the  anaerobic 
digestion of HTL-AP [161] . Fernandez et al. found that a methane 
yield of 244–313 mL/g COD was achieved using 20–40% (vol.%) of 
HTL-AP mixed with manure [139] . Microbes have been shown to 
play a critical role in methane production when using HTL-AP as 
a feedstock. Currently, there is limited information regarding the 
function  of  microbes  during  the  anaerobic  digestion  of  HTL-AP. 
Only a few studies have investigated the microbe structures dur- 
ing anaerobic digestion of HTL-AP generated from lignocellulosic 
biomass  [ 21 , 22 , 157 , 170] .  Bio-augmentation  is  a  method  which 
involves the addition of microbe cultures to accelerate the rate of 
degradation of recalcitrant compounds. Using bio-augmentation to 
engineer the microbial communities could be another method to 
improve the methane production. For example, acetogenesis was 
considered  as  the  rate-limiting  step  during  anaerobic  digestion 
of  HTL-AP  ( Table  8 ),  and  bio-augmentation  of  acetogens  could 
be  a  meaningful  manner  to  address  this  kinetic  issue.  Directed 
evolution with long-term operation is another promising approach.

acetogens after two batches of experiments, a shortened lag-phase 
and an enhancement of the conversion of acids during anaerobic 
digestion  of  HTL-AP  was  achieved  [21] .  Application  of  high-rate 
anaerobic reactors could improve treatment eﬃciency due to the 
increased concentration of microbes and an increase in the solid 
retention  time.  Si  et  al.  investigated  the  anaerobic  digestion  of 
cornstalk HTL-AP in high rate reactors, and the detoxiﬁcation bac- 
teria families such as Geobacter sp., Desulfovibrio sp., Pseudomonas 
sp.,  and  Bacillus  sp.  were  reported  to  increase  in  concentra- 
tion  in  response  to  the  feed  shift  from  synthetic  wastewater  to 
HTL-AP [170] . 

It has been reported that over 40% of the organics ram in the 
HTL-AP  after  anaerobic  digestion  ( Table  8 ).  Thus,  better  under- 
standing of the fate of organics within HTL-AP during anaerobic 
digestion would be helpful to evaluate the inﬂuence of anaerobic 
digestion  on  the  environment.  Chen  et  al.  discovered  that  high 
molecular weight organics (MW > 10 0 0) in HTL-AP were diﬃcult 
to  convert  via  anaerobic  digestion  [157] .  Si  et  al.  elucidated  the 
reaction  pathways  of  the  recalcitrant  organics  during  anaerobic 
digestion by analyzing macro- and micro-molecules ( Fig. 16 ) [21] . 
Although organic acids are easily converted to methane, acetoge- 
nesis would be inhibited with the increase of cyclic compounds. 
Anaerobic  digestion  has  been  previously  reported  to  reduce  the 
molecular size of nitrogen-containing macro-molecules in HTL-AP; 
however, subsequent minimization of these compounds was found 
to  be  cumbersome  [21] .  These  high  molecular  weight  organics 
were believed to be the polymers (or oligomers) of HTL interme- 
diates  and  the  toxicity  of  these  nitrogen-containing  compounds 
need to be further characterized. Luckily, the produced recalcitrant 
compounds  can  be  adsorbed  by  GAC  and  a  93.3–96.8%  organics 
removal  has  been  reported  [21] .  However,  it  is  diﬃcult  to  bio- 
logically  regenerate  the  GAC  after  being  used  as  an  adsorption 
agent. Thus, the development of biochar from cheap sources (e.g. 
biowaste)  to  replace  costly  commercial  GAC  is  recommended. 
Combining this method with other treatment approaches (aerobic) 
would also be an effective treatment approach. This strategy has 
been proven during the conversion of dyes, which demonstrated 
that  the  nitrogen  organics  were  effectively  transformed  using 
a  sequential  anaerobic  and  aerobic  system  [236] .  However,  this 
technique  needs  further  evaluation  since  aerobic  systems  are 
expensive and energetically costly. In general, recent studies have 
indicated  that  anaerobic  digestion  is  a  promising  and  mature 

technology to convert most organics in the HTL-AP, and the pro- 
duced methane could be recycled back into the HTL paradigm for 
heating the HTL reactor. Although dilution of HTL-AP is required 
for anaerobic conversion, it is much less than the dilution required 
for algae cultivation. In particular, anaerobic digestion (with GAC 
addition) could be conducted while only utilizing 2-times diluted 
HTL-AP. 

4.3.2. Two-stage fermentation for hydrogen and methane production 

HTL-AP containing sugars [167] and glycerol [ 26 , 144 , 148] could 
be the ideal feedstock for hydrogen production [237] . In addition, 
HTL could be considered as a sterilization process due to the high 
reaction  temperature  employed  during  thermochemical  conver- 
sion. This feature set offers the beneﬁt of controlling biohydrogen 
production, since high reaction temperatures prevents the growth 
of  hydrogen-consuming  microbes  in  the  feedstock.  The  products 
after  biohydrogen  production,  mainly  consisting  of  organic  acids 
and alcohols, could then be the feedstock for subsequent methane 
production. Establishing a two-stage fermentation system for both 
hydrogen and methane production could realize this goal. This is 
important because the produced gas, a mixture of hydrogen and 
methane  (hythane),  is  respected  as  a  clean  and  eﬃcient  vehicle 
fuel [238] . 

Compared  with  conventional  anaerobic  digestion  (one-stage 
fermentation), two-stage fermentation leads to an increased the- 
oretical  energy  recovery  (by  10–12%)  [237] .  More  importantly, 
two-stage  fermentation  has  demonstrated  a  strengthened  bio- 
chemical  process  when  handling  complicated  substrates.  During 
two-stage  fermentation,  ﬁrst,  hydrogen  production  (ﬁrst  stage) 
plays a role as a buffer and detoxiﬁcation agent for the methane 
production process. Liu et al. reported that furfural and 5-HMF in 
thermally treated cornstalk (below 1 g/L) were almost completely 
degraded during biohydrogen production, which suggested that hy- 
drogen fermentation could be a detoxiﬁcation step [239] . The toxic 
compounds principally obstructed the activities of the sensitive ob- 
ligate hydrogen-producing acetogens and methanogenic portions of 
the digester population [234] .The acidogens (for hydrogen produc- 
tion) are also believed to be more resistant to heavy metal toxicity 
than  methanogens  [234] .  However,  one  study  pointed  out  that 
furanic (5-HMF and furfural) and phenolic compounds were found 
to  be  stronger  inhibitors  of  microbial  activity  for  hydrogen  fer- 
mentation than the full anaerobic digestion process [240] . Second, 

26

hydrogen fermentation was reported to have a positive effect on 
subsequent  biomethane  production.  Methane  production  in  the 
two-stage  system  led  to  enhanced  acetogenesis  and  an  enriched 
acetate-utilizing microbial community [241] . The detoxiﬁcation of 
hydrogen fermentation and the strengthened methane production 
in  two-stage  fermentation  was  also  veriﬁed  when  compared 
to  conventional  anaerobic  digestion  using  HTL-AP  derived  from 
cornstalk as a substrate [161] . However, hydrogen production was 
fully  stopped  with  an  increase  in  the  concentration  of  HTL-AP. 
This  could  be  attributed  to  the  metabolic  shift  from  hydrogen- 
producing pathways (e.g. acetate and butyrate) to non-hydrogen- 
producing pathways (e.g. lactate, ethanol and propionate) caused 
by  toxic  compounds  in  HTL-AP  [240] .  A  recent  study  proved 
that a hydrogen yield of 29.3 mL/g COD and a methane yield of 
254.3 mL/g COD could be achieved from HTL-AP using two-stage 
fermentation, and further techno-economic and sensitivity analysis 
supported  the  feasibility  of  this  approach  [242] .  However,  most 
current  studies  incorporating  two-stage  fermentation  still  only 
operate at the bench scale. This is due to the fact that there are 
still some unsolved challenges for upscaling the hythane system, 
including maintaining the stability of the biohydrogen reactor and 
further  controlling  and  integrating  the  two-stage  fermentation 
system [243] . 4.4 Bioelectrochemical systems 

Compared with conventional biological conversion technologies, 
bioelectrochemical  processes  including  electrochemical  oxidation 
and electrochemical reduction are also effective strategies for the 
conversion  of  recalcitrant  compounds  to  electricity  or  gas  [244] . 
Bioelectrochemical  systems,  including  microbial  fuel  cells  (MFC) 
and  microbial  electrolysis  cells  (MEC),  depend  on  the  positive 
(MFC)  or  negative  (MEC)  difference  of  electricity  generated  and 
the Gibbs free energy change of the corresponding reaction. 

4.4.1. Microbial fuel cell (MFC) 

Phenols,  furan  derivatives,  and  N-heterocyclic  compounds, 
which were proven to be the predominant toxic and recalcitrant 
compounds  in  HTL-AP,  have  been  extensively  investigated  in 
bioelectrochemical systems [245–247] . In particular, N-heterocyclic 
compounds  were  eﬃciently  converted  in  bioelectrochemical  sys- 
tems, whereas only a limited conversion of these compounds was 
observed during anaerobic digestion and algae cultivation. Zhang 
et al. reported a 95% removal of pyridine in a graphite-packed MFC 
within 24 h of operation, and the eﬃciency reported in this study 
was much higher than reported using anaerobic and aerobic con- 
ditions ( Fig. 17 ) [246] . Further research conﬁrmed the possibility of 
electricity production with pyridine, quinolone, and indole using 
two-compartment  MFC  reactors,  and  the  maximum  degradation 
eﬃciency  of  these  substrates  and  COD  removal  amounted  up  to

tion, and aerobic biodegradation systems. Reprinted from [246] with permission

nure HTL-AP. Adapted from [23] . 

90% and 88%, respectively [248] . For HTL-AP, Liu et al. reported a 
carbon nanotubes-constructed ﬁxed-bed MFC for continuous elec- 
tricity generation using HTL-AP derived from cornstalk, and a max- 
imum power density of 680 mW/m 3  and a COD removal of over 
80% was achieved [24] . 

4.4.2. Microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) 

MEC  is  another  bioelectrochemical  system  which  could  eﬃ- 
ciently  convert  recalcitrant  compounds  in  HTL-AP  and  produce 
hydrogen  without  the  limitation  of  thermodynamics.  Shen  et  al. 
found that MEC could convert furfural, HMF, dimethyl phthalate, 
and  diethyl  phthalate  in  the  HTL-AP  generated  from  cornstalk, 
and a hydrogen production rate of 3.92 mL/L/d could be achieved 
[203] . A two-chamber ﬁxed-bed MEC was also used for convert- 
ing swine manure HTL-AP ( Fig. 18 ), and excellent performance in 
organics removal ( > 90%) and hydrogen production rate (168.01 ±
7.01 mL/L/d) was achieved [23] . 

Although  bioelectrochemical  systems  demonstrated  feasibility 
for converting HTL-AP to electricity or hydrogen, bioelectrochem- 
ical systems presently need intensive efforts devoted to realizing 
full-scale  commercial  application  in  terms  of  cost-effectiveness 
and sustainability. In particular the following areas of study within 
this  ﬁeld  need  to  be  emphasized:  1)  Decrease  the  startup  time, 
which usually takes a couple of weeks to months, 2) develop new, 
durable,  and  low-cost  electrode  materials  with  a  high  activity, 
conductivity,  and  stability,  3)  improve  the  eﬃciency  at  process 
scale-up,  and  4)  develop  a  low-cost  proton  exchange  membrane 
[249–251] . 

5. Hydrothermal conversion of HTL-AP 

5.1. Hydrothermal gasiﬁcation 

One  of  the  thermochemical  methods  of  valorizing  HTL-AP  by 
transformation  organic  matter  into  a  usable  product  is  through 
hydrothermal gasiﬁcation. Generally speaking, hydrothermal gasi- 
ﬁcation utilizes high reaction temperatures ( > 400 °C) and a variety 
of homogenous and heterogeneous catalysts to chemically reform 
the bonds in organic compounds into basic chemical constituents: 
hydrogen,  methane,  carbon  dioxide,  and  carbon  monoxide  [26] . 
Gasiﬁcation  is  of  particular  interest  because  it  has  the  potential 
to  convert  over  99%  of  the  organic  compounds  in  the  HTL-AP 
into gaseous products [252] . There are three primary factors that 
inﬂuence the eﬃcacy of gasiﬁcation as a treatment methodology 
for HTL-AP valorization: reaction temperature, retention time, and 
selection of catalyst.

27 

Fig. 19.  Reaction diagram of the reactions present within the gasiﬁcation of HTL-AP. 

5.1.1. Primary factors inﬂuencing gasiﬁcation 

The  desired  reaction  products  conducted  through  the  gasiﬁ- 
cation  of  HTL-AP  can  be  heavily  inﬂuenced  by  the  selection  of 
the  temperature,  retention  time,  and  the  catalyst.  Therefore,  the 
reaction conditions should be selected and catered to the desired 
reaction products. 

Temperature is generally the main inﬂuencing parameter that 
has a direct inﬂuence on the production of the reaction product. 
One study found that increasing the reaction temperature of gasi- 
ﬁcation from 250 °C to 520 °C increased the hydrogen gas fraction 
from  approximately  21%  to  38%,  but  then  the  hydrogen  fraction 
decreased to 32% as the temperature increased to 700 °C [253] . This 
trend was also corroborated by a previous study gasifying HTL-AP 
from human feces which found that as the severity of the reaction 
increased  from  2.6  to  3.1,  the  mass  of  hydrogen  increased  from 
1.8 mg to 9.5 mg but then decreased thereafter to 7.0 mg as the 
reaction severity further increased to 10.8 [26] . This trend has also 
been corroborated by multiple previous studies utilizing cellulose 
and polyvinyl alcohol wastewater as a gasiﬁcation feedstock [254–
256] . This trend is attributed to not only the methanation reaction, 
which produces methane at the expense of hydrogen and carbon 
monoxide at higher reaction temperatures, but also the water-gas 
shift reaction, since both reactions are enhanced at higher reaction 
temperatures and pressures. Therefore, the competitive nature of 
these two reactions between 30 0–60 0 °C can inﬂuence the selec- 
tivity of gaseous products in this temperature range. Temperature 
is  also  an  inﬂuencing  factor  because  it  alters  the  molecular  and 
chemical structure of water. This in turn leads to poor intra- and 
inter-molecular  hydrogen  bonding  characteristics  of  water  which 
results  in  the  decomposition  of  biomass  [257] .  Previous  studies 
have demonstrated that above the critical point of water, reactions 
are shifted from covalent/ionic to radical, therefore the free radical 
mechanism is heavily favored which augments the production of 
gaseous products. This in turn also favors the water-gas shift reac- 
tion, leading to higher accumulations of hydrogen and carbon diox- 
ide  through  the  consumption  of  the  produced  carbon  monoxide 
[ 258 , 259] . Steam reforming can also occur at higher temperatures 
due to its mildly endothermic characteristics, which preferentially 

favors  the  production  of  hydrogen  and  carbon  dioxide  [260] . 
The  general  reaction  pathway  of  macromolecules  to  gasiﬁcation 
products is illustrated in Fig. 19 . 

Retention time also has an evident impact on the gas compo- 
sition. A previous study noted that a longer retention time favors 
the  production  of  methane  and  carbon  monoxide  by  promoting 
thermal  cracking  reactions  at  elevated  temperatures.  Further, 
higher methane concentrations can also result from the secondary 
methanation reactions which only occur at suﬃciently long reten- 
tion times [261–263] . A longer retention time not only inﬂuences 
the gas composition, it also has an evident impact on the overall 
gas  production.  Gong  et  al.  demonstrated  that  as  the  retention 
time increased from 30 min to 90 min that the gas yield increased 
from  1.2  mol/kg  to  1.7  mol/kg  [258] .  Another  study  conﬁrmed 
this  observation  using  lactose  as  a  gasiﬁcation  feedstock  which 
represented  a  model  compound  of  dairy  industry  eﬄuent  and 
demonstrated that the gas yield increased from 1.19 L/g at 30 s 
to 1.69 g/L at 60 s and 1.68 L/g at 75 s [262] . Thus, a minimum 
retention time is needed to ensure the complete conversion of or- 
ganic material into gaseous products; however, the gas production 
tends to plateau at longer retention times. If hydrogen is the target 
objective  for  gas  production,  research  has  shown  that  residence 
time will increase the hydrogen yield up to a maximum, but after 
reaching  an  apex  no  signiﬁcant  improvement  will  be  observed 
[264] . Therefore, there is a tradeoff when it comes to maximizing 
gas production and maximizing the content of hydrogen. Further, 
as  the  retention  time  increases,  the  water-gas  shift  reaction,  re- 
forming reactions, and the methanation reactions are all enhanced. 
Thus,  at  higher  temperatures  and  retention  times,  the  gaseous 
reaction  products  often  react  amongst  themselves  to  produce 
methane through hydrogenation and methanation reactions [259] . 
A  previous  study  also  noted  that  the  feed  concentration  could 
drastically  impact  the  gas  composition.  Utilizing  glycerol  as  a 
gasiﬁcation  feedstock,  one  study  found  that  as  the  feed  concen- 
tration increased from 5 wt.% to 40 wt.% the content of hydrogen 
decreased from 6.5 mol/g glycerol to 2 mol/g glycerol while the 
methane  content  increased  from  0.3  mol/g  glycerol  to  1.0  mol/g 
glycerol  [261] .  Since  water  is  a  primary  factor  inﬂuencing  the 

28

hydrogen content, a greater feed concentration would lead to the 
production of less hydrogen gas while shifting the product distri- 
bution to the production of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and 
methane. 

3 [269–272] , KHCO 

Incorporation of catalysts in the gasiﬁcation process can pref- 
erentially shift the production of speciﬁc gaseous products and aid 
in the conversion of organic matter. Catalysts can be classiﬁed into 
two  broad  categories:  heterogeneous  catalysts  and  homogeneous 
catalysts. Homogeneous catalysts are able to dissolve in the reac- 
tion medium, whereas heterogeneous catalysts are in a phase dif- 
ferent than that of the reaction medium. Typical homogeneous cat- 
alysts employed in gasiﬁcation processes involve alkali derivatives, 
3 [269] , and 
2 CO 
including NaOH [ 26 , 265–268] , K 
KOH [ 256 , 267 , 269] . Previous studies indicated that homogeneous 
catalysts tend to substantially increase the concentration of hydro- 
gen and carbon monoxide in the gaseous product by improving the 
water-gas shift reaction [263] ( Fig. 19 ). However, one drawback of 
the use of homogeneous catalysts includes the low gasiﬁcation ef- 
ﬁciency associated with these catalysts. This is due to the fact that 
catalysts such as NaOH and KOH can form formate and carbonate 
complexes  which  precipitate  out  of  solution  consuming  carbon 
dioxide  and  carbon  monoxide.  Thus,  carbon  is  ﬁrst  gasiﬁed  to 
carbon dioxide and then captured in the aqueous phase [ 269 , 273] . 
Moreover,  besides  leading  to  a  poor  gasiﬁcation  eﬃciency,  ho- 
mogeneous  catalysts  pose  large  problems  for  recovery  because 
they are diﬃcult to isolate from the feedstock after the reaction, 
therefore homogeneous catalysts are not viewed as a catalyst but 
instead as a reactant additive [273] . 

2 AlO 

Contrary  to  homogeneous  catalysts,  heterogeneous  catalysts 
can  be  separated  from  the  reaction  medium.  However,  due  to 
their  incorporation  of  transition  metals,  heterogeneous  catalysts 
tend to incur a substantial monetary cost and can be deactivated 
due  to  poisoning,  coking,  and  sintering  by  organic  material  or 
heteroatoms during gasiﬁcation processes. Thus, catalyst recovery 
and reactivation techniques need to be investigated and employed 
in order to reduce the additional pecuniary costs associated with 
the inclusion of heterogeneous catalysts. Among all the transition 
metal catalysts selected for gasiﬁcation purposes, Ru and Ni tend 
to  be  the  most  commonly  employed.  Ni  derivatives  primarily 
include NiO [ 274 , 275] and Ni 
3 [ 258 , 276 , 277] . Previous studies 
have  indicated  that  Ni  catalysts  promote  the  tar  cracking  and 
steam  reforming  reactions  [276] .  Furthermore,  a  previous  study 
demonstrated that Ni catalysts tend to favor the methanation reac- 
tions, leading to reduced hydrogen yields and increased methane 
yields. This is due to the fact that Ni is an effective hydrogenation 
catalyst which decomposes organic matter into carbon monoxide 
and  hydrogen  which  is  subsequently  transformed  into  methane 
via the methanation reactions at higher feed concentrations [258] . 
Further,  Ni  catalysts  have  a  strong  ability  to  cleave  C-C  bonds, 
which result in a high carbon conversion eﬃciency (CCE) and aid 
in the production of methane [269] . Another study also reported 
that  Ni-derivatives  have  the  ability  to  cleave  O-H,  C-C,  and  C-H 
bonds,  thereby  decomposing  recalcitrant  tar  derivatives  as  well 
as  long-chain  oxygenates  into  gases  [278] .  However,  the  speciﬁc 
mechanism and trends for the production of gaseous products via 
Ni  catalysts  has  been  met  with  contention.  One  previous  study 
conversely found that Ni catalyzed the steam-reforming reaction 
resulting in the promotion of hydrogen at the expense of methane 
[ 279 , 280] . Thus, the feedstock and reaction conditions need to be 
considered when employing Ni-derivatives to cater the production 
of gaseous product to the desired gas. Ni catalysts can produce an 
appreciable amount of methane when a high feed concentration 
and mild reaction conditions are employed (30 0–60 0 °C) for gasiﬁ- 
cation, but hydrogen production is favored when more severe reac- 
tion conditions are utilized ( > 700 °C) and when lower feed concen- 
trations are utilized [273] . This is due to the fact that the water-gas 

shift reaction and steam reforming reactions are heavily favored at 
high temperatures whereas methanation reactions are favored at 
milder temperatures. 

Ni  catalysts  are  not  only  favorable  due  to  their  high  selec- 
tivity  of  gaseous  products,  they  also  enhance  the  eﬃciency  of 
the  conversion  of  organic  matter  into  gaseous  products.  Further, 
the  eﬃciency  of  Ni-derivatives  is  also  aided  in  part  by  catalyst 
supports.  In  particular,  one  study  found  that  the  CCE  and  the 
hydrogen  conversion  eﬃciency  (HCE)  all  improved  for  catalytic 
versus  non-catalytic  gasiﬁcation;  however,  the  CCE  and  HCE 
amongst  the  Ni/zeolites  exhibited  the  trend:  Ni/HY  >  Ni/MCM- 
41 > Ni/H β > Ni/HZSM-5 > Ni/SAPO, where the zeolite supports 
2 O = 0.5%, 0.8%), MCM-41 (Si = 100%, 50%), H β-type, 
were HY (Na 
3 = 50:1, 150:1, 170:1), SAPO-11 [260] . Further, 
HZSM-5 (SiO 
2 /Al 
all catalyst supports enhanced the hydrogen production between 
1.7–2.3 times versus non-catalytic runs. However, a large problem 
with Ni catalysts regardless of catalyst support inclusion is the sus- 
ceptibility of Ni-derivatives to deactivation. Previous studies have 
noted that the main cause of deactivation can come from the ad- 
herence of amorphous carbon to the surface of the catalyst which 
in  turn  causes  insuﬃcient  contact  between  Ni  and  the  biomass 
[281] . Moreover, supercritical conditions ( > 374 °C, > 22 MPa) have 
also  been  shown  to  readily  deactivate  the  catalyst  due  to  harsh 
sintering. Thus, Ni has not been shown to be a reliable or effective 
catalyst after recycling [282] .

Ruthenium  is  another  commonly  employed  transition  metal 
which  can  catalyze  the  decomposition  of  organic  matter  in 
wastewater.  One  study  found  that  RuCl 
3  and  Ru/C  showed  the 
highest selectivity of all catalysts for selectively isolating hydrogen, 
leading  to  a  44.5%  and  38.5  (mol.%)  composition  of  hydrogen 
for  the  supercritical  water  gasiﬁcation  of  a  kenaf  plant  [283] .  A 
previous study also noted the ability for Ru to enhance hydrogen 
production at low temperatures but enhance methane production 
at high temperatures. In particular, it was found that the hydro- 
gen  concentration  in  the  output  gas  decreased  when  employing 
Ru/Al 
3 ranging from 5.9–12.0% at 400 °C and then ranging from 
4.6–11.0%  at  600 °C  [284] .  Another  study  veriﬁed  this  trend  by 
3  produced  a  greater  amount  of  hy- 
demonstrating  that  Ni/Al 
drogen when compared to RuTiO 
2 [285] . Both Ni and Ru catalysts 
have been shown to promote the water-gas shift reaction, but Ru 
has been shown to enhance the methanation reaction to a greater 
extent  than  Ni  [286] .  Ru/Al 
3  has  also  been  shown  to  be  able 
to convert recalcitrant compounds currently present in numerous 
wastewater studies. Speciﬁcally, Ru/Al 
3 was able to promote the 
hydrogenation of phenol to cyclohexanol, subsequently leading to 
a ring-opening to hexanone or hexenol. Thus, ruthenium catalysts 
have the potential to catalytically convert some of the recalcitrant 
compounds in wastewater, thereby inhibiting the formation of tar 
and  char  from  gasiﬁcation  and  also  leading  to  a  cleaner  water 
which can be discharged or utilized for algae growth [286] .

5.1.2. Gasiﬁcation as a valorization technique 

Recently, gasiﬁcation has been utilized in a few preceding stud- 
ies  to  valorize  the  organic  matter  trapped  within  HTL-AP  and 
various  wastewater  feedstocks  while  concomitantly  treating  the 
wastewater for environmental disposal, algae growth, etc. Table 9 
summarizes the recent progress on studies utilizing gasiﬁcation as 
a means of producing hydrogen, methane, and reducing the COD 
and TOC of HTL-AP and various wastewater eﬄuents. 

Due  to  the  low  content  of  total  solids  in  wastewater,  many 
studies have set out to produce a rich hydrogen gas by employing 
non-catalytic  gasiﬁcation  as  a  treatment  technique.  Duan  et  al. 
demonstrated  that  the  composition  of  the  HTL-AP  greatly  im- 
pacted  the  resulting  gas  distribution.  In  particular,  under  600 °C 
with  a  120  minute  retention  time  the  highest  hydrogen  content 
was 1.08 mmol hydrogen/g HTL-AP [77] . However, hydrogen yields

ranged from 21–58% in this study even though the reaction con- 
ditions  were  the  same  for  different  types  of  HTL-AP  ( Table  9 ). 
This could be attributed to the presence of inorganic salts in the 
HTL-AP,  as  these  compounds  may  act  as  a  gasiﬁcation  catalyst 
leading to a higher gasiﬁcation eﬃciency and a greater production 
of hydrogen. Therefore, the TOC and chemical composition of the 
HTL-AP heavily impact not only the production of gas but also the 
quality of the gaseous products. Cherad et al. also conﬁrmed that 
a lower organic loading rate is beneﬁcial for hydrogen production. 
This  study  found  that  when  the  loading  rate  decreased  from 
11,0 0 0  mg/L  to  2,0 0 0  mg/L  the  hydrogen  yield  increased  signif- 
icantly from 3.31 to 23.65 mol/kg for the gasiﬁcation of HTL-AP 
derived  from  Chlorella  vulgaris  [25] .  Therefore,  an  appreciable 
amount of hydrogen gas can be produced with a low concentra- 
tion of organics in the HTL-AP; however, at higher concentrations 
of  organics  the  incorporation  of  catalysts  should  be  considered. 
Multiple previous studies have noted that a low retention time is 
beneﬁcial for hydrogen production. One study found that at 500 °C 
and a retention time of 35 s a 33.9% and 21.1% mole fraction of 
hydrogen  from  winery  wastewater  and  wine  grape  slurry  could 
be  produced,  respectively.  This  study  found  that  minimizing  the 
retention time is essential to maximizing hydrogen production in 
order to suppress the methanation reaction which is favored at a 
high retention time [287] . A previous study also noted that a high 
temperature and low retention time is beneﬁcial for hydrogen pro- 
duction. Speciﬁcally, gasiﬁcation of olive mill wastewater generated 
the greatest hydrogen output (10.8 vol.%) at a temperature of 600 °C 
and a retention time of 30 s and decreased (9.7 vol.%) when the 
retention time was increased to 120 s [288] . 

Although the incorporation of a catalyst incurs additional costs, 
it also drastically increases the hydrogen yield. One study found 
that both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts could increase 
the hydrogen yield substantially. For the HTL-AP derived from hu- 
man  feces,  incorporation  of  a  heterogeneous  catalyst  (Raney  Ni) 
and a homogeneous catalyst (NaOH) increased the hydrogen yield 
by  nearly  30%  and  34%,  respectively,  compared  to  non-catalytic 
gasiﬁcation conducted at 400 °C and a 60 min retention time [26] . 
However, these catalysts only resulted in slight reductions in the 
COD and ammonia concentration of HTL–AP, leading to tradeoffs 
between  hydrogen  production  and  organic  matter  conversion. 
Another  study  concluded  that  utilizing  1.5  M  NaOH  was  able 
to  increase  the  hydrogen  yield  from  the  HTL-AP  generated  from 
Chlorella by 91% compared to non-catalytic runs [25] . It should also 
be  noted  that  one  study  found  that  the  incorporation  of  a  KOH 
catalyst increased the HCE substantially up to 108% [253] ( Table 9 ). 

Since  water  acts  as  the  reactant  medium,  water  is  also  able  to 
be  converted  into  hydrogen,  leading  to  HCE  values  greater  than 
100%.  Finally,  one  study  conducting  alkaline  gasiﬁcation  using 
NaOH  found  that  up  to  30  vol.%  of  hydrogen  could  be  pro- 
duced  from  pharmaceutical  wastewater  at  a  temperature  as  low 
as 450 °C [289] . 

For non-catalytic gasiﬁcation, temperatures below 600 °C have 
been  shown  to  produce  an  appreciable  amount  of  methane.  A 
previous study gasifying olive mill wastewater noted that methane 
production increased from 1.1 mol.% at 400 °C up to 34.8 mol.% at 
550 °C and then decreased substantially to 23.3% when the tem- 
perature increased to 600 °C [288] . This could be attributed to the 
declined strength of methanation reactions at higher temperatures 
and the shift to H 
2 /CO production at the expense of methane. A 
previous  study  analyzed  HTL-AP  model  compounds  (acetic  acid, 
1-butanol,  acetol,  and  glucose)  on  the  overall  methane  yield  of 
non-catalytic gasiﬁcation. In this study, it was concluded that gasi- 
ﬁcation of acetic acid and 1-butanol led to the highest methane 
content of 44.3 vol.% and 51.0 vol.%, respectively, at a temperature 
of  700 °C  and  a  ﬂow  rate  of  1.0  L/h  [293] .  This  study  also  con- 
cluded that the feedstock concentration was positively correlated 
with the methane content. As the feedstock content in this study 
increased from 2.5 wt.% to 10 wt.% the methane yield increased 
from 30.1% to 41.7% while the hydrogen concentration decreased 
from 7.0 to 5.1 vol.%. The feedstock composition may signiﬁcantly 
impact  non-catalytic  gasiﬁcation  results  for  the  production  of 
methane. Duan et al. noted that gasiﬁcation results varied signif- 
icantly for the gasiﬁcation of microalgae and macroalgae HTL-AP 
feedstocks.  In  particular,  this  study  noted  that  under  constant 
reaction conditions HTL-AP derived from macroalgae consistently 
produced a greater amount of methane than hydrogen whereas for 
microalgae  the  trend  was  not  always  consistent  [77] .  This  could 
have been attributed to the greater amount of organic matter in 
the HTL-AP of microalgae (~23.9 9 g/L) than macroalgae (9.8 g/L). 
Previous  studies  have  shown  that  incorporating  a  catalyst 
can  considerably  enhance  the  gas  methane  content.  A  previous 
study conﬁrmed that a relatively pure form of methane could be 
produced at lower reaction conditions, noting that a 70.4% content 
of  methane  could  be  produced  upon  gasifying  acetone  (another 
model compound of HTL-AP) with a feedstock conversion of 99% 
at  a  temperature  of  350 °C,  a  retention  time  of  20  min,  and  the 
inclusion of a Ru/Al 
3  catalyst [294] . This study also concluded 
that  feedstock  concentration  and  methane  concentration  were 
positively correlated. One study demonstrated that catalysts have 
a  much  more  pronounced  impact  at  lower  temperatures  and

retention times. Interestingly, this study found that the selectivity 
of the Ru/Al 
3 catalyst to produce methane tended to exhibit an 
inverse parabolic correlation with retention time, ﬁrst increasing in 
methane content from 24.9% to 35.6% from 30 s to 90 s and then 
decreasing to 22.6% at 150 s [288] . It could be hypothesized that 
Ru  only  selectively  favors  methane  formation  at  lower  retention 
times and at higher retention times the oxidation of methane to 
carbon monoxide is favored. Another beneﬁt of Ru derivatives is 
that they have shown much promise as a promoter for methane 
gas  at  low  temperatures  for  the  gasiﬁcation  of  wastewater.  A 
previous  study  noted  that  both  Ru/AC  and  Ru/Al 
3  produced 
large  amounts  of  methane  (~32  vol.%)  at  low  reaction  severities 
(400 °C, 60 min) for the HTL-AP derived from human feces [26] . 
Catalysts  also  bolster  the  CCE  in  gasiﬁcation  processes.  Studies 
have  demonstrated  large  ranges  (8–98%)  in  the  CCE  values  of 
non-catalytic and catalytic gasiﬁcation ( Table 9 ) [253] . One theory 
has  been  proposed  regarding  CCE  values.  One  study  found  that 
the higher the content of nitrogen and oxygen-derivatives in the 
HTL-AP, the lower the CCE. Further, the greater the total acid num- 
ber and the amide contents were in the HTL-AP, the higher the 
CCE [77] .

In addition to producing valuable gaseous products, gasiﬁcation 
is also an effective means of cleaning HTL-AP and other wastew- 
aters,  which  leads  to  large  reduction  in  the  COD  (COD r )  and 
TOC (TOC r ) values. A previous study found that at a temperature 
of  450 °C  a  COD r  of  only  10–15%  was  observed  for  gasiﬁcation 
of  cutting  oil  and  vinasses,  two  types  of  organic  wastewaters 
generated from the alcohol production process by wine distillation 
[295] . However, the inclusion of oxygen and a 0.02% KOH catalyst 
was  able  to  substantially  increase  the  COD r  of  vinasses  by  over 
30% at 450 °C. Further, at an elevated temperature of 550 °C with a 
retention time of only 7.5s, a COD r of 87.2% was observed with the 
inclusion of oxygen and a KOH catalyst. Kipcak et al. also docu- 
mented that higher reaction severities (up to 600 °C and 150 s) led 
to the highest TOC r of more than 90% for the non-catalytic gasiﬁ- 
cation of olive mill wastewater [288] . However, this same research 
3  could 
group  demonstrated  that  the  incorporation  of  a  Ru/Al 
lead  to  a  modest  TOC r  value  of  79.3%  at  low  reaction  severities 
(400 °C,  30  s)  yet  a  substantial  TOC r  of  97.7%  at  a  high  reaction 
severity (600 °C, 150 s) for the catalytic gasiﬁcation of olive mill 
3 catalyst in 
wastewater [284] . It should be noted that the Ni/Al 
this study did not lead to a high TOC r  (9.34%) at a low reaction 
severity (400 °C, 30s). Thus, to maximize organic matter conversion 
while maintaining low reaction conditions, an appropriate catalyst 
must  be  selected  to  balance  eﬃciency  and  costs.  The  catalyst 
concentration has also been shown to increase TOC r , but only to 
a  limited  extent.  Gasiﬁcation  of  oily  wastewater  demonstrated 
that at 600 °C with a 200 s retention time, TOC r  increased from 
64% to 69% when the catalyst was increased from 0 mg/L KOH to 
100 mg/L, but the subsequent addition of 50 mg/L of catalyst only 
raised the TOC r by about 4%, indicating a trend of diminishing re- 
turns [253] . The initial concentration of the input wastewater also 
has a pronounced impact on the TOC r . Decreasing the organic load- 
ing of HTL–AP from 11,0 0 0 mg/L to 2,0 0 0 mg/L increased the TOC r 
from 60.1% to 99.2% at a constant temperature and retention time. 
Further, inclusion of a 1.5M NaOH catalyst also impacted the TOC r . 
As the organic loading for HTL-AP decreased from 11,0 0 0 mg/L to 
2,0 0 0 mg/L with the inclusion of NaOH, the TOC r increased from 
82.2% to 99.8% [25] . 

2 O 

Few studies have analyzed the incorporation of gasiﬁcation of 
HTL-AP into the HTL paradigm in order to increase the overall en- 
ergy recovery of the HTL process. Duan et al. demonstrated that 
14.3–25.6% of the algal biomass energy from microalgae was dis- 
tributed to the HTL-AP while that derived from macroalgae ranged 
from  6.0–41.1%.  This  study  demonstrated  that  54.8-75.1%  of  the 
energy  derived  from  the  microalgae  HTL-AP  and  18.3–49.3%  of 

the energy derived from macroalgae HTL-AP was transferred into 
the gaseous products after gasiﬁcation [77] . Thus, the integration 
of  HTL  and  gasiﬁcation  can  thereby  improve  the  energy  recov- 
ery of the HTL process compared to just HTL alone. Watson et al. 
also demonstrated that an energy recovery of up to 70% could be 
achieved for the gasiﬁcation of HTL-AP derived from human feces 
incorporating a Ni:Ru catalyst [26] . More studies need to be con- 
ducted which analyze the energy input needed in order to deter- 
mine the effective energy recovery not only of the feedstock versus 
the output gas but also to analyze the total output energy versus 
the input energy needed to heat the water, the energy associated 
with operating gasiﬁcation reactors, etc. 

5.2. Recycling of HTL-AP 

Although  most  studies  perceive  HTL-AP  as  an  environmen- 
tally hazardous by-product that requires additional treatment, oth- 
ers  studies  depict  HTL-AP  as  a  valuable  resource  for  enhancing 
thermochemical  conversion  outputs.  In  particular,  previous  stud- 
ies  have  shown  that  HTL-AP  can  be  recycled  back  into  the  HTL 
paradigm as a dilution agent which can inﬂuence the biocrude oil 
yield by altering the pH and introducing alkali salts to catalyze the 
formation of biocrude oil compounds. Furthermore, in comparison 
to other HTL-AP treatment methodologies, recycling holds promise 
because  it  is  simple  to  incorporate,  cost-effective,  and  relatively 
easy to scale-up. In addition, HTL requires the input of water, a 
commodity that may well see price hikes in the future; thus, re- 
cycling of the HTL-AP has signiﬁcant economic implications that 
could curtail the operating costs of the HTL process. 

Table 10 presents the recent studies recycling HTL-AP back into 
the HTL system. Multiple studies have reported that recycling HTL- 
AP has the potential to improve the biocrude oil yield. Biller et al. 
demonstrated that the biocrude oil yield increased by a maximum 
of 15.1% compared to utilizing fresh water after the HTL-AP was 
recycled six times. However, the biocrude oil yield showed no fur- 
ther increase after subsequent recycles [296] . Thus, recycling the 
HTL-AP phase continuously leads to diminished returns. In other 
words, recycling of HTL-AP initially causes sizeable increases in the 
biocrude yield and then this rate of increase diminishes with sub- 
sequent recycling cycles. Ramos-Tercero et al. also found a similar 
trend, noting that the biocrude oil yield increased from 14% to 42% 
after  the  HTL-AP  was  recycled  six  consecutive  times  [297] .  One 
theory is that the acetic acid and alkali salts present within HTL- 
AP cat alyzes the production of biocrude oil [298] . Zhu et al. also 
proposed this theory, noting that one explanation for the increase 
in biocrude oil yield through HTL-AP recycling could be explained 
by the HTL-AP accumulating short chain acids (acetic acid and lac- 
tic acid) which could enhance the decomposition of carbohydrates. 
This  was  also  conﬁrmed  by  a  previous  study  which  noted  that 
the  decomposition  rate  of  model  carbohydrate  compounds  was 
enhanced by the addition of organic acids during HTL experiments 
[75] . Furthermore, Chen et al. observed that HTL-AP recirculation 
reduced the content of organic acids in comparison to the original 
HTL-AP. This was attributed to the short chain acids reacting with 
intermediate HTL products [299] . 

2 CO 

Another theory is that the pH of the HTL-AP has a signiﬁcant 
impact on the biocrude oil productivity. Grigoras et al. noted that 
the presence of alkali constituents (NaOH, K 
3 , etc.) could retard 
the formation of char and augment the production of biocrude oil 
via retro-aldol reactions. Subsequent studies have conﬁrmed this 
point and noted that alkali components may also promote conden- 
sation reactions and inhibit re-polymerization reactions [300–302] . 
Jensen et al. conﬁrmed this result and added that the water-soluble 
organics  stabilized  intermediate  products  during  thermochemical 
treatment thereby impeding the formation of char [41] . In particu- 
lar, one study showed that at 400 °C and a retention time of 1 hour,

a mixture of phenol, water, and lignin could inhibit the formation 
of char [53] . This could be attributed to the presence of phenols 
in the recycled HTL-AP which could inhibit re-polymerization re- 
actions thereby reducing char accumulation [303] . 

In addition to impacting the biocrude oil productivity, HTL-AP 
recycling has been shown to inﬂuence the quality of the biocrude 
oil.  Hu  et  al.  discovered  that  recycling  HTL-AP  to  adjust  the 
feedstock  solid  content  led  to  a  higher C  content  (70.3%)  in  the 
biocrude  oil  compared  to  using  a  water  mixture  (64.2%)  and  a 
drastically lower O content (15.5%) compared to a water mixture 
(22.1%)  [304] .  Biller  et  al.  echoed  this  trend,  ﬁnding  that  the 
content of O in the biocrude oil decreased by 9.6% when recycling 
HTL-AP nine times compared to utilizing pure water as a dilution 
agent. However, the N content in the biocrude oil increased from 
5.0% to 8.3% as the HTL-AP was recycled up to nine times [296] . 
Previous studies have also noted that recycling the HTL-AP could 
result in the N content of the resulting biocrude oil increasing by 
a  range  of  0.1–3%  [ 296 , 297 , 304 , 305] .  Therefore,  recycling  of  the 
HTL-AP leads to a tradeoff in quality, as recycling tends to decrease 
the O content yet increase the N content of the biocrude oil. De- 
spite  the  tradeoffs  in  biocrude  oil  quality,  HTL-AP  recycling  has 
been shown to increase the energy recovery of the HTL process. 
Deniel et al. reported that recycling HTL-AP ﬁve times increased 
the energy recovery in the biocrude oil from 48% to 57% compared 
to  utilizing pure water  [305] . Previous  studies have also noticed 
energy recovery increases ranging from 13% to 28% when incorpo- 
rating HTL-AP recycling into the HTL process [ 296 , 297 , 304] . This 
is primarily explained by small increases in the HHV and biocrude 
oil yield accompanied with a high content of C present within the 
biocrude oil when the HTL-AP is recycled. 

Recycling also impacts the composition of HTL-AP. Deniel et al. 
found  that  recycling  of  the  HTL-AP  caused  the  TOC  to  increase 
from  12  g/L  to  a  maximum  of  35  g/L  [305] .  Biller  et  al.  also 
reported that the TOC in the HTL–AP increased signiﬁcantly from 
25 g/L to 92 g/L after recycling the HTL-AP derived from the HTL 
of distillers dried grains a total of eight times [296] . Further, Biller 
et al. noted that the TN content also increased from 6 g/L to 25 g/L 
after the recycling of HTL-AP was conducted nine times [296] . A 
previous study stated this trend could be attributed to the accumu- 
lation of acidic compounds derived from carbohydrate derivatives 
(acetic  acid)  and  ammonia  which  is  commonly  produced  during 

the  breakdown  of  proteins  [298] .  The  large  concentration  of 
acetic  acid  and  ammonia  in  the  recycled  HTL-AP  could  lead  to 
another avenue of revenue in the HTL process, since these concen- 
trated  compounds  could  be  separated  and  subsequently  sold  on 
the market. 

Recirculation  of  HTL-AP  has  the  potential  to  signiﬁcantly  im- 
prove  the  economics  and  footprint  of  continuous  biocrude  oil 
production  processes.  Previous  studies  involving  a  proprietary 
Hydrofaction TM technology, a combination of supercritical HTL and 
subsequent  hydrotreating  for  the  production  of  drop-in  biofuel, 
discovered that recirculation of the HTL-AP and biocrude oil could 
improve  the  feed  characteristics,  energy  balance,  oil  quality,  and 
the oil yield [42] . Speciﬁcally, LCA of Hydrofaction TM  technology 
demonstrated that this technology could reduce GHG emissions by 
between 77–108% (based on different LCA scenarios) in comparison 
to  petroleum-derived  products  [42] .  Fig.  20  provides  an  illustra- 
tive  depiction  of  the  Hydrofaction TM  technology  process  ﬂow 
diagram. 

In  addition  to  a  reduced  carbon  footprint,  recycling  HTL-AP 
led  to  more  a  pumpable  feedstock  slurry  during  continuous 
processing.  Moreover,  recirculation  of  HTL-AP  could  mitigate  or 
eliminate  operating  costs  associated  with  water  treatment  tech- 
nology frequently plaguing biocrude oil production processes [41] . 
However, one contingency to being able to recirculate HTL-AP is 
that recalcitrant compounds need to be isolated and removed to 
avoid excessive buildup. For example, Jensen et al. demonstrated 
that 5–15% of the HTL-AP needs to be ﬁrst extracted before recir- 
culation in order to prevent the accumulation of chloride, which 
increased by over 100% after six recirculation cycles when woody 
biomass  was  utilized  as  the  feedstock  [41] .  Thus,  recirculation 
of  HTL-AP  cannot  completely  eliminate  the  need  for  wastewater 
treatment technology (anaerobic digestion, gasiﬁcation, etc.), but it 
can drastically reduce the volume of wastewater that needs to be 
treated. 

In conclusion, recycling of HTL-AP demonstrates great promise 
as a means of enhancing biocrude oil properties, reducing the car- 
bon footprint of biocrude oil production processes, and enhancing 
energy eﬃciency. Recirculation of HTL-AP has been demonstrated 
to be an effective technique at a large scale, and it is currently one 
of the closest methods to reaching full-scale commercialization of 
all other HTL-AP treatment methodologies.

6. Integrated pathways of energy and nutrients recovery for 
the valorization of HTL-AP 

Simultaneously  meeting  the  objectives  of  organics  removal, 
nutrients recycling, value-added chemicals separation, and biofuel 
production can be achieved by combining multiple valorization ap- 
proaches. Although each individual technique suffers from distinct 
drawbacks,  the  pitfalls  of  each  method  can  be  mitigated  when 
combined into one interconnected approach, thereby limiting the 
individual shortcomings when only one approach is incorporated. 
For example, HTL-AP recycling and chemical separation valoriza- 
tion  approaches  show  promise,  but  each  needs  to  be  further 
evaluated  because  information  regarding  upscale  feasibility  and 
process economics is scarce. In comparison, gasiﬁcation and anaer- 
obic digestion have demonstrated promising commercial potential 
towards converting HTL-AP. Speciﬁcally, commercial infrastructure 
of  gasiﬁcation  technology  has  already  been  reported  [273] ,  and 
anaerobic  digestion  is  a  robust  and  eﬃcient  technology  for  the 
production of energy that has been optimized for many decades 
[309] .  Both  anaerobic  fermentation  and  gasiﬁcation  can  convert 
the organics within HTL-AP; however, subsequent nutrient recov- 
ery of the residue has not yet been achieved. Hence, an integrated 
system should be built up, which interlaces anaerobic fermenta- 
tion/hydrothermal gasiﬁcation with algae cultivation. In this man- 
ner, the inorganic nitrogen and phosphorous left over by these bi- 
ological and thermochemical processes can be used as a substrate 
of  for  algae  cultivation,  and  the  produced  biomass  could  subse- 
quently be fed back into the HTL paradigm for continued biofuels 
production. 

6.1. Integration of anaerobic digestion and algae cultivation 

Algae cultivation using the eﬄuent from anaerobic digestion of 
different f eedstock has been extensively studied [310–312] . These 

previous studies indicated the feasibility of successfully integrating 
anaerobic  fermentation  and  algae  cultivation.  Chen  et  al.  con- 
ﬁrmed that the integration of anaerobic fermentation with algae 
cultivation leads to beneﬁts including reducing the process carbon 
footprint and managing the production cost for conventional algae 
cultivation  [313] .  In  addition,  toxic  compounds  such  as  phenols, 
furanic compounds, and N-heterocycles in HTL-AP could be partly 
or  completely  degraded  during  anaerobic  fermentation,  and  this 
detoxiﬁcation  process  could  beneﬁt  the  eﬃcacy  of  algae  cultiva- 
tion. Yang et al. veriﬁed this hypothesis, noting that the biomass 
accumulation,  biomass  production  rate,  and  the  tolerance  of 
HTL-AP were signiﬁcantly improved after anaerobic fermentation 
[204] . 

A Sankey diagram is presented to evaluate the performance of 
mass, C, N and energy ﬂows during the integration of HTL, inten- 
siﬁed anaerobic fermentation, and algae cultivation ( Fig. 21 ). First, 
the feedstock was converted to biocrude oil, solid phase, HTL-AP, 
and gaseous product via HTL (data based on chapter 2). The pro- 
duced biocrude oil would then be further upgraded to transporta- 
tion fuel through distillation combined with esteriﬁcation accord- 
ing to a previous study [11] . The solid residue produced via up- 
grading could be applied as bitumen during subsequent processing 
[314] . HTL-AP was then converted to biogas via intensiﬁed anaer- 
obic digestion with GAC addition according to Si et al. [21] . The 
polished liquid after anaerobic digestion of HTL-AP could then be 
further used as the medium for algae cultivation [204] . The solid 
product produced after HTL could be used as biochar for further 
application in other industries. Finally, the carbon dioxide in the 
HTL gaseous products and biogas could be used as a C source for 
algae cultivation [313] . 

The  mass  distribution  showed  that  30.5%  of  mass  was  trans- 
ferred to algae biomass. This is because the carbon dioxide in both 
the gaseous product and biogas was used by algae as a C source, 
and most of the inorganic salts (N, P, K, etc.) were used as nutri- 
ents during algae growth. In comparison, only a limited amount of

convert  the  compounds  that  were  not  eﬃciently  treated,  such 
as  N-heterocyclic  compounds.  A  similar  integrated  process  has 
been  applied  to  a  process  involving  hydrogen  gas  production 
from  cellulose  by  combining  an  anaerobic  fermentation  reac- 
tor  and  a  MFC  to  produce  power  for  MEC  [316] .  However,  this 
integration  has  not  been  reported  as  a  means  to  treat  HTL-AP, 
so  the  feasibility  of  this  methodology  still  needs  to  be  further 
evaluated. 

6.2. Integration of hydrothermal gasiﬁcation and algae cultivation 

The  combination  of  HTL,  hydrothermal  gasiﬁcation  and  algae 
cultivation  was  also  proposed  [222] .  The  water  produced  from 
gasiﬁcation contains speciﬁc nutrients that are beneﬁcial for algae 
cultivation  [317–320] .  Previous  studies  veriﬁed  that  almost  all 
organics in HTL-AP were removed (57.1–98.2%) via hydrothermal 
gasiﬁcation [ 77 , 134 , 317] . Li et al. found that 98.3% of N after gasiﬁ- 
cation was in the form of inorganic nitrogen [134] . This suggested 
that  a  vast  majority  of  organics  in  HTL-AP,  including  the  in- 
hibitors and nitrogen-containing organics, were converted through 
hydrothermal gasiﬁcation. Hence, an improvement of algae cultiva- 
tion using the liquid product from hydrothermal gasiﬁcation could 
be expected. 

The  ﬂows  of  mass,  C,  N,  and  energy  by  integrating  HTL,  hy- 
drothermal  gasiﬁcation,  and  algae  cultivation  are  shown  in  a 
Sankey  diagram  ( Fig.  22 ).  The  feedstock  was  ﬁrst  converted  to 
biocrude  oil,  solid  phase,  HTL-AP,  and  gaseous  products  via  HTL 
(data  based  on  chapter  2).  The  produced  biocrude  oil  would  be 
further  upgraded  to  fuel  [11] ,  and  the  residue  after  upgrading 
could  applied  as  bitumen  [314] .  The  HTL-AP  was  converted  to 
syngas (hydrogen, methane, and carbon dioxide) via hydrothermal 
gasiﬁcation as described based on preceding studies [ 77 , 134] . The 
liquid product after hydrothermal gasiﬁcation could then be fur- 
ther used as the medium for algae cultivation. The gaseous product 
(mainly carbon dioxide) was used as a C source for algae cultiva- 
tion, and the produced syngas from hydrothermal gasiﬁcation was 
puriﬁed  using  algae  in  which  carbon  dioxide  could  be  removed 
[313] . 

The results suggested that 39.8% of mass was transferred to the 
algae biomass. It should be clariﬁed that 23.7% of C in the feed- 
stock was transferred to algae which mainly served as the C source 
for photosynthesis. In addition, 43.8% of energy was converted to 
transportation  fuels  which  consisted  of  liquid  fuel  and  hythane. 
This value was slightly higher than that in the integration of anaer- 
obic fermentation (40.8%). This could be attributed to the enhanced 
energy  recovery  from  the  feedstock  in  hydrothermal  gasiﬁcation 
compared  with  anaerobic  fermentation.  However,  the  extensive 
energy required for thermochemical conversion is not considered 
in  this  ﬂow,  so  evaluation  involving  the  energy  required  for 
heating, cooling, and reactor operation should also be considered 
in future studies. Of note, integration with gasiﬁcation showed a 
different N ﬂow pattern than that resulting from the integration 
with anaerobic digestion. Integration with hydrothermal gasiﬁca- 
tion resulted in 62.9% of the N being ﬁxed by algae and only 12.5% 
being discharged into the environment. This is due to the fact that 
nitrogen-containing organics were more effectively converted via 
hydrothermal gasiﬁcation compared with anaerobic fermentation. 
The  N  in  the  liquid  products  produced  after  gasiﬁcation  existed 
in  the  form  of  ammonia,  which  is  easier  be  utilized  by  algae 
than  the  nitrogen-containing  compounds  in  the  liquid  produced 
from anaerobic digestion. Thus, based on the above environmental 
implications  and  N  recovery  trends,  the  integration  of  HTL  with 
hydrothermal  gasiﬁcation  and  algae  cultivation  demonstrated  a 
greater prospect for process integration compared with anaerobic 
fermentation.

HTL, intensiﬁed anaerobic digestion, and algae cultivation for HTL-AP valorization. 

energy was transformed in the algae (0.6%), which predominantly 
came  from  the  residue  of  organic  acids  in  the  liquid  product  of 
anaerobic  digestion.  Most  of  the  energy  (40.8%)  was  converted 
to transportation fuels which consisted of upgraded biocrude oil 
and methane which could be used as diesel blendstocks [11] and 
gas fuels in internal-combustion engines [315] , respectively. It can 
be  seen  that  the  HTL-AP  contributed  a  higher  energy  recovery 
through anaerobic fermentation than biocrude oil after upgrading. 
This  is  because  only  about  30%  of  the  initial  biocrude  oil  was 
upgraded  to  transportation  fuels  [11] ,  and  43.8%  of  the  energy 
was  transferred  to  the  biocrude  oil  during  HTL.  This  trend  also 
corresponded to the C distribution in the produced fuels, which 
was primarily derived from the anaerobic fermentation of HTL-AP. 
The N ﬂow suggested that most of the N (40.7%) was transferred 
into biomass via algae cultivation. However, 34.7% of the N was 
lost  from  the  liquid  products  after  anaerobic  fermentation.  The 
lost  N  mainly  consisted  of  nitrogen-containing  polymers  which 
cannot be effectively converted by anaerobic microbes, and this N 
loss may lead to increased environmental safety hazards. However, 
these  recalcitrant  nitrogen-containing  organics  can  be  adsorbed 
by  activated  carbon.  Considering  the  potential  commercial  ap- 
plications, activated carbon can be packed in a high rate reactor 
to  act  as  a  bioﬁlm  carrier  and  adsorbent.  Post-treatment  of  the 
liquid products may also be an applicable pathway. For example, 
MEC  could  treat  the  eﬄuents  from  anaerobic  fermentation  and

7. Life cycle assessment (LCA) and techno-economic assessment 
(TEA) 

In  recent  years,  a  myriad  of  analytical  techniques  have  been 
incorporated to assess the commercial and industrial feasibility of 
selling biofuels produced via HTL of biomass. To analyze both the 
environmental and economic implications of this thermochemical 
process, LCA and TEA have been generally employed by researchers 
as tools to judge the potential of upscaling the HTL process to bet- 
ter meet the world’s fuel needs. Few LCA studies have assessed the 
production of biocrude oil derived from feedstock other than algae, 
since algae-derived biocrude oil is a well-researched, mature, and 
holistic method to produce biocrude oil. Calculations and quantiﬁ- 
cations of the energy consumption and emissions present within 
HTL  LCA  studies  can  be  separated  into  two  distinct  categories: 
feedstock  production  (algae  growth,  cultivation,  and  harvesting) 
and biocrude oil production (HTL processing, production of HTL-AP, 

etc.)  [321–323] .  However,  due  to  the  fact  that  LCA  involves  the 
establishment  of  myriad  assumptions  regarding  the  process  and 
due to the lack of standardization of these assumptions amongst 
researchers  in  this  ﬁeld,  the  results  presented  by  LCA  studies 
involve  a  high  degree  of  uncertainty  and  the  assessment  of  the 
net  energy  production  and  GHG  emissions  amongst  different 
studies are diﬃcult to compare [324] . 

Table  11  presents  a  comparison  of  HTL  and  other  biomass- 
to-energy conversion technologies from an emissions and energy 
vantage  point.  It  should  be  noted  that  HTL  technology  can  aug- 
ment its energy and LCA favorability by employing mild upgrading 
techniques, including distillation/esteriﬁcation as opposed to tra- 
ditional  hydrotreating/hydrocracking  [11] .  Despite  the  reduced 
energy input associated with mild upgrading techniques, the cur- 
rent state of HTL technology still necessitates a 28% greater energy 
input than diesel production technology and a signiﬁcantly larger 
input compared to traditional landﬁlling and incineration methods.

However,  HTL  shows  promise  from  an  energy  recovery  and 
emissions perspective. 

Speciﬁcally, HTL is optimistically able to lead to improved en- 
ergy recovery ratio values compared with conventional diesel and 
anaerobic digestion technology depending on the type of upgrad- 
ing technology utilized in the HTL process. HTL also offers distinct 
environmental advantages. Although HTL combined with mild up- 
grading was found to have similar emissions to conventional diesel 
and anaerobic digestion technology, HTL leads to signiﬁcantly less 
emissions  than  landﬁlling  (4.5-9x),  incineration  (10x),  and  lipid 
extraction  (5.5-37x).  Despite  the  promising  LCA  results  of  HTL 
and upgrading technology, further enhancements can be made by 
valorizing HTL-AP. 

Juneja et al. investigated the environmental impact of upgrading 
biocrude oil derived from the HTL of wastewater algae and discov- 
2 -eq MJ −1 , which 
ered that the total GHG emissions were 110 g CO 
was less than that produced by conventional diesel when both cat- 
alytic gasiﬁcation of HTL-AP and biocrude oil hydrotreating were 
involved  [325] .  Meanwhile,  Ponnusamy  et  al.  reported  that  1  kg 
algae biodiesel produced from subcritical water ﬁxed 0.6 kg of car- 
bon dioxide with an energy demand of 28.23 MJ when anaerobic 
digestion of HTL-AP and a trans-esteriﬁcation process were used in 
the system [326] . However, Karne et al. compared the hydrother- 
mal  conversion  pathway  for  microalgae  to  biodiesel  with  other 
pathways and did not include the scenario involving the cultivation 
of algae, HTL-AP valorization, etc. Thus, LCA performance reports 
concerned with biocrude oil production are signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced 
by the process settings and assumed performance parameters of 
HTL, making the comparison between different studies tedious and 
unreasonable. Further, since the upstream and downstream factors 
of HTL processing are critical for the LCA output parameters, stan- 
dardization is needed to avoid large discrepancies in data outputs 
among different research groups [ 46 , 327] . 

In  recent  years,  researchers  have  tried  to  shift  their  focus  to 
utilizing other feedstock besides algae for LCA studies. Of partic- 
ular interest, researchers have started to investigate utilizing wet 
biowaste as a HTL feedstock, mainly emphasizing sludge, manure, 
etc.  However,  the  process  parameters  can  become  more  compli- 
cated compared to algae when this type of feedstock is considered. 
Regarding  the  valorization  of  HTL-AP,  previous  LCA  studies  have 
focused on a couple of different approaches and valorization meth- 
ods, including catalytic gasiﬁcation, anaerobic digestion, recycling 
of HTL-AP back into the HTL paradigm, and recovery of nutrients 
in  HTL-AP  via  algae  cultivation  [ 242 , 328] .  Previous  studies  have 
indicated that the recovery, recycling, or valorization of the HTL-AP 
has  a  critical  impact  on  the  overall  LCA  analysis  results.  Fig.  23 
illustrates that the GHG emissions for biowaste to biofuel studies 
incorporating different HTL-AP valorization pathways reported by 
previous LCA studies. 

Techno-economic assessment (TEA) modeling has also emerged 
as  an  important  tool  to  understand  the  commercial  viability  of 
biowaste-to-biofuel  thermochemical  techniques.  Engineering  re- 
lated  processing  models  with  simulation  software  packages  are 
generally used to estimate the investment and ﬁnal selling prices 

Fig. 23.  GHG emissions for biowaste-to-biofuel technologies using HTL integrated 
with different HTL-AP valorization pathways. Results are based on previous studies 
involving different HTL-AP valorization methods: anaerobic digestion, algae cultiva- 
tion, catalytic hydrothermal gasiﬁcation, and others [ 322 , 325 , 328–336] . 

of the ﬁnal product [ 324 , 337] . Previous studies have determined 
that not only is the biocrude oil yield an instrumental factor inﬂu- 
encing the optimism or pessimism of TEA studies, but the capacity 
for sustainable production also plays a critical role in this analysis 
[325] .  Another  two  inﬂuential  parameters  include  reducing  the 
burden  of  the  HTL  process  on  the  environment  and  maximizing 
long-term proﬁtability. 

For biocrude oil derived from the HTL of algae, TEA studies have 
successfully  analyzed the economic outputs as a function of the 
operating costs, energy eﬃciency, taxes, etc. Jiang et al. estimated 
the techno-economic uncertainty of algal-derived biocrude oil by 
HTL,  and  the  results  demonstrated  that  the  minimum  biocrude 
selling price was nearly 5–16 USD/GGE with an uncertainty level 
of about 12%. The large uncertainty in the overall cost was associ- 
ated with the feedstock cost. In Jiang et al.’s study, it was assumed 
that  the  price  of  acquiring  algae  for  HTL  reactions  could  range 
from 400 USD/daf ton to 1800 USD/daf ton. This study came to the 
conclusion that large uncertainties are incurred in TEA analysis by 
both feedstock costs and biocrude oil selectivity [338] . Katherine 
et al. evaluated the metrics of economic viability of microalgae HTL 
using TEA, and a minimum selling price of 10.4 USD/GGE was re- 
ported. Katherine et al. also determined that the ash content of the 
algae, biomass costs, and reaction yields were regarded as the most 
important factors inﬂuencing the proﬁtability of biocrude oil pro- 
duction according to the sensitivity analysis [333] . When a fermen- 
tation step was used to pretreat the feedstock for HTL for the frac- 
tionation of fusel alcohols, the minimum selling price of biocrude 
oil increased to 12.8 USD/GGE due to the high operational costs 
and additional taxes. Panneerselvam et al. evaluated the TEA analy- 
sis of biofuels from HTL of algae from wastewater with a hydropro- 
cessing process, and the minimum selling price of the hydrocarbon

fuels was estimated to be 4.3 USD/GGE, while the algae cultivation 
and utility cost accounted for the majority of the capital cost and 
operating cost, respectively [339] . 

However, in Nie et al.’s study, the minimum selling price based 
on the production of biocrude oil derived from forest residues was 
reported to be 63–80% higher than that of conventional petroleum 
fuels. The yield of biocrude oil was the most inﬂuential parameter 
in determining the selling price. However, another inﬂuential factor 
was the transportation cost of the biocrude oil. This study deter- 
mined  that  minimizing  the  transportation  distance  between  the 
location of biocrude oil production and the post-production facility 
(bioreﬁnery,  oil  pre-processing  reﬁnery,  etc.)  was  able  to  reduce 
the operating costs; however, costs associated with transportation 
did not have a large impact on the overall capital investment of 
this  expenditure  [340] .  Thus,  maximizing  the  biocrude  oil  yield 
is  essential  to  enhancing  the  economic  performance  of  the  HTL 
process. In summary, the properties of the feedstock, the employed 
pretreatment processes, the transportation of the biocrude oil, the 
capital  investment,  and  the  potential  for  technological  advance- 
ment  all  have  the  potential  to  inﬂuence  the  TEA  outputs  and 
thereby result in large price ﬂuctuations amongst different studies. 
Therefore, controlling the critical contributors to these economic 
uncertainties  needs  to  be  made  a  point  of  emphasis  in  future 
studies to ensure the comparability of different studies. 

Fig. 24 depicts the current cost contributions calculated by the 
U.S. DOE for the 2015 state of HTL technology (SOT) and projected 
cost  breakdown  for  the  projected  2022  case  of  HTL  technology 
[20] . In order to meet the projected fuel selling price of $4.5/GGE 
and  eventually  meet  the  DOE’s  $3.0/GGE  performance  goal,  sig- 
niﬁcant  reductions  in  costs  need  to  be  achieved.  The  feedstock 
and  processing  of  the  HTL-AP  currently  account  for  the  largest 
fractions of the selling price, accounting for 67–81% and 10–12% 
of  the  selling  price,  respectively.  However,  the  feedstock  contri- 
bution could be reduced by utilizing waste feedstock (food waste, 
animal  excreta,  etc.)  as  opposed  to  cultivated  algae.  Distillation 

combined with esteriﬁcation has also recently been proposed as 
an alternative biocrude oil upgrading approach which has shown 
promise as an inexpensive method which could further reduce the 
overall selling price by reducing costs associated with biocrude oil 
upgrading [11] . However, the DOE proposes that the fundamental 
issue that needs to be addressed is ensuring that the highest value 
is obtained from the HTL-AP in order to meet the current projected 
goals [20] . 

The selection of a HTL-AP pretreatment process has been shown 
to incur sizeable pecuniary costs which inﬂuence the outlook of 
TEA studies. Juneja et al. previously analyzed the techno-economic 
variables  associated  with  the  production  of  renewable  diesel 
produced from algae cultivated in wastewater while concomitantly 
employing catalytic hydrothermal gasiﬁcation as a treatment step 
for  HTL-AP.  The  results  demonstrated  that  the  valorization  of 
HTL-AP  had a  signiﬁcant impact on  the  renewable diesel selling 
price.  Sensitivity  analysis  from  this  study  demonstrated  that  the 
total  volume  of  HTL-AP  produced  had  a  signiﬁcant  inﬂuence  on 
the selling price of renewable diesel [325] . Moreover, the price of 
renewable diesel was calculated to be 6.62 USD/GGE, and the cul- 
tivation of algae and harvesting accounted for the largest fraction 
of the total cost (~56%) [325] . Zhu et al. compared the economic 
analysis  of  HTL  of  algae  coupled  with  three  different  HTL-AP 
valorization methods: direct recycling to the algae farm, catalytic 
hydrothermal  gasiﬁcation,  and  anaerobic  digestion.  The  results 
suggested  that  anaerobic  digestion  and  catalytic  hydrothermal 
gasiﬁcation increased the minimum fuel selling price by about 11% 
and  2.9%  over  direct  recycling  of  HTL-AP.  The  main  contributing 
factor was the high capital and operating costs. Meanwhile, anaer- 
obic  digestion  for  HTL-AP  showed  advantages  over  catalytic  hy- 
drothermal gasiﬁcation due to the lower energy requirements and 
costs [341] . Si et al. previously compared benchmark commercial 
applications  of  two  different  HTL-AP  valorization  methodologies, 
two-stage fermentation and catalytic hydrothermal gasiﬁcation, to 
produce  biohythane  [242] .  The  results  suggested  that  two-stage

37 

fermentation with conventional reactors resulted in a higher net 
energy  return  than  that  of  catalytic  hydrothermal  gasiﬁcation. 
Additionally, two-stage fermentation coupled with high-rate reac- 
tors  with  a  high  density  of  robust  microbes  resulted  in  a  lower 
minimum selling price ( −0.71 to 2.59 USD/GGE) than conventional 
fossil fuels, which demonstrates the necessity of employing HTL- 
AP valorization methods into the HTL paradigm to ensure ﬁnancial 
feasibility. 

Currently, research focusing on the different valorization tech- 
niques  of  HTL-AP  in  order  to  enhance  TEA  outlooks  is  sparse. 
Since the production of HTL-AP in HTL processes has been shown 
to negatively impact the economic prospects of HTL, future studies 
need  to  place  an  emphasis  on  HTL-AP  valorization  in  order  to 
assure  commercial  success  of  this  thermochemical  technology. 
However,  HTL-AP  also  needs  to  be  further  investigated  due  to 
its  environmental  implications.  With  the  increasing  stringency 
of  environmental  standards,  it  is  very  important  to  incorporate 
HTL-AP  into  economic  analysis  in  order  to  assure  that  the  HTL 
process meets environmental regulations for subsequent discharge 
and/or  reuse.  In  addition,  the  scale  and  industrialization  poten- 
tial  of  HTL  has  still  yet  to  be  elucidated.  There  is  currently  a 
dearth of pilot scale studies focusing on the challenges involving 
large-scale  production  of  biocrude  oil,  and  the  sustainable  ways 
of  converting  waste  to  energy  and  dealing  with  the  HTL-AP  is 
still  not  well  understood.  In  conclusion,  taking  consideration  of 
the  way  in  which  HTL-AP  is  handled,  treated,  and  recovered 

would  greatly  beneﬁt  the  economic  prospects  of  HTL,  and  more 
research  is  needed  to  better  understand  the  speciﬁc  avenues  of 
HTL-AP valorization which offer the most optimistic TEA and LCA 
outlooks. 

8. Challenges and prospects 

8.1. Technologies for valorizing HTL-AP 

The conversion approaches for HTL-AP detailed in this review 
are  compared  and  contrasted  in  Fig.  25 .  Further,  a  summary 
regarding the  technical prospects of  these techniques  is detailed 
below: 

• Separation  and  concentration  of  value-added  chemicals  from 
HTL-AP  remains  a  promising  direction  to  improve  the  com- 
mercial potential of HTL. Further optimization of this pathway 
shows potential as a way to develop mass market sales chan- 
nels  for  solvents,  acids,  and  other  chemical  precursors.  How- 
ever, current research only focuses on HTL-AP with a simplistic 
chemical composition (e.g. extracting the phenols and organic 
acids from HTL-AP derived from lignocellulose). HTL-AP with a 
complex composition has not yet been investigated. In addition, 
separation and concentration also faces economic and sustain- 
ability  barriers.  The  combination  of  separation  and  biological 
conversion  techniques  may  be  a  promising  future  direction, 

Fig. 25.  Comparison of the state of technology of different HTL-AP valorization approaches. The advantages and limitation are evaluated based on the ﬁndings of previous 
studies. 

38

since  some  value-added  chemicals  (phenols  and  nitrogen- 
containing organics) are regarded as inhibitors, and the resid- 
ual organics after separation could serve as the feedstock for 
subsequent biological processing. 

• Biomass cultivation using HTL-AP as a culture medium leads to 
a high nutrients recovery and is an economically cost-effective 
technique for the production of fertilizer. However, inhibition 
and low eﬃciency of organics utilization limits the application 
of HTL-AP with a high concentration of organics as a culture 
medium.  In  addition,  the  commercial  application  of  the  pro- 
duced  biomass  also  faces  challenges  because  of  the  environ- 
mental risk of heavy metals accumulation and the large land 
area requirement. 

• Bioelectrochemical systems advantageously resulted in the con- 
version of recalcitrant compounds (phenols, furan derivatives, 
and N-heterocycles). Further, energy, gas, and electricity could 
all be achieved. However, future studies need to focus on the 
full-scale commercial application of this technology in terms of 
eﬃciency and cost-effectiveness. 

• Anaerobic fermentation of HTL-AP shows potential for commer- 
cial application, since it is already considered a mature tech- 
nology. However, the limited conversion of nitrogen-containing 
organics suggested that the residual eﬄuent needs subsequent 
post-treatment using other valorization approaches. In addition, 
pre-treatment  of  HTL-AP,  enrichment  of  functional  microbes, 
and bio-augmentation need to be emphasized to enhance the 
anaerobic fermentation of HTL-AP. 

• The recycling of HTL-AP has demonstrated positive correlations 
with the biocrude oil yield and energy recovery. However, recy- 
cling results in an apparent increase in the COD and TN of the 
HTL-AP, which could pose grave issues for subsequent dispos- 
ability, reduce the eﬃcacy of utilizing HTL-AP for algae growth, 
contribute to environmental contamination if released into the 
environment, and reduce the long-term storability potential of 
this wastewater. Thus, although recycling of HTL-AP is simple 
to  employ,  cost-effective,  and  doesn’t  require  much  effort  to 
scale-up, recycling exacerbates the problem associated with the 
toxicity of HTL-AP. Since recycling increases the concentration 
of organic matter in the HTL-AP, future studies should empha- 
size the combination of this technique with other valorization 
methods, such as value-added chemical separation or gasiﬁca- 
tion (production of syngas/hythane). 

• Gasiﬁcation  suffers  from  a  high  energy  demand  and  incurs 
high  capital  and  operating  costs  associated  with  catalyst  in- 
corporation  and  stringent  reactor  speciﬁcations.  Gasiﬁcation 
still needs to  overcome issues associated with low eﬃciency, 
low yields, catalyst deactivation, and gas separation/puriﬁcation 
before  it  can  be  viewed  as  a  mainstream  treatment  tech- 
nique  for  HTL-AP.  Gasiﬁcation  can  be  easily  integrated  into 
a  HTL  bioreﬁnery  to  enhance  commercialization  potential  of 
biocrude  oil  production  technology;  however,  there  are  still 
quandaries surrounding the understanding of gasiﬁcation reac- 
tions,  ideal  reaction  design,  gas  cleanup,  and  HTL-AP  feeding 
techniques. 

8.2. Constructing an interconnected energy production and waste 
valorization paradigm 

To enhance the prospects of large-scale HTL entering the main- 
stream  biocrude  oil  market,  valorization  of  HTL-AP  is  a  critical 
and necessary ﬁrst step. Further research should be conducted to 
co-optimize  the  energy  recovery  (or  ECR),  the  economic  poten- 
tial, and GHG emissions of the different paradigms associated with 
HTL into one, complete entity, including HTL biocrude oil produc- 
tion, HTL-AP valorization, biocrude oil upgrading, etc. Based on this 

perspective, attractive avenues of future work concerning the inter- 
connection of these paradigms are presented below: 

From the perspective of the HTL process, future studies should 
focus on optimizing the energy and elemental distribution through 
interconnection  of  HTL  and  HTL-AP  valorization.  For  example, 
recovering  more  C  in  the  biocrude  oil  would  enhance  the  en- 
ergy  recovery  of  the  HTL  process  and  concurrently  improve  the 
prospects  of  valorizing  HTL-AP.  In  particular,  lowering  the  con- 
centration of organic material in HTL-AP would be beneﬁcial for 
subsequent biological conversion, since this would avoid problems 
associated with microbial organic shock. Moreover, this would also 
reduce the need for serial dilution of HTL-AP, leading to economic 
incentives stemming from reductions in reactor volumes. The gas 
produced from biological conversion of HTL-AP could also be recy- 
cled back into the HTL process as a headspace gas, thereby leading 
to an increased energy recovery, enhanced C/H content in the oil, 
and elevated biocrude oil yield. In contrast, N, P, K, and S should 
be selectively transferred into the HTL-AP through optimization of 
the HTL process and reaction conditions. N and S in the biocrude 
oil are diﬃcult to remove via upgrading, and current regulations 
restrict the allowable concentration of these heteroatoms in trans- 
portation fuels in order to circumvent the production of harmful 
emissions.  Selectively  isolating  N,  P,  and  K  in  HTL-AP  would 
enhance the feasibility of utilizing this wastewater as a means to 
produce fertilizer or cultivate biomass. In addition, heavy metals 
migration should be optimized to ensure accumulation in the solid 
residue for safe disposal and treatment, since accumulation in HTL- 
AP would curt ail the potential of this product to be used as a fertil- 
izer and for biomass cultivation. The exploration of membranes as 
physical adsorbents of metal ions in HTL-AP should also be consid- 
ered as a way to diminish the toxicity associated with this aqueous 
stream 

Synergy  also  exists  for  the  interconnection  of  HTL-AP  val- 
orization  techniques  and  biocrude  oil  upgrading.  For  example, 
hydrogen  production  from  gasiﬁcation  and  anaerobic  digestion 
of  HTL-AP  can  be  used  as  a  headspace  gas  for  biocrude  oil 
hydrotreating  and  hydrocracking.  The  methane  produced  via 
anaerobic fermentation can serve as a heating source for both HTL 
and  gasiﬁcation  reactors,  thereby  augmenting  the  potential  for 
constructing  a  combined  biocrude  oil  production  and  processing 
bioreﬁnery  and  reducing  costs  associated  with  electricity.  Addi- 
tionally, value-added chemicals extracted from HTL-AP could serve 
as fuel additives (acetic acid, butanol, etc.), which would improve 
the  characteristics  of  biocrude  oil  (viscosity,  total  acid  number, 
pour  point,  etc.)  and  serve  as  a  mild  means  of  biocrude  oil 
upgrading. 

Based  on  the  characteristics  of  different  HTL-AP  processing 
techniques, a process-intensiﬁcation strategy could be helpful for 
upscaling and commercializing HTL technology. Realizing a multi- 
scenario optimization strategy involving the combination of mul- 
tiple  HTL-AP  valorization  techniques  with  traditional  HTL  and 
biocrude  upgrading  paradigms  is  needed  to  properly  assess  the 
synergistic  and  antagonistic  relationships  between  the  different 
scenarios. The environmental sustainability and economics of the 
integration  process  also  needs  further  evaluation  in  order  to 
achieve  reductions  in  GHG  emissions  and  costs.  The  continued 
analysis of these interconnected paradigms would create a driving 
force for more R&D focusing on co-optimizing biocrude oil produc- 
tion and wastewater valorization. 

In order to achieve an interwoven paradigm of HTL-AP valoriza- 
tion pathways with HTL and bioreﬁning, collaboration is needed 
among researchers in a myriad of different ﬁelds, including scien- 
tists to better control the energy recovery of the oil phase, micro- 
biologists to investigate and manipulate the microbial community 
for effective anaerobic fermentation, engineers to conduct process- 
intensiﬁcation  analysis,  economists  to  achieve  multi-objective 

J. Watson, T. Wang and B. Si et al. / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 77 (2020) 100819

optimization, statisticians/computational scientists to conceptualize 
a harmonized LCA model, and mathematicians to apply the inter- 
connection of these paradigms to game theory.
