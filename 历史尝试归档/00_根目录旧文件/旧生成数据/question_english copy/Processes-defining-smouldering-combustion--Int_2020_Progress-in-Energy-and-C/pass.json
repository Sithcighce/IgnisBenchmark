    "question_text": "What distinguishes self-sustained smouldering from smouldering propagation, and how do heat and mass transfer inefficiencies affect the transition between these states?",
    "standard_answer": "Self-sustained smouldering is a local chemical process where net exothermic reactions (e.g., char oxidation) release sufficient energy to sustain themselves without external heat input, defined intrinsically by fuel chemistry and activation energies. In contrast, smouldering propagation is a global phenomenon involving the spatial and temporal movement of the reaction front through the porous bed, governed by heat and mass transfer. The transition from self-sustained smouldering to propagation requires that heat and mass transfer efficiencies allow the generated energy to preheat adjacent fuel and maintain oxygen supply. Inefficiencies—such as low thermal conductivity delaying heat diffusion or high flow resistance limiting oxygen access—can prevent propagation even if local reactions are exothermic. For instance, in opposed smouldering, oxygen diffusion against the front direction may starve reactions, while in forward smouldering, forced convection enhances oxygen delivery but increases convective losses. Thus, propagation depends on the interplay between local kinetics and global transport, where optima in permeability and thermal properties determine success.",

    "question_text": "Based on the provided paper content, explain how the global energy balance concept for smouldering systems differs from traditional local energy analyses, and describe how this global perspective enables prediction of smouldering fate before global heat exchange effects impact the reaction.",
    "standard_answer": "The global energy balance concept for smouldering systems fundamentally differs from traditional local energy analyses by considering the cumulative integration of energy processes across the entire fuel bed over time, rather than focusing solely on instantaneous local phenomena. Traditional local analyses emphasize processes occurring within thin reaction fronts, such as reaction rates, mass transfer, and local heat exchange. In contrast, the global perspective recognizes that smouldering behavior at the system scale depends on the integral, in space and time, of many key processes. This approach is particularly important for applied smouldering where predicting reaction fate ahead of time allows operators to modify conditions to maintain self-sustained propagation. The global energy balance enables prediction before global heat exchange impacts the reaction because it accounts for the continual feedback between heat and mass transfer processes and chemical kinetics that determines smouldering fate. This cumulative approach considers that the evolution of a smouldering front, while a local process, is determined by a global energy balance that integrates processes across the entire system, allowing operators to anticipate whether conditions will lead to increasing temperatures, self-sustaining propagation, or decaying propagation leading to extinction.",

    "question_text": "How does the global energy balance concept explain the ability to predict smouldering reaction fate before global heat exchange impacts the reaction, and what role does the cumulative integration of processes in space and time play in this prediction?",
    "standard_answer": "The global energy balance concept reveals that smouldering front evolution, while appearing as a local process, is actually determined by a cumulative energy balance integrated over the entire system volume and time. This approach allows prediction of smouldering reaction fate before global heat exchange effects manifest in the reaction. The key insight is that smouldering propagation results from complex heat and mass transfer processes involving exchange of heat, oxygen, and combustion products that enable self-sustained smouldering to propagate through porous media. By considering the integral of energy generation and loss processes across the entire fuel bed and over time, rather than focusing solely on local temperature peaks or instantaneous conditions, operators can anticipate whether smouldering will be self-sustaining or lead to extinction. This predictive capability is particularly valuable in engineered smouldering applications where maintaining self-sustained propagation is essential for harnessing the energy released by the reaction effectively.",

    "question_text": "Based on the provided paper content, explain the significance of the high-temperature exothermic peak that appears above 400°C in air but not in nitrogen during smouldering combustion, and discuss why thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) alone is insufficient for analyzing smouldering propagation despite its ability to identify this peak.",
    "standard_answer": "The emergence of a high-temperature exothermic peak above 400°C in air but not in nitrogen is significant because it corresponds to self-sustained smouldering reactions enabled by extrinsic oxygen. This peak represents oxidative chemical processes that become thermodynamically and kinetically favorable at elevated temperatures, where oxygen from the gas phase can react with char or other degradation products to generate substantial heat release. The presence of this distinct peak in air atmospheres, absent in inert nitrogen environments, demonstrates that oxygen availability fundamentally alters the thermal degradation pathway by activating high-temperature oxidative reactions that contribute significantly to the overall energy release. However, while TGA can identify this peak and differentiate between oxidative and inert atmospheres, it cannot adequately analyze smouldering propagation because smouldering involves complex heat and mass transfer processes throughout porous media that extend beyond the localized chemical reactions measured in TGA. The paper explicitly states that smouldering propagation incorporates distributed heat and mass transfer mechanisms that operate at system scales, making TGA insufficient for capturing the global energy balance and transport phenomena that determine whether smouldering becomes self-sustaining and propagates through a fuel bed.",
