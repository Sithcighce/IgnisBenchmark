Solid-state anaerobic digestion (SS-AD) technology for the conversion of solid organic wastes to renew-
able energy has been widely studied and applied during the past decades. Due to the nature of the solid
medium, the SS-AD process is significantly different from the traditional liquid anaerobic digestion in many
aspects, such as the distribution of microbes and substrates in the reactors, mass transfer, and reaction ki-
netics. Extensive efforts have been dedicated to developing mathematical models for understanding SS-
AD mechanisms, predicting its performance, and improving process control. In this review, SS-AD
mathematical models derived from theoretical, empirical, and statistical approaches are critically re-
viewed and discussed regarding their different assumptions, structures, applications, and limitations. Based
on this review, it was concluded that significant efforts should be devoted to experimental verification of
the model assumptions, measurement of important kinetic parameters specific for SS-AD, and generation
of sufficient data for model validation. It is necessary to synergistically improve modeling and experimen-
tal approaches in order to gain deeper insight into the SS-AD mechanism. Several promising research directions
for the future development of experimental and modeling approaches in SS-AD are proposed.

1. Introduction

1.1. Development of solid-state anaerobic digestion (SS-AD)
technology

Anaerobic digestion (AD) is a biological process in which organic
matter is decomposed by an assortment of microbes in oxygen-
free or oxygen-lean conditions to produce biogas (about 40–70% CH4
and 30–60% CO2) [1]. Since the 1990s, increased energy prices, con-
cerns of global warming, as well as the decreasing capacity of landfills
have stimulated development of AD technology to produce renew-
able energy from various organic wastes, such as the organic fraction
of municipal solid waste (OFMSW), sewage sludge, agricultural resi-
dues, and energy crops [2–5]. Among these, solid organic waste and
lignocellulosic biomass were considered to be the major source of
feedstock for renewable energy production [6–8]. For example in
Germany, the global leader of AD technology, solid organic mate-
rial contributed two-thirds of the total biogas potential (Fig. 1) [3].
As of 2012, there were 9766 agricultural-based biogas plants in
Europe, with 7515 in Germany, and these biogas plants mainly used
maize silage, sugar beet, lawn grass, crop residues, and dedicated
energy crops as feedstocks [3,9].

Based on the operating total solids (TS) content, AD can be
categorized as liquid-AD (L-AD) systems, which operate at TS content
of less than 15%, and solid-state AD (SS-AD) systems that operate
at TS content higher than 15% [10]. L-AD has been widely applied
to treat liquid organic waste, such as sewage sludge, animal manure,
and food processing wastewater [11,12]; while SS-AD is suitable
to handle solid organic materials, such as yard waste, crop resi-
dues, and OFMSW [10,13]. The availabilities and methane yields
for these various substrates have been extensively reviewed [13–15].
Compared with L-AD, SS-AD has the advantages of high solid
loading capacity, increased volumetric biogas productivity, and
reduced energy needs as there is less water to heat [16]. More-
over, SS-AD is free of stratification problems incurred by floating
of fibrous material, and also tolerates inerts, such as sand and
stones [17]. Due to these reasons, SS-AD has captured a higher
market share of the total installed AD capacity in Europe during
the past 20 years, and its dominance has further increased since
2008 (Fig. 2) [18,19].

Various SS-AD technologies have been developed during the past
20 years. Some have been successfully commercialized, while most
of them are still being evaluated at lab or bench scales [13]. These
digesters can be categorized based on the design (vertical, hori-
zontal, inclined), feedstock (single, co-digestion), configurations (one-,
two-, multi-stages), modes of operation (batch, continuous, semi-
continuous), or operating temperature (psychrophilic, mesophilic,
and thermophilic). Biogas injection, internal mechanical agitation,
and pre-mixing/leachate recirculation are three commonly adopted

methods for mixing. Currently, the majority of SS-AD digesters in
Europe operate in the one-stage mode feeding a single feedstock
at mesophilic temperatures [13,18,19]. Several predominant com-
mercial SS-AD systems are listed in Fig. 3. More details for these
technologies, such as installation location and capacity, operating
temperature, and retention time, have been reviewed in previous
publications [13,20].

1.2. SS-AD modeling efforts

Although believed to be a promising technology with multiple
economic and environmental benefits, a major disadvantage of
SS-AD compared to L-AD is the relatively low reaction rate [23,24].
One possible reason is attributed to the slow release of the soluble
substrates for microbial metabolism due to the retarded hydroly-
sis of the solid substrate; the other reason is believed to be the
difficulty of providing sufficient agitation and thus compromised
mass transfer, which reduces the microbial accessibility to sub-
strates and also the dispersion of inhibitors [25–27]. Thus, more
investigation about the mass transfer phenomena in the solid,
liquid, and gas phases in SS-AD is required to improve the efficien-
cy of the process.

To date, the operations of SS-AD systems are usually per-
formed empirically, and there is still a lack of mechanistic tools for
accurate process control [28]. Experimental studies and optimiza-
tion for SS-AD are time consuming and costly due to the demand
for space, equipment, and labor [29,30]. It is commonly agreed that
the application of mathematical models can be used to improve the
engineering process, explain the mechanisms, understand the effects
and interaction of different operating parameters, and predict system
performance [31–33]. Hence, more attention is required for the de-
velopment of adequate mathematical models for SS-AD.

Different SS-AD models have been developed in the past decades
to improve the design of the SS-AD processes [31,33,34]; however,
there is no review summarizing the mathematical models for SS-
AD. Unlike the intensive researches dedicated to L-AD modeling,
which have converged into a unified framework, namely the An-
aerobic Digestion Model No. 1 (ADM1) [35], current theoretical
models proposed for SS-AD are diverse (Fig. 4). The reactor designs,
mass transfer, reaction kinetics, and rate limiting steps in SS-AD are
essentially different from those of the L-AD process [26,36,37]. Thus,
SS-AD modeling needs to take these special features into account
(Table 1). This review evaluates the mathematical approaches for
each SS-AD model based on the analysis of their assumptions, deri-
vations, capacities, and limitations. An overview of the models to
be discussed is summarized in Table 2. Key areas in SS-AD model-
ing that require further research are also discussed. It is our intention
to offer deep insights into the state-of-the-art of the mathematical

working in synergy, as well as multiple physicochemical reac-
tions, such as ion reactions and liquid–gas mass transfer [35,55].
The function of theoretical AD models is to provide a mathemati-
cal foundation for modeling the multiple steps of the biological and
physicochemical reactions in a structured way, where the concen-
tration dynamics of the solid particulate substrates, soluble
substrates, microbes, and end products (biogas) can be simulated
for each step of AD.

The AD process is commonly divided into four sequential steps,
namely hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis, and methanogenesis
[10,11] (Fig. 5), while some researchers have also proposed to include
a step named disintegration before hydrolysis to represent complex
particulate substrate disintegration into small substrate particles and
inert materials [11,35]. In hydrolysis, a key step in ethanol produc-
tion from lignocellulosic biomass [11,56], hydrolytic bacteria excrete
extracellular enzymes to break down complex polymeric organic
matter composed of carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids into soluble
hydrolytic products such as sugars, amino acids, and long chain fatty
acids (LCFAs). These hydrolytic products are subsequently fer-
mented by acidogens into volatile fatty acids (VFAs), H2, and CO2
through a process called acidogenesis [11]. Then, the VFAs and LCFAs
are fermented by acetogens into acetate and CO2 through a process
called acetogenesis. Finally, the acetate and H2/CO2 produced from
previous steps are utilized by acetotrophic and hydrogenotrophic

methanogens
for methane production, which is called
methanogenesis [35]. Some literature does not distinguish
acidogenesis from acetogenesis, combining them as a “fermenta-
tion” step. This three-step process (Fig. 5) is also commonly used
in AD models to reduce the model complexity [57,58].

The complex AD process can be described by a set of differen-
tial equations (Eqs. (1)–(6)). The model concept is shown in Fig. 6.
The subscript i represents different substances (e.g., cellulose, glucose,
acetate), which can be referred to in ADM1 [35], where, for example,
Si and Bi represent the concentration of acetate and acetate con-
suming microbes, respectively, when i is acetate. The model can be
initiated from the hydrolysis of a solid substrate, whose degrada-
tion kinetics is usually simplified as a first-order equation [35,37,59],
namely

of a hydrolytic product j from the hydrolysis of one unit of i.

h

The mass balance for each intermediate substance i in AD systems
can be calculated by the sum ( ∑ ) of the real-time difference between
the production and consumption of i in various degradation path-
ways [35]. For instance, the concentration change of a hydrolytic
product i (e.g., a certain type of sugar, amino acid, or LCFA) can be
described by Eq. (2),

For the final gaseous product i (e.g. CH4, CO2) of AD, its produc-

methanogenesis and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis path-
ways (Eq. (4)).

However, it should be realized that the substrate for the Monod equa-
tion should be only limited to those in dissolved form such as
hydrolytic products, VFAs, and H2/CO2 [60]. Various types of inhi-
bition can also be included into the Monod equation [31,35,59,61].

In fact, Eqs. (1)–(6) are basic kinetic equations that have been

as ADM1. These equations also essentially influenced the develop-

Typical reactors (e.g. single batch reactor) operated at TS content
higher than 20% without effective mixing.

Three phases (solid–liquid–gas).
Mass transfer is severely limited. Diffusion or convection via leachate
flow are assumed as the major forms of mass transfer.
Hydrolysis is usually assumed to be the rate-limiting step.

equations in SS-AD literature. In the following sections, these SS-
AD models are reviewed and discussed.

2.1. SS-AD models derived from Anaerobic Digestion Model No. 1

The ADM1 proposed by the International Water Association is a
structured model system comprising multiple steps, including bio-
chemical and physicochemical reactions involved in AD [35]. The
concept of the system can be simplified as shown in Fig. 7. The bio-
chemical processes in ADM1 include an initial disintegration step of
complex particulate substrates into organic polymers such as cellu-
lose, proteins, and lipids, which is then followed by hydrolysis,
acidogenesis, acetogenesis, and methanogenesis steps. The physico-
chemical steps in ADM1 involve the association/dissociation of ions
and the mass transfer of methane and other gaseous products from
the liquid to the gas phase. After its initial release, ADM1 has been
verified and modified by many L-AD researchers as their basis for
modeling [59,62]. However, the earliest application of ADM1 to SS-
AD has only been traced back to 2011. Currently, three models derived
from ADM1 are available to explain phenomena in SS-AD. The dif-
ferent assumptions and results of these models are discussed below.

2.1.1. Modified ADM1

Research by Abbassi-Guendouz et al. [25] attempted to modify
ADM1 to study the performance of SS-AD using cardboard as a model
substrate with a TS range from 10% to 35%. The modified ADM1

model was first calibrated using methane production data at a TS
of 10% with most of the parameters adopted from literature. The
authors assumed that the first order hydrolysis rate constant in Eq.
(1) decreased with the increase of TS content, because it is com-
monly observed in SS-AD that the overall reaction rate decreases
with TS content [48,63]. However, in order to explain the acidifi-
cation that occurred at TS of 30% and 35%, the authors further
proposed to reduce the volumetric liquid/gas mass transfer coef-
ficient at high TS content to account for the pasty texture of the
substrate–biomass mixture, which trapped CO2, methane, and H2
in the liquid phase and substantially inhibited methanogens.

Abbassi-Guendouz et al. [25] found that both the hydrolysis rate
constant and the volumetric liquid/gas mass transfer coefficient had
to be adjusted much lower compared with L-AD in order to fit the
experimental data at high TS content. For the assumption about the
volumetric liquid/gas mass transfer coefficient, it is understand-
able that the lack of mixing, low biogas bubble formation, and low
moisture content in SS-AD may reduce the mass transfer coeffi-
cient and the specific surface area of the solid–liquid/gas interface.
However, according to the authors, the possible reason for the re-
duction of the hydrolysis rate constant was still unclear. The
experimental results in this study revealed that there was no VFA
accumulation in reactors at 25% TS or lower, thus VFA inhibition on
hydrolysis was precluded. It seems that the reduced hydrolysis rate
constant in this study is still hypothetical and has not been veri-
fied with third party experimental data or alternative experimental

methods [25], such as a direct measurement of the hydrolysis rate
and dissolved gas concentrations in SS-AD. More research is nec-
essary to verify this hypothesis.

2.1.2. Simplified ADM1

As one of the traditional criticisms of ADM1 is its complex model
structure and large number of parameters that cannot be easily de-
termined from experiments [64], Bollon et al. [46] simplified ADM1
to specifically address the biochemical steps, particularly acetate
uptake kinetics, in SS-AD of OFMSW. The model assumed hydro-
lysis (Eq. 1) to be the rate limiting step and that all other steps (except
for methanogenesis) described in Eqs. (2) and (3) proceeded at the
same rate as hydrolysis, thus disintegration, hydrolysis, acidogenesis,
and acetogenesis could be combined into Eq. (1) with acetate as the
final product. The maximum growth rate and microbial cell mass
concentration for methanogens were simplified into one parame-
ter called the “maximum acetate consumption rate”, so that there
was no need to determine the microbial concentration. The exper-
iment was carried out using stabilized solid digestate as the matrix
and 5 g COD kg−1 acetate as the only carbon source, so that the model
only focused on the effect of TS content on acetate utilization, and
its calibration did not include the steps from hydrolysis to
acetogenesis.

Similar to the modified ADM1 adopted by Abbassi-Guendouz
et al. [25], Bollon et al. [46] also proposed that the default values
of ADM1 parameters were not suitable for the SS-AD process, and
adjustments were proposed for the “maximum acetate utilization
rate” and half saturation constant (KS) in the Monod kinetics (Eq.
5) of methanogenesis. Model calibration suggested that the
“maximum acetate utilization rate” should decrease with in-
creased TS content, while the value of KS should increase with the
increase of TS. The authors attributed the decreased KS at high TS
content to the diffusion limitations in the solid medium. Accord-
ing to Monod kinetics, KS is inversely related to the affinity between
the substrate and microorganisms [65]. Therefore, an increased KS
value at high TS content suggested the reduced accessibility of the
substrate to methanogens, and indicated the aggravated diffusion
limitation in SS-AD.

2.1.3. Adapted ADM1

Another SS-AD model, which was proposed by Liotta et al. [47]
based on ADM1, assumed the disintegration rate constant and sub-
strate (i.e. acetate, propionate) uptake rate constants to be linear
functions of TS content [47]. The model was calibrated using methane
production data from AD of food waste (represents an easily di-
gestible substrate) at TS contents of 4.2%, 12.8% and 19.2%, and
rice straw (represents a recalcitrant substrate) at TS contents of
4.8%, 14.8% and 23.4%. This model was in agreement with the models
developed by Abbassi-Guendouz et al. [25] and Bollon et al. [46],
who proposed a decreased hydrolysis rate constant and an in-
creased half saturation constant, respectively, with the increased
TS content in SS-AD. Liotta et al. [47] postulated that the changes
of these kinetic parameters might be caused by the limited mass
transfer of soluble products to bacterial sites due to the lack of
water at high TS content.

2.2. “Two-particle” model

Unlike the aforementioned ADM1 approaches that treated SS-
AD as a homogenous system, the “two-particle” model proposed
by Kalyuzhnyi et al. [38] considered SS-AD to be heterogeneous, and
postulated the existence of two different types of particles inside
the solid mass of SS-AD, namely “seed” and “waste” particles (Fig. 4).
The “seed” particles were inoculum with low biodegradability but

Fig. 8. Illustration of the “two-particle” model.

high methanogenic activity, and the “waste” particles were sub-
strates with high biodegradability but low methanogenic activity.
All “seed” and “waste” particles were assumed to be homogenous
inside and tightly attached to each other. Hydrolysis and acidogenesis
occurred in the “waste” particles and provided VFAs to the “seed”
particles by diffusion of solutes (e.g. VFAs, alcohol) in the liquid phase
(Fig. 8), while the authors assumed no microbial exchange between
particles in this model due to the assumption that no leachate flow
occurs in the reactor, thus there is minimal microbial transloca-
tion in the solid matrix.

It is noteworthy that this is the first SS-AD model that at-
tempted to incorporate the equation of solute diffusion into the basic
model structure. The diffusion rate of VFAs was assumed to follow
Fick’s law and to be affected by concentration gradients of VFAs and
diameters of “seed” and “waste” particles, as suggested by Eq. (7):

where rd (g L−1 s−1) is the diffusion rate of a solute; De (cm2 s−1) is
the effective diffusion coefficient of a solute in the medium; LS and
LW (cm) are the diameters of “seed” and “waste” particles, respec-
tively; and SS and SW (g L−1) are the solute concentrations in the “seed”
and “waste” particles, respectively. The diffusion coefficient for all
solutes was assumed to be 2.0 × 10−6 cm2 s−1, and LS and LW were
both chosen to be 0.5 cm.

In this research, the authors concluded that the rate of solute
transport and the biodegradability of waste are the two most im-
portant factors that influence SS-AD process stability. High diffusion
resistance in a solid medium was considered beneficial in reduc-
ing the rate of VFAs entering the “seed” particles and, in turn, could
mitigate the inhibition of VFAs to methanogens. Based on the model
simulation, the authors also predicted that a 10% increase in the di-
gestibility of the substrate would cause a substantial pH drop and
acidification. As a result, the authors suggested that reactor acidi-
fication could be prevented by either reducing the biodegradability
of substrates through dilution with poorly degradable materials, or
limiting the transport of solute from “waste” to “seed” particles by
spatial separation of the two types of particles [38]. This is a pio-
neering work on a qualitative study of SS-AD modeling, although
the existence of “seed” and “waste” particles has not been exper-
imentally validated.

2.3. “Reaction front” model

Martin [39,66] proposed a “reaction front” model to describe the
poor seeding situations in SS-AD. Similar to the “two-particle” model,
the “reaction front” model also depicted a spatial separation of
acidogenic zones and methanogenic zones. However, Martin pro-
posed that a “seed” particle is not homogenous but actually a “reaction
front” composed of multiple layers (Fig. 4). Outside of the “reaction
front” is a solid substrate that has been rapidly acidified and its further
hydrolysis inhibited by low pH. Interfacing with the acidified waste
is a thin acetogenic zone, in which VFAs are broken down into acetate
under severe acid inhibition. Next to the acetogenic zone is a pH buffer
zone where methanogenesis is completely inhibited [67]. Inside the
buffer zone is a methanogenic zone, where acetate is converted to
methane. Finally, inside this methanogenic zone is a core com-
prised of fully stabilized organic waste. Solutes are assumed to diffuse
between zones following Fick’s law, and the mass transfer between
zones could be rate-limiting for methane production [66].

To mathematically calculate the methane production rate in the
whole SS-AD reactor with various “reaction fronts”, Martin [40] made
the following assumptions: (1) the methanogenic “seed” particles
are initially evenly distributed in the organic waste on a cubic grid
before the reaction starts (Fig. 9); (2) the initial diameter of a “seed”
particle approximates to zero; (3) the “reaction front” has a con-
stant thickness; (4) the “reaction front” advances at a constant rate;
and (5) the SS-AD reaction rate is proportional to the volume of all
“reaction fronts”.

According to this concept model, the SS-AD reaction rate should
experience an acceleration phase and a deceleration phase due to
the changes of the total surface area of “reaction fronts”. Martin [40]
set the radius of a “reaction front” at time (t) to be r (cm) and the
initial distance between each “reaction front” to be 2R (cm) (Fig. 9a).
Thus, the surface area (A, cm2) of each “reaction front” can be cal-

culated as A = 4πr2. During the acceleration phase (r < R), the total
“reaction front” surface area increases with the increase of r (Fig. 9a),
and so does the overall methane production rate. During the de-
celeration phase, r exceeds R and each “reaction front” in a cubic
seeding pattern starts to merge with six others, and the remain-
ing surface area in each “reaction front” decreases with the increase
of r as estimated by Eq. (8) (Fig. 9b). According to this equation, the
surface area of each “reaction front” will decrease with further
growth of r, and the methane production rate will decrease
correspondingly:

Based on this model, Martin et al. [68] concluded that the initial
distribution pattern of the “seed” particles would determine the
process kinetics, and a proper seeding technique should produce
“ideal seed particles” that are just large enough to accommodate
a thick enough buffer layer to resist acidification, and maintain an
adequate number of methanogenic zones. With an estimation of the
maximum possible VFA concentration in AD, Martin et al. [68] cal-
culated that the thickness of the “reaction front” should be over 7 cm
for the methanogens to survive and grow under excessive acid pro-
duction from the surrounding organic waste [69].

This model provided a useful concept to visualize the SS-AD
process, especially in large scale digesters with limited inoculum.
However, it should be pointed out that the existence of the “reac-
tion front”, especially the existence of distinct zones (Fig. 4), has not
been experimentally verified [69]. The model fitness to other SS-
AD processes remains to be tested, and further experimental effort
is also needed to validate model assumptions.

2.4. Distributed model

Based on previous SS-AD models, Vavilin et al. [27,41] devel-
oped a one-dimensional (1D) distributed model that considered mass
transfer by both diffusion and leachate flow. This model assumed ho-
mogeneity along the horizontal direction in the reactor vessel, while
VFA concentrations dynamically changed along the vertical direction
due to downward leachate flow. The distributed model employed
partial differential equations to include both time and spatial varia-
tions. The model structure followed the four AD steps and adopted
reaction kinetics similar to Eqs. (1)–(4). However, in this model,
acidogenesis and acetogenesis were combined into one step, in which
the production rate of acetate is directly correlated with the con-
centration of hydrolytic products by a stoichiometric coefficient χ
(Eqs. (9) and (10)), assuming that fermentation is fast enough to
immediately convert hydrolytic products to acetate, which inhibits
hydrolysis and methanogenesis at high concentrations (Fig. 10). Both
acetate and microbes were considered to be mobile in this model
(Fig. 11), and their concentrations along the vertical direction of the
reactor vessel were modeled as the combined results of diffusion,

order hydrolysis rate constant; S (g L−1) is the concentration of the
soluble substrate (acetate in this study) in the whole system; f(S)
and g(S) are the inhibition functions of acetate to hydrolysis and
microbial growth, respectively; Z (cm) represents the vertical co-
ordinate of the reactor, with the boundary condition defined based
on the total length of the effective volume L (0 ≤ Z ≤ L); DS and DB
(cm2 d−1) are the diffusion coefficients of the soluble substrate (acetate
in this research) and microbes, respectively; q (L cm−2 d−1) is the vol-
umetric liquid flow rate per unit surface area; χ is the stoichiometric
coefficient of different hydrolytic products to acetate; KS (g L−1) is
the half saturation constant of acetate; α is the fraction of micro-

growth yield coefficient over acetate consumption; ρmax (d−1) is the
maximum acetate utilization rate; kd (d−1) is the microbial cell mass
decay coefficient; and γ is the mass fraction of methane in biogas.
In Vavilin’s following studies, further improvements of the model
were proposed by using Contois kinetics for hydrolysis, and split-
ting the solid substrate X into easily digestible organic matter and
recalcitrant organic matter with two different hydrolysis rate con-
stants [36,37]. These two approaches did not significantly increase
model complexity, but were especially suitable for lignocellulosic
biomass composed of extractives, cellulose, and hemicellulose which
have different hydrolysis rates, and for co-digestion systems with
both easily digestible substrates and recalcitrant ones.

based on the concept of the “reaction front” model and the struc-
ture of the distributed model. This model was able to simulate and
visually demonstrate how the initial spatial distribution of sub-
strate and inoculum affect the expansion of methanogenic centers
in the digester, by using a three-dimensional (3D) regime with the
spatial resolution fine enough to resolve each “reaction front”
(Fig. 12). The transition from fresh substrate to stabilized digestate
in a given region was assumed to be the result of the advance-
ment of the “reaction front”.

This spatial–temporal model followed the basic concept of the
distributed model (Eqs. (9)–(12)) and included both diffusion and
leachate flow for mass transfer, as well as VFA inhibition (Eqs.
(13)–(16)). However, for simplicity Monod kinetics (Eq. (5)) was not
adopted by this model to describe the microbial cell mass growth
and VFA uptake [44].

spectively; and DG (>0) is the diffusion coefficient of biogas.

In order to mathematically depict the changes of substrate and
microbial concentrations at each point within the 3D structure of the
SS-AD reactor, the concentrations of X, S, and B at each time step were
calculated separately using an outer iteration loop without simul-
taneously solving the partial differential equations [44,45]. This study
simulated the expansion of the “reaction front” in a 3D space for the
first time, and demonstrated how initial inoculation size and distri-
bution affect the overall degradation rate of solid waste in SS-AD.
While the model simulation is impressive, the simulation results were
not validated with experimental data.

2.5. Spatial–temporal model

A spatial–temporal model [44] was developed to study the effect
of the heterogeneous mass distribution on the SS-AD reaction rate

Considering TS to be an essential factor governing SS-AD kinet-
ics, Xu et al. [26] developed a mathematical model to interpret the
effect of TS content on AD of lignocellulosic substrates. The

include the first-order kinetics for hydrolysis (e.g., Eqs. (1), (9), and
(13)), and equations derived from Monod kinetics for microbial
growth/ substrate uptake/ product generation (e.g., Eq. (5), (10)–(12)).
However, these kinetic equations are only mathematical simplifi-
cations of complex SS-AD steps and additional modifications are
required based on model assumptions. Many publications before
2005 (Sections 2.2–2.5) proposed various VFA inhibition functions
and mass transfer of VFAs and microbes in the liquid phase by dif-
fusion or leachate flow [37,41]. All of these models (“two-particle”,
“reaction front”, distributed, and spatial–temporal) tried to em-
phasize the necessity of initial spatial separation of the methanogenic
centers from active acidogenic areas at high organic loadings [42,43].
Based on model simulation results in these studies, highly dis-
persed inoculum, vigorous mixing, and leachate recirculation were
shown to be unfavorable for SS-AD, because under these condi-
tions, the inoculum particles are more easily acidified by the
excessive VFAs produced [42]. Following these models, recent models
are mostly focused on the interpretation of the effect of TS content
on the methane production rate and ultimate yield, and several im-
portant kinetic rate constants are proposed to be influenced by the
TS content (Sections 2.1 and 2.6). Generally, these models empha-
sized the importance of the mass transfer process in SS-AD, and the
necessity of incorporating mass transfer in an SS-AD tailored model
beyond the scope of previous AD models such as ADM1.

3. SS-AD models derived from empirical approaches

3.1. Logistic model

Most of the SS-AD models introduced above tried to give a the-
oretical but complex description of the bioconversion mechanism
with multiple biochemical reactions and mass transfer processes.
However, criticism has arisen that limited experimental measure-
ments cannot lead to reliable determination of so many model
parameters [48]. Thus, a much simpler SS-AD model with a limited
number of parameters was proposed by Pommier et al. [48] to
predict methane production from SS-AD.

The simplification was made by assuming that (1) only the mi-
crobial concentration (B) is responsible for methane production; (2)
the growth of microbes is limited by some factors such as the hy-
drolysis rate and substrate availability; and (3) inhibition and the
decay of microbes are not considered. The model was developed
based on a logistic equation (Eq. (19)) that fits the global shape of
the biogas production kinetics in batch SS-AD (Fig. 14), i.e., an initial

foundation of this model was in line with the “two-particle” and
“reaction front” concepts as it assumed SS-AD is initiated from nu-
merous pinpoint microflora inoculated into the substrate. During
AD, each microflora releases extracellular hydrolytic enzymes into
the surrounding substrate layer and converts cellulose and hemi-
cellulose into sugars. These sugars diffuse from the lignocellulosic
biomass particles toward the microflora due to concentration gra-
dients, and are consumed by the synergistically congregated
microbial communities in each microflora (Fig. 13).

Hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass (Eq. (1)) was assumed to
be inhibited by hydrolytic products such as glucose, and an empir-
ical equation (Eq. (17)) was proposed for hydrolysis inhibition:

r
i

(17)

where ri (g L−1d−1) is the hydrolysis rate reduction due to inhibi-
tion; ki (d−1) is the hydrolysis inhibition coefficient; and S (g L−1) is
the concentration of soluble hydrolytic products such as sugars.

After hydrolysis, sugars diffuse from the substrate layer to the

microflora based on Fick’s law (Eq. (18)),

(18)

in which rd (g L−1d−1) is the diffusion rate of sugars; De (cm2 d−1) is
the diffusion coefficient; A (cm2) is the surface area of the micro-
flora; L (μm) is the thickness of the effective zone of enzymatic
hydrolysis; V (L) is the volume of the substrate layer around each
microflora; and ′S (g L−1) is the sugar concentration inside the
microflora.

Recognizing that model verification was a challenge in all pre-
vious SS-AD modeling studies, Xu et al. [26] were able to validate
the volumetric methane production rate of the model using exper-
imental data collected from three independent sources. Based on
this model, Xu et al. [26] concluded that there is a TS content thresh-
old between 15% and 20%, below which the volumetric methane
production rate tends to increase with TS content as governed by
the Monod kinetics, but decreases when the TS content exceeds the
threshold, due to hydrolysis inhibition caused by the diffusion lim-
itation of sugars. It should be pointed out that, even though Xu et al.
[26] exploited multiple sets of experimental data for indirect model
verification, some of the assumptions still need to be validated
experimentally.

Generally, all SS-AD theoretical models need a series of inputs,
such as the values of some model-specific initial conditions (e.g.,
X0, B0, S0, X0/B0 ratio) that can be measured or designed, and kinetic
constants (e.g., Ks, μmax, De) that can be obtained from model cali-
bration or from literature. The popular kinetics used in these models

Pommier et al. [48] postulated that inside the solid substrate,
the portion of water that is physically adsorbed to the solid surface
and capillaries is not available for biological metabolism and solute
transport, thus only the portion of substrate saturated with water
is accessible for methane production. Accordingly, they assumed two
parameters to be linearly related to moisture content: the micro-
bial maximal specific growth rate μmax and the amount of accessible
organic matter X0. The water content (ω) was empirically corre-
lated to μmax and X0 in Eq. (19) via Eqs. (20) and (21).

These equations suggest that if the actual water content ω exceeds
the water holding capacity ωR, all the solid substrate X0 is accessi-
ble to microbes, and the optimal maximum specific growth rate
μmax
can be reached. While below the minimal water content ωmin,
no bioconversion is possible (X0 = 0 and μmax = 0). When ω ranges
between ωmin and ωR, both X0 and μmax cannot reach their optimal
values and are directly proportional to the water content.

This model provided a new perspective on the effect of TS content
on SS-AD. The model was calibrated using paper and cardboard as the
substrate with TS content ranging from about 6% to 80%. Results showed
that the water holding capacity (ωR) of the substrate was at 34% water
content, and the minimal water content required for bioconversion (ωmin)
was 60%. However, some assumptions such as the reduced amount of
accessible substrate at low water content need direct validation.

3.2. General kinetic model

Due to the good fit to AD experimental data, a general kinetic
model was recently adopted by Fernández et al. [49] and Fdez-
Güelfo et al. [33] for SS-AD research (Fig. 14). This model was first
proposed for a general fermentation process, and the foundation
of this model was based on the simplified biochemical reaction rate
law (Eq. (22)) [70]:

maximum microbial cell mass concentration that can be reached.
By associating the substrate utilization rate in the reactor with
the methane production rate, this integrated model can provide a
general kinetics for methane generation in AD as shown in Eq. (26):

This model was adopted by Fernández et al. [49] to study the
effect of TS content on the SS-AD process. By fitting the model to
methane production data from SS-AD experiments with OFMSW
at TS of 20% and 30%, Fernández et al. [49] found that μmax at 20%
TS (0.265 d−1) was significantly higher than that at 30% TS (0.147
d−1). This mechanism is similar to the models proposed by Abbassi-
Guendouz et al. [25], Liotta et al. [47], and Pommier et al. [48], who
assumed the TS content affected the coefficients of microbial growth
kinetics. Further studies are required to validate these assumptions.
Fdez-Güelfo et al. [33] modified the general kinetic model to study
the SS-AD of OFMSW at thermophilic temperature, based on a semi-
continuous stirred tank reactor (SSTR). The objectives of this reseach
were to obtain the kinetics parameters under the steady state of SSTR
at thermophlic temperature, and then verify the model at non-
steady state conditions. Two types of substrates and four different
organic loading rates were used for model validation and the ulti-
mate goal of this research was to use the verified model for further
process design and optimization. This model might be the first
attempt to develop an SS-AD model for a thermophilic and con-
tinuous process.

The SS-AD empirical models discussed above are modifica-
tions of the logistic equation or the modified Gompertz equation,
which are two common models used for bioenergy production that
involves microbial growth such as AD, fermentation, and biohydrogen
production [71–73]. Both models can obtain important process
kinetic paramters such as the lag phase time, maximum growth rate,
and utimate yield potential. However, the modified Gompertz model
is purported to have obtained a better fit to experimental data than
other sigmoidal microbial growth models such as the Logistic, Rich-
ards, Schnute, and Stannard kinetics [71,72,74]. As a result, the
modified Gompertz model seems to be more widely used for
AD. Currently there have been no direct comparison of the afore-
mentioned sigmoidal microbial growth models for their fit to SS-
AD data.

where k is the rate constant of the process; X (g L−1) is the concen-
tration of dissolved organic carbon in solid substrate; B (g L−1) is the
concentration of microbes expressed in dissolved organic carbon;
and Γ is a stoichiometric constant. Accordingly, the following equa-
tions can be derived:

Besides the theoretical and empirical approaches discussed above,
statistical approaches have also been used to predict the system per-
formance in SS-AD under different operating conditions. Compared
with the aforementioned models, statistical models do not require
a deep understanding of the biological or physicochemical pro-
cesses, and can be much easier to develop and simpler to use [14,29].

In well controlled AD experiments that have only a few signif-
icant explanatory variables, simple linear regression is commonly
used to correlate these variables to the response variables. In
some previous studies about SS-AD of lignocellulosic biomass, a
linear relationship was found between lignin content and methane
yield [50]. Enzymatic digestibility of lignocellulosic biomass has
also been correlated with methane yield, with an R2 ranging from
0.86 to 0.99 [50–52]. However, given the limited data used in
these studies, the coefficients obtained might not be applicable to
other studies.

4.2. Multiple linear regression models

A quadratic multiple linear regression (MLR) model was devel-
oped by Motte et al. [53] to evaluate how TS content, inoculation
ratio, particle size of lignocellulosic biomass, and their interac-
tions affect SS-AD performance (Fig. 15a). The explanatory variables
were represented by xi and each was associated with a coefficient
ai. Their relationships with each response variables y (CH4 produc-
tion, pH, and VFAs, respectively) were analyzed according to Eq.
(27). A three level Box–Behnken experimental design was imple-
mented in an SS-AD batch study using wheat straw as a model
substrate, with TS from 15% to 25%, an inoculation ratio (substrate
to inoculum ratio) from 28 to 47, and particle size from 0.1 to
1.4 mm [53].

interactions of particle size × inoculation ratio and particle size × TS
were found to be significant factors (p < 0.05). Intriguingly, the effect
of inoculation ratio was found to be more predominant during the
start-up phase (first 60 days) of SS-AD. During the growing phase,
TS content became the main parameter governing methane pro-
duction. This model revealed the interactions between inoculation
ratio, TS, and particle size have significant effects on methane yield
and VFA production, and provided a useful method for identifying
influential factors during digester operation.

Another MLR model was developed by Xu et al. [54] for SS-AD
of lignocellulosic biomass based on both substrate characteristics
and process parameters. In this research, 11 common explanatory
variables (inoculation ratio, carbon-to-nitrogen ratio, volatile solids
(VS), TS, cellulose, lignin, xylan, extractives, particle size, total
ammonia nitrogen, and alkalinity of the inoculum) were analyzed
for their correlations with the cumulative methane yield obtained
from batch tests. Among these parameters, the inoculation ratio and
the contents of lignin, cellulose, and extractives in the substrate were
found to be essential in accurately determining the 30-day cumu-
lative methane yield. The interaction between inoculation ratio and
lignin content was also found to be significant by MLR analysis. This
is the first statistical model in SS-AD that considered both the sub-
strate characteristics and operating parameters. However, only the
inoculation ratio was found to be significant in this study due to
the limited data available for other operating parameters, such as
TS content and temperature.

models (b).

Xu et al. [54] compared artificial neural network (ANN) models
with MLR models for the prediction of methane yield of lignocel-
lulosic biomass in batch SS-AD (Fig. 15b). Three artificial neural
network models were established using: (1) 11 commonly mea-
sured variables (inoculation ratio, carbon-to-nitrogen ratio, VS,
cellulose, lignin, xylan, extractives, particle size, TS, total ammonia
nitrogen, and alkalinity of the inoculum); (2) significant variables
identified by MLR, including inoculation ratio and contents of
cellulose, lignin and extractives; and (3) easily measurable vari-
ables, including inoculation ratio, carbon-to-nitrogen ratio, TS, VS,
and particle size. The authors found that for a satisfactory simula-
tion, both MLR and ANN methods have to use those significant
variables, and ANN obtained a better model in terms of the lowest
standard error for prediction [54]. Using a large number of insig-
nificant variables caused an over-fitting problem and obtained
good results in model calibration, while the calibrated model had
poor performance when tested with new data [75]. This model
attempted to consider both substrate characteristics and operat-
ing parameters as explanatory variables, and was the first attempt
to use ANN for SS-AD. However, essential data are missing from
literature regarding TS and temperature, thus both parameters
could not be included in the model.

MLR has been proved to be a useful tool to predict methane yields
and biochemical methane potential (BMP) of different substrates
based on their chemical compositions [14,30,52,76]. Most of these
studies were usually under L-AD conditions with a low TS content,
thus are not reviewed in this paper. Analyzing AD processes using
MLR can help identify significant variables, and thus achieve the
needed monitoring and prediction accuracy with reduced labor and
time. According to the literature, although in some AD processes a
single parameter, such as lignin content, can be dominant and a
simple linear regression is good enough to predict methane yields,
in most cases, AD is a complicated process where multiple param-
eters are required to model the process [75,77–79]. This is especially
true when operating parameters of SS-AD are considered in the
model.

62

F. Xu et al./Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 51 (2015) 49–66

MLR can be a good option if the explanatory variables are only
a few, not significantly redundant, and have a well-understood re-
lationship with the response variables [80]. In contrast, ANN offers
the ability to predict system performance from non-linear, redun-
dant, and complicated data inputs, as long as enough data can be
obtained for each explanatory variable [75]. As a promising tool for
data mining, ANN has been attracting great interest as a predic-
tive tool for the complicated AD system [81]. However, both linear
regression and ANN are black-box models that cannot provide much
understanding of SS-AD mechanisms.

5. Conclusion and remarks

5.1. Comparison of different types of models for SS-AD

Mathematical modeling is always an objective-driven exercise.
In general, the three most common objectives in using a mathe-
matical model are: (i) understanding system behavior and
component interactions; (ii) quantitatively verifying a hypothesis;
and (iii) predicting the behavior of the system in the future or under
other similar circumstances. SS-AD models derived theoretically, em-
pirically, or statistically have all tried to fulfill one or more of these
objectives, and have improved the understanding of different aspects
of the process. However, only the first two objectives have been com-
monly pursued, while the prediction of system behavior is relatively
hard to achieve, probably due to the complexity of SS-AD pro-
cesses, and the limitation of experimental and mathematical
instrumentations. Statistically derived models may emphasize pre-
diction of system behavior, and are especially useful when there are
a limited number of targeting outputs, while the models are black-
box models and might not provide enough information to unveil
system mechanisms. On the other hand, theoretical models provide
more insight into the complex system mechanisms, while simpli-
fication is required to find general applications [31,82].

Different SS-AD models are classified and summarized in Tables 2
and 3. SS-AD models derived from ADM1 generally assume ho-
mogenous and complete mixing in the system, while heterogeneous
distribution of inoculum and substrate is assumed in other theoretical

SS-AD models. In SS-AD models derived from ADM1 and empiri-
cal approaches, TS content was considered to be an essential factor
that directly affects the value of key model parameters, such as the
hydrolysis rate constant [25] [47], maximum microbial growth rate
or half saturation coefficient KS [47–49], and diffusion coefficient
[25,26]. Results of statistical modeling of SS-AD also indicate the
TS content was an important factor affecting methane production
[53,54].

Currently, there is no universal consensus of the best modeling
approach for SS-AD. The diversity in SS-AD modeling is much dif-
ferent from the modeling of L-AD, in which a general framework
ADM1 proposed by the International Water Association has reached
a broad acceptance [35]. Based on this critical review, the authors
would like to remark that significant progress has been made in un-
derstanding SS-AD processes. However, as pointed out by Zhu et al.
[83], reaction mechanisms in SS-AD, such as the influences of TS
content, substrate composition, temperature, mass transfer, and heat
transfer, are still not clear [10]. Further investigation of SS-AD mecha-
nisms is essential for the rational construction of SS-AD mathematical
models.

5.2. Limitations and future research

Mathematical models have to be inferred from prior knowl-
edge and experimental data. Hence, the experimental verification
for models is of paramount importance. However, one of the major
challenges for current SS-AD models is the lack of experimental data.
The heterogeneous nature of SS-AD makes it difficult to collect in-
formative experimental data by traditional experimental
instrumentation. More experimental studies should be conducted
based on the platform of SS-AD to give enough insight into its mech-
anism. In addition, databases should be established for SS-AD
research to better utilize the previously accumulated knowledge con-
tributed by researchers across the world. As can be expected, the
utilization of modern experimental and computational instrumen-
tation is highly promising when combined with mathematical
modeling approaches to study SS-AD, and the following aspects are
proposed as future studies.

Reduced waste digestibility and mass transfer
rate could potentially reduce the extent of seed
acidification in SS-AD.
A minimum thickness of the “reaction front” is
required to prevent acid inhibition to
methanogens.
The optimum operation strategy for SS-AD is to
gradually increase the leachate recirculation rate
during the startup.
Spatial distribution of inoculum significantly
affects the rate of substrate degradation.
Some mass transfer or microbial growth related
kinetic coefficients in L-AD need to be adjusted
with TS content to fit SS-AD data.
Reaction rate increases with TS following Monod
kinetics until a threshold is reached and then
decreased due to diffusion limitation.

The maximal specific growth rate of microbes
and substrate accessibility to microbes are
related to TS content.

Both substrate characteristics and operating
parameters affect SS-AD. Operating parameters
have complicated relationships with reactor
performance.

5.2.1. Experimental verification of SS-AD model assumptions

Assumptions are the foundation of SS-AD model development,
and more effective experimental methods should be explored to
verify current model assumptions, such as the rate limiting steps,
the spatial distribution of microbial consortia and substrate in the
reactor vessel, and the changes of substrate metabolic rate con-
stants under different TS contents. The assumption of the
heterogeneity of microbial community distribution within the solid
substrate of SS-AD may be determined using various 16s/18s ribo-
somal RNA/DNA gene based biomarkers, and the dynamic changes
of the microbial community distribution in the solid substrates may
be directly observed by various microscope imaging technologies
[84–86]. For example, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using
DNA/RNA based probes combined with epifluorescent light mi-
croscopy or confocal laser microscopy can be used to locate and
quantify anaerobic microbes in the solid substrate matrix [87–89];
while changes of morphological characteristics of solid substrate
during biodegradation can be observed using scanning electron mi-
croscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and atomic force
microscopy [90]. Using the aforementioned technologies, assump-
tions about how operating conditions (e.g., TS content and
temperature) affect the microbial growth kinetics can also be ex-
perimentally determined by correlating the targeted parameters with
the behavior of the microbial community and feedstock degrada-
tion [24,91,92].

Another important assumption in SS-AD models is related to the
rate-limiting steps and reaction pathways, which are widely used
for model simplification. However, usually only the final products
(e.g., CH4) can be measured for model calibration. To verify the model
assumptions regarding rate-limiting steps, direct determination of
the reaction rate of each intermediate step and substrate metabol-
ic pathways in SS-AD can be done using isotope-labeled substrates,
such as 1H and 13C labeled glucose, cellulose, starch, and organic acids
[93,94]. Subsequently, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spec-
troscopy can be used to trace the degradation of these isotope-
labeled substrates [94,95]. The concentrations of substrates and
inhibitors, such as VFAs, can be measured in situ using near infra-
red spectroscopy (NIR) and correlated with the in situ distribution
of microbes [84,96].

It should be noted that due to the solid nature of the SS-AD
medium, established analytical techniques used for similar systems,
such as soil [97], rumen [87,89,90,98], solid-state fungi pretreat-
ment of lignocellulosic biomass [86], compost [99], and solid state
fermentation [100,101], could be adopted as useful experimental
tools for the verification of SS-AD model assumptions.

5.2.2. Determination of important model coefficients

A major problem that arises in SS-AD modeling is that most of
the parameters were obtained from L-AD literatures without veri-
fying the reliability, and many key parameters were arbitrarily
chosen. The diffusion coefficient (De) of a solute in SS-AD is an
example. This is an essential parameter that primarily differenti-
ates SS-AD from L-AD in kinetic modeling. However, a broad range
of values have been used in current SS-AD models without exper-
imental verification. Kalyuzhnyi et al. [38] adopted the value of
2.00 × 10−6 cm2 s−1 for the diffusion coefficient; Vavilin et al. [27] used
the value of 1.73 × 10−6 cm2 s−1; Eberl [45] chose the value to be
2.78 × 10−5 cm2 s−1; and Xu et al. [26] estimated it to be in a range
up to 10−7 cm2 s−1 with TS increases. The work by Bollon et al. [102]
might be the only study that experimentally estimated the mag-
nitude of the effective diffusion coefficient in SS-AD. Using a
potassium iodide tracer, they found the coefficient to be around
1 × 10−7 cm2 s−1, which was 200 times smaller than that in pure water
(1.98 × 10−5 cm2 s−1). However, the diffusion coefficient of inorgan-
ic salts can be very different from that of the actual organic

substances in SS-AD, such as sugars, VFAs, enzymes, and mi-
crobes. The direct measurement of the De of those intermediate
products in SS-AD can be challenging as they are bioconvertable.
Further studies are necessary to develop appropriate tracers to sim-
ulate the diffusion of organic molecules in SS-AD for accurate
determination of the diffusion coefficient. Candidate tracers include
those that have been used for fluorescence recovery after photo-
bleaching [103,104], or radioactive tracers that measure solute
migration through barriers [105].

5.2.3. Determination of actual concentration of solutes

There are usually three physicochemical processes involved in
AD: (1) liquid–liquid reactions (i.e. ion association/dissociation); (2)
gas–liquid mass transfer; and (3) liquid–solid transformations (i.e.
precipitation and solubilization) [35]. However, the third process
is typically ignored in L-AD model development, which is under-
standable due to its highly diluted nature. However, precipitation
might become prominent in SS-AD when the water content is so
low that the solutes can easily reach saturation. Calculation of the
actual solute concentrations and their ionic forms in the liquid phase
of the SS-AD medium might be essential for accurate determina-
tion of the medium pH and the concentrations of soluble substrates
and inhibitors, which are important factors affecting biogas pro-
duction of SS-AD. Due to the difference of densities between
substrate and inoculum, the change of inoculation ratio also affects
the operational volume of SS-AD reactor which should also be con-
sidered in the modeling.

5.2.4. Development of inhibition functions for SS-AD

Another important aspect that needs further study in SS-AD is
the inhibition kinetics. Most of the inhibition functions in SS-AD
models are adopted from L-AD studies, assuming no concentra-
tion gradients within the entire reactor. In SS-AD systems, the lack
of mixing may cause aggravated accumulation of inhibitors in the
solid medium. Hence, high concentration gradients and uneven dis-
tribution of various inhibitors may exist in reactors. In this regard,
the microbial tolerance to inhibitors might be significantly differ-
ent in SS-AD in comparison with L-AD [61,73], and the inhibition
functions for SS-AD need further evaluation.

5.2.5. Models for scaled-up applications

Further efforts should be also devoted to the modeling of scaled-
up SS-AD processes. To-date, most of the SS-AD models were
developed based on lab-scale studies, while the scaled-up SS-AD
systems are expected to experience significantly more heteroge-
neity in mass distribution and heat transfer. Although some models
have considered vertical leachate flow, none of the existing SS-AD
models have taken heat transfer into consideration [106]. In addi-
tion, most of the current SS-AD models are based on the batch
process, and only one empirical model was found to simulate con-
tinuous SS-AD during startup and steady state [33]. Limited
information was found for the kinetic parameters in the thermo-
philic SS-AD process, which was reported to be more sensitive to
environmental changes and difficult to control. As both continu-
ous and thermophilic SS-AD processes comprise a significant share
in the SS-AD market [19], more modeling efforts should be devoted
to these types of processes.

5.2.6. Combination of different approaches for SS-AD modeling

Theoretical, empirical, and statistical models can be combined
to more accurately model SS-AD processes. The empirical/statistical
approaches can be used to determine some key model parameters
such as the coefficients for microbial growth and mass transfer. The
mechanisms obtained from the theoretical modeling can also guide
the development of regression models in the empirical/statistical
modeling to improve the accuracy and capability of the models.

64

F. Xu et al./Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 51 (2015) 49–66

These models can be incorporated with computational fluid dy-
namics (CFD) models. CFD provides a useful tool to model mass and
heat transfer in AD, and it is especially useful to simulate the mass
transfer in a three-phase system such as SS-AD, which is com-
posed of solid, liquid, and gas phases. CFD has been successfully used
for L-AD systems [107], large scale bio-ethanol fermentations [108],
and solid degradation processes such as composting [109]. The the-
oretical and empirical models can provide the chemical and biological
kinetics for each element of the CFD models. With the combina-
tion of these kinetic models with the heat and mass transfer
equations in CFD models, the biogas production can be predicted
to optimize the design and operating parameters of SS-AD systems.
CFD could facilitate the better understanding of the SS-AD funda-
mentals and the application of scaled-up SS-AD systems. In addition,
various modeling efforts developed for ethanol fermentation may
also provide useful information for SS-AD modeling, due to the sim-
ilarity of substrates and the process of initial hydrolysis, as well as
the three-phase mass transfer between solid, liquid, and gas [56,110].

5.2.7. Build-up of a shared database for SS-AD modeling

Most of the SS-AD models developed so far lack cross-verification
using data from independent sources. Increased data collection is
necessary for future SS-AD model development. Significant amounts
of data have been published for L-AD model verification and vali-
dation [1,13,37,61], but information available for SS-AD is still
relatively limited. Hence, the publication, collection, and analysis
of more SS-AD data should be helpful to provide insight to SS-AD
model development and validation. Coordination and data sharing
between research groups are essential to fully exploit the value of
previously published data.
