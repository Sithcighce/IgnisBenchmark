    "question_text": "Using the provided paper content, analyze how the non-Newtonian nature of phosphor gel affects the fluid flow characteristics during LED packaging coating processes. Explain why proper fluid flow control is essential for achieving uniform optical performance in white LED packages, specifically addressing how fluid properties influence the final phosphor morphology and distribution.",
    "standard_answer": "The phosphor coating process in LED packaging represents a complex fluid dynamics problem where the non-Newtonian behavior of phosphor gel significantly impacts flow characteristics and final optical performance. According to the paper, 'Phosphor gel is a kind of non-Newton fluid and its coating process is a typical fluid-flow problem.' This non-Newtonian nature means the viscosity changes with shear rate during dispensing, directly affecting how the gel flows and spreads over the LED chip surface. The paper emphasizes that 'The flowing property of the phosphor gel should be well considered in the phosphor coating process in LED packaging' because improper control leads to variations in phosphor layer morphology and particle distribution. These fluid dynamics aspects are critical since 'phosphor gel morphology and particle distribution play important roles in determining the final optical characteristics of white LED packages.' When fluid flow is not properly controlled, the resulting non-uniform coating causes optical defects and poor color characteristics in the final LED product, highlighting the essential relationship between fluid behavior and optical performance.",
