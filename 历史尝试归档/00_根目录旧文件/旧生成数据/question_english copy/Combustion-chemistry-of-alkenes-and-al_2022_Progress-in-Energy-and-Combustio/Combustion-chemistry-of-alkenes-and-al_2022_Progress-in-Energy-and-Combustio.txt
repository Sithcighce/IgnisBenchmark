Alkenes formed, during the refining of crude oil, by cracking the heavier fractions are present in transportation
fuels  in  significant  amounts,  up  to  as  much  as  15–20%  in  gasoline.  Moreover,  alkenes  are  also  the  major  in-
termediate  products of  the oxidation of  alkanes, which play a significant role in  autoignition chemistry. This
review has assessed the recent progress in gas-phase detailed kinetic model development for species with C=C
double  bond,  mostly  C2–C10  alkenes  and  1,3-butadiene.  The  compiled  knowledge  on  alkene  combustion
chemistry enabled a better understanding of the influence of the number and the position of the C=C double
bond on the chemical kinetics and hence combustion behavior of alkenes in engines. At first, the article gives an
extensive overview of fundamental combustion experiments by considering studies of C2–C10 alkenes and 1,3-
butadiene in shock tubes, rapid compression machines, laminar flames, and jet-stirred and flow reactors. The
value of the data from such experiments is critically discussed. Secondly, this article highlights the important
reaction classes involved in alkene oxidation over low-, intermediate- and high-temperature ranges. Combustion
chemistry covering C2 to C10 alkenes, with a special emphasis on C2 to C7 isomers is discussed by presenting a
large body of experimental and modeling investigations. Detailed chemistry differences between alkene isomers
and  also  between  alkenes  and  alkanes  are  also  addressed.  Thirdly,  the  article  presents  important  reaction
pathways for PAH precursor formation in different alkenes. Finally, a summary of the distinguishing features of
alkene combustion chemistry and an outlook towards future research in this area are presented. This review is
focused on linear and branched chain alkenes, and the chemistry of cyclo-alkenes is not included.

1. Introduction

The combustion of fossil fuel accounts for more than 80% of global
primary energy utilization [1,2] and the related environmental issues
instigate increasing concerns worldwide. Emissions from the fossil fuel
combustion  processes  significantly  influence  the  air  quality,  environ-
ment, climate, and human health [1,2]. They cause severe air pollution
and  contribute  to  anthropogenic  carbon  dioxide  [3,4].  In  2019,  the
measured globally averaged CO2  concentration at Earth’s surface was
409.8 ± 0.1 ppm. The average annual growth of global mean CO2 during
2009–2018 was 2.3 ppm/year, while a higher increase of 2.5 ± 0.1 ppm
in global mean CO2 was observed during the year 2018 [4]. From 1850
to 2018, fossil fuel combustion was responsible for 440 ± 20 Pg C (1 Pg
C = 1015 g C) equivalent CO2 emission. Within the year 2018, global CO2

emission from fossil fuel combustion reached 10 ± 0.5 Pg C/year, the
highest value in history [5]. However, CO2 is not the only pertinent issue
regarding combustion emissions. Take black carbon for example, which
is  particulate  soot  emitted  from  the  combustion  of  fossil  fuels  for
transportation, solid fuels for industrial and residential uses, and open
burning  of  biomass.  Black  carbon  can  impact  the  climate  change
significantly [6] and has been reported to be among the most prominent
global health hazard factors [7–9] contributing notably to such risks as
diseases of the respiratory and cardiovascular systems. A more detailed,
fundamental understanding of the chemistry of combustion may lead to
cleaner  and  more  efficient  strategies  in  automotive  vehicle  and  fuel
design.

Alkenes,  formed  during  the  refining  of  crude  oil  to  gasoline  by
cracking the heavier fractions, are present in transportation fuels, up to

as  much  as  15–20%  in  gasoline  [10].  Typical  alkene  compositions  in
gasoline  range  from  C5  to  C8  isomers,  where  branched  alkenes  (e.g.,
methyl-butenes and methyl-pentenes) prevail over linear ones [11,12].
They  contribute to  determining  the  ignition  properties  of  those  fuels,
including  the  octane  numbers  that  measure  resistance  to  knocking
behavior in spark-ignition engines and build-up of pollutants [10]. Short
chain alkenes have a much higher knock resistance than their saturated
homologues [13], but at high concentrations they can alter the stability
of the fuel and promote the formation of gums, detrimental for engine
injectors. On the other hand, combustion properties of alkenes should be
a  concern  regarding  the  safety  against  fire  hazard  in  chemical  and
petrochemical  industry.  For  example,  the  industrial  production  of  a
versatile chemical, ethylene oxide, through the vapor-phase epoxidation
of ethylene in air or pure oxygen could present a nonnegligible fire and
explosion  risk  due  to  the  low  explosion  limit  and  wide  flammability
range of ethylene/air mixtures [14,15].

Alkenes  also  serve  as  potential  fuels  or  propellants  for  novel  pro-
pulsion systems. For instance, scramjets in pursuit of hypersonic speeds
can be fueled by ethylene. One of the principal issues in scramjet design
is maintaining stabilized combustion in the combustion chamber, which
is considerably correlated with the efficient mixing of fuel and oxidizer
and the reactivity of the mixtures. Hence, the ignition properties and
flame  stabilization  characters  of  ethylene  under  scramjet-relevant
operation  conditions  have  been  investigated  by  a  number  of  studies
[16–19]. In the concept of rotating detonation engine (RDE), pressure
gain combustion is aided by detonations in circular motion, which leads
to  higher  efficiency  compared  with  deflagration  combustion  modes.
Other than hydrogen, ethylene has been utilized as the fuel for RDE in
many experimental and modeling efforts [20,21]. Feasibility of contin-
uously  rotating  detonation  waves  is  a  critical  research  topic  in  RDE
development. It largely depends on the operation conditions and is quite
sensitive to the mass flow rate and equivalence ratio [22], and intrin-
sically governed by the reactions of the fuel. Therefore, thorough un-
derstandings of the detailed reaction mechanism of alkenes would be
helpful  in  unraveling  the  physics  behind  these  novel  combustion
technologies.

Alkenes are also the major intermediate products of the oxidation of
alkanes, which play a significant role in autoignition chemistry. Alkenes
are easily formed from alkanes under combustion conditions, through H-
atom abstraction reactions or cleavages of β C–H bonds in alkyl radicals.
Given that normal- or iso-alkanes are the major compounds in jet fuels
[23] and diesel fuels [24], the important role of alkenes in dictating the
autoignition  and  flame  properties  of  these  fuels  should  not  be  over-
looked.  Combustion  kinetic  studies  of  hydrocarbon  species  with  C=C
double  bonds  have  been  carried  out  extensively  in  the  literature  for
ethylene [25–44], propene [37,45-52], 1,3-butadiene [53–67], isomers
of  butene  [68–88],  pentene  [13,89-100],  hexene  [10,98,101-111],
heptene [103,112-114], octene [115–117], decene [118,119] and 2,4,
4-trimethyl-1-pentene  [120–124].  However,  comprehensive  kinetic
modeling studies of the oxidation of alkenes containing more than four
carbon  atoms  are  quite  limited  in  the  literature.  The  importance  of
allylic C–C and C–H bonds and allylic radicals, in general, is not suffi-
ciently  well  understood  and  the  practical  implications  are  sometimes
misinterpreted,  with  thorough  understanding  of  important  kinetic
pathways still evolving.

Concerning soot formation processes, which begin with a growth of
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), alkenes are believed to play a
dual role. First, their pyrolysis supplies resonantly stabilized free radi-
cals (RSFR), in large, by cleaving the weakest allylic bonds, and small
stable molecules like acetylene which then react to form PAHs. Second,
they  can  directly  participate  in  chemical  reactions  producing  PAHs.
Mechanistic details of these processes are still far from being well un-
derstood  and  their  temperature-  and  pressure-dependent  kinetic  data
are largely unknown.

The fossil fuels utilized for the past hundred years are mixtures of
molecular components, defined by a range of physical properties. The

fuels of tomorrow will have more distinct molecular structures, defined
by  the  feedstock  from  which  they  are  drawn  and  the  chemical  and
physical  processes  to  which  they  are  subjected  [125].  Understanding
how  specific  features  of  molecular  structure  affect  the  energy  release
during the combustion of a fuel and formation of pollutants is, therefore,
invaluable in aiding the design of future fuels. Biofuels have long been
recognized  as  viable  alternatives  to  conventional  petroleum-based
transportation  fuels  as  can  be  produced  from  bio-feedstocks  and  are
sustainable/eco-friendly. While there are a variety of potential biofuels,
biodiesel and bioethanol are the major biofuels being considered glob-
ally and are at the forefront of alternative fuel technologies [126,127].
The C=C double bond does not just exist in alkenes but also represents a
very  common  functional  group  in  biodiesel  components.  Therefore,
achieving a comprehensive understanding of the combustion chemistry
of  the  C=C  double  bond  is  helpful  to  understand  the  combustion
chemistry of biodiesel and is also valuable for the future fuel design.

This  article  presents  a  wide-ranging  review  of  the  combustion
chemistry of alkenes and aims to (i) reveal the essential chemistry dif-
ference between alkanes and alkenes, (ii) discuss chemical changes with
the  position  of  the  C=C  double  bond  and  the  increasing  number  of
carbon atoms in the fuel molecule, (iii) describe alkenes’ roles in soot
formation,  (iv)  provide  state-of-the-art  reaction  classes  for  alkenes
oxidation under different temperatures and pressures. Experimental and
theoretical tools for exploring combustion chemistry of fuels are high-
lighted  to  provide  an  understanding  of  the  desired  information  and
observable  quantities.  With  the  stage  thus  set,  the  article  gives  an
extensive  overview  of  fundamental  combustion  experiments  by
considering  studies  of  alkenes  in  shock  tubes,  rapid  compression  ma-
chines, jet-stirred and flow reactors, and laminar flames. The value of
the data from such experiments is critically discussed. Abbreviations are

bustion of C2 to C10 alkenes, with a special emphasis on C2 to C7 iso-
mers.  Note  that  this  review  is  focused  on  linear  and  branched  chain
alkenes, and the chemistry of cyclo-alkenes is not included in the sub-
sequent  sections.  Ignition,  flame  propagation,  qualitative  species
assignment, and full quantitative speciation, depending on the specific
combustion  regime,  are  considered.  The  combustion  kinetics  and
development  of  a  comprehensive  mechanism  relevant to  alkene  com-
bustion is presented. The article closes by presenting a summary of the
distinguishing features of alkene combustion chemistry and an outlook
toward future research in this area.

2. Fundamental combustion experiments of alkenes

2.1. Autoignition studies in shock tubes and rapid compression machines

Ignition delay time (IDT) is a global indicator of the overall reactivity
of a fuel. IDT measurements provide highly valuable data to understand
the reactivity dependence on temperature, pressure, equivalence ratio
and mixture composition. IDT data are also used to compare the reac-
tivity  of  various  molecular  structures.  For  model  development  and
validation, IDTs are usually considered to be the most important vali-
dation target for chemical kinetic models.

Homogeneous ignition delay times are measured in shock tubes and
rapid compression machines. These reactors provide well-defined initial
boundary conditions to allow comparison of measured data with simu-
lations. Supersonic shock waves are used to instantaneously compress
and heat gaseous fuel mixtures in shock tubes. The test times in shock
tube  experiments  are  typically  limited  to  a  few  milliseconds,  and,

therefore, shock tubes are typically used to measure high-temperature
IDTs.  Moreover,  development  of  laser  diagnostic  technique  in  shock
tube measurements in past years has had strong influence in the area of
chemical  kinetics.  Measurements  in  shock  tubes  of  high-temperature
reaction  rate  coefficients  using  species-specific  laser  absorption  tech-
niques can provide accurate answers to questions about chemical pro-
cesses [128]. The capabilities of shock tubes in combustion chemistry
studies as well their limitations were discussed in a detailed review by
Hanson  and  Davidson  [129]. For  example,  the  thickness  of  boundary
layer can be a concern for small diameter shock tubes, and this could
have  significant  influence  on  the  validity  of  one-dimensional  shock
equations in determining test gas conditions. Moreover, the test times in
shock tube experiments are largely dictated by the lengths of the driver
and driven sections, and limited by the time when the reflected shock
wave reaches the interface between driver gas and driven gas or by the
arrival of expansion waves. Rapid compression machines (RCMs), on the
other hand, can provide test times up to a few hundred milliseconds,
and, are thus suited for low-temperature IDT measurements [130]. The
compression  and  heating  in  an  RCM  are  achieved  by  a  fast-moving
piston  which  is  locked  in  place  at  the  end-of-compression  to  achieve
constant  volume
small
volume-to-surface area ratio and longer test times, heat transfer to the
walls  becomes  important  in  RCM  measurements.  The  heat  transfer  is
usually accounted for by measuring pressure decrease in non-reactive
experiments  and  simulating  the  experiments  in  a  variable-volume
reactor.  This  so-called  ‘adiabatic  core’  assumption  works  well  except
for  conditions  where  the  first-stage  ignition  heat  release  significantly
alters the heat transfer characteristics. In a recent comprehensive review
about  RCM  facilities  by  Goldsborough  et  al.  [130],  difficulties  in  the
determination of local thermal conditions were emphasized. The onset
of  autoignition  as  well  as  heat  release  rate  can  be  altered  due  to  the
occurrence  of  inhomogeneities,  mixing  and  turbulence  in  the  RCM
combustion  chamber.  Efforts  and  strategies  to  alleviate  undesirable
non-uniformities in RCM experiments were also discussed therein. Sung
and  Curran  [131]  discussed  the  adverse  effects  of  roll-up  vortices,
induced by the high-speed motion of the piston during the compression
stroke,  on  the  interpretation  of  RCM  data.  The  appearance  of  roll-up
vortices  results in undesirable mixing of cold gas forming the bound-
ary layer with hot gases in the core region and leads to inhomogeneity of
the temperature field, causing difficulties in accurately characterizing
the thermodynamic state of the reacting mixture. Efforts to understand
the complex fluid mechanics and alleviate unwanted inhomogeneity in
RCM experiments were introduced in their review.

Ignition delay times of a variety of alkenes have been measured in
shock tube and RCM experiments. These experimental data have been
used to develop and validate chemical kinetic models of alkenes. Liter-
ature work on alkene IDT measurements is summarized in Table 1 and
discussed here briefly.

2.1.1. Ethylene

Ethylene  has  been  the  subject  of  a  number  of  ignition  delay  time
experimental campaigns. One of the first IDT measurements for ethylene
in the shock tube was conducted by Baker et al. in 1972 [132]. They
measured IDTs for lean to rich mixtures of ethylene/O2/Ar at pressures
of  3 and  12 atm and temperatures of  1058–1747 K. They  fitted their
measured  data  to  an  Arrhenius-like  correlation  and  discussed  the
importance  of  oxygen  in  the  chain-branching  reaction.  Interestingly,
they described ethylene ignition process as ‘...in the first part of the in-
duction period pyrolysis dominates, while in the second part oxidation takes
over’.  This  is  the  assertion  which  is  used  in  the  recently  published
HyChem model for jet fuels [133] and is valid for the high temperature
autoignition and flame chemistry of large hydrocarbon fuels.

A couple of years later (1974), Hidaka et al. [134] reported IDTs of
highly  diluted  mixtures  of  ethylene/O2/Ar  in  a  shock  tube.  They
measured  emission  from  CH*,  C2*  and  OH*,  while  describing  the  re-
actions responsible for these emission signals. They reported their IDT

because they are rather abundant. Instead, the more reliable and recent pyrolysis

results based on CH* signal as it provided the highest intensity in their
experiments. About a quarter of century later (1999), the same authors
[135]  studied  ethylene  pyrolysis  and  oxidation  with  a  range  of  new
diagnostics, including IR-laser absorption near 3.39 μm and 4.24 μm, IR
emission near 3.48 μm and gas chromatograph (GC). Using these new
measurements, they proposed a reaction mechanism consisting of 161
reactions and 51 species, which performed well in predicting ethylene
pyrolysis and IDT data. They observed that the predictions for the py-
rolysis and oxidation data were very much dependent on the production
and consumption of the vinyl radical.

C.-W. Zhou et al.

Brown et al. [136] studied ethylene ignition in air-like mixtures in
contrast  to  previous  works  which  employed  high  dilution.  They  dis-
cussed the importance of studying non-diluted conditions which repre-
sent practical combustors better. They found that changing the diluent
from argon to nitrogen can lead to significant changes in IDTs due to
temperature effects.

Colket  et  al.  [16]  carried  out  shock  tube  experiments  to  compare
IDTs  of  various  candidate  fuels  for  scramjet  propulsion.  The  relative
IDTs for the different fuels were found to be in the order: methane >
JP-10 ≈ heptane > ethylene > hydrogen. They discussed the importance
of fuel cracking and showed that fuel cracking enhances ignition. Cad-
man  et  al.  [137]  used  schlieren  imaging  and  chemiluminescence  to
study ethylene ignition over a wide range of temperatures (800 – 1600
K). They divided the ignition process in mild combustion, strong com-
bustion and detonation as a function of increasing temperature behind
reflected shock waves. Kalitan et al. [138] studied the influence of silane
(SiH4) on the IDTs of ethylene. They reported that by adding a small
amount  of SiH4  (< 10%),  the IDTs  reduced as  much as  50% in  some
cases. They compared their measurements with various models and the
IDTs agreed better with the Wang and Laskin [139] model.

Penyazkov et al. [34] measured IDTs of ethylene/air at high pres-
sures (5.9  –  16.5 atm) in  a shock  tube. They observed an increase of
apparent activation energy of the system while going from high to low
temperatures (see Fig. 1) and attributed this behavior to the underlying
reaction  kinetics.  Saxena  et  al.  [33]  extended  previous  IDT  works  by
focusing on high pressures and rich conditions (φ = 3) and also studied
the effect of diluent concentration. They observed strong dependence of
IDTs  on  pressure  for  more  dilute  conditions.  They  provided  a  global
correlation  (see  Fig.  2)  which  represented  their  measurements  and
previous data quite well over 1000 – 2300 K and 0.2 – 20 atm. Kopp et al.
[32] focused on pressure dependence of ethylene/air IDTs by perform-
ing  measurements  over  pressures  of  1.1  –  24.9  atm  and  equivalence
ratios  of  0.3  –  2.  They  observed  that  fuel-lean  mixtures  exhibited
negligible  pressure  dependence,  while  the  usual  trend  of  decreasing
IDTs with increasing pressure was seen for stoichiometric and fuel-rich
mixtures.

Shao et al. [140] measured the IDTs of ethylene/O2/argon mixtures
at high pressures (14 – 60 atm) and high temperatures (950 – 1800 K).
They were able to provide an Arrhenius-like correlation by combining
their measurements with previous data (see Fig. 3). They compared IDT
results with two chemical kinetic models and found AramcoMech [25]
to predict the measured data quite well.

The  only  available  investigation  of  ethylene  ignition  in  a  rapid
compression machine (RCM) was carried out by Kumar et al. [43] over
850 – 1050 K and 15 – 50 bar. Their low-pressure (15 bar) data exhibited
some  curvature  compared  to  the  high-pressure  data.  They  described
 ̇
vinyl + O2  and ethylene + H
O2  reactions to be important for ethylene

autoignition over the range of their experimental conditions.

2.1.2. Propene/allene

Burcat and Radhakrishnan [141] carried out the first measurements
of IDTs of propene/O2/Ar in a shock tube at the temperature range of
1274 – 1840 K and varying concentrations of propene and oxygen. They
discussed  the  importance  of  key  reactions  for  propene  ignition,
including Ḣ + O2 chain branching reaction and H-abstraction from C3H6
by Ḣ atoms. They proposed a kinetic model consisting of 59 reactions
which was adequate, but not complete, to predict measured IDTs. They
were able to correlate their measured IDTs with an Arrhenius expres-
sion. Qin et al. [142] measured IDTs of propene in a shock tube covering
similar  experimental  conditions  as  Burcat  and  Radhakrishnan  [141].
They  reported  that  the  ignition  delays  measured  by  Burcat  and  Rad-
hakrishnan [141] are too long in comparison to their data. They were
able to satisfactorily predict their measured IDTs with their proposed
chemical kinetic mechanism.

Burke et al. [51] carried out a very large and extensive campaign
with  a  multi-university  effort  to  study  the  ignition  of  propene.  They
measured IDTs in shock tubes and RCM covering a wide temperature
range of 750 –  1750 K, three pressures (2, 10, and 40 atm) and three
equivalence ratios (0.5, 1 and 2). Fig. 4 shows the range of conditions

times.  Recently,  Zhou  et  al.  [88]  performed  an  extensive
multi-university study to provide IDTs of isobutene in four shock tubes
and two rapid compression machines in the temperature range of 666 –
1650 K, pressures of 1.7 – 50 atm and equivalence ratios of 0.3 – 2. They
compared their measured IDTs with their newly developed detailed ki-
netic model which performed nicely (see Fig. 5). They described that
 ̇
OH radicals inhibits overall reactivity
H-abstraction from isobutene by
 ̇
OH radicals to produce
because this reaction consumes highly reactive
unreactive 2-methyallyl radicals.

Heyberger et al. [145] measured the IDTs of lean-to-rich mixtures of
1-butene/O2/Ar behind reflected shock waves over 1200 – 1670 K and
6.6  –  8.9  atm.  Predictions  by  their  proposed  model  agreed  well  with
their measured data. They asserted that resonantly stabilized radicals
play a lesser role in 1-butene chemistry in comparison to propene. Pan
et al. [82] extended the pressure range of 1-butene ignition measure-
ments by carrying out their work at 1.2, 4 and 16 atm. They compared
their measurements with the prediction of different models and found
AramcoMech [25] to show better agreement. In comparison to n-butane,
they found that 1-butene exhibits longer IDTs at high temperatures but
shorter IDTs at lower temperatures. They also observed that 1-butene
reactivity lies between that of ethylene and propene at high tempera-
tures (see Fig. 6).

Recently,  Li  et  al.  [86,87]  performed  wide-ranging  studies  on  the

studied  in  their  work  in  contrast  to  previous  literature.  Although  the
experiments were carried out in six different shock tubes and two rapid
compression machines, there is a good agreement among the measure-
ments from various facilities at overlapping conditions. They noticed no
evidence of NTC behavior over their studied conditions. They proposed
a new detailed kinetic model for propene ignition which predicted the
measurements very well.

Allene (propadiene, C3H4) is the simplest diolefin. Curran et al. [143]
measured IDTs allene/O2/Ar behind reflected shock wave at tempera-
ture range of 1200 – 1900 K, pressures of 2 – 5 bar and equivalence ratios
of  0.5  –  2.  They  showed  that  allene  IDTs  can  be  correlated  using  an
Arrhenius  expression.  Their  proposed  model  did  a  reasonable  job  of
capturing  the  measured  data.  They  also  found  that  high-temperature
allene ignition is quite similar to its alkyne isomer (propyne). Fournet
et al. [144] measured ignition delays of allene/O2/Ar in a shock tube at
temperatures  of  1190  –  1742  K  and  pressured  of  8.5  –  10  atm.  They
developed  a  model  to  predict  the  reactivity  of  small  unsaturated  hy-
drocarbons, including acetylene, propyne, allene, and butadiene.

2.1.3. Butenes

The first ignition study of a butene isomer was carried out by Curran
et al. [74] to measure shock tube IDTs of isobutene/O2/Ar over 1100 –
1900 K, pressures of 2.2 –  4.6 atm, and equivalence ratios of 0.1 –  4.
Their computed results agreed quite well with measured ignition delay

ignition  of  1-butene  and  trans-2-butene  in  shock  tubes  and  RCMs,
covering conditions of relevance to practical combustors. They observed
that  2-butene  is  less  reactive  than  1-butene  but  more  reactive  than
isobutene.

2.1.4. Pentenes

Ribaucour et al. [90] and Minetti et al. [89] measured IDTs of stoi-
chiometric mixtures of 1-pentene and n-pentane in a rapid compression
machine at temperatures of 600 – 900 K and pressured of 6 – 9 bar. They
observed  a  clear  NTC  behavior  under  their  studied  conditions  and
described  the  cool  flame  behavior.  They  ascribed  the  formation  of  1,
3-pentadiene  to  be largely  responsible  for  the  NTC  region.  They  con-
trasted the reactivity of 1-pentene with n-pentane, and found 1-pentene
to be less reactive due to the addition of radicals to the double bond.
Cheng et al. [93] measured the ignition delay times of 1-pentene using a
ST at pressures from 1.2 bar to 10 bar, at equivalence ratios from 0.5 to
2.0 with 0.5% and 1.0% fuel concentrations, in the temperature range of
1040–1880 K. They found 1-pentene to be slightly more reactive than
n-pentane at the high-pressure range of their work (see Fig. 7).

Kukkadapu  et  al.  [97]  added  2-pentene  as  a  gasoline  surrogate
component to study its effect on the surrogate ignition in RCM and found
that even a small amount of 2-pentene (5.3% by molar percentage in the
 ̇
OH radicals (almost 15% of
LLNL surrogate) is effective in scavenging
 ̇
OH)  in  the  very  early  stages  of  the
the  overall  consumption  rate  of
 ̇
 ̇
first-stage ignition. About 7.5% of the
OH
OH radicals are consumed by
addition to the double bond while about 7% abstract H-atoms on the
allylic hydrogen atom.

Touchard et al. [99] provided high-temperature IDT measurements
of 1-pentene behind reflected shock waves at temperatures of 1130 –
1620 K, pressures of 7.3 – 9.5 atm and equivalence ratios of 0.5 – 2. They
developed a detailed model of 1-pentene oxidation which predicted the
measured IDTs quite well. Mehl et al. [10] measured IDTs of 1-pentene
and  2-pentene  behind  reflected  shock  waves  over  990  –  1770  K.  By
combining  their  data  with  previous  low-temperature  measurements,
they developed a model based on C1–C4 mechanism of Curran and co-
workers  [146,147].  The  model  performed  very  well  in  predicting the
reactivity of pentene isomers.

Very  recently,  Dong  et  al.  [100]  conducted  ignition  delay  time
measurements in both a high-pressure shock tube and an RCM for 1- and
2-pentene under engine-relevant conditions, covering a wide range of
temperatures  from  600  to  1300  K,  pressures  of  15  and  30  atm,  and
equivalence ratios of 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 in ‘air’. In addition, carbon mon-
oxide time-histories were measured at high temperature regimes and 10
atm in the shock tube for stoichiometric fuel/’air’  mixtures of 1- and
2-pentene, respectively. It was found in their study that at temperatures
above 900 K, the ignition delay times of 1- and 2-pentene are quite close

regardless  of  pressure  and  equivalence  ratio.  However,  at  lower  tem-
peratures, 1-pentene exhibits NTC  behavior while 2-pentene  does not
and is in general less reactive than 1-pentene.

As  for branched pentene  isomers,  Westbrook et  al. [91] measured
high-temperature  IDTs  for  2-methyl-2-butene  in  a  shock  tube  at  tem-
peratures from 1330 to 1730 K and equivalence ratios of 0.5, 1.0 and
2.0, under approximately 1.7, 11.2 and 31 atm.

2.1.5. Hexenes

Vanhove et al. [102] studied the effect of the position of double bond
on the reactivity of hexene isomers (1-, 2- and 3-hexene) by measuring
their IDTs in a rapid compression machine over 630 – 850 K and 6.8 –
8.5 bar. For 3-hexene, they found the ignition behavior to be dominated
by the properties of the double bond, whereas for 1-hexene, reactivity is
dominated by the properties of the alkenyl chain. Therefore, 1-hexene
behaved similar to alkanes and showed NTC behavior, while 3-hexene
exhibited  negligible  NTC  behavior.  Lastly,  2-hexene  showed  an  inter-
mediate behavior with a weaker NTC than that of 1-hexene. Yahyaoui
et al. [107] measured IDTs of 1–hexene/O2/Ar in a shock tube at high
temperatures (1270 – 1700 K), pressures of 2 – 10 bar and equivalence
ratios  of  0.5  –  1.5.  They  observed  a  strong  decrease  in  the  apparent
activation energy for temperatures less than 1400 K.

Mehl et al. [10] measured IDTs of stoichiometric mixtures of 1-, 2-
and 3-hexene/air behind reflected shock waves at temperatures of 990 –
1460 K and pressured of 8.5 - 12 atm. They also developed a model that
predicted the reactivity of hexene isomers from low to high tempera-
tures (see Fig. 8). They agreed with Vanhove et al. [102] assertion that
1-hexene  has  the  highest  reactivity  at  low  temperatures  followed  by
2-hexene  and  3-hexene.  However,  they  observed  2-hexene  to  be  the
fastest  at  high  temperatures  and  1-hexene  to  be  the  slowest  reacting
isomer  at  T  > 1400  K.  They  attributed  this  reactivity  change  at  high
temperatures to the role of decomposition reactions and HO2 chemistry.
Yang et al. [111,148] performed high-temperature (1020 – 1900 K) IDT
measurements of the three hexene isomers in a shock tube at pressures of
1 – 10 atm and equivalence ratios of 0.5 – 2. By comparing the reactivity
of 1- and 2-hexene, they agreed with the conclusions of Mehl et al. [10]
and observed 1-hexene to have slower reactivity at high temperatures
due  to  the  formation  of  higher  concentration  of  resonantly  stabilized
allyl radicals.

Wagnon et al. [149] provided intermediate-temperature (837 – 1086
K) measurements of IDTs of stoichiometric mixtures of hexene isomers
(1-, 2- and 3-hexene) in a rapid compression facility, and they supple-
mented their IDTs with species sampling data.

2.1.6. Heptenes and higher alkenes

There have been very few studies on the ignition of alkenes larger
than C6. Tanaka et al. [113] studied the ignition of three linear isomers
of heptene in a rapid compression machine at 827 K and 41.6 bar. Their
results showed clearly that the reactivity of these heptene isomers at low
temperature is affected considerably by the position of the double bond.
They observed two-stage ignition for 1- and 2-heptene in RCM, while
only a single stage ignition was shown by 3-heptene. These observations
are thus very similar to those found for hexene isomers by Vanhove et al.
[102]. In a study on biodiesel oxidation, Garner et al. [150] measured
shock tube IDTs of 1-heptene as a representative of the alkyl chain of
2-octenoate.  By  comparing  the  reactivity  with  1,6-heptadiene  and
n-heptane  at  the  high  temperatures  of  their  study,  they  showed  that
n-heptane is most reactive, followed by 1-heptene and 1,6-heptadiene is
the least reactive. This reaffirmed previous observations that increasing
degree of unsaturation results in decreasing reactivity.

Recently, Wu et al. [112] investigated the auto-ignition behavior of
1-heptene and 2-heptene in the low-to-intermediate temperature range
(650–950 K) at 15 and 23 bar using an RCM and compared their reac-
tivity  to  that  of  n-heptane  at  the  same  conditions  (see  Fig.  9).  The
reactivity  comparison  showed  that,  as  expected,  n-heptane  has  the
highest reactivity, and both heptene isomers exhibited NTC behavior.
The results showed that there is a crossing point for the reactivity of 1-
and 2-hepetene. At low temperatures, 1-heptene has shorter IDTs than
2-heptene, while 2-heptene is more reactive at higher temperatures. This
 ̇QOOH isomerization being
variation in reactivity is the result of R
more  likely  for  1-heptene  (longer  alkyl  chain)  at  low  temperatures,
while  the  high-temperature  decomposition  pathways  for  2-heptene
produce more reactive radicals.

O2 to

Tekawade  et  al.  [119]  examined  the  reactivity  trends  of  two  C10
alkenes (1-decene and trans-5-decene) in a shock tube and compared the
measured ignition delay times with n-decane. They found that at low
temperatures, trans-5-decene is the least reactive, followed by 1-decene
and n-decane being the most reactive. At high temperatures, however,
the differences in ignition delay times of the three fuels are much smaller
with trans-5-decene being the most reactive. These reactivity trends and
the exhibited NTC behavior are consistent with previous works on C6
and C7 alkenes.

Ignition delay times of two diisobutylene isomers, 2,4,4-trimethyl-1-
pentene and 2,4,4-trimethyl-2-pentene, have been investigated in two
studies.  Metcalfe  et  al.  [123]  measured  IDTs  of  the  two  isomers  in  a
shock tube at low pressures (1 – 4 atm) and high temperatures (1200 –
1550 K). They found that 2,4,4-trimethyl-2-pentene ignited significantly
faster than 2,4,4-trimethyl-1-pentene and that the IDTs of their blend
were directly dependent on the proportions of each isomer. This trend is
consistent  with  previous  works  on  C6,  C7  and  C10  linear  alkenes
wherein  the  shift  of  the  C=C  double  bond  to  the  central  part  of  the

molecule increases the reactivity at high temperatures. Metcalfe et al.
[123]  developed  a  detailed  chemistry  model  for  both  isomers  which
captured the reactivity successfully. Hu et al. [121] measured IDTs of 2,
4,4-trimethyl-1-pentene at higher pressures (2 – 10 atm) and expanded
the  temperatures to  1740 K. Their  results agreed  with Metcalfe et  al.
[123] data at the overlapping conditions.

2.1.7. 1,3-Butadiene

1,3-Butadiene is the simplest conjugated diolefin and is a key inter-
mediate  species  in  hydrocarbon  oxidation.  Fournet  et  al.  [144]
measured  IDTs  of  1,3-butadiene/O2/Ar  at  conditions  similar  to  their
work on allene but their model did not do a good job in predicting 1,
3-butadiene ignition for high fuel concentration data. Zhou et al. [67]
performed  an  extensive  study  on  1,3-butadiene  by  carrying  out  IDT
measurements  in  five  shock  tubes  and  a  rapid  compression  machine,
widely covering temperatures (645 – 1780 K), pressures of 1 – 40 atm
and equivalence ratios of 0.3 – 2. They developed a detailed chemical
kinetic  model  which  predicted  the  measured  IDTs  very  well  at  high
temperatures but exhibited slower reactivity at low temperatures (see
Fig.  10).  To  improve  the  model  performance,  they  suggested  further
 ̇
studies on the key elementary reactions of the addition of
O2
radicals to the double bonds of 1,3-butadine.

2.2. Laminar burning velocity

Laminar  burning  velocity  is  a  very  important  fuel  property  which
affects combustion in a variety of practical combustions, such as spark-
ignited  internal  combustion  engines.  For  a  combustor  designer,  it  is
critical to know how quickly the flame is going to spread as this controls
the burning rate and heat release. Therefore, laminar burning velocity is
measured  in  idealized  reactors  to  understand  the  differences  among
various fuels and to characterize flame speed variation as a function of
equivalence  ratio,  initial  temperature  and  initial  pressure.  Laminar
burning velocity is a key validation target for the development of high-
temperature chemical kinetic models. The reader is referred to reviews
[151,152]  on advances and challenges  of flame  speed  measurements.
Laminar burning velocities have been measured for a variety of alkenes.
Literature work on flame speed measurements is summarized in Table 1
and discussed here briefly.

2.2.1. Ethylene

The very first measurement of the burning velocity of ethylene was
carried out by Linnett and Hoare [153] in 1948. They determined the
burning velocities by measuring the shape of flame cone in a cylindrical
burner tube. The shape of the cone was measured by throwing a shadow
of the flame on a light-sensitive film. Due to the non-availability of pure
ethylene  gas,  it  was  prepared  by  the  reaction  of  ethyl  alcohol  with
◦
phosphoric acid at 220
C. Fig. 11 shows a shadow photograph of flame
cone recorded by Linnett and Hoare [153] and their burning velocity
measurements as a function of ethylene volume percent. This pioneering
work was followed up by Gerstein et al. [154] who used an improved
flame tube apparatus to measure burning velocities for a larger number
of hydrocarbons, including ethylene. As discussed by Egolfopoulos et al.
[152], these early studies did not adequately account for aerodynamic
stretch effects, which lead to somewhat uncertain determination of the
laminar flame speed.

Egolfopoulos  et  al.  [41]  used  the  counterflow  flame  technique  to
measure laminar flame speeds for C2 hydrocarbons at room temperature
and pressures ranging 0.25 to 3 atm. They also developed a C2 kinetic
mechanism which predicted measured flame speeds adequately.

Various  works  on  ethylene  flame  speed  measurements  have  been
summarized in a recent work by Huo et al. [155]. There is generally a
good agreement among the experimental data and the kinetic models
predict the flame speeds quite well. Hou et al. [155] expanded previous
works by performing measurements at high pressures (up to 10 atm).
They  also  discussed  the  sensitivity  of  flame  speed  to  elementary

reactions comprising the kinetic model. Flame speed is most sensitive to
the chain branching Ḣ + O2 →   ̇
O reaction followed by the key heat
release reaction CO +  ̇
OH → CO2 + Ḣ. At fuel-rich conditions, some C2
related reactions also become important in determining the flame speed.

OH +  ̈

2.2.2. Propene

Davis  and Law  [46]  measured the  laminar  flame speeds  of  prope-
ne/air mixtures at room temperature and atmospheric pressure over an
extensive range of equivalence of 0.7 to 1.7 using the counterflow twin
flame configuration. Burke et al. [51] measured propene flame speeds in
5  different  locations  which  included  either  a  constant  volume  vessel
(spherically expanding flame) or a heat flux burner. These data along
with  previous  measurements  are  shown  in  Fig.  12  for  atmospheric
pressure.  The  scatter  in  the  data  represents  uncertainty  of  the  flame
speed measurements using different methods and facility effects, as well
as inconsistencies in the flame speed extrapolation for spherical flames.
The  newly  developed  model  by  Burke  et  al.  [51]  did  a  good  job  in
predicting the flame speed measurements except at fuel-rich conditions.
The authors suggested that the chemistry model should be extended to
include  heavier  hydrocarbons,  including  aromatics,  to  improve  the
prediction  for  rich  propene  flames.  The  sensitivity  analysis  (Fig.  12)
shows that, in addition to the expected dependence on C0 and C1 re-
actions, the flame speed is affected by the formation and consumption of
 ̇
resonantly stabilized allyl radicals (
C3H5-a). Burke et al. [51] provided
mass burning rate of propene for pressures as high as 20 atm and flame
speed data for the temperature range of 298 – 398 K.

2.2.3. Butenes

Davis and Law [156] used the counterflow twin flame configuration
to measure laminar flame speeds for a wide range of C1 to C8 hydro-
carbons,  including  alkanes,  alkenes,  alkynes,  aromatics  and  alcohols.
They showed that alkenes have generally higher flame speeds than al-
kanes. They also found that flame speeds of 1-alkenes are higher than for
n-butane,  with  propene  and  1-butene  having  similar  values,  while
ethylene  has  the  largest  flame  speed.  The  higher  flame  speeds  of
ethylene are caused by a higher adiabatic flame temperature and faster
oxidation kinetics at these conditions.

Fenard et al. [83,85] measured flame speeds of 1- and 2-butene (cis
and trans isomers) using a spherical combustion vessel. They observed
that trans-2-butene/air mixtures have slightly lower burning velocities
compared to cis-2-butene for rich conditions, though the differences are
only  minor.  They  observed  that  Zhao  et  al.  [79]  measurements  for
1-butene are too low compared to their measurements as well as those

[25]. (b) Flame speed sensitivity at φ = 0.95. (“This study” refers to the work by Burke et al. [51])

by  Davis  and  Law  [156].  Finally,  1-butene  has  higher  flame  speeds
compared to 2-butene over the range of studied conditions (see Fig. 13).
Schenk  et  al.  [78]  utilized  a  low-pressure  flame  coupled  to  a
time-of-flight MBMS and GC to carry out isomer-specific speciation of
more  than  30  stable  molecules  and  radicals  for  three  butene  isomers
(1-butene,  trans-2-butene  and  iso-butene).  They  contrasted  the  oxida-
tion of these three isomers with the help of experimental data as well as
detailed kinetic modeling. For example, they described the pathways to
the formation of propene from butene isomers and showed that propene
formation is largest for 2-butene followed by 1-butene and iso-butene.
On the other hand, the highest mole fraction of benzene is observed in
the  iso-butene  flame  followed  by  that  in  1-  and  2-butene  and  this
behavior is directly correlated with the amounts of propargyl formed in
these flames.

Zhou et al. [88] carried out a large experimental effort to measure
laminar flame speeds of isobutene at three different facilities using the
constant volume vessel and heat flux burner methods. The experiments
were  carried  out  at  atmospheric  pressure  and  initial  temperatures
ranging 298 – 398 K. The detailed model developed by Zhou et al. [88]
underestimated isobutene flame speeds by about 5 cm/sec. Sensitivity
analysis showed that the flame speed is largely sensitive to C0 and C1
 ̇
OH from
chemistry and has only minor dependence on H-abstraction by
isobutene. Davis and Law [156] showed in their work that the isobutene
flame speed is lower than that of 1-butene, since methyl branching leads
to lowering of burning velocities.

Recently, Movaghar et al. [157] conducted extensive laminar flame
speed measurements for a variety of C1–C4 saturated and unsaturated
hydrocarbons  at  high  pressures  from  8  to  30  atm  and  unburned  gas
temperatures ranging from 400 to 520 K, for equivalence ratios of 0.8,
1.0  and  1.3.  Two  butene  isomers,  1-butene  and  isobutene,  as  well  as
ethylene and propene were included as targets in that study.

2.2.4. Pentenes

Laminar flame speeds of three pentene isomers (1-pentene, 2-pen-
tene, 2-methyl-2-butene) were investigated by Cheng et al. [92] over a
range  of  equivalence  ratios,  initial  pressures  of  1  –  4  atm  and  initial
temperatures of 353 – 433 K using a constant volume vessel. The results
(see Fig. 14) show that, similar to C4 alkenes, 1-pentene has the highest
flame  speed,  followed  by  2-pentene  and  the  branched  pentene
(2-methyl-2-butene)  has  the  slowest  flame  speed.  The  laminar  flame
speeds of these fuels are largely affected by their corresponding adia-
batic temperatures and, to a lesser extent, by the oxidation kinetics. As
an example of kinetic effects, 2-methyl-2-butene has lower flame speed
 ̇
because it produces H-consuming intermediates and
CH3  radicals. The
employed  chemical  kinetic  model  did  a  reasonable  job  in  predicting
laminar  flame  speeds  except  for  2-pentene  where  the  model  over-
estimated  the  measured  value  by  about  6  cm/sec  at  stoichiometric
condition. Zhong et al. [94] measured laminar flame speeds of 1-pente-
ne/air in a constant volume combustion vessel at initial pressures of 0.1
MPa and 0.3 MPa, initial temperatures of 350 K and 450 K, and equiv-
alence ratios ranging from 0.5 to 1.6.

simulations.

2.2.5. Hexenes

Since the 1951 laminar flame measurements of Gerstein et al. [154]
on a number of hydrocarbons, including 1-hexene, there has only been
one more recent work on 1-hexene by Fan et al [110]. They measured
laminar  burning  velocity  of  1-hexene/air  mixtures  in  a  cylindrical
combustion vessel at 373 K and a range of pressures (1 – 10 atm). The
measured flame speeds (see Fig. 15) were modeled quite well by their
new  kinetic  model  of  1-hexene  consisting  of  122  species  and  919  re-
actions.  Sensitivity  analysis  indicated  that  flame  speeds  are  largely
dependent on Ḣ + O2 and CO +  ̇
OH reactions with minor influence from
reactions involving allyl radicals.

2.2.6. Heptenes and higher alkenes

Very few studies investigated the laminar burning velocities of al-
kenes larger than C6. Recently, Mei et al. [114] measured flame speeds
of 1-heptene/air in a constant-volume cylindrical vessel at 373 K and a
range of pressures and equivalence ratios. Similar to other alkenes, the
flame speeds peak near φ = 1.1. The authors modified a previous model
to improve the prediction of flame speeds of 1-heptene.

Recently, there have been three works which reported laminar flame
speeds of diisobutylene isomers. Burning velocities of 2,4,4-trimethyl-1-
pentene were measured by Zheng et al. [124] and Hu et al. [120], where
Hu  et  al.  [120]  covered  relatively  wider  ranges  of  temperature  and
pressure. Yin et al. [122] compared the flame speeds of the two isomers
of  diisobutylene,  2,4,4-trimethyl-1-pentene  (JC8H16)  and  2,4,4-trime-
thyl-2-pentene  (IC8H16).  The  results  showed  that  IC8H16  has  higher
flame speed particularly at rich conditions and higher initial tempera-
ture (see Fig. 16). The two isomers have very similar adiabatic flame
temperatures,  and,  therefore,  the  difference  in  their  flame  speeds  is
mainly  attributed  to  the  different  decomposition  routes  taken  by  the
isomers due to the position of the double bond. The modified model by
Yin et al. [122] performed quite well in prediction the experimentally
measured flame speeds.

2.2.7. 1,3-Butadiene

In their pioneering work, Davis and Law [156] compared laminar
flame speed of 1,3-butadiene with C4 alkenes and alkanes. The results
show  that  1,3-butadiene  has  much  higher  flame  speed  compared  to
1-butene, iso-butene, iso-butane, and n-butane. It is seen that the more
unsaturated  the  molecule,  the  higher  the  flame  speed.  As  discussed
before, branching reduces the flame speed and, therefore, iso-butene has
a lower flame speed compared to 1-butene.

In their extensive study on 1,3-butadiene, Zhou et al. [67] measured
laminar flame speeds of 1,3-butadiene in a constant volume vessel over

295 – 399 K and pressures of 1 and 5 atm. Their detailed kinetic model
captured the measured burning velocities quite well over the range of
experimental conditions (see Fig. 17). Sensitivity analysis revealed that,

2.3. Speciation measurements

Ignition delay times and laminar flame speeds are important global
indicators of fuel reactivity and provide valuable targets for the devel-
opment  and  validation  of  chemical  kinetic  models.  However,  these
measurements do not give in-depth information about the underlying
chemistry. Species measurements during fuel oxidation or pyrolysis, on
the other hand, are highly desired in understanding intricacies of the
chemical  systems  by  measuring  quantities  such  as  fuel  consumption
rate,  radical  pool,  production  and  consumption  of  intermediates  and
product formation. Such data also place much more stringent targets on
the fidelity of chemical models.

Jet-stirred reactors (JSR), low-pressure flames and flow reactors may
be coupled to GC-MS, FTIR or TOF-MS to measure intermediate species
and products of fuel pyrolysis/oxidation. Recently, a number of groups
have utilized synchrotron-based vacuum ultraviolet photon ionization
mass  spectrometry  (SVUV-PIMS)  to  provide  extensive  speciation  data
which have helped tremendously in increasing our understanding of fuel
chemistry and improving the fidelity of kinetic models. Literature work
on  alkene  speciation  is  summarized  in  Table  1  and  discussed  here
briefly.

2.3.1. Ethylene

A  large  number  of  speciation  studies  have  been  carried  out  for
ethylene oxidation due to it being, perhaps, the most important inter-
mediate of the oxidation of large hydrocarbons. In 1963, Homann et al.
[158] measured 15 species in a low-pressure (34 Torr) fuel-rich ethylene
flame using molecular-beam mass spectrometry (MBMS). This was fol-
lowed  up  by  works  from  Peeters  and  Mahnen  [159],  Peeters  and
Vinckier [160], Harriss et al. [161], Cool et al. [162], Marinov and Malte
[163], Wilk et al. [164] and Westbrook et al.[165]. Here, we particularly
mention highly detailed and pioneering works of Bhargava and West-
moreland carried out on fuel-lean (φ = 0.75) [166] and fuel-rich (φ =
1.90) [44] ethylene flames in a low-pressure flat-flame burner coupled
to  MBMS.  The  authors  took  special  care  in  measuring  temperature
profiles  and  area  expansion  ratio,  and  they  achieved  very  good
elemental  flux  balances.  They  measured  concentration  profiles  of  22
stable and radical species for the lean flame and 42 species for the rich
flame.  These  measurements  helped  in  mapping  the  ethylene  flame
structure and provided valuable data to build and refine ethylene kinetic

mechanism. In the rich flame, they reported profiles of a number of C6
species including benzene. The authors also derived rate constants for
 ̇
H-abstraction reactions from ethylene by Ḣ and
OH radicals. Profiles of
some  stable  species  are  compared  in  Fig.  18  for  the  fuel-lean  and
fuel-rich flames. As expected, rich flame results in unburnt CO and H2
with a more extended reaction zone.

In addition to flame experiments, ethylene oxidation has also been
studied extensively in jet-stirred reactors (JSR). Dagaut et al. [167] used
their  4-nozzle  turbulent  jet  design  of  the  fused  silica  JSR  to  study
ethylene oxidation over 900 – 1200 K, 1 – 10 atm and equivalence ratios
of 0.15 – 4. The gaseous samples were analyzed using a multicolumn,
multidetector  gas  chromatograph.  They  assembled  a  reaction  mecha-
nism consisting of 277 reactions and 48 species to model the measured
concentration  profiles.  The  simulated  profiles  did  a  reasonable  job  in
predicting major species formed during ethylene oxidation. Westbrook
et al. [168] used a different design of JSR to examine fuel-lean ethyl-
ene/air oxidation at atmospheric pressure and used the measurements to
optimize their developed kinetic model. In other JSR speciation works,
Jallais et al. [36] studied highly rich ethylene oxidation, while Le Chong
et al. [37] investigated the effect of large amounts of CO2  and H2O on
ethylene oxidation kinetics.

Flow  reactors  coupled  to  GC  and/or  FTIR  have  also  been  used  to
investigate ethylene oxidation. Carriere et al. [38] studied fuel-rich (φ =
2.5) ethylene oxidation using a variable-pressure turbulent flow reactor
over 850 – 950 K and 5 – 10 atm. They combined their data with those of

Bhargava and Westmoreland [44] to test various kinetic mechanisms.
They concluded that improved multi-channel calculations of the com-

recently,  Lopez  et  al.  [39]  extended  ethylene  oxidation  work  to  very
high  pressures  (60  bar)  in  a  plug-flow  laminar  flow  reactor.  They

2.3.2. Propene/allene

The  first  detailed  study  of  speciation  in  propene  (C3H6)  oxidation
was carried out by Dagaut et al. [45] in a jet-stirred reactor over 900 –
1200 K, 1 –  8 atm and φ  = 0.15 –  4. In addition to the reactant and
product profiles, they also measured intermediate compounds, such as
ethylene, ethane, acetaldehyde and ethane. Their newly assembled ki-
netic mechanism, consisting of 277 reactions and 48 species, performed
reasonably  well  in  predicting  the  measured  concentration  profiles
except for some overprediction of acetaldehyde and ethane. In later JSR
investigations, Dagaut et al. [169] and Le Chong et al. [37] studied the
reduction  of  NO  by  propene  and  the  effect  of  CO2/H2O  on  propene
oxidation, respectively.

Davis and Law [46] studied propene pyrolysis and oxidation in a flow

reactor at 1 atm, 1200 K and three equivalence ratios (φ = 0.7, 1, 1.4).
They  measured  intermediate  compounds  and  species  as  large  as  ben-
zene. Their detailed kinetic model consisting of 71 species and 469 re-
actions  did  a  good  job  in  predicting  measured  profiles  with  some
deficiencies in acetylene, 1-butene and benzene prediction (see Fig. 19).
Recently, Burke et al. [52] put together an extensive multi-university
effort  to  study  propene  oxidation  using  JSR  and  flow  reactors.  They
measured species profiles in JSR experiments targeted at lower dilution
levels  and  lower  temperatures  (800  –  1100  K)  compared  to  previous
works,  and  they  measured  large  species  such  as  1,5-hexadiene  and
benzene. Using two high-pressure flow reactors, they extended propene
oxidation  studies  to  higher  pressures  (6  –  15  atm).  The  authors  used
species measurements to optimize/validate rate coefficients of key re-
actions in the propene system. For example, Fig. 20 shows the effect of
 ̇
the allyl + H
O2 reaction rate constant on the species profiles measured
in the JSR experiments. The authors proposed a comprehensive model
which performed extremely well in modeling a large variety of previous
and current propene oxidation experiments.

A  number  of  studies  investigated  the  reactivity  and  kinetic  differ-
ences of the two isomers of C3H4, namely allene and propyne. Here, we
restrict our focus to allene. Pauwels et al. [170] added 1% allene to a
low-pressure  H2-O2-Ar  flame  to  understand  the  changes  in  flame
behavior and species formation due to the presence of allene. In addition
to  sampling-based  mass  spectrometric  measurements,  they  used
 ̇
laser-induced fluorescence to measure temperature and
OH concentra-
tion. They observed significant amounts of methane and acetylene as a
consequence  of  the  recombination  of  propargyl  which  is  formed  by
H-abstraction from allene by H radicals. Curran et al. [143] and Faravelli

et al. [171] carried out JSR oxidation of allene over similar conditions
and developed detailed kinetic models to describe the reactivity differ-
ences  with  propyne.  Recently,  Hansen  et  al.  [172]  performed
isomer-specific  speciation  study  in  a  low-pressure  flame  of  allene  by
analyzing the sampled gases with SVUV-MBMS. By varying photon en-
ergy, they were able to separate species  with the same mass, such as
benzene and fulvene (m/z = 78), 1-butene and 2-butene (m/z = 56), 1,
3-butadiene and 1-butyne (m/z = 54). Their detailed model predicted
the formation of radicals and aromatics quite well (see Fig. 21).

2.3.3. Butenes

The first JSR speciation work on 1-butene was carried out in 1989 by
Chakir et al. [84] over 900 – 1200 K, 1 – 10 atm and equivalence ratios of
0.15  –  4.  The  key  intermediate  species  detected  during  1-butene
oxidation were ethylene, propene, methane, 1,3-butadiene and ethane.
Some  unsaturated  compounds  were  also  detected,  including  cis-  and
trans-2-butene. New reactions were added to the previously developed
model of ethylene, propene and propane to model the species formed
from 1-butene. In two recent works, Fenard et al. [83,85] studied the
oxidation of 1-butene, cis- and trans-2-butene in a JSR at atmospheric
pressure and a range of equivalence ratios. Their newly developed ki-
netic model, consisting of 201 species and 1787 reactions, performed
quite well in predicting their measured species profiles and literature
work of Schenk et al. [78] in a low-pressure flame (Fig. 23). Sensitivity
and  reaction  pathway  analyses  showed  the  importance  of  resonantly
stabilized radicals such as propenyl and butenyl in the butene oxidation
system. Fig. 22 shows various species measured by Fenard et al. [83] for
the oxidation of cis-2-butene in a JSR at fuel-rich conditions. The plots
show the formation of trans-2-butene and relatively large amounts of 1,
3-butadiene.

The JSR oxidation of iso-butene was studied by Dagaut and Cath-
onnet  [76],  where  they  described  the  formation  of  major  and  minor
species from iso-butene with the help of their speciation data and kinetic
model. Previous to this, iso-butene ignition was also studied in a flow
reactor by Brezinsky and Dryer [75] at atmospheric pressure. These two
works were included in the validation of the recently developed detailed
kinetic model of iso-butene by Zhou et al [88].

Recently, Zhang et al. [173] studied the low-temperature oxidation
of 1-butene and iso-butene in a JSR at 790 Torr and equivalence ratio of
0.35.  With  dimethyl  ether  (DME)  doped  into  the  fuel/Ar  mixtures,
oxidation of the fuels was triggered at temperatures from 500 to 725 K.
The SVUV-PIMS technique was employed to quantify the concentration
evolutions of the oxidation intermediates.

2.3.4. Pentenes

The oxidation of 1-pentene was studied by Prabhu et al. [95] in a
pressurized flow reactor at 6 atm and 600 – 800 K. They observed that
1-pentene exhibited  alkane type behavior  with low-temperature reac-
tivity and strong NTC behavior. Their species measurements indicated
that H-abstraction reactions leading to allyl radicals are more important
than radical addition to the double bond, which is in contrast to smaller
alkenes  where  addition  reactions  play  a  larger  role.  The  authors  also
studied  the  influence  of  adding  small  amounts  of  nitric  oxide  to  the
oxidation behavior of 1-pentene. In another work on 1-pentene, Alatorre
et al. [96] carried out speciation measurements in a fuel-rich (C/O ratio
of  0.773)  low-pressure  (50  mbar)  flame.  At  the  high-temperatures  of
their work, they observed that 1-pentene behaves quite similar to pro-
pene due to the fact that 1-pentene decomposes mainly to propene and
ethylene.  They  developed  a  detailed  model  for  1-pentene  which  pre-
dicted measured species profiles reasonably well. The pyrolysis of 1-pen-
tene under 0.04 and 1 atm at temperatures in the range of 900–1300 K
was  investigated  by  Cao  et  al.  [174]  in  a  flow  reactor  coupled  with
SVUV-PIMS. In a recent work of Dong et al. [100], the species versus
temperature profiles of the oxidations of 1- and 2-pentene at φ = 1.0, 1
atm and temperatures in the range of 700–1000 K were measured in a
JSR. Westbrook et al. [91] recently studied a branched pentene isomer,
2-methyl-2-butene in a JSR near atmospheric pressure and low to high
temperatures  (600  –  1100  K).  In  addition  to  the  major  species,  they
measured large amounts of isoprene, acetylene, propene, iso-butene and
a  few  oxygenated  intermediates  including  C5  cyclic  ethers.  Based  on
their observations, they developed a detailed kinetic model to describe
the oxidation of pentene isomers from low to high temperatures.

2.3.5. Hexenes

There  have  been  three  detailed  JSR  speciation  studies  on  hexene
isomers. The first one was carried out by Yahyaoui et al. [105] on 1-hex-
ene  over  750  –  1200  K  and  10  atm.  Measured  species  profiles  were
modeled using their newly developed model, consisting of 177 species
and  1171  reactions,  for  1-hexene  oxidation.  Among  the  intermediate
compounds,  large  fractions  of  ethylene,  methane  and  propene  were
detected,  whereas  considerable  amounts  of  1-butene,  1,3-butadiene,
acetylene and benzene were also measured. Battin-Leclerc carried out a
detailed speciation study of the three hexene isomers (1-, 2- and 3-hex-
ene) at atmospheric pressure and extended to lower temperatures down
to 500 K. In addition to GC measurements, 1-hexene was also studied

with tunable synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization coupled
to a TOF-MS. Comparison of the reactivity of these isomers is shown in
Fig. 24. As observed by Vanhove et al. [102] in their RCM ignition study,
JSR  data  also  show that 1-hexene is  most  reactive  in  the NTC  region
followed  closely  by  2-hexene,  whereas  3-hexene  does  not  exhibit
noticeable NTC behavior. At higher temperatures (700 – 850 K), 1-hex-
ene is less reactive compared to the other two isomers. At further high
temperatures, 1-hexene oxidation results in relatively larger formation
of  unsaturated  compounds  (ethylene,  propene)  and  aromatics  (ben-
zene). More recently, Meng et al. [109] revisited 1-hexene oxidation in a
JSR over wider range of equivalence ratios (φ = 0.5 – 2). In addition to
the usual GC sampling, they also used single photon ionization TOF-MS
and a cw-cavity-ringdown spectrometer to measure additional species.
They  updated  their  previously  developed  model  to  provide  improved
prediction of ignition and species profiles.

Hansen  et  al.  [175]  investigated  fuel-rich  (φ  = 2)  1-hexene
low-pressure  (40  mbar)  flat  flame  by  analyzing  sampled  gases  with
the  help  of  synchrotron-generated  VUV  radiation  and  TOF-MS.  They
measured a large number of isomer-resolved intermediate compounds
and products with special emphasis on benzene and aromatic formation.
They observed that benzene is dominantly formed in the 1-hexene flame
via H-assisted isomerization of fulvene, whereas propargyl recombina-
tion is a minor channel for benzene formation. Fulvene is formed in this
flame  primarily  from  the  reaction  of  allyl  and  propargyl  radicals,
because large amounts of allyl radicals are formed via the unimolecular
dissociation of 1-hexene.

In addition to the laminar flame speeds of 1-hexene, Fan et al. [110]
also studied the pyrolysis of 1-hexene at 0.04, 0.2 and 1 atm over tem-
peratures from 800 to 1350 K in a flow reactor. SVUV-PIMS and GC-MS
were both used to characterize the species concentration profiles as a
function of temperature.

2.3.6. Higher alkenes

There  are  only  a  handful  of  studies  which  carried  out  speciation
measurements for alkenes larger than C6. Cao et al. [176] investigated
the  low-temperature  oxidation  of  1-heptene  in  a  jet-stirred  reactor  at
temperatures of 450–800 K, 770 Torr and equivalence ratios of 0.5–2.0.
The SVUV-PIMS in combination with GC-MS were utilized to identify
the intermediate species and quantify their concentrations. Meng et al.
[117]  studied  the  oxidation  of  1-octene  in  a  jet-stirred  reactor  at  at-
mospheric  pressure  and  a  range  of  temperatures  (500  –  1100  K)  and
equivalence ratios (φ = 0.25 – 2). A number of oxidation products, such
as  1,4-pentadiene,  cyclohexene,  ethylcyclohexene,  aldehydes,  2-octa-
none  and  octenal  were  measured  and  quantified.  A  clear  NTC
behavior was also observed for 1-octene, with the extent of NTC being
largest for the fuel-lean conditions (see Fig. 25). The authors developed a
detailed model which captured the intermediate and high temperature
chemistry  quite  well  but  underpredicted  the  NTC  activity.  They  also
compared  their  model  predictions  with  previous  speciation  measure-
ments of 1-octene oxidation by Piperel et al. [177] and Fridlyand et al.
[178].

namely

1-decene,

In  order  to  study  the  influence  of  double  bond  position  on  the
oxidation of C10 isomers, Fridlyand et al. [118] studied four isomers of
and
decene,
trans-5-decene, in a single pulse shock tube at high pressures (40 – 66
bar) and relatively high temperatures (> 850 K). Using GC sampling,
they measured few stable intermediates, including ethylene, acetylene,
ethane,  methane,  1-butene,  propene,  1,3-butadiene  and  benzene.  The
results showed that as the double bond position moved to the center of
the fuel molecule, the reactivity increased. This is consistent with pre-
vious  high-temperature  oxidation  works  on  C6  –  C8  alkenes.  No
appreciable difference was observed between the reactivity of cis and
trans isomers of 5-decene.

2.3.7. 1,3-Butadiene

Most of the studies on 1,3-butadiene have focused on the formation
of aromatic species during the oxidation of this diolefin. Cole et al. [61]
measured  mole  fraction  profiles  of  37  species  in  a  rich  (φ  = 2.4)
low-pressure  (20  Torr)  1,3-butadiene  flat-flame.  The  detected  species

included products, small intermediates and aromatics such as benzene,
toluene,  phenylacetylene  and  styrene.  They  hypothesized  that  the
addition of 1,3-butadienyl radicals to acetylenic species forms aromatic
compounds  in  their  studied  flame.  More  recently,  Hansen  et  al.  [64]
studied  benzene  formation  from  a  similar  low-pressure  1,3-butadiene

flame  at relatively less fuel-rich conditions (φ  = 1.8). This  new work
concluded that benzene is primarily formed via roughly equal contri-
 ̇
C4H5  + C2H2  reactions.  The  kinetic
butions  from
model proposed by Hansen et al. [64] performed very well to predict
intermediate compounds and aromatics measured in their work as well
as by Cole et al. [61]. A detailed JSR speciation study of 1,3-butadiene at
high pressures (1 – 10 atm) was carried out by Dagaut and Cathonnet
[179]. They measured a number of species and discussed the variation in
the  importance  of  benzene  formation  pathways  as  a  function  of  tem-
perature and pressure.

3. Chemical kinetics of alkene combustion

3.1. The molecular structure of alkenes

Before  considering  important  reaction  classes  and  comprehensive
chemical kinetic models for alkenes oxidation, we should first look at the
structural features of alkenes that distinguish them from other fuels and
how  those  features  in  turn  affect  their  kinetic  behavior  during  com-
bustion. Alkenes contain a C=C double bond which results in different
thermochemical and reaction kinetic properties as compared to alkanes.
The  following  effects  need  to  be  paid  special  attention  to  when  we
discuss the kinetics of alkenes oxidation. First, addition reactions to the
double bond with different radicals and atoms at different temperatures
are crucial in determining the reactivity of alkenes. Second, the presence
of weak allylic C–H or C–C bonds makes the formation of allylic radicals
in alkenes dominant through the entire temperature range and hence
their chemistry needs to be carefully considered. Third, the number and
type  of  allylic  radicals  changes  along  with  the  position  of  the  C=C
double  bond,  therefore,  the  subsequent  chemistry  needs  to  be  distin-
guished.  These  unique  features  provide  interesting  discussion  points
with regard to the combustion chemistry of alkenes.

The molecular structures of alkenes are routinely determined at the
chemically-accurate G4 [182] and CBS-QB3 [183] levels of electronic
structure  theory  using  Gaussian  09  [184]  to  identify  the  most  stable
conformers and then to calculate bond dissociation energies (BDEs). The
G4 [182] and CBS-QB3 [183] composite methods are computationally
less  expensive  but  still  able  to  predict  0  K  formation  enthalpies  in
reasonable  accuracy  [185–188],  hence  they  were  employed  in  the
extensive  BDE  calculations  for  the  C–H  and  C–C  bonds  in  a  series  of
C2–C8  alkenes  as  shown  in  Fig.  29.  Taking  the  comparison  between
n-pentane and 1-pentene, shown in Fig. 26 as an example, it can be seen
that the bond dissociation energy for the secondary allylic C–H bond is
(cid:0) 1  lower than that for the normal secondary C–H
about 13.0 kcal mol
bond,  which  makes  the  formation  of  allylic  radicals  in  1-pentene
oxidation  very  competitive.  Moreover,  the  subsequent  chemistry  for
the  formed  allylic  radical  in  1-pentene  oxidation  and  alkyl  radical  in
n-pentane is also quite different. It is well known that in alkane oxida-
tion, the first and second molecular oxygen addition to the alkyl radicals
and  related  isomerization  reactions  are  the  main  chain  branching

reaction pathways providing the low temperature radical pools, whilst
this is not the same for alkenes. As shown in Fig. 26, the stabilization
(cid:0) 1 at the
energy for the formed C–OO bond in n-pentane is 36.1 kcal mol
 ̇
G4 level, which makes the R
O2 radical strong enough to proceed to the
subsequent  isomerization  and  second  O2  addition  reactions.  Alterna-
(cid:0) 1, not strong enough
tively, the bond for 1-pentene is only 20.4 kcal mol
to undergo the subsequent low temperature chemistry as in alkanes, and
the RA

O2 radical is likely to dissociate back to ṘA + O2.

structure in the transition state locks the rotation of three hindered ro-
tors, hence decreasing the entropy of the reaction process which ulti-
mately decreases the rate constant of this reaction channel. Taking these
 ̇
two effects into consideration, the formed RA
O2 intermediate in alkene
oxidation would more likely dissociate back to the allylic radical + O2
rather than take the isomerization pathways of alkanes. Therefore, the
reactions of ṘA  radicals with molecular oxygen are not found to be of
particular  importance  in  determining the  fuel  reactivity.  However,  as

pathways known for alkanes. This is one of the major differences be-
tween alkanes and alkenes originating from the effect of the C=C double
bond functional group.

Hydrogen types in alkenes are defined in Fig. 28 which takes 1-hex-
ene as an example. Extensive calculations for the bond dissociation en-
ergies of the C–H and C–C bonds in alkenes, including C2 to C8 species
discussed in the subsequent sections, have been carried out at both G4
and CBS-QB3 levels of theory and the results are shown in Fig. 29. The
results calculated here are in reasonable agreement with the available
measured values collected by Luo [189], with BDEs for the C–H bonds all
within  ~2.0  kcal/mol,  and  BDEs  for  the  C–C  bonds  all  within  ~2.5
kcal/mol except for a very few cases up to 3.0 kcal/mol. The allylic C–C
bonds always hold the lowest BDE of ~72.0 kcal/mol, and consistently
weaker than the alkylic C–C bonds by ~13.0 kcal/mol and the vinylic
C–C bonds by ~23.5 kcal/mol. This indicates that among the C–C bonds
in  alkenes,  the  allylic  ones  have  the  highest  tendency  to  be  broken
during the high temperature pyrolysis regimes. Secondary vinylic C–H

The presence of the functional group with a C=C double bond influences
only BDE of the allylic C–C and C–H bonds. The C–H bonds next to the
allylic carbon in the opposite position from the C=C double have BDE
typical for alkylic hydrogen. It also needs to be highlighted that the BDEs
of the two types of vinylic C–H bonds in 1,3-butadiene are all very high
such that hydrogen atom abstraction reactions are less likely to occur as
compared to alkenes with allylic hydrogen atoms. Therefore, addition
reactions of different radicals and atoms onto the C=C double bond in 1,
3-butadiene are more favored. This is also one of the main differences
between mono-alkenes and dienes which do not have allylic hydrogen
atom.

Furthermore, the presence of C=C double bond in alkenes can have
several other interesting effects. In the allylic alkenyl radicals, ṘA, pro-
duced from H-atom abstraction reactions, the radical site is delocalized
among the two carbon atoms adjacent to the β carbon atom which leads
to  a  multiplication  of  products  in  subsequent  radical  recombination
reactions. For example, in the oxidation of 1- and 2-butene [86,87], the

ered,  as a  result of the  mesomerism of
higher alkenes (≥ C5), it is possible that fuel molecules directly split into
two  smaller  alkenes  through  retro-ene  elimination  pathways,  sur-
mounting a pericyclic transition state. For example, 1-hexene can un-
dergo  retro-ene  reaction  to  form  two  propene  molecules,  which  was
found  to  be  the  major  consumption  pathway  for  1-hexene  at  low

temperature oxidation conditions [105,107].

3.2. Reaction mechanism, reaction classes, and rate rules

Facilitated  by  the  appearance  of  stiff  kinetic  equation  solvers  in
1970s,  numerical  simulations  of  the  combustion  system  were  able  to
deal  with  larger  reaction  mechanisms  including  varied  time  scales
[190]. Since 1980s when Westbrook and Dryer [191,192] put forward
the concept of the hierarchical development of kinetic mechanism for
hydrocarbon fuels, the combustion research community has seen dra-
matic  advances  in  chemical  kinetic  modeling  during  the  last  several
decades. In the reviews of Westbrook et al. [190] and Simmie [193], as
well  as  a  more  recent  review  by  Curran  [194],  brief  history  of  the
development of chemical kinetic mechanisms and the massive previous
efforts  in  chemical  kinetic  modeling  for  hydrocarbon  fuels  were
presented.

Experimental measurements and mechanism studies for C2–C10 al-
kenes,  including  both  low  and  high  temperature  kinetic  schemes,
covering ethylene [25–44], propene [37,45-52], 1,3-butadiene [53–67],
isomers  of  butene  [68–88],  pentene  [13,89-100],  hexene  [10,98,
101-111], heptene [103,112-114], octene [115–117], decene [118,119]
and 2,4,4-trimethyl-1-pentene [120–124] have been taken into consid-
eration in the following discussion. The detailed reaction mechanism for
C2-C4 alkenes is compiled in a hierarchical way which starts from the
oxidation  of  small  hydrocarbons  and  then  continues  by  sequentially
adding  reaction  mechanisms  for  larger  alkenes.  The  1,3-butadiene
mechanism used here is the recently published AramcoMech 3.0 [67]
with base C3–C4 alkenes oxidation mechanism of AramcoMech 2.0 [51,
52,87,88,195]. The base C0-C2 hydrocarbon oxidation mechanism used
here is from the published AramcoMech 1.3 [25], with the H2/CO/O2
sub-mechanism based on the work of K ́eromn`es et al. [196]. All of those
mechanisms  were  developed  at  the  Combustion  Chemistry  Centre  of
National University of Ireland Galway (NUIG). For higher alkenes, few
combustion models are available for the two pentene isomers [92-94,
99,100] of 1-pentene and 2-methyl-2-butene [91,93] at high tempera-
tures to simulate their high temperature ignition delay time and laminar
flame speeds and also for three hexene isomers [10,98,101-111], 1-hex-
ene, 2-hexene and 3-hexene, at both low-temperature (NTC reactivity)
and high-temperature ranges (laminar flame speeds), which can be used
to simulate their combustion phenomena under those conditions. Thus,
the mechanism for C2-C4 alkenes from AramcoMechs [25,51,52,67,87,
88,195],  1-pentene  by  Touchard  et  al.  [98,99],  2-methyl-2-butene  by
Westbrook et al. [91], and linear hexene isomers by Battin-Leclerc et al.

[10]  at  high  temperatures  are  chosen  for  the  present  analysis  and
discussion.

The important reaction classes for alkenes oxidation are discussed
below in detail. Fig. 30 presents a generalized scheme for the primary
mechanism  in  the  oxidation  of  alkenes  including  important  reaction
classes over different temperature ranges, where temperature ranges for
low-,  intermediate-  and  high-temperature  chemistry  can  be  roughly
defined as 600–850 K, 850–1200 K and > 1200 K [194]. Important re-
action  classes  determining  the  reactivity  of  alkene  oxidation  under
different temperatures are assembled in Scheme 1, in sequence along the
oxidation reaction from fuel to fully oxidized products.

The most important point here is that all of these fuel consumption
reaction  pathways  contribute  significantly  to  oxidation  of  alkenes  in
some or all of the temperature ranges relevant for practical combustion
systems. Omitting any of these will severely limit the predictive capa-
bility  of  the  kinetic  mechanism.  In  addition  to  the  completeness  of
possible reaction pathways, assigning rate parameters to each elemen-
tary reaction pathway with sufficient accuracy is also crucial. The un-
derlying uncertainty in rate constants, which may be determined from
experimental measurements, theoretical kinetics or estimations on the
basis of rate rules, is one of the major obstacles to the a priori prediction
for combustion properties of a fuel [197]. Due to improved algorithms
and  increased  computational  resources,  theoretical  reaction  kinetics
calculation  has  been  routinely  employed  in  the  quantitative  de-
terminations of elementary reaction rate constants in the last few de-
cades, with the accuracy of high-level ab initio calculations often rivals
that of direct measurements [185,198]. The global uncertainties in the
predicted phenomenological rate constants arise from the propagation
of parametric uncertainties. Several case studies gave some qualitative
and  quantitative  insights  into  the  uncertainties  in  theoretical  kinetic

calculations. Goldsmith et al. [199] carried out uncertainty analysis for
the master equation calculation of n-propyl + O2 reaction system using a
random  sampling  high-dimensional  model  representation  (HDMR)
approach.  The  fundamental  parameters,  including  reaction  barriers,
vibrational  frequencies,  collisional  energy  transfer  parameters  and
tunneling  corrections,  were  quasi-randomly  sampled  within  their  un-
certainty  range  to  obtain  the  frequency  distributions  of  the  predicted
rate constants. They found that rate constant values distributed at 3σ
variance limits typically differ from the most frequent ones by a factor of
4–6, as a result of the pre-set uncertainties in the underlying parameters.
Generally, the predicted rate constants for well-skipping reactions that
surmount several barriers are more sensitive to the collisional energy
transfer  parameters,  while  those  for  reactions  that  traverse  a  single
transition state are more affected by the uncertainty in barrier height.
Xing et al. [200] employed the same method to investigate the global
uncertainties/sensitivities of RRKM/master equation calculation for the
decomposition of ethanol, as a result of the uncertainties in the input
parameters.  Emphases  were  placed  on  the  temperature  and  pressure
dependences of the global uncertainties and the relative importance of
different  influential  parameters.  Prager  et  al.  [201]  studied  the  para-
metric  uncertainties  of  microcanonical  transition  state  theory  (TST)
calculation  for  H-atom  abstraction  reaction  from  isopropanol  by  hy-
droxyl radical. A number of electronic structure methods were employed
simultaneously to characterize the molecular parameters as well as their
discrepancies.  The  barrier  height,  the  imaginary  frequency  and  the
second lowest vibrational frequency of the transition state were identi-
fied  as  the  major  sources  of  uncertainty  in  this  case.  Assuming  them
uncorrelated, the total uncertainty of the rate constants was found to be
a  factor  of  ~10  at  300  K,  and  decease  to  less  than  a  factor  of  2.5  at
temperatures above 800 K [201]. Aided by reliable measured kinetics
data  and  Bayesian  inference,  posterior  joint  probability  density

3.2.1. Reaction class 1: unimolecular decomposition of alkenes

Bond  dissociation  reactions  can  happen  in  the  alkenes  pyrolysis.
Depending on the different types of C–H and C–C bonds present in al-
kenes, the pyrolysis reaction process can be composed of the following
reaction classes

RH⇌vinylic/allylic + alkylradicals
RH⇌vinylic/allylicradicals +  ̇H

This  reaction  class  may  be  important  in  determining  the  laminar
flame  speeds  for  alkene/air  mixtures.  Theoretical  or  experimental  in-
vestigations on the rate constants of this reaction class are quite limited
in the literature, and Tsang [202] recommended the rate constants for

A

molecular hydrogen shift reaction coupled with dissociation is also one

pyrolysis leads to two propene molecules.

3.2.2. Reaction class 2: H-atom abstraction from alkenes

In alkenes, H atoms can be characterized as allylic, secondary and
tertiary vinylic, as well as primary, secondary, and tertiary hydrogens.
The rate constant for H-atom abstraction depends on the radical species
and the type of H atom being abstracted. As shown previously, C-H bond
in the secondary vinylic moiety is the most difficult to abstract, followed
by  the  tertiary  vinylic  H  atoms,  while  the  allylic  H  atoms  have  the
weakest bonds and are most easily abstracted. The rest of the hydrogen
atoms follow the same order as in alkanes, so that the primary C-H bond
is the strongest followed by the secondary one, and the tertiary C-H bond
is the weakest.

Hydrogen atom abstraction reactions are one of the primary means

by which alkenes are consumed in combustion environments. A variety

of small radical species (e.g., Ḣ,
OH, H
and stable molecule (e.g., O2) can abstract hydrogen atoms from alkenes.
As  the  allylic  C–H  bonds  are  the  weakest  C–H  bonds  in  alkenes,  the
formation of the resonantly stabilized radicals is generally dominant and
they play a very important role in the entire combustion temperature
range.

With relatively low barriers, H-atom abstraction by

the allylic sites consumes the reactive
stabilized  radical,  and  thus  inhibits  the  reactivity  through  the  entire
combustion temperature range. Because of this, the rate constant for this
reaction is particularly important for simulating alkenes reactivity from
500 to 2000 K. Farooq and his group has carried out a series of mea-
surements on the kinetics of this important reaction class [203–205].

H-atom abstraction by molecular oxygen also plays an important role
 ̇
in high temperature oxidation of alkenes which forms allylic and H
O2
radicals  as  a  chain  branching  pathway to  promote  reactivity.  H-atom
abstraction  reactions  by  molecular  oxygen  have  been  measured  for
propene [206] and isobutene [207] in a relatively narrow temperature
range.  The  lack  of  direct  measurements  across  the  entire  combustion
temperatures range thus requires application of computational theory
and estimation methods to determine the appropriate rate coefficients
for these reactions. Very recently, Zhou et al. [208] carried out a series of
investigations on H atom abstraction by molecular oxygen from alkene,
furan, and alkylbenzene families covering the primary, secondary, ter-
tiary, and super secondary allylic hydrogen atoms. Conventional tran-
sition  state  theory  with  Eckart  tunneling  corrections  was  used  to
calculate the rate constants. The implications of the rate constants for
combustion  modeling  of  oxidation  of  different  fuels  have  also  been
considered in this work and it provides a first systematic study of one of
the key initiation reactions for compounds containing allylic hydrogen
atoms.

3.2.3. Reaction classes 3 and 4: vinylic and alkenyl radical decomposition
and isomerization

At  high  temperatures  (e.g.,  above  1000  K)  the  radicals  formed
including  allylic,  secondary,  tertiary  vinylic  and  alkenyl  radicals  can
undergo  unimolecular  decomposition  through  β-scission  reactions.  In
these reactions, the bond in β  position with respect to the radical site

breaks to form unsaturated species with two double bonds (e.g., allene,
1,3-butadiene,  1,2-butadiene,  1,3-pentadiene,  1,2-pentadiene,  etc.)  or
one triple bond (e.g., acetylene, 1-butyne, 1-pentyne, etc.) and another
alkyl radical or hydrogen atom. Isomerization reaction of the allylic fuel
radical can also happen through the H-atom transfer from any carbon
site to the radical site. The rate coefficient for these reactions depends on

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience90(2022)10098324

C.-W. Zhou et al.

the  nature  of  the  broken  and  formed  C–H  bonds  (i.e.,  secondary  and
tertiary  vinylic,  as  well  as  primary,  secondary,  and  tertiary)  and  the
structure of the transition states involved, which ultimately determine
the potential energy barrier.

3.2.4. Reaction class 5: H-atom addition to alkenes

Hydrogen atom addition to alkenes is one of the key reactions that
open the double bond in alkenes oxidation chemistry at high tempera-
tures  and  this  reaction  has  a  significant  influence  on  the  reactivity
prediction of propene [51,52], butene isomers [86–88], pentene isomers
[92,93,98,106], hexene isomers [104,109-111] and 1,3-butadiene [54,
67] oxidation. At high temperatures (> 1200 K), hydrogen atom will add
to  the  double  bond  in  alkenes followed  by  β-scission  reactions  which
mostly produce smaller alkenes and primary alkyl radicals. This reaction
inhibits reactivity, as it competes with the main chain branching and
reactivity promoting reaction, Ḣ + O2 ⇌   ̈
OH. The exception is the
central  addition  of  hydrogen  atom  to  1-butene  [86],  which  can  form
C2H4  +  ̇
C2H5  products and ultimately generate two vinyl radicals and
three hydrogen atoms to promote the reactivity of 1-butene oxidation.
The hydrogen atom addition to the central carbon atom of 1,3-butadiene
[67] forming two vinyl radicals and one hydrogen atom also promotes
reactivity. In summary, for the hydrogen atom addition reactions, if the
products  are  smaller  alkenes (other  than ethylene)  and  primary  alkyl
radicals, that reaction will inhibit reactivity; whilst if the products are
ethylene and hydrogen atom, that reaction will promote reactivity.

O +  ̇

As temperatures decrease, the addition reactions of hydrogen atom
to alkenes can form an alkyl radical which promotes reactivity. The alkyl
radical formed can undergo typical low-temperature chemistry via re-
 ̇
O2 radicals, which can undergo
action with molecular oxygen to form R
 ̇QOOH  radicals.  Those  are  mainly
isomerization  reactions  to  form
consumed by a second molecular oxygen addition reaction, leading to
the formation of ketohydroperoxides (KHP), the decomposition of which
is also a major branching step and promotes the low-temperature reac-
tivity. Noteworthy, the concentration of hydrogen atoms at lower tem-
perature is relatively low and, therefore, the reactivity effect from the Ḣ

 ̈
O-atom addition to alkenes
The  reaction  of  atomic  oxygen  with  alkenes  is  a  fundamental
oxidation step in combustion and is prototypical for reactions in which
oxygen adds to double bonds. It is also another important reaction that
opens the double bond in alkenes oxidation chemistry at high temper-
atures. For this class of reactions generally, decomposition of the initial
adduct via spin-allowed reaction channels on the triplet surface com-
petes with intersystem crossing (ISC) and a set of spin-forbidden reac-
tion channels on the ground-state singlet surface. The two surfaces share
some  bimolecular  products  but  feature  different  intermediates,  path-
ways, and transition states. The overall product branching is, therefore,
a  sensitive  function  of  the  ISC  between  the  triplet  and  the  singlet
potentials.

and theoretically, and they also investigated the products of the reaction
over  an  extended  temperature  range  (298  (cid:0) 905  K)  by  using  a  low
pressure flow reactor combined with a quadrupole mass spectrometer. It
is very interesting to find out that their products branching ratios are
quite different from the experimental and theoretical work carried out
by Casavecchia and Cavallotti [210,211]. Large difference can be found

discrepancy  is  unknown,  however  it  should  be  noted  that  branching
ratio between different products are quite important in determining the
final reactivity of propene oxidation [52], hence these influence to the
reactivity prediction of propene oxidation needs to be investigated in the
future.

under JSR and flow reactor conditions the secondary (
C3H5-s) and ter-
 ̇
tiary (
C3H5-t) vinylic radicals are almost exclusively consumed by the
reaction  with  molecular  oxygen.  For  the  oxidation  of  isobutene  [88],
2-butene [87], and 1-butene [86], we found the same trends that the
vinylic radical reactions with molecular oxygen play a very important
role in the high temperature oxidation of those fuels. This reaction class
has not been mentioned in the oxidation mechanism of pentene isomers
[92-94,  99,100]  and  hexene  isomers  [98,104,105,109-111],  and  this
should  be included as  an important  reaction  class  for vinylic radicals
oxidation.

Apart from the comprehensive investigation on the reaction of vinyl
+ O2  both  experimentally  [214–224]  and  by  theoretical  calculations
[39,213,225-229], to the best of our knowledge, the reactions of sec-
ondary and tertiary vinylic radicals formed from propene, butene iso-
mers, pentene isomers, and hexene isomers with molecular oxygen in
combustion process have not been investigated either experimentally or
theoretically.  Rate  constants  used  in  the  propene  model  is  taken  by
analogy from the high-level ab initio study of Klippenstein et al. [230]
and  those  for  butene  isomers  are  also  taken  by  analogy  from  the
high-level ab initio calculation of Goldsmith et al. [213]. As this reaction
class is of great importance in high temperature oxidation of alkenes, we
recommend that further studies of the total rate constants, the product
channels and the branching ratios need to be carried out.

kinetics of 3  ̈

equation (AITSTME) approach that included an a priori description of

The  radical-radical  recombination  reaction  between  allylic  and
hydroperoxyl radicals and the subsequent dissociation reactions play a
very important role in determining the reactivity of alkenes oxidation
across a range of conditions, especially at low to intermediate temper-
atures [51,52,86-88, 106,109]. Taking propene oxidation for example,
at approximately 875 K and 1 atm in a JSR, the reaction of allyl and

At  elevated  temperatures  and  low-pressures,  the  chemically  acti-
vated  process  of  allylic  radical  reacting  with  hydroperoxyl  radical  to
form alkyl-allyloxy and hydroxyl radicals is favored. However, as tem-
perature decreases and pressure increases, the formation of the stabi-
lized  adduct,  allylic  hydroperoxide  of  RAOOH,  becomes  dominant.
Allylic  hydroperoxide  subsequently  decomposes  to  give  alkyl-allyloxy
and hydroxyl radicals. At combustion relevant conditions, both of the
major  channels  for  the  reaction  of  allylic  radical  and  hydroperoxyl
radical  act  to  promote  reactivity  as  they  ultimately  convert  a  stable
allylic radical to a reactive hydroxyl radical.

The  alkyl-allyloxy  radical  can  undergo  both  decomposition  and
isomerization  reactions  to  produce  different  types  of  products.  The
decomposition reaction can give bi-molecular products such as vinylic
radical  and  aldehydes,  allylic-aldehydes  and  atomic  hydrogen,  and
formyl  and  alkyl  radicals.  The  isomerization  reaction  can  produce
allylic-ether  radicals  which  can  ultimately  form  vinylic  radicals  and
aldehydes.  The comprehensive investigation of  this reaction class  has
only been carried out by Goldsmith et al. [231] for the allyl radical plus
hydroperoxyl radical system, which has been used in the propene [51,
52] and analogously for butenes [86–88] oxidation mechanisms. Due to
the  importance  of  this  reaction  class  in  alkenes  oxidation,  we recom-
mend further theoretical and experimental work.

The recombination reaction of allylic and methyl radicals to give a
larger alkene is an important inhibiting reaction for alkene combustion,
especially at intermediate temperatures [52,88]. This chain termination
reaction acts to inhibit reactivity for ignition delay time determination.
The  larger  alkenes  formed  will  also  undergo  the  important  reaction
classes listed in Scheme 1 for alkenes oxidation.

3.2.9. Reaction classes 15-16: self-recombination reaction of allylic
radicals and the subsequent oxidation mechanism (ṘA+ṘA⇌ RA–RA, RA–RA

Allylic radicals can undergo self-recombination to form larger diene
RA-RA  molecules. This chain termination reaction inhibits reactivity at
low and intermediate temperatures [52,88]. Hydrogen atom abstraction
can also happen between the two allylic radicals to form alkenes and
dienes.  However, the contribution  from this reaction channel is quite
limited and can be neglected.

 ̇
CH3 radicals,

As  shown  in  Fig.  30,  the  formed  larger  dienes  can  go  through
hydrogen atom abstraction reactions to form fuel radicals, among which
the allylic radicals are dominant and should be paid special attention to.
 ̈
Hydrogen atom abstraction by
O and Ḣ atoms, and
molecular  oxygen  are  important  reactions  for  the  oxidation  of  these
larger dienes. Rate constants of these reactions can be estimated based
on their BDE and the number of hydrogen atoms available for abstrac-
tion by analogy with alkenes. The formation of larger dienes is impor-
 ̇
tant  at  intermediate  temperatures  at  which  the  H
O2  radical  reacting
with  the  allylic  diene  radicals  should  be  taken  into  consideration,  as
shown  in  Fig.  30.  The  allylic  diene  radicals  formed  can  also  undergo
β-scission  to  yield  smaller  dienes  and  allylic  radicals.  These  reactions
will slow down the ignition delay times of alkene oxidation and give a
pronounced contribution in the allylic radical consumption.

competing with each other. It is interesting to note that the alkene +
 ̇
O2  reaction takes place on the same potential energy surface as the
H
alkyl + O2 one, which makes the alkenes chemistry linked with alkanes
chemistry. At low temperatures, the formation of the alkylperoxy radical
is favored due to the lower barrier height, while at higher temperatures
the hydroperoxyalkyl and /or oxirane +  ̇
OH formation is faster because
of the looser transition state structure.

However,  the  direct  experimental  investigation  of  alkene  + H

reactions is difficult, because these reactions are slow and not all reac-
tion  products  are  easily  detectable  with  standard  experimental  tech-
niques.  Z ́ador  et  al.  [232]  have  thoroughly
investigated  the
comprehensive pressure and temperature dependent rate constants for
reactions  of  seven  alkenes  (i.e.,  ethylene,  propene,  1-butene,
 ̇
trans-2-butene,  isobutene,  cis-cyclo-C6H10  and  ethenol)  with  H
O2.
RRKM/ME analysis was used to calculate the temperature and pressure
dependent  rate  constants  based  on  the  PES  obtained  at  the  QCISD

 ̇
O2 adds almost exclusively to the sp2 carbon atom with more alkyl
that H
groups attached in non-conjugated alkenes, and this finding is qualita-
tively in accordance with the calculated differences in charge transfer in
the  transition states. Due  to the importance  of this reaction  class, we
recommend that further theoretical work on other alkenes with hydro-
peroxyl radical is necessary.

O2  radical isomerization (R

When we take 2-butene as an example, one of the reaction steps can

be shown as:

In the low-temperature oxidation regime (i.e., 500 to 900 K), isom-
 ̇
erization  of  R
O2  becomes  rapid,  resulting  in  substantial  flux  through
 ̇QOOH. However, rapid decomposition, isomerization, and reaction with
 ̇QOOH faster than it is formed. It is well established
O2 typically remove

O2  radicals  to  form  the  hydroperoxyalkyl
that  isomerization  of  the  R
 ̇QOOH  proceeds  through  the  intramolecular  H-atom  transfer
radicals
involving  ring-shaped  transition  states.  The  isomerizations  in  alkyl
radicals can be categorized according to the positions of the heavy atoms
between which the H atom is transferred and the type of C–H bond being
broken. The barrier heights for these isomerizations depend on the size
of the ring and on the strength of the C–H bond broken in the isomeri-
zation.  Z ́ador  et  al.  [233]  have  discussed  the  kinetics  and  thermody-
namics of this reaction class comprehensively, hence further discussion
on this reaction class will not be provided here.

mass spectrometry with synchrotron-generated tunable vacuum ultra-

reactivity of resonance stabilized
cals may be relatively long-lived in combustion systems. Goldsmith et al.
[235] selected the smallest hydrocarbon, propane, which has the NTC
behavior  as  a  target  molecule  to  investigate  the  low  temperature
oxidation mechanisms. They examined the role of O2  +  ̇QOOH chem-
istry  in  low-temperature  alkyl  autoignition,  employing  ab  initio
transition-state theory based master-equation calculations to determine
many of the key rate constants for the propane oxidation system.

3.2.13. Reaction class 25: ṘA  + O2  ⇌ dienes + H

O2

The addition of O2 to alkyl radical and subsequent reaction pathways
are the main low temperature branching pathways for alkane oxidation.
On the contrary, for alkenes, the addition of O2 to allylic radicals does
not play an important role in the alkene low temperature oxidation. For
 ̇
alkanes, the heat release of the entrance channel (Ṙ + O2 ⇌ R

1-butene [86]. The forward concerted elimination of RA
and  hydroperoxyl  radical  needs  to  overcome  the  barrier  of  ~27  kcal
(cid:0) 1  which  is  higher  than  that  for  the  reverse  dissociation  reaction
mol
back  to form  allylic radical  and  molecular  oxygen. Thus,  dissociation
back  to  ṘA  + O2  is  favored  over  the  higher  barrier  isomer-
ization/elimination reaction processes.

Rather than the addition reaction to happen between allylic radical
and molecular oxygen, hydrogen-atom abstraction from the β-site of the
allylic radical by molecular oxygen is more likely  to happen and this
reaction promotes reactivity, as it consumes a stabilized allylic radical to
generate a more reactive hydroperoxy radical. Considerable amount of
the  allylic  fuel  radicals  were  found  to  be  consumed  by  H-atom
abstraction reaction by O2  in, for example, the oxidation of 1- and 2-
butene  [86,87].  It  is  worth  noting  that  the  reaction  ṘA+O2  ⇌  dienes
 ̇
+ H
O2 is not chemically activated via the reaction pathway of ṘA + O2 ⇌

The  fate  of  hydroperoxyalkyl  radicals

 ̇QOOH  is  central  to  the
 ̇QOOH  can
modeling  of  autoignition.  Unimolecular  decomposition  of
 ̇
OH radical and, therefore, it plays an important role
produce a reactive
in radical chain propagation. Alternatively, a second molecular oxygen
 ̇
 ̇QOOH to form a hydroperoxyalkylperoxy radical,
can add to
O2QOOH
 ̇
OH + keto-
which can rapidly isomerize and dissociate to form either
 ̇
O2  + alkenyl  hydroperoxide.  These  bimolecular
hydroperoxide  or  H
products can also be formed directly from the O2 +  ̇QOOH reactants via
chemical  activation.  Furthermore,  the  O–OH  bonds  in  the  keto-
hydroperoxides  and  alkenyl  hydroperoxides  are  relatively  weak,  and
these intermediates can further decompose to oxy-radicals +  ̇
OH at low
temperatures. Consequently, the addition of a second molecular oxygen
 ̇QOOH  can  produce  three  radicals from  every  radical  consumption
to
which is the important chain-branching pathway to promote the reac-
tivity below ~ 900 K. A thorough review of experimental and theoretical
work on this reaction can be found in Z ́ador et al. [233].

Although these chemistry pathways can explain the low temperature

OH radicals addition to

Low  temperature  chemistry  for  alkenes  oxidation  is  illustrated  in
Fig. 31. The addition reactions of hydroxyl radical to the double bond in
alkenes plays a very important role in determining the reactivity of al-
kenes oxidation when temperature is lower than 850 K. Depending on
the position of the double bond in alkenes, the hydroxyl radical can add
to either the terminal or central carbon atom. For this specific reaction,
branching ratios between these two additions, along with temperature
changes,  is  far  more important  than the  total rate  constants  in  deter-
mining the alkenes reactivity. That is because the formed hydroxyl ad-
ducts  can  undergo  different  reaction  pathways  which  have  different
impact on determining the reactivity of alkenes oxidation. Taking the

the branching ratio to 75:25 in favor of addition to the terminal carbon
to  give  a  good  reactivity  prediction.  The  same  trends  have  also  been
found  in  butene  isomers  oxidation  [86–88].  This  adjustment  is  also
consistent with the experimental study carried out by Loison et al. [237]
who found 72 ± 16% of hydroxyl radical addition to propene and 71 ±
16% to 1-butene, with both favoring the terminal carbon addition. On
the other hand, for 1-hexene oxidation, Battin-Leclerc et al. [109] re-
ported that the use of the 50:50 branching ratio for the addition to the
terminal or central carbon atom as suggested by Z ́ador et al. [236] for
propene  is  appropriate,  which  is  quite  different  from  smaller  alkenes
oxidation [52,87,88].

The obtained adducts of hydroxyalkyl radicals can undergo isomer-
ization and decomposition reactions to form smaller molecules such as
aldehydes and alkyl radicals. Detailed reaction mechanism can be found
in the works of Z ́ador et al. [236] and Zhou et al. [238] for the addition
reaction of hydroxyl radical to propene. Due to the importance of the
branching ratios for the entrance channel in the alkenes reactivity pre-
diction, further theoretical or calculation studies on this topic will be
valuable for understanding the fuel chemistry.

3.2.15. Reaction class 27: α-hydroxyalkyl + O2  ⇌ aldehyde/ketone +

 ̇
O2

The  addition  of  hydroxyl  radical  to  the  double  bond  is  a  major
consumption  pathway  at  low  temperatures  and  the  hydroxyl  adducts
can isomerize to α-hydroxyalkyl radicals. Molecular oxygen will react
with the α-hydroxyalkyl radicals to directly form an aldehyde/ketone
 ̇
and H
O2  radical rapidly in the atmosphere. Theoretical studies on the
elementary reactions of hydroxyalkyl radicals with O2 are quite limited
and  mainly  focus  on  small  reaction  systems  of  hydroxymethyl
[239–241],  α-hydroxyethyl,  [240,242,243],  β-hydroxyethyl,  [242]
2-hydroxy-1,1-dimethylethyl  [244]  and  2-hydroxy-2-methylpropyl
[244].  Experimental  studies  of  the  reaction  of  hydroxyalkyl  radical
with  molecular  oxygen  reactions  at  engine  relevant  conditions  have
been carried out only for hydroxylmethyl [241] and α- and β-hydrox-
yethyl [242]. The study from Z ́ador et al. [242] and Silva et al. [243]
showed that the reaction of α-hydroxyethyl + O2  proceeds through an
activated  α-hydroxy-ethylperoxy  adduct  that  rapidly  decomposes  to

acetaldehyde + H
O2 radical. These reactions have been included in the
mechanism of n-butanol [245,246] and isobutanol [247] oxidation.

3.2.16. Reaction class 28: ṘOH+O2  ⇌ Waddington products

The

 ̇
OH  radical  addition  to  the  double  bond  in  alkenes  produces
hydroxyalkyl radicals which can also be formed in the low temperature
oxidation  of  alcohols,  which  links  the  low  temperature  chemistry  of
alkenes and alcohols. The hydroxyalkyl radical will further react with
 ̇
O)
molecular  oxygen  to  form  the  hydroxyalkyl  peroxy  radical  (ROHO
[248]. Rate constants for this first O2 addition depends on whether the
radical carbon is in an α position to the hydroxyl group or at the primary,
secondary, or tertiary site.

 ̇
The  ROHO
O  radical  can  isomerize  to  form  hydroxyalkyl  hydro-
 ̇QHOHOOH) through the 5-member, 6-member, and 7-
peroxyl radicals (
member transition state rings. Rate constants for those reactions have
not been studied extensively and the estimation of the kinetics has been
used in the model development for alcohols [249,250] and alkenes [52,
86-88, 98,109,111]. The rate constants for the isomerization depend on
the nature of the broken C–H bond (i.e., primary, secondary and tertiary)
and the number of atoms in the ring structure of the transition state. The
charge transfers from oxygen lone pairs to the α σ*CH orbital will make
the α C–H bond much weaker than a normal C–H bond in alkane [251]
and this effect should be taken into consideration when the barriers for
the H-atom transfer are  estimated. Waddington and co-workers [252,
 ̇
253] proposed the mechanism involving the β-RO
O radical undergoing a
six-membered  ring  isomerization  to  abstract  an  Ḣ  atom  from  the  hy-
droxyl moiety and decompose rapidly afterwards. This reaction process
is called the Waddington mechanism which involves chain propagating
reaction  pathways  and competes  directly  with low-temperature chain
branching  pathways  and  hence  inhibits  low-temperature  reactivity.
Apart from the six-membered ring transition state structure, Welz et al.
[254–256] investigated the low temperature chemistry of butanol iso-
mers and isopentanol oxidation and stated that the Waddington mech-
 ̇
 ̇
anism can also happen for the γ-RO
O and δ-RO
O radicals abstracting the
hydrogen  atom  from  the  OH  group  through  7-  and  8-membered  ring

Isomerization rate constant not only depend  on the type of hydrogen
being transferred (whether it is an α to the hydroxyl group or primary,
secondary,  or  tertiary)  but  also  depend  on  the  ring  structure  of  the
transition states whether it is a 4-, 5-, 6-, 7-, or 8-membered ring.

This reaction class is an important initiation step for determining the
formation  of  the  chain  branching  radical  pool  precursor  of  hydrox-
yketohydroperoxide  and  is  competitive  with  the  chain  propagation
Waddington  reaction  pathways.  Hence,  branching  ratio  between  this
reaction  class  and  the  Waddington  reaction  pathway  is  crucially
important  in  determining  the  low  temperature  reactivity  of  alkenes
oxidation. In order to give an initial picture of the competition between
these reaction channels, the potential energy surface for the involved
reaction channels has been calculated in this work at G4 and CBS-QB3
levels of theory, as shown in Fig. 32, taking 1-pentene oxidation as an
example.  As  can  be  seen  in  the  PES,  even  though  the  Waddington
mechanism is very  well known and  considered as the most dominant
reaction pathway for those reaction processes, the isomerization reac-
tion  pathway  abstracting  the  secondary  hydrogen  atom  via  the  six-
member  transition  state  holds  an  even  lower  energy  barrier  than  the
(cid:0) 1  at  the  G4  level  of
Waddington  reaction  pathways  by  0.8  kcal  mol
theory.  Nevertheless,  other  isomerization  reaction  pathways  forming
seven- and five-membered ring structures in the transition states are also
competitive  which  should  be  taken  into  consideration  in  model
development.

Theoretical studies have been carried out by Olivella et al. [257] and
Kuwata  et  al.  [258]  to  investigate  the  unimolecular  reactions  of
β-hydroxyethylperoxy  radical,  with  the  highest  level  of  theory  in  po-
tential  energy  surface  characterization  being  CCSD(T)/6-311+G(3df,
2p)//B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) in both studies. The Waddington pathway was
found  to  be  the  most  important  unimolecular  reaction  channel  for
β-hydroxyethylperoxy,  while  peroxyl  group  abstracting  the  α-H  atom
traversing  a  five-membered-ring  TS  and  HO2  concerted  elimination
pathway  for  β-hydroxyethylperoxy  radical  are  less  competitive.
Lizardo-Huerta  et  al.  [259]  employed  the  CBS-QB3  method  and  con-
ventional  TST  theory  to  systematically  investigate  the  unimolecular
 ̇
reactions of 50 β-HORO
O radicals, where internal H-transfer (through a
five, six or seven-membered cyclic TS, and Waddinton mechanism) and
HO2  elimination  pathways  were  taken  into  consideration  for  the

 ̇
β-HORO
O radicals. Special attention was placed on the intramolecular
effects,  such  as  the  location  of  the  hydroxyl  or  methyl  groups  in  the
cyclic TSs, or the substitution of H atom by alkyl groups on the carbon
atom bonded to the peroxyl group.

hydrogen atom being abstracted bound to the α-carbon of the  hydro-
peroxide group (OOH) has a lower C–H bond strength than a normal
C–H bond, which makes it easier to abstract.

alkenes when the number of carbons is larger than five (C ≥ 6).

It should be noted that the low temperature reactivity of a fuel is
controlled by the ability to form ketohydroperoxides which can lead to
the  chain  branching  radical  pool.  In contrast  to alkanes  in  which  the
alkyl radicals are the source for the formation of ketohydroperoxides, for
alkene  low  temperature  chemistry,  the  formation  of  hydroxyalkyl
 ̇
OH radical addition to the C=C double bond and the for-
radical from
mation of alkenyl radical are the sources of hydroxyketohydroperoxides
and  alkenylketohydroperoxides,  respectively.  The  hydroxyketohy-
droperoxides and alkenylketohydroperoxides can be formed when the
number of carbon atoms in the fuel molecule is larger than two and five,
respectively. Reaction channels forming Waddington products are very
competitive with the ones forming hydroxyketohydroperoxides and the
formation of allylic radical is more favored than that of alkenyl radicals,
and  hence,  even  though  there  are  two  sources  for  the  formation  of
ketohydroperoxides  in  alkenes,  they  are  less  reactive  than  their  satu-
rated counterparts at low temperatures.

3.3. Model validation and analysis

Ignition delay time and laminar flame burning velocity are crucial
characteristics of fuel combustion from both fundamental and practical
considerations and are often used as key parameters for chemical kinetic
mechanisms validation and optimization. Simulating the concentrations
of intermediates and product species is important for analyzing reaction
pathways and emissions. Experimental studies of alkenes’ ignition delay
times, laminar flame speeds and speciation were described in detail in
Section 2. Here, we will discuss those studies in the context of model
validation. Experimental data from newer studies are favored over older
data for discussion and analysis. For the combustion chemistry for each
alkene,  important  elementary  reactions  involved  in  determining  the
reactivity of the fuel will also be fully discussed.

All  simulations  were  conducted  with  CHEMKIN-PRO  [260]  using
appropriate  reactor  modules.  Premixed  laminar  flame  simulations
accounted for thermal diffusion, assumed mixture-averaged transport,
and the solutions were grid-independent by assigning GRAD and CURV
values of 0.02. The mixed-averaged diffusion method for calculating the
transport coefficients was used. Burner-stabilized premixed flames were
simulated  using  the  experimentally  measured  temperature  profile  as
boundary condition.

3.4. The combustion chemistry of ethylene

Ethylene is the simplest alkene and is one of the key intermediates in
the oxidation of higher hydrocarbons. Therefore, it plays an important
role  in  the  combustion  chemistry  of  most  practical  fuels.  Moreover,
ethylene itself is a very reactive fuel and can be formed easily from JP-
type  fuel  cracking  and  decomposition  for  high-speed  air-breathing
propulsion applications of pulse detonation engines and scramjet [16].
Notable  comprehensive  reaction  mechanisms  described  for  ethylene
oxidation capable to reproduce available experimental data are those by
Konnov [27], Xu and Konnov [26], AramchMech 1.3 [25], San Diego
mechanism  (UCSD)  [28]  and  USC  mechanism  [29].  The  ethylene
mechanism of USC [29] has been validated extensively against experi-
mental measurements of ignition delays in shock tubes, laminar flame
speeds, and species profiles in flames. The UCSD mechanism [28] has
also been validated against laminar flame speed and ignition delay time.
Mechanism  from  Konnov  [26,27]  has  been  validated  against  ignition
and  flame  propagation.  The ethylene  mechanism of  AramchMech  1.3
[25] has been validated extensively against experimental measurements
of ignition delay time in shock tubes, laminar flame speeds, speciation
profiles  in  flame,  flow  reactor,  and  jet-stirred  reactor.  Very  recently,
Kikui et al. [30] investigated the combustion and ignition characteristics
of four alkenes (ethylene, propylene, 1-butene and 1-pentene) using a
micro-flow  reactor.  They  also  conducted  reaction  path  analysis  to

examine the high reactivity of ethylene and stated that the formation of
 ̇
H
CO  radical  is  a  key  factor  in  determining  the  reactivity  of  ethylene
oxidation. H-atom addition reaction of ethylene where the reaction oc-
curs at the double bond of ethylene is a unique reaction compared with
alkanes and consumes a significant amount of ethylene. Table presents
experimentally  measured  and  theoretically  calculated  reaction  rate
constants  available  in  the  literature  for  ethylene-related  reactions,
(Table 2).

3.4.1. Low temperature chemistry of ethylene combustion

C2H4  +  ̇

OH  ⇌  Products.  Hydrogen  atom  abstraction  by  hydroxyl
radical from ethylene is a very important reaction promoting the reac-
tivity of ethylene oxidation as it produces a very reactive vinyl radical
which can continue to react with molecular oxygen to chain branching
pathways. This reaction has been studied extensively by experimental
measurements and documented by Vasu et al. [285]. Vasu et al. [285]
measured the reaction rates of hydroxyl radicals with ethylene behind
reflected shock wave in the temperature range 973–1438 K for pressure
from 2 to 10 atm. Their total rate constants are in good agreement with
previous  experimental  measurements  and  the  theoretical  calculation
results  provided  by  Senosiain  et  al.  [286]  are  40%  higher  for  the
hydrogen  atom  abstraction  reaction  channel.  Senosiain  et  al.  [286]
performed  theoretical  calculations  for  the  abstraction  and  total  rate
constants  with  electronic  energy  barriers  and  vibrational  frequencies
calculated at the RQCISD(T)/cc-pV∞Z//UQCISD/6-311++G(d,p) level
of theory, with potential energy surface shown in Fig. 33. Rate constants
of the following reaction channels have been investigated extensively.
C2H4 +  ̇OH⇌  ̇C2H3 + H2O
⇌  ̇CH3 + CH2O
⇌C2H3OH +  ̇H
⇌CH3CHO +  ̇H
⇌p  ̇C2H4OH

Theoretical  calculation  results  from  Senosiain  et  al.  [286]  were
adopted by Metcalfe et al. [25] in the AramcoMech 1.3 development,
and  they  also documented  the  comparison  of  the  rate  constants  from
Vasu  et  al.  [285]  and  Senosiain  et  al.  [286].  Theoretical  calculations
from  Senosiain  et  al.  [286]  confirm  that  when  temperature  is  higher
than  850  K,  hydrogen  abstraction  channel  becomes  more  important.
Branching ratio analysis carried out by Metcalfe et al. [25] found that
the importance of the stabilization to 2-ethylhydroxyl radical increases
at higher pressures, with its formation being dominant from low tem-
peratures to ≈ 900 K at atmospheric pressure but persisting to almost
1250 K at 1000 atm. Recently, Khaled et al. [287] has measured the rate
 ̇
constants for the reaction of
OH radicals with ethylene and also found
that the association pathways become negligible for T > 700 K.

mochemical kinetic analysis for the reaction of H
O2 radical addition to
the  primary,  secondary,  and  tertiary  carbon–carbon  double  bonds  of
ethylene, propene, and isobutene using canonical transition state the-
ory.  Thermochemical  properties  of  reactants,  alkyl  hydroperoxides,
hydroperoxy  alkyl  radicals  were  determined  by  ab  initio  and  density
functional calculations. The authors only provided the rate constants for
the  entrance  addition channels  and  no information  was  given  for  the
subsequent isomerization or decomposition reactions. It is interesting to

note  that  ethylene  + H

O2. However, from Fig. 34, we

can see that for the reaction of ethylene + H
O2,  the formation of the
ethylperoxy  radical  is  favored  at  low  temperatures  due  to  the  lower

3.4.3. High temperature chemistry of ethylene combustion

C2H4 (+M) ⇌ Products.
The C–H bond dissociation reaction is the one most likely to happen
for  ethylene  decomposition.  Alternatively,  H2  elimination  reaction  to
form acetylene is also a favored reaction channel at high temperatures.
Farooq and co-workers [293] undertook time-resolved measurements of
acetylene behind reflected shock waves at temperatures of 1600–2200 K

and  pressures  of  3–5  bar  for  ethylene  pyrolysis.  They  measured  time
histories of acetylene mole fraction from the absorption of a quantum
cascade  laser  operating  around  13.6  μm  without  providing  rate  con-
stants  for  the  H2  elimination  reaction.  Georgievskii  and  Klippenstein

C2H3  + O2  ⇌  Products.  The  vinyl  radical  reaction  with  molecular
oxygen  is  of  crucial  importance  to  ethylene  oxidation.  It  also  plays  a
significant role in the reactivity of larger hydrocarbon fuels as ethylene
can  be  formed  in  significant  concentrations  via  hydrogen  abstraction
followed  by  β-scission.  Sensitivity  analysis  for  ethylene/air  oxidation
under shock tube conditions carried out by Metcalfe et al. [25] shows
that  when  temperature  goes  to  above  1100  K,  the  channel  forming

reacting with molecular oxygen and forming different products domi-
nates  the  reactivity  of  ethylene  oxidation.  This  key  reaction  having
numerous  product  channels,  some  of  which  are  chain  branching  and
some of which are chain propagating, has been investigated extensively
by  both  experiments  [214–224]  and  theoretical  calculations  [39,213,
225-229] in the literature. Results from the prior literature have been
discussed in detail by Goldsmith et al. [213] and Metcalfe et al. [25]. The
temperature- and pressure dependent rate constants calculations using
VRC-TST, and conventional transition state theory as implemented in
the  RRKM/ME  approach  in  the  MESS  code  have  been  carried  out  by
Goldsmith  et  al.  [213].  They  proposed  that  the  main  bimolecular

O  ⇌Products.  The  reaction  between  ethylene  and  atomic
oxygen  is  also  important  in  promoting  the  reactivity  of  ethylene
oxidation as it is a chain-branching pathway. This reaction has received
much attention and has been investigated extensively in the literature
both by theoretical calculations [209,295] and experiments [296–302].
A weakly bound complex on a triplet surface is formed first and this is
followed  by  rearrangement  or  dissociation  to  form  several  sets  of
products. The  system  can also  change  its  electron spin and  transition
non-adiabatically  to  the  singlet  surface,  where  it  can  undergo  a
completely different set of rearrangements and dissociations. The total
rate constant of this reaction appears to be reasonably well established
experimentally over a wide range of temperatures but not the product
distribution.  Recently,  Li  et  al.  [209]  applied  the  AITSTME  approach
that includes an a priori description of intersystem crossing, to study the
kinetics of 3  ̈
O + C2H4  comprehensively and determined the branching
ratios of different product sets at different temperatures and pressures.

After hydrogen atom addition to acetylene and ethylene, the bond en-
ergies are relatively low and the radical tends to dissociate rapidly back
to the reactants. This is particularly significant at elevated temperatures
as the Ḣ atom produced is free to undergo chain branching with mo-
lecular oxygen. The reverse of this reaction is also the decomposition of
vinyl  and  ethyl  radicals.  The  rate  constants  of  these  reactions  are
important in determining such global combustion properties as laminar
flame speed, extinction, and ignition limit. Rate constants of the addi-
tion  reaction  have  been  investigated  extensively  by  experiments  at
temperatures  below  1000  K,  as  reviewed  by  Miller  and  Klippenstein
[303]  who  highlighted
lack  of  experimental  studies  at
combustion-relevant  conditions.  The  most  complete  theoretical  treat-
ments of the reactions of interest here are those of Knyazev and Slagle
[304] for Ḣ + C2H2 and Feng et al. [305] for Ḣ + C2H4. The theoretical
work from Miller and Klippenstein [303] improved on these studies by
using variational transition-state theory, high-level electronic-structure
calculations to characterize the stationary-point regions of the PES, and
used a two-dimensional master equation in calculating the number of
states for both E and J which is more accurate than the one dimensional
ME  used  by  Feng  et  al.  [305].  The  ethylene  mechanism  provided  by
Metcalfe et al. [25] in AramchMech 1.3 adopted the theoretical results
from Miller and Klippenstein [303] by reducing both the high-pressure
and  low-pressure  limits  of the  addition  reaction  by  30% to  achieve  a
better agreement with high temperature ignition delay measurements.
This adjustment is reasonable and within the uncertainty of the theo-
retical calculation.

3.4.4. Ethylene combustion mechanism

The  ethylene  mechanism  utilized  here  is  from  AramcoMech  1.3
which  was  developed  by  Metcalfe et  al.  [25].  Rate  constants of  vinyl
radical + O2 in AramcoMech 1.3 were estimated by Metcalfe based on
comprehensive comparison and review of previous theoretical calcula-
tions and also the model behavior on the ignition delay times of ethylene
oxidation  at  different  temperatures  and  pressures.  By  taking  the  rate
constants from the recent theoretical work of Goldsmith et al. [213] for
vinyl radical + O2 and substituting them for the estimated values used
by Metcalfe et al., and after making few changes in the rate constants
 ̇
C2H3 + O2 ⇌   ̇
(increasing the rate constants for
O by 10% and

 ̇
C2H3 + O2 ⇌ CH2O + H
decreasing the rate constants for
CO by 10%) the
revised model can capture all the targets related to ethylene oxidation
provided  by  Metcalfe  et  al.  [25].  We  utilize  AramcoMech  1.3  in  this
work  for  its  comprehensive  development  and  testing  for  ethylene,  as
well as hydrogen [196], hydrogen/CO mixtures [196], methane, ethane,
formaldehyde,  which  are  all  relevant  to  ethylene  combustion.  The

0.3–2.0), Saxena et al. [33] (C2H4/O2/Ar, 1000–1650 K, 2.0–18.0 atm,

φ = 2.5) and Lopez [39] (C2H4/O2/N2, 600–900 K, 60 atm, φ = 1.0, 5.0),
laminar flame speeds from Hassan et al. [40] (C2H4/Air, 298 K, 1 and 2
atm, φ = 0.5–1.4), Egolfopoulos et al. [41] (C2H4/Air, 298 K, 1 atm, φ =
0.5–2.2),  Jomaas  et  al.  [42]  (C2H4/Air,  298  K,  1,  2  and  5  atm,  φ  =
0.7–1.4), and Kumar et al. [43] (C2H4/Air, 298, 360 and 470 K, 1 atm, φ
= 0.9–1.6), and flame species profiles from Bhargava and Westmoreland
[44]  (C2H4/O2/Ar,  300  K,  20  Torr,  φ  = 1.9).  AramcoMech  1.3  can
capture the above-mentioned experimental measurements of IDT quite
well.

Shao et al. [140] measured ignition delay time of small hydrocarbons
including  methane,  ethylene,  propene  and  their  blends  at  elevated
pressures, and provided a valuable constraint for the refinement of the
core  small-hydrocarbon  sub-mechanisms  used  in  all  combustion  ki-
netics. They found that both the AramcoMech 1.3 and USC Mech2 over
predicted the reactivity at 16 atm and T > 1200 K. However, Aramco-
Mech 1.3 showed a very low equivalence ratio dependence which was in
good agreement with their measurements. Moreover, the AramcoMech
1.3 also predicted the high pressure (60 atm) IDT data very closely. On
the other hand, the USC Mech2 did not capture the equivalence ratio
dependence  at  16  atm  and  also  pronouncedly  over  predicted  the
ethylene  reactivity  at  60  atm.  Apart  from  the  vinyl  + O2  reaction,
 ̈
O atom addition to ethylene
pressure-dependent rate constants for the
calculated  by  Li  et  al.  [209]  needs  to  be  updated  in  the  ethylene
mechanism of AramcoMech.

3.5. The combustion chemistry of propene

Propene is a significant component of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG)
and  a  key  intermediate  in  the  combustion  of  higher  paraffins  (e.g.,
propane, n-butane, n-heptane, and iso-octane), cycloparaffins, or from
the side chain of alkylbenzenes [307]. It can be formed either through
the pyrolysis of fuel molecules  or β-scission of fuel radicals. As a key

hierarchical  component,  it  is  very  important  to  understand  the  com-
bustion characteristics of propene. Apart from the importance of pro-
pene itself, the resonance stabilized allyl radical can easily be formed
 ̈
O, etc., from
through H-atom abstraction by
the allylic hydrogen atom. The allyl radical is also relevant to the for-
mation of aromatics via allene, propyne, and the propargyl radical, the
key PAH precursor.

sively in the literature [37,45-52] and have been documented by Burke
et  al.  [52].  Westbrook  and  Pitz  [47]  developed  a  comprehensive
chemical  kinetic  model  for  oxidation  and  pyrolysis  of  propane  and
propene. Based on this work, five years later, Wilk et al. [48] developed
a detailed chemical kinetic mechanism for propene oxidation at low and
intermediate  temperatures  to  simulate  the  static  reactor  data.  They
 ̇
highlighted the importance of the addition of
OH to propene and H-atom
 ̇
abstraction by
OH from propene in determining the subsequent distri-
butions of intermediate products, such as acetaldehyde, acrolein, and
formaldehyde. They measured the NTC behavior and also predicted it by
their model. The occurrence of multiple cool flames was also predicted
in the model at the same temperatures as recorded in the experiment.

Dagaut  et  al.  [45]  developed  a  comprehensive  mechanism  to
reproduce  their  JSR  speciation  data.  Le  Cong  [37]  investigated  the
propene  oxidation  in  the  presence  of  CO2  and  H2O  in  a  jet-stirred
reactor,  and  an  updated  reaction  mechanism  based  on  the  one  pub-
lished by Dagaut et al. [45] was used to simulate the experimental re-
sults.  Braun-Unkhoff  et  al.  [50]  developed  a  propene  model  and
validated it against the laminar flame speed and ignition delay time of
different propene-oxygen mixtures. Davis and Law [46] also proposed a
detailed  chemical  kinetic  mechanism  for  propene  oxidation.  Their
mechanism  has  been  validated  against  experimental  measurements
taken in flow reactor as well as flame speed data.

Heyberger  et  al.  [49]  generated  the  detailed  mechanism  for  the
oxidation and combustion of propene by their EXGAS code. The mech-
anism  was  validated  against  the  data  obtained  in  a  static  vessel  and
jet-stirred reactor. The mechanism reproduced correctly both the NTC
observed  at  ~  630  K  and  the  variations  of  the  concentrations  with
residence time of C3H6, CO, CO2, CH4, C2H2, C2H4, etc. They also carried
out flux and sensitivity analyses to get insight into the kinetic structure
of the mechanism, e.g., NTC behavior of the mechanism. They stated
that at low temperatures, the NTC is mainly due to the reversibility of
 ̇
C3H6OH,  which  yields
the  molecular  oxygen  addition  to  the  adduct,
degenerate branching agents via a mechanism similar to that of alkyl
radicals and two additions of oxygen.

Very  recently,  Burke  et  al.  [51,52]  developed  the  comprehensive
model for propene oxidation and  pyrolysis. The model has been vali-
dated against new  experimental data for  ignition delay  time, laminar
flame speed, and speciation profiles from jet-stirred and flow reactors
over  a  wide  range  of  temperature  and  pressures.  As  the  mechanism
developed by Burke et al. [51,52] has been extensively validated over a
wide  range  of  experimental  measurements,  it  will  be  used  in  the
following  discussion.  The  important  reaction  classes  have  also  been
highlighted by Burke et al. [52] and here we focus on the ones updated
recently.

3.5.1. High temperature chemistry of propene combustion

C3H6  (+M) ⇌  Products. The detailed model for propene oxidation
developed by Burke et al. [52] shows that the propene/air laminar flame
speeds  are  sensitive  to  propene  decomposition  to  allyl  radical  and  a
hydrogen atom. Unimolecular decomposition of propene has received
much attention both theoretically and experimentally in the literature
which has been documented by Wang et al. [308] and Ye et al. [309].
Recently, Wang et al. [308] developed a mechanism that describes the
molecular  weight  growth  kinetics  observed  during  propene  pyrolysis.
They  carried  out  propene  pyrolysis  experiments  at  848–1148  K  with
nominal residence times of ~ 2.4, 1.2 and 0.5 s at ~ 0.83 atm. Ye et al.

[309]  performed  high-level  ab  initio  calculations  on  unimolecular
decomposition of propene using the VRC-TST to treat the radical-radical
recombination reaction processes. Their results show that the reaction
 ̇
C2H3 +  ̇
channels forming allyl + Ḣ and
CH3 are the two main compet-
itors. Hung et al. [310] also studied this reaction system both theoreti-
cally  and  experimentally.  The  potential  energy  surface  for  possible
reaction  channels  was  investigated  at  the  CBS-QB3  level  of  theory,
coupled with RRKM/ME calculations for the main reaction pathways.
Experimental measurement has also been carried out by using a highly
sensitive detection technique behind reflected shock waves at 2 atm and
1450–1710 K. They found that the product channel forming allyl + Ḣ is
much  more  competitive  than  that  forming  vinyl  +  ̇
CH3  and  the
branching ratio between these two channels is approximately 0.8:0.2.
 ̇
 ̇
OH, H
O, O2  etc.
Three  radicals  can  be  formed  from  propene  after  hydrogen  atom
abstraction from three sites: the methyl site forming the resonance sta-
bilized allyl radical, the other terminal carbon site forming the vinylic
radical  and  the  central  carbon  forming  secondary  vinylic  radical.
 ̇
Hydrogen  atom  abstraction  by  radicals  of
O2  and
 ̇
O  from  the  allylic  site  inhibits  the  reactivity  of  fuel  oxidation
CH3
because those reactions consume relatively highly reactive radicals and
form the resonance stabilized allyl radical. From the BDE comparison of
the  three  C-H  bonds  in  propene,  it  is  clear  that  hydrogen  atom
abstraction from the allylic site is the most dominant and competitive
reaction channel.

Hydrogen  atom  abstraction  by

OH  radical  from  propene  has  been
extensively studied experimentally for the total rate constants, whereas
theoretical  investigations  provided  comprehensive  results  on  the  PES
[203,236,238,311-316].  The  product  channel  forming  allyl  radical  +
H2O is dominant over the other two abstraction reaction channels which
form propen-1-yl + H2O and propen-2-yl + H2O when temperature is
higher than 1000 K at 760 Torr, whilst the contribution of these three
channels  to  the  propene  oxidation  reactivity  is  quite  different.  The
channel forming allyl + H2O inhibits the reactivity through the entire
temperature range of 700–1500 K, but the other two abstraction chan-
nels  forming  propen-1-yl  and  propen-2-yl  radicals  did  not  show  any
significant  contribution  to  the  reactivity  of  propene  oxidation.  Even
though  the  branching  ratios  for  the  formation  of  propen-1-yl  and
propen-2-yl radicals are low even at high temperatures, their subsequent
reactions with molecular oxygen forming oxygen atom and the corre-
sponding radical promote the reactivity pronouncedly.

Allylic hydrogen atom abstraction by H

 ̇
O2  radical has been investi-
gated  by  Z ́ador  et  al.  [232]  who  found  that  this  reaction  channel  is
non-negligible and competes with the addition reactions. This influences

the  role  of  propene  + H

 ̇
CH3  radical  has  been
propene.  Allylic  hydrogen  atom  abstraction  by
found to play a significant role in the methane formation detected in JSR
[52].

Allylic hydrogen atom abstraction by molecular oxygen plays a sig-
nificant role in promoting the reactivity of propene oxidation at high
temperatures (e.g., T = 1250 K, p = 10 atm and φ  = 2.0) [52]. Rate
constants for this reaction channel have been studied both experimen-
tally and  theoretically in the literature.  Burke et  al. [52] gave a very
detailed  comparison  and  discussion  of  this  reaction  for  the  propene
oxidation model. Rate constants used in their model are close to the one
for toluene + O2  system. Very recently, Zhou et al. [208] performed a
very comprehensive high level ab initio study on a series of rate con-
stants of the hydrogen atom abstraction from the allylic site by molec-
ular oxygen. Their calculated rate constant for propene + O2 is in good
agreement with the experimental measurements of Stothard and Walker
[206].

C3H6 + Ḣ ⇌ Products. The addition of Ḣ atom to propene is one of the

O.  Miller  and  Klippenstein  employed  high-level
electronic structure methods to characterize the PES, RRKM theory to
calculate microcanonical E,J-resolved rate constants for the dissociation
processes, and master-equation methods to determine phenomenolog-
ical rate constants k(T,p), for all of the non-abstraction reaction. [317]
 ̈
O atom to propene is another
important  reaction  that  opens  the  double  bond  in  propene  oxidation
chemistry at high temperatures. Cavallotti and collaborators [210,211]
reported experimental/theoretical studies of this reaction by combining
crossed molecular beam mass spectrometry experiments with high-level
ab initio electronic structure calculations of the triplet and singlet po-
tential energy surfaces together with the intersystem crossing between
these two PESs and solved the RRKM/ME.

high  temperatures.  Their  subsequent  reaction  with  molecular  oxygen
can form vinoxyl radicals and oxygen atom which promote reactivity.
Detailed  investigations  on  the  kinetics  of  those  reactions  are  quite
limited and so far no theoretical or experimental results on these specific
reaction  systems  are  available.  Analogy  to  the  high-level  calculations
carried out for vinyl radical with molecular oxygen by Goldsmith et al.
[213] is normally used for the kinetics of the vinylic radicals reactions
with molecular oxygen.

radical  and  the  well  depth  for  this  radical-radical  recombination  can
(cid:0) 1  [231]. This reaction promotes the reactivity at
reach 55.2 kcal mol
low  to  intermediate  temperatures  and  can  consume  half  of  the  allyl
radicals  at  approximately  875  K  and  1  atm  [52] and  its  influence on
propene oxidation has been fully documented by Burke et al. [52]. The
PES for the radical-radical recombination reaction of allyl with hydro-
peroxyl radicals, the thermal decomposition of allyl hydroperoxide, and
the unimolecular reactions of allyloxy radical computed at a high-level
of theory was coupled with RRKM/ME calculations by Goldsmith et al.
[231] to evaluate the temperature- and pressure-dependence of the rate
constants. So far, this is the only theoretical investigation on this reac-
tion class and rate constants provided in this work have been adopted in
the propene oxidation mechanism [52] as well for butene isomers using
their analogy with propene [86–88].

hexadiene and this reaction inhibits reactivity at low and intermediate
temperatures.  Tranter  and  co-workers  [318,319]  measured  the  rate
constant  of  this  reaction  in  a  single  pulse  shock  tube  with  gas  chro-
matographic measurements at 1–10 bar and 650–1300 K. Georgievskii
et al. [320] have carried out variable reaction coordinate transition state
theory to calculate the self-recombination reaction of allyl radicals and
high  pressure  limiting  rate  constants  has  been  provided.  There  is  no
theoretical or experimental investigation on the oxidation of 1,5-hexa-
diene in the literature and the reaction class of propene oxidation can
be used as an analogy for the sub-mechanism of 1,5-hexadiene oxida-
tion, by considering the BDE difference between the primary and sec-
ondary allylic hydrogen atoms.

3.5.3. Low temperature chemistry of propene combustion

C3H6 +  ̇

OH ⇌ Products. Addition reaction of

 ̇
OH radical to the double
bond in propene is one of the major reactions in the propene oxidation
mechanism when temperature is lower than 850 K. This reaction  has
been studied extensively in the literature. From modeling development
point of view, even though the total rate constants of this reaction is
important in determining the consumption of propene at low tempera-
tures, the branching ratio between the terminal addition and the central
addition  is  more  important  in  determining  the  reactivity  of  propene
oxidation.  That  is  because  the  subsequent  reaction  channels  for  the
terminal  and  central  adducts  are  different,  with  the  terminal  adducts
preferring chain propagation reaction channels and the central adducts
favoring chain branching reaction channels. In the model development
of propene, Burke et al. [52] have taken the total addition reaction rate
 ̇
constants of
OH addition to propene the same as the one provided by the
calculated results of Z ́ador et al. [236] with branching ratio adjustment
taken into consideration to match the propene oxidation reactivity. A
 ̇
systematic investigation on the branching ratio of the
OH radical addi-
tion to the double bond along with the position change of the double
bond  will be valuable in the model development of alkenes low tem-
perature chemistry.

3.5.4. Propene combustion mechanism behavior

Homogeneous ignition delay times of propene/air have been studied
over wide ranges of temperatures and pressures of relevance to internal
combustion engines using shock tubes and RCMs. Very recently, Burke
et al. [51] carried out a series of IDT experiments in six different shock
tubes and two rapid compression machines. This is the first study of its
kind to directly compare ignition in several different shock tubes over a
wide range of conditions. The cross-comparison of shock tubes suggests
20-30% reproducibility for the IDT measurements. The combination of
shock tube and RCM data greatly expanded the data available for vali-
dation of propene oxidation models to higher pressures (2-40 atm) and
lower temperatures (750-1750 K). Moreover, species profiles from JSR
experiments obtained at near-atmospheric pressure over a temperature
range of 800–1100 K and for equivalence ratios from φ = 0.64 to 2.19
have  also  been  obtained  and  used  in  their  model  validation.  Species
profiles from two high-pressure flow reactor facilities, the VPFR (p =
6–12.5 atm, T = 843–1020 K, φ = 0.7–1.3) and HPLFR (p = 15 atm, T =
800 K, φ  = 0.35–1.25), were also measured and used for model vali-
dation. The model developed in that work captured the wide-ranging
experimental  results  quite  well.  Detailed  model  behavior  for  propene
oxidation has been documented by Burke et al. [51,52] and will not be
discussed here.

One  interesting  point  to  highlight  is  that  the  model  developed  by
Burke  et  al.  [51,52]  is  validated  above  750  K  and  there  is  no  NTC
behavior  reported  in  both  the  experimental  measurements  and  the
model prediction. However, the experimental measurements carried out
by Wilk et al. [48] in a static reactor covering lower temperatures of
530–740 K, equivalence ratios of 0.8–2.0, and a pressure of 600 Torr
show pronounced NTC behavior for propene oxidation, especially when
the equivalence ratio equals 2, as shown in Fig. 35. Heyberger et al. [49]
also observed NTC behavior of propene oxidation experimentally at ≈

initial temperature for propene oxidation. The curves represent the computed
results  using  the  detailed  mechanism  developed  by  Wilk  et  al.  [48],  and  the
symbols  represent  the  experimental  results  that  have  not  been  previ-
ously reported.

630 K in a static vessel and the mechanism developed along with their
experimental results reproduces  the NTC correctly. Even though both
groups reported the NTC behavior of propene oxidation at lower tem-
peratures, they have different explanation for this phenomenon. Wilk
et al. [48] reported that the position of the NTC region is determined by
the shift in the equilibrium of reactions involving the addition of mo-
lecular oxygen to hydrocarbon radicals, Ṙ + O2 (+M) ⇌ ṘO2 (+M), and
in  propene  oxidation,  the  most  important  hydrocarbon  radicals  that
 ̇
 ̇
participate in these reactions are
C3H5,
CO and
 ̇
CO.  The  peroxy  radicals  (ṘO2)  can  further  react  with  the  fuel
C2H3
through  H-atom  abstraction,  ṘO2+C3H6  ⇌  RO2H+  ̇
C3H5,  to  produce
O +  ̇
 ̇
hydroperoxides which thermally decompose to form R
OH resulting
in chain branching. As the temperature is raised, the equilibrium of the
Ṙ + O2 (+M) ⇌ ṘO2 (+M) reactions is shifted to the left. The overall rate
of  chain  branching  decreases  significantly  and  the  region  of  NTC
behavior is reached. The addition reaction of hydroxyl radical to pro-
pene has also been included in their mechanism followed by the first
molecular oxygen addition reaction to produce acetaldehyde via Wad-
dington  mechanism.  No  specific  reaction  accounting  for  the  NTC
behavior has been reported in that work.

Alternatively, Heyberger et al. [49] stated that at low temperatures,
the NTC is mainly due to the reversibility of the addition to oxygen of the
 ̇
adducts,
C3H6OH, which yields degenerate branching via a mechanism
similar to that of alkyl radicals and involving two oxygen additions. Few
important reactions have been proposed for the NTC behavior, including

C3H5OHOOH, and further oxygen addition to

lowed  by  isomerization/decomposition  leads  to  the  formation  of
OH
radicals and C2H4OHCOOOH, which are degenerate branching agents
and easily decompose by breaking of the O–OH bond. This is consistent
with what we found in the low temperature oxidation of butene isomers
[86–88] where the NTC behavior was attributed to the addition reaction
of hydroxyl radical to the double bond followed by first and second O2
additions leading to the chain branching reactions.

3.5.5. Chemistry difference between propene and ethylene oxidation

The important reaction classes for propene oxidation over the entire
temperature range are consistent with the ones categorized in Fig. 30,
and  those  for  ethylene  oxidation  also  fall  into  the  scheme  shown  in
Fig. 30 mainly focusing on the high temperature chemistry.

There are three major differences in the chemistry of propene and
ethylene. Firstly, the differences arise from the allylic radical chemistry.
The resonance stabilized allyl radical plays a significant role in propene
oxidation at intermediate temperatures while it is obvious that ethylene
does  not  have  that  type of  radicals  and  the  corresponding  chemistry.
Secondly, the different chemistry is from the low temperature chemistry
with propene having an NTC  behavior and ethylene not having NTC.
That is because the addition of hydroxyl radical to ethylene is followed
 ̇
by molecular oxygen addition to finally produce formaldehyde and
OH
radical through Waddington mechanism. No second molecular oxygen
addition  can happen for  the ethylene  low temperature  chemistry and
hence  no  NTC  behavior  can  be  observed  experimentally  and/or  from
simulations. Thirdly, the different chemistry can be from the addition
 ̇
 ̇
O2  radicals. For the reaction of ethylene + H
reactions of H
O2,  the for-
mation of the ethylperoxy radical is favored at low temperatures, while
at  higher  temperatures  the  hydroperoxyalkyl  and/or  oxirane  +  ̇
OH
 ̇
O2  radical adds to the
formation is faster. Alternatively, for propene, H
 ̇QOOH radical is much
 ̇QOOH radical and this
central carbon to form
more stable at higher pressures, and can thus lead to chain branching
when reacting with a second oxygen molecule.

3.6. The combustion chemistry of butene isomers

Butene isomers are known as important intermediates in the pyrol-
ysis and oxidation of high-order hydrocarbons and they are also known
as  the  shortest  alkene  with  structural  isomers  including  isobutene,  1-
butene, cis-2-butene, and trans-2-butene. Moreover, they are also key
pyrolysis  products  for  conventional  petroleum-derived  fuels  [321].
1-Butene is the smallest unsaturated hydrocarbon having a secondary
allylic  carbon  group  and  primary  carbon  groups  which  exhibit  both
alkane- and alkene-type chemistry. Understanding the oxidation chem-
istry of butene isomers is important in revealing the consumption pro-
cess of jet and rocket fuels [307,321].

The mechanism development and experimental measurements using
different  facilities  have  been  carried out  extensively  for  isobutene,  1-
and 2-butene and reported in the literature [68–88]. Detailed discussion
on the experiment and mechanism development for butene isomers has
been documented in the recent work published by Zhou et al. [88] and Li
et al. [86,87]. Therefore, here we only address the important reaction
classes and their variation with temperature according to the modeling
and experimental measurements of these three species.

Dagaut and Cathonnet [76] investigated the oxidation of isobutene
for  the  first  time  in  a  jet-stirred  reactor  at  high  temperature  (~
800–1230 K) at 1, 5 and 10 atm. They also developed a detailed kinetic
reaction  mechanism  (110  species  and  743  reactions,  most  of  them
reversible) to simulate the oxidation of isobutene in these conditions and
the ignition of isobutene-oxygen-argon mixtures in a shock tube. Their
model  predictions  showed  that  the  oxidation  of  isobutene  under  the
investigated conditions proceeds mainly through the following reaction
paths: (a) at atmospheric pressure, iC4H8 (–H) → i
CH3,
followed  by  oxidation  routes  of  these  intermediates;  and  (b)  at  high
C4H7  →  allene  +  ̇
 ̇
CH3  and  iC4H8  +  ̇
pressure,  iC4H8  (–H)  →  i
OH  →
iC4H8OH (+O2) → acetone + CH2O +  ̇
OH, followed by oxidation routes
of these intermediates.

C4H7 → allene +  ̇
 ̇

Zhao et al. [79] measured laminar flame speeds and ignition tem-
peratures in nonpremixed counterflow experiments for the butene iso-
mers at normal and elevated pressures of 2, 5 and 10 atm. Isobutene
exhibited
those  of
trans-2-butene  and  cis-2-butene  were  quite  similar  to  each  other  and
slightly  higher  than  that  of  1-butene.  These  results  showed  that  the

temperature,  while

the  highest

ignition

reactivities  of  the  butene  isomers  increase  in  the  order  of  isobutene,
2-butene, and 1-butene.

Dagaut  and  co-workers  developed  a  detailed  chemical  kinetic
mechanism (201 species involved in 1787 reactions) to reproduce the
experimental data for 1-butene [83] and 2-butene [85] obtained from a
JSR  and  a  combustion  vessel.  The  model  showed  the  importance  of
resonance stabilized radicals such as propenyl and butenyl radicals and
they also mentioned that more data would help clarifying the ignition of
1-butene  under  fuel-lean  conditions  where  the  two  reactions  C4H8-1
(+M) ⇌   ̇
 ̇
O2 influence
the modeling particularly. Moreover, the model showed that the isom-
erization  reaction  of  trans-2-butene  ⇌cis-2-butene  represents  an
important initial step of trans-2-butene oxidation.

Zhang et al. [80] studied the pyrolysis of these three butene isomers

Recently, Zhou et al. [88] and Li et al. [86,87] developed compre-
hensive chemical kinetic models for the oxidation of the three butene
isomers  and  validated  their  models  against  new  experimental  mea-
surements of ignition delay times, laminar flame speeds and literature
experimental  data  related  to  the  oxidation  of  butene  isomers.  The
mechanism [87,88] included in AramcoMech 2.0 for the oxidation of the
three butene isomers is the most comprehensive one so far and has been
extensively validated against a wide range of experimental data, hence
this mechanism is adopted in the following discussions.

with propene [202] and with further QRRK calculations to estimate the
pressure fall off. However, in order to improve the agreement with flow
reactor speciation measurements from [322], the rate constant for the
formation  of  methylallyl  radical  and  atomic  hydrogen  has  been
increased by a factor of two in the model developed by Zhou et al. [88].
Important reactions involving C–C and C–H bond breaking in 1- and
2-butene were included in the model developed by Li et al. [86,87]. The
pressure  dependent  rate  constants  for  the  C-C  bond  fission  reactions
were adapted from the study of Tsang et al [202,323]. The allylic site
C–H bond fission reaction was found to be the most favored channel, and
the  rate  constants  were  estimated  to  match  those  validated  in  the
1-butene pyrolysis experiments of Zhang et al [80].

Hydrogen atom abstraction by
For all of the hydrogen atom abstractions by different radicals from
butene isomers, we find that abstraction from the allylic site is the fastest
followed  by  the  primary  carbon  site,  with  the  vinylic  site  being  the
slowest which is in line with the C–H bond dissociation energies.

C4H7 + H

Hydrogen atom abstraction by molecular oxygen from the allylic site
in butene isomers plays an important role in determining the oxidation
reactivity  of  butene  isomers  over  the  entire  temperature  range  of
666–1650 K. In the oxidation of butene isomers, this reaction inhibits
reactivity  at  temperatures  below  900  K  and  promotes  reactivity  at
temperatures above 900 K. That is because when temperature is lower
 ̇
than 900 K, the C4H8 + O2 ⇌   ̇
O2 reaction occurs in the reverse
direction which consumes the two radicals to form two stable molecules.
When  temperature  is  higher  than  900  K,  the  reaction  happens  in  the
forward direction which consumes the two stable molecules and forms
the two radicals. H-atom abstraction from the allylic carbon site on 1-
and 2-butene results in the formation of the same products, and in this
way both 1- and 2-butene oxidation mechanisms are intrinsically linked
and a mechanism for one must contain the other. The reaction between
isobutene and molecular oxygen has been investigated in the literature
both experimentally [207] and theoretically [326]. Very recently, Zhou
et al. [208] studied the rate constants of hydrogen atom abstraction from
allylic C–H bonds by molecular oxygen from alkenes, furan, and alkyl-
benzene. Ignition delay times for 1-butene, 2-butene, isobutene, 2-meth-
ylfuran, 2,5-dimethylfuran, and toluene were increased by 50% to 2.0
times by using the new calculated rate constants provided by Zhou et al.
[208]. This work provided the first systematic study of this key initiation
reaction for compounds containing allylic hydrogen atoms.

CH3  radical  mainly  occurs  on  the
allylic site of butene isomers. This reaction producing 1- and 2-methyl-

tion from propene calculated by Miller and Klippenstein [317] using a

The  H-atom  addition  to  1-butene  is  slightly  different  from  that  in
isobutene. There are two carbon sites where the Ḣ atom can add to via
terminal and central additions. When Ḣ atom adds to the terminal car-
bon atom, the reaction through chemical activation can form propene
 ̇
CH3 which will inhibit the reactivity for the same reason as that for
and
isobutene. On the other hand, when Ḣ atom adds to the central carbon
atom,  this  will  result  in  the  formation  of  C2H4  +  ̇
C2H5,  which  will
generate two vinyl radicals and three Ḣ atoms thus ultimately promoting
reactivity. Rate constants in the model of 1- and 2-butene oxidation were

any significant sensitivity to any of the data sets presented in the model

previously either experimentally or theoretically, thus the kinetics data
used in the model need to be refined. Further investigation on this re-
action class in butene isomers oxidation under combustion conditions
will be helpful in improving the accuracy of the model.

Concentrations  of  the  vinylic  radicals  are  relatively  small  at  low
temperatures  but  increase  with  temperature.  At  high  temperatures,
vinylic radical reaction with molecular oxygen is the main pathway to
consume these radicals. The reaction can generate alkenylperoxy radi-
 ̈
cals followed by O-O bond fission resulting in the formation of
O atoms,
which pronouncedly promote reactivity. In the combustion of ethylene
[25,31,32] and propene [51,52], it was found that the vinyl, 2-propenyl

(
C3H5-t)  and  1-propenyl  (

edge,  there have  been  no previous studies on  the reactions  of  vinylic
radicals  involved  in  butene  isomers  (1-buten-2-yl,  1-buten-1-yl,
2-buten-2-yl, isobuten-1-yl) with molecular oxygen. The rate constants
of isobuten-1-yl radical with molecular oxygen have been adopted by
analogy  with  propene  [52]  in  the  mechanism.  In  1-  and  2-butene

Similar to propene oxidation where the allyl radical reaction with
hydroperoxyl  radical  plays  a  significant  role  in  determining  the  con-
sumption  of  allyl  radical  in  the  oxidation  reactivity  of  propene  at  in-
termediate  temperatures  [52],  the  reaction  of  2-methylallyl  and
hydroperoxyl radicals is observed to be very important across a range of
conditions, especially at low-to-intermediate temperatures, for butene
oxidation. A rate of production analysis shows that at approximately 730
K, 30 atm, and φ = 1.0, this reaction can consume approximately 47.1%
of all 2-methylallyl radicals. Pressure dependent rate constants for this

reaction have been taken from their analogs for the allyl + H

which  has  been  extensively  studied  by  Goldsmith  et  al.  [213].  The

both  decomposition  and  isomerization  reactions  to  produce  different

The 1-methylallyl radical can be formed by H-atom abstraction from
the secondary allylic carbon in 1-butene or the primary allylic carbon in

lecular oxygen promotes reactivity, as it consumes a stabilized allylic
radical to generate a more reactive hydroperoxy radical. This reaction
can only happen in 1- and 2-butene oxidation but not for isobutene. It is
worth noting that this is not a chemical activation but rather a direct
hydrogen abstraction reaction process. The well depth of the association

match  the  low  temperature  ignition  delay  time  measurement  in  the

determining the oxidation reactivity of butene isomers at low to inter-

branching ratio between the addition to the terminal and central car-
bon  plays  a  significant  role  in  determining the  reactivity  because the

It is worth noting that the formed adducts from the addition of
radical  to  butene  isomers  are  also  alcohol  radicals.  Hence,  the  low
temperature chemistry of butene overlaps with that of butanol oxidation
at the same temperature. This treatment captures the low temperature
reactivity  of  butene  isomers  oxidation  quite  well.  However,  further
theoretical  or  experimental  research  providing  accurate  pressure  and
temperature dependent rate constants for the first and second radical
addition to molecular oxygen will be necessary to achieve a better un-
derstanding of the low temperature chemistry of alkene oxidation.

3.6.4. Chemistry difference between butene isomers oxidation

Even with the same chemical formula, reactivity of the three butene
isomers are quite different. As shown in Fig. 41, 1-butene is the most
reactive  species  followed  by  2-butene  and  isobutene  is  the  most  un-
reactive  species  at  30  atm  for  stoichiometric  fuel/air  mixtures.  In
order to explain the differences in reactivity due to the isomeric struc-
ture, sensitivity analyses for 1-, 2-butene and isobutene oxidation have
been carried out by Li et al. [87] at identical conditions: φ = 1.0, T= 700
K, 950 K, and 1250 K, and p = 30 atm. Here, we highlight the chemistry
difference among these three species as a function of temperature.

means that this reaction inhibits the reactivity of 2-butene more than
that  for  1-butene  and  this  is  also  consistent  with  the  reactivity  com-
parison. Moreover, Ḣ atom addition to the central carbon in 1-butene

At low temperatures (< 800 K), the promoting reactions for the three
isomers  are  hydroxyl  radical  addition  to  the  C=C  double  bond.  Rate
constants for the entrance channels of the three isomers are all estimated
by analogy to the propene +  ̇
OH calculations of Z ́ador et al. [236] (with
75:25 branching ratio for terminal versus central addition for both iso-
butene and 1-butene). The total rate constant of the reaction 2-C4H8 +

 ̇QHOHOOH). This species can add to the second molecular oxygen
cals (

leading  to  the  low  temperature  chain  branching  pathways.  All  of  the
three  isomers  follow  similar  reaction  classes  shown  here  for  the  low
temperature  chemistry,  however,  because  of  the  isomeric  structural
difference between these three species, the formed products from the
branching  pathways  are  different,  ultimately  leading  to  the  different
reactivity  of  these  species.  We  found  that  the  more  branched  the
molecule is, the lower the reactivity at low temperatures. Thus, when
comparing  the  reactivity  of  1-butene  and  isobutene,  there  are  more
chain branching reactions in 1-butene than in isobutene which lead to
faster chain branching in 1-butene.

When  temperature is  higher  than 1000  K,  the  most  promoting re-
actions are H-atom abstractions by molecular oxygen from allylic carbon

et al. [73], while the rate constants of C4H8-1 + O2 and C4H8-2 + O2 are
determined  by  the  Evans-Polanyi  relationship  developed  by  Somers
et al. [335]. Rate constants for the three reactions follow the order of
C4H8-2 + O2  ≈ C4H8-1 + O2  > iC4H8  + O2  which means that this re-
action  class  in  1-  and  2-butene  promotes  the  reactivity  of  these  two
isomers  more  than  that  for  isobutene  and  this  is  consistent  with  the
reactivity  of  these  three  isomers.  Moreover,  the  subsequent  reaction

3.6.5. Chemistry difference between butene and propene oxidation

radicals.

Important reaction classes for the oxidation of propene and butene
isomers  over  the  entire  temperature  range  are  similar  and  have  been
included in Fig. 30. Reactivity difference between propene and butene
isomers originates from the rate constant differences between specific
elementary reactions and also from the different type of hydrogen atoms
involved  in  the  reactions.  Taking  propene  and  1-butene  as  examples,
even though the important reaction classes for both are the same, the
different kinetic behavior of the secondary allylic hydrogen atom in 1-
butene  and  primary  allylic  hydrogen  in  propene  makes  the  reactivity
of these two species quite different.

At  low  temperatures  (700-950K),  one  of  the  main  differences  be-
 ̇
OH
tween butene and propene oxidation is the temperature range for the
addition reaction and the subsequent first and second molecular oxygen
addition reactions. This reaction class is important for propene oxidation
when temperature is lower than 750 K. The experimental measurements
by Heyberger et al. [49] along with the model they developed predict
NTC behavior of propene oxidation at ≈ 630 K. Nevertheless, Wilk et al.
[48]  first  measured  the  NTC  behavior  of  propene  oxidation  and  also
predicted  it  by  their  model  in  the  temperature  range  of  530-740  K.
However, as discussed previously, the comprehensive model for propene
oxidation developed by Burke et al. [51,52], validated above 750 K, did
not show this NTC behavior and at this temperature range, chemistry
 ̇
shows that after
OH addition to propene, the formed adducts will react
with molecular oxygen followed by the formation of acetone, formal-
 ̇
dehyde and
OH radical via Waddington mechanism. The model does not
include the second molecular oxygen addition reactions but still predicts
the ignition delay times quite well. Hence, the low temperature chem-
istry shown in Fig. 30 is important for propene at temperatures lower
than 750 K. Alternatively, for butene isomers, the chemistry shown in
Fig. 30 is important in the temperature range of 700 - 850 K. Precise
reason for this shift is unknown so far and further theoretical work on
this topic will be helpful to understand the difference.

3.7. The combustion chemistry of pentene isomers

Combustion  chemistry  of  pentene  isomers  has  been  investigated
comprehensively in the literature [13,89-100] especially for 1-pentene,
which  is  considered  as  a  surrogate  component  of  unsaturated  hydro-
carbons in gasoline.

Minetti et al. [89] measured the pre-autoignition chemistry of 1-pen-
tene in a rapid compression at the low temperature range (600 – 900 K).
They  measured  pressure  traces,  light  emissions,  intensities  of  cool
flames,  autoignition  delays  and  hydrocarbon  conversions  before  final
ignition for both 1-pentene and n-pentane, and found that 1-pentene has
a  lower  reactivity  than  n-pentane  over  the  entire  temperature  range.
They did not develop a detailed kinetic model to explain the phenom-
enon and just proposed that by taking the higher reactivity of the allylic
 ̇
hydrogens and direct addition of
O2 radicals into account, the
classical low temperature oxidation scheme of alkanes can be applied to
1-pentene.

 ̇
OH and H

Mehl et al. [13] used the RCM experiments of Minetti et al. [89] and
new high temperature shock tube experimental results of their own to
compare ignition delay times of n-pentane and 1-pentene, concluding
that  n-pentane  is  faster  to  ignite  at  low  temperatures  because  it  has
stronger NTC behavior than 1-pentene. Mehl et al. suggested that the
C=C  double  bond  in  1-pentene  scavenges  radical  species  at  low  tem-
peratures  via  their  addition  reactions  to  the  double  bond,  thereby
delaying its ignition. Mehl et al. also discussed the implications of their
work on octane sensitivity of alkanes and alkenes, suggesting that there
are  two  major  differences  that  should  be  highlighted  between  the
oxidation chemistry of alkenes and alkanes. The first is the formation of
very stable allyl or allyl-like radicals, whilst the second relates to the
possible addition of propagating radicals, with a scavenging effect due to
the  presence  of  double  bonds.  They  found  the  allylic  radical  is  more
likely  reacting  with  molecular  oxygen  rather  with  hydroperoxyl

Ribaucour et al. [90] have studied the autoignitions of 1-pentene by
rapid  compression  machine  at  high  pressure  and  they  observed
two-stage ignition and NTC behavior for 1-pentene oxidation. They also
developed a detailed mechanism based on a common skeleton scheme to
simulate the  experimental results  including ignition  delay times, cool
flame intensities, and cyclic ether distributions. Sensitivity analysis of
the low-temperature scheme for 1-pentene showed that the total ignition
delay time is dependent on the competition between the decomposition
channels of hydroperoxyalkyl radical into the branching sequence and
into  alkenes.  The  cool  flame  delay  time  is  less  sensitive  but  depends
mainly on the decomposition rate of unsaturated ketohydroperoxides.
Their  model  behaved  well  only  when  they  (1)  included  the  addition
 ̇
O2 to the double bond and (2) if a higher
reaction channels of
rate  constant  for  the  decomposition  of  the  hydroperoxyalkyl  radicals
 ̇
into cyclic ethers was used when this radical is formed by direct H
O2
addition instead of isomerization of alkylperoxy radicals. Some of the
important  reaction  classes  were  not  included  in  the  mechanism,  for
instance, abstractions of alkylic H-atoms, isomerizations of the peroxy
radicals following successive additions of hydroxyl radicals and oxygen
molecules,  and  formations  of  unsaturated  cyclic  ethers  were  not
considered.

 ̇
OH and H

Zhong et al. [94] has developed a detailed chemical model which
includes 83 species and 560 reactions to describe 1-pentene oxidation
against  the measured  the  laminar  flame  speeds  of  1-pentene/air  mix-
tures. Alatorre et al. [96] studied a fuel-rich non-sooting 1-pentene/ox-
low  pressures  both  experimentally  and
ygen/argon  flame  at
computationally. Special emphasis was directed towards the formation
of the first aromatic ring and the further growth of small aromatic hy-
drocarbons.  By  the  reaction  flow  analysis,  they  found  that  the  major
reaction channel for benzene formation results from the recombination
of propargyl radicals.

Touchard et al. [98,99] developed a detailed kinetic mechanism for
the oxidation of 1-pentene at both high and low temperatures by using
EXGAS  system  for  the  automatic  generation  of  mechanisms.  Their
mechanism was validated against their experimental measurements of
ignition delay times from ST and RCM and speciation data from a plug
flow reactor. They also detailed the changes or additions necessary for
the  definition  of  the  specific  generic  reactions  involving  alkenes  and
their free radicals, as well as the correlations to estimate the related rate
constants. They found the addition of hydroxyl radicals to the double
bond and some specific reactivity of the allylic radical played a signifi-
cant  role  in  autoignition  delays.  The  reactions  of  allylic  and  alkenyl
radicals with O2 to produce dienes are also important in predicting the
fuel reactivity.

Very  recently,  Dong  et  al.  [100]  put  forward  a  detailed  chemical
kinetic mechanism for the oxidations of 1- and 2-pentene, which was
developed based on a published pentane mechanism [336]. The pentene
mechanism was validated against their newly measured data for 1- and
2-pentene  combustion, including  ignition delay times  in  ST and  RCM
under  engine-relevant  conditions  and  species  profiles  during  the
oxidation in JSR, as well as those experimental data from the previous
studies  [10,90,93,99].  Since  the  mechanism  is  able  to  capture  all
aforementioned experimental data quite well, both form 1- and 2-pen-
tene, flux and sensitivity analyses were performed to unravel the dif-
ferences in chemistry of the two isomers. They found that 2-pentene is in
general less reactive than 1-pentene at low to intermediate temperatures
 ̇
(650–800 K), mainly because the adducts of
OH addition reactions to
2-pentene are more likely consumed through chain-propagating rather
than chain-branching reaction pathways.

An  excellent  review  by  Westbrook  et  al.  [91]  summarized  the
detailed model development for linear hexene and pentene isomers and
highlighted  the  important  reaction  pathways  for  the  oxidation  of
2-methyl-2-butene (2M2B). A comprehensive chemical kinetic reaction
mechanism  was  developed  to  describe  the  oxidation  of  2M2B  with
particular attention on the role played by allylic C–H bonds and allylic

pentenyl radicals. Experimental measurements of ignition delay times
behind reflected shock waves in a shock tube and species mole fractions
for  fuel,  intermediate,  and  products  in  a  jet-stirred  reactor  were  also
carried out in their work for model validation. Their results showed that,
at  high  temperatures,  2M2B  reacts  rapidly,  similar  to  related  alkane
fuels, but the pronounced thermal stability of the allylic pentenyl species
inhibits  low  temperature  reactivity,  so  2M2B  does  not  produce  “cool
flames”  or  negative  temperature  coefficient  behavior.  They  also
analyzed  the  connections  between  olefin  hydrocarbon  fuels,  resulting
allylic fuel radicals, the resulting lack of low-temperature reactivity, and
the gasoline engine concept of octane sensitivity.

The  combustion  chemistry  of  1-pentene,  which  is  considered  as  a
gasoline surrogate component, has been investigated extensively in the
literature and there are very few experiments or model developments for
2-pentene. Hence, the model put forward by Westbrook et al. [91] for
2-methyl-2-butene oxidation and by Touchard et al. [98,99] for 1-pen-
tene oxidation is used in the subsequent discussion.

3.7.1. High temperature chemistry of pentene combustion

Detailed model of 1-pentene oxidation developed by Touchard et al.
[99] shows that at a high temperature of 1222 K, 1-pentene is mainly
consumed by H-abstractions reactions by hydrogen atoms and hydroxyl
radicals,  unimolecular  decomposition  giving  allyl  and  ethyl  radicals,
and  additions  of  hydrogen  atoms.  The  reactions  of  hydrogen  atom
 ̈
O atom to the C=C double bond
abstraction by O2  and the addition of
which are found to be important in the oxidation of butene isomers at
high temperatures have not been reported in their work. In the model
developed by Westbrook et al. [91] for the oxidation of 2M2B, a sensi-
tivity analysis at shock tube experimental temperatures of 1330–1730 K
does not recognize the importance of the radical addition reactions to
2M2B or to its allylic pentenyl radicals, whilst the decomposition reac-
tion  of  allylic  radicals  contributes  to  the  main  consumption  of  2M2B
during oxidation.

3.7.2. Low and intermediate temperature chemistry of pentenes combustion
It  is  interesting  to  find  that  at  low  temperatures,  both  the  auto-
ignition delay time between 600 and 900 K of 1-pentene from Ribaucour
et al. [90] and speciation measurements from a plug flow reactor be-
tween 654 and 716 K by Prabhu et al. [95] show NTC behavior. Tou-
chard et al. [98] developed a comprehensive model to try to capture the
low temperature experimental data of 1-pentene oxidation, as shown in
Fig. 42. The reaction pathway analysis of 1-pentene oxidation at 800 K
from their model shows that, apart from the Waddington mechanism,
 ̇
OH addition reaction to form the hydroxyalkyl radical followed by
the

molecular oxygen oxidation, isomerization and second O2  addition re-
actions which can ultimately form hydroxyketohydroperoxides to give
chain branching pathways, promote the reactivity at low temperatures,
as shown in Fig. 43. This is the first study in the literature clearly stating
the low temperature chain branching pathways for alkenes through the
formation of hydroxyketohydroperoxides. In addition to the formation
 ̇
of ketohydroperoxides  from
OH addition reactions, molecular  oxygen
addition to the alkenyl radical followed by isomerization and second O2
addition  can  also  produce  alkenylketohydroperoxides  promoting  the
low temperature reactivity. Even though the model does not capture the
reactivity  of  the  fuel  quite  well,  it  shows  the  importance  of  the  low
temperature chain branching reaction pathways in predicting the fuel
reactivity.  Future  theoretical  or  experimental  measurements  on  those
reactions will be valuable for improving the model prediction.

consistent with the ones mentioned above for butene isomers. It should
also be noted that at 800 K, the model predicts 14% of the allylic radicals
to react with molecular oxygen followed by isomerization and cycliza-
tion reactions to ultimately form cyclic ether. This is inconsistent with
the previous finding that the formed weak allylic C–OO bonds in allyl-
peroxy  radical  cannot  maintain  levels  high  enough  to  initiate
low-temperature chemistry and most likely dissociate back to the allylic
radical and O2.

Besides the

Westbrook  et  al.  [91]  discussed  the  important  reaction  classes  for
2-methyl-2-butene oxidation over a wide range of temperatures. They

species, unimolecular decomposition of the fuel into two radical species,

and the addition reactions, particularly, of Ḣ atoms,

It  is  worth noting  that the  produced resonantly  stabilized  radicals
have a pair of equivalent allylic species with the same thermochemistry
parameters, which should be treated as one species, but the subsequent
reactions with other molecules/radicals need to be treated separately. In
the model development, reactions initiating from the same equivalent
allylic  species  can  go  through  different  channels  to  form  different
products,  and  these  reaction  channels  compete  with  each  other.  For
example, by taking the allylic radical formed in 2M2B, the two equiv-
alent  forms,  possessing  the  same  thermochemistry  parameters,  can
produce different and quite distinct species when reacting with impor-
 ̇
tant radicals such as H
O2. Hence, the subsequent reactions for these two
species should be included in the chemical kinetic model development.
The JSR measurements carried out in the work of Westbrook et al. [91]
have distinguished the intermediate products from the different reaction
pathways of the equivalent resonantly stabilized radicals.

At  intermediate  temperatures,  the  formed  resonantly  stabilized
 ̇
radical can react with molecular oxygen to give dienes + H
O2 through
H-atom abstraction reactions, which is an important reaction pathway
for the  consumption of allylic radicals. Apart from that, the recombi-
 ̇
nation reaction between allylic radical and H
O2  radicals is also one of
the key reaction classes in determining the oxidation reactivity of pen-
 ̇
tenes.  The  formed  stable  pentenyl  hydroperoxide  species,
C5H9OOH,
decomposes by breaking the O–O bond to produce unsaturated versions
(cid:0) 1, which is
of alkoxy radicals, with an activation energy of 43 kcal mol
the same as the activation energy for the decomposition of the ketohy-
droperoxide intermediates in the low temperature chemistry for satu-
rated hydrocarbon fuels. This is a chain termination reaction pathway
when the temperature is not high enough to break the O–O bond, but
once the species reaches a temperature where the O–O bond can break
 ̇
rapidly to form
OH radical and unsaturated alkoxy radicals, then this
becomes a chain branching reaction pathway, which can promote the
oxidation  reactivity  of  pentenes.  The  unsaturated  alkoxy  radicals  can

decompose rapidly through β-scission reactions to form smaller radicals.
Westbrook  et  al.  [91]  also  investigated  the  addition  of  molecular
oxygen to the resonantly stabilized radical followed by the isomerization
and second O2  addition reaction, which represent the typical low tem-
perature  chain  branching  chemistry  for  saturated  hydrocarbon  oxida-
tion. No low temperature reactivity for 2M2B oxidation was observed
and it was proposed that the formed weak allylic C–OO bonds cannot
maintain  allylperoxy

low-temperature NTC reactivity and these radicals dissociate back to the
allylic radical and O2. This is consistent with what has been observed for

3.7.3. Chemistry difference between butene and pentene isomers

Touchard et al. [99] compared the autoignition delay time obtained
in a shock tube for 1-butene [145] and 1-pentene oxidation at the same
conditions of 1300 –  1620 K, equivalence ratio of 2.0 and initial fuel
concentration of 1%. They found that 1-pentene has a higher reactivity,
which may be due to its decomposition to ethyl radicals, and rapidly
yields  very  reactive  hydrogen  atoms,  whilst  the  decomposition  of
1-butene leads to less reactive methyl radicals. However, it should be
noted that apart from the unimolecular decomposition of the fuel mol-
 ̈
ecules directly, other reaction classes such as Ḣ and
O atoms addition to
the  double  bond,  and  their  subsequent  reactions  producing  distinct
products are also important in predicting the reactivity of the fuels in
this  temperature  range.  At  low  temperatures,  the  important  reaction
classes shown in Scheme 1 can be important for both butene and pentene
isomers. However, for the linear isomers, the difference between them
mainly  arise  from  the  difference  between  the  alkyl  group  within  the
molecule.  The  more  alkyl  group  in  the  molecule,  the  higher  of  the
reactivity. A comprehensive, adequate and comparable model for pen-
tenes  will  be  necessary  and  important  to  give  a  clear  picture  for  the
reactivity comparison with butenes.

3.7.4. Chemistry difference between pentene isomers

The combustion chemistry of 1-pentene has been studied extensively
in the literature; however, this is not so for 2-pentene. Cheng et al. [92]
measured the laminar flame speeds of three pentene isomers (1-pentene,
2-ptentene,  and  2-methyl-2-butene)  and  n-pentane  using  a  constant
volume  combustion  bomb.  A  modified  reaction  mechanism  based  on
n-pentane  oxidation  published  by  Bugler  et  al.  [336]  was  used  to
simulate  their  experimental  data.  Laminar  flame  speeds  from  the  ex-
periments  show  that  1-pentene  burns  faster  than  2-pentene  but  their
model predicts the opposite, hence the model of 2-pentene was ignored
in  their  reactivity  analysis.  Their  experiment  shows  that  the  laminar
flame  speeds  increase  in  the  order  of  2-methyl-2-butene  (2M2B),
n-pentane, 2-pentene, and 1-pentene. They proposed that the generation
and  consumption  of  the  Ḣ  atoms  is  a  key  factor  controlling  the  fuel
reactivity at high temperatures. The important reactions for 1-pentene
oxidation  included  in  their  reactivity  analysis  are  unimolecular
decomposition  and  β-scission  of  various  pentenyl  radicals.  Ḣ  atom
addition reactions to 2M2B have been included in the oxidation of 2M2B
but not for 1-pentene. Hence, a more comprehensive model which in-
 ̈
cludes the important high temperature reactions of Ḣ and
O atom ad-
ditions  is  crucial  to  have  a  concrete  explanation  of  the  differences
between pentene isomers.

As shown in Fig. 42, at low temperatures, the RCM data from Rib-
aucour et al. [90] and the flow reactor data from Prabhu et al. [95] for
1-pentene oxidation show a curvature of the low temperature reactivity
which is attributed to the formation of hydroxyketohydroperoxides, as
shown  in  detail  for  reaction  channels  RP1  and  RP2  in  Fig.  43.  The
isomerization reactions for hydroxyalkyl peroxy radicals can also occur
through  five-  and  seven-membered  ring  transition  state  structures,
which are not included in Fig. 43. Those transition states were proven to
be not dominant in the low temperature oxidation of alkanes and hence
only the reactions via six-membered ring transition states are taken into
consideration.  Even  though  there  are  no  low  temperature  reactivity
measurements or chemistry models developed for 2-pentene oxidation,
by analogy with the reaction classes occurring in the oxidation of 1-pen-
tene, we can predict that the reactivity of 2-pentene at low temperatures
will also have a similar curvature as in 1-pentene. The position of the
curvature depends on the reactivity competition between the low tem-
perature  chain  branching  reaction  pathways  and  the  Waddington
mechanism.

dict that the reactivity of 1-pentene is higher than that of 2-pentene at
low temperatures. As shown in RP1 and RP2, both of these two isom-
erization reactions occur to abstract a secondary hydrogen atom, whilst
that process in RP3 and RP4 abstracts a primary hydrogen atom whose
(cid:0) 1  higher  than  that  for  the  secondary
bond  strength  is  ~4  kcal  mol

combustion of isomers in a particular family of linear alkenes, most often
hexenes [10,98,101-109], but also including families of linear heptenes,
[103] decenes, [337] as well as methyl nonenoates [338]. Experimental
measurements  from  RCM,  JSR,  plug  flow  reactors,  shock  tubes,  and
motored engines have been used to investigate the combustion behavior
of double-bond containing long molecules. In these studies, it has been
found  that  the  isomers  where  the  C=C  double  bond  is  located  in  the
terminal carbon site (1-olefins) are the most reactive, followed by iso-
mers with the C=C double bond located at the 2-site in the carbon chain;
the C=C double bond located in the middle part of the fuel molecule
react slowest. This shows that as the C=C double bond moves toward the
center of the olefin, the low-temperature NTC behavior decreases. This is
because the strong NTC behavior in alkenes depends on the length of the

saturated  carbon  atom  chain  available  to  support  alkylperoxy  (R
radical isomerization reaction sequences, as discussed in the commonly
accepted  alkane  ignition  mechanisms  [106,339].  A  centrally  located
C=C  double  bond  interrupts  such  a  saturated  chain  and  the  addition
reaction  classes,  which  do  not  show  strong  NTC  behavior,  become
important.

Experimental studies have been carried out behind reflected shock
waves, in stirred reactors, and rapid compression machines for 1-hexene
[105,107,108]  and  for  all  three  linear  isomers  of  hexene  [101–103].
Most of these experimental studies also included either detailed kinetic
modeling or kinetics-based interpretation of their results, while others
[98,103,104] are primarily kinetic modeling studies that provide ana-
lyses of these olefin experiments.

Mehl et al. [10] investigated the autoignition behavior of pentene
and  hexene  linear  isomers  in  low  and  high  temperature  regions,  and
developed  a  wide-ranging  chemical  kinetic  model.  Their  mechanism
was  validated  against  ignition  delay  time  measured  in  a  RCM  at  low
temperatures of 630–850 K by Vanhove et al. [102], and new shock tube
experiments were performed in the work of Mehl et al. [10] to validate
the model in the temperature region of 990 – 1770 K. Reactivity changes
at  different  temperatures  for  three  hexene  isomers  were  discussed  in
their work.

Yahyaoui  et  al.  [105]  studied  the  high  temperature  oxidation  of
1-hexene in a jet-stirred reactor (JSR) between 750 and 1200 K at 10 atm
and  in  a  shock  tube  at  higher  temperatures  [105,107].  The  EXGAS
program was used to develop the detailed chemical mechanism of the
1-hexene  oxidation  and  the  modeling  results  proposed  that  at  low
temperatures,  1-hexene  is  mainly  consumed  by  retro-ene  reaction  to
give propene and, with a smaller ratio, by unimolecular decomposition
to give allyl and 1-propyl radicals. Alternatively, at high temperatures,
unimolecular  decomposition  becomes  more  important  than  the
 ̈
retro-ene reaction. No addition reactions of
O and Ḣ to the
C=C double bond were proposed to be important in their model. The
model underestimates the reactivity of 1-hexene oxidation at tempera-
tures lower than 1400 K.

An important work of Battin-Leclerc et al. [101,109] reports a study
of oxidation of the three linear isomers of hexene in a jet-stirred reactor
at temperatures ranging from 500 to 1100 K. Varying reactivity of the
three fuels with temperature was observed and discussed according to
the changes in the reaction pathways with the position of double bond.
Along  with  the  experimental  results,  comprehensive  analyses  were
carried  out  for  the  oxidation  of  three  hexene  isomers  over  different
temperature ranges and a detailed chemical kinetic model was devel-
oped  for  1-hexene  oxidation  [109].  Hence,  the  experimental  and
modeling  results  from  Battin-Leclerc  et  al.  [101,109]  at  low  to  inter-
mediate temperatures and from Mehl et al. [10] at high temperatures for
linear hexene isomers have been used in the following discussion.

3.8. The combustion chemistry of hexene isomers

3.8.1. Low and intermediate temperature chemistry of linear hexene
combustion

The concept of the “influence of the position of the double bond” in
determining  oxidation  and  ignition  of  olefins  has  been  addressed  in
several papers in the literature. These studies discuss relative rates of

The main reactions that occur during linear hexene isomers oxida-
tion  at  low  and  intermediate  temperatures  have  been  proposed  by
Battin-Leclerc et al. [101]. As discussed for other alkenes, the addition of

hydroxyl  radical  to  the  C=C  forming  hydroxylhexyl  radical  plays  a
significant  role  in  determining  the  reactivity  of  hexene  oxidation  at
lower  temperatures.  Molecular  oxygen  can  add  to  the  hydroxylhexyl
radical  to  form  hydroxyhexyl  peroxy  radical  which  can  undergo  the
Waddington mechanism to form saturated aldehydes or proceed through
the  typical  low  temperature  chain  branching  pathway  to  hydrox-
yketohydroperoxides or hydroxyl cyclic ethers. As the size of the alkene
molecule increases, the Waddington mechanism becomes less important
and the isomerization of the hydroxyhexyl peroxy radical followed by
the cyclic ether formation and low temperature chain branching reac-
tion pathways as shown in Fig. 31 becomes more important for hexenes.
As the chain of the alkene elongates, H-atom abstraction from the
alkylic hydrogens, as shown in Fig. 28, in hexene can form the alkenyl
radical. Three main reaction classes can occur with this alkenyl radical.
Firstly,  it  can  undergo  β-scission  to  form  smaller  unsaturated  hydro-
carbons and radicals; secondly, it can react with molecular oxygen to
 ̇
form H
O2 radicals and conjugated dienes through the abstraction of an
H-atom either from β position of the alkenyl radical or allylic radicals;
thirdly, it can add to molecular oxygen, followed by isomerization and
second O2 addition leading to the formation of unsaturated cyclic ethers
and  ketohydroperoxides  which  is  similar to  the  well-known  low  tem-
perature chemistry of alkanes [233].

Summarizing  the  low  temperature chemistry  of  hydrocarbons,  the
radicals  formed  in  all  cases  react  mainly  by  addition  to  an  oxygen
molecule  and  can  ultimately  form  ketohydroperoxides.  Ketohydrper-
oxides are the branching agents leading to the formation of a number of
radicals, which accumulate to the radical pool and ultimately promote
the system reactivity. In saturated hydrocarbons, the radicals can be the
fuel  radicals  directly  formed  through  H-atom  abstraction  from  fuel
molecules.  In  unsaturated  hydrocarbons,  the  radicals  can  include
 ̇
OH  radical  addition  to  the  C=C
hydroxylalkyl  radical  formed  from
double bond followed by subsequent first and second molecular oxygen
addition reactions to the formation of hydroxyketohydroperoxides ul-
timately, as shown in Fig. 31. Additionally, alkenylketohydroperoxides
can also be formed from alkenyl fuel radicals during alkene oxidation.
Therefore, the reactivity of alkenes at low temperature is controlled by
the  hydroxyketohydroperoxides  and

Even  though  the  important  reaction  classes  for  the  low  and  inter-
mediate temperature oxidation of linear hexene isomers are consistent
with what we found for butene isomers and pentene isomers, it is still
difficult to develop accurate kinetics models for hexene oxidation. The
main  problem  is  that  so  far  there  are  quite  limited  experimental  and
theoretical investigations available on the important reaction classes for
hexene  oxidation.  Taking  the  detailed  model  developed  by  Battin-
Leclerc [109] for 1-hexene oxidation as an example, rate constants for
 ̇
OH radical addition to the C=C double bond were taken
the reaction of
by analogy from the rate constants and branching ratio calculated by
Z ́ador et al. [236] on propene. The branching ratio between the terminal
and central addition plays a significant role in determining the reactivity
of hexene oxidation because the two formed hydroxyl adducts can un-
dergo different reaction pathways, which have different impacts on the
reactivity. Therefore, the branching ratio for these two channels needs to
be  thoroughly  examined.  As  the  chain  grows  longer  from  propene  to
hexene,  the  substitute  effect  should  also  be  taken  into  consideration.
Similar to the oxidation of butene isomers [87,88], this branching ratio
may need to be adjusted to 75:25 for improved prediction, hence further
theoretical analysis on this reaction needs to be carried out to provide an
accurate  branching  ratio.  Moreover,  the  secondary  allylic  hydrogen

atom in 1-hexene with the weakest C-H bond should be the easiest one to
 ̇
be abstracted by important radicals such as
OH; the branching ratio for
the formation of secondary alkenyl radical should be larger than for the
other  channels,  but  the  model  shows  that  the  formation  of  alkenyl
radicals  is  dominant  over  the  formation  of  allylic  radicals.  This  will
affect the model prediction significantly as it gives an incorrect predic-
tion  of  one  of  the  most  important  allylic  radical  formation  routes.
Therefore,  further  theoretical  studies  on  those  reaction  classes  are  of
significant  importance  for  detailed  model  development  for  larger  al-
kenes oxidation.

3.8.2. High temperature chemistry of linear hexenes combustion

Very limited kinetic models in the literature are available for hexene
isomers oxidation at high temperatures. Yahyaoui et al. [105] proposed
that  at  high  temperatures,  1-hexene  is  mainly  consumed  by  mono-
molecular initiation via C-C and C-H scissions, biomolecular initiation
involving  H-atom  abstraction  reactions  to  form  hexenyl  radicals,  and
retro-ene decomposition yielding two molecules of propene. Yang et al.
[111] mentioned that the trans-3-hexenyl radicals decompose rapidly
through β-scission reactions. Mehl et al. [10] stated that at about 1000 K,
the  reactivity  is  determined  by  the  radicals  formed  from  the  β-de-
compositions of the most abundant resonantly stabilized radicals in the
system, and the more Ḣ atoms are produced, the higher the reactivity.
When temperature is higher than 1400 K, the C–C bond fission becomes
dominant and the reactivity is again determined by the formation of Ḣ
atoms in the system. It should be noted that none of the important re-
action classes proposed in smaller alkenes of butene isomers, such as Ḣ
 ̈
O atom addition to the C=C double bond and subsequent reactions
and
were mentioned in the model development for hexene isomers. This will
severely limit the predictive capabilities of the kinetic models. Future
studies on those important reaction classes will be important to improve
the model predictions for hexene isomers.

3.8.3. Chemistry difference between linear hexene isomers

Ignition delay times of linear hexenes by Vanhove et al. [102] in an
RCM  and  from  Mehl  et  al.  [10]  in  a  shock  tube  are  shown  in  Fig.  8.
Detailed kinetic models developed by Mehl et al. [10] for hexene iso-
mers match the experimental results quite well. As can be seen at low
temperatures, 1-hexene has a strong NTC behavior which is close to the
typical  features  of  alkanes  and  it  shows  a  two-stage  ignition,  whilst
3-hexene only shows a single stage ignition and 2-hexene has an inter-
mediate behavior. Ignition delays for all three isomers became approx-
imately equal at about 850 K in the RCM measurements of Vanhove et al.
[102];  however,  the  reactivity  of  hexene  isomers  in  the  study  of
Battin-Leclerc et al. [101], shown in Fig. 44, was fastest for 1-hexene
between  500  and  700  K  but  appeared  to  converge  at  about  700  K.

version from JSR data obtained at 1.07 bar, at a residence time of 2 s, under

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience90(2022)10098345

C.-W. Zhou et al.

Battin-Leclerc et al. discussed the role of pressure on the reactivity of
hexene isomers, mentioned that the influence of pressure on the equi-
librium  of  the  addition  reactions  can  shift  the  temperature  zones  in
which some specific reactions are of importance, and explained differ-
ences in the reactivity ranking between the hexene isomers. The work of
Battin-Leclerc et al., carried out at atmospheric pressure in a JSR, is the
only study to date in which the reversal in the reactivity of the three
hexene  isomers  ordering  has  been  observed  in  a  single  family  of  ex-
periments.  The  same  reversal  from  other  experimental  measurements
was seen at much higher pressures, such as in the work by Vanhove et al.
[102],  where  it  was  beyond  not  possible  to  extend  the  reaction  tem-
perature  above  850  K  in  the  RCM.  From  the  two  experimental  in-
vestigations at different pressures, we identify the reversal of reaction
pathways  for  linear  hexene  isomers  occurring  at  about  700  K,  as
observed by Battin-Leclerc et al. [101] at atmospheric pressure and at a
higher temperature of around 850 K at 10 atm, as seen by Vanhove et al.
[102].

As discussed above, the low temperature chemistry of a fuel is mainly
determined  by  the  formation  of  ketohydroperoxides.  In  alkenes,  the
ketohydroperoxides  are  composed  of  hydroxyketohydroperoxide

OH radical addition to the C=C double bond initially, and

alkenylketohydroperoxides formed from the alkenyl radical via typical
low  temperature chemistry  of alkanes. Thus, the longer  the saturated
carbon atom chain available in alkenes, the stronger the NTC behavior,
such  as  in  1-hexene.  On  the  other  hand,  when  the  C=C  double  bond
moves from the terminal position (1-hexene) to the central one (3-hex-
formation  of  alkenylketohydroperoxides  significantly
ene),
weakens, but the low temperature chemistry of 3-hexene still shows a
weak  NTC  behavior,  which  is  from  the  formation  of  hydroxyketohy-
droperoxide through

the

When temperature is higher than 1400 K, the reactivity of 1-hexene
becomes the slowest while 2-hexene becomes the fastest and 3-hexene
lies in between. Mehl et al. [10] discussed that the important reaction
pathways  in  hexene  isomers  are  β-scissions  in  resonantly  stabilized
radicals and unimolecular decomposition through C–C bond cleavage.
Fragments leading to the formation of Ḣ atoms, such as ethyl radicals,
promote  the  high  temperature  radical  branching  more  than  methyl
radicals. Apart from those reaction pathways, the addition reactions of Ḣ
 ̈
O atoms to the C=C double bond which were crucially important for
and
smaller  alkenes  oxidation  were  not  taken  into  consideration  in  those
models, hence detailed explanation of the high temperature difference
between the three isomers needs to be revisited.

3.8.4. Chemistry difference between pentene and hexene isomers

The  important  reaction  classes  for  pentene  and  hexene  isomers
oxidation are quite similar, as shown in Fig. 30. Vanhove et al. [102]
compared the ignition delay times for 1-pentene and 1-hexene in a rapid
compression machine between 600 and 900 K and their results showed
that 1-hexene was more reactive than 1-pentene, which was consistent
with their respective octane numbers (RON = 90.9 for 1-pentene and

76.4 for 1-hexene). This inversion of relative reactivity between the two
compounds reflects important differences in the chemical mechanisms
involved in the low temperature range. As mentioned above, the low
temperature reactivity of a fuel is controlled by the formation of keto-
hydroperoxides. In addition to the reaction pathways shown in Fig. 43
for  1-pentene  that  can  also  occur  for  1-hexene  to  form  the  hydrox-
yketohydroperoxides,  the  formation  of  alkenylketohydroperoxides  in
1-hexene  also  promotes  the  low  temperature  reactivity,  which  is  un-
likely to happen for 1-pentene. As shown in Fig. 45, the formation of the
alkenylketohydroperoxides from hexenyl radical oxidation is likely to
occur and their subsequent low temperature chain branching reactions
will contribute to the reactivity of hexene oxidation.

It should be noted that the reaction pathways shown in Fig. 45 are
likely  to  occur  for  alkenyl  radicals  but  not  for  the  allylic  radicals  in
hexenes  and  higher  alkenes,  as  the  formed  C–OO  bonds  from  allylic
radicals are not strong enough to proceed to subsequent reactions and
are favored to dissociate back to the allylic radical and molecular oxy-
gen.  This  is  also  the  main  reason  which  causes  reactivity  difference
between hexenes and pentenes. As the double bond moves to the central
part of the molecule, the reactivity benefit from the formation of alke-
nylketohydroperoxides  reduces,  and  the  formation  of  hydroxyketohy-
droperoxides becomes more dominant.

3.9. The combustion chemistry of heptene isomers and higher alkenes

and

decene

[118,119]

The combustion chemistry of heptene isomers and higher alkenes (i.
e., C7 and larger) has not been studied extensively. A few studies have
been  carried  out  on  the  isomers  of  heptene  [103,112-114],  octene
[115–117],
2,4,4-trimethyl-1-pentene
[120–124], mainly in the recent 5 years. Tanaka et al. [113] measured
pressure profiles during the combustion of three linear isomers of hep-
tene in a rapid compression machine at 827 K, which showed clearly
that the reactivity of alkenes at low temperature is considerably affected
by the position of the double bond. They observed a two stage ignition in
the  oxidation  of  1-  and  2-heptene  in  RCM,  while  only  a  single  stage
ignition  was  shown  by  3-heptene.  Bounaceur  et  al.  [103]  performed
kinetic modeling analysis for the linear isomers of heptene in addition to
the  linear  isomers  of  hexene,  using  RCM  experimental  data  for  the
heptene isomers from Tanaka et al. [113]. Their model can well predict
the occurrence of cool flame for 1- and 2-heptene and the fact that such a
phenomenon is not observed for 3-heptene.

Westbrook  et  al.  [340]  carried  out  a  detailed  chemical  kinetic
modeling study on the effects of C=C double bonds on the ignition of
biodiesel fuels. Their experimental data and kinetic modeling analysis
show that the C=C double bond in biodiesel fuels have a very significant
impact on their rates of ignition that is reflected in their cetane numbers
in diesel engines. While C=C double bonds accelerate the reactivity in
the high temperature regime, the double bonds reduce the overall rate of
reaction at low temperatures, thereby reducing the CN number. This is
consistent with what we have discussed above.

C.-W. Zhou et al.

As mentioned in the previous section about the reactivity of hexene
isomers,  the  low  temperature  reactivity  of  fuels  is  determined  by  the
ability  to  form  ketohydroperoxides.  In  the  case  of  1-  and  2-heptenes,
both  hydroxyketohydro-peroxides  and  alkenylketohydroperoxides  can
be  formed  and  contribute  to  the  reactivity  of  these  two  fuels  at  low
temperatures. Similar reaction pathways can be found in Figs. 43 and 45
for  pentene  and  hexene isomers,  respectively. When  the  double bond
moves to the central part of the fuel, like in 3-heptene, the formation of
alkenylketohydroperoxides is unlikely to happen and the formation of
hydroxyketohydroperoxides is the main source of the chain branching
pathways for low temperature oxidation of 3-heptene. This is the reason
why the low temperature reactivity of 3-heptene is much lower than for
the other two isomers.

(cid:0) 1 and that for the secondary C–H bond is ~98 kcal mol

Meng et al. [117] developed a detailed model for 1-octene oxidation
based on the kinetic rules for 1-hexene by the same group [109] and
their model has been validated against the speciation results obtained in
a  JSR  over  500  to  1100  K.  Their  experimental  results  for  1-octene
oxidation show a very strong NTC behavior over the range of equiva-
lence ratios investigated when temperature is lower than 800 K, but the
model failed to capture the trends. When we have a closer look on the
rate of production of the model at 650 K, we can find that the kinetics of
few  reactions  needs  to  be  revisited  to  improve  the  model  prediction.
First,  bond  dissociation  energy  of  the  allylic  C–H  bond  is  ~87.7  kcal
(cid:0) 1, thus, the
mol
hydrogen abstraction reaction from the allylic hydrogen atom is much
favored over the other channels. In the model developed by Meng et al.,
the branching ratio of allylic radical formation is only 9.3% and that for
the secondary alkenyl radical formation is 12.0%, which is among the
reasons affecting the model prediction. Secondly, the model predicts the
formed allylic radical to react with molecular oxygen through isomeri-
zation  reactions  and  form  alkenylketohydroperoxides.  However,  from
our previous analysis of pentene and hexene oxidation, we concluded
that the C–OO bond in the allylic peroxide radical is not strong enough
to proceed along the low temperature chain branching reaction path-
ways. Thus, the alkenylketohydroperoxides cannot be formed via this
reaction pathway. Thirdly, the branching ratio of the terminal addition
 ̇
OH radical to the C=C double bond are set the
and central addition of
same in the model, which is not consistent with what we found for the
oxidation of propene [51,52] and butene isomers [86–88]. Difference in
the  branching  ratios  of  this  very  important  reactions  is  crucially
important as the subsequent reactions of the formed two hydroxyalkyl
radicals are different, which adversely affects the reactivity predicted by
the model. Fourthly, as stated above, the low temperature reactivity of
alkenes  is  controlled  by  the  formation  of  hydroxyketohydroperoxides
 ̇
OH  addition  to  the  C=C  double  bond  and  of  alke-
originating  from
nylketohydroperoxides formed through the molecular oxygen addition
to the alkenyl radical, whilst the model does not include these important
reaction classes. Those reaction classes need to be revisited to improve
the model prediction of 1-octene oxidation at low temperatures.

Hellier  et  al.  [116]  performed  engine  experiments  to  measure  the
ignition  properties  of  four  octene  isomers  to  investigate  the  effect  of
double bond position and cis versus trans conformation on diesel com-
bustion and emissions. To observe the impact of moving the position of
the  double  bond  towards  the  centre  of  the  alkyl  chain,  1-octene,
trans-2-octene, and trans-3-octene were selected. To allow a compari-
son of cis and trans isomers, cis-3-octene was also chosen. The order of
the  ignition  delay  (shortest  first)  was  found  to  be  the  following:
1-octene,  cis-3-octene,  trans-3-octene  and  trans-2-octene;  this  is  not
consistent  with  what  we  found  in  the  combustion  kinetics  of  butene,
pentene,  hexene  and  heptene  isomers  oxidation,  from  which  we
concluded that when the position of the double bond moves progres-
sively towards the centre of the molecule the ignition delay consistently
increases.  Hellier  et  al.  did  not  develop  a  detailed  kinetic  model  to
explain  the  experimental  results  and  stated  that  the  phenomena  of
cis-3-octene possessing a shorter ignition delay than trans-3-octene, and
trans-3-octene  possessing  a  shorter  ignition  delay  than  trans-2-octene,

can be attributed to the need for alkenyl and alkenyl peroxy radicals to
be  in  the  cis  arrangement  prior  to  internal  isomerization  across  the
double  bond.  This  is  not  consistent  with  what  we  found  for  the  low
temperature chemistry  of  alkene oxidation.  The alkenylketohydroper-
oxides control the low temperature reactivity for alkenes oxidation, but
their formation depends on the saturated side of the alkene, the longer
the  -CH2-CH2-CH2- group in  alkenes, the higher  the  reactivity of  that
fuel. This group cannot be formed across the C=C double bond and that
is why the shift of the C=C double to the central part of the molecule
shortens this group and hence decreases the reactivity of the fuel. The
experimental results of Hellier et al. [116] need to be revisited to give a
clearer picture of octene isomers ignition in engines.

Recently,  Fridlyand  et  al.  [118]  conducted  high  pressure,  high
temperature single pulse shock tube oxidation experiments to investi-
gate the chemical kinetics effects of the double bond position in long
chain  alkenes  including  1-decene,  cis-2-decene,  cis-5-decene,  and
trans-5-decene.  Their  experimental  measurements  of  stable  important
intermediates indicated increased reactivity for the isomers with more
centrally  located  double  bonds,  with  no  influence  from  the  cis-trans
configuration. The high temperature reactivity trend is opposite to the
low  temperature  reactivity  which  is  consistent  with  the  experimental
results for 1- and 2-heptene measured in an RCM by Wu et al. [112].
Even though RCM cannot measure the reactivity of heptene isomers at
high temperatures over 950 K, the crossing point of the reactivity for the
two isomers at 800 K and 23 bar shows that when temperature is higher,
the reactivity of 2-heptene is higher than that of 1-heptene. Fridlyand
et al. also reported the first high-temperature kinetic model for decenes,
largely capturing their high-temperature speciation measurements. Re-
action  classes  included  in  their  model  are  mainly  decomposition  of
decene isomers and fuel related allylic and alkenyl radicals. At the high
temperature, they found that the unimolecular decomposition of each
decene  fuel  molecule  and  the  rapid  decomposition  of  the  resonantly
stabilized radicals into reactive intermediates are the two most impor-
tant reaction classes. The reactivity of the decene isomers is in the order
of 5-decene igniting fastest, followed by 2-decene, with 1-decene being
the slowest to ignite.

Very  recently,  Tekawade  et  al.  [119]  examined  the  high-  and
low-temperature  reactivity  trends  of  alkenes  and  a  corresponding
n-alkane  by  studying  the  influence  of  double  bond  placement  on  the
ignition  of  C10  species  at  high-pressure  conditions.  A  combination  of
spray  and gas-phase ignition  delay studies was  performed to  produce
ignition delay data at a wide range of temperatures (650–1200 K) and
pressures (1–4 MPa). They found that at low temperatures, the order of
reactivity  is  trans-5-decene  being  the  least  reactive  (longest  ignition
delay),  followed  by  1-decene  and  n-decane  being  the  most  reactive.
However,  at  high  temperatures,  the  reactivity  trends  reverse,  with
trans-5-decene  being  the  most  reactive  and  n-decane  being  the  least
reactive, although the differences in the ignition delay at high temper-
atures are much smaller than those at low temperatures and only slightly
larger  than  the  experimental  uncertainties  (±20%),  see  Fig.  46.  This
trend is consistent with the low temperature reactivity measurements
for isomers of hexene [101,102], heptene [112], and high temperature
chemistry of decene isomers published by Fridlyand et al. [118]. The
model developed by Fridlyand et al. [118] can capture ignition delay
times from 1100 to 1200 K and the slight reactivity difference between
1-decene and trans-5-decene at these conditions. The model only con-
siders high-temperature chemistry and, therefore, does not capture the
departure  from  Arrhenius  behavior  for  temperatures  above  1055  K
where  the  intermediate  and  low  temperature  chemistry  is  important.
Based  on  the  model  developed  by  Fridlyand  et  al.,  [118],  Tekawade
et  al.  [119]  discussed  the reasons  for  the  high temperature reactivity
trend  and  they  highlighted  that  the  more  allylic  hydrogen  atoms  are
present in the molecule, the higher the reactivity, and the different in-

termediate pools (Ḣ atoms,
CH3, C2H4, C3H6, larger olefins, and reso-

Summarizing the larger alkenes discussed in this section, the shift of
the C=C double bond from terminal to the central part interrupts the
formation of a chain branching precursor of alkenylketohydroperoxides
and hence decreases the reactivity at low temperatures but accelerates
the reactivity at high temperatures.

3.10. The combustion chemistry of diolefins

Here,  we  will  discuss  the  combustion  chemistry  of  1,3-butadiene
(CH2=CHCH=CH2). With two conjugated C=C double bonds, 1,3-buta-
diene is a crucially important intermediate which can be formed during
 ̇
the combustion of olefins and larger dienes. It is a good source of
C4H5
radicals which are involved in the formation of aromatic species [341],
 ̇
C4H5
particularly  in  benzene  formation  through  the  addition  of  i-
(CH2=CH–C=CH2)  to  C2H2  [64].  Moreover,  as  the  smallest  diene,  its
detailed combustion chemistry model investigation is helpful to under-
stand the chemistry of species with two double bonds. The pyrolysis and
oxidation  mechanism  of  1,3-butadiene  has  been  studied  previously
[53–60]  with  some  works  focusing  on  the  PAH  formation  kinetics
[61–66] and the interaction chemistry when 1,3-butadiene blended with
other important fuels.

BDEs  of  the  two  C–H  bonds  in  1,3-butadiene  as  well  as  those  in
isobutene and propene were determined using the more sophisticated
QCISD(T)/CBS method, which has been employed in the 0 K formation
enthalpy calculations for 219 small molecules and radicals relevant in
combustion chemistry by Goldsmith et al. [342], in combination with
density functional M062X/6-311++G(d,p) [343] for geometry optimi-
zations. The results are shown in Fig. 48 for comparison. We can see that
BDEs  of  the  secondary  vinylic  C–H  in  the  three  species  is  within  1.7
kcal/mol, while the tertiary vinylic C–H bond in 1,3-C4H6 is 6.2 kcal/-
mol weaker than that in propene. This is because the C2–H bond in 1,

hydrogens in the molecule, the more resonance stabilized allylic radicals
will  be  formed,  and  this  inhibits  the  reactivity  of  the  fuel.  Including
 ̈
important high temperature reactions, such as addition of Ḣ and
O to the
C=C double bond and subsequent reactions, hydrogen-atom abstraction
reactions of O2 from allylic sites, and vinylic radical reactions with O2, in
the model for decene isomers will be helpful to give us a global picture of
their high temperature reactivity. As shown in Fig. 46, pressure also has a
much stronger influence on ignition delays in the NTC regime than at
high temperatures, which is due to a strong dependence of the compe-
tition  between low-  and  moderate-temperature radical branching  and
propagation on the pressure and concentration of fuel radicals.

Ignition delay times and laminar flame speeds for the oxidation of
two  diisobutylene  isomers,  2,4,4-trimethyl-1-pentene  and  2,4,4-tri-
methyl-2-pentene, which were treated as alkene components in a sur-
rogate  diesel,  have  been  investigated  in  the  literature  [120–124].
Metcalfe et al. [123] has measured ignition delay times of the two iso-
mers  behind  reflected shock  wave at 1  and 4  atm between 1200  and
1550 K with equivalence ratios ranging from 1.0 to 0.25. They found
that 2,4,4-trimethyl-2-pentene ignited significantly faster under shock
tube  conditions  than  2,4,4-trimethyl-1-pentene  and  that  the  ignition
delay times for the blend were directly dependent on the proportions of
each isomer. A comprehensive chemistry model was developed for both
isomers  which  can  capture  the  reactivity  successfully,  as  shown  in
Fig. 47.

The  trend  shown  in  Fig.  47  is  consistent  with  previous  high  tem-
perature  experimental  results  for  decene  isomers  by  Fridlyand  et  al.
[118] and Tekawade et al. [119], which reveals that at high tempera-
tures the shift of the C=C double bond to the central part of the molecule
increases the reactivity of the fuel. The model from Metcalfe et al. [123]

reviewed  comprehensively  by  both  Laskin  [54]  and  Lockhart  et  al.
[346].  Detailed  discussion  will  not  be  provided  here.  Here,  we  just
mention the very recent work carried out by Lockhart et al. [346] both
theoretically and experimentally. The measurements have been taken in
a diaphragmless shock tube, at postshock total pressures of 26–261 Torr
and temperatures ranging from 1428 to 2354 K, using laser schlieren
densitometry.

Four reaction pathways of 1,3-btadiene pyrolysis have been identi-

from 1739 to 2354 K with branching ratios ranging from 0.62 to 0.78,
with greatest yields at the lowest temperatures, independent of pressure.
Molecular  fragmentation  of  1,3-C4H6  to  C2H2  + C2H4  is  a  relatively

minor loss channel with branching fractions ranging from 0.04 to 0.15,
with greatest yields at the highest temperature independent of pressure.
Isomerization from 1,3-C4H6  to 2-C4H6  is the most significant isomeri-
zation channel with a branching fraction of 0.12 independent of tem-
perature and pressure. The contributions of direct dissociation to vinyl
radicals and H-atom elimination from the terminal carbons are negli-
gible under all experimental conditions. This finding is different from
previous results [54] which state that the initial step was the C–C bond
rupture  to  form  two  vinyl  radicals,  followed  by  the  concerted  unim-
olecular process to proceed in two steps via the formation of vinylidene;
1,3-C4H6  → C2H4  + H2CC: and H2CC: + M → C2H2  + M. A simplified
potential energy surface for the isomerization and dissociation pathways
of 1,3-C4H6 has also been given and rate constants calculations for those
reaction channels have also been presented by Lockhart et al. [346].

computations of branching ratios including inter-system crossing.

As  discussed,  BDEs  for  the  C–H  bonds  in  1,3-butadiene  are  much
higher than those in alkenes, in particular, in comparison with the allylic
C–H bond. Therefore, the addition reactions of radicals and atoms onto

3.11. Chemistry difference between alkanes and alkenes

Chemistry  differences  between  alkanes  and  alkenes  mainly  arise
from the influence of the C=C double bond on the kinetics, including
addition  reactions  to  the  double  bond  and  the  allylic  radical  related
reactions. The dominant addition reactions change with temperature. At

low temperatures,
OH radical addition to the double bond is dominant
and is followed by molecular oxygen addition reactions. At intermediate

temperatures, H

important with favored formation of a cyclic ether and

The low temperature reactivity of different types of fuels is governed
by the formation of ketohydroperoxides (KHP). In saturated hydrocar-
bons, KHP can be formed through fuel radical reacting with molecular
oxygen  followed  by  isomerization  and  second  O2  addition  reactions.
However,  KHP  formation  pathways  in  unsaturated  hydrocarbons  are
different. There are two types of KHPs that can be formed in the low

temperature oxidation of unsaturated hydrocarbons which are hydrox-
yketohydroperoxides and alkenylketohydroperoxides. The formation of
hydroxyketohydroperoxides initially starts from the molecular oxygen
addition  to  the  hydroxylalkyl  radical,  and  competes  with  the  chain
propagation  reaction  of  Waddington  mechanism.  The  formation  of
alkenylketohydroperoxides  initially  starts  from  the  molecular  oxygen
addition to alkenyl radical followed by isomerization and second mo-
lecular oxygen addition. When the number of the chain carbon atoms in
the  molecular  is  larger  than  five,  the  formation  of  alkenylketohy-
droperoxides can be competitive.

At intermediate temperatures, the allylic radical chemistry controls
the reactivity of unsaturated hydrocarbon oxidation. The dominant re-
action  pathways  are  the  radical-radical  recombination  reactions  be-
 ̇
CH3, and self-recombination reaction
tween the allylic radical and H
of  allylic radicals. These  reaction  classes are  also different from satu-
rated hydrocarbon chemistry at intermediate temperatures. In contrast,
at high temperatures, the C=C double bond will absorb the reactive Ḣ
 ̈
and
O atoms which will decrease the reactivity as compared to saturated
hydrocarbons.

4. PAH and soot formation from alkenes

kinetic modeling.

Alkenes  can  play  a  dual  role  in  PAH  growth  processes  leading
eventually to soot formation: first, they supply resonantly stabilized free
radicals (RSFR) and small stable molecules like acetylene which  then
react  to  form  monocyclic  aromatics  and  PAHs  and  second,  directly
participate in chemical reactions producing PAHs. The review below is
organized around these two roles; in the beginning, we discuss experi-
mental flame studies and corresponding chemical mechanisms deduced
from them based on the cracking patterns of the participating alkenes
and then, consider various mechanisms of PAH growth involving addi-
tions of alkenes to aryl radicals inferred either from theory or experi-
ment, or both.

4.1. Alkenes as a source of RSFR – precursors of monocyclic aromatics
and PAH

Few research groups considered PAH formation and sooting trends of
various fuels containing different alkenes in flames and tried to correlate
these  trends  with  the  structure  of  the  particular  alkenes  present.  For
instance, Dagaut and Cathonnet [76], while studying oxidation of iso-
butene in a jet-stirred reactor at combustion temperatures and pressures,
observed  the  formation  of  the  first  aromatic  ring,  benzene,  and  their
kinetic modeling identified two reactions, addition of propargyl radical
 ̇
C3H3 to allene C3H4 and recombination of two propargyl radicals, to be
responsible for this process. The same authors considered benzene for-
mation from propene [357] and concluded that the propargyl recom-
bination  is  not  important  and  propene  itself  is  not  involved  in  the
reaction pathways leading to benzene. They invoked as a possible source
recombination of two allyl radicals leading to 1,3-cyclohexadiene fol-
lowed  by its  dehydrogenation but detected a  correlation between the
concentration of 1,3-cyclohexadiene and benzene only at low fuel con-
versions. Instead, they found a good correlation of the concentrations of
cyclopentadiene and acetylene with that of benzene. Based on this they

is

C3H3  + C2H2  as  the  main
well-established  [358–360],  which  gives
product.  Most  recently,  Dagaut  and  co-workers  [83]  used  the  same
jet-stirred  reactor  technique  (but  with  more  extensive  detection  of
various molecules formed including gas chromatography and infrared
spectrometry) to investigate oxidation of 1- and 2-butene and detected
benzene, which was attributed to propargyl recombination according to

the  chemistry  of  c-

The most detailed investigation of PAH growth and soot formation in
a variety of pure 1-alkene fuels from propene to 1-octene was recently
published  by  Wang  et  al.  [361].  They  studied  counterflow  diffusion
flames at atmospheric pressure and diagnosed PAH and soot formation
employing laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) with a detection wavelength
of  500  nm  and  laser  induced-incandescence  (LII)  techniques,  respec-
tively. Based on the LIF data, the largest amount of PAH was produced in
the  1-butene  flame,  followed  by  1-pentene  and  1-hexene,  propene,
1-octene, and ethylene: 1-C4H8 > 1-C5H10 ~1-C6H12 > C3H6 > 1-C8H16
> C2H4. Interestingly, the trend for soot formation deduced from the LII
results was somewhat different: 1-C4H8 > C3H6 > 1-C5H10 > 1-C6H12 >
1-C8H16  > C2H4  (Fig. 55). In order to account for the observed trends
and to reveal the aromatic formation pathways, the authors carried out
numerical  simulations  with  a  comprehensive  chemical  kinetic  model
including PAH growth chemistry for the 1-alkene fuels.

The model used was initially based upon KAUST-Aramco PAH Mech
for  ethylene  flames,  comprising  AramcoMech  1.3
1.0  [362]
high-temperature chemistry [51,52] as the base mechanism with addi-
tional oxidation reactions for hydrocarbons up to benzene [363], PAH
growth  reaction  pathways  up  to  coronene  (A7)  from  KAUST  PAH
Mechanisms (KM1, KM2) [364,365], and the LLNL gasoline surrogate
mechanism [366] containing high-temperature submechanisms for C4
to  C7  1-alkenes.  Additionally,  the  high-temperature  combustion
sub-mechanism for 1-octene was developed by the authors using anal-
ogies to 1-alkene species in the LLNL mechanism and PAH growth re-
actions initiated by propargyl radical addition to naphthalene leading to
the formation of pyrene were included [367]. This extended mechanism
was denoted as KAUSTAramco PAH Mech 1.0-alkenes and included 575
species  and  3395  reactions.  The  results  of  modeling  showed  a  great
importance of intermediate RSFR species with odd carbon numbers in
 ̇
the  formation  of  aromatics,  in  particular  propargyl
C3H5,
 ̇
 ̇
cyclopentadienyl  c-
C5H5,  benzyl

produced from fuel decomposition. For instance, the authors compared
the  C2H4,  C3H6  and  1-C4H8  fuels  in  terms  of  the  reaction  pathways
producing the aromatic ring (benzene, A1), which in turn can grow to
larger PAH via the HACA mechanism [368,369]. Propargyl and cyclo-
pentadienyl were deduced not only be responsible for benzene forma-
tion but also to contribute significantly to the growth of larger PAHs.
Wang et al. found that the flame of the C2H4  fuel exhibits the lowest
 ̇
concentrations  of
C5H5,  orders  of  magnitude  lower  than
those with the 1-C4H8 and C3H6 fuels. In addition, the decomposition of

decomposition  of  propene.  Very  low  concentrations  of  the  C3  and  C5
RSFR in the ethylene flame lead to the very low benzene concentration.
Propargyl  and  allyl  radicals  are  particularly  important  for  benzene
formation:
C3H4(allene) +  ̇C3H3→A1 +  ̇H

(R1)

concentration is much lower. Also, the mole fraction of allyl in the 1-
C4H8 flame is about 4 times higher than that in the C3H6 flame. 1-butene
can produce allyl directly through unimolecular decomposition cleaving
the weakest C-C allylic bond:
1 (cid:0) C4H8→  ̇C3H5 +  ̇CH3

(R15)

 ̇C3H3 +  ̇C3H3→A1

C2H2 +  ̇C3H3→c (cid:0)

 ̇C5H5

C2H2 +  ̇C3H5→c (cid:0) C5H6 +  ̇H

(R2)

(R3)

(R4)

Cyclopentadiene  can  undergo  direct  H  abstraction  from  the  CH2
group forming cyclopentadienyl. Wang et al. used the following path-
ways connecting c-

 ̇
C5H5 with benzene:

c (cid:0)

 ̇C5H5 + C2H2→C6H5

 ̇CH2

C6H5

 ̇CH2 +  ̇H→C6H5CH3(toluene)

C6H5CH3 +  ̇H→A1 +  ̇CH3

(R5)

(R6)

(R7)

In  the  meantime,  it  is  well  established  now  that  benzene  can  be

readily produced via methylation of cyclopentadienyl [370–373]:

c (cid:0)

 ̇C5H5 +  ̇CH3→A1 +  ̇H +  ̇H

(R8)

One  more  pathway,  not  listed  above,  contributes  significantly  to

benzene formation in the C2H4 flame:

n (cid:0)

 ̇C4H5 + C2H2→A1 +  ̇H

(R9)

but  in  all  other  considered  flames,  the  contribution  of  R2,  i.e.,  the
recombination  of  two  propargyl  radicals,  to  benzene  formation  is
dominant. The rate of R9 is orders of magnitude slower than R2 in all
flames except the C2H4  flame, but the latter is lacking C3  species and
hence R2 is only of secondary importance in benzene formation there.
How  the  propargyl  and  allyl  radicals  are  produced  from  the  fuel
pyrolysis?  Their  formation  requires  dehydrogenation  reactions  of  C3
species or bimolecular reactions between C2 and C1 species [374,375].
Both C3 and C1 species are formed more easily in the C3H6 and 1-C4H8
 ̇
flames  than  in  the  C2H4  flame,  which  results  in  much  higher
C3H3

concentrations,  in  particular.  The  c-
contribute to the growth of larger PAH:

(R11)

(R12)

(It  should  be  noted  here  that  thermal  decomposition  of

 ̇
C10H9  to
naphthalene  + Ḣ  is  also  quite  fast  under  combustion  conditions  and
hence needs to be included in the mechanism. Theoretical rate for R10
and  R12  are  available  in  the  literature,  but  up-to-date  high-level  cal-
culations for R11 are necessary to update this mechanism).

C6H5

 ̇CH2 +  ̇C9H7(indenyl)→A4 + 2H2

(R13)

(R14)

(Here,  although  the  reaction  R14  is  included  in  the  model,  its
mechanism  is  not  well  understood  and  is  questionable.  Quantum
chemical calculations for R13 and R14 have not been reported so far and
are necessary to accurately evaluate their rate constants and to improve
this mechanism).

The C2H4  flame has the lowest PAH concentrations because it pro-
duces low concentrations of the C3  and C5  RSFR. The C3H6  flame has

similar

 ̇
C3H3  concentrations  with  the  1-C4H8  flame,  but  its  c-

 ̇
C5H5

whereas propene can form this radical via a bimolecular H abstraction
reaction:
C3H6 +  ̇H→  ̇C3H5 + H2

(R16)

and  thus  requires  Ḣ  atoms  to  be  present,  which  exhibit  high  concen-
trations  near  the  high  temperature  flame  zone.  The  allyl  radical  is
important for the formation of c-C5H5  via R4, and cyclopentadienyl in
turn  plays  a  critical  role  in  the  subsequent  PAH  through  R5(cid:0) R14.
Therefore,  the  lower  yield  of  allyl  rationalizes  the  lower  sooting  ten-
dency of C3H6 compared to 1-C4H8.

As the size of the alkene increases, the trend in the soot/PAH for-
mation  can  be  best  understood  through  the  comparison  between  1-
butene and 1-pentene, as the largest difference in the C4-C8  alkene se-
ries  was  observed  between  C4  and  C5.  Since  R2  gives  the  largest
contribution to benzene formation, the decrease in the PAH formation in
 ̇
the 1-C5H10 is attributed to a much lower concentration of
C3H3. The 1-
 ̇
C4H8  flame  produces  more
C3H3  because  the  dominant  formation
channels of propargyl in the region important for aromatic species for-
mation involve H abstraction reactions from C3H4 isomers:
C3H4(allene / propyne) +  ̇H→  ̇C3H3 + H2

(R17-R18)

While  propyne  was  found  to  be  mostly  produced  from  allene,  ac-
cording to the kinetic model, allene forms via the reaction of allyl and
methyl radicals:
 ̇C3H5 +  ̇CH3→C3H4(allene) + CH4

(R19)

In turn, the concentration profiles of methyl are highly dependent on
the fuel decomposition pattern. The rate of production analysis carried
out  by  the  authors  identified  the  following  fuel  decomposition
pathways:
1 (cid:0) C4H8→  ̇C3H5 +  ̇CH3

(R20)

1 (cid:0) C5H10→  ̇C3H5 +  ̇C2H5(→C2H4 +  ̇H)

1 (cid:0) C6H12→  ̇C3

 ̇H5 + n (cid:0)

 ̇C3H7(→C2H4 +  ̇CH3)

1-C8H16→  ̇C3H5 + 1-  ̇C5H11(→C2H4 + n-  ̇C3H7(→C2H4 +  ̇CH3))

(R21)

(R22)

(R23)

Thus,  CH3  is  produced  directly  in  the  decomposition  of  1-butene,
through  secondary  β-scission  reactions  from  1-hexene  and  1-octene,
and is not produced at all from 1-pentene. This consideration explains
 ̇
the observed ranking of
CH3 concentrations and further rationalizes the
highest concentration of benzene in 1-C4H8  flames among C4–C8  fuels.
 ̇
The only caveat here is that
CH3 concentration in the 1-octene flame is
higher  than  that in  1-pentene, but this  is  offset by  the  lower  concen-
tration of allyl in the case of C8H16.

 ̇
C3H5, C6H5

For the formation of larger aromatics, the analysis by the authors has
 ̇
CH2, and
shown an important role of R10-R14 and hence,
C2H2  are the key species. Cyclopentadienyl radical is mostly produced
by H abstraction from cyclopentadiene, whereas indenyl is formed by H
 ̇
CH2 +
abstraction form indene, which by itself is the product of the C6H5
C2H2 reaction. The 1-C4H8 flame exhibits the highest concentrations of
 ̇
 ̇
CH2, and C2H2 and, as a result, has the highest level of larger
C3H5, C6H5
PAHs.  The  propene  flame  has  a  higher  concentration  of  C2H2  as
compared  to  the  1-hexene  flame  because  H-initiated  decomposition
produces ethylene, which in turn eventually dissociated to acetylene:

C.-W. Zhou et al.

C3H6 +  ̇H→  ̇CH3 + C2H4(→  ̇C2H3(→C2H2))

(R24)

While the quantitative details of the kinetic mechanism developed by
Wang  et  al.  may  need  further  quantitative  improvements,  this  work
nicely  illuminated  the  indirect  role  of  alkenes  as  suppliers  of  RSFR,
which are the main precursors of monocyclic aromatics and PAH.

A similar main conclusion can be drawn from a series of works by
Ruwe  et  al.  who  investigated  the  PAH  growth  depending  on  the  fuel
structure using various fuels from linear alkanes to methyl substituted
alkenes. In 2016 [376], this group studied a premixed fuel-rich flame of
2-methyl-2-butene  (2M2B)  employing  flame-sampling  high-resolution
molecular-beam  mass  spectrometry  with  single-photon  ionization  via
synchrotron-generated  vacuum-ultraviolet  radiation  (MP-PIMS).  The
advantage of this modern technique is that not only masses of various
molecules and radicals can be identified but different isomers can be also
distinguished. The experiments presented by Ruwe et al. allowed for the
determination  of  isomer-resolved  species  mole  fraction  profiles  as  a
function  of  height  above  the  burner.  The  authors  first  looked  at  the
initial  fuel  consumption  pathways  and  concluded  that  they  mainly
proceed  via  H  abstraction reactions mostly at  one of the  three allylic
carbon atoms – there are totally nine allylic C-H bonds in 2M2B – and by
H addition to the double-bond. According to the experimental data, the
fuel consumption pathways, which alternate C-H or C-C β-scissions with
H abstractions on allylic carbons, eventually form the RSFR propargyl
and i-C4H5. These radicals then contribute to the formation of benzene
 ̇
C4H5 + C2H2 reactions. There are two more
via the
RSFR that are formed at the fuel consumption stage due to the branched
 ̇
structure  of  2M2B  and  the  position  of  the  double-bond,
C4H5-1
CH2–C–––

 ̇
CH2–C(CH3)= C=CH2). These species can

(R27)

The authors argue that these reactions forming toluene and o-xylene
bypass the formation benzene and support their argument by the un-
usually  high  ratio  of  the  toluene-to-benzene  concentrations  observed
experimentally. In addition to the (methyl-substituted) benzenes, Ruwe
 ̇
C4H5  + C4H4  re-
et al. also observed the formation of styrene via the i-
action  and  naphthalene  via  recombination  of  two  cyclopentadienyl
radicals. Because of the specifics of the fuel consumption, i.e., the pro-
duction of a large amount of RSFR in decomposition of 2M2B, the study
revealed an intense formation of soot precursors and PAHs.

Ruwe  et  al.  continued  investigating  the  correlation  between  the
initial fuel structure and the formation of soot precursors in 2018 [377],
when  they  studied  n-pentane,  1-pentene,  and  2M2B  flames  using  the
same  experimental  technique.  They  found  the  formation  of  PAH  in-
creases  in  the  row  n-pentane  –  1-pentene  –  2M2B  and  explored  the
chemical reasons causing this differences, which appeared to originate
from the fuel consumption patterns, i.e. from the pool of RSFR produced
when different fuels decompose. Despite that different PAH formation
trends  were  observed  from  the  three  different  fuels,  the  authors
concluded that PAH formation generally follows the same mechanism
beginning from the decomposition of fuel molecules producing a variety
of stable intermediate species including molecules and radicals, mostly
RSFR.  Although  the  decomposition  mechanisms  are  generally  similar
and  involve  repetitive  consecutive  H  abstraction  and  β-scission
elementary  steps,  the  fragmentation  products  vastly  differ  and  are
controlled by fuel-specific bond strengths, statistical probabilities, and
resonance radical stabilization. Considering these differences, one can
explain  the  difference  in  the  formation  tendency  of  typical  growth

species.  While  n-pentane  as  a  typical  n-alkane  mostly  decomposes  to
 ̇
CH3 through a string of β-scissions following the initial H
C2H4, Ḣ, and
abstraction, decomposition pathways in the 1-pentene and 2M2B flames
produce a large pool of C4  and C5  species, especially via the C4H6  and
C5H8  dienes, which in turn are traced back to the allylic radicals – the
predominant products of the initial fuel decomposition due to the fact
that allylic C-H and C-C bonds are the weakest. The 1-pentene and 2M2B
flames generate different main C5 isomers, 1,3- and 1,4-pentadienes for
1-pentene  vs.  2-methyl-1,3-butadiene  and  3-methyl-1,2-butadiene  for
2M2B. The latter flame produces significantly higher concentrations of
C4H6  and  C5H8  owing  to  the  fuel  RSFR  that  can  accumulate  in  high
concentrations and do not break to C2 and C3 species via C–C β-scission.
The different molecular structures of these small intermediates influence
the  amount  of  species  available  for  the  aromatic  growth  and  are
responsible  for  the  different  PAH  formation  trends  in  the  respective
fuels. For 2M2B, toluene can form directly via the
C3H3  (R25)
 ̇
C5H7  + C2H2  (R26)  reactions  discussed  above,  without  passing
and
through benzene. Alternatively, for the two linear fuels n-pentane and
1-pentene, toluene can form only via the addition of methyl and phenyl
 ̇
radicals, because the formation of the required
C5H7 radicals is
not favored. As a result, the concentration of toluene is much higher in
the 2M2B flame. Since toluene can significantly contribute to the for-
mation of indene and naphthalene (in particular, via the reactions of its
 ̇
benzyl radical with
C3H3 and C2H2, respectively), the 2M2B flame shows
a higher tendency to form PAHs. The authors conclude that for alkenes,
the  chemistry  of  their  allylic  fuel  radicals  and  their  decomposition
products strongly affects the initial formation reactions to the first aro-
matic ring and hence the PAH formation tendency.

In  their  latest  paper,  Ruwe  et  al.  [378]  improved  existing  kinetic
models for the decomposition of various C5  fuels followed by the for-
mation  of  PAHs  and  used  the  experimental  isomer-specific  MB-PIMS
data from this group on the pentane, 1-pentene, and 2M2B flames to
validate  their  numerical  simulations.  They  began  from  the  literature
models by Wang et al. [379] (JetSurF version 2.0) and Healy et al. [380]
developed for different fuels but including 1-pentene as an intermediate,
and by Narayanaswamy et al. [381] related to the small PAH chemistry
and containing the C0-C4  base mechanism [382]. Considering discrep-
ancies  between  experiment  and  simulations,  the  authors  developed  a
new C5  chemistry mechanism incorporating PAH formation pathways,
with  a  special  emphasis  on  the  initial  fuel  consumption  of  1-pentene
providing RSFR and the formation of small aromatics involving these
RSFR  (the  ITV  mechanism).  Overall,  the  simulations  with  the  ITV
mechanism  satisfactorily  described  the  peak  experimental  mole  frac-
tions  and  their  profile  shapes.  The  authors  reaffirmed  that  the  C5
chemistry plays an important role in the subsequent growth reactions.
They highlighted, for instance, one critical reaction channel converting
1,3-pentadiene to the cyclopentadienyl radical:
C5H8→  ̇C5H7→c (cid:0) C5H6→c (cid:0)

 ̇C5H5

(R28)

for its great importance for the formation of the aromatics. The authors
noted however that their new ITV model needs to be further improved
for reaction pathways to large PAH molecules and in terms of pressure
dependence of rate constants for most sensitive reactions, including, as
mentioned by the authors, Ḣ recombination with propargyl and Ḣ ad-
ditions to propyne or allene to propenyl isomers at various pressures,
which are important for the formation of benzene.

While relatively small alkenes considered so far maintain a similar
pattern of cracking to small species, typically to C3-C5 RSFR, C2H2, and
 ̇
CH3, followed by their reactions leading to the aromatic growth, a recent
shock-tube  and  kinetic  modeling  work  by  Brezinsky’s  and  Green’s
groups [118] on oxidation of decene isomers portrays a different picture.
According to their results, decenes are predicted to decompose only to
C6  and  then  cyclize  and  aromatize  on  their  path  to  benzene.  The
observed yield of benzene was ranked in the following order: 5-decenes
> cis-2-decene  > 1-decene  and  the  models  developed  in  the  paper

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience90(2022)10098355

C.-W. Zhou et al.

employing  the  automatic  reaction  mechanism  generator  (RMG)  were
able to account for this ranking. For all considered decenes, benzene was
shown to be mostly produced via the cyclization of a hex-2,5-dien-1-yl
followed by loss of H atoms. In the reactions of 1-decene and 2-decene,
hexadienyl radical originates from a 1,5-hexadiene and 1,4-hexadiene,
respectively,  but  the  former  is  expected  to  preferentially  dissociate
into two allyl radicals [318,319], whereas the latter is more prone to H
abstraction.  This  explains  the  larger  production  of  benzene  from
2-decene as compared to 1-decene. Additionally, for 2-decene, there is
also an extra contribution from the pathway of heptadienyl cyclization,
not available for 1-decene. For 5-decene, the hexadienyl radical formed
by cracking 1,4-nonadiene molecule, which itself is produced through
the  β-scission  of  the  dec-5-en-3-yl  radical.  Due  to  the  symmetry  of
5-decene, there are four H atoms which can be abstracted to form this
decenyl  radical,  as  compared  to  only  two  H  atoms  which  can  be
abstracted  to  form  the  appropriate  decenyl  radicals  from  1-  and
2-decenes.  The  multiple  H  abstraction  sites  and  a  small  contribution
from  cyclization  of  the  dec-5-en-1-yl  giving  cyclic  C6  and  C5  radicals
explain  the  highest  yield  of  benzene  from  5-decene  compared  to  the
other decenes. The authors noted that their proposed mechanism for the
formation of aromatics is not comprehensive but since a relatively small
amount of  benzene was  formed they did not pursue further improve-
ment  of  their  model.  Nevertheless,  this  study  provides  a  peculiar
example of the formation of an aromatic ring via cyclization of an allylic
C6 radical.

Even larger alkenes can contribute to the formation of PAH accord-
ing  Zhang  et  al.  [383]  who  reported  an  experimental  and  modeling
study on thermal tracking of n-dodecane at supercritical pressure. The
authors identified three stage of cracking: at the first one, alkanes and
alkenes were formed up to C8, at the second, alkanes and alkenes gave
rise to monocyclic aromatics and cycloalkenes, and at the third stage
designated as severe cracking PAH molecules were produced. Although
the  mechanism  used  by  the  authors  was  not  detailed  and  included
‘overall’  rather  than  elementary  reactions,  this  experiment  combined
with  crude  modeling  provided  yet  another  evidence  that  alkenes
represent  unavoidable  intermediates  on  the  path  from  saturated  hy-
drocarbons to PAHs.

Summarizing the contribution of alkenes into the formation of ben-
zene and larger PAH by the supply of RSFRs via their pyrolysis, one can
conclude that alkenes represent a ready source of such radicals, espe-
 ̇
cially  of  propargyl

 ̇
 ̇
C5H7-1, allyl
C5H5, which then recombine
 ̇
with  one  another  or  with
CH3,  or  react  with  acetylene  to  produce
(substituted) aromatic rings. The contribution of a particular alkene is
ultimately determined by the relative yield of RSFRs and C2H2 produced
in  their  decomposition  and  the  rate  of  their  formation  under  given
combustion conditions. In this view, the position of the double bond in a
linear  and  especially  in  a  branched  alkene  is  particularly  important
because  it  determines  the  number  of  the  allylic  C-C  and  C-H  bonds,
which are the weakest bonds in alkenes and hence can be cleaved more
easily and faster than any other bonds during the pyrolysis. As compared
to alkenes, the decomposition of alkanes does not form RSFRs directly.
The  main  pyrolysis  products  of  n-alkanes  typically  include  ethylene
 ̇
C2H4  and
CH3  [384,385]  and  the  former  eventually  dissociates  to
acetylene.  However,  acetylene  needs  a  RSFR  counterpart  to  form  the
first aromatic ring. The yield of higher alkenes like C3H6, 1-C4H8, etc.,
which are the RSFR precursors, is usually lower than that of C2H4. Thus,
the pathway from alkanes to benzene and PAH formation involves an
 ̇
CH3  →
extra  step  as  compared  to  alkenes:  alkanes  →  alkenes/C2H2/
 ̇
CH3 → aromatic rings, making the formation of PAHs from
RSFRs/C2H2/
alkane  fuels  slower  (and  less  competitive  with  oxidation)  than  from
alkene fuels.

4.2. Direct involvement of alkenes in PAH growth reactions

Next, we consider observed and proposed PAH growth mechanisms

where  alkenes  play  a  direct  role,  immediately  participating  in  the
elementary  reactions.  In  a  series  of  works,  Wornat  and  co-workers
considered  reaction  pathways  of  PAH  growth  in  the  supercritical  py-
rolysis  of  large  hydrocarbons,  such  as  n-decane  and  1-octene  with
various dopants, which facilitated the growth reactions. For  instance,
they  added  1-  and  2-methylnaphthalene  in  pyrolysis  of  n-decane  and
observed PAH products using high-pressure liquid chromatography with
ultraviolet–visible absorbance and mass-spectrometric detection [386].
The experiment was performed in a flow reactor at supercritical 570o C
and 94.6 atm for 133 s –  the conditions of incipient solids formation,
with a small amount of the dopants. The authors observed a large variety
of  PAHs  from  C12  to  C28,  both  purely  benzenoid  and  containing
five-member rings, and analyzed the enhancement of the peaks for in-
dividual species when either 1- or 2-methylnaphthalene were added in
separate experiments. They deduced a peculiar mechanism of the PAH
growth in their system based upon this analysis. The process begins with
facile formation of benzylic naphthylmethyl radicals and moves forward
by additions of alkene molecules. Due to the position of its methyl group,
the  growth  starting  from  2-methylnaphthyl  via  additions  of  C2H4  or
C3H6  virtually  terminates  with  the  formation  of  three-ring  PAHs,
particularly benzoindenes (from C2H4), anthracene and the very stable
phenanthrene (from C3H6) (Fig. 56 (a)). Alternatively, 1-methylnaph-
thalene  has  its  methyl  group  of  the  zigzag  edge,  adjacent  to  a  valley
carbon of the naphthalene core and hence, the reaction of ethylene (or
other  1-alkene)  with  1-naphthylmethyl  forms  the  relatively  unstable
three-ring PAH phenalene, which readily loses an H atom from the CH2
group and gives rise to phenalenyl radical (Fig. 56 (b)). Consequently,
reactions  of  arylmethyl,  phenalenyl,  and  higher-ring  number
phenalenyl-type radicals with the C2–C4  1-alkenes, together with phe-
nalenyl/arylmethyl  recombinations  can  explain  the  formation  of  the
most abundant observed four- to eight-ring benzenoid PAHs. Recombi-
nation reactions of different arylmethyl radicals and reactions of aryl-
methyl radicals with methylaromatic molecules account for most of the
remaining minor four- to seven-ring benzenoids. The authors concluded
that  the  typical  arylmethyl/alkene/phenalenyl  reaction  mechanism
displayed in Fig. 56 should be common for alkane and alkane-rich fuels
under  the  conditions  of  the  supercritical  pyrolysis  because  the  main
reactants,  1-alkenes  and  methylated  aromatics,  should  be  abundant.
Later  [387],  similar  reactions  of  resonantly-stabilized  arylmethyl
(benzylic) and phenalenyl-type radicals with C2–C4 1-alkenes were also
found to be important for the sequential PAH growth up to nine rings in
the  supercritical  pyrolysis  of  1-octene.  The  authors  inferred  that  all
necessary conditions for these reactions to occur, such as high pressure,
fuel  molecules  containing  a  weak  allylic  C–C  bond,  C2–C4  1-alkenes
originating from higher-temperature decomposition of larger n-alkanes
and  1-alkenes,  and  methylated  PAHs  that  readily  give  rise  to
resonance-stabilized  arylmethyl  and  phenalenyl-type  radicals  via
unimolecular  decomposition  or  direct  H  abstraction.  The  reaction
mechanisms of the aromatic RSFR with 1-alkenes allowed Wornat et al.
to  account  for  the  large  variety  of  PAHs  experimentally  observed  in
1-octene pyrolysis.

Wornat et al. further reinforced the role of the reactions of alkenes
with highly resonantly stabilized aromatic radicals in the PAH growth in
the supercritical pyrolysis by studying n-decane with two other dopants,
flourene and 1-methylphenanthrene [388]. These molecules were cho-
sen for two reasons, first, they represent two major three-ring products
of n-decane pyrolysis and second, they directly dissociate to two aro-
matic RSFR, 9-fluorenyl and 1-phenanthrylmethyl and eventually give
rise to two other radicals, 9-phenanthrylmethyl and fulvalenyl-like benz
[de]anthracenyl. The former stems from the fluorene dopant’s produc-
tion  of  9-methylphenanthrene  and  9-ethylphenanthrene  (Fig.  57  (a)).
The pathway to benz[de]anthracenyl is more complex and involves the
formation of four- to six-ring cata-condensed benzenoid PAH in the re-
actions with 1- and 9-phenanthrylmethyl radicals followed by their re-
action  with  ethylene.  The  four  important  RSFR  can  react  with  CH3,
principal  alkenes  (C2H4,  C3H6,  and  1-C4H8)  and  aromatic  radicals  to

carry the PAH growth forward. While the reactions of the benzylic and
fulvalenyl-like radicals followed the patterns described in the previous
work of this group (Fig. 56), Wornat et al. additionally proposed reac-
tion mechanisms for fluorenyl-like radicals. For instance, the reactions
of 9-fluorenyl radical can either preserve the five-member ring and form
substituted  fluorenes  –  fluoranthene,  3-methylfluoranthene  (Fig.  57
(b)), and several fluoranthene benzologues, or incorporate a reactant’s C
atom to expand the five-member ring of 9-fluorenyl to a six-member ring
producing phenanthrene, 9-methylphenanthrene, 9-ethylphenanthrene
(Fig. 57 (a)), and fluoranthene benzologues. Overall, the reactions of the
four  RSFR  were  hypothesized  to  be  responsible  for  the  formation  of
numerous  three-  to  seven-ring  PAHs  in  the  supercritical  pyrolysis  of
n-decane,  especially  the  fluoranthene  benzologues.  The  authors
concluded that the PAH-growth pathways deduced in their work have
widespread applicability to larger PAH.

While the mechanisms proposed by Wornat et al. may be plausible,

they still require verification through either direct experimental studies
of the proposed elementary reactions or via theoretical calculations of
the  potential  energy  surfaces  combined  with  computation  of  reaction
rate constants and product branching ratios under the conditions of the
supercritical pyrolysis. The calculations would also allow one to delin-
eate the conditions, such as temperature and pressure, under which the
proposed  mechanisms  may  be  operational.  The  idea  that  sequential
additions of alkenes to aryl radicals (or additions of alkenyl radicals to
the aromatics) lead to PAH growth can be found in the literature. For
example,  van  Spreybroeck  et  al.  reported  a  DFT  modeling  of  the
mechanism of naphthalene formation from benzene via H abstraction
followed by addition of two C2H4  molecules [389]. According to their
 ̇
C2H4
proposed mechanism, ethylene adds to phenyl producing a C6H5
radical, which in turn adds one more C2H4 unit to the side chain, then
undergoes a ring closure and an H atom loss forming benzocyclohexene
C10H12. The formation of naphthalene is then completed by sequential

abstraction of four extra H atoms in benzocyclohexene by ca.

icals. However, this mechanism does not seem plausible for a number of
reasons. First, there is a strong competition between collisional stabili-
 ̇
zation of the initial C6H5
C2H4 complex and its decomposition to styrene
+ Ḣ depending on temperature and pressure. According by earlier ki-
netic calculations by Tokmakov and Lin [390] and recent by our group
[391], the complex stabilization prevails over the formation of styrene
+ Ḣ only at relatively low temperatures and high pressures, below 1250,
1500, and ~2000 K at 1, 10, and 100 atm, respectively, based on our
results.  Thus,  unless  the  pressure  is  very  high,  the  stabilization  of
 ̇
C6H5
C2H4 and hence, addition of a second ethylene molecule, is possible
only at low combustion temperatures. Second, a removal of four H atoms
is  required  from  benzocyclohexene.  While  H  abstraction  reactions  by
 ̇
other radicals abundant in flames, e.g. Ḣ,
OH, and H losses
 ̇
C10H11  and  benzocy-
from  the  radical  intermediates  benzocyclohexyl
 ̇
clohexadienyl
C10H9 are plausible under combustion temperatures [392,
393], this requirement makes the ethylene addition mechanism clearly
inferior as compared to HACA where only one initial H abstraction from
benzene (Bittner-Howard route) or only one more intermediate one from
phenylacetylene  (Frenklach  route)  are  needed  [394].  The  potential

 ̇
CH3, and

barriers for ethylene and acetylene addition to phenyl radical are within
1.3  kcal/mol  from  one  another  and  consequently,  the  total  rate  con-
stants  for  these  reactions  at  combustion  temperatures  are  relatively
 ̇
C6H5 + C2H2 reaction being somewhat faster [390,391,
close, with the
394-398].

Shukla and Koshi [399] proposed a mechanism they called HAVA
(Hydrogen-Abstraction-Vinyl-Addition)  as  an  alternative  to  HACA
where the vinyl radical serves as the main addition reagent to benzene or
larger PAHs. This hypothesis was put forward based on their study of
gas-phase products of the pyrolysis of acetylene and ethylene using VUV
single photon ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. According to
 ̇
their mechanism,
C2H3 adds to benzene and then the reaction proceeds
to  styrene  by  the  H  loss.  Next,  H2  elimination  from  styrene  produces
phenylacetylene  and  the  reaction  sequence  continues  by  addition  of
 ̇
C2H3 unit to the ortho C atom in phenylacetylene, ring closure,
another
and  H  atom  elimination  producing  naphthalene.  A  similar  reaction
sequence  was  proposed  starting  from  naphthalene  to  form  acenaph-
thalene after first vinyl radical addition and H and H2 losses and then to

C2H3  radicals  are
eventually  produce  fluoranthene  when  two  more
added and two H atoms and one H2 molecule are eliminated. However,

CH3, and

C2H3 reaction is significantly slower than

there are several issues with the plausibility of this mechanism. First, the
 ̇
C6H6 +  ̇
C6H5 + C2H4, with the
rate constant for the former being approximately by a factor of 3.5 lower
than  that  for  the  latter  at  combustion  temperatures  [365,372,373].
Second,  molecular  hydrogen  elimination  from  alkenes  (like  styrene)
usually requires a very high barrier. For example, barriers for H2  loss
from the simplest alkene, C2H4, range from 94 to 107 kcal/mol [400]
making  this  reaction  slow  even  at  combustion  temperatures.  More
 ̇
OH
likely, under flame conditions where the radicals like Ḣ,
are plentiful, at least the first extra H atom from styrene can be removed
via  a  bimolecular  H  abstraction  reaction.  We  anticipate  that  the
requirement of two additional H atoms to be eliminated in Shukla and
Koshi’s HAVA as well as in the ethylene addition mechanism discussed
above makes these mechanisms less important than HACA. Shukla and
Koshi  argued  their  case  for  HAVA  based  on  the  observation  of  more
aromatic  species  including  PAHs,  with  higher  concentrations  in  the
ethylene pyrolysis as compared to the acetylene pyrolysis. However, this
argument does not take into account the fact that pyrolysis of alkenes
produces RSFR, which greatly contribute to the PAH growth as shown by
Wang et al. [361] and Ruwe et al. [376–378] and discussed above. For
example, for ethylene, Shukla and Koshi themselves noted the impor-
tance of the
C3H3 reaction producing the prop-
argyl  radical  –  a  precursor  of  benzene  and  phenyl  radical.  Although
further kinetic modeling taking into account the vinyl radical addition
pathways may be needed, it is unlikely that the mechanism proposed by
Shukla and Koshi would be competitive with HACA.

Theoretical  calculations  by  Mebel’s  group  together  with  experi-
mental studies of the elementary reaction mechanisms in crossed mo-
lecular  beams  and  in  high  temperature  chemical  reactors  provided
evidence that alkenes and dienes may indeed directly participate in the
PAH growth reactions. Two experimental groups explored the reaction
of  the  phenyl  radical  with  propene  in  crossed  beams.  Kaiser  and  co-
workers conducted their experiment [401] at collision energies of ~45
(cid:0) 1  and identified the formation of styrene via methyl loss from

C9H11  intermediates  and  of  3-phenylpropene  (C6H5CH2C2H3)  and
1-phenylpropene (CH3CHCHC6H5) via H loss channels (Fig. 58). Frac-
tions of the methyl vs. hydrogen loss channels of 68±16% : 32±10%
derived  experimentally  were  corroborated  by  theoretical  calculations

using energy-dependent RRKM theory, which clearly demonstrated that
3-phenylpropene is the predominant H loss product. According to the
(cid:0) 1 results in a
RRKM results, an increase of collision energy to 200 kJ mol
sharp decrease of the contribution of the methyl loss channel to ~25%;
the  decreased  importance  of  the  methyl  group  loss  channel  was  also
demonstrated experimentally at elevated collision energies of 130–193
(cid:0) 1  [402].  Davis  and  co-workers  found  a  similar  trend  of  a
kJ  mol
decrease of the methyl loss branching ratio with collision energy, but
their experiments gave a higher yield of styrene +  ̇
CH3  [403]. Kislov
et al. [404] reported RRKM/ME calculations of the reaction rate con-
stants  and  product  branching  ratios  at  different  temperatures  and

pressures  and  showed  that  under  combustion  conditions  the
C3H6 reaction mostly forms benzene + allyl radical via the H abstraction
channel  followed  by  styrene  plus  methyl  and  3-phenylpropene  + Ḣ.
Experiments  in  a  high-temperature  chemical  microreactor  by  Zhang
et al. at 1200-1500 K confirmed the formation of styrene +  ̇
CH3 as well
as  3-phenylpropene  as  the  dominant  H  loss  product  [405].  A  recent
flow-reactor study by Green’s group [406] employing flash photolysis
combined  with  time-resolved  molecular  beam  mass  spectrometry
(MBMS)  and  visible  laser  absorbance  detected  five  major  product
 ̇
C6H5  + C3H6  at 600 and 700 K, H abstraction producing
channels of
benzene, CH3 loss forming styrene, H-loss giving phenylpropene isomers
(although  those  were  not  distinguished),  radical  adduct  stabilization,
and a new unexpected channel forming benzyl radical + C2H4. While the
formation of RSFR like allyl and benzyl as well as styrene, which may
form  styrenyl  and  ortho-vinylphenyl  radicals  by  H  abstraction,  can
contribute to the PAH growth via various mechanisms, the formation of
3-phenylpropene  is  of  special  significance.  The calculations  by  Kislov
et  al.  [404]  showed  that  an  H  atom  from  the  side-chain  CH2  group
(Fig. 58) can be preferably and easily abstracted forming a resonantly
stabilized  1-phenylallyl  radical;  the  computed  barrier  for  the  H
abstraction by an Ḣ atom is only ~5 kcal/mol. Next, 1-phenylallyl un-
dergoes a facile ring closure and eliminates an H atom producing indene.
RRKM/ME  calculations  of  the  rate  constant  for  the  1-phenylallyl  →

indene  + Ḣ  reaction  gave  values  from  6×103  to  2×107  s
1000-2250 K temperature range at 1 atm [407]. Thus, the addition of
propene to phenyl can lead to indene in the series of three consecutive
reactions. Similarly, one can expect that the addition of propene to an

aryl radical can lead to a growth of PAH by an extra five-member ring.
The simplest diene – 1,3-butadiene C4H6, has been shown to directly
partake in the PAH growth in combined experimental and theoretical
studies addressing the reaction mechanism of 1,3-butadiene addition to
phenyl and 1-naphthyl radicals. For instance, the crossed beam reaction
of the phenyl radical with 1,3-butadiene was carried out under single
(cid:0) 1  and the
collision conditions at collision energies of about 55 kJ mol
bicyclic  1,4-dihydronaphthalene  molecule  was  experimentally  identi-
fied  as  a  major  reaction  product  (58±15%)  with  the  1-phenyl–1,3-
butadiene  contributing  34±10%  [408].  Ab  initio  calculations  of  the
potential energy surface showed the reaction to be initiated by a bar-
rierless addition of the phenyl radical to the terminal carbon atom of the
 ̇
C10H11  intermediate;  the  latter  un-
1,3-butadiene  to  form  a  bound
dergoes an H atom elimination from the terminal CH2 group of 1,3-buta-
diene  leading  to  1-phenyl-trans-1,3-butadiene.  Alternatively,  the
dominant product, 1,4-dihydronaphthalene, is formed via an isomeri-
zation of  the adduct by ring closure  and elimination of the hydrogen
atom from the phenyl moiety at the bridging carbon atom (Fig. 58 (b)).
Interestingly, the de facto barrierless formation of the 1,4-dihydronaph-
 ̇
thalene  molecule  involving  a  single  collision  between
C6H5  and  1,
3-C4H6 can represent an important step in the PAH growth not only at
high temperatures in combustion but also at low or very low tempera-
tures  characteristic  for  interstellar  chemistry.  The  same  reaction  was
also  explored
in  a  high  temperature  chemical  reactor  under
combustion-like conditions at 873 K, where the reaction products were
probed utilizing MB-PIMS with VUV radiation from the Advanced Light
Source [409]. The authors detected C10H10, C9H8, and C8H8 molecular
products  and  assigned  C10H10  isomers  as  1-phenyl-1,3-butadiene,  1,
4-dihydronaphthalene,  1-methylindene,  C9H8  isomers  as  indene,  phe-
nylallene, 1-phenyl-1-methylacetylene, and a C8H8 isomer as styrene. By
comparing these observations with the crossed molecular beam study
and with the computed potential energy surface they identified 1-phe-
nyl–1,3-butadiene, 1,4-dihydronaphthalene, and styrene as the primary
reaction  products  between  the  phenyl  radical  and  1,3-butadiene.  The
other molecules observed in this experiment were assigned as products
of secondary reactions. The generality of the butadiene addition mech-
anism was reinforced by another crossed beams study of the reaction of
1-naphthyl radical with 1,3-butadiene [410]. This experiment showed
prevailing  formation  of  1,4-dihydrophenanthrene  and  the  calculated
potential  energy  surface  revealed  a  similar  mechanism  in  which  1,
3-C4H6 adds to the 1-naphthyl radical via a submerged barrier following
the formation of a van der Waals complex and then ring closure occurs
producing the third six-member ring and an H loss completes the reac-
tion.  Thus,  the  addition  of  1,3-butadiene  to  an  aryl  radical  was
concluded to be a facile pathway to the formation of a dihydrogenated
PAH with an extra six-member ring, which can aromatized by removal
of two extra hydrogen atoms.

In  summary,  alkenes  can  directly  contribute  to  the  PAH  growth
through reactions of aryl radicals with propene C3H6 and 1,3-butadiene
C4H6  forming  an  extra  five-  and  six-membered  ring,  respectively,  as
directly confirmed experimentally and by theoretical calculations. Also,
reactions  of  highly  resonantly  stabilized  aromatic  radicals,  such  as
arylmethyl, phenalenyl, fluorenyl and their higher-ring number analogs
with  the  C2–C4  1-alkenes,  were  deduced  (from  experimental  observa-
tions)  to play  a  significant role  in the  PAH  growth. However,  further
theoretical  calculations  of  the  reaction  rate  constants  and  kinetic
modeling are required to evaluate the particular contributions of these
mechanisms depending on the fuel type and combustion conditions.

4.3. Alkenes and flame sooting tendences

In their work, Wang et al. [361] compared PAH and soot formation in
different pure alkene flames from propene to 1-octene and, surprisingly,
found  that  the  trend  in  soot  formation,  1-C4H8  > C3H6  > 1-C5H10  >
1-C6H12  > 1-C8H16  > C2H4,  did  not  exactly  reproduce  that  for  PAH,
1-C4H8 > 1-C5H10 ~1-C6H12 > C3H6 > 1-C8H16 > C2H4. A peculiar result

is that while the 1-C6H12 flame showed a higher tendency to form PAHs,
it produced less soot than the C3H6  flame. Wang et al. attributed this
observation to the role of acetylene in the soot growth via the HACA
mechanism after the nucleation of incipient particle from PAHs [368,
369].  However,  overall  the  study  has  shown  that  it  is  not  valid  to
evaluate sooting tendency only based upon C2H2 concentration, as was
done  in  earlier  soot  models  that  treated  C2H2  as  one  and  only  soot
precursor  [411].  The  C2H4  flame  has  the  highest  C2H2  concentration
among all the considered 1-alkene flames but produced the soot volume
fraction of at least an order of magnitude lower compared to the other
fuels.  The  main  conclusion  of  the  work  is  that  PAH  and  sooting  ten-
dencies are mostly determined by the levels of RSFR, especially, prop-
argyl, allyl, cyclopentadienyl, benzyl, and indenyl, as well as of methyl
and acetylene formed via fuel decomposition reactions. The differences
in the concentrations of RSFR, which are determined by the decompo-
sition pattern of the parent fuel molecules, in particular alkenes, appears
to  be  responsible  for  the  differences  in  soot  and  PAH  formation
tendencies.

5. Conclusions and research outlook

This review has assessed the recent progress in gas-phase detailed
kinetic  model  development  for  species  with  C=C  double  bond.  This
compiled knowledge of alkene combustion chemistry would be highly
useful for a better understanding of the number and the position of the
C=C  double  bond  on  the  oxidation  and  pyrolysis  characteristics  of
olefinic species. Engine-relevant combustion features were analyzed by
the fundamental combustion experiments carried out in different facil-
ities,  including  STs  and  RCMs  to  measuring  IDTs,  flame  burners  to
measuring laminar flame speeds, and JSRs and FRs to measure specia-
tion data.

This  manuscript  highlighted  the  progress  made  towards  under-
standing  detailed  chemistry  for  the  low-,  intermediate-  and  high-
temperature  alkene  oxidation.  With  the  availability  of  new  experi-
mental data and new theoretical insights, it is now possible to develop
and  assess  semi-predictive  models  for  alkene  fuels.  In  addition,  the
detailed  understanding  of  alkene  combustion  chemistry  presented  in
this article provides a fundamental explanation of the reactivity of fuels
when  C=C  double  bond  is  present  within  the  molecule.  In  summary,
 ̈
C=C will interact with important radicals like
O etc., in
different ways over different temperature ranges. Moreover, the easily
formed  unreactive  resonance  stabilized  allylic  radical  inhibits  the
reactivity  of  unsaturated  hydrocarbons.  The  more  allylic  hydrogen
atoms in the molecule, the less reactive the fuel is. This is also the main
reason of the difference of reactivity between alkenes and alkanes.

Key  points  and  features  of  the  combustion  chemistry  of  alkenes
derived  from  careful  analyses  of  a  number  of  current  state-of-the-art
detailed  kinetic  mechanisms,  as  well  as  prospects  for  future  experi-
mental and theoretical studies are summarized as follows:

(1)  At low temperatures (600–850 K), the reactivity of different type
of fuels is determined by the formation of KHP. Two types of KHP,
including  hydroxyketohydroperoxides  and  alkenylketohy-
droperoxides, can be formed in the oxidation of unsaturated hy-
drocarbons.  The
formation  of  hydroxyketohydroperoxides
initially  starts  from  the  molecular  oxygen  addition  to  the
hydroxylalkyl radical, and competes with the chain propagation
reaction through Waddington mechanism. When the chain car-
bon number of the molecule is larger than three, the formation of
hydroxyketohydroperoxides could be competitive. The formation
of alkenylketohydroperoxides initially starts from the molecular
oxygen  addition  to  alkenyl  radicals  followed  by  isomerization
and second molecular oxygen addition. When the number of the
chain carbon atoms in the molecule is larger than five, the for-
mation  of  alkenylketohydroperoxides  can  be  competitive.
Further  refinements  of  the  rate  constants  for  important  low-

 ̇
temperature  reaction  classes,  especially
OH  adding  to  and
abstracting H-atom from alkenes, and first and second O2 addi-
tion reactions to hydroxyalkyl (ṘOH) or alkenyl (ṘAEN) radicals,
are recommended. Since the available rate constants for butene
and  higher  species  for  these  reaction  classes  are  scarce,  either
calculated  or  measured  kinetics  data  would  be  valuable  and  is
expected  to  improve  model  predictions  at  low  temperature
regimes.

(2)  At intermediate temperatures (850–1200 K), resonance stabilized
allylic  radical  chemistry  is  important  in  determining  the  reac-
tivity  of  the  unsaturated  hydrocarbons.  The  radical-radical
recombination and the subsequent decomposition reaction clas-
ses should be taken into consideration when developing the ki-
netic models for these molecules. Specifically, the recombination
between allylic radicals themselves and their recombination with
 ̇
 ̇
important  radicals  such  as  H
O2,
CH3,  and  the  subsequent  re-
actions  need  to  be  paid  special  attention  to.  When  the  carbon
number of the olefin is larger, alkenyl radical chemistry is also
important;  for  example,  its  reaction  with  molecular  oxygen  to
 ̇
O2 radical is important in promoting the reac-
form diene and H
 ̇
tivity at intermediate temperatures. Apart from that, H
O2 radical
addition to the double bond in alkenes is also important in fuel
 ̇
consumption  with  favored  formation  of  a  cyclic  ether  and
OH
radical. We recommend further investigations to be conducted on
the  kinetics  of  the  aforementioned  important  intermediate-
 ̇
O2 addition reactions to
temperature reaction classes, namely, H
 ̇
allylic radicals (ṘA), ṘA  recombination reactions and H
O2  addi-
tion reactions to alkenes. Special emphasis is placed on C4 and
higher  species,  for  which  available  rate  constants  are  quite
limited.

(3)  At high temperatures (>1200 K), additions of Ḣ and

 ̇
OH,

 ̈
O, Ḣ, and

 ̈
O atom to the
double bond are important reaction classes to open the double
bond. Apart from the addition reactions, pyrolysis of fuel mole-
cules becomes important when  temperature increases. The for-
mation  of  vinylic  radicals  through  H-atom  abstraction  by
 ̇
important radicals such as
CH3 is competitive when
temperature  increases.  Vinylic  radicals  can  further  react  with
 ̈
molecular oxygen to form oxygenated radicals and
O atom, which
is a very important chain branching reaction pathway to promote
the reactivity of unsaturated hydrocarbons at high temperatures.
Given that few kinetics data for the important high-temperature
reaction  classes  highlighted  here,  viz.  Ḣ  addition  reactions  to
 ̈
alkenes,
O  addition  reactions  to  alkenes  and  O2  addition  re-
actions  to vinylic radicals (ṘVT/ṘVS), is  available for butene or
larger alkenes, further theoretical or experimental investigations
on  the  rate  constants  of  these  reactions  will  be  helpful  in
improving the accuracy of the kinetic models.

(4) Undoubtedly, there is a large demand for elementary kinetic in-
vestigations on key reactions involved in alkene chemistry from
low to high temperatures, both theoretically and experimentally.
Experimental rate coefficient measurements at combustion rele-
vant temperatures (600 –  2000 K) are needed to ensure the ac-
curacy  of  the  reaction  kinetics  data  used  in  chemical  kinetic
models. As discussed in this paper, theoretical estimates/analogy
of  some  reaction  rate  constants  can  be  adopted  to  develop
chemical  kinetic  models,  but  theoretical  calculations  for  these
reactions  are  needed  to  provide  improved  model  predictions.
Theoretical studies exploring reaction pathways and generating
reliable  potential  energy  surfaces  is  a  very  valuable  tool  to
identify  the  importance  of  the  reaction  classes  over  different
temperature ranges. Moreover, based on the PES, we may solve
RRKM/ME  to  obtain  accurate  temperature-  and  pressure-
dependent rate constants which can be used in chemical kinetic
model  development.  As  implied  in  Sections  2  and  3,  compre-
hensive  kinetic  modeling  studies  of  the  oxidation  of  C5  and
higher  alkenes  are  scarce,  due  in  part  to  the  lack  of  available

accurate  rate  constants  for  C4  and  higher  species.  In  addition,
extensive  experiments  on  the  global  combustion  properties  as
well as speciation of C5 and higher alkenes will be valuable in
aiding the development and validation of comprehensive chem-
ical kinetic models.
