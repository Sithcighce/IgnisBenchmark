    "question_text": "Explain the phase-mineral transformation mechanisms during biomass combustion from 200°C to 1500°C, and how these transformations affect the final ash properties and potential applications.",
    "standard_answer": "Biomass ash undergoes complex phase-mineral transformations during combustion across the temperature range of 200°C to 1500°C, following a sequential mechanism that determines the final ash characteristics. The process begins with organic material combustion between 200°C and 850°C, where volatile components are released and carbonaceous structures decompose. At approximately 500°C, particle fragmentation occurs, increasing surface area for subsequent reactions. Between 700°C and 1300°C, agglomeration and particle growth take place as intermediate phases form, including chlorides, hydroxides, carbonates, sulfates, and phosphates from the original biomass inorganic constituents. Initial fusion begins around 700°C, with extensive fusion occurring between 900°C and 1100°C, and complete fusion above 1100°C. New-phase crystallization occurs throughout 500°C-1500°C as thermodynamically stable minerals form, while melt glass formation dominates between 700°C and 1500°C due to rapid cooling of fused inorganic material. These transformations create a final ash composition rich in silicates, oxides, glass phases, and various salts. The temperature-dependent transformations critically affect ash properties: higher temperatures promote glass formation and reduce unburned carbon, improving pozzolanic activity but potentially increasing the volatility of toxic elements. The specific transformation pathway depends on biomass composition, particularly the ratios of Si, K, Ca, and P, which influence fusion temperatures and mineral speciation. These mechanisms ultimately determine whether the ash is suitable for construction applications, soil amendment, or requires further processing for safe utilization.",

    "question_text": "How does combustion temperature influence the volatilization-condensation behavior of different trace element groups in coal fly ash, and what are the resulting enrichment patterns in particle size fractions?",
    "standard_answer": "Combustion temperature critically affects the volatilization-condensation behavior of trace elements in coal fly ash through thermally-driven phase transformations. The volatilization-condensation theory distinguishes three groups of elements with distinct behaviors: Group I elements (Al, Ca, Fe, K, Mg, Na, and Ti), classified as 'lithophiles', show little or no enrichment in smaller fly ash particles due to their lower volatility and refractory nature. Group II elements (As, Cd, Mu, Pb, Sb, and Se), defined as 'chalcophiles', display increasing concentration with decreasing particle size because they volatilize more readily at high combustion temperatures and subsequently condense on the surfaces of finer particles during flue gas cooling. Group III elements (Be, Cu, Ni, V, and Co) exhibit intermediate behavior, being enriched in smaller particles but to a lesser extent than elements in Group II. Higher combustion temperatures increase the extent of volatilization of mineral elements, thereby changing the characteristics of the ash produced. The finer fly ash fractions become enriched in glass, whereas minerals such as mullite, quartz, and lime characterize coarser fractions, creating a particle-size-dependent distribution of elements governed by temperature-dependent volatilization and condensation kinetics.",

    "question_text": "Explain how combustion temperature affects the volatilization-condensation mechanism of trace elements in coal fly ash formation, and analyze how this mechanism influences the distribution of Group II elements across different particle sizes according to the provided paper.",
    "standard_answer": "Combustion temperature plays a critical role in the volatilization-condensation mechanism during coal fly ash formation. At high combustion temperatures (typically between 400°C and 1500°C), mineral elements undergo phase transformations where certain elements volatilize and subsequently condense onto finer fly ash particles as the flue gases cool. This mechanism creates distinct enrichment patterns based on element classification. According to the volatilization-condensation theory, Group II elements (As, Cd, Mu, Pb, Sb, and Se), defined as 'chalcophiles', display increasing concentration with decreasing particle size due to their volatilization behavior at combustion temperatures and subsequent condensation onto the surfaces of smaller fly ash particles. In contrast, Group I elements (Al, Ca, Fe, K, Mg, Na, and Ti), classified as 'lithophiles', show little or no enrichment in smaller particles, while Group III elements (Be, Cu, Ni, V, and Co) exhibit intermediate behavior with some enrichment in smaller particles but to a lesser extent than Group II elements. The combustion temperature directly affects the extent of mineral element volatilization, with higher temperatures promoting greater enrichment of these volatile elements on smaller particles through this condensation mechanism.",
