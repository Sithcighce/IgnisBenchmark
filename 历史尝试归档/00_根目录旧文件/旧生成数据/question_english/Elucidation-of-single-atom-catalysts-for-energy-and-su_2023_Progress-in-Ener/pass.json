    "question_text": "Why do single atom catalysts (SACs) exhibit higher selectivity in hydrogenation reactions compared to nanoparticle catalysts, and how does atomic dispersion influence reaction pathways?",
    "standard_answer": "Single atom catalysts (SACs) achieve higher selectivity due to their atomic dispersion, which creates uniform and isolated active sites that minimize side reactions requiring multiple adjacent sites. In hydrogenation reactions, such as selective hydrogenation of alkynes or nitroarenes, nanoparticle catalysts often have ensemble sites that facilitate over-hydrogenation or decomposition pathways. For example, in the hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene, Pd1/graphene SACs achieve near 100% butene selectivity with over 70% selectivity to 1-butene, whereas conventional Pd/C catalysts yield lower selectivity due to non-selective sites on nanoparticle surfaces. The atomic dispersion in SACs ensures that each metal atom acts independently, limiting the availability of contiguous sites for undesired reactions like C-C bond cleavage or further hydrogenation to alkanes. Additionally, the electronic structure of isolated atoms is tuned by the support, enhancing the adsorption strength for specific intermediates. This precision reduces the activation energy for desired pathways while suppressing competing reactions, leading to superior selectivity. The absence of particle facets and edges in SACs further eliminates heterogeneous active sites that contribute to unselective catalysis.",

      "1": "Undesirable deleterious side reactions can be mitigated if requiring more than one atomic active site, due to the high dispersion and isolation.",

    "question_text": "How do non-noble metal single-atom catalysts (SACs) such as Fe, Co, and Ni achieve comparable catalytic activity to noble metal SACs in CO oxidation reactions, and what specific molecular interactions contribute to their enhanced performance?",
    "standard_answer": "Non-noble metal SACs achieve comparable catalytic activity to noble metal SACs in CO oxidation through specific molecular interactions that lower activation barriers. For Ni-based SACs, the molecular interaction between a Ni atom and an adsorbed CO gas molecule is weaker than CO binding irreversibly with Pt1 and Ir1 atoms. This weaker binding leads to a lower barrier in CO2 formation, enhancing the CO oxidation process. Computational studies have confirmed that Fe-, Co- and Ni-based SACs are capable of providing comparable catalytic activity for CO oxidation as compared with noble metal-based SACs (e.g., Pd-, Pt-, Ru- and Rh-based SACs). The weaker CO binding in non-noble metals prevents strong adsorption that could poison active sites, while still maintaining sufficient reactivity for the oxidation reaction to proceed efficiently.",

      "1": "Liang et al. [68] found that the molecular interaction between a Ni atom and an adsorbed CO gas molecule is weaker than CO binding irreversibly with Pt1 and Ir1 atoms. This further leads to a lower barrier in CO2 formation (i.e., enhances the CO oxidation process) under the use of Ni.",

    "standard_answer": "Single atom catalysts enhance catalytic efficiency in combustion processes through several key mechanisms. In CO oxidation and PROX reactions, SACs like Pt₁/FeOₓ demonstrate superior performance due to complete atomic dispersion that maximizes metal utilization efficiency. The isolated atomic sites prevent undesirable side reactions that typically require multiple active sites, improving selectivity for target combustion products. Strong metal-support interactions stabilize single atoms against thermal aggregation at combustion temperatures and modify electronic properties to lower activation barriers for key reaction steps. For instance, Pt₁/FeOₓ SACs show 2-3 times higher reactivity for CO oxidation compared to conventional Au/Fe₂O₃ catalysts, with full regeneration capability even after multiple thermal treatment cycles. The uniform active sites provide consistent reaction environments, leading to more predictable and efficient catalysis under varying combustion conditions. These features allow SACs to achieve similar or superior catalytic performance with significantly lower metal loadings, making them particularly valuable for combustion applications where thermal stability and efficient fuel oxidation are critical.",

    "question_text": "How does atomic layer deposition (ALD) achieve precise control over metal loading and dispersion in single atom catalyst synthesis for energy applications, and what are the specific operational requirements and limitations of this approach according to the provided paper?",
    "standard_answer": "Atomic layer deposition (ALD) achieves precise control over metal loading and dispersion through self-limiting gas-surface reactions that deposit metal atoms in a layer-by-layer manner. Each ALD cycle involves alternating exposures of metal precursors and reactants where each precursor pulse saturates the support surface, ensuring uniform coverage. The self-limiting nature prevents multilayer formation and promotes atomic dispersion by relying on chemisorption that terminates once all available sites are occupied. Metal loading can be finely tuned by altering the number of ALD cycles - for example, Pt loading of 2.1 wt% or 7.6 wt% on N-doped graphene nanosheets can be achieved via 50 and 100 ALD cycles respectively, while 150 ALD cycles can increase Pt loading on graphene to 10.5 wt%. However, the ALD process requires ultraclean surfaces and is relatively slow, demanding greater energy consumption. These operational requirements lead to higher fabrication costs, which represents a significant limitation for large-scale production in energy system applications. The method has been successfully applied to synthesize Pt-graphene SACs for methanol oxidation reaction, N-doped graphene supports for hydrogen evolution reactions, and CeO2 supports for CO oxidation, demonstrating its utility in various energy conversion processes.",

    "standard_answer": "Strong metal-support interactions (SMSI) prevent metal atom agglomeration by creating favorable thermodynamic conditions that reduce the probability of atomic aggregation, which is a common challenge during SAC synthesis. The enhanced precursor-support interactions under high-temperature conditions create strong adhesive bonding between metal atoms and support materials, effectively anchoring individual atoms and preventing their migration and coalescence into clusters. Coordination site strategies function by assigning specific support sites with chemical linkers that adsorb or bind metal atoms through coordinate bonds. These chemical linkers create stable coordination environments that immobilize metal atoms and prevent their migration even under elevated thermal conditions. The combination of SMSI and coordination site engineering creates a dual stabilization mechanism where strong interfacial interactions work synergistically with chemical bonding to maintain atomic dispersion throughout high-temperature synthesis processes.",
