    "question_text": "For the ammonia decomposition reaction 2NH₃ ⇌ N₂ + 3H₂ at 800 K with equilibrium constant Kp = 1.2 × 10⁴ atm² and initial pure ammonia at 1 atm total pressure, calculate the theoretical hydrogen yield. Then, using the provided paper, explain how membrane reactors enhance ammonia conversion by citing specific mechanisms from the paper and discussing the reactor configurations that integrate catalytic reaction with hydrogen purification, focusing only on mechanisms explicitly supported by the citations.",
    "standard_answer": "For the reaction 2NH₃ ⇌ N₂ + 3H₂, the equilibrium constant is Kp = (P_N₂ * P_H₂³) / P_NH₃². Let x be the fraction of NH₃ decomposed. With initial pure NH₃ at P_total = 1 atm, the equilibrium partial pressures are: P_NH₃ = (1-x)/(1+x), P_N₂ = (x/2)/(1+x), P_H₂ = (3x/2)/(1+x). Substituting into Kp: 1.2×10⁴ = [((x/2)/(1+x)) * ((3x/2)/(1+x))³] / [((1-x)/(1+x))²]. Simplifying: 1.2×10⁴ = [(x/2) * (27x³/8)] / [(1-x)²] = (27x⁴/16) / (1-x)². Solving numerically yields x ≈ 0.985. The hydrogen yield is moles H₂ produced per mole initial NH₃: (3/2)x = 1.5 × 0.985 = 1.478 mol H₂/mol NH₃. Membrane reactors enhance conversion by integrating catalytic reaction and hydrogen purification in a single unit, thereby lowering the installation and operation costs. Hydrogen removal through Pd-based membranes can shift thermodynamic equilibrium and enhance the reaction kinetics, thereby increasing ammonia conversion and facilitating reaction at lower temperatures. The paper specifically discusses fixed-bed membrane reactors (FBMRs) and their integration of catalytic reaction with hydrogen purification, though it does not make specific performance claims about achieving complete conversion or higher efficiency compared to fixed-bed reactors.",
