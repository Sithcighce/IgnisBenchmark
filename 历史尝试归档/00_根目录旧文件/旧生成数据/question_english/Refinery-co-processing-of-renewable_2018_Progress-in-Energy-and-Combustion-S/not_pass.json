    "question_text": "Calculate and compare the hydrogen consumption for complete hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of a typical triglyceride molecule (C55H98O6) versus hydrodesulfurization (HDS) of a diesel-range sulfur compound (C12H25SH). Explain the reaction mechanisms and stoichiometry for both processes, and discuss how the significant difference in hydrogen requirements affects reactor design considerations in refinery co-processing units, particularly regarding hydrogen partial pressure requirements and heat management strategies.",
    "standard_answer": "For complete hydrodeoxygenation of triglyceride C55H98O6, the stoichiometric reaction involves multiple pathways. The triglyceride first undergoes hydrogenolysis to form fatty acids and propane: C55H98O6 + 3H2 → 3C18H36O2 + C3H8. Each fatty acid (C18H36O2) then undergoes hydrodeoxygenation via competing pathways: direct deoxygenation (C18H36O2 + 3H2 → C18H38 + 2H2O) or decarboxylation (C18H36O2 + H2 → C17H36 + CO2 + H2O). Considering the typical composition with unsaturated bonds requiring additional hydrogenation, complete HDO of C55H98O6 typically requires 12-15 moles H2 per mole triglyceride. For hydrodesulfurization of C12H25SH: C12H25SH + H2 → C12H26 + H2S, requiring only 1 mole H2 per mole sulfur compound. The fundamental difference arises from the high oxygen content in bio-feeds versus low sulfur content in petroleum feeds. As stated in the paper: 'The aim of hydroprocessing is to increase the hydrogen-to-carbon ratio and to almost completely remove undesirable heteroatoms such as sulfur, nitrogen, oxygen and some metals.' Additionally, 'HDO reactions are particularly important for bio-based feedstocks some of which might contain as much as 50 wt% oxygen.' This 12-15 fold higher hydrogen consumption for triglycerides necessitates significant reactor design modifications, including higher hydrogen partial pressures to drive HDO kinetics and prevent catalyst deactivation, and enhanced heat removal systems to manage the exothermic nature of simultaneous deoxygenation and saturation reactions in co-processing units.",
