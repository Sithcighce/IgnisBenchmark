    "question_text": "Why does dry reforming with CO2 offer the highest thermochemical recuperation potential but is prone to fast coking compared to steam reforming?",
    "standard_answer": "Dry reforming (e.g., CH4 + CO2 → 2CO + 2H2) offers superior thermochemical recuperation because it utilizes CO2 from exhaust gas as a reactant, converting low-value CO2 into syngas (CO + H2) with a high enthalpy increase per mole of primary fuel. The endothermicity of dry reforming (ΔH > 0) allows efficient waste heat recovery, and the reaction produces two moles of H2 and two moles of CO per mole of CH4, significantly boosting the reformate's heating value. However, dry reforming is highly susceptible to coking due to the Boudouard reaction (2CO → C + CO2), which is thermodynamically favored at typical reforming temperatures (600–900 K) and low H2/CO ratios. The absence of steam in dry reforming eliminates the protective effect of steam gasification (C + H2O → CO + H2), which in steam reforming continuously removes carbon deposits. Additionally, CO2 is a weaker oxidizing agent than H2O, leading to slower kinetics for carbon removal. Catalysts in dry reforming often deactivate as carbon blocks active sites, whereas steam reforming's higher H2O partial pressure suppresses carbon formation through equilibrium shifts and enhanced oxidation pathways.",

    "question_text": "Based on the thermodynamic and combustion principles discussed in the paper, explain how thermochemical recuperation with hydrogen-rich reformate improves internal combustion engine efficiency through the mechanisms of increased heating value, enhanced combustion characteristics, and operational flexibility. Include the thermodynamic basis for these improvements.",
    "standard_answer": "Thermochemical recuperation improves ICE efficiency through three primary mechanisms supported by the paper. First, the endothermic reforming reactions convert waste heat into chemical energy, increasing the heating value of the fuel mixture. This represents direct energy recovery from exhaust waste that would otherwise be lost. Second, the hydrogen-rich reformate provides enhanced combustion characteristics including increased flame velocity and wider flammability limits, enabling more complete and efficient combustion. Third, these combustion properties allow operational flexibility through lean burning options, reducing throttling losses at partial loads by enabling unthrottled operation. The thermodynamic basis lies in the conversion of low-quality thermal energy (exhaust heat) into high-quality chemical energy (reformate fuel), while the improved combustion characteristics reduce irreversibilities and enable operation closer to ideal Otto cycle efficiency. The combined effect reduces energy losses from incomplete combustion and heat transfer while maintaining the convenience of liquid fuel infrastructure.",

    "question_text": "Explain how pressure affects the equilibrium conversion in methanol steam reforming based on thermodynamic principles and Le Chatelier's principle. Discuss the relationship between pressure, temperature, and conversion for mole-increasing reactions like methanol steam reforming, and explain why higher pressures lead to declining equilibrium conversions with stronger effects at lower temperatures.",
    "standard_answer": "The effect of pressure on equilibrium conversion in methanol steam reforming can be understood through both thermodynamic analysis and Le Chatelier's principle. For the main methanol steam reforming reaction CH₃OH + H₂O ↔ CO₂ + 3H₂, there is a net increase of 2 moles of gas (from 2 moles of reactants to 4 moles of products). According to Le Chatelier's principle, when a system at equilibrium is subjected to increased pressure, the equilibrium shifts to favor the side with fewer moles of gas to counteract the pressure change. Therefore, increasing pressure shifts the equilibrium toward the reactant side, reducing methanol conversion. This pressure effect is more pronounced at lower temperatures because the equilibrium constant for endothermic reactions like methanol steam reforming decreases with decreasing temperature, making the system more sensitive to pressure changes. The relationship follows from the pressure dependence of equilibrium constants expressed in terms of partial pressures, where increasing total pressure suppresses conversion for reactions with positive mole change. This explains why methanol steam reforming systems typically operate at lower pressures to achieve higher conversions, especially when utilizing waste heat from internal combustion engines where temperatures may be limited.",

    "question_text": "Based on the provided paper excerpt, what are the key unresolved research challenges regarding reformate combustion characteristics in internal combustion engines, and how do these challenges relate to the fundamental properties of hydrogen-rich reformates?",
    "standard_answer": "The paper identifies several critical unresolved challenges in reformate combustion for internal combustion engines. First, the burning velocity of reformate at typical ICE conditions remains an open research question, despite the known general properties of hydrogen-rich mixtures. Second, the in-cylinder behavior of directly injected reformates requires further investigation, particularly how the unique physical properties of H2/CO mixtures affect fuel-air mixing and combustion processes. Third, particle formation mechanisms during reformate combustion need to be better understood. These challenges are directly related to the fundamental properties of hydrogen-rich reformates mentioned in the paper, including hydrogen's high mass diffusivity (0.78 × 10^-4 m²/s), wide flammability limits, and increased flame velocity. However, the paper explicitly states that detailed understanding of how these properties translate to actual engine performance under realistic operating conditions remains incomplete. The high reactivity of hydrogen that enables faster combustion also presents challenges for controlling combustion phasing and avoiding abnormal combustion events, requiring careful optimization of engine operating parameters.",

      "3": "Wide flammability limits and very low ignition energy of H2 present storage safety concerns at limited ventilation conditions because of the danger of explosive mixture formation that may cause severe damage. However, this is partially compensated for by a very high mass diffusivity of H2 (0.78 m¢10¡4/s), which is an order of magnitude higher than that of gasoline (0.07 m¢10¡4/s)."
