    "question_text": "Based on the provided paper content, how do hydrogen's higher flame speed and diffusivity specifically affect combustion efficiency and performance in dual-fuel diesel engines, and what competing mechanisms determine the net effect on brake thermal efficiency?",
    "standard_answer": "Hydrogen's higher flame speed and diffusivity influence combustion efficiency and performance in dual-fuel diesel engines through several competing mechanisms. The laminar flame speed of hydrogen, which varies between 1.85 and 2.9 m/s depending on factors such as pressure, temperature, turbulence intensity, combustion chamber shape and size, and equivalence ratio, accelerates combustion reactions. Simultaneously, hydrogen's superior diffusivity creates a more homogeneous air-fuel mixture in the combustion chamber. These properties collectively enhance combustion efficiency by ensuring better fuel-air mixing and faster energy release. However, these benefits are counterbalanced by increased heat transfer losses due to hydrogen's short quenching distance and high thermal conductivity, which intensify convective heat loss to combustion chamber walls. The net effect on brake thermal efficiency depends on the balance between improved combustion completeness due to enhanced flame speed and diffusivity versus increased heat losses. At optimal hydrogen inclusion rates, the combustion benefits typically outweigh the heat transfer penalties, but excessive hydrogen can lead to knocking combustion and reduced efficiency due to uncontrolled heat release patterns.",
