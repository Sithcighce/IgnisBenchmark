    "question_text": "Using Fourier's law and thermal diffusivity principles, explain how thermal conductivity affects thermal gradient development and thermomechanical stress in SOFC components, and discuss the implications for material selection between ferritic and austenitic steels based on their thermal properties as described in the provided paper.",
    "standard_answer": "Thermal conductivity directly governs thermal gradient development through Fourier's law of heat conduction (q = -k∇T), where heat flux is proportional to the thermal conductivity and temperature gradient. Lower thermal conductivities avoid reaching steady state temperature distributions fast, which after sometime result in large thermal gradients. These gradients are a measure between the cold and warm ends of the material. The importance of the thermal conductivity can be interpreted using the definition of thermal diffusivity (a) as: a = k/(C_pρ). At low thermal conductivities, a high thermal gradient develops within the material wall even at steady state. Compared to a material with higher thermal conductivity, the wall temperatures within the material will be higher, which is not beneficial thermomechanically. This property is one of the reasons ferrite steels are choices in fuel cell technologies compared to austenitic steels with their higher thermal conductivities and diffusivities. Moreover, due to the different thermal conductivities, different temperature distributions would develop when those steels are compared at steady state, as lower thermal gradients in ferritic steels result in lower thermal strain. The thermal conductivity selection must balance thermal management requirements with thermomechanical reliability considerations, particularly during critical operational stages where thermal gradients are most pronounced.",
