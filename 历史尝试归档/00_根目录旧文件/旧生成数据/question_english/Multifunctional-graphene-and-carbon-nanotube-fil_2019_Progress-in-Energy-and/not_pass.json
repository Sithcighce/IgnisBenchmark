    "question_text": "A graphene/Si planar heterojunction solar cell undergoes p-type doping with SOCl₂, which increases its open-circuit voltage (V_oc) from 0.5 V to 0.6 V, short-circuit current density (J_sc) from 25 mA/cm² to 28 mA/cm², and fill factor (FF) from 0.6 to 0.7. Given an incident power density of 100 mW/cm², calculate the absolute and relative improvements in power conversion efficiency (PCE). Explain the performance improvements based on the mechanisms described in the provided paper, focusing on how SOCl₂ doping affects the electrical properties of graphene and the resulting changes in solar cell parameters, with specific reference to the provided citations.",
    "standard_answer": "To calculate the PCE improvement, we use the formula: PCE = (V_oc × J_sc × FF) / P_in, where P_in = 100 mW/cm² = 0.1 W/cm². For the undoped cell: V_oc = 0.5 V, J_sc = 25 mA/cm² = 0.025 A/cm², FF = 0.6. PCE_initial = (0.5 × 0.025 × 0.6) / 0.1 = 0.0075 / 0.1 = 0.075 or 7.5%. For the doped cell: V_oc = 0.6 V, J_sc = 28 mA/cm² = 0.028 A/cm², FF = 0.7. PCE_doped = (0.6 × 0.028 × 0.7) / 0.1 = 0.01176 / 0.1 = 0.1176 or 11.76%. The absolute improvement is ΔPCE = 11.76% - 7.5% = 4.26%, and the relative improvement is (4.26 / 7.5) × 100% ≈ 56.8%. According to the paper, SOCl₂ acts as a p-type dopant that significantly improves solar cell performance. The paper states that 'Among the four molecules, SOCl₂ was the most effective dopant which improved the PCE of the graphene/Si PHJ solar cell by 230%.' This dramatic improvement is attributed to SOCl₂'s effectiveness in shifting the Fermi level of graphene downward, which increases the built-in potential at the graphene/Si junction, leading to higher V_oc. Additionally, the paper notes that 'SOCl₂ and HCl showed slightly better doping stability than HNO₃ and H₂O₂, which may be resulted from the more persistent adsorption of Cl atoms serving as the inter-tube linker.' This persistent adsorption contributes to stable performance improvements in J_sc and FF by maintaining reduced sheet resistance and improved charge carrier transport over time. The combined effects of Fermi level tuning and persistent doping stability explain the observed enhancements in all three key solar cell parameters.",
