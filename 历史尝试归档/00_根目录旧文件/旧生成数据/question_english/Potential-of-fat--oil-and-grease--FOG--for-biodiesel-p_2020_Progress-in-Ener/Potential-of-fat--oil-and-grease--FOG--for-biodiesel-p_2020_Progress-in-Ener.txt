Wastewater discharges from restaurants, kitchens, food processing plants and slaughterhouses contain 
high proportion of fat, oil, and grease (FOG). Critical overview on the attractive features, current state, 
and needed advancements are timely essential for FOG-derived biodiesel production. Although FOG con- 
version into biodiesel does not compete with human food, the high contents of moisture and free fatty 
acids (FFAs) are the main challenges for FOG eﬃcient utilization. The present review discussed the var- 
ious methods of high FFAs-lipidic feedstocks pretreatment including acid esteriﬁcation, steam stripping, 
nanocatalytic technology, biological conversion, glycerolysis, supercritical esteriﬁcation, and simultaneous 
in situ conversion. Comparing to other feedstocks, FOG-derived biodiesel showed better characteristics 
concerning oxidative stability, ﬂash point, cetane number, and total emissions. In addition, most of the 
FOG-derived biodiesel fuel met the recommendations of the international standards as well as conven- 
tional diesel. Due to its lower price, the economic analysis showed that FOG is a strong competitor to 
other biodiesel feedstocks. The decrease in feedstocks availability, continuous rise in the crude oil prices, 
life threatening environmental deterioration, and food-versus-fuel debate support FOG to be a potential 
biodiesel feedstock in the near future. However, the cost of FOG-biodiesel production is still far away 
from the acceptable ranges to compete fossil diesel. Lastly, this paper suggested a number of future per- 
spectives in order to enhance the economy and feasibility of FOG-derived biodiesel including developing 
new methods for eﬃcient conversion of brown grease, integrated approaches for sequential production 
of biofuels from FOG, and co-esteriﬁcation of FOG with other lipidic feedstocks.

1. Introduction 

The  concept  of  utilizing  fossil  fuels  is  gradually  getting  out 
of the vogue due to the excessive usage and associated adversi- 
ties.  Consequential  reﬂections  of  increasing  energy  demands,  se- 
vere environmental impacts and dwindling resources are the main 
alarms, which promoted the alternative energy research in recent 
years. Even though the developed nations started responding for 
the forthcoming energy crisis with signiﬁcant measures and goals, 
energy demand is still unprecedentedly increasing with ever grow- 
ing  population.  By  2030,  the  developing  nations  such  as  China, 
India, and Brazil are expected to consume higher energy due to 
their eventual population and economic growth, with an estimated 
global oil consumption of about 17 million BTe (Billion ton equiv- 
alent) [1] . Thus, the growth of population and eventual energy de- 
mand keep the continuous elevation in energy demand. In addi- 
tion, environmental deterioration due to fossil fuel usage and asso- 
ciated consequences to mankind seem to be an unbearable alarm. 
To exemplify, the carbon intensity of total primary energy supply 
2  TJ −1  (carbon intensity 
(TPES) remained same as 55–57 tons CO 
metric that estimates the tones of CO 
2 for each unit of TPES) from 
1990 [2] . As a consequence, about 4.2 million human deaths per 
year occur because of the ambient air pollution [3] . According to 
2019 Lancet countdown report [4] , emissions of greenhouse gases 
(GHGs) from fossil fuel exhibited the rise of about 2.6% from 2016 

to 2018. To reduce the global emissions to zero by 2050, about 7.2% 
reduction per year is needed from 2019 to 2050. Hence, the accel- 
eration of effective control measures is taken worldwide, and con- 
siderable progress in reduction of GHGs emissions and consequent 
premature mortality death was attained because of stringent emis- 
sion control measures [5] . However, further pragmatic approaches 
to treat the relevant adversities are required. Therefore, the shift 
to renewables is inevitably essential, not only because of resource 
depletion, but also to avoid the consequences of unclean environ- 
ment and relevant adversities produced by fossil fuel. Though the 
renewable energy usage is getting a considerable growth, it is still 
insuﬃcient to meet even less than a half of the global energy de- 
mands. For instance, renewable electricity generation was able to 
contribute by only 4.5% of the global demand in 2017 [6] . 

Decades of intensive research in ﬁnding the eﬃcient replace- 
ments  for  conventional  fuels  accelerated  some  prospecting  ap- 
proaches. Although there exists a wide range of search for alterna- 
tive fuels, biofuels have been discussed and suggested as a superior 
alternate for fossil-driven fuels since both are formed from biolog- 
ical source. Biofuels are the fuels extracted or produced from bio- 
logical origin such as lignocellulosic substances, oleaginous plants 
or microbes, lipids of animal fats, and municipal organic wastes. 
There are different types of biofuels such as biodiesel, crude bio- 
oil, bioethanol, biogas and biohydrogen. Amongst, liquid fuels are 
immensely attractive for direct application in the conventional en-

gine infrastructures. About 90% of engines are gasoline and diesel 
powered, which represents the vitality of liquid fuel research [7] . 
In 2017, the global oil demand rose by 1.6 MMb d −1 , accounting 
1.7% over 2016 [8] . Among all petroleum reﬁned products, the de- 
mand for diesel accounted the highest value of 430 Kb d −1 , with 
gasoline accounting for a signiﬁcantly smaller value of 270 Kb d −1 . 
The  current  increase  in  air  pollution  and  GHGs  are  attributed 
mainly  to  the  growing  and  outdated  vehicle  ﬂeet,  mainly  diesel 
vehicles [9] . Thus, biodiesel can tick the needed columns such as 
renewable, high caloriﬁc value, environmental-friendly, and liquid 
nature which make it an attractive alternate to fossil diesel with- 
out larger modiﬁcation in the conventional engine system [10] . 

Biodiesel  production  from  various  feedstocks  has  been  inves- 
tigated  extensively,  which  are  categorized  as  ﬁrst-,  second-  and 
third-generations.  The  ﬁrst-generation  feedstocks  mainly  include 
edible  plants,  which  compete  with  human  food,  freshwater,  and 
require large areas of fertile lands. However, the second- and third- 
generation feedstocks include non-edible resources such as ligno- 
cellulosic wastes, organic municipal wastes and algae, which are 
potential  to  nullify  the  sustainability  drawbacks  associated  with 
the ﬁrst-generation [11, 12] ]. Fig. 1 shows the global production and 
projections of biodiesel from 2010 to 2027 with country share in 
2018. Comparing to 25.0 billion liter production in 2010, the pro- 
duction increased by 50.0% in 2018, reaching 37.5 billion liter [13] . 
With such maturity in research area during recent years, biodiesel 
productions transformed to industrial scale in many countries. The 
top-biodiesel producing countries in 2018 were USA (21.2%), Brazil 
(16.6%),  Indonesia  (12.3%)  and  Germany  (10.8%).  Because  of  con- 
siderable research and many countries possess it as native crops, 
commercial applications of ﬁrst-generation feedstocks were more 
as  compared  to  other  generations.  The  expected  future  stability 
in biodiesel production and simultaneous reduction in the global 
trade ( Fig. 1 ) could be explained by the food-versus-fuel debate due 

to utilization of ﬁrst-generation feedstocks. Many countries intro- 
duced some policies to serve the dual purpose of increasing re- 
newable energy production with simultaneous reduction in GHGs 
emissions avoiding the impact on edible feedstocks [14, 15] . In that 
context, second- and third-generation biofuel feedstocks are highly 
concentrated at present to explore their sustainable feasibility for 
biofuel production. A detailed discussion and comparison of differ- 
ent biofuel generations was carried out by Nigam and Singh [10] . 
Several potential wastes have been suggested for biofuel produc- 
tion.  To  mention  few,  agricultural  wastes,  wastes  from  food  in- 
dustries, municipal wastes, sewage sludge, used cooking oil, and 
kitchen  wastes  have  been  studied  by  several  researchers  world- 
wide [16–20] . Amongst, feedstock possessing predominant propor- 
tions of lipids would be the ideal material for biodiesel production 
and such lipid-rich wastes are in the quest. 

Comparing  to  fossil  diesel,  the  current  production  cost  of 
biodiesel is extremely high which hampers its feasibility to com- 
pletely replace the conventional diesel. So far, there were numer- 
ous suggestions provided as an output of intensive research world- 
wide.  However,  feasibility  of  biodiesel  production  from  existing 
feedstocks is still at the pivot point of holding magniﬁcent advan- 
tages and yet-to-overcome challenges. Indeed, vegetable oil, animal 
fats and non-edible feedstocks could altogether contribute lesser 
than 10% of the total global demand with the present availability 
of the source. The debates such as devoting the lands and food- 
vs-fuels are additional inevitable quests. The major investments on 
non-edible feedstocks  failed to  act  as beacon,  like  microalgae in 
USA (NREL and ASP projects). Hence, ultimate alternative for fossil 
fuels is not yet found. In such context, fat, oil, and grease (FOG) 
seems promising and able to contribute a considerable large share 
with the available resources, and the strategy seems to be the fu- 
ture of the ﬁeld, at least for a shorter time frame [21–23] . Hence, 
the present review aims to evaluate the potential of FOG as a raw

material for sustainable biodiesel production, with in-depth discus- 
sion on the challenges of the present scenarios. Since characteris- 
tics of a feedstock are highly essential for producing biodiesel, FOG 
characteristics are discussed in detail based on the available liter- 
atures. The current FOG waste management, the fatty acid com- 
position of FOG, and potential challenges associated with biodiesel 
conversion are stated. To estimate the level of feasibility, the eco- 
nomic insights are prescribed for biodiesel production from FOG 
with feasible approaches and future perspectives as a road towards 
sustainability. Precisely, this paper can be considered as a primary 
reservoir for research community and industrial sectors aiming to 
utilize FOG for sustainable biodiesel production. 

acids recorded in different types of FOG are palmitic acid (satu- 
rated), oleic acid (monounsaturated), and linoleic acid (polyunsat- 
urated). However, edible feedstocks showed dominance of linoleic 
acid, which signiﬁcantly distinguishes their biodiesel characteris- 
tics from FOG (as discussed later in Section 5.1 ). Within FOG, veg- 
etarian kitchen generates FOG with more unsaturated fatty acids 
than  a  non-vegetarian  one  which  generates  more  saturated  fats. 
These proportions majorly affect the physicochemical characteris- 
tics of FOG such as liquidity and melting point. Alike fatty acids, 
content and composition of TAGs in FOG also depend upon the raw 
material used by the canteen or restaurant. Overall, the lipid proﬁle 
of FOG is primarily important for potential application in biodiesel 
production.

2.2. Physical properties of FOG 

FOG is a lipid-rich waste generated from many sources includ- 
ing food industries, hotels, restaurants and even multistoried apart- 
ments harboring multifamily. The precursors of FOG are plentiful 
of  edible  constituents  such  as  oils  obtained  from  cooking  prac- 
tices, meat in various forms (e.g. gravy, dishes, and raw wastes), 
baked stuffs, dairy products (e.g. cheese, milk, butter, yoghurt, and 
paneer),  and  beverages.  In  addition,  spent  bleaching  earth  (SBE) 
contains  signiﬁcant  proportions  of  oil,  about  17-40  wt%  and  are 
mainly contributed by the vegetable oil reﬁneries [24] . SBE results 
from the industrial processes such as degumming and bleaching of 
crude palm oil [25] , which are prevalently disposed by landﬁlls as 
one of the severe environmental deterioration practices. To miti- 
gate such environmental damage, potential utilization of SBE is re- 
searched worldwide for bio-organic fertilizers production, carbon 
production for adsorption, and char clay composite production for 
ozonation of recalcitrant [26, 27] . 

Direct  discharge  of  FOG  clogs  up  the  pipes  and  disturbs  the 
plumbing of individual housing resulting in property ﬂooding. The 
serious consequences of sewer pipes blocking results in sanitary 
sewer  overﬂows  (SSO)  which  further  causes  unhealthy  environ- 
mental and hygiene deteriorations. Recently, the major causes of 
sewer  blocks  were  attributed  to  FOG  in  many  counties  like  US 
(50%),  Malaysia  (70%)  and  UK  (50%)  [28, 29] ,  with  an  estimated 
annual  cost  of  about  US$  25  billion  for  removal  of  this  sewer 
blockage  in  US  alone  [29] .  Thus,  FOG  deposition  is  a  preceding 
alarm  globally  which  requires  an  effective  management.  Beyond 
few measures, no sustainably effective managements are devised 
so far. Hence, needed light should be ﬂashed at present before the 
issue gets even bigger because of growing population and eventual 
urbanization. 

2.1. FOG composition 

FOG mainly consists of free fatty acids (FFAs), triacylglycerols 
(TAGs),  esters,  waxes,  phospholipids,  sterols  and  sterol  esters. 
Among which, FFAs are vital due to the signiﬁcant high propor- 
tions and exhibiting chemical reactivity during the conversion pro- 
cess.  Usually,  FOG  obtained from  restaurants contains about  15% 
FFAs, which entirely depends upon the source of FOG. Based on 
FFAs content, FOG can be classiﬁed into two main groups, namely 
yellow grease (less than 15% FFAs) and brown grease (above 15% 
FFAs)  [30] .  For  instance,  about  8%  FFAs  content  was  detected  in 
grease interceptors located in the canteen of National University 
of Singapore [31] . Suto et al. [32] analyzed 27 different restaurant 
grease samples and recorded about 48% of saturated fats, whereas 
it  was  not  determined  in  the  dewatered  restaurant  grease  ana- 
lyzed by Parry et al. [33] . Thus, the proﬁle and concentration of 
total fatty acids largely depend upon the sources generating FOG. 
Table 1 shows the fatty acid proﬁle of different FOG in compar- 
ison with other edible feedstocks. In general, the dominant fatty 

Table 2 displays the physical and chemical properties of various 
FOG wastes generated in different locations across the world. The 
important physical properties of FOG evaluated in previous studies 
include density, moisture content, yield strength and metal ions. 
Apart from these, FOG looks colorless, odorless, tasteless and insol- 
uble in water. The average density of FOG was found to be within 
the range 0.76–0.95 g mL −1 ( Table 2 ). Previous studies conﬁrmed 
that addition of fatty acids does not inﬂuence the density of FOG, 
whereas less soluble Fe 3 + addition signiﬁcantly increased the den- 
sity [36] . It can be noted that total solids (TS) and volatile solids 
(VS)  are  relatively  high,  which  might  be  attributed  to  the  sepa- 
ration of semi-solid phase (i.e. FOG) from the liquid medium and 
the conglomerated nature of FOG. The moisture content is mainly 
inﬂuenced  by  the  different  ﬂows  within  the  sewer  pipes,  which 
results  in  layers  and  pores  formation  in  FOG  [29, 36] .  For  better 
understanding, the microscopic images were displayed in Figure 2 
which exemplify and mimic the layers and pores of FOG originated 
from different sources. The moisture binding aﬃnity of metal ions 
plays a signiﬁcant role in providing the moisture content. There- 
fore, the average moisture content showed a wide range of 0.51–
71.39% ( Table 2 ). 

Evaluating the yield strength of FOG is highly essential for ef- 
fective management. From Table 2 , the range of FOG yield strength 
or  hardness  reported  were  between  200  kPa  and  1239  kPa.  For 
better comparison, the yield strength of bar soap is 250–700 kPa, 
while  dry  clay  soil  has  a  yield  strength  greater  than  10 0 0  kPa. 
Fatty acid proﬁle is one of the vital factors determining the yield 
strength.  For  instance,  FOG  rich  in  palmitic  and  stearic  acids 
showed  higher  level  of  strength,  whereas  oleic  acid  resulted  in 
lower strength [36] . Apart from fatty acids, the source of FOG and 
its elemental composition showed signiﬁcant impact on the yield 
strength [36] . A conclusive note on these observations is that de- 
creased saturated fatty acids could prevent the hardening of de- 
posits and facilitates its removal. All these parameters and their 
impact on the chemical properties are important to be considered 
for evaluation of FOG conversion into biodiesel. 

2.3. Chemical composition and correlation to physical properties 

The chemical properties of FOG vary according to the collection 
site where it undergoes diversiﬁed reactions with different com- 
pounds in the sewer pipe. In order to understand the hardness as 
well as to reduce FOG deposition, the correlation between chem- 
ical composition and physical properties is very essential. In that 
context, Gross et al. [36] investigated the ranges of FOG deposition 
at 128 reaction conditions tested in laboratory with different levels 
of fatty acids (stearic, palmitic, oleic), and metal ions (Ca 2 + , Fe 2 + , 
Fe 3 + ). The study conﬁrmed the dependence of FOG physical prop- 
erties on the chemical composition. For instance, deposit weight 
increased (up to 58.6 g) with higher unsaturated fatty acids (when

10 g of oleic acid was added to FOG), while it decreased (to 10.0 
g) with high saturated fatty acids (10 g of palmitic acid). In ad- 
dition, the maximum density (up to 1.1 g mL −1 ) was observed by 
increasing palmitic acid content (up to 10 g). Results also showed 
that adding 0.5 g of Fe 2 + and Fe 3 + resulted in increase of pH value 
to 5.5, while adding 100 g of Ca 2 +  led to signiﬁcant increase in 
moisture content to the maximum recorded level (13.4%). Hence, 
FOG deposition could be controllable in a restaurant or an estab- 
lishment with a source of plant origin (unsaturated fat) than of an- 
imal origin (saturated fat). However, devoid of animal fats in mul- 
ticuisine is almost impossible and, therefore, it’s highly essential to 
obtain an effective route for such disposal, and for which alterna- 
tive utilization of FOG is required. Overall, understandings relevant 
to FOG composition and properties are highly important, not only 
for effective removal, but also for valuable utilization. 

3. Current FOG waste management 

The growing population and urbanization led to new establish- 
ments that generate more FOG and, hence, effective utilization is 
crucial for successful management. Fig. 3 shows the conventional 
routes of FOG management and recycling, in addition to the alter- 
native suggested route for energy production. In a typical process, 
FOG is separated on-site or from wastewater streams to prevent 
clogging of pipes and eventual sewer overﬂows. Food service es- 
tablishments usually install grease interceptors to remove FOG as 
"trap grease". Yellow grease is a kind of FOG comes from the ﬁl- 
tered waste cooking oil and has received a great attention as a po- 
tential candidate for biodiesel production. On the other hand, FOG 
collected  from  wastewater  treatment  plants  (WWTPs)  as  sludge 
are  familiarly  called  as  “sewage  scum”.  The  sewage  scum  clear- 
ance produces an estimated annual amount of 10.1 and 7.1 mil- 
lion dry tons in EU and US, respectively [42, 43] . Lipids obtained 

from sewage scum are called "brown grease", which cannot be re- 
cycled effectively. The conventional methods for brown grease dis- 
posal are incineration or landﬁll. 

There were certain eﬃcient initiatives around the world created 
in the aim of FOG waste management ( Table 3 ). The management 
approaches  initiated  mostly  as  pilot-scale  in  areas  with  adverse 
FOG problems. To mention few, the European “RecOil” project dur- 
ing 2012–2015 included various countries such as Denmark, Spain, 
Portugal, Greece and Italy. During the period of this project, about 
45% of the used cooking oil was collected and utilized for biodiesel 
production  which  in  turn  saved  about  30,0 0 0  Euro  and  reduced 
CO 
2 emissions by about 14.413 tones [44] . The program estimated 
that 1.5% of the EU-28 diesel consumption could be replaced by 
biodiesel produced from waste cooking oil [43] . Another familiar 
program was initiated in 2008 by Ireland, namely Dublin FOG Pro- 
gramme, to inspect the food service outlets and set the legal limit 
of discharge as under 100 mg L −1  [45] . In addition, Sweden and 
Norway by 2015 brought the control of FOG-mediated sewer block 
through education and awareness campaign. In general, the various 
measures, schemes  and policies created  in controlling FOG  were 
previously studied. However, the follow up of the schemes and re- 
ports on those mitigation levels were scarcely reported. Especially, 
there  are  many  literatures  dealt  with  those  mitigation  schemes 
and relevant outputs, but it’s essential now to recall and reorga- 
nize those management schemes. Amongst, potential utilization of 
FOG for energy production are incrementally grabbing the atten- 
tion nowadays.

The project funded by the Natural Science and Engineering Research 
Council of Canada (NSERC). The programme aimed to apply the 
co-digestion of FOG with TWAS to enhance the quantity and quality 
of biogas produced, and the outcomes were published in 2018. 

During 2012-2015, it aimed to increase the awareness towards 
recycling of used cooking oil for sustainable biodiesel production. It 
was estimated that 1.5% of the EU-28 diesel consumption could be 
replaced by biodiesel produced from waste cooking oil. 
Starting in 2008 and according to the programme, all yellow grease 
and grease trap wastes must be collected in a proper way. For that, 
GTSs were suggested for all food service outlets that must be 
maintained. 
Installation of suitable GTSs increased to 80% in 2014 (comparing to 
14% in 2008). Therefore, 11 × 10 4

with 2500 food service outlets manipulated 60 million gallons of 
FOG annually. 
In 2010, the study showed that problems related to sewer grease 
accumulation cost approximately US$ 3.5 million annually. Yellow 
grease can be easily collected for biodiesel production.

done physically using grease traps/interceptors (GTIs) or through 
biological removal. 

3.1.1. Physical separation 

GTIs are the conventional systems for FOG removal which can 
be located either down to the sink or below the ground. The ma- 
jor principle involved in GTIs is gravity separation by which the 
suspended debris are removed from the eﬄuent, while the clari- 
ﬁed water ﬂushed to the sewer system. Hydraulic retention time 
(HRT) is the time required for separation, which varies based on 

the inﬂow rate during the day. In addition, the characteristics of 
FOG such as suspended solids, biological/chemical oxygen demands 
and pH are dynamic even in a single day. Thus, regular emptying 
of GTIs is essential for better management, which was advised at 
different times and percentages based on FOG characteristics. How- 
ever, Mattsson et al. [51] reported that emptying needs to occur 
when the deposition reaches 25%, and this emptying interval re- 
ported to be critical for fastest removal of fatty acids in case of 
long chain free fatty acids (LCFAs) recovery.

tein  conversion  [64] .  In  that  context,  FOG  was  reported  to  pro- 
mote  methane yield  up  to  3.5-fold  [65] .  In  co-digestion  process, 
both sludge and FOG are subjected to a pretreatment step, which 
include  physical  (e.g.  high-pressure  homogenization,  ultrasonica- 
tion, microwave irradiation), chemical (acid/alkali, thermochemical, 
enzymatic), or biological treatments [66] . In general, the pretreat- 
ment aims to breakdown the larger molecules into simple compo- 
nents to enhance the microbial accessibility for better digestion. 

Even though there are much research is turned on towards co- 
digestion of FOG for biomethane production, there are certain lim- 
itations hindering the better yield. The hindrances are mainly due 
to  the  components  within  the  FOG  and  intermediates  generated 
during the co-digestion. In that context, LCFAs in FOG are the ma- 
jor concern as the high concentrations of these fatty acids showed 
detrimental  effect  to  methanogenic  bacteria  [67, 68] .  There  is  no 
deﬁned solution for such inhibition so far, but different studies re- 
vealed that the inhibition is not uniformly observed with various 
FOG wastes [69] . The reason for such inhibition might be due to 
the surfactant nature of LCFAs which affect the cellular membrane 
of bacteria involved in digestion process. Another concern is the 
sludge ﬂotation and wash out because of soap formation by LCFAs, 
which in turn reduces the biomethane yield [70, 71] . These handful 
of concerns potentially act as pitfalls in anaerobic co-digestion of 
FOG. The challenges and concerns of FOG co-digestion with other 
organic feedstocks were recently reviewed potentially in literatures 
[68, 69, 72–74] ]. Thus, the above-mentioned concerns, microbial de- 
pendence, and gaseous fuel keep the option of biomethane produc- 
tion from FOG as less attractive. Recently, potential directions for 
producing liquid biofuels from FOG, especially biodiesel, are gar- 
nering wider attentions. 

3.2.2. Thermochemical conversion of FOG 

Thermochemical  conversion,  i.e.  enhancement  of  chemical 
transformations of biomass into energy at elevated temperature, is 
a renowned technique for processing a wide range of feedstocks 
[12, 75–80] . There are very meagre reports dealt directly with ther- 
mochemical conversion of lipid-rich feedstocks. For example, palm 
oil-derived  fatty  acids  [81]  and  soybean  oil  cake  [82]  were  suc- 
cessfully  pyrolyzed  into  gasoline-like  products  and  crude  bio-oil. 
Recently,  catalytic  cracking  of  FOG  obtained  from  GTIs  of  differ- 
ent scales such as bench-, laboratory- and pilot-scales was stud- 
ied  [83] .  The  resulting  products  contained  more  than  90%  hy- 
drocarbons  including  aromatics,  alkenes,  alkanes  and  cycloalka- 
nes.  In  addition,  lipid-rich  wastes  proven  to  be  effective  for  co- 
processing with other feedstocks. For instance, microwave vacuum 
co-pyrolysis of waste cooking oil and plastics resulted in liquid bio- 
oil with higher energy content (46 MJ kg −1 ), improved the product 
stability along with attractive properties such as low oxygen con- 
tent  without  sulfur  nor  nitrogen  [84] .  However,  thermochemical 
conversion methods are energy intensive due to the applied high 
temperature, in addition to other mechanical and maintenance is- 
sues. Moreover, the process is diﬃcult to control and requires a 
large capital investment. On comparing FOG thermochemical con- 
version and biodiesel production, the latter is widely studied. How- 
ever,  thermochemical  conversion  is  less  investigated,  except  for 
few recent publications. In addition, optimized conditions of FOG 
thermochemical conversion are scarce and those knowledges need 
to be incorporated. 

3.2.3. Biodiesel production 

One  of  the  holistic  effective  ways  for  FOG  management  is 
biodiesel  production  by  esteriﬁcation/transesteriﬁcation  of  fats. 
Since FOG is rich in lipids, it is suggested as a cost-effective feed- 
stock  for  biodiesel,  which  overcomes  many  economic  disadvan- 
tages associated with the utilization of other feedstocks. In spite

through bioaugmentation for biological FOG removal. 

3.1.2. Biological removal 

Fatty acids in FOG can be effectively utilized by microorganisms 
through a process called bioaugmentation ( Fig. 4 ), which is con- 
sidered as the biological mode of FOG management [56] . Through 
bioaugmentation, about 59% and 40% reductions in fatty acids and 
FOG  deposit  formation,  respectively,  were  recorded  [57] .  A  ﬁxed 
ﬁlm  containing  immobilized  bacteria  was  also  used  for  FOG  re- 
moval and achieved 24% higher eﬃciency than normal GTIs [58] . 
In addition, Nisola et al. [58] studied the removal of synthetic FOG 
made from soybean oil at a laboratory scale using lipase produc- 
ing bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa comparing with physical re- 
moval  using  typical  GTIs.  During  30  days  of  study,  93%  removal 
of  1044  mg  FOG  L −1  by  biological  method  was  recorded,  while 
physical  method  showed  75%  removal  of  463  mg  FOG  L −1 .  The 
study also emphasized that biological removal performs better at 
increased FOG load than physical removal. However, many factors 
such as inﬂow speed, quantity and characteristics of the inﬂowing 
eﬄuent signiﬁcantly affect the biological removal eﬃciency. How- 
ever,  inconsistency  of  FOG,  ﬂushing  of  microorganism,  and  long 
term establishment of these colonies are the main factors which 
limits the applicability of this method [59] . Using integrated ap- 
proach for FOG conventional removal by GTIs followed by cultiva- 
tion of microorganisms on FOG as a nutrient source might be an 
effective approach for advanced FOG management ( Section 6.3 ). 

3.2. Energy production 

3.2.1. Biomethane production 

Anaerobic digestion was recently studied as a promising route 
for  conversion  of  sludge  into  biomethane  [60–62] .  However,  the 
contemporary challenge of anaerobic digestion is the lesser con- 
version  of  waste  sludge  (40–50%)  [63] .  In  order  to  address  this 
challenge,  co-digestion  of  organic  substrates  along  with  waste 
sludge was recently studied for attaining maximum digestion and, 
thereby, improving biomethane yield. In the quest of ﬁnding the 
suitable substrate for co-digestion, lipid-rich FOG was reported to 
enhance the yield of methane by supporting more than 90% of con- 
version, comparing to 50–70% in case of carbohydrates and pro-

of its potential characteristics, biodiesel production from FOG pos- 
sesses some profound challenges. FOG is known for its diversiﬁed 
nature based on the resources generating it, with different com- 
position  and  respective  characteristics  as  discussed  earlier.  Har- 
nessing such diversiﬁed qualities for a particular fuel production 
has  many  potential  challenges.  FOG  possesses  various  ranges  of 
lipids and FFAs, whereas different biodiesel conversion technolo- 
gies  show  speciﬁcity  over  the  raw  material  for  effective  conver- 
sion. Thus, not all FOG constituents can be effectively converted 
into  biodiesel using  a  single technology.  For  instance,  only  TAGs 
are highly preferred raw material for conventional transesteriﬁca- 
tion to attain maximum biodiesel yield. Inappropriately, FOG might 
contain up to 90% of FFAs which hinders the transesteriﬁcation re- 
action. Moreover, there are other potential contaminants and met- 
als in FOG that inﬂuence the conversion eﬃciency and biodiesel 
quality. 

The important biodiesel properties such as cloud point, kine- 
matic viscosity, pour point, etc. are mainly controlled by the pro- 
portion of different fatty acids. As discussed earlier, there is a sig- 
niﬁcant  variation  in  fatty  acid  proﬁle  of  FOG  comparing  to  ed- 
ible  feedstocks.  In  general,  various  reports  stated  that  palmitic, 
stearic and oleic acids are the predominant fatty acids in FOG. The 
presence of these acids in larger proportions results in biodiesel 
characteristics similar to conventional fossil diesel [85–87] . How- 
ever, even within various types of FOG such as yellow and brown 
greases, potential differences in linoleic acid proportions were ob- 
served (see Table 1 ). Such differences in fatty acid composition ob- 
viously reﬂect the impact on biodiesel characteristics ( Section 5.1 ). 
Another vital point is the diversity and inconsistence of FOG, hence 
universal optimization of biodiesel production from FOG is not fea- 
sible and need to be optimized individually based on the respec- 
tive composition. For that, studying the effect of FOG composition 
on biodiesel production might help in developing a universal ap- 
propriate pretreatment and conversion technology. 

4. FOG-to-biodiesel conversion 

The appropriate conversion method should be economically fea- 
sible with low energy requirements, minimum chemical consump- 
tion, low eﬄuent of toxic byproducts, and simple for implementa- 
tion in large-scale [88] . Due to the high FFAs content of FOG, pre- 
treatment is a necessary step to remove or convert majority of FFAs 
into TAGs as intermediates or directly to fatty acid methyl esters 
(FAMEs). To reduce the high FFAs to the acceptable levels, many 
conversion methods were suggested which include acid esteriﬁca- 
tion [89] , steam stripping [90] , nanocatalytic technology [91, 92] , bi- 
ological conversion [93 , glycerolysis 94] , and supercritical esteriﬁ- 
cation [95] , in addition to simultaneous in situ conversion of FOG 
into biodiesels [96] as discussed in this section. 

4.1. Acid esteriﬁcation 

Acid  esteriﬁcation  is  the  conventional  method  of  pretreating 
FFAs-rich feedstocks, which involves esteriﬁcation of FFAs through 
reaction with alcohol in the existence of acid catalyst at ≈65 °C 
resulting  in  esters  formation  [97] .  Initially,  the  FFAs  are  proto- 
nated to form oxonium ion, which undergoes an exchange reaction 
with alcohol forming an intermediate ( Fig. 5 ). The produced pos- 
itive charged intermediate loses a proton to become stable form- 
ing fatty acid ester. It is noteworthy to mention that the reactions 
are  reversible  and  the  equilibrium  point  of  the  reaction  is  dis- 
placed in the presence of alcohol in excess amount. The theoret- 
ical stoichiometry of the esteriﬁcation reaction shows that 1 mol 
of methanol is required for conversion of 1 mol of FFAs to even- 
tually produce 1 mol of FAMEs and water as a byproduct. How- 
ever, excess of methanol is required in order to attain the equi- 

librium and achieve the maximum yield of esters [89] . After acid 
esteriﬁcation, the byproducts (TAGs) are processed using the con- 
ventional  alkaline-catalytic  transesteriﬁcation  for  FAMEs  produc- 
tion and glycerol is generated as a ﬁnal byproduct.

Reaction conditions are crucial factors in affecting the conver- 
sion eﬃciency. Table 4 shows the suggested optimum conditions 
of FOG acid hydrolysis in some previous studies. It can be noticed 
from  the  table  that  the  optimum  conditions  and  corresponding 
conversion  eﬃciency  vary  widely  with  different  FOG  f eedstocks. 
National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) suggested an opti- 
mum dosage of methanol (2.25 g) and sulfuric acid (50 mg) for 
each gram of FFAs in the oil sample containing 5% FFAs (equiva- 
4 ). Ap- 
lent to a molar ratio of 19.8:1 methanol:FFAs and 5% H 
plying these conditions using FOG containing 15% FFAs resulted in 
low FFAs conversion eﬃciency, as low as 80% [98] . Later, Chai et 
al. [97] suggested the optimum conditions of 40:1 methanol:FFAs 
molar ratio with 10% H 
4 for esterifying the FFAs within a range 
of 15–35% at 600 rpm and 65 °C, which enhanced the conversion 
eﬃciency to 95% ( Table 4 ). Even the same FOG on storage, com- 
position might change due to natural hydrolysis of FOG, which re- 
quires readjustment for the optimum conditions. In that context, 
the FFAs level in FOG exceeded from 8% to 15% after storage for 20 
days, while about 217% increase in FFAs content was observed in 
the same FOG at the 13 th day [31] . Hasuntree et al. [99] reported 
the reduction of acid value of restaurant trap greases from 60.4 mg 
KOH g −1 to 11.6 mg KOH g −1 by applying methanol:FFAs ratio of 
4 at 60 °C for 60 min, which resulted in 83.6% FFAs 
2 SO 
5:1, 5% H 
conversion. Using AlCl 
2 O as a catalyst for acid hydrolysis of 
brown grease at 47 °C resulted in higher conversion eﬃciency of 
90% in less than 4 h [100] . The high eﬃciency of AlCl 
2 O as 
a catalyst might be attributed to the large amounts of pores and 
large pore size which increase the accessibility of reactants into the 
catalyst accelerating the reaction rate [101] . Thus, reaction condi- 
tions during acid esteriﬁcation showed signiﬁcant impact in reduc- 
ing the FFAs and producing magniﬁcently higher ester yields.

In order to further improve both yield and characteristics of the 
produced ester, effort s have been done in studying the reaction ki- 
netics. The kinetics and thermodynamics of esteriﬁcation process 
are inﬂuenced by the reaction conditions including methanol:FFAs 
molar ratio, mixing speed, reaction time, reactor temperature, and 
the  applied  catalyst.  In  early  1970s,  Dufek  et  al.  [102]  studied 
the kinetics of acid-catalyzed esteriﬁcation/transesteriﬁcation of 9- 
(16)-carboxystearic acid using different alcohols. Results conﬁrmed 
that esteriﬁcation is highly dependent on the concentration of acid 
catalyst,  where  every  additional  20  mg  of  sulfuric  acid  doubled 
the  reaction  constant  ( k 5 ).  Results  showed  linear  plots  of  9(10)- 
carboxystearic acid at a given catalyst concentration against time 
up to 90% conversion with ﬁrst-order kinetics. Both reaction time 
and temperature were also reported to signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the 
overall reaction kinetics. For instance, the volumetric mass trans- 
fer coeﬃcient during conversion of Karanja oil into biodiesel in- 
creased by 6.5-fold due to temperature increment from 35 °C to 
55  °C  [103] .  Moreover,  high  temperature  resulted  in  irreversible 
methanolysis reaction due to a more dominant equilibrium reac- 
tion rate. Thermodynamic parameters are important to understand 
the variation of enthalpy ( (cid:2)H), entropy ( (cid:2)S), and Gibbs free en- 
ergy  ( (cid:2)G)  during  the  conversion  process  [104, 105] .  In  that  con- 
text, Eyring equation ( Eq. 1 ) [106] offers accurate calculations of 
rate  constant  and  provides  insight  into  the  reaction  progress  at 
the molecular level [107, 108] . It also supports the transition state 
model, evaluates the relationship between different thermodynam- 
ics parameters, and evaluates the spontaneity of a given reaction 
[105] .

k B and h represent the Boltzmann constant (1.38 × 10 −23 J K −1 ) and 
the Planck constant (6.63 × 10 −34 J s), respectively. (cid:2)S and (cid:2)H can 
be determined by considering (cid:2)G = (cid:2)H - T (cid:2)S and taking the nat- 
ural logarithm, resulting in Eq. 2 [109] ;

From the previous equation, the values of (cid:2)S and (cid:2)H can be 
obtained from the intercept and slope of the linear plot between 
1/T  and  ln(k/T) .  Positive  values  of (cid:2)G  and (cid:2)H  indicate  that  the 
esteriﬁcation reaction is endothermic and the process is not spon- 
taneous. However, negative values of (cid:2)S indicate the synchroniza- 
tion of the reactants to form the products and bring further order 
to the reaction system [110] . 

Various kinetic models have been carried out also to study the 
impact  of  mixing  on  the  esteriﬁcation/transesteriﬁcation  process 
[111–115] . The mixing rate of a system with speciﬁc ﬂow charac- 
teristics, geometric, and power supply can be determined by ap- 
plying the interrelation of two dimensionless numbers according 
to Leevijit et al. [116] using Eqs. (3 )–( 4 );

where N p and N Re represent the power number and the Reynolds 
number, respectively; g c is the Newton’s gravity acceleration, p is 
the mixer power consumption; ρ is the ﬂuid density, D a and N are 
the impeller diameter and speed, respectively, while μ is the ﬂuid 
dynamic viscosity. Although such kinetics models showed a strong 
relationship to the experimental results, they can be used only to 
predict the reaction progress of a single tested model. In addition, 
complex conditions and external disturbances of batch systems re- 
sult in unavoidable modeling errors which eventually affect the ﬁ- 
nal products yield. 

4.1.1. Methanol:FFAs molar ratio 

Optimization studies on FOG acid esteriﬁcation pretreatment as 
well as other FFAs-rich oils showed a strong relationship between 
alcohol and FFAs molar ratio. For instance, Chai et al. [97] studied 
the effect of methanol:FFAs molar ratio and reaction temperature 

to achieve a target acid value < 2 mg KOH g −1 . Results conﬁrmed 
that the gradual reduction of methanol:FFAs molar ratio between 
50:1 to 20:1 resulted in achieving the target acid ratio at higher 
temperature. Using 50:1 methanol:FFAs ratio showed satisfactory 
acid value at all studied temperatures (35, 45, 55, and 65 °C), while 
reduction of methanol:FFAs ratio to 30:1 required higher tempera- 
ture (55 and 65 °C) to achieve the targeted acid value. Further re- 
duction of methanol:FFAs ratio to 20:1 failed in achieving the tar- 
get acid value at any of the studied conditions. It can be concluded 
that excessive alcohol, to a certain limit, is essential to achieve the 
high conversion eﬃciency. From economic aspect, keeping the FFAs 
content at lower concentrations is essential to reduce the require- 
ment of methanol for FOG acid esteriﬁcation. Hence, the optimal 
concentration ranges can be ﬁxed based on FOG composition. 

4.1.2. Mixing speed 

4 ) 

2 SO 

2 (SO 

3  and  H 

Due  to  the  heterogeneous  nature  of  the  reaction  system  in 
which methanol and lipids are immiscible, mixing speed has been 
speculated  as  a  signiﬁcant  parameter  for  eﬃcient  esteriﬁcation, 
which is also correlated to other reaction conditions. In a previ- 
ous study, static esteriﬁcation resulted in low reduction in the acid 
value  by  20%  and  60%  using  Fe 
4 ,  respectively, 
while increasing the mixing speed up to 350 rpm signiﬁcantly im- 
proved the acid value reduction to 93% [31] . Thus, it may not be 
feasible  to  achieve  acceptable  FFAs  level  under  static  conditions, 
even  if  the  esteriﬁcation  still  occurs  due  to  reaction  time  elon- 
gation. Most of the lab-scale experiments performed the reaction 
mixing using orbital shaking.  However, mixing in  the industrial- 
scale is usually performed by stirring. In this perspective, strate- 
gic transformation into the industrial-scale requires a measure to 
replicate the speed used in laboratory. For which, the orbital speed 
will be translated to equivalent Reynolds number as a way of de- 
termining the stirring speed counterpart [117] . To exemplify, the 
Reynolds numbers of 1635, 934 and 584 were derived for the or- 
bital speed of 30 0, 20 0 and 125 rpm, respectively [31] . On com- 
paring to an orbital shaker, an impeller device (diameter = 4 cm, 
rotational  speed = 150  rpm)  is  equivalent  to  a  Reynolds  number 
of  3300.4,  which  conﬁrms  that  impeller  devices  possess  higher 
Reynolds number and results in signiﬁcant breakdown of droplets 
in the two-phase liquid system, altogether results in faster reaction 
rates.  Although  mixing  speed  is  a  crucial  parameter  that  should 
be  considered,  reaction  time  and  temperature  are  preferred  for 
achieving eﬃcient cost-effective esteriﬁcation.

4.1.3. Reaction time and temperature 

Reaction time is another critical parameter that signiﬁcantly in- 
ﬂuences the conversion eﬃciency. For instance, increase of reac- 
tion time from 10 min to 60 min using 70 W microwave assisted 
FAMEs production at constant temperature of 73 °C resulted in en- 
hancement of FAMEs yield from 34% to 88% [118] . However, longer 
pretreatment time is not preferred due to high energy consump- 
tion and reduction of reaction rate which increase the process cost 
with  lower  productivity.  In  addition,  longer  reaction  time  might 
lead to reverse reaction or results in biodiesel evaporation, result- 
ing in signiﬁcant reduction in the yields [119] . Reaction time di- 
rectly depends on various factors that inﬂuence the FFAs conver- 
sion rate ( Table 4 ). Although excess of methanol was reported to 
shorten  the  reaction  time,  the  elevated  cost  of  methanol  recov- 
ery negatively affects the process feasibility. High energy applica- 
tion using heat or radiation is another important factor needs to 
be considered for enhanced biodiesel production at a shorter re- 
action time. Ultrasonic and microwave irradiation under enzyme- 
catalyzed pretreatment was reported to signiﬁcantly enhance mass 
transfer by cavitation [120–122] , which could also shorten the re- 
action time. In that context, hydrodynamic cavitation resulted in 
up to 4.9- and 5-times higher rate constant and shorter reaction 
time, respectively, compared to mechanical stirring [123] . However, 
such approach could not be applied for the industrial scale due to 
high energy consumption. Thus, optimization of reaction tempera- 
ture is important for predicting the shortest reaction time required 
to achieve eﬃcient reduction in FFAs content to the acceptable lev- 
els.

Table 4 shows the impact of temperature, together with other 
parameters,  on  the  FFAs  conversion  eﬃciency  of  different  feed- 
stocks. Higher temperature could reduce the time of pretreatment 
by promoting mass transfer. For instance, comparing the results of 
Montefrio et al. [31] and Tran et al. [124] who studied the conver- 
sion eﬃciency of FFAs in FOG ( Table 4 ) showed that increasing of 
temperature from 50 °C to 70 °C resulted in higher FFAs conversion 
eﬃciency at shorter reaction time (3 h instead of 24 h) and lower 
catalyst ratio (3 wt% instead of 10 wt%). It is important to mention 
that  other  reaction  conditions  in  the  previous  comparison  could 
also interfere and inﬂuence the FFAs conversion. In addition, in- 
creasing of temperature results in signiﬁcant increase in FFAs con- 
version. However, the optimum temperature depends mainly upon 
the catalyst involved in the reaction. For instance, reduction of acid 
value to < 1 mg KOH g −1 within 24 h at different tem peratures us- 
ing H 
4 as a catalyst was studied [31] , where the shortest time 
of 4 h was recorded at the maximum applied temperature of 50 °C. 
3  as  a  catalyst  was  not  eﬃcient  enough 
However,  using  Fe 
to  achieve  the  target  acid  value,  even  at  a  temperature  as  high 
as 50 °C. Therefore, higher reaction temperature was suggested in 
case  of  using  Fe 
3  for  eﬃcient  FOG  pretreatment.  For  that, 
Wang  et  al.  [125]  reported  95  °C  as  a  suitable  temperature  for 
3 catalyzed methanolysis of FOG. These evidences strongly 
Fe 
conﬁrm that the reaction temperature, together with the type of 
catalyst, inﬂuence the reaction time and FFAs conversion eﬃciency. 
For  successful  reduction  in  FFAs  content,  all  the  aforementioned 
three parameters need to be optimized synchronously by consider- 
ing the potential interactions among different parameters. Despite 
the signiﬁcant impact of temperature on reaction time, alternative 
processes  are  required  due  to  the  intensive  energy  consumption 
associated with elevated temperature. In that regard, catalytic con- 
version was discussed as an alternative approach.

4.1.4. Catalysts 

Application  of  catalyst  is  vital  to  accelerate  the  reaction  rate 
towards  higher  product  yield.  Catalysts  involved  in  esteriﬁca- 
tion/transesteriﬁcation  processes  can  be  categorized  into  three 
main groups namely homogeneous, heterogeneous and enzymes.

The major merit of homogeneous catalysts (base or acid) is their 
high  catalytic  activity  which  results  in  shorter  reaction  time.  In 
addition, homogeneous catalysts are inexpensive and require rel- 
atively lower temperature. However, reactions with homogeneous 
catalysts require higher concentration of alcohol. Additionally, cat- 
alyst separation step is inevitable which limits their applications 
only for the batch-scale. Recently, some heterogeneous solid acid 
catalysts  were  developed  for  esteriﬁcation  which  have  the  char- 
acteristics of both mineral acids and heterogeneous basic catalyst 
(such as mesoporous silicas, heteropolyacids, acidic polymers, and 
zeolites). Such catalysts are capable of achieving simultaneous ac- 
tion of reducing the high FFAs level and water content in FOG. The 
main merit of solid acids is the immiscibility with oil avoiding the 
requirement for puriﬁcation step or eﬄuent treatment [129, 130] . 
However, due to the higher cost of solid catalysts, homogeneous 
acids are preferred.

by optimizing the reaction conditions based on the FFAs content in 
FOG, while methanol and catalyst can be recovered to reduce the 
ﬁnal cost. However, methanol and liquid acid catalysts are miscible 
in water requiring a distillation step for recovery and, therefore, it 
is not energy eﬃcient. Other drawbacks of using acid catalyst in- 
clude reactor corrosion and salt deposition in the reaction vessel. 
Using metal catalyst such as Fe

life cycle assessment of acid esteriﬁcation using different catalysts 
and reaction conditions would help to provide a fair evaluation and 
comparison of the process.

4.2. Steam stripping 

Steam stripping is currently used to separate organic contami- 
nants from wastewater in order to meet the limits of “Maximum 
Achievable Control Technology (MACT)” standards set by the Envi- 
ronmental Protection Agency (EPA). The organics and steam from 
the column top are then condensed and separated with the help 
of decanter, while the condensed steam is again reﬂuxed to the 
column  top  ( Fig.  6 ).  Conceptually,  there  are  two  designs  for  the 
stripping columns; the ﬁrst is “sieve tray stripper ”, in which dif- 
ferent sieve trays are arranged with steam bubbling rings to inject 
the stripping steam upward while the liquid injected from the top 
reaching  optimal  gas-liquid  contact  by  providing  a  large  contact 
surface  along  with  an  optimal  stripping  steam  distribution  ( Fig. 
6 ). The second design is “packed bed stripper ”, in which  package 
beds are used instead of trays to lower the required pressure of 
vapor phase with optimal gas-liquid contact. Based on the fact of 
higher volatility of FFAs compared with TAGs, steam stripping can 
be used as a physical reﬁning process for FOG. Recently, Usseglio 
et al. [90] proposed the use of a non-equilibrium model to evalu- 
ate the stripping processes using a structured packed column and 
two  different kinds  of  vegetable oils  (soybean oil  and palm oil). 
The  study  showed  a  ﬁnal  FFAs  content  as  low  as  0.005%  which 

conﬁrms its technical feasibility in FOG pretreatment. The main ad- 
vantages of steam stripping include no soap formation, the eﬄuent 
is treated, and the pollutants byproducts are minimized. However, 
high energy consumption and the elevated operating and invest- 
ment costs are the main drawbacks of steam stripping. 

4.3. Nanocatalytic technology 

Nanotechnology can be deﬁned as engineering at the nanoscale 
(1–100 nm), which is recognized as a recent advancement in the 
ﬁeld of energy and environment [131–134] . Particularly, the spe- 
ciﬁc characteristics of nanocatalysts provide the possibility to solve 
various bottleneck limitations associated with esteriﬁcation and/or 
transesteriﬁcation reactions. The use of nanomaterials as catalysts 
in  biodiesel  industry  has  been  recently  emerged  as  a  promis- 
ing  technique  for  providing  cost-effective  and  process-eﬃcient 
route for improved biodiesel production. The key concept to ex- 
ploit nanomaterials as catalysts in the biodiesel industry is to ap- 
ply green-catalytic chemistry and engineering technologies in the 
search  for  environmentally  sustainable  energy  sources  [135, 136] . 
The promising features of nanocatalysts include high stability, ac- 
tivity,  reusability,  surface:volume  ratio,  and  resistance  to  saponi- 
ﬁcation  [137] ,  which  result  in  relatively  higher  biodiesel  yield. 
Numerous nanocatalysts have been used for biodiesel production 
from  different  feedstocks  including  FOG  ( Table  5 ).  However,  less 
studies were performed on evaluating the eﬃciency of nanocata- 
lysts to reduce FFAs content as a pretreatment. 

3 ) 

3 O 

In addition to the studies presented in Table 5 , nanocatalyst ap- 
plication for conversion of a variety of feedstocks showed promis- 
ing  results.  To  mention  few,  Wong  et  al.  [146]  evaluated  nano- 
CaO  within  a  particle  size  30–100  nm  as  a  catalyst  for  transes- 
teriﬁcation  of  the  Chinese  tallow  seed  oil.  Results  showed  96% 
biodiesel  yield  using  4  wt%  catalyst  at  65  °C  and  methanol:oil 
ratio  of  12:1  for  2.5  h.  Sunﬂower  oil  was  transesteriﬁed  with 
Cs/Al/Fe 
4 nanocatalyst (30–35 nm) and showed 94.8% biodiesel 
yield  after  2  h  reaction  time  at  methanol:oil  ratio  of  14:1  and 
58  °C  [147] .  In  microalgae,  transesteriﬁcation  of  lipids  from  the 
chlorophyte Nannochloropsis sp. with Ca(OCH 
2 (3 wt%) achieved 
99% biodiesel yield [145] . Transesteriﬁcation of FFAs-rich FOG was 
also evaluated for direct biodiesel production ( Table 5 ). Tahvildari 
et al. [139] studied the conversion of yellow grease into biodiesel 
through transesteriﬁcation using nano-MgO, nano-CaO, and  their 
mixtures. A FAMEs yield of 94.3% was obtained at 7:1 methanol:oil 
ratio  using  a  mixture  of  0.5  g  nano  MgO  and  0.7  g  nano-CaO 
for  6  h.  In  another  study,  sulfated  zirconia  nanoparticles  doped 
with manganese sulfate was used as a catalyst for the transester- 
iﬁcation of yellow grease with FFAs content of 17.5% at the reac- 
tion conditions of 180 °C, 600 rpm, 3 wt% nanocatalyst and 20:1 
methanol:oil  ratio  which  resulted  in  96.5%  biodiesel  yield  [148] . 
The relatively higher methanol:oil ratio applied in that study (20:1) 
was attributed to the higher FFAs content in FOG. Similarly, the use 
of  magnetic  solid  acid  nanocatalyst  (SO 
2 )  for  conver- 
sion of yellow grease into biodiesel ( Table 5 ) achieved 96% FAMEs 
yield [129] . 

4 /Fe–Al–TiO 

Nowadays, innovative ideas for nanocatalyst synthesis and ap- 
plication  in  biodiesel  production  are  being  carried  out.  For  in- 
stance, Krishnamurthy et al. [149] investigated the effect of snail 
shell CaO-synthesized nanocatalyst at a particle size range of 2–
40 nm on biodiesel production from dairy waste scum and Hyd- 
nocarpus wightiana oil. Results showed a biodiesel yield of 96.9% 
and 98.9% from the two studied feedstocks, respectively, at rela- 
tively lower catalyst dose of < 0.9 wt%. Fig. 7 A summarizes the es- 
teriﬁcation and transesteriﬁcation reactions of FOG constituents for 
FAMEs formation. Introducing Si/Ce as a nanocatalyst into the re- 
action enhanced the conversion rate of waste cooking oil extraor- 
dinarily ( Fig. 7 B) [150] . The conversion was purely concentration-

dependent, in which increasing the molar ratio of Si/Ce up to 10 
enhanced  the  conversion  rate  up  to  94.3%,  and  therefore,  it  is 
suggested as a potential nanocatalyst for FOG conversion. Overall, 
different nanocatalysts showed high conversion eﬃciency of FOG, 
where biodiesel yield is strongly dependent on the type of catalyst. 
Application of nanomaterials for FOG’s biodiesel production could 
sustain  and  provide  a  clean  route  for  enhanced  energy  recovery 
from lipidic wastes. 

4.4. Biological conversion 

Biological  conversion  involves  application  of  microorganisms 
that are capable to utilize FFAs for biomass production or to con- 
vert glycerides into FFAs enzymatically ( Fig. 8 ). The advantages of 
using  microorganisms  and/or  their  enzyme  extracts  include  low 
energy  consumption,  minimizing  the  chemical  consumption,  re- 
duced inorganic pollutant byproducts, and valuable biomass pro- 

duction  that  can  be  utilized  further  as  a  biofuel  feedstock.  Ac- 
cording to Fig. 8 , FOG containing mainly glycerides and FFAs can 
be processed by microbial cells directly or after encapsulation to 
be converted into biodiesel. In addition, lipases may be extracted 
from  microbes  and  applied  to  convert  FOG  glycerides  into  FFAs, 
followed by esteriﬁcation to form biodiesel. Thus, feedstock with 
high FFAs content was reported to be eﬃciently used for lipase- 
catalyzed process [151] . Lipases can be reused without interstage 
washing and thereby reduces freshwater consumption and waste 
generation [152] . In addition, lipase application has many environ- 
mental and economic advantages such as lower energy consump- 
tion, lower post-treatment cost, and a broader feedstock speciﬁcity 
than chemical catalytic processes [153] . These features speciﬁcally 
open great space for biodiesel production through biological and 
enzymatic  conversion  of  FFAs-rich  FOG.  In  that  context,  lipases 
from immobilized Candida sp. were successfully used for produc- 
ing biodiesel from yellow grease and recorded a maximum conver-

sion eﬃciency of 91% [154] . In addition, ultrasonic enzymatic con- 
version of yellow grease using Novozyme 435 lipase and dimethyl 
carbonate  (DMC)  resulted  in  86.61%  biodiesel  yield  [155] .  Enzy- 
matic transesteriﬁcation of yellow grease using immobilized Rhizo- 
pus oryzae lipase resulted in maximum FAMEs yield of 90% under 
the optimized conditions (40 °C, methanol:oil ratio of 4:1, immobi- 
lized lipase-to-oils ratio of 30% at 1 atm pressure for 30 h) [156] . It 
is noteworthy to mention that enzymatic conversion requires lower 
alcohol:FFAs  ratio  comparing  to  acid  esteriﬁcation  ( Section  4.1 ). 
Concerning  direct  application  of  microbial  cells,  microorganisms 
can be grown on the FFAs-rich FOG for enhanced biomass produc- 
tion [157, 158] . The residual glycerides as well as lipids extracted 
from the produced biomass can be converted through transester- 
iﬁcation  into  biodiesel  ( Fig.  8 ).  In  that  context,  Ying  and  Chen 
[159]  investigated  the  potential  of  lipase-producing  Bacillus  sub- 
tilis encapsulated within a net of hydrophobic carrier with mag- 
netic particles (Fe 
4 ) for transesteriﬁcation of yellow grease. The 
produced  magnetic  cell  biocatalyst  (MCB)  showed  better  disper- 

3 O 

sion  during  transesteriﬁcation  and  ease  separation  from  the  re- 
action mixture by subjecting to an external magnetic ﬁeld. A re- 
cent study performed an alternative route for producing biodiesel 
from FFAs-rich sludge palm oil through two steps fatty acid extrac- 
tion followed by enzymatic esteriﬁcation [160] . FFAs from oil were 
extracted through saponiﬁcation reaction, then the extracted FFAs 
were  converted  into  FAMEs  through  esteriﬁcation  catalyzed  by 
Rhizopus  oryzae  lipase  immobilized  on  alginate-polyvinyl  alcohol 
(APVA) beads. Results showed a highest FAMEs yield of 91.30% un- 
der optimum conditions of 3:1 methanol:FFAs at 40 °C. Moreover, 
MCB can be easily recovered with stability of enzymatic activity. 
Although  biological  conversion  showed  promising  results  in  lab- 
scale trials, the high cost related to the required sterilization con- 
ditions and the long pretreatment time (10–14 days) limit its appli- 
cation in commercial-scales. Alternatively, cultivation of oleaginous 
microbes on FOG for enhanced biomass production might provide 
economical  solution  for  the  aforementioned  issues  as  discussed 
in Section 6.3 .

4.5. Glycerolysis 

An alternative pretreatment method is glycerol re-esteriﬁcation 
or “glycerolysis” that can be successfully employed for FOG con- 
taining  more  than  10%  FFAs  without  using  acid,  methanol  or 
vacuum  stripping  [128]  and,  thereby,  reducing  the  ﬁnal  cost  of 
biodiesel  [161] .  This  reaction  can  be  conducted  by  adding  glyc- 
erin  to  FOG  at  250  °C  to  form  monoacylglycerols  (MAGs),  then 
diacylglycerols  (DAGs)  and  TAGs  are  formed  by  further  reaction 
with glycerol ( Fig. 9 ). The formed glycerides can be converted into 
biodiesel using the standard alkali-transesteriﬁcation [128] . From 
the environmental aspect, the main beneﬁt of this approach is the 
effective recycling of waste glycerol produced from the transester- 
iﬁcation  reaction.  Thus,  glycerolysis  provides  a  practical  solution 
for the two major challenges associated with biodiesel industry in- 
cluding destabilizing price in the global market for glycerin mar- 
ket  and  diﬃculty  in  utilizing  low-cost  FOG  with  high  FFAs  con- 
tent. As shown in Table 6 , glycerolysis could convert up to 99.6% 
3 as a catalyst 
of FFAs in 1 h reaction time at 238 °C using ZnAl 
[161] . In addition, it is effective to reduce the FFAs into a satisfac- 
tory level without using catalyst. Moreover, glycerolysis is eﬃcient 
with FOG containing FFAs content of more than 10%, which pro- 
vides a good technique for pretreatment of brown grease. In that 
context, it showed a relatively high eﬃciency of 85% reduction in 
FFAs of brown grease from wastewater scum (70% FFAs) at 200 °C 
for 120 min [94] . 

2 O 

However, the main challenge of glycerolysis is the required high 
reaction temperature, which is about three-times higher than that 
required for acid esteriﬁcation. By comparing the net energy yield 
for the same capacity of biodiesel unit, glycerolysis might be a pre- 
ferred  route  in  terms  of  lower  operational and  capital costs,  es- 
pecially  for  FFAs-rich  feedstocks.  For  example,  biodiesel  produc- 
tion through glycerolysis-pretreated FOG required lesser energy in- 
put  (0.251  MJ  kg −1  biodiesel)  than  that  of  the  traditional  route 
(0.534  MJ  kg −1  biodiesel)  [128] .  Further  reduction  of  energy  in- 
put  or  effective  heat  recycling  could  enhance  the  process  econ- 
omy. Therefore, an integrated approach of recycling the heat gener- 
ated from glycerolysis in the distillation step of acid esteriﬁcation 

for methanol recovery might enhance the total energy output at a 
lower cost (as discussed later in Section 6 ). 

4.6. Supercritical esteriﬁcation of FOG 

Supercritical esteriﬁcation (SCE) is a catalyst-free process (CF- 
SCE) in which alcohol (usually methanol) is used under supercriti- 
cal conditions of pressure and heat. Under supercritical conditions, 
methanol itself plays the role of the catalyst due to its high solu- 
bility/dispersion, transitioning the reaction towards a rate-limiting 
instead of a solubility-limiting reaction [170] . Both FFAs and glyc- 
erides react easily with alcohol under supercritical conditions, so 
there is no need to separate these components and no pretreat- 
ment is required. At the critical temperature and pressure (about 
40 0  °C  and  20 0 bar,  respectively),  methanol  acts  as  a  non-polar 
solvent  and  becomes  soluble  to  dissolve  oil  uniformly.  However, 
the eﬃciency of FFAs conversion under supercritical conditions is 
inﬂuenced by various reaction conditions such as residence time, 
alcohol:FFAs ratio and mixing speed [170, 171] . Biodiesel recovery 
from yellow grease via CF-SCE was evaluated by Tan et al. [172] , 
and a maximum of 80% FAMEs yield was reported for both raw 
and reﬁned oils. Application of in situ conversion for spent coffee 
grounds  under  a  CF-SCE  (5:1  methanol:oil  ratio,  9  MPa,  270  °C, 
20 min) showed a yield of 86.3 wt% [173] . The FAMEs yield in- 
creased up to 95.3% by application of SCE for yellow grease with 
a relatively low water and FFAs contents (0.2% and 5.67%, respec- 
tively) using CO 
2 as a co-solvent at 271.1 °C, 23.1 MPa for 20.4 min 
[95] . In general, SCE is eco-friendly and has the potential to over- 
come  the  technical  challenges  for  conversion  of  high  FFAs  feed- 
stocks,  such  as  brown  grease,  which  are  not  feasible  to  be  pro- 
cessed by the conventional single-step or two-step esteriﬁcation. 
However, this technique is energy intensive (an estimated 2407 kW 
are required to produce 10 4  tons of biodiesel) [174] , which esca- 
lates the ﬁnal cost of the biodiesel produced, hence, it is consid- 
ered as infeasible process for large-scale biodiesel production. 

In order to improve the process economy, a catalyst-free two- 
step supercritical conversion (CF-TS-SCC) was developed. In CF-TS- 
SCC, FOG-glycerides are hydrolyzed into glycerol and FFAs, then the 
latter is subsequently converted to FAMEs under supercritical con-

ditions in the presence of methanol ( Fig. 10 ) [175] . In this reaction, 
the  dissolved  FFAs  increase  the  acidity  of  supercritical  methanol 
and act as an indigenous acid catalyst that increases the reaction 
rate.  CF-TS-SCC  has  the  ability  to  reduce  the  operating  costs  of 
biodiesel production due to rapid reaction rates, as well as recov- 
ery of high-quality biodiesel and glycerol because of the purity of 
the inputs [176] . Additionally, Japanese scientists developed an al- 
ternative catalyst-free single-step supercritical conversion (CF-SS- 
SCC) using methyl acetate instead of methanol [177] . In CF-SS-SCC, 
triacetin is produced as a byproduct with FAMEs, instead of the 
glycerol ( Fig. 10 ). Triacetin is a valuable fuel additive which results 
in simpliﬁed downstream processes as compared to conventional 
catalytic reactions, while the mixture of FAMEs and triacetin can 
be utilized as upgraded biodiesel. In this aspect, the products mass 
ratio (FAMEs:triacetin) was about 4:1 wt% and eventually the to- 
tal theoretical weight of biodiesel mixture (FAMEs and triacetin) 
was 125%, compared to 100% for FAMEs only [ [172], [178] ]. Over- 
all, supercritical esteriﬁcation is receiving a great attention recently 
as a new technology towards maximizing the use of low-quality 
feedstocks  with  high  FFAs  content  including  FOG.  However,  fur- 
ther  studies  concerning  the  process  economy  and  life  cycle  as- 
sessment  are  required.  In  addition,  exploring  novel  supercritical 
reagents makes the overall process highly lucrative. 

4.7. Simultaneous conversion of FOG into biodiesel 

Direct in situ transesteriﬁcation refers to simultaneous conver- 
sion of FOG into biodiesel that was recently discussed as an al- 
ternative route to overcome the two-step conversion. The simul- 
taneous  conversion  involves  the  reagents, catalyst  and  oil  mixed 
directly without prior extraction [ [23], [173] ]. The skipping of the 
extraction step results in signiﬁcant reduction in the energy con- 
sumption and total cost, as well as reduction of physical footprint 
[179] . Few studies have been performed to explore the feasibility 
of biodiesel production through applying in situ transesteriﬁcation 
[ [42], [180] ]. According to the early investigation conducted by Tu 
[180] , the optimum operating conditions for in situ transesteriﬁca- 
4 and 10:1 methanol:FOG at 65 °C for 
tion of FOG were 20% H 
7 h, under which 85.43% of FOG in the raw sewer grease was con- 
verted to biodiesel. Later, a new method for waste grease extrac- 
tion (WGE) was developed, where yellow grease can be mixed with 
the raw sewer grease (3.15:1, w/w ) under 70 °C for 240 min [181] . 
During  the  process,  FOG  in  the  sewer  grease  was  removed  into 
the liquid yellow grease phase with about 100% extraction rate. Af- 
ter FOG extraction, solid and liquid phases were separated in the 
lower phase, while FOG forms the upper layer ( Fig. 11 ). The ex- 
traction resulted in increment of FFAs from 2.68 wt% in the yellow

directly into biodiesel by in situ transesteriﬁcation. Using WGE for 
in  situ  conversion  of  FOG  into  biodiesel  has  several  advantages 
comparing  to  the  conventional  methods.  WGE  avoids  the  drying 
of raw sewer grease that is necessary for many other conversion 
techniques including in situ transesteriﬁcation. In addition, using 
yellow grease for WGE is cost-effective when compared with other 
techniques  used  for  FOG  separation  from  sewer  grease,  such  as 
centrifugation. In situ transesteriﬁcation contains fewer steps com- 
paring to other conversion methods and can achieve satisfactory 
results  with  FFAs-rich  feedstocks.  Therefore,  it  might  reduce  the 
complexity and capital investment of FOG conventional conversion.

However, methanol and H

most of the methanol is recovered after conversion. Therefore, fu- 
ture research is needed in order to improve WGE and in situ trans- 
esteriﬁcation  through  enhancement  of  extraction  and  conversion 
rates, respectively.

5. Economic feasibility and environmental aspects 

5.1. Characteristics of FOG-derived biodiesel 

Quantitative yield of biodiesel is a key aspect in determining 
the  process  economy  and  commercialization,  which  entirely  de- 
pends upon the characteristics of FOG. The high FFAs and water 
content  in  FOG  reduce  the  conversion  eﬃciency,  which  requires 
extensive pretreatments as discussed previously. Fig. 12 shows a 

comparison between biodiesel yields from FOG with other avail- 
able feedstocks. The calculated average of biodiesel yield from FOG 
showed the lowest value between other feedstocks. The relation- 
ship  between  FFAs  level  and  the  eﬃciency  of  transesteriﬁcation 
during  acid-catalyzed  biodiesel  production  was  previously  inves- 
tigated  [182] ,  in which palmitic  acid as  FFAs  was  added to  soy- 
bean  oil  at  different  ratios.  The  conversion  rate  of  oil  mixtures 
to biodiesel decreased from 90.5% to 58.8% as the FFAs level in- 
creased  from  5%  to  33%.  However,  optimization  of  reaction  con- 
ditions signiﬁcantly increased the yield up to 98%, which is com- 
parable to the yield obtained from other widely used feedstocks 
such as soybean and rapeseed oil ( Fig. 12 ). Thus, exploring new 
eco-friendly methods for effective pretreatment and enhancing the 
biodiesel yield is urgently needed to achieve the commercialization 
of FOG-biodiesel production. In addition, designing a cost-effective 
transesteriﬁcation reactor providing crucial parameter control suit- 
able for FOG conversion is essential. Different reactors geometries 
including rotating reactors, tubular/plug-ﬂow reactors, microwave 
reactors, cavitation reactors, and simultaneous reaction-separation 
reactors were recently discussed by Tabatabaei et al. [88] . Thus, the 
present review focused mainly on FOG composition and its impact 
on biodiesel production eﬃciency and characteristics. 

In  addition  to  the  yield,  qualitative  properties  (physical  and 
chemical) of  FOG  signiﬁcantly controls  the transesteriﬁcation re- 
action and the ﬁnal fuel properties. Thus, studying FOG proﬁle and 
composition is beneﬁcial to achieve potential biodiesel character- 
istics. As an alternative fuel, biodiesel possesses properties ﬁt for 
the operation of diesel engines. In that context, many studies re-

ported that the characteristics of biodiesel produced from different 
feedstocks are comparable to those of diesel fuel and international 
standards,  which  can  be  conﬁrmed  from  the  data  presented  in 
Table 7 . In recent decades, biodiesel standards and quality control 
have been developed worldwide to assure a reliable and consistent 
fuel supply. In order to have a biodiesel that meets the require- 
ments of engine performance, biodiesel characteristics must meet 
the speciﬁcations of international standards, such as American So- 
ciety of Testing and Materials [184] and European standards [185] . 
FOG  composition  and  nature  is  site-dependent  and  it  showed  a 
wide variation from different sites (see Tables 1 and 2 ). Some un- 
desired physical properties of FOG, such as the strong odor, can 
be mitigated during the pretreatment stages, which is essential to 
remove what could be perceived as potential nuisances. However, 
chemical properties, mainly fatty acid proﬁle, and the conversion 
method signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the biodiesel characteristics [186] . 

Fatty  acids  in  the  feedstock  determine  many  important  fuel 
properties,  as  the  biodiesel  mainly  contains  fatty  acid  esters.  In 
a previous study, Marx and Venter [187] evaluated biodiesel pro- 
duction from waste process grease (WPG) through two routes, the 
conventional  two-step  alkaline  catalyzed  transesteriﬁcation  (R1) 
and  modiﬁcation  of  WPG  followed  by  puriﬁcation  using  solid 
phase extraction (R2). Results concluded that biodiesel produced 
from the conventional two-step transesteriﬁcation did not comply 
the national standards due to high sulfur and total glycerol con- 
tent ( Table 7 ). The high sulfur level conﬁrms the presence of emul- 
siﬁers  in  the  biodiesel,  while  the  presence  of  glycerin  is  caused 
mainly by incomplete conversion during transesteriﬁcation process 
which can cause engine damage and results in deposit formation in 
the combustion chamber. It was conﬁrmed by various authors (e.g. 
[188–190] ) that lower sulfur content of FOG-biodiesel is the reason 
for signiﬁcant low SO x  emissions. In addition, biodiesel produced 
from R1 showed very low ﬂash point value of 32 °C which was 
much lower than that recommended by American and European 
standards. On the other hand, the characteristics of biodiesel from 
R2 complied the international speciﬁcations ( Table 7 ). An orthogo- 
nal analysis was performed to study the optimum reaction condi- 
tions for transesteriﬁcation of yellow grease [34] , which conﬁrmed 
that all comparable biodiesel characteristics under optimized con- 
ditions  met  the  international  standards  ( Table  7 ).  These  results 
conﬁrm that selection and optimization of a suitable FOG pretreat- 
ment and conversion method is a crucial step to obtain satisfac- 
tory biodiesel characteristics. From data presented in Table 7 , FOG- 
biodiesel showed higher ﬂash point than diesel, which has a bene- 
ﬁcial role from the safety aspect as it identiﬁes the lowest temper- 
ature point at which the fuel can ignite in the air. Moreover, FOG- 
biodiesel showed higher cetane number (up to 74.7) than diesel 
(49–52),  edible  oil-biodiesel  (up  to  46.7)  or  microalgae-biodiesel 
(up  to  56.6).  Ignition  quality  of  the  fuel  is  correlated  to  cetane 
number  which  depends  on  the  saturation  degree  of  fatty  acids, 
i.e. the lower unsaturation, the higher cetane number, and faster 
fuel burns [186] . In addition, higher cetane number results in lower 
emissions of unburned hydrocarbons (HCs), CO, NO x and SO x , re- 
duces the combustion noise, produces higher power, and has better 
cold start property [191] . In that context, Meng et al. [34] evaluated 
the impact of FOG-biodiesel on engine exhaust emissions. Results 
conﬁrmed the normal dynamical performance of engine without 
any modiﬁcation to its structure. In addition, B20 (20% of reﬁned 
biodiesel blended with diesel) signiﬁcantly reduced carbon monox- 
ide  (CO),  HCs  and  total  particles  emissions  by  18.6%,  26.7%  and 
20.58%, respectively, compared to fossil diesel as a reference fuel. 
Among different estimated characteristics, the higher heating value 
of FOG-derived biodiesel are a bit lower compared to diesel due to 
its higher viscosity ( Table 7 ), which is in accordance with previous 
reports [183, 192, 193] . Overall, most of FOG-derived biodiesel fuels 
meet every property of conventional diesel fuel as well as the in-

5.2. Potential of FOG-biodiesel commercialization 

The economy of biodiesel production relies mainly on the feed- 
stock and the materials used for fatty acids conversion into fatty 
acid esters. The proﬁtability of biodiesel economy is highly sensi- 
tive to the feedstock cost, accounting for 70–80% of the total pro- 
duction cost [198] . In addition to cost, feedstock availability and 
sustainability represent a serious concern. Therefore, research has 
been broadened on the selection of cost-effective, sustainable, and 
non-edible raw material for biodiesel production. The current cost 
of  biodiesel  from  different  feedstocks  is  still  much  higher  (over 
US$  0.50  per  liter)  than  the  conventional  diesel  (US$  0.35  per 
liter), which was estimated to triple in developing countries [183] . 
Hence, extensive research on new cost-effective feedstocks is re- 
quired  along  with  effort s  and  policies  from  the  governments  to 
make biodiesel economically feasible. 

By  2012,  there  were  30  registered  biodiesel  producers  in  UK 
with  the  capacity  to  process  250  million  liters  of  yellow  grease 
annually [199] . In addition, 0.5% of biodiesel was produced from 
waste  cooking  oil  in  Brazil  during  2015  [200] .  According  to  the 
European  Biomass  Industry  Association  [43] ,  biodiesel  produced 
from FOG could replace 1.5% of the total diesel fuel in the Euro- 
pean Union (EU-28) consumption, estimated by 6.79 × 10 4  mil- 
lion gallons of EU-28 in 2016 [201] . In addition, FOG-biodiesel has 
the potential to replace 26.7% of the total biodiesel produced in 
EU.  In  2018,  3815.2  million  gallons  of  biodiesel  were  produced 
from different feedstocks, with 19.8% produced from yellow grease 
( Fig. 13 ). In US, a grease trap waste (GTW) average of 11,0 0 0 kg 
per restaurant is produced annually with up to 40% lipid content 
[202] . The price of yellow grease ranges between US$ 0.09–0.20 
per pound, while brown grease is as cheaper as US$ 0.01–0.03 [30] . 
According to the US Department of Agriculture, greases and animal 
fats together represent one-third of the US total fats and oils pro- 
duction, while soybean oil occupies more than half of US produc- 
tion. However, yellow and brown grease are often cited as a poten- 
tial feedstock for biodiesel due to the cheaper price and very low 
value for having high FFAs content. It is estimated that over 400 
million gallons of biodiesel could be produced in the US from GTW 
annually  [203] ,  which  is  about  31.5%  of  the  total  biodiesel  pro- 
duced in 2014 [180] . However, FOG-biodiesel cost and the conse- 
quent environmental impacts are essential factors for policy mak- 
ers and industrial sectors to be considered. 

5.2.1. Cost analysis 

The  cost  of  the  produced  biodiesel  should  be  comparable  to 
petroleum  diesel  which  is  less  expensive  and  widely  affordable 
at present. The net FOG-biodiesel yield varies based on the feed- 
stock composition, pretreatment, and conversion method. To com- 
pete petroleum diesel, the feedstock cost plays the main role [204] , 
and estimation of the maximum acceptable price of FOG can be 
used to evaluate the competitiveness. Based on the amount of FOG 
equivalent to provide the energy content in a gallon of fossil diesel, 
the maximal acceptable price of FOG as a biodiesel feedstock ( P 
fog , 
US$  ton −1 )  should  be  competitive  to  the  petroleum  diesel  price 
diesel , US$ gallon −1 ). Considering that FOG used for biodiesel pro- 
( P 
duction has different yields ( y ), the P 
fog can be calculated from Eq. 
(5) ; 

f og = P 
P 

diesel ÷ E 
diesel 
f og × y 
E 

(5) 

where  E 
diesel 
f og ×y  represents the amount of FOG equivalent to the en- 
E 
diesel , ≈146.6 MJ [205] ), and 
ergy content in one gallon of diesel ( E

Fig. 13.  The sales of diesel fuel in the European Union (EU-28) in 2016 by member state (columns). The green line indicates the current biodiesel production from different 
feedstocks, while red line indicates the potential of FOG-biodiesel to replace EU-28. Based on the data from [201] . (For interpretation of the references to color in this ﬁgure 
legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) 

fog  is  the  energy  content  of  FOG-biodiesel  ( ≈40,0 0 0  MJ  ton −1 
E 
[100] ). It is important to state that these calculations have not con- 
sidered any the possible additional income of different routes of 
energy production from FOG by other reﬁning processes. 

The  diesel  price  in  2011–2014  showed  signiﬁcant  increase  of 
about US$ 3.9 per gallon which was 1.6-fold higher than the price 
in  20 0 0  ( Fig.  14 A).  In  2019,  the  price  was  one-fold  higher  than 
that in 20 0 0. According to Eq. 5 , the acceptable price of FOG as 
a feedstock for biodiesel at different diesel prices scenarios of up 
to US$ 5 per gallon is represented in Fig. 14 B. It can be noticed 
that  increasing  the  biodiesel  yield  as  well  as  the  current  diesel 
price  allow  higher  acceptable  FOG  price.  Due  to  the  increase  in 
diesel price, the acceptable price of FOG with 95% yield increased 
from US$ 386 ton −1 in 20 0 0 to US$ 702 ton −1 in 2015 ( Fig. 14 B). 
However,  reduction  of  yield  to  80%,  as  in  case  of  brown  grease, 
resulted in reduction of the acceptable price to US$ 673 ton −1 in 

2019. In order to compete with conventional diesel at the current 
diesel  price  of  US$  3.08  per  gallon  (according  to  US  Energy  In- 
formation Administration in 23 th September 2019, http://www.eia. 
gov/petroleum/gasdiesel ),  the  cost  of  FOG  at  a  biodiesel  yield  of 
95% should be no more than US$ 799 per gallon ( Fig. 14 B). How- 
ever, the price of yellow and brown grease is about US$ 412 ton −1 
and US$ 224 ton −1 , respectively [206] , which conﬁrms that FOG 
is more competitive as a biodiesel feedstock than other lipid-rich 
sources. In agreement with the present estimations, Canakci and 
Van Gerpen [207] constructed a 50-gallon pilot plant to produce 
biodiesel from different FFAs-rich feedstocks in comparison with 
soybean oil as a standard. Biodiesel production from yellow grease 
and  brown  grease  containing  9%  and  40%  of  FFAs,  respectively, 
showed  lower  consumable  baseline  cost  for  (US$  1.103  and  US$ 
0.837  per  gallon,  respectively)  than  soybean  (US$  1.584  per  gal- 
lon), which was primarily attributed to the lower feedstock cost.

A part from feedstock cost, current FOG-derived biodiesel produc- 
tion cost is still far away from the acceptable ranges due to the 
high  cost  of  pretreatment  and  conversion  process.  For  example, 
Demirbas [208] reported that biodiesel production from municipal 
sewage sludge will cost US$ 3.11 gallon −1 . According to the study 
of Marx and Venter [187] in 2014, the cost of biodiesel production 
form WPG would be competitive to diesel if the petroleum price 
rises above US$ 130 barrel −1 (i.e. US$ 3.1 gallon −1 ). Based on such 
prediction, it’s the time to focus on FOG biodiesel as a strong com- 
petitive fuel to the conventional diesel with a current price around 
US$ 3.1 gallon −1 . By aggregating the above discussions and by con- 
sidering the issues such as decrease in feedstock availability, con- 
tinuous rise in crude oil prices, and food-versus-fuel debate, FOG 
will deﬁnitely arise as a highly valuable biodiesel feedstock in near 
future. 

5.2.2. Environmental impact 

Evaluation of the environmental impact of biodiesel from dif- 
ferent feedstocks as an alternative to conventional diesel helps in 
making decision and implementing the proper measures for adopt- 
ing a sustainable alternative. Energy demand, emissions and global 
warming impact are the most common issues for eﬃcient evalua- 
tion of an energy system from the environmental aspect. According 
to the European waste catalogue and hazardous waste list [210] , 
FOG residuals collected from wastewater treatment processes need 
to be considered as a special waste for eﬃcient and safe manage- 
ment [Code 19-08-09]. FOG from WWTPs is deﬁned as ‘‘Grease and 
Oil Mixture from Oil/Water Separation containing only edible oil 
and fats’’ (GOMOWS) which requires appropriate treatment before 
disposal. Sludge incineration leads to hazardous emissions (diox- 
ins and heavy metals) that need further treatment, which increases 
the process cost, and this explains why the US halted further ex- 
pansion of waste incineration since late 20 th century [211, 212] . In 
addition, landﬁll leads to accumulation of toxic substances in the 
terrestrial  environment  and  more  dwindling  of  spaces  occur  for 
constructing  new  landﬁlls  [211, 213] .  Therefore,  effective  valoriza- 
tion of FOG through converting it into biofuel would nullify its dis- 
posal cost and generates additional net proﬁt. 

Hot centrifugation of GOMOWS helps to separate it into differ- 
ent phases; (i) aqueous phase that can be recycled to the WWTPs, 
(ii) light solids containing mixture of cellulosic residue and ﬁbers 
that are treatable as a wastewater sludge and can be utilized for 
biogas  production,  and  (iii)  a  fatty  phase  that  can  be  converted 
into  biodiesel  [100] .  Pastore  et  al.  [100]  conﬁrmed  that  applica- 
tion  of  centrifugation  leads  to  a  major  reduction  in  the  cost  of 
GOMOWS disposal from WWTPs (120–240 Euro per metric ton). 
Moreover, about 100 kg of FAMEs could be produced at a lower 
price compared to wastewater sewage sludge [214] , due to waive 
the required preliminary drying which occupies more than a half 
of the total estimated costs of wastewater sewage sludge conver- 
sion.  Despite  the  beneﬁts  associated  with  waste  sludge  utiliza- 
tion for FAMEs production, the issues related to high-water con- 
tent need to be addressed which limits the transesteriﬁcation re- 
action. Economic analysis for biodiesel production from dried and 
wet wastewater sludge was previously studied and about 75.8% re- 
duction in the total cost was estimated in case of dried sludge [45] . 
The higher cost of wet transesteriﬁcation was mainly attributed to 
the higher solvent consumption. However, sludge drying was re- 
ported  as  a  costly  pretreatment  step  due  to  higher  energy  con- 
sumption  when  compared  to  other  feedstocks  [16, 215] .  For  ev- 
ery ton of dried sludge, an estimated energy consumption of 9.1 
GJ is required, which represents about 2.5 × 10 3  kW h electricity 
equivalent [215] . Such electricity usage again exerts counter effect 
on resource consumption like fossil usage for electricity generation 
and eventually results in environmental deterioration. Thus, future 

sludge utilization for biodiesel production should endeavor to max- 
imize FOG recovery with minimal energy consumption. 

Environmental assessment of biodiesel produced from agricul- 
tural crops (palm oil, soybean oil, rapeseed) conﬁrmed a signiﬁ- 
cant reduction in GHGs emissions by 41–78% below that of fossil 
diesel [216–218] . The environmental impacts of different biodiesel 
produced from FFAs-rich wastes were compared [218] , which con- 
ﬁrmed that the GHGs emissions of biodiesel produced from wastes 
are 10–35% lower than soybean biodiesel. Recently, life cycle as- 
sessment  of  biodiesel  production  from  waste  cooking  oil  using 
chicken eggshell-derived CaO as a heterogenous catalyst was rec- 
ognized as more ecofriendly process than using Jatropha oil [219] . 
In addition, some environmental parameters of biodiesel produced 
from  different  FFAs-rich  feedstocks  in  comparison  with  soybean 
and rapeseed as standard biodiesel feedstocks were evaluated at 
estimated  energy  supply  of  1  GJ  [218] .  Fig.  15  summarizes  the 
studied parameters which include cumulative non-renewable en- 
ergy  demand  (CNED),  global  warming  (GW),  ozone  layer  deple- 
tion (OLD), acidiﬁcation (AF) and eutrophication (EP). Biodiesel fu- 
els from FFAs-rich feedstocks, except sewage sludge, showed lower 
impacts of CNED than rapeseed, recording the minimum value of 
314.3  MJ  eq  for  the  yellow  grease  ( Fig.  15 A).  The  highest  CNED 
of 800.0 MJ eq was recorded with sewage sludge, which conﬁrms 
that GOMOWS conversion to biodiesel is energy intensive compar- 
ing to other feedstocks. Concerning the GW and OLD, yellow grease 
2 eq and 2.04 × 10 −6 kg 
showed the minimum values (16.9 kg CO 
CFC eq, respectively) in comparison to all the studied feedstocks 
( Fig. 15 B). Interestingly, all studied alternative FFAs-rich feedstocks 
showed lower AF and EP than those of standard feedstocks ( Fig. 
15 C), which conﬁrms lower SO x and NO x emission rates. These re- 
sults conﬁrmed that rapeseed-derived biodiesel is not appropriate 
because of both high energy demand and global warming impact. 
Considering the competition within food markets, soybean is not 
the  best  choice  as  a  biodiesel  feedstock,  even  with  the  promis- 
ing results of low energy demand and emissions. Overall, the four 
tested alternative biodiesel feedstocks showed better environmen- 
tal proﬁle for most of the studied parameters than the standard 
feedstocks.  Amongst,  yellow  grease  can  be  recommended  as  the 
most promising feedstock from the environmental aspect. In a re- 
cent study, comparative water footprint (WF) proﬁle was evaluated 
for  four  biodiesel  feedstocks  including  soya,  palm,  rapeseed  and 
waste cooking oil [220] . The study concluded that oil from rape- 
seed cultivated in Spain has the highest water scarcity footprint 
due to the higher water consumption. It also showed higher im- 
pacts of freshwater and human toxicity due to the usage of higher 
quantity of pesticide during cultivation. However, waste cooking oil 
as a feedstock for biodiesel production showed the lowest impact 
on WF as it is obviously apparent that there is no water consump- 
tion for generating FOG. Overall, a “well-to-wheels ” is a promising 
concept to utilize FOG as an alternative biodiesel feedstock in or- 
der to replace the conventional diesel. However, future research is 
required to reduce the energy demand and enhance the yield of 
FOG conversion. 

6. Future perspectives 

Recent research in waste management highlighted other poten- 
tial utilization routes for FOG wastes of diversiﬁed nature which is 
constantly been explored to produce numerous value-added prod- 
ucts apart from energy. FOG valorization to high value biopolymers 
such as polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) and biodegradable plastics 
was studied in order to increase the economic beneﬁt [221–223] . 
Cultivation of certain bacterial species on several renewable feed- 
stocks, including FOG, could produce PHAs. The crude glycerol pro- 
duced as a byproduct from FOG transesteriﬁcation can be used as 
a valuable raw material for biopolymer generation or to enhance

the biodiesel production from microalgae [224–226] . The present 
section aims to summarize the suggested routes to improve FOG 
utilization in biodiesel production through eﬃcient utilization of 
brown  grease,  integrated  approach  of  energy  recovery,  and  co- 
esteriﬁcation of FOG with other lipids. 

6.1. Eﬃcient utilization of brown grease 

Despite the available research reports on FOG deposit forma- 
tion in sewer collection systems and the possible economic bene- 
ﬁts of FOG recycling, there are many challenges to be solved and 
hypotheses  to  be  tested.  Many  studies  conﬁrmed  the  eﬃciency 
of yellow grease as a biodiesel feedstock from environmental and 
economic  aspects.  However,  it  is  reported  that  the  potential  of 

brown  grease  to  produce  biodiesel  (more  than  500  million  gal- 
lons  of  biodiesel  from  GTW  in  US)  is  much  higher  than  that  of 
yellow grease ( ∼55 million gallons) [227] . Due to extremely high 
FFAs content, little research has been carried out on conversion of 
brown grease to biodiesel, and the commercial success is even elu- 
sive for some start-up companies. Therefore, more future research 
should focus on maximizing the utilization and recovery of brown 
grease. 

The ﬁrst stage of GTW-biodiesel processing involves lipid ex- 
traction from a complex and inhomogeneous feedstock ( Fig. 16 ). 
For example, heating and settling of GTW or scum grease eventu- 
ally result in formation of four layers namely brown grease which 
forms the upper lipid layer, ﬂoating solids, wastewater, and sedi- 
ments ( Fig. 16 ). Sediments and ﬂoating solids can be utilized for

anaerobic co-digestion with other feedstocks, while wastewater is 
injected to the secondary treatment tanks at the WWTP, avoiding 
the ﬁrst settling phase. Despite the possible reduction of FFAs from 
high levels as much as 15% to a target level of 1% using alkali cat- 
alyst, the higher FFAs content as in case of brown grease could not 
be directly converted [228, 229] . In addition, the required amounts 
of catalyst and methanol for moderate processing were considered 
to be quite high, which results in elevated cost of the biodiesel. 
A  method that would be suﬃciently  robust to process relatively 

high FFAs mixtures while using reasonable amounts of methanol 
and acid should be applied. It can be achieved using two-step acid 
catalysis process where a substantial reduction in the amount of 
applied acid and methanol can be achieved by increasing the time 
for each step to 60 min [230] . However, it is not usually used by 
the  biodiesel  producers  because  of  the  relatively  longer  reaction 
time and lower yield. Instead, two-step conversion process of acid- 
catalyzed esteriﬁcation pretreatment to convert FFAs to TAGs fol- 
lowed by the traditional alkali-catalyzed transesteriﬁcation can be

used ( Fig. 16 ). For such route, separation of methanol-water mix- 
ture after the pretreatment results in loss of signiﬁcant amount of 
fats and esters [230] . Thus, removal of methanol-water mixture is 
suggested to takes place after the last step of pretreatment in or- 
der to reduce the feedstock loss. However, the water presents in 
the mixture might affect the reaction performance which requires 
a post-treatment to recover fats and esters. Therefore, glyceroly- 
sis  could  be  an  eﬃcient  alternative  pretreatment  method  where 
the glycerol byproduct can be recycled in the process ( Fig. 16 ). Si- 
multaneously, the glycerolysis process offers greater opportunity in 
developing market for glycerin. In addition, the heat used in glyc- 
erolysis can be recycled for menthol recovery during the distilla- 
tion step of acid esteriﬁcation. However, there existing signiﬁcant 
knowledge  gaps  in  glycerolysis  application  in  FFAs  pretreatment 
and  co-esteriﬁcation  of  FOG  for  enhanced  biodiesel  production. 
In addition to glycerolysis for the pretreatment, direct conversion 
of brown grease into biodiesel at supercritical conditions without 

prior pretreatment is recommended as one of the promising ap- 
proaches to enhance biodiesel yield and characteristics. However, 
more studies regarding its feasibility are required to evaluate the 
process economy. 

6.2. Integrated approach of energy recovery 

The challenges of FOG anaerobic co-digestion with different or- 
ganic wastes were previously reviewed by Salama et al. [68] . The 
study conﬁrmed the inhibition of methanogens by LCFAs (C14-C24) 
produced from FOG hydrolysis as the major challenge in anaero- 
bic systems, especially under high lipid content. Accumulation of 
LCFAs decreases cell permeability, changes the cellular morphology, 
and limits the mass transfer within the system [231–233] . For the 
best scenarios, LCFAs at lower concentrations can be degraded into 
short chain fatty acids within 15 days [234] , which increases the 
HRT of the digestion process. Therefore, developing new strategies 
to increase the stability of anaerobic digesters at high FOG load-

ing rates is a crucial concept for enhanced biogas production. In 
addition, biogas generation was reported as less eﬃcient process 
of utilizing the energy content in the FOG when compared with 
biodiesel [180] . After biodiesel production from the lipidic portion 
of FOG, the non-lipidic portion can be used further for biogas pro- 
duction through anaerobic digestion ( Fig. 16 ). Thus, conversion of 
FOG into biodiesel could not replace the anaerobic digestion, rather 
it  complements  the  anaerobic  digester  installations  by  providing 
a faster and signiﬁcantly higher energy production through “FOG 
bioreﬁnery ”. In that regard, a recent study [49] examined the “dual- 
fuel production ” from restaurant GTW by transesteriﬁcation of FOG 
layer and anaerobic co-digestion of the dewatered food waste layer. 
It showed that the total energy produced from 1 L of GTW in a 
dual fuel process (13.4 MJ L −1  GTW) was 39.6% higher than that 
produced from co-digestion only. In addition, anaerobic digestion 
of solids from GTW signiﬁcantly reduced both GHGs emission and 
energy consumption [235] . This could be an eﬃcient approach for 
GTW utilization as it separates the two layers in which the upper 
layer can be used as a biodiesel feedstock, whereas the lower set- 
tled layer can be used for biogas production. Overall, application 
of sequential energy production from FOG will decrease the phys- 
ical footprint of the feedstock and increases the energy yield than 
individual conversion for biodiesel or biogas. 

6.3. Co-esteriﬁcation of FOG with other lipids 

For eﬃcient FFAs pretreatment, dosing regimen recommended 
by NREL report are used currently by most of the industrial sec- 
tors,  which is economically feasible at FFAs levels less than 15% 
[218] . Comparing to fossil diesel, the combustion and higher heat- 
ing  value  of  FOG-derived  biodiesel  are  a  bit  lower  as  discussed 
in Section 5.1 . Therefore, blending of FOG with other lipidic feed- 
stocks containing lower FFAs proportion results in reduction of to- 
tal  FFAs  content  in  the  blend  to  the  desired  levels.  In  line  with 
that, the emissions attributed to 5% blends of waste cooking oil 
(B5-WCO)  biodiesel  fuels  used  in  urban  buses  showed  potential 
reduction of the environmental burdens in ecosystem quality, hu- 
man health, and resources damage categories [236] . Among other 
biodiesel feedstocks, microalgae have been discussed in the recent 
decade  as  one  of  promising  candidates  [79, 189, 237] .  Microalgae 
utilization provides a sustainable approach as it does not rely on 
agricultural land used for food crops with the ability to grow on 
wastewater or seawater [238, 239] . Moreover, microalgae are capa- 
ble of yielding 9.4 × 10 4 L ha −1 of biofuel, compared to 560 L ha −1 
from corn [240] . However, the high cost associated with harvest- 
ing  and  lipid  extraction  is  the  main  disadvantage  of  microalgal 
biofuel technology [241–243] . In addition, algae-derived biodiesel 
may contain some components, such as long-chain alkenones with 
a keto group located at one end of the molecule and unsaturation 
at different positions in the chain, which affect the cold ﬂow [186] . 
In order to make microalgal-biodiesel more feasible and affordable, 
more technological breakthroughs are required. 

Co-esteriﬁcation of microalgal-lipids with FOG results in reduc- 
tion of FFAs content in the blend which is expected to enhance the 
conversion eﬃciency at a lower chemical consumption rate. A re- 
cent study evaluated the blending of biodiesel produced from mi- 
croalgae and FOG [189] . The study conﬁrmed a symbiotic beneﬁts 
of larger FOG availability at low cost for the lesser algal biomass 
with low FFAs. In addition, the blends showed enhanced physio- 
chemical properties ( Table 8 ). The increase in density and viscos- 
ity of the blends due to the presence of microalgal-biodiesel re- 
duced  the  brake  thermal  eﬃciency  (BTE)  and  brake  power  (BP) 
[244, 245] . On the other hand, higher FOG-biodiesel ratios increased 
the caloriﬁc value over microalgal-biodiesel or FOG-biodiesel. Inter- 
estingly, the acid value of all the tested blends were in agreement 
with those recommended by the international standards [184, 185] .

In  addition,  FOG-biodiesel  decreased  the  cloud  point  and  pour 
point  of  the  blend  comparing  to  the  microalgal-biodiesel  which 
is  useful  to  improve  the  biodiesel  suitability  under  colder  con- 
ditions.  In  addition,  the  ﬂash  and  ﬁre  points  of  microalgal-FOG 
biodiesel at all blend ratios showed higher values than those of 
the conventional diesel (58 °C and 66 °C, respectively), which pro- 
vide  safe  storing  of  biodiesel.  Although  microalgal-FOG  biodiesel 
blends showed promising results concerning biodiesel characteris- 
tics, further studies are needed to explore co-esteriﬁcation of algal- 
FOG lipids into biodiesel. By mixing with FOG, microalgal cells sus- 
pended in the liquid medium tend to aggregate and rise with the 
ﬂoating  oil  droplets  and  form  a  layer  at  the  interface  ( Fig.  17 ). 
Application  of  this  strategy  for  microalgal  harvest  could  reduce 
the harvest cost and simultaneously enhance FOG characteristics 
as  a  cost-effective  biodiesel  feedstock.  In  addition,  cultivation  of 
microalgae using low concentrations of FOG as a source of FFAs 
( Fig. 17 ) might enhance the microalgal growth and lipid accumula- 
tion. In that context, enhancement of Chlorella vulgaris growth by 
volatile fatty acids supplementation was reported [246] . The rea- 
sons attributed are that these fatty acids can directly be utilized in 
tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and fatty acid synthesis metabolism. 
Thus, microalgal harvest using FOG or microalgal growth using FOG 
as a supplement for cultivation might light the future of biodiesel 
industry. However, further studies are required in order to validate 
and approve the above hypothesis. 

7. Conclusions 

The present review shed light on conversion of FOG and eluci- 
dated the feasible degree of biodiesel production. Despite the high 
progress in FOG management, the fact that FOG-associated adver- 
sities continue to affect cities is a proof that the current processes 
are inadequate and need further support from individuals, indus- 
trial and governmental sectors. Social media initiatives, public ed- 
ucation campaigns and promoting awareness at school level will 
play a crucial role for reducing FOG-related sewer blockages which 
in turn initiate developing optimum methods for proper collection 
and treatment. 

Although  many  studies  have  been  carried  out  on  FOG  com- 
position, further research is required on proﬁling fatty acid com- 
position in urban environments with establishing an international 
database for different sites. Aggregation of FFAs is a part of FOG 
deposit formation process by binding FOG deposits together. How- 
ever,  limited  reports  talked  about  the  mechanism  and  kinetics 
of  FFAs  aggregation  during  FOG  generation.  Further  research  is 
needed to explain the predominance of FFAs and to determine the 
relationship  between  FFAs  composition  and  FOG  deposits  in  the 
sewer lines. This knowledge is expected to develop models for pre- 
dicting the possible FOG deposition zones. 

Apart from few success initiatives in FOG management, there is 
a potential space for exploring improved innovative technologies 
and  policy  measures  for  development  of  FOG-to-energy  concept. 
Although  the  strategic  approach  of  trap  FOG-to-biodiesel  showed 
an auspicious beginning, there are some major bottlenecks which 
limit  its  commercialization.  The  composition  of  FOG  varies  sub- 
stantially  among  different  sources  which  leads  to  inconsistency 
in  FOG  characteristics  and  the  derived  biodiesel  leading  to  un- 
certainty prior evaluation for biodiesel characteristics, the produc- 
tion cost, and the optimum operation conditions. Therefore, careful 
planning  and  sincere  feasibility  investigations  are  needed  before 
getting into a decision of implementing FOG-to-biodiesel production 
in a speciﬁc region. To aggregate the above-mentioned directions 
for  pragmatic  applications,  potential  of  FOG  as  a  biodiesel  feed- 
stock, relevant advancements, knowledge and insights about FOG 
utilization are ineluctably required. In such perspective, this paper 
could  act  as  a  basic  reservoir  which  attempted  to  deal  in  every 

possible  dimension,  and  could  be  vividly  distinguished  from  the 
previously published works ( Table 9 ). Even though the present re- 
view focused mainly on biodiesel, it conﬁrmed that further devel- 
opment and integration of different biofuel forms might enhance 
the technical and economical feasibilities of the process. Previous 
studies have demonstrated that high content of LCFAs has a nega- 
tive impact on anaerobic digestion under high lipid content. How- 
ever, the potential of sequential energy recovery from FOG through 
biodiesel  production  followed  by  anaerobic  digestion  could  en- 
hance the total energy yield. In addition, transesteriﬁcation with 
other promising biodiesel feedstock seems prospecting and attrac- 
tive, but requires more direct studies revealing the optimization of 
inﬂuencing parameters. Further research on determining this dual 
fuel potential would encourage the economy of FOG-management 
effectively and thus reduces the related environmental problems.
