    "question_text": "How does the inverse jet diffusion flame (IJDF) configuration fundamentally alter soot formation mechanisms compared to normal jet diffusion flames (NJDF), and what are the key fluid dynamic and chemical kinetic factors responsible for reduced soot volume fraction in IJDF?",
    "standard_answer": "The IJDF configuration fundamentally alters soot formation by reversing the reactant delivery mode, with central air surrounded by annular fuel, which decouples soot oxidation from evolution. In NJDF, soot forms on the fuel-rich side of the flame sheet, remains in high-temperature zones for extended residence times, and undergoes significant surface growth and oxidation, leading to higher soot volume fractions (∼10⁻⁷). In contrast, IJDF's flow dynamics cause incipient soot particles to be carried across the flame sheet by the high-velocity central air jet, reducing residence time in high-temperature regions and inhibiting surface growth. Key factors include: (1) Enhanced fuel entrainment and mixing due to the relative momentum between air and fuel jets, which limits soot precursor (e.g., PAH) accumulation. (2) The annular sooting zone in IJDF is sandwiched between inner OH and outer PAH layers, preventing soot from crossing into oxidizer-rich regions, thus minimizing oxidation and maturation. (3) Numerical simulations show surface growth rates are slower in IJDF, with peak soot volume fractions an order of magnitude lower (∼10⁻⁹) than NJDF. This is supported by experimental observations where soot particles in IJDF are smaller (3–5 nm) and less carbonized, indicating incipient characteristics due to reduced thermal and chemical exposure.",

      "1": "The soot formation, evolution and morphology in inverse jet diffusion flame differ fundamentally from that of the normal jet diffusion flame (NJDF) due to its distinct reactant delivery mode and fluid dynamics.",
      "2": "In IJDF, the soot formation strongly depends on the air and fuel jet velocities. This is due to the fact that the incipient soot particles in the fuel-rich annular region are carried across the flame sheet by the high-velocity central air jet, which gives less residence time for the soot particles to stay in the high-temperature flame zone and hence inhibits their surface growth."

    "standard_answer": "Buoyancy-induced vortical structures in laminar IJDF significantly influence soot particle entrainment and maturation by altering particle trajectories and exposure to soot-forming chemical environments. Unsteady simulations with detailed chemistry reveal that large toroidal vortices form outside the flame surface, with their growth being predominant downstream of the flame tip compared to normal jet diffusion flames (NJDF). These vortices entrain soot precursors like benzene from the fuel-rich annular region, transporting them into zones conducive to soot inception and growth. The entrainment of injected particles with gaseous benzene by these buoyancy-induced vortices outside the flame is evident from simulations, suggesting that this mechanism increases particle residence time in optimal soot-forming conditions. This prolonged exposure promotes surface coagulation and growth processes, leading to particle maturation. The interplay between vortex dynamics and flame configuration thus plays a critical role in soot evolution in IJDF, distinguishing it from NJDF where soot formation mechanisms differ due to distinct reactant delivery modes and fluid dynamics.",

    "question_text": "Explain the formation of the double-flame structure in laminar IJDF, focusing on how the air-fuel velocity ratio affects entrainment and mixing to create distinct blue and orange-yellow flame zones. Discuss the mechanisms behind this structure based on the provided citations.",
    "standard_answer": "The double-flame structure in laminar IJDF forms due to the interaction between the high-momentum central air jet and the low-momentum annular fuel jet. The schematic of the Type III flame shown in Fig. 5(a) has a parabolic blue flame at the bottom enveloped by an annular orange-yellow flame at the top. These flame portions were referred to as blue zone and orange-yellow cap, respectively. This structure arises because the central air jet velocity is approximately three times higher than the annular fuel jet velocity. Hence, this high momentum central air jet is expected to effectively entrain and mix a part of the low momentum fuel jet to form partially premixed reactants near the flame base. The burning of this premixed air-fuel might be the reason for the blue zone closer to the flame base. The part of the annular fuel jet that escapes entrainment travels upward due to buoyancy-induced flow, diffuses with ambient air, and ignites upon contact with hot products from the blue zone, forming the annular orange-yellow cap. The air-fuel velocity ratio governs the extent of entrainment and premixing, with higher ratios enhancing mixing and broadening the blue zone, while lower ratios allow more fuel to escape, enlarging the orange-yellow cap.",

    "question_text": "Based on the provided review paper, explain how the relative velocity between air and fuel jets affects flame height in turbulent inverse jet diffusion flames (IJDF), and describe the underlying mixing mechanisms responsible for this relationship.",
    "standard_answer": "In turbulent inverse jet diffusion flames (IJDF), the relative velocity between the central air jet and annular fuel jet significantly influences flame height through enhanced mixing mechanisms. According to the review paper, 'In the case of turbulent IJDF, the higher relative velocity (Ve) between air and fuel jets ensures better fuel entrainment and enhanced mixing, resulting in shorter visible flame height than the NJDF.' This occurs because increased relative velocity amplifies shear-induced turbulence at the air-fuel interface, which intensifies the entrainment of the annular fuel jet by the central air jet. The enhanced turbulent mixing accelerates the scalar dissipation rates, promoting faster fuel-air mixing and reducing the distance required for complete combustion. Consequently, the flame height decreases as the relative velocity increases. The paper further notes that 'The air-fuel velocity ratio does not consider the effect of fuel/oxidizer density ratio in describing the extent of fuel-oxidizer mixing in IJDF,' suggesting that while velocity ratio is a key parameter, momentum considerations incorporating density effects may provide a more comprehensive characterization of mixing efficiency in these flames.",

Specifically, explain the observed flame structure changes and diagnostic signatures that indicate premixed zones, citing relevant experimental findings from the paper.",
    "standard_answer": "Partial premixing in turbulent IJDF manifests through distinct flame structure modifications and diagnostic signatures observed in experimental studies. In CoA (Coaxial) burner configurations, the high-velocity central air jet entrains the annular fuel jet, creating regions where air and fuel mix before combustion. This partial premixing is evidenced by specific flame structure changes: the annular OH ring broadens and merges with the jet centerline, indicating reaction zone propagation into a well-mixed region. For instance, at a velocity ratio (Vr) of 20.7, OH-PLIF images show this merging, signifying enhanced premixing. Additionally, CH* chemiluminescence imaging reveals a double flame structure in turbulent LPG-air IJDF, where an enhanced air-fuel mixing region, referred to as the premixed zone, is identified. Color schlieren visualization in turbulent natural gas-air IJDF further supports this by showing even-colored regions in the shear region and jet central axis, attributed to well-mixed zones. However, the paper notes that attributing well-mixed regions from schlieren to partially premixed zones is ambiguous and requires further investigation. These diagnostic methods—OH-PLIF, CH* chemiluminescence, and color schlieren—provide qualitative evidence of partial premixing by highlighting regions where reaction zones propagate into mixed reactants, though quantitative characterization (e.g., local equivalence ratio measurements) is lacking in the cited studies.",
