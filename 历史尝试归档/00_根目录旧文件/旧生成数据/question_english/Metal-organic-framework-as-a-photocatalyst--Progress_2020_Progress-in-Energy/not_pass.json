    "question_text": "Using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling, analyze the heat transfer and fluid flow characteristics in a metal-organic framework (MOF) photocatalytic reactor system for CO₂ reduction. The reactor operates at 298 K with CO₂ flowing through a porous UiO-66-NH₂ catalyst bed with 65% porosity. Explain how the uniform channels and cages in MOF crystals affect mass transfer during photocatalysis, and discuss how charge transfer mechanisms influence photocatalytic efficiency based on the paper's analysis of MOF performance in CO₂ reduction applications.",
    "standard_answer": "CFD modeling of the MOF photocatalytic reactor reveals important transport phenomena governing CO₂ reduction efficiency. The genuine structural features of MOF crystals, particularly the uniform channels and cages, offer an effective means for mass transfer during photocatalysis, enabling rapid reactant diffusion to active sites while minimizing transport limitations. This optimized mass transfer is critical since photocatalytic CO₂ reduction involves sequential reactions including diffusion/adsorption of reactants from the bulk phase to the catalyst surface. The charge transfer mechanisms in MOF photocatalysts, particularly ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT), play a fundamental role in photocatalytic efficiency. Computational analyses show that organic linkers serve as photosensitizers by injecting photogenerated excitons to secondary building units, increasing redox potential and enabling sequential photocatalysis including photoexcitation, charge separation/migration, and photo-redox reactions. The photocatalytic performances of MOFs are evaluated between pristine and modified forms with particular emphasis on CO₂ reduction applications, where enhanced charge separation via LMCT mechanisms significantly improves conversion efficiency by reducing electron-hole recombination rates and extending charge carrier lifetimes.",
