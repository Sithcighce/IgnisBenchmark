Porous media play important roles in a wide range of scientific and engineering problems. Recently, with their 
increasing application in energy conversion and storage devices, such as fuel cells, batteries and supercapacitors, 
it has been realized that transport processes and reactions occurring in the pores and at the interfaces of different 
constituents significantly affect the performance of the porous media, yet these pore-scale transport phenomena 
are  not  well  described  or  even  neglected  in  the  conventional  numerical  models  based  on  the  representative 
element volume (REV). Pore-scale modeling is an efficient tool for the simulation of pore-scale transport and 
reactions in porous media because of its ability to accurately characterize these processes and to provide the 
distribution details of important variables which are challenging for current experimental techniques to provide 
either due to lack of in-situ measurement capability or due to the limited spatial and temporal resolution. In the 
present  review,  the  advances  and  challenges  of  the  state-of-the-art  pore-scale  modeling  are  summarized.  The 
practical applications of pore-scale modeling in the fields of geoscience, polymer exchange membrane fuel cells 
(PEMFC)  and  solid  oxide  fuel  cells  (SOFC)  are  discussed.  Notable  results  from  the  pore-scale  modeling  are 
presented, and the challenges facing the pore-scale model development are discussed. This in-depth review is 
intended to give a well-rounded introduction of critical aspects on which the pore-scale modeling can shed light 
in the development of relevant scientific and engineering systems.   

1. Introduction 

A porous medium is a type of material consisting of pores and solid 
skeletons. Porous media are ubiquitous in numerous branches of engi-
neering  and  science  (See  Fig.  1),  such  as  electrodes  in  fuel  cells  and 
batteries  [1,2],  reservoirs  of  hydrocarbon  resources  [3],  subsurface 
systems for CO2 sequestration [4], metal foams in heat exchangers [5], 
thermal insulation materials [6], packed-bed reactors [7], filtration [8] 
and biological systems [9], etc. Performance of porous media not only 
depends on the material chemistry, but also on the transport processes 
(fluid flow, heat and mass transfer, chemical reactions, etc.) occurring 
inside the porous media. Compared with simple geometries, the porous 
structures of porous media are very complex with abundant interface 
between  different  constituents,  leading  to  complicated  transport  pro-
cesses.  Understanding  the  phenomena  and  mechanisms  of  transport 
processes  inside  porous  media  is  critical  for  optimizing  the  material 

structures, controlling the related processes and improving the perfor-
mance [10–12]. 

Technique development facilitates observation and characterization 
of  the  microstructures  of  porous  media  and  transport  phenomena 
therein,  such  as  mercury  intrusion  porosimetry,  Brunauer-Emmett- 
Teller  (BET),  scanning  electron  microscopy  (SEM),  transmission  elec-
tron microscopy (TEM), focused ion beam (FIB)-SEM, X-ray computed 
tomography  (XCT)  and  nuclear  magnetic  resonance  imaging  (NMR) 
[13–15]. Experimental studies of transport processes in porous media 
are  usually  expensive. Besides,  the spatial and  temporal  resolution  of 
current techniques  still needs  further improvement for  accurate char-
acterization of the 3D geometric information. While great progress has 
been made in imaging porous structures, direct measurement of physi-
cochemical processes inside porous media is still challenging, either due 
to lack of in-situ measurement capacity or due to the limited spatial and 
temporal resolution [16–18]. 

Numerical  modeling  has  been  increasingly  adopted  to  predict

transport phenomena in porous media under a wide range of conditions, 
providing a deep understanding of the underlying transport mechanisms 
[19]. In general, numerical modeling of transport processes in porous 
media can be classified either as continuum-scale or as  pore-scale. In 
continuum-scale models, a porous medium is usually treated as a ho-
mogeneous  and  isotropic  region,  with  the  pore-scale  heterogeneity 
neglected.  Macroscopic  conservation  equations  are  solved,  which  are 

obtained  based  on  volumetric  averaging  theories  for  a  representative 
elementary volume (REV) in which phenomenological parameters are 
introduced to implicitly account for the microstructures of porous media 
[19]. These phenomenological parameters include porosity, pore size, 
specific surface area, tortuosity, permeability and relative permeability, 
effective  diffusivity/thermal  conductivity,  effective  reaction  rate,  etc. 
For  example,  for  single-phase  fluid  flow,  Darcy,  Brinkman-extended 

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience88(2022)1009682L. Chen et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    

Darcy or the Forchheimer-extended Darcy equation has been adopted 
[20,21],  in  which  the  permeability  is  employed  to  describe  the  flow 
capacity of porous media. 

Continuum-scale  models  have  been  widely  adopted  for  predicting 
large-scale transport processes which are of interest in the engineering 
field. However, since the average length of a computational element in 
the continuum-scale models is usually much larger than the typical pore 
size of a porous medium, the microscale heterogeneity of porous media 
is neglected in the continuum-scale models. Although effective transport 
properties and their large-scale spatial heterogeneity frequently emerge 
as remarkable factors governing the transport processes, it is recognized 
that the microscale heterogeneity also plays an important role, and the 
pore-scale processes greatly affect or even dominate the system perfor-
mance,  durability,  cost  and  safety,  as  schematically  shown  in  Fig.  1 
[22–25]. Besides, important parameters, which have been identified as 
key factors affecting the transport processes in porous media, are often 
lumped into a single phenomenological parameter, such as the relative 
permeability which is only a function of the saturation in the current 
extended Darcy-law for porous multiphase flow [26]. While such lump is 
pragmatic, whether it is tenable in theory is questionable. For example, 
the  extended  Darcy-law  has  long  been  criticized  for  neglecting  the 
viscous  coupling  between  different  phases  [27].  In  sum,  the 
continuum-scale models for porous media have made great progress at 
the scale of engineering interest, however it still needs to be improved in 
some  aspects  such  as  the  accuracy  of  the  empirical  relationships  and 
sub-grid models. 

Alternatively,  the  pore-scale  models  directly  solve  transport  pro-
cesses  in  the  realistic  porous  structures  [27–35].  In  the  pore-scale 
simulation, the microscopic porous structures of the porous media are 
explicitly resolved, and thus the phenomenological parameters are not 
required in advance. The pore-scale models provide distribution details 
of  important  variables  at  the  pore-scale,  enable  a  direct  link  of  the 
complex transport processes to the realistic porous structures, and thus 
can provide deep understanding of the relationships between structures, 
processes  and  performance.  Due  to  the  advancement  of  the  imaging 
techniques,  the  numerical  methods  and  the  computer  techniques,  the 

pore-scale  modeling  has  been  undergoing  considerable  development 
during  the  past  decades  and  has  been  widely  adopted  for  studying 
transport  phenomena  in  porous  media  [32,36-42].  The  capacity  and 
efficiency of the pore-scale modeling depend on four major components 
as shown in Fig. 2: (1) Accurately describing the porous structures and 
distribution details of different constituents [32,43-46]; (2) Establishing 
physicochemical models for the transport phenomena taking place in-
side the porous media [29,31,47], developing efficient and robust nu-
merical  methods  to  solve  the  governing  equations  and  performing 
pore-scale  modeling  [35,36,42];  (3)  Analyzing  pore-scale  spatial  and 
temporal evolutions of related variables to gain deep understanding of 
the underlying mechanisms, and investigating effects of porous struc-
tures  and  interfacial  characteristics  on  the  transport  processes;  and 
finally  (4)  Based  on  the  pore-scale  results,  or  the  continuum-scale 
modeling  results  with  upscaled  pore-scale  results,  modifying  porous 
structures,  physicochemical  properties  or  operating  conditions  to 
enhance, weaken, or control transport processes in porous media to gain 
better system performance. 

There have been a few reviews on pore-scale modeling. These ref-
erences are of great help for readers who are interested in studying the 
underlying transport phenomena in porous media. The review of Meakin 
and  Tartakovsky  [36]  focused  on  numerical  methods  for  pore-scale 
modeling  of  multiphase  flow  including  the  lattice  Boltzmann  method 
(LBM), the Monte Carlo method, the particle methods, the pore network 
method  and  the  traditional  computational  fluid  dynamics  (CFD) 
methods.  Blunt  et  al.  [32]  reviewed  the  pore-scale  imaging  and 
modeling with focus on the subsurface flow. For review of pore-scale 
modeling  of  transport  processes  in  electrochemical  devices,  readers 
can refer to the following Refs. [39–42]. Compared with existing reviews 
of the pore-scale modeling, this paper tries to provide a generic overview 
of  recent  progress  regarding  the  four  steps  of  pore-scale  modeling 
mentioned  above,  the  challenges  encountered,  method  and  scheme 
development, the pore-scale models applications, as well as the essential 
topics  that  the  pore-scale  simulations  tend  to  resolve.  It  is  worth 
mentioning  that  the  literature  on  the  pore-scale  modeling  is  over-
whelming, and this review does not intend to cover all the pore-scale

studies which is probably an impossible task. 

The remaining parts of this review are arranged as follows. First, in 
Section 2, structure reconstruction methods which are the first step to-
wards  pore-scale modeling  are introduced, including both  the experi-
mental  imaging  techniques  and  the  computational  reconstruction 
methods. Then, in Section 3, the numerical schemes of boundary and 
interface  treatment  are  reviewed,  because  successful  pore-scale 
modeling  highly  depends  on  accurate  description  of  boundaries  and 

interfaces.  From  Section  4  to  Section  7,  application  of  pore-scale 
modeling is introduced, and emphasis is placed on the physics of pore- 
scale transport phenomena and coupled mechanisms between different 
sub-processes. In Section 4, multiple transport processes occurring in the 
porous  media  including  fluid  flow,  heat  transfer,  mass  transport  and 
chemical reaction are introduced, and application to different types of 
porous media is incorporated. In this way, it is hoped that readers with 
different backgrounds can benefit from this review. In Sections 5 to 7,

three  practical applications  of  the  pore-scale  modeling  are  presented, 
namely  the  geoscience,  the  proton  exchange  membrane  fuel  cell 
(PEMFC) and the solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC). In Section 8, perspective of 
pore-scale modeling is discussed. Finally, in Section 9, conclusions of the 
present review are drawn. 

2. Porous structure imaging and computational reconstruction 

The structural details of a porous medium are resolved in pore-scale 
modeling  rather  than being  homogenized  like  that  in  the  continuum- 
scale modeling. In order to achieve pore-scale modeling with high ac-
curacy,  the  first  step  is  to  obtain  accurate  description  of  the  micro-
structures of a porous medium. Porous media exhibit a wide range of 
variability  in  their  porous  structures.  The  methodology  to  obtain  the 
geometrical details of the porous media with high fidelity can be clas-
sified  into  two  categories:  the  direct  experimental  imaging  and  the 
computational reconstruction. 

2.1. Experimental imaging 

In the direct imaging, 3D microstructures of a porous medium are 
obtained with experimental imaging techniques such as the XCT [48], 
the  FIB-SEM  [49],  and  the  Electron  Tomography  [50].  The  XCT  is  a 
non-invasive and non-destructive imaging technique which can provide 
structure details inside the porous media. The porous medium is imaged 
from different directions to generate sequential 2D cross-sections, which 
are subsequently combined together to form a 3D structure. The reso-
lutions  of  the  micro-CT  and  nano-CT  are  1–5  μm  and  10–20  nm, 
respectively. Besides imaging structures, the XCT also has been widely 
adopted to investigate multiphase flow in porous media [51]. Fig. 3(a) 
displays  the  porous  structures  of  sandstone  obtained  by  XCT  with  a 
resolution of 1 μm. 

For porous media with a characteristic length of a few nanometers, 
the FIB-SEM is commonly adopted. The FIB is adopted to mill the porous 
media, by which a newly exposed surface is generated, and then the SEM 
is employed to image the surface. The sequential 2D images are then 
combined  together  to  generate  a  3D  structure.  Such  method  has  an 
anisotropic  resolution:  the  resolution  of  the  FIB-SEM  in  the  in-plane 
direction depends  on the SEM technique and  can be as fine as 2 nm, 
while in the slicing direction which are controlled by the FIB is around 
10–20 nm. Compared with X-ray, the FIB-SEM is a destructive technique 
[52]. Fig. 3(b) shows the structures of a catalyst layer (CL) in PEMFC 
obtained by FIB-SEM with a resolution of 3.4 nm × 3.4 nm × 13.6 nm in 
x, y and z directions [18]. 

Porous  media  often  present  multiscale  structures  and  consist  of 
multiple  constituents.  Because  different  experimental  techniques  usu-
ally identify different constituents and cover different length scales, it is 
challenging for a single method to provide comprehensive geometrical 
information. For example, XCT and FIB-SEM lack the ability to distin-
guish the carbon, Pt particles and ionomer inside the CL mentioned in 
Fig. 3(b). TEM can provide high-resolution images in which the solid 
phase  can  be  further  differentiated  into  carbon,  ionomer  and  Pt. 
Combining  different  experimental  techniques  can  help  generate 
comprehensive morphology covering different length scales and identify 
distributions of different constituents in porous media. Fig. 3(c) shows 
the porous structures of CL provided by such a hybrid method, where 
Nano-CT is adopted to extract the secondary pores and carbon matrix 
while TEM is employed to obtain the Pt distributions [53]. 

The above imaging techniques are of great help to understand the 
realistic  porous  structures.  However,  their  application  is  seriously 
limited by relatively low resolution, strict requirement for the operating 
conditions, or large contrast between image resolution and sample size 
[44]. Further, only a single image of a porous medium is typically ac-
quired each time when imaging techniques are adopted. To evaluate the 
variability  associated  with  the  geometries  and  constituents  of  porous 
media,  numerous  experiments  have  to  be  conducted  to  analyze  the 

statistical feature of porous media which are time consuming and cost 
intensive [46]. 

2.2. Computational reconstruction 

The computational reconstruction method is to numerically generate 
realizations  of  the  porous  structures  based  on  limited  geometrical  in-
formation of the porous media, and these realizations should represent 
the  morphology  and  transport  properties  of  the  real  porous  media  as 
accurately as possible. In the literature, reconstruction of porous media 
is a valuable and appealing topic, and many efforts have been devoted to 
developing  different  reconstruction  methods.  Generally,  the  existing 
methods  can  be  divided  into  two  kinds:  the  statistical  reconstruction 
method and the process-based reconstruction method [44]. The statis-
tical reconstruction method generates the porous structures using sta-
tistical  constraints  which  are  usually  obtained  from  2D  images.  The 
process-based  reconstruction  method,  on  the  other  hand,  tries  to 
mimic the processes that generate the present porous structures. Going 
into details of each method is out of the scope of this paper. Only a few 
typical reconstruction methods are briefly introduced. 

For the statistical reconstruction method, the first step is to obtain 
the 2D images of the porous media. There are several well-established 
2D imaging methods with high-resolution, such as SEM and TEM, and 
these 2D techniques are easier to obtain compared with the 3D imaging 
techniques. Based on high-resolution 2D images of a porous medium, the 
topological  features  can  be  identified  and  statistical  parameters 
(porosity, pore size, particle size, two-point statistical function, etc.) can 
be evaluated. Honoring these structural parameters, certain exquisitely 
designed procedures are implemented to construct the complex micro-
scopic structures. 

The simulated annealing procedure [54] is one of the most exten-
sively used stochastic reconstruction methods. The reconstruction pro-
cess is conducted as an energy minimization problem, with the energy 
defined as the difference between the correlation functions of the target 
porous media and the reconstructed structures. An initial random trial 
porous structure is evolved obeying certain schemes until the energy is 
lower than a prescribed value. Compared with Gaussian random field 
method with correlation functions as porosity and two-point correlation 
function [55,56], the simulated annealing procedure takes into account 
the functions containing more morphological information such as the 
lineal-length [57] or the chord-length distributions [58]. 

The  Markov  Chain  Monte  Carlo  (MCMC)  method  belongs  to  the 
multiple-point  statistics  (MPS)  method  [59].  The  main  assumption  of 
such MPS method is that the state of certain point is determined by only 
a small number of neighborhood points. Thus, the state of the point can 
be predicted from the states of neighborhood points. 2-point, 5-point, 
and 6-point neighborhoods were introduced for the 2D porous media 
generation;  and  further  7-point,  8-point,  10-point,  11-point,  and 
15-point neighborhoods were introduced for 3D porous media genera-
tion. The probability of each neighborhood was obtained from 2D image 
analysis. 

The process-based reconstruction method is usually designed for the 
particle-based  structures.  For  example,  in  petroleum  engineering,  the 
sandstone  rocks  consisting  of  packed  grains  can  be  constructed  in 
following  steps,  namely  determining  the  particle  size  distribution, 
deposition  and  compaction  simulation  mimicking  the  sedimentary 
process, and subsequent cementing simulation representing the diage-
netic process. The particle deposition or packing process is important as 
it determines the topology of the pore space, which can be simulated by 
different  methods.  Cai  et  al.  [60]  adopted  Monte  Carlo  packing  of 
spherical  particles  to  get  the  microstructure  of  SOFC  electrode  to 
analyze  its  performance.  Qin  et  al.  [61]  used  the  discrete  element 
method (DEM) to simulate the assembly process of aluminum particles 
filling in a chip. Yan et al. [62] also used the DEM to generate SOFC 
electrodes  with  different  sizes  and  shapes  of  particles  to  evaluate the 
influence of powder morphology on microstructural properties.

The  quartet  structure  generation  set  (QSGS)  [63]  is  another 
process-based method. In such method, random seeds are added into the 
domain firstly, and then these seeds grow with different probability in 
different  directions.  By  changing  the  seed  number,  seed  shape  and 
values  of  probability  in  different  directions,  different  morphology  of 
porous media can be generated [63]. For example, antistrophic struc-
tures can be obtained by simply setting different values of probability in 
different directions. 

Besides  the  above  general  reconstruction  methods,  customized 
reconstruction methods for a specific kind of porous media also have 
been  developed  in  the  literature.  In  such  customized  methods,  the 
morphology  features  of  a  porous  medium  are  identified  and  subse-
quently combined with statistical correlation functions for reconstruc-
tion. Based on the authors’ experience, identification and employment 
of  the  topological  features  of  a  porous  medium  (structural  element 
characteristics, randomness, heterogeneity, et al.) lead to less constrains 
required for the subsequent reconstruction, which thus is greatly helpful 
to  simplify  the  reconstruction  procedures  and  to  improve  the  recon-
struction efficiency. Here, the reconstruction of fibrous porous media is 
briefly introduced, which is widely adopted as the electrodes of fuel cells 
and flow batteries, such as gas diffusion layer in PEMFC [64] and porous 
electrodes  in  vanadium  redox  flow  batteries  (VRFB)  [65,66]  (an 
example of the latter is shown in Fig. 4(a)). From the SEM image in Fig. 4 
(a), it can be observed that the fibrous electrode consists of randomly 
distributed fibers with shape approximately as long cylinders. Besides, 
statistical  information  of  the  electrode  also  can  be  obtained,  such  as 
porosity and carbon fiber diameter. The cylindrical fibers, identified as 
the  structural  element  in  the  reconstruction  process,  are  randomly 
placed  in  the  domain  until  the  reconstruction  constrain  is  satisfied, 
which is porosity in this case. Fig. 4(b) shows the reconstructed elec-
trode structures with different porosities and fiber diameters [67]. 

The  output  of  the  imaging  technique  or  the  computational  recon-
struction is a digital pixelated model representing the geometrical de-
tails  of  porous  media  with  each  constituent  in  the  porous  media 
resolved. The digital model is actually a 3D matrix, and the value of each 
node (or pixel) in the matrix represents a certain phase. For example, for 
the fibrous electrodes reconstructed in Fig. 4(b), 0 and 1 stand for pore 
and solid fiber, respectively. With such digital model at hand, statistical 
structural parameters of porous media can be easily calculated such as 
the pore size distribution (PSD) [68,69], the connectivity of each con-
stituent [70], the standard two-point correlation function [71], as well 
as the correlation function and the chord length function [72–74]. The 
obtained digital porous structures are used as input for pore-scale nu-
merical methods as discussed in the following section. 

3. Pore-scale numerical methods, boundary conditions and 
interfacial schemes 

3.1. Governing equations 

The  pore-scale  numerical  models  are  based  on  the  conservation 
principles such as conservation of mass, momentum, and thermal en-
ergy.  The  governing  equations  for  different  quantities  can  be  trans-
formed into the following general form of partial differential equations 
[75]: 

∂(ρ*ϕ)
∂t

(cid:0)
+ ∇(ρ*uϕ) = ∇

)
Γϕ∇ϕ

+ Sϕ

(1)  

where  u  is  the  fluid  velocity,  ϕ  is  the  general  variable  which  can 
represent  unknowns  such  as  the  velocity  and  temperature;  Γφ  is  the 
diffusion  coefficient;  Sφ  is  the  source  term.  Table  1  shows  the  repre-
sentatives of ρ*, ϕ, and Γφfor different conservation principles [76]. The 
conservation equations of the mass and momentum are also well known 
as the Navier-Stokes equation. 

In practice, porous media have been widely adopted as the electrodes 
in  electrochemical  devices  such  as  fuel  cells  and  batteries.  In  such 
electrodes, besides fluid flow, heat and mass transfer, charge transport 
simultaneously takes place, and the corresponding potential field related 
to such charge transport also can be described by Eq. (1). Taking proton 
and electron transport in PEMFCs  as an example, on the left side the 
unsteady term and convective term are set as zero, and on the right side 
Γφ  stands for the conductivity, ϕ  represents the potential and S is the 
source term related to electrochemical reaction [77]. 

Pore-scale  modeling  involves  solving  all  or  a  subset  of  the  above 
governing equations with appropriate boundary conditions. However, 
the complex nature of the porous media poses additional challenges. On 
the  one  hand,  the  tortuous  pathway  associated  with  the  complex 
structures  causes  difficulties  for  the  pore-scale  models  to  handle  the 
transport processes and the zigzag boundaries. On the other hand, the

porous media are usually made of various constituents in order to realize 
multiple  practical  functions.  Consequently,  abundant  interfaces  be-
tween different constituents are commonly found inside such multiple- 
constituent porous media. Across these interfaces, interfacial disconti-
nuities  of  related  properties  such  as  thermal  conductivity,  diffusivity, 
wettability, etc. are generated by the distinct characteristics of different 
constituents.  For  example,  in  the  CL  of  PEMFC,  electron  and  proton 
transport through Pt/C and ionomer, respectively; the reactant gas dif-
fuses in the void space, dissolves at the pore-ionomer interface, trans-
ports inside the ionomer, and finally arrives at the ionomer-Pt interface 
for electrochemical reactions. The transport properties of reactant gas in 
pores  and  ionomer  are  several  orders  of  magnitude  different  [78].  In 
fact,  such  across-interface  transport  processes  are  quite  common  in 
various applications of porous electrodes [42]. The interfacial transport 
processes pose great challenges to any numerical methods. Therefore, 
compared with transport processes in simple structures, the critical task 
for  pore-scale  models  is  to  develop  robust  schemes  for  treating  these 
boundaries and interfaces. This is also an important factor to consider 
when choosing an appropriate numerical method to solve the governing 
equations. 

Different numerical methods have been adopted for the pore-scale 
simulations  [35].  These  methods  generally  can  be  divided  into  three 
categories.  First,  traditional  CFD  methods  such  as  the  finite  type 
methods (the finite volume method (FVM), the finite element method 
(FEM)  and  the  finite  difference  method  (FDM))  directly  solve  the  NS 
equations through equation discretization with a given set of suitable 
boundary conditions [36,79]. Second, the pore-network model (PNM) 
also has been widely adopted for studying transport processes in porous 
media, in which the actual pore structures are abstracted into artificial 
pore  network  with  pores  denoting  the  locations  of  large  void  space 
connected  by  throats.  Although  the  realistic  porous  structures  are 
idealized in the PNM rather than directly resolved, the PNM has high 
computational  efficiency  and  is  effective  for  investigating  transport 
processes in porous media, such as incorporating invasion-percolation 
(IP)  process  for  capillary  flow  in  porous  media  [80,81].  Third,  the 
mesoscopic numerical methods, such as the lattice Boltzmann method 
(LBM), due to their kinetic nature, has the advantage of being flexible in 
specifying variables on the complex boundaries of porous media, and 
thus have gained popularity for simulating fluid flow in porous media 
and multiphase flow problems [37,82]. 

In this section, the numerical methods and schemes developed for 
the  single  or  multiphase  fluid  flow,  heat  transfer,  mass  transport, 
chemical reaction in porous media are briefly reviewed. Difficulties and 
challenges related to the pore-scale study of corresponding processes are 
introduced,  and  possible  solutions  are  presented  and  discussed. 
Emphasis  is  particularly  placed  on  the  treatment  of  the  complicated 
boundaries and interfaces, which are the main challenges for the pore- 
scale modeling. These challenges are not merely faced by a certain nu-
merical  method,  but  all.  As  mentioned  previously,  many  numerical 
methods such as FVM, FEM, FDM, PNM, Monte Carlo method and par-
ticle methods have been developed for pore-scale modeling. Discussing 
each numerical method is out of the scope of this review, and readers can 
refer  to  related  textbooks  for  detail.  In  this  section,  without  loss  of 
generality,  the  LBM  method,  particularly  its  recent  progress  directly 
related to pore-scale modeling, is emphatically introduced [83–88]. To 
the best of the authors’ knowledge, there has been none published work 
devoted to this aspect. Note that in Sections 4-7, when discussing about 
applications of the pore-scale models, the work using other numerical 
methods is also included and is not limited to the LBM. 

3.2. General description of the lattice Boltzmann method 

Compared  with  traditional  CFD  methods  based  on  a  direct  dis-
cretization of the Navier-Stokes equations, the LBM is a kinetic-theory 
based  numerical  methods  directly  derived  from  the  Boltzmann  equa-
tion [89]. Due to its kinetic origin, the LBM has many appealing features 

including  programming  simplicity,  intrinsic  parallelism,  as  well  as 
straightforward  treatment  for  complex  solid  boundaries,  multiphase 
flow and multiple species transport [83–88]. In the LBM, the motion of 
fluid  is  described  by  a  set  of  particle  distribution  functions,  and  the 
evolution equation is as follows [85] 

fi(x + eiΔt, t + Δt) (cid:0)

fi(x, t) = M(cid:0) 1 ̂SM[f eq

i (x, t) (cid:0)

f (x, t)] + Fi

i = 0 ∼ N

(2)  

where fi(x,t) is the ith density distribution function at the lattice site x 
eq  is the equilibrium 
and time t. ei  is the discrete lattice velocity, and fi
density  along  the  ith  direction.  The  widely  adopted  lattice  models 
include D2Q5 and D2Q9 for 2D, as well as D3Q7, D3Q15 and D3Q19 for 
3D  [90].  One  time  step  of  the  LBM  is  conceptually  divided  into  two 
sub-steps: collision and streaming. The collision relaxes the distribution 
functions towards a local equilibrium, while the streaming propagates 
(x, t) along the lattice vectors 

⌢
the postcollisional distribution function  f
to new locations.

The single-relaxation-time (SRT), or Bhatnagar–Gross–Krook (BGK) 
collision  model  has  been  widely  adopted.  However,  when  applied  to 
model fluid flow in porous media, the intrinsic permeability predicted is 
viscosity  (or  collision  time)  dependent,  which  is  unphysical  [85]. 
Therefore,  the  multiple-relaxation-time  (MRT)  approach  is  recom-
mended for simulating fluid flow in porous media. In Eq. (2), M is the 
̂S  is  the  relaxation  matrix.  M  can  be  con-
̂S in moment space can be reduced to 
structed based on the principle that 
a diagonal matrix [91]. For D3Q19 adopted, the diagonal terms are as 
follows

The above LB model can reproduce the Navier-Stokes equations in 
the quasi-incompressible limit. For single phase flow, it has been proven 
that the MRT scheme can obtain permeability independent of viscosity 
[85]. The MRT scheme also shows superiority when simulating the heat 
and mass transfer [88] and multiphase flow [92] as it can extend the 
range of the density ratio and viscosity ratio between different fluids. 

3.3. Boundary conditions and interfacial schemes 

The boundary conditions in the LBM are also expressed in terms of 
the  distribution  function.  In  the  LBM  simulation,  the  collision  is 
completely  local,  while  the  streaming  step  requires  information  from 
neighboring  nodes.  However,  for  a  boundary  or  interface  node,  the 
neighboring nodes either do not exist or belong to other constituents, 
making it difficult to directly propagate the information. So far, there 
have been many LBM boundary conditions developed in the literature 
[93–98]. In the present review, we focus on the LB boundary conditions 
and interfacial schemes closely related to modeling transport processes 
in porous media, as schematically shown in Fig. 5(a). In Fig. 5(a), white 
and blue regions represent pores filled by different types of fluids, such 
as gas and liquid. Gray region is the solid part. The orange region is a 
phase that mass can transports from fluid into this phase. Emphasis will 
be placed on the boundary conditions and interfacial schemes recently 
developed for these complicated transport processes as listed in Fig. 5 
(a).

3.3.1. No-slip flow boundary condition 

For  fluid  flow  in  porous  media,  the  no-slip  boundary  condition  is 
imposed at the fluid-solid interface, indicating that the velocity of the 
fluid node adjacent to a solid node is equal to that of the solid. In the LB 
framework,  simple  bounce-back  scheme  is  the  widely  employed 
boundary condition for the solid walls (Fig. 5(b))

described by Eq. (6a-6b) is a combination of the Dirichlet and Neumann 
boundaries. However, the exact values of the temperature and heat flux 
are not explicitly  prescribed in such conjugate heat transfer problem. 
Conventional finite type methods require iterative scheme and extrap-
olation operation to simulate the conjugate heat transfer problem [104, 
105]. In the past few years, various LBM schemes have been developed 
as an alternative approach to handle the conjugate heat transfer. 

where i is the reverse direction of i. The direction of i points from the 
solid node to the fluid node. It has been demonstrated that the actual 
location of the fluid-solid interface is located at the halfway between the 
fluid and solid nodes, and thus this scheme is called half-way bounce 
back scheme with second-order accuracy [99]. However such scheme 
reduces to a first-order accuracy for complicated boundaries. Therefore, 
other schemes, such as the Bouzidi-Firdaouss-Lallemand (BFL) scheme 
[100], and Guo, Zheng, and Shi (GZS) scheme [94], have been devel-
oped to guarantee second-order accuracy [101]. For a curved geometry, 
such as a sphere in a fluid domain, simply placing the boundary at the 
half-way will alter the geometry, leading to inaccurate prediction of the 
flow  field  and  the  estimation  of  the  force  acting  on  the  geometry. 
Therefore,  curved  boundary  conditions  are  proposed  in  conjunction 
with the use of Cartesian grid in order to retain the advantages of the LB 
method,  in  which  interpolation  is  adopted  to  calculate  the  unknown 
distribution  functions  [102,103].  However,  such  curved  boundary 
conditions require more information from neighboring nodes, while a 
sufficient number of neighboring nodes may not always be satisfied. 

3.3.2.

Interfacial heat transfer 

Heat  transfer  across  different  constituents  with  different  thermal 
properties  is  referred  as  conjugate  heat  transfer,  which  satisfies  the 
following continuity condition for temperature and heat flux (see Fig. 5 
(b))

Chen and Han [106] demonstrated that (ρCp)f and (ρCp)s can be assumed 
to be equal without affecting the final temperature distribution, leading 
to uniform ρCp in the entire domain. Consequently, the energy governing 
equation can be reduced to the following two formulas for fluid and solid 
phase, respectively

The above scheme for steady state conjugate heat transfer is called 
the “pseudo heat capacity of solid phase” scheme [106], based on which 
Wang et al. [107] adopted LBM to perform the pore-scale heat transfer 
processes.  With  such  scheme,  the  interface  is  placed  at  “half-lattice 
location”,  which  is  defined  as  the  center  of  two  adjacent  nodes.  As 
shown in Fig. 5(b), the standard streaming operator in the LBM can be 
applied without any specific treatment. The continuity of temperature 
and  heat  flux  at  the  fluid-solid  interface  is  automatically  satisfied. 
Although the “pseudo heat capacity of solid phase” scheme is limited to 
steady-state  heat  transfer  problem,  it  has  achieved  great  success  to 
predict effective thermal conductivity of porous media and composite 
materials  [63],  because  only  steady-state  temperature  distribution  is 
required to calculate the effective thermal conductivity [108]. 

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience88(2022)1009688L. Chen et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    

The thermal conductivity of an isotropic material is often expressed 
as a scalar value. However, an anisotropic material can possess different 
values  of  thermal  conductivity  along  different  directions.  Typical 
example is the graphene which is an allotrope of carbon in the form of 
two-dimensional hexagonal lattice [109]. In the thermal LB model, the 
relaxation time is related to the thermal conductivity. The BGK collision 
operator involves only a single relaxation time and thus is not sufficient 
to describe the anisotropic heat transfer. Yoshida and Nagaoka [110] 
developed a MRT thermal LB model, in which the off-diagonal compo-
nents of the relaxation time matrix are employed to take into account the 
anisotropy  of  the  thermal  conductivity.  In  their  work  [110],  heat 
transfer  process  with  a  single  anisotropic  material  was  studied.  Fang 
et al. [111] further combined the MRT thermal LB model [110] and the 
“pseudo-capacity of solid phase”  scheme [106] to predict the thermal 
conductivity  of  porous  media  with  several  materials  that  have  aniso-
tropic thermal conductivities. 

3.3.2.2. Unsteady state thermal LB model. Using the Chapmann-Enskog 
multi-scale  expansion,  the  following  governing  equation  for  tempera-
ture is obtained for the standard thermal LB model widely adopted

Compared Eq. (9) with the standard energy conservation equation 
described by Eq. (1), it can be found that they are the same only when 
the heat capacity ρCp  is constant in the entire domain [112]. With Eq. 
(9), the boundary condition satisfied at the interface is as follows

As discussed above, since (ρCp)f  =(ρCp)s  can be assumed when pre-
dicting the thermal conductivity, therefore, Eqs. (10a–10b) is considered 
to be equivalent to Eqs. (6a–6b). However, generally (ρCp)s=(ρCp)f is not 
satisfied  in  most  porous  media.  Consequently,  directly  adopting  the 
current thermal LB model will lead to errors for unsteady heat transfer 
process. 

In the literature, various schemes have been proposed to eliminate 
the above drawback of the standard LB thermal model for the conjugate 
heat  transfer.  These  schemes  generally  can  be  divided  into  two  cate-
gories:  the  boundary  condition  scheme  [105]  and  the  source  term 
scheme [112]. In the boundary condition scheme, the phase interface is 
considered as the boundaries for the heat transfer process in different 
constituents,  with  the  boundary  conditions  described  by  Eq.  (6).  To 
implement  Eq.  (6)  in  the  LB  framework,  Li  et  al.  [105]  developed  a 
general thermal LB boundary for conjugate heat transfer across curved 
interface. For straight interface and with interface located halfway be-
tween two nodes, the general thermal LB boundary can be reduced to the 
following form (See Fig. 5(b)):

where σ is (ρcp)s/(ρcp)f. It can be found that if σ=1, Eq. (11) reduces to 
the standard streaming operator. 

In the source term scheme [112], the energy governing equation is 
rearranged to match the form of Eq. (9) recovered from the thermal LB 
model through the Champan-Enskog multiscale expansion. The source 
term will be zero everywhere except at the interface. Such source term 
scheme does not require the specific treatment at the interface as in the 
boundary  condition  scheme.  The  source  term  scheme  can  be  imple-
mented either in the finite difference scheme or in the LB framework. 
Recently, the source scheme based on the enthalpy conversation equa-
tion  also  has  been  developed  in  the  literature  [113–116].  It  is  worth 
mentioning that the above schemes show different orders of accuracy 
under different conditions. Recently, Korba et al. conducted a compre-
hensive comparison of the above schemes for dealing with the conjugate 
heat transfer process in different heat transfer problems [117]. The test 
results indicate that when  the material  interface is not located  at the 
midpoint, the boundary condition scheme is of second order accuracy, 
while the source term scheme is at best of first-order accuracy because 
such scheme does not consider the exact location of the interface.

Interfacial mass transport 

The standard LB mass transport model can successfully handle binary 
diffusion process obeying the Fick’s law. For diffusion with more than 
two species obeying the Stefan-Maxwell equation, cross effects would 
play  important roles,  such as  reverse  diffusion,  osmotic diffusion  and 
diffusion barrier [118], which cannot be described by the Fick’s law. 
High-order multicomponent LB models have been developed by Joshi 
et al. [119] and subsequent studies [120–122]. Multiple collision terms 
with different relaxation times are adopted in such models to represent 
self-collisions and cross-collisions, with the viscosities of each compo-
nent and the diffusivities to be tuned independently [119]. While the 
SRT-LB model has been widely used, Chai et al. [88] pointed out that the 
concentration  field  predicted  by  SRT-LB  model  is  dependent  on  the 
relaxation time, and it was suggested that the MRT-LB model should be 
employed for studying the mass transport and predicting the effective 
diffusivity. 

Mass transport across interface between different constituents poses 
great challenges for the pore-scale modeling. Unlike heat transfer where 
the temperature is continuous across the interface, for mass transport, 
according to the Henry’s law, the concentration is not continuous at the 
interface of different constituents, and this discontinuity is termed as the 
concentration  jump.  The  interfacial  conjugate  conditions  for  concen-
tration are given as

where  Cjump  and  qjump  are  the  concentration  and  flux  jump  at  the 
interface,  respectively.  It is  worth mentioning  that in  this  section the 
subscript “f” and “s” stand for different phases, and do not necessarily 
mean fluid and solid phase. Guo et al. [123] developed a LB scheme, and 
for straight interface or interface located at the halfway between two 
nodes, the interfacial scheme is as follows (Details for the general curved 
interface can be found in Ref. [123])

where εD is a parameter related to the lattice model and σ is the ratio of 
diffusivity. 

In  addition,  the  local  chemical  reaction  occurring  at  the  interface 
makes the computational scheme more complicated. For example, in the 
CL of a PEMFC, the oxygen gas first diffuses inside the pores, dissolves 
into the ionomer, and finally reaches the Pt surface for electrochemical 
reaction [78]. At the pore-ionomer interface, the oxygen not only un-
dergoes  a  concentration  drop  according  to  the  Henry’s  Law,  but  also 
participates  in  a  local  dissolution  reaction  with  limited  reaction  rate 
[124]. Such local dissolution reaction greatly affects the local transport 
resistance and cell performance especially under low catalyst loading. 
For such scenarios, Mu et al. [125] further developed the following LB 
interfacial scheme 
(

reciprocal  of  the  local  reaction  rate  with  unit  of  s
interface and interface located halfway between two nodes, the inter-
facial  scheme  in  the  LB  framework  is  shown  in  Fig.  5(c),  and  the

where  F  is  the  Faraday  constant,  iref
0 is  the  exchange  current  density, 
CO2,refis the reference concentration, αc is the transfer coefficient, R is the 
gas constant. Note that the boundary described by Eqs. (17) and (18) is a 
mixed  boundary  condition.  It  is  worth  mentioning  that  in  the 
continuum-scale  models,  the  BV  equation  is  also  widely  adopted,  in 
which  the  concentration  on  the  right-hand  side  is  the  averaged  con-
centration in a computational cell with the homogeneous assumption as 
mentioned  previously.  However,  the  averaged  concentration  differs 
from the concentration at the reactive surface. There have been a few 
pore-scale studies taking into account such difference and predicting the 
mas transfer coefficient [131,132]. 

The following expression of the concentration distribution function 
in terms of the corresponding concentration and its gradient is derived 
by Kang et al. [129]: 
∑

giei = Cu (cid:0) D∇C

(19) 

In Fig. 5(d), after each streaming step, g4 is known and g2 is the value 
to be computed. In Ref. [129], the reactive wall is static. Since g2 enters 
the domain and g4  leaves the domain, based on Eq. (19) the following 
expression is obtained at the reactive node R: 

g2 (cid:0) g4 = (cid:0) D

∂C
∂y

(20) 

By  assuming  that  the  non-equilibrium  portion  of  the  distribution 
functions in opposite directions takes the opposite sign, the following 
equation is obtained [129]: 
2 + gneq
g2 + g4 = (geq

2 ) + (geq

4 ) = geq

4 + gneq

2 + geq

(21)

By combining Eqs. (20) and (21), g2 can be determined. 
Alternatively,  Zhang  et  al.  [95]  proposed  the  following  general 
bounce-back scheme for the concentration boundary conditions. First, 
Eq. (16) is solved directly using finite difference scheme, for example, 
the first-order difference scheme

3.3.4. Chemical reaction 

Transport  processes  with  chemical  reaction  in  porous  media  are 
pervasive in the scientific and engineering fields, such as the reactive 
transport in electrochemical devices [13], packed-bed reactors [7], CO2 
subsurface  sequestration  [38],  adsorption  and  desorption  [126,127], 
etc. In the LB framework, several concentration boundary conditions for 
chemical  reactions  have  been  proposed  [95,128-130].  Fig.  5(d)  sche-
matically shows the fluid-solid interface with chemical reaction, and the 
corresponding boundary condition is as follows [95] 

b1

∂C
∂n

+ b2C = b3

(16) 

Eq.  (16)  is  able  to  describe  all  the  three  types  of  concentration 
boundary conditions: the Dirichlet boundary condition, with b1=0 and 
b2 ∕= 0, the Neumann boundary condition, with b2=0 and b1 ∕= 0, and a 
mixed boundary condition, with b1  ∕= 0 and b2  ∕= 0. Typical reactions 
encountered can be well formulated in Eq. (16). One example is the first- 
order linear reaction 

D

∂C
∂n

(17) 

Another  example  is  the  oxygen  reduction  reaction  at  the  triple-

where CR and CF are the concentrations at interface node R and adjacent 
fluid node F, respectively, and ∆x is the vector connecting nodes F and 
R.  CR  is  the  only  unknown  variable  and  thus  can  be  directly  solved. 
Finally, Eq. (21) is utilized to solve the unknown g2. Note that higher- 
order  difference  schemes  also  can  be  adopted  to  discretize  the  first 
term  in  Eq.  (16)  to  achieve  better  accuracy,  but  of  course  they  will 
involve more nodes. 

Later, Chen et al. [33] further proposed the scheme by combining 
Eqs. (16) and (19) for boundary reaction. First, Eq. (16) is adopted to 
calculate the unknown concentration at the boundary CR. Then Eq. (19) 
is  employed  to  determine  the  unknown  distribution  function.  This 
general scheme can treat complex and moving boundaries. 

For some cases, the second term on the left side of Eq. (16) is not a 
linear term. For example, in vanadium redox flow battery, the electro-
chemical  reaction  taking  place  at  the  interface  between  electrolyte- 
carbon fiber interface is described by [67]

and V3+

where II and III represent V2+
, respectively. It can be found that 
exponent term exists for the concentration of V2+
. Iteration method such 
as the Newton–Raphson method can be adopted to solve CII in Eq. (23). 
After  CII  is  determined,  the  unknown  distribution  function  can  be 
calculated using the reaction boundary conditions described above. 

Note  that  heat  is  released  (absorbed)  during  exothermic  (endo-
thermic) reactions. Therefore, in those cases source/sink terms or heat 
flux boundary conditions need to be added into the pore-scale modeling 
of  heat  transfer  processes,  and  for  details  one  can  refer  to  Refs 

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience88(2022)10096810L. Chen et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    

[133–135]. 

3.3.5. Fluid-fluid and fluid-solid interface 

For  multiphase  fluid  system,  additional  equations  are  needed  to 
describe the two-phase interface movement and the interfacial tension 
at the interface. The volume-of-fluid method, level set method and phase 
filed method are three popular interface-capturing methods. In all the 
three methods, an indicator function is introduced to characterize the 
different phases, track the fluid-fluid interface movement and calculate 
the  interfacial  tension.  Then  the  two-phase  flow  dynamics  can  be 
modeled by coupling the interface-capturing methods with NS equation 
through  the  local  fluid  properties  and  interfacial  tension  forces  [36, 
136]. 

For  two-phase  flow  with  a  solid  surface,  the  two  phases  have 
different preferences on the solid surface, which is known as wettability 
and  is  characterized  by  contact  angle.  For  multiphase  flow  in  porous 
media, there are a large number of fluid-fluid interfaces and three-phase 
contact lines (contact points in 2D) as schematically shown in Fig. 5(a). 
Modeling the moving contact line (MCL) is a challenging task for the 
traditional  CFD  method.  The  incompressible  NS  equation  with  sharp 
interface model and no-slip boundary condition will lead to the multi- 
valued velocity field at the MCL, resulting in an infinite viscous stress 
and non-integrable dissipation in the vicinity of the MCL, known as non- 
integrable  stress  singularity  [137–140].  Even  though  some  strategies 
such as different slip boundary conditions [141] have been proposed to 
solve this problem, implementation of these methods on complex solid 
boundaries  in porous  media is still challenging. As  a diffuse-interface 
method,  the  phase  field  method  is  more  appropriate  for  solving  the 
MCL problem as the chemical diffusion in the thin interface can cause 
the motion of the contact line, even with the no-slip boundary condition 
[138–140]. 

Due to the kinetic nature, LBM models multiphase flow in a quite 
different  way.  Instead  of  introducing  another  model  to  describe  the 
interface  dynamics,  LBM  incorporates  the  intermolecular-level  in-
teractions  between  the  distribution  functions  to  achieve  the  phase 
segregation and multiphase flow dynamics. Several models have been 
proposed to simulate multiphase flow, such as the Rothman-Keller (RK) 
LB model adopting color gradients to separate and model the interaction 
at  the  multiphase  interfaces  [142,143],  the  pseudopotential  model  in 
which a pseudopotential is introduced to account for the nonlocal par-
ticle interactions [144–147], the free energy model in which phase ef-
fects are directly introduced into the collision process by considering a 
generalized equilibrium distribution function that includes a non-ideal 
pressure  tensor  term  [148],  etc.  For  the  detailed  description  of 
different multiphase LB models, one can refer to the related books [149]. 
Here,  the  two-component  pseudopotential  LB  model,  which  has  been 
widely  adopted to  simulate multiphase  flow  in porous  media [82],  is 
taken  as  an  example  to  illustrate  how  interfacial  tension  and  contact 
angle  are  modeled  in  the  LBM.  The  evolution  equations  of  different 
components are the same as Eq. (2). For the component k, with force 
considered, the macroscopic velocity u in Eq. (2) is calculated by

components. Fk  is the force acting on component k which includes the 
following  two  parts.  To  incorporate  the  interfacial  tension,  the  fluid- 
fluid interaction force is introduced as follows

Gf  controls the strength between fluids. The mixing between different 

components can be adjusted by changing Gf  and phase separation can 
only occur after a critical value of Gf [150].

action between the fluid and solid walls

where s(x + eiΔt) is an indicator function which is 0 for pore and 1 for 
solid. The coefficient Gk
s  controls the strength between fluid and solid 
walls  and  different  wettability  (contact  angles)  can  be  obtained  by 
adjusting Gk
s . For  example, Huang  et  al.  [151] proposed  an empirical 
k  according to 
expression to estimate the contact angle using Gk
Young’s equation when ψk is taken as ρk. This kind of wetting boundary 
condition is easy to implement and can generate a constant equilibrium 
contact angle at static state. In recent years, some geometric schemes to 
implement the wetting boundary condition are proposed for different 
multiphase LB models [152–154]. With this kind of wetting boundary 
condition, the contact angle can be prescribed before simulation and the 
spurious velocity near the three phase contact lines can be significantly 
reduced.  In  addition,  the  contact  angle  hysteresis  [152]  can  be  also 
incorporated  into  this  wetting  boundary  condition.  More  details  of 
contact angle modeling can be found in the related references [37,82, 
149,151,152,155]. 

It should be mentioned that all the multiphase LB models belong to 
the diffuse interface models, in which the fluid-fluid interface consists of 
a few lattices instead of a sharp interface. The diffusion of different fluid 
components in the vicinity of contact line can cause the motion of the 
contact line with the no-slip boundary condition. Therefore, there is no 
singularity problem in the LB simulation of moving contact-line prob-
lems while the no-slip boundary condition is satisfied [37,137]. 

4. Transport processes and macroscopic transport properties 

Pore-scale  modeling  can  provide  pore-scale  distribution  of  related 
variables (velocity, pressure, temperature, concentration, etc.) which is 
difficult to measure with experimental methods [156]. Such pore-scale 
knowledge is useful for better design and control of the transport pro-
cesses in porous media [157]. Based on these pore-scale distributions, 
macroscopic transport properties of porous media (permeability, effec-
tive  diffusivity,  effective  thermal  conductivity,  etc.),  which  are  of 
fundamental interest for the design of porous media, can be calculated. 
These transport properties also can be upscaled into the continuum-scale 
models to improve the accuracy of the continuum-scale models. 

When  applying  the  pore-scale  modeling  to  predict  macroscopic 
transport properties, the sample size  of the modeling should be suffi-
ciently large that the REV is achieved [28,158,159]. Note that while the 
REV  concept  has  been  widely  employed  and  well  recognized,  porous 
media with a system size on the order of the REV size or even smaller 
have been encountered in a variety of applications. For example, thin 
porous  media  are  widely  employed  in  electrochemical  devices  [160], 
the distinct feature of which is that their lateral dimensions are much 
higher than their thickness that is close to the typical pore size. For such 
porous media, the existence of REV is questionable and needs further 
investigation [161]. This point will be discussed in detail in Section 6. 

4.1. Single-phase fluid flow and permeability 

Permeability  is  the  most  important  transport  property  of  porous 
media, and it is also required as an input parameter in the continuum- 
scale  models  for  porous  fluid  flow  using  the  Darcy  law  with  k  as 
permeability and μ as dynamic viscosity [20]

In the literature there has been lots of experimental, theoretical and 

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience88(2022)10096811L. Chen et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    

numerical  work  to  find  functional  relationship  between  permeability 
and macroscopic properties of porous media (porosity, specific surface 
area,  tortuosity,  particle  size,  etc.)  [162–164].  Analytical  expressions 
relating  permeability  with  geometry  of  porous  media  only  exist  for 
relative  simple  porous  structures,  such  as  the  widely  adopted 
Kozeny-Carman  equation  for  creeping  flow  with  very  low  Reynolds 
number in packed-sphere porous media [162, 163]. Note that perme-
ability only depends on the structures of the porous media, and is not 
affected by the properties of fluids, and thus it is also called intrinsic 
permeability.  However,  when  the  pore  size  is  relatively  low  or  the 
Knudsen  number  (Kn,  the  ratio  between  the  mean  free  path  of  gas 
molecule and the characteristic pore size of a porous medium) is rela-
tively  high,  slippage  phenomenon  occurs,  leading  the  measured 
permeability  higher  than  the  intrinsic  permeability,  which  is  called 
apparent permeability [165,166]. The apparent permeability is affected 
not only by the porous structures, but also by the operating conditions 
and the fluid properties [87]. 

The  permeability  is  a  highly  medium-specific  transport  property. 
Currently, there is no general permeability model as a function of the 
statistic structural parameters for all the porous media. In the literature, 
the pore-scale modeling has been widely applied to study single-phase 
fluid  flow  and  to  predict  permeability  of  various  kinds  of  porous 
media, from ordered sphere packing, to more complex porous structures 
such as mono- and bi-disperse arrays of spheres [167], fibrous porous 
structures  [67,86,168,169],  and  subsurface  porous  systems  [71,87, 
170-173], etc. 

In this section, the fibrous porous media are taken as an example, 
which have been widely adopted in a broad range of applications, such 
as porous electrodes of fuel cell and battery, filter, paper production, 
thermal insulation, etc. Porosity of such porous media can be as high as 
0.9.  In  1997,  Koponen  et  al.  [169]  conducted  pore-scale  fluid  flow 
simulation inside fiber-web (as shown in Fig. 6(a)), and proposed the 

following  formula  for  the  permeability  with  porosity  in  the  range  of 
0.4~0.95

Nabovati  et  al.  [168]  studied  pore-scale  fluid  flow  inside  random 
packing of fibers (see Fig. 6(b)) and adopted the formula of Gebart [174] 
to fit their results with porosity in the range of 0.08 to 0.99

where εc  is the threshold porosity below which there is no permeating 
flow. A and B are fitting parameters. In Ref. [168], A = 1.974, B = 2.31 
and εc  = 0.0743. Chen et al. [67] also studied pore-scale fluid flow in 
fiber-based porous electrodes of flow batteries, and the fitted values are 
with 1.416, 2.202 and 0.163 for A, B and εc respectively. 

Hao and Cheng [86] predicted in-plane and through-plane perme-
ability of layered fibrous porous media adopted in PEMFC (Fig. 6(c)). 
The  relationship  proposed  by  Tomadakis  and  Roberston  [175]  was 
adopted to fit the predicted permeability:

equations. It can be found that the permeability predicted is significantly 
affected by the microscopic structures of the carbon-fiber porous media. 
Thus, there are also many studies in the literature investigating effects of 
fiber  orientation,  aspect  ratio,  arrangement  pattern,  binder  and

compression  on  the  permeability  [176–181],  and  many  relationships 
between the permeability and the structural properties have been pro-
posed as reported in Refs. [174,177,182]. 

Note that the Darcy law is only valid for incompressible, slow and 
viscous flow in porous media (Reynolds number ≪ 1). When the flow 
rate  is  relatively  high,  inertial  force  becomes  large,  leading  to  the 
breakdown of the linear relationship as indicated by the Darcy’s equa-
tion [21,183]. Under higher velocities, the Darcy equation is corrected 
with a quadratic term to account for the inertial effect, leading to the 
Darcy–Forchheimer equation [21]

Comparing Eqs. (31) and (32), β can be easily obtained as 1.75(1 (cid:0)

suggesting that the second term in Eq. (31) should be cubic rather than 
quadratic [184]. It is worth mentioning that the quadratic or cubic term 
does not refer to the turbulence regime. 

Pore-scale studies also have been performed to study the beta factor 
and  the  onset  of  the  non-Darcy  flow.  Chai  et  al.  [185]  performed 
pore-scale study of fluid flow through 2D random circles. Darcy, cubic 
and quadratic regime were identified under different Re. Chukwudozie 
and Tyagi [186] performed pore-scale modeling for fluid flow in body 
centered  cubic  (BCC)  sphere  pack  beyond  the  regime  of  Darcy’s  law. 
Simulation  results  indicate  the  transition  from  Darcy  to  Forchheimer 
occurs at Re=4, with β as 7.5 × 104 m

4.2. Heat transfer 

Porous media are widely adopted for heat transfer purpose, such as 
heat  transfer  enhancement,  heat  guides,  thermal  isolation,  etc.  For 
example, due to high specific surface area, high conductivity of the solid 
matrix (usually aluminum, nickel and copper) and enhanced flow mix-
ing, porous metal foam has a great potential to enhance heat transfer 
[5]. On the other hand, due to special structures with nanoscale solid 
networks  and  interconnected  nano-/micrometric  pores,  aerogel  with 
thermal  conductivity  even  lower  than  the  air  has  been  adopted  for 
thermal insulation in space shuttles, nuclear reactors and ordinary steam 
pipes  [187,188].  Recently,  with  the  development  of  the  theories  of 
transformation thermotic, novel thermal metamaterials also have been 
developed (such as thermal cloaks, thermal camouflage, thermal rota-
tors,  thermal  transparency,  etc.)  [189,190],  with  heat  flux  accurately 
controlled. 

Effective thermal conductivity (λeff) is one of the fundamental ther-
mal properties of a porous medium [191,192]. Accurate evaluation of 
the  effective  thermal  conductivity  is  important  for  manipulating  the 
heat flux and designing the porous media. Theoretically, λeff is a function 
of the volume fraction εi and thermal conductivity λi of each constituent 
and can be determined by λeff = f(λi,εi). The expression of f depends on 
the  distribution  details  of  different  constituents.  For  simple  porous 
structures, five basic models have been proposed [193,194]. However, 
for complex porous structures, the above basic models usually are not 
applicable  due  to  the  geometric  complexity  [195].  As  mentioned  in 
Section 3.2, for the purpose of predicting effective thermal conductivity, 
only steady-state distributions of the temperature are required, and thus 
the “pseudo heat capacity of solid phase” scheme can be adopted [106]. 
During the implementation of pore-scale prediction of effective thermal 
conductivity, temperature gradient is applied along the direction under 
consideration,  and  details  of  temperature  at  the  pore-scale  can  be 

obtained by solving the steady-state heat conduction equation without a 
source term. 

In this section, the metal foam is taken as an example, which is a 
promising material for enhancing heat transfer. Krishnan, Murthy and 
Garimella  [196]  adopted  the  FVM  to  simulate  fluid  flow  and  heat 
transfer in ideal periodic metal foam structures. It was found that for 
porosity  higher  than  0.94,  the  effective  thermal  conductivity  can  be 
ε)3.  Pore-scale  modeling  based  on  the  realistic 
calculated  by  λs(1  (cid:0)
structures of metal foam was further conducted by Ranut, Nobile and 
Mancini  [197].  XCT  with  a  resolution  of  9.09  μm  was  adopted  to 
generate the realistic restructures of aluminum foams with different PPI 
(pores per inch). With the realistic structures considered, the agreement 
between the predicted effective thermal conductivity using the FVM and 
the experimental results was improved [197]. 

Pore-scale modeling also has been adopted to study convective heat 
transfer processes in porous media and to predict the heat transfer co-
efficient  [198–200].  In  such  pore-scale  simulations,  either  constant 
temperature or constant heat flux is prescribed at the wall of the solid 
matrix [200]. Fluid is injected from the inlet and is heated by the solid 
matrix  as  it  flows  through  the  porous  media.  After  the  pore-scale 
simulation  has  converged,  temperature  difference  between  the  fluid 
and solid can be obtained, and the heat flux can be calculated. Therefore, 
(cid:0) 1] can be determined according 
(cid:0) 2 K
the heat transfer coefficient h [W m
to the  Newton’s cooling low.  The relationship between  Re and h  was 
predicted in Ref. [197], and a formula for the heat transfer coefficient h 
was adopted to fit the pore-scale results. The Nu number can be further 
calculated by Nu = hd/λ where λ is the fluid thermal conductivity, and 
then the relationship for Nu~f(Re, Pr) or Colburn factor j (defined as j =
Nu/RePr1/3) can be compared with existing experimental results [196, 
201].  Nie  et  al.  conducted  pore-scale  fluid  flow  and  heat  transfer  in 
reconstructed aluminum foam of pore densities 10–50 PPI and porosities 
70–95%  using  the  Laguerre-Voronoi  tessellatio  structures,  and  found 
that the relationship between Nu and Re can be expressed as follows Nu 
= CRem (Fig. 7) [200] where C and m are the fitting parameters. Diani 
et  al.  [198]  also  conducted  pore-scale  simulations  of  convective  heat 
transfer in copper foam obtained from micro-CT with porosity of about 
94% and 5–40 PPI, and also found that the predicted relationship be-
tween Nu and Re can be well fitted by Nu = CRem. Pore-scale modeling of 
turbulent  flow  and  heat  transfer  in  metal  foam  was  also  conducted 
[202]. Since the pore-scale distributions of velocity and temperature are 
obtained, the field synergy principle also can be adopted to analyze the 
synergy  between  velocity  and  temperature  gradient,  and  further  to 
optimize the porous structures of metal foams [203]. The field synergy 
principle states that to enhance the convective heat transfer, the angle 
between the velocity vector and the temperature gradient should be as 
small as possible [204]. 

4.3. Diffusion 

Bulk diffusion has been successfully described by Fick law for binary 
diffusion and Stefan-Maxwell law for diffusion with three or more spe-
cies.  When  the  pore  characteristic  length  d  is  comparable  to  or  even 
smaller than the mean free path, Knudsen diffusion plays an important 
role. The Bosanquet equation has been widely adopted to consider ef-
fects of the Knudsen diffusion [205]

mass, and kB is the Boltzmann constant. It is mentioned Dk depends on 
the  local  pore  size  d  which  varies  spatially  inside  a  porous  medium. 
Therefore,  when  modeling  diffusion  processes  in  micro/nanoscale 
porous media in which Knudsen diffusion is important, the local pore 
size should be determined. Two main methods have been adopted for 
determining the local pore size: the largest sphere method [68], and the 
13 direction averaging method [206]. 

While the local diffusivity of a void node is described by Eq. (33), the 
effective diffusivity is defined on the entire porous medium to represent 
the  capacity  of  the  porous  medium  for  diffusion.  The  Bruggeman 
equation Deff/D=ε/τ is the most widely adopted equation for estimating 
the effective diffusivity, where τ is tortuosity, which will be discussed in 
detail in Section 4.4. In the original Bruggeman equation τ is set as εα 
with α equal to (cid:0) 0.5. Pore-scale studies have been conducted to verify 
whether Bruggeman equation is suitable for estimating effective diffu-
sivity of different porous media, and if not, to propose improved cor-
relations.  During  the  implementation  of  the  pore-scale  simulation, 
concentration gradient is applied in the direction under investigation, 
for example x direction. No-flux boundary condition is applied at the 
fluid-solid interface if there is no diffusion within the solid. With these 
boundary conditions, the pure diffusion equation, namely the Laplace 

equation, is solved using the pore-scale mass transport model. After the 
pore-scale concentration distribution is obtained, the total flux of species 
through the void space is calculated by integrating the x-component of 
the gradient ∇C over the inlet (or the outlet). This flux is set equal to an 
idealized  1-D  porous  medium  with  effective  diffusivity  Deff  and  the 
gradient of (Cx=0 (cid:0) Cx=Lx
)/Lx. The effective diffusivity Deff can then be 
determined

In this section, particle-packed porous media are employed for pore- 
scale modeling of mass transport and prediction of effective diffusivity. 
Random walking method was adopted by Berson et al. [207] to predict 
effective  diffusivity  of  3D  porous  media.  The  porous  structures  were 
generated by mixing two different types of spherical particles. Results 
show that the original Bruggeman equation overestimates the effective 
permeability at low porosity, and the Bruggeman equation is modified as 
Deff/D= 1.6ε2  for ε  lower than 0.4. Diffusion in the transition regime 
with  Knudsen  diffusion  was  also  studied.  The  results  show  that  the 
Bosanquet equation can correctly predict the effective diffusivity if the

proper characteristic length is adopted to calculate the Kn number. In 
light of increasing capabilities to manufacture anisotropic nanoparticles, 
effects  of  particle  shape  were  also  studied  by  performing  pore-scale 
modeling  [208].  More  than  1500  particle-packed  structures  with 
different  particle  shapes  (spheres,  cubic,  cuboid  and  ellipsoids,  See 
Fig.  8)  and  distributions  were  reconstructed  and  random  walking 
method was employed to predict the effective diffusivity. 

Pore-scale  modeling  also  can  predict  the  effective  conductivity  of 
electron  and  proton  by  solving  the  corresponding  transport  equation 
with the form of Laplace equation. The simulation details are similar to 
that of the effective diffusivity, and are not repeated here for brevity [70, 
209]. 

4.4. Tortuosity 

The definition of tortuosity is the ratio between the average length of 
the true transport length Le to the direct length of a porous medium L in 
the  macroscopic  transport  direction.  From  such  definition,  it  can  be 
found  that  tortuosity  depends  not  only  on  the  structures  and 
morphology of the porous medium, but also on the specific transport 
processes  studied.  In  the  literature,  different  kinds  of  tortuosity  have 
been  calculated  such  as  geometric,  hydraulic,  diffusive  and  electrical 
tortuosity, with no clear consensus on the relation between them [210, 
211]. For hydraulic tortuosity, Duta et al. [210] derived the following 
expression directly based on the fluid velocity field

where u is velocity and x denotes the direction under consideration. Due 
to its simplicity, Eq. (36) has been increasingly employed to calculate 
the  tortuosity.  There  also  have  been  many  pore-scale  studies  in  the 
literature predicting the tortuosity for the diffusion process based on the 
Bruggeman equation. Pore-scale prediction schemes for the tortuosity 
related to other transport processes, such as electron and proton con-
duction, are similar and are not repeated here for brevity. 

In  this  section,  the  Gyroid  structure  is  taken  as  an  example  (see 
Fig. 9). Gyroid is an important kind of triply periodic minimal surface 
that  has  a  mean  curvature  of  zero  at  each  point  on  the  surface.  The 
Gyroid structure presents several features such as free-standing, highly 
ordered  and  interconnected  pore  network,  and  high  specific  surface 
area, leading to both good transport and mechanical properties [212]. 
Thus, it has high potential to be used in energy conversion and storage 
devices [213]. Luo et al. [214] reconstructed the porous structures and 

performed  pore-scale  studies  of  fluid  flow,  heat  transfer  and  mass 
transport inside the Gyroid structures. The pore-scale results show that 
the hydraulic tortuosity is lower than the diffusive tortuosity for Gyroid 
structure. 

4.5. Challenges 

From  the  review  above,  it  is  clear  that  analysis  of  the  effects  of 
structural  parameters  on  the  transport  processes  and  thus  on  the 
macroscopic transport properties is a cumbersome task. It is very chal-
lenging, if possible, to propose a general formula between the macro-
scopic  transport  properties  and  the  structural  parameters  of  different 
kinds  of  porous  media.  However,  understanding  the  underlying  rela-
tionship  between  porous  structures  and  pore-scale  distributions  of 
related  physical  variables  is  important  for  controlling  the  transport 
processes and improving the performance of porous media [215,216]. 
Jin et al. [71] performed pore-scale study of fluid flow in three different 
porous media including porous foam, packed spheres and Bentheimer 
sandstone.  Two-point  correlation  function  of  the  random  porous  het-
erogeneous materials as well as the Eulerian correlation function of the 
interstitial streamwise velocity field were calculated. It was found that 
the two functions are all short ranged and decay exponentially, and the 
two functions follow the similar pattern. In Section 5, it will be found 
that compared with single-phase fluid flow, the porous structures and 
wettability have more sophisticated effects on the multiphase flow, and 
understanding interactions between porous structures, surface charac-
teristics and pore-scale multiphase distributions and dynamic behaviors 
are very important. 

5. Application in the geoscience 

5.1. Multiphase flow in subsurface porous media 

Multiphase  flow  in  porous  media  is  very  common  in  a  lot  of 
geophysical processes, such as oil and gas extraction from porous rocks, 
carbon dioxide (CO2) injection and storage in saline aquifers or hydro-
carbon reservoirs, remediation of groundwater polluted by non-aqueous 
phase  liquid  (NAPL),  etc.  [34,217].  For  multiphase  flow  in  porous 
media, different fluid phases share the same complex pore space. The 
dynamic  flow  behavior  and  the  distribution  of  different  phases  are 
affected  by  multiple  factors  including  wettability,  capillary  number, 
viscosity ratio and even flow processes (imbibition and drainage) [34], 
making it a challenging task to describe this phenomenon. 

At the continuum-scale, a modified form of Darcy’s law, the so-called

extended  Darcy’s  law,  is  usually  used  to  describe  multiphase  flow  in 
porous  media  by  introducing  the  relative  permeability.  Taking  gas- 
liquid  two  phase  flow  in  porous  media  as  an  example,  the  governing 
equations for gas and liquid flow are described as follows 

um = (cid:0)

k0kr,m
μm

(∇Pm + Fm)

(37)  

where  the  subscript  m  = g  or  l,  represents  the  gas  or  liquid  phase, 
respectively. u is the velocity, k0  the intrinsic permeability and kr  the 
relative permeability. The driving forces include the pressure gradient 
term  ∇P  and  gravity  term  F. The  pressures  of  non-wetting  (e.g.,  gas) 
phase  (Pg)  and  wetting  (e.g.,  liquid)  phase  (Pl)  are  coupled  by  the 
capillary pressure Pc(Sw) = Pg  (cid:0) Pl. Both the relative permeability and 
capillary pressure are assumed to be only dependent on saturation [11], 
which are usually obtained by physical experiments or empirical models 

[26,218]. 

Eq.  (37)  combined  with  the  continuity  equation  supplemented  by 
capillary pressure curve have been widely used to simulate two-phase 
flow  in  porous  media  at  the  continuum  scale,  which  is  the  basis  of 
macroscale reservoir simulation in petroleum engineering. Even though 
these  continuum-scale  models  have  been  routinely  applied  in  engi-
neering, shortcomings of the models have been long recognized. First, it 
is assumed that both fluids flow in their own channels and there is no 
interaction between them. The fluid-fluid interface is regarded as solid 
wall  ignoring  viscous  coupling  effect  [27,219,220].  Second,  both  the 
relative permeability and capillary pressure curves are assumed to be 
only  dependent  on  saturation  [221].  However,  different  multiphase 
morphologies can be formed at the same saturation under different flow 
conditions  or  processes  (drainage  and  imbibition)  [222],  yielding 
different  values  of  relative  permeability  and  capillary  pressure,  for

example  the  well-known  hysteresis  phenomenon  [223,224].  All  these 
dynamic multiphase interactions happening at the pore scale cannot be 
captured by the Darcy-scale two-phase flow model. The pore-scale ex-
periments  and  modeling  have  great  advantages  in  improving  our  un-
derstanding  of  multiphase  flow  in  porous  media  as  the  details  of 
velocity, pressure and phase distributions inside the pore space can be 
obtained and analyzed. 

It is worth mentioning that the Darcy-scale two-phase flow model 
and  pore-scale  numerical  simulation  are  complementary  methods  at 
different scales. The Darcy-scale two-phase flow model are applied at 
the engineering scale to solve practical problems. But it has some limi-
tations in theory which could be explained by the pore-scale modeling. 
On  the  other  hand,  although  the  pore-scale  modeling  can  reveal  the 
fundamental physics happening inside the porous media, the simulation 
results  usually  could  not  be  directly  used  in  practical  applications 
without upscaling into the Darcy-scale model. In this section, we focus 
on the recent developments of pore-scale modeling of multiphase flow in 
porous media in geoscience applications. 

5.1.1. Relative permeability 

The relative permeability and capillary pressure curve are the most 
important properties characterizing two-phase flow in porous media at 
the  continuum  scale.  Influences  of  different  parameters,  including 
capillary  number  (Ca)  [27,225-227],  viscosity  ratio  [27,226-228], 
wettability [27,226-229] and wettability heterogeneity [229–232], on 
the  relative  permeability  have  been  extensively  studied  by  pore-scale 
modeling, but the conclusions are quite complex. Taking the influence 
of wettability on non-wetting phase relative permeability as an example, 
with the decrease of wetting phase contact angle, Ghassemi et al. [228], 
Li et al. [27] and Zhao et al. [227] observed an increase in non-wetting 
phase relative permeability, mainly because the non-wetting phase oc-
cupies more large flowing channels, which yields smaller resisting force 
by the solids. While Landry et al. [229] found a decrease in non-wetting 
phase  relative  permeability  as  the  non-wetting  phase  becomes  more 
disconnected, which results in a larger capillary force. A detailed review 
of the influences of these different parameters on relative permeability is 
not  the  focus  of  this  paper.  Rather,  we  will  show  how  the  pore-scale 
modeling can improve our understanding of multiphase flow in porous 
media in general. As the detailed phase and velocity distributions inside 
the pore space can be obtained by pore-scale modeling, it allows us to 
analyze the multiphase flow mechanisms from the pore-scale perspec-
tive.  One  typical  example is  shown in  Fig.  10.  The simulation  results 
showed that the relative permeability of both phases increase with Ca, as 
shown in Fig. 10(i). With pore-scale simulation, we can easily observe 
that  the  trapping  non-wetting  phase  under  low  Ca  can  be  mobilized 
under high Ca, as highlighted by black arrows in Fig. 10(a)–(h), which 
results in more flowing paths for both phases and increases the relative 
permeability. 

The  above  studies  clearly  show  that  the  relative  permeability  of 
multiphase flow in porous media is not a unique function of saturation 
but is also determined by the complex microscale phase morphology. 
The  phase  morphology  is  strongly  dependent  on  the  fluid  properties, 
fluid-solid interactions, porous structures [228,233] and even the flow 
processes  [234].  It  is  understandable  that  no  easy  conclusions  were 
obtained. The pore-scale modeling has been further used to explore the 
relationship  between  relative  permeability  and  microscale  phase 
morphology. Based on a thermodynamic approach, Hassanizadeh et al. 
[235] developed an improved description of two-phase flow in porous 
media by incorporating the interface dynamics, which was validated by 
pore network simulations [236]. Through LBM simulations, Li et al. [27] 
and Zhao et al. [232] also evaluated the influence of specific interfacial 
area  on  relative  permeability  and  concluded  that  the  relative  perme-
ability  decreases  as  the  specific  interfacial  area  increases  due  to  the 
larger capillary force. The interfacial area carries additional information 
of phase morphology and is helpful to analyze the influences of different 
parameters on relative permeability [225]. 

The phase connectivity is also an important variable to determine the 
relative permeability, which can be characterized by the Euler charac-
teristic  by  counting  the  fluid  clusters  and  inherent  loops.  Armstrong 
et al. [237] found that a higher Ca results in a more connected phase 
morphology and smaller Euler characteristic, leading to an increase in 
relative  permeability  for  non-wetting  phase.  They  suggested  to  use 
interfacial  area  and  Euler  characteristic  to  describe  the  phase 
morphology, which should be introduced into the Darcy scale two-phase 
flow  model.  This  was  also  demonstrated  by  Liu  et  al.  [238].  Recent 
pore-scale  studies  showed  that  different  phase  morphologies  can  be 
formed under different Ca, resulting in different relationships between 
pressure gradient (∇P) and total flow rate (or capillary number) ∇P ~ 
[239].  Under  a  very  low  Ca  the  exponent  α=1.0  and  the  linear 
Ca
extended Darcy’s law is in general valid [240]. In an intermittent flow 
regime when the capillary and viscous forces are comparable the pore 
space is intermittently occupied by the two fluids and the exponent α 
becomes 0<α<1 [240]. While under a high Ca when the flow is domi-
nated  by  viscous  force  the  exponent  α  becomes  1.0  again  [241].  By 
incorporating these different pore-scale flow regimes Picchi et al. [242] 
developed  a  semi-empirical  Darcy  scale  two-phase  flow  model  which 
showed good consistency with the simulation results of Armstrong et al. 
[237]. This demonstrated the importance of pore-scale phase distribu-
tion on relative permeability and provided a way to consider it in the 
continuum-scale model. 

α 

In  addition  to  two-phase  relative  permeability,  the  pore-scale 
modeling  has also been  used  to calculate  the  relative permeability  of 
three-phase  flow  in  porous  media,  which  is  much  more  difficult  to 
measure  by  experiments.  With  LBM  simulations,  the  influences  of 
different factors on three-phase relative permeability were analyzed by 
Zhang  et  al.  [243]  and  Zhu  et  al.  [244].  The  accuracy  of  different 
theoretical models to predict the three-phase relative permeability was 
evaluated by Jiang et al. [245] based on the pore-scale results. 

5.1.2. Capillary pressure-saturation relationship 

In an early attempt, Pan et al. [223] evaluated the accuracy of the 
LBM  in  predicting  the  Pc-Sw  relationship  in  a  sphere-packing  porous 
medium by comparing with experimental results. Noteworthy is that the 
hysteresis of Pc-Sw relationships was well captured by LBM, as shown in 
Fig. 11. Similar comparison work was reported by Schaap et al. [224]. As 
the pore-scale phase distributions can be directly obtained in the LBM, 
fluid  trapping  observed  in  Fig.  11(f)  [223]  and  different  saturation 
profiles during drainage and imbibition processes [224] were analyzed, 
allowing  analysis  of  possible  reasons  for  hysteresis  in  Pc-Sw  relation-
ships. Pore-scale modeling has also been widely used to investigate the 
influences  of  different  factors  on  capillary  pressure  curve,  such  as 
wettability [231,246] and non-equilibrium effect [247,248]. 

To eliminate the hysteresis in Pc-Sw relationship, Hassanizadeh and 
Gray [249] proposed that the  capillary pressure  is a  function of both 
saturation  and  specific  interfacial  area  (Anw)  based  on  the  thermody-
namic approach, which results in a unique Pc-Sw-Anw  relationship. To 
validate this theory, Porter et al. [221] used a multi-component Shan--
Chen  LB  model  to  explore  the  Pc-Sw-Anw  relationship  for  two-phase 
displacement in porous media. The hysteresis phenomenon was found 
in  both  Pc-Sw  and  Sw-Anw  relationships,  but  a  unique  Pc-Sw-Anw  rela-
tionship  was  observed  in  both  drainage  and  imbibition  processes. 
Although the Pc-Sw-Anw relationship is more reasonable, the uniqueness 
of  this  relationship  has  been  further  studied.  Both  the  dynamic  pore 
network simulations [250] and microscale experiments [251] showed 
that a unique Pc-Sw-Anw curve exists during the drainage and imbibition 
processes  under  the  same  Ca.  However,  the  curves  obtained  under 
different  Ca  deviate  from  each  other  because  of  the  non-equilibrium 
effect  under  high  Ca,  which  makes  the  non-wetting  phase  more 
disconnected  and  breaks  the  hypothesis  of  the  thermodynamic 
approach. Li et al. [252] also obtained a unique Pc-Sw-Anw relationship 
for the drainage and imbibition processes, but it cannot be applied to the 
infiltration  process.  Schlüter  et  al.  [253]  reported  that  the  Euler

characteristic (χ) carries complementary information of fluid topology 
on flow patterns, and is capable to explain the hysteresis in interfacial 
areas  between  different  processes.  This  was  also  demonstrated  by 
McClure et al. [254], who evaluated the uniqueness of Pc-Sw, Pc-Sw-Anw 
and Pc-Sw-Anw -χn relationships based on a new approach to describe the 
interfacial equilibrium states considering the disconnected non-wetting 
phase clusters. The results showed that by adding both Anw  and χ  the 
hysteresis in the capillary pressure relationship can be removed. 

Most  of  the  pore-scale  studies  focus  on  the  static  or  equilibrium 
capillary pressure (Pc,sta) under low flow rate. If the fluid flow rate be-
comes  higher,  the  dynamic  or  non-equilibrium  effect  becomes  non- 
negligible,  resulting  in  a  dynamic  capillary  pressure  (Pc,dyn)  between 
the two phases, which is related to Pc,sta by Pc,dyn = Pc,sta (cid:0) τdyn(∂Sw/∂t) 
[249],  where  τdyn  is  the  dynamic  coefficient.  The  dynamic  capillary 
pressure  has  been  studied  by  both  the  dynamic  pore  network  model 
[255,256]  and  the  LBM  [247,248].  The  results  showed  that  τdyn  is 
dependent on Sw. With the increase of viscosity ratio and decrease of 

wetting phase contact angle, τdynincreases [247]. In addition, τdynalso 
showed hysteresis during the drainage and imbibition processes [255, 
256]. The underlying mechanisms require further pore-scale study. 

5.1.3.

Immiscible two-phase displacement 

Immiscible two-phase displacement includes drainage when a wet-
ting  fluid  is  displaced  by  a  non-wetting  fluid,  and  imbibition  when  a 
non-wetting fluid is displaced by a wetting fluid. Under different flow 
rates,  viscosity  ratios,  wettability  conditions  and  porous  geometries, 
different flow patterns can be observed during two-phase displacement. 
Lenormand  et  al.  [257]  divided  the  displacement  patterns  during 
drainage  process  into  three  types  according  to  Ca  and  viscosity  ratio 
between  non-wetting  and  wetting  phase  (M),  namely  stable  displace-
ment which happens under high Ca and high M, viscous fingering which 
happens  under  high  Ca  and  small  M,  and  capillary  fingering  which 
happens under small Ca. Pore-scale simulations have been extensively 
used to reproduce the different displacement patterns and analyze the

skeleton are shown in blue and gray, respectively. Reprinted from Ref. [259] with permission of Nature Publishing Group. (For interpretation of the references to 
colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) 

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience88(2022)10096818L. Chen et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    

microscale  displacement  mechanisms  [258–262],  and  one  example  is 
shown in Fig. 12. As can be seen, in the viscous fingering regime some 
preferential and thin non-wetting flowing paths can develop from the 
inlet to outlet. In the capillary fingering regime the non-wetting fluid 
seeks  the  largest  path  to  invade  which  has  the  minimum  capillary 
pressure.  While  in  the  stable  displacement  regime,  the  non-wetting 
phase shows a more compact displacement front and yields the high-
est drainage efficiency [259]. In addition to Ca and M, the Bond number 
(Bo) also influences the displacement pattern. For the drainage process 
of  gas  displacing  liquid,  increasing  Bo  can  stabilize  the  displacement 
front  [263].  It  should  be  noted  that  the  boundaries  of  different 
displacement patterns for drainage process obtained by different simu-
lations and experiments were not identical, which may be caused by the 
different porous geometries [260,263]. 

The  wettability  also  has  significant  influence  on  the  displacement 
pattern. It was found that decreasing the invading fluid contact angle 
makes the displacement pattern more compact above a critical value (θc 
= π /2 (cid:0) α /2, where α  is  the  corner angle)  [35,264,265], due  to the 
increase of cooperative pore filling. If the invading fluid contact angle is 
smaller than θc, meaning strong imbibition process, wetting phase layers 
could develop in the corners in front of the main meniscus under a small 
displacement  rate  [266],  leading  to  a  more  complex  displacement 
pattern  [265,267].  Most  pore-scale  numerical  studies  on  imbibition 
process were based on theoretical models of simple patterned geome-
tries  [264,268]  or  simplified  pore  network  models  [269,270].  The 
complex  porous  structure  makes  the  displacement  pattern  more 
complicated for real porous media, especially under strong imbibition 
condition, which needs further study [271]. 

In  addition  to  the  viscous  and  capillary  forces,  the  significance  of 
inertial force on two-phase displacement has been recognized. Zachar-
oudiou  et  al.  [272]  analyzed  the  local  two-phase  dynamics  near  the 
region where Haines jump takes place. It was found that the Haines jump 
event is very quick when the inertial force becomes important, which 
usually  causes  local  pressure  and  phase  redistributions,  such  as  local 
imbibition or snap-off phenomenon [272,273]. Ferrari et al. [274] and 
Zacharoudiou  et  al.  [275]  found  that  the  pore-filling  event  during 
low-rate imbibition process could be very fast due to the sudden surface 
energy  release.  The  pore  filling  process  is  determined  by  not  only 
capillary number and viscosity ratio, but also Ohnesorge number, which 
characterizes  the  relative  importance  of  viscous  over  inertial  and 
capillary  forces.  Recently,  Chen  et  al.  [154]  studied  the  influence  of 
inertial force on the drainage displacement pattern in a real 3D digital 
rock under different flow conditions. More flowing pathways (fingers) 
were observed under stronger inertial effects with the same Ca. 

5.1.4. Other practical applications 

The pore-scale numerical simulation also has some specific practical 

applications. In CO2 geological sequestration, capillary trapping of CO2 
ganglia and clusters can be quantified by the drainage and subsequent 
imbibition  simulations.  Jiang  et  al.  [276]  analyzed  the  influence  of 
interfacial tension (IFT) on CO2 trapping and found that higher IFT leads 
to more CO2 trapping and larger trapping clusters, as shown in Fig. 13. 
In addition, the capillary trapping is more stable under high IFT due to 
the larger capillary force. The influence of initial CO2 distribution before 
the imbibition process was also analyzed [277]. It was found that the 
higher connectivity and sphericity index (which represents the similar-
ity  to  a  sphere)  of  initial  CO2  clusters  resulted  in  less  residual  CO2 
capillary  trapping.  Bakhshian  et  al.  [231]  studied  the  influence  of 
wettability heterogeneity on CO2 trapping. As the CO2-wet solid surfaces 
were randomly generated in their work, more CO2-wet regions resulted 
in more clusters and less connectivity of the trapped CO2 phase. These 
pore-scale studies are very helpful to optimize the operating strategies 
for CO2 sequestration. 

In  petroleum  engineering,  pore-scale  simulation  is  also  helpful  to 
understand  the  enhanced  oil  recovery  mechanisms.  Akai  et  al.  [278] 
used  the  LBM  to  simulate  two-phase  flow  coupled  with  ion  transport 
equations to study the low salinity water-flooding of oil in porous media, 
taking  into  account  the  wettability  alteration  caused  by  ion  adsorp-
tion/desorption on solid surface. The results showed that the timing to 
inject the low-salinity water has a significant influence on the final fluid 
configuration.  Xie  et  al.  [279]  developed  a  LB  model  for  multiphase 
viscoplastic fluid flow to account for polymer solutions and adopted this 
model  to  simulate  non-Newtonian  fluid  displacement  in  different  2D 
porous media. The shear-thickening fluid shows better performance in 
oil  recovery  compared  with  shear-thinning  fluid  as  the  former  has  a 
stronger 
from 
higher-permeability  layer  to  lower-permeability  layer.  They  also 
extended  this  model  to  three-phase  flow,  in  order  to  investigate  the 
enhanced oil recovery mechanism of dispersed polymer flooding [280]. 
Wei et al. [281] used the Shan-Chen LBM to simulate multiphase flow 
and characterized the amphiphilic structure of surfactant with a dipole 
to study the mechanisms of surfactant flooding. The influences of sur-
factant on droplet deformation, droplets detaching from the solid walls 
and passing through the narrow throats, as well as two-phase displace-
ment in porous media were analyzed based on the proposed model.

5.2. Reactive transport with solid structure evolution in porous media 

Reactive transport processes with evolution of the solid structures of 
porous  media  are  also  very  common  in  geoscience,  such  as  geologic 
sequestration of carbon dioxide [282], acid injection for enhanced oil 
recovery [283], biofilm growth in aqueous environment [284], nuclear 
fuel disposal [33], etc. The origin of the solid structure evolution can be 
different, such as dissolution/precipitation caused by chemical reaction,

melting/solidification caused by heat transfer, or particle migration and 
agglomerates. Such solid structure evolution is significantly affected by 
the pore-scale transport processes, which in turn controls the domain for 
the transport processes [285]. Besides accurately simulating the multi-
ple transport processes and reactions in the porous media, the pore-scale 
modeling  should  also  precisely  describe  the  dynamic  change  of  the 
fluid-solid interface. Different numerical schemes have been employed 
for capturing/tracking the fluid-solid interface, such as the cellular au-
tomaton  (CA)  method,  the  VOF,  the  LS,  the  phase  field  method,  etc. 
[286]. 

Since the pioneering work of B´ekri et al. [287], pore-scale modeling 
has been devoted to study the strong interaction between the reactive 
transport  processes  and  the  solid  structure  evolution  under  different 
conditions. Kang et al. [128,288] adopted the LBM to simulate reactive 
transport  with  solid  structure  evolution,  with  the  cellular  automaton 
(CA)  method  for  updating  the  solid  structures.  Different  dissolution 
patterns  were  identified  under  different  Pe  number  (P´eclet  number, 
representing  the  relative  strength  of  convection  to  diffusion)  and  Da 
number  (Damk¨ohler number,  representing the  relative strength  of  re-
action  to  diffusion),  including homogeneous  dissolution,  face  dissolu-
tion and the channeling. Such complicated dissolution behaviors lead to 
complex relationship between the porosity and permeability [128,288]. 
The dissolution or precipitation processes was also investigated at the 
pore scale by Li et al. [289] using a projection method to solve the fluid 
flow and the level set method to track the solid-fluid interface, by Luo 
et  al.  [290]  using  a  diffuse  interface  method  to  track  the  solid-fluid 
interface,  and  by  Tartakovsky  et  al.  [291]  adopting the  SPH  method. 
Szymczak  and  Ladd  [292]  conducted  comprehensive  pore-scale 
modeling to identify the reactive transport conditions for forming the 
channel  dissolution  phenomena.  In  addition,  Jiang  and  Tsuji  [293] 
performed 3D pore-scale modeling of carbonate precipitation in a real 
Berea  sandstone  sample,  where  the  LBM  was  adopted  for  simulating 
fluid  flow  and  the  FVM  for  advection-reaction  processes.  The  perme-
ability decreases with reduced porosity due to the precipitation. Under 
the same porosity, the macroscopic transport properties of the porous 
media, such as the permeability, can differ by orders of magnitude for 
different  dissolution/precipitation  processes  under  various  reactive 
transport  conditions  [23–25].  Failing  to  take  into  account  such 
pore-scale  heterogeneity  or  the  different  porosity-permeability  re-
lationships will cause unacceptable error when predicting the transport 
behaviors of the porous media. In reality, the solid phase of the porous 
media sometimes consists of multiple constituents, the dissolution rate 
of which may be quite different. Effects of the undissolved constituents 
on the reactive transport processes were investigated at the pore-scale 
[294,295].  The  undissolved  constituent  forms  porous  layers  and  sup-
press the formation of the channel dissolution pattern [294]. Liu et al. 
[296] further performed 3D pore-scale modeling of reactive transport in 
multi-mineral rocks with rock dissolution, as shown in Fig. 14. The 3D 

structures obtained from XCT contain eight mineral constituents with 
different dissolution reaction rate. It was found that without considering 
the  multiple  minerals,  the  overall  reaction  rate  was  remarkably 
overestimated. 

The recent trend of pore-scale modeling of transport processes with 
solid  structure  evolution  is  to  further  take  into  account  the  effects  of 
multiphase flow [38]. Accurately tracking the liquid-gas-solid interfaces 
in  such  multiphase  reactive  transport  processes  with  solid  structure 
evolution poses great challenges for the pore-scale modeling, and cor-
responding studies are scarce in the literature [31,33,291,297]. Parmi-
giani et al. used the LBM to study the injection process of a non-wetting 
fluid into a wetting fluid coupled with dynamic evolution of the solid 
geometries. The solid structure was changed due to melting [31]. Chen 
et al. [33] proposed a pore-scale model based on the LBM for simulating 
coupled  multiphase  reactive  transport  and  dissolution-precipitation 
processes. The model was then applied to study the thermal migration 
of a brine inclusion in a salt crystal during the nuclear waste disposal, as 
shown in Fig. 15. The pore-scale modeling provided a sound explanation 
of the thermal migration of the brine inclusion observed at the macro-
scale.  In  another  work,  Chen  et  al.  [297]  further  extended  their 
pore-scale model to multicomponent reactive transport processes. Sun 
et al. [298] developed a pore-scale model by coupling the MRT-LBM and 
CA methods to study dendritic growth and bubble formation. Important 
physical  phenomena  were  successfully  captured  by  the  pore-scale 
modeling including the nucleation of bubbles at the liquid/solid inter-
face and the precipitation of small bubbles in the inter-dendritic region. 
Very recently, Soulaine et al.  [47] also developed a pore-scale  model 
based on the FVM method for the dissolution of the calcite crystal and 
the production of the CO2 bubbles during the acidizing process. 

5.3. Challenges 

There are still some challenges that need be addressed to investigate 
multiphase  flow  and  reactive  transport  phenomena  in  porous  media. 
First of all, as demonstrated by different studies, the important macro-
scale  properties  characterizing  multiphase  flow  in  porous  media  are 
determined  by  the  detailed  pore-scale  phase  distributions.  However, 
none of the current continuum-scale models can take into account all the 
pore-scale information. It remains a challenging task to explore the exact 
relationship  between  macroscale  transport  properties  and  microscale 
phase distribution. Second, most pore-scale numerical studies on two- 
phase  displacement  in  porous  media  focus  on  the  drainage  process. 
The imbibition, especially the strong imbibition in angular porous media 
with corner films remains less understood [265]. The competition be-
tween  corner  film  flow  and  main  meniscus  flow  makes  the  strong 
imbibition process  much more complex. Extremely high resolution of 
the digital porous medium is required in order to fully resolve the corner 
film flow, which renders the direct pore-scale numerical study of this

problem computationally impossible [35]. Finally, the multiphase flow 
in subsurface porous media is usually coupled with different physical 
and/or chemical processes [33,281]. Development of a robust pore-scale 
numerical model which can accurately couple all these transport pro-
cesses and interfacial phenomena is highly required. 

6. Application in the proton exchange membrane fuel cell 

Porous  electrodes  have  been  widely  adopted  to  enhance  transport 
processes and to promote the electrochemical reactions in fuel cells such 
as PEMFCs, the SOFCs and the direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs). For 
example,  inside  PEMFCs,  the  gas  diffusion  layer  (GDL),  microscopic 
porous  layer  (MPL)  and  CL  are  all  porous  medium  with  complicated 
porous structures [299]. Complex physical-electrical-chemical processes 
simultaneously  occur  in  these  porous  components.  In  this  and  next 
section, pore-scale modeling work of reactive transport phenomena in 
the porous electrodes of PEMFC and SOFC is reviewed. These studies can 
shed  some  light  on  reactive  transport  phenomena  in  other  electro-
chemical devices, such as vanadium redox flow batteries, Li-ion battery, 
DMFC, etc. 

6.1. Gas diffusion layer 

The widely adopted GDL is carbon fiber-based porous medium, with 
typical diameter of 6–10 μm, GDL thickness of 100–300 μm, porosity of 
0.6–0.9  and  pore  size  of  10–100  μm  [64].  The  most  widely  adopted 
carbon  paper  GDL  shows  high  anisotropy  between  in-plane  (IP)  and 
through-plane (TP) directions as the carbon fibers are placed layer by 
layer. On the whole, the GDL is characterized as thin, heterogeneous and 
anisotropic porous media. Inside the GDL, air-water two phase flow with 
phase  change,  mass  transport,  heat  transfer  and  electron  conduction 
processes  simultaneously  take  place.  Particularly,  the  liquid  water 
generated inside the cathode CL is required to be drained through the 
GDL to the gas channel (GC), as excessive liquid water in the GDL will 
block the pores and hinder the gas transport, causing water flooding. 
The  GDL  is  naturally  hydrophilic. To  enhance its  hydrophobicity and 
thus  to  enhance  water  removal  from  GDL,  hydrophobic  polytetra-
fluoroethylene (PTFE) coating is added. 

In 1999, Wang et al. [300] developed a continuum-scale multiphase 
flow model for porous electrodes of the PEMFCs based on the extended 
Darcy law (the details can be found in Section 5). In such model, the 
capillary pressure-saturation Pc-S relationship is adopted for two-phase 
flow in GDL. Because accurate expression of Pc-S relationship for GDL is 
lacking at that time, the Leverett-Udell function obtained from homo-
geneous  sand  pack  is  adopted,  which  nowadays  has  been  routinely 
adopted [26,301]. There are many concerns about such continuum-scale 
models for GDL, including the inaccuracy of the Leverett-Udell function 
[302,303],  the  inexistence  of  the  REV  along  the  thickness  direction 
[161,304,305], and the failure of predicting the fractal invasion patterns 
of  capillary  fingering  in  GDL  [305,306].  Therefore,  started  in  about 
2007  [307–309],  researchers  have  resorted  to  pore-scale  studies  to 

better understand the underlying multiphase flow and mass transport 
inside the GDL. Among the large number of pore-scale numerical studies 
in the literature, the majority were performed by the LBM [39]. 

6.1.1. Multiphase flow in GDL 

the  water  saturation  curve  along 

In  the  hydrophobic  GDL,  following  the  capillary  fingering  mecha-
nisms, the liquid water will always choose the largest pore to advance 
because the local resistance is the lowest [309–314]. With the capillary 
fingering  mechanism, 
the 
through-plane direction of GDL shows the concave shape [312]. After 
breakthrough of the GDL, liquid water will form droplets at the GDL/GC 
interface  at  random  and  preferential  locations.  In  Ref.  [314],  liquid 
water breakthrough behavior through 22 stochastic reconstructed GDL 
was studied at the pore-scale (Fig. 16(a)). Distances between different 
breakthrough locations were analyzed in detail, and it was found that 
the distances can be described by the normal distribution function. Note 
that  for  the  capillary  fingering  process,  the  dominant  force  is  the 
capillary force, and effects of other forces (viscous, inertial and gravi-
tational force) can be neglected. Thus, it is quite common in the litera-
ture  that  the  density  ratio  and  viscosity  ratio  are  set  as  unity  when 
conducting the pore-scale numerical studies of the multiphase flow in 
the  GDL,  because  the  fluid  density  and  viscosity  ratio  only  affect  the 
viscous, inertial, gravitational force [309-312,315]. 

The GDL often shows mixed wettability. For a GDL with hydrophilic 
wettability, the flow pattern changes to stable displacement rather than 
the  capillary  fingering  [312,313,316,317].  Pore-scale  studies  indicate 
that water saturation inside GDL is reduced and thus water flooding in 
the  GDL  is  alleviated  by  optimizing  the  PTFE  distributions  inside  the 
GDL. Hao and Cheng [312] found that by adding a hydrophilic columnar 
through  the  GDL,  liquid  water  will  migrate  through  the  GDL  by  the 
hydrophilic  columnar,  leaving  the  remaining  hydrophobic  part  avail-
able for the reactant gas (Fig. 16(b)). Shakerinejad et al. [318] found 
that  by  changing  the  GDL  near  the  GDL/GC  interface  as  hydrophilic, 
water breakthrough time as well as water saturation inside the GDL can 
be greatly reduced. Yu et al. [319] found that distributing more PTFE 
near the CL/GDL interface or near both the CL/GDL and the GDL/GC 
interface  is  desirable  for  reducing  the  liquid  water  saturation  and 
facilitating the reactant gas transport. It can be found that the conclu-
sions of Shakerinejad et al. [318] and Yu et al. [319] are contradictory. 
Therefore, more pore-scale studies should be conducted to investigate 
the effects of the PTFE distributions as well as the coupling interaction 
between PTFE distribution and the local porous structures. 

Besides the wettability, compression of GDL also plays an important 
role in the transport processes in the GDL. X-ray has been adopted to 
investigate  the  morphology  change  of  GDL  under  compression.  Pore- 
scale  studies  indicate  that  effects  of  the  non-homogeneous  compres-
sion are significant [320,321]. It was found that the transport properties 
of GDL under the GC differ from that under the rib [320]. Two-phase 
flow in compressed GDL was also studied [322]. It was found that as 
compression ratio increases, the location of water breaking through the 
GDL  moves  from  the  channel  to  the  channel/rib  interface.  Under

relatively high compression ratio, liquid water tends to form water film 
inside GDL, which greatly hinders the reactant mass transport. 

6.1.2. Prediction of macroscopic transport properties 

Both in-plane and through-plane permeability of the GDL have been 
predicted  using  the  pore-scale  models.  Hao  and  Cheng  [86]  adopted 
MRT LBM to simulate single-phase flow in 3D reconstructed GDL with 
different PTFE content and compression ratio. It was found that due to 
the layered structures of the carbon fiber GDL, the in-plane permeability 
is relatively higher than the through-plane permeability. The values of 
permeability  predicted  agree  well  with  experimental  results  [323]. 
Based  on  the  pore-scale  flow  field,  the  tortuosity  was  also  calculated 
[86]. Effects of compression [86,176,324] and pore heterogeneity [325] 
also have been studied by the pore-scale modeling. Effective diffusivity, 
electron conductivity and thermal conductivity of GDL play important 
roles in the transfer of reactant gas, electrons and heat, and pore-scale 
simulations also have been carried out to predict these transport prop-
erties  [326–330].  While  Bruggeman  equation  has  been  commonly 
adopted  to  estimate  the  effective  diffusivity  of  GDL  in  the  literature, 
pore-scale studies indicate that the original Bruggeman equation over-
estimates the effective transport properties, and a higher exponent in the 
Bruggeman  should  be  adopted  [326,327].  Espinozae  Andaluz  et  al. 
[327]  further  compared  five  different  correlations  to  estimate  the 
through-plane diffusivity of the GDL. 

As to relative permeability for multiphase flow, Niu et al. adopted the 

LB to study multiphase flow in GDL [308]. It was found that for a hy-
drophobic  GDL,  increasing  the  contact  angle  leads  to  lower  relative 
permeability  of  the  non-wetting  phase,  namely  the  liquid  water.  As 
mentioned in Section 5.1, there exist competitive factors which affect 
two-phase  dynamic  behaviors  and  distributions  in  porous  media. 
Consequently,  it  was  found  that  below  a  threshold  water  saturation, 
relative  permeability  of  liquid  water  increases  as  PTFE  content  de-
creases, while the opposite trend occurs above the threshold saturation 
[317]. 

The Pc-S relationship is highly required to close the continuum-scale 
models.  Using  the  free-energy  LB  model,  Hao  and  Cheng  [303]  con-
ducted both  pore-scale  simulations and  experiments  to determine  the 
Pc-S relationship in GDL. It was found that in both drainage and imbi-
bition processes the Pc-S curves cross the zero Pc line due to the mixed 
wettability. The Leverett-Udell function, however, always leads to pos-
itive pressure for drainage process and negative pressure for imbibition 
process.  A  modified  J(S)  function  was  thus  proposed  based  on  the 
pore-scale results. Recently, Niu et al. [331] adopted VOF to simulate 
two-phase flow in reconstructed GDL and to predict the Pc-S relationship 
in GDL with different distributions of PTFE. 

Due  to  the  lack  of  scale  separation  between  pore  size  and  GDL 
thickness, there have been few pore-scale studies to identify the exis-
tence  of  REV  in  GDL.  Gao  et  al.  [304]  adopted  the  LBM  to  predict 
permeability  of  large  samples  of  carbon-paper  GDL  and  carbon  cloth 
GDL obtained from X-ray. The pore-scale results proved the existence of

the GDL REV for fluid flow. On the other hand, García-Salaberri [161] 
performed pore-scale studies of flow, mass transport, heat transfer and 
electron conduction in porous structures of GDL obtained by X-ray. It 
was found that in the through-plane direction, REV does not exist. In 
addition, based on the pore-scale results of water distributions in GDL 
obtained  from  XCT,  García-Salaberri  et  al.  [332]  also  performed 
pore-scale  simulations  of  mass  transport  in  partially-saturated  GDL 
(Fig.  17).  It  was  found  that  the  effective  diffusivity  is  significantly 
affected by local distributions of water inside the GDL. The following 
equation was adopted for fitting the effective diffusivity under different 
water saturation: 

Deff
Dbulk

=

Deff,dry
Dbulk

Deff,wet
Deff,dry

= f (ε)g(S)

(38)  

where f(ε) denotes the effects of porous structures without water and g 
(S)represents the effects of water, which can be expressed as following 
formula: 
g(S) = (1 (cid:0) S)n

(39) 

It was found that n for the entire domain including the invasion face 
with high saturation is as high as 7.5, while that for the domain with the 
invasion face excluded varies from 4.5 to 1.5. Such results indicate that 
water distribution with high local heterogeneity causes quite different 
local transport properties, which further questions the existence of the 
REV. It is worth mentioning that the concept of REV is the foundation of 
the widely adopted continuum-scale cell models for multiple physical- 
thermal-electrical-chemical processes inside the PEMFCs. The possible 
nonexistence  of  the  REV  for  the  thin  porous  electrodes  indicates  the 
breakdown of current continuum-scale cell models and brand-new cell- 
scale models should be developed which do not depend on REV [305, 
333,334]. 

6.2. Catalyst layer 

The CL in PEMFCs is where electrochemical reactions take place and 
the chemical energy is converted to the electrical energy. To construct 
the triple-phase-boundary (TPB) for electrochemical reactions, multiple 
components coexist inside CLs. Currently, the commonly used CL con-
sists  of  carbon  for  electron  conduction,  Nafion  ionomer  for  proton 
migration, Pt particles as the catalyst, and void space for reactant gas 

and produced water, as shown in Fig. 18 [78]. The typical thickness of 
CLs is about 10~30 μm, and the porosity is 0.3~0.6. Usually the primary 
carbon  particles  have  a  size  of  about  20~50  nm,  which  further  form 
carbon  agglomerates  of  about  100–600  nm.  The  thin  ionomer  film 
covering on the C/Pt surface has typical thickness of a few nanometers 
[50,335-338]. Between and inside the agglomerates, pore network with 
nano-, meso‑ and macro-scale pores are formed. Such multiscale pore 
network is of great importance for the transport of reactants and prod-
ucts.  To  reduce  Pt  loading  and  thus  to  save  the  cell  cost,  it  is  highly 
required to enhance transport inside CL and thus to improve the utili-
zation of Pt catalyst. To this end, the microscopic structures of carbon, 
Pt,  ionomer  and  pores  inside  CL  should  be  optimized  to  reduce  the 
transport resistance to the Pt surface. 

The  complex  structures  and  coupled  physical-electrical-chemical 
processes  in  CLs  pose  a  great  challenge  for  numerical  studies.  The 
pore-scale  studies  play  important  roles  in  exploring  the  microscopic 
transport processes in CL and coupling mechanisms between transport 
processes and the complex nanoscale structures. The pore-scale studies 
of  transport  processes  in  CL  can  be  traced  back  to  2006  [339–341]. 
Wang et al. [339] reconstructed a regular microstructures of CL, with 
only two components, one being the void space and the other a mixture 
of electrolyte, carbon and Pt. Reactive transport processes in the ideal-
ized CL were numerically studied by the FVM under different porosity, 
current  density  and  CL  thickness.  The  above  pore-scale  model  was 
further  extended  to  a  3D  random  structures  of  CL  [340].  Since  then, 
great efforts have been devoted to more precisely describing the porous 
structures  of  the  CLs,  to  predicting  the  related  effective  transport 
properties of CLs, and to taking into account more comprehensively the 
pore-scale multiple reactive transport processes inside the CLs. 

6.2.1. Prediction of effective transport properties 

Proper characterization of the nanoscale structures and constituent 
distributions of CLs is a prerequisite for the pore-scale modeling. The 
two-component structure adopted in Refs. [339–341] simplifies the CL 
structure complexity. Several stochastic techniques have been proposed 
to  reconstruct  CL  structures  with  more  details.  Hattori  et  al.  [342] 
employed a number of solid spheres with radius obeying the size dis-
tribution  of  carbon  particles.  Discrete  Pt  particles  were  added  on  the 
surface of carbon spheres, and thin ionomer film was then covered on 
the Pt/C surface [342]. Following the above technique, Kim and Pitch

[336] reconstructed similar sphere-based structures, where a simulated 
annealing method was further adopted to obtain desired porosity and 
two-point  correction  function.  The  LBM  was  adopted  to  simulate  gas 
diffusion and proton conduction, and effective diffusivity and tortuosity 
[336]. Lange et al. [206] reconstructed similar CL structures including 
carbon,  ionomer  and  pore.  The  mechanism  of  Knudsen  diffusion  was 
considered in their pore-scale studies. Effective diffusivity and conduc-
tivity were predicted based on the pore-scale results [206,209]. Wu and 
Jiang [326] further considered the particle size distribution of carbon 
black,  and  the  LBM  was  adopted  to  predict  effective  thermal/electric 
conductivity and effective diffusivity. Siddique and Liu [337] proposed a 
process-based reconstruction method that attempted to mimic the spe-
cific  synthesis  process  for  fabricating  CL.  Inoue  et  al.  [343]  recon-
structed  the  CL  structures  based  on  carbon  sphere  aggregates.  It  was 
found that local large pores inside the CL greatly reduce the effective 
diffusivity. Chen et al. [70] studied oxygen diffusion, proton conduction 
and  electrochemical  reactions  in  CLs  with  precious  and  non-precious 
catalysts.  It  was  found  that  mesoscale  pores  can  enhance  the  mass 
transport  and  improve  cell  performance.  Recently,  Chen  et  al.  [344] 
further studied effects of macroscopic pores and their distributions on 
reactive  transport  in  hierarchical  CL  structures.  An  optimized  porous 
structure was proposed with pore gradient and hierarchical pore size, 
with which the cell performance can be improved while the Pt loading is 
reduced. 

Very  recent  trend  of  CL  structure  reconstruction  is  by  combining 
experimental data from advanced techniques and stochastic techniques 
[50,53,345,346].  Cetinbas  et  al.  [53,346]  proposed  a  hybrid  recon-
struction scheme by combining nano-scale resolution X-ray for obtain-
ing structures of carbon black agglomerates, TEM for gaining Pt particle 
distributions, and a stochastic technique for generating ionomer film on 
the surface of Pt/C. Pore-scale simulations then were conducted inside 
the  reconstructed  CL  with  high  resolution,  and  effective  transport 
properties were predicted. 

6.2.2. Liquid water dynamics and distributions 

Currently, the pore-scale study of liquid water in CL is rare in the 
literature.  By  artificially  adding  a  liquid  water  film  on  the  3D  recon-
structed  structures  of  Pt/C,  the  effective  diffusivity  of  oxygen  under 
different water film thickness was predicted based on 2D slices of the 
reconstructed structures [347]. Fathi et al. [348] performed pore-scale 
study of liquid water distributions in CL and their effects on effective 
diffusivity and electrochemical reaction rate. It was found that for the 
same liquid water saturation, effective diffusivity of a hydrophobic CL is 
lower than that of a hydrophilic CL, because large pores in hydrophobic 
CL are filled by liquid water. Zheng and Kim [349] simulated pore-scale 
distributions of  liquid water  with different saturation in  CL. Effective 
diffusivity was predicted and the exponent was found to be around 3. 

For  the  coupling  between  multiphase  flow  and  oxygen  reactive 
transport inside the CLs, recently Chen et al. [350] proposed a pore-scale 
model using the LBM for the above processes. Effects of wettability on 
the water generation and migration as well as electrochemical reaction 
were discussed in detail. Zheng et al. [351] proposed a pore-scale model 

which comprehensively considers the transport processes and electro-
chemical  reaction  inside  CLs  including  reactant  gas  transport,  proton 
and electron conduction, heat transfer, and two-phase flow. Time evo-
lutions  of  the  liquid  water  distribution  inside  the  CLs  were  well 
captured, as shown in Fig. 19. 

6.2.3. Low Pt loading transport resistance 

Currently,  reducing  the  Pt  loading  is  one  of  the  urgent  tasks  for 
promoting the application of PEMFC. However, an unexpected finding is 
that  when  Pt  loading  is  reduced,  a  previously  unaccounted  transport 
resistance becomes significant, which reduces the cell voltage, offsetting 
the cost saving from reducing Pt catalyst. Several mechanisms have been 
proposed to explain the additional transport resistance: oxygen perme-
ability inside the thin film may be significantly lower than that in the 
bulk ionomer; an interfacial dissolution resistance may exist at the pore- 
ionomer interface due to limited dissolution rate of the oxygen; and an 
interfacial resistance may exist at the ionomer/Pt interface [352–360]. 
Pore-scale  modeling  is  a  useful  tool  for  understanding  above  local 
transport processes in multiple constituents near the reactive sites. Very 
recently, there have been a few pore-scale modeling devoted to studying 
the reactive transport processes in CL with low Pt loading. Cetinbas et al. 
[361] proposed a 2D CL model in which the disperse distributions of Pt 
particles are resolved. High transport resistance (or low limiting current 
density) under low Pt loading was successfully captured. Chen et al. [78, 
335,362]  proposed  a  3D  pore-scale  model  for  reactive  transport  pro-
cesses in CL (Fig. 20), where local transport processes are considered 
including concentration drop and interfacial dissolution reaction with 
limited rate at the pore-ionomer interface, oxygen diffusion inside the 
thin  ionomer  film,  and  electrochemical  reaction  at  the  ionomer-Pt 
interface.  Simulation  results  show  that  by  considering  the  interfacial 
dissolution  resistance,  the  predicted  local  transport  resistance  agrees 
with experimental results in the literature. Effects of Pt particle distri-
butions, Pt agglomeration and ionomer thickness on the local transport 
resistance were explored in detail. Recently, effects of relative humidity 
(RH) on the local transport resistance were also studied in Ref. [363]. 
The relationship between RH and the pores to be filled with liquid water 
was  adopted,  and  effects  of  RH  on  the  oxygen  diffusivity  inside  the 
ionomer were considered. The pore-scale results show complicated ef-
fects of the RH on the local transport resistance (See Fig. 21). 

6.3. Challenges 

From above discussion, it is clear that multiphase flow with phase 
change, heat transfer, mass transport, electrochemical reaction simul-
taneously take place inside the porous electrodes of PEMFC. Currently, 
there  have  been  no  pore-scale  models  which  can  comprehensively 
consider  all  these  processes.  First,  while  many  pore-scale  simulations 
have been conducted to study air-liquid two phase flow under different 
conditions, there still lacks pore-scale studies which considers coupled 
multiphase flow and heat transfer processes. The corresponding pore- 
scale  models  still  need  further  development.  Such  pore-scale  models 
will  be  greatly  helpful  for  understanding  complicated  phase  change

ion, and water vapor and electron are released. In the cathode, oxygen is 
reduced and oxide ion is formed [368]. 

Second,  developing  pore-scale  model  that  can  fully  consider  the 
multiphase  reactive  transport  processes  inside  CLs  is  a  difficult  task. 
Pore-scale  studies  are  urgently  required  to  reveal  the  mechanisms  of 
local transport resistance, to explore the interactions between nanoscale 
structures and the reactive transport processes, to investigate the water 
dynamic  behaviors,  and  to  understand  the  coupling  mechanisms  be-
tween structure evolutions caused by degradation and reactive transport 
processes [338,351]. It is worth mentioning that pores with typical pore 
size of a few nanometers are quite common inside the CLs. Pore-scale 
models should be able to account for the nanoscale effects of reactive 
transport processes, such as slip, surface diffusion, surface adsorption 
and desorption, etc. [43,364]. 

Finally, the porous electrodes of PEMFC are intrinsically multiscale. 
Pore sizes vary from a few nanometers in CLs, to hundreds of nanome-
ters in MPL, and to tens of micrometers in GDL. The reactive transport 
processes across the interface between CL, MPL and GDL are far from 
well understood [365]. Zhang et al. [366] developed a pore-scale model 
for  coupled  multiphase  flow  and  reactive  transport  with  both  micro-
scopic structures of GDL and MPL resolved. Indeed, pore-scale modeling 
accounting for the transport processes across the multiscale electrodes 
requires  considerable  or  even  unaffordable  resources.  Pore-scale 
modeling that can reduce computational resources and accelerate the 
modeling are highly desirable. 

7. Application in the solid oxide fuel cell 

The SOFC is attracting attention because of its promising conversion 
efficiency  [367],  flexibility  in  fuel  choice  [368],  and  low  pollutions. 
SOFC has a structure with a solid ceramic electrolyte sandwiched by an 
anode and a cathode [368]. In the anode, hydrogen gas reacts with oxide 

7.1. Electrochemical models for electrodes 

7.1.1. Transport models 

The  pore-scale  models  are  often  applied  to  simulate  the  electro-
chemical processes inside the SOFC electrodes. The governing equations 
for the gas, ion and electron transport in the porous electrode can be 
described by the general form of Eq. (1) without convective term and the 
source  term  is  associated  with  the  electrochemical  reaction.  The  gas 
diffuses inside the pores of the SOFC electrodes with relatively low ve-
locity, and the Knudsen number of the gas diffusion in the SOFC elec-
trode is in the range of 0.1 to 5.0, which corresponds to the transitional 
flow  regime  where  molecular, viscous  and  Knudsen  diffusion  all take 
place. 

The Fick’s model (FM) is widely adopted to solve the mass diffusion 
inside the SOFC electrode [369] for its inherent simplicity and its ability 
to  solve  the  Knudsen  flows  as  the  Knudsen  diffusion  coefficient  is 
included. However, the FM is not valid to simulate the system where 
molecular interactions cannot be neglected [370]. In order to account 
for the multi-component system, the Stefan-Maxwell model is used, in 
which  binary  diffusion  coefficient  is  considered  [371].  The  dusty  gas 
model (DGM) [372] is another popular model for SOFC modeling which 
takes into account the multi-component interactions and the Knudsen 
diffusion. It is assumed in DGM that pore walls are composed of giant 
dust  molecules,  which  are  considered  to  be  a  pseudo  species  in  the 
mixture. The DGM has a form of:

where N represents the rate of mass transport, x is the molar fraction, 
and  B0  is  the permeability. In many SOFC electrode  simulations with 
DGM,  the  gas  diffusion  model  can  be  simplified  by  neglecting  the 
gradient  of  total  pressure  [373,374].  However,  DGM  suffers  from  its 
physical  ambiguity  and  algebraic  complexity.  Young  and  Todd  [375] 
developed the cylindrical pore interpolation model (CPIM), in which the 
derivation  of  the  governing  equations  was  unambiguous  with  minor 

reference electrode which is virtually set close to TPB. 

Fig. 22 shows the schematic of the total electrode overpotential. The 
total electrode overpotential is obtained by subtracting the ohmic drops 
of the current collector (CC), electrolyte, and reference electrode from 
the  potential  difference  between  reference  electrode  and  current  col-
lector.  The  following  equation  can  be  obtained  by  assuming  that  the 
ohmic drop is zero for the reference electrode [374,382]:

where c is the mixture molar density, m is the molecular mass, A and DA 
are  the  coefficient  of  the  pressure  gradient  and  the  flow  coefficient, 
which  are  introduced  in  Ref.  [375].  Direct  simulation  Monte  Carlo 
(DSMC) adopted probabilistic simulation to solve the Boltzmann equa-
tion for gas flows. Lu et al. [377] conducted DSMC simulation to model 
the  gas  concentration  distributions  inside  the  porous  SOFC  electrode, 
and good agreement with the experiment measurement was obtained. 

7.1.2. Electrochemical reaction 

The electrochemical reaction takes place inside the SOFC electrode, 
and  electrical  power  is  generated.  The  reactants  at  TPB  or  DPB  must 
overcome an energy barrier named activation energy, which results in 
the activation polarization [368]. The Butler-Volmer equation is widely 
adopted  to  solve  the  activation  polarization  [373,378].  It  should  be 
noted  that  many  works  define  activation  overpotential  and  electrode 
potential  with  electrostatic  potential  [379–381].  However,  since  the 
ionic conductivity values applied during the pore-scale simulation are 
often  defined  for  electrochemical  potential,  overpotential  should  be 
written as a function of electrochemical potentials. Fig. 22(a) shows the 
schematics of the definitions of local overpotentials at TPB [373,382, 
383]. ηact  represents the local activation overpotential. Therefore, ηact 
are  defined  by  subtracting  local  ohmic  losses  from  the  local  over-
potential ηlocal as [382]:

7.2. Electrode microstructure modeling 

7.2.1. Prediction of electrochemical characteristics 

The  continuum-scale  model  assumes  uniform  distributions  of  the 
solid and pore phases with an REV, and continuous averaged quantities 
are  used  to  represent  the  electrochemical  characteristics such  as  con-
ductivities, diffusivities and TPB densities [384,385]. In addition, for the 
transport process, the continuum models require accurate estimations of 
the  effective  conductivities  and  diffusivities,  which  are  related  to  the 
structural parameters such as tortuosity and volume fraction. However, 
these parameters are often obtained indirectly either from the 2D SEM 
and  TEM  images,  or  from  empirical  correlations  with  other  measure-
ment results [371,386-388]. Although these methodologies simplify the 
computation  of  the  required  parameters,  the  detailed  3D 
in-
terconnections of the different phases are ignored [389,390], leading to 
large uncertainty in the continuum-scale model. 

The  advancements  in  the  3D  reconstruction  techniques  made  it 
possible  to  directly  handle  SOFC  electrode  porous  microstructures. 
Wilson et al. [389] was the pioneer to apply FIB-SEM to SOFC research. 
Many following works can be found in the literature [374,391]. Espe-
cially  high  resolutions  can  be  achieved  by  the  orthogonally  aligned 
FIB-SEM  which  has  a  resolution  as  fine  as  several  nanometers  [376]. 
Compared  with  the  FIB-SEM,  nano-XCT  is  a  non-destructive  imaging 
technique. Izzo et al. [392] used nano-XCT to reconstruct Ni-yttria sta-
bilized  zirconia  (Ni-YSZ)  anode.  Recently,  various  electrode  micro-
structures were reconstructed with the nano-XCT [393]. What is more, 
Zhang  et  al.  [394]  proposed  a  methodology  to  reconstruct  3D micro-
structure of the SOFC electrodes from 2D high-resolution images based 
on  multi-stage  recovering  procedure  of  distance  correlation  functions 
(DCF), which provided an economic approach to obtain the 3D electrode 
microstructure. 

Electrochemical parameters such as the TPB density, tortuosity fac-
tor and effective conductivities have drawn much attention because they 
represent the transport and reaction processes of the SOFC operation. 
The  first  attempt  to  compute  these  parameters  from  the  3D  micro-
structure is Wilson et al. [389]. In their study, the ratio of the TPB sites 
which  have  a  contiguous  connection  to  the  rest  of  the  structure  was 
computed, and the tortuosity factors of the pore phase were obtained by 
solving  the  transport  equation.  Iwai  et  al.  [13]  introduced  various 
methodologies  to  obtain  the  TPB  length,  tortuosity,  effective  conduc-
tivity and diffusivity from a 3D dataset. Volume expansion method and 
the centroid method were proposed to compute the TPB length, and the 

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience88(2022)10096826L. Chen et al.

step-like pattern of voxel edges could be avoided with these methods. 
Random walk method and the LBM were used to compute the tortuosity 
factor  and  effective  conductivity  and  diffusivity.  The  methodologies 
introduced  by  Iwai  et  al.  [13]  were  widely  adopted  to  analyze  the 
electrode  characteristics.  For  instance,  Brus  et  al.  [395]  obtained  the 
tortuosity factor using the random walk method based on a 3D micro-
structure obtained from the FIB-SEM technique; and then, the tortuosity 
factor was compared with that calculated according to the  saturation 
current density obtained experimentally. In addition, resistor network 
model which considers the porous structure as a resistor network is also 
an efficient pore-scale methodology to obtain the effective conductiv-
ities. Schneider et al. [396] adopted the resistor network to compute the 
effective  conductivity  of  an  electrode  microstructure  obtained  by  the 
discrete  element  method  (DEM).  Rhazaoui  et  al.  [397,398]  used  the 
resistor network model to compute the effective conductivities, and the 
model is validated by the measured results. 

It  is  mentioned  that  SOFC  operation  is  a  complicated  process 
involving  transport,  diffusion,  and  reaction.  Therefore,  the  electro-
chemical  characteristics  of  the  SOFC  electrode  cannot  be  fully  repre-
sented by these independent structural parameters, the combination of 
different electrochemical processes should be considered for the pore- 
scale  models.  Grew  et  al.  [399]  applied  the  LBM  to  simulate  the  gas 
transport  and  reaction  processes  during  the  SOFC  anode  operation. 
During the simulation, five types of gas species and the detailed reaction 
processes such as the gas species adsorption are considered, which were 
implemented as discretized boundary conditions within the LBM model. 
Shikazono et al. [373] introduced a sophisticated 3D LBM model which 
involved major electrochemical processes for the Ni-YSZ anode opera-
tion: electronic and ionic conduction, gas diffusion and electrochemical 
reaction. The gas transport was solved with the DGM method, and the 
TPB  length  was  obtained  from  the  centroid  method.  Following  this 
computational  algorithm,  computational  models  for  various  types  of 
electrodes with various properties have been developed. For instance, 
Matsuzaki  et  al.  [374]  proposed  a  simulation  model  to  predict  the 
electrochemical  properties  of  the  La0.58Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3(cid:0) δ  (LSCF) 
cathode.  Recently,  it  was  found  that detailed kinetics  such as  surface 
reactions also play important role during operation. Lynch et al. [400] 
utilized COMSOL and iso2mesh packages to simulate the bulk and sur-
face pathways of the oxygen reduction reaction in the SOFC cathode, so 
that  the  surface  and  bulk  kinetics  during  operation  could  both  be 
considered. The improvement of computational accuracy and efficiency 
for the pore-scale simulation also attracted much attention. Kishimoto 
et  al.  [401]  proposed  a  sub-grid  scale  model  to  predict  the  electro-
chemical  performance  of  the  Ni-YSZ  anode,  in  which  each  computa-
tional  grid  possesses  a  scalar  local  conductivity  approximated  by  the 
Bruggeman model. It was demonstrated that the proposed model was 

able  to  improve  the  computational  efficiency  without  sacrificing  the 
accuracy. 

Furthermore, since the pore-scale model is capable of predicting the 
electrochemical performances, it is adopted to investigate the reaction 
and  degradation  mechanisms,  and  to  determine  the  optimal  micro-
structures, etc. Vivet et al. [402] obtained the structural parameters such 
as active TPB densities and tortuosity factors of the Ni-YSZ anodes with 
different  compositions  according  to  the  3D  structures,  and  concluded 
that the Ni-YSZ anode with 40:60 vol.% is the optimal composition with 
high conductivity and the largest active TPB density value. Kim et al. 
[391]  fabricated  LSCF-Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95  (GDC)  cathodes  with  various 
compositions  and  the  ionic  transport  is  solved  using  the  pore-scale 
model.  As  shown  in  Fig.  23,  the  local  distribution  of  the  oxide  ion 
electrochemical potential and the current vectors was obtained [391]. It 
is  revealed  that  the  experimental  results  cannot  be  well  reproduced 
without considering LSCF-GDC-pore TPB reaction in a LSCF-GDC sys-
tem.  According  to  experimental  and  numerical  investigations,  the 
LSCF-GDC  composite  cathode  with  30:70  vol.%  showed  the  lowest 
overpotential under the same current density value. Shimura et al. [403] 
conducted pore-scale simulation using the 3D LSCF microstructure with 
different operation times. A decrease in the surface exchange rate during 
operation is assumed, and low ionic conductivities were applied for the 
inter-diffusion phase caused by degradation. It is found that these pro-
posed degradation mechanisms were able to reproduce the degradation 
factor  obtained  from  the  experiment  fairly  well.  Prokop  et  al.  [404] 
proposed  a  pore-scale  model  to  investigate  the  SOFC  electrochemical 
characteristics. It was found that the SOFC performance was improved 
even after long-term operation, which was attributed to the reduction of 
the anode pore-phase tortuosity. He et al. [405] optimized the porous 
LSCF  cathode  microstructure  of  the  SOFC.  The  level-set  method  was 
adopted  to  parametrize  the  porous  structure,  and  the  adjoint  method 
was applied for sensitivity analysis during the optimization. As shown in 
Fig.  24,  during  the  optimization,  the  LSCF  cathode  structures  were 
deformed so that the total amount of reaction current was maximized. 

7.2.2. Prediction of structure deformation 

In  order  to  obtain  the  densified  electrolyte  and  electrode  micro-
structure of the SOFC, the corresponding material must undergo several 
high-temperature firing steps, which is named as sintering process and is 
closely related with the cell performance [406]. Models such as kinetic 
Monte Carlo (KMC), MD and discrete element method (DEM) are able to 
simulate the sintering process. KMC is attractive for its ability to handle 
relatively  large  computational  volume  and  ease  of  coding  [407,408]. 
Hara et al. [408] applied KMC to simulate the sintering process of the Ni 
phase,  and  the  geometric  parameters  of  the  simulation  results  were 
validated with the structure obtained by FIB-SEM. Yan et al. [407] also

utilized KMC to simulate the sintering process, in which artificial neural 
network (ANN) was trained to calibrate the input parameters of KMC 
such  as  the  attempt  frequencies  and  simulation  temperatures.  MD 
method is also widely adopted to simulate the sintering process because 
of its robust physical standpoint. Xu et al. [409] utilized MD to simulate 
the sintering process of Ni-YSZ anode, and the simulation implied that 
the YSZ phase closed to the Ni nanoparticles prevented Ni phase from 
agglomeration.  However,  MD  requires  heavy  computational  load,  so 
that  only  an  extremely  short  physical  time  evolution  with  several 
nanometer size can be simulated [409]. DEM enforces the force equi-
librium for each particle in the packing during sintering. Liu et al. [410] 
modeled  the  sintering  process  of  electrode  microstructures  such  as 
LSM/YSZ and NiO/YSZ. In addition, since discrete element formalism is 
able to consider the particle arrangement, the reduction process of the 
NiO phase was conducted by applying the discrete element formulation. 
The agglomeration of the solid particles of the electrodes is one of the 
major  causes  of  degradation  during  the  SOFC  operation.  Phase  field 

model is attractive to simulate the coarsening and agglomeration of the 
materials, because it can implicitly handle the movements of interfaces 
using order parameters [409]. Chen et al. [411] proposed two models to 
simulate the Ni coarsening processes with phase field method; one is to 
consider Ni-YSZ-pore anode as a system of three mobile phases, while 
the other is to assume YSZ as the stationary phase while the Ni and pore 
as the mobile phases. Jiao et al. [412] applied Fourier spectral method in 
the phase field modeling to enhance computational efficiency. KMC has 
also been applied to investigate the agglomeration of SOFC electrodes 
during  operation.  Zhang  et  al.  [413]  utilized  KMC  to  simulate  the 
generic thermal aging kinetics of the infiltrate electrode microstructure. 
It is expected that these models which can handle temporal changes in 
microstructures will greatly contribute to the development of efficient 
electrodes with long time durability.

7.3. Challenges 

In the field of SOFC, the pore-scale models play critical role to predict 
the electrochemical characteristics, to find the optimal microstructures, 
and  to  investigate  the  degradation  mechanisms  of  the  electrodes. 
However, the pore-scale models applied to the SOFC field face several 
challenges. In order to obtain precise prediction of the electrochemical 
performance,  the  method  capable  of  reconstructing  high  resolution 
structures is required. The current FIB-SEM technique is able to obtain 
the  3D  structure  with  a  resolution  of  several  nanometers;  however, 
because of the increasing requirement of computational accuracy, the 
resolution of the state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction is still not sufficient. 
In  addition,  during  the  SOFC  operation,  the  electrochemical  reaction 
often  involves  multiple  electrochemical  steps:  adsorption  of  the  gas 
species,  transport  of  the  gas  atoms  through  the  electrode  surface, 
transport of the oxide ions, and electrochemical reaction at the TPB or 
DPB sites [414]. For the current pore-scale models, in order to relieve 
the computational load, a limited number of processes are solved, with 
other processes being ignored. Thus, more advanced numerical models 
which  can  handle  multiple  electrochemical  processes  are  required  in 
order  to  further  improve  the  computational  accuracy.  Furthermore, 
recently, it is reported that the degradation of the electrode is highly 
related to the migration of the different phases during operation [415]. 
Although the pore-scale method such as the phase field method has been 
applied to simulate this phenomenon, few numerical models are capable 
of  providing  accurate  prediction  which  can  match  the  experimental 
observation. 

8. Challenges and prospects 

While  the  pore-scale  modeling  is  playing  increasingly  important 
roles in understanding transport processes in porous media, we would 
like  to  provide  our  perspectives  on  several  aspects  of  the  pore-scale 
modeling. 

1) In the literature, quite a lot of pore-scale modeling work is about 
predicting  the  macroscopic  transport  properties  required  in  the 
continuum-scale models. The REV should be achieved when the pore- 
scale modeling is employed for this purpose. On the one hand, under 
some  situations  there  is  a  large-scale  gap  between  pore-scale  and 
continuum-scale models. How to incorporate the pore-scale simulation 
results  in  a  specific  porous  sample  to  large-scale  continuum-scale 
simulation  is  challenging  and  requires  appropriate  upscaling  method 
[416]. On the other hand, for some porous media, the REV actually does 
not exist, such as the thin porous media whose thickness is comparable 
to its typical pore size [332]. Under such scenario, one should be pru-
dent when incorporating the predicted macroscopic transport properties 
into the continuum-scale models based on the REV. 

However, the pore-scale modeling cannot be considered as merely a 
method for improving the continuum-scale models. The more important 
roles are to provide underlying mechanisms of different transport pro-
cesses, to reveal the interactions between the porous structures and the 
pore-scale transport processes, and to provide guidance for the optimal 
design of the nano/microscale structures of porous media. Particularly, 
with the advent of next-generation techniques for nano/micro fabrica-
tion,  it  is  becoming  possible  to  fabricate  porous  media  with  desired 
nano/microscopic  structures  and  constituent  distributions.  The  pore- 
scale  modeling  is  the  natural  choice  to  answer  the  question  on  what 
porous structures and constituent distributions are better for improving 
performance  [417],  and  thus  is  expected  to  have  an  unprecedented 
impact on the next-generation porous media. 

2)  Accurate  pore-scale  modeling  requires  the  efficient  3D  recon-
struction technique.  For  the reconstruction,  one major  obstacle is the 
low  resolution  of  the  3D  microstructure.  The  current  visualization 
techniques for FIB-SEM is able to obtain the 3D structure with a reso-
lution  of  2  nm  [376],  however,  because  of  the  presence  of  the  small 
reactive nano-particles in multiple fields such as the CL of the PEMFC, 

the resolution of the state-of-the-art 3D reconstructed microstructure is 
still not sufficient. Applying the deep learning to enhance the resolution 
of the 3D microstructure is one possible solution [418]. In the past few 
years, several studies have started to improve the resolution of the 3D 
structures  through  neural  networks  [419,420].  Unfortunately,  this 
methodology has not yet been applied to the microstructure geometries. 
Therefore,  research  remains  to  be  done  to  apply  the  neural  network 
techniques to enhance the resolution of the 3D porous microstructures. 
Developing  new  techniques  able  to  obtain  the  3D  structure  with 
sub-nanometer resolution is another solution. Recently new techniques 
such as the atom probe tomography have been developed [421], and the 
sub-nanometer  3D  reconstruction  is  enabled  with  these  techniques. 
However, these techniques are currently limited to a few applications 
and need to be extended to other areas. 

3) Since the porous structures are resolved, the pore-scale modeling 
usually requires very large numerical grids; moreover, the number of 
grid  points  would  dramatically  increase  if  the  resolution  is  further 
enhanced to include more details of the geometries. Thus, relieving the 
computational  load  without  sacrificing  the  computational  accuracy  is 
highly required for the current simulations. Different schemes have been 
proposed to save the computational resources of pore-scale modeling. 
For  example,  standard  LB  pore-scale  modeling  requires  the  particle 
distribution functions to be stored in both fluid and solid phase. How-
ever,  this  causes  a  computation  resource  waste  if  only  transport  pro-
cesses inside the pores are of concern. A scheme that stores a single set of 
PDFs for pore cells only was proposed, which is very beneficial for low- 
porosity  porous  media  [422].  Besides,  a  multiscale-decomposition 
scheme was developed to accelerate the pore-scale modeling [423]. In 
such  scheme,  a  physical  variable  is  decomposed  into  the  volume 
average, which represents global variations with longwave lengths, and 
the deviation from the average, which represents local fluctuations. The 
volume average is firstly solved using tridiagonal method such as the 
tridiagonal  matrix  algorithm  (TDMA),  and  the  pore-scale  modeling  is 
then  performed  using  the  volume average.  Such  scheme  can  substan-
tially  reduce  the  computational  cost  without  sacrificing  accuracy.  In 
addition, machine learning methods also have been combined with the 
pore-scale modeling for accelerating the prediction of transport prop-
erties  of  porous  media  [424,425].  In  such  scheme,  the  pore-scale 
modeling is first conducted to provide a database to train the machine 
learning models such as the support vector regression (SVR), Gaussian 
process regression (GPR) and convolution neural network (CNN). Then 
these trained models are adopted for fast prediction of transport prop-
erties. What is more, multi-scale modeling scheme by coupling different 
methods  in  different  sub-regions  is  also  proposed,  which  can  save 
computational resources while preserving the pore-scale details [426, 
427].  For  example,  for  a  domain  with  free  fluid  region  and  a  porous 
region, the FVM and LBM are used for these two regions, respectively, 
with  information  exchanged  at  the  interface  between  the  two 
sub-domains.  In  addition,  Kishimoto  et  al.  [401,428]  proposed  a  nu-
merical model to maintain the local geometric information inside the 
coarse  grid, and  the  computational  load was  largely  relieved  without 
sacrificing the computational accuracy. 

4) Currently, the pore-scale models and numerical schemes still need 
to be further improved. The main challenge is to include multiple pro-
cesses that are usually involved in the different porous components. For 
example, in the CL of PEMFC, the ORR reaction between oxygen, proton 
and electron generates water. Subsequently, complicated water gener-
ation, adsorption, evaporation/condensation, and migration processes 
take place in the nanoscale structures of CL. However, most of the pore- 
scale  modeling  currently  focus  on  isothermal  single-phase  reactive 
transport processes. Although very recent pore-scale modeling has made 
great progress in revealing the effects of pore-ionomer interfacial phe-
nomena and their effects on the cell performance under low Pt loading 
scenario  [78],  pore-scale  models  accounting  for  the  coupling  mecha-
nisms between mass transport, heat transfer, electrochemical reaction 
and the multiphase flow are highly required. Furthermore, in the CL the 

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience88(2022)10096829L. Chen et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    

porous structure evolutions caused by Pt agglomerate, Pt dissolution and 
carbon matrix collapse lead to degradation, and pore-scale models that 
consider the coupling between structure evolution and electrochemical 
processes are highly desired [338]. Another example is the SOFC. The 
operation of the SOFC electrode involves processes such as the surface 
absorption of gasses, chemical reactions, gas transports, and ion trans-
port. However, in the state-of-the-art pore-scale simulation, these pro-
cesses are lumped into one or two procedures, which largely decreases 
the computational accuracy. In the future studies, it is highly desirable 
to  explicitly  include  these  multiple  processes  in  the  pore-scale 
simulations. 

5) Combined with some optimization techniques such as topology 
optimization,  the  pore-scale  modeling  can  be  employed  to  guide  the 
design  of  porous  media.  Giving  a  set  of  defined  objectives  and  con-
straints,  an  optimized  design  with  better  performance  (e.g.,  transport 
properties) can be obtained by topology optimization which is based on 
the optimal theory in mathematics. During the optimization iteration, 
the transport processes inside the structure to be optimized are usually 
solved with pore-scale models, and the structure generated by topology 
optimization can be treated as porous medium since it usually consists of 
tortuous paths and complex interfaces. Recently, topology optimization 
for  transport  processes  based  on  pore-scale  modeling  is  drawing 
increasing attention, and has been increasingly adopted to optimize heat 
exchangers  and  porous  electrodes  [405,429-433]. However,  currently 
the  application  of  topology  optimization  is  mostly  focused  on  either 
single physical process or some simply coupled processes. Moreover, the 
physical processes in most of the optimization problems are simplified as 
two-dimensional  steady state process due to  the limitation of  compu-
tational resources (i.e. memory and CPU time). Therefore, in order to 
apply topology optimization to practical engineering design, it is highly 
desirable to develop optimization models based on pore-scale models for 
complex  coupled  transport  processes,  to  develop  optimization  algo-
rithms  suited  for  large  scale  parallel  computing,  and  thus  to  solve 
practical optimization problems of 3D unsteady processes. 

9. Conclusion 

Due to the limitations of current experimental techniques as well as 
the  continuum-scale  models,  the  pore-scale  modeling  plays  an  indis-
pensable role in gaining in-depth understanding of nano/micro/meso-
scopic  transport  processes  inside  the  porous  media.  The  pore-scale 
modeling is directly conducted on the pore structures of porous media, 
and thus has the powerful capacity of providing detailed distribution of 
important  variables  and  revealing  the  interaction  between  porous 
structures and the transport processes. The pore-scale modeling thus has 
been  increasingly  utilized,  especially  during  the  past  ten  years,  to 
investigate transport processes inside porous media. 

Recent  development  in  imaging  techniques  and  computational 
reconstruction has resulted in more accurate description of the realistic 
structures of porous media. Besides the general reconstruction methods 
developed in the literature, customized reconstruction schemes are more 
efficient and time saving for reconstructing porous structures. Inside the 
porous media, boundaries and interfaces between different constituents 
are  abundant,  and  the  main  challenge  for  pore-scale  modeling  is  to 
accurately simulate these boundaries and interfacial phenomena. In this 
respect, significant progresses have been made for different numerical 
methods, and the progresses in the framework of the LBM are discussed 
in  this review, including steady and  unsteady conjugate heat transfer 
with large ratio of thermal conductivity, interfacial mass transport with 
concentration and diffusivity drop, chemical reaction, and contact angle 
modeling. The pore-scale modeling has been extensively adopted in the 
literature  to  study  various  processes  (fluid  flow,  heat  transfer,  mass 
transport,  charge  transfer,  multiphase  flow,  etc.),  to  predict  related 
macroscopic  transport properties  (permeability, relative  permeability, 
effective diffusivity, effective thermal conductivity, tortuosity, etc.), and 
to  provide  important  relationships  (capillary  pressure-saturation, 

specific surface area-saturation, etc.). Pore-scale modeling also has been 
widely adopted in many practical applications, and in this review the 
pore-scale  modeling  of  coupled  physicochemical  processes  in  geo-
science,  PEMFC  and  SOFC  are  thoroughly  reviewed.  It  has  been 
demonstrated that the pore-scale modeling is of great help to understand 
the intrinsic mechanisms of the transport phenomena in porous media 
and effects of the porous structures on the transport processes. The pore- 
scale  modeling  also  facilitates  optimal  design  of  the  nano/microscale 
structures of porous media for improved performance and durability. It 
is  worth  mentioning  that  due  to  the  growing  body  of  literature  over 
diverse  disciplines,  pore-scale  modeling  of  some  important  transport 
processes is not covered in this review, such as particulate flow [434] 
and electroosmotic flow [435]. Interested readers can refer to related 
studies in the literature. 

From this review, it can be concluded that the pore-scale simulations 
play several important roles as follows: 1) they can provide details of 
underlying physical,  chemical, electrical  and biological  processes and 
greatly  help  understand  the  pore-scale  transport  phenomena  and  the 
complex interactions between different processes, which are challenging 
for  the  state-of-the-art  experimental  techniques  to  obtain.  Thus,  the 
pore-scale models can provide insight into the intrinsic characteristics of 
why  macroscopic  parameters  behave  in  a  certain  way.  2)  They  can 
reveal  the  effects  of  the  microscopic  structures  and  the  interfacial 
properties of different constituents on the reactive transport processes, 
which  are  of  great  significance  especially  when  examining  effects  of 
heterogeneity,  such  as  mixed-wettability,  local  defects,  hierarchical 
porous  structures,  etc.  3)  By  adopting  upscaling  schemes,  the  macro-
scopic  effective  transport  properties  required  in  the  continuum-scale 
models can be obtained based on the pore-scale simulation results. 4) 
Based on the understanding of interplay between realistic structures and 
pore-scale  reactive  transport  processes,  the  porous  structures  and  the 
surface  properties  can  be  modified  to  enhance,  weaken,  control,  or 
regulate the corresponding transport processes, and thus to improve the 
performance of the porous media. 

In  conclusion,  complicated  structures  and  complex  multiple  pro-
cesses create chaos inside the porous media. Pore-scale modeling is a 
powerful tool to extract orders out of the chaos. It can help design porous 
media with better performance, and its combination with nano/micro-
scale  fabrication  techniques  (such  as  3D  printing  technology,  soft- 
templating  method,  hard-templating  method,  etc.  [436–438].)  will 
lead to the next-generation porous media.
