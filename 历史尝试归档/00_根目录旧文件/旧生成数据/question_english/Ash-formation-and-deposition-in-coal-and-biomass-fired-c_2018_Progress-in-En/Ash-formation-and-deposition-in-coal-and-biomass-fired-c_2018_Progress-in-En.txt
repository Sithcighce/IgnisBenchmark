The purpose of this paper is to review the present knowledge on ash formation, ash particle transport and
deposition during solid fuel combustion, with emphasis on particle sticking and rebound behavior. A sub-
stantial part of the fuel can be inorganic, forming inorganic vapors and ash particles. The impaction of solid,
molten or partially molten particles on surfaces is dependent on the particle and surface characteristics. For
instance, a particulate deposit might capture incoming particles or be removed due to erosion, while a mol-
ten layer will collect all impacting particles, no matter if they are sticky or not. The main properties affecting
the particle stickiness are the viscosity and surface tension for silicate-rich ashes. On the contrary, the
stickiness of salt-rich ashes (cid:1) typical for herbaceous biomass and wood- or waste-based fuels (cid:1) is often
described using the liquid melt fraction. Furthermore, the particle kinetic energy and the angle of impaction,
are crucial parameters. If all kinetic energy is dissipated during the impact, the particle will remain on the
surface. This review presents an overview of major ash forming elements found in biomass and coal, and
discusses the heterogeneity of particles’ inorganic composition. Ash transport and deposition mechanisms
as well as their mathematical description are given and discussed, together with composition- and temper-
ature-depended models for the estimation of ash particle and deposit properties. These properties are
essential in order to describe the particle sticking and rebound behavior.
Ash particle sticking and rebound criteria can be divided into three main groups, based on either: (1) the
particle melt fraction, (2) the particle viscosity, or (3) the energy dissipation of a particle, upon impaction.
Sticking criteria are presented, their required parameters are discussed and typical particle and surface
properties found in combustion systems, are summarized. Eight different sticking criteria are implemented
in a computational fluid dynamics code and computations are compared against measurements from an
entrained flow reactor. Uniform sized soda-lime glass particles are applied instead of inhomogeneous fly
ash particles, since soda-lime glass is known to behave similar to coal fly ash. Best agreement for the deposi-
tion rates on a clean tube is achieved using a criterion based on the work of Srinivasachar et al. [1]. In this
model, the sticking and rebound threshold, is a function of the particle kinetic energy, the angle of impac-
tion, and, the particle viscosity. Particularly, the particle viscosity is confirmed as a key parameter for sili-
cate-rich ashes. It should be calculated using temperature- and composition-dependent correlations, being
aware that there is a significant scattering in the results from such models and that the models are often
only valid in narrow compositional ranges, and cannot be used outside these. A mechanistic model is used
to explain results from glass particle experiments and their dependence on the particle kinetic energy.
Therefore, the impaction process is subdivided in four steps, and the energy dissipation of each step is calcu-
lated. These theoretical considerations show that the contact angle of a molten droplet with the substrate is
of minor importance, and that the majority of depositing particles are dominated by the work of deforma-
tion against viscosity, rather than surface tension effects.
This review underlines the importance of the particle viscosity, and its accurate prediction for silicate-rich
ashes. The proposed criterion is able to predict the sticking of small, solid particles below 10 mm diameter,
as it is often observed in literature. Also, it is crucial to consider the surface structure and stickiness, in order
to predict deposition rates in solid fuel-fired systems. Biomass ashes and their stickiness are more difficult,
due to a different ash particle chemistry, compared to coal ashes. Salt-rich particles and their stickiness are

controlled by the amount of liquid phase. Here, a link between the viscosity and amount of liquid phase is a
promising approach, and should be addressed in future work. Furthermore, the viscosity of different ash
particles (cid:1) silicate-, salt- or Ca-rich (cid:1) should preferentially be modeled from the chemical and physical
structure instead of an empirical fitting procedure between fuel chemistry and viscosity measurements.

1. Introduction

Ash deposition on heat exchanging surfaces during solid fuel
combustion, leads to a number of operational problems, and may
cause frequent power plant shutdowns, reduced heat transfer rates
or increased soot-blowing and cleaning activities [14(cid:1)16]. The main
route between a burning fuel particle in a furnace, and a

troublesome deposit on a heat transfer surface, can be divided into a
number of consecutive steps:

(cid:3) Release of critical ash-forming elements (mainly K, Na, S, Cl, Zn,
and Pb), during devolatilization, and subsequent char burnout,
(cid:3) Formation of aerosol particles by nucleation and coagulation of

flame-volatilized ash-forming elements,

(cid:3) Formation and entrainment of coarse fly ash particles through
transformation (chemically and physically) during

mineral
devolatilization and char burnout,

(cid:3) Transport of ash species, i.e. gases, liquids (droplets) and solids

(particles), from bulk gas to heat transfer surfaces,

(cid:3) Sticking, adhesion or rebound of these ash species on heat trans-

fer surfaces, and

(cid:3) Build-up, sintering and consolidation, erosion and shedding of

deposits.

Through several years, high-quality research has been conducted
to characterize fuels [2(cid:1)6], investigate fuel conversion and ash for-
mation [7(cid:1)11], as well as ashes and deposit formation in utility boil-
ers fired with coal, biomass and waste fractions [12(cid:1)20]. Huge
amounts of experimental data have been gained, but the fact is that
there are still in 2017, a number of big gaps in our current under-
standing of ash and deposit formation in utility boilers, and that we
need to focus strongly on these points, in order to be able to
describe, understand and quantify the process of deposit formation
completely. Many high-quality data are available on the release of
critical ash-forming elements, although most of the lab-scale meas-
urements are performed under experimental conditions different
from what happens in full-scale. The main difference being the parti-
cle size distribution of the fuels investigated, and the time-tempera-
ture history, mainly the heat-up rate and final
temperature,
experienced by the fuel particles. Further important differences
between small-scale setups and furnace environments are particle
concentrations affecting particle dynamics and particle formation by
condensation, as well as the fact that drop tube studies are often
conducted with high excess air and low gas velocities. Both, particle
concentration and excess air, are crucial explaining partial vaporiza-
tion, e.g. of alkali metals. Fly ash formation has been intensively
studied for coal combustion, where the fly ash size distribution has a

XSub-micron particles on the contrary,
originate mainly from homogeneous nucleation, and subsequent
coagulation of flame-volatilized inorganic species. Other important
processes going on include fragmentation of chars and mineral
inclusions as well as coalescence of ash droplets on receding char
surfaces. A number of basic mechanisms of ash species transport has
been outlined and quantified in the literature during the last
20 years, but a very crucial aspect of ash deposition, the process
when an ash particle impacts on a heat exchanging surface, is often
not addressed or discussed in detail. There is a lack of a comprehen-
sive review in the field of ash particle sticking and rebound behavior
and a comparison of different sticking criteria in terms of accuracy
and performance. In this field, many publications use inappropri-
ate models underlining the necessity of a review. Therefore, this
paper summarizes ash formation and deposition mechanisms,
discusses the differences between biomass and coal, and presents
a critical literature review on ash particle sticking and rebound
criteria.

This paper is organized in the following manner. Section 2 pro-
vides the fundamentals of solid fuel combustion systems, inorganic
constituents in solid fuels, ash formation, fly ash particles and their
classification, deposit formation mechanisms as well as an overview
on the effect of deposits on heat transfer. It is a summary of major

literature references, however, due to the enormous amount of stud-
ies in this wide field, it is not possible to include all findings. Section 3
gives mathematical models for the estimation of particle and deposit
properties. These properties are required in order to describe the ash
particle stickiness. The following two sections review experimental
and theoretical studies on ash particle sticking and rebound behav-
ior. Different sticking criteria found in literature are summarized
and discussed critically for their applicability. Section 6 evaluates
and compares different sticking criteria and explains main findings.
Section 7 presents a comprehensive model describing all relevant
processes during ash deposition in solid fuel-fired systems. Finally,
an outlook and recommendations for future work is given and con-
clusions are drawn.

2. Fireside deposit formation

Solid fuel combustion has been subject to research for more than
100 years. But still today there are many unresolved problems and
phenomena, which are not understood in detail. Many existing
mathematical models describing solid fuel conversion are empirical
in nature and fitted towards measurements. One of the main reasons
is the heterogeneity and complex chemical structure of solid fuels
and their changes during thermal conversion. Fuel conversion in
combustion systems involves homogeneous and heterogeneous
chemical reactions, changing particle structures entrained in a tur-
bulent flow combined with radiative heat transfer. The complex
interaction of these phenomena, is the main difficulty in under-
standing and modeling such systems.

2.1. Solid fuel combustion systems

Typical solid fuel combustion systems are illustrated and
compared in Fig. 1. They comprise of three main types: grate
combustion, fluidized bed (FB) combustion and pulverized fuel
(PF) combustion systems. Characteristics of each boiler type are
summarized underneath each schematic. The main difference
among boiler types are boiler size, fuel quality, fuel processing
before combustion, fuel-oxidizer ratio, gas flow conditions as
well as temperatures.

Pulverized fuel boilers are the most commonly built systems for
power generation from coal. Pulverized fuel, with a typical particle
size smaller than 200 mm, is transported with preheated air or recir-
culated flue gas to the burner and into the furnace. Particles heat up,
release combustible gases and react with oxygen, forming flue gas.
The flue gas is transported with the remaining ash particles through
the combustion chamber. Boiler walls and tubes inside the combus-
tion system act as heat exchanging surfaces, where heat is trans-
ferred from the flue gas to the water-steam cycle. PF systems are
designed in a way that combustion is completed before the flue gas
reaches the first convective heat exchanger in the form of tube
banks. This ensures lower temperatures of remaining fly ash par-
ticles, compared to burning particles, and thus a reduced threat of
molten, sticky ash particles adhering to heat exchanging surfaces.
There are studies indicating that char particles burn at temperatures
up to 300 K higher than the surrounding flue gas [24]. A critical
parameter, when designing the furnace and its height, is the ash
softening and ash melting temperature. The furnace exit gas temper-
ature should stay below the ash softening temperature. However,
this criterion can also fail. There are studies reporting up to 50% of
melt in the ash system at the ash softening temperature [25,26]. In
this case, there can be excessive deposit formation, even though the
furnace exit gas temperature is below the ash softening tempera-
ture. The main difficulty in boiler design is to achieve a high level of
burnout, while staying below the ash softening temperature. This is
challenging, since nowadays, fuel and load flexibility become more
and more important. Within combustion systems, ash deposition is

often defined as either slagging or fouling. Slagging occurs in the fur-
nace area, where heat exchanging surfaces are exposed directly to
flame radiation. A further definition states that particles or deposits
are molten, and thus in the liquid state. Fouling is referred to depos-
its, which are not directly exposed to flame radiation. Deposits in
this area are typically caused by solidified particles. Fouling layers
are loosely bound or partly sintered, and therefore usually more
easy to clean [15]. Fig. 1 shows areas threatened by slagging (filled
with gray color) and fouling (no color). In modern tower boiler con-
figurations, this area ends after the first superheater, when radiation
of the flame is shaded by earlier tube banks. In the conventional two
path boiler design, this area is in the cross-over path between the
first and the second duct. The transition between slagging and foul-
ing is smooth and the extent to which a certain fuel leads to slagging
or fouling is highly dependent on the form and chemical composi-
tion of the inorganic material within the fuel as well as the process
conditions inside the boiler.

Fluidized bed combustion systems can be characterized as either
bubbling fluidized bed (BFB) or circulating fluidized bed (CFB) com-
bustion systems. The basic idea is to burn the fuel in a hot bed of
small particles, e.g. quartz sand, which are fluidized using combus-
tion air from below. The bed material is typically kept at relatively
low temperatures (800(cid:1)900 °C) in order to reduce pollutant forma-
tion, particle agglomeration (e.g. caused by low melting ash par-
ticles), ash deposition and corrosion. Furthermore, chemically inert
material is used to inhibit reactions between fuel ash and bed mate-
rials. An exception are sulfur-rich fuels (e.g. pet-coke), where lime-
stone is added to the bed material, in order to reduce SO2 emissions.
The combustion air is injected using jets from below and depending
on gas velocity, particle size and density of the bed material, bed
material is entrained in the flow (CFB) or it remains in a bubbling
bed (BFB - stationary fluidized bed). CFB systems circulate the bed
material and require a separation unit, typically a cyclone. These sys-
tems enable a higher energy density and improved heat transfer
rates, however design and operation are more complex. Further-
more, bed material such as quartz is known to be erosive, leading to
erosion on heat exchanging surfaces and/or to the removal of depos-
its. Fluidized bed combustion systems are characterized by good
mixing characteristics between fuel, combustion air and the bed
material and thus a high momentum and heat transfer leading to a
uniform temperature distribution.

Fluidized bed systems are typically built in medium size, from 30
to 350 MWel, for troublesome fuel ashes or fuels with a low volatile
content and thus low combustibility (e.g. pet-coke or sewage sludge
with a high moisture content). Typical fuels are waste wood, pet-
coke, solid recovered fuels (SRF) in the form of pellets or sewage
sludge [27(cid:1)29]. The fuels’ high ash content and low ash melting
temperature can be handled through a moderate and uniform tem-
perature enabled by the good mixing behavior inside the bed mate-
rial. The biggest concerns for operators are bed reactions and
agglomeration. Bed agglomeration can lead to a decrease in heat
transfer and fluidization. In extreme events it may lead to the total
defluidization of the bed, resulting in unscheduled plant shut down
[30]. Bed agglomeration is often caused by chemical reactions of
inorganic vapors or molten phases of salts and/or silicates. These
mechanisms and ash species can lead to coating, adhesion and sin-
tering between sand particles [30,31]. Slagging is rarely reported for
FB combustion, due to low temperatures and erosion by bed mate-
rial, compared to grate firing or PF systems.

Grate combustion is typically used for low-grade fuels with
troubling ash behavior. Commonly used fuels are municipal solid
wastes (MSW), straw or wood including waste wood, forest residues
or demolition wood. The fuel is burned without pretreatment on a
moving grate, where combustion air is supplied from beneath. Mod-
ern systems use a staged air supply, where the combustion zone on
the grate uses low stoichiometries in order to suppress nitric oxides.

bling fluidized bed, CFB: circulating fluidized bed, PF: pulverized fuel, MSW: municipal solid waste, SRF: solid recovered fuels (Figure modified and D

Xextended from [33]).

A substantial part of the inorganic material is transported out of the
systems as solid ash particles and agglomerates via the grate. How-
ever, small ash particles and inorganic vapors can be entrained by
combustion gases. They are liberated from the grate and transported
through the flue gas duct of the boiler. The first duct is typically
cladded in order to prevent the boiler wall from deposition of molten
ash particles and excessive corrosion. Steam temperatures are often
limited to values below 500 °C, due to high chlorine contents in the
raw fuel, and, thus, the threat of high temperature chlorine-induced
corrosion. Studies on straw grate firing have shown that fly ash is
enriched in salt species consisting mainly of K, S and Cl, compared to
bottom ash, which is silicate like and rich in K, Ca and Si [32]. This fly
ash can lead to severe operational problems such as slagging in the
furnace or fouling at lower temperatures further downstream, e.g.
on secondary or tertiary superheaters.

When comparing combustion systems, the power plant size, final
steam temperature and the net electrical efficiency increase typi-
cally in the order: grate firing, FB and PF as illustrated in Fig. 1. The
choice of combustion system is mainly depending on the fuel, its
availability and inorganic constituents. Fig. 2 shows steam tempera-
tures for different firing systems as a function of thermal input. The
steam temperature is directly connected to the plant electrical effi-
ciency. The highest steam temperatures are currently obtained for
supercritical coal-fired power plants, where the latest built genera-
tion reaches values slightly above 600 °C and 285 bar. In addition,
Fig. 2 shows current steam temperatures of biomass-fired combus-
tion systems. It can be seen that medium to large-scale systems with
a thermal input of 10(cid:1)200 MWth have relatively low steam tempera-
tures (cid:1) up to 540 °C (cid:1) compared to the latest design values of
ultra supercritical coal-fired power stations, which exceed 700 °C at
330 bar. Currently, the highest steam temperatures in biomass com-
bustion are found in a tangentially-fired PF system operated by
DONG Energy. In 2000, DONG commissioned unit 2 at Avedore Den-
mark, a 563 MWel, supercritical coal-fired boiler with 600 °C steam
temperature and an electrical efficiency of 46%. The unit was con-
verted to high-quality wood pellets in 2004. The operator had to
reduce the steam temperature to 540 °C in order to reduce the risk

of ash deposition and corrosion. In 2006, they introduced coal fly ash
injection to avoid the corrosive environment and to increase steam
temperatures to 560 °C, which led to an electrical efficiency of 43.8%.
The process was successful, however, mechanisms are still not
understood. Coal fly ash is assumed to absorb potassium, which oth-
erwise forms corrosive KCl-rich inner deposits on superheater tubes.
This conversion shows the main problem of today’s power genera-
tion from solid biomass: deposition and corrosion caused by
inorganic species. Even with high-quality wood pellets, steam tem-
peratures are limited. This is even more troubling when using straw
and other chlorine-rich biomasses. They are typically burned in sys-
tems with much lower steam temperatures, as shown in Fig. 2.
Lower temperatures are mainly caused by the threat of severe ash
deposit formation and high-temperature chlorine-induced corrosion
[33]. An interesting approach was presented for grate-firing systems
in Masnedø and Maribo Sakskøbing, where the superheater design
was changed to so-called collecting superheaters. The new design
enabled an increase in final steam temperatures from 450 to 540 °C
by allowing the collection of ash deposits. Successful tests revealed a
protective oxide layer formation as a shield against chlorine-induced
corrosion [34].

Combustion systems also differ in process conditions, such as
particle size, flue gas temperatures, or flue gas velocities, as listed
beneath Fig. 1. With higher flue gas temperatures, ash particles are
softer/contain a higher fraction of melt and thus their tendency to
stick upon impaction on a surface increases. A higher flue gas veloc-
ity increases the particle kinetic energy, and thus the probability to
impact on walls, such as the boiler wall or tubes. A detailed discus-
sion on process conditions will be given in Section 4. Solid fuel com-
bustion in a furnace involves a number of complex steps releasing
chemically-bound energy as heat. Typically, there are four steps
describing the process of solid fuel combustion [35,36]: (1) drying
and release of moisture, (2) devolatilization, i.e. thermal decomposi-
tion and release of volatile matter, (3) ignition and combustion of
volatile matter, (4) and char combustion. Char combustion is known
as the slowest step and the parameter determining the furnace
height in PF combustion systems. Char combustion has to be

literature, but mainly four groups of inorganic constituents are used
for coals and biomass:

(cid:3) Dissolved salts and other inorganic substances in the fuel mois-
ture. In coals they can originate from contact with sea water,
and are contained in the pore water. In biomass, such as wood
or straw, dissolved salts originate from the liquid phases inside
the plants. Elements are typically found as cations of K+, Na+,
Ca2+ and anions Cl-, HPO4

completed before particles can enter the superheating region. Other-
wise, particle temperatures are too high due to the exothermic oxi-
dation and ash is molten, thereby increasing the sticking propensity
and the risk of corrosion. During the process of combustion, inor-
ganic constituents transform physically and chemically and form the
remaining ash, which is dominated by solid ash particles. However,
inorganics can also be found as gaseous species, as liquid droplets
or as solids, depending on the fuel and flue gas temperature. The
following sections focus on observations made in experiments
and their implication for numerical models. They include an over-

inorganics, as well as fundamentals of ashD

(cid:3) Organically-bound ash-forming compounds: Inorganic ele-
ments that are incorporated in organic compounds (e.g. in the
macerals of coals). Typically these are cations including K+, Na+,
Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe3+, Al3+. A further group consists of covalently
bonded non-metals such as organic S, P or Cl.

(cid:3) Included minerals found as discrete inorganic particles within
the fuel matrix, either crystalline or non-crystalline, represent-
ing mineral components. Within coals, these included mineral
grains are often finely dispersed and intimately mixed with the
organic substance and therefore difficult to remove. Within
woody biomass, typical minerals are composed of Ca, Si, Mg;
where Ca is frequently found in the form of calcium oxalate
CaC2O4, which forms crystals during the drying of wood-based
fuels. In the case of herbaceous fuels such as straw, soluble Si in
the form of silicic acid Si(OH)4 is transported within the cell
walls and enriches in insoluble SiO2 leading to the strengthening
of the plant tissue.

(cid:3) Excluded minerals, are liberated from the organic structure. For
coals this can occur during the coalification process or during
milling in the power station. Typical excluded mineral grains are
quartz, pyrite or clay minerals. In the case of biomass, impurities
originate from the soil or contaminants attached to the plant.
Typical representatives are clay minerals in the form of alumino-
silicats (rich in K, Na, Ca and Fe), feldspars or quartz.

2.2. Fuel inorganic constituents

A substantial part of solid fuels can be inorganic in nature and is
difficult to remove from the organic substance. This ash forming
matter varies strongly among different fuel types, and for coal it can
range from as low as 2 wt.% in a clean feedstock up to 40 wt.% for
low-grade lignite. Unfortunately, there is large confusion and misun-
derstanding of definitions for inorganic constituents in the literature.
A commonly used classification for inorganic material in solid fuels
is presented by Ward [37]; where similar definitions go back to the
pioneering work of Benson and Holm [38] applied for a low-grade
coal. Work in the field of biomass can be found in the publication of
Zevenhoven et al. [6], Werkelin et al. [4,135], Marschner [39] or Vas-
silev et al. [5]. It has to be mentioned that definitions differ in

Fig. 3 shows the most common forms: organically-bound inor-
ganics, included and excluded mineral grains (not illustrated are dis-
solved salts). Ward [37] describes the first two groups (dissolved
salts and organically-bound inorganics) as non-mineral inorganics.
The amount of these inorganic constituents strongly depends on the
fuel rank. An estimate on the amount of these elements can be found
in Fig. 4 based on various literature references. The lowest quantity
is typically observed for bituminous coals. Typical elements are
alkali metals (Na, K), alkaline earth metals (Ca and Mg), P, S and Cl.
High-rank coal inorganics have around 5(cid:1)10 wt.% of these non-min-
eral inorganics, low-rank coals such as lignites or brown coals typi-
cally 10(cid:1)40 wt.% of the total amount of inorganics [15,38]. In the
case of biomass, this strongly depends on the plant type, where her-
baceous biomass such as straw has around 15(cid:1)58 wt.% (estimated

from data of e.g. [40(cid:1)42]), and wood-based feedstocks range from
12 up to 56 wt.% (estimated from data of e.g. [43(cid:1)45,52]). An inter-
esting biomass that produces low quantities of inorganic vapors is
rice husk. Rice husks are extremely rich in silicon, as shown in
Table 1D
X. Inorganics in rice husks are non-leachable as shown by
chemical fractionation studies [53]. Based on these results it is esti-
mated that the amount of vaporizable elements is very low, probably
below 5 wt.%. However, it has to be mentioned that the amount is
difficult to determine and strongly dependent on the fuel, the tem-
perature during conversion, the heating rate, the residence time at a
certain temperature, and the measurement device. These inorganic
components (Al, Ca, Cl, Fe, K, Mg, Na, Si, S, Ti and trace elements) can
be covalently and ionically bound to the organic matter. The ele-
ments are present in ion-exchangeable forms and as salts of carbox-
ylic acids within the organic matter [56]. Dissolved salts in coals can
for instance originate from contact with sea water. In addition,
plants have soluble salts in their liquid phases [6]. Both groups, dis-
solved salts and organically-bound elements are known to vaporize

during the combustion, leading to inorganic vapors in the gas phase.
These vapors can re-condense to small particles, referred to as aero-
sols or sub-micron ash particles. A method that might be suitable in
order to estimate the amount of vaporizable inorganics is chemical
fractionation, often referred to as leaching. During this method, the
fuel samples are dissolved in various solvents and the remaining res-
idue and eluate are analyzed [38]. There are several methods and
procedures described in literature [61]. Typical solvents are deion-
ized water, ammonium acetate and hydrochloric acid. Elements that
are leachable in the first two, are assumed to be vaporizable. Chemi-
cal fractionation of coals was for instance done in projects Sodium
[54] and Calcium [55] at the Energy & Environmental Research Cen-
ter (EERC) in early 1990s; see also Benson and Holm [38]. Chemical
fractionation results of commonly used biomass can be found in the
work of Zevenhoven et al. [6].

Discrete inorganic particles are often referred to as mineral mat-
ter in the fuel [56]. They are present as mineral grains within the
organic matter or separated from it. Most minerals are in crystalline

form, however some can exist as amorphous phases. Both transform
during the combustion and the remaining residue is referred to as
ash. Strictly, ash is the remaining solid residue after complete con-
version [15]. However, literature is not consistent and an incorrect
use of the terms ash, inorganic constituents and mineral matter is
common. The amount, chemical composition and size distribution of
ash is highly-dependent on the fuel and the form of inorganic con-
stituents as well as the combustion system (temperatures, atmos-
pheres) and fuel preparation (e.g. grinding, washing). Laboratory ash
has a considerably different temperature- and time-history com-
pared to ash samples collected in power plants. Furthermore, the
atmosphere (i.e. oxidizing or reducing) will influence ash character-
istics. Unfortunately, there is inaccuracy in the literature, and prepa-
ration or sampling techniques are often not stated clearly. Particular
care must be taken for obtaining representative samples. This is less
important in laboratory-scale, but can be of great importance in a PF
boiler, as the amount analyzed is extremely small compared to mass
flow rates in a full-scale furnace [15]. Furthermore, information on
the feedstock and its origin (e.g. coal mine and storage) is missing in
most studies. By knowing the amount of remaining ash, empirical
correlations can be used to estimate the mineral matter content in
the raw fuel. There are empirical equations in literature, which relate
the mass fraction of mineral matter wm to the proximate ash yield wa
and the total sulfur content wS,D
Xtotal, such as the one suggested by Parr
[58] given by:

Equations relating ash yield to mineral matter content exhibit high
uncertainties. These equations are often derived for high-tempera-
ture ashing and therefore, a significant amount of inorganic matter
is already released to the gas phase. Generally speaking, inorganic
matter transforms, decomposes and releases gaseous components
during conversion. Typical components are H2O, CO2, Cl2, HCl, SO2
or H2S depending on conditions and stoichiometry [59,60]. There-
fore, in most correlations, the mineral matter content in the raw
fuel is around 10% higher than the final ash content. The sulfur con-
tent, wS,D
Xtotal, contributes to some extent to the ash yield depending
on its occurrence. Sulfur can be either present in the form of
organic sulfur bound to the coal structure, as sulphides originating
from e.g. pyrite, sulphates, e.g. CaSO4, or as elemental sulfur [35].
Detailed information and discussion of mineral transformations
and decompositions are provided in the following sections. Vassilev
and Tasc(cid:2)on [56] come to another order. They argue that coal ash is
the inorganic residue resulting from incineration of coal and that it
is composed of original and new-formed inorganic phases gener-
ated from both inorganic and organic matter [56]. They state
that the magnitude should be in the order of ash > inorganic mat-
ter > mineral matter; where the mineral matter is a part of the
inorganic matter and organically-bound inorganic compounds are
not included in the inorganic matter according to their definition
[56]. However, lower values of ash than mineral matter are com-
monly observed when ash is produced at high temperatures and

inorganic constituents volatilize [56] and minerals decompose. Fur-
thermore, it has to be mentioned that measuring the amount of
inorganic matter and mineral matter is highly difficult and an accu-
rate and reliable method is currently not available. Different forms
of inorganic compounds, various mineral types and the heterogene-
ity of solid fuels are the main reasons for the inconsistency and
confusion in literature.

A compilation of different fuel types and their ash characteristics
is presented in Table 2. Six major groups - comprising of bituminous
coal, lignite, herbaceous biomass such as straw or grasses, woody
biomass, manures and sludges as well as waste-based fuels - are
summarized in terms of typical heating value, ash content, ash
fusion (fluid) temperature and major ash forming elements. By
far the highest ash content is observed for waste-based fuels and
manures such as sewage sludge with values up to 50 wt.% on a dry
basis (d.b.). There are some reports of lignites with very high ash
contents, however typical coals have lower values between 10 and
20 wt.% (d.b.). Bituminous coals are dominated by Si, Al and Fe,
which mainly originate from mineral grains composed of aluminosi-
licates, quartz or pyrite depending on the coal seam. The bulk ash
fusion temperatures are fairly high, usually at around 1200 up to
1500 °C. However, there can be single particles with low melting
eutectics with considerably lower melting temperatures in particu-
lar for iron bearing mineral grains. Lignites can vary widely and are
often dominated by Ca, Mg, Fe, S and Si. Frequently found minerals
are carbonates, gypsum, quartz and many others. Melting tempera-
tures are typically slightly lower, compared with bituminous coals.
Very low melting temperatures down to 950 °C are observed for
straw and grasses, mainly due to the high potassium content. Si, Al,
K species - found within the plant - can form low melting ash par-
ticles. This together with high chlorine contents leave straw to be
a troublesome fuel. On the contrary, wood-based fuels are often
reported to be less problematic. The have relativity high melting
temperatures, mainly due to the abundance of calcium. The majority
of ash forming elements is found within the bark - with ash contents
of 5-8 wt.% (d.b.). Very difficult and heterogeneous fuels are manures
and waste-based fuels, such as MSW or SRF, demolition wood and
other residues. Manures are often rich in phosphorus and heavy
metals, leading to problems concerning the ash utilization. A further
summary of major ash forming species and their quantity within
different solid fuels is presented in Table 1. Different groups com-
prise of bituminous coals, lignites and different biomass including
Nordic wood, herbaceous biomass and agricultural residues. Woody
biomass is differentiated into bulk wood, bark, twigs, needles and
leaves. The table reveals that woody biomass is dominated by Ca
and K making up for around 65 mol.%, followed by Mg and S. Twigs,
needles and leaves have an increased content of K and P compared
with bark and stem wood. Furthermore, it is shown that bark,
twigs, shoots, needles and leaves have a strongly increased content
of inorganic matter, up to ten times higher, compared with stem
wood. The amount of inorganics found in annual biomass is similar
to bark in the range of 3(cid:1)10 wt.% of the fuel. Inorganic species in

annual biomass, such as straw or grasses, are dominated by Si, K
and a fairly high Cl content.

Fig. 5 shows a back-scattered electron (BSE) microscope image of
unprocessed wood (a) and straw (b). In BSE images, the intensity of
the signal and thus the intensity of gray in the image is strongly
related to the mean atomic number of elements in the sample.
Therefore, minerals with high atomic numbers appear brighter,
compared to the organic structure or the embedding material with
lower atomic numbers. Wood, shown in Fig. 5(a), is in general a very
clean feedstock with a low amount of excluded mineral grains or
contaminants such as soil, sand or clay minerals. Most of the inor-
ganic species are found embedded within the organic, regular wood
matrix. They are typically 1-10 mm large grains composed of crystal-
line calciumoxalate or carbonates. Particles can contain Ca, Mg or
Na as either silicates, or sulfates up to 40 mm [66]. The ash content
of straw is increased compared to wood. A typical straw stem is
shown in Fig. 5(b). The Energy research Centre of the Netherlands
(ECN) estimated that around 75% of the Si is found in quartz par-
ticles, which are either embedded in the organic straw matrix up to
25 mm or form thin continuous linings at the outside of the straw
stem [66]. In addition, some clay minerals containing Mg and/or Ca
were found during the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and
SEM/EDX (energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) analyses.

A very powerful characterization method for inorganic constitu-
ents and their variation within one sample is the so-called “com-
puter-controlled scanning electron microscopy” (CCSEM) analysis.
This method allows to analyze the raw fuel sample directly without
any thermal pretreatment such as ashing in a muffle furnace. The
fuel is mount in epoxy, cut and the cross-section is polished. Conven-
tional SEM or CCSEM are often applied for the identification (type,
form and size) and quantification of minerals in coals. Fig. 6 shows a
BSE microscope image of bituminous coal particles. It can be seen
that a substantial fraction of the mineral matter is excluded from the
fuel matrix. Additionally, the amount and number of mineral inclu-
sions vary widely among different coal particles. Therefore, scanning
electron microscopy is a key method for developing a detailed fuel
model for numerical codes.

The CCSEM technique was developed during the late 1970’s and
early 80’s when computer supported electron microscopy became
available. The first studies using computer-controlled SEM techni-
ques focused on classifying the mineral size distribution and compo-
sition within pulverized coals [67]. Steadman et al. [269] and
Zygarlicke et al. [68] were among the first to differentiate between
included and excluded minerals. During CCSEM, coal particles are
mounted in an embedding material which is polished, carbon coated

between included and excluded minerals, a distinct contrast
between the embedding material and coal matrix is needed. Two
possible methods can be found in the literature. The best contrast on
the BSE pictures is derived using carnauba wax. Another method is
to increase the average atomic number by dissolving ten percent
iodoform in epoxy resin [69]. This resin is then mixed with coal par-
ticles and hardener. Once the sample is polished and carbon-coated,
the cross-section can be investigated using SEM. CCSEM can be
applied for coal, char and ash particle characterization. Typical
results provide information on the mineral composition, its size and
type (excluded or included). Eleven elements are detected most
commonly including Al, Ca, Cl, Fe, K, Mg, Na, P, Si, S and Ti. The sam-
ple is scanned automatically by computer and X-ray detectors are
used to quantify elements of individual mineral grains. The composi-
tion of a mineral grain is then compared with a database of mineral
compositions and subsequently classified. It has to be mentioned
that a classification leads to a loss in information. For instance, a
mineral grain with a composition close to quartz is classified as pure
quartz (SiO2). Typical minerals in the system include quartz,

kaolinite, pyrite, rutile, montmorillonite, apatite, gypsum, various
silicates, and many others [3].

CCSEM analysis can provide very useful details and insight in
the heterogeneity of a solid fuel, as shown in Fig. 7. Monroe [23]
detected around 6000 mineral grains for a Kentucky No. 9 coal. It is
shown that mineral grain composition varies widely within one fuel
sample and therefore, each mineral grain has its own transformation
and melting point. Where classic ash oxide analysis yields just one
average point, CCSEM illustrates a number of points with varying
composition. CCSEM is able to provide information on the variation
in chemical composition, form and size of minerals. However, this
method has to be applied with care. There are some limitations
and disadvantages when using CCSEM techniques. Ignoring these
limitations can lead to different results and wrong conclusions. For
instance, particles in the sub-micrometer range cannot be detected
without using very high magnifications, which is impracticable. A
sufficiently high number of particles have to be analyzed in order to
obtain statistically meaningful and quantitative results. Typical
results are in the range of 2000-4000 particles. This is of special
interest when a broad particle size distribution (PSD) has to be char-
acterized. Furthermore, using different magnifications can lead to
different results and more importantly, Sarofim and Helble [70] dis-
cuss that particle sizes in a cross-section are artificially shifted
towards smaller diameters (due to the effect that the probability to
intersect a sphere at its pole is low). Another problem is associated
with the electron beam size. The size of the beam restricts the lower
limit of mineral inclusions to about 1 mm, depending on the magnifi-
cation. Often, small clusters of two or more different mineral grains
close to each other and with different chemistry cannot be distin-
guished, and results show a misleading composition. Furthermore,
they are classified as one instead of multiple grains. The penetration
depth of the beam is also a parameter affecting the lower detection
limit. Furthermore, atomically-dispersed elements, i.e. organically-
bound inorganics, cannot be identified or quantified.

Although information on mineral-mineral (two different mineral
grains in a cluster close to each other) or mineral-maceral associa-
tion can be determined, commercially available CCSEM analyses do
not provide such data. It is often difficult to differentiate between
coal particles and resin; hence an automatic procedure is not appli-
cable. There are only a few studies on the mineral-organic associa-
tion using CCSEM [72(cid:1)75]. An interesting approach is the QEMSCAN
system, developed at CSIRO [76,77]. QEMSCAN describes a method
that directly enables the measurement of mineral matter - organic
matter association on a particle-by-particle basis. The difference
compared to CCSEM analysis is that coal particles are included in the
analysis and the whole cross-section is analyzed pixel by pixel.
Mounting medium and coal particles are distinguished by the
brightness of the BSE picture, and the X-ray spectrum. Around
4 000 particles are required for statistically significant results [78].
Studies on the distribution of inorganic constituents in solid fuels
are rare in literature. Typically, CCSEM analyses are carried out pro-
viding information on the amount and type of included and excluded
mineral grains. However, CCSEM analyses are not covering organi-
cally-bound inorganics and do not give information on the associa-
tion of the coal matrix with mineral grains. A study of Liu et al. [78]
uses the QEMSCAN technique to determine the mineral-maceral
association for 14 different Australian coals. The most abundant par-
ticle type found by Liu et al. [78] were particles without mineral
grains. Only, about 10% of the particles’ cross-sections contained
mineral inclusions. They defined three particle classes, based on
these findings. Class 1: coal particles with 95% or more area covered
with organic substance, class 2: particles with included minerals
containing 40(cid:1)90% organic substance, and class 3: excluded mineral
grains, containing less than 40% organic substance. According to this
classification, the majority of the studied coal samples had an
included mineral matter content in the area of 50(cid:1)80%. There was
just one sample with more excluded than included minerals [78]. In
a later study, Liu and co-workers [79] investigated the mineral-

mineral association of excluded mineral grains. They studied three
different coals and the corresponding ashes after combustion in a
drop-tube furnace at 1400 °C, and came to the conclusion that illite,
ankerite and siderite change their shape to spherical particles, while
quartz, kaolinite and calcite do not show significant changes. They
found mineral associations of quartz and kaolinite in excluded min-
eral grains, whereas combined particles of carbonates with silicates
were rare [79].

Mineral matter is often reported to be enriched in smaller parti-
cle sizes. This trend has been observed in several studies [12,80(cid:1)84]
and can be explained by the fuel grinding process. Unsworth et al.
[82] state that particles with high mineral matter content and thus
high particle densities tend to be ground to a finer size and may lib-
erate mineral grains. This is based on the effect of a classifier mill,
which recycles heavier particles. Only if the particle inertia is low
enough, the gas flow can entrain the particle. In particular higher-
rank coals tend to demonstrate this behavior [15].

Data on the number of mineral grains per particle and their dis-
tribution among coal particle sizes are rare. Barta et al [72,86] devel-
oped the so-called “urn” model using CCSEM data. They used a
Poisson law in order to distribute mineral grains among individual
coal particles. SEM investigations of a size-graded Texas lignite
(63(cid:1)75 mm) revealed a mean value of 15 mineral inclusions per coal
particle. Particles were embedded in epoxy resin, cut and polished
for measurements using a back-scattered electron detector. An
inverse Abelian transformation is applied, in order to obtain vol-
ume-based size distributions. The Poisson distribution law is used to
describe the number of mineral inclusions per coal particle. For n
mineral inclusions in m coal particles the probability Pj of finding j
mineral particles in a coal particle is calculated by the following
equation [72]:

;

where λ 1⁄4 n=m; the mean number of mineral grains per coal particle
and j is the number of mineral grains per coal particle, which can
take an integer value of 0 to n [70,72]. Eq. (2) is less accurate for coals
with a high content of included mineral matter. The number of min-
eral inclusions n per coal particle of a given size dp,D

particle is rarely found in literature. A similar approach was followed
by Monroe [23], who used SEM to measure the mineral size of Ken-
tucky #9 coal, with a varying degree of cleaning. Monroe used a
Monte Carlo method to distribute mineral matter among individual
coal particles. Although there are some studies evaluating mineral
size and distribution, general rules are not identified, and each fuel
needs to be investigated separately. This is of particular concern for
biomass with low mineral matter content. Often, power plant opera-
tors use more simplified and cheaper methods in order to determine
the slagging and fouling potential of fuels. One of the first tests for
new purchased fuels is the popular ash fusion test.

This laboratory test is applied to study the ash melting behavior
under controlled conditions. Ash samples, typically produced in a
muffle furnace, are pressed to a specimen, heated up under a con-
trolled atmosphere and observed with an optical system. The silhou-
ette recorded from the sample is judged to identify critical
temperatures. There are several standards available in literature for
ash sample preparation and ash fusion tests. According to Couch
[15], the available standards differ quite significantly in terms of

from Hansen et al. [87], h: height and w: width of the silhouette).

specimen preparation and characteristic temperatures. Specimen
and silhouettes of characteristic temperatures are illustrated for the
American standard in Fig. 8. These characteristic temperatures are
referred to, as initial deformation temperature (IDT), softening (ST),
hemispherical (HT) and fluid temperature (FT), respectively. Ash
fusion temperatures are often used by boiler designers for selecting
the maximum furnace exit temperature and for the estimation of
slagging propensities using indices and the bulk ash chemistry. The
ash fusion test for biomass uses different characteristic tempera-
tures. Ash samples derived from biomass show a shrinking specimen
and therefore the IDT is replaced by the so-called shrinkage starting
temperature (SST). The second characteristic temperature is called
deformation temperature (DT), whereas the rest is identical. Gener-
ally speaking, the applicability of the ash fusion test is questionable.
Couch [15] states that laboratory ash is considerably different due to
the slow formation process compared to conditions in a boiler. Labo-
ratory ash absorbs SO3 from sulphates and oxygen from ferric oxides
which does not occur in a boiler. Furthermore, heterogeneity
strongly influences ash melting temperatures. For example, quartz
grains distributed within the specimen lead to a strong compound
structure and ash fusion temperatures are often quite high, even
though most of the other ash particles are already molten. Van Dyk
et al. [88] reported that low viscosity ashes can have a high molten
fraction without changing the geometry of the specimen. Another
important parameter is the atmosphere under which the test is car-
ried out. The atmosphere can be selected either as oxidizing or
reducing. It is reported in literature that reducing conditions lead to
lower ash fusion temperatures, typically around 50 K. A dominant
role exhibit iron minerals and their transformation under reducing
conditions [15]. Bryers [89] correlates the ash softening temperature
under reducing conditions for eight eastern US coals to the sum of
basic compounds in the ash. A parabolic curve can be found with the
minimum temperature at approximately 50 wt.% of basic com-
pounds. Therefore, the amount of basic compounds in the fuel can
help to estimate the threat of slagging and fouling. However,
detailed information on individual particles, which might melt at
much lower temperatures (50(cid:1)250 K), can only be obtained by SEM
methods. Furthermore, detailed predictions on ash formation, in
terms of ash particle size distribution and chemistry, can only be
conducted if SEM data is available.

2.3. Ash formation

Ash formation in solid fuel combustion systems involves several
mechanisms and processes, producing gases, liquids - in the form of
melts - and solids. There are three main aspects: the first, and proba-
bly most important one, being the distribution of inorganic constitu-
ents in the fuel matrix, which has been discussed in the previous
section. Secondly, inorganic constituents undergo physical transfor-
mation including melting, fusion, vaporization, fragmentation, etc.
And thirdly, inorganic constituents decompose and transform to ash,

which is dependent on process parameters such as flue gas tempera-
ture and composition. This process is often referred to as chemical
or mineral transformation. The following sections address each of
the two latter aspects, and summarize the current state of the art.

2.3.1. Physical transformations of inorganic constituents

Inorganic constituents in solid fuels undergo physical transfor-
mation processes, which are strongly dependent on the conditions
inside the boiler, and on the fuel itself [14]. Possible physical trans-
formations of inorganic constituents are:

(cid:3) coalescence of mineral inclusions within the particle or on the

particle surface [9,12,70,86,91,96,104],

(cid:3) shedding of mineral or ash particles from char surfaces

[91(cid:1)93,165],

(cid:3) coal/char particle fragmentation and incomplete coalescence of

minerals [93(cid:1)96,104,114,115,118,122],

(cid:3) fragmentation of excluded minerals due to mineral transforma-

tions [12,79,183,540],

(cid:3) formation of inorganic ceno- or plerospheres [57,97],
(cid:3) vaporization of mineral species, their re-condensation and

agglomeration [12,73,91(cid:1)93], and

(cid:3) vaporization of salts and release of organically-bound in-
organics [43(cid:1)45], their chemical reaction with ash particles
[48(cid:1)51,261,262], and their condensation [98(cid:1)103, 212].

Fig. 9 illustrates the process of ash formation. It occurs along with
devolatilization, char conversion and subsequent flue gas cooling.
Depending on the fuel, a considerable amount of inorganic constitu-
ents may vaporize. Mainly, organically-associated inorganic com-
pounds are released as inorganic vapors, during devolatilization and
char conversion. These inorganic vapors are illustrated by open
arrows, whereas solid particles are shown with filled arrows, in
Fig. 9. Remaining inorganic constituents, mainly mineral matter,
decompose, transform to ash, melt and coalesce (fuse together)
depending on the mineral type and temperatures. The behavior of
included minerals is complex. Most ash particles have a sufficiently
high surface tension to form liquid droplets and thus, do no wet the
char particle surface [57]. Included mineral grains are often reported
to coalesce during char conversion. During coalescence, mineral
inclusions come into contact with each other and fuse to one
remaining ash particle. Coalescence of mineral inclusions has been
investigated by several authors. Sarofim and Helble [70] suggest the
full coalescence model as a good starting point for estimating the

ash particle size distribution. In this model, every coal particle yields
exactly one ash particle. The full coalescence model yields the largest
possible particle size distribution (assuming no particle-particle col-
lisions in the bulk flow). The opposite behavior and lower boundary
for the ash PSD, is the so-called no coalescence model, where every
mineral grain yields one ash particle. Eq. (4) can be used to estimate

In this equation, the mineral matter content equals the ash content.
Sarofim and Helbe [70] refer to a publication of Wall et al. [71], not-
ing that Eq. (4) is less accurate for coals with high shares of included
mineral matter content (e.g. wa > 20 wt.%). For such coals, the vol-
ume occupied by the ash has to be considered. Wilemski and Srini-
vasachar [104] successfully used a Monte Carlo method for the
mineral distribution in combination with the full coalescence model
for the prediction of ash size distribution. However, the same model
failed for a highly cleaned coal, which showed excessive fragmenta-
tion behavior. Barta et al. [86] developed the random coalescence
model in combination with a char combustion model, providing lim-
its for the coalescence of mineral inclusion. The model is based on
input from CCSEM analyses. This model uses a simple char burnout
formulation with two subsequent steps. In the beginning, char con-
version is assumed to occur in the diffusion-limited regime with a
shrinking particle diameter. Mineral inclusions are released step by
step and assumed to adhere to the surface as molten particles. If ash
particles get in contact due to a shrinking char structure, they start
to coalesce. In the next step, the combustion is assumed to be in the
kinetically-limited regime. Particles now burn from the inside and
the diameter is unchanged. By this approach, coalescence is inter-
rupted, and char particles break up once they reach a critical poros-
ity. A further development was presented by Yan et al. [9] for high-
rank coals using CCSEM data. Included and excluded minerals were
treated differently. Included minerals were distributed randomly
among coal particles using Poisson distribution. The authors found
that small particles do not fuse together. Best agreement is reported
when using a partial coalescence model as shown in Fig. 10. An
interesting ash formation model for CFD codes is presented in a

remaining ash. A similar model considering different char particle
shapes was presented by Wu and co-authors [105]. Fig. 12 shows
the ash formation mechanism postulated for different char types
and included minerals. Typically, three different char types are
reported in literature [163,164]: type I chars are spherical to sub-
spherical particles with thin walls ( < 5 mm) and high porosity val-
ues, so-called cenospheres. Type II particles show a sub-spherical
shape with medium porosity, almost no swelling and variable wall
thicknesses. And type III chars, which are relatively dense, have an
angular shape and a swelling coefficient smaller than unity. Wu
et al. [105] used a size-graded and density-fractionated Australian
bituminous coal and studied their conversion in a drop-tube furnace
at 1300 °C, atmospheric pressure and air. The coal sample was in a
narrow size range of 63(cid:1)90 mm and excluded minerals were
removed by sink/float separation with an upper specific gravity of
2.0 g/cm3 [105]. Combustion took place in the diffusion-limited
regime. Depending on the char type, a different degree of coales-
cence is assumed. Char type III forms one remaining ash particle,
whereas for char type I every mineral inclusion forms an individual
ash particle. Thus, information on char structure is necessary accord-
ing to the authors. They further argued that different char types have
different observed reactivities. Char type I is assumed to fragment
and burn four times faster than the dense and less porous char type
III. This might also be due to different specific surface areas of vary-
ing char types. Char fragmentation of type I seems to determine ash
formation during early stages of combustion, while the formation of
coarse fly ash particles occurs by coalescence of included mineral
matter during late stages of combustion [105]. Syred et al. [121] give
an overview on mechanisms leading to particle fragmentation.
Reasons can be:

(cid:3) thermal stresses [126(cid:1)130],
(cid:3) pressure-induced fracture during devolatilization [94,133],

study of Zhou et al. [454]. The model accounts for ash layer collapse
during char burnout and assumes coalescence. Such a model should
be extended for char fragmentation and should be validated with
measurements. In this case char fragmentation becomes important.
Char fragmentation was first mentioned 80 years ago by Davis and
Hottel [107] and is often given as an explanation for differences in
predictions and observations of particle size distributions or fly ash
formation. Fragmentation can occur during devolatilization, during
char combustion, or for excluded mineral grains,
in particular
minerals, which undergo thermal decomposition. The majority of lit-
erature references reporting fragmentation observed char fragmen-
tation. It is reported for different fuel ranks, however, mostly for
swelling coals. Char fragmentation influences ash formation, as
shown in Figs. 11 and 12, and therefore also the remaining particle
size distribution as well as char conversion rates. The onset and
extent of char fragmentation can be predicted using percolation
models [109,116,477,478]. When the particle reaches a critical
porosity, typically around 0.8, but values scatter in-between 0.2 up
to 0.96 [113,125], it is assumed to fragment, where the number of
fragments is dependent on the particle size, char structure and
many other parameters [96]. Furthermore, the initial char structure
is known to affect the ash formation. Wilemski and Srinivasachar
proposed a fragmentation model for cenospherical particles, where
particles break up into a certain number of fragments as shown by
Fig. 11. Mineral grains in these fragments fuse together and form the

gressively erodes the solid network [108(cid:1)111,131,168,169]

Fragmentation is often divided into primary and secondary frag-
mentation. Primary fragmentation refers to fragmentation induced
by mechanical stresses (thermal or pressure), mostly during devola-
tilization, whereas secondary fragmentation is related to char con-
version induced by coalescence of large pores at late stages of
burnout (percolation) [112]. Experiments on fragmentation cover a
broad range of fuels and carbons with different process parameters
such as temperature, oxygen partial pressure and particle size.
Table 3 summarizes experimental investigations on fragmentation,
listing the fuel, particle size and the observed mechanism of frag-
mentation. Evaluation of this data indicates the predominant role of
a percolative nature of char fragmentation.

Char fragmentation during coal combustion strongly depends on
the particle size. Large particles are often reported to fragment due
to thermal stresses as shown in Table 3 and the work Senneca et al.
[114,133] or Dacombe et al. [112,128]. Small particles, typical for PF
combustion, on the other hand fragment due to percolative mecha-
nisms. The oxidation proceeds and erodes organic substance by
releasing ash particles sitting on the char surface. A similar mecha-
nism is expected to occur for biomass char. However, experimental
data on biomass fragmentation is rare and only recently studies
appeared. Fig. 13 shows spruce wood particles after pyrolysis. Cot-
ton-like agglomerations of small ash particles and Ca-rich crystals
are sitting on the char surface. It is assumed that these particles are
liberated during burnout. However, direct experimental evidence is
missing. Most of the studies on biomass presented in Table 3 were
under fluidized bed combustion conditions with relatively large
wood pellets or wood chips. In these cases, interaction between bed
material and fuel particles occurs. The majority of these studies
reported primary fragmentation during devolatilization together

with attrition of ash particles from surfaces, probably caused by
interactions between bed material and fuel. Percolative fragmenta-
tion during char conversion is also reported for biomass [120,125],
probably due to the fact that biomass chars have higher porosity val-
ues compared with coal [119].

Fragmentation and its extent is difficult to determine in experi-
ments, in particular for small particle sizes. Thermal stresses during
heating or the oxidation of thin particle structures will lead to frag-
mentation. One can imagine that particle sampling and collision
with tubes and boiler walls might also lead to fragmentation events,
which is not discussed in literature. There are many uncertainties
and sources of errors leading to a highly discussed field of research.
The conclusions drawn from Table 3 are:

(cid:3) char fragmentation is mainly percolative in nature and more

pronounced for large particles,

(cid:3) char fragmentation depends on the char type, and thus the mac-

eral composition in the case of coal,

(cid:3) the number of fragments increases with particle size, but varies

widely among literature,

(cid:3) cenospherical particles (type I chars) are the main source of frag-

ments,

(cid:3) char fragmentation most likely increases burning rates and the

amount of fine fly ash,

(cid:3) macro-porosity determines the extent of fragmentation with
critical porosity values reported mostly in between 0.7 and 0.95,
(cid:3) fragmentation can occur during devolatilization, mainly for bio-
mass and large particles, and is induced by thermal stresses and
internal pressure due to volatile release.

Shedding is illustrated in Fig. 14. During shedding, ash particles
sitting on the char particle surface experience forces, mainly shear
forces. These forces can detach the ash particle from the char struc-
ture and liberate it to the flow. Forces can be caused by particle rota-
tion or slip flow between the particle and gas. Particle rotation is
reported during devolatilization, where volatile jets evolve from

pores and openings. Studies on shedding are rare. Often shedding is
referred to as a fragmentation event, leading to small particles in the
range of 0.5(cid:1)5 mm [165(cid:1)167]. Helble [165] studied shedding using
two color pyrometry and found values as high as 1000 revolutions
per second for a 100 mm particle at the onset of char combustion.
Theoretical considerations including rotational and surface tension
forces showed that this effect is of minor importance for small, mol-
ten mineral grains sitting on the char surface. Nevertheless shedding
might be a source of small particles in large-scale boilers with highly
turbulent flow fields, when mineral grains are not properly attached
to the char surface; e.g. if they are solidified. This effect should be
studied in large-scale test rigs with considerably higher gas veloci-
ties (3(cid:1)15 m/s compared to 0.2(cid:1)2 m/s in lab-scale test rigs). Often it
is difficult to differentiate between shedding and fragmentation due
to the erosion of organic substance, called percolative fragmentation
[168,169].

The behavior of excluded mineralsD

Xdepends on the mineral type.
Quartz can be transported through the combustion system without
any changes and maintain its sharp, angular structure [57]. Other
excluded minerals such as clays can fragment during dehydration,
melt and form cenospheres or plerospheres, i.e. cenospheres filled
with small particles. The same can occur for carbonates. Pyrite is
reported to fragment more easily due to its framboidal structure

[57]. Both, coalescence and fragmentation have a significant effect
on the ash size distribution. The remaining ash particles formed by
coalescence and/or fragmentation are referred to as fly ash or coarse
fly ash and are in the range of 1(cid:1)50 mm for conventional PF combus-
tion systems. During ash formation, particles are transported
through the boiler with decreasing gas temperatures. Due to this
temperature decrease, inorganic vapors start to condense. The con-
densation can be divided into homogeneous and heterogeneous
condensation. The type of condensation is dependent on the super-
saturation ratio Si of the condensing species i. The supersaturation is
calculated by the ratio of the partial pressure of species i, pi, and its
saturation pressure psat,D
Xi at a certain location and temperature
(Si 1⁄4 pi=psat;i - see Section 2.5.3). Homogeneous condensation and
the nucleation of sub-micron particles takes place at supersaturation
ratios of approximately Si > 5 (numbers in literature range from 1 to
10 [170(cid:1)174]), whereas heterogeneous condensation is possible at
values above unity. Heterogeneous condensation can occur on other
particles (char or ash) or on heat exchanging surfaces. This layer can
be liquid and sticky or porous depending on the temperature. Both
homogeneous and heterogeneous condensation lead to the forma-
tion of sub-micron particles, and sub-micron modes depending on
where nucleation of vaporized metals occurs. At high concentrations
of these fine particulates, coagulation effects due to particle-particle

interactions can become important leading to agglomeration. This is
of great importance for biomass combustion with high shares of
inorganic vapors; see the work of Friedlander [171], J€oller [176],
Brunner [101] or Balan [175]. For a detailed experimental and theo-
retical investigation of fine particulate matter formation during pul-
verized coal combustion, it is also referred to the work of Wieland
[174]. Typical ash particle size distributions for a high-volatile bitu-
minous coal, El-Cerrej(cid:2)on, and barley straw are presented in Fig. 15.
The volume distribution is illustrated as a function of particle diame-
ter. The volume distribution equals the mass distribution, if every
particle has the same density. However, the heterogeneity in fly ash
samples has been observed in various studies, implying that volume
and mass distribution are not identical. Thus, the measurement of a
mass distribution requires the identification of individual particle
chemistry and size, and is therefore highly complex. Alternatively,
sieve analysis can be used for the coarse fly ash PSD. However, as
shown by Beckmann et al. [397], results can be misleading when
compared with other methods such as CCSEM or laser diffraction.
Furthermore, sieve analysis is difficult to apply for fly ashes with
small particle size, e.g. obtained in PF systems. Both ash samples
shown in Fig. 15 are derived from pulverized fuel combustion tests
in an entrained flow reactor (for details see the work of Balan [175]).
The ash particle size distribution shows two significant modes (local
maxima). The first mode is in the area of 0.1 < dp < 1 mm; the so-
called sub-micron ash. The second and dominant mode is typically
found around 20 mm. The ash sample of straw was collected using
an electrostatic low pressure impactor (ELPI) for particles smaller
than 10 mm, and a cyclone for larger particles [175]. The coal ash
sample was extracted with the cyclone only. Both cyclone ashes and
their size distributions were determined using the laser diffraction
method. Wieland [174] used the same coal and showed that the
amount of sub-micron ash is below 15 wt.% compared to coarse fly
ash. As expected, the straw ash has a considerably higher volume
fraction in the first mode compared to the coal ash sample. This is
mainly due to the high amount of vaporizable species, e.g. organi-
cally-associated cations in the straw, in particular potassium. How-
ever, uncertainties due to the sampling of the coal ash particles are
present and may lead to an increase of the first mode. Sarofim and
Helble [70] mention an additional smaller first mode in the range
of 0.02 < dp (cid:2) 0.1 mm, which is barely observed in Fig. 15. According
to their investigation, this very small, first peak is due to conden-
sation effects. However, they do not have an explanation for the

second mode in the range of 0.1(cid:1)1 mm. This mode might be
caused by percolative fragmentation of ash particles from the
burning char particle. Another interesting aspect is the plateau
at large particle sizes above 100 mm, which might be due to
unburnt carbon.
It seems that char conversion has a strong
impact on fly ash formation and only a combined approach
including the distribution of mineral matter in coal and a
detailed char conversion model is able to predict the remaining
ash particles and their properties. However, detailed information
on the fuel and char structure are required for this approach.
Furthermore, many studies found indications of char fragmenta-
tion for coal
[94,95,108,110,112(cid:1)114,117,168] and biomass
[119,120,122(cid:1)124].

2.3.2. Chemical transformations of inorganic constituents

Inorganic constituents in coal not only undergo physical
changes, such as melting, fusion or fragmentation, but also chemi-
cal transformation and decomposition. During heat up, part of the
inorganic constituents and mineral matter is released as a gaseous
species. The mass loss from mineral matter is due to the release of
water from clay minerals, carbon dioxide from carbonates, and sul-
fur from pyrite [57]. This, and the release of organically-bound
inorganics are challenges in predicting the ash composition. Gas
release is usually included in the proximate analysis leading to
erroneous results, especially for coals with a high ash content [57].
Not only the temperature treatment influences the decomposition
and chemical transformation. Gas atmosphere and its composition
can have a strong impact, in particular reducing environments.
These reducing zones lead to a changed chemical transformation of
some minerals. Crucial parameters are the availability of oxygen
and the particle temperature. Reducing zones are also found inside
burning char particles. Within regime II or III there is a depletion of
oxygen and thus reducing environments. Fig. 16 shows the trans-
formations of the main minerals found in coals, as a function of
temperature. Depending on the mineral type, a very different
behavior can be observed. Clay minerals, e.g. kaolinite or illite, are
often dominating in the mineral systems. The transformation of
kaolinite is well understood. Kaolinite loses water at around
425(cid:1)525 °C, forming metakaolinite, which then changes to mullite
and amorphous quartz, at around 900 °C [15]. The typical melting
point of this amorphous phase is around 1700 °C [178]. Illite is a
mineral containing most of the iron, magnesium, potassium and/or

sodium of all clays [15]. It is often present in large quantities and
with associations to other minerals, such as pyrite [178]. It also
starts to decompose at around 400 °C, forming an amorphous alu-
minosilicate. The melting point strongly depends on the composi-
tion. Typical values are around 1400 °C, however, the melting point
can be as low as 980 °C for certain eutectics in the K2O - Al2O3 -
SiO2 system [16,179]. Included illite is often reported to coalesce
and form low-temperature melts. Excluded illite does not show
fragmentation or swelling behavior. Quartz has a very high melting
point and is often reported to be inert. Quartz can be liberated dur-
ing milling and be present as an excluded particle. It can be embed-
ded in clay minerals or exist as a pure mineral [178]. Excluded
quartz particles do not melt at temperatures below 1600 °C leading
to sharp, erosive ash particles. Quartz is reported to start to volatil-
ize at temperatures around 1650 °C, or above. The behavior of
pyrite is rather difficult. Iron is often reported to be a key element
in deposit formation [15] and many research has focused on its
transformation [8,180,181]. Pure pyrite (Fe2S) starts to decompose
around 300 °C, releasing sulfur and forming pyrrhotite (Fe1(cid:1)xS),
which subsequently oxidizes in the presence of oxygen, to form
hematite or magnetite. Hematite and magnetite are again high melt-
ing minerals. There are two mechanisms reported in literature, one
involving the thermal decomposition and subsequent oxidation,
and, the second being a direct oxidation. Both are known to be slow
and therefore, kinetic investigations were carried out [182]. Couch
[15] mentions a low melting point for partially transformed pyrite.
Similar behavior was observed in reducing conditions, where eutec-
tics with melting points around 1220 °C, are reported [8]. Excluded
pyrite was studied in a drop tube furnace by Yan et al. [183] observ-
ing fragmentation, where each pyrite grain (50 mm) yielded around
four child particles. The authors successfully used the Poisson law,
similar to Eq. (2), in order to predict fragmentation behavior not
only for pyrite, but also for calcite.
Included pyrite can form
eutectics with even lower melting temperatures in the presence of
aluminosilicates. McLennan and others [8] report iron bearing
glass melts at temperatures as low as 1080 °C. Ten Brink et al. [181]

studied pyrite transformation in a real 2.5 MWth flame. They
observed a decomposition to molten FeS, which then oxidized to
solid iron oxide (Fe2O3 and Fe3O4). The kinetics of the decomposition
were estimated to proceed as fast as devolatilization, and the subse-
quent oxidation as fast as char conversion [181]. Carbonates are
known to decompose, and release carbon dioxide. Calcite (CaCO3)
for instance starts to loose CO2 at around 800 °C. Other carbonates
such as siderite (FeCO3) or dolomite (MgCO3CaCO3), start at roughly
500 °C and 750 °C, respectively [15,16]. Sulfates,
for example
gypsum, decompose earlier, and form stable anhydrite by the
release of water.

Chemical transformations and their complexity are discussed in
various references [16,82,178,184]. Process conditions, such as tem-
perature and oxygen content, can change the path of chemical trans-
formations, and lead to a variety of possible routes. Details of the
chemistry and mineral decomposition are poorly understood, in par-
ticular for particles containing a mixture of mineral inclusions.
When considering the melting temperatures shown in Fig. 16, most
values are above typical temperatures in combustion systems. How-
ever, ash deposition occurs already at much lower values, which is
probably due to interactions of mineral inclusions. Associated min-
erals are referred to as combinations of different mineral types in
one particle. These associated minerals and their compounds behave
differently, leading to eutectics and lowered melting points. In addi-
tion, minerals are often contaminated with other elements. There-
fore, modeling the fate of pure minerals is not able to capture real
processes. An overview of mineral transformations can be found, for
instance, in the work of Unsworth and others [82], Bryers [16], Bo(cid:3)zic̀
[184] or Magda [178]. The bar chart illustrated in Fig. 17, gives the
mineral composition of the Upper Freeport bituminous coal, before
and after combustion [57]. It shows the transformation of major
minerals, in particular the oxidation of pyrite to iron oxide, the for-
mation of glass phases and of amorphous silicates. Benson et al. [57]
discusses the vast variation of fly ash particles in size and chemical
composition. They further claim the dominance of amorphous
phases consisting mainly of silicate glass, summing up to 90 or more

wood, increased. Aerosols can be distinguished into organic and
inorganic particles. Organic particles such as soot, polycyclic aro-
matic hydrocarbons etc., can be caused by incomplete combustion,
typically for small-scale biomass boilers. Inorganic aerosols originate
from inorganic vapors and their condensation. A typical number and
mass distribution for wood combustion in a stove can be seen in
Fig. 18(a) and (b), respectively. Different operation conditions show
that aerosol concentration can be affected by process conditions
such as temperatures, oxygen concentration and distribution.
However, for large units such as PF boilers the variation and
potential is considerably smaller. Carroll et al. [47] showed for
small-scale applications that air staging can reduce particulate mat-
ter (PM1) emissions by 16 up to 26% in the case of wood combustion.
A much higher potential was reported when co-firing peat with
straw [46]. Up to 70% of aerosols were reduced caused by reactions
of gaseous alkali vapors with aluminosilicates found in peat - see
also Section 2.5.4. Damle et al. [139] collected data on aerosols
formed during coal combustion. Fig. 19 compares measured particle
concentrations within coal-fired boilers. The first mode typically
occurs around dp 1⁄4 100 nm with particle concentrations in the range
of 106(cid:1)108 per cm3. It is difficult to compare different studies, since
aerosol measurement devices differ, devices are highly complex, and
locations inside a boiler, boiler type as well as process conditions
highly affect results. Nevertheless, a qualitative estimate on typical
particle sizes and their distribution can be drawn from such a com-
parison. Fig. 20 shows a similar collection of data on the particle
number distribution in biomass fired systems. Particle numbers are
slightly higher compared with coal measurements and shifted
towards larger particle sizes with modes around dp 1⁄4 100(cid:1)300 nm.
This could be caused by an increased share of vaporizable inorganics
as shown in Fig 4. An increased amount of inorganic vapor leads to a
higher particle number, where a high particle concentration enhan-
ces particle coagulation and agglomeration. During this process, par-
ticles stick together, the particle number decreases, whereas the
mass remains constant. The quantity, form and concentration of
aerosols depends on the fuel, fuel preparation, firing system, but
also on process conditions, such as stoichiometry and temperature
[199]. Stoichiometry most likely affects organic aerosols produced
during incomplete or under-stoichiometric combustion. This is often
confirmed in small-scale wood fired grates [144]. Gas temperature
strongly affects the vaporization of inorganic elements in the fuel,
the supersaturation of inorganic vapors in the gas phase and thus,
the condensation and formation of aerosols. These phenomena will
be discussed within Section 2.5.3.

wt.%; where glass is defined as an inorganic product of fusion with-
out crystallizing upon cooling from a melt [57]. Physical properties
of ash particles, and their role during ash deposition, are discussed
in the following sections.

Studies dealing with chemical transformation of inorganics from
biomass are scarce. Arvelakis et al. [136,137] studied the effect of
leeching on ash behavior of straw and olive residue, as well as, con-
ducted simultaneous thermal analysis on high-alkali biomass ash.
Observed reactions and transformation included the release of CO2
from CaCO3, evaporation of KCl and reactions of K2CO3 with SiO2.
Bostr€om et al. [11] investigated minerals from woody biomass ashes
using XRD analysis. The authors identified empirical biomass ash
transformation phenomena in order to predict ash chemistry and
underlined the complexity due to a high number of species. In the
field of biomass ash formation, much attention was paid to inorganic
vaporization and re-condensation, however, studies dealing with
mineral inclusions and coarse fly ash formation are rare.

2.3.3. Flame-generated aerosols

Aerosols generated during solid fuel combustion and their char-
acteristics received much attention during the 70’s and 80’s in the
case of coal, and during the late 90’s in the case of biomass, when
the number of units firing lower-grade fuels, such as straw or waste-

Table 4 compares different publications dealing with aerosol
measurements in all three firing systems. Typical devices that are
applied are impactor cascades such as the Berner type low pressure
impactor (BLPI), similar compared to an ELPI, the differential mobil-
ity analyzer (DMA), the scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) or
the aerodynamic particle sizer (APS), where the latter two are typi-
cally applied in automotive industry. A detailed description and
these devices can be found in literature, e.g.
comparison of
[101,151,158,175,194]. An interesting high-temperature impactor
was presented by Brunner et al. [160], which enables studying aero-
sol formation at higher temperatures. All these devices are highly
complex and influenced by various parameters, such as dilution gas
in order to prevent agglomeration in the device, the ability of par-
ticles to carry electrical charge, particle shape and density, gas tem-
perature and thus gas viscosity and gas density, as well as many
more. Therefore, it is not surprising that measurement results scatter
significantly. A comparison of different studies should be only quali-
tatively. When evaluating Table 4, one can see that most studies
apply impactors in order to sample aerosols. The highest concentra-
tions of aerosols are found for waste-wood and straw. This can be
explained by the relatively high ash content and the fact, that these
fuels are rich in alkali metals shown in Table 1. Aerosol concentra-
tions for particles smaller than dp 1⁄4 1 mm, also referred to as PM1,

show values up to 1500 mg/m3
n as measured by Christensen et al.
[149] in a straw-fired grate. Mikkanen [161] showed that around
66% of fly ash can be found in aerosols with dp < 3 mm. For coals,
typically smaller numbers are reported, however, many different
values can be found in literature. The chemistry of aerosols strongly
depends on the parent fuel. Straw leads to aerosols rich in salts
mainly composed of KCl and K2SO4. Aerosols from wood combustion
are typically rich in K, Ca, Cl and Mg. On the contrary, bituminous
coals lead to S-, Ca- and Si-rich aerosols. As discussed previously, the
mode is typically around 100(cid:1)200 nm, and is dominated by agglom-
erates. The combustion system can influence aerosol formation,
however, there is no clear picture derived from Table 4.

Future studies should deal with the prediction of aerosol forma-
tion such as the work of Jokiniemi et al. [162]. There is a need for
guidelines on how to present, calculate and evaluate aerosol meas-
urements and emissions. Many studies do not provide all informa-
tion that is needed in order to evaluate and interpret their
measurement results. Further fundamental work has to be con-
ducted and should be coupled with comprehensive CFD models
enabling the prediction of ash deposition and hence, improve soot-
blowing or plant design. It is believed that aerosol behavior is of
great importance for slagging and fouling, in particular for biomass-
fired boilers.

2.4. Classification of fly ash particles

Ash particles and their behavior in combustion systems are
particularly challenging, since they can occur as liquid droplets
with Newtonian fluid flow behavior, as solid elastic particles, or
somewhere in between with a partially molten particle contain-
ing crystals. Ash particles can be classified based on their physi-
cal properties such as size, shape and geometry, as well as
based on their chemical composition and chemical structure.

Ash particle structures reported in combustion systems are
[97,186(cid:1)188]:

(cid:3) molten, perfectly spherical particles (typically from fusion of

low melting ash/mineral particles),

(cid:3) cenospherical particles with variable wall thickness (hollow

spheres),

(cid:3) plerospherical particles (hollow spheres filled with small often

sub-micron ash particles),

Fig. 21. Typical bituminous coal fly ash particles and their morphology (compiled from different references [97,185(cid:1)187]).

(cid:3) angular sharp particles (often reported for unmolten quartz),
(cid:3) loose,

irregular shaped and highly porous solids (mainly

reported for biomass, or unburnt char), and

(cid:3) agglomerations of small particles (often produced from included
mineral grains partially undergoing coalescence or by condensa-
tion and coagulation).

A graphical illustration of typical ash particles produced from
coal combustion is shown in Fig. 21. Spherical particles, as illustrated
in the top right corner, indicate that they have been molten in the
flame region. Raask [200] first explained the formation of ceno-
spheres (see middle right image). Coal particles with a high number
of included mineral grains form an ash layer around a reactive char
core. Fusion of this silicate envelope leaves burning carbon residue
inside, continuously releasing gases. If the remaining carbon con-
tains mineral grains, plerospheres, as shown in the center of Fig. 21,
are assumed to form. Agglomerates may form similarly, however
melting/fusion temperatures of ash or partially-transformed mineral
grains, does not occur. Sharp, unmolten particles are often found to
be composed of quartz or feldspars [15,97].

Typical ash particles produced by biomass combustion are
summarized in Fig. 22. At a first glimpse, one can see much more
irregular particles. Perfect spheres are rarely observed.
Instead
agglomerates (lower right corner) and irregular-shaped ash particles
or crystals are reported. Wood combustion leads to calcium-rich
particles with high fusion temperatures, as shown in the top left cor-
ner [101]. Straw (lower three images) forms similar particles, how-
ever, fusion is more often observed. Typically, small aerosol collide
with large ash particles, which can change the stickiness and thus
the deposition process. Characteristic salt-rich aerosol are shown in
the top-middle image. They can be angular, and have relatively low
melting temperatures.

Ash particle structures mainly depend on the raw fuel - size, form
and distribution of inorganics - and on the combustion system -
plant size, fuel size, grinding, temperatures, stoichiometry and com-
bustion intensity. The first point is often addressed in scientific stud-
ies. However, the impact of combustion system on fly ash particle
structures has never been studied systematically. It is known that
ashes from lab-scale flow reactors and full-scale boilers can differ
significantly. Different heating rates and flow velocities can change
particle structural development, char fragmentation, and thus, ash
formation [105]. However, there are studies, such as the work of Xu
et al. [192], reporting relatively good agreement between PSD of
ashes from lab- and full-scale. As expected, their data reveals that
full-scale systems have much higher particle concentrations [192].
In general, higher temperatures increase the probability of fusion/
coalescence of included mineral grains and enhance burnout. A coal
having high numbers of included mineral grains will form coarser fly
ash particles with spherical shape when burnt in a PF boiler, com-
pared with low-temperature laboratory ashes, where every mineral
grain will form one remaining ash particle, as long as char burnout is
identical and sintering does not occur. Char particles within ashes
are typically large (50 mm and larger) compared with fly ash par-
ticles [193,196]. A comparison of ashes from different combustion
systems such as grate, FB and PF using the same parent fuel is chal-
lenging. As shown in Fig. 1, grinding, and thus particle size differs
significantly, which then affects mineral liberation and residual ash
PSD. Furthermore, residence time and temperature profiles differ
significantly affecting the whole fly ash formation process. Ashes
from grate combustion are typically differentiated into fly ash and
bottom ash. In general, bottom ash are known to be significantly
larger. For instance, bottom ash particles in MSW combustion sys-
tems are in the size range of 0.5(cid:1)4 mm [197]. Fly ashes collected in
grate systems on the other hand are often reported to be rich in sub-
micron ash particles with peaks at around 0.2 up to 0.5 mm,

depending on the fuel and vaporization of inorganics [149,198]. Val-
mari et al. [189] studied fly ashes from willow combustion in a CFB
boiler and found a bi-modal size distribution with peaks at 0.2(cid:1)0.5
and 5(cid:1)10 mm, respectively. Some large, irregular and unmolten par-
ticles with 100 mm were found indicating incomplete coalescence
due to low temperatures [189]. In general, different combustion sys-
tems lead to changed fly ashes mainly caused by varying tempera-
ture profiles, residence times and parent fuels.

A classification based on chemistry is challenging. Within the
same fuel sample, a wide range of chemical compositions and struc-
tural variations among fly ash particles, are observed. Coal ashes
can produce glassy ash particles, particles containing crystals and
intermediates. Therefore, a classification based on chemistry is not
recommended. Instead CCSEM data can be a powerful tool, for deter-
mining the chemical composition and its variation. Care should be
taken, when categorizing ash particles to mineral or ash classes.
Instead a list of the raw elemental composition for each ash/mineral
particle, might be more useful.

In general, ash particles differ significantly in size, shape, struc-
ture and chemistry. This is even more pronounced in case of waste-
based fuels or biomass. Both, the shape and chemistry are known to
affect the sticking probability. Therefore, it is recommended to use
synthetic materials mimicking ash particles, in order to study stick-
ing and rebound behavior under well-defined and controlled condi-
tions. For instance, coal ashes can be simulated using soda-lime
glass particles [1,201], or biomass ashes with synthetic salt particles
[202,203].

2.5. Ash deposition mechanisms

Ash deposition strongly depends on the presence of ash particles
or inorganic vapors at heat exchanging surfaces. Deposition of par-
ticles involves particle transport to the wall, particle impaction, and
particle retention, often called particle sticking. Commonly it is dif-
ferentiated between particle impaction, sticking, and capture effi-
ciency, which are defined as [204,205]:

(cid:3) Impaction % 1⁄4

(cid:3) Sticking % 1⁄4

(cid:3) Capture % 1⁄4

Mass of particulate impacting surface
Total mass of particulate injected
Mass of particulate sticking surface
Mass of particulate impacting surface
Mass of particulate sticking to surface
Total mass of particulate injected

1⁄4 Impaction % ¢ Sticking %

In this definition, the total mass of particulate injected should be
calculated for the projected area in front of the obstacle, which is
typically a cylinder with diameter D [206]. The difference between
particle impaction and deposition rate are particles rebounding from
heat exchangers. The capture efficiency can be calculated as the
product of impaction and sticking efficiency. Physical phenomena
affecting the transport of particles and vapors in the flue gas are
summarized by Couch [15], who refers to an early study by Samms
and Watt [207]. These phenomena are particle drag due to the flow,

90

U. Kleinhans et al. / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 68 (2018) 65(cid:1)168

molecular and Brownian diffusion, thermal and eddy diffusion, as
well as gravity and electrostatic effects. Basically, each gradient in a
flow field can lead to particle movement, where small particles are
typically more prone to these gradients. This can be a gradient of
shear forces, the so-called Saffman lift force [208], a gradient in spe-
cies (referred to as diffusiophoresis) [209] or in turbulence (called
turbophoresis), where particles are transported in the direction of
lower turbulent kinetic energy [210]. The main transport mecha-
nisms leading to ash deposition on a surface are [211,212]:

(cid:3) inertial impaction including eddy impaction,
(cid:3) thermophoresis and diffusional aerosol transport due to gra-

dients in the flow,

(cid:3) diffusion of

inorganic vapors followed by heterogeneous
condensation and/or heterogeneous chemical reactions with
deposits.

The first two bullet points are related to particle deposition,
where inertial impaction is often reported as the dominant mecha-
nism of deposit formation, in terms of weight gain, and if a sticky ini-
tial layer is already existing. Heterogeneous condensation on the
wall and chemical reactions of inorganic vapors with the deposit

keep the surface concentrations of these gaseous species to zero. The
behavior of inorganic vapors is difficult to study. They can form sub-
micron particles during cooling within the boundary layer, which
are then transported by thermophoresis and other diffusional effects
to the surface. A graphical illustration of particle deposition mecha-
nisms on a tube is shown in Fig. 23 [213]. Inertial impaction, and
eddy impaction in a porous layer are dominating on the upstream
cylinder face. Eddy impaction together with thermophoresis are
dominating for small particles on both, the cylinder front and rear.
They are often reported to be the dominant mechanisms on the cyl-
inder rear. Thermophoresis, condensation and chemical reactions
are often mentioned, however, their role is unclear. Experiments on
particle deposition are mainly carried out in a vertical turbulent duct
flow. Fig. 24 shows the rate of particle deposition on the wall of a cir-
cular duct, as a function of non-dimensional variables. The dimen-
sionless deposition velocity Vdepþ is plotted as a function of the
dimensionless particle relaxation time tpþ. The dimensionless depo-
sition velocity is commonly defined as [214]:

less particle relaxation time, which can be viewed as the time scale
of the particle’s reaction to changes in the gas phase velocity. The
relaxation time is the time that a particle, initially traveling with

due to drag (friction) [215]. The particle relaxation time tp is calcu-

the review of Young and Leeming [214], with the original references
being Friedlander and Johnstone [217], Schwendiman and Postma
[218], Wells and Chamberlain [219], Sehmel [220], and the frequently
cited publication of Liu and Agarwal [221]. The deposition curve is
divided into three different deposition regimes. In the “diffusional
deposition regime” (typical for small particles), the deposition velocity
Vdepþ is decreasing with increasing tpþ. This regime is dependent on
the particle Schmidt number, Sc 1⁄4 ng=Dp; where Dp is the Brownian
particle diffusion coefficient. It is dependent on turbulent diffusion of
particles from the core of the duct and Brownian diffusion in a very
thin layer adjacent to the wall [214,216]. Brownian particle diffusion
is the random movement of particles due to collisions with molecules,
which becomes important for very small particles, typically in the
sub-micron region. Furthermore, it can dominate in laminar flows and
within laminar boundary layers. Particles diffuse from regions with
high particle concentrations to regions with lower values. This can be
interpreted analogously to gas molecular diffusion. The Brownian par-
ticle diffusion coefficient Dp can be estimated using the Einstein equa-
tion (see the work of Young and Leeming [214]). Thermophoresis is
caused by Brownian motion of particles. The difference between
Brownian motion and thermophoresis is that in the latter case, a tem-
perature gradient in the surrounding of the particle is present. This
temperature gradient can exhibit a directed force as introduced in the
upcoming Section 2.5.2. The intermediate regime is called “diffusional
regime”, where a strong increase of deposition velocity is observed.

Early publications inferred that this region is dominated by the inter-
action between particles having significant inertia, and the fluid tur-
bulent eddies [214]. The particle’s inertia in the near wall region is
large enough in order to cross the viscous sub-layer and deposit on
the wall. The third “inertia-moderated” regime is not influenced by
particle diffusion effects. Large particles having enough momentum
from large eddies in the turbulent core reach the wall directly. A slight
decrease in deposition rate with increasing particle size is observed.
This is explained by the fact that larger particles show less response to
turbulence [214]. Much effort has been devoted to the first two
regimes in order to derive equations, predicting the particle behavior.
However, only recently, advances are reported [216]. Particle deposi-
tion in a power plant is dependent on the wall type, e.g. tube or boiler
wall, and shows some differences compared to turbulent duct flow
experiments. In the following subsections each of the listed mecha-
nisms is described, recent advances are discussed, and differences to
vertical duct flow experiments are discussed.

2.5.1. Inertial impaction

Inertial impaction is often referred to as the dominant mecha-
nism, leading to accelerated deposit build-up, and producing the big-
gest weight gain in a deposit. It describes the effect that larger fly ash
particles (dp > 10 mm) cannot follow the streamlines around an
obstacle, and thereby impact due to their inertia. This behavior is
commonly expressed by the Stokes number, which is defined as the
ratio of the particle relaxation time tp, given by Eq. (6), to a charac-
teristic flow time scale tg:

where the characteristic flow time scale is calculated for a tube by
tg 1⁄4 D=2 ¢ u 1 ; with D being the outer tube diameter, and u1 being
the free-stream velocity. The flow time scale is the time that the
free-stream flow needs to pass the cylinder radius. Fig. 25 illustrates
the process of inertial impaction. The flow around a cylinder, with
its recirculation zone in the wake of the tube, is shown by blue
streamlines. Particles (black) approaching the cylinder cannot follow
the curvature of the streamlines due to their large mass, which
forces them to keep the current direction of the trajectory. Thus,
inertial forces exceed aerodynamic forces. Larger particles with high
inertia, and Stokes numbers of St > 1, barely respond to changes in
the fluid flow, as illustrated by the top particle trajectory in Fig. 25.
The particle impaction rate is highest for the front stagnation point
of the cylinder at Q 1⁄4 0 and decreases along the circumference. The
maximum impaction angle Qmax depends on the flow characteristics
around the cylinder, and the separation point of the flow. Particle
impaction on the cylinder rear side is also reported in literature, and
is caused by the recirculation zone, which again is a function of the
free-stream velocity u1. Often, the so-called impaction efficiency h
is used to describe the impaction probability of a particle approach-
ing a cylinder in the cross-flow. The impaction efficiency for the

Wessel and Righi [224] use the free-stream particle Reynolds num-

where np,D
Ximp is the number of particles impacting on the cylinder
front face and np,D
X1 is the number of particles in the projected area of
the cylinder further upstream [206]. Another method of determining
the impaction efficiency is by finding the outermost particle trajec-
tory still impacting on the cylinder, as given by the second part of
Eq. (9). Here, y0,D
Xmax is the maximum vertical distance from the cen-
terline, at which a particle will impact the cylinder surface; see the
lower particle track in Fig. 25. The impaction efficiency can be calcu-
lated by the vertical distance from the centerline to the starting
point of the particle y0,D
Xmax divided by the cylinder radius (D/2) [222].
Eq. (9) requires measurements or numerical simulations. A further
way of estimating the impaction efficiency is by using correlations
derived from potential flow calculations. These correlations are a
function of the particle’s Stokes number (h 1⁄4 f ðStÞ). Equations sug-
gested by Brun et al. [223] were extended to regions where the
Stokes’ law does not apply. The Stokes’ law describes the frictional
force (also called drag force) for a sphere within a low Reynolds
number flow. For small flow velocities the drag force is a linear func-
tion of the Reynolds number. At higher Reynolds numbers it deviates
from this linear function. Therefore, Israel and Rosner [215] intro-
duced a correction factor c, in order to calculate the so-called effec-
tive Stokes number Steff, accounting for this deviation:
Steff 1⁄4 St ¢ cðRepÞ;

ð10Þ

where the correction factor is a function of the particle Reynolds
number Rep. The correction factor can be calculated by Eq. (11). The
correction factor decreases from unity with an increasing particle
Reynolds number. The particle Reynolds number for typical ash par-
ticles is Rep < 1, which leads to a negligible influence of the correc-
tion factor c.

The valid range of Eqs. 13(a) and Eqs. 13(b), as well as the coeffi-
cients b1, b2 and b3 are given in Table 5. The impaction efficiency as
a function of the effective Stokes number is illustrated in Fig. 26(a).
Values shown are calculated using Eqs. (10) to 13(b). The flue gas
velocity is fixed to a value of u 1 1⁄4 10 m/s, and the gas density as
well as the dynamic viscosity, are computed for a gas temperature of
Tg 1⁄4 1000 °C, with data from the VDI heat atlas [225]. The correla-
tions given by Isreal and Rosner [215] and Wessel and Righi [224]
show similar behavior. Small particles with effective Stokes numbers
below Steff < 0.125 do not impact according to the correlations. With
increasing size, particles start to hit the surface and the impaction
efficiency is monotonically increasing, with an increasing Stokes
number. Particle impaction probability increases from around 8% for
a 12.5 mm particle to around 35%, when doubling the diameter. A
parametric study is conducted in Fig. 26(b). The impaction probabil-
ity increases with increasing particle size and density. Two examples
are shown for an aluminosilicate particle, with a density around
rp (cid:5) 2.5 g/cm3, and an iron-rich particle, e.g. hematite, with a density
around rp (cid:5) 5.5 g/cm3. It can be seen that particle density is along
with the particle diameter a critical parameter. Thus, both parame-
ters are crucial and an ash formation model needs to be able to pre-
dict both, in particular the particle size, since the Stokes number is a
quadratic function of the particle diameter. The correlations given

are derived for in-viscous (potential) flow calculations and boundary
layer effects are disregarded. It has been shown by Haugen and Krag-
set [226] that the cylinder Reynolds number Recyl influences the cap-
ture efficiency curve, since it changes the boundary layer thickness
for a viscous flow. An increased cylinder Reynolds number (calcu-
¢ D ¢u 1 =mg) shifts the impaction curve of Fig. 26(a)
lated by Recyl 1⁄4rg
slightly to the left.

Particle impaction rates for small Stokes numbers cannot be pre-
dicted by potential flow calculations since boundary layer effects
dominate this impaction process. Particles with St < 0.1, follow the
streamlines around the cylinder almost perfectly. The impaction of
these particles is solely due to their dimension. The particle center
does not reach the surface, only the finite size of the particles leads
to a contact between the cylinder surface and the particle surface.
The small window in Fig. 25 illustrates this mechanisms. This effect
is referred to as “interception” or “boundary layer interception”.
Typically, this effect can be calculated by viscous flow calculations
using CFD (see e.g. Haugen and Kragset [226]). The role of this effect
on slagging and fouling, however, might be small, due to the small
mass of these particles, and low impaction probabilities.

Compared with the vertical duct flow experiment, a cylinder
exhibits an external flow with laminar boundary layers, and a transi-
tion flow with turbulent structures approaching the cylinder. To
sum up, inertial impaction is often referred to as the dominant
mechanism leading to extensive deposition, when particles adhere
to the surface. It is most pronounced for larger particles, as shown
in Figs. 26(a) and (b).

2.5.2. Thermophoresis

Thermophoresis describes a force on particles in a flow with a
non-uniform temperature field. This force is acting in the opposite
direction of the temperature gradient, i.e. from the hot gas towards
the cold gas. The force becomes relevant for smaller particles, how-
ever, it is still not completely understood [227]. Thermophoresis is
often mentioned to be important, but rarely addressed in a scientific
way for slagging and fouling in a PF system. Another difficulty is the
potential of particle nucleation within the boundary layer, which
makes it very difficult to actually quantify thermophoresis. The main
reason is due to the complexity of this effect. It is difficult to isolate
the thermophoretic force in a deposition experiment, and it is even
more complex to measure small thermophoretic forces, which are in
the range of 10(cid:1)9(cid:1)10(cid:1)15 N. The effect was first described by Tyndall
[228] in the late 19th century, who observed the formation of a
dust-free zone near a heated surface (see also the review of Young
[227]). Small dust particles immersed in the flow could not reach the
surface due to the thermophoretic force acting from the hot to the
cold gas. There are several studies, such as Cawood [229], Walker
et al. [230] or Cameron and Georg-Wood [231], indicating the domi-
nant role of thermophoresis for the deposition of particles in the

diameter range of 0.1 < dp < 10 mm. G€okoGlu and Rosner [232]
showed that the impaction rate increases by a factor of 1000 for a
1 mm particle, when the wall temperature is set to a value of 20%
below the free-stream temperature. Fig. 27 illustrates the force on
particles in the boundary layer of a superheater tube. Thermophore-
sis (TP) can be explained by varying bombardment of gas molecules
on a particle surface. Gas molecules are carrying a higher kinetic
energy on the hot side of a particle compared to the cold side. The
higher kinetic energy of collisions between molecules and the hot
particle surface leads to a net force on the particle in the direction of
the cold flow. The mean gas molecule velocity vM; can be derived
from the Maxwell(cid:1)Boltzmann equation:

where rTg is the temperature gradient in the gas phase at the posi-

tion of the particle, if there is no particle present, and F 1⁄4 f Kn; L
is the thermophoretic coefficient. This coefficient is a function of
the Knudsen number Kn, and the ratio of the particle and gas ther-
mal conductivity L 1⁄4 kp=kg (note that definitions differ in litera-
ture). The gas thermal conductivity is the translatoric part of the
thermal conductivity expressed by kg 1⁄4 15=4¢mg
¢Rs; where Rs is the
specific gas constant. The gas properties in Eq. (15) are also calcu-
lated for the center of the particle, if there would be no particle.
The Knudsen number Kn, is defined as the ratio of the mean free
path length λ of the fluid to the particle radius, according to the
following equation:

Kn 1⁄4

ð16Þ

The Knudsen number is used to judge, whether the flow characteris-
tics can be described by continuum mechanics (for Kn < 1), or, by
methods of statistical mechanics (for Kn > 1). For small particles
(dp < 5 mm) in a PF boiler, the Knudsen number can exceed values of
Kn > 1 depending on the gas temperature. In this case, the classical
Stokes drag has to be corrected (see e.g. [226]). The mean path
length λ, can be calculated by:

where p is the pressure in Pa, and the gas viscosity mg being a func-
tion of the gas temperature Tg. With an increasing gas temperature,
the mean free path length increases leading to an increased Knudsen
number. At ambient temperature, air has a mean free path length
of λ 1⁄4 65 nm. This value increases for a furnace temperature of
Tg 1⁄4 1200 °C to λ 1⁄4 450 nm. At that temperature a particle with
dp (cid:5) 0.9 mm reaches the critical Knudsen number of Kn 1⁄4 1; requir-
ing extra laws for particle drag. Many studies have focused on the
formulation of a generally valid expression for F, given in Eq. (15)
[227]. Most studies use experimental values to derive correlations.
However, different results are reported in the transition region
between slip-flow (Kn (cid:5) 0.1) and free-molecule regime (Kn (cid:6) 1). In
this region, the thermal conductivity ratio has a strong impact on
the thermophoretic force Fth. Epstein [234] recognized the depen-
dence of the thermophoretic force on the thermal conductivity ratio
in the slip-flow region, and proposed the following equation for low
Knudsen numbers Kn (cid:7) 1:

F 1⁄4

ð18Þ

where Ktc is the thermal creep coefficient. Maxwell, who first postu-
lated the theory of gaseous thermal creep, derived Ktc 1⁄4 0:75 from
simple kinetic theory calculations [227,235]. Recent work suggests
values in the range of 1.02 < Ktc < 1.18 [227]. The negative sign in
Eq. (18) indicates the direction of TP, which accelerates particles in
the opposite direction of the temperature gradient. Waldmann [236]
suggested a correlation for the region of free molecular flow at
Kn (cid:6) 1:

F is solely a function of the Knudsen number, and is not influenced
by particle properties. A widely used theory is based on the work of
Talbot et al. [237], who modified correlations originally proposed by
Brock [238]:

The velocity slip and temperature jump coefficients Cm and Ce,

Brock [238] suggested values of Am 1⁄4 1:0 and Ae 1⁄4 15=8 1⁄4 1:875.
Talbot et al. [237] used values of Am 1⁄4 1:14; Ae 1⁄4 2:18; and Ktc 1⁄4
1:17; which are similar to the ones proposed by Beresnev and Cher-
nyak [239]: Am 1⁄4 1:137 and Ae 1⁄4 2:178. The accommodation coeffi-
cients am and ae describe the interaction of incident gas molecules
with the particle surface, and are often set to am 1⁄4 ae 1⁄4 1 [233,239].

Eq. (23) again uses look-up tables for the coefficients AW, AO, HW, and
HO [240]. Since look-up tables are impracticable and their applica-
tion is elaborate, simpler correlations, such as the one proposed by

Talbot et al. [237], are often preferred for modeling purposes. A
recent correlation of F has been proposed by Young [227], reassess-
ing available measurements, without the need of look-up tables:

Young suggests a value of Cint 1⁄4 0:5; for the interpolation constant.
The correlation provides similar results as the one suggested by
Beresnev and Chernyak [239], and is considered to be more accurate.
Strictly it is only valid for Kn < 0.2, however, Young [227] suggests
an application for the whole Kn-range. A comparison of different cor-
relations for F is shown in Fig. 28. At Kn ! 0 all model curves are
consistent with Eq. (18), suggested by Epstein [234]. The same
behavior can be observed for large Knudsen numbers (Kn ! 1),
where they approach Eq. (19), suggested by Waldmann [236]. In the
region 0.001 < Kn < 1, models show large differences. In particular,
the frequently cited equation proposed by Talbot et al. [237] differs
considerably to equations suggested by Beresnev and Chernyak
[239], and the model by Young [227]. The latter two show consider-
ably lower values at the same L, indicating a decrease in thermo-
phoretic force. At very high thermal conductivity ratios (L 1⁄4 1000)
the so-called “reversed thermophoresis” is predicted. This force
from cold to hot was first postulated by Dwyer [241], who did theo-
retical calculations on the Boltzmann equations [227]. It is often also
referred to as “thermal stress slip flow” or “second mechanism of
thermophoresis”. However, experimental evidence is still due [227].
This phenomenon can be seen in Fig. 28 when (cid:1)F=2p yields nega-
tive values. At a low value of L 1⁄4 1; the thermophoretic coefficient
shows its highest values. The values decrease with decreasing par-
ticles size, but relative to the particle mass, thermophoresis becomes
more important at lower values of dp. Typical thermal conductivity
ratios for a PF boiler are in the range of 3 < L < 100, where both, the
gas kg, and the particle thermal conductivity kp, are dependent
on temperature and chemical composition. Rezaei et al. [246]
gives values for the thermal conductivity of coal ashes in the range
of kp 1⁄4 0:3 (cid:1) 4 Wm(cid:1)1K(cid:1)1. They further assume higher values for
iron-rich ashes. The gas thermal conductivity is typically in the range
of kg 1⁄4 0:04 (cid:1) 0:1 Wm(cid:1)1K(cid:1)1; where values are taken from the VDI
heat atlas, and calculated for typical flue gas compositions [225].

The measurement of thermophoresis is a challenging task due to
the small magnitude of this force. Early observations, such as the
one reported by Tyndall [228], are strongly influenced by convection
of the surrounding fluid. Later experiments focused on single parti-
cle studies, in a so-called Millikan cell. This enables the exact mea-
surement of the particle diameter. Charged liquid droplets are held
in an electric field between two electrodes, with the field strength E;
see also [247(cid:1)249]. By differential heating of the electrodes, one can
establish the following equilibrium e ¢ E 1⁄4 mp ¢ g þ Fth
; in which e is
the elementary charge, mp is the mass of the particle, and g is the
acceleration due to gravity. This equation can be used to calculate
the thermophoretic force by knowing the particle mass, which
requires an exact determination of the particle size. This enables a
direct measurement of the thermophoretic force on droplets or par-
ticles in a controlled environment. By changing the carrier gas and
its pressure or the particle composition, the value L can be studied
at different Kn numbers.

Studies on the role of thermophoresis in combustion systems are
rare. An interesting experimental and modeling study with direct
relevance and link to slagging and fouling, was presented by Zhan
et al. [242]. They used a vertical surface in a 100 kW down-flow labo-
ratory coal combustor in order to study the inner deposit layer for-
mation and the role of thermophoresis within laminar flow. The
authors introduced a thermophoresis number Tp being the ratio of
the time a particle travels along a cold surface with thermophoresis

and the time a particle would require without thermophoresis by
considering only drag. If Tp < 1 particles are captured on the surface.
By using this relationship, the authors could show reasonable agree-
ment with measurements. Ash deposition rates increased linearly as
the temperature difference between gas and surface increased.
Future work will include thermophoresis in CFD codes and validate
experiments.

A study [243] predicting the capture efficiency on a cylinder in
the cross-flow with and without thermophoresis showed that the
capture efficiency for particles with small Stoke numbers increased
by three to four orders of magnitude depending on the thermopho-
resis model and the particle size. Two different models, i.e. Talbot
et al. [237] and Young [227], were compared, where the latter one
showed a decreased impaction efficiency. Furthermore,
it was
explained why small aluminosilicates particles experience a higher
thermophoretic force compared with iron-rich particles. This is due
to an increased thermal conductivity ratio L for iron-rich particles
[243]. Lutro [245] conducted a similar study at lower cylinder Rey-
nolds numbers and found similar results for a non-isothermal case.

Beckmann et al. [397] evaluated the influence of thermophoresis
on the overall deposition rate using an isothermal plug flow reactor
and a comprehensive and detailed CFD model. The CFD model
included the effect of thermophoresis by using the model of Talbot
et al. [237]. Predicted ash arrival rate on a cooled probe increased
depending on the port in the test rig between 7 and 50%. The authors
underline the important effect of temperature and the need for an
accurate sticking criterion. A similar study was presented recently
by Yang et al. [304], who used 2D CFD simulations in order to predict
the deposit growth including thermophoresis using again the Talbot
model. During early stages, thermophoresis increased the impaction
efficiency from 0.02 to around 0.03. This effect diminished with
increasing probe surface temperature and time. The authors found
that ash deposition is dictated by inertial impaction and the sticki-
ness of particles [304].

A different conclusion concerning thermophoresis was presented
by Sinquefield [244]. He studied the role of different deposition
mechanisms using the Multifuel Combustor at Sandia National Labo-
recovery boilers were
ratories. Conditions

from black liquor

mimicked using sub-micron and micrometer-sized particles together
with a dynamic monitoring system for deposit growth rates. Results
showed a linear deposit growth accompanied by a highly non-linear
temperature increase, ruling out thermophoresis since temperature
difference became smaller once the layer thickness increased. Sin-
quefield [244] showed that the rate remained constant even though
the temperature difference dropped significantly, concluding that
thermophoresis is not the rate-controlling mechanism. However, as
the initial probe temperature was varied, deposition rate changed,
indicating some sort of thermal effect. The author instead postulates
an inertially-dependent mechanisms based on deposit morphology.
Morphology of sub-micron deposits are dendritic with over 90% voi-
dage. Particles are found to have a high sticking efficiency and do not
roll or settle subsequent to impaction in the porous structure [244].

Thermophoresis is a temperature-driven effect, whose relevance
during slagging and fouling is not clear yet. At early stages of deposit
build-up, it may play an important role, however, detailed validation
studies using CFD in order to explain experimental observations are
rare in literature. Additionally, the effect of deposit structure is often
neglected, mainly due to its complexity. Furthermore, uncertainty
due to different correlations is high.

2.5.3. Condensation

The condensation of inorganic vapors occurs during cooling,
when the flue gas is supersaturated and gas temperature falls
beneath the vapor dew point. A fluid is saturated when the vapor
pressure of the condensing species equals the saturation pressure of
the same species. Condensation on a surface (fly ash particle or heat
exchanger) is referred to as heterogeneous condensation. A direct
particle formation in the gas-phase is called homogeneous nucle-
ation; see also the work of Wieland [174]. In the case of a clean tube,
condensation leads to the formation of a thin, sticky film, which
might change the pick-up of other solids [15]. Further condensation
effects can occur on fly ash particles or on existing deposits. The
amount and chemical composition of inorganic vapors strongly
depends on flue gas temperatures, and the fuel itself. In the super-
heater region with gas temperature around 800(cid:1)1200 °C, these inor-
ganic vapors are primarily compounds of alkali metals [15,102,212]:

forms at

inorganic vapors

The vapors listed above are predominantly formed by chemical
reactions in the gas phase [212], and depend on the vaporization
and release of inorganics in the fuel as discussed by Fig. 4, which
gives estimates on elements, which can be vaporized and their
quantity. Fig. 29(a) shows the inorganic element vaporization frac-
tion per unit burnout time for a Montana lignite. This study was
conducted by Mims et al. [250] and shows that only a small amount
of
combustion temperatures of
1300(cid:1)1500 °C. The fraction vaporized xi divided by the burnout time
tb is shown as a function of temperature [70]. At T 1⁄4 2000 K, the
value xi/tb yields 5 for Na, implying that around 10% of the sodium in
the lignite will vaporize during a burnout time of tb 1⁄4 2 s. The
amount might be even lower for higher-rank coals [57]. On the other
hand, condensation is important for fuels with high alkali metal con-
tents, such as biomass. Dayton et al. [251] used a high-temperature
reactor coupled with a mass spectrometer, in order to study the
release of alkali and chlorine species during switchgrass combustion.
Their findings suggest that potassium release mainly occurs during
char conversion, with a slight overlap with devolatilization. Chlorine
is released as HCl during devolatilization. Adding steam reduced the
amount of KCl, and increased the release of KOH [251]. Heteroge-
neous condensation requires the presence of inorganic vapors at the
heat exchanging surface. For typical clean superheater tubes, the
flow around the cylinder is in the range of Reynolds number of
500(cid:1)5000. At these numbers, the boundary layer is laminar, and
vapor transport is driven by Ficks’ first law of diffusion:
jA 1⁄4 (cid:1)DAB r cA;
ð25Þ
where jA is the diffusive flux in mol/(m2 s), DAB is the molecular diffu-
sion coefficient of species “A” in species “B”, and rcA is the concen-
tration gradient in all spatial directions (e.g. @cA/@x). A correlation for

where bA is the mass transfer coefficient, pA the partial pressure,
psat,A is the saturation pressure (or vapor pressure) of species “A”,
and p the total pressure. The mass transfer coefficient b, often also
defined as k, can be calculated by the following expression:
bA 1⁄4 Sh ¢ DAB

where Sh is the Sherwood number being a function of the Reynolds
number (Re) and Schmidt number (Sc). The parameter D, is the diam-
eter of a heat exchanger tube. An empirical correlation for the
Sherwood number of a tube in a cross-flow, is given by:
Þ0:2;

Sh 1⁄4 c ¢ Rem ¢ Scn ¢ Sc=ScW
ð28Þ
where the coefficients c, m and n are dependent on the flow charac-
teristics, and thus on the Reynolds number. Analogous equation for
a spherical ash particle can be found in the literature (see Baehr and
Stephan [254]). The last term in Eq. (28) is a correction for differen-
ces in the Schmidt number of the free-stream Sc and of the wall ScW,
where the Schmidt number is defined as the ratio of momentum- to

mass-transport: Sc 1⁄4 ng=DAB 1⁄4 mg
quantity is the saturation pressure psat,A, e.g. needed in Eq. (26). It is
a function of gas temperature and concentration of species “A”. Typi-
cally, it is calculated using the Antoine equation:

where A, B, and C are fitting coefficients, and T is the temperature
in °C (e.g. given in [212,255]). Another option for the calculation of
the saturation pressure is by using thermodynamic equilibrium cal-
culations. A useful number for the estimation of condensation is
the supersaturation ratio SA of the gas phase with species “A”. It

can be predicted by the following expression:

ð30Þ

At high supersaturation ratios SA (cid:6) 1, homogenous condensation is
likely to occur, whereas at SA 1⁄4 1 the system is in equilibrium, as it is
shown in Fig. 29(b). Homogeneous condensation (particle nucle-
ation) starts at a gas temperature of Tg 1⁄4 1000 °C and SA > 5 for alkali
species [171,172,174]. Thus, ash deposition due to heterogeneous
condensation is expected to play a key role in the range of 1 < SA < 5
[212]. Fig. 29(b) shows, that depending on the vapor concentration,
K2SO4 starts to condensate at relatively high temperatures of
950(cid:1)1200 °C. Thus, it will most likely occur on fly ash particles in
the superheater region or within boundary layers of heat exchang-
ers. Alkali chlorides (KCl) supersaturate at lower temperatures and
hence, they are likely to condense directly on the tube. Experimental
studies on inorganic vapor deposition on surfaces are reviewed in
the work of Haselsteiner [256]. There are only few studies present
dealing with heterogeneous condensation such as the one by Nielsen
et al. [257], Akbar et al. [258], Lindberg et al. [203] or Yang et al.
[304]. An important characteristic is the metal vapor dew point.
Below this point, condensation effects, e.g. of inorganic vapors in the
boundary layer of a tube, lead to sub-micron particles enhancing
deposit built-up. Is an inorganic vapor above its dew point, chemical
reactions can take place, either with other gases or with solids, e.g.
ash particles or deposits. These reactions can then change the melt-
ing temperature or lead to a sticky surface, enhancing again ash
deposition rates.

2.5.4. Chemical reactions

Heterogeneous chemical reactions can occur between gas phase
species and deposited mass or ash particles. Often alkali metal
vapors are dominating inorganic reactions, e.g. on particles or boiler
walls. Couch [15] states that chemical reactions can determine
whether a particles sticks and deposit starts to grow. The most
important chemical reactions reported in literature are [15,259]:

(cid:3) formation of low temperature eutectics from the interaction of

Fe, Na, Ca, Al, and Si,

(cid:3) sulfation,
(cid:3) alkali absorption,
(cid:3) carbonation, and
(cid:3) oxidation or reduction.

Strictly, the first point is not a chemical reaction, however, it is
strongly influenced by reaction and diffusion processes. Sulfation
typically occurs for compounds of Na and K, Ca, Mg or Zn with reac-
tions being:

2MCl þ SO3 þ H2OÐM2SO4 þ 2HCl

ð31Þ

2MCl þ SO3 þ 1=2O2ÐM2SO4 þ Cl2
ð32Þ
In Eqs. (31) and (32) “M” stands for instance for alkali metals Na or K.
Both reactions can also proceed with SO2, instead of SO3. However,
sulfation is reported to be orders of magnitude faster with SO3 [260].
Both reactions can either occur as a gas phase reaction, or as gas-
solid reaction [257]. Furthermore, Eqs. (31) and (32) release chlorine
species, which can then attack the metal surface and lead to corro-
sion, dependent on the metal temperature [175]. The chemical
absorption of alkali species in the deposit is mainly attributed to alu-
minosilicates (such as kaolinite), and their ability to absorb alkali
sulphates, or, alkali chlorides [48,49,261,262]:
Al2O3 ¢2SiO2 þM2SO4 þ2H2O ! M2O ¢Al2O3 ¢2SiO2 þSO3 þ2H2O

ð33Þ

Al2O3 ¢2SiO2 þ2MClþ2H2O ! M2O ¢Al2O3 ¢2SiO2 þ2HClþH2O

ð34Þ

This absorption process leads to a formation of low-melting silicates.
The transformations can include sintering and strongly affect physi-
cal properties of the deposit, depending on the temperature [15].
The reaction rate is slow for the absorption process, compared with
sulfation. However, the absorption of alkali metal vapors above their
dew point and at high temperatures, where condensation cannot
occur, is known to be fasterD
X, in particular when aluminosilicates are
molten. Lindner and Wall [263] claimed that sodium silicate forma-
tion is significantly higher in the case when NaOH reacts instead of
NaCl. The reaction path is accordingly:
2MClþ2H2O ! 2MOHþ2HCl

ð35Þ

Al2O3 ¢2SiO2 þ2MOH ! M2O ¢Al2O3 ¢2SiO2 þH2O

ð36Þ

Hydroxides are mainly stable at high temperatures and in systems
with low concentrations of sulfur, e.g. when firing biomass. At
lower temperatures, chlorides become stable, and even further
down the temperature axis carbonates may show up. It is easier to
capture hydroxides since their chemistry fits better into the alu-
mina-silicate 3D structure, compared with relatively large chloride
molecules. Sulfur has the effect to rise the dew point by forming
sulfates that condense [49]. It is concluded that sulfur lowers the
time available for reaction between alkali vapors and aluminosili-
cates, and consequently, the amount of alkali metals scavenged
[48]. Fagerstr€om et al. [46] showed that the number of aerosols in
the range of 0.05(cid:1)1 mm is reduced by more than 70% when co-fir-
ing peat with straw. In particular the amount of alkali chlorides
decreases leading to less corrosive deposits. High temperatures in
the flame can have two effects. On the one hand, vaporization rates
increase leading to a higher concentration of inorganic vapors. On
the other hand, the absorption of alkali metals in aluminosilicates
is much faster at higher temperatures, and thus, it can lead to a
decrease in aerosol concentration. Another aspect of chemical reac-
tions is the deposition of unburnt carbon. Typically, this value is
below 2 wt.% in fouled deposits, and no unburnt carbon is found in
slagging deposits [15]. Unburnt carbon can lead to further reactions
and reducing conditions, accompanied with heat and gas release
inside deposits. All chemical reactions are a function of tempera-
ture, which can vary strongly within deposits as shown later on in
Fig. 32.

2.5.5. Further transport mechanisms

There are further transport mechanisms reported in the literature
with mostly unknown relevance for slagging and fouling. These
mechanisms lead to forces on fly ash particles, change the impaction
efficiency, and can therefore influence the deposition process. An
often mentioned but rarely addressed transport mechanism is the
so-called “eddy impaction”. Turbulent eddies in the vicinity of heat
exchanging surfaces can accelerate small particles, which are then
able to leave the eddy due to their inertia and penetrate the bound-
ary layer. This effect might be important for the wake of a super-
heater tube (lee side of the cylinder), however, it is only relevant for
smaller particles. A further force on particles is induced by “Brow-
nian motion” of molecules affecting the movement of, again, only
small particles. Saffman [208] proposed a force induced by shear
stresses. It is often referred to as the Saffman lift force and should be
included in regions with high shear stresses such as in the vicinity of
walls. This force can enhance the deposition velocity of particles,
and for deposition calculation a modified expression should be used
including effects of the proximity of a wall [216]. The sign of the Saff-
man lift force depends on the direction of the slip velocity perpen-
dicular to the wall.

Electrophoresis is a force on dispersed particles in an electric
field. The force is given by FEl 1⁄4 q ¢ E; where q stands for the total
charge of a particle. In addition, in the presence of a charged wall,
particles can experience an electrostatic force [216]. Guha [216]

uses the parameter ξ to relate the charge of a particle qp to the maxi-
mum possible charge qp,max (qp 1⁄4 ξ ¢ qp;max). Since a furnace has no
significant electric fields, this is only of importance for electrostatic
precipitators.

Guha [216] further calculates the impact of different effects on
the dimensionless deposition velocity, given in Eq. (5). The main
influences affecting the particle impaction are:

(cid:3) a temperature gradient in the boundary layer rT, referred to as

thermophoresis,

(cid:3) the surface roughness of the substrate kþ
s
(cid:3) an electrical charge of particles ξ referred to as electrophoresis.

; and

Guha [216], solves a particle continuity equation for a fully devel-
oped flow in a turbulent duct in order to study the impact of each
mentioned effect. Fig. 30 shows the results of his studies. A detailed
description of the approach can be found in his works [216,264]. It
can be concluded that all three effects have a considerable influence
for small particle relaxation times, and thus, small particles. Increas-
; leads to a strong increase in the
ing the surface roughness height kþ
s
dimensionless deposition velocity (Fig. 30(a)). The value increases by
up to three orders of magnitude leading to deposits of fine particles.
This is a crucial parameter since a clean and smooth superheater tube
only exists at the commissioning of a power plant. After a short period
of operation, surfaces collect small particles due to thermophoresis or
form dentritic structures. The
heterogeneous condensation, and,
impact of different electrical charges ξ of particles is shown in Fig. 30
(b). The deposition velocity is again increased, but not as pronounced
as by the surface roughness. The maximum electrical charge ξ 1⁄4 1
leads to an increase in dimensionless deposition velocity of one up to
two orders of magnitude for small particles. The effect of temperature
difference between the gas and the wall is shown in Fig. 30(c). A simi-
lar effect compared to the surface roughness can be observed. A slight
temperature increase of DT 1⁄4 5 K leads to a 25 times higher deposi-
tion velocity due to thermophoresis (see Section 2.5.2).

2.5.6. Mechanisms removing deposits

Besides mechanisms leading to deposit

formation, deposit
removal is a phenomenon which is often observed. The main mecha-
nisms leading to removal, according to a review of Zbogar et al.
[265], are:

(cid:3) shedding of deposits due to thermal shock, mechanical stresses

or gravity,

(cid:3) erosion caused by sharp, angular, unmolten particles, or
(cid:3) melting and drip off.

Shedding of deposits can be caused by various mechanisms such
as gravity, thermally- or mechanically-induced tensions. Thermal
tension can be the result of combustion fluctuations, load changes
or soot blowing. Mechanically-induced tensions are typically due to
soot blowing or mechanical fluctuations, such as vibrations
[265,266]. Soot blowers and water cannons use pressurized steam
or water and spray it on heat exchanging surfaces in order to cause
stresses in the deposit and clean the boiler wall. Fig. 31 shows the
effect of soot blowing on steam generation. However, the efficiency
of soot blowing strongly depends on the deposit structure,
its
chemistry, age and location in the boiler. A classification of deposits
and the influence of removal mechanisms on deposit types is given
in Table 6. Erosion is the process when sharp unmolten particles
collide with non-sticky areas on a deposit surface [265]. Typically,
in coal-fired boilers, these are quartz particles with relatively high
melting points. Erosion, as a gradual removal of material, can be
divided into deformation and cutting actions. Deformation is rele-
vant for brittle materials and caused by the normal velocity compo-
nent of incoming particles, whereas cutting actions are related to
the tangential velocity component, and most relevant for ductile
surfaces. Raask [12] differentiates between erosion of abrasive,
hard, and angular quartz particles, which cause erosion by cutting,
and glass particles leading to surface deformation and brittle fail-
ure. Main parameters influencing erosion are particle hardness,
shape, diameter, impact velocity, and angle of impaction. Table 6
shows that erosion is dominant for the removal of dry, powdery
deposits, whereas molten slags are not affected by erosion effects.
Gravity shedding is caused by gravitational forces due to the
deposit weight, which lead to a break down and/or fracture in
the structure [265]. The gravitational force can exceed forces in the
bonding of the deposit, or the interface of deposit and steel surface.
Large deposits are reported to fall into the ash hopper, causing
damage to the tubes. This effect is most relevant for powdery or
lightly sintered deposits. Gravity is also causing the removal of mol-
ten slags. A thermal shock leads to fracture due to different thermal
expansion coefficients of the deposit and the tube material. A sud-
den shrinkage caused by cooling (e.g. by soot blowing) leads to
thermal stresses and failure inside the deposit [265]. This mecha-
nism is more pronounced for sintered deposits, with higher thermal
conductivities and lowered porosity values. Removal mechanisms
are manifold and dependent on many characteristics, such as
deposit strength and structure, cleaning devices inside the boiler,
chemical composition and particle characteristics. It is therefore
not surprising that modeling of deposit removal is challenging and
rare in literature.

2.6. Deposit growth and effects on heat transfer

Deposit formation is strongly dependent on process conditions
inside the boiler and fly ash characteristics, i.e. chemical composition
and size distribution, as discussed in the previous section. Main pro-
cess parameters influencing the extent of slagging (superheater
region with molten or partially molten ash particles) and fouling
(low temperature region such as economizer with lower flue gas
velocities and solid ash particles) are the flue gas temperature, veloc-
ity, and composition (reducing or oxidizing environment). Slagged or
fouled heat exchanging surfaces lower the heat transfer rate to the
water-steam cycle and thus reduce the boiler efficiency and signifi-
cantly affect the operability. Van Beek et al. [267,268] reported a
reduced heat transfer coefficient of 25%, due to the formation of a
powdery deposit in the economizer region (fouling layer). In this
region, ash particle are solidified due to lowered temperatures;
flue gas temperatures are typically between 400 and 600 °C, and
steel tube temperatures around 300 °C. During early stages of
deposit formation (clean tube), only sub-micron particles can
deposit, since their velocity is low enough. Large particles will
rebound and possible erode loosely-bound particles [268]. This is
confirmed by study of Steadman et al. [269], who observed a
thin 10-100 mm thick layer, composed of sub-micron particles.

reported to deposit and stick [268,270].

The main reason for deteriorated heat transfer is the low thermal
conductivity of ash deposits. A deposit layer has a relatively low
thermal conductivity (0.2 < kdeposit < 3 Wm¡1K¡1D
X), compared to steel

tubes (15 < ksteel < 57 Wm¡1K¡1), leading to a deteriorated heat
transfer from the flue gas to the water-steam cycle. The thermal con-
ductivity of steel depends on its composition. Austenitic steels (such
as X8CrNiNb1613) show values around 15 Wm¡1K¡1, whereas fer-
ritic steels (such as 10CrMo9) have higher values of 35 Wm¡1K¡1 at
ambient temperature [271]. Wynnyckyj et al. [272] developed an
integrated monitoring system in order to determine boiler perfor-
mance and a cleaning strategy for heating surfaces by sootblowers.
They applied a combination of thermocouples, heat flux meters
and pyrometers. A furnace in Saskatchewan, Canada was used to
install “dirty” and “clean” heat flux meters directly on the boiler
wall. The clean heat flux meters were protected from slagging by
purging air, whereas dirty ones were exposed to ash accumulation.
Results for heat transfer over time are shown in Fig. 31. This figure
clearly reveals a reduced heat transfer when an ash layer builds up.
It shows that selective soot-blowing can increase heat transfer
rates. This kind of monitoring system is often used to optimize
soot-blowing in order to increase steam production, save steam
from being used in soot-blowers, and hence, increase overall boiler
efficiency.

The temperature profile of a fouled/slagged superheater tube is
illustrated in Fig. 32. The curve shows a qualitative profile, and not
computed or measured values. The steam temperature inside the
superheater tube for typical PF systems is in the range of
400(cid:1)650 °C depending on the boiler type and the materials used.
The heat transfer coefficient at the inner tube wall (number “1” in
Fig. 32) is relatively high in the range of 500 < hi,s < 5 000 Wm¡2K¡1
for steam. Even higher values are typical for liquid water with
1 000 < hi,w < 10 000 Wm¡2K¡1 or a water-steam mixture with
15 000 < hi,w/s < 600 000 Wm¡2K¡1[35]. The outer heat transfer coef-
ficient (number “4” in Fig. 32) depends on whether radiation is pres-
ent or not, and is typically in the range of 30 < ho < 100 Wm¡2K¡1.
Heat transfer in the radiant section is controlled by the heat flux and
flame temperature, whereas the convective heat exchange is domi-
nated by the temperature difference between the flue gas and the
water-steam-cycle. In the case of radiative heat exchangers, this
implies a lowered heat transfer coefficient through deposits. The
temperature profile is shifted downstream and furnace exit temper-
_
ature increases. A mathematical description of the heat flux

the flue gas to the water-steam cycle is given in Eq. (37):

therefore, a high porosity. If it is composed of condensed inorganic
vapors, it is often sticky. Couch [15] describes different mechanisms
being responsible for the initial layer formation:

(cid:3) surface attraction between fine ash and the tube,
(cid:3) local eddies in finger-like/dendritic structures,
(cid:3) inherent tube roughness due to oxide layer formation,
(cid:3) liquid phases on the tube surface,
(cid:3) thermophoresis, and
(cid:3) diffusion and condensation of inorganic vapors.

The initial layer is followed by a porous layer formed by large fly
ash particles. The conduction through this porous material exhibits
the highest resistance and thus limits heat transfer. This can be
observed by the slope in region “3” in Fig. 32. However, high uncer-
tainties exist for the effective thermal heat conductivity in the inner
layers [273]. Deposit porosity, chemistry and temperature strongly
influence thermal conductivity (see Section 3.9). During deposit
growth, larger particles are able to stick leading to irregular surfaces
structures. As the layer grows and consolidates, the surface tempera-
ture increases towards that of local gases [15,274]. The temperature
gradient inside a deposit at its outer surface can reach values in the
region of 30(cid:1)100 °C/mm, depending on its thermal conductivity and
the local heat flux [275]. Furthermore, during operation, the temper-
ature gradient can exceed 200 °C/min [276]. Hence, knowing the sur-
face temperature when predicting the particle sticking behavior can
be challenging. Wibberley [275] lists four requirements for deposit
formation [15]:

(cid:3) inorganic vapors and/or fly ash particles are able to penetrate

the boundary layer of the tube or wall and get in contact,

(cid:3) material adheres to the surface,
(cid:3) sufficient cohesion which prevents material from detaching as a
result of local turbulence, temperature changes, vibration or
gravity, and

(cid:3) thermal and chemical compatibility of the steel surface and the

depositing material.

Fig. 33(a) illustrates the process of heat transfer from the hot flue
gas to the boiler wall and the water-steam cycle. Heat is transferred
by radiation and convection to the deposit surface and conducted
through the deposit and the steel tube. The deposit radiation proper-
ties change during growth and thus heat transfer rates change [273].
Using a heat balance, one can obtain Eq. (39). Heat conduction is
equal to the energy transferred to the deposit surface due to

where Tdep,o and Tsteel,i are the deposit outer surface and steel tube

adep the absorption coefficient of the deposit layer, s the Boltzmann
constant, and edep the deposit emissivity. Calculated thermal resis-
tances for a plane boiler wall normalized to A 1⁄4 1m2 are illustrated
in Fig. 33(b). The highest thermal resistance is due to heat transfer
from the flue gas to the deposit (number 4) and through the ash
layer (number 3). Heat conduction through the initial layer shows a
relatively low value, due to the small layer thickness, and is compa-
rable to the resistance caused by the steel tube. The thermal resis-
tance due to convection on the water side strongly depends on the
flow characteristics in the tubes and is low compared to the resis-
tance of the deposit and the flue gas.

Deposit formation depends on the flow characteristics, ash parti-
cle chemistry, size and temperatures as well as the plant design.
Typical tube arrangements that can be found in boilers are shown in
Fig. 34. Commonly, the first superheater is designed as a platen array
of tubes with wide traversal pitch sT, ranging up to more than one
meter (sT/D 1⁄4 5-35), and a small longitudinal pitch sL (sL/D 1⁄4 1.2),
where D stands again for the outer tube diameter [15,253]. This
wide spacing in traversal direction is necessary in order to prevent
blockage caused by ash deposition. As flue gas temperatures cool
down, and thus, the threat of particle sticking decreases, the spacing
can be reduced leading to an increase in heat transfer surface per
unit volume. Typical values for the convective section are sT/D 1⁄4 1.5
for the traversal and sL/D 1⁄4 2 for the longitudinal pitch, respectively.

Predictions of deposit formation and growth over time are illus-
trated in Fig. 35(a) and (b). Wagoner and Yan [278] predicted chang-
ing deposit shape for different tube diameters, flue gas velocities,
particle diameters and densities, by considering inertial impaction.
The model predicts an increase in deposit layer thickness, when
tube diameter decreases, and, flue gas velocity, particle diameter or
density increases. The model reveals a high sensitivity towards parti-
cle diameter and velocity, and thus the particle kinetic energy. How-
ever, the deposit formation is highly over predicted. The layer
formed within six hours at a tube temperature of 593 °C indicating
a missing sticking criterion. Tomeczek and Wac»awiak [253] con-
ducted two-dimensional CFD simulations for different tube longitu-
dinal pitches and particle sizes. The free-stream flue gas velocity is
set to u1 1⁄4 8.36 m/s. Their study shows the influence of particle size
in particular on the cylinder rear. In general, the deposit formation
on the cylinder front is considerably higher compared with the cylin-
der rear, which agrees with observations from power stations.

The formation of ash deposits on superheater tubes and water
walls is illustrated in Fig. 36. The surface temperature of a clean
superheater tube, e.g. at the commissioning of a power plant, is
around 0.5(cid:1)10 K higher than the water-steam temperature and thus
significantly lower than flue gas temperatures. Ash particles impact-
ing on the cold surface solidify and rebound. The initial layer is
formed by heterogeneous condensation [15] or the migration of
small particles to the surface. Inorganic vapors cool down in the
boundary layer, start to saturate, and condense either directly on the
surface or to sub-micron particles which are then captured. The
inner layer is rich in K/Na, S and Cl, while the outer layer is often
more slag like, porous and rich in Ca, Si, Al, Fe and other elements
depending strongly on what fuel is fired. The outer layer is often
reported to be loosely bound and can be more easily removed by
soot-blowing compared with the inner layer. This inner layer is typi-
cally white, composed of alkali- or earth alkali-compounds and
tightly bound, as shown in Fig. 37(a) and (b). Fig. 37(b) shows a SEM
image of a superheater deposit taken from a straw-fired grate, where
the innermost layer was composed of a dense layer of K2SO4, fol-
lowed by porous layer of KCl. The outer layer was similar to fly ash
and sintered together. It is believed that the innermost layer is
formed by deposition of KCl with subsequent sulphation [280].

However, if KCl deposits as a condensed aerosol or as a vapor is not
completely understood. The exact role of aerosols during initial layer
formation is unknown. Aerosols might act as glue and probably
accelerate consolidation and chemical reactions. They fill up gaps
and voids, and thus, increase contact area between particles. Jensen
et al. [289] studied deposition rates in straw-fired grate boilers using
a deposition probe simulating superheater coils. Results are shown
in Fig. 38. An increase in aerosol concentration resulted in higher
deposition rates. These findings were confirmed for two different
boilers. Furthermore, their study revealed that the potassium con-
tent in the raw fuel correlates well with deposition rates. Again a

linear increase in deposition rate with increasing K-content in the
fuel was found. Sinquefield [244] collected deposits using sub-
micron particles simulating ash deposition in black liquor boilers. He
found a dendritic structure composed of long chains and strings of
particles growing radially outwards. The author reported sintering
of particles in these chains, however there was little contact
between different chains [244]. Kaufmann et al. [281] also showed
the importance of aerosols during deposit formation, when firing
herbaceous biomass. The authors found sub-micron particles in the
deposit and explained their deposition due to thermophoresis. An
overview on typical deposition rates for different fuels and firing

Xcoals (D

Xsee also [263,279]), and (b) deposit collected in a straw fired boiler

systems can be found in Table 7. It can be seen that most experimen-
tal studies report values around 20(cid:1)100 g/(m2 ¢ h). The deposition
rate mainly depends on the flue gas temperature, as well as the fuel
quality. Bashir et al. [284] showed that deposition rate was influ-
enced by flue gas temperature and straw-share, while changes in
probe surface temperature had no significant influence. This sug-
gests that large particles are controlled by the gas temperature and
are not affected by boundary layer effects. On the contrary, aerosol
temperatures is not crucial assuming that these particles cool down
in the boundary layer. Aerosol sticking seems to be independent of
their temperature. However, confirmation for this behavior is
needed. Weber et al. [287] reported a similar finding, where the
deposition rate and thus the sticking efficiency strongly increased
with increasing fly ash particle temperatures. Highest sticking effi-
ciencies were found for a bituminous coal ash followed by sawdust
and mixed wood, where lowest values are reported for low melting
ashes from grain and fermentation residues. There was no relation
between sticking efficiency and ash softening temperatures or calcu-
lated viscosity values found. A possible explanation could be an
increased collection efficiency of a porous deposit - in the case of
bituminous coal - compared with a molten layer - grain and

ducted in two Danish straw-fired grates.

fermentation residues - as shown in Fig. 71(a) and discussed later
on. Every incoming particle is captured in a porous layer, whereas
when a molten layer exists, particles travel around this smooth sur-
face. Kupka et al. [285] found increasing deposition rates with
increasing co-firing shares of sewage sludge, when fired with a bitu-
minous coal. This was caused by the low melting ashes of sewage
sludge. A high deposition rate was reported when firing RDF [286]. A
relatively high carbon content in the deposit might be caused by the
condensation of tars. Much lower deposition rates are reported for
the initial layer formation in a bituminous coal-fired boiler [188],
probably due to low quantities of aerosols and alkali vapors. Further-
more, this table indicates that CFD studies are likely to over estimate
deposition rates. The time required to form an initial layer is rela-
tively long and can take several weeks. Condensation is particularly
important for lignites and biomass with high shares of organically-
bound inorganics. As the layer grows, the surface temperature
increases and the formation of a liquid interface starts collecting ash
particles. In the next step, larger ash particles start to adhere and
form a powdery deposit. Again, the thicker the layer gets, the smaller
is the temperature difference between the flue gas and the deposit
surface. The deposit changes the flow around the tube and therefore
the impaction process. Particle impaction on the water wall is shown
in the lower part of Fig. 36. It is dependent on the configuration of
the tubes, i.e. whether the tubing is vertical or in a meandering pat-
tern. There are also publications reporting a deposit growth starting
at the bridge in between tubes, due to increased surface tempera-
tures at those locations [288]. Once the deposit layer grows, it can
form a molten slag layer threatening boiler operation, as shown in
the bottom right corner.

Fig. 39 shows a compilation of photographs taken from various
power plants [288]. Typical areas affected by ash deposition are pre-
sented. Fig. 39 shows:

a) a partially slagged water-wall and the nose of a two-pass boiler.
This section, introducing a change in the flow direction (boiler
nose), is particularly in danger of ash deposition. Particles can-
not follow the direction of the flow and impact on the surface.
b) a critical condition in a boiler. The cross-over path is partially
blocked and only a small section is left for the flue gas to enter
into the second pass. The flow accelerates, potentially leading to
enhanced corrosion, erosion or deposition. Deposits in this

3. Ash particle and deposit properties

Deposit and ash particle properties are crucial for estimating the
sticking probability, predicting deposit formation or estimating the

influence of deposits on boiler efficiency. Most important character-
istics are the particle/deposit viscosity, chemical composition, poros-
ity, surface tension, density or thermal conductivity. Therefore, the
following subsections summarize deposit and ash particle character-
istics and provide empirical correlations for their mathematical
description and estimation.

3.1. Material strength

The material strength can be important for the rebound behavior
of solid spheres on a heat exchanging surface [290]. Furthermore, it
is known to be crucial for deposit shedding [265]. The material
strength is usually governed by the yield stress Y, a quantity above
which a material deforms irreversibly. Below this value, the material
deforms elastically upon load, and once the load is removed, it
retains its original shape. A typical material test yielding the stress-
strain curve is the tensile test. The stress-strain curve for steel and a
brittle material are illustrated in Fig. 40. The stress expressed as load
per area (N/mm2) is determined by measuring the force applied to a
specimen. The strain is quantified by the change in length divided by
the original specimen length. At a certain point, the strain-stress
curve deviates form a proportional line, the so-called elastic limit.
For ductile materials, e.g. structural steel, this point is determined

easily by creeping. However, for brittle material this point is more
difficult to find, typically a value of 0.1 or 0.2% strain is used. This
value is often referred to as Rp,0.2 and used instead of Y. The materi-
al’s elasticity (stiffness) is described by Hooke’s law, relating stress
to strain. Within the proportional region, the slope of the stress-
strain curve reveals the materials elasticity, referred to as Young’s
modulus E and given by Eq. (41). Typically, brittle materials such as
ceramics have a considerably higher Young’s modulus compared
with steel. Analogously, the shear modulus G of a solid, elastic mate-
rial can be determined. The shear modulus describes the deforma-
tion, which takes place when a force is applied parallel to one face of
an object while the opposite face is fixed by another equal force. A
further important quantity describing the response of a material is
the Poission’s ratio n. It relates lateral strain to longitudinal strain.

Fig. 40. Yield-stress diagram for steel and brittle material.

For most materials, Poisson’s ratio will fall in the range 0(cid:1)0.5 [265].
For a perfect isotropic material, Poisson’s ratio is 0.25, with most
glasses and ceramics being between 0.20 and 0.25 [265,291]. For
linear-elastic, homogeneous and isotropic material the following
relation is valid:

The material properties Y, n and E are well documented for steel and
other materials at room temperature. A compilation of typical values
is given in Table 8. Even though values have been quantified for ash
particles [296], glass or minerals such as quartz or mullite, the varia-
tion among reported values can be high and temperature depen-
dence is often unknown. Fig. 41 shows Young’s modulus as a
function of temperature for different materials. Most of the meas-
urements are conducted for temperatures below 1000 °C and with
increasing temperature, a decrease in Young’s modulus is observed,
except for vitreous SiO2 [294]. However, it is mentioned that a
decrease is expected at higher temperatures. The lower curve shows
values for soda-lime glass measured by Marx and Sivertsen [292].
Data is extrapolated towards the melting temperature determined
either with an ash melting microscope or predicted using thermody-
namic equilibrium calculations. Uncertainty in this region is high.
The Poisson’s ratio is often reported to slightly increase with tem-
perature, but again literature is not consistent and materials behave
differently. Furthermore, particle structures vary significantly and
material properties for structures such as agglomerates are difficult
to determine. Therefore, it is doubtful that temperature-dependent
data for various ash particle compositions and structures can be
found. Ai and Kuhlmann [297] used the following temperature-
dependent relation

differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). This data is derived from
simultaneous thermal analysis (STA), where the temperature and
mass change of a sample to an inert reference sample is continuously
recorded during constant heating. The signal is shown in a DSC-T-
plot of an ash sample. The irregular shape or peaks of the signal iden-
tifies endothermic melting events, reactions or phase transitions,
while sample mass remains constant. Changes in sample mass usu-
ally indicate thermal decomposition and release of gases or chemical
reactions with the surrounding gas. By assuming, that the melt frac-
tion is proportional to the area of the DSC signal over temperature,
the following equation can be used to interpret the melt fraction:

fp Tð Þ 1⁄4

A Tð Þ
Atot

;

ð44Þ

where A is the area underneath the measured curve to a certain tem-
perature (shown in Fig. 42) and Atot the total area. The above equa-
tion leads to a continuous melting curve as shown in the melt
fraction-temperature plot in the bottom illustration of Fig. 42. Limi-
tations of this method are as follows: (1) simultaneous evaporation
processes or reactions can only be distinguished from melting pro-
cesses with additional methods; (2) individual fusion enthalpies can
differ significantly and are not taken into account; (3) the method
can only be applied to bulk ash and not to single particles. The latter
is crucial, since the chemical composition of individual ash particles
can vary significantly from the bulk ash. The melt fraction can
also be determined by thermo-mechanical analysis (TMA), where
the shrinkage of a sample is measured during heating (see e.g.
[400(cid:1)402,405]). This method was developed as an alternative to
ash fusion tests at the University of Newcastle. It yields sensitive
shrinkage measurements correlating with the formation of liquid
phases. The method is applied for various purposes including
characterization and extent of slagging [401], determination of slag
viscosity [404], or deposit structure [403].

Besides the fact that the composition of individual mineral inclu-
sions or ash particles can differ significantly from the bulk ash, the
composition of a single particle can consist of multiple species and is
influenced by a multitude of different reactions. In order to obtain a
fundamental understanding of phase transitions and melting pro-
cesses it is of crucial importance to investigate systems with only
few components to isolate single effects and reduce cross sensitivity

where a and b are fitting parameters. They used deposition experi-
ments for coal fly ash particles of different size, in order to fit coeffi-
cients a and b for the prediction of Young’s modulus. However, it is
questionable if results are applicable for other experiments, and the
influence of chemistry is missing. Here more effort for temperature-
and composition-dependent correlations is needed, similar to work
of Roberts and Garboczi [298], who presented a model for elastic
constants as a function of porosity.

3.2. Melt fraction

The melt fraction is often used to describe the stickiness of ash
particles, or the flow behavior of slags, in entrained flow gasifiers.
The melt fraction fp of ash particles is the total mass of liquid phases
or components within an ash particle or, more general, in a system,
relative to the overall mass. It is usually defined by weight, and can
take values from zero to unity, according to the following equation:

fp 1⁄4

mp;liquid
mp;liquid þ mp;solid

;

ð43Þ

where mp,liquid and mp,solid are the liquid and solid particle mass,
respectively. A method measuring the melt fraction is the differen-
tial scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis. Fig. 42 shows the signal of a

or influences from other reactions. To understand the single mecha-
nisms thermodynamic equilibrium calculations (TEC) are often used
to predict stable phases in dependence of different parameters, e.g.
composition, temperature, or atmosphere. The thermodynamic
equilibrium is based on the minimization of the Gibb’s enthalpy,
which is implemented in various commercial software codes, such
as FactSage thermochemical software and databases [306] or Chem-
App [307]. The results are plotted in so-called phase diagrams. An
example is shown in Fig. 44, for the binary system KCl-K2SO4. The
solid black lines denote phase transitions. The blue dashed line
shows exemplarily a system of constant composition of KCl and
K2SO4, which is heated from 500 to 900 °C. After exceeding the tem-
perature at point 3, the first liquid phase occurs, but K2SO4 is still in
the solid phase. Exceeding 850 °C at point 2, the solid phase K2SO4
gets liquefied. Both components (KCl and K2SO4) are entirely in the
liquid phase at point 1. When evaluating results it is important to
consider that the thermodynamic equilibrium represent an ideal sta-
ble state after infinite time. Reaction rates or catalytic effects cannot
be included.

A comparison of STA measurements and results from the phase
diagram is shown in Fig. 43. Results are presented for the vertical
blue line in Fig. 44 using a system composed of 15 mol.% KCl and
85 mol.% K2SO4. Hansen et al. [87] conducted STA measurements for
different binary salt mixtures, as well as for straw and coal ashes.
Salt mixtures show a good repeatability; the melting onset is deter-
mined within 10 °C and the melt fractions at a given temperature
within 10% when compared with phase diagrams. Ash samples

showed lower melting temperatures, between 50 and 100 °C when
compared with the ash fusion test results [87]. The authors suggest
to use CCSEM results to identify individual melting events recorded
in the STA curve. A more complex ternary phase diagram for K2O-
CaO-SiO2, can be seen in Fig. 45. This figure can explain the troubling
behavior of straw ash compared with wood ash. Straw ash particles
are typically composed of K-silicates, having an eutectic melting
temperature as low as 750 °C, at a mixture of 70 wt.% SiO2 and
30 wt.% K2O. On the contrary, Ca-rich particles have melting temper-
atures above 1500 °C (not shown for pure CaO) and thus a low sticki-
ness and adhesiveness. In real combustion systems, particles are
compounds of even more than three species and equilibrium is not
reached due to small time scales complicating the application of
phase diagrams. Nevertheless, they can be a useful indicator explain-
ing certain ash behavior. Another application was presented by Jak
[310]. The author used thermodynamic equilibrium calculations in
order to predict the ash melting behavior. Results are calculated for
Al-Ca-Fe-O-Si systems, and compared with ash fusion test results.
Results show good agreement underlining the capability of theoreti-
cal predictions. Masi(cid:2)a et al. [311] studied biomass and waste ashes
using leaching methods, STA and thermodynamic equilibrium calcu-
lations. STA measurements did not prove to be suitable for their
ashes. In contrast, equilibrium calculations showed good results and
are recommend by the authors for the determination of the melt
fraction. Wieland et al. [312] found that the predictions from STA are
shifted towards higher temperatures, compared to results from ther-
modynamic equilibrium calculations. Differences are explained by
heat transfer limitations and reaction kinetics. Babat et al. [186]
explained iron-rich deposits collected in a full-scale power station
using thermodynamic equilibrium calculations. The authors could
show that pyrite forms low melting eutectics in reducing conditions,
where melting starts at temperatures as low as 950 °C. In general,
TEC or STA methods provide useful information on the melting
behavior of ashes, however they have to be applied with care. For
predictions using TEC, databases have to be selected, which are not
fully available for the vast set of ash chemistry systems, in particular
for biomass or waste ashes. Furthermore, these predictions assume
infinite time and kinetics of chemical transformations cannot be

commonly used type of equation for the prediction of slag viscosity
is the Weymann-type (WT) equation [317] given by:

3.3. Viscosity

X¢ D

X(cid:1)25 PaD

The dynamic viscosity m (sometimes h is used instead) of ashes
or slags is frequently applied in modeling studies. Sticking criteria
are often based on particle viscosity, and flow behavior of slags in
entrained flow gasifiers is mainly described by its viscosity. Typical
slag flow is occurring when the dynamic viscosity is in the range
of mslag 1⁄4 15D
Xs, at temperatures of around 1400(cid:1)1500 °C,
depending on the fuel and ash composition [313]. At these tempera-
tures, slag can be described as a Newtonian fluid, where viscous
stresses are linearly proportional to strain rates. However, once the
slag cools down, crystals can form in the melt, and the slag can no
longer be treated in such a way. This transition point is often defined
as the critical viscosity temperature Tcv [16], and is shown in Fig. 46.
The temperature viscosity curve changes abruptly at Tcv [323]. This
temperature is time dependent and strongly affected by the crystal
formation rate and thus, there might be no single value. Instead, the
temperature of critical viscosity can change over time. Nevertheless,
attempts were made for an estimation. In order to find viscosity val-
ues, empirical relations were developed, relating slag composition
and temperature to measured viscosity values [314]. Nicholls and
Reid [315] were the first to observe that at a given viscosity the gra-
dient of the viscosity-temperature curve is similar for all coal ash
slags within the Newtonian region. This behavior is expressed by the
following equation [314]:

dm

1⁄4 f mð

Þ 61⁄4 f Tð Þ

ð45Þ

Eq. (45) implies, that if viscosity curves can be moved horizontally in
a m (cid:1) T plot, they will all overlap. This temperature shift is the prin-
ciple of many empirical models. These models describe the viscosity
in the form of an Arrhenius-type (AT) equation, by:

log m 1⁄4 A þ

B
T (cid:1) T0

;

or

where A and B are constants, and, T0 is a temperature correction

one by Watt and Fereday [319] or the S2-correlation, were developed
for British coals with a limited range of application (only valid for a
certain range of Si and Fe content, as shown in Table 9). A widely
used model considering different elements and their role in the melt
was proposed by Urbain [321]. They used the analogy of slag and
glass melts. They fitted viscosity measurements of different SiO2-
Al2O3-CaO-MgO systems to the Weymann-type equation [314,321].
Kalmanovitch and Frank [322] re-evaluated the data of Urbain [321],
and modified their equations for improved accuracy. They included
all major ash forming elements into the proposed equations, calcu-
lating the coefficients a and b. But still, the range of applicability was
limited to high temperatures, with viscosity values m < 103 PaD
Xs.
Senior and Srinivasachar [316] examined many different glass com-
positions at lower temperatures, and found a change in the slope at
approximately 104 PaD
Xs. Fig. 46 compares different slag viscosity
measurements for two coal ashes with high silica content (Reid
[324] - glassy coal ash slags with SiO2 (cid:5) 57 wt.%, and Oh et al. [325]

show a steep increase in the dm/dT-slope at around 10D
Xs,
which is considerably lower than those of glassy slags. The slope
parameter B in Eq. (46) increases from around B 1⁄4 1:1 to B 1⁄4 6:4. All
coals show a similar slope in the low- and high-temperature regime,
underlining the validity of Eq. (45). Often, the change in slope is
referred to as the critical temperature Tcv. Different approaches have
been used to predict the critical temperature. Sage and McIlroy

[326] related the hemispherical temperature from the fusion test to
the critical viscosity. Song et al. [327] showed that the critical tem-
perature correlates well with the liquidus temperatures, predicted
using FactSage, for a large number of synthetic slags. The concept of
low- and high-temperature regions is used by Senior and Srinivasa-
char [316] in their empirical model. The model concept is based on
the network structure of silicate melts. These melts can be described
4- anion. Sili-
as polymers consisting of a basic building block, the SiO4
con and oxygen have a strong covalent bonding forming a glassy sil-
ica network, which can accommodate different cations. Senior and
Srinivasachar [316] define three different categories, interacting
within the network:

(cid:3) glass formers (Si4+, Ti4+, P5+),
(cid:3) modifiers (Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, K+, Na+), and
(cid:3) amphoterics (Al3+, Fe3+, B3+).

The elements Ti4+ and P5+ can also act as glass formers, similar to
Si4+. Modifier ions lead to a lowered viscosity by disrupting the glass
structure. The last group can act as a glass former in combination
with a modifier ion by balancing their charge and thus forming a sta-
ble metal oxygen anion group fitting into the silicate network [316].
However, when modifier ions are missing in the mixture, ampho-
teric cations can act as modifiers themselves. This behavior of the
elements is often used in the glass industry or for example by Senior
and Srinivasachar in order to develop a model for the viscosity of
coal ash particles. Their goal is to provide a model being able to pre-
dict the ash particle viscosity, based on ash composition for a wide
range of temperatures. This region includes the beginning of particle
sticking at around m 1⁄4 104(cid:1)108 PaD
Xs [316]. Therefore, they used
a high- and low-temperature regime in which the dm/dT-slope
changes. In contrast, the majority of viscosity models only focuses
on the region of high temperatures, in which the slag acts as a New-
tonian fluid. However, at lower temperatures, crystals may form in
the melt, leading to a sharp increase in viscosity as shown by Fig. 46
[106]. A compilation of ash particle viscosities for different fuel ashes
and chemical compositions can be seen in Fig. 47(a). The measured
viscosity ranges over a wide span from 10(cid:1)3 for liquid salts to 105
PaD
Xs for coal slags and glasses. The lowest values are observed for
salts even at temperatures as low as 800 °C. High viscosity values
can be found at low temperatures, e.g. for glassy slags, but also at
high temperatures as soon as crystals form in the melt. In general
the viscosity of ash particles from straw combustion exhibit lowest

values followed by woody ash and coals. However, variations in
chemistry among different ash particles within one sample can lead
to a different order.

Browning et al. [314] recently published an interesting approach,
in which they investigated 1715 data points of 117 slag composi-
tions, and developed an empirical equation similar to Eq. (45). The
temperature shift is calculated composition-dependent and is given
X. The authors suggest that potassium acts as a network
in Appendix AD
former, unlike Urbain [321], who counted K+ to the network modi-
fiers. The reason why potassium increases the viscosity is its effect
on the amphoteric aluminum oxide in the slag. They further state
that the model is not valid for alumina-free samples containing K2O
[314]. A comparison of models and measured viscosities is shown in
Fig. 47. The best agreement for the high-temperature regime is
achieved with the correlation suggested by Browning et al. [314].
Viscosity models not shown in Fig. 47 showed larger deviations.
None of the models is able to predict the changing slope at lower
temperatures. It is concluded that viscosity can be predicted rela-
tively well in the region of high temperatures for typical coal slags.
However, predicting ash particle viscosity at lower temperatures
and with a highly variable composition is still challenging. The
model of Senior and Srinivasachar [316] is validated for glassy slags
containing modifiers. However, if particles have no modifiers or high
Fe or Ca contents in the absence of Si, the correlation might yield
unsatisfying results. Nevertheless, this model is the only available
one in literature being capable of predicting the viscosity at lower
temperatures of 800(cid:1)1300 °C, which are typical for ash particle
deposition in a boiler.

In general, there is a need for better viscosity models in particular
for Ca-rich or salt-rich ashes - typical for biofuels. Vargas et al. [323]
compared viscosity models and their predictive capabilities with a
number of viscosity measurements mainly for silicates. Best perfor-
mance was attributed to the model of Bottinga and Weill [320].
Another model showing good agreement with measurements, is the
model of Browning et al. [314]. However, both are only valid for
silicates in a certain range of composition and in the Newtonian
region at high temperatures. Therefore, more fundamental work
should be directed towards models for biomass ashes and for lower
temperatures.

A method considering the formation of crystals in the melt, and
their influence on the viscosity, was presented by a number of stud-
ies. Vargas et al. [323] present an overview on models relating the
solid fraction of crystals in the melt to the viscosity of the mixture

mmix and the liquid phase mliq, respectively. The models differ in their
complexity - all models consider the amount of crystals and some
can consider the crystal shape. Vargas et al. [323] describes two clas-
ses, models for dilute suspensions with mostly spherical crystals
such as the work of Einstein [334], Vand [335], Sherman [336], Ros-
coe [337], and models for dense slurries, e.g. Quemada [338]. A vali-
dation of these models is beyond the scope of this work, however,
data of Oh et al. [325] is used to compare model predictions. There-
fore, the viscosity of the melt is predicted using the composition of
the Pittsburgh #8 ash and a fit of the model of Browning et al. [314].
The measurements and predictions are shown in Fig. 48(a) as points
and dashed line, respectively. Relatively good agreement is observed
at high temperatures. With decreasing temperature, a sharp increase
of the measured viscosity is observed at around 1270 °C due to crys-
tal formation. The fraction of crystals (solids) in the melt is deter-
mined using thermodynamic equilibrium calculations (FactSage and
the FToxide database [306]). The blue curve shows the fraction of
solids as a function of temperature. First crystals are predicted at
around 1650 °C. A significant increase in the solid fraction is
observed at around 1350 °C. The third curve (continuous line) in
Fig. 48(a) shows the predicted viscosity of the solid-liquid mixture

assumed to equal c 1⁄4 2:5 and d 1⁄4 9:15 [325,339]. A further model

model for liquid melts. However, these model require the fraction of
crystals in the melt and therefore additional effort.

3.4. Rheology

The fluid flow behavior, often referred to as rheological behavior,
of coal ashes and/or slags is complex and controversy. Fluids are
classified as time-independent fluids or time-dependent fluids.
Both are illustrated in Fig. 49. The most common time-independent
fluid is a Newtonian fluid describing most gases and liquids. Viscos-
ity is expressed as the ratio of shear stress to shear rate. Pseudo-
plastic fluid, often called shear-thinning material, shows a decrease
in viscosity with increasing rate of deformation. The fluid is termed
plastic, if this effect is very strong. Typical examples are polymeric

solutions or melts [323]. The opposite behavior is rarely observed. It
is termed dilatant or shear-thickening. Bingham plastics are fluids
which require a finite deformation to initiate flow, e.g. tooth paste.
Time-dependent fluids exhibit a changing shear stress with duration
of shear [323]. Thixotropic fluids have a decreasing viscosity with
time of shear, thus a time-dependent shear-thinning. This decrease
in viscosity is often caused by structural changes or breakdown in
the fluid. The behavior is shown in Fig. 49(b), where the shear rate is
steadily increased at a constant rate to a maximum value and then
decreased to zero. During the decrease a lower shear stress is
observed yielding a typical hysteresis curve. Paints, ink or mayon-
naise behave this way. Again, the opposite behavior, so-called rheo-
pectic fluid, is rarely observed. A special form of time-dependent
fluids are viscoelastic materials. They behave as both, viscous fluids
and elastic solids. The elasticity is typically a result of bond stretch-
ing along crystallographic planes, whereas the viscosity is due to dif-
fusion of atoms or molecules inside an amorphous material [340].
Viscoelastic materials have a characteristic time constant called
relaxation time. If deformation takes places during longer periods
than this relaxation time, the material behaves as a viscous fluid.
Within shorter periods, the material is deformed and recovers to its
original shape after deformation [341]. Losurdo et al. [342] used vis-
coelatic models to describe ash behavior. This is an interesting
approach, however experimental confirmation for this behavior is
still due.

The actual behavior of ash particles or slags is rarely studied. Typ-
ically, viscosity curves are measured and described with empirical
equations. Song et al. [343] investigated the flow behavior of coal
ash slags, using a high-temperature rheometer. The effect of shear
rate and temperature on viscosity are studied between 1200 and
1340 °C. The authors found that the sensitivity of slag viscosity to
temperature variation decreased with increasing shear rate. They
observed a thixotropic behavior, which could be related to the for-
mation of crystalline phases during cooling. Vargas et al. [323]
reviewed measurements on the viscosity of silicate melts with vari-
ous compositions. Non-Newtonian fluid behavior was only present
when crystals appeared in the melt or a separation of the melt in
two or more immiscible liquid phases occurred.

Rheology is only important when crystals form inside the melt.
However, data for the effect of time and deformation on viscosity
are rare. Liquid melts behave as Newtonian fluids and are thus rather
simple to describe. In general, viscosity should be described with
composition- and temperature-dependent models. The effect of
time and stress on viscosity can neglected due to its complex nature,
and weak data set available in the literature.

3.5. Surface tension

The surface tension g (in N/m) is typically used in particle defor-
mation calculations, such as droplet impaction on a surface in inter-
nal combustion engines. In some publications it is defined as the
variable s. Generally, the higher the surface tension is, the stronger
are the forces to reduce the surface area of a droplet. Surface tension
can be estimated using the composition-dependent relation [273],

3.6. Contact angle with the substrate

The contact angle Qc of a liquid droplet with a substrate is illus-
trated in Fig. 50. The contact angle and the so-called wetting, i.e. the
area that is covered with the liquid, strongly depend on the liquid
and its surface tension, as well as the substrate’s surface energy and
X(cid:7) 90° correspond to a high
morphology. Small contact angles QcD
wettability, low surface tension of the droplet, a good adhesiveness
and high solid surface free energy [346,347]. The contact angle can
be described mathematically using Young’s equation [348]:

(cid:5)
¢ cos Qc

(cid:6)

;

ð52Þ

gSV 1⁄4 g SL þ gLV
where g SV, g SL and g LV are the solid-vapor, solid-liquid and liquid-
vapor surface tension. All three interfacial tensions act as forces on
the droplet, and the contact angle forms under mechanical equilib-
rium for an ideal surface [347]. In reality, this equilibrium is often
not observed, instead the contact line is always moving, leading
to a dynamic contact angle [347]. Often the liquid(cid:1)vapor and
solid(cid:1)vapor surface tension is approximated with the droplet’s and
substrate’s surface tension and free energy, respectively. Another
method relates the contact angle to the surface tension of a droplet
g p and the work of adhesion following the Young(cid:1)Dupr(cid:2)e equation:
gp

(cid:6)
(cid:6)

(cid:5)

where Wad is the work of adhesion and A the contact area between
the droplet and the substrate. Since surface tension and viscosity
values of molten ash particles are fairly high compared with e.g.
water droplets, the contact angle of ash droplets on steel tubes or
ceramics show typically high values. The contact angle measure-
ment is a challenging task, in particular for ash particles since they
require high temperatures in order to become liquid. One technique
is the so-called Moza-Austin sticking test [349]. A pellet of mineral
or ash is formed, and held in the center of a ring burner flame, until
it melts and falls onto a pretreated steel specimen (typically oxi-
dized), maintained at a certain temperature relevant for heat
exchangers. The contact angle of the solidified droplet was deter-
mined optically, and the adhesion force determined by shearing the
droplet off the surface [349]. By using this method, realistic values
for supercooled surfaces are obtained, which differ from equilibrium
contact angles. Heat exchangers are typically much colder compared
with ash melting temperatures. Therefore, heat transfer and cooling
affect the contact angle of ash particles with the surface. Ni et al.
[333] used a Boltzmann-type equation, and fitted measurements of
Abbott and Austin [350], in the form of:

where constants were determined to A 1⁄4 100; B 1⁄4 150; C 1⁄4 445 and
D 1⁄4 35 to reproduce measurements from Abbott et al. [351] shown
in Fig. 51 and T is the substrate temperature. Abbott et al. [351] mea-
sured the contact angle and adhesive force of synthetic ash mixtures,
on a preoxidized carbon steel, maintained at temperatures up to
700 °C. It can be seen that the contact angle decreases with increas-
ing substrate temperature. The droplet cools slower upon contact
and thus plastic deformation is increased due to lower viscosity val-
ues. The adhesive force increases rapidly with increasing substrate
temperature, showing a higher connectivity, which can explain
accelerated deposit formation at higher steel temperatures. Similar
tests were conducted using pyrite, pyrite-quartz, pyrite-kaolinite
and pyrite-illite mixtures [350]. Considerably lower contact angles
down to 50° with high adhesive forces were observed in the case of
pyrite-illite mixtures. Probably caused by a low melting eutectic.

Another method for determining the contact angle is the capillary
bridge method developed by Restagno et al. [352]. This method puts
a spherical solid surface in contact with a liquid, as illustrated
in Fig. 52. The contact angle can be approximated by the following
relation:

(cid:5)

where A represents the wetted area, h is the distance between the
particle and the surface from the liquid bath, and k¡1 is the capillary
length, which is known for common liquids [347]. The area A
strongly depends on the distance h. This method has some similari-
ties compared with solid ash particles impacting a molten, slagged
surface. The area A, which is a function of geometry and liquid

properties can be used to estimate adhesive forces preventing the
particle from rebound. However, further research in this area is
needed.

3.7. Density

The density of a deposit or a slag layer depends on porosity and
chemical composition, where the following equation relates the
true/solid density rdep,true to the apparent density rdep,app:
(cid:6)
:

(cid:5)

A simple estimation of the true density can be achieved by using the
empirical correlation rdep;true 1⁄4 2:54 þ 0:00978 ¢ wFe2O3
in g/cm3,
where wFe2O3 is the mass fraction of Fe2O3. A more sophisticated
approach was developed for slags and uses the method of partial
molar densities [345,353],

where V i is the partial molar volume, xi is the molar fraction and Mi
is the molar mass of species “i”. Values for the partial molar volumes
can be taken from Table 10D
X. Temperature-dependent density
changes are small and often neglected.

3.8. Sintering and fusion

Measurements on the sintering behavior of ash deposits are rare.
Models are mainly developed for metal powders such as the one pre-
sented by Mackenzie and Shuttleworth [354]. They developed a sin-
tering model for viscous flow sintering, similar to the following

medium carbon steel (SA515). Data taken form [351].

where pdep,0 is the initial deposit porosity, dp is the average pore size
(average particle size is used in this work), and x is an added fitting
parameter. Fig. 53 shows the calculated sintering behavior of a Pitts-
burgh #8 ash. An initial porosity of pdep;0 1⁄4 0:5 and a fitting parame-
ter of x 1⁄4 1000 are assumed to calculate sintering for different
temperatures. It can be seen that sintering starts at around 1100 °C.
Without the fitting parameter, sintering to pdep 1⁄4 0 would occur
within seconds for a temperature of 1100 °C. Meinel [356] used a
similar value to fit his results. Generally, a slight increase in temper-
ature leads to a strong decrease in porosity. Eq. (58) depends on
deposit viscosity, which is a strong function of temperature. The cal-
culations shown in Fig. 53 are carried out for viscosity measure-
ments of the Pittsburgh #8 ash (see Fig. 46). The surface tension of
ash particles is calculated based on Eqs. (50) and (51). Gupta et al.
[357] reported the same temperature range in which sintering is
observed (900(cid:1)1200 °C). The presented equations can also be used
to describe melting by adjusting the parameter x. Another type of
sintering, besides sintering due to viscous forces, is caused by chemi-
cal reactions, as described in Section 2.5.4. Typical reactions leading
to a decrease in porosity can be carbonation or sulfation [31].

3.9. Thermal conductivity and radiative properties

Thermal conductivity and radiative properties of deposits define
the temperature profile in the deposit and thus, heat transfer to the
water-steam cycle as illustrated in Fig. 32. Therefore, these parame-
ters are of importance not only for modeling studies, but also for
boiler operation. Heat
is often
expressed by an effective thermal heat conductivity, keff that com-
bines heat conduction and radiation which might occur in parallel or
in series [273]. Radiation increases the heat conductivity through a
porous deposit by penetrating the inside structure and absorption of
radiation. Heat conduction through a deposit can then be expressed
as one-dimensional, transient heat transfer through a cylindrical
shell by:

transfer through the deposit

Fig. 53. Porosity decrease as a function of temperature over time due to sintering
(calculated for a Pittsburgh #8 ash using Eq. (58)).

This equation considers the temperature change as a function of
time t and radial direction r, where rdep is the deposit density, and
cp,dep is the deposit heat capacity. This equation can be solved analyt-
ically by ignoring the transient term to [32]:

ð60Þ

where q is the surface heat flux and the index “i” denotes the deposit
inner surface. Using this equation, the steady-state temperature pro-
file in a deposit layer can be calculated with the surface heat flux
and effective thermal conductivity. The effective thermal conductiv-
ity is mainly dependent on deposit characteristics such as:

(cid:3) porosity and degree of sintering,
(cid:3) temperature of the deposit,
(cid:3) particle size,
(cid:3) chemical composition, and
(cid:3) radiative properties.

The deposit porosity pdep has the strongest impact on the thermal
conductivity. A decrease in porosity leads to an increase in the effec-
tive thermal conductivity, and enhances heat transfer. Robinson
et al. [358] found that the initial layer has a relatively low thermal
conductivity due to its particulate structure and relatively high
porosity. However, in the case of biomass, this layer can consist of
condensates and therefore have a molten, dense structure and high
conductivity. Outer layers show a sintered structure with strongly
increased thermal conductivities. Fig. 54(a) shows measurements of
deposit thermal conductivity with varying porosity values. Rezaei
et al. [246] measured the thermal conductivity for a set of differ-
ent coal ashes. The porosity strongly depends on the deposit
type. It decreases in the order of: powdery > particulate > sin-
tered > molten type of deposit. Typical values range from 0.1
for molten deposit with gas inclusions, up to 0.9 for a loosly-
layers [358(cid:1)360]. The porosity is
bound, powdery deposit
reduced with time due to sintering. This causes a densification of
the deposit, and thus, an irreversible increase in effective ther-
mal conductivity [273].

Fig. 54(b) shows the influence of temperature on measured ther-
mal conductivities. As a general rule, a slight increase in thermal
conductivity with increasing temperature, can be observed. Rezaei
et al. [246] found that the change in thermal conductivity, is more
pronounced at higher temperatures. They explain this behavior by
sintering. Above temperatures of 600(cid:1)800 °C sintering occurs, lead-
ing to an irreversible change in morphology and thereby a change in
deposit thermal conductivity. Gupta et al. [357] found coal ash sin-
tering between 900 and 1200 °C. This change in structure and parti-
cle connectivity leads to a higher thermal conductivity during the
cooling of the sample, as shown in Fig. 54(b). A description of the
measurement device can be found in the work of Rezaei et al. [246].
Anderson et al. [361] give another explanation for the strong
increase at higher temperatures: Thermal radiation is causing an
increase, at temperatures above 500 °C. Their measurements show a
strong increase at around 1200 °C, which might also be due to fusion
of the sample. The samples of Rezaei et al. [246] did not show a sig-
nificant change in porosity after cooling. They explained the
increased thermal conductivity during cooling by sintering, which
caused a better connectivity between the individual particles, but
only a slight change in porosity. Zbogar et al. [273] give a further
explanation, based on changes in emissivity upon structural
changes.

Not much literature is available on the influence of particle size
on heat conductivity. Rezaei et al. [246] sieved two coal ash samples
to particles smaller than dp < 45 mm and between 45 (cid:2) dp < 106 mm.

Fig. 54. Thermal conductivity and its theoretical boundaries: (a) as a function of porosity and (b) as a function of temperature (measurements taken from Rezaei et al. [246], origi-
nal data also from Anderson et al. [361]).

Both unsintered ash samples show an increased thermal conductiv-
ity by 30% to 100%, when coarse particles are used. But the authors
do not explain this behavior. The review of Zbogar et al. [273] found
an increase with increasing particle size at higher temperatures,
whereas at low temperatures no change is observed. A possible
explanation are changed radiative properties for larger particles.
Wall et al. [362], found a sharp decrease in deposit absorbance, adep,
for an initial layer composed of small, sub-micron particles. They
further state that small particles reflect most of the incident radia-
tion, whereas large particles show a high absorbance.

The influence of the chemical composition dominates the sin-
tering and melting behavior of ash deposits and therefore also its
structure and thermal conductivity. Rezaei et al. [246] found only
small changes at identical sample porosities. But they refer to the
glass industry, where correlations were developed yielding an equa-
tion for a composition-dependent thermal conductivity [366]. Raask
[12] found a lowered sintering temperature for iron-rich slags, and,
thus, an increased thermal conductivity. This is confirmed by com-
paring thermal conductivities of different materials, as shown in
Table 11. It can be seen that glasses (silica-rich) have a considerably
lower thermal conductivity, compared to magnetite (Fe2O3). A vol-
ume-weighted correlation might be suitable to calculate the thermal
conductivity of the mixture [273,362]. Wall et al. [367] also state
that the chemical composition affects emissivity. The presence of
coloring agents, such as iron, leads to an increased absorptivity, and,
thus, a higher deposit temperature, which then influences sintering
and deposit properties. An interesting approach is presented by Mills
et al. [368] relating the thermal conductivity of a solid ash particle kp
at room temperature to its chemical composition. The authors
use NBO/T ratio, defined as the ratio of non-bridging oxygens to
tetrahedral/bridging oxygens in a melt (see [14] or the Appendix A,

where the Q value is related to the NBO/T ratio. Eq. (61) is valid in
the range of 2 < Q < 3.3 [368]. With this equation, increased thermal
conductivities are predicted when the iron content increases. How-
ever, more experimental evidence is needed and the range is very
limited.

Radiative properties are difficult to measure and influenced by
a number of parameters. They depend on temperature, wavelength
of radiation, structure of the deposit, average particle size and its
chemical composition. Often, deposit emissivity is treated as a gray
body (not a function of wavelength) and as opaque (transmissivity
equals zero). Wall et al. [367] state that a deposit must have a
thickness of 1 mm or more in order to be considered as opaque.
Furthermore, an increased particle size in a deposit leads to
a higher emissivity [370]. On the contrary, the emissivity of ash
particles strongly depends on iron and residual carbon content. If
both, Fe and C, are present, reported emissivity values are consider-
ably higher. Burning char particles show values around ɛp 1⁄4 0:9
depending on char conversion and mineral matter content. Litera-
ture values show large variations due to the heterogeneity of par-
ticles and deposits as well as the dependence on many process
parameters. Typical values for deposit and particle emissivities are
given in Table 12.

porous media or a packed bed often applies so-called “unit cell” or

“pseudo-homogeneous” models; see also the review of Zbogar et al.
[273]. The difference between both is the treatment of thermal radi-
ation. “Unit cell” models treat radiation as a local effect taking place
between adjacent particle surfaces and voids in the unit cell [273].
They either add the radiative conductivity by

keff 1⁄4 kg(cid:1)s þ krad

;

ð62Þ

where kg-s is the effective thermal conductivity through the porous
media, and krad is the increase in thermal conductivity by thermal
radiation. Or they include the radiative conductivity as a resistance
in the network. “Pseudo-homogeneous” models consider packed
beds to be a continuum for radiation, where the bed is often
assumed to be a pseudo-homogeneous medium, in which radiation
can penetrate freely [273]. An estimation of theoretical boundaries
for thermal conductivities can be achieved by comparing the gas kg
and solid ks thermal conductivity. Rezaei et al. [246], suggest the fol-
lowing empirical, temperature-dependent correlation, for the flue
gas thermal conductivity kg:
kg 1⁄4 0:00038 ¢ T0:75:

ð63Þ

This equation is illustrated in Fig. 54(b) as the lower boundary
(dashed line) and roughly yields temperature-dependent values for
air. The solid thermal conductivity ks (also shown in Fig. 54(b) by the
continuous line) is the upper boundary when the deposit has no
porosity. It can be estimated by [246]:
ks 1⁄4 0:0015 ¢ T1:1

ð64Þ

Both Eqs. (63) and (64) can then be applied to calculate theoretical
boundaries for heat conduction of packed beds. The upper boundary
is given by heat transfer in the direction of parallel layers of gas and

solid material. Fig. 54(a) shows this curve as a continuous line. A
mathematical expression is given by:

Different models were developed for calculating the thermal con-

in Table 13. Mathematical descriptions are given in the review of
Zbogar et al. [273]. A comparison of model predictions and measure-
ments available in literature, is given in Figs. 55(a) and (b). It can be
seen that best agreement is achieved by the model of Brailsford and
Major [381]. At both, low and high temperatures, predictions follow
measurements of Rezaei et al. [246] well. Brailsford and Major [381]

have been proposed. They are summarized by Zbogar et al. [273].
Best results are obtained with Eq. (68). Figs. 56(a) and (b) compare
the effective thermal conductivity considering both radiation and
conduction through a porous media. Measurements of Mulcahy

emissivity value of ɛ

dp 1⁄4 350 mm. The measurements of Anderson et al. [361] could not
be reproduced adequately with the given equations. Deviations are
probably due to changing structures during heating such as sintering
and fusion. These are often reported to be more important than
increased heat conduction through radiation [273].

3.10. Aerosol properties

4. Ash particle sticking behavior

Particles in the sub-micron size range exhibit some interesting
phenomena. For instance, the melting temperatures of nanopar-
ticles starts to decrease [376]. Fig. 57(a) shows the melting temper-
ature of aluminum particles as a function of particle size. Different
theoretical studies are in agreement with measurements of Eckert
et al.
[373]. The melting temperature of aluminum starts to
decrease down to values of 200 °C for particles in the size range of
10 nm, compared to melting temperatures of 660 °C of bulk alumi-
num. Other studies reported a decrease in surface tension for nano-
particles. The surface tension of aerosol depends on the so-called
Tolman-length dTol [377]. Both effects are often studied theoreti-
cally since measurements in this size range are highly complex
and require high efforts. The role of such effects is questionable.
Section 2.3.3 on aerosols has shown that the majority of sub-
micron particles is found in the size range of dp (cid:5) 100(cid:1)200 nm,
probably as agglomerates of smaller particles. If these agglomer-
ates have primary particles below 50 nm, effects can become rele-
vant. However, uncertainty is high and more studies in this field
are needed.

referred to as substrate D

cle will remain on the surface (2), if its kinetic energy is dissipated
during the collision. If the particle kinetic energy is higher than the
energy dissipated during collision, it will rebound (1) [290,384,385].
The dissipation of energy can be due to deformation,
friction
between particle and surface, or adhesion [222]. Typically, it is dis-
X(cid:1) sometimes referred
tinguished between an elastic and an inelastic D
to as plastic D
X(cid:1) collision. An elastic collision is defined as a collision of
two bodies, where there is no loss in kinetic energy. The kinetic
energy of two bodies after collision equals to their total kinetic
energy before the encounter. This type only occurs in theory, when
there is no conversion of kinetic energy into other forms such as
heat. An inelastic collision, in contrast, is a collision in which kinetic
energy is converted in other forms. There are energy losses due to
e.g. internal friction, plastic deformation, vibrations and others. Ash
particles occur as pure solids, liquids and mixtures [323], and are
therefore assumed to collide inelastic, with and without plastic
deformation. Examples of collisions with plastic deformation are
particles with low viscosity values at high temperatures spreading
during impact (3). Particles deform at the surface and retain their
deformed shape, either due to cooling and solidification, or low sur-
face tensions. The maximum spread diameter dp,max is frequently
used to describe this phenomenon. This type of impaction can be
identified by deformed ash particles found in the cross-section of a
deposit. Splash (4) or rebound with breakup (5) are not reported for
ash particles due to their relatively high viscosity and high surface
tension.

The forces acting on a particle settled on a substrate are shown in
Fig. 59. The particle is in contact with the surface, forming an inter-
face, which depends on particle and surface properties. The contact
diameter dp,max (also called spread diameter) mainly depends on the
particle viscosity, surface tension/energy and roughness. The contact
angle Qc is typically large for ash particles, which indicates poor
adhesiveness, low wettability due to high surface tension, and low
free surface energy. This behavior can also be observed for a liquid
water droplet on a hydrophobic surface. The forces acting on the
particle can be divided into forces acting parallel and perpendicular

and Malayeri [386], originally from Cabrejos and Klinzing [387]).

to the substrate. Parallel forces are drag, friction and shear forces
induced by the flow in the boundary layer. Perpendicular forces are
lift, buoyancy, gravity, thermophoresis, and surface forces, being
caused by adhesion or van der Waals forces. Depending on the
geometry, forces can act in different directions, in particular for a
superheater tube. Another parameter affecting particle sticking can
be due to shock cooling upon impaction on the surface. The temper-
ature difference between flue gas and clean heat exchanger can be
as high as DT 1⁄4 T 1 (cid:1) TW 1⁄4 500 K, leading to a rapid cooling of ash
particles within the boundary layer and/or during the impaction.
Here, the Biot number plays an important role, whether there is a
temperature gradient inside the particle (Bi > 0.1), or not (Bi (cid:2) 0.1).
The Biot number is defined as Bi 1⁄4 h ¢ dp=kp; where h is the total heat
transfer coefficient between particle and flue gas. The effects taking
place in the boundary layer are rarely addressed in literature.
Despite this lack, many different particle sticking criteria have been
developed. They can be classified in three main groups - sticking cri-
teria based on the melt fraction of a solid particle, based on the par-
ticle viscosity or based on energy conservation during the collision.

4.1. Critical melt fraction

This criterion uses the melt fraction of a particle to judge its stick-
ing probability. Is the melt fraction above a critical value, a particle is
assumed to adhere. While pure substances melt at a defined temper-
ature, multi-component systems can melt over a wider temperature
range. Often, thermodynamic equilibrium calculations are carried
out for multi-component system to calculate the melt fraction based
on composition and temperature. See for example the work of Wie-
land et al. [312] who calculated the melting curves for two coal ashes
(Pittsburgh #8 and El Cerrejon). Isaak et al. [388,389] were the first
to propose the melt fraction as a sticking criteria for salt particles in
black liquor combustion systems (black liquor is a Na-rich residue of
the pulp and paper industry). M€uller et al. [202] used thermody-
namic equilibrium calculations for synthetic salt mixtures. Another
method is to use simultaneous differential thermal analysis, where
the melting curve is measured in a thermo-gravimetric analyzer
(TGA). Wieland et al. [312] also conducted this method for coal ashes
of the Pittsburgh #8 and El Cerrejon. M€uller et al. [202] use a critical
melt fraction of fp;crit 1⁄4 15%, at which particles are assumed to
adhere. They measured deposition rates on a cooled probe (550 °C)
in an entrained flow reactor maintained at 1000 °C and a flow veloc-
ity of 2 m/s. Different salt particles are used and 50 g are fed over a
time interval of 40 min. They further used numerical simulations to
calculate deposition rates on the cooled probe. M€uller et al. [202]
found that the deposit layer will grow until the surface temperature
reaches a value at which 70% are molten. At this point, they assume
an equilibrium between incoming particles and deposit flowing off.
The sticking probability pstick is defined as:
for fp 1⁄4 0 (cid:1) 0:15
0
1 for fp 1⁄4 0:15 (cid:1) 0:7
0 for fp 1⁄4 0:7 (cid:1) 1

The numbers of fp 1⁄4 0.15 and fp 1⁄4 0.7 are not universal numbers,
and different values can be used instead. A comparison between
numerical simulations and experiments shows a good correlation
for particles smaller than 75 mm. For larger particles, predictions
overestimate the mass deposited. M€uller et al. [202] infer that the
critical melt fraction is not applicable for larger particles. They sug-
gest an energy criterion based on the work of Mao et al. [390]
(see Section 4.3), which yielded better results.

Zhou et al. [391] developed a mathematical model describing the
deposit build-up over time. It goes back to work of Hansen et al.
[392] and Kær [393]. They apply a critical melt fraction model for
particles larger than dp > 10 mm, in which particles are treated as
sticky once they reach fp (cid:3) 10%. Zhou et al. define a sticking probabil-
ity for particles between 10% < fp (cid:2) 70%. In this region, the sticking
probability increases linearly. Unlike M€uller et al. [202], every parti-
cle above fp > 70% is assumed to stick. Eq. (70) summarizes their
model:

Particles between 10% < fp (cid:2) 70% are assumed to show splash
behavior (Nr. 4 in Fig. 58). Only part of the ash particle adheres to
the wall, while the remaining mass rebounds. A decrease in depos-
ited mass is described by slag flow and drop-off as well as erosion.
They use a dynamic mathematical model, which is based on a set of
equations and estimations. It is not coupled to CFD, and needs many
input parameters, such as particle concentration, velocity and size.
Nevertheless, their results show good agreement with experimen-
tally observed deposition rates from a grate-fired boiler using straw
as a feedstock. There are further studies using particle sticking crite-
ria based on a critical melt fraction. Akbar et al. [258] uses a similar
criterion as M€uller et al. [202], however, they do not provide a stick-
ing probability above fp 1⁄4 70%. They studied the deposition behavior
of KCl particles from biomass combustion in an entrained flow reac-
tor using a cooled deposition probe with a temperature of 650 °C.
Their modeling results indicate the dominant role of condensation
effects during early stages in biomass-fired systems. Brink et al.
[394] used the melt fraction predicted by TEC in order to describe
the particle stickiness. The maximum temperature a particle has
experience in the flame is assumed to control the amount of amor-
phous slag phase. This history based approach is an interesting
aspect, which should be included in modeling studies, ideally in a
comprehensive ash formation model.

4.2. Critical viscosity

Another frequently applied particle sticking criterion is based on
the viscosity of ash particles. Particles are softer and stickier at lower
viscosity values. Different approaches have been proposed in the lit-
erature.

A viscosity-based sticking criterion for ash particles was first pro-
posed by Walsh et al. [395]. They carried out ash deposition tests of
two bituminous coals, at the MIT combustion tunnel, with a heat
input of 1.5 MWth. The gas temperature at the deposition probe was
in the range of 1450(cid:1)1480 °C, the probe was maintained at 540 °C,
and the gas velocity had a value of vg 1⁄4 15 m/s [395]. The sticking
probability is calculated by:

remaining on the surface is calculated by mp,ref/mp. This approach
was applied in several studies, however, inaccuracies in the use
emerged. Often, a binary sticking criterion was used instead, where
mp,crit is the critical viscosity, at which sticking of particles starts to
occur. Above this critical value, particles are assumed to rebound. It
is defined as:

mp;ref 1⁄4 0:01¢mp;crit between reference and critical viscosity. Table 14
summarizes reference and critical viscosity values, found in litera-
ture. A large variation between 2 and 109 PaD
Xs, can be seen. This var-
iation can have several reasons. The chemistry and melting behavior
can have an influence, where at a given viscosity one particle is
sticky and another is not. Another reason could be different particle
velocities. Studies with low critical/reference viscosity used rela-
tively high particle velocities (Walsh et al. [395] with 15 m/s and
experiments of Liebetruth et al. [396] are estimated around 8 m/s).
This would indicate a dependence on particle kinetic energy.
Another problem is the use of bulk ash chemistry and bulk ash vis-
cosity values. Bulk ash can have significantly higher viscosities com-
pared to individual ash particles forming low-melting eutectics for
example. A large number of modeling studies use bulk ash chemistry
and results can be misleading.

Srinivasachar et al. [1] conducted experiments with soda-lime
glass particles. The advantage of such a material is that there are no
particle-to-particle variations in density, structure or chemical com-
position, and it has a well-known temperature-viscosity curve. Fur-
thermore, it is reported to behave similar to coal ashes [1]. They
used a heated laminar flow furnace, and placed the deposition probe
in a conical section. The fluid velocity can be set by changing the
position within this conical section. Narrow-sized soda-lime glass
X(cid:1)74 mm) were used to fix particle kinetic
particles (28D
energy. At a given kinetic energy, the temperature in the system is
varied and the threshold, at which sticking begins is determined.
This temperature corresponds to the critical viscosity value. Fig. 60
shows the particle kinetic energy Ep,kin as a function of critical viscos-
ity mp,crit. With increasing particle kinetic energy, a lower particle
viscosity and thus higher temperature is needed for a particle to
stick. In other words, the smaller a particle the higher its sticking

probability at a given temperature and chemical composition.
Richter [222] did similar experiments in an entrained flow reactor
with lower particle velocities and confirmed this relationship. A
third study was conducted at the Energy Research Center of the
Netherlands (ECN) with higher particle velocities and a cooled steel
probe [201]. An overview of experimental conditions is given in
Table 15. The following empirical correlation can be derived from
the data points by a least square fit. The critical viscosity is a power-
law function of the particle kinetic energy,

of solid particles, the impaction process involves elastic deforma-
tion and depending on the particle kinetic energy and the mate-
rial properties also plastic deformation. On the contrary, elastic
deformation is negligible during liquid droplet impact. Droplets
deform heavily and might break-up. Therefore, the focus is on
the energy dissipation due to particle deformation, the particle
break-up and phenomena occurring when substrate and particle
temperature differ significantly.

where coefficients A and B are determined from Fig. 60. The particle
viscosity is then used in combination with Eqs. (72) and (73). Par-
ticles stick to the surface, if the calculated particle viscosity is below
the critical viscosity, and rebound if mp > mp,crit. Fig. 60 also shows
corresponding particle sizes for an exemplary velocity of 10 m/s
(secondary horizontal axis), and the equivalent temperature to vis-
cosity values of soda-lime glass particles (secondary vertical axis).
Experiments for very small particles are missing. A further binary
sticking criteria was proposed by Richards et al. [408]. They define a
particle as sticky, when the particle viscosity is below the ash melt-
ing viscosity. However, the melting viscosity is difficult to determine
and various definitions exist in literature. The criterion uses again
the bulk ash and not the individual chemical composition of fly ash
particles.

4.3. Energy conservation and critical velocity

A further method is based on energy conservation of a parti-
cle, during impact. This method was often applied for solid par-
ticles impacting a smooth, flat surface using contact mechanics,
or in the field of liquid droplets impinging on a smooth wall. The
main difference is the particle/droplet deformation. In the case

4.3.1. Solid particle impacting a solid smooth surface

The energy balance is used to calculate critical parameters, such
as the critical velocity. If the particle velocity is smaller than this crit-
ical value, particles stick, in all other cases particles rebound. The
particle velocity can either be the absolute value vp, or the normal
component vp,n relative to the surface, which becomes important for
oblique (non-normal) impacts, e.g. on a superheater tube. An energy
balance, which might be suitable for ash particle impaction is given
by the following equation:

The parameters in Eq. (74) are the particle kinetic energies Ekin, the
particle surface energies Esurf, the work of viscous dissipation (defor-
mation) Edef, and the work of adhesion Ead. The index “i” stands for
initial conditions of impacting particles and “r” for rebounding par-
ticles. Particles stick, if the kinetic energy on the right equals zero.
Further energies involved, such as potential energy, rotational ener-
gies of the particle, energy due to van der Waals forces between two
solids or elastic wave propagation (during collision, when part of the
energy is radiated into the substrate as elastic waves) are often
neglected [390]. Eq. (74) can then be applied to calculate critical
parameters, such as the critical velocity vp,crit, and evaluate the

incoming particles, with particles deposited on a substrate. This equa-

particle deposition experiments, conducted at ECN, and also used in
the study of Schulze et al. [201]. Glass particles in the size of
71(cid:1)105 mm are injected in a lab-scale methane combustor. Particles
are then collected on a steel tube maintained at 500 °C with a sur-
rounding gas temperature of 1200 °C. The simulation shows ade-
quate results and the authors recommend this model.

Wall et al. [414] compared literature data on the critical velocity
below which the particle will adhere to the surface. The critical
velocity strongly depends on the particle size, and increases with
decreasing particle diameter. Different material combinations yield
different slopes, ranging from ¡0.39 to ¡6.11 as shown in Fig. 61.
Dong et al. [420] determined the critical velocity of fly ash particles
on stainless steel, however, only at room temperatures. Their data
show a strong dependence on the diameter with the highest slopes.
A difficulty is the inhomogeneity in fly ash, where particles are not
perfectly spherical and differ in chemistry. The authors report that
the majority of fly ash particles is composed of quartz and mullite
[420]. This data should be extended to higher temperatures, where
the ash softens, and impact behavior changes. There is currently no
theory incorporating all energies involved during impact and
rebound, and thus being able to predict different rebound behavior
shown in Fig. 61. Table 16 summarizes major experiment using solid
particles impacting on a solid substrate. Typically, this data is used
to set up and validate models including elastic and plastic deforma-
tion effects. Table 16 focuses on particle impaction studies with
diameters and velocity values relevant for ash deposition. Again,
studies using high temperatures are not available. Furthermore, the
majority uses exotic materials, mostly polymers or metals, with lim-
ited application to ash deposition.

Brach and Dunn [428] derived a mathematical model for the
impaction of micrometer-sized spheres, at moderate velocities and
arbitrary angles of impaction on a flat substrate. According to the
authors, the model can be applied for solids, for spheres in the tran-
sition regime between solid and liquid (i.e. viscoelastic, elastic-plas-
tic), and other materials or combinations. Assumptions of this
model, are that the processes of adhesion and material deforma-
tion, are independent of each other. They argue that energy loss
due to adhesion only occurs during rebound [428]. The model is
validated using experimental data from the impaction of ammo-
nium fluorescein spheres against a molybdenum surface. The model
is based on Newton’s law, the conservation of momentum, and
given by:

however, they can be incorporated. Another, external force might be
caused by thermophoresis, which is not included in this study or
any other study. By using expressions for the individual terms in

Konstandopoulos [429] examined literature data on experiments
on non-normal impact and concluded the existence of a critical
impact angle ’p,crit. Below this angle, particles will rebound even if

Konstandopoulos [429] furthermore investigated literature data on
the maximum angle of deposition Qmax,dep as depicted in Fig. 62. He
showed that the critical angle along the cylinder circumference Qcrit
obtained when vp,n (cid:2) vp,crit, is not the limiting angle until which par-
ticles will stick. The maximum angle observed in experiments is
obtained by using particle trajectory calculations and Eq. (86).
Experimental results are from the work of Aylor and Ferrandino
[432], who studied the deposition of 15 - 30 mm pollen (ragweed
and lycopodium) on glass rods of 3 - 10 mm diameter, and the work
of Wang and John [419], who applied monodisperse ammonium flu-
orescin particles with a size range of 3.35 - 20 mm on stainless steel
cylinders of 1.6 and 3.2 mm diameter. The data is illustrated in
Fig. 62(b), showing the maximum deposition angle, as a function of
the Stokes number. It can be seen that the angle to which particles

Xcirt since the particle

ratio is known to depend on the physical and material properties of
the particle-surface combination [429] as given by Eq. (86). In order
to calculate the critical angle ’p,crit using Eq. (86), the ratio (E*/G*),
m* and b are needed. The ratio (E*/G*) is only a function of the Pois-
sion’s ratio n, and typical values are about 2.1(cid:1)2.2 [429]. The data
shown in Fig. 62(b) can be applied to estimate the parameter b (cid:5)
0:09 (cid:1) 0:15 with f 1⁄4 0:2 (cid:1) 0:3 for the material pair of Wang and
John [419].

A similar approach was developed by Rosner and Tandon [433],
in order to describe particle deposition rates for a cylindrical target
in a dust-laden stream. A model is presented for dry, granular depos-
its, where the fraction sticking is described with [433,434]:

This model uses equations with an exponential decay for particles
above the critical velocity. It could be shown that only smaller par-
ticles are able to stick to the target/tube. However, an validation
with experiments is missing. Further interesting models are pre-
sented by Hærvig et al. [474] and Chen et al [541].

4.3.2. Liquid droplet impacting a solid smooth surface

The impaction of

liquid droplets on a solid surface has
been investigated in a large number of studies, often in the

field of internal combustion engines, aiming at the deposition of
fuel droplets on walls [436(cid:1)438],
fundamental studies using
water or alcohol droplets impacting on various solid surfaces
[390,435,439(cid:1)444], or, spray coating [445]. Most studies are used
to develop mechanistic or semi-empirical models describing the
impaction process for variable droplet sizes, viscosities, surface
tensions at different impaction angles and speeds. Fig. 63 shows
the stages of a low viscosity droplet such as water impacting on a
flat solid surface. The schematic is based on the work of Chandra
and Avedisian [435], who used a camera system in order to
record different stages of droplet impaction and deformation. Par-
ticle or droplet impaction on a solid substrate can be divided into
six consecutive stages. Fig. 63 illustrates different stages for a low
viscosity liquid. The incoming particle of size dp and impact veloc-
ity vp starts to wet the substrate during stage “1”. This process is
strongly dependent on the contact angle Qc between the surface
and the droplet, which depends on liquid properties and surface
characteristics. Young’s equation given by Eq. (52) can be used to
relate the contact angle to the surface tension and surface energy.
At stage “2”, the maximum spread diameter dp,max is reached and
the kinetic energy approaches zero. At this point, the droplet
height finds its minimum hp,min. During the next two stages, the
droplet starts to deform back to a sphere and oscillate, forming
the maximum height at stage “4”. At stage “5” the droplet either
rebounds or sticks, depending on energy dissipation during previ-
ous stages. For a low viscosity droplet the sticking probability is
quite high due to large deformations. However, splashing is
untypical for ash particles since viscosity is still high compared to
liquids such as water or gasoline.

temperatures. Splashing behavior is commonly reported at very
high Weber numbers, independent of the substrate temperature. A
regime map for ash particle deposition has to consider supercooled
liquids instead. Molten particles can solidify in the boundary layer,
depending on the particle velocity and boundary layer thickness.
Typically, a 20 mm particle with 15 m/s (St (cid:5) 1 for a superheater
tube with diameter 30 mm) is the threshold. Larger particles are
unaffected and no deceleration and cooling occurs inside the bound-
ary layer, as estimated by Walsh et al. [395] and predicted using CFD
(around 30 mm particle with 6.8 m/s was the threshold [188]). This
behavior inside the boundary layer can be significant for small par-
ticles. Therefore, the applicability of a regime map without consider-
ing cooling effects is doubtful. A summary on major experimental
droplet impaction studies is given in Table 17. Most investigations
use relatively large droplets, with low viscosity values, compared to
ash particles. Nevertheless, the experiments are valuable for the
development of sticking and rebound models. There are some stud-
(cid:3)
Slan(cid:3)ciauskas and
ies, such as Chandra and Avedisian [435] or
Kalpokait _e [437] using high viscosity fluids with relevant properties.
Pasandideh-Fard et al. [441] studied the impaction of liquid drop-
lets on solid surfaces using experimental and numerical methods.
Impacting water droplets were photographed, and maximum spread
diameters and contact angles, were obtained from these images. The
droplet diameter was around dp (cid:5) 2 mm and the impact velocity
was vp;i 1⁄4 1 m/s [441]. The authors derive correlations for the maxi-
mum droplet diameter after impaction dp,max (defined in Fig. 63 or
58). After impaction, the droplet deforms, and loses its circular
shape, forming a thin film on the substrate, as shown in stage 2,
within Fig. 63. This deformation process is described using energy
conservation as given in Eq. (74). The authors show that the ratio of
maximum spread diameter dp,max to initial droplet diameter dp can
be calculated by:

using the droplet viscosity in contrast to Eq. (12), where the viscosity

Rein [448] subdivided experimental investigations in the follow-
ing main groups [440]: impaction on heated surfaces with tempera-
tures above the evaporation temperature of the fluid, impaction on
cold surfaces, and impaction on liquid films (see e.g. review of Yarin
[449]). This differentiation is used to establish regime maps, as
shown in Fig. 64. The droplet Weber number is used in combination
with the substrate temperature in order to differentiate between a
sticking, rebound and splash regime. The Weber number is defined
as the ratio of droplet kinetic energy to surface energy using the fol-
lowing expression [441]:

At low Weber numbers and temperatures below the boiling point
TBP, the droplet will stick due to its low kinetic energy, which is
the behavior
completely dissipated during collision. However,
changes at high surface temperatures, where a vapor film between
the droplet and the surface prevents the droplet from wetting and
deformation. In this case, rebound is reported [446]. A study of Bai
and Gosman [447] further differentiated into break-up, splash and
rebound with break-up regimes depending on further characteristic

relative velocity between the droplet and the gas flow or the abso-
lute velocity has to be used; however, the latter seems more appro-
priate. Mao et al. [390] conducted similar experiments, and studied
the impaction of droplets composed of a water-surcose mixture on
glass, steel or paraffin substrates. Studied droplets had diameters of
1.5 < dp (cid:2) 3.5 mm and velocities in the range of 0.5 < vp (cid:2) 6 m/s. The
authors used a similar energy-based approach as Pasandideh-Fard
et al. [441], but with a changed formulation for the surface energy at
the contact. They derive the following implicit formulation of ξD

Mao et al. [390] compared the solution of Eq. (93) with measure-
ments and found a maximum deviation of 10%. They observed the
formation of a ring after maximum spread, which then contracts
towards its center forming a conical droplet, and separates from the
substrate. The droplet rebounds, if the energy dissipated due to vis-
cous forces and the work of adhesion is higher than the surface
energy after impaction. The authors use a parameter called excess
rebound energy EERE in order to estimate the rebound behavior of
droplets. The droplet will stick (pstick 1⁄4 1) if EERE (cid:2) 0 and rebound
otherwise (pstick 1⁄4 0) [390]:

affected if the substrate temperature is below the melting tempera-
ture of the droplet. Deformation and maximum spread dp,max are

the droplet Tm, the wall temperature TW, and the latent heat of fusion

and defined as Pe 1⁄4 vp ¢ dp ¢ rp
¢ cp;p=kp [451]. Eq. (96) simplifies to
Eq. (92) if there is no temperature difference between the droplet and
the substrate (s*1⁄40). Ni et al. [333] used the findings of Aziz and Chan-
dra [451] and applied the given equations for a sticking criterion in
slag-flow gasification systems. However, there is no validation of the
model. They carried out parameter studies for relatively large ash par-
ticles, and used the viscosity model of Browning et al. [314] as well as
measurements of the apparent contact angle of Abbot and Austin
[350]. Their parameter study showed versatile behavior. Generally,
the sticking probability increases with increasing temperature. Stick-
ing was also be found for small particles with low velocities
(dp (cid:7) 1 mm and vp (cid:7) 1 m/s) and large particles with relatively high
impact velocities (dp > 3 mm and vp > 3 m/s) [333].

4.4. Evaluation of sticking criteria

A simple comparison of presented sticking criteria is shown in
Table 18. It can be seen that sticking criteria are in agreement on
the effect of individual parameters, such as changing particle tem-
perature, diameter, velocity or angle of impaction. Generally, the
probability of an ash particle to stick to a heat exchanging surface is
high for small particles with high temperatures, which impact with
a low velocity and small impaction angle. However, the role of the
impact angle is barely understood, mainly due to the scarcity of
measurements and the fact of contradictory models and experimen-
tal results [428,429]. The models presented in Table 18 require a
number of temperature- and composition-dependent properties.
One can imagine that with a higher number of parameters, it is more
difficult to use such a model. Therefore, simple correlations and
equations are favorable over complex models, such as the one of
Thornton and Ning [290]. The biggest challenge is to find tempera-
ture-dependent properties for different ash particle compositions
and structures.

4.5. Role of existing deposit layers and limitations

Most of the sticking criteria described above are developed for a
clean, often flat surface with well-defined properties. For such a sur-
face, particle impaction and sticking rates can be predicted, such as
the ones shown in Fig. 65(a). Walsh et al. [460] calculated the stick-
ing probability for sodium sulfate-coated calcium aluminosilicate
particles and found a narrow range of sizes around 10(cid:1)15 mm,
which is able to deposit. Particles smaller than 10 mm did not impact
on the surface since diffusional effects and thermophoresis are not
considered. On the other hand, large particles did not stick, which
goes along with the sensitivity study shown in Table 18. The sticking
probability decreases with increasing particle size. In comparison to
a clean surface, there are a number of changes for heat exchanging
surfaces in a power plant. Sticking criteria are typically missing
effects such as surface roughness or stickiness of the substrate. Once
there is a deposit layer (powdery, sintered or molten) the sticking

tendency changes due to changed surface properties. This is particu-
larly challenging when describing the deposit build-up. Fig. 65(b)
illustrates the process of deposit formation. A clean tube collects
only sticky particles, which then solidify as long as the layer is thin
[395]. With an increasing deposit layer, the surface temperature
increases becoming sticky itself, causing an increase in collection
efficiency. Non-molten, dry ash particles can adhere to a sticky sur-
face. The viscosity approach of Walsh et al. [395], is one of the few
approaches considering the stickiness of the surface. They use the
following equation to describe the net mass fraction sticking to the
surface pstick,tot:

where the particle and wall sticking probabilities are calculated,
using Eq. (71). The viscosity in Eq. (71), can be calculated using the
corresponding particle and wall temperature in combination with
the chemical composition. The parameter ke describes the erosivity
of the dry ash particles towards the deposit. The overall deposit

This expression is however only valid if sintering or changes in
deposit strength do not occur [395]. Further investigations of par-
ticles impacting a powdery or liquid layer are discussed inD
X Sec-
tion 5.3, dealing with the particle rebound. Another very critical
factor is the heterogeneity of ash particles. Often sticking criteria use
bulk ash chemistry to calculate deposition rates. An individual treat-
ment on a particle-by-particle basis is essential. A low melting iron-
sulfide particle might stick at temperatures as low as 1000 °C,
whereas a quartz particle needs temperatures above 1600 °C. How-
ever, finding temperature-dependent properties for all possible
impossible.
chemical compositions of ash particles is rather

Therefore, due to the large diversity of ash particles in terms of
chemical composition, size, density and shape, it is straightforward
to use simple sticking criteria, without the need of knowing all parti-
cle and wall properties, e.g. Young’s modulus, Poisson’s ratio, contact
angle or viscosity.

4.6. Parameters affecting the stickiness and rebound behavior

Most ash particle sticking criteria are based on ideal conditions,
when spherical particles or droplets impact on a flat solid surface.
However, within solid fuel-fired boilers different and much more
complex scenarios can occur. Fig. 66 summarizes a number of possi-
ble phenomena. Ash particles can be trapped by a molten sticky
layer, as outlined in the previous section. Furthermore, a solid, pow-
dery deposit can act as a filter element for particles. The flow might
be able to penetrate the inside of the deposit, however, the par-
ticles are not. They are collected by the porous structure. Condensa-
tion and/or chemical reactions of alkali vapors with fly ash particles
can change the stickiness as found by Wibberley and Wall [406]. A
thin, low viscosity layer forms around silicate ash particles and
allows particles to deposit on a cooled steel surface (600 °C) free
from condensed material [406]. Another mechanisms is the cemen-
tation of solid fly ash particles. Particles impacting on the surface
are followed by a molten droplet acting as a glue between the sur-
face and the fly ash particle. This mechanism, however, is difficult
to verify in experiments. A further interesting aspect is the deposi-
tion of unburnt char containing molten and/or solid ash grains. The
remaining char will oxidize and ash remains on the heat exchang-
ing surface. This mechanisms is mainly reported for entrained flow
gasifier. Another phenomena could be the sintering and reaction of
particles during the contact. However, experimental evidence is
again missing.

XRarely discussed is the deposition of agglomerates or thermal
effects at the interface as shown by the last two mechanisms. The
ash particle shape is often ignored in literature. Fly ash particles are
commonly irregular formed agglomerates with different impaction,
and deformation behavior. An agglomerate is able to dissipate
kinetic energy by rearrangement of its structure and therefore its
sticking probability might be higher compared with spherical par-
ticles of the same size. Furthermore, its impact velocity is lower
compared with a spherical particle at the same flow conditions due
to its high surface to volume ratio and thus its high drag coefficient.
XAn aspect that misses in Fig. 66 is the formation of a scale and/or
oxide layer. The dynamics of oxide layer formation are illustrated in
Fig. 67. The following steps are reported [66]:

[461]).

Step 1: The formation of a thin, initial oxide layer due to oxidation. It
is expected that ash particles do not play a significant role
here. However, the presence of gaseous chlorine or SO2/SO3
significantly increases the rate of layer formation.

Step 2: In the following step, the oxide layers starts to grow due to
the higher diffusion rate of iron compared with chromium
and nickel. Alkali chloride or alkali sulfate vapors begin to
condense on the oxide layer. Reactions between Cl/S and the
oxide layer further increase the growth and porosity, where
the porosity might be caused by the release of volatile metal
chlorides. Furthermore, it was found that an increasing K-
content in the ash leads to a strong increase in oxide layer
thickness, as shown in the SEM images (c)(cid:1)(e) in Fig. 67.

Step 3 and 4: Cracks and gaps form in the oxide layer, as shown in
Fig. 67(b). Detachment can occur due to thermal stresses or
growth stresses between different layers. An increase in sur-
face temperature leads to an accelerated particle collection
promoting ash deposition. The temperature increase is
caused by the insulating oxide layer and/or by detachment
and insulating gas between oxide layers. Higher ash accumu-
lation rates increase the chlorine content in the deposit
enhancing corrosion rate.

Depending on the chemical bonding between the interfaces,
oxide layers might detach, and existing deposits and oxide layers are
removed, leading to a repetition in the above-mentioned steps [66].

The oxide layer formation is often neglected, or not mentioned when
studying ash deposition, however, it can play an important role. It is
essential to estimate and know relevant mechanisms, when devel-
oping an ash particle sticking and rebound criterion. A comparison
of parameters and their ranges, as well as energies involved during
particle impact are presented in Table 19. Three different scenarios
are compared:

(cid:3) First, the deposition of a small, sub-micron, salt-rich ash particle
formed by inorganic vapor condensation. This particle slows
down drastically inside the boundary layer and migrates with a
very small velocity magnitude to the surface. The particle tem-
perature is identical to the superheater tube during impact.

(cid:3) Second, the deposition of a large, massive Fe-rich particle. The
particle originates from pyrite and forms a low melting eutectic

For all three particles, a normal impact, at the front face of a cyl-
inder (superheater tube with diameter of 30 mm), is assumed. Parti-
cle properties are estimated using equations from Section 3, or taken
from literature. The particle viscosity shows the largest deviation.
The sub-micron particle is solid with a relatively high, estimated
value of mp (cid:5) 1012 PaD
Xs, compared to the very low value of
mp (cid:5) 10(cid:1)2 PaD
Xs for the Fe-rich particle. The variation in surface ten-
sion is low as long as particles are liquid. In the case of solid particles,
surface energy values have to be used. Using these values, energy
ranges can be calculated. The particle kinetic energy for instance
spans over 17 orders of magnitude. All calculated energy values are
illustrated in Fig. 69. The calculation of a potential energy is ques-
tionable since particles do not drop from a certain height, instead,
they are entrained in the flow. However, it is shown that potential
energy is orders of magnitude smaller, compared to other energy
values and thus negligible. The energy loss caused by frictional
forces can be estimated using the following relation:
Efri;p 1⁄4 (cid:1)f ¢ F ¢ ξ ¢ dp

ð101Þ

where f is the friction coefficient, F is the net force acting on a settled
particle, and ξ ¢ dp is the contact diameter between the ash particle
and the substrate. The net force F can be a combination of forces act-
ing at the interface, as illustrated in Fig. 59. Depending on this force,
the friction coefficient can differ quite significantly, however, it is
relatively small compared to the particle kinetic energy. The estima-

tion of energy losses due to van der Waals forces is difficult. Van der
Waal forces are known as the non-covalent interaction between
atoms or molecules at interfaces. Fig. 68(a) shows how momentary
dipols form at the interface due to random movement of electrons.
The majority of particles carry a small net charge that will lead to an
attractive force to an opposing charge found at surfaces. The dipoles
and resulting forces contribute to particle adhesion alongside with
surface tension effects and electrostatic forces [158,244]. Fig. 68(b)
shows the impact of rough surfaces on a microscopic scale. There
are only few contact points and contact surface area is reduced.
The van der Waal energy can be viewed as the work/energy required
to separate two bodies in contact, without other forces such as
adhesion, gravity. The energy due to van der Waals forces between
a sphere and a wall can be calculated according to the following
equation [462,463]:

EvdW;p 1⁄4 AH ¢

dp
12 ¢ D

;

ð102Þ

where AH is the Hamaker constant set to a value of AH 1⁄4 7 ¢ 10(cid:1)20 J
and D is the distance between the particle surface and the wall as
shown in Fig. 68(b). This distance is difficult to estimate. If two per-
fectly smooth bodies are in contact, their distance might be in the
range of D (cid:5) 0.2 nm. However, most ash particles are not perfectly
smooth, leading to much higher values of D (cid:5) 10 nm [463]. Eq. (102)
predicts considerably higher energy values due to van der Waals
forces, compared to friction and potential energy. Values are slightly
lower, compared with adhesion energy. The adhesion energy of a
particle in contact with a substrate is calculated using Eq. (141),
introduced later on. The contact area and the contact angle between
the deformed particle and the surface are crucial. By far the highest
energy losses are due to particle deformation no matter if the parti-
cle is solid or liquid. In Table 19 it is assumed that the small salt-rich
particle has an extrapolated, high viscosity. The work against viscos-
ity required to deform the particle to the predicted spread factor ξ

can be as high as its kinetic energy. In this case, all energy is dissi-
pated, and the particle will stick if the connectivity between the sub-
strate and the particle surface is high enough to overcome shear
forces, caused by the flow. The error in predicting the deformation
energy for small, high viscosity particles is expected to be high, and
future research should be directed towards this issue. A further
mechanisms which might be of relevance is the thermal expansion
coefficient, which can vary with temperature and material. Thermal
stresses at the interface can occur leading to a detachment and re-
entrainment of a fly ash particle. The sticking probability can be
judged using Table 19. When the energy loss due to deformation,
adhesion and van der Waals forces exceed the kinetic and potential
energy, the particle will stick. Comparing all three cases, surprising
results can be observed. The small, salt-rich particles and Al-Si parti-
cle stick, whereas the large,
low viscosity, Fe-rich particle will
rebound. The small particle sticks since it has an almost negligible
kinetic energy, which is completely dissipated during impact. Each
of the following components adhesion, deformation and van der
Waals forces are large enough to cause deposition/sticking. In the
case of the Al-Si, the deformation and thus, the work against viscos-
ity, leads to the sticking behavior. On the contrary, the kinetic energy
of the Fe-rich particle is too high and cannot be completely dissi-
pated even though the deformation is high (ξ > 2).

Table 19, further gives dimensionless numbers. The Stokes num-
ber in a power plant can range from extremely low values of St (cid:5)
10(cid:1)9 up to St (cid:5) 60. Inertial impaction becomes dominant at around
St (cid:5) 0.5, which is in the region of a 20 mm particle (see Fig. 26). The
Knudsen number ranges from low values for large particles to high
values for the sub-micron particle. Thus, sub-micron particles do not
follow the Stokes drag law and the thermal conductivity ratio does
not influence thermophoretic force. The particle Reynolds number
¢ vp ¢ dp=mp) and Weber number also span over more than
(Rep 1⁄4 rp
ten orders of magnitude. This huge spread is the main problem for
finding generally valid correlations. It can be seen that the particle
spread factor can differ significantly for small particles when using
different correlations. The correlation of Mao et al. [390] predicts
higher spread factors and thus higher dissipation rates compared
with correlations suggested by Chandra and Avedisian [435].

4.7. Sticking behavior of aerosols

Experimental studies dealing with aerosol impaction and deposi-
tion are rare. The main difficulty is the small particle size. Particles
are difficult to handle and not visible with standard optical devices
such as camera systems. Most of the work is theoretical in nature
and uses models to predict aerosol sticking. Often it is assumed that
every aerosol that impacts on a wall will stick. The common believe
is that they are kept along surfaces by relatively weak van der Waal
and electrical forces. However, experimental evidence is still due. A

lot of work on aerosol deposition was conducted in the filtration
industry, e.g. the work of Wang and Kasper [467]. They compare the
critical velocity with typical particle impact velocities and derive laws
and models for the filtration efficiency. According to their study, the
mean particle impact velocity for the diffusion-dominated particle
impaction regime is characterized by its thermal velocity following
the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution analogously to Eq. (14):

The parameter e stands for the restitution coefficient, which will be
introduced later on in Section 5. For nano-particles or molecules, the
coefficient of restitution is commonly assumed to be unity, hence a
perfectly elastic collision without energy losses [467]. When using
Eq. (104), an expression for the adhesion energy is needed. One
approach goes back to the work of Bradley [475] and Hamaker [462],
referred to as the Bradley(cid:1)Hamaker adhesion energy. It integrates
all molecular attractions over the entire volume. Substituting their
expression in Eq. (104), leads to the following expression:

where AH is again the Hamaker constant and D the minimum separa-
tion between particle surface and wall. The main drawback of the B-
H theory is that it assumes point contact between the particle and
wall, where in reality a finite contact area forms [467]. Another com-
monly used model, which overcomes this shortcoming, goes back to
the JKR model [431]. The JKR theory calculates the critical velocity

[476], who studied the effect of contact deformations on the adhe-
sion of particles and reported that the adhesion energy is equivalent
to the first power of the particle diameter. The same dependency is
predicted when using Eq. (105). Slightly different is Eq. (106), where
the critical velocity varies with d5=6
. A comparison of different equa-
p
tions is shown in Fig. 70. It can be seen that both models predict

impact velocity vimp, which increases strongly as the particle size

sols are much larger, with sizes around 100-300 nm, it is confirmed
that these particle will stick no matter of bulk flow conditions or
temperatures. However, a recent experimental study reported a dif-
ferent behavior for nanoparticles. Rennecke and Weber [468] used
for the first time a low pressure impactor in order to determine the
critical velocity of nanometer-sized NaCl and Ag particles on a mica
substrate, avoiding contact charging. The authors used the JKR the-
ory assuming full plastic failure of the particle during the approach
regime, adhesion during particle rebound and constant hardness as
well as constant surface energy during collision. With these assump-
tions Weir and McGavin [469] derived the following equation:

where g is the surface energy. Parameters for Eq. (107) can be found
in Table 20D
X. Rennecke and Weber [468] found a relatively steep
curve for the particle critical velocity, which implies that particles
around 50 nm rebound above velocities much smaller than pre-
dicted by the JKR and B-H model. They further showed a relatively
high critical velocity for porous NaCl particles compared with dense
NaCl particles. This is useful information for aerosols, which are typi-
cally agglomerates, and thus, also porous. Hence, it is assumed that
agglomerates dissipate much kinetic energy during collision due to
deformation and rearrangement and, thus, have a high sticking
probability. It was further predicted that very small particles experi-
ence plastic deformation, which is in contradiction to previous stud-
ies assuming that aerosols impact perfectly elastic. There are many
unknown phenomena and to date there are only few experiments in
this area. Further studies should focus on a combination of experi-
mental work and new modeling approaches, such as improved theo-
ries implementing a reduced particle stiffness [474]. The goal should

be a comprehensive model being able to predict nanoparticle stick-
ing and rebound.

Two important characteristics for aerosol deposition on heat
exchanging surfaces are illustrated in Fig. 71. Fig. 71(a) shows the
effect of a porous deposit layer collecting all incoming particles. If
particles are small, inertia is low and the probability of shedding
diminishes. All incoming particles are collected no matter if they are
sticky or not. A second important parameter is the particle shape. As
illustrated in Fig. 71(b) agglomerates impact on a wall, deform and
rearrange their structure. It is assumed that a large fraction of the
particle kinetic energy is dissipated during this process, leading to
an increased sticking efficiency of agglomerates compared with per-
fectly spherical ash particles. However, further work in this field is
needed.

Further frequently cited aerosol deposition models can be found
in health studies dealing with particle deposition in the respiratory
tract. Typical particle capture efficiencies as a function of particle
size can be seen in Fig. 72. These models incorporate particle impac-
tion and sticking efficiency in the form of the capture efficiency. It
can be seen that very small and coarse particles are captured within
the respiratory tract, whereas only 20(cid:1)30% of particles with a size of
around 400 nm reach the surface and stick. The capture efficiency
depends on the breathing frequency and the tidal volume, and thus,
the channel diameter. Various, mostly empirical models have been
developed and used to validate experimental results. Predictions
show that only smallest particles are able to travel down to the alve-
olar, whereas larger particles deposit much earlier in the bronchial
and extrathoracic tract. In general, an increased capture efficiency is
observed for a larger tidal volume, probably caused by lower veloci-
ties and increased residence times. The application of health models
for ash deposition studies is questionable. Physics of both, particles
and deposition surface are quite different. Furthermore, they are
based on an internal flow problem, compared with an external flow
around tubes and along walls within a power plant.

In general, aerosol deposition behavior is relatively unknown.
Only few experimental studies can be found and their applicability
to boilers is questionable. The role of higher temperatures and rough
surfaces might change the deposition process significantly. Further-
more, strong temperature gradients lead to an increased deposition
velocity, as shown and discussed in Section 2.5.2. More or less

particle transport towards the laminar sublayer. Only particles with
high velocities are able to penetrate through this layer. However,
this velocity has to be estimated and leads to high uncertainties.
Baxter and DeSollar [13] developed the standalone code ADLVIC,
which includes inertial impaction, thermophoresis, condensation,
chemical reactions and uses bulk ash composition in order to predict
the deposit chemistry. A good agreement with measurements is
reported. Further standalone tools are included in the “Fuel Quality
Advisor” developed at the Electric Power Reasearch Institute (EPRI).
They include FOULER and SLAGGO, which have several submodels
for ash formation, mineral transformation, and ash deposition. They
predict the heat penalty caused by deposits. A similar code is devel-
oped at the University of North Dakota called LEADER predicting
fouling propensities inside a boiler [57]. An inclusion of these or
other sophisticated models in a CFD code enables the prediction of
fuel conversion, slagging and fouling locations, their extent, and the
optimization of operation or design. However, the incorporation of
such standalone models into CFD codes is lacking behind [70]. Often
too simple models are used, which may lead to wrong conclusions. A
comprehensive overview of CFD studies on industrial boilers or
pilot-scale test-rigs, is given in Table 21. Most studies on predicting
ash deposition can be found for PF systems. There are some studies
dealing with grate and FB combustion, however, modeling the com-
bustion and ash formation process in fixed or moving beds is chal-
lenging. An overview on CFD studies dealing with FB can be found in
the work of Singh et al. [479].

Among the pioneers in using CFD codes for the prediction of slag-
ging and fouling are the studies of Boysan et al. [398], who calculated
the rate of char impacting on walls, Richards et al. [408], and Wang
and Harb [480]. Both of the latter two studies used the PCGC code,
developed at the Brigham Young University. Richards et al. [408]
applied two-dimensional simulations for a 1 MWth test facility to
calculate deposition rates. A first three-dimensional model was
applied for a PF boiler, by Wang and Harb [480]. The PCGC code uses
a different particle treatment compared with Lagrangian tracking,
where particle clouds and their transport are calculated instead of
individual tracks. Particle impaction and deposition rates are esti-
mated based on particle concentrations near the walls. The authors
use the viscosity concept of Walsh et al. [395] to calculate the depo-
sition of a representative number of particles. The positions, at
which slagging and fouling rates were predicted inside a boiler,
were reduced to approximately 100(cid:1)200 [480] and deposition rates
were interpolated in between. Pseudo-transient calculations are
used to account for deposit stickiness. A highlight is the use of
CCSEM data, which enables the prediction of deposit chemistry.
Many of today’s CFD studies are still not able to predict chemistry
and do not consider individual particle composition.

Lee and Lockwood [492] studied ash deposition of three British
coals in a small combustion test rig using the CFD code CINAR. They
use CCSEM data to predict fly ash composition in a pre-processor. A
specified number of particle size classes and chemistry classes are
used. This enables the prediction of deposit chemistry. Lee and Lock-
wood [492] used a critical velocity and viscosity approach. Particles
with a velocity higher than the critical value are able to reach the
wall. In the next step the viscosity decides whether a particle sticks
or not. An increased iron deposition was found for early stages,
whereas in later stages, the deposit composition was similar to the
fly ash.

Bo(cid:3)zic̀ [184] used the code FLOREAN of University of Braunsch-
weig to predict mineral transformation and deposition. He used a
post-processor and included 50 mineral matter transformation pro-
cesses, in which chemical reactions and their kinetics, diffusion limi-
tations, fusion, crystal and glass formation are incorporated. This
process is highly complex, but enables studying the role of atmo-
sphere and time on ash deposition. This model was further used and
improved by Strelow [488]. Both report a relatively good agreement

unknown is the role and effect of electrostatic forces during impac-
tion on heat exchangers in solid fuel fired boilers. Further work is
needed in particular for aerosols and agglomerates at high tempera-
tures. In addition, studies should focus on how aerosols affect the
deposit formation and consolidation over time.

4.8. Overview on modeling studies

Modeling solid fuel combustion, ash formation and deposition
started using one-dimensional stand-alone tools. There are various
studies reporting good agreement of ash formation models with
measurements, such as the work of Kang et al. [477,478], who calcu-
lated time-dependent char combustion and coalescence of ash
grains with a cluster composed of char and ash sites. In this model,
oxidation leads to particle shrinkage and partial coalescence of ash
or char fragmentation. Monroe [23] studied ash formation at the
MIT and developed a stand-alone tool based on Monte Carlo simula-
tions of single coal particles for the prediction of ash formation. An
interesting work was proposed by Charon et al. [85] and Barta et al.
[72], the so-called “urn”-model, as mentioned earlier. This model
enables the prediction of ash PSD and chemistry, simultaneously. A
number of eleven mineral classes is used, which might be too low in
order to predict the vast variance among fly ash particles, and their
chemistry. Nevertheless, the approach is promising. Another high-
light is the work of Wilemski and Srinivasachar [104], who used a
scaled Monte Carlo simulation for mineral distribution. Char conver-
sion includes a fragmentation model and considers different char
structures. Good agreement for a bituminous coal
is reported,
whereas a second coal fails. The authors underline the importance of
knowledge on the non-random mineral distribution and char struc-
ture. In general, most of the above mentioned stand-alone models
report relatively good agreement with measured particle size distri-
bution. These fundamental models are much more sophisticated
compared with current CFD methods. Models predicting both, ash
PSD and chemistry, are rare and require in-depth fuel characteriza-
tion methods. Early deposition models used an Eulerian approach
and go back to Friedlander and Johnstone [217]. In this model, there
is no slip between the gas flow and the particle velocity. The concen-
tration of particles in the flow parallel to the wall, is used to estimate
a deposition rate. It is assumed that turbulent diffusion leads to

with measurements in test facilities and conducted calculations for
full-scale boilers. An interesting approach is presented by Bernstein
et al. [481], in which they conducted coupled calculations between
the fireside and the water-steam cycle. By using such a method,
more appropriate boundary conditions, in particular temperatures,
can be obtained for the fouling and slagging propensity. However,
complexity increases strongly.

In the early 2000’s, modeling studies for biomass combustion and
ash deposition emerged; mainly in the Scandinavian region.
Pyyk€onenD
X and Jokiniemi [99], developed a condensation model for
the formation of alkali chloride aerosols. The transport of aerosols is
computed using a general dynamic equation in the Eulerian frame of
reference. In this equation, additional velocity components on par-
ticles due to thermophoresis or Brownian diffusion are incorporated
leading to aerosol deposition. Three deposition paths are identified,
which are the formation of sub-micron fume particles in the flow
and their deposition via thermophoresis, the direct condensation of
vapors on heat exchangers, or the nucleation of finest particles in
the boundary layer during cooling and their deposition. Kær [497]
conducted CFD simulations on a straw-fired grate using ANSYS CFX.
In a later study, Fluent was used instead [360]. The simulations
include the release of combustible gases and fly ash particles from a
grate model. The model considers both fine sub-micron particles
similar to Pyyk€onenD
Xand Jokiniemi [99], and coarse fly ash particles.
Melting curves were obtained using thermodynamic equilibrium
calculations and used for an ash particle sticking criterion. Location,
amount and chemistry of ash deposits were predicted and were in-
line with observations during real operation. Lepp€anen et al. [103]
developed a condensation model for the sub-micron particle forma-
tion in a Kraft recovery boiler burning black liquor, a residue of the
paper industry. The modeling included particle dynamics and equi-
librium chemistry for alkali compounds in a full, three-dimensional
CFD model of the boiler. Fine particle transport is modeled using the
Eulerian formulation and deposition is calculated based on a similar
approach as used by Pyyk€onenD
Xand Jokiniemi [99], considering diffu-
sion effects and thermophoresis. The model is partially validated
with measurements from heat exchanging surfaces. The predicted
chemistry of particles extracted from the flue gas agrees well with
model results.

The majority of studies mentioned above estimate the amount
of ash accumulation using the particle concentration near the wall
and the concept of the deposition velocity, e.g. see [360]. The actual
calculation would require a highly resolved boundary layer, and the
exact geometry of thousands of convective heat exchanger tubes.
Single tube studies were conducted by Tomeczek and Wac»awiak
[253], Haugen and Kragset [226], Venturini et al. [496], Weber et al.
[206], P(cid:2)erez et al. [300(cid:1)302]. Typically, all these studies do not
include combustion and ash formation processes. Ash particles are
injected in a small domain, such as the flow around a superheater
tube. Tomeczek and Wac»awiak [253] were among the first to pres-
ent an interesting deposit built-up model accounting for the form-
ing layer. Later on, Weber et al. [206,384] identified an important
and crucial aspect when predicting impaction rates of small

particles. If the boundary layer is not resolved properly by a speci-
fied number of nodes in radial as well as circumferential direction,
impaction rates for small Stokes numbers St < 1 are highly overesti-
mated. This is crucial in particular for predicting the deposition of
particles with small sizes and clean tubes. Furthermore, this effect
can explain relatively high deposition rates predicted by early CFD
studies as shown in Table 7. The group of Weber [206,384] recom-
mends to place at least one node in radial direction within the
displacement thickness and 384 nodes around the cylinder circum-
ference in order to accurately predict particle tracks and deposition
rates. P(cid:2)erez et al. [301,302], who used a highly-resolved grid, stud-
ied the deposition of small ash particles on tubes using unsteady
simulations. They developed a comprehensive energy-based stick-
ing criterion, found time-dependent deposition around the full cir-
cumference of the tubes and vortexes between the tubes affecting
ash deposition. A further model including a dynamic built-up by
grid manipulation was presented [300]. By using this model, they
found that tube arrangement affected vortexes and by this also
deposition rates.

An important question is, how to use information from CFD simu-
lations for practical aspects, such as boiler operation and optimiza-
tion. First of all, if predictions are able to accurately predict locations
of deposit formation, the position of soot-blowers as well as soot-
blowing intervals can be optimized. Furthermore, this allows to
design flow paths as well as the ideal location for the injection of
additives. However, further work in this area is needed, in particular
addressing the role of deposit structure and how to consider this in
advanced CFD models.

4.9. Analogies to other research fields

There are many research areas dealing with similar problems of
particle deposition and fouling. Often, literature from other fields is
ignored and not used. Table 22 summarizes the main research areas,
and highlights their parameters. Related fields of research are the
icing of air crafts, ash deposition in aero-engines caused by volcanic
ash particles, deposition of fine particles or vapors in gas turbines,
spray deposition in internal combustion engines, spray coating, and
aerosol deposition in the human body, such as the respiration tract.
The major differences to other fields are relatively low particle
X combustion
velocities and high viscosity values of ash particles inD
systems. Models from one field do not necessarily work in other
fields, however, often they can be adjusted or extended. Further
fields involve heat exchanger fouling in various industries such as
crude oil, food, desalination, automotive or other processes. A good
overview on heat exchanger fouling is given in the work of M€uller-
Steinhagen and Zettler [498].

5. Ash particle rebound behavior

Theories on the rebound behavior of solid particles on a substrate
are often based on the pioneering work of Hertz [507] and Lord Ray-
leigh [508]. The majority of new models extend the basic theory for

phenomena such as plastic deformation and/or adhesion. Many
studies can be found on the impact mechanics, however the phe-
nomena of sticking and rebound is still poorly understood [414].
Most studies use idealized conditions, with the following assump-
tions [509]:

(cid:3) There is no viscous drag due to a fluid phase between the parti-

cle and the surface,

(cid:3) particles are smooth, non-rotating spheres,
(cid:3) substrate is assumed to be smooth, flat and solid, and
(cid:3) particles approach the surface with an initial kinetic energy
much smaller than the thermal energy required to melt the
particle.

Different stages of the impact of a solid particle with a solid sub-
strate, and their respective energies, are shown in Fig. 73. A particle
of mass mp is colliding with the surface at an impact velocity vi under
an angle ’i (velocity and energy components do not use the index “p”
for particle in order to enhance readability). The tangential velocity
component of an impacting particle vi,t can be responsible for rolling
and sliding events upon impact (stage 2), where the friction coeffi-
cient f between the particle and the surface determines the behavior
during stage 2 [222]. Losses occur during the transformation of the
tangential kinetic particle energy Ekin,t into translational Etr and rota-
tional Erot energy. The losses are caused by friction Efri or due to
work of the rotating particle against the particle adhesion in tangen-
tial direction Ead,t. The normal kinetic energy Ekin,n is responsible for
particle deformation. The deformation subdivides into elastic and
plastic deformation stages. The energy involved during plastic defor-
mation, Epl, is lost in contrast to the energy stored during elastic
deformation, Eel. This energy is left for particle rebound with a parti-
cle velocity vr. Using the energy balance leads to the following
expressions for the impact and rebound kinetic energy [222,510]:

The velocity component in normal direction vr,n depends on Epl and
Ead,n, the components in tangential direction vr,t on the other hand
depend on the Ead,t and Efri [222]. Often, the so-called coefficient of
restitution (COR or e) is used to predict rebound behavior. It is
defined as the ratio of rebound to impact velocity according to the
following expression:

Eq. (111) can also be rearranged for a critical particle velocity vp,crit

The energies given in Eqs. (111) and (112) are all non-linear func-
tions of the particle impact velocity vi [510]. According to Xu and
Willeke [510] these stages divide into primary and secondary elastic
deformation stages. Kinetic energy of an impacting particle is parti-
tioned into energy lost to plastic deformation and energy stored in
primary elastic deformation (before plastic deformation begins) and
secondary elastic deformation of the plastically deformed material.
The individual components in Eq. (112) and their mathematical
description can be found for instance in the work of Xu and Willeke
[510]. The coefficient of restitution depends on the material proper-
ties and kinetic energy of both collision partners. It can be easily
determined by measuring the height loss during a drop experiment
(influence of aerodynamics are often mentioned to be below 5%).
The following thresholds for e are defined:

e 1⁄4 0: perfectly inelastic collision. Objects do not move after colli-
sion. Example: water droplet on large surface, where all kinetic
energy is dissipated during deformation.

X1: real solid body collision: Realistic collisions, where the
exact value depends on the material properties, the flow conditions
and the impact energy. Example: ping pong ball rebounds on a table
with around e (cid:5) 0:7 (cid:1) 0:85 depending on the drop height, and table/
ball properties.

e 1⁄4 1: perfectly elastic collision: No losses occur during impact.
This is a theoretical case, which does not occur in reality. Values
greater than unity gain energy, e.g. due to detonations or chemical
phenomena.

Continuous lines are fitted using the energy balance equation (figures reproduced from Wall et al. [414]).

critical particle velocity was found to depend on the impact angle
[419] and on the particle size [414]. The study of Wang and John
[419] showed that at constant impact velocity vi and with decreasing
impact angle ’i, the critical velocity vp,crit decreased. Wall et al. [414]
conducted a large number of experiments on the collision of differ-
ent-sized particles with surfaces. Different material pairs were
investigated by varying both, particle and substrate. The authors
studied the collision over a broad spectrum of particle impact veloci-
ties (1 m/s < vi < 100 m/s). They found a critical particle velocity,
which decreases with increasing particle size. Fig. 74 shows the res-
titution coefficient e, as a function of the impact velocity vi, for a nor-
mal impact experiment. The results are obtained using ammonium
(NH4) fluorescein particles with varying size on molybdenum
(Fig. 74(a)) and tedlar surfaces (Fig. 74(b)). It can be seen that the
critical velocity depends on the particle size and the substrate when
comparing both figures. The softer surface tedlar leads to a larger
critical velocity and lower restitution coefficients. The particles of
size dp 1⁄4 2.58 mm show a critical velocity of around 10 m/s, which
decreases to around 3.8 m/s on a molybdenum substrate. The
rebound velocity strongly increases with increasing impact velocity,
reaching to a uniform value of e (cid:5) 0.8, for all particle sizes. This
behavior is explained by a strong decreasing ratio of Ead/Ekin, i.e. the
relevance of adhesive forces decreases with increasing impact veloc-
ities [222]. Wall et al. [414] furthermore observed a decreasing resti-
tution coefficient at very high impact velocities (vi > 100 m/s). This
is explained by plastic deformation caused when the stress inside
the particle exceeds the material strength.

Often, the restitution coefficient e is measured as a function of the
particle normal impact velocity vi,n. Most studies use a setup with an
B
impact angle of ’i 1⁄4 90
and a camera system, in order to measure
particle velocity and height after rebound. Fig. 75(a) shows measure-
ments on the restitution coefficient e 1⁄4 vn;r=vn;i as a function of the
normal impact velocity vi,n. The data taken from Dunn et al. [424],
was obtained using Ag-coated glass spheres on a stainless-steel sur-
face. Given intervals show the scattering within which 95% of all
data were found. It can be seen that the restitution coefficient
increases with increasing impact velocity until a material-depen-
dent, steady-state value of around e (cid:5) 0.8 is reached. No decrease is
observed indicating that no plastic deformation occurred. Dong et al.
[420] studied the normal rebound behavior of fly ash particles, with
a size of 75 § 5 mm, which were mainly composed of quartz and
mullite. A maximum value of e (cid:5) 0.43 was observed followed by a
decrease at higher impact velocity values. A similar behavior was
found with the same device and material in an accompanying study
as shown in Fig. 75(b). The role of particle size was studied and
higher restitution coefficients were observed for larger particle sizes
probably caused by higher kinetic energy. Interesting is the point
where the restitution coefficient decreases, which is shifted to
higher values when using larger particle sizes. They relate this phe-
nomena to the work needed to break the connection between the
two bodies. A possible explanation for the relatively low values of e
is the particle shape, which was not perfectly spherical.D

Thornton and Ning [290] developed a mathematical description of
the restitution coefficient for adhesive elastic and adhesive elastic-

plastic spheres. In the latter case, plastic deformation occurs after the
particle deforms elastically, as shown in Fig. 73. The model for both
scenarios is based on the theory of Johnson, Kendall and Roberts
[431], commonly known as the JKR-theory. According to this theory,
when two colliding surfaces come into contact, the normal force
between the two bodies drops to a certain value (defined in [290]),
due to van der Waals attractive forces. The velocity of the impacting
sphere is then reduced gradually, accompanied with elastic wave
propagation into the substrate. The incoming (loading) stage is com-
pleted as soon as the contact force reaches the maximum value, and
the velocity reduces to zero. During the recovery stage, the stored
elastic energy is then released and converted into kinetic energy mov-
ing the particle in the opposite direction. The work done during the
loading stage is then recovered, but the particle still remains adhered
to the surface caused by adhesive forces [290]. This idea is used in Eq.
(76), in which Thronton and Ning [290] derive the critical velocity vp,
crit. They rewrite Eq. (76) for the case vi > vp,crit to the following form,

The restitution coefficient for an elastic impact, as a function
of the normalized impact velocity, can be seen in Fig. 76(a). Below
vp;crit =vi 1⁄4 1; a particle will stick. With increasing impact velocity vi
the restitution coefficient approaches a value of unity. In the case

of elastic deformation, the maximum stress distributes as shown
in Fig. 77(a) according to the Hertz theory [507] and Hertz
pressure distribution. In case of plastic deformation, irreversible
deformation occurs and the material strength is exceeded as shown
in Fig. 77(b). Typically, the maximum contact pressure py is
described as py 1⁄4 λ ¢ Y; where Y is the unaxial yield stress of the par-
ticle material (shown in Fig. 40), and λ is a parameter which can vary
from λ 1⁄4 1.59 to 3.20. According to van Beek [267], λ 1⁄4 1.59 is the
limiting case for elastic deformation, and λ 1⁄4 3.20 occurs when the
whole particle deforms plastically [267,301]. A case in between is
shown in Fig. 77(b). The pressure reaches its maximum value in the
region r < rp, where rp is the radius within which plastic deformation
occurs. In the outer part (r > rp but r < rt), elastic deformation is
observed. The total contact radius rt can be used to calculate the con-
tact area between the substrate and the deformed particle. P(cid:2)erez
et al. [301] uses the following linear relation, in order to estimate
the ratio of the area with plastic deformation, and the total contact
area:

adhesive elastic-plastic spheres, however, they did not solve equa-
tions analytically due to their complexity. Instead it was assumed
that the work dissipated due to plastic deformation and the work
dissipated due to adhesive rupture are additive. This simplified the

Wu et al. [513], suggest the following equation for the calculation of
the tangential restitution coefficient:

Eqs. (118)(cid:1)(120) can be used to generate Fig. 76(b), by plotting
the coefficient of restitution against the normalized velocity vi/vy, for
different ratios of vp,crit/vi [290]. At vi=vy 1⁄4 1; plastic deformation
begins and with increasing impact velocity a decrease in the coeffi-
cient of restitution is predicted, as observed in the experiments illus-
trated in Figs. 75(a) and (b), or as shown by the experiments of Wall
et al. [414]. The model of Thornton and Ning [290] yields quite good
results over a wide range, and is therefore often applied. Numerous
models can be found in literature, and it is out of the scope of this
review to discuss them all. Interesting might be for instance the

5.2. Oblique impact and rebound on a solid, smooth surface

In the case of non-normal impact, which is typical for a PF power
plant with superheater tubes, the determination of the restitution
coefficient is more complicated. The rebound angle ’r is not identical
to the impact angle ’i. There are some studies [512,514] reporting
larger rebound angles than impact angles, which seems to be odd at
the first glimpse. The particles seem to gain rebound velocity
vr,n > vi,n [301]. This behavior is explained by surface roughness
effects and becomes important when a particle impacts a fouled
layer. In this case, the angle of rebound can become unpredictable,
showing a probability distribution. During oblique impact, frictional
forces play an important role and have to be considered [512].
Fig. 78 shows definitions of angles, coordinates and the velocity
components. The rebound angle and velocity of spherical particles
depend on [513]:

(cid:3) the impact angle ’i,
(cid:3) the initial impact speed vi,
(cid:3) the particle spin vi,
(cid:3) the normal coefficient of restitution en,
(cid:3) the surface roughness and surface energy of the particle and the

substrate, and

(cid:3) the impulse ratio of incoming and rebounding particle, which

depends on the interface friction coefficient f)D

X.

The restitution coefficient, can be split into the normal and tan-

gential component, according to the following definitions [513]:

An analysis of the tangential coefficient of restitutionD

ducted in a previous study by Wu et al. [515]. They used FEM simula-
tions to predict the tangential restitution coefficientD
X et, as shown
in Fig. 79(b). At low impact angles ’ < 30°, sliding is frequently
reported and dominates [512]. The friction coefficient f is too low to
slow down the particle. At higher impact angles of ’ (cid:3) 30° a value of
et (cid:5) 5/7 is reported to be a good approximation [515]. P(cid:2)erez et al.
[301] used an expression based on the experiments of Brach et al.
[512]. The restitution coefficient is calculated according the follow-
ing expression:

where the angle has to be used in radians. Attention has to be paid
for the definition of the impact angle ’i with the substrate. Different
definitions can be found in literature. A comparison of Eqs. (125)
and (126) with experimental values of Li et al. [516] is shown in
Fig. 79(a). The rebound angle can be calculated using the continuous
line of Fig. 79(b), Eqs. (124) and (125). The result is illustrated in
Fig. 80(a). At low impaction angles, higher rebound angles are pre-
dicted. However, the random distribution of rebound angles cannot
be covered. The random rebound angle, often mentioned in experi-
mental studies, can be explained by Fig. 80(b). The microscopic sur-
face is rough and small particles barely hit the surface at the
macroscopic angle. Therefore, following the suggestion of P(cid:2)erez
et al. [301] to use a probability function to calculate a random
rebound angle, seems meaningful. However, the limit of these angles
should be determined experimentally. P(cid:2)erez et al. [301] suggested
limits between ’r 1⁄4 arcsin (cid:1)vr;n=vr
and ’r 1⁄4 ’i (equations differ in

Tabakoff are presented in Figs. 81(a) and (b). Fig. 81(a) shows the
velocity ratio of incoming and rebounding particles. With decreasing
impact angle, the ratio approaches unity. The trend of mean mea-
sured points is well captured by Eq. (126), however with an offset. In
addition, statistical distributions are shown within the figure for
each measured point. Values are typically found within 20% showing
a Gaussian distribution. Fig. 81(b) illustrates the so-called particle
directional coefficient, which is obtained by dividing the rebound
angle with the impact angle. The rebound angle seems to equal the
impact angle at low impingement angles. However, with increasing
impingement angles, the ratio drops to around 0.6 implying a
reduced rebound angle compared with the impaction angle. A simi-
lar study was performed by Reagle et al. [520] using elevated tem-
peratures (up to 800 °C) and high velocities (up to 102 m/s). The
study uses road dust particles impacting stainless steel surfaces sim-
ulating the deposition of micro-particles under gas turbine condi-
tions. Results indicate that temperature plays a minor role in energy
transfer between particle and impact surface below a critical tem-
perature. At 800 °C, the coefficient of restitution is reduced by an
average of 16% compared with ambient temperature experiments.
Their decrease is explained by an increase in velocity accompanied

by the temperature rise. At higher temperatures reduced elastic
modulus and yield strength are assumed to become relevant. A sum-
mary and overview on experiments aiming at particle deposition in
gas turbines can be found in the work of Hamed and Tabakoff [502].
Particle velocities are considerably higher compared to power plants
and therefore not included in this study. Values range from 65 up to
366 m/s [502]. A recent study dealing with ash and char particle
rebound behavior was presented by Troiano et al. [456]. The authors
studied particle-wall interaction phenomena for entrained flow gas-
ifier using biomass ash and char particles from wood chips and corn
stover. The impaction of particles on inclined hot and cold refractory
material was recorded using a high speed camera. The authors found
that even at ambient temperature, there are indications for plastic
deformation. At high temperatures, there is a drop of the restitution
coefficients in particular for low impact velocities. Typical restitution

within the convective section of a power station such as the econo-
mizer region. An interesting work was presented by van Beek et al.
[268]. They studied the impaction of 50 mm glass particles on a thin
layer of glass particles representing the fouling layer. Ash particles
were simulated using glass spheres. Different scenarios were studied
using a powdery (loose) or glued layer of glass, a varying impact
angle in the range of 60 (cid:2) ’i (cid:2) 90° and varying incident particle
velocities in the range of 0.5 to 1 m/s. Experiments were recorded in
a vacuumed column using a digital camera system [268]. Experi-
mental results were modeled using a two-body collision model
based on the rigid body theory (see Goldsmith [521]). This theory
assumes that deformation during contact is negligible and the
impact is described using linear and angular momentum conserva-
tion. In this theory, only two possible scenario can occur during
rebound: sliding throughout the contact and rolling at exit [268].
Van Beek and co-workers [268] assumed that both the incident par-
ticle and the target particle are initially non-rotating and the target
particle is resting with zero initial velocity. For the sliding-case, the
normal and tangential rebound velocity components of the incident
particle are calculated by [268,521]:

In above equations, mp,1 and mp,2 are the mass of the impacting
and target particle, respectively, and the parameter f denotes
again the Coulomb friction coefficient. The relation given in
Eq. (128) is only valid in the case when the particles remain slid-
ing over each other (’i < 30°). When rolling occurs (slip velocity
is reduced to zero), the rebound velocity of the incident particle
can be calculated by [268]:

As already mentioned above, the normal restitution coefficient en
accounts for the energy loss due to plastic deformation and adhe-
sion. The measured normal restitution coefficient as a function of
impact angle is shown in Fig. 82(a). It can be seen that with increas-
ing angle, the coefficient of restitution increases, to en (cid:5) 0.8 at nor-
mal impact. Van Beek et al. [268] conclude using the theory of
Thornton and Ning [290], that the velocity is too low for plastic
deformation and too high for adhesive forces to become important.
Values agree with the study of Li et al. [516] at high impact angles.
However, the relatively low value and the increase with increasing
angle could not be explained. Results for the friction coefficient as a
function of impact angle are shown in Fig. 82(b). Eq. (130) together
with Eq. (125) are used to calculate fmin. At an impact angle of
B; the measured value is far below fmin, indicating that sliding
’i 1⁄4 33
occurs during the exit (rebound). A value of fglass/glass (cid:5) 0.17 is used
for angles ’i < 45° [268]. A significant difference in studies using a
powdery layer is that rebound velocities are typically lower, rebound
angles show a broad scattering and particles from the substrate can
be ejected. The lowered rebound velocity is mainly caused by the
particulate layer absorbing kinetic energy of incoming particles. Par-
ticles inside the bed rearrange and typically a larger mass for the tar-
get particle is used for prediction as suggested by Werner [522] in
the following form:
mp;2 1⁄4 Cm ¢ mp;1;

ð133Þ

where Cm is a proportionality factor. The effective mass of the target
particle is always larger than the mass of the target particle itself,
considering the momentum transfer into the bed of particles around
and beneath the target particle [268]. Van Beek et al. [268] found
that the proportionality factor Cm is dependent on the bed porosity,
the stickiness of bed particles, the layer thickness and the binding
between target particles, and can be viewed as a system parameter.
Is the binding perfect (e.g. for a molten layer or a solid, rough sur-
face), the mass mp,2 and Cm approach infinity. For a glass particle bed
it was found to be in the range of Cm 1⁄4 2:6 (cid:1) 3:5 depending on the
diameter ratio of incident to target particles. A smaller value of Cm is
observed when the diameter of the incoming particle increases com-
pared to the target particle diameter.

Fig. 82. Results from glass particle impaction on flat solid glass surface (taken from van Beek et al. [268]): (a) normal coefficient of restitution as a function of impact angle ’i, and
(b) friction coefficient f as a function of impact angle ’i for a glass/glass material combination.

Fig. 83(a) shows a recorded image illustrating the impaction of a
particle and the ejection of bed particles from a powdery surface.
These images are used for the determination of rebound angles and
velocity ratios. The measurements on the absolute rebound angle
as a function of normal velocity ratio are shown in Fig. 83(b). The
maximum rebound velocity ratio and thus the normal restitution
coefficient is around en 1⁄4 0:58. Most values are in the region
0.1 (cid:2) en (cid:2) 0.3, indicating a high damping of a powdery glass layer.
The absolute rebound angle shows a broad scattering with most par-
ticles rebounding at an angle of ’r (cid:5) 40°. A rebound in the negative
tangential direction (left side) was nearly as common as a rebound
to the positive tangential direction (right side). Therefore, when a
particle impacts a rough surface a random distribution around
cr (cid:5) 50° to cr (cid:5) (cid:1)50
is observed. Van Beek et al. [268] used the
two-body collision model described by Eqs. (127)(cid:1)(130) together
with Eq. (133) with Cm 1⁄4 3:5 in order to predict rebound angles. Rel-
atively good agreement with experiments is reported for the
rebound angle and its distribution as well as the rebound velocity
ratio. Thus, this kind of model can be applied.

B

It can be summarized that the normal coefficient of restitution
and the friction coefficient are highly dependent on material proper-
ties of both collision partners - Young’s modulus, yield stress - and
process parameters - impaction velocity, impaction angle, particle
sizes and surface roughness [268]. The tangential coefficient of resti-
tution seems to be dependent on the friction coefficient of the mate-
rial combination and can be approximated using the following

equation:
(cid:13)

f 1⁄4 min fmat:1=mat:2; 2=7 cot ’ið
1 þ en

(cid:16)
Þ
;

ð134Þ

where fmat.1/mat.2 is the friction coefficient of material 1 and 2. Using
this equation and data from van Beek et al. [268], Fig. 84 can be cal-
culated. It shows the tangential coefficient of restitution as a func-
tion of impact angle, analogously to Fig. 79(b). Predictions are
compared to measurements of M€uller et al. [523], who investigated
the impaction of Al2O3 particles on steel at various impact angles.
Relatively good agreement can be seen and a similar curve as pre-
dicted by Wu et al. [515], shown in Fig. 79(b), is obtained. However,
a high sensitivity towards the friction coefficient f at high angles of
impaction (’i > 60°) is observed.

Abd-Elhady et al. [524] used the same equipment as van Beek
et al. [268] and studied the interaction and ejection of particles from
a bed upon incoming particles. The two-body collision model was
replaced by the so-called discrete element method (DEM), in which
every particle contact including rearrangements in the bed,
is
described. Konstandopoulos [434] reports that the two-body colli-
sion model (with a higher effective mass for the target particle
according to Eq. (133)) fails at higher kinetic energies of impacting
particles, when they induce rearrangements or erosion of pre-depos-
ited particles [434,524]. The DEM, developed by Cundall and Strack
[525], treats every particle as a discrete entity, which interacts at its
interface when in contact with other particles [524]. This method is

given. In addition, equations for the ejection time and the maxi-
mum deformation also referred to as the interpenetration distance
of two equal sized particles as a function of material properties are
presented and discussed. The maximum indentation of an incident
particle hitting a bed of particles is shown to be directly propor-
tional to the incident particle velocity and diameter if plastic defor-
mation occurs [524].

An early study using DEM simulations in order to predict
deposit growth for uniform particles was presented by Konstando-
poulos [434]. Simulations were carried out in a three-dimensional
domain using the FORTRAN code “FROZEN”. The calculation is per-
formed until a total number of 105 particles are deposited on
63x63 particle radii substrate with periodic boundaries [434]. The
following parameters were chosen for the simulation: e 1⁄4 0:9; f 1⁄4
0:2; Ev 1⁄4 0; 0:01; 0:1; and n 1⁄4 0:33 [434,527], where Ev is a dimen-
sionless number relating kinetic energy to rotational energy. It
relates the rotational energy barrier to the normal adhesion barrier
[434]. Simulations are carried out using dimensionless parameters,
where the velocity is normalized using the kinetic energy and parti-
cle mass. Model results are shown as two-dimensional cross-sec-
tions in Fig. 86 for different dimensionless impact velocities and
Xfeatures compared
impact angles. The author reports many commonD
with real particulate deposit pictures in literature. At low impact
velocities, a “roughening” is observed which increases with decreas-
ing impact angle. Orientated voids are caused by regions, where par-
ticle deposition is prevented and rebound will occur. These voids
decrease with increasing particle velocity. At high impact velocities,
the effect of impact angle diminishes and denser deposits are
obtained. This is also reported by other studies such as the work of
Ots [528]. Another finding shows that with increasing deposition
velocity the number of rebounding particles increases. This is sup-
ported by experiments of Tsai and Cheng [529] using high loadings
and an uncoated flat impaction surface. Furthermore, the number of
impactions that a particle requires until it rests/sticks increases with
increasing impact velocity. The results show that rebound velocity
shows a multimodal nature and particles take up spin after collision.
DEM simulations can be a useful, but computationally expensive,
tool for the prediction of deposit structure, in particular at low tem-
peratures such as the economizer region. At higher temperatures,
sintering and melting occur leading to changes in structures and
deposit growth. With this method, effects such as shedding and ero-
sion can be predicted.

5.4. Impact and rebound on a liquid layer

Studies of particles impacting a solid substrate overlaid with a
liquid layer are rare. These collision can be relevant for a variety of
industries such as filtration or ash particle impaction on a slagged
wall. Barnocky and Davis [530] conducted a series of experiments in
which a solid ball drops on a quartz disk overlaid with a thin layer of
Newtonian oil. Ball size and thus kinetic energy was varied from 1.6
to 6.4 mm, and material was either steel or polymer (lucite). Studied
parameters comprise of the fluid layer thickness and viscosity, the
ball size, density and elasticity. In their experiments, Barnocky and
Davis [530] determined the critical drop height, and thus the critical
velocity, that allowed the ball to rebound out of the fluid layer. The
critical velocity, below which particles will stick, can be approxi-
mated by neglecting the air resistance vp;crit 1⁄4
. According
to the authors, this equation is valid within 5% accuracy for their
experiments [530]. Results of their study can be seen in Figs. 87(a)
and (b). In general, an increased critical drop height (height of falling,
above which rebound begins) is observed with increasing fluid layer
thickness. The particle is able to penetrate the fluid layer deeper and
thus dissipation of the initial kinetic energy is increased. In the case
of rebound, particles must deform elastically and thus be in close
contact with the underlying solid surface. Fig. 87(a) shows the effect

often extended for plastic deformation upon contact using e.g. the
model of Thornton and Ning [290] or the one proposed by Rogers
and Reed [418]. An overview on the DEM and its capabilities can be
found in the review of Li et al. [526]. Abd-Elhady et al. [524] con-
ducted 490 experiments using spherical copper particles with a
diameter of 54 mm and different impact speeds. The particles impact
vertically on a bed which is composed of the same particles and had
a porosity of 0.42. Experiments were conducted at room tempera-
tures and the number of ejected particles were recorded. A regime
map is derived from the experiment showing different zones - stick-
ing, rebound and rebound with ejection of bed particles. The regime
map is shown in Fig. 85. The particles will stick below a critical
velocity of vp,crit (cid:5) 0.3 m/s. Rebound, is observed in the region of
0.18 (cid:2) vp,n<1.1 m/s. At higher values of 0.6 (cid:2) vp,n<1.8 m/s, the ejec-
is
tion of an additional particle, besides the incident particle,
observed. Two and more additional particles are ejected at
vp,n (cid:3) 1.5 m/s. The overlap was explained by the impact angle. The
incident particle can hit a bed particle at various microscopic
angles, similar to Fig. 80. The DEM conducted by Abd-Elhady et al.
[524] was able to predict the critical velocity and rebound velocity
with a slight deviation. Furthermore, equations for energy loss due
to plastic deformation, adhesion and stored elastic energy are

of fluid viscosity on the rebound behavior of 3.2 mm steel balls. With
increasing fluid viscosity, the drop height increases since a fluid with
higher viscosity is able to dissipate more of the particle’s kinetic
energy. This energy misses for particle deformation and rebound.
Fig. 87(b) illustrates the effect of surface roughness on the rebound
behavior. Here, 75 mm glass beads (particles) were fixed to the land-
ing surface using epoxy resin. The density was 17 beads/mm2 [530].
The beads were half imbedded in the epoxy yielding a surface with
38 mm hemispherical bumps with a mean center to center distance
of 150 mm. These bumps with a radius of xb 1⁄4 38 mm are overlaid
with a film of viscous fluid. When comparing experimental results
with a smooth surface, approximately one order of magnitude
thicker fluid film is needed for the same critical height leading to
particle rebound. Thus, the liquid film can be considerably thicker
and the particle will still stick. A ball of the size 1.6 mm dropped
from 0.6 m, rebounds at a film of approximately 60 mm for a smooth
substrate compared to around 220 mm, for a rough surface. Barnocky
and Davis [530] explain this drastic increase using a theory pre-
sented by Davis et al. [531], which is based on Hertz contact
theory of solid elasticity together with viscous lubrication theory.

6. Comparison of different sticking criteria

for

Sticking criteria presented in Section 4 comprise of relatively
simple models with just one parameter, up to complex models
that require a number of temperature-dependent material prop-
erties
their mathematical description. These properties
should ideally be known for all possible ash particle composi-
tions. In addition, the majority of models does not account for a
sticky surface or rebound behavior. Therefore, the goal of this
section is a comparison and validation of different sticking crite-
ria, the development of a mechanistic model considering all
important parameters including the description of
rebound
behavior.

6.1. Experimental setup and results

In order to eliminate the influence of particle to particle variation
in chemistry and size, soda-lime glass particles within a narrow size
range are used. These particles have been applied in previous studies
[1,201,222] and exhibit similar properties as ash particles. Glass par-
ticle deposition tests are conducted using an entrained flow reactor
(EFR) for three size-graded particle classes (40(cid:1)70, 150(cid:1)210 and
500 mm) and three wall temperatures (800, 900 and 1000 °C). A
detailed description of
the test rig can be found elsewhere
[185,188]. Tests are conducted for a short period, texp (cid:5) 10 min, in
order to eliminate sintering and erosion effects and reduce the influ-
ence of the deposit on capture efficiency. Experimental conditions
and results are given in Table 23. Deposited mass is determined by
weight difference. A previously described optical system is D

; given in Table 23, show that at 800 °C only the small-
est particle size leads to deposit formation. A minor amount is found
for the intermediate particle size and no deposition occurs for large
particles. The main reason for this is the lower temperature of large
particles when impacting on the deposition probe. Residence times
are too short and heating rates too low for larger particles to reach
the wall temperature. At 900 °C, deposit formation is also observed
for the intermediate particle size, 150(cid:1)210 mm, whereas the largest

particles still rebound. Increasing the EFR wall temperature to 1000 °
C revealed similar results with increased deposition rates. The
deposit structure is mostly particulate and only experiment 8
showed a molten layer.

6.2. CFD model and comparison of results

Experimental results are used, and recalculated with a CFD
model. The model predicts the flow field, temperatures as well as
glass particle trajectories. The computational grid has a total num-
ber of 1.56 million nodes. Special attention is paid to an adequate
resolution of the deposition probe, following suggestions estab-
lished in the work of Weber et al. [206]. Two nodes are placed
within the displacement thickness in radial direction in order to
resolve the boundary layer and predict accurate particle tracks as
well as impaction rates. A total number of 96 nodes around the
circumference of the probe revealed independent deposition rates.
The number is lower compared to the recommendation of Weber
et al. [206], who suggested 384 nodes around the circumference.
This could lead to an over prediction of the impaction efficiency at
small Stokes numbers St < 1. However, since glass particles in
the present work are relatively large, with smallest sizes in the
range of 24.3 mm as given in Table 24, deposition rates are not
over predicted and numerical accuracy is given. This grid revealed
identical deposition rates compared to a mesh with four million
nodes. More details on the computational mesh, the model selec-
tion and sensitivity studies can be found elsewhere [185,188]. In
the CFD model, glass particles are injected as inert material, with a
narrow-sized Rosin(cid:1)Rammler distribution, fitted to measure-
ments. Particle temperature is calculated using heat balance [534].
Particles close to the reactor wall almost reached the wall temper-
ature, whereas particles in the center stayed below this value.
Temperature-dependent properties of soda-lime glass are imple-
mented in the CFD code, based on a literature review. Thermo-
physical properties of glass particles are calculated at each position

using the local particle temperature, and thus consider a tempera-
ture change within the boundary layer of the probe. Hence, adhe-
sion properties are calculated using local temperatures and not
bulk values, which is a crucial aspect, in particular for small par-
ticles dp < 10 (cid:1) 20 mm, which cool down in the vicinity of a cold
tube. Properties, PSD and glass composition are summarized in
Appendix B. In addition, properties for the deposition probe, com-
posed of Al2O3, are given. The only required quantity that is not
found in the literature is a temperature-dependent contact angle of
soda-lime glass on a ceramic substrate. In order to obtain values,
the ash melting microscope EM 201 of the company “Hesse Instru-
ments” is used [532]. A soda-lime glass sphere with a diameter of
1.5 mm is placed on a ceramic plate composed of the same material
as the deposition probe. Three different heating rates are tested to
ensure independent results. Fig. 88 shows shadow images recorded
at different temperatures. The contact angle Qc is determined
graphically from these images using the software ImageJ. The results
are fitted with Eq. (54). The coefficients are determined as A 1⁄4 0; B 1⁄4
180; C 1⁄4 930 and D 1⁄4 100. The results are illustrated in the left part
of Fig. 88. Deviations at lower temperatures are due to an insuffi-
cient resolution of the camera. The image at ambient temperature
does not change up to 700 °C. Only values above that temperature
can be determined properly, caused by a shade of the ceramic plate.
The plate shadow makes it difficult to determine small changes in
the contact angle at
low temperatures. Nevertheless, values
above Q 1⁄4 100
can be calculated using Eq. (54). Once all required
properties of soda-lime glass are known, sticking criteria can be
investigated. A total of eight sticking criteria are implemented in
the code and CFD results are compared with measurements. The
sticking criteria are:

Fig. 89(a) shows a graphical comparison of C2 (Zhou et al. [391])
and C5 (Walsh et al. [395]). The model of Zhou et al. [391] uses the
Xin order to calculate the sticking behavior. In the pres-
melt fractionD
ent case, thermodynamic equilibrium calculations using the soft-
ware FactSage are applied to obtain the melt fraction as a function of
temperature. However, it is questionable if it is meaningful to calcu-
late the melt fraction for amorphous material, where there is no
crystal formation. Nevertheless, this criterion is tested for complete-
ness. Further details on FactSage can be found in the publication of
Wieland et al. [312]. The model of Walsh [395] uses a reference vis-
cosity of mref 1⁄4 100 PaD
Xs, based on their experiments. The curve
slope and the horizontal position can be adjusted by changing the
reference viscosity. In addition Fig. 89(a) shows measured ash fusion

tests and simulations. Particle trajectories are calculated in ANSYS
Fluent, exported and evaluated with sticking criteria C1 to C8 using
a Matlab code. If a particle sticks to the reactor wall or the deposition
probe, the calculation ends. If the particle rebounds, it will continue
its track. Deposition rates are calculated for all ten experiments
(Exp. 1 to Exp. 10) and compared with measurements. The root
mean square error (RMSE) and the correlation coefficient are used as
a quality indicator. It is calculated using all experiments and numeri-
cal simulation results. Simulation results and the coefficients are
given in Table 23. The best correlation coefficient and RMSE are
obtained for the model of Srinivasachar et al. [1] (C3) using Eq. (73),
where critical viscosity is dependent on particle kinetic energy and
thus its size, density and velocity. A parity plot comparing experi-
ments and simulations is shown in Fig. 89(b). It can be seen that all
three sticking criteria underpredict deposition rates, with the best
agreement for Srinivasachar et al. [1] (C3). The higher deposition
rates in the experiments are probably due to the stickiness of the
deposit during build-up. The highest deposition rates are calculated
for C4 and C5 as shown in Table 23. Both use a viscosity value at
which sticking begins. They might yield better results by changing
the critical or reference viscosity. However, Scholz [459] tested the
sensitivity towards this threshold and results only improved slightly.
Criteria based on energy or momentum conservation (C6, C7 or C8)
yield acceptable results, when comparing the RMSE and correlation
coefficient in Table 23. Here, the main difficulty is to find appropriate
material properties, such as the Young’s modulus as a function of

temperature and for different ash particle chemistry. Relatively good
results are achieved with criteria based on the melt fraction. A solu-
tion could be the coupling of thermodynamic equilibrium calcula-
tions with CFD. By far the best agreement is achieved by using
criterion C3, which is simple, reliable and only requires one chemis-
try-dependent parameter: particle viscosity.

6.3. Mechanistic modeling approach

In the following part, the mechanistic model of Mao et al. [390]
(criterion C8) is examined in detail in order to explain the depen-
dence of the critical viscosity on the particle kinetic energy (shown
by criterion C3). Part of this explanation was published previously
[532] and is extended here. Mechanistic expressions for ash particle
rebound or sticking behavior are rare in literature. The majority of
studies with mechanistic models can be found in the field of liquid
droplet impaction on a solid substrate. The deformation during
impact is predicted and typically validated using photographs and
images from experiments. However, there is very little work on ash
particles and their rebound behavior. In this section, literature equa-
tions are investigated in terms of their suitability for a mechanistic
ash particle sticking and rebound criterion. Mechanistic models
are typically based on energy conservation, as already mentioned in
Section 4.3. The impaction and deformation process is subdivided
into five consecutive stages as shown in Fig. 90. The energy of a
particle during impact at stage “0” is the sum of the kinetic EKE

Eqs. (143) and (140) assume that the particle is shaped as a thin cir-

late the maximum spread factor, defined by ξ 1⁄4 dp;max=dp; in order
to predict the impaction behavior of a liquid droplet: e.g. sticking,

The definition of the spatial directions x, y and the velocity compo-

in the boundary layer. Eq. (146) has been widely used, however, the
determination of f, V and tc varies. Mao et al. [390] for instance dis-
tinguished between low and high viscosity droplets. High viscosity
droplets are defined for cases in which the theoretical boundary

viscosity droplets such as water or alcohol droplets. Ash particles
on the contrary, can have a significantly higher viscosity values in
Xs. Fig. 90 illustrates the expected impac-
the range of 0.001(cid:1)109 PaD
tion stages for a high viscosity fluid, e.g. a molten ash particle [532].
Estimations based on Eq. (148) yield spread factors for ash particles
in the range of 0 < ξ (cid:2) 2.2. A sticking or rebound criterion can only
be derived if energy losses occurring during stage “3” and “4” are
considered. A particle will stick if all energy from stage “0” is dissi-
pated. If energy is left, the particle will rebound. Therefore, the
energy dissipated during droplet deformation between stage “2”
and “4” EDE
; and the surface energy at stage “4” ESE
4 have to be
expressed. The droplet shape at different stages illustrated in
Fig. 90 is more or less unknown for ash particles and should be
studied in the near future in order to determine the exact deforma-
tion. In general, a droplet will rebound from its substrate if the fol-
lowing equation is satisfied:

The particle shape is needed in order to estimate the surface energy

Eq. (152) calculates the excess rebound energy EERE, a parameter
indicating whether there is energy left for rebound (EERE > 0) or all
energy is dissipated during deformation (EERE (cid:2) 0). Eq. (148) and
(152) can be employed in order to predict glass particle deposition
behavior as illustrated in Fig. 91. However, this requires tempera-
ture-dependent glass particle properties, which are again taken fromD

the Appendix BD
X. In total, ten equations are used to identify the criti-
cal temperature and thus, the critical viscosity, at which glass par-
ticles rebound and Eq. (152) fulfills the condition EERE 1⁄4 0. These ten
equations comprise of temperature-dependent properties that are
viscosity, density, surface tension and contact angle, the Reynolds
and Weber number, Eqs. (152) and (148), including equations for p
and q of the cubic expression given by Eq. (148) [532]. The goal is to
find the critical viscosity as a function of particle kinetic energy.
Therefore, the particle kinetic energy is varied using a different par-
ticle velocities, whereas the particle diameter is kept constant at
dp 1⁄4 50 mm. The same particle size was used in experiments shown
in Fig. 91.

A comparison of the above-mentioned model, and equations
originally proposed by Mao et al. [390] with glass particle meas-
urements is presented in Fig. 91(a). It can be seen that the pres-
ent model fits considerably better than the original equations of
Mao et al. [390]. The difference between both approaches is the
particle shape at stage 4 - given by Eq. (150). Equations of Mao
et al. [390] under predict the critical viscosity by four to five
orders of magnitude. Hence, resulting deposition rates are also
expected to be under predicted. This is confirmed by simulations
in Table 23 for criterion C8. M€uller et al. [202] applied equations
of Mao et al. [390], and found that the model does not work for
particles smaller than dp < 75 mm. Instead, they used the melt
fraction criterion for small particles, where particles containing
(cid:3) 15% molten phase are assumed to be sticky. Large particles
with dp (cid:3) 75 mm rebounded, which was successfully predicted
using the model of Mao et al. [390]. Some uncertainty concern-
ing the grid resolution exists in this study. Weber et al. [206]
found in a later study, that a relatively fine grid is needed for
predicting accurate particle impaction rates. Nevertheless, it is
concluded that this model might be suitable for larger particles
and fails in the case of small ash particles [532].

An explanation, why the model of Mao et al. [390] works for
larger particles, can be seen in Fig. 91(a). The critical viscosity
increases at a particle kinetic energy of Ep;kin 1⁄4 10(cid:1)9 J, which implies
that high inertia particles are sticky even at lower temperatures. It
can be explained by an increased particle deformation, and thus, less
remaining energy for rebound. This behavior is more pronounced for
particles impacting at high velocities or for large particles. However,
experimental evidence is still due, and should be studied in future
work. The presented equations can explain why particles with low

The corresponding threshold temperatures are 606 °C for normal
and 816 °C for non-normal (75°) impact. Thus, a decrease in impac-
tion angle reduces the sticking probability at a given temperature.
The curve shown in Fig. 93(b) can be fitted using a tangent law, as
given by the second term in Eq. (154).

The equations described above require temperature-dependent
properties and involve complex expressions. Therefore, a simpler
model is desired. Furthermore, they are obtained for a clean and
solid substrate. However, clean heat exchanger surfaces can only be
found during the commissioning of a power station. Therefore, there
is a need to consider an existing deposit layer and its stickiness. Typ-
ically, deposits are classified into three categories: particulate, sin-
tered or molten [266]. The impaction of solidified fly ash particles on
a particulate deposit is highly complex, as shown and discussed in
Section 5.3. These solid and maybe sharp particles can lead to ero-
sion, shedding, or they can be captured in the porous structure. In
case of a molten deposit layer, e.g. on a wall of a slagging gasifier,
the problem simplifies [532]. If either the particle or the surface is
sticky, the particle will adhere:

It is unclear if this equation is valid in case of particulate or sin-
tered deposit. When sticking criteria are used, it is recommended
to estimate the wall temperature and in case of a deposit layer
its viscosity and the porosity. For CFD modeling, this can be
done on a cell by cell basis as well as for wall faces. For highly
porous layers, e.g. p > 0.7, an impacting particle can lead to shed-
ding or more likely it is captured inside the structure, similar to
a fabric filter. In all other cases, Eq. (153) can be used. Critical
viscosity is then calculated using particle kinetic energy and
an empirical equation fitted to measurements as shown in
Fig. 91(a). It is recommended to only use the absolute particle
velocity as suggested by Weber et al. [206]. The angle of impac-
tion is introduced in a second term, using a tangent law, accord-
ing to the following expression:

glass particles tests of Srinivasachar et al. [1]. The developed model
is therefore recommended for CFD implementation and detailed
investigations. A parameter variation on the spread factor ξ and con-
tact angle Qc is shown in Fig. 91(b). At low values of ξ, particles do
not deform and rebound. At around ξ (cid:5) 0.5 particles enter the stick-
ing regime. The contact angle is only of relevance at higher deforma-
tions. Within the region of power plants 0 < ξ (cid:2) 2.2, the contact
angle plays a minor role. Furthermore, a considerably lower sticking
probability is again observed when using the equations of Mao et al.
[390].

A crucial parameter is the angle of impaction ’ since it influences
the amount of kinetic energy, which can be dissipated during defor-

6.4. Model sensitivity

A parameter study is conducted in order to evaluate model
sensitivity towards process conditions and particle properties.
Studied process conditions include particle diameter, velocity
and temperature; thermo-physical properties are particle viscos-
ity, surface tension, density and contact angle with the substrate.
The latter are studied individually, even though they all change
with a temperature increase. Fig. 96(a) and (b)D
X show the effect
of particle diameter and particle impact velocity on the excess
rebound energy. Parameters used for the sensitivity study are
summarized in Table 25. The base case uses soda-lime glass par-
ticles at 800 °C. As long as the particle velocity is below vp 1⁄4 1
m/s, particle remain in the sticking regime. For instance, a 100 mm
particle will rebound in between vp 1⁄4 1...30 m/s. At higher values,
plastic deformation cannot dissipate all kinetic energy, and par-
ticles will rebound. A much lower sensitivity is observed for the
impaction angle ’. But still, decreasing the impact angle from ’ 1⁄4

. There is a non-linear
behavior at small impaction angles. The highest sensitivity for par-
ticle properties is found for the particle viscosity. If the particle vis-
cosity is below mp 1⁄4 104 Pa ¢ s, all particles will stick, no matter
which size. But a change to mp 1⁄4 105 Pa ¢ s leads to rebound for all
particles larger than dp 1⁄4 2 mm. This behavior underlines the exis-
tence for a critical value. Since viscosity is coupled exponentially to
the particle temperature, an even higher sensitivity is found for
particle temperature. The sensitivity towards particle properties,
as shown in Fig. 97(a) and (b), follows the order from high to low:
viscosity > surface tension > density > contact angle.

The sticking criterion given by Eqs. (153) and (154) can be imple-
mented in CFD codes using subroutines with several sub-models for
particle viscosity and density, which are all calculated composition-
and temperature-dependent. A possible improvement can be
achieved by incorporating van der Waals forces for small particles.
However, additional parameters, in particular the distance between
two surfaces in contact, are needed and unfortunately unknown.
Often, it is discussed, whether surface tension effects and contact
angle are important. Bennett and Poulikakos [533] compared differ-
ent correlations predicting the spreading of droplets during impac-
tion. They derived regimes in which viscous dissipation, or surface
tension and wetting effects dominate. Their analysis showed that if

tems, particles impact on a rough surface and deformation occurs.

is full-filled, surface tension and wetting become important.
Above this criterion, spreading is dominated by the droplet viscos-
ity and their ability to deform, as shown in Fig. 95. In this region,
wetting and contact angle only marginally affect the deposition
process. Fig. 95 shows a regime map including glass particle stud-
ies, a large Fe-rich particle at 1200 °C, and a typical Al(cid:1)Si particle
at 1100 °C. It can be seen that all particles are in the viscous dissi-
pation domain, underlining the importance of viscosity. Deposi-
tion might be affected by surface tension and contact angle
effects, however, controlling is the particle viscosity and the abil-
ity to deform due to low viscosity values. A further interesting
topic is solidification of ash particles during the contact with the
surface. Theoretical considerations and experiments of Aziz and
Chandra [451] show that solidification does not change impaction
as long as Ste=
< 1. For the investigated glass particle
experiments the term yields low values of 0.04. Nevertheless, it is
assumed that solidification and thermal stresses induced by differ-
ent thermal expansion of the steel tube and ash particles lead to
rebound of a molten ash particle upon the contact. Shrinking dur-
ing solidification might lead to detachment. Further research
should also be directed towards this issue. The formation of a solid
skin around a molten particle might also be of importance. The sur-
face starts to cool inside the boundary layer through convection

however, unknown.

7. Recommendations for modeling ash formation and deposition

Modeling ash formation, deposition and predicting the deposit
chemistry, require simple and reliable models in particular when
coupled with CFD in order to predict slagging and fouling propen-
sities. There are excellent individual/standalone models available
for predicting ash formation, rebound behavior or fuel conversion,
however, if all models are combined and one model is inaccurate,
others might suffer and the overall accuracy is not satisfying. The
particle transport and the sticking criterion play a crucial role since
they lead to selective deposition, where the sticking propensity
mainly depends on the particle chemistry, size, velocity and tem-
perature. Future studies predicting slagging and fouling should
avoid using bulk ash chemistry. Instead detailed information on
individual particle chemistry, e.g. provided by CCSEM, should be
used instead. Otherwise, the prediction of the deposit chemistry,
which is known to differ from the bulk ash, is not possible. Often,
it is shown that ash deposits are enriched in iron [186] and/or
alkali metals [535], depending on the fuel and location inside the
boiler. Studies on co-combustion of wood and coal have shown
that the deposit chemistry on the cylinder front face is similar to
the fly ash fraction at around 2.5 mm, and the leeside deposit is
similar to the sub-micron fraction at around 150 nm [66]. Hence,

tension, (c) particle density and (d) contact angle with the substrate at a particle velocity of 5 m/s. If one parameter is varied, others are fixed to values at 800 °C.

models using bulk ash cannot predict ash deposit chemistry prop-
erly. A modeling approach should include solid fuel combustion,
ash formation including the release of inorganics and aerosol for-
mation, ash particle transport, ash deposition and deposit build-
up. In order to describe the first three steps a number of fuel prop-
erties have to be measured or determined in advance. Fig. 97
shows the most important properties. They can be divided into
fuel composition and fuel reaction kinetics. Fuel composition uses
standard fuel characterization methods (ultimate, proximate and
heating value analysis), particle size distribution, mineral analysis
using CCSEM, as well as chemical fractionation. The first two are
essential. CCSEM analysis are needed for individual particle inor-
ganic chemistry, enabling the prediction of ash formation and
deposit chemistry. X-ray powder diffraction analysis might also be
a good alternative, in particular for biomass. For coal, the mac-
eral-mineral association is important in order to model the dis-

Reaction parameters include the kinetic parameters for devolatili-
zation, and char combustion. The determination of these parameters
requires high experimental efforts, and, carefully conducted experi-
ments. Often, kinetic data is taken from literature using similar fuels.
However, this can lead to high uncertainties. If fuel conversion and
flame properties are of interest, the kinetic parameters have to be

measured. With all fuel properties and kinetics being available, simu-
lations on ash formation and deposition can be conducted. The ash
formation model should be able to predict the vaporization of inor-
ganic elements and the re-condensation of these inorganic vapors.
Furthermore, coalescence, char and mineral fragmentation as well as
shedding should be included - a challenging and difficult task. Here,
a promising approach are percolation models such as the work of
Kang et al. [477,478]. Devolatilization and char combustion are
known to influence ash formation. Once ash formation can be pre-
dicted accurately in terms of chemistry and size distribution, ash
deposition mechanisms are required. The most important ones are
inertial impaction, thermophoresis and diffusion of aerosols. Eddy
impaction can only be predicted when using unsteady simulations,
ideally resolving small turbulent scales in space and time.

The ash particle sticking and rebound behavior can be described
by a large number of models with varying level of detail. The follow-
ing suggestions are based on the review in this work. Four different
scenarios are discussed and recommendations are given:

Salt-rich ashes: typical for straw and herbaceous biomass

(cid:3) Recommendation: Melt fraction as proposed by Isaak et al.
[388,389] using Eq. (70). The melt fraction should be calculated
as a function of temperature, ash particle chemistry, and gas
composition surrounding the particle. Again, bulk ash should be
avoided and particle to particle variation in chemistry should be
considered. For the calculation of the melt fraction, commer-
cially available tools can be used.

The sticking behavior of wood ash is mostly unknown. Experi-
mental data and detailed studies dealing with coarse wood ash
particles are missing. This ash is rich in Ca and Mg with a rela-
tively high melting point. Viscosity models fail in the case of Ca-
rich ashes. Thermodynamic equilibrium calculations might be
able to predict the melt fraction, however further studies and val-
idations are needed in this field. A similar situation is found for
ashes rich in P (found in manures) or S (for instance in lignites).
In general, an energy conservation approach calculating a critical
parameter is recommend. The viscosity might be a good parame-
ter since it changes considerably with composition and tempera-
ture, and it is known to strongly affect the stickiness. The key is
to find a correlation predicting the energy dissipated during parti-
cle deformation.

An exemplary calculation for silicate-rich ash particles is given in
Fig. 99. Particle sticking or rebound behavior is predicted for differ-
ent impact angles, an impact velocity of 2.5 m/s and a particle size of
20 mm at 800 and 1200 °C, respectively. It can be seen that a 800 °C
particle only sticks at normal impact, whereas at 1200 °C particles

to a decrease in the rebound angle. The rebound velocity on the con-

improvement is needed, e.g. as suggested by Eq. (156). However, the
calculation of energy loss during collision is complex. There are
many different equations for the calculation of the spread factor ξ
and the energy dissipation of liquid droplets. Bennett and Poulikakos
[533] compared different equations and give an overview on the cal-
culation of the spread factor. In this area, more fundamental and
experimental work is needed aiming at molten or partially molten
ash particles.

8. Concluding remarks

The present work aims for a deeper understanding of ash depo-
sition in particular the ash particle sticking and rebound behavior.
The whole process of ash formation and ash deposition is discussed
critically, and main findings and mechanisms are presented for a
broad spectrum of solid fuels including coals, woody and herba-
ceous biomass.

Ash formation is a highly complex process, which can only be
predicted when distribution, form and association of inorganic spe-
cies in the fuel is known. Inorganics can be found as organically-
bound inorganic elements, as dissolved salts, as mineral inclusions
in the fuel matrix or as excluded mineral grains separated from the
fuel. The chemical composition of individual mineral grains in a fuel
sample differs significantly. This variation requires the use of sophis-
ticated methods such as SEM/EDX or CCSEM characterizing the indi-
vidual particle composition and revealing information on the

amount and chemistry of inorganic species. A substantial number of
particles has to be detected in order to obtain independent and sta-
tistically meaningful results. It is crucial to use SEM/EDX data
instead of bulk ash chemistry when predicting ash formation
and ash deposition. Otherwise, wrong conclusions concerning
slagging and fouling behavior can be drawn. Often, single particle
types with relatively low quantity in the fuel (individual miner-
als/inclusions or clusters of mineral grains) are causing ash
related problems, whereas the majority of fly ash particles is
unproblematic and harmless. For instance, when firing bitumi-
nous coal, pyrite in reducing conditions can be such a compo-
nent leading to excessive slagging of heat exchangers. Another
example are small, salt-rich particles in straw combustion sys-
tems. Therefore, bulk ash composition can be misleading and
models should not be based on bulk ash analyses. Ash formation
mechanisms are well understood for coal, however in the case of
biomass further research is needed. The exact role of fusion,
fragmentation and shedding during ash formation is more or less
unknown. Relatively well understood is the vaporization and re-
condensation of inorganic elements for straw and wood combus-
tion. A substantial quantity of the fuel, mainly elements such as
Cl, P, Pb, S, Zn and to some extent Ca, K, Mg, Na, vaporizes, re-
condenses and forms aerosols during cooling.

Ash deposition mechanisms are inertial impaction including
eddy impaction, thermophoresis, diffusion of aerosols, condensa-
tion and reactions between deposit and inorganic vapors.

156

U. Kleinhans et al. / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 68 (2018) 65(cid:1)168

Temperature-driven effects, such as condensation, chemical reac-
tions and thermophoresis dominate during early stages and
mainly depend on the quantity of particles and inorganic vapors
in the vicinity of the heat exchanging surfaces. Thermophoresis
is shown to be a function of the particle and gas thermal conduc-
tivity and models found in literature differ significantly from
each other.

Ash particles can be classified based on chemistry, size and shape.
The first two classifications are often found in literature, however
shape is rarely discussed or reviewed. Frequently observed particle
shapes are:

(cid:3) molten, perfectly spherical particles,
(cid:3) cenospherical particles with variable wall thickness (hollow

spheres),

(cid:3) plerospherical particles (hollow spheres filled with small ash

particles),

(cid:3) angular, sharp and unmolten particles,
(cid:3) loose, irregular shaped and highly porous solids, and
(cid:3) agglomerations of small particles.

Ash particle shape and morphology is often studied when
exploring utilization options. For modeling purposes it is often
assumed that ash particles are perfectly spherical. Particle trajecto-
ries and the sticking and rebound behavior are typically calculated
for spheres and shape variants are ignored. This might be valid for
coal ash, at least to some extent. However, biomass ash particles
are found to differ significantly from spherical particles. In case of
wood, loosely bound and irregularly shaped Ca-rich particles are
frequently reported together with sub-micron salt particles. Straw
particles are often spherical with sub-micron particles attached to
their surfaces.

Ash particle properties and their mathematical description are
essential when modeling ash particle sticking and rebound behavior.
Properties are temperature- and composition-dependent and thus
often difficult to predict. The following list summarizes findings
from an extensive literature review:

(cid:3) Elastic properties such as Young’s modulus and the Poisson
number are more or less unknown for ash particles. Some rare
numbers can be found, however temperature-dependence and
correlations considering composition are non existent.

(cid:3) The melt or solid fraction in an ash system can be calculated as a
function of particle temperature, particle and surrounding gas
composition using thermodynamic equilibrium calculations.
Often, good accuracy is reported when comparing results with
ash fusion tests or measured melting behavior from differential
scanning calorimetry analysis. Nevertheless, the method has
uncertainties in particular for exotic ash compositions. In addi-
tion, calculations assume infinite time, whereas in combustion
systems, time scales can be very short.

(cid:3) The particle viscosity is known as an important parameter for
the particle sticking probability [395]. The viscosity spreads
over a wide range from 10(cid:1)3 to 109 PaD
Xs. The particle viscosity
can be calculated using empirical correlations. A huge number
of models has been developed. However, the accuracy is often
not very good. Vargas et al. [323] reviewed viscosity measure-
ments and model predictions and recommended the model of
Bottinga and Weill [320] for silicate-rich ashes in the high-tem-
perature regime, when the ash is perfectly molten and acts as a
Newtonian fluid. A comparison in this work also revealed rela-
tively good results for the model of Browning et al. [314]. When
an ash particles cools down, crystals can form in the melt lead-
ing to a sharp increase in viscosity. There is only one model
available incorporating this effect - the model of Senior and Sri-
is interesting and should be
nivasachar [316]. This model

improved by correlating it to more measurements and a wider
field of chemical compositions. Relatively good results are
obtained when using a model accounting for the formation of
crystals in the melt. The model of Roscoe [337], which goes back
to Einstein [334] yields good results compared with measure-
ments. The biggest concern with viscosity models is their lim-
ited range of applicability. Models easily under- or over-predict
the actual viscosity by up to three orders of magnitude if used
outside their validated range of composition or temperature.
Models suitable for wood or herbaceous biomass are currently
not available.

(cid:3) Rheology of ash particles is an interesting field. But there are
only few experimental studies indicating thixotropic flow
behavior. Further work in this area is needed. The sintering and
fusion behavior can be described using a modified equation of
Mackenzie and Shuttleworth [354]. The particle density can be
calculated using the method of partial molar densities as sug-
gested for slags [345,353].

(cid:3) The surface tension and contact angle of molten ash droplets can
be estimated using a simple composition- and temperature-
dependent approach. The surface tension varies within a narrow
window (0.03 - 0.6 N/m) compared to the particle viscosity. The
contact angle and thus the wetting behavior of ash particles
with a solid surface is difficult to determine. Moza and Austin
[349] developed a test procedure for measuring the contact
angle with a supercooled substrate. Typical values are in the
range of 50(cid:1)150° strongly dependent on ash particle chemistry
and the surface properties such as roughness, morphology and
temperature.

(cid:3) The thermal conductivity of ash particles and deposit strongly
influences the surface temperature of a forming layer. The ther-
mal conductivity of ash particles and/or deposits is dependent
on the porosity, the temperature, the particle size, the chemical
composition and radiative properties. Radiation is known to
enhance thermal conductivity in porous media at high tempera-
tures. The most important parameter is the porosity of the
deposit or of particle agglomerates. Good agreement between
predictions for the thermal conductivity of a porous layer with
experimental data is observed when using the model of Brails-
ford and Major [381].

The ash particle sticking behavior is influenced by a number of
parameters. The most important ones are: the particle properties
(such as melt fraction, viscosity, surface tension/energy), the parti-
cle kinetic energy and the particle deformation upon impaction, the
particle shape and surface roughness, the angle of impaction, the
substrate roughness and geometry, the substrate properties, such
as surface tension/energy, and forces between particles and the sur-
face (e.g. adhesion or van der Waals forces). Different ash particle
sticking criteria are used and described in literature. They are
mostly empirical and based on simplified cases. The criteria can be
categorized to the following groups and are based on the ash
particle:

(cid:3) melt fraction,
(cid:3) viscosity, or
(cid:3) energy conservation during impact.

The particle melt fraction is a popular approach for biomass in
particular salt-rich particles. It has often been applied to predict
the deposition and sticking tendency when firing biomass
[202,258,391]. This approach can incorporate the effect of reducing
conditions on the melting behavior of ash particles. Furthermore,
modern tools can predict meaningful results for the melt fraction
over a wide range of chemical compositions. Problems arise when
describing the sticking tendency of solidified particles such as sub-

micron particles, which experience rapid cooling in the boundary
layer or ash particles in the economizer region. Here, other
approaches are required. A further missing effect is the angle of
impact. It has been shown that particles impacting under a small
angle of impact are very likely to rebound. Thus, a massive molten
particle, which slightly touches a superheater tube at 90°, will not
stick - it will rebound.

Another quite popular approach is to use the viscosity of an ash
particle at contact with a surface. This approach, however, is often
applied inaccurately. There are two concepts: the reference viscosity
suggested by Walsh et al. [395] and the critical viscosity first pro-
posed as a criterion by Srinivasachar et al. [1,407]. The reference vis-
cosity is the value at which particles start to stick partially. The
critical viscosity on the other hand is the value at which the whole
particle will stick. The model of Walsh et al. [395] is often used as a
theoretical case for bulk ash. An intermediate sticking probability,
where only a small portion of the particle will stick might occur for
liquids, however for high surface tension ash particles, it is unlikely.
Frequently, the reference and critical viscosity are mixed up and
bulk ash composition is used. Bulk ash composition will give an inac-
curate and misleading deposition rate. Furthermore, the deposit
composition will equal the bulk ash composition, which is known to
be incorrect. Srinivasachar et al.
[1] presented an interesting
approach, where the critical viscosity for glass particles was mea-
sured to be a function of the particle kinetic energy. With this
approach, small particles will still adhere even at lower tempera-
tures. The problem with this approach is that a viscosity model is
required. Models have been developed for silicate-rich ashes found
in coal and to some extent in straw; however, not for wood ash or
waste-based fuel ashes. Furthermore, these models do not consider
the angle of impaction.

Energy conservation methods have been applied in two research
fields: the impaction of liquid droplets and of solid, elastic spheres.
In general, these methods use energy balances in order to calculate
whether a particle sticks - kinetic energy of the incoming particle is
completely dissipated - or a particle rebounds - particle kinetic
energy is not completely dissipated. In the case of liquid droplets,
the crucial parameters are the work of deformation (against the par-
ticle viscosity) and the adhesion to the substrate (surface tension,
the wetted area and contact angle). Here, the theory of Mao et al.
[390] proved to be a good approach. In the case of solid particles, a
critical velocity is typically measured or predicted. Here it is com-
monly distinguished between elastic and elastic-plastic impaction
processes. In the latter case, the particle is deformed permanently. A
frequently used and accurate model is presented by Thornton and
Ning [290], which requires Young’s modulus and Poisson number of
both collision partners.

A review on modeling studies reveals that most studies use the
model of Walsh et al. [395] in combination with the bulk ash compo-
sition. Here, the latter is seen as problematic. In order to evaluate the
accuracy, eight different sticking criteria based on all three methods
and variants of these models are implemented in a CFD code and
compared with measurements conducted in an entrained flow reac-
tor. The mass deposited on probes is measured using three narrow
size grades of soda-lime glass particles at three different temperatures
mimicking coal ash particles. The best performance is found for the
model of Srinivasachar et al. [1], where the critical viscosity, below
which particle will stick, depends on the particle kinetic energy. A
mechanistic explanation based on energy conservation and the work
of Mao et al. [390] is extended in order to explain the dependence of
the critical viscosity on the particle kinetic energy. Furthermore, the
model now considers the impact angle and the stickiness of the sub-
strate similar as it is proposed by Walsh et al. [395].

The particle rebound behavior is summarized for different
scenarios: normal impact on a smooth surface including elastic
and elastic-plastic deformation, oblique impact on a smooth

surface, impact on a powdery layer, and impact on a liquid layer
with an underlying solid substrate. Selected models from litera-
ture are discussed and equations are presented. These models are
based on impact mechanics and require knowledge of material
strength properties. Several experimental studies suggest that
there is a distribution of rebound angles caused by the micro-
scopic rough surface area. For small impact angles, rolling and
sliding effects can become important depending on the friction
coefficient. Interesting are the results of small spheres impacting
a powdery layer. At high particle kinetic energy there is an
increased chance, that particles are ejected from the bed depend-
ing on the connectivity between resting particles. A promising
approach is the discrete element method for predicting the
deposit formation at low temperatures, e.g. economizer region
with solidified particles.

In the end, a holistic modeling approach including solid fuel com-
bustion, ash formation and deposition is presented and recommen-
dations for predicting particle sticking and rebound behavior are
given. Currently, different approaches are recommended depending
on the physical state of the particles, i.e. molten or solid, and,
depending on the fuel ash chemistry. Research needs are identified
and summarized in the following two sections.

8.1. Future experimental questions

Future experimental work should be directed towards a number
of issues and research fields. The morphology, association and distri-
bution of inorganic species within biomass fuels should be studied
using advanced methods, such as SEM/EDX. Individual particle com-
position is essential for a relying ash formation model. This data
should then be used as a model input. Sophisticated ash formation
models, such as the percolation models developed for coal, should
be applied for biomass and/or waste-based fuels. Mechanisms form-
ing coarse fly ash particles are still not understood. Since biofuels
are rich in volatile species, ash formation should be studied during
devolatilization, and results should be compared to final ash compo-
sition. This helps in order to understand the interaction of Ca, Si and
K species and the formation of coarse fly ash. Another crucial field of
research are material properties. Viscosity measurements for typical
biomass ashes, rich in Ca and/or salts are needed. Currently, viscosity
measurements focus strongly on aluminosilicates. Material proper-
ties including Young’s modulus, yield strength and Poisson number
are more or less unknown for ash particles. These properties should
be quantified for different chemical compositions and as a function
of temperature focusing on higher temperatures in the range of
300(cid:1)1000 °C. In order to find a generally valid sticking criteria, fun-
damental particle impaction studies are required. High speed cam-
eras should record the impaction process. These fundamental
studies should be carried out for other materials such as salt par-
ticles (pure salts or mixtures of two or more salts), Ca-rich or Fe-rich
particles. It is crucial to use uniform particle size and chemistry. The
particle sticking threshold should be determined for each size and
chemical composition, and be related to particle properties such as
viscosity, melt fraction and the particle kinetic energy. Furthermore,
the role of cenospheres and non-spherical particles should be stud-
ied. A difficult field is the particle sticking behavior of sub-micron
particles. Experimental studies are rare and should be carried out. In
addition, studies on particles impacting on a powdery layer have to
be extended. They are valuable since clean tubes never appear in a
power plant. Another controversy parameter is the impact angle.
Models and experimental results often disagree here and more fun-
damental work on the role of impact angle on the sticking tendency
is needed, in particular at high temperatures. Most of the above
mentioned fields cover fundamental research. Today, the majority of
studies found in literature use fuels and/or bulk ash, and try to relate
their findings to empirical correlations. However, computational

158

methods, such as CFD or DEM, require more fundamental data and
no empirical equations or indices.

An urgent need is a more sophisticated ash formation model
in CFD codes. This is particular challenging for lower-grade fuels
such as biomass or when fuel mixtures are fired, e.g. co-firing of
coal and biomass. Here, various chemical reactions and interac-
tions are possible leading to further complexity. The are numer-
ous studies using a constant mineral matter content per fuel
particle. Furthermore, it is assumed that mineral matter equals
ash content. Therefore, standalone tools should be developed
and subsequently be included in the code. There is also a need
for a more fundamental viscosity model considering the network
former theory. The applicability of viscosity models should be
widened for straw ashes (salt-rich and K-aluminosilicates), wood
ashes (Ca-rich), and SRF ashes (various compositions). An inter-
esting aspect,
is the particle cooling and deceleration within
boundary layers.

CFD methods should be used to accurately predict particle behav-
ior in the vicinity of heat exchanging surfaces. Here, the criterion of
Weber et al. [206] has to be considered when constructing computa-
tional grids. Furthermore, the cooling behavior and deformation of
molten droplets upon impact could be studies using volume of fluid
methods. Mechanistic models based on energy conservation should
be investigated and improved. A general method valid for liquids
and solids is desirable. This model could be implemented in DEM
simulations predicting ash deposition with a high level of detail.
More work is needed in order to predict the deposit structure, ero-
sion and shedding, as well as the collection efficiency of a porous
layer.

Appendix A

The following section summarizes different empirical viscosity
models in a chronological order. Equations are empirical in nature
and try to relate slag or ash composition to measured viscosity val-
ues. Values for the viscosity m are given in PaD
Xs, and for the temper-
ature T in K, if not stated otherwise.

Watt and Fereday model:. A simple correlation was proposed by Watt
and Fereday in 1969 [319]. It was developed for British coal ash slags
and uses an Arrhenius-type equation:

where slag components are expressed as normalized weight percen-
tages and sum up to 100% (SiO2 + Al2O3 + equiv. Fe2O3 + CaO + MgO
1⁄4 100). This correlation was suggested for high silica ( > 80%) or
high iron contents ( > 15%) [314].

S2 Correlation:. The so-called S2 correlation was also developed
for British coal ash slags with silica contents less than 55% and
iron oxide contents below 5% [314]. The equation is given by:

The silica ratio is defined by Sr 1⁄4 SiO2/(SiO2 + Fe2O3+CaO+MgO). Ash
oxides are in wt.% and sum up to 100%, and the Fe2O3 content is
expressed by Eq. (161).

Bottinga and Weill:. Bottinga and Weill [320] use the abundance of
viscosity data for the development of mathematical relation. The vis-
cosity of anhydrous silicate liquids is calculated using tabulated con-
stants Di in the following form:

log m 1⁄4

where xi is the molar fraction, and Di a tabulated constant of species
i. Di values are typically given for different levels of SiO2 and temper-
atures in the range of 1200(cid:1)1800 °C. They can be found e.g. in the
work of Vargas et al. [323].

Urbain Model:. Urbain [321] developed a frequently used equation.
They fitted measurements of SiO2-Al2O3-CaO-MgO systems to a
Weymann-type equation [314]:

Senior and Srinivasachar model:. The model proposed by Senior and
Srinivasachar [316] aims at the prediction of ash particle viscosities
in a broad temperature range. They therefore introduced a low and
high temperature regime and use the same type of equation for the
temperature-dependence as proposed by Urbain [321]:

This parameter describes the behavior of glass melts and their
network, explained in Section 3.3. A negative value of NBO/T
indicates that there is an insufficient number of modifier ions to
stabilize Al3þ and Fe3þ; which are known to act as amphoterics,
i.e. they either act as glass formers or modifiers. Modifiers are
known to disrupt the glass structure and thus tend to lower the
viscosity [316]. Coefficients ai in Eq. (175) are given in Table 28.
Values depend on the regime (low or high temperature) and on
the value of NBO/T. The coefficient b is derived by multiple regres-
sion analysis and can be calculated using the following equa-

tion [316]:

b 1⁄4 b0 þ b1d þ b2d2 þ b3N þ b4Nd þ b5Nd2 þ b6N2 þ b7N2d

þ b8N2d2 þ b9N3 þ b10N3d þ b11N3d2;

ð177Þ

where N is again the mole fraction of SiO2, d is computed as shown in
Eq. (171), and the coefficients bi can be taken from Table 26. The vis-
cosity is calculated using Eqs. (174)(cid:1)(177) for low and high temper-
ature coefficients. The higher value of m is then used as the viscosity
at a given temperature.

Browning Model:. Browning et al. [314] recently published an inter-
esting approach, in which they investigated 1715 data points for 117
slag compositions and came up with an empirical equation in the
form of:

log

The quantities of each component in Eq. (160) are mole fractions,
where all components sum up to unity.

Appendix B

Soda-lime glass is used to simulate ash for the development of a
particle sticking and rebound criterion. The chemical composition in
terms of oxides from different studies is given in Table 25. Only
minor differences are found and it can be assumed that glasses from
different studies behave similarly. The particle size distribution for
different size-fractions is given in Table 27. Particles are in a rela-
tively narrow window with the d50 being 43, 63 and 171 mm. Ash
fusion temperatures are determined for all three size-fractions. It
can be seen that the fluid temperature is almost identical. Further-
more, it is observed that smaller particle sizes lead to lower IDT and
ST. This is probably caused by a higher packing factor and thus an
increased sintering rate at lower temperatures. The conditions and
settings of different glass particle experiments from literature
(shown in Fig. 60), are summarized in Table 28. Srinivasachar et al.
[1] and Richter [222] used an uncooled probe composed of Al2O3.
Schulze et al. [201] used a cooled steel probe. The particle diameters
range from 40 up to 105 mm. Particle velocities range from relatively
low values of 0.33 up to 4 m/s. The soda-lime glass particle proper-
ties as a function of temperature are shown in Figs. 100(a)(cid:1)(f).
Measurements are not found for all properties over a broad tempera-
