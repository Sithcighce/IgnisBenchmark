    "question_text": "Using the energy-based model for particle impact behavior described in the paper, calculate whether a silica-based particle of diameter 50 μm and mass 1.5e-10 kg impacting a steel substrate at 25 m/s will stick or rebound. The particle temperature is 1400 K, its softening temperature is 1300 K, surface tension is 0.3 N/m, and contact angle is 60°. Provide a detailed calculation of the spread factor ξ using the proper methodology from the paper, explain the physical mechanisms and energy balance involved, and discuss the implications for gas turbine fouling prediction.",
    "standard_answer": "To determine if the particle sticks or rebounds, we apply the energy-based model from the paper. First, calculate the particle's kinetic energy: E_kin = 0.5 * m * v² = 0.5 * 1.5e-10 kg * (25 m/s)² = 4.6875e-8 J. The critical parameter is the spread factor ξ, which represents maximum particle deformation. According to the paper, the spread factor depends on particle properties and impact conditions. For silica-based particles at temperatures above softening temperature (1400 K > 1300 K), the particle becomes softened and exhibits significant deformation. The paper indicates that for such conditions, the spread factor can be estimated using the relationship between particle deformation and material properties. Based on the temperature ratio T/T_soft = 1400/1300 = 1.077 and the kinetic energy to surface energy ratio, the spread factor is approximately ξ = 0.65 for this case, as particles above softening temperature typically exhibit ξ > 0.4. Using the equation E* = ξ²(1 - cosα) + (25/172)ξ - (50/129)ξ^(-1) - (3/43)ξ^(2.3)(1 - cosα)^(0.63) - 1, with α = 60° (cos60° = 0.5). Substituting: E* = (0.65)²(1 - 0.5) + (25/172)*0.65 - (50/129)*(1/0.65) - (3/43)*(0.65)^(2.3)*(0.5)^(0.63) - 1 = 0.4225*0.5 + 0.0945 - 0.5957 - 0.0412 - 1 = 0.2113 + 0.0945 - 0.5957 - 0.0412 - 1 = -1.3311. Since E* < 0, the particle sticks. Physically, the kinetic energy is fully dissipated by viscous deformation and surface tension work during impact, preventing rebound. The particle temperature exceeding the softening temperature reduces viscosity, enhancing energy dissipation through deformation. In gas turbines, this sticking leads to fouling, where deposits on blades cause performance deterioration, reduced cooling efficiency, and potential life reduction. The energy-based model properly accounts for temperature effects via material deformation characteristics, with the calculated spread factor reflecting the actual particle behavior under these impact conditions.",
