    "question_text": "Based on the provided paper content, explain the detailed mechanisms and feedback processes involved in flame acceleration (FA) and deflagration to detonation transition (DDT) in hydrogen-air mixtures, focusing specifically on the coupling between flame, flow, and pressure waves that leads to detonation onset. Your explanation should describe the step-by-step physical processes and be supported by direct evidence from the paper.",
    "standard_answer": "The paper describes flame acceleration and deflagration to detonation transition as involving a complex coupling between flame, flow, and pressure waves. Initially, flame acceleration generates pressure waves that propagate through the unburned mixture. These pressure waves interact with the flow field, creating flow disturbances and turbulence. The enhanced turbulence increases flame surface area and burning rate, which further accelerates the flame. This creates a self-reinforcing feedback loop: flame acceleration → pressure wave generation → flow field disturbance → increased turbulence → enhanced flame acceleration. The paper specifically notes that 'FA and DDT mechanisms involve the coupling between flame, flow, and pressure waves, leading to a feedback loop that can result in detonation onset.' For hydrogen-air mixtures, this process is particularly dangerous due to hydrogen's unique properties, as 'Hydrogen's high flame propagation speed, a high propensity for flame acceleration, and a high sensitivity to detonation imply that any accidental release of hydrogen can be easily ignited and may lead to destructive explosions.' The coupling intensifies until conditions become favorable for detonation onset, where the flame transitions from subsonic deflagration to supersonic detonation through the formation of strong shock waves that compress and preheat the unburned mixture sufficiently for rapid combustion.",
