    "question_text": "Using principles from heat transfer and fluid mechanics, analyze how the structural architecture of Ti3C2Tx/PANI composite electrodes with volumetric capacitance of 1682 F cm⁻³ influences thermal behavior during electrochemical cycling. Explain the mechanisms by which the layered heterostructure design affects heat generation and dissipation, focusing on how material properties and structural features impact thermal management in energy storage systems.",
    "standard_answer": "The Ti3C2Tx/PANI composite electrode's thermal behavior during electrochemical cycling is governed by its layered heterostructure architecture. The high volumetric capacitance (1682 F cm⁻³) indicates efficient charge storage, but this also involves significant heat generation from resistive losses and electrochemical reactions. The composite structure mitigates thermal issues through several mechanisms: First, the conductive Ti3C2Tx monolayers provide excellent electronic conductivity, reducing resistive heating during charge/discharge cycles by facilitating efficient electron transport. Second, the confined PANI layers between MXene sheets create a heterostructure that prevents restacking, maintaining accessible surface area while potentially creating pathways for heat dissipation. The intimate contact between components enhances charge transfer kinetics, which minimizes localized heating by distributing current more uniformly. The free-standing film structure allows for efficient ion diffusion but may present challenges for thermal contact with current collectors, requiring careful thermal interface design. The heterostructure addresses MXene's inherent challenges with aggregation and stability, factors that could otherwise lead to uneven heat distribution and thermal degradation during cycling. From a fluid mechanics perspective, the layered architecture creates tortuous pathways that affect electrolyte flow and convective heat transfer, while the material's hydrophilicity enhances wetting and thermal coupling with the electrolyte.",
