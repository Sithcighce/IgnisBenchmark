Anthropogenic emissions of non-CO2 greenhouse gases such as fugitive methane contribute signifi-
cantly to global warming. A review of fugitive methane combustion mitigation and utilisation technol-
ogies, which are primarily aimed at methane emissions from coal mining activities, with a focus on
modelling and simulation of ultra-lean methane oxidation/combustion is presented. The challenges
associated with ultra-lean methane oxidation are on the ignition of the ultra-lean mixture and sus-
tainability of the combustion process. There is a lack of fundamental studies on chemical kinetics of
ultra-lean methane combustion and reliable kinetic schemes that can be used together with computa-
tional fluid dynamics studies to design and develop advanced mitigation systems. Mitigation of meth-
ane as a greenhouse gas calls for more efforts on understanding ultra-lean combustion. Recuperative
combustion provides a promising means for mitigating ultra-lean methane emissions. Progress is
needed on effective methods to ignite and to recuperate and retain heat for oxidation/combustion of
the ultra-lean mixtures. Catalysts can be very effective in reducing the temperatures required for oxi-
dation while plasmas may be utilised to assist the ignition, but thermodynamic/aerodynamic limits of
burning ultra-lean methane remain unexplored. Further technological developments may be focussed
on developing innovative capturing technology as well as technological innovations to achieve effec-
tive ignition and sustainable oxidation/combustion.

1. Background

PAddressing climate change associated with anthropogenic emis-
sions, either from human activities or from processes that have been
affected by human activities, of greenhouse gases (GHGs) is a global
challenge. Earth's climate is adversely affected as a result of the
emissions of GHGs with carbon dioxide (CO2) being the largest con-
tributor, mainly from the utilisation of fossil fuels in combustion
applications for energy conversion. Anthropogenic emissions of
non-CO2 greenhouse gases [1], such as methane (CH4), nitrous oxide
(ODSs), hydrofluorocarbons
(N2O), ozone-depleting substances
(HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) and
nitrogen trifluoride (NF3), also contribute significantly to warming.
In terms of the abilities to absorb available infrared radiation and
their persistence in the atmosphere, these non-CO2 GHGs are very
different from CO2. The global warming potential (GWP), defined as
the climate influence integrated over time and expressed relative to
that of an equivalent mass of CO2 emission, can be used to indicate
the effectiveness of these non-CO2 GHGs on global warming. All the
major non-CO2 GHGs have very large GWPs, e.g. CH4 has a value of
25, N2O has a value of 298, SF6 has a value of 22,800 and NF3 has a
value of 17,200 over a 100-year time horizon [2].

PIn the global combat against the adverse effects of GHG emis-
sions, non-CO2 GHGs must be taken into account, as non-CO2 GHGs
currently account for about one-third of total CO2-equivalent (CO2-
eq) emissions and 35(cid:1)45% of total climate forcing from all long-lived
GHGs (LLGHGs) [1]. Since most anthropogenic emissions of the non-
CO2 GHGs are linked to society's fundamental needs for food, energy
and industrial products, their emissions will continue to increase
and further warm the earth unless substantial efforts are undertaken
to reduce them worldwide. Although the major GHGs CO2, CH4, and
N2O occur naturally in the atmosphere, human activities have
greatly changed their atmospheric concentrations. From the pre-
industrial era ending at about 1750 to the present, concentrations of
these three greenhouse gases have increased globally by 43, 152,
and 20%, respectively [2]. This can cause a huge problem for the cli-
mate as the natural balance in our environment can be broken. For
example, the global carbon cycle is made up of large carbon flows
and reservoirs. Billions of tons of CO2 are absorbed by carbon “sinks”
such as oceans and living biomass, meanwhile they are emitted to
the atmosphere through various “sources”. When in equilibrium, the
emissions of CO2 to and the removals of CO2 from the atmosphere
are roughly balanced. Once the balance is broken, adverse or even
catastrophic consequences might happen. The climate can also be
adversely affected if the balances of non-CO2 GHGs are broken.

PAmong the various non-CO2 GHGs, N2O is mainly produced by
biological processes that occur in soil and water and by a variety of
anthropogenic activities in the agricultural, energy-related, indus-
trial and waste management fields. Agricultural soil management,
manure management, mobile source fuel combustion and stationary
fuel combustion have been the major common sources of N2O emis-
sions. Presently anthropogenic N2O emissions account for 3.1 § 0.8
GtCO2-eq per year [1], which is about 9% of the total radiative forcing
(the difference of solar irradiance absorbed by the Earth and energy
radiated back to space). The enhanced use of fertiliser could increase
N2O emissions, and most emissions of N2O are associated with feed-
ing the world's growing population. Because of the relevance to food
production, careful measures need to be taken when reducing the
N2O emissions. The N2O mitigation strategies [1] could include
more judicious application of fertiliser, increasing nitrogen uptake

Pefficiency by crops, expanding the use of nitrification inhibitors,
improving manure management strategies and expanding access to
sewage treatment [3(cid:1)5].

PIn the global effort to control non-CO2 GHG emissions, there was
a success associated with the significant reduction in ODSs of about
5 GtCO2-eq per year since 1990 [1], primarily because of the effec-
tiveness of the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the
Ozone Layer [6]. ODSs are man-made chemicals that damage the
ozone layer in the upper atmosphere (the stratosphere), including
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), halons, etc. Measures following the
Montreal Protocol such as banning the use of CFCs and limiting the
critical use of halons had certainly helped. HFCs and PFCs are fami-
lies of synthetic chemicals that do not deplete the stratospheric
ozone layer; thus, have been used as acceptable alternatives for
ODSs under the Montreal Protocol. These compounds, however,
along with SF6 and NF3, which are used in industrial sectors such as
electrical transmission and distribution, semiconductor manufactur-
ing, aluminium production, magnesium production and processing,
are potent greenhouse gases. In addition to having high GWPs, SF6
and PFCs have extremely long atmospheric lifetimes, resulting in
essentially irreversible accumulation in the atmosphere once emit-
ted. Although HFCs, PFCs, SF6 and NF3 are generally of small amounts
[1], their controlled use is certainly important in the combat against
global warming.

PIn the context of energy utilisation and GHG emissions, CH4 and
CO2 are of paramount importance. Due to the vast amounts of litera-
ture available on CO2 as a GHG, this review will not be focussed on
CO2 but on CH4, which is not only the predominant constituent of
natural gas as one of the major fossil fuel sources but also the second
largest GHG next to CO2. Presently CH4 is the most abundant non-
CO2 GHG in the atmosphere. Methane's atmospheric increase since
1750 implies anthropogenic emissions of 340 § 50 TgCH4 per year or
8.5 § 1.3 GtCO2-eq per year [1], which accounts for about 20% of the
total radiative forcing from all of the long-lived and globally mixed
GHGs, estimated at around 40(cid:1)50 GtCO2-eq per year. Agriculture
and fossil fuel exploitation together account for about 230 TgCH4 per
year or 5.8 GtCO2-eq per year, or two-thirds of all human-derived
CH4 emissions. The energy sector is a significant contributor to
anthropogenic methane emissions, at around 30% [7]. The main
activities causing methane emissions in the energy sector include oil
and natural gas systems, coal mining and biomass combustion.
Meanwhile, waste treatment and other industrial processes lead to
smaller amount of CH4 emissions.

PGreenhouse gas emissions including those from non-CO2 sources
are not entirely understood. Although the GHG emission inventory
(the percentage contributions of gases to anthropogenic GHG emis-
sions) provides a solid foundation for the development of a more
detailed and comprehensive strategy for the global action against
climate change, there are uncertainties associated with the emission
estimates. Acquiring a better understanding of the uncertainties
associated with inventory estimates will help to improve the overall
quality of the inventory and prioritise future efforts. Some of the cur-
rent estimates, such as those for CO2 emissions from energy-related
activities and other industrial processes, are considered to have low
uncertainties. For some other categories of emissions such as non-
CO2 GHG emissions, a lack of data or an incomplete understanding
of how emissions are generated increases the uncertainties associ-
ated with the estimates presented. Considering the inaccuracy in
obtaining the historic data over a global scale and uncertainties of
the inverse modelling, it is not unexpected that the inventory varies

Pin the literature especially their exact percentages [1,7]. The follow-
ing percentage data [7] can therefore only be taken as a rough guide-
line: CO2 74%, CH4 16%, N2O 9% and consumptions of CFCs, HFCs,
PFCs, SF6 1%. Nevertheless, the general trends are consistent: (1)
anthropogenic emissions of CO2 are the largest contributor to warm-
ing with CH4 the second, followed by N2O as the third; (2) among
the three main GHGs, large-scale industrial activities since 1750
have led to the highest percentage increase in CH4 concentrations in
the atmosphere followed by CO2, with N2O having the least amount
of percentage increase.

PThe GHG emissions of CH4 can evolve into a positive feedback
due to the interactions between human activities and natural pro-
cesses. The contribution of wetlands dominates natural CH4 emis-
sions at 150(cid:1)180 TgCH4 per year [8,9]. The sensitivity of natural CH4
emissions from wetlands to warmer, wetter climates suggests a pos-
itive feedback between emissions and climate change [1]. A doubling
of CO2 (corresponding to a global temperature change of 3.4 °C)
would result in an increase in wetland emissions of CH4 equal to
about one-third of present anthropogenic emissions of CH4 [10].
There is no doubt that CH4 is a significant driver of global climate
change, and more worryingly, it may be a key to positive feedback
loops involving Arctic permafrost and methane hydrates stored in
the oceans. The methane stored in the permafrost and clathrates
may be more than all other fossil fuels combined and is poised to be
atmospherically released as the Arctic temperature rises. As reported
in Nature [11], the cost of this methane release could be $60 trillion
and the outcome could be disastrous for the climate and world
economy.

PThe atmospheric concentration of CH4 depends on its generation
and loss mechanisms [1,12,13]. The loss of atmospheric CH4 is pri-
marily the result of methane oxidation by the hydroxyl radical
(OH*). This sink links the abundance of CH4 to the complex atmo-
spheric chemistry that influences OH* concentrations on a global
scale and creates a positive feedback between CH4 and its own abun-
dance [1]. In addition, the decreased OH* concentrations in the atmo-
sphere associated with increased CH4 concentrations can also
enhance climate influences of other GHGs such as HFCs. Further-
more, the atmospheric concentrations of CH4 interact with other
atmospheric species or pollutants. Short-lived substances such as
the combustion pollutant NOx (generic term to refer both NO and
NO2 compounds) and tropospheric ozone (which have lifetimes of
days to months) can affect climate forcing on longer timescales
through their influence on the concentrations of OH*, which in turn
affects the atmospheric concentrations of CH4. Methane as a GHG
has a much larger GWP and a much shorter lifetime than CO2, so
reducing CH4 emissions offers an important opportunity to have a
larger impact on GHG reduction and lessen future climate change.
The global warming potential can be massively reduced by oxidising
CH4 emissions into CO2. In addition, this process offers some poten-
tial to utilise the thermal energy from methane oxidation. In recent
years, methane emitted from coal mines has been successfully uti-
lised to generate electricity or to provide other forms of energy sup-
ply. The opportunities are particularly important for the energy
sector, where CH4 emissions from the extractive activities in the oil
and gas industry and coal mines are significant and relatively con-
centrated point source emissions.

PIn the energy sector, CH4 emissions are commonly encountered.
In coal mines, CH4 is formed during the coalification process and is
often contained in coal seams and adjacent rock strata. Unless it is
intentionally drained from the coal and rock, the process of coal
extraction liberates the coal mine methane (coalbed CH4) into the
mine workings, which poses a serious hazard to mine workers. To
ensure mine safety, fresh air is circulated through underground coal
mines using large ventilation systems to dilute in-mine concentra-
tions of methane to levels well below explosive limits. Mine safety
authorities in each country regulate these concentrations. Typically,

Pmethane concentrations in ventilation air range from 0.1% to 1.0%.
Mine operators employ large-scale ventilation systems to remove
coalbed methane from mine working areas. Although the concentra-
tion of ventilation air methane (VAM) in the exhaust is quite low,
the volume of mine air that ventilation systems move is very large.
In oil and gas extractive activities, methane emissions are also very
significant. Natural gas is mainly methane, some of which escapes
during the drilling, extraction, and transportation process. Such out-
breaks are also known as fugitive emissions.

in ventilation air,

PUnderground coal mines emitting large quantities of methane to
atmosphere is one of the major sources of CH4 in the atmosphere.
Approximately 70% of the methane emitted from coal mines is
released as VAM [7], accounting for about 6% of the total anthropo-
genic CH4 emissions. Unfortunately, due to the low methane concen-
tration (practically 0.1(cid:1)1.5%)
its effective
utilisation is considerably low. VAM has been investigated exten-
sively in recent years, e.g. Refs. [7, 14(cid:1)19]. Energy recovery may be
possible as the products of oxidation are emitted above the ambient
temperature. Commercially available technologies such as thermal
flow reversal reactors (TFRRs), catalytic flow reversal reactors
(CFRRs), catalytic monolith reactors (CMRs), catalytic lean-burn gas
turbines (GTs), recuperative gas turbines or regenerative thermal
oxidisers have been developed and proven to be useful in cutting the
VAM emissions. However, they are not very effective in dealing with
diluted methane/air mixtures with less than 0.5% fuel. There are sig-
nificant challenges in developing effective technologies because
most methane releases occur at extremely low concentration levels
that current technologies cannot effectively mitigate.

PThe extractive activities in the oil and gas industry including
shale gas generate about three times CH4 emissions of that from coal
mines [7] (more than 20% of the total anthropogenic CH4 emissions),
although the question of how much methane escapes from natural
gas and oil wells into the atmosphere remains unknown and chal-
lengeable. As with coal, the geological formation of oil can result in
large methane deposits that are sometimes released untreated, as
the oil is more economically valuable. During oil drilling and extrac-
tion, the trapped methane is released to the atmosphere. Targeted
collection of the methane related to oil extraction can vastly reduce
emissions from this source, with the collected methane being flared
off as carbon dioxide or even providing an additional fuel source
[20]. The loss of methane during natural gas extraction obviously
has both a direct greenhouse gas impact and an economic cost. The
recent emergence of fracking and shale gas has drawn increased
attention to this issue. It was reported [21] that 3.6%(cid:1)7.9% of the
methane from shale-gas production escapes to the atmosphere in
venting and leaks over the lifetime of a well, which is at least 30%
more than and perhaps more than twice as great as those from con-
ventional gas. Table 1 summarises the estimated contributions to
total radiative forcing of the non-CO2 GHGs, their major sources and
mitigation challenges. Apparently methane is the most important
non-CO2 GHG and its emissions include both point and non-point
sources, leading to difficulties for mitigation.

PMethane capture and utilisation in the energy sector can be a
very demanding task, involving technological and economical chal-
lenges. Options to reduce methane emissions from the oil sector
include flaring (burning off the CH4-containing flammable gas with-
out commercial purposes), direct use, and reinjection of methane
into oil fields [22]. Onshore oil operations usually inject the captured
methane into a pipeline. Offshore oil operations (oil platforms) tend
to use captured methane directly because flaring is economically
unattractive. Captured methane can also be injected into an oil pro-
duction field to enhance future oil recovery. Although the estimates
varied widely [23], CH4 emissions from the gas industry are much
larger than those from the oil industry. Emissions from the natural
gas supply chain are a key factor in determining the GHG footprint
of natural gas production and use. Current barriers to methane

Pcapture from oil and natural gas systems include environmental and
economic regulations, financial constraints, as well as the availability
and the cost of the technology. For methane emissions from coal
mines, depending upon the gas quality and volumes, the coal mine
methane could be used in a variety of ways [24], including natural
gas pipeline injection, power generation, VAM oxidation, power
electricity generators for the mine or local region, use as an energy
source such as co-firing in boilers, district heating, coal drying,
flaring, etc.

PAlthough the fugitive emissions from the oil and gas industry and
those from coal mines have differences in their origins and possible
capturing technologies, they bear some similarities in their utilisa-
tion. For CH4 emissions at relatively high concentrations, e.g. gas
drained from the coal seam before mining with 60(cid:1)95% CH4 and gas
drained from worked areas of the mine with 30(cid:1)95% CH4, utilisation
technologies are readily available [15], including purification for util-
ity gas supply, power generation and production of chemical feed-
stocks. For utility supply, the captured gas needs to be purified to a
high level since a minimum of 95% methane is often required to
meet the quality specifications for natural gas pipeline sales [15].
However, there is a significant challenge when the CH4 concentra-
tion is very low so that a purification technology becomes economi-
cally impractical. Under these circumstances, oxidation/combustion
at low concentrations will need to be employed to firstly convert
CH4 to CO2 for a much lower negative climate impact, and secondly
provide a possibility to utilise the thermal energy from the oxida-
tion/combustion. Currently there is a lack of available technology for
methane capture and utilisation for low concentration conditions.
The mitigation of these mixtures becomes important for large volu-
metric flows. For instance, applications such as coalmining, low con-
centration CH4 emissions have to be dealt with as VAM contributes
to most of the coalmine methane emissions from typical gassy coal
mines [15].

PThe greenhouse gas mitigation and utilisation of methane emis-
sions from the energy sector call for effective technologies. The main
aspects of the technical solutions such as oxidation/combustion
method, operational conditions, technical feasibility and engineering
applicability are all important, where advanced knowledge on low
concentration combustion is called for. This review deals with the
combustion mitigation of methane emissions under lean mixture
conditions outside the operational range of conventional combus-
tion systems. It is not focussed on experimental methods and com-
bustion diagnostics. Instead, it is intended to provide an overview of
the progress on the topic mainly from the perspectives of modelling/
simulation, where some basic information on the methodological
approaches is presented. The review addresses the scientific

Pchallenges of ultra-lean oxidation/combustion in Section 2, includ-
ing an overview of the ultra-lean methane combustion, chemical
kinetics, as well as the challenges of combustion modelling in
applications of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) for reacting
flows. Section 3 highlights the technological challenges of ultra-
lean methane oxidation/combustion, where the focus is on the
VAM mitigation technologies. Finally, Section 4 summarises the
subject with additional information, with concluding remarks on
combustion chemistry of ultra-lean methane mixtures and some
promising research directions.

2. Combustion mitigation and the scientific challenges

PThe combustion mitigation of fugitive methane not only reduces
the greenhouse gas effects by oxidising CH4 to CO2, but also provides
an opportunity to utilise the thermal energy from the methane oxi-
dation/combustion process. The scientific challenge of combustion
mitigation of ultra-lean methane is mainly associated with the fun-
damental understanding on the underlying physicochemical factors
affecting the flammability limits of methane/air mixture. Such mix-
ture will burn only if the fuel concentration lies within well-defined
lower and upper bounds determined experimentally, referred to as
flammability limits or explosive limits. These limits vary with tem-
perature and pressure, which are normally expressed in terms of
volume percentage at 25 °C and atmospheric pressure. The limits are
relevant to initiating combustion or explosion, as in an engine, or to
preventing it, as in uncontrolled explosions. Physicochemical factors
such as initial temperature and pressure have a major impact on the
methane/air mixture ignition and combustion, which can be affected
by external factors such as the presence of an external energy
source, e.g. a plasma source [25,26]. Chemical reactions are usually
characterised by the local temperature and pressure of the mixture.
However, when the mixtures ignite near the burn-off limits, the
effects of heat and mass transfer also play an important role and
must be taken into account. In particular, the presence of catalysts
can significantly alter the chemical pathways. These external factors
influence the chemical reactions for ignition and oxidation/combus-
tion, which in turn affects the flammability limits.

PAs the main challenge of CH4 mitigation and utilisation technol-
ogy is associated with low concentrations at large volumetric rates,
ultra-lean methane combustion is reviewed with focus on the chem-
ical kinetics, which is perhaps the least understood subject for this
topic. Because coal mining is one of the most significant sources of
fugitive CH4 emissions and the methane is conveniently contained
in a controlled airflow from the ventilation system, the development
of technology for mitigating VAM has been more straightforward to

Pimplement than the complex systems encountered in other indus-
tries such as gas and oil; thus, the following discussion is focussed
on VAM mitigation technologies. While the content deals with a spe-
cific application, it is also relevant to a wide range of other potential
applications of low concentration CH4 emissions including those
from the oil and gas industries and the agriculture sector as the fun-
damental science of ultra-lean methane oxidation/combustion
remains the same. In the context of VAM, since the existing litera-
ture is primarily on the design of the systems and experimental
studies, e.g. Refs. [7, 14(cid:1)19], the following sub-sections will focus on
the physicochemical modelling and numerical simulations of the
processes with a theoretical flavour, while Section 3 will discuss the
technological aspects. The oxidation/combustion of such mixtures is
assumed to occur in the lean premixed regime as the methane/air
flow can be considered to be well mixed and highly diluted with air.
Therefore, the study will be focussed on the modelling issues of lean
premixed combustion instead of combustion in diffusion or nonpre-
mixed flame as the premixed regime is a more relevant representa-
tion of the fugitive methane emissions targeted for reduction.

2.1. Ultra-lean methane combustion and the modelling approach

PUltra-lean methane combustion cannot be achieved using tradi-
tional combustion technologies because the thermal energy avail-
able in the system may not be sufficient to ignite the fuel and
sustain the chemical reactions. Special technologies such as porous
burners [27] may be considered to burn “ultra-lean” premixed fuel/
air mixtures, where the methane concentration is actually below the
lean flammability limit (5% methane by volume in air). By altering
the physicochemical factors such as increasing the initial tempera-
ture of the methane/air mixture, ignition and combustion may take
place at lower concentrations. The initial temperature for the oxida-
tion/combustion can be increased by purposely designed system to
retain heat such as recuperative combustion, by external factors
such as the presence of an external plasma energy source or the
presence of a catalyst, or a combination of these methods. Table 2
summarises the main technologies available for the mitigation/
utilisation of ultra-lean methane/air mixtures, together with the
principles of these technical measures and the scientific challenges
involved. It is worth noting that many of these technologies require
further developments, which are dependent on the scientific under-
standings underlying the methods.

P2.1.1. Overview of ultra-lean methane combustion

PFor oxidation/combustion of ultra-lean methane/air mixtures,
technologies are available for mitigation only or for combined miti-
gation and utilisation. In Table 2, porous burners, TFRRs, CFRRs and
CMRs are primarily for mitigation only where it is difficult to extract
useful energy from the system. On the other hand, gas turbine tech-
nologies can be used to extract energy for power generation in addi-
tion to the GHG mitigation effects. Porous burners operate on the
principle that the solid porous matrix serves as a means of recircu-
lating heat from the hot combustion products to the incoming reac-
tants, resulting in high burning velocities and extended lean
flammability limits. Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) can also be
incorporated into porous burners with EGR as the heat recuperation
mechanism. Although porous burners were shown to be able to burn
mixtures with a fuel concentration of only 1% [27], the practical
aspects of burner design and operation need careful attention in
order to achieve optimised burner performances for lean-burn appli-
cations. The important technical aspects include suitable materials
for the porous matrix, the length of the porous bed and the use of
“multi-section” designs where different porous materials are used in
each section. The incorporation of external heat exchangers to sup-
plement the heat recirculation provided by the porous matrix also
needs to be considered. There has been an extensive body of theoret-
ical and experimental research on combustion using porous burners
including the usage of catalysts, e.g. Refs. [28(cid:1)32]. However, the
controlling mechanisms still need to be better understood and the
development of reliable models specifically for ultra-lean combus-
tion in practical burners remains challenging.

PPorous burners are potentially an effective technology for ultra-
lean methane combustion. For the design of burners for practical
applications, numerical methods can be particularly useful in under-
standing the controlling mechanisms and for optimising the design
parameters.
In industrial applications such as VAM oxidation,
numerical simulations need to take into account the large gas vol-
umes in the flow solver and the low CH4 concentration combustion
in the chemical solver. In such a numerical analysis, energy equa-
tions in both the gas phase and solid phase (porous structures) need
to be solved with the radiative heat transfer taken into account. So
far, numerical studies of porous combustion are scarce. In a simpli-
fied one-dimensional study using a commercial package [33], the
chemistry and fluid flow were decoupled. A skeletal mechanism [34]
developed from a full mechanism at 10 atm, 1000 K and 1-vol% CH4
in moist air [35] was used. The need for an appropriate atmospheric
pressure chemical mechanism for the combustion simulation was

Phighlighted [33], because there was no suitable kinetics model avail-
able for ultra-lean atmospheric conditions.

POther technologies can also be used for lean CH4 oxidation/com-
bustion. In the case of VAM, ancillary uses include applications in
pulverised coal-fired power stations, hybrid waste coal/tailings/
methane combustion units, internal combustion engines and con-
ventional gas turbines, while principal uses include TFRR, CFRR and
CMR technologies, as well as lean-burn gas turbines [15]. Using a
pilot flame, VAM oxidation was numerically simulated by the
authors in a co-annular jet configuration using large eddy simulation
(LES) [36]. Effects of preheating and methane concentration were
examined in five computational cases. The results indicate that the
oxidation of the VAM can take place provided that the preheating
temperature is as high as 500 K for mixtures containing a low meth-
ane concentration of 0.5%. This encourages the continuation of
research on oxidation of ultra-lean methane mixtures with the use
of effective heat recovery systems that can deliver appropriate pre-
heating conditions for the incoming mixture.

PThe current technologies available for ultra-lean methane oxida-
tion/combustion are mainly based on increasing the temperature to
initiate chemical reactions, along with increasing the initial pressure
to extend the flammability limit. For applications where a high
throughput is required such as gas turbines, operating the burner at
elevated pressures might be an option. Currently, studies on ultra-
lean methane oxidation/combustion at elevated pressures are very
scarce, and are an area that needs further investigation. Although
the available technologies can deal with methane concentration
lower than 1%, they are generally ineffective when the methane con-
centration is too low. In this regard, a concentrator could be used to
enrich methane to levels that meet the requirements of lean-burn
methane mitigation and utilisation technologies [15]. A concentrator
may consist of an adsorber, a storage vessel for the adsorbent
medium with the adsorbed methane, a desorber and a transporting/
feeding system for the adsorbent medium. It can enrich 0.1(cid:1)0.9%
methane stream to a much higher concentration. In addition, the
concentrator could act as a buffer to cope with variations in methane
concentration and flow rate. However, the design and development
of cost-effective concentrators remain technically difficult.

PThe central issue to ultra-lean methane oxidation/combustion is
that ignition can take place at extremely low concentrations with
stable flame propagation. Ignition primarily depends on the reaction
pathways and transport properties, while stable flame propagation
also depends on fluid dynamic and thermodynamic characteristics
of the system. Apart from increasing the initial temperature of the
system, ignition can also be enhanced by changing the reaction path-
ways where the energy required to initiate reactions is lowered. Cat-
alytic combustion provides an effective means to enhance ignition
and flame propagation. For instance, the minimum CH4 concentra-
tion at which the reaction is sustainable or autothermic for the TFRR
technology is around 0.2%, which reduces to 0.1% in a corresponding
CFRR technology with the use of a catalyst [15]. Catalytic combustion
is usually a multi-step process involving diffusion to the catalyst sur-
face, adsorption onto the catalyst, reaction, and desorption of the
product species from the catalyst surface and diffusion back into the
bulk. Understanding of catalytic combustion depends primarily on
kinetic studies, which become very complicated when considering
heterogeneous reactions and remain an area requiring further
investigations.

PPlasma is also used as a new technology to increase the flame sta-
bility and achieve ultra-lean combustion [25]. It can produce active
species and heat and modify transport processes. New reaction path-
ways can be introduced into combustion systems with the presence
of plasma to modify the fuel oxidation pathways considerably;
accordingly ignition may take place at much lower fuel concentra-
tions. Over the last decade, significant progress has been made on
the understanding of the fundamental chemistry and dynamic

Pprocesses in plasma assisted combustion [25], while technological
applications such as combustor dynamics control [26] are also
drawing lots of attention. For the applications of plasma, new obser-
vations of plasma assisted ignition enhancement, ultra-lean combus-
tion, cool flames, flameless combustion, and controllability of plasma
discharge have been reported [25]. Plasma can electronically and
vibrationally excite species and the presence of plasma can alter the
kinetic pathways. Accordingly it can change the flammability limits
so that ignition and combustion may take place at relatively low
temperatures and low fuel concentrations. It has been found that
plasma can assist low temperature combustion, and affect flame
regime transition of the classical ignition S-curve and dynamics of
the minimum ignition energy [25]. Non-equilibrium plasma dis-
charge can also affect the fluid transport. However,
it remains
unclear what kind of plasma is the best option for combustion
enhancement in a given environment. Detailed plasma-combustion
chemistry is still not well understood. For ultra-lean mixtures,
whether a non-equilibrium plasma discharge can kinetically
enhance flame speed and flammability limit or can only promote
ignition is still debatable, among many unanswered fundamental
questions behind plasma-assisted oxidation/combustion.

PIn the context of low concentration CH4 oxidation/combustion,
the concept of moderate or intense low-oxygen dilution (MILD)
combustion [37] is relevant. The interest in MILD combustion has
been mainly driven by the needs for low emission and high effi-
ciency combustion. Despite that MILD combustion was originally
developed to oxidize mixtures without the formation of large tem-
perature gradients and localized heat sources, it has potential to oxi-
dize low concentration fuel mixtures. As MILD combustion was not
specifically developed for ultra-lean systems, there are important
differences in the flow and combustion characteristics. The most sig-
nificant difference is that the fuel concentration in MILD combustion
is much higher (typically not ultra-lean) and therefore, the technolo-
gies to oxidize the fuel are also different. However, similar
approaches can be used as the flow conditions after dilution of the
fuel are representative of the oxidation process of ultra-lean mix-
tures under preheating conditions [38(cid:1)40]. MILD combustion refers
to conditions where temperature of the reactant mixture is higher
than the autoignition temperature, while the temperature rise dur-
ing combustion is relatively low [37,38]. The concept of “autoigni-
tion temperature” helps to delineate the MILD regime boundary for
operational purposes [38]. In a premixed combustion system, auto-
ignition depends on complex chemical kinetics associated to partic-
ular operating conditions. Dilution influences the local composition
and the thermodynamic state. It can lead to possible changes in
chain branching reactions, and consequently it can affect the autoig-
nition characteristics of the original mixture. MILD combustion
involves low concentration reactant mixture and preheating of the
mixture, which can be affected by physical aspects such as flow con-
ditions (laminar or turbulent mixing), heat transfer characteristics,
thermodynamic properties and chemical aspects. MILD combustion
studies have been focussed on capturing and explaining the autoig-
nition properties and parameters affecting the sustainability of the
combustion process, where the flow and combustion characteristics
are different
from ultra-lean methane oxidation/combustion.
Goh et al. [39, 40] recently investigated the physicochemical mecha-
nisms of MILD (flameless) combustion under ultra-lean conditions.
Although the underlying physicochemical mechanisms for MILD
combustion remain to be fully investigated, a better understanding
is starting to emerge, which will assist the understanding and tech-
nology developments of ultra-lean methane oxidation/combustion.

Pessential step in the technological developments towards the reduc-
tion of greenhouse gases. In this context, CFD type of modelling and
simulations can play a significant part in optimising system designs.
Although experimental studies play a vital role in understanding the
mechanisms of ultra-lean methane combustion as well as design of
practical combustion systems, there are some difficulties when
exploring the thermodynamic/aerodynamic limits of burning low
concentration fuel mixtures in experiments. Some examples of tech-
nical limitations using experimental work are associated to the mini-
misation of heat losses from the system and maximisation of
fuel(cid:1)air mixing for oxidation. In this regard, numerical simulations
can be used to complement experimental studies by providing
insight and identifying key physicochemical processes. Parametric
numerical studies can also be used to optimise the practical design
of the system such as optimising the initial energy level to initiate
the oxidation or controlling the heat losses to the surroundings. In a
numerical study considering constant-pressure autoignition and
freely propagating premixed flames of cold methane/air mixtures
mixed with equilibrium hot products [38], evidence of significant
reactions involving intermediate species prior to the flame front was
shown in premixed flame simulations at high dilutions. At the pres-
ent time, the reacting flow of ultra-lean methane combustion has
not been broadly studied using numerical simulations.

PThe governing equations describing the reacting flow field in a
system are briefly given here to illustrate the modelling/simulation
procedures. For commonly encountered turbulent reacting flows,
the Favre-averaged equations for transient compressible flows can
be solved. The overall mass conservation in tensor form is given as:

PEquations (1)(cid:1)(4) constitute the basic governing equations for
turbulent reacting flows. However, they are not a closed set that can-
not be solved without modelling closures for the Reynolds stress,
turbulent fluxes and the chemical source terms _vk and Sh . As there

Pis a vast amount of literature available on turbulence modelling, e.g.
Ref. [41], the modelling of the Reynolds stress and turbulent fluxes
will not be discussed herein. In the traditional CFD approach based
on Reynolds-averaged Navier(cid:1)Stokes (RANS) modelling, turbulent
combustion can be modelled using a variety of models, e.g. Ref. [42].
The most significant challenge in physicochemical modelling is
related to the chemical kinetics, which needs to be coupled with
modelling of turbulent flows. Extra difficulties are not expected for
turbulence modelling of ultra-lean methane combustion, but atten-
tion is needed for modelling the chemical kinetics and turbulence-
chemistry interaction under ultra-lean conditions. In practical CFD
simulations, the calculations associated with the chemistry can be
very time consuming, especially when one uses a detailed mecha-
nism considering a large number of species. For instance, the conser-
vation of chemical species presented Nspecies in Eq. (3) will require
individual equations with the number of and there will be a very
large number of chemical source terms related to the reaction rates.
Inevitably such a simulation will be very expensive in terms of
computational costs. Furthermore, in finite-rate chemical kinetic
schemes, Arrhenius formulas are usually employed for the reaction
rates of individual reactions. Accounting for detailed chemistry
requires having the temporal and spatial resolution to solve the fast
and slow reactions as well as the formation of short-lived reactive
species such as radicals that usually occur in thin zones. This contrib-
utes to stiff the governing equations and leads to numerical difficul-
ties. This disparity of scales in turbulent combustion applications
leads to the development of techniques to reduce the computational
cost associated to the fluid mechanics and chemistry parts sepa-
rately. From the fluid mechanics point of view, steady and unsteady
flow approaches can be used to describe the fluid flow. Steady
approaches as the ones used in RANS models are developed based
on temporal- or ensemble-averaged equations to reduce the compu-
tational cost, while unsteady flow approaches such as LES or DNS
are more accurate as most or all the scales are solved but they are
more computationally intensive. From the chemical point of view,
reduced schemes designed for particular operating conditions based
on few steps can be used or one can apply chemical scale separation
processes as the ones used in flamelet models. Flamelet models are
based on chemistry tabulation, where the combustion chemistry
information is stored in pre-calculated look-up tables so the source
terms can be directly read or interpolated from the database while
there is no need to solve equations for the species. Although the
method is attractive computationally, one has to apply it with cau-
tion. The data tables are usually obtained based on many different
parameters such as the original detailed mechanism, pressure, local
temperature, heat loss, strain, pre-defined shape functions for turbu-
lence-chemistry interactions, among others. Computational models
based on chemistry tabulation must be used with caution because
the thermochemical properties may not resemble the flow under
consideration.

PFor modelling and simulation of combustion, the physicochemi-
cal modelling involves coupled chemical kinetics with turbulent
effects when the flow is in the turbulent regime. Turbulence-chemis-
try interaction has to be addressed. Under ultra-lean conditions, the
simple mixed-is-burnt model (assuming that the rate of combustion
is determined solely by mixing processes, which was widely used in
the simulations of industrial combustors and furnaces) is not valid.
Because of the importance of extinction/re-ignition in ultra-lean CH4
combustion, the reacting flow will be intrinsically unsteady. In
this context, LES will be a more suitable tool than averaged RANS
approaches. In LES, sub-grid scale (SGS) modelling for turbulence
and turbulent combustion is essential, which is a continuously
developing area. LES is a promising approach and may become a reli-
able modelling tool for numerical simulations of practical reacting
flows with unsteadiness. In LES, the modelling uncertainty is inevita-
bly associated with the inaccuracy of the SGS model. Nevertheless,

Pultra-lean conditions do not bring significant extra difficulties to SGS
modelling for turbulence and turbulent combustion, apart from the
requirements on predicting extinction/re-ignition with high fidelity.
POne of the commonly used turbulent combustion modelling
methods is the eddy dissipation concept (EDC) [43, 44] for turbu-
lence-chemistry interaction. EDC gives an expression for the mean
_vk in Eq. (3). The model assumes that chemical reac-
reaction rate,
tions occur where the dissipation of turbulence energy takes place,
that is, in the fine structures, which have characteristic dimensions
that are of the order of the Kolmogorov scales. These structures are
not evenly distributed in time and space but are concentrated in cer-
tain regions (fine-structure regions) that occupy a fraction of the
flow. Because of its simplicity, EDC has been used in engineering tur-
bulent combustion modelling with a number of approaches for dif-
ferent scenarios such as the fast chemistry, detailed chemistry and
local extinction approaches [42]. In turbulence modelling of the
reacting flow field of ultra-lean methane combustion, the EDC model
may prove not to be the most suitable one. It was chosen here to
illustrate the turbulence-chemistry coupling in reacting flow simula-
tions, which is a key issue in numerical simulations of ultra-lean
combustion. The fast chemistry approach is the simplest in terms of
formation, which is obtained by assuming that there is sufficient res-
idence time in the fine structures. It is further assumed that combus-
tion can be represented by a single irreversible one-step global
reaction of the form
1 kg Fuel Fð Þ þ rF kg Oxidiser Oð Þ ! 1 þ rF

Þkg Products Pð Þ

ð5Þ

ð

where rF is the mass-based stoichiometric oxidiser-to-fuel ratio.
Using the extended approach of EDC [42], it is also possible to use
more than one global reaction, e.g. including the formation of carbon
monoxide (CO) in CH4 combustion, the reactions considered can be
given as
CH4 þ 1:5 O2 ! CO þ 2 H2O; CO þ 0:5 O2 ! CO2

ð6Þ

PIn Eq. (6), stoichiometric coefficients are used to establish the
mole ratio between reactants and products. The fast chemistry
approach has the advantage of being easy to implement. However,
the assumptions made are normally violated in ultra-lean conditions
where local extinction might take place and the chemical mecha-
nisms can be rather complex. For oxidation/combustion of ultra-
lean CH4 mixtures, finite-rate chemical kinetics has to be considered.
In the EDC detailed chemistry approach, finite-rate chemical kinetics
are taken into account by treating the fine structures as constant-
pressure and adiabatic homogeneous reactors. The EDC local extinc-
tion approach, assuming extinction takes place in the turbulent fine
structures, applies a database of pre-calculated chemical time scales
containing the influence of chemical kinetics. It showed significantly
better results than the fast chemistry approach while having a com-
parably small computational cost [42]. An extension of the EDC
model to account for local extinction seems to be a promising
approach to model ultra-lean methane combustion, but further
research needs to be conducted to assess its applicability and accu-
racy on practical cases.

PFor numerical simulations of ultra-lean combustion, finite-
rate chemical kinetics needs to be accounted for, in conjunction
with turbulence and turbulent combustion modelling when the
flow is in the turbulent regime. When oxidation/combustion
takes place at highly diluted conditions, unsteadiness such as
ignition, local extinction and re-ignition plays a major role in the
combustion dynamics. In terms of capturing the flow unsteadi-
ness, LES is significantly more advantageous than RANS approach
based on time- or ensemble-averaging. LES of turbulent combus-
tion has made significant progress in the last several decades, e.
g. Refs. [45(cid:1)48].

PTurbulent combustion modelling is a vast area with a large num-
ber of approaches, e.g. the Bray(cid:1)Moss(cid:1)Libby theory is broadly used

Pwhich is a second-order closure with special closure approximations
appropriate to flame-sheet combustion [49]. Although turbulent
combustion modelling still evolves with the advances on relevant
branches of fluid flow and combustion sciences, it does not rep-
resent a specific challenge on the flow dynamics side for ultra-
lean combustion. Chemical kinetics modelling represents the
largest challenge for numerical simulations of ultra-lean combus-
tion, since the numerical simulations need to accurately predict:
(1) under which conditions the mixture ignites; and (2) under
which conditions the oxidation/combustion will be sustainable.
The chemical kinetics also affects the turbulence(cid:1)chemistry
interactions.

PThe progress in MILD combustion can help to better understand
ultra-lean CH4 oxidation/combustion. As a promising technology to
reduce pollutant emissions and to improve combustion efficiency, a
combination of air preheating and fuel dilution with combustion
products of low oxygen concentration is the main feature of MILD
combustion. It has been shown that the reaction mechanism used in
CFD simulations affects the numerical results of natural gas combus-
tion in the MILD combustion regime [50]. The study shows how sev-
eral global reaction mechanisms obtained different nitrogen oxide
and carbon monoxide levels during the combustion process. The tur-
bulence(cid:1)chemistry interaction was modelled using the EDC. The
results showed that the temperature prediction was satisfactory
using the global reaction mechanisms, but a severe over-prediction
of the CO and H2 concentration occurred due to the use of simplified
reaction schemes. The study highlighted that the EDC turbulence(cid:1)
chemistry interaction model may be suitable for the calculation of
MILD combustion processes, but the chemical kinetic mechanisms
need careful attention. Modelling MILD combustion is very likely to
require accurate descriptions of turbulence(cid:1)chemistry interactions.
In this context, the transported probability density function (PDF)
method for premixed turbulent flames [51] provides an advanced
modelling approach.

PIn understanding the mechanisms of MILD combustion, direct
numerical simulation (DNS) can be a useful tool. DNS resolves all the
relevant time and length scales in the flow field using highly accu-
rate numerical methods and significant amounts of computing
resources. It can prove to be a powerful tool in gaining a deeper
understanding of MILD combustion especially when one examines
the thermodynamic/aerodynamic limits of burning a low concentra-
tion fuel mixture. In the study of MILD combustion, advanced CFD
approaches such as LES and DNS are becoming increasingly impor-
tant, e.g. Refs. [52, 53]. As LES and DNS are time-dependent three-
dimensional (3D) simulations, the computational costs associated
with these methods can be relatively high.

PIn general, the fluid flow and chemical kinetics are coupled
together in combustion applications. For computer modelling and
numerical simulation of ultra-lean CH4 oxidation/combustion,
the most significant challenge is associated with obtaining a high-
fidelity representation of the combustion chemistry. The use of
detailed chemistry may be necessary as the kinetics at ultra-lean
conditions can be rather complex, while a reduced mechanism such
as a skeletal mechanism may significantly reduce the computa-
tional costs without losing much of the accuracy. The skeletal
mechanism for combustion within the porous burner described
by Jazbec et al. [34] comprises 28 reactions and 12 species,
which was developed specifically for use in CFD analysis and
enabled the viability of the porous domain thermal transport
model to be demonstrated for the high pressure level of 10 atm.
Since the chemical mechanisms governing the oxidation process
at such low concentrations have not been fully understood, reli-
able chemical kinetic models specifically developed for ultra-lean
methane combustion are still in demand. In the following sub-
the chemical kinetics for CH4 oxidation/combustion
section,
especially for ultra-lean conditions is discussed.

2.2. Chemical kinetics for ultra-lean methane oxidation/combustion

PIn computational studies such as a CFD of ultra-lean methane
oxidation/combustion, the chemical species source/sink terms as
well as the energy source term have to be provided for the closure
of the governing equations, such as those shown in Eqs. (3) and (4).
These terms can be readily provided if
the chemical kinetic
schemes are known. In the following, some background on combus-
tion chemistry for general methane oxidation, chemical description
of ultra-lean methane oxidation, effects of catalysts, as well as
reduced chemical kinetics for ultra-lean methane oxidation are
briefly summarised.

P2.2.1. General background on combustion chemistry for methane
oxidation

PThis sub-section provides some basic background on methane
oxidation kinetics, which serves as the basis for kinetic studies at
ultra-lean conditions. The chemical kinetics for the oxidation of
methane has been of primary interest in combustion science, since
methane is one of the main hydrocarbon fuels and one of the most
important energy sources. The understanding of chemical kinetics
governing the combustion of hydrocarbon fuels has been the subject
of many studies since the late 1970s [54(cid:1)56]. Studies were focussed
on describing the chemical pathways leading to the formation
of pollutants and radicals to improve efficiency and safety with
reduced emission in combustion systems. The oxidation of hydrocar-
bon fuels can be systematically described using levels or hierarchies
in reaction pathways of fragments of the initial fuel [56]. The kinetics
can be split in individual chemical kinetics subsets, which in tradi-
tional hydrocarbons correspond to the chemistry of H2(cid:1)(cid:1)O2, CO/CO2,
C1(cid:1)(cid:1)Cn hydrocarbon kinetics (where the subscript indicates the
hydrocarbon order) and the chemistry of formaldehyde CH2O, an
intermediate species in most hydrocarbon oxidation processes [56].

PIn practice, most hydrocarbon fuels have considerable similarities in
their combustion characteristics (major species, burning velocities
and autoignition delay times) for practical fuels because the oxida-
tion is dominated by common key elementary reactions [57(cid:1)60].
Fundamental branching reactions at high temperatures are:
H þ O2 ) O þ OH

ð7aÞ

CO þ OH ) CO2 þ H

ð7bÞ

While at low-intermediate temperatures, the branching mechanism
is different and is mainly related to the formation and decomposi-
tion of hydrogen peroxide [56].

PThe arrows indicate the direction of the chemical reaction con-
sidered, where “)” stands for irreversible reactions and “,” for
reversible reactions.

PMethane is the main compound in natural gas (above 90%),
which is also an important by-product in many industrial processes
and an intermediate product in the oxidation of more complex
fuels. As it is the most commonly used gaseous fuel, methane com-
bustion chemistry has been extensively investigated. The reaction
mechanism of methane follows a complex scheme and usually can
be decomposed into two main pathways depending on whether
the fuel burns in lean or rich conditions [56,57,59]. For very rich
fuel conditions, the oxidation pathways require full description of
C1 to C4 paths, while for lean or stoichiometric conditions C1 to C2
subsets are sufficient to describe the chemical structure of the oxi-
dation process. The main chemical pathways in most methane def-
lagrations at conditions of practical interest in combustion systems
(near stoichiometric conditions) are shown in Fig. 1. Although the
pathways shown in Fig. 1 are not expected to be fully applicable for
ultra-lean methane oxidation/combustion, they can be taken as the
reference point for the study of chemical kinetics under this
extreme condition.

PThe thermal decomposition of methane to form the methyl radi-
cal occurs through hydrogen abstraction by means of the following
reactions:

where M represents an energetic third body, from which energy is
transferred during a molecular collision. In the above, reaction (8a)
is dominant and the most important initiation reaction [63], and
reactions (8b(cid:1)e) exhibit substantial non-Arrhenius behaviour for
the range of temperatures of interest in most combustion applica-
tions [56]. These reactions are critical to predict autoignition and
become less important for steady flames. Therefore, these reactions
should be taken into account when burning highly diluted mixtures
as they influence the autoignition delay time of the fuel and indicate
the operability of the fuel for certain operating conditions.

PThe consumption of the methyl radical CH3 occurs via the global

oxidation step given by reaction:
CH3 þ O2 , CH2O þ OH

HCO þ M ) CO þ H þ M

ð11hÞ
PReactions (11a(cid:1)h) are fast reactions and most intermediate radi-

cals are consumed very rapidly.

PThe final oxidation of carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide is a
slow process and coupled to the H2(cid:1)(cid:1)O2 mechanism. The main reac-
tions are:
CO þ O þ M , CO2 þ M

ð12aÞ

CO þ O2 , CO2 þ O

ð9aÞ

CO þ OH , CO2 þ H

or more precisely by the OH or HO2 radicals to form CH2O and CH3O.
For moderate temperatures and high pressure, the formation of
hydroperoxyl radicals governs the stabilization of the H2(cid:1)(cid:1)O2 sub-
mechanism and CH3 and HO2 are dominant species in the radical
pool influencing phenomena such as autoignition. The reaction paths
include the thermal decomposition of the methylhydroperoxide
CH3OOH to form CH2O and CH3O and are given by the following
reactions, although hydrogen abstraction forming CH4 and O2 can
also occur.
CH3 þ HO2 ) CH3O þ OH

ð9b:1Þ

CH3 þ HO2 ) CH2O þ H2O

ð9b:2Þ

CH3 þ HO2 ) CH3OOH

ð9b:3Þ
PReaction (9b.1) is most likely to occur for temperatures in the
range of most combustion systems and pressures up to 100 bar. The
reaction of the methyl radical with hydroxyl radicals is also a main
chemical pathway for the oxidation of CH3, and several kinetic paths
are possible depending on temperature and pressure. The principal
reaction paths are:
CH3 þ OH ) CH3OH

ð9c:1Þ

CH3 þ OH ) CH2 þ H2O

CH3 þ OH ) H2CO þ H2

CH3 þ OH ) CH2OH þ H

CH3 þ OH ) CH3O þ H
where reaction (9c.1) competes with reactions (9c.2)(cid:1)(9c.5).

PThe additional reaction pathways of chain reaction leading
to the formyl radical and eventually the carbon monoxide by

CO þ HO2 , CO2 þ OH

ð12dÞ
PThe oxidation of methane and any hydrocarbon require the pres-
ence of a radical pool of H, OH, O and HO2 that allow the aforemen-
tioned elementary reactions to take place. This is given by the chain-
branching, chain-propagating and chain-breaking reactions of the
H2(cid:1)(cid:1)O2 mechanism [56]. Under ultra-lean conditions, the HO2 chem-
istry is of particular importance, since it reduces the system reactiv-
ity. The principal HO2 formation reaction at low temperature is
H þ O2 þ M ) HO2 þ M

ð12eÞ
PIn this reaction, M represents a third body of any species. This
reaction becomes an inhibiting reaction when it takes place at high
temperatures because it competes with the reaction (7a) H + O2 ) O
+ OH.

PThe elementary steps are gathered together forming detailed
chemical kinetics mechanisms that represent the combustion chem-
istry of any hydrocarbon fuel. These reaction mechanisms are
designed to provide detailed information on the transformation of
reactants into products at the molecular level and predict heat
release, products and radicals at varied conditions of temperature,
pressure and fuel dilution.

PThere are a number of well-established detailed chemical kinet-
ics mechanisms for methane oxidation. This section introduces sev-
eral detailed reaction mechanisms that represent the state-of-the-
art in chemical kinetics for methane oxidation. The selection is not
exhaustive, but includes some important reaction mechanisms used
in the combustion community. These schemes can be used for gen-
eral use under a wide range of operating conditions, but users should
carefully check the actual conditions for which they are designed
before applying them for particular applications.

PThe largest contribution to provide reliable data for methane oxi-
dation (and also for natural gas) has been the Gas Research Institute
initiative developed at The University of California at Berkeley, Stan-
ford University, The University of Texas at Austin, and SRI Interna-
tional developing the GRI-Mech [64]. The GRI-Mech 3.0 (the last
update) is a chemical scheme comprising 325 chemical reactions
and 53 reactive species that provide rate reactions and thermochem-
ical data for temperature in the range of 1000(cid:1)2500 K, and pressure
from 1.0 to 1000 kPa, with equivalence ratios from 0.1 to 5 in

Ppremixed systems for methane and natural gas. The GRI-Mech
includes a comprehensive set of experiments such as shock-tube
ignition delay, flow and stirred reactor data providing species profile
measurements and laminar flame speed for all conditions. A small
subset with 38 species and 190 reactions so-called RAMEC based on
the early development of GRI-Mech (GRI-Mech 1.2) [65] was devel-
oped using additional reactions that are important in methane oxi-
dation at lower temperatures [59].

PA well-established reaction mechanism widely used in the com-
bustion community for hydrogen and also for hydrocarbon flames is
the San Diego mechanism [66]. It comprises 357 reversible reactions
and 100 chemical species, and includes fuels from JP10 up to n-hep-
tane. For the particular case of methane oxidation, a reduced subset
from the entire San Diego mechanism can be used and has been
extensively tested and validated for rich conditions [67] and general
applications [68]. Another recent detailed scheme for methane com-
bustion requiring 134 reversible reactions and 30 reactive species
[69] was also developed by some of the authors.

PThe Leeds mechanism has also been used to describe the chemi-
cal kinetics of methane combustion along with ethane and ethylene
flames in the work by Hughes et al. [70]. This mechanism makes use
of 351 chemical reactions with 37 species and the overall perfor-
mance is rather similar to the GRI-Mech, although it uses different
elementary reactions [59]. The mechanism proposed by Dagaut et al.
[71] for methane combustion in a jet-stirred reactor has also been
widely used in many combustion applications, so has been the
mechanism by Davis et al. [72]. Ranzi et al. [73] also developed a
detailed kinetic mechanism that has been successfully employed for
the combustion of hydrocarbon fuels. This scheme provides detailed
chemical data to the C2 chemistry and comprises 70 species with
1600 reactions.

PA more comprehensive analysis of detailed schemes can be found
in the work by Westbrook and Dryer [56], and more recently by Sim-
mie [59] and Renzi et al. [74] among many others. For brevity, the
details of these models are not provided herein.

PReduced mechanisms are particularly valuable in CFD studies of
reacting flows. Many reduced chemical schemes have been proposed
in the literature to describe methane oxidation. These reduced
schemes are usually required for CFD calculations on industrially rel-
evant simulations in order to reduce the computing time of the
chemical calculation. The reduction process can be achieved by
assuming a limited range of operating conditions and assuming
steady state of some intermediate species. From the early work of
Westbrook and Dryer [56,75], in which a compilation of one-step
and two-step chemical schemes were presented for several fuels of
interest, a large number of these schemes have appeared and contin-
uously appear in the literature. This is a very active area of research,
since the operating conditions of practical systems are constantly
changing and advanced techniques for chemical reduction are devel-
oped.

PSeveral reduced schemes from the GRI-Mech were proposed by
Chen and co-workers [76,77] for methane oxidation. These schemes
include a 10-step, 12-step, 13-step, 15-step and 16-step reaction
schemes that have been extensively used in the combustion research
community. As an example, the 12-step scheme is given by:
O2 þ 2CO , 2CO2

ð13aÞ

H þ O2 þ CO , OH þ CO2

H2 þ O2 þ CO , H þ OH þ CO2

HO2 þ CO , OH þ CO2

PPeters and co-workers [78] developed a broadly-used 4-step
reduced scheme for methane oxidation accounting for C1 and C2
schemes.
CH4 þ 2H þ H2O ) CO þ 4 H2

ð14aÞ

CO þ H2O , CO2 þ H2

2H þ M , H2 þ M

ð14bÞ

ð14cÞ

O2 þ 3 H2 , 2H þ 2 H2O

ð14dÞ
PJones and Lindsted [79] also developed a 4-step reaction scheme
valid for methane oxidation given by the following global reactions:
CH4 þ 1
2

O2 ) CO þ 2 H2

ð15aÞ

CH4 þ H2O ) CO þ 3 H2

H2 þ 1
2

O2 , H2O

ð15bÞ

ð15cÞ

CO þ H2O , CO2 þ H2

ð15dÞ
PThe scheme reproduces the flame speed, species profiles and
flame thickness with sufficient accuracy for standard equivalence
ratios. However, it was shown that this well-known mechanism led
to a severe over-prediction of the CO and H2 concentration because
of the simplified reaction path when it was used to predict the oxi-
dation of natural gas in the MILD combustion regime [50].

PSeveral reduction schemes for methane oxidation under general
combustion conditions [80] and lean conditions [81] were also pro-
posed based on steady state approximation of intermediate species.
A 4-step reduction scheme was first proposed and then, further
reduced to a 2-step mechanism for conditions relevant to gas turbine
operations. The 4-step scheme is given by:
CH4 þ 2OH ) CO þ H2O þ 2 H2

ð16aÞ

H2 þ O2 , 2OH

2OH þ H2 , 2 H2O

ð16bÞ

ð16cÞ

CO þ H2O , CO2 þ H2

ð16dÞ
PIn the meantime, the 2-step mechanism is represented by the fol-

lowing two global reactions:
CH4 þ 3

O2 ) CO þ 2 H2O

CO þ 1

PReduced kinetic schemes for methane oxidation were also inves-
tigated by Bibrzycki and Poinsot for methane/air and oxyfuel com-
bustion [82]. The 2-step mechanism 2S-CM2 was compared to the
Jones and Lindsted mechanism [79] and then, adjusted to have bet-
ter predictions for oxyfuel and rich conditions in combustion with
air (2S-CM-JB1). Further corrections were made for lean methane
flames (2S-CM-JB2) and better correlation with the reference GRI-

PMech 3.0 was obtained. Other reduced mechanisms for methane oxi-
dation have also been proposed, e.g. those by Lu and Law [83] or
Wada et al. [84] and more recently by Nikolau et al. [85] for diluted
mixtures with large water vapour content.

PThe applicability of these reduced schemes for oxidation of ultra-
lean methane mixtures still has to be assessed as most of these
mechanisms were developed for particular operating conditions.
Some important aspects to be determined are the ignition delay
time and flame propagation predicted by these schemes, since the
reaction sets might not be appropriate when the radical pool of
some species is rather low or the dilution overcomes certain values.
This is an important topic that requires further investigation.

P2.2.2. Chemical description of ultra-lean methane oxidation

PWhile the chemical kinetics of most practical fuels under stan-
dard burning conditions is relatively well understood, as described
before, the study of chemical kinetics of mixtures in unconventional
burning conditions (e.g. highly diluted mixtures or ultra-lean condi-
tions,
low temperature and high pressure among others) still
requires further research. In the case of ultra-lean mixtures, the
combustion process is rather different from traditional flames.

PThe autoignition delay time, which can be defined as the time
required for a well-mixed fuel and oxidiser mixture to ignite at cer-
tain steady temperature and pressure conditions, is found to be a
key aspect to evaluate the burning characteristics of ultra-lean mix-
tures and some work has been devoted to this [86,87]. The charac-
teristics of the methane autoignition under atmospheric pressure
and different preheating temperatures and diluents were investi-
gated by Sabia et al. [88]. Their work showed different chemical
kinetic pathways for methane autoignition in which the reactivity of
the oxidation process changes. The local mixture temperature not
only influences the reaction channels, but also the chemical kinetics
governing the autoignition process. At the low temperature range (T
= 850 K), the main pathway of methane oxidation after dehydroge-
nation of CH4 is the formation of CH3O and CH3O2 that eventually
leads to CH2O, HCO and finally CO. At the intermediate temperature
range (T = 975 K), the reaction rates increase substantially with
respect to the low temperature ignition and similar chemical path-
ways are observed, although alternative recombination routes to
ethane and the formation of formaldehyde and OH radical also occur.
At the high temperature range (T = 1150 K), the weight of the chemi-
cal routes changes and the ignition occurs mainly due to the chain
branching reaction H + O2 , OH + O and the thermal decomposition
of CH3O2. C2 hydrocarbons are formed at such conditions.

PAs already mentioned, the concept of MILD combustion may help
to understand the kinetics of burning ultra-lean mixtures. In MILD
combustion, the oxidation process takes place by autoignition allow-
ing low-calorific fuels to be easily oxidised [89]. The MILD regime
occurs when the mixtures increase their flammability limit under
preheating conditions [37], and are characterised by longer kinetic
times governed by particular reaction paths different from conven-
tional premixed or diffusion flames [87]. The chemical kinetics can
be represented by the fast kinetics for oxidative undiluted conditions
and slow kinetics for low temperature self-ignition regime [37]. An
important aspect of MILD combustion, which also relates to the oxi-
dation of highly diluted mixtures, is that combustion can only be
possible after preheating the reactants [37,38]. The heat released
after the oxidation is not sufficient to self-sustain the reaction pro-
cess and without preheating the reactants, the combustion process
slows down until quenching. A study of MILD combustion for meth-
ane rich mixtures was initially developed by de Joannon et al. [90],
but more recent publications for lean conditions have also been
reported in a one-dimensional flow reactor [86,88]. The oxidation
process is influenced by the heat losses to the surroundings and
therefore, the characteristics of the experimental facilities where the
measurements are performed must be taken into account [87,91,92].

PThe work by Sabia et al. [87] reported some interesting reactivity
behaviours for the oxidation of methane under diluted conditions in
the MILD regime named: slow combustion/pyrolysis, pyrolysis, tran-
sitional combustion, dynamic behaviour, combustion and slow com-
bustion.
It showed the existence of rather different chemical
pathways for methane oxidation depending on the flow conditions.
Maps of reactivity behaviour for C/O mixtures under different tem-
peratures and dilution levels at atmospheric pressure were reported
and analysed.

PThree main chemical pathways govern the methane oxidation
process: oxidation, recombination and pyrolysis. For lean conditions,
the oxidation is the principal chemical pathway and is promoted by
the H2(cid:1)(cid:1)O2 branching reactions. The recombination channel releases
radicals that enhance the system reactivity at relatively low temper-
atures. As the mixture temperature increases, the pyrolytic channel
is activated promoting the C2 pathway and reducing the system
reactivity. At ultra-lean conditions and elevated temperatures, the
combustion regime shifts to “transitional combustion” requiring lon-
ger autoignition delay times [87]. The effect of dilution and low tem-
perature gradients not only affects the competition of different
chemical pathways usually hidden by large heat release [89], but
also affects the validity of the scheme due to the different activation
energies of some elementary reactions outside the range that the
scheme was designed for [91,92].

P2.2.3. Effects of catalysts

PCatalytic combustion of hydrocarbon fuels has been proven to be
a promising approach to oxidise ultra-lean methane mixtures by
extending the flammability limits and enhancing the kinetics associ-
ated to the oxidation process [15,16,19]. With the presence of cata-
lysts, reactions may take place over the surfaces of the catalysts at
lower temperatures. However, there are still challenges for catalytic
oxidation/combustion of ultra-lean methane mixtures. In particular,
the oxidation of methane becomes somehow more complex than
higher order hydrocarbon fuels, since higher hydrocarbons allow ini-
tiation reactions at lower temperatures [93(cid:1)95]. The catalytic con-
version process depends on both temperature and catalyst type. In
general, it undergoes the following steps: (1) oxidation takes place
at low temperature and is controlled by surface kinetics, (2) in the
intermediate temperature range, an exponential increase in conver-
sion rate takes place and is mass transfer controlled, and (3) a further
increase in temperature leads to the maximum conversion rate (at
maximum temperature) and the gas phase homogeneous reactions
contribute to the overall reaction rates.

PThere are many types of catalysts used for combustion applica-
tions, but noble metal catalysts (Pt, Pd, Rh or combinations) are usu-
ally preferred over metal(cid:1)oxide catalyst due to their enhanced
conversion properties [16,95]. There are several comprehensive
review efforts in the literature summarising the state-of-the-art in
the use of catalysts to enhance methane combustion [16,95,96], but
none of them directly address their performance on the oxidation of
ultra-lean methane mixtures. While it was found that Rd catalysts
are better suited for methane partial oxidation [96], Pd and Pt cata-
lysts are more appropriate for full oxidation because of the enhanced
conversion of CH4 to CO2 on the catalyst surface [97]. Catalytic meth-
ane combustion is still an active area of research, to the authors'
knowledge; no overall agreement is found about whether Pt or Pd
catalysts perform better for methane catalytic conversion. The
majority of the literature and data produced for those catalysts cor-
respond to mixtures above 1% CH4 [98], although Pd catalysts are
preferred for lean conditions [99]. A comparison of the performance
of such catalysts under dry and wet conditions, as well as for fresh
or steam-aged conditions can be found in the work by Abbasi et al.
[98]. The work suggested that catalyst performance is largely influ-
enced by the ambient and operating conditions, and the expected
conversion rate can be compromised during long-term steady

Poperation or wet conditions. The support material also affects the
overall conversion rate of the catalysts and a review paper on Pd-
based catalysts from experiments addressed this issue in detail
[100]. Further studies were also dedicated to examine the effect of
support materials including the temperature range and material
types [101]. Several initiatives leading to improved catalytic activi-
ties have also been addressed in the literature. It was recently found
that ceria (CeO2) could be used to increase the catalytic activity of Pd
(Pd@CeO2/H(cid:1)(cid:1)Al2O3) providing thermal stability against sintering
with outstanding catalytic performance [102]. The addition of cavi-
ties and fuel segmentation in catalytic reactors has also been investi-
gated leading to enhanced conversion rates for certain fuels under
particular conditions [103,104]. It was found that cavities could be
used for flame stabilisation and a means of providing heat source to
enhance chemical reactions. This is particularly relevant to porous
burners for ultra-lean methane oxidation/combustion. New system-
atic reaction class based approaches are now being used for noble
metals such as Pt [105,106] as catalysts, which can potentially
enhance the effective use of catalysts for ultra-lean combustion.

PMost of the contributions and knowledge obtained about the per-
formance of catalysts for combustion applications are based on
experimental studies. From theoretical/modelling points of view,
there are still many open questions about how accurate and appro-
priate the physicochemical models of catalytic combustion can be
and how the predictions can be improved for practical applications.
The modelling requires accounting for the gas phase kinetic and
transport phenomena as well as the interactions between the react-
ing gas phase in the combustor and the catalyst surface. These inter-
actions are rather complex and involve multicomponent transport
processes that are chemically and thermally dependent at the inter-
face. While the governing equations for the gas phase are already
known (consisting of conservations of mass, species and energy,
Navier(cid:1)Stokes momentum equations for chemically reactive flows,
as well as possible equations for turbulence models [45(cid:1)47], see
Eqs. (1)(cid:1)(4)), the equations governing the solid phase where the cat-
alytic conversion takes place must be described. These equations
include mass and energy balances over the catalytic surface and
should include heterogeneous chemical reactions, diffusion, as well
as convective, conductive and radiative energy transport with the
resistive heating of the catalyst and the existence of chemical source
terms on the surface [107]. Since the chemical reactions take place
on a porous media, the porosity must be taken into account since it
influences the lifetime and real performance of the catalyst. Another
important requirement for the modelling of catalytic combustion is
the surface chemistry. The gas phase chemistry involved in the oxi-
dation process of hydrocarbon fuels is better understood as dis-
cussed previously, but the elementary steps of oxidation over the
catalyst surface must also be taken into account. This is a complex
research topic and the literature devoted to this problem is scarce.
Elementary reactions in Arrhenius form have been proposed to
account for surface chemistry, but these mechanisms are largely
influenced by the catalyst type, shape, concentration, support mate-
rial, operating conditions among many other aspects, therefore devi-
ations are expected to occur when these mechanisms are used for
general applications.

PMechanisms of surface chemistry for methane oxidation can be
found in the literature. Deutschmann et al. [107] proposed a reaction
scheme for the oxidation of methane, hydrogen and oxygen over
polycrystalline platinum. It consists of 23 elementary reactions with
temperature independent pre-exponential factors. For palladium
catalysts, a correction of 13 steps can also be used. The schemes
were compared against experimental data using simplified configu-
rations and properties as well as two-dimensional calculations. The
results indicated a certain level of correlation with the experiments
and encouraged developing more sophisticated models. Chemical
schemes for partial oxidation on Rd [108] and Ni have been

Pdeveloped [109]. A full set of a surface reaction scheme for C1(cid:1)(cid:1)C3
alkanes on Rd was proposed by Schwiedernoch et al. [110] and then
corrected with additional C2(cid:1)(cid:1)C3 species [111]. Most of these
schemes were designed for partial oxidation and particular catalyst
type, therefore their use for ultra-lean methane combustion applica-
tions on possibly different combustor designs suggests a low appli-
cability and the need to develop new surface chemical schemes
capable of representing to a larger extent the combustion process
over the catalyst surface.

P2.2.4. Reduced chemical kinetics for ultra-lean methane oxidation

PThe oxidation process of highly diluted methane becomes com-
plex not only from the chemical point of view, but also from the
practical point of view when it comes to modelling the combustion
process in practical burners. While general reduced schemes were
developed for methane combustion under conventional operation
conditions, much less has been done for ultra-lean conditions. This
sub-section presents an overview of simplified and reduced chemi-
cal schemes specially developed to model the oxidation process of
ultra-lean methane mixtures. Technological solutions will be dis-
cussed in Section 3.

PAs not many reduced chemical schemes have been fully validated
at ultra-lean conditions, this topic still remains open and requires
further research. It is arguable that developing reduced schemes for
ultra-lean CH4 oxidation/combustion is somewhat premature, con-
sidering that chemical kinetics needs to be better understood. How-
ever, some preliminary efforts have already been devoted to this.
Recent work [17,91(cid:1)93] has shown that simplifications of the mech-
anisms for ultra-lean methane oxidation can be developed by the
constraint of considering the species that are measured experimen-
tally in the combustion products. As the species in the final state of
the combustion process correspond to CO, CO2 and H2O (even H2 is
not present), the mechanisms can be expressed in terms of those
species only. In these studies, the authors gave more importance to
the environment of the oxidation process such as characteristics of
the reactors, materials, temperatures and type of monoliths than the
chemical kinetics in multi-stage reaction kinetics. Gosiewski et al.
[92] proposed three main reaction pathways for the homogenous
combustion of methane under ultra-lean conditions: parallel, conse-
cutive and parallel(cid:1)consecutive, which are represented in Fig. 2. The
chemical pathways are represented in Arrhenius form without
including oxygen due to the large excess of O2 present in the lean
mixtures.

PIt was shown [92] that for certain temperature levels, the com-
bustion of ultra-lean methane mixtures can be represented by a con-
secutive or parallel(cid:1)consecutive reaction path, since CO2 is only
formed from CO at high temperatures. Kinetic reactions are deter-
mined for a free space, and type of monolith reactors using two-
stage and three-stage mechanisms. These results were consistent

chain termination reactions were investigated as functions of the
reactor ceramic surface. In this work, two sets of reactions were pro-
posed depending on temperature. For the low temperature range,
the following two-step mechanism is proposed:

PThe work by Wang et al. [17] departed from the reaction
pathways of Gosiewski et al. [92], where verification with ther-
mal and catalytic reverse flow reactors was performed providing
new reaction rates. This work also addressed effects of the
ceramic beds on the ignition temperature and the stability of the
combustion process. It was stated that the two-step consecutive
mechanism could be considered to describe the combustion in a
free reactor and with monolith under conditions of practical
interest for the oxidation of ultra-lean methane mixtures. Abbasi
et al. [98] also proposed reduced schemes for Pt and Pt(cid:1)(cid:1)Pd cata-
lysts including inhibition effect of water. Pt catalysts were mod-
elled using an empirical power-law expression with orders one
and zero for methane and water respectively. Stem-aged effects
on Pt catalysts were found to be rather small and only small cor-
rections on the pre-exponential
factor and activation energy
were required. The reaction kinetics for Pt(cid:1)(cid:1)Pd required a more
complex expression due to the sensitivity of the catalyst to
water, so a Langmuir(cid:1)Hinshelwood(cid:1)Hougen(cid:1)Watson type of
rate equation was proposed.

PCatalysts have been proven to be effective in extending the flam-
mability limit for ultra-lean CH4 oxidation/combustion. The presence
of catalysts can change the chemical pathways. Fig. 3 shows an over-
all chemical mechanism for methane catalytic oxidation [16]. Rela-
tively simple mechanisms like this are obviously advantageous in
numerical simulations of combustion in large-scale industrial appli-
cations due to reduced computational costs associated with the sim-
plified chemistry. However,
the validity of such mechanisms
depends on the relevant conditions including the detailed chemical
pathways and the thermodynamic parameters of the reactions con-
sidered in the mechanism development.

2.3. Development of chemical kinetic schemes

PDevelopment of the chemical kinetic scheme is an essential ele-
ment for the modelling and simulation of ultra-lean methane oxida-
tion/combustion. In chemical kinetics, the chemical pathways and
the reaction rates dictate whether a specific reaction will take place
or not, a new species will be observed or not, and how fast a species

Pwill be generated or destroyed for the given conditions. Chemical
pathways and reaction rates are not only influenced by local compo-
sitions, but also by environmental conditions such as pressure, tem-
perature and heterogeneities. The presence of a plasma source or a
catalyst also affects the chemical kinetics. Reaction rates strongly
depend on concentrations of the reactants in most chemical reac-
tions for combustion applications, which are also influenced by
third-body reactions. Chemical schemes are currently developed for
rich and lean conditions within the flammability limits of the mix-
tures, but are not adequately developed to describe the chemistry
for unconventional conditions such as combustion under ultra-lean
conditions. In this case, the chemical pathways might be different
and new adjustments on the reaction rates will be required to
account for the low concentration of the fuel. For industrial applica-
tions, the use of detailed schemes in advanced numerical simula-
tions can become prohibitive when finite-rate chemistry approaches
are used. Even with the massive increase in supercomputing power
in the last decades, solving hundreds of species and reactions in CFD
simulations such as LES of turbulent flames is still a challenge.
Therefore, the development of skeletal and low-order reduced
chemical schemes is essential to apply these simulations to practical
systems operating with ultra-lean mixtures. However, understand-
ings on detailed chemical pathways and reaction rates are the pre-
requisites for the development of
In the
following, development of chemical kinetic schemes for ultra-lean
methane oxidation/combustion are briefly discussed.

these mechanisms.

PChemical kinetic schemes usually include information on chemi-
cal pathways or channels and reaction rates. For reaction rates, the
influencing factors include the nature of the reactants and products,
concentration of reacting species, temperature, as well as external
agents such as catalysts. For ultra-lean methane oxidation, the indi-
vidual steps in the mechanism are important as the mixture may not
be able to ignite and the oxidation may not be sustainable. In chemi-
cal kinetics, the stoichiometric equation is the net results of any
number of intermediate steps, where key information on the indi-
vidual steps in the mechanism might have been lost. At ultra-lean
conditions, an overall stoichiometric equation is unable to reveal the
key stages in the reaction when the ignition and flame propagation
with combustion instability are investigated. Fundamental studies
are needed to understand the chemical kinetics for this extreme con-
dition.

PAlthough the chemistry of CH4 oxidation/combustion is relatively
well known at rich conditions, little is known about it at extremely
diluted conditions. So far there is not a well-established detailed
mechanism available for ultra-lean mixtures under ambient pres-
sure conditions, nor skeletal/reduced mechanisms. Therefore there
is a need to develop these schemes. The determination of parameters
corresponding to the chemical reality is a complex task. Tradition-
ally, it has been achieved in three different ways [112].

P1) By designing experiments isolating some reactions in such a way
that the model variables corresponding to the measurements
can be expressed analytically as a function of parameters of

Pinterest. The optimal values can then be identified mathemati-
cally through a least-squares regression. For the understanding
of chemical kinetics at ultra-lean conditions, well-designed
experiments will be indispensable.

P2) By using methods from theoretical chemistry such as density
functional theory calculations coupled with transition state the-
ory (TST). Depending on the involved assumptions and simplifi-
cations, some methods, especially semi-empirical techniques,
can lead to great uncertainties with respect to the evaluated
parameters.

An unknown uncertainty is also introduced by this approach.

PThe elaboration of an accurate predictive reaction mechanism
must surmount two major challenges: the detailed reaction mecha-
nisms composed of numerous elementary reactions and the estima-
these
tion of
elementary reactions. One fundamental approach to examine chemi-
cal kinetic mechanisms is to obtain insights from quantum mechan-
ics, to explain the behaviour of matter and its interactions with
energy on the scale of atoms and subatomic particles. In recent
years, ab initio quantum chemical computations have been used in
understanding the chemical kinetics of combustion [113]. In princi-
ple, quantum mechanical methods combined with chemical kinetic
theory can provide accurate information on transition states and
reaction rate constants for individual elementary reaction. However,
these computational methods can be prohibitively expensive in pro-
viding detailed dynamical descriptions of complex oxidation reac-
tions taking into account the effects of temperature and pressure on
the reaction paths. For the foreseeable future, quantum chemistry is
only expected to play a limited supporting role in the development
of chemical kinetic schemes for very simple cases.

PMolecular dynamics (MD) methods numerically simulate the
physical movements of atoms and molecules, which are allowed to
interact for a fixed period of time. In a MD simulation, the trajecto-
ries of atoms and molecules are usually determined by numerically
solving Newton's equations of motion for a system of interacting
particles. Forces between the particles and their potential energies
are calculated using interatomic potentials or molecular mechanics
force fields, so the results will give a view of the dynamical evolution
of the system. However, conventional MD methods using the force
fields with rigid connectivity cannot describe bond breaking, bond
formation and chemical reactivity [114]. In order to overcome the
deficiencies of conventional MD simulations and to retain nearly the
accuracy of quantum mechanical calculations, reactive force field
[115] was developed, but the application has been limited. Recently,
a methodology for deducing quantitative reaction models from reac-
tive molecular dynamics simulations by identifying, quantifying,
and evaluating elementary reactions of classical trajectories was
proposed [116]. In addition, a simple protocol allowing fully auto-
mated discovery of elementary chemical reaction steps was devel-
oped and applied to several single-molecule systems of combustion
[117]. Nevertheless, the predictive tools need significant develop-
ments before they can be used for practical combustion applications
since they currently cannot be easily used to predict reaction path-
ways and thermodynamic properties of multiple reaction steps
under practical conditions including premixed combustion of meth-
ane at ultra-lean conditions.

PAlthough improvements on theoretical kinetics and quantum
chemistry have made fundamental theory an indispensable partner
in reaction kinetics [113], chemical kinetic schemes cannot be pre-
dicted at the fundamental level without empiricisms and simplifica-
tions at

Pand MD simulations may provide a useful tool in understanding the
fundamentals of kinetics under highly diluted condition. However,
the currently available theoretical/computational tools are not
entirely deterministic and the computations can be far too expensive
for the developments of chemical kinetic schemes. For the develop-
ment of chemical kinetic schemes for ultra-lean CH4 mixtures, con-
certed efforts from both experimentalists and modellers are called
for.

PInevitably, uncertainties exist in developing chemical kinetic
schemes for combustion applications due to the empiricisms and
limitations/assumptions embedded in the available tools. To analyse
the uncertainties in these schemes, uncertainty quantification (UQ),
which tries to determine how likely certain outcomes are if some
aspects of the system are not exactly known, is becoming increas-
ingly important. The uncertainty quantification, propagation and
minimisation for the combustion kinetic models were recently sys-
tematically reviewed by Wang and Sheen [118], which detailed the
sources of uncertainties and provided a classification for them. The
application of UQ in highly complex, multi-parameter combustion
chemistry problems has to be considered and treated as an integral
part of the combustion chemistry development. When UQ is applied
to combustion chemical kinetics, the main methods related to model
and parameter evaluation employ probability-based approaches
[112]. The standard sensitivity analysis for chemical kinetic schemes
can be regarded as a consideration of UQ, which can aid the develop-
ment of predictive kinetic models in different ways when treated as
a Bayesian inference problem [118]. UQ is playing an increasingly
important role in the development of chemical kinetic schemes,
which is also essential for the development of the much needed
chemical kinetic schemes for ultra-lean CH4 oxidation/combustion.

PDevelopment of chemical kinetic schemes for ultra-lean CH4 oxi-
dation/combustion can be achieved through a combination of funda-
mental studies of reaction rates through well-defined and purposely
designed experiments, ab initio theoretical calculations, and of anal-
yses of global experimental measurements. These studies also need
to be supplemented by UQ analyses, so that a measurable progress
can be made over time. Catalytic oxidation is certainly a promising
direction, where chemical mechanism for methane catalytic oxida-
tion/combustion was developed [119] as shown in Fig. 3. However,
further investigations are needed not only to assess the existing
mechanisms, but also to develop schemes for new operating condi-
tions such as different catalysts and different pressure and tempera-
ture conditions.

PIn computational modelling and numerical simulation of turbu-
lent combustion, the chemical kinetic schemes are coupled with tur-
bulent combustion modelling. Chemistry based on tabulation, e.g.
Refs. [42, 120, 121], can provide significant reduction in computa-
tional costs. Recently, a turbulent combustion model was proposed
[121] that extended a tabulated chemistry model to account for
product gas dilution and heat-loss effects by introducing simplified
assumptions to reduce the model complexity. The turbulent closure
model developed was based on a presumed PDF method to account
for turbulence-chemistry coupling. The approach extended the
flamelet/progress variable formulation by including information
about the intensity of internal dilution rates and heat losses. In LES
of ultra-lean combustion, the modelling ability in dealing with
extinction and re-ignition is of great significance when one chooses
the SGS models. In this regard, models such as the linear-eddy model
(LEM), or the so-called one-dimensional turbulence (ODT) model
[122], may be advantageous. Due to their formulations, the LEM or
ODT type of SGS model has particular strengths in dealing with
extinction and re-ignition problems, e.g. Refs. [123(cid:1)126]. In this
modelling concept, explicit distinction exists between molecular dif-
fusion, turbulent advection (stirring), and chemical reaction, while
all spatial and temporal scales are resolved down to the smallest
turbulence scales for the transport of chemical species and the

Pone-dimensional formulation makes small-scale resolution compu-
tationally affordable. Modelling/simulation of ultra-lean CH4 com-
bustion can benefit from developments in turbulent combustion
modelling of other related applications, while the development of
chemical kinetic schemes for ultra-lean conditions represents a
unique challenge.

3. Technological challenges and perspectives

PThe technological challenges of combustion mitigation of ultra-
lean CH4 are significant, mainly because understanding on many of
the scientific issues requires improvement. For example, plasma-
assisted combustion is a promising technology to enhance low tem-
perature fuel oxidation and processing, increase lean-burn flame sta-
bility and reduce emissions, but the area needs further investigation.
Technical development of effective plasma discharges is still needed
for operations in conventional combustion systems [25,26]. For
ultra-lean methane mitigation, tailor-made experimentations are
essential to the development of the technology. To achieve effective
combustion mitigation of ultra-lean CH4, there are a number of
important aspects. Firstly, the combustion of ultra-lean methane is
highly sensitive to variations in concentration due to the previously
described reaction sustainability issues; therefore, a combustion
mitigation system has to be flexible in dealing with CH4 concentra-
tion variations, as the CH4 concentration often changes from case to
case and also changes with the operating conditions for the same
case [15]. A robust system must also be resistant to fuel variability.
Secondly, contamination in the fuel stream can be important to the
ignition and subsequent oxidation/combustion, where particulate
matter and trace gases may have a detrimental effect on the cata-
lysts or may even quench the process. Furthermore, the technology
has to be cost-effective as a means of GHG mitigation with a view
towards energy utilisation.

PAmong the possible technologies for combustion mitigation, a
prominent common feature is recuperative combustion, where sys-
tem heat and mass (often in the form of exhaust gas) are recirculated
to improve the initial temperature for chemical reactions. The con-
cept of recuperative combustion is not new, which is similar to the
term “excess enthalpy combustion (EEC)” [127,128], but the technol-
ogy very much depends on the specific application involving optimi-
sation for it to be effective. The starting point for the design of a
system using recuperative combustion or EEC is simply heat and
mass balance equations. For practical applications, design optimisa-
tion is essential but it can be challenging as there are many interact-
ing thermodynamic and chemical parameters involved. Flow and
combustion control is the key to optimise ignition and sustain oxida-
tion/combustion. Ideally the heat flow needs to be controlled as
a function of the methane concentration. For low methane concen-
trations more heat is required to raise the temperature to the
sustainable oxidation/combustion regime and as the methane con-
centration increases less heat is required because a lower tempera-
ture is needed for ignition and to maintain a sustainable reaction. In
addition, combination of plasma ignition or catalysts with recupera-
tive combustion may provide the best possible solution. However,
there is currently a lack of study on these important technical issues.
PCurrently technologies that can be used for ultra-lean methane
mitigation and utilization are not well established in general because
of a wide range of technological issues. For ultra-lean methane oxi-
dation/combustion, there has not been a full understanding on key
aspects of reaction behaviour including ignition delay times and oxi-
dation times as functions of working conditions such as concentra-
tion, temperature, pressure ranges of the mixture. This section
discusses the technical aspects of ultra-lean CH4 mitigation, where
the focus is on one specific application only (cid:1) VAM mitigation.
Underground coal mining is a significant source of fugitive methane
emissions, and most of coal mining related methane is emitted to

Pthe atmosphere through mine ventilation as VAM [129]. There is a
certain uniqueness to mining operations that obviates the necessity
of a technology with the flexibility of design to meet the require-
ments of a given mining project. Although the technology is only dis-
cussed for VAM in this section, some of the technical issues can be of
general nature. Mitigation of CH4 from gas and oil explorations may
benefit from the technology for VAM mitigation. As the subject was
reviewed by Su et al. [15] more than a decade ago, this section is
mainly focussed on the recent development of the technology
including some applications. In the following, VAM mitigation tech-
nical obstacles are discussed first, followed by overviews of primary
fuel systems for VAM mitigation and ancillary use of low concentra-
tion methane.

3.1. VAM mitigation technical obstacles

PVAM is a particularly intractable technological problem due to
the low concentration of methane contained, infrequently near 2%,
but typically 0.1(cid:1)1%, within a high flow rate of ventilation air typi-
cally 100(cid:1)300 m3/s [129,130]. The variability of the methane con-
centration contained within the ventilation air flow presents
operational and engineering challenges. Not only does the concen-
tration vary due to operational changes such as conditions at the
surface or variations in the methane concentration of the coal, but
also is affected by the pressure at depth, the variations in atmo-
spheric pressure and the presence of various other trace gases and
particulate matters.

PThe methane contained in coal increases with both the depth and
age of the coal seam [131]. The in-situ pressure increases with depth
which reduces the permeability while increasing the pore pressure.
Under these conditions the methane is tightly bound to the coal and
surrounding rock strata. Underground mining emits greater levels of
methane than surface mining and deeper mines release more meth-
ane as the coal is crushed, consequently underground mines account
for nearly 90% of methane emissions from the coal sector. As the
depth increases, the air pressure at depth and the air density also
increase with a corresponding increase of the pore pressure exerted
on the coal surfaces exposed; however, this depth effect leads to an
increase in the ability of the coal to contain methane, which results
in higher concentrations of methane released as the depth of the
mine increases.

PParticulate matters and trace gases pose a potential issue in com-
bustion or oxidation based mitigation systems due to the possibility
of contamination of catalysts or quenching of the process [129,130].
Depending on the concentrations, which are subject to variations,
the chemical constituents of the flow can have a deleterious effect
on the equipment or components. A recent study of the constituents
of mine ventilation air was undertaken to provide an understanding
of the potential effects on combustion based or catalytic oxidation
systems. Using optical and scanning electron microscopy, energy
dispersive X-ray analysis and micro gas chromatography to deter-
mine the particle morphology, mineral content and gas concentra-
tions respectively, it was found that at an Australian mine with a
methane concentration of about 1%, the CO2, H2S and SO2 were all
less than 1 ppm and the particulate matter ranged from 0.13 mg/m3
to 4.47 mg/m3 depending on the production activity in the mine
[129]. Putting these values in the context of a typical flow rate of
300 m3/s to provide an engineering perspective, the range of particu-
late mass flow is 140(cid:1)4800 g/hr. Considering the variability of par-
ticulate matter loading and that the particle size is in the 1(cid:1)5 mm
(which are very small and fall in the respirable particle range), as the
particle size gets smaller the more difficult and expensive the filtra-
tion process becomes. Particulates of this size and the large flow
rates present operational difficulties for processes that involve sensi-
tive or exotic materials such as those used in catalytic, adsorptive
and absorptive processes.

PThe low concentration of VAM leads to major difficulties in its
mitigation. An effective mitigation strategy would be increasing its
concentration. Concentrating the methane can be accomplished by
membrane separation, absorption or adsorption. The engineering
applications of membrane separation concepts have been consid-
ered as early as 1980 [132] when continuous membrane columns
were studied as a means of methane enrichment. Membranes or
nano-membranes are not currently viable as a means of separating
a low methane concentration from the ventilation flows. Future
development may provide commercially viable membrane separa-
tion systems, but presently the high costs of initial capital invest-
ment and membrane maintenance or replacement due to fouling
are prohibitive.

PPressure swing adsorption (PSA) is a technology used to separate
some gas species from a mixture of gases under pressure according
to the molecular characteristics of the species and affinity for an
adsorbent material. Since there are different affinities of gases for
dissimilar surfaces, it is possible to separate a combination of gases
by using different materials [24]. PSA is more effective for higher
concentration methane flows such as mine methane gas, which can
typically be 50(cid:1)60% methane. A study of PSA showed that a 55.2 vol
% methane concentration was enriched to 96(cid:1)98 vol% methane
[133]. Although the methane recovery efficiency reached 86(cid:1)91%,
the process is not yet available for low concentration high volumet-
ric flow situations such as VAM. PSA may ultimately be less expen-
sive than membrane technology; thus, a more attractive solution in
future. The operational principles of adsorption require a flow of gas
through vessels, which is difficult to accomplish at large diameters,
but long reactors produce a significant pressure drop [15]. A petro-
leum pitch based honeycomb monolithic carbon fibre composite
adsorbent [134] demonstrated a methane adsorption capacity,
which corresponds to a micro-pore width of 2.14 nm, the optimum
pore width generally considered to be ideal for methane adsorption
[135].

PCombustion based mitigation systems generally follow design
imperatives that are balanced in terms of the fuel(cid:1)air ratios and the
inlets are filtered to prevent extraneous particulates from entering
the combustion chamber. Variations in fuel concentrations, particu-
late matter or various peripheral gaseous additions are not well tol-
erated in delicate systems, but do not present significant difficulties
to large and rugged systems such as large diesel engines, power
plants or rotary kilns.

PPresently the availability of technology, combustion based or oth-
erwise, to mitigate methane at the very low, but ubiquitous levels
below 0.5%, without the use of an additional fuel is non-existent;
thus, a forward focus on such technology would be of great benefit
to the industry and provide a significant impact on the GHG emis-
sions on a global scale [136]. There are two classes of combustion
based systems in operation at present where the VAM is either used
as a primary or secondary fuel. Other methods of methane mitiga-
tion that are not combustion based include biological action, concen-
tration techniques and nano-membrane technology.

PWhen VAM is the primary fuel in systems such as lean-burn or
recuperative gas turbines, thermal or catalytic flow reversal reactors
and regenerative thermal oxidation, the VAM is the only required
fuel except in cases where the systems require start-up energy or
the methane concentration falls below the design specifications
[7,136]. When VAM is used as a secondary fuel a portion of the
designed intake air is replaced with the air containing the VAM. The
fuel value of the additional flow containing methane allows for a
reduction of the fuel that would normally be injected, according to
the design specifications of the device. This approach is employed
more often in internal combustion engines due to the flexibility
available with regard to locating the engines within proximity to the
source of VAM. In the case of other systems, there are drawbacks
such as the delicate operational aspects of the gas turbine or

Pproximity issues with rotary kilns or coal fired power stations. There
are often sources of methane at a much higher concentration such as
drained sources. These are typically high concentration low volume
sources and can be used to supplement the VAM flow to a higher
methane concentration, making it easier to be used, such as being
flared or sold to market if the quality of the gas is sufficient [7,15].

POne important issue for technological developments is the cost-
ing, which decides whether the technology can be commercially
deployed. It was stated that the implementation of the methane mit-
igation plants is not economic without a carbon credit [15], where
the major capital costs of established technologies including TFFR,
CFFR and CMR were summarised. The recent developments have not
led to significant drops in the costs as some of the technical elements
such as the use of catalysts remain expensive. For the porous burner
technology, there is still a lack of preliminary economic analysis.
Costing is also an issue for many other mitigation/utilisation tech-
nologies. For example, concentrators to enrich methane levels to
meet the requirements of a specific technology can be very useful if
the costs can be further reduced.

3.2. Primary fuel systems for VAM mitigation

PPrincipal uses of VAM involve combustion of the methane in ven-
tilation air as a primary fuel. It should be noted that the definition of
“primary fuel” is not exact for some technologies depending on the
CH4 concentration in air and the minimum CH4 concentration for
the operational requirement, particularly where a lot of supplemen-
tary high quality fuel is required when recovering energy to generate
power. The operational mechanism of the technology can be ther-
mal, catalytic and concentrating [15]. In practical applications, the
system often employs the flow reversal principle to transfer meth-
ane's heat of combustion, first to a solid medium, and then back to
incoming air to raise its temperature to the ignition temperature of
CH4. The use of a catalyst can distinguish a specific technology with
others. In the last decade, there have been a number of practical sys-
tems designed to burn VAM as a primary fuel. As the industrial
designs always have commercial implications, not all the details are
available. Therefore we only present some technical overviews of
selected systems. Some examples on these practical systems will be
mentioned.

PThe VAM RAB project

(http://www.corkys.net.au/vam-rab/;
accessed on 5 May 2016) in Australia exploits the principles of ther-
mal oxidation. In 2011 some experimental work using a 1/40 pilot-
scale system was performed to verify the safety aspects of the sys-
tem at Centennial Coal's Bloomfield operations. The scale of this
demonstration project is a 1 m3/s flow rate with a design parameter
to oxidise methane concentrations in the range of 0.35(cid:1)1.1%. The
safety tests allowed the methane concentration in the 5(cid:1)12% range,
tosimulate extreme conditions with a successful outcome. The VAM
RAB is currently in the pre-commercial phase, but the scale-up
designs are being prepared and discussions pertaining to a full-scale
plant are ongoing. The principle of operation exploits a regenerative
heat exchange between a gas flow and a stationary solid, with pore
flow characteristics in the reaction zone. There are a few steps in the
operation of the TFRR, the first is that the ventilation air enters one
side, deposits combustion energy in the bed and exits the other side.
At start up or at low fuel concentrations there is a need for additional
fuel or heat, as the heat builds up the reaction becomes stable,
requiring no additional fuel or heat. The heat in the bed will follow
the flow; therefore, moves towards the exit of the reactor. This effect
is countered by reversing the flow at the appropriate time to keep
the heat contained within the bed. One complete cycle is comprised
of one flow reversal in each direction; thus, the flow is proceeding in
the original direction after one cycle. Computer models are available
to determine the optimal time of flow reversal, a time interval deter-
mined by the temperature profile, which are primarily used to

Pdesign the systems for specific sites [19]. Since the flow direction
reverses by the operation of valves, which are the main moving parts
of the system, the system is a robust piece of equipment requiring
minimal maintenance over the lifetime of operation.

PIn the United Kingdom, MEGTEC initially developed systems for
the mitigation of volatile organic compounds. The MEGTEC VOCSIDI-
ZERTM technology (http://www.megtec.com/documents/UK_Vocsid
izer.pdf; accessed on 5 May 2016) is a regenerative thermal oxidiser
and can supply a superheated steam or produce electricity using an
ordinary steam turbine. The first testing of the VOCSIDIZERTM using
methane was at the Thoresby Mine in 1994 in the UK. The positive
results of that pilot plant verified the VOCSIDIZERTM's capability,
which underwent a continuous methane oxidation reaction with a
low susceptibility to the variations typical of methane in ventilation
air. The first commercial installation of the VOCSIDIZERTM was at the
Appin Colliery in Australia in 2001(cid:1)2002, where heat recovery was
demonstrated by the generation of steam for 12 months. In 2007 the
Westvamp project began operation at 70 m3/s using CH4 concentra-
tion maintained at 0.9% to produce power by driving steam through
a 6 MWe turbine. The supplementation of the incoming ventilation
air is possible by the addition of coal mine methane (CMM), the
higher concentration methane taken from the mine by draining the
coal seam. Although this is a convenient use of the CMM, this prod-
uct is not always available and not necessarily inexpensive to
acquire, which may lead to the need for an external fuel source
should the system design be dependent on the CMM and supply is
either exhausted or drainage is no longer required. The confidence
generated by the trials has instigated the installation of a turnkey
system for the Zhengzhou Coal Mining Group, Henan Province in
China, which provides hot water from methane concentrations of
0.3(cid:1)0.7% at a flow rate 18 m3/s. MEGTEC now has over 800 VOCSIDI-
ZERTM systems globally with many of them operating on methane.
The regenerative thermal oxidiser is a proven technology for using
VAM as a primary fuel with the capacity to produce various thermal
products such as electricity or hot water, the efficiency of the system
relies on the principles of flameless oxidation and a recirculation of
heat from the combustion zone to pre-heat the incoming process air
to oxidation temperatures.

PA project underway at the Dafosi coal mine in China (https://cdm.
unfccc.int/Projects/DB/TUEV-SUED1236267273.45/view;
accessed
on 5 May 2016) has demonstrated the use of both CMM and VAM
combined together improved the operational stability by maintain-
ing the methane concentration of the incoming fuel at 0.25% or
greater. A preheating stage of 36 hrs is needed for the TFRR to
become stably operating without any further fuel or heat additions.
Electricity generation, by production of steam to drive a steam tur-
bine, was possible only for the methane concentrations above 0.6%
and the thermal efficiency varied from 31.61% to 46.82%. The current
power plant began operating in August 2012, at a capacity 83.3 m3/s
(maintained at 0.9%(cid:1)1.1% CH4) to produce 1.2 MPa at 280 °C, which
provides 4.5 MWe.

PThere are technologies based on using catalysts. The VAMCAT
developed at Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research
Organization (CSIRO) is a lean-burn catalytic gas turbine (http://
www.csiro.au/en/Research/EF/Areas/Coal-mining/Mining-safety-
and-automation/VAMCAT; accessed on 5 May 2016), which can
operate at a methane concentration as low as 0.8%, but is designed
for operation at 1% methane. The VAMCAT is composed of a com-
pressor, a catalytic combustor, a turbine and a recuperator. The ther-
mal efficiency of a generic gas turbine system can be improved
significantly if exhaust gas heat is recovered. The exhaust heat may
be used for preheating the compressed air containing methane to
improve the energy conversion efficiency. The VAMCAT uses a palla-
dium catalyst supported on g-alumina substrate, which has a maxi-
mum continuous service temperature of 850 °C [137]. The catalytic
combustion gas turbine system oxidises methane while generating

P25 kWe electricity [138]. A power generator demonstration for the
Huainan Coal Mining Group, China was undertaken in 2011. At the
fuel concentration of 0.8%, the production of 25 kWe of electrical
power would require a gas flow of 0.25(cid:1)0.3 m3/s; thus, for a VAM
flow of 300 m3/s about 1200 VAMCATTM units would be required to
accommodate a single typical ventilation shaft. Although the cata-
lytic technology for a gas turbine allows for lean fuel air mixtures it
would not be cost-effective or practical to consider the use of such a
large number of units to accommodate the flow from a typical mine;
therefore, this technology is considered as conceptual and pre-com-
mercial. A 1 MW design was reported to be in progress [138], but
has not yet been completed. Should a 1 MW unit become available
the supply air flow rate required would be much higher, which
would reduce the number of units required to a more manageable
number.

PThere is a catalytic combustion gas turbine system that operates
on VAM supplemented by CMM, to produce a methane concentra-
tion approximately 2% [139]. The system is composed of an electrical
generator that uses the VAM, supplemented by CMM as fuel, and a
VAM oxidation unit. The electrical generator is a regenerative gas
turbine with a catalytic combustor, duct burner and power con-
verter. The VAM is compressed and heated to about 430 °C in the
recuperator, which increases the temperature sufficiently for oxida-
tion by the catalyst combustor. In the VAM oxidation unit, VAM is
heated to 280 °C by taking heat from gas turbine exhaust, which is
then mixed into the gas turbine exhaust gas and conveyed to a cata-
lyst layer for conversion to carbon dioxide. The catalytic combustion
gas turbine generates 1 MWe for a 0.5% methane concentration VAM
consumption of 6.4 m3/s. There are 1.2 MW of energy available for a
0.5% methane concentration, using 55 MJ/kg and a flow of 6.4 m3/s,
but since the VAM is supplemented up to 2% the energy available is
4.8 MW so the electrical power generation efficiency is about 20%.

PCatalytic thermal reverse reactors operate on similar principles
as the TFRR but the addition of catalysts reduces the temperature at
which oxidation occurs. There are many catalysts available; a partial
list of common catalysts is Pd/Al2O3, Sr0.8La0.2MnAl11O19, Pt/
Al2O3, Co3O4, La0.5Sr0.5CoO3, Cu/La/Al2O3, and LaCoO3 which are
characterised by their methane oxidation rate at atmospheric pres-
sure for a given methane concentration at a given temperature. Note
the expensive and exotic nature of the catalysts such as palladium,
platinum or rare earth elements like lanthanum coupled with a high
surface area oxide. The problem is that as the concentration of meth-
ane in ventilation air increases the heat generated also increases and
for methane concentrations exceeding 1% even heat removal may be
insufficient to protect the catalyst from degradation or destruction.
Manganese is one of the least expensive catalyst metals, but the
temperature of the catalyst bed can surpass 900 °C for methane con-
centrations over 0.8%, which is sufficiently high to cause the catalyst
to undergo rapid destruction. Resorting to an expensive palladium
catalyst to keep the temperature lower by about 100 °C also results
in lower heat recovery and the cost of the palladium catalyst leads
to a payback period of almost 7 years for an industrial plant [140].
The CH4MIN employs a catalytic thermal oxidation process (https://
www.globalmethane.org/documents/events_coal_120904_megtec.
pdf; accessed on 5 May 2016), developed by CANMET, a Canadian
government energy research organisation that is part of Natural
Resources Canada. It provides a great potential for the use of VAM as
a principal fuel source because the technology is able to oxidise
diluted methane in coal mine ventilation air and produce useable
energy from heat exchangers operating at an optimal temperature.

PSimilar to TFRR, the CFRR technology requires a minimum meth-
ane concentration to maintain the reaction, which is more expensive
from the point of initial capital expenditure and the potential need
for replacement of the catalysts, either due to wear or fouling. There
are three basic types of CFRR fluidised bed, packed bed and honey-
comb monolith. The packed bed is composed of ceramic beads

Pcoated with a catalyst; thus, only differs from packed bed TFRR by
the addition of the catalyst, the introduction of a significant pressure
drop is a drawback as an additional fan must be used to supply the
energy to move the air through the reactor [7]. This extra electricity
is in addition to supplemental fuel needed should the methane con-
centration fall below 0.4(cid:1)0.45% or the temperature falls below the
reduced autoignition temperature, typically 400(cid:1)450 °C; thus, an
extra expense and reduced efficiency compared to a TFRR. The flui-
dised bed introduced somewhat less of a pressure drop, but the flow
must be high enough to entrain the beads in the flow in order to
maintain the fluidisation. Monolith catalytic reactors are the most
promising due to the strength inherent in the structure and the sub-
stantially reduced pressure drop [16]. It has been argued that a cut-
off of 0.4% is the decision point that determines when a TFRR or
CFRR is selected as the appropriate system [141]. Since the CFRR
requires a methane concentration of at least 0.4% to maintain an
auto-thermal reaction and the catalysts are prone to degradation or
destruction at methane concentrations above 0.8% the TFRR is the
reverse flow reactor of choice for both the high and low methane
concentration extremes. Both the CFRR and TFRR are capable in the
intermediate range, where other factors such as heat exchanger
design, character of the ventilation flow in terms of contaminants
and the desired operational temperatures become the influencing
parameters.

PAlthough there are a variety of industrial designs which can
be quite different, the technological challenge of VAM mitigation
remains the same (cid:1) exploring the thermodynamic/aerodynamic
limits, including minimising heat losses from the system, maxi-
mising fuel(cid:1)air mixing for oxidation, and optimising the initial
energy level to initiate the oxidation, so that the ultra-lean mix-
tures can be ignited, and once ignited, the oxidation/combustion
will be sustainable.

3.3. Ancillary use of low concentration methane

PDue to the low methane concentration, VAM can be used as part
of the supply air for almost any combustion process. This is the ancil-
lary use of low concentration methane. As mature technologies for
energy conversion, both internal combustion engines and gas tur-
bines can be used for this application. Internal combustion engines
only require a medium quality gas, so they are an appropriate choice
for using ambient air containing VAM to support the combustion
processes. Diesel engines are routinely used to provide electricity to
mines in remote locations and mining companies are well informed
as to the capital costs and operating costs of these power plants,
which can also be used to reduce the VAM emissions provided the
installation is designed to avoid costs associated with transportation
of the VAM [7]. The Appin Colliery in Australia is a significant and
illustrative project, where 54 internal combustion engines power an
electricity generation project in New South Wales and an additional
40 at the Tower location provide a total of 97 MWe from 94 Caterpil-
lar 3516LE generators. The VAM and all the drained gas from the
mine are used as supplemental fuel, which contributes from 4(cid:1)10%
of the required engine fuel while using about 20% of the ventilation
discharged from the mine [15]. The total output is 654 GWe each
year.

PA gas turbine can be situated within reasonable proximity of the
exhaust evas(cid:2)e of the ventilation system fan enabling ventilation air
to be drawn by the intake of the turbine to use the VAM as combus-
tion air. Large gas turbines are required as a large supply of air has to
be dealt with when attempting to use the mine ventilation as an air
supply with a supplemental fuel. A typical simple gas turbine cycle
requires about 0.003 m3/s kW, so a 10 MW turbine would need about
30 m3/s and the test case that employed a 2.5 MW Solar Centaur tur-
bine, modified to accept an inlet air flow with 1.6% methane content
would require about 7.5 m3/s. As a test case the trials were

Psuspended because of technical challenges pertaining to the opera-
tion of the gas turbine operation, the gas turbine suffered a failure to
start suspected to be on account of the variations in composition of
the inlet air. The failure of the trials is an indication of the difficulties
involved with using sensitive equipment in conjunction with mine
ventilation air and the requirement that typically 300 m3/s would
need to be used suggests about 40 2.5 MW turbines. Instead only
two 50 MW turbines would be required to fully utilise the ventila-
tion air. It is possible that the larger systems may be less susceptible
to the contaminants in the mine air as considerable research has
been undertaken by the aviation industry to provide gas turbines
that are capable of continuing operation upon encountering volcanic
dust or flocks of birds.

PMicroturbine technology can also be employed for the ancillary
use of low concentration methane. A FlexEnergy Microturbine, fitted
with a catalytic combustor capable of operating on a wide range of
fuels, has been used for VAM mitigation (http://www3.epa.gov/
cmop/docs/vam_technologies-12-2010.pdf; accessed on 5 May
2016). It was expected to achieve full power at a 1.5% methane con-
centration. The compressor(cid:1)combustor is a compact module con-
tained within turbine where hot compressed gases expand in the
turbine to power the generator. The FlexEnergy turbine has been
installed at the DCOR oil field near Santa Barbara, California, to con-
sume oil field gas at concentrations ranging from 1.5 to 4.2%, and
another is running on coal process waste gas at the Western
Research Institute in Laramie, Wyoming.

PVentilation air used as part or all of the input air for a power sta-
tion provides the required oxygen and the methane is oxidised read-
ily by interaction with a high temperature combustion process. It
may be used in power stations if VAM was appropriate as part of the
required combustion airflow. The main difficulty with this concept is
that the plant and the mine be located within reasonable distances
to limit transportation issues so the possibilities are limited. The
CSIRO has supported the research to design and build a 1.2 MW
rotary kiln system that uses waste coal and VAM, burned in a rotat-
ing kiln, to generate electricity via an externally fired steam turbine
system [142]. There are certainly technical potentials to use VAM for
stationary power generation.

PThere are other technologies for the ancillary use of low concen-
tration methane, e.g. fluidised bed. The essential description of a
fluidised bed is that an upward flow suspends solids to create a tur-
bulent mixing of any gases and solids that are contained or intro-
duced. Using a fluidised bed with VAM would either involve a heat
capturing solid, as in the design of TFRR and CFRR, capable of with-
standing the ignition temperature of the methane combined with
whatever fuel is also introduced. There are opportunities to reduce
the pollutants by the addition of limestone or dolomite to absorb
sulphur compounds. The fuel can also be a solid that burns and
ablates as the fuel is consumed. Numerous power plants currently
burn unprocessed waste coal as long as the calorific value is
7 MJ/kg or higher when the minimum criterion for boilers is met
[15]. The main issue with a fluidised bed is that it has been
designed for purpose, which may not have included the inclusion
of a premixed fuel as the inlet air, so the need for the system to at
least operate at a minimum temperature capable of fully oxidising
the methane is critical.

PThe potentials of technology development for the ancillary use of
low concentration methane are substantial, as the thermodynamic/
aerodynamic limits have not been fully explored. The burner design
also needs to be optimised. The VamTurBurner(cid:1) is a recently pro-
posed methane mitigation system [130,136] for the mitigation of
VAM. The principles of flameless combustion for lean premixed fuels
are exploited, such that a lean fuel(cid:1)air mixture will ignite and
undergo flameless combustion in the presence of an ignition source
given an initial temperature that is reasonably close to the ignition
temperature. The temperature of the ventilation air is elevated to a

Pvalue that, depending on the concentration of methane, will undergo
flameless combustion. Recirculating heat from the combustion
either by a heat exchanger or mixing the combustion products
increases the temperature of ventilation airflow in a similar manner
as the regenerative thermal oxidiser. The preheated ventilation air
stream is conditioned to ignite with very little further increase in
temperature upon encountering the igniters to undergo flameless
combustion and the heat generated by the ignition of the premixed
fuel supports continued ignition. This system provides some flexibil-
ity in dealing with CH4 concentration variability. The recirculation
heat flow was intended to be controlled as a function of the methane
concentration. At higher methane concentrations less recirculation
heat is required so more energy is available as the high temperature
gas transfers heat through exchange systems to produce steam to
generate electricity and further energy transfer systems may create
thermal products such as hot water.

PAs can be surmised from the technology review, the concept of
ultra-lean combustion is at the foundation of the limitations of
these technologies. By gaining a deeper understanding of ultra-lean
methane combustion the opportunity for technological advance-
ments for the mitigation of vast sources of methane becomes closer
to a reality. Further to that the potential for energy capture from
these new systems provides an added benefit and a potential cost
reduction mechanism.

4. Concluding remarks

PAlthough the largest source of anthropogenic greenhouse gas
emissions is CO2 from fossil fuel combustion, non-CO2 sources are
also important to the overall GHG impact [1,11]. The two major non-
CO2 GHGs are methane and nitrous oxide. For N2O, the co-existence
of multi-sources including anthropogenic and natural sources makes
the inventory estimates rather challenging. The atmospheric con-
centrations of N2O is also affected by activities such as fossil fuel
combustion, industrial processes, biomass burning and waste man-
agement release, but they are not the largest sources of N2O emis-
sions. Among the current anthropogenic N2O emissions of 3.1 § 0.8
GtCO2-eq per year [1], agricultural activities account for about 1.9
GtCO2-eq per year and industrial processes including fossil fuel com-
bustion account for about 0.8 GtCO2-eq per year. The challenges of
reducing the agricultural emissions of N2O are mainly associated
with controlling synthetic fertiliser use while maintaining the same
levels of or even increasing crop production. N2O emissions from
stationary combustion are primarily a result of the usage of coal flui-
dised bed boilers in the electric power sector. N2O is emitted directly
from the combustion of the fuel with air at moderate temperatures.
In general, the contribution of the stationary combustion to total
N2O emissions is not large, but the data uncertainty is high. The
emission of N2O is dependent on the temperature in the boilers. The
emission rates are the highest when the combustion temperature
ranges from 800 K to 1200 K, while the emissions are negligible
below 800 K and over 1200 K. The mechanisms of N2O chemistry
are relatively well understood though the experimental data
available are limited.
In addition to anthropogenic emissions,
N2O has natural sources which are predominantly terrestrial and
these emissions are highest in the tropics. However, the exact
contributions of natural sources remain difficult to identify for
atmosphere-based,
top-down inversion studies of emissions
[143,144] due to the co-existence of both anthropogenic and nat-
ural sources.

PFor N2O emissions, agricultural activities are the dominant
anthropogenic source, while other sources such as mobile source
fuel combustion and stationary fuel combustion also contribute.
Ozone depleting substance substitute emissions are the primary
contributors to aggregate HFC emissions and partly to PFC emissions.
PFC can also be emitted as a by-product of primary aluminium

Pproduction and from semiconductor manufacturing. Electrical trans-
mission and distribution systems accounted for most SF6 emissions,
while semiconductor manufacturing primarily led to NF3 emissions.
As HFCs are being phased out as the substitute for ODSs while PFC,
HFC, SF6, and NF3 emissions can be controlled by coordinated efforts
from the relevant manufacturing sectors, it is expected that the miti-
gation of these minor anthropogenic GHGs can be achieved without
major obstacles.

PConcerns on non-CO2 GHGs are mainly associated with methane
emissions, as the more active one of the two major non-CO2 GHGs
(in comparison with N2O). CH4 emissions, resulting primarily from
agricultural activities including enteric fermentation associated with
domestic livestock, natural gas systems, decomposition of wastes in
landfills, coal mines, oil explorations, etc., are the second largest
GHG source. Methane is an important GHG with anthropogenic
emissions accounting for about 20% of the total warming effects of
all GHGs, where the emissions from the energy sector (fossil fuel
exploitation) are one of the major sources. Reducing or mitigating
CH4 emissions while exploiting the potential utilisation of the ther-
mal energy have brought up a wide range of scientific, technological
and financial challenges. The adverse effect of CH4 emissions can be
potentially much larger because of the various positive feedback
mechanisms between methane emissions and climate change.
Accordingly mitigation of CH4 emissions may have a profound
impact on a wide range of areas.

PIt is worth noting that CH4 emissions from agriculture could
be larger than those from fossil fuel exploitation. Emissions from
the agriculture sector are mostly attributable to enteric fermen-
tation and manure management, representing non-point sources
of methane emissions, e.g. ruminant animals like cattle and
sheep are the major emitters of methane via enteric fermenta-
tion. The amount of methane emitted from enteric fermentation
depends on the feed quality and amount of feed ingested by the
animal. Usually it is not straightforward to cut the emissions
from non-point sources as they are not concentrated and there-
fore difficult for technical solutions. Options to reduce methane
emissions from enteric fermentation include improved animal
productivity and feed management. Even in the energy sector,
where emissions are often from point sources, capturing CH4
represents a technical and economical challenge.

PFor CH4 leakage from oil and gas systems, targeted collection can
vastly reduce the GHG emissions, where the collected CH4 can be
flared off as carbon dioxide or used as an additional fuel source. Cap-
turing or collecting the CH4 is a difficult task with technical difficul-
ties and financial implications. Su et al. [15] summarised the four
basic processes commonly used for gas purification activities and
discussed their basic characteristics and differences, including sol-
vent adsorption or selective absorption, pressure swing adsorption,
cryogenic separation and membrane separation. The technologies
can be used for rejecting nitrogen, carbon dioxide, oxygen, water,
etc., which can be used individually or combined together. In gen-
eral, nitrogen rejection is the most critical and expensive component
of any purification system. Although enrichment facilities have been
used successfully for upgrading medium quality gas from natural
gas wells to pipeline specifications, it is generally not economically
viable to purify the mixture streams when CH4 concentration is too
low.

PEnergy-related activities are responsible for the anthropogenic
emissions of CH4 and N2O. Although the mitigation of CH4 in the
form of VAM was the focal point in the context of this review,
some of the issues discussed are of a general nature, which can be
used in other areas such as the mitigation of CH4 from gas and oil
explorations, e.g. the chemical kinetics of ultra-lean methane mix-
ture oxidation/combustion. This topic is summarised as follows
and some promising research directions in the field are also briefly
discussed.

4.1. Challenges in combustion mitigation of ultra-lean methane
mixtures

PCurrently there are knowledge gaps in combustion mitigation of
ultra-lean methane. The challenges are both scientific and techno-
logical, involving a number of physicochemical factors affecting the
ignition and flame dynamics. Purposely designed experimentations
can certainly help gain insights, which are still lacking. For the
modelling of ultra-lean methane oxidation/combustion, chemical
kinetics represents the largest challenge. Presently there is a lack of
robust studies on ultra-lean CH4 combustion chemistry and kinetic
schemes that can be effectively used to describe the chemical pro-
cess and to be employed in numerical simulations to design efficient
combustion systems. There is a gap in the model availability for
applications concerning diluted combustion with extremely low CH4
concentrations.

POptimised chemical kinetic schemes especially reduced mecha-
nisms that work effectively with CFD codes are needed for engineer-
ing applications. The development of these schemes depends on an
in-depth understanding of the chemical reactions involved. Funda-
mental understanding on ultra-lean oxidation/combustion is still
lacking. A combination of fundamental studies of chemical kinetics
and reaction rates through well-defined and purposely designed
experiments and ab initio theoretical calculations, and of analyses of
global experimental measurements will play a major role in the fur-
ther developments of chemical schemes for ultra-lean CH4 oxida-
tion/combustion. Validation of the schemes is also important.
Systematic testing and validations also need to be supplemented by
UQ analyses to ensure the applicability of the schemes. Systematic
adjustments of kinetic parameters to experimental measure-
ments need to be carried out, together with model and parame-
ter evaluation. Chemical kinetic mechanisms need to be assessed
at different operating conditions: pressure level and preheating
effects on autoignition and flammability limits. Scheme optimisa-
tion, reduction and uncertainty quantification also need to be
performed to develop skeletal and reduced chemical schemes, to
be integrated into the simulation codes used for design purposes.
In addition, kinetics of catalytic combustion and plasma-assisted
ignition certainly need a substantial amount of effort, as this is
an area that may have huge technical potentials but the current
understanding is rather limited.

PIt is worth noting that, apart from chemical kinetics, the thermo-
dynamic/aerodynamic limits of burning ultra-lean methane in prac-
tical systems remain unexplored. Investigating the thermodynamic/
aerodynamic limits would include minimising heat losses from the
system, maximising fuel(cid:1)air mixing for oxidation, and optimising
the initial energy level to initiate the oxidation, which so far have
not been systematically investigated. This represents an area requir-
ing further research.

4.2. Promising research directions

PCurrently our understanding on non-CO2 GHGs is still limited,
where the inventory data are only estimates with inconsistencies.
Our ability to quantify both natural and anthropogenic non-CO2
GHG fluxes needs to be improved, so is our understanding on the
interactions between natural and anthropogenic GHGs. Fundamen-
tal scientific understanding on anthropogenic non-CO2 GHG emis-
sion mechanisms, sensitivities to and linkages with external factors
need to be carried out, which could form the basis for treaty compli-
ance, carbon-based trading markets and the initialisation of more
accurate estimation techniques. Research activities should include
enhancing observational networks and improving inverse modelling
techniques to allow more accurate estimates of regional emissions.
The stabilisation of climate forcing will be managed more effectively
with scientific advances that enhance our understanding of non-CO2

PGHG emissions, the sensitivities of the emissions to external factors,
the interactions between various non-CO2 GHGs as well as those
interactions with CO2. With such advances, the overall effectiveness
of mitigation efforts could be continuously assessed and optimised.
Improved scientific capabilities could also increase our ability to
reduce GHG emissions and may provide a better understanding of
the precise cuts in anthropogenic emissions needed to stabilise cli-
mate forcing.

PFurther fundamental research needs to be carried out to address
the effects of initial temperature and pressure on the flammability
limits of ultra-lean methane combustion. Currently, there is a lack of
in-depth understanding in a number of areas, e.g. the effects of sys-
tem heat and mass transfer characteristics, plasma-assisted ignition
and combustion, and the presence of catalysts on CH4 ignition and
oxidation/combustion. More specifically, questions need to be
answered about under which concentration the mixture can be
burned and under which conditions the oxidation/combustion can
be sustainable and stable, with the effects of one or a combination of
several of the influencing physicochemical factors.

POn the technical side, breakthroughs are needed in several areas.
For fugitive methane, effective capturing of the CH4 represents a
very significant challenge. The existing technologies need to be mas-
sively improved to become economical especially for low concentra-
tion emissions. For CH4 emissions from non-point sources, there is
currently no large-scale technology available for targeted collection.
Promising technologies such as the honeycomb monolithic carbon
fibre composites have been used for VAM enrichment [145], where
initial vacuum swing is a control step for the final methane concen-
tration having 5 or 11 times the VAM enrichment by one-step
adsorption and the mixture can be further enriched by second step
adsorption to a higher concentration avoiding the methane explo-
sive range of 5(cid:1)15%. To further reduce the capturing costs and to
scale up the technology are essential steps for these new technolo-
gies to be widely used.

PInnovative methods will play a major part in the development of
effective measures for cutting ultra-lean CH4 emissions. For exam-
ple, the mitigation of ultra-lean methane can be helped by plasma-
assisted combustion. As a promising new technology, the application
of plasma-assisted combustion to ultra-lean methane mitigation
needs to be further investigated, both experimentally and theoreti-
cally/numerically. The utilisation of catalysts is playing a significant
role in ultra-lean CH4 mitigation and utilisation. The relevant prog-
ress in MILD combustion can potentially provide an opportunity for
technical developments in this area, but the situation can be intrigu-
ing. The reduction of anthropogenic CH4 emissions using combus-
tion might also influence N2O emissions. As the combustion
temperature ranges from 800 K to 1200 K corresponding to the high-
est emission rates of N2O, this temperature level may partially over-
lap with the temperature regime where MILD combustion or ultra-
lean premixed combustion takes place. Although the combustion
emissions of N2O are believed to be insignificant, intriguing situa-
tions like this warrant further investigation. The advances in rele-
vant areas will benefit ultra-lean methane mitigation in due course.
PThe need for robust technologies for the treatment of ultra-lean
CH4 air mixtures calls for further investigation and optimisation of
recuperative combustion, involving flow and combustion control for
sustainable oxidation/combustion. From a technological perspective,
a combustion mitigation system has to provide some flexibility in
dealing with methane concentration variations. It has to be resistant
to changes in the concentration of methane when the heat flow is
recirculated. Ideally the heat flow needs to be controlled as a func-
tion of methane concentration. For low methane concentrations
more heat is required to raise the temperature to the sustainable
oxidation/combustion regime and as the methane concentration
increases less heat is required because a lower temperature is
required for a sustainable reaction. For the ignition of ultra-lean

Pmixtures, new technologies such as plasma-assisted ignition/com-
bustion can be potentially utilised. At the same time, catalysts may
be able to significantly enhance the ignition and oxidation/combus-
tion performances of ultra-lean methane air mixtures.

PBoth scientific and technical advances are needed in our combat
against global warming. The scientific advances should be able to
identify the sources of non-CO2 GHG emissions, to quantify the
emissions, and to elucidate the parameters affecting their emissions.
Meanwhile, technical advances should be able to provide economi-
cally viable mitigating measures to effectively cut the anthropogenic
emissions of non-CO2 GHGs.
