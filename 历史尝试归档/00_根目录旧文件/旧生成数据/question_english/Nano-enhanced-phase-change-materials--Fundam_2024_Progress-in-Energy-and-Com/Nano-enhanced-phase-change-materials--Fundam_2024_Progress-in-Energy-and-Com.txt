Phase Change Materials (PCMs) enable thermal energy storage in the form of latent heat during phase transition.
PCMs significantly improve the efficiency of solar power systems by storing excess energy, which can be used
during peak demand. Likewise, they also contribute to reduced overall energy demand through passive thermal
regulation. Nonetheless, thermal energy charging and discharging are restricted due to the low conducting na-
ture of the energy storage medium. Various research investigations are being carried out to improve the thermal
characteristics  of  PCMs  through  techniques  such  as  a)  dispersion  of  nanoparticles,  b)  inserting  fins,  and  c)
cascading  PCMs.  Among  the  techniques  mentioned  above,  the  dispersion  of  nanoparticles  is  reliable  and
economically viable. These materials are so-called nano-enhanced PCMs (NePCMs) that facilitate the charging
and discharging processes of the thermal energy storage (TES) units owing to their improved thermo physical
properties and long term stability. This paper presents a comprehensive review with implications and inferences
on  research  conducted  using  nano-enhanced  phase  change  materials  (NePCMs)  in  recent  years.  Initially,  the
article discusses the highly preferred synthesis methods of NePCMs in addition to its morphological and ther-
mophysical characterization techniques. Then, an acute focus on the impact of distinct dimensional  nano ad-
ditives like zero-dimensional (0D), one-dimensional (1D), two-dimensional (2D), and three-dimensional (3D) on
inclusion  with  PCMs  are  elaborately  discussed.  A  deep  discussion  on  emerging  and  hybrid  nanoparticles
dispersed PCMs with emphasis on a) the interaction mechanism of nanoparticle & phase change material (PCM)
and b) influences on enhancing the thermophysical properties (melting point, thermal conductivity, latent heat
capacity, thermal diffusivity, and thermal stability) of NePCMs are discussed. Indeed, including nanomaterials
within  the  PCM  matrix  resulted  in  variations  in  thermal  conductivity  and  heat  storage  enthalpy.  With  nano-
material NePCM displayed 80–150 % increment in organic PCM as their proportion of nanomaterial inclusion is
about 1–2 %, whereas for form and shape stable PCM enhancement of 700–900 % in thermal conductivity is
noticed; however, there was a drop in heat storage enthalpy owing to the inclusion of nanomaterial in weight
fraction of 5–20 %. Furthermore included in this review article are insights on significant advances, challenges,
and outlooks for enhancing NePCMs in the field of advanced thermal applications. This review article is expected
to have a particular reference value that would provide notable insight to readers to explore the fundamental
properties  of  NePCM  further.  Additionally,  as  there  is  alarming  interest  in  the  field  of  TES  late  after  the
framework  of  sustainable  development  goals  (SDG)s  by  the  United  Nations  in  2015,  this  review  article  is

anticipated to make a remarkable impact towards SDG 7-Affordable and Clean Energy, by providing technical
insights towards enhancing the renewable energy sources assisted with TES.

1. Introduction

Thermal  energy  storage  (TES)  is  an  essential  technique  for  large-
scale deployment of renewable energy and the transition to decarbon-
ized buildings and energy systems. TES offers the facility to store ther-
mal  energy  for  later  use,  which  minimizes  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)
emissions and reduces operating costs by switching the peak demand.
There are three distinct forms of thermal energy storage: sensible heat
storage, latent heat storage, and chemical energy storage. Utilizing the
latent heat of phase change materials (PCMs) for solar thermal energy
storage is considered the most favourable approach. Due to their ability
to transfer heat from the molecular level to real-time applications, PCMs
are  of  tremendous  interest  in  TES.  PCMs  extend  its  footprints  to
numerous  applications  like  a)  solar  thermal  systems  [1],  b)  thermal
regulation of buildings, c) electronic gadgets, d) cold storage of foods
and  medicines,  e)  aerospace,  f)  garments  &  safety  vests,  and  in  g)
photovoltaic
thermal  panels.  Melting,  solidifying,  evaporation,
condensation,  sublimation,  and  deposition  all  require  energy.  Heat  is
absorbed or released when a material transforms from solid to liquid or
vice versa.

As a result, PCMs promptly change their phase in response to specific
energy input and release the stored specific energy later. PCM is reliant
on latent heat storage. The storage has no temperature change compared
to the storage of perceptible heat. On a keen note, every material is a
phase-change material in some ways because, given pressure and tem-
perature  combinations,  every  material  can  change  its  aggregate  state
(solid,  liquid,  gaseous).  A  considerable  quantity  of  energy,  known  as
latent heat, can be stored or released during a change in aggregate state
at  a  nearly  constant  temperature.  As  a  result,  a  slight  temperature
change can be used to store and release energy. These phase transition
materials absorb thermal energy from the high temperature surround-
ings  while  solid-liquid  phase  transfer  and  supports  a  steady  state
ambiance  of  the  surroundings.  The  absorbed  energy  increases  the
overall energy of atoms and molecules of PCM, resulting in vibration at
high  frequency;  this  vibration  loosens  the  intermolecular  bonding  of
atoms  and  molecules  at  the  melting  point  of  PCM  and  causes  phase
transition from solid-liquid [2].

Conversely, PCM releases the absorbed thermal energy to the envi-
ronment  when  the  surrounding  temperature  drops  below  the  phase
transition  temperature  of  PCM.  With  thermal  energy  discharge,  PCM
particles self-align themselves into the solid form [3] and prepare for the
next  charging  cycle.  Thermal  energy  absorbed  or  released  during  the
phase transition of PCM from solid-liquid and liquid-solid is known as
enthalpy of fusion [4]. PCM supports a net-zero target, as they offer to
store  sustainable  and  clean  energy.  The  a)  heat  transfer  and  b)  heat
storage/release  are  two  important  phenomena  that  are  significant  in
phase change material during its application. Heat transfer in PCMs can
be modeled using the heat conduction equation, with an additional term
to account for the latent heat during the phase change. The basic heat
conduction equation in one dimension is given by Fourier’s law as in
Equation (1):

∂T
∂t

= α

∂2T
∂x2

Equation (1)

Where T is the temperature, t is the time, x is the position, and α is the
thermal diffusivity of the material.

During the phase change, the PCM absorbs or releases a significant
amount of heat, known as latent heat, without a temperature change. To
incorporate this into the heat conduction equation, an additional source
term is added to represent the latent heat as in Equation (2):

∂T
∂t

= α

∂2T
∂x2

+ 1
ρcp

dH
dt

Equation (2)

Where ρ is the density of the material, cp is the specific heat capacity, dH
dt
is the rate of latent heat absorption or release, which is significant during
the phase change.

Similarly the amount of heat stored or released by a PCM during the

phase change can be described by Equation (3):

Q = m L

Equation (3)

Where Q is the heat absorbed or released, m is the mass of the PCM, L is
the latent heat of fusion (for solid-liquid transition) or solidification (for
liquid-solid transition).

To  calculate  the  total  energy  stored  or  released,  both  the  sensible
heat  (due  to  temperature  change)  and  the  latent  heat  (due  to  phase
change) need to be considered. The total heat (Qtotal) can be expressed as
in Equation (4):

Qtotal = m cpΔT + m L

Equation (4)

Where  ΔT  is  the  temperature  change  during  the  heating  or  cooling
process before or after the phase change occurs.

This mathematical formulation provides a basic framework to model
the heat transfer and heat storage in PCMs. By solving these equations,
one can predict the temperature distribution and the amount of thermal
energy  stored  or  released  by  the  PCM,  which  is  crucial  for  designing
effective thermal management and energy storage systems. Advanced
models  may  also  incorporate  convection  and  radiation  effects  and
changes in material properties with temperature and phase.

Visually, when phase transition occurs in solid-solid PCM, there is no
change in appearance. Still, there is little or no expansion or contraction
changes  when  it  undergoes  solid-solid  transformation.  This  trans-
formation involves high latent heat energy comparable to solid-liquid
PCMs.  Subsequently,  organic  PCMs  are  reliable  owing  to  its  a)  non-
toxic  nature,  b)  congruent  melting/freezing,  c)  non-corrosive  with
metals, b) phase stability, and e) facilitate long term usage without loss
in thermal features [5]. However, certain inherent limits exist due to low
thermal conductivity, flammability, and lack of control over heat stor-
age time and heat dissipation temperature [6].

Consequently,  to  overcome  the  shortcomings  in  thermophysical
properties, a few heat transfer improvement strategies have been rec-
ommended alike: a) integration of heat pipes and fins [7]; b) dispersion
of  highly  conductive  materials;  c)  microencapsulation  [8]  and  d)
nanoencapsulation [9]. Among these strategies, the dispersion of high
thermal  conductivity  nanometer-sized  elements  in  the  PCM,  such  as
nanoparticles,  nanofibers,  nanotubes,  and  nanosheets,  considerably
boosts the thermal conductivity of the PCM matrix [10]. Because of high
thermal  conductance  and  better  surface  area  to  volume  ratio,  nano-
particles are dispersed with PCMs, enhancing their thermal conductivity
during  both  the  charging  and  discharging  cycles  concerning  the  mel-
ting/freezing process. In addition, nanoparticles exhibit unique photo-
thermal  characteristics,  which  assist  in  enhanced  absorbance  of
electromagnetic radiation for harnessing solar energy.

1.1. Classification of phase change material

PCMs  represent  a  category  of  substances  distinguished  by  their
ability to absorb or release substantial latent heat when undergoing a
phase transition, such as the transformation from a solid to a liquid or
from a liquid to a gas [11]. Depending on phase transition, PCMs are
solid-to-gas,  and
categorized  as

solid-to-liquid,

solid-to-solid,

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience104(2024)1011622

Z. Said et al.

liquid-to-gas vice versa. Among the above, the solid-to-liquid transition
of PCMs  indicates ample application  potentials in energy storage and
thermal regulation units owing to high-energy storage capability, a wide
range of phase change temperatures, and a small volume change rate
[12]. Solid-to-liquid PCMs are further classified based on their material
compound as a) Low molecular compounds and b) Polymers. Further-
more, the low molecular compounds of PCM are categorized as organic
(paraffin, sugar alcohol, esters, glycols, fatty acids, and alcohols), inor-
ganic  (salt  hydrates  and  metallic)  &  eutectic  (organic-organic;
organic-inorganic; inorganic-inorganic). The polymers are classified as
polyethylene glycol, which provides variable phase transition temper-
atures  depending  on  their  average  molecular  weight  [13].  However,
PCMs are categorized using various criteria, considering things like their
intended use, chemical makeup, and physical state. The classification of
PCMs are as follows; subsequently, Fig. 1 presents the organization chart
of PCM classification along with advantages and disadvantages.

1.1.1. Based on the physical state of PCM

Based on the physical state of the material PCM are classified into
two  categories,  i.e.,  inorganic  and  organic  compounds.  PCMs  in  this
category  include  materials  such  as  paraffins,  fatty  acids,  and  esters,
which are often composed of organic molecules. The unique quality of
these materials is their capacity to go through phase changes at tem-
peratures suitable for various uses. Organic PCMs are integral to effec-
tive  thermal  energy  management  and  are  well-known  for  their
remarkable  latent  heat  storage  capability.  Typically,  a  molecular
framework made up of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms is used to
produce  organic  PCMs.  These  compounds  often  fall  within  distinct
classes,  including  fatty  acids,  alkanes,  esters,  or  alcohols.  During  the
phase transition, organic PCMs can store and release substantial thermal

energy due to their high latent heat storage capacity. In contrast, PCMs
that are not organic include metals, salts, and eutectic mixes. Inorganic
PCMs can be distinguished from their organic counterparts by having
higher  thermal  conductivity  and  higher  density.  Inorganic  PCMs  can
withstand various temperatures and frequently exhibit strong thermal
conductivity. They can be employed in conditions where durability and
stability at high temperatures are essential as they are often stable. In
many different systems where accurate temperature control is crucial,
inorganic PCMs are used. They are particularly beneficial in applications
where the material must endure harsh environments or high tempera-
ture variations.

1.1.2. Based on chemical composition of material

Based  on the  chemical composition  of  the  matter, the  PCM are  of
three types; salt hydrates, paraffin, and easter. Salt hydrates are inor-
ganic PCMs that consist of salts combined with water molecules. Salt
hydrates are signified as AxBy•nH2O, where n symbolizes the amount of
water molecules, AxBy symbolizes the type of salt (carbonate, chloride,
nitrate,  phosphate,  &  sulfate).  Common  examples  include  calcium
chloride  hexahydrate,  magnesium  sulfate  heptahydrate,  and  sodium
sulfate decahydrate. Salt hydrate is formed via ion-dipole bonds, which
are polar molecules and anion combinations that hold salt and hydrate
together. Salt hydrates have high latent heat storage capacity but can
suffer  from  supercooling,  corrosive  nature,  and  phase  separation.
Common  salts  used  in  salt  hydrate  PCMs  include  sodium  sulfate
(Na2SO4),  magnesium  sulfate  (MgSO4),  and  calcium  chloride  (CaCl2)
[14]. The salts are typically combined with water to form a hydrate. The
water molecules become part of the crystal structure during the phase
transition. The crystalline structure of salt hydrates contributes to their
stability  and  ability  to  undergo  repeated  phase  transitions  without

significant degradation [14]. Paraffins, also known as paraffin waxes,
are a type of organic PCM commonly used for thermal energy storage.
These  materials  undergo  a  phase  transition  between  solid  and  liquid
states, absorbing and releasing significant latent heat during the process.
Paraffins are hydrocarbons, meaning they consist primarily of carbon
and  hydrogen  atoms.  Paraffins  are  composed  of  long-chain  hydrocar-
bons, primarily alkanes (saturated hydrocarbons). They have a general
formula  of  CnH2n+2.  Paraffins  are  chemically  stable  and  can  undergo
repeated phase transitions without significant degradation. Examples of
paraffins  include  various  types  of  alkane  hydrocarbons  with  different
chain lengths, such as octadecane (C18H38) and eicosane (C20H42) [15].
The next classification is Fatty acid and Easters, Fatty acids and esters, as
organic PCMs [15], transition between solid and liquid states, releasing
or  absorbing  latent  heat  in  the  process.  Their  molecular  structures,
characterized by hydrocarbon chains and functional groups, contribute
to their phase change behaviour. Fatty acids, found in natural fats and
oils, and esters, derived from carboxylic acid-alcohol reactions, are in-
tegral to applications requiring controlled thermal energy management
due  to  their  effective  heat  absorption  and  release  capabilities.  Fatty
acids consist of a hydrocarbon chain with a carboxyl group (–COOH) at
one end. Fatty acids can be saturated (containing only single bonds) or
unsaturated (containing double or triple bonds). Fatty acids are often
biodegradable and environmentally friendly. They can be derived from
renewable sources such as vegetable oils. Esters are organic compounds
with a general structure RCOOR’, where R and R′ are organic groups.
Esters are often derived from carboxylic acids and alcohols. Like fatty
acids, esters undergo a phase transition between solid and liquid states,
with a specific melting point. Esters are generally low in toxicity and can
be considered safer than some other PCM options.

1.1.3. Based on the melting temperature of material

Based on melting point temperature, the PCM are classified as low
temperature;  medium  temperature;  and  high  temperature  PCM.  Low-
temperature PCMs have a phase change temperature below room tem-
perature. They are appropriate for use in cold storage and refrigeration,
for example. PCMs that have a phase change temperature between room
◦
temperature and around 100
C are referred to as medium temperature;
these PCMs are frequently employed in electronic cooling and building
materials.  Additionally,  high  temperature  PCMs,  which  have  phase
◦
change temperatures above 100
C, are made for applications requiring
high-temperature  heat  storage.  Metal  alloys  and  molten  salts  are  two
instances of high-temperature PCMs.

1.2. Niche techniques to improve properties of phase change material

By tailoring and optimizing the properties of PCM, one can increase
both  their  effectiveness  and  versatility.  Heat  conductivity,  stability,
dependability, and alignment with application needs are qualities that
these  approaches  aim  to  improve.  A  few  standard  methods  used  to
improve PCM characteristics are listed below:

1.2.1. Nano-encapsulation

Nano-encapsulation of PCMs involves enclosing them within nano-
scale capsules or particles [16]. This innovative technique significantly
improves  PCM  performance  and  versatility  across  industries.  By
encapsulating  PCMs  within  nanoscale  shells  or  matrices,  issues  like
leakage,  poor  thermal  conductivity,  and  integration  difficulties  with
other materials, which commonly occur when using bulk PCMs directly,
are  effectively  addressed.  Typically  utilizing  materials  such  as
carbon-based structures, silica, or polymers, nano-encapsulation forms a
protective  layer  around  the  PCM  [17].  This  process  safeguards  PCMs
from  degradation,  ensuring  long-term  stability  and  durability  while
simultaneously  enhancing  thermal  conductivity  through  the  use  of
nanomaterials  as  encapsulates,  enabling  faster  heat  transfer  during
phase  transitions.  Nano-encapsulated  PCMs  can  be  seamlessly  inte-
grated  into  various  materials,  including  composites,  construction

materials, and textiles, without compromising their structural integrity.

1.2.2. Adoption of nano-structured materials in PCM

Using nanostructured materials, such as nanoparticles or nanofibers,
in  PCMs  significantly  enhances  their  performance  in  various  applica-
tions.  Nanostructured  materials  offer  a  larger  surface  area  than  bulk
materials, improving  the  contact  area between  the PCM  and  its  envi-
ronment.  This  augmentation  results  in  more  efficient  heat  exchange
during phase transitions. Furthermore, nanostructured materials exhibit
improved heat conductivity. When dispersed within PCMs, they act as
effective heat-transfer channels, expediting rapid and efficient thermal
energy  dispersion.  Such  enhancements  are  particularly  beneficial  in
applications  requiring  swift  heat  exchange,  such  as  electrical  devices
and thermal energy storage systems.

1.2.3. Hybrid PCM composites

Hybrid  PCM  composites,  combining  PCMs  with  polymers,  nano-
particles,  or  reinforcing  materials,  yield  composite  materials  with
improved  thermal properties  and mechanical  strength. These custom-
izable  composites  cater  to  specific  needs  like  enhanced  thermal  con-
ductivity,  mechanical  reinforcement,  stability,  or  adjustable  phase
transition  temperatures.  They  serve  various  sectors,  including  con-
struction, textiles, electronics, and renewable energy systems, providing
efficient thermal regulation and energy storage for diverse purposes.

1.2.4. Eutectic mixtures

A  eutectic  mixture  combines  two  or  more  substances  in  specific
proportions, resulting in a collective melting point lower than any in-
dividual component [18]. When discussing PCMs, a “eutectic mixture”
refers to specific material blends with lower melting points than their
separate constituents. The composition where this mixture reaches its
minimum  melting  temperature  is  termed  the  eutectic  point,  present
within  these  combinations.  Eutectic  PCM  mixtures  offer  notable  ad-
vantages in thermal energy storage applications [19]. These blends can
be  tailored  to  suit  specific  thermal  requirements,  providing  high
adaptability.  Engineered  to  address  issues  like  phase  separation  and
undercooling,  eutectic  mixes  ensure  consistent  and  reliable  heat
performance.

1.2.5. Polymer–PCM blends

Polymer–PCM blends are composite materials combining polymers
(plastics)  with  PCMs.  This  blending  aims  to  leverage  the  beneficial
properties  of  both  constituents  resulting  in  a  material  with  improved
thermal  characteristics.  Typically,  the  foundation  of  the  blend  is  a
polymer matrix [20]. Polymers offer structural support, flexibility, and
ease  of  processing,  rendering  them  suitable  for  diverse  applications.
Organic  or  inorganic  PCMs  capable  of  storing  and  releasing  thermal
energy during phase transitions are integrated in the polymer matrix.
Popular PCM options include paraffins, fatty acids, or salt hydrates.

1.2.6. Use of phase change emulsions

Phase change emulsions comprise small droplets of PCMs dispersed
within  a  continuous  liquid  phase,  often  a  water-based  solution.  An
emulsifying  agent  stabilizes  these  droplets,  ensuring  a  homogeneous
mixture  and  preventing  their  coalescence.  Leveraging  water’s  high
natural thermal conductivity as the continuous phase, These emulsions
enhance overall thermal conductivity, facilitating efficient heat trans-
mission  during  the  PCM’s  phase  transition.  Emulsification  addresses
issues associated with direct usage of bulk PCMs by minimizing leakage
or  phase  separation.  These  emulsions  find  applications  in  controlled
drug  delivery  systems  and  hyperthermia  treatments,  particularly  in
scenarios requiring precise temperature control.

1.2.7. Surface modification

Surface modification of PCMs involves altering the surface properties
of PCM particles or containers to enhance performance, stability, and

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience104(2024)1011624

Z. Said et al.

compatibility  with  other  materials  [21].  This  approach  targets  chal-
lenges  like  low  thermal  conductivity,  leakage,  and  integration  issues
with different matrices. Coating PCM particles with nanostructures such
as nanoparticles or nanocomposites increases surface area and improves
thermal  conductivity,  facilitating  efficient  heat  transmission  during
phase transitions. Polymer coatings stabilize and encase PCM particles,
preventing phase separation and leakage while enhancing compatibility
with various materials for diverse applications [22]. Shell-and-core ar-
chitectures  protect  PCM  particles  by  creating  a  protective  shell,
enhancing  longevity  by  mitigating  chemical  reactions  and  moisture
absorption.  Functionalizing  PCM  particle  surfaces  with  additional
functional groups enhances interactions with matrices, improving me-
chanical  and  thermal  performance.  These  surface  modifications  also
enhance  the  heat  stability  of  PCMs,  enabling  multiple  phase  change
cycles without degradation.

1.2.8. Surfactant

The enhancement of thermophysical properties  highly depends  on
the uniform dispersion of nanoparticles within the PCM matrix without
agglomeration and clustering. In order to stabilize particle suspensions
and  stop  particle  cluster  agglomeration,  researchers  have  looked  into
surfactants. To increase the stability of colloidal suspensions, surfactant
keeps the nano-filler in place and prevents it from settling or clumping.
Organic  compounds  with  hydrophilic  and  lipophilic  properties  are
known  as  surfactants.  The  addition  of  the  surfactant  to  NePCMs  will
alter the characteristics of the particle surface and inhibit the formation
of  clusters.  Nano-filler  agglomeration  will  be  inhibited  by  the  hydro-
phobic  tail,  creating  a  stearic  hindrance  on  the  particle’s  surface.
Regarding ionic surfactants, electrostatic repulsion is produced by the
same  charge  on  the  particle  surface.  The  surfactant  properties  of  sig-
nificant  electrostatic  repulsion  and  stearic  hindrance  facilitate  PCM
nano-filler  stabilization.  The  stability  of  the  composites  will,  on  the
other hand, decrease with increasing surfactant concentration. The heat
resistance  between  the  PCMs  and  the  nanofiller  may  be  increased  in
some instances [23].

1.2.9. Skeleton enhancement

Thermal  enhancement  effects  are  exceptionally  high  for  skeleton
materials,  represented  by  foams  and  fins.  The  fins  increase  the  heat
exchange rate between the PCMs and the thermal management collec-
tion  system, which  enhances  overall energy  utilization, and  the  foam
materials’  thermal  transport  network  increases  their  thermal  conduc-
tivity.  A  key  strategy  for  thermally  enhancing  PCMs  is  using  a  high
thermal  conductive  skeleton  alongside  incorporating  high  thermally
conductive nanoparticles. Additionally, by insulating the PCMs from the
effects of the external environment, this measurement can speed up the
storage and release of thermal energy. The most often used skeletons are
made of foam graphite and open-cell foam metals [24]. The composites’
exceptional anisotropic thermal conductivity, huge specific surface area,
and intricate 3D network topologies provide them with ultra-high TES
performance, as evidenced by the barely noticeable decrease in the total
TES capacity. The close contact between the PCMs and the foam metal
skeleton accelerates thermal transport; additionally, pore size is a key
variable  affecting  the  thermal  conductivity  of  PCM  composites.  The
mobility and dispersibility problems of nanoparticles do not affect the
foam  and  fin  skeleton.  Rather,  the  PCM  composites  have  a  high  TES
because of their extensive heat exchange surface and intricate linking
structures [25]. Additionally, the foam and fin skeletons may be effec-
tively  adapted  to  heat  convection  in  the  liquid  state  as  well  as  heat
conduction in the solid state.

1.2.10. Grafting PCMs

The  process  of  grafting  involves  the  incorporation  of  PCM  into  a
matrix  or  substrate,  thereby  improving  its  thermal  properties  for  ap-
plications like TES. This can be achieved through chemical bonding or
physical dispersion techniques, ensuring a uniform PCM distribution. By

enhancing thermal conductivity, grafting enables the seamless integra-
tion  of  PCM  into  different  products,  allowing  for  efficient  thermal
management. Xiao et al. [26] proposed a thermally initiated encapsu-
lation molding strategy involving PCM grafting into the polymer back-
bones to develop a 3D geometry. In chemical grafting methods, complex
chemical reactions occur between the active functional groups present
on the surface of monomers or polymer chains and the PCM, resulting in
the grafting of the PCM onto the polymer. Both chemical grafting and
microencapsulation methods can substantially accommodate high loads
of phase change materials (PCMs). Nevertheless, the preparation  pro-
cesses associated with these techniques are intricate, involving complex
chemical reactions and interface considerations. A range of shape-stable
and flexible solid-state phase change materials (PCM) were successfully
synthesized through the chemical grafting of polyethylene glycol (PEG)
within polymer hard segments [27]. These materials exhibited PEG soft
segments that could transition between ordered and disordered phases.

1.3. Impact of nanomaterial in enhancing the property of phase change
material

Nanoparticles  are  a  novel,  cutting-edge  material  that  is  gaining
prominence  in  the  field  of  energy  storage  due  to  its  unique  intrinsic
features.  One  of  the  most  exciting  parts  of  nanotechnology  is  the
dispersion  of  nanoparticles  to  diverse  materials  to  generate  nano-
composites; since its introduction, innovative combinations of qualities
have been available [28]. Generally, nanoparticles are either metallic
(metals; metal oxides; metal nitrides and metal carbides) or non-metallic
(silica; carbonaceous) [29]. ’’Nanoparticles’’ are particles with at least
one  dimension  ranging  from  1  to  100  nm.  Nanoparticles  have  the
uniqueness to be synthesized in any imaginable shape like a) discs; b)
sphere;  c)  rods;  d)  tubes;  e)  platelets;  f)  cubes,  and  so  on.  The  nano-
particle  morphology  (size,  structure,  and  shape)  influences  the  nano-
particles  properties  and  features.  Several  methods  or  approaches  are
utilized  to  prepare  stable,  uniformly  distributed  nanocomposite,
although the single-step and two-step methods are the most popular. The
synthesis and dispersion of nanoparticles in the base PCM are conducted
simultaneously in one step in the single-step approach. In contrast, the
nanoparticle in the two-step technique is synthesized independently by
physical or chemical synthesis method and subsequently disseminated
in the base PCM.

Integrating  nanoparticles  within  PCM  matrices  enhances  the  heat
transfer  rates  during  phase  transition  procedures  [30].  By  leveraging
materials such as metal nanoparticles, graphene, and carbon nanotubes,
these  additives  significantly  improve  thermal  conductivity  within  the
composite. The nanoparticles facilitate efficient heat transfer, acceler-
ating phase transitions and bolstering overall thermal performance [31].
Nano-sized particles substantially increase the surface area within the
PCM composite, fostering enhanced interaction with the PCM for more
effective  heat  distribution.  Their  incorporation  mitigates  issues  of
thermal  stratification,  ensuring  uniform  heat  dispersion  and  averting
localized  temperature  inconsistencies.  This  augmentation  in  thermal
conductivity translates to heightened efficiency in heat exchange pro-
cesses,  particularly  beneficial  in  applications  necessitating  rapid  and
efficient heat transfer [32]. Nano-engineered phase transition materials
with very high energy densities and multiple degrees of design freedom
in  defining  their  composition  and  morphology  are  one  promising
approach  for  thermal  energy  storage.  Most  of  the  developed  nano-
composite, credited to nanoparticles, exhibits improved thermophysical
properties,  optical  absorptivity,  and  chemical  stability.  Two  dimen-
sional,  high  porous  nanomaterials  facilitate  un-reflected  electromag-
netic waves to flow through and undergo internal reflections between
the layers, finally being absorbed within the structures with no emission,
causing an increase in optical absorbance. Unique 3D nanomaterials can
self-assemble  in  interconnected,  well-distributed,  highly  porous,  and
entangled  networks,  which  offers  many  advantages  in  many  techno-

thermophysical property enhancements are high surface-to-volume area
of the nanoparticle (decreasing the nanoparticle size increases its surface
area).  Moreover,  the  interaction  between  nanoparticle  and  base  PCM
will cause a change in morphologies as a) dispersed morphology (stable
nanocomposite owing to no interaction between nanoparticle, causing
more  interaction  between  nanoparticle  and  PCM);  b)  intercalated
morphology  (non-homogenous  properties  owing  to  local  interaction
between  nanoparticle  and  PCM  matrix)  and  c)  agglomerated
morphology (low interaction between nanoparticle and PCM).

Although PCMs are widely recognized for their capabilities in this
particular  domain,  their  inherent  limitation  lies  in  their  low  conduc-
tivity,  which  hampers  their  efficiency  in  the  processes  of  energy
charging and discharging. There exists a scientific gap in terms of review

aims  to  fill  a  research  gap  by  proposing  the  notion  of  NePCMs.

NePCMs were databases such as Google Scholar and Scopus. The focus
was directed towards publications in the English language spanning the
years 2011–2023. The databases were chosen based on their extensive
assortment of scholarly publications and stringent peer-review proced-
ures.  The  nanoparticles  used  in  experimental  and  numerical  studies
include graphite, copper, copper oxide, titanium oxide, aluminum oxide,
graphene oxide, etc. When added to PCM, these nanoparticles enhance
the thermophysical properties of NePCM, which ultimately improve the
heat  transfer  ability  of  PCMs  [51].  Our  research  was  primarily  con-

ization, stability, and applications of NePCMs. The review focused on

enhanced  Phase  Change  Materials”  (NePCMs),  “thermal  energy  stor-
age,”  “latent heat,”  and other terminologies associated  with NePCMs.
The search approach employed in this study was not limited to a certain
geographic location or country, therefore ensuring a comprehensive and
worldwide perspective on the subject matter. Significant emphasis was
placed  on  articles  that  presented  methodologies,  obstacles,  and  pro-

2. Synthesis and characterization of nanoparticle enhanced
phase change material

The nano PCMs have been prepared in the literature using various
methods, and researchers have investigated several techniques to pre-
pare  them.  NePCMs  can  be  either  prepared  using  one-step,  two-step,
three-step, or four-step techniques. In the one-step technique, both the
PCM  and  nanoparticles  are  synthesized  simultaneously,  while  in  the
two-step  technique,  the  PCM  and  nanoparticles  are  synthesized  sepa-
rately  in two distinct steps.  The two-step technique is  widely used to
prepare nano PCM. Moreover, three-step techniques involve impregna-
tion, compression, and sintering processes to prepare nano PCM. Similar
to the three-step synthesis, a four-step synthesis involves four distinct
stages.  This  could  include  synthesizing  the  PCM,  synthesizing  the
nanoparticles,  modifying  the  nanoparticles  or  PCM  surface,  and  then
dispersing the modified nanoparticles into the PCM. These methods that
have been used to prepare nano PCMs are discussed below.

2.1. Steps techniques of NePCM synthesis

The selection of the synthesis technique of NePCM relies on various
factors, including the desired characteristics of the nanocomposite PCM,
the availability of research facilities, and the application’s specific re-
quirements. Each technique presents distinct benefits and difficulties in
regulating  nanoparticle  dispersion,  uniformity,  scalability,  and  the
properties of the resulting nanocomposite PCM. Xu et al. [63], used a
single-step method to prepare nano PCM using copper oxide, sulphur,
oleic acid, multi-wall carbon nanotubes, and paraffin wax. The mixture
◦
was placed in a 50 ml flask, and stirring was done at 180
C for about 3 h.
It was used in various applications after the final preparation of nano
PCMs. Nano PCMs were developed by Jamil et al. [64] using a two-step
approach  for  application  in  photovoltaic  technology.  The  fabrication
process  involved  stirring  and  sonication  to  mix  multi-walled  carbon
nanotubes (MWCNTs), graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs), and magnesium
oxide  nanoparticles with  paraffin  wax.  Stirring  was  performed  for  60
min, and sonication was carried out at 40 Hz using an ultrasonic cleaner.
Paul et al. [65] also used a two-step method to prepare nano PCM.
They  mixed  hybrid  graphene–silver  nano  fillers  in  paraffin  having  a
melting  temperature  of  25
C  at  various  concentrations.  The  results
indicated  that  the  value  of  the  thermal  conductivity  of  samples  was

raised  by  a  maximum  of  90  %  with  0.3  wt%  dispersion  of  graphe-
ne–silver  nano  fillers.  By  employing  a  two-step  synthesis  method,
nanoparticle dispersed PCM can be effectively created. This involves the
independent synthesis of both the PCM and nanoparticles, granting the
ability  to  fine  tune  their  characteristics  before  amalgamation.  As  a
result,  tailored  nanocomposites  are  obtained,  catering  to  the  unique
requirements  of  various  applications.  Yuan  et  al.  [66]  investigated
three-step impregnation, compression, and sintering techniques to pre-
pare nano PCM. The ethylene glycol was placed in the muffle furnace
with various weight fractions with erythritol/EG composite PCM. The
mixture was mixed and stirred to the thermal stability. After that, the
mixture was compressed in a cylindrical mold having 50 mm diameter
and thickness of 40 mm at 6 MPa pressure for 1 min. In the end, sintering
was done in the mixture in the furnace to increase the temperature. The
technique  of  impregnation,  compression,  and  sintering  in  three  steps
provides  accurate  management  of  nanoparticle  dispersion  in  PCM,
enhancing both thermal conductivity and stability. Impregnation gua-
rantees complete saturation, compression enhances interfacial bonding,
and  sintering  encourages  cohesion.  This  approach  produces  nano-
composites with customized thermal properties ideal for a range of TES
uses.  Sheng  et  al.  [67]  utilized  a  four-step  technique  for  nano  PCM
preparation containing aluminum NPs of different sizes in acetone. The
mixture was stirred at 1500 rpm for about half an hour and then cooled.
The mixture was hot pressed at 10 KN for 1.5 h, then cut horizontally to
create a proper shape. Table 1 shows the overview of recent literature
for nano PCM preparation using step methods. Besides, the technique

stirring-gelation-aging-drying, and ultrasonication process are in Fig. 4.
Zhen and Wei [68] attempted to encapsulate n-eicosane (PCM) using
silica  via  sol-gel  method.  The  sol-gel  encapsulation  process  involves
agitates  of  the  composite  with  an  emulsifier;  during  this  process,  the
hydrophilic segment of the emulsifier assembles along the hydrophobic
chains to orient PCM with the silica sol. Fig. 4a displays the step-by-step
process of preparation of nano-encapsulated PCM via sol-gel technique
involving agitation and drying. In another work, Wu et al. [69] devel-
oped a form stable PCM with strong rigidity via a vacuum impregnation
technique involving sonication-dipping-coating. PEG was used as PCM,
with  nanofiber/graphene  nanoplatelet  as  a  nanomaterial,  and  it  was
coated using melamine foam. Fig. 4b presents the step by step of the
vacuum  impregnation  technique;  during  this  method  initially,  the
nanocomposite  PCM  is  initially  developed  via  stirring  and  sonication
process.  Following  the  nanocomposite  PCM,  the  foam  melamine  is
dispersed with the nanocomposite solution, which involves repeated dip
coating  and  vacuum  impregnation  of  the  composite.  This  technique
improves the phase stability and long term operation of the developed
nanocomposite  PCM.  Likewise,  Marske  et  al.  [70]  developed  a  shape
stabilized PCM specifically for construction materials to offer thermal
regulation of buildings. In this research work, butyl stearate was opted
as  PCM  along  with  silica  matrix  as  coated  material  and  surfactant  to
ensure uniform dispersion. The shape stabilized PCM was developed via
in  situ  sol-gel  technique  (Fig.  4c).  Compared  to  mini-emulsion  poly-
merization, the in situ sol-gel process is an economical and convenient
one-pot synthesis method that can be effortlessly expanded in a batch
reactor operating discontinuously. In another research work, Kalidasan
et al. [77] developed nanocomposite PCM by dispersing coconut shell
nanomaterial with PEG via direct mixing and ultrasonication process, as
in Fig. 4d. The developed nanocomposite sample ensured easy prepa-
ration and proper nanomaterial dispersion within the PCM matrix. The
synthesis technique varies based on the type of nanocomposite PCM that
is intended to be prepared. However, these techniques are really on a
research  scale,  and  hinder
large  scale
commercialization.

2.2. Impregnation techniques

Despite  the  widespread  interest  in  microencapsulation,  direct
impregnation  is  regarded  as  the  simplest  and  most  economical  incor-
poration  method.  This  method  entails  incorporating  PCM  in  either
powder or liquid form into the paste of a porous material. The vacuum
impregnation technique extracts the water and air in the porous mate-
rials  or  aggregates before  the  liquid  PCM  is  introduced  and  absorbed
through capillarity. In their research experiment, Dong et al. [78] used
vacuum  impregnation  techniques  for  nanocomposite  preparation.

enhancing thermal conductivity. A vacuum-oven was utilized to smooth
the  temperature  for  the  prepared  samples.  Vacuum  impregnation  en-
hances the penetration of nanoparticles into the PCM matrix, resulting in
a more even dispersion compared to traditional methods. The vacuum
environment  enables  accurate  regulation  of  the  quantity  of  nano-
particles infused into the PCM, allowing for customization of thermal
properties to meet specific needs. This scalable technique can be easily
implemented for mass production, making it well-suited for industrial
applications.

Additionally,  it  ensures  good  reproducibility,  guaranteeing  consis-
tency in the properties of the resulting nanocomposites. He et al. [79]
prepared composite PCM using a melt blend technique, as GNPs were
dispersed in ethyl alcohol using ultrasonication. The ultrasonication was
done for half an hour, and stirring was done within the same period. The
ultrasonication process facilitates the even distribution of nanoparticles
within the PCM matrix by producing cavitation bubbles. These bubbles
collapse  and  generate  localized  agitation,  aiding  in  the  breakup  and
dispersion of particles. The strong mechanical forces generated during
ultrasonication promote close contact between the nanoparticles and the
PCM,  resulting  in  improved  interfacial  bonding  and  efficient  heat
transfer  between  phases.  Ultrasonication  is  a  versatile  technique  that
can  be  applied  in  both  laboratory-scale  and  industrial  production  of
nanoparticle dispersed PCMs.

Adopting the impregnation technique, Alzoubi et al. [80] developed
a  cementitious  matrix  with  n-octadecane  (core  material),  methyl
methacrylate (monomer used as shell), which was diluted using ethanol
in  addition  to  cellulose  nanofiber  (extracted  from  wheat  straw).  The
impregnation  technique  facilitates  for  a  homogeneous  distribution  of
nano  PCMs  and  cellulose  nano  fiber  within  the  cementitious  matrix,
potentially leading to enhanced performance in terms of thermal regu-
lation  and  mechanical  integrity.  The  developed  cementitious  matrix
displays  that  incorporating  small  volume  of  (1  %)  of  any  renewable
organic natural cellulose fiber effectively enhances concrete’s rigidity
and tensile strength with improved cement mortar thermal properties. Li
et  al.  [81]  used  a  melting-impregnation  method  to  make  composite
PCM. The copper foam was washed and cut by ultrasonic cleaner. The
PCM, which had dry copper foam, was kept in deformable silicone and
heated at 80
C. The resulting composite PCM showed better thermal
conductivity with good dispersion of NPs. Achieving a uniform disper-
sion throughout the matrix is facilitated by melting the PCM and thor-
oughly  mixing  it  with  nanoparticles.  The  melting-impregnation
technique  offers  a  relatively  simple  approach  compared  to  other
methods, involving fewer steps and equipment, which makes it highly
suitable  for  large-scale  production.  This  technique  allows  for  precise
control over the infusion of nanoparticles into the PCM, enabling cus-
tomization of thermal properties and performance. However, challenges
related  to  nanoparticle  agglomeration,  non-uniform  dispersion,  and
compatibility between the PCM and nanoparticles may arise despite its
simplicity. Table 2 shows the overview of recent literature for nano PCM
preparation using impregnation methods.

2.3. Characterization techniques

Phase  change  materials  are  the  materials  that  change  their  phase
from solid to liquid with the application of specific heating value and
vice  versa.  Thousands  of  PCMs  are  available,  and  they  are  basically
categorized  as  organic,  inorganic,  and  eutectic  PCMs.  The  most
researched category of PCMs is organic PCMs like paraffins [86]. The
thermal performance of PCMs is largely dependent on phase transition
temperature and enthalpy value. The PCMs can hold high heat values,
particularly  PCMs  of  high  melting  point  temperatures.  But,  the  heat
transport  capacity  of  PCMs  is  lower,  which  hinders  the  usefulness  of
PCMs, and they absorb heat slowly and also reject heat slowly, that’s
why  they  have  not  been  used  practically  but  are  a  hot  topic  of  the
research  community.  So  nano  PCMs  have  been  prepared  by  various
authors  and  it  has been  characterized  to measure  the thermophysical

properties and some of the major techniques for the characterization of

Section 2 summarizes the various preparation techniques and char-
acterization of nano-enhanced phase change materials. In the literature,
authors investigated one-step, two-step, and three-step methods as well
as impregnation techniques to prepare nano PCM. Although these steps
are  widely  used  in  the  literature,  there  are  still  limitations  to  these
preparation methods, such as stability, particle size, and time for prep-
aration. Optimum particles should be considered when preparing nano
PCM. Moreover, the dispersion of NPs in base PCM should be optimized
to obtain stable nano PCM. The authors need to explore these parame-
ters more in future studies. The problem of the stability of NPs should be
more focused in future studies by researchers. Moreover, more charac-
terization techniques should be explored by authors in order to test the
properties of nano PCM better.

3. Nano materials dispersed with phase change material

The most desirable properties of nanomaterials are determined based
on  their  size,  shape,  and  structure;  subsequently,  numerous  nano  ar-
chitectonics  are  implicated  in  nanomaterials’  design  and  synthesis
techniques with a desire to achieve the nano size. As highlighted, the
features  of  nanomaterials  are  influenced  based  on  the  dimensions.
"Nanomaterial” encompasses any material with at least one dimension
inside  the  nanoscale  range,  which  is  generally  defined  as  1–100  nm.
Nanoparticles, nanofibers, nanotubes, and thin films are a few examples
of the diverse structures that might be categorized as nanomaterials. A
“nanoparticle” is a minuscule particle whose size falls into the nano-
scale range. These particles are usually spherical or nearly spherical in
shape  and  can  be  made  of  various  materials,  including  metals,  metal
oxides,  or  polymers.  Because  of  their  small  size,  nanoparticles  offer
special qualities like a high surface area to volume ratio and quantum
effects, making them useful in various fields like electronics, catalysis,

and medicine. Incorporating nanoparticles into PCMs represents a sig-
nificant advancement in the field of thermal energy storage, providing
nuanced  solutions  to  fundamental  PCM  limitations  such  as  limited
thermal conductivity and phase separation. The dimensional properties
of  nanoparticles  ranging  from  0D  entities  to  complex  3D  structures
determine the extent and nature of their impact on PCM performance.
This  section  digs  into  a  detailed  investigation  of  these  consequences,
addressing the gap indicated in the introductory review.

For 1D and 2D nanomaterials, band gap energy varies in its optical
and  electronic  properties.  The  discrete  character  of  the  energy  levels
arises as the system size approaches the de Broglie wavelength of the
electron. As a result, many nanomaterials have been developed and used
in  many  scientific  and  technological  applications.  Nanoparticles  of
carbon  elements  are  superior  to  metal  elements  for  thermal  energy
storage with PCMs. Metal nanoparticles are denser and have the possi-
bility  to  settle  down,  causing  non  uniform  dispersion.  Metal  nano-
particles also increase the overall weight of the nanocomposite that is
developed.  Furthermore,  existing  research  shows  that  not  all  metal
nanoparticles are compatible with PCM to enhance their thermal fea-
tures. The various NPs have been dispersed in base PCM, which are 0-D,
1-D, 2-D, and 3-D, as depicted in Fig. 5, and will be discussed in detail in
further subsections.

3.1. Zero dimensional (0D) nanoparticle enhanced PCM

0D nanoparticles, like nano-spheres or quantum dots, improve the
thermal  conductivity  of  PCMs  by  scattering  electrons  and  phonons.
Their spherical design enables more uniform dispersion inside the PCM
matrix, reducing heat resistance at the PCM-nanoparticle contact. This
direct interface increase considerably improves thermal energy storage
and release rates, making

0D-enhanced PCMs ideal for quick thermal applications. 0D-nano-
particles include ultrafine particles of nanometer scale that are larger
than atomic clusters and have sizes within 100 nm. The metal and its
oxide nanoparticles, such as Cu, Fe, Ag, Al2O3, TiO2, and ZnO.

The investigation carried out by Rufuss DDW et al. [95] focused on
applying  titania  and  copper  oxide  nanoparticles  (NPs)  in  paraffin  to
develop NePCM. The primary aim of the experiments was to enhance

water  productivity  in  the  developed  solar  still.  The  findings  demon-
strated  a  25  %  increase  in  the  value  of  k  when  3  %  of  titania  was
introduced to the base PCM, while using copper oxide NPs resulted in a
value  of  28.8  %.  Additionally,  the  inclusion  of  NPs  led  to  a  notable
improvement in system efficiency, with an increase of approximately 35
% compared to the use of solely the base PCM. The research conducted
by Sharma et al. [96] involved the preparation of nano PCM by blending
copper oxide (60 nm size) in paraffin with a phase transition tempera-
ture of 38–43
C. They proposed a unique passive cooling solution for
building integrated concentrated photovoltaic systems, which included
micro-fins  and  NePCM.  The  combined  effect  of  fins  and  PCM  was
investigated  using  a  3D  printed  PCM  containment.  3D  printing  was
utilized to prevent leakage issues, develop lightweight structures, reduce
manufacturing  time,  and  enhance  scalability  for  commercial  applica-
tions. Agglomeration within the nano-PCM was minimized by employ-
ing  an  ultrasonic  vibrator.  The  use  of  PCM  resulted  in  a  significant
enhancement in heat transfer for all configurations, with heat transfer
coefficient improvements of up to 35 % observed when PCM replaced
air.

Furthermore, the combination of PCM and micro-fins demonstrated
a high fin effectiveness of 1.32. In another work, a sonication technique
was  employed  by  Martin  et  al.  [97]  to  synthesize  SiO2  nanomaterial
dispersed binary eutectic PCM of capric-myristic acid using probe son-
ication. The thermal conductivity k increased by 142 % with 1.5 % SiO2
in  capric-myristic  acid  eutectic  composite.  The  resulting  NePCM
exhibited  thermal  stability  and  long-lasting  performance.  The  study’s
outcomes  revealed a direct relationship  between the concentration  of
nanoparticles and thermal conductivity, indicating that a higher nano-
particle content results in increased thermal conductivity. This can be
explained  by  considering  factors  such  as  Brownian  motion,  phonon
interaction,  clustering  of  nanoparticles,  and  the  effects  of  surface
morphology.  It  is  important  to  note  that  thermal  conductivity  mea-
surement was not conducted under solid-state conditions. However, this
property  is  anticipated  to  decrease  as  the  temperature  increases.  Sig-
nificant  improvements  in  thermal  conductivity  and  photo-thermal
conversion  of  lauric  acid-based  PCM  were  observed  when  carbon
black nanoparticles were added [98]. Additionally, the inclusion of 25
wt% calcium carbonate powder in the PCM prevented material leakage
during the solid-liquid phase transition, resulting in a form-stable PCM
with  superior  thermal  and  mechanical  properties.  The  thermal  con-
ductivity of the PCM increased by approximately 195 % when loaded
with 3.5 wt% carbon black nano-inclusions can be attributed to forming
interconnected percolation networks during solidification. The volume
filling  capability  and  compressibility  of  carbon  black  nano-inclusions
enhanced thermal conductivity in the solid state.

In  order  to  address the  issue  of  PCM  leakage  in  a  liquid  state,  re-
searchers have explored the use of solid-solid transition PCMs for ther-
mal  systems.  An  experimental  study  investigated  the  impact  of  CuO
nano additives on the solid-solid transition enthalpy of neopentyl glycol
PCM [99]. Solid-solid PCMs undergo a phase transition that involves the
absorption and release of significant heat, primarily due to the presence
of  metastable  hydrogen  bonds  in  their  crystal  structure.  By  incorpo-
rating  3  wt%  of  CuO  nanomaterial,  the  thermal  conductivity  of  neo-
pentyl  glycol  increased  from  0.12  W/(m⋅K)  to  0.61  W/(m⋅K).  This
improvement  in  conductivity  can  be  attributed  to  the  thermally
conductive nature of CuO nanoparticles, which create a network path
for  phonons  with  reduced  resistance,  resulting  in  enhanced  thermal
conductivity. To address the issue of leakage, a form-stable composite
PCM was prepared by impregnating a ternary eutectic mixture of capric
acid, palmitic acid, and stearic acid into nano-SiO2 in another research
endeavor [100]. Incorporating PCMs directly into porous materials to
create form-stable composite PCMs has proven to be an efficient solu-
tion.  The  porous  matrix  materials  aid  in  preventing  PCM  leakage  by
utilizing capillary and surface tension forces. This nano PCM combina-
tion  helped  better  store  solar  radiations  and  reduced  heat  loss  from
buildings.  Experimental  analysis  showed  that  Cu  nanomaterial

dispersed with paraffin (PCM) exhibited good dispersion of suspended
Cu  nanoparticles within  the nano  Cu-PCM composite, promoting effi-
cient  heat  transfer  to  the  lower  layers  [101].  Enhanced  dispersion  of
suspended  nanoparticles accelerates  heat transfer  from  the top  to the
bottom  of  the  nanocomposite.  However,  a  high  ratio  of  added  nano-
particles with poor dispersion can compromise the thermal conductivity
and  thermal  diffusivity,  resulting  in  a  reduced  heat  transfer  rate.
Therefore,  longer  ultrasonication  hours  are  recommended  to  enhance
nanoparticle dispersion within the nano Cu-PCM, increasing the colli-
sion frequency between nanoparticles and PCM molecules. This process
elevates the kinetic energy of nanoparticles and PCM atoms, reducing
agglomeration  and  enhancing  homogeneity,  thereby  modifying  the
physio-chemical  properties  of  the  nano  Cu-PCM.  PCM’s  energy  stor-
age/release  rate  is  heavily  reliant on  its  thermal  conductivity,  under-
scoring  the  need  to  enhance  its  thermal  conductivity  significantly.  A
study in the literature delved into the phase change behavior of newly
developed composites composed of palmitic acid and solid TiO2  nano-
particles for TES [102]. The thermal conductivity value k saw an 80 %
increase at 3 % nanoparticle weight, but agglomeration caused a sudden
decline in the nanocomposite’s thermal conductivity. The presence of
TiO2  nanoparticles altered the microstructure of the palmitic acid ma-
trix, resulting in improved phonon scattering and reduced phonon mean
free paths, thereby furthering thermal conductivity.

Through intimate contact and effective dispersion, nanoparticles can
act  as  efficient  heat  transfer  agents  within  the  PCM  matrix.  Incorpo-
rating 0D nanomaterials into organic PCMs is a promising approach to
enhance  thermal  efficiency  in  a  wide  range  of  applications,  such  as
thermal  energy  storage,  thermal  management  systems,  and  heat  ex-
changers. Research works from a few selective literatures on nano PCMs
preparation using 0D NPs are summarized in Table 4. To conclude, 0D
NPs enhanced the performance of base PCM but needed assistance to
disperse block materials for proper operation. Moreover, NPs that were
combined  with  1D  or  3D  nano  additives  significantly  enhanced  the
thermal conductivity of base PCM.

3.2. One-dimensional (1D) nanomaterial enhanced PCM

1D nanoparticles include nanorods, nanotubes, and nanofibers. 1D
materials include carbon nanotubes and 1D metal compound additives
as CuS, WS2, ZnO, and MoS2 [103]. 1D nanoparticles, such as nanotubes
and  nanofibers,  add  anisotropic  thermal  enhancement  properties  to
PCMs.  Their  elongated  structure  allows  for  the  creation  of  thermal
bridges inside the PCM, resulting in improved heat conduction pathways
along the nanoparticles’  length. This directional increase is especially
useful in applications that need precise heat transfer, such as thermal
management systems for electrical devices.

3.2.1. Nanowires, carbon fibers, carbon nano tubes and miscellaneous

This section of the review discusses the influence of 1D nanowires on
enhancing the thermophysical properties of organic PCM. Fin tubes have
been widely adopted in various configurations of heat storage systems to
enhance the thermal conductivity of PCM. Although this method effec-
tively improves the heat transfer rate, it comes with a high cost and is
limited  to  improving  the  heat  conduction  of  liquids.  Consequently,  a
novel approach was reported in this study, which involves the prepa-
ration  of  PCM  nanocomposites  using  MnO2  (Manganese  dioxide)
nanowires  and  nanotubes  [104].  These  nano  fillers  were  prepared
through a simple hydrothermal method and directly incorporated into
the organic PCM matrix without the need for complicated techniques.
The research investigated the impact of MnO2 nanotubes and nanowires
on paraffin wax, myristic acid, palmitic acid, and stearic acid. The re-
sults showed that MnO2  nanotubes significantly enhanced the thermal
conductivity of paraffin by 240.67 %, while MnO2 nanowires increased
the  thermal conductance of palmitic acid  by 377.16 %.  This suggests
that MnO2 nanowires and nanotubes can enhance the thermal conduc-
tivities  of  n-carboxylic  acids.  Furthermore,  the  PCM  nanocomposites

resulting in a decrease in the onset melting temperature.

Recent research has focused on clay minerals based foam stable PCM
as a solution to the problem of PCM leakage. These clay minerals possess
a unique porous structure and a specific surface area, enabling them to
effectively encapsulate a large amount of PCMs through capillary force
and surface tension. This encapsulation not only maintains the structural
strength of the foam, but also successfully addresses the issue of PCMs’
poor  flowability.  Several  clay  mineral-based  foam  stable  PCMs,
including expanded vermiculite (EVM), expanded perlite, kaolin, diat-
omite, and sepiolite, have been reported in the literature. In an attempt
to further enhance the performance of foam stable PCM, a mixture of 1D
silicon carbide nanowires and expanded vermiculite was used to wrap
PEG. This process resulted in the formation of a highly porous micro-
structure, with the lamellae of EVM tightly stacked together, providing
ample space for encapsulating PEG. By incorporating 3.29 wt% silicon
carbide nanowires, the thermal conductivity of PEG increased from 0.27
W/(m⋅K) to 0.533 W/(m⋅K). One primary cause of the deterioration of
PCM-composites is settling the filler in the liquid PCM during thermal
cycling.  The  thermal  enhancement  of  numerous  PCM  composites
weakens considerably after a few thermal cycles, highlighting the ne-
cessity for shape stabilization. To achieve shape stabilization in a PCM,
two strategies can be employed. The first involves incorporating a sub-
stantial amount of nano fillers into the PCM.

In contrast, the second entails creating an aerogel, which is a self-
existing and free-standing network of nano fillers, and then infiltrating
it  with  the  PCM.  Shape  stabilization  is  considered  highly  effective

among these two techniques as it only requires 5 wt% of nanomaterial
aerogel.  A  study  was  conducted  to  investigate  enhancing  paraffin’s
thermal  properties  and  structural  stability  by  incorporating  copper
nanowire aerogel. The study examines how including copper nanowire
aerogel in the material can efficiently enhance its ability to store and
release thermal energy [104]. Compared to pristine paraffin, the com-
posite’s  thermal  conductivity  increased  significantly  by  30  %.  The
nanowire aerogel improves heat transfer and maintains the material’s
structural integrity during repeated thermal cycling. The synthesis of a
hierarchical and anisotropic Ag nanowire fabric aerogel using ice tem-
plating  is  presented  in  this  study  [105].  The  purpose  of  this  aerogel
structure is to enhance the TES of PCM composites. The hierarchical and
anisotropic  Ag  nanowire  aerogel  fabrication  is  achieved  through  a
bidirectional freeze-casting technique, which greatly improves the per-
formance  and  reliability  of  PCMs.  The  study  results  indicate  that
incorporating  this  aerogel  into  the  composites  significantly  enhances
thermal  conductivity.  Furthermore,  the  composite  with  the  aerogel
demonstrates  excellent  thermal  stability  even  after  undergoing  100
thermal cycles, retaining approximately 94.3 % of its original thermal
conductivity. This research suggests that the synthesized aerogel shows
promise in enhancing the performance of PCM.

Carbon  fibers  have  high  performance  in  terms  of  the  k  value  of
around 1000 W/(m⋅K) due to crystalline structure [106]. Furthermore,
carbon fiber, which consists of carbon atoms arranged in a crystalline
structure,  demonstrates  impressive  tensile  strength,  lightweight  prop-
erties, and remarkable stiffness. The phenolic resin carbon foam modi-
fied by MWCNTs led to an enhancement in the thermal performance of
PEG PCM [107]. PEG was enclosed within the carbon foam/MWCNTs
composite through a vacuum impregnation method. The modified car-
bon  foam,  characterized  by  inter-connected  porous  structures,  func-
tioned  as  an  effective  supporting  material  for  encapsulating  organic
PCMs. With the inclusion of 10 wt% of carbon foam, the thermal con-
ductivity of PEG saw a significant increase of 240 % compared to pure
PEG.  Acting  as  a  conduction  channel,  the  carbon  foam  improved  the
thermal conductivity of PCMs. MWCNTs, with their high aspect ratio,
excellent thermal properties, and large specific surface area, served as
crucial  thermal  conductive  fillers.  The  thermal  conductivity  of  the
composites was further enhanced by the addition of MWCNTs, creating a
secondary  heat  conduction  network  through  the  interweaving  of
MWCNTs. Using carbon materials in preparing phase change composites
shows great promise in improving the overall thermal conductivity of
PCM  [108].  Carbon  materials  are  particularly  effective  fillers  due  to
their high thermal conductivity and low density, requiring only a small
volume fraction. The connection state of the fillers primarily influences
the effective thermal conductivity of composite materials using fillers.
When  the  filler  connection  reaches  a  percolated  state,  the  effective
thermal conductivity experiences a significant increase, and the mini-
mum  amount  of  filler  required  to  achieve  this  state  is  known  as  the
percolating  threshold  value.  Therefore,  forming  an  efficient  filler
network is crucial in attaining the percolating threshold with minimal
filler  content.  The  research  conducted  by  Li  et  al.  [109]  involved
budding  carbon  nanofibers  on  flake  graphite  to  develop  a  hybrid
structured nanomaterial that enhances the thermal performance of PCM.
The  synthesis  process  involved  using  flake  graphite  as  a  matrix  for
growing  carbon  nanofibers  through  chemical  vapor  deposition  at
750
C. Later, carbon nanofibers was bonded with silane coupling re-
agent  modified  bentonite  to  create  a  mineral-coupled  supporting  ma-
terial with high thermal conductivity and loading space. To intuitively
detect the coupling behavior and synergistic improvement effect, a mass
ratio  of  1:10  of  bentonite  to  flake  graphite  was  specifically  chosen.
Stable  PCM  composites  were  meticulously  prepared  after  including
stearic  acid  (PCM).  The  primary  emphasis  of  this  study  lies  in  the
exploration of a mineral-coupled supporting material, namely the flake
graphite-carbon  nanofiber-modified  bentonite  material,  through  the
establishment of a strong chemical bond between carbon nanofiber and
bentonite  as  opposed  to  mere  physical  interaction.  This  approach

facilitates the establishment of a strong chemical bond between carbon
nanofiber  and  bentonite  instead  of  mere  physical  interaction.  It  en-
hances thermal conductivity, loading capacity, and overall thermal ef-
ficiency in forming stable PCM composites. The increasing demand for
PCM  highlights  the  importance  of  guaranteeing  the  longevity  of  the
newly  created  nanocomposite.  Therefore,  a  mixture  of  epoxy,  carbon
nanofiber, and paraffin wax was utilized to fabricate laminates using a
well-balanced plain-weave carbon fiber fabric [110]. Upon analysis of
the  results,  it  was  observed  that  the  epoxy/carbon  nanofiber/wax
nanocomposite enhanced the thermal conductivity to 0.7 W/(m⋅K) due
to the inclusion of carbon nanofiber as a stabilizing element. Utilizing
vertically  aligned  carbon  fibers  as  supporting  scaffolds,  thermally
conductive and shape-stabilized PCM nanocomposites were successfully
prepared [111]. The aligned and hollow carbon fiber scaffolds, featuring
different densities, were conveniently fabricated by directly carbonizing
rolled  cotton sheets containing  aligned  and  hollow cellulose fibers.  A
shape stabilized PCM nanocomposite was then developed through vac-
uum  impregnation  of  paraffin  wax.  The  presence  of  interconnected
hollow carbon fiber frameworks with vertically aligned fibers and high
porosity in the Shape stabilized PCM nanocomposite leads to enhanced
anisotropic  thermal  conductivity  and  excellent  shape  stability,  pre-
venting any leakage. Thermal conductivity is found to be higher in the
axial  direction  along  the  fibers  than  in  the  lateral  direction,  as  the
aligned fiber scaffolds act as the pathway for thermal conduction. For a
shape stabilized PCM nanocomposite with a carbon ratio of 8.8 wt%, the
thermal  conductivity  was  measured  to  be  0.77  W/(m⋅K)  in  the  axial
direction, while it was 0.58 W/(m⋅K) in the lateral direction. Using the
slurry molding technique, carbon bonded carbon fiber monoliths were
successfully  prepared  and  subsequently  impregnated  with  paraffin
composite  using  the  vacuum  impregnation  method  [112].  The  incor-
poration of carbon fibers, renowned for their exceptional conductivity,
established highly effective thermal conduction paths within the carbon
bonded carbon fibers monoliths. Consequently, the thermal conductivity
of the PCM composites witnessed a remarkable increase, ranging from
18 to 57 times. Furthermore, these carbon bonded carbon fibers based
PCM  composites  possess  the  advantages  of  being  lightweight  and
dimensionally stable. It is worth mentioning that most research works
do not exhibit such a significant improvement in the thermal properties
of paraffin. However, it is crucial to ensure that the increase in thermal
conductivity remains within an acceptable range to ensure the efficient
utilization of TES.

CNTs,  like  other  non-metallic  materials,  are  believed  to  transport
thermal  energy  through  a  phonon  conduction  mechanism.  The  effi-
ciency  of  this  conduction  in  nanotubes  is  affected  by  various  factors,
including the number of phonon active modes, surface scattering at the
boundaries, and the length of the phonons free path. The thermal con-
ductivity of CNTs is determined by factors such as atomic arrangement,
tube  diameter  and  length,  structural  defects,  morphology,  and  the
presence of impurities. CNTs include single wall carbon nanotubes and
multi walled carbon nanotubes having a high value of k as 2000–3000
W/(m⋅K)  [113].  Erythritol-based  composites  were  developed  using
various weight fractions of CNT nanomaterial (1, 3, 5, and 7 wt%) [114].
CNTs with higher weight fractions encounter more excellent interfacial
thermal resistance among the tubes because of their significantly larger
specific surface area. As a result, the thermal conductivity enhancement
effect diminishes with increasing additive content, particularly above 3
wt% for CNT composites. The leakage issue of liquid phase PCM during
phase transition can be resolved using a suitable sealing/packing unit.
Nevertheless,  it  is  important  to  note  that  the  packaging  unit  may
significantly  increase  the  overall  cost  and  a  reduction  in  thermal
conductance between the working system and PCM. Therefore, porous
and lightweight construction materials are highly recommended for the
encapsulation of PCM. The matrix type mentioned facilitates the effec-
tive impregnation of paraffins in precise quantities, ensuring no leakage
occurs during the heating treatments. In order to address this concern, n-
eicosane was used as a PCM and impregnated into the porous structure

of  expanded  perlite  [115].  Subsequently,  CNTs  were  dispersed  to
enhance the thermal conductivity of the composite material, increasing
it from 0.05 W/(m⋅K) to 0.32 W/(m⋅K). This improvement in thermal
conductance can be attributed to the reduction of void space within the
composite PCM and the expansion of the contact surface area for the
composite  particles.  The  stearic  acid/CNTs  composite  prepared  by  Li
et  al.  [116]  was  utilized  to  create  nano  PCM,  with  the  resulting
enhancement  value  of  thermal  conductivity  being  measured.  The
increased molecular interaction between CNTs and stearic acid boosted
the thermal conductivity value, recorded at 1.02 W/(m⋅K). A novel set of
nanocomposites,  comprising  single-walled  CNTs  and  PEG,  was
custom-made through an easy impregnation method to simultaneously
stabilize the shape and enhance the heat transfer efficiency of a typical
PEG based PCM [117]. The enhancement in thermal conductivity varies
significantly based on the different loadings of CNTs and the states of
PEG during the solid-liquid phase change process. The quantity of single
walled CNTs has a notable impact on the thermal conductivity of the
composite PCMs, with the thermal conductivity of the nanocomposite
steadily increasing [ranging from 0.24 W/(m⋅K) to 3.43 W/(m⋅K)] with
the increase in single-walled CNTs. The research conducted by Cao et al.
[118] involved the preparation of NePCM by functionalizing SWCNTs
and MWCNTs with hexadecylacrylate. The thermal conductivity values
for  SWCNTs  and  MWCNTs  were  0.47  W/(m⋅K)  and  0.88  W/(m⋅K),
respectively, which were 134 % and 339 % higher than the base PCM.
This  indicates  that  adding  nanoparticles  significantly  enhanced  the
thermal performance of the base PCM. The above studies concluded that
adding NPs concentrations in base PCM enhanced the thermal perfor-
mance  of  base  PCM  as  NPs  have  some  value  of  k  which  aided  in
enhancing heat transfer phenomena and proving better thermal results.
Two commonly used methods to enhance the thermal properties of
PCM  include  adding  nanoparticles  and/or  metal  foam.  While  higher
nanoparticle concentrations can improve thermal properties, they may
decrease the stability of the composite. Metal foams can also boost heat
transfer  properties  by  increasing  thermal  conductivity,  but  the  effec-
tiveness depends on the porosity level, which must be optimized based
on  PCM  specifications  [119].  Comparison  was  made  between  heat
transfer  enhancement  of  PCM  during  melting  and  solidification  pro-
cesses, utilizing nanoparticles and metal foam in addition to pure PCM.
RT44HC was chosen as the PCM, with CuO nanoparticles and Cu metal
foam [120]. The addition of nanoparticles slightly increased the thermal
conductivity  of  the  PCM,
improved  heat  transfer
performance.

leading  to

Conversely,  metal  foams  significantly  increased  the  heat  transfer
area, serving as the primary mechanism for enhancing the heat transfer
rate. Metal foams are highly thermally conductive, distributing thermal
energy  throughout  their  bodies.  Settlement  of  nanoparticles  and  for-
mation of hollows inside the PCM are practical issues associated with
nanoparticle use. The thermal behavior of nano encapsulated PCM, in
conjunction with copper metal foam within a plexiglass chamber, was
explored by Li et al. [121]. The study focused on the nano-encapsulated
PCM,  comprising  an  octadecane  core  and  shape  stabilized  by  poly-
styrene

enhanced  the  thermal  conductivity  of  PCM  along  the  fiber  direction.
Although CNTs can be used directly to improve thermal conductivity,
they are often mixed with other dimensional additives to obtain better
results.  The  one-dimensional  nano  additives  having  lower  concentra-
tions are more convenient in forming heat transport inter-additive net-
works,  resulting  in  an  increment  of  the  value  of  k  in  the  base  PCM.

for higher thermal conductivity along the fiber axis than copper, their

use in PCM has been limited to free and randomly dispersed systems.
Issues  such  as  poor  dispersion  causing  inhomogeneity  and  instability
during  charge-discharge  cycles  have  posed obstacles  to implementing
carbon fibers in practical applications.

3.3. Two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterial enhanced PCM

2D  nanomaterials  include  graphene  and  its  derivatives,  MXene,
molybdenum  disulfide  (MoS2)  and  hexagonal  boron  nitride  (h-BN)
[122].  Graphene  and  its  derivatives  provide  a  large  surface  area  for
interaction with PCM molecules, resulting in significant gains in heat
conductivity. The broad interface offered by 2D nanoparticles breaks the
PCM’s crystalline structure less than smaller-dimensional nanoparticles,
conserving more latent heat storage capacity while improving thermal
transport.

3.3.1. Graphene, boron nitride, MXene and miscellaneous

Recently,  researchers  have  made  advancements  in  enhancing  the
light-absorption  characteristics  of  materials  by  incorporating  light-
absorbing  elements  such  as  metal  or  metal  oxides,  carbon  materials,
and dyes. Notably, carbon nanomaterials can absorb light across the full
spectrum and possess a wide range of spectral capabilities. Even though
CNTs  possess  a  broad  absorption  band  for  photo-thermal  conversion,
their light absorption coefficient in the visible light range is insufficient.
On the other hand, monolayer graphene exhibits a 2D plane structure
characterized by a hexagonal lattice, resulting from the hybridization of
carbon atoms in the sp2  configuration. Merely 0.335 nm thick, mono-
layer  graphene  is  approximately  1/200,000  of  the  diameter  of  hair
strands.  Graphene  is  recognized  as  the  thinnest  yet  toughest  nano-
material  globally  [123].  Its  exceptional  thermal  conductivity  of  5300
W/(m⋅K) surpasses that of CNTs and diamonds.

Moreover,  it  is  crucial  to  highlight  that  graphene  demonstrates  a
remarkable  capacity  to  effectively  absorb  sunlight  within  the  visible
light range of 380–760 nm. As a result, graphene holds great promise in
enhancing  the  efficiency  of  solar  energy  utilization.  When  combined
with  composite  PCMs,  graphene  imparts  both  exceptional  thermal
conductivity and a heightened solar energy utilization ratio.

A form-stable composite PCM was developed within this context by
combining PEG and GO [124]. PEG served as the PCM for storing solar
energy, while GO was selected as the photo-thermal conversion material
for  absorbing  sunlight  in  the  UV–Vis  and  near  IR  range.  Through
ultrasound-assisted physical blending, the GO/PEG composite PCM was
synthesized.  The  samples  demonstrate  light  absorption  within  the
UV–visible range, with absorbance curves mirroring those of GO. As the
GO  content  increases,  the  absorbance  of  the  samples  gradually  rises.
Amidst,  renowned  for  its  lightweight  nature  and  inherent  flexibility,
graphene  boasts  remarkable  properties,  including  a  high  Young’s
modulus of 1100 GPa and an impressive ultimate strength of 116 GPa.
These exceptional attributes contribute to the broad range of applica-
tions  where  graphene  is  extensively  used.  GO  is  distinguished  by  the
existence of several oxygen-containing functional groups on its surface,
such as epoxy, carbonyl, and hydroxyl groups. These functional groups
are instrumental in fostering compatibility between GO and polymers.
An  innovative  design  concept  has  been  put  forward  for  cross-linked
polymeric  SSPCMs,  aiming  to  enhance  their  thermal  performance
[125].  This  concept  involves  using  PEG  as  the  soft  chain  and  phase
change functional units, 4,4′-diphenylmethan diisocyanate as a blocking
agent, and GO as a hard-molecular skeleton. Through the combination
of  hydrogen  bonding  and  electrostatic  interactions  among  functional
groups, this method forms a three-dimensional, interconnected frame-
work  within  polymeric  SSPCMs.  This  led  to  introducing  a  regular
lamellar structure of GO into the polymer’s molecular chains. The for-
mation of thermally conductive pathways within the interior PEG chains
was achieved, guaranteeing the efficient storage and release of thermal
energy during phase change procedures.

Consequently,  the  novel  shape  stabilized  PCMs  exhibited  a

remarkable thermal capacity and excellent thermal stability. Moreover,
the  three-dimensional  interconnected  structure  effectively  prevented
any  leakage  of  PEG  during  phase  change  processes.  New  generation
composite PCMs are anticipated to possess the capability to transform
various energies into thermal energy for storage, including converting
light to thermal energy and electric to thermal energy. The diverse en-
ergy  conversion  capabilities  significantly  broaden the  potential appli-
cations of PCMs across various fields. A hybrid aerogel was successfully
fabricated by employing commercial melamine foam (MF) as the sup-
porting framework and a GO/GNP composite aerogel as the conductive
path [126]. The remarkable capability of MF as a supporting substrate
was evident, as it formed a 3D interconnected network with other nano
fillers such as BN, GO, and MoS2. The k value of resulted composite was
1.46 W/(m⋅K) at a filler content of 4.89 wt%. This was 421 % higher
than  that  of  base  PCM.  Researchers  often  modify  the  porosity  and
wettability  of  porous  supporting  materials  in  their  research  works  to
optimize PCM loading and enhance thermal conductivity. These modi-
fications  are  carried  out  using  physical  or  chemical  techniques.
Considering this, the exploitation of fatty amines (FAs) as organic PCMs
in the development of FSPCM composites with high energy density was
discussed, utilizing a porous 3D graphene sponge (GS) as the supporting
material [127].  The k value of tetradecylamine/graphene sponge and
octadecylamine/graphene  sponge  nano  PCM  was  0.36  W/(m⋅K)  and
0.50 W/(m⋅K), respectively. This was 144 % and 164 % higher compared
to  base  PCM.  From  the  research  studies  discussed  above,  it  can  be
concluded that adding 2D NPs in base PCM have a more positive effect in
the enhancement of thermal performance. A few other research woks on
nano PCMs preparation using 2D GNPs is summarized in Table 4.

The strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions between
PEG and GO make the latter a highly promising material for fabricating
PEG  based  shape-stabilized  PCMs,  distinguishing  it  from  other  sup-
porting  materials  [128].  A  lesser  amount  of  GO  is  needed  to  reach  a
remarkable shape-stabilized effect. This, in turn, contributes to a rela-
tively higher energy storage density for PCMs as the supporting mate-
rials replace a smaller portion of the working substance. GO and BN are
incorporated into PEG as support materials and thermally conductive
fillers in order to enhance shape stability and thermal conductivity. This
nanocomposite was developed by the inclusion of 30 wt% boron nitride
in polyethylene glycol using facile solution blending. With 4 wt% GO
and  30  wt%  BN,  the  PEG/BN/GO  composite  PCM  has  achieved  a
remarkable  thermal  conductivity  of  3.00  W/(m⋅K),  surpassing  that  of
pure PEG by tenfold. The presence of a hybrid network structure of GO
and BN in the matrix has substantially enhanced the shape-stability of
the composite PCM, ensuring its structural integrity under compression
by a constant normal force of 5 N at 120
C. MXene has been widely
utilized in various fields, including hydrogen storage, electronic devices,
water purification, and thermal energy storage, owing to its exceptional
physicochemical  characteristics.  These  properties  encompass  remark-
able  hardness,  hydrophilicity,  excellent  oxidation  resistance,  high
thermal and electrical conductivity, exceptional thermal stability, and a
large surface area. For the first time MXene was dispersed with organic
PCM  (paraffin)  to  improve  its  thermo-physical  properties  [129].  The
intermolecular  interactions  between  atoms  in  surface  area  of  MXene
nanoparticles and C–H bonds of the organic PCM causes to enhance the
light-to-heat energy conversion; however, the increase in thermal con-
ductivity is not predominant.

◦

Additionally,  the  MXene  surface  possesses  a  high  specific  surface
area and abundant hydrophilic groups. This characteristic is expected to
generate a robust adsorption force and facilitate hydrogen bonding in-
teractions with the water-soluble PEG molecular chains. The develop-
ment of form stable PCM is made more convenient by employing the
PEG/MXene  composite,  which  was  prepared  using  a  simple  vacuum
impregnation technique. The impact of MXene on the form-stable per-
formance,  thermal  properties,  crystallization  behaviour,  thermal  con-
ductivity,  electrical  conductivity,  and  light-to-thermal  and  electro-to-
thermal  energy  conversion  and  storage  behaviour  of  the  obtained

PEG/MXene FSPCMs was systematically investigated [56]. The thermal
conductivity  of  pure  PEG  is  predictably  low,  measuring  at  0.285
W/(m⋅K). However, the thermal conductivity of PEG@MXene exhibits a
significant improvement, reaching 2.052 W/(m⋅K), which is 7.2 times
higher than that of pure PEG. This notable enhancement can be attrib-
uted to the excellent heat transfer facilitated by the interconnected Ti3C2
MXene structure, which serves as the structural backbone for PEG@M-
Xene. The enhancement in value of k by adding 2D NPs in base PCM was
more as compared to 0D and 1D NPs due to effect of more bonding and
dispersion of NPs in base PCM which ultimately increased the thermal
performance more effectively.

TES and thermal control systems mostly utilize PCMs because they
have high thermal energy storage capacity and melting points. However,
the  main  flaw  of  PCMs  is  their  low  thermal  conductivity,  and  efforts
have  been  made  to  improve  their  thermal  performance.  Several  re-
searchers have investigated the improvement of PCMs by using different
schemes  and  miscellaneous  NPs  to  improve  performance.  The  assess-
ment of thermal energy storage and heat dissipating characteristics was
carried out by Guo et al. [130] on the PCM with fin metal foam hybrid
assembly. Results showed that the usage of fin metal foams in TES unit
lowered the melting time by 83.35 %; enhanced transient temperature
response by 529.1 % and improved the temperature uniformity in TES
compared to the baseline case. To conclude, 2D nano additives proofed
as building blocks for the assembly of 2D structures, and 2D nano ad-
ditives  showed  maximum  thermal  conductivity  enhancement  of  PCM
due  to  the  construction  of  phonon  pathways.  Two-dimensional  mate-
rials, including GO, rGO, and h-BN exhibited best thermal performance
and are broadly studied for thermal management systems.

Moreover, these materials have an edge of being atomically thin and
mechanically flexible. Hence, adding 2D materials is promised material
to solve PCM’s intrinsic low thermal conductivity problems potentially.
The creation of phonon pathways and growth of large domains of two
dimensional materials result from achieving maximum value of k in base
PCM.

3.4. Three-dimensional (3D) nanomaterial enhanced PCM

Three  dimensional  nanomaterials  include  3D  carbon  materials,
Metal-organic  frameworks  (MOFs)  and  its  derivatives,  and  other  3D
nanomaterials; aerogels create a porous network within phase change
materials  (PCMs).  This  network  improves  thermal  conductivity  and
diffusivity by boosting convective heat transport throughout the PCM
matrix.  The  distinctive  morphology  of  3D  nanoparticles  also  helps  to
reduce  phase  separation  and  improve  the  chemical  stability  of  PCMs
during heat cycling. Expanded graphite (EG) has also garnered consid-
erable attention within carbon-based materials due to its affordability
and unique structure. This structure results from the intercalated ma-
terial’s  thermal  decomposition,  leading  to  the  axial  expansion  of
graphite. EG can be seen as an intermediate state between graphite and
graphene, resembling a worm-like structure [131].

3.4.1. 3D carbon materials, metal organic frameworks, and miscellaneous
The 3D carbon material possesses a continuous 3D network and pore
structure, which leads to an augmented contact area with PCM, hence
enhancing the thermal conductivity of PCM. The two 3D carbon material
addition categories are porous carbon and carbon foam. Increasing the
carbonization temperature enhances the value of k for porous carbon.
Mesoporous carbons were easily prepared through carbonization, taking
advantage of their porous structure, high porosity, large specific surface
areas, and a certain level of graphitization. These mesoporous carbons
were  chosen  as  the  supporting  material  for  loading  paraffin  [132].
Leakage tests showed that the resulting nano composite PCM had a high
paraffin  loading  capacity.  Highly  porous  carbons  can  be  effectively
synthesized by employing a controlled carbonization technique on MOF.
During this process, the migration and aggregation of small ZnO parti-
cles  within  the  carbon  matrix  give  rise  to  the  formation  of  new

micropores and mesoporous channels.

Furthermore, the evaporation of ZnO particles leads to the creation
of larger nano cavities [133]. As a result, the developed porous carbon
exhibits an impressive absorption capacity, with up to 92.5 wt% of PEG
being  absorbed  within  its  pore  volume.  The  high  storage  capacity  of
paraffin  molecules  is  ensured  by  the  nano  cavities  in  the  composites,
which  have  a  large  mesopore  volume.  Moreover,  the  presence  of  mi-
cropores and mesoporous channels induces surface tension and capillary
force, thereby enhancing the thermal stability of the composites.

By  employing  a  cost-effective  polyurethane  foam  templating  tech-
nique, a porous and lightweight carbon foam was successfully synthe-
sized  using  phenolic  resin.  This  carbon  foam  proved  to  be  an  ideal
support material for PEG thermal storage material [134]. The resulting
PEG/carbon  foam  composite  exhibited  an  impressive  energy-storage
density,  as indicated  by  its melting  enthalpy  of 135.7 J/g.  Moreover,
the  thermal  conductivity  of  the  composite  was  enhanced  by  109.8  %
compared to pure PEG. PEG’s low thermal conductivity and poor shape
stability limit its practical applications.

Consequently, there is a need to enhance its thermophysical prop-
erties. To address this, a series of hydrothermal carbon/PEG composites
were  created  by  physically  blending  hydrothermal  carbon  with  PEG
[135]. By undergoing a functionalization process, the –OH and –COOH
groups  of  the  hydrothermal  carbon  were  bonded,  leading  to  an
augmented thermal network structure and enhanced thermal conduc-
tance. The instability of composite PCMs often arises when PCM load-
ings  are  high,  mainly  due  to  phase  separation  during  repeated
charge/discharge thermal cycles. Ensuring the critical uniform solidifi-
cation nucleation of the PCMs on the supports becomes imperative in
such  scenarios.  The  hydrophobicity  of  graphitic  carbons  is  a  widely
recognized characteristic that hinders uniform nucleation. As a result,
introducing heteroatoms onto carbonaceous surfaces has proven to be
an effective strategy for enhancing surface properties. In the interest, a
mesoporous  carbon  fiber  was  synthesized  with  continuous  graphitic
walls and in-situ fluorine doping to synthesis a form-stable PCM [91].
The  PCM  was  designed  to  accommodate  high  loading  of  PCMs  and
improve thermal conductivity. The primary element that contributes to
an  increase  in  the  k  values  of  the  composites  is  the  a)  formation  of
continuous thermal conductive networks by the graphitic walls of the
MCFs;  b)  fiber  supports  with  large  aspect  ratios  offer  more  extensive
heat transmission channels compared to powder additions.

MOFs  have  large  surface  area  and  volume,  which  are  suitable  for
encapsulation.  With  highly  controlled  pore  architectures  and  surface
chemical characteristics, metal ions or clusters combined with organic
ligands  form  MOFs,  which  are  crystalline  materials  [136].  Improved
optical, electrical, magnetic, and photocatalytic capabilities are signifi-
cant  by  MOFs’  unique  structure,  making  them  valuable  for  energy
conversion, storage, and transmission applications. MOF-porous carbon
materials offer a reassuring solution to the continuity challenge associ-
ated with the increasing need for multi-functionality in PCM. An inno-
vative 3D macro porous lamellar structure of MOF/EG composites has
been developed to demonstrate the distinct optical properties of MOF
and the organic-inorganic synergy that enhances PCM (paraffin) [137].
The composite material comprises MOFs carbon material composed of
EG, zeolitic imidazole framework, and paraffin for solar energy storage.
The  material’s  three-dimensional  macropore  lamellar  structure  en-
hances  its  photothermal  conversion  efficiency  by  95.6  %  and  phase
change capabilities for improving energy storage efficiency. This inno-
vation  holds  promise  for  diverse  applications  beyond  solar  energy
storage,  showcasing  the  potential  of  MOF-based  composites  in
advancing renewable energy technologies. Through the utilization of a
GO@MOF template, scientists have effectively synthesized a 3D reduced
graphene porous carbon support PCMs (stearic acid) [138]. This tech-
nique enables the concurrent realization of considerable phase change
enthalpy and elevated thermal conductivity.

The  effect  of  nanoparticles  on  PCMs  is  not  just  additive  but  also
depends on the interaction between nanoparticle dimensions and PCM

matrix  properties.  While  0D  and  1D  nanoparticles  primarily  improve
thermal conductivity via electron and phonon interactions, 2D and 3D
nanoparticles improve both conductivity and thermal storage capacity
by  modifying  the  PCMs’  microstructure.  This  comparative  research
emphasizes the need to select the right nanoparticle dimensionality for
the  individual  application  requirements  and  desired  thermal  perfor-
mance  outcomes.  Various  authors  used  different  NPs  with  different
materials  to  enhance the  performance  of  base  PCM.  Investigating the
impact of adding nanoparticles and porous copper metal foam in a triple
tube  system,  Li  et  al.  [139]  examined  the  enhancement  in  thermal
conductivity  of  (PCM  during  charging  and  discharging  processes.  Re-
sults showed that the melting/solidification time was reduced by 25.9
%,  28.2  %  using  5  wt%  nanoparticles  and  83.7  %,  88.2  %  for  95  %
porosity  metal  foam,  respectively,  compared  to  the  pure  PCM.  The
combined metal foam of 95 % porosity and nanoparticles of 5 wt% gave
2.7  %  and  4.7  %  melting  and  solidification  temperature  reduction,
respectively, compared to PCM metal foam case. The primary emphasis
in research is on incorporating copper foam into the entire PCM, while
there is a lack of comprehensive discussion on partially filling the copper
foam.  The  enhancement  mechanism  of  copper  foam  primarily  stems
from its ability to enhance overall heat conduction effectively. However,
the presence of copper foam inevitably occupies space within the PCM,
thereby decreasing the heat storage density of the LTES unit.

Consequently, selecting the appropriate filling ratio of copper foam
became  highly  significant.  This  was  not  only  to  fulfill  the  thermal
requirement  of  the  LTES  unit  but  also  to  optimize  the  heat  storage
density. Therefore, an analysis was carried out to investigate the influ-
ence of the volume fraction of copper foam on the thermal behavior of
PCM numerical simulation using a two-temperature model [140]. For
volume fractions of 4.78 % and 10 %, melting and solidification times
were shortened by 93.32 % and 97.63 %, respectively. Extensive anal-
ysis  reveals  that  nanoparticles  of  varying  dimensions  are  successfully
synthesized and dispersed in PCM, catering to a wide array of applica-
tions. The primary focus of research on 3D nanoparticles combined with
PCM has predominantly centered around expanded graphite, consisting
of  multiple sheets.  The  involvement  of  highly  reactive  nanoscale  sur-
faces  in  various  reactions  during  handling  and  their  tendency  to
agglomerate  are  often  undesirable.  Therefore,  carefully  selecting  the
nanostructure used as the filler candidate in PCM becomes crucial. Be-
sides  the  nanoscale  surface,  the  intricate  structure  of  nanostructures
could  have  a  crucial  influence  on  the  main  objective  of  the  ongoing
research. The primary emphasis is on incorporating 3D tetrapod nano-
crystals with complex shapes derived from zinc oxide (ZnO) materials as
potential  filler  options  in  PCM.  An  investigation  was  carried  out  on
tetrapod engineered organic PCM composite, which shows promise in
capturing thermal energy through its photonic energy absorption and
thermal  conductance  properties  [54].  With  its  3D  configuration,  this
shape  possesses  a  remarkable  advantage  by  incorporating  functional
ZnO properties while avoiding agglomeration in composites, regardless
of  the  handling  process.  The  expanding  arms  in  all  three  directions
enable the shape to disperse uniformly and homogeneously. Two types
of tetrapods namely thin arms (E type) and thick arms (P type) nano-
particles,  were  experimentally  investigated.  The  increase  in  thermal
conductivity was about 92.2 % and 94.4 % with 2.0 wt% of P and E type
tetrapods respectively.

In  conclusion,  although  MOFs  with  a  large  surface  area  and  large
thermal and chemical stability are very suitable for encapsulating PCMs,
their  inherently  low  thermal  conductivity  limits  the  thermal  conduc-
tivity of the resulting PCM. Therefore, MOFs usually require 1D CNTs or
2D  graphene  with  excellent  conductivity  to  build  a  3D  conductive
network to increase performance. Moreover, further investigations are
required  to  make  PCM  based  on  porous  carbon  fully  applicable  in
thermal management, where they act as spreaders for thermal conduc-
tion  in  electronic  devices.  High-temperature  carbon  material  helps  in
carbonization,  which  increases  base  PCM’s  thermal  performance.  To
sum  up,  three  dimensional  materials  having  a  continuous  three

dimensional network are best in creating more contact area in the base
PCM, which helps enhance the value of k in the base PCM along with
properties such as mechanical properties increment.

3.5. Hybrid nanoparticles enhanced PCM

Composite  nano  additives  containing  two  or  more  kinds  of  nano-
materials can be the same or different dimensions. Wang et al. [158]
compared the effects of 2D and 3D carbon based structure on the per-
formance of nano enhanced PCM. The value of nano-enhanced PCM has
a higher value of k when ethylene glycol was added to base PCM than
graphene nanoplatelets. The value of “k was improved by a factor of 22
at 20 wt% loading of ethylene glycol.

Qian  et  al.  [159]  prepared  3D  single  wall  carbon  nanotubes  and
graphene nanoplatelets  in poly ethylene glycol. The “k value  of com-
posite  PCM  was  improved  by  9.5-fold  compared  to  base  PCM.  The
structure of graphene nanoplatelets indicated more transfer of heat in
composite PCM. Xia et al. [160] examined the use of ultrasonic disper-
sion and vacuum drying to create form stable nanocomposites consisting
of PEG-8000, MWCNT, and h-BN. An increase of 239.7 % in the k value
was  found.  The  creation  of  a  thermally  conductive  network  in  the
composite was a result of the synergistic impact of h-BN and MWCNTs.
Su  et  al.  [161]  synthesized  a  hybrid  composite  by  incorporating
multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT), single-walled carbon nano-
tubes  (SWCNT),  and  graphene  oxide  (GO)  into  polyethylene  glycol
(PEG)  to  create  composites.  A  308  %  increase  in  the  value  of  the  k
enhancement was seen when 0.5 % was dispersed in PEG, attributed to
the  coupling  of  CNTs  with  GO.  Kalidasan  et  al.  [162]  reported  a  sig-
nificant increase of 25.7 % in k value when 0.5 % of cobalt nano fillers
and PANI were distributed in paraffin wax. This increase can be attrib-
uted to the enhanced creation of a thermal network. Zang et al. [90]
employed ultrasonication and vacuum drying to scatter Ag/GNS nano-
particles  in  PEG6000.  The  combined  impact  of  both  nanoparticles
significantly  increased  the  value  of  k  to  around  95.3  %  for  the  com-
posites  and  achieved  a  photothermal  conversion  efficiency  of  92  %.
Using self-assembly, Cao et al. [163] synthesized a composite aerogel
(graphene + CNT) through chemical reduction and freeze-drying. PEG
was  utilized  to  facilitate aerogel  formation  by  stacking  GO  and  CNTs
following chemical reduction. The value of k was improved, and a value
of 0.67 W/(m⋅K) was observed, which was about 235 % increment. The
synergistic  effects  of  hybrid  NPs  significantly  improved  thermal  per-
formance  of  base  PCM.  The  hybrid nano  additives  have  the  best  per-
formance compared to 3D, 2D, 1D, and 0D nano additives. To sum up,
these hybrid nano additives have proved to be the best additives in the
increment  of  value  of  k,  and  future  researchers  should  explore  more
nano  additives  to  understand  better  and  enhance  the  performance  of
base PCM.

In summary, this section has elaborated on the critical role of NPs
dispersed in PCMs for enhancing their thermal properties. The synthesis
and incorporation of various types of nanoparticles, categorized by their
dimensions (0D, 1D, 2D, and 3D), have been explored. These enhance-
ments are evident in various scientific and technological applications,
particularly in thermal energy storage systems.

• 0D nanoparticles: Investigations reveal significant improvements in
thermal conductivity (k value) by including metal and metal oxide
nanoparticles like Cu, Fe, Ag, Al2O3, TiO2, and ZnO in PCMs. These
enhancements  are  attributed  to  factors  like  micro  convection  and
reduced electron pathway resistance.

• 1D  nanoparticles:  This  category,  encompassing  nanorods,  nano-
tubes,  and  nanofibers,  has  considerably  enhanced  PCM  thermal
performance. For instance, carbon fibers and CNTs significantly in-
crease the k value due to their high thermal conductivity.

• 2D nanoparticles: Graphene and its derivatives, prominent in this
category,  have  demonstrated  remarkable  improvements  in  the

Z. Said et al.

thermal  conductivity  of  PCMs.  The  formation  of  continuous
conductive pathways is a key factor in these enhancements.

• 3D  nanoparticles:  This  includes  3D  carbon  materials  and  MOFs,
which, due to their large surface area and volume, are effective in
enhancing the thermal properties of PCMs.

• Hybrid  nanoparticles:  Composites  containing  multiple  types  of
nanomaterials have shown synergistic effects, leading to significant
improvements in thermal conductivity.

In all these categories, the unique properties of nanoparticles, such as
high  surface  area  and  effective  heat  transfer  capabilities,  have  been
leveraged  to  enhance  the  performance  of  PCMs.  These  advancements
improve the efficiency of thermal energy storage systems and open new
avenues  for  innovative  applications  in  various  fields,  ranging  from
electronics cooling to sustainable energy solutions. The diverse studies
and experiments highlighted in this section underscore the potential of
nanoparticle-enhanced PCMs in driving technological progress and en-
ergy  efficiency.  Overall,  the  results  of  the  literature  studies  indicated
that these dimensional nano additives improved the performance of base
PCM, but several issues were identified by adding these additives. For
example,  by  adding  non-carbon-based  additives,  the  value  of  k  was
improved,  but  the  latent  heat  of  fusion  decreased,  resulting  in  an
improved  heat  transfer  rate  while  decreasing  the  amount  of  thermal
energy stored. As a result, graphene and other carbon-based additives
were added to the base PCM to improve the thermal storage capacity and
value of k. This is why these composite PCMs have been widely used in
different  applications.  Nevertheless,  the  repetitive  process  of  melting
and solidifying phase change materials (PCM) leads to mechanical wear
on  metallic  or  carbon-based  structures  that  are  combined  with  com-
posite  PCM  due  to  the  recurring  thermal  stresses.  Hence,  researchers
should address this issue in their future research.

4. Interface between nanomaterials and phase change material

Nanomaterials  embedded  in  phase  change  materials  can  alter  the
base  PCM’s  inherent  thermal  characteristics.  These  nanomaterials
exhibit  a  diminutive  average  size,  an  abundance  of  surface  atoms,  a
substantial specific surface area, and elevated surface energy, making
them highly sought-after as fillers for enhancing thermal conductivity
and  other  thermo-physical  properties.  Nanomaterials  with  unique  di-
mensions interact with PCM in a distinct fraction to enhance the thermo-
physical  properties.  Meanwhile,  nanoparticles  (spherical  or  nearly
spherical in shape) of a variety metals, metal oxides, or polymers are
widely researched with PCM because of high surface-to-volume ratio to
increase  the  thermal  conductivities  of  these  PCMs  after  uniform
dispersion with PCMs. Copper (Cu), gold (Au), silver (Ag), aluminum
oxide  (Al2O3),  titanium  oxide  (TiO2),  zinc  oxide  (ZnO),  copper  oxide
(CuO), titanium  carbide (TiC), silicon  carbide (SiC)  [164], single  and
multiwall  carbon  nanotubes  (SCNTs  and  MWCNTs),  graphene  oxide,
graphene,  exfoliated  graphene  (ExG)  are  the  most  frequently  used
nanoparticles applied for this purpose to improve their use in thermal
applications. Nevertheless, the emerging nanomaterials explored with
PCM  included  Tetrapods  [54],  MXene  [165],  and  conducting  hybrid
polymer [92].

4.1. Essence of nanoparticles integration with PCM

Nanomaterials are dispersed with PCM to overcome the shortcom-
ings of organic PCMs like a) poor thermal conductivity, b) low optical
absorbance, c) flammable nature, d) degree of supercooling (with sugar
alcohols), and e) energy storage ability (heat of fusion). The dispersal of
nanomaterials  using  PCMs  serves  several  functions,  each  yielding
unique advantages in different applications.

• Enhanced  thermal  conductivity:  Nanomaterials,  such  as  carbon
nanotubes  or  graphene,  possess  remarkable  thermal  conductivity

properties. When integrated into PCM, they can substantially amplify
the  composite  material’s  overall  thermal  conductivity.  This
advancement  facilitates  a  more  efficient  heat  transfer  during  the
phase  change  process,  leading  to  expedited  heat  absorption  or
release [93].

• Stability  and  homogeneity:  Nanomaterials  play  a  crucial  role  in
stabilizing and homogenizing the dispersion of PCM. They effectively
prevent  phase  separation  or  agglomeration,  ensuring  a  consistent
distribution of the PCM within the composite material. This unifor-
mity significantly improves the overall performance and reliability of
the PCM composite.

• Increased surface area: Nanomaterials typically exhibit high sur-
face  area-to-volume  ratios  due  to  their  small  size  and  high  aspect
ratio.  Incorporating  nanomaterials  into  PCM  composites  increases
the  available  surface  area  for  heat  transfer,  resulting  in  improved
thermal  performance.  This  characteristic  is  particularly  advanta-
geous  in  applications  that  require  rapid  heat  exchange,  such  as
thermal energy storage systems.

• Mechanical  reinforcement:  Certain  nanomaterials’  mechanical
properties  are  exceptional,  boasting  high  strength  and  stiffness.
When  these  nanomaterials  are  incorporated  into  PCM,  they  effec-
tively reinforce the composite’s structural integrity, providing pro-
tection against deformation or damage caused by thermal cycling or
handling. This reinforcement of mechanical properties significantly
extends the lifespan and durability of products based on PCM.
• Tunable properties: The use of nanomaterials grants the flexibility
to  tailor  PCM  composites  according  to  specific  application  re-
quirements.  By  adjusting  parameters  such  as  the  type  of  nano-
particles,  their  concentration,  and  the  method  of  dispersion,  it
becomes possible to fine-tune properties like thermal conductivity,
latent  heat  storage  capacity,  and  the  range  of  phase  change  tem-
perature [166].

• Leak  resistance:  The  leak  problem  during  phase  transition  is
resolved via a supporting stuff called base like xGnP, EG etc., which
is needed to stabilize the PCM. So, a high-pore base is required to
stop the PCM from leakage. The desired convenient porous structural
network is fabricated via synergistic effects of suitable crosslinking
reaction and pyrolysis temperature [167].

• Improved  optical absorbance:  Nanoparticles  facilitate  more con-
jugated π bonding between nanomaterial and PCMs, enhancing the
photon absorbance in IR region. Furthermore, nanomaterials enable
stronger spectral absorbance effects owing to the multiple reflections
of light rays on the planar surface. As a black material, nanomaterials
also offer low reflectivity and trap light rays, photons, and molecular
heaters [168].

Overall,  dispersing  nanomaterials  with  PCM  enables  the  develop-
ment of advanced composite materials with enhanced thermal proper-
ties,  mechanical  strength,  and  versatility,  making  them  suitable  for  a
wide range of applications, including TES, temperature regulation, and
heat management systems.

4.2. Delving into the dynamics of interaction within PCM

As much as the interaction mechanism is concerned, it is predomi-
nant to discuss the inter-and-intramolecular force of attraction between
PCM molecules as they describe the energy storage potential of PCM as
PCMs are energy materials. Intermolecular force of attraction between
PCMs varies for different classes of organic PCM (sugar alcohol, poly-
mers, fatty acids etc.) as shown in Fig. 6 as hydrogen bonding; coulombic
interaction, and dispersion interaction. Fig. 6 shows the common types
of intermolecular interaction occurring between PCMs owing to changes
in melting enthalpy, which is predominant in organic PCM. Likewise, in
the case of salt and metals, they undergo only one type of interaction:
electrostatic interaction; whereas inorganic salt hydrates undergo two
types of interaction, and polymers and ionic liquids undergo multiple

interactions between the molecules.

Hydrogen bonding is one of the important interactions that disperse
the nanoparticles in the PCMs. Fig. 6a indicates hydrogen bonding in the
crystal structure of D-mannitol, a class of sugar alcohol, because of the
hydrogen bonding between the molecules of PCM. Fatty acid derivatives
offer the opportunity to effectively modify the melting temperature and
enhance properties like corrosivity, unpleasant odor, and sublimation.
Incorporating extra functional groups like NH2  or OH can elevate the
melting point compared to the original compound, likely

due  to  the  augmented  presence  of  inter-  and  intramolecular
hydrogen bonds. In general, interaction between salt hydrate (a com-
bination of salt and hydrate molecule) is bonded by ionic and hydrogen
bonds. The predominant factor contributing to the considerably higher
enthalpies  of  fusion  observed  in  aprotic  dicationic  ionic  liquids  con-
taining  imidazolium  cations  is  primarily  the  presence  of  hydrogen
bonds. In-depth investigations utilizing single crystal X-ray crystallog-
raphy  have  provided  detailed  insights  into  the  significant  role  of
hydrogen bonding in determining heat of fusion, while also revealing
the complexity of this relationship. The presence of a larger number of
hydrogen  bonds can have a  negative impact  if it  results in weakened
interactions or unfavorable geometries. On the other hand, stronger and
more linear bonds and an appropriate balance of hydrogen bond donors
and acceptors are considered more advantageous. These comprehensive
structural studies are particularly crucial in enabling the design of new
PCMs with higher heat of fusion. However, it is essential to complement
this approach with a comprehensive understanding of the liquid state
structure to understand the structural and energetic changes that occur
during the melting process.

Carbon nanotubes are well-known nanomaterials with smaller par-
ticle size and larger surface area, which easily affect the interaction with
PCM  molecules.  It  gets  easily  diffused  and  rearranged  into  the  PCM
molecule.  So,  the  thermal  conductivity  is  increased,  and  latent  heat
energy is reduced [170]. Surface functionalization is also a method to
improve the intermolecular interactions and, as a result, increased latent
heat energy. Coulombic interaction, also known as electrostatic inter-
action or Coulomb force, is a fundamental concept in physics that de-
scribes the force between electrically charged particles (Fig. 6b).

Regarding PCMs, coulombic interaction doesn’t play a primary role,
as  most  PCMs  undergo  phase  transition  owing  to  thermal  energy
transfer. Nonetheless, in certain cases, coulombic interaction influences
the dispersion stability of PCM to overcome phase separation and ag-
gregation behavior and ensure stability in PCM nanocomposites. Like-
wise, the influence of van der Waals forces on the pertinent properties of
materials  and  their  potential  as  PCMs  cannot  be  underestimated.
Although van der Waals forces are about 10 times weaker than hydrogen
bonds, they can still significantly impact the enthalpy of fusion in certain
PCMs due to their distance-dependent nature. Consequently, paraffin,

which  only  experiences intermolecular  van  der Waals  forces, exhibits
the highest enthalpies of fusion among all PCM families, reaching up to
130 kJ/kg. The melting points and heats of fusion per mole of linear
paraffins generally increase with longer hydrocarbon chain lengths due
to the additional van der Waals forces per molecule. However, odd or
even numbers of carbons in the chain also influence these properties.

Similarly, long chain alkyl polymers exhibit stronger van der Waals
force  between  PCM  molecules,  resulting  in  higher  heat  of  fusion  and
PCM with higher phase transition temperature (Fig. 6c). However, few
long chain polymers also undergo dipole-dipole interaction between the
molecules,  e.g.,  polyethylene  glycol.  Vander-Waal’s  interaction  also
tends to increase the interaction between nanoparticles and PCM and
enhances the properties of NePCM. A strong Vander-Waal’s interaction
on the surface of PCM leads to high latent heat capacity and vice versa.
This interaction of secondary forces is confirmed by GO decline in latent
heat energy in NePCM due to the weak v<fan der-Waal’s forces inter-
action in GO [171].

4.3. Mechanisms of interaction among PCM molecules and nanomaterials

When  nanomaterials  are  dispersed  within  organic  PCMs,  several
types  of  interactions  can  occur, contributing  to the  overall  properties
and performance of the composite material comprising of a) enhanced
heat  transfer;  b)  dispersion  stability;  c)  interfacial  interaction;  d)
nucleation  effect;  e)  resistance  against  flame  and  f)  ability  to  offer
tunable properties. Nanomaterials (CNTs & GNP) generally offer higher
intrinsic thermal conductance than PCM matrix. The nanomaterials act
as a thermal connectivity channel with the PCM during the dispersion of
these nanomaterials within the PCM matrix. The larger surface area of
nanomaterial is an added advantage that suppresses phonons’ scattering
and  develops  a  thermal  bridge  at  the  interface  of  nanomaterials  and
PCM. In the case of tetrapods nanomaterial (the newly explored nano-
material  with  PCM);  they  show  fin-like  extruded  arms  expected  to
contribute to enhancing the heat transfer rate. These fin shaped tetrapod
arms  support  the  formation  of  thermal  networks  in  both  vertical  and
horizontal directions especially at the low filler spots, thereby increasing
the heat transfer rate [54]. When compared to other 3D nanoparticles
like  expanded  graphite
[172]  and
spherical-shaped metal nitride, carbonitride, and carbide nanoparticles,
the  tetrapod  with  four  arms  exhibits  a  distinctive  shape.  With  its
fin-shaped arms, this unique structure offers an exceptional surface area,
leading to enhanced heat transfer rates.

(stacks  of  multi-layers)

In continuation, the other predominant mechanism to discuss is the
dispersion stability of nanomaterial and PCM matrix, which is enhanced
by a) surface modification; b) stearic hindrance; c) electrostatic repul-
sion;  d)  hydrophilic/hydrophobic  interaction;  e)  sonication  and  me-
chanical  mixing  and  f)  inclusion  of  surfactants  or  dispersants  to  the

nanocomposite. In regard to surface modification, the nanomaterials are
either functionalized [87] or coated with surfactants to enhance their
compatibility  with  PCM  matrix.  This  surface  modification  alters  the
nanomaterial’s  surface  chemistry,  resulting  in  a  tendency  to  agglom-
erate. Bonding of a functional group or polymer chain with the surface of
nanomaterial causes stearic hindrance, which prevents close proximity
between PCM and nanomaterial; this mode of interaction between PCM
and  nanomaterial  maintains  a  uniform  distribution  for  a  repeated
number  of  thermal  cycles.  Hydrophilic  interaction  in  phase  change
materials (PCMs) dispersed with nanoparticles pertains to the attraction
or bonding between water molecules or polar solvents and the surface of
nanoparticles that are distributed throughout the PCM matrix. Whereas
hydrophobic  interaction  is  the  tendency  of  nonpolar  molecules  to
combine amongst themselves in an aqueous medium. This interaction
becomes  significant  when  the  PCM  or  its  surrounding  environment
comprises water or other polar molecules, commonly this mechanism is
predominant in salt hydrate. Interaction of nanomaterials and PCM also
vary based on the synthesis and dispersion technique. Fig. 7a displays
the formation mechanism of graphene nanomaterials dispersed paraffin
adopting pickering emulsion templating technique. The core indent of
this research was to develop a form stable encapsulated PCM, that offers
improved  thermal  conductivity  and  facilitates  resistance  towards
leakage issue. A comprehensive investigation was conducted to examine
the effects of different concentrations of graphene and core/shell ratio
on  the  shape,  thermal  features,  leakage  prevention  properties,  and
light-to-thermal energy conversion efficiency of micro PCMs. By acting
as  a  pickering  stabilizer,  graphene  facilitates  the  development  of  a
protective layer on the surface of paraffin droplets. This protective layer
then serves as the platform for the polymerization of the MF polymer
shell on the emulsion droplet’s surface. Likewise, Fig. 7b displays the
synthesis  route  and  interaction  mechanism  involved  in  curing  stable
stabilized  polyurethane  composite.  This  research  developed  a  cross-
linking polyurethane via thermal curing of polyethylene glycol mono-
methyl  ether  based  flexible  chain.  The  polyurethane  composite,
resembling  a comb-like structure,  was utilized as  a  supportive frame-
work for encapsulating myristic acid for TES. The presence of the long
side chains greatly enhanced the interaction between myristic acid and
the polymer matrix, thereby improving the distribution of myristic acid.
Zhang  et  al.  [173]  investigated  to  improve  the  encapsulation  ca-
pacity of paraffin using graphene oxide to improve leakage prevention,
offering potential for advanced TES. As seen in Fig. 7c and d two kinds of
protective screens were developed during phase transition to overcome
leakage. In this technique, the paraffin microsphere is covered by gra-
phene oxide nanosheets. Once the core reaches its melting temperature,
the  paraffin  molecules  can  only  escape  through  the  border  and  the
interlayer of graphene oxide layers. This unique structure of two pro-
tective screens increases the path length of leakage. If there are holes
and cracks, the paraffin leakage will continue until it completely leaks.
Besides these different types of weak interactions chemical potential
energy there is also strong ionic and covalent bond interactions chemical
potential energy. Furthermore, metal oxide such as Al2O3 dispersed on
the surface of PCM decreases the latent heat capacity of NePCM, which
may  be due to the weak interaction between PCM and the surface  of
aluminum  oxide  nanoparticles  during  the  slight  decrease  in  eutectic
phase transition.

4.4. Mathematical and theoretical models on the aspect of nanomaterial
enhanced PCMs

Theoretical  or mathematical models are crucial in comprehending
intricate phenomena, offering valuable insights, forecasts, and optimi-
zations  that  steer  scientific  and  engineering  pursuits.  These  models
condense  empirical  data  into  fundamental  principles,  allowing  for  a
deeper understanding and extrapolation beyond the limitations of ex-
periments. They facilitate the testing of hypotheses, exploration of sce-
narios, and the design of experiments, materials, and systems. Models’

predictive capabilities facilitate decision-making, risk assessment, and
resource  allocation.  In  various  fields,  ranging  from  physics  to  eco-
nomics,  models  act  as  intellectual  frameworks,  fostering  innovation,
problem-solving, and the advancement of knowledge. Ultimately, they
empower humanity to navigate the universe’s complexities, shaping our
understanding  and  influencing  our  future.  The  interplay  between
nanoparticles and PCMs is a subject that garners great interest due to its
potential applications in various fields like thermal energy storage, heat
transfer  enhancement,  and  advanced  materials  science.  Furthermore,
dispersion of nanomaterial with the PCM matrix tends to influence the
following a) thermal conductivity; b) viscosity; c) density, and d) sta-
bility of nanocomposite.

• Thermal conductivity: A definitive theoretical model for accurately
forecasting  the  effective  thermal  conductivity  of  composite  PCM
does not exist. However, several semi-empirical models derived from
experimental research are available and offer a practical means of
predicting effective thermal conductivity. These models incorporate
diverse parameters, including the thermal conductivities of the base
fluid and enhancers, the volume fraction, particle size, surface area,
nanoparticle shape, Brownian motion, and temperature.

Maxwell suggested [176] a model to anticipate the effective thermal
conductivity  of  solid-liquid  mixtures  composite  with  relatively  large
particles (micro and mini size) and low solid concentrations (low vol-
ume fraction). The model’s effective thermal conductivity, keff, is given
in Equation (5).

knanoparticle  and  kPCM  signifies  the  thermal  conductivity  of  the  nano-
particle  and  base  PCM,  while  ∅  signifies  the  volume  fraction  of  the
particle in the mixture.

Bruggeman [177] put forth a correlation as in Equation (6) to esti-
mate  the  effective  thermal  conductivity  of  solid-liquid  composites  at
different solid concentrations.

Equation (6)

The Bruggeman relationship behaves similarly to the Maxwell model
when the volume fraction is low. However, the Maxwell model fails to
represent  the  experimental  data  accurately  at  high  volume  fractions,
while the Bruggeman relationship demonstrates good agreement with
the  experimental  results.  Subsequently,  the  effective  thermal  conduc-
tivity model developed by Hamilton et al. [178] for liquid-solid mixtures
with nonspherical particles introduces a shape factor, denoted as n. This
model specifically addresses particles with higher thermal conductivity,
where the ratio of conductivities between the solid particles and the base
fluid is greater than 100. The effective thermal conductivity is mathe-
matically expressed as in Equation (7).

The parameters of this model are identical to those of the Maxwell or
Bruggeman model, except for the inclusion of a shape factor, n. Unlike
the  classical  models  mentioned  above,  which  rely  on  continuum  for-
mulations,  this  model  takes  into  account  the  shape  and/or  volume
fraction  of  particles  and  assumes  diffusive  heat  transport  in  both  the
liquid and solid phases.

• Viscosity (μ): With the increased loading rate of the nanoparticle
with  PCM  for  enhancing  the  thermal  performance,  there  is  a  sub-
stantial increase in μ  of the PCM nanocomposite. An increase in μ

weakens the buoyancy effect, which is a crucial aspect in the context
of PCM melting. The melting process of PCM is dictated by natural
convection.  As  a  result,  the  governing  equations  include  the
Navier(cid:0) Stokes equations in conjunction with the energy equation.
Subsequently,  the  orientation  of  PCM  cavity  is  essential  influence
able  in  natural  convection,  as  it  is  driven  by  buoyancy  effect.
Therefore,  at  a  high  concentration  of  dispersed  nanoparticles,  the
degree of the detrimental impact of μ enhancement offsets the pos-
itive  influence  of  thermal  conductivity  enhancement.  Hence,
choosing the optimum concentration of nano additives for various
nanoparticle PCM combinations is crucial. The Brinkmann model in
Equation  (8)  provides  the  empirical  formula  for  the  effective  vis-
cosity (μeff) of the composite PCM, where μPCM  represents the vis-
cosity of the base PCM and φ is the volume fraction of the dispersed
nanoparticle [179].

• Density: The inclusion of metal nanoparticles in PCM has demon-
strated some positive impact on thermal conductivity. However, the
enhancements observed were not as remarkable as those achieved by
incorporating carbon-based nano additives. It is important to note
that  metal  nanoparticles  have  a  higher  density  than  carbon-based
nano  additives.  Consequently,  the  dispersion  of  metal  nano-
particles may adversely affect the composite PCM’s effective density
(ρeff), which can be evaluated numerically by Equation (9).

• Stability of Nanocomposite: Ensuring the stability of nanoparticles
dispersed  in  PCMs  is  essential  for  maintaining  the  long-term  per-
formance of nanocomposite materials. The dispersion stability and
likelihood of agglomeration are influenced by the surface chemistry
of nanoparticles and the interaction between nanoparticles and PCM
molecules. The Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory
can be used to predict the colloidal stability of nanoparticle disper-
sions  in  PCMs.  However,  DLVO  theory  demonstrated  different
theoretical  models  based  on  the  van  der  Waals  force  of  attraction
(interaction of electrons in particle), electrostatic double layer force,
hydrophobic force (entropic penalty of separating hydrogen bonds),
and bridging attraction [180]. Nonetheless, as far as nanocomposite
PCM  are  concerned,  van  der  Waals  force  of  attraction  and  hydro-
phobic force, as in Equations (10) and (11), are predominant.

4.5. Crucial features and defining attributes

These interactions lead us to the following main point:

• The  stronger  interactive  forces  between  nanoparticles  and  phase
change material indicated a monodispersed phase, which increases
thermal  conductivity  and  decreases  the  latent  heat  energy  of
NePCMs in a broader sense.

• Latent heat energy is not decreased in all NePCM, but it depends on
the nanomaterial and their intermolecular forces such as in the case
of  MWCNT  the  latent  heat  energy  is  increased  due  to  the  greater
intermolecular interaction in the PCM.

• The  surface  functionalization  of  these  nanoparticles  results  in  a
strong  intermolecular  interaction,  and  consequently,  the  thermal
conductivity and latent heat energy is increased.

• The chemical potential energy of nano dispersed phase change ma-

terial is the main factor influencing latent heat energy.

• Capillary and surface tension forces help the nanoparticles, and PCM

interact and save NePCM’s energy storage capacity.

• As  the  Brownian  motion  of  nanoparticles  increases,  the  thermal

• The nucleation effect also increases the thermal conductivity due to
the  interaction  of  neighboring  nanoparticles  embedded  in  the
NePCM matrix.

• The  main  aspects  of  optimizing  NePCM  for  energy  storage  and
thermal  conductivities  are  surface  functionalization  and  different
secondary interactions.

Insights  for  the  readers  based  on  the  above  review  are  that  the
interaction  between  nanoparticles  and  PCMs  plays  a  vital  role  in
enhancing the performance of PCMs, particularly in terms of thermal
conductivity and energy storage efficiency. This section has detailed the
various  mechanisms  of  interaction  and  their  resultant  effects  on  the
properties of NePCMs. The key points are:

• Purpose  of  integration:  Incorporating  nanoparticles  into  both
organic  and  inorganic  PCMs  addresses  their  inherent  limitations,
such as low thermal conductivity and leakage during phase transi-
tions. This enhancement is crucial for achieving high thermal con-
ductivity, efficient heat storage, and stability.

• Mechanisms  of  interaction:  The  interactions  include  intermolec-
ular  forces,  Vander-Waal’s  forces,  hydrogen  bonding,  and  strong
ionic  or  covalent  bonds.  These  interactions  significantly  influence
the dispersion, stability, and overall performance of NePCMs.

• Effect  on  thermal  properties:  Enhanced  interactions  between
nanoparticles and PCMs lead to improved thermal conductivity and
modified latent heat capacities. Factors such as particle size, surface
area,  and  surface  functionalization  play  critical  roles  in  these
enhancements.

• Variations with different nanomaterials: Different nanomaterials,
such  as  carbon-based  materials,  metal  oxides,  and  functionalized
nanoparticles,  show  varying  degrees  of  impact  on  the  thermal
properties of PCMs. The type of nanoparticle and its intermolecular
interactions with the PCM matrix determine the extent of enhance-
ment in thermal conductivity and latent heat capacity.

• Energy storage and efficiency: Integrating nanoparticles contrib-
utes to better energy storage capacities and NePCMs efficiency. This
is achieved through mechanisms like capillary action, surface tension
forces, and nucleation effects, which facilitate improved interaction
between nanoparticles and PCM.

• Future optimization: Surface functionalization and the exploration
of secondary interactions present promising avenues for the further
optimization  of  NePCMs,  particularly  for  applications  in  energy
storage and thermal conductivity enhancement.

This  section  emphasizes  the  significance  of  nanoparticle-PCM  in-
teractions  in  advancing  the  effectiveness  of  PCMs  in  various  applica-
tions. The synergistic effects of nanoparticles with PCMs improve the
thermal  properties  and  open  up  new  possibilities  for  innovative  and
efficient energy storage solutions.

5. Influence of nanoparticles on thermophysical properties of
phase change materials

NePCM  is  developed  by  dispersing  nanoparticles  within  the  PCM
matrix.  The  thermo-physical  characteristics  of  NePCM  and  PCM  are
undoubtedly  different  owing  to  the  presence  of  nanoparticles.  The
impact of introducing nanoparticles and how their characteristics alter
the  thermophysical  properties  of  PCMs  are  covered  in  this  section.
Table  5  presents  a  comprehensive  overview  of  the  thermo-physical
properties  of  nano-enhanced  PCMs  that  have  been  examined  by
different researchers and documented in the existing literature.

5.1. Melting point

The melting temperature of PCMs plays a crucial role in their suit-
ability  for  implementation  in  real-time  applications.  PCMs  should  be
selected based on the operating temperature range for selected appli-
cations. It is advisable to ensure that the melting temperature of PCMs
used  in  TES  systems  is  lower  than  the  temperature  of  the  heating
element  and  higher  than  the  ambient  temperature.  The  utilization  of
nanoparticles  in  PCMs  significantly  influences  its  thermo-physical
properties.  The  phase  transition  temperature  indicates  a  crucial  tem-
perature threshold at which a PCM undergoes a transition from a solid

◦

◦

state to a liquid state or vice versa. For instance, in the case of photo-
voltaic panels and battery thermal management applications, the tem-
C  [181].  Similarly,  the
perature  should  be  maintained  below  50
temperature should be kept below 20
C for refrigeration applications.
The  incorporation  of  NPs  has  a  notable  impact  on  both  the  inter-
molecular  forces  of  attraction  and  the  thermal  conductivity  of  PCMs.
Consequently,  this  leads  to  a  slight  modification  in  the  melting  tem-
perature of NePCM, either increasing or decreasing it. The modification
of  the  melting  temperature  is  contingent  upon  the  interplay  of  inter-
molecular forces, molecular bonding, and the structural characteristics
of  nanoparticles  [48].  As  per  previous  studies,  the  change  in  melting
temperature after nanoparticle addition is minor. However, a slight in-
crease in melting temperature is because of increased thermal conduc-
tivity.  The  impact  of  nanoparticles  on  phase  change  temperatures,
specifically during the melting and freezing process, does not exhibit an
apparent trend. It can be argued that the increment or decrement values
are often  negligible. The influence of nanoparticles is less  on melting
temperature because nanoparticles have high melting temperatures and
they do not participate in the melting process. However, adding nano-
particles alters the intermolecular forces that cause a slight change in
melting temperature. As experimental research [182] added mono and
hybrid  nanoparticles  to  base  paraffin  PCM,  a  slight  decrease  in  peak
melting temperature was observed. The peak melting temperature for

a  composite  material  consisting  of  multiwall  carbon  nanotube
(MWCNT),  graphene  (Gr),  and  expanded  graphite  (EG)  NePCM  was
analysed critically. The researchers observed a marginal decrease in the
melting temperature of PCM, with the pure PCM exhibiting a melting
temperature  of  46.6
C,  while  the  NePCM  demonstrated  a  melting
◦
temperature  of  46.1
C  [186].  The  detail  of  further  different
nano-enhanced composite melting temperatures can be seen in Table 5.
Melting temperature is a crucial factor that has to be looked at is how
nano  additions  affect  the  PCM.  Because  of  the  dispersion  of  nano-
particles,  which  has  slightly  altered  the  melting  temperature  of  the
nanocomposites, the findings presented in the literature are not defini-
tive.  The  melting  temperature  has  increased  in  some  research  and  in
◦
others. However, the difference in melting temperature is only up to 3
C
[40].  Further  research  is  needed  to  comprehend  how  nano  additions
affect the phase transition temperature. In general, it can be observed
that  the  range  of  phase  change  temperatures  is  influenced  by  factors
such as the specific type of PCM, the presence of nanoparticles, and the
concentration of nanoparticles within the PCM.

5.2. Thermal conductivity

Thermal conductivity is a property that pertains to the transfer of
vibrational  energy  between  particles  through  collisions,  without  any
accompanying movement of matter. The process of thermal conductivity
can be described as follows: initially, heat energy is transferred to sur-
face  atoms,  resulting  in  the  acquisition  of  vibrational  energy.  Subse-
quently, the thermal energy undergoes a transfer to adjacent atoms at an
equivalent velocity, resembling the propagation of a wave as shown in
Fig.  8a.  Afterward,  the  thermal  energy  is  distributed  throughout  the
crystal via a collective vibrational mode or phonons. Even at low tem-
peratures, the particles within the crystal exhibit vibrational motion in
close  proximity  to  their  equilibrium  positions.  Therefore,  the  lattice
structure of the PCM can be conceptualized as a  system consisting of
interconnected masses and springs, as shown in Fig. 8b. The oscillation
of the crystal will experience displacement from its equilibrium position
when  exposed  to  thermal  energy.  Subsequently,  the  generation  and
diffusion  of  high  energy  phonons  occur,  establishing  a  temperature
gradient.  Consequently,  thermal  energy  will  transfer  from  the  higher
temperature region to the lower temperature region when a temperature
gradient is present as shown in Fig. 8c. Upon reaching the opposite end
of the crystal, thermal energy is partially dissipated into the surrounding
environment  through  convection,  conduction,  or  radiation.  In  the
context of metallic materials, thermal conductivity primarily arises from
the  movement  of  electrons,  as  determined  by  the  Wiedermann-Franz
law. Conversely, the contribution of phonons  to thermal conductivity
in non-metallic PCMs, such as inorganic PCMs, is negligible. This is due
to the limited presence of free electrons within the crystal lattice of non-
metallic  PCMs,  which  hinders  their  ability  to  transfer  heat.  In  this
instance, the crystal lattice’s vibrations are major in heat transport. The
crystal structure’s constituent

particles oscillate around an equilibrium location. However, when
the crystal is exposed to heat, this equilibrium is disrupted, generating
high-energy phonons. The efficient diffusion of these phonons leads to a
high thermal conductivity. Conversely, various factors, such as phonon-
phonon  scattering,  phonon-defect  scattering,  and  phonon-boundary
scattering,  obstruct  the  movement  of  phonons,  resulting  in  a  shorter
mean free path. Consequently, this leads to increased interfacial thermal
resistance  and  decreased  thermal  conductivity,  as  shown  in  Fig.  8d

[187].

The NPs exhibit enhanced thermal conductivity compared to other
bulk  solid  materials  due  to  their  significantly  greater  surface  area  to
volume ratio, typically exceeding that of micro-particles by a factor of
1000 [188]. As an illustration, the thermal conductivity of single-walled
carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) is 5000 W/(m⋅K), while paraffin RT44 has a
thermal conductivity of 0.23 W/(m⋅K). Therefore, incorporating these
highly conductive particles into PCM will improve their thermal con-
ductivity. The thermal conductivity of PCM is enhanced by factors such
as the

weight  fraction,  size,  and  form  of  the  particles.  Nevertheless,  the
addition  of  highly  conductive  nanoparticles  does  not  substantially
enhance the thermal conductivity of the Phase Change Material (PCM).
In  order  to  improve  the  thermal  conductivity  of  PCM,  it  is  crucial  to
attain a homogeneous dispersion of NPs across the PCM. When NPs are
not  uniformly  dispersed  within  PCM,  they  tend  to  aggregate.  Conse-
quently, these aggregated NPs do not contribute to enhancing thermal
conductivity in the PCM. Further, the increase in thermal conductivity is
influenced by other factors: the weight percentage and temperature of
the composite. Wang et al. [192] analysed the impact of these factors on
a composite of paraffin and titanium oxide (TiO2). Their findings indi-
cate that the thermal conductivity improves with the wt. % of NPs up to
a certain threshold. However, beyond this threshold, the thermal con-
ductivity decreases when the temperature exceeds the melting temper-
ature of PCM. Further, the thermal conductivity of NPs is influenced by
their size and shape, as indicated by the analysis. The combination of a
small size and cubic shape results in an increased aspect ratio, enhancing
the  thermal conductivity  of PCMs. Additionally,  thermal  conductivity
can be influenced by factors such as morphology, heat capacity, phonon
mean free paths, and phonon group velocities, which can either increase
or decrease its value [193].

Numerous researchers have investigated using various combinations
of  NePCMs  to  enhance  composites’  thermal  conductivity  for  thermal
energy  storage  applications.  Most  individuals  use  carbon-based  NPs,
which  exhibit  greater  thermal  conductivity  than  metal-  and  ceramic-
based particles, as shown in Table 5. Metal and ceramic nanoparticles
exhibit  lower  thermal  conductivity  compared  to  carbon-based  nano-
particles, resulting in a reduced enhancement in thermal conductivity in
nanocomposites  based  on  metal  and  ceramic  nanoparticles.  Further,
hybridization  of  carbon-metal,  carbon-carbon,  ceramic-carbon  and
other nanoparticles improved thermal conductivity due to a synergistic
effect.  As  the  investigation  [231]  exhibited,  the  MWCNT  and  GNP
hybrid nanoparticles showed higher thermal conductivity enhancement
compared to mono carbon and metal nanoparticles as shown in Fig. 8e.
The dispersion of NPs can enhance thermal conductivity in PCMs. This is
due to the fact that when the size of NPs decreases, the surface-volume
ratio rises, leading to an increase in heat transfer inside the PCMs [194].
Therefore, it can be inferred that a high level of thermal conductivity
decreases the duration required for both the solidification and melting
processes of PCMs. According to the literature [44,195] and as shown in
Table 5, the majority of the research has used concentrations of nano-
particles ranging from 0.2 to 5 wt%. This choice was driven by the fact
that increased thermal conductivity may significantly impact the other
characteristics  of  PCM.  In  addition,  the  size  and  structure  of  nano-
materials  are  additional  crucial  factors  that  are  often  overlooked  in
comparison  to  the  mass  fraction  concentration  during  investigations.
The carbon based nanoparticles are considered to be better performers
in terms  of thermal conductivity due to their higher  thermal conduc-
tivity  values,  lower  densities,  and  better  homogeneous  mixing  with
PCMs.

5.3. Latent heat capacity

The  phenomenon  of  energy  absorption  or  release  by  a  material
during  its  heating  or  cooling  process  at  a  constant  temperature,  is
referred to as latent heat. The process of melting involves the absorption

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience104(2024)10116227

Z. Said et al.

of  heat  energy,  which  is  used  to  counteract  the  intermolecular  in-
teractions between molecules corresponding to an endothermic process.
Conversely, heat energy is released during solidification, resulting in the
arrangement of molecules in an ordered form, termed as an exothermic
process [196], as seen in Fig. 8f. In alternative means, latent heat refers
to the quantity of thermal energy that may be contained inside a kilo-
gram of a certain material. Consequently, substances with greater latent
heat values need a smaller mass for thermal energy storage, which re-
sults  in  reduced  costs  for  thermal  storage  systems  using  NePCM.  The
desirable NePCM parameter is a larger value of latent heat; the higher
the latent heat, the lesser the mass required for TES. Incorporating NPs
into PCMs is a strategy used to enhance their relatively poor thermal
conductivity. However, the introduction of nanoparticles might alter the
latent heat characteristics of the PCM. In most cases, the inclusion of
nanoparticles  in  PCM  results  in  a  decrease  in  its  latent  heat  [74]
compared to the pure base PCM, as given in Table 5, while in some cases,
it has improved too [197]. The alteration in the latent heat of PCM may
be attributed to substituting PCM with NPs.

Additionally, a strong intermolecular connection between PCM and
nanoparticles suggests a strong van der Waals attraction based on the
Lennard-Jones  potential,  and  this  strong  interaction  raises  the  latent
heat of fusion [198]. However, excessive loading of heavy nanoparticles
has the opposite effect, reducing the latent heat due to several factors.
These  factors  include  a  decrease  in  the  mass  portion  of  PCM,  the
enthalpy of non-melting nanoparticles, and changes in the dimensions
and surface characteristics of the PCM [199]. Additionally, the presence
of NPs prevents the realignment of molecules within the PCM matrix,
which lowers the latent heat of the nanocomposite PCM [196].

The change in latent heat of PCM on nanoparticle addition did not
follow the certain trend in the literature. As in the study [200], paraffin
PCM  was  added  with  Al2O3  and  Fe2O3  NPs.  On  NPs  addition,  both
nanocomposite  outcomes  demonstrated  comparable  improvements  in
thermal  conductivity.  However,  the  disparity  was  observed  in  their
impact  on  latent  heat  capacity  throughout  the  solidification  process.
Upon careful  examination, it  becomes evident  that introducing  Al2O3
nano additions at varying concentrations exhibits a gradual decline in
the latent heat capacity of the resultant NePCM. This may primarily be
attributed to a reduction in the mass fraction of the PCM.

Nevertheless, the use of Fe2O3 nanoparticles as additions leads to a
significant reduction in latent heat, mostly attributed to their magnetic
characteristics. As an example, when the concentration of Fe2O3 is 8 wt
%, the latent heat exhibits a reduction of 65.41 %. In contrast, when the
concentration of Al2O3 is the same, the drop in latent heat is 7.85 %.

Similarly,  in  another  study  [190],  the  authors  added  GNP  nano-
particles ranging from 1 to 2 wt% in polyethylene glycol (PEG 4000).
The authors compared latent heat reduction and thermal conductivity
improvement, as depicted in Fig. 8g. As per analysis, as the amount of
GNPs rises, there is a steady drop in latent heat, but thermal conductivity
increases. This suggests that incorporating GNPs in composites enhances
thermal conductivity but at the expense of reduced latent heat. Further,
the incorporation of 2 wt% GNPs leads to a notable enhancement of 146
% in thermal conductivity while causing a relatively little decrease of
6.3 % in the latent heat of the PEG used in the present study. Hence,
including  a  moderate  proportion  of  GNPs  in  the  composite  material
should  be  advantageous  in  achieving  the  desired  latent  heat  capacity
and improving thermal conductivity. Further, it is recommended that
research  endeavours  focus  on  investigating  the  minimal  decrease  of
latent heat in NePCM by incorporating NPs.

Additionally, efforts should be made to explore optimization strate-
gies that have the least influence on the latent heat, or that may facilitate
surface functionalization. The research findings [191] demonstrated a
significant enhancement in the latent heat capacity of PCMs by 31.5 %
via  the  use  of  nano  porous  structured  Attapulgite  (ATP)  with  surface
modification.  The  interaction  between  polyethylene  glycol  (PEG) and
the  modified  Attapulgite  (m-ATP)  further  validates  the  observed  in-
crease in latent heat capacity, as the results presented in Fig. 8h indicate

sustained improvement even after undergoing 800 cycles. The investi-
gation  into  the  impact  of  nanoparticle  addition  on  the  latent  heat  of
PCMs is currently in the research stage and requires more elucidation by
researchers.  As  previously  highlighted,  the  enhancement  of  thermal
conductivity plays a crucial role in maximizing the storage capacity of
PCMs. However, it is essential to take into account the possible positive
or negative effects on the latent heat of the PCMs. Further, In order to get
a comprehensive understanding, it is imperative to do more research in
the future that investigates the ideal size, shape, and concentration of
NPs that effectively strike a balance between thermal conductivity and
latent heat.

5.4. Thermal diffusivity

The concept of thermal diffusivity refers to the measure of the rate at
which  temperature  propagates  inside  a  certain  material.  The  concept
referred  to  is  quantifying  thermal  energy  transfer  inside  a  given  me-
dium. Thermal diffusivity plays a crucial role in characterizing the ef-
ficiency of PCMs inside energy storage systems, as it dictates the rate of
diffusion during heat transfer. Hence, the examination of thermal con-
ductivity, latent heat, and heat capacity individually lacks adequacy in
forecasting the comprehensive augmentation of heat transfer in PCMs or
in modelling and simulating the behaviour of PCMs.

Only  a  limited  number  of  prior  research  have  thoroughly  investi-
gated  this  additional  thermo-physical  feature.  In  research  work  on
eutectic PCM of lauric acid (LA) and methyl palmitate in (40:60) was
prepared. As per analysis, the thermal diffusivity values for the solid and
liquid phases of the eutectic binary combination were determined to be
0.134and  0.105  mm2/s,  respectively  [201].  The  study  added  eutectic
PCM of lauric acid and methyl palmitate in (40:60) with 10 wt% of GNP
nanoparticles. The results exhibited an improvement in thermal diffu-
sivity.  The  nano-eutectic  composite  diffusivity  appeared  to  be  0.15
mm2/s compared to 0.134 mm2/s. Similarly, in another study [153] on
RT50  PCM  was  evaluated  by  adding  graphene  NPs.  The  results
demonstrated the optimum 34 % increment in thermal diffusivity on 0.6
wt% addition of NPs. The highest diffusivity appeared to be 0.13 mm2/s
for optimal NePCM in comparison to base 0.09 mm2/s. Further, PCM
composite  was  prepared  by  utilizing  paraffin  with  expanded  graphite
and iron-modified graphene oxide (Fe3O2-MGO) composite. The highest
diffusivity  appeared  to  be  0.901  mm2/s  for  paraffin  with  5  wt%
expanded graphite and 1 wt% Fe3O2-MGO in comparison to 0.1 mm2/s
for base [202]. Moreover, a thermal diffusivity increment was observed
in another study by adding iron nanoparticles to paraffin. The increased
diffusivity of 0.8 mm2/s was observed in addition to 1.5 wt% addition of
nanoparticles as compared to 0.2 mm2/s of base paraffin [203]. Besides,
paraffin PCM was tested for thermal diffusivity with graphite foams (GF)
with  4  different  pore  sizes.  In  comparison  to  pure  paraffin  wax,  the
thermal  diffusivities  of  the  four  Paraffin-GF  systems  (with  values  of
24.94, 36.00, 65.84, and 74.31 mm2/s) exhibited significant increases of
190,  270,  500,  and  570  times,  correspondingly.  The  dispersion  of
paraffin  wax  inside  the  cells  of  the  matrices  resulted  in  an  increased
surface area of contact between the paraffin wax and the walls of the GF.
The  walls  at  the  ground  floor  exhibit  a  high  thermal  conductivity,
facilitating  the  quick  movement  of  heat  throughout  the  PCM.  The
highest thermal diffusivity found for lower porosity 72.9 % GF. Hence,
the mass ratio of paraffin wax saturation in sample D (47 %) exhibited a
lower value compared to the other three samples. The incorporation of
paraffin wax into foams, together with the use of thicker graphite liga-
ments in GF composites, led to an increase in thermal diffusivity. The
pore size and thickness of the foam’s ligaments were shown to be sig-
nificant  factors  in  the  heat  transmission  process  [204].  However,  a
decrement in thermal diffusivity is observed for eutectic (palmitic-par-
affin) composite added with titanium oxide nanoparticles. The 0.5 wt%
nanoparticle added composite showed 0.20 mm2/s thermal diffusivity in
comparison to base 0.24 mm2/s [205]. Thermal diffusivity, among other
thermo-physical  parameters,  has  received  little  attention  in  the

comprehensive investigation of PCMs. Thermal diffusivity is an essential
measurement used to characterize the process of heat diffusion in the
context of heat transfer. Simply considering the latent heat capacity and
phase transition temperature is insufficient for accurately modelling the
real-world performance of PCMs or forecasting the overall improvement
in  heat  transfer  in  a  thermal  energy  storage  system.  Therefore,  more
research  studies  are  required  in  the  area  of  thermal  diffusivity  for
nanoparticle PCM.

negative consequences in terms of the thermal conductivity increase and
viscosity of NePCMs [208].

The long-term viability of PCM is contingent upon their thermal and
chemical stability, particularly in relation to the materials compatibility,
after a series of repetitive and consistent thermal cycles. The optimal
PCM, in terms of thermal stability, should exhibit minimal changes in
both  its  latent  heat  and  melting  point.  Therefore,  it  is  essential  to
guarantee the thermal stability of PCM to maintain optimal performance
of the latent heat storage system over an extended period.

5.5. Thermal stability

Introducing varying weight percentages of nanoparticles into a base
PCM might result in the formation of agglomerates. The agglomeration
phenomenon  involves  the  cohesive  binding  of  nanoparticles,  forming
disordered arrangements as they traverse the underlying substance. The
aforementioned  effect  has  significant  relevance  in  the  field  of  heat
transfer, as it has the potential to impact the improvement of the thermo-
physical characteristics of PCM over time. Therefore, the thermal sta-
bility  of  nano-enhanced  PCMs  through  several  cycles  of  melting  and
solidification is of paramount importance. Cyclic conditions might in-
fluence the dispersion of nanoparticles. Cycle stability enhancement in
PCM may be achieved by the stable and effective dispersion of nano-
particles inside the PCM matrix. To ensure the sustained effectiveness of
the  storage  unit,  it  is  essential  to  monitor  variations  in  the  thermo-
physical  characteristics  of  prospective  PCMs  over  several  charge-
discharge cycles. A PCM may be considered reliable if it demonstrates
thermal, chemical, and physical stability even after undergoing several
cycles  of  thermal  transitions.  Nevertheless,  as  a  result  of  the  funda-
mental  characteristics  of  these  substances,  PCMs  may  experience
degradation  over  a  period  of  time.  The  occurrence  of  significant  de-
teriorations  in  the  thermo-physical  characteristics  over  an  extended
period of time is considered undesirable for any PCM. Solar applications
are the most typical use of PCM-based energy storage units. At least one
melt-freeze  thermal  cycle  occurs  every  day  in  a  solar  thermal  system
with  latent  heat  storage.  This  phenomenon  might  be  regarded  as  a
typical recurring pattern.

Nevertheless, it is possible to generate a sequence of recurrent and
uniform heat cycles inside a controlled laboratory setting by using either
an  electric  hot  plate  equipped  with  a  temperature  regulating  device.
Accelerated thermal cycle studies, which are performed in a controlled
laboratory setting, include a series of thermal charge discharge cycles. A
PCM can be considered thermally stable for applications involving latent
heat storage if it exhibits minimal changes in its thermal degradation,
melting point, latent heat of fusion, and chemical structure following a
series of operational thermal cycles.

As per previous studies, the thermal properties of NePCM composites
vary  slightly  with  respect  to  thermal  charge-discharge  cycles.  For
instance, in research work [206] used thermal cycles as high as 4000 to
examine the fluctuations in thermal characteristics of 1.0 wt% of SiO2 in
myristic  acid. The  researchers demonstrated that the  phase  transition
temperature for melting and solidification exhibits a rise of 2.09 % and
1.63 %, respectively. However, it is seen that the latent heat for melting
decreases  by  about  0.89  %,  whereas  the  latent  heat  for  solidification
decreases by approximately 0.61 %. The study’s findings indicate that
the observed deviations are considered minor due to their insignificantly
low magnitudes.

Further  surface  modification  showed  better  thermal  reliability  re-
sults  as  in  the  research  study  [207]  on  A70 PCM  with  functionalized
MWCNT was applied for thermo-physical properties. The thermal sta-
bility  analysis  of  the  functionalized  composite  was  tested  after  500
thermal  cycles.  The  results  showed  that  the  nanocomposite  remained
◦
chemically stable and thermally stable until 250
C. After 500 cycles, the
latent heat enthalpy appeared to be 158 J/g compared to 159 J/g with
zero  cycles.  Further,  Surfactants  were  used  in  most  investigations  to
mitigate the challenges associated with agglomeration and sedimenta-
tion for thermal stability. The use of surfactants might potentially lead to

5.6. Density

The density of the NePCMs significantly impacts the volume of the
latent heat thermal energy storage system. This characteristic is often
overlooked in comparison to the other mentioned characteristics. The
selection of a PCM for a particular application is primarily based on its
melting temperature. However, additional properties such as the den-
sity, latent heat of fusion, thermal conductivity, thermal stability, and
minimal  volume  change  also  contribute  significantly  to  the  effective
design of a product. Consequently, it is crucial to consider these prop-
erties  in  order  to  optimize  the  design  process  [209].  Previous  re-
searchers  have  conducted  numerous  studies  on  composite  PCMs
intending to enhance the thermal conductivity of polyamide. However,
the  outcomes  of  these  studies  have  exhibited  significant  variations,
likely due to differences in the density of the composite PCM utilized.

Consequently, comparing the results across these studies has proven
challenging. The connection between thermal conductivity and density
is linear. An increase in the density of the composite material leads to a
corresponding rise in its thermal conductivity. The implications of this
discovery  are  highly  significant  in  relation  to  the  manufacturing  and
utilization  of  composite  PCMs.  When  the  compressed  density  of  the
composite PCMs falls below 0.6 g/cm3, it is seen that the phase change
can be adequately sustained within the encapsulating material, known
as  the  expanded  graphite  (EG),  without  any  significant  alteration  in
volume.  When  the  compressed  density  exceeds  0.6  g/cm3,  the  worm
structure within the EG experiences significant compression as a result
of  an  excessive  compression  force.  Hence,  a  modification  in  volume
takes place during the phase transition. At a density of 0.9 g/cm3, the
volume experiences a 66 % expansion. To ensure the suitability of the
cooling  suit  for  application,  it  is  necessary  to  consider  the  thermal
conductivity  of  the  composite  PCMs  and  the  volume  expansion  that
occurs  upon  heating.  In  order  to  meet  the  desired  requirements,  the
package density should be maintained at 0.6 cm3 [210].

The NePCM density significantly impacts the overall volume of the
latent heat thermal energy storage (LHTES) system. This parameter is
frequently overlooked in comparison to the aforementioned character-
istics. The density of the non-aqueous electrolyte polymer NePCMs was
assessed  by  Abdelrazik  et  al.  [211].  The  NePCMs  were  composed  of
paraffin and graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs), with respective base den-
sities  of  800  and  2400  kg/m3.  The  concentrations  of  GNPs  were  sys-
tematically  altered,  ranging  from  1  to  20  wt%.  The  experimental
outcomes revealed a noticeable rise in the density of the NEPCM, from
an  initial  value  of  800  kg/m3  to  a  final  value  of  923  kg/m3.  In  an
investigation conducted by Owolabi et al. [203] focused on assessing the
influence  of  adding  diverse  metal-based  nanoparticles  (namely,
aluminium, zinc, iron, and copper) at varied mass concentrations (0.5,
1.0,  and  1.5  wt%)  on  the  density  of  nanocomposites.  The  findings
demonstrated a persistent pattern across all nanocomposites, wherein an
increase in density was observed at a concentration of 1 wt%, followed
by a modest decrease in density at 1.5 wt% in comparison to the 1 wt%
concentration.  It  is  important  to  acknowledge  that  there  may  exist  a
degree of ambiguity in relation to the acquired property measurements.
In the early phases of the melting process, the solid NePCM that is in
immediate  proximity  to  the  heated  aluminium  container  wall  experi-
ences a shift from a solid state to a liquid state. As the process of melting
advances, the density of NePCMs diminishes as a result of the transition

Z. Said et al.

in phase, resulting in a general drop in density. The decrease in density
leads to the upward movement of liquid NePCMs within the container,
driven  by  buoyant  forces.  The  molten  NePCM  experiences  buoyant
forces,  resulting  in  upward  displacement  within  the  container.  The
aforementioned  movement  engenders  a  discernible  pattern  of  fluid
motion  that  assumes  a  pivotal  function  in  the  process  of  mixing  and
facilitating  the  effective  dispersion  of  thermal  energy  inside  the  sub-
stance.  The  ascent  of  the  molten  NePCM  facilitates  thermal  energy
transportation,  hence  facilitating  the  homogenization  of  temperature
inside  the  material  and  enhancing  the  heat  transfer  process.  The  sig-
nificance of this phenomenon lies in its ability to optimize the overall
performance of PCMs and enhance their capacities in storing thermal
energy [212]. In brief, the investigation of density in PCMs augmented
with nanoparticles provides valuable insights into the properties of these
materials  during  phase  transitions,  elucidating  their  buoyancy-driven
movement and mechanisms of heat redistribution.

5.7. Specific heat

The storage capacity of LHTES is dependent upon the combined in-
fluence of latent heat and specific heat capacity. In this manner, the PCM
is  expected  to  exhibit  a  substantial  specific  capacity  and  latent  heat
value. The specific heat capacity (Cp) is an intrinsic characteristic of a
substance that quantifies the amount of energy required to increase the
◦
C. The concept can
temperature of a given quantity of the material by 1
be seen as a quantitative representation of the degree to which a sub-
stance  exhibits  resistance  to  alterations  in  temperature.  In  a  separate
study,  Ferrer  et  al.  [213]  proposed  five  empirical  equations  for  the
computation  of  organic  PCM’s  Cp,  specifically  focusing on  fatty  acids
and  paraffin.  The  DSC  areas  approach  was  employed  to  produce  two
empirical equations for the calculation of viscosity and Cp for the entire
paraffin PCM group, as well as three additional equations for the fatty
acid PCM group. However, it should be noted that the empirical equa-
tions in question may yield a margin of error of approximately 4 % when
applied to a different set of PCMs. This suggests that further research is
needed to fully understand and highlight the existing research gaps and
the need for further investigation in this area. In a study of relevance,
Shin and Banerjee [214] incorporated silica nanoparticles into a eutectic
solution,  including  lithium  carbonate  and  potassium  carbonate.  By
employing this methodology, a significant enhancement in the specific
heat capacity of the resultant nanofluid was attained, with gains ranging
from 19 % to 24 %. Significantly, the measurements in question had a
level of uncertainty that stayed consistently below 5 %. The aforemen-
tioned eutectic PCMs were utilized in this novel methodology, demon-
strating  the  potential  to  enhance  TES  capabilities  by  strategically
incorporating  nanoparticles  into  existing  solutions.  Nevertheless,
exploring the inorganic group’s potential for boosting specific heat ca-
pacity has been relatively limited, presenting an opportunity for further
investigations and prospective breakthroughs.

However,  limited  research  has  been  conducted  on  the  impact  of
including  nano  additives  on  the  specific  heat  capacity  of  materials.
Within the realm of literature, many researchers have presented diver-
gent results about the alteration of specific heat in the context of NePCM.
The  specific  heat  of  the  nanoparticles  mostly  influences  the  observed
specific heat. When nanoparticles with a lower specific heat than the
PCM are used, the resultant NePCM exhibits a decreased specific heat.
Conversely, when nanoparticles with a larger specific heat than the PCM
are used, the NePCM demonstrates an increased specific heat [7].

This section has comprehensively examined the influence of nano-
particles on the thermophysical properties of PCMs. The integration of
nanoparticles into PCMs has been shown to significantly modify their
characteristics, enhancing their suitability for various applications. Key
findings include:

• Melting point: The addition of nanoparticles can slightly alter the
melting  temperature  of  PCMs.  This  change  is  influenced  by  the

interaction  between  the  nanoparticles  and  the  PCM  matrix,  and
while the variations are generally minor, they are crucial for specific
applications.

• Thermal conductivity: The introduction of nanoparticles, particu-
larly those with high thermal conductivity like carbon nanotubes or
graphene, greatly enhances the thermal conductivity of PCMs. This
improvement is dependent on factors such as nanoparticle concen-
tration, size, shape, and distribution within the PCM.

• Latent heat capacity: The addition of nanoparticles can affect the
latent heat capacity of PCMs. While some studies show a decrease in
latent heat with nanoparticle integration, others indicate an increase,
influenced by the type and concentration of nanoparticles.

• Thermal  diffusivity:  Incorporating  nanoparticles  into  PCMs  can
significantly  improve  their  thermal  diffusivity,  which  is  vital  for
efficient heat transfer during the phase change process. The extent of
this  improvement  varies  with  the  type  of  nanoparticles  used  and
their concentration in the PCM.

• Thermal  stability:  The  stability  of  nano-enhanced  PCMs  over
several thermal cycles is a critical factor. Studies have shown that
nanoparticle integration can enhance the thermal stability of PCMs,
maintaining their thermophysical properties over multiple heating
and cooling cycles.

• Density: The addition of nanoparticles affects the density of PCMs,
which  is  essential  for  determining  the  volume  requirements  of
thermal energy storage systems. The impact on density depends on
the type and amount of nanoparticles used.

• Specific heat: The specific heat capacity of PCMs can be influenced
by  including nanoparticles.  This property is  crucial for  optimizing
the storage capacity of latent heat thermal energy storage systems.

The findings from various studies underscore the potential of nano-
particles  to  enhance  the  PCMs  performance  significantly.  These  en-
hancements make PCMs more efficient for thermal energy storage and
management  and  expand  their  applicability  in  various  fields.  Future
research should continue exploring nanoparticle integration optimiza-
tion  to  balance  improvements  in  thermal  conductivity  with  other
essential properties like latent heat capacity and thermal stability.

6. Applications of nanoparticles enhanced phase change
materials

In recent years, the NePCMs have gained considerable interest due to
their  potential  utilization  in  different  fields.  NePCMs  can  absorb  and
release significant quantities of thermal energy during the phase tran-
sition  process.  The  nanoparticles  addition  in  PCM  leads  to  primarily
enhance  their  thermal  conductivity,  heat  transfer  rate,  and  thermal
energy storage (TES) capacity, which make them suitable candidates to
be used in different applications like PV/T, Battery thermal management
systems, Building applications, HVAC system, solar cooker, textile in-
dustries, food industries and electronics industries, etc. Fig. 9 consoli-
dates the wide spread thermal regulation application that are discussed
elaboratively. In general, PCMs are integrated with the TES system to
facilitate thermal regulation and comfort and for thermal management.
Integration of PCM with a TES system requires careful consideration of
factors  such  as  material  compatibility,  heat  transfer  efficiency,  and
system design. It is possible to enhance the system’s overall performance
and energy efficiency by selecting the appropriate technique and ma-
terials. Several methods have been employed to integrate PCM with TES.
Most common approach is to incorporate PCM into the storage medium
system itself. This can be achieved by a) encapsulating the PCM within
microcapsules or by b) impregnating it into porous structures. In regard
to  the  former  technique,  PCMs  are  enclosed  within  small  capsules,
typically  made  of  a  polymeric  shell.  These  capsules  can  then  be
dispersed  within  the  storage  medium,  allowing  for  the  efficient  ab-
sorption  and  release  of  thermal  energy  during  the  phase  transition
process.  This  technique  offers  advantages  such  as  enhanced  heat

transfer, phase separation prevention, and increased PCM stability.

On  the  other  hand,  impregnation,  involves  saturating  a  porous
structure, such as a matrix of solid particles or fibers, with PCM. This
allows for a greater surface area for heat transfer and can improve the
thermal  conductivity  of  the  storage  medium.  The  choice  of  porous
structure  and  PCM  depends  on  factors  such  as  the  desired  operating
temperature range, heat transfer requirements, and material compati-
bility. Furthermore, PCMs are also integrated with the TES system via
use of composite materials as far as building application is concerned.
This involves embedding the PCM within a matrix material, such as a
polymer  or  a  cementitious  material.  These  composites  can  then  be
shaped into various forms, such as panels or tiles, and integrated into the
TES system.

6.1. Photovoltaic thermal system (PVT)

The photovoltaic (PV) cells convert solar irradiance into electricity

directly. The PV cell typically converts around 20 % of solar irradiance
into electricity [242], while the rest of solar irradiance is converted into
heat, which increases the PV cell temperature and affects the cell’s ef-
ficiency  adversely  [243].  Thus,  photovoltaic/thermal  systems  can  be
used instead of PV systems.

alone to utilize waste heat into useful energy, ultimately improving
overall efficiency and reducing materials costs. The heat energy from PV
cells is recovered through cooling fluid mediums like water, nanofluid,
PCM, NePCM, etc.

In recent years, NePCMs integration to PV cells gained popularity as
an  effective  cooling  method  supported  by  numerous  numerical  and
experimental research studies in this area, such as the work by Waeli
et  al.  [243],  which  solved  a  mathematical  model  for  the  nano-
fluid/NePCM PVT system and validated it through experimental results.
The comparison results showed 5.05 % and 3.72 % deviation in thermal
◦
and electrical efficiencies with 60.45
C peak temperature of the system.
Also, the overall efficiency of the system is enhanced to 85.7 %. Also,

cooling in PVT systems is crucial to optimize efficiency, improve per-
formance,  increase  longevity,  manage  temperatures,  and  ensure  reli-
ability.  Abdollahi  and  Rahimi  [246]  further  underscored  this
importance  by  introducing  a  new  PV  passive  cooling  technique  by
integrating  NePCM  (0.009  w/w  Boehmite  nanopowder,  18  wt%  sun-
flower oil and 82 wt% coconut oil) along with circulating cooling water
and zig-zag geometry of PCM container for heat transfer enhancement.
The results showed that mixing PCM with Boehmite nanopowder leads
to an increase in efficiency enhancement. Specifically, at radiation in-
tensities of 410, 530, and 690 W/m2, the efficiency enhancement rea-
ches  44.74  %,  46.63  %,  and  48.23  %,  respectively.  In  a  separate
investigation conducted by Salem et al. [247] the cooling performance
of PV modules was investigated by integrating Al2O3/PCM mixture of
different nanoparticle concentrations with recirculating water of 0–5.31
kg/s m2 of mass flux. The results found an increment in thermal as well
as exergy efficiency with water flow rate. At ʎPCM  = 0 %, the average
thermal efficiency rises from 44.2 % to 68.4 % as the water flow rate
increases from 0.25 to 1.0 lpm. Similarly, at ʎPCM = 75 %, the thermal
efficiency increases from 27.2 % to 48.6 % as the water flow rate goes
from  0.25  to  1.0  lpm  as  shown  in  Fig.  10.  Under  similar  water  flow
conditions,  the  exergy  efficiency  increases  from  12.9  %  to  13.6  %  at
ʎPCM = 0 %. This represents an augmentation in exergy efficiency of 44.2
% and 52.3 % compared to the reference cell (ɳo, ex = 8.9 %).

Furthermore,  to  explore  the  avenues  for  efficiency  enhancement,
Bassam et al. [249] analysed a PVT system integrated with NePCMs (1
wt%  SiC  nanoparticles)  and  twisted  tape  micro-fins  tubes  with  circu-
lated nanofluid (SiC/water). The system achieves an electrical efficiency
of 10.8 % while attaining a maximum thermal efficiency of 83.3 %. The
experimental  system  achieved  a  44.5  %  augmentation  in  electrical
power compared to the base system. Shakibi et al. [248] performed a
techno-economic  study  of  PVT  systems  integrated  with  NePCMs
(nano-SiC/paraffin  wax)  and  recirculated  SiC/water  nanofluid,  as
shown in Fig. 11. This system’s thermal and electrical efficiency was 72
%  and  13.7  %,  respectively,  with  0.125  $/kWh  electricity  cost  and  a

payback period of 5–6 years. Al-Waeli et al. [250] investigated a novel
PVT system consisting of a finned collector and filled with NePCM as an
energy  storage  medium.  The  optimization  analysis  of  this  system  in-
dicates  a  maximum  range  of  thermal  efficiency  of  10–24  %  at  direct
normal irradiance (DNI) of more than 950 W/m2 and wind speed of less
than 2 m/s. The optimum electrical efficiency from the system obtained
was  13.92  %.  In  another  study,  Al-Waeli  et  al.  [251]  explored  the
cooling performance of a NePCM integrated PVT system and a cooling
nanofluid circulation system with a flow rate of 0.17 kg/s. The results
showed  that the  proposed PVT/NePCM/nanofluid system  successfully
◦
reduced the PV cell temperature by 30
C during the peak solar radiation
period (12:30 am to 1:30 pm). This reduction had a positive impact on
the  system’s  performance.  The  system  achieved  significant  improve-
ments compared to the baseline measurements. The open circuit voltage
witnessed a significant rise, increasing from the range of 11–13 to 20–21
V.  Moreover,  the  power  output  experienced  a  substantial  increase,
growing from 61.1 to 120.7 W. Simultaneously, the electrical efficiency
demonstrated notable improvement, escalating from 7.1 % to 13.7 %.
Furthermore, the  system demonstrated efficient utilization of thermal
energy, achieving a thermal efficiency of 72 %.

6.2. Battery thermal management system (BTMS)

The operation of  a  typical electric vehicle  involves a  battery  pack
stack  comprising  multiple  batteries  connected  in  series  and  parallel
combinations. These batteries generate significant heat energy due to
ongoing  electrochemical  and  thermal  processes.  Maintaining  a  safe
◦
working temperature range of 25–55
C is crucial for Li-ion batteries, as
exceeding  this  limit  can  drastically  reduce  lifetime  and  charging  ca-
pacity  [252].  Integration  of  NePCM  with  battery  facilitates  with  a)
reduced  overheating  risk;  b)  improved  battery  performance,  and  c)
enhanced safety [253]to the operation environment and to the system.
In their numerical study, Talele and Zhao et al. [254] investigated
the passive thermal performance of 4S4P configured high voltage li-ion

based 18,650 NMC battery pack with 14.2 network voltage and 12Ah
capacity and compared the thermal performance of a battery pack sys-
tem utilizing Al2O3/PCM and conventional PCM. Based on their anal-
ysis, they concluded that NePCMs enhance the thermal effectiveness of
the battery pack with enhanced heat absorbing ability from the source
before the premature liquidious stage. The effectiveness of batteries is
further  enhanced  when  utilizing  NePCMs.  Experimental  results
demonstrate that configuring a battery pack with such materials leads to
a greater delay in temperature changes. John et al. [255] conducted a
numerical  investigation  to  assess  the  cooling  performance  of  stearic
acid-based  BTMS.  This  evaluation  involved  integrating  CuO  nano-
particles  with  varying  thicknesses  ranging  from  2  to  12  nm.  Further-
more,  Sabbhah  et  al.  [256]  modeled  a  hybrid  BTMS  to  enhance  the
thermal  performance  of  68  lithium-ion  batteries  (LiIB)  arranged  in  a
4S5P configuration. Within this setup, four cells were situated within a
PCM-graphite composite for passive cooling, with a 3 mm gap between
them. The outcomes of the experiment indicated that the implementa-
tion of NePCMs effectively kept the maximum temperature of the LiIB

pack below 55
C, even at a high C-rate of 6.67C, while maintaining an
outlet temperature of 45
C. Jilte et al. [257] modeled a novel BTMS
system using NePCMs. The 18,650 Li-ion cells were arranged in m x n x p
formation, where m denotes the number of Li-ion cells, n denotes the
primary  container  filled  with  NePCM1  and  p  denotes  secondary
container filled with NePCM2. They compared the cooling performance
of two BTMS configurations, i.e., 7 × 7 x 1 and 7 × 1 x 1. The results
◦
showed that BTMS with 7 × 7 x 1 maintains the cell temperature at 46

Babapoor et al. [258] fabricated a lithium-ion battery simulator and
tested it by integrating carbon fiber-PCM to assess the performance of a
thermal management system. The results showed that carbon fiber with
0.46 wt% and 2 mm length provide the best thermal performance. In
their research, Anqi et al. [259] examined the impact of a combination
of  air  cooling  and  NePCMs  on  lithium-ion-based  BTMS  systems.  The
Li-ion battery (LiIB) cell was placed inside two circular and oval-shaped
NePCM  filled  containers  with  air  flows  at  a  speed  of  0.1–0.4  cm/s,
reducing the average temperature of Li-ion cells. An experimental study
was conducted by Temel et al. [260] to analyze the cooling efficiency of
a  representative  battery  pack  containing  macro/nano-enhanced  PCM.
The experiment outcomes indicated that NePCM enhanced the effective
protection time by 117 % at 4C compared to pure PCM. Alqaed et al.
[261] conducted a simulation study of NePCM (graphene/CaCl2.6H2O)
integrated BTMS system. The enclosure contains a triangular arrange-
ment of a LiIB pack with 12 blades. The PCM’s charging and discharging
processes are studied while maintaining a constant temperature for the
LiIBP. The results show that the melting time of NePCM is longer than
the  freezing  time.  Increasing  the  blade  length  enhances  the  NePCM’s
average temperature during melting and reduces it during freezing. A
longer blade length increases the

amount of NePCM during both processes. Ramanathan et al. [262]
examined  the  cooling  performance  of  BTMS  of  an  electric  vehicle  by
employing NePCM (CuO, Cu, MWCNT,/paraffin Wax). The simulation
study  demonstrated  the  maximum  heat  transfer  coefficient  of  27.413
W/m2⋅K at 6 vol % of MWCNT/paraffin wax NEPCM.

6.3. HVAC and building applications

The  PCMs  play  a  vital  role  in  building  applications  by  offering
multiple benefits for energy management and thermal comfort. Firstly,
PCMs enable thermal energy storage, allowing buildings to store excess
heat  during  periods  of  high  temperature  and  release  it  when  needed
[263]. This helps reduce reliance on conventional heating and cooling
systems, leading to energy savings and improved efficiency. Secondly,
PCMs  contribute  to  passive  cooling  by  absorbing  heat  during  peak
daytime temperatures and releasing it when the ambient temperature
drops,  thereby  reducing  the  cooling  load  and  enhancing  comfort.
Additionally, integrating PCMs into building materials helps maintain a

more stable indoor temperature, reduce temperature fluctuations, and
create comfortable living or working environments for occupants [264].
PCMs also facilitate the efficient utilization of renewable energy sources,
like solar power, by absorbing and releasing heat in sync with energy
demands. Overall, PCMs provide a sustainable and effective solution for
energy  storage,  passive  cooling,  and  thermal  comfort  in  buildings,
contributing to energy efficiency and enhancing occupants’ well-being
[265].  Additionally,  NePCM  is  a  better  option  than  PCM  due  to  its
enhanced thermophysical properties.

Parameshwaran  and  Kalaiselvam  [267]  performed  a  year-round
experimental study to analyze the thermal and economic performance
of  an  air  conditioning  and  ventilation  system  integrated  with  silver
nanoparticles enhanced PCM for a building application. The silver-based
NePCM  enhances  the  heat  transfer  rate  along  with  charging  and  dis-
charging cycles. Compared to conventional air conditioning systems, for
a year-round study, the present system provides 36–58 % and 24–51 %
energy savings for on-peak and daily average conditions, respectively.
The experimental results also suggest that silver-based NePCM provides
augmented overall thermal performance for this system. Sayyar et al.
[268] developed a nano-PCM composite by integrating graphite nano-
sheets into fatty acids-based PCM. This nano-PCM composite was used in
gypsum wallboards as a sandwich structure. The experimental results
demonstrate  that  using  nano-PCM  composite  in  gypsum  wallboards
causes  a  79  %  reduction  in  energy  consumption.  Remarkably,  this
reduction  was  achieved  while  effectively  maintaining  the  room  tem-
perature within the desired comfort zone. In a similar study, Biswas et al.
[266]  used  graphite  nanoplatelets/n-heptadecane  NePCM  layers  in
gypsum wallboards. The study demonstrated a significant reduction in
electricity  use  for  NePCM-based  gypsum  wallboards,  as  depicted  in
Fig. 13.

Guo  [269]  examined  the  potential  of  Al2O3/paraffin  NePCM  in
building applications. His numerical study used the enthalpy-porosity
model to demonstrate that using NePCM (90 % paraffin wax + 10 %
Al2O3) in room ceilings saves significant energy. The results showed that
◦
a room ceiling with NePCM maintains the room temperature at 26.5
C
◦
even at ambient temperature changes from 25 to 50
C. Tunçbilek et al.
[270]  investigated  the  potential  of  applying  Al2O3-based  NePCM  at
building external walls to evaluate the energy saving caused by heating.
The  experimental  results  showed  that  applying  a  3-cm  thick  layer  of
NePCM with 3.0 % nanoparticle concentration can save 1.7 % of heating
energy as well as 20.7 % of yearly energy saving. Zhou [271] integrates
PCM walls and building integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs) to provide a
dynamic platform for energy-efficient structures, as shown in Fig. 14.
The platform has several features, such as improved thermal inertia and
storage capacity, solar shading, HVAC systems powered by renewable
energy  sources,  and  thermal  regeneration  of  PCM  through  pre-  and
night-cooling.  BIPV  and  passive  PCM  wall  synergies  are  investigated,
and  adaptable  PCM  latent  heat  charging/discharging  solutions  are
suggested. The results demonstrate lowered cooling load, reduced peak
power, increased accumulated heat, increased PCM melting proportions
range, and decreased annual import prices.

Zhang  et  al.  [272]  proposed  a  2D  heat  transfer  model  utilizing
NePCM (TiO2, ZnO) for analysing the year-round thermal performance
of glazing windows. The characterization outcomes of NePCM demon-
strate the improvement in the melting and solidification process. The
results showed a peak temperature difference of around 5 K between the
inner and outer surface using NePCM. The results unequivocally estab-
lish the importance of implementing heat insulation measures for win-
dows  filled  with  PCM,  which  are  crucial  for  enhancing  the  indoor
thermal  environment.  Dong  et  al.  [273]  filled  NePCM  material  of
different  size  and  volume  concentrations  inside  the  window  unit  and
evaluated its thermal and optical performance. The results showed that
the  NePCM  reduced  the  inner  surface  temperature  of  the  window
significantly.  They  also recommended  CuO  nanoparticles with  15  nm
size  nanoparticles  and  1  %  nanoparticle  concentration  as  optimum
conditions. In their study, Kant et al. [274] addressed the decrease in

electrical conversion efficiency observed in building integrated photo-
voltaic  (BIPV)  systems  as  the  operating  temperature  rises.  They
employed NePCM to regulate and maintain the operating temperature
under  standard  test  conditions  to  mitigate  this  issue.  The  researchers
conducted  computational  fluid  dynamics  (CFD)  analysis,  considering
heat and mass transfers within a system that involved attaching NePCM
to the back of a BIPV panel. They utilized four different nanoparticles
(Al2O3, Cu, CuO, and TiO2) mixed with n-octadecane as the base PCM
material.  The  results  indicated  that  incorporating  an  appropriate
amount  of  nanoparticles  resulted  in  a  significant  reduction  in  the
operating temperature of the BIPV panel, with the maximum reduction
achieved  using  Cu  nanoparticles.  With  a  5  %  concentration  of  Cu
nanoparticles,  the  panel  temperature  remained  below  40
C  for
approximately 60 min. Harikrishnan et al. [275] examined the energy
storage  performance  of  novel  NePCM  (TiO2,  ZnO,  CuO  nanoparticles
dispersed  in  the  mixture  of  lauric  acid  and  stearic  acid  (70:30)  for
building application. Ajour et al. [276] suggested two ways to lower the
energy use of air handling units (AHUs) as shown in Fig. 15. The first
approach  entails  a  sustainable  pack  made  up  of  two  heat  exchangers
containing  phase-change  materials  (PCMHE)  and  a  ground  heat
exchanger (GHE). By including an eco-friendly pack, energy consump-
tion was cut by 4512 Wh/m2, which decreased CO2 emissions by 32 %.
The  second solution lowers  the indoor  surface  temperature by  1.3
C
during  the  hottest  month,  which  uses  PCM  to  limit  energy  exchange.
Comparing  this  method  to  buildings  without  PCM  or  the  sustainable
pack, CO2 emissions were cut by 50 %. It was discovered that the volume
fraction affected PCM’s performance, with lower volume fractions (10 %
and 20 %) showing the greatest energy savings. However, the energy
usage  was  not  considerably  affected  when  the  volume  fraction  was
above 30 %.

6.4. Solar energy application

NePCM is vital for improving solar energy applications by enhancing
thermal conductivity and heat transfer efficiency. As a result, solar en-
ergy  can  be  absorbed  and  distributed  more  quickly  and  effectively.
NePCMs can store and release thermal energy for longer periods thanks
to their increased heat storage capabilities. NePCMs can generally boost
energy  storage  effectiveness  and  system  performance,  which  is  espe-
cially advantageous for solar thermal energy systems. NePCMs also offer
improved temperature regulation, preserving ideal operating tempera-
tures and minimizing energy losses. There are various applications of
NePCM in solar thermal energy applications like solar desalination, solar
water heating, solar dryer, solar cooker, and solar air heaters.

NePCMs  significantly  improve  the  performance  of  solar  cookers.

NePCMs offer higher thermal conductivity and increased heat transfer
efficiency as a result of adding nanoparticles into PCMs. This shortens
cooking times and enhances overall performance by enabling quicker
heat absorption from sunlight and better dispersion inside the cooker.
NePCMs also have greater heat storage capabilities, allowing them to
store more energy during high solar irradiance and release it gradually
when the intensity of the sun’s rays declines. Due to this increased heat
storage  capacity,  longer  cooking  times  are  possible  without  the
requirement for constant sunshine exposure. The risk of food burning or
undercooking is decreased because of improved temperature regulation
offered by NePCMs [277]. They may also be made smaller and lighter
because of their high energy storage density, making solar cookers more
portable  and  user-friendly.  NePCMs  also  have  enhanced  temperature
stability and toughness, increasing their longevity and dependability in
solar  cooker  applications.  Papade  and  Patil  [278]  designed  a  solar
cooker integrating with NePCM by considering the cooking requirement
of a small family having 4 persons. The observation demonstrated that
200 g of rice and dal required cooking time of 17 and 20 min, respec-
tively, at day time and 19 and 22 min at night time. Palanikumar et al.
[279] examined the thermal performance of box type solar cookers by
incorporating  NePCM.  This  enhanced  solar  cooker  can  benefit  indus-
trial,  hostel,  hospital,  and  rich  and  low-income  families.  The  cooker
exhibited an industrialized thermal performance of 52.17 %. However,
when  PCM  and  nanoparticles  were  incorporated,  the  efficiency
improved significantly to 75.47 %. This resulted in an overall increase of
15.41 % in power supply efficiency during specific daylight hours.

NePCM in solar desalination systems efficiently stores and releases
thermal  energy  during  phase  transitions.  They  improve  heat  transfer,
regulate  temperature,  and  their  compact  size  allows  integration  into
portable  setups.  These  advancements  enhance  system  efficiency,  sus-
tainability, and offer a practical solution to water scarcity challenges.
Rufuss et al. [280] conducted a study to assess the performance of a solar
still  system  for  desalination  purposes.  They  integrated  three  different
nanoparticles (TiO2, CuO, and GO) into NePCM at a concentration of 0.3
wt%.  The  results  demonstrated  notable  improvements  compared  to
regular PCM, including increased thermal conductivity and decreased
melting/solidification  temperatures.  Specifically,  when  TiO2  and
CuO-based NePCM were used, there was a remarkable enhancement in
fresh water productivity by 26 % and 35 %, respectively, surpassing the
results achieved with pure PCM. Essa et al. [281] analysed a modified
stepped solar distiller by incorporating suspended trays and a parallel
cavity  filled  with  Al2O3/paraffin  mixture.  The  distiller’s  performance
was evaluated with and without an external condenser and at different
fan  speeds.  Results  showed  that  the  modified  distiller  had  superior
productivity,  with  a  40  %  improvement  compared  to  the  reference

distiller. At an optimum fan speed of 2000 rpm, a significant 55 % in-
crease  in  productivity  was  achieved.  The  average  thermal  efficiency
ranged from 46 % to 52.4 %. The modified distiller had a lower expense,
with  distilled  water  priced  at  $0.014  per  liter,  while  the  reference
distiller had a slightly higher cost of $0.015 per liter. Safaei et al. [282]
investigated the performance of a solar-driven water desalination sys-
tem by integrating graphene oxide (GO) based NePCM of 0.2–0.6 wt%.
The results showed a significant reduction in melting temperature using
NePCM  and  obtained  a  25  %  increment  in  fresh  water  productivity.
Kumar  et  al.  [283]  compared  solar  still  integrated  with  ZnO/PCM
NePCM and conventional ones. The results showed that solar still with
NePCM  (6.6  l/m2)  has  113  %  more  yield  than  the  conventional  one
(3.09 l/m2). Also, the NePCM enhanced the productivity of the solar still

system by 36 %. Abdullah et al. [284] conducted an experimental study
for performance augmentation of trays solar still. The solar still system
was integrated with CuO-based NePCM. The results showed that the tray
solar still provides 136 % augmentation in productivity when integrated
with NePCM compared to the simple one. In their study, Kabeel et al.
[285]  explored  the  application  of  NePCMs  to  enhance  potable  water
production in a tubular solar still. Three different solar still configura-
tions were examined: traditional solar still (TSS), TSS with PCM, and TSS
with NePCM. The incorporation of graphene oxide nanoparticles in the
PCM led to a 52 % improvement in thermal conductivity. Consequently,

coefficient were also significantly enhanced.

The solar water heater is another important application of solar en-
ergy, playing a vital role in harnessing solar radiation for heating water.
Solar  irradiance  reaches  the  collector  and  raises  the  temperature  of
recirculating water. Convection heat transfer helps transfer the heated
water  between  the  storage  tank  and  collector,  further  increasing  the
temperature  in  the  storage  reservoir.  PCM  assists  in  this  process  by
efficiently storing heat during the day and gradually releasing it to the
fluid in the storage tank when solar intensity is low, ensuring a more
consistent  temperature  for  enhanced  system  efficiency  [44].  Incorpo-
rating nanopowders in the PCM greatly impacts the heat transfer rate.
Kumar  and  Mylsamy  [286]  examined  the  thermal  performance  of
evacuated tube solar water heaters integrated with CeO2 based NePCM.
The results show a significant impact of NePCM integration into solar
water  heaters  as  it  enhances  the  energy  and  exergy  efficiency  of  the
system. The NePCMs with 1.0 wt% provide maximum daily energy and
exergy efficiency of 79.2 % and 5.1 %, respectively. Mandal et al. [287]
conducted an experimental study focused on nanoparticle (CuO) inte-
gration with PCM in solar water heaters. The results showed that the
solar water heater utilizing NePCMs exhibited the highest heat transfer
rate and Rayleigh number, reaching approximately 5.7 kW and 8.84 ×
107, respectively. Algarni et al. [288] investigated the thermal perfor-
mance  of  an  evacuated  tube  solar  collector  (ETSC)  by  incorporating
NePCM  as  a  thermal  booster.  The  results  showed  that  0.33  wt%  of
Cu/PCM caused a 32 % augmentation in the solar collector’s thermal
efficiency  and  provided  hot  water  of  50
C  for  2  h  longer  than  the
conventional  one.  Kumar  et  al.  [289]  explored  the  utilization  of

6.5. Electronics systems

Nano-enhanced  PCM  plays  a  significant  role  in  the  electronics  in-
dustry by enabling efficient thermal management. Incorporating nano-
particles into PCM enhances their ability to store and release thermal
energy. This technology is crucial in electronic devices, such as smart-
phones and laptops, as it helps dissipate heat generated during opera-
tion,  ensuring  optimal  performance  and  preventing  overheating,
thereby extending the lifespan of the devices.

Krishna et al. [290] investigated the thermal performance of a heat
pipe using NePCM for electronic cooling. The PCM, consisting of Tri-
cosane mixed with Al2O3 nanoparticles, demonstrates enhanced thermal
conductivity. Results show a 25.75 % decrease in evaporator tempera-
ture and a 53 % reduction in fan power compared to traditional heat
pipes. The NePCM effectively stores about 30 % of the supplied energy,
reducing fan power consumption. This research highlights the benefits
of  using  NePCM  for  efficient  electronic  cooling  applications.  Kumar
et al. [291] examined the thermal performance of a plate-type heat sink
(HS) with three configurations: HS (without PCM), PCM-HS (with PCM),
and  NePCM-HS  (with  nano-enhanced  PCM).  The  results  showed  that
NePCM delayed getting the reference temperature by 23 min at a power
output of 4000 W/m2, compared to PCM’s delay of 7 min. PCM is 4 min,
and NePCM is 13 min behind at 5000 W/m2. NePCM also increased heat
sink performance by 220 % over PCM, lowering the steady state tem-

study to develop an efficient thermal management system for electronic
applications. The innovative cooling module, with indirect contact be-
tween PCM and the electronic chipset, shows a significant decrease of
10
C in transient temperatures
compared to conventional heat sinks. The result showed that the chip-

time of the chipset is increased from 19 min to 34–53 min by incorpo-
rating NePCM at different concentrations, shown in Fig. 16.

Jalil  et  al.  [292]  conducted  an  experimental  study  with  different
input powers and air flow velocities to evaluate PCM’s influence on heat
sink performance, comparing cases with and without PCM. Paraffin wax
served as the PCM, placed under heat sinks of varying thickness. Results
◦
demonstrated that including PCM reduced temperatures by up to 18
C.
Additionally, adding a low percentage of nanoparticles (2 wt% Al2O3)
showed  improved  heat  sink  performance.  Furthermore,  Farzanehnia
et al. [146] investigate the cooling performance of an electronics chipset
integrating  with  NePCM  (MWCNT/PCM)  as  a  thermal  storage  system
with a heat sink. The study revealed that

Incorporating  PCM  into  the  system  significantly  increased  usage
time, up to 3.34 times longer than a pure heat sink module operating
under free convection. Higher volume fractions of PCM further extended
the usage time. NePCM outperformed PCM under free convection but
was  less  effective  under  forced  convection.  NePCM  exhibited  faster
cooling and could be enhanced with higher nanoparticle concentrations.
The effects of PCM and NePCM were more pronounced at higher input
power levels, and increasing the number of on-and-off cycles reduced
peak temperature and extended usage time.

Exploring NePCMs across various fields highlights their pivotal role
in  advancing  thermal  management  and  energy  efficiency.  Integrating
nanoparticles  into  PCMs  has  significantly  improved  thermal  conduc-
tivity, heat transfer rates, and thermal energy storage capacities. This
section encapsulates the diverse and impactful applications of NePCMs:

• Photovoltaic  thermal  systems  (PVTs):  NePCMs  have  revolution-
ized  cooling  in  photovoltaic  cells,  substantially  improving  both
thermal  and  electrical  efficiencies.  They  offer  novel  cooling  tech-
niques, making them essential for enhancing the performance and
cost-effectiveness of solar power systems.

• Battery  thermal  management  systems  (BTMS):  In  electric  vehi-
cles, NePCMs play a crucial role in maintaining optimal temperatures
for Li-ion batteries. Their ability to absorb and dissipate heat effi-
ciently  has  been  instrumental  in  prolonging  battery  life  and  pre-
venting overheating, especially under high-load conditions.

• HVAC  and  building  applications:  The  application  of  NePCMs  in
buildings contributes significantly to energy management and ther-
mal comfort. By stabilizing indoor temperatures and reducing energy
consumption, NePCMs have become a sustainable solution in mod-
ern  construction,  particularly  in  air  conditioning  systems  and
building materials.

• Solar  energy  applications:  NePCMs  enhance  the  performance  of
solar-powered  systems  like  solar  cookers,  desalination  units,  and
water heaters. Their improved heat storage and transfer capabilities
ensure more efficient and sustainable solar energy utilization.

• Electronics  systems:  NePCMs  are  key  to  effective  thermal  man-
agement in the realm of electronics. By efficiently managing the heat
generated  in  devices  such  as  smartphones  and  laptops,  they  help

devices.

The advancements in NePCM technology demonstrate a significant
stride towards more efficient, sustainable, and cost-effective solutions in
thermal management and energy utilization. Their wide-ranging appli-
cations not only underscore their versatility but also their potential to
shape a more energy-efficient future.

to their ability to store and release thermal energy during phase tran-
sitions.  These  advanced  materials  have  garnered  significant  attention
from researchers and industries alike for their promising contributions
toward enhancing energy efficiency and sustainability. As we move to-
wards a more energy-conscious and environmentally responsible future,
understanding  the  environmental  and  economic  impacts  of  NePCMs
becomes paramount. This review paper section delves into the crucial
aspects  of  assessing  how  integrating  nanomaterials  with  PCMs  in-
fluences  our  ecosystems, energy consumption  patterns,  and  economic
landscapes. By shedding light on both the positive and negative impli-
cations, this exploration offers comprehensive insights into the impli-
cations  of  adopting  NePCMs  across  different  sectors.  It  provides  a
balanced  perspective  on  their  potential  as  game-changers  in  thermal
energy  storage  and  management.  In  recent  years,  there  has  been
growing  interest  in  the  potential  of  NePCMs  to  enhance  energy  effi-
ciency and sustainability. For example, Islam et al. [293] conducted an
outdoor  experimental  investigation  of  a  PVT-NePCM  system  under
real-time Malaysian climatic conditions and found that the system raised
water outlet temperature by more than 46
C and attained a maximum
overall energy efficiency of 85 % and a peak exergy efficiency of 12 %.
Ekins and Zenghelis [294] assessed the likely economic implications of
either  current  trends  or  the  transformation  to  a  low-carbon  and
resource-efficient  economy in the year 2050. They  concluded that no
conventional cost-benefit analysis for either scenario is possible, as the
final cost of meeting various decarbonization and resource-management
pathways  depends  on  today’s  decisions  in  changing  behaviour  and
generating  innovation.  Niu  et  al.  [295]  described  the  fabrication  of
micro-nano  encapsulated  phase  change  materials  (M-NePCMs)  using
compound emulsifiers through the in-situ polymerization method. They
proposed that M-NePCMs could be useful in liquid desiccant dehumid-
ification  by  restraining  the  temperature  rise  in  the  moisture-removal
process and improving dehumidification efficiency. This section delves
into  the environmental and economic impacts  of NePCMs to enhance
energy  efficiency  and  promote  sustainability.  The  discussion  covers
their  life  cycle  assessment,  energy  efficiency  gains,  and  potential
greenhouse gas emissions reduction. The economic viability of NePCMs
will be analysed, encompassing cost savings, market opportunities, and

growth prospects in various applications. Case studies will showcase the
practical  use  of  NePCMs  in  building  insulation,  solar  energy  systems,
waste heat recovery, thermal management of electronics, refrigeration,
grid-scale energy storage, building climate control, textiles, and trans-
portation,  highlighting  their  specific  environmental  and  economic
benefits.  Fig.  17  depicts  a  flowchart  outlining  the  categorization  of
NePCM  according  to  the  environmental  and  economic  aspects.  Chal-
lenges and limitations will be addressed, including technological bar-
riers,  economic  challenges,  and  environmental  considerations,
emphasizing  the  need  for  regulatory  and  policy  support.  The  section
concludes with future perspectives and recommendations for NePCMs,
exploring  promising  research  directions,  sustainable  design  consider-
ations, and potential policy interventions to drive widespread adoption.

7.1. Environmental impacts of NePCM

7.1.1. Energy efficiency and reduced emissions

The quest for improved energy efficiency and reduced emissions has
driven the growing interest in NePCMs across various applications. The
integration of nanoparticles with PCMs has shown promising results in
enhancing  energy  storage  and  management  capabilities.  NePCMs
possess higher thermal conductivities than traditional PCMs, enabling
faster heat transfer during phase transitions and enhancing overall sys-
tem efficiency. Critically, NePCMs offer substantial benefits in thermal
energy storage systems, such as solar energy applications and waste heat
recovery. In solar energy systems, NePCMs can significantly improve the
overall performance of solar collectors [286], leading to increased en-
ergy harvesting and greater energy conversion efficiency. The ability to
store and release energy during phase transitions ensures a steady and
stable  energy  supply,  reducing  dependence  on  grid  power  and  fossil
fuels. A schematic flowchart representation highlighting the economic
and environmental aspects of solar PVT with NePCM has been shown in
Fig. 18a.

Moreover, NePCMs have demonstrated the potential to revolutionize
waste heat recovery processes [296]. By effectively capturing and stor-
ing waste heat during high-temperature industrial operations, NePCMs
offer the opportunity to optimize energy utilization and reduce energy

wastage,  thereby  contributing  to  substantial  energy  savings  and  a
decline in greenhouse gas emissions. Despite these promising attributes,
a critical assessment of NePCMs is necessary to identify potential chal-
lenges and limitations. One key concern is the overall sustainability and
synthesis  and  NePCM
environmental
manufacturing processes. The energy and resource-intensive nature of
nanoparticle production may offset some of the energy efficiency gains
achieved  during  NePCM  application,  leading  to  a  net  environmental
burden. Furthermore, while NePCMs show promise in enhancing energy
efficiency,  their  long-term  performance  and  durability  in  real-world
applications need careful scrutiny. Factors such as nanoparticle aggre-
gation, phase separation, and material degradation over multiple phase
change  cycles  could  potentially  compromise  the  effectiveness  of
NePCMs  and  raise  questions  about  their  reliability  and  economic
viability.

7.1.2. Resource utilization and waste generation

Resource  utilization  and  waste  generation  are  critical  aspects  to
consider in the context of NePCMs. The production of NePCMs involves
acquiring raw materials and synthesizing nanoparticles, which can have
significant resource implications. Reji et al. [38] conducted a life cycle
assessment of NePCM production, highlighting the importance of sus-
tainable  nanoparticle  materials  and  synthesis  methods  to  minimize
resource  depletion.  The  different  applications  of  NePCM  based  PVT
systems has been illustrated in Fig. 18b. Additionally, Tyagi et al. [297]
investigated the application of NePCMs in building insulation and en-
ergy storage systems, emphasizing the need for efficient encapsulation
techniques to reduce material waste during manufacturing.

Moreover, the end-of-life stage of NePCMs needs careful consider-
ation  to  ensure  responsible  waste  management.  As  NePCMs  become
more prevalent  in various applications, proper recycling and  disposal
methods  will  be  crucial  to  prevent  environmental  contamination  and
maximize  resource  recovery.  The  works  by  Okonkwo  et  al.  [298]
emphasize the significance of sustainable practices to minimize resource

depletion and material waste. These considerations are vital to ensure
the  long-term  sustainability  and  environmental  responsibility  of
NePCMs, which will be further explored in the subsequent sections.

7.1.3. Durability and long-term sustainability

Durability and long-term sustainability are vital considerations when
evaluating  the  environmental  impacts  of  NePCMs.  As  NePCMs  find
increasing applications in various sectors, assessing their potential ef-
fects  on  the  environment  over  extended  periods  is  essential.  One  key
aspect of durability pertains to the stability of nanoparticles within the
NePCM  matrix.  The  release  of  nanoparticles  during  the  life  cycle  of
NePCMs  can  raise  concerns  about  potential  environmental  hazards.
Careful investigation is needed to understand the fate of nanoparticles
and their potential impacts on ecosystems and human health. Research
by  Martín  et  al.  [97]  highlighted  the  importance  of  studying  the
long-term behaviour of NePCMs to ensure the retention of nanoparticle
properties  and  mitigate  potential  environmental  risks.  Long-term  sus-
tainability  encompasses  the  capacity  of  NePCMs  to  maintain  their
effectiveness  and  functionality  over  extended  operational  periods.
NePCMs  integrated  into  thermal  energy  storage  systems  or  building
insulation should demonstrate robust performance over multiple phase
change cycles. Amidu et al. [299] emphasized the need to examine the
thermal  stability  of  NePCMs,  especially  in  high-temperature  applica-
tions, to ensure continuous and efficient energy storage without degra-
dation or material deterioration.

Furthermore, evaluating the environmental impacts of NePCMs re-
quires  a  life  cycle  perspective,  encompassing  resource  consumption,
energy usage, and waste generation during their entire life cycle. Sus-
tainable manufacturing processes and responsible end-of-life strategies
are  essential  to  minimize  the  environmental  footprint  of  NePCM  pro-
duction and application. Previous works, such as Kumar et al. [38], and
life cycle assessment, underscored the significance of adopting sustain-
able practices to reduce resource depletion and waste generation.

In conclusion, assessing the durability and long-term sustainability

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience104(2024)10116240

Z. Said et al.

of  NePCMs  is  crucial  to  understanding  their  environmental  impacts.
Venkateshwar  et  al.  [300]  investigated  nanoparticle  stability,  and  Li
et al. [301] explored the thermal performance essential for ensuring the
safe and effective application of NePCMs. By addressing these critical
aspects, NePCMs can be harnessed as environmentally responsible so-
lutions for energy storage and thermal management applications.

7.2. Economic impacts of NePCM

7.2.1. Cost-effectiveness of NePCM implementation

The economic implications of NePCMs play a pivotal role in deter-
mining their viability and widespread adoption in various applications.
Evaluating the cost-effectiveness of NePCM implementation is essential
to understand the potential financial benefits and challenges associated
with their use. NePCMs offer unique advantages in enhancing energy
efficiency  and  thermal  management,  but  their  initial  implementation
costs  may  vary  depending  on  the  specific  application  and  scale.  For
example, the upfront investment in NePCMs might be higher than that of
traditional materials when building insulation and energy storage sys-
tems. A setup demonstrating the use of NePCM for building energy ef-
ficiency  combined  with  a  solar  water  heating  system  is  shown  in
Fig.  18c.  However,  research  by  Sharma  et  al.  [96]  on  cost-benefit
analysis  demonstrated  that  the  long-term  cost  savings  from  reduced
energy consumption could offset the initial investment, making NePCMs
financially viable over time.

Similarly, in industrial waste heat recovery applications, integrating
NePCMs  may  require  capital  investment  in  system  modifications.
However,  the increased energy recovery and  reduced energy wastage
can lead to significant operational cost savings, as observed in the re-
view  by  Ref.  [304].  This  indicates  the  potential  cost-effectiveness  of
NePCM implementation in energy-intensive industries.

Furthermore, economic benefits arise from using NePCMs efficiently
in refrigeration and cooling systems. Sundaram et al. [305] found that
NePCMs  exhibited  superior  cooling  efficiency,  reducing  energy  con-
sumption  in  refrigeration  applications.  The  resulting  cost  savings  in
energy expenses can contribute to cost-effectiveness in the long run. To
maximize  the  cost-effectiveness  of  NePCM  deployment,  strategic  de-
cisions should be made regarding selecting appropriate NePCM formu-
lations,  encapsulation  techniques,  and  system  designs.  Integrating
NePCMs  in  applications  with  high  energy  consumption  and  thermal
management  requirements  can  yield  the  most  significant  economic
benefits.  Understanding  the  cost-effectiveness  of  NePCM  implementa-
tion  is  crucial  for  assessing  their  economic  feasibility  and  market
competitiveness.  Research  by  Abdelkareem  et  al.  [306],  and  Mourad
et al. [307] indicates that while the upfront costs of NePCMs may vary,
their long-term cost savings through improved energy efficiency make
them economically viable in various applications. Careful planning and
optimization of NePCM integration can ensure their successful deploy-
ment  as  cost-effective
thermal
management.

7.2.2. Economic viability in various applications

The economic viability of NePCMs extends across a wide range of
applications,  making  them  viable  options  for  diverse  industries  and
sectors. In building insulation and energy storage applications, NePCMs
offer  potential  cost  savings  in  the  long  term  due  to  their  ability  to
regulate  indoor  temperatures  efficiently.  Studies  by  Parameshwaran
et al. [308] demonstrated that NePCM integration in building envelopes
reduced  the  need  for  continuous  heating  and  cooling,  leading  to
decreased  energy  consumption  and  lower  utility  costs.  As  a  result,
NePCMs  present  a  cost-effective  solution  for  energy-efficient  building
climate control. Moreover, NePCMs contribute to economic viability in
solar energy systems by increasing energy harvesting efficiency. Islam
et  al.  [293]  conducted  experiments  on  PVT-NePCM  systems  and  re-
ported significantly higher energy conversion efficiency than traditional
systems. The improved energy yield from solar collectors translates to

reduced reliance on grid power and increased savings in electricity costs,
making NePCMs economically viable for solar energy applications. In
industrial  settings,  NePCMs  demonstrate  economic  benefits  in  waste
heat recovery applications. Soni et al. [309] investigated NePCM inte-
gration for industrial waste heat capture, leading to enhanced energy
recovery  and  reduced  energy  wastage.  By  converting  waste  heat  into
useable energy, NePCMs offer substantial cost savings by reducing the
need for additional heating or cooling systems.

Additionally,  NePCMs’  economic  viability  extends  to  refrigeration
and cooling applications. Bhattad et al. [310] found that NePCMs dis-
played  superior  cooling  efficiency,  reducing  energy  consumption  in
refrigeration  systems.  The  reduced  energy  costs  make  NePCMs  a
in
cost-effective  alternative  for  cooling  applications,  especially
energy-intensive  sectors.  Fig.  18d  shows  the  environmental  and  eco-
nomic benefits of using NePCM for battery thermal management.

Furthermore,  Table  6  summarizes  the  investigation  on  NePCM,
focusing  on  environmental  and  economic  impacts.  The  economic
viability of NePCMs lies in their ability to optimize energy utilization,
reduce  operating  costs,  and  enhance  energy  efficiency  in  various  ap-
plications.  These  studies  collectively  demonstrate  the  potential  eco-
nomic advantages of NePCM integration in building, solar energy, waste
heat recovery, and cooling systems. As a result, NePCMs hold promise as
economically feasible solutions to address energy challenges and pro-
mote sustainable practices across different industries.

Given the thorough investigation of the environmental and economic
consequences of NePCMs, a comparative examination of different types
of PCMs highlights the particular advantages of organic PCMs. Organic
PCMs, such as paraffins and bio-based compounds like fatty acids and
esters, have several distinct advantages over their inorganic and eutectic
equivalents. Organic PCMs are often less toxic and more biodegradable,
which  aligns  with  environmental  sustainability  goals.  Their  compati-
bility with a wide range of materials decreases the possibility of corro-
sive  reactions,  hence  increasing  system  durability  and  lowering
maintenance costs.

Economically, the relatively consistent cost of organic materials, as
opposed to the volatility seen in the prices of metals and salts used in
inorganic  PCMs,  provides  predictability  when  budgeting  for  thermal
management solutions. Furthermore, the phase stability and consistent
thermal performance of organic PCMs over multiple temperature cycles
reduce  performance degradation,  extending the life of energy storage
devices without the need for regular replacements or upgrades.

Furthermore,  organic  PCMs’  inherent  properties,  such  as  non-
corrosion and the lack of phase separation, contribute to their superi-
ority  in  applications  requiring  long-term  thermal  dependability  and
safety.  Combining  nanotechnology  with  organic  PCMs  (NePCMs)  has
increased thermal conductivity and heat transfer efficiency while being
environmentally  and  economically  viable.  This  comparative  research
demonstrates  that  organic  PCMs,  particularly  when  augmented  with
nanomaterials,  provide  an  optimal  balance  of  environmental  friendli-
ness,  economic  feasibility,  and  technical  supremacy.  As  the  energy
sector  transitions  to  more  sustainable  and  effective  thermal  manage-
ment  strategies,  organic  NePCMs  will  likely  play  an  increasingly
important role.

In  summary,  the  integration  of  NePCMs  presents  a  transformative
opportunity in the realms of energy efficiency, sustainability, and eco-
nomic viability. This section has extensively explored the environmental
and economic implications of NePCMs, shedding light on their potential
as innovative solutions in various applications. Key insights include:

a)  Environmental impact:

• Energy efficiency and reduced emissions: NePCMs demonstrate
enhanced energy storage and management capabilities, leading to
significant  energy  savings  and  reductions  in  greenhouse  gas
emissions.  Their  application  in  solar  energy  systems  and  waste
heat recovery exemplifies this advantage.

8. Role of artificial intelligence in nanoparticle enhanced phase
change materials

AI has tremendous potential for enhancing NePCM applications. AI
can  be  implemented  in  various  ways  to  enhance  NePCM  system’s
effectiveness. Starting with material design and optimization, AI can be
helpful. AI algorithms can identify patterns and correlations by studying
extensive  datasets  of  material  properties,  nanoparticle  features,  and
phase transition behaviours. In order to obtain desirable thermal char-
acteristics and phase change temperatures in the NePCM, this informa-
tion  can
influence  the  choice  of  suitable  nanoparticles,  their
concentrations,  and  other  factors.  To  address  this,  Sayed  et  al.  [321]
introduced an AI system that combines adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference
system  (ANFIS)  modelling  with  particle  swarm  optimization  (PSO)
techniques. This innovative approach aims to optimize the energy and
exergy  efficiency  of  a  Photovoltaic-Thermal  (PVT)  system  integrated
with NePCM, ensuring optimal performance and thermal management.
The model considered four operating factors as variables: the thickness
of the PCM layer, the mass flow rate of the heat transfer fluid, and the
mass fraction of nanoparticles in both the PCM and the nanofluid. The
results  showed  that  the  proposed  AI  model  at  optimum  variable  pa-
rameters provides 7.94 % and 1.36 % hike in energy and exergy effi-
ciency. Kottala et al. [322] employed three distinct machine learning
models  to  evaluate  the  activation  energies  of  NePCM  and  pure  PCM,

aiming to compare their thermal stability. The findings demonstrated
that the NePCM sample exhibited both chemical and thermal stability.
Furthermore,  several  machine  learning  models,  including  artificial
neural networks, linear regression, support vector regression, random
forest, and Gaussian process regression, were developed to forecast the
performance of the selected PCM samples under heat conditions. These
models proved to be highly accurate in predicting the behaviour of PCM
samples based on the experimental TGA dataset, encompassing various
operational settings. Liu et al. [323] investigated the effect of a battery
pack made up of three lithium-ion battery cells being surrounded by an
elliptical chamber filled with PCM. Artificial neural networks and the
finite element method are used in numerical simulations to show how
accurate  the  network  predictions  are.  The  results  showed  a  shorter
freezing time for a smaller PCM compartment. Mainly after 3000 s, the
left battery cell had lower temperatures than the middle and right bat-
teries, shown in Fig. 19.

Farahani et al. [324] explored the potential utilization of NePCM to
examine the thermal performance of microchannel heat sinks (MCHS).
The  study  considers  various  factors  such  as  different  types  of  PCM,
porous medium properties (porosity coefficient, Darcy number, material
type),  and  the  use  of  porous  foam  gradients.  The  numerical  analysis
employs  the  finite  volume  method  to  estimate  thermal  performance
enhancement, utilizing advanced techniques like the Group Method of
Data Handling (GMDH) and multivariate polynomial regression (MPR).
Karaagac  et  al.  [325]  carried  out  the  thermodynamics  analysis  of  a

concentrated photovoltaic-thermal solar dryer by

utilizing  Al2O3-paraffin  wax  based  NePCM  and  predicting  various
drying  parameters  using  machine  learning  algorithms,  i.e.,  ANN  and
SVM.  The  results  demonstrate  the  electrical  efficiency  ranging  from
10.82 % to 11.32 %, with a calculated drying rate of 0.436 g matter/g.
Additionally, the system exhibits an overall thermal efficiency of 20 %
and  an  exergy  efficiency of  8  %.  Also,  the  study  evaluates prediction
capabilities by comparing results from Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
and  SVM  algorithms  using  four  metrics,  indicating  their  successful
prediction of drying parameters. Al-Waeli et al. [326] introduce and test
a PV/T system with three cooling methods: water, phase change mate-
rial (PCM), and PCM/nano-SiC nanofluid, and performance is compared
with conventional PV. The results show that nano-PCM and nanofluid
enhance electrical current from 3.69 A to 4.04 A and electrical efficiency
from 8.07 % to  13.32 % compared to  conventional PV.  Furthermore,
three  ANN  methods  (MLP,  SOFM,  SVM)  are  applied  to  experimental
data,  showing  good  agreement  between  network  output  and  experi-
mental results. Taheri et al. [327] developed the thermal conductivity
model  of  different  carbon  based  NePCM  (like  SWCNT,  MWCNT,  gra-
phene, and graphite) using ANN and response surface method (RSM). A
total  482  experimental  samples  were  collected,  considering  six  input
parameters, including temperature, mass fractions, sizes, thermal con-
ductivities of PCMs and nanoparticles, and the phase of PCM. The ANN

layer  of  eight  neurons  and  the  Levenberg–Marquardt

AI  holds  promise  in  modeling the  behaviour  of  NePCMs.  Machine

empower  designers to  anticipate  the  performance  of NePCM  systems,
optimize their efficiency, and assess their suitability for specific appli-
cations. Kottala et al. [328] examined the thermophysical properties of a
binary eutectic PCM salt (LiNO3 + NaCl) with varying concentrations of
MWCNT. XRD and FTIR investigations confirm the physical integration
of MWCNTs without changing their chemical structure. The Kissinger
model is used to examine the phase change kinetics, and the results show
that the inclusion of MWCNTs significantly raises activation energy. The
results of experimental measurements and neural network predictions
show that the nano-PCM samples had improved thermal conductivity
(38.59  %  improvement)  and  decreased  latent  heat  storage  capacity
(14.98 % drop). The generated neural network accurately predicts DSC
values  (R2  = 0.998).  Gao  et  al.  [329]  forecasted  the  thermophysical
properties of NePCM (i.e., MWCNT, nano-graphite, graphene) using a
machine  learning  model.  The  study  employed  supervised  algorithms
such as k-nearest neighbors (KNN), Automatic relevance determination
(ARD), and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) for
regression modeling. The results were highly accurate, and the R2 values
ranged from 0.981 to 0.999, pointing to a close correlation between the
PCM characteristics and the nanoparticles.

Additionally, NePCM-based systems performance can be improved
using AI algorithms. AI can dynamically change the rates at which TES
devices  charge  and  discharge  by  examining  real-time  sensor  data,
weather predictions, and historical trends. This ensures that the NePCM
system  is  used  to  its  full  potential,  is  more  responsive  to  changing
environmental conditions, and is more energy-efficient. AI can also be
used in NePCM systems for sensing, monitoring, and defect detection. AI
systems can spot abnormalities, spot performance deviations, and pre-
dict probable system failures by continuously analysing sensor data and
comparing it with predicted behaviour. As a result, preventive mainte-
nance  is  possible,  system  reliability  is  increased,  and  downtime  is
reduced.

AI-based  control  algorithms  can  also  optimize  how  NePCM-using
devices  operate.  Real-time  data  and  variables  like  temperature,  hu-
midity, and nanoparticle dispersion are taken into account, and AI can
subsequently dynamically update operating parameters to improve the
performance of these devices. This enhances heat management, energy
efficiency, and overall system performance.

In conclusion, the application of AI in the field of NePCMs presents a
transformative  approach  towards  optimizing  their  performance  and
broadening their utility across various sectors. This section has explored
into  the  multifaceted  role  of  AI  in  enhancing  NePCM  systems,  high-
lighting several key aspects:

• Materials  design  and  optimization:  AI  algorithms  have  shown
proficiency in identifying optimal nanoparticle choices, concentra-
tions, and combinations for NePCM by analyzing extensive datasets.
This  facilitates  the  achievement  of  desired  thermal  characteristics
and efficient phase transition temperatures.

• Predictive  modeling  and  performance  forecasting:  Machine
learning  models,  including  neural  networks  and  regression  tech-
niques, have been effectively employed to predict critical properties
like  thermal  conductivity  and  latent  heat  capacity  of  NePCMs,
thereby enabling precise system design and optimization.

• Enhanced  systems  performance:  AI  has  played  a  crucial  role  in
dynamically  adjusting  the  operations  of  TES  devices,  taking  into
account real-time environmental conditions. This ensures maximal
utilization and energy efficiency of the NePCM systems.

• Sensing,  monitoring,  and  maintenance:  AI  systems  excel  in
continuous  performance  monitoring,  anomaly  detection,  and

predictive maintenance, thus enhancing the reliability and reducing
the downtime of NePCM-based applications.

• Operational  optimization:  AI-based  control  algorithms  have
demonstrated  their  ability  to  dynamically  modify  operational  pa-
rameters  of  devices  using  NePCMs.  This  leads  to  improved  heat
management  and  system  performance,  catering  to  the  varying
environmental and operational conditions.

The integration of AI in NePCMs is a testament to the synergy be-
tween  advanced  material  science  and  cutting-edge  technology.  This
collaboration  not  only  enhances  the  effectiveness  of  NePCMs  in  their
traditional roles but also paves the way for innovative applications in
diverse  fields.  From  solar  energy  systems  to  industrial  waste  heat  re-
covery and beyond, AI-enhanced NePCMs are setting a new standard for
efficiency and sustainability.

Looking  towards  the  future,  AI’s  potential  in  revolutionizing  the
NePCMs field is immense. Continuous research and development in this
area are expected to yield even more sophisticated AI models and al-
gorithms,  further  enhancing  the  capabilities  and  applications  of
NePCMs. The synergy between AI and NePCM technology holds promise
for a more energy-efficient and sustainable future, making it an exciting
area of exploration for researchers and industry practitioners alike.

9. Critical analysis of phase change material performance

Significant progress has been accomplished regarding the augmen-
tation of the overall thermal performance of a composite PCM compared
to  existing  PCMs.  In  spite  of  a  significant  rise  in  several  publications
published each year on enhancing the thermal conductivity of PCMs, no
studies have attempted to compile the findings of these publications to
perform a broad critical analysis. The process of making such a com-
parison is rigorous since it needs to take several crucial characteristics,
namely the type of PCM, the thermal conductivity, the amounts of latent
heat,  melting  point,  filler  loading,  and  the  percentage  change  in  the
thermal  properties  of  the  PCM. These  factors are  significant  in  deter-
mining whether it will be feasible to use PCM composites in TES systems
in the foreseeable future. The temperature at which melting occurs (Tm),
the latent heat of melting (Hm), and thermal conductivity (k) are a main
parameter of performance that are constantly discussed in the literature.
The  composite’s  inherent  thermophysical  characteristics  may  be
measured with little difficulty. In the energy storage heat flow curves,
the buffering process of thermal spikes and huge temperature gradients
effectively  requires  an  enormous  amount  of  heating  and  cooling  ca-
pacity,  which  TES  systems  must  possess.  The  device’s  cooling  ability
depends  on  physical  dimensions  and  operating  environment.  Shahid
et al. [330] postulated that the problem could be reduced to whether the
heat  transfer  rate  is  between  the  PCM  interface  and  the  surrounding
environment when considering a microscopic scale.

Other  metrics  outlined  previously  in  the  heat  transfer  process  are
ignored  if  thermal  conductivity  is  used  as  a  surrogate  for  cooling  ca-
pacity. Since the instantaneous rate of heat flow has intrinsic material
reliance, Shahid developed a figure of merit (FOMq) for incorporating
them in  the PCM  matrix  [331]. In their investigation of  cementitious
composites containing encapsulated PCMs, Thiele et al. [332] evaluated
material performance using a FOM technique. The ‘Energy Indicator,’ an
FOM,  is  used  to  locate  microencapsulated  PCM  composites  that  are
adequate  for  use  in  crack-resistant  concrete  and  environmentally
friendly structures. Creating such a rating aims to streamline the eval-
uation of PCMs and guide the creation of PCMs that are better suited to
use. This FOMq is a new measure that helps with design problems limited
by instantaneous cooling power rates; it does not replace the traditional
figures of merit (i.e., Tm, Hm, and Tc). In its supreme form, Shahid et al.’s
[330] figure-of-merit metric reads as in Equation (12):

The wall temperature, PCM melting temperature, and PCM-specific
latent heat of fusion are Tw, Tm, and Lw. The present investigation ad-
dresses an analytical solution of the one-region Neumann–Stefan prob-
lem  for  simplicity  exclusively.  Shao  et  al.  [333]  followed  the  FOM
technique to numerically investigate and experimentally validate PCMs
with difficult boundary circumstances without analytic solutions. This
factor  has  not  been  utilized  to  compare  and  evaluate  thermally
enhanced nanofiller PCMs. This cooling capacity FOM evaluation criti-
cally evaluates such PCMs. A comprehensive literature search identified
PCM composites, including the carbon nanofiller family (CNTs, CNFs,
GO, RGO, GNP). The experimental data from all nanocomposites using
these nanofillers was compiled and analysed. FOMq  technique is adop-
ted to evaluate the parameters for each survey dataset. To enhance and
standardize the FOMq  measurement for composites with varying filler
loadings,  it  was  normalized  based  on  the  weight  % of  the  filler as  in
Equation (15).

Equation (15)

Interesting correlations are extracted by separating the information
based  on  filler  type  and  disregarding  a  synthesis  method.  As  already
stated, a filler is typically used to build form stable PCM composites with
extreme filler loadings, which accounts for the filler’s high FOMq  and
low  FOM′q.  When  simply  the  FOMq  is  considered,  however,  graphene
nanoplatelets (GNP) also display impressive potential. While this per-
formance  is  on  par  with  EG,  it  comes  with  the  same  high  loadings
(10–20 %), as seen by the FOM′q. This work has grouped the materials
under  investigation,  including  graphene  oxide  (GO),  single-layer  gra-
phene, and graphene foams. For simplicity, although taken as a whole,
their  performance  is  not  particularly  encouraging.  Oxygen  functional
groups on GO and its derivatives may provide an answer. The thermal
characteristics  of  graphene  are  degraded  by  the  introduction of  func-
tional groups, which disrupt the hexagonal planar structure of the lat-
tice.  The  dispersion  of  GO  and  its  derivatives  in  matrices  is  well
recognized as a difficult task, particularly when considering the addi-
tional  challenge  of  maintaining  stability  across  many  heating  and
cooling  cycles  unless  it  is  immobilized  inside  three-dimensional  (3D)
structured  formations.  When  considering  carbon-based  fillers,  the
argument  for  carbon  nanotubes  (CNTs)  was  the  strongest  (for  conve-
nience,  we  also  included  carbon  nanofibers  (CNFs)  in  this  category).
These nanoscale fibrous nanofillers exhibited the lowest FOMq of any in
its  league  yet  the  highest  FOM’q  measurements.  The  CNT  category’s
distinctive structural structure stands out most visibly compared to other
fillers.  CNTs  are  the  only  non-planar  nanofillers;  all  the  others  have
thickness and low aspect ratios as their defining characteristics. Because
of their tubular shape and high aspect ratio, they can efficiently perco-
late the matrix in axial and radial directions under relatively light loads.
The excellent thermal characteristics of boron nitride composites have
been investigated as fillers for PCM nanocomposites.

Moreover,  their  composites  exhibit  execution  on  par  with  other
nanofillers,  yet  their  FOM’q  is  lower  than  that  of  their  competitors.
However, due to their exceptional thermal and chemical qualities, they
are unlike any other filler material for composite applications. We also
extended the lexicon to include composites that combine boron nitride

and graphene. The high FOMq  measures also indicated an increase in
these  hybrids’  overall  thermal  performance.  The  comparatively  large
filler loadings (i.e., 20–30 %) made their FOM’q results less encouraging.
Hybrid  nanofiller  composites  are  another  promising  nanofiller
wherein two or more nanofiller hybrid combinations permeate the PCM
matrix.  As  a  result  of  their  synergistic  impact,  binary  nanofillers
generally  outperform  either  of  their  components.  Hybrids  of  BN  and
GNP, BN and GO, GNP and CNT, GNP and CNF, and GNP and TRG have
been  found  to  have  a  synergistic  impact  by  several  studies.  It  was
observed that the overall thermal conductivity of a composite sample
increased when a combination of carbon nanofibers (CNF) and carbon
nanotubes (CNT) was utilized to partially substitute the primary filler
material (graphene nanoplatelets, GNP in this instance), in comparison
to  the  reference  composite  sample  consisting  solely  of  GNP.  We
measured an increase of 158 % and 174 % in thermal conductivities,
respectively; hybrid fillers were responsible for an impressive 10–22 %
of this improvement.  Enhanced percolation of the filler inside a PCM
matrix may cause this synergistic enhancement. Substituting a filler such
as a CNT or CNF for the planar GNP allowed for the percolation of the
whole PCM matrix because of the filler’s linked nature. Therefore, we
propose that the physical shape of the hybrid fillers be considered in any
future guidance for selecting hybrid nanofillers so that the full benefits
of the synergistic effect may be realized. Boron nitride composites with a
hybrid  combination  using  only  1.5  %  GNP  showed  a  five-fold
improvement in thermal conductivity, which was remarkable. Howev-
er, it should be emphasized that the 20 % boron nitride loading level was
also  noteworthy.  However,  this  trial’s  synergistic  impact  was  still
noticeable, even with the extensive loading. For a polymer-based com-
posite, the total FOMq was similar in the region of 8000–8700, which is
rather impressive. While BN hybrids compete with carbon-based com-
posites, their commercial viability is diminished because the significant
filler  loadings  severely  impair  their  FOM’q  metric.  To  the  author’s
knowledge, no research has been reported on a hybrid combination of
BN  with  nanofillers  boasting  huge  aspect  ratios,  which  might  yield
spectacular  outcomes  comparable  to  those  we  described  in  our  prior
investigations.

9.1. Effects of nanoparticles on thermophysical properties of nanoparticle
enhanced phase change material

9.1.1. Thermal conductivity

A comparative examination of the utilization of NePCM in TES and
its influence on the thermal conductivity of PCM is presented in Fig. 20.
The obtained findings are optimized outcomes that are utilized in the
TES.  Researchers  have  consistently  sought  to  enhance  the  thermal
conductivity of NePCMs for TES. Nevertheless, the thermal conductivity
of  NePCMs  does  not  possess  a  universally  established  constant  value.
Moreover,  it  has  been  shown  that  the  thermal  conductivity  increases
with the loading of nanoparticles (NPs), though the increment rate is not
constant.  When  comparing  different  materials,  it  was  shown  that  3D
carbon porous materials, such as EG, had more significant potential for
enhancing  heat  conductivity.  Generally,  a  composite  consisting  of
paraffin as a base PCM and EG as a nanoparticle had the highest thermal
conductivity value of 10.37 W/(m⋅K) [225]. The EG nanomaterial ex-
hibits  a  layered  structure  composed  of  carbon  atoms  arranged  in  a
hexagonal  fashion.  This  unique  configuration  allows  for  the  efficient
conduction of heat energy. This layered structure of EG enables heat to
travel along its basal plane predominantly.

capitalizing  on  the  strong  covalent  bonds  between  carbon  atoms
within each layer. Furthermore, the expansion process generates inter-
layer spaces that form a percolation network within the PCM matrix.
Even  at  low  concentrations,  this  network  establishes  interconnected
pathways  for  heat  transfer.  Moreover,  the  expanded  graphite  nano-
platelets possess a high aspect ratio and surface roughness, maximizing
the contact area with the PCM. This increased contact area facilitates the
transfer of thermal energy. As in recent research, unique 3D structured

tetrapods  are  used  with  PCM  matrix;  the  high  aspect  ratio  and  the
complex branching structure (fin shape) of ZnO tetrapods increase the
contact  area  with  the  PCM  matrix.  In  this  context,  the  augmented
interface of tetrapods enables the effective transfer of heat within PCM
matrix,  thereby  improving  thermal  conductivity.  Additionally,  the
branching  structure  of  the  ZnO  tetrapods  forms  a  network  of

interconnected pathways within the PCM matrix, establishing efficient
routes  for  heat  conduction  throughout  the  composite  material.  More-
over, it is crucial to prioritize incorporating supporting materials with
enhanced thermal conductivity in developing hybrid binary or ternary
NePCMs since form stability is essential in TES.

Z. Said et al.

9.1.2. Latent heat

Regarding TES, it is recommended to restrict the drop in latent heat
within the range of 10 %–20 %. Nevertheless, the NePCM depicted in
Fig. 21 exhibited a reduction in latent heat, reaching as high as 62.86 %.
The justification behind including additives is to boost thermal conduc-
tivity and improve form stability and flexibility. The variation in latent
heat  enthalpies  among  different  NePCMs  can  be  related  to  the  mass
decrease of the PCM. This reduction is primarily due to the high mass
fraction  of  nanoparticles,  which  do  not  contribute  to  the  latent  heat
during the melting process. Based on existing research works, it is evident
that the energy density should ideally range between 140 and 180 J/g to
achieve optimal efficiency in TES. The NePCM samples of N-eicosane/EG
Ref.  [158]  and  PEG/diatomite  [231]  exhibited  the  lowest  latent  heat
values of 83.19 J/g and 110.07 J/g, respectively. In both instances, the
latent heat is less than the base PCM, negatively influencing TES. The
primary factor contributing to the increased reduction in latent heat is
the incorporation of 60.62 % in the N-eicosane/EG Ref. [158] NePCM, as
well as the inclusion of 62.86 % in Erythritol/graphene [230] NePCM.
However, in the literature analysis on NePCM for TES, it was observed
that most examples had a value of more than 80 J/g. According to the
data  presented  in  Fig.  21,  there  is  a  direct  relationship  between  the
percentage decrease in latent heat and the combined weight percentages
of nanoparticles (NPs) and supporting materials.

Subsequently, there are few other research work like, PEG-1000 with
0.3 wt% of 3D biochar [13] (latent heat of PEG-1000 increased from
135 J/g to 146.9 J/g), RT50 with 0.3 wt% of Gr nanomaterial [334]
(latent heat of RT50 increased from 136 J/g to 144.3 J/g), RT54 with
0.8 wt% of

Gr nanomaterial with 0.8 % of Gr:Ag hybrid nanomaterial [335] (the
latent  heat  of  RT54  increased  from  182  to  202  J/g)  demonstrates  an
increase in energy storage enthalpy of nanocomposite PCMs. Molecular
interaction between molecules of PCM binds them together in the solid
state; on supply of heat energy, the molecules break themselves, over-
coming the intermolecular force of attraction and undergoing a phase
transition. The energy storage enthalpy and the intensity of the inter-
molecular  force  of  attraction  are  directly  proportional.  With  nano-
material at the very least fraction, the intermolecular force of attraction

increases, with respect to 3D biochar nanomaterial, the presence of C–H
bond  in  the  PEG  + biochar  nanocomposite  and  a  higher  number  of
domain electrons on the surface of nanoparticle affects the intermolec-
ular bonding between the interface of PEG and CS nanoparticle causing
an increase in enthalpy. Regarding Gr nanomaterials, the 2D lamellar
sheets provide maximum filling of the base material, enabling efficient
energy storage and increasing energy density. Gr nanomaterial also acts
as  a  conducting  binder,  enhancing  the  intermolecular  interaction  be-
tween GNP and PCM matrix.

9.1.3. Melting point

The  melting  point  of  PCM  and  the  resulting  nanocomposite  may
exhibit a slight deviation due to differences in thermal conductivity and
interactions between the support material and PCM. Introducing nano-
materials into the PCM matrix can alter the intermolecular forces and
cause a minor variation in the melting point. It has been observed that
nanomaterials  with  higher  thermal  conductivity  tend  to  decrease  the
melting point slightly, while those with lower thermal conductivity may
have the opposite effect. The lack of considerable modification in the
melting temperature of PCM due to the presence of carbon and metal-
based  nanoparticles  in  trace  amounts  can  be  subsequently  deduced
from the data shown in Fig. 22. However, including nanoparticles leads
to a marginal elevation in the melting point of the pure PCM because of
an  enhancement  in  thermal  conductivity.  Using  nanoparticles  with
higher surface area-to-volume ratios can effectively boost thermal con-
ductivity.  As  a  result,  this  can  potentially  reduce  the  phase  transition
temperature  due  to  the  enhancement  of  heat  transfer.  However,  it  is
crucial  to  take  into  account  the  specific  characteristics  of  the  nano-
particles, such as their composition and structure, as these attributes also
contribute  significantly  to  this  phenomenon.  The  major  factors  influ-
encing melting point are (a) intermolecular forces (b) molecular bonding
and (c) shape and size of the molecule. Although a consistent pattern

in the variation of the melting temperature of NePCM was not found,
it can be inferred that the range of variation in melting temperature falls
within ±20 %. Moreover, the choice of melting temperature is contin-
gent upon the surrounding temperature and the specific use case. In line
with  the  TES  scenario,  the  melting  temperature  of  the  NePCM  is

In this section, a comprehensive critical analysis of the performance
of PCMs and their NePCMs has been conducted, drawing on a wealth of
research findings. The analysis spans several key performance metrics,
including  thermal  conductivity,  latent  heat,  melting  point,  and  the
impact of nanoparticles on these properties. Key takeaways include:

1.  Thermal conductivity enhancements:

• NePCMs  have  shown  significant  improvements  in  thermal  con-
ductivity compared to base PCMs, which is essential for effective
TES systems.

• Notably, 3D carbon porous materials like expanded graphite (EG)
have demonstrated potential in enhancing heat conductivity, with
composite PCMs containing EG showing the highest thermal con-
ductivity values.

2.  Latent heat considerations:

• The addition of nanoparticles typically reduces the latent heat of
PCMs, impacting the energy density crucial for TES systems.
• Optimal  efficiency  in  TES  requires  an  energy  density  range  of
80–120 J/g. Notably, some NePCMs have shown latent heat values
below this optimal range, indicating a need for careful consider-
ation of nanoparticle incorporation.

3.  Melting point variability:

• The introduction of nanoparticles has only a marginal effect on the
melting  point  of  pure  PCMs,  primarily  due  to  the  high  melting
temperatures of these nanoparticles.

• However,  including  supporting  materials  for  form  stability  can
influence the melting temperature, with variations typically within
a range of ±20 %.
4.  Impact of nanoparticles:

• Carbon  and  metal-based  nanoparticles  have  been  found  to
marginally  elevate  the  melting  point  of  PCMs  due  to  enhanced
thermal conductivity.

• The specific influence of nanoparticle type, loading, and support-
ing materials on the thermophysical properties of PCMs has been
highlighted.

5.  Recommendations and future directions:

• To  achieve  effective  thermal  management  systems,  it  is  recom-
mended that the thermal conductivity of PCMs should be in the
range of 0.1–10.5 W/(m⋅K) and the latent heat within 100–255 J/
g.

• The  selection  of  melting  temperature  should  be  tailored  to  the
surrounding  environment  and  specific  application  needs,  with  a
recommended range for TES scenarios between 25
C.

In conclusion, the performance of PCMs and NePCMs is a complex
interplay  of  various  factors,  including  the  type  of  PCM,  nanoparticle
incorporation,  and  supporting  materials.  While  advancements  have
been made in enhancing thermal properties, there remains a need for
further  research  to  optimize  these  materials  for  specific  applications,
ensuring  the  balance  between  thermal  conductivity,  latent  heat,  and
melting  point  is  maintained.  This  critical  analysis  paves  the  way  for
future  innovations  and  improvements  in  the  field  of  thermal  energy
storage and management.

10. Challenges and difficulties in developing NePCM

these  barriers  and  enhance  the  overall  effectiveness  of  NePCMs.  The
preparation of NePCMs for large scale applications are of considerable
issue. At present NePCMs are in transition from laboratory to small sized
thermal  regulation  units  where  the  requirement  of  NePCM  is  within
8–10 kg.

Nonetheless, in specific to the thermal regulation of buildings, the
quantity of NePCMs opted are in tonnes. Techniques to disperse nano-
particles, within the PCM matrix are immature, and NePCM prepared
requires a controlled environment focusing on temperature and ambient
conditions. Likewise, no hybridization techniques or methods have yet
been reported on the dispersion of nanomaterials with PCM for large-
scale  applications.  The  lack  of  theoretical  modeling  on  nano  struc-
tured PCM to yield empirical relations to predict the thermal properties
of NePCM is very limited. As well all the existing research is specifically
intended  only  for  lab-scale  research;  however,  the  enhancement  in
thermophysical properties of NePCM on being prepared on large scale is
expected to vary considerably.

Further, controlling the orientation and distribution of nanoparticles
is  crucial  for  changing  the  thermal  conductivity  of  NePCM.  More  in-
depth  study  on  nanoparticle  distribution  is  necessary  to  achieve
optimal  thermal  performance.  While  integrating  NePCM  into  thermal
energy application systems offers the advantage of augmented thermal
performance  and  increased  heat  transfer  rate,  the  energy  storage  po-
tential  of  NePCM  varies  with  the  quantity  of  nanoparticles.  NePCM
integration  faces  the  challenge  of  material  compatibility  in  solar  PV
systems, which can affect the panel structure or electrical performance.
Key concerns include optimizing thermal conductivity while maintain-
ing stability and selecting cost-effective, durable materials. For BTMS,
implementing  NePCMs  without  ensuring  material  compatibility  can
adversely affect long-term performance and durability. Addressing this
involves  identifying  suitable  NePCM  that  can  optimize  heat  transfer,
managing  scalability  and  cost-effectiveness,  developing  accurate  pre-
dictive  models,  and  meeting  regulatory  standards  and  safety
requirements.

10.2. Temperature dependence

Vital challenge and limitation of PCM and NePCM is that they are
temperature dependent. The charging and discharging process of PCMs
(thermal  battery)  cannot  be  defined  as  an  electrical  battery  using  a
switch. Electrical batteries can be controlled via a switch as per the users
need  to  use  and  pause,  whereas  PCMs  are  completely  temperature-
dependent.  When  the  ambient  temperature  drops  below  the  phase
transition temperature of PCMs, discharging occurs, whereas charging
occurs only when the ambient temperature rises above the phase tran-
sition  temperature  of  PCMs  as  per  the  designated  application.  When
integrating NePCMs and PCMs with any thermal regulation system, the
PCM must freeze back completely to offer efficient thermal regulation
facilities for the subsequent cycle. In case of failure to freeze back owing
to external aids and low ambient temperature, the system will fail to
offer thermal regulation, which is of serious concern. In regard to the
application, NePCM integrated buildings are operated passively for the
location that offers a change in ambient temperature for every day by
15
C. An active method is adopted to ensure PCM facilitates thermal
comfort operation in locations where the change in ambient tempera-
ture is below 15

C for a complete day.

10.3. Safety

Despite  the  promising  potential  of  NePCMs,  several  technological
barriers  hinder  their  widespread  adoption.  Effective  dispersion  and
stabilization of nanoparticles within the PCM matrix is of great concern.
Achieving  uniform  nanoparticle  distribution  is  crucial  to  ensure
consistent thermal performance and prevent issues such as phase sepa-
ration  or  aggregation.  Researchers  are  actively  exploring  innovative
encapsulation  techniques  and  nanomaterial  engineering  to  overcome

Though  the  developed  NePCMs  are  chemically  stable,  PCMs
(organic)  are  flammable  in  nature;  subsequently,  nanoparticles  are
toxic. Organic PCMs are flammable despite numerous benefits like non-
corrosive,  stable  nature,  congruent  thermal  cycling,  and  stability  to-
wards phase  separation. Most  thermal regulation  units like electronic
gadgets, battery thermal management, and buildings are susceptible to
igniting;  henceforth,  integrating  organic  PCMs  with  this  system  is  a

higher risk. This leads to the need for a flame inhibitor to explore the
benefits  of  organic  PCMs,  on  the  other  hand,  salt  hydrate  PCMs  are
preferred [12]. The usage of nanoparticles needs utmost care and safe
handling by the worker and research in contact with nanomaterials, as
they  are  cancer-causing  agents.  This  hinders  the  need  for  skilled
chemists  and  researchers  to  synthesize  nanoparticles  and  develop
NePCMs.

10.7. Commercial market penetration

As PCM and NePCM are new classes of energy storage materials, it is
tedious to capture commercial markets intended to attract the reliability
and  thrust  of  customers  at  the  early  stage.  PCMs  being  a  chemical
element, its usage for daily operation is of utmost concern as its difficult
to convince government approval as well as to attract customers.

10.4. Economic challenges

11. Conclusions and future recommendations

The economic feasibility of NePCM implementation can be a limi-
tation in certain applications. While NePCMs offer long-term cost sav-
ings  through  improved  energy  efficiency,  but  their  initial  production
and integration costs might be higher than traditional materials. This
can be a significant barrier to adoption, especially in cost-sensitive in-
dustries.  Addressing  the  economic  challenges  requires  optimizing
manufacturing  processes,  scaling  up  production,  and  demonstrating
clear cost benefits over the lifecycle of NePCM-based systems. In addi-
tion, the choice of nanoparticles is pivotal from a cost perspective. The
increment  in  cost  due  to  the  use  of  certain  nanoparticles  must  be
weighed against the benefits, as it directly affects the large-scale pro-
duction feasibility of NePCM. Erection of instruments and machinery for
preparation of NePCM is another extra cost that adds on to the overall
operation. Nevertheless, this is a one-time investment cost with proper
maintenance and regular instrument service.

10.5. Environmental concerns

While NePCMs hold promise in enhancing energy efficiency, envi-
ronmental concerns are associated with their production and applica-
tion. The synthesis of nanoparticles and the energy-intensive processes
involved in NePCM manufacturing can contribute to resource depletion
and  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  Additionally,  the  potential  release  of
nanoparticles  into  the  environment  during  the  life  cycle  of  NePCMs
warrants  careful  consideration.  Conducting  comprehensive  life  cycle
assessments  to  understand  the  environmental  impacts  and  identify
strategies  to  mitigate  any  potential  adverse  effects  is  essential.  More-
over, addressing the challenges related to the long-term stability, envi-
ronmental impact, and health concerns of NePCMs is imperative. This
includes  ensuring  consistent  nanoparticle  dispersion  while  managing
the costs and potential long-term effects on the environment and human
health.

10.6. Regulatory and policy implications

The deployment of NePCMs in various applications may encounter
regulatory  and  policy  challenges.  As  a  relatively  novel  technology,
NePCM  integration  might  require  compliance  with  existing  standards
and  regulations  governing  materials,  energy  storage,  and  waste  man-
agement. Additionally, policies that promote sustainable materials and
energy-efficient technologies can influence the adoption of NePCMs in
different  industries.  Collaborative  efforts  between  policymakers,  re-
searchers,  and  industries  are  necessary  to  establish  supportive  frame-
works  that  foster  the  sustainable  integration  of  NePCMs.  The
Department  of  Environment,  Ministry  of  Natural  Resources,  Environ-
ment and Climate Change has established technical guidelines [337] for
properly handling garbage polluted with persistent organic pollutants
(POPs) per their environmental regulations. The guidelines specify that
the  material  should  undergo  pre-treatment  using  methods  such  as
dewatering, size reduction, mechanical separation, thermal desorption,
adsorption  and  absorption,  pH  adjustment,  and  oil-water  separation.
After pre-treatment, the material can be disposed of using techniques
like hazardous-waste incineration, plasma arc, or waste-to-gas conver-
sion. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate a pre-treatment and degrading
method that facilitates the convenient disposal of the solid waste created
from the used phase change material.

11.1. Conclusions

This extensive review explores into the intricate world of nano ad-
ditives  in  PCM,  highlighting  how  dimensionality  critically  influences
thermal  conductivity.  Integrating  nano  additives  significantly  trans-
forms  PCM  performance,  with  pore  size,  morphology,  structure,  and
loading emerging as key factors. The orientation of nano additives plays
a decisive role in PCM efficiency. Incorporating 3D nanostructures with
smaller pore sizes is identified as a pivotal development for enhancing
PCM performance. Surface treatment of 1D and 2D nano additives en-
hances  nanoparticle  dispersion  but  has  a  complex  impact  on  thermal
conductivity. Single 3D nano additives are shown to be more efficient
than hybrid counterparts, offering improved performance due to their
intrinsic  structural  advantages.  Forming  a  cohesive  3D  conductive
network using hybrid nano additives remains a challenge, yet holds the
promise of higher thermal conductivity with lower additive loads. Pre-
vailing the adoption of PCM for thermal energy storage can help bridge
the mismatch between energy demand and supply. NePCM effectively
overcomes  the  issues  of  low  thermal  conductivity,  flammable  nature,
and phase instability, thereby ensuring the reliability of PCM for a wide
range  of  thermal  regulation  applications.  The  implications  of  nano-
materials have attracted numerous researchers and scientists who want
to explore the potential of NePCM. This review underscores the trans-
formative potential of NePCM in energy storage and thermal manage-
ment, emphasizing the need for ongoing research and development to
overcome current challenges and enhance practical applicability. In this
review  work,  the  authors  provide  a  comprehensive  summary  on  ad-
vances  in  NePCM  in  terms  of  synthesis;  fundamental  interaction  be-
tween nanomaterials and PCM causing enhancement in thermophysical
properties;  and  cutting-edge  applications  focusing  on  environmental
and economic factors.

• Conventional PCM and nanomaterial dispersed PCMs are intended
for thermal energy storage and for thermal regulation applications.
As  far  as  conventional  PCMs  are  concerned,  they  exhibit  poor
charging  and  discharging  rates  owing  to  the  low  thermal  conduc-
tance, which causes delay activation of PCM towards thermal regu-
lation  systems.  Subsequently,  PCM  offers  very
low  optical
absorbance  and makes it not advisable for solar  energy storage in
spite of energy storage potential. With few PCM, nucleation doesn’t
occur  at  their  freezing  temperature  and  causes  a  degree  of  super-
cooling; this literally disturbs the heat storage process as the PCM
remains  in  liquid  state  during  melting  (causing  energy  to  store).
Some  PCM  are  also  prone  to  phase  separation  during  repeated
thermal  cycling  operations.  Whereas  nanomaterial  dispersed  PCM
establishes proper thermal networks and improves the charging and
discharging rate, on average, the increase in charging rate is about
90–110  %  for  nanocomposite  PCM,  whereas  for  form  and  shape
stabilized PCM the charging rate is boosted by almost 700–900 %. An
added advantage is in regard to optical absorbance, the dark nature,
and the ability to absorb light rays owing to the multiple reflections
within the unique structure of nanomaterials. NePCM also facilitates
the initiation of crystallization, causing a nucleation effect that re-
duces supercooling and phase separation issues.

• NePCMs are  synthesized via  single, two,  three  and  four step  tech-
niques. A smaller number of steps are involved in the preparation of

NePCM; however, different combinations of nanomaterial and PCM
require  different  preparation  methods.  Based  on  the  existing
research  and  review,  encapsulation  and  foam  stable  processes  are
tedious  as  they  are  focused  on  controlling  the  leakage  issue  and
phase  instability.  However,  nano  enhanced  foam  stable  PCM  are
developed widely for organic PCM; there is the least number of nano
enhanced foam stable PCM using inorganic salt hydrates as the hy-
drate molecules are expected to vaporize during the preparation.
• Nanotechnology has been a forefront reason for the development of
nanomaterials,  which  predominantly  enhance  the  thermophysical
properties of PCM. Desirable features are achieved owing to the nano
architectonics  of  nanomaterial  in  terms  of  unique  size,  shape  and
structure.  Three  class  of  nanomaterials  are  primarily  taken  into
consideration  for  dispersion  with  PCM  matrix:  a)  metal  additives,
which come in powder and metal foam forms; b) carbon additives,
which  are  categorized  as  0D,  1D,  2D,  and  3D  depending  on  their
dimensions  and  use  fullerene,  CNT/CNF,  graphene,  and  graphite
nano additives; and c) polymer additives. 1D nanomaterials facilitate
the proper thermal network, whereas they are prone to agglomera-
tion;  2D  nanomaterials  offer  a  better  surface  area  for  improving
thermal  conductivity  and  energy  storage  ability,  whereas  the  low
density of these material cause floating in case of excess material; 3D
nanomaterials  support  well  distributed  thermal  channels  in  multi
direction, as well these materials are highly preferred for foam stable
PCM.

• Contact  mechanism  of  nanomaterial  and  PCM  matrix  in  terms  of
Vander-Waal’s  interaction,  intermolecular  force  of  attraction,
hydrogen bonding within PCM molecules, surface functionalization,
role  of capillary and  surface tension,  nucleation effect and  optical
absorbance  of  the  developed  NePCM  are  discussed  and  inferred
elaboratively.

• Modification  of  the  melting  temperature  is  contingent  upon  the
interplay  of  intermolecular  forces,  molecular  bonding,  and  the
structural characteristics of nanoparticles with the PCM matrix. The
variation  in  phase  transition  temperature  of  nanocomposite  PCM
with  different  dimensional  nanomaterial  is  about  (cid:0) 8  %–20  %;
however, this varies from stable PCMs. Whereas the thermal network
influences thermal conductivity of NePCM, the velocity of phonon
group,  and  the  mean  free  path  between  phonons.  Most  of  the
research  demonstrates  an  increase  in  thermal  conductivity  by
80–120 % (ranges between 0.4 and 0.8 W/(m⋅K)) with the dispersion
of nanomaterial at weight fraction below 1.5 %, whereas with form
stable PCMs the concentration of nanomaterials increases and thus
the increase in thermal conductivity is predominant [ranges between
2  and  8  W/(m⋅K)].  An  increase  in  thermal  conductivity  of  nano-
composite PCM increases the rate of charging and enables fast dis-
charging, which is not significant for thermal regulation. Also, a high
concentration  of  nanomaterials  drops  energy  storage  potential.
Subsequently,  energy  storage  ability  is  influenced  by  the  intermo-
lecular  force  of  attraction  between  the  nanomaterials  and  PCM,
enabling stronger bonds, and demanding higher heat input for phase
transition. Nanoparticles reduce the latent heat of PCMs, lowering
energy density; however, some NePCMs have maintained latent heat
values within the ideal range for TES applications (80–120 J/g), but
below this range in some situations. To balance thermal storage ca-
pacity, nanoparticle selection and integration are crucial.

• Low thermal conductivity is a predominant barrier to PCM’s rapid
charging and discharging. Existing research resolves the aforemen-
tioned  problem  via  a)  dispersing  of  thermally  conductive  fillers
(nanomaterials)  and  b)  encapsulating  within  shells.  Owing  to
exceptional  thermal  features and  low  density,  carbon  based  nano-
materials are superior over metal and ceramic based thermal fillers.
Expanded graphite, graphene aerogel/foams improve thermal con-
ductivity more than other carbon nanomaterials.

• Due  to  organic  PCM’s  thermal  stability  and  reliability  during
repeated operation, nanoparticle-dispersed PCMs are actively tested

using  battery  thermal  management,  solar  thermal  systems,  and
photovoltaic systems. All the aforementioned applications required a
low  quantity  of  NePCM  compared  to  building  thermal  regulation
applications.  As  far  as  building  heating  and  cooling  is  concerned,
PCM  are  preferred  over  NePCM  in  spite  of  their  low  thermal
conductance, as the synthesis of NePCM is tedious for large quanti-
ties.  Establishing  industries  with  reliable  and  easy  techniques  to
develop NePCM will accelerate its commercial application.

• Melting temperature, sensible/latent heat, and thermal conductivity
are  important  considerations  when  selecting  PCMs  for  thermal
storage.  Costs  should  also  be  taken  into  account,  although  not  as
much because of market instability. Economic, safety, and environ-
mental  considerations  should  be  considered  for  a  more  environ-
mentally  friendly  thermal  storage  system.  Multi-criteria  decision-
making  techniques,  such  as  optimization  tools,  are  also  helpful  in
PCM selection and development.

• Though  numerous  research  works  are  focused  on  enhancing  the
thermal  conductivity  of  PCM  using  nanomaterials;  awareness  and
policies on disposal of the developed NePCMs after long term usage
remain unanswered. Technological advancement to separate nano-
material  from  PCM  after  long  term  usage  before  disposal  to  the
environment would have an emerging need.

• AI has enormous potential for improving the use of materials with
increased phase transitions at the nanoscale. NePCM systems can be
optimized for various applications, such as TES, building insulation,
electronics  cooling,  and  more,  by  utilizing  AI  techniques,  such  as
material  design  and  optimization,  predictive  modelling,  process
optimization,  sensing  and  monitoring,  and  control  optimization.
Thermal  management  and  energy  storage  solutions  benefit  from
increased efficiency, dependability, and sustainability thanks to the
integration of AI with NePCM.

11.2. Future directions

The  future  of  NePCM  is  rich  with  opportunities  and  challenges.
Advancing  research  in  hybrid  NePCM  systems  is  essential,  promising
enhanced  efficiency  and  environmental  sustainability.  Developing
environmentally  friendly  nanoparticle  synthesis  methods  becomes  a
commitment to ecological responsibility. Scaling up NePCM for large-
scale  applications  presents  a  crucial  challenge,  integrating  efficiency
with  scalability.  Innovations  in  PCM  enhancement  should  explore  a
combination of 0D, 1D, 2D, and 3D materials, each contributing unique
properties.  Utilizing  surfactants  for  precise  nanoparticle  placement
could significantly improve heat transfer rates. Addressing the viscous
effects of NePCM that reduce thermal performance opens the door to
exploring alternative solvents for improved thermal conductivity. The
field of NePCM stands at a pivotal juncture, necessitating a harmonious
balance  between  performance  enhancement,  cost-effectiveness,  scal-
ability,  and  environmental  considerations.  The  path  ahead  is  chal-
lenging, but these challenges drive the relentless pursuit of innovation in
this field.

• At present, the discharge of stored thermal energy from NePCM is
temperature dependent, i.e., if the ambient temperature drops below
the temperature of NePCM in a liquid state, energy discharge starts.
This  temperature-driven  discharge  phenomenon  is  a  major  hin-
drance for practical application as electrical batteries are controlled
via  an  external  switch.  Control  over  the  discharging  of  PCM  will
eventually enhance the real time usage. Henceforth, artificial intel-
ligence is currently needed to control the charging and discharging
phenomena.

• There  is  an  absence  of  mathematical  modeling  on  nano  material
enhanced PCM resulting in concrete relationships that can only be
used in conjunction with specific nano material and organic PCM to
forecast  the  thermophysical  properties  of  NePCM.  Theoretical  ex-
planations for the improvement and degradation of characteristics,

including  thermal  conductivity,  latent  heat,  phase  instability  and
viscosity  upon  doping  of  nano  inclusions,  are  lacking  in  the
literature.

• Present investigations primarily concentrate on characterizing and
testing  the  thermal  properties  of  nano  additives  integrated  with
organic  PCM  in  a  lab  setting.  However,  to  enhance  the  thermal
regulation application of PCM towards a sustainable future, NePCM
based  commercial  products  need  to  be  made  viable  globally.
Furthermore,  a  plethora  of  application-focused,  real-time  experi-
mental research projects are planned  to advance the commerciali-
zation of organic NePCM.

• The  existing  research  works  focus  mostly  on  characterizing  and
testing the thermal characteristics of nano additives combined with
organic PCM in a laboratory setting. However, in order to improve
the thermal regulation application of PCM and ensure a sustainable
future, NePCM-based  commercial  products must  be made globally
feasible. However, there is a need for sophisticated technology that
can produce NePCM with a uniform dispersion of nanomaterials in
the  PCM  matrix  on  a  mass  scale.  As  a  result,  there  is  a  need  for
technologically  enhanced  materials  capable  of  dispersing  nano-
particles  with  PCM  while  avoiding  phase  separation  and  environ-
mental damage. Furthermore, significant experimental research are
needed to support and validate the positive outcomes and theoretical
concepts mentioned here. These studies are crucial in bridging the
gap between theoretical expectations and real-world applications, as
they provide insights into the practical problems and performance
metrics of NePCM systems under varied situations. By concentrating
on experimental research, the NePCM community can accelerate the
development  of  more  efficient,  dependable,  and  environmentally
responsible thermal management technologies.

• Need  for  advanced  technology,  which  can  develop  NePCM  with
uniform  dispersion  of  nanomaterial  with  PCM  matrix,  on  being
developed  in  tonnes  of  mass.  Subsequently,  there  is  a  need  to
advance  technologically,  exhibiting  the  potential  to  disperse  nano
materials  with  PCM  without  phase  separation  and  harming  the
environment.

• Integrating AI with NePCM systems offers a transformative prospect
alongside material and structural developments. The potential of AI
to improve the efficiency and practicality of NePCM systems is sig-
nificant. We can greatly enhance thermal management and energy
storage systems by using AI methodologies in material design and
optimization, predictive modeling, process optimization, and sensing
and  monitoring.  These  developments  are  especially  vital  in  appli-
cations such as TES, building insulation, and electronics cooling. The
capability  of  AI  to  analyze  real-time  data  and  dynamically  adjust
operating  parameters  can  result  in  improved  efficiency  and  reli-
ability  of  NePCM-based  devices.  The  future  of  NePCM  technology
hinges not only on material advancements but also on the intelligent
incorporation of AI. This integration can guarantee enhanced phase
transitions  at the  nanoscale, resulting  in improved  efficiency,  reli-
ability, and sustainability.
