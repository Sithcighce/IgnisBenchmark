1. Introduction

Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) have witnessed significant advancements in recent years, emerging as potential
alternatives to low-temperature fuel cells for mobile applications owing to their wide fuel flexibility and high
efficiency. This paper offers a comprehensive assessment of the progress achieved thus far and the challenges
faced in transitioning from stationary to mobility sectors. Three pivotal aspects are highlighted across different
levels: enhancing fuel tolerance and flexibility at the anode level, achieving rapid start-up at the cell level, and
realizing compact integration at the stack level. This review can lay a theoretical foundation for the development
of  SOFC  systems  tailored  to  unique  requirements,  such  as  high  power  density  and  rapid  start-up,  crucial  for
mobile applications. This review will facilitate commercial breakthroughs and advances in the mobility of SOFCs,
which holds substantial strategic importance.

With  the  growing  urgency  to  address  global  warming  and  air
pollution concerns, extensive research efforts have been devoted to the
development of clean energy technologies. Fuel cells are emerging as
promising technologies for future mobile power supply, serving as al-
ternatives to conventional combustion engines, primarily owing to their
high conversion efficiencies and reduced emissions. Among the various
fuel cell types, proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) stand as
pioneers and dominators in this field, especially in the realm of long-
distance transportation.

Historically,  solid  oxide  fuel  cells  (SOFCs),  which  operate  at  rela-
tively  high  temperatures  ranging  from 600  to  1000
C,  were  deemed
unsuitable for mobile applications. The solid oxide ceramic electrolyte
presented challenges in terms of rapid start-up and shutdown. However,
in  the  context  of  the  mobility  sector,  the  high  operating  temperature
offers  distinct  advantages  over  low-temperature  PEMFCs,  particularly
concerning  fuel  flexibility  and  efficiency.  SOFCs  exhibit  versatility  in
handling a variety of fuels, including liquefied natural gas (LNG), liq-
uefied  petroleum  gas  (LPG),  methanol,  and  ethanol.  Moreover,  their
tolerance  toward  fuel  impurities  addresses  problems  associated  with

hydrogen  cleaning,  transportation,  and  storage.  The  capability  to
employ liquid fuels holds significant potential for reducing the required
fuel storage volume. For example, when using LPG as a fuel source, the
fuel tank volume can be approximately 1/5 of that needed for a high-
pressure  hydrogen  tank.  This  feature  holds  particular  importance  in
the  mobility  sector,  where  space  constraints  are  severe,  especially  in
long-distance  transportation  applications.  Furthermore,  SOFCs  oper-
ating with hydrocarbon fuels have demonstrated 50 % system efficiency,
surpassing the performance of state-of-the-art PEMFCs, which typically
achieve approximately 40 % efficiency [1].

In recent years, the development of SOFCs has prominently centered
around  exploration  of  alternative  materials  [2]  and  analysis  of  geo-
metric  configurations  [3,4]  and  stacking  methodologies  [5].  This
heightened focus has generated increased interest in the development of
mobile SOFC systems in competition with PEMFCs [6,7]. SOFCs have
been  used  in  portable  power,  small  auxiliary  power  units  (APUs),
portable  electronics,  and  transportation  fields  [8–11].  However,  the
mobile application of SOFC systems has not progressed at the same rate
as their stationary counterparts, which have already been commercially
used in both large-scale 100 kW-class units [12,13] and small-scale 1
kW-class  SOFC-based  cogeneration  systems  [14].  When  developing  a

mobile SOFC system, key considerations include ease of use, robustness,
and power density, while for stationary SOFC systems, total efficiency
takes  precedence  [15].  This  review  primarily  concentrates  on  the
progress  made  to  address  the  specific  requirements  of  the  mobility
sector, aiming to overcome the limitations of and leverage the advan-
tages of SOFCs.

Fuel flexibility. The elevated operating temperature and presence of
Ni-based anodes endow SOFCs with remarkable fuel flexibility, allowing
them to utilize not only carbon-free fuels but also carbon monoxide (CO)
and  low  levels  of  hydrocarbons.  Enhancing  the  fuel  flexibility  and
tolerance of SOFCs to accommodate fuels compatible with existing in-
frastructures  can  expand  their  application  scope  and  promote  system
compactness.  Additionally,  as  previously  discussed,  the  use  of  easily
liquefiable fuels with high energy densities can significantly reduce the
space  needed  for  fuel  storage—a  critical  consideration  for  prolonged
operation.

Rapid  start-up.  In  contrast  to  stationary  applications  that  demand
continuous operation, mobile applications are characterized by frequent
start–stop cycles. Repeated transient operation can result in substantial
temperature gradients and significant thermal stresses within the cells
and stacks, leading to performance degradation and reduced lifespan.
The inherent fragility of ceramics with limited thermal shock resistance
and  the  high  operating  temperatures  of  traditional  SOFCs  necessitate
relatively extended start-up times (e.g., on the scale of hours). Therefore,
when considering mobile applications, it becomes imperative to explore
SOFC materials and structures that are resistant to mechanical strain as
well  as  have  lower  operating  temperatures  and  reduced  temperature
variations.

High power density. In the mobility sector, achieving high volumetric/
gravimetric stack/system power densities is of paramount importance to
minimize space and weight requirements. The power density of a stack is
significantly  influenced  by  the  choice  of  materials  and  its  geometric
configuration.  Typically,  current  commercial  stacks  exhibit  power
(cid:0) 1  [1]. However, as evaluated by
densities ranging from 0.1 to 1 kW L
AVL List GmbH, it is imperative to elevate this value to a range of 1–1.2
(cid:0) 1  to effectively compete with existing technologies, particularly
kW L
for range extenders [16]. Enhancing the volumetric power density of the
stack requires not only the compact integration of the stack itself but
also the implementation of efficient heat management strategies due to
the elevated rate of heat release.

In addition to the distinctive requirements mentioned above, high
electrical  efficiency  and  prolonged  durability  are  fundamental  pre-
requisites  for  both  stationary  and  mobile  SOFC  systems.  Currently,
SOFCs are predominantly associated with stationary technologies, with
mobile applications  are still less  known. Thus, this paper reviews the
progress made in various aspects, ranging from anode materials to cell
units and stacks, to achieve the unique objectives demanded by mobility
applications.

The structure of this review is outlined in Fig. 1. Section 2 delves into

the  effective  utilization  of  diverse  fuels  characterized  by  high  energy
densities. Particular emphasis is placed on examining the reaction ki-
netics of conversion high hydrocarbons within the anode compartment
as  well  as  the  advancements  achieved  at  the  anode  material  level  to
enable  the  efficient  internal  utilization  of  hydrocarbon  fuels  and
nitrogen-containing  compounds.  Section  3  focuses  on  cell-level  de-
velopments of SOFCs operating at low temperatures and/or possessing
exceptional  thermal  shock  resistance  to  facilitate  rapid  start-up.
Comprehensive comparisons of various cell geometries and configura-
tions  are  conducted  in  terms  of  their  thermal  cycling  capabilities.
Finally,  in  Section  4,  stack  integration  concerns,  such  as  current
collection  and thermal  management, are  discussed in  light of  the im-
peratives for stack compactness and achieving high volumetric power
densities.

2. Fuel tolerance and fuel flexibility

Hydrogen  is  the  optimal  fuel  for  SOFCs  from  a  cell  perspective.
However, H2 production entails high costs and poses challenges in terms
of storage and transportation. Consequently, a range of alternative fuel
options have been explored, as summarized in Table 1. Hydrocarbons

have undergone extensive investigation as potential SOFC fuels. Natural
gas, primarily composed of methane (CH4), is commonly stored as LNG
or compressed natural gas (CNG). CH4 has already found widespread use
as a fuel for commercial internal combustion engines (ICEs) in vehicles;
it is also being considered as a fuel source for SOFC systems in trans-
portation applications. Propane and butane exhibit distinct advantages
as fuels for portable power owing to their unique characteristics. Pro-
pane remains in a gaseous state at standard temperature and pressure
but  can  be  easily  liquefied  at  pressures  of  14  atm,  making  it  more
manageable for storage and transportation compared to methane [17,
18]. Conversely, liquid propane and butane exhibit considerably higher
energy densities than methanol and ethanol. Gasoline and diesel, sup-
ported by mature production and distribution infrastructures, continue
to serve as primary fuels for transportation applications [19].

In addition to carbon-based fuels, ammonia (NH3) has emerged as an
alternative hydrogen carrier in portable applications. It can be readily
liquefied at room temperature under modest pressures (~20 bar) and
has  a  narrow  combustion  range  [20].  In  addition,  the  low  cost,  high
energy  density,  and  well-established  transportation  network  position
NH3  as a promising clean or low-carbon fuel with a broad application
scope [21].

In the case of nitrogen-bearing compounds such as ammonia, direct
utilization at the anode is feasible, owing to the high catalytic activity of
nickel (Ni) in facilitating ammonia decomposition. Conversely, for hy-
drocarbons,  a  reforming  process  is  typically  utilized  to  improve  the
performance and durability of fuel cells. The reforming process for hy-
drocarbons involves breaking down C–C and C–H bonds, yielding H2 and
smaller  carbonaceous  molecules.  This  process  can  be  classified  into
several types depending on the type of oxidants used: steam reforming,
partial oxidation, dry reforming, and autothermal reforming [22].

Among  the  various  reforming  processes,  partial  oxidation  (POx)
stands  out  as  the  most  favorable  choice  for  portable  systems.  This
preference is attributed to its rapid start-up and responsive character-
istics, as well as its elimination of the need for external sources of steam
and  heat  [23].  In  addition,  autothermal  reforming  (ATR)  has  been
considered as an option for fuel reforming in SOFC-APU systems.

Fig. 2 illustrates the typical utilization mode of hydrocarbon fuels in
mobile SOFC systems. Both external reforming and partial pre-reforming
processes require an external reformer to convert hydrocarbons to more
readily useable fuels for SOFCs, such as H2, CO, and small C–C chain

hydrocarbons. While external reformers have been well-established for
large-scale stationary systems, the trend for small-scale portable appli-
cations is to downsize the reformer to achieve compactness, rapid start-
up, and transient response [24,25]. One effective approach is to increase
the surface-to-volume ratio of reformers, enabling them to handle high
volumes of fluid flow within a small reactor [26,27]. With the use of
monolithic honeycombs and foams as catalyst carriers and even micro-
reactors with submillimeter-scale dimensions, surface-to-volume ratios
ranging from 10,000 to 50,000 m

(cid:0) 1 can be achieved [28].

Despite  the  advantages  of  external  reformers  in  addressing  issues
such  as  carbon  deposition  and  enhancing  SOFC  efficiency,  their
increased  system  complexity  makes  them  less  suitable  for  mobile  ap-
plications. Thus, there is a greater preference for the internal utilization
of  fuels  with  high  energy densities.  This  can be  achieved through  in-
ternal reforming or direct utilization (Fig. 2 (c)). In this scenario, the
anode must perform three crucial functions: catalyze the fuel reforming
process, catalyze the electrochemical oxidation reactions of H2 and CO,
and provide an electron pathway [22]. Methanol and ethanol, owing to
the presence of O, exhibit easy direct utilization characteristics. Conse-
quently, there have been a few studies demonstrating the direct utili-
zation of alcohols for portable applications [29–34].

The utilization of methane in SOFCs can be found in previous reviews
[35,36].  In  this  comprehensive  review,  particular  emphasis  has  been
placed on hydrocarbons beyond CH4, as they are more preferable and
practical  for  mobile  applications.  However,  the  internal  utilization  of
these higher hydrocarbons at the anode can lead to significant carbon
deposition issues. A profound and comprehensive understanding of the
kinetics  of  reactions  on  traditional  Ni-based  anodes  forms  a  crucial
foundation for the development of novel anode materials, ensuring the
efficient utilization of higher hydrocarbons. Section 2.1 delves into the
investigation of reaction kinetics of the conversion of hydrocarbons on
Ni-based anodes, while Section 2.2 explores strategies for enhancing fuel
tolerance through anode development.

2.1. Reaction kinetics of hydrocarbon conversion on Ni-based anodes

2.1.1. Mechanisms of chemical and electrochemical reactions

When  hydrocarbons  enter  the  SOFC  anode  compartment  without
being fully converted to syngas, several possible reaction pathways may
occur, as shown in Fig. 3. The reaction kinetics are quite complicated in
SOFC  anodes  and  include  the  interaction  of  heterogeneous  electro-
chemical/chemical reactions on the metal (Ni/reforming catalyst) sur-
face and the potential homogeneous reactions in anode flow channels
and pores [37–39]. Although homogeneous reactions can be neglected
for  SOFCs  fueled  with  methane  at  normal  operating  temperatures
(approximately 800
C), the  pyrolysis and oxidation of  higher  hydro-
carbons should be taken into account [40]. Small molecules and radicals
are produced from homogeneous reactions of fuels. The homogeneous
reactions in the gas phase and the heterogeneous reactions at the cata-
lytic  surface  are  coupled  through  the  adsorption/desorption  of

intermediates and radicals [41]. Radicals may adsorb on the catalyti-
cally  active  sites  and  further  participate  in  heterogeneous  reactions.
Then, the intermediates and products from the heterogeneous reactions
desorb  from the  catalytic  surface  and  participate  in  the  gas-phase  re-
actions. In addition, the intermediates from homogenous reactions and
heterogeneous  thermocatalytic  reactions  can  possibly  also  transfer  to
the triple-phase boundary (TPB) through surface diffusion and finally
react  with  the  oxygen  ions  transported  from  the  electrolyte  through
electrochemical reactions.

H2 + O2(cid:0) → H2O + 2e(cid:0)

CO + O2(cid:0) → CO2 + 2e(cid:0)

(6)

Steam  and  CO2,  which  are  major  products  of  electrochemical  re-
actions, can further drive steam reforming, dry reforming and water gas
shift (WGS) reactions on the anode Ni surface or even undergo further
reactions in the gas phase.

The electrochemically  active  species produced from the  reforming
process then transfer from the catalyst surface to the TPB through sur-
face diffusion. Although some simulation studies have considered sur-
face diffusion processes [42,43], the role of surface diffusion is still not
entirely known, especially when various electrochemically active spe-
cies exist [44]. When the electrochemically active species reach the TPB,
electrochemical  oxidation  then  occurs.  In  early  studies,  the  electro-
chemical  oxidation  kinetics  were  described  using  the  Bulter-Volmer
equation,  assuming  that  H2  is  the  only  electrochemically  active  spe-
cies.  Although  H2  electrochemical  oxidation  kinetics  are  proven  to
proceed much faster than that of CO, the CO electrochemical conversion
may become nonnegligible and act as a parallel charge-transfer pathway
to H2 oxidation under some conditions. A detailed discussion of the H2
and CO electrochemical oxidation kinetics lies outside the scope of this
article but can be found in previous reviews [45,46].

The utilization of hydrocarbon fuels leads to carbon deposition and
further  leads  to  severe  degradation  of  performance  of  the  SOFC  Ni
anode. Thus, carbon deposition remains a large obstacle for the long-
term  operation  and  commercial  application  of  SOFCs  with  hydrocar-
bon fuels. Carbon can be produced either from heterogeneous reactions
over  the  catalyst  or  from  gas-phase  homogeneous  reactions.  For  the
heterogeneous  route,  the  reactions  leading  to  carbon  formation  are
mainly the decomposition of hydrocarbons and the Boudouard reaction.

2CO → C + CO2

(8)

The  carbon  formation process  on  the  catalyst  surface  involves  the
deposition of a carbon source, the dissolution of carbon into the metal
bulk and the precipitation of carbon at the catalyst surface [47].

In addition to the heterogeneous route, carbon can also be formed
through gas-phase reactions, in which case carbon is known as soot. The
formation of soot is initialized by C–C bond scission at high tempera-
tures and involves the formation of precursors (such as C2H4 and C2H2),
the recombination of precursors to form polycyclic aromatic hydrocar-
bons (PAHs), and the growth and agglomeration of PAHs to form soot
particles [48]. Soot will then further condense and precipitate on the
catalytic surface, which leads to carbon deposition. The structures of the
deposited carbon from the two different routes are found to be different.
The carbon from heterogeneous reactions occurs mainly in the form of
graphitic  fibers,  while  the  carbon  from  homogeneous  reactions  is
amorphous. The contributions of both routes to carbon deposition are
typically dependent on the fuel type, catalyst type and operation con-
ditions. Since the C–H bonds in CH4  are much stronger than the C–C
bonds in heavier hydrocarbons, the carbon deposition is mainly from the
heterogeneous  route  for  methane  at  the  typical  SOFC  operation  tem-
peratures  (<1000  K).  However,  for  higher  hydrocarbons  such  as
iso-octane, the gas-phase pyrolysis route of carbon formation cannot be
ignored.  A  simulation  study  by  Sheng  et  al.  suggested  that  H2O  can
remove the carbon filaments formed by surface reactions but does not
take part in the gas-phase reactions, thus showing no obvious effect on
preventing carbon formation from gas-phase reactions [40]. In addition,
applying a polarization current can help remove the surface coke due to
the increased oxygen flux from the cathode to the anode side.

2.1.2.

In situ optical characterization for anode kinetic studies

As  outlined  in  Section  2.1.1,  the  chemical  and  electrochemical
mechanisms  occurring  at  the  anode  are  quite  complicated  when  hy-
drocarbons serve as the fuel source. Given the high operating temper-
atures  and  sealing  requirements  of  SOFCs,  capturing  changes  in
components  and  probing  chemistry  during  operation  presents  consid-
erable challenges. Thus, anode kinetics are primarily inferred through
the  overall  electrochemical  performance  and  analysis  of  outlet  gas
compositions, often with the support of kinetic models. More recently,
several in situ and operando optical techniques have been developed to
facilitate  direct  and  noninvasive  measurements  of  temperature  distri-
butions, intermediate gas species, and surface species under the elevated
operating  temperatures  of  SOFCs.  These  advanced  techniques  offer

technique  proves

Near-infrared  thermal  imaging  (NIRTI),  as  depicted  in  Fig.  4  (a),
offers  the  ability  to  measure  thermal  variations  on  the  anode  surface
with an impressive spatial resolution of approximately 0.1 mm, a tem-
perature resolution of approximately 0.1
C and 200 ms temporal res-
olution  [49].  This  advanced
in
distinguishing various chemical processes with distinct thermal effects.
For instance, when transitioning the anode gas from H2/Ar to C3H8/Ar,
the temperature of the Ni/YSZ (yttria stabilized zirconia) anode expe-
rienced  an  immediate  drop,  signifying  rapid  carbon  deposition  [49].
NIRTI has enabled a comparative analysis of carbon removal processes
using  oxygen,  steam,  and  electrochemical  oxidation,  with  spatial  dis-
tributions  revealing  varying  rates  of  NiO  formation.  The  temperature
distributions and variations recorded through NIRTI provide valuable
insights  into  the  primary  reactions  with  differing  thermal  effects.
However,  to  comprehensively  understand  the  possible  reaction  path-
ways  and  kinetics,  additional  information  on  chemical  species  is
required.

In situ Fourier-transform infrared emission (FTIR) spectroscopy and
Raman  scattering  both  rely  on  vibrational  spectroscopy  to  identify
typical  species  associated  with  high-temperature  electrochemical  pro-
cesses. In the case of in situ FTIR spectroscopy (Fig. 4 (b)), it exhibits
sensitivity to gas-phase oxidation products such as CO2 and CO, as well
as intermediate adsorbed species such as CO2(ads)  [50]. In contrast, in
situ  surface  Raman  spectroscopy  is  highly  sensitive  to  carbonaceous
species  and  has  been  extensively  employed  to  differentiate  between
various  forms  of  carbon  bonding.  The  detection  of  the  D-band  corre-
sponds  to  amorphous  carbon,  while  that  of  the  G-band  represents
graphite carbon, as illustrated in Fig. 4 (c) [51]. The high time resolution
of approximately 1s offered by FTIR and Raman spectroscopy enables
the rapid detection of species dynamics, facilitating in-depth investiga-
tion of anode reaction mechanisms.

Recently, in situ powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) has been employed
to directly monitor changes in the crystal structure of Ni when exposed
to CH4  at temperatures of 650 and 800
C. These observed structural
alterations  have  provided  valuable  insights  into  the  deactivation
mechanisms  of  Ni-YSZ  cermet  at  different  temperatures.  It  has  been
◦
speculated that at 650
C, deactivation results from the growth of carbon
fibers, while at 800

C, it occurs due to carbon accumulation [52].

Through the utilization of in situ optical techniques, either individ-
ually or in combination, a deeper understanding of chemical and ma-
terial  processes  can  be  obtained,  particularly  regarding  the  coking
mechanism, a significant degradation factor when heavy hydrocarbons
are used as fuel. In comparison to ex situ approaches, in situ techniques
enable the detection of deposited and removed  carbon compounds in

real  time  during  operation  and  have  been  extensively  used  in  recent
years  [53].  Generally,  it  has  been  observed  that  carbon  deposition  is
more pronounced when using heavier hydrocarbons than that with the
lighter ones [54]. The disparities in the quantity and type of carbon, as
stated in Section 2.1.1, have been corroborated by Pomfret et al. through
in situ Raman studies [51], as illustrated in Fig. 4 (c). Leveraging in situ
Raman spectroscopy, the carbon removal process was investigated on a
Ni/YSZ surface fueled with CH4 at various overpotentials [55–57]. The
suppression of the “G” peak at an overpotential of 0.6 V suggested that
graphite formation was inhibited by the polarization current.

Although many studies have concluded that carbon formation pref-
erentially occurs on the Ni surface than YSZ [58], determining the exact
initiation  point  of  the  coking  reaction  in  SOFC  anodes  has  proven
challenging  owing  to  the  complex  porous  structure  of  the  anode.  To
overcome  this  obstacle,  a  patterned  Ni  anode  with  a  well-defined
boundary  was  designed  and  employed  in  place  of  a  porous  electrode
[59], as illustrated in Fig. 5. This patterned anode facilitated the expo-
sure of the reaction site and enabled the detection of the precise location
of carbon deposition through in situ Raman spectroscopy. By mapping
the carbon signals on the patterned anode, it was established that the
Ni-YSZ interface represents the most active site for carbon deposition
and removal when fueled with C3H8 [60]. Fig. 5 further illustrates that
the  accumulated  hydrocarbons  at  the  interface  react  with  oxygen
transferred  from  the  cathode  side,  resulting  in  the  oxidation  of  these
hydrocarbons to CO and H2O upon the application of current. This ul-
timately leads to a reduction in deposited carbon.

Given the distinct advantages of different methods, a combination of
the  aforementioned  techniques  can  yield  a  more  comprehensive  un-
derstanding of the mechanisms governing anode behavior when fueled
with hydrocarbons [57,61]. By combining NIRTI and Raman and FTIR
spectroscopy, researchers have studied the intertwined effects of surface
reforming,  carbon  deposition,  and  electrochemical  oxidation  on  cell
performance in greater detail [62,63]. Furthermore, the capabilities of
these techniques can be further enhanced, and novel methods can be
developed. For example, surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS)
has demonstrated the ability to enhance the sensitivity of surface species
detection, allowing for the identification of carbon deposition at early
stages [64]. The use of Ag nanoparticles coated with a SiO2 shell as SERS
◦
enhancers has enabled robust operation at temperatures of 400–450
C
[65].  However,  further  exploration  of  nanoparticles  with  optimized
geometries or alternative coating materials is necessary to ensure the
stability  of  SERS  at  higher  temperatures.  Moreover,  more  recent  ad-
vancements  have  allowed  the  utilization  of  ambient  pressure  X-ray
photoelectron  spectroscopy  (APXPS)  in  SOFC  studies  to  elucidate  the
chemical  states  of  materials  and  species  during  electrochemical

pressure range of APXPS (typically less than 100 mbar for SOFC studies
[67]) to enable its application under real operational conditions.

2.2. Fuel tolerance enhancement by anode development

As  discussed  in  Section  2.1,  Ni-based  anodes  can  facilitate  fast
reforming  kinetics;  however,  they  cause  the  rapid  breakdown  of  C–C
bonds, resulting in severe carbon deposition [1]. Consequently, several
strategies  have  been  proposed  to  modify  traditional  Ni  anodes  and
enhance  their  tolerance  to  heavier  hydrocarbons.  One  commonly
employed approach is the addition of an extra catalytic layer to promote
hydrocarbon reforming to H2  and CO. Another method involves modi-
fying the surface of the traditional Ni-based anode by infiltrating it with
different  materials.  Additionally,  novel  materials,  particularly  perov-
skite  materials,  have  been  developed  to  enhance  anode  carbon

resistance.

Addition of an extra catalytic layer.Fig. 6 (a)). Ru–CeO2 was among the
first  materials  utilized  as  an  anode  reforming  layer  owing  to  its  high
activity in the partial oxidation of methane [68], propane [69,70], and
iso-octane [71]. The integration of the Ru–CeO2 layer led to a significant
improvement in power density, which increased from <10 to 160 mW

C when fueled
with  propane  [72].  Furthermore,  the  addition  of  the  Ru–CeO2  layer
enabled 60 h of stable operation on iso-octane/air mixtures at 590
C,
whereas cell performance without the catalyst layer decreased by 37 %
over 23 h [71]. More recently, a NiMo-ceria-zirconia catalyst layer was
applied atop the Ni-YSZ anode, demonstrating high catalytic activity in
reforming an iso-octane/air mixture at a fuel conversion rate of >80 %
and  high  yields  of  H2  (~70  %)  and  CO  (~80  %)  [73,74].  The  cell
degradation rate in the real gasoline/air operation mode decreased from

[75].  By  packing  the  catalyst  inside  a  tubular  channel,  instead  of
creating a reforming layer on top of a button cell, both catalyst loading
and  reforming  performance  were  improved,  resulting  in  more  stable
operation for up to 15 h [75].

Adding other materials into Ni-based anode. Numerous strategies have
been proposed to modify conventional Ni-based anodes [76], including
impregnating  noble  metals  [77],  introducing  ceria  and  other  oxygen

storage  materials  [78],  and  increasing  alkalinity  [79],  among  others.
The surface modification of Ni-based anodes with noble metals such as
Ru,  Rh,  Pt,  and  Pd  has  been  found  to  accelerate  the  hydrocarbon
reforming  reaction,  as  illustrated  in  Fig.  6(b).  For  instance,  when
Pd–Ni-YSZ was used instead of Ni-YSZ for butane steam reforming, the
maximum power density (MPD) increased from approximately 800 to

C [80]. However, it should be noted that the reported
high power density at low temperatures was achieved due to the rela-
tively thin electrolyte with a YSZ/gadolinia-doped ceria (GDC) bilayer
of 1 μm and 200 nm. When GDC is used as the catalyst support instead of
YSZ, the deactivation of the Ni catalyst can be prevented as the good
oxygen exchange capability of GDC helps preserve the activity of the
catalytic partial oxidation (CPOx) reaction sites [81]. Adding alkaline
oxides to Ni-based anodes, such as BaO (as shown Fig. 6(c)), can increase
surface basicity, which, in turn, can deaccelerate C–C cracking reactions.
This promotes water adsorption on the surface and accelerates carbon
removal, particularly in the presence of BaO on the surface [82].

Perovskite-based anode materials. Perovskite materials have emerged
as efficient alternative to Ni-based anode materials for SOFCs fueled by

higher hydrocarbons, showing promise in terms of carbon tolerance [83,
84]. However, the perovskite anode cells typically exhibit lower power
density than Ni-based anodes owing to their lower catalytic activity and
electrical  conductivity.  Recently,  a  promising  method  has  been
demonstrated  to  enhance  the  activity  of  perovskite  anodes  while
maintaining high carbon resistance. This approach involves the in situ
exclusion  of  catalyst  nanoparticles  from  the  crystal  structure  of  the
perovskite support [85], as illustrated in Fig. 6(d). By simultaneously
exsolving CeO2, SrO, and Ru nanoparticles from the SrFeO3 perovskite,

with  the  FeRu  alloy  in  situ  exsolved  from  Ruddlesden-Popper  oxides
[87]. Furthermore, it has been observed that the exclusion of traditional
Ni catalysts leads to higher resistance to coking than that to the depo-
sition of Ni nanoparticles [88]. The exsolution of active Ni nanoparticles
from the crystal structure of yttrium-doped barium zirconate (BZY) has
been shown to enhance carbon tolerance when fueled with various hy-
drocarbons, including propane, n-butane, i-butane, and iso-octane [2].
The exsolved Ni nanoparticles, with diameters of <100 nm, provide a
large  surface  area,  reducing  the  distance  for  the  spillover  of
oxygen-related  species  to  the  Ni  surface  and  thereby  increasing  the
carbon removal reaction rate [2].

Comparison between various strategies. Table 2 provides a summary of
the electrochemical performance and stability characteristics of higher-
hydrocarbon-fueled SOFCs, while Fig. 7 shows the MPD and operational

durability achieved through some promising strategies at various tem-
peratures. In general, it can be observed that as temperature increases,
the MPD tends to increase while the operational durability decreases.
Among  the  existing  technologies,  the  addition  of  a  reforming  layer
stands out for its high fuel flexibility and wide temperature adaptability.
It  enables  the  internal  reforming  of  propane,  butane,  iso-octane,  and
even  petrol  in  the  temperature  range  of  500–750
C.  However,  co-
feeding  an  additional  oxidant  (usually  air)  with  hydrocarbons  is
required to achieve sufficient reforming, which may be unfavorable for
electrochemical  performance  and  necessitates  oxidant  management.
Utilizing perovskite materials or alloying Ni with other elements allows
for the direct utilization of higher hydrocarbons. Traditional perovskite
anodes  are  particularly  suitable  for  high-temperature  operation
(750–850
C), resulting in higher power densities. In contrast, alloying

Ni  with  noble  metal  catalysts  provides  a  method  for  utilizing  higher
◦
hydrocarbons at intermediate temperatures of ~600
C. Furthermore, a
combination of the use of proton-conductive perovskite materials (e.g.,
BZY) with the in situ exsolution of Ni nanoparticles enables the utili-
zation of various wet hydrocarbons, ranging from propane to iso-octane,
at 600
C for over 3000 h. Except for the decreased spillover distance
caused by the Ni nanoparticle, BZY is considered to contribute to H2O
dissociation to form OH(s) and facilities the carbon removal processes
[2]. This strategy demonstrates high stability and fuel flexibility at low
temperatures, making it a feasible option for future applications. How-
ever, it is important to note that steam is still required to provide an
amount of steam to generate OH(s) for carbon removal in this approach.

2.3. Direct utilization of nitrogen-bearing compounds

While hydrocarbons have been extensively investigated as fuels for
portable SOFCs, the issue of coking remains a significant challenge for
traditional Ni anodes. In recent years, nitrogen-bearing compounds such
as  ammonia and  hydrazine have  attracted increasing  attention as  po-
tential fuels for portable SOFCs owing to their carbon-free characteris-
tics.  The  feasibility  of  using  NH3  as  an  SOFC  fuel  was  initially
demonstrated in the 1980s [105]. Till now, NH3 has been used as a fuel
in SOFCs based on both oxygen-ion-conductive electrolytes (O–SOFCs)
and proton-conductive electrolytes (H–SOFCs). Regardless of the elec-
trolyte type, the oxidation of ammonia at the anode was found to occur
in two stages [106]. NH3  is first decomposed to N2  and H2  on the Ni
catalyst,  followed  by  the  electrochemical  oxidation  of  the  generated
hydrogen for power generation, as illustrated in Fig. 8. Importantly, the
endothermic decomposition reaction allows for the absorption of heat
generated  in  the  anode,  facilitating  temperature  control  [107].  In
addition, the ammonia-fueled SOFC system was found to be more effi-
cient than the equivalent hydrogen-fueled system owing to the cooling
effect induced by ammonia decomposition.

Through thermodynamic analysis, Ni et al. concluded that H–SOFCs
have  a  theoretically  higher  maximum  efficiency  than  O–SOFCs  when
fueled with NH3 [108]. However, most experimental results have shown
that  high  power  densities  are  achieved  with  O–SOFCs  owing  to  their
high  ion  conductivities  at  high  temperatures.  In  the  intermediate  to
◦
low-temperature  range  (400–600
C),  H–SOFCs  are  advantageous
because the conductivity of proton-conductive electrolytes is compara-
C. It is
ble to that of typical oxygen-ion-conductive electrolytes at 800
worth noting that toxic NOx can be produced through the oxidation of
NH3  by O2(cid:0)
at higher temperatures and currents when using O–SOFCs
[20,109].

◦
At lower temperatures approximately 600

C, NO was reported to be
undetectable in the anode off-gas when using NH3 as a fuel source [110].
Extensive research has been conducted on NH3-fed SOFCs, exploring
various anode and electrolyte materials. A comprehensive review pro-
vides a detailed summary of the materials developed for NH3-fed SOFCs
[111]; some results are presented in Fig. 9. It should be noted that in
for  the  performance  of
Fig.  9  (b),  solid  data  points  stand
anode-supported  cells  while  hollow  points  stand
for  that  of
electrolyte-supported cells. As depicted in Fig. 9 (a), the performance of
the NH3-fed SOFCs can reach that of the hydrogen-fed SOFCs at tem-
peratures  of  >600
C  because  ammonia  can  rapidly  and  completely
decompose  to  hydrogen  and  nitrogen.  The  catalytic  activity  toward
ammonia decomposition is dependent on the catalyst’s ability of NH3
adsorption and N2 desorption [112]. In addition to traditional Ni-based
anodes, several transition metals with high metal-nitrogen binding en-
ergy have been alloyed with Ni or used in place of Ni to promote NH3
adsorption.  For  example,  Co  and  Fe  have  been  introduced  to  Ni-YSZ
anodes,  enabling  NH3-fed  SOFCs  to  achieve  peak  power  densities
equivalent  to  those  of  H2-fed  SOFCs  at  temperatures  of  650–800
C

MPDs achieved upon using the NH3  fuel are typically <40 % of those
achieved upon using the hydrogen fuel for traditional O–SOFCs. In the
last decade, novel anode materials have been developed to enhance NH3
decomposition  at  low  temperatures.  For  Ni-based  anodes,  several
proton-conductive materials have been employed as a support for Ni,
such  as  BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-δ  (BZCY),  and  have  demonstrated  higher
catalytic performance than traditional oxygen-conductive oxides such as
GDC and YSZ at temperatures of <600
C. This improvement is attrib-
uted to the larger number of basic sites, which favor NH3 adsorption and
N2 desorption. Using the Ni-BZCY anode, the ratio of MPDNH3 to MPDH2
reached 48 % [115]. More recently, a new proton-conductive electro-
lyte,  Pd-doped  Ba(Zr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1)0.95Pd0.05O3-δ  (BZCYYbPd),  was
developed,  and  the  Ni-BZCYYbPd  anode  exhibited  excellent  catalytic
activity toward NH3  decomposition and H2  electrochemical reactions.

Except for ammonia, hydrazine was also considered as the fuel for
mobile  applications.  Liquid  hydrazine  can  be  selectively  decomposed
into N2 and H2 at the SOFC anode in situ, using BSCF as a catalyst at a
◦
low temperature of 450
C [125]. The cell showed a similar performance
operating on hydrazine decomposition products to that obtained with
hydrogen, which is higher than that acquired from a similar cell with
ammonia  as  fuel.  In  general,  although  nitrogen-bearing  compounds
have  been  considered  alternative  SOFC  fuels  for  mobile  and  portable
applications, research in this field is still in the infant stage, which fo-
cuses on single-cell performance tests and material optimization. Few
stack-level  studies  could  be  found  with  ammonia  or  hydrazine-fueled
SOFCs [126,127].

3. Achieving rapid start-up

For portable and mobile power generators, achieving rapid start-up
is  crucial,  and  significant  efforts  have  been  made  at  the  cell  level  to
address this challenge. One direct approach to mitigate this problem is
to lower the operating temperature of SOFCs. Moreover, enhancing the
thermal shock resistance of SOFCs enables them to be heated at a high
rate,  further  reducing  start-up  times.  This  can  be  achieved  through
optimization of the configurations and geometries of SOFCs.

3.1. Rapid start-up by lowering the operating temperature

◦

Reducing the operating temperature of SOFCs from the typical range
of  800–1000
C  to  intermediate  temperatures  (600–800
C)  or  even
lower  (below  600

start-up and thermal cycling. Fig. 10 illustrates a typical SOFC operating
temperature  profile  during  the  start-up  process  [128].  Initially,  the
SOFC stack is heated by an external heat source, such as hot air. As the
SOFC stack reaches an intermediate temperature of approximately 600
◦
C, the rate of temperature increase gradually decreases owing to the
reduced  temperature  difference  between  the  SOFC  stack  and  hot  air.
This  results  in  a  prolonged  heating-up  time.  Therefore,  lowering  the
SOFC  operating  temperature  to  <600
C  can  effectively  reduce  the
start-up time.

However,  it  is  worth  noting  that  although  lowering  the  operating
temperature enhances rapid start-up, it increases ohmic and polarization
losses,  resulting  in  a  significant  reduction  in  power  density.  This
reduction  in  power  density  is  a  critical  challenge  to  overcome  when
aiming  for  rapid  start-up  under  intermediate  temperature  conditions
while  maintaining  acceptable  thermal  shock  resistance,  especially  for
mobile applications.

The ohmic loss in electrolytes contributes significantly to total losses
at  low  temperatures.  A  prevalent  approach  is  employing  a  thin  elec-

Alternatively, developing electrolyte materials with high ionic con-

polarization loss becomes the dominant factor, especially at low tem-

owing to the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at

optimization.  One  recent  advancement  in  addressing  the  cathode  po-
larization  loss  is  the  development  of  a  highly  active  and  robust  1D

nanofiber  morphology,  researchers  have  designed  and  fabricated  3D
fibrous  architectures  using  a  template-derived  method  [143–145],  as
depicted in Fig. 12(a) and (b). Compared to conventional sponge-like

3.2. Improvement of thermal shock resistance

To realize the rapid start-up of SOFCs, it is essential to improve their
thermal shock resistance, which can be accomplished through modifi-
cations to the SOFC configurations. In general, metal-supported SOFCs
demonstrate superior thermal shock resistance to traditional ceramic-
supported  configurations  owing  to  the  higher  mechanical  strength  of
the metal support. Additionally, optimizing the geometries of SOFCs can
enhance their thermal shock resistance.

3.2.1. Metal-supported SOFCs

Over  the  past  few  decades,  significant  research  and  development
have  been  focused  on  metal-supported  SOFCs  (MS-SOFCs)  owing  to
their  superior  thermal  shock  resistance.  Compared  to  the  use  of  con-
ventional ceramic supports in SOFCs, metal supports allow substantial
improvements  in  the  mechanical  strength  of  the  fuel  cells  [146].
Moreover, metal supports have a thermal conductivity more than four
times  that  of  ceramic  supports  [147].  This  high  thermal  conductivity
significantly  reduces  internal  temperature  gradients  and  mitigates
thermal  stress  during  the  heating  process  [148],  allowing  for  rapid
start-up [149]. Fig. 13 compares the thermal shock resistance between

ing  at  a  rate  of  ~500
noticeable reduction in the OCV after just two cycles, accompanied by
the formation of visible cracks. In contrast, the MS-SOFC maintained a
stable open circuit voltage (OCV) for over 30 rapid thermal cycles. The
outstanding  thermal  shock  resistance  of  the  MS-SOFC  ensures  that
multiple rapid start-ups in mobile applications will not result in damage
to the SOFC stack.

Very recently, the thermal shock resistance of MS-SOFCs was eval-
uated and tested under harsh start-up conditions using a flame fuel cell
(FFC) configuration [151]. In this setup, the MS-SOFC is directly heated
by an open flame, achieving a start-up time of less than 1 min, signifi-
cantly shorter than that achieved in conventional portable SOFC systems
[170]. The MS-SOFC underwent more than 10 extremely rapid thermal

The metal support plays a crucial role in the operation of MS-SOFCs;
it must meet several strict requirements related to physical properties,
such  as  low  cost,  high  mechanical  strength,  excellent  oxidation  resis-
tance, and high electron conductivity. Furthermore, one key factor for
achieving high thermal shock resistance in MS-SOFCs is the match of the
coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) between the metal support and
electrolyte [171]. This match allows the electrolyte to expand or con-
tract  synchronously  with  the  metal  support  during  rapid  thermal
cycling,  preventing  the  formation  of  micro-cracks.  Metal-support  ma-
terials primarily fall into two categories: Ni- and Fe-based alloys [171].
Table 3 lists the properties of some candidate metal-support materials.
Although some groups have used pure Ni [172,173] or Ni-based alloys
[174] as metal supports, their higher CTE than that of the electrolyte
limits  their  application.  Fe-based  metals  are  the  most  widely  used
metal-support materials owing to their matched CTE and low cost. For
example, Zhang et al. [175] utilized 430 steel as a metal support and
prepared  functional layers through thermal spraying. This  system did
not  degrade  when  it  was  subjected  to  a  temperature  of  650
C  at  a
(cid:0) 2  for over 600 h, demonstrating a good
current density of 350 mA cm
match between 430 steel and SOFC functional layers. Additionally, the
CTE  of  Fe-based  alloys  can  be  adjusted  by  adding  a  small  amount  of
ceramic additives with a low CTE, such as aluminum titanate [153], to
achieve complete matching with the electrolyte layer.

◦

◦

Co-sintering  is  a  typical  method  for  fabricating  MS-SOFCs  [171].
However, due to the presence of a metal support, co-sintering is more
challenging  for  the  fabrication  of  MS-SOFCs  than  conventional
ceramic-supported SOFCs. Generally, to achieve the complete densifi-
◦
cation of the electrolyte layer, sintering temperatures exceeding 1200
C
are  required;  temperatures  of  >1400
C  are  commonly  employed  for
YSZ electrolytes [176]. To prevent the excessive oxidation of the metal
support, it is necessary to conduct the sintering process in an inert or
reductive atmosphere. High temperature can also lead to the interdif-
fusion of elements such as Fe and Cr in the metal support with Ni in the
anode  layer  [177],  causing  a  decrease  in  power  density  and  rapid
degradation  [156].  To  mitigate  this  issue,  an  intermediate  layer
composed of LDC and steel is introduced between the metal support and
anode layer [178]; however, this configuration complicates the fabri-
cation  process.  Additionally,  the  cathode  must  be  sintered  in  a  weak
reducing  atmosphere  to  prevent  the  oxidation  of  the  metal  support.
Conventional  perovskite  cathodes,  such  as  LSM,  can  be  decomposed
under reducing conditions [156], further reducing cell performance.

Recently,  sintering-free  MS-SOFC  fabrication  methods  have  been
developed,  including  thermal  spraying  [179,180]  and  physical  vapor
deposition  (PVD)  [181,182].  Thermal  spraying  is  a  cost-effective
approach  for  SOFC  fabrication  [183],  and  cells  produced  using  this
method  exhibit  excellent  thermal  shock  resistance  during  thermal
cycling. For example, Wang et al. [131] fabricated an MS-SOFC with an
SDC electrolyte through thermal spraying. The cell showed no structural

ohmic loss [184]. However, the high cost of PVD limits its large-scale
application [185].

3.2.2. Modification of traditional geometries

C  min

Over the past decades, two major SOFC geometries, namely, planar
and tubular SOFCs, have been developed, as shown in Fig. 14(a) and (b).
Planar SOFCs are characterized by easy fabrication, simple construction,
and  high  power  density  owing  to  their  short  current  collection  path.
However, traditional planar SOFCs require very long start-up times and
(cid:0) 1)  to  avoid  thermal
low  heating/cooling  rates  (typically  1–2
stresses [186]. Although the tubular type has a lower power density, it is
advantageous in terms of mechanical and thermal cycling stability due
to  its  symmetric  circular  nature,  which  allows  for  fast  radial-to-axial
heat  transfer  [187].  In  mobile  applications,  SOFC  stacks  are  required
to  possess  both  high  power  density  and  good  thermal  shock
resistance—a requirement that cannot be met by traditional planar or
tubular design. Therefore, mT-SOFCs with a diameter of several milli-
meters (shown in Fig. 14 (c)) have been well developed in the last two
decades owing to their potential to enhance the thermal shock resistance
and  volumetric  power  density  of  conventional  tubular  systems
[188–191].  More  recently,  a  novel  flat-tube  SOFC,  featuring  a  cross
design that combines elements of planar and tubular SOFCs, as shown in
Fig.  14(d),  was  also  developed  to  achieve  improvements  in  thermal
shock resistance and volumetric power density.

Fig.  15  shows  the  number  of  thermal  cycles  and  heating  rate  of
SOFCs  with  different  geometries.  The  number  of  thermal  cycles  for
planar SOFCs, tubular SOFCs, and mT-SOFCs ranges from 10 to 1000,
showing no significant difference. The largest number of thermal cycles,
2500,  was  achieved  by  the  metal-supported  planar  SOFC  stack  fabri-
cated  by  Ceres  Power  [192].  However,  considering  that  after  the  re-
ported  maximum  thermal  cycle  number,  no  structural  failure  was
observed  and  the  tested  SOFCs  still  maintained  satisfactory  perfor-
mance,  the  thermal  cycling  durability  of  the  planar,  tubular,  and
microtubular SOFCs still needs further investigation. The thermal shock
resistance  of  SOFCs  is  also  evaluated  using  the  heating  rate.  Conven-
tional planar and tubular SOFCs generally operate at heating rates of
(cid:0) 1, requiring several hours for the start-up

time  from  hours  to  minutes  and  even  seconds  [193].  Therefore,
mT-SOFCs possess the highest thermal shock resistance, making them a
promising  candidate  for  mobile  applications.  As  shown  in  Fig.  16,
Kendall  et  al.  revealed  a  strong  dependence  (almost  d3  power  law
relationship) of the thermal shock resistance on the diameter of tubular
SOFCs [194]. A 1000-fold improvement in the start-up performance was
achieved when the tube diameter was decreased from 25 to 2 mm.

issues.

4. Achieving SOFC stack compactness

4.1. Comparison of stack designs

To meet the unique requirements of the mobility sector, stack inte-
gration techniques (e.g., current collection, and thermal management)
to achieve stack compactness and high volumetric power densities are
also vital. The stack typically contains multiple duplicate fuel cell units
and  interconnectors,  sealing  components,  gas  distribution  and  aggre-
gation manifolds, and possibly thermal insulated shells. A more compact
layout  places  greater  demands  on  the  design  of  these  components.
Furthermore,  an  increase  in  the  volumetric  power  density  leads  to
intensive heat generation, while the compact integration weakens the
heat dissipation. This generates hot spots and thermal stress within the
stack, which further leads to the structural and functional failure due to

As  emphasized  in  Section  3,  both  high  power  density  and  good
thermal shock resistance are needed for SOFC stacks. The start-up and
thermal  cycling  performances  of  cells  with  novel  geometries  were
compared  and  analyzed  in  the  last  section,  with  a  focus  on  cell-level
development. In this section, the stacking issues for several promising
aforementioned  geometries  are  discussed,  with  a  focus  on  the  volu-
metric  power  density  at  the  stack  level.  The  geometric  differences
among  fuel  cell  designs  can  significantly  impact  sealing  and  current
collection  methods,  ultimately  affecting  the  integration  process  and
stack compactness.

also  showed  that  the  stack  volumetric  power  density  scales  with  the
reciprocal  of the  diameter  [194,200].  Thus, mT-SOFCs exhibit  higher
power  densities  than  classic  tubular  SOFCs.  Suzuki  et  al.  developed
submillimeter  "pin-like"  mT-SOFCs  and  integrated  them  into  a  micro-
(cid:0) 1 [130,
stack, achieving a stack volume power density exceeding 2 kW L
204,205].  To  further  decrease  the  weight  and  volume  of  mT-SOFC
stacks, researchers have extensively worked on hollow-fiber mT-SOFCs
by combining spinning/phase inversion and sintering techniques. This
approach  results  in  a  thinner  wall  thickness,  reduced  polarization
resistance  and  increased  power  density  [206].  For  instance,  a  high
(cid:0) 2  was  achieved  with  hollow  fiber
power  density  of  1.21  W  cm
mT-SOFCs operating at 600

C using pure hydrogen as fuel [207].

◦

The primary technical challenge when integrating mT-SOFC stacks is
efficient  current  collection  from  interior  electrodes.  To  address  this,
several techniques have been proposed, broadly categorized into three
groups,  as  shown  in  Fig.  17.  The  first  involves  exposing  parts  of  the
interior electrodes by leaving small areas in rings and strips uncovered
by the electrolyte layer [7,208,209]. This approach simplifies current
collection in modules or stacks but leads to a longer current transfer path
and  a  reduced  effective  area.  The  second  strategy  includes  adding  a
conductive  functional  layer,  such  as  nickel,  inside  the  anode  layer  to
serve  as  the  current  collector  [210,211].  This  layer  directs  current
collection from the anode side, shortening the current transfer path but
complicating  the  fabrication  process.  The  third  method  involves
embedding a current collector (such as nickel mesh [212], nickel felt
[213], or nickel wire [214]) within the anode surface to ensure direct
contact.  While  this  approach  simplifies  fabrication,  it  may  introduce
mechanical stress in the cell due to the proximity of the components. In a
recent  study,  a  wire  brush  was  inserted  into  the  interior  anode of  an
mT-SOFC to ensure close and stable contact between the wires and the
anode  surface  [215–217].  This  metal  wire  brush  also  demonstrated
feasibility as a catalyst carrier for internal reforming processes, offering
a compact design for using hydrocarbon fuels [215].

In addition to mT-SOFC stacks, several other stack designs have also
been proposed to realize the goals of high volumetric power density and
good thermal shock resistance. As shown in Fig. 18 (a), in a honeycomb
stack, the characteristics of the tubular and flat designs are merged. The
interior surfaces of the honeycomb-shaped electrolytes are coated with
anode  or  cathode  layers  to  create  air  and  fuel  channels  [218].  The
honeycomb  design  offers  a  combination  of  high  mechanical  strength,
due to the effective load distribution and high volumetric power density
due to the extensive volumetric electrode area. For example, the volu-
metric  power  density  reached  600  W  L
C  for  an
LSGM-electrolyte-supported cell [219]. However, the thick electrolyte
wall in electrolyte-supported honeycomb cells limits further improve-
ments due to the high ohmic resistance.

(cid:0) 1  at  800

By modifying the cell structure of electrode-supported honeycomb

cells, the volumetric power density can be increased to as high as 2 kW
(cid:0) 1  [220].  In  anode-supported  honeycomb  cells,  the  arrangement  of
L
flow  channels  plays  a  crucial  role  in  determining  the  output  power
density due to the 3D fuel transport and distribution within the porous
anode support [218]. More recently, Li et al. combined the character-
istics  of  microtubular  and  honeycomb  designs  to  create  a  6-channel
honeycomb anode-supported  mT-SOFC  with  an outer  diameter  of  2.2
mm, as shown in Fig. 18 (b), achieving an MPD of 2.27 W cm
C
when fueled with hydrogen [221,222]. Future research on honeycomb
SOFCs should prioritize optimizing geometric structures, such as chan-
nel  arrangement,  wall  thickness,  and  channel  size,  to  achieve  even
higher  volumetric  power  densities  and  improved  thermal  shock
resistance.

A cone-shaped SOFC stack, as shown in Fig. 18(c), has been proposed
to ease the problem of cell connection in a tubular SOFC stack. The cells
are  stacked  by  fitting  one  cone  into  another,  with  interconnectors
serving  as  seals  and  current  collectors.  This  stacking  structure  also
functions  as  a  self-supporting  tubular  structure,  providing  excellent
thermal  stability.  Additionally,  a  compact  cone-shaped  stack  can
generate higher power output within a small volume. The concept for
this design was initially proposed by Sui and Liu in 2007 [223] and has
undergone  continuous  development  and  improvement  over  the  past
decade. For instance, Ding and Liu manufactured a cone-shaped SOFC
based on a YSZ electrolyte, achieving an MPD of 1.78 W cm
C
[224]. Although cone-shaped designs offer attractive prospects for mo-
bile applications, the fabrication of complex geometries presents chal-
lenges and has limited scalability efforts.

surrounding area of the fuel cell units is used for stack sealing and layout
of the fuel/air distribution manifold. Additionally, planar stacks require
upper  and  lower  end  plates  and  fixed  fixtures  for  stack  installation,

heat conduction, heat convection, and heat radiation, and their corre-
sponding relationships are as follows:

Qloss = Ql,cond + Ql,conv + Ql,rad

(12)

Outside the insulation shell, heat conduction is rare, with minimal
heat loss. After insulation, the outer surface temperature of the reactor is
◦
typically maintained at a low level (<50
C). In cases where the ambient
temperature is not excessively low, radiation heat loss from the outer
surface is negligible and can be ignored. Consequently, stack heat loss
primarily occurs through the convection process, described by Newton’s
law of cooling:

Qloss = h(Ts (cid:0) Tsurr)S

where  h  denotes  the  convective  heat  transfer  coefficient  of  the  outer
(cid:0) 1), Ts represents the temperature of the
surface of the reactor (W m
outer surface of the stack (K), and Tsurr signifies the temperature of the
external environment (K). When the stack is made more compact under
the same input conditions, operational parameters, and fuel cell char-
acteristics,  the  outer  surface  area  of  the  stack  decreases,  resulting  in
reduced heat loss through convection. Consequently, the  temperature
inside  the  stack  increases,  and  the  temperature  distribution  becomes
more uneven, posing new challenges to stack operation.

Considering the definition of thermal resistance, the expression for

heat loss can be further derived as follows:

It  can  be  observed  that  increasing  the  thickness  of  the  insulation
shell,  choosing  insulation  materials  with  lower  thermal  conductivity,
and mitigating the convection process outside the reactor are effective
methods to control stack heat loss.

When the stack operates in a stable state, the relationship between

heat production and heat loss follows the formula:

Qh = Qloss + Qads

(15)

Here, Qh denotes the total heat generation power (W) in the stack and
Qads represents the heat absorbed by the gas in the stack (W). According
to the principle of electrochemical reaction of the electrode, the source
of heat can be further subdivided:

resulting  in  poor  effective  space  utilization  for  plate-type  designs.  It
should  be  noted  that the  volumetric power  density  of  planar-type re-
actors shows an upward trend with increasing reactor power, possibly
because the increased number of cells and expanded area can increase
the proportion of effective area utilization.

4.2. Effective thermal management for compact SOFC stacks

4.2.1. Energy balance and heat transfer process in SOFC

As  the  pursuit  of  stack  compactness  continues,  the  issue  of  heat
management becomes increasingly crucial. To maintain a stable oper-
ation mode, the internal energy conservation equation is as follows

Hin = Hout + Qloss + Pe

(10)

where Hin represents the total enthalpy value of the fuel flowing into the
stack (W), Hout denotes the total enthalpy value of the fuel flowing out of
the  stack  (W),  Qloss  denotes  the  heat  loss  (W)  of  the  reactor,  and  Pe
represents the total electrical power generated by the stack (W).

The heat generated within the stack is transferred to the outside via
thermal  conduction  through  the  thermal  insulation  shell,  typically
described using Fourier’s law of heat conduction:

Qloss =

where kins  denotes the thermal conductivity of the insulation material

(W m
thermal insulation shell (K), S represents the area of the outer surface
(m2),  and  Tref  and  Lref  denote  the  equivalent  temperature  (K)  and
equivalent thickness (m) of the inner surface of the thermal insulation
shell, respectively. An equivalent linear heat conduction method is used
to simplify the influence of difference between the internal and external
surface areas.

External  heat  loss  from  the  stack  encompasses  three  mechanisms:

(18)

As  the  stack  becomes  more  compact,  the  exit  temperature  of  the
reaction gas inside the stack will be higher, leading to increased energy
loss.

4.2.2. Stack thermal management methods

The  high  operation  temperature  and  compact  integration  require
effective  heat  management.  One  challenge  is  to  maintain  the  high
operation  temperature  of  a  hot  box  with  limited  insulation  while  the
other  is  to  decrease  the  temperature  gradient  caused  by  compact
integration.

Compact thermal insulation design. Indeed, the need for heavy insu-
lation materials in SOFC systems to maintain high operating tempera-
tures  can  result  in  significant  heat  loss,  particularly  in  small-scale
portable applications. For example, in a 2-kW planar SOFC stack mod-
ule, the heat loss is estimated to account for approximately 9–10 % of the
input fuel energy [233]. Thus, effective insulation of the stack/hotbox is
crucial for maximizing internal heat utilization and achieving thermal
self-sustainable  operation.  Typically,  both  the  internal  and  external
surfaces of the stack and hotbox are lined with multiple layers of insu-
(cid:0) 1
lating materials that possess low thermal conductivity (~10
(cid:0) 1) to prevent heat loss [6]. However, a mobile SOFC system of several
K
hundred watts can require up to several kgs of thermal insulating ma-
terial to maintain high operating temperatures.

(cid:0) 1  W m

To address the size and weight concerns associated with the use of
insulation  materials,  highly  efficient  microporous  insulation  has  been
developed and utilized [19]. This type of insulation offers an order of
magnitude  lower  thermal  conductivity  than  conventional  alumina
insulation materials. In addition, researchers have explored the use of
nanoparticle-based  thermal  insulation,  which  boasts  a  significantly
(cid:0) 1 and a lower insulation
reduced thermal conductivity of 0.02 W m
mass of 150 g, as observed in a 100 W SOFC mobile system [5]. Utilizing
insulation materials with lower thermal conductivity not only improves
thermal efficiency but also reduces the volume of insulation materials,
ultimately leading to higher volumetric power density of mobile SOFC
systems.

Cathode air flow management. In previous research efforts, addressing
the issue of local hot spots in SOFC stacks has often involved supplying
excess air to the cathode and optimizing the airflow path. The utilization
of excess air could help remove the heat generated from electrochemical
reactions due to the enhanced heat convection between the cool air and
the stack. However, it is important to note that increasing the cathode
airflow can lead to greater energy consumption by the fan.

The  air  flow path  should  also be well  designed  to  ensure  uniform
distribution  and  effective  heat  management  of  the  stack.  For  planar
SOFC stacks, the air flow path depends on the channel design and the
arrangement  of  the  flow  directions.  For  example,  several  co-flow,
counter-flow  and  cross-flow  arrangements  have  been  proposed  and
optimized [148]. For tubular SOFC stacks, however, the gas channels are
formed by the tubes. Thus, the diameter of the cell as well as the gap

between the cells will directly determine the flow path. In addition, the
inlet (and outlet) arrangements also impact on the gas uniformities and
have been optimized typically with computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
methods.

For  example,  the  uniformity  of  air  flow  was  optimized  by  three-
dimensional  CFD  models  with  a  2in-2out-Z  shaped  air  flow  channel
configuration  design  for  a  36-tube  mT-SOFC  [234].  An  external
distributor was designed for a 7 × 7 tubular stack to optimize the air
flow at the location of each tube in the reactor [235], as shown in Fig. 20
(a). By comparing two mT-SOFC stacks with the same volume but con-
sisting of cells with different diameters, the air distribution was found to
be  more  uniform  for  stacks  with  smaller  tubes.  However,  the  more

compact design led to a high temperature gradient of 100 K cm
Anode  fuel  chemical  reaction  management.  SOFC  stacks  exhibit
exceptional fuel flexibility, allowing them to utilize a wide variety of
fuels, as reviewed in Section 2. When hydrocarbons or ammonia are fed
to  the  anode,  reactions  with  different  heat  effects  will  occur.  For
example,  the  steam  reforming  of  hydrocarbons  and  ammonia  decom-
position are highly endothermic  processes. The direct combination of
endothermic  reactions  in  situ  with  exothermic  electro-oxidation  re-
actions  provides  the  possibility  of  easing  the  problem  of  hot  spots.
However, since the reaction rate of the reforming reaction was found to
be  much  faster  than  that  of  electro-oxidation  reactions,  additional
temperature gradient may be introduced to the stack where a temper-
ature drop occurs at the inlet and a temperature increase subsequently
follows downstream.

The steam/carbon (S/C) ratio  and the molar fraction of  hydrocar-
bons were found to strongly influence on the temperature gradient. To
take advantage of the endothermic effect while avoiding the introduc-
tion of a large temperature gradient, the inlet compositions should be
carefully designed. For example, the fuel with an S/C ratio of 2:1 caused
a smaller cell temperature gradient than the fuel with an S/C ratio of 1:1
[237]. It is worth noting that fuel composition not only affects the heat
generation  of  electrochemical  reactions  but  also  the  fuel  reforming
process. Local heat transfer enhancement could not be effectively ach-
ieved since it is difficult to precisely control the fuel composition of fuel
cells  [148].  However,  by  adjusting  the  inlet  fuel  composition  and
promising  anode  materials/structures,  the  matching  between  the
endothermic reactions and exothermic reactions could be realized. For
example, as shown in Fig. 20(b)–a cooling strategy that separates the
layer in which endothermic NH3 decomposition occurs from the layer in
which exothermic electrochemical reactions occur was proposed [238,
239]. By adjusting the catalyst coating distribution for the cooling layer,
the  endothermic  reaction  can  be  controlled  to  achieve  the  desired
thermal management effect.

Application  of  phase  change  heat  transfer  technology.  Traditional
methods of cathode air convection heat transfer suffer from limited heat
transfer  rates.  An  innovative  thermal  management  approach  involves
using a phase change process with high heat flux capabilities. Heat pipes
are commonly used phase change heat transfer devices and have wide-
spread applications in aerospace, electronic equipment [240], commu-
nication base stations [241], waste heat boilers and various other fields
[242,243].  When  a  heat  pipe  operates,  it  achieves  minimal  thermal

placed  an  SOFC  unit  between  two  heat  pipes,  resulting  in  a  20  %

reduction in the maximum cell temperature gradient [245,246]. In our
research,  we  focused  on  the  thermal  management  of  tubular  SOFCs
using high-temperature heat pipes, as shown in Fig. 20 (c). To suit the
characteristics of tubular cells, we developed and tested an annular heat
pipe, which effectively reduced the temperature difference of the cell
from 304 to 130 K and increased the power density from 73 to 120 mW
(cid:0) 2  [247].  Furthermore,  in  a  numerical  simulation  study  involving
cm
segmented-in-series  tubular  SOFCs,  we  successfully  reduced  the  tem-
perature inhomogeneity among different sections from 111 K to 25 K by
introducing a high-temperature tubular heat pipe to replace the original
gas pipe [248].

Other studies have explored the use of high specific heat capacity
fluids such as liquid metals and saturated water as heat transfer working
media  for  the  thermal  management  of  electric  reactors  [249,250].
Despite the excellent performance of heat pipes in reducing temperature
gradients in SOFC stacks, integrating them into SOFC stacks for mobile
applications,  such  as  vehicles  and  airplanes,  still  presents  challenges.
The heavy stainless-steel envelope significantly reduces the gravimetric
power density of the stack, and heat pipe start-up times can be quite long
[251,252]. Substantial reductions in envelope weight and start-up times
are required before heat pipes can be effectively integrated into SOFC
stacks for mobile applications.

5. Conclusions and future directions

Recent  advancements  in  anode  materials,  cell,  and  stack  designs
have aimed to overcome the disadvantages and exploit the advantages
of SOFCs, notably their fuel flexibility and high efficiency, particularly
in  the  mobility  sector.  This  work  reviews  the  progress  made  in  three
critical  areas:  enhancing  fuel  tolerance  and  fuel  flexibility,  achieving
rapid start-up, and realizing stack compactness. The main conclusions
are summarized as follows.

1.  The  direct  use  of  higher  hydrocarbons  and  NH3  is  a  promising
approach  to  meet  the  requirements  of  compactness  and  rapid  dy-
namic response in SOFCs. Extensive efforts have been dedicated to
the elucidation of the mechanistic details of reaction kinetics in the
anode compartments when fed with these fuels. In situ and operando
optical techniques, such as NIRTI and Raman and FTIR spectroscopy,
have been employed to directly measure temperature distributions
and detect intermediate gas and surface species at the high operating
temperatures  of  SOFCs.  These  studies  have  provided  valuable  in-
sights into reaction mechanisms, particularly in relation to carbon
deposition and removal.

Various strategies have been explored to improve SOFC tolerance to
heavier hydrocarbons and ammonia. These strategies include the addi-
tion of reforming layers, modification of conventional Ni-based anodes,
and  use  of  perovskite  materials.  Although  the  addition  of  reforming
layers allows for the utilization of a wide range of fuels across different
temperature  ranges,  it  presents  challenges,  including  decreased

electrochemical performance and increased system complexity. For both
higher hydrocarbons and ammonia, the in situ exsolution of Ni nano-
particles  from  proton-conductive  perovskite  materials  has  shown
C,  although  this
promise,  particularly  at  temperatures  of  ~  600
approach is still primarily at the laboratory or device scale.

2.  Two  development  trends  have  emerged  to  shorten  SOFC  start-up
time  and  alleviate  thermal-stress-related  issues.  The  first  involves
lowering  SOFC  operating  temperatures  to  <600
C,  significantly
reducing  start-up  time  to  within  5  min.  For  power  density
improvement at intermediate temperatures, it is essential to main-
tain reasonable thermal shock resistance to meet the specific rapid
start-up  requirements  of  mobile  applications.  To  minimize  ohmic
loss, reducing the electrolyte thickness to approximately 1 μm may
be impractical owing to the diminished mechanical strength of thin
electrolyte layers. Instead, using electrolyte materials with high ionic
conductivity, such as LSGM, is advisable. Regarding the reduction of
polarization  loss,  cathodes  with  a  highly  porous  3D  fibrous  archi-
tecture  are  promising  candidates,  offering  both  excellent  electro-
chemical performance and high mechanical strength.

Another emerging trend is to increase the thermal shock resistance
through the development of novel configurations and geometries. MS-
SOFCs  demonstrate  higher  thermal  shock  resistance  than  traditional
ceramic-supported  systems  owing  to  the  exceptional  mechanical
strength and temperature uniformity induced by metal supports. This is
evidenced by MS-SOFCs withstanding up to 2500 thermal cycles [150]
(cid:0) 1 [151]. In terms of
and exhibiting a high heating rate of 2000
geometry, mT-SOFCs exhibit the highest thermal shock resistance. Their
compact design allows for a high volumetric power density in the SOFC
stack—an  advantage  for  mobile  applications.  Thus,  considering  both
their configuration and geometry, metal-supported mT-SOFCs emerge as
the  most  promising  candidates  for  achieving  rapid  start-up  in  mobile
SOFC systems.

3.  With regard to stack integration, mT-SOFC stacks have the highest
volume power density. This advantage is primarily attributed to the
simple sealing design and air flow distribution structure. Moreover,
this feature becomes particularly significant in scenarios wherein the
power demand is below the kilowatt level. In contrast, planar and
flat-tube  type  stacks  exhibit  similar  characteristics  and  are  more
suited for applications at the kilowatt level and above. By judiciously
increasing the size of the fuel cell units and design power of the stack,
these configurations can also achieve a higher volume power density.

Introducing chemical reactions  or  phase change  heat transfer  pro-
cesses in the stack can significantly improve temperature distribution
within the reactor, promoting long-term stable operation. However, this
approach can complicate the reaction process and structure of the stack,
potentially  leading  to  increased  weight.  In  contrast,  optimizing  the
cathode airflow path, typically through the refinement of gas channel
structures  or  distribution  manifolds,  remains  the  simplest  and  most
reliable  solution  for  achieving  improved  thermal  management  and
performance.

Although significant progress has been made in SOFC technology for
mobile applications, several areas still require further improvement to
enhance its suitability for the mobility sector. To increase fuel tolerance,
a deeper understanding of the kinetics and development of anode ma-
terials that are particularly suitable for fuel reforming at low tempera-
tures are needed. Metal-supported SOFCs with microtubular geometry,
produced  through  sintering-free  and  cost-effective  methods,  hold
promise for further improving thermal shock resistance. The stack de-
signs should be further optimized with the aid of hierarchical and hybrid
models  to  achieve  high  power  density  and  temperature  uniformity
simultaneously.

hydrocarbons. Most optical studies in the SOFC field have focused pri-
marily on detecting species related to surface reactions, especially for
light hydrocarbons. However, there is a relative lack of research on the
reaction kinetics of higher hydrocarbon conversion in SOFCs, particu-
larly the role of gas-phase reactions. Given that the C–C bonds in higher
hydrocarbons are weaker, gas-phase kinetics, including soot formation
processes under fuel-rich anode conditions, cannot be ignored. There-
fore, it is crucial to further clarify the roles of both gas-phase and surface
reaction  routes in  hydrocarbon  reforming  and  carbon  deposition  pro-
cesses, drawing from the knowledge gained in catalysis and combustion
fields.  A  combination  of  patterned  anodes  and  existing  techniques  as
well  as  other  in  situ  optical  measurement  techniques  developed  in
combustion  fields,  such  as  laser-induced  fluorescence  (LIF)  for
measuring CH [253] and PAH [254] and laser-induced incandescence
(LII) for soot measurement [255], could provide deeper insights into the
complex reaction mechanisms of higher-hydrocarbon-fueled SOFCs.

(cid:0) 2  [256]. However,  most  of  these  low-temperature

SOFCs  have  been  tested  with  hydrogen  as  the  fuel,  and  there  are
limited reports on cells operated with hydrocarbon fuels [257], which
are crucial for mobile SOFC systems. A significant challenge faced by
low-temperature SOFC operation is the mismatch between the typical
reforming processes that typically occur at temperatures above 600
C.
Therefore, the utilization of hydrocarbon fuels and ammonia should be
◦
explored at temperatures lower than 600
C, with a focus on improving
coking resistance and decomposition ability. One promising approach is
to  modify  Ni-based  anodes  with  proton-conductive  materials  such  as
barium-based oxides to enhance coking resistance and catalytic activity
at  low  temperatures.  However,  there  is  limited  research  on  the
long-term durability of SOFCs fueled with higher hydrocarbons or NH3
operating  below  600
C.  For  example,  Ni-BZCYYbPd  anodes  showed
only a slight voltage decline after 130 h of operation with ammonia at
550
C [116], while Ni-BZY anodes experienced less than 1.5 % degra-
dation per 1000 h when exposed to 11 different carbon-containing fuels
[2].

Development  of  metal-supported  microtubular  SOFCs.  To  improve
thermal  shock  resistance,  future  research  should  focus  on  metal-
supported SOFCs with microtubular geometries, which exhibit the best
thermal shock resistance among various configurations and geometries.
The main challenge lies in fabricating microtubular MS-SOFCs with high
power density and robust thermal cycling stability. Lv et al. [156] pro-
posed  methods  involve  complex  fabrication  processes  that  may  have
limitations in thermal cycling stability. Sintering-free and cost-effective
methods such as plasma spraying show promise and should be further
developed.

Optimization  of  stack  design  with  the  aid  of  hierarchical  and  hybrid
models. A high volumetric power density and low temperature gradient
are difficult to simultaneously achieve in a compact SOFC stack. Thus,
compromises must be made when designing the geometry parameters,
such  as  the  diameter, length,  and  gap  distance  in  an  mT-SOFC  stack.
These  parameters  are  mainly  optimized  through  CFD  simulations;
however, these simulations require long simulation time and multiple
iterative  cycles  of  design  and  optimization.  The  computational  effi-
ciency  could  be  greatly  enhanced  through  a  hierarchical  modeling
approach developed by the authors, which decouples the fast electro-
chemical and mass transport at the cell level from the slow heat trans-
port at the stack level [258–260]. This approach enables the use of an
agglomerative clustering algorithm to obtain the mean temperature of
each cluster after each iteration of the stack-level model. The cell-level
models  are  only  called  and  simulated  for  these  mean  temperatures,
which could reduce the computation time from several days to several
hours  while  maintaining  the  solution  accuracy  [261].  More  recently,
several artificial neutral network (ANN) models have been developed for
optimizing the homogeneity and efficiency of solid oxide cells. A hybrid

method could be further developed by combining multiphysics models
and surrogate ANN models [262], which uses the data from the multi-
physics models to train the ANN model. The fast ANN model can be used
for  accelerating  the  multiobjective  optimization,  which  makes  the
hybrid  method  promising  for  the  synchronous  optimization  of  volu-
metric power density and stack uniformity.
