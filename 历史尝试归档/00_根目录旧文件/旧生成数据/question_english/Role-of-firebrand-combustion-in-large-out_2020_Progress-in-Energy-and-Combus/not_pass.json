    "question_text": "Using the oxidation model for a cylindrical branch from the provided paper, derive the complete time evolution equation for branch diameter D_ox(t) starting from initial diameter D_o under constant flow conditions. Explain the physical mechanisms driving diameter reduction and identify the key parameters influencing this degradation process, citing specific equations from the paper.",
    "standard_answer": "The oxidation model for a cylindrical branch describes diameter reduction due to combustion processes. Starting from the differential equation provided in the paper: dD/dt = -2γ α_a (Pr^(1/3)) (ρ∞/ρ_s) (U/ν_a) ln(1+B). This equation represents the rate of diameter change due to oxidation, where γ is a constant from Reynolds number correlations, α_a is thermal diffusivity of air, Pr is Prandtl number, ρ∞ and ρ_s are ambient and solid densities, U is flow velocity, ν_a is kinematic viscosity of air, and B is the mass transfer number. The negative sign indicates diameter reduction over time. To derive the time evolution D_ox(t), we integrate this differential equation assuming constant external flow U. The integration over oxidation time t_ox from initial diameter D_o to later diameter D_ox yields: D_ox/D_o = [1 - 2(2-η) ln(1+B) Nu_D_o (ρ∞/ρ_s) (t_ox/(D_o^2/α_a))]^(1/(2-η)). The physical mechanism involves convective heat and mass transfer to the branch surface, where oxygen reacts with the char layer, converting solid carbon to gaseous products. The mass transfer number B accounts for the driving force for combustion. Key parameters influencing degradation include flow velocity U (higher velocity enhances convective transfer), density ratio ρ∞/ρ_s (affecting mass transfer driving force), thermal properties of air (α_a, ν_a), and combustion intensity through ln(1+B). The time evolution shows how diameter decreases progressively with oxidation time under constant flow conditions.",
