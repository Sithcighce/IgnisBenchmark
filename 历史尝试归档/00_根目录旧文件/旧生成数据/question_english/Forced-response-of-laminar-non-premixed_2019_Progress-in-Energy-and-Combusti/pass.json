    "standard_answer": "For a non-premixed flame with bulk axial forcing, the flame position fluctuation is given by ξ₁,ₙ(x,t) ∝ [1 - exp(i2πStx/R_f)] where St = fR_f/U₀ is the Strouhal number. The interference pattern arises from the term 1 - exp(i2πStx/R_f) = 2sin(πStx/R_f)exp[i(πStx/R_f - π/2)]. The first maximum occurs when |sin(πStx/R_f)| = 1, which requires πStx/R_f = π/2, giving x_max = R_f/(2St). Substituting St = fR_f/U₀, we get x_max = U₀/(2f). For U₀ = 2 m/s and R_f = 0.01 m, the first maximum occurs at x_max = 2/(2f) = 1/f meters. Physically, this interference pattern results from the superposition of two effects: wrinkles generated at the flame base (x=0) due to flame attachment, and disturbances excited locally throughout the flame length. The term '1' represents the spatially uniform response from the boundary condition, while exp(i2πStx/R_f) represents wrinkles convecting downstream at speed U₀. When these two components are in phase (constructive interference), maxima occur; when out of phase (destructive interference), nodes form. The first maximum at x = U₀/(2f) corresponds to a phase difference of π radians between the boundary-generated and locally-excited disturbances, where the convective time delay x/U₀ equals half the forcing period 1/(2f).",

    "question_text": "Why do non-premixed flames exhibit a 1/√St transfer function characteristic at intermediate Strouhal numbers, and what physical mechanisms cause this unique scaling behavior?",
    "standard_answer": "Non-premixed flames exhibit a 1/√St transfer function characteristic at intermediate Strouhal numbers due to the sharply varying axial dependence of mean heat release near the burner exit. This behavior arises from the concentration of heat release oscillations in the near-field region where mixture fraction gradients are highest. The physical mechanism involves phase cancellation effects combined with the spatial distribution of heat release sensitivity. As Strouhal number increases from low values, the heat release response transitions from O(1) behavior to 1/√St scaling because the oscillatory heat release regions become increasingly out of phase along the flame length. The convection of disturbances along the flame at the local flow velocity creates phase differences that lead to destructive interference. However, unlike the uniform heat release distribution in premixed flames, non-premixed flames have heat release concentrated near the base, making the interference pattern different. The 1/√St scaling specifically emerges because the axial length scale over which significant heat release occurs scales with the convective wavelength, leading to a square root dependence on Strouhal number that reflects the integrated effect of the spatially varying response.",

    "standard_answer": "The G-equation for premixed flames and Z-equation for non-premixed flames differ fundamentally in their mathematical structure and physical interpretation. The G-equation (∂G/∂t + u·∇G = s_d|∇G|) is nonlinear due to the flame propagation term s_d|∇G|, where s_d represents the displacement speed relative to the flow. This term accounts for flame propagation normal to itself, making premixed flame dynamics dependent only on the local flow velocity at the flame sheet. In contrast, the Z-equation (∂Z/∂t + u·∇Z = D∇²Z) is linear and contains a diffusion operator rather than a propagation term, reflecting that non-premixed flames do not propagate but rather exist where fuel and oxidizer mix diffusively at stoichiometric conditions. Physically, this means premixed flame dynamics are determined solely by the velocity field at the flame surface, while non-premixed flame dynamics depend on the entire velocity field throughout the domain. The G-equation is only physically meaningful at the flame surface (G=0), whereas the Z-equation describes the actual mixture fraction field everywhere, requiring solution of the entire field to extract the flame sheet position Z=Z_st.",

    "question_text": "What are the key differences in wrinkle convection mechanisms between premixed and non-premixed flames under harmonic flow forcing, and how do these differences manifest in their respective flame transfer functions?",
    "standard_answer": "The key difference in wrinkle convection between premixed and non-premixed flames lies in the axial convection speed of flame disturbances. For non-premixed flames, wrinkles convect axially downstream at the bulk flow velocity U₀, as expressed in the solution ξ₁,ₙ(x,t) ∝ [1 - exp(i2πStx/R_f)]. This occurs because non-premixed flames do not propagate - they are simply advected by the flow. In contrast, premixed flame wrinkles convect at U₀/cos²θ, which represents the vector superposition of the axial flow velocity and the axial projection of the flame propagation normal to itself. This difference arises from the fundamental distinction that premixed flames have finite displacement speed s_d while non-premixed flames have zero propagation velocity relative to the flow. These convection mechanisms manifest in the transfer functions through the interference terms: both flames show 1 - exp(i2πfx/U_c) behavior, but with different convection velocities U_c. This leads to different spatial distributions of flame wrinkling and consequently different phase relationships in the heat release response. The premixed flame's enhanced convection speed due to propagation results in shorter convective wavelengths and different interference patterns compared to non-premixed flames at the same Strouhal number.",
    "original_text": {
      "1": "The non-premixed flame does not propagate, and wrinkles convect axially downstream at the bulk flow speed, U₀.

      "2": "Both expressions also contain a term of the form, 1 - e^(i2πfx/U₀); the first term which describes spatially invariant bulk fluctuations, arises from the homogeneous boundary condition, while the second describes downstream convection of wrinkles whose axial speed is equivalent to the axial mean flow."

    "standard_answer": "The steady-state mixture fraction field solution for Model Problem A (neglecting axial diffusion, b=0) is derived from the Z-equation with step inflow boundary conditions. The solution is given by: Z₀ = R_f/R_w + Σ[2/(nπ)sin(A_n)cos(A_ny/R_f)exp(-A_n²x/PeR_f)] where A_n = nπ(R_f/R_w) are the eigenvalues. The Peclet number Pe = U₀R_f/D physically corresponds to the relative time scales for convective and diffusive processes to transport mass over a distance R_f. In the solution, Pe appears in the exponential decay term exp(-A_n²x/PeR_f), showing that transverse modes decay more rapidly with axial distance at lower Pe values where diffusion dominates, leading to broader mixture fraction profiles. The flame position is determined by solving the implicit equation Z₀(x,y=ξ₀(x)) = Z_st, where Z_st is the stoichiometric mixture fraction. This means the flame sheet lies along the contour where the mixture fraction equals its stoichiometric value. The steady solution shows that mixture fraction gradients are sharpest near the burner exit and decay downstream, with the decay rate controlled by Pe. Higher Pe values (convection-dominated) maintain sharper gradients further downstream, while lower Pe values (diffusion-dominated) lead to more rapid smoothing of concentration gradients, affecting flame length and shape.",
