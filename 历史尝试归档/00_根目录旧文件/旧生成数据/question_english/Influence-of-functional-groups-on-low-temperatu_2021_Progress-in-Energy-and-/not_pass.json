    "question_text": "How do different oxygenated functional groups (alcohols, esters, ketones, ethers) in biofuels influence the branching fractions of initial radicals formed via hydrogen abstraction by OH radicals at low-temperature combustion conditions, and what experimental techniques provide time-dependent speciation data to validate these branching fractions?",
    "standard_answer": "Different oxygenated functional groups in biofuels significantly alter the branching fractions of initial radicals formed via hydrogen abstraction by OH radicals through distinct mechanisms. For alcohols, the -OH group reduces C-H bond dissociation energies at α-carbon sites while slightly increasing bond energies at β-carbon positions, combined with hydrogen bonding interactions that create pre-reaction complexes favoring abstraction from α-carbon sites. Esters exhibit different bond energy distributions due to the carbonyl and ether oxygen atoms, affecting abstraction preferences at various carbon positions relative to both oxygen atoms. Ketones show enhanced reactivity at α-positions due to resonance stabilization of the resulting radicals, while ethers demonstrate unique patterns influenced by the oxygen atom's electronic effects. The multiplexed photoionization mass spectrometry (MPIMS) approach extends such measurements to allow simultaneous detection and characterization of a wide range of products and intermediates, increasing the detail of information that can be obtained on fundamental reaction mechanisms important to low-temperature combustion chemistry. Speciation from rapid compression machines (RCM) also yields kinetics insight at engine-relevant conditions. These experimental techniques provide time-resolved data on radical distributions and intermediate species formation, enabling validation of theoretical predictions about how different functional groups shift branching fractions toward specific radical sites, which ultimately governs the subsequent peroxy radical chemistry and chain-branching pathways in low-temperature oxidation across multiple biofuel classes.",
