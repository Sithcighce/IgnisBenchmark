    "standard_answer": "Faradaic efficiency (FE) is calculated as FE = (I_EAS / I_total) × 100%, where I_EAS is the current used for EAS and I_total is the total current. Here, I_EAS = 0.5 mA cm⁻² and I_total = 2.0 mA cm⁻², so FE = (0.5 / 2.0) × 100% = 25%. Competing HER reduces FE because it consumes electrons and protons that could otherwise be used for N2 reduction. HER is a 2-electron process kinetically favored over the 6-electron EAS process, especially on metals with strong H-binding energies. For instance, on pure transition metals, HER often dominates due to lower activation barriers, leading to FEs below 10%. Strategies to suppress HER include using catalysts with weak H adsorption (e.g., early transition metal nitrides) or engineering surfaces to repel H⁺ (e.g., positively charged single-atom catalysts), thereby increasing the proportion of current directed toward EAS.",

    "standard_answer": "Surface defects like sulfur vacancies in MoS₂ cause an upshift of the d-band center toward the Fermi level, which enhances nitrogen adsorption and activation. According to the paper, 'the d-band center of defect-rich MoS₂ upshift to the Fermi level (-0.26 eV to -0.14 eV), which leads to the enhancement of N₂ adsorption and activation.' This shift increases the density of states near the Fermi level, strengthening interactions between catalyst orbitals and nitrogen molecules. Additionally, the paper states that 'the suppression of HER provided by the defects in MoS₂ was also observed,' indicating that these defects create an electronic environment that favors nitrogen reduction over hydrogen evolution. The combined effect of enhanced nitrogen activation and suppressed competing reaction improves both activity and selectivity for electrocatalytic ammonia synthesis under mild conditions.",

    "question_text": "How do scaling relations between adsorption energies of nitrogen-containing intermediates impose fundamental constraints on the theoretical limiting potential for electrocatalytic ammonia synthesis, and what general implications does this have for catalyst design approaches?",
    "standard_answer": "Scaling relations create fundamental constraints on electrocatalytic ammonia synthesis by establishing linear correlations between adsorption energies of nitrogen-containing intermediates. According to the paper, 'the scaling relation is describing the approximate correlations between the adsorption energy of H-containing intermediates (*AHx, A = C, N, O, or S, x = 0, 1, or 2, or 3) in each elementary step of heterogeneous catalysis.' This means that adsorption energies of key intermediates like *NH and *NH2 cannot be independently optimized - if one intermediate binds strongly to the catalyst surface, the other will also exhibit strong binding due to their similar bonding configurations with metal surfaces. For electrocatalytic ammonia synthesis specifically, 'the scaling relation is also a universal rule for the adsorption energy of *N2Hy intermediates.' These scaling relations create an inherent thermodynamic trade-off where optimizing one reaction step necessarily worsens another, leading to a fundamental minimum in the limiting potential that cannot be overcome on conventional catalyst surfaces. The practical implication is that breaking these scaling relations becomes essential for advancing electrocatalytic ammonia synthesis beyond current limitations, requiring innovative catalyst design approaches that can decouple the adsorption energies of different intermediates through structural modifications or electronic tuning of active sites.",

    "question_text": "How does the extremely low sticking coefficient of N₂ molecules on Fe-based catalyst surfaces at ambient temperatures (10⁻⁶ to 10⁻⁷) influence the preference for associative versus dissociative pathways in electrocatalytic ammonia synthesis, considering the molecular adsorption states (γ-N₂, δ-N₂, α-N₂, α'-N₂) that precede final dissociation?",
    "standard_answer": "The extremely low sticking coefficient of N₂ molecules on Fe-based catalysts at ambient temperatures (10⁻⁶ to 10⁻⁷) makes the dissociative pathway kinetically unfavorable for electrocatalytic ammonia synthesis. This low sticking coefficient means only one in a million N₂ molecules contacting the surface becomes effectively activated into N atoms, creating a significant kinetic barrier for direct N≡N bond cleavage. In contrast, associative pathways proceed through molecular adsorption states where 'an adsorbed N₂ molecule goes through two physical adsorption (γ- and δ-N₂) and two chemical adsorption states (α- and α'-N₂) before the final dissociation state (β-N)'. These molecular adsorption states allow gradual hydrogenation without requiring initial bond dissociation, bypassing the high energy cost of breaking the strong N≡N triple bond. The molecular adsorption pathway enables N₂ activation through electron filling of anti-bonding orbitals, weakening the N≡N bond progressively while maintaining surface coverage that supports subsequent hydrogenation steps. This mechanism is particularly advantageous under mild electrocatalytic conditions where thermal energy is insufficient to overcome the dissociation barrier, making associative pathways more feasible despite the overall low sticking probability.",

    "standard_answer": "According to the provided paper content, the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in transition metal nitrides operates through a cyclic process involving surface nitrogen vacancies. The mechanism is described as playing an important role in electrocatalytic ammonia synthesis. The process involves nitrogen vacancies that serve as active sites where nitrogen molecules from the electrolyte can be adsorbed and activated. Specifically, the paper states that 'the Mars-van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism based on the surface nitrogen vacancies (NVs) was also considered to play an important role' and that 'the N2 molecule from electrolyte can be adsorbed and activated by the NV(s) to complete the catalysis cycle.' This indicates that nitrogen vacancies are crucial for adsorbing and activating nitrogen molecules from the electrolyte, which then allows the catalytic cycle to continue. The mechanism enables continuous operation by regenerating active sites through the vacancy-mediated adsorption and activation process. The citations do not provide detailed information about specific reduction steps of lattice nitrogen atoms or electronic structure effects on selectivity enhancement, so the explanation is limited to the documented role of nitrogen vacancies in adsorbing and activating nitrogen molecules to complete the catalytic cycle.",
