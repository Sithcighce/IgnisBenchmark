    "question_text": "In lignin-derived carbon materials for energy storage applications, how does the fundamental structure of lignin (including its aromatic backbone, functional groups, and hierarchical organization in biomass) influence the resulting material properties and performance in rechargeable batteries and supercapacitors?",
    "standard_answer": "The fundamental structural characteristics of lignin significantly influence the properties and performance of lignin-derived carbon materials in energy storage applications. Lignin's aromatic backbone, composed of methoxylated phenylpropanoid units connected by ether and carbon-carbon bonds, provides a high carbon content that makes it an excellent precursor for carbon materials. The abundant functional groups, particularly hydroxyl groups (both aliphatic and phenolic), provide active reaction sites that enable ion storage in supercapacitors and can be transformed into quinone moieties with redox activity. The hierarchical organization of lignin in biomass, where it is 'interweaved chemically with hemicellulose and wrapped subsequently outside of cellulose fibers,' creates natural templates that can be leveraged for creating porous carbon structures. These structural features contribute to lignin's advantages in energy storage applications, including its high carbon content (above 60 wt.%), which results from the large polyaromatic macromolecules and leads to substantial char yield during pyrolysis. The functional groups enable lignin to serve as binders and electrolyte materials, while the natural structure facilitates the creation of porous carbon electrodes with enhanced surface area and ion storage capacity. These properties collectively improve device performance while reducing costs, contributing to more sustainable energy storage systems.",
    "original_text": {
      "1": "Existing in most vascular plants, lignin is an amorphous three-dimensional (3D) macromolecule which connects different kinds of methoxylated phenylpropanoid units by ether bonds and carbon-carbon bonds. As a main component of plants, lignin is interweaved chemically with hemicellulose and wrapped subsequently outside of cellulose fibers.",
      "2": "Lignin, as a renewable bioresource, has been widely explored in cellulosic biofuel and several other industries. There are limited applications of lignin in the energy industry, especially in rechargeable batteries and supercapacitors, even though tremendous research work has been done regarding the use of lignin in these fields."
