    "question_text": "Why does the 'reaction front' model predict an acceleration phase followed by a deceleration phase in methane production during SS-AD, and how does the spatial distribution of inoculum influence this kinetic behavior?",
    "standard_answer": "The 'reaction front' model predicts an acceleration phase in methane production due to the increasing total surface area of methanogenic zones as individual reaction fronts expand radially from inoculum particles. Initially, when the radius (r) of each front is less than half the initial distance between fronts (R), the surface area grows as 4πr^2, enhancing substrate access and reaction rates. However, once r exceeds R, adjacent fronts begin to merge, reducing the effective surface area according to A = 4πr^2 - 6π(r - R)^2, leading to a deceleration phase as overlapping zones diminish the available reaction interface. The spatial distribution of inoculum critically affects this behavior: uniform seeding with optimal spacing maximizes the acceleration phase by delaying merger, while poor distribution can cause premature deceleration or acidification if fronts are too sparse, limiting methanogenic activity. This model underscores the importance of inoculum geometry in governing reaction kinetics through diffusion-controlled mass transfer and zone interactions.",
    "original_text": {
      "1": "During the acceleration phase (r < R), the total 'reaction front' surface area increases with the increase of r (Fig. 9a), and so does the overall methane production rate. During the deceleration phase, r exceeds R and each 'reaction front' in a cubic seeding pattern starts to merge with six others, and the remaining surface area in each 'reaction front' decreases with the increase of r as estimated by Eq. (8) (Fig. 9b). According to this equation, the surface area of each 'reaction front' will decrease with further growth of r, and the methane production rate will decrease correspondingly: A = 4πr^2 - 6π(r - R)^2.",
      "2": "Based on this model, Martin et al. [68] concluded that the initial distribution pattern of the 'seed' particles would determine the process kinetics, and a proper seeding technique should produce 'ideal seed particles' that are just large enough to accommodate a thick enough buffer layer to resist acidification, and maintain an adequate number of methanogenic zones."

    "question_text": "How does the 'two-particle' model conceptualize mass transfer between 'seed' and 'waste' particles in SS-AD, and what implications does this have for process stability and acidification?",
    "standard_answer": "The 'two-particle' model conceptualizes mass transfer in SS-AD as diffusion-driven solute transport between distinct 'seed' particles (inoculum with high methanogenic activity) and 'waste' particles (substrate with high biodegradability). VFAs produced from hydrolysis and acidogenesis in waste particles diffuse to seed particles via Fick's law, with the diffusion rate given by r_d = (2 D_e / (L_S + L_W)) (S_S - S_W), where D_e is the effective diffusion coefficient, L_S and L_W are particle diameters, and S_S and S_W are solute concentrations. This diffusion resistance is beneficial for process stability because it slows VFA transfer, reducing the risk of acidification in seed particles by preventing rapid accumulation of inhibitors. However, high substrate biodegradability can overwhelm this buffer, leading to pH drop and process failure. The model suggests that spatial separation of particles or reducing substrate digestibility can mitigate acidification by controlling solute flux, emphasizing the role of mass transfer limitations in maintaining methanogenic activity and overall system robustness in SS-AD.",
    "original_text": {
      "1": "The diffusion rate of VFAs was assumed to follow Fick’s law and to be affected by concentration gradients of VFAs and diameters of 'seed' and 'waste' particles, as suggested by Eq. (7): r_d = (2 D_e / (L_S + L_W)) (S_S - S_W), where r_d (g L^-1 s^-1) is the diffusion rate of a solute; D_e (cm^2 s^-1) is the effective diffusion coefficient of a solute in the medium; L_S and L_W (cm) are the diameters of 'seed' and 'waste' particles, respectively; and S_S and S_W (g L^-1) are the solute concentrations in the 'seed' and 'waste' particles, respectively.",
      "2": "High diffusion resistance in a solid medium was considered beneficial in reducing the rate of VFAs entering the 'seed' particles and, in turn, could mitigate the inhibition of VFAs to methanogens. Based on the model simulation, the authors also predicted that a 10% increase in the digestibility of the substrate would cause a substantial pH drop and acidification."

    "standard_answer": "The distributed model for SS-AD describes the concentration change of soluble substrates (e.g., acetate) along the vertical direction (Z) using a partial differential equation that incorporates diffusion and leachate flow. The general form is derived from mass balance principles: ∂S/∂t = D_S (∂²S/∂Z²) - q (∂S/∂Z) + Σ production terms - Σ consumption terms, where S is the soluble substrate concentration, D_S is the diffusion coefficient, q is the volumetric liquid flow rate per unit surface area, and t is time. For acetate in SS-AD, the production term includes the conversion from hydrolytic products via a stoichiometric coefficient (χ) and hydrolysis rate (k_h X f(S)), while the consumption term involves microbial uptake following Monod kinetics (ρ_max S B / (K_S + S) g(S)). Thus, the specific equation is: ∂S/∂t = D_S (∂²S/∂Z²) - q (∂S/∂Z) + χ k_h X f(S) - [ρ_max S B / (K_S + S)] g(S). This equation accounts for spatial-temporal variations, where diffusion (D_S ∂²S/∂Z²) and convection (-q ∂S/∂Z) govern mass transfer, and the reaction terms represent biochemical transformations, highlighting the interplay between transport and kinetics in heterogeneous SS-AD systems.",

    "question_text": "How does the diffusion limitation of soluble hydrolytic products in solid-state anaerobic digestion (SS-AD) at high total solids (TS) content inhibit hydrolysis, and what are the underlying mechanisms?",
    "standard_answer": "In SS-AD, diffusion limitation at high TS content inhibits hydrolysis primarily through the accumulation of soluble hydrolytic products like sugars near the microflora, which reduces the concentration gradient driving diffusion and thus slows down substrate conversion. As TS increases, the effective diffusion coefficient decreases due to reduced water content and increased tortuosity in the solid matrix, limiting solute transport according to Fick's law. This accumulation leads to product inhibition, where high concentrations of hydrolytic products suppress enzymatic activity, slowing the hydrolysis rate. Specifically, the model by Xu et al. incorporates an inhibition function where the hydrolysis rate reduction is proportional to the sugar concentration, emphasizing that diffusion resistance exacerbates this inhibition by preventing the removal of products from reaction sites. The transition in methane production rate at TS thresholds (15-20%) reflects a shift from kinetics-limited to diffusion-limited regimes, where mass transfer constraints dominate over microbial activity.",

    "standard_answer": "Modifications to ADM1 for SS-AD incorporate the impact of high TS content by adjusting kinetic parameters to reflect reduced mass transfer and microbial accessibility due to the solid medium's heterogeneity. The hydrolysis rate constant (k_h) is decreased with increasing TS because limited water availability and diffusion constraints slow the release of soluble substrates from solid particulates. For instance, authors have proposed a reduction in k_h at high TS to match experimental methane data, attributing it to unresolved diffusion limitations. Additionally, the maximum acetate utilization rate decreases with increased TS content, as model calibration suggested, due to aggravated diffusion barriers that restrict substrate availability. The half-saturation coefficient (K_S) in Monod kinetics increases with higher TS, indicating lower substrate affinity for methanogens because diffusion barriers reduce the effective substrate concentration at microbial sites. Model calibration linked this to diffusion limitations, where higher K_S values signify reduced accessibility of substrates like acetate to microbes. These adjustments shift the model from assuming homogeneity in L-AD to addressing heterogeneity and mass transfer constraints in SS-AD, aligning predictions with observed decreases in reaction rates and process stability at elevated TS levels.",
    "original_text": {
      "1": "The authors assumed that the first order hydrolysis rate constant in Eq. (1) decreased with the increase of TS content, because it is commonly observed in SS-AD that the overall reaction rate decreases with TS content [48,63].",

The authors attributed the increased K_S at high TS content to the diffusion limitations in the solid medium. According to Monod kinetics, K_S is inversely related to the affinity between the substrate and microorganisms [65]. Therefore, an increased K_S value at high TS content suggested the reduced accessibility of the substrate to methanogens, and indicated the aggravated diffusion limitation in SS-AD."
