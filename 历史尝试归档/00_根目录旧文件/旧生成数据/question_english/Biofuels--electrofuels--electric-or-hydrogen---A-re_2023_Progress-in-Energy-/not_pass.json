    "question_text": "Based on the reviewed paper, explain the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis process for converting syngas into synthetic aviation fuels, including the key chemical reactions involved and the factors that influence hydrocarbon product composition according to the specific information provided in the paper.",
    "standard_answer": "The Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis process converts purified syngas, primarily composed of hydrogen (H₂) and carbon monoxide (CO), into synthetic aviation fuels through a series of catalytic reactions. According to the paper, during FT synthesis, the purified syngas is passed over catalysts under specific process conditions to form a variety of hydrocarbons ranging from gases to waxes. The paper outlines three main chemical reactions that occur during this process: (1) 2H₂ + CO → (CH₂) + H₂O, which produces hydrocarbon chains; (2) (2n+1)H₂ + nCO → CnH₂n+₂ + nH₂O, generating paraffins; and (3) (2n)H₂ + nCO → CnH₂n + nH₂O, producing olefins. The hydrocarbon product composition is strongly influenced by the operating temperature, pressure, syngas composition, and the catalyst used. These factors determine the distribution of hydrocarbons, affecting the yield of aviation fuel components like kerosene-range hydrocarbons. The process involves catalytic steps where syngas reacts to form hydrocarbons and water, with the specific conditions and catalyst selection dictating whether lighter gases or heavier waxes are produced, which can then be further processed into aviation fuels.",
