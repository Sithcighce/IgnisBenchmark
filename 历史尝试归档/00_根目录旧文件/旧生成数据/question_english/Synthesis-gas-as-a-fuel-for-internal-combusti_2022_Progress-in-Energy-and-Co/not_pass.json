    "question_text": "How does the H2/CO ratio in syngas mixtures affect ignition delay times under engine-relevant conditions, and what are the underlying chemical kinetic mechanisms responsible for this behavior?",
    "standard_answer": "The H2/CO ratio significantly influences ignition delay times through competing chemical kinetic pathways. For high H2 concentration (i.e., CO < 60%), adding CO to H2 did not lead to a significant increase in IDT, as hydrogen chemistry dominates the oxidation process. However, at higher CO concentrations, CO exhibits an inhibiting effect on ignition. The inhibition effect is much more prominent as pressure increases from ~15 to 30 bar; that is, the CO oxidation is retarded by increasing pressure. The complex interplay between H2's promoting effect through fast chain-branching reactions and CO's inhibiting effect through radical scavenging creates a non-linear relationship between H2/CO ratio and ignition delay under engine-relevant conditions. The observed discrepancies between measured and calculated IDTs at higher pressures are due to not considering the overall activation energy correctly and HO2/H2O2 chemistry dominance in the chain-propagation regime.",
