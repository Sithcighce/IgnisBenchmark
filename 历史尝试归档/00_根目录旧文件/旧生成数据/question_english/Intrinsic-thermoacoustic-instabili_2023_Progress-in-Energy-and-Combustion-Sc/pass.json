    "question_text": "Why does the phase of the flame transfer function become fixed to multiples of π at marginal stability in systems with fully reflecting boundary conditions, and how does this constrain the oscillation frequency?",
    "standard_answer": "In systems with fully reflecting boundary conditions (e.g., closed inlet and open outlet), the jump conditions and acoustic wave propagation impose a real-valued constraint on the flame response at marginal stability (σ = 0). The combined equations from momentum and energy conservation across the flame and boundaries lead to the relation 1 + θF(ω) = (ξ/α) cot(φ₂) cot(φ₀ + φₑ + φ₁), where the right-hand side is purely real. Since F(ω) = |F(ω)|e^(iφ), this necessitates that the phase φ must be an integer multiple of π (φ = -kπ for k ∈ N₀) to ensure the left-hand side is also real. Consequently, the oscillation frequency ω is determined solely by the phase condition φ(ω) = -kπ, which for an n-τ model F(s) = ne^(-iωτ) implies ω = kπ/τ. This phase locking occurs because the acoustic field's symmetry under full reflection forces the heat release fluctuations to be in phase or anti-phase with velocity perturbations, eliminating imaginary components in the stability criterion.",
    "original_text": {
      "1": "Note that the right-hand side of Eq. (51) is real valued. Accordingly, the frequency response F(ω) = |F(ω)|e^(iφ) must be also real, which in turn makes necessary the condition φ = -kπ for k ∈ N₀.",

    "standard_answer": "For a Rijke tube with anechoic boundaries, the ITA eigenfrequencies satisfy ξ + α + αθF(s) = 0. Substituting F(s) = n e^(-sτ) gives ξ + α + αθ n e^(-sτ) = 0. Rearranging: e^(sτ) = - (αθ n)/(ξ + α). Since the right-hand side is negative, we write e^(sτ) = (αθ n)/(ξ + α) e^(iπ). Taking the natural logarithm: sτ = ln(αθ n/(ξ + α)) + i(2k+1)π for k ∈ N₀. Thus, the growth rate σ = (1/τ) ln(αθ n/(ξ + α)) and frequency ω = (2k+1)π/τ. Plugging in the values: α = 1, θ = 4.5, n = 2.5, ξ = 0.8, τ = 0.005 s. First, compute αθ n/(ξ + α) = (1 * 4.5 * 2.5)/(0.8 + 1) = 11.25/1.8 = 6.25. Then σ = (1/0.005) ln(6.25) = 200 * 1.832 = 366.4 s⁻¹. The frequency for the fundamental mode (k=0) is ω = π/τ = π/0.005 = 628.3 rad/s, or f = ω/(2π) = 100 Hz. Since σ > 0, the system is unstable. The positive growth rate indicates exponential amplification of oscillations due to the ITA feedback loop.",

    "standard_answer": "The ITA feedback loop generates self-sustained oscillations through a localized mechanism where velocity fluctuations upstream of the flame induce heat release rate fluctuations, which in turn produce upstream and downstream traveling acoustic waves. The upstream traveling waves modulate the velocity at the reference position, closing the loop without requiring external acoustic reflections. For anechoic boundaries (Rin = Rout = 0), the characteristic equation reduces to ξ + α + αθF(s) = 0, where ξ is the specific impedance ratio, α is the cross-section ratio, θ is the relative temperature increment, and F(s) is the flame transfer function. Using an n-τ model F(s) = ne^(-sτ), the critical interaction index for neutral stability (σ = 0) is nc = (ξ + α)/(αθ). Instability occurs when n > nc, with the oscillation frequency ω = (2k+1)π/τ for k ∈ N₀. This mechanism explains how thermoacoustic instabilities can persist even in the absence of acoustic cavity modes, as the ITA loop's intrinsic dynamics drive the oscillations.",
    "original_text": {
      "1": "In the case of anechoic boundary conditions the upstream and downstream acoustic reflections are zero, which leads to the absence of incoming acoustic waves (fu = gd = 0). In that scenario, the acoustic feedback loop (external blue circuit) ceases to exist. In contrast, the ITA feedback loop (inner orange circuit) not only exists, but may also be unstable.",
      "2": "The critical value of the interaction index can be computed from the neutral stability condition σ = 0. It yields nc = (ξ + α)/(αθ), which corresponds to the results of [2,4].

    "question_text": "How do area contractions at the combustor inlet and dump plane influence the phase condition for intrinsic thermoacoustic instability in a three-duct configuration?",
    "standard_answer": "Area contractions at the inlet (αc = a₀/a₁) and dump plane (α = a₁/a₂) significantly alter the phase condition for ITA instability by modifying the acoustic impedance and wave reflection characteristics. For strong contractions (αc ≫ 1 and α ≪ 1), the phase of the flame transfer function at neutral stability shifts to φ = -(4k+1)π/2, known as the π/2 criterion. This arises because the reflection coefficient Ru at the inlet becomes purely imaginary, Ru ≈ -i tan(ωl₁/cᵤ), leading to a complex-valued right-hand side in the stability equation F(s) = (ξ/θα)((Ru+1)/(Ru-1)) - 1/θ. Under the compactness assumption for the mid-section duct, the stability condition simplifies to θF(s) + 1 + (ξ/(αcα)) + (ξ s l_I)/(cᵤ) = 0, where l_I is an inertial length. The phase condition φ = -(4k+1)π/2 results from the interplay between the contraction-induced impedance changes and the duct's inertial effects, causing the heat release fluctuations to lag the velocity perturbations by 90° modulo 180°, which can either promote or suppress instability depending on the system parameters.",
    "original_text": {
      "1": "In those cases, i.e. where αc ≫ 1 and α ≪ 1, the flame response should satisfy F(ω) ≈ -i|F(ω)|e^(-iπ/2)e^(-i2kπ) = |F(ω)|e^(-i(4k+1)π/2 for k ∈ N₀. We conclude that a three-duct configuration with strong contractions at the planes ‘uc-dc’ and ‘u-d’ exhibits a phase in the flame response of -π/2 (modulo 2π) in neutrally stable cases, where σ = 0. This result was labeled ‘π/2 criterion’ in Albayrak et al. [36].",

    "standard_answer": "ITA modes and classical acoustic cavity modes exhibit fundamentally different eigenfrequency behaviors in the limit of zero flame interaction index (n → 0). For ITA modes, the growth rate σ tends to -∞, and the frequency ω approaches values determined by the ITA feedback loop's intrinsic dynamics, specifically ω = (2k+1)π/τ for anechoic conditions or ω = kπ/τ for certain reflective setups, as per the phase condition φ = -kπ. In contrast, acoustic cavity modes have growth rates σ that approach zero, and their frequencies remain close to the natural acoustic eigenfrequencies of the system. This divergence arises because ITA modes are governed by the poles of the flame's scattering matrix (satisfying ξ + α + αθF(s) = 0), which become dominant when n is small but finite, whereas acoustic modes are perturbations of the passive acoustic eigenvalues. The distinction is evident in parametric maps where ITA trajectories show large negative growth rates at low n, while acoustic trajectories originate from the imaginary axis.",
